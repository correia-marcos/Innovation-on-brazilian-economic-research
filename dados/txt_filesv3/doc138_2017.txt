Abstract 

Collusive practices carried out by cartels  have proven to be extremely  harmful to economic efficiency  and 
social  welfare.  Cartel  detection  and  damage  evaluation  have  become  a  priority  among  antitrust  agencies 
around  the  world.  However,  both  are  challenging  tasks.  In  particular,  economists  and  regulators  have 
different views on how to define cartel damage and on the most appropriate methodology to estimate it. This 
paper  aims  at  comparing  the  performance  of  different  damage  evaluation  methodologies  applied  to  the 
liquefied  petroleum  gas  cartel  in  Pará  state,  Brazil.  Cartel  damages  were  estimated  by  a  multivariate 
regression  method and  by a difference-in-differences approach. Our results suggest that estimated damages 
are sensitive to the chosen methodology, with estimated price overcharge ranging from 10% to 17%.

1.  Introduction 

Collusive practices used  by cartels  have proven to be extremely  harmful to economic  efficiency and social 
welfare. The act of two or more competing firms to coordinate decisions allows them to earn higher profits 
than they would have in a competitive environment. By forming a cartel, firms aim at maximizing their joint 
profits.  In  such  cases,  the  colluding  firms  may  exercise  market  power  by  increasing  price  above  marginal 
costs and consequently decreasing supply below the competitive equilibrium (Davis and Garcés, 2010). Not 
only does this decreases total welfare generated by the market, but it also allows cartel firms to appropriate 
most of the consumer surplus. 
 
Detecting  these  kind  of  practices  has  become  a  priority  within  antitrust  agencies  around  the  world.  Most 
countries have created laws that prohibit firms from coordinating with their competitors in order to decrease 
competition.  However,  detecting  collusion  is  not  so  straightforward  as  one  might  think.  According  to 
Harrington  (2004),  there  are  two  general  ways  of  detecting  a  cartel:  observing  the  means  by  which  firms 
coordinate  and  observing  its  final  result.  It  is  a  very  data-intensive  and  time-consuming  process  since  it 
involves estimating a competitive benchmark and comparing it to the behavior of the suspected infringers.  
 
 In  addition,  since  colluding  is  highly  lucrative  when  successful,  it  is  attractive  for  firms  to  engage  in  the 
practice when they see an opportunity. In a study performed by Ivaldi et al. (2016), on average, competition 
authorities  do  not  recuperate  excess  profits  gained  by  cartel  members,  even  in  developed  countries. 
Therefore, regulators try to find effective ways to punish companies so that the costs of colluding outweighs 
its  benefits.  These  punishments  usually  come  in  the  form  of  fines  or  compensation  payments  that  are 
calculated based on the estimated damages caused by the colluding firm. However, imposing a penalty that is 
too high can have a contrary effect, undermining the firm's ability to be an efficient market player, hindering 
the  main  objective  of  bringing  the  economy  back  to  fair  competition.  Therefore,  antitrust  agencies  must 
balance these two objectives.   
 
A  lot  of  controversy  has  surfaced  concerning  the  role  of  the  antitrust  agency  in  calculating  the  estimated 
damages. Some experts argue that the sole role  for an antitrust agency  is to implement a fine to punish the 
infringers.  Others  argue  that  in  order  to  set  an  appropriate  fine,  regulators  must  be  able  to  calculate  the 
estimated damage cause by the collusion. 
 
Calculating  damages  caused  by  a  cartel  is  an  important  step  in  the  direction  of  establishing  an  appropriate 
level  of  compensation  to  award  the  plaintiff  or  estimating  the  illegal  profits  obtained  by  the  cartelized 
industry so to impose a fine. The nature of damages calculation will depend on the legal framework in place; 
each country have different provisions as regarding to who can bring a claim and to what kind of damages 
may be vindicated1. It will also depend on the type of data that is available and the time and human resource 
constraints  in  each  case.  When  selecting  a  suitable  approach  to  calculate  estimated  damages,  analysts  will 
have to aim for a method that can lead to accurate results without hindering practicality and at the same time 
taking into consideration the legal constraints, such as information asymmetry and burden of proof.      
This paper aims at comparing the performance of different damage evaluation methodologies applied to the 
liquefied  petroleum  gas  distribution  market  in  Pará  state,  Brazil.    Cartel  damages  were  estimated  by  a 
multivariate  regression  method  and  by  a  difference-in-differences  approach.  Our  results  suggest  that 
estimated damages are  sensitive to the chosen  methodology, with estimated price overcharge ranging  from 
10% to 17%.

The  paper  is  organized  in  the  following  way.  After  this  introduction,  the  second  section  discusses  the 
microeconomic foundations of cartel damage evaluation.  
 

1.  Cartel damage evaluation: microeconomic foundations 

 
We consider a situation where the cartelized good is sold directly to the final consumer. Cartel damages can 
be calculated by estimating the difference between the price actually practiced during the cartel and the price 
that would  have  been charged  if the cartel  hadn't existed -   the so-called "counterfactual". On Figure 1 we 
have  price  represented  by  the  vertical  y-axis  and  quantity  by  the  horizontal  x-axis.  The  graph  shows  the 
observed prices and quantities implemented by the cartel, p1 and Q1, and the estimated counterfactual prices 
and quantities, p0 and Q0 that would have been observed had there not been a cartel.

The areas of rectangles  A and B represent the total estimated damage  incurred by consumers. Rectangle  A 
represents the transfer of consumer surplus to the producer additional profits and B the deadweight loss from 
goods that  would  have  been  sold  at  p0  but  are  no  longer  sold  at  p1. Equation  1  illustrates the  rent  transfer 
from the consumer to the producer: 
 

 

 

 

 

ܣ =   ሺ݌ଵ − ݌଴ሻ   ×   ܳଵ  

( 1 ) 
 
The  term  (p1  -  p0)  in  equation  1  refers  to the  "price  overcharge":  consumers  will  pay  p1  instead  of  p0  and 
purchase quantity Q1  instead of Q0. In other words, consumers are charged a  higher price than they  would 
have been under competition and have a lower quantity available in the market. By adding the two areas, you 
get the total damage to consumer from the cartel. Triangle C, on the other hand, represents the deadweight 
loss to the producer, or what it could have sold at p0 but didn't at p1.    
 
Deadweight loss is inefficient because it restricts the output available in the economy and pushes out of the 
market  potential  consumers,  who  would  be  willing  to  purchase  the  good  at the  price  interval  [p0,  p1].  The 
producer  also  suffers  with  the  deadweight  loss,  however,  since  the  transfer  in  consumer  surplus  to  the 
producer  (area  A)  is  always  larger  than  the  deadweight  loss  to  the  supplier  (area  C),  the  cartel  is  still 
worthwhile for them. While the deadweight loss is considered a problem by antitrust authorities, it is rarely 
included in the damage calculations due to the difficulty of accurately measuring it. In order to calculate the 
total amount of deadweight loss, one has to estimate five elements caused by the infringement: (i) the market 
output with the violation; (ii) the amount of the overcharge; (iii) what the market output would have been in a 
violation-free  world;  (iv)  the  price  that  would  have  been  charged  had  there  not  been  the  violation;  (v)  the 

 

3 

shape  of  the  demand  curve  between  (i)  and  (iii)  (Leslie,  2006).  In  particular,  items  (iv)  and  (v)  pose  a 
seriously challenge, since they require the analyst to estimate the elasticity of demand.   
 
Some scholars argue that trebling actual damages  may  serve as a  surrogate measure to actually  calculating 
the deadweight loss2. Others argue that if antitrust violators are not held accountable for the deadweight loss 
their actions inflict on consumers and the market, the damages owed would be an insufficient deterrent3.  
 
Determining  which  concepts  should  be  incorporated  in  the  process  of  calculating  the  damages  is  essential. 
The  first  and  foremost  step  requires  that  the  antitrust  authority  defines  the  concept  of  "damages".  The 
anticompetitive price overcharge  has  frequently  been key  for computing damages claims,  but simply using 
overcharge to quantify damage  might seriously underestimate the true damage caused  by a  cartel.  Looking 
solely at the overcharge to the direct customer of the cartel does not take into consideration the deadweight 
loss and ignores the loss of total welfare. The calculation could also become more complex if one considers 
the potential dynamic effects. These effects might increase damages if a competitive environment could have 
contributed positively to technological advances. On the other hand, it could mitigate damages if the higher 
profits earned by the cartelized firms contributed to higher investments in R&D4.  
 
Since these effects are far too complex to be measured, they are usually  ignored by the empirical  literature 
when  calculating  damages.  For  the  purposes  of  this  study,  we  will  exclude  the  deadweight  loss  from  the 
damages calculation.  
 

2.  Empirical Methods in Cartel Damage Evaluation 

When deciding on which  approach will  best be suited to estimate the damages, analyst  face trade-offs that 
have to be taken into consideration during the empirical economic analysis. While some trade-offs are related 
to the  economic  methodology  itself,  others  concern  the  legal  constraints,  such  as  the  burden  of  proof,  that 
will define the economic approach. 
 
The first and main concern when calculating the counterfactual in cartel cases is to be as accurate and close 
to  the  truth  as  possible.  In  order  to  get  there,  experts  have  to  balance  the  trade-off  between  accuracy  and 
practicality5. Quantifying the effects of a collusive conduct requires the creation of a counterfactual scenario, 
where you try to estimate what the prices would have been if there had been no cartel. The closer to the real 
world  a  model  gets  the  more  complex  it  becomes.  In  statistical  terms,  accuracy  can  be  defined  as  being 
correct on average and precise. Being correct on average is not the same as being close to the truth; you could 
be greatly over or underestimating the true value of the damages in one case and still be statistically correct 
on average. This is why one also has to consider the precision of the calculation, or how close to the truth is 
the  estimate.  Note  that  it  is  better  to  have  a  biased  and  precise  estimate  than  to  have  an  unbiased  but 
imprecise  one.  The  more  economic  assumptions  that  is  employed  in  the  calculation  the  more  precise  the 
estimation will be. However, if the assumptions are incorrect, you will obtain biased results. 
                                                
2  The  employment  of  trebling  in  place  of  actually  calculating  the  damages  caused  by  the  deadweight  loss  is  still  a  very 
controversial issue among scholars. While some argue that trebling damages can mitigate the effect of DWL, others argue that it 
does  not,  since  it  still  excludes  consumers  that  were  forced  out  of  the  market.  In  addition, they  argue that  since  many  collusion 
cases  are  settled,  trebling  doesn't  even  take  place  so  it  does  not provide  full  compensation  for  the higher  prices  consumers  who 
continued to buy the product had to pay (Leslie 2006) 
3 Leslie, C.R., "Antitrust damages and deadweight loss," The Antitrust Bulletin, 51(3), pp. 521-567, 2006. 
4 A studied performed by Andrea Günster, Mathijs van Dijk and Martin Carree concluded that in general cartels hinder innovation 
by decreasing investments in R&D because there is lower incentives to invest in new products and technologies. However, in some 
rare cases, higher profits could contribute to R&D investments.  
5 This discussion of accuracy and practicality is based on European Commission (2011).

This  leads  us  to the  concept of  practicality.  The  damage  calculation  process  should  be  conducted  within  a 
reasonable timeframe and with the available resources. Antitrust authorities experience time constraints and 
have a limited amount of manpower that can be allocated to a specific project. Therefore, it is very important 
that the company  makes the necessary  information readily available to the authorities or economic analyst. 
Another key factor that helps ensure practicality is proper data submission and presentation style. Economists 
must  provide  the  raw  data  and  any  adjustments  made  to the  data  and  the  statistical  method  used  to  derive 
your results so that a second expert can easily verify the results. This also facilitates the comprehension of the 
methodology and results by judges and lawyers. The expert must be prepared to explain the logic behind the 
chosen method, so the more practical the approach the easier it is to explain. The choice between accuracy 
and  practicality  will  vary  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and  will  be  highly  influenced  on  the  data  available. 
Sometimes, it will not be possible to obtain an accurate empirical estimate within a reasonable timeframe or 
with the available resources. In such cases, it is up to the legal system to determine how to proceed. 
 
Finding a reasonable balance between accuracy and practicality affects how each expert tailors his economic 
analysis. It includes the decision of which data to use and which ones to leave out, the number of variables 
and which method to employ. Working with data submitted by parties involved in the investigation will most 
likely  lead  to  more  accurate  estimations.  However,  working  with  public  data  not  only  shortens  the  data 
collection  period,  but  also  makes  you  less  susceptible  to  data  manipulation  and  allows  for  cross-firm 
comparisons. 
    
The  number of  variables to include  in  your analysis  is also key to achieving unbiased and accurate results. 
Although  it  is  important to  control  for  factors that  affect  price,  including  all  demand  and  cost  shifters,  not 
only  leads to an  intensive data collection process but also  may reduce the accuracy of the  estimates. If the 
variables are highly correlated and the individual impact of each variable is not of interest in the analysis, it 
would  be  enough  to  include  only  the  representative  variables  and  control  for  the  combined  effect.  On  the 
other hand, omitting an important variable will lead to biased estimates.  
 
Finally, in many jurisdictions, empirical economic evidence is not sufficient to prove a misconduct in cartel 
cases. Investigators are required to present evidence of explicit communication  between  infringing  firms  in 
order to meet the legal standard of proof. In Brazil, although rare, it is possible to prosecute and condemn a 
cartel even when there are no concrete evidence of exchanges between colluding firms. In some few cases it 
has  been  enough  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  economic  indicators  of  a  collusion,  however  in  these  cases  the 
burden of proof were much higher. The burden of proof for proving a collusive conduct is also higher when 
quantifying damages  but that also  varies among  jurisdictions. Once the antitrust authority  has  been able to 
achieve  the  required  standard  of  proof,  the  burden  of  proof  shifts  to the  defendant,  who  will  then  have  to 
prove that the authority's assertions are wrong. When legal standards are higher, experts might be required to 
present more accurate results, which may lead them to rely on more than one empirical approach. This brings 
us back to the trade-off of practicality and accuracy.  
 

2.1 The Multivariate "Before and After" Approach 

 
A simple approach in quantifying price overcharge is to compute the difference between the cartel price and 
the  perfect  competitive  price.  The  multivariate  approach  closely  follows  this  idea  by  estimating  a  reduced 
form regression of the price level on a dummy indicating the cartel period and on demand and cost shifters 
that  control for various exogenous influences on price. It is important to note that econometric analysis does 
not  prove  causality  but  it  seeks  to  establish  statistically  significant  relationship  between  the  dependent 
variable and the other explanatory variables.  

5 

 

 
Generally speaking, the estimated regression has the following specification  
 

݌௧ =   ߛܦ௧ +   ݔ௧ߚ +   ߝ௧ 

 

 

 

 

( 2 ) 

 
where  
pt: price level at period t 
xt: vector of demand and cost shifters 
Dt : dummy variable indicating the cartel period (D = 1  if cartel was active in period t; D = 0 otherwise) 
 
Our parameter of interest is γ, which may be interpreted as the estimated price overcharge during the cartel 
period. If the coefficient γ is positive and statistically significant, we have some evidence on the existence of 
a cartel. 
 
Overall, the before and after models are practical and  lead to sufficiently accurate results without requiring 
too much data or human resources. However, differently from the structural model that we are going to see 
further  ahead,  it  ignores  the  deadweight  loss  from  the  calculation  so  that  damages  would  be  equal  to  the 
estimated overcharge.   
 
3.2 Yardstick and the Difference-in-Differences Methodology 

When  dealing  with  a  cartel  that  has  not  been  stable  throughout  its  existence  or  when  supply  and  demand 
conditions fluctuated in a significant way along the years, a better way to estimate the counterfactual price is 
to  use  the  yardstick  approach.  This  method  quantifies  damages  by  comparing  the  collusive  prices  with  the 
ones that were practiced in other competitive but comparable markets. It can be considered an extension to 
the  multivariate  before  and  after  time-series  approach  by  adding  a  cross-sectional  dimension  in  the 
comparison. This method is challenging because the two products must be similar in terms of demand, costs 
and  market  structure  and  should  at  least  be  from  the  same  country  so  that  institutional  shocks  are  similar. 
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the benchmark chosen is cartel-free or unbiased.  
 
One can also unify the before and after approach with the yardstick approach into a single framework known 
as  the  difference-in-difference.  The  difference-in-difference  approach  is  an  econometric  method  that  uses 
panel data to run cross-sectional data from different periods and markets, which increase the validity of the 
results. If you have relevant data on various regions (some that are affected by the cartel and some that are 
not), the difference-in-difference method will allow you to compare the differences in both markets.  
 
The purpose of implementing this approach is to evaluate the impact of a treatment on an outcome Y across 
different  groups.  In  this  case,  we  will  be  dealing  with  two  groups:  one  that  has  received  treatment 
denominated T=1, and another that does not receive the treatment, T=0, which will be our control group. The 
analysis will be performed in two periods where t=0 indicates the pre-treatment period, and t=1, indicates the 
post-treatment  period.  Each  individual  or  group  will  have  two  notations,  one  pre-treatment  and  one  post-
T  as  the  sample  averages  of  the  outcome  for  the  treatment 
treatment.  To  simplify,  let  us  have  Ȳ0
group before and after treatment, respectively, and Ȳ0
 
The outcome Yi can be modeled as: 
 

C the sample averages for the control group.

The coefficients α, β, γ, δ are unknown parameters representing: 
α = constant term  
β = treatment group specific effect 
γ = time trend common to control and treatment groups 
δ = true effect of treatment 
 
The difference-in-difference estimator is defined as the difference in average outcome in the treatment group 
before  and  after  treatment  minus  the  difference  in  average  outcome  in  the  control  group  before  and  after 
treatment.

Given the unbiased estimator assumption, if we take the expectation of the ߜመ
 

஽஽ estimator we get: 

ߜመ
஽஽ = ܧሾܻത
்ሿ − ܧሾܻത

The  estimator  in  Equation  5  is  basically  taking  the  average  difference  in  outcome  Yi  for  the  pre  and  post-
treatment period in the treatment group  and subtracting the average difference for the pre and post-treatment 
period for the control group.  
 
However,  like  with  any  other  model,  the  difference-in-difference  approach  also  has  its  downsides.  Two 
assumptions must hold in order to guarantee an unbiased difference-in-difference estimators:  i) there must be 
a  common  trend  between  prices  from  the  control  group  and  the  treatment  group  in  the  periods  before  the 
shock,  i.e.  treatment  and  control  groups  should  be  expected  to  follow  similar  factor  processes  prior to the 
treatment period; and ii) treatment and control groups should not, on average, experience differential shocks 
in the post-treatment period. If any of these assumptions do not hold, then there is no guarantee that the DD 
estimator  is  unbiased.  A  second  caveat  is  related  to  the  control  group  formation.  Finding  a  relevant  and 
accurate benchmark, that has similar characteristics to the  market  in question without having  been affected 
by a cartel is not an easy task.  
 

3.3 Cost-plus Approach 

The  Cost-based  Approach  uses  financial  information  of  an  industry  or  company  to  calculate  the 
counterfactual price using a bottom-up analysis. The analyst will take the relevant production costs and add a 
reasonable profit margin that could have emerged in an otherwise competitive market. Typically, the average 
costs will be calculated based on accounting data or information available from management reports.  
 
However, it is a somewhat challenging method to employ. First, calculating an appropriate profit margin to 
add  to  the  average  unit  cost  of  production  can  be  quite  difficult  in  practice.  Also,  since  in  most  cases  the 
accounting  costs  do  not  reflect  actual  economic  costs  it  becomes  extremely  difficult  for  investigators  to 
calculate  a  robust  cost  estimates.  In  addition,  some  may  consider  this  method  an  oversimplification  of  the 
factors that affect price  in a  cartel-free world -  it assumes that competitive costs and price-cost  margin are 
constant when the cartel is in place (Clark et al., 2004).  

7 

 

It is also a method with high data requirement and is time consuming. However, it could be a good proxy for 
a  counterfactual  when  dealing  with  companies  in  markets  where  there  is  a  constant  relationship  between 
price and cost.   
 
3.4 Structural Models and Market Simulation  

Contrary  to  the  yardstick,  a  comparator-based  model,  the  structural  model  relies  on  a  simulated-base 
benchmark to calculate damage. The Simulation method, also known as the "Oligopoly Model Method," as 
described by Clark et al (2004), aims at calculating the relevant market data on costs, price, quantities, and 
profits in a collusion-free world. It uses economic models based on industrial organization theory to predict 
the  effect  of  the  shock  on  prices  and  output.  It  is  worth  highlighting  that  this  approach  is  the  only  one 
discussed in this paper that has the capacity of measuring the deadweight loss. 
 
The  economic  analyst  will  build  an  economic  equilibrium  model  to  determine  prices,  quantities,  costs  and 
marginal costs in a cartelized industry. Once assumptions are specified and the model is laid out, the prices 
that would have been under competition can be calculated and compared to those practiced during the cartel. 
This model also assumes an oligopolistic behavior, so it is important to decide whether you are dealing with a 
Bertrand or Cournot competition. This  method requires  information on costs,  market structure and demand 
and a profound understanding of the market.  
 
Even though  it has an unique capacity of capturing a parcel of the damage that cannot be  measured by the 
other  models,  it  is  a  much  more  complicated  and  time  consuming  method.  It  is  highly  sensitive  to  the 
assumptions  made  about  cost  and  demand  parameters  and  how  they  affect  prices.  Also,  since  it  is  a  data-
intensive method it is sensitive to changes in its settings and parameter values. Damage quantification based 
on simulation methods might be closest to real-world competitive market outcomes, since they do not rely on 
cost data provided by defendant and are very transparent for outsiders. However, not only does it present the 
largest challenges for economists with regard to the high level of market knowledge that is required, it also 
faces difficulties in being validated in court as an appropriate damage calculation method. Since it is a more 
complex  method  that  involves  strong  assumptions  on  a  "would  be"  demand,  it  tend  to  be  more  vulnerable 
towards  courts.  Judges  and  other  non-experts  may  face  some  difficulty  in  interpreting  the  results  and  the 
model  specifications,  therefore  economists  have  to  be  very  educated  with  this  kind  of  model-building  and 
have to prepare good documentation for its replication (Doose, 2013).    
 
3.5 Comparing Methodological  Approaches 
   
In  order  to  ensure  the  robustness  of  the  estimates,  practitioners  generally  apply  various  methodologies  to 
assess  cartel  damage.  In  general,  different  methods  applied  to  identical  cartel  episodes  did  not  result  in 
significantly different estimates. 
 
Connor  and  Lande  (2008)  concluded  that  the  multivariate  before  and  after  approach  usually  provided 
overcharges  estimates  that  were  higher  than  other  econometric  models  applied  to  the  same  cartel  episode. 
One  possible  reason  for  such  result  is  that  analysts  using  the  Before  and  After  Method  may  have  failed  to 
adjust  for  all  competitive  factors  that  influence  the  competitive  benchmark  price.  The  Cost-based  and 
Yardstick approaches yielded even higher overcharge estimates. One explanation for these higher estimates 
is that using cost or profits fail to fully account for all competitive industry cost. In the Yardstick approach 
cases, analysts may have underestimated quality differences between the products.

For  practicality  purposes,  many  countries  recur  to  more  straightforward  methods  when  determining  cartel 
damage in cases of relatively minor economic importance. A simple method relies on results from previous 
cartel cases. This method takes into account the average overcharge observed in past known cartels and apply 
it  to  any  current  case.  There  is  an  increasing  number  of  data  on  overcharge  estimation  available  in  cartel 
cases  which  allows  us  to  estimate  the  average  overcharges.  Connor  and  Lande  (2008)  reviewed  674  cartel 
damage cases. They found that the majority of detected cartels have an estimated overcharge between 10% to 
20%  (Figure  2).  The  empirical  evidence  of  existing  overcharge  estimations  suggests  a  high  variation  of 
overcharges across various cases, highlighting the need for case specific estimates. Given the high variation 
and  the  lack  of  precision  of  this  method  in  determining  the  actual  overcharge  in  any  given  case,  not  all 
jurisdictions admit it as an adequate measure of effective damage. 
 
   

Figure 2: Historical overcharge estimations 

 

The  United  States  Sentencing  Guidelines  established  an  overcharge  estimate  of  10  percent  of  the  total 
volume of commerce. Compared to the figures in Figure 2, one can verify that the fines applied by the US 
antitrust  agency  on  cartels  were  not  nearly  enough  to  hinder  the  practice.  Later,  the  agency  doubled  that 
amount in order to incorporate deadweight loss and other previously neglected damages.  
 

3.  Empirical application: liquefied petroleum gas cartel in Pará, Brazil 

 In March 2005, the Federação Nacional de Revendedores de Gás Liquefeito de Petróleo ("Fergas"), made a 
complaint  to  CADE  about  potential  anticompetitive  practices  being  carried  out  by  the  three  mains  gas 
distributors in the state of Pará: Tropigás, Minasgás and Parágas. 
In December 2016, CADE sentenced the company Parágas Distribuidora Ltda. for the formation of an illegal 
cartel in the liquefied petroleum gas distribution market.6 According to the leading opinion, the evidence in 
the  case  files  showed  that  Parágas  was  guilty  of  implementing  a  price  fixing  scheme  with  its  competitors. 
Furthermore, the firm was found guilty of creating vertical restrictions, such as fixing retail prices, refusing 
to  supply  the  LPG  to  retailers  from  other  distributors,  for  requiring  its  retailers  to  sign  exclusivity 
agreements, and finally for selling the LPG to unauthorized retailers, as means to enforce the collusion. 
 

                                                
6 According to the case  files, all three companies in the cartel were found guilty of  collusion. However, Tropigas and Minasgas 
entered into a leniency agreement and settled with CADE and were therefore not tried together with Parágas. 

9 

 

Despite the consensus on the guilt, a harsh controversy ecloded concerning damage evaluation. The CADE 
advisor  responsible  for  the  leading  opinion,  Ms.  Cristiane  Alkmin,  interpreted  that  in  order  to  apply  an 
appropriate fine to the colluding firm, the best approach was to calculate the estimated overcharge and undue 
gains for the firm. She suggested that, "when pecuniary sanctions are not a function of the damage caused to 
society, one can make the mistake of charging beyond or below the 'appropriate penalty' for that damage that 
was caused to society.7" If the  fines paid by the  infringing  firms  are restricted to the price overcharge, the 
damage  to  society  will  not  be  fully  repaired.  The  advantage  gained  through  an  illicit  act  is  lower  than  the 
welfare loss, since it disregards the deadweight loss. However, in her opinion, calculating damages, even if 
just an estimate, can serve as a reference for the establishment of the fine.   
In  the  LPG  case,  the  variables  for  cartel  duration,  quantity  sold,  and  the  price  fixed  by  the  cartel  were 
available  in  the  evidence  collected.  The  counterfactual  price  was  to  be  calculated  by  a  chosen  method  for 
damage  estimation.  For this  case,  she  chose  the  difference-in-difference  approach.  The  damage  calculation 
will be a proxy of the sum of the undue gains by the participating firms in the cartel during its duration.  
 
The relevant market considered for the calculation was the LPG distribution in the state of Pará. The selected 
period  for  the  cartel  was  from  February  2003  to  April  2005  and  the  non-cartel  period  was  August  2001 
through  January  2003.  For  the  control  group,  she  used  two  criteria  for  selection.  In  the  first  group,  she 
selected the states that showed the most competitive prices, taking the average LPG price in each state and 
comparing  it  to  the  HHI.  As  she  observed,  the  more  companies  acting  in  that  market,  the  lower  was  the 
average price of the state. The chosen states were: RJ, AL, SP, and MG. For the second control group, she 
selected all the states in Brazil where there had been no cartel condemnations during the period.     
 
 However,  her  methods  were  scrutinized  by  another  voting  member,  Mr.  Marcio  Oliveira.  Although  both 
advisors agreed on the fact that the companies were guilty of cartel  formation, Mr. Oliveira disagreed with 
some of the premises of the model applied in the calculation as well as with the chosen method for setting the 
fine.  
First, he interprets that it is not CADE's role to recover damages but in fact to establish a penalty for these 
anticompetitive practices. When relying solely in overcharges to calculate the penalty, one is not taking into 
consideration  other  undue  advantages  gained  from  the  collusion,  such  as  the  exclusion  of  a  potential 
competitor from the market. In addition, one cannot guarantee that all overcharges will eventually become an 
undue gain to the company;  part of the  increase  in the equilibrium  price  may  be due to shocks that would 
have  affected  the  market  regardless  of  the  cartel.  In  Baker  (1989),  he  elaborated  on  the  difficulty  of 
identifying  cartel  formation  when  there  is  an  environment  of  uncertainty  concerning  price.  Simply 
calculating  estimated  overcharges  does  not  allow  you  to  differentiate  undue  gains  from  natural  market 
fluctuations.  Therefore,  Mr.  Oliveira  argued  that  a  better  method  would  be  to  take  an  average  of  the 
overcharges result from multiple approaches, so to avoid under or oversetting the fine. 
 
Furthermore, Mr. Oliveira showed concerns on Ms. Alkmin's choice for the control group. He stated that it is 
impossible to know for a fact whether a specific state was a good counterfactual for the estimate, since even 
if there was no cartel condemned in the chosen states during the period of the study, it does not guarantee that 
no cartel was in place. This is a common criticism to the difference-in-difference method; although there are 
some  steps  that  can  be  taken  to  secure  a  control  group  with  benchmarks  that  have  not  be  affected  by  the 
shock, it is impossible to know for sure.

4.1 Empirical Analysis 
 
In this section, we revisit Ms. Alkmin's calculations in order to provide more robustness to the results. First, 
besides  using  the  difference-in-difference  method  as  the  only  means  of  calculation  as  was  done  by  the 
CADE, we added a second model to estimate the damage. We start the damage evaluation with a multivariate 
before and after approach and then move on to the difference-in-difference to corroborate our results.  
 
To  mitigate  the  concerns  raised  by  Mr.  Oliveira  on  the  validity  of  the  benchmark  for  the  difference-in-
difference  model,  the  states  chosen  for  the  control  group  were  selected  with  more  scrutiny.  In  addition  to 
choosing states based on their market competitiveness, like was done by CADE, we also tested for a common 
tendency in those states to avoid using a control group that had factors influencing price that were absent in 
the  treatment  state.  This  allows  us  to  test  for  the  common  trend  hypothesis  in  the  difference-in-difference 
method and to increase the robustness of our results.   
          
In order to estimate the damage caused by the  LPG cartel  in Pará we used the  information available  in the 
discovery process  as well as data collected  from  public sources. The dates established  for the cartel period 
were the same ones used by CADE in their damage calculations, February 2003 to April 2005. Analyzing the 
cartel in the same time interval as CADE allows for the comparison of our results with the ones obtained by 
Ms. Alkmin. We used the ANP8 portal to obtain monthly data for the distribution and retail price of LPG sold 
in pressure canisters (P-13) in each state from July 2001 to December 2016. Figure 6, illustrates the behavior 
of  the  two  price  series.  Although  there  are  evidences  of  price  fixing  at  the  retail  level  (a  demand  by  the 
distributors  themselves),9  it  was  chosen  to  use  the  series  for  distribution  price,  where  there  are  concrete 
evidence of a price fixing scheme.

Besides LPG distribution price, proxies for demand shifters were used as independent variables to control for 
exogenous  factors that could affect the dependent variable and potentially  mislead the  final conclusions on 
the effect of the cartel. For such, were used LPG consumption, provided by the ANP, income and industrial 
production, collected from IPEA Data and IBGE, respectively.  
 

                                                
8 Agência Nacional de Petróleo - Brazilian Oil and Gas Agency 
9  In  the  discovery  process,  retailers  claimed  that  distributors  would  determine  the  prices  that  should  be  practiced  with  the  final 
consumer. 

11 

 

For LPG apparent consumption, data was only available  from 2007 to 2016, in  Kilogram units. Therefore, 
LPG distribution sales was collected from the ANP website and used as a proxy for consumption from 2000 
to 2006. Additionally, a dummy variable was created to indicate the periods in which the cartel was active.  
 
Unfortunately, data on cost shifters were not publicly available and they were not included in our empirical 
analysis. In the case of the LPG distribution market, the main cost variable that could potentially affect price 
would be the transportation cost, which constitutes of over 50% of the total cost of the product10. This raises 
a  couple  of  problems:  first, the  cost  is  a  determinant  of  LPG  prices  and  therefore  our  regression  estimates 
may  be  plagued  by  omitted  variable  bias.  This  may  create  endogeneity  issues  in  both  the  before  and  after 
multivariate  analysis  and  the  difference-in-difference  approaches.  This  should  not  be  a  problem  in  the 
difference-in-difference method if the unobserved cost shifters vary in similar way across cartelized and non-
cartelized  markets.  If  the  cost  structure  is  similar,  than  they  would  cancel  out  when  calculating  the 
differences. However, it may become a problem for the difference-in-difference approach if cost structure of 
the LPG distributors in Pará are different than those in the  control group. Second, lack of cost  information 
prevents us from employing structural methods such as the cost-plus or simulation approaches. Therefore, in 
this  study  we  will  work  with  an  implicit  assumption  that  the  transportation  costs  for  LPG  firms  vary  in  a 
similar way across treatment and control groups markets.     
 
4.1.1 Estimation results  

Table  1  presents  the  regression  results  for  the  multivariate  regression  specifications.  Analyzing  the 
coefficient on the cartel dummy, it is possible to conclude that LPG distribution prices were between 10% to 
13% higher while the cartel was active. Not only were the cartel dummy coefficients statistically significant 
but  they  also  showed  little  variation  given  the  different  regression  specifications,  corroborating  the 
robustness of the price overcharge estimate.

Following Ivaldi et al. (2016) and Levenstein, Suslow and Oswald (2003)11, it was considered sales affected 
by the collusive practice in order to calculate the cartel's excess profits derived from the price overcharge.12 
Total LPG sales throughout the cartel period was of R$ 7,722,887,257 amounting damages to something in 
between R$ 783,873,056 to R$ 1,016,331,963.13  
 
However, the multivariate before and after methodology can be somewhat limited when estimating damages 
since  it  only  analyzes  the  market  in  Pará,  where  the  cartel  was  instated.  In  order  to  have  a  more  reliable 
estimate  for  the  damages,  it  is  important  to  compare  the  affected  market  with  a  market  that  has  been 
operating  cartel  free.  The  difference-in-difference  method,  takes  into  consideration  cartel-free  markets  that 
can be used as a counterfactual for the analysis.   
 
In order to apply the difference-in-difference approach to estimate cartel damage, one must first identify the 
treatment  and  control  groups,  as  well  as  the  period  the  cartel  was  active.  In  addition,  the  analyst  has  to 
determine the method and model specifications. It is important to point out that the choice of control group 
was an important element of discussion between CADE advisors in their opinion. As previously mentioned, 
the difference-in-difference method requires two basic assumptions: i) the markets for the control group must 
not  be  affected  by  the  cartel;  and  that  ii)  the  prices  in  the  different  markets  must  follow  a  common  trend. 
These  groups  should  have  similar  characteristics,  except  for  the  price  shock.  The  treatment  group,  in  this 
case, will be the state of Pará and the endogenous variable the LPG distribution price. The period of the cartel 
considered  will  be  from  February  2003  to  March  2005  (27  months),  the  same  period  used  by  CADE  to 
calculate the damage.14 The data collected for the control group was retrieved from the same sources used to 
collect the data for the state of Pará: ANP, IPEA Data, IBGE.   
  
In  order  to  satisfy  the  first  requirement  for  the  difference-in-difference  method,  the  first  objective  was  to 
select states where there had been no cartel activity in the market in question during the period being studied. 
However, knowing for a fact that a market is cartel free is nearly impossible. Just because no cartels had been 
condemned during that period, it does not mean that there was  no cartel. Due to the difficulty of detecting 
cartels,  it  is  possible  that  a  cartel  could  be  operating  in  any  given  state  without  the  knowledge  of  the 
authorities.  Therefore,  the  states  which  demonstrated  to  have  a  lower  market  concentration  based  on  the 
Herfindahl  Index  (HHI)  were  the  main  focus  of  the  analysis.  The  HHI  was  calculated  for  all  the  states  in 
Brazil  in 200715 and  in 2016.  Although this  method does not eliminate the danger of using a  state where a 
cartel was active but unknown, it is a way to mitigate these risks. Based on the HHI, the states of São Paulo, 
Pernambuco, Santa Catarina and Paraná were the only four states which presented a HHI below 0.25 in 2007 
and  maintained  a  similar  level  of  competitiveness  in  2016.  Therefore,  they  were  selected  as  our  potential 
control group.

the BRICS and in Developing Countries. Switzerland Springer, 2016. pp. 103-133 
12 The value for total LPG sales in the distribution level was arrived at by multiplying the LPG sales from February 2003 to April 
2005  with  the  respective  monthly  LPG  distribution  price.  To  arrive  at  the  damages,  we  used  a  variation  of  Equation  1,  but  in 
percentage, where A = (p1-p0) x Q1 or the total sales multiplied by the γ = (p1-p0)/p0 , in this case 10% to 13%.  
13 LPG sales are described in the values of 2005, when the cartel ended. If we update these values up to December 2016 using the 
IPCA,  LPG  sales  would have  been  R$  14,929,176,194 in today's  terms. That  would  equal  damages  in  between  R$  1.5  -  R$  1.9 
billions. 
14  In  order  to  determine  the  estimated  period  for  the  cartel  activity,  CADE  used  evidence  collected  during  the  investigation, 
including recordings from company  employees and other documents that indicated a February as the most probable date for the 
beginning of the cartel and March 2005 as its dissolution.  
15 The year of 2007 was the earliest data available for LPG consumption. As mentioned earlier, for the years between 2000 to 2006, 
a proxy was used.  

13 

 

To satisfy the second condition for the difference-in-difference model, the prices for the state of Pará and the 
control group were tested for a common trend. The first analysis consisted of a visual inspection of the LPG 
distribution prices in both the treatment and control groups.  
In Figure 4, it is possible to see that Pará's price curve becomes steeper than that of the other states around 
March 2003.  Although there  is  an upward trend  in price among  all the  states, it seems that the  increase  in 
Pará  around  the  period  of  the  beginning  of  the  cartel  was  more  significant  than  in  the  others  state  of  the 
control group.

 In  addition,  a  more  formal  trend  test  was  performed  in  order  to  confirm  the  conclusions  from  the  visual 
inspection. Table 2 shows the outputs for the global common trend test conducted with the control group. We 
will focus on the second regression, which takes into consideration the fixed effects. The idea of the common 
tendency  test  using  fixed  effects  is  that  it  allows  for  the  control  of  non-observable  variables  that  do  not 
change throughout time.  
 
In  table  2,  the  variable  "trend"  represents  the  average  time  trend  for  Pará  state. The  second  column  shows 
that the cross-term trend coefficients  for São Paulo  and Pernambuco are  not statistically  significant, which 
means that there is evidence of a common trend for these states. In other words, the trend in these states do 
not  diverge  from  Pará  "trend".  The  coefficients  for  Santa  Catarina  and  Paraná,  on the  other  hand,  strongly 
suggest the contrary, which  means that some shock other than the cartel  is  making the trend  in these states 
diverge from the one in Pará. This leads us to reconsider them as a good benchmark for the control group.

Lastly, a local common trend test, which allows for the treatment variable to interact with time dummies, was 
carried out. The objective of this test was to create interactions of time dummies and the treatment indicator 
for  the  first  two  pre-treatment  periods  and  two  post-treatment  periods.  After  creating  the  pre  and  post-
treatment dummies, the following model was regressed: 
        

ݕ௜௧ = ߣ௜௧ + ߜ௜௧ + ߚିଵܦ௜௧ + ߚିଶܦ௜௧ + ߚିଵܦ௜௧ + ߚଵܦ௜௧ + ߚଶܦ௜௧ + ߝ௜௧  

where y is the outcome for state i at time t and λ and δ are state and time fixed effects.

In order to validate the difference-in-difference assumption, the pre-treatment dummies should be the same 
for  both  the  control  and  treatment  groups,  which  means  that they  should  not  be  statistically  significant.  In 
addition,  the  post-treatment  coefficients,  β+1  and  β+2,  should  be  positive  and  statistically  significant.  The 
intuition here is that prices should follow a common trend in the pre-treatment period and diverge after the 
shock in the post-treatment period.  
      
Table  3  shows  the  results  of  the  local  common  trend  test.  Column  1  includes  all  four  states  in  the  control 
group throughout the entire period, July 2001 through December 2016. Column 2 shortens the time frame of 
the  analysis  to  a  short  period  before  and  after  the  beginning  to  the  cartel,  that  is  January  2002  through 
December  2003.16  The  reason  for  decreasing  the  range  period  being  analyzed  was  to  avoid  capturing  any 
other shocks that might have taken place in the LPG distribution price besides the cartel in the post-treatment 
period. Columns 3 and 4 follow the same considerations as Columns 1 and 2, respectively, but only include 
São Paulo and Pernambuco in the control group.

16 Remembering that according to the evidence collected by CADE, the beginning of the cartel was dated in February 2003 and its 
dissolution was considered to have taken place in April 2005. Therefore, I chose to consider a period one year before its beginning 
and 10 months after. Columns 2 and 4 of the local common trend test does not consider the entire period of the cartel. 

16 

 

Based on the results for Column 1, we reject the null hypothesis at a 90% confidence level for the month of  
April 2003, but not at 95%. This seems to be saying that the price increase of the cartel started to pick up at 
around the month of April and not in February when the cartel was actually instated. Moreover, in the joint 
significance test for the months of December 2002 and March 2003, we do not reject the null hypothesis, β-
1= β-2=0, reinforcing the conclusions from the previous tests that there is in a common tendency between the 
treatment and control groups before the cartel shock. However, for the post treatment  joint significant test, 
β1= β2=0, we reject the null hypothesis, proving that there was in fact a shock in that period. 
 
The  joint  significance  tests  performed  for  the  data  in  Columns  2  and  4  showed  similar  results.  We  do  not 
reject  the  null  hypothesis  for  the  pre-treatment  period  at  a  5%  significance  level  but  reject  it  for  the  post-
treatment period. These results validate our common trend test. Given the two common trend test, our control 
group will be restricted to Pernambuco and São Paulo.  
 
The results for the difference-in-difference regression can be found in Table 4. We will focus on the results 
from  Columns  3  and  4,  which  includes  only  São  Paulo  and  Pernambuco  in  the  control  group.  Column  3 
included  the  data  from  the  period  between  July  2001  to  December  2016.  Its  output  shows  an  overprice  of 
16.96% in LPG distribution price during the cartel, awarding the cartel participants an extra gain of almost 
R$ 1.3 billion17.  
 
In Column  4 we restricted the period of the analysis  from  February 2002 to December 2003,  for  the same 
reason  we  did  in  the  local  common  tendency  test:  to  avoid  shocks  other  than  the  cartel  overprice  from 
influencing  our  results.  As  we  can  see  from  the  output  in  Column  4,  the  overprice  was  similar  to  that  in 
Column 3, however slightly smaller. The results indicated that the cartel was operating with prices 15.97% 
higher  than  it  would  have  in  perfect  competition,  amounting  to  over  R$  1.2  billion  in  undue  gains.18  It  is 
important to highlight that the price overcharge result in the model in which the control group included only 
Pernambuco and São Paulo was almost two and a half times larger than it was in the model including all four 
states  (6.76%). This  could  indicate  that there  probably  were  other  shocks  influencing  the  LPG  distribution 
prices in the two states we excluded from the analysis.   
 
As  we  can  see  from  the  results,  the  price  overcharge  calculated  by  the  difference-in-difference  method 
utilizing a more restricted and scrutinized control group gave us a value much larger than what was estimated 
by Ms. Alkmin in her calculations for the CADE. However, it was consistent with the conclusions arrived by 
Connor and Lande in their study in which they calculated the modal average overcharges in between 10 to 20 
percent. This shows how the difference-in-difference model can be sensitive to the choice of a control group; 
restricting the control group may have a significant influence on the results. 
 

                                                
17 The formulas used to arrive at the damages and price overcharge in percentage were, respectively: ߚଷ ∑ ܳ௜
was the average LPG distribution price in January 2003. 
18 Updating the damages up to December 2016 using the IPCA, we arrive at damages amount in between R$ 2.2 to R$ 2.4 billions.

Conclusion 
 
Quantifying cartel damages has been gaining momentum among antitrust authorities around the world, Brazil 
included.  Even  though  there  have  been  major  discussions  on  the  role  of  a  competition  agency,  more 
specifically on whether it has jurisdiction to calculate estimated damages or not, it seems that more and more 
agencies  been bringing  it upon them to do so.  Given the several different  methodologies available for that 
purpose, analysts face the difficult task of choosing the most appropriate approach for calculation while at the 
same time finding balance between accuracy and practicality. As discussed along this paper, some methods 
are able to return more accurate results but they also require more data and assumptions and are much more 
time  consuming.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  other  methods,  such  as  before  and  after  approaches  and 
difference-in-difference methods, used in this paper to estimate damages, that are more practical and less data 
intensive but gives less accurate results.     
  
The objective of this paper was to select among the existing methods, one that could give us accurate results 
in  a timely  manner. The Multivariate Before and After  method indicated an overcharge of  between 10% to 
13% in the distribution prices of LPG in Pará. The difference-in-difference model estimated an overcharge of 
something in between 15.97% to 16.96%. These results are consistent with the study performed by  Connor 
and  Lande  (2008)  where  they  calculated  the  mode  of  overcharges  in  between  10  to  20  percent.  Also,  the 
results  obtained  in  our  study  were  higher  than  the    one  obtained  by  Ms.  Alkmin  in  her  difference-in-
difference application: 4% to 8.2%.

Even  though  the  results  from  this  study  seem  to  be  consistent  with  average  overcharges  found  in  the 
academic  literature  and  with  the  results  calculated  by  CADE,  there  are  always  improvements  that  can  be 
made  to  refine  the  calculations  even  further.  First,  we  could  adopt  the  synthetic  control  method  in  the 
difference-in-difference  estimation  to  improve  the  results.  The  synthetic  control  method  builds  on  the 
difference-in-difference model to evaluate the causal effects of shocks. It makes two essential changes to the 
model:  i)  it  allows  for  time-varying  individual-specific  heterogeneity;  and  ii)  takes  a  serious,  data  driven 
approach to forming counterfactuals. It basically uses longitudinal data to build a weighted average of non-
treated units that best reproduces the characteristics of the treated unit over time, prior to the treatment.19 This 
approach relaxes the previous hypothesis that the benchmark market should not be affected by the shock and 
that there must be a common tendency between the treatment and control groups in the pre-treatment period. 
Therefore, it allows us to forgo the common tendency tests that were performed in this study. However, like 
all other methods, it comes at a cost: its computational time far exceeds that of the difference-in-difference 
estimation, leading us back to the practicality versus accuracy issue.   
  
In  addition,  it  would  be  important  that  in  future  studies  we  find  available  data  on  cost  shifters,  mainly 
transportation costs, so to enable us to calculate the deadweight loss using the structural models. This would 
allow for the construction of a supply and demand structural model that could potentially calculate the impact 
of the total loss of welfare to society. Although it requires a large data base, it is the model that best simulates 
the "real world".
