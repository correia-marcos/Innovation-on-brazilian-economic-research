Abstract  

Governments devote considerable resources on reducing the incidence of low birth weight with the reasoning 
that low birth weight is the cause of poor infant health. Much of what we know on the causal link between 
these variables comes from developed countries. However, these estimates may have limited external validity 
to the developing world if families with more resources are better able to remediate the effects of poor neonatal 
health or if there are non-linearities in the production function for child health. In this article, we estimate the 
relationship  between  birth  weight  and  infant  mortality  using  data  from  Brazil.  Using  a  within-twin 
identification strategy, we document that lower birth weight babies exhibit higher rates of mortality within one 
year of birth. The effects are much larger than those derived from the US and Norwegian context. We also find 
that the effects  are  largely  reduced  when local  sanitation coverage is  high, suggesting that access  to  public 
health infrastructure may mitigate the consequences of low birth weight.

Resumo 

Os governos gastam muitos recursos na redução da incidência do baixo peso ao nascer com o raciocínio de que 
o baixo peso ao nascer é a causa de uma saúde infantil deficiente. Muito do que é conhecido sobre a relação 
causal entre estas variáveis vem de estudos para países desenvolvidos. Contudo, estas estimativas poderiam ter 
pouca  validez  externa  para  países  em  desenvolvimento  se  famílias  com  mais  recursos  são  mais  capazes  de 
remediar os efeitos de más condições de saúde neonatal ou se há não-linearidades na função de produção de 
saúde infantil. Neste artigo, estima-se a relação entre baixo peso ao nascer e mortalidade infantil usando dados 
do  Brasil.  Usando  uma  estratégia  de  efeitos  fixos  de  gêmeos,  encontra-se  que  mais  baixo  peso  ao  nascer 
aumenta  a  probabilidade  de  morrer  no  primeiro  ano  de  vida.  Este  efeito  é  muito  maior  em  comparação  ao 
encontrado  para  os  Estados  Unidos  e  a  Noruega.  Também  encontra-se  que  os  efeitos  são  mais  baixos  nas 
regiões que tem maior cobertura da saneamento, o qual indica que acesso a  infraestrutura pública de saúde 
poderia mitigar as consequências do baixo peso ao nascer.

1.  Introduction  

It has been widely believed that malnutrition in utero, commonly proxied by low birth weight, is an important 
contributor  to  poor  infant  health.1  As  a  result,  governments  and  international  agencies  have  devoted 
considerable resources on preventing low birth weight. In India, for example, the World Bank allocated over 
US$100 million for a program aimed at cutting in half the incidence of low birth weight.2 Preventing low birth 
weight  has  been  also  a  major  motivation  for  nutritional  programs  and  maternal  smoking  campaigns 
worldwide.3 The strong and well-documented association between low birth weight and infant health has led 
to the position that the social returns of these investments are large. Numerous studies indicate that low birth 
weight babies have increased risk of death within one year of birth, and that who survive infancy are likely to 
suffer from a number of health and developmental difficulties, some of which are known to negatively affect 
acquisition of human capital.4 Understanding whether low birth weight is in fact the cause of poor infant health 
and not simply a correlate of such problems is crucial for guiding the targeting of policies intended to reduce 
inequalities by improving early life health.  

The challenges with uncovering the causal effect of birth weight are well known in the literature. A strong 
correlation between low birth weight and infant health may be the product of unobserved factors because the 
determinants of nutrition during pregnancy, including family background and parent’s knowledge about health 
care, are also likely determinants of infant health. So any attempt to ascertain the importance of birth weight 
for infant health by simply looking at their correlation, or equivalently estimating a simple ordinary least square 
(OLS) regression, is unlikely to provide convincing evidence. Studies within economics have overcome these 
challenges  using  rich  data  from  the  United  States  and  Norway,  and  within-twin  identification  strategies 
(ALMOND; CHAY; LEE, 2005; BLACK; DEVEREUX; SALVANES, 2007; OREOPOULOS et al., 2008). 
These studies suggest that low birth weight leads to increased risk of mortality, although the effects are much 
smaller than those derived from cross-sectional regressions. This body of research even suggests that low birth 
can have long-lasting effects on human capital accumulation, which in turn has been interpreted as evidence 
consistent with the literature emphasizing that early health conditions are a major determinant of individual 
capabilities.5  For  example,  Figlio  et  al.  (2014)  illustrate  that  birth  weight  has  negative  effects  on  cognitive 
development,  while  that  Black,  Devereux,  and  Salvanes  (2007)  show  that  low  birth  weight  babies  exhibit 
reduced earnings, lower educational attainment, and worse health outcomes  as adults.  

While  these  studies  have  undoubtedly  advanced  our  understanding  of  the  effect  of  birth  weight  on  infant 
welfare, we know fairly little about  this relationship in developing countries. As emphasized by Currie and  
Vogl  (2013),  research  on  the  consequences  of  early  health  insults  has  much  policy  relevance  in  poorer 
countries, but precisely measured birth weight data are rare in large sample surveys from these countries. Thus, 
it  is  very  little  known  about  whether  the  effects  of  birth  weight  vary  at  different  economic  development 
contexts. In the absence of a well-functioning public health system and the presence financial constraints, the 
capacity to remediate health shocks may be simply more limited in poor countries, which would imply that 
birth weight might have a larger overall health impact in these economies. Moreover, one may observe different 
effects if there are non-linearities in the production function for child health or if there are interactions between 

                                                           
1 Low birth weight is conventionally defined as a birth weight less than 2,500 grams.  
2This is the Second Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Project. The program also had other goals, such as improving nutrition and 
health status of children0-72 months (THE WORLD BANK, 1998).  
3 In the United States, for example, a motivation for the Medicaid expansion to pregnant women was the reduction of the incidence 
of low birth weight (CURRIE; GRUBER, 1996).  
4 Previous studies have shown, for example, that low birth weight is associated with health problems such as cerebral palsy, deafness, 
epilepsy, blindness, asthma, and lung disease (BROOKS et al., 2001; KAELBER; PUGH, 1969; LUCAS; MORLEY; COLE, 1998; 
MATTE et al., 2001). 
5 See Conti and Heckman (2010), Cunha, Heckman and Schennach (2010), Cunha, and Heckman (2007, 2008, 2009) for a theoretical 
discussion about the role of early health conditions in the accumulation of human capital. 

birth weight and environmental factors (ALMOND; MAZUMDER, 2013; YI et al., 2015). In consequence, 
estimates derived from rich countries may not be externally valid to the developing country context.  

Many of the existing studies for developing countries are in the epidemiological literature. These studies has 
relied  on  cross-sectional  estimates  while  controlling  for  parents’  background  characteristics.  However,  this 
empirical strategy might be subject to omitted variable bias from unobserved factors that can affect both birth 
weight  and  infant  health.  Furthermore,  these  studies  are  generally  based  on  small  and  non-representative 
samples,  making  it  the  results  difficult  to  generalize  and  limiting  the  development  of  clear  stylized  facts. 
Remarkably, research in the economic literature that aims to have a more causal and general interpretation of 
the relationship between birth weight and infant health in a developing country context is rare. To the best of 
our knowledge, only McGovern (2014) investigates the effects of birth weight on infant health in developing 
countries. He uses data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), which is conducted in more than 
90 countries worldwide. However, the use of self-reported information on birth weight is likely to suffer from 
measurement error that may not be random. Most people in developing country rural areas, especially in sub-
Saharan Africa, do not give births in hospitals, so birth weight is likely to be badly measured. Moreover, the 
use of these surveys does not allow excluding twin pairs with congenital defects and Almond, Chay and Lee 
(2005) show that it can lead to severe bias.   

In this paper, we provide estimates of the effect of birth weight on infant mortality using administrative data 
on the universe of births linked to death records in Brazil. As we describe in more detail in section 2.2, these 
matched data provide comprehensive information on birth weight, congenital defects, date and cause of death, 
and mother’s background characteristics. With these rich data, we follow 19 million singletons and 300,000 
pairs of twins from birth through the first year of life. The enormous sample size from this dataset gives us a 
strong statistical power to discern patterns. For identification, we take advantage of quasi-random variation in 
birth weight within twin pairs, as described in section 2.1. Using precisely  measured birth weight data in  a 
large nationally representative sample and a within-twin identification strategy, we provide what we believe is 
the most credible evidence on the causal effect of birth weight on infant health in a developing country context.  

We document that lower birth weight babies exhibit higher rates of mortality within one  year of birth.  Our 
estimates imply that very low birth  weight  babies have  4 percentage points  higher risk of death  within one 
year. The mortality effects are concentrated on conditions originating in the perinatal period, which include 
respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period, and hematological disorders of fetus 
and  newborn.  In  line  with  earlier  studies  for  developed  countries,  the  cross-sectional  estimates  tend  be 
substantially larger in magnitude than the ones derived from the twin-fixed effects estimator. This confirms 
that policy designs based on cross-sectional estimates may exaggerate the benefits of reducing the incidence 
of low birth weight.   

We then compare our estimates to those derived in the US and Norway. Specifically, we compare our estimates 
to Almond, Chay, and Lee (2005) and Black, Devereux and Salvanes  (2007). In general, our estimates are 
larger in magnitude than those derived from these studies. The differences are substantial. For example, our 
estimates  are  about  two  times  larger  than  those  reported  by  Almond,  Chay,  and  Lee  (2005)  for  the  United 
States. We argue that these results cannot be explained by specific features of our empirical setting, such as 
measurement error and the possibility of selection bias induced by miscarriage or stillbirth. A more plausible 
interpretation  of  these  results  is  that  developing  and  developed  countries  have  a  very  different  causal 
relationship between birth weight and infant mortality. Although it is difficult to make causal claims on the 
specific reasons behind these differences, we assess whether related explanations that are more common to 
developing countries, such as low parental education, might be plausible candidates. Our results indicate that 
the effects of birth weight are stronger for infants born to mothers who have low educational attainment and 
are unmarried. The effects generally increase by 5 to 71 percent relative to infants born to more advantaged 

families. We also find that the effects of birth weight are smaller for families residing in municipalities with 
sanitation coverage over 85 percent. For these families, the impacts falls by 41 to 83 percent, which suggests 
that birth weight may be interacting with environmental factors. Taken together, we conclude tentatively that 
applying  estimates  that are derived  from  the US  or Norway to  developing countries may be misleading for 
cost-benefit assessments of policy.  

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe our estimation strategy and the 
data used. Section 3 presents our main results, including robustness checks and a comparison of our estimates 
to those derived in the US and Norwegian setting. Section 4 explores different forms of heterogeneity in the 
impacts of birth weight on infant mortality. Finally, section 5 concludes.   

2.  Empirical Approach and Data  

2.1. Identification strategy 

The goal of the empirical analysis is to estimate the effect of birth weight on infant death. Following Almond 
and Lee (2005) and Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007), let:  

𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑏𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝑥𝑗𝑡

′ 𝛿 + 𝜇𝑗𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡           (1)                

The variable 𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ is the probability of death within one year of life of the infant i born to mother j in year t. 
The variable bw is birth weight; 𝑥 is a vector of mother’s characteristics, including education, age at birth and 
marital status; 𝜇𝑗𝑡 is a set of unobservable that are mother- and birth-specific, such as family background, the 
quality  of  prenatal,  genetic  factors,  and  mother’s  knowledge  or  awareness  about  health  care;  and  𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡  is  an 
idiosyncratic error term assumed orthogonal to other terms in the equation.   

The parameter of interest for policy is 𝛽. If it is negative and large in magnitude, then targeting interventions 
during the in utero period to prevent low birth weight may yield high returns. OLS estimates of the equation 
(1) that ignore 𝜇𝑗𝑡 will be likely biased because many factors in 𝜇𝑗𝑡 are also determinants of birth weight. For 
example, the quality of parent’s education is likely to affect both prenatal and postnatal investments. Therefore, 
any OLS estimate of 𝛽 would need to be a combination of omitted variable bias and the causal effect of birth 
weight. To isolate the effect of birth weight from unobservable factors, we use a twin-fixed effects estimator. 
This approach compares the probability of death of twin i to twin k, who were born to the same mother but had 
different levels of birth weight. Including twin-fixed effects is equivalent to estimating the following equation:  

 𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ1𝑗𝑡 − 𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ2𝑗𝑡 = 𝛽(𝑏𝑤1𝑗𝑡 − 𝑏𝑤2𝑗𝑡) + (𝜀1𝑗𝑡 − 𝜀2𝑗𝑡)           (2)                

Where “1” refers to the first-born twin and “2” refers to the second-born twin. Note that the use of the equation 
(2) will produce consistent estimates since the mother- and birth specific component is differenced out and 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 
is assumed independent of birth weight. To see this, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which 
nearly all twin pairs differ in the birth weights. As discussed by Almond and Lee (2005) and Black, Devereux, 
and  Salvanes  (2007),  the  differences  in  birth  weight  could  be  the  result  of  differences  in  nutritional  intake 
induced by different umbilical cord insertion points within the placenta and different positions in the womb 
(PHILLIPS,  1993;  ZHANG;  BRENNER;  KLEBANOFF,  2001).  As  parental  control  over  these  factors  is 
limited,  it  becomes  plausible  the  identifying  assumption  that  within-twin  differences  in  birth  weight  are 
exogenous.       

Our main  results  are  based on the equation (2).  To account  for  gender differences in  birth weight,  we  also 
include an indicator variable of infant’s sex as a control in all regressions. There is no a priori justification for 
using a determined functional form. We compare the explanatory power of specifications that use either birth 
weight, log(birth weight), and a set of dummy variables for discrete birth weight categories (i.e, 1,500, 1,500-
2,500 and 2,500-3,000 grams). This exercise reveals that the specification using dummy variables provides the 
best fit. Therefore, we use these birth weight categories as the independent variables of interest in our analysis.  

2.2.Data 

Our empirical analysis requires data on birth weight and infant mortality. We use microdata from the Brazilian 
National System of Information on Birth Records (SINASC) and the National System of Mortality Records 
(SIM). The SINASC provides information on all births in Brazil since 1994, although it did not cover most of 
the municipalities before 1998. The data includes the exact date of birth, weeks of gestation, sex, birth weight, 
and  maternal  characteristics  such  as  marital  status,  age  and  education.  The  death  certificates  from  the  SIM 
provide  comprehensive  information  on  date  and  cause  of  death,  birthdate,  race,  and  gender,  and  mother’s 
characteristics (education, marital status and age) are also provided for individuals who were under one year 
of life at death. Municipal governments are responsible for collecting all death certificates and sending them 
to  the Health Ministry  of the Government of  Brazil, which  consolidates  finally the information  in  the SIM 
database. The laws governing the collection of the death certificates are national and no burial can be performed 
without a death certificate. The SIM covers over 96 percent of all annual deaths inferred from demographic 
census.6   

We linked death certificate information for the infants who die in their first year of life to the SINASC database 
by  using  unique  personal  identifiers  provided  by  the  Health  Ministry.  The  unique  personal  identifiers  are 
available for births occurring from 2006 through 2012. During this period, there were 20,265,131 births, of 
which 1.9 percent were twins. The matching rates are nearly constant across time and States. About 70 percent 
of the infant death records are matched to one of the birth records. The matching rate is not 100 percent because 
the unique personal identifiers are missing for some infants in the death records. The matching rate is notably 
higher for twin births, approximately 80 percent. This is reassuring because our main analysis relies on the 
sample composed by twins. The fact that some infant deaths are not matched to the birth certificate records 
will introduce measurement error in our dependent variable. We discuss the implications of this issue in section 
3.2.    

Since the  unique personal  identifiers allow only  identifying individual births,  infants  who were born to  the 
same mother cannot be directly inferred. We exploit the fact that multiple birth records are generally located 
next to each other in birth certificate files to construct twin-pairs codes. First, we identified all these adjacent 
twin  pairs  in  our  data.  Second,  we  consider  that  a  given  adjacent  twin  pair  is  part  of  the  same  twin  set  if 
pregnancy  characteristics are identical.  Specifically,  adjacent  twin  pairs  are considered as born in  the same 
mother if they have identical information for the following set of covariates:  hospital of birth, exact date of 
birth, gestational age, mother’s age, mother’s education, mother’s marital status, and municipality of residence. 
Approximately  90  percent  of  the  308,010  adjacent  twin  pair  records  have  identical  information  for  these 
variables. We restrict the sample to these twin births, although the results are extremely similar when used all 
adjacent twin pair records.  

                                                           
6 Information on coverage of the deaths from SIM are available at http://tabnet.datasus.gov.br/cgi/sim/dados/cid10_indice.htm.  

In total, there are 276,268 twin births in our sample. We exclude twin pairs where either twin was born with a 
congenital  defect  (about  7  percent),  as  differences  in  birth  weight  that  are  driven  by  this  condition  may 
introduce  bias.  Twin  pairs  where  either  twin  had  missing  information  about  sex  or  birth  weight  are  also 
excluded  from  the  analysis.  This  restriction  results  in  dropping  about  0.1  percent  of  the  sample.  Our  final 
sample consists of 255,362 twin births. While our main analysis focuses on the twin sample, we also present 
results  for  singletons.  There  are  18,929,949  singletons  with  non-missing  information  for  birth  weight  and 
infant’s sex.  

Table 1 presents basic descriptive statistics splitting the sample between twins and singletons.  It is apparent 
that there is differences between the two populations. Indeed, twins are more likely to be born with a weight 
less than 2,500 grams, have higher rates of prematurity, and are more likely to die within one year of birth than 
singletons. The differences are large. For example, the probability of dying in the first year is 4.5 times higher 
for twins than for singletons.  These differences also suggest a negative relationship between birth weight and 
infant mortality. Since low birth weight is also the result of prematurity, it is difficult to establish in principle 
from these cross-sectional comparisons either whether birth weight or prematurity is the responsible for the 
increased rates of infant mortality  among twins. As Table 1 shows, there are also substantive differences in 
mother’s characteristics between the two groups. In general, twinning probabilities seem to be higher among 
advantaged families. Indeed, mother of twins are more likely to be older, more educated and more likely to be 
married. It is well known that the use of fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization pre-embryo transfer, 
can increase the likelihood of multiple births.7 Since these treatments are costly or provided by private health 
insurance, families with more resources may be more likely to use them and consequently parents’ background 
characteristics could be systematically related to the incidence of twin births.8 This fact calls into question the 
external  validity  of  the  analysis  from  twins.  Despite  these  dissimilarities  between  the  two  populations,  we 
provide  suggestive  evidence  that  the  results  from  twins  may  be  generalizable  to  the  general  population.  In 
particular, we show that the pooled cross-sectional estimates for the twin population are remarkably similar 
with that for the singleton population.      

Because our statistical approach relies on within-twin variation, we confirm that there is substantial within-
twin variability in birth weight and mortality outcomes. Table 2 and Figure 2 show the distribution of the twin 
birth weight-difference. The mean birth weight difference is 276 grams, or 11 percent of the average twin’s 
birth weight. The data also indicate that 60 percent of twin pairs exhibit a birth weight difference higher than 
260 grams, and 10 percent have a birth weight difference higher than 600 grams. In Table 3, which reports 
mean squared errors from regressions with either birth weight or mortality outcomes as dependent variables, 
we explore in more detail the sources of the variation in both outcomes.  Columns (2) reveals that gestational 
age explains over half of the overall variance in birth weight. This is consistent with prior literature indicating 
that  gestation  length  plays  a  critical  role  in  intrauterine  growth  (KRAMER,  1987).  Despite  the  significant 
contribution  of  gestation  length  to  variation  in  birth  weight,  there  are  great  deal  of  variation  that  is  due  to 
within-twin differences. Indeed, column (3) shows that 20 percent of differences of the birth weight variation 
due to differential fetal growth rates is due to within-twin differences. This wide variation is the basis of our 
identification strategy.

8  Ponczek  and  Souza  (2012)  provide  a  comprehensive  discussion  about  the  relationship  between  fertility  treatments,  twinning 
probabilities and parents’ background characteristics in Brazil. They also show that mother of twins are more educated.  

3.  Results    

3.1. Main results and robustness checks  

Table 4 shows estimates of the effect of birth weight on four mortality outcomes: one-year mortality, neonatal 
mortality,  seven-day  mortality  and  one-day  mortality.  Each  panel  reports  results  for  different  sample  and 
estimation techniques. In Panel A, we use the sample of singletons and estimate OLS regressions. Pooled OLS 
estimates for the sample of twins are presented in Panel B. Finally, our preferred results are presented in Panel 
C, where we use the twin-fixed effects strategy. All regressions include control for infant’s sex. The sample 
sizes and R2’s of the regressions are shown at the bottom of each panel. All standard errors are robust against 
arbitrary heteroscedasticity, and allow for clustering at the twin-pair level when the sample of twins is used.      

The pooled OLS estimates using the singleton sample suggest strong and negative effects of birth weight on 
infant mortality. The probability of dying within one year of birth of a baby weighting less than 1,500 grams 
is as much as 31 percentage points higher than that of babies weighting 3,000 grams or more. Relative to a 
sample average probability of one-year mortality of 34 percent for infants with birth weight less than 1,500, 
the effect  is  substantial  at  91 percent.  For the 1,500-2,500  grams birth weight  category  the  effect falls to  2 
percentage  points,  but  remains  significant.  These  estimated  coefficients  are  quite  similar  in  magnitude  for 
neonatal mortality. This suggests that the cross-sectional relationship between birth weight and infant mortality 
is driven largely by deaths that occur within 28 days of birth. When we use pooled OLS in the sample of twins, 
we find a similar pattern. Importantly, the estimated coefficients are also similar in magnitude for twins than 
for singletons, which suggests that both populations are subject to the same relationship between birth weight 
and infant mortality. This provides reassuring evidence that the results from twins may be generalizable to the 
general population. Overall, these findings confirm the strong cross-sectional relationship between birth weight 
and infant mortality found in earlier studies for developed countries.     

In  direct  contrast  to  the  cross-sectional  estimates,  the  twin-fixed  effects  estimator  suggests  much  smaller 
impacts. For infants born with very low weight (less than 1,500 grams), there are about 4 percentage points 
higher risk of death within one year. This estimated effect is only one sixth the size of the OLS coefficient. 
Similarly, when we look at the other mortality measures, we find much smaller impacts. The effect of very low 
birth weight falls from 23 to 3 percentage points for neonatal mortality, from 19 to 1.8 percentage points for 
seven mortality, and falls from 12 to 0.3 percentage points for one-day mortality. In sum, the estimated effect 
of very low birth weight falls by a factor of 6 to 40. Despite the estimates fall notably when family unobserved 
characteristics are accounted for, they remain statistically significant, with exception of one-day mortality. The 
fact that twin-fixed effects estimates are much smaller suggests that there is a prima facie case for a severe 
omitted variable bias in the cross-sectional regressions.   

Since our sample includes both fraternal and monozygotic twins, one might be even worried if discordance in 
birth weight between twins are related to these genetic conditions. This type of caveat is recurrently mentioned 
in  the  literature  that  uses  within-twin  identification  strategies.  Still,  these  studies  tend  to  find  quite  similar 
results  when  their  samples  are  restricted  to  same-sex  twin  pairs,  which  clearly  contain  a  larger  fraction  of 
identical twin births. In fact, Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007) are able to observe directly zigosity in a 
sub-set of twins and find identical results. The robustness of the findings in such sub-samples suggests that the 
bias generated by zygosity is, at best, small in practice. We perform the same robustness check by estimating 
the  birth  weight  effects  in  a  sub-sample  that  includes  only  same-sex  twin  pairs.  As  shown  in  Table  5,  the 
estimates are similar to the baseline ones, indicating that zygosity is not affecting our estimates.   

The enormous sample size we have at our disposal allows us to explore the relationship between birth weight 
and infant mortality by cause. We group our sample into four categories: conditions originating in the perinatal 

period,  infectious  and  parasitic  diseases,  diseases  of  the  respiratory  system,  and  all  other  diagnoses.  These 
results  are  presented  in  Table  6  using  our  preferred  estimation  technique,  namely  the  twin-fixed  effects 
estimator. The results show no robust evidence of a birth weight effect on mortality by infectious, parasitic, or 
respiratory causes.  Furthermore,  we find small  estimates  that are  tightly bound around zero, indicating that 
birth weight does not have any discernible effects on these causes of death. In contrast, the results indicate that 
the birth weight effects are driven by deaths from conditions originating in the perinatal period, which include 
respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period, hematological disorders of fetus and 
newborn,  and  disorders  related  to  low  birth  weight.  This  is  perhaps  unsurprisingly  because  some  of  these 
disorders are directly diagnosed based on baby’s birth weight.        

While the functional form used allows for non-linear effects, it may not completely capture the relationship 
between  birth  weight  and  infant  mortality  if  there  is  specific  effects  at  other  birth  weight  categories.  For 
example, the effects of birth weight may be  particularly higher among infants with a birth weight  less than 
1,000  grams.  Next,  we  use  a  specification  that  allows  the  effects  of  birth  weight  to  be  more  flexible. 
Specifically, we estimate models given by:         

𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼 + ∑ 𝐷𝑖𝑗𝑡

𝑘

𝑘 𝛽𝑘

+ 𝑥𝑗𝑡

′ 𝛿 + 𝜇𝑗𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡            (3)                 

𝑘  is a dummy variable that indicates if the birth weight of an infant is in the kth bin. We use 27 dummy 
where 𝐷𝑖𝑗𝑡
variables corresponding to 100 gram-wide birth weight bins of the distribution of birth weight below 3,000 
grams. The bins range from a low of 300-400 grams to a high of 2,900-3,000 grams. The omitted category is 
birth weight of 3,000 grams or more. We estimate these regressions using both OLS and twin-fixed effects. 
The results from this more flexible functional form are presented in Figure 3, which plots the coefficients from 
these  weight-bins.  In  general,  there  appears  to  be  a  concave  relationship  between  birth  weight  and  infant 
mortality, indicating that reductions in birth weight are more detrimental at lower levels of birth weight. The 
effects tend to disappear when the birth weight is over 1,800 grams. The results also make clearer the severe 
omitted variable bias in the OLS regressions.  Consider, for example, the cross-sectional results for one-day 
mortality. They indicate that infants who are born with a weight below 300 grams are 40 percentage points 
more  likely  to  die  within  one  day  of  birth.  In  contrast,  the  twin-fixed  effects  results  suggest  a  statistically 
insignificant  impact  of  about  1  percentage  point.  In  general,  the  twin-fixed  effects  estimates  are  never 
significant for one-day mortality, with estimated coefficients tightly bound around zero.  

Table 7 explores further alternative specifications of the relationship between birth weight and infant mortality. 
Panel A shows results using birth weight (in grams) as the primary variable of interest, while that Panel B uses 
the log of birth weight.  In general, our results are qualitatively similar  using these variables.  Our  estimates 
from Panel A imply that a 50 grams increase in birth weight would reduce one-year mortality by one death per 
1,000 births. Since infant mortality is a rare event, estimates may be sensitive to functional form. Panels C and 
D  estimate  logit  models  with  twin-fixed  effects.  Using  this  functional  form,  we  find  results  qualitatively 
similar, but the marginal effects tend to be higher. For example, the coefficient of -0.002 in Panel C implies 
that a 50 grams increase in birth weight would reduce one-year mortality by three deaths per 1,000 births. This 
is perhaps unsurprising given that logit models only includes cases in which one twin lives and one twin dies, 
which may change the composition of the sample.   

Next, we replace our measure of infant health with other common measure of infant welfare, namely APGAR 
scores. This is a clinical test that is given to the newborn in which five parameters are assessed. These include 
muscle tone, respiratory effort, heart rate, reflexes and skin color. The test provides a total score between 0 and 
10,  where  a  higher  score  means  “healthier”.  The  results  in  Table  8  suggests  one  strong  cross-sectional 
relationship between birth weight and APGAR scores. Very low birth weight babies are 33 percentage points 

more likely to have a low 5-minute APGAR score (less than 8). This estimated effect falls by a factor of 13 
when twin-fixed effects are included, although it remains statistically significant.   

3.2. Selective mortality and measurement error 

As our analysis is based on live births, a bias could arise if a disproportioned number of the marginal fetus that 
survive are in the low end of the birth weight distribution. That is, if weak fetuses with potentially low birth 
weight are less likely to be born alive, then our results would be based on a select sample of surviving (and 
presumably stronger) births. However, note that the use of this select sample most likely will bias our estimates 
of the effect of birth weight on infant mortality towards zero. Therefore, we are less concerned about selection 
bias  from  selective  miscarriage  or  stillbirth.  As  such,  in  the  presence  of  this  bias,  our  estimates  should  be 
viewed as lower bounds of the true effect of birth weight on infant mortality.  

Another potential concern with our results is measurement error in health outcomes. As we mentioned earlier, 
some certificate death records were not matched to one of the birth records, which implies that infant mortality 
is  measured  with  error  for  some  infants.  If  the  measurement  error  is  random  then  the  consistency  and 
unbiasedness  of  our  estimates  would  be  unaffected.  Alternatively,  if  birth  weight  covaries  with  the 
measurement error, then our estimates would be biased. In Appendix A, we describe in full detail a simple test 
that measures the extent to which this measurement error may affect our estimates. In particular, the test takes 
advantage  of the fact  that  the measurement error  is  observable in  the  certificate death  records and  we have 
information about birth weight for all these births. Thus, the within-twin correlation between the measurement 
error (or equivalently the likelihood of being matched to birth files) and the birth weight of the infants would 
be a simple test for this potential bias. Since we are unable to identify twin pairs who were born to the same 
mother in the death records, the within-twin correlation cannot estimated, but the overall correlation  would 
provide useful information if it goes in the same direction and magnitude. The data indicate that a 200 grams 
increase in birth weight is associated with a decrease of 0.8 percentage point in the likelihood of being matched. 
While significant at the 5 percent level, this estimate is small in magnitude, with an implied elasticity of only 
-0.05. Assuming that the within-twin covariance is smaller than overall covariance between the probability of 
being matched to certificate birth records and birth weight, then the resulting bias is unlikely to be relevant in 
practice. 9    

3.3.Comparison to existing studies for developed countries 

A natural question is whether estimates derived from developed countries are externally valid to the developing 
world. If the access to medical care is more limited in developing countries or if there are interactions between 
birth weight and infant mortality, the estimates derived from the US or Norway may not valid in conducting 
cost-benefit analysis of public health policies in developing countries. As we discussed in the Introduction, the 
presence of these potential factors likely imply an underestimating of the benefits of such policies.   

We compare our estimates to those from Almond and Lee (2005) and Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007) 
in Table 9. Panel A presents our estimates for infant mortality. We present estimates that use either birth weight 
or  log  of  birth  weight  as  independent  variables  in  order  to  make  our  results  comparable  to  these  previous 
studies. Panel B provides twin-fixed effects estimates for the papers in the US and Norway setting. The means 
of infant mortality and birth weight are also provided for ease of interpretation.      

We find that a 50 grams increase in birth weight would reduce one-year mortality by one death per 1,000 births. 
Given  the  mean  rate  of  36.88,  this  implies  that  a  1  percent  increases  in  birth  weight  leads  to  a  1.6  percent 

                                                           
9 This seems a plausible assumption since it is difficult to think of reasons why, in a given twin pair, one twin has a non-missing 
unique personal identifier and not the other. In this case, the twin-specific component of the measurement error will tend to zero.      

reduction in infant mortality. Thus, we find a much larger effect on the infant mortality rate than either Almond 
and Lee (2005) or Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007). The estimated elasticity for the US is -0.51, and for 
Norway is about -0.83. Given the discussion in section 3.2, it is clear that these results cannot be explained by 
bias from selective mortality or measurement error in mortality outcomes. Thus, a tentative conclusion is that 
estimates derived from the developed world are not generalizable to poor countries.   

4.  Heterogeneity  

While it is beyond the scope of this study to understand why the causal effect of birth weight differ between 
developing and developed countries, we can assess whether the effects vary heterogeneously across different 
dimensions  to  provide  tentative  evidence  of  possible  explanations.  Furthermore,  learning  whether  there  are 
significant  interactions  also  offers  evidence  about  specific  channels  linking  birth  weight  and  mortality 
outcomes, as well as about possible policy prescriptions that may act to mitigate the consequences of low birth 
weight.  Brazil  provides  a  compelling  setting  for  these  purposes  because  it  has  a  large,  demographically 
heterogeneous, and socio-economically diverse population.  

We look at two potential factors. First, the effects of low birth weight may depend on household behavior and 
it  in  turn  might  vary  with  family  disadvantage.  Parents  with  more  resources  may  be  simply  better  able  to 
remediate  the  health  consequences  of  low  birth  weight.  As  poorer  families  are  more  likely  to  be  credit 
constraint, the use of important health services may be more limited. Moreover, neonatal health and parental 
inputs may be complements in the production function for child quality either because richer families are more 
likely to adopt compensating health investments or because the investments richer families make have higher 
returns.  Second,  one  might  expect  the  effects  of  birth  weight  to  vary  with  economic  development  due  to 
differences  in  access  to  public  health  infrastructure.  For  instance,  it  is  well-known  that  widespread  open 
defecation that does not make use of a toilet is one leading cause of infant mortality in developing countries. 
Thus, low birth weight babies in poor regions are potentially at higher risk of death partly because they are 
more exposed to unhealthy environments.  

We  begin  by  exploring  whether  the  impacts  of  birth  weight  vary  with  family  disadvantage.  As  family 
disadvantage is unobservable, we proxy it by maternal education and marital status at the time of birth. In this 
case,  family  disadvantage  should  be  view  as  differences  in  the  quality  and  quantity  of  available  household 
resources, including child-rearing inputs and parental attention (AUTOR et al., 2016). In Table 10, we estimate 
our preferred model separately for less- and more-educated mothers, and for married and unmarried mothers. 
The results for these separate regressions replicate qualitatively the pattern found before. The coefficients for 
infants born to married and more-educated mothers tend to be smaller. The decline in the estimates ranges from 
5 percent to nearly 71 percent. The cross-equation tests of coefficients reject that the coefficients are the same. 
These results are consistent with the notion that the health effects of low birth weight vary proportionally with 
family disadvantage.       

In Table 11, we assess whether the birth weights impacts vary with economic development. To that end, we 
first  divide  the  sample  according  to  the  quintile  of  the  municipal  GDP  and  then  we  estimate  regressions 
separately  for  each  group.  In  general,  the  effects  tend  to  be  smaller  for  infants  born  in  municipalities  with 
higher economic development. The falls in the estimates are striking, ranging from 41 to 83 percent. The tests 
for equality of coefficients generally reject the null hypothesis that they are the same. Analogously, in panel 
B, we divide the sample by level of sanitation coverage and estimate regressions separately for each group. 

The  results  indicate  that  higher  access  to  sanitation  is  associated  with  smaller  health  impacts  of  low  birth 
weight. Again, the differences in the estimates tend to be large and statistically significant.  

Overall, these results confirm that the effects of birth weight interact with family disadvantage and economic 
development. To disentangle the relative importance of both dimensions, we estimate our basic regression with 
twin fixed effects including interactions between the discrete birth weight categories and mother’s education, 
marital  status,  sanitation  coverage  and  GDP.  We  do  so  in  Table  12.  Column  (1)  replicates  our  baseline 
estimates, while   the remaining columns add progressively the interactions. The first thing to note is that there 
are  significant  interactions  when  considered  each  dimension  individually,  indicating  that  the  effects  of  low 
birth  weight  vary  inversely  with  family  advantage  and  economic  developing.  This  is  consistent  with  the 
patterns found in Tables 10 and 11.  The second thing is that the interactions tend to be larger and statistically 
significant for very low birth weight category. This is perhaps unsurprisingly because the effects of birth weight 
are detrimental at lower levels of birth weight. When all interactions are simultaneously added in column (6), 
the  magnitude  and  significance  of  the  interactions  for  education  and  GDP  falls  notably.  In  contrast,  the 
interactions with sanitation and married continue to be large and statistically significant.  

5.  Conclusion 

Despite the important reductions in infant mortality rate worldwide during the last 20 years, it continues to be 
high today in many developing countries. While a variety of factors are likely determinant of poor infant health, 
the understanding of specific  causes is  necessary  for the most  efficient design of policies. Previous studies 
suggest that low birth weight is a major cause of infant mortality, but much of what we know on the causal 
link between these variables is derived from developed countries and there is no a priori reason to believe that 
the results are generalizable to poorer countries. Previous studies for developing countries rely on self-reported 
survey data and do not have access to comprehensive birth record data, which makes it complicated to estimate 
the magnitude of the effect of birth weight on infant mortality.   

In this article, we address these limitations by using rich administrative data on the universe of births in Brazil 
and shed light on the importance of birth weight  for infant health in a developing country context.  Using a 
within-twin identification strategy, we find that lower babies have increased risk of death within one year. Our 
estimates imply that very low birth babies have 4 percentage points higher risk of death within one year. Deaths 
from conditions originating in the perinatal period account for much of these effects. Our results are generally 
larger  than  those  estimated  with  data  from  the  US  and  Norway.  This  finding  illustrates  that  there  may  be 
differences in estimates for developed and developing countries, which suggests that using estimates derived 
from  rich  countries  may  understate  the  benefits  from  interventions  aimed  at  decreasing  infant  mortality  by 
increasing birth weight in developing countries. 

A natural question is why the effect of birth weight in developed and developing countries is different.  Our 
findings suggest that financial constraints and parental attention may be an important explanation. If financial 
constraints hamper the use of important health services or if parental time is a powerful determinant of infant 
health, we should see even larger health impacts of birth weight in poorer regions. Indeed, we find the strongest 
birth  weight  effects  for  infants  born  to  unmarried  and  less-educated  mothers.  In  addition,  we  find  that  the 
effects are reduced when local sanitation coverage is high, suggesting that access to public health infrastructure 
may  mitigate the consequences of low birth weight. Overall,  these findings suggest  that  poverty  is  a likely 
driver  behind  the  differences  we  observe  in  the  effects  of  birth  weight  between  developing  and  developed 
countries. Further research on the topic is needed to clarify these relationships.

Appendix A: A simple test for non-random measurement error 

Consider the twin-fixed effects estimator:  

 𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ1𝑗𝑡

∗ − 𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ2𝑗𝑡

∗ = 𝛽(𝑏𝑤1𝑗𝑡 − 𝑏𝑤2𝑗𝑡) + (𝜀1𝑗𝑡 − 𝜀2𝑗𝑡)           (4)                

where 𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑗𝑡

∗  is the true probability of death, but we only observe:  

𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑗𝑡

∗ + 𝜂𝑖𝑗𝑡 

𝜂𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝜁𝑗𝑡 + 𝜙𝑖𝑗𝑡 

The measurement error is 𝜂𝑖𝑗𝑡, with family-and birth-specific (𝜁𝑗𝑡) and twin-specific (𝜙𝑖𝑗𝑡) components. Since 
the  mortality  outcomes  can  only  take  two  values  (0  or  1),  the  measurement  error  will  be  equal  to  0  if  the 
mortality outcome is measured without error and -1 otherwise. That is, the measurement error will be equal -1 
if an infant in the death records is not matched in one of the births. Thus, the omitted variable formula implies 
that the within-twin estimator of 𝛽 in the equation (4) is given by  

𝛽𝐹𝐸 = 𝛽 +

𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝑏𝑤1𝑗𝑡 − 𝑏𝑤2𝑗𝑡, 𝜙1𝑗𝑡 − 𝜙2𝑗𝑡)

𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑏𝑤1𝑗𝑡 − 𝑏𝑤2𝑗𝑡)

 

The  second  term  of  the  right-hand  side  is  the  resulting  bias  from  the  measurement  error.  Note  that  only  a 
significant correlation between birth weight and the twin-specific component of the measurement error would 

lead to bias in our estimates. As the measurement error is a deterministic function of the probability of being 
matched, the following regression may be used to determine the importance of bias induced by measurement 
error:  

𝐵𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛿𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜑𝑗𝑡 + 𝜉𝑖𝑗𝑡           (5)                

where 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑗𝑡 is a dummy variable indicating whether the infant death record i was matched to one of the 
birth records. The twin-fixed effects are represented by 𝜑𝑗𝑡, while that 𝜉𝑖𝑗𝑡 is an idiosyncratic error term. The 
parameter 𝛿 measures the importance of the bias induced by measurement error. If we are unable to reject the 
hypothesis that 𝛿 = 0, then we would conclude that the measurement error is unlikely to bias our estimates of 
the effect of birth weight on infant mortality.

Notes. The standard errors are in parentheses and are corrected for heteroskedasticity and within-twin-pair correlation in the residuals. 
All  regressions  control  for  infant’s  sex  and  twin-fixed  effects.  More-educated  mothers  refer  to  mothers  who  have  12  years  of 
schooling or more. The dependent variable is mortality within one year of birth. Statistical significance is denoted by: ***p < 0.01,
