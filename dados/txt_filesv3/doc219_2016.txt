Resumo:  Vulnerabilidade  à  pobreza  é  definida  como  a  probabilidade  de  um  decréscimo  do  bem-
estar. A autonomia concedida aos governos  locais através da Constituição  de 1988 e as mudanças 
sociais  e  econômicas  que  o  Brasil  passou  nos  anos  2000  são  capazes  de  mudar  o  cenário 
socioeconômico. Com isso, a unidade de análise escolhida para este estudo é o município, em vez do 
indivíduo. Um Indicador Multidimensional de Pobreza é criado e as probabilidades de mobilidade ao 
longo de sua distribuição são calculadas. Os resultados mostram que, apesar do avanço observado em 
todo  território  brasileiro,  as  regiões  Norte  e  Nordeste  continuam  apresentando  as  privações  mais 
intensas,  enquanto  o  Sul  e  o  Sudeste  permanecem  com  a  incidência  mais  baixa  de  pobreza 
multidimensional.

Abstract:  Vulnerability  to  poverty  is  defined  as  the  probability  of  a  well-being  decrease.  The 
autonomy  conceded  by  Brazil’s  Constitution  to  local  governments  and  the  social  and  economic 
changes that Brazil went through in the 2000’s are capable of changing its socioeconomic scenario. 
Hence, our study’s subject is the municipality, not the individual. A Multidimensional Poverty Index 
is created  and the probabilities of  mobility along  its distribution are calculated.  Results show that, 
despite the improvement observed in its whole national territory, Brazil’s North and Northeast remain 
with deeper deprivations, while the Southern and Southeastern regions present the lowest incidence 
of multidimensional poverty.

1  INTRODUCTION 

Brazil  has  historically  had  a  proportionately  decreasing  number  of  poor  people.  In the  last 
decade, the share of its population in monetary poverty decreased from 41.9% in 1990 to 15.9% in 
2012 and the extreme  poverty rate dropped from  20% to  5.3% in the same period. There is a vast 
literature  focused  on  the  understanding  of  what  causes  poverty  and  on  the  better  alternatives  to 
mitigate it. However, today´s poor may not be the poor of tomorrow. Then, the temporal component 
of poverty starts to draw attention.  

The introduction of the temporal component into poverty analysis takes us to the study of the 
poverty dynamic, which focuses on investigating events of entering, remaining in and getting out of 
deprivation. In this context, the concept of vulnerability is used in different ways by several areas of 
thought, although one commonality is observed: vulnerability is related to the exposure to unknown 
events and to one´s ability to deal with them. The concept adopted in this study is the one embraced 
by economics, defining vulnerability to poverty as the probability of well-being loss. This choice is 
motivated by the lack of this type of study applied to Brazil. Therefore, this paper intends to contribute 
to the identification of factors capable of preventing the incidence and the deepening of poverty, and 
acting towards overcoming poverty as well. 

  As an effort to consider the diverse aspects unrelated to income in the study of vulnerability 
to poverty, the monetary approach is put aside and the multidimensional approach is used to elaborate 
the  well-being  index.  The  Multidimensional  Poverty  Index  (MPI)  is  constructed  with  data  from 
Brazil´s 2000 and 2010 Demographic Census. Unlike what is commonly adopted in the literature of 
vulnerability to poverty, this paper focuses on the municipal level instead of having the individual as 
analysis  unity.  The  municipality  is  chosen  because  the  environment´s  influence  on  individual 
vulnerability to poverty  is significantly  important. In addition, the 1988 Federal Constitution gave 
certain autonomy to the local level of public power, i.e. education and health, and the municipality 
presents specific socioeconomic characteristics, i.e. local labor market and violence; hence this choice 
has proven pertinent. 

Analyzing the 2000-10 socioeconomic scenario, it is possible to observe expressive changes: 
the  Minimum  Wage  had  a  real  appreciation  on the order of  75%, the  productive  de-concentration 
process (initiated in 1970’s) continued, social policies were expanded and the labor market intensified 
its formalization. These changes, however, affect the municipalities in different manners because of 
their particularities. Consequently, the population exposure to these changes brings instabilit y to its 
well-being, which makes necessary the use of its physical, human and social capital to deal with likely 
well-being losses. The government also has an important role in this context, considering that it is 
capable of elaborating public policies to  develop the citizens’ capability of making use of the their 
own  resources  in  a  more  productive  way  and  to  reduce  local  insecurity.  Thus,  changes  in  the 
vulnerability to poverty between 2000 and 2010 for the Brazilian municipalities had been expected. 

In addition to this introduction, this paper is organized into four more sections. The second 
section brings up the theoretical aspects supporting this study. In sequence, the methodology adopted 
to achieve the goals proposed herein is outlined. The fourth section treats the results obtained through 
the application of the methodology described previously. Finally, conclusion and considerations are 
made in the fifth and final section. 

2  VULNERABILITY AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY 

The study of poverty dynamic  is  characterized by the inclusion of the temporal component 
into the analysis of poverty. It mainly focuses on events of entering and overcoming deprivation. In 
this approach, poverty  is divided  into two principal categories:  chronic and transitory. The  former 
maintains individuals under deprivation throughout the whole period studied. In the latter, a person 
moves  into and out of poverty  in the same  time period.  Nonetheless, the criteria utilized to  define 
those two categories are not consensual. 

3 

 
 The  concept  of  vulnerability  emerges  in  the  1970’s  with  studies  on  disaster  risks  and  its 
negative effects. This concept is still adopted in fields such as food safety and health. In Economics, 
vulnerability to poverty is the likelihood of reduction, or loss, in the  well-being, or wealth, below a 
level defined as the minimum accepted in the current social context (SUMNER; MALLETT, 2011). 
Despite the several different applications of the vulnerability study, the result that physical, human 
and social capital are key-elements to understanding the mobility of individuals in poverty and their 
vulnerability to poverty is quite frequent. 

Under the justification that “although poor people are usually among the most vulnerable, not 
all vulnerable people are poor” (MOSER, 1998, p. 3), the author analyzes poverty and vulnerability 
in urban context. The latter is defined as the process of moving in and out of poverty in some period. 
In  the  urban  environment,  labor  is  considered  the  most  important  asset  to  poor  people  because  it 
generates income for instant consumption. While facing a drop in the level of consumption or income, 
the immediate response of poor people is to increase the number of workers in the household. Housing 
also plays a major role in the urban environment: it has capacity to increase safety, making it possible 
for individuals to enjoy opportunities with uncertain results, in addition to providing extra income. 
E.g.: a house bedroom could be rented, or an entrepreneurship undertaking located in the house. Good 
quality of public services, in turn, contributes to the creation of good conditions to make individuals 
able to use their knowledge and assets in a more productive way. Social relations are important as 
well. They enable the support of community members and of institutions when difficulties in dealing 
with  exogenous  well-being  shocks  arise.  For these  reasons, the  capability  of  avoiding  or reducing 
poverty and vulnerability depends not only on the initial stock of assets the person owns but also on 
his / her ability to manage them (MOSER, 1998). 

One of the issues in the monetary approach is that transitory poverty tends to be overestimated 
when  analyzed  by  income  or  consumption.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  a  tendency  of  masking  the 
persistent deprivations capable of keeping poor individuals in poverty, or chronic poverty (HULME; 
SHEPHERD, 2003). The lack of capabilities1, beyond income, is also an obstacle for these persons 
to overcome deprivation situations on their own. 

The  multidimensional  approach  to  poverty  by  ex-ante  perspective  highlights  the  work  of 
Dubois and Rousseau (2008). Similarly to Chaudhuri (2003), the authors define vulnerability as the 
probability of the person being in an worse situation when facing an unexpected shock. With support 
of  the  Capabilities  Approach,  the  reduction  of  vulnerability  is  associated  to  the  development  of 
capabilities to overcome the social consequences related to the occurrence of an unexpected shock. 
So, even if people own assets that could be used to face difficult moments, these assets are not very 
useful  if  these  persons  are  not  capable  of  using  them  correctly.  Among  the  results  found  in  their 
research, a fact stands out: several groups face different types of risks and security is obtained through 
the reduction of vulnerability and through the development of people’s potential2. 

Therefore,  it  is  worth  noticing  that the  physical,  human  and  social  capitals  are  essential  to 
reduce poverty and vulnerability to it. Developing these capitals make individuals able of becoming 
more  prepared  to  face  adverse  situations  that  affect  negatively  their  well-being  level.  Security 
likewise plays a major role here. Personal insecurity can shape behaviors in a way that people would 
not  be  capable  of  investing  in  the  process of  moving  out  of  poverty.  It  can  also  lead  to  situations 
wherein people would be less susceptible to deprivations in the future.  

3  METHODOLOGY 

The  idea  that  monetary  scarcity  is  not  sufficient  to  characterize  poverty  has  been  adopted 
frequently  in  the  studies  of  this  phenomenon  (e.g.  ALKIRE;  FOSTER,  2011;  ATKINSON,  2003; 
BARROS;  CARVALHO;  FRANCO,  2006;  KAGEYAMA;  HOFFMANN,  2006;  KLASEN; 

                                                

1 Capabilities are sets of beings and doings that individuals are able to achieve.  
2 Potential is an individual’s capability to do things the way he/she desires. 

4 

 

GÜNTHER, 2007; MACHADO; GOLGHER; ANTIGO, 2014; OSORIO et al., 2011). Besides their 
monetary needs (e.g., goods consumption), people have also other demands (access to public goods 
and  felling  as  members  of  their  communities).  If  there  is  some  public  policy  focused  on  the 
community they live in, they want to be under its effects. These people also wish to feel capable of 
tracing their own future, with education having a primary role to provide knowledge and to improve 
abilities that make possible the achievement of this goal (CODES, 2008; WOOD, 2003). This being 
said,  the  multidimensional  approach  to  poverty  seems  more  adequate  than  the  uni-dimensional 
framework to study this thematic. Therefore, in order to depict municipal poverty in broader strokes, 
as explained in the section before, this study makes use of the multidimensional approach.  

As regards investigating multidimensional poverty in the Brazilian municipalities, we use data 
from the national Demographic Census 2000 and 2010 to construct a Multidimensional Poverty Index 
(MPI). This index consists of three dimensions: Housing Conditions, Education, and Labor Market 
Participation.  The  dimension  Housing  Conditions  brings  information  on  sewage  water  provision, 
disposal of household waste, presence of items such as radio, color TV and refrigerator (one or two 
doors)  and  overcrowding.  The  dimension  Education  is  related  to  functional  illiteracy  and  school 
attendance rate. Child labor and adult unemployment rates compose the Labor Market dimension.  

Due to the difficulty of working with so much information, the number of variables must be 
reduced without losing the generalizations. Then, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), one of 
the multivariate analysis tools, is used to yield the MPI. The PCA is applied to reduce the quantity of 
information (variables) being analyzed and to facilitate its use and its interpretation. These are done 
by reducing the database dimension, and generating fewer new variables, capable of representing the 
maximum  variability  of  the  original  database  (MINGOTI,  2005).  In  this  present  study,  the  MPI 
indicates  the  poverty  situation  in  the  municipalities,  reported  by  Demographic  Census’  data  from 
years 2000 and 2010. 

With use of the Kaiser’s Normalization Criterion, the main components with eigenvalue larger 
than  1  were  chosen  to  compose  the  MPI  (GREYLING,  2013;  HOQUE,  2014).  The  next  step  is 
calculating their respective values, considering the respective weight of the variables in each chosen 
principal component. Lastly, a weighted average is calculated with these principal components, where 
the weights are their eigenvalues, resulting in the MPI3. This procedure maximizes the variability of 
the data represented by the index. 

After  calculating  the  MPI, through  PCA,  we  rank the  municipalities  in  deciles  as  per  MPI 
distribution – the lower in the MPI’s distribution, the less intense is the poverty in the municipality – 
in the years 2000 and 2010 – 
, respectively – and, then, the municipality’s rankings in 
these two years are compared. The dependent variable was generated following the equation (1): i) if 
the  decile  in  2010  is  higher  than  in  2000,  the  dependent  variable  equals  -1,  meaning  that  the 
deprivation situation worsens; ii) if the decile in 2010 is the same as in 2000, its zero value indicates 
that the position stayed the same in the MPI’s distribution and; iii) the dependent variable assumes 
value equal to 1 if the decile  in 2010  is  lower than  in 2000, indicating an  increase  in citizen well-
being in the municipality. 

 e 

As can be seen, the dependent variable presents three categories of answers (-1, 0 and 1) and 
their order is meaningful, because it is strictly connected to the fact that the municipality’s position 
in the MPI’s distribution in year 2010 can be better, equal or worse than in 2000.

Vulnerability to poverty is defined as the probability of the well-being index falling below a 
specific threshold. Hence, some statistical method capable of calculating this probability is necessary. 
We use the Ordered Probit to do this calculation for each category, because it can deal with dependent 
variables with more than two categories and their order is relevant. In other words, the Ordered Probit 
allows  us  to  predict  the  probabilities  respective  to  each  category  of  answer  to  the  Brazilian 
municipalities  in  years  2000  and  2010,  making  possible  the  identification  of  those  vulnerable  to 
poverty. With the marginal effects of the independent variables, one can analyze the impacts of these 
in the probabilities a municipality presenting immobility, upward or downward movement along the 
MPI’s distribution. 

The  econometric  model’s  dependent  variable  is  the  type  of  movement  along  the  MPI’s 
distribution the municipality presents, i.e. descending, ascending or stable. The independent variables 
consist of: Dropout Rate for the last year of both Elementary School and High School, the dimensions 
of Longevity and Education from the Human Development Index for municipalities4, Child Mortality 
Rate, Homicide Rate, Urban density and Total density Ratio in the Municipality, Gross Value Added 
(GVA)  for  Agriculture,  Industry  and  Services,  Entrepreneur  Rate,  Gini’s  Index,  and  an  index  for 
economic concentration on services activities, named Service Concentration Index. 

The Ordered Probit is estimated using data  from  2000. The  estimated coefficients are then 
used  to  predict  the  probabilities  of  each  municipality  to  show  an  ascending  or  a  descending 
movement, or immobility. This prediction is forecast for both years (2000 and 2010). This procedure 
allows analyzing the influence of the selected attributes on the mobility of the municipality along the 
MPI’s distribution and, therefore, to determine the situation of vulnerability to poverty in both years.  

3.1  Data sources 

The chosen variables to be used in this paper are from Brazil’s 2000 and 2010 Demographic 
Census,  School  Census,  Educational  Indexes,  Mortality  Information  System,  Annual  Relation  of 
Social Information, Ipeadata and from Human Development Atlas for Brazil 2013. The Demographic 
Census,  elaborated  by  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics  (IBGE),  is  a  decennial 
national household survey aimed at building a portrait of the Brazilian population by presenting its 
socioeconomic characteristics, as well as its size and its distribution (INSTITUTO BRASILEIRO DE 
GEOGRAFIA E ESTATISTICA, 2014).  

The  School  Census  by  the  Anísio  Teixeira  National  Institute  of  Educational  Studies  and 
Research (INEP) is an annual survey that gathers educational-statistic information from all national 
basic education systems. The Educational Indexes, elaborated also by INEP, are a synthesis of some 
selected indexes generated from the School Census’ data. Ipeadata is a query tool maintained by the 
Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA) that concentrates in one site primary and secondary 
data and historical series on national, provincial and local level. The Mortality Information System 
(SIM), by the Informatics Department of Health Unique System (DATASUS), gathers periodically 
information about mortality of the entire country. Last, but not least, the Human Development Atlas 
for Brazil 2013 (ADHB-2013)  is a consultation platform of  information about the 5,565 Brazilian 
municipalities, having more than 180 indexes related to population, education, housing, health, labor, 
income and vulnerability, with data from Demographic Census of years 1991, 2000 and 2010. 

3.1.1  Variables 

From the aforementioned databases, the selected variables are listed in Figure 1 herein below:

  Multidimensional Poverty Index 

The three MPI dimensions, based on the Capabilities Approach and listed in the Figure 2, are the 
following:  Housing  Conditions,  Education,  and  Labor  Market  Participation.  Following  MPI 
calculation (through Demographic Census’ data from years 2000 and 2010 for every single Brazilian 
municipality), categories of poverty are created for purposes of comparisons in the analysis of their 
vulnerability. These categories are the position of the municipality  in the MPI distribution deciles, 
which makes possible to classify the municipality - in the 10% of the worst MPI performance or in 
the best-performing 10%.

4.1  Multivariate Analysis and descriptive statistics 

4.1.1  Principal Components Analysis 

PCA was adopted to generate MPI from the sub-dimensions Inadequate Sanitation Services 
or  Sewerage  System,  Non-attendance  of  Water  General  Distribution  Network,  Absence  of  Direct 
Household  Waste  Collection,  Insufficiency  of  Assets,  Overcrowding,  Functional  Illiteracy,  School 
Attendance,  Child Labor  and  Unemployed  Adults.  For the  sake of  comparing  MPI  evolution  from 
2000 through  2010, one  single  PCA  is  applied  linking  these  two  time  periods.  Using  the  Kaiser’s 
Normalization Criterion, the first two principal components were chosen because these were the ones 
with eigenvalue higher than 1. As shown in Table 1, the first component presents 47.2% of the original 
data’s variability and the second component takes a 13.4% share, totaling 60.6% altogether.

The  weights  of  each  variable  in  each  principal  component,  considering  the  respective 
eigenvalues, are reported in Table 2. As can be seen by the combination of the variables weights in 
both components, the overall effect of these sub-dimensions in the MPI is always positive. If we take 
as an example the sub-dimension Unemployed Adults, its Component 2 weight is negative. However, 
combining its effects in Components 1 and 2 – 0.1331 and -0.0791, respectively – leads to an overall 
effect in MPI of 0.0540. This procedure generates the IPM values to each municipality in years 2000 
and 2010.

In general, it can be noticed in Table 3 that there was a general improvement in all MPI’s sub-
dimensions as the observed means in year 2000 are inferior to those in 2010. Comparing the standard 
deviations of these sub-dimensions draws attention, except for Unemployed Adults and Child Labor, 
and their means, indicating the presence of outliers and the existence of an expressive heterogeneity. 
The  maximum  values  of  the  sub-dimensions  Insufficiency  of  Assets,  Overcrowding,  Functional 
Illiteracy,  School  Absence,  Child  Labor  and  Unemployed  Adults  were  reduced  from  year  2000  to 
2010.  However,  despite  this  improvement trend, the  highest  values  of  each  sub-dimension  remain 
still concentrated in the country’s Northern and Northeastern regions.  

The break values in Figure 3 were defined according to the MPI’s distribution in year 2000. 
The first one features 25% of the index’s ordered values, while the second  lies in-between the first 
and second distribution quartile. The third interval is the range between the second and third quartile. 
The fourth break value is the 99th percentile, remaining the last 1% of the MPI’s values to be inserted 
in the last interval. As said before, the MPI was constructed by the sub-dimensions shown in Table 3 
herein and normalized to assume values from 0 to 1. Hence, the closer to 0, the less intense municipal 
poverty  is;  and  the  closer  to  1,  the  deprivation  situation  gets  deeper.  Consequently,  lower-value 
municipalities  are  situated  in  the  initial  percentiles  and  the ones  with  higher  values  are  in  the  last 
percentiles.  

The  MPI  mean  drops  from  0.28  in  2000  to  0.19 in  2010.  As  seen  in  Figure  3, the  highest 
values, between 0.58 and 0.75 in 2000, are concentrated in the Micro-regions Gurupi and Lençóis 
Maranhenses,  both  in  the  province  of  Maranhão,  and  Guamá  in  Pará.  When  analyzing  the 
municipalities  with  values  between  0.36  and  0.58,  it  is  observed  that they  are  concentrated  in  the 
regions North and Northeast, in the Meso-regions North and Northeast Mato-grossense in the Mato 
Grosso province and in Northern Minas Gerais. In 2010, the municipalities categorized in the fourth 
interval are all in Northern Brazil, albeit they also can be seen in the Meso-regions East, North and 
West of Maranhão. Clusters of  municipalities with MPI’s values between 0.26 and 0.36, classified 
between the second and third quartile, changed  their location  in the period 2000-10 - moving from 
Northeastern  and  Midwestern  Brazil,  Northern-Central  Minas  Gerais  and  from  the  Micro-regions 
Ivaiporã and Pitanga in Paraná (Southern Brazil) to the North of the country and to the provinces of 
Maranhão and Piauí. 

Municipalities  in  the  second  interval,  from  0.17  to  0.26,  were  located  in  year  2000  in  the 
provinces of Paraná, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and Roraima, 
as well as  in  Southeastern Minas Gerais and  in the Meso-region South Goiano,  in Goiás. In 2010, 
however, the presence of municipalities with MPI values in this interval became more homogeneous 
in the regions Midwest and Northeast, except in the provinces of Maranhão, Paraná and Roraima, and 
in Northern Minas Gerais.

Note: The number of observation is inferior to the number of existing municipalities in 2000 by one. Nova Ramada (a RS municipality) has all its households in rural 
area in the Demographic Census 2000, so it was removed from the data for both years, 2000 and 2010, as it would not be possible to make any kind of comparisons for 
this municipality between these two years.

The municipalities with the lowest indicator values in 2000, belonging to the first break, were 
concentrated almost exclusively in the province of São Paulo and in these Meso-regions: Campo das 
Vertentes,  Metropolitan  Belo  Horizonte,  Western  Minas,  South-southeastern  Minas  and  Triângulo 
Mineiro-High  Parnaíba;  Greater  Florianópolis,  North  Catarinense  and  Itajaí  River  Valley  in  Santa 
Catarina and; Northeast, Southeast and Western-Central Riograndense and Metropolitan Porto Alegre 
in the province of Rio Grande do Sul. In 2010, the presence of municipalities with MPI values in the 
first range expands to the rest of the provinces of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Rio de Janeiro, 
Espírito  Santo  and  Paraná,  and  also  in  the  Meso-regions  Southern  Goiano,  Central  Mineira, 
Borborema and Sertão Paraibano, and in Central Potiguar in the province of Rio Grande do Norte. 

Therefore, it appears that there was an across-the-board multidimensional deprivation relief 
from 2000 through 2010. This is due to the improvement of the overall national framework in all sub-
dimensions used for MPI construction. However, multidimensional poverty  is to this day a typical 
problem  in  the  country’s  North,  Northeast  and  Midwest,  while  Southern  and  Southeastern  Brazil 
remain the lowest-incidence regions. 

Following  MPI  calculation  and  having  obtained  each  municipality’s  deciles  (as  described 
herein  above,  in  Methodology),  the  next  step  was  elaborating  the  model’s  dependent  variable 
representing the transition of the municipalities along the MPI’s distribution between the years 2000 
and  2010.  As  the  initial  position  in  the  distribution  represents  a  better  multidimensional  poverty 
situation in the municipality, the descending movement is defined as the loss of one better position 
in  2000  through  2010,  while  the  ascending  movement  is  the  gain  of  one  position  closer  to  the 
beginning of the distribution. So, as can be seen in Figure 4, the dependent variable has a value equal 
to -1 if the municipality in 2010 was found in a worse position than in 2000 – i.e., a higher decile in 
2010 than in 2000 –, value equal to zero if the decile in 2010 is the same decile as in 2000 (stability) 
and value equal to 1 if the position in 2010 is better than in 2000, meaning the 2010 decil is lower 
than in 2000.  

                                                

5 The last break is the last distribution percentile.  

 

Figure 4 – Elaboration of the dependent variable

Table 4 shows municipality transition by deciles. Among the municipalities in the first decile 
of  the  MPI’s  distribution  in  2000,  66%  remained  in  the  same  position  in  2010.  The  proportion of 
municipalities with stable position along the distribution in the same time period shows a downward 
trend  down  to the  fifth  decile,  reaching  29.5%  of the  municipalities.  After  the  seventh  decile,  the 
proportion  increases  until  the  last  decil,  from  23.1%  to  66.4%.  This  elevated  percentage  of 
municipalities maintaining their position through the period analyzed in the first and in the last deciles 
is in line with expectations. The more intense the poverty, the harder it is to overcome it; to wit, 66.4% 
and 37.2% of the municipalities in the last and in the ninth decile, respectively, in year 2000 continued 
in the same decile in year 2010. Similarly, the less intense the poverty, the easier  it is to remain in 
this situation, which can explain the fact that 66.1% of the municipalities that were in the first decil 
and 42.8% in the last, in year 2000, kept their position in year 2010. 

It is also noteworthy that most municipalities with some movement in the MPI’s distribution 
over 2000-10, either loss or gain, were limited to transitions from one position only, up or down. For 
example, among municipalities  in the fourth decile in 2000, 22.2% moved up one position in 2010 
and 23.1% lost one position. It can be noticed, as well, that the lower the decil being analyzed, the 
greater the percentage of municipalities losing positions to lower deciles. Among the municipalities 
in the second decile in year 2000, the highest decile reached in 2010 was the seventh, 0.54% of the 
municipalities. For the fifth decile in 2000, the percentage of municipalities reaching the seventh decil 
in 2010 is 12.7%, while the highest attained was the ninth, with 1.1% of the municipalities. When 
analyzing the upward transitions, the reasoning is analogous and inverse, except for the last decile in 
2000, which has 0.2% of the municipalities reaching the first decile in 2010. 

Table 5 summarizes  municipality  transition along the MPI’s distribution between the years 
2000  and  2010,  broken  down  by  Brazilian  regions.  Of  the  country’s  5,506  municipalities,  1,770 
moved  up  to  higher  deciles  in  2010,  2,147  remained  in  the  same  decil  as  in  2000,  while  1,589 
municipalities  dropped  positions  to  lower  deciles,  corresponding  to  32.2%,  39%  and  28.9%, 
respectively.  

Among  the  five  Brazilian  regions,  the  South  was  the  one  with  the  highest  percentage  of 
worsening distribution (44.7% of its municipalities). The Southeast was the region with the highest 
percentage of municipalities maintaining their positions throughout 2000-10, with 44.4%, while the 
Northeast had the country’s greatest percentage of municipalities ascending in the MPI’s distribution 
(32.8%). A possible explanation for this result in the Southern region is the evolution of all MPI’s 
sub-dimensions  in  other  Brazilian  regions.  Although  the  Southern  municipalities  presented 
intermediate  values  in  2000,  their  improvement  observed  in  year  2010  was  less  pronounced  in

comparison  to  the  progress  in  the  municipalities  of  other  states  with  higher  values  for  their  sub-
dimensions. Meanwhile, the Southeastern  region  was already  marked,  in 2000, by the presence of 
lower values for all its sub-dimensions. This continued in 2010, so that the other municipalities were 
not able to achieve similar values. As the Northeastern counties were among those with higher values 
for the IPM in 2000, the general improvement, expressive in many cases, in the sub-dimensions has 
enabled these municipalities to gain distribution positions.

4.2  Estimation Results 

Table 6 shows the coefficients of each independent variables obtained in the estimation of the 
econometric model defined in the methodology section  herein above, as well as the their marginal 
effects  in  the  three  categories  of  the  dependent  variable:  descending  movement,  immobility  and 
ascending movement. Even if the coefficient signal may convey a general idea about the influence of 
the variable on the model, the analysis of marginal effects provides a more complete interpretation of 
its  impact.  Thus,  this  paper  will  focus  on  the  marginal  effects.  It  is  worth  remembering  that  the 
estimation of the coefficients refers to the values of the independent variables in the year 2000. 

The variables Dropout Rate of Grades 8-9 of Elementary School, Dropout Rate of Grades 3-
4 of High School and HDI-M Education have marginal effects meeting the hypotheses that education 
enhances the ability of dealing with  vulnerability  situations. However, only the coefficients of the 
two  last  variables  are  statistically  significant  in  the  estimation.  The  results  of  the  dropout  rates 
indicates that the last year of High School (senior year) is able to empower individuals for social and 
professional needs in their adult life more efficiently than Elementary School’s senior year can. The 
increase of 1 percentage point (p.p) in the Dropout Rate of Grades 3-4 of High School elevates the 
municipality’s  probability  of  descending  in  the  distribution  of  the  MPI  by  0.07p.p.  This  same 
increase, on the other hand, reduces the likelihood of stability or ascending by 0.01p.p. and 0.06p.p., 
respectively.  

The 0.001 increase in HDI-M Education – this variable measures adult population schooling 
and youngsters’ study flow – decreases the likelihood of the municipality descending in the MPI’s 
distribution  by  0.018p.p.  Reversely,  this  same  increase  causes  a  rise  in  the  probability  of  both 
immobility and ascension by 0.002p.p. and 0.017p.p., respectively. The better results of the variables 
Dropout  Rate  of  Grades  3-4  of  High  School  and  HDI-M  Education  are  consequences  of  quality 
improvement in municipal education. Such results reflect in a High School able to keep more students 
in  school,  in  a  decrease  in  the  grade-age  distortion  of  the  educational  system  and  a  rise  in  adult 
population schooling. Thus, these variables directly affect the sub-dimensions Functional Illiteracy, 
School Absence and Child Labor.

A  more  developed  human  capital,  on  one  hand,  deepens  the  demand  for  an  efficient 
government  performance.  This  could  strengthen  outcries  for  better  public  services  supply, 
represented  in  the  sub-dimensions  Inadequate  Sanitation  Services  or  Sewerage  System,  Non-
attendance  of  Water  General  Distribution  Network  and  Absence  of  Direct  Household  Waste 
Collection. On the other hand, it has a positive influence on citizenry productivity and their insertion 
capacity  into  the  labor  market,  affecting  indirectly  the  sub-dimensions  Unemployed  Adults, 
Insufficiency of Assets and Overcrowding, the latter two via labor income. These results, therefore, 
show that  education  has  a  positive  effect  in  preventing  the  deepening  of  deprivation  in  these  sub-
dimensions and, consequently, it reflects in the decline of municipal vulnerability to poverty.   

HDI-M  Longevity  presented  a  statistically  significant  coefficient  and  marginal  effects  as 
expected.  The  0.001  rise  in  this  variable  causes  a  0.041p.p  decrease  in  the  probability  of  the 
municipality losing position along the MPI’s distribution, a 0.035p.p elevation in the likelihood of 
stability  and  an  increase  by  0.038p.p.  in  the  probability  of  the  municipality  presenting  a  better 
distribution position in future years. These results could be attributed to the ratio between residents’ 
life expectancy at birth and their later physical and mental health conditions. The growth of the former 
indicates better conditions of the latter, reflecting in the population’s ability to use its physical  and 
human resources in a productive manner. This could be directly related to labor income and to labor 
market  inclusion,  since  better  physical  and  mental  health  conditions  lead  to  greater  productivity. 
Therefore, municipalities with higher HDI-M Longevity values would be able to avoid intensification 
of deprivations in the sub-dimensions Unemployed Adults, Insufficiency of Assets and Overcrowding 
and, hence, future MPI reductions.  

The coefficients of the variables Child Mortality Rate, Homicide Rate and Urban and Total 
Density Ratio were not statistically significant. Unlike these variables,  Population logarithm had a 
statistically significant coefficient in the estimation. Its one-unit rise causes an increase of 2.93p.p. in 
the probability of a municipal descending movement in MPI distribution, while its seesaw effects on 
the likelihood of immobility decreases by 0.25p.p. As for the ascending movement, a one-unit rise in 
this variable drops the probability by 2.69p.p. Hence, the larger its population, the more vulnerable 
is  a  municipality.  The  results  found  in  Population  logarithm  could  relate  to  a  larger  number  of 
municipal  residents,  to  greater  demand  for  resources,  for  basic  public  services  and  economic 
opportunities  that  would  enable  its  citizens  to  mitigate  their  dire-straights  poverty.  This  greater 
demand, then, is harder to be met if compared to demands in lesser-populated municipalities.  

16 

 
Among all Gross Value Added per capita broken down by economy sectors, only the Industry 
coefficient  was  statistically  significant.  Its  R$1.00  rise  would  reduce  the  likelihood  of  the 
municipality descending in the MPI’s distribution  by 0.48 p.p., while the probability of immobility 
increases  by  0.04p.p  and  the  probability  of  an  upward  movement  rises  by  0.44p.p.  The  positive 
contribution of Industrial Gross Value Added per capita in reducing vulnerability to poverty could 
be linked to the fact that, in the analyzed period, there was an intensification of industrial activity in 
the  whole  country,  sparking  expressive  job  creation  increase  and  triggering  growth  of  municipal 
income per capita. As a result, the mitigation of the sub-dimensions Unemployed Adult, Insufficiency 
of Assets and Overcrowding may have been more intense in municipalities wherein Industry ruled the 
day as the chief local economic activity.  Production increase in such counties may also have led to 
higher tax collection, broadening the availability of resources to fund the expansion of basic public 
services.  

The  Service  Concentration  Index  coefficient  was  statistically  significant  and  its  effect  on 
poverty dynamics was aligned with expectations. Recalling that this index’s range is from 0 to 1, the 
analysis considers  the variation  in thousandths, to  make  it easier.  A 0.001 increase in this variable 
reduces the likelihood of losing position in the MPI’s distribution by 0.055p.p. As regards immobility 
and  the  ascending  movement,  probability  elevations  are  in  the  order  of  0.005p.p.  and  0.05p.p., 
respectively. Greater polarization capacity implies that the municipality’s economy is more dynamic 
and  that  the  county  concentrates  services  more  complex  to  its  productive  activities,  i.e.  financial 
services. This conjunction of factors offers the local population a wider range of possible economic 
activities, resulting in the same positive effects already mentioned regarding income (vide MPI’s sub-
dimensions).  

The Gini’s Index did not have statistically significant coefficients in the estimation. However, 
the Entrepreneur Rate coefficient was statistically significant and aligned with expectations. A 1p.p. 
rise in municipal entrepreneurship percentage would reduce the probability of losing position in the 
MPI’s distribution by 0.31 p.p., while the likelihood of immobility would increase by 0.03p.p. and 
the probability of ascending would rise by 0.29p.p. Entrepreneurship, in addition to being a source of 
extra income to the individual, also creates jobs nearby. Thus, the higher the number of entrepreneurs 
in the  municipality, the  higher  municipal  entrepreneurship  soars, begetting  more  job opportunities 
and income sources in the municipality. The effects of changing this variable on the MPI are the same 
already discussed in this section, regarding income. 

Coefficients of control variables Region and Decile in 2000 were all statistically significant. 
Using  Northern  Brazil  for  comparative  purposes,  the  fact  that  a  municipality  is  located  in  the 
Northeast  decreases  the  probability  of  it  losing  position  by  19.28p.p.  Southeastern  municipalities 
would see a 27.32p.p reduction. Reduction in the Brazilian South and Midwest would be 8.30p.p. and 
8.99p.p., respectively. Analyzing the marginal effect of regions in the likelihood of immobility, the 
probability increase is 4.94p.p. for municipalities in the Northeast, 4.27p.p. in the Southeast, 3.01 in 
the South and 3.21p.p. in the Midwest – all compared to Brazil’s Northern Region, and the marginal 
effect for the upward movement is 14.33p.p., 23.05p.p., 5.29p.p., and 5,78p.p., respectively. These 
results  indicate  that  regions  have  intrinsic  characteristics  not  covered  in  the  estimated  model,  i.e. 
institutional relations, which directly interfere in the poverty dynamics of their municipalities.  

The signs of marginal effects of the variable Decile in 2000 went against the expected result. 
Taking the first decile as reference, it can be noticed that the closer to the beginning of the MPI’s 
distribution, with the exception of the seventh decile, the greater the likelihood of the municipality 
moving upwards. That is, the less intense the poverty in the municipality, the higher its vulnerability. 
Municipalities in-between the fifth and the seventh decile are more likely to  be in  immobility than 
the  other  categories  of  movement.  Municipalities  at  the  book-end  positions  in  the  distribution  are 
more  likely  to  have  ascending  movements  rather  than  lie  in  immobility  and  to  be  in  descending 
movement. That is, the less intense the poverty in the municipality, the lower its vulnerability. These 
results could be justified by the MPI improvement from year 2000 through 2010 - more expressive 

17 

 

in those municipalities located in the final distribution positions (vide Figure 3 herein). Furthermore, 
progress in the MPI of municipalities at the initial distribution positions was less intense, resulting in 
loss of positions to those municipalities on the rise. 

After coefficients were estimated, the likelihood of the Brazilian municipality in each possible 
category of the dependent variable was predicted.  A  municipality was considered  vulnerable  if  its 
probability of descending movement was greater than the likelihood of immobility and of ascending 
movement as well. A total of 4,797 municipalities had these probabilities predicted in year 2000, less 
than the 5,506 observations in the dataset because some of them did not have information on some 
selected independent variables. 

Table 7 shows the regional distribution of the vulnerable and non-vulnerable municipalities 
in year 2000, namely: 39% of municipalities in the Northern region were vulnerable in 2000, 10.1% 
in  the  Northeast,  15.6%  in  the  Southeast,  63.6  %  in  the  South  and  34.5%  in  the  Midwest.  This 
amounted to 28% of the cities analyzed in a state of vulnerability to poverty in 2000. Given the spatial 
distribution of the IPM and of the independent variables in each region, one would expect that the 
North  and  Northeast  regions  would  have  the  greatest  percentage  of  vulnerable  municipalities, 
followed by the Midwest, South and Southeast, in that order. However, it draws attention the high 
percentage of vulnerable municipalities in the South in 2000, despite less intense deprivations in the 
IPM’s  sub-dimensions.  This  may  be  due to  the  weight of  agriculture  in  the  local  economy  and  to 
demographic concentration. Large population needs an economy more dynamic to be able to meet 
larger  demands  of  basic  infrastructure,  education  and  jobs.  The  agriculture,  in  turn,  is  not  able  to 
foster  the  economy  dynamism  enough  to  meet  these  demands.  It  is  worth  remembering  that 
agriculture  is  characterized  by  the  absorption  of  low-paid  low-skilled  workers.  Another  possible 
explanation is the concentration of approximately 50% of the municipalities between the third and 
fifth decile of MPI’s distribution in this year, positions more susceptible to be surpassed by counties 
in lower deciles.  

Also noteworthy  is the low percentage of vulnerable municipalities in the Northeast in year 
2000. One would expect that, because of the intense presence of high MPI values in this region, the 
less dynamic economy in the national context and the worse performance by independent variables, 
the number of  Northeastern  municipalities  in a vulnerable situation would have been greater. This 
may be due to the fact that the Northeastern counties were concentrated mostly in the last deciles in 
year  2000.  Thus,  they  were  already  in  the  end  of  the  distribution  and  could  not  incur  any  further 
position loss.

The regional distribution of vulnerable municipalities in 2010 is presented in Table 8. Due to 
the same reason discussed  for the  year 2000, the number of  municipalities with their probabilities 
calculated is 5,489, lower than the 5,506 municipalities in the sample. However, even with this rise 
in the number of municipalities being analyzed, there was a decrease of 12.32p.p in the number of 
vulnerable municipalities in 2010. Comparing results in Tables 7 and 8 herein, a reduction is present 
in all Brazilian regions. In the North, the percentage of vulnerable municipalities fell from 39% to 

18 

 

11.6%. In the Northeast, the decrease was from 10.1% to 0.5%, while in the Southeast the reduction 
was from 15.6% to 13.3%. In the South, this drop was from 63.6% to 44.4%, while the number of 
vulnerable municipalities in the Midwest fell from 34.5% in 2000 to 14.4% in 2010. 

The results for 2010 are similar to those for 2000. The Northeast region continues to have the 
lowest percentage of vulnerable municipalities and the South continues with the highest proportion. 
Despite improved independent variables in the whole country, the features that contribute positively 
to  increase  the  likelihood  of  the  municipality  descend  in  the  MPI’s  distribution  –  Logarithm  of 
Population,  GVA  per  capita  of  Agriculture  and  the  GVA  per  capita  of  Services  –  showed  no 
significant  changes  in  their  spatial  configuration.  The  high  values  for  the  first  and  third  variables 
remained concentrated in the South/Southeast axis and agricultural activity remains significant in the 
South. On the other hand, those variables that contribute to reducing the vulnerability improved in all 
Brazilian regions.

Even  with  an  improved  national  framework  of  multidimensional  poverty,  (vide  Figure  3), 
there was  little change  in the relationship  between the regions and the positions occupied by their 
municipalities in year 2010 MPI distribution: Northern municipalities still remained in the top deciles 
and  Southern  municipalities  have  kept  their  initial  positions.  Hence,  there  is  evidence  that 
municipality ranking in the MPI’s distribution is a determining factor for their vulnerability. 

Summing  up  the  results, the  variables  Dropout  Rate  of  Grade  3-4  of  High  School,  HDI-M 
Education,  HDI-M  Longevity,  Logarithm  of  the  Population,  Gross  Value  Added  per  capita  of 
Industry, Service Concentration Index and Entrepreneur Rate contribute positively to the reduction 
of municipal vulnerability to poverty. The less intense is poverty in the municipality, the greater the 
likelihood of it losing distribution position; and the more intense are the deprivations, the lower is the 
vulnerability to poverty. Compared to Northern municipalities, Southeastern Brazil has reduced more 
significantly the likelihood of position loss and has had a greater effect of increasing the probability 
of  its upward movement. Albeit the number of vulnerable municipalities in Brazil fell by 12,32p.p 
between  2000  and  2010,  the  Northeast  continued  to  show  the  lowest  number  of  vulnerable 
municipalities and the South, the largest. 

5  FINAL REMARKS 

Using  municipality as the unit of analysis  made  it possible to map the regional  and spatial 
rearrangement of a welfare index, such as the MPI. Many of its dimensions are more associated with 
public  policies  rather  than  with  consciously-made  choices  of  municipal  residents.  Moreover,  the 
construction of the MPI  in this study allowed, at first, to  identify the  multidimensional poverty of 
Brazilian municipalities, addressing important aspects not directly related to income. Data of the 2000 
and  2010  Census  show  improvements  in  the  framework  of  multidimensional  poverty  throughout 
Brazil.  This  is  due  to  developments  observed  in  all  sub-dimensions  used  to  construct  the  index. 
Descriptive  statistics  also  support  the  conclusion  that  even  with  this  improvement,  the  North, 
Northeast  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  Midwest  continued  to  experience  the  deepest  deprivation 

19 

 

situation.  The  South  and  Southeast,  however,  remained  with  the  best  MPI  performances. 
Nevertheless, the presence of intra-regional heterogeneity is also observed. 

In  our  analysis  of  Brazilian  municipality  transition  along  MPI’s  distribution  in  the  period 
2000-10,  two-thirds  of  them  were  located,  in  2010,  in  the  same  deciles  as  in  2000.  The  highest 
percentage of municipalities in immobility was found in the initial and final distribution positions. As 
result, the South showed the highest percentage of municipalities that lost position, 44.7%, while the 
Southeast  stood  out  in  the  item  immobility,  44.4%,  and  the  Northeast  was  home  to  the  largest 
proportion of municipalities on the rise, 32.8%.  

The descriptive statistics allow us, in a certain way, to identify socioeconomic changes that 
Brazil has been through between 2000 and 2010. In the economy, productive activity spread through 
the  country,  continuing  the  process  of  decentralization  initiated  in  1970.  This  increased  economic 
dynamism  as  a  whole,  in  turn,  generated  more  business  opportunities  for  Brazilians.  As  a  result, 
municipalities that once were at the margin of economic development began to be affected by it more 
intensely,  bringing  socioeconomic  changes  to  Brazil.  However,  the  localities  that  excel  in  the 
Brazilian  economy  in  2010  were  quite  the  same  as  in  2000.  Social  progress  observed  in  the 
municipalities was remarkable, caused by government actions implemented in the period of 2000-10 
and boosted by the new economic  framework. It can be said that, in 2010, the population of these 
municipalities enjoyed a better quality of life. Significant educational improvements and reduction of 
the income concentration gap are also worthy to mention. However, economic progress also deepens 
social ills, such as criminality. 

This MPI vulnerability perspective adds further evidence of relative gains in involving local 
government in drawing up social policies, a trend dating back to Brazil’s 1988 Federal Constitution. 
The  effects  of  the  independent  variables  in  the  likelihood  of  each  type  of  movement  for  the 
municipality have contributed to identify factors that should become priorities in poverty-mitigation 
public policies.  

When  analyzing  the  effect  of  the  municipality’s  initial  MPI  distribution  position,  the 
conclusion  is  the  opposite  of  what  was  expected.  The  estimation  results  show  that the  deeper  the 
poverty in the municipality, the lower its vulnerability. A higher proportion of municipalities showing 
downward movements were located in intermediate positions, while most municipalities in an upward 
movement occupied late slots - which might explain this counter-expectation conclusion. However, 
these effects require further analysis at a later work.
