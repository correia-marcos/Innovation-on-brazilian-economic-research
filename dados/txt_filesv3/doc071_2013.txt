Abstract

This paper proposes a model to study how conditional lending and immediate liquidity provision
a⁄ect incentives for (cid:133)scal adjustment in a country facing the risk of sovereign default. Conditional
lending provides explicit incentives for (cid:133)scal adjustment but immediate liquidity provision is more
e⁄ective in reducing liquidation costs. For some parameters, immediate liquidity provision in-
duces (cid:133)scal adjustment and debt repayment, while conditional lending does not (and vice-versa).
Incentives for (cid:133)scal adjustment are concave in the fraction of lending that is provided under con-
ditionalities. Therefore, the best strategy for an international lending of last resort might be a
balance between immediate liquidity support and conditional lending. A large cost of tight (cid:133)scal
policy shifts the balance towards immediate liquidity provision.
