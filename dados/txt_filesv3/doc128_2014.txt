Abstract 

The main aim of this paper is to analyse  how individual perceptions of academic researchers 
about  the  benefits,  results  and  barriers  affect  their  interactions  with  firms.  University  has 
become  a growing important source  of knowledge for innovation  and firms are trying to get 
closer  to  the  university  in  order  to  appropriate  of  the  knowledge  generated  by  academic 
research.  To  evaluate  the  effect  of  the  benefits,  results  and  barriers,  a  comprehensive 
database  from  a  survey  to  Brazilian  research  groups’  leaders  was  used.  Non-parametric  IRT 
(Item Response Theory) technique was applied and clusters of responses were formed to each 
dimension.  Then,  these  clusters  were  used  to  build  an  econometric  model  to  evaluate  the 
importance  of  the  dimensions.  Main  findings  show  that  intellectual  benefits  and  academic 
results are important drivers to research groups to collaborate with industry and transactional 
barriers  represent  important  obstacles  to  academic  research  groups  to  interact  more  with 
firms.  These  findings  allow  a  better  understanding  of  the  main  motivations  and  constrains 
faced by research groups in the collaboration with firms.

Benefits, results and barriers to interaction to industry: the perspective of academic 

research groups 

 

Introduction 

Academic research plays an important role for the firms’ innovation. It’s widely accepted in the 
literature  that  university  is  a  very  important  source  of  new  scientific  and  technological 
knowledge and university-industry linkages are a vital channel for this collaboration. There is a 
growing literature that evaluates the main factors that affect university-industry interactions. 
Some of them, focused on the impact of interactions for innovation and the role of academic 
research (Klevorick et al., 1995; Nelson, 1996; Cohen et al., 2002). Other studies have analysed 
the main factors that affect interactions and how individuals evaluate such relations and their 
potential benefits, results and barriers (Arza and Vasquez, 2010; D'Este and Perkmann, 2011; 
Tartari and Breschi, 2012; Tartari et al., 2012). 

It  must  be  recognised  that  university  and  industry  operate  within  different  institutional 
environment, with some important potentially conflicting norms and incentives (Dasgupta and 
David, 1994; Tartari et at., 2012). Academic researchers seek to generate new knowledge and 
publish their results in high-impact journals; scientists and engineers in firms are concerned to 
produce applied knowledge in valuable products and manufacturing processes. In this way, an 
important question that emerges from this problem is what drives research groups to interact 
to industrial partners. 

Based  on  these  assumptions,  this  paper  aims  to  investigate  how  individual  perceptions  of 
academic  researchers  about  the  benefits,  results  and  barriers  affect  their  interactions  with 
firms. To do that, it was  used original  and comprehensive  data from a survey with academic 
research  groups  that  have  linkages  with  firms  in  Brazil.  Data  were  organized  by  using 
nonparametric  IRT  (Item  Response  Theory)  technique,  which  allows  the  formation  of  non-
arbitrary  clusters  based  on  the  pattern  of  responses  of  the  questionnaire.  By  using  these 
clusters,  an  estimated  model  that  evaluates  how  benefits,  results  and  barriers  affect 
collaborations with industry was built. 

Despite the recent growth of the literature about university-industry linkages, there are some 
missing points in the  studies,  such as  how  university initiate,  build and maintain interactions 
with  firms.  The  motivation  to  engage  to  collaborate  with  industry  and  the  role  of  the  main 
outcomes from the linkages are questions that must receive deeper analysis (Perkmann et al., 
2013).  In  this  way,  this  paper  adds  new  contribution  on  the  understanding  of  the  main 
motivations  and  constrains  faced  by  research  groups  in  the  collaboration  with  firm,  by 
analysing the  role of  the  benefits and results of the  interactions with firms and the effect of 
the  main  barriers  to  establish  collaboration.  The  analysis  of  the  paper  is  based  on  the 
individual responses of the Brazilian research groups that interact with firms, which allow the 
understanding  of  their  perceptions  on  the  main  factors  that  stimulate  and  constrain  the 
collaboration with firms. 

The  paper  is  organised  into  5  sections,  in  addition  to  this  introduction.  The  first  section 
presents the main conceptual remarks from the debate on university-industry linkages and the 
effects of the  benefits, results and barriers for the  interactions. Section two presents a brief 
description  of  data  and  section  three  presents  the  application  of  the  nonparametric  IRT 
methodology  for  the  responses  of  the  questionnaire.  Section  four  presents  the  empirical 
model and discusses the effects of the benefits, results and barriers. Finally, section five brings 
final remarks and some policy implications.

1.  Theoretical  remarks  on  the  effects  of  the  benefits,  results  and  barriers  to  university 

collaborate industry 

Innovation  is  far  from  an  isolated  process  within  firms.  Several  studies  have  showed  the 
importance  of  external  agents  that  strengthen  firms’  in-house  R&D  expenditures,  such  as 
users,  suppliers,  and  university.  The  increasing  complexity  of  knowledge  required  for 
innovation forced firms to become closer to these external sources (Nelson, 1996; Mowery et 
al., 2004). Academic research, and the university, has become a growing important source of 
knowledge  both  for  firms  and  for  the  whole  society  (Rosenberg  and  Nelson,  1994).  Several 
authors, such as Klevorick  et al. (1995) and Cohen et al. (2002),  have  showed that university 
has assumed an increasingly important role in fostering innovation in firms1.  

Besides  this  positive  evaluation  of  the  collaboration  between  universities  and  firms  for  the 
sharing  of  scientific  knowledge,  there  are  some  serious  concerns  about  some  possible 
damages  to  the  principles  of  open  science  (Merton,  1973).  The  market-orientation  of 
university research, towards firms’ innovative problem, may imply fewer publications, as well 
as  changes  in  the  research  agenda  of  the  university.  Orientation  problems  can  also emerge, 
since  firms’  innovative  projects  are  usually  linked  to  short-term  problems  driven  by  their 
operational  needs  (Tartari  et  al.,  2012).  It  has  long  been  recognized  that  there  are  different 
nature of the goals accepted as legitimate within the community of academic researchers and 
the community of firms R&D staff. The community of academic researchers is concerned with 
additions  to  the  stock  of  public  knowledge,  whereas  the  community  of  firms’  researchers  is 
concerned  with  adding  to  the  stream  of  rents  that  may  be  derived  from  possession  of  the 
rights  to  use  private  knowledge. However,  in  order  to  ensure  a  reasonably  societal  efficient 
allocation  of  resources  in  the  production  of  new  knowledge,  society  needs  to  have  both 
communities firmly in place, and attend to maintaining a synergetic equilibrium between them 
(Dasgupta and David, 1994). 

Based  on  this  concern,  there  is  a  growing  interest  on  the  evaluation  of  the  effects  of  the 
engagement of academic researchers with firms on the activities of the university (D’Este and 
Patel, 2007;  Arza, 2010; Bishop et al., 2011; D’Este  and Perkmann,  2011;  Tartari et al., 2012; 
Perkmann et al., 2013; Tartari et al., 2014). Several studies have investigated the effect of the 
individual evaluation of the scientists of the expected benefits and costs on their collaboration 
with firms (Owen-Smith and Powell, 2001; Tartari and Breschi; 2012). 

Regarding  benefits,  the  engagement  of  academic  researchers  with  industry  can  bring  some 
important benefits.  Many  researchers engage  with industry  mainly to support their research 
activities.  Collaboration  with  industry  is  mainly  dominated  by  research-related  motivations, 
including learning from industry and fund raising for research projects (D’Este and Perkmann, 
2011).  Relationships  with  firms  are  willing  to  approach  academic  researchers  to  industrial 
partners,  since  the  interaction  involves  close  collaboration  among  them.  Close  collaboration 
facilitates  interactive  learning  which  in  turn  indirectly  benefits  scientific  production  by 
generating new ideas and motivating new research projects, even with it maintains the distinct 
logic of both university and industry (Perkmann and Walsh, 2009). Intellectual benefits such as 
improved  access  to  industrial  partnerships  and  the  possibility  of  working  together  with 
industrial researchers can provide to scientists the possibility to knowledge sharing, which can 
stimulate the development of new collaborative research projects (Garrett-Jones et al., 2010).  

Two main benefits for  universities from their interactions with firms  are usually pointed out. 
First,  intellectual  benefits  can  emerge  from  joint  research  projects  between  university  and 

                                                             
1 The importance of the university has been supported by studies based on the analysis of the National 
Innovation Systems, which emphasise the role of the university as an important player in the national 
innovation system because they can affect the creation, development and diffusion of innovations 
(Nelson, 1996; Mowery et al., 2004; Mowery and Sampat, 2005).

firms with industrial applications and knowledge sharing, since linkages with firms may inspire 
new  academic  research  projects  and  provide  new  insights  for  the  research  agenda  (Meyer-
Kramer  and  Schmoch,  1998;  Arza,  2010).  These  benefits  are  particularly  important  in  those 
scientific  fields 
industrial  application  can  advance 
simultaneously, in so-called “Pasteur Quadrant” (Stokes, 1997). Intellectual benefits are one of 
the  most  important  motivations  for  researchers  to  collaborate  with  firms;  even  with 
sometimes commercial channels of interactions, such as spin-off, licensing and patenting, can 
reduce intellectual benefits (Arza and Vazquez, 2010). 

in  which  academic  research  and 

The  second  main  benefit  are  economic  benefits,  which  are  those  benefits  related  to  the 
achievement of extra funding to finance academic research (Arza, 2010) or involves the sharing 
of equipment, material or human resources (Tartari and Breschi, 2012). The access to financial 
and  nonfinancial  resources  is  other  important  factor  encouraging  academic  researchers  to 
increase their collaboration with firms. Moreover, the effect of getting access to financial and 
nonfinancial  resources  increases  if  the  research  group  is  collaborating  to  industrial  partners 
(Tartari and Breschi, 2012). 

Regarding  results  of  the  university-industry  linkages,  collaboration  between  university  and 
industry can often generate important commercial results, since it can bring opportunities to 
develop,  or  co-develop,  inventions  that  can  be  patented,  licensed  or  it  can  generate 
opportunities for academic entrepreneurship, such as spin-offs (Perkmann et al., 2013).  

Other important results from the collaboration with industry are the academic results. When 
academic researchers work together with industry on joint projects, the interaction with  firm 
can usually provide new scientific discoveries. Joint research projects with industrial partners 
often  results  in  academic  publications,  even  with  this  is  less  true  for  different  types  of 
relationship,  such  as  research  contract  and  consulting,  which  consists  in  relationships  with 
more  applied  purposes  (Perkmann  and  Walsh,  2009).  It  is  important  to  point  out  the 
importance of the academic results for the interactive research groups, especially when firms 
interact with high performance research groups. One of the main motivations of the research 
group  on  their  interactions  with  firms  is  that  they  expect  that  there  is  also  some  academic 
result  to  be  derived  from  the  linkage,  especially  those  relates  to  new  scientific  challenges 
(Perkmann et al., 2013). 

Furthermore,  it  is  important  to  mention  that  there  are  important  barriers  that  affect  the 
decision of researchers to interact with industry. Some of them are orientation (or mertonian) 
barriers, since they are related to the main motivations and concerns of academic researchers. 
One of the main characteristics of the community of scientific researchers is the possibility of 
chasing  research  freely  and  according  to  personal  curiosity  (Merton,  1973).  For  academic 
researchers,  engagement with industry  can pose  potential dilemmas related  to  the  different 
institutional  logic  prevailing  in  university  and  industry.  One  of  them  is  the  secrecy  problem, 
which refers to the extent to which interaction with firms could be related to restrictions on 
the  disclosures  of research findings and on the  diffusion of research results, with hazards to 
norms  of  open  science  (Tartari  et  al.,  2012). In  order  to  secure  commercial  appropriation  of 
research results, academics might be require to delay, or even to forego, the publication of the 
results (Perkmann and Walsh, 2009; Brunell et al, 2010; Tartari and Breschi, 2012). In this way, 
academic freedom may be hampering if researchers are encourage to produce research results 
with commercial purposes and to move away from basic research (Mowery et al., 2004). 

The loos of academic freedom and concerns related to the secrecy of the achieved results and 
restrictions  for  diffusion  are  factors  that  can  hamper  the  collaboration  between  academic 
researchers  and  firms  (Tartari  and  Bresch,  2012;  Tartari  et  al.,  2012).  However,  Tartari  and 
Breschi  (2012)  had  shown  that  the  propensity  to  collaborate  with  industry  partners  is  not 
significantly affected by the potential increase in secrecy or by publication delays. In this way, 

 

4 

problems  related  to  secrecy  or  the  diffusion  of  achieved  results  could  not  influence  the 
decision to collaborate with industry. 

Other  important  factor  that  can  hamper  university-industry  linkages  is  the  complementarity 
problem,  related  to  the  lack  of  complementarity  between  industry-related  activities  and 
academic research. Academic researchers might be hindered in their publication purposes by 
the  fact  that  their  projects  with  industry  are  neither  novel  nor  sufficiently  academically 
innovative to warrant publication in academic journals (Perkmann and Walsh, 2009; Tartari et 
al.,  2012).  Skewing  problems  could  also  arise  from  the  collaboration  with  industry,  since 
interaction could impose constrains on academic researchers’ autonomy to establish their own 
research agenda (Tartari et al., 2012). 

Other  set  of  barriers  for  the  collaboration  with  industry  are  transactional  (or  williamson) 
barriers, related to factors that can create noteworthy transactional costs to collaboration to 
industry.  Transactional  costs  often  require  academic  researchers  the  development  of  new 
contractual relationships with their industry partners and the deal with university’s technology 
transfer  offices  (TTO)  and  legal  department  (Tartari  et  al.,  2012).  The  bureaucracy  at  the 
university should also discourage collaboration with firms (Audrestch et al., 2002). Even with 
the university senior management is committed to collaboration with the industry, operational 
levels  may  exacerbate  the  risk  of  interactions  with  firms  and  can  create  barriers  to  the 
collaborative contracts. 

Some  of  the  transaction  barriers  are  related  to  capabilities  barriers,  since  the  lack  of  skills 
among  university  staff,  especially  in  TTO,  may  hamper  the  engagement  of  academic 
researchers  in university-industry  joint projects (Owen-Smith and Powell, 2001;  Tartari et al., 
2012).  At  the  university  side,  underfunded  or  understaffed  TTO  can  produce  long  delays, 
awkward schedules, lax  reporting and negligible  responsiveness to the  concerns of academic 
researchers  in  the  collaboration  process.  At  the  industry  side,  the  lack  of  skilled  R&D  and 
engineering staff may hinder linkages to academic researchers.  

Besides the perceptions of individuals on the effects of the collaboration to industry, there are 
some  characteristics  of  the  research  groups  that  can  be  driving  factors  of  the  interaction 
between  university  and  firms.  One  of  these  factors  is  the  quality  of  academic  research 
performed  by  the  research  groups  (Tornquist  and  Kallsen,  1994;  Abramovsky  et  al.,  2007; 
Mansfield and Lee, 1996; D’Este and Iammarino, 2010; Bishop et al., 2011; Laursen et al., 2011. 
The  main  argument  is  that  higher  performance  universities,  which  accomplish  high  quality 
academic research, are generally more able to transfer knowledge from the university to firms 
because they are able to generate new knowledge with industrial applications (Tornquist and 
Kallsen,  1994).  Academic  excellence  encourages  cooperation,  especially  when  technological 
problems of firms are closer to the state-of-the-art of scientific knowledge (Mansfield and Lee, 
1996). 

Other important factor is the size of the university department, since larger departments tend 
to be more able to interaction with industry (Masfield and Lee, 1996; Schartinger et al., 2001; 
D'Este and Patel, 2007; Perkmann et al., 2011). Schartinger et al. (2001) pointed out that larger 
departments  tend  to  have  wider  human,  physical  and  financial  resources  for  academic 
research  and  a  greater  stock  of  in-depth  scientific  capabilities  and  skills  for  interaction.  An 
additional  factor  that  affects  university-industry  linkages  is  the  size  of  research  teams,  since 
research  group  with  more  technicians  and  researchers  certainly  has  more  accumulated 
capabilities,  which  arises  from  both  previous  research  projects  and  the  experience  of 
interactions with firms (De Fuentes and Dutrénit, 2012). 

The  research  group’s  scientific  field  also  has  an  impact  on  its  interactions  with  industry 
(Meyer-Krahmer  and  Schmoch,  1998;  Bekker  and  Bodas-Freitas,  2008).  Metcalfe  (2003) 
reported that the nature of scientific fields and the manner of the accumulation of knowledge 

 

5 

varied  across  disciplines.  For  example,  he  found  that  engineering  and  applied  technologies 
were disciplines that depend more on "trial and error" accumulation in practical contexts and 
are  focused  on  problem  solving.  Therefore,  research  groups  in  these  disciplines  tend  to 
interact  with  firms more  often  than  groups  in  other basic  sciences.  Schartinger et  al. (2001) 
also showed that research groups from applied technology fields interact with industry more 
than in other disciplines. Stokes’ (1997) Quadrant of Pasteur also corroborates this argument 
because it shows the existence of differences in the application of knowledge among various 
scientific fields, which result in different patterns of interaction with firms and society. 

University-industry  linkages  has  been  a  growing  subject  of  interest  in  Brazil  (Suzigan  et  al., 
2009; Rapini et al., 2009; Fernandes et al., 2010; Suzigan and Albuquerque, 2011; Chaves et al., 
2012). In Brazil, universities have been exerting a greater role in fostering innovation in several 
industries, with notable impacts on the share of several Brazilian firms in international markets 
(Suzigan and Albuquerque, 2011). However, the role of university is particularly important to 
medium and medium-low technology industries, mainly because R&D expenditures of Brazilian 
firms are quite low, especially in high-tech industries (Albuquerque, 2007; Suzigan et al., 2009). 
Moreover, in Brazil academic research often acts as a substitute for firms’ R&D expenditures, 
and sometimes that it also plays a complementary role to in-house R&D (Rapini et al., 2009). 
Regarding the profiles of firms that interacted with Brazilian universities, domestic firms with 
high shares of production in their industries  engaged in more linkages  than did foreign firms 
(Chaves et al., 2012). 

Based on the recognised importance of university-industry linkages, this paper aims to analyse 
how perceptions of academic researchers about the benefits, results and barriers affect their 
interactions  with  firms.  Original  and  comprehensive  data  from  a  survey  with  academic 
research groups that have interactions with firms in Brazil was used. 

 

 

2.  Data description 

In  order  to  exam  how  perceptions  of  academic  research  groups  on  benefits,  results  and 
barriers affect their interactions with firms, data from a survey with Brazilian research groups 
that interact with firms was used. Data was collected in spring 2008 from a  questionnaire to 
the research groups’ leaders from every knowledge fields and from the whole country, which 
had  reported  interactions  with  firms  in  the  2004  Census  Directory  of  Research  Groups  of 
CNPq2. The questionnaires were sent as electronic surveys to 2,151 research groups’ leaders, 
and 1,005 valid responses were received. 

The  information  collected  by  the  questionnaire  comprises  the  main  characteristics  of  the 
research group, such as the numbers of interactions of the research groups, the quantities of 
researchers  and  technicians  in  the  groups  and  their  scientific  fields;  it  also  covered  various 
aspects  related  to  the  interactions  between  research  groups  and  firms,  such  as  types  of 
relationships, information channels and the perceptions of the research group leader using a 
Likert-scale, about benefits, results and barriers of their interactions with firms.  

Besides  main  aspects  related  to  the  characteristics  of  research  groups  and  their  perception 
about  their  interactions,  other  factors  were  considered  such  as  the  quality  of  academic 
research, the size of the research group and the department to which it belongs.

the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology that is dedicated to the promotion and support of 
scientific and technological research.

To  measure  the  quality  of  academic  research,  the  grades  the  Brazilian  governmental  agency 
assigned  to  the  postgraduate  programs  of  the  research  groups  were  used3.  Postgraduate 
programs  and  their  research  groups  that  produced  higher-quality  research,  had  greater 
impacts, and displayed better academic performances received higher grades than did groups 
associated with lower performance. The grade scale ranged from 1 to 7, and the grades 6 and 
7 are assigned to centres that demonstrate worldwide excellence in a certain scientific field. In 
this study, the grades from the period of 2004-2006 were used. The program’s postgraduate 
grade was the indicator chosen because it is comprehensive and comparable and it has been 
used to measure the quality of academic research in several studies on this topic (Abramovsky 
et al., 2007; D'Este and Iammarino, 2010; Laursen et al., 2011)4. 

The size of the departments to which the research groups are linked was also evaluated. Some 
studies, such as Perkmann et al. (2011), have indicated that the size of the department affects 
the  number  of  interactions  a  research  group  has  with  firms.  To  measure  the  sizes  of 
departments,  the  number  of full-time  PhD researchers in the  department was  used5. Finally, 
the  sizes  of  the  research  groups  were  obtained  directly  from  surveys  of  the  universities  and 
were measured by the number of their members. 

The final sample consisted of 612 complete observations of academic research groups. These 
research  groups  belong  to  79  universities  throughout  Brazil,  and  they  participated  in  all 
scientific fields. Together, they develop 2,771 interactions with firms from various industries. 

Regarding to the evaluation of the research groups about the dimensions benefits, results and 
barriers of the interactions of firms, data was collected by using a Likert-scale according to its 
importance: unimportant, slightly, moderately or very important. The dimensions benefits and 
results  could  not  be  clearly  separate.  In  this  way,  it  is  worthy  to  note  that  benefits  can  be 
achieved independently of  the  results, since  an interaction can produce  poor results but  can 
benefit the research group, for example by labor training, by strength knowledge networks or 
by  new  ideas  for  research  projects.  In  accordance  to  the  questionnaire,  it  is  assumed  that 
results are related to the main aims of interactions, such as thesis, publications, new research 
projects  and  scientific  discoveries.  On  the  other  hand,  benefits  are  linked  to  the  interaction 
and the gains related with it, such as additional funding for research, access to lab equipment 
and new ideas for research projects. 

 

3.  Nonparametric IRT 

In  order  to  assess  how  perceptions  of  the  academic  research  about  benefits,  results  and 
barriers  affect  their  interactions  with  firms,  scales  from  the  pattern  of  responses  were 
identified in order to define each of these three analyzed dimensions. 

                                                             
3 The grade is assigned by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES - 
Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior), which is an institution of the Brazilian 
Ministry of Education that is dedicated to regulating higher education in Brazil. Similar to several other 
countries, the evaluation is based on two main factors: the impact of the academic research as 
measured by publications in high impact journals and the training of young researchers. 
4 Nevertheless, it is important to note that the use of this indicator applies only to research groups that 
are linked to postgraduate programs. 
5 The data were obtained from GeoCAPES, the statistical geo-referenced database from CAPES for 2007. 
The size of the department was defined as the total number of researchers in departments associated 
with postgraduate programs of the same Higher Education Institution (HEI) in a CAPES Assessment Area. 
Interdisciplinary programs were excluded because it would have been impossible to associate them with 
specific scientific fields. HEIs were also used for specific units and university campuses that had separate 
departments and at least one postgraduate program.

The  main  aim of this procedure is to reduce  the  amount of items for each dimension, which 
helps  to  avoid  multicollinearity  problems  at  the  econometric  model.  It  also  allows  the 
estimated  model  to  consider  more  adequately  parameters  and  to  provide  appropriate 
estimation  for  the  interpretation  of  the  coefficients.  To  do  that,  a  nonparametric  Item 
Response  Theory  (IRT)  technique  was used. This technique  allows  the  identification of  scales 
(cluster  of  items)  from  the  pattern  of  responses  that  an  individual  produces  through 
questionnaires,  by  generating  ex  post  clusters,  which  avoid  arbitrariness  in  the  selection  of 
groups of variables6. 

The  application  of  nonparametric  IRT  to  data  on  the  dimensions  of  benefits,  results  and 
barriers allows the selection of groups of items that form a coherent scale, since the clustered 
items show adequate level of scalability (H-index), with a significance level of 5%7. The results 
for  each  dimension  are  presented  in  Tables  1-3,  which  show  the  clustered  items  and  its  H-
index.  Tables  also  show  the  number  of  respondents  and  the  share  of  answers  "moderately 
important" and "very important" for each category. 

Application of IRT  for the  items of the  dimension of benefits allows  the identification of  two 
clusters (Table 1). First group are the intellectual benefits, which includes academic and tacit 
benefits such as reputation and networks. The second group comprises the economic benefits, 
by aggregating items related to material or financial obtained from interaction with firms. The 
importance  of  intellectual  benefits, measured by the share of answers “important”, is higher 
than  economic  benefits,  which  can  indicate  that  research  groups  tend  to  realize  as  more 
important the intellectual benefits arising from the interaction.

Clustered  items  for  the  dimension  results  (Table  2)  show  that  two  clusters  are  related  to 
academic  purposes,  knowledge  results  and  academic  results8.  The  third  cluster  is  the 
commercial  results,  which  comprises  items  linked  to  industrial  applications  of  the  results  of 

                                                             
6 In the nonparametric IRT analysis, 'mokken' package from R statistical software was used. Other 
techniques such as Cluster Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) could also be used. 
However, these techniques present some problems, for example, when there is a non-linear relation 
between the items. The non-linearity of the data, even with the use of appropriate correlations 
measures, can result in a mismatch between the model and the data (Ackerman et al., 2003). 
7 Result for the scaling index is also showed in Tables 1-3. The H index is considered strong if it is ≥ 0.5, 
with the lower limit on 0.3 (Mokken, 1971). Results show that all indexes were higher than the lower 
limit and most of the items presents H-index higher than 0.5. So, no items were discarded. 
8 The application of IRT to the scale academic results considers the inclusion of “software” as an 
academic result.

activities  were  considered  more  important  by  the  research  groups,  which  may  indicate  a 
steepening of the researchers to the intellectual results of the interactions with firms.

Finally,  in  the  dimension  barriers,  three  clustered  items  were  found  (Table  3).  Capabilities 
barriers  involves  difficulties  of  research groups  and  firms linked  to  the  lack  of  professionals, 
and capabilities, that can bridge the interest of both firms and university. Orientation barriers 
encompass  differences  in priorities  and deadlines  between firms and university, in the  same 
line  with  the  different  orientation  pointed  out  by  Merton  (1973).  The  third  cluster  is 
transactional  barriers,  which  comprises  a  set  of  factors  regarding  the  formalization  and  the 
legitimation of the interaction between firms and university, what  Tartari et al.  (2012) called 
“williamson barriers”.

The  definition  of  the  main  clusters  for  each  of  the  dimensions  that  affect  collaboration  of 
research  groups  with  firms  allows  a  comparison  to  the  literature  about  the  benefits,  results 
and  barriers  for  university-industry  linkages  (Table  4).  As  could  be  seen,  there  are  many 
authors that analyse the main dimensions that affect the decision of academic researchers to 
collaborate with industry.

After  the  definition  of  the  clusters  of  the  responses  form  research  groups  leaders,  an 
estimated  model  was  built  to  exam  the  effects  of  each  dimension  in  the  interactions  of 
research groups with firms.

4.  Model and Results  

An  estimated  model  was  built  using  the  clusters  formed  by  the  nonparametric  IRT  for  each 
dimension  affecting  interactions  with  industry.  The  main  advantages  of  the  use  of  this 
technique  are  that the  introduction in the  estimated model of the  clusters generated by the 
nonparametric  IRT  can  avoid  multicollinearity  problems.  The  model  relates  the  number  of 
interactions  of  each  research  group  with  the  identified  clusters  of  the  dimensions,  benefits, 
results and barriers; the main driving factors of the decision of research groups to collaborate 
with firms, such as the quality of academic research, the extent of the department and the size 
of research group; and some controls. The variables and their proxies are presented in Table 5.

Regarding  the  main driving factors,  quality of academic research can affect interactions with 
firms. High performance research groups are stimulated to collaborate with firms, since they 
can  provide  solution  to  more  complex  innovation  problems,  especially  when  industrial 
technological efforts are closer to state-of-art scientific knowledge (Mansfield & Lee, 1996). In 
addition,  better  performance  research  groups  are  better  able  to  provide  technological 
solutions  with  industrial  application  (Tornquist  and  Kallsen,  1994).  The  size  of  department is 
other  important  driving  factor  for  research groups  to  collaborate  to  industry  (Mansfield  and 

 

12 

Lee,  1996;  Perkmann  et  al.,  2011).  Larger  departments  have  wider  human,  physical  and 
financial  resources  for  academic  research  and  greater  capabilities  to  interact  with  industry 
(Schartinger  et  al.,  2001).  In  the  same  way,  research  groups  with  more  technicians  and 
researchers are more able to attend industry’s needs (De Fuentes and Dutrénit, 2012). 

In  was  added  to  the  estimated  model  dummy  variables  to  control  scientific  fields,  since  it 
expected  different  patterns  regarding  the  number  of  interactions  according  to  different 
scientific fields.  This assumption is based on the  different roles  of the  scientific disciplines in 
supporting industry innovation, since some areas, such as Engineering, tend to generate more 
applied  knowledge  than  Natural  Sciences  (Meyer-Krahmer  and  Schmoch,  1998;  Metcalfe, 
2003; Bekker and Freitas, 2008). 

In  addition,  other  characteristics  of  the  research  group  that  can  affect  the  number  of 
interactions  were  also  controlled.  The  pattern  of  finance  of  the  research  projects  was  also 
controlled by adding a variable for the share of funding of the research group that came from 
private  firms (Finan). A dummy to control for differences  of research groups linked to Public 
Research Institutes  (PRI)  was  added because  Public Research Institutes  can play  a distinctive 
role in supporting the creation of technological capabilities in developing countries (Mazzoleni 
and Nelson, 2007). Two supplementary  controls were  added for regional characteristics. The 
first  is  a  dummy  for  the  South  and  Southeast  regions  (SSE)  because  the  unequal  regional 
distribution of R&D expenditures among Brazilian regions, that shows that firms in the South 
and Southeast regions have much higher technological activity. The second is the share of the 
manufacturing industry in the total employment of the firm’s region, which is used as a way to 
control the characteristics of the local industrial structure (Manuf).  

Results of the coefficients of the negative binomial regression are presented in Table 6.

The independent variable is the number of interactions the research group reported they have 
with  firms  (Inter).  Five  main  estimations  were  done.  Model  (1)  is  the  baseline  model,  and 
contains only driving factors and controls. Models (2), (3) and (4) comprise the main dimension 
of  the  perceptions  of  academic  researchers  separately.  Finally,  in  model  (5),  full  model  was 
tested.  The  signs  are  consistent  to  the  previous  specification,  and  it is  possible  to  observe  a 
slight increase in R2. As a robustness check, the comparison between previous models and the 
full  model  show  the  quality  of  the  estimators,  since  among  main  results,  both  controls  and 
separately analysed dimensions present no change in the significance of the coefficients.  

 

14 

Regarding  the  main  results,  intellectual  benefits  and  academic  results  present  positive  and 
significant  coefficients,  whereas  transactional  barriers  present  negative  and  significant 
coefficients. 

Regarding  benefits,  intellectual  benefits  positively  affect  research  groups’  interactions  with 
firms.  In  this  way,  it  is  possible  to  conclude  that  factors  such  as  ideas  to  new  collaborative 
projects,  new  ideas  to  research  projects,  knowledge  sharing,  new  networks  relations  and 
reputation positively affect the decision of research groups to collaborate with industry. This 
finding  confirms  previous  research  (Perkmann  and  Walsh,  2009;  Garrett-Jones  et  al.,  2010; 
Arza  and  Vazquez,  2010;  D’Este  and  Perkmann,  2011)  that  shows  the  importance  of 
intellectual  benefits  for  the  research  groups.  It  is  possible  to  ensure  that  collaboration  with 
industry  has  an  important  effect  on  the  development  of  new  research  projects  at  the 
university.  This  reveals  that  collaboration  with  industry  is  often  very  fruitful  for  research 
groups, since through these linkages academic researchers are able to generate new insights 
and ideas for the development of new academic research projects. This means that interaction 
with  industry  is  able  to  bring  new  research  questions  to  the  university.  Furthermore, 
interaction  with  industry  is  also  able  to  bring  new  ideas  for  new  cooperative  projects  with 
industry.  This  reveals  an  important  feature  of  the  collaboration  projects  of  research  groups 
with firms, since these relationships are established from a maturation process between both 
agents and often result from a long-term relationship. 

As  regards  to  economic  benefits,  coefficients  are  not  significant.  This  result  shows  that  no 
relation can be found between the number of interactions and the economic benefits, such as 
joint  use  of  equipment  labs,  inputs  for  research  and  financial  resources.  This  finding  differs 
from other studies, such as Tartari and Breschi (2012), which shows that obtaining resources is 
one  of  the  main  motivators  of  the  collaboration  with  firms.  However,  this  could  mean  that 
academic  researchers  give  more 
intellectual  benefits  that  arise  from 
collaboration  with  firms  than  economic  ones,  which  means  that  intellectual  benefits  often 
overcome financial assistance related to interactions to firms (Fernandes et al., 2010).  

importance  for 

Concerning  results,  academic results also positively  affect the  decision of research groups to 
collaborate  with  industry.  This  finding  shows  that  researchers  consider  important  academic 
results that emerge from collaboration with firms, such as training of researchers, theses and 
dissertations, publications and software, tend to interact more with industrial partners. This is 
evidence  that  collaboration  with  industry  can  generate  relevant  academic  results,  and  that 
university-industry  linkages  cannot deviate  university from its  main  mission to generate  new 
knowledge.  Publications  in  journals  and  theses  and  dissertations  are  the  primary  way  of 
disclosure  of results from  academic research, which means that collaboration with industrial 
partners can generate new knowledge that will become academic product. 

On  the  other  hand,  knowledge  results  and  commercial  results  present  no  significant 
coefficients.  This  means  that  academic  researchers  that  interact  more  with  firms  tend  to 
consider  academic  results  more  important  than  knowledge  results,  such  as  new  scientific 
discoveries and new research projects, and commercial results, such as new products, patents 
or academic entrepreneurship. However, findings show that interaction with firms can provide 
new  publications,  thesis  and  dissertations,  in  a  clear  demonstration  that  knowledge  sharing 
between university and industry can provide new scientific knowledge, and so, publication in 
academic journals.  D'Este  and Perkmann (2011)  also found  positive effect of the  motivations 
for  learning  in  interactions  of  academic  groups,  which  means  that  the  search  for  academic 
results  are  important  motivators  for  researcher  groups  to  perform  more  interactions  with 
companies.  

Finally, results also show that transactional barriers have a negative effect on the number of 
interactions  of  research  groups.  This  result  suggests  that  research  groups  that  have  more 

 

15 

collaboration  with  industrial  partners  presents  lower  complaining  on  transactional  barriers, 
such  as  bureaucracy  both  at  university  and  in  the  firm,  costs  of  the  contracts,  intellectual 
property  rights  and  geographical  distance.  This  means  that  research  groups  that  collaborate 
more with firms can develop capabilities to manage the contracts and to deal with university 
bodies. However, this could also suggest that there is a task for the university’s TTO in order to 
stimulate and the simplify operation to formalize collaboration between university and firms. 

In  addition,  orientation  barriers  do  not  present  significant  coefficient,  as  well  as  capabilities 
barriers. This could indicate that, among Brazilian research groups that interact with industry 
there  cannot  be  found  orientation  (or  mertonian)  problems,  related  to  the  different 
institutional  logic  prevailing  in  university  and  firms.  This  means  that  research  groups 
interacting with firms are able to establish collaborative projects with industrial partners and it 
does  not  hinder  the  university's  mission  of  generating  new  knowledge  and  its  publication  in 
high  impact  journals.  This  finding  is  convergent  to  Tartari  and  Breschi  (2012),  which  have 
shown  that  the  potential  increase  in  secrecy  and  publication  delays  does  not  affect  the 
propensity of academic researchers to collaborate with industry. 

In relation to the main driving factors of the interaction of research groups with firms, quality 
of  academic  research  presents  positive  and  significant  coefficient.  This  means  that  better-
performing  research  groups  interact  more  with  firms,  which  shows  that  more  collaborative 
research between universities and industry can be found among research groups with higher 
quality academic research. The size of the department also has a positive effect on the number 
of  interactions  of  research  groups,  which  means  that  research  groups  linked  to  larger 
departments  were  better  able  to  interact  with  firms.  Concerning  the  size  of  the  research 
group,  the  larger  the  research  groups are,  the  more they  tend  to  interact  with  firms.  Larger 
research  groups  are  better  able  to  handle  broader  and,  in  several  cases,  more  diversified, 
academic skills, which improves their ability to interact with firms. 

Regarding the main controls, the dummy for Public Research Institutes also presents positive 
and significant coefficients, which shows the important role played by these institutions in the 
building of new capabilities in developing countries (Mazzoleni and Nelson, 2007). Moreover, 
dummies for scientific fields also present significant coefficients, which show different patterns 
of interaction with industry among research groups’ scientific fields. 

 

5.  Final remarks and policy implications 

The main aim of this paper was to analyse how perceptions of academic researchers about the 
benefits, results and barriers affect their interactions with firms. The main assumption of the 
paper is that university has become a growing source of information and knowledge for firms’ 
innovation, which result in an increase of the importance of university-industry linkages. In this 
way, an important question regarding this subject is what drives academic research to interact 
with industrial partners. In this way, by analysing benefits and results of the interactions with 
firms and  the  effect  of  the  main  barriers  to  engagement  with industry,  this  paper  adds  new 
contribution on the  understanding of the main motivations and constrains faced by research 
groups in the collaboration with firm. 

Main  findings  of  the  paper  show  three  main  points.  First,  intellectual  benefits  from  the 
collaboration with industrial partners, such as ideas to new cooperative project, new ideas to 
research projects, information and knowledge sharing, new network relations, and reputation, 
positively affect interactions of research groups with firms. Second, academic results, such as 
publications, thesis and dissertation, training of researchers, and software, are also drivers of 
the  interactions  between  research  groups  and  firms.  Third,  and  on  the  other  hand, 
transactional  barriers,  such  as  bureaucracy  in  university  and  in  firms,  costs,  intellectual

property rights and geographical distance, play an important role to discourage researchers to 
interact more with industrial partners. 

These  findings  were  found  by  using  of  the  nonparametric  IRT  technique,  which  allows  the 
formation  of  non-arbitrary  clusters  of  the  perceptions  of  the  research  groups  about  the 
benefits,  results  and  barriers  to  collaborate  with  firms.  These  clusters  were  used  in  the 
econometric model, which allowed the estimation of a model that sought to assess how these 
dimensions affect their interactions to firms, even controlling other driving factors, such as the 
quality of academic research, the size of the group and the scientific field. 

Main  findings  can  add  new  questions  on  the  literature  about  university-industry  linkages. 
Results show  that  interactions with firms can also be  a driver for intellectual benefits of the 
research groups that collaborate with industrial partners, since interactions with firms can also 
provide  intellectual  benefits  for  academic  researchers.  Results  show  that  ideas  to  new 
scientific  projects  and  the  exchange  of  information  and  knowledge  are  important  benefits 
related  to  the  collaboration  with  firms.  This  conclusion  is  strengthen  by  other  finding  that 
shows  that  orientation  barriers  were  not  significant,  which  means  that  cannot  be  found 
orientation  problems  among  Brazilian  research  groups  that  interacts  with  firms.  Academic 
results  are  also  important  drivers  for  research  groups  in  their  collaboration  with  firms.  This 
finding show that collaboration with industrial partner can also provide academic results, such 
as  publications,  theses  and  dissertation,  which  also  shows  that  linkages  with  industry  can 
strengthen academic activities and provide inputs for academic disclosure. 

Finally,  findings  can  also  provide  policy  implications.  First,  related  to  the  importance  of 
intellectual benefits and academic results, it is clear that policy measures toward to stimulate 
university-industry linkages can not only not hinder academic activity, but also can strengthen 
the  capacity of research groups to generate  academic  outcomes  such as publications, theses 
and dissertations. Second, since transactional barriers have a negative effect to the number of 
interactions  of  research  groups,  policy  measures  should  try  to  simplify  procedures  and 
increase transparency on the contracts with firms. This is a task also to university TTO, since it 
can be an important channel to stimulate cooperation with industrial partners.
