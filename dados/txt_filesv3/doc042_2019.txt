Abstract

This work aims to estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model (DSGE) to evaluate the
impact of microeconomic uncertainty shocks in the Brazilian economy. The microeconomic shocks
emerge from the interaction with a continuum of entrepreneur agents and the ﬁnancial sector. Calibrating
the model using quarterly data from 2003 to 2017, we ﬁnd that agency costs in the entrepreneurial and
ﬁnancial sector impact economic growth, capital accumulation and household’s welfare.

1 Introduction

This is a research in the ﬁeld of macroeconomics that aims to provide a deeper understanding of
economic uncertainty in Brazil. This work addresses the question of the importance of microeconomic
uncertainty shocks in the Brazilian economy. Macroeconomists gained interest and acquired a deeper
understanding of the role of ﬁrms and individuals in the performance of economies, and nowadays mi-
croeconomic elements are increasingly ubiquitous in structural and dynamic macroeconomic models. In
example, microeconomic elements can be inserted in such models in form of a large number of ﬁrms or
agents (instead of a single, representative agent) that need not be homogeneous, interacting in competitive
or monopolistic markets. The result of the aggregate economy will emerge from market clearing and other
equilibrium conditions. This strategy turns possible to answer more intricate questions in economic policy,
without leaving the general equilibrium framework.

More than investigating the impacts of microeconomic shocks itself, we turn our attention to microe-
conomic uncertainty shocks. In this work, following the existing literature, we interpret such shocks as
perturbations to the ﬁrms’ expectation about the return of their investments. In other terms, think of a statis-
tical distribution of ﬁrm outputs: rather than shocks to the mean, this work focuses on shocks to the standard
deviation of the distribution. In reality, the production decision of ﬁrms can be affected by a multitude of

factors: economic, administrative, political. In our model economy, ﬁrms respond to ﬂuctuations in own
idiosyncratic shocks, macroeconomic policy shocks, input prices and loan interest rates.

Recent work in the real business cycle theory (JUSTINIANO; PRIMICERI, 2008; BORN; PFEIFER,
2014) focuses on time-varying dispersion effects in aggregate variables, and ﬁndings from Christiano, Motto
and Rostagno (2014) suggest that microeconomic uncertainty shocks are as important as the traditional
technology and policy shocks as a source of business cycle ﬂuctuations, meaning that such elements must
be incorporated in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models used by policy makers. In this
work, we will focus on microeconomic shocks as a source of economic growth uncertainty. This research
departs from the view that evaluate how the standard economic policy shocks affect business cycles. In the
context of DSGE models, microeconomic uncertainty shocks are introduced by adding agents or ﬁrms that
face uncertainty about their output, and such uncertainty need not show strong correlation with the usual
aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) shocks, and we follow this deﬁnition.

Empirical evidence on the subject is largely devoted to the United States economy. The matter of
economic uncertainty received greater attention since the work of Lucas (1988). Beginning in the mid
1980’s, the U.S. economy began to experience a phenomenon called the Great Moderation, which was an
abrupt decline in the volatility of gross domestic product growth. The causes of the Great Moderation were
at the center of a long debate, and Stock and Watson (2003) argue that while efﬁcient monetary policy
helped diminish output volatility, about half of the reduction in volatility remained unexplained. One of the
purposes of this work is to bring this knowledge to discuss symptoms and causes of economic uncertainty
in Brazil.

Figure 1 presents the Economic Policy Uncertainty 1 monthly index, proposed by Baker, Bloom and
Davis (2013), from January 1990 to October 2017. Moving averages were calculated to smooth out the
series, using a 12-month window. Data shows the effects of 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, political turmoils and
a recent comparison between Brazil, U.S. and European countries. The index is based on political news
coverage, stock market ﬂuctuations and disagreements among forecasters about future economic growth.
While the index is not a direct proxy for microeconomic uncertainty, it gives an overview of instabilities
faced by the economies. Data shows the effects of the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis and recent political turmoils, in
all sets of countries examined (impeachment and economic recession in Brazil, the latest elections in the
U.S., Brexit in Europe).

The matter of economic uncertainty gained momentum on the macroeconomics research agenda, in
the last ten years, due to the latest ﬁnancial crisis. As noted by Castro (2016, p. 4), in the aftermath of
the crisis, Brazil “adopted a new regime, with public banks stepping in strongly in the credit markets to
offset the retraction in private banks’ credit origination”. Some of the ﬁndings in the literature and lessons
learned from recent ﬁnancial crises materialized in the form of macroprudential policies and regulations,

credit default swaps (i.e., the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States)2. Recently, the literature on economic
uncertainty advanced when studies turned their attentions to two facts. First, beyond many analyses on
aggregate GDP growth volatility, researchers started looking at the microeconomic level. This includes
sector and ﬁrm-level data.

2 Theoretical reference

The real business cycles literature emphasizes the role of ﬂuctuations in key macroeconomic variables
for economic growth and development, such as government spending, taxation, interest and inﬂation rates.
Also, the role of technological progress and human capital have been widely discussed. Since the seminal
work of Kydland and Prescott (1982), the framework has been reﬁned, with the addition of consumption
habits, investment adjustment costs, different ﬁscal and monetary policy rules.

Recently, the role of uncertainty in economic activity has received greater attention (BLOOM, 2014;
BAKER; BLOOM; DAVIS, 2013). The development of more sophisticated estimation techniques (such as
Bayesian methods) made it possible to study the dynamic behavior of economic variables not only in its
ﬁrst but also second moments. Despite the mixed evidence on the issue of volatility-growth correlation, one
of the goals of policy makers is to smooth out deviations from long-term, sustainable economic growth (i.e.
monetary policy rules). This research agenda is especially relevant for emerging economies such as Brazil,
because the business cycles are more volatile.

In the baseline real business cycles models, ﬁnancial markets are set aside, with the underlying as-
sumption that ﬁnancial ﬂuctuations do not affect real economic aggregates. However, Bernanke, Gertler
and Gilchrist (1999) point out that, in fact, credit market shocks are not only a consequence but can also
cause stress in the real economy. Evidence coming from the ﬁnancial crises in the 1990’s (Southeast Asian
Tigers, Russia, Latin American countries) helped popularize this element in small and medium-sized mod-
els. Hence, our theoretical approach embodies the strand of the macroeconomic literature of dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium models including ﬁnancial sector as a source (or ampliﬁer) of business cy-
cles.

While there is, to the best of our knowledge, no evidence with respect to microeconomic uncertainty
shocks, as we speciﬁed, for the Brazilian economy, there is evidence for the impact of ﬁnancial frictions
on Brazil’s business cycles, which is the key transmission mechanism of entrepreneurial uncertainty. With
a model based on Gerali et al. (2010), Aranha (2012) ﬁnds important evidence for Brazil: (i) a reduction
in credit market frictions (measured by bank spreads and adjustment costs) results in an increase in in-
vestment, consumption and GDP; and (ii) while those frictions help keeping banking spreads high, they
have a negative impact on inﬂation rates. Kanczuk (2013) extends the Smets and Wouters (2007) model,
incorporating credit markets for households and ﬁrms, to show how macroprudential policies can affect the
Brazilian economy. Castro (2016) also focused on the topic, with a model that combines ﬁnancial frictions
and foreign capital ﬂows, that is, direct investment as dependent of sovereign risk, to establish if ﬁscal pol-
icy should react to credit cycles. The authors suggest that this is only the case if macroprudential policies
are independent and counter-cyclical.

Now, we discuss microeconomic shocks as a source of business cycles. This hypothesis states that
shocks in productivity or sales, at ﬁrm or sector level, lead to aggregate output ﬂuctuations, providing a
microeconomic foundation to the real business cycles. However, this argument departs from the assumption
that aggregate shocks are the result of an average of identical ﬁrms or sectors. In fact, empirical evidence
from Gabaix and Society (2011), studying the U.S. economy, shows that the distribution of ﬁrm sizes
is skewed. Hence, exogenous shocks to large ﬁrms should account for a non-negligible amount of the
business cycles. The author calls it the “granular hypothesis”. This is a potential evidence for developing

countries, as anecdotal evidence suggests that such economies have greater sectoral concentration, so one
could expect this hypothesis to have greater explanatory power.

Acemoglu et al. (2012) reﬁne the previous argument. The authors argue that microeconomic shocks
lead to aggregate ﬂuctuations through input-output relationships. This happens because productivity gains
propagate along supply chains and generate spillovers to the whole economy. We call it the “network
hypothesis”. The hypothesis, corroborated by the authors using U.S. input-output data, also states that
microeconomic shocks translate into aggregate volatility “if there are signiﬁcant asymmetries in the roles
that sectors play as direct or indirect suppliers to others” (ACEMOGLU et al., 2012, p. 2004). Both the
granular and the network hypotheses interact in the sense that large ﬁrms and markets have an important
contribution to the business cycles. More papers emphasize the network characteristic of modern economies
as a transmitter of economic ﬂuctuations. Carvalho (2014) study the production networks using U.S. input-
output data and shows that indeed the productivity in central sectors of the economy and GDP growth are
strongly correlated. These “central” sectors act like hubs: they provide simple inputs (e.g.: raw materials)
that ﬁrms from other sectors can resort to, in the event of a break in supply chains.

2.1 The role of ﬁnance

Bernanke and Gertler (1995) summarize how credit markets can amplify effects of monetary policy.
The external ﬁnance premium is the difference between raising capital from internal (reinvesting proﬁts)
and external (i.e; equity markets) sources.

This premium, which is counter-cyclical, can be affected via two channels. First, the balance sheet
channel: if entrepreneurs have greater net worth, they can self-ﬁnance investment projects partially or com-
pletely, or offer a higher amount of collateral as a guarantee, diminishing the external ﬁnance premium.
Thus, the ﬁnancial position of borrowers should affect the premium. Also, consider the position of borrow-
ers after loan contracts are celebrated. If loans are negotiated at current, post-ﬁxed interest rates, monetary
policy shocks affect the ﬁrms balance sheets in the short term. Now, ﬁrms reconsider taking new loans,
expanding the external ﬁnance premium and depressing investment. Via this mechanism, policy shocks
may have long-term effects.

Second, the bank lending channel predicts that banks will also experience a balance sheet effect in
response to interest rate adjustments. According to Bernanke and Gertler (1995), while the plausibility of
the balance sheet channel is well understood, the bank lending channel is controversial, because ﬁnancial
liberalization can diminish bank lending channel effects, as banks can offer new, less insured products.

Economic policy uncertainty can also inﬂuence business cycles. Chi and Li (2017) analyze the impact
of swings in economic policy uncertainty on banks loans in China. They regress loan amounts on an
economic policy uncertainty index and banking sector controls, concluding that greater policy uncertainty
causes a reduction in quantity and size of loans, as they perceive increased risk, and this result is more
pronounced in ﬁnancially less-developed areas. Moreover, the effect is, as expected, different if banks
are private, state-owned or have mixed ownership. As a policy recommendation, they advocate for better
coordination between commercial banks and the monetary policy authority as a means of smoothing credit
supply. Valencia (2017) also shows that, in moments of greater uncertainty, banks adjust their capital-
to-assets ratio, which varies according to the bank size, presenting a mechanism of self-insurance. This
suggests that, in aggregate terms, the impact of this channel, depends on the relevance of small and big
banks. And how does the structure of the banking sector affect economic ﬂuctuations? Larrain (2006) ﬁnds
that greater access to banks contributes to a reduction in the volatility of industrial production: ﬁrms incur
short-term loans to smooth output, in response to demand and inventory shocks. Thus, banks have a counter-
cyclical effect on uncertainty shocks. Huang, Fang and Miller (2014) show that a highly concentrated
banking market correlates with greater industrial growth volatility. However, a more concentrated banking
sector can be beneﬁcial to sectors highly dependent on external liquidity. Furthermore, Fendo˘glu and Fendo
(2017) ﬁnds that in emerging countries monetary policy tools based on domestic reserve requirements are
helpful to counterbalance foreign capital inﬂows, and therefore preferred by the economic policy authorities.

In the context of DSGE models, examples of uncertainty/risk as discussed by Pindyck (1991) are
explicit in time-to-build models (KYDLAND; PRESCOTT, 1982; JUNG, 2013). In this class of models, a
representative agent commits to an investment project that matures many periods ahead. A result supported
by the literature is that the longer the “time to build” an investment project, the more uncertain it is, and
larger spreads of the investment rate of return with respect to the risk-free rates are required. This is
aggravated if there are costs to stop and restart projects. Also, as pointed out by the author, a decrease in
interest rates need not beneﬁt long-term investments, because it also reduces capital costs for other projects.
In turn, Aiyagari (1994) focus on a precautionary savings motive, combined with borrowing con-
straints. The author presents an example model where a continuum of agents are subject to random labor
endowment shocks. In this case, uncertainty emerges from the productive process. Because markets are
incomplete and agents try to smooth consumption, they accumulate capital. Thus, in face of greater uncer-
tainty agents increase aggregate savings (which we interpret as investment, because of the macroeconomic
identity). The author points that earlier studies relied on the pure bequest motive as an explanation to
inter-generational capital accumulation, but precautionary savings presents as a relevant explanation, with
emphasis on lower income households.

In a survey of U.S. and German ﬁrms, Elstner et al. (2012) ﬁnd that uncertainty proxies based on
survey data account for a greater share of output volatility than stock market based proxies. Also, they
present interesting evidence: both countries exhibit slightly different output dynamics in response to an
uncertainty shock. While in the U.S. shocks have high persistence, in Germany shocks have a pattern of
decline followed by quick recovery, called by the authors a “bust-boom cycle”. According to the Elstner
et al. (2012) and Bachmann and Bayer (2013), this provides evidence of slightly higher cost of factor
adjustments, that is, in moments of greater uncertainty ﬁrms prefer to postpone investments and observe the
behavior of their competitors. Overall, the works of Bachmann suggests that in these countries the effects of
“wait-and-see” dynamics on ﬁrm-level risk are small. However, the presence of labor regulations and capital
constraints in Brazil result in greater factor adjustment costs (in comparison to developed economies). This
suggests that investment dynamics and “wait-and-see” behavior could provide a sound theoretical argument
to explain some of the effects of microeconomic uncertainty shocks in the Brazilian economy.

The microeconomic uncertainty shocks we will discuss in this work are closely related to the ability
of entrepreneurs to thrive. Therefore, we must discuss the ease of doing business in Brazil. In general,
while Brazil supports a free enterprise economy, there is extensive government intervention and regulation,
which manifests in the form of: (i) permits and obligations with federal, state and municipality entities; (ii)
an extensive tax code that ﬁrms must comply with. According to the World Bank’s 2017 Ease of Doing
Business index, Brazil is ranked at 123rd place, among 190 countries in the sample. Brazil is poorly ranked
especially when it comes to starting a business, paying taxes and dealing with foreign trade. We expect that
these difﬁculties affect both the expected rate of survival of small business ventures and their variability,
because entrepreneurs must evaluate both the macroeconomic expectations and immediate obligations when
starting a business.

2.2 Discussion of microeconomic uncertainty shocks

In this section we will discuss the origins of microeconomic uncertainty shocks. First, we will discuss
what are the conditions that favour the emergence of such shocks. microeconomic uncertainty shocks are
commonly attributed to heterogeneities in ﬁrms’ productive processes and outcomes, that are subject to
ﬂuctuations. It is known that credit market imperfections exist, and they can amplify the effect of the un-
certainty shocks in the aggregate economy (GERTLER; KIYOTAKI, 2010) due to an information problem,
because lenders do not observe the realized shock from borrowers. This phenomenon is called the “costly
state veriﬁcation problem” (TOWNSEND, 1979). This is an essential theoretical element, because in the
absence of credit constraints, there is no wedge in banks’ zero proﬁt condition, providing us evidence that
any proxy variable for microeconomic uncertainty shocks must be correlated with ﬁnancial markets (and
not exogenously in production, in example).

The proxy for microeconomic uncertainty shocks should contain a few important properties. First,
is must be counter-cyclical, according to empirical evidence (BAKER; BLOOM; DAVIS, 2013). Second,
according to Cesa-Bianchi and Fernandez-Corugedo (2014), the proxy should be able to indirectly generate
ﬂuctuations aggregate in output, consumption, investment and labor, based on evidence from Christiano,
Motto and Rostagno (2014). Having all that said, it is admittedly difﬁcult to obtain a deﬁnitive measure
of economic uncertainty: ﬁrstly because it derives from a multitude of factors, such as economic condi-
tions, agents’ perception and behavior, and secondly because it is necessary to adopt some deﬁnition of
uncertainty, and any choice may lead to different strands of literature and empirical results. Also, there
are empirical limitations. According to Ludvigson, Ma and Ng (2015, p. 16), “common uncertainty prox-
ies contain economically large components of their variability that do not appear to be generated by a
movement in genuine uncertainty across the broader economy”. We stick to the knightian deﬁnition of un-
certainty, namely the difﬁculty of agents to forecast the probability of occurrence of all possible outcomes
from a set of events (and histories).

The works of Nicholas Bloom investigate the relationship between uncertainty and economic per-
formance in greater detail. An important remark of the author is that “(...) uncertainty also appears to
endogenously increase during recessions, as lower economic growth induces greater micro and macro un-
certainty” (BLOOM, 2014, p. 153). Studying the U.S. economy, Bloom (2014) deﬁnes stylized facts for
economic uncertainty: (i) macroeconomic uncertainty rises in recessions. That is, the volatility of almost
all key economic indicators rises in recessions; (ii) microeconomic uncertainty also rises in recessions. The
author states this fact based on data from ﬁrms and industrial production. Volatility rises in the sense that
– in more uncertain times – some sectors go better than others. Bloom (2014) also points out that this facts
are not restricted to the U.S. economy, as the same economic rationale is also found in global economies,
and impacts are even more intense in developing countries such as Brazil.

Now, we present each of the proposed measures of microeconomic uncertainty, drawing from the
literature, to a posterior comparison. All time series are seasonally adjusted, and ﬁrst differences are taken
at any sign of unit roots.

Uncertainty evaluation based on the productivity of ﬁrms is the most commonly found in the literature
(ELSTNER et al., 2012; CHUGH, 2013; CHRISTIANO; IKEDA, 2013; CHRISTIANO; MOTTO; ROS-
TAGNO, 2014). It is a known fact that the distribution of ﬁrm sales changes from times of economic growth
to recessions, as the average goes down and the dispersion goes up (BLOOM, 2014). Publicly available
ﬁrm-level data of private companies in Brazil are scarce. As a proxy variable, we use the moving standard
deviation of monthly industry sales in the state of São Paulo, produced by FIESP (Federação das Indústrias
do Estado de São Paulo).

Since economic uncertainty is understood as a result of multiple factors, some authors and entities
proposed composite indices that can be used as a proxy for microeconomic uncertainty shocks. First, we
consider the Economic Policy Uncertainty3 (EPU) monthly index, proposed by Baker, Bloom and Davis
(2013). The index is based on political news coverage, stock market ﬂuctuations and disagreements among
forecasters about future economic growth. The index have interesting properties: ﬁrst, the selection of news
coverage is statistically resistant to “media political bias”. This was tested by comparing two subsamples
of newspapers segregated by political orientation. While the EPU index is primarily oriented to measure
economic policy uncertainty (that is, shifts in ﬁscal and monetary policy) that refers to macroeconomic
uncertainty, it contains useful elements for the study of microeconomic uncertainty shocks.

In Brazil, there is a similar effort, namely the IIE-Br (Índice de Incerteza Econômica) index, devel-
oped by IBRE/FGV. In a similar manner to Baker, Bloom and Davis (2013), the IIE-Br index is a weighted
average of three components:

IIEt = 0.7∗ IIEmedia + 0.2∗ IIEexpectations + 0.1∗ IIEmarket

(1)

IIEmedia is based on the frequency of news mentioning keywords such as “uncertainty”, “crisis”, “risk”
in Brazilian main newspapers4; IIEexpectations is built upon measures of disagreement among forecasters
with respect to exchange and inﬂation rates (data available in Brazilian Central Bank FOCUS reports) and
IIEmarket is based on the volatility of Ibovespa, the Brazilian stock market index. The IIE-Br index is
standardized such that it has mean 100 and standard deviation 10 in the last ten years.

3 Analytical model

To evaluate the role of microeconomic uncertainty shocks in business cycles in Brazil, we present
a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model based on Dorofeenko, Lee and Salyer (2008). This is a
model of a closed economy with a ﬁnancial sector based on Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997). The key actors
of the model are the entrepreneurs, which produce ﬁnished capital goods and are subject to production
uncertainty and interact with banks to ﬁnance their activities. This interaction between entrepreneurs and
banks will be the source of shocks that emerge from the ﬁnancial sector and affect the real economy.
Equity markets are absent from the modeled ﬁnancial sector, hence debt is the only source of external
ﬁnance. We enhance the model by adding ﬁscal and monetary policy, in order to evaluate the impacts
of economic policy shocks in our model economy. The main variable of interest is St, the time-varying
standard deviation of microeconomic uncertainty shocks. Innovations to St allow for the dispersion of the
shocks to change over time. The fundamentals of this model resemble a standard real business cycles (RBC)
model, with the addition of ﬁnancial market imperfections. The model incorporates the idea of the “ﬁnancial
accelerator”, which brings the external ﬁnance premium to investment dynamics. The relationship between
entrepreneurs and banks are the key aspect behind microeconomic uncertainty shocks. Also, the ﬁnancial
accelerator described above depends on costly state veriﬁcation, that introduces information asymmetries
between ﬁnancial parties.

An overview of the model follows. Figure 2 shows all the interactions between agents, in terms of the
ﬂows of inputs, outputs and goods. In the center of the diagram are the agents directly involved in the ﬁnan-
cial frictions, that according to the theoretical framework amplify the microeconomic uncertainty shocks
throughout the economy. There is a continuum of agents distributed in the (0,1) interval, divided between
households and entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs represent a fraction η of the economy, while households rep-
resent a fraction 1− η. To ﬁnance their activities, they interact with ﬁnancial intermediaries called capital
mutual funds (CMF) in Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997), which in here we simply refer as banks. In addition,
there are ﬁrms that employ capital, household and entrepreneurial labor to produce a ﬁnal, homogeneous
good, and their productivity is subject to exogenous shocks.

Here, we deﬁne the ﬁnancial contract and its optimal conditions. We follow the speciﬁcation of the
contract in Dorofeenko, Lee and Salyer (2008). Financial contracts are one-period loans celebrated by two
parties:

• Entrepreneurs: Risk-neutral agents that ﬁnance investment project combining internal (their own net

worth) and external (loans from banks) resources.

• Banks: Risk-neutral ﬁnancial intermediaries that operate in perfect competition. Banks collect re-
sources from entrepreneurs when they: (i) go bankrupt; (ii) repay loans and (iii) buy capital from
entrepreneurs willing to increase consumption.

In every period, entrepreneurial productivity is subject to an exogenous shock ωt. The realization of
this shock at time t is known only by entrepreneurs – banks must pay a fraction µ of the investment to
observe the entrepreneurs’ productivity. That is, they invest an amount it in capital goods with an expected
return of ωtit. This productivity shock follows a log-normal distribution with mean one: ωt ∼ log N (1,St).

Shocks to the dispersion of entrepreneurial productivity, although mean-preserving, increase uncertainty
about entrepreneurs’ productivity, thus increasing the probability of bankruptcy Φ(ω,St) (which will be
later deﬁned) and changing the conditions of the ﬁnancial contract:

An entrepreneur has one unit of labor that is always supplied and zt units of capital at time t. Capital
can be rented to ﬁrms at a rate of return rt. Hence, entrepreneurial income is nt + rtzt. Also accounting for
capital depreciation, net worth at time t is deﬁned by the equation:

nt = wt + zt(rt + qt(1− δ ))

This leads us to two possible scenarios:

1. ωt ≥ ¯ωt: The entrepreneur produces ωtit units of capital and pays back (1 + rk)(it − nt) to banks.
2. ωt < ¯ωt: The entrepreneur goes bankrupt and the bank will take all assets, upon facing monitoring

costs µ.

We should now deﬁne the shared of capital production to be distributed to entrepreneurs and banks:

ωφ ( ¯ωt,St)dω + [1− Φ( ¯ωt,St)] ¯ωt − µΦ( ¯ωt,St)

where f ( ¯ωt,St) is the share of capital output obtained by the entrepreneur and m( ¯ωt,St) is the share re-
ceived by banks. Note the integrands: while f ( ¯ωt,St) is calculated above the threshold shock, m( ¯ωt,St) is
calculated below the shock. We also have the property that f ( ¯ωt,St) + m( ¯ωt,St) = 1− µΦ( ¯ωt,St).

The optimal ﬁnancial contract is a choice of investment and a threshold productivity shock that gives
the entrepreneur maximum return, once banks are willing to offer such resources (an incentive compatibility
constraint). Deﬁning Φ( ¯ωt,St) as the cumulative distribution function of ωt and φ ( ¯ωt,St) as its probability
distribution function, the optimal contract is the solution to the optimization problem:

{it , ¯ωt}qtit f ( ¯ωt,St)

The second equilibrium condition can also be rewritten as:

1− qtm( ¯ωt,St)

(13)

Let’s examine the properties of this investment model. We can interpret Equation 13 as the aggregate
investment supply function, decreasing in the price of capital qt and increasing in net worth nt, while ¯ωt
is uniquely deﬁned by Equation 12, once we set ¯ωt and St as ﬁxed in our comparative statics exercise.
Since Equation 13 is linear in its arguments, simple aggregation is possible. To answer how microeconomic
uncertainty shocks affect investment demand, note that in Equation 13 a rise in ¯ωt implies a rise in m( ¯ωt,St),
leading to a fall in it, ceteris paribus.

Now, we move on to a detailed description of the agents of the model. Households are risk-neutral and
have inﬁnite life. They interact with ﬁrms by selling labor (in exchange of wages wt) and renting capital (at
a rate rt). Following Dorofeenko, Lee and Salyer (2008), we choose a simple quasi-linear functional form
for household utility. Households maximize the discounted sum of lifetime expected utility, by choosing the
sequence of allocations of the ﬁnal consumption good and leisure {ct,lt}∞
t=0 starting from the information
set at time t = 0, according to the problem:

(15)
(16)
where β ∈ (0,1) is the discount factor, ν is the elasticity of labor, wt is the real wage, rt is the capital rental
rate and kt is the capital stock, qt is the price of capital goods, it is the ﬂow of new capital goods and Tt
are lump-sum transfers to the government. The price of the ﬁnal consumption good is normalized to unity.
The second constraint is a standard law of motion for the households’ capital stock, with a depreciation rate
δ ∈ (0,1). To solve the constrained optimization problem above, we plug the second constraint into the ﬁrst
and form a Lagrangian. The ﬁrst order conditions are:

νct = wt
qt

(18)

The resulting equilibrium gives relationships that are standard in the literature of RBC models: the
ﬁrst condition states that the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and consumption equals real
wages, while the second is the Euler equation, that describes household consumption dynamics.

Firms combine capital, household and entrepreneurial labor to produce the ﬁnal consumption good,

using a constant returns-to-scale Cobb-Douglas technology according to the equation:

their consumption is deﬁned after the returns from investment are realized. This is necessary in order to
prevent a scenario where entrepreneurs accumulate enough capital to ﬁnance their projects entirely with
internal resources 6.

We introduce economic policy in the model, starting with ﬁscal policy. There is a government that
consumes ﬁnal goods and ﬁnance expenditures via lump-sum transfers from households. Hence, ricardian
equivalence holds every period. Government consumption follows a ﬁrst-order autoregressive process:

(27)
We introduce the deﬁnition of equilibrium with the market clearing conditions. First, the clearing
conditions in labor markets, recalling that η is the share of entrepreneurs in the economy, and labor supply
(1− lt) is normalized to unity:

Gt = ¯G1−ρgGρg

Next, the market clearing conditions in the ﬁnal goods market. The ﬁrst condition simply states that

He = η

Ct + It + Gt = Yt

Ct = (1− η)ct + ηce

5 Household labor Ht is linked to the deﬁnition of leisure lt by equation Ht = (1− η)lt.
6 The other way to turn this issue tractable is to assume that a small fraction of entrepreneurs consume all their assets and leave

the market in every period. This is observed in Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999)

{Kt+1,Zt+1,Ht,He

4 Data and procedures

In summary, the model has 10 real variables, 16 parameters, 10 equilibrium equations and 4 ex-
ogenous shocks. The time unit of the model is a quarter. In this work, we perform simulations with the

12

aim to approximate actual data, to ensure the robustness of our ﬁndings. We used quarterly data from the
Brazilian central bank (Time Series Management System, SGS) for macroeconomic aggregates, namely
ct,ce
t ,it,gt,kt,ht. Consistent, seasonally adjusted quarterly data for the aggregates span from the third quar-
ter of 1993 to present dates. Data on credit market variables are available at the Relatório de Estabilidade
Financeira7 reports from the Brazilian central bank, available every semester since 2002. In conformity
with other data sources, our period of analysis spans from the ﬁrst quarter of 2003 to the last quarter of
2017. In the spirit of Baker, Bloom and Davis (2013), we considered and discussed several variables as
proxies for economic uncertainty in Section 2, to ﬁnally choose a proxy that is based on stock returns.

To perform the simulations, we input the steady state equilibrium equations into Dynare, a tool-
box for DSGE models available for MATLAB and Octave. Table 1 provides the list of parameters of
the model to be speciﬁed and data sources for calibration. To calibrate the model, we used empirical
data for our period of interest using the data sources noted above, whenever feasible. Otherwise, we re-
sorted to our main references of analytical models with ﬁnancial frictions (CARLSTROM; FUERST, 1997;
DOROFEENKO; LEE; SALYER, 2008; CHRISTIANO; MOTTO; ROSTAGNO, 2014; CESA-BIANCHI;
FERNANDEZ-CORUGEDO, 2014) and the existing literature for DSGE models with ﬁnancial frictions
that study the Brazilian economy (CASTRO et al., 2011; CAVALCANTI; VEREDA, 2011; ARANHA,
2012; KANCZUK, 2013; AREOSA; COELHO, 2015; DIVINO; KORNELIUS, 2015).

We should comment in detail how parameters were retrieved. The discount factor β was calculated as
follows: ﬁrst, we calculated average inﬂation π and interest rates Rn (annualized SELIC) using data from
BACEN, then we applied a relationship found in the canonical real business cycle model:

β =

¯π

(1 + ¯Rn)

(35)

The value found closely matches Carvalho and Castro (2017). For the capital share of production αK,
we follow the literature that sets a value of 0.3 for Brazil (ARANHA, 2012). For the household labor share
of production αH, we set a value of 0.699 to leave a share of 0.001 for the entrepreneurial labor production
(deﬁned in the model as 1− αK − αH).

To set the entrepreneurial discount factor γ, we follow Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997). They set this

– considering that they are more impatient than households. The capital depreciation rate δ follows the
literature (an annual rate of 2%). Next, we draw some parameters that are speciﬁc from this class of models
from the literature (η,ν, µ). Here, we draw special attention to the monitoring costs parameter µ: this
controls the weight of costly state veriﬁcation in the optimal contract setting. The values chosen in the
literature span from 0.15 to 0.30, when studying developed economies. We opt for higher values to reﬂect
imperfections in developing credit markets.

To calibrate the productivity shocks ρA and σA, we ﬁt a ﬁrst-order autoregressive process on GDP
deviations from its long-term trend, a common measure of total factor productivity8. We also employ this
strategy to determine the persistences of ﬁscal policy and uncertainty shocks. Finally, we get the steady
state microeconomic uncertainty ¯S from Cesa-Bianchi and Fernandez-Corugedo (2014), while the steady
state government spending ¯G is obtained by calculating the average government consumption to GDP ratio,
using BACEN data.

5 Results

In this Section we will present the outputs of the model simulations. First, we introduce plots of
impulse-response functions of the model. The impulse-response analysis describe how our model variables
behave upon our exogenous shocks (microeconomic uncertainty shocks, ﬁscal and monetary policies) in
terms of deviations from their steady-state values, up to 40 quarters (10 years) after the shock9. Next,
we further diagnose the correlation between aggregates to ﬁnd if they conform to existing literature and
empirical data. Finally, we perform a welfare analysis of the household in response to the exogenous
shocks to determine possible welfare losses due to microeconomic uncertainty shock.

5.1

Impulse response analysis
For the impulse response analysis, we employ a second-order approximation of policy functions
around the non-stochastic steady state, as in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004). This is necessary as we
expect that the effects of microeconomic uncertainty shocks are limited in a ﬁrst-order approximation as
(i) uncertainty shock are mean-preserving; (ii) only one of the possible states of the model economy is
considered and (iii) evaluation of welfare functions under ﬁrst-order approximations are imprecise. This
also implies that we require a different treatment of impulse response functions, because in a higher-order
approximation we have a multitude of optimal policy functions, according to each of the possible states
generated by microeconomic uncertainty shocks at any given time (histories). We also apply the pruning
procedure implemented by Andreasen, Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramírez (2018) to treat impulse
response functions that exhibit explosive behavior, a problem commonly found in higher-order approxi-
mations. The pruning procedure consists of discarding terms with order greater than the required when
computing the approximated solution of the system.

Figure 4 shows the response of the main model variables to a TFP shock. First, we ﬁnd that impacts to
output and household consumption are but long-lasting. Shocks to investment, labor inputs, entrepreneurs’
net worth and price of capital exhibit a quicker speed of correction to the steady state. Note the rise in
both investment and the price of capital: in the partial equilibrium of capital markets, this indicates a rise in
the demand for capital. Variables PHI, rpBANK and rpENT are, respectively, the steady-state probability of
default for entrepreneurs Φ( ¯ωt,St), the risk premiums for banks and entrepreneurs.

In Figure 5 we plot responses to a positive shock to entrepreneurial net worth shock. We observe
that all variables quickly return to their steady-state values. As expected, interest rates fall, because en-

capital formation and labor force.

9 Plots for government consumption appear only in the impulse responses to ﬁscal policy shocks, because ﬁscal expenditures

are exogenously determined (according to Equation 27).

trepreneurs can ﬁnance a greater deal of their projects internally. The demand for external ﬁnance falls,
causing a fall in the price of capital.

Figure 5 – Responses to a net worth shock

Source: The author.

Figure 6 presents the responses to a positive ﬁscal policy shock. We observe that a ﬁscal policy shock
induces a rise in output, investment and labor aggregates. This is straightforward as the government is
increasing the demand for ﬁnal goods, hence ﬁrms must increase production to clear markets. This increases
the demand for capital, explaining the increase in interest rates. Consequently, household consumption
decreases following a ﬁscal policy shock because a larger fraction of ﬁnal goods are being directed to the
government. An interesting result emerges: ﬁscal stimulus reduces the bankruptcy hazard rate, although the
impact is small.

5.2 The role of microeconomic uncertainty shocks

Figure 7 shows the responses of the model variables to a positive (increasing) shock in microeconomic
uncertainty, our main exogenous shock of interest. The plots reveal that greater uncertainty diminishes

output and especially investment. Also, we learn that ﬁnal goods consumption increases: entrepreneurs
are more impatient than households, so as investment decreases their optimal decision is to prefer present
consumption.

In addition, note that entrepreneurial net worth increases following a microeconomic uncertainty
shock, revealing that in times of greater uncertainty entrepreneurs prefer to ﬁnance their projects internally
in a greater scale. This happens because greater microeconomic uncertainty raises the external ﬁnance
premium, as predicted by the literature of ﬁnancial accelerator models.

We also ﬁnd that aggregate investment decreases, and the price of capital initially responds to uncer-
tainty shocks with a fall, followed by a persistence rise. In the partial equilibrium of capital markets, this is
similar to what happens after a TFP shock, but here there is a decline in capital supply.

Now, we follow the insight from Cesa-Bianchi and Fernandez-Corugedo (2014) and analyze how
steady state values of macroeconomic aggregates change according to the steady state levels of microeco-
nomic uncertainty. Results are plotted in Figure 8, where the steady state levels of aggregates are in the

to 0.25 (a reasonable set of values around the steady-state calibrated value ¯S).

We have found that steady state levels are decreasing in uncertainty, in most economic aggregates.
Consumption, investment and labor supply are decreasing, a fact that is predicted by the literature as a
precautionary savings mechanism. Entrepreneurial net worth is increasing in uncertainty because of the
increasing cost of external ﬁnance. Because investment is decreasing, we conclude that entrepreneurs are
less leveraged when economic uncertainty is higher. The model also predict that steady state interest rates
are lower when steady state levels of microeconomic uncertainty. This result should not be confused with
the impacts of microeconomic uncertainty shocks on interest rates, where in fact interest rates go up and
then oscillate back to the steady state. Otherwise, we combine this with the evidence that investment levels
are decreasing to conclude that in greater steady states of uncertainty, the supply of capital decreases.

5.3 Welfare analysis

Now, we will comment the effects of agency costs in the welfare of agents, by evaluating Equation 34.
In Figure 9 we plot household welfare as a function of agency costs by performing simulations of our model,
using different calibrations for the monitoring cost parameter µ, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 in steps of 0.05, and
for the steady state microeconomic uncertainty ¯S, ranging from 0.15 to 0.25 in steps of 0.05, ceteris paribus.
Simulations show that, as expected, our model economy face welfare losses emerging from our costly state
veriﬁcation problem. While the fall in welfare due to monitoring costs is exponentially smoothed, the fall
due to average uncertainty is approximately linear.

6 Conclusion

The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of microeconomic uncertainty shocks in the Brazilian
economy, with the use of a real business cycle model with ﬁnancial frictions, calibrated for the 2003-
2017 period. Our work explored the underlying investment model in our general equilibrium framework to
investigate the effects of economic uncertainty – emerging from a large number of competitive agents – in
capital accumulation.

We draw a number of conclusions from our research: First, agency costs strongly impact our model
economy. As in other general equilibrium models, they work like capital adjustment costs: asymmetric

information between lenders and borrowers increase the cost of external ﬁnance, with uncertainty shocks
affecting bankruptcy rates and the supply of capital. Second, microeconomic uncertainty shocks impacts
intertemporal choice and capital accumulation. Analyzing the responses from uncertainty shocks impulses,
we found that uncertainty negatively impacts investment, as expected from the literature discussion. A broad
literature points out that this effect would be ampliﬁed in economies with greater credit constraints. Also,
in more uncertain times agents cease to invest and engage in present consumption. Third, microeconomic
uncertainty shocks are welfare reducing, as the steady state levels of household consumption of ﬁnal goods
are decreasing in uncertainty.

The key ﬁndings of this work suggest that authorities should pursue policies that minimize agency
costs in the capital market. As an example, a further development of credit scores by ﬁnancial intermedi-
aries.
