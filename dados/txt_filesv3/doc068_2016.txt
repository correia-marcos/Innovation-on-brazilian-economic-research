Resumo: O objetivo deste artigo é avaliar a importância das características dos prefeitos sobre os 
resultados fiscais. Nossa análise é baseada  em mais de 5000 municípios brasileiros para os quais 
foram coletadas informações sobre receitas, gastos e composição dos gastos, os resultados de três 
eleições  (2000,  2004  e  2008)  e  características  dos  prefeitos  (educação,  experiência  e  gênero).  Os 
efeitos causais são identificados através de regressões com descontinuidade e resultados de eleições 
apertadas.  Não  são  encontradas  evidências  de  que  o  desempenho  fiscal  dos  municípios  é  afetado 
pelo  gênero  dos  prefeitos.  No  que  diz  respeito  ao  nível  de  qualificação  destes,  encontramos 
evidência robusta de que educação e experiência só são importantes para a composição do gasto. 
Prefeitos  com  maior  escolaridade  e  mais  experientes  escolhem  destinar  uma  menor  parcela  do 
orçamento  para  os  gastos  correntes  e  desta  forma  parecem  preocupados  com  a  qualidade  das 
finanças públicas. Esses resultados corroboram a colocação seminal de Avellaneda (2009), de que a 
qualificação dos prefeitos afeta o desempenho municipal em economias descentralizadas nas quais 
os prefeitos desempenham funções políticas e administrativas.

Abstract:  The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  evaluate  the  importance  of  mayor’s  characteristics  on 
fiscal outcomes. Our analysis is based on more  than 5,000 Brazilian municipalities for which we 
have collected information on revenues, spending and spending composition, three election results 
(2000, 2004, 2008) and mayoral characteristics (education, experience, gender). We use regression 
discontinuity and the outcomes of  close  elections to identify causal  effects. We find no  evidence 
that the fiscal performance of a municipality is affected by gender. Regarding the qualification level 
of  the  mayor,  we  find  robust  evidence  that  it  matters  only  for  the  composition  of  spending. 
Experienced  and  educated  mayors  choose  to  devote  a  smaller  fraction  of  the  budget  to  current 
expenditures and as a consequence they seem to be concerned with the quality of public finances. 
Our  findings  represent  additional  support  to  Avellaneda’s  (2009)  seminar  claim  that  managerial 
quality  affects  municipal  performance  in  decentralized  economies  where  the  mayors  perform 
political and administrative functions as well. 
 
 Key  words:  Mayors,  fiscal  performance,  education,  experience,  gender,  regression  discontinuity

1.  Introduction 
      Brazil, 

like  other  countries  around 

the  world,  adopted  administrative  and  fiscal 
decentralization  in  the  hopes  that  increased  information  on  citizen  needs  improved  government 
efficiency, effectiveness, responsiveness and accountability.  

The  shift  of  responsibility  from  central  to  local  governments  came,  however,  with  a 
heterogeneous  response  in  that  some  municipalities  exceed  others  in  terms  of  fiscal  and  policy 
performance. 

 In order to understand the variance in local fiscal municipal response, this paper proposes to 
evaluate  the  determinants  of  municipal  fiscal  performance  given  mayors´  characteristics.  Mainly, 
we  seek  to  explain  the  relevance  of  mayors’  previous  public  sector  experience  and  educational 
achievement on fiscal outcomes. 

Literature points to a series of factors that affect governmental behavior. Among the usual 
economic  variables  (growth  rates,  productivity),  budgetary  institutions  appear  to  be  particularly 
important. Alesina et al. (1999) are the first to formally evaluate the impact of the quality of budget 
institutions, measured by an index that captures different stages of the budgetary process, on fiscal 
performance.  The  evidence  for  20  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  countries  indicates  that 
hierarchical  (top-down)  procedures  that  impose  a  hard  budget  constraint  and  budgetary 
transparency  are  positively  related  to  fiscal  discipline.  Dabla-Norris  et  al.  (2010)  build  multi-
dimensional  indices  of  the  quality  of  budget  institutions  for  low-income  countries,  and  conclude 
that  better  fiscal  institutions  help  improve  fiscal  balances  and  the  adoption  of  countercyclical 
policies. 

Governmental performance can also be explained by the electoral competitiveness hypothesis, 
according to which, more competition is associated with higher performance (Holbrook and Van Dunk 
(1993));  managerial  networking,  managerial  quality  and  personnel  stability,  all  factors  positively 
associated to performance (O’Toole and Meier (2004)); and party’s alternation since higher alternation 
implies  political  instability,  and  as  a  consequence  poor  fiscal  performance  (Calcagno  and  Escaleras 
(2007)).  

As  pointed  by  Avellaneda  (2009)  political  and  economic  factors  are  external  to  public 
organizations, and it is important to take into account the influence of internal organization factors 
as  well,  such  as  manager  characteristics.  The  management  quality  hypothesis  points  out  that 
qualified management contributes to increased performance (Meier and O’Toole (2002); Boyne and 
Walker (2005)). 1 Besides, public policies, although the product of collective action, are shaped by 
the  actions  of  a  single-actor,  the  mayor,  when  the  setting  involves  local  decision  making.  The 
mayor in fact is the most important decision maker for municipal performance, since he performs 
political and administrative functions.  Managers’ education and experience should then contribute 
to performance not only in the private, but in the public sector as well. She suggests as measure of 
managerial quality the mayor’s human capital, that is, his educational background and job-related 
experience.  Both  variables  still  have  the  advantage  of  being  quantifiable  and  observable 
homogeneously across different contexts. 

There are not many studies assessing the influence of manager’s education and experience 
on performance. Gibson and Lehoucq’s (2003) find that more educated mayors (completed years of 
education) hire more staff to monitor forest conditions in Guatemala. Fernández (2005) do not find 
evidence  of  the  impact  of  superintendent  total  years  of  experience  on  the  performance  of  school 
districts in Texas. Congleton and Zhang (2009) and Besley et al. (2011) associate more educated 
political leaders to higher economic growth. Dreher et al. (2009) find evidence that the professional 
background  of  the  head  of  government  influences  the  adoption  of  market-liberalizing  reforms. 
Golhmann and Vaubel (2007) show that, besides mayoral qualifications (education and profession 
background), the gender of monetary policy makers is important for inflation.  Avellaneda (2009) 
                                                 
1 Empirical support to the management quality hypothesis can be found, for example, in Fernández (2005) and Andrews 
et al. (2006).

tests the mayoral qualifications thesis against the political and economic explanations. In order to 
do  so  she  evaluates  40  municipalities  in  the  Colombian  Department  of  Norte  of  Santander,  and 
finds evidence that mayoral qualifications positively influence municipal performance with respect 
to education coverage (school enrollment). However, these positive effect decreases under external 
constraints, such as the presence of illegal armed groups.  

Regarding specifically fiscal outcomes, Persson and Zhuravskaya (2011) show that leaders 
that began their career in a given province and stayed their (inside provincial leaders) have a higher 
probability  of  making  more  infrastructure  investments  than  leaders  that  come  from  a  different 
province  (outside  provincial  leaders).    Jochimen  and  Thomasius  (2012)  find  evidence  that  prior 
professional experience in the financial sector makes finance ministers less prone to deficits. 

In  order  to  verify  the  impact  of  individual  characteristics  of  political  decision  makers  on 
policy outcomes we use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based  on close  elections.  If the 
election between two candidates is sufficiently close, whether the municipality elects an educated 
(experienced) mayor or not is the outcome of a random event. Freier and Thomasius (2012) apply 
the same procedure to evaluate the effects of politician’s qualification (education and experience) 
on local public debt, local expenditures and local taxes, using a sample of German municipalities. 
They,  however,  use  a  fuzzy  regression  discontinuity  design  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  mayor’s 
education since the education level of the winner of an election reflects the average of the university 
graduates for the occupation category of the candidate. Since we have information on the level of 
education of each candidate in each election we can create an indicator variable of whether the new 
mayor is educated or not and use a sharp design. 

There  is  also  a  growing  literature  which  discuss  if  women’s  representation  shapes  actual 
policy  choices.  Alesina  (1998)  and  Besley  and  Coate  (1997)  develop  a  model  to  account  for 
divergence between male and female candidates regarding their policy proposals. Female mayors in 
fact would choose actions that are closer to their preferences, regarding both the size of government 
and  the  allocation  of  resources.  Chattopadhyay  and  Duflo  (2004)  use  the  fact  that  the  heads  of 
village councils in India are responsible for the provision of several public goods in rural areas, and 
that for 1/3 of the councils only women could be elected to the position of head, to account for the 
divergence  hypothesis.  They  find  evidence  that  in  India  in  fact  women  are  more  concerned  and 
invest more in public goods related to their interests, like drinking water.  Svaleryd (2009) assess 
the  effects  of  women’s  representation  in  Swedish  local  councils  on  public  expenditure,  and  also 
concludes  that  women,  relative  to  men,  consider  spending  on  childcare  and  education  more 
important than spending on elderly care. Ferreira and Gyourko (2011), on the other hand, are unable 
to  find  evidence  on  the  effects  of  gender  on  the  size  of  government,  composition  of  spending, 
employment or crime rates for U.S. mayors.  

Given  that  we  have  information  on  mayors’  gender,  we  also  investigate  if  female 

representation affects public finances.  

The  paper  is  organized  in  four  sections  besides  this  introduction.  In  the  second  section  we 
present Brazilian municipalities spending and taxing responsibilities as well as the context in which 
they  operate.  In  the  third  section  we  present  the  data  and  show  some  statistical  evidence.  In  the 
fourth section we describe the empirical strategy, in the fifth we discuss the main results, and in the 
sixth we present evidence on the validity of the research design. Finally, in the seventh section we 
summarize the main conclusions.

2.  Institutional background 2 

During  the  70’s  and  80’s,  despite  the  fact  that  Brazil  was  under  a  military  regime,  the 
political power of municipalities were preserved. As observed by Samuels (2000, 2004) in a large 
number of municipalities direct elections continued to be run and the states’ role as intermediaries 
between  the  national  and  local  governments  were  abolished.  The  result  was  an  increase  in 
municipalities’  political  autonomy  and  in  the  political  capital  of  mayors  since  they  became  the 
politicians directly responsible for the local projects and thus the ones able to claim the credits. 

The controlled electoral opening enlarged the capacity of local governments to expand their 

discretion over expenditures and as consequence their demands for new sources of revenue. 

Gradually  the  military  became  dependent  on  municipalities  for  support  and  legitimacy. 
After the first democratic election for governors and mayors in 1982 the government increased the 
pace of decentralization. 

Congress passed the Passos Porto Amendment in December 1983 increasing the amount of 
constitutionally  mandated  revenue sharing  –  from  federally  collected  taxes,  income  tax  and 
industrial production tax – to states and municipal governments. 

The end of military rule and the transition to democracy in the mid-1980s further boosted 

decentralization. 

“The electoral cycle, of municipal, then governor, then national elections, over a period of 
several years, meant that the nationally elected leaders were riding the coattails of local elections. 
The  military  era  law  of  requiring  parties  to  hold  national,  state,  and  municipal  conventions,  with 
each  delegation  chosen  by  the  one  below  it,  further  shifted  power  and  responsibility  downward 
(Willis, Garman, and Haggard, 1999). The sub-national governments thus have bargaining-power 
and leverage over the national government”. 

The  1988  Constitution  delegated  a  higher  degree  of  fiscal  autonomy  to  sub-national 
governments. It formally established Brazil as a federal republic with three levels of government: a 
federal  government,  twenty-six  states  and  a  federal  district  (Brasília)  and  more  than  5,000 
municipalities.  The  New  Constitution,  therefore,  established  the  legal  status  of  municipalities  as 
federal entities. 

It also established the municipalities’ responsibilities regarding the provision of goods and 
services.  They  include  the  provision  of  basic  education  and  health  services,  the  protection  of 
historical and cultural patrimony and the offer of systems of public transportation. 

Brazilian municipalities have also huge taxation autonomy. They rely mainly on two types 
of taxes: an annual tax on urban land and buildings (Imposto Predial e Territorial Urbano) and a 
tax  paid  by  services  providers  (companies  or  professionals)  to  a  third  party  (Imposto  sobre 
Serviços).  Mayors  are  free  to  choose  tax  rates  on  both  types  of  taxes  and  in  fact  the  rates  vary 
substantially according to the municipality. 

As in other decentralized systems, the policy responsibilities of local governments are not 
fully  financed  by  their  own  tax  revenues.  Therefore,  municipalities  benefit  from  a  complex 
revenue-sharing arrangement and fiscal transfers both from the central and state governments. 

Regarding  the  political  process  of  decentralization,  the  mayor  is  in  charge  of  local 
administrative  matters,  while  the  municipal  legislature  (Câmara  dos  Vereadores)  is  in  charge  of 
local  legislative  matters.  Individuals  (men  and  women)  who  are  more  than  18  years  old  and  less 
than 70 years old are obliged to vote. Individuals who are at least 16 years old and more than 70 are 
free to vote, if they want to. 

                                                 
2  Decentralization  can  be  defined  as  the  transfer  of  authority,  responsibility  and  resources  to  lower  levels  of 
government.  There  are  in  general  two  processes  of  decentralization.  The  political  involves  the  adoption  of    elected, 
autonomous sub-national governments that can make binding policy decisions. The functional decentralization implies 
the transfer of policy responsibilities, expenditure capacity and revenue-raising power to the sub-national governments. 
As such it also involves what some call administrative decentralization and fiscal decentralization.

Since  1996,  both  the  mayor  and  the  municipal  legislature  are  elected  in  general  elections 
every four years.3 The last election happened in 2012. Mayors are chosen through the majoritarian 
system. For municipalities with less than 200,000 inhabitants the election for mayor is decided by 
simple  majority  rule  (more  than  50%,  excluding  blank  and  null  votes).  For  municipalities  above 
200,000  inhabitants  if  neither  candidate  gets  50%  of  the  votes  there  is  a  runoff  between  the  two 
candidates with more votes. 

The increased strength of Brazilian local governments had an important impact in the career 
goals  of  politicians.  High  municipal  autonomy  made  municipalities  an  attractive  choice  for 
politicians as shown by the career path of politicians, which show that municipal-level positions are 
highly demanded by them after they serve in Congress (Samuels 1999, 2000).  

Therefore,  Brazil  is  very  similar  to  Colombia  and  other  Latin  American  countries  where 
mayoral leadership is very important. As well pointed by Avellaneda (2009) “in municipal settings, 
where  the  figure  of  city  manager  is  absent,  the  single  actor,  the  elected  official,  the  identifiable 
individual, as well as the manager, is the mayor. There, the mayor performs not only political but 
also  administrative  functions.  This  makes  the  mayor  the  key  decision  maker  for  municipal 
performance (p. 3)”. 

 

3.  Data and descriptive statistics 

Our analysis is based on a large data set of 5561 (out of 5570) Brazilian municipalities, for 
which information was collected on the outcomes of three mayoral elections (years of 2000, 2004 
and 2008). For the three elections, there is complete information for both incumbent and runner-up 
on educational level, professional background (including rather the candidate had previous public 
sector managerial experience), gender, and vote share.  

The  election  data  come  from  the  Superior  Electoral  Court  (Tribunal  Superior  Eleitoral  - 
TSE), the most important entity of the electoral justice in Brazil. TSE acts jointly with the regional 
electoral  courts  (Tribunal  Regional  Eleitoral  -TRE),  which  are  directly  responsible  for  the 
administration of the electoral process in the states and municipalities. 

It is not an easy task to measure performance, especially in the public sector. In the United 
States, government spending is the usual indicator of managerial efficiency. Although it constitutes 
an objective measure, expenditures by themselves do not tell much about performance since they 
are not linked to quality, as pointed out by Boyne (2002). 

We  could  use  the  growth  literature  to  find  some  argument  in  favor  of  government 

expenditure as a good indicator of performance. 

From  the  theoretical  point  of  view,  public  spending  plays  an  important  role  in  promoting 
economic growth. On the other hand, since higher levels of spending imply that more revenues are 
necessary to balance the budget, the final result is certainly a negative impact on growth given that 
taxes  are  distortionary.  High  levels  of  government  expenditure  can  harm  economic  growth  given 
the economic costs of raising taxation to finance spending. The empirical evidence, however, is not 
conclusive.  Some  studies  do  not  find  a  clear  evidence  of  the  relationship  between  government 
spending  and  growth (for example, Agell  et al.  (1997)), while others  find a negative  relationship 
(Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995)).  There is consensual evidence that taxes do not promote growth 
because they have negative effects on incentives to work, save and invest. 

 The theoretical and empirical literature also cares for the mix of expenditure.  
Empirical works that use an economic classification for the expenditures show inconclusive 
results  for  public  investment.  According  to  the  intuitive  belief,  Avila  and  Strauch  (2003)  find 
                                                 
3Federal and of the state government politicians are chosen in the same election. Therefore, every four years, Brazilians 
vote for a President of the Republic, federal and state parliament members, senators and also a state governor. The last 
election occurred in 2014. Politicians are renewed every  four  years, but every other  year there is one election in the 
country.

evidence that public investment affects positively growth in the EU. On the other hand, Afonso and 
Furceri (2008) find that public investment is not a statistically significant determinant of growth in 
the EU and OECD. The results regarding current expenditures are, however, unanimous. As pointed 
out  by  Barrios  and  Schaechter  (2008)  transfers  and  consumption  impact  negatively  economic 
growth. 

In order to follow the literature, our first measures of performance are total expenditures per 
capita and tax revenues per capita, as measures of the size of government. And in order to take into 
account  another  objective  measure,  we  also  use  as  a  performance  indicator  the  current 
expenditures/total expenditures ratio. It represents a measure of fiscal priority, indicating the quality 
of  spending.  As  discussed  before,  the  composition  of  public  expenditure  is  known  to  be  an 
important determinant of growth, and if governments have as one of their main goals to promote 
growth, priority should be given to the more productive items of the budget.4  

Given that all mayors start their mandates at the same time (January 1), the beginning of the 
mayoral  administration  and  the  beginning  of  the  calendar  year  are  the  same  and  therefore 
municipalities’ fiscal indicators can be associated with a specific mayoral administration. 

Table  1  presents  the  main  descriptive  statistics  for  the  fiscal  outcomes.  It  calls  particular 
attention  the  high  standard  deviation  of  expenditure  per  capita  and  tax  revenue  per  capita,  while 
there is no such heterogeneity for the expenditure composition.

Table 2 shows some  election information. First,  we observe that 9,850 are close  elections 
with a margin of victory of no more than 10% for the winner and, out of those, 5,310 with no more 
than 5%.  Second, we can see that in 21,162 out of 21,286 elections one candidate received a clear 
majority of votes. Only in 124 elections there was a run-off election.

Table 3 presents some mayor characteristics by election. It calls attention how women are 

underrepresented in politics, although they have increased their representation over time. 

Given that the level of education in Brazil is quite low, we decided to use two thresholds to 
separate educated and non-educated mayors. The first one is high school completion. In the 2000 
election, 45.63% of the elected mayors had at least a high school degree. In the 2004 election this 
percentage increased to 48.11%, reaching 50.54% in the 2008 election. When we use a more strict 
definition,  a  university  degree,  the  percentages  do  not  change  much  and  maintain  the  increasing

enrolled in school.

trend, indicating that mayors are surprisingly educated if we compare to the level of education of 
the average population that is quite low. 

Finally,  although  the  percentage  of  experienced  mayors  increased  over  time,  only  30%  of 
the mayors had previous public sector experience in the 2008 election. If we compare education and 
experience it is possible then to conclude that Brazilian mayors’ main characteristic is education, 
not experience.

Table 4 shows the percentage of educated mayors (with at least a high school degree) while 
Table 5 presents the percentage of educated mayors (with a university degree) in each region. It is 
interesting to observe that when  education involves only high school, the percentage of  educated 
mayors increases in all regions and is not very different among regions.

However, when education involves a university degree, the differences among regions is 

 
quite impressive. It calls attention that the Northeast region (one of poorest) and the Southeast (the 
richest) have similar percentages of educated mayors, and that both show a small decrease in the 
percentage of educated mayors over time.

Regarding experience, the Northeast and the Southeast have the most experienced mayors. 
 
This is not surprising, given that the Northeast always had a strong political influence that is passed 
through generations.

As already stated, the present study seeks to evaluate the impact of mayor educational level 
and previous public sector experience, as well as gender, on municipal fiscal outcomes. Two steps 
are  taken  to  assess  this  effect:  (i)  we  estimate  a  fixed  effects  (FE)  model  to  account  for  possible 
omitted  variables;  and  (ii)  we  use  a  regression  discontinuity  design  (RDD)  to  account  for  other 
potential endogeneity problems.  

 It is quite possible that unobservable local characteristics and local economic shocks affect 
the  outcome  of  mayoral  elections  and  other  local  decisions  at  the  same  time,  resulting  in  an 
endogeneity bias of the fixed effects estimator. Therefore, in order to obtain a consistent estimator 
of the mayoral characteristics effect, we use a RDD based on close elections. Given that elections in 
Brazil are compulsory to all citizens between 18 and 70 years of age, possible external factors that 
could affect turnout (such as weather conditions) are not considered to be a significant issue for the 
Brazilian case. 

Our  analysis  of  the  effect  of  mayor  education,  experience  or  gender  on  fiscal  outcome 
variables is close to the one followed by Freier and Thomasius (2012), except that they use a fuzzy 
RDD to evaluate the effects of education on fiscal outcomes while we use a sharp RDD. Our data 
set contains precise information on incumbent and runner up educational achievement, as well as 
previous  professional  experience.  Therefore,  we  are  able  to  clearly  discriminate  mayors  with  a 
university degree or with previous public sector experience from the others.   

The underlying hypothesis to the identification strategy for the RDD is that victory between 
a candidate with a specific characteristic (such as higher education, previous experience or male) 
and one without this characteristic is randomly decided if the election was a very close race.  

The educational level of the election winner is denoted by eduw and of the best opponent by 
eduo.  These  variables  can  take  only  two  values:  0  for  less  than  a  university  degree  and  1  for  a 
university degree. Analogously, previous experience of the election winner in the public sector is 
denoted by expw, and of the best opponent with expo. These variables also can take only two values: 
0 for no previous public sector experience and 1 for public sector experience. Finally, the gender of 
the  election  winner  is  denoted  by  genw,  and  of  the  best  opponent  with  geno,  where  1  is  used  to 
identify males. 

For the regression discontinuity design to be viable, we must consider only the observations 
in  which  the  winner  and  the  best  opponent  have  different  levels  of  education  (eduw  ≠  eduo)  or 
experience (expw ≠ expo), or different gender (genw ≠ geno).  

The vote share of the more highly educated is denoted by vh, and vl for the lower educated. 
Then we define the margin of votes of the higher educated candidate, m, as the difference between 
vh  and  vl.  That  is,  m  =  vh  –  vl,  and  therefore  m  determines  whether  the  candidate  with  higher 

 

8 

education is elected, with the cutoff at m=0. Thus we have a sharp discontinuity in the treatment 
variable (di, described below) at m=0. The same idea applies to experience and gender.  

It is noteworthy that we assess the three mayor  characteristics separately, and, as a result, 
three running variables exist. In other words, mc can be defined in terms of education, experience or 
gender (meduc or mexp or mgen), and the procedure described above for its calculation in the case of 
education is replicated for experience and gender. For simplicity we consider mc as m, where c can 
be education (educ) or experience (exp) or gender (gen). 

The  treatment  di  (where  i  refers  to  the  unit  of  observation,  omitting  a  time  index  t)  is  an 
indicator variable of whether the new mayor is educated or has previous experience or is a male. 
That is, di = eduw in the case of the educational level, di = expw in the case of experience, and di = 
genw in the case of gender. The margin of victory (m) uniquely determines d: d = 1 [m>0]. 

We therefore have a sharp design, given that the relationship is deterministic, and we do not 
have to use instrumental variable estimation to deal with the discontinuity of the treatment variable.

where  the  set  of  control  variables  X  includes  linear  and  squared  terms  of  the  local  population 
number as well as year fixed effects, and the function f(m) is a polynomial in the margin of victory, 
m. 

We  introduce  the  flexible  functional  form  f(m)  in  order  to  control  for  any  correlation  of 
treatment with omitted variables in the error term that could be related with the conditioned margin 
of  votes  (on  education  or  experience  or  gender).  This  requires  a  clear  criterion  for  polynomial 
degree selection. Lee and Lemieux (2010) present an extensive discussion on various approaches to 
defining  the  best  polynomial  specification.  We  use  different  non-parametric  polynomial 
specifications with varying order degrees to verify whether the effects are sensitive to the choice of 
the functional form. The Akaike Criteria is proposed as a generalized cross-validation case to select 
the most adequate polynomial degree.   

The  main  idea  of  the  RDD  is  to  focus  on  the  observations  just  around  the  threshold, 
assuming that the margin of victory, m, cannot be precisely manipulated by the candidates. This is a 
fundamental  underlying  hypothesis  for  the  identification  strategy,  which  leads  to  comparable 
observations  right  and  left  of  the  cutoff.  This  way  the  differences  in  fiscal  outcomes  can  be 
attributed to mayor characteristics. Observations just right and left of the decisive threshold (m=0) 
should have the same characteristics both observable and unobservable, except treatment, that will 
be different just right and left of the cutoff. 

In other words, if an election was a very close race, an election between a highly educated 
(or experienced) candidate against a not as well educated (or experienced) opponent must have been 
decided by random chance. Then, the vote margin between the two candidates, randomly decided 
around  the  threshold,  effectively  determines  treatment.  That  is,  if  the  highly  qualified  candidate 
receives more votes than the opponent, the municipality will have a qualified mayor, otherwise it 
will not. The same idea applies to gender. 

The chosen bandwidth around the threshold (m=0) derives from the optimal robust variance 
estimator  proposed  by  Calonico,  Cattaneo  and  Titiunik  (2015a,  2015b).  As  confidence  intervals 
may significantly change according to the interval chosen, leading to possible inference obstacles, 
the authors propose a robust confidence interval estimator for average treatment effect at cutoff, by 
balancing  the  trade-off  between  squared-bias  and  variance  of  the  RDD  estimator.  This  approach 
presents an additional robustness to estimates, as the optimal bandwidth is only valid when usual 
bandwidth conditions are valid, but add on additional bias-correction.  The adopted kernel functions 
are  triangular,  as  we  seek  to  look  at  average  treatment  effect  and,  therefore,  would  like  to  favor 
middle value observations for treatment, excluding outliers.  

Given the strong case for exogenous treatment attribution our results will be internally valid 
(as  is  further  explored  in  section  6).  However,  external  validity  still  remains  a  challenge.

Observations in which a highly qualified or male candidate wins with a big vote margin might be 
very different from the observations that we consider, so the results should only be generalized with 
care. 

 

5.  Results 

Initially  we  present  evidence  on  the  causal  effects  of  mayor  characteristics  on  fiscal 
outcomes from the fixed effects model (Table 7). The dependent variables are average per capita 
values of each fiscal outcome over the electoral mandate, and the logarithm of these averages. We 
can  note  that  the  mayor  characteristics  show  statistically  significant  effects  on  the  average 
expenditure composition and its logarithm. The more qualified mayors, as well as female mayors, 
tend to spend a relatively smaller percentage of the budget on current expenditures (mostly wages) 
and more on investment.

Graphical presentations of the outcome variables (expenditures per capita, tax revenues per 
capita and expenditure composition) and the value of the rating variable are shown in the appendix. 
They provide evidence of a discontinuity only for the expenditure composition.  

The next three tables (8a-8c) show the results of the RDD analysis related to the three mayor 
characteristics  investigated:  education,  experience  and  gender,  respectively.    For  robustness,  the 
tables  include  the  results  using  three  bandwidth  choices,  both  for  the  average  values  of  fiscal

outcomes  and  its  logarithms.  Besides  the  optimal  bandwidth  -  derived  from  the  optimal  robust 
variance estimator proposed by Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2015a, 2015b) as discussed in the 
previous section - estimators are also presented.       

The  main  conclusion  regarding  the  mayor´s  education  level  and  previous  public  sector 
experience, obtained from the fixed effects model, is maintained in the RDD analysis, that is, more 
qualified  mayors  tend  to  spend  a  relatively  smaller  percentage  of  the  budget  on  current 
expenditures.  Mayors  with  a  higher  level  of  formal  education  tend  to  spend  relatively  more,  but 
clearly  promoting  a  better  kind  of  expenditure.  However,  in  the  RDD  analysis,  the  effects  for 
gender are not statistically significant.

It  seems  that  education  and  previous  experience  may  affect  positively  expenditures  per 

capita, but this result must be seen with caution, as more spending do not imply more quality.  

 

12 

 

   Regarding the composition of spending the results are more robust. Educated mayors seem 
to choose a better mix of expenditures, whatever the specification. Experienced mayors also seem 
to focus on the more productive item of the budget (capital expenditures), although the estimate is 
statistically  significant  only  for  the  optimal  bandwidth.  Therefore,  we  can  conclude  that  mayors’ 
qualification  must  be  taken  into  account  because  the  composition  of  public  spending  is  also  an 
important issue and if the aim is to promote growth, more productive items of the budget must be 
stimulated.5  

 

6.  Internal validity of the regression discontinuity design 
As a last step we test whether our RDD is internally valid, that is, whether treatment attribution 

is indeed exogenous around the cut-off point. 

In order to do so, we first examine graphs plotting the probability of receiving treatment as a 
function of the rating variable.  As can be seen in graphs I.a., I.b. and I.c., there is a “jump” at the 
cut-point in the probability of receiving treatment. Besides, the discontinuity is 1, implying that all 
observations  to  the  right  of  the  cut-off  receive  treatment  (elected  mayors  are  educated  or 
experienced or male) while all the observations to the left of the cut-off do not. Therefore, the RDD 
is sharp.

Then  we  run  an  RDD  for  non-outcome  variables  on  rating  variables.  We  expect  that 
potential covariates (other  explanatory  variables  used in the FE specification) are affected by the 
treatment. Indeed, for all three polynomial specifications, education, experience and gender do not 
impact the non-outcome variables.6

7. Conclusions 
The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  evaluate  the  importance  of  mayor’s  characteristics 
(education, experience, and gender) on fiscal outcomes. The hypothesis is that the main influence 
on  local  performance  comes  from  inside  the  administrative  structure  and  not  from  outside  the 
administrative  structure  (political,  socio-economic  and  institutional  factors)  as  pointed  out  by 
Becerra (2007). Given that the mayors in Brazil perform political functions as well administrative 
functions, it is possible to say that public policies are the responsibility of the mayors, the single 
actors (managers). As there is evidence that gender may also be an important determinant of fiscal 
results we also explore the role of mayors’ gender.  

We  use  regression  discontinuity  and  the  outcomes  of  close  elections  to  identify  causal 

effects. 

We  find  no  evidence  that  the  fiscal  performance  of  a  municipality  is  affected  by  gender. 
Regarding  the  qualification  level  of  the  mayor,  we  find  robust  evidence  that  it  matters  for  the 
composition of spending. Experienced and educated mayors choose to devote a smaller fraction of 
the budget to current expenditures. There is strong evidence that current expenditures do not play a 
role in promoting economic growth and as such they can be considered an unproductive item of the 
budget. Therefore, given that growth is an important concern of governments, a municipality should 
be  led  by  an  educated  and  experienced  mayor  because  he  chooses  a  more  suitable  expenditure 
composition.  
 
These  results  contradict  the  intuition  behind  the  median  voter  theorem,  at  least  in  what 
regards qualification. Voters can control policy decisions since they can have important effects on 
fiscal outcomes through the right choice of the identity of the mayor.

Appendix 
Figures Ia, Ib and Ic illustrate the effect of having an educated, experienced and male mayor on total 
expenditure per capita. Figures IIa, IIb and IIc show the effects of the mayor characteristics on tax revenue 
per capita and figures IIIa, IIIb and IIIc on the expenditure composition. 

Just right of the thresholds are elections in which the educated mayors, the experienced mayors and a 
male  just  won.  The  data  have  been  grouped  in  bins  in  order  to  make  the  results  clearer.  The  outcome 
variables on the horizontal axis are the log of the average of the variable over the mayor mandate.   

 Total expenditure per capita and expenditure composition show a break and/or trend change at the 

cutoff point for both education and experience.
