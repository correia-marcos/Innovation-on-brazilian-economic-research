Resumo 
Este  trabalho  analisa  os  impactos  das  atitudes  nas  preferências  dos  produtores  por 
biotecnologia,  estudando  o  caso  dos  produtores  de  milho  no  Brasil.  Atenção  especial  é 
dada  às  diferenças  entre  milho  geneticamente  modificado  (GM)  –  Bt  e  RH  (resistente  a 
herbicida)  –  e  milho  não  geneticamente  modificado  (não-GM)  –  híbrido  e  variedade.  A 
hipótese central do trabalho é que, além de motivações econômicas, atitudes em relação ao 
ambiente,  à  pesquisa  científica  e  às  instituições  também  afetariam  as  preferências  por 
sementes  GM.  As  análises  baseiam-se  em  dados  primários  obtidos  de  300  questionários 
aplicados  nas  principais  regiões  produtoras  do  país.  Primeiro,  os  produtores  foram 
questionados  a  respeonder  17  questões  em  uma  escala  do  tipo  Likert  com  5  níveis  de 
concordância  (de  “concorda  plenamente”  até  “discorda  plenamente”).  A  análise  fatorial 
identificou  5  atitudes  latentes  entre  essas  variáveis  observáveis  que  discriminavam  os 
produtores  em  relação  ao  conhecimento  de  sementes  GM,  confiança  em  instituições 
agrícolas,  ceticismo  em  relação  ao  meio  ambiente,  percepção  de  risco  e  confiança  na 
pesquisa científica. A confiança nas instituições agrícolas e a percepção de risco tendem a 
ser maiores entre os produtores GM. Ademais, os produtores de sementes Bt tendem a ser 
mais  céticos  em  relação  ao  meio  ambiente.  Posteriormente,  o  trabalho  estimou  os 
determinantes  das  preferências  declaradas  dos  produtores  a  partir  da  ordenação  de  suas 
avaliações  em  relação  ao  tipo  de  semente  que  estariam  mais  propensos  a  adotar.  Os 
produtores  tendem  a  ser  avessos  a  mudanças  no  tipo  de  semente  que  já  cultivam. 
Entretanto,  atitudes  relacionadas  à  confiança  na  pesquisa  científica,  o  conhecimento  de 
sementes  GM  e  o  ceticismo  ambiental  mostraram-se  significativas  em  determinar  a 
propensão a adotar sementes GM.

Abstract  
This  paper  analyzes  how  attitudes  affect  farmers’  preferences  for  biotechnology, 
examining  the  case  of  corn  growers  in  Brazil.  Special  attention  is  paid  to  the  differences 
between  those  who  grow  genetically  modified  (GM)  corn  -  Bt  and  HR  (herbicide 
resistance)  –  and  those  who  grow  non-genetically  modified  (NGM)  corn  –  hybrid  and 
variety.  The  hypothesis  is  that,  besides  economic  motivations,  attitudes  toward  the 
environment and scientific research also affect the preferences for GM seeds. Analyses are 
based  on  a  primary  database  obtained  from  300  corn  growers  in  the  main  producing 
regions in Brazil. First, farmers were asked to answer 17 questions in a 5-point Likert-type 
scale of agreement (from “totally agree” to ‘‘totally disagree”). Factor Analysis identified 
five  latent  attitudes  among  these  observable  variables  that  discriminate  the  farmers  in

using  Bt  seeds  tend  to  be  more  environmentally  skeptic.  Next,  we  estimated  the 
determinants of the farmers’ stated preferences based on their rank-ordered evaluations in 
relation to the types of corn seed they were more willing to adopt. Farmers are usually not 
likely  to  choose a  different  type of seed.  However, trust  in  scientific research, familiarity 
with GM seeds and environmental skepticism showed significant and positive impacts on 
the propensity to adopt GM seeds.

INTRODUCTION 

The commercial liberalization of genetically modified (GM) corn cultivars in Brazil 
began  in  2007,  starting  the  diffusion  process  of  varieties  resistant  to  pest  insects  in  the 
2008/09 crop in regions of large production. The diffusion rate for the 2008/2009 crop was 
estimated at 19%, and the estimate for 2011/12 was close to 70% (Galvao, 2012). The corn 
production plays an important role among large and small farmers in Brazil (Miranda et al., 
2012), and the GM cultivars has shown higher efficiency in comparison with conventional 
ones, reducing risks and increasing productivity (Pavao & Ferreira-Filho, 2011).  

In spite of the significant socioeconomic impacts of the GM adoption, there are still 
few  studies  analyzing  their  determinants  and  the  potential  acceptance  of  these  cultivars 
among  farmers  (Birol  et  al.,  2008;  Skevas  et  al.,  2012).  Studies  usually  highlight  how 
consumers’ perceptions and attitudes towards GM products affect the willingness to pay or 
accept  GM  products  (a  review  of  the  main  studies  is  presented  by  Smale  et  al.  2009).  A 
general conclusion is that, besides socioeconomic motivations, preferences can be affected 
by  general  concerns,  such  as  environmental  attitudes,  perceived  risks,  trust  in  scientific 
research and institutions (Chen et al., 2007).  

This  paper  is  pioneer  in  evaluating  the  determinants  of  stated  and  revealed 
preferences of farmers by GM seeds in Brazil. More specifically, the paper analyzes how 
attitudes toward the environment, trust in agriculture agencies and scientific research may 
affect  growers’  preferences  for  biotechnology,  examining  the  case  of  corn  production  in 
Brazil. Special attention is paid to the characteristics that differentiate the small growers of 
genetically modified (GM) corn - Bt (bacillus thuringiensis) and HR (herbicide resistant) - 
and non-genetically modified corn (non-GM) – hybrid and variety.  

The hypothesis under analysis is that, besides economic motivations, such as capital 
(land  size)  and  costs  (seed  prices  and  royalties),  those  farmers  who  derive  the  lowest 
values from  environmental  diversity, as well as  the highest  values from  trust in  scientific 
research  and  agricultural  institution  are  more  likely  to  accept  GM  seeds.  Making  this 
analysis,  the  paper  contributes  to  the  literature  in  three  ways.  First,  it  is  the  first  applied 
economics  study  to  investigate  the  determinants  of  GM  seeds  among  farmers  in  Brazil. 
Second,  this  study  adds  to  the  growing  literature  that  employs  the  choice  experiment 
method  to  estimate  stated  preferences  for  biotechnology  (Louviere  et  al.,  2000).  Third,  it 
provides important elements to orientate decision making in biotechnology policies for the 
agricultural sector in Brazil. 

Analyses  are  based  on  a  primary  database  obtained  from  300  small  and  medium 
farmers in the main producing regions in Brazil. Since production is highly concentrated in 
this sector, this sample can be considered fairly representative of the universe of these corn 
producers  in  Brazil.  We  used  Factor  Analysis  to  identify  latent  attitudes  and  Conjoint 
Analysis to estimate the determinants of the stated preferences for GM seeds.  
 

1.  ATTITUDES TOWARD GM PRODUCTS 

Attitudes  are  recognized  as  one  of  the  main  factors  guiding  human  behavior 
(Bredahls,  2001).  Since  behavioral  intentions  reflect  individuals’  preferences  and  choices 
in the market, it is reasonable to expect that the use and consumption of GM products will 
be  influenced  by  general  and  specific  attitudes  towards  GM  products.  While  there  are 
many studies addressing the impacts of attitudes on GM acceptance among  consumers in 
developed and developing countries (for instance, Kikulwe et al., 2011; Krishna and Qaim, 
2008; Angulo and Gil, 2007; Chen and Li, 2007; Cook et al., 2002; Quan, 2002), there are 
still  few  researches  on  the  producer  side  (for  instance,  Birol  et  al.,  2008;  Skevas  et  al., 
2012).

GM  cultivars  are  a  relatively  new  phenomenon  in  Brazil  and  many  farmers, 
especially in the less developed regions, had not yet the opportunity to actually analyze the 
costs  and  benefits  of  GM  seeds.  Indeed,  individuals  with  very  limited  experience  about 
technology are more likely to be influenced by their general attitudes before accepting their 
products  (Bredahls,  2001;  Gaskell,  1999).  Moreover,  limited  knowledge  about  GM 
technology may heighten risk perception and reduces acceptance of GM products (Gaskell 
et al., 1999). 

Attitudes towards the use GM products may also express more fundamental beliefs, 
directly  related  to  more  general  attitudes,  such  as  attitudes  towards  environment, 
technology and institutions (Frewer et al., 1997; Chen and Li, 2007).For instance, Siegrist 
(2000) suggests that public attitudes toward emerging technologies, such as GM products, 
are  mainly  driven  by  people’s  trust  in  the  institutions  promoting  these  innovations  and 
regulating its risks. Gaskell et al. (1999) have also found evidences that trust in regulatory 
authorities may help explain the public concern about GM products.  

According  to  Frewer  et  al.  (1997),  the  increased  environmental  concern  is  a 
phenomenon that is likely to increase public resistance to emerging technologies, and thus, 
affect  preferences  for  GM  products.  Opposition  to  the  use  of  GM  technology,  especially 
for  food  production,  has  centered  on  the  not  yet  proven  belief  that  this  technology  poses 
unacceptable  risks  to  the  environment  (Cook  et  al.,  2002).  In  Brazil,  there  are  rural 
organized  movements,  such  as  the  MST  (Movimento  dos  Trabalhadores  Rurais  sem 
Terra),  that  vehemently  opposes  the  use  of  GM  crops  and  their  though  may  affect  small 
farmers preferences.  

Finally, it is also worth considering the effects of perceived benefits and perceived 
risks on GM acceptance. Perceived benefits are believed to be crucial for the acceptance of 
new technologies (Chen and Li, 2007). Since GM seeds may reduce risks concerning the 
rise  of  pest  or  the  use  of  herbicides,  they  would  be  more  likely  to  be  accepted  among 
farmers with higher risk perception.  
 

2.  MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Our  analyses  were  based  on  300  questionnaires  applied  to  corn  producers  in  the 
main Brazilian producing regions (50 questionnaires in the state of Bahia, 45 in the state of 
Goiás,  42  in  Maranhão,  96  in  Minas  Gerais  and  67  in  Santa  Catarina).  The  sample  was 
based  on  producers  with  no  more  than  5  hectares  (57%  of  the  sample).  Large  producers 
were,  however,  also  represented  in  the  sample  with  those  with  more  than  50  hectares  of 
corn planted representing 11%. 

Since there was no accurate information about farmers’ characteristics for each type 
of cotton production in Brazil, we designed a non-probabilistic sample. Sample units were 
selected  according  to  information  provided  by  experts  from  the  EMBRAPA  (Brazilian 
Agricultural  Research  Corporation), 
regional 
cooperatives  of  cotton  producers.  The  types  of  corn  most  frequently  cultivated  in  the 
sample  of  producers  were  hybrid  (115  producers,  or  38%)  and  variety  (105,  or  35%). 
Producers  cultivating  GM  corn  seeds  represented  26%  of  the  sample  (79  producers)  and 
they  were  predominantly  Bt  growers  (71  producers),  since  the  use  of  the  HR  technology 
was still very rare in Brazil (11 producers in the sample).

1.1.FACTOR ANALYSIS  

Factor Analysis (FA) allowed us to identify latent attitudes of farmers in relation to 
the environment, biotechnology, institutions and perceived risks. Seventeen questions were 
presented to the farmers, who evaluated their level of agreement in relation to each of them 
in  a  likert-scale  (see  Table  2).  The  FA  was  then  applied  in  order  to  obtain  m  common 

 

4 

factors  F  that  could  reasonably  explain  the  total  variability  of  the  n  (n=17)  observable 
variables X.  

The  FA  assumes  that  the  observable  variables  X  can  be  expressed  by  linear 
combinations of unobservable and uncorrelated factors F (Kim & Mueller, 1978). In other 
words: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

 
Where a is the factor loading and expresses the relationship between the observable 
variables and the unobservable factors F. Factors F are also called common factors, since 
they  contribute  to  explain  the  variability  of  the  n  observable  variables.  Variables  U  are 
called unique factors, because each unique factor Ui affects only the variability of a single 
observable variable Xi and expresses the behavior not explained by the common factors.  

Other useful variables to understand the results of the FA are the final commonality 
(h2)  and  the  total  variability  explained  by  each  factor  ()  (Cuadras,  1981).  Commonality 
represents the share of the total variability of the  i-th observable variable Xi explained by 
the  m  common  factors  F.  Total  variability  explained  by  each  factor  represents  the 
discriminatory  power  of  the  j-th  factor  over  all  observable  variables.  It  is  also  usually 
expressed  in  relative  terms,  i.e.,  as  a  percentage  of  the  total  variability  of  observed 
variables. 

We  used  the  principal  component  factor  analysis  (PCF)  to  obtain  the  common 
factors  F,  due  to  its  operational  simplicity  and  the  analytical  consistency  of  its  results  in 
our  case.  First,  this  technique  gives  the  factor  F1  that  contributes  the  most  to  explain  the 
variability  of  the  n  observable  variables  X.  Second,  considering  just  the  variability  not 
explained by F1, PCF finds the factor F2 using the same criteria, and so on, until obtaining 
the m factors that explain 100% of the total variability of the n observable variables. 

The factor loadings a are used to interpret the meaning of the factors, considering 
their  linear  relation  and  their  relevance  in  predicting  each  observable  variable  X.  The 
process of rotation is usually used to facilitate the interpretation of the factors. Rotation is a 
linear  transformation  that  sometimes  provides  new  factors  that  are  able  to  make  the 
relationship between the factors and the observed variables more clear and objective, with 
no  impact  on  the  explanatory  power  of  these  factors.  We  used  the  varimax  technique  to 
rotate the factors, which maximizes the sum of the variance of the square coefficients.  

 

1.2.CONJOINT ANALYSIS 

We applied CA to evaluate how farmers estimate their preferences in terms of  the 
corn production system. Data were collected by asking farmers about their preferences for 
different  characteristics  of  cotton  systems.  The  CA  decomposes  the  rank-ordered 
evaluation  judgments  of  corn  systems  into  components  based  on  their  qualitative 
characteristics. For each characteristic of interest, a numerical "part-worth utility" value is 
computed. The sum of the part-worth utilities for each product is an estimate of its utility. 
The  aim  is  to  compute  part-worth  utilities  in  such  a  way  that  the  product  utilities  are  as 
similar as possible to the original rank ordering.  

Different formats of choice studies can be applied, for instance: contingent choice, 
contingent  rating  and  contingent  ranking  (Gonzales  et  al.,  2004).  Contingent  choice  asks 
the interviewee to report a choice from a set of alternatives. This format provides weakly 
ordered  data,  since  only  one  response  does  not  allow  a  complete  preference  ordering 
(Louviere et  al., 2000). In the rating format, the interviewee rates each set of  alternatives 
on a category of the ?? rating scale. Although data in this format are less weakly ordered 
than  in  the  contingent  choice,  it  makes  very  strong  assumptions  about  human  cognitive

iimimiiUdFaFaX...11abilities (Louviere et al., 2000). We preferred contingent ranking, which asks consumers to 
rank a set of alternatives. This format provides a complete preference order, albeit with no 
information about differences in the degree of preferences. 

In  our  contingent  survey,  respondents  were  asked  to  rank  a  set  of  alternatives, 
describing different characteristics of the corn production. Two attributes of interest were 
considered: type of cotton and price (Table 1). The attribute type represents the four most 
commonly  produced  corns  in  Brazil:  GM  Bt,  GM  HR,  hybrid  and  variety.  The  attribute 
price  expresses  variations  in  the  average  price  of  the  seeds  in  Brazil:  lower  than  average 
(between 15 and 20% lower), average value and higher than average (between 15 and 20% 
higher). For GM seeds, we also considered the payment of royalties (R$ 80/hectare). Such 
a design would imply a total of 81 possible alternatives (3 prices for each type = 34), which 
were randomly distributed in sets of four alternatives for each interviewee.

We  modeled  farmers’  preferences  for  each  type  of  seed  using  the  rank  ordered 
probit model (ROP). First, suppose Uij representing the utility of the j-th choice to the i-th 
individual. We can assume that  Uij is  a random  variable with  a systematic component ij 
and an unpredictable random component ij, such that (RODRIGUEZ, 2012): 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) 

Although utility U is not measurable in the contingent ranking experiment, we can 
predict  the  probability  of  choosing  an  alternative  j  in  comparison  with  an  alternative  k. 
Farmer i will choose alternative j in comparison with alternative k if Uij is higher than Uik. 
Thus,  if  Yi  represents  the  choice  of  the  farmer  i,  the  probability  of  choosing  alternative  j 
can be expressed by: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(3) 

 
Making some assumptions about the distribution of the error term ij, we can model 

this probability by (Maddala, 1983):

ijijijU)Pr()Pr(ikijiUUjY 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(4) 

 
In turn, the systematic utility ij can be modeled as a function of the characteristics 

of the individuals (xi) and characteristics of the alternatives (zj): 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(5) 

 
Thus, the coefficients j express how the acceptance of the alternative j is affected 
by  individuals’  characteristics  x  and   express  how  the  acceptance  is  influenced  by  the 
alternatives’ characteristics z.  
 

3.  RESULTS 

The level of agreement of the farmers in relation to several questions is presented in 
Table  2.  Results  highlight,  for  instance,  that  the  great  majority  of  the  farmers  (85%  or 
higher)  see  positively  the  role  of  scientific  research  on  human  life  and  agricultural 
production, as well as they tend to agree that pesticides cause negative impacts on human 
health.  On  the  other  hand,  an  expressive  share  of  farmers  (32%)  does  not  believe  that 
agriculture causes serious damages in the environment.

 Moreover, a large share of farmers does not trust in public policies on agriculture in 
Brazil (39%) as well as they do not trust in private companies that produces seeds (25%). The 
trust in public agencies, such as EMBRAPA and State agricultural agencies is high (72%).  

There  is  a  high  rate  of  knowledge  about  the  types  of  corn  seeds  that  are  resistant  to 
pests  (77%),  herbicides  (75%)  and,  in  particular,  about  those  that  are  more  productive  than 
conventional  seeds  (88%).  The  climate  instability  is  seen  as  the  main  factor  of  risk  in  corn 
production (95%), followed by the rise of pests (87%).  

Next, answers were scored from 1 (Totally Agree) to 5 (Totally Disagree) and used as 
observed  variables  in  the  FA.  We  selected  5  common  factors  based  on  the  discriminatory 
power  of  each  factor  and  on  the  consistence  of  the  latent  attitude  represented  by  each  one. 
Each factor had a marginal contribution higher than 7% and  together they explained 53% of 
the total  variability of the original variables. Based on  the  rotated factor  loadings  (Table  3), 
we interpreted each factor as the following latent attitudes:  

 
Factor 1 – Unfamiliarity with GM seeds and mistrust in agricultural agencies 
This  is  the factor that  most discriminates the variability of the 17 observed variables 
(17%). It has a strong and positive relation with the degree of disagreement that the existence 
of herbicides-resistant corn seeds (Variable 10), agricultural pests (Variable 9) and the trust in 
public and private agencies that carry out agricultural research and produce seeds (Variables 7 
and 8). Thus, the higher the value of this factor, the lower the knowledge about the existence 
of GM seeds and the trust placed in agricultural agencies. 

 
Factor 2 – Environmental skepticism 
This  factor  discriminates  12%  of  the  total  variability  of  the  17  observed  variables.  It 
has  a  strong  and  positive  relation  with  the  degree  of  disagreement  that  the  use  of  pesticides 
has  caused  serious  health  problems  (Variable  5)  as  well  as  the  agriculture  and  the  humans 
have caused serious environmental damages (Variables 5 and 4).  Thus, the higher the value 
of  this  factor,  the  higher  the  skepticism  about  the  impacts  of  human  life  and  agricultural 
production on the environment.  

 
Factor 3 – Lack of risk perception 
This factor discriminates 9% of the total variability of the observed variables. It has a 
strong  and  positive  relation  with  the  degree  of  disagreement  with  the  statement  that  the 
instability  of  the  price  of  inputs,  climate  and  price  paid  to  producers  represent  high  risks  to 
corn  production  (Variables  15,  14  and  13).  It  also  has  a  positive  relation,  to  a  lesser  extent, 
with  the  unfamiliarity  with  seeds  that  are  more  environmentally  friendly  (Variable  12).  We 
can assume that the higher the value of this factor, the higher the lack of risk perception.  

 
Factor 4 – Mistrust in scientific research  
This  factor  discriminates  8%  of  the  total  variability.  It  has  a  strong  and  positive 
relation  with  the  degree  of  disagreement  that  scientific  research  has  improved  agricultural 
production (Variable 1) and human life (Variable 2). Thus, the higher the value of this factor, 
the higher the level of mistrust in scientific research.  

 
Factor 5 – Lack of risk of pests and weeds 
This  factor  discriminates  7%  of  the  total  variability  and  has  a  strong  and  positive 
relation  with  the  disagreement  that  pest  and  weeds  represent  a  high  risk  in  corn  production 
(Variables 16 and 17). Thus, the higher the value of this factor, the lower the perceived risk of 
pests and weeds in corn production.

The  factor  scores  vary  substantially  according  to  the  type  of  corn  cultivated  by  the 
 
farmer  (Table  4).  For  instance,  as  would  be  expected,  the  degree  of  unfamiliarity  with  GM 
seeds and mistrust in  agricultural  agencies (Factor 1) is  higher  among  those farmers that  do 
not cultivate GM seeds. Moreover, Bt farmers tend to show a higher degree of environmental 
skepticism (Factor 2) and have greater trust in scientific research (Factor 4).  

The risk perception  with climate and prices  (Factor  3) is  higher among GM farmers, 
which could justify their choice for seeds that are resistant to weeds and herbicides.  In turn, 
there  is  no  relevant  pattern  of  relationship  between  the  type  of  production  and  the  risk 
perception for pests and weeds (Factor 5).

Next, we estimated the determinants of the farmers’ stated preferences based on their 
rank-ordered  evaluations  for  the  type  of  corn  seed  they  were  more  willing  to  adopt.  The 
interest  variable  in  our  ordered  probit  model  is  the  probability  of  choosing  a  specific 
alternative in comparison with other alternatives. For each farmer, we had four ranked choices 
of corn seeds (Bt; HR; Hybrid and Variety), providing us multiple pairs of comparison.  

 

10 

 

 

Two dummy variables were used to discriminate the characteristics of the alternative 

types of seeds: 
 

i) 

ii) 

Lower:  1  for  price  lower  than  the  average  value  usually  charged  and  0 
otherwise; 
Higher:  1  for  price  higher  than  the  average  value  usually  charged  and  0 
otherwise; 

 

 

And ten variables were initially considered to discriminate the farmers’ characteristics: 
 
i) 
ii) 

Area: total area of cultivated corn in hectares; 
D_Bt:  dummy  variable  that  values  1  if  farmer  cultivates  Bt  corn  and  0 
otherwise; 
D_TH:  dummy  variable  that  values  1  if  farmer  cultivates  HR  corn  and  0 
otherwise; 
D_Hybrid: dummy variable that values 1 if farmer cultivates Hybrid corn and 0 
otherwise; 
D_Variety: dummy variable that values 1 if farmer cultivates Variety corn and 
0 otherwise; 
Factor1-Factor5: scores for the five common factors identified in the FA; 

iii) 

iv) 

v) 

vi) 

Since  there  would  be  high  colinearity  among  these  variables,  especially  between  the 
type of production and the latent factors, we fitted two rank-ordered probit regression models: 
a restricted and an unrestricted model. The unrestricted model (Model 1)  used all controlled 
variables  and  the  restricted  model  (Model  2)  do  not  consider  the  dummies  D_Bt,  D_HR, 
D_Hybrid and D_Variety. Bt corn was chosen to be used as a reference in our analysis. Thus, 
positive coefficients mean higher preferences for alternative j in comparison with Bt.  

Maximum  likelihood  estimates  are  presented  in  Table  5.  The  insignificant  estimates 
for  the  coefficients  related  to  variables  Lower  and  Higher  suggest  that  small  changes  in  the 
price  of  the  seeds  have  no  significant  effect  on  the  stated  preferences  of  the  farmers  for 
different types of seeds. Three factors must be considered to help explaining these results: i) 
the  low  variability  in  relation  to  average  prices;  ii)  the  high  variability  of  prices  charged 
among Brazilian regions; iii) the institutional arrangement of the production. This means that 
all  alternative  prices  presented  to  the  farmers  in  a  specific  region  would  be  lower  or  higher 
than the national average price used as reference. 

Producers  with  larger  cultivated  areas  are  more  likely  to  adopt  Bt  corn.  Moreover, 
dummy  variables  for  the  type  of  corn  cultivated  in  the  farm  (D_Bt,  D_HR,  D_Hybrid  and 
D_Variety) suggest that the revealed choice for GM corn has a positive impact  on the stated 
preferences for this kind of seed. In other words, those farmers cultivating GM seed are less 
likely to choose a non GM seed.  

Some  attitudes  show  significant  impacts  on  the  choice  for  GM  seeds.  For  instance, 
with  other  factors  remaining  constant,  farmers  with  a  lower  risk  perception  of  price  and 
climate (Factor 3) are less likely to adopt non-GM seeds (Hybrid and Variety). However, this 
effect disappears when we do not control the type of seed cultivated in the farm.  

The mistrust in scientific research (Factor 4) is positively related to the choice of non-
GM  seeds.  In  other  words,  farmers  who  trust  in  scientific  research  are  more  likely  to  adopt 
GM  seeds.  Moreover,  the  lack  of  risk  of  pests  and  weeds  (Factor  5)  in  the  farm  seems  to 
affect positively the choice of Variety corn in comparison to Bt corn. 

Finally, the familiarity with GM seeds and environmental skepticism are significant in 
the restricted model (Model 2). In this model, the lower the familiarity with GM seeds (Factor 

 

11 

 

 

1), the higher the propensity to adopt Variety corn in comparison with Bt corn. Moreover, the 
higher the environmental skepticism, the higher the propensity to adopt Bt corn in comparison 
with Variety corn.

CONCLUSIONS 

This  study  provided  important  elements  to  understand  how  the  revealed  and  stated 
preferences of corn farmers in Brazil are affected by general and specific attitudes toward GM 
technology.  First,  results highlighted  that these farmers tend to  optimistically  see  the role of 
scientific  research  on  human  life  and  agriculture  in  Brazil.  Although  they  are  skeptical  in 
relation to the impacts of agriculture on the environment, they are more pessimistic about the 
impacts  of  pesticides  on  the  human  health.  Moreover,  the  climate  and  the  rise  of  pests  are 
seen as the main factors of risk in the corn production. 

As  would  be  expected,  there  is  a  positive  relation  between  the  knowledge  of  GM 
technology  and  the  use  of  GM  seeds.  As  suggested  by  Gaskell  et  al.  (1999),  limited 
knowledge about GM technology tends to increases risk perception and reduces acceptance of 
GM  seeds.  On  the  other  hand,  the  knowledge  of  GM  technology  cannot  be  pointed  as  the 
main responsible for low adoption of GM seeds in Brazil, since most of the farmers, GM and 
non-GM, are aware of the existence of resistant corn seeds  (between 80% and 90%).  

Latent  attitudes  identified  by  the  FA  discriminated  the  farmers  in  relation  to  their 
familiarity with GM seed, trust in agricultural institutions, environmental skepticism, trust in 
scientific research and risk perception of pests and weeds. The trust in agricultural institutions 
is  higher  among  those  farmers  who  cultivate  GM  seeds,  as  well  as  the  trust  in  scientific 
research tends to increase the acceptance for GM seeds. As suggested by Frewer et al. (1997), 
public recognition of the tangible benefits of new technologies is likely to mediate perceptions 
of associated risk and, thus, also affect the acceptance of GM products.  

Bt farmers tend to be more environmentally skeptic and have a greater trust in scientific 
research.  Moreover,  the  higher  the  environmental  skepticism,  the  higher  the  propensity  to 
adopt  Bt  corn  in  comparison  with  Variety  corn.  These  results  deserve  two  main 
considerations.  First,  it  suggests  that,  besides  economic  factors,  farmers  also  consider  the 
impacts  of  their  choices  on  the  environment  and  the  consequences  for  future  generations. 
Second  and  the  most  important,  it  highlights  the  need  to  stimulate  researches  on 
biotechnological safety to oppose the common sense that GM practices may impose risks to 
environment and human health.
