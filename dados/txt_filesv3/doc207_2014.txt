Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of changing family structure on the income distribution in 
Brazil between 1981 and 2011. Specifically, the paper evaluates how changes in the composition of 
the  types  of  families  within  the  richest  and  poorest  family  groups  contributed  (i)  to  increase  per 
capita  income,  (ii)  to  reduce  inequality  and  (iii)  to  reduce  the  poverty.  Additionally,  the  paper 
provides  a  comparison  between  rural  and  urban  areas  in  order  to  understand  how  these  dynamics 
had different impacts on more developed (urban) and less developed (rural) areas. Results highlight 
that  changes  observed  in  the  family  structure  were  more  pronounced  among  the  richest  families, 
contributing to increase the income of the richest families and the income inequality between richest 
and  poorest  families,  as  well  as  between  urban  and  rural  areas.  The  overall  impact  on  poverty 
reduction  was  insignificant.  Finally,  the  paper  investigates  the  per  capita  income  composition  by 
different types of income source (labor, pensions and others) and changes in the period of analysis.

Introduction 

Demographic  changes  have  important  implications  for  income  distribution  and  social 
inequalities (McLanahan & Percheski, 2008). First, the volume and distribution of resources depend 
directly  on  the  size  and  the  distribution  of  families  among  the  poorest  and  richest  households 
(Barros, et al., 2001). Additionally, demographic dynamics tend to affect the labor force supply and 
the  dependency  ratio  differently  across  social  groups,  impacting  indirectly  on  the  income 
distribution and living conditions of the poorest and richest families (Lee, 2005).  

Demographic changes use to be in sync with economic development  (Ashraf, et al., 2011). 
For  instance,  changes  in  the  family  structure  tend  to  be  driven  by  the  wealthier  population,  with 
higher levels of education (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 2005). In 
the  short  term,  this  dynamic  usually  increases  income  inequality  between  the  richest  and  poorest 
families,  since  the  dependency  ratio  of  the  former  group  reduces  faster  (Almas,  et  al.,  2011). 
However,  when  these  changes  are  followed  by  the  poorest  social  segments,  it  may  contribute  to 
reduce  poverty  and  to  attenuate  income  inequality.  In  the  long  run,  despite  the  heterogeneity  of 
effects  between  different  social  groups,  when  the  demographic  transition  attains  the  high  stages 
observed  in  the  developed  nations,  the  benefits  tend  to  be  positive  for  all  the  social  segments 
(Bloom et al., 2010). 

Brazil provides a rich reference to analyze the impacts of demographic changes on income 
distribution. In this country, demographic changes have occurred in a relatively short period, at the 
same  time  that  the  country  witnessed  a  substantial  reduction  in  its  high  levels  of  poverty  and 
inequality.  According  to  Instituto  de  Pesquisa  Econômica  Aplicada  (2012),  the  Brazilian  fertility 
rate dropped from 4.3 children per woman in 1981 to 1.7 in 2011. Moreover, the poverty rate was 
significantly reduced from 33% to 7% in the same period, as well as the differences between the per 
capita  income  of  the  poorest  and  richest  families,  both  within  and  between  rural  and  urban  areas 
(Maia & Buainain, 2011).  

This paper analyzes the impacts of changes in the family structure on the income distribution 
in  Brazil  between  1981  and  2011.  More  specifically,  the  paper  evaluates  how  changes  in  the 
composition  of  the  family  structure  within  the  richest  and  poorest  family  groups  contributed  to 
increase per capita income, and to reduce poverty and inequality. We provide a comparison between 
rural  and  urban  areas  in  order  to  understand  how  these  dynamics  had  different  impacts  on  more 
developed (urban) and less developed (rural) areas. The dynamics of the income distribution is also 
analyzed according to  the source of  income, providing additional elements  to  understand  how  the 
family  types  were  benefited  by  different  socioeconomic  factors  (labor  market,  pensions  and  other 
sources) in the last decades. 

Results  highlight  that,  besides  increasing  per  capita  income,  the  faster  dynamics  of 
demographic  changes  among  the  wealthiest  families  contributed,  per  se,  to  increase  inequality 
between  more  developed  and  less  developed  regions,  as  well  as  between  the  poorest  and  richest 
families within these regions. The overall impact on poverty reduction was insignificant. Analyses 
are based on a comprehensive methodology of decomposition that allow us to estimate the specific 
contribution of changes in the family structure of the richest and poorest families on the variation of 
per  capita  income,  poverty  and  inequality.  The  paper  uses  a  detailed  categorization  of  the  family 
structure that considers both differences in the family relations and fertility rates.

1.1. Family structure and income inequality

Among  the  components  of  demographic  changes  affecting  income  distribution,  family 
structure  plays  a  central  role  as  a  mechanism  for  the  reproduction  of  inequalities  (McLanahan  & 
Percheski,  2008).  Family  experiences  are  associated  with  the  opportunities  that  their  members 
encounter  in  the  economy  and  in  the  labor  market,  which  may  vary  considerably  across  social 
groups and family types. Moreover, since children’s life chances are strongly influenced by family 
experiences,  changes  in  the  family  structure  tend  to  affect  both  inequality  and  intergenerational 
mobility (Parson, 1949).  

Studies  have  highlighted  the  rise  of  single-headed  families,  especially  single-mothers,  and 
its implication on income distribution (Martin, 2006). Besides putting additional individuals at risk 
of poverty, the fast growth of female-headed families among the most vulnerable social groups has 
also  played  an  important  role  in  reproducing  and  increasing  inequalities  in  developed  nations 
(Ellwood & Jencks, 2004). Single-mothers are the only potential earner in the household and tend to 
be  subjected  to  lower  hourly  wages  than  men  and  their  married  women  counterparts  (Cancian  & 
Reed,  2001).  Moreover,  children  living  far  from  a  biological  parent  are  more  likely  to  live  in 
poverty,  which  will  probably  affect  their  future  expectancies  and  ability  to  move  up  the  income 
ladder (McLanahan & Percheski, 2008).  

But  the  growth  of single-mother families is  not  the only important  demographic change in 
the  family  structure.  Cohabitation,  decline  in  marriage,  increases  in  divorce,  non-marital 
childbearing, delays in the marrying age, and late pregnancy resulted in a diversity of new forms of 
family  living  arrangements  (Martin,  2006;  Cancian  &  Reed,  2001).  Changes  in  the  relationships 
between  family  members,  especially  women’s  empowerment,  are  crucial  to  understand  changes 
occurred in recent decades (Lesthaeghe, 1995). Results suggest a loss of centrality of the marriage 
in the family formation (dissociation between marriage and reproduction), as well as the emergence 
and dissemination of new types of families. There is a growing number of single parent families and 
the  so-called  beanpole  families  (characterized  by  a  small  number  of  family  members  in  each 
generation,  they  are  "long"  and  "thin").  These  changes  are  related  to  several  factors,  such  as  the 
fertility reduction, late motherhood, high longevity, increasing number of divorces, and increasing 
number of stepchildren (new families with children from past marriages).  

The impacts  of these and other important demographic  changes, such as  fertility  reduction 
and population aging, have been analyzed between the richest and the poorest countries (Hausmann 
& Székely, 2001), as well as between the richest and poorest families within these countries (Bloom 
et al. 2010). First, the rise of the single-parent and other economically vulnerable family types tend 
to  place  upward  pressure  on  poverty  rates  (Iceland,  2003).  On  the  other  hand,  the  growth  of 
cohabitation, women employment and the overall fertility decline acted conversely, restraining the 
rise in poverty (Cancian & Reed, 2001). Moreover, changes in the distribution of these family types 
among the social groups also affected income inequality. For instance, the income of cohabitating 
families  has  shown  itself  to  be  more  equally  distributed  in  relation  to  the  income  of  nuclear  and 
single-headed families (Martin, 2006). Additionally, the faster reduction in the number of children 
born among the more affluent families can contribute to increase inequality. Income inequality can 
also rise if families become increasingly divided into groups with one earner and groups with two 
earners (Lerman, 1996). 

1.2. Social and demographic trends in Brazil 

In  recent  decades,  Brazil  witnessed  pronounced  demographic  changes  in  addition  to 
substantial  socioeconomic  improvements.  In  the  1980s,  the  number  of  children  per  woman  fell 
dramatically, even among the poorest families  (Cariello, 2013). In the 1990s, the absolute number 
of children stopped growing for the first time, as a result of the falling fertility witnessed one decade 
before. The fertility rate continued dropping in the 2000s: from 2.2 children per woman in 2002 to 
1.7  in  2011  (Instituto  de  Pesquisa  Econômica  Aplicada,  2012).  The  differences  between  income 

 

2 

 

strata also reduced considerably. In 1992, the richest 20% had a fertility rate of 1.4 per woman and 
the  poorest  had  4.7;  in  2011  these  rates  reduced  to  0.9,  and  3.6,  respectively.  In  other  words,  the 
ratio  of  the  number  of  children  per  woman  between  these  groups  reduced  from  3.3  to  2.7.  In  a 
relatively  short  period,  the  Brazilian  richest  women  are  now  experiencing  extremely  low  fertility 
rates, comparable to those observed in developed countries like Italy, Spain, and Japan. The country 
also has a high aging population, caused by both a great decline in fertility and a fast increase in life 
expectancy.  

Simultaneously, Brazil experienced significant changes in their living conditions, especially 
in the years 2000. After a long period of economic instability in the 1980s and early 1990s, poverty 
and income inequality have been reduced considerably since mid-90s (Barros, et al., 2011). Many 
factors  have  been  pointed  as  central  determinants  of  such  socioeconomic  improvements.  The 
country was specially benefited by the increasing prices of commodities and growing exports in the 
2000s, boosting economic growth and socioeconomic improvements. Moreover, institutional factors 
also contributed to attenuate poverty and inequality, such as income cash transfer programs (Bolsa 
Família) and rural pensions (Maia & Buainain, 2011). Non-labor income has risen faster than labor 
income  over  the  past  decades,  especially  in  rural  areas.  As  a  result,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  rural 
areas  in  Brazil  are  historically  characterized  by  poor  living  conditions,  poverty  reduced  faster  in 
these areas, as well as the urban-rural inequality.  

The family structure in Brazil has also changed progressively since the 1980s (Leone, et al., 
2010).  The  most  significant  changes  were  related  to  an  increasing  share  of  single  head  units, 
couples without children, and single mothers with children. On the other hand, the share of nuclear 
and  extended  families  (those  characterized  by  diverse  generations  living  together)  reduced 
substantially. Now the elderly also have a higher empowerment in the households, as a consequence 
of  social  program  targeted  to  this  population,  such  as  the  Benefício  de  Prestação  Continuada 
program  and  the  rural  pension  (Beltrão,  et  al.,  2005).  Moreover,  cash  transfer  programs,  such  as 
Bolsa  Familia,  also  contributed  to  attenuate  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the  more  vulnerable 
family groups, reducing poverty and inequality 

 

2. Materials and Methods 

Analyses  are  based  on  data  of  the  Brazilian  National  Household  Sample  Survey  (PNAD) 
from 1981 to 2011, provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). PNAD 
is  a  cross-sectional  survey  applied  annually  and  is  nationally  representative  of  the  Brazilian 
territory,  with  the  slight  exception  of  a  few  remote  rural  areas  in  six  northern  states,  which 
represented  less  than  3%  of  the  Brazilian  population  in  2000  (Instituto  Brasileiro  de  Geografia  e 
Estatística,  1995)1.  The  long  period  of  analysis,  30  years,  and  the  huge  changes  witnessed  in  the 
period  attenuate  potential  noises  generated  by  annual  fluctuation  in  the  relation  between 
demographic changes and income distribution. 

The categorization of the family structure considers both differences in the family relations 
(single-headed, couples and extended families) and differences in the fertility rate, expressed by the 
number and age of the  children. As a result, ten types of  families were considered:  i) single male 
unit; ii) single female unit; iii) couple without children; iv) couple with children under 14; v) couple 
with (at least one) children 14 or older; vi) single mother with children under 14; vii) single mother 
with (at least one) children 14 or older; viii) single father with children under 14; ix) single father 

                                                           
1 PNAD excludes  the rural areas of the states of  Rondônia,  Acre,  Amazonas,  Roraima, Pará and Amapá. Since 2004, 
these  areas  were  added  to  the  PNAD  sampling  survey.  However,  in  order  to  maintain  historical  comparability,  those 
areas were not considered in this study.

with (at least one) children 14 or older; x) extended family2. People living in collective households 
and those live-in domestic workers with their relatives were excluded in our analysis.  

We compared the impacts of changes in the family structure on the per capita income of the 
10% richest and the 40% poorest families. We also considered differences between urban and rural 
areas in order to analyze in what extend such changes affected differently the income distribution in 
more developed (urban) and less developed (rural) areas. 

Decomposing variation in the per capita income 

In  order  to  evaluate  the  impacts  of  changes  in  the  family  structure  on  the  dynamics  of  the 
income  distribution,  we  first  decomposed  the  variation  in  the  per  capita  family  income  (PCFI)  in 
two sources: (i) changes in the participation of the types of families (composition effect, CE); and 
(ii) changes in the per capita income of each type of family (within effect, WE). Supposes, initially, 
 as the variation in the PCFI between periods       and  . This variation can be represented by 

the weighted sum of the variation witnessed in each type of family: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

Where 

  is  the  proportion  of  the  g-th  type  of  family  and 

  is  its  respective  PCFI. 

Making some adjustments, expression (1) can be rewritten as:  

 

   

 

 

(2) 

Where 

 is the average share of the g-th type of family in periods       and  , 

 is the 

respective  average  PCFI  for  this  type  of  family,  and 
  the  average  PCFI  for  all  families  in  the 
same periods. The first term in expression (2), CE, represents the composition effect, i.e., the share 
of the variation in the PCFI due to changes in the relative participation of the g-th type of family. In 
turn, the second term WE represents the within effect and expresses the share of the variation in the 
PCFI due to changes in the PCFI of the g-th type of family.  

We computed this decomposition for the whole population, for the 10% richest and the 40% 
poorest  families,  as  well  as  for  the  urban  and  rural  families.  This  analysis  allows  inferring,  for 
example, if the monetary gains of each social group were due to changes in the family structures or 
due  to  the  income  dynamics  itself.  The  greater  the  value  of  the  CE,  the  greater  is  the  impact  of 
changes in the family structure on the income variation for the respective social group.  

Decomposing variation in the poverty rate 

First, we defined poverty rate as the ratio between the population living on less than $2.00 a 
day at international prices (R$ 3.6 per day in 2011) and the whole population. We then used similar 
procedures  to  decompose  the  variation  in  the  poverty  rate  (PR)  in  two  sources:  (i)  changes  in  the 
participation of the types of families (composition effect on poverty, CEP); and (ii) changes in the 
poverty  rate  of  each  type  of  family  (within  effect  on  poverty,  WEP).  The  variation  in  the  poverty 
rate between periods       and   can be represented by the weighted sum of the variation witnessed 
in each type of family:

 Where PRg is the poverty rate of the g-th type of family. Making the necessary adjustments, 

we have:

Where 

 is the average poverty rate of the g-th type of family in periods       and  , and 

 is the average poverty rate for all families in the same periods. The first term in expression (4), 
CEP, represents the composition effect on poverty, i.e., the share of the variation in the poverty rate 
due to changes in the relative participation of the g-th type of family. In turn, the second term WEP 
represents the within effect on poverty and expresses the share of the variation in the poverty rate 
due to changes in the poverty of the g-th type of family.  

Decomposing variation in the inequality rate 

Finally, we evaluate the impacts of changes in the composition of the family structure on the 
inequality variation. Analyses are based on the inequality ratio (IR), a ratio between the PCFI of the 
10% richest and the 40% richest families:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(5) 

Where 

 is the PCFI of the 10% richest families and 

 is the PCFI of the 40% poorest 

families. In turn, the variation in the IR between periods       and   can be represented by:

Merging equations (2) and (7) we have:

(8) 

In other words, the variation in the inequality ratio depends both on the composition effects 
(CE10  and  CE40)  and  within  effects  (WE10  and  WE40)  of  the  richest  10%  and  the  poorest  40% 
families. Now, making  counterfactual simulations, we  can estimate the direct  impact of two main 
sources of variation on the IR: (i) changes in the participation of the types of families (composition 
effect on inequality, CEI); and (ii) changes within each type of family (within effect on inequality, 
WEI):

The CEI (expression 9) represents the expected variation in the IR if changes in the PCFI of 
the 10% richest and the 40% poorest families were restricted to the composition effect, i.e., changes 
in the family structure. In turn, the WEI in (expression 10) represents the expected variation in the 
IR if changes in the PCFI were restricted to the within effect, i.e., changes in the PCFI within the 
family  types.  Since  the  variation  in  the  IR  (expression  6)  does  not  allow  a  simple  linear 
decomposition between CEI and WEI, we have also to consider the interaction effect on inequality 
(IEI), this means, changes that depend simultaneously on the variation of the  CE and the WE  and 
cannot be linearly decomposed. Thus, the total variation in the IR will be given by: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(11) 

Finally,  we  investigated  the  composition  of  PCFI.  Three  types  of  income  source  were 
considered:  work  (income  from  all  jobs);  retirement  (government  sponsored  or  private  pension 
plans, and income from permanence allowance) and other sources (income from donations, rentals, 
investments, social programs, and so on). 

 

3. Results 

3.1. Family Structure  

Table  1  shows  the  income  distribution  in  urban  areas  according  to  the  type  of  family  and 
income stratum between 1981 and 2011. Similar results are presented to rural families in Table 2. 
First,  results highlight  the fast  growth of the urban population  (72.8 million  people between 1981 
and  2011)  and  the  sharp  decrease  of  the  rural  population  (9.5  million  people  in  the  same  period). 
Unlike  the  demographic  dynamics  in  developed  countries,  the  transition  from  rural  to  urban 
population occurred in a relatively short period in Brazil. According to Tafner (2006), more than 24 
million people moved from rural to urban areas between the 1980s and the 1990s.  

In 2011, the main differences between family structures in urban and rural areas were, first, 
the higher share of traditional nuclear families in the rural areas (51% of couples with children in 
urban areas and 58% in rural areas). On the other hand, single female units and single mothers with 
children were more frequent in urban areas (14% of single female heads in urban areas and 8% in 
rural areas). Independent of the types of family, differences between PCFI are expressive. The ratio 
between  urban  and  rural  PCFI  varies  between  1.7  (for  single  fathers)  and  2.5  (for  couples  with 
children). Overall, the average PCFI is 2.1 higher in urban areas.  

The main change observed between 1981 and 2011 was the sharp decrease of the share of 
nuclear  families,  especially  couples  with  children  under  14  (a  drop  of  9  percentage  points  in  the 
urban areas and 8 percentage points in the rural areas). Despite this reduction, couples with children 
still accounted for more than half of the Brazilian population in 2011. On the other hand, the share

of  couples  without  children  more  than  doubled  in  urban  areas  (from  5.1%  in  1981  to  10.7%  in 
2011) and almost tripled in rural areas (from 3.8% in 1981 to 11.5% in 2011).

These changes were observed in all strata, but with greater intensity among the richest ones. 
Among  the  10%  richest  families,  for  example,  the  share  of  couples  with  children  under  14 
decreased by 13 percentage points in both urban and rural areas (among the 40% poorest families, it 
decreased by just 4 and 5 percentage points for urban and rural areas, respectively). Meanwhile, the 
share  of  couples  without  children  increased  by  9  percentage  points  in  urban  areas  and  by  19 
percentage points in  rural  areas among the 10% richest  families (it increased by just 2 percentage 
points among the 40% poorest in both urban and rural areas). This latter arrangement tends to have 

 

8 

 

higher levels of income in comparison with other nuclear families, except among the poorest rural 
families, where children usually contribute to the familiar agricultural production. 

Other  important  change  was  the  increasing  share  of  single  heads  with  or  without  children. 
Single mother with children under 14 is the most vulnerable group and grew especially among the 
poorest  families,  in  urban  and  rural  areas  (5  and  4  percentage  points  among  the  40%  poorest 
families  in  urban  and  rural  areas,  respectively).  Among  the  richest  families,  both  single  male  and 
female units increased substantially, and they present the highest PCFI among all types of family.  

Extended  families  represent  another  expressive  group  in  the  family  structure,  especially 
among the poorest urban families (22% in 2011). The dynamic of the family structure also indicate 
an  increasing  representativeness  of  this  group  among  the  most  vulnerable  families  (4  percentage 
points in urban areas and 2 percentage points in rural areas) and decreasing participation among the 
richest group (4 percentage points in urban areas and 3 percentage point in rural areas). Among the 
poorest  families,  this  type  of  family  with  distant  relatives  and  aggregates  may  indicate  a  strategic 
defense, i.e., the need for sharing resources among family members. As a result, it presents one of 
the lowest levels of poverty among urban and rural families (Table 3).  

PCFI  grew  and  poverty  reduced  substantially  between  1981  and  2011  for  most  types  of 
families. This dynamics was more expressive in rural areas, reducing differences between less and 
more developed regions in Brazil. For example, average PCFI increased by 95% in rural areas and 
by  38%  in  urban  areas.  As  a  result,  the  ratio  between  the  urban  and  rural  PCFI  reduced  by  29%, 
from  3  to  2.1.  In  the  same  time,  poverty  reduced  by  50  percentage  points  in  rural  areas  and  24 
percentage points in urban areas.  

In  turn,  inequality  showed  had  opposite  trends  within  less  and  more  developed  areas  in 
 
Brazil. Since PCFI grew faster among the poorest families in the urban areas, the ratio between the 
PCFI of the 10% richest and the 40% poorest families reduced from 18.3 to 14.9. On the other hand, 
since  PCFI  grew  faster  among  the  richest  in  the  rural  areas,  inequality  ratio  increased  from  13  to 
13.6.  As  a  consequence  of  these  divergent  dynamics,  the  high  levels  of  urban  inequality  were 
comparable with those of the rural areas in 2011.

Finally,  it  is  also  worth  highlighting  the  high  levels  of  inequality  among  the  single  head 
units.  Although  single  male  and  single  female  units  are  characterized  by  high  levels  of  PCFI  and 
low levels of poverty, they present the highest levels of inequality in both urban and rural areas.  

3.2. The impacts of changing family structure 

We now analyze the impacts of changes in the distribution of the type of family on the total 
PCFI  variation  (total  effect,  TE)  between  1981  and  2011  (equation  2).  Analyses  allowed  us 
identifying the contribution of changes in the family structure (composition effect, CE) and changes 
in  the  PCFI  of  each  type  of  family  (income  effect,  IE)  on  the  PCFI  variation  (Tables  3  and  4). 
Besides  decomposing  the  income  variation  for  the  total  urban  and  rural  areas,  we  also  performed 
separated analyses for each stratum: the richest 10% and poorest 40%.  

Overall, changes in the family structure had a positive impact on the income variation. The 
impact was higher in urban areas, where R$ 52.9 of the total R$ 228.5 variation in the PCFI (23%) 
were due to the CE, i.e., due to changes in the composition of the types of family. The impact on 
rural areas was lower but still positive: R$ 32.1 of the total R$ 186.7 variation in the PCFI were due 
to the CE.  

These positive impacts were especially due to increasing participation of the less vulnerable 
groups,  such  as  single  male  and  female  units,  and  couples  without  children.  For  instance,  the 
increasing  participation  of  couples  without  children  contributed  with  13%  to  the  total  variation in 
the PCFI in  urban areas  and with  10% in  rural  areas. The increasing participation  of single males 
and females also contributed with 10% to the total variation in the PCFI in the urban areas and with 
4% in the rural areas. Moreover, the reducing participation of couples with children under 14, group 
with  low  PCFI,  also  contributed  positively  to  the  income  variation:  4%  in  urban  areas  and  3%  in 
rural  areas.  On  the  other  hand,  the  tenuous  growing  participation  of  single  mothers  with  children 
under 14, the most vulnerable  group, resulted in the most expressive negative impact  in  the PCFI 
variation: –2% in the urban areas and –1% in the rural areas. 

The CE was larger among the richest 10% families, accounting for 18.5% of the total PCFI 
growth  in  urban  areas  and  7.5%  in  rural  areas.  Similarly  to  the  dynamic  observed  in  the  whole 
population,  this  positive  effect  was  especially  due  to  increasing  participation  of  single  male  and 
female units, and couples without children, as well as to the reducing participation of couples with 
children under 14. On the other hand, changes in the family structure of the poorest families had a 
negative impact on the PCFI variation: –2% in the urban areas and –3.5% in the rural areas. These 
negative  results  were  especially  due  to  the  increasing  participation  of  the  most  vulnerable  family 
type: single mother with children under 14.

The overall impact of changing family structure on poverty alleviation in Brazil was almost 
inexpressive (Table 6). The negative effects of the increasing participation of less vulnerable groups 
on poverty variation, such as  couple without  children  and single head units, were partly  offset  by 
the  increasing  participation  of  single  mothers.  Overall,  changes  in  the  share  of  the  family  types 
contributed with less than 1 percentage point to reduce poverty in urban areas and with less than 3 
percentage points in rural areas. Thus, the expressive poverty reduction witnessed in Brazil between 
1981 and 2011 was especially due to changes observed within these types of families.

Moreover, since the effect of changing family structure on the PCFI was higher among the 
richest families, it contributed to increase inequality in both urban and rural areas. Table 7 presents 
the counterfactual simulation of the impact of changes in the family structure on IR and highlights 
that, if the variation in the PCFI was exclusively due to changes in the composition of the types of 
families (CE), the ratio between the PCFI of the richest 10% and  the 40% poorest families would 
have increased by 1 point between 1981 and 2011. In urban areas this impact was counterbalanced 
by  the  faster  growth  of  the  PCFI  within  poorest  families,  and  IR  decreased  by  3.5  points.  In  the 
rural areas, the overall result was an IR 0.6 point higher in comparison with 1981.

3.3. Sources of Income 

We now analyze the distribution of income according to three sources: labor, pensions and 
others (Figures 1 and 2). Despite a pronounced reduction in the share of the labor income between 
1981  and  2011,  it  still  represents  the  most  important  source  among  urban  and  rural  families.  The 
reduction  was  greater  in  rural  areas,  as  a  result  of  the  intensification  of  target  social  programs  to 
combat  rural  poverty  (Maia  &  Buainain,  2011).  The  share  of  labor  income  reduced  from  85%  to 
78% in  urban areas and  from  91% to  66% in  rural  areas. On the other hand, the share of pension 
incomes  grew from 10% to  19% in  urban areas  and from  6% to  28% in  rural  areas. The share of 
other sources of incomes, which include cash transfer programs (Bolsa Família), grew just in rural 
areas: from 3% to 7%.  

In  2011,  labor  income  was  more  relevant  in  urban  areas,  with  no  expressive  difference 
between the poorest (78% of the total income) and the richest strata (79%). This source of income is 
especially associated with couples with children and father with young children, which may suggest 
a  higher  availability  of  the  family  members  to  offer  work.  In  rural  areas,  the  participation  of  the 
labor income was higher among the richest families, since the poorest rural families depended more 
intensively on income from social programs (others sources).

Amazonas, Roraima, Pará, and Amapá. Information based on table 9 (appendix). 
 

The  participation  of  pensions  in  the  PCFI  grew  especially  among  the  richest  families.  The 
share of this source of income grew from 10% to 19% among the 10% richest in urban areas and 
from  4%  to  24%  in  rural  areas.  The  minimum  value  paid  for  benefit  is  based  on  the  value  of  the 
minimum wage in Brazil. Since this value increased substantially in last decades, pension has been 
pointed as a fundamental determinant of the poverty alleviation in Brazil (Maia, 2010). Pensions are 
specially related to single female, single mother or father with older children and extended families. 
The high dependence among single head units is probably related to retired widows and widowers. 
In  turn,  the  dependence  among  extended  families  may  probably  indicate  a  trend  of  many  family 
members to live with their retired relatives as a strategic defense against poverty.  

While  pensions  grew  faster  among  the  richest  families  and,  thus,  may  have  contributed  to 
increase inequality, the  other sources of income,  which  also  include cash transfer programs,  grew 
faster  among  the  poorest  families.  This  source  of  income  is  especially  important  among  the  rural 
poor families, for whom it represented 24% of the total PCFI in 2011.  It represented near 50% of 

 

15 

 

the  total  PCFI  among  two  of  the  most  vulnerable  family  types  in  the  rural  poverty:  single  female 
and single mother with children under 14.  

 

4. Final considerations 

Brazil has a huge income inequality, one of the largest in the world, and a low level of per 
capita  income.  Between  1981  and  2011,  this  country  witnessed  substantial  changes  in  its  family 
structure, with relevant impacts on income distribution. The average family size declined from 5.0 
in  1981  to  3.4  in  2011,  in  part  because  fertility  decreased  but  also  due  to  changes  in  the  family 
structure. The share of traditional nuclear families reduced sharply, increasing the participation of 
couples without children and single-headed families. The increasing share of extended families with 
several  primary  income  earners  is  also  noticeable,  characterizing  the  process  of  population 
transition of developing countries that have occurred in a short period of time (Chu & Jiang, 1997).  

 
The sharp decrease of nuclear families and the rise of couples without children in both rural 
and urban areas reflect  mostly a sharp decline in the fertility rates.  In rural areas, we have also to 
consider  the  migration  of  many  young  members  from  rural  to  urban  areas,  in  search  of  better  job 
opportunities.  Overall,  changes  in  the  family  structure  contributed  significantly  to  the  income 
dynamics  among  rural  and  urban  families.  First,  the  reduced  number  of  dependent  children  had 
clearly a positive impact on per capita income. However, this positive contribution (i) was greater in 
urban areas, and (ii) was restricted to the higher income strata. Among the poorest families, changes 
in  the  family  structure  had  a  negative  effect  on  the  income  distribution,  contributing  to  reduce 
average per capita income and to increase inequality within urban and rural areas. Similarly to what 
happened  in  developed  nations  (see,  for  instance,  McLanahan  &  Percheski,  2008;  Martin,  2006; 
Lerman, 1996; Karoly & Burtless, 1995), the fast increase of single-headed families in the bottom 
strata,  especially  single-mother  families,  subjecting  an  increasing  share  of  families  to  low  hourly 
wages and to the risk of poverty.  

Poverty  rates  continue  to  be  substantially  high  among  single-mother  families,  which 
contributed to attenuate the positive impact of the increasing number of couples without children on 
poverty reduction in Brazil. The overall impact of changing family structure on poverty was almost 
inexpressive, in both urban and rural areas. High income inequality within each family group also 
helps to explain why the positive impact that changing family structure had on PCFI did not reflect 
more significantly in poverty alleviation. The average PCFI of the 10% richest families is more than 
10  times  higher  than  the  PCFI  of  the  40%  poorest  families  for  all  family  types,  especially  those 
formed  by  single-headed  units.  Inequality  is  lower  within  extended  families,  since  sharing  the 
household  with  additional  earners  provides  economies  of  scale  and  helps  to  attenuate  the 
socioeconomic condition of many traditional families in vulnerable conditions.  

Changes  in  the  family  structure  were  more  pronounced  in  urban  areas,  contributing  to 
increase  inequality  between  more  developed  and  less  developed  areas.  The  lower  impact  of  the 
demographic  changes  on  the  poorest  and  on  the  less  developed  areas  gives  rise  to  two  main 
hypotheses:  i)  the  richest  population  would  be  the  main  beneficiary  of  the  demographic  changes 
(i.e.,  being  favored  by  the  higher  education  levels  and  consequently  by  the  more  pronounced 
reduction in the fertility rate), ii) the intergenerational mobility of the families, where demographic 
changes observed in the transition between the generations within the families would remove these 
poor  families  from  the  lower  tenths  of  the  income  strata.  Unfortunately,  the  second  hypothesis 
cannot  be  investigated  more  accurately,  since  there  is  no  longitudinal  data  available  in  Brazil  to 
analyze  family  mobility.  Nevertheless,  the  demographic  changes  that  have  occurred  among  the 
poorest  families  in  Brazil  are  noticeable  (IPEA,  2012).  A  direct  consequence  of  the  fertility 
reduction among the poorest families would be the reduction of the dependency ratio and growth of 
the PCFI, resulting in many poor families leaving the lower tenths of the income strata.  

16 

 

 

Despite  the  negative  contribution  of  the  demographic  changes  to  the  income  differences 
between urban and rural families, the income inequality between these areas reduced significantly 
in  this  period.  The  income  growth  of  the  poorest  families  arose  from  a  broad  variety  of  sources, 
such as higher wages, labor-force participation, pension and cash transfer programs (Barros, et al., 
2007). All sources of income (labor, pension, and others) grew faster in rural areas, contributing to 
reduce  urban-rural  inequality.  First,  it  is  worth  highlighting  recent  improvements  in  the  Brazilian 
labor  market,  as  a  result  of  higher  rates  of  formalization  and  new  labor  regulations  (increasing 
minimum wage) (Sakamoto & Maia, 2012). The poorest segments were especially benefited, since 
the Brazilian minimum wage grew faster than the average wage (Saboia, 2010). Retirement are the 
second  most  important  source  of  income  and  increased  substantially  for  both  urban  areas  and 
especially rural areas. Moreover, several modifications implemented in the Federal Constitution of 
1988  greatly  benefited  the  rural  population,  such  as  less  restrictive  conditions  for  granting  the 
benefits, and the reduction of the minimum age to start collecting the benefits (Beltrão, et al., 2005). 
Finally,  cash  transfer  programs  implemented  since  the  mid-1990s  clearly  contributed  to  improve 
socioeconomic  conditions  of  the  poorest  family,  particularly  in  rural  areas  (Maia  &  Buainain, 
2011). In the short term, these social policies showed positive impacts on the income distribution. 

Finally,  it  is  worth  noting  that  our  results  do  not  represent  causal  relationships.  In  other 
words,  we  cannot  definitively  say  that  poverty  is  caused  by  changes  in  family  structure  (Iceland, 
2003). Nevertheless, results highlight that a significant share of the population in Brazil has not yet 
benefited  from  the  changes  in  the  family  structure.  When  considered  alone,  these  changes 
demonstrated  regressive  effects  and  have  increased  the  income  inequality  in  Brazil.  However,  the 
poorest families seem to have especially benefited from the economic growth experienced in Brazil 
in  recent  years,  which  contributed  considerably  to  increase  income  and  to  reduce  the  levels  of 
inequality and poverty in Brazil.
