Abstract

This paper aims to evaluate the impact of new actions in labor in-
spections implemented in Brazil that seek to reduce labor informality.
These new actions combines an awareness and a punishment compo-
nent that are targeted to small and medium municipalities. We ex-
plore the fact that the punishment component has diﬀerent intensities
across treated municipalities to identify heterogeneous impacts of the
program. We show that hires that regularizes previous unregistered
employees increase more in municipalities exposed to higher intensi-
ties of the punishment component. But for relatively low levels of this
component, our estimates indicate null eﬀects of the intervention.

Introduction

Labor informality is a widespread phenomenon in developing countries. The
share of informally hired workers can be as high as 60% in Latin American
countries or even higher in South Asian countries.1 On one hand, there is
wide consensus (see, e.g., Perry et al., 2007) that labor informality can be
harmful for workers, the productivity of countries, and government revenues.
On the other hand, there is much less consensus on the relative eﬀectiveness
of alternative policy instruments to reduce labor informality.

One traditional policy instrument is labor inspections. Broad eﬀects of
this instrument have been evaluated by previous studies (e.g., Almeida and
Carneiro, 2012, Almeida et al., 2015, Abras et al., 2018). However, knowledge
on how labor inspections aﬀects labor informality faces three main obstacles.
First, labor inspection practices usually target multiple goals such as for-
mal labor hiring, respect to minimum wage provisions, workplace safety as
well as compliance with many items of the labor code. This multiplicity of
goals makes it diﬃcult to measure the speciﬁc eﬀect of labor inspections on
labor informality alone. Second, standard procedures of labor inspections
combines distinct components including information campaigns, inspections
focused on detecting informality at the extensive and intensive margins, and
distance inspections as well as face-to-face inspections. Third, little is known
about how diﬀerent intensities of these components eﬀectively aﬀect labor
informality. Few studies attempt to disentangle the relative importance of
these distinct features of labor inspections to tackle labor informality.

We contribute to the literature by evaluating a large scale labor inspec-
tion program in Brazil - Plano Nacional de Combate `a Informalidade dos
Trabalhadores Empregados (Plancite) - that was specially targeted to re-
duce labor informality in small and medium municipalities (SMM) in the
country. Apart from having this speciﬁc target, the program combines two
distinct components. One is the provision of information to through let-
ters and e-mails to employers and a local media campaign on the negative
consequences of informality. We refer to this as the awareness component.
The other component is an increase in the frequency of face-to-face inspec-
tions in already tax-registered establishments. This will be referred to as the
punishment component.

The awareness component of the intervention may impact both formal
and informal ﬁrms, as the media campaign was implemented in the local
radios and newspapers. Though the punishment component is focused on

vides harmonized statistics on informal labor.

formal ﬁrms, informal ﬁrms may also be impacted as face-to-face inspections
in SMM are more likely to be noticed by other ﬁrms, including the informal
ones. Thus, these two components of Plancite can act on both the intensive
and the extensive margins of labor informality (Ulyssea, 2018), that is, the
program may aﬀect the share of informal workers in formal ﬁrms as well as
the share of formal ﬁrms. Though we do not attempt to identify the eﬀects of
the program on each margin, it is worth keeping in mind that both margins
may have been aﬀected by the program.

The program, launched in 2014, was targeted only to municipalities with
less than 100 thousand inhabitants and a subset of these municipalities was
chosen to receive the intervention.
Ideally, we would like to identify the
eﬀect of each component separately. However, as both components were
always present in the implementation of the intervention, we followed a two-
way route. First, we exploit the eligibility cutoﬀ of the program and use a
regression discontinuity design (RDD) to identify the program’s eﬀect near
the population cutoﬀ. Given the local nature of this identiﬁcation strategy,
we are only able to identify the eﬀect of the awareness component for the
intensity of the punishment component that prevailed near the cutoﬀ. But
for municipalities with population size away from the cutoﬀ the intensity of
the punishment component varied. We thus leave aside the RDD framework
and instead use a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences (DiD) strategy to identify the eﬀect
of both components for diﬀerent intensities of the punishment component.

In sum, we seek the identiﬁcation of the program’s eﬀects associated to
the awareness component interacted with diﬀerent intensities of the punish-
ment component. We believe this makes an important contribution to the
literature as previous analysis focus on the punishment component alone and
do not explore the potential heterogeneous eﬀects of diﬀerent intensities of
this component.

In fact, our results point that the eﬀectiveness of the program depends
on the intensity of the punishment component. On one hand, we show null
impacts in the three diﬀerent outcomes related to formal employment for
relatively low intensity of the punishment component. On the other hand,
the intervention seems to increase the formalization of unregistered employees
for higher levels of the punishment component.

Apart from this Introduction, the paper contains another four sections.
In the second section, we provide background information about the program
and present the data sources and the variables used in the empirical analysis.
The third section is dedicated to discuss the identiﬁcation strategies and the
estimation procedures we use to estimate the program’s eﬀects. In the fourth
section, we present the results and in the ﬁfth a summary of the ﬁndings and
conclusions.

2 Background

2.1 The Intervention

Labor inspections in Brazil, as elsewhere, have the mandate to check com-
pliance with the labor code. In Brazil, the labor code is extremely detailed,
so labor inspection eﬀorts pulverizes across several dimensions such as the
existence unregistered labor relations, misconducts on paid vacations, pay-
ment for extra hours, lack of contributions for workers mandatory saving
accounts, as well as compliance with many safety conditions. Typically, la-
bor inspections take place either following anonymous requests or through
planned actions by labor authorities. On both cases, the bulk of inspections
is not focused on labor informality but on these other items.

Within this context, Plancite can be considered the ﬁrst supply driven
initiative of the Brazilian labor authorities speciﬁcally targeted to unregis-
tered labor relations, or labor informality. The program, launched in May
2014, originally envisaged multiple components including improvement and
homogenization of the information systems, presentations and speciﬁc train-
ing for inspectors and their supervisors, inspection eﬀorts directed to speciﬁc
industries with higher informality rates, information to employers, and face-
to-face inspections focused on detecting unregistered workers in ﬁrms.

We study the eﬀects of one of the ﬁrst actions within Plancite that took
place between the last quarter of 2014 and the ﬁrst quarter of 2015. It was
restricted to reach municipalities with less than 100 thousand inhabitants
and consisted of two of the previously mentioned components: the provision
of information on the negative consequences of labor informality and face-
to-face inspections.

The ﬁrst of these components included two diﬀerent actions. First, let-
ters (or e-mails) were sent to ﬁrms or to ﬁrms’ accountants informing on
the potential penalties of unregistered labor relations (including the possi-
bility of losing access to public programs) and emphasizing the importance
of registration for the workers (for instance, access to the pension system
or to unemployment insurance). The second action consisted on a media
campaign in local radios and newspapers divulging the same message of the
letters. The second action complements the ﬁrst one in the sense that it
aims circulating the information not only to employers but to other relevant
social actors (including the workers themselves) so as to decrease their com-
placent behavior regarding labor informality. We name this component of
the program the awareness component.

The other component, which will be referred to as the punishment com-
ponent, is an increase in the frequency of face-to-face inspections in establish-

4

ments located in the municipalities that received the awareness component.
Only tax-registered establishments were visited by labor inspectors, whose
focus should be directed to compliance with registration of all labor relations
within the establishments.

In practice, this initiative was implemented in two stages. First, some
municipalities with less then 100 thousand inhabitants (according to the 2010
Census) were selected to receive the ﬁrst component - that is, the sending of
the letters and emails to the local employers and the media campaign. Figure
1 shows the proportion of municipalities receiving the awareness component
according to municipality size, measured by the population in 2010 census.
As it can be seen, the 100 thousand inhabitants threshold was bidding as
probability of the awareness campaign drops from around 30% to zero as
soon as the threshold is crossed from the left.

The low values of the probability of the awareness campaign for the small-
est municipalities worth a comment. It is not driven by a small number of
treated municipalities but rather by the very high number of municipalities
of this size, as can be seen in Figure 2.2 Figure 2 also helps illustrating that

2This heavy tail distribution for population size across municipalities is a stylized fact

across countries, as shown for instance in Gabaix, 2009.

inhabitants threshold.

Following the launching of the awareness campaign, the treatment group
for the punishment component was selected, non-randomly, in a second stage
as a subset of municipalities within those treated by the awareness compo-
nent. This selection targeted municipalities with relative higher informality
rates. As a result, relatively smaller municipalities were more likely to be
visited, as attested by Figure 3, which presents the mean intensity of the
punishment component across municipalities. It is important to point out
that the increase in the rate of inspections for the treated municipalities near
the program’s population cutoﬀ was much lower than for smaller municipal-
ities.

Another important point to notice in Figure 3 is that the average values
of the punishment component to the right of the 100 thousand threshold are
virtually zero. Together with the results shown in Figure 1, this means that
the municipalities to the right of the program cutoﬀ were not treated neither
by the awareness nor by the punishment component. It is also important to
note that untreated municipalities to left of the cutoﬀ did not experience an
increase in the intensity of the punishment component.

2.2 Outcomes and Data

A natural prediction to be tested is that labor inspections should increase
ﬂows into formal employment. That was the objective of the policy makers
when they launched the program. This prediction, however, needs more care-
ful discussion. In principle, the risk of non-compliance becomes higher under
Plancite. This raises the expected costs of labor, which in theory should
decrease labor demand for formal workers. Employers have then to decide
how to adjust to these new conditions. Those that already hired informal
workers may prefer to regularize the labor status of their workforce since
hiring costs have already been incurred, there is higher knowledge about the
quality of workers, and training investments may have been made. But the
rise in expected labor costs should lead at least a portion of employers either
to decrease new formal hires or to increase new formal separations (or both).
Less productive or less “risk averse” employers may instead decide to increase
their labor demand for informal workers or move entirely to informality.

The data we use allow us to measure two types of hires. The ﬁrst is
the total number of formal hires that take place after the oﬃcial period of
30 days that employers have to inform the Labor Ministry. This measure
is more connected to the formalization of informal workers alluded to above

for the eﬃcacy of their actions to reduce labor informality. The other mea-
sure is the total number of hires irrespective of when they were informed to
the Labor Ministry. This measure thus includes both new formal hires and
the formalization of old hires. Both hiring measures are used to construct
some outcomes variables of interest. We also use the total number of formal
separations informed by employers to construct another outcome variable.

We use data from four diﬀerent sources and all share the same municipal-
ity code. First, the department of labor inspection in Brazil (SIT) provided
us with information related to both components of the treatment to be eval-
uated. Speciﬁcally, they provided the list of all municipalities selected for the
program’s awareness component as well as a data set with the total number
of labor inspections that took place between 2012 and 2015 across all mu-
nicipalities in Brazil. These pieces of information are used to construct our
treatment variables.

The second data source is the Cadastro Geral de Emprego e Desemprego
(CAGED), which is an administrative ﬁle maintained by the Brazilian Federal
Government with records for all formal hiring and separations that take place
every month in the country. The information comes from declarations from
all establishments that either hire or ﬁre workers at any moment in time.
Establishments have 30 days to send the information. After this period,
they have to pay a ﬁne and send the information as a regularizing hire. We
use the the former to measure new hires and the latter to measure old hires.
We also measure the total number of separations. These measures are used
to construct our outcome variables.

The third data source is the 2010 demographic Census conducted by the
Brazilian Census Bureau (IBGE). It provides the population size for each
municipality and also the information necessary to compute the share of
informal employment by municipality.

Finally, the fourth source of data is the Rela¸c˜ao Anual de Informa¸c˜oes So-
ciais (RAIS), which is another administrative ﬁle maintained by the Brazilian
Federal Government with annual information on establishments and workers
for the whole country. We aggregate the information at municipality level
and use RAIS for two purposes. First, we use it to compute the number of
establishments at the municipal level that will serve as the denominator of all
rates that are used for measuring the outcome variables and some treatment
variables. The second usage of RAIS is to construct a set of control vari-
ables that are used in some of our estimation procedures. Table 1 lists these
variables and compare the average values for treated and non-treated munic-
ipalities with population size close to 100 thousand threshold. As it can be
seen, there are systematic diﬀerences in observable characteristics across the

8

two groups of municipalities. Such diﬀerences are suggestive of the presence
of non-observable characteristics that may confound the identiﬁcation of the
treatment eﬀects of interest. The next section is dedicated to discuss our
identiﬁcation strategies.

3 Empirical Strategy

3.1

Identiﬁcation and Estimation at the Cutoﬀ

As discussed above, Figures 1 and 3 show that the probability of being treated
jumps as population size crosses the 100 thousand cutoﬀ. This discontinuity
in the probability of being treated can be exploited to (locally) identify the
combined eﬀect of the awareness component at the prevailing level of the
punishment component in the municipalities with population close to 100
thousand inhabitants. This can be accomplished by using the Regression
Discontinuity Design (RDD) strategy. On one hand, as the probability of
treatment does not jump from 1 to 0, we are not in the case of the Sharp
RDD. On the other hand, the probability stays at 0 to the right of the cutoﬀ,
which makes our setting compatible with the partially fuzzy design (Batistin
and Rettore, 2008), also known as one-sided compliance.

9

In such setting, there is no always takers and hence the strategy employed
to identify the eﬀect only for compliers in the (fully) Fuzzy RDD settings is
capable to identify the eﬀect for treated units. In other words, the average
treatment on the treated (ATT) parameter can be identiﬁed through the
same strategy employed to identify local average treatment eﬀect (LATE)
parameter in (fully) Fuzzy RDD settings.

Moreover, Batistin and Rettore (2008) show that such ATT identiﬁcation
in partially fuzzy settings is achieved under the same relative mild conditions
required in Sharp RDD settings. Nonetheless, it is worth emphasizing that
the identiﬁcation is still local in the sense that it holds only for the treated
municipalities near the 100 thousand cutoﬀ.

Taking c to represent the program’s cutoﬀ (100 thousand inhabitants) of
the forcing variable (X), our parameter of interest (τ c) can be identiﬁed as:

E[Y |X = c−] − E[Y |X = c+]

τ c =

(1)
where c− and c+ denotes the corresponding limits of X to the left and to
the right of c, Y is an outcome of interest, and T represents the treatment
dummy.

P r[T = 1|X = c−]

We perform estimation based on the following regression model:

Ym = α + Tmβ + f (Xm − c) + m,

(2)

where m indexes municipalities, f (.) is speciﬁed as a polynomial function,
and  is a mean-zero disturbance term. The parameter of interest is β.

Estimation is based on the robust bias-corrected estimator proposed for
Fuzzy RDD by Calonico et al., 2014, and further enhanced by Calonico et al.,
2019 to allow the inclusion of covariates in the regression model. The imple-
mentation of this estimator requires some decisions concerning the alternative
methods for the selection of the bandwidth size, variance estimation, choices
for the order of the polynomial function f (.), and shape of kernel function.
Our benchmark speciﬁcation uses the bandwidth size computed according
to the minimization method for the mean square error (MSE) proposed by
Calonico et al., 2014, an heteroskedasticity-robust plug-in variance estima-
tor, the linear function for f (.), and the triangular kernel. We also computed
results using alternative choices for the ﬁrst three dimensions. Some of these
supplementary results will be discussed latter while others were left to an
appendix that can be obtained from the authors upon request .

The RDD strategy is widely used for being able to reach a clean identiﬁ-
cation in settings like ours. Nevertheless, we take two further precautions to
avoid the inﬂuence of potential confounding factors. First, we apply a ﬁrst

10

diﬀerence transformation to our dependent variables. This aims to remove
any systematic imbalance of non-observables that are ﬁxed in time.3 The
second precaution consists of using otherwise relevant covariates, which can
also improve the precision of our estimates.

3.2 Identiﬁcation and Estimation of Heterogeneous Ef-

fects of the Punishment Component

In the previous section we discussed the identiﬁcation of the Plancite’s impact
for a given level of the punishment component, namely the level prevailing in
the treated municipalities near the 100 thousand cutoﬀ. In this section, we
discuss the identiﬁcation of the program’s eﬀect as we change the intensity
of the punishment component. For this, we leave aside the RDD framework
and use a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences (DiD) design.

We want to identify the eﬀects of heterogeneous levels of the punishment
component for municipalities that received both the awareness and the pun-
ishment components. To deﬁne diﬀerent levels of the latter component, we
compare groups of treated municipalities with diﬀerent intensities of labor in-
spections. Thus, for the DiD strategy both treatment and control groups are
formed by municipalities that received the awareness component and treat-
ment is deﬁned by higher and lower levels of the punishment component.

To implement the DiD strategy we use quarterly data for our dependent
variables from the ﬁrst quarter of 2012 to the ﬁrst quarter of 2015. As is
standard practice in DiD models, we deﬁne dummies for the post-treatment
period and for the treated units. The post-treatment dummy assumes value 1
only when the observation refers either to the fourth quarter of 2014 (2014.4)
or the ﬁrst quarter of 2015 (2015.1). As mentioned above, the treatment
dummy is deﬁned in diﬀerent ways so as to capture the heterogeneity in
punishment intensity. To be more precise, we deﬁne it as T l
m = 1(0) if mu-
nicipality m was treated and the rate of inspections in that municipality
was above (below) a certain level l. To deﬁne these levels we use the dis-
tribution of the rate of inspections in treated municipalities in 2014.4 and
2015.1. Based on the percentiles of this distribution we deﬁne three levels
for the punishment component heterogeneity: the 60th percentile, the 75th
percentile, and the 90th percentile.

Let m = 1, ..., M index municipalities and t = 2012.1, ..., 2015.1 the time
periods (in quarters) available in the data. Denoting the level of the outcome
variables by ymt, our DiD model can be speciﬁed in the following way:

3A similar approach was employed by Lemieux and Milligan, 2008.

11

ymt = α + T l

mγ + P ostmtδ + (T l

m ∗ P ostmt)β + θmt + δmq + λτ + εmt,

(3)

where T l

m is the treatment dummy speciﬁed above, P ostmt is the afore-
mentioned post-treatment dummy, θmt is a municipality ﬁxed eﬀect inter-
acted with a time trend, δmq is a municipality-by-quarter (q = 1, 2, 3, 4) ﬁxed
eﬀect, λτ is a year ﬁxed eﬀect, and εmt is a disturbance term. Our main
interest relies on the β parameter, which under some identiﬁcation hypothe-
ses will inform the diﬀerential eﬀect of Plancite across municipalities with
diﬀerent levels of inspection rates.

The usual identiﬁcation hypothesis in DiD models is that the evolution of
the outcome variable of the control group is a good proxy for the evolution
of the outcome variable of the treated group in the absence of treatment.
In our case, this parallel evolution refers to what is left after taking into
consideration the diﬀerential trends across municipalities captured by θmt
and the within-year seasonal disparities across municipalities absorbed by
δmq. The speciﬁcation in equation (3) should be rich enough to control for any
diﬀerential pre-program trends between the treatment and control groups. In
the end of the section 4.2 we present the results of a placebo exercise that
is intended to test the capacity of our speciﬁcation to identify the program’s
eﬀect of interest.

In practice, the model speciﬁed in equation (3) can be estimated through:

∆ymt = P ostmtδ + (T l

m ∗ P ostmt)β + θm + λτ + ∆εmt,

(4)

where ∆ represents the ﬁrst diﬀerence between two quarters separated by
one year, that is, between t and t − 4. Note that both P ostmt and λτ are
immune to the ﬁrst diﬀerence transformation.

4 Results

4.1 Results for Local Eﬀect at the Cutoﬀ

Table 2 reports the coeﬃcients estimated for our benchmark speciﬁcation
presented in section 3.1. Results are organized in diﬀerent columns according
to the outcome variable of interest and the three rows inform the set of
control variables introduced in the regression - namely, no covariates, only
the municipal informality rate, and the full set of covariates of Table 1.

Estimates of the Plancite eﬀect on regularizing hiring rates are shown
in the ﬁrst column of Table 2. As discussed in section 2.2, this variable is

12

intended to capture formalization procedures for workers previously hired
under informal contracts. Therefore, we should expect positive values for
the coeﬃcients in the ﬁrst column. Though the point estimates across the
three rows conﬁrm this expectation only the one in the last row is statistically
signiﬁcant, and this is valid only at the 10% level. It seems then that Plancite
was not capable to change the probability of registering informal employees
at least for the combination of the awareness component and the intensity of
the punishment component prevailing in municipalities near the program’s
population cutoﬀ.

Results for overall formal hiring and separation rates are reported respec-
tively in the second and third columns of Table 2. As it can be seen, none
of the estimates are statistically signiﬁcant at conventional levels. As for
the case of regularizing hires, these results indicate that the intervention did
not aﬀect the overall formal labor ﬂows near the population cutoﬀ of the
program.

As mentioned in section 3.1, the implementation of our estimation pro-
cedure requires some choices regarding the functional form of the (local)
regression function, the variance estimation procedure, and the objective
function to be minimized to choose the optimal bandwidth size. In Table 3
we check the robustness of the estimates for the eﬀect on the regularizing
hiring rate to these choices for the speciﬁcation that uses the full set of con-
trol variables. In the ﬁrst column we reproduce the value estimated for our
benchmark speciﬁcation. In the next three columns we present estimates for

13

the same parameter varying only one of the three dimensions listed above.
In the second column, we just change the variance estimation procedure us-
ing a nearest neighborhood variance estimation method (NN). In the third
column, the bandwidth size is based on the minimization of an alternative
objective function that allows for faster coverage error decay rates (CER).
Lastly, in the fourth column, we use a quadratic polynomial in the regression
function.

The main point to be observed in Table 3 is that the marginally signiﬁ-
cant estimate in ﬁrst column is not robust to the alternative speciﬁcations.
Notice that this result comes from estimations conducted for diﬀerent num-
ber of observations and bandwidth sizes, which are shown in the bottom part
of the table. Analogous robustness exercises were conducted for the overall
hiring and separation rates. For both cases, the estimates were not statis-
tically signiﬁcant for all alternative speciﬁcations. The bottom line of these
robustness exercises is that Plancite did not seem to have increased the for-
malization of labor contracts at least for the conﬁguration of the awareness
and punishment components in the municipalities with population around
100 thousands inhabitants.

4.2 Heterogeneity Across Intensity Levels for the Pun-

ishment Component

It is important to bear in mind that the results presented in the previous
subsection are speciﬁc to a certain conﬁguration of the program, in particular
to intensity of the punishment component. In this section, we check whether
results vary as we consider diﬀerent levels of this component.

To be more speciﬁc we estimate the eﬀect for distinct levels of inspection
rates across the municipalities that were treated by both components of the
program. This is implemented using the diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences speciﬁca-
tion presented in section 3.2. Municipalities are grouped as being subjected
to either higher or lower rates of inspection according to whether the munic-
ipal inspection rate was respectively above or below some speciﬁc percentiles
(60th, 75th, and 90th) of the distribution of inspection rates in treated mu-
nicipalities in 2014.4 and 2015.1. The corresponding diﬀerential impact of
Plancite according to each of these thresholds of the punishment component
are reported in each row of Table 4.

One of the main results that comes out from this table is that the rate
of regularizing hires increases relatively more for municipalities that were
exposed to higher rates of inspections. Moreover, the eﬀect size increases
for higher thresholds that separate the municipalities: the eﬀect for the 75th
threshold percentile is 30% higher than for the 30th’s threshold and the dif-
ferential impact between the 90th’s and the 75th’s thresholds is almost 70%.
These results indicate that as the punishment component becomes more in-
tense, the employers in small and medium size treated municipalities react
accordingly formalizing higher shares of their workforce.

Table 4 also shows that such signiﬁcant and robust results for regularizing
hires are not observed for the other two outcome variables reported in the
last two columns of the table. Indeed, apart from one statistically signiﬁcant
(at the 5% level) estimate for the overall hiring rate, all other estimates are
not signiﬁcant on statistical grounds for both variables. Thus, increasing
the intensity of inspection rates does not seem to change the decision of

15

employers regarding overall formal hiring and separations ﬂows in treated
municipalities of small and medium sizes.

It should be pointed out that all our results are for the short term. Results
may change in the longer run depending on whether employers perceive that
the changes brought about by Plancite - specially the punishment component
- are permanent or transitory.

The results shown in Table 4 relies on the identiﬁcation hypothesis that
the evolution of our outcome variables for the group with lower inspection
rates is a good proxy for the counterfactual evolution of the outcome variables
for the group with higher inspection rates. In order to access the plausibility
of this hypothesis, we conducted a placebo exercise where we estimated the
parameters of interest using the same model speciﬁcations but pretending
that the launching of Plancite occurred one year before its actual launching.
One should expect the estimation of null eﬀects as there was no program in
reality. As shown in Table 5, this expected result is conﬁrmed as none of the
estimates are statistically signiﬁcant.

5 Summary and Conclusion

The aim of this study was to evaluate a policy experiment implemented in
Brazil to reduce labor informality through new actions in labor inspection.
These new actions were consolidated in a program called Plancite, and our
evaluation focus on a speciﬁc new action targeted to small and medium size
municipalities in the country. This initiative combined two components. The
ﬁrst consists in providing information on the negative consequences of infor-
mality for employers, workers, and for society in general. The information
was channeled through letters and e-mails sent to employers and also di-
vulged to the population in general by local media. The other component
is an increase in the frequency of face-to-face inspections in the establish-
ments located in a subset of municipalities treated by the ﬁrst component.
We call the ﬁrst component the awareness component and the second the
punishment component.

We explore the fact that the punishment component had diﬀerent intensi-
ties across treated municipalities to identify potential heterogeneous impacts
of the program.
In order to pin down this relative impact, we ﬁrstly ex-
ploited a discontinuity design in the eligibility rule of the program to identify
its impact for a certain level of the punishment component. For a relatively
low level of this component, our results indicate that the intervention had no
eﬀect on the formalization of previously unregistered employees. However,
employing a second identiﬁcation strategy that compares treated munici-
palities exposed to distinct levels of the punishment component, we show
that hires regularizing previously unregistered employees increase in munic-
ipalities submitted to higher intensities of the punishment component. Our
results also indicate that the eﬀect size is monotonically related to the pun-
ishment component intensity, that is, the higher the increase in the rate of
face-to-face inspections, the higher the estimated eﬀect.

We also investigated the program’s eﬀect on overall formal hiring and
separations. For these outcomes, we do not ﬁnd any robust eﬀect of the
intervention irrespective of the intensity in the punishment component. All
our results are robust to many alternative speciﬁcations of the estimation
procedures.

One limitation of our results is that they are restricted to capture the
program’s eﬀects only for the short run. In future work, we intend to extend
the results for longer time horizons.
