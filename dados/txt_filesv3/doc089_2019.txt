Abstract 

We reconsider Kaldor (1966) model of growth and income distribution where he introduces some ideas of 
financial market in the “Cambridge Equation”, extending it to a general model with government activities 
and  an  Open  Economy.  We  show  how  the  implications  of  Political  Orientation  affect  the  income 
distribution. This paper corrects Charles (2007) about the negatively effects the income distribution when 
the government expands the consumption in favour to households. We also prove that the political choice, 
both in the case with and without an Open Economy, does not influence the essential nature of the Kaldor 
neo-Pasinetti dynamic equilibrium and the “Cambridge Equation”. Connections with the neo-Kaleckians 
or post-Kaleckians theories (wage-led and export-led growth) are considered. Next, applying the Olech’s 
Theorem we guarantee that the global equilibrium is stable in both cases.

Resumo 

Reconsiderando  o  modelo  de  crescimento  e  distribuição  de  renda  de  Kaldor  (1966),  onde  ele  introduz 
algumas ideias de mercado financeiro na “Equação de Cambridge”, nós estendemos aqui para um modelo 
geral  com  atividades  governamentais  e  Economia  Aberta.  Mostramos  quais  os  efeitos  a  distribuição  de 
renda  quando  consideradas  as  Políticas  Orientadas.  Este  artigo  corrige  Charles  (2007),  sobre  os  efeitos 
negativos  encontrados  na  distribuição  de  renda  quando  o  governo  expande  o  consumo  em  favor  das 
famílias.  Nós  também  provamos  que  as  escolhas  políticas,  para  ambos  os  casos  com  e  sem  Economia 
Aberta,  não  afetam  a  natureza  da  dinâmica  de  equilíbrio  Kaldor  neo-Pasinetti  e  da  “Equação  de 
Cambridge”. São consideradas conexões com as teorias neo-Kaleckianas e pós-Kaleckianas (wage-led e 
export-led).  Por  fim,  aplicamos  o  Teorema  de  Olech,  garantindo  que  ambos  os  casos  são  globalmente 
estáveis no equilíbrio.

1.  Introduction 

The  theory  of  long-run  growth  macroeconomic  analyses  starts  when  Harrod  (1939)  and  Domar 
(1947)  present  the  “razor  wire”  problem,  which  implicates  that  the  growth  of  the  economy  could  be 
sustainable  if  the  natural  growth  ratio  is  equal  to  the  effective  growth  ratio.  By  analysing  this  problem, 
Solow (1956) and Kaldor (1956) search for an alternative solution. The latter creates a theory of growth 
based on the side of income distribution. This  effort shows us that the growth  rate will be given by the 
multiplication between the propensity to save and the profit rate of the economy. Such result was named as 
“Cambridge  Equation”  and  all  extensions  from  this  theorem  have  to  return  to  the  original  result  if  the 
modifications are not considered. 

Studying the kaldorian approach, Pasinetti (1962) divide the economy in two classes, workers and 
capitalists, saying that Kaldor (1956) committed a “logical sleep” when he did not consider the division of 
classes.  Pasinetti  proves  that  the  “Cambridge  Equation”  is  not  given  by  de  propensity  to  save  of  the 
economy, but only from the propensity to save of the capitalists. This indicates how much the economy 
will grow. 

Using this classes division, but named the capitalists as firms, Kaldor (1966) create the “Kaldor neo-
Pasinetti  Theorem”.  His  model  present  two  sides.  It  shows  how  the  existence  of  the  financial  system 
implicates on the income distribution. The first side indicates the traditional profit rate and the second the 
valuation ratio of the firms in the financial market. The significant point of this theorem is that the profit 
rate affects negatively the valuation ratio, and the existence of financial assets leads to a reduction of the 
profit rate.  

Concerned with to how the valuation ratio and the profit rate behave in Kaldor neo-Pasinetti model, 
Araújo  (1995) reproduce graphically the theory and design the model  as  an  IS-LM alternative. Another 
extension is presented by Panico (1997), which introduce the concept of capital gains to analyse how the 
existence  of  firms  can  impact  the  level  of  income  and  the  implication  on  the  income  distribution  with 
government activities. It is interesting to note that all the Political Orientations of the above extensions were 
assumed to be exogenous. Trying to endogenize these assumptions, Charles (2007) introduces the concept 
of  investment  increased  by  government  expenditures  involving  two  favouring  choices.  The  first  is  to 
increase the consumption (households) and the second to expand the profit of the economy (firms). 

The  relevance  of  the  Kaldor-Pasinetti  theory  persists  in  our  days,  Romero  (2019)  combine  the 
kaldorian perspective with Schumpeter to present a new cumulative growth model. Another example is the 
empirical analyses to the case of the “Cambridge Equation”. Pacheco-Lópes and Thirlwall (2014) verify 
the association between manufacturing output growth, export growth as well as between export growth and 
GDP  growth  in  89  developing  countries.  Bernardo,  Stockhammer  and  Martínez  (2016)  shows  the 
reinterpretation of the Tobin’s q from the Kaldor neo-Pasinetti perspective. George (2018) made a positive 
analysis of the modern capitalism from the Pasinetti perspective to consider the implication of investors 
decisions in a long-run perspective.  

The  present  article,  focussing  the  kaldorian  perspective,  analyses  the  interaction  between 
government, financial market and an Open Economy (especially introducing the Political Orientation to the 
model).  In  this  case,  we  are  dealing  with  a  more  realistic  context  in  comparison  with  the  most  of  the 
literature. This work is divided in five sections; the first one synthesizes the history and contextualizes the 
literature.  The  second  presents  the  evolution  of  the  “Kaldor  neo-Pasinetti  model”  and  their  extensions, 
showing the development of the theory. Also corrects the formal version of the model published by Charles 
(2007), since it contained a number of mistakes.  

In the third section we extend the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti model” showing the effective expansion of 
the consumption by the government and the stability condition of this extension. This improved alternative 
has as consequence interesting results about the proper incentives (increasing consumption) of the Political 
Orientations to households. This leads to a positive relation with income distribution. In the fourth section 
we extend our model to the case of an Open Economy showing the impact of this new configuration, using 

 

2 

the same approach as in the third section when we use the Olech’s Theorem for the stability condition, as 
was presented by Garcia (1972). Section 5 contains the conclude remarks. 

 

2.  Review of the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti model” and extensions 

Kaldor (1966) starts with the assumptions that in this model we have two classes, firms and workers. 
The first agent is owned by capitalists and workers (households) and the profit is divided between then. 4  
The  last  agent  will  also  be  remunerated  with  wages  coming  from  his\her  jobs.  The  sum  of  these  two 
remunerations is equal to the national income. The savings functions are similar to the one used by Pasinetti 
(1962)  when  he  made  the  distinction  between  workers  and  of  capitalists.  Following  Kaldor  (1966)  and 
Charles (2007) assumptions:5 

 

 

Y = W + P                                                                 (i) 
S = Sw + Sf                                                              (ii) 
Sw = swW                                                                 (iii) 
Sf = sfP                                                                    (iv) 
xI = swW − cG                                                         (v) 

The difference from the equations above and Kaldor (1956) is that he and Charles (2007) consider 
that the total saving is composed by the one of workers and that of firms. The new part of the investment 
function derived  from  the financial market  is  given by  (v).An interesting  property of this equation is  to 
show that the existence of financial market will be direct affected from workers savings. 
Following the assumptions by Kaldor (1966), Araújo (1992), Charles (2007) and Lavoie (2014), the 
equilibrium between investments and saving to maintain the full employment has to be written as in (vi) 
and (vii):6  

 

 

I = sfP + xI                                                                              (vi) 
I = sfP + swW − cG, been 0 ≤ c ≤ 1                                    (vii) 

The capital gains in (v) and (vii) is provided from financial market equilibrium where the valuation 

ratio (vr) is equal to the amount value of equities (pN) divided by the total capital stock (K). That is: 

 

vr =

pN

K

                                                             (viii) 

 
Deriving (viii) with respect to time, and applying some algebraic manipulations, we have the capital 

gains function. This results can be either positive (capital gain), zero or negative (capital loses). Thus: 

 

G = (vr − x)I                                                          (ix) 

 
Substituting (ix) in (vii), Kaldor (1966), Araujo (1995), Charles (2007) obtained the main results 
like as presented in Lavoie (2014). First of all, they find the profit rate “Cambridge Equation” (1), showing 
that the existence of financial market  will make  a decreasing impact  on the profit rate. The other  result 
presents  the  valuation  ratio  (2),  which  indicates  the  signal  of  capital  gains.  The  rate  of  investment  by 
financial market is impacted positive in the valuation ratio: 

 

                                                           
4 It is possible to consider that not all the workers own part of the firms, but those who have earn profits. This concept is 
maintained in the rest of this paper.  
5The notations is standard  (see  Appendix 1). 
6 All the investments functions in  this article are based on the Keynes perspective,  where this variable is  exogenous and the 
distribution is given by the saving function, as we can see in Bertola (2000).

Following assumptions (i) to (ix), Panico (1997) introduced the government expenditures (x) which 
increase the investment function (vii). He assumed that the government budget is balanced as expressed by 
(x) and (xi): 

 
 

 

Ge = T                                                                                                 (x) 
T = twW + tpP, been 0 ≤ tw ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ tp ≤ 1                        (xi) 

Assuming the existence of government and the respective direct taxation, we obtain the right landside 
of the  equations (xii) and (xiii) which, in  equilibrium, show that investment  is  equal  to  total  amount  of 
saving, as expressed by (xii): 
 

I + Ge = sf(1 − tp)P + sw(1 − tw)W − cG                             (xii) 
xI = sw(1 − tw)W − cG                                                      (xiii) 
I + Ge = sf(1 − tp)P + xI                                                         (xiv) 

 
After  some  mathematical  manipulations,  Panico  (1997)  shows  new  extensions  of  Kaldor  (1966) 
approach now with government activities, as presented in (3) and (4). The interesting part of these results 
is  concerned  with  the  existence  of  the  government  expenditures  affecting  positively  the  profit  rate  and 
negatively the valuation ratio as we can see in the equations below (we just have to make the partial derivate 
of r and vr with the respect to ge):

                                                                                      (3)

Note that ge =

 . However, the government  expenditures decisions  are exogenous. Wondering 

about this, Charles (2007) elaborated a kaldorian extension model with Political Orientation which deserver 
especial  attention.  The  section  V  of  his  article  starts  by  differencing  the  government  orientation  in  two 
ways. The first was to increase the consumption in favour to households and the second to increase profit 
favouring to firms. Being 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, we have: 

 

Ge = α(C̅ − C), C̅ > C, been 0 ≤ α ≤ 1                               (xv) 
Ge = α(P̅ − P), P̅ > 𝑃                                                          (xvi) 

 
The equation of the consumption (xvii) incorporates the taxation: 
 

C = cw(1 − tw)W + (1 − sf)(1 − tp)P + cG                     (xvii) 

 

Mathematical  manipulations  in  the  Appendix  2  indicate  that  Charles  (2007)  committed  some 
mathematical mistakes. Our first contribution corrects his results in relation to the consumption incentives. 
His model disappeared with the difference between the valuation ratio and the share of investments financed

Equations  (5)  and  (6)  show  us  that  the  government  expenditure  to  incentive  the  households  will 
affect the income distribution negatively.  In  addition, the equation (7) and (8) indicate that  government 
expenditures tend to increase profit and the profit ratio will be bigger, favouring the firms.  

A  number  of  extensions  considers  some  cases  and  empirical  applications  for  the  Kaldor  neo-
Pasinetti approach, published by Park (2002), Ryoo (2016) and Ryoo (2018).  Thinking about the incentives 
and fiscal policy we realized that some issues were not considered in the extensions above. One of our main 
contribution  is  to  present  how  much  bigger  it  will  be  C̅ > 𝐶  .  From  this  assumption  we  develop  a  new 
extension of the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti Theorem” with proper Political Orientation. We formulate this new 
approach in section 3 of this paper.  

 

3.  Extension of the Kaldor neo-Pasinetti Model With Proper Political Orientations 

This part of our article focus on a generalization for the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti Theorem”, concerning 
governmental economic Political Orientation favouring consumption (benefit to households) and/or profit 
(benefit  to  firms),  from  government  preferences  determinate  by  the  political  power.  Our  contribution  is 
composed  in  two  characteristics:  the  first  is  that  we  are  considering  that  the  government  can  incentive 
simultaneously both classes in the model and what happens in our new extension when the policymakers 
decide to increase consumption. This is defined here as the sum of the consumption of the economy and 
the incentive derived from the government expending (income transfer). 

Assume the assumptions below: 

 

Ge = βα(C̅ − C) + (1 − β)α(P̅ − P)                                     (xviii) 
0 ≤ β ≤ 1                                                                             (xix) 
P̅ > 𝑃                                                                                   (xx) 
C̅ > 𝐶                                                                                  (xxi) 
C̅ = C + Gi                                                                          (xxii) 

 

 
For each economy, we have the coefficient β determined, and the decision of how much it will be 
spend  as  incentive  to  consumption  and/or  profit,  defined  by  the  maximization  function  Ge =

 

5 

max⁡{αG𝑖⁡, α(P̅ − P)}.  From  these  values  the  government  will  distribute  the  incentives  using  (xviii)7. 
Expression  (xxii)  introduce  the  increased  amount  of  consumption  by  the  current  policy  favouring 
households (Gi).  Following Kaldor (1966), Panico (1997) and Charles (2007) we have: 
 

S = Sw + Sf = sf(1 − tp)P + sw(1 − tw)W − cG                     (xxiii) 
T = twW + tpP                                                                            (xxiv) 

 

Substituting (xxii) in (xviii): 

 

Ge = βα(Gi) + (1 − β)α(P̅ − P)                                      (9) 

 

Which  represents  the  government  expenditures  considering  Political  Orientations  to  both 
consumption and profit, where the first is designated to households and the second to firms. From some 
mathematical  manipulations,  as  we  can  see  in  the  Appendix  3  (a),  we  develop  our  extension  of  the 
“Cambridge Equation” to the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti Theorem”. 

 

 

 

r =

gn(1−x)+(1−β)αr̅+βαgi

[(1−β)α+sf(1−tp)]

                                                  (10) 

 
It is easy to see that the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti Theorem” can be obtained by assuming that α = 0. 
Furthermore, the extension of the “Cambridge Equation”, by Steedman (1972), is obtained if α = x = 0. 
We get Pasinetti (1962) if  α = x = tp = 0.  

Relaxing the assumption of full capacity utilization, we take into account the implications of non-
competitive  markets  and  their  imperfections8.  To  determine  an  investment  function,  as  in  models  à  la  
Kalecki, it is possible to construct a new version of our extension with wage-led and profit led growth view. 
Another  accomplishment  to  consider,  instead  of  to  propose  the  incentives  to  consume,  we  determinate 
income transfers to  workers and the analysis of how will behave the fluctuation  of the income in short, 
medium9 as well as to determinate the equilibrium in long-run term from Kalecki’s and Kaldor’s visions. 
A  desirable  extension,  linking  the  idea  of  Political  Orientation  and  Kaleckians  views,  could  be 
supported by the following sentence in Lavoie and Stockhammer (2012, p. 1): “Income distribution can be 
modified or influenced by appropriate government policies that act both on primary income distribution, 
for instance by reinforcing the bargaining power of labour unions or securing low real interest rates and on 
secondary income distribution, by modifying the tax code”. This is something to think in another work. 

To deal with the interrelation between neo-kaleckian (post-Kalekian10) and kaldorian models, in the 
case of small closed economy for both theories, Araujo and Teixeira (2015) as well as Araujo and Teixeira 
(2016)  reinterpreted  the  “Cambridge  Equation”,  which  can  be  viewed  as  particular  case  of  the  Kalecki

 , α = 1 , Gi = 4 and P̅ − P = 2 . From these values we have Ge =
7 For an example, consider the following parameters: β =
max⁡{4⁡, 2}    and  using  (xviii),  Ge = 0,5 ∗ 4 + 0,5 ∗ 2 = 2 + 1 = 3,  which  determinate  the  amount  of  2  for  incentives  to 
consumption and 1 for incentives to profit. 
8 The study more precisely the relation between capacity utilization and non-competitive markets, imperfections in the labour 
market (unemployment), we indicate Hein (2014, p. 241-271), which treat about the Kaleckians basic models. 
9 As was treated by Ros (2016), when he distinguish both short and medium term to determinate the impact of a wage-led 
growth theory in an small developing economy with two sectors. 
10 The difference between neo and post-Kaleckian are that the first one has as a precursors Dutt (1984) and Rowthorn (1981) 
works, which is known as wage-led theories and the second one start from Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) and Kurz (1990) works, 
as we can see in Hein (2017).

determinate the valuation ratio of the model, which is expressed by (9):

gn(1−x)+(1−β)αr̅+βαgi

[(1−β)α+sf(1−tp)]

] − x(1 − c)gn}            (11) 

In the same way that r was analysed from (10), we can obtain from (11) the original model if α =
tp = tw = 0. Our expressions (10) and (11) has as a especial case, considering β = 0, the Charles extension 
with Political Orientation to firms11. These equations show a new general extension of the “Kaldor neo-
> 0 
Pasinetti Model”. To see how the r and vr behave we can apply the partial derivations:

(households)  and/or  profit  (firms),  it  follows  that  the  income  distribution  will  be  affected  positively. 
Consequently the profit ratio will increase. Note that we have been dealing with a model for small closed 
economy. In order to generalize our approach, we extended it to the case of an Open Economy in section 
4. 

 

3.1. Stability Analyse of the Model Without an Open Economy. 

In this subsection we apply the Olech’s Theorem to analyse the stability of our extension. From the 

equation (2A)12 we obtain:

Considering  that  the  net  demand  for  placements  (xxv)  is  equal  to  the  workers  savings  less  the 
consumption from  capital  gains  and the supply of new securities issues by  the corporation  (xxvi), as in 
Davidson (1968) and Araújo (1995), we have: 

Dp = sw(1 − tw)W − cG                                          (xxv) 
Sp = xI (

Following  the  conventional  IS-LM  stability  analyses,  we  postulate  the  equilibrium  adjustment

11  Based  on  an  erroneous  assumption  to  increase  consumption,  determinate  by  Charles  it  is  not  possible  to  obtain  from  our 
equations (10) and (11) his results. 
12 “A” refer to an equation in the Appendix 3 (a).

From (12) and (13) we can analyse the stability condition, considering the first term of the Taylor 
expansion.  From  this,  we  are  allowed  to  determinate  the  matrix  system:  and  in  the  middle  we  have  the 
Jacobian Matrix:  

 

 

J[E(r, vr)] = [

−δ[(1 − β)α + sf(1 − tp) − sw(1 − tw)]

−φsw(1 − tw)

δcgn
−φcgn

]                    (14) 

Applying the Olech’s Theorem in (14), we have all the tools to analyse the stability in a Matrix 2x2. 

This is a necessary and sufficient condition, if the trace is negative and the determinant is positive, thus:  

 

 

Tr(J) = −δ[(1 − β)α + sf(1 − tp) − sw(1 − tw)] − φcgn < 0                   (15) 
|J| = δφcgn[(1 − β)α + sf(1 − tp)] > 0                                                  (16) 

These results show us that with all the assumptions assumed above, the model is stable as required. 

Furthermore, we conclude that our extension satisfied the stability conditions, as indicated in Figure1. 

Figure 1: Dynamic Equilibrium without an Open Economy.

Equalizing the equation (10) and (11), we can determinate the value of the equilibrium β∗ to our 

extension: 

 

 

       β∗ =

sw
v

(1−tw)[α+sf(1−tp)]−x(1−c)gn[α+sf(1−tp)]−[gn(1−x)+αr̅][cgn+sw(1−tw)]

(αgi−αr̅)[cgn+sw(1−tw)]+

sw
v

(1−tw)α−x(1−c)gnα

          (17) 

With some numerical exercise, it is possible to conclude that a changes in the parameters  α ,  sf  or  
tp , in the equilibrium, only affects the value of β∗. However, if we modify the value of sw , v , tw , g , x or 
c , both  values of β∗ and the equilibrium between r and vr will be altered.

4.  An  extension  of  the  “Kaldor  neo-Pasinetti  model”  with  Political  Orientation  and  an  Open 
Economy 

This section will concentrate on the implications of an Open Economy in a “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti 
Model” with economic policy. We consider what happens if our extension takes into account the financial 
international  market  and  how  this  can  improve  the  income  distribution.  Such  formalized  preoccupation 
came from Kaldor (1966). We are considering an income function presented by Metcalfe and Steedman 
(1979) and also used by Teixeira & Araújo (1997) when the latter  introduced the idea of foreign bounds. 
Thus: 

 

 

Y = W + P + F                                                   (xxvii) 

Being, F = iZ, i = r, the new assets are holding by firms and will be introduced in the general saving 
of an Open Economy impacting the aggregate investments. Let (xxviii) be the saving function and (xxix) 
the aggregate investment. Thus: 

 

S = Sw + Sf = sw(1 − tw)W + sf(1 − tp)(P + F) − cG              (xxviii) 
AI = I + Ge + M − X + rZ                                             (xxix) 

 

From these new conditions we develop our extension considering an Open Economy, as we can see 

below: 

 

 

∴ ⁡r =

gn(1−x)+(1−β)αr̅+βαgi+gnz

(1−β)α+sf(1−tp)(1+z)−sw(1−tw)z

                                           (18) 

The crucial point to notice is that (18) is an extension of the “Cambridge Equation” with Political 
Orientation and an Open Economy. This extension can be linked to the neo-Kaleckian theory, when the 
export-led  growth  model  is  considered.  Such  literature  was  started  by  Blecker  (1989)  and  Bhaduri  and 
Marglin  (1990).  The  former,  was  concerned  with  the  relationship  between  income  distribution  and 
international competitiveness, being extended by the later, which introduced the real exchange rate to the 
model. 

Hein (2014, Chapter 7) shows that the exchange rate is the cause of redistribution in this kind of 
models  and  he  also  presents  the  positive  relationship  between  profit  share  and  international 
competitiveness. This assumption can be relevant if linked to our model and considers the effects13. In order 
to  introduce  the  financial  sector,  it  is  possible  to  follow  the  investment  function  presented  by  Arestis, 
González-Martinez and Dejuán (2016), when they consider the relation between capital accumulation and 
financial market. 

Therefore, as was done by Araujo and Lima (2007), it is possible to analyse the implications of the 
balanced-payments-constrained  growth  in  different  economic  structures  and/or  structural  changes. 
Following  their  proposal  one  may  consider  to  construct  a  new  Kaleckian  extension  to  verify  some 

                                                           
13 Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) and Hein (2014, p. 290) show that we have to consider a domestic and foreign capacity utilization 
to deal with the demand of import and export in the export-led growth models.

implications of our assumptions on Political Orientation and Open Economy with Financial Globalization14. 
We leave this to another opportunity.15 

The Kaldor neo-Pasinetti model also presents the valuation ratio.  
 

vr =

cgn

{

sw
v

(1 − tw) − sw(1 − tw) [

gn(1−x)+(1−β)αr̅+βαgi+gnz

(1−β)α+sf(1−tp)(1+z)−sw(1−tw)z

] − x(1 − c)gn}      (19) 

 
The equations (18) and (19) show that in the case of an Open Economy and Political Orientation we 
will have a positive result for the profit ration. On the other hand, like in Kaldor (1966), the implication of 
the profit ratio will be negative to the valuation ratio. The partial derivative of profit ratio in relation to the 

foreign  equities  is  negative  (

∂r

∂z

< 0).  However  to  the  valuation  ratio  it  will  be  positive (

∂vr
∂z

> 0).  One 

important issue here is that both total income to capitalists and workers are direct influence from the Current 
Balance of Payments (difference between exports and imports) and that is a sensitive issue, because in the 
case of a sustainable deficit in the long-run perspective, both classes will be damaged as we can interpreted 
in Teixeira and Araújo (1997). 

One important issue here is that both total income to capitalists and workers are direct influence 
from  the  Current  Balance  of  Payments  (difference  between  exports  and  imports)  and  that  is  a  sensitive 
issue, because in the case of a sustainable deficit in the long-run perspective, both classes will be harmed 
as we can see in Teixeira and Araújo (1997). 

 

4.1. Stability analyse of the model with an Open Economy. 

Using the procedure to the stability from extension without Open Economy, we now have to apply 

it to this case. From (1B)16 we have: 

 

dt

dr

= E(r, vr) = δ [gn −

sw
v
sw(1 − tw)(1 + z)]r + βαgi + (1 − β)r̅ + cgvr − cxgn}⁡, δ > 0  (20) 
 
Take  into  account  the  assumptions  (xxv)  and  (xxvi),  but  considering  the  national  income  from 

(1 − tw) − [(1 − β)α + sf(1 − tp)(1 + z) −

] = δ {gn + gnz −

sw
v

(xxvii), we have:

sw
v

(1 − tw) − r[sw(1 − tw) − sw(1 − tw)z] − cgnvr + cxgn − xgn} , 
⁡⁡φ > 0 (21) 

dvr
dt

 

To analyse the stability condition, we have to consider the first term of the Taylor expansion and 

from this we obtain the matrix system and the matrix in the middle is Jacobian Matrix (J). Thus: 

 

J[E(r, vr)] = [

−δ[(1 − β)α + sf(1 − tp)(1 + z) − sw(1 − tw)(1 + z)]

−φ[sw(1 − tw) − sw(1 − tw)z]

δcgn
−φcgn

]      (22) 

 

                                                           
14 It is essential to know that, one important difference between the Kaldorians perspectives and the neo-Kaleckians approaches 
on the capacity utilization is that in the first case is assumed full employment and in the second one is not. These imply in a great 
difference in studies about structural change and economic structures. We recommend to read Palley (2013). 
15 If the reader has the  intention to deepen in others kinds of  methodologies  issues on an  Open Economy,  we advise to read 
Romero and McCombie (2017), especially for the case considering Thirlwall’s Law. 
16 “B” refers to equation (2B) in the Appendix 3 (b). 

 

10 

Applying the Olech’s Theorem in (22), we have all the tools to analyse the stability in a Matrix 2x2. 
As already stated above, this is a necessary and sufficient condition if it trace is negative and the determinant 
is positive, thus:  

 

 

Tr(J) = −δ[(1 − β)α + sf(1 − tp)(1 + z) − sw(1 − tw)(1 + z)] − φcgn < 0      (23) 

|J| = δφcgn[(1 − β)α + sf(1 − tp)(1 + z)] > 0                                                 (24) 

These results show us that, with all the assumptions assumed, the model continue stable as required. 

From this we conclude that our extension satisfied the stability conditions, as we present in Figure 2.  

Figure 2: Dynamic Equilibrium with an Open Economy. 

Source: Elaborated by the author. 

 

Equalizing  the  equation  (16)  and  (17),  we  determinate  the  value  of  the  equilibrium  β  to  our 

extension. Thus: 

 

 

[

sw
v

β∗ =

(1−tw)−x(1−c)gn][α+sf(1−tp)(1+z)−sw(1−tw)z]−[gn(1−x)+αr̅+gnz][cgn+sw(1−tw)]

(αgi−αr̅)[cgn+sw(1−tw)]+

sw
v

(1−tw)α−x(1−c)gnα

     (25) 

This expression determinates β when r = vr, as is presented in the Figure 2. An interesting issue 
about this stability analysis is that, if we consider a small increase in z, the equilibrium between r and vr 
does not modified, but the value of β∗ grows. Which means that the government will be forced to increase 
consumption (incentive to households) more than the profit to maintain the equilibrium condition in long-
run.17  

Note that some care is essential concerning the use of a Political Orientation based on the strategy 
of export-led growth. It is not difficult to raise the point that such approach necessarily suffers a fallacy of 
composition. Of course, not all countries can pursue export-led growth simultaneously, unless the domestic 
economy can expand as a result of a general international expansion of trade. We leave this issue to another 
opportunity in which we intend of deal with special requirements involving the relevant equations in the 

                                                           
17 It is possible to prove this affirmation, making a numerical exercise considering in the second extension z = 0 and 
increasing the value of  z.

simplified formal specifications from a behavioural perspective.  

 

5.  Concluding remarks 

The present paper contains three important issues. The first, presented in the second section is that 
kipping Charles (2007) hypotheses and correcting his mathematical mistakes, we have the same conclusion 
that favouring households, the impact continues to be negative in relation to the income distribution.  

As  a  second  issue,  we  presented  in  the  section  three  a  new  version  of  the  “Kaldor  neo-Pasinetti 
Theorem”  with  Political  Orientation.  One  relevant  contribution  of  this  part  of  our  article  is  that  the 
government can decide how much will be designated as incentives to profit (firms) and/or to consumption 
(households). As 0 ≤ β ≤ 1, our approach is relevant to the post-Keynesian theory since we consider a new 
way to deal with government decision: the interval of political choice given by β. Another accomplishment 
is that we established the difference between increased consumption by government expenditures and the 
natural consumption of the economy (Gi). Therefore, the impact of profit ratio is positive independently of 
the governmental choice.  

At the subsection 3.1 we present the stability of the model. From this we can conclude that in the 
long-run  the  extension  will  always  converge  to  equilibrium  in  steady-state.  This  new  extension  can  be 
linked to the neo-Kaleckian theory with respect to the wage-led growth model. 

As  was  showed  in  the  section  3  and  4,  it  is  important  to  think,  with  the intend  to  develop  some 
interesting ideas, show how is it possible to link the Kaldor-Passinetti and neo-Kaleckian views, as we can 
see in Fonseca and Araujo (2018), these models have lots of common principles. 

The  third  issue,  in  section  four,  is  an  extension  of  the  “Kaldor  neo-Pasinetti  Model”  with  Open 
Economy, government activities and Political Orientation. It shows that the globalization affect the income 
distribution. The existence of international financial system increase the valuation ratio, which is positive 
to the firms growing the value of their bonds by the introduction of foreign equities, one the other hand, 
decrease the profit rate, however, increase the value of β. Implying that, in this condition, it is necessary 
that the government  grow the incentive to  households to maintain the equilibrium. Especially  the latter, 
where we concluded that the profit ratio (with respect to foreign equities) has positive results. Subsection 
4.1 show us that our model with an Open Economy, as in the subsection 3.1 is also stable. We showed that 
our model can be connected with the export-led growth theory in the post-Kaleckian framework.

APPENDIX 2: THE CORRECT EQUATION OF INCENTIVE TO 

CONSUMPTION FOR CHARLES (2007) 

 
Considering the following assumptions: 
a)  Ge = α(C − C); 
b)  C = cw(1 − tw)W + (1 − sc)(1 − tp)P + cG  
 

Substituting  (a) in (b) we have: 

c)  C = cw(1 − tw)Y − cw(1 − tw)P + α(1 − sc)(1 − tp)P + αc(vr − x)I 
 

Considering the (xiv) and substituting  (c ) in (a): 

 

I + αC̅ − α[cw(1 − tw)Y − cw(1 − tw)P + α(1 − sc)(1 − tp)P + αc(vrw − x)I] =
sc(1 − tp)P + sw(1 − tw)Y − sw(1 − tw)P − c(vrw − x)I  

 

Dividing the equation per K:

sc(1 − tp)rw +

v

(1 − tw) − α(1 − tw)rw + α(1 − sc)(1 − tp)P + αc(vrw − x)gn =

Now considering  (9) equal to (d):

[xg + c(vrw − x)gn + sw(1 − tw)rw] =

(1−tw)
α(1 − tw)rw + α(1 − sc)(1 − tp)rw + αc(vrw − x)gn − sc(1 − tp)rw +

APPENDIX 3: MATHEMATICAL MANIPULATIONS OF OUR NEW 

EXTENSIONS 

 

 

a)  Extension without an Open Economy. 

Assuming the assumptions from Kaldor (1966) and Panico (1997) and considering 

the following new proposes: 

 

Ge = βα(C̅ − C) + (1 − β)α(P̅ − P)                                     (iA) 
0 ≤ β ≤ 1                                                                             (iiA) 
P̅ > 𝑃                                                                                   (iiiA) 
C̅ > 𝐶                                                                                  (ivA) 
C̅ = C + Gi                                                                            (vA) 

 

 

 
By saving and amount taxes function, we have: 

S = Sw + Sf = sf(1 − tp)P + sw(1 − tw)W − cG                     (vA) 
T = twW + tpP                                                                            (viA) 

 

Substituting (vA) in (iA): 

 

Ge = βα(Gi) + (1 − β)α(P̅ − P)                                      (1A) 

 

Substituting (1A) and (ix) in (xii), then dividing such equation by K given that: 

gn =

I

K

 ; r =

P

K

 ; r̅ =

P̅
K

 ; v =

K
  and  gi =

Y

Gi
K

  , it follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gn + (1 − β)αr̅ − (1 − β)αr + βαgi = sf(1 − tp)r +

sw
v

(1 − tw) − sw(1 − tw)r −
c(vr − x)gn    (2A) 

Isolating 

sw
v

 and rearranging the equation: 

sw
v

=

1

(1−tw)

[gn + (1 − β)αr̅ − (1 − β)αr + βαgi − sf(1 − tp)r + sw(1 − tw)r +
c(vr − x)gn]   (3A) 

Take into account (xiii), dividing the equation by K and isolating 

sw
v

, we obtain: 

sw
v

=

1

(1−tw)

[xgn + sw(1 − tw)r + c(vr − x)gn]                          (4A) 

Equating equations (3A) and (4A) and following steps (a) to (c), below, we obtain 

r expressed by equation (10):

(1−tw)

[gn + (1 − β)αr̅ − (1 − β)αr + βαgi − sf(1 − tp)r + sw(1 − tw)r +

c(vr − x)gn] =

(1−tw)

[gn + sw(1 − tw)r + c(vr − x)gn]  (a) 

gn + (1 − β)αr̅ − (1 − β)αr + βαgi − sf(1 − tp)r = xgn                    (b) 

gn(1 − x) + (1 − β)αr̅ + βαgi = r[(1 − β)α + sf(1 − tp)]                 (c ) 

r =

gn(1−x)+(1−β)αr̅+βαgi

[(1−β)α+sf(1−tp)]

                                                  (10) 

Substituting (10) in (4A) we obtain (11): 

 

sw
v

=

1

(1−tw)

[xgn + sw(1 − tw) [

gn(1−x)+(1−β)αr̅+βαgi

[(1−β)α+sf(1−tp)]

] + c(vr − x)gn]                

Isolate the vr : 

vr =

1
cgn

{

sw
v

(1 − tw) − sw(1 − tw) [

gn(1−x)+(1−β)αr̅+βαgi

[(1−β)α+sf(1−tp)]

] − x(1 − c)gn}            (11) 

 

b)  Extension with an Open Economy. 

Considering the assumption below: 

 

 

Y = W + P + F                                                   (iB) 

Being, F = iZ, i = r, the new assets are holding by firms and will be introduced 
in the general saving of an Open Economy impacting the aggregate investments. Let (iiB) 
be the saving function and (iiiB) the aggregate investment. Thus: 

 

S = Sw + Sf = sw(1 − tw)W + sf(1 − tp)(P + F) − cG              (iiB) 
AI = I + Ge + M − X + rZ                                             (iiiB) 

 

In equilibrium we have: 

 

I + Ge + X − M + rZ = Sw + Sf = sw(1 − tw)W + sf(1 − tp)(P + rZ) − cG    (ivB) 

 

 

19 

After some mathematical manipulation, as Appendix 2 (a). By substituting (1A), 

(ix) and (iB) in (ivB), we obtain: 

 

 

⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡I + βα(Gi) + (1 − β)α(P̅ − P) + X − M + rZ = Sw + Sf = sw(1 − tw)W +
sf(1 − tp)(P + rZ) − c(vr − x)I     (1B) 

That is, how the government can be allowed to choose the percentage designated 

to  the  Political  Orientation.  Dividing  the  equation  (1B)  by  K,  considering: 
X−M

= (gn − i)z , isolating 

 we have: 

K

K

sw(1 − tw)r + sw(1 − tw)rz + c(vr − x)gn]    (2B) 

Equalizing  (2B)  with  (4A),  after  some  algebraic  manipulations  we  obtain  the 

profit rate (18): 

 

1

1−tw

⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡

[gn + (1 − β)αr̅ − (1 − β)αr + βαgi + gnz − sf(1 − tp)r − sf(1 − tp)rz +

(1−tw)

[xgn + sw(1 − tw)r + c(vr −

sw(1 − tw)r + sw(1 − tw)rz + c(vr − x)gn] =
x)gn]  

 

⁡∴ gn + (1 − β)αr̅ − (1 − β)αr + βαgi + gnz − r[sf(1 − tp) + sf(1 − tp)z − sw(1 −
tw)z] = xgn  

 

 

∴ ⁡r =

gn(1−x)+(1−β)αr̅+βαgi+gnz

(1−β)α+sf(1−tp)(1+z)−sw(1−tw)z

                                           (18) 

But the Kaldor neo-Pasinetti model also presents the valuation ratio. Substituting 

(18) in (1A), after some mathematical procedure we obtain (19): 

 

=

] + c(vr − x)gn}  

 ∴ ⁡cvr =

] − x(1 − c)gn          

                              

∴ vr =
