Abstract

We move forward in identifying the causes of the marked and systematic reduction in the
homicide rate in S˜ao Paulo state in the 2000s. Its main objective was that of investigating
the role of the criminal organization PCC in this process. We constructed a ﬁrst-diﬀerence
ﬁxed eﬀects model with a spatial structure where we controlled for various socioeconomic and
demographic measures and for the presence of ﬁrearms and law-enforcement, among other
measures. We found no statistical evidence that the presence and strength of the PCC played
a signiﬁcant role in explaining the variation in the homicide rate.

1. Introduction

After 1999, there was a decrease in the homicide rate in the state of S˜ao Paulo. This
decrease occurred in about 500 out of a total of 645 municipalities. Until 2015, the decre-
ase had reached 80.9% and constituted one of the most important cases of crime reduction
worldwide. However, the reasons that contributed to this notable performance are not com-
pletely understood and still remain somewhat of a Mistery, above all because the 2000’s were
prodigal of transformations in politics, economy, society, and legislation.

Indeed, there were countless changes not only nationally, but also regionally. Nationally,
the debate about public security policies deepened and widened in scope. The Federal Go-
vernment took on part of the responsibility for this issue, launching the 1st National Public

Security Plan before the date scheduled for its launch in response to the death of the teacher
Geisa in the famous “Bus 174” incident in July 2000, which caused a national uproar. Also
for the ﬁrst time, the issue of public security took center stage in the debate around the
municipal elections that were held in that same year. Since then, the number of munici-
pal guards has increased signiﬁcantly throughout the country. Social conditions improved
systematically: there were gradual increases in per capita income, the unemployment rate
dropped, income inequality decreased, and school coverage and attendance rates went up. In
legislative terms, the Disarmament Statute was enacted at the end of 2003, putting a brake
on the true arms race observed in previous decades. Finally, during that decade, the country
witnessed the beginning of a deep change in the demographic regime, made possible by an
increase in life expectancy and a substantial reduction in fertility rates, which meant that
the proportion of young people began to decrease in some regions.

At the state level, S˜ao Paulo was one of the few federative units that achieved continuity
in governmental management, with the same party5 at the head of the state government
since 1995. During that period, many innovations were made in the area of public security,
which included more intensive use of technology and managerial reorganization, engendering
a substantial increase in incarceration rates. At the same time, some municipalities started
taking a more active role in public security, when they adopted the alcohol prohibition policy
(dry law ) in the wake of good results achieved in the city of Diadema.

Last but not least was the growth of the prison population, which facilitated the luring
of prisoners to join the Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), a criminal organization that
was born within the prison system and became nationally known after orchestrating and
perpetrating hundreds of attacks in May 2006. The cartelization of the retail drug market
under the leadership of the PCC would therefore be one of many hypotheses used to explain
the Mistery of the reduction in homicides in S˜ao Paulo.

In this complex context, the main objective of this paper is to develop an empirical
methodology to test the hypothesis that the PCC cartel had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
drop in the homicide rate in the state of S˜ao Paulo in the 2000’s.

This study contributes to the literature that attempts to explain the decline in homicide
rates in S˜ao Paulo during the 2000’s, and to the literature on criminal organizations and
their impact on criminal behavior. Speciﬁcally, we focus on the behavior of the PCC cartel.
While previous work has focused on this criminal organization, we provide a more standard
econometric approach to thinking about the eﬀect of this organization on the “Mistery” of
the decline in homicide rates in S˜ao Paulo.

This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the study area, the “S˜ao
Paulo Mistery” and quantitative and qualitative studies that looked into the possible causes
of homicide reduction in S˜ao Paulo. In this section we also discuss the economic context of
organized crime and pay special attention to the so-called “PCC hypothesis”. In Section 3,
we brieﬂy discuss the proxy variable we use for the presence and power of the PCC in the
state of S˜ao Paulo, our empirical model, identiﬁcation strategy, and the data sources that
were used. Section 4 shows results. In the Section 5 we presents ﬁve facts inconsistent with
the PCC hypothesis. We conclude the article in Section 6, where we presents the limitations
of inferences.

assumed the government after the resignation of Governor Geraldo Alkmin.

2. Backgroud and previous studies

2.1. Organized crime and violence

According to McCarthy (2013)), it is diﬃcult to determine a general theory for organized
crime. In Lampe (2016), for example, we ﬁnd 180 deﬁnitions of “organized crime” in the
world. Their origins, structures, and modus operandi diﬀer signiﬁcantly. The only certainty
we have is that they are organized and that their business is based on an illegal activity of
what kind or another.

Their origin lies fundamentally in the state’s lack of power to guarantee law enforcement
and criminal justice (Fiorentini and Peltzman, 1997; Skaperdas, 2001; McCarthy, 2013).
Bandiera (2003) mentions that the Sicilian maﬁa emerged from the Italian agrarian reform
to guarantee protection and property rights to the population. In another way, the presence
of the state can also contribute to the development of criminal organizations by prohibiting
the production and distribution of certain high-demand goods and services with attractive
proﬁtability (Kumar and Skaperdas, 2008).

Criminal organizations are actually corporations working rationally with a wide variety
of businesses ranging from micro-traﬃcking and theft to highly complex transnational crime
organizations engaged in activities such as money laundering, drug traﬃcking, and corrup-
tion. Their predominant structure is hierarchical (Levitt and Venkatesh, 2000; McCarthy,
2013). Like any organization, the principles of loyalty, motivation, and proﬁt-making are
desirable requirements. However, there is no way to turn to the police or legal system in
the face of contractual or ﬁnancial conﬂicts in their business chain (Kumar and Skaperdas,
2008). Despite this, the validity of contracts can be much more eﬀective, since penalties tend
to be more severe and often carried out through violence.

Just as in the legal market, we can expect new players to join in if illegal activities generate
proﬁt. According to economic theory, breaking a monopoly or increasing competition leads
to greater eﬃciency. However, this peaceful balance may not occur, given the culture of using
violence against rival organizations (Kumar and Skaperdas, 2008). In Mexico, for example,
the homicide rate grew by about 1.000% between 2006 and 2010. The main explanation lies
in the war for territory between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels (Dudley, 2014). According
to Bouchard and Wilkins (2010), the Nash equilibrium for these conﬂicts would occur in a
structure similar to monopolistic competition, with each group acting in speciﬁc regions. The
distribution of Colombian cocaine in cities in the United States, for example, was divided by
agreements between the Cali and Medellin cartels that remained in force for a certain period
(Clawson and Lee III, 1996).

The same holds true when dealing with legal authorities such as law enforcement and the
judiciary. If they are not in the way of their business, by accepting bribes, there is balance
without violence. Otherwise, Daniele and Marani (2011) point out that there is a trend of
more active corruption or even bomb attacks and arson, with the aim of drawing the attention
of political agents.

If there is balance, the culture of criminal organizations of using violence diﬀers according
to their characteristics, to the environment, and also to the type of crime. The Medell´ın
Cartel, for example, was led by Pablo Escobar, who employed plenty of violence to achieve his
goals. The Cali Cartel, which succeeded the Medell´ın Cartel, employed virtually no violence
as a strategy so as not to draw the attention of the authorities (McCarthy, 2013). In addition
to these examples, consolidating a criminal organization into a multi-gang environment can
also lead to order, as a result of regulating property rights and security services. This can be
veriﬁed in Biondi (2014), who observes the beneﬁts cited by the residents of the presence of
organized crime in favelas in the city of S˜ao Paulo, Brazil. Speciﬁc crimes such as violence
against women and rape are also expected to decrease, since the principle of respect for
women is observed by many of these organizations (McCarthy, 2013). Given this diversity,

3

it is diﬃcult to determine a general pattern, resulting in the need to analyze violence and its
consequences on a case-by-case basis.

2.2. The “S˜ao Paulo Mistery”

According to data from the Public Security Secretariat of the State S˜ao Paulo (Secretaria
de Seguran¸ca P´ublica, SSP-SP ) and from the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics
(Instituto Brasileiro de Geograﬁa e Estat´ıstica, IBGE ), the state of S˜ao Paulo had a rate of 44
homicides per 100,000 population in 1999, while the national average was 26.2. This placed
the state of S˜ao Paulo among the most violent regions of the world (United Nations Oﬃce
on drugs and crime, 2006). In 2012, the rate fell to 11.5, below the regional average in the
Americas (28.5) but still above the world average (6.7) (World Health Organization, 2014).
Following this trend, in 2015 the rate was 8.4 (SSP-SP, 2016). The “S˜ao Paulo Mistery”
resulted from this gradual and uninterrupted drop in the homicide rate (Fig. 1). As in the
case of New York (see Levitt, 2004), scholars are intent on understanding the causes of this
Mistery for the state of S˜ao Paulo.

2.3. The PCC hypothesis

The PCC is the largest and most famous criminal organization in Brazil. It was initially
established in the prison system of the state of S˜ao Paulo and gradually took command of all
prisons in the country due to the lack of presence of the state and for the purpose of ensuring
better incarceration conditions for inmates (Biondi, 2009). In 1993, one of the founders of

mistreatment and of regulating what inmates could do or not (Biondi, 2009).

The existence of the PCC was only oﬃcially recognized in 2000, based on an investigation
carried out by the Secretariat for Penitentiary Administration. From that time onward, the
transfer of its main leaders to other prisons outside the state only helped to spread the
principles of the organization throughout the country (Biondi, 2009). The ﬁrst display of
power of the organization occurred in 2001, when rebellions took place in 29 prisons in the
state of S˜ao Paulo. The wide coverage of the mass media and the success of the rebellions
strengthened the PCC culture in urban areas as well (Biondi, 2009). It was in May 2006,
after 765 prisoners were transferred to a maximum security unit, including the PCC leader,
that the organization carried out its most calamitous action. According to Cano and Alvadia
(2008), there were 84 rebellions in prisons throughout Brazil, 74 of which in the state of S˜ao
Paulo, as well as 300 attacks on public facilities, 84 buses set on ﬁre, 17 attacks on bank
branches, and more than 500 dead among civilians and the military. The PCC is present in
all the national territory and in some countries in Latin America, acting in robberies, bank
robberies, and arms and drug traﬃcking. The Brazilian Public Prosecutor’s Oﬃce estimates
that the organization’s monthly revenue in 2015 amounted to 16 million reals.

The ﬁeld of empirical research in criminology is eminently multidisciplinary, and one
in which diﬀerent traditions, methods, and approaches, both quantitative and qualitative,
coexist. As Weber said, no methodology is a priori better than another. Diﬀerent methods
can and should be recommended for diﬀerent analyses, depending on the goal of the research,
as well as on the constraints involved in obtaining information. Nevertheless, the approaches
can be compared with regard to the criteria of internal and external validation of a hypothesis
that one wishes to put to the test.

Research with high internal validation will be able to refute alternative hypotheses, avoi-
ding spurious correlations that concur to a mistaken understanding of a given phenomenon.
On the other hand, external validation oﬀers greater guarantee that the results obtained can
be generalized to a population and are not dependent on a sample or particular situation.

In an ethnographic research, Biondi (2009) provides evidence that the transformations
brought about by the PCC were very beneﬁcial to detainees, as the creation of order avoided
physical assaults and sexual violence and ensured respect for the material goods of each of
its members. In addition to the fact that it created internal order, the PCC hypothesis is
substantiated by the idea that many murders that took place in territories competed for and
other criminal acts committed for revenge, settling of scores, etc., would no longer be accepted
by the central command of the organization without prior and categorical authorization.
A single paper (Biderman et al., 2010) employing a quantitative approach measured the
alleged impact of the PCC. These authors found that the power of this criminal organization
accounted for approximately 7% of the decrease in homicides in the slums in the capital of
S˜ao Paulo state controlled by the PCC. On the other hand, numerous ethnographic studies
concluded that there was a notable eﬀect of the actions of the PCC as a leading actor in
reducing homicides in S˜ao Paulo. Ethnographic analysis and interviews with the actors
involved were the empirical basis of those studies. Despite the richness of details and the
deeper understanding of the social connections involved in the phenomenon that those studies
provided, there are intrinsic limits to the ethnographic method in terms of extrapolating
conclusions to show generalized causal eﬀects. We are not disqualifying this research, let
alone saying that the group had no bearing on the reduction in homicides. We only argue
that this inﬂuence and its real weight have not been conﬁrmed. It is possible that the role
played by the PCC in the imagination of people living in suburbs, journalists, and researchers
is much greater than its actual role in explaining the phenomenon.

The most incisive defense of the PCC hypothesis is one made by Willis (2015), an anth-

5

ropologist who studied homicides in S˜ao Paulo between 2009 and 2012, following the work of
DHPP policemen and interviewing residents from the outskirts of the capital. Although very
rich in the description of the faction’s functioning and of the moral arguments constructed by
the actors involved to justify who can kill and who must die, that study puts forward a weak
argument when it tries to argue that the decrease in homicides in S˜ao Paulo was mainly due
to the PCC and that law enforcement, known for its ineﬃciency, would have little relation
with the phenomenon.

It should be noted, however, that the author carried out his research only in the city
of S˜ao Paulo, speciﬁcally in some favelas in the capital where the PCC was active, and as
we have seen, the decrease in homicides was widespread in the state, occurring in most of
its municipalities. The author assumes that most homicides are premeditated and that the
faction can therefore avoid them. It is also assumed that the faction exerts its inﬂuence not
only among the members of the group and in communities, but also in all other contexts.
This approach holds the erroneous assumption that the only way that authorities can aﬀect
the homicide rate is through investigations carried out by the DHPP. This agency deals
only with homicides by unknown criminals that occurred in the city of S˜ao Paulo, which
causes bias in the research. The decrease in other types of crime in the state over the same
period, such as vehicle robbery/theft and robbery followed by homicide, is not considered
and cannot suﬃciently explain the decrease in interpersonal homicides. The author still does
not acknowledge the inﬂuence of the power of the state in the process, even though there
is empirical evidence that public security policy has also played a major role in reducing
homicides.

Some quantitative studies were developed to test various hypotheses with the aim of
explaining the cause of the decrease in homicides in S˜ao Paulo. Table 1 summarizes some of
those studies.

It is worth mentioning that, whereas quantitative methods are generally useful for testing
hypotheses, having as their ultimate methodological concern the principles of simplicity and
internal and external validation, qualitative methods, and ethnographic work in particular,
seek to obtain a deeper understanding about, and a detailed description of, certain social
relations; and about values and beliefs that guide the actions of individuals. On the other
hand, the very nature of qualitative research does not lend itself to the objective of internal
and external validation of hypotheses, also because the individuals observed are part of a
particular social context and their beliefs and values are limited to their set of information
and experiences.

In the quantitative studies listed here, the authors conﬁrmed hypotheses about the impor-
tance of certain factors that contributed to the general decrease in homicides in S˜ao Paulo.
These include: the disarmament policy, improvements in socio-economic conditions, incre-
ased school attendance among young people, a decrease in the proportion of young people
in the population, technological and organizational innovations in public security manage-
ment (such as the Infocrim system), and a decline in the crack epidemic cycle. At the same
time, De Mello and Schneider (2010) found local eﬀects of the implementation of the alcohol
prohibition policy (dry law ) in some municipalities.

Cerqueira (2014) shows that the Disarmament Statute was eﬀective in reducing the homi-
cide rate in the state of S˜ao Paulo, and that a decrease of 1% in guns in the hands of citizens
reduced the homicide rate by approximately 2%. The evidence found by Justus and Kassouf
(2013) reveal that the Disarmament Statute reduced the rate of lethal crimes (homicide and
robbery followed by homicide) in the capital, reinforcing the ﬁndings of that study. They
also highlighted the role of improved economic conditions leading to better law enforcement
performance in reducing the rate of lethal crimes in the capital of S˜ao Paulo state. Cabral
(2016) found a strong eﬀect of the adoption of new public security technologies in the state
of S˜ao Paulo in her evaluation of the impact of the Infocrim system. The author argues that
this police information system was responsible for an average reduction of 8.4 in the homicide
rate per one hundred thousand population, avoiding 3,472 homicides from its implementation
in 2003 until 2010.

3. Method

3.1. The study area

Figure 2 shows the study area within Brazil: the state of S˜ao Paulo.

It is located in
Brazil’s southeast region and consists of 645 municipalities, 39 of which are located in the
metropolitan area called Greater S˜ao Paulo, and the capital city of S˜ao Paulo. The state
has a population of 44 million and generates about a third of all the wealth produced in the
Brazilian economy. The city of S˜ao Paulo has a population of 11.2 million and accounts for
about 12% of Brazil’s GDP and for 36% of all the goods and services produced in the state.
The metropolitan region of S˜ao Paulo constitutes one of the 10 largest metropolises in the
world.

3.2. Proxy for the PCC’s power

Some variables can be measured directly, such as the existence of a civil guard corps or
the implementation of alcohol prohibition measures in the municipality. Others, however,
are either non-observable (treated here as ﬁxed eﬀects) or are only observable through proxy
variables. This is the case, for example, of the prevalence of ﬁrearms and the power of the
PCC.

In the case of ﬁrearms, the recent literature has used the proportion of suicides committed
with ﬁrearms as proxy variables. This indicator has been shown to be related to the possession

8

of weapons at home reported in victim surveys and other indicators related to weapons (see
Cerqueira, 2014).

In the case of the PCC, we cannot even count its members in the municipality or measure
its intensity of membership. Therefore, to measure the mobilizing power of the PCC in
a municipality, we used the number of attacks perpetrated in May 2006. Although the
faction had been born earlier, it was only during those events that it really showed its power
outside the walls of prisons and became nationally known and feared. In those weeks, the
organization’s leaders overtly requested its members from outside prisons to organize attacks
on police, even threatening to death those who did not comply.

Although it is not possible to directly observe the power of the PCC within a municipality,
since the events of May 2006 were the largest display of the power of the PCC in the state of
S˜ao Paulo, we assume that the number of attacks is a good indirect indicator of the mobilizing
capacity of the group in those municipalities. In short, it is an indirect measure of where the
group is more or less active.

As it was an extreme moment when, in theory, all the resources of the faction were
deployed, we argue that the number of attacks can somehow capture the mobilizing capacity
of the PCC in a municipality. So, if the PCC plays a role in pushing the homicide rate down
in the state of S˜ao Paulo, we expect this decrease be more pronounced in municipalities where
the faction has shown that it can actually act in practice.

We point out that the proxy variable applied to measuring the power of the PCC was
validated externally by another indirect indicator of the faction’s power: the number of
drug traﬃcking events reported to the Disque Den´uncia (Crime Hotline). Using data from
municipal police records in that same year (2006), we found a very high correlation – greater
than 0.9 – between the number of attacks and the number of reports.6

6The data are from an internal survey done at the time by the Public Security Secretariat of S˜ao Paulo

based on data from the Crime Hotline.

Let y and x ≡ (x1, x2, . . . , xk) be the observable random variables, and let α be an
unobservable random variable. We can observe y and x in two periods t before and after the
attacks of the PCC, respectively period 1 and period 2. We assume that α is constant in
time, i.e. that it has a ﬁxed unobservable eﬀect.

We used the number of attacks per one hundred thousand population perpetrated in May
2006 (PCC/population) as a proxy variable for the power of the PCC in municipalities in
S˜ao Paulo. This variable, along with the other control variables, are contained in vector x.
Alternatively, we checked the stability of the results by replacing this measure with another
one in which the denominator is population density (total population divided by total area).
Response variable is the homicide rate per one hundred thousand population (homicide).
We measured this rate from the average of the previous four years (2002-2005) and then (from
2007 to 2010) from the wave of PCC attacks in 2006. The intention is to reduce the inﬂuence
of exogenous shocks that may have aﬀected the rate in some of the state’s municipalities. In
the initial period, no city was attacked. In the second period, however, 16.3% of the cities
within the state were attacked (109 cities).

Assuming a linear model in the form of error, with α entering additionally along with xj,

we have:

homicidet = β0 + xβ + α + εt

(1)

We assume E(x(cid:48)

where the interest lies in vector K × 1, and by deﬁnition, E(εt|xt, α) = 0 for t = 1, 2.
tεt) (cid:54)= 0 for t = 1, 2. However, with T = 2, Eq. (1) can be diﬀerentiated
to eliminate the non-observable time-constant variable, α. So ∆homicide = homicide2 −
homicide1, ∆x = x2 − x1 and ∆ε = ε2 − ε1. Therefore, Eq. (1) is just a standard linear
cross-sectional equation in the ﬁrst diﬀerence of all variables. The intercept is excluded, but
we included an intercept in the equation in diﬀerences, δ, to control for the time trend (in
the original model), since δt − δ(t − 1) = δ. Hence the estimable model is:

∆homicide = δ + ∆xβ + ∆ε

(2)

Therefore, the so-called ﬁrst-diﬀerence estimator (FD) is an MQO estimator of the ∆yi
regression over ∆xi for i = 1, 2, . . . , N , where i is the number of municipalities in the state
of S˜ao Paulo.

According to Becker (1968), any individual can be a potential criminal. The rational
choice will depend on the individual’s characteristics related to the expectation of returns
from criminal activity, his or her degree of risk aversion, and also the opportunity cost
represented by the returns in the legal market. The exogenous variables are related to the
severity of punishment and to the probability of failure in the activity. In other words, the
individual compares the returns from illegal activity with those obtained in the legal market,
given the variables of law enforcement and criminal justice. Ehrlich’s (1973) extension of
Becker’s model includes the decision of temporal allocation of criminal activity, so that the
decision between the legal and illegal markets is not exclusive.

Law enforcement and criminal justice were controlled for by: the existence of a municipal
police force (municipal guards), expressed by a binary variable that takes the value of 1
if the municipality possesses a municipal guard corps and 0 if it does not; the existence of
prisons (prisons), expressed by a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if the municipality
has at least 1 penal institution and 0 otherwise; the passage of the alcohol prohibition law
(dry law), with a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if the municipality adopted the
law and 0 for those that did not, and the establishment of the Infocrim system (Infocrim),
with a binary variable that takes the value of 1 in the municipalities where the system was set

10

up between 1999 and 2010 and 0 for the others. According to Becker’s model, we expected
enhanced law enforcement and criminal justice as represented by these variables to reduce
beneﬁts and incentives for criminal behavior.

Household income per capita (household income) was used as a measure of return from
criminal activity. For the opportunity cost, we included two socioeconomic conditions: per-
centage of the economically active population aged 18 years or more that was unemployed7
(unemployment); the ratio between the number of people in the age group from 6 to 17 years
attending basic education (primary school and high school – regular or serial); and the total
population in that same age bracket multiplied by 100 (school attendance).8 In addition,
we controlled for the demographic conditions that potentially inﬂuence homicide rates in
municipalities: the ratio between the number of males in the 15-29 age group and the total
population multiplied by 100 (young men) and the percentage of the population living in
urban areas (urban).

In addition, two variables were included in the empirical model in order to control for
exogenous changes that are part of the “S˜ao Paulo Mistery” and had a bearing on the decrease
in the homicide rate and, as a result, on the rational decision of agents to commit crimes. The
proxy for alcohol consumption follows the same strategy adopted by various authors, such as
Pridemore (2004), Stickley and Carlson (2005) and Razvodovsky (2008), among others. This
variable was calculated by the ration between the number of people who were killed by alcohol
poisoning and the population of the municipality multiplied by 100,000. It is, therefore, the
rate of deaths caused by alcohol consumption for every 100,000 population (alcohol). The
proxy used for ﬁrearms was the proportion of suicides with guns to total suicides (guns).
There is a profusion of international evidence that validates this proxy and indicates that it
is so far the best indirect measure for the prevalence of ﬁrearms in the analyzed locations
(see Kleck, 2004; Killias, 1993; Briggs and Tabarrok, 2014, and others).

3.4. Data

The data for the number of PCC attacks carried out in May 2006 come from an internal
survey done at the time by the Public Security Secretariat of the State of S˜ao Paulo (SSP-SP)
based on police records. The data about the establishment of the Infocrim system were also
provided by that Secretariat.

Data about homicides, suicide by ﬁrearms, and alcohol poisoning9 were obtained from
the Mortality Information System of the Ministry of Health, which follows the 10th revision
of the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases.

Data about municipalities where the alcohol prohibition law was adopted are from the
Metropolitan Forum on Public Security. Data about the number of prisons are from the
Secretariat for Penitentiary Administration of the State of S˜ao Paulo. For the other variables
we used the 2000 and 2010 demographic censuses carried out by the IBGE.

4. Results

In Table 2, there are ﬁve diﬀerent speciﬁcations. We calculated robust errors according

to heretocedastidity.

month.

8People from 6 to 17 years old attending preschool have been considered as if they were in the ﬁrst grade of
primary school. People from 6 to 17 years old attending the third grade of high school have been considered
to have completed that level.

9In this set, the following subcategories of cause of death were included, according to ICD-10: E244; F04;
F100 a F109; G312; K852; K860; P043; R780; T519; X450 a X459; X650 a X659; Y150 a Y159; Y909 a Y919

The ﬁrst speciﬁcation, shown in column (1), has neither the proxy for the presence and
power of the PCC nor the other variables, for which we cannot guarantee strict exogeneity.
The next speciﬁcation, shown in column (2), contains the variable of interest in this study:
number of attacks per one hundred thousand population perpetrated in May 2006, that is,
the variable labeled as PCC/population. It is clear that the results of the model of column
(1) are stable even after that variable is included, which indicates that they are robust with
respect to this issue. However, we don’t see any statistical signiﬁcance in the proxy for the
criminal organization within the state of S˜ao Paulo. In the speciﬁcation of column (3), we
replace this measure of PCC performance with the alternative measure, where demographic
density is used as the denominator. Again, we show the stability of the coeﬃcients of control
variables in relation to the two previous models. The proxy variable for the PCC, however,
was signiﬁcant at 10% (zero is contained within the 95% conﬁdence interval, delimited by
−119.49 and 9.13).

The next step was to include proxies to control for the role of ﬁrearms diﬀusion, the
workings of public security forces, and the socioeconomic and demographic conditions that
hypothetically aﬀect the homicide rate. It is worth remembering that these regressors were
not included in the three previous speciﬁcations because we cannot guarantee the strict
exogeneity of these regressors. Nevertheless, in addition to a change in the magnitude of the

coeﬃcients, we show that urbanization is the only factor that ceases to have a statistically
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the homicide rate with the inclusion of these controls. We found no
statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of PCC attacks, regardless of the measure used to denote the
number of attacks perpetrated by the criminal organization.

We found an additional diﬃculty in empirical modeling when we placed on a map of
S˜ao Paulo the spatial distribution of several factors that may be related to the reduction in
homicides. In addition to temporal synchronicity, the maps suggested that there is also a
spatial overlapping of several variables.

The decrease in homicides was more pronounced in municipalities located in the metro-
politan regions of S˜ao Paulo state, Campinas and Santos, being smaller in the interior of
the state. A Local Indicator of Spatial Analysis (LISA), reinforced by the I -Moran indica-
tor, clearly suggested that there is spatial contiguity among municipalities with the highest
reductions as well as among those with the lowest reductions. It became clear – and was
corroborated by many previous studies on spatial eﬀects on crime – that it is necessary to
control for spatial dependence in the identiﬁcation of the alleged determinants of the homicide
rate.

The alcohol prohibition law, known as dry law, was adopted only in some municipalities
located in the metropolitan region of S˜ao Paulo. There is a large concentration of prisons in
those areas, which are also the most urbanized and wealthiest in the state. There was also
more crime in those metropolitan regions, and municipalities that set up civil guard corps
are also concentrated in them. The Infocrim system and several other management systems
and practices were adopted earlier in those regions and much of the PCC mobilization in
2006 occurred in the same municipalities.

In addition to the overlapping of and interactions among factors, it is quite likely that
there will be spillover or contagion eﬀects. A municipality that sets up a civil guard corps or
adopts the alcohol prohibition law probably aﬀects not only its own territory, but also those of
neighboring cities. The same can be said of the Infocrim system and other innovations. And
these eﬀects can be negative (when they simply transfer crime from one place to another) or
positive (when they contribute to deterrence of, and decrease in, crime in contiguous areas).
Just as the temporal correlation between two events does not imply causation, neither does
spatial coincidence. To circumvent problems of spatial correlations, we control for the spatial
lag of the homicide rate by applying a rook space contiguity matrix. In fact, when applying
spatial autocorrelation tests to both the error term and the dependent variable, we diagnosed
the presence of spatial dependence in the dependent variable (p = 0.035 in the LM test).
Therefore, the spatially-lagged homicide rate (Whomicide) was included in all ﬁve previously
estimated models. The results of these estimates are shown in Table 3.

In short, we observed a moderate reduction in the magnitude of the eﬀects of the control
variables and the signiﬁcance of the proxy for the spread of ﬁrearms, with the expected
positive sign based on the cited literature. And, once again, no statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect
was found for both measures used for the attacks.

For socioeconomic variables, all results are in line with Becker’s (1968) theoretical model.
The crime rate varies positively with the number of young people, since these individuals
have a low opportunity cost when compared to others. This is due to inexperience and
low schooling, since they are still in a period of accumulation of human capital. There is
also a positive relation with the level of unemployment, since the opportunity cost increases
for individuals with no income from work. The proportion of children aged between 6 and
17 attending school reduces the occurrence of crimes, corroborating the positive eﬀect of
education (see Lochner and Moretti, 2004). Household income was included as a proxy to
represent the expected return on criminal activity and, as expected, increased income makes
the decision to commit a crime less attractive.

14

Regarding the variables for law enforcement and criminal justice, represented by the
presence of municipal guards, the alcohol prohibition law and the existence of prisons, all
estimated coeﬃcients were statistically signiﬁcant, raising the cost of committing crimes and,
consequently, inhibiting such practices. Finally, for the control variables entered according
to the “S˜ao Paulo Mistery”, we corroborated the evidence of the relationship between more
weapons and crimes established by Justus and Kassouf (2013), Cerqueira and De Mello (2013)
and Cerqueira (2014), besides the importance of using new technologies in the state of S˜ao
Paulo (Infocrim), as found by Cabral (2016).

5. Facts inconsistent with the PCC hypothesis

There are ﬁve stylized facts about homicide reduction in S˜ao Paulo that, even if they are
not inconsistent with the idea that the PCC cartel played a leading role in explaining the
phenomenon, at least cast doubt on its importance.

The ﬁrst aspect, as pointed out above, is that the decrease in homicides in the state of
S˜ao Paulo occurred in 500 of the 645 of the state’s municipalities, as highlighted in Figure
3, when we compare the average rates from 2002 to 2005 – before the wave of PCC attacks
– with the 2007-2010 average after the attacks in 2006. The homicide rate dropped much
beyond the municipalities where the PCC is supposed to have minimal organization, as the
map of PCC attacks carried out in May 2006 shows (Fig. 4).

Another point, perhaps the central one, as shown in Fig. 5, is that the homicide rate
began to fall in the state of S˜ao Paulo and in the state capital in 1999, many years before
the importance of the criminal organization, which became nationally known after the 2006
attacks, was recognized.

Third, homicides were not the only crimes to fall in the period. Since 1999, there has
been a sharp decline in rates of crime against property that are the least likely to be left
unreported, such as robbery followed by homicide and robbery or theft of vehicles (Fig.
5). Is the reduction in these crimes of strictly economic motivation also due to the PCC?
This hypothesis is obviously untenable. This in a way weakens the PCC hypothesis and
strengthens the hypotheses of the eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of public security policies.

The fourth fact concerns data on the characteristics of victims. Their analysis showed
that violent deaths decreased not only among young, low-schooled men living in suburbs –
a proﬁle similar to those involved in crimes – but also in populations with very diﬀerent
proﬁles.

Finally, the ﬁfth fact is that a considerable proportion of homicides have elements that
associate incidents with causes of an interpersonal nature, as suggested by the signiﬁcant
presence of alcohol in the blood of the victims and the concentration of cases in the early
hours of the morning on weekends (see Gawryszewski et al., 2005).

Even with these obvious facts, the ethnographic literature suggests a possible inﬂuence of
the PCC “courts” on homicides, which must be expressly authorized by its central command.
One would expect the control of deaths by organized crime to be felt more intensely in the
mid-2000’s, when the ﬁrst signs that the organization was growing appeared, culminating in
the display of its full power in the events of May 2006. However, as we have emphasized
here, the decrease in homicides in S˜ao Paulo started back in the 1990’s, spreading virtually
to the whole state, and the proﬁle and contextual elements of the lives that were not lost
diﬀer from what would be expected from homicides associated to drug traﬃcking. On the
other hand, references in qualitative studies have not made any mention to crimes or events
linked to property, which underwent a concomitant decrease.

It is clear that such stylized facts do not constitute any evidence that the PCC courts
have not had a role in reducing homicides in S˜ao Paulo. On the other hand, such a framework

15

contradicts the idea that the decrease in homicides in both the capital and in the state as a
whole can be mainly attributed to the PCC. In order to test the hypothesis that the PCC
cartel had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the aggregate homicide rate in the state of S˜ao Paulo,
we produced the model shown in the next section, in which we include controls for many of
the elements mentioned in the literature and that may have played a role in reducing violent
deaths.

6. Concluding remarks

The Mistery about the causes that explain the substantial decline in the homicide rate in
S˜ao Paulo in the 2000s continues to attract the attention of scholars and policy makers. In
this article, we sought to improve our understanding of the phenomenon.

We reviewed some non-exclusive hypotheses discussed in qualitative and quantitative stu-
i) increased eﬃciency of police work; ii) better social and economic
dies, which highlight:
conditions; iii) strong disarmament policy implemented by the state and above all reinforced
by the intervention of the Disarmament Statute in December 2003; iv) substantial demo-
graphic change through the reduction in the proportion of young people in the population,
so that less potential victims and potential criminals move throughout the state; v) increase
in the rate of school attendance of children and young people; vi) implementation of new
technologies, such as the Infocrim system, Copon-online and Disque Den´uncia (Crime Ho-
tline); vii) strong action by the PCC criminal organization as a violence-moderating agent.
It was on this last hypothesis that we based the evidence we present in this paper.

In this context, we believe that we have made progress in identifying the causes of the
marked and uninterrupted decline in homicides in the state of S˜ao Paulo in the 2000’s, seeking
to empirically estimate the role of the PCC, as was done by Biderman et al. (2015).

We found no statistical evidence that the presence and power of the PCC played any role
in the variation in the homicide rate recorded during the period in question. Our results do
not support the PCC hypothesis at the level of the state of S˜ao Paulo. They corroborate,

however, the results of previous empirical studies on the role of labor market conditions (Jus-
tus and Kassouf, 2013; Cerqueira and Moura, 2015; Dix Carneiro et al., 2016); demographic
change (De Mello and Schneider, 2010; Cerqueira and Moura, 2014); Infocrim (Cabral, 2016);
decrease in the circulation of ﬁrearms (Hartung, 2009; Cerqueira, 2014; Justus and Kassouf,
2013); increased school attendance rate (Chioda et al., 2015; Cerqueira and Moura, 2015);
and the alcohol prohibition law (Biderman et al., 2010).

It is worth emphasizing some aspects related to other results found in this study. First,
municipalities began to act more intensely in public security in the last decade, when they
created the municipal guard corps. The increase in the number of municipal guards not
only allowed for a large contingent of the Military Police to be displaced from activities such
as those related to the preservation of public property and the ordering of vehicle traﬃc,
but reﬂects, above all, a greater concern with public security on the part of municipalities.
Apparently, the indicator for the presence of municipal guards was able to capture some
partial eﬀect of this variable in determining the homicide rate. Nevertheless, more in-depth
analysis of the subject is needed. Second, Infocrim is a criminal georeferencing system with
Business Intelligence (BI) features inspired by the New York’s Compstat system. More than
a computer program, it launched a new form of management and allocation of police resources
based on statistical information for operational and strategic purposes. The existence of an
epidemiological system for georeferencing homicides is one of the factors identiﬁed in the
literature in all the notorious cases of homicide reduction.

Needless to say, our results are valid only under the hypotheses we assumed in the em-
pirical model. The main limitation is the possibility of endogeneity of PCC attacks. Those
attacks provoked a very strong response from law enforcement, which prompted the investi-
gation, imprisonment, and clamping down on the organization in the municipalities in which
the attacks occurred. Therefore, it is possible that the supposed PCC eﬀect was neutralized
by the eﬃcient action of public security institutions. In other words, even if a negative eﬀect
had been found, it would not be possible to tell if it reﬂects PCC inﬂuence on homicides or
the inﬂuence of police action in those municipalities after the attacks.

to construct the proxy for the presence and power of the PCC. By deﬁnition, there is an
attenuation bias because we assumed that this variable would be zero before the wave of
attacks carried out in 2006. The same was assumed for the binary variables (prisons, Infocrim,
etc.), because without temporal variability they could not enter the speciﬁcation in ﬁrst
diﬀerence. Nevertheless, the signiﬁcance of these binary variables – all of which have a
negative sign – indicates that the treatment that was applied at least did not deny the role
played by these variables in deﬁning the homicide rate. Unfortunately, we cannot say the
same for the PCC measure. On the one hand, if this criminal organization operated in the
municipality before the wave of attacks, the number of homicides could be smaller already
– according to the PCC hypothesis. This fact would justify the non-signiﬁcance of this
variable in the estimated models. On the other hand, in cases where a cell of the faction
already existed somewhere without the central command exerting its power and applying
the cartel rule yet (or if the structure of the drug market was competitive) and the regime
only became a cartel half way through the decade, then for practical purposes there is no
mitigation bias in its eﬀect on the homicide rate. If this is true, then what matters is not
whether this criminal organization operated in the municipality in the past or not, but rather
whether the market regime changed. Future studies should try to answer this question.
