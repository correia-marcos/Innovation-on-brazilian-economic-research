Abstract

We study the bitcoin market in Brazil, a large emerging economy with an unregulated bitcoin market. First we test if the Law
of One Price (LOOP) is valid for bitcoin prices in Brazil, conducting tests with data from three Brazilian exchanges. We ﬁnd a
common trend within bitcoin prices among these exchanges, with cointegration tests between the price series indicating that LOOP
is valid in Brazilian markets in the long run. Next, we document bitcoin price dynamics in the short run by studying the price
discovery mechanism in these exchanges. We use Information Share and Component Share, combining the two measures to obtain
an Information Leadership Share (ILS) measure. ILS indicates that, for closing prices, the most liquid exchange (Foxbit) leads
discovery, while the least liquid (Local Bitcoin) lags, with Mercado Bitcoin in the middle both in terms of discovery and liquidity.
Our research brings the ﬁrst evidence of a price discovery mechanism for exchanges in Brazilian Reais. Although LOOP is valid in
the long run, existing ineﬃciencies in bitcoin markets potentially create arbitrage opportunities in the short run.

Resumo

Estudamos o mercado de bitcoins no Brasil, uma grande economia emergente com um mercado de bitcoins não regulamentado.
Primeiro, testamos se a Lei do Preço Único (LOOP) é válida para os preços do bitcoin no Brasil, realizando testes com dados de três
bolsas brasileiras. Encontramos uma tendência comum nos preços de bitcoin entre essas bolsas, com os testes de cointegração entre
a série de preços indicando que o LOOP é válido nos mercados brasileiros no longo prazo. Em seguida, documentamos a dinâmica
dos preços do bitcoin no curto prazo, estudando o mecanismo de descoberta de preços nessas bolsas. Usamos Information Share
e Component Share, combinando as duas medidas para obter uma medida de Information Leadership Share (ILS). O ILS indica
que, para os preços de fechamento, a bolsa mais líquida (Foxbit) lidera a descoberta, enquanto a menos líquida (Local Bitcoin) ﬁca
atrás, com o Mercado Bitcoin no meio, tanto em termos de descoberta quanto de liquidez. Nossa pesquisa traz a primeira evidência
de um mecanismo de descoberta de preços para as trocas em reais. Embora o LOOP seja válido no longo prazo, as ineﬁciências
existentes nos mercados de bitcoin criam potencialmente oportunidades de arbitragem no curto prazo.

1 Introduction

Digital currency was an technology put in practice in the 1990s in the form of stored value cards
for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments that did not require bank authorization. Bitcoin is an online
communication protocol based on cryptography and information technology to facilitate P2P
transactions. Despite some similarities with traditional digital payment methods (e.g. medium
of exchange and store of value), two characteristics make it distinct: transactions can be made
anonymously and decentralized (Nguyen et al., 2018). Kristoufek (2015) has pointed out some
bitcoin advantages, such as low or no fees, a controlled and known algorithm for currency
creation, and an informational transparency for all transactions. On the other hand, bitcoin
suﬀers from some shortfalls such as the scalability problem and high energy consumption from
mining (Karame, 2016; Poon and Dryja, 2016; Narayanan et al., 2016).1 However, the factor
that attracts more attention both to media and investors is bitcoin price (Nguyen et al., 2018).
The ﬁrst study to address bitcoin price formation was conducted by Ciaian et al. (2016), who
considered both the traditional determinants of currency price – supply and demand forces –
and digital currency speciﬁc factor for investor’s attractiveness.

Investors around the globe have witnessed an impressive growth in cryptocurrencies
markets. Focusing on bitcoin, the ﬁrst ever cryptocurrency and the most well-known in the
market (Nguyen et al., 2018) displays a market cap surpassing US$ 100 billion. Although
the magnitude of the volume arouses the curiosity of many scholars, bitcoin’s price volatility
is quite peculiar.
It went from zero value at the time of its inception, in 2009, to around
$1100 4 years later. Then, the price dropped to around $250 at the end of 2014, before
another exponential growth curve until almost reaching $20.000 in December, 2017. Such price
movements are unusual for traditional currencies, suggesting that the determinants for price
formation do not follow rules established in previous theories (Ciaian et al., 2016), or in the
words of Mai et al. (2018) traditional explanatory variables for currency valuation fall short.
We approach the problem by studying the bitcoin market in Brazil, a large emerging economy
with an unregulated bitcoin market.

If information ﬂows freely, we should observe an equilibrium in price among exchanges,
independently of the geographical location. Under some market eﬃciency, bitcoin prices should
follow the Law of One Price (LOOP, hereafter). However, Pieters and Vivanco (2017) ﬁnd
evidence indicating violations of LOOP for bitcoin. After analyzing 11 distinct markets, rep-
resenting 26% of the global market, evidence indicates that LOOP is not veriﬁed in markets
where no compliance policy, such as mandatory user identiﬁcation, is in place. This is the case
we study, since in Brazil bitcoin exchanges are not subject to any regulation (BCB, 2017).

The study of ﬁnancial markets has brought evidence that emerging economies have
diﬀerent markets from developed economies. In particular, Bekaert and Harvey (2002) review
the empirical evidence and argue that emerging markets are relatively ineﬃcient due to slow
adjustment to new information. In addition, Cole et al. (2011) presents some evidence that
high ﬁxed costs of ﬁnancial services can be a barrier to ﬁnancial development. The market of
cryptocurrencies has the potential to overcome such costs, since to operate in these markets
one only needs access to the internet. Moreover, there is evidence that bitcoin markets can
be eﬃcient (Tiwari et al., 2018). Therefore, testing LOOP in the Brazilian bitcoin market can
shed light on our knowledge about ﬁnancial markets in emerging economies, and also on the
behavior of bitcoin markets per se. Brazil is a particularly interesting case, as according to

1Bitcoin mining is the process of conﬁrming transaction by writing then in a block to be added to the

Blockchain. For more details on Bitcoin mining see Narayanan et al. (2016).

Bitcoin Average (https://bitcoinaverage.com) the Brazilian bitcoin market was ranked 4th
in the world in 2017.

Following the method of Pieters and Vivanco (2017), we conduct tests using data from
three Brazilian exchanges to check whether bitcoin prices satisfy LOOP, even though no user
identiﬁcation rule is imposed through regulation, and some Brazilian bitcoin exchanges do not
mandate it. We ﬁnd a common trend within bitcoin prices among these diﬀerent exchanges.
First, we identify that prices are non-stationary in Brazilian markets. Next, we verify that
the price series are cointegrated. The cointegration tests between the price series indicate that
LOOP is valid in Brazilian markets in the long run.

However, there remains the question about bitcoin price dynamics in the short run.
Mai et al. (2018) raise a relevant concern about bitcoin price formation: what determines its
value? The answer concerns investors, who can proﬁt from estimating future price swings
and calculating expected returns. Bitcoin can be converted virtually to any ﬁat currency,
such as USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, or BRL. With exchanges all over the globe operating 24/7,
with little to no regulation, can there be opportunities of arbitrage? Such opportunities could
arise between countries, and between exchanges within the same country. Therefore, we also
study the price discovery mechanism in Brazilian exchanges. Price discovery happens when
new information is impounded into the implicit, eﬃcient price, leading to a permanent change
of its level (Hasbrouck, 1995). In the short run, one exchange could lead the other is price
discovery, opening up opportunities for arbitrage between Brazilian exchanges. We use two
distinct and complementary measures for price discovery (Baillie et al., 2002), Information
Share (Hasbrouck, 1995), and Component Share (Gonzalo and Granger, 1995). We combine
the two measures to obtain an Information Leadership Share (ILS) measure (Putnin, š, 2013).
ILS indicates that, for closing prices, the most liquid exchange (Foxbit) leads discovery, while
the least liquid (Local Bitcoin) lags, with Mercado Bitcoin in the middle both in terms of
discovery and liquidity.

To the best of our knowledge, our research brings the ﬁrst evidence of a price discovery
mechanism for exchanges in Brazilian Reais. The evidence we bring show that LOOP is valid
in the long run, but reinforces existing evidence that ineﬃciencies in bitcoin markets still exist,
potentially creating arbitrage opportunities (Köchling et al., 2018; Sensoy, 2018). We contribute
to the growing literature of bitcoin prices with novel evidence from a large emerging economy.
The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data
and presents some characteristics of Brazilian Bitcoin exchanges. Section 3 presents the test
we use in order to identify LOOP and price discovery of Bitcoin price. Section 4 discusses and
evaluates the empirical results. Finally, section 5 presents our ﬁnal remarks.

2 Data

We use daily bitcoin price data spanning from December 11th, 2014 to October 17th, 2017,
yielding 1013 days. The initial date corresponds to the beginning of Foxbit exchange’s price
series. The end date is the last day available for all exchanges on the date of data collection. We
use Quandl’s API to retrieve the prices. Quandl is a platform that collects several economics
and ﬁnance time series, collecting bitcoin prices reported to Bitcoincharts.

The data we obtain come from 3 Brazilian exchanges: Local Bitcoin, Mercado Bitcoin,
and Foxbit (see Table 1). Although there are other exchanges in Brazil, like NegocieCoins,

3

Arena Bitcoin, and Bitcointoyou, we do not have access to their data. They do not report daily
prices to Bitcoincharts, a platform that aggregates bitcoin data from all over the world, nor
provide any means of getting daily prices directly from them.

All exchanges have daily prices from December 11th, 2014 to October 17th, 2017.

Of the 3 exchanges, Mercado Bitcoin does not clearly state whether it adopts some kind
of know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money-laundering (AML) policy. These are important
features for the validity of the Law of One Price (LOOP) (Pieters and Vivanco, 2017). In turn,
both Local Bitcoin and Foxbit report to comply with KYC and AML policies. Table 2 presents
the main characteristics of these exchanges regarding customer policies.

Table 3 shows the averages for the data Quandl provides. There are opening and closing
prices, highest and lowest intraday prices, and transaction volume. Unlike stock exchanges,
bitcoin exchanges do not really have opening and closing times, since they operate 24h per day,
7 days a week, non-stop. Therefore, closing price is the last trade recorded until 23h59min59sec
UTC, and the opening price is the ﬁrst negotiation recorded from 0h00min00sec, UTC (Coor-
dinated Universal Time).

Note how average prices diﬀer from one exchange to another. In particular, the High and
Low prices of Local Bitcoin present a sizable diﬀerence when compared to the other exchanges.
It may be a liquidity problem, as the average traded volume is much lower in Local Bitcoin.
However, the other two exchanges also show signs of diﬀerent prices, although to a smaller
degree. Also note that Open and Close prices are potentially less than 1 second away from
each other, and even so there are non-negligible diﬀerences within the same exchange.
In
conjunction, these numbers indicate a highly dynamic and volatile market, in which pricing
can quickly change.

Figure 1 plots the opening price series for each of the exchanges. Their overall shapes
are quite similar, with little visual diﬀerences. All of the series start at about R$1,000, and
ﬂuctuate around this value until May/2017. On this month prices begin escalating, and reached
about R$18,000 in October 17th, 2017, in all exchanges. One diﬀerence worth noting is the
larger volatility of Local Bitcoin, corroborating the analysis of Table 3. The graphs also show
similar trends and behaviors: the series apparently are non-stationary, and seem to display

comovement, indicating that these series may have a unit root and be cointegrated. Next we
discuss how we formally test these properties.

3 Methodology

3.1 LOOP

We use only the opening and closing prices series. The high and low prices can occur at
diﬀerent times of the day on each exchange, thus defeating the purpose of our study, since
prices at diﬀerent times can be related to diﬀerent information sets. This rationale is especially
true for bitcoin, since the cryptocurrency is traded continuously around the globe.

We use three distinct unit root tests. One of them uses the opposite null hypothesis
of the others, thus increasing the power of our tests and reducing concerns of wrong inference
(Kwiatkowski et al., 1992). The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) test
the null hypothesis of a unit root (Dickey and Fuller, 1979; Phillips and Perron, 1988). The
Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests the null of stationarity (Kwiatkowski et al.,
1992).

If the tests detect the existence of a unit root, the series can be tested for cointegration
(Johansen, 1995). The test checks the existence of cointegration vectors, and indicates whether
the series move in tandem in the long run. The cointegration test is applied to each pair of price
series. We ﬁxate the type of price (opening or closing) and then compare the same series across
exchanges. The test can be generalized to several series at the same time, but our question is
about the LOOP and the pair by pair test suﬃces. To select the number of lags of the Johansen
procedure we use the AIC (Akaike information Criterion) (Johansen, 1995).

The cointegration tests if a linear combination between two price series from diﬀerent
exchanges, x1 and x2, is able to form a third, stationary series. Consider Equation 1. P y
is
the bitcoin price in period t, exchange y. β is a parameter, and εt is the linear combination of
prices. Formally, the cointegration test checks if a β exists so that ε is stationary. If such β
exists and is close to 1, it is evidence that LOOP is valid for prices from x1 and x2.

3.1.1 Price discovery

Returning to Equation 1, suppose that β = 1 and therefore LOOP is valid. Since cointegration
is a long run relation, we can have a disturbance at the price among diﬀerent markets in the

5

short run. Moreover, cointegration implies causality between the prices at least in one direction.
Then, one of the markets can lead price changes in the Brazilian market. There remains the
question where price discovery occurs. Within the framework of Hasbrouck (1995), there is a
common, implicit eﬃcient price for the same asset traded in diﬀerent markets. Same asset is
deﬁned broadly as assets “closely linked by arbitrage or short-term equilibrium considerations”,
such as an asset traded in diﬀerent exchanges, or an asset and its derivative (Hasbrouck, 1995).
Price discovery happens when new information is impounded into the eﬃcient price,
leading to a permanent change in its level (Hasbrouck, 1995; Harris et al., 2002; Aggarwal
and Thomas, 2018). One way of measuring it is through Information Share (IS), “deﬁned as
the proportion of the eﬃcient price innovation variance that can be attributed” to one market
(Hasbrouck, 1995). Implementation details can be found in Hasbrouck (1995) and Aggarwal.
We use it to test which exchange dictates price discovery by doing all permutations possible to
estimate the upper and lower bounds of IS for each market.

Another way of measuring price discovery is through Component Share (CS). The mea-
sure is based on Gonzalo and Granger (1995)’s approach of obtaining common factors that are
integrated of order 1. As Baillie et al. (2002) argue, CS complements IS, providing a diﬀerent
view of the price discovery process. Both models are based on VECMs (Vector Error Correc-
tion Models). However, the IS model works with variance, while the CS model is based on the
contribution given by the market’s error correction coeﬃcients to the common factor (Baillie
et al., 2002; Harris et al., 2002). One important feature of CS is that it “isolates the dynamics
following a synchronous event of price divergence (...) and the subsequent readjustment to a
common stochastic trend” (Harris et al., 2002).

Baillie et al. (2002) exemplify this isolation property of CS. Consider an asset traded
in two diﬀerent markets, with highly correlated and cointegrated prices. The ﬁrst market’s
price responds to deviations from the second market’s price, but the opposite is not true: the
second market’s price does not respond to the ﬁrst. According to the CS model, price discovery
happens on the second market. However, the IS model suggests the two markets contribute to
price discovery, since they are highly correlated.

Yan and Zivot (2010) discuss what IS and CS really measure. One result is that IS can
yield ambiguous interpretations, as Baillie et al. (2002) discuss. However, Yan and Zivot (2010)
also show that CS “measures the relative response to contemporaneous transitory frictions”,
concluding that CS does not measure responses to new information but the level of noise in one
price series relative to the other (Putnin, š, 2013). To overcome these issues, we follow Putnin, š
(2013) and calculate the Information Leadership Share (ILS), deﬁned as in Equation 3.

In which ILk, ISk, and CSk are market’s k Information Leadership metric, Information
Share, and Component Share, respectively. As ISk depends on the ordering of the price series,
we also follow Baillie et al. (2002) and use the simple average between IS and Reverse IS as
ISk. Note that ILk ∈ [0,∞), unlike ISk and CSk, which lie in the interval [0, 1]. Therefore,
we normalize to an Information Leadership Share (ILSk).

4 Results

Table 4 presents results for the unit root test. They indicate both opening and closing price
series are non-stationary. The only exception is the PP test for the Local Bitcoin exchange
closing price series. Therefore, we consider that prices exhibit non-stationarity in all exchanges.

We also test whether the ﬁrst diﬀerence series has a unit root (Table 5). Note how all
series are stationary in all tests. In conjunction with Table 4, we conclude that all the bitcoin
price series we use are integrated of order 1, I(1). Therefore, we can proceed to test their
cointegration (Johansen, 1995).

Table 6 shows the cointegration test. Note that we test the three exchanges in pairs,
yielding C(3, 2) = 3 test statistics. The test for Rank = 0 rejects the null of no cointegration,
while the test for Rank = 1 does not reject the null that the pair is cointegrated, both for the
closing and opening prices. Therefore, we conclude all pairs of series are cointegrated.

More important, closing price series, as well as the opening price series, share one com-
mon trend and consequently, move in tandem in the long term. Note that the cointegration
test between Mercado Bitcoin and Local Bitcoin prices is not necessary, since they both share
a trend wit Foxbit (Stock and Watson, 1988). However, we conduct the test anyway, since our
question is not about cointegration only. We also want details on the cointegration vectors, to
recover the estimated β from Equation 1, shown in Table 7. The evidence indicates that the
Law of One Price is valid between these three Brazilian bitcoin exchanges, since all of the ˆβs
are close to 1. Therefore, in the long term prices converge to the same value between these
exchanges. However, this may not be true in the short term, which we explore next.

price variables (Aggarwal; Baillie et al., 2002), Table 8 also shows the Reverse IS. The IS value
we use to calculate the ILS advocated by Putnin, š (2013) is the simple mean between IS and
Reverse IS.

The Mean IS estimate indicates that Mercado Bitcoin (MB) leads price discovery. Or-
dering the inequalities, we obtain that MB leads, Foxbit (FB) stands in the middle, and Local
Bitcoin (LB) lags discovery. CS tells a similar story, with Mercado Bitcoin leading discovery
in Brazil. This is consistent with LB being by far the less liquid exchange, with a volume less
than a tenth of MB or FB (see Table 3). The diﬀerence between FB and MB is much lower,
with FB trading 1.5 times the volume of MB. However, in this case, the less liquid exchange
leads price discovery.

Results taking into account for IS and CS simultaneously through ILS tell us a diﬀerent
story. For the closing prices, the ordering is inconsistent. ILS implies LB both leads and lags
the other exchanges. Opening prices tell a more consistent story, although diﬀerent from IS and
CS. Both FB and MB lead LB, consistent with IS and CS. But here FB leads MB, resulting
in FB – MB – LB ordering of price discovery. Thus, ILS estimates for closing prices follow
the ordering of liquidity with the most liquid exchange leading and the least liquid lagging
discovery.

The disagreement between the isolated measures, IS and CS, and the integrated measure,
ILS, is consistent with Putnin, š (2013) and Yan and Zivot (2010) suggestions that IS can be
ambiguous, and CS measures level of noise. For the opening prices, there is a correlation
between liquidity and price discovery as measured by ILS. It indicates that arbitrageurs might
use Foxbit’s price to generate opportunities. However, as the LOOP test indicates, these
opportunities disappear over time.

Our ﬁndings go in line with Brandvold et al. (2015), who document that certain ex-
changes lead others in price discovery, but they only include exchanges denominated in US
Dollars, Chinese Yuans, Polish Złotys, and Canadian Dollars. To the best of our knowledge,
our result is the ﬁrst to point a price discovery mechanism for exchanges denominated in Brazil-

IS is Information Share (Hasbrouck, 1995). Reverse IS the same as IS, but reversing the
price order (Aggarwal; Baillie et al., 2002). Mean IS is the arithmetic mean between
IS and Reverse IS (Baillie et al., 2002). CS is Component Share (Baillie et al., 2002;
Harris et al., 2002; Gonzalo and Granger, 1995). ILS is Information Leadership share,
calculated as in Equation 3 aggregating both IS and CS measures (Yan and Zivot, 2010;
Putnin, š, 2013). A larger ILS indicates that the series leads price discovery, as indicated
by numbers in bold.

ian Reais. Our result is also consistent with Makarov and Schoar (2018), who ﬁnd that arbitrage
opportunities can persist for days or even weeks in the US, Japan, and Korea. We document
that the same opportunities may exist in the Brazilian market, reinforcing evidence that the
bitcoin market still has ineﬃciencies, although it has been improving (Köchling et al., 2019;
Sensoy, 2018).

5 Final Remarks

This research adds to the growing literature on bitcoin (Halaburda and Sarvary, 2016). We con-
tribute to the knowledge of bitcoin price behavior in a large emerging market, Brazil. Bitcoin
evidence in non-developed markets is relatively scarce, despite the importance of such markets
(Carrick, 2016; Ferreira Frascaroli and Carvalho Pinto, 2016). To the best of our knowledge,
our research brings the ﬁrst evidence of a price discovery mechanism for exchanges in Brazil-
ian Reais. The evidence we bring show that LOOP is valid in the long run, but reinforces
existing evidence that ineﬃciencies in bitcoin markets still exist, potentially creating arbitrage
opportunities (Köchling et al., 2018; Sensoy, 2018).
