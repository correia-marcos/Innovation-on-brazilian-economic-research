Resumo 

 
A partir de uma base de dados de 121 bancos brasileiros no período de março de 2001 
até junho de 2015 foi analisado o efeito das taxas de juros da política monetária sobre o 
comportamento  dos  instrumentos  macroprudenciais.  Os  resultados  indicam  que  um 
aumento  da  taxa  de  juros  da  política  monetária  leva  os  bancos  a  aumentar  o  buffer  de 
capital,  as  provisões  de  crédito  e  a  alavancagem  bancária 
(instrumentos 
macroprudenciais). Por outro lado, quando há queda das taxas de juros os instrumentos 
macroprudenciais  são  reduzidos,  o  que  implica  em  um  maior  risco  para  a  estabilidade 
financeira.  Este  resultado  sugere  a  necessidade  da  coordenação  entre  a  utilização  dos 
instrumentos  macroprudenciais  e  a  política  monetária,  principalmente  durante  os 
períodos de baixas taxa de juros.

1. Introduction 

 

In  general,  central  banks  have  two  objectives:  price  stability  and  financial 
stability. One consequence of the subprime crisis for central bank’s management is the 
need to use macroprudential instruments to safeguard the financial system. Nowadays, 
an  important  issue  for  policymakers  is  to  identify  the  effects  that  exist  between 
monetary policy and macroprudential policy (Cecchetti, 2016). A challenge for central 
banks is to see how the conduct of the monetary policy can affect the macroprudential 
instruments  that  are  being  used  to  ensure  the  stability  of  the  financial  system  (Poloz, 
2015; and Smets, 2014). 

In  order  to  ensure  financial  stability,  macroprudential  policy  must  be  used  to 
avoid  or  minimize  the  procyclicality  of  banks’  behavior  (Claessens,  2015).  The 
macroprudential  instrument  that  has  gained  most  attention  from  policymakers  is  the 
countercyclical capital buffer – CCyB (BCBS, 2010; Drehmann, Borio, and Tsatsaronis, 
2011). The aim of the use of CCyB is to ensure that commercial banks raise the buffer 
when  the  economy  is  expanding  in  order  to  be  used  to  absorb  bank  losses  in  times  of 
downturn.  In  addition  to  CCyB,  the  countercyclical  use  of  credit  provisions  (dynamic 
provisions) and the limits on leverage has been considered by policymakers as a toolkit 
of financial institutions-based policies (Cerutti, Claessens, Laeven, 2017).  

This study is a contribution to the literature that analyzes the effect of monetary 
policy interest rate on the use of macroprudential financial institutions-based policies. In 
order to evaluate this phenomenon it is necessary to consider an economic environment 
that  combines  a  developed  financial  system  and  that  the  central  bank  has  the  interest 
rate as its main instrument of monetary policy. In this context, Brazil has characteristics 
that  fit  in  this  profile  and  thus  allows  an  investigation  that  can  be  useful  for  other 
economies. The Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) has two mandates: financial stability and 
price stability. In order to maintain financial stability, the CBB supervises the operation 
of  all  banks  (Brazilian  banks’  assets  correspond  to  180%  of  GDP  -  IMF,  2012). 
Regarding  the  search  for  price  stability,  the  CBB  adopts  inflation  targeting  since  June 
1999 and has the Selic rate (monetary policy interest rate) as its main instrument. 

The  CBB  analyzes  economic-financial  data  provided  by  commercial  banks  to 
supervise  the  banks.  Based  on  this  information,  the  CBB  discloses,  every  quarter,  the 
“economic-financial analysis” report. Hence, such reports represent an essential source 
of information for micro and macroprudential analysis. An original database (total 7,000 
observations  taking  into  account  121  banks)  was  built  by  analyzing  the  content  of  the 
reports  for  the  period  from  March  2001  to  June  2015.  This  database  extracted  from 
banks  (micro-level  data)  allows  us  to  evaluate  how  changes  in  the  CBB’s  monetary 
policy interest rate affect macroprudential financial institutions-based policies. For this 
purpose,  several  panel  data  models  are  used  which  consider  monetary  policy  interest 
rate  and  specific  instruments  for  macroprudential  financial  institutions-based  policies 
(capital buffer, credit provisions, and leverage). 

The findings denote that an increase in the monetary policy interest rate implies 
an  adjustment  in  the  banks’  strategy  for  ensuring  the  safety  and  soundness,  which,  in 
turn, amplifies the use macroprudential financial institutions-based policies. In contrast, 
when  the  central  bank  reduces  the  interest  rate,  banks  reduce  the  use  of  this  kind  of 
macroprudential tools and thereby decrease the safety of the financial system.

Besides this introduction, this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents 
 
the data and variables, as well as the models and methods used in this study. Section 3 
shows  evidence  regarding  the  effect  of  the  monetary  policy  interest  rate  on  the 
macroprudential financial institutions-based policies. Section 4 presents the conclusion. 
 

2. Data and methodology 

 

The effect of monetary policy on the financial system is through the banks’ risk-
taking  channel.  The  risk-taking  channel  refers  to  how  changes  in  monetary  policy 
interest  rates  affect  the  banks’  risk  perceptions  (Borio  and  Zhu,  2012).  Nowadays,  in 
addition  to  the  risk-taking  channel,  policymakers  are  concerned  with  investigating 
whether  monetary  policy  can  affect  financial  stability  (Poloz,  2015,  Smets,  2014). 
Assuming that macroprudential instruments are useful to maintain the financial stability, 
this study is a contribution to understand this relashionship.  

In  order  to  consider  the  impact  of  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy  on 
macroprudential instruments, panel data models are used. The sample consists of 7,000 
observations extracted from the balance sheets of 121 banks for the period from March 
2001  to  June  2015  (58  quarters).  Such  information  is  made  available  from  the  CBB 
through the IF.data system (Selected Information on Supervised Institutions). In order to 
carry  out  this  study,  three  instruments  for  macroprudential  financial  institutions-based 
policies are considered: capital buffer, credit provisions, and bank leverage. 

The  capital  buffer  (BUF)  represents  the  volume  of  capital  higher  than  the 
minimum  regulatory  requirement  held  by  the  banks.  The  buffer  is  measured  by  the 
difference between the capital of financial institutions and the minimum capital required 
by  the  regulators  (CAR).  Therefore,  the  larger  the  buffer,  the  lower  the  risk  of 
bankruptcy.  On  the  other  hand,  in  relation  to  the  economic  cycle,  banks  maintain  the 
buffer on a procyclical path, that is, reduce the buffer in times of economic growth and 
increase in times of depression (Stolz and Wedow, 2011). In other words, they amplify 
the cycle and thus increase the risk of events of financial instability.  

Credit provisions (PROV) represent the coverage that banks maintain to support 
probable  credit  losses.  Provisions  are  measured  by  the  ratio  of  the  coverage  for  credit 
losses provided by the banks to the total credit volume. It is important to highlight that 
credit  provisions  held  by  banks  have  a  forward-looking  characteristic  because  they 
behave  according  to  banks’  expectations  in  relation  to  the  future  business  cycle  (de 
Moraes, Montes and Antunes, 2016; Jiménez and Saurina, 2006). Such as observed for 
the  case  of  the  capital  buffer,  the  procyclical  behavior  regarding  credit  provisions  can 
represent a threat for the financial stability.  

Bank’s  leverage  (LEV)  represents  capital  to  assets  ratio.  Therefore,  it  is 
calculated  by  the  ratio  between  the  capital  and  the  total  assets  held  by  the  banks. 
Therefore, the higher the LEV the lower the leverage. The behavior of bank’s leverage is 
procyclical, that is, leverage increases in times of economic boom and reduces in times 
of economic downturn (Adrian and Shin, 2009). As a result of the subprime crisis, the 
Basel Committee suggested that central banks should monitor and limit bank’s leverage 
in order to reduce their procyclical component (BCBS, 2014). 

Taking into account the annual average of the financial institutions used in this 
study, figure 1 shows the path of macroprudential instruments between 2002 and 2014.

In  relation  to  the  capital  buffer,  the  increase  in  2003-2004  represents  a  period  of 
adaptation due to the regulatory changes from Basel II Accord. In the following years, a 
retreat  in  the  capital  buffer  is  observed.  However,  due  to  the  advent  of  the  subprime 
crisis  there  was  a  new  increase  in  the  use  of  this  tool  and  only  after  2009  was  a 
reduction  observed.  Regarding  credit  provisions,  there  was  relative  stability  until  the 
subprime  crisis,  when  there  was  an  increase  followed  by  a  return  to  the  pattern  of  the 
previous  years.  Similar  movement  to  credit  provisions  is  also  observed  for  bank’s 
leverage.  In  brief,  the  paths  of  macroprudential  instruments  show  that  there  exists  a 
similar reaction (increase) to the subprime crisis.

The  monetary  policy  interest  rate  in  Brazil  is  the  Selic  interest  rate  (IR),  the 
interest rate for overnight interbank loans collateralized by government bonds registered 
with and traded on the Sistema Especial de Liquidação e Custódia. The monetary policy 
interest  rate  target  is  fixed  for  the  period  between  meetings  of  the  Committee  of 
Monetary Policy (COPOM) with the objective to achieve the inflation target. 

The  behavior  of  macroprudential  instruments  (BUF,  PROV,  and  LEV)  with  the 
 
monetary  policy  interest  rate  can  be  observed  in  figures  2  to  4.  In  general,  the  capital 
buffer,  the  credit  provisions,  and  bank’s  leverage  overreacted  in  two  moments.  A  first 
moment  was  in  2003  due  to  the  confidence  crisis  caused  by  the  election  of  President 
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva who promised to change the macroeconomic policy in Brazil. 
A second moment was in 2008 because of the subprime crisis, which in turn affected the 
behavior  of  banks  around  the  world.  These  moments  show  a  clear  opposite  path 
between  the  monetary  policy  interest  rate  and  the  macroprudential  instruments. 
However, most of the time, it is possible to see the monetary policy interest rate and the 
macroprudential instruments following a similar path.

In order to  mitigate  omitted variable biases we  consider well-accepted variables 
present  in  the  literature  on  the  determination  of  capital  buffer,  credit  provisions  and 
leverage.  As  most  studies  taken  into  consideration,  the  effect  from  liquidity,  equity  or 
regulatory  capital,  and  performance  in  the  analysis  (see  Stolz  and  Wedow,  2011; 
Gambacorta and Mistrulli, 2004; Dahl, 2012; and Tabak et al., 2013), we included the 
following variables in the empirical model: banking liquidity (LIQ) - liquid assets/total 
assets  ratio,  rate  of  change  in  credit  (CRED),  return  on  equity  (ROE)  –  net  income 
returned as a percentage of shareholders equity, non-performing loans (NPL) measured 
by  the  ratio  transactions  between  credit  operations  with  arrears  over  90  days  and  total 
credit  portfolio.  All  data  is  gathered  from  Central  Bank  of  Brazil  with  quarterly 
frequency. 

Based  on  the  variables  described  above  and  taking  into  account  the  aim  of 
investigating  the  impact  of  the  monetary  policy  interest  rate  on  the  macroprudential 
instruments, our general specification is as follows:1

where the subscript i=1,2,…,121 is the bank; t=1,2,…,58 is the time period, and ε is the 
disturbance.  MT  is  the  macroprudential  instruments  denoted  by  the  three  alternative 
variables:  capital  buffer  (BUF),  credit  provisions  (PROV),  and  bank’s  leverage  (LEV). 
IR  is  the  interest  rate  of  monetary  policy,  and  Z  covers  mostly  the  bank’s  individual 
characteristics (LIQ, CRED, ROE, and NPL). 

 

Apart from the variables mentioned above, other control variables  are included

banks, and the subprime crisis on the macroprudential instruments. In this context, the 
output gap (GAP), measured as result of the difference between GDP and the potential 
output  (Hodrick-Prescott  filter),  is  introduced  in  order  to  observe  the  effects  from  the 
business cycle. In the same vein, the size of banks (SIZE) measured by the log of total 
banks’ assets is also included in the analysis. At last, in order to consider the effect from 
the  subprime  crisis,  a  dummy  variable  (CRISIS)  equal  to  one  for  the  period  from  the 
second quarter 2008 to second quarter 2009 (period which CBB reduced the interest rate 
in response to the crisis) and zero otherwise is introduced in the model. 

 
Such as Guidara et.al (2013), and Stolz and Wedow (2011) this study makes use 
of dynamic panel data framework through System Generalized Method of Moments (S-
GMM). According to Arellano and Bond (1991), the use of dynamic panel data method 
(GMM)  is  able  to  eliminate  non-observed  effects  on  the  regressions  and  the  estimates 
are  reliable  even  in  the  presence  of  omitted  variables.  The  use  of  instruments  permits 
the  estimation  of  parameters  more  consistently,  even  in  the  case  of  endogeneity  in 
explanatory  variables  and  in  the  presence  of  measurement  errors  (Bond,  Hoeffler,  and 
Temple, 2001).  

The empirical  model developed in  this study is  subject  to  the above-mentioned 
 
problems.  In  short,  not  all  explanatory  variables  of  the  model  are  known  and 
measurable. In addition, the presence of reverse causality is possible, for example, in the 
relation  between  capital  buffer  and  liquidity  as  well  as  in  the  relation  between  credit 
provisions 
the 
endogeneity/simultaneity  problem,  it  is  possible  that  credit  provisions  affect  non-
performing loans.

As  a  way  of  mitigating  the  fact  that,  for  example,  first-difference  GMM  has  a 
 
bias (for large and small samples), low accuracy, and the use of lags can generate weak 
instruments,  Arellano  and  Bover  (1995)  and  Blundell  and  Bond  (1998)  suggest  the 
introduction of moment  conditions. Therefore, S-GMM combines regression equations 
in  differences  and  in  levels  into  one  system  and  makes  use  of  lagged  differences  and 
lagged levels as instruments. 

 
Although  S-GMM  estimation  approach  is  suitable  for  a  small  number  of  time 
periods (t) and a large number of cross-sections (i), in the case of small samples, when 
the instruments are too many, they tend to over-fit the instrumented variables generating 
a bias in the outcomes (Roodman, 2009). Hence, with the intention of avoiding the use 
of  an  excessive  number  of  instruments  in  the  regressions,  and  thus  lose  the  power  of 
tests,  the  number  of  instruments/number  of  cross-sections  ratio  considered  in  each 
regression  is  less  than  1  (de  Mendonça  and  Barcelos,  2015).  Furthermore,  in  order  to 
observe  the  validity  of  the  instruments  in  the  models,  the  test  of  over-identifying 
restrictions  (J-test)  is  performed  as  suggested  by  Arellano  (2003).  Moreover,  tests  of 
first-order (AR1) and second-order (AR2) serial correlation are also performed. 

 
Taking  into  account  the  baseline  model,  we  extend  our  analysis  providing  new 
empirical  evidence  regarding  the  effect  of  the  monetary  policy  interest  rate  on  the 
macroprudential instruments through a Panel Structural Vector Autoregressive approach 
(panel S-VAR).

Although,  a  VAR  model  allows  one  to  see  how  each  variable  in  the  model 
responds to itself and others, the focus of this analysis in on how an impulse transmitted 
by  monetary  policy  interest  rate  affects  the  macroprudential  instruments  over  time.  In 
general,  the  dynamic  analysis  of  VAR  is  made  through  impulse  response  functions. 
Thus graphs which show the response of BUF, PROV, and LEV to IR with a horizon of 
five  years  (twenty  quarters)  are  presented.  The  errors  are  orthogonalized  by  Cholesky 
decomposition, which in turn implies that the ordination of the variables in the model is 
important for impulse-response analysis (see Enders, 2015). Following the presentation 
of the variables in equation 1 and based on Akaike (AIC), Schwarz (SIC), and Hannan-
Quinn (HQ) criteria, the VAR order is defined (see table A.2 - appendix).2 Furthermore, 
it is noteworthy to highlight that all roots in models have modulus less than one and lie 
inside the unit circle and thus impulse response and standard errors are valid (see table 
A.4 – appendix). 
 
3. Estimation results 

 

With  the  objective  of  observing  the  relation  between  the  variables  used  in  the 
models  regarding  monetary  policy  interest  rate  and  macroprudential  instruments,  the 
correlation matrix is presented in table A.5 (see appendix). In particular, we can observe 
that  the  positive  correlation  between  IR  and  BUF,  PROV,  and  LEV  (macroprudential 
instruments)  suggests  that  a  restrictive  monetary  policy  induces  banks  to  increase  the 
security of the financial system. On the other hand, a reduction in the interest rate may 
lead banks to  reduce  capital  buffer, credit provisions and  to  increase leverage, thereby 
reducing the protection of the financial system. 

 
The estimation results for capital buffer, credit provisions, and bank’s leverage, 
all  of  which  take  into  account  the  effect  from  the  monetary  policy  interest  rate,  are 
reported in tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All regressions accept the null hypothesis in 
the  J-test  and  thus  the  over-identifying  restrictions  are  valid.  Furthermore,  both  serial 
autocorrelation  tests  (AR(1)  and  AR(2))  do  not  indicate  the  presence  of  serial 
autocorrelation. 

In  general,  the  results  from  all  models  (see  tables  1,  2  and  3)  reveal  statistical 
significance  for the  coefficients regarding monetary policy interest  rate.  Therefore,  we 
cannot  rule  out  the  effect  the  monetary  policy  interest  rate  has  on  macroprudential 
instruments (BUF, PROV and LEV). The sign of the coefficients denotes that the banks 
react  to  an  increase  in  the  interest  rates  with  the  amplification  of  the  macroprudential 
instruments. This result can be explained by an increase in bank’s risk aversion due to 
an  expected  worsening  of  the  economy’s  consequence  of  the  increase  in  the  interest 
rate. On the other hand, a reduction in the interest rate increases the bank’s risk appetite, 
which  in  turn  implies  a  reduction  of  macroprudential  instruments  and,  therefore,  a 
greater risk for the financial stability. 

In particular, the increase in the capital buffer due to an increase in the monetary 
policy  interest  rate  (see  table  1)  denotes  the  concern  of  the  banks  to  increase  their 
coverage  against  bank’s  solvency  risk  (increase  in  the  buffer).  On  the  other  hand,  a 
reduction  of  the  interest  rate  induces  banks  to  reduce  the  capital  buffer.  Hence,  this 
                                                           
2  In  order  to  check  presence  of  unit  root,  the  tests  Levin-Lin-Chu,  Im-Pesaran-Shin,  Fisher-ADF,  and 
Fisher-PP were performed (see table A.3 - appendix). The results do not indicate that the series are non-
stationary.

indicates that in a low interest rate environment there is a greater risk to lose financial 
stability. This result is in line with the results observed by Cecchetti and Kohler (2014). 

Regarding the effect of the monetary policy interest rate on credit provision (see 
table  2),  the  positive  sign  and  the  statistical  significance  observed  reveal  another 
connection between monetary and macroprudential policies. In this sense, in the case of 
an increase in the interest rate, banks tend to increase the coverage for credit loss. This 
result  is  equivalent  to  those  found  by  Altunbas,  Gambacorta,  and  Marqués-Ibáñez 
(2014).

In  the  same  way  as  observed  for  the  macroprudential  instruments  mentioned 
earlier,  the  result  of  the  estimation  of  the  models  presented  in  table  3  shows  that  the 
coefficient  on  the  monetary  policy  interest  rate  is  positive  and  significant.  In  other 
words,  this  result  indicates  that  banks  reduce  leverage  under  a  scenario  of  increasing 
interest  rates  and  increase  it  when  decreasing  interest  rates.  As  an  example  of  similar 
results, see Dell'Ariccia, Laeven, and Marquez (2013).

The  buffer,  credit  provision  and  leverage’s  reaction  to  monetary  policy  can  be 
explained  by  banks’  forward-looking  behavior.  When  there  is  an  increase  in  the 
monetary policy interest rate, banks expect a deterioration of the economy and thus they 
adopt  a  conservative  position  (intensify  the  protection  through  macroprudential 
instruments).  On  the  other  hand,  when  monetary  policy  interest  rate  decreases,  banks 
reduce  the  security  level  of  macroprudential  instruments.  The  intuition  behind  these 
results corresponding the idea that banks react taking less risk when monetary policy is 
tightened and more when it is eased, similar to Jimenez et al. (2014) for least capitalized 
banks.

In  relation  to  the  variables  that  represent  the  individual  characteristics  of  the 
banks  (variable  Z  -  equation  1),  the  results  are  in  agreement  with  those  observed  for 
most  of  the  literature  on  banks.  The  coefficients  on  liquidity  (LIQ)  are  positive  and 
significant  in  all  models,  which  makes  it  possible  to  infer  that  macroprudential 
instruments  (BUF,  PROV  and  LEV)  are  sensitive  to  liquidity  conditions.  The  more 
liquid the banks are, the less risk they assume. In relation to the coefficients related to 
the credit growth rate (CRED), it is observed that they are negative and significant. As 

 

10 

observed by Jokivuolle, Pesola, and Viren (2015), this result suggests that, for example, 
when there is a positive credit variation, capital buffer and leverage are reduced due to 
higher  bank  leverage  with  respect  to  credit.  Moreover,  as  observed  by  Foos,  Norden, 
and  Weber  (2010),  this  result  indicates  that  the  higher  the  provision  for  credit  risk 
(PROV),  the  lower  the  volume  of  credit  granted  to  the  economy  as  a  whole.  In 
consonance with de Mendonça and Barcelos (2015), the positive sign and the statistical 
significance observed for return on assets (ROE) in the models for capital buffer and for 
leverage denote the well-known relationship  between risk and return.  In  the model for 
credit  provision  the  statistical  significance  and  the  positive  sign  of  the  coefficients 
related to non-performing loans (NPL) reveal that the higher the default, the greater the 
coverage for credit risk.

As  extensions  to  the  basic  model,  new  estimates  are  made  taking  into  account  
economic  cycle  (GAP),  bank’s  size  (SIZE),  and  the  effect  from  the  subprime  crisis 
(models 2 to 4 - tables 2, 3 and 4). The statistical significance and the negative sign of 
GAP indicate that macroprudential instruments behave procyclically. On the one hand, 
when  there  is  economic  growth,  banks  reduce  the  soundness  of  the  financial  system 

 

11 

through  the  reduction  of  macroprudential  instruments.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the 
economic growth is lower than the potential, banks widen macroprudential instruments 
and  therefore  increase  the  soundness  of  the  financial  system.  In  brief,  countercyclical 
regulatory  actions  are  necessary  in  order  to  maintain  financial  stability  (BIS  2014, 
Murcia  and  Kohlscheen,  2016).  Statistical  significance  and  the  positive  sign  of  SIZE 
indicate  that  larger  banks  tend  to  maintain  larger  coverages  for  risks  assumed.  One 
possible explanation for this result is the fact that large banks have greater access to the 
market  (equity    and  debt  markets).  Finally,  the  statistical  significance  and  the  positive 
sign  related  to  the  subprime  crisis  dummy  indicate  that  banks  react  to  financial  crises 
with greater risk aversion (increase protection through macroprudential instruments). 

Extending the analysis regarding the impact of the monetary policy interest rate 
on  macroprudential  instruments,  impulse-response  functions  plotted  out  to  the  20th 
quarter from a S-VAR model (see equation 2) are presented. In general, the findings are 
in consonance with those observed in tables 2, 3 and 4. In other words, figure 5 shows 
that a positive shock transmitted through interest rate provokes an amplification of the 
macroprudential instruments which abides over time. 

Regarding  the  capital  buffer  and  leverage,  the  response  to  a  shock  transmitted 
through  monetary  policy  interest  rate  (first  and  third  graphs  in  figure  5)  denotes  that 
there is statistical significance for an increase in the capital buffer and leverage from 7th 
quarter.  This  is  an  important  observation,  because  according  to  the  BCBS  (2010),  the 
announcement  of  an  increase  in  the  countercyclical  capital  buffer  (CCyB)  takes  four 
quarters  to  be  effective.  The  same  interpretation  is  valid  for  leverage  because  this 
variable  is  similar  to  the  capital  buffer  and  thus  it  represents  a  relation  between  the 
capital  and  the  bank’s  assets.  The  shock  transmitted  through  interest  rate  to  credit 
provisions  (second  graph  in  figure  5)  does  not  show  lag  for  seeing  statistical 
significance. A possible justification for this result is that, in a different manner from the 
previous instruments, there is no schedule of adjustment for this instrument (time to be 
effective).

4. Conclusion  

 
Based  on  an  original  database  built  from  balance  sheets  provided  by  Central 
Bank of Brasil of 121 banks for a whole of 58 quarters (March 2001 to June 2015), this 
study  investigated  empirically  the  relation  between  macroprudential  policy  and 
monetary  policy.  In  particular,  the  effect  of  the  monetary  policy  interest  rate  on  the 
instruments  for  macroprudential  financial  institutions-based  policies  (capital  buffer, 
credit provisions, and leverage) was analyzed.  

The empirical evidence in this study allows one to see that the monetary policy 
 
affects  macroprudential  instruments.  The  findings  indicate  that  an  increase  in  the 
monetary policy interest rate takes banks to increase capital buffer and credit provisions 
and to decrease leverage. A possible explanation for this reaction is the banks’ forward-
looking behavior causing the banks to anticipate a scenario of an increase in the interest 
rate.  Therefore,  when  there  is  an  increase  in  the  monetary  policy  interest  rate,  banks 
expect  a deterioration of the economy and thus  adopt  a  conservative  position  (amplify

IR Innovationthe  protection  through  macroprudential  instruments).  On  the  other  hand,  a  decrease  in 
the interest  rate takes banks to  accept  more  risk, which, in  turn, can represent  a threat 
for the financial stability. In brief, under a scenario of an increase in the interest rate the 
financial system becomes more solid. However, when there is a decrease in the interest 
rate  the  system  tends  to  be  fragile  which,  in  turn,  demands  actions  from  the 
macroprudential supervisor. 

 
It is important to highlight that the main objective of the monetary policy is not 
to  guarantee  the  financial  stability.  However,  the  effects  that  the  monetary  policy 
interest rate causes on macroprudential instruments cannot be neglected. Therefore, it is 
mandatory to aggregate to the macroprudential policy the possibility of interconnection 
with the monetary policy in order to guarantee financial stability.

Note:  Probabilities  for  Fisher  tests  are  computed  using  an  asymptotic  Chi-square  distribution.  All 
other  tests  assume  asymptotic  normality.  Automatic  lag  difference  term  and  bandwidth  selection 
(using  the  Schwarz  criterion  for  the  lag  differences,  and  the  Newey-West  method  and  the  Bartlett 
kernel for the bandwidth). Exogenous variables: individual effects.
