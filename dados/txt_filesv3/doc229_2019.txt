Abstract

This paper aims to empirically analyse the Urban Wage Premium (UWP) of Metropolitan Areas (MAs) in Brazil but it differs from
previous studies by: (i) investigating the UWP for both sectors (formal and informal) by using a recent longitudinal database, the
Continuous National Household Sample Survey (PNADC); (ii) the possibility of applying a sample selection correction, since
it’s possible to reconstruct the panel of individuals who become unemployed; (iii) a geographic approach that includes a very
concentrated urban structure and; (iv) addressing the role of personal, ﬁrm and occupational characteristics in UWP composition at
different agglomeration levels and evaluating the role of the sorting of individuals with the decomposition of wage differentials
between the MAs. The results, supported by robustness checks, indicate that there is a UWP for workers in MAs, but it’s decreasing
as agglomeration becomes denser. The formal workers UWP is in line with previous studies while the informal workers UWP
drives the overall results, showing a decreasing behaviour. The fact that there is a distinct UWP pattern between these groups,
according to the agglomeration level, is new in UWP studies for Brazil since the majority of them are focused on formal workers.
The analysis of the characteristics indicates that workers in high-skilled occupations or with a higher level of education are better
paid when located in denser areas, regardless if in formal or informal jobs. However, informal workers in low-skilled occupations
or with lower education level have a higher premium if located in Small MAs.

características pessoais, da ﬁrma e da ocupação na composição da UWP para diferentes níveis de aglomeração e avaliar o papel do
sorting dos indivíduos com a decomposição dos diferenciais salariais entre as MAs. Os resultados, apoiados por testes de robustez,
indicam que há UWP para trabalhadores nas MAs, mas ele diminui à medida que a aglomeração torna-se mais densa. O UWP dos
trabalhadores formais se mostra em linha com estudos anteriores, enquanto o UWP dos trabalhadores informais UWP impulsiona
os resultados globais, mostrando um comportamento decrescente conforme a MA se torna mais densa. O fato de existir um padrão

Introduction

A variety of studies on local labour markets analyse the existence of a positive wage differential in urban areas, known
as Urban Wage Premium (UWP). There is extensive empirical evidence of this premium, even after control for observable and
unobservable workers’ and ﬁrms’ characteristics and in the recent period, studies have shed light on how the UWP changes
according to the agglomeration scale, instead of considering the UWP as ﬁxed and homogeneous. As UWP empirical studies
rely on individual micro-data, they differ in scope, sample choice, and data availability, pointing results in different directions
demanding further research. Even with the recent advances in the UWP analysis, the vast majority of UWP studies for Brazil
do not comprises informal workers due to the use of administrative records. This fact is an essential gap, since this group
have non-despicable participation on the workforce. Another limitation is although recognizing that the movements between
employment and unemployment are distinct not only due to different workers’ proﬁles but also due to the dynamics of the local
labour markets in large agglomerations, data for the unemployed is not always available, which is why the authors, with few
exceptions, do not work out the potential sample selection bias.

In this context, the main aim of this paper is to analyse the UWP according the agglomeration scale in Brazil. Our
contribution relies on the investigation of the UWP for both sectors (formal and informal) and the application of Heckman’s
correction. With this focus, we evidence how the different workers’ characteristics are related to agglomeration levels for UWP
explanation and the possible sorting effect, decomposing the wage differentials by Oaxaca-Blinder method. This was only possible
due to the use of a recent longitudinal database on the Brazilian labour market, the Continuous National Household Sample
Survey (PNADC) from Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), with more than 577,000 workers from 2012 to 2018, a broad
geographic coverage, considering workers of all sectors and formality status.

After correcting the sample selection bias and controlling for workers’ observable characteristics, we estimated the
Metropolitan Area (MA) UWP, grouping the 27 Brazilian MAs based on their population levels. The results pointed to a
non-homogeneous and decreasing UWP as agglomeration becomes larger: 8.15% for Extra-Large MAs and 13.8% for Small MAs.
By exploring the workers’ formality status, it was possible to verify that formal workers UWP is in line with previous studies,
while informal workers UWP drives the overall results, showing a decreasing behaviour. The fact that there is a distinct UWP
pattern between these groups, according to the agglomeration level, was never elucidated in UWP studies for Brazil.

Through additional regressions, including variables interaction, it was possible to understand how workers’ and ﬁrms’
characteristics explain the UWP according to agglomeration scale. Robustness checks conﬁrm the UWP results even when
including different samples and periods, alternative agglomeration scale deﬁnitions or additional variables. Even with data
limitations, a non-negligible part of individuals’ ﬁxed effects can be explained by being located in MAs and investigating the
components of wage differentials between MAs and Non-MAs or between Formal and Informal workers, it was possible to identify
that the level of individuals’ attributes can explain the highest part.

This paper is composed of 4 sections, besides this introduction: section 2 presents the background and motivation, and
reviews the UWP literature; section 3 presents data, descriptive analysis and empirical strategy; section 4 shows the estimation
results based on different econometric models and methods, as well as robustness tests; and ﬁnally, section 5 presents the ﬁnal
remarks.

2 Background

The literature presents extensive evidence of a wage differential favourable to workers in Metropolitan Areas (MAs),
even after controlling for personal, occupational and ﬁrm characteristics, known as the urban wage premium (UWP). Researches
Duranton and Puga (2004) consolidate the theoretical micro-foundations of agglomerations economies - a milestone in this
research. They identify how agglomerations can foster wage gains as they provide: i) a reduction of costs associated with the
search for new jobs by individuals and the search for candidates by ﬁrms (sharing); ii) greater possibilities to ﬁnd employment and
promote better matches between ﬁrms and workers (matching); and iii), spillover of ideas and new skills development (learning).
Therefore, human capital (learning) can be a channel to analyse UWP, in which populated areas have a higher concentration of
more educated people (sorting), and foster a more extensive and faster accumulation of human capital, with knowledge spillovers
and gains from experience (ANDERSSON; THULIN, 2013; MORETTI, 2011; MORETTI, 2013; BEHRENS; DURANTON;
ROBERT-NICOUD, 2014; ROCA; PUGA, 2017).

Studies report that wage differentials are not homogeneous among individuals but may vary according to the composition
of workers’ abilities and gains from experience, as well as the combined effect of them (as in Rosenthal and Strange (2008)).

Similarly, the UWP can also be inﬂuenced by the speciﬁc features of the labour market in denser areas due to the matching process
between individuals and ﬁrms and through the transitions between jobs and occupations. In denser labour markets, ﬁrms gain
access to a large pool of skilled workers, who in turn gain access to a more signiﬁcant number of potential employers and suitable
job positions, reducing the period of unemployment and risk of being unemployed (BAUM-SNOW; PAVAN, 2011). However,
job transitions, which occur in the higher degree in populated areas, are also a way to obtain wage gains and to promote career
advancements (NEVES-JR; AZZONI; CHAGAS, 2018; MATANO; NATICCHIONI, 2016).

In this context, according to Heuermann, Halfdanarson and Suedekum (2010), UWP can be empirically analysed by
highlighting when the worker beneﬁts from it. Concerning the UWP size at the wage level, one of the most important empirical
studies is Glaeser and Mare (2001), which found evidence of a UWP in the United States between 1970 and 1990 of approximately
25% for large agglomerations, which, when controlling for individual observable and unobservable characteristics reduces to 4.5%
remaining signiﬁcant. Other studies also reveal the existence of a UWP different countries, and the results vary from 2.6% to
14.0% in benchmark estimations, reducing to 0.3% to 5,1% after controlling for workers’ and ﬁrms’ characteristics1. For Brazilian
labour market, a UWP of 5.2% was identiﬁed by Chauvin et al. (2017) in benchmark estimations for Micro-regions, and of 3.4%
by Silva, Santos and Freguglia (2016) in MAs between 1995 and 2008, after controlling for workers’ characteristics2.

Recent studies tend to identify how speciﬁc workers’ and ﬁrms’ characteristics can explain the UWP. Most of these
studies are focused on analysing the relationship between the agglomeration level and the workers’ schooling level (MORETTI,
2004; SILVA; SANTOS; FREGUGLIA, 2016) and job tenure (GLAESER; MARE, 2001; ROCHA; NETO; GOMES, 2011;
CARLSEN; RATTSØ; STOKKE, 2016). Another group of studies evaluates the relevance of the workers’ ability to determine
UWP, with different concepts for skill level (GOULD, 2007; BACOLOD; BLUM; STRANGE, 2009; ANDERSSON; THULIN,
2013; NEVES-JR; AZZONI; CHAGAS, 2017).

From the methodological point of view, it is important to evaluate the existence of sample selection bias, since wages
are only observe for employed individuals. However, the data for unemployed are not always available, so the vast majority of
UWP studies disregard the propensity to be employed. Exceptions are the studies of Baum-Snow and Pavan (2011) and Gould
(2007) that take into account the fact of being unemployed as a counter-factual analysis.Still concerning the applied methods,
although much used in the investigation of the wage differential among groups of workers, few studies use the decomposition as
an alternative to investigate wage differentials between regions3. The use of this method is appropriate because it makes possible
to separate the wages differentials between the part corresponding to the workers’ characteristics (which may indicate the presence
and the magnitude of sorting in denser areas) and the part related to the local labour market dynamics.

Another limitation, quite frequent in the Brazilian literature, is to identify the UWP using administrative registers ﬁlled
by ﬁrms, then restricting the analysis to formal workers4. In Brazil, this is relevant because informal workers have non-despicable
participation in the workforce, from 2012 to 2018 approximately 25.4% of the working-age population according to IBGE (2018a).

3 Data and empirical strategy

3.1 Data and sample

The chosen database is the Continuous National Household Sample Survey (PNADC) from Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics (IBGE). It’s a household survey with national coverage and a quarterly frequency for approximately
211,000 interviews in a rotating scheme, ﬁve consecutive quarters per household (IBGE, 2018b). PNADC allows workers analysis
according to their location, type of contract, individuals’, occupations’ and ﬁrms’ characteristics. For the period from 2012 to 2018
PNADC presents more than 15.8 million observations. After inconsistencies exclusions, we withdrew public sector workers and
those from the Army, due to their speciﬁc labour laws. The sample consists of workers with a single job and with at least 20 hours
a week and contemplates only employed men aged 18-655 totalising almost 557,000 workers and 2.8 million observations.

Workers that move during the survey are missing after the change, which implies that it does not cover migration between

1Such studies report a UWP in order of 5.1% in Norway (CARLSEN; RATTSØ; STOKKE, 2016), 3.0% in France (COMBES; DURANTON; GOBILLON, 2008),
between 1.4% and 7.1% in England according to the MA size (D’COSTA; OVERMAN, 2014), 0.2% in Italy (BELLOC; NATICCHIONI; VITTORI, 2018),
between 2.0% and 4.9% in Germany (BERLINGIERI, 2017; DAUTH et al., 2016), between 0.3% e 1.4% in Netherlands depending of the local employment
density (MEEKES; HASSINK, 2018).
2Other studies also evidence UWP in Brazil using different speciﬁcations as Rocha, Neto and Gomes (2011) who ﬁnd an additional of 0.45 minimum wage in
benchmark estimations and 0.12 minimum wage after controlling for the individuals’ characteristics.
3Cirino and Lima (2012) applied the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to understand the wage differentials, between two speciﬁc MAs in Brazil for 2006
4We also observe this fact in studies across the globe, mainly for the group of self-employed. In Brazil, the informal workers are often not included, as in the
studies of Silva, Santos and Freguglia (2016), Rocha, Neto and Gomes (2011) and Neves-Jr, Azzoni and Chagas (2018), due to the use of RAIS-MIGRA, the
Annual Social Information Relation database, an administrative record of ﬁrms and workers collected by the Ministry of Economy. The only study that included
informal workers in UWP analysis for Brazil is Cruz and Naticchioni (2012), which found evidence of it for MAs (17%) and formal workers (23%), but without
sample selection correction and not controlling for individuals’ unobservable characteristics, given database limitations.
5The choice of men eliminates possible variations susceptible to discrimination, and the male workforce has a more stable behaviour despite adverse conditions
such as low wages, high unemployment and poor working conditions, according to Menezes-Filho, Mendes and Almeida (2004).

regions; all the workers are in the same place throughout the research. The second case of attrition in this database emerges from
workers that didn’t answer the survey at any moment in the ﬁve quarters. Correction for attrition was not applied in this paper, but
we try to deal with this possible bias looking at different sample cohorts as robustness check (see section 4.3). Besides, the values
reported as wages are self-declared, which may be biased for declaration errors6. The PNADC shows a household identiﬁer7,
but does not present a longitudinal identiﬁer for individuals at the household. To be able to evaluate individuals over time, we
construct an identiﬁer based on the date of the birth of each member at the household. Besides that, all descriptive analysis and
estimations make use of individual sample weight available on PNADC (variable V1028).

In order to analyse the agglomerations, we made a distinction between MAs (that correspond to State Capital and
respective MAs or only State Capital totalling 27 MAs) and Non-MA. To evaluate the agglomeration level we subdivided the
MAs according to their population into four groups. Table 1 shows the composition of each group. These approach condenses two
applications found in the literature (by MA and by the number of inhabitants) and is the most suitable approach possible with this
database. [Table 1 about here.]

3.2 Descriptive analysis

A non-negligible part of the working-age individuals are informal in Brazil. As can be seen in Table 2, although formal
workers still represent a greater part of the working-age population, informal workers and non-employed represents 58.1% of
them. The deﬁnition for informal workers comprises the cases where employed individuals or self-employed reported not have
a formal contract (those in compliance with labour regulations) or do not contribute to the Social Security Institute. Being an
informal worker means they do not have access to several beneﬁts provided, by labour laws, such as unemployment beneﬁts, job
severance payments (for maternity leaves, death, illnesses, occupational accidents, among others) and public retirement. According
to Yahmed (2018), workers with identical productivity, in a frictionless market, should earn higher wages to compensate for the
absence of those beneﬁts. However, by the dualistic view of the labour markets, formal jobs offers, on average, higher wages than
informal jobs. The heterogeneity on workers’ observable and unobservable attributes could explains this situation.

Descriptive analysis show differences between the individuals’ characteristics for the working age population in Brazil
(Table 2). Formal workers have, on average, almost three schooling years above informal workers, although they are slightly
younger. They also have a lower household structure with fewer children and members, and are mostly composed of workers
in high or medium-skilled occupations and with at least High School. While informal workers, on average, work fewer hours
per week and have a lower job tenure. More in-depth analyses shown that, in general, MAs have a bigger share of workers in
high-skilled occupations and with high-schooling levels compared to Non-MAs and in both sectors (formal/informal). Concerning
the formal workers, those college-educated represent between 27.6% and 30.7% of total employees in MAs and only 20% in
Non-MAs. Workers in high-skilled occupations reach 27.3% in Extra-large MAs but are only 18.5% in Non-MAs. Informal
workers are more concentrated in Non-MAs (42.9% vs 31.8%) and have smaller participation in the total number of workers as the
agglomeration increases, reaching 28.4% in Extra-Large MAs. College-educated informal workers only reach a maximum of
14.8%, being, on average, only 8.5% of total employees. They are also mostly in low-skilled occupations (easily surpassing 46%
of total informal workers on each agglomeration level).

The spatial wage differentials in Brazil is easily observed in a wages comparison between locations. Metropolitan Areas
(MAs) show higher mean wages than Non-MAs with a non-homogeneous trend growth according to the size of the MAs. The
descriptive analysis for the sample shows that the wages difference between MAs and Non-MAs is relevant (about 30% in favour
of MA, 15.9 vs 11.1) and within the MAs group, the difference is also meaningful (about 36% in favour of Extra-large MAs
compared to Small MAs, 18.8 vs 12.0). Table 4 shows the mean hourly wage in different locations for workers in different
categories. Following the literature, wages are higher among more educated workers and with higher job tenure. The different skill
levels reveal relative wage differentials in favour of workers in high-skilled occupations in Extra-large MAs compared to Small
MAs (47.2 vs 27.8). Among workers in occupations with low skill level, the difference is only 12% in favour of Extra-large MAs
(10.6 vs 9.3). Wages are also higher in Extra-Large MAs for both formality status (formal/informal). [Table 2, 3 and 4 about here.]

3.3 Empirical strategy

The methodology traditionally used in UWP studies, and adopted here for different agglomeration sizes, is a panel data
approach with Ordinary Least Squares Pooled (Pooled OLS) and Fixed-Effects estimates, controlling for individuals’, occupations’,
and ﬁrms’ characteristics. We ﬁrst investigate the existence of sample selection bias adopting the correction procedure in two steps
following Heckman (1979). The ﬁrst one is an estimation for the probability of being employed where we consider a data set with

6Although the survey question speciﬁes gross values is expected that the interviewees could interpret it as net taxes amounts. In this sense, Corseuil and Santos
(2002) estimate that PNADC wages are 10% lower than the existing administrative records, comparing only formal workers.
7The household identiﬁer comprises the variables: Primary Sampling Unit (UPA), household number (V1008) and panel identiﬁcation(V1014)

all men aged 18-65 employed, non-employed or inactive, in the period of analysis, with the following speciﬁcation:

Li = α1 + α2M Ai + α3Agei + α4Age2

i + α5Racei + α6M aritalstatusi + α7SchLeveli
+α8U nemployment + α9HHheadi + α10N oChildi + α11Child6i + α12Child14i
+α13HHwagei + α14HHpeoplei + α15P osHSi + M acroRegioni + Ti + νi

(1)

In equation (1) Li represents the probability of being employed. Besides the variables that represent the individual characteristics
(see Appendix A for the variables deﬁnition) six household variables denote explicitly the probability of being employed: N oChild,
Child6, Child14, HHwage, HHpeople, and P osHS. The Ti variable represents the set of dummies for year and quarters,
while νit is the error term. In this ﬁrst step, the Inverse Mills’ Ratio (IMR) will indicate the existence of sample selection bias and
then the second step consists in estimate the equation for wages considering the IMR as a control variable, obtaining consistent
parameters. This estimation presents the following mincerian form, applied to Pooled OLS:

lnhwageit = β1 + β2M Ait + β3Ageit + β4Age2
it + β5Raceit + β6M aritalstatusit
+β7HHheadit + β8OccSkillit + β9F ormalityit + β10T enureit + β11SchLevelit+
β12U nemployment + β13λ + Industryit + M acroRegionit + Tt + it

(2)

where the dependent variable lnhwage is the logarithm form of the hourly wage of worker i at time t temporally deﬂated using
the INPC deﬂator, λ is the Inverse Mills’ Ratio and it is the error term. The analysis will focus on the coefﬁcient β2 that will
show how much the agglomeration is determinant for the UWP. Appendix B shows the estimation details of these two steps.
Following the literature, to capture the demand side effects considering the state of the local labour markets we include the variable
U nemployment that measure the level of unemployed according to the year, quarter, Macro-Region, MA (or Non-MA) and
Schooling level.

The results were obtained for all MAs together and with a separation by agglomeration scale. Considering the differences
between formal and informal workers, we perform separately Pooled OLS estimations. Besides that, to deepen the analysis about
the role of individuals’ characteristics, interactions were made between some variables to identify their relation to the UWP of each
agglomeration level. The econometric speciﬁcation of the equation (2) then includes the interaction of the variable M Ait with
Occupational skill (Occskillit), Schooling level (SchLevelit), and Tenure (T enureit). As robustness checks, several exercises
were applied, as described in section 4.3.

For a precise UWP identiﬁcation it’s necessary to control the individuals’ unobservable characteristics using Fixed-Effects
method. However, the available data do not contemplates the workers that migrate across regions, making it impossible to estimate
the coefﬁcients for the MAs dummies. So, we chosen to perform a procedure inspired by Combes, Duranton and Gobillon (2008)
and Meekes and Hassink (2018) that consists of an estimation of ﬁxed effects and its’ regression by the time ﬁxed characteristics,
obtaining an indication of how much of the ﬁxed-effects is associated with characteristics of the individuals’ location. The intention
of doing this is to isolate the individuals’ effects and evaluate the role of the agglomerations.

Finally, we applied the Oaxaca-Blinder method8 to understand how the wages differentials between MAs can be explained
by the individuals’ attributes or by the remuneration dynamics in the local labour markets. This method offered additional evidence
for the role of sorting and was performed comparing MAs versus Non-MAs and formal versus informal workers. All estimations
make use of individual sample weight provided by IBGE (2018a) and clustered standard errors by individuals.

4 Results

4.1 Observing the UWP in agglomerations

Since, the existence of sample selection bias was veriﬁed (Appendix B report the results for each stage of the process),
the results reported below always refer to estimates corrected by the Heckman’s procedure. Table 5 presents estimates of different
speciﬁcations for the equation (2). The ﬁrst two regressions, only with the MA dummy, show the raw effect of sample selection
correction, then controls are added gradually: dummies for time, industries, formality, and Macro-Region (3), workers’ observable
characteristics and unemployment rates (4) and, ﬁnally, occupations’ characteristics (tenure and skill levels)(5). However, as the
focus of this paper is to analyse the effect of the agglomeration scale on UWP, the most interesting speciﬁcation is regression 10
with dummies for four MA agglomeration levels, being this model our reference. Estimates 6 to 9 are reduced forms following the
addition of the same controls described earlier. The regressions for the agglomeration levels show relevant changes with sample
selection correction (models 6 and 7) especially for Small and Medium MAs, increasing their coefﬁcient in more than three
percentage points. In general, other variables coefﬁcients are in line with the literature. All models conﬁrm the existence of a UWP
in Brazil. The effect of MAs on wages is initially 26.9% in the most basic model (1) and reduces to 9.4% with all controls (5). The
coefﬁcients in the model 10 indicate a non-homogeneous UWP according to agglomeration scale. Although always positive, while

Extra-large MAs have a differential of 8.1%, the other MAs showed a higher level of 13.8% and 10.0% respectively for Large,
Medium and Small MAs.

This decreasing behaviour is not in line with the majority of studies in the literature, that point an increasing UWP with
agglomeration scale. One possible approach is to investigate, considering the differentials between formal and informal workers,
whether the UWP is different. Table 6 shows the Pooled OLS estimations separately for the two groups and the reference model.
Comparing against the Non-MA, MAs’ formal workers have an 8.2% UWP, a lower result than informal workers, with 11.9%. The
UWP results are very different analysing by Agglomeration level: formal workers have a higher UWP in Extra-large MAs (9.5%)
while informal workers in Small MAs (20.3%). Both groups show a non-homogeneous UWP according to agglomeration scale,
but for formal workers, they vary between 5.6% and 9.5%, while informal workers have more elasticity, between 6.8% and 20.3%.
Informal workers UWP drives the overall results, that replicates the decreasing behaviour as the agglomeration level rise. It was
never elucidated in UWP studies the fact that there is a distinct pattern between these groups according to the agglomeration level.
Workers‘ characteristics of each group could motivate these results, the reason why they will be tested in the next section, where
the UWP analysis is deepened using variables interactions. [Table 5 and 6 about here.]

4.2 UWP deep analysis

Our ﬁrst results point to a non-homogeneous UWP in agglomeration scale and distinct behaviour between formal and
informal workers. In this context, we analyse in more detail how the UWP can be explained by different characteristics of local
labour market composition. Results in Table 7 include three interaction terms with agglomeration scale dummies: occupational
skills, schooling levels and tenure. Replicated estimations were made for formal and informal workers separately (see the Appendix
C), but besides the coefﬁcients for the interaction terms, we summarised the aggregate effects of each interaction on each group, to
ease results interpretation, and reported below the most important ﬁndings. [Table 7 about here.]
Occupational Skill. Workers in high and middle-skilled occupations in all MA levels present a wage premium compared to
low-skilled ones. The net effect range from 15% to 17% for medium-skilled and from 56% and 66% to high-skilled occupations
(Figure 1c). However, the decreasing premium according to agglomeration scale for Medium-OS workers turns into an increasing
pattern for those with High-OS. So, workers in high-skilled occupations are the most beneﬁted in larger MAs, fact observed in
others studies even with different skills speciﬁcation, like Gould (2007) and Bacolod, Blum and Strange (2009). Besides that, as
can be seen in Figure 1(a-b), informal workers in medium-skilled occupations present a higher UWP in all MAs, comparing with
formal workers, and it is double in Small MAs compared to Extra-large MAs. These results indicate that workers in medium-skilled
occupations beneﬁts of a greater UWP when allocated at Small MAs and in informal jobs.

Schooling levels. Educated workers have higher premiums than similar ones in Non-MAs locations. The aggregate effect shows
that workers with lower schooling levels (until high school) present a wage premium in MAs, but it is lower in denser areas (Figure
2c). For college-educated workers, that is a reversed pattern as the higher the MA, the greater the UWP. Both groups, formal
and informal workers, present similar results, although with distinct magnitudes. Again, the UWP for informal worker surpasses
the formal workers at any agglomeration and schooling level (Figure 2a-b), and very educated workers earn more in very dense
regions on both groups.
Tenure. There is a wage penalty that reaches up to 10.0% for new employees (up to one year) in Extra-Large cities, but it reduces
as experience consolidates (Figure 3c). After 4 years in the same job, the penalty dissipates, and a positive UWP are found, being
higher in less dense areas. The aggregate effect report different results for formal and informal workers (Figure 3a-b). While

6

formal workers with a shorter job tenure have a wage penalty (T1 and T2) and slightly close effects for workers with 4 to 8 years
tenure, informal workers have a positive UWP from 1 year regardless the agglomeration level (or before that if in a Small or
Medium MA). Even though our analyses do not evaluate time trends, this evidence suggests an acceptance of wage penalties on
formal jobs, at the beginning of employment, maybe because workers foresee more signiﬁcant gains over time. Same prospects are

4.3 Robustness checks

This section is dedicated to robustness exercises that include different samples, periods, alternative agglomeration scale
deﬁnitions, and additional variables. In general, the UWP primarily results for agglomerations levels hold on each exercise, and
they are explained below and reported in Table 8 and 9.
Attrition and panel tests. The two ﬁrst tests are related to the fact that the database consists of an unbalanced panel. The ﬁrst

7

test (A) comprises only the ﬁrst observation (ﬁrst interview answer of each worker) followed by test (B) that comprises only
individuals with at least two answers (the ﬁrst to interviews or any combination between the 5 quarters). Both tests show coefﬁcient
for MAs similar to the benchmark model.
Firm size. Following the literature, we evidence the role of ﬁrm size in the UWP performing an exercise with the same speciﬁcation
for equation 2 including a new variable, F irmsize. Exercise C reports, as expected, that ﬁrm size has a positive and increasing
effect on wages, and MAs UWP levels are quite similar to benchmark model results. Since new results indicate, an even lower
wage gap Extra-large MAs, as pointed in the literature, not control for the presence of large ﬁrms in denser areas could overestimate
UWP in these locations. Exercises D and E deepen the analysis of ﬁrm size, with separated regression according to the periods
when this variable is available. On both, ﬁrm size remains signiﬁcant.
Weekly worked hours. The primary sample comprises only workers with a minimum of 20 weekly worked hours than Exercise
F took into account all workers without worked hours restriction. The UWP in this exercise showed similar coefﬁcients for
Agglomeration levels compared to the benchmark model.
Alternative Agglomeration Scale deﬁnitions. Concerning the agglomeration speciﬁcation and the possibilities of our database, we
performed three ﬁnal robustness checks. The former (exercise G) reclassiﬁes the MAs according to their demographic density
(inhabitants per km2) in four new groups being Small MAs the ones’ with less than 100, Medium MAs between 100 and 417
(median level), Large MAs between 417 and 1.000 and Extra-large MAs above 1.000. The following speciﬁcation (exercise
H) takes the Cities’ Inﬂuence Regions (Região de Inﬂuência das Cidades) from IBGE (2008), that classiﬁes the urban centres
according to the intensity of the links between them. Both of these exercises showed similar coefﬁcients for Agglomeration levels
compared to the base model. Finally, the last exercise takes the MA population logarithm as the area identiﬁer. The effect of
population logarithm on hourly wages is small (1.1%) but positive and statistically signiﬁcant. Between the two groups analysed
(formal/informal), different behaviour was found, although both signiﬁcant the population logarithm affect hourly wages positively
for formal workers (+2.2%) and negatively for informal workers (-1.3%), consistent with the previous results on Pooled OLS
estimations. [Table 8 and 9 about here.]

4.4 Controlling the unobservable characteristics

In an attempt to control the unobservable characteristics of individuals, even with the limitations of the database (described
in section 3.3), we made two estimations9. The ﬁrst one is the estimation by Fixed Effects, shown in Table 10(a) and comparing the
coefﬁcients with Pooled OLS. As expected, the coefﬁcients are smaller but continue to demonstrate wage differentials according
to speciﬁc characteristics. The second estimation corresponds to regress the individuals’ ﬁxed effects, previously estimated, as the
dependent variable. In this case, the control variables are only those that do not vary on time: individuals’ location (agglomeration
Scale and Macro-Region), age and race. The results (Table 10(b)) show that being in an MA explains between 20.6% and 28.5%
of the individuals’ ﬁxed effects. [Table 10 about here.]

4.5 Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition

The last set of estimates comprises the application of the decomposition method. As shown in Table 11, the higher wage
levels in favour of MAs versus Non-MAs are mainly due to the individuals’ attributes (65.4%). The lower part is due to the
difference in coefﬁcients, 32.5%, that is, explained by the difference in the remuneration dynamics of the local labour market.
To deepen the analysis, we applied the decomposition method for formal workers against informal workers and identiﬁed that
the wage differentials are also explained mostly by the individuals’ attributes (50.1%) than by the local labour market dynamics
(34.8%). [Tables 11 about here.]

5 Final remarks

In this paper, we analyse empirically the relationship between UWP and agglomeration levels deepening the analysis of
workers’ characteristics, formality status and understanding the wage differentials explanation (by the individual’s attributes or the
local labour markets dynamics). We use a large and recent longitudinal panel with information for Brazilian workers, based on a
household survey (PNADC), which also allows us to investigate whether there is a different evidences of UWP between formal
and informal workers, and correct the sample selection bias with Heckman’s procedure. The results add new insights for UWP
explanation in Brazil, especially related to informal workers.

The UWP was estimated for MAs (versus Non-MAs), and between MAs subdivided according to agglomeration size.
The results pointed to a non-homogeneous and decreasing UWP as agglomeration becomes larger: 8.15% for Extra-Large MAs
and 13.8% for Small MAs. By exploring the workers’ formality status, it was possible to verify that for formal workers UWP is in

line with previous studies while informal workers UWP drives the overall results, repeating the decreasing behaviour. It was never
elucidated in UWP studies the fact that there is a distinct pattern between these groups according to the agglomeration level.

Through additional regressions, including variables interaction, it was possible to understand how they explain the UWP
according to agglomeration scale. Important differences in these interactions show up in the separated analyses according to the
formality status. Workers in high-skilled occupations are the most beneﬁted in larger MAs while workers in medium-skilled
occupations beneﬁts of a greater UWP when allocated at Small MAs and in informal jobs. Workers with low-educated levels
(up to High School) earn more in MAs, but this premium decreases as the agglomeration size increase. Reversed results were
found for college-educated workers, the higher the MA, the higher the UWP. Whereas for formal workers with a shorter job
tenure a wage penalty shows up (T1 and T2) and slightly close premium for workers with 4 to 8 years tenure versus older tenure
workers. Informal workers have a positive UWP from 1 year regardless the agglomeration level (or before that if allocated in a
Small or Medium MA). Robustness checks conﬁrm the UWP results even when including different samples, periods, alternative
agglomeration scale deﬁnitions, additional variables, or using the population logarithm as the area speciﬁcation. Even with data
limitations, a non-negligible part of individuals’ ﬁxed effects can be explained by being located in agglomerated areas. Finally,
investigating the components of wage differentials it was possible to identify that the level of individuals’ attributes can explain
the greatest part.
