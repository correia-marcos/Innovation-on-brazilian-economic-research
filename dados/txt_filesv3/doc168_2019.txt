O objetivo deste artigo é identificar o efeito da acessibilidade ao emprego sobre a distribuição espacial da 
densidade  populacional  na  área  urbana  de  Salvador,  a  primeira  cidade  planejada  e  capital  do  Brasil. 
Salvador é uma cidade com uma dinâmica sócio-espacial complexa, marcada principalmente pela evolução 
heterogênea da ocupação histórica de seu espaço urbano, alta segregação entre brancos e negros e entre 
pobres e ricos, e uma configuração espacial policêntrica de centros de emprego. Esta pesquisa fundamenta-
se  na  literatura  da  economia  urbana  sobre  a  intensidade  do  uso  do  espaço  urbano  e  seus  padrões  de 
centralidade e acessibilidade. Consideramos o uso corrente dos sistemas de transporte público e privado 
para  calcular  um  índice  de  acessibilidade  por  subzona  de  transporte  para  identificar  a  relação  entre 
densidade  populacional  (total,  negros  e  brancos)  e  acessibilidade.  Nossa  estratégia  de  identificação 
considerou  o  controle  por  componentes  invariantes  no  tempo,  como  variáveis  históricas  de  formação  e 
ocupação  da  cidade.  Em  seguida,  aplicou-se  uma  estimação  de  dois  estágios  baseada  em  uma  variável 
instrumental hidrológica, uma vez que a evolução das avenidas da cidade acompanhou a rota de seus rios. 
Os resultados por raça mostraram que a acessibilidade teve um efeito positivo na densidade populacional, 
com sinais e valores semelhantes aos da população em geral. Menor possibilidade de alcançar empregos 
deve justificar menor demanda por moradias em espaços urbanos mais distantes.

Abstract: 
The  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  identify  the  effect  of  job  accessibility  on  the  spatial  distribution  of 
population density in the urban area of Salvador, the first planned and capital city of Brazil. Salvador is a 
city with a complex socio-spatial dynamic, marked mainly by the heterogeneous evolution of the historical 
occupation of its urban space, high segregation between white and black and between poor and rich people, 
and a polycentric spatial configuration of job centers. This research lies on the urban economics literature 
about the intensity of the use of urban space and its patterns of centrality and accessibility. We considered 
the current use of public and private transportation systems to calculate an accessibility index by transport 
subzone to identify the relation between population density (total, blacks and white) and accessibility. Our 
identification  strategy  considered  control  by  time  invariant  components,  such  as  historical  variables  of 
formation  and occupation of the  city. Then, a two-step estimation  based  on a hydrological  instrumental 
variable was applied, since the evolution of avenues of the city followed the route of its rivers. The results 
by race showed that accessibility had a positive effect on population density, with similar signs and values 
to  those  for  the  general  population.  Lower  possibility  of  reaching  jobs  should  justify  lower  demand  for 
housing in more distant urban spaces. 
Key-words: job accessibility; population density; urban economics, public and private transportation 
systems.

1. Introduction 
 
Salvador is the capital city of the state of Bahia and was also the first planned and capital city of Brazil, 
from 1549 to 1763, when the federal capital was transferred to the city of Rio de Janeiro, remaining there 
up to 1960. From then on, the planned city of Brasília has been the Brazilian capital. The primary urban 
nucleus of Salvador was planned, and its adjacent areas formed the main urban center of the city until the 
second half of the 20th  century, when its social, economic  and political  axis  was displaced towards the 
Atlantic border to form a second main urban nucleus. Currently, the central and most important urban areas 
of the city are inhabited predominantly by a white population, which represents only less than 1/5 of the 
total residents. This implies a strong socio-spatial segregation of population. On the other hand, deficits of 
public transport led workers from peripheral regions far away from dynamic urban spaces that concentrate 
the economic activity of the city, resulting in strong inequality in the access to employment opportunities 
for different population groups in the city. 
On this socio-spatial urban context, this research lies on the urban economics literature about the intensity 
of frictions in the use of the urban space and its patterns of centrality and accessibility, aiming to identify 
the  effect  of  job  accessibility  on  the  spatial  distribution  of  population  density.  The  accessibility  to 
employment expresses the relationship between regional economic activity and transport infrastructure and 
can be measured by indicators which are sensitive to changes in the transportation system and the pattern 
of land occupation (CASCETTA et al., 2013; GEURS; VAN WEE, 2004; INGRAM, 1971). Taking the 
monocentric system of the first generation of urban economics models of Alonso (1964), Mills (1967) and 
Muth (1969), this literature supposes a homogeneous link structure covering a representative city and the 
demographic  density  distancing  from  the  Central  Business  District  (CBD).  However,  because  of  the 
important role that accessibility has in population distribution and in the formation of different patterns of 
agglomerations and centralities within metropolises, this paper searches theoretical support in the literature 
on  non-monocentric  urban  configurations  of  cities,  such  as  Fujita  and  Krugman  (1995),  Henderson  and 
Mitra (1996), and Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg (2002). 
Transport infrastructure has a long-term impact on land use patterns. Since land use itself can determine 
the  distribution  of  public  investments  in  transportation  that  directly  affects  accessibility,  the  causality 
between  accessibility  and  land  use  is  not  clear.  Identification  strategies  that  can  be  used  to  identify  the 
effects of accessibility on population density might be found in Baum-Snow (2007), Garcia-Lopez (2012) 
and  Haddad  and  Barufi  (2016).  This  latter  applies  a  hydrographic  instrumental  variable  to  identify  the 
causal effect of accessibility in a large urban area, considering pre-urban watercourses as a determinant for 
the location of transport infrastructure, and is the reference for the identification strategy of this paper. 
Our first research question is: what is the effect of accessibility on the pattern of population density in the 
city of Salvador? Considering the socio-spatial segregation in this city, the hypothesis of the paper is that 
the unbalanced use of urban space among different segments of the population can also be explained by job 
accessibility  and  that  this  effect  varies  between  population  groups  of  whites  and  blacks.  To  capture  the 
vectors of employment distribution and the quality of transportation, different accessibility indexes were 
produced, considering the commuting among the city’s transport subzones by private car and public bus, 
both with and without congestion. Because of the restrictions imposed by a cross-section dataset used, the 
identification strategy considered control by time invariant components first, such as historical variables of 
formation and occupation of the city. After that, a two-step estimation based on a hydrological instrumental 
variable was applied, given that the evolution of urban avenues of the city followed the route of its main 
rivers. 
The paper is composed of 5 sections more. Section 2 presents the formation and land use distribution of the 
population  of  Salvador,  which  resulted  in  an  unbalanced  access  to  job  opportunities  and  a  racial  socio-
spatial segregation. Section 3 deals with the theoretical reference and applied research literature. In Section

4,  the  details  of  the  database  and  accessibility  index  are  present.  Section  5  presents  the  statistical  and 
econometric results. The final remarks are reported in Section 6. 
 
2. Historical formation and occupation of the urban space of the city of Salvador 
 
Founded in 1549, Salvador was the first planned and capital city of Brazil (from 1549 to 1763), in the early 
stages of the country’s colonization by the Portuguese Kingdom, to centralize the planning of development 
and administration of the colony and its hereditary captaincies. The municipality’s building process took 
advantage of the natural conditions of the landscape, and that is why the primitive nucleus of the city was 
built at the margins of a navigable bay, the Baía de Todos os Santos (All Saints Bay), in the Northeast coast 
of Brazil. With the purpose of protecting the city, it was also built above a geological fault that divided the 
urban area into Cidade Alta and Cidade Baixa (“Hightown” and “Lowtown”), which can be seen in Figure 
1 (A). In these earlier times, Salvador was a municipality with Portuguese architecture and with complex 
urban form, since its formation.

From the 16th  to  the 18th  century, the  city  grew  under administrative divisions created by the Catholic 
church, and the population was composed of free residents and slaves. These divisions were recognized by 
the public administration as parishes. Catholic temples were built, with the wealth derived from slavery and 
mercantile activities, to become the headquarters of the parishes (NASCIMENTO, 2007). Parish priests 
were  responsible  for  the  religious  divisions  and,  for  this  reason,  became  strategic  for  the  population 
estimates that were carried out via ecclesiastical censuses. In 1757, Salvador had 28,410 inhabitants, which 
increased to 39,209 in 1780 and 45,000 in 1805 (TAVARES, 2011). 
Urban improvements regarding the transportation system were implemented before the 20th century. The 
railway  system  was  inaugurated  from  1860  to  1863  to  link  the  city  to  other  surrounding  municipalities 

 

3 

(Bahia’s Recôncavo region) (SANTOS et al., 2010). Steam engine vehicles connected the urban center to 
the  multiple  parishes  surrounding  it  in  1872.  In  1873,  a  large-scale  elevator  (the  well-known  Elevador 
Lacerda) started to work to transport population from Cidade Alta to Cidade Baixa (and vice versa). The 
main  streets  had  service  of  coal  gas  lighting  since  1863  to  facilitate  night  traffic  across  central  spaces 
(TAVARES,  2011).  The  population  of  the  city  increased  to  more  than  144,000  by  the  end  of  the  19th 
century,  distributed  over  13.10  km²,  and  already  faced  serious  urban  problems  related  to  unhealthiness 
(NOGUEIRA, 1997). By the end of the 19th century, the landscape of a dirty and ruined city was joined 
with the economic decline of the state of Bahia due to the sugarcane crisis. In that time, the state lost national 
economic  representation  compared  with  the  Center-South  of  Brazil,  which  already  hosted  the  federal 
capital, in Rio de Janeiro, since 1763. The Center-South was demanding labor for coffee plantations and, 
as a local consequence, the demographic and economic growth of Salvador declined (AGUIAR, 1958). 
In the mid-twentieth century, the economic / political situation of the State of Bahia was very fragile. The 
state  remained  relatively  poor,  backward  and  lacking  national  prestige,  despite  its  natural  wealth  and 
historical  importance  for  the  country  (AGUIAR,  1958).  The  economy  derived  from  the  old  colonial 
structure  meant  that  the  state  did  not  collect  enough  taxes  for  government  initiatives  of  the  early  20th 
century. Foreign and domestic borrowing became scarce and the debt picture worsened after the decline in 
cocoa exports in the period post-crisis period of 1929. Finally, the lack of perspective in the countryside, 
which was linked to the concentration of land and semi-labor relations, pushed the migration of thousands 
of families to Salvador, as shown in Figure 2 (TAVARES, 2011).

The demographic disorder of Salvador began with the occupation of Corta-Braço Street by rural migrants. 
After the invasion, the government of Otavio Mangabeira (1947-1951) began to authorize concessions of 
suburban spaces for new residents (TAVARES, 2011). Thus, the so-called Miolo town began to be filled 
by  low-income  population,  through  government  housing  programs  and  spontaneous  occupations.  This 
region,  which  covers  an  area  of  approximately  115  km²,  comprises  the  territories  bordering  Luís  Viana 
Filho  Avenue,  known  as  Paralela  Avenue,  and  BR-324  Highway,  as  shown  in  Figure  3.  The  relatively 
accelerated settlement of this region became more evident from the 1970s onward and was conditioned not 
only by the existence of large territorial voids and the rural exodus from the state’s countryside, but also by 
the new municipal legislation for land use. Law no. 2,181 of 1968 broadened the logic of real estate capital 
in central regions and brought increasing pressure on land use (FERNANDES; REGINA, 2005). 
In the 1970s, the neighborhood of Comércio, which had been the largest commercial center in Salvador 
since the 18th century, permanently lost its status as the “heart” of the city due to the change of social, 
political and economic axis towards the Atlantic coast, more precisely to the region of Iguatemi-Tancredo 
Neves Avenue. The development of the new center happened as a result of the new dynamics of capital 
circulation in the metropolitan region, with the Old Center lacking the infrastructure and space available 
for the expansion required by the new productive structure of the state. The settlement of the New Center 

4 

 

and adjacent neighborhoods, evidenced by residential projects for segments of the upper middle class, was 
directly  linked  to  the  transformations  of  the  city’s  road  system  that  were  carried  from  the  late  1960s 
onwards. These enterprises would later compete with commercial and service companies that migrated to 
the region, further increasing the price of real estate (SANTOS et al., 2010).

After two decades of stagnation, the beginning of the 21st century was characterized by a period of positive 
economic context that contributed to the recovery of a certain dynamism of the past through the expansion 
of commercial activities, services and tourism. In this perspective, the advances made did not avoid the 
serious structural problems of Salvador. The significant growth of the fleet of motor vehicles for the middle 
and upper classes was accompanied by severe diseconomies. This implied a reduction of mobility in the 
main roads of the city, which increased the average time of travel and the proportion of long trips of the 
residence-work type. Moreover, the great reliance on relatively slow public transportation by the workers 
from  the  popular  regions,  which  were  already  scattered  across  the  outskirts  of  the  city,  amplified  the 
distance of most people from the employment centers (DELGADO, 2014). 
This  problem  of  socio-spatial  segregation  was  investigated  by  Silva  (2014)  through  the  composition  of 
residents of Salvador by race. The author reinforces that the black population, which corresponds to about 
4/5 of the inhabitants, are scattered across poor and/or peripheral districts that lack public services and/or 
goods. In contrast, whites accounting for less than a fifth of the population generally occupy the central and 
valued spaces of the municipality. The study uses the terminology of the book Casa Grande & Senzala for 
the analysis of this contradiction, which would be enhanced by the State itself by preferentially serving the 
most privileged segments of the city. Thus, blacks from regions away from the nuclei destined for the white 
population had less possibility of access to employment, education, leisure, etc. 
Population access to employment opportunities is therefore typically unbalanced in Salvador. The disparity 
between density and ethnic patterns coincides with the strong concentration of economic activities within 
the New Center and parts of the Old Center. Such a picture can be explained from the transformations of 
the second half of the 20th century, which spatially segregated the population of the city by income and 
race1. By way of illustration, the distribution of the black/white population regarding the physical distance

ethnic-racial relations were the main factors of social disaggregation.

to some of the centers is available in Figure 4. The relative use of car/bus for workers belonging to the more 
black/white  regions  is  shown  in  Tables  1  and  2.  From  these  numbers,  one  can  see  that  residents  of 
predominantly  white  neighborhoods  not  only  have  geographical  advantages  for  the  physical  movement 
towards some of the  centers, but  also  make the  most emphatic use of the faster mean of transportation: 
private cars.

Given the historical, urban and socio-spatial context of the city, this paper aims to answer the following 
question: what is the effect of accessibility on the pattern of land occupation in the city of Salvador? The 
hypothesis raised is that the unbalanced use of urban space between different segments is explained, at least 
in part, by transportation differentials and physical access to employment opportunities. These differentials 
attribute  distinct  levels  of  attractiveness  to  housing  across  the  territorial  divisions  of  the  city,  although 
selectivity over where to live is restricted to the wealthier families, which are predominantly white. In order 
to  capture  the  vectors  of  employment  distribution  and  the  quality  of  transportation  in  the  municipality, 

6 

 

aggregate accessibility is investigated for two types of motorized transport: the private car and the collective 
bus, with/without congestion. In view of this, this article allows a better understanding of the distribution 
of different population groups in space, whites and blacks, from the relation between population densities 
and accessibility. 
 
3. Urban spatial structure: accessibility and distribution of the population 
 
3.1 Theoretical evolution of urban economics and accessibility to employment 
 
The formal basis for the development of urban models was the classic monocentric model developed by 
Alonso (1964), following the precursory contribution of Von Thünen (1966). The author started from the 
formulation of concentric rings, where the "Isolated State" is replaced by the "Central Business District" 
(or  CBD).  Alonso’s  successors  theoretically  outlined  the  process  of  population  and  firm  concentration 
within the urban environment, in particular Mills (1967) and Muth (1969). Subsequent efforts gave rise to 
non-monocentric general equilibrium models, such as the Fujita and Ogawa (1982) models. These showed 
that the monocentric, non-monocentric or multicentric structure does not necessarily persist when changes 
occur in the switching rate, the level of production and others. 
Fujita  and  Krugman  (1995)  depart  from  a  monopolistic  competition  structure,  with  the  inclusion  of  the 
“location equilibrium condition” and technological factors for the conduct of comparative statics. In the 
model,  the  monocentric  configuration  is  stable  only  if  the  productivity  gains  from  agglomeration  are 
stronger than the transport costs generated by the city’s growth. The dynamic element was introduced in 
modeling by Henderson and Mitra (1996), who explored the phenomenon of suburbanization and analyzed 
the role of urban planning, illustrating the need for an emerging center that complements the old one. By 
introducing the dynamic element into polycentric modeling, the authors show that, between an old center 
and a new center of a metropolis, there develops a kind of competition with effects on the distribution of 
jobs  and  population.  The  geographic  approximation  between  agglomerations  would  imply  productivity 
gains due to spillovers and losses related to  rental and commuting costs for economic agents within the 
edge city. 
Later,  Lucas  and  Rossi-Hansberg  (2002)  developed  the  first  two-dimensional  analyzes  within  the  non-
monocentric approach. The authors broke some of the key assumptions of Fujita and Ogawa (1982), from 
the substitution between land and labor within the production function and the freedom of consumption, 
given the restriction of wealth. The equilibrium of this modeling involves the deduction of a mixed region 
that has commuting costs equal to zero and varies in size according to the existing transport technology. 
Specifically,  this  central  region  grows/decreases  when  worker  switching  becomes  relatively  more/less 
costly.  Such  strategy  allows  the  contextualization  of  internal  competition  to  the  city  in  transformations 
related to transport infrastructure. 
In  the  context  of  the  endogenous  centrality  structure  of  cities,  accessibility  to  employment  can  be 
understood as a concept that expresses the relation between the economic activity of any region and the 
transport infrastructure that serves it (CASCETTA et al., 2013). For Hansen (1959), the more accessible an 
area  is  in  relation  to  the  various  production  activities,  the  greater  its  growth  capacity  and  intensity  of 
development.  In  the  model  of  Fujita  and  Ogawa  (1982),  this  concept  appears  through  the  “locational 
potential” that would be related to the agglomeration forces that favor the concentration of jobs/population. 
Quigley (1985) conceives accessibility as factors of infrastructure that ensure the mobility of the workforce. 
In  general,  greater  accessibility  would  be  linked  to  an  efficient  transport  system,  which  encourages  the 
spatial dispersion of the population and attenuates the negative effects of congestion in central regions. 
The essential idea of accessibility as a determinant of urban form and function is, as a rule, uncontroversial 
in the literature. However, there is no consensus on the specific methodology for measuring accessibility. 

 

7 

Geurs and van Wee (2004) even write that the concept is generally misunderstood, poorly defined, and thus 
poorly  measured  among  policymakers.  The  authors  suggest  that,  for  a  reasonable  estimation  of 
accessibility, a measure should be employed with particular sensitivity to the distribution of jobs/services 
and the specific effect of the traffic network that is available to the population.  
The  original  effort  to  quantify  accessibility  was  derived  from  Newtonian  mechanics,  from  a  potential 
interaction,  or  physical  attraction,  between  origin  and  destination  (CASCETTA  et  al.,  2013).  In 
gravitational  models,  the  attractiveness  factor  within  the  region  under  analysis  generally  refers  to  the 
number  of  jobs  available.  This  factor  is  weighted  by  the  existing  impediment  to  travel,  which  can  be 
expressed by the distance of the course, the switching time or the monetary cost of travel. From Hansen’s 
(1959) gravitational formulation, Ingram (1971) proposed a new measure, called “integral accessibility,” 
that  is,  the  total  number  of  opportunities  attainable  for  each  chosen  source.  This  way  of  estimating 
accessibility has significant advantages of interpretation and communicability, in addition to being able to 
explain the distribution of aggregate population. However, such a metric does not compute variations of 
individual characteristics, and does not contain components of temporal constraints. 
 
3.2 Applications: transport and density 
 
Among the more recent research that has directly investigated the effect of the transport factor on population 
density, Baum-Snow (2007) tested the hypothesis that new transport technologies explain the population 
decline in large American cities from the second half of the 20th century. During this period, there were 
significant governmental actions for the expansion of the interstate highway network, which would grow 
from 341 to 43,420 miles between 1950 and 1990. In order to control the endogeneity resulting from a non-
random distribution of highways, a plan approved in 1947 was used as the instrument, which designated 
the construction of a national road network according to trade and defense criteria. The results indicated 
that the construction of the new mesh contributed to the decline of the aggregate population in central cities.  
Garcia-Lopez  (2012)  investigated  and  extended  Baum-Snow’s  (2007)  conclusions  concerning  spatial 
dispersion/concentration of population. The author focused on the characteristics of rail and road transport 
of the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona, between 1991 and 2006, to show how commuting differentials 
affect  population  density  in  a  European  metropolis.  While  the  rail  system  was  not  physically  modified 
during the period, the region’s highway network grew by 191 km with the construction of 104 new ramps 
between  1991  and  2001,  which  coincided  with  the  ongoing  suburbanization  phenomenon.  Due  to  the 
probable simultaneous determination between the explained variable and the transport factor, it became 
necessary to obtain exogenous variations from ancient Roman roads and important connections of the 19th 
century. The results showed that the transport systems have effect on the density, but the population tends 
to grow only in areas where the development process was previously consolidated. 
Epifani and Nicolini (2017) used a Bayesian approach to analyze the distribution of population density over 
time. Specifically, the study investigated how accessibility to the CBD had influenced population location 
decisions in the state of Massachusetts, USA, between the decades of 1880–90 and 1930–2010. The authors 
adopted a function of probabilistic density where the space in question is assumed as a pole of persistent 
attraction.  In  addition  to  accessibility,  the  authors  identify  the  following  determinants  of  influence  on 
density: ethnic composition of territories, education, age composition, and amenities. Empirical research 
shows  that  the  distance  factor  lost  some  relevance  for  Boston  in  the  post-1960  distribution  function. 
However, the ethnic composition gained remarkable importance over time, which would be linked to the 
discrimination of the real estate market and the formation of urban ghettos from the second half of the 20th 
century.

4. Methodology and data 
 
4.1 Measure of “integral accessibility” 
 
The methodology used to quantify accessibility follows the proposal of Ingram (1971), which counts the 
total  number  of  jobs  attainable  from  an  origin.  This  number  is  weighted  by  the  existing  impediment  to 
travel. The so-called “integral accessibility” was recently calculated by Vieira and Haddad (2012), so that 
the basic model used by the authors is composed of the following equations: 
 

𝑛
𝐴𝑖 = ∑
𝑗=1

𝑤𝑗
𝑑𝑖𝑗

⁡ 

𝑑𝑖𝑗 = 𝑒𝛼∙𝑡𝑖𝑗⁡ 

(01) 

(02) 

where 𝐴𝑖 is the accessibility in territory i, 𝑤𝑗 corresponds to the quantity of jobs available in any territory 
j, while 𝑑𝑖𝑗 is the impediment existing to travel between i and j. This repulsion factor is represented by an 
exponential function composed of the parameter 𝛼 and the average time spent on the way from source i to 
destination j, that is, 𝑡𝑖𝑗. In particular, the value of the parameter 𝛼 is defined from 𝑒𝛼∙𝑡𝑖𝑗 = 2. Thus, a job 
vacancy that does not require switching costs has a weight of 1 in 𝐴𝑖, a weight that falls continuously as 
travel time becomes longer. 
For the study on Salvador, the values of 𝑤𝑗 were extracted from the origin-destination research organized 
by Bahia (2012). The study provides aggregated information on the travel of the resident population, which 
is  spread  across  713  traffic  subzones.  In  this  logic,  residence-restricted  travel-type  matrices  serve  as  a 
measure of available opportunities, since they offer the final destination of the labor force employed in the 
city. 
The average travel time is based on the Google Maps webpage. The collected values refer to the time of 
the best travel trip for a common business day of 2012, assuming that the working day starts at 08:00. The 
references to origin/destination are centroids of the traffic divisions. In view of this, the server allows the 
calculation of the travel impediment function by private (car) and public (bus) transport. 
 
4.2 Econometric modeling 
 
In the context of urban economics, the distribution of population density has been historically measured 
within a monocentric configuration, based on the density value in the central region and physical distance 
from  the  CBD.  On  the  other  hand,  polycentric  investigations  use  the  distance  from  some  subcenter  as 
explanatory  variable.  However,  these  formulations,  as  a  rule,  presuppose  the  homogeneity  of  transport 
infrastructure, which is not empirically reasonable. To evaluate the effect of transport differentials on the 
urban spatial structure, Garcia-Lopez (2012) suggests the following density function: 
 

𝑙𝑛𝐷𝑖𝑡 = 𝐴0 + 𝛾𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑓,𝑖𝑡 + 𝐴1𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 

(03) 

where 𝐷𝑖𝑡 is the population density of area i in time period t, 𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑓,𝑖𝑡 is the distance from subarea i to the 
road  and  subway  infrastructure  of  the  metropolitan  area,  𝛾𝑖𝑛𝑓  is  the  gradient  that  measures  how  much 
density  increases  or  decreases  with  the  distance  from  i  to  the  ramp  road  and  nearest  train  station,  𝑋𝑖𝑡 
corresponds to a set of geographical, historical and location factors that do not change over time, while 𝜀𝑖𝑡 
is the error term. 

 

9 

The  density  model  of  this  work  replaces  the  vectors  of  the  transport  infrastructure  with  physical  access 
variables  or  accessibility  with  congestion.  The  values  of  𝑋𝑖𝑡  take  the  form  of  the  initial  period  of 
urbanization of i, existence or not of beach in i, physical distance of i from some ecological park and from 
some public square. As in Epifani and Nicolini (2015), a variable of ethnic composition will be introduced 
into the density function to control possible factors related to racial segregation in residential regions. The 
high  correlation  between  ethnic  composition  and  socioeconomic  characteristics  for  the  specific  case  of 
Salvador makes it possible to control vectors of income, schooling, etc. 
In the proposed modeling, the density is estimated in natural logarithms by regressions of the reduced form. 
However, the analysis period is restricted to the year 2010 due to the greater availability of data, and it is 
not possible to make a longitudinal analysis. In particular, functions with distance gradients serve didactic 
purposes, while functions with accessibility vectors allow us to capture the effect of transport differentials 
on the access to employment opportunities. 
To estimate the density gradient in relation to the distance from some center, we adopted the procedure of 
Muñiz et al. (2008) to identify the employment poles in the metropolitan region of Salvador, according to 
Figure 5. Specifically, the authors propose a procedure for the determination of employment subcenters, 
which is based on statistical values of: 
 

𝐷𝑖,𝑡 ≥ 𝐷̅𝑅𝑀,𝑡⁡ 

𝐸𝑖,𝑡 ≥ 𝐸𝑅𝑀,𝑡 100⁄

⁡ 

(04) 

(05) 

In the above inequalities, for the time period t, 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 represents the gross employment density in subarea i, 
𝐷̅𝑅𝑀,𝑡 is the mean employment density for the metropolitan region, 𝐸𝑖,𝑡 is the number of job opportunities 
in i, and 𝐸𝑅𝑀,𝑡 refers to the total number of jobs in the region studied. Thus, an urban subarea can only be 
qualified as a subcenter of employment if it has values large enough to simultaneously satisfy inequalities 
(04) and (05).

4.3 Database 
 
A database was elaborated by subdivisions of traffic and it allows to contemplate different aspects about 
the  municipality  of  Salvador.  The  variables  that  constitute  this  bank  are  specified  in  Table  3.  For  the 
aggregate  population  variables,  we  used  microdata  per  census  tract  of  the  Censo  Demográfico  2010, 
produced  by  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics  (IBGE).  The  values  of  accessibility  to 
employment  were  generated  from  origin-destination  matrices  of  the  2012  Mobility  Survey  of  the 
Metropolitan Region of Salvador (Pesquisa de Mobilidade da Região de Metropolitana de Salvador – 2012), 
and traffic projections using Google Maps. The lowest physical distance numbers for some public good 
were generated from geographic coordinates available in Google Maps and centroids of traffic divisions 
provided  by  Bahia  (2012).  In  order  to  identify  the  presence  of  shore  in  analyzed  areas,  the  digital 
cartographic base of Google was again consulted. Finally, the dummy variables referring to the beginning 
of the occupation in  each traffic division  were projected according to  Heinonen’s (2005) map, which is 
available in Figure 1 (B).

4.4 Econometric estimation and empirical strategy 
 
Although transport infrastructure is considered by the literature as a factor that has a long-term effect on 
urban land use, the direction of causality is not very clear. It is possible that a future perspective of density 
or density itself determines a greater/lesser need for public investments in transportation in certain spaces, 
which may have a direct impact on the values of accessibility. Therefore, the identification of the causal 
effect  of  interest  will  be  done  from  a  cross-section  bank  by  city  traffic  divisions,  with  the  respective 
application  of  the  instrumental  variable  estimator  (IV).  As  a  rule,  this  procedure  is  used  for  multiple 
applications, where least-squares estimation  is  compromised due to  the correlation  between explanatory 
variables and the error term. 
In this logic, Baum-Snow (2007) and Garcia-Lopez (2012) seek exogenous variations in old projects or old 
transportation  infrastructures,  which  could  not  be  replicated  for  Salvador.  In  view  of  this,  the  strategy 
proposed in this article is to find geographical factors that precede the distribution of the current population 
and the municipality’s own road network. This strategy was implemented by Haddad and Barufi (2016), 
who make use of distance from the river that gives access to the primitive nucleus of the city of São Paulo 
11 

 

as a tool to investigate the effect of accessibility on income. Specifically, the authors argue that hydrography 
acted as a determinant for the distribution of transport infrastructure, so that the road network has a strong 
spatial correlation with pre-urban watercourses. In addition, the agents are unaware of the existence of large 
rivers and streams in the region, because they are currently decharacterized, which reinforces the exogeneity 
of the instrument. 
Initially, the course of the Camarajipe River,  which is  the largest  river in  Salvador, with  a length  of 14 
kilometers (Figure 6), was chosen as instrument. The river, which was already very important for the supply 
of  water  in  the  city  before  the  mid-20th  century,  is  at  an  advanced  stage  of  pollution  and  exposes  a 
completely  degraded  ecosystem  along  its  banks.  Among  the  natural  tributaries  of  the  Camarajipe,  the 
Lucaia River has its own watershed after its transposition in the 1970s.  The flow of the Lucaia River is 
also compromised because the streambed is quite silted due to human activity. Well-served by avenues and 
important  road  links,  the  divisions  near  Lucaia  have  privileged  access  to  important  points  of  the  city 
(SANTOS et al., 2010).

Thus,  two  instruments  for  accessibility  in  Salvador  were  determined:  (i)  the  shortest  distance  from  the 
Camarajipe  River  or  some  of  its  tributaries  and  (ii)  the  shortest  distance  from  the  Lucaia  River.  The 
statistical and econometric results of the study will be detailed below.

In  the  mobility  research  organized  by  SEINFRA,  the  Soteropolitan  space is  fragmented  into  720  traffic 
subzones, which makes it  possible to gauge accessibility at  a reasonable level  of detail2.  In  general,  the 
analysis in Table 4 suggests that access to employment opportunities is considerably unequal among users 
of different means of motorized transportation. The average value of accessibility without congestion is 
108.3% higher for private transport than for public transport, while the standard deviation is 45.9% higher. 
In the presence of traffic jams, the average accessibility is 72.0% higher for private transportation than for 
public transport, while the standard deviation is 69.5% higher. However, the bus is still the most used mode 
of  motorized  transportation  in  the  city,  including  for  residence-to-work  trips  (68.71%).  This  suggests  a 
dangerous possibility of expansion of the car fleet and/or a poor financial condition of a large part of the 
population, which is forced to use a relatively inefficient means of mobility. 
Figure 7 shows the spatial distribution of accessibility for the classification of traffic subzones. As a rule, 
spaces filled with the darker colors are clustered in central regions of Salvador, except for the CAB, which 
serves  institutional  purposes.  In  the  case  of  private  transport  without  congestion,  in  (A),  there  are  large 
pockets  of  the  highest  class  of  values  covering  regions  and  adjacencies  of  the  Old  Center  and  the  New 
Center. With the congestion factor introduced in (B), there is a greater distribution of intermediate values 
in the macro-region of the Centro, while the distant suburbs continue to cluster relatively low values. In 
distributions  for  public  transport,  (C)  and  (D),  it  can  be  observed  that  these  differ  less  emphatically, 
although the concentration of high values within the Old Center is detachable. 
In  sum,  the  findings  for  Salvador  show  that  private  transportation  always  allows  better  access  to 
employment  in  relation  to  public  transportation.  Once  the  congestion  factor  has  been  introduced,  the 
accessibility values substantially decrease both for private and for public vehicles. It is therefore reasonable 
to assume that the city needs a better mass public transport system, which balances access to employment 
between the different user profiles of the transport system and mitigates the negative effects of congestion. 
 
5.2 Test for the validity of instrumental variables 
 
To estimate the causal effect of transportation differentials and physical access to employment opportunities 
on the distribution of the population in Salvador, it is necessary to identify sources of exogenous variation 
for the explanatory variable. In the presence of simultaneous determination of demographic density and 
accessibility, the Instrumental Variables (IV) method can help to obtain consistent and unbiased estimates 
of the respective causal effect. From this perspective, the following hydrographic instruments were assumed 
to be exogenous: (i) minimum distance from the waters of the Camarajipe River; (ii) minimum distance 
from the Lucaia River. 
The  values  referring  to  rivers  are  taken  as  valid  for  both  accessibility  vectors,  in  classification  of 
agglomerates  of  subzones.  In  light  of  this,  procedures  were  performed  to  capture  the  relevance  of  the 
instruments, qualifying them as strong or weak. Initially, the simple regression of car/bus accessibility over 
the  distance  from  the  Camarajipe/Lucaia  River  was  estimated.  Then,  the  following  covariates  were 
integrated into the equation: ethnic_ comp, urb_1850, urb_1940, urb_1991, dist_park, dist_square, beach. 
Since the accessibility vectors have very strong linear association, the regression of two instruments to an 
endogenous variable was not tested, avoiding problems related to multicollinearity. Table 4 details the test 
numbers for each instrument. 
In  both  instrument  examples,  the  coefficient  of  interest  is  statistically  significant  with  probability  of 
rejection at 1% for each type of regression. For simple regressions, the reduced-form model explains from 
49.14%  to  74.79%  of  the  variation  of  the  explained  variable,  in  this  case,  accessibility.  In  general,  the 
inclusion of new variables in multiple regressions raises the degree of adjustment of modeling, but hardly 
affects  the  coefficient  of  the  instrumental  variable,  which  remains  considerably  strong.  For  practical

purposes, the distance from the Camarajipe River and tributaries will be taken to capture the variation of 
access to employment by private transport, while the Lucaia River variable will be used to estimate some 
exogenous variation referring to commuting by bus.

5.3 Econometric results 
 
Density  regressions  were  performed  for  four  measures  of  physical  access  to  employment:  less  physical 
distance  from  the  CBD,  less  physical  distance  to  any  subcenter  of  employment,  accessibility  to  private 
transportation  and  to  public  transportation.  In  the  occurrence  of  simultaneous  determination  between 
demographic  density  and  accessibility  to  employment,  the  hydrographic  instruments  referring  to  the 
minimum  distance  from  the  Camarajipe  and  Lucaia  rivers  were  used.  The  first  four  equations  were 
estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, while the last two followed the Instrumental 
Variables (IV) method. It is assumed that the IV estimators are consistent and unbiased. 
The estimates of the density regressors are expressed by agglomerates of traffic subzones in Table 6. First, 
the  p-value  of  the  F  statistic  is  null  for  any  model  employed,  which  guarantees  the  joint  statistical 
significance of the explanatory variables. These variables explain from 31.76% to 33.62% of the variation 
related to the dependent variable, according to the determination coefficient R². In general, distance signs 
for  employment  and  accessibility  centers  do  not  contradict  the  theoretical  discussion  developed  earlier. 
Regarding the individual significance of these regressors, almost all of them have statistical validity with 
probability of rejection at 1%, which suggests the importance of the factor of access to employment on the 
distribution of the population within the municipality. 
Comparatively,  the  coefficients  of  accessibility  for  public  transport  have  the  greatest  weight  to  explain 
variations in density of residents per square kilometer. In the model (IV A), it is possible to interpret that 
the decline of 1% in the access to the number of jobs implies a density decrease of 0.71%. For private motor 
vehicles, this effect is relatively lower, 0.43%, and statistically significant with probability rejection at 5%. 
The possible endogeneity for accessibility variables requires the use of instruments, which, when included 
in (V A) and (VI A), capture elasticities of 1.0448 and 1.0224. This suggests that the accessibility effect 
may  be  much  larger  and  more  balanced  between  different  transport  technologies.  Alternatively,  the 
geographical distance from the CBD or from the nearest subcenter of employment should be accompanied 
by the reduction of population density by 5.19% and 6.23%, respectively.

Regarding the other explanatory variables, estimates of ethnic composition suggest that density falls with 
the highest proportion of whites. As whites account for less than 1/5 of the aggregate population and have 
the best levels of schooling and income in the municipality, this factor can capture new components linked 
to segregation, which go beyond the simple definition of race3. Urbanization coefficients have statistical 
significance for 1940 and 1991, capturing the fact that settlement tends to be relatively larger in regions 
already  urbanized  during  the  demographic  pre-explosion  of  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century.  In  this 
perspective, distance from squares suggest that the distribution of public goods may have great relevance 
in  explaining  the  current  density  of  the  city.  However,  the  distance  from  ecological  parks  has  very  low 
coefficients and no statistical significance. Finally, the beach dummy variable has statistical significance at 
the 5% level and points out that the settlement in coastal divisions tends to be relatively smaller. This makes 
sense when considering the existence of specific norms for the densification and verticalization of these 
spaces, expressed in templates of height of buildings.

3 The coefficient of correlation referring to the ethnic composition and average income of the household (in log) is very strong: 
0.9315. On the other hand, the degree of linear association obtained through the relation between ethnic composition and average 
schooling of the head of the household is 0.9093. The new data have as primary source the aggregates by census sectors of the 
Censo Demográfico (2010 and 2000), produced by IBGE.

Table 7 shows the values for the white density regressions for the city of Salvador. In any estimated model, 
the p-value of the F statistic remains null, which implies the statistical significance of the set of explanatory 
variables. The values of the coefficient of determination R² now range from 0.3339 to 0.3490, which differs 
little for the example with the total population. As a rule, the estimated coefficients have equal signs and 
values similar to those previously discussed, except for the ethnic composition variable. In this case, the 
greater  proportion  of  whites  probably  implies  a  greater  number  of  whites  per  km²,  which  at  first  seems 
rhetorical. However, the linear association between the variables is negligible (0.26), thus reinforcing the 
importance of the regressor previously employed in Epifani and Nicolini (2015). 
For the accessibility research, the records in Table 7 are that the positive variation of 1% of the indicator 
for private motor vehicles should be accompanied by the highest population of whites per km² by 0.48%. 
This effect remains low when compared to the collective transport indicator: 0.78%. This can perhaps be 
explained  by  the  fact  that  the  number  of  jobs  attainable  has  already  been  markedly  higher  for  private 
transport, with or without congestion. Another justification for the estimates refers to the very restriction 
of the cumulative opportunity indicator, which does not allow to capture individual preferences or even to 
differentiate  between  the  different  types  of  employment.  However,  it  is  possible  that  the  parameters 
themselves are biased due to the simultaneous determination of accessibility and density. The numerical 
discrepancy  between  indicator  and  instrument  coefficients  in  both  transport  technologies  reinforces  this 
possibility.

The  same  density  models  were  estimated  considering  only  the  black  population,  according  to  Table  8. 
Again, the p-value of the F statistic is null for any form of estimation, thus determining the significance of 
the set of regressors. The values of the coefficient of determination R² vary from 0.3971 to 0.4132, thus 
suggesting that the modeling employed explains better the settlement of blacks in relation to the population 
of whites per km². In the estimations (I C) and (II C), the density decreases with the physical distance of 1 
km  from  the  employment  centers  follow  the  percentage  values  of  5.25%  and  6.33%,  respectively.  This 
decline in instrumental variables is 1.04% for the decrease of 1% in the accessibility indicator, whether for 

17 

 

private or public transportation. In particular, the ethnic component variable has coefficient between -3.85 
and -4.04 for the density of blacks, values that were between -2.24 to -2.44 for the integral density. This 
suggests that there is in fact racial segregation in residential areas of Salvador, which is possibly linked to 
real estate speculation and the formation of ghettos in poor or peripheral neighborhoods. 
In  general  terms,  the  parameters  estimated  to  measure  the  effect  of  transport  differentials  and  physical 
access  to  employment  opportunities  are  valid  at  acceptable  levels  of  significance,  regardless  of  the 
dependent variable employed. Therefore, comprehensive accessibility measures explain at least in part the 
distribution of different population groups in the city of Salvador. Thus, a smaller physical distance from 
the dynamic nuclei of the city or a smaller possibility of reaching a certain variety of jobs should justify a 
lower demand for housing and concentration of people in more distant peripheral spaces.

6. Final considerations 
 
This study aimed to analyze the effect of accessibility on the patterns of population location in the city of 
Salvador. In particular, it also sought to investigate the spatial distribution of whites and blacks in this city, 
based  on  the  relationship  between  densities  and  accessibility,  in  a  polycentric  spatial  configuration  in 
relation to the location of jobs. The hypothesis raised was that the unbalanced use of urban space between 
different segments of the population is explained, in part, by transportation differentials and physical access 
to employment opportunities. These differentials attribute different levels of housing attractiveness to the 
territorial divisions of the city, although selectivity over where to live is restricted to the wealthier families, 
which are predominantly white. 
The integral accessibility index allowed us to capture the vectors of employment distribution and quality 
of transportation in Salvador. This indicator, by car/bus without/with congestion, provided the number of 
attainable employment opportunities for each traffic division of the city. Thus, it was possible to affirm that 
physical access to employment is considerably unequal among users of motorized means of transportation. 
When considering traffic congestion, the index was substantially decreased for any form of transportation. 
18 

 

This  reinforces  that  the  city  needs  a  better  public  transportation  system,  which  balances  access  to 
employment between different user profiles and mitigates the negative effects of congestion. 
The  identification  strategy  based  on  the  use  of  hydrographic  instruments  to  isolate  the  causal  effect  of 
accessibility  on  density  presented  important  results.  For  each  validity  test,  the  instrument  coefficient  is 
statistically significant with probability of rejection at 1%. As a rule, the final estimates suggested that the 
factors of access to employment had a positive effect, and statistically significant on the population density 
of the city. With regard to the other variables, we highlight the ethnic composition control, which captures 
components linked to racial segregation. This control had opposite signs for distinct population groups, but 
its effect on black density was markedly higher. On the other hand, the population per km² was higher in 
regions already filled during the demographic pre-explosion of the second half of the 20th century. 
The analysis of the results by race segment showed that the estimated parameters presented similar signs 
and values similar to those found for the general  population. The ethnic composition variable showed a 
higher number of whites and a lower number of blacks per km², as the proportion of whites in the local 
population is higher. This observation has some importance due to the cited variable having a very strong 
correlation  with  income  and  average  schooling,  which  were  not  included  directly  in  the  regressions.  In 
general terms, the coefficients for the population density accessibility effect showed that a lower possibility 
of reaching jobs should justify a lower demand for housing in more distant peripheral spaces. This applies 
to blacks and whites regardless of the technology of transportation, car or bus. 
This work allowed a better understanding of the distribution of different population groups in space, whites 
and  blacks,  from  the  relation  between  population  density  and  accessibility.  The  findings  are  potentially 
useful by providing new information and figures on the level of access to job opportunities among different 
population  groups  in  the  municipality.  However,  due  to  the  non-availability  of  data,  the  analysis  was 
restricted to a single period of time, which does not make it possible to evaluate the effect of any specific 
policy. In the same logic, it will be necessary to expand the object of study for the other municipalities of 
the metropolitan region. These municipalities jointly account for 20.9% of the workforce and 24.4% of the 
metropolitan area jobs. For future extensions, it will be important to investigate the feasibility of the full 
accessibility index itself, capture individual preferences or qualify the different types of employment.
