Technological Gap, Demand Lag And TradePaulo Ricardo S. Oliveira José Maria F.J. da SilveiraDavid S. Bullock AbstractThe relationship between innovation and trade has been largely seen from the perspective technological gaps and market share advantages for innovative countries. However, this straightforward relationship may not hold in face of certain level of “technology hatred” – as in the case of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). As national regulatory frameworks were built upon unilateral basis, many conflicts emerged opening a room for considering backward effects of technology innovation on trade. Based on firm heterogeneity and evolutionary economics literature the central aim of this paper is to investigate the role of technological gap and demand lag on trade, in the context of certain level of technology “hatred”. The technological gap is the difference or technological distance of techniques employed by late-movers when compared with technology used by leaders. Likewise, the demand lag may be understood as the difference or technological distance of techniques employed by producers in exporting countries and the level of acceptance or compatibility in destination markets. By means of a gravity equation we empirically estimated these effects on bilateral trade flows of soybeans. The results show that both technological gap and demand lag had important impacts on bilateral trade of soybeans from 1995 to 2012.

Entretanto, esta relação direta pode não ocorrer quando existe certo nível de rejeição tecnológica – como foi o caso dos organismos geneticamente modificados (OGMs). Como os quadros regulatórios foram elaborados de forma unilateral, muitos conflitos se estabeleceram abrindo espaço para se considerar a existência de efeitos tecnológicos adversos no comércio. Baseado na literatura dos modelos da heterogeneidade da firma e na economia evolucionária, o objetivo central deste artigo é investigar o papel do hiato tecnológico e da rejeição de demanda no comércio. O hiato tecnológico é a diferença ou distância tecnológica entre os países atrasados e os líderes. Analogamente, o hiato/rejeição da demanda é a diferença ou distância entre as preferências tecnológicas dos exportadores e importadores. Por meio de um modelo gravitacional estes efeitos foram estimados empiricamente com bases em dados de comércio da soja em grão. Os resultados confirmam que tanto o hiato tecnológico quanto o hiato da demanda impactaram de maneira significativa os fluxos comercias entre 1995 e 2012.

Introduction It has been commonly accepted that technology innovations have positive impacts on exports since it improves production efficiency of innovative countries. However, when a particular technology is somehow rejected by part of international markets this expected effect can be counterbalanced or even overwhelmed by the negative effect of technology hatred. This is not a completely new idea. Posner (1961) had already pointed to very similar insights in the relation of technology change and trade. But this subject has been largely neglect as technology has been always assumed as a good from the consumer perspective. In this way, the trade on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is a good example of how backward technology effects can take place. GMOs have been produced and exported since 1996. The technology became rapidly available to producing countries via trade in technology headed by large multinational seed companies all over the world. But, some important consuming markets have been skeptical about the benefits of the production and consumption of genetically modified food, concerning mainly about high health, environmental and economic potential risks. Mainly because of some market characteristics and data availability the case of genetically modified soybean is a unique experiment to explorer most of the technological impacts we are dealing with.  Together, Brazil, United States and Argentina accounts for 87% of world exports of soybeans, and the EU and China accounts for more than 83% of world imports. While growers in United States and Argentina have been cultivating GM seeds since 1996, it took almost a decade to cultivation be approved in Brazil. Many European countries, however, have been noted contrary to the use of GM seeds in agriculture, encouraging the raising of trade barriers or even banning importation of food or contents deriving from GMOs. On the other hand, in China, although the few limitations to free trade of GM products, no rules preventing the country of being a certain destination for GMOs has passed. The absence of multilateral bodies powerful enough to enforce a compromise between major players open a room for country-level regulations of approval, coexistence, labeling, and other issues related to GMOs production and trade. As expected, technology turns out to be a new source of trade conflicts lasting until today, as pointed by many applied studies dealing with this puzzle. The aim of this paper is to evaluate how technical change impacted bilateral trade in the presence of unequal technology adoption and significant levels of technology hatred. Our central hypothesis is that under these circumstances technological innovation leads to a two-fold effect in trade – the technology-gap and the demand-lag. The technology gap can be seen as how advanced or efficient a country technology is in comparison with cutting-edge technologies globally available. The demand lag, instead, is how accepted a country technology is in destination markets in a point of time. These concepts are very insightful to the purposes of this study. They were discussed firstly by Posner (1961), but have been neglected in the new developments of trade theory, partially because of the lack of cases in which these two effects played such clear and opposing roles on trade.  As innovation combined with different tastes will increase firm heterogeneity in technological terms, we departed from the general framework by Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008) – hereinafter referred simply as HMR – to investigate the technology gap and the demand lag.Noteworthy, the increasingly complexity of new technologies – which not rarely brings cultural and ethical issues into the social approval –, consumers’ increased access to information make this case not a unique of his kind. It is important to note that uncertainty about risks and cultural-based judgments will be always an argument for restrictive unilateral regulations. The growing concern about more social, economic and environmental sustainable production methods is already a reality as one can see through fair trade initiatives, for instance, which establish principles for work contracts and use of particular inputs in agricultural production.  This study contributes to current literature mainly by raising issues about the role of consumer preferences, and the impact of technical progress on trade. We also advance by estimating the effects of demand lag and technology gap simultaneously – as much of the applied works on the field of GMOs consider only the impacts of commercial risks, or demand lag in our jargon. The combination of technology-gap theories and firm heterogeneity models is innovative as far as we know. A better understanding of this matter is needed since changes in technology with backward effects in trade will lead to unequal gains and losses across countries and actors. This paper is divided into 4 remaining sections besides this introduction. Section 2 brings forward the literature review. Section 3 introduces the methodology. Section 4 brings out the results. Finally, section 5 concludes the paper. 2. Literature ReviewTechnology has been considered a source of comparative advantage under the Ricardian model of trade in opposition to the Heckscher-Ohlin model, which considers differences in endowment as the major driver of trade. However, Ricardian models of trade usually consider an unchangeable level of technology determining specialization and gains of trade. Perfect competition, absence of trade barriers, homothetic preferences and in some cases geography will create a world with certain degree of specialization and the only way of trading technology is through the trade of goods comprising such technologies. Firms can differ in terms of technology, but perfect competition wipes out effects of any love for variety (Dornbusch, Fischer e Samuelson, 1977; Eaton e Kortum, 2002). The ideas of technology-gap are mostly related to evolutionary economics as it brings the idea of technical change as the driver of economic change. In general, an innovation in a particular country will result in increased efficiency and gains of market-share. On the other hand, other comparative advantages such as the costs of non-technological factors can counterbalance technological advantages. The speed of the diffusion rate is also central to think impacts of a particular innovation on trade. In some cases the time elapsed between an innovation and its critical adoption point can be delayed by slow market acceptance of a new technology (Dosi, Grazzi e Moschella, 2015; Dosi, Pavitt e Soete, 1990; Dosi e Soete, 1988; Maggi, 1993; Posner, 1961).Firm heterogeneity models have been raising and discussing a number of interesting questions about trade by going deeper into firms instead of thinking country-level characteristics. Under monopolistic competition, homothetic preferences and love for variety is possible to think trade impacts related to different firms’ efficiencies and product and process innovation as consumers will always see a product of an innovation as a new one. Fixed and variable costs of trade allow the considering of increasing returns to scale in specialization(Helpman, Melitz e Rubestein, 2008; Melitz, 2003). Regarding the case study, Oliveira et al. (2012)  point out that competitiveness effect, measured as the amount of variation in exports not explained by increases in destination market absorption or world’s exports increase, brings out some interesting patterns between 1995 and 2012. Brazilian exports increases by competitiveness effect while US decreases when Brazil was considered GM-free and US have achieved high adoption levels – competitiveness can explain up to 60% of Brazilian exports of soybeans in 2000/2002 and -389% of US. However, the competiveness effect will change in favor of U.S. after 2005, when Brazil also adopts the technology – U.S.  (31%) and negative to both Brazil (-39%) and Argentina (-47%).Vigani et al. (2012) performed a gravity model to analyze the impact of technology on bilateral trade in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The gravity variable was the gap between the regulatory frameworks of trade partners measured by an index estimated by the authors. Noteworthy, in agriculture, in particular, authors usually consider regulatory differences as non-tariff barriers (NTB) increasing trade costs for most dissimilar partners (Burnquist et al., 2011; Vigani e Olper, 2013; Winchester et al., 2012). The magnitude of the estimated coefficient – in Vigani et al (2012) implies that one standard deviation decrease in the GMO dissimilarity index (=0.188) increases exports by 33%, all else remaining equal.Through a more complete and time-varying restrictiveness index for 2000, 2009 and 2012 it is possible to see that restrictiveness is larger in European countries and South America, and lower for U.S. (Faria e Wieck, 2015). Besides, this study points out to significant impacts of dissimilarity on trade. The index take into account not only biosafety regulatory dissimilarity but also the gap between approved varieties.Disdie & Fontagné (2010), in turn, studied the impact of the EU de facto moratorium and bans of other European countries on the exports of complainants (Canada, Argentina and US) and non-complainants in the WTO dispute from 1995-2005. They conclude that EU measures on GMOs reduced Argentina, Canada and US exports of maize seeds by 89.4% on average. Regarding national bans, it appears that only the Austrian ones on maize (seeds and other) and the Italian one on maize seeds do not have a significant impact. All other national safeguard measures affected Argentinean, Canadian and US exports. Noteworthy, recent studies show that policymakers from different member states have kept their positions regarding the technology by voting in a favor or against new approvals in a steady way (Smart, Blum e Wesseler, 2015). Anderson & Jackson (2004), by using a GTAP model with neoclassical closure, pointed out that since 1998 when the EU implemented the moratorium, GM adopting countries have lost EU market shares to GM free suppliers, particularly Brazil for maize and soybean and Australia and Central Europe for rapeseed. On the other hand, there are evidences that Canada’s rapeseed and US corn sales to the EU were successfully shifted to other markets. This shift to less adverse markets seems to be the case of soybean markets when we consider the replacement of U.S. by Brazilian Exports in the second half of 1990s, along with growing imports of China (see also Smyth, Kerr e Davey, 2006; Stein e Rodriguez-Cerezo, 2009). In terms of benefits of planting GMOs there are many studies corroborating economic gains ( see Bärwald Bohm et al., 2014; Brookes & Barfoot, 2014; Chavas, Shi, & Lauer, 2014; Qaim & Zilberman, 2003; Sturges et al., 2003). Authors usually point to less expansive and easy control of weed, higher yields and reduction of adoption of tillage systems. Yield gains are the most questionable benefit being possible to find evidences of negligible or negative effects of technology. However, many studies points to higher yields especially for developing countries in which prior pest controls were poor (Qaim e Zilberman, 2003).  A recent studied estimated that economic gains reached 116.6 billion of USD from 1996 to 2012. For the soybean case, there was a cut down in production costs, mainly through reduced expenditure on weed control (herbicides). In South America, additionally, there were gains associated with the adoption of no tillage production systems, shortening the production cycle, so enabling famers rip benefits of growing a second crop in the interval of two seasons. They estimate that gains for farm incomes amounted 4.8 billions in 2012 (Brookes e Barfoot, 2014). It is important to note that technology costs vary across countries and so cost savings also differ. In Argentina technology costs vary from 2-4 dollars per hectare, whereas in Brazil it is 11-25 and in US 15-39. Yield gains are more likely to be seen in Brazil and Argentina where insect resistant varieties improved considerably pest control (Bärwald Bohm et al., 2014; Brookes e Barfoot, 2014). In sum, literature shows that, on the one hand, we have major producing and exporting countries regulating technology in different ways and, so altering the market forces of international technological diffusion. On the other hand, we have major importers taking different regulatory positions towards this same technology. In addition, consumers all over the word will have different views towards the consumption of products deriving from GMOs. The combination of this initial scenario will become a unique experiment for studying the interactions of technical change and trade. Overall, a set of empirical and theoretical analysis has been pointing to negative effects of regulatory heterogeneity on trade – mainly through asynchronous approval, mandatory labeling and LLP of unauthorized event. However, empirical analyses have often not considered the effects of technological gap on trade, and this effect is important once not all markets developed levels of hatred against the GMOs technology. It is the same of saying that for each approval of a new variety, countries are facing not only a commercial risk but also an opportunity costs defined as the distance a country is taken from the most innovative markets. 	3. MethodIn this particular study, we estimate a gravity equation to analyze trade of one-product and breakdown technology change effects into technological gap and demand lag in the presence of heterogeneous firms and asymmetrical approval of the new technology. These objectives created three estimation related challenges. First, we cannot resort to the convenience of using country fixed effects, as it would hamper the estimation of the technological gap, which is a country-level variable. So we have used country  production and country  consumption of these commodities to control for size. This procedure is not only recommended but also desired when working with industrial data (Head e Mayer, 2013). The advantage of this procedure is to avoid the problems of aggregation bias, getting more straightforward coefficients in terms of interpretation. By not using country’s fixed effects the control for Multilateral Resistance of Trade (MTR) become central to avoid the so called golden medal mistake of gravity equation (Anderson e Wincoop, 2003; WTO e UNCTAD, 2012). We have used the remoteness index as described by Head e Mayer (2013). Second, when considering a small continuum of goods the number of non-positive trade flows increase considerably creating difficulties to estimating the log-linear form of the model.  Simply cutting out zero-valued flows from the sample is not the best solution since it can potentially create a problem of strong sample selection bias. Yet, zeroes can be meaningful in some situations as when impeditive fixed costs are playing a role in the chance of a country  exporting to country  – what may occur in our case if levels of “hatred” are big enough to cripple some trade flows. Econometric tests show that censored or truncated regressions and replacement of zeroes with arbitrary numbers are biased and also not preferred to two-stage selection models (Linders e Groot, De, 2006). Thus, we have employed an adapted Heckman (1979) two-stage model to correct for sample bias, as presented by the influential paper by Helpman, Melits and Rubinstein (2008), which also controls for firm heterogeneity by assuming monopolistic competition. Third, technology gap and the demand lag will change over time, and will impact differently on trade for each year . HMR (2008) developed a complete model to assess cross-sectional or pooled data. But the calculation of controls for firm heterogeneity and selection bias are not ready to go with panel data analysis. Several papers attempted to provide a final solution for Heckman type correction in panel-data, but until today there is no optimal solving for this puzzle (Charbonneau, 2014; Gómez-Herrera, 2012; Martínez-zarzoso, Vidovic e Voicu, 2014). Thus, we decided to estimate HMR controls for firm heterogeneity and sample selection bias as in Martínez-zarzoso, Vidovic, & Voicu (2014). In addition, supported by further statistical tests, we also estimated a Fixed Effect Model on the same panel-data. Our final models can account for the potential problems of sample selection, omitted firm heterogeneity effects and dynamic effects of technology change predicted by Posner (1961). In addition we could also include variables to test for other interesting effects, such as the technology state (Eaton and Kortum 2002) – measured by the countries’ average productivity – and differences in land availability, since factor endowments can be a significant source of trade in agricultural goods. Departing from HMR (2008) and taking into account our objectives and estimation strategy we adjusted the model for: where, we directly control for country consumption  and variables impacting on price index or remoteness , for country  outcome  ) and production costs variables . The control  is defined as in HMR (2008) except for the fact we are controlling firms’ fraction for each period , explicitly assuming that the number of exporting firms can change over time. Note that with this formulation we can compute the technological gap as a country  specific-cost affecting the overall production costs. The demand lag, in turn, will be computed as a type of variable cost of trade, making  change over the time. As in HMR  (2008), our first-stage consists of estimating a Probit model to calculate both the sample selection and the firm heterogeneity controls to be added into the gravity equation at the second-stage. In addition to returning the controls for firm heterogeneity and sample bias, by the means of the Probit model we can breakdown the effects in trade into extensive and intensive margins. Thus firms’ productivity differs within countries in an interval , in which  is the most productive and  the least productive firm. Assume that productivities range can be represented by a Pareto distribution . Though, only a share of firms, those with productivity high enough to serve country  and breakeven fixed costs of trade, will export. The selection of firms into exporting markets is determined by a cutoff , which is implicitly defined by the zero profit condition. Let  be the probability that  exports to , conditional on the observed variables. Thus we can specify the Probit model aswhere  is the cdf of the unit-normal distribution. According to HMR (2008) this selection equation has been derived from a firm level decision, and it therefore does not contain the unobserved and endogenous variable  that is related to the fraction of exporting firms. Moreover, the Probit can be used to derive consistent estimates of According to our assumptions, consistent estimation of the log-linear model requires control for both the endogenous number of exporters (via ) and the selection of country pairs into trading partners (which generates a correlation between the unobserved  and the dependent variables). Thus, estimates for  and  are needed. Additionally, . As  has a unit normal distribution, the inverse Mills ratio, as in Heckman (1979) seminal paper, is thus a consistent estimation of . Therefore, is a consistent estimate for  and is a consistent estimate for  . Thus the model can be estimate using the transformationwhere  and  is an i.i.d error term satisfying . Note that equation (5) is nonlinear in . However, a linear model can be estimated. Following specifications in HMR(2008) we dropped the Pareto assumption  and revert it to the general specification for . Thus,  is now an arbitrary and increasing function of . Then, it’s possible to control for  using approximated with a polynomial in  replacing  in the equation at the second-stage. Accordingly, our final estimate equation will be As the estimation of the controls for sample selection and firm heterogeneity are not straightforward for panel data, there is a solution proposed by Wooldridge (1995, p.121-130) which makes use of a Chamberlain-Mundlak approach (see works by Egger et al (2009); Egger and Pfaffermayr (2011)). Neither  nor  coefficients are significant in the pooled data model, meaning that estimate via FE model on panel data is consistent. Our FE model has as individuals the country-pairs and time dimension from 1996 to 2012. Taking country-pairs as ids is very common in the literature (Baltagi, Egger e Pfaffermayr, 2014; Gómez-Herrera, 2012).  An F test for FE model and OLS, with the null hypothesis of non-significant effect of heterogeneity across individuals, returned a p-value < 2.2e-16. A Houseman test with the null hypothesis of non-correlation between unique errors and predictors, we get a p-value =1.914e-13. Thus, the Random Effect model is inconsistent (see Green, 2008, chapter 9). A Lagrange Multiplier Test (Breusch-Pagan), with null hypothesis of no need for fixed time effect, pointed to the need for including time fixed effect in our FE model (p-value< 2.2e-16). Regarding model fitness, we tested for serial correlation, heteroskedasticity, and multi-collinearity. Breusch-Godfrey/Woodridge test don’t allow us to reject the hypothesis for serial correlation (p-value = 5.117e-08). Also, the Breusch-Pagan test for panel data revealed the problem of heteroskedasticity (p-value < 2.2e-16). We treat both problems with “arellano” correction in R cran according to White method (Arellano, 1987; White, 1980). All tests and models were run in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (R Cran) making use of plm, glm, sandwich, lmtest, sampleSelection, car and tseries. Data Data on soybean trade comes from BACI database developed by CEPII at a high level of product disaggregation (for detailed information see Guillaume & Zignago, 2010). General gravity data – distance, colonial ties, common language, contiguous or landlocked territories, among others, are from GeoDist database also by CEPII (for detailed information see Mayer & Zignago, 2011). Agricultural related data, such as production, average yield, arable-land and others were collected from the FAOSTAT database. Data on exchange rates comes from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and prices data from World Bank Commodity Price Data (The Pink Sheet).Country-level data on biosafety used to build our technological variables comes from different sources. Data on approval of genetically modified varieties comes mainly from International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) database. However, when needed – because of missing or incomplete information – data was fulfilled by information from Global Agricultural Information Network (GAINS) report by the Foreign Agricultural Service of the USDA (FAS-USDA) and data from Biosafety-Clearing House (BCH) databases. The final database used for the estimation of the Probit model contained 39,751 observations for 16 years, 42 variables and 84 countries. From those, only 6,634 observations had positive trade flows. The significant reduction of the database calls for a correct assess of sample selection bias to assure that estimates are consistent. However, as we have seen in 3.1, according to Wooldridge (1995) test, estimating a FE model is consistent without these controls. However, these controls enter the HMR (2008) model via the specification of the theoretical model. The final database for panel estimates has 6,634 observations (id=country-pairs) and 44 variables, containing trade flows of soybean between 1995 and 2012 for 84 countries. In Box 1, in appendix, we briefly introduce the variables actually used in the models.Technological Variables General approach to create the variable Demand lag consisted of three steps. First, we gathered data on approvals for cultivation, food and feed for all the varieties of soybean available, as reported in ISAAA database. Second, for each  and variety we created a dummy variable assuming value 1 when country  has approved a variety for cultivation not approved for consumption as food, feed or both in country . Third, we aggregated the values of dummy variables per year to have the total of demand lag for each pair of countries in year .Further steps were necessary to solve the problem of including countries with “zero” approved varieties into the model. We know that many countries haven’t implemented regulatory frameworks, or have no assessment capacity to carry out tests for identification of imports of unauthorized events. On the other hand, we also know that some countries banned importation of all GMOs. A related problem emerges when a country implements risk assessments measures after 1996 – the first year of commercial release of GMOs. Therefore, we analyzed all zero approvals case-by-case to determine if the value of total events approved for each year should be ascribed, or zero approval actually means a ban. Underlying information to discriminate between these two types of zero came from GAINS reports, but also from BCH archives and the Africa Centre for Biosafety report (Moola & Munnik, 2007; BCH, 2015; FAS, 2015). As bans to GMOs were usually of public concerns and well disseminated across specialist and media, we created a dummy for bans to correct for false zero approvals . If a ban were reported by one of the data sources for a specific , so the dummy variable was set to 1. Otherwise, if no ban was reported, the dummy is set to 0. By multiplying both we get the adjusted asymmetry between  and  in terms of approved varieties – i.e. (.In the case of Tech. Gap we took a more pragmatic approach. We simply found the total number of different varieties available and approved for production in at least one country  for a given  and subtracted the number of approved varieties in particular country  to have a “distance” between country varieties and the state of the art of technology. That was possible because major producing countries have taken very clear legal positions towards the technology since the early-1990s. It’s worth noting that we haven’t used logarithm transformation to these variables, as they are derived of dummy variables. Results and Discussion  Results can be seen in Table 1 and 2, in appendix. As tests indicate the consistence of FE models we are setting this model (7) as our benchmark – hereinafter FE (7). But we are also considering results from HMR-I (column 3) along with the Probit results (column 1) – hereinafter HMR-I (3). HMR-I (3) is interesting to discuss the effects on the intensive and extensive margins of trade, as well as the impacts of firm heterogeneity. Sample Selection and Firm Heterogeneity BiasesAs expected, the controls for firm heterogeneity and selection bias play a role only in the HMR-I (3). Firm heterogeneity is related to prohibitive fixed costs leading to the lack of trade between country pairs. This latter effect is important since we are assuming that the adoption of GM technology by Argentina and the US along with non-adoption by Brazil from 1996-2005 may have caused changes in the extensive and intensive margin of trade. A comparison between models in columns (2) and (3) in table 2 provides a picture about the general impact the proposed controls have on the coefficients. The absence of controls will make some coefficients have an upward bias. Overall, variables controlling for sizes, country remoteness and bilateral trade costs returned upward biased coefficients, whereas country ’s remoteness is downward. Interestingly, coefficients with higher importance for extensive margin of trade not only return downward biases but also became significant after the controls introduction (see coefficients for Language, Same Country, and RTA in columns (1) to (3) in table 2).  Results are consistent with HMR (2008), where the firm heterogeneity overcomes the effects of selection bias. Also, the coefficients are positive, meaning that countries with higher proportion of exporting firms and unobserved characteristic of countries determining positive trade flows will also positively impact on trade volumes.Note that none of the controls are significant in FE (7). Comparing model HMR-I (3) with FE (7) we can see that some coefficients will return greater and others smaller coefficients. However, remoteness and exchange rate of exporters and common language will be statistically insignificant in (7) but significant in (3). Impacts of country-level variables From the supply side, based on theory and studies on aggregated data, we can expect that soybean trade will increase along with higher outcomes of soybean and average yields of exports. Conversely, trade volumes tend to be decreased by higher exchange rates, lack of maritime exits and remoteness. Production and yield returned the expected impact on trade flows as we can see in columns (3) and (7) in 2. Given the production elasticity of trade reported in FE (3), for each increase of say, 10%, in production, trade will increase by 3.8%. Trade elasticity of production is not higher because of internal consumption of soybean in major producing countries (e.g. China) and some of the larger exporters produce small quantities of soybean (eg. the Netherlands). Note that production also impacts the probability of exporting, but the relevant impact will be at the intensive margin of trade. Exporter with higher average yields, which can be seen as a result of technologies available at the country level, also increases the volume of trade significantly. An increase in average productivity level of 10 % makes exports increase by 11.4%. The parameter in  in Eaton and Kortum (2002) model, representing the general level of technology in a country can be a theoretical explanation for the high yield elasticity of exports.  Paradoxically, landlocked exporters tend to export considerably higher volumes when compared to countries with maritime access. However, this effect has a negative impact on the extensive margin of trade, indicating that landlocked country has on average less trade connections than others. A closer look at the data shows that this seeming odd result is valid only for the soybean case, given intra-bloc trade in European Union and significant shares of world exports of landlocked countries like Paraguay, Switzerland, Bolivia, Zambia, Austria and Hungary. Remoteness and variations of the exchange rate in exporting countries aren’t significant in FE (7), and have very small values in HMR-I (3) models. This result is explained by the concentrated international supply of soybeans – primarily in the Americas. Variations in exchange rate in exporting countries are expected to impact trade in two different ways. On the one hand it makes soybean export prices in countries with devaluated currency cheaper. On the other hand, it makes the inputs used in production more expensive. Some studies show that currency devaluations in South America displace exports of the US in international markets (Andino e Koo, 2005). However, our results show that impacts on the likelihood of exports are possibly very low and positive (0.08%), meaning that currency valuation in country  increases the likelihood of positive trade flows, marginally. Regarding the intensive margin of trade, HMR-I (3) returned an elasticity of 0.082 for this variable. It can be a result of the predominance of increases of imported inputs relative prices as well as an indication of the weakness of this variable to explain bilateral trade of soybeans as the international prices are always given in USD dollars regardless variation of international currencies. From the demand side, theory predicts that bilateral trade tends to increase along with higher demand levels, valuated exchange rates, absence or high imperfectness of substitute goods, easy access to the sea and low levels of remoteness. Results show that one increase of 10% in consumption, will lead to an increase of 3% of imports. This number isn’t higher because larger consuming markets also produce certain amounts of soybean, with the obvious exception of the EU. The effect of substitutes goods (Other Goods i) shows that soybean has not a close substitute for meal production in international markets. For each increase of 10% in imports of other meals feedstock, such as meat and bone meals, fishmeal, among others, imports of soybean increase by 2.12% on average. HMR-I (3) returns coefficients with the same sign and significance but with smaller values. Importing countries with high degrees of remoteness, devaluated currencies and landlocked will actually import less volumes of soybean. Landlocked countries import on average 60% less when compared to countries with maritime access. Currency devaluations and increases in the remoteness index have smaller impacts, but considering the magnitude of small percentages applied on huge amounts of soybean traded, the economic significance can be considerable in some cases. HMR-I (3) shows similar impacts in terms of sign, magnitude and significance of coefficients. Noteworthy, landlocked country tends to have more positive trade inflows when compared to others, accordingly to results of model (1).In sum, we can say size and state of technology in producing countries are the key drivers of exports volume. On the demand side, size, remoteness, valuated currencies and access to maritime routes are the most important drivers of trade inflows. In addition, the lack of international close substitutes for soybean will also play a role in determining demand. Impact of trade-level variables First, it is important to note that common language is not significant according to our benchmark model FE (7). On the other hand, this variable is highly significant in the HMR-I (3) model. Thinking of Brazil, Argentina and United States, it is difficult to think about a determined effect as the number of countries speaking Portuguese will be reduced – as well as their economic importance. This and other qualifications peculiar to our case, such as the importance of China as a consumer market, and absence of a larger producer speaking Chinese, will make the analysis of language effect ambiguous. Countries having colonial ties trade approx. 158% more when compared to others. On the other hand, countries sharing a same colonist for long periods will trade reduced volumes of soybean (46.5% approx.). It can be a result of agricultural specialization of colonies, making the trade of agricultural products smaller between two agricultural-based countries, but intense between industrialized and agricultural countries. Impact on extensive margins, however, will be positive (see column (1) in table 2). As expected, RTAs will have the very same type of impact on trade. Distance, as a proxy for variable costs of trade based on the Samuelson’s “iceberg costs” is expected to decrease trade volumes. According to our estimates, a 10% increase in distance will lead to 28.9% decrease in the volume trade (see column (7) in table 2). That is a consistent result, as international freights tend to be a significant component of trade costs. The access to the Pacific Ocean by the U.S. will make “iceberg costs” of exporting to China smaller when compared to costs of Brazilian exports to the same market. Additionally, results of HMR-I (3) suggest that distance has a negative impact on the probability of trade, but a positive effect in volumes. This can be a result of gains of scale. Related to distance effects, the estimates show that countries sharing a land border will trade significantly more than others. Finally, we can expect that endowment of land will be important to partially explain the formation and direction of soybean trade flows. This variable can be somehow interpreted as the effects of differences in input costs  and  that will lead to industry specialization, ceteris paribus. It is a source of trade mostly considered in HO models, but also treatable in the framework developed by Eaton and Kortum (2002), if we assume that relative endowments of land will impact the costs of production of agricultural goods. The difference in land endowment will impact mostly on the extensive margin of trade. If this difference increases by 10%, trade will increase by approximately 1.87%. Note that the values of the coefficients are very similar in HMR-I (3) model. In sum, the trade between countries located geographically closer, sharing a border, with colonial ties and different factors endowment (land) is comparatively more frequent and higher in volume. Remarkably, countries under regional trade agreements and considered as the same countries trade more often but in lower volumes.Impacts of technological variablesPrecisely, differences in mandatory labeling regimes are more a proxy for regulation asymmetry than for technological change, impacting mostly on the extensive margin of trade. This assumption is based on several studies, which points out that mandatory labeling is one of the most detrimental factors impacting trade of GMOs(Carter e Gruère, 2006; Foster, 2010; Regimes e Giannakas, 2013). There are evidences that countries with mandatory labeling imported soybeans primary from Brazil, at least until the end of 2012 (Oliveira et al., 2013). Authors estimated that when mandatory labeling regimes are increased by one year, imports from Brazil increase by 4.5%. The existence of a mandatory labeling regime in destination and absence in sourcing countries decreases the probability of trade almost by 3%. Beforehand, we can see that the coefficients of our technological variables behavior steadily in all models.                   The Demand Lag variable, in turn, was defined based on the general idea of imitation lag developed by Posner (1961). In this study we consider that the lag will enlarge market shares of countries producing the old good in markets averse to the technology. The duration and the proportion of the lag will determine the backward effects of technology. We assume that technology-gap is also key to determine trade volumes. The rationale behind this is that international competition and innovation rate will create an international technology frontier, which is constantly moving forward given the pace and nature of innovation in the economic system. As technology will impact on the overall production costs and not all the countries developed technology “hatred”, there will be gains of adoption that should be considered. From that, trade should increase as countries adopted newer and better technologies of production, in those markets without high levels of technology hatred. That is because in “common” markets, “common” technological effects are expected to stand out – i.e. the positive impact of technology on overall production costs will be a source of comparative advantage. Our estimates from the FE (7) in 2 show that the technological gap is statistically and economically significant. For each variety that a producing country doesn’t grant approval for any reason, trade will decrease by 16.4% on average. Looking at the coefficients of HMR-I (3) we can say that impacts can be even larger – 3.4% in the extensive margin and 22.2% in the intensive margin. Interestingly, the demand lag will have a very similar impact. A difference in approved varieties between exporting and importing countries will decrease trade by 16%. HMR-I (3) also returns greater coefficients - 2.1% decreases in the extensive and 24.9% in the intensive margins. The similarity of the impacts of both variables may be an indication of the existence of certain market rationality in approving new varieties, which balances opportunity costs of not approving new and better varieties, and the commercial risks involved in adopting too many varieties in the context of certain level of technology “hatred”. Notwithstanding, the technological advance and development of new and better varieties considerably increased the opportunity costs of non-adoption. From a more evolutionary perspective, very high opportunity costs can make an advantage of an innovator irreversible. In other words, in the absence of non-technological advantages if a proved better technology is available and adopted by other producing countries, the late-mover can fail to catch-up, loosing significant shares of the market or even leaving the marketplace. In sum, at the same time countries with more similar pace of approvals – smaller demand-lags – tend to trade more (extensively and intensively), there are opportunity costs of not approving better varieties that can decrease trade at the same time. In other others, we are saying that countries faced a kind of technological trade-off in deciding about adoption under technology rejection. ConclusionsThe central aim of this paper was to study the relationship of technological gap and demand lag on bilateral trade under high levels of “hatred” toward the “new” product. The case of GM-soybean is a suitable experiment, since both the adoption rate in producing countries and the acceptance of the “new” product in international markets were asymmetric and asynchronous across time and countries. Moreover, the production and consumption of soybeans are concentrated at country level, mitigating problems related to the lack of disaggregated data of trade on conventional and GM grains. In the international arena, Brazil, United States, Argentina at the supply side, and China and the EU countries at the demand side, are the protagonists of the history of trade in soybeans. Brazil adopted the technology ten years after growers in U.S. and Argentina planted their first genetically modified seeds. On the other hand the EU members, the second largest destination of soybeans, developed high levels of technology hatred. Yet, China hasn’t raised significant bans against the consumption of GMOs, being an important player to mitigate commercial risks.Considering the underlying idea of technology differences creating comparative advantages, the theory of firm heterogeneity and the central concepts of demand lag and technological gap, we structured a model in which bilateral trade is a function of sizes, variable and fixed costs of trade and technological variables. The inclusion of the technology-gap is our major contribution in the matter of correct specification of empirical models. Without this control, the analysis is partial, since technology hatred is not verified in everywhere. We found that both the technological gap and the demand lag had significant impacts on trade. Impacts can be seen in the extensive and intensive margins. We believe results can contribute to better designs of technological and trade policies, since they provide a broader perspective of technological effects on trade. We also believe that other similar cases marked by technological frictions can emerge at anytime, as the “preference for technology” seems to be a structural change in consumption patterns. The increased concern about the production means and their relation with ethical, environmental, social and economic factors will likely increase trade conflicts if multilateral bodies have reduced coordination power – as seen in the case of modern biotechnology and trade. Clearly, agriculture is the sector to which impacts tend to be more noteworthy, given the especial features faced by this sector, as intense competition in international markets and increased concern of consumers about food safety. Lastly, future research on the relationship of technological change and trade is needed to advance in theoretical developments, especially to relax some of the strong assumptions on consumer behavior. Empirical studies of other products and industries is also required to investigate if this effect is particular to agricultural goods subjected to commercialization approval, or the technological effects can be thought from a more general perspective.
