Abstract 
The reversal of the increasing trend of crime in the state of São Paulo has raised interest to determine 
its  possible  causes.  Several  factors  have  been  suggested  by  literature  to  explain  this  great  crime 
decline. Our hypothesis is that the police productivity shock generated by INFOCRIM was the crucial 
factor for explaining the decline. Thus, this work aims to evaluate the impact of INFOCRIM on crime 
in the state of São Paulo. We adopted the synthetic control method to perform a case study of the 
impact  of  INFOCRIM  on  homicide  rates  in  the  state  of  São  Paulo.  We  compare  outcomes  under 
INFOCRIM against a counterfactual of “state of São Paulo without INFOCRIM”. We estimated that 
the homicide rate with INFOCRIM decreased 37 per cent in comparison to the homicide rate in the 
synthetic São Paulo scenario without INFOCRIM.

A inversão da tendência crescente do crime no estado de São Paulo despertou interesse em determinar 
suas possíveis causas. Diversos fatores têm sido sugeridos pela literatura para explicar esse grande 
declínio do crime. A hipótese adotada é a de que o choque de produtividade da polícia gerado pelo 
INFOCRIM  foi  o  fator  crucial  para  explicar  o  declínio.  Assim,  este  trabalho  tem  como  objetivo 
avaliar o impacto do INFOCRIM no crime no estado de São Paulo. Para tanto, adotou-se o método 
de  controle  sintético  para  realizar  um  estudo  de  caso  do  impacto  do  INFOCRIM  nas  taxas  de 
homicídio no estado de São Paulo. Comparou-se os resultados no INFOCRIM com um contrafactual 
do “estado de São Paulo sem o INFOCRIM”. Estimou-se que a taxa de homicídios com INFOCRIM 
diminuiu 37% em comparação com a taxa de homicídios no cenário sintético de São Paulo sem  o 
INFOCRIM.

1. Introduction 

Crime imposes immense social costs and negative externalities, representing the pernicious 
effects  on  economic  activity  and  the  quality  of  people’s  life  (Lochner  and  Moretti,  2004).  For 
instance, the cost of violence in Brazil was estimated to be 5.9% of 2016 GDP (Anuário Brasileiro 
da Segurança Pública, 2017). Obviously, the violence cost is high because the criminality rates are 
high in Brazil, which concentrates 14% of all homicides in the world, thus being part of the top ten 
of the violence ranking, according to Health World Organization (Waiselfsz, 2015).  

As reported in table 1, there is a clear uptrend in Brazil’s homicide rate over the years.  In 
1980, there were 10.8 homicides per one hundred thousand people in  Brazil, whereas in  2014 the 
homicide rate was already of 34.6. Over this period, crime in Brazil increased more than 220%. 

The regional distribution reveals that crime has spread out to all Brazilian macro-regions. In 
the period of 1980 to 1999, all macro-regions faced an increase in homicide rates (table 1). Some 
regions  are above the  Brazilian average, such as  the Southeast  (149%), the  North  (135%) and the 
Central-West  (151%),  while  other  regions  are  below  the  Brazilian  average,  namely,  the  Northeast 
(94%) and the South (60%). The leading Brazilian state in crime growth during this period was São 
Paulo (220%), with a homicide rate of 44.1, higher than the Brazilian average (24.1). From 1999 to 
2014, Brazil had a slowdown in crime growth, but even so, it faced an increase of 43%. In this period, 
all regions, except the Southeast, showed an increase in their homicide rates. The negative highlight 
was the crime growth in the Northeast region (160%).

In contrast to this crime surge in Brazil, the homicide rate in the state of São Paulo,1 after a 
skyrocketing trend, reversed this trend in 2000 by showing a sharp drop in incidence, returning to the 
crime level of the early eighties, as in figure 1. There was a decline of almost 70% in the homicide 
rate in the state of São Paulo, making it one of the three states with the lowest  crime levels in the 
country.2 This is the “Great Paulista Crime Decline Puzzle”. The reversal of criminality in São Paulo 
was celebrated by the United Nations as a successful case, along with New York and Bogota. 

The fundamental question that arises is the following: while Brazil and the other states are 
facing increasing criminality, what is the cause of this great crime decline in the state of São Paulo? 
Such a great crime decline in the 2000s has motivated intense debate in the literature to try to address 
this  question.  There  are  several  competing  hypotheses  to  explain  it.  Some  hypotheses  involve 
nationally scoped policies and, while others involve policies that occurred only in São Paulo.

As to national scoped events, there is a suggested hypothesis about the impact of Brazil’s gun 
control laws on the crime decline in the state of São Paulo (Hartung, 2009; Cerqueira, 2010; Cerqueira 
and Mello, 2012; Souza et al. 2007). 3  This hypothesis hinges on the argument of "less weapons, less 
crimes". In Brazil, 88% of all homicides involve firearms. In this context, the argument is that fewer 
circulating weapons would reduce crimes motivated by interpersonal conflict. Gun control laws have 
increased  the  cost  of  carrying  firearms,  reducing  their  demand,  alongside  with  the  voluntary 
devolution of firearms in exchange for money (buy-back). The hypothesis is that such a policy has 
reduced the stock of firearms.4 

From an empirical approach, Cerqueira and Mello (2012) adopt a panel data model to estimate 
the  effect  of  guns  on  violent  crimes  and  on  property  crime,  using  a  proxy  for  the  prevalence  of 
firearms  (suicides  committed  with  firearms  divided  by  total  of  suicides)  and  using  also  an 
instrumental variable for this proxy to correct endogeneity. The authors presented evidence that gun 
control  measures,  operated  in  the  state  of  São  Paulo  between  2001  and  2007,  decreased  violent 
crimes.  The  problem  with  this  explanation  is  that  gun  control  laws  were  implemented  throughout 
Brazil after June 2004, but the study used only information from the state of São Paulo. If gun control 
laws reduce crime, it must be valid for the entire national territory. The authors did not validate the 
gun control laws hypothesis by expanding the study area for Brazil as a whole. In the guise of partial 
validation,  using  information  from  all  Brazilian  federative  units,5  we  ran  the  first  differences  in 
homicide rates between 2000 and 2010 (DHOMRATE) on the same proxy variable for prevalence of 
firearms  used  by  the  authors,  also  in  first  differences  (DSAF),  in  the  same  period.  There  is  no 
correlation between these variables. 

The soundest evidence on the impact of the buy-back program on crime is from Scorzafave et 
al.  (2015).  The  authors  analyzed  its  impact  on  deaths,  using  a  quasi-experimental  study  based  on 
matched difference-in-differences. The treatment  group was composed by Paraná’s municipalities, 

                                                           
3 Justus and Kassouf (2012; 2013) seek to investigate the impact of gun laws, but only for the city of São Paulo. 
4 According to Scorzafave et al (2015), only 3% of the stock of firearms in Brazil was withdrawn from circulation by the 
buy-back campaign. 
5 Brazil is divided into 27 federative units, being 26 states and one federal district. The map with the Brazilian states and 
federal district is in figure A.1 in the appendix. The list with names and initials of the Brazilian states and macro-regions 
is in table A.1 in the appendix as well.

the buy-back program was found out at all.  

Another  explanation  given  for  the  great  crime  decline  is  the  demographic  transition 
experimented by Brazilian society (Mello and Schneider, 2010). The basic idea behind this hypothesis 
is that young males aged fifteen to twenty-four are prone to commit offenses, representing a high-risk 
age  group  in  terms  of  involvement  with  offenses.  Consequently,  this  demographic  transition  has 
provoked the decline of the percentage of males between fifteen and twenty- four  years old in the 
population, which caused the reduction of crime. Once again, the validation test of this hypothesis 
was not done using information from all levels of Brazilian society.  

By ways of partial validation, using information from all Brazilian federative units, we ran the 
differences  between  homicide  rates  over  the  period  of  2000-2010  (dhomrate)  regarding  the 
differences  of  the  group  of  young  men  aged  15-24  years  for  the  same  period  (dcrimeage).  The 
correlation between these variables was not significant at the 10% level, casting doubt on the possible 
causal link.  

Sixty-seven municipal police forces were created over the period of 1999-2014 in São Paulo 
(Kahn and Zanetic, 2005). One might therefore conjecture that security policies at the municipal level 
may have been responsible for reducing crime in São Paulo. However, there was also the creation of 
municipal police forces throughout the country. Analyzing the implementation of municipal guards 
only for the state of São Paulo, and using a fixed-effect model for the period 2004-2009, Ferreira et 
al. (2016) found evidence of a drop in both the homicide rate and the robbery and theft rates due to 
the impact of the implementation of municipal police forces. The problem is that the study did not 
control  for  the  regression  of  INFOCRIM,  which  is  a  technological  information  system  similar  to 
COMPSTAT.  In  this  sense,  INFOCRIM  is  a  confounding  factor  because  it  is  correlated  with  the 
implementation of municipal police forces and, at the same time, related to crime, thus overshadowing 
the causal effect.  

In turn, Vital (2018) assessed the impact of this kind of policy on both homicide and vehicle 
theft rates, but now controlling for INFOCRIM. The author did not find evidences that the creation 
of municipal police forces had an impact on crime rates (homicide rates and vehicle theft rates) in 
São  Paulo  or  Brazil,  ruling  out  that  this  hypothesis  is  valid  to  explain  the  “great  Paulista  crime 
decline”. The absence of statistical significance lies in the fact that the assignment of municipal police 
forces is intended by law to protect public property and not to fight crime. In fact, what causes the 
decline of crime in São Paulo must be another factor that is missing in the estimation of the model, 
operating exclusively in this state. 

As  to  policies  that  were  just  implemented  in  the  state  of  São  Paulo,  dry  law  hypothesis  is 
regarded as a potential reason to explain the crime decline (Biderman et al, 2010; Kahn and Zanetic, 
2005;  Dualibi  et  al,  2007).  Sixteen  municipalities  in  São  Paulo  enacted  dry  laws  that  impose 
compulsory closing hours for bars and restaurants from 11pm to 6am all week long (Biderman et al, 
2010).  The  idea  behind  this  hypothesis  lies  in  the  fact  that  dry  laws  restrain  recreational  alcohol 
consumption  and  sales  by  imposing  compulsory  closing  hours.  The  restriction  of  alcohol 
consumption avoids the interpersonal confrontation that might lead to murders. There are two caveats 
with this explanation, acknowledged by the authors themselves (Biderman et al, 2010). First, it is not 
a general explanation since only 2.5% of the municipalities of the state adopted dry laws, therefore, 
insufficient to have an impact on the whole state. Second, the timing of implementation of the dry 
law does not match the onset of crime decline. All these cities implemented the dry law after 2001, 
except one, while the criminal drop started in the state of São Paulo in 2000.  

Another explanation claims that there was a monopolization of crime in the prison system by 
the PCC6 gang. The PCC Hypothesis would explain the reduction of crime by means of administering 
justice and of the meditation of personal conflicts and the monopolization of drug trade (Biderman et 

                                                           
6 The acronym PCC means “Primeiro Comando da Capital”, that is, “First Command of State’s Capital”.

al, 2014). 7 Working with data from January 2005 to October 2009, Biderman et al (2014) found a 
negative  effect  on  crime  in  some  slums  in  the  metropolitan  area  of  São  Paulo.  Once  again,  it  is 
noteworthy  that  the  crime  decline  happened  earlier.  In  addition,  Justus  et  al  (2016)  dismantle  this 
hypothesis, arguing that there was a crime decline in most of the municipalities of the state of São 
Paulo where there were no attacks by the PCC gang. Using a proxy for presence of the PCC gang, 
the authors did not find out any effect of PCC on crime. 

The bottom line is that we are skeptical about the identification of the causal effect of these 
hypotheses  suggested  by  the  literature  to  explain  the  great  crime  decline  in  São  Paulo.  The 
aforementioned  explanations  suffer  from  three  potential  shortcomings.  First,  the  timing  of  the 
implementation of these policies (gun control laws, dry laws and the PCC hypothesis) does not match 
the onset of the crime decline in São Paulo. Second, nationally scoped factors should be tested not 
only for São Paulo, but also for Brazil as a whole in order to validate their causal link (gun control 
laws, demographic transition and municipal police forces). Third, the majority of the studies did not 
control  for  the  INFOCRIM,  the  technology  oriented  to  the  public  security,  being  this  one  kind  of 
confounding factor.  

Our alternative hypothesis is that the police productivity shock experienced in the State of São 
Paulo, generated by INFOCRIM, was the crucial factor to explain its great crime decline. The causal 
channel that explains the crime reduction is  as follows:  the adoption of  INFOCRIM in 1999/2000 
represented  a  police  productivity  shock,  thereby  increasing  the  probability  of  a  criminal  being 
arrested. Consequently, there was a change in the behavior of potential criminals that reduced their 
chance of committing offenses. We consider this hypothesis more plausible than the others because 
the date of implementation of INFOCRIM matches the onset of the crime decline. In addition to, our 
hypothesis involves a distinctive factor that only happened in São Paulo. 

In our empirical strategy, we investigate the hypothesis of a police productivity shock as the 
main factor responsible for the great crime decline, using a synthetic control method. Our findings 
indicate  that  the  police  productivity  shock  caused  a  drop  in  the  homicide  rate  of  around  37%  in 
comparison to what would have happened with the crime rates in São Paulo, if it had not experimented 
this police productivity shock generated by the adoption of INFOCRIM. 

The organization of the paper is as follows. Next section describes the public security oriented 
policy,  INFOCRIM.  The  third  section  explains  the  empirical  strategy  adopted  and  the  data  set 
compiled. The fourth section discusses the results, whereas the final part concludes.   
 
2. Police Productivity Shock in the state of São Paulo  
 
We claim that the “great Paulista crime decline puzzle” is caused by the police productivity 
shock in São Paulo. The policy that had the greatest impact on the increase of police efficiency in São 
Paulo was the integrated technological information system, INFOCRIM, implemented when crime in 
São Paulo reached its peak. 

From 1999 onward, the state of São Paulo began to invest heavily in technological systems 
dedicated  to  fighting  crime.  This  investment  in  technology  at  the  service  of  public  security  has 
intensified the efficiency of police operations, increasing the likelihood of potential criminals to be 
arrested. This moment coincides with the onset of the reversal in the trajectory of the homicide rate 
for the state of São Paulo in 2000. 

INFOCRIM  is  a  technological  crime  tracking  system,  which  is  able  to  compile  in  online 
databases the entire information about criminality in the state of São Paulo. This information system 
is similar to COMPSTAT and includes the type of crime and the location of its occurrence on map. 
This unified criminal data and intelligence system geocodes police reports, detecting crime spots and 
allocating  police  forces  to  fight  crime  where  and  when  it  occurs.8  Besides,  by  transmitting  crime 
information in real-time and online, INFOCRIM allows coordinating police activities. 

                                                           
7 Some studies use ethnographic evidence in favor of the crime reduction in geographic areas dominated by PCC gangs 
(Dias, 2011; Willis, 2013 and 2015). 
8 Besides, INFOCRIM now includes FOTOCRIM, which is a photo database that contains prisoners’ photos.

All police departments have online access to INFOCRIM and police officers on streets can 
consult  the  system  by  means  of  computers  installed  on  the  vehicles.  INFOCRIM  has  affected  all 
stages  of  fighting  crime,  whether  at  the  stage  of  prevention,  repression  or  further  investigation  of 
crimes.  

An important step towards the implementation of INFOCRIM was the geocoding of police 
reports,  which  started  in  the  biennium  of  1999-2000  in  the  city  of  São  Paulo,  since  it  had  one  of 
highest  crime  rates  in  the  state  of  São  Paulo.9  From  2001  to  2003,  INFOCRIM  was  taken  to  38 
municipalities  that  make  up  the  metropolitan  region  of  the  city  of  São  Paulo.  These  39  cities 
concentrate  54%  of  all  homicides  in  the  state.  Over  the  period  of  2003-2005,  INFOCRIM  was 
implemented in five big cities in the countryside of São Paulo. In 2008, INFOCRIM was taken to 
eighteen other cities. The spatial distribution of municipalities with INFOCRIM in 2008 is shown in 
figure 2.  

Cabral  (2016)  carried  out  the  only  work  in  the  literature  that  investigated  the  impact  of 
INFOCRIM on crime in São Paulo. By means of the variation of the data within the state of São Paulo 
in  a  difference-in-differences  approach,  the  main  finding  indicates  that  the  municipalities  that 
received INFOCRIM had a lower homicide rate than the municipalities that were not contemplated 
with the program.

The increase in police productivity coming from the adoption of INFOCRIM is observed in 
table 2. As can be observed, over the period  of 2002-2014, seizures of drug trafficking per police 
officer increased by 218%, whereas arrests per police officer and people caught in the act per police 
officer rose, respectively, 55% and 50%.

Paulo.

The result of this increase in police productivity in São Paulo is the crucial factor explaining 
the large decline of approximately 70% in the homicide rate between 2000 and 2014. In addition, the 
increase in police productivity also explains the reduction of crimes against property. Figure 3 shows 
the downward trajectory of vehicle theft and vehicle robbery rates.10 In the period 2001-2014, the 
vehicle theft and robbery rate fell, respectively, 51% and 55%. Extending the time interval to 2017, 
the vehicle theft and robbery rate decreased, respectively, 63% and 73%.  

Therefore, our hypothesis is that INFOCRIM, a technological system at the service of public 
security,  has  increased  police  productivity,  raising  the  likelihood  of  criminals  being  arrested  and 
thereby  reducing  crime.  Such  an  increase  in  police  productivity  was  the  distinguishing  factor  in 
relation to the situation of the other states, which did not have this technological shock. Moreover, 
the starting date of INFOCRIM (1999/2000) coincides with the beginning of the reversal of the crime 
trend in São Paulo (2000).

3. Empirical Strategy 
3.1. Construction of Synthetic Control 

In order to evaluate the impact on crime generated by the police productivity shock generated 
by the adoption of INFOCRIM in São Paulo, it is necessary to compare the situation of this state after 
the occurrence of the productivity shock with the situation that would prevail in the same state if there 
had not been a productivity shock. Clearly, the last outcome is not observed. Therefore, such outcome 
should  be  conjectured  by  building  up  a  counterfactual  for  São  Paulo  in  such  a  way  that  the  only 
difference between São Paulo and the control group would be the police productivity shock generated 
by INFOCRIM.  

A way to build up a counterfactual is to make an experiment by randomly choosing a treatment 
group  and  a  control  group.  However,  the  difficulty  for  building  up  a  controlled  experiment  in 
economics  is  widely  known.  Most  frequently,  economists  and  social  scientists  have  to  use 
observational data instead of sampling data, in order to assess a policy impact. Therefore, economists 
endeavor to find some options in order to build up a quasi-experiment, which attempts to mimic a 
random experiment (Cameron and Trivedi, 2005). 

First of all, one should notice the peculiarities of this particular quasi-experiment. We have 
only one Brazilian state that has adopted INFOCRIM in our study. In addition, the set of untreated 
regions that can make up the control group is limited to, at most, the other 26 federative units. Given 
this quasi-experimental scenario, the lack of observations makes it unfeasible to adopt some of the 
most popular approaches to implement impact assessment, such as differences-in-differences (DID) 
and the data-panel approach estimated by the instrumental variables method. 

Alternatively, the  synthetic control method is  adopted in the literature  for studying several 
subjects when geocoded data are used (as for example, regions, census tracts, districts, planning areas, 
counties, municipalities, states, countries, etc.). Such a method has proved to have several advantages 
(Abadie and Garzeabadal, 2003; Abadie et al, 2010). For instance, an advantage of synthetic control 
over differences-in-differences method rests on the fact that synthetic control takes into account non 
observable idiosyncratic characteristics, both time invariant and time variant (Abadie et al, 2010). It 
is  noteworthy  to  remember  that  the  differences-in-differences  approach  considers  only  these 
characteristics invariant in time that are removed from the estimation by double differencing. 

In  view  of  these  advantages,  the  synthetic  control  was  adopted  for  the  elaboration  of  the 
counterfactual by seeking a synthetic trajectory of the homicide rate to the state of São Paulo. The 
creation of a control group aims to synthesize the trajectory of counterfactual result for this particular 
region, using information from similar regions. The basic goal is that the synthetic São Paulo should 
accurately resemble the trajectory of the homicide rate of the actual São Paulo. To do so, we used a 
data-driven procedure to choose control groups in order to reduce the discretion of this choice.  

The synthetic group is formed by a weighted average of potential other states that do not suffer 
the same treatment. There are two elements in this creation of synthetic control, namely, choice of 
control  states  and  the  choice  of  weights  of  the  states  in  the  computation of  the  weighted  average. 
Weights are chosen to minimize the difference between the previous level of the homicide rate for 
the synthetic São Paulo and the previous level of the homicide rate for the actual São Paulo. Besides, 
these weights  on each state in  the control  group  are  constrained to  be non-negative and  their sum 
equals one.11  

For the same reason, the choice of control states was made with the purpose of having similar 
characteristics to the state of São Paulo. This similarity hinges on the homicide rate and its predictors 
grounded by theoretical concerns. In our case, the predictors used here are based on crime literature 
(Becker, 1968; Ehrlicht, 1977; Kelly, 2000).   

The basic assumption of identification is that the synthetic São Paulo accurately reproduces 
what  would  happen  to  the  actual  São  Paulo,  if  that  state  had  not  implemented  INFOCRIM. 
Nonetheless, there are other identification challenges. A problem often overlooked is the violation of 
the  assumption  of  no  interference  between  units  (Rosenbaum,  2007).  The  explicit  assumption  of

synthetic  control  is  that  the  assumption  of  no  interference  between  units  is  valid.  There  are  two 
possibilities that may violate this assumption in our study. First, other states may have been influenced 
by INFOCRIM implemented in São Paulo and may have imitated it. Therefore, we should exclude 
all those states from the donor pool utilized to construct the synthetic control. Second, this assumption 
can  be  violated  in  the  presence  of  spatial  displacement  of  crime.  If  this  does  occur,  the  police 
productivity shock in São Paulo will contaminate its contiguous neighbors. The way to handle this 
kind of contamination within the synthetic control approach is also to eliminate these neighbors from 
the donor pool.  
 
3.2. Data and Sample 

 

In this study, we adopted annual  state-level  panel  data for the period  of  1980-2014 for the 
state of São Paulo and for other states that belong the donor pool. As INFOCRIM was implemented 
in 1999, there are 14 years before the intervention under study. Due to the lack of information for our 
outcome variable (homicide rate) prior to 1988, we removed Tocantins from the donor pool.  

In  Brazil,  no  other  state  had  adopted  a  public  security  oriented  technology  quite  like 
INFOCRIM. Notwithstanding, some states adopted other innovative public security policies, such as 
Rio de Janeiro with Peaceful Police Units , Minas Gerais with “Fica-Vivo” (Stay Alive) and Olho 
Vivo,  Ceará  with  community  policing  policy,  and,  finally,  Pernambuco  with  the  "Pact  for  Life". 
Including  these  states  in  the  pool  donor  could  contaminate  the  synthetic  control  group,  thereby 
mitigating the  effect  of  police productivity shock in  São Paulo. Therefore, as exposed previously, 
these states were excluded from the donor pool.  

One must be aware that Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Paraná and Mato  Grosso do Sul are 
neighbors to the São Paulo State. If there has been a spatial displacement of crime, such an effect 
could have contaminated the Synthetic São Paulo, which would attenuate the effect of productivity 
shock on crime. Thus, we excluded these neighboring states in the donor pool as well.  

Consequently, the potential donor pool to elaborate the synthetic São Paulo is composed of 
19 states. Since none of these potential control states has been treated, the synthetic control group 
should be independent of the direct effects of the treatment. 

Our  outcome  variable  is  homicide  rate  per  100,000  inhabitants.  This  proxy  for  crime  was 
chosen because the under-reporting is low. Besides, this crime information has been available to all 
Brazilian  states  for  several  years  since  1980.  The  homicide  data  come  from  DataSus,  which  is  a 
database of the Brazilian Ministry of Health.  

The  variables  used  as  predictors  for  the  construction  of  synthetic  control  were  income  per 
capita, poverty rate, education, population density, income inequality and serially lagged homicide 
rates (1998, 1990, 1985 and 1980). More information on these variables is reported in table 3.

4. Results 
To evaluate the impact of the police productivity shock on crime, it is necessary to build up a 
 
control group to furnish a counterfactual if São Paulo had not had such a shock. Figure 4 shows the 
increasing temporal trajectory of the homicide rate of the other states in comparison with São Paulo. 
One perceives that it would not be appropriate to use this control group to do the counterfactual since 
the parallel-trend assumption is not met.

In order to be regarded as a good counterfactual, a control group requires that its observable 
and non-observable characteristics must be similar, on average, to the State of São Paulo. Table 4 
reports the means of the predictors used in the implementation of the synthetic control. As can be 
observed, the synthetic group for the state of São Paulo displays averages for these predictors close 
in magnitude, except for income and density.

When implementing the synthetic control, five donor states received weights greater than zero 
to  form  the  control  group  for  the  State  of  São  Paulo,  namely  Rondônia  (0.340),  Amapá  (0.406), 
Alagoas (0.032), Espírito Santo (0.092) and Mato Grosso (0.129). This weighting structure points out 
that the homicide rate trend in São Paulo is best represented by a weighted average of these states.  
 
Figure  5  depicts  our  assumption  of  identification,  tracing  the  trajectories  of  the  actual  São 
Paulo and the synthetic São Paulo for the homicide rate. Looking at this figure, at first we verify that 
the synthetic series behaved as a good counterfactual, since it predicted adequately the homicide rate 
in the absence of INFOCRIM. This is confirmed by the root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) 
of  synthetic  series  in  comparison  with  the  original  series.  During  the  pre-treatment  period,  the 
RMSPE  value  was  1.46,  considered  a  very  good  fit  for  the  homicide  rate  in  São  Paulo  prior  to 
INFOCRIM.

The homicide rate trends for the Synthetic São Paulo and the actual São Paulo are parallel 
until  approximately  1999.  During  the  period  of  2000-2003,  there  is  a  detachment  in  this  trend.  In 
contrast, after 2003, the synthetic trajectory was above the trajectory of the series for actual São Paulo. 
Thus, one concludes that the police productivity shock of the state of São Paulo was able to reduce 
homicide rates considerably. 

 

 

11 

 
In addition to the graphical analysis, it is possible to calculate the average effect of the police 
productivity  shock  on  crime.  To  do  so,  one  must  calculate  the  ratio  between  the  actual  and  the 
synthetic  homicide  rates.  Afterwards,  the  average  is  calculated  for  the  periods  subsequent  to  the 
treatment. Our results indicate that for the entire 2000-2014 period, the homicide rate had a decline 
of 36.9%. 

In order to check the  falsification of the results, three placebo tests were performed.  In the 
first placebo test, we applied the synthetic control to estimate the impact of INFOCRIM in São Paulo 
to every state in the donor pool. In each placebo run one control state is considered as treated in 1999 
(that is, adopting INFOCRIM), shifting São Paulo to the donor pool. The idea is to check if the gap 
in Figure 5 was created by factors other than INFOCRIM (Abadie et al, 2010). 

The  purpose  of  the  test  was  to  check  if  the  difference  for  the  treated  state  of  São  Paulo 
generates some different behavior when compared to the differences of the other non-treated states. 
If the effect of São Paulo is located at the extremities of figure 6, there is statistical significance of 
the police productivity shock generated by INFOCRIM. Figure 6 depicts the results of this placebo 
test. The gray lines stand for the gap related to each placebo run, displaying the difference in homicide 
rate between each state in the donor pool and its synthetic control. Similarly, the red line describes 
the gap in homicide rate estimated for São Paulo. As can be observed in figure 6, the line representing 
the gap in homicide rate for São Paulo starts to be located at the lower end of the distribution of the 
gaps  for  states  in  the  donor  pool,  denoting  the  statistical  significance  of  the  impact  of  the  police 
productivity shock.

In turn, the second test stands for a temporal placebo. The intuitive idea behind this test was 
to check if the effect found in 1999 is not spurious. To do so, new synthetic series was generated with 
pretreatment  periods  set  back  in  five  years  (1994).  Even  with  the  new  pretreatment  period,  our 
expectation was that there would be no changes in the point where the synthetic and treated series 

12 

 

actually  separated.  The  synthetic  trajectory  constructed  by  figure  7  followed  the  trajectory  of  the 
treated series, similar to the results of figure 5. This means that the pre-shock period receded in time 
to 1994 did not alter the previous results.

At last, we checked the robustness when the assumption of no interference between units was 
relaxed. Therefore, we included the neighbors of São Paulo, as well as the states that implemented 
innovative  security  policies  in  the  donor  pool.  We  got  then  a  new  synthetic  control,  which  is 
composed of 21.0% Rondônia (RO), 13.5% Amapá (AP), 14.0% Pernambuco (PE), 2.3% Alagoas 
(AL), 14.2% Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), 14.9% Mato Grosso (MT) and 20.1% Distrito Federal (DF). 
It is noteworthy that the synthetic control had then a state that implemented an innovative security 
policy (PE) and another state (MS), which is neighbor of São Paulo, violating, thereby, the assumption 
of no interference between units. Figure 8 depicts the homicide rate trajectories for  the actual São 
Paulo and for the synthetic São Paulo, but now allowing an enlarged donor pool with 25 potential 
control states. Our result indicates a decline in crime of 37.4%, which is very similar to the result 
obtained  with  a  synthetic  control  without  neighbors  and  states  that  adopted  innovative  security 
policies. Thus, our results seem to be robust.

5. Final Remarks 

 

The article evaluated the impact on crime of the police productivity shock generated by the 
adoption  of  INFOCRIM  in  the  state  of  São  Paulo.  Our  findings  indicate  a  decline  in  crime  of 
approximately  37%  compared  to  the  state  of  São  Paulo's  crime  trajectory,  had  it  not  had  this 
productivity shock. Therefore, we consider that the police productivity shock was the crucial factor 
to explain the great Paulista crime decline and to solve the puzzle. 

In  the  end,  this  article  has  two  messages:  one  pessimistic  and  another  optimistic.  The 
pessimistic  message  is  that  crime  in  Brazil  has  spread  over  the  last  fifteen  years,  practically 
throughout the country, with an increasing trend, except for the state of São Paulo. The optimistic one 
is that all other Brazilian states may also reduce their crime rates by adopting a public security policy 
similar to INFOCRIM.
