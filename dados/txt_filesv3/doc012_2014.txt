Abstract 
 
Since the WW II, two development conventions have been  disputing hegemony in Brazil: a pro-growth – state 
led  and  a  pro-stability  –  free  market  conventions.  Until  the  1970s,  the  so  called  “developmentist”  convention 
was  hegemonic,  and  in  the  1980s  the  stability  convention  started  ascending.  The  rise  of  neoliberalism  in  the 
1990s, reinforced  the  precedence  of  stability  over  growth.  In  1999,  a  new  economic  policy  (EP)  was  adopted 
based on the tripod: inflation targeting; floating exchange rate; and budget surplus targeting. Aligned to the New 
Consensus in Macroeconomics, it counts solely on the interest rate to control inflation. Until the global crisis, it 
was  paramount.  But,  it  locked  Brazilian  economy  in  a  trap:  low  growth;  high  interest  rates;  relatively  high 
inflation;  and  overvalued  currency.  Under  Lula  and  mainly  under  Dilma’s  term,  EP  has  been  changing 
attempting  supporting  growth.  But  it  does  not  mean  a  true  inflexion  in  the  EP  far  less  the  adoption  of  a 
Keynesian  one.  The  change  is  Palley’s  gattopardo  change:  “change  that  keeps  tings  the  same”.  The  new 
measures left untouched the essence of the 1999 adopted EP. The changes only mask the orthodoxy of EP. So, it 
is troublesome arguing the process of formation of a new hegemonic development convention is under way.

1. Introduction 

Since the World War II, two development conventions (DCs from now on) have been disputing 
hegemony  in Brazil:  a  pro-growth  – state led and a  pro-stability  – free market  convention.  Until the 
1970s,  the  so  called  “developmentist”  convention  was  hegemonic,  and  in  the  1980s  the  stability 
convention began its ascent reinforced with the surge of neoliberalism in the 1990s.  

Under President Cardoso, a new economic policy (EP) regime, aligned to the New Consensus in 
Macroeconomics  (NCM),  was  adopted  in  1999  based  on  the  tripod:  inflation  targeting;  floating 
exchange rate; and primary budget surplus targeting. 1  

It  locked  the  economy  in  a  trap:  low  growth;  chronically  high  interest  rates;  relatively  high 
inflation; and overvalued currency. To get out of  it, timid attempts started in President Lula’s second 
term  (2007-10),  and  under  President  Dilma  the  process  of  change  was  intensified,  involving  fiscal, 
financial, exchange rate and capital, and even monetary measures.  

But, the whole change  was gattopardo change  in the terminology of Palley (2013:  1):  “change 

that keeps things the same”. Being cosmetic, they left untouched the very essence of the EP.  

This  paper  has  four  sections  besides  this  introduction.  Section  2  presents  the  concept  of 
development  convention  and  its application to the case of Brazil after  WW II. In section 3,  is  firstly 
summed  up  the  tripod’s  main  goals  and  some  quantitative  results  and,  secondly,  is  detailed  the 
measures that eased it, mostly under President Dilma. Section 4 gives an overview of the change in the 
EP  framework  as  a  whole  and  also  introduces  Palley’s  concept  of  gattopardo  change  to  eventually 
argue that Dilma’s policy, though somehow differentiated from that prevailing during 1999-2007, does 
not fulfill the necessary condition to the rise of a hegemonic DC. Our final remarks are in section 5.  

 

2. Development conventions and economic policy in Brazil  
2.1. The concept of development convention: Erber’s contribution  

 

With a rather practical view, Salais (1989: 213) has suggested that “[t]he etymology of the word 
helps  to  precise  what  we  should  understand,  generally  speaking,  by  convention.  Convention  comes 
from the Latin word conventio, originated itself from convenire: to come together, and in a figurative 
sense to be in accordance”.2 

With  similar grasp of  French  Convencionalists (FC), Erber has conceptualized convention as  a 
“heuristic  device  for  dealing  with  uncertainty”,  in  the  Knight-Keynes  sense,  as  far  as  it  provides 
socially  shared  “guiding  rules”  necessary  to  structure  individual  expectation  and  behavior,  thus 
reducing  inergodic  uncertainty  and  inducing  economic  or  social  coordination.  Rules  that  establish 
“positive  and  negative  agendas”  [as  suggested  by  Lakatos  (1970)]  which  set  up  “a  hierarchy  of 
problems (e.g. inflation control, income distribution) which must be tackled”, and discern “solutions to 
such problems which are acceptable (e.g. inflation targeting) or not (e.g. administrative price controls), 
organizations  in  charge  (e.g.  Central  Bank),  as  well  as  rules  and  regulations  (e.g.  Basle  banking 
rules)”.  And  eventually  a  teleology  that,  giving  “coherence”  to  the  guiding  rules,  strengths  their 
guiding power by means of  a “historical metaphor – a story, a theory, which explains how the present 
arouse out of the past and, especially,  how the future will be if the rules are followed” (Erber, 2004: 
40; 2012: 7-8; our emphasis ).  

                                                             
1 The emergency of the New Consensus on Macroeconomics (Blinder, 1981; 1997; Taylor, 1993; 2000; Allsopp e Vines, 2000; 
Romer, 2000) is associated with the growing popularity of inflation targeting and the resulting acceptance that, even where the 
regime is not adopted, the main instrument of monetary policy is the interest rate, and no longer the monetary aggregates of 
three decades ago, influenced by Friedmanian monetarism. The new consensus theoretical core is giving by the confluence of 
monetarism, new classical and real business cycle theory. The natural rate of unemployment and rational expectations 
hypothesis are among the two most relevant assumptions shared by this large group of economists (Lavoie, 2004; Setterfield, 
2004; 2005; Arestis and Sawyer, 2004; 2005; Fontana and Palacio-Vera, 2002; Setterfield, 2004; 2005; 2006). Another 
fundamental part is the Taylor rule – which holds that the central banks should determine its interest rate aimed at an explicit 
or implicit inflation target, and at keeping GDP growth near to its potential. We agree with Lavoie that “the only truly new 
element in the new consensus (...) is the rejection of the exogenous supply of money, and the replacement of money growth 
rule for a real interest rate targeting rule (…)” (Lavoie, 2004: 23).

Erber  (2012)  has  remarked  that  a  convention  is  an  authentic  social  phenomenon  transcending 
individual actions or judgments of the social actors participating of its formation, who nevertheless are 
eventually  affected  by  it.  A  convention  is  a  pattern  of  behavior  or  judgment  constituted  by  the 
interaction  of  social  actors  each  of  whom  trying  to  take  a  decision  or  to  form  an  expectation  under 
inergodic conditions.3 

As  Dequech  (2003:  p.  146)  has  pointed  out,  “different  concepts  of  rationality  and  convention 
have  been  used  by  different  economists  (…).  Despite  their  conceptual  differences,  these  economists 
have something in common: (…) they all tend to focus on the rationality of following a convention (or 
a rule or the like)”. 

Erber has also been influenced by the French school of regulation and applied its concepts and 
theses to the analysis of the pattern of development in Brazil – a key factor to understand the meaning 
of DC.4 He defines pattern of development as a “(…) set of  relations  between  economic and social 
agents that ensure, for a given period of time, the continuity of the processes of capital accumulation 
and  the  preservation  of  political  power”  p.  8;  our  highlights;  our  translation).  In  the  economic 
dimension, these relations are translated into a set of  standards regulating: accumulation; production; 
consumption;  funding;  innovation  and  diffusion  of  technology;  State  intervention;  and  international 
insertion. 

Erber’s  concept  of  convention  is  in  line  with  the  notion  of  Mode  de  Régulation  [Mode  of 
Regulation].  Boyer  and  Saillard    (2002:  p.  41)  state  that  “a  mode  of  regulation  establishes  a  set  of 
procedures  and  individual  and  collective  behaviour  patterns  which  must  simultaneously  reproduce 
social  relations  through  the  conjunction  of  institutional  forms  which  are  historically  determined”. 
Agents are involved by series of institutional arrangements that socialize and restrict both information 
and cognitive abilities, adopting situated rationality. It ensures compatibility of a set of decentralized 
decisions, without requiring agents to internalize  the principles governing the overall dynamic of the 
system (Aglietta, 1997). Modes of regulation may differ, depending on time and location, and evolve 
as a result of the interactions of its institutional forms (Benassy et al., 1979). 

FC and Erber have all of them taken as departure point the pioneer employment of the concept of 
convention in the economic field by Keynes (1936)5.  FC have innovated by proposing the convention 
occurrence in a new set of economic areas, e. g. in the work market. Later on, Erber has also made an 
original contribution by formulating a concept of development convention.6 

Keynes  (1937:  214)  –  where  the  author  “most  extensively  discusses  the  following  of  conventions 
under  uncertainty”  (Dequech,  ibid.:  p.  148)  –  proposes  that  we  follow  a  conventional  judgement  (or 
behavior) when “we endeavor to conform with the majority or the average” – not necessarily with all the 
members of the whole  society. This allows Dequech (ibid., p. 147) to simply  say that  “conventions are 
usually  thought  of  as  involving  several  people”,  or  else  a  “given  population”  within  a  societ y  (Dupuy, 
1989).7  Being  so,  the  coexistence  in  a  given  society  of  a  plurality  of  conventions  about  a  same  social-
economic matter is always possible. 

Erber  (2008a,  2012)  has  formulated  the  concept  of  development  convention  founding  it  in  a 
rather  comprehensive  and  didactical  conceptualization  of  convention  itself  which  encompass  FC’s 
contributions as those made by Dupuy (1989) and Orléan (1989). Therefore it seems to deserve being 
entirely reproduced here:  

                                                             
3 A similar point of view: “convention is a regularity that has its source in the social interactions but that presents itself to the 
actors under an objectified form” (Dupuy et al., 1989: 145; our translation). 
4  In  2008  Erber  spent  some  time  in  the  Centre  d’Economie  de  Paris  Nord  (at  Université  Paris  13),  doing  a  research  on 
development theory and political economy. 
5 Modenesi et al. (2013a) analyzed Keynes’s and FC’s convention approaches. For them, Keynes “has presented concepts of 
convention,  examples  of  convention  and  of  conventional  judgment  (or  behavior),  but has never  translated  its  content  into  a 
formalized  expression,  for  good  or  evil”  (ibid:  77).  See  also  Dequech  (2011).  For  Davis  (1997:  130),  Keynes  would  have 
deepened his convention treatment if he had written a “second edition The General Theory”. 
6 See Carvalho (2013), Lautier and Moreau (2012), and Thury and Freitas (2010). 
7 This is also the understanding of Salais (1989: 213): “[a] convention is a set of  elements that  – for the participants  of the 
convention – go together all the time, and about which they share a common agreement” (our translation and emphasis).

Such  set  of  rules,  the  positive  and  negative  agendas  they  generate  and  the  teleology  underlying  them  are  a 
convention – a collective representation which structures individual expectations and behavior (Orléan, 1989), in 
the sense that, given a population P, we observe a behavior C which holds the following characteristics: (1) C is 
shared  by  all  members  of  P;  (2)  every  member  of  P  believes  all  other  members  will  follow  C;  (3)  such  belief 
provides  members  of  P  with  a  sufficient  reason  to  adopt  C  Orléan  (2004)8.  A  convention  arises  out  of  the 
interaction of social agents but it is external to such agents and cannot be reduced to their individual cognition, i.e. 
it is an emergent phenomenon (De Wolf and Holvoet, 2005). In every society there are many conventions dealing 
with different aspects of economic and social behavior (e.g. quality of traded goods, the working of the financial 
system). Following our definition, a development convention is concerned with structural change. This begs the 
question  about  which  “structures”  are  to  be  changed?  The  answer  to  that  question  differentiates  development 
conventions (Erber, 2012, p.8; italics in original). 
 

Let’  emphasize  that  a  convention  is  a  “social  representation”  (Jodelet,  1989)  embodying  the 
necessary “beliefs” or “cognitive content” that together with the “political and economic power” of the 
population adherent to it are the determinants of its “strength and evolution” that, by its turn, enables 
the convention to subsume and to determine the individual judgment (or behavior) (Erber, ibid.: 8). 

It  is  also  worth  remarking  that,  as  development  is  related  to  long  term  structural  changes, 
development  convention  formation  correspondently  is  a  time  consuming  process,  as  far  as  people’s 
adherence  to  it  only  progress  to  the  extent  that  it  is  being  implemented  and  its  expected  results  are 
popping up. So that its agenda (and teleology) is working, i. e. convention’s promised achievements are 
being showed. Or, metaphorically: as far as the Promissed Land is perceived by the population as being 
nearby. It usually takes a long way for a development convention be established and eventually becoming 
hegemonic.9 Of course a hegemonic development convention may coexist with other(s). 

Summing  up,  development  conventions  do  exist  as  a  direct  result  of  the  concept  of  economic 
development itself. The structural changes subjacent to and characteristic of the development process 
produce  inergodic  uncertainty,  as  well  as  coordination  problems.  DC  convention  operates  mitigating 
the uncertainties and providing the pertinent coordination required by the development process. 

 

2.2. Development conventions in Brazil 

The developmentist convention was hegemonic from the end of WW II to 1970’s. Accordingly, 
development should be fostered by promoting structural changes under the leadership of the state. Its 
ideological  and  technical  content  was  mainly  provided  by  the  UN  Economic  Commission  for  Latin 
America (ECLA) diagnosis that underdevelopment was the counterpart of the process of evolution of 
capitalism.  In  line  with  the  structuralist  (or  center-periphery)  approach,  the  world  was  divided  in  a 
developed center and an underdeveloped periphery (Prebisch, 1949). Promoting industrialization was 
considered a  necessary condition to foster development. It also included in  its agenda the removal of 
bottlenecks  in  economic  infra-structure,  agriculture  modernization,  and  the  eventual  bettering  off 
people’s economic and social conditions.    

Most of ECLA’s propositions were inspired by the innovative Keynes’s General Theory and by 
the previous  “Anglo Saxon  structuralism”.10 Promoting the aimed structural economic-social changes 

                                                             
8  The  author  that  should  be  referred  to  is  not  Orléan  (2004),  but  Dupuy  (1989),  whose  original  definition  of  convention  is 
partially utilized here by Erber. 
9 As Keynes (1936) has explained a convention may be short or long-lived. 
10 Comprising “pioneers of development” according to Sanchez-Ancochea (2004): Rosesenstein-Rodan (1943), Nurkse (1953), 
Lewis (1954), Myrdal (1957). A major background influence was Karl Marx’s, but was also important Rosa of Luxemburg’s 
and  Joan  Robinson’s.  Furtado  (1979)  presents  “Marx’s  model”  of  capitalist  development,  underlining  that,  as  a  revolution, 
“Marx  behold  capitalism  mainly  from  the  standpoint  of  its  whole  dynamics,  of  its  ‘internal  contradictions’,  of  its  historical 
dimensions,  of  its  beginning  and  ending’  (1961:  32;  our  translation).  Telling  about  his  youth,  Furtado  (1985:  21;  our 
translation) asked “[h]ow not repudiating an economic system to which instability should attribute the emergence of  fascism 
and of an odious war?” to answering: “[w]ell, Marxism seemed to be the sole doctrine that promised a stable world, without 
unemployment  and  the  rentable  weapon  business”.  He  also  tells  that  Emmanuel  Mounier  once  said  to  him:  “Marxism,  in  a 
hundred years, was slain verbally more than the Christianity over centuries and yet its impact on human conscience remained 
as strong as ever” (ibid.: 21; our translation).

should be fulfilled by means of direct indirect state intervention: public enterprises, public investment, 
planning and incentives to private investments.11  

One  of  the  State’s  tasks  was  imposing  quantitative  controls  and  high  tariffs  on  the  import  of 
consumer  goods  and  easing  that  of  intermediary  and  capital  goods  considered  as  essential  ones  to 
industrialization.  This  pattern  of  industrialization  turned  to  be  known  as  “import  substitution”,  as 
explained by Tavares (1964) (see Bielschowsky, 1988). 

Structuralism  provides  the  teleology  of  developmentist  convention  as  far  as  it  explains  how 
underdevelopment  was originated  and  how  it can be  surmounted. It  also  provides the shared  guiding 
rules  to  coordinate  economic  agents’  expectation  and  behavior  and  then  reducing  uncertainty  and 
inducing  economic  and  social  coordination.  Those  rules  allows  to  specify  positive  and  negative 
agendas  which  establish  a  hierarchy  of  problems  to  be  solved  (e.g.,  the  deficiency  of  the  industrial 
sector,  the  infra-structure  bottlenecks),  and  design  acceptable  solutions  (e.g.,  import  substitution, 
public  investment  in  infra-structure)  and  discharge  non-acceptable  solutions  (e.g.,  reduce  growth  to 
control inflation). The convention also indicates the organizations responsible to achieve each goal and 
finally the rules and regulations that will govern the targets implementation.   

Price stabilization was not a goal, and some expected changes were not carried out. For instance, 
the  improvement  of  the  income  distribution,  land  reform,  labor  legislation  modernization,  and 
scientific  and  technological  area  did  not  receive  the  adequate  support.  In  few  words,  the 
developmentist  convention  was  adopted  only  in  a  restrict  version.  For  instance,  President  J. 
Kubitschek was elected with the slogan “fifty years [of development] in five years”. Indeed, during his 
administration, GDP growth rate was around 8% p.y and inflation reached 22% p.y. Nevertheless, he 
was viewed as a most prestigious president.  

The priority given to economic growth was even furthered by a right wing military coup in 1964 
(Furtado,  1985).  For  the  period  1946-79,  economic  performance  has  no  parallel  in  Brazil’s  history: 
GDP  growth rate  was 7,6%  p.y,  and the  industrial product  share  in the GDP  rose from 23% to  33%. 
Nevertheless, inflation accelerated progressively from 19% to 67%, and income distribution worsened 
(Gini coefficient increased from 0.535 to 0.589, from 1960’s to 1970’s). 

After the 1970’s, the pattern of development in Brazil began to be radically changed. During the 
“lost  decade”  (1980s),  economic  growth  vanished  drastically,  external  debt  grew  up  to  the  point  of 
generating  a debt  and a  fiscal  crises,  inflation went out of control and  – due to its  regressive effects 
income distribution – disturbed the functioning of economic system. 

Those  bad  results  gave  rise  to  a  cumulative  process  of  deconstruction  of  the  developmentist 
convention. On the other hand, in the wake of the global loosing of prestige of the Keynesian theory, 
the  Washington  Consensus  appeared with  a  new  neoliberal  agenda  – to be worldwide promoted and 
even imposed by the IMF and the World Bank – including fiscal discipline, privatization, deregulation, 
and current and capital  accounts  liberalization.  It also  brought  a new teleology:    liberalization  would 
pave the way for development. 

From  1985  to  1994,  six  stabilization  plans  failed  to  control  inflation.  During  Collor’s 
administration (1990-92) a privatization and  liberalization processes were adopted.  Only in 1994 the 
Real  Plan  (based  on  an  exchange  rate  anchor)  has  finally  brought  prices  under  control.  During 
Cardoso’s  terms  (1995-2002),  the  Washington  consensus  agenda  was  furthered  and  the  stability 
convention  eventually  became  hegemonic.12  Privatization  and  capital  account  liberalization  was 
deepened.  State  intervention  was  reduced  substantially  in  favor  of  free  market  operation.  Economic 
growth became secondary – or at best, a byproduct of price stability.  

In  1999,  the  exchange  rate  anchor  was  abandoned  in  favor  of  the  tripod  policy  comprising 
inflation targeting (IT); floating exchange rate; and primary budget surplus targeting. Aligned with the 
New  Consensus  on  Macroeconomics  it  turned  monetary  policy  the  sole  object  of  economic  policy 
attributing to fiscal policy the supporting role of not creating inflationary pressures. 

                                                             
11 According to Furtado (1985: 103), “CEPAL’s ideas armed ideologically  opponents of liberalism: industrialization was the 
only way to proceed with development” (our translation).

Nevertheless,  the  tripod  locked  Brazilian  economy  in  a  trap:  low  growth;  chronically  high 

interest rates; high inflation relatively to developing countries; and overvalued currency. 

In  Lula’s  second  term (2007-10), but  mostly  under  Dilma attempts to get out of this trap have 
been tried. This process gained momentum in the aftermath of the 2008  global  financial crisis. Since 
then the global financial crisis, the neoliberalism has been put under questioning and so it has seen its 
hegemony  being  threatened  worldwide,  as  far  as  orthodox  theory  and  policies  have  been  unable  to 
handle with the new macroeconomic challenges.  
 
3. The economic policy and its recent easing 

In this section is first briefed on going Brazilian EP making short references to the Real Plan, its 
remote origin,  making a  brief  balance,  mostly quantitative, of  its  main results and  pointing out  some 
problems  related to its  implementation. Secondly,  it is described  in some detail a  considerable  set of 
economic  measures,  taken  mostly  under  President  Dilma,  which  has  somehow  differentiated  the  EP 
prevailing before the 2008 international crisis from the one still going on today. This section paves the 
way to answering, in the following sections, why the change in EP as a whole cannot be considered as 
providing a new agenda to the eventual emergency of a new dominant DC. 

 

3.1 The economic policy tripod: main goals and results  

The  major  problem  of  Brazilian  economy  in  the  1980’s  and  early  1990’s  was  an  uncontrolled 
process of  high  inflation. Both heterodox and orthodox  economists  agreed that  inflation  had  become 
inertial, as far as the population had incorporated the inflationary memory: prices were indexed to the 
inflation of the previous period. With the adoption  of the  Real Plan  in 1994,  inflation was put under 
control at low levels (Fig. 1).

The Plan introduced a nominal exchange rate anchor sustained by excessively high interest rates, 
which attracted foreign capitals (Hermann, 1999). In the late 1990’s, with the crises of Asian emerging 
countries this strategy was turned unsustainable. Capital outflows prompted speculative attacks against 
the real (Figure 2). The lattermost speculative attack occurred in September of 1998, when the balance 
of payments registered a net outflow of US$  21.8 billion (see red arrows in  Fig. 2) and  international 
reserves fell 32.0%, from a level around US$ 70 to a level around US$ 40 billion.

In 1999, a new framework entered into force, based in the so called the economic policy tripod: 
1)  inflation  targeting  regime;  2)  floating  exchange  rate,  with  high  capital  mobility;  and  3)  primary 
surplus  surplus  targets.  Price  stability  was  pursued  by  fixing  the  basic  interest  rate  according  to  a 
Taylor rule, controlling simultaneously aggregate demand and, though not directly, the exchange rate, 
in line with the NCM. Fiscal policy, in its turn, was kept flat, not to exercise pressures on public debt 
and inflation (through demand). Economic growth was left in a secondary place. 
 
The results of this policy,  still running  nowadays, have  been  far  from  satisfactory. In a  broad 
view,  inflation  was  kept  under  relative  control  in  the  mid  2000’s,  but  presented  a  sort  of  resilience 
impeding the inflation rate to go below a floor limit (Fig. 3). There are two main reasons for that. The 
domestic one is the fact that the practice of price indexation was not eliminated. In fact, relevant prices 
remained indexed to the past inflation, even under the terms of legal rules, such as rents, some  tariffs 
(public transportation, energy, gas, etc.) and the called ‘monitored” prices.

So, any shock on agricultural prices, for instance, would spread to the whole economy. Administrated 
inflation (weighing one third of the general index)13 drove inflation rate until the early 2007. 

The  external  reason  is  the  financialization  of  commodity  markets  (UNCTAD,  2009)  and  the 
emergence of China and India as big importers, commodity prices rose sharply. So, international prices 
contributed  to  put  pressure  in  the  domestic  inflation  along  the  2000’s.Then,  currency  appreciation 
became  the  main  instrument  to  fight  against  ‘imported’  inflation,  compensating  tradable-commodity 
price rises in reais.  

The strategy to control inflation led to two main problems still affecting the performance of EP: 

the high interest rates and the overvaluation of the real. 

                                                             
13 However not all administrated prices are necessarily indexed to past inflation.

2006;  Erber,  2008a,  20008b  and  2011;  Modenesi,  2011;  Oreiro,  2012;  Modenesi  et  al.,  2013b). 
Extremely  high  basic  rates  were  used  to  keep  the  real  overvalued,  what  mostly  explained  the 
slowdown of inflation rates (see, for instance, Araujo and Modenesi, 2013). The conservatism resulted 
from the way BCB conducted the monetary policy, i.e. based on a strictly rigid Taylor rule in line with 
the NCM (see Modenesi et al., 2013b). Brazilian basic interest rate was too high even when compared 
with other developing countries (Table 1).

The  other  problem  was  an  overvalued  exchange  rate:  the  appreciation  of  the  real  was  of  50% 
between end-2002 and 2010 (Fig. 4).The consequent loss of competitiveness (Fig. 5) .led to decreasing 
in the share of industrialized goods in the export basket, and to a process of de-industrialization (See 
Bresser-Pereira, 2010; Carvalho and Kupfer, 2011).

In  sum,  the  tripod  locked  Brazilian  economy  in  a  trap.  Despite  of  the  extremely  high  interest 
rates  and  strong  overvaluation  of  real,  EP  was  not  able  to  maintain  inflation  at  expected  reasonable 
level, and to promote satisfactory economic growth: GDP real rate of growth remained below the long-
term average.

Her are presented the main changes in  fiscal, monetary, financial and foreign exchange  policies 

sheepishly started in the second Lula’s term and becoming more significant under Dilma. 

 

a. Fiscal Policy: fostering investment 
The  pursuit  of  high  primary  fiscal  surplus  targets  did  not  allow  using  fiscal  policy  playing 
countercyclical  role  in  the  whole  period.  In  2003-2006,  a  great  effort  was  done  to  increasing  the 
surplus. Fiscal policy was used to offset the economic downturn following the subprime (2008-9) and 
the Euro crises (2011-2).

Since the second Lula administration, some efforts have been implemented aiming at improving 
public investment levels. In 2007, was launched the “Plano de Aceleração do Crescimento-PAC” (Plan 
for  Growth  Acceleration”),  designed  to  promoting  investments  in  infrastructure  and  public  services. 
The plan was only partially  implemented  being  more  successful  its  “Minha Casa Minha Vida” (“My 
House, My Life”) program that has already built more than 2 million houses. 

In 2011, Dilma inaugurated the “Brasil Maior” Plan, the first industrial policy plan since the end 
of  the  1980s,  aiming  at  fostering  industry  competitiveness  and  stimulating  its  exports.  Its  main 
measures were: restitution of taxes to firms committed to exports; preference to Brazilian producers in 
government’s purchases; financing to R&D activities; and turning immediate the restitutions of taxes 
on capital goods purchases.  

A  more  significant  measure  was  edited  in  2012.  Forty  industrial  sectors,  key  to  Brazilian 
development,  were  benefited  with  a  shift  in  taxation.  They  were  taxed  at  20%  on  their  payroll,  now 
they are taxed at 1.00 to 2.00%, depending on the sector and on their gross revenue. This will represent 
a US$ 6 billion reduction on taxation in 2013, and the elimination of tax burden on employment, what 
is  expected  to  increase  employment  and  boost  competitiveness  in  some  relevant  capital  and  durable 
goods industries. Besides that, in any industry the period of depreciation of capital assets was reduced 
from 10 to 5 years, in order to stimulate the purchase of new equipment and machines and, also, their 
production. The tax exemption due to this rule will amount to US$ 3.4 billion from 2013 to 2017. 

In  August  2012,  Dilma  announced  a  new  version  of  the  PAC  plan  which  lays  down  public 
investment of  US$  66  billion  in  highways  and railways, 40  billion  in the  next 5  years and 26  in the 
next 25 years. To  carry out the  investments and  to regulate the  transport systems, a public enterprise 
was created:  “Empresa de Planejamento Logístico-ELP” (“Company  for  Logistic Planning”). This  is 
Brazilian biggest plan  in transportation, and  it  is expected to build 7,500 km of highways and 10.000 
km of railways, and the bullet train connecting Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The plan is expected to 
reverse the tendency of highway network reducing. 

Furthermore,  electric  energy  prices,  which  were  considered  as  one  of  the  highest  in  the  world, 
were  significantly  reduced:  16.2%  on  home  consumption  and  from  19.7%  to  28%  on  the  industrial 
one.  The  reductions  were  held  through  energy  suppliers  tax  burden  reductions  and  the  extension  of 
their  concession  contracts.  The  government  is  now  working  aiming  at  promoting  similar  process  of 
consumer  price  reduction  in  exchange  of  reduction  on  the  tax  burden  of  supplier  of  gas  and  also  on 
items of the “cesta básica” (a set of basic consumer goods).  

Those  measures  radically  departure  from  the  NCM  amendments.  They  are  in  line  with  the 
structuralist  view  of  inflation  (Noyola,  1956;  Sunkel,  1958).  The  basic  inflationary  pressures  are 
related to structural economic system inflexibilities, as the inelasticity of supply of basic services and 
other inputs of widespread use, including some under oligopolistic condition.

The first signals of changes in the conservative conduction of monetary policy started to be seen 
during the last six months of Lula’s administration. In September 2010, the BCB decided keeping the 
basic  interest  rate  unchanged  (10.75%)  while  inflation  expectations  were  deteriorating  suggesting  an 
inflation  rate  above  the  4.5%  target.  This  decision  was  put  into  force  in  the  October  and  December 
meeting of the Committee of Monetary Policy board, when alternative measures started being taken. 

Two main measures were taken. First, reserve requirements  on deposits were raised to work as 
an alternative instrument to the interest rate in  moderating the observed growth of aggregate demand, 
in order to control inflation. 

Second,  for  the  first  time  the  BCB’s  Counsil  of  Monetary  Policy  (Copom)  started  adopting 
macro-prudential  measures  (set  by  the  Basel  Accord)  by  enhancing  capital  requirements  on  loans  to 
individuals,  especially,  those  for  buying  vehicles.  However,  the  ascendant  path  of  inflation  and 
inflation expectations did  not  cease.  Then,  the BCB rose the basic  interest rate  five times  in the  first 
half of 2011. 

In  august  2011,  the  BCB  decided  cutting  the  basic  rate  from  12.5%  to  12.0%  despite  of  the 
raising of  both  inflation  rate,  and  inflation expectations prevailing  in the  financial  market.14 This  has 
been  the  first  time  under  the  inflation  targeting  regime  that  the  BCB  has  not  followed  the  financial 
market  consensus,  provoking  doubts  as:  have  the  Taylor  rule  parameters  changed?  Was  inflation 
targeting  being  abandoned?  More  than  that,  decision  triggered  rather  virulent  reactions  from  the 
financial market player, expressed through the media (Modenesi et al., 2012). 

Figure 8: Figure 8: Basic Interest Rate (Selic) 

 

Source: BCB, the bar refers to Lehman Brothers collapse. 

 

 
The  Copom  cut the  Selic  rate  in  eight  subsequent  meetings  (Figure  8),  making  it  achieving  its 
lowest  level  since  ever  its  creation,  7.5%,  right  a  year  after  the  first  cut.  So,  Brazil  scaled  down  the 
world ranking of  basic  rates from the 9th position to the 19th position, aligning  its  basic rate with the 
levels prevailing in other developing countries. 

Thereby,  one  can  state  that  the  BCB’s  approach  on  monetary  policy  changed,  mainly  after 
August  2011.  Nowadays,  to  control  inflation  the  BCB  has  at  hand  the  macro-prudential  framework 
which can be used to pursue its main goal, when and whether it decided to do so. 

 
c. Financial policy 
The 2008  international  crisis affected Brazilian financial and capital markets performance  – but 
not  the  soundness  of  the  financial  system.  Private  bank  drastically  reduced  the  rhythm  of  loan 
concessions, as shown in Figure 9. Immediately, public commercial and development banks (bold line) 
aggressively expanded their pace of lending granting in order to reestablish the flows of resources for

(“Focus”).

around 5% in 12 months, public credit was increasing at a 30-35% rate. As a result, the share of these 
institutions in the credit market rose from 34.1% to 45.5% (Figure 10). 

A second round of countercyclical action started in the end of 2011 and gained momentum in the 
first quarter of 2012 (Figure 9). This  new round of public credit expansion represented an attempt to 
restoring consumption and economic activity levels, amid the economic slowdown. 

The  role  of  the  two  main  public  banks  was  redesigned:  Banco  do  Brasil  (BB)  and  Caixa 
Econômica Federal (CEF) started a crusade in favor of lower spreads, in April 2012. These institutions 
cut  their  interest  rates,  pressing  private  banks  to  do  the  same.  After  some  resistance  of  the  biggest 
private banks, spreads started to decrease as well as interest rates for clients. As shown in Table 2, BB 
and CEF cut around 4.0 percentage points in the spread of their main credit lines whilst  bigger banks 
as Itaú Unibanco cut 8.0 p.p. and Bradesco 2.5 p.p. on loans to individuals15. According to President 
Dilma  in  a recent  interview  for Financial Times,  “Brazil  was the  last  free  lunch  in the world  for the 
banks”.

Financial  policies  were  not  restrained  to  credit  market.  There  is  a  clear  attempt  to  create  and 
develop  a  long-term  capital  market,  especially  a  long-term  corporate  bond  market.  The  government 
passed  a  law  in  2011  that:  (i)  set  tax  incentives  for  foreigners  invest  in  long-term  bonds,  and  to 
domestic and foreign investors to  invest in infrastructure debentures16; (ii) creates a special category 
of  investment  funds:  research,  development  and  innovation  investment  funds;  (iii)  improvements  on 
infrastructure  investment  funds;  (iv)  eased  conditions  for  issuers  of  debentures  and  financial  bonds 
(ANBIMA, 2011b and 2011c; Freitas, 2011). 

This measure was complemented by a joint initiative from BNDES and  Associação (ANBIMA) 
called New Market for Fixed Income (NMFI), which resembles the BM&FBovespa New Market, and 
establishes differentiated corporate governance  levels  in the bond  market. The adherence to NMFI  is 
not  mandatory  but  adds  a  kind  of  quality  stamp  to  bonds  issued  under  its  rules.  These  rules  include 
special  conditions  for  terms,  repurchase  (allowed  only  12  months  after  the  issue),  remuneration 
(banning  indexation  to  Selic)  etc.  Besides  that,  they  include  “a  set  of  measures  aiming  at  support 
secondary market liquidity.” (IMF, 2012b: 50).  

Lastly and still regarding a  long-term capital  market, the structure of public debt remuneration 
has  been  changing  in  favor of  pre-fixed  bonds  ,  which  now  is  the  main  component  and  answers  for 
40%  of  the  total  (Fig.  11)  public  debt.  Bonds  with  indexation  to  Selic  –  which  actually  reduces  the 
bond’s  duration  to  zero  with  no  risk  discouraging  private  issuances  –  had  its  share  reduced  in  30 
percentage points 

In  sum,  together  with  the  new  measures  of  monetary  policy,  this  measure  helps  establishing  a 
benchmark for private long-term issues and eliminates the high-yield-no-risk condition of public bonds 
and the consequent unfair competition among these bonds and the private ones.

All  the  measures  described  in  this  section  points  to  a  deliberate  attempt  of  the  Brazilian 
government  to  improving  the  functionality  of  the  Brazilian  financial  system  aiming  at  financing 
economic development. Lower bank spreads and tariffs facilitate the access to credit and contribute to 
the soundness of the system  from the  financial  fragility  standpoint. A long-term capital  market helps 
corporations funding their investments, improving the conditions for economic growth. However, one 
relevant  caveat  applies  to  the  strategy  designed  for  the  capital  market:  there  is  a  great  reliance  on 
foreign investors in developing this market, which has proved to be problematic in other occasions due 
to the volatility  and pro-cyclicality of  foreign capital  flows, as has already  happened  in the Brazilian 
stock market (Hermann and Montani Martins, 2012). 

 
 
 
d. Exchange rate policy and capital controls 

After many years being considered undesirable capital control measures were once again used in 
Brazil in 2008. Massive inflow of short term foreign capital was appreciating too much the real. Then, 
a 2% rate of the IOF (a tax on financial transactions) was imposed to nonresident portfolio equity and 
debt inflows. 

The  crisis  came  and  appreciation  stopped,  but  in  2010,  with  the  rebound  of  economic  growth 
(7.5% GDP growth) and,  mainly, after  monetary  expansion  in developed countries (e.g., quantitative 
easing and operation twist in the U.S.), capital inflows accelerated once again, amounting to US$141 
billion (6.8% of 2010 GDP). The rate of  IOF was tripled  from 2% to  6%  but  it was not sufficient to 
stop the appreciation of the real, as the IMF (2011: 35) diagnosed:  

[e]mpirical  evidence  suggests  that  the  IOF  measures  did  not  have  a  clear,  long-lasting  effect  on  the 
exchange  rate—at  least  relative  to  its  level  at  the  time  the  various  IOF  measures  were  introduced.  This 
may  have been  due to the fact that the  introduction  of the IOF  did  not trigger a significant reduction  in 
nonresidents’ positioning in the futures market.” (IMF, 2011: 35). 
 
So,  Finance  Ministry  started  releasing  several  measures,  intensifying  capital  controls  and 
spreading them into several markets. The most important, taken in 2011, was the imposition of 1% of 
IOF on exposures  in  FX  future derivatives betting against  real (in  line with IMF’s diagnosis).  It  was 
improved  and  fine-tuned  by  three  changes  in  end-February  and  March,  2012,  when  the  Real  rose  to 
around R$ 2.00/US$. Figure 12 illustrates the path of Brazilian exchange rate with bars indicating the 
days when changes in IOF were introduced. Figure 13 shows the liquid position on exchange contracts 
signed for financial purposes (blue bars refer to the period after the futures derivatives measure).

There  are  two  divergent  diagnoses  regarding  Brazilian  industry  bad  performance  in  the  recent 
years.  According to the first one, a deindustrialization process has been  in course, a Brazilian version 
of the ‘Dutch disease’ (Bresser-Pereira, 2010). The other one stresses the premature specialization of 
Brazilian  industry,  due  to  the  poor  macroeconomic  performance  and  to  the  appreciation  of  the  real 
(Carvalho  and  Kupfer,  2011).  Nevertheless,  the  supporters  of  both  agree  that  an  R$  2.00/US$ 
exchange rate – rather than an R$ 1.60/US$ - contributes to improve the competitiveness of Brazilian 
enterprises internationally.  

Capital  controls  were  brought  again  to  the  center  of  the  agenda.  The  actual  Brazilian  finance 
minister, Guido Mantega, publicly stated that Brazil is prone to  use capital controls and intensify the 
existing controls if necessary. This statement was made after the Federal Reserve announced the third 
round of quantitative easing, showing that new measures could  be taken to make up for the effects of 
the FED monetary expansionist policies, establishing what he called the currency war.  

 
4. The Economic Policy Recent Change: gattopardo change and no new development 
convention 

 
The ample set of measures timidly started being put into force under Lula since 2007, especially 
the  ones  edited  by  President  Dilma’s,  may  suggest  that  the  previous  orthodox  economic  policy  – 
prioritizing inflation control using the interest rate as its basic tool – has given place to a “new”, more 
flexible policy, enriched by the diversification of means and goals.

reasonable  supposing  this  impression  sounds  rather  correct.  After  all,  changes  spread  throughout  all 
spectra  of  EP,  i.e.  fiscal,  financial,  of  exchange  rate  and  foreign  capital  control,  and  even  in  the 
monetary policy, the corn stone of the current EP. The main differences between the  macroeconomic 
frameworks of 1999-2006 and 2007-2013 are illustrated by the schemes below.  

In one hand, inflation control count on wider set of instruments, such as macro-prudential tools, 
tax exemptions (in energy and food), used in addition to the monetary policy. On the other hand, fiscal 
policy  started  being  used  to  somehow  sustain  demand.  Even  monetary  policy  seemed  to  have  been 
changed in a way: the interest rate has been kept in more reasonable levels helping sustaining demand, 
signaling it was not focusing price stability at any cost. 

Financial stability has also become an explicit objective, to be accomplished by means of macro-
prudential  tools.  The  system  of  loans  (short or  long-term)  was  shifted  increasing  the  share  of  public 
and  development  banks  aiming  stressing  competition  in  order  to  reduce  spreads;  and  some  other 
measures were adopted to foster long-term capital markets.  

Lastly, the exchange rate policy  started counting  on capital  controlling  measures  in the  face of 
massive  entrance  of  short  term  foreign  capital  appreciating  the  real  by  taxing  nonresident  portfolio 
equity and debt inflows.

 Can one properly affirm that, eventually, a new economic policy (EP) regime was introduced in 
Brazil?  And  so  did  the  EP  change  provide  the  basis  for  the  building  up  of  a  new  development 
convention?  

To accurately answer the first question it would be helpful to recourse to the concept of gattopardo 
change:  “gattopardo  constitutes  change  that  keeps  things  the  same”  (Palley,  2013:1).  The  concept  was 
proposed by Palley, who named it after the Luchino Visconti’s Il Gattopardo (The Leopard), a film based 
on the novel by Giuseppe di Lampedusa about the revolutionary rising of the bourgeoisie in Sicily.in the

In the story, an aristocrat character concludes that “things  must change  if they are to remain the 
same”. And the  movie shows that “after the revolution, the old aristocracy remains in charge, allied via 
marriage with the new urban elite.” (Palley, 2013: ibid). The  same  happens with economists that, given 
the failure of the orthodox theory, suggest perfunctory changes in its framework.  

Palley’s concept fits as a glove to qualify the change in the Brazilian EP. 
The  answer to the  first  above question  is definitely  – and unfortunately,  in our view  –  no. The 
hard  core  of  the  actual  EP  remains  the  very  same:  inflation  targeting;  floating  exchange  rate;  and 
primary budget surplus targeting. Essentially, inflation controlling remains its prime goal, and interest 
rate is the mean to achieve it. As a matter of fact, the measures taken in second Lula’s term and under 
Dilma was cosmetic preserving EP’s essence. It was in two words gattopardo change. 

And now, what about the second above question: a new DC? 
As Erber proposed, “a development convention is concerned with structural change. This begs 
the  question  about  which  ‘structures’  are  to  be  changed?  The  answer  to  that  question  differentiates 
development conventions”. 

So, it is really troublesome arguing that the recent change in Brazilian EP, meaning gattopardo 
change, can be taken as the basis for constituting a very agenda – in the sense in which it  is used in 
Erber’s  conceptualization  of  DC  –  as  required  for  the  social-political  process  of  formation  of  any 
hegemonic DC. In short: the stability convention still remains ruling in Brazil.  
 
5. Final Remarks 

Two development  conventions  have  been  disputing  hegemony  in Brazil:  a pro-growth  – state 
led and  a pro-stability – free market  conventions. From the  WW II till the end of the 1970, the  first 
was dominant. With the surge of liberalism worldwide and the  final exit of inflation control from the 
mid 1990’s on with the Real Plan, the stability convention conquer  hegemony that was reinforced by 
the adoption in 1999 of an EP focused in inflation targeting.  

This policy resulted in low growth; high interest rates; relatively high inflation; and overvalued 
currency,  but  until  the  2008  global  financial  crisis, the  stability  convention  had  unquestionably  been 
hegemonic.  

In  the  second  Lula’s  term,  most  properly  under  Dilma,  there  have  been  some  non-orthodox 
measures. Surely, some of them were taken with the concern to keep demand level and so the growing 
of  GDP. However, the fiscal  policy  was  not  made  a permanent  countercyclical  instrument. Thus, the 
change did not mean an inflexion in the EP towards a Keynesian one, as proposed by some. 

More broadly  speaking, those shifts  were  too  perfunctory  to constitute  a genuine  change  in the 
EP. In  fact, the economic  tripod policy was  left entirely  preserved, remaining  inflation control as  its 
permanent  goal  and  the  interest  rate  as  the  instrument  to  achieve  it.  So,  the  change  did  not  really 
change the EP. It was true gattopardo change. 

Nevertheless,  this  does  not  mean  that  it  had  no  consequence  at  all.  On  one  hand,  it  helped  to 
somehow turn more bearable some of EP’s bad effects. On the other, it tends to contribute masking the 
very orthodox nature of the EP. 

It is not reasonable arguing that the recent change in Brazilian EP, meaning gattopardo change, 
can fulfil the necessary conditions to constitute a DC whether  it does not provide even a real agenda. 
Without it, it is senseless speculating about teleology, social-political supporting etc. 

Besides  that,  the  rising  of  a  new  hegemonic  DC  is  now  highly  unlike  for  the  stability 
convention’s  power  is  outstandingly  as  strong  as  ever.  Evidence  which  those  who  expect  the 
enthroning of a new one should recognize  

In  sum:  for  very  ponderable  reasons  it  is  not  wise  proposing  the  complex  social  process  of 

forming a hegemonic DC is to be surge in the foreseeing future.
