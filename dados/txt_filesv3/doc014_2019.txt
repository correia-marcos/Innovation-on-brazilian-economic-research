Robert Torrens, the Quantitative Method and the General 

Glut Controversy 

Rogério Arthmar and Taro Hisamatsu* 

This paper analyzes Robert Torrens’s statement of Say’s Law and the possible causes of economic 
distress based on the concept of a proportionate demand. Initially, we exam Torrens’s thoughts on 
the  best  way  of  doing  economics,  showing  how  he  opted  for  a  full-blown  deductive  method  to 
conduct  his  inquiries  into  political  economy,  but  always  anchored  on  a  quantitative  approach. 
Following that, his basic aggregate model for equilibrium prices and the profit rate is presented. 
Next, his proportional theory of Say’s Law is described and articulated with a numerical illustration 
to exemplify how the correct supply of capital ingredients is taken by him as a necessary condition 
for the equilibrium of markets and also as a counterargument to Thomas R. Malthus’ case for the 
general glut. The subsequent section considers the possible causes of a shortage in effectual demand 
and how it can quickly engulf the whole economy. The quantitative illustration developed by Torrens 
is reviewed on its effects on the transactions of the different economic sectors and synthesized in a 
disequilibrium  matrix  of  exchanges.  The  final  comments  stress  the  originality  of  Torrens’s 
theoretical contribution to the general glut controversy, marked by a peculiar numerical approach to 
economic theory. 

Key  words:  classical  methodology,  quantitative  approach,  competitive  equilibrium,  effectual

O artigo analisa a formulação proposta por Robert Torrens para a Lei de Say e as possíveis causas 
de saturação geral com base no conceito de demanda proporcional. Inicialmente, examinam-se as 
ideias de Torrens relativas à melhor maneira de pensar a economia, mostrando como ele optou por 
um método essencialmente dedutivo para conduzir suas investigações em economia política, mas 
sempre apoiado num método quantitativo. A seguir, o seu modelo básico de preços de equilíbrio e 
da taxa de lucro é apresentado. Ainda, a sua teoria da Lei de Say baseada no conceito de proporções 
é descrita e articulada com uma ilustração numérica a fim de ilustrar como o correto suprimento do 
capital é considerado por Torrens como condição necessária ao equilíbrio dos mercados e também 
como contra-argumento às teses de Thomas R. Malthus sobre as crises de saturação geral. A seção 
seguinte considera as causas de uma deficiência localizada na demanda efetiva e como tal situação 
pode englobar toda a economia. O exemplo numérico desenvolvido por Torrens é revisto em seus 
efeitos  sobre  as  transações  dos  diferentes  setores  e  sintetizado  numa  matriz  de  trocas  em 
desequilíbrio. Os comentários finais realçam a originalidade da contribuição teórica de Torrens ao 
debate sobre os mercados, marcada por um tratamento numérico peculiar da teoria econômica.

1.  Introduction 

Reconstructions  of  pioneer  inroads  into  mathematical  economics  during  the  early  19th 
century have found that those attempts consisted mainly in applying calculus, basic algebra 
or  geometry  to problems such  as  gambling, the  optimal amount  of taxation, or  even the 
proper balance among productive sectors (Theocharis 1993: 3–18; Robertson 1949; Jevons 
1879: x–l). The group of intellectuals organized around William Whewell (1794–1866) at 
Cambridge,  for  instance,  sought  to  scrutinize  many  aspects  of  Ricardian  economics  via 
mathematical and inductive methods (Theocharis 1993: 104–47; Henderson 1985; Strong 
1955). This specific way of doing science conformed better to the Newtonian tradition of 
empirical  knowledge that  had  been  nurturing  many  British  classical  economists,  at  least 
until David Ricardo entered the scene. After the Napoleonic Wars, however, the prospect of 
building a completely deductive political economy seemed more promising than Whewell’s 
or Thomas Robert Malthus’s contrary claims, given the scarcity of reliable economic data 
and adequate instruments to extract relevant information from them.1 

One significant event on this score is that Ricardo was not by himself in his endeavor 
to create a purely abstract political economy bent on numerical analysis.2 At the same time, 
Colonel Robert Torrens was developing a similar procedure with even greater conviction in 
his  writings  on  economic  theory.  In  fact,  Torrens  managed  to  elaborate  a  process  of 
numerical determination of competitive prices and the profit rate for various branches of 
economic activity that would be proven immensely valuable in sharpening his arguments 
on several theoretical issues. Furthermore, he tirelessly pursued the logical implications of 
his  elucubrations  to  the  point  of  challenging  his  peers  with  unparallel  confidence.  The 
fortunate aspect of his combative personality lies in the circumstance that Torrens, amid 
many controversies, ended up originating fundamental propositions that marked his work 
as unique among the constellation of classical economists. One of the most notable results 
of his mental exertions was the idea of a proportionate growth of the elements of capital as 
a necessary condition for the prevalence of Say’s Law.  

Notwithstanding  the  able  accounts  of  Torrens’s  wavering  thoughts  on  the 
equilibrium of aggregate markets (Kates 1998: 36–40; Sowell 1972: 129–31; Corry 1962: 
99–100),  they  neglect  the  specificity  of  his  methodological  stance,  and  even  the  direct 
connection of his strictures with his peculiar quantitative approach to economic theory. This 
article seeks to offer a more comprehensive treatment of these coexisting aspects of Torren’s 
analytical  work.  For  such,  the  following  section  deals  with  Torrens’s  deductive 
methodological  standpoint.  Section  three presents  his  quantitative approach  to  economic 
theory. Section four links the arguments set forth in the previous sections with Torrens’s 
views on Say’s Law and effectual demand. Lastly, section five goes through his diagnostic 
                                                           
1 Malthus was not an outright critic of deductive methods, although he indicated the limitations of Ricardian 
economics due to the erratic behavior of human passions, the risk of oversimplification in the study of complex 
phenomena, and the existence of exceptions to general laws in social sciences. Malthus also disagreed with 
the  inductivists  due  to  their  unwillingness  to  follow  a  middle-ground  between  the  two  extreme  positions 
(Cremaschi and Dascal 1998; Redman 1993: 259–320; De Marchi and Sturges 1973).  

2  Ricardo’s  contribution  has  never  been  taken  as  a  concerted  effort  at  expressing  economic  truths  in 
mathematical terms, despite modern translations of it into a system of simultaneous equations (Kurz 2015; 
Garegnani 1987; Pasinetti 1960; for a critical assessment of such approach, see Peach 2009: 277–86). But in 
the Principles  of Political Economy and Taxation, most  notably in its  first and second  editions, one  finds 
several  numerical cases conceived  to offer the reader a quantitative path across a rather sinuous theory  of 
exchangeable-values (Ricardo [1817–21] 1951: 56–63; Cochrane 1970; Wilson & Pate 1968; St. Clair 1965: 
20–35).

his  case.  The  closing  remarks  stress  the  originality  of  Torrens’s  so-called  illustrative 
approach to classical economics. 
 

2.  Torrens’s methodology of economics 

Biographical sketches of Torrens’s career at the Royal Marines, the infantry branch of the 
British  Royal  Navy,  are  few  and  revolve  around  either  his  brave  repelling  of  a  Danish 
invasion of the Anholt island in 1811 or his longwinded quarrel with superiors over his rank 
and pay (Moore 2004; Fetter 1990, 1962). Torrens entered service as an ensign of the Royal 
Navy in February 1796, at 16 years of age. He was promoted to first lieutenant by the end 
of the following year, to Captain in 1806, and finally deployed to Anholt in 1810. He would 
fight other great battles during the Napoleonic Wars, retiring from the Royal Marines in 
1834 as a major. Frank W. Fetter (1962) has argued that Torrens’s military mind strongly 
influenced  his  economic  policy  propositions  since  he  was  always  ready  to  prioritize 
Britain’s  interests  on  issues  involving  other  nations,  contrary  to  his  contemporary  free 
traders.  However,  there  is  another  side  of  Torrens’s  military  life  worth  of  attention  and 
related to the development of his intellectual skills during his initial years in active duty.  

In 1677, a Royal Proclamation established a mandatory examination for promotion 
to  lieutenancy  within  the  Royal  Navy,  when  the  young  candidates  should  confirm  their 
proficiency in seamanship and navigation. The usual manner of obtaining adequate learning 
to the exam during the 18th century was through teachers in small private navigation schools 
or sea-going instructors. An Admiralty Order of Council from 1702 set a modest payment 
to anyone proven able and willing to be a schoolmaster at sea in charge of educating young 
gentlemen  in  the  theoretical  and  practical  aspects  of  navigation.  The  scheme,  however, 
seems  to  have  been  somehow  deficient  since  the  schoolmasters  had  to  continuously 
scramble  for  teaching  time  amid  the  sailors’  busy  daily  routine.  In  1733  the  Admiralty 
inaugurated the Portsmouth Naval Academy, an institution composed of highly qualified 
and well-paid headmasters and staff. Despite the substantial investment, the establishment 
never reached a satisfactory number of students, probably due to the long-held belief among 
experienced officers that the right way of learning about navigation was at sea (Scott 2011: 
54–72). This understanding finally prevailed, and the Academy was shut down in 1837. Of 
interest  here  is  the  circumstance  that,  together  with  military  and  navigation  skills,  the 
program of studies at the institution displayed a robust mathematical content. As observed 
by naval historian Harry Dickinson: 

The student’s progress was recorded in an individual Plan of Learning, a sizeable and heavy 
notebook,  extensively  illustrated  and  sub  divided  into  the  sections  of  the  syllabus. 
Fortunately a number of these have survived and provide a detailed record of the subjects 
followed,  namely:  arithmetic,  geometry,  spherical  geometry,  trigonometry,  geography, 
astronomy, navigation, fortification and gunnery. In a typical Plan of Learning each subject 
merited  a  separate  chapter  and  each  of  these  followed  a  similar  pattern  starting  with  a 
statement  of  relative  definitions  and  then  proceeding  rather  laboriously  through  a  list  of 
worked examples (Dickinson 2007: 35). 

Most likely, Torrens did not attend the Academy, for there are indications he was often 
boarded during his first years at the Navy (Moore 2004). But schoolmasters’ manuals from 
the 18th century covered the same ground as the Academy. Among the most famous, Mango 
Murray’s The Rudiments of Navigation, published in 1760, was made up of six chapters, 
comprising,  respectively:  proportions  and  logarithms;  geometry  and  trigonometry; 

 

3 

trigonometrical  and  logarithmical  tables;  spherical  geometry;  Mercator’s  chart  and  the 
measurement of distances; and lastly, astronomy and the use of David’s quadrant. The book 
is  compact  but  filled  with  numerical  illustrations  and  many  rather  intricate  problems. 
Perhaps  the  most  serious  task  for  a  young  officer  was  the  so-called  “working  the  day’s 
work”, that is, calculating the course and distance sailed each day by the ship (Murray 1760: 
103–11).3 One way or another, via the Academy or sea-going masters, we can safely assume 
that,  in  his  early  years  in  the  Navy,  Torrens  got  very  much  acquainted  with  arithmetic, 
proportions, trigonometry, logarithms and geometry, as well with the resolution of generic 
problems on these fields related to nautical abilities.4 

There  are  not  many  writings  by  Torrens  on  methodological  issues.  In  the  short 
preface to his 1821 Essay on the Production of Wealth, he advocates the adoption of a mixed 
methodology for economics, something in between the Ricardian and Malthusian methods, 
both  of  which  he  judged  as  incomplete.  Torrens  felt  that  Ricardo  was  always  prone  to 
generalize without empirical support, whereas Malthus pushed his reflections all the way to 
the opposite end, conferring excessive weight to particulars without putting forth any trace 
of  an  abstract  theory  (Torrens  1821:  iii–iv).  What  Torrens  understood  as  the  essential 
empirical  touch  to  economic  analysis  at  this  stage  of  his  career  was,  however,  far  from 
satisfying more sophisticated philosophers in search of a real-world basis for science. For 
Torrens, empirical support meant exactly numerical illustrations of abstract thoughts, and 
he did not spare the reader from going through a plethora of numbers over his 1821 book. 
When  addressing  complaints  about  his  characteristic  excessive  appeal  to  quantitative 
arguments, which he called “demonstrative”, the answer came as follows: 

The science of Political Economy is analogous to the mixed mathematics. The data upon 
which it proceeds are furnished by observation and experience;  while the conclusions to 
which it leads, are attained by a process of ratiocination self-evident in all its steps. To give 
this  science,  therefore,  the  exactness  and  certainty  of  which  it  is  susceptible,  it  must  be 
presented under the analytical and demonstrative form (Torrens 1821: x). 

Over time, Torrens’s thoughts about economic methodology definitely leaned to the abstract 
side after 1821. In an extensive introduction to his voluminous The Budget, published in 
1844, one finds an interesting digression on what should be the most appropriate nature of 
economic reasoning. The book consists of several letters to politicians composed in previous 
years, and its chief goal is to prove, via a highly hypothetical trade pattern between England 
and Cuba, that reciprocity in tariffs, instead of unilateral free trade, would be the optimal 
commercial  policy  for  the  British  Empire.  According  to  Torrens,  Ricardo’s  theory  of 
exchangeable values was conceived to explain domestic trade, where capital and labor were 
fully  transferable  among  economic  sectors  to  equalize  the  profit  rates  when  changes  in 
supply and demand, production costs, and taxes are observed. That, however, is hardly the 
case when the analysis moves to an international dimension and there is little mobility of 
people and capital across national boundaries (Torrens 1844: v–viii). 

                                                           
3  Other  18th  century  manuals  from  well-known  schoolmasters  such  as  William  Jones’s  1702  A  New 
Compendium on the Whole Art of Practical Navigation and John Collier’s 1729 Compendium Artis Nauticae 
have contents equivalent to Murray’s. 

4 How much importance Torrens attached to military education can be inferred by a letter from James Mill to 
Ricardo, dated October 26, 1818 (Ricardo [1816–18] 1952: 313–18), where it is reported that Torrens was 
deeply worried about one of his sons being “too idle to get knowledge enough to pass” the exam at the Royal 
Military College, Bagshot. James Mill had enrolled the young John Mill there to attend a two-week course on 
Chemistry.

As  the  conditions  of  supply  and  demand  in  international  trade  are  constantly 
changing, says Torrens, conclusions about the most suitable commercial policy can be found 
either by inductive or deductive methods. When following the former one, the economist 
will look over the statistics of trade, for instance, between French wine and British yarns, 
and  find  that  the  imposition  or  remission  of  duties  affects  the  quantities  and  the 
exchangeable  values  of  both  commodities.  On  the  one  hand,  such  conclusion  does  not 
specify the several channels whereby these effects will manifest themselves; on the other, 
no information is  gained about the intensity that  the new tariff  will have over trade and 
values. These limitations, though, do not apply to the deductive method. Its key advantage, 
argues Torrens, comes from the possibility of estimating the exact consequences personal 
interest will have upon producers and costumers after, for instance, the imposition of a duty. 
Furthermore, the relationship thus obtained would be valid not only in abstract, but also in 
the factual world if the economist were prudent enough to introduce modified assumptions 
to conform one’s theory to alternative scenarios. “Hypothesis is to economical science what 
experiment is to physical science” (Torrens 1844: l). 

In other words, Torrens is arguing that by purely mental operations – by changing 
the premises –, one can build abstract experiments at will in political economy. From this 
perspective, the outcome of every cause acting upon an economic phenomenon could be 
isolated much more precisely than by the induction method, since multiple forces are always 
concurrently exercising their influence over social events. Historical and empirical critics 
of  Ricardian  economics  were  all  in  the  wrong,  claims  Torrens.  They  had  mistakenly 
expected from Ricardo’s theory of profits a conformity with an environment distinct from 
the one he based his predictions on, but without ever conceding the necessity of adjusting 
their own assumptions to fit the changed surroundings they were working with. Once this 
provision is accepted, observes Torrens (1844: xxxviii) with a touch of irony, all economists 
could  be  considered  Ricardian.  Thus,  the  only  way  through  the  maze  of  ever-changing 
conditions  in  the  social  world,  e.g.,  when  dealing  with  the  determinants  of  supply  and 
demand in political economy, was to boldly ratiocinate in terms of fixed quantities as the 
best approximation to a real situation. 

The  mathematician,  finding  no  perfect  lines,  squares,  and  circles  in  nature,  is  obliged  to 
assume  their  existence  as  the  basis  of  his  reasonings;  and,  in  like  manner,  the  Political 
Economist, finding that in the actual circumstances of society the quantities of commodities 
offered in exchange for each other are in a constant state of fluctuation, is obliged to assume 
the existence of definite quantities, in order to arrive at definite conclusions (Torrens 1844: 
xlvii). 

But  Torrens  does  not  intend  to  find  general  propositions  on  political  economy  and, 
consequently,  on  economic  policy,  either  by  the  development  of  pure  syllogisms  or  by 
means of functional relations or algebraic equations. Instead, he chooses the application of 
what  he  calls  “illustrative  cases”,  framed  in  terms  of  numerical  examples,  to  achieve 
progress in economic knowledge. How to leave from one specific point and get to another, 
that  is,  a  procedure  akin  to  working  the  day’s  work  is  how  Torrens  handles  in  a  single 
process theoretical and, therefore, practical problems of economic nature. Thus, having seen 
how  he  conceived  the  best  route  to  make  progress  in  political  economy,  we  may  now 
proceed with the exam of his quantitative framework to deal with issues related to prices, 
profits and capital accumulation. 
 

3.  A basic model of general equilibrium 

 

5 

The  main  weapon  employed  by  Torrens  in  his  disquisitions  on  value  and  capital 
accumulation consisted in his circular model of the economy, where both prices and the 
profit rate are simultaneously determined for a certain productive structure. The foundation 
for this approach lies in Adam Smith’s analysis of how the division of labor works within a 
market-oriented society, articulating several interdependent productive branches in a single 
whole (Torrens 1821: iii, 20, 38). It did take Torrens some time and effort to master the 
technique, but once he got there, he did not spare ammunition. The first attempt already 
appears  in  his  anonymously  published  article  on  “Mr.  Owen’s  Plan  for  Relieving  the 
National Distress”, which despite having its authorship questioned by some scholars, can be 
safely assigned to Torrens.5 The reason lies on the numerical model presented in the article, 
still in very crude form, wherewith the profit rate is directly calculated as a ratio between 
the material expenditures on production as advances to workers and the final output in terms 
of corn and clothing. As the surplus of both commodities bear the same proportion to their 
total respective input in both sectors, no prices are needed to ascertain the common profit 
rate as a physical quotient. Although still crude, this approach immediately allows Torrens 
to specify the determinants of the overall profit rate as, first, the quality of the soil under 
cultivation; second, the efficiency of labor in both agriculture and the manufactures, and, 
lastly, the real wage paid as advances to laborers (Torrens 1819: 454–57). 

The following year, in the second and very much enlarged edition of his Essay on 
the  External  Corn  Trade,  firstly  published  in  1815,  Torrens  admits  the  existence  of  an 
opposition between wages and profits, which he had not thoroughly considered previously, 
alerting  the  reader  in  the  preface  that  Ricardo’s  theory  now  pervades  the  whole  book 
(Torrens  1820:  xx).  What  the  added  pages  show  is  that  Torrens  had  now  successfully 
managed to calculate competitive prices for his productive structure even under the more 
complicated case when the physical surplus is different among the productive sectors. He 
clearly feels very much enthusiastic about this breakthrough and reels off 24 illustrations of 
his model (Torrens 1820: 350–412). Although quite novel and thought-provoking from a 
purely  analytical  standpoint,  the  whole  argument  is  in  no  small  measure  hard  to  follow 
because  of  the  unfortunate  descriptive  and  tiresome  form  of  presentation  adopted  by 
Torrens,  which  quickly  bores  even  the  most  sympathetic  reader.  Regardless,  a  single 
example will be enough to provide the drift of his quantitative views on value and capital 
accumulation.  

Consider 𝑥(cid:3036)(cid:3037) as the quantity of commodity 𝑖 used as an input, in the form of advances 
to labor, and  𝑗 the respective sector of production (denoted by  𝑆(cid:3037));  𝑦(cid:3036)(cid:3037) is also given and 
represents the output of commodity 𝑖 in sector 𝑗; 𝑝(cid:3036) is unknown and denotes the price of 
commodity 𝑖, whereas 𝑟 is also unknown and represents the common profit rate, with 𝑖, 𝑗 =
1, 2, … , 𝑛 during an ordinary production cycle.6 Competition prevails all around and each 

                                                           
5 The authorship of the Edinburgh Review article is a matter of contention. Dennis O’Brien & Adrian Darnell 
(1980), Peter Gronewegen (1993: vi, xvii–xix) and others attributed the work to Torrens. Jacob Viner (1937: 
194) thought it was written by John Ramsey McCulloch. William Thweatt (1980) proposed joint authorship. 
The controversy reached a resolution of sorts with evidence offered by Giancarlo de Vivo in a passage written 
by McCulloch in The Scotsman: “The greater part of a speech made by Colonel Torrens at a public meeting 
in London is incorporated in the excellent article on Mr. Owen’s plans, furnished by that gentleman for the 
64th number of the Edinburgh Review” (quoted from De Vivo 2000: vi).  
6 When fixed capital is introduced as a component 𝑥(cid:3036)(cid:3037), its residual value at the end of the productive cycle may 
be added to its respective output 𝑝(cid:3036)𝑦(cid:3036)(cid:3037): “[W]hen capitals equal in amount, but of different degrees of durability, 
are employed, the articles produced, together with the residue of capital, in one occupation, will be equal in

sector  produces  a  single  𝑦(cid:3037)(cid:3037)  good.  Then,  Torrens’s  system  may  be  represented  by  the 
following array of equations: 

(𝑝(cid:2869)𝑥(cid:2869)(cid:2869) + 𝑝(cid:2870)𝑥(cid:2870)(cid:2869) + ⋯ + 𝑝(cid:3041)𝑥(cid:3041)(cid:2869))(1 + 𝑟) = 𝑝(cid:2869)𝑦(cid:2869)(cid:2869)
(𝑝(cid:2869)𝑥(cid:2869)(cid:2870) + 𝑝(cid:2870)𝑥(cid:2870)(cid:2870) + ⋯ + 𝑝(cid:3041)𝑥(cid:3041)(cid:2870))(1 + 𝑟) = 𝑝(cid:2870)𝑦(cid:2870)(cid:2870)

⋮

(𝑝(cid:2869)𝑥(cid:2869)(cid:3041) + 𝑝(cid:2870)𝑥(cid:2870)(cid:3041) + ⋯ + 𝑝(cid:3041)𝑥(cid:3041)(cid:3041))(1 + 𝑟) = 𝑝(cid:3041)𝑦(cid:3041)(cid:3041)

(cid:3426)

Torrens never laid out his examples in a mathematical setting like above, but it will be shown 
that system (1) is what he really had in mind when talking about prices and Say’s Law.7 At 
this  point  we  should  stress  that  this  intellectual  construction  must  be  considered  a  real 
landmark in British classical economics, even in view of the scanty attention it received at 
the time. Such structure is indeed a nonlinear system with 𝑛 equations, one for each of the 𝑖 
commodities produced in sector 𝑗, and 𝑛 + 1 unknowns, namely, the 𝑛 prices 𝑝(cid:3036) and the 
profit rate 𝑟. However, once that has been recognized, a huge obstacle surfaces immediately 
since there is no established method for solving this kind of system. How did Torrens got 
around this difficulty? Before delving into that, it is instructive to go through a quantitative 
example included in the second edition of his External Corn Trade to have a sample of how 
the system worked in its creator’s hands. 

With Torrens, we shall consider a two-sector model in which agriculture, sector 𝑆(cid:2869), 
uses 50 suits and 100 quarters of corn as advances to wages, obtaining a harvest of 250 
quarters of corn from that expenditure. In turn, manufactures – sector 𝑆(cid:2870) – advance 50 suits 
and  100  quarters  of  corn  as  wages  to  its  laborers  to  produce  150  suits.  A  tabular 
representation of the situation can be registered as follows.

The composition of the final output is enough to ensure that the economy can reproduce 
itself  in  an  enlarged  scale.  A  purely  physical  calculation  of  the  profit  rate,  however,  is 
impossible,  since  the surplus  of corn  over  its  total  consumption  is  (50 ÷ 200) × 100 =
25%,  whereas  the  same  ratio  for  suits  equals  (50 ÷ 100) × 100 = 50%.  Therefore,  a 
different procedure must be devised. What is needed at this point is a pair of prices that 
permit the cost of inputs to be set against the total revenue for each kind of output in such a 
way  that  the  profit  rate  results  are  identical  for  both  sectors  by  the  utter  pressure  of 
competition. The years Torrens spent solving generic mathematical problems in the Navy 
are  now  quite  useful  since  he  ingeniously  defines  identical  physical  costs  for  both  corn 
raising and clothing manufacturing, so that their total capital expenditure is necessarily the 
same for any possible combination of prices. This fundamental problem-solving artifice also 
elicits an economic principle that Torrens rapidly introduces against Ricardo’s labor theory 
of value, stating that capitals of equal amount invested during the same time, under a regime 
of  overall  competition,  must  yield  the  same  profit  rate.8  As  Torrens  remarks  about  the 
workings of capitalistic markets in the third edition of the External Corn Trade: 

In this state of society the competition of capitalists will have a constant tendency to equalise 
the rate of profit; and it is a necessary consequence of the equality of profits, that the products 
of equal capitals, employed for equal times, should be of equal value. But the products of 
equal capitals are scarcely ever the products of equal quantities of labour; and consequently, 
as  the  quantity  of  producing  labour  is  no  longer  the  circumstance  on  which  competition 
turns, it ceases to be a regulating cause of value (Torrens 1826: 58). 

Torrens  thus  understands  competition  as  the  full  mobility  of  capital  and  labor  over  the 
economy  to  explore  eventual  differences  in  profit  rates.  Returning  to  our  example  and 
following the principle of a common profit rate for capitals of equal magnitude, all economic 
sectors must have identical sales revenues, so an additional equation for system (1) comes 
into  play  in  the  form  𝑝(cid:2869)𝑦(cid:2869)(cid:2869) = 𝑝(cid:2870)𝑦(cid:2870)(cid:2870) = ⋯ = 𝑝(cid:3041)𝑦(cid:3041)(cid:3041)  whenever  the  technical  combination 
among the different ingredients of capital is alike for the existing branches of production. 
By assuming any price as numéraire, one can easily calculate the remaining ones and, by 
extension, the profit rate. This is precisely what Torrens did to solve the above illustration. 
Then, if the price of corn is taken as 𝑝(cid:2869) =1.00, the price of each suit will be equivalent, in 
terms of quarters of corn, to 𝑝(cid:2870) =1.66, providing a common profit rate of 𝑟 × 100 =36.4% 
when both costs and total revenues are measured in quarters of corn (Torrens 1820: 399–
401; refer to the observation in Table 1). 
In addition to his tenacity to parade one numerical illustration after another in the second 
edition of his External Corn Trade, Torrens applies with advantage his system to several 
theoretical questions such as the invariable measure of value, the effect of the productivity 
of agriculture on the profit rate, and the convenience of free trade. As these issues have 
already  been dealt  with  in previous occasions  (Arthmar 2014; Hisamatsu 2009; see also 
Noguchi 1986), our intent in the remaining sections is to analyze how Torrens applied his 
                                                           
8  De  Vivo  (1985,  2001)  and  Samuel  Hollander  (1998)  have  engaged  in  a  debate  over  the  true  nature  of 
Torrens’s theory of profits, the former maintaining that it consisted in a pure corn-ratio model, and the latter 
defending that it assumed the heterogeneity of capital in agriculture. Although Hollander’s view seems more 
in line with Torrens’s conception, none of them acknowledged that a system of equations underpinned the 
multiple numerical examples formulated in the second edition of the External Corn Trade. This limitation 
renders  their arguments about Torrens’s theory of profits somewhat  flimsy. De Vivo  fails to perceive that 
Torrens uses physical illustrations of the profit rate just for simplicity of exposition, keeping the proportion 
between corn  and manufactured goods constant to ease up calculations in  most cases, although that is  not 
always true. Regarding Hollander’s observation, the mixed composition of capital goods is an assumption by 
Torrens not only for agriculture, but for all other economic sectors as well.

system of aggregate production to explain not only the prevalence of Say’s Law but also the 
events that could push the economy towards a general glut. 
 

4.  Effectual demand and Say’s Law 

In 1821 Torrens published his Production of Wealth, in which he methodically employs his 
analytical  system  of  the  aggregate  economy,  advising  the  reader  right  away  about  the 
originality of his theoretical reflections on Say’s Law, which would not be found in either 
Jean-Baptiste Say’s or James Mill’s writings (Torrens 1821: vi–ix). Torrens’s first step is to 
define capital essentially in a physical way, or as that collection of things which, under a 
system  of  general  division  of  labor  and  reciprocal  exchanges,  are  used  as  inputs  in  the 
production  of  articles  of  utility.  But  in  a  self-reproducing  system,  he  explains,  the 
sustainability of the whole economy depends on the critical condition that each ingredient 
of capital 𝑥(cid:3036)(cid:3037) is produced in such quantity 𝑦(cid:3036)(cid:3037) capable to replace with a surplus the whole 
amount ∑
 absorbed by all economic sectors during the ongoing productive cycle. And 
such theoretical condition, albeit derived in abstract and independently of actual prices, has 
notwithstanding  an  immediate  concrete  appeal,  as  Torrens  is  always  ready  to  cross  the 
narrow bridge between mental abstractions and reality: 

(cid:3041)
(cid:3037)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)

𝑥(cid:3036)(cid:3037)

The great practical problem in economical science is, so to proportion production that supply 
and demand shall be in the relation of equality; or, to express the same thing in particular 
rather than in general terms, that the quantity of the ingredients of capital brought to market 
to exchange against other commodities, shall be equal at the least to the quantity of these 
ingredients  expended  on  the  other  commodities.  So  long  as  this  proportion  is  preserved, 
every article which the industrious classes have the will and power to produce, will find a 
ready and a profitable vend (Torrens 1821: 370). 

Torrens thus defines supply and demand in a very particular way, as the adequate provision 
of  the  ingredients  of  capital  necessary  to  keep  the  whole  economy  operating  without 
disturbances and in a harmonic state of self-reproduction, or even at an amplified scale at 
each new productive cycle. As long as corn, clothing, and all other items consumed by the 
laborers,  as  well  as  the  raw  materials  and  elements  of  fixed  capital,  are  all  supplied  in 
adequate amount and proportionate to each other – as required by the prevailing division of 
labor, the efficiency of production and the level of real wages –, there would be no objective 
reason why a wide-reaching shortage of demand might ever occur. If the self-sufficiency 
and  proportionality  conditions  are  achieved,  the  whole  economy  can  thus  expand  itself 
continuously and every commodity would automatically open a market for another one, as 
predicted  by  Say’s  Law.9  Were  it  not  for  the  limited  availability  of  fertile  lands  and 
population, observes Torrens, that tend to raise wages and squeeze the profit rate until it 
falls  below  that  barely  minimum  required  by  capitalists  for  the  continuance  of  capital 
accumulation, the process could go on unimpeded while effectual demand would never be 
missing. 

For every article brought to market there would be a profitable vend. Each class would find 
that a part of the things it produced would replace the whole of the things it expended in 

                                                           
9 In his Commerce Defended, James Mill (1808: 82) had contended that since a market economy is ultimately 
a system of barter, once the overall assortment of commodities has been brought to the market, one half is 
always exchanged for the other, so that no excess supply would be ever observed. The statement, however, is 
framed  in  very  general  terms  and  presupposes  an  automatic  conformity  among  the  various  types  of 
commodities, something completely absent in Torrens’s theory, as shown in section 5 below.

production. But this is exactly what is meant by effectual demand; and the more accurately 
we analyse the operations of industry and the transactions of the market, the more clearly 
we shall perceive, that while the due proportions are preserved between the quantity of the 
ingredients of capital and of other things, increased production is the one and only cause of 
extended demand (Torrens 1821: 377). 

By  appealing  to  his  system  of  aggregate  production,  Torrens  is  able  to  quickly  dismiss 
Malthus’s perpetual concern with the prospect of too much love of parsimony generating an 
overaccumulation of capital that would bring about a general glut of commodities (Malthus 
1820: Chapter VII; Winch 2013: 84–95; Paglin 1961: 115–55). At this stage, introducing 
the illustrative case conceived by Torrens is expedient to show how even within an economy 
in a state of simple reproduction – i.e., without any net investment, and where all profits are 
expended in luxury  goods – there could be a situation of mutual equilibrium  among the 
many productive sectors when the aggregate production of capital is proportionate to the 
technical and social conditions of the economy.  But, before that, since luxury  goods  for 
capitalists  do  not  enter  the  productive  process  as  elements  of  capital,  Torrens  correctly 
advises the reader that their supply does not play any role in the determination of effectual 
demand.10 

No increased production of silks, for example, can give rise to an increased effectual demand 
either for muslins or for corn. The reason is obvious. In fabricating muslin or in raising corn, 
a great variety of articles of capital, such as food and clothing, material and implements, 
must be expended, and these ingredients of capital no supply of silks or of other superfluities 
can  replace.  Whatever  may  be  the  quantities  of  the  ingredients  of  capital  expended  in 
production, they can be replaced only by the same quantities of themselves (Torrens 1821: 
350). 

Consider a hundred cultivators of corn in sector 𝑆(cid:2869), a hundred manufacturers of clothing in 
𝑆(cid:2870),  another  hundred  cultivators  of  sugar  and  tobacco  in  𝑆(cid:2871),  and  another  hundred 
manufacturers of ribbons and lace in 𝑆(cid:2872). Each group of producers 𝑆(cid:3037) uses as ingredients of 
capital 100 quarters of corn and 100 suits as advances to their laborers. The final output is, 
respectively: 𝑦(cid:2869)(cid:2869) =400 quarters of corn; 𝑦(cid:2870)(cid:2870) =400 suits, 𝑦(cid:2871)(cid:2871) =an indefinite amount of sugar 
and  tobacco  (thenceforward  sugar  only);  and  lastly,  𝑦(cid:2872)(cid:2872) =another  indefinite  amount  of 
ribbons and lace (thenceforward lace only). With such numerical configuration, Torrens can 
develop his reasoning without having to find out equilibrium prices, and such quantitative 
system can be presented as follows:

The pattern of exchanges or the operation of effectual demand, in Torrens’s description, 
would play out, firstly, by capitalists in 𝑆(cid:2869) giving up 100 quarters of corn for 100 suits from 
𝑆(cid:2870); another 100 quarters of corn for a fourth part of sugar, i.e., 𝑦(cid:2870)(cid:2870) 4⁄  units from 𝑆(cid:2871); and 100 
quarters of corn for a fourth part of lace, or 𝑦(cid:2872)(cid:2872) 4⁄  units from 𝑆(cid:2872). The final collection of 
goods accruing to the capitalists in 𝑆(cid:2869) will be: 100 quarters of corn; 100 suits; 𝑦(cid:2870)(cid:2870) 4⁄  units 
of  sugar,  and  𝑦(cid:2872)(cid:2872) 4⁄   units  of  lace.  It  is  easily  verifiable  that  this  composition  will  be 
reproduced  for  the  capitalists  of  the  remaining  sectors.  The  upshot  is  that  all  profits, 
whatever their actual rate to capital disbursements and without even having to calculate their 
respective prices, will be fully spent in 𝑦(cid:2870)(cid:2870) and 𝑦(cid:2872)(cid:2872), while each group of capitalists will have 
back in their hands the required amount of corn and suits to start the productive cycle all 
over again at the previous scale. For Torrens, if the profit rate stays above the bare minimum 
required to keep the productive process going on, and the supply of material capital is duly 
proportionate among its several items, as depicted in the illustration above, no problem of 
effectual demand would ever occur. Such observation is precisely what Torrens considered 
as  his  personal  contribution  to  enrich  the  meaning  of  Say’s  Law  in  classical  economics 
(Torrens 1821: 341, 349, 352, 362, 371).11 

Having expressed the necessary condition for aggregate equilibrium, Torrens then 
begins  to  perform  the  mental  experiments  mentioned  in  section  two  by  contemplating 
alternative scenarios for the economy. Firstly, he does admit of the possibility of a quick 
process of capital accumulation creating an oversupply of commodities and a deficiency in 
effectual demand – as insisted upon by Malthus –, but only if the growing need of labor 
occasions an increase in wages that overtakes the supply of ingredients of capital available 
to continue the productive process at an enlarged scale. Nevertheless, the mismatch between 
the demand and supply of labor would be self-correcting, since the consequent lowering of 
the  profit  rate  would  ease  the  passion  for  accumulating  capital,  and  a  bigger fraction  of 
profits would then be spent back in those luxuries capitalists used to indulge themselves on 
before the desire for parsimony got stronger (Torrens 1821: 389–93).  

In addition, if the love of ease prevails instead of accumulating capital, which was 
another  possible  cause  for  a  lack  of  demand  raised  by  Malthus  (1820:  358–59),  then 
manufacturing  and  cultivation  would  contract  to  a  minimum,  just  enough  to  allow 
capitalists, landlords and workers to survive. A situation this extreme, however, could very 
well be attained with a due proportion being observed among the elements of capital so that 
no engorgement or glut would necessarily come about. Or, in Torrens’s (1821: 397) own 
words:  “Vary  our  suppositions  as  we  will,  increased  production,  provided  it  be  duly 
proportioned, is the one and only cause of extended demand, and diminished production the 
one and only cause of contracted demand”. More revealing, though, is his belief that when 
                                                           
11  For  the  sake  of  historical  accuracy,  the  first  instance  on  which  Torrens  adds  this  proviso  occurs  in  the 
mentioned 1819 Edinburgh Review article, when he talks about the effects of the introduction of machinery in 
production  which, according to him, had been wrongly criticized by Robert Owen: “The alterations which 
occasionally take place in the distribution of industry, may lead to temporary embarrassment; but after the 
readjustment has been effected, and commodities are brought to market in quantities duly proportioned to 
each  other,  the  increased  supply  will  be  accompanied  by  increased  demand”  (Torrens  1819:  472;  italics 
added). 

 

 

11 

the  markets  are  left  alone  to  adjust  by  themselves,  they  would  reach  the  best  possible 
distribution of capital and labor by the pressure of competition on people and capital, thus, 
restoring the equilibrium of the whole economy. 

Thus,  in  every  conceivable  case,  a  redundant  supply  of  a  commodity  occasioned  by  an 
improvement  in  the  productive  powers  of  industry,  after  occasioning  temporary 
embarrassment  and  distress,  would  be  succeeded  by  a  rectifying  process,  and  would 
terminate in conferring solid advantages upon the society at large (Torrens 1821: 417). 

We shall now inspect how Torrens articulated his explanation for the general glut, which 
many voices at the time proclaimed to be the effective state of the British economy during 
the years following Waterloo. 
 

5.  The general glut and its progression 

In the Production of Wealth, Torrens does not challenge the contention that economic crises 
do exist. In fact, he remarks that even the most complex theory, if not in conformity with 
the facts of social life, should be discarded without further ado. And his own disquisitions 
on the working of the markets, he announces with his usual self-assurance, should be no 
exception to such methodological rule. 
If the theory of effectual demand, which I have ventured to unfold, does not explain in a satisfactory manner 
that overstocking of the market, and want of profitable vend for commodities, the existence of which is matter 
of general experience, I am ready to admit that such theory must be essentially defective and incorrect (Torrens 
1821: 399). 
Being true to his previous exposition, Torrens (1821: 400) then introduces two reasons for 
the occurrence of a general glut within a competitive economy: first, the miscalculations of 
some producers, who bring to the market an amount of certain ingredients of capital different 
from  that one the consumers and remaining producers are willing to trade for their own 
commodities; and second,  the fluctuation in harvests, which time and again throw upon the 
market  a  quantity  of  corn  and  other  agricultural  commodities  either  above  or  below  its 
adequate proportion with the existing supply of the other elements of capital. But the task 
of explaining how a general glut or engorgement develops is now somewhat more difficult, 
since  Torrens  is  forced  to  tread  into  the  treacherous  terrain  of  economic  disequilibrium, 
through which effectual demand, prices, quantities and the profit rate are in disarray and 
undergoing drastic changes over time. But his characteristic tenacity does not fail the former 
Royal Navy Colonel, and Torrens begins a long digression on how a bountiful harvest could 
bring down the whole economy in its path.  

Since for Torrens, as seen, an explanation would only be complete when anchored 
on a numerical illustration, an accompanying and sophisticated example is elaborated, in a 
situation which unfolds itself over successive production periods: 𝑡, 𝑡 + 1 and 𝑡 + 2. And 
to make matters even more involved, he introduces money as the mean of exchange into a 
hypothetical economy like the one presented in the previous section. But  along with the 
conditions  already  specified,  each  sector  is  supposed  to  own  now  a  sum  of  £100  at  the 
beginning  of  the  productive  cycle  and,  under  equilibrium,  end  the  cycle  with  the  same 
amount  in  its  account  after  all  exchanges  have  been  processed.  Since  the  case  under 
consideration is one of simple reproduction, corn and clothing have their unitary price at the 
initial period 𝑡 set as 𝑝(cid:2869),(cid:3047) = 𝑝(cid:2871),(cid:3047) =1.0, while each sector starts off with a capital of £300 
(corn, clothing and cash) and closes its operations with the same £300 plus £200 in luxury

goods.  The  common  profit  rate,  hence,  is  𝑟(cid:3047) × 100 = (cid:4672)

The state of general equilibrium, however, undergoes a commotion once the usual corn crop, 
due to exceptional favorable circumstances, goes up to 500 quarters for the same advances 
in period 𝑡 + 1, marking the first step in the march of the general glut. We must then inspect 
how  the  economic  disequilibrium  surfaces  in  Torrens’s  thought-experiment.  The  first 
consequence of such bountiful harvest would be, according to his supposition, a reduction 
in half of the money price of corn due to the one-fourth increase in supply, so that 𝑝(cid:2869),(cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:2869) = 
0.5-pound  per  quarter.  But  as  the  demand  for  corn  is  supposedly  inelastic,  Torrens 
continues,  consumers  will  buy  the  same  quantity  as  before,  although  at  a  very  lowered 
expense.12 From the clothiers, corn farmers purchase £100 in clothing, but receive back now 
just £50 for 100 quarters of corn. The reproduction of both sectors, despite the asymmetry 
in prices, is thus materially assured at this second productive stage. But from sugar growers, 
corn farmers receive only £50 from 100 quarters of corn and are thus constrained to reducing 
their consumption of these commodities to the same amount of money received. Identical 
situation takes place in the exchanges between corn farmers and lace manufacturers.  

The market transactions under disequilibrium during period 𝑡 + 1 by producers in 
𝑆(cid:2869), as conceived by Torrens, are registered in the matrix below, over the first row (revenue) 
and the first column (expenditure) of Table 3.2. As total expenditures of £250 surpasses the 
corn farmers’ total revenue of £200, a £50 reduction in their cash holdings takes place in 
detriment of the clothiers, as already indicated. Having thus began the productive cycle with 
£300 capital in value, corn farmers finish their operations owning £50 in intra-sectoral trade 
in corn, £100 in clothing, £100 in luxury goods, and £50 in cash, for £300 in total, but still 
having £50 in unsold corn. Consequently, their profit rate for the second productive period 
is 𝑟(cid:2869),(cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:2869) = 0 (Torrens 1821: 403–6). 
 

                                                           
12 It could be argued that corn growers lower their price in expectation of selling an additional quantity of their 
larger stocks, but that this does not materialize because the demand for food depends also on the supply of the 
other ingredients of capital which, by assumption, have not suffered any increase.

Source:  Torrens  (1821:  403–8).  Some  rounding  has  been  done  to  facilitate  presentation.  The  transactions 
between 𝑆(cid:2871) and 𝑆(cid:2872), as well as the profit rates, have been estimated from Torrens’s own figures.  
 
For the clothiers in 𝑆(cid:2870), however, the situation is, at first, the most convenient, for they can 
now buy their 100 quarters of corn for only £50 and sell their clothing to corn farmers for 
£100.  Thus,  the  clothiers’  account  accumulates  £150  in  cash-balance.  Their  transactions 
with  producers  in  𝑆(cid:2871)   and  𝑆(cid:2872)  are  not  affected  in  period  𝑡 + 1,  they  keep  selling  £100  in 
clothing to each group and buying back the same amount of luxury goods, as depicted in the 
corresponding row and column of Table 3.2 for 𝑆(cid:2870). The clothiers’ initial capital amounted 
to £300, as indicated, but now they reach the end of the productive cycle with assets worth 
£50 in corn, £100 in clothing, £150 in cash and £200 in luxury goods. Their profit rate thus 
remains unchanged at 𝑟(cid:2871),(cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:2869) = 66.6% during the period, with no piling up of unsold suits 
(Torrens 1821: 406).  

Finally, as the demand for luxury goods from corn farmers has contracted in half, 
the price of luxury goods, according to Torrens, experiences a one-sixth drop to 𝑝(cid:2871),(cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:2869) =
𝑝(cid:2872),(cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:2869) = 0.83-pound, in addition to a given amount of unsold goods of the same proportion 
for both sectors. Thus, the whole supply of sugar, which formerly returned £400 in sales, 
(cid:2869)
will now fetch £332= (cid:4672)1 −
(cid:4673) ×£400 minus £40 of unsold goods at the new price, for a 
(cid:2874)
total revenue of just £292. From this amount, £50 comes from  corn  farmers, £100 from 
clothing  manufacturers,  and  the  remaining  £142  from  the  intra-sectoral  trade  of  £71, 
accompanied  by  another  £71  from  the  trade  among  sugar  farmers  and  lace  producers. 
Identical sums, says Torrens, apply to the commercial transactions by lace producers in 𝑆(cid:2872). 
At the end of the productive cycle, sugar farmers will then possess £50 in corn, another £100 
in clothing, £100 in cash, £71 in sugar and £71 from the intra-sectoral trade in lace, with 
£40 of unsold goods, as shown in Table 3.2 for farmers in 𝑆(cid:2870). Their profit rate plummets to 
− 1(cid:4673) × 100 = 30.6%  during  the  period,  the  same  gain  obtained  by 
𝑟(cid:2870),(cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:2869) × 100 = (cid:4672)
lace producers. 

(cid:2871)(cid:2868)(cid:2868)

(cid:2871)(cid:2877)(cid:2870)

We  can  easily  notice  that  the  general  glut,  began  in  the  corn-growing  activity, 
quickly spread to the luxury goods sectors, followed by falling prices, the accumulation of 
unsold commodities and a drop and dispersion in profit rates. The clothing producing sector, 
as seen, has escaped the debacle unharmed, and despite its severity, the glut is not properly 
general at this point. Perhaps, most importantly, all sectors manage to replace their physical 
capital used up during the current production cycle. To this overall picture of the economy, 
Torrens then adds a second abundant corn harvest in 𝑡 + 2, raising its total supply to 600 

 

14 

quarters, including the unsold amount stored from the previous period. There is no need to 
go through the whole sequence of transactions among the distinct sectors for this third stage 
of the crisis to reach what Torrens sought to show. Since corn prices drop once again, its 
producers have their receipts further squeezed. The luxury  goods sectors  also undergo  a 
similar receding in prices and profits, forcing all these producers to restrict their scale of 
production for lack of profitable outlets. Sooner or later, the narrowed effectual demand will 
hit the clothing producing sector equally as hard.13 According to Torrens, this is when the 
glut grows deeper and becomes a general phenomenon. 

But as soon as the farmers, with the growers of sugar and the manufacturers of lace, ceased 
to be able to sell their commodities at prices  which  would repurchase the ingredients of 
capital expended in their production, they would from interest no less than necessity, employ 
less  capital  than  before,  and  consequently  a  less  quantity  of  clothing,  the  second  great 
ingredient  of  capital,  would  be  demanded  and  consumed.  The  class  of  clothiers,  after  a 
temporary prosperity, would now participate in the general stagnation. For a considerable 
part of their products no profitable or desirable sale could be effected (Torrens 1821: 412). 
While money is part of the scenario concocted by Torrens, the crisis is truly ignited by a 
real factor, i.e., the disproportion among the supply of the ingredients of capital or, in terms 
of  system  (1),  among  the  various  commodities  𝑦(cid:3037)(cid:3037)  composing  the  aggregate  supply. 
Regardless of the specific values and proportions attributed by him to changes in prices and 
effectual demand, Torrens believed his numerical illustration provided a useful picture of 
what  happens  in  the  real  world  since  price  reductions  during  a  glut  would  have  a  more 
damaging  effect  over  the  moderate  profit  rates  prevailing  in  the  actual  economy.  Even 
something resembling a kind of cobweb oscillation could be observed during the adjustment 
in agriculture. For after a succession of bountiful harvests, as capital there leaves toward 
more  profitable  activities,  crops  might  even  fall  below  the  requirements  of  the  whole 
economy, creating now a reverse disproportion in effectual demand (Torrens 1821: 417–
18).  

Although  the  foundation  of  the  general  glut  is  located  in  the  real  economy  in 
Torrens’s theory, it does not preclude the crisis being intensified by the presence of money. 
Indeed,  as  he  argues,  monied  capitalists  would  benefit  the  most  during  a  deflationary 
episode,  first,  by  the  increased  purchasing  power  of  their  cash-holdings;  second,  by  the 
higher real interest rate obtained from loans, and lastly, by the intrinsic quality of money as 
the universal equivalent in times of distress. This last factor makes having cash in hand the 
main  goal  of  business  when  the  derangement  of  markets  is  running  loose.  A  kind  of 
preference for liquidity emerges, and the exchanges grow biased towards holding money 
instead of commodities, a factor that greatly intensifies the original drop in prices: 

Hence,  on  every  occasion  of  glut  or  general  stagnation,  the  desire  of  turning  goods  into 
money  is  rendered  more  intense  than  the  desire  of  turning  money  into  goods,  and  the 
proportion in  which prices  will fall,  will  be  much greater than  that in  which the relation 
between the quantity of commodities and the amount of currency will be altered (Torrens 
1821: 420). 

                                                           
13 Closer inspection of Table 3.2 reveals that the contraction in the production scale of sectors 𝑆(cid:2869), 𝑆(cid:2871) and 𝑆(cid:2872) is 
not even needed to get the clothiers in 𝑆(cid:2870) engulfed by the crisis. Since corn farmers in 𝑡 + 2 have now only 
£50 in cash  to  buy  £100 in clothing, if credit is  not introduced  into the  model, that  would  mean a severe 
retrenchment in the effectual demand for the supply from producers in 𝑆(cid:2870). Torrens believed that interest rates 
would get higher than profit rates in times of deflation; thus, precluding the counterbalancing action of this 
possible channel of adjustment. “The multiplied failures in agriculture, manufactures, and trade, would strike 
a panic into the holders of floating capital, and they would refuse to grant accommodation upon securities, 
which in more prosperous times they would be disposed to consider unobjectionable” (Torrens 1821: 425).

As a matter of practical policy, which is the final step of reasoning on economic issues for 
Torrens, four main initiatives were suggested to keep the markets well-adjusted and prevent 
the recurrence of general gluts. First, he condemns the fluctuations in corn prices and its 
deleterious  effect  on  wages.  Being  the  main  component  of  the  laborers’  food,  corn 
availability deserved special attention for its role as the key ingredient of capital. Instability 
in its supply would upset the whole effectual demand; thus, impairing prosperity. The end 
of  protection  and  the  adoption  of  free  trade  would  be  the  best  way  to  overcome  this 
hindrance and keep a stable price for corn. Second, a uniform value for money would go a 
long way towards preserving the stability of the markets, more so in the context of Britain 
at the time, when a deliberate policy of monetary contraction to revaluate the pound was 
being  pursued  by  the  government  with  the  purpose  of  resuming  gold  convertibility  (see 
Cannan  1919:  vii–xlvi). Torrens  is  fully  against  the  deflationary  policy  produced  by  the 
tightening of the money supply on the  grounds that all economic contracts have already 
adjusted to the devalued purchasing power of money brought about by the Napoleonic Wars. 
Third, to facilitate the unavoidable displacement of capital from one sector to another in 
times of gluts, the prevailing usury laws had to be revoked, since they have been retarding 
the necessary transferences of capital and labor within the economy. Lastly, and perhaps the 
most important principle of all for Torrens, is the prudential rule of always introducing legal 
changes gradually, instead of replacing one law after the other. The uncertainty coming from 
an ever-shifting course of action would have as its only effect the confusion of producers, 
inducing them to err in their forecasts of the future effectual demand (Torrens 1821: 427–
30). 
 

6.  Concluding remarks 

Despite  some  claims  to  the  contrary  (Fetter  1962;  Robbins  1958:  v),  Torrens  may  be 
considered one of the best thinkers of the classical school (Gerkhe 2016: 150–56; O’Brien 
2004: 5). His works in economic theory displayed a clear appeal to pure abstraction that, 
albeit  not  expressed  in  full  mathematical  notation,  had  constant  resource  to  quantitative 
illustrations  to  support  his  arguments  on  economic  policy.  In  so  doing,  he  was  able  to 
connect  pure  theory  with  pressing  economic  issues  of  his  time,  indicating  what  he 
understood as the best measures to address contemporary problems of the British economy. 
That was certainly the case with his treatment of Say’s Law and the possibility of a general 
glut,  which  he  blamed  on  protection  of  the  corn  trade  and  the  efforts  to  resume  gold 
convertibility through deflation. 

The  foregoing  considerations  make  it  clear  that  Torrens’s  implicit  system  of 
equations was the base for his concept of proportional effectual demand. Both in his 1819 
and 1821 works he praised Jean-B. Say and James Mill for their advancement of the idea 
that supply is the true source of demand but qualified his praise by noting that they did not 
specify the particular conditions under which that proposition would be true. More to the 
point, the overall equilibrium of the aggregate economy required not only the full mobility 
of  labor  and  capital,  but  also  the  proportionate  supply  of  the  ingredients  of  capital.  By 
assuming a preestablished structure of production, Torrens indicated that, whenever such 
arrangement  was  violated,  either  by  miscalculations  of  producers  or  bumper  crops,  the 
economy could go through a cumulative process of engorgement of the markets, although 
for reasons quite apart from those devised by Malthus or Owen.
