Abstract 

This paper investigates the intra-household consumption allocation in order to analyze the economic 
inequality  among  individuals  of  Brazil.  We  estimate  a  collective  model  and  identify  the  resource 
shares for each family members.  Our empirical results reveal that men absorb a higher fraction of 
family  resources  than  women  in  all  family  sizes  analyzed.  We  also  find  that  the  share  of  total 
resources devoted to children increases with the number of children, but the average per child share 
decreases. In general, our results did not reject the collective model in all estimations. By contrast, 
we do reject the standard unitary model. Finally, our results are informatively crucial for the design 
of redistributive policy or social programs, because they provide a broader and more accurate view 
of  the  well-being  of  individuals.  More  precisely,  they  could  inform  policy  makers  about  how  to 
target individuals effectively within households in order to minimize the incidence of inequality as 
well as provide useful information for Conditional Cash Transfer programs (such as Bolsa-familia) 
on how to address the transfers more efficiently. 

Key words: collective model; resource share; inequality. 

 

Resumo 

Este artigo investiga a  alocação do  consumo intrafamiliar para analisar a desigualdade econômica 
entre indivíduos do Brasil. Estima-se um modelo coletivo e identificaram-se as chamadas parcelas 
de  recursos  de  cada  membro  da  família.  Os  resultados  empíricos  revelaram  que  os  homens 
absorvem uma maior fração dos recursos familiares do que as mulheres em todos os tamanhos das 
famílias analisadas. Verificou-se também que a proporção dos recursos totais dedicados às crianças 
aumenta  com  o  número  de  crianças,  mas  a  proporção  média  por  criança  decresce.  Em  geral,  os 
resultados obtidos não rejeitaram o modelo coletivo de comportamento dos domicílios em todas as 
estimativas.  Em  contrapartida,  nós  rejeitamos  o  modelo  unitário  padrão.  Finalmente,  esses 
resultados são informativamente  cruciais para o  desenho de políticas redistributivas ou programas 
sociais  porque  proporcionam  uma  visão  mais  ampla  e  mais  precisa  do  bem-estar  dos  indivíduos. 
Mais  precisamente,  nossos  resultados  podem  informar  os  formuladores  de  políticas  sobre  como 
beneficiar  aos  indivíduos  efetivamente  dentro  dos  domicílios,  a  fim  de  minimizar  a  incidência  da 
desigualdade,  bem  como  fornecer  informações  úteis  para  os  programas  de  Transferência 
Condicionada de Renda (como Bolsa-Família) sobre como desenhar as transferências de forma mais 
eficiente.

1.  Introduction 

One of the main concerns for a long time in economics has been the proper measure of inequality in 
order to understand, to some degree, the welfare of individuals. Brazil is well known for being one 
of  the  most  unequal  countries  in  the  world,  and  although  social  disparities  have  been  reduced  in 
recent  years,  inequality  is  still  high  and  lingering.  In  particular,  the  Gini  coefficient  decreased  by 
11% and settled at 0.515 between 2003 and 2014, and in this same period 29 million people got out 
of  poverty  (WORLD  BANK,  2016)3.  This  decline  in  inequality  has  been  induced  mainly  by 
redistributive public policies translated in conditional cash transfers program such as Bolsa Família 
(LUSTIG  et  al.,  2013),  the  increased  supply  of  public  services,  access  to  education,  formal 
employment and economic growth (DE SOUZA, 2012; ARNOLD; JALLES, 2014). 

A  vast  literature  has  studied  inequality  phenomenon  for  the  Brazilian  context  over  time  (see  e.g. 
LEFF,  1972;  LOVELL,  2000;  AZZONI;  SERVO,  2002;  DE  MENEZES  et  al.,  2012;  ARNOLD; 
JALLES,  2014;  among  others).  Nevertheless,  literature  on  inequality  often  ignores  the  intra-
household distribution of resources providing misleading analytical bases  to explore the degree of 
inequality at the individual level. This has been presented because the empirical evidence has used 
measures of well-being based on the consumption inequality at household level, which is the basis 
of  the  traditional  unitary  model  of  consumer  behavior4.  This  has  occurred  because  typical  micro-
data  on  consumption  usually  provide  information  at  the  household  level  instead  of  at  individual 
level.  These  informational  restrictions  lead  to  the  impossibility  of  obtaining  direct  measures  of 
inequality  based  on  individual  consumption.  In  order  to  address  this  drawback,  the  collective 
models  of  household  consumption  behavior  have  gained  increasingly  popularity  in  the  economic 
literature during recent years5. An intrinsic feature of the collective model is the so-called resource 
shares6, which are useful measures of individual consumption expenditure and it can be interpreted 
as  the  individual  bargaining  power  within  the  household.  Dunbar  et  al.  (2013)  point  out  that  if 
resource shares are unequal then there will be intra-household inequality. Hence, the knowledge of 
the share of resources for each individual within households may provide useful information about 
the well-being of people.  

Brazil  is  not  an  exception  to  this  issue  and  the  analysis  of  how  the  intra-household  resource 
allocation process is given has not received much attention and remains a puzzle. To fill this gap, in 
the present paper, we build a framework grounded in the collective household model developed in 
Dunbar  et  al.  (2013)  for  identifying  individuals’  resource  shares,  especially  for  children,  using 
Brazilian data. This is of particular interest in the sense that the individual allocations of resources 
within  households  are  not  usually  observed  and  retrieving  the  sharing  process  is  based  on  strong 
assumptions,  especially  when  children  are  considered  in  the  structural  model7.  More  generally, 
literature  on  collective  models  of  household  behavior  considers  children  as  either  consumption 
goods of parents, attributes of the household or they are not taken into account at all8. Nevertheless, 

                                                 
3 The income level of the poorest 40% of the population rose, on average, 7.1% in real terms between 2003 and 2014. 
Meanwhile, income growth for the population as a whole was of 4.4 (WORLD BANK, 2016). 
4This approach assumes that the household is a single decision-making  unit. That is, all household  members have the 
same utility function which is maximized subject to a household budget constraint (VERMEULEN, 2002; CHERCHYE 
et al., 2007). 
5 In contrast with the unitary model, this approach considers the household as a set of individuals, which have their own 
preferences, and an intra-household bargaining process to make decisions. (CHIAPPORI, 1988, 1992; CHERCHYE et 
al., 2012; BROWNING et al., 2013; DUNBAR et al., 2013; BARGAIN et al., 2014).  
6    Resource  shares  are  defined  as  each  member’s  share  of  total  household  consumption  expenditures.  Collective 
household models posit that each household member has access to a fraction of the household budget (a resource share), 
which defines the shadow budget faced by a household member and that jointly with the within-household shadow price 
vector determines the material well-being of the household member (MENON et al., 2012). 
7  See,  e.g.,  Browning  (1992);  Liu  and  Hsu  (2004);  Dunbar  et  al.  (2013)  and  Bargain  et  al.  (2014)  for  examples  of 
literature on the cost of children. 
8 See, e.g., Browning et al. (2013), Lewbel and Pendakur (2008) and Bargain and Donni (2012) for a literature that does 
not take account of children. 

 

there is consistent evidence that children have separate utility function in households (CHERCHYE 
et al., 2009). Therefore, an understanding of these relations is critical for informing policy makers 
about how to target individuals effectively within households in order to minimize the incidence of 
childhood  inequality.  This  will  be  possible  if  public  policies  are  addressed  to  some  type  of 
individuals or group of individuals within households such that they can have an impact.  

Our  work  is  related  to  a  growing  empirical  literature  of  collective  models  of  household  behavior, 
which  can  be  dated  back  to  Becker  (1965,1981).  Among  the  more  representative  studies  that 
identify  resource  shares  using  information  only  on  expenditures  at  the  household  level,  we  can 
mention  those  of  Chiappori  (1988,  1992);  Lewbel  and  Pendakur  (2008);  Lise  and  Seitz  (2011); 
Bargain and Donni (2012); Cherchye et al. (2012); Browning et al. (2013) and Dunbar et al. (2013). 
In particular, Lise and Seitz (2011) use UK data from 1968 to 2001 to analyze how changes in the 
source of household income can be translated into changes in individual consumption allowances. 
They  show  that  ignoring  consumption  inequality  within  households  yield  misleading  estimates  of 
the distribution of resources in  a particular society  as  a whole. Analyzing the case of Philippines, 
Haddad  and  Kanbur  (1989)  show  that  ignoring  within  household  inequality  may  have  serious 
downward  bias  in  about  30%  in  the  level  of  inequality  among  individuals.  Chiappori  and  Meghir 
(2015),  meanwhile,  also  argue  that  research  about  poverty  and  inequality  that  ignores  resources 
allocation  within  households  is  both  incomplete  and  misleading.  So,  taking  into  account  that  the 
ultimate  object  of  concern  of  redistributive  policies  is  the  improvement  of  the  individuals’  living 
standards, the degree of intra-household inequality as well as its determinants should be evaluated.     

Our study makes some noteworthy contributions to  the literature, particularly for Brazil. First,  we 
build a framework  grounded in  the collective household  model developed in  Dunbar et  al. (2013) 
for identifying individuals’ resource shares, especially for children using Brazilian data. Second, the 
present study allow identifying gender discrimination in the allocation of resources among children 
for  families  of  different  sizes  and  composition  in  order  to  show  how  it  contributes  to  total 
inequality.  In  addition,  an  analysis  across  regions  also  is  presented.  In  this  point,  recent  studies 
including  Zimmermann  (2012),  Dunbar  et  al.  (2013),  Azimi  (2015)  and  Hori  et  al.  (2015)  have 
reported systematic evidence of children gender bias in intra-household allocations. Azimi (2015), 
for  example,  using  Iranian  data  found  evidence  of  gender  bias  against  girls  in  intra-household 
resource allocation in rural areas. More specifically, he found that rural parents assign between 1.6 
and 1.9 percentage points more resources toward their sons relatively to their daughters. 

Although there are some studies as Braido et al. (2012) and Iglesias (2016) providing no evidence 
of  gender  bias  in  intra-household  resource  allocation  for  Brazil,  there  has  been  little  systematic 
research evaluating intra-household inequality across regions. Braido et al. (2012), using a data set 
collected  in  2002  of  a  conditional  cash  transfer  program  (Bolsa-escola),  found  no  evidence  that 
household consumption decisions change with the fact that a woman is receiving the transfer which 
suggests there is not this type of discrimination. On the other hand, Iglesias (2016) uses micro-data 
of  the  Consumer  Expenditure  Survey  (POF  2008-2009)  and  examine  how  much  of  the  family 
resources  are  dedicated  to  each  member  in  order  to  assess  individual  poverty.  He  found  no 
conclusive  evidence  in  relation  to  systematic  consumption  biases  against  boys  or  girls.  Once  this 
question remains open, we attempt to contribute to the debate delving deeper about the existence of 
gender-bias. 

We present an analysis across regions in order to capture possible heterogeneity. Previous studies, 
that  assess  inequality  in  Brazil,  found  that  regional  difference  in  income  distribution  is  the  main 
cause of inequality. For example, De Menezes et al. (2012) found regional inequality is diminishing 
for the older cohorts and is increasing, or nondiminishing, for the younger cohorts. Given that, one 
might  think  that  children  and/or  young  people  are  the  most  vulnerable  family  members  to  intra-
household  inequality.  Therefore,  this  type  of  analysis  is  essential  because  it  allows  laying  the 
foundations  so  that  public  policies  can  deal  more  effectively  with  poverty  gaps,  given  the 

characteristics  of  the  aforementioned  areas  and  the  fact  that  an  unequal  distribution  of  resources 
among  children  is  crucial  because  they  tend  to  carry  over  into  adulthood.  This  unequal  intra-
household  allocation  of  resources  can  lead  to  a  persistent  and  systematic  intergenerational 
transmission of inequality that affects well-being over an individual’s life-course and that are linked 
to poverty traps. 

Our  empirical  results  reveal  the  existence  of  inequality  in  the  allocation  of  resources  inside  the 
household.  In particular, we find that in  Brazilian families men absorb a higher fraction of family 
resources than women in all family sizes. We also find that the share of total resources devoted to 
children  increases  with  the  number  of  children,  but  the  average  per  child  share  decreases.  In 
addition, our results suggest that adults’ education level seems to be associated to a larger of his or 
her fraction of the total expenditure, but  is  negatively related with  resources of her or his  partner. 
Our finding reveal a positive effect of women’s participation in the labor market and her education 
level with the shares devoted to their children. Our results also identify a possible heterogeneity in 
the allocation of resources inside the household across regions.  In particular, we  find that families 
located in Southeast and Northeast regions seems to distribute their resources more equally among 
their  members  compared  to  the  other  regions.  In  general  terms,  our  results  did  not  reject  the 
collective  model  in  all  estimations.  By  contrast,  we  do  reject  the  standard  unitary  model.  Finally, 
our  results  are  informatively  crucial  for  the  design  of  redistributive  policy  or  social  programs, 
because  they  provide  a  broader  and  more  accurate  view  of  the  well-being  of  individuals.  More 
precisely,  they  could  inform  policy  makers  about  how  to  target  individuals  effectively  within 
households in  order to  minimize the incidence of  inequality as well as  provide useful information 
for  Conditional  Cash  Transfer  programs  (such  as  Bolsa-familia)  on  how  to  address  the  transfers 
more efficiently. 

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  In  the  next  section,  we  present  the  theoretical 
framework.  Section  3  describes  our  estimation  strategy,  data  set  and  sample  selection.  Section  4 
presents and discuss the main results. Finally, section 5 concludes. 

2.  Theoretical Framework 

In this study, we will build a framework grounded in the collective household model developed in 
Dunbar  et  al.  (2013)  to  estimate  the  allocation  of  resources  within  households.  The  approach  of 
Dunbar  et  al.  (2013)  identifies  the  resources  shares  using  information  about  how  to  vary  the 
household  expenditure  on  private  assignable  goods  with  the  size  of  household  and  total 
expenditure9. 

2.1. Collective Models and Resource Shares for Brazilian Families. 

We use superscripts for goods and subscripts for type of both people and households. In particular, 
we  assume  that  there  are  four  types  of  households  indexed  by  the  number  of  children  (𝑠)  in  the 
family, where 𝑠  =   {0,1, 2, 3}. Individual types are indexed by 𝑡, with 𝑡 = 𝑓 indicating father, 𝑡 = 𝑚 
mother  and  𝑡 = 𝑐    children.  Goods  are  in  turn  indexed  by  k  =  1,…,  K.  We  now  consider  that 
household  consume  𝐾  types  of  good  and  face  𝐾-vectors  of  market  prices  denoted  by  𝑝  =
𝐾]′  denote  𝐾-vectors  of  quantities  of  each  good  𝑘  purchased  by  a 
 [𝑝1, … , 𝑝𝐾]′.  Let  𝑧𝑠 =   [𝑧𝑠
household  of  size  𝑠  and  let  𝑥𝑡 =   [𝑥𝑡
𝐾]′  be  the  consumption  by  individual  of  type  𝑡.  Total 
expenditure, which may be subscripted either for households or individuals, is represented by 𝑦. For 
theoretical  convenience,  we  rule  out  socioeconomic  characteristics  as  well  as  distribution  factors 

1, … , 𝑥𝑡

1, … , 𝑧𝑠

                                                 
9 Private or exclusive goods are those that are not shared or that cannot be consumed together by more than one person 
and assignability means that we can observe which household member consumes the good  (DUNBAR et al., 2014). An 
intrinsic  feature  of  private  goods  is  that  they  not  have  any  economies  of  scale  in  consumption  (BROWNING  et  al., 
2013; DUNBAR et al., 2013). The common candidate for a private assignable good is clothing, because amounts spent 
on  clothing  for  each  household  members  are  usually  separately  observed  in  Consumer  Expenditure  Surveys 
(BROWNING et al., 1994). 

that  might  change  individual’s  preferences.  We  introduce  below  these  omitted  variables  in  our 
methodology  description.  The  model  allow  that  household  have  economies  of  scale  in  the 
consumption. The reason for this is to transform the vector of purchased quantities 𝑧𝑠 (by a matrix 
𝐴𝑠)  into  a  weakly  larger  bundle  of  private  good  equivalents  𝑥.  Each  household  member  receive  a 
share of this bundle, which satisfies the equality  𝑥 =   𝑥𝑓 + 𝑥𝑚 + 𝑥𝑐. Specifically, there is assumed to 
exist a 𝐾 by 𝐾 matrix 𝐴𝑠 such that 𝑥𝑓 + 𝑥𝑚 + 𝑥𝑐 = 𝑥 = 𝐴𝑠

−1𝑧𝑠

Each  household  member  of  type  𝑡  to  have  his/her  own  utility  function, 𝑈𝑡(𝑥𝑡).  Thus,  𝑈𝑚(𝑥𝑚) 
represent, for instance, the utility function that women would obtain living in a household when she 
consume  the  bundle  of  good  𝑥𝑚.  Nevertheless,  we  must  understand  𝑈𝑡(𝑥𝑡)  as  a  sub-utility  over 
goods in a given period because individual’s total utility can be influenced for the welfare of other 
household  members,  as  well  as  for  leisure  and  saving.  Therefore,  in  this  analysis,  𝑈𝑡(𝑥𝑡)  can  be 
interpreted  only  as  a  representation  of  preferences  over  goods  of  individual  𝑡 as  a  member  of  a 
household.  On the other hand, we assume for simplicity that the preferences of all children in  the 
household are equal11. In addition, we consider that utility function of each household member does 
not  depend on the size of household.  This  assumption implies that  𝑈𝑐(𝑥𝑐), 𝑈𝑚(𝑥𝑚) or  𝑈𝑓(𝑥𝑓)  do not 
vary with the number of children in the household. 

Similar to Browning et al. (2013) and Dunbar et al. (2013), we also make use of the assumption that 
allocation  of  goods  in  the  household  is  Pareto  efficient  and  that  it  does  not  suffer  from  monetary 
illusion. This assumption allows the existence of a monotonically increasing function 𝑈̃𝑠 such as the 
household of type 𝑠 buys the bundle of goods 𝑧𝑠 as follow: 

𝑚𝑎𝑥

𝑥𝑓 ,𝑥𝑚 ,𝑥𝑐 ,𝑧𝑠

𝑈𝑠̃[𝑈𝑓(𝑥𝑓), 𝑈𝑚(𝑥𝑚), 𝑈𝑐(𝑥𝑐), 𝑝 𝑦⁄ ] such that 𝑧𝑠 =   𝐴𝑠[𝑥𝑓 + 𝑥𝑚 + 𝑥𝑐] and 𝑦 = 𝑧𝑠

´ 𝑝         (1) 

The  maximization  problem  results  in  the  bundles  𝑥𝑡  of  private  goods  equivalents  that  each 
household  member  of  type  𝑡  consumes  within  household.  Each  individual  faces  a  shadow  price 
´ 𝑝, which defines the fraction of total household resource  
vector within household represented by 𝐴𝑠
corresponding to each member12. 

Assume that a resource share for a person of type 𝑡 in a household with 𝑠 children is represented by 
𝜂𝑡𝑠.  These  resource  shares  are  measures  of  individual  budget  constraint  at  intra-household  level 
which also represent the relative amount of household consumption for each individual. Dunbar et 
al.  (2013)  show  that  resource  shares  can  be  identified  if  we  consider  the  existence  of  private 
assignable  goods.  In  the  study,  we  use  clothing  expenditure  for  each  person  as  private  assignable 
good. 

We  now  consider  that  there  is  a  private  assignable  good  for  each  member  of  type  𝑡  within  the 
household. Since these type of goods are consumed by a particular member of the household, they 
only  appear  in  the  utility  function 𝑈𝑡(𝑥𝑡)  specific  for  each  individual  of  type  𝑡. Denote  𝑊𝑡𝑠(𝑦, 𝑝)  as 
the  share  of  household  total  expenditure  spent  by  a  member  of  type  𝑡  on  a  private  good  in  a 

                                                 
10  According  to  Dunbar  et  al.  (2013,  pag.444):  “For  example,  suppose  that  a  married  couple  without  children  ride 
together in a car (sharing the consumption of gasoline) half the time the car is in use. Then the total consumption of 

gasoline  (as  measured  by  summing  the  private  equivalent  consumption  of  each  household  member)  is 

3

2

  times  the 

purchased quantity of gasoline. Equivalently, if there had been no sharing of auto usage, so every member always drove 
alone,  then  the  couple  would  have  had  to  purchase  50  percent  more  gasoline  to  have  each  member  travel  the  same 
distance as before. In this example, we would have 𝑥𝑘 = (
) 𝑧𝑘 for k being gasoline, so the kth row of A would consist 

3

 in the kth column and zeros elsewhere. This 

of 
household. A purely private good k would have 𝑥𝑘 = 1”. 
11The  model  could  be  extended  and  allow  that  children  have  different  utility  functions.  Notwithstanding,  this  would 
require adding private assignable goods for each child, which we leave for future research due to limited information. 
12 The shadow price vector is the same for all household members and it will be lower than market price for goods that 
are consumed jointly or shared because of economies of scales in consumption (LEWBEL;PENDAKUR, 2008). 

 can be interpreted as the degree of "publicness" of good k within the

household of type 𝑠. Let 𝑤𝑡(𝑦, 𝑝) be the hypothetical share of total expenditure 𝑦 that an individual 
of type 𝑡 would spend on his or her own assignable good when he or she is maximizing his or her 
own  utility  function  subject  to  individual  budget  constraint  𝑝′𝑥𝑡 = 𝑦.  Unlike  in  Browning  et  al. 
(2013), these individual demand functions need not be observable. Given all these assumptions, we 
represent  demand  functions  for  private  assignable  good  of  each  household  member,  which  are 
derived from equation (1) and have the following form13: 

𝑊𝑐𝑠(𝑦, 𝑝) =   𝑠𝜂𝑐𝑠(𝑦, 𝑝). 𝑤𝑐(𝜂𝑐𝑠(𝑦, 𝑝)𝑦, 𝐴𝑠
𝑊𝑓𝑠(𝑦, 𝑝) =   𝜂𝑓𝑠(𝑦, 𝑝). 𝑤𝑓𝑠(𝜂𝑓𝑠(𝑦, 𝑝)𝑦, 𝐴𝑠
𝑊𝑚𝑠(𝑦, 𝑝) =   𝜂𝑚𝑠(𝑦, 𝑝). 𝑤𝑚𝑠(𝜂𝑚𝑠(𝑦, 𝑝)𝑦, 𝐴𝑠

´ 𝑝) 
´ 𝑝) 
´ 𝑝) 

                                 (2) 

 
Equation (2) states that the household’s budget share for a person’s private assignable good is equal 
to her resource share multiplied by the budget share she would choose herself if facing her personal 
shadow  budget  constraint.  The  left-hand  side  of  expression  (2)  represent  the  household  demand 
function  𝑊𝑡𝑠,  which  is  observable  from  the  information  available  on  household  consumption  with 
different level of expenditures and when facing diverse 𝑝 regimes. In particular, we want to identify 
resource shares (𝜂𝑡𝑠) using only data from a single price regimen.     

The  process  of  identification  developed  by  Browning  et  al.  (2013)14  entails  two  problems  in  our 
model  concerning  to  children.  Firstly,  it  is  not  possible  for  us  to  obtain  information  about  the 
demand  functions  of  children  living  alone.  In  order  to  shed  light  on  this  problem,  Dunbar  et  al. 
(2013) assume that the parents and children have utility functions over goods that do not depend on 
the  household  size.  Secondly,  it  is  necessary  to  have  both  observed  price  variation  and  the 
measurement  of  price  responses  in  household  demand  function  in  order  to  identify  household 
consumption technology 𝐴𝑠. 

Following  the  same  arguments  of  Dunbar  et  al.  (2013),  the  solution  for  these  two  problems  is 
presented in the following two steps. First, we assume that the resource shares functions 𝜂𝑡𝑠 do not 
depend on 𝑦, at least at its low levels. However, resource shares can vary with associated variables 
such as income, wages, or wealth. Second, semi-parametric restrictions on the shapes of individual 
Engel  Curve  are  imposed.  More  specifically,  the  individual  resource  shares  are  identified  by 
comparing household demand for private assignable goods either across people within household or 
across  households  for  a  given  type  of  person.  In  the  next  subsections,  we  will  examine  in  more 
details these restrictions and our identification strategy.  

 

2.2. Identification of Resource Shares Using Engel Curves.  

We  achieve  the  identification  of  individual  resource  shares  using  data  only  on  Engel  curves  for 
private  assignable  goods  in  household  with  children.  In  particular,  we  follow  closely  the 
specification  adopted  by  Dunbar  et  al.  (2013)  about  Engel  curves  for  private  assignable  goods, 
which can be written as: 

𝑊𝑐𝑠(𝑦) =   𝑠𝜂𝑐𝑠𝑤𝑐𝑠(𝜂𝑐𝑠𝑦)

13 The complete derivation of (2) is available in the online appendix of Dunbar et al. (2013). 
14  Browning  et  al.  (2013)  achieve  identification  by  assuming  that  𝑤𝑡𝑠  on  the  right-hand  side  is  observable  via  the 
behavior  of  single  people,  leaving  just  one  subscripted  unobserved  function  to  worry  about:  the  resource  shares  𝜂𝑡𝑠 
(DUNBAR et al., 2013). 

In  equation  (3),  the  main  goal  is  identifying  the  resource  shares  without  price  variation15. 
Nevertheless,  it  is  not  possible  to  identify  directly  because  there  are  two  unknown  functions  of 
resource shares on the right side, 𝜂𝑡𝑠 and 𝑤𝑡𝑠(𝜂𝑡𝑠𝑦). To deal with this problem, a pair of restrictions 
over  preferences  are  imposed.  In  the  spirit  of  Dunbar  et  al.  (2013),  we  might  assume  that  the 
preferences  on  private  assignable  goods  are  similar  across  household  members  and  across 
household.  For  simplicity  in  the  estimation,  we  assume  that  individual  preferences  over  private 
assignable  goods  are  represented  by  a  PIGLOG  indirect  utility  function,  which  can  have  the 
following form: 

𝑊𝑐𝑠 (𝑦) = 𝑠𝜂𝑐𝑠(𝛿𝑐𝑠 + 𝛽𝑐𝑠  ln   𝜂𝑐𝑠) +   𝑠𝜂𝑐𝑠 𝛽𝑐𝑠 ln   y 
𝑊𝑚𝑠 (𝑦) = 𝜂𝑚𝑠(𝛿𝑚𝑠 + 𝛽𝑚𝑠  ln   𝜂𝑚𝑠) +   𝜂𝑚𝑠 𝛽𝑚𝑠 ln   y                               (4) 
𝑊𝑓𝑠 (𝑦) = 𝜂𝑓𝑠(𝛿𝑓𝑠 + 𝛽𝑓𝑠  ln   𝜂𝑓𝑠) +   𝜂𝑓𝑠 𝛽𝑓𝑠 ln   y 

 

The restriction that we mentioned above are that the preferences can be similar across people (SAP) 
or  can  be  similar  across  type  of  household  (SAT).  The  SAP  and  SAT  conditions  can  be  used 
together  to  strengthen  identification,  this  implies  that  𝛽 = 𝛽𝑐𝑠 =   𝛽𝑚𝑠 =   𝛽𝑓𝑠.  In  this  sense, 
household demand for private assignable good is given by: 

𝑊𝑐𝑠 (𝑦) = 𝑠𝜂𝑐𝑠(𝛿𝑐𝑠 + 𝛽  ln   𝜂𝑐𝑠) +   𝑠𝜂𝑐𝑠 𝛽  ln   y 
𝑊𝑚𝑠 (𝑦) = 𝜂𝑚𝑠(𝛿𝑚𝑠 + 𝛽  ln   𝜂𝑚𝑠) +   𝜂𝑚𝑠 𝛽 ln   y                                   (5) 
𝑊𝑓𝑠 (𝑦) = 𝜂𝑓𝑠(𝛿𝑓𝑠 + 𝛽  ln   𝜂𝑓𝑠) +   𝜂𝑓𝑠 𝛽 ln   y 

 
for any household size 𝑠 and for any type person 𝑐, 𝑚 ,𝑓. The slope of these three Engel curves can 
be  identified  across  the  linear  regression  of  the  private  good’s  household  budget  share  on  ln 𝑦. 
Since  the  Engel  curves  slope  is  proportional  to  the  resource  shares  and  these  sum  up  to  one,  the 
three resource shares and the preference parameter can be identified. This identification strategy is 
attractive because  we can identify the levels  of resource shares for children and adults, as well as 
how they vary  with  distribution factors.  This is  possible using  even one or both  restrictions, SAT 
and/or SAP. Furthermore, we emphasize that this identification strategy does not need information 
about variation of prices and does not require detailed information of total expenditure for different 
goods. We only need information about  the total  household  expenditure and  expenditure on  some 
private assignable good. 

 

3.  Empirical Approach and Data. 
3.1. Estimation Method. 

This  section  describes  how  resource  shares  for  each  household  members  are  estimated  using 
information  on  only  Engel  curves  system  at  household  level  without  price  variation.  Some  socio-
demographic  variables  omitted  in  the  theoretical  approach  that  can  change  the  preference  and/or 
resource share are included now in our model. In particular, we include the following variables in 
our  models:  residency  region  (dummy  for  each  region:  North,  South,  Northeast,  Central-West 
(Southeast being the default); residency area (dummy variable indicating: urban or rural area); age 
and  education  level  both  from  the  household  head  and  spouse;  dummy  variable  for  house 
ownership,  dummy  variable  for  ethnicity.  For  the  children’s  case:  number  of  children  in  the 
household; women’s work participation; the proportion of children girls and average children age. 
Finally, we consider that the individual preferences are from the PIGLOG indirect  utility function 
(AIDS). Particularly, the general budget shares equations can be written as: 

                                                 
15 Functions 𝑤𝑡𝑠 offer the demand function of individual 𝑡 when facing the price vector 𝐴𝑠
Thus, 𝑤𝑡𝑠(𝜂𝑡𝑠𝑦)=𝑤𝑡(𝜂𝑡𝑠(𝑦, 𝑝)𝑦, 𝐴𝑠

´ 𝑝) for a specific value of 𝑝. 

´ 𝑝 for an specific value of 𝑝. 

𝑊𝑐𝑠 (𝑦) = 𝑎 + 𝑧𝑐 +  𝑠𝜂𝑐𝑠(𝛿𝑐𝑠 + 𝛽𝑐𝑠  ln   𝜂𝑐𝑠) +   𝑠𝜂𝑐𝑠 𝛽𝑐𝑠 ln   y +   ɛ𝑐 
𝑊𝑚𝑠 (𝑦) = 𝑎 + 𝑧𝑚 + 𝜂𝑚𝑠(𝛿𝑚𝑠 + 𝛽𝑚𝑠  ln   𝜂𝑚𝑠) +   𝜂𝑚𝑠 𝛽𝑚𝑠 ln   y +   ɛ𝑚           (6) 

𝑊𝑓𝑠 (𝑦) = 𝑎 + 𝑧𝑓 + 𝜂𝑓𝑠(𝛿𝑓𝑠 + 𝛽𝑓𝑠  ln   𝜂𝑓𝑠) +   𝜂𝑓𝑠 𝛽𝑓𝑠 ln   y +   ɛ𝑓 

 
In order to estimate the resource shares it is necessary to impose either one or both restrictions (SAP 
and  SAT).  In  this  sense,  three  scenarios  can  be  observed.  First,  when  we  assume  the  SAP 
restrictions,  𝛽𝑡𝑠 = 𝛽𝑠  for  all  individual  type  𝑡.  Second,  if  we  impose  the  SAT  restrictions,  we  have 
𝛽𝑡𝑠 = 𝛽𝑡 for all household size 𝑠. Last, when the two conditions are imposed we have that 𝛽𝑡𝑠 =  𝛽 for 
all 𝑡 and 𝑠. 

The vector of 16 demographic variables is denoted by 𝑧 while that vector of 3 dummy variables that 
represent  each  household  type  is  denote  by  𝑎.  For  each  person  𝑡,  the  resource  shares  𝜂𝑡𝑠  and  the 
intercept  preference parameters  𝛿𝑡𝑠 are specified as linear in 𝑎 and 𝑧, so they have 20 coefficients 
each.  There  are  no  constant  terms  in  the  resource  share  functions  or  the  intercept  preference 
parameters—the levels are captured by the three household size dummies for households with zero 
to  three  children.  Since  the  error  terms  may  be  correlated  across  equations,  we  will  estimate  the 
system using non-linear Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) method.  
The  estimation  of  equation  (6)  results  in  the  share  of  total  household  expenditure  on  private 
assignable good for each member type, the resource shares 𝜂𝑡𝑠. So, we will know how resources are 
allocated in the household. Following the interpretation of Dunbar et al. (2013), if resource shares 
are  unequal,  then  there  will  be  intra-household  inequality.  Once  we  controlled  for  a  series  of 
demographic variables, included in the 𝑧 vector in equation (6), we can observe how distribution of 
resources within household varies with these variables. 

 

3.2. Data and Sample Selection. 

This  study  uses  micro-level  data  from  the  Consumer  Expenditure  Survey  (POF)  collected  by  the 
Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics  (IBGE).  This  survey  is  based  on  a  representative 
sample of Brazilian households. The POF provides information  on expenditures, incomes,  as well 
as socioeconomic and demographics characteristic at  the household  level and the individual level. 
Our analysis is based on data of the most recent survey (POF 2008-2009), which has information of 
55.970 representative households (IBGE, 2010). It was collected between 19 of May 19 of 2008 and 
May 18 of 2009. 

For the purposes of this study, we restricted the sample according to the following lines:  first, we 
exclude polygamous families or households larger than the traditional family. We called traditional 
family  as  those  household  formed  only  by  married  couple  with  or  without  children.  Families 
including  other  relatives  such  as  grandparents  or  uncles  or  aunts  are  removed.  This  last  selection 
rule is quite costly in terms of data, approximately 10 percent of the initial sample, but is necessary 
as  we  do  not  model  consumption  decisions  for  households  different  from  the  traditional 
composition. More precisely, we only take couples that have of zero to three children all under 14 
years of age. Families with children over 14 years also are excluded (13,02 percent) 16. Second, we 
exclude  the  households  with  two  or  more  families  sharing  a  common  residence  or  unit  of 
consumption,  which  excludes  another  9%  of  the  sample17.  Third,  we  drop  household  with  any 
missing or incomplete data on the age or education level of members. Fourth, we select households 

                                                 
16 The reason to exclude children over 14 years lies mainly in the fact that we have to separately identify expenditure on 
children’s  clothing  from  adult’s  clothing.  The  POF  2008-2009  considered  household  expenditure  on  clothing  for 
children for all purchase or rental for individuals up to 14 years (IBGE, 2010).      
17 We are not able to differentiate the consumption patterns of two or more families sharing the same residence because 
the  household  identification  in  the  POF  is  based  on  the  address  of  the  residence.  Given  this  limitation,  households 
where the unit of consumption is greater than one are excluded. 

where adults are aged between 18 and 65  years, then households with members over 65  years are 
excluded (4,77 percent of the full sample). Fifth, we further restrict our sample to households with 
zero expenditure on clothing, as well as obvious outlying observations18. Sixth, we do not allow for 
men to be inactive so that we do not have a corner solution issue for men19. Finally, we are left with 
a sample of 6759 households (12,07 percent of the initial sample), which is composed for 2390 with 
childless couples (36,36 percent of the final sample), 2128 couples with one child (31,48 percent),  
1695 couples with two children (25,07 percent), and the remaining  546 (8,07 percent) are couples 
with three children20,21. 

We  use  clothing  expenditure  for  each  person  as  our  single  private  assignable  good.  We  need 
information  about  these  goods for household  head, spouse, boys and  girls to  identify the resource 
shares in our model. Fortunately, for the requirements of our empirical analysis, the POF provides 
this information separately22. We remark that inclusion of a set demographic characteristic help to 
identify  the  resource  shares  more  precisely,  although  they  are  not  necessary  for  the  identification 
(DUNBAR  et  al.,  2013).  The  estimation  of  the  resource  shares  is  done  based  on  a  reference 
household.  We  define  reference  household  as  one  in  which  all  socio-demographic  variables  take 
value  of  zero.  In  particular,  we  include  16  socio-demographic  variable:  residency  region  (North, 
Northeast,  South  and  Central-West  with  Southeast  as  the  left-out  category);  residency  area 
(reference  category:  urban  location);  ethnicity  (reference  category:  non-white);  the  proportion  of 
children who are girl; dummy for indicators for women’s work participation and binary indicators 
for  house  ownership.  Given  that  zero  values  in  the  age  and  in  the  level  of  education  of  the  adult 
household members are impossible to find for the first case and rare in the second case, we use the 
deviation  of  mean  values  for  age  and  deviation  of  model  values  for  education  in  each  type  of 
household as indicator of this variables. This  allows us to obtain a greater proportion of reference 
families.    Finally,  we  permit  that  these  socio-demographic  variables  affect  the  preferences  and/or 
resource shares. Table 1 summaries descriptions of variables that we use in the estimations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
18 This restriction is very important for the estimation of our structural model because clothing  is central goods used in 
the identification and the estimation of our measure of inequality. 
19 Since leisure is not modeled here, this restriction allows us to avoid with a potential problem of endogeneity between 
leisure and consumption decisions. 
20  Dunbar  et  al.  (2013)  argue  that  having  information  about  households  with  more  than  three  children  can  be  used  to 
over-identify the model. However, we do not consider households with more than three children in this research. The 
main reason is based in the fact that for Brazil case is likely that in households of this type the first child is older than 14 
years.  Thus,  we  do  not  have  private  assignable  good  for  these  children,  and  consequently  we  can  not  identify  the 
resource shares.    
21 We recognize that our results can be skewed or misleading if our final sample does not represent the distribution of 
resources within the households of the entire population. However, we believe that it is unlikely that our results change 
significantly. 
the  
sample weights in all our estimations.  
22 For the construction of these variables, we used the questionnaire POF-4 (Questionário de Aquisição Individual) of 
POF  2008-2009.  More  specifically,  we  used  Tables  34-36  of  this  questionnaire  which  provide  information  of 
expenditure at individual level of clothing for men, women and children respectively.

4.  Empirical Results and Discussion. 
4.1. A first overview at the data. 

We begin this section by providing some basic descriptive statistics that allow us to characterize our 
sample.  Table 2 show this information, which is stratified by household type. We observe that men 
are relatively older than women. There is a gap of 3.8 years when we take the sample as a whole (on 
average, males are 37.9 years while females are 34.9 years). Interestingly, men and women tend to 
have a similar education level. In fact, considering all types of household the education level is the 
same, 8.2 years23. Small differences are observed when we analyze the different types of family. In 
particular,  on  average  the  level  of  education  ranging  from  7.6  (7.8)  and  7.8  (7.7)  years  for  men 
(women) between childless couples and couples with three children. Overall, there does not appear 
to  be  any  gender  bias  in  the  distribution  of  children  in  our  sample  as  49  per  cent  of  children  are 
girls.  Approximately  60  per  cent  of  families  have  their  own  house.  Almost  80  per  cent  reside  in 
urban areas. In addition, we observe that more than half of the households of the sample reside in 
the Southeast and Northeast regions of Brazil, each regions account for 27 per cent of households. 
The remaining 46 per cent is divided into: 17.5 for Central-West, 13.8 for South and 14.3 per cent 
for North region. 

Analysis of the consumption data suggests that, on average,  Brazilian households spend 26,6% of 
their budget on food for the whole sample. As expected, the percent of total expenditure over food 
expenditure  increases  as  the  number  of  children  in  the  household  increases,  standing  between 
25,2%  for  households  without  children  and  32,4%  for  households  with  three  children.  Now,  we 
consider how the budget shares destined for private assignable  goods change when the household 

                                                 
23  In  our  model  we  use  the  deviation  of  model  values  as  an  indicator  of  the  level  of  adult  education.  In  our  case,  the 
mode of education for both men and women is 8 years. 

composition  changes.  We  focus  first  on  the  expenditure  on  clothing.  Note  that  the  budget  share 
spent by women on clothing is higher than is spent by men, in all household compositions. In line 
with  expectations,  the  budget  share  on  clothing  expenditure  of  both  men  and  women  tend  to 
decrease  with  household  size.  Thus,  for  example,  in  household  without  children,  men  (women) 
allocate 1.6% (1.9%) of their resources on clothing while that in families with one and two children 
allocate 1.5% (1.9%) and 1.4% (1.6%) respectively. Another important finding in this preliminary 
inspection of the data concerns the fact that the budget share on private assignable good for children 
increases as the size of the household increases. This shifting of resources from adults to children is 
commonly known in the literature as ‘the cost of children’.

In this subsection, we show the results of our structural model. We begin presenting the parameters 
estimated  in  the  equation  (6)  for  each  household  member  by  family  size.  Then,  we  use  these 
estimated parameters to predict the resource shares. Tables 3 to 5 present the estimated coefficients 
and  their  standard  errors  for  the  specification  (6)  for  men,  women  and  children’s  equations, 
respectively.  The  results  by  household  types  are  presented  from  columns  (1)  to  (4).  In  particular, 
column (1) show the estimation for childless couples. Columns (2) until the column (4) presents the 

results  obtained  for  couples  with  one,  two  and  three  children  respectively.  We  clarify  that  our 
results should be understood as the statistical correlation of the variables with the resource shares, 
and not as a causal effect.     

We first consider the estimated coefficients for men’s equation presented in Table 3. As expected, 
the education level matters. Men’s resource shares increases with their education level, but decrease 
with women education. The estimated parameters are statistically significant for almost all sizes of 
households considered, except for families with three children. Each extra year of education of the 
men,  everything  else  equal,  increases  his  resource  share  by  around  4.12,  1.72,  1.16  and  1.82 
percentage points for childless couples, couples with one, two and third children, respectively. This 
result is in line with previous studies developed by Dunbar et al. (2013) and Azimi (2015), and can 
be understood as a gain  in the bargaining power of men as a result of a higher level of education. 
On the other hand, the participation of women in the labor market seems  to divert resources from 
men. The coefficients are negative and statistically significant for couples without children and with 
one  child  at  level  of  5%.  Finally,  note  that  demographics  characteristics  do  appear  to  have 
significant effects over  the men’s resource share.  In particular, man living in urban areas seem  to 
receive more resources for all type of household, except for household with third children.

Table  4  shows  the  estimated  parameters  of  women’s  equation.  We  highlight  some  important 
coefficients.  Firstly,  a  higher  women’s  education  is  associated  with  increases  of  her  resources,  at 
less until couples with two children24. Unexpectedly, the coefficient for couples with three children 
presents a negative sign, but it is not statistically significant. This result is consistent with finding in 
the men’s equation, where a higher women’s education implies less resources for men. A positive 
effect is also find if the woman participates in the labor market. We have found that both a higher 
level  of  education  and  participation  in  the  labor  market  of  women  can  influence  the  allocation  of 
resources  within  the  household.  Thus,  these  variables  can  be  interpreted  as  a  distribution  factor, 
which  implies  a  greater  bargaining  power  of  women  reflected  in  the  ability  to  obtain  a  greater 
proportion of household resources. In addition, women that live in Northeast region have a negative 
impact  on  her  resource  shares  in  household  without  and  one  child.  The  same  cannot  be  said  for 
women  residing  in  the  South  region,  where  we  find  a  positive  effect  for  the  same  household 
structure. Other positive and significant effect is observed if the women live in a household located 
in urban area 

                                                 
24 These results differ from those found by Iglesias (2016). However, he cannot offer conclusive evidence regarding this 
variable. 

Another interesting finding are related with age of woman. We find that woman’s age seems to be 
negative  related  on  her  resource  shares.  More  specifically,  in  families  composed  by  one  and  two 
children, an additional year reduce by around 1.1 and 9.3 percentage points the women’s resources, 
respectively.  This  result  align  with  the  finding  in  Calvi  (2015)  and  Azimi  (2015),  although  the 
coefficients  that  we  found  are  considerably  different  in  its  magnitude.  A  possible  explication  for 
this  result  is  that  the  women  lose  bargaining  power  inside  of  family,  because  as  they  grow  older 
they could become less productive.

The results reported in Table 5 refer to coefficient for children’s equation. The most salient result is 
that  children’s  age  has  a  positive  influence  on  their  resource  shares.  The  coefficients  amount  to 
0.00635 for couples with one child while it amounts to 0.00102 and 0.00383 for couples with two 
and three children, respectively. The estimated coefficient are statistically significant at level of 1% 
for  families  with  one  child  and  at  level  of  5%    for  the  rest  of  household  type.  Similar  results  are 
found by  Bargain  et  al.  (2014). On the other hand, a negative and significant  effect  is  observed if 
children  live  in  a  household  located  in  the  Northeast  of  Brazil.  In  contrast,  living  in  urban  areas 
seems a positive influence on their resources.  

It is also useful to note that the education parameters of both father and mother are only statistically 
significant in couples with one or two children. To be more precise,  an additional year of father’s 
(mother’s) education increases the resources designated for their children in  approximately 1.02% 
(3.09%)  for  couples  with  one  child  and  2.30%  (2.09%)  for  couples  with  two  children.  As  can  be 
observed, the impact is greater when looking the parameters related with the level of education of 
the mother in household with one child. One possible interpretation for this outcome might be that 
mothers  that  are  more  educated  have  greater  bargaining  power  and  may  have  more  influence  on 
family  decisions.  Educated  women  are  likely  to  be  more  concerned  about  the  well-being  of  their 
children, and therefore  may  give up part of their resources or their partner’s resources to  increase 
the resources of their children, improving their well-being. Similar result is found by Azimi (2015), 
who  found  that  in  rural  areas  the  mother’s  education  diverts  resources  from  the  father  to  the 
children.  In  this  sense,  our  results  suggest  that  public  policies  should  focus  their  efforts  on 
improving mothers’ education levels as a mechanism to improve the well-being of children. Finally, 
we  did  not  find  conclusive  evidence  of  gender  bias  in  favor  of  sons.  In  this  issue,  Braido  et  al. 
(2012) did  not find  evidence that support the  existence of  gender bias on household  decisions for 
Brazilian families either.            

 

4.3. Estimates of Resource Shares. 

For  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  intra-household  allocation  process,  we  take  the  estimated 
parameters  presented  in  Tables  3  to  5  and  we  use  them  to  predict  the  resource  shares  of  each 
household  member  by  type  of  family,  the  main  object  of  this  study.  Table  6  summarize  the 
descriptive  statistics  of  theses  inequality  measures.  All  the  estimated  resource  shares  take  as 
household reference those households for which all socio-demographic variables are equal to zero, 
as  was  mentioned  in  previous  section.  In  general  terms,  we  see  that  resource  shares  are  slightly 
larger for men than women in all family types analyzed. In particular, in column (1) is observed that 
men absorb on average a 53.2 per cent of household resources in childless couples. Consequently, 
women’s resources are only, on average, 87.9 per cent of the men’s resources (the remaining 46.8  
per cent of total family resources)25. The columns (3), (5) and (7) show the share for couples with 
one, two and three children, respectively. The average of men’s resource shares for households with 
one child is estimated in 41 per cent, but decreases as the number of children increases. Thus, we 
find that this shares standing to 37.5 per cent for couples with two children, while is around 35.6 per 
cent  for  couples  with  three  children.  These  results  are  very  similar  to  those  obtained  by  Iglesias 
(2016), who find that the men receive about 41 per cent of family resources, while women and child 
extract around 39 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.   

In general, our result can be put in the same line of the existing literature. In particular with those 
developed  by  Dunbar  et  al.  (2013)  and  Azimi  (2015),  who  found  that  men  absorb  a  greater 
proportion of household resources than women in Malawi and Iran. Opposite results are obtained by 
Bargain  et  al.  (2014)  on  Ivorian  data,  where  women  seem  to  have  greater  bargaining  power  than 
men within the household.      

Our results suggest that in Brazilian families there is inequality in the allocation of resources within 
the  household  in  favor  of  men26.  The  gap  between  men  and  women  in  the  resources  is 
approximately of 6.4 percentage points in childless couples. Although this gap is relatively smaller 
in other types of family composition, it is still favorable to men. In particular, the gap is 0.4, 2.9 and 
2.1  for  families  composed  of  one,  two  and  three  children  respectively.  This  result  is  important 
insofar as the men - woman gap in resource allocation is significantly reduced when children begin 
to be part of the family.  Furthermore, note that the level of the total share of household resources 
                                                 
25 Of course, these shares should sum to one according to the restrictions imposed by the model.   
26  This  result  does  not  necessarily  imply  inequality  in  welfare  terms,  and  it  should  be  understood  as  inequality  in  the 
distribution of resources. 

devoted to children rise as the number of children increases, but the average share allocated to each 
child  declines.  Estimations  of  the  average  children’s  share  increase  in  a  plausible  way  with 
household size ranging 0.23 to 0.30, while the resource share per child ranging 0.23 to 0.10.   

One  last  comment  regarding  the  results  is  in  order.  As  mentioned  above,  as  the  family  size 
increases, the proportion of resources allocated to parents decreases to  compensate the increase in 
the  proportion  of  resources  received  by  children.  A  good  question  is:  who  bears  in  greater 
proportion the cost of children? The father or the mother? Is the cost divided in equal proportions? 
Our results suggests that women’s resource shares drop by about 7 percentage points as the number 
of  children  goes  from  one  to  three,  while  the  men’s  resource  shares  falls  in  approximately  6 
percentage points. This implies that the cost of the children falls relatively in the same proportion 
for adult members, a percentage point more on the mothers. This result differs from the finding of 
Azimi  (2015)  who  find  that  women’s  resource  shares  are  most  affected  than  of  their  partners. 
Another result is presented by Dunbar et al. (2013), who find that men’s resource share increases as 
the family size increases, at least between families of one and three children. Men’s resource share 
increase from 0.40 in household with one child to 0.46 in household with three children of Malawi. 
This finding is totally opposite from ours.

4.4. Heterogeneity across Region. 

Some studies that assess inequality in Brazil found that regional difference in income distribution is 
the main cause of inequality (see e.g.,  AZZONI  et  al.,  2003). Demographic aspects  could  play an 
important role in the inequality between families and/or individuals due to differences in economic 
environment,  population  composition,  cultural  aspects,  population  growth,  among  others.  De 
Menezes et al. (2012) analyzes the regional inequality evolution of income for different age cuts for 
Brazil.  They  show  evidence  that  regional  inequality  is  diminishing  for  the  older  cohorts  and  is 
increasing,  or  non-diminishing,  for  the  younger  cohorts.  This  evidence  inspire  our  next  analysis, 
because regional differences could lead to heterogeneous results in the analysis of the allocation of 
resources inside of the households, in particular the proportion of resources devoted to individuals 
considered as vulnerable members, such as children. To capture these possible heterogeneities, we 
estimate  our  model  structure  separately  by  region,  then  with  the  estimated  parameters  we  recover 
the resource shares for each household member27. 

Table  7  show  the  estimated  resource  shares  by  region.  Again,  our  results  provide  evidence  of 
inequality in the intra-household allocation of resources in the Brazilian families, which leads us to 
the rejection of unitary approach. Families residing in the Southeast region seems to distribute their 
resources  more  equally  among  their  members.  Our  findings  show  that  men,  women  and  children 
receive about 33 per cent of household resources, respectively. However, although this distribution 

                                                 
27 The estimated coefficients of the covariates for each type of household member for the analyses of region are 
available upon request.   

appears  to  be  egalitarian,  children  continue  to  be  disadvantaged,  because  on  average  each  child 
absorbs  only  about  11  per  cent  of  family  resources28.  Contrary  to  expectations,  similar  results  are 
find  for  the  Northeast  region.  In  fact,  different  from  previous  results,  women  receive  a  slightly 
higher  proportion  of  household  resources  than  the  rest  of  the  household  members.  In  addition, 
children in the North region appear to be the least favored of the entire sample considered here. On 
average,  each  child  receives  only  about  7.3  per  cent  of  household  resources,  while  their  father 
absorbs  38.6  per  cent  and  their  mother  pull  out  about  40.1  per  cent.  Finally,  in  the  Central-West 
region,  men  and  women  receive  around  23.6  per  cent  and  45.4  per  cent  of  the  family  resources, 
respectively.  The  children,  meanwhile,  extract  the  31  per  cent  remaining.  Our  results  show  that 
there is heterogeneity in the distribution of resources across the different regions, this suggests that 
public policy that seeks to combat inequality should not ignore regional characteristics because their 
effects could be totally different across regions.

5.  Final Remarks. 

This research applied the collective consumption model developed by Dunbar et al. (2013) in order 
to  analyze  economic  inequality  among  individuals  of  Brazilian  families.  To  achieve  this,  we 
identified  the  so-called  resource  shares,  which  are  considered  useful  measures  of  individual 
consumption expenditure and can be estimated directly from household level data. In particular, we 
identified each member’s share of total  household  consumption through his  or her expenditure  on 
private  assignable  good.  We  focused  only  on  traditional  families  (families  composed  solely  of 
father,  mother  and  their  children).  Moreover,  by  empirical  requirements,  we  only  considered 
families with zero to three children. Our empirical results reveal the existence of inequality in the 
allocation of resources inside the household.  In  particular,  we  find that  Brazilian families  allocate 
more resources toward men than women. To be more precise, we show that the gap between men 
and  women  in  the  distribution  of  resources  is  approximately  of  6.4  percentage  points  in  childless 
couples,  but  this  difference  decreases  as  the  family  size  increases.  In  this  sense,  given  the  intra-
household inequality that we had found, analyses based on the unitary model  could lead to biased 
estimates.  

In  general,  we  have  shown  that  there  is  an  inequality  in  the  allocation  of  resources  in  Brazilian 
families,  which  has  traditionally  been  ignored  both  by  researchers  and  by  public  policy  makers, 
providing a picture incomplete and biased, especially when taking into consideration the children in 
the analyses. Thus, our research gives a step in the understanding of the process of distribution of 
resources within the household, which can be considered as an input for policy makers about how to 
target  individuals  effectively  within  households  in  order  to  minimize  the  incidence  of  childhood 
inequality.  This  will  be  possible  if  public  policies  are  addressed  to  some  type  of  individuals  or 
group of individuals within households such that they can have an impact. Our study also make a 
clarion  call  to  the  income  redistributive  policies.  This  suggests  that  the  design  of  such  policies 

                                                 
28 Remember that in these estimates we aggregated all families that have children. 

should  take  into  account  the  potential  intra-household  inequalities  in  order  to  define  more  clearly 
the target audience of social programs  

Finally,  we  point  out  some  limitations  of  our  work  that  may  motivate  future  research.  First,  the 
analysis  presented  here  is  static.  Future  researches  should  consider  the  dynamics  in  the  intra-
household resources allocation. Analysis over time would provide a broader view of the allocation 
of resources among household members. Second, to the best of my knowledge, for the specific case 
of Brazil, there are no studies that consider intra-household production to understand the allocation 
of resources. So future analyses could fill that gap.
