Abstract

In this paper we examine the joint eﬀect of compulsory savings and unfunded social se-
curity on the macroeconomic equilibrium in an economy populated by heterogeneous and
overlapping generations individuals. Our model economy is informed by the Brazilian expe-
rience, where a social security structure with high and progressive replacement ratios com-
bined with a forced savings system with lower than market returns remuneration. Those
institutional features coexist with extremely high real interest rates and low voluntary sav-
ing rates. We examine the links between those facts by simulating such model calibrated
with Brazilian data and performing counterfactual exercises. Reducing pensions replace-
ment ratios to levels comparable to US leads to substantial increase in the savings rates
and modest reduction in real interest rates. Similar results are obtained when forced sav-
ings interest rates are increased from the current below market levels. Keywords: social
security, pay as you go, individual retirement accounts, unemployment and longevity risks

1 Introduction

The growth and welfare eﬀects of the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and capitalization social se-
curity systems are extensively discussed in the literature, as well as the transition from the
former to the latter. Among others, see the inﬂuent works of ? and ?.1 Due to population
aging that turns the current replacement ratios of PAYG unsustainable, its combination with
individual capitalization accounts is one more time considered as a device to generate the
additional savings necessary to support retirees’ standard of living for longer (?).

Brazil features both a pay-as-you-go social security system with high and progressive re-

placement rates, and forced savings in capitalization accounts with lower than market reumuner-
ation rates. At the same time, real interest rates are among the highest in the world, and vol-
untary savings are very low. In this paper we examine the joint eﬀect of compulsory savings
and unfunded social security on the macroeconomic equilibrium in an model economy with
heterogeneous and overlapping generations individuals.

2

To further describe the social security in our model economy, individuals have their wage
taxed at a ﬁxed rate and retire at a certain age (65 years old in Brazil), when they start to re-
ceive pensions at replacement ratios that are inversely related to their permanent incomes.2
Additionally, workers mandatorily get paid an extra 8% of their gross labor income in indi-
vidual savings accounts, called Service Time Guarantee Fund (FGTS), that accumulates until
retirement at rates below market. The FGTS savings cannot be freely withdrawn before the
retiring age and thus constitute another mechanism to countervail the low propensity to save
of myopic agents. 3

Because individuals have diﬀerent abilities, incomes and mortality risks, and are subject to
borrowing constraints, aggregate and distributive equilibrium eﬀects of those institutions are
non-trivial. The progressive replacement ratios have distributive eﬀects. However, compul-
sory savings earn below market returns and subsidize physical capital investments. Eventual
deﬁcits in the social security are ﬁnanced by additional taxes.4

We study the eﬀects of those institutional features by simulating such a model and per-
forming counter-factual exercises. We examine the joint and separate role of those two so-
cial security devices in the equilibrium economy. First, we compare the mixed system (called
"Benchmark") with one where the FGTS forced saving mechanism is abolished. Since forced
savings help to ﬁnance subsidized loans in this economy, its extinction lowers the aggregate
physical capital, output and wages, simultaneously generating a ﬁscal deﬁcit that has to be
compensated by a tax increase. Voluntary savings rates rise substantially, but not enough to
compensate for the elimination of forced savings, resulting in lower total savings. With lower
output and wages, all agents get worse oﬀ. The wealth inequality also increases.

In our second exercise we bring down the very high Brazilian pension replacement ratios
to the U.S. levels. As expected, this reform lowers taxes, increases both voluntary and total
savings rates, and substantially reduces interest rates. With greater equilibrium physical
capital than in the Benchmark, the economy produces higher output and wages that makes
agents better oﬀ.

Finally increasing the FGTS remuneration (another reform discussed in the Brazilian
Congress) makes it a more eﬃcient wealth accumulation instrument, resulting in higher forced
and total savings and lower market interest rates. Again, with higher physical capital, output
and wages, wealth inequality goes down. Given that workers’ FGTS balances accounts are
proportional to their wages, their welfare variation depends on the ﬁscal regime. While high
ability workers always improve, low ability ones get much better in the proportional wage tax
regime and much worse in the lump-sum ﬁnancing regime.

Our counterfactual exercises point out that both a decrease in replacement ratios and an
increase in the forced savings remuneration are reforms that could lead to substantial in-
creases in the total saving rates and reductions in the market interest rates, with positive
consequences for growth and wealth inequality.

The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 brieﬂy reviews the related literature. Section
3 presents our model economy. The following section explains how we calibrate the model
parameters in order to represent relevant features of the Brazilian economy. Section 5 displays
2This unfunded pension system compensates under-savings and insure families from unemployment and death

risks. However, we do not model the unemployment insurance feature.

3In reality the fund can be withdrawal if the worker is ﬁred or if she buys her ﬁrst house, provided that its price

is lower than a stipulated value.

4The fast aging process of the Brazilian population is placing the ﬁscal situation under increasing ﬁnancial
stress. Here we abstract from the demographic transition and thus from ﬁscal sustainability issues. With an
"stable-equivalent" age distribution, we assume that the budget is balanced every period through wage or lump-
sum taxes.

preliminary remarks and directions for future research.

2 Related Literature and the Brazilian Social Security

3

The macroeconomic eﬀects of the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and capitalization social security
systems are extensively discussed in the literature. Eﬀects on labor supply, savings behavior,
taxes and interest rates, as well as their eﬃciency and welfare consequences were initially
studied in a fully rational decision making framework, as in ? and ?, usually concluding that
social security serves as a redistribution device across generations. 5

Incorporating the fundamental aspects that social security was introduced to prevent my-
opic individuals from inadequate savings for retirement, and as a substitute to the miss-
ing market for annuities, the literature in the early 2000s was extended to allow for time-
inconsistent individuals. Studies like ?, ?, and others show that time-inconsistent agents value
social security as a commitment device to save.

Another limitation of the 1990s literature was to consider only steady state eﬀects of social
security. It is necessary to compute the transition path between steady states and separate
intergenerational redistribution from eﬃciency eﬀects. An exact calculation must compensate
income eﬀects of generations in a separate simulation, as in ? or ?.

Increasing concerns with population aging bring to the foreground the issues of suitability
and sustainability of the PAYG system in an era of higher dependency ratio (i.e., the ratio of
the number of people aged 0-14 and 65-over divided by the number of people aged 15-64). For
example, ? show that in an aging society, taxes would have to almost double (reaching more
than 50% of the GDP) to aﬀord for the current beneﬁt-wage ratio of the PAYG retirement
system, hindering investments and per-capita growth.

Capitalization accounts are again considered as a device to generate the additional savings
necessary to fund more years in retirement. For example, ? and ? study the introduction
of individual retirement accounts to supplement the existing PAYG system in the U.S. and
Germany respectively.

Given the evidence on the importance of illiquid assets for life cycle savings modelling (see

?), housing seems an important aspect of the problem (see ? and ?).

In this context, Brazil is particularly interesting, given its costly mixed PAYG-capitalization
social security system that promisses high average replacement ratio, though not necessarily
progressive or proportional. To ﬁnance current pensioners in a PAYG scheme, the Brazilian
formal sector worker is taxed 8% to 11% of his (her) wage, with an additional 20% contribu-
tion made by the employer. Additionally, the employer mandatorily deposits an extra 8% of
the worker wage in an individual account, called the Service Time Guarantee Fund (FGTS).
The worker cannot withdraw from this account unless she is ﬁred, become disable or retire.
Thus, FGTS is a particular kind of illiquid asset and constitutes an endowment for retirement,
like an individual retirement account (IRA). Although the FGTS accumulates at below market
interest rates, ? show that it signiﬁcantly supplement wealth to ﬁnance constant consumption
habits during retirement.

The Brazilian state paternalism also extends to ﬁrms’ investments, and a signiﬁcant por-
tion of the FGTS (and other government managed "workerks’ support" funds) is used to ﬁnance
capital investments at below market interest rates, as studied in ?.

5? and ? are examples of similar analyses for Brazil.

4

In this paper, we incorporate the Brazilian social security system and investments sub-
sidies into a general equilibrium model with time-consistent consumers that are borrowing
constrained, have diﬀerent abilities, income and mortality risks. We study the aggregate and
distributive equilibrium eﬀects of those institutions, their consequences to growth and welfare.

3 The Environment

At each point in time, the economy is inhabited by multiple cohorts of individuals of diﬀer-
ent ages. Each cohort is comprised of a continuum of measure one of individuals who live for
a ﬁnite, albeit random, number of periods.

3.1 Demography

Each period, t, a new generation is born. For an individual born in date t, uncertainty
regarding the time of death is captured by the fact that he or she faces a probability ψt+1 of
surviving to the age t + 1 conditional on being alive at age t. Hence, an individual born in
k=1 ψt+k. We also assume that there is T > 0 such that

t is alive in t + J with probability(cid:81)J

For most of our analysis we will focus on the steady-state allocations. Since it greatly
simpliﬁes the presentation we shall drop all time indices from aggregate variables and use t
to represent age.

We may map the survival probability into the time invariant age proﬁle of the population
t=0. Letting gn denote the population growth rate, the fraction of agents t years

denoted {µt}T
old in the population is found using the following law of motion

ψT +1 = 0.

with µt ≥ 0, and(cid:80)T

t=0 µt = 1.

µt =

ψt

1 + gn

µt−1,

3.2 Households
Individuals derive utility from consumption, c, and leisure, 1 − l. We use a
Preferences
quasi-hyperbolic preference in line with ?. In this set-up, per period utility is discounted by
1, β, β2, β3, .... Given that  is used only to discount utility from the current period and
the next and β is used to discount future utility every period, they are called short-term and
long-term discount factors, respectively.

The preference over lifetime consumption and leisure of an individual of age t is deﬁned as

follows:

where Et is the expectation operator conditional on the information available to the individual

for γ > 0 and γ (cid:54)= 1, where ρt ∈ (0, 1) ∀t allows preferences over consumption-leisure to vary
with age.

Budget constraints Every period, individuals choose labor supply, consumption and asset
accumulation to maximize their objective, (??), subject to a budget constraint which we shall
explain momentarily.

An individual of age t who works for l hours supplies to the market a total of ltsteu+zt ef-
ﬁciency units which are paid at a wage rate w. The variable u ∼ N (0, σ2
u) is a permanent
component of an individual’s skills. It is realized at birth and retained throughout one’s life.
On the other hand, z evolves stochastically according to an AR(1) process, zt = ϕzzt−1 + εt,
with innovations εt ∼ N (0, σ2
ε ). Whereas u aims at capturing the heterogeneity at birth, ev-
eryone’s most relevant lottery, z is the main source of uncertainty that aﬀects one’s choices.
The parameter ϕz accommodates the empirically observed persistence of productivity shocks.
st is the age-eﬃciency proﬁle, which is deterministic and intend to capture the age component
of the life-cycle earnings.

Each person has a unit time endowment which can be used in market related activities,
or directly consumed in the form of leisure, 1 − l. Labor productivity shocks are independent
across agents. As a consequence, there is no uncertainty regarding the aggregate labor en-
dowment even though there is uncertainty at the individual level.

All workers in this economy pay taxes (τw, Tss(.), τf gts). Ideally, the revenue from τw ﬁ-
nances overall government expenditures not related to the social security system. The Tss(.) =
τssmin., ymax is the used to ﬁnance the beneﬁt payments to the retirees, where τss is the con-
tribution rate and ymax = 2.3ym with ym for the average wage. In addition, employers make
a compulsory contribution, τf gts, to their employees FGTS accounts. Households can also be
taxed lump-sum, T . Thus, the worker after-tax labor income is given by:

yt = (1 − τw)(1 − τf gts)wtltsteu+zt − τssmin{(1 − τf gts)wtltsteu+zt, ymax} − T

(3)
At the age of Tr = 65, individuals retire and start collecting social security beneﬁts, which
we denoted by b(u). In order to capture the correlation between pensions and life-cycle earn-
ings, we allow the beneﬁts to depend on the permanent shock. In particular, we assume that:

(4)
where θ(u) = θ0 + θ1u is the retirement replacement ratio and ym(u) is the average life-cycle
earnings conditioned on u. The system is progressive, with θ1 < 0.

yt = b(u) = θ(u)ym(u) − T

Individuals can trade an ordinary risk-free asset which holdings we denote by aord,t. Or-
dinary asset holdings are subject to an exogenous lower bound. More precisely, we assume
that agents are not allowed to contract debt at any age, so that the amount of ordinary assets
carried over from age t to t + 1 is such that aord,t+1 ≥ 0. Because no agent can hold a negative
position in ordinary assets at any time, we assume without loss that assets take the form of
capital, as in ?.

6The reason for allowing ρ to depend on age is to better match the actual behavior of hours worked over the

life-cycle. This is important in our case given the nature of the exercises we study.

T(cid:88)

ˆ

6

At each age, individuals total wealth, at = (aord,t +af gts,t), is the sum of the ordinary assets,
aord,t+1, and the illiquid FGTS account balance, af gts,t. The budget constraints for workers aged
t = 1, ..., Tr − 1 are:

ct + aord,t+1 = (1 + r)aord,t + (1 − τw)(1 − τf gts)wtltsteu+zt

− τssmin{(1 − τf gts)wtltsteu+zt, ymax} − T + 

(5)

and

af gts,t+1 = (1 + rf gts)af gts,t + τf gtswtltsteu+zt

(6)
where  is a lump-sum involuntary bequests left by those who die before reaching age T + 1,
and the rate of return on the FGTS rf gts is deﬁned by the government. For simplicity, all assets
of agents who died are collected and redistributed among all agents alive in the economy on a
lump-sum basis:

 =

µt

(1 − ψt+1)[(1 + r)aord,t + (1 + rf gts)af gts,t]dλt

(7)

t=1

Ω

Individuals are allowed to withdraw their FGTS account balances only upon retirement at

the age Tr. Thus, the budget constraints for new retirees are:

cTr + aord,Tr+1 = (1 + r)aord,Tr + (1 + rf gts)af gts,Tr + b(u) − T + 

and

with the budget constraint for retirees aged t = Tr + 1, ..., T simplifying to:

af gts,Tr+1 = 0

ct + aord,t+1 = (1 + r)aord,t + b(u) +  − T

Recursive Formulation of Households’ Problem

(8)

(9)

(10)

Let ω = (aord,t, af gts,t, u, zt) denote the individual state-space. The choice problem of work-

ers, aged t = 1, ..., Tr − 1, can be recursively represented as follows:

:(cid:2)Ut(c, 1 − l) + βψt+1Ez(cid:48) ¯Vw,t+1(ω(cid:48))(cid:3) ,

(11)

Vw,t(ω) = max
ord≥0
subject to the budget (??) and (??).

l,a(cid:48)

Let a(cid:48)

ord = da,t(ω) and l = dl,t(ω) denote the solution of the problem above. Thus, the value

function on the right-hand side is updated as follows:

¯Vw,t(ω) = Ut(c, 1 − l) + βψt+1Ez(cid:48) ¯Vw,t+1(ω(cid:48))

where

c + da,t(ω) = (1 + r)aord + (1 − τw)(1 − τf gts)wdl,t(ω)seu+z

− τssmin{(1 − τf gts)wdl,t(ω)seu+z, ymax} − T + 

(12)

(13)

Notice that, due to the time-inconsistency problem associated with the quasi-hyperbolic

discounting preference, the recursive formulation is such that agents choose next period ordi-
nary assets and hours worked applying the discount factor β, but the actual value function is
evaluated with the discount factor β.

The optimization problem of retirees, aged t = Tr, ..., T, can similarly be written as follows:

:(cid:2)Ut(c, 1) + βψt+1 ¯Vr,t+1(ω(cid:48))(cid:3) ,

Vr,t(ω) = max
ord≥0
a(cid:48)

(14)

subject to the budget constraints (??) and (??), or (??), where ¯Vr,t is updated according to:

ord, u)

¯Vr,t(aord, u) = Ut(c, 1) + βψt+1 ¯Vr,t+1(a(cid:48)

(15)
It should be stressed that we have imposed non-negativity constraints on asset holdings.
We have thus taken an extreme (albeit plausible) position with regards to capital markets.
Relaxing a little the assumption by allowing some exogenous limit is likely to have little eﬀect
on our conclusions, at the cost of introducing a whole new set of issues that would have to be
dealt with to maintain the internal consistency of the model.

Also important is the fact that we have only used individual state variables in ω. It is
apparent that prices do enter the value function. Indeed, in solving the model we will need to
ﬁnd the equilibrium prices by explicitly taking into account how they enter the policy functions
associated with (??) and (??).

3.3 The Government

In our economy, there is one government budget constraint that encompasses both the tax

system and the pension system. It is given by:

G + Gss + rf gtsKf gts =

T(cid:88)

µt

t=1

ˆ

Ω

([τf gts + τw(1 − τf gts)]wtltsteu+zt+

(16)

τssmin{(1 − τf gts)wtltsteu+zt, ymax})dλt + ¯rKf gts + T

where G is an exogenous stream of regular government spending, Gss =

µt

b(u)dλt is the

social security expenditure on pensions and Kf gts is the total wealth deposited in the FGTS.
The above equation implies that the government consolidates its regular government spending
together with the mixed PAYG-capitalization social security system. The pension beneﬁts
are ﬁnanced through the combination of wage-proportional social security and regular labor
income taxes, respectively τss and τw, an eventual interest rate spread (¯r − rf gts) on the total
FGTS managed, and a lump-sum tax T . The amount of beneﬁts received by each retired agent
was presented in the last section.

In the simulations below, we allow two forms of ﬁscal budget adjustment: (i) τw adjusts to
ensure that government budget constraint is satisﬁed; or (ii) the lump-sum tax T adjusts to
ensure that government budget constraint is satisﬁed. We assume τss is exogenous. As ex-
plained before, the government manages a compulsory savings program represented by the
Service Time Guarantee Fund (FGTS). Under this program, employers deposit 8% of the pay-
roll in an account in the name of the employee. The interest rate on these deposits, rf gts, is
determined by the government and thus is a policy parameter in our model.

3.4 Production

Except for some government subsidy to capital, the production side is standard. The tech-
nology for producing the consumption good is summarized by a Cobb-Douglas production func-
tion with constant returns to scale,

Y = BKαN 1−α,

where K is aggregate capital, N is aggregate eﬃcient units of labor, and B is a scale parameter.

Every period, the representative ﬁrm solves the static optimization problem

K,N

where r is the market rental rate of physical capital, ¯r is the government subsidised interest
rate, w is the wage rate and φ is the share of the aggregate capital that is subsided. Given the
government has Kf gts to lend, φK = Kf gts. Note that we assume that the rental rate of capital
is net of depreciation costs which are born directly by the ﬁrm.

3.5 Recursive competitive equilibrium

In all that follows we describe the recursive equilibrium in a steady state. This greatly
simpliﬁes the presentation. Moreover it dispenses the distinction between age and time thus
signiﬁcantly reducing the notational burden.

At each point in time, agents diﬀer from one another with respect to age t and to state
vector ω = (aord,t, af gts,t, u, zt) ∈ Ω. Agents of age t, identiﬁed by their individual states ω, are
distributed according to a probability measure λt deﬁned on Ω, as follows.
η ∈ (cid:122)(Ω), λt(η) denotes the fraction of agents aged t that are in η.

Let (Ω, (cid:122)(Ω), λt) be a space of probability, where (cid:122)(Ω) is the Borel σ-algebra on Ω. For each

Given the age t distribution, λt, Qt(ω, η) induces the age t + 1 distribution λt+1 as follows.
The function Qt(ω, η) determines the probability of an agent at age t and state ω to transit
to the set η at age t + 1. In turn, Qt(ω, η) depends on the policy functions in (??) and on the
exogenous stochastic process for z.

A recursive competitive equilibrium for the economy is as follows.

Deﬁnition 1. Given the policy parameters {G, b(u), rf gts, Kf gts, τw, τss, ¯r,T }, a recursive com-
petitive equilibrium for the economy is a collection of value functions {Vw,t(ω), Vr,t(ω)}, pol-
icy functions for ordinary asset holdings da,t(ω) and labor supply dl,t(ω) (implying consumption
ct(ω) and FGTS assets af gts,t+1(ω)), prices {w, r}, age dependent but time-invariant measures
of agents λt(ω), and accidental bequest  such that:

(i) da,t(ω), dl,t(ω) solve the dynamic problems in (??) and (??) subject to the given constraints;

4 Calibration

Y = C + (1 + gn)K − (1 − δ)K + G

To carry out our quantitative analysis, we need ﬁrst to ﬁnd values for all the parameters

of the model. We accomplish this by calibrating the model to the Brazilian economy.

The population age proﬁle {µt}T

t=1 depends on the population growth rate, gn, the survival
probabilities, ψt, and the maximum age, T, that an agent can live. Agents enter the economy
at age 20 and may live for 71 years, T = 71, so that the maximum age is 90 years old.

Data on survival probability by age are from Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
(IBGE). Given the survival probabilities, the population growth rate is chosen so that the age
distribution in the model replicates the dependency ratio observed in the data. By setting
gn = 0.012, the model generates a dependency ratio of 13%, which is close to the dependency
ratio observed in the data for 2008.

[plain] Calibration
To calibrate the preference parameters we proceed as follows. First, we set  = 1 and
choose the discount factor β in such a way that the equilibrium of our benchmark economy
implies a capital-output ratio around of 2.5, which is the value observed in the data. Then we
ﬁx the parameter γ to 4.0, from micro evidence, and choose the share of leisure in the utility
function, ρt, to match average ours for diﬀerent age groups. In particular, we assume that
ρt = ρ0 + ρ1t. To calibrate ρ0, we use the average working hours for ages 12 − 40 and for ρ1 the
average between 41 − 60. The ﬁrst group works on average 37.86% while the second 40.37% of
their time endowment. For the last 5 years we specify a new proﬁle ρt = ρ60 + ρ2t. We calibrate
ρ2 to match the average time worked during those last ﬁve years equal to 35.16%.7

To explore the implications of hyperbolic discounting, we also study economies in which
 < 1. In particular, we consider the cases where  = 0.85 and  = 0.60. For each value of ,
we only adjust β to generate the same capital to output ratio of 2.5.

 . In Brazil, due to the lack of a household panel data
survey, such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in the U.S., we cannot estimate ϕ prop-
erly. Thus, we set ϕz = 0.95 based on the evidence for the U.S. economy and then calibrate σ2
to match the income Gini at age 60, which was 0.54 in 2008 according to the PNAD. This pro-
cedure provides a value for σ2

The values of the technological parameters (α, δ) are also in Table ??. We chose a value for
K/Y −g. We
the capital, α, of 0.36 based on ?. The depreciation rate, in turn, is obtained by δ = I/Y
set the investment-product ratio I/Y equal to 0.19 and the capital-product ratio K/Y equal to
2.5. The economic growth rate, g, is constant and consistent with the average growth rate of
GDP over the second half of the last century. Based on data from Penn-World Table, we set g
equal to 2.2%, which yields a depreciation rate of nearly 5%.

The values for the actual age-eﬃciency proﬁle are constructed similarly to ? and ?. We
use annual earnings and annual hours worked for the age groups 15-24, 25-34,..., 75-84 from
PNAD. First, we construct hourly wages by dividing annual earnings by annual hours for each
age group. Afterwards, we use a second order polynomial to interpolate the points to obtain
the age-eﬃciency proﬁle by exact age.

Finally, we specify the others parameters related to government activity. First, we set gov-
ernment consumption, G, to 20% of the output of the economy under the baseline calibration.
The interest rate on FGTS assets is 3% plus the reference interest rate (TR), which was nearly
1%. Thus, considering an inﬂation rate of 7%, we have that the real return on FGTS deposits
is −3%, which is the value we use for rf gts in the benchmark economy.

As for Social Security, contributions are of the form Tss(y) = τss min{y, ymax}. The tax rate
for social security is 11% for the employee and 20% for the employer, so we set τss = 0.31. To
calibrate the contribution ceiling, we use the fact that in the data, ymax = 2.30ym, where ym
is the average labor income. We assume that the retirement replacement ratio is given by
θ(u) = θ0 + θ1u. We choose θ0 and θ1 in such a way that the replacement ratio of the lowest
ability individual is 1.00 and the average replacement ratio is 0.70, as is observed in the data.

Figure 2: Average proﬁles for the benchmark economy by type: Exponential vs Hyperbolic discounting

Averages may, of course, hide a rich diversity in life-cycle patterns. We split the individuals
in our economy in ﬁve diﬀerent ability groups. We group the agents in the high extreme of the
grid of the distribution of innate ability, u, and label them the high ability group. The agents on
the lowest extreme of the grid are labeled low ability. In Figure ??, we plot the same variables
considered in Figure ?? for those to groups to get a sense of the role of heterogeneity in our
model.

Life-cycle patterns are qualitatively similar for all groups and all models. However, the
humps in Figure ?? are more pronounced for the high ability individuals in all diﬀerent spec-
iﬁcations. That means high ability agents do work more hours, save more during the working
age, and can consume more during retirement than low ability ones. Those diﬀerences in life
cycle patterns between high and low ability households reﬂect the diﬀerence in social security
replacement rates, which is much higher for low ability workers.

5 Results

We present our analyses for two types of consumer preferences: exponential and hyperbolic
discounting. For each preference and alternative scenarios, we describe the respective steady
state under two ﬁscal policies: (A) τw is adjusted to balance government budget; or (B) the
government balances its budget through a lump-sum tax.

In column 2, without the compulsory FGTS, the total (private) savings of the economy co-
incide with the voluntary savings. Voluntary savings rates increase substantially, but not
enough to compensate the elimination of forced savings, resulting in lower total savings. Mar-
ket interest rates only marginally decrease and the equilibrium physical capital is smaller than

14

in the benchmark economy. Because forced savings ﬁnanced subsidized loans to capital, FGTS
extinction causes the aggregate capital level to go down. To pay a higher average return on
capital, the marginal product of capital has to be higher, which implies lower levels of K/Y, less
productive labor and lower wages. With ﬁxed government and social security expenditures,
the ﬁscal authority has to raise taxes to balance its budget. With lower output and (after-tax)
wages, all agents get worse oﬀ. Because most of the low ability individuals income comes from
their wages and wages are now lower, the Gini inequality also increases. When τw is adjusted
in panel 2.A, high ability agents end up paying more of the ﬁscal adjustment and low ability
agents do not lose as much as they would have if the ﬁscal adjustment choice were lump-sum
ﬁnancing in panel 2.B. Given taxes in panel 2.B are not dependent on hours worked, workers
choose to increase the hours worked under this regime.

Figure 3: Benchmark versus Eliminate the FGTS

In column 3 of Table ??, we see that a lower replacement ratio (from the Brazilian θBr = 0.70
to the U.S. θU S = 0.40) lowers the taxes needed to ﬁnance pensions and considerably increases
the need of voluntary savings for retirement. By accumulating more wealth, the ratio of capital
to output increases and the interest rate decreases. With greater equilibrium physical capital
than in the benchmark, the economy produces higher output. Labor is now more productive,
wages are higher, and wealth inequality slightly lower than in the benchmark. Because in the
endogenous τw regime (in panel 2.A), agents are now less taxed for working, they choose to
work more. Agents are better oﬀ in general, and the low ability types get even better in the
lump-sum tax regime (panel 2.B), where they enjoy a higher (than proportional to income) tax
reduction.

Column 4 of Table ?? shows the joint consequences of no compulsory FGTS savings and
a lower replacement ratios. The eﬀects of the latter seem to dominate in terms of improved
welfare, although output and before-tax wages are sligthly lower. These measures have the

In column 5 of Table ??, we analyze the eﬀects of a higher remuneration to the FGTS
(from -3% to 4.0% per year), which makes it a more eﬃcient wealth accumulation instrument.
The cumulative eﬀect of higher interest on the FGTS is substantial and, although workers
choose to save less voluntarily, total savings increase. The greater total savings lowers market
interest rates and increases the physical capital stock. With much more productive labor,
before-tax wages are higher and wealth inequality decreases. In this scenario, the government
has to raise taxes to pay for the higher FGTS remuneration. The higher τw (in panel 2.A)
distorts the labor market and workers choose to work less. They all get better oﬀ though,
given workers’ FGTS balances beneﬁtting from higher remuneration are also proportional to
their owners’ wages. However, because the additonal lump-sum tax contribution (in panel
2.B) is not proportional to the workers’ FGTS balance, low ability workers get much worse oﬀ,
paying more on taxes than they earned from higher wages and FGTS remuneration.

Figure 6: Benchmark versus Change rf gts to 4%

In column 6 of Table ??, we analyze the consequences of joint lower replacement ratios and
a higher remuneration to the FGTS. Given these reforms increase total savings, their eﬀects
add to each other, and physical capital, output and before-tax wages are the highest among
the considered counterfactuals. The wealth distribution improves almost as in column 5. The
opposite preassures on the ﬁscal budget bring taxes to somewhere between their pure reforms,
meaning tax increase relative to the benchmark. Recollecting that both the replacement ratio
and the FGTS are proportional-to-wage beneﬁts, if this joint reform is ﬁnanced through higher
τw, it proportionaly charges who beneﬁtted more. The net eﬀect on hours worked is small and
the welfare improves to all agents. One can notice that real interest rates in the benchmark
simulation is very high - 8%. This is even higher than the real rates found in Brazil. Thus, in
some sense, our model is able to reproduce this particular feature. When we change parame-
ters of the social security and compulsory savings, we are able to reduce this rate to 7.12%, still

Thus, the Brazilian forced savings and high replacement retirement systems
cannot explain why real interest rates are so high in Brazil.

6 Conclusions

Our counterfactual exercises suggest that both a decrease in replacement ratios and an
increase in the forced savings remuneration are sensible reforms that could lead to substantial
increases in the total saving rates, physical capital and output. With more productive workers
and higher before-tax wages, consumers are better oﬀ in the steady state if the necessary ﬁscal
adjustments are made through wage income tax.

This research is still quite preliminary and we plan to extend the analysis to the case of
myopic agents. So far, our results for exponential discounting agents seem to hold for time-
inconsistency agents as well.

Additionally, we plan to model the agents budget constraint more accuratly, better reﬂect-

ing the change in income and wealth from employment to unemployment.

Given the literature evidence on the importance of illiquid assets for life cycle savings mod-
elling (see ?), to better incorporate some important aspects of the FGTS seems another neces-
sary next step. Mainly its interaction with housing and unemployment.
