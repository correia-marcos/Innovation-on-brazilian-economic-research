Abstract

This article presents a neoclassical growth model with adjustment costs to investment
and a variety of different ﬁscal policies. The goal is to analyze how ﬁscal policies can
inﬂuence investment decision, capital accumulation and productivity. The model is cali-
brated using Brazilian data and a set of experiments is performed to investigate the effect of
different taxations. We ﬁnd that tax on private bonds return has the most signiﬁcant effect
on capital level and productivity. This ﬁnding comes from the fact that, in equilibrium,
an increase in taxation on bonds return decreases the present value of dividends and ﬁrm’s
value throughout real interest rate.
Keywords: Investment, Adjustment Cost, Fiscal Policy.

Introduction

The investment represents an essential element in the dynamics of any economy, whether in the
short or long term, especially for being one of the main components in the determination of
output, employment and income.

Casagrande (2002) considers that the investment sets, at the aggregate level, the economics
performance. Moreover, it is also a source of capital accumulation and, therefore, the major
determinant of the capability of the economy in the long run. Consists, according to the author,
on an unstable component of aggregate demand and responsible for variations in income and
employment.

Assumed its importance, there are a number of studies aimed to deﬁne the determinants of
investment. Analyzing the determinants of private investment in Brazil in the period 1970-1995,
Melo and Rodrigues J´unior (1999) found positive effects of aggregate demand on investment,
negative relationship between private and public investment in the short-term, positive inﬂu-
ence of the availability of demand credit and unfavorable impact of economic instability on
investment from the private sector. Ribeiro and Teixeira (2001) add the negative effect of large
currency devaluations on private investment.

In order to assess the effects of ﬁscal policy on investment, based on a panel of OECD
countries, Alesina et al. (1999) found a signiﬁcant negative effect of public spending on pri-
vate investment. This effect was more evident for the salary component of the public sector,
indicating the relevance of the public spending pressure on private investment.

Another important factor relative to investment is the tax burden, keeping an inverse re-
lationship between them. When analyzing in particular the Brazilian economy for the 2000s,
Giambiagi (2006), Pastore and Pinotti (2006) and Veloso (2006) show that the increasing tax
burden discourages private investment, which tends to reduce the potential growth of country.
As an alternative to the resumption of investment, these authors indicate a signiﬁcant reduction
in public spending and in the tax burden of the economy.

Furthermore, when estimating the elasticity of investment relative to Brazilian taxation,
Santos and Pires (2009) indicates that an increase of 1% in tax rate is associated with a 1%
reduction in private investment.

In this regard, ﬁgure 1 shows the ratio of taxation/GDP vis-a-vis investment/GDP, in the
1947-2009 period, according to data from IPEADATA (2014). Corroborating these authors,
its empirically observed that the tax burden over Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio ranged
from 27.9% in 1994 (year marked by economic stabilization promoted by the Plano Real), to
30.4% in 2000 and 33.7% in 2009. During the same period, the investment/GDP ratio registered
decrease, indicating 22.2%, 18.3% and 17.8%, respectively.

Therefore, considering the period in Figure 1, the tax burden has grown considerably, rela-
tive to the Brazilian GDP, from 1963 to 1970, while the investment/GDP ratio, paradoxically,
grew until 1981. Veloso et al.
(2008) associates it, mainly, to the lagged effect associated
with the restructurings of Program of the Government Economic Action (PAEG), in the ad-
ministration of President Castello Branco (1964-1967). However, during the second half of
the 1980s, Brazil experienced a sharp drop in investment, possibly because of internal political
and economic instabilities, conﬁrmed by Luporini and Alves (2010). It is observed from then,

in general, negative relationship between taxes and investment, supporting research by Santos
and Pires (2009). Especially after the 1994 Brazilian economic stabilization, there is a progres-
sive increase in the tax burden, in order to sustain the persistent increase in public spending
in the same period, as discussed by Giambiagi (2006), Pastore and Pinotti (2006) and Veloso
(2006). This behavior may have inhibited investment, which remained on a downward trend,
with change of trajectory only in 2003-2008 as a result of public interventions. Finally, in 2009,
in response to the international economic crisis, the Brazilian tax burden recedes in proportion
to GDP, however, with investment accompanying such movement.

Thus, the purpose of this article is to analyze how the tax component, mainly taxes over
proﬁt and revenue of ﬁrms, can affect investment decision, productivity, growth and well being
of the Brazilian economy. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the model and
the calibration strategy, section 3 shows the quantitative results with different government labor
market policies. Section 4 provides concluding remarks.

2 Model

In this section, we use the neoclassical growth model to analyze different ﬁscal policies. We add
technological shocks to total factor productivity: A = A(s) where s follows a Markov Chain
with transition matrix P. Therefore, in equilibrium, prices will depend on the aggregate state
variables: (K, s).

Preferences

There are a measure one of identical inﬁnitely lived agents. Their instantaneous utility
function is deﬁned over consumption and leisure. Agents own ﬁrms and receive dividends.

They also can trade one-period bonds. Government taxes families on consumption, savings and
labor income. The representative agent faces the following problem:

subject to

v(b, z, K, s) = max(c,l,z(cid:48),b(cid:48)){u(c, 1 − l) + βE[v(b(cid:48), z(cid:48), K(cid:48), s(cid:48))/s]}

(1 + τ c)c(K, s) + P z(K, s)z(cid:48) + b(cid:48) = W + (1 − τ l)w(K, s)l + T

c ≥ 0; 1 ≤ z(cid:48) ≥ 0; 1 ≤ l ≥ 0;

(2)
(3)

where:
W (cid:48) = (1+r(K, s)(1−τ b(cid:48)

with

))b(cid:48)+(P z(K(cid:48), s(cid:48))+dz(K(cid:48), s(cid:48)))z(cid:48)−[(1−τ z(cid:48)

)(P z(K(cid:48), s(cid:48))−P z(K, s))]+z(cid:48)
(4)

[(1 − τ z(cid:48)

)(P z(K(cid:48), s(cid:48)) − P z(K, s))]+ = max{(1 − τ z(cid:48)

)(P z(K(cid:48), s(cid:48)) − P z(K, s)), 0}

(5)

Note that there are two types of taxation on household savings. The ﬁrst one is the taxation
on the net return of one-period bonds (τ b) and the second one is the taxation on capital gain
from stocks (τ z). Equation (5) shows that capital gain taxation is strictly positive only when
selling price is higher than purchased price.

Technology

Firms face taxation on dividends and production. They own capital and make investment’s
decision. For simplicity, we assume that depreciation rate equals 100%. Investment is subject
to an adjustment cost that is assumed to be a quadratic function: J(I).

V (K, s) = max{d,L,I,K(cid:48)}{(1 − τ d)d +

2.1 Recursive Competitive Equilibrium

A stationary recursive competitive equilibrium is a set of price functions: {r(K, s), P z(K, s),
w(K, s)}; household’s allocation functions: {c(b, z, K, s), l(b, z, K, s), b(cid:48)(b, z, K, s), z(cid:48)(b, z, K, s)}
; ﬁrm’s allocation functions: {d(K, s), L(K, s), I(K, s), K(cid:48)(K, s)}, government ﬁscal policies:
{g, T , τ c, τ l, τ b, τ z, τ d, τ y} and value functions: v(b, z, K, s) and V (K, s) such that:

4

i. v(b, z, K, s) satisﬁes household’s Bellman equation (1) and c(b, z, K, s), l(b, z, K, s),

b(cid:48)(b, z, K, s) and z(cid:48)(b, z, K, s) are the associated policy functions.

ii. V (K, s) satisﬁes Bellman equation (6) and d(K, s), L(K, s), I(K, s) and K(cid:48)(K, s) are

the associated policy functions.

iii. Government ﬁscal policies satisﬁes (9)

iv. Markets clear:

c + g + I = A(s)F (K, L) − J(I)
l = L
b = 0
z = 1

(11)
(12)
(13)

v. Law of motion for aggregate states (K, s) is induced by the Markov chain and the optimal

policy for aggregate capital, K(cid:48) = g(K, s).

Market clearing conditions (10) shows that aggregate demand equals the net production
function out of adjustment costs. Appendix (A) shows the partial equilibrium analysis for rep-
resentative household and appendix (B) shows the decision for the representative ﬁrm.

2.2 Calibration Strategy and Benchmark Economy

In order to study the competitive equilibrium, the model is calibrated to replicate the Brazilian
economy in the deterministic long-run economy and a set of experiments is conducted. We
feed the model with changes in the government parameters to study how much of the change in
investment and production can be accounted for changes in ﬁscal policy. The algorithm for the
numerical solution consists of linearizing all the equations that characterizes the equilibrium
using ﬁrst order Taylor approximation around the deterministic steady state.

The instantaneous utility function used is the additive separable logarithm utility function,
therefore, there are just two parameters to calibrate for preferences: β and a 1. β was calibrated
to match Brazilian annual real interest rate of 43.4% 2. The other parameter, a, was calibrated
to match the time Brazilian workers allocate to labor market activities 3.

The production function is assumed to be a Cobb-Douglas, hence, there are four parameters
to calibrate for technology: the capital share, θ; the parameter for the adjustment cost function,
AI, where J(I) = AII 2 and two parameters for the technology shock, the persistence parame-
ter, ρ and the variance, σ2. The capital share and the technology shock parameters were taken
from Gomes et al. (2005)4. Finally, AI was calibrated to match Brazilian capital output ratio of
1.75 ( Gomes et al. (2005)).

Table 1 shows the last seven remaining parameters to be calibrated regarding to government
policies. They were calibrated to match the historical series of public ﬁnance: government
expenditures, revenue from taxes on consumption, revenue from labor income taxes, revenue

3 Quantitative Results

Adjustment Cost

Figures 2 and 3 show the impulse responses from technological shock in the model without
adjustment cost and the model with adjustment cost. The main difference is the speed of ad-
justment and persistence of the shock. With adjustment cost, the adjustments of investment and
capital level are smoother. On the other hand, the adjustments of marginal value of capital (To-
bin’s q) and the interest rate (RLT) in ﬁgures 2a and 3a are faster in the model with adjustment
cost to investment. Note that a positive technological shock increases the value of the ﬁrm in
the short run. Since Tobin’s q has increased, investment (and capital level) increases.

Fiscal Policies Implications

With the parameters calibrated, we ﬁrst analyze the long-run implications of changes in
ﬁscal policy. Because of the nature of government spending, g, an increase in g, ceteris paribus,
will only decrease private consumption and have no effect on investment and production. That
occurs because, using the government balanced budget (equation 9), an increase in government
expenditures increases the lump-sum tax in the same amount implying no distortions in relative
prices 5. Table 2 shows the main long-run results when we increase in 10% and 20% government
taxation on ﬁrm’s production with respect to the benchmark parameters.

Table 3: Long-Run results for changes in taxation on bonds

Interestingly, the most important tax with respect to capital accumulation is the taxation on
private bonds. This comes from the fact that this tax changes the real interest rate in equilibrium
and therefore, impacts on consumption decision and, most important, in the present value of
dividends, decreasing ﬁrm’s value. Table 3 shows that an increase of 10% in the tax on bonds,
τb, decreases capital level in approximately 6% of GDP, which is almost the double of the effect
of taxation on sales.

4 Concluding Remarks

This paper shows that changes in ﬁscal policy, mainly, taxes on ﬁrm’s sales and in the return of
private bonds have important effects on capital and GDP level. Most important, we showed that,
in equilibrium, the strongest effect arises from taxation on private bonds. This happens because
an increase in taxes on bond’s return changes the real interest rate in the long-run equilibrium,
decreasing the value of the ﬁrm and, therefore, investment decision in the path towards the new

steady state. In the long run, the economy presents a lower level of capital, lower productivity
and lower capital output ratio.

This ﬁrst draft of the paper just considered the long-run implications of different taxations,
therefore, taxes on dividends and capital gains have no effect (see appendix B). Therefore, a
natural extension of this paper is to consider short-run effects of government policy shocks.
Finally, other possible extension for our model is to consider public investment and govern-
ment wages in the model in order to analyze how government spending might affect private
investment, proﬁt and production.

A Household’s Problem

Let λ be the Lagrangean multiplier. Therefore, the ﬁrst order conditions for the representative
household problem are:

(14)

(17)

Applying Benveniste and Scheinkman formula to equations (16) and (17) and using equation

(14) to substitute for λ:

u2(c, 1 − l)

=

[(P z(s(cid:48)) + dz(s(cid:48))) − (1 − τ z(cid:48)

)(P z(s(cid:48)) − P z(s))+]/s]

(20)

Rearranging equations (19) and (20):

u1(c(cid:48), 1 − l(cid:48))
u1(c, 1 − l)

(1 + τ c)
(1 + τ c(cid:48)

Equation (18) shows that, in the optimum, the ratio of the marginal utilities equals the ratio
of the cost between consumption and leisure. Equations (21) and (22) show the well-known
general asset pricing formula. For any security, the expected return adjusted by the stochastic
discount factor equals one.

B Firm’s Problem

The problem of a representative ﬁrm is:

V (K, s) = max{L,I,K(cid:48)}{(1−τ d)((1−τ y)A(s)F (K, L)−w(K, s)L−I−J(I))+

1

1 + r(s)

subject to:

K(cid:48) = I

Let q be the Lagrangean multiplier. Therefore, the ﬁrst order conditions are:

= 0 → (1 − τ d)(1 − τ y)A(s)FL(K, L) = w(K, s)

∂V
∂L

∂V

∂K(cid:48) = 0 → 1

∂V
∂I

E[V (K(cid:48), s(cid:48))/s]}

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

Note that equation (27) is the famous Tobin’s q theory. It shows that ﬁrm invests to the
point where the market value of capital (q) equals its replacement cost. Using Benveniste and
Scheinkman formula in equation (26) and substituting for q using equation (27):

1

1 + r(s)

E[(1 − τ d(cid:48)

)(1 − τ y(cid:48)

)A(s(cid:48))FK(K(cid:48), L(cid:48))/s] = (1 − τ d)[1 + J(cid:48)(I)]

With full depreciation and constant taxation, equation (28) can be written as:

1

1 + r(s)

E[(1 − τ y)A(s(cid:48))FK(K(cid:48), L(cid:48))/s] = [1 + J(cid:48)(I)]

(28)

(29)

Equation (29) shows that the only tax that matters for ﬁrms investment decision is the tax

on production as long as the taxation on dividends is constant over time.
