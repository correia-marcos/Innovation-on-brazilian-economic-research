Abstract

The objective of this paper is to investigate the relationship among
size of the government, composition of public spending, and economic
growth. We expand the theoretical model due to Devarajan et al (1996)
by including technological progress in a more general constant elastic-
ity of substitution (CES) production function. In addition, we use a
balanced panel data for the Brazilian states to estimate the model’s
structural parameters and compute optimal ratios derived from the
theoretical modeling. We found that private capital and government
spending are substitute inputs in the production, while productive and
unproductive expenditures are combined in a ﬁxed ratio in the aggre-
gate government spending. The public spending in investment is con-
siderable lower than in costing, as occurs in developing countries with
low economic dynamism. Finally, the estimated average tax burden
is below the optimal level implied by the model, meaning that there
is space for increasing taxation without hurting economic growth for
some Brazilian states.

Introduction

Several countries around the world have recently faced episodes of ﬁscal
crises due to the incapacity of their governments to bridge a deﬁcit between
public expenditures and tax revenues.1 These crises share some common
features, given that they are usually accompanied by economic, social, and
political distresses and the recovery is painful to the society as hole because
it simultaneously requires to cut government spending and to increase tax
on individuals and ﬁrms. Due to the relevance of the ﬁscal policy to a
country’s economic performance, it is important to keep an eye on both the
relationship between the size of government and economic growth and the
eﬀects of the composition of the public expenditure on the country’s growth
rate. The latter issue rests on the fact that some public expenditures are
seen as productive while others are considered unproductive in terms of their
impacts on the economic activity. Thus, under this perspective, a country
would be able to improve its economic performance by changing the mix
between these two kinds of public expenditures.

1The cases of Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, and more recently Brazil, for instance,

are well documented by the general media.

The empirical and theoretical literatures have devoted a considerable
amount of work to analyze the relationship among the size of the govern-
ment, composition of the public expenditure, and economic growth. As-
chauer (1989), Lindauer and Velenchik (1992), and Barro (1990, 1991), for
instance, investigated the impacts of aggregate government spending on eco-
nomic growth and productivity. In a pioneer study, Devarajan et al (1996)
analyzed the relationship between composition of public expenditure and
economic growth using both theoretical and empirical frameworks. Davoodi
and Zou (1998), Xie et al (1999), and Zhang and Zou (1998) examined the
growth eﬀects of aggregate public expenditure by diﬀerent levels of gov-
ernment in a ﬁscal-federalism environment. Finally, Zhang and Zou (2001)
uniﬁed the previous literature by focusing on the growth impacts of the
allocation of public expenditure among multiple sectors (such as health, ed-
ucation, transportation, among others) with multiple levels of government
(such as local, state, and federal). It is still missing in the literature, how-
ever, studies on the optimal size of the government and on the optimal
composition of the public expenditure.

For the Brazilian case, Rocha and Giuberti (2007) and Divino and Silva
Jr. (2012) provide empirical evidence on the optimal composition of the
public expenditure for states and municipal districts, respectively. Both
authors do not impose any a priori restriction on the productivity of the
public expenditure and ﬁnd that the optimal share of the current spending
should range from 61 to 81% of the total public spending. However, no
attempt was made to model the relationship among optimal size of the
government, composition of the public spending and economic growth.

The objective of this paper is to ﬁll this gap by investigating both the-
oretical and empirically the relationship among optimal size of the govern-
ment in the economy, optimal shares of productive and unproductive public
expenditures in the aggregate government spending, and economic growth.
We extend the framework proposed by Devarajan et al (1996) by including
an exogenous technological progress in a more general constant elasticity
of substitution (CES) production function and we show how those optimal
shares and government size depend on the structural parameters of the econ-
omy. We focus on economic growth instead of other measure of welfare for
comparison purposes with the results by Devarajan et al (1996) and because
it is important to identify the contribution of diﬀerent components of the
public expenditure to the economic growth.

Our major contribution is to show that the optimal size of the govern-
ment in the economy, deﬁned as the level of aggregate public expenditure
over GDP that maximizes consumption growth, depends on the model’s

3

structural parameters.
In addition, we ﬁnd that the growth rate of con-
sumption is inversely related with both the individuals’ degree of impatience
and the aggregate tax rate. For the Brazilian states, the average optimal
size is around 20% under a general speciﬁcation of the model. Considering
the special case of a Cobb-Douglas production function, that optimal size
negatively depends on the share of the capital in the production function.

The optimal share of productive public expenditure relatively to the un-
productive spending, on its turn, depends on the share of the productive
spending and the elasticity of substitution between productive and unpro-
ductive public spending in the CES production function of the government.
Considering the case of a Cobb-Douglas, that optimal share depends ex-
clusively on the share of the productive expenditure on the aggregate gov-
ernment spending. Thus, it is crucial to have good estimates for these
parameters in order to calculate optimal ratios for any given country.

In the general case, however, the optimal taxation depends on the whole
set of structural parameters. In particular, the technological progress has a
direct eﬀect on the optimal level of taxation while the share of private capital
in total production has a negative eﬀect on taxation. This theoretical ﬁnding
coincides with the empirical results obtained for the Brazilian economy.

In order to estimate the structural parameters and ﬁnd optimal ratios,
we applied the model to a panel data for the Brazilian states in the re-
cent period. A general CES production function, which combines private
capital, composition of public expenditure, and technological progress, was
estimated at the state level. We found that private capital and government
spending are substitute inputs in the production, while government expen-
ditures in investment and costing are combined in a ﬁxed ratio due to the
rigidity of the public budget imposed by legal aspects. We computed the
composition of public spending, level of taxation, and economic growth im-
plied by the estimated structural parameters for the Brazilian states. Then,
we calculated the level of taxation and composition of the public expendi-
ture that maximize the economic growth. We also performed a sensitivity
analysis of the private capital productivity and average economic growth
with respect to changes in the composition of public expenditure and tax
rate.

The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the model
economy and derives the theoretical results. The empirical evidence for the
Brazilian economy is reported and discussed in the third section. Finally,
the fourth section is dedicated to the concluding remarks.

2 The model

The theoretical framework is based on Devarajan et al (1996), whose
model is extended to consider a general CES (constant elasticity of sub-
stitution) function for both the government aggregate expenditure and the
economy total production under a minimal set of restrictions on the parame-
ter values. In addition, we add technological progress to the aggregate CES
production function. Thus, diﬀerently from the original model, our pro-
duction function depends on private capital stock, k, aggregate government
government spending, x, and exogenous technological progress, A.2 They
are combined into a CES function expressed as:

yt = At

−ζ
t + (1 − α)x

αk

−ζ
t

with 1 ≥ α > 0, ζ ∈ (−1, 0) ∪ (0, +∞).

The aggregate government spending, x, is also given by a CES function
which combines productive, g1, and unproductive, g2, expenditures. The
government ﬁnances its spending by levying a ﬂat-rate income tax, τ . The
following equations represent these relationships:

where 1 ≥ α1 ≥ 0, ζ1 ∈ (−1, 0) ∪ (0, +∞), 0 < τ < 1.

The private capital stock, k, follows a standard law of motion:

τ yt = g1t + g2t

˙kt = (1 − τ )yt − ct

The representative agent chooses consumption, c, and capital, k, to max-
imize the expected discounted value of utility, which has the isoelastic form
of a CRRA (constant relative risk aversion) function:

2.1 Theoretical Results

The solution of problem (P) under the previous parametrization, and in
the special case of a Cobb-Douglas production function, allows us to derive
our major ﬁndings. They are reported in the following sequence of Lemmas
and Theorems.
Lemma 1. There exists φ : [0, +∞) → [0, 1] such that g1t = φtτ yt and
g2t = (1 − φt)τ yt ∀t ∈ [0, +∞).
Proof. Follows from the fact that τ yt = g1t + g2t ∀t ∈ [0, +∞).

by the output of the economy. A special case emerges when ζ1 → 0,
which implies that δ = 1, xt = τ yt, and xt = g1t + g2t. The third
equation follows from the previous Lema.

Thus, each unit of private capital generates 1

The third equation follows from the substitution of xt. Notice that

Notice that all quantities are positive. The last inequality follows because

This means that this model collapses to a traditional Ak growth model.
In the special case of a Cobb-Douglas production function, where ζ = 0 and
ζ1 = 0, we have that both δt = 1 and θt = 1. From now on, we no longer
assume that At = 1.
Theorem 3. If Im(φ) ⊂ (0, 1) and c : [0, +∞) → (0, +∞) is a continuously
diﬀerentiable function, then the the growth rate of consumption is:

Theorem 3 states that the growth rate of consumption in this economy
might be positive or negative, depending on 1−τ
ρ and θt according to Corol-
laries 1 and 2.
In order to keep a positive growth rate of consumption,
λt > 0, the economy should be characterized by low degree of impatience
and low tax rate, such that 1−τ
ρ > θt. In this environment, the representative
agent would be willing to transfer consumption across time and the after-
tax income would be suﬃcient to allow for this transference. In the special
case of a Cobb-Douglas, we have that λt > 0 only if τ + ρ < 1, given that
λt = (1−τ−ρ)
in this case. Next, in Lemma 2, we deﬁne the optimal share
for productive (and unproductive) government spending also as a function
of the economy structural parameters.

We point that if φ ∈ (0, φ∗), then ∂θ
∂φ > 0. Thus, the statement follows.
Essentially, the optimal share of the productive public expenditure, φ∗,
depends on α1 and ζ1. In the special case of a Cobb-Douglas production
function, this optimal share simpliﬁes to φ∗ = α1. This result is intuitive
because the higher is the elasticity of the productive expenditure in the
aggregate public spending, xt, the higher will be the optimal share of the
productive expenditure.

Theorem 4. The maximizer of the growth rate consumption is the mini-
mizer of θ as a function of φ.

Proof. Since the growth rate consumption is

σθt

λt =

(13)

The statement follows because the maximum value of λ is achieved at the
same φ∗ that θ achieves its minimum value with respect to φ.

Next, we try to ﬁnd the optimal τ , which is compatible with the maxi-
mum growth rate of consumption. Notice that, by problem (P ), this optimal
τ also corresponds to the optimal size of the government expenditure in the
economy.

The statement follows, because for each τ < τ∗ the function λ increases.
Analogously, for each τ > τ∗ the function λ decreases. In the special case
where ζ ∈ (−1, 0), a positive variation of At leads to an increase in τ∗. This
suggests that a higher technological progress allows for a higher level of
optimal taxation, provided that all other variables are kept unchanged.

3 Empirical Evidence

3.1 Econometric Model

We estimate, by nonlinear least squares, the aggregate CES function
which emerges from the combination of the previous equations (1) and (2).
In a panel data environment, considering the data set that will be used in
the estimation, it might be written as:

(cid:20)

−ζ
jt + (1 − α)

αk

(1 − η1)g

−ζ1
1jt + η1g

−ζ1
2jt

+ εjt

(18)

This equation is equivalent to the one that comes from the theoretical
model, but making (1−η1) = α1 as the share public spending in investment.

11

The structural parameter α deﬁnes the share of private capital in the output
while (1 − α) represents the share of the aggregate government spending in
the output. In addition, η1 is the share of current spending and (1 − η1) is
the share of public investment in the aggregate government spending3. The
parameters ζ and ζ1 generate elasticities4 and ε is an additive random error.
The heterogeneous technological progress in each state is Ajt. Following

Duﬀy and Papageorgiou (2000), it is modeled by:

Ajt = exp(γpi + νt)

(19)

We use the cumulative distribution of patents across the Brazilian states
to create a dummy variable for the i% group of the least productive ones in
terms of number of registered patents. These states are considered as having
low degree of technological progress. They will have an output smaller than
the average whenever γ < 0.5 Given that the technological progress might
change over time, ν accounts for the estimation of this time eﬀect.

Finally, we considered variables in both levels and per capita terms.

Thus, we estimate four regression models, as described below:

1. Model (A): Without technological progress, such that Ajt = 1 for all

states;

2. Model (B): With technological progress, such that i = 5% of the Brazil-

ian states that least registered patents;

3. Model (C): Similar to the model (A), but with per capita variables;

4. Model (D): Similar to the model (B), but with per capita variables.

3.2 Data

We use a balanced panel composed by the 27 Brazilian states in the
period from 2004 to 2010 with annual data, totalizing 189 observations for
each variable.6 The nominal variables were deﬂated by the wide consumer
3(1 − η1) is the share of public investment because g1 does not include expenses with

interest rate and debt rollover.

4Because it is a CES, the constant elasticities are given by ψ = 1
5We considered i = 1% and i = 5% in the estimation, but the results were similar.
We also used other variables, such as number of patents, average of registered patents
and average of registered patents in the last 5 years. However, we had converge problems.
Thus, we chose to work with i = 5%.

1+ζ and ψ1 = 1

The variables are describe in sequence.

y: Gross domestic product (GDP) of the Brazilian states released by

Ipeadata7.

g1: Government spending in investment by each Brazilian state, which
consists of total capital spending minus payment of interest rate and debit
amortization. The source also is Ipeadata.

g2: Government spending on costing (or current spending) by each

Brazilian state, also collected from the Ipeadata.

k: Stock of private capital of each Brazilian state, computed according

to the procedure proposed by Sanches and Rocha (2010).

The technological progress of each Brazilian state was measured by the
amount of registered patents provided by the National Institute of Intel-
lectual Property (Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial - INPI). We
create a dummy variable, p5, to represent the 5% of the Brazilian states that
least registered patents in each time period. Thus, p5 = 1 when state j is
part of these 5% that least registered patents according to the cumulative
distribution of patents and p5 = 0 otherwise.

3.3 Empirical Results

Initially, we tested the panel data for the presence of unit root. We
applied tests due to Levin-Lin-Chu (LLC), Im-Pesaran-Shin (IPS), Fisher-
ADF, Hadri, and Pedroni (1999). The results indicated that the panel is
stationary at the 5% signiﬁcance level. The non-linear estimation of equation
(18) was then carried out with all variables in levels. Initial values of the
parameters were set at 0.0001 in order to allow for convergence to either
positive or negative values.

Due to individual heterogeneity of the Brazilian states, which might
lead to heteroscedasticity in the residuals, we performed a correction in the
variance-covariance matrix for robust standard errors in clusters. However,
for the results reported in Table 1, the coeﬃcients that were statically signiﬁ-
cant at the 1% signiﬁcance level maintained this signiﬁcance with or without
that correction.

The parameter ν in equation (19), which represents the deterministic
component of the technological progress, was not statistically signiﬁcant in

any estimation. This might be due to short time horizon of the sample.
Thus, the time eﬀect was excluded from the estimations and only estimated
values for γ are reported in Table 1. As mentioned before, the ﬁrst two es-
timated models refer to variables in levels while the last two use per capita
variables. In addition, models A and C assume no technological progress
across the Brazilian states (Ajt = 1), while models B and D estimates tech-
nological progress according to equation (19) with ν = 0.

The share of private capital in the total output, α, was estimated above
65% in all models, indicating that private capital is more important than
the government’s compound spending for the aggregate production of the
Brazilian states. This high estimated value might also capture the eﬀect of
labor in the output, which is not explicitly modeled in the production func-
tion (1) based in Devarajan et al (1996). The negative estimated value for ζ
points out that private investment and government spending are substitute
inputs in the production. This suggest that the ratio of these inputs uti-
lization in the production changes more than proportionately to any change
in the ratio of their marginal products, but we are not able to identify in
which direction ﬂows these changes.8

Considering the composition of the government spending, η1 is always

above 85% meaning that the government spends a larger fraction of the
public budget on current spending (g2) than in public investment (g1). This
ﬁnding is in line with the fact that public investment is still a small fraction
of public spending in the Brazilian economy. The coeﬃcient ζ1 was not sta-
tistically diﬀerent from zero at the 5% signiﬁcance level, suggesting that the
public spending composition, xt, might be represented by a Cobb-Douglas
function, which is a special case of the general CES assumed in equation (2).
This means that g1 and g2 are combined in a ﬁxed ratio in the aggregate
government spending, independently of the ratio of their marginal products.
This results reﬂects the rigidity of the public budget of the Brazilian states,
where the shares of several expenditures are ﬁxed by law.

The Brazilian states classiﬁed as having lower technological progress ac-
cording to the amount of registered patents presented a negative and statis-
tically signiﬁcant value for γ. This means that they have a smaller output
than the other states, which are in the group that registered more than 5%
of the patents in each time period. Thus, the states contained in p5 are
expected to have an output which is, on average, about 49 and 47% smaller
than the states that are outside p5 according to models (B) and (D), respec-
tively.9 This ﬁnding is in line with the literature, according to which the
less technologically developed economies are also the ones with lower levels
of production.

To ﬁnd the growth rate of consumption λ and the other compound pa-
rameters implied by the theoretical model, we need to set values for the risk
aversion coeﬃcient σ and the intertemporal discount factor, ρ, in addition
to use the estimated coeﬃcients from Table 1. Notice that the preference
of the government for investment spending is α1 = (1 − η1). The values
for σ = 4.89 and ρ = 0.123 were obtained from from Issler and Piqueira
(2000).10 Using these values, we can ﬁnd the average growth rate of con-
sumption, λ, the ratio of private capital to output, θ, and the deviations
from the predicted λ to the observed growth rate from the data, as reported
in Table 2.

The inverse of θ measures the productivity of the private capital in the
economy. Thus, the lower θ the more productive is the private capital. Table
2 indicates that this productivity ranges from 0.52 to 0.29, depending on the

for the states that belong to p5 in models B and D, respectively, according to Table 1.

10Issler and Piqueira (2000) reported the intertemporal discount rate as β = 0.89. To
ﬁnd the intertemporal discount factor, ρ, we use β = 1
1+ρ , which yielded ρ = 0.123. Other
authors, such as Catalo and Yoshino (2006), Costa and Carrasco (2015), and Faria and
Ornelas (2015) have found similar values for σ and ρ.

estimated model.

Comparing the estimated models with and without technological progress,
model (A) yields the smallest mean-squared deviation from λ with respect
to the observed consumption growth rate from the data. Except for model
(C), the values of the estimated parameters are similar across the alterna-
tive models. This meas that the estimated structural parameters are quite
stable across the models.
The optimal fraction of investment spending, φ∗, and optimal tax rate,
τ∗, that maximize consumption growth, λ, are reported in Table 3. The
short time horizon of the sample might have biased the impact of the gov-
ernment spending in investment over the economic growth of the Brazilian
states, as measured by φ∗.11 Given that the average total tax revenue is
around 16% of the GDP for the Brazilian states, according to the data for
the 2004 to 2010 period available from the Ipeadata, one might argue that
τ < τ∗ and some states have average taxation below the optimum level.

Because ζ1 is not statistically diﬀerent from zero, we have that φ∗ = α1.
In this case, only with the optimal levels of investment spending, φ∗, and
tax rate, τ∗, it is not possible to access how the consumption growth rate
depends on these parameters. To do so, we need to compute the partial
derivatives reported in Tables 4 and 5.

11Divino and Silva Jr. (2012) found that the optimal share of public spending in cap-
ital is 32% for high-income, 23% for middle-income, and 19% for low-income Brazilian
municipal districts.

∂θ/∂φ
∂θ/∂τ

The ratio of public spending in investment, φ, according to Lemma 2
is above the optimal level because ∂θ/∂φ > 0. This result implies that an
increase in φ leads to a decrease in the productivity of the private capital
and so to a decrease in in the growth rate of consumption, λ. According to
Theorem 4, the maximization of λ as a function of φ occurs when θ is at
the minimum. This might also mean that public spending in costing, g2, is
below the optimal level.

An increase in the tax rate, τ , decreases the private capital relatively to
the output of the economy. This is a classic result given that an increase in
taxation will reduce the amount of private capital available in the economy.
However, the eﬀect of a higher τ on λ is not obvious because the productivity
of the private capital increases.

In fact, as shown in Table 5, ∂λ/∂τ > 0 for the Brazilian states. The
eﬀective taxation is below the optimal level, suggesting that there is space
for a tax increase without harming economic growth of the economy.

Another result from Table 5 is the positive eﬀect of changes in tech-
nological progress to the consumption growth. This is expected once an
increase in technology has a direct eﬀect on output, which leads to a rise
in consumption. This eﬀect is very similar across the alternative models, as
illustrated in Table 5.

4 Concluding Remarks

The objective of this paper was to investigate both theoretical and em-
pirically the relationship among optimal size of the government in the econ-
omy, optimal shares of productive and unproductive public expenditures in

17

the aggregate government spending, and economic growth. We expanded
the model by Devarajan et al (1996) to include exogenous technological
progress in a more general constant elasticity of substitution (CES) produc-
tion function. We showed how those optimal shares depend on the structural
parameters of the economy and provided empirical evidence by using a bal-
anced panel data for the Brazilian states in the recent period.

The Cobb-Douglas and Ak production functions are obtained as special
cases of the general CES speciﬁcation. In the special case of Cobb-Douglas
production function, economic growth requires that the sum of tax rate and
intertemporal discount factor in the utility be strictly smaller than one. In
addition, the optimal public spending that maximizes consumption growth
is given by the fraction of public spending allocated on capital.

In the general case, the growth rate of consumption is inversely related
with both the individuals’ degree of impatience and the tax rate.The opti-
mal taxation, deﬁned as the one that maximizes the consumption growth,
depends on the whole set of structural parameters. In particular, the tech-
nological progress has a direct eﬀect on the optimal level of taxation while
the share of private capital in the output has a negative eﬀect on the opti-
mal taxation. This theoretical ﬁnding coincided with the empirical results
obtained for the Brazilian economy.

The estimated parameters for the Brazilian states suggest that, on av-
erage, the share of private capital in the total production is 0.66 while the
share of total government spending is 0.34. The estimated elasticity of sub-
stitution between these two inputs ranged from 1.40 to 1.45, depending on
the model speciﬁcation. Thus, private capital and government spending are
substitute inputs in the production and the latter has a signiﬁcant share in
the output of the Brazilian states.

Devarajan et al. (1996) argue that developing countries, due to the low
economic dynamism, require a signiﬁcant fraction of government spending
allocated to costing. This ﬁnding was observed for the Brazilian economy,
were about 85% of the total public spending was in costing and only 15% was
in public investment. This result is in line with the widely spread consensus
that public investment is still a small fraction of public spending in the
Brazilian economy.

Taking as a whole, the government spending is below the optimal level.
Thus, it is possible to increase the growth rate of consumption by rising the
government spending under a balanced public budget. The estimated opti-
mal taxation by the model that best ﬁtted the data was 19.5%, while the
average taxation observed from the data for the Brazilian states is around
16%. Thus, there is space for increasing taxation, and so for rising govern-

18

ment spending, without hurting the economic growth.

For future research, it would be interesting to include public debt in the
government budget constraint along with its dynamics in an intertemporal
framework. It would be also interesting to expand the empirical analysis to
a panel of countries with data for the pre and post international ﬁnancial
crisis. Some of these suggestions are object of our current research.
