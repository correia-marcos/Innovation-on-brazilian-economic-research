What Can We Learn from the Greek Crisis?1

ABSTRACT: We develop a multiregional general equilibrium model for Greece to simulate the short 
run impacts of temporary deficit-financed rises in government spending. It has been recognized that 
the fiscal multiplier is a function of structural features of the economy and policy reaction parameters. 
Moreover, the debate on the magnitude of the multiplier along the business cycle has also been the 
subject of disputed debates. On these grounds, we look at the Greek case by calibrating the model 
using  data  for  distinct  states  of  the  Greek  economy  during  the  development  of  the  recent  crisis. 
Whether this matters for local and nationwide multipliers depends on qualitative differences of the 
numerical structures of the model. Our results imply that structural coefficients have a strong effect 
on  government  spending  impact  multipliers.  In  the  case  of  Greece,  lack  of  information  on  the 
changing  magnitudes  of  behavioral  parameters  over  time  adds  another  layer  of  uncertainty  to  this 
debate.

RESUMO: Este artigo tem como objetivo desenvolver um modelo multirregional de equilíbrio geral 
para  a  Grécia  para  simular  os  impactos  de  curto  prazo  dos  aumentos  temporários  dos  gastos  do 
governo.  O  multiplicador  fiscal  é  reconhecido  como  função  das  características  estruturais  da 
economia  e  dos  parâmetros  de  reação  política.  Além  disso,  o  debate  sobre  a  magnitude  do 
multiplicador  também  tem  sido  objeto  de  debate.  Portanto,  este  trabalho  analisa  o  caso  grego  ao 
calibrar  o  modelo  multirregional  de  equilíbrio  geral  usando  dados  regionais  da  economia  grega 
durante  a  recente  crise.  Se  isso  importa  para  os  multiplicadores  locais  e  nacionais  depende  de 
diferenças  qualitativas  das  estruturas  numéricas  do  modelo.  Os  resultados  mostram  que  os 
coeficientes estruturais têm forte efeito sobre os multiplicadores de impacto dos gastos do governo. 
No  caso  da  Grécia,  a  falta  de  informação  sobre  a  mudança  das  magnitudes  dos  parâmetros 
comportamentais ao longo do tempo acrescenta outra camada de incerteza a esse debate.

1. Introduction 
 

The global financial crisis and ensuing recession triggered major fiscal packages throughout the 
world. Many countries implemented fiscal expansion measures in order to stimulate their economies with 
the hope of boosting demand and limiting job losses. In this context, the debate regarding the impact of 
fiscal policy on economic activity regained momentum. Despite the existence of many academic studies 
about the impacts of government spending, the effectiveness of fiscal packages remains a disputed issue. 
In fact, among such various studies, there is consensus on neither the sign nor the size of government 
multipliers (Parker, 2011; Ramey, 2011; Taylor, 2011). 

The magnitude of the multiplier may vary for different reasons, including alternative theoretical 
approaches, methods of calculations and data sources (Chinn, 2013). Contrasting results in the theoretical 
literature  stems  mainly  from  different  analytical  structures4  embedded  in  Neoclassical  and  New 
Keynesian  classes  of  models  (Ramey,  2011;  Nakamura  and  Steinsson,  2014).  The  usual  empirical 
approaches to calculate multipliers – Vector Auto-Regressions (VAR) and Dynamic Stochastic General 
Equilibrium Models (DSGE) –, together with a plethora of reduced-form econometric estimation, rely on 
different  functional  structures,  bringing  additional  uncertainty  to  their  magnitude  (Parker,  2011). 
Moreover,  identifying  strategies  under  limited  availability  of  reliable  instruments  may  cast  doubts  in 
econometric  studies  on  the  required  exogeneity  assumption  on  changes  in  government  fiscal  policy 
(Romer and Romer, 2010; Barro and Redlick, 2011). 

In  addition  to  distinct  analytical  and  functional  structures  underlying  different  theoretical  and 
empirical  approaches,  the  numerical  structure  embedded  in  empirical  studies  is  another  source  of 
uncertainty  for  the  magnitude  of  the  fiscal  multiplier.  As  Chinn  (2013)  observes,  the  multiplier  is  a 
function of structural features of the economy and policy reaction parameters. The information contained 
in the data also reflects the economic context, which is an important element to define the magnitude of 
fiscal multipliers (Ilzetzki et al., 2013; Arin et al., 2015; Hory, 2016).  

Thus, based upon strictly methodological grounds, it is understandable that, even by adopting the 
same  theoretical  model,  the  evidence  extracted  from  different  methods  of  calculations  may  be  quite 
different. Even keeping the same theoretical model and method of investigation, it is also possible that 
different speciﬁcations of the method adopted are able to produce different outcomes (Almeida et al., 
2010). In an extreme case, holding both the analytical and the functional structures constant, numerical 
structures based on different states of the economy may also lead to different results. Hence, interpretation 
of the relationship between government spending and changes in output is unlikely to be independent of 
the choice of the database (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012; Charles, 2016; Haddad et al., 2017).  

A renewed stream of literature relates to the calculation of local fiscal multipliers (Moretti, 2010; 
Acconcia et al., 2014; Chodorow-Reich, 2017).  Local multipliers, or geographic cross-sectional fiscal 
spending multipliers, usually relates the change in regional output to a change in government spending in 
the region.5 Compared to the debate on nationwide multipliers, there is a caveat in the definition of local 
multipliers  that  prevents  reconciliation  between  them.  In  an  integrated  interregional  system  within  a 
country’s  territory,  the  focus  on  intraregional  effects  excludes  interregional  spillovers  of  government 
spending from the calculation. Given the more open nature of subnational regions, there are potentially 
relevant leakages in the spending from a jurisdiction recipient of resources from the central government. 
Thus, as observed by Fishback and Kachanovskaya (2015), reduced-form econometric estimation of local 
multipliers cannot be easily translated into a national multiplier because of spillover effects outside each 
region’s boundaries not captured in those models. Nonetheless, as we will show later on, this limitation 
does not exist in bottom-up multiregional structural models, at least in the short run. 

In this paper, we explore the role of numerical structures in the context of local multipliers derived 
from a multiregional multisectoral structural general equilibrium framework. Given the complexity and 
                                                 
4  “An  empirical  economic  model  (…)  embodies  three  types  of  information:  analytical,  functional  and  numerical.  The 
analytical structure is the background theoretical material which identifies the variables of interest and posits their causal 
relations.  The  functional  structure  is  the  mathematical  representation  of  the  analytical  material,  and  consists  of  the 
algebraic equations which make up the actual model. The numerical structure consists of the signs and magnitudes of the 
coefficients in the equations which form the functional structure.” (McKitrick, 1998, p. 545)

amount of feedback involved in this kind of investigation for which data constraints preclude econometric 
estimation, we rely on the calibration method. The choice of such approach is grounded on its capacity 
for examining policy shocks across regions in the midst of all complexity and feedback effects involved. 
Adopting this perspective, the model, the method of investigation, and its speciﬁcation are chosen and 
will be kept constant, following a strategy suggested in Almeida et al. (2010). We can thus focus on the 
role of the numerical structure by calibrating the model with different datasets for Greece. Moreover, we 
show that the multiregional approach can circumvent the lack of a desirable reconciliation between local 
and nationwide multipliers. 

The  Greek  case  is  particularly  interesting  to  be  examined.  From  2010  to  2013,  period  of  our 
analysis, real GDP fell almost 23% in Greece, with a decrease in government expenditures by 25% and 
in investments by roughly 45%, with a small increase in international exports by less than 2%. In the same 
period, real GRP from the 13 NUTS-2 regions varied from -14.7%, in Western Macedonia to -31.9% in 
Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. In the case of Greece, geography has played an important role since the 
spatial pattern of the initial impacts of the austerity measures was influenced by the geographical presence 
of the public sector. However, when taking into account indirect and induced effects, the regional structure 
of  the  Greek  economy  has  also  influenced  the  spatial  propagation  of  the  impacts  through  a  complex 
diffusion of the multiplier effects (Haddad et al., 2017). Though small, the Greek economy is not internally 
homogenous,  presenting  variations  across  both  industries  and  regions.  Thus,  the  anti-crisis,  austerity, 
measures  taken  in  Greece,  though  horizontal  in  their  nature,  may  have  signiﬁcantly  differentiated 
implications across space (Psycharis et al., 2014). 

The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  In  Section  2  we  narrow  down  the  issues 
addressed  in  the  analysis,  defining  the  empirical  strategy.  Section  3  presents  the  model  used  in  the 
simulations, whose results we present and discuss in Section 4. A final section concludes. 
 
2. Modeling Issues and Empirical Strategy 
 

Addressing the abovementioned issues as the main contributions of this paper – role of numerical 
structure  and  reconciliation of local  and nationwide multipliers  –  would  require  an applied modelling 
approach that took into consideration the structure of interregional linkages within a country driven by 
trade relations (commodity flows), and factor mobility. Information on structural features of distinct states 
of  such  integrated  interregional  national  system  should  also  be  available  for  calibration  of  different 
versions of the model. 

Our choice of the modelling approach highlights the specification of an interdependent system of 
regions within a country in which national-regional feedbacks may occur in both directions. In this so-
called  bottom-up  approach,  analysis  of  policies  originating  at  the  regional  level  is  also  possible.  The 
adding-up property is fully recognized, since national results are obtained from the aggregation of regional 
results (Giesecke and Madden, 2013). 

We  depart  from  a  static  multiregional  and  multisectoral  general  equilibrium  model,  whose 
specification we describe in details in Section 3. Despite some caveats, discussed below, the framework 
embeds  some  of  the  distinct  features  raised  in  the  literature  as  deemed  important  for  understanding 
regional  adjustment mechanisms to government spending shocks.  It includes some of the quantifiable 
forces that make local multipliers differ from national multipliers, namely expenditure switching due to 
domestic  terms  of  trade  effects;  income  effects  affecting  consumption  of  both  locally-produced  and 
external goods; and labor mobility (Chodorow-Reich, 2017). 

Another  reason  for  differences  between  local  and  national  multipliers  is  the  absence  of  the 
possibility of a reaction, at the regional level, by monetary policy. Nonetheless, given the neoclassical 
nature of our model, with flexible relative prices, money is neutral, implying that the specification of 
monetary policy is irrelevant (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014). In this case, assumptions on the sources 
and period of financing, as well as the persistence of government stimuli, gain greater relevance. 

Our  results  will  focus  on  the  short  run  impacts  of  a  temporary  deficit-financed  increase  in 
government spending in the fitted-model Greek economy. We will compute the impact multiplier as the 
change in output that results when government spending is increased by 1 percent of GDP. Due to the 
static  nature  of  the  modelling  framework  adopted  in  this  paper,  we  switch  off  some  of  the  usual 

3 

mechanisms  that  are  present  in  dynamic  settings.  First,  it  is  important  to  distinguish  between  impact 
multipliers  and  the  cumulative  multiplier  (Chinn,  2013).  In  our  context,  we  provide  a  first-order 
approximation of the impact multiplier of government spending on goods and services. Since there is no 
dynamics in the model, the simulations will capture the effects associated with what-if questions in a 
comparative-static framework. Considerations on short run and long run differ in the way the equilibrating 
mechanisms are set through the closures of the model, discussed in Section 3. 

The definition of the closure also deals with identification issues.   Although some critics may 
argue for the charge of incredible identifying assumptions (Sims, 1980), structural models with explicit 
behavioral assumptions for the relevant agents do not face identification problems commonly found in 
econometric  models.  Thus,  our  exogeneity  assumption  on  government  spending  shocks  will  be 
structurally explicit. 

Second, we exempt our analysis from any intertemporal considerations in agents’ behavior. The 
implications for the discussion on fiscal multipliers are at least twofold.  On one hand, we can have a 
narrative approach to justify the short run financing of additional transitory government demand shocks 
by deficit increases. Moreover, if agents ignore the intertemporal aspect of their spending problem, then 
outside-financed and locally deficit-financed multipliers may coincide, as suggested in Chodorow-Reich 
(2017). On the other hand, we do not need to worry about long run reversal of short run changes in relative 
prices in the context of transitory demand shocks in single-currency interregional systems. 

Finally, we will calibrate the model using two different datasets. Our strategy is to use the same 
set of behavioral parameters for both models, and use data from interregional input-output systems for 
two years, 2010 and 2013, to calibrate the structural coefficients. The choice of the years is based on both 
data  availability  and,  mainly,  the  ability  to  represent  distinct  states  of  the  Greek  economy  during  the 
development  of  the  crisis.  As  we  can  see  in  Figure  1,  we  have  selected  two  snapshots  of  the  Greek 
economy related to two points in time that reveal structural features just before the recession took off and 
in its peak, when the unemployment rate reached its highest point.

3. Specification of the Model 
 

 

In this section, we present the analytical, functional and numerical structures of the multiregional 
general equilibrium model for Greece. The specification of the linearized form of the model is provided, 
based on different groups of equations. The notational convention uses uppercase letters to represent the 
levels of the variables and lowercase for their percentage-change representation. Superscripts (u), u = 0, 
1j,  2j,  3,  4,  5,  refer,  respectively,  to  output  (0)  and  to  the  five  different  regional-specific  users  of  the 
products identified in the model6: producers  in  sector  j  (1j), investors in sector  j  (2j), households  (3), 
purchasers of exports (4), and government (5); the second superscript (r) identifies the domestic region 
where the user is located. Inputs are identified by two subscripts: the first (i) takes the values 1, ..., g, for 
commodities, g + 1, for primary factors; the second subscript identifies the source of the input, being it 

                                                 
6  We  have  specified  a  sixth  residual  user,  (6),  to  deal  with  statistical  discrepancies  in  the  balancing  of  the  model’s 
absorption matrix based on the Greek interregional input-output system (IIOS). This procedure deals with the information 
provided in the IIOS on re-exports, and direct purchases abroad by residents and purchases on the domestic territory by 
non-residents, not explicitly introduced in the specification of the CGE model.

from domestic region b (1b) or imported (2), or coming from labor (1) or capital (2), the two primary 
factors in the model. The symbol (•) is employed to indicate a sum over an index. 

We define the following sets: 𝐺 = {1, … , 𝑔}, where g is the number of composite goods; 𝐺∗ =
{1, … , 𝑔, 𝑔 + 1}, where g+1 is the number of composite goods and primary factors, with 𝐺∗ ⊃ 𝐺; 𝐻 =
{1, … , ℎ}, where h is the number of industries; 𝑈 = {(3), (4𝑏), (5), (𝑘𝑗)} for 𝑘 = (1), (2) and 𝑗 ∈ 𝐻, is 
the set of all users in the model; 𝑈∗ = {(3), (5), (𝑘𝑗)} for 𝑘 = (1), (2) and 𝑗 ∈ 𝐻, with 𝑈 ⊃ 𝑈∗, is the 
subset of domestic users; 𝑆 = {1, … , 𝑟, 𝑟 + 1}, where r+1 is the number of all regions (including foreign); 
𝑆∗ = {1, … , 𝑟}, with 𝑆 ⊃ 𝑆∗, is the subset with the r domestic regions; and 𝐹 = {1, … , 𝑓} is the set of 
primary factors. In the ICGE model for Greece, g = h = 44, and r = 13, f = 2.  

We model the sourcing of composite goods based on multilevel structures, which enable a great 
number of substitution possibilities. We employ nested sourcing functions for the creation of composite 
goods, available for consumption in the regions of the model. We assume that domestic users, i.e. firms, 
investors, households, and government, use combinations of composite goods specified within two-level 
CES nests. At the bottom level, bundles of domestically produced goods are formed as combinations of 
goods  from  different  regional  sources.  At  the  top  level,  substitution  is  possible  between  domestically 
produced  and  imported  goods.  Equations  (1)  and  (2)  describe,  respectively,  the  regional  sourcing  of 
domestic goods, and the substitution between domestic and imported products.

source or the foreign source l used by user (u) in region r. 

In addition to goods used as intermediate inputs, firms in the model also demand primary factors 
of  production.  The  equations  that  describe  the  industry  j’s  demands  inputs  are  derived  under  the 
assumption of Leontief technology with Armington nests (imperfect substitution between inputs of the 
same type from different sources).  In our specification of the nested production functions, we assume 
firms to use combinations of composite intermediate inputs, formed according to Equations (1) and (2), 
and primary factor composites. In the case of the primary factor bundle, substitution is possible among 
different types of primary factors. Equation (3) specifies the substitution between labor and capital in the 
model, and is derived under the assumption that industries choose their primary factor inputs to minimize 
costs subject to obtaining sufficient primary factor inputs to satisfy their technical requirements (nested 
Leontief/CES specification).  We  have included technical change variables to allow  for  factor-specific 
productivity  shocks.  We  model  the  combination  of  intermediate  inputs  and  the  value  added  (primary 
factors) aggregate in fixed proportions, at the very top of the nested production function, assuming there 
is no substitution between primary factors and other inputs. The Leontief specification is presented in 
Equation  (4).  More  flexible  functional  forms  have  been  rarely  introduced  in  multi-regional  models, 

5 

mainly due to data availability constraints. In addition to a technical coefficient in the relation between 
the sectoral demand for the primary factor composite and the total output, we have also included a scale 
parameter. This modeling procedure has been based on previous work made by Haddad and Hewings 
(2005)  which  allows  for  the  introduction  of  Marshallian  agglomeration  (external)  economies,  by 
exploring local properties of the CES function.

In deriving the household demands for composite commodities, we assume that households in 
each region behave as a single, budget-constrained, utility-maximizing entity. The utility function is of 
the Stone-Geary or Klein-Rubin form. Equation (6) determines the optimal composition of household 
demand  in  each  region.  Total  regional  household  consumption  is  determined  as  a  function  of  real 
household income. The demands for the commodity bundles in the nesting structure of household demand 
follow the CES pattern established in Equations (1) and (2), in which an activity variable and a price-
substitution term play the major roles. In Equation (6), consumption of each commodity i depends on two 
components:  first,  for  the  subsistence  component,  which  is  defined  as  the  minimum  expenditure 
requirement  for  each  commodity,  changes  in  demand  are  generated  by  changes  in  the  number  of 
households and tastes; second, for the luxury or supernumerary part of the expenditures in each good, 
demand moves with changes in the regional supernumerary expenditures, changes in tastes, and changes 
in  the  price  of  the  composite  commodity.  The  two  components  of  household  expenditures  on  the 
composite commodities are weighted by their respective shares in the total consumption of the composite 
commodity.

In Equation (8), foreign demands (exports) for domestic good i depend on the percentage changes 
in a price, and three shift variables which allow for vertical and horizontal movements in the demand 
curves. The price variable which influences export demands is the purchaser’s price in foreign countries, 
which  includes  the  relevant  taxes  and  margins.  The  parameter  𝜂(𝑖𝑠)
  controls  the  sensitivity  of  export 
demand to price changes.

of constant returns to scale adopted here precludes any activity variable from influencing basic prices, i.e., 
unit costs are independent of the scale at which activities are conducted. Thus, Equation (13) defines the 
percentage change in the price received by producers in regional industry j per unit of output as being 
equal to the percentage change in j’s costs, which are affected by changes in technology and changes in 
input prices.

The theory of the allocation of investment across industries is represented in Equations (15) to 
(18). The comparative-static nature of the model restricts its use to short-run and long-run policy analysis. 
When running the model in the comparative-static mode, there is no fixed relationship between capital 
and investment. The user decides the required relationship on the basis of the requirements of the specific 
simulation. Equation (15) defines the percentage change in the current rate of return on fixed capital in

Equation (17) says that if the percentage change in the rate of return in a regional industry grows 
faster than the national average rate of return, capital stocks in that industry will increase at a higher rate 
than the average national stock. For industries with lower-than-average increase in their rates of return to 
fixed capital, capital stocks increase at a lower-than-average rate, i.e., capital is attracted to higher return

Regional  population  is  defined  through  the  interaction  of  demographic  variables,  including 
interregional  migration.  Links  between  regional  population  and  regional  labor  supply  are  provided. 

9 

Demographic variables are usually defined exogenously, and together with the specification of some of 
the  labor  market  settings,  labor  supply  can  be  determined  together  with  either  interregional  wage 
differentials  or  regional  unemployment  rates.  In  summary,  either  labor  supply  and  wage  differentials 
determine unemployment rates, or labor supply and unemployment rates determine wage differentials. 

Equation (21) defines the percentage-point change in regional unemployment rates in terms of 

percentage changes in labor supply and persons employed.

values for regional labor supply and regional employment, respectively. The variable 𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑢𝑝(𝑟) moves 
with  regional  workforce  participation  rate,  proportional  to  the  regional  population,  and  population  of 
working age. Equation (22) defines regional population changes in the model as ordinary changes in flows 
of  net  regional  migration  (𝑑_𝑟𝑚(𝑟)),  net  foreign  migration  (𝑑_𝑓𝑚(𝑟)),  and  natural  population  growth 
(𝑑_𝑔(𝑟)).

where  𝑔𝑟𝑝𝑟  is  the  percentage  change  in  real  Gross  Regional  Product  in  region  r;  and  the

Calibration 
 

The calibration of the model requires two subsets of data to define its numerical structure so that 
we implement the model empirically. First, we need information from an absorption matrix derived from 
interregional  input-output  sources  (Table  1)  to  calculate  the  coefficients  of  the  model  based  on  the 
following input-output flows: 
 

•  𝐵(𝑖, 1𝑏, (𝑢), 𝑟), with 𝑖 ∈ 𝐺∗, (𝑢) ∈ 𝑈, 𝑏, 𝑟 ∈ 𝑆∗ 
•  𝑇(𝑖, 𝑠, (𝑢), 𝑟), with 𝑖 ∈ 𝐺∗, 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆, 𝐹, (𝑢) ∈ 𝑈, 𝑟 ∈ 𝑆∗ 
•  𝑉(𝑖, 𝑠, (𝑢), 𝑟), with 𝑖 ∈ 𝐺 ∗, 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆, 𝐹, (𝑢) ∈ 𝑈, 𝑟 ∈ 𝑆∗  
•  𝑌(𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑟), with 𝑖 ∈ 𝐺∗, 𝑗 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑟 ∈ 𝑆∗ 

 

We  complete  this  information  with  supplementary  demographic  data  from  EUROSTAT  to 
calibrate the coefficients 𝐿𝐴𝐵𝑆𝑈𝑃(𝑟), 𝐸𝑀𝑃𝐿𝑂𝑌(𝑟) and 𝑃𝑂𝑃(𝑟), with 𝑟 ∈ 𝑆∗. Because these estimates 
are based on snapshot observations for a single year revealing the economic structure of the economic 
system, this subset of data is denoted “structural coefficients” (Haddad et al., 2002).

The second piece of information necessary to calibrate the model is represented by the subset of 
data defining various parameters, mainly elasticities. These are called “behavioral parameters”. Empirical 
estimates for some of the parameters of the model are not available in the literature. We have thus relied 
on “best guesstimates” based on usual values employed in similar models. We set to 1.5 the values for

4. Discussion of Results 
 

Let us first define local and nationwide multipliers in the context of our model specification. We 
compute output (value added) multipliers based on an overall increase in government spending equivalent 
to  1  percent  of  GDP.  We  impose  regional-specific  changes  in  𝑓(5)𝑟,  the  shift  term  for  government 
expenditures in region r, that are proportional to GRP in each region, such that: 
 
∆𝐺𝑂𝑉𝑟 = (0.01)𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟              𝑟 ∈ 𝑆∗  
 
where ∆𝐺𝑂𝑉𝑟 is the ordinary change in government spending in region r, used to compute values for 
𝑓(5)𝑟. 

             (25) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

We  focus  our  analysis  on  the  impacts  of  government  spending  on  changes  in  output.  The 
simulations provide outcomes for percentage changes in 𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟 and 𝐺𝐷𝑃, so that we can compute the 
associated ordinary changes, ∆𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟 and ∆𝐺𝐷𝑃, as follows:  
 
∆𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟 = 𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟𝑔𝑟𝑝𝑟 and   ∆𝐺𝐷𝑃 = ∑ ∆𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟
 

               𝑟 ∈ 𝑆∗

Since the typical simulation involves several different regional shocks, we can divide the total 
change in any endogenous variable between the various shocks. We can thus decompose the changes in 
output according to the contribution of each regional government demand shock. We add a subscript to 
ordinary changes in GRP in each region to include information on the different origins of the exogenous 
change in government spending that may affect that regional output. Equation (27) makes it explicit that 
there are spillovers from local government spending to other regions in the system.

Table 2 presents the results for the nationwide multiplier, based in information for two different 
benchmark years, 2010 and 2013. In addition to the multipliers computed under our general equilibrium 
specification, we have also computed, for the sake of comparison, value added multipliers using the input-
output  model  with  endogenous  households  calibrated  with  the  same  databases.  The  input-output 
framework  provides  our  multiregional  and  multisectoral  system  with  a  demand-driven  mechanical 
approach to calculate multipliers based on an intricate plot of different average propensities to consume 
and to import, with rigid relative prices and no supply constraints.  

Moving  beyond  mechanically  rule-of-thumb  agents  seems  to  influence  the  magnitude  of  the 
multipliers. The accounting-based input-output multipliers are one order of magnitude higher than their 
general equilibrium counterparts. Given the closure of the general equilibrium model, which defines the 
adjustment mechanisms of the economy to the exogenous shock, the imposition of supply constraints play 
an important role to explain such differences.  

Considering the changes in mechanical propensities to consume and to import embedded in the 
complex systems of interregional  relations  in the  two  benchmarks, the results  reveal that the  national 
multiplier for Greece would have increased by 9.6% from 2010 to 2013. However, the general equilibrium 
multiplier is slightly lower in 2013 than in 2010.

Structural features of different states of an economy during the business cycle are often neglected 
in the debate on the impact multipliers of government spending, specially their influence on the supply 
responsiveness of the system. According to our model, in the short run closure, with fixed capital stocks, 
the  supply  elasticity  can  be  approximated  by  the  expression  in  Equation  (32),  reflecting  its  close 
connection with the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, the shares of labor and capital in 
primary factor costs, and the share of primary factors in total costs. In other words, for given values of the 
substitution  elasticity,  supply  is  more  elastic  as  either  the  labor/capital  ratio  is  higher,  or  the  share  of 
materials in total cost is higher (Dixon et al., 1982).

In Greece, changes in factor income were the main factors that help explaining the reduction in 
the  supply  side  elasticity  and,  consequently,  the  output  multiplier  during  the  recession.  The  share  of 
primary factors in total costs decreased from 0.566, in 2010, to 0.546, in 2013. In the same period, the 
ratio of labor payments to capital payments fell from 0.693 to 0.597. Such structural changes reflect the 
policy choices that led to recession. The rapid deterioration of wages and profit rates in the first years of 
the Greek crisis led to lower intensity in value added generation in the economy, with a heavier burden 
on workers. 

Taking into account price effects is also important to distinguish between nominal and real effects. 
With lower sort-run supply elasticity, prices would have responded more sharply to the demand shocks 
in 2013, reducing the relative real output impact of government spending. While nominal GDP rose by 
3.18% in the 2010 simulation, and to 3.42% in the 2013, GDP deflator would have increased, respectively, 
2.84% and 3.10%, leading to a smaller real output multiplier in the more recent year.

However, one important component of Equation (32) is the substitution elasticity, 𝜎3(𝑔+1)
both benchmark years. Another caveat relates to the treatment of idle resources in the model. If, on one 
side, we do take into account the level of unemployment in the workforce, on the other side we do not 
consider differences in the utilization of the capacity of existing capital stocks. It is clear from Figure 2 
that the drop in capacity utilization from 2010 to 2013 may suggest a relatively less costly adjustment to 
capital use in the latter year. Having nothing to say in order to explicitly address this issue in our modeling 
framework, we can play with the model’s parameters to mimic a more flexible supply-side adjustment 
with the existing levels of capital stocks and different levels of capacity utilization in the economy. To 
circumvent this methodological limitation, we carry out sensitivity analysis exercises with the value of 
(1𝑗)𝑟
the  elasticity  of substitution  parameter. Higher values for  𝜎3(𝑔+1)
potentially lead to higher labor absorption in the short run, i.e. with fixed capital stocks, pushing the supply

Table 3 presents the results for different values of the primary factor elasticity of substitution. In 
addition to the benchmark value (0.5), we also run the two models using alternative higher values (1.0 
and 2.0), mimicking progressive lower rates of capacity utilization in the “two Greek economies”. It is 
noteworthy that higher parameter values relates to higher multipliers in each structural setting. Due to the 
lack of empirical evidence, we can only make conjectures about the likely differences of the values of the 
parameter in the two points in time. In light of Figure 2, it would be reasonable to assume that its value in 
2013  would  be  higher  than  that  in  2010,  given  the  fairly  lower  rate  of  capacity  utilization  in  2013. 
Accepting that means that, given the simulated outcomes in Table 2, there would be a threshold difference 
in the magnitude of both years’ parameters that would reverse the conclusion on the magnitude of the 
multiplier in the different states of the Greek economy. In other words, we cannot conclude, under this 
level  of  numerical  uncertainty  in  our  modeling  framework,  whether  the  multiplier  is  smaller  in  the 
recession.

Table 4 reveals the regional dimensions of the nationwide multiplier in the context of integrated 
multiregional  systems.  As  shown  in  Equations  (28)-(31),  the  multiregional  approach  can  provide  the 
reconciliation between local and nationwide multipliers by taking into account both intra and interregional

and interregional substitution effects can influence the adjustment of the system to government spending 
demand  shocks  in  the  local  economies.  From  the  supply  side,  regional  structural  characteristics  from 
Equation (32) play different roles. We calculated, for each of the 13 Greek NUTS-2 regions, the labor to 
capital ratio and the aggregate share of primary factors in total costs. On one hand, we found, for both 
years, strong positive correlation between the latter and the nationwide, source-specific shock, multipliers,

 (58.4% in 2010, and 62.9% in 2013), with no meaningful correlation with the local multipliers, 𝐾(s)
On the other hand, the correlation between the regional ratio of labor payments to capital payments and 
the local multipliers was meaningful in both years and more relevant in 2013 (25.7% in 2010, and 46.2% 
in 2013). This first set of results suggest that, in our context, national output is more influenced by the 
overall value added content in regional production systems, while local effects depend more heavily on 
the ability of regional suppliers to respond promptly to the local demand shocks.

Government  spending  is  heavily  concentrated  in  the  purchase  of  local  goods.8  One  of  its 
consequences is to put pressure on prices of local goods to increase relative to prices of goods produced 
elsewhere, generating a domestic terms of trade effect that switches expenditures away from local goods. 
In  the  case  of  the  potential  impacts  of  government  spending  in  a  specific  region,  we  expect  to  see  a 
reduction in  regional  exports  in interregional  trade and an increase in imports from  other parts of the 
country.9 Another consequence is the rise of local agents’ income that increase their expenditure not only 
on locally produced but also on external goods, irrespective of changes in relative prices (Chodorow-
Reich, 2017).  

Finally,  given  the  supply-constrained  short  run  environment  in  this  cost-competitiveness 
approach,  the  rise  of  local  prices  also  affects  the  international  trade  balance,  hampering  international 
exports  and  increasing  import  penetration.  This  movement  is  important  to  switch  the  allocation  of 
resources towards components of domestic demand. 
 
5. Concluding Remarks 
 

In this paper we developed a multiregional general equilibrium model for Greece to simulate the 
short run impacts of temporary deficit-financed rises in government spending. It has long been recognized 
that the fiscal multiplier is a function of structural features of the economy and policy reaction parameters. 
Moreover, the debate on the magnitude of the multiplier along the business cycle has also been the subject 
of disputed debates. On these grounds, we looked at the Greek case by calibrating the model using data 
for distinct states of the Greek economy during the development of the recent crisis. Whether this matters 
for local and nationwide multipliers depends on qualitative differences of the numerical structures of the 
model. Our results imply that structural coefficients have a strong effect on government spending impact

 in Equation (1)]. Table 8A in the Annex shows the sensitivity analysis of results presented in Table 3 on setting the parameter 
value twice as high. In such case, the size of the local multipliers is reduced at the expense of the interregional multipliers.
