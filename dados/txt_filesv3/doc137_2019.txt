Abstract 
The economic crisis of 2008 resulted in a unique context for the empirical experimentation of organizational 
learning theories and patterns of technological accumulation from Schumpeterian inspiration. This paper 
investigates the effects of the economic crisis on the innovative performance of firms. We examine an 
original database with the patent portfolio of 2309 firms based in Brazil, covering a period of eight years 
preceding the 2008 economic crisis and the five years thereafter. Our finds add to the literature in two ways. 
First,  we  exhibit  evidence  that  despite  the  positive  relationships  between  exploitation  and  exploration 
behaviour and innovative performance widely described in the extant literature, in periods of crisis this 
relationship is curvilinear, in that former exerts diminishing negative effects on the latter. Second, from the 
literature that perceives a clear division between creative destruction and creative accumulation, our results 
tend tends to support the thesis in favour of the existence of a creative accumulation, although consistent 
with the notion of co-occurrence of both models. The article concludes by highlighting what we have learnt 
from this experience and suggesting some new avenues for research.

Resumo 
A crise econômica de 2008 resultou em um contexto único para a experimentação empírica de teorias de 
aprendizagem organizacional e padrões de acumulação tecnológica de inspiração Schumpeteriana. Este 
artigo investiga os efeitos da crise econômica no desempenho inovador das firmas. Examinamos um banco 
de dados original com o portfólio de patentes de 2309 firmas com sede no Brasil, cobrindo um período de 
oito anos antes da crise econômica de 2008 e os cinco anos posteriores. Os resultados se somam à literatura 
de duas maneiras. Em primeiro lugar, apresenta-se evidências de que, apesar das relações positivas entre 
explotação e exploração e desempenho inovador amplamente descrito na literatura existente, em períodos 
de  crise  essa  relação  é  curvilínea,  pela  qual  a  primeira  exerce  efeitos  negativos  decrescentes  sobre  a 
segunda. Segundo, partindo da literatura que percebe uma divisão entre destruição criativa e acumulação 
criativa, nossos resultados tendem a apoiar a tese em favor da existência de um processo de acumulação 
criativa, embora consistente com a noção de coexistência de ambos os modelos. O artigo conclui destacando 
o que aprendemos com essa experiência e sugerindo novas possibilidades de pesquisa.

1. Introduction 
The 2008 economic crisis has stimulated a series of studies analysing how the innovative activity is affected 
by a scenario of huge uncertainties about the direction of technological change, demand conditions, and 
new market opportunities. Evidence suggests the existence of substantive changes in the firm innovation 
process during the downturn (Amore 2015; Teplykh 2018). One of the most outstanding changes is the 
sharp reduction of the firm’s willingness to undertake innovation investments (OECD 2009; Paunov 2012; 
Archibugi, Filippetti, and Frenz 2013b, 2013a). 
From a perspective of industrial dynamics, economic downturns cannot be interpreted as extended periods 
of technological stability and continuity. Despite the obstacles imposed by the credit crunch, economics 
turmoil may result in significant changes in the future trajectory of innovation. The dynamics of innovation 
during recessions is seized by those firms who aspire to innovate during recessions1, especially for the 
possibility to improve its market position in the post-crisis period (Amore 2015). 
Following the Schumpeterian tradition, the unfolding of the crisis unleashes a process of low cumulativity 
and high technological opportunity, so-called creative destruction2. The literature argues that innovation is 
a  result  of  the  novel  integration  of  previously  separate  bodies  of  knowledge  that  has  a  commercial 
application. Accordingly, a crisis is a relevant context for firms to exploit existing knowledge and in this 
way to increase their productivity and efficiency, but also to explore new fields of knowledge and thus 
engage in experimentation and variation. 
Although our intuition makes us believe that a Great Recession opens the way to generalized disruptions, 
changes in the environment are also driven by continuity where the bulk of technological transformations 
is carried out by large and established firms incrementally. Evidence suggests that the 2008 crisis resulted 
in  a  great  concentration  of  innovative  resources  in  fewer  companies  and  old  innovators  have  taken 
advantage of the turbulent environment (Archibugi, Filippetti, and Frenz 2013a). 
The  recent  crisis  has  resulted  in  a  unique  context  for  empirical  experimentation  of  these  approaches, 
however, there remain gaps in the understanding if in periods of crisis there are significant changes in the 
organizational responses that affect their innovative performance. At the same time, there is a lack of studies 
that address how this performance during the crisis is affected by characteristics of the firm and markets 
(such barriers to entry) and type of knowledge sources. Much of the evidence in this regard is disconnected 
or unrelated to the effects of economic crises. 
The objective of this paper is to provide quantitative evidence on these questions by means of a unique 
dataset on the patent portfolio of 2309 firms based in Brazil, covering a period of eight years preceding the 
2008 economic crisis and the five years thereafter. Brazil is a relevant context for the purposes of this 
research given its productive heterogeneity and the existence of structural factors which able to mitigate 
the effects of the economic downturn when compared to its neighbours in Latin America. Nevertheless, the 
country is perceived as late industrializing economies, where the process of technical change is essentially 
a learning process, rather than of innovation (Viotti 2002). 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In the second section, we review the literature and discuss 
the  conceptual  framework.  The  third  section  describes  the  data  and  presents  the  methodology.  Main 
empirical results, robustness tests and extensions are provided in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 discusses the 

                                                 
1  The  Booz  &  Company  (2009)  survey  showed  that  during  the  recession  90%  of  executives  remarked  that  investment  in 
innovation is critical to prepare for the upturn. 
2  This  process  is  related  to  the  insights  proposed  by  the  author  in  Theory  of  Economics  Development  (Schumpeter  1911). 
Archibugi (2013a) draws attention that the term was first employed in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (Schumpeter 1942) 
in which emphasis is placed on the opposite process of creative accumulation.

organizational responses and the patterns of accumulation and destruction after the crisis and also concludes 
with the implications of our analysis. 
2. Theory and hypotheses 
The 2008 economic crisis has encouraged an immediate response by policymakers to avoid a collapse of 
the financial and banking systems and boundary the economic effects of the credit crunch. The effects on 
the firm were inevitable and most firms responded to hostile macroeconomic scenario reducing expenditure 
on investment and innovation and the commitment to engage in long-term activities (Archibugi, Filippetti, 
and Frenz 2013a, 2013b; Paunov 2012).  
Overall, we can say that investments in innovation carried out by the private initiative are largely procyclical 
and decrease significantly during economic downturns (OECD 2009). Evidence suggests that the negative 
effect of the global crisis was widely perceived in European firms that reduced innovation expenditure 
between 2006 and 2008 (Filippetti and Archibugi 2010; Archibugi, Filippetti, and Frenz 2013b). Regarding 
Latin American, even though the innovation performance remained strong during the crisis with more than 
one in three firms innovated in processes and about 24% introduced new products, the shock might have 
had negative effects on firms’ innovation paths since on average one in four firms cut back on innovation 
projects. The main causes reported abandoning innovation investments are the demand shock and financing 
constraints associated with the crisis (Paunov 2012). 
However, this process is heterogeneous and the share of firms stopping innovation projects due to the 
economic crisis is quite different between countries. The work of Filippetti and Archibugi (2010) reveals 
that  some  country  structural  factors  such  as  competences  and  quality  of  the  human  resources,  the 
specialization in the high technology sector and the extent of the financial system can counterbalance the 
effect of the economic downturn on innovation investments. In order to illustrate this heterogeneity, we can 
adopt Latin America as an example. While Argentina and Mexico accounted for the highest percentage of 
firms stopping innovative investments, respectively 43% and 36%, on the other extreme Uruguay and Brazil 
realized the lowest share, with 16% and 12% respectively (Paunov 2012). 
Similar studies also reveal that non-financial obstacles to innovation such as market structure, demand, 
knowledge are at least as important as financial barriers for affecting innovation propensity (Pellegrino and 
Savona 2017). The provision of an efficient credit system in a crisis context is relevant because there is 
evidence that innovative firms find it harder to access finance than other firms (Lee, Sameen, and Cowling 
2015). Estimates suggest that during the crisis, EU manufacturing firms benefiting from research subsidies 
did not reduce the intensity of their total R&D expenditures but, by taking advantage of public grants, they 
preserve their innovative capability (Aristei, Sterlacchini, and Venturini 2017). 
If we investigate the crisis from a different perspective, we observe the share of firms that “swimming 
against the stream” and respond to the crisis through the expansion of investments and innovation. The 
performance of these firms may be the result of two possible scenarios. They can be the most dynamic ones 
that cannot survive without changing their products and services or are newcomers and not necessarily 
involved in innovations in the pre-crisis period (Archibugi, Filippetti, and Frenz 2013a). Despite the last 
scenario, there is evidence that previous experience with innovation during downturns improves the firm’s 
ability to invest in R&D when a new depression hits (Amore 2015). In an econometric study, Sidorkin and 
Srholec (2014) reveal that pre-crisis innovation affects the firm survival odds and performance thereafter. 
However, firms that innovate excessively before the crisis turned out to be far more likely to die. 
In an innovative dynamics through crises, the organizational responses contrast meaningfully according to 
firm size. In general, large firms have greater potential to deal with the shortcomings created by the crisis 
and are most capable to react, although specific situations must be recognized. Evidence indicates that 

4 

 
larger firms reacted to the crisis by making larger investments in both the expansion in international markets 
and new product development (Colombo et al. 2016). Nevertheless, studies also show that small firms 
display a relative growth advantage compared to larger firms in both stable and crisis times, and this is due 
to the flexibility benefit of small size (Bartz and Winkler 2016).  
2.1 Innovation performance and limits for the exploitation and exploration 
The  study  of  how  exploitation  and  exploration  strategies  affect  innovation  performance  has  become  a 
frequent topic  and  has evolved  from  the stream  of  research that investigates the relationships  between 
exploitation, exploration and innovation performance (Greve 2007; He and Wong 2004; Jansen et al. 2006). 
Assuming that innovation is a recombination process by which knowledge components are mixed and 
matched, ones would assume that the crisis can lead to two types of organizational responses. First, the high 
level of uncertainty may lead firms to undertake the local search within the knowledge that lies around the 
organization's  current  knowledge  base.  In  other  words,  local  search  means  to  combine  the  combining 
existing  solutions to  generating  new  combinations.  In the face of  a  financial  crisis,  the  exploitation  of 
existing knowledge may represent the most efficient mode due to its reliability and relatively low costs. 
Second,  the  crisis  can  also  generate  opportunities  for  knowledge  combination  and  recombination  and 
provide completely new solutions. From the non-local search, the firm is enabled to consciously move away 
from current organizational routines and knowledge bases (Katila and Ahuja 2002). 
The pioneering innovation studies perceive organizational routines as an important rule of firm behaviour, 
which can be defined as a standardized set of embedded rules and heuristics, or even “pieces” of activities 
that have a repetitive character (Dosi, Nelson, and Winter 2001). At some point, firms “[…] have built into 
them a set of ways of doing things and ways of determining what to do” (Nelson and Winter 1982, 400). 
Since the routines are not immutable, firms perform search activities whenever they need to “evaluate the 
current routines that lead to their modification, changes or replacement” (Nelson and Winter 1982, 400). 
However, scholars also acknowledge that there are limits to the flexibility of such behaviour and that a 
changing environment may force firms to risk their own survival in attempts to modify their routines. 
Traditionally, this pioneering literature emphasizes that these search processes are performed locally (Dosi 
1982; Nelson and Winter 1982; Patel and Pavitt 1997). Firms need to capture the maximum advantage of 
the set of knowledge they domain, which requires focus, or at least coherence, rather than the random 
distribution of their efforts. The search process is mostly local since it tends to take place along trajectories 
established by past experience, routines and heuristics (Nelson 1991; Winter 1984). Thus, it emphasizes 
the firm’s tendency to focus on technological fields that share the same knowledge base and similarity in 
problem-solving (Dosi 1982; Nelson and Winter 1982; Patel and Pavitt 1997). The main argument for the 
prevalence of local search is the cost of dominate specialized knowledge in the contemporary world, an 
example is the large firms that have knowledge in a large number of technological fields (Pavitt 1998; 
Cantwell and Fai 1999). 
While pioneering innovation literature has emphasized the local character of search processes, it is possible 
to perceive changes in the focus of interpretations on firm behaviour throughout the subsequent literature. 
Laursen (2012), in an overview of the main empirical contributions on the topic, has identified that the 
focus on local search processes have increasingly shifted towards the focus of how the firms balance the 
local search with the non-local search. These later contributions, while recognizing that search processes 
remain largely local, tend to understand how firms can avoid the “local search trap” and balance local and 
non-local search. 
The exploitation behaviour (local search) can be a dominant strategy in different conjunctures. In contexts 
where high complexity prevails in solving problems, the tendency to exploit can be justified by two main 
reasons. The first is the existence of a limited rational behaviour (Simon 1997) which makes the agents 

5 

 
incapable of considering all the possible options for the solution of their technological problems and also 
unable  to  accurately  assess  future  performance  prospects  for  potential  options.  Such  factors  make  the 
evaluation of alternatives tend to be imperfect (Knudsen and Levinthal 2007). On the other hand, as a 
consequence of the local search trap, the firm reduces its competence to deal with future paradigms, even 
though it is developing capabilities that improve its current performance.  
At the other extreme of exploitation behaviour, exploration increases the variety of firm’s knowledge by 
supporting strategies to minimize the risk of obsolescence, which may become a reality after an economic 
stagnation.  In  particular,  exploration  behaviour  that  tends  to  capture  emerging  opportunities  in  crisis 
scenarios,  have  been  associated  with  the  development  of  discontinuous  solutions  and,  ultimately,  new 
technological trajectories (March 1991; Gavetti and Levinthal 2000; Fleming 2001). This brief context 
leads us to our first conjecture: 
Hypothesis 1a. As a result of a crisis, the association between the degree of exploitation and innovation 
performance is curvilinear, in that former exerts diminishing negative effects on the latter. 
Hypothesis 1b. As a result of a crisis, the association between the degree of exploration and innovation 
performance is curvilinear, in that former exerts diminishing negative effects on the latter. 
2.2. Balancing of exploitation and exploration  
The ability of firms to balance exploitation and exploration –so-called organizational ambidexterity (see, 
Lavie et al., (2010), for an expansion) – is a critical element for maintaining its performance over time and 
deal with fluctuations in the economic landscape (Katila and Ahuja 2002; He and Wong 2004; Wang, 
Vrande,  and  Jansen  2017).  Put  differently,  ambidexterity  refers  to  an  organization’s  ability  to  manage 
current  demands  while  being  adaptable  to  changes  in  the  environment  (Gibson  and  Birkinshaw  2004; 
Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). 
It is widely accepted in the literature the idea that firms must “engage in enough exploitation to ensure the 
organization’s current viability and engage in enough exploration to ensure its future viability” (Levinthal 
and March 1993, 105). Even though exploitation and exploration behaviours are complementary actions 
that tend to reinforce each other as they co-occur over time, they can also generate persistent tensions in 
the firm context (Koryak et al. 2018). 
Firms take advantage of the context of uncertainty about demand conditions create by a crisis to incorporate 
new  knowledge  and  shape  their  own  market  opportunities.  Those  firms  that  are  able  to  combine  new 
knowledge with existing knowledge are more likely to offer the market something new and distinctive. 
When the knowledge that is new to a firm increases technological variation, which is valuable for finding 
better  solutions  to  technological  problems  (Katila  and  Ahuja  2002).  In  addition,  incorporating  new 
knowledge into an innovation is likely to open up previously undiscovered technological opportunities and 
potential, which may attract more firms or inventors to follow. Therefore, inventions that draw on some 
new knowledge are likely to be of higher quality than those that only recombine existing knowledge (Wang, 
Vrande, and Jansen 2017). This leads us to conjecture: 
Hypothesis 2. The interaction of the degree of exploitation and exploration during the crisis is positively 
related to innovation performance.

2.3 Crisis and the coexistence of creative destruction and creative accumulation  
Innovative  activities  observed  during  and  after  an  economic  crisis  are shaped  in  different  ways  across 
industries and technologies. The literature shows that there are two possible scenarios for this process. In 
the first, the innovative activities are fashioned by new firms that start to innovate in these periods. These 
firms may be smaller in size and/or entirely new and contest the technological leadership of incumbents. In 
the second, these activities are led by incumbents, which tend to be large in economic terms and use their 
accumulated knowledge to accomplish innovation as a routine and prevent the entrance of newcomers. 
The theoretical foundations of this scenario are based on the original distinction between two main works 
of  Schumpeter  (1911,  1942)  that  authors  of  this  theoretical  tradition  conventionally  have  labelled 
Schumpeterian models Mark I and Mark II (Nelson and Winter 1982; Kamien and Schwartz 1982; Freeman, 
Clark, and Soete 1982). This characterization has been extensively adopted in the literature and continues 
to have critical implications to interpret the patterns of technological change after an exogenous shock 
(Archibugi 2017). The empirical relevance is understanding the innovative activities that are characterized 
by “creative destruction” resulting from the turbulence generated by entry of new innovative firms in the 
market and those innovative activity characterized by “creative accumulation” as result of incumbent’s 
activity that use its technological position to innovate persistently and create barriers for newcomers to 
exploit technological opportunities (Archibugi, Filippetti, and Frenz 2013a). 
Those scholars engaged in measuring these patterns and defined the model Mark I by low concentration 
and  asymmetries  of  innovative  activities,  the  small  size  of  innovators,  low  stability  in  the  ranking  of 
innovators  and  high  entry  of  new  innovators.  Conversely,  the  model  Mark  II  is  defined  as  high 
concentrations and asymmetries of innovative activities, the large size of innovators, high stability in the 
ranking of innovators and low entry of new innovators. The main findings are that these patterns are at the 
same time systematically different across technological classes and very similar at the country level. The 
technological regimes, defined in terms of opportunity, appropriability, cumulativeness and properties of 
the knowledge-base play a dominant role in determining the specific pattern of innovative activities of a 
technological  class  (Malerba  et  al.  1995;  Malerba  and  Orsenigo  1996;  Malerba,  Orsenigo,  and  Peretto 
1997). 
An economic crisis may also be associated with a high degree of turbulence in existing industries. In this 
context, the high technological opportunities and low cumulativeness make easier the entry and exit in 
technological areas. The monopolies generated by innovation are temporary and new innovators constantly 
replace the technological leadership of the established firms (Anderson and Tushman 1990; Christensen 
and Rosenbloom 1995; Archibugi, Filippetti, and Frenz 2013a). These firms may be smaller in size and/or 
entirely new and contest the technological leadership of incumbents. This scenario generates turbulences 
caused by a change in leading technologies disturb the hierarchy of innovators and the emergence of new 
technologies  (Malerba  and  Orsenigo  1999;  Perez  2009).  Note  that  in  some  cases,  the  technological 
discontinuities are driven entirely by incumbents also may result in dramatic shakeouts in industries. Some 
incumbents are capable of absorbing new technologies and integrating them with their existing capabilities 
(Bergek et al. 2013). These ideas lead us to state: 
Hypothesis 3. Increase in innovation performance during the crisis is positively associated with firm size, 
new entrants, and stock of knowledge. 

7 

 
3. Methods  
3.1 Data and sample 
In order to test our hypotheses, we developed a unique database based on information on patent data from 
the  Brazilian  National  Institute  of  Industrial  Property  (Inpi) from  the  first  version  of  the  Intellectual 
Property Database for Statistical Purposes (Badepi). The Badepi database was elaborated at the level of 
2309 firms based in Brazil, excluding institutions and individual inventors. It was also adopted firm-level 
micro-data from the Orbis database in order to discriminate these firms for their economic size and main 
sectors.  We  emphasize  that  we  do  not  use  granted  patents,  partly  because  the  Brazilian  Patent  Office 
publishes the patent data within a few months after the application, while a grant may last several years. 
Consequently, if our sample were based on granted patents we would lose relevant observations. 
3.2 Measures 
3.2.1 Dependent variable 
Our dependent variable is the innovation performance of firms (INNOVPER). Innovation performance has 
been measured in various ways in the literature, such as R&D expenditure, the number of new products, 
and patents. In line with prior studies, we use the cumulative number of patents applied for by a focal firm 
within the five years after the 2008 crisis. A five-year time window is perceived as suitable for assessing 
the firm’s performance (Henderson and Cockburn 1996; Nooteboom et al. 2007; Stuart and Podolny 1996). 
When the firm records a large portfolio of these patents, we have argued that the greater their innovative 
performance. 
This empirical proposal is widely accepted in the literature, despite this fact it is valuable to recognize some 
limitations. First, patent-based indicators are imperfect proxies of innovative performance. Patents are only 
one of the ways to protect a knowledge and inventors can avoid patenting for reasons of secrecy, avoiding 
their public disclosure, or even to not incur the costs of their registration (Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2000). 
On the other hand, there are few cases of economically important inventions that have not been patented 
(Dernis, Guellec, and Van Pottelsberghe De La Potterie 2001). 
Second, there are differences in sectoral propensities to patent that may vary according to technological 
regimes. These differences are also caused by variations in the rigour with which patent offices apply 
intellectual property rights. Thus, increased patenting activity may reflect a greater innovative performance 
but also a greater propensity to grant a patent (Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2000). In this article, the adoption 
of the Brazilian office as the exclusive source of data and the use of appropriate methodologies partially 
solves this problem. 
3.2.2 Independent and control variables 
According to the purpose of this work, we focus on two groups of explanatory variables in which we believe 
to  explain  the  international  inventive  performance  of  firms.  The  first  group  refers  to  the  degree  of 
exploitation and exploration undertaken by the firm and the second to its capacity of assimilation and stock 
of knowledge. In the first group of variables, we were inspired by previous studies (Ahuja and Katila 2004) 
and operationalized the degree of exploitation and exploration by the intensity in which the firm reuses or 
incorporates new IPCs in its patent portfolio, in the period pre and post 2008 crisis. 
The variable degree of exploitation (INEXPLOIT) describes the accumulation of practice with the same 
knowledge. We state that the more frequently a firm has used knowledge, the more deeply it knows it. 
Hence, the degree of exploitation was measured as the average number of times a firm repeatedly used the 
IPC in the patents it applied for. The variable degree of exploitation is operationalized by calculating the 

8 

 
number of times that, on average, each IPC in the five years post-crisis was repeatedly used compared to 
eight years pre-crisis.  
The variable degree of exploration of new knowledge (INEXPLOR) is the proportion of IPC used for the 
first time in the post-crisis compared to the eight years prior to the crisis. We suggest assessing the share of 
IPCs during this period that was not on the list of patents applied by that firm in the eight years prior to the 
crisis. The values for this variable range from 0 to 1. 
The measure of the degree of exploitation and exploration can be exemplified by considering a firm with a 
portfolio of ten patents that are related to ten IPCs. On average, eight of the ten IPCs are new to the firm, 
in other words, they were used for the first time during the five years. The firm's exploration degree is 
therefore 0.8. Of the remaining two IPCs that were repeated, the firm used each patent one of them twice 
and the other three times. Therefore, the degree of exploitation for this firm is 0.5. 
The  second  group  of  independent  variables  tests  the  explanatory  potential  of  the  assimilation  capacity 
(ASSIMCAP).  We  operationalized  this  variable  by  measuring  firms’  patent  portfolio  dispersion  across 
four-digit IPC. This choice is based on organizational research and innovation management. An example 
of this theoretical foundation is provided by Lane, Koka and Pathak (2006) when claiming that “the breadth 
of  knowledge  that  a  firm  understands  determine  how  far  its  exploratory  learning  can  venture  from  its 
existing knowledge base”. 
The greater the dispersion of a firm’s technological profile, the higher its ability to assimilate external 
technologies in distant, unacquainted knowledge domains. We estimate this ability by the complement to 
one of the Herfindahl index applied to firm patent portfolio composition. This index reflects the degree of 
dispersion of the green patents across different technological (four-digit IPC) classes and varies between 0 

 where 𝛼(cid:3036) is the share of patents in green IPC class i in the firm stock of patents. The 

and 1: 1(cid:3398)∑ 𝛼(cid:3036)(cid:2870)
(cid:3041)(cid:3036)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)

higher the index, the broader the scope of the firms’ technological expertise and therefore, the more likely 
it will be able to enter new technologies. Firms with a dispersed green patent portfolio have learned to 
manage different technologies and therefore should display a better ability to enter into a new technological 
field compared with firms endowed with a narrow green technological portfolio. 
Firms  with  different  portfolio  sizes  have  different  inventive  performances.  We  control  the  stock  of 
knowledge  of  firms  through  the  number  of  patents  accumulated  in  pre-crisis  periods  (KSTOCK).  The 
construction  of  this  variable  is  originally  inspired  by  the  accumulation  function  of  Popp  (2012),  but 
excluding the diffusion component, as proposed by Costantini e Mazzanti (2012). In the same way, as 
agreed by the literature, this variable considers a depreciation rate of 15% (Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg 
2005). 
We further suggested controls for large firms, in which some would expect to have a greater ability to deal 
with the crisis environment, from the creation of dummies for medium-sized, large and very large firms. 
We control for firm size by creating a categorical variable based on the number of employees less than 15 
(small firm), between 15 and 150 (medium firm), between 150 and 1,000 (large firm), and greater than 
1,000 (very large firm)3. We also control the possible effects that can occur within the sector of performance 
of the firms, using the 12 NACE Rev.2 sections. Both control variables were constructed from the extraction 
of the Bureau van Dijk database (Orbis 2013). 

                                                 
3 Considering that Orbis microdata combine several databases, it is possible that this categorical variable is also obtained by total 
assets or operation revenue.

3.3 Econometric method 
Given that our dependent variable is a count variable with non-negative integer values, we employ the 
negative  binomial  (NB)  model.  In  patent-based  studies,  where  over-dispersion  in  the  data  are  often 
observed, this model is more appropriate than a Poisson regression, where the variance of the random 
variable must be constrained to equal the average (Greene 2012). Thus, the use of a negative binomial 
model to analyse count data to control heterogeneity has a long tradition in the literature (Hausman, Hall, 
and Griliches 1984). The data of this study has demonstrated significant evidence of overdispersion since 
the variances largely exceed the relative averages (See Table 2).  
Furthermore, to control for this overdispersion in the data, we report results with robust standard errors. 
While the reverse causality problem is not an immediate concern of our  model, we recognize that the 
omitted variable bias is capable of affecting our estimates. In order to partially address this problem, we 
included a set of control variables that consider the firm size and economic activities. 
4. Results 
As discussed, the main dependent variable of the model is a count variable with non-negative integer values 
and  able  to  estimate  the  innovative  performance  (INNOVPER).  The  empirical  exercises  have  as  main 
independent variables the degree of exploitation (INEXPLOIT) and exploration (INEXPLOR), and also the 
assimilation capacity (ASSIMCAP) and knowledge of stock (KSTOCK). In order to analyse the non-linear 
relations between innovation performance and degree of exploitation and exploration, we convert both last 
into a quadratic variable. We predict that search exploitation and exploration leverage each other, yielding 
a combined positive effect on innovation performance. Therefore, we multiply the former by the later and 
interpret it as a moderating effect.  
The  other  variables  control the  firms  that  are  medium  (DMEDIUM),  large  (DLARGE)  and  very  large 
(DVLARGE), the number of technological classes (NCLASS) in the patent portfolio and their economic 
sectors  based  on  NACE  Rev.2  sections.  In  order  to  control  the  effect  of  newcomers,  the  variable 
(DNEWCO) was proposed. Table 1 describes the variables were chosen to compose the regression models.

Variable name  Description 
INNOVPER 
INEXPLOIT 

Index of innovative performance – count of patents applications in the five years after the 2008 crisis. 
Index of the degree of exploitation – the number of times that, on average, each IPC in the post-crisis was 
repeatedly used compared to eight years pre-crisis.
Index of the degree of exploration – the proportion of IPC used for the first time in the post-crisis compared 
to the eight years prior to the crisis.
Assimilation capacity – measured by the breadth of the firm portfolio (complement of the HHI). 
Firm knowledge stock – number of patents accumulated by the firm in the eight years prior to the crisis. 
Number of technological classes in the firms' patent portfolio. 
Dummy indicating the newcomers who innovate in the post-crisis.

Table 2 provides descriptive statistics and correlations for all variables. We emphasize that are a few values 
in the correlation table that exceed 0.5. We check the variance inflation factor (VIF) values for all variables 
and find that VIFs for our models are all less than 7. Therefore, we assume that there does not seem to be 
a risk of biased estimated due to their multicollinearity.

Regarding the econometric estimates of the relationship between innovative performance, organizational 
responses  (exploitation  and  exploration),  Table  3  presents  the  negative  binomial  estimates  of  the 
coefficients. The econometric exercises begin with the Model 1 which reports estimation results for the 
baseline model. Models 1-5 we include the explanatory variables of interest one-by-one along with the 
controls, while Model 6 contain all variables and interactions. For the sake of simplicity, we focus our 
discussion on the full model in column 6. 
The models 1-6 reveal that the variable INEXPLOIT is positive and in the majority significant. Considering 
the prediction of a curvilinear association between degree of exploitation and innovation performance, the 
hypothesis 1a is supported. In the Model 6, the variable INEXPLOIT squared is negative and significant (β 
= -0.003 and p < 0.001). Similar results were also found for the degree of exploration which supports its 
curvilinear relationship with the innovative performance predicted in hypothesis 2b. In the Model 6, the 
variable INEXPLOR squared is negative and significant (β = -1.309 and p < 0.05). 

The inverted U-shaped relationship reveals that the dependent variable 𝑦(cid:3036) first increases relative to the 
independent variable 𝑥(cid:3036)  at a decreasing rate until it reaches a maximum point, from which 𝑦(cid:3036) decreases at 
an  increasing  rate  as 𝑥(cid:3036)    continues  to  increase.  To  provide  evidence  of  a  U-shaped  relationship,  the 
dependent variable 𝑦(cid:3036)  is  regressed on the independent variable 𝑥(cid:3036)  and its square. The  most common 
Thus, a negative 𝛾 with statistical significance indicates an inverted U-shaped relationship and a positive 
U-shaped 𝛾 only. However, a significant γ coefficient is a necessary but not sufficient condition to establish 

𝑦(cid:3036)(cid:3404)𝛼(cid:3397)𝛽𝑥(cid:3036)(cid:3397)𝛾𝑥(cid:3036)(cid:2870)(cid:3397)𝜉(cid:4593)𝑧(cid:3036)(cid:3397)𝜀(cid:3036) 

specification of this equation in its quadratic form is given by: 

a quadratic relation. In response to this condition, this paper performed the three stages of the tests for the 
diagnosis  of  the  U-shaped  relationship  suggested  by  Lind  and  Mehlum  (2010).  In  all  cases,  the  tests 
suggested corroborated the diagnosis of the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship. 
Hypothesis 2 predicts that during the crisis the interaction of the degree of exploitation and exploration 
exerts a moderating effect and leverage each other. In this case, the results are inconclusive both in terms 
of the positive or negative relation form and significance. In Models 4 and 6 the relationship with the 
innovative performance is negative but Model 5 is positive. Moreover, only in models 5 and 6 the variable 
has significance. Consequently, this hypothesis cannot be supported. 
Pertaining to Hypothesis 3, we test the idea that innovation performance during the crisis is positively 
associated with firm size, new entrants, and stock of knowledge. The dummies for firm size control reveal 
that  there  is  a  positive  relationship  between  innovative  performance  and  medium  (DMEDIUM),  large 
(DLARGE) and very large (DVLARGE) firms but there is significance only for firms of large and very 
large  size.  Regarding  the  relationship  between  innovative  performance  and  the  role  of  newcomers

(DNEWCO), the results are inconclusive. There seems to be a positive relationship between variables, but 
it is not significant in most models. Still, on this hypothesis, the stock of knowledge (KSTOCK) seems to 
have  a  negative  relationship  with  the  innovative  performance,  which  contradicts  our  initial  intuition. 
However, in all models, this variable has no significance at conventional levels.

Our empirical exercise is subject to restrictions that need to be reported. First, we register a large number 
of newcomer firm, that is, those who innovate for the first time in the post-crisis period. At the same time, 
hypothesis 3 makes us question about the role of these firms in the innovative performance of the post-
crisis. Second, since these firms do not have patent applications in the pre-crisis period, both degree of 
exploitation  and  degree  of  exploration  will  be  dichotomous  and  will  only  take  two  values,  zero  for 
exploitation (since all IPC is not repeated) and one for exploration (given that all IPC is new for the firm). 
We analyse these possible restrictions by performing the same regression routines for a sample of 614 firms 
(henceforth so-called “persistent innovators”) and applied patents in both periods studied. Therefore, we 
aim to overcome the possible restrictions reported and make our results even more robust. The negative 
binomial estimates of these coefficients are reported in Table 4.

As in the previous routine, the econometric exercises begin with the Model 7 that estimates the results for 
the baseline model. Models 8 and 9 include the explanatory variables one-by-one along and also controls, 
and the Model 10 contains all variables and interactions. The results presented in the models 8-10 reinforce 

14 

 
the first hypotheses of the existence of a curvilinear association between the degree of exploitation and 
exploration with innovation performance. From the Model 10 the variable INEXPLOIT squared is negative 
and significant (β = -0.003 and p < 0.001) and the variable INEXPLOR squared is negative and significant 
(β = -1.577 and p < 0.001). The evaluation of these coefficients for the sample of innovative persistent firms 
ensures robust results and eliminates doubt about the effects of reducing the variability of the explanatory 
variables of the newcomers. The variable assimilation capacity (ASSIMCAP) remains significant in all 
models and the variable stock of knowledge remains insignificant (KSTOCK). Dummies for large and very 
large firms remain positive but lose significance in most cases. Finally, we conclude the results on these 
two subsets are similar and do not impact on the conclusions that we draw from the results of the full 
sample. 
5. Discussion and Conclusion 
This study draws attention to the effects of the economic crisis on the innovative performance of firms. 
Moving beyond a broad literature dealing with these variables in aggregate terms, this paper proposes a 
firm-level approach with a focus on organizational responses. This objective requires a careful effort to 
investigate the links between macroeconomic effects and responses within firms. Therefore, we developed 
a unique database with the patent portfolio of 2309 firms based in Brazil, covering a period of eight years 
preceding the 2008 economic crisis and the five years thereafter. 
The empirical results are manifold and are presented in two main groups. First, on organizational responses 
and the second on patterns of accumulation and technological destruction after the crisis. Our results reveal 
that after a crisis, the innovative performance is positively associated with the adoption of exploitative 
strategies that aim at the use of knowledge that was already applied by the firm in the period before the 
crisis.  At  the  same  time,  this  performance  is  also  positively  associated  with  the  application  of  new 
knowledge and not used by firms before the crisis. 
Previous literature has broad evidence of these results in other contexts, but the evidence of the curvilinear 
relationship  is  less  conclusive.  We  exhibit  evidence  that  despite  these  positive  relationships,  both 
exploitation and exploration strategies exert diminishing negative effects on innovative performance. We 
argue  that  uncertainties  about  technological  trajectories  and  market  conditions  that  arise  after  the 
instauration of a crisis, create obstacles to the continuity of exploitation and exploration strategies, reducing 
their effects on innovative performance. 
Our results also show that in contexts of economic crisis, the balance between exploitation and exploration 
is not a guarantee of maintaining high innovative performance. This result draws attention to the importance 
of the contextual conditions that ensure some firms manage ambidextrous activities, that is, the capacity to 
encompass relatively high levels of both exploitation and exploration. This discussion also recognizes the 
high  imperfection  of  this  measure  that  it  takes  no  account  for  the  absolute  level  of  exploitative  and 
exploratory activities (Laursen 2012). 
The second group of results is framed through two well-established scenarios: the creative destruction and 
creative accumulation. In order to establish these scenarios, we follow the literature that perceives a clear 
division  between  these  dimensions  and  demonstrate  that  creative  accumulation  tends  to  prevail  under 
normal conditions and creative destruction appears in times of crisis.  
Our study examines these dimensions from three main characteristics. First, on the characteristics of firms, 
the innovative performance of firms in the post-crisis period is positively associated with the performance 
of  firms  of  large  and  very  large  size.  Second,  regarding  the  high  barriers  to  entry  due  to  the  relative 
importance of appropriation and accumulation of knowledge and high costs of innovation, our findings 
showed that there is no evidence that innovative performance is associated with newcomers. Finally, on the 

15 

 
relevance of past innovations and accumulated knowledge, the innovative performance does not seem to 
be positively associated with the stock of knowledge prior to the crisis (measured by cumulative patent 
applications). 
The analysis of these characteristics allows us to conclude that established innovators are the most capable 
to  seize  opportunities  and  take  advantage  of  turbulent  environments  (Archibugi,  Filippetti,  and  Frenz 
2013a). Nevertheless, the absolute number of newcomers in the post-crisis environment is also remarkable 
draws our attention to the low barriers to entry and the possible technological dynamics in subsequent 
periods. 
Another possible conclusion is that post-crisis innovators are large and very large in economic terms. This 
result is the most expected because it reinforces a broad literature on the subject. However, the result that 
tests our intuition is that the previous stock of knowledge does not determine the innovative performance 
in the post-crisis period. Put differently, despite some level accumulated knowledge is required, ownership 
of a large stock of knowledge does not ensure the performance in these contexts. Similarly, this result seems 
to be similar to that found by Sidorkin and Srholec (2014) and Amore (2015). 
Finally,  although  our  evidence  tends  to  support  the  thesis  in  favour  of  the  existence  of  a  creative 
accumulation, the scenario portrayed is more complex and consistent with the notion of co-occurrence of 
both creative destruction and creative accumulation (models Mark I and Mark II). This result is also in line 
with the idea put forth by Archibugi, Filippetti, and Frenz (2013a). 
Our study broadens the extant research in the following directions. First, it contributes to the literature on 
the  effects  of  economic  expansions  and  depressions  on  firm-level  innovative  activity.  In  this  research 
agenda,  our  study  contributes  to  broadening  our  understanding  of  the  relationships  between 
macroenvironmental  changes  and  organizational  responses.  Second,  we  contribute  to  the  literature  on 
technological  search  reporting  empirical  evidence  of  how  far  the  relationship  between  innovative 
performance and technological search is maintained in different environmental contexts. This contributions 
also bears some implications for policy. While policy should support persistent innovators who make efforts 
even in adverse environments, this policy should also provide favourable environments to encourage new 
innovative firms.
