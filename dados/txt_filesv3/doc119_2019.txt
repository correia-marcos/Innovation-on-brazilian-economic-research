Abstract
This article is aimed at contributing to the challenges and pitfalls faced by the antitrust authorities in the identiﬁcation
process of anti-competitive market behavior. We propose two econometric models to select possible cases to be
investigated: (i) The Markov-Switching GARCH (MSGARCH) Models; (ii) The Local Gaussian Correlation (LGC)
approach. We compare both models. Our results indicate that the LGC model, based on the correlation of the resale
price margin and the variability of prices, may provide a biased estimation of the likelihood that a market is practicing
cartel. The MSGARCH model, based only on the log deviation of the gasoline sale price, showed a better accuracy in
cartel detection.

Resumo
Esse artigo busca contribuir com as autoridades antitruste na identiﬁcação de comportamento anticompetitivo no
mercado de varejo de gasolina. Dois modelos econométricos são propostos: (i) Markov-Switching GARCH (MS-
GARCH); (ii) Correlação Gaussiana Local (CGL). Comparando-se os dois modelos, há indícios de que o CGL,
baseado na correlação da margem de preço de revenda e na variabilidade de preços, pode viesar a probabilidade de
um mercado estar cartelizado. O modelo MS-GARCH, baseado apenas no log-desvio do preço de venda da gasolina
no varejo, mostrou-se melhor na detecção de cartéis.

1. Introduction

Frequently, gasoline markets are accused of cartel formation. Given the persistence of anti-competitive behavior
in the industry, the best way to investigate and identify them are relevant issues. In an environment where the number
of complaints and suspicions of cartels is increasing and, given the restriction of resources available to initiate an
investigation, the econometric methods of screening and ﬁltering are useful tool. As we can see in [16], these problems
in cartel identiﬁcation have led to a prominent new ﬁeld of research in the last decades, but there is still no universal
method in Economics that allows us to infer about the existence of cartel in a certain market.
In this sense, the
economic evidence is insuﬃcient, maintaining the need for a criminal investigation. However, the econometric ﬁlters
may reduce the authorities’ search eﬀort by ordering the most likely candidates for the cartel.

One of the key variables used to chart the behaviour of cartels, capable of transmitting information about how the
market works and its strategic decisions, is the retail price. There are several works following this literature1. In light

of these contributions, this paper is aimed at collaborating with the antitrust authorities in the analysis of behavioural
patterns of cartelized markets, as well as in the task of distinguishing them from competitive behaviour.

In order to achieve our objective, we apply both the MSGARCH and the LGC models for screening and ﬁltering
markets with greater indications of cartel. As far as we are concerned, this is the ﬁrst paper that empirically evaluates
the performance of a MSGARCH model in the Brazilian gasoline retail market. Speciﬁcally, our objective is to
analyze the market behaviour of the following cities: (i) Brasília (DF), the capital of Brazil; (ii) Goiânia (GO), a city
in the vicinity of Brasília; (iii) Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and (iv) São Paulo (SP). We used continuous weekly price data
provided by ANP2 between 2014 and 2017. The choice of these cities is justiﬁed by their relevance in the market. In
addition, the city of Brasília was recently judged and condemned by CADE3 for cartel practice. Thus, we have a good
way of evaluating the accuracy of the proposed models in identifying cartels.

In this regard, our research is related to cartel detection through dynamic pricing. As reported in [22, 43],
economists widely apply this methodology in an attempt to generate patterns of collusive behaviour and, from then
on, to formulate and validate a speciﬁc hypotheses, in order to distinguish a competitive pattern from the collusive
one. The seminal contribution in this ﬁeld of research came from [29], where the authors provide a game theoretic
foundations for the classic kinked demand curve equilibrium and Edgeworth cycle. The analysis is based on a model
in which ﬁrms take turns choosing prices. By using the Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE) concept, they conclude
that a ﬁrm’s move in any period depends only on the other ﬁrm’s current price.

Using a Markov-switching regression model to estimate both prevalence and structural characteristics of the pric-
ing patterns, [31] analyzes dynamic pricing in 19 Canadian cities over 574 weeks. The author ﬁnds that sticky-pricing
(cycles) is more prevalent when there are few (many) small ﬁrms. [42] studies oligopoly ﬁrms’ dynamic pricing
strategies in the Australian gasoline market before and after the introduction of a unique law that constrains ﬁrms to
set price simultaneously and only once per day. The observed pricing behaviour, both before and after law implemen-
tation, is well captured by the Edgeworth price cycle equilibrium in the Maskin and Tirole dynamic oligopoly model.
Thus, the results highlight the importance of price commitment in tacit collusion.

As shown in [26], the role of price leadership in coordinating price increases in cycling gasoline retail markets in
the U.S. The author concludes that the ﬁrst price increases tend to stem from retail chains that operate a large number
of stations. Following this approach, [12] used court documents from a gasoline cartel in Canada to characterize the
strategies played by heterogeneous ﬁrms to collude and highlight the role of transfers based on adjustment delays
during price changes. The cartel leaders systematically allowed the most eﬃcient ﬁrms to move last during price-
increase episodes in order to compensate. Furthermore, [13] use weekly station-level price data from before and after
the cartel’s collapse to compare pricing behaviour in stations aﬀected and unaﬀected by the investigation. The results
indicate that collusion is associated with asymmetric price adjustments and high margins.

In contrast, following the arguments presented in [39], we use price series rather than margin4 because there is an
ambiguity5 in the reasons behind the behaviour that sustains the cartels. For example, if the proﬁt margin decreases,
how can you be sure that this is not a period of punishment after some ﬁrm has cheated a cartel agreement? So, the
decrease in the proﬁt margin should not be seen merely as an indicator of competition, since ﬁrms may be punishing
those who deviated. To sum up, in one hand, cartel can lead to an increase in the proﬁt margin. On the other hand, it
may have a punishment phase with lower proﬁts, but this will still be an anti-competitive behaviour. We can say that
this aspect is a limitation in the methodology of the antitrust authority if the data is restricted in a short period of time.
Other behavioural issues of economic agents may aﬀect the price variance in the market under analysis. Firms
in collusion can practice parallel price behaviour, that is, ﬁrms adjust their prices identically and simultaneously, for
some common factor6 of knowledge between them. Such conduct would lead to a similar trajectory of prices among

4 [5] propose a regime-switching model based on mean-reverting and local volatility processes to comprise the market structure of the French
fuel retail market. By analyzing the volatility of prices and margins, the authors provided a better understanding of the behaviour of oligopolies. In
this same market, [34] found evidence of tacit collusion from the margin analysis, but they emphasize that, the collusive behavior in the gasoline
market is still an open question.

5Theoretically, the stability of the cartel depends on the ability of ﬁrms to detect and punish the defectors. To implement the punishment
mechanism, cartelized ﬁrms can reduce price and, consequently, proﬁt margin. However, this behaviour of reduction of the retail price is compatible
with that expected in a market environment in which there is an eﬀective competition - without collusion of the ﬁrms.

ﬁrms, resulting in a low variance7. Related to the structural changes in the price series over time, [7, 24] argue that
when ﬁrms have a low discount rate on future earnings, collusion equilibrium is given with equal prices.

Besides that, when ﬁrms exercise some market power, they can also act asymmetrically in the relation between
product pricing and cost structure. In this way, the greater the cartel’s interference in price formation, the lower the
price-to-cost ratio. There is an extensive literature8 dealing with the problem of asymmetry in collusive markets,
with a reasonable consensus on the non-linearity of the relationship between price variations and cost adjustments in
collusive markets. Another remarkable feature of collusive markets, according to [33], refers to coeﬃcients of price
variation, which may be relatively diﬀerent in non competitive markets.

In order to reach our purpose and develop the discussion shown in this introduction, the remainder of this paper
is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology and the database. Section 3 brings the results of the
empirical analysis. Section 4 shows our conclusions. Section 5 shows the appendix, in which it is possible to ﬁnd
detailed tables with information about the estimation of the models, as well as the validation of some asymptotic
properties.

2. Methodology

In this section, we begin with a brief description of the Brazilian fuel market and the database provided by ANP.
Then, we introduce the methodology used to model the behavioural pattern of the gasoline sales market between
January 2014 and December 2017 in Brasília (DF), Goiânia (GO), Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and São Paulo (SP). Next, we
will describe the Markov-Switching Model, in line with [19, 5]. Then, we will explain the Local Gaussian Correlation
approach, as proposed by [37].

2.1. Characteristics of the Brazilian Gasoline Market

According to the exposed in [15], the composition of the price of gasoline in the Brazilian market went through
many changes over the years9. Until the middle of 1990, the Brazilian State interfered in distribution and resale of
automotive fuels, controlling prices, margins of sale and freight. However, the price liberation process was initiated
throughout the oil production chain. Thus, in 1996, the prices of automotive gasoline were released in the wholesale
and retail trade units, as well as the sales margins of the resellers and distributors in the South, Southeast and Northeast
regions. In 1997, the Petroleum Law10 was published, which created the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum
(ANP), whose function is to regularize the Brazilian fuel market. In addition, it allowed for a new model to enter
into force, leaving behind the monopoly of the oil sector, hitherto exercised by Petrobras S.A, and opening up the fuel
market in Brazil. Finally, the most recent change that is still in force today was the one that occurred in 2002. The
main objective of the opening was to create a competitive market, avoiding cartel situations in the sector. Thus, since
this period, gasoline imports have been released and the price has been deﬁned by the market.

2.2. The ANP Sampling of the Fuel Retail Price

One of the roles of the ANP is to preserve the competitiveness of the fuel sector. Thus, there are several eﬀorts to
defend competition and consumer welfare in the pursuit of economic eﬃciency. It is also the ANP that provides the
database11 to CADE to be analyzed at the administrative level of complaints about cartel practices in the fuel retail
market. With this set of information, it is possible to have a preliminary investigation signalling whether there is any
cartel behaviour or not in a certain city. Therefore, the database used in this paper is the same as that used by CADE.
With this in mind, the development of the ANP sampling is described as follows. The price collection service, as
stated in [32, 17], is developed through the structuring and execution of the following steps: (i) weekly collection of
sales prices to the ﬁnal consumer and the corresponding acquisition prices by the economic agents selected to integrate

10The law 9.478/97, which is available at http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/L9478.htm.
11The database is composed of, among other pieces of information, the evolution of fuel prices (buying and selling), the evolution of the resale

margin and the coeﬃcient of variation between prices.

the sample deﬁned by the ANP; (ii) quality control of the information; (iii) data entry into the system; (iv) creation of
a database containing the information speciﬁed through contracts; and (v) forwarding the results to the ANP.

Field planning within each municipality is based on a geographical identiﬁcation (plotting) of the resale points
within the sample. The determination of the weekly collection routes in each of the municipalities is carried out
based on the registration data of resellers to be forwarded by the ANP and the quantity deﬁned in the sample design.
The main objective of the distribution of the points of sale is to optimize the geographical representation of each of
them. Considering the number of resale points in the total sample determined for each municipality and the criteria
listed above, a random sample selection is made by the company conducting the survey to be collected weekly. In the
selection procedures, however, we must observe the geographic coverage of the municipality as well as guarantee the
randomness.

2.3. Price Volatility with Markov-Switching GARCH Models

The MSGARCH parameters vary dynamically according to an unobservable variable. In this way, we can use it
to identify changes in model behaviour. Another good property of these models, according to [28, 3], is their fast
adaptation to the observed perturbations in unconditional volatility. Therefore, a better statistical inference process
is possible as well as a better prediction of the variable of interest. In order to verify how well the model is able to
capture the characteristics of the markets used in this article, a broad empirical analysis was carried out.

In order to better evaluate the impact of the estimation methods on the performance of the MSGARCH12 model,
both Bayesian13 estimation techniques and the traditional maximum likelihood14 (ML) estimation will be used. In
many situations, the Bayesian approach has been shown to be more advantageous, since the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) procedure is able to explore the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters.

2.4. MSGARCH Model Speciﬁcation
and t − 1, which is our variable of interest, zt, is given by

Let pt denote the gasoline sales price (per liter) in the retail market at time t. Then, the price variation between t

zt =

pt − pt−1
pt−1

≈ log(pt) − log(pt−1).

Thus, we assume the following conditions: E[zt] = 0 and E[ztzt−(cid:96)] = 0 for (cid:96) (cid:44) 0 and all t > 0. The Markov-

Switching GARCH speciﬁcation is given by the following expression:

zt|(mt = k, It−1) ∼ D(0, hk,t, ξk),

(1)
In (1), we denote by It−1 the information set observed up to time t − 1, that is, It−1 ≡ {zt−i, i > 0}. The con-
15 assembles additional
tinuous distribution D(0, hk,t, ξk) has zero mean and time-varying variance hk,t. The vector ξk
shape parameters. The stochastic variable, mt, which is an integer number and takes discrete values between 1, ..., K,
characterizes the MSGARCH model. Standardized innovations are deﬁned as

λk,t ≡ zt(cid:112)hk,t

iid∼ D(0, 1, ξk).

2.4.1. The Dynamics of the State Variable

Following [5], two procedures are implemented in order to capture the dynamics of the state variable. As shown
in [19], a ﬁrst-order ergodic homogeneous Markov chain is assumed to distinguish the MSGARCH model. Depart-
ing from a multinomial distribution and assuming the hypothesis of independent draws, we typify the mixture of

13See [4, 9, 10].
14See [19, 28, 8].
15See [6] for details.

GARCH models as [18]. The ﬁrst-order Markov-chain, mt, evolves in accordance to an unobserved ﬁrst-order ergodic
homogeneous Markov chain with K × K transition probability matrix P:

state mt = j. By intuition, we see that the constraints 0 < pi, j < 1 ∀i, j ∈ {1, ..., K}, and(cid:80)K

in which the term pi, j ≡ P[mt = j|mt−1 = i] corresponds to the transition probability from the state mt−1 = i to the
j=1 pi, j = 1, ∀i ∈ {1, ..., K}
is sustained. Given the parametrization of D(·), we have E[z2
t |mt = k, It−1] = hk,t. In other words, hk,t represents the
variance of zt conditional on mt = k.
The Mixture of GARCH established by [18] introduces a speciﬁcation related to the independent states. By doing
so, the random sampling process is done independently over time, in addition to considering a Multinomial distribution
of dimension {1, ..., K}. The term P[mt = k] = ωk is the probability vector given by ω = (ω1, ..., ωK)T. Thus, the same
parametric formulation of (1) with K several GARCH-type models is deﬁned for each element of the mixture16.

2.4.2. Conditional Variance Dynamics

17:

As in [19, 6], the conditional variance of the variable of interest, zt, follows a GARCH-type speciﬁcation. There-
fore, hk,t depends on the regime mt = k and corresponds to a function of the past observation, zt−1, past variance, hk,t−1,
and the Θk
(2)
where the term h(·) is a function dependent on the information set available at time t − 1, given by It−1. It also deﬁnes
the appropriate ﬁlter for conditional variance and guarantees its positivity. In the MSGARCH model proposed by
[5], the variance is estimated recursively and its start values, that is, hk,1(k = 1, ..., K), are assumed to be equal to the
unconditional variance in regime k. Depending on the parameters observed in (·), we obtain diﬀerent speciﬁcations
for the variance of the error term. It is useful to reduce the model complexity.

hk,t ≡ h(zt−1, hk,t−1, Θk),

2.5. Conditional Distribution

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian or standard normal distribution, is the probability distribution
that plots all of its values in a symmetrical fashion, and most of the results are situated around the probability’s mean.
Values are equally likely to plot either above or below the mean. Grouping takes place at values close to the mean
and then tails oﬀ symmetrically away from the mean. The probability density function (PDF) of the standard Normal
distribution is given by:

The PDF of the standardized generalized error distribution (GED19) is given by:

where ν > 0 is the shape parameter. By considering ν = 1 (ν = 2), the Laplace (Normal) distribution is obtained. If
ν → ∞, then the Uniform distribution is obtained.

variances.

2.6. MSGARCH Model Estimation
The MSGARCH models can be estimated either by ML or by MCMC (Bayesian) techniques. For this, it is
necessary to evaluate the likelihood function.. By doing so, let z ≡ (z1, ..., zt)T be the vector of T observations and let
ψ ≡ (Θ1, ξ1, ..., ΘK, ξK, P) be the vector of the model parameters. The likelihood function is:

L(MS GARCH)(ψ|I) ≡ T(cid:89)

f (zt|ψ, It−1),

(3)
in which f (zt|ψ, It−1) corresponds to the density of zt given past observations, It−1, and the model parameters ψ. The
conditional density of zt for the MSGARCH is given by:

t=1

pi, jzi,t−1 fD(zt|mt = j, ψ, It−1),

(4)

and the ﬁltered probability of the state i observed in t − 1 is represented by zi,t−1 ≡ P[t−1= i|ψ, It−1]. It is obtained via
Hamilton’s ﬁlter 20. Analogously, the conditional density of zt for the MSGARCH is:

ω j fD(zt|mt = j, ψ, It−1).

(5)

j=1

In equations (4) and (5), for a certain ψ and It−1, the conditional density of zt in state mt = k is deﬁned as
fD(zt|mt = k, ψ, It−1). Through the maximization of equation (3), the ML estimator, ˜ψ, is obtained. Following [3]
for the MCMC estimation, the likelihood function is combined with a truncated prior f (ψ). In sequence, the kernel
of the posterior distribution f (ψ|y) is generated. As the posterior is of an unknown shape, simulation techniques are
required. For both ML and MCMC estimations, positivity and covariance-stationarity constraints of the conditional
variance in each regime are ensured during the estimation and are stronger than those derived by [19]. Nevertheless,
it allows for an insertion of a wider range of conditional variance speciﬁcations and distributional assumptions in our
model. In the next subsection, we present the Local Gauss Correlation approach. The method is able to suggest the
periods where the economic collusion agreement is more likely to have occurred.

2.7. The Local Gaussian Correlation

In essence, cartels are unstable - since their participants, at any instant of time, may come to break the agreement,
which reduces their lifetime. This way, the observed eﬀect from the proﬁt margin ratio and the resale price variability
can occur in short-time intervals. In practice, an evaluation that considers only aggregate (or global) measure may
despise observations of a collusive behaviour for a short period of time, since the whole series was dominated by a
pattern of economic competition.

Thus, according to [1], a local correlation measure may be used to identify not only whether there are indications
of cartelization, but also periods when the cartel may have occurred. The authors, following [37], proposed a local
Gaussian correlation using local maximum likelihood to evaluate the Brazilian gasoline retail market. Speciﬁcally,
they propose to consider any random variables (X1, X2) with arbitrary bivariate density deﬁned by f (X) and locally set
in a neighborhood of x = (x1, x2) following a bivariate normal distribution for each observed point so as to minimize
the distance, in the same way as shown in [25]:

Kb(υ − x){Ψ(υ, Θ(x)) − log[Ψ(υ, Θ(x))] f (x)}2dυ

(6)
Equation (6) is the distance of Kullback-Leibler between f and Ψ(ν, Θ(x)) locally weighted. The term Kb(ν − x) =
2 (ν2 − x2)] is the product of kernels with bandwidth b = (b1, b2), and Ψ(ν, Θ(x)) is a
(b1b2)−1K[b−1

By maximizing the local log-likelihood function, for bivariate sample jointly independent and identically distributed
Xi = (X1,i, X2,i) and bandwidth b = (b1, b2), as presented in [37], we have the following equation for L(LGC)(X1, ..., Xn; Θb(x)):

(9)
On this matter, through equation (9), for K = {1, 2}, each point observed in the sample has local average (µk(x)),
local variance (σk(x)) and local correlation (ρ(x)). Thus, the choice of the optimum bandwidth is made by restricting
the variance of the parameters so as to be sized by (nb3
2)2. One
of the advantages of this estimator is its ﬂexibility in dealing with models whose correlation is nonlinear. Another
advantage is the fact that it does not require a normal distribution of the vector Xi = (X1i, X2i). Thus, it is possible to
apply the local Gaussian correlation approach to detect periods where the correlation between the resale price margin
series and the variability of fuel price in the market may be signalling the presence of collusion.

3. Results

To generate the results shown in this section, our sample period is formed by the log deviation of weekly gasoline
sales prices in DF, GO, RJ and SP, provided by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Bio-fuels
(ANP), from January 5, 2014 to December 24, 2017, for a total of 207 observations. The elaboration of the sample
plan is important to guarantee that the statistical inference process is credible. As pointed out by [40], to carry out a
statistical study by means of sampling, it is necessary to know the concept of probabilistic sampling plans, in which
all units of the population have a nonzero probability of belonging to the sample21, and that probability is calculable.

3.1. The Best Fitted MSGARCH Model

From Figure (1) it is possible to make a ﬁrst exploratory and descriptive analysis of the data. Note that the time
interval selected to adjust the MSGARCH model suggests two diﬀerent regimes. The ﬁrst is characterized by a low
volatility of the data. The second regime is identiﬁed as a period of greater dispersion and variability of the data. This
suggests that conditional variance is time-varying according to a regime-switching speciﬁcation.

3.1.1. Brasília

In order to capture this eﬀect, we exhaustively performed many estimations to ﬁt the best GARCH model to
describe the behaviour observed in the data. In this way, the model that identiﬁed more precisely the two regimes in
Brasília is the one with heterogeneous regime, i.e., each regime is characterized by a diﬀerent conditional volatility.
Thus, a GARCH variance speciﬁcation with a skewed22 Standardized t- Student (S .t−S tudent) distribution is assumed
in the ﬁrst regime and an ARCH variance speciﬁcation with a S.t-Student distribution is assumed in the second regime.
The model is given by the equation (10):

zt|(mt = k, It−1) ∼ S .t − S tudent(0, hk,t, ν, ξ),

hk=1,t ≡ α0,1 + α1,1z2
t−1

hk=2,t ≡ α0,2 + α1,2z2
t−1.

+ β1h1,t−1,

(10)

where k ∈ 1, 2.

21By doing so, the information obtained from the data can be generalized to the population, since the random selection guarantees its represen-
tativeness and allows us to control possible sample errors. In this sense, it is necessary to choose the best sampling plan for the case studied, as
this will have a great inﬂuence on the results obtained. However, since there is no precise description of the sample selection process adopted by
the agency responsible for data collection, we carefully inform the reader that we are aware of the possible limitations of the statistical estimations
made in this study.

3.1.2. Goiânia

The best extension of the MSGARCH model to describe the market behaviour in Goiânia is represented in equation
(11). We adjust an EGARCH model with skewed Generalized Error Distribution (SGED) for the ﬁrst regime (k = 1),
i.e., the one that suggests a collusive behaviour. The second regime (k = 2), which may indicate a competitive
behaviour, follows an ARCH model with skewed normal distribution (SNORM):

The best extension of the MSGARCH model to describe the market behaviour in São Paulo is represented in the
equation (13). We adjust an ARCH model for the ﬁrst regime (k = 1), i.e., the one that suggests a collusive behaviour.
The second regime (k = 2) follows an EGARCH model. A skewed Generalized Error Distribution (SGED) is assumed
in each regime:

zt|(mt = k, It−1) ∼ S GED(0, hk,t, ν),

where k ∈ 1, 2.

3.1.5. Comparison Between ML and MCMC Estimations

The ML and MCMC estimations for the cities selected in this article are available in the Appendix. In Table
(1), we summarize the information of the Transition Matrix and stable probabilities for ML and MCMC estimations.
Estimates suggest that the volatility behaviour is not homogeneous over the two regimes. In fact, from Figures (8)
and (9) in the Appendix, it is possible to see the heterogeneity in the conditional volatility of the two regimes. The
persistence of volatility also shows a diﬀerent behaviour between the regimes. Thus, in accordance with equations (10)
- (13), the ﬁrst regime has low unconditional volatility and low persistence of the volatility process. In a diﬀerent way,
the second regime presents high unconditional volatility and high persistence of the volatility process. In this sense,
regime one may be perceived as a cartel behaviour, while regime two may be perceived as a competitive behaviour.

Table 1: Transition Matrix and stable probabilities for ML and MCMC estimation.

As reported in [3], ML estimation may not be an easy task for MSGARCH-type models. The MCMC estimate cir-
cumvents some potential problems of the ML method, since the exploratory analysis of the joint posterior distribution
of the model parameters avoids the convergence to a local maximum - which is a common problem in ML approach.
The Bayesian framework has many advantages, such as the lower cost to obtain the exact distributions of non-linear
functions of the model parameters by simulations from the joint posterior distribution. For the Bayesian estimation of
the MSGARCH models, the MCMC adaptive sampler proposed by [41] was applied. In other words, this method is a
random-walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with coerced acceptance rate. A satisfactory performance was observed.
The outcomes are presented in Table (1). The smoothed probabilities of being in the second regime (k = 2), given by
P[mt = 2|IT ] for t = 1, ..., T, superimposed on the log-deviation of the gasoline sales price (top graph) is displayed in
Figure (2). The ﬁltered (annualized) conditional volatilities of the overall process corresponds to the bottom graph.

As expected, when the smoothed probability of being in a more competitive environment (regime 2) is approxi-
mately equal to one, the ﬁltered volatility of the process increases quite noticeably. It is also possible to observe that
the Markov chain23 evolves persistently over time and that, at the limit, as reported in Table (1), the probabilities of

being in the two distinct market environments are approximately 52% and 48% in Brasília. For the gasoline market in
Goiânia, the probability of being in the collusive or cartel market behaviour (regime 1) is about 86% and about 14%
in the second one (competitive market behaviour). The probability of observing a cartel behaviour at time t and of this
behaviour remaining at t + 1 is 96% and 99% for Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, respectively.

It is important to report that the database used to generate the results shown in Figure (2a) was extracted from a
case already analyzed and judged by CADE. In this sense, we can note that, since the ﬁrst quarter of 2016, when the
Brazilian antitrust authority condemned the practice of cartel in the gasoline retail market in Brasília, there has been
an evident regime change which was duly captured by the Bayesian MCMC estimate.

In addition, when we combine the information in Table (1) with the descriptive analysis of Figure (2), we can
understand that the Transition Matrix informs us that, if the gasoline market in Brasília is characterized as an anti-
competitive regime at a given time instant t, the probability that it continues in that environment in t + 1 is 90.85%. In
Goiânia, this probability is equal to 86.47%. This value, shown in the 1st row and 1st column of Transition Matrix,
can be used as a ﬁlter for signs of cartel formation.

(2c) and (2d), respectively. We observe that the model was eﬀective in diﬀerentiating the market behaviours according
to the volatility. Although these markets have not been evaluated and judged by CADE, our outcomes suggest strong
evidences that it has a cartel behaviour, once the smoothed probability of being in the second regime - that conﬁgures
a competitive market - is equal (or closer) to zero in most of the time period analyzed.

We observed that during the period that characterizes collusive market behaviour in Brasília, i.e., from early 2014
to early 2016, the MSGARCH model seems to overestimate the probability of regime reversal in some brief time
intervals, which suggests the need of a speciﬁc treatment in order to address these possible outliers and correct the
bias of the estimators. This same procedure was applied to the other cities analyzed in this article. It is important
to note that, as far as we are concerned, this literature is still in development and there are no studies applied to the
Brazilian gasoline retail market debating cartel formation as shown in this article.

3.2. Statistical Treatment for the Markovian-Switching Regimes

The purpose of the statistical treatment performed in this section is to identify precisely at what point in time there
was a statistically signiﬁcant regime change. This is therefore justiﬁed, as can be seen by the smoothed probability of
the city of Brasilia, available in Figure (2a). Due to the presence of some possible outliers, the procedure implemented
to ensure the robustness of the results is described as follows.
We apply a scale transformation to the smoothed probabilities so that the market be in a competitive environment
(Regime 2) in each city evaluated. In this sense, a new variable, Pk=2,t, is created and deﬁned with the purposes of
changing its scale of values, restricted to the interval (0, 1), for a set of values in the real line, R.
In this way, we can assume a Normal distribution for this new variable. More precisely, we use the transformation
wt = Φ−1(Pk=2,t), in which Φ−1 is the inverse of the cumulative of the standard Normal distribution. In sequence, a
model that establishes two regimes is formulated: an initial regime that goes to time instant represented by m, for
which wt follows a distribution N(µ1, σ2
1) and, after the change point, m, (to be estimated by the model), wt follows a
distribution N(µ2, σ2

2), characterizing the second regime.

In order to capture the moment of change in m, a Bayesian approach is used. By doing so, we formulate a priori
uniform discrete distribution. Thus, all the instants of time have the same a priori probability. In summary, the model
considered establishes that:

N(µ2, σ2

for

i ≤ m
i > m

To estimate the parameters of this model, we used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). More speciﬁcally, we
use the Gibbs sampler with steps from Metropolis Hastings to simulate the posterior distribution. In addition to the
model parameters, we also simulated a posteriori samples of ∆ = µ2 − µ1 to identify how distinct (heterogeneous) the
two regimes are and to assess whether there is actually a signiﬁcant regime change.

By Figure (3), we can have a better dimension of how the market behavior of the gasoline retail price in Brasilia
changes over time. In Figure (3a), we might infer that, from the week of 03/20/2016 onwards, with a high probability
(p(m) (cid:117) 1), there was a regime change captured by m in the market under analysis. Thus, when comparing the
diﬀerence between the means, µ2 − µ1, in Figure (3b), we can notice that these are quite diﬀerent.

This suggests, in fact, that there are two distinct market behaviors for the retail gasoline price in Brasilia. Figure
(3c) shows the number of interactions used for the simulation of the posterior distribution. In this way, we have a
more robust evidence that the oscillations observed before 2016 for the city of Brasilia, shown in Figure (2a), does
not characterize a change of market behavior for Brasília.

Figure 4: Statistical Treatment for the Markovian-Switching Regimes in GO.

By submitting the same evaluation to the city of Goiania, we see from Figure (4a) that there is a probability
p(m) (cid:117) 0.45 associated with a change of regime in the period that corresponds to the instant of time between the
weeks of 03/21/2015 and 04/25/2015. On the other hand, on Figure (4b), we see that the diﬀerence between µ2 − µ1
is not as expressive as that observed in Brasilia. Figure (4b), in turn, shows the interactions of the simulation process
used to obtain the posterior distribution.

For Rio de Janeiro, from Figure (5a), we see a possible regime change with probability p(m) (cid:117) 0.5 around week
09/21/2014. On the other hand, when we observe the diﬀerence between the averages, µ2 − µ1, through Figure (5b),
we infer that, given its small size, there may not be a signiﬁcant change in the gasoline retail price behavior in RJ.

Finally, when we give the same statistical treatment to the city of São Paulo, from Figure (6a), we see that the
probability of a change in price behavior between weeks 12/20/2014 and 01/07/2015 is given by p(m) (cid:117) 0.5. However,
with the result shown in Figure (6b), we see that µ2 − µ1 is practically unperceivable. Thus, it may not be possible to
state that the São Paulo market showed competitive market characteristics for the period under analysis.

Figure 7: The Local Gaussian Correlation outcomes for the weekly gasoline sales price between January 2014 and December 2017. The proﬁt
margin is equivalent to the resale price margin.

13

The Brazilian antitrust authority uses the correlation between the resale price margin and the variability of prices
for the fuel market as a signalling of collusive behaviour. In other words, the LGC approach suggests that local nega-
tive correlations that are persistent for three consecutive weeks and are below -0.80 might indicate a cartel agreement
in the gasoline sales market. Thus, for Brasília (DF), we observe some points where the local correlation is negatively
and persistently stronger. It is situated below the red line in Figure (7a), which indicates that the local correlation is
lower than the value of the pocket rule (-0.8). The persistence of this value corresponds to the period between July
and November of 2016, and between June and November of 2017. Figure (7b) presents the LGC results for Goiânia
(GO). We note some points below the red line in May of 2017.

Considering the results of the LGC approach for Rio de Janeiro, it is possible to note in Figure (7c) that in April
2017 the local correlation is negative and less than -0.8, suggesting a cartel behaviour. For São Paulo, although some
time interval in which the local correlation is lower than -0.8 has been observed, it does not show persistence during
the evaluated period. Therefore, for the city of São Paulo, as shown in Figure (7d) the result of the LGC approach
does not reject the condition that the gasoline retail market has competitive characteristics.

4. Conclusion

This paper analyzed the behaviour of the gasoline sales market in the cities of Brasília, Goiânia, Rio de Janeiro
and São Paulo. The ﬁrst approach was based on the Markov-Switching GARCH model. The results suggested that,
in each market, there are evidences of cartel behaviour. The accuracy of the model is partially validated by the data
analysis of Brasília, a city that has already been evaluated and judged by CADE due to the formation of Cartel in the
gasoline market. In addition, the MSGARCH model indicates that all the other markets evaluated should be better
investigated, since there is a substantial probability that it would have practiced cartel between 2014 and 2017.

The second approach was the Local Gaussian Correlation. The idea of adopting two models was to compare their
ﬁt quality to the data and to evaluate if they could be used in a complementary way. In this sense, even though the
Local Gaussian Correlation model indicated that the gasoline retail markets in Brasilia, Goiânia and Rio de Janeiro are
considerably more likely to have practiced cartels in the observed period, the dates in which this collusive behaviour
would have occurred did not match with the MS GARCH analysis.

In other words, for the Brasília gasoline retail market, the LGC model indicates cartel formation from July to
November 2016 and from June to November 2017. However, during this time, CADE had already judged and con-
demned the collusive practice in the gasoline market. Another result that aﬀects the accuracy of this model is the fact
that it did not identify the cartel period along the years 2014 and 2015, where the weekly price volatility was quite low.
Through the MS-GARCH models, it was possible to infer that the gasoline retail market in Goiânia, Rio de Janeiro
and São Paulo showed a behaviour that was persistently cartelized. On the other hand, by the LGC approach, the
same collusive behaviour was identiﬁed sporadically in Goiânia and Rio de Janeiro. The most striking result - and the
one that most prevents the dialogue between the applied methodologies - was the one observed for São Paulo, given
that, according to the methodology used by CADE, the gasoline retail market ﬁts the characteristics of a competitive
economic environment.

Finally, through this article, we hope to have emphasized the relevance of the analysis on price variation, which is
a strategic variable of the ﬁrms with regard to the decisions on whether to adhere to a collusive agreement or not. In
addition, it is important to recognize the limitation of the MSGARCH model with regard to the treatment of possible
outliers. Another issue that may limit the validity of our results is the quality of the sample available. Thus, for future
research, it may be useful to design a sample plan that guarantees the consistency of the estimators and also a way to
treat the outliers departing from a MCMC approach.
