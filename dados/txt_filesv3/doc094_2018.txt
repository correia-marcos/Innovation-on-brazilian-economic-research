Abstract 
 
The objective of this study is to analyze the determinants of Brazilian exports by levels of technological 
intensity in the period 2000-2015. Gravity  models were estimated for total of the exports and for each 
type of  exports by  levels of technological intensity, using the PPML-estimator developed by Silva and 
Tenreyro (2006). The results of this study indicate that it is a process of concentration of Brazilian exports 
in low technology and  medium-low technology products, at the same period in which China's share of 
total Brazilian shipments abroad grew. Estimates of empirical gravity models have shown that the income 
and size of the consumer market of Brazil's trading partners seem to have the greatest positive influence 
on  the  Brazilian  exports.  In  this  sense,  indications  of  this  study  are  that  the  Brazil  should  continue  to 
diversify its trading partners to minimize the impacts of a possible reduction of the economic growth of 
large trading partners (such as China and the US) on its exports and increase its exports of products with 
greater technological intensity. The results also  highlight the need for  Brazil to make  greater efforts to 
increase its competitiveness in the international market to reduce the negative impacts of transport costs 
on the final prices of products exported by the country.

Resumo 
 
O objetivo deste estudo é analisar os determinantes das exportações brasileiras por níveis de intensidade 
tecnológica no período 2000-2015. Foram estimados modelos gravitacionais para as exportações totais e 
para  cada  tipo  de  exportações  por  níveis  de  intensidade  tecnológica,  utilizando-se  o  estimador  Poisson 
Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood  (PPML),  desenvolvido  por  Silva  e  Tenreyro  (2006).  Os  principais 
resultados  do  trabalho  apontam  que  está  em  curso  um  processo  de  concentração  das  exportações 
brasileiras em produtos de baixa e média-baixa tecnologia, ao tempo em que tem crescido a participação 
da  China  no  total  dos  embarques  brasileiros  para  o  exterior.  As  estimações  dos  modelos  empíricos 
evidenciaram  que  a  renda  e  o  tamanho  do  mercado  consumidor  dos  parceiros  comerciais  do  Brasil 
parecem exercer as maiores influências positivas sobre as exportações do país. Nesta linha, as indicações 
são  de  que  o  país  deve  continuar  diversificando  seus  parceiros  comercias,  de  modo  a  minimizar  os 
impactos de uma possível redução do crescimento econômico de grandes parceiros comerciais (como a 
China e os EUA) sobre suas exportações e a aumentar suas exportações de produtos de maior intensidade 
tecnológica.  Os  resultados  do  trabalho  também  conferem  relevância  à  necessidade  de  o  Brasil  envidar 
maiores  esforços  para  aumentar  sua  competitividade  no  mercado  internacional,  de  modo  a  reduzir  os 
reflexos negativos dos custos de transportes sobre os preços finais dos produtos exportados pelo país.

1. Introduction 

 
The growth of Brazilian exports has been very uneven when analyzed in its levels of technological 
intensity.  In  recent  years,  exports  of  products  of lower  technological  intensity  have  grown  much  faster 
than  those  of  more  exports  of  technologically  intensive  products,  causing  significant  changes  in  the 
country's export agenda. 

This  disharmonious  movement  of  exports  in  levels  of  technological  intensity  may  generate 
undesirable long-term effects on the performance of the Brazilian trade  balance because the process of 
innovation and imitation creates a new configuration that can result in a redistribution of the trade flow 
between  countries  and  in  an  international  division  of  labor  (GUERRIERI,  1991)3.  Although  the 
conditions for its generation and diffusion are different for each economic activity, the new technologies 
lead  to  the  differentiation  of  products  and  increase  the  country's  international  competitiveness 
(BERNARD  et  al.,  2003;  MARQUES-RAMOS,  2007).  And  in  its  capacity  for  the  generation  and 
diffusion  of  new  technologies  lie  the  explanations  for  its  advantages  (comparative  and/or  absolute) 
acquired by many countries in the field of foreign trade and in its position in terms of the international 
standard of trade.  

In this sense, the changes in the Brazilian export agenda in recent years require new studies on the 
determinants of these exports with updated data, since the advantages acquired in foreign trade by firms 
or  countries  concerning  technological  issues  are  temporary,  lasting  only  enough  for  imitators  to 
incorporate  new  technical  skills  that  overcome  the  technological  gap  that  existed  in  their  productive 
processes (GUERRIERI, 1991). 

In Brazil case, in addition to the changes in levels of technological intensity of exported products, 
the  studied  period  (2000-20015)  captures  the  repositioning  of  China  between  the  trade  partners  of  the 
country,  overcoming  United  States  as  the  main  destination  of  Brazilian  products.  Moreover,  in  the 
Brazilian  literature  on  international  trade  although  some  empirical  research  has  been  made  by  using 
gravity equations none has focus on levels of technological intensity, just as it was done in this study4. 

In this sense, the objective of this study is to analyze the determinants of Brazilian exports in its 
levels of technological intensity in the period 2000-2015 with the use of gravity models. That is, the study 
seeks to explain the differentiated performance of Brazilian exports in its levels of technological intensity 
by means of gravity variables, such as market size, transport costs, customs tariffs, common borders and 
trade agreements. 

Gravity  models  were  estimated  for  total  exports  and  for  each  type  of  exports  in  the  level  of 
technological  intensity.  In  all  estimations,  we  used  the  Poisson  Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood  (PPML) 
estimator,  developed  by  Silva  and  Tenreyro  (2006).  This  method  has  proved  to  be  effective  in  the 
presence of heteroscedasticity, which makes estimations biased and inconsistent when gravity models are 
estimated by method that request linear transformation (SILVA; TENREYRO, 2006). 

The use of gravity models has become increasingly frequent in international trade studies, mainly 
because  of  its  empirical  applicability  and  its  flexible  structure,  which  favors  the  quantification  of  the 
effects  of  trade  with  great  foresight  in  a  realistic  gravity  environment,  with  multiple  countries,  several 
sectors  and  even  several  companies,  adapting  to  many  general  equilibrium  international  trade  theories 
(YOTOV; PIERMARTINI; MONTEIRO; LARCH, 2016). 

Initially criticized for having no theoretical basis, the gravity equations were applied in the bundle 
of  Ricardian  models  (EATON;  KORTUM,  2002,  HELPMAN;  MELITZ;  RUBINSTEIN,  2008)  in  the 
Heckscher-Ohlin structure (BERGSTRAND 1985 and 1989; DEARDORFF, 1995) and also in models of 
imperfect competition (HELPMAN; KRUGMAN, 1985; HELPMAN; MELITZ; RUBINSTEIN, 2008).  

To develop all these questions, this study has been divided into five sections. The first and the last 
sections concern the introduction and conclusion; the second section presents the microeconomic basis of 

                                                            
3  Not  coincidentally,  a  variable  was  inserted  in  the  models  estimated  in  this  study  that  seeks  to  capture  if  the  main  trade 
partners of the country in the analyzed period have or not patterns of income and technologies similar to those of Brazil. 
4  Castilho  (2001)  conducted  estimations  of  Brazilian  exports  using  the  two  and  four-digit  disaggregation  of  the  Standard 
International  Trade  Classification  (STIC)  and  Sarmento  (2012)  made  estimations  in  productive  stage  (primary  goods, 
intermediate goods and final goods), but without highlighting the issue of technological differences among exported products.

2. Gravity models for export determination 
 
2.1. The microeconomic fundamentals of gravity models  

Tinberg (1962), Poyhonen (1963) and Linnemann (1966) were the first to use the gravity model 
for  analysis  in  the  international  trade  theory  in  the  1960s.  As  we  know,  the  basic  equation  used  by 
Tinberg (1962) originates from the Law of Universal Gravitation by Isaac Newton, which states that the 
gravity  force  between  two  bodies  is  positively  attracted  by  the  product  of  their  masses  and  negatively 
influenced by the square distance between them, as shown in equation 1, below. 

 

 

(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3) = 	(cid:6) (cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:3)
(cid:9) 									(1) 
(cid:8)(cid:2)(cid:3)

From Equation (1), Fij is gravity force between bodies i and j; Mi indicates the mass of the body i; 
Mj  is  the  mass  of  the  body  j; (cid:8)(cid:9)ij  is  the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  bodies  i  and  j;  and  G  is  a 
constant. In Tinberg's equation (1962), the trade flow between two countries is directly related to the size 
of its markets (which has GDP as a proxy) and inverse to the distance between countries (parameter for 
transport costs). The equation (2), below, reproduces the equation of Tinberg (1962), where Xij indicates 
the value of exports between countries i and j; Y denotes the nominal GDP value; Dij is the geographic 
distance between countries i and j; k is a constant; α and β are parameters with positive signs and θ is a 
parameter with negative sign. The GDP is a proxy for the size of the economy of each country i and j and 
the proxy for transport costs is attributed to the geographical distance between these countries.  
 

 

(cid:13)(cid:2)(cid:3) = 	(cid:14)

(cid:17)
(cid:16)(cid:15)(cid:3)
(cid:15)(cid:2)
(cid:18) 									(2) 
(cid:8)(cid:2)(cid:3)

Over  time,  other  variables  were  incorporated  into  Equation  (2),  such  as  the  population  of 
countries, trade agreements, colonization relationship, common language, natural and artificial barriers to 
trade, borders and territorial contiguity.  

Despite its applicability, the gravity model initially suffered resistance because it did not have a 
solid theoretical basis. It was Anderson (1979) who elaborated the first theoretical basis for the gravity 
model, starting from the development of a gravity equation based on a demand function of imports with 
constant elasticity of substitution (CES), in which each country produces and sells differentiated products 
and, therefore, imperfect substitutes in the international market, impressing microeconomic foundations 
to the model. 

Subsequently, Bergstrand (1985) worked with a gravity equation that would be the reduced form 
of  a  partial  equilibrium  subsystem,  which  originates  from  a  general  equilibrium  model  of  international 
trade, with differentiated products for each country. The equation of the export demand for each country 
is obtained by maximizing a constant substitution elasticity function (CES) and the supply equation is the 
maximization of a profit function of the exporting company, based on a function of constant elasticity of 
transformation  (CET).  Bergstrand's  (1989)  study  is  an  extension  of  the  previous  one  (with  capital  and 
labor as factors of production, differentiated products and increasing returns of scale), with the expansion 
of the micro-foundations of the gravity equations under the Heckscher-Ohlin model.  

Helpman and Krugman (1985) have also given important theoretical support to the gravity model, 
establishing a scheme with differentiated products and scale economies, within the scope of monopolistic 
competition.  The  authors  have  imposed  a  framework  on  the  model  that  combines  characteristics  of 

 

3 

Theory of Comparative Advantage with imperfect competition. The old theory would be the reason for 
the inter-industrial trade and the new one of the intra-industry trade practiced by the countries. 

Deardorff  (1995)  developed  gravity  equations  with  Cobb-Douglas  and  CES  type  preferences  to 
show that these equations are consistent with the Heckscher-Ohlin model. The author worked with two 
extreme cases of bilateral trade (one without barriers and with homogeneous products and the other with 
barriers  and  differentiated  products)  seeking  to  find  a  general  result  that  supported  the  use  of  gravity 
equations to explain foreign trade due to differences in resource endowments between countries. 

Eaton  and  Kortum  (2002)  proposed  a  Ricardian  Model  of  International  Trade,  which  therefore 
incorporates  differences  in  technological  levels  between  countries  as  well  as  natural  and  artificial 
geographical  barriers.  The  gravity  model  employs  a  probabilistic  formulation  of  technological 
heterogeneity  (which  seeks  to  measure  the  comparative  advantages  of  each  country),  along  with  the 
geographical  barriers  that  inhibit  foreign  trade  in  the  context  of  a  general  equilibrium  analysis.  The 
specialization of countries in products where they have the greatest comparative advantage is determined 
not only by differences in productivity among them but also by the geographical barriers that determine 
the cost of international transport. 

Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) developed a gravity model in an attempt to solve the “border 
puzzle”, which indicates that borders reduce the level of exchange between countries. The study had as its 
starting point McCallum's (1995)5 model, in which bilateral trade between two countries depends on the 
production  of  both,  their  bilateral  distance  and  if  they  are  separated  by  a  border.  The  fundamental 
difference between Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) compared to McCallum's (1995) was the addition 
of some terms to correct the bias caused by the omission of variables in the gravity equation. These terms 
characterize  multilateral  trade  resistance  (the  name  given  to  all  variables  that  create  multilateral  trade 
barriers), such as exchange costs, the presence of trade barriers, and the distances between countries. An 
increase  in  multilateral  trade  resistance,  for  example,  between  country  j  and  its  other  trading  partners, 
other than country i, increases the latter's exports to j, given a particular trade barrier between these two 
countries. 

More recently, Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008) developed a model of international trade 
with heterogeneous firms. In the gravity model, the products are differentiated, the firms have fixed and 
variable export costs and their productivities are different. The profitability of exports varies, depending 
on their destination, being bigger when they go to countries with higher demand, for which the fixed and 
variable  costs  of  exports  are  lower.  Only  the  most  efficient  and  therefore  more  productive  firms  earn 
profits on exports. 

It is noticeable that over time there has been an evolution of theories in an attempt to adapt more 
and  more  to  the  reality  of  modern  economy.  The  gravity  models  were  provided  with  economic 
fundaments, which involved not only the traditional international trade theories (with Ricardian models 
and based on the Heckscher-Ohlin structure) but also in the New Trade Theory, incorporating variables to 
measure scale economies, product differentiation and heterogeneity of exporting companies in the context 
of imperfect competition. 

Based on this theoretical framework, gravity equations were estimated to verify the determinants 
of  trade  flow  of  several  countries.  This  was  the  case,  for  example,  of  Rahman  (2003)  for  Bangladesh; 
Sohn (2005) for South Korea; Batra (2006) for India; Marquez-Ramos (2007) for African countries; Eita 
(2008) for Namibia; Collins (2008) for the USA; Rahman (2009) for Australia; Hatab, Romstad and Huo 
(2010) for agricultural exports in Egypt; Binh, Duong and Cuong (2011) for Vietnam; Roy and Rayhan 
(2011) Bobkova' (2012) for Bangladesh; for the Czech Republic and for Germany Hippolyte (2012) for 
Barbados;  Iwasaki  and  Suganuma  (2013)  for  Russia;  Yeshineh  (2014)  for  Ethiopia;  Karamuriro  and 
Karukuza (2015) for Uganda; Spinelli and Miroudot (2015) for the OECD countries; Brodzicki (2015) for 
Poland;  Kahfi  (2016)  for  exports  of  manufactured  goods  in  Indonesia;  Dlamini,  et  al.  (2016)  for 

                                                            
5 The model of McCallum (1995) takes into account the export of country i to country j (dependent variable), GDP of country 
i, GDP of country  j, distance between countries  i and  j and an equal dummy variable 1 if there is interprovincial trade and 
equal 0 if trade is between an American state and a Canadian province.

Hussain (2017) for Pakistan. 

In  general, the gravity  models estimated in these studies depend on the  trade flow between two 
countries (exports plus imports) or exports from one country to another. The Main Independent Gravity 
Variables  (called  MIGV)  used  are  the  GDP  of  each  of  the  exporting  countries  and  of  the  importing 
countries,  the  distance  between  them  and  dummies  for  colonial  past,  common  language  and  contiguity 
(frontier).  The  country's  GDP  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  the  exports  offer  and  the  GDP  of  the  importing 
country  as  a  proxy  for  demand;  the  population  is  used  as  a  measurement  of  the  market  size  for  each 
country; the geographic distance is a proxy for the transportation cost; being aided by other trade barrier 
proxies, such as the colonial past, the common language and contiguity. The basic equation that reflects 
the use of these variables is the following: 

 

(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:13)(cid:2)(cid:3)= (cid:22)(cid:23) +	(cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:15)(cid:2) + (cid:22)(cid:25) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:15)(cid:3) + (cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:2) +	(cid:22)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:3) + 	(cid:22)(cid:29) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:8)(cid:2)(cid:3) +	(cid:22)(cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:2)(cid:3) +	 (cid:2)(cid:3)							(3) 

 
Where  i  is  the  exporting  country;  j  the  importing  country;  ln  is  the  natural  logarithm;  X  represents 
exports; Y the GDP; N the population; D the  geographic distance; Z is the dummies vector variable for 
colonial past, common language and contiguity;  (cid:2)(cid:3) is the error term. 

Regarding  the  estimation  of  gravity  models,  some  authors  opt  for  the  Ordinary  Least  Squares 
(OLS)  method,  mainly  due  to  the  simplicity  of  its  application,  but  the  effectiveness  of  this  method  is 
constantly questioned because of the bias of the estimators found6. An increasing number of papers have 
used  the  panel  data  technique7,  with  an  emphasis  on  fixed  effects  panels,  because  of  their  ability  to 
capture unobserved factors specific to each country that are constant over time. More recently, there have 
been methods that deal  with the absence of trade flow between  countries in a  given period (zero trade 
flows) and which are more robust in the presence of heteroscedasticity, which is common in the data used 
in gravity models. In this line, one of the most used methods is the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood 
(PPML) estimator8. 

We bring next the Brazilian empirical literature with the main studies that used gravity models in 

the estimations of models that also aimed to investigate the determinants of Brazilian foreign trade. 
 
 
2.2 The use of gravity models to explain trade determinants and the Brazilian empirical literature 

The Brazilian empirical literature that applied gravity equations to analyze the trade determinants 
is relatively recent. Initially, Piane and Kume (2000) used a gravity model to investigate the evolution of 
bilateral  flows  of  international  trade  among  44  countries,  in  order  to  capture  the  effects  of  preferential 
agreements of six economic blocks in the period between 1986 and 1997. 

Castilho  (2001)  sought  to  analyze  the  products  of  98  sectors  from  Mercosur9  to  verify  if  the 
exports of these sectors would be stimulated in the case of a bilateral liberalization between this economic 
block  the  European  Union  (EU)10.  Mercosur  was  also  the  target  in  Azevedo  (2004),  who  examined  its 
effects on intra-block trade and total exports and imports of the block in the period 1987-1998. Azevedo, 
Portugal and Barcellos Neto's (2006) study is similar to that of Azevedo (2004), including the variables

 Mercosur is a South American trade bloc established by the Treaty of Asunción in 1991 and Protocol of Ouro Preto in 1994. 
Its  full  members  are Argentina, Brazil, Paraguayand Uruguay. Venezuela is  a  full  member  but  has  been  suspended  since 
December 1, 2016. Associate countries are Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Suriname. 
10 The European Union (EU) has 28 member states that are located primarily in Europe, with estimated population of over 510 
million.

used,  except  that  instead  of  dealing  with  Mercosur,  he  investigated  the  effects  of  the  creation  of  the 
FTAA11 on the trade flow in a group of countries that would be part of this block. 

Porto and Canuto (2004) investigated the impact of Mercosur on the trade flow of the Brazilian 
macro-regions (Central-West, North, Northeast,  South and Southeast), having  as explained variable the 
total  exports  from  each  state  to  another  state  or  country.  Two  other  studies  also  used  state  exports  as 
explained variable: Daumal and Zignago (2005) sought to analyze the border effect on the exports of each 
Brazilian state and Pintor, Schneider and Porto (2017) had as research focus the state's total exports in 
Paraná, a state of southern Brazil. 

Salles  et  al.  (2011)  studied  the  determinants  of  Brazilian  cellulose  and  paper  exports  between 
1997 and 2005. These exports were also the explained variable used in the Pereira and Almeida (2015) 
model,  whose  objective  was  to  study  the  impacts  of  technical  measurements  on  the  sector's  exports  of 
cellulose and paper in Brazil. 

Sarmento (2012) examined the trade flows of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) 
in order to verify if the preferential agreements promoted between the member countries stimulate some 
articulation or productive integration among the different countries. Vianna (2014) used gravity models to 
verify  the  determinants  of  the  Brazilian  trade  flow  with  106  countries,  with  emphasis  on  the  “border 
puzzle”  analysis  (McCallum  Puzzle),  which  was  also  inserted  in  the  Brazilian  foreign  trade  model 
estimated by Prates and Pereira (2015). 

Cordeiro  and  Rodrigues  Jr  (2016)  studied  the  trade  creation  and  trade  diversion  caused  by 
Mercosur over the sectors of agriculture and industry in the 1990s. The trade creation and trade diversion 
were also the central concern of Miranda (2017), who evaluated the effects of Brazil's trade agreements 
with seven countries between 1981 and 2013. 

The  analysis  of  Table  1  evidence  that  the  most  commonly  used  estimation  methods  were  the 
Ordinary  Least  Squares  (OLS),  Pooled  OLS,  Fixed-effects  and  random-effects  models  and  the  Poisson 
Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood  (PPML)  estimator.  One  of  the  central  concerns  of  these  studies  was  the 
analysis of the effects of Mercosur  on the flow of foreign trade in  Brazil.  In fact, the impacts of  other 
economic  blocks  and/or  preferential  trade  agreements  on  the  Brazilian  trade  flow  seem  to  be  the 
fundamental motivation for the use of gravity models in Brazilian studies. In addition to Mercosur, the 
dummy  variables  were  included  for  ASEAN12,  LAIA,  BRICS13,  Andean  Community14,  FTAA  and  the 
EU. Among the studies in Table 1, only those of Daumal and Zignago (2005) and Salles et al. (2011) did 
not estimate models with explanatory variables related to economic blocks and preferential agreements. 

Furthermore,  most  of  the  aforementioned  studies  had  models  with  practically  all  the  main 
independent gravity variables (GDP of each of the exporting country and the importing country, distance 
between them and dummies for colonial past, common language and contiguity, group which was defined 
above as MIGV). In relation to the dependent variable, the predominance in the studies is the trade flow 
and bilateral trade (either in imports or exports), but there are more specific cases, such as that of Salles et 
al. (2011) and Pereira and Almeida (2015), who worked with paper and cellulose exports, and Castilho 
(2001), whose analysis rested on bilateral imports from 98 sectors from Mercosur to the EU. 

In this aspect, it should be noted that in none Brazilian study has the focus to examine the relation 
between the exports and the technological question, contrary to what happens in the present study, which 
intends to examine the determinants of Brazilian exports by intensity of technological intensity. Besides 
this, as will be seen in section 4, in studied period (2000-2015), China ended up taking place of US as the 
biggest  importer  of  Brazilian  products.  Although  it  does  not  raise  the  causes  of  this  fact,  this  study

3. Methodology 
 
3.1 Data sources 

All data used in the study refer to the period 2000-2015. The GDP per capita (in current US$) and 
population  (in  number  of  inhabitants)  are  based  on  the  World  Bank  Indicators;  the  distance  between 
Brazil and the main destinations of its exports refers to distances (in kilometers) between the capitals of 
these  countries,  raised  through  the  "Distance  between  Cities"  website,  which  presents  such  distances 
calculated  by  API  -  Application  Programming  Interface  Google  Maps;  the  borders  are  based  on  the 
Center  d'Etudes  Prospectives  et  d'Informations  Internationales  (CEPII)  database;  the  territory  of  each 
country  was  obtained  in  the  Channel  Countries  @,  from  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and 
7 

 

Statistics  -  IBGE;  and  the  trade  agreements  that  Brazil  signed  with  other  countries  were  raised  on  the 
website of the Brazilian Ministry of Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC). 

Exports refer to the value exported by Brazil to its fifteen trading partners. The definition of these 
countries was made by surveying the average share of each of them in total exports from Brazil in the 
period  2000-2015  and  its  result  presented  in  Table  5  (section  4).  The  disaggregated  export  data  were 
taken from the UN Commodity Trade Statistics (UN Comtrade). These exports were grouped according 
to the technological intensity of the products, followed by the methodology developed by the OECD15, 
which  divides  them  into  high  technology,  medium-high  technology,  medium-low  technology  and  low-
technology  products.  Table  2,  below,  details  the  products  that  fall  into  each  of  these  levels  of 
technological intensity.

3.2 The empirical model 

The gravity model estimated in this study is based on the gravity equation proposed by Anderson 

and van Wincoop (2003), as shown below: 

 

 

(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:13)(cid:2)(cid:3)= (cid:22)(cid:23) +	(cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:15)(cid:2) + (cid:22)(cid:25) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:15)(cid:3) + (cid:22)(cid:26) (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:8)(cid:2)(cid:3) +	(cid:22)(cid:28)"(cid:2)(cid:3) +	 (cid:2)(cid:3)							(4) 

From Equation (4), Xij is the exports s from i to j; Yi is the GDP for country i; Yj is the GDP for 
country j; Dij is the distance between country i and country j; and  δij is the dummies vector of variable 
representing  the  multilateral  trade  barriers.  Anderson  and  van  Wincoop  (2003)  worked  with  the 
consumption  function		(Σ	βi	(1-σ)/σcij(1-σ)/σ)	σ/(1-σ),  in  which  βi  is  a  parameter,  σ  >  1  is  a  constant 
substitution elasticity between different product types and cij is the consumption of products of region i in 
region  j.  This  equation  is  maximized  by  consumers,  who  are  subject  to  the  budget  constraint  given  by 
Σpijcij	=	Yj, where pij is the price of the product of region i sold in region j. This last equation ensures that 
the total spending of consumers in country j is equal to the total of their consumption of different goods 
coming from all countries, including j. Thus pij	=	pitij,	where pi is the price received by the exporter and tij 
is the bilateral cost of trade (cij) between countries i and j. Prices differ between different locations where 
a  product  is  marketed  because  of  external  trade  costs,  which  are  generally  not  directly  observed. 
Assuming that these costs are incorporated in the price received by the exporter, the nominal value of the 
exports is given by	xij = pijcij and the total nominal value of the trade in the region is given by (cid:15)(cid:2) = 01(cid:2)(cid:3). 	
The  nominal  demand  of  the  products  from  country  i  by  the  consumers  in  country  j  is:  (cid:13)(cid:2)(cid:3) =
3(cid:3) 5((cid:23)67) (cid:15)(cid:2)	, where 8(cid:3) =	90:(;<	=<	><:)(cid:23)67? @
2	(cid:17)(cid:2)3(cid:2)	4(cid:2)(cid:3)
@AB . We can find the equilibrium proposed by Anderson 
and  van  Wincoop  (2003),  and  we  arrive  at  the  gravity  equation  of  the  model  described  as,  (cid:13)< =

Regarding  the  variables  that  are  on  the  right  side  of  the  equation  (5),  the  GDP  per  capita 
((cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:8)88F4)  will  be  used  as  a  proxy  of  the  capacity  of  the  country  i  to  offer  and  of  the  country  j  to 
demand the exported goods. With a higher GDP per capita, the exporting country is expected to be more 
able to invest in innovations and infrastructure, becoming more productive and prone to export. On the 
side  of  importing  countries,  a  higher  GDP  per  capita  implies  a  higher  purchasing  power  and, 
consequently,  an  increase  in  their  demand  for  imports.  Therefore,  this  variable  is  expected  to  have  a 
positive coefficient. 

In the case of population ((cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:27)4), this variable could mean that the country’s market is large (or 
small),  with  positive  impact  (or  negative)  on  the  demand  for  goods  and  services.  The  growth  of  the 
population of the importator country can elevate Brazilian export, while the larger domestic population 
can reduce this exports, once low the export excess of the country17. Thus, this variable is expected have a 
positive coefficient of importator country population ((cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:3)4) and negative to population of Brazil ((cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:2)4).

 The value for dependent variable is taken without log in PPML- Estimator technique. 

17 From the point of view of the factors of production, the population coefficient can be positive or negative: positive if it is 
considered that a larger population makes it possible to increase the division of labor in the domestic economy, increasing its

The absolute difference between the exporting country GDP per capita and the importing country 
GDP  per  capita  ((cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:8)H(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:8)88F(cid:2)(cid:3)4)  has  been  added  to  the  gravity  model  as  a  proxy  for  the  differential 
development between these two countries and is used to try to identify trade patterns and also to measure 
the  economic  and  technological  inequalities  between  countries  engaged  in  foreign  trade18.  Their 
coefficient  can  be  positive  or  negative,  depending  on  two  basic  hypotheses:  the  first  is  Linder's 
hypothesis, according to which countries with similar per capita income patterns have similar tastes and 
preferences,  stimulating  intra-industry  trade  among  them,  based  on  the  exchanges  of  differentiated 
products19. The second is the Heckscher-Ohlin hypothesis, which assumes that the greater the difference 
between  countries'  per  capita  incomes,  the  greater  will  be  the  differences  between  their  productive 
resource  endowments,  stimulating  productive  specialization  between  them  and  interindustrial  trade;  on 
the other hand, a smaller difference between those incomes would lead to a reduction in foreign trade, 
unlike Linder's hypothesis. In this line, the negative sign of the coefficient of absolute difference between 
the GDP per capita supports the Linder hypothesis, whereas the positive one bases the Heckscher-Ohlin 
hypothesis. 

Regarding  the  geographical  distance  between  the  exporting  country  and  the  importing  country 
((cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:8)HJK(cid:2)(cid:3)),  this  variable  concerns  a  proxy  for  the  cost  of  transport  between  these  two  countries.  The 
greater the distance, the higher the transportation cost, which raises the price of a good in the importing 
country, thus reducing its demand. Therefore, the distance coefficient must be negative.  

One of the problems associated with the use of geographic distance between countries as a proxy 
for transport costs is that trade between countries with large economies can sometimes distort the results 
of this variable20. Considering the significant participation of large economies such as China and the US 
in total Brazilian exports, the relative distance ((cid:20)(cid:21)MEN(cid:8)HJK(cid:2)(cid:3)4) was added in the model estimated in this 
study. The formula used to calculate this variable was suggested by Head and Mayer (2014). For these 
authors,  this  variable  is  also  a  good  proxy  for  multilateral  resistance,  proposed  by  Anderson  and  van 
Wincoop (2003), but it is not directly observable21. Like for the geographical distance, the negative sign is 
expected for the relative distance. 

The  tariffs  applied  by  countries  to  imported  products  ((cid:20)(cid:21)KPMH(cid:1)(cid:3)4)  are  barriers  that  hinder 
international trade. The higher the tariff, the lower the import level of the country that applies it and vice 
versa. It is, therefore, a variable whose expected sign for the coefficient is negative. 

The  coefficient  of  the  territorial  area  ((cid:20)(cid:21)KEMM(cid:3))  of  the  countries  is  also  expected  to  have  a 
negative sign. This variable is used in gravity models as a proxy for the availability of natural resources in 
the country. It is reasonable to assume that a country with a large territorial area has less need to import 
natural resource-intensive goods than another country with a small territorial area. 

The dummy variable border (TUM(cid:8)EM(cid:2)(cid:3)), on the other hand, is expected to have a positive sign. A 
common geographical border increases bilateral trade, facilitating access for consumers and businesses to 
goods and services across the border and reducing the cost of transportation. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
foreign trade opportunities; and negative if a high population is considered to have a large labor supply capable of producing a 
wide range of goods internally and reducing their propensity for international trade. 
18  Two  hypotheses  were  tesded  in  Batra  (2006);  Rahman  (2003  and  2009);  Wang  and  Badman  (2016);  Karamuriro  and 
Karukuza (2015). 
19  Linder  (1961)  presupposes  that  the  similarity  of  income  between  countries  leads  to  internal  demands  with  approximate 
structures and that the presence of increasing returns of scale makes each of these countries specialize in the production of a 
good. This hypothesis was revisited in Chow and Yochanan (1999) and in Choi (2002) with results that corroborated it. 
20 See Polak (1996). 

21

 As a proxy for this variable, Feenstra (2003) proposes the use of fixed effects for exporters and importers for cross section 
estimates, while Olivero and Yotov (2012) suggest the exporter-year and importer-year form for estimates made by the data 
method on panel. In other works, such as those of Wei (1996) and Helliwell (1998), the multilateral resistance is presented as 
the geographic distance between the countries i and j and each of its commercial partners, weighted by the share of GDP of 
these  countries  on  world  GDP.  Head  (2003)  and  Head  and  Mayer  (2014)  suggest  that  this  latter  form  of  approach  to 
multilateral resistance be changed by dividing its result by unity so as to prevent its value from becoming too large in the case 
of many countries distant geographically and with small economies.

Brazil is a signatory of trade agreements through which tariff preferences are applied to several of 
its exports. When countries form a trade agreement, they not only apply lower tariffs but also cooperate in 
a number of other areas with policies that reduce the overall costs of their bilateral trade and remove other 
trade barriers besides tariffs. The coefficient of the dummy KMP(cid:8)EP(cid:6)ME(cid:2)(cid:3)	variable is therefore expected 
to be positive, in order to illustrate the importance of these arrangements for domestic exports. 

In order to capture the effect of the international financial crisis on Brazilian exports in the period 
analyzed in the study, two dummy variables were inserted, one for 2007 (FMHJHJ2007) and another one 
for 2008 (FMHJHJ2008), both with a negative expected sign. 

Regarding  the  explanatory  variable,  the  model  presented  in  this  study  (Equation  5)  will  be 
estimated  for  total  exports,  exports  of  high  technology  goods,  exports  of  medium-high  technology, 
exports  of  medium-low  technology  and  exports  of  low  technology,  as  presented  by  the  OECD  export 
disaggregation methodology. 

 
 

3.3 Estimation strategy 

The  estimates  of  the  empirical  model  proposed  in  this  study  will  be  performed  by  the  Poisson 
Pseudob-Maximum-Likelihood (PPML) estimator. This estimator was developed by Silva and Tenreyro 
(2006)  use  of  the  level  of  trade  flow  (rather  than  log  of  trade  flows)  as  a  left-hand  side  variable  also 
permits  to  keep  the zeroes  in  regressions  and  to correct  heteroscedasticity  problems,  which  are  usually 
found in the series used in gravity models. Silva and Tenreyro (2006) point out that, in the presence of 
heteroscedasticity,  the  model  estimates  in  the  logarithm  form  are  severely  biased,  distorting 
interpretations  of  their  results.  The  authors  indicate  that  a  resolution  for  this  problem  is  replacing  log-
linearized estimator with a multiplicative form.  

Silva and Tenreyro (2006) carried out Monte Carlo simulations to defend the idea that the PPML 
estimator is consistent to estimate gravity models, with robust empirical results taking into account not 
only basic models such as those introduced by Tinbergen (1962), but also those that rely on a multilateral 
resistance  proxy  in  the  gravity  equation,  replicating  the  idea  that  was  developed  by  Anderson  and  van 
Wincoop (2003). 

Yotov  et  al.  (2016)  summarize  the  reasons  for  the  use  of  the  PPML  estimator  space  in  the 
estimations of gravity models: i) it can be applied in a gravity equation in its multiplicative form, with the 
elimination  of  possible  inconsistencies  caused  by  heteroscedasticity;  ii)  it  deals  effectively  with  the 
presence of null values in trade flows; iii) its additive property ensures that the fixed effects of its gravity 
equation are identical to the corresponding structural terms; and iv) it can be used to calculate the effects 
of trade policies consistent with general equilibrium theories. 

Head  and  Mayer  (2014)  also  performed  Monte  Carlo  simulations  that  indicated  that  there  are 
important components of robustness in the PPML estimator. In this same line, Bobkova´ (2012) carried 
out  a  study  to  analyze  the  efficiency  of  the  estimation  of  gravity  models  based  on  logarithmic 
transformations and recommended the use of this estimator. 

 

 
4. Results  

 
All  exports  were  analyzed  in  the  light  of  the  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and 
Development (OECD)  methodology for disaggregating these exports22 .  Considering this methodology, 
we can see that, between 2000 and 2015, Brazilian low-tech exports grew 316.87% and medium-low-tech 
exports grew 289.87%. These results boosted the country's total exports, whose growth in the period was 
244.87%,  well  above  the  advances  in  high  technology  and  medium-high  technology  exports  that  were, 
respectively, 48.23% and 151.64 % (TABLE 3).

As a result, the Brazilian export agenda underwent significant changes in the period 2000-2015, 
with an increase in the participation of low and medium-low technology products and a reduction in the 
share  of  high  and  medium-high  technology  products  in  the  total  exports of  the  country.  The  combined 
share of the latter types  of products fell from 34.15% in 2000 to 22.63% in 2015, while the combined 
share for the first two types increased from 65.85% to 77.37% in the same period (TABLE 4).

As Table 5 shows, countries such as Argentina and the US have remained important destinations 
for shipments of Brazilian products abroad, but the main highlight in the period analyzed in the study was 
China, which surpassed the US as the largest importer of Brazilian products. In the first year of the 2000s, 
Brazil  sent  to  Argentina  and  the  United  States,  respectively,  11.39%  and  23.84%  of  its  total  exports, 
while China's share in this total was only 1.98%; in 2010, China had already become the main market for 
Brazilian exports with 15.37% while the US and Argentina shares were 9.51% and 9.21%; in 2015, the 
US participation increased slightly to 12.71%, but Argentina's share fell to 6.78% and was China further 
consolidated in the first position, being responsible for 18.86% of the total exports.

It is interesting to note that the Asian country gained participation in almost all levels of exports 
by  technological  intensity,  but  the  process  was  more  accentuated  for  exports  of  lower  technology.  By 
2015, China's share of total exports of low-tech was 9.0 times higher than it was in 2000; of medium-low 
technology 8.2 times; high-tech technology 6.8 times; of medium-high technology 5.5 times (TABLE 5). 
Regarding the results of the estimations, all models presented have high R² adjustment. The lowest 
one was verified in the estimation of the low technology export equation, for which 60.34% of the export 
variation is explained by the independent variables included in the model (TABLE 6). In the estimations 
of total exports, high technology, medium-high technology, and medium-low technology, the independent 
variables explain, respectively, 79.10%, 90.16%, 91.26% and 84.18% of the change in exports.

With regard to the coefficients of the explained variables, we highlight the significant impact that 
the GDP per capita of the importing countries (lnGDPPCjt) has on all the analyzed types of exports. The 
coefficients  of  this  variable  come  with  expected  signs,  with  statistical  significance  in  all  the  estimated 
models. This variable was the one that had the greatest positive impact in practically all types of exports 
analyzed, except for exports of high technology products, whose greatest positive impact came from the 
population of the importing country. For the total exports, the elasticity found was 8.02 and for the export 
equations  by  technological  intensity,  the  two  largest  ones  were  the  exports  of  medium-low  technology 
and medium-high technology, with elasticities of 13.54 and 13.48 (TABLE 6). 

Brazil's GDP per capita (lnGDPPCit) had statistically significant results only for total exports and 
for  exports  of  medium-high  technology.  As  can  be  seen  from  Table  6,  the  signs  presented  by  the 
coefficients of this variable were negative, contrary to what was expected. These results may be derived 
from the relatively low growth rates that have been observed in Brazil over the period analyzed, taking 
into  account  that  the  GDP  per  capita  of  the  exporting  country  is  a  proxy  for  its  ability  to  invest  and 
increase its export capacity. 

The population of the importing country (lnNjt) did not have a statistically significant result only in 
the case of exports of low technology products. For all others, the estimated coefficient was of relevant 
magnitude and presented the expected sign. As already mentioned, this variable is a proxy for the size of 
the importing country's market, from which a positive impact on exports is expected. As with the GDP 
per capita variable, the elasticities of medium-low technology and medium-high technology exports were 
the highest among those estimated in the study. 

Together, GDP per capita and population show the extent of the positive impact of the importing 
country's  consumer  market  on  Brazilian  exports.  In  this  line,  the  US  and  China  should  be  specially 
mentioned, since they are the two largest destinations for Brazilian exports. Data from the World Bank 
Indicators show that these two countries had the first and third largest populations in the world in 201523 . 
The same data show that, among the OECD countries, the USA is the one that owns the fifth largest GDP 
per capita - behind only Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland and Ireland - and that China has presented the 
highest  growth  rate  of  this  variable  among  the  countries  with  the  largest  share  of  world  GDP,  with  a 
geometric growth rate of 13, 61% between 2000 and 201524. 

In  relation to the population of the exporting country  (lnNit), all the results found were of  great 
magnitude and only the one related to exports of low technology products is not statistically significant. 
All these results had coefficient with a negative sign. One possible explanation for this result is that the 
size of the Brazilian population can reduce the country's exportable surplus, generating a negative impact 
on its exports. 

The results found for the absolute difference between the GDP per capita of the exporting country 
and  the  GDP  per  capita  of  the  importing  country  (lnDIFGDPPCijt)  were  statistically  significant  in  the 
estimations  of  models  for  total  exports,  high  technology  exports  and  low  technology  exports.  For  total 
exports  and  for  low-tech  exports,  the  results  suggest  that  Brazil  has  been  exporting  predominantly  to 
countries  with  similar  patterns  of  income  and  technological  development,  which  may  stimulate  intra-
industry trade, as is assumed by the Linder hypothesis. For exports of high technology products, the result 
found indicates that there is a trade in the Heckscher-Ohlin standard under which they would be subjected 
to. One possible explanation for this latter result is the significant weight the US has in total Brazilian 
exports of high technology products. As Table 5 shows, the US was the main destination for Brazilian 
shipments of this type of product over the period analyzed. 

In  relation to the population of the exporting country  (lnNit), all the results found were of  great 
magnitude and only the one related to exports of low technology products is not statistically significant. 
All these results had coefficient with a negative sign25. One possible explanation for this result is that the 

                                                            
23 The population of China in 2015 was 1.371 million people and the US population was 320.8 million. The second largest 
population  in  the  world  was  India,  with  1.309  million  inhabitants.  Data  from  the  World  Bank  Indicators  are  available  at 
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator. 
24 See World Bank Indicators.

 The negative sign for this variable was also found by Azevedo, Portugal and Barcellos Neto (2006); Cordeiro and Rodrigues 

Jr (2016); and Miranda (2017).

size of the Brazilian population can reduce the country's exportable surplus, generating a negative impact 
on its exports26. 

The results found for the absolute difference between the GDP per capita of the exporting country 
and  the  GDP  per  capita  of  the  importing  country  (lnDIFGDPPCijt)  were  statistically  significant  in  the 
estimations  of  models  for  total  exports,  high  technology  exports  and  low  technology  exports.  For  total 
exports  and  for  low-tech  exports,  the  results  suggest  that  Brazil  has  been  exporting  predominantly  to 
countries  with  similar  patterns  of  income  and  technological  development,  which  may  stimulate  intra-
industry  trade,  as  is  assumed  by  the  Linder  hypothesis27.  For  exports  of  high  technology  products,  the 
result found indicates that there is a trade in the Heckscher-Ohlin standard under which they would be 
subjected to. One possible explanation for this latter result is the significant weight the US has in total 
Brazilian exports of high technology products.  As Table 5 shows, the US was the main destination for 
Brazilian shipments of this type of product over the period analyzed. 

In the case of the absolute distance between Brazil and the destinations of its exports ((cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:8)HJK(cid:2)(cid:3)), 
only the result of the export model of low technology products did not present statistical significance. As 
for  the  relative  distance  ((cid:20)(cid:21)MEN(cid:8)HJK(cid:2)(cid:3)4),  there  was  not  a  statistical  significance  only  for  the  models 
referring to exports of high technology and low technology products. In general, the results we found are 
in agreement with the one assumed by the gravity models, indicating that the transport cost has a relevant 
negative impact on exports. The higher the cost of transportation, the higher the final price of products for 
consumers living in importing countries and the lower the volume exported by Brazil. Out of the products 
exported by  the  country, the ones that seem to be most sensitive to the variation of transport  costs are 
those of medium-high technology and medium-low technology, among which are included, for example, 
transport  equipment,  machinery  and  mechanical  equipment,  iron  ore,  petroleum,  iron,  steel  and  non-
ferrous minerals.  

The  tariffs  (lnTARIFijt)  only  had  significant  results  for  the  models  related  to  medium-high 
technology  exports  and  low  technology  exports,  but  the  signs  for  the  elasticities  were  not  the  ones  we 
expected. Similarly, the territorial area variable (lnTERRj) had significant results for total exports and for 
exports of low technology products, but also did not show the expected signs.  

On  the  other  hand,  the  results  of  the  frontier  variable  (BORDERij)  had  coefficients  with  the 
expected signs and presented statistical significance (except for the exports of products of medium-high 
technology  products)  indicating  that  the  proximity  of  Brazil  with  its  trading  partners  is  important  to 
stimulate  its  exports,  be  it  because  of  the  smaller  geographic  distance,  or  even  the  greater  ease  of 
communication and/or other factors that facilitate the access of importers to Brazilian products.  

Trade agreements (KMP(cid:8)EP(cid:6)MEij) also appear to be important in stimulating Brazilian exports, 
especially those with greater technological intensity, whose elasticities showed an expected sign and were 
larger than the unity. The results of this variable for total exports (without statistical significance) and for 
low-tech exports (with coefficient with different sign than expected) appear to have been more influenced 
by China and the US, which are Brazil's two largest trading partners and do not have any kind of trade 
agreement with the country. 

Regarding  the  dummies  variables  that  represent  the  international  financial  crisis  of  2007/2008 
(CRISIS2007  and  CRISIS2008),  the  results  indicate  that  the  total  Brazilian  exports  were  negatively 
impacted by the aforementioned crisis in 2007, these results did not present statistical significance for the 
year of 2008. Exports of medium-high and medium-low-tech products had a negative impact caused by 
the crisis in 2007 and 2008, while the results of high technology and low technology exports were not 
significant in either of these two years. 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                            
26 By 2015, Brazil had the fifth largest population in the world, according to World Bank Indicators. 
27 A similar result for Brazil's total exports was found by Sarmento (2012).

5. Conclusion 

 
The  analysis  of  exports  by  levels  of  technological  intensity  suggests  that  there  is  a  process  of 
increasing  concentration  of  Brazilian  exports  in  low  technology  and  medium-low  technology  products. 
These exports showed much higher growth than those of high technology and medium-high technology in 
the period analyzed in this study. 

At  the  same  time,  China  has  increased  its  share  of  total  Brazilian  shipments  abroad,  especially 
those related to low-technology and medium-low technology products. This movement gives indications 
that  the  increase  of  Brazilian  exports  to  China  has  to  do  with  the  concentration  of  these  exports  in 
products of lower technological intensity. 

The  results  of  the  estimations  showed  that  the  variables  of  income  and  size  of  the  consumer 
market of Brazil's trading partners seem to have the greatest positive influences on the country's exports. 
This signs two important aspects: the first is that one way to further increase Brazilian exports would be 
to  seek  preferential  trade  agreements  with  countries  with  potentially  high  consumer  markets,  such  as 
China, the US and the European Union; in this sense, the results of the absolute difference between the 
GDP  per  capita  of  the  exporting  country  and  the  GDP  per  capita  of  the  importing  country  variable 
(lnDIFGDPPCijt)  and  the  trade  agreements  variable  (KMP(cid:8)EP(cid:6)MEij)  suggest  such  initiatives  may 
contribute  to  increase  Brazilian  exports  of  products  with  greater  technological  intensity.  The  second 
aspect concerns the importance of Brazil continuing to diversify its trading partners in order to minimize 
the impacts of a possible reduction in the economic growth of large trading partners (such as China and 
the  US)  on  its  exports.  Again,  the  variables  lnDIFGDPPCijt  e KMP(cid:8)EP(cid:6)MEij  become  relevant  as  they 
give evidence that Brazil can increase its exports through the conclusion of preferential trade agreements 
with  countries  with  levels  of  income  and  technological  development  similar  to  its  own,  in  addition  to 
reducing the concentration of these exports in a relatively small group of trading partners, that movement 
can contribute to stimulate the exports of high-tech and medium-high technology as well. 

 The negative impacts of the international financial crisis on Brazilian exports also suggest that the 
country should have as one of its goals in the external scenario the diversification of markets for these 
exports. This measure can act as a counterpoint to international crises, bearing in mind that the impact of 
these crises hardly affects all countries. 

The negative coefficients of the absolute distance and relative distance gravity variables ((cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:8)HJK(cid:2)(cid:3) 
and  (cid:20)(cid:21)MEN(cid:8)HJK(cid:2)(cid:3)4)  and  the  positive  ones  of  that  which  determines  the  effects  of  the  existence  of  a 
common  border  between  Brazil  and  the  importers  of  its  products  (BORDERij)  give  relevance  to  the 
transport costs in the explanation of Brazilian exports. These results highlight the need for the country to 
make efforts to increase its competitiveness in the international market, since transport costs have a direct 
impact  on  the  final  prices  of  the  country's  products  adding  to  that  the  consumers  residing  in  the 
destination countries of its exports. Microeconomic measures that increase the productivity of the country 
are  welcome  to  increase  the  country's  competitiveness  in  both  the  domestic  and  the  external  scenario. 
Judging  from  the  performance  of  exports  of  products  with  a  higher  technological  intensity  vis-à-vis 
products with a lower technological intensity, it is also proposed that any measures to stimulate exports 
should be associated with others that stimulate process and product innovations in the country. 

This may end up generating a virtuous cycle, since these measures can contribute to increase the 
intra-industry trade between Brazil and other trading partners that have development patterns similar to its 
own,  further  stimulating  the  innovations  and  increasing  the  participation  of  the  products  of  greater 
technological intensity in the total exported by the country.
