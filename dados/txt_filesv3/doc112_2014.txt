Abstract

This study investigates three important issues related to student performance in the Program
for International Student Assessment PISA 2012. First, we estimate the intergenerational trans-
mission of education. Second, we verify whether circumstance variables inﬂuence effort variables
in the PISA. Third, we carry out a counterfactual analysis of the improvement in the socioeco-
nomic background of parents of those students who took the test. Results showed poor parental
transmission of education in South American countries. Speciﬁcally, in Brazil, the rate is seven
times lower than that of the Czech Republic and 20% of the total observed in France and in Japan.
In addition, there are signiﬁcantly positive effects of circumstances on individual effort. More-
over, the average gap for parental education hovers around 8%. About 2% of that is explained by
the difference in parental education in the distribution.

Introduction

There is a consensus agreement that good-quality education is a strong indicator of welfare. There-
fore, unequal education across regions, countries, and continents has been the target and subject of
several public policies. Along this line of thought, Daude (2011) advocates that access to good-quality
education is a powerful tool for the promotion of individual welfare, but certain conditions must be
met for that to occur. For instance, all individuals need to have access to a homogenous good-quality
education, regardless of their set of opportunities. Moreover, society has to acknowledge the im-
portance of merit so that talent and individual skills prevail. Without these guarantees, the returns
of investments in education are dissatisfactory, mainly for the most vulnerable ones in the society,
thereby reducing intergeneration mobility.

In other words, education is deemed to be a key element for the economic and social development
of any society. A qualiﬁed labor force increases the productivity of economic activities, allowing
for large growth of sectors and making the absorption of technology and innovation easier. Besides
these aspects, education is also essential for the good exercise of democracy, encouraging people to
vigorously enforce their rights and duties as citizens.

Nevertheless, the 2005 report of the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc, and Cultural Orga-
nization (UNESCO) stresses that, despite the growing consensus over the importance of quality of
education, the number of actions related to this concept is a lot smaller, actually. According to the
report, two principles often make a distinction about the ways used to deﬁne quality of education. The
ﬁrst one regards the cognitive development of students as the major explicit goal of any educational
system, endorsing their success as an indicative sign of its quality. The second one underscores the
role of education in the promotion of shared values and in creative and emotional development. In
this case, the achievement of these goals is way more complex to analyze.

Based on these concepts, social scientists such as Niknami (2010), Ferreira and Veloso (2003),
Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2005) have recently investigated the intergenerational transmission
of education. However, research results are few and far between and also inconclusive. In addition,
most studies use educational attainment years of schooling instead of educational performance.
Notwithstanding, results suggest a low level of transmission, chieﬂy in developing countries. These
results contribute towards the intergenerational persistence of education and also towards a broader
gap in inequality of educational opportunities.

However, numerous factors may be accountable for the low level of educational transmission,
especially the assumption of poor quality of education in those countries. Even though schooling
has improved in those economies in the past few years, educational attainment does not necessarily
mean having equal opportunities, as years of schooling do not reﬂect the quality of education of a
system, due basically to the existing heterogeneity of schools in their respective regions, countries,
and continents.1

That being said, understanding the underlying mechanisms in this relationship intergenerational
transmission of education is of utmost importance. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to
investigate three important issues. First, the process of intergenerational transmission of education in
the Program for International Student Assessment PISA associated with the theory of equal educa-
tional opportunities.2 To do that, we use the educational production function proposed by Hanuschek
(1970,1979), with some peculiarities. Second, the analysis of whether circumstances have an impact
on effort variables in PISA performance. In this context, we adopt the same approach developed by
Bourguignon, Ferreira and Menendez (2007), adapted here to the context of educational opportuni-
ties. Third, we perform a counterfactual analysis based on the socioeconomic level improvement of
the parents of those students who took part in PISA 2012. To do that, we used the counterfactual

2For example, Ferreira and Gignoux, (2011).

inference method developed by Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val and Melly (2013).

Note that there are major differences in this study. First, we checked the pattern of intergeneratio-
nal transmission of education between the economies submitted to PISA 2012. Second, we decompo-
sed the circumstance effects (both direct and indirect) on the performance in the assessment. Third,
we simulated the counterfactual effect of possible public educational policies. Finally, the paper is
organized as follows. Aside from this introduction, Section 2 provides a brief review on transmission
and inequality of educational opportunities, focusing mainly on studies that use PISA data. Section
3 explains the methodology used, including the description and analysis of data. Section 4 describes
the results. In the last section we make some remarks about the results.

2 Literature Review

This section introduces some studies on the topic. It initially highlights the study of Black, Devereux
and Salvanes (2005). The authors investigate why better-educated parents have better educated chil-
dren. According to their study, there are several possible explanations. However, two of them stand
out. First is the case of pure selection or indirect effects. That is, better-educated parents earn higher
salaries and, therefore, some variables contribute substantially to the education of their children. For
example, enrolling their children in the best schools, buying them the best books, and investing in
mechanisms that help them with learning. Second, the so-called causality or direct effect. In this
case, having access to better education makes one a better parent, thus predisposing ones children
to better educational outcomes. This direct relationship of causality occurs by means of potentially
unobservable factors, such as shared environments and genetic inheritance.

On the other hand, according to Roemer (1998), two concepts of equal opportunities prevail nowa-
days in western democracies. The ﬁrst one advocates that every individual with relevant potential in
his/her learning period ought to be accepted as a possible candidate in the competition for positions in
society. The second one, known as non-discrimination principle, establishes that in the competition
for positions in society every individual who has relevant attributes for a given job should be included
as an eligible candidate who will only be assessed based on relevant characteristics.

In the same vein, Lefranc, Pistolesi and Trannoy (2009) advocate that equal opportunities cons-
titute a basic principle for the reduction of inequalities between individuals. Results then depend on
a set of relevant deterministic and random factors for the economic agents success or failure. To
analyze equality of opportunities, it is necessary to identify the variables individuals are and are not
accountable for.

Nevertheless, there exist a large number of studies on the determinants of educational perfor-
mance, which use educational success data, but most of them are just descriptive studies. For ins-
tance, Aguirreche (2012) looks into how the level of unequal opportunities of a nation affects the
average performance of its students. A structural model based on Fleurbaey and Schokkaert (2009)
was used. Results point out a high level of unequal opportunities, i.e., more than 30% of unfair ine-
quality. In addition, there is a negative ratio of (-0.69) between unequal opportunities and educational
performance.

In another study, which included PISA data for 2006-2009, Gamboa and Waltenberg (2012) as-
sess unequal educational opportunities in six Latin American countries. To do that, they use the
nonparametric approach proposed by Checci and Peragine (2010) to decompose an inequality index.
The study demonstrates that unequal educational opportunities range from 1% to 25%, which denotes
considerable heterogeneity across the six countries.

Likewise, Ferreira and Gignoux (2008) use PISA data for 2000 and calculate the level of inequa-
lity observed in educational performance, which is determined by the set of opportunities. In brief,
the highest levels of unequal educational opportunities are reported for developing countries Latin
America although there is considerable heterogeneity across developed countries. The weight of

3

circumstance variables in total educational inequality varies between 9% and 30% on math tests and
between 14% and 33% on the reading test.

In another study, Ferreira and Gignoux (2011) propose two methods to infer educational inequa-
lity. The ﬁrst one is targeted at educational performance variance or standard deviation and, the
second one at educational opportunity percentage of variance that explains the inﬂuence of circums-
tances. Results indicate that 35% of all disparities in the educational performance of 57 countries that
participated in PISA 2006 are due to unequal opportunities.

In general, the set of opportunities is decisive for the educational performance of individuals.
These aspects are more remarkable in developing countries, especially in South American, Eastern
European, and Asian countries. Conversely, the lowest levels of unequal opportunities are mostly
observed in North American and Western European countries and in Oceania. And parental education
is the circumstance that most affects the results.

3 Empirical Strategy

The traditional theoretical framework dealing with unequal opportunities, suggested by Roemer (1998),
considers individual outcome, wi , to be explained by a set of variables: i) circumstance, Ci , for exam-
ple, family background, gender, region of birth, etc.; ii) effort, Ei , such as hours worked, time spent
on reading, etc. and; iii) brute luck component, ui . Where f (.) is an unknown function.

wi = f (Ci, Ei, ui).

(1)

However, combining these concepts with the theory of intergenerational transmission of education
and adapting them to the education production function, henceforth EPF, proposed by Hanuschek
(1970, 1979), with some peculiarities, yields:

ln(Ait) = g(F t

i , P t

i , Ii, St

i ).

(2)

Where At

i is the educational vector of the i-th student at t; F t

i is the vector of individual and family
characteristics of the i-th student accumulated at t; Ii is the vector of the student body (peer inﬂuence),
i.e., socioeconomic variables and family background of other students accumulated at t; is the vector
i is the vector of relevant school inputs for the i-th
of initial endowments of the i-th individual; and St
student accumulated at t. Actually, EPF analyzes how different inputs of the educational process may
affect individuals educational outcomes.

By including control variables that denote the circumstances and individual efforts, it becomes

identical to (3).

ln(W ∗

f,i) = α + βiW ∗

p,i + i.

(3)

Where ln(W ∗

f,i) is the log of performance of family i(cid:48)s child over time; W ∗

p,i is a vector of the
childs socioeconomic characteristics, such as the log of parental education, type of school, preschool
attendance, etc. and i is a term orthogonal to W ∗

f,i . That is:

E(i) = 0, E(i, W ∗

p,i) = 0, E(2

i ) = σ2
 .

(4)

Where β1 stands for the level of intergenerational transmission of education. Nonetheless, given
some possible weaknesses of this approach, due mainly to omitted variables, and given the possible
endogeneity of the vector of covariates, a method based on Bourguignon, Ferreira and Menndez
(2007) is used. In this case, a dependence between circumstance and effort variables is assumed. So,
the hypothesis assumed in (4) is relaxed. Mathematically, one has:

wi = f (Ci, Ei(Ci, vi), ui).

(5)

4

After that, a link is established with the intergenerational transmission approach and a log-linear

speciﬁcation as proposed in (3) is assumed, implying:

ln( ˆwi) = β1W ∗

p,i + β2E∗

f,i + uf,i.

(6)

Additionally, one assumes the endogeneity of certain variables that represent individual circums-

tances, yielding:
E∗
f,i = γW ∗

p,i + vi.

(7)
Where β2 and β2 denote two coefﬁcient vectors. In addition, ui and vi are random terms with
white noise properties that denote unobservable circumstance and effort variables, as well as the luck
factor. And γ is a matrix of coefﬁcients that links speciﬁc circumstance variables to effort variables.
In brief, it is assumed that coefﬁcients of this matrix inﬂuence effort variables.

This structure allows some effort variables to be clearly inﬂuenced by circumstances. It is thus
possible to observe the direct (β1 and β2 indirect effects of circumstance variables on individual
educational performance. Now let M (w) denote the marginal distribution of performance obtained
from (5). Thereafter, two counterfactuals are constructed: i) in the ﬁrst one, the overall effects of
circumstances are canceled out, i.e., wi = f (Ci, Ei(Ci, vi), ui); and ii) in the second one, only the
direct effects of circumstances are canceled out, wi = f (Ci, Ei(Ci, vi), ui). Therefore, if expressions
(6) and (7) can be estimated sensibly, the level of inequality persistence in individual performance is
given by:

ΘI =

I(M (w)) − I(M ( ˜w))

I(M (w))

.

(8)

In other words, the resulting vector of performance in (8) contains the overall inequality arising
from circumstance variables. On the other hand, equation (9) shows the level of inequality persistence
arising from direct circumstance effects.

Θd

I =

I(M (w)) − I(M (wd))

.

I(M (w))

So, indirect circumstance is simply determined by:

I = ΘI − Θd
ΘI
I.

(9)

(10)

Fortunately, for the decompositions proposed in (8) and (9), it is not necessary to compute struc-

tural systems (6) - (7). Then, substituting (7) into (6), one gets the reduced form:

ln( ˆwi) = (β1 + β2γ)Wp,i + viβ2 + uf,i.

(11)

However, as underlined by the authors, the omission of relevant variables in the determination
of the outcome and the possible endogeneity of circumstances cause the parameters obtained in (5)
and (11) to be biased and, consequently, counterfactuals are biased as well. That being said, and
in the absence of an appropriate set of instrumental variables, the authors suggest a Monte Carlo
simulation to create intervals for the estimated coefﬁcients. In order to circumvent such problems, this
study utilizes the post-estimation method bootstrapping replicating random samples one thousand
(1,000) times from the original sample and thus constructing a conﬁdence interval for the estimated
parameters.3 Second, an attempt was made to eliminate possible biases from the construction of
counterfactuals using a quantile approach, i.e., not based upon estimations of average effects alone.

3By using command sqreg in STATA 12, one estimates simultaneous quantile regressions for certain quantiles. It
produces the same coefﬁcients as the quantile regression for each quantile. The reported standard deviations are similar;
however, the variance-covariance matrix of estimators (VCE) is obtained via bootstrapping. VCE includes blocks between
the quantiles. Thus, it is possible to test and construct conﬁdence intervals, comparing coefﬁcients that describe different
quantiles.

5

After that, in order to determine to what extent an increment in social background circumstances
affects the performance on the test, as these factors are decisive for individual outcomes,4 one uses
the inference on counterfactual distributions method developed by Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val and
Melly (2013), henceforth ICD. The use of ICD is justiﬁed by the fact that this method is based on
different major approaches to estimate conditional quantile functions and conditional distribution
functions. Another advantage of this method is that it can be used to analyze the effect of simple
interventions
single change in a characteristic and in complex changes general changes in the
distribution of characteristics.

ICD is especially employed in cases in which an intervention policy gives rise to a change by
modifying part of the distribution of the set of explanatory variables X - covariates - which determine
the response in the variable of interest Y . In other words, ICD consists in estimating the effect on the
distribution of Y given a change in the distribution of X.

The results observed are obtained from the sample before the policy intervention and, therefore,
observable, whereas counterfactual outcomes stem from the sample after policy intervention and,
therefore, unobservable. Then it is admitted that covariates are observable before and after policy
intervention. That means that the observed outcomes are used to establish the relationship between
the variable of interest and covariates, which, alongside the counterfactual distribution of covariates,
determine the distribution of the outcome after the intervention under some conditions.

According to the authors, in order to specify a model that allows checking how the counterfactual
outcome is produced, it is important to analyze the relationship between the observed result and
covariates using a conditional quantile representation. For example, let W 0 denote the observed
result, and X 0 be (P × 1) vector of covariates with distribution function F 0
X before the intervention
policy. Where QY (u|X) denotes the u quantil conditional on W 0 given X 0. Thus, the result W 0 can
be linked to the conditional quantile function via the Skorohod representation, i.e.:

W 0 = QW (U 0|X 0),−→ U 0 ∼ U (1, 0) independently f rom X 0 ∼ F 0
X.

(12)

Where (12) highlights that the result is a function of covariates and of error term U 0. In classic re-
gression models, the error term is separated from independent variables as in point regression models,
but in general, it does not have to be. This method encompasses both cases.
In fact, the counterfactual inference process consists in designing the vector of covariates for a
different distribution, i.e., X C ∼ F C
X is a known distribution function of covariates after
the intervention policy. Hence, under the assumption that the conditional quantile function is not
altered by the policy, the counterfactual outcome Y C is obtained from:

X , where F C

W C = QW (U C|X C) −→ U C ∼ U (1, 0) independently f rom X C ∼ F C
X .

(13)
Additionally, ICD assumes that the quantile function QY (u|x) can be assessed at each point of x
X be a
X, i.e., that the quantile function be properly extrapolated. These assumptions

X . This assumption requires that the base of F C

in the base of distribution of the covariates of F C
subset of the base of F 0
are formulated as follows.

• S1 the conditional distribution of the result based on the covariates is the same before and after

the intervention policy;

• S2 the conditional model holds for all x ∈ X, where X is a compact-sized subset of RP that

contains bases of F 0

X and F C
X .

Furthermore, ICD contemplates two different types of changes in the distribution of covariates.
First, the covariates are designed for a different subsample before and after the intervention. This

4See, for instance, Barros (2009).

6

subsample can correspond to different demographic groups types time periods or geographical loca-
tions. For instance, workers characteristics in different years, parental socioeconomic distribution for
white or black individuals, or occasionally, for distribution of covariates in treatment groups versus
a control group. Second, the intervention can be used as a known transformation of the distribution
of observed covariates.
In summary, X C = g(X 0), where g(.) is a known function. For exam-
ple, unit changes in the location of one of the covariates, X C = X + ej, where ej is a unit vector
(P × 1) with one at position j; or it can preserve the redistribution of covariates implemented as
X C = (1 − α)E[X 0 + αX 0].

This type of intervention can be used, for instance, to estimate the effect on food expenses brought
about by a change in income tax; the inﬂuence on real estate prices as a result of the removal of ha-
zardous waste in the surrounding area, and so forth. Note that both cases above describe different
experimental scenarios. The main difference is that the second case corresponds to an almost per-
fectly controlled experience, which provides additional information for the identiﬁcation of more
characteristics of the joint distribution of results before and after the intervention. However, to make
inferences about the overall effect on the outcome, caused by the intervention, it is necessary to iden-
tify the distribution and quantile functions of the outcome before and after the policy. The conditional
distribution function associated with the quantile function QW (u|x) is expressed by:

FW (w|x) =

1{QW (u|x) ≤ w} du.

(14)

(cid:90) 1

0

Given the assumptions about how the counterfactual outcome is produced, the marginal distribu-

tion is expressed by:

FW j = P r{W j ≤ w} =

(cid:90)

x

FW (w|x)dF j

x (x).

(15)

With corresponding u quantil marginal functions.

QW j (u) = inf{W : FW j (w) ≤ u}.

(16)
Where j corresponds to the status before or after the intervention, J ∈ (0, C). The u quantil

treatment effect of the intervention policy is determined by:

QT E[W (u) = QWC (u) − QW0(u).

Analogously, the effect on u distribution of the policy is expressed by:

DEW (w) = FWC (w) − FW0(w).

(17)

ICD allows determining other functions of interest, for example, the Lorenz curve of the observed

3.1 Data Description and Analysis
The results of this paper will be available in PISA microdata for 2012. The program is developed
and coordinated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). There is
a national coordination body in each participating country. In Brazil, the assessment is coordinated
by the National Institute of Educational Studies and Research Ansio Teixeira (Inep). This database
is chosen for the wealth of information it provides. PISA is an international survey carried out every
three years to assess educational systems all over the world. It seeks to test the skills and knowledge
of 15-year-olds. The 2012 version is the ﬁfth edition of the program and assesses the competences of
students in reading, math, and sciences, giving emphasis to math.

An interesting fact is that around 510,000 students from 65 countries participated in the 2012
edition, accounting for about 28 million teenagers worldwide. Moreover, it is considered to be the
only survey that assesses activities that are not totally related to the school curriculum. As a matter
of fact, the tests are designed to assess to what extent students at the end of elementary school are
able to apply their knowledge to real-life, everyday situations and how able they are to participate
fully in society. In addition, the information collected by questionnaires provides ancillary data for
the interpretation of results.

As to the preliminary analyses of the data, reported in Table 1, note that there is a high level
of inequality in the average performance in all ﬁelds of knowledge, especially in South American
countries. For example, Brazil, in spite of being one of the 10 largest economies on the planet,
according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), had an extremely modest result. However,
recall that the results do not change signiﬁcantly in relation to the method and reports used by the
program. According to PISA, Brazil ranks in the 58th position among the 65 surveyed countries.

On the other hand, the performance of most Asian countries was excellent, with higher averages
than those obtained by OECD countries. As demonstrated by the data, the ﬁve best outcomes belong
to Asian countries. Additionally, there is a remarkable difference in the math test performance, which
is the focus of PISA 2012. Speciﬁcally, Shanghai scored approximately 90 points compared to Japan,

8

an OECD member. Asian countries outperformed South American ones by nearly 30%. For example,
in comparison with Chile which had the best performance among South American countries Singa-
pore showed a positive difference around 28% in favor of Asian countries, despite a larger variance
in average scores in the latter. This occurs due to the poor performance notably obtained by Malaysia
and Indonesia.

That being said, the microdata used are split into: i) variables related to the students; ii) variables
related to the parents (characteristics of individuals and their families) iii) variables related to the
schools (speciﬁc characteristics). The combination of these databases allows compiling information
about circumstance and effort variables and individual outcomes.

Nonetheless, four speciﬁcation tests were performed to choose the best set of covariates.5 The
following tests were carried out: ovtest, backward stepwise, forward stepwise, and hierarchical. Ov-
test aimed to detect problems with omitted variables. The other three tests were used to identify the
inclusion or exclusion of variables.6 Besides the observation of test results, classic variables used
in the literature were also chosen.7 Based upon this, in the ﬁrst approach, the log of the individual
average on PISA was regressed as a function of the circumstance variables described in what follows.
The second approach included variables that express individual effort. Speciﬁcally, the variables used
in this paper are summarized in Chart 1.

As pointed out earlier, the ﬁrst approach uses only the vector of circumstance variables, providing
information about 336.286 students out of 422.413 from 58 countries. On the other hand, in the
second approach, the vector of variables that denote effort is included in the estimations. At this
stage, data on 225.629 students from 58 countries are used. The reason why the data neither reﬂect the
available total nor the failure to include all countries had to do with missing information. However,
the restriction concerning the nature of the data used is a consensus, given that, in assessments in
which there are no direct consequences for students, teachers, or schools, students skills are likely to
be underestimated.8

After such remark, we now provide a brief account of the PISA sample. Table 2 summarizes some
characteristics of the database. In the analyzed data, nearly 50% of those who took the test in 2012

4 Results
This section presents the major results of the paper. Table 3 reports the estimations of equation (3)9
for the general sample. As expected, results suggest strong inﬂuence of circumstances on individual
outcomes. The set of opportunities accounts for approximately 35% of all disparities observed on the
test.

Following this same line of thought, it should be noted that the characteristics that most inﬂuenced
the results of PISA 2012 were, respectively, parental education, preschool attendance, type of school,

location of the school, educational difference between parents, and gender.10 In sum, as demonstrated
by other studies (e.g., Ferreira and Gignoux (2011)), social background circumstances has a signi-
ﬁcant impact on outcomes. Another interesting aspect can be observed as to the negative effect of
parental educational difference on the test. The negative inﬂuence of this variable informs that the
larger the asymmetry educational disparity between fathers and mothers the lower the score. This
ﬁnding is consistent with the literature (e.g., Bourguignon, Ferreira and Menendez (2007)), although
it is still quite incipient. In addition, in upper quantiles, the sex variable sometimes is not statistically
different from zero.

Additionally, the inﬂuence of parental education on test results is more striking in developed
countries. All in all, intergenerational educational transmission is clearly stronger in these countries.
The results shown in graph 1 illustrate this situation. Note that, for example, Argentina and Brazil
together have parental educational transmission less than 50% of the effect observed for the Japanese,
French, and Chinese, and almost three times lower than that found for the Czech and the Slovak.
Speciﬁcally, Argentina and Brazil occupy, respectively, the 51st and 56th position in the educational
transmission ranking among 58 countries. According to general estimates, Brazil only has slightly
better results than Macao and Qatar.

Figure 1 - Parental Inﬂuence Educational PISA test - Average

Note: Data Research

Could these results suggest, for example, in the theory of educational mobility, that Brazil and
Argentina have low educational persistence and, therefore, high mobility? And that the Czech Re-
public, Slovakia, Japan, and France have high persistence and, therefore, low mobility? The answer
is no, because this study employs an educational assessment system PISA 2012 rather than income
or educational attainment as most studies in this area. Several studies that indicate low mobility in
developing countries conﬁrm this. In these countries, individuals who attend college or have a college
degree are often children of individuals who have at least a college degree.11 In developed countries,
this relation is not so predominant, as there are more opportunities and better quality of education.

10The results remained unchanged for the average score in sciences, languages, and math. See tables in the appendix.
11See, for instance, Daude (2011) and Hertz et al. (2007).

According to Black and Devereux (2010), it can be conceptually admitted that the educational
choice of young people is associated with some factors, especially with educational costs, educational
returns, and family income. The latter is related mainly to cases with credit restrictions. On the
other hand, there appears to be some agreement that educational returns are larger for more skillful
individuals and also for those with better-educated parents. These hypotheses imply that individuals
with better educated parents tend to pursue a higher level of education because of: i) direct effects
better educated parents also interpreted as causal channel, and, ii) indirect effects, i.e., being more
skillful inheritability evinced by the intergenerational transmission of education.

Moreover, according to the authors, it is possible that underlying mechanisms bring direct effects
of parental education on the performance of individuals. In general, the better the parental education,
the higher the family income and, consequently, the more positive the impact on school performance.
Second, this characteristic may expand the time devoted to developing remedial activities with their
children. Also, it allows increasing the bargaining power of families, as more educated mothers can
be more susceptible to spending on investments and activities targeted at teenagers or children in their
families.

Another important aspect is the presence of qualiﬁed intergenerational educational mobility. In
brief, developed countries usually have a higher level of education and, therefore, will have better
educated children. Speciﬁcally, in Brazil and in developing countries, this might not hold. On average,
parental education years of schooling of parents in these countries is lower, as reported in Table A.4
in the Appendix.

Looking at Table A.4, another interesting pattern concerns the value obtained for variables such
as: type of school, preschool attendance, and location of the school, which plays a crucial role in deve-
loping countries, suggesting heterogeneity in quality of education, and differs from what is observed
for developed countries, where these variables do not have a strong inﬂuence on school performance.
Particularly in Brazil and Argentina, the simple fact of attending a private school affects the PISA
score (17% and 14%, respectively). However, in countries such as Germany and Japan, these effects
are incipient.

Some variables related to individual effort were added in this line of research, although, in prin-
ciple, the hypothesis postulated in equation (4) was assumed. However, before discussing the results
shown in Table 4, graph 2 shows eight different speciﬁcations that take into account continental dum-

12

mies. The estimated results are clearly similar.12 Notwithstanding, the speciﬁcation tests inform that
the general model has a better ﬁt without the continental dummies.

In other words, the results described in Table 4 do not differ signiﬁcantly from those reported in
Table 3.13 Conspicuously, the estimated coefﬁcients effects of the covariates albeit smaller, are quite
similar, thereby suggesting good ﬁt of the model. Additionally, the afore-mentioned identiﬁcation
tests corroborate these results. Nevertheless, two facts deserve special attention among the covariates

that represent individual effort in the results. First, the strong inﬂuence of a student not having re-
peated a grade in school. That is, this inﬂuences, on average, 11.2% the test performance. Second,
the small effect attributed to actual effort and potential effort, with an emphasis on the sign of the
latter, indicating a high rate of non-response. This characteristic shows the limitation of these data.
In other words, as the test theoretically does not have any inﬂuence on the life of students, teachers,
and schools, there is a high rate of non-responses, especially regarding more complex questions. In
the same vein, the coefﬁcient of the perseverance variable seemingly supports this body of evidence.
As to school-related variables such as type of school, location of school, and preschool, they have
been suggested to account for nearly 20% of the differences between the performances. Of this va-
riable, preschool attendance is the most important. This variable is even more remarkable when we
take into consideration the results of Asian countries. That is, in these economies, the inﬂuence of
preschool attendance is, on average, four times stronger than that observed for OECD and South Ame-
rican countries, and approximately three times stronger than that of Nordic countries. Nonetheless,

12M1 no dummy for continents; M2 dummy for OECD; M3 is equal to M2 plus a dummy (Asian countries); M4 is
equal to M3 with inclusion of a dummy (Nordic countries); M5 general model including the vector of individual efforts.
For the other models, continental dummies are added one at a time.

13The results remained unchanged for the average score in sciences, languages, and math. See tables in the Appendix.

although the general results for the type of school public or private demonstrate a smaller inﬂuence
on test results, when we assess the results of South American countries, this inﬂuence is nearly ﬁve ti-
mes more effective than in OECD countries, about seven times the effect observed in Asian countries,
and inﬁnitely larger than that of Nordic countries.

Notwithstanding, there is empirical evidence of possible endogeneity between the covariates cir-
cumstance and effort variables and, therefore, it produces biases in the estimated coefﬁcients. Addi-
tionally, despite the inclusion of variables that represent individual effort, not all variables omission
that inﬂuence the result are available. In this respect, in an attempt to check and correct these pro-
blems, the method based on Bourguignon, Ferreira and Menndez (2007) is used. In sum, it is assumed
that there is some dependence between circumstance and effort variables. That is, the assumption
made in (4) is refuted.

Taking this scenario into consideration, we ﬁrst calculate the level of inequality for the factual
distribution of the overall average of results. After that, we estimate the reduced-form coefﬁcients
equation 10 for the respective quantiles (0.25; 0.50 and 0.75). In turn, using the mean coefﬁcients es-
timated in (10), as well as the lower and upper extremes, we simulated the counterfactual distribution
M (w) originating from expression: ˜w = exp[(β1 + γβ2)W ∗
p,i + ei],
onde β1 + γβ2 = βi e i = viβ2 + uf,i.

p,i + viβ2 + uf, i → ˜w = exp[βiW ∗

In brief, the level of inequalities for factual distributions w and ˜w is calculated. After that, fol-
lowing equation (7), one obtains the total participation of the set of opportunities in the inequality of
scores. Note that the standard deviation of logs was used as level of inequality. Similar results were
obtained with the coefﬁcient of variation. However, other indices are broadly used in the literature,
e.g. Ferreira and Gignoux (2011); and Lefranc, Pistolesi and Trannoy (2009).

Likewise, the partial or direct effect of the participation of opportunities observed in total ine-
quality is estimated. First, (5) is estimated directly, and then, by using the estimated coefﬁcients,
p,i + Ei] + ui. It should be

noted that, in the ﬁrst counterfactual M ( ˜w), the effect of circumstances is totally canceled out, while
in the second one, M (wd

i ) is built, derived from: wd

i = exp[β4W ∗

It is suggested that the inequality in PISA 2012 performance results is reduced by approximately
21% when one equals the set of individual opportunities. In turn, the participation of the set of op-
portunities denoted by eight variables in test performance varies in a stable fashion across quantiles.
In other words, unequal opportunities do not seem to change the pattern across the quantiles of the
observed distribution.

As to direct effects, they represent around 18%. That is, by canceling out only the direct effects of
circumstances, the total inequality of the distribution of scores decreases, on average, 18.7%. These

results are noteworthy as the indirect effect of circumstances is given by: Θi
there is a positive effect of favorable circumstances on individual effort around 2.3% to 2.8%. Based
on these results, two inferences can be made: i) circumstances have an effect on individual effort; and
ii) the magnitude of this effect is around 15% of the total of unfair inequality observed on the test.

I = ΘI − Θd

In other words, the individual effort put in by different sets of opportunities is inﬂuenced by the
circumstances that the individual is under. Interestingly, the observed effects are stronger in the lower
quantile. That is, the worse the performance of the student on the test, the stronger the inﬂuence of
circumstances on effort.

Nonetheless, the effects of circumstances on effort variables grade retention, perseverance, stu-
dent migration, actual and potential efforts are likely to be stronger. Unobserved circumstances are
likely to account for a larger variance in random residuals vi in equation (6). In addition, it is re-
asonable to assume that the decision of some variables denoted here as effort is a parents decision,
especially because the students who took the test are all 15 year old. In sum, let us suppose that stu-
dent migration and retention are decided by the parents and that the other three variables are strongly

After considering this, we constructed the counterfactual w = exp[βiW ∗

p,i +Eiβi+ui]. The results
reported in panel (D) of Table 5 indicate a total participation rate of 21% in the overall inequality in
the score. So, if all variables circumstances and effort were equated, overall inequality would be
around 16.9%. Note that the values observed are exactly the same as those for total participation of
circumstances in test results.

circumstance variables separately in overall inequality. To do that, we simulated the following

Results are consistent with those found in the literature (see, for instance, Ferreira and Veloso
(2006). Note that education, type of school, and preschool attendance are the three major determinants
of unfair inequality.14 Speciﬁcally, if we equated parental education, type of school, and preschool
attendance, the overall inequality in test performance would decline by 17% to 19%. On the other
hand, sex is the least relevant circumstance. It is statistically insigniﬁcant in many scenarios. In short,
sex is not a determinant of inequality in test performance.

In addition, Table 7 summarizes the decomposition results for the inﬂuence of circumstances
in terms of countries and continents. Note that the indirect effects on individual effort are more
signiﬁcant in Asian and Nordic countries, respectively, and less remarkable in OECD and South
American countries, but the magnitude of inequality in test performance is larger in the latter group.
In turn, it is necessary to understand which factors are involved in this indirect effect. Aspects such as
skill and motivation through intergenerational transmission of parental education could be a decisive
factor. Would the fact that these countries historically have a better quality of education explain such
difference? According to the literature, the answer is yes, as it is commonly known that three are
the factors that can determine intergenerational educational transmission: genetics, parents behavior,
and environmental factors.15 However, the results are inconclusive because, although France has an
indirect effect of 0.17, OECD and some of its key members Japan, for example yielded smaller
values than those found in South American countries.

It is believed that the indirect effect of circumstances on South American countries is less strong
due to several factors, such as quality of parental education and quality of schools, since this charac-
teristic outperforms the effects of parental education, except for Chile. To have an idea, in Brazil and
in Argentina, the effect of school on test performance is respectively 30% to 60% stronger than the
effect of education. These ﬁndings, which correspond to 73.5% of adolescents from these countries
who took the PISA 2012, indicate a possible solution to the problem, i.e., it is clearly necessary to
ameliorate the quality of schools, especially of public ones.

Moreover, this problem deteriorates when preschool attendance and location of the school are
taken into account, as shown in Table A.4. In general, indirect effects are more remarkable in de-

veloped countries, mainly in France and Finland. On the other hand, where this phenomenon is not
observed, as in Japan and South Korea, factors like type of schools, location of schools, and preschool
attendance are not statistically signiﬁcant. That is, these factors are homogenous and, therefore, their
indirect effect can be observed on effort.

Following the objectives of this paper, we now verify the effects of an increment in individual
socioeconomic set through the ICD method. First, we look at the results of the log estimation of the
overall average of individual scores as a function of a dummy for the fathers and mothers education,
as well as for family structure, type of school, preschool attendance, and location of school.

The quantile average treatment effect QATE estimated for all circumstance variables except
for sex and living with siblings is shown in Table 8. Results were statistically signiﬁcant at 1%.
However, the average gap observed for parental education was around 8%, of which 2% is explained
by differences in the level of parental education of the distribution and 6% is due to differences in the
average coefﬁcients between children of parents with at least a college degree and children of parents
with at most high school education. As to the type of school either public or private the mean
difference in the test performance is around 6%, of which 1.5% is related to education in a private
school. Note that the share explained by residuals is negligible for all the proposed treatments.

The average treatment referring to preschool attendance was approximately 14%. However, only
21% of this effect has to do with preschool attendance. In the analyzed database, there is no infor-
mation about the age at which preschool attendance began, which limits our analysis. According to
Spinath et al. (2003), early childhood 0 to 6 years of age plays a pivotal role in the development of
the overall cognitive skill.16 With respect to the other variables family structure and location of scho-
ols respectively, the QATE ranged from 5% to 6%. In this case, having a single-parent family and
going to a school in the urban area affects the test performance by around 1.5% to 2%, respectively.
Nevertheless, in order to understand the behavior of the pattern of these effects across countries,
we estimated the same treatment separately for each country. The results reported in Table A.9 of the
Appendix indicate a large variation in the treatment effects across countries. For example, regarding
parental education, although there is a similar mean difference across continents between 9% and
12%, the treatment effect of having better educated parents in South America is 7.5 times stronger
than that observed in OECD countries, and respectively 3 to 4.5 times that observed for Asian and
Nordic countries.

Conversely, in South American countries, the mean difference between treatment and control
groups private and public schools is inﬁnitely larger than in Asian countries, and respectively 2 to 3
times greater than that observed in OECD and in Nordic countries. Speciﬁcally, this effect is seven
times larger on Brazil than on France and 20 times larger than that noticed in the USA. However,

16According to Carroll (1997), there is a general intelligence factor that makes it easier to deal with information and

problems of a certain class or syllabus.

only about one third is explained by the type of school students attend. Furthermore, these effects are
quite similar to those found in some OECD, Asian, and Nordic countries. These ﬁndings apparently
suggest, once again, that the quality of education is poor.

Nonetheless, the treatment effect of preschool attendance is way more signiﬁcant in countries that
had the best performance on PISA. For example, in France and in Japan, the effect of this charac-
teristic is approximately 10%, compared to 4% observed in Argentina and in Brazil. In general, all
results indicate that the poor performance, especially of South American countries compared to other
countries, is essentially determined by the set of opportunities. Roughly analyzing Table A.4 in the
Appendix, it is clear that the observed inequality explained by the set of individual characteristics
sum of individual effects amounts to nearly 0.35 compared to 0.11 in OECD countries, 0.15 in Asian
countries, and 0.13 in Nordic countries. That is, they correspond to 91% of the total observed in other
three continents together.

In this respect, given that the treatment effect is way more signiﬁcant in these countries, why is
the elasticity intergenerational transmission estimated for them lower? Results indicate that in per-
formance variables, instead of educational ones, such as years of schooling, the quality of education
is determined. That is, having parents with a college degree is not enough; it is necessary to have
educated parents who transfer knowledge and skills to their children. In addition, the role of school in
these countries seems to be essential, according to the results. That is, we must do more than educate
individuals; we must prepare them to develop and apply their knowledge.

5 Some Remarks

In this paper, we sought to shed some light upon the mechanisms that underlie educational perfor-
mance. Three were our major goals. First, to verify the level of transmission and intergenerational
correlation of education. Second, to decompose the effects that determine intergenerational trans-
mission set of opportunities into direct and indirect. Third, to make a counterfactual analysis by
equalizing the socioeconomic circumstances of the students who took PISA 2012. At least three in-
ferences can be made from the results: i) there is low parental education transmission in developing
countries, especially in South America; ii) there are indirect effects of circumstances on effort vari-
ables, and these effects vary among individuals, countries, and continents. Finally, in line with the
low educational transmission by the parents, the treatment effect is substantially stronger in those
countries with these characteristics.

Additionally, looking at the results reported in Table A.4, the factors associated with school, ex-
cept preschool, are signiﬁcant only in developing countries, speciﬁcally in South American countries.
On the other hand, except for Chile, the treatment effect of preschool attendance in these economies is
usually weaker than that observed in countries with the best performance scores. These ﬁndings sug-
gest that preschool attendance does matter; however, we highlight quality (see, for instance, Foguel
and Veloso, 2012). If we take a look at Chile, South American country with the best test performance,
we perceive that schooling associated with individual socioeconomic background is most important.
For other countries of this continent often with the worst performance scores this factor is not that
important. In other words, unlike most of the countries in which the best test scores are observed in
preschool, in these countries, preschool attendance has a small inﬂuence. This further underscores
the doubts about the quality of education in these countries.
