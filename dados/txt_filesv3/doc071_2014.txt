Resumo 
Os modelos de crescimento balance of payments constrained podem ser utilizados para 
capturar  importantes  insights  tanto  da  tradição  keynesiana  quanto  estruturalista  do 
pensamento econômico. Sugerimos que a Lei de Thirlwall corresponde a uma derivação 
matemática  da  regra  de  Prebisch.  Dada  sua  similaridade,  nos  perguntamos  por  que  a 
tese  Prebisch-Singer  da  deterioração  dos  termos  de  troca  não  é  incluída  no  modelo. 
Dessa  forma,  este  trabalho  se  propõe  a  estreitar  a  relação  entre  a  Lei  de  Thirlwall  e  o 
pensamento  cepalino  através  de  uma  tentativa  de  acrescentar  na  primeira  um 
componente  que  capte  a  hipótese  de  Prebisch-Singer,  empregando  para  tal  uma 
definição de taxa de câmbio real alternativa. Propomos-nos ainda a endogeneizar a taxa 
de crescimento do produto e da produtividade a partir da combinação de nossa versão da 
lei de Thirlwall com a lei de Kaldor-Verdoorn.

Abstract 
The  balance-of-payments-constrained  growth  models  can  be  used  to  capture  key 
economic  insights  of  both  the  Keynesian  and  structuralist  tradition.  We  suggest  that 
Thirlwall's  law  corresponds  to  a  mathematical  derivation  from  Prebisch’s  rule.  Given 
their similarity, we  wonder why the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis of deterioration of  the 
terms-of-trade  is  not  included  in  the  model.  Thus,  this  study  aims  to  develop  the 
relationship  between  Thirlwall's  Law  and  ECLAC’s  thought  adding  to  the  first  a 
component  that  captures  the  Prebisch-Singer  hypothesis.  For  such  it  is  employed  an 
alternative  definition  for  the  real  exchange  rate.  We  call  the  final  expression  the 
Prebisch-Thirlwall  rule.  Further,  we  endogenize  the  output  and  productivity  rate  of 
growth  through  the  combination  of  our  version  of  Thirlwall's  law  with  the  Kaldor-
Verdoorn’s law.

1.  Introduction 
The idea that in the long-term economic growth is limited by the emergence of trade 
imbalances  has  a  strong  tradition  in  Latin  America  (Porcile,  Curado  and  Cruz,  2012). 
The work of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) 
and  especially  the  argentine  economist  Raúl  Prebisch  already  indicated  the  low 
dynamism of the export sector and the high propensity to import as the main limiting to 
growth in peripheral economies. The ECLAC’s school of economic thought shows in its 
documents,  especially  from  the  50s,  a  major  concern  with  the  relationship  between 
income elasticity  associated with  foreign trade, the diffusion of technical progress  and 
economic  development  in  peripheral  economies  (Prebisch,  1959;  Rodríguez,  2009 
[2006]).  

In turn, the post-Keynesian literature developed a series of growth models demand-
side  among  which  stand  the  out  so-called  balance-of-payments-constrained  (BOPC), 
notably  represented  by  the  Thirlwall’  law.  Its  central  proposition  is  that,  for  most 
countries, the major constraint to the product’s growth rate is in the balance of payments 
because  it  determines  the  limit  to  demand’s  growth  rate  that  supply  can  adapt 
(Thirlwall, 1979; Alonso and Garcimartín, 1999; Thirlwall, 2011).  

Although  apparently  he  built  his  model  independently,  Thirlwall  (1983)  mentions 
the  similarities  between  his  formulation  and  the  Prebisch’s  one.  We  suggest  that 
Thirlwall's  law  can  be  understood  as  a  mathematical  formalization  of  ECLAC’s 
thinking  derived  from  Prebisch  rule.  Given  their  similarity,  we  wonder  why  the 
Prebisch-Singer  thesis  of  deterioration  of  the  terms-of-trade  for  primary  products 
relative to manufactured goods is not explicitly included in the model. Thus, this study 
aims  to  develop  the  relationship  between  the  Thirlwall’s  law  and  ECLAC’s  thought 
adding to the first a component that captures the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis.  

Since  its  initial  formulation,  BOPC  models  have  evolved  to  incorporate  the  other 
components  of  the  balance  of  payments.  Therefore,  this  is  not  the  first  attempt  to 
incorporate the dynamics of prices to the BOPC framework (Dutt, 2003; Blecker, 2009; 
Ros,  2013).  However,  our  proposal  is  unique  in  introducing  the  Prebisch-Singer 
hypothesis  from  an  alternative  definition  for  the  real  exchange  rate.  Thus,  our 
contribution aims to give greater strength to the theoretical framework in question.  

There  seems  to  have  been  an  initial  fear  of  incorporating  the  terms-of-trade  in  the 
model  since  the  balance  of  payments  adjustment  through  prices  could  lead  to  an 
adjustment not via income, disqualifying the Thirlwall’s law. However, contrary to this 
neoclassical  assumption,  we  consider  that  it  is  the  deterioration  of  terms-of-trade  of 
primary  products  in  relation  to  manufactured  goods  that  can  reduce  the  compatible 
growth rate with equilibrium in the balance of payments. The empirical  evidence does 
not support the neoclassical view, as shown by Alonso e Garcimartin (1999).  

The  post-Keynesian  analytical  models  assume  that  the  long-term  growth  is 
essentially  endogenous  to  the  operation  of  the  economic  system.  This  means  that  the 
growth  of  output  and  labor  productivity  cannot  be  treated  as  exogenous  variables  in 
growth  models  (Oreiro,  2011).  Further,  we  endogenize  the  output  and  productivity 
growth rate through the combination of our version of Thirlwall's law with the Kaldor-
Verdoorn’s law. The possibility of including cumulative causation in the BOPC growth 
models has been recently explored by authors like Blecker (2009), Amitrano (2013) and 
Araújo  (2013). However, our modeling  exercise  differs  from  previous initiatives since 
the  relation  between  BOPC  and  Kaldor-Verdoorn  is  not  obtained  through  prices  but 
through the foreign trade elasticities, as we will show further.  

This  work  is  divided  into  four  sections  besides  this  introduction.  In  section  2  we 
review  the  main  concepts  behind  the  ECLAC’s  thinking  of  economic  growth  with

particular  emphasis  on  the  ideas  developed  by  Prebisch  and  the  Prebisch-Singer 
hypothesis  of  deterioration  of  the  terms-of-trade.  The  next  section  presents  the  main 
versions of Thirlwall's law relating it to the ECLAC’s thinking. In Section 4 we present 
our  proposal  of  adding  a  component  that  captures  the  Prebisch-Singer  thesis  of 
deterioration in terms-of-trade, employing an alternative definition for the real exchange 
rate.  We  call  the  final  expression  obtained  the  Prebisch-Thirlwall  rule.  Finally,  in 
section  5,  we  endogenize  the  output  and  productivity’s  growth  rate  by  combining  our 
version of Thirlwall's law with the Kaldor-Verdoorn’s law. The last section contains the 
concluding remarks. 

2.  Latin-American structuralism and the external trade restrictions 
The idea that in the long-term economic growth is limited by the emergence of trade 
imbalances  has  a  strong  tradition  in  Latin  America  (Porcile,  Curado  and  Cruz,  2012). 
Within  the  ECLAC’s  school  of  economic  thought,  the  names  of  Raúl  Prebisch,  Juan 
Noyola  and  Celso  Furtado  stand  for  working  with  the  implications  of  the  external 
constraint  on  growth.  Although  there  are  important  differences  between  their 
formulations,  a  common  element  is  that  both  share  the  structuralist  approach  to 
development (Boianovsky and Solis, 2014). In this section we will try to summarize the 
main  elements  of  the  structuralist  approach  and  the  considerations  made  by  Prebisch 
regarding restrictions on foreign trade. 
2.1.1 The latin american structuralism 

The  studies  included  under  the  common  name  of  "structuralists"  share  certain 
methodological positions that operate as essential basis of their analytical contributions 
(Rodríguez 2009 [2006]). Its method takes particular account of the real characteristics 
of  the  analyzed  situations  and  their  dependence  on  structural  factors  historically 
determined (Bielschowsky, 2009). The starting point of our analysis and  that guide the 
description of this school of thought lies in its understanding of the process of economic 
development. 

Development  is  understood,  from  a  strictly  economic  perspective,  as  the 
continued and sustained  output’s growth and  capital  endowment  per worker expressed 
in  the  increase  of  the  material  well-fare.  This  process  in  turn  is  driven  by  technical 
progress  and  must  necessarily  be  accompanied  by  changes  in  the  production  and 
demand structure (Furtado, 2009 [1961]; Rodríguez, 2009 [2006]). We can represent the 
above definition as follows. The average productivity of the economy 𝑞  is given by: 

𝑛

𝑞  =   𝜃𝑖𝑞𝑖

                                                                                                  (2.1) 

1

Where  𝜃𝑖   corresponds  to  the  weight  of  each  sector  of  the  economy  and  𝑞𝑖  defines 
sectoral productivity. Differentiating this expression respect to time we obtain: 

𝑛

𝑛

𝑞   =   𝜃𝑖 𝑞𝑖  +   𝜃𝑖  𝑞𝑖

1

1

                                                                               (2.2) 

The  expression  above  captures  the  two  key  components  of  the  structuralist 
approach. The first puts variations of the average productivity as a result of changes in 
sectoral productivities. Changes in 𝑞𝑖 lead to changes in 𝑞  for a constant 𝜃𝑖 . The second 
component  however  shows  that  changes  in  the  sectoral  composition  (𝜃𝑖 )  also  lead  to 
changes  in  average  productivity  (𝑞 ).  The  transfer  of  workers  from  low  productivity 
sectors to high productivity sectors can increase ceteris paribus the average productivity 
of the economy. Thus, the multi-sectoral structural component has great importance in 
contrast to the neoclassical models with only 1 sector.

Underdevelopment,  in  turn,  is  seen  as  a  specific  way  of  being  for  certain 
economies which cannot  be studied as a single stage of the development  process.  It  is 
considered  that  both  correspond  to  different  aspects  of  the  same  historical  process 
connected  to  the  creation  and  diffusion  of  technology  in  post-industrial  revolution 
(Furtado,  2009  [1961];  Rodríguez,  2009  [2006]).  It  is  characterized  by  a  profound 
structural  heterogeneity  in  production  and  distribution.  Thus,  in  countries  in  this 
condition is observed the combination of a very unequal distribution of income and the 
coexistence of high and low productivity sectors. 

The definitions above allow us to introduce a last element of vital importance in 
structuralist  thought:  the  center-periphery  system.  According  to  Cimoli  and  Porcile 
(2013), the ECLAC’s thinking is based on the perception that the international system is 
formed by two poles, the center (north) and the periphery (south), whose economies are 
structurally  different.  Although  authors  such  as  Celso  Furtado  prefer  to  avoid  this 
terminology  its clear the  contrast  between the developed countries, situated as  central, 
and  underdeveloped,  occupying  a  peripheral  position.  The  centers  identify  themselves 
as possessing the most advanced production techniques thereby achieving higher levels 
of  labor  productivity  and  greater  homogenization  of  its  production  and  demand 
structure. The periphery on the other hand is formed by economies technologically and 
organizationally backward beyond a deep structural heterogeneity. 

2.1 The external trade restrictions and the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis 
Prebisch's  initial  interest  in  studying  the  dynamics  of  Latin  American  foreign 
trade  was  to  explain  the  mechanism  behind  the  economic  cycles  in  those  economies 
(Boianovsky and Solis, 2014). Indeed, the concept of Harrod trade multiplier is used to 
distinguish  their  effects  in  the  center  and  the  periphery.  However,  his  analysis  is  not 
limited  to  business  cycles  and  he  also  studied  the  impact  of  international  trade  on  the 
long-term growth and price behavior (Rodríguez 2009 [2006]). 

It  is  observed  that  the  world  trade  reflects  the  position  of  an  economy  in  the 
center-periphery  dynamic.  The  countries  of  the  center,  being  leaders  in  R&D,  would 
export manufactured products with higher added value and technological intensity. The 
periphery countries that turn to occupy marginal position in terms of innovation, would 
export  primary  products  with  low  added  value  (Prebisch,  1959;  Prebisch,  1963;  Sai 
Wing-Ho, 2012). The specialization in the periphery implies that the rate of expansion 
of its production is limited by margins that if exceeded would lead to the deterioration 
of the terms-of-trade (Rodríguez 2009 [2006]). 

It is considered that domestic income  growth in the periphery is constrained by 
the income elasticity of imports since there is a limited supply of foreign exchange with 
which a country can rely to satisfy its needs for imports. Prebisch (1949, 1959) defines 
the structural imbalance1 as the result of an increase in income that leads to an increase 
in imports above those permitted by exports. According to Rodríguez (2009 [2006]) in 
his  analysis  of  the  structuralist  thought,  the  trade  imbalance  is  thus  the  key  to  the 
external imbalance problems, marked by the alternation of boom and scarcity phases of 
foreign exchange. 

But  what  does  differentiate  the  industrial  from  the  primary  products?  Two 
explanations  are  given  to  this  question.  The  first  one  is  related  to  differences  in  their 
income  elasticities.  Primary  products  have  elasticity  less  than  unity  since  technical 
progress  reduces  the  demand  for  raw  materials  by  replacing  them  with  synthetic.  It’s 
observed  in  addition  and  according  to  Engel’s  law  a  saturation  of  demand  for  basic 
                                                           
1The  term  "structural  imbalance"  was  introduced  the  first  time  by  Noyola  and  Furtado  in  an  ECLAC’s 
document  during  the  50s  and  was  not  initially  used  by  Prebisch.  He  employed  it  only  in  the  60s 
(Boianovsky and Solis, 2014).

foods. These factors are exacerbated by a lower rate of increase in population centers. In 
contrast,  the  income  elasticity  of  manufactured  products  would  be  higher  than  unity 
since these products are at the technological frontier. 

Prebisch  (1959,  p.4)  constructs  a  numerical  example  illustrating  the  effects  of 
external constraint on economic growth. As a simplifying hypothesis it is assumed that 
there is only 1 country in the center and in the periphery. If in the central economy the 
output  growth  rate  is  3%  and  the  income  elasticity  of  imports  is  0.80,  then  imports  in 
the  center  could  grow  at  a  rate  of  2.4%  (3  x  0.80).  On  the  other  hand,  assuming  the 
elasticity  of  demand  for  industrial  products  in  the  periphery  equal  to  1.3,  periphery’s 
growth rate to maintain balance in BP cannot exceed 1.84% (2.4 : 1.3). If the peripheral 
economy grows at the same rate of the center, its exports would have to grow at 3.9% to 
keep the BP balanced, well above the center demand for their exports. In mathematical 
terms we have: 

𝑥 
𝜋

𝑦  =

                                                                                                             (2.3) 

where  𝑦   is  the  output  growth  rate,  𝜋  is  the  income  elasticity  of  imports  and  𝑥  
corresponds to the exports growth rate. 

To maintain the equilibrium in the balance of payments, imports cannot growth 
more than 𝑥 . As noted by Cimoli and Porcile (2013), Boianovsky and Solis (2014) and 
by  Thirlwall  (1983)  himself  the  final  expression  is  precisely  equivalent  to  Thirlwall’s 
law. The empirical evidence that brings support to this argument is intertwined with the 
support found to Thirlwall's law, and will be further explored in the next section. 

The  second  explanation  for  the  differentiation  between  primary  and  industrial 
products  became  known  in  the  literature  as  the  Prebisch-Singer  hypothesis  of 
deterioration  of  the  terms-of-trade.  It  is  argued  that  there  is  a  secular  trend  of 
deterioration  in  terms-of-trade  in  favor  of  industrial  goods  and  against  primary  goods. 
Traditionally  four  factors  are  appointed  as  responsible  for  this  phenomenon:  (i)  the 
existence of market power in the industrial sector in contrast to competitive markets in 
the  commodities  sector  (Singer,  1950;  Mollic  et  al,  2008),  (ii)  pressure  from  the 
difference  in  income  elasticities  of  manufactured  and  primary  products,  (iii)  unequal 
distribution  of  human  capital  and  knowledge  and  (iv)  labor  market  asymmetries 
between center and periphery (Prebisch, 1963; Ocampo e Parra, 2010). 

Singer  (1950)  was  the  main  defender  of  the  first  argument  while  the  work  of 
Prebisch focused on the last one. This especially distinguished from others as it would 
apply to all goods produced by the periphery and not just the primary ones. The central 
idea contained in the work of Singer is quite intuitive. Assuming that technical progress 
is  concentrated  in  industrial  activity,  this  would  allow  firms  in  the  center  to  have 
monopoly  power  for  a  period  of  time,  which  would  not  occur  in  the  primary  activity. 
Prebisch  in  turn  considers  that  the  relative  slowness  in  world’s  demand  growth  for 
commodities,  associated  with  the  existence  of  a  large  surplus  population  in  the 
periphery, would generate a downward pressure on wages which in turn would result in 
such deterioration. 

Although  it’s  a  controversial  issue,  there  is  a  wide  range  of  studies  supporting 
the  Prebisch-Singer  thesis.  As  one  of  the  first  efforts  in  this  direction,  Thirlwall  and 
Bergevin  (1985)  examined the behavior of commodity prices relative to manufactured 
for  the  period  1954-1982.  The  authors  not  only  confirmed  the  deterioration  but  also 
shown that price fluctuations are greater for primary products. Anyway, Grilli and Yang 
(1988) are noted as the first most solid references on the subject and their time series is 
used as a standard in  most  subsequent  work in the area. The authors constructed price 

 

5 

indices  covering  the  years  1900-1986  and  found  a  trend  of  deterioration  of  0.6%  per 
year. 

Reinhart and Wickham (1994) using quarterly data for the period comprising the 
years  of  1957  to  1993  indicate  that  the  weakness  in  commodity  prices  is  secular  and 
suggest the need  for primary  exporting to  focus  on diversification of  export countries. 
The authors also found evidence of greater price volatility of these products. 

Ocampo  and  Parra  (2003)  analyzed  the  evolution  of  the  terms-of-trade  of 
primary products during the twentieth century and found that although not continuous, 
there is a deterioration of up to 60% in the period. Ocampo and Parra (2010) extend the 
previous  exercise  and  examine 
the  evolution  of  prices  of  commodities  and 
manufactured  goods  since  1860.  The  authors  show  that  there  was  an  improvement  in 
terms of trade in favor of primary goods between the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
century.  However,  during  the  remainder  of  the  twentieth  century  there  has  been  a 
deterioration tendency, especially from the 1970s. In the first decade of this century it’s 
observed  an  improvement  in  terms-of-trade,  however,  by  far  it  does  not  reverse  the 
secular trend. 

Using database for the period 1900-1998, Zanias (2005) shows that the relative 
price of primary products fell to about 1/3 with structural shocks and not gradually. Two 
structural breaks, the first in 1920 and the second in 1984 are identified, leading to the 
decline in the relative prices of primary products. This suggests that the Prebisch-Singer 
thesis  about  the  direction  of  movement  in  terms-of-trade  in  the  long  run  cannot  be 
rejected.  In the same direction, Bunzel  and Vogelsang  (2005)  found empirical  support 
for the hypothesis of deterioration of the terms-of-trade using an index of net terms-of-
trade for the period 1900-1995. 

Serrano  and  Pinilla  (2011)  analyzed  the  evolution  of  the  terms-of-trade  of 
agricultural  products  and  food  for  56  internationally  tradable  in  the  second  half  of  the 
twentieth  century.  Using  a  new  method  for  econometric  time  series,  structural  breaks 
were  analyzed  in  non-stationary  series.  It  is  found  that  in  general,  the  less  processed 
products  suffered  a  sharp  fall  in  real  prices,  much  more  than  recorded  in  aggregated 
indices.  Only  products  with  high  income  elasticity  or  difficulty  to  be  replaced  by 
synthetic had an improvement in terms-of-trade. The evidence presented also supports a 
deterioration in stages rather than continuous. 

Mollic et al (2008) evaluated the relative prices of primary products in the U.S. 
economy and observed a significant negative trend between 1947-1998. The authors do 
not  only  find  that  the  international  evidence  supports  the  Prebisch-Singer  hypothesis, 
but  also  that,  assuming  globalization  makes  economies  more  similar  to  the  U.S.,  the 
deterioration persists and it is not likely to be reversed by economic integration. 

In  an  ambitious  effort  Harvey  et  al  (2010)  constructed  a  panel  formed  by  25 
primary  commodity  prices  since  1650  to  test  the  presence  of  a  linear  trend  with 
structural break. Prices of eleven products showed robust evidence of a deterioration in 
relation  to  manufacturing. Commodities such as coffee showed deterioration  of 0.77% 
per  annum  for  approximately  300  years.  The  authors’  conclusion  is  that  the  empirical 
evidence  supports  the  Prebisch-Singer  hypothesis.  Finally,  Arezki  et  al  (2013)  re-
examined the behavior of prices of 25 primary commodities in relation to manufactured 
using  series  from  the  seventeenth  century.  The  results  pointed  to  the  existence  of  a 
negative  trend  in  the  terms-of-trade  against  primary  commodities.  Furthermore,  it  is 
found that primary prices are more volatile and that its volatility has increased in recent 
years. 

This  section  was  dedicated  to  the  presentation  of  the  main  guidelines  of 
ECLAC’s  structuralist  thought  and  central  points  of  the  work  of  Raúl  Prebisch.  As

shown, there is a clear concern about the relationship between economic growth and the 
trade balance performance through income elasticities and prices. Special attention was 
given  to  the  empirical  evidence  that  supports  the  Prebisch-Singer’s  views  of 
deterioration  in  terms-of-trade  since  it  seems  to  have  been  ignored  by  much  of  the 
growth  literature.  This  marginalization  seems  a  misnomer  considering  the  abundant 
empirical support existent in its favor, though not in its original terms. 

3.  Thirlwall’s model and its main developments 
The  emphasis  in  demand  as  an  engine  of  economic  system  while  differences  in 
growth rates between countries would be the result of differences in its pace of growth 
is  not  new  in  the  literature,  being  crafted  by  renowned  economists  such  as  Kaldor, 
Prebisch,  McCombie  and  Thirlwall.  The  Keynesian  tradition  believes  that  the  demand 
side  matters  in  determining  the  growth  trajectory  of  the  economy  both  short-term  and 
long-term (Libânio, 2009). 

The  fundamental  hypothesis  of  the  BOPC  growth  models  is  that  the  balance  of 
payments  in  the  long  run  should  be  balanced.  Faced  with  the  impossibility  of 
continually  funding  the  imbalances  in  the  balance  of  payments,  an  adjustment  in 
aggregate demand occurs that restricts its expansion and consequently its growth as well 
(Setterfield,  2011;  McCombie  2011  Romero, Silveira  and  Jayme  Jr.,  2011).  Growth  is 
demand-led in the sense that any effect of the supply side is necessarily mediated by a 
specific effect on income elasticity of the demand (Cimoli and Porcile 2013). 

As  an  economy  grows  the  demand  for  imports  also  accompanies  this  expansion. 
This  increase in  imports is  financed  by an increase of exports or  by capital  inflows. If 
the  exports  growth  rate,  which  depends  on  foreign  income,  cannot  follow  the  imports 
growth rate, their difference must be filled via external financing. However, the inability 
to  finance  such  deficits  indefinitely  causes  an  adjustment  in  the  real  economy  by 
restricting  the  output  growth  rate.  The  balance  of  payments  sets  a  limit  to  the  pace  of 
demand limiting consequently the growth of the economy. 

In this study we assume that, for most countries, a major constraint to  growth is in 
the  balance  of  payments  because  it  determines  the  limit  of  growth  in  demand  that 
supply  can  adapt  (Thirlwall  and  Hussain,  1982;  Alonso  and  Garcimartín,  1999; 
Thirlwall, 2011). However, following the heterodox tradition of the post-Keynesian and 
ECLAC’s thought, we recognize that the performance of BP and the pattern of foreign 
trade specialization depend on structural factors historically determined (Bielschowsky, 
2009). 

The  canonical  model  of  Thirlwall  (1979)  assumes  that  the  performance  of  the 
balance  of  payments  equals  the  trade  balance.  Thus  we  can  summarize  it  in  three 
equations: 

 

𝑋 =  1/𝐸 𝜑 𝑍𝛷                                                                                         (3.1a)
  
𝑀 =  𝐸 𝛽 𝑌𝜋                                                                                               (3.1b)
𝑋 = 𝐸𝑀                                                                                                      (3.1c)

Where 𝑋 is exports, 𝑀 imports, 𝑍 world income, 𝑌 is the domestic income and 𝐸 is the 
real  exchange  rate.  Finally  𝜑,  𝛽<  0  and  𝛷,  𝜋>  0  correspond  to  the  price-demand 
elasticity and income-demand elasticity  for exports and imports respectively. Equation 
(3.1c)  gives  us  the  condition  of  equilibrium  in  BP.  Taking  logarithms  and  deriving  in 
time: 

 

𝑥  = −𝜑 𝑒   + 𝛷𝑧                                                                                         (3.2a)
  
𝑚  = 𝛽 𝑒   + 𝜋𝑦                                                                                            (3.2b)
𝑥  = 𝑒  + 𝑚                                                                                                      (3.2c)

Where ^ characterizes the variation rate of each variable. 

 

7 

Substituting (3.2a) and (3.2b) into (3.2) and isolating 𝑦  we obtain the growth rate 

compatible with equilibrium in the balance of payments: 

𝑦  =

− 1 + 𝜑 + 𝛽 𝑒  + 𝛷𝑧 

𝜋

                                                                          (3.3) 

Then taking as true the purchasing power parity (PPP), we obtain the simple rule 

of Thirlwall: 
𝛷
𝜋

𝑦  =

𝑧                                                                                                             (3.4) 

Considering equation (3.4), the long-term growth is directly proportional to the 
variation  of  foreign  income  and  the  ratio  between  income  elasticity  of  exports  and 
imports. The growth of domestic income is restricted by the income elasticity of imports 
to the extent that there is a limit supply of foreign exchange with  which this economy 
can  count  on  to  satisfy  their  needs  of  imports.  This  means  that  the  higher  the  ratio  of 
income  elasticity  of  foreign  trade  is,  the  smaller  the  constraint  growth  will  be.  In 
primary-exporting  economies,  the  growth  trend  is  smaller  than  in  industrialized 
countries to the extent that this ratio is lower for the first (Gouvêa and Lima, 2010). The 
income  gap  between  developed  and  underdeveloped  countries  derives  from  this 
restriction. 

Looking  to  incorporate  the  "structural  change"  element  to  the  original  model, 
Araujo and Lima (2007) derived from a passinettian multi-sectoral approach the growth 
rate  compatible  with  equilibrium  in  BP.  The  final  expression  obtained,  and  that  was 
known  as  Thirlwall’s  multi-sectoral  law,  indicates  that  the  income  growth  rate  is 
directly proportional to the growth rate of foreing income weighted by the ratio between 
the  income-sectoral  demand  elasticities  of  exports  and  imports.  Mathematically  we 
have: 

𝑦  =

  𝜃𝑥,𝑛 𝛷𝑛
  𝜃𝑚 ,𝑛 𝜋𝑛

𝑛
𝑖=1
𝑛
𝑖=1

𝑧                                                                                        (3.5) 

Where  𝜃𝑥 ,𝑝  and  𝜃𝑚 ,𝑝   correspond  to  each  sector’s  share  in  total  exports  and  imports, 
respectively. Even though the growth of the rest of the world is near zero, the transfer of 
workers  from  lower  income  elasticity  sectors  to  greater  elasticity  sectors  helps  to 
increase  the  rate  of  growth  compatible  with  BP  equilibrium.  Changes  in  demand 
components alter sectors’ share in foreign trade and has significant impact on growth. 

The  formulation  originally  developed  by  Thirlwall  also  evolved  to  incorporate 
other elements of the balance of payments. Thirlwall and Hussain (1982) and Moreno-
Brid  (2003)  added  capital  flows  while  Alleyne  and  Francis  (2008)  added  the  account 
transfers. While recognizing the importance of their work, for the sake of simplicity we 
will  limit  ourselves  in  our  modeling  exercise  to  the  equivalence  between  the  trade 
balance and balance of payments. 

In terms of empirical support, Thirlwall’s law has found wide acceptance, which 
has  allowed  it  to  be  consolidated  in  the  post-Keynesian  literature  growth.  Thilrwall 
(1979) tested his formulation for the period 1953-1976 in a sample of 18 countries. The 
author found estimates for the growth rates consistent with the actual growth rates. 

Thirlwall and Hussain (1982), knowing the importance that financial flows have 
on developing economies, extended the original exercise incorporating financial flows. 
They used a sample of 15 countries from 1951 to 1969. The conclusion of their analysis 
indicates that the movement of capital was significant in determining the rate of growth 
compatible with equilibrium in BP. Moreover, it is found that changes in relative prices 
were statistically significant for some countries in the sample. 

On the other hand, Alonso and Garcimartín (1999), using data for a group of 10 
OECD countries between 1965 to 1994, showed that the law of Thirlwall is supported 

 

8 

empirically  although  relative  prices  have  no  significant  role  in  terms  of  economic 
growth. The results corroborate the Keynesian position with no significant evidence of 
adjustment in prices. 

Romero,  Silveira  and  Jayme  Jr.  (2011)  find  that  the  Thirlwall’s  model  in  its 
simple and multi-sectoral version successfully  explains Brazil's economic growth over 
the past fifty years. The authors employ three distinct estimation methods for the years 
1962-2007.  Gouvea  and  Lima  (2010)  tested  the  Thirlwall’s  multi-sectoral  law  for  a 
sample of 8 countries, 4 Asian and 4  Latin American between 1962 and 2006, finding 
that we cannot reject the hypothesis that growth  in this countries is constrained by the 
balance of payments. 

Using  larger  samples  Cimoli,  Porcile  and  Rovira  (2010)  conducted  an 
econometric  exercise  verifying  the  applicability  of  Thirlwall’s  law  to  29  countries,  8 
Latin  Americans,  15  OECD  members  and  6  Asians.  The  reporting  period  covers  the 
years from 1961 to 2004. Besides the support found in favor of Thirlwall’s formulation, 
it is shown that the evolution of imports and exports elasticities in Latin American and 
Asian countries are able to explain the divergent trajectory of their per capita incomes. 

Finally, Gouvea and Lima (2013) tested the multi-sectoral version of Thirlwall's 
law for a sample of 90 economies between 1965 and 1999. The predictive power of the 
model  is  tested  by  comparing  the  expected  growth  rate  with  the  actual  growth  rate. 
Although,  as  expected,  not  all  countries  are  restricted  by  the  balance  of  payments, 
"Curve 45" cannot be rejected at a significance level of 5%, which supports the law. 

Even though apparently he developed his model independently, Thirlwall (1983) 
mentions  the  similarities  between  his  formulation  and  the  Prebisch’s  one.  However, 
unlike  Thirwall’s  generalization,  Prebisch  argued  that  BP  constraints  on  growth  were 
imposed only  on the most peripheral  and not  on  the center  countries  (Boianovsky  and 
Solís,  2014).  McCombie  (2011)  recognizes  that  the  less  developed  countries  are  more 
likely  to  have  their  growth  constrained  by  the  balance  of  payments,  however  this 
condition is not exclusive. 

By  assuming  PPP,  Thirlwall  disregards  the  effects  of  prices  on  income  in  the 
long  run.  Whereas  Thirlwall  in  Thirlwall  and  Bergevin  (1985)  finds  evidence  for  a 
deterioration  of  terms-of-trade  of  primary  products  relative  to  manufactured  goods, 
remains our questioning  of why it has not  been included  yet  in  the model.  In the next 
section  we  will  present  a  proposal  for  reconciling  the  Prebisch-Singer  thesis  and 
Thirlwall’s law. 

4.  Conciliating Prebisch-Singer and Thirlwall 
As  anticipated  in  the  general  introduction,  the  considerations  in  this  section  deal 
with  our  proposal  to  deepen  the  relationship  between  the  ECLAC  School  and  post-
Keynesian approach through the work of Prebisch and Thirlwall. As argued by Cimoli, 
Porcile  and  Rivera  (2010),  the  BOPC  growth  models  can  be  used  to  capture  key 
economic insights of both Keynesian and structuralist traditions. 

In  the  post-Keynesian  literature,  Block  and  Sapsford  (2000)  and  Sarkar  (2001) 
developed models  compatible with  the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis, but  independent  of 
BOPC literature. In the other hand, Dutt (2003) and Ros (2013) studied the dynamics of 
the  terms-of-trade  using  North-South  models  and  the  traditional  definition  for  the 
exchange rate. Both authors analyze the possibility of a continuous deterioration of the 
terms-of-trade  caused  by  the  differences  in  the  income  elasticities  of  foreign  trade.  A 
similar  exercise  has  been  done  by  Araújo  (2013)  using  a  pasinettian  approach.  Our 
proposal  consists  in  introducing  the  Prebisch-Singer  hypothesis  through  an  alternative 
definition  for  the  real  exchange  rate.  The  deterioration  of  the  terms-of-trade  will  be 
characterized by structural breaks and will depend of the rate of change of the markup

over prices, as we will show further.In his original work, Thirlwall uses a function for 
the  real  exchange  rate  compatible  with  the  PPP  such  that  while   1 + 𝜑 + 𝛽   captures 
the so called Marshall-Lerner condition, 𝑒  corresponds to changes in the real exchange 
rate  and  would  be  zero  in  the  long  term.  In  fact  both,  Thirlwall  and  the  authors  that 
succeed him, define the real exchange rate as: 

𝐸 =

𝑃𝑓𝜀
𝑃𝑑

                                                                                                         (4.1) 

Where 𝑃𝑑  corresponds to the domestic price level, 𝑃𝑓  is the level of foreign prices and 𝜀 
is the nominal exchange rate. 

Araújo (2013) argues that the PPP would not be the most convenient setting to 
study  the  effect  of  changes  in  relative  prices  on  growth.  According  to  Rogoff  (1996), 
even if we accept the parity of purchasing power, it seems to hold only in the very long-
term  at  a rate of extremely slow convergence.  Apart from  occurring only in very long 
periods - over 50 years - the relationship between the Kaldor-Verdoorn and Thirlwall’s 
law  only  has  validity  if  we  do  not  accept  PPP.  Moreover  and  for  the  purposes  of  this 
study,  the  adoption  of  purchasing  power  parity  cannot  capture  the  Prebisch-Singer 
thesis  of  deteriorating  of  terms-of-trade.  In  this  direction,  the  definition  proposed  by 
Rodrik (2008) seems to be more appropriate. Be: 

𝐸 =

𝑃𝑇
𝑃𝑁

                                                                                                              (4.2) 

where 𝐸 is the real exchange rate, 𝑃𝑇 is given by the prices of tradable goods and 𝑃𝑁 for 
non-tradable  goods.  As  shown  by  Rodrik  (2008)  this  definition  is  consistent  with  the 
Balassa-Samuelson effect and will be used in the modeling approach presented2. 

We  consider  then  an  economy  consisting  of  three  sectors  corresponding  to  the 
production  of  primary  goods  (sector  1,  tradable),  industrial  goods  (sector  2,  tradable) 
and  services  (sector  3,  non-tradable).  The  real  exchange  rate  can  be  represented  as 
follows: 

𝐸 =

𝜃2
𝜃1 𝑃𝑇,2
𝑃𝑇,1
𝑃𝑁

                                                                                                     (4.3) 

Where  𝑃𝑇,1  corresponds  to  prices  in  the  primary  sector,  𝑃𝑇,2  is  given  by  prices  in  the 
industrial  sector  and  𝑃𝑁  in  the  services  sector.  In  turn,  𝜃1 + 𝜃2 = 1   determine  the 
weight  of  each  sector  in  total  tradable  production  and  are  taken  at  the  beginning  as 
constants.  Gains  of  productivity  in  the  tradable  sector  lead  to  lower  prices,  which  in 
turn, are reflected in a more appreciated exchange rate. In turn, gains of productivity in 
the  service  sector  have  the  opposite  effect,  devaluing  the  real  exchange  rate.  The 
validity of Balassa-Samuelson effect  implies that the increase in productivity levels  of 
tradable sectors is higher than in the non-tradable. The rate of change of the exchange 
rate is given by: 

𝑒  = 𝜃1𝑝𝑇,1  + 𝜃2𝑝𝑇,2  − 𝑝𝑁  
Following Porcile and Lima (2006), let prices be determined in industrial sector 
by  a  mark-up  that  captures  the  market  power  of  firms.  The  other  sectors  operate  in  a 
competitive market. Then:

−1                                                                                              (4.5b)
−1                                                                                                  (4.5c)

                                                           
2 The Balassa-Samuelson effect postulates that productivity gains are larger in the tradable sector than in 
the  non-tradable.  A  related  effect  of  this  prediction  is  that  countries  with  higher  growth  rates  will 
experience greater exchange appreciation. As we show below, this is not necessarily true. 

10 

 

Market  power  in  the  manufacturing  sector  is  represented  by  𝜏 > 0,  and  we 
consider  that  it  is  intrinsic  to  the  very  structure  of  this  market,  regardless  if  it  is 
operating in monopolistic or oligopolistic competition. We observed that the mark-up is 
derived  from  the  presence  of  a  greater  bargaining  power  by  workers  and  the 
concentration  of  innovation  in  the  industrial  sector.  Workers  of  the  industrial  sector 
seem  to  be  organized  in  trade  unions  and  are  in  a  better  position  to  seek  wage 
improvements  as  described  by  Prebisch.  Moreover,  as  shown  by  Singer,  when  a 
company  innovates,  it  gains  the  right  to  charge  a  mark-up  on  prices.  Finally,  𝑤 
corresponds to the nominal wage and 𝑞 to labor productivity. 
 

Taking logarithms of equations (4.5a), (4.5b) and (4.5c) and deriving in time: 

 

𝑝𝑇,1  = 𝑤  − 𝑞𝑇,1                                                                                          (4.6a)
𝑝𝑇,2  = 𝜏  + 𝑤  − 𝑞𝑇,2                                                                                   (4.6b)
𝑝𝑁  = 𝑤  − 𝑞𝑁                                                                                              (4.6c)

  

Thus,  we  obtain  the  prices  change  rate  function  of  our  economy.  Increases  of 
productivity lead to reductions in prices while wage increases have the opposite effect. 
In  the  industrial  sector,  a  higher  rate  of  innovation  or  bargaining  power  of  workers 
causes an increase in 𝜏  resulting in higher prices. The rate of change of the mark-up can 
be modeled by a unit step function where: 

𝜏  =  

ℎ𝑞𝑇,2  , higher inovation rate or increase in workers bargaining power
  

0, otherwise

Following Ferrari, Freitas and Barbosa Filho (2013), we reconstruct the original 

system of Thirlwall's model for our economy as follows: 

𝑋𝑇,𝑖 =  1/𝐸 𝜑 𝑇,𝑖 𝑍𝛷𝑇,𝑖                                                                            (4.7a)
𝑀𝑇,𝑖 =  𝐸 𝛽𝑇,𝑖𝑌𝜋𝑇,𝑖                                                                                 (4.7b)

In  which  the  export  and  import  function  and  the  equilibrium  condition  were 
disaggregated in two sectors so 𝑋 = 𝑋𝑇,1 + 𝑋𝑇,2 and 𝑀 = 𝑀𝑇,1 + 𝑀𝑇,2 with i = 1, 2. 
 

With the same tools used up to here we obtain: 
𝑥 𝑇,𝑖 = −𝜑𝑇,𝑖𝑒  + 𝛷𝑇,𝑖𝑧                                                                                (4.8a)
𝑚  𝑇,𝑖 = 𝛽𝑇,𝑖𝑒  + 𝜋𝑇,𝑖𝑦                                                                                   (4.8b)
𝛼1𝑥 𝑇,1 + 𝛼2𝑥 𝑇,2 = 𝑒  + 𝛾1𝑚  𝑇,1 + 𝛾2𝑚  𝑇,2                                              (4.8c)

 

  

Where parameters 𝛼 and 𝛾 correspond to the weight of each sector in total exports and 
imports, respectively (𝛼1 + 𝛼2 = 1 and 𝛾1 + 𝛾2 = 1). 

Substituting (4.8a) and (4.8b) in (4.8c) and isolating 𝑦  we obtain the growth rate 

compatible with equilibrium in the balance of payments: 

𝑦  = −

Looking  for  the  reconciling  ECLAC’s  vision  with  the  propositions  made  by 
Setterfield (2011) and Araujo (2013), we replace the definition of real exchange adopted 
by Thirlwall (1979) by the one adopted by Rodrik (2008) and previously modified (see

However,  we  know  from  system  (4.6)  which  is  the  behavior  of  prices  in  each

We  obtain  a  version  of  Thirlwall’s  law  compatible  with  the  structural  change 
and the possibility of deterioration in terms-of-trade. Similarly to the original model, the 
growth  rate  that  leads  to  the  equilibrium  of  the  balance  of  payments  is  directly 
proportional  to  the  growth  rate  of  foreign  income  and  the  ratio  between  exports  and 
imports  elasticities.  Thus,  the  more  the  international  product  grows  the  bigger  the 
domestic potential growth will be. Moreover, countries specialized in the production of 
industrial  goods  present  higher  growth  than  the  rest  of  the  world  due  to  the  higher 
income  elasticity  of  exports  to  the  detriment  of  imports.  On  the  other  hand,  primary 
exporting  countries  tend  to  grow  more  slowly  than  the  rest  of  the  world  since  the 
elasticity of exports is lower than that of imports. 

The model also does not exclude the possibility of structural change. In fact we 

have as in equation (2.1):

 𝛷  =   𝛼𝑖𝛷𝑇,𝑖
 

                                                                                      (4.12a)

Where 𝛷  and 𝜋  correspond to  average elasticities of exports and imports respectively.

Technical progress is able to modify the income elasticities, process captured by 
the second component of the system above. In turn, the transfer of workers from sectors 
with  lower  to  higher  income  elasticity  also  can  contribute  to  modify  the  potential 
growth rate, as shown by the first component. Even in an adverse external environment, 
changes  in  the  proportion  of  each  sector  in  the  economy  allow  to  achieve  different 
growth rates. 

Not  assuming  PPP  and  taking  the  Marshall-Lerner  condition  as  valid,  our 
formulation is  compatible with  the ample evidence presented in  favor of  the Prebisch-
Singer  hypothesis  of  deterioration  of  terms-of-trade.  Productivity  gains  resulting  from 
the process of economic growth naturally lead to an appreciation of the exchange rate, 
via  Balassa-Samuelson  effect,  which  reduces  the  growth  rate  consistent  with 
equilibrium  in  the  balance  of  payments.  However,  technical  progress  and  market 
structure  in  the  industrial  sector  can  simultaneously  reduce  the  intensity  of  the 
appreciation via mark-up. As the R&D is concentrated in sector 2, countries specialized 
in  the  production  of  sector  1  present  a  greater  constraint  to  growth  due  to  the 
appreciation of the real exchange rate. Note, however, that as we modeled 𝜏  as a scalar 
unit function, the variation does not occur continuously.

As  an  example,  consider  the  extreme  cases  of  a  central  and  a  peripheral 
economy  fully  specialized  in  the  production  of  industrialized  and  primary  goods, 
respectively.  In  the  first  case,  the  sector  2  is  responsible  for  the  entire  production  of 
tradable  goods  (𝜃2 = 1).  Thus,  the  growth  rate  consistent  with  balance  of  payments 
constraint is equal to: 

𝑦  =

− 1 + 𝜑𝑇,2 + 𝛽𝑇,1 [(𝜏  − 𝑞𝑇,2  ) + 𝑞𝑁 ]

𝜋𝑇,1

+  

𝛷𝑇,2
𝜋𝑇,1

  𝑧                      (3.14a) 

Technical progress and/or changes in the bargaining power of workers, who by 
definition  are  concentrated  in  the  industrial  sector,  allow  to  offset  the  effects  of  the 
appreciation  of  the  real  exchange  rate  through  a  variation  in  the  rate  of  mark-up. 
Although the Balassa-Samuelson effect prevails, in the long run it will be less intense. 

In the case of an economy totally specialized in the production of primary goods 

(𝜃1 = 1), the long term growth rate is given by: 

𝑦  =

− 1 + 𝜑𝑇,1 + 𝛽𝑇,2 [−𝑞𝑇,1  + 𝑞𝑁 ]

𝜋𝑇,2

+  

𝛷𝑇,1
𝜋𝑇,2

  𝑧                            (3.14b) 

As  the  market  for  primary  goods  operates  in  perfect  competition,  we  can 
consider that there is a deterioration of the terms-of-trade of primary products in relation 
to industrial products, determined by the differences in sectoral market structures. 

Productivity  gains  in  the  tradable  sector  lead,  through  prices,  to  a  reduction  in 
the  potential  growth  rate  of  the  economy  in  both  cases.  The  existence  of  oligopolized 
structures  in  the  center  countries  reduces  this  effect  via  the  mark-up  that  innovation 
itself  allows  firms  to  possess.  As  the  primary  commodity  market  approaches  a 
competitive structure, productivity gains necessarily translate into a reduction in prices, 
featuring the deterioration described by Prebisch. 

The empirical evidence supporting the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis suggests that 
the deterioration does not occur continuously, being characterized by structural breaks. 
The  model  developed  in  this  study  is  also  consistent  with  this  observation.  Indeed  the 
deterioration  of  terms-of-trade  would  be  continuous  only  if  the  rate  of  mark-up  also 
growed continuously, which is clearly not possible. However, technical  progress, from 
which the market power of firms derives, is discontinuous and to some extent the great 
innovations are unpredictable. 

At  the  moment  that  a  major  innovation  arises  or  there  is  a  shock  in  the 
bargaining  power  of  workers,  it  is  observed  an  increase  in  𝜏   that  causes  a  sharp 
deterioration in the terms-of-trade of primary products, featuring the observed structural 
breaks. A period of relative price stability  follows for both sectors. Ocampo and Parra 
(2003),  Zanias  (2005)  and  Ocampo  and  Parra  (2010)  identify  two  major  structural 
breaks  during  the  twentieth  century,  the  first  around  1920  and  the  second  during  the 
1980s,  as  can  be  seen  in  figure  4.1.  In  the  light  of  the  presented  model,  there  were 
effectively two shocks on mark-up rate. 
We  suggest  that  the  first  shock  is  related  not  only  to  the  end  of  the  1st  World 
 
War, but also to the rise of the Soviet bloc. At that time it rose the terms of bargaining 
for workers in the center countries. The Russian Revolution of 1917 granted to Western 
Europe workers a significant increase in bargaining power taking in consideration that it 
raised entrepreneurs’ fears of a revolution in their own countries. The second and more 
recent  structural  break would  be linked to  the beginning of the computer revolution,  a 
true  technology  shock.  The  leading  economies  of  this  industry  remained  an  important 
market power in the years that followed its dissemination.

The  two  main  variables  behind  the  long-term  growth  rate  remain  the 
international growth and the ratio of the income elasticity of exports and imports. They 
are in fact the determinants of long-term growth  and override the effect of prices. The 
approach  presented,  however,  adds  a  new  element  in  this  framework  by  allowing  the 
capture  of  the  effect  of  prices  on  growth  from  the  Prebisch-Singer  hypothesis  of 
deterioration of terms-of-trade for primary products in relation to manufactured goods. 
We call the final expression denoted by equation (4.11) the Prebisch-Thirlwall rule. 

5.  Cumulative causation and the Prebisch-Thirlwall rule 
The  post-Keynesian  literature  has  developed  two  different  models  of  long-term 
growth for open economies, namely the cumulative causation model originally designed 
by  Nicholas  Kaldor  (Kaldor,  1966)  and  the  balance-of-payments-constrained  already 
presented in the third section. Although both approaches differ significantly in some of 
its  hypotheses  (Blecker,  2009),  important  insights  can  be  extracted  from  their 
combination3. 
 
defined in (4.12a) and (4.12b) we find:

𝑖=12𝛼𝑖𝜑𝑇,𝑖+𝑖=12𝛾𝑖𝛽𝑇,𝑖>0. 

As argued by Araújo (2013) and Romero, Silveira and Jayme Jr. (2011), income 
elasticities  are  determined  by  technological  intensity  of  domestic  production.  Thus, 
technologically leading industries would present a greater income elasticity of demand. 
Then, following Setterfield (2011), let’s consider the average elasticities as a function of 
the productivity growth of the tradable sector so that: 

𝛷𝑇    
𝜋𝑇    

= 𝑘𝑞𝑇                                                                                                     (5.2a) 

Where 𝑘 > 0 is a linear parameter that captures the sensitivity of elasticities to changes 
in productivity growth rate. Countries specialized in the production of industrial goods 
of high technological intensity tend to have a high k. That contrasts with technologically 
backward countries which present a lower k. The pattern of specialization in world trade 
determines how the fruits of technical progress shall be divided between countries. 

                                                           
3The Dixon-Thirlwall model corresponds to a formalization of the Kaldorian vision applied  to a regional 
economy context.

The  mark-up  growth  rate  has  been  previously  modeled  by  a  unit  step  function 
linearly dependent on the industrial productivity growth rate. For the sake of simplicity, 
in this representation it will depend only on the tradable productivity growth rate. Being 
productivity  gains  concentrated  in  this  sector  we  can  also  write  the  non-tradable 
productivity growth rate in a similar way. So, we have: 
𝜏  = ℎ𝑞𝑇  
𝑞𝑁  = 𝑙𝑞𝑇  
With ℎ > 0 corresponding to the sensitivity of the mark-up to variations in productivity 
and  0 < 𝑙 < 1  is  the  ratio  of  innovation  of  the  non-tradable  sector  in  relation  to  the 
tradable one.

Replacing the system formed by equations (5.2) in (5.1) and after some algebraic 
manipulations  we  get  our  growth  rate  compatible  with  equilibrium  in  the  balance  of 
payments.  Joining  this  result  with  the  Kaldor-Verdoorn  law  we  have  our  system  of 
cumulative causation: 

 

𝑦  = Ω1𝑞𝑇  + Ω2𝑞𝑇 2                                                                                   (5.3a)

Elaborate by the authors 
 
Some  important  insights  can  be  extracted  from  the  model  presented.  The  first 
suggests  that  the  output  growth  rate  depends  quadratically  on  the  productivity  growth 
rate. BP curve is formed by all combinations of 𝑞𝑇  and 𝑦  that maintain the balance of 
payments in equilibrium. Economies whose equilibrium is found before the  parabola’s 
vertex  of  the  BP  regime  show  a  positive  relation  between  the  endogenous  variables. 
Productivity shocks that move RP to the right raises the output growth rate that balances 
BP. Moreover, economies whose equilibrium is after BP vertex have a negative relation 
between  the  endogenous  variables.  Thus,  positive  productivity  shocks  have  a  negative 
effect on growth rate, since the price effect begins to overlap the income effect. 
In turn, the productivity  growth rate depends directly on the output growth rate 
 
through  Kaldor-Verdoorn  mechanism.  In  other  words, 
the  external  constraint 
determines the changes in  productivity. We argue that countries with  high  k and 𝜁1are 
the most likely to get into virtuous circles of growth. Analogously, the combination of a 
low k and 𝜁1 implies a greater propensity to indulge in vicious circles of growth. 

 

15 

The  two  main  variables  behind  the  long-term  growth  rate  remain  the 
 
international growth and the ratio between the income elasticity of exports and imports. 
Those  are  in  fact  the  determinants  of  long-term  growth,  which  means  that  the  income 
effect  overlaps  extensively  the  price  effect.  The  model  remains  compatible  with  the 
structural change since both, technical progress and the transfer of workers from sectors 
with  lower  to  higher  income  elasticity,  are  able  to  change  the  average  elasticity  of 
foreign  trade  and  therefore  modify  the  growth  rate.  The  approach  presented  is  still 
compatible  with  the  Prebisch-Singer  hypothesis  of  deterioration  of  terms-of-trade  of 
primary products in relation to manufactured goods. 
 
As  an  example,  let  us  consider  the  extreme  cases  of  a  central  and  a  peripheral 
economy,  fully  specialized  in  the  production  of  industrial  and  primary  goods, 
respectively. In the first case there is a combination of a high Ω1 and 𝜁1 and a low Ω2. 
The  high  Ω1  occurs  because  the  center  countries  are  exporters  of  technologically 
advanced  products  with  high  income  elasticity  and  import  primary  inputs  of  lower 
income elasticity. The high 𝜁1 is also guaranteed by the technological leadership of the 
center  which  gives  them  more  advanced  educational  and  research  systems  as  well  as 
major  consumer  markets.  Finally,  the  low  Ω2  comes  not  only  through  a  high  income 
elasticity  of  exports  (see  denominator  of  the  expression)  but  also  for  the  presence  of 
market power in the industrial sector. 
The periphery presents, in turn, a combination of low Ω1 and 𝜁1and high Ω2.The 
 
low Ω1 occurs because a primary export economy is an importer of manufactured goods 
with high income elasticity and whose exports have low income elasticity. The reduced 
𝜁1  comes  from  its  technological  backwardness,  giving  them  fragile  educational  and 
research systems and smaller consumer markets. Finally, the highest Ω2 comes not only 
through a low income elasticity of exports (see denominator of the expression) but also 
for the absence of market power in the industrial sector. 
 
Comparing the curves of the productivity regime and the BP regime between the 
center  and  the  periphery  allows  us  to  notice  that  the  growth  rate  that  balances  the 
balance  of  payments  is  higher  in  the  first  than  in  the  latter.  It  can  be  seen  in  graphic 
5.2b.  The  RPI  and  BPI  curves  correspond  to  the  productivity  and  the  balance  of 
payments  regimes,  respectively,  in  the  central  country.  Similarly,  the  RPP  and  BPP 
curves  correspond  to  the  productivity  and  the  balance  of  payments  regimes, 
respectively, in the peripheral country. The growth rate in the center will be higher via 
prices,  due  to  the  presence  of  the  mark-up  factor,  and  mainly  due  to  differences  in 
income  elasticities  whose  effect  is  captured  by  the  Ω1(𝑘)  parameter.  As  explained 
above, in industrialized countries, k is greater than in the primary exporting countries. 

As  described  by  Prebisch  (1959),  positive  productivity  shocks  in  peripheral 
economies are not reflected in increases in the growth rate and only generate a transfer 
of the fruits of technical progress to the center. In fact, for a shift to the right of the RPp 
curve  there  is  a  reduction  in  the  output  growth  rate.  In  terms  of  economic  policy,  it 
would be advisable to increase the slope of RP and shift the BP curve up, thus relieving 
the external constraint. 

If  a  developing  country  promotes  its  industry  with  an  export  focus,  it  not  only 
will  be  able  to  raise  its  output  growth  rate  but  also  increase  the  growth  rate  of 
productivity.  This  can  be  seen  through  the  BP  curve  shifts  vertically  and  helps  to 
explains the differences in growth patterns between Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
While the first focused on the rise of income elasticities and made the defense of prices 
a  secondary  effort,  the  latter  devoted  greater  attention  to  the  protection  of  prices  via 
customs protectionism. As the income effect  outweighs the price effect our model can 
explain  the  lower  growth  of  output  and  productivity  in  Latin  America.  Intermediate 

 

16 

situations can be described from different combinations  of Ω1, 𝜁1 and Ω2 and likewise 
also be used to explain the behavior of some exceptions to the classic center-periphery 
dynamic described by ECLAC authors. 

6.  Conclusion 
This  paper  reviewed  the  basic  BOPC  growth  model  and  its  main  developments 
suggesting  that  Thirlwall's  law  can  be  understood  as  a  mathematical  formalization  of 
ECLAC’s thinking derived from Prebisch rule. Our major contribution is at the junction 
of  the  Prebisch-Singer  hypothesis,  the  Thirlwall’s  law  and  the  cumulative  mechanism 
through a distinct approach. 
 
Assuming an economy consisting of three sectors - manufactured goods, primary 
goods  and  services  –  we  derive  Thirlwall's  law  using  a  distinct  definition  for  the  real 
exchange  rate,  inconsistent  with  PPP  and  compatible  with  the  Balassa-Samuelson 
effect. We call the final expression obtained the Prebisch-Thirlwall rule. 
 
Technical  progress  -  that  by  definition  focuses  on  the  industrial  sector  -  and 
shocks in the bargaining power of workers decrease the effects of the appreciation of the 
real exchange rate through the market power that innovation gives to innovating firms. 
Although the Balassa-Samuelson effect prevails, in the long run it will be less intense in 
the central than in the peripheral economy. 
As  the  primary  goods  market  operates  in  perfect  competition,  we  can  consider 
 
that  there  is  a  deterioration  in  the  terms-of-trade  of  primary  products  in  relation  to 
industrial  products,  determined  by  the  difference  in  sectoral  market  structures.  This 
deterioration has negative repercussions on the growth rate compatible with equilibrium 
in  the  balance  of  payments  of  the  primary-exporting  economies,  reinforcing  its 
peripheral position. 
 
Our  model  is  also  consistent  with  the  conclusions  of  Thirlwall’s  multi-sectoral 
law.  In  fact,  the  two  main  variables  behind  the  long-term  growth  rate  remain  the 
international growth and the ratio between the income elasticity of exports and imports. 
Thus,  industrial  economies  will  potentially  grow  above  the  rest  of  the  world  since  the 
elasticity  of  exports  is  superior  to  the  imports.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  expected  the 
opposite  effect  on  primary-exporting  economies.  In  terms  of  structural  change,  the 
transfer of workers from the primary sector to the industrial one contributes positively 
to growth via changes in the composition of the foreign trade elasticities. 
 
The presented approach adds a third element in this framework by allowing the 
capture  of  the  effect  of  prices  on  growth  via  the  Prebisch-Singer  hypothesis  of 
deterioration  of  the  terms-of-trade  of  primary  products  in  relation  to  manufactured 
goods. Empirical  evidence suggests that this deterioration does not  occur continuously 
but  staggered  through  structural  breaks.  The  constructed  model  is  consistent  with  this 
observation. The deterioration of the terms of trade would only be continued if the mark 
up  growth  rate  also  grew  continuously.  However,  technical  progress  -  from  which  the 
market  power  of  firms  derive  -  and  changes  in  the  pattern  of  distributive  conflict  are 
discontinuous. At the moment that a major innovation appears there is an increase in 𝜏  
that causes a sharp deterioration in terms-of-trade, characterizing the observed structural 
breaks. A period of relative price stability follows for both sectors. 
We  also  present  a  proposal  for  a  joint  between  BOPC  growth  model  and  the 
 
post-Keynesian tradition of cumulative causation. It is found that the output growth rate 
depends quadratically on the productivity growth rate. In turn, productivity growth rate 
depends directly on output growth rate through Kaldor-Verdoorn mechanism. In terms 
of economic policy, if a developing country promotes its industry with an export focus, 
it  is  not  only  able  to  raise  its  growth  rate  but  also  to  increase  the  growth  rate  of 
productivity. Our findings reinforce the settings originally made by ECLAC authors.
