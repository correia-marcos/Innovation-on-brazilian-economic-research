ABSTRACT 

 

This paper presents a simulation of the economic impacts  of medium and long term the proposed social 
security reform contained in the Proposal for Constitutional Amendment (PEC) nº 287/2016. For that, an 
overlapping  generations  (OLG)  model  with  57  generations  was  built,  including  the  transition  rule.  The 
results suggest feasible the pension reform, since, the fiscal situation becomes unsustainable. Combining 
the expansion of social security expenditures with a reduction in the labor supply, it leads the country to a 
scenario  a  sharp  fall  in  consumption  and  output  per  capita.  The  simulation  with  PEC  nº  287/2016 
indicates that, although it is not the definitive solution to the Brazilian pension issue, it allows a window 
of  about  10  to  15  years  in  which  the  social  security  deficit  stabilizes.    After  this  period,  the  situation 
worsens  once  again  with  social  security  returning  to  an  explosive  trajectory.  As  a  policy  suggestion, 
although PEC nº 287/2016 has not even been voted, the recommendation is that it represents a minimum 
level for the next pension reform.

RESUMO 

 

A  presente  pesquisa  tem  o  intuito  de  simular  os  impactos  econômicos  de  médio  e  longo  prazo  dos 
elementos principais da reforma previdenciária contida na Proposta de Emenda Constitucional (PEC) nº 
287/2016. Para isso, o método parte de um modelo de gerações sobrepostas (OLG) com 57 gerações que 
inclui a regra de transição entre o regime atual e a proposta. Os resultados sugerem factível a reforma da 
previdência, uma vez que,  situação fiscal  torna-se insustentável. Combinando  a  ampliação das despesas 
previdenciárias com redução da oferta de trabalho,  acaba por levar o país  para um  cenário de queda do 
produto  e  consumo  per  capita.  A  simulação  com  a  PEC  nº  287/2016  indica  que  ela  não  é  a  solução 
definitiva para a questão previdenciária brasileira, mas que permite uma janela de cerca de 10 a 15 anos 
em que o déficit previdenciário se estabiliza. Depois desse período a situação se agrava novamente com a 
previdência social voltando para uma trajetória explosiva. Como sugestão de política, apesar da PEC nº 
287/2016  não  ter  sido  sequer  votada,  a  recomendação  é  que  ela  represente  um  patamar  mínimo  para  a 
reforma da previdência.

INTRODUCTION 

 

The main economic challenge for Brazil today is undoubtedly Social Security. The General Social 
Security  System  (RGPS)4 presented  a  deficit  of  R  $  182  billion  and  R  $  195  billion,  2017  and  2018, 
respectively. Likewise, the Social Welfare Regime (RPPS)5 of union and military servants also presented 
a deficit of R $ 86 billion (2017) and R $ 95 billion (2018), which increases the fiscal difficulties of the 
country. In total, the Brazilian social security deficit reached R $ 268 billion in 2017 and R $ 290 billion 
in 2018. 

The  Brazilian  demographic  change  occurs  rapidly,  which  can  lead  to  an  unsustainable  social 
security situation in the long term. Data from the Social Security Forum (2016) indicate that the Brazilian 
birth rate will decrease to 1.3 children per woman in 2034. In parallel, life expectancy is expected to rise 
to 80.1 years in 2042. Thus, a Brazilian reaching 60 years will have a 25.2 year survival expectation in 
2060.  On  the  other  hand,  the  IBGE  (2014)  projects  a  reduction  of  the  economically  active  population 
from 140.9 million in 2015 to 131.4 million in 2060, with an increase in number of elderly over 65 years 
from 16.1 million to 58.4 million in the same period. 

The  result  of  this  process  is  the  widening  of  the  social  security  deficit  if  no  change  occurs.  The 
Ministério da Fazenda (2017) estimates a sharp increase in the social security deficit, which is expected to 
jump from the current 4% of GDP to above 11.1% of GDP by 2060. A deficit would make most of the 
government's most fundamental tasks such as education, health and security. 

Against  this  background,  the  federal  government  presented  the  Constitutional  Amendment 
Proposal  (PEC)  nº  287/2016  that  establishes  a  minimum  age  with  transition  rules  and  covers  both  the 
RGPS and the RPPS of the federal servers. The minimum retirement age will be 65 for men and 62 for 
women with  a transition rule of 20  years. According to  a study by the  Ministry of  Finance (2017) such 
measures would be sufficient to contain the social security deficit until at least 2060. 

The national economic literature has alerted to the Brazilian social security issue. Barreto (1997) 
already  argued that the  Brazilian social security  system was insolvent  and suggested a change from  the 
distribution system to the capitalization regime. The author builds a model of overlapping generations  - 
OLG  to  evaluate  the  effects  on  the  economy  of  change  in  the  social  security  regime.  The  impacts  are 
positive,  but  there  is  a  heavy  fiscal  cost  that  must  be  borne  during  the  transition  from  the  allocation 
system to the capitalization system. 

The  change  in  the  social  security  regime  of  capitalization  distribution  was  very  present  in  the 
Brazilian literature. Ferreira (2004) uses a OLG model to calculate the short-term and long-term effects of 
various  pension  reforms,  with  changes  in  the  choice  of  a  distribution  system,  capitalization  or 
intermediate situations. The author concludes that partial reforms that reduce the replacement rate or shift 
the tax base from work to consumption produce positive long-term effects, but a high fiscal cost remains 
in the transition. 

Ellery  and  Bugarin  (2003)  apply  an  OLG  model  to  determine  the  optimal  relation  between 
allocation  and  capitalization  system,  measured  by  the  replacement  rate.  The  authors  conclude,  for 
reasonable parameters, that the capitalization system is always preferable instead of an allocation system. 
Concern about the drop-in fertility and the increase in life expectancy already appeared in the text 
by Oliveira, Beltrão and Ferreira (1997). The authors highlighted the legislative difficulties to approve a 
social security reform that was necessary at the time. 

The  first  major  change  in  social  security  since  the  approval  of  the  Federal  Constitution  in  1988 
was  the  approval  of  Constitutional  Amendment  20/1998.  The  new  legislation  established  the  minimum 
contribution time of 35 years for men and 30 years for women and determined minimum retirement age in 
                                                           
4 It  is  the  social  security  system  that  applies  to  private  sector  employees,  employers,  salaried  employees,  domestic  workers, 
self-employed persons, individual taxpayers, rural workers, occupiers of positions of trust in public administration and public 
servants of municipalities that do not have their own social security system. 
5 It  is  the  regime  applied  to  public  servants  of  the  Union,  the  States  and  the  Federal  District  and  also  to  2,052  Brazilian 
municipalities.

the federal  public service of 60  years for men and 55  years for women.  Constitutional Amendment No. 
20/1998  created  the  social  security  factor,  together  with  the  infraconstitutional  legislation  (Law  9.876  / 
99), which made it possible to reduce the benefits amounts in the RGPS. 

According  to  Giambiagi  and  Estermínio  (2006)  and  Marques,  Batich  and  Mendes  (2003),  EC 
20/98 was only able to reduce the short-term deficit, but it did not represent a definitive solution for the 
Brazilian pension system. 

The  second  social  security  reform  was  Constitutional  Amendment  No.  41  of  2003.  EC  41/03 
created the social security  contribution of the inactive of the RPPS. Federal  retirees with  income above 
the  RGPS  benefit  ceiling  started  to  pay  the  same  social  security  contribution  as  the  assets.  New 
limitations were also established within the RPPS, such as reducing the value of the benefit for employees 
retiring before the age of 60 (male) and 55 (female). 

For Souza et al. (2006), the impact of EC 41/2003 was very limited, focusing only on RPPS whose 
implied debt fell by 20% and almost nil on the RGPS. Many authors begin to question the solvency of the 
Brazilian pension system. For Rocha and Caetano (2008) the regime presents very high expenditures in 
comparison  with  other  countries,  with  a  high  number  of  beneficiaries,  so  that  Brazilian  social  security 
expenditures  already  seemed  excessive  in  2006.  Matos,  Melo  and  Simonassi  (2013)  also  question  the 
solvency of RGPS in Brazil, but argue that reforms with the establishment of a minimum age would be 
able to reverse the trajectory of the social security deficit. 

As  a  way  of  balancing  the  social  security  regime,  Giambiagi  et  al.  (2007)  proposed  the 
establishment of a minimum age of 60  years (male) and 55  years (female) with  contribution  time of 35 
years (male) and 31 years (female) for those already in the labor market. For new entrants, establishment 
of  minimum  age  of  65  for  men  and  64  for  women,  with  contribution  time  of  40  years.  The  authors 
calculate  that  with  these  measures  the  implicit  debt  of  the  Brazilian  social  security  system  could  fall 
between 40% and 60%. 

Caetano  et  al.  (2016)  analyze  the  social  security  changes  in  Dilma  Roussef's  government, 
especially the end of the social security factor. The authors conclude that the social security  factor was 
able to generate savings of 2.2% of GDP per year, while the new rules will increase RGPS spending by 
0.4% per year. It recommends the adoption of a reform with the establishment of a minimum age of 65 
for men and 60 for women. 

This  paper  contributes  in  the  literature  by  simulating  the  economic  impacts  of  the  Proposal  for 
Constitutional  Amendment  (PEC)  nº  287/2016.  In  order  to  do  so,  an  overlapping  generations  (OLG) 
model with 57 generations will be constructed and will include the transition rule. The methodology used, 
although very common in the international literature6, is little used in Brazil.  

The results suggest  that  PEC  No. 287/2016  has relevant  effects  on the economy. Comparing the 
situation  without  reform  with  the  reform  proposed  by  PEC  287/2016,  it  can  be  observed  that  the 
macroeconomic variables perform better with the reform, with the product, consumption and employment 
reaching higher levels throughout the trajectory. However, the total social security deficit, which includes 
RGPS and RPPS, jumps from around 4.59% of GDP to 13.10% of GDP with reform and 21.65% of GDP 
without reform. The conclusion is that, from the perspective of the model, the reform of PEC 287/2016 
may help, but it is far from solving the social security deficit. 

Besides this introduction, the work counts on 5 more sections. Section 2 outlines the methodology, 
section  3  presents  the  data  and  the  calibration,  section  4  details  the  Proposals  of  Constitutional 
Amendment No. 287/2016 and section 5 discusses the results. Section 6 presents the final comments. 

 
 

2. METHODOLOGY 

This  article  uses  a  model  of  overlapping  generations  with  greater  detail  on  the  fiscal  side, 

 
approaching the real situation of the Brazilian economy.

et.al. (1995), Heer and Irmen (2014) and Fredriksen et. al. (2019).

2.1 Households 

Households comprehend 57 overlapping generations of adults. With each period of time, there is an 
exit  and  an  entrance  of  individuals.  The  entry  happens  at  the  age  of  23,  and  the  exit,  happens  with  an 
expected age of death of 80 years. The assumption is that individuals start working at age 23 (when j = 1, 
where j is the generation), retire at 587 (j = 35) and die at age 80 (j = 57). Life uncertainty was considered 
in this model when introducing the mortality rate of each family. 

For each family, we assume preferences represented by a utility function with the current and future 
values  of  consumption  and  leisure.  Leisure  is  measured  as  the  difference  between  the  fraction  of  the 
maximum  amount  of  time  that  an  individual  could  work  in  the  reference  week  having  values  between 
zero  and  one.  For  preferences,  we  use  the  constant  elasticity  of  substitution  function  (CES).  We  can 
represent the intertemporal utility function as follows:

Where    𝛾  is  the  intertemporal  substitution  elasticity,  𝛽  is  the  discount  rate,  𝑝𝑗  is  the  survival 
probability of the individual of family j (IBGE, 2017). For simplicity, the accidental inheritances left by 
individuals  are  not  used by  the  model.  The  variables 𝑐𝑗,𝑡 and 𝑙𝑗,𝑡 represent  consumption  and  leisure  with 
age j at time t. The parameter ρ represents the intratemporal substitution elasticity between consumption 
and leisure and 𝛼 is the weight of leisure in relation to the consumption in the preferences of the families. 
Given  this,  we  have  that  families  maximize  their  intertemporal  utility  based  on  their  income 

expectations throughout the life cycle, represented by the equation below:

∑ ∏ (

𝑊𝑡𝑒𝑗(1 − 𝑙𝑗,𝑡)(1 − 𝜏𝑙𝑡 − 𝜏𝑠𝑡)

(3) 

𝑗=1

The equation ensures that the present value of consumption over the life cycle is less than or equal 
to  the  present  value  of  the  income  of  individuals  during  the  finite  period of  life  of  families.  Leisure 𝑙𝑗,𝑡 
assumes values less than 1, for j between 1 and 35; and values equal to 1 for j from 36 to 57. This is due 
to the fact that retirees do not offer work (generation between 36 and 57). The wage in year t is given by 
𝑊𝑡, (1 − 𝑙𝑗,𝑡) are  hours  worked  and 𝑒𝑗 is  an  exogenous  adjustment  factor  to  capture  differences  in  skill 
levels between families of different ages. 

𝑚=1

The  tax  rates  are: 𝜏𝑙𝑡 –  tax  rate  on  labor  income, 𝜏𝑘𝑡 –  rate  on  capital  income, 𝜏𝑐𝑡 –  tax  rate  on 
consumption  and  𝜏𝑠𝑡  rate  of  social  security  contributions,  and  𝑇𝑟𝑡  are  transfers  from  government  to 
families. 

The  variable 𝑟𝑡 is  the  real  interest  rate,  while 𝑏𝑡 represents  transfers  to  families  as  social  security. 

Thus, the value of the benefit salary will be8: 

 

                                                           
7 Average age of retirement in Brazil according to data from the Social Security Forum (2016). 
8 According  to  Law  no.  9,876  of  1999,  retirees  by  contribution  time  and  by  age  will  have  their  benefit  salaries  as  a  simple 
arithmetic mean of the highest contribution wages corresponding to eighty percent (0.8) of the entire contributory period.

Finally, solving for j = 1, ..., 35 the maximization of the utility function subject to budget constraint, 
we  obtain  the  intertemporal  trajectories  and  the  intratemporal  relation  of  consumption  and  leisure,

The production function has as input capital and labor and a Cobb - Douglas technology. Capital is 
homogeneous,  while  labor  is  expanded  by  the  level  of  efficiency  (𝑒𝑗),  that  is,  people  of  different  ages 
provide different amounts of labor per leisure unit. Thus the production function is given by: 
 

𝑌𝑡 = 𝐹(𝐾𝑡,𝐿𝑡) = 𝐴𝑡(𝐾𝑡

𝜃𝐿𝑡

1−𝜃) 

(10) 

 

Where   𝑌𝑡 is  the  aggregate  product, 𝐾𝑡 and 𝐿𝑡 represent  capital  and  aggregate  labor,  respectively. 
The  term  θ  is  the  share  of  capital  in  the  production  function  and,  finally, 𝐴𝑡 represents  the  total  factor

productivity.  Thus,  from  the  process  optimization  of  production  function  (10),  we  have  the  following

Where 𝛿 represents the rate of capital depreciation. 
 

2.3 Government 

 
The  government  keeps  the  budget  balanced,  so  that  the  revenues  are  exactly  equal  to  the  sum  of 

government consumption with the social security deficit and transfers. 

 

𝐺𝑡 = 𝑇𝑡 −  𝑆𝑡

𝐵 −   𝑇𝑟𝑡 

(13) 

 
 
𝐺𝑡 is government consumption of goods and services, 𝑆𝑡

𝐵 are the benefits of social security and 𝑇𝑟𝑡 

are government transfers. For the tax collection 𝑇𝑡, we have: 

 

35

57

𝑇𝑡 = ∑ 𝑁𝑗,𝑡

𝜏𝑙𝑡𝑊𝑡𝑒𝑗(1 − 𝑙𝑗,𝑡) + ∑ 𝑁𝑗,𝑡𝑐𝑗,𝑡

𝜏𝑐𝑡 + 𝜏𝑘𝑡(𝑟𝑡 + 𝛿)𝐾𝑡 + 𝑆𝑡

At where 𝑆𝑡
 

𝐴 is the collection of social security and 𝑁𝑗,𝑡 is the population of age j in t periods. 

2.4 Social Security 
 

In Brazil the social security system uses the simple distribution system (PAYG), where the benefits 
received from  retirement extend until the death  of the individual. Following the Brazilian reality, in  the 
model the retirement occurs in j = 37, equivalent to 58 years of age, and the benefit value is calculated by 
the equation (4). 

The total annual social security expenditure can be represented by the following equation: 
 

57

𝐵 = ∑ 𝑁𝑗,𝑡𝑏𝑡
𝑆𝑡

 

𝑗=36

(15) 

 
The  annual  income  of  the  social  security  comes  from  the  contribution  of  the  employees  on  the 

payroll:

𝐿𝑡 = ∑ 𝑁𝑗,𝑡𝑒𝑗(1 − 𝑙𝑡,𝑗)

The balance in the capital market is given by: 
 

𝐾𝑡+1 =   𝑌𝑡 + (1 − 𝛿)𝐾𝑡 − 𝐺𝑡 − 𝐶𝑡 

 
The equality between supply and aggregate demand is represented by equation 19: 
 

𝑌𝑡 =   𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡

𝐶𝑡 = ∑ 𝑐𝑗,𝑡𝑁𝑗,𝑡

2.6 Solution of the Model

(18) 

(19) 
 
(20) 

For  the  solution  of  the  equilibrium  trajectory  of  the  economy,  we  used  the  algorithm  of  Broyden 
(1965)  that  numerically  solves  the  system  of  nonlinear  equations  composed  of  equations  (5)  to  (9)  and 
(11) to (20). The program code was written in Python 3. 

 
 

3. DATA AND CALIBRATION 
 
 

The  calibration  was  done  with  data  from  the  National  Accounts  of  the  IBGE  of  2017  and  data 
from the Federal Revenue Secretariat of 2017. For simplicity, the product of the economy for 2015 was 
set at 1. 

Table 1 presents the model parameters. For the calculation of participation of capital income in the 
product,  θ,  the  gross  operating  surplus  value  was  divided  in  relation  to  the  sum  of  the  salaries  of 
employees and self-employed with the gross operating surplus itself.

Consumption  in  proportion  to  GDP  reached  62.50%  in  2015.  Government  consumption  and 

investments reached 19.77% and 17.71% respectively in relation to GDP. 

The basic interest  rate of the economy (SELIC) for the period was 14.15%, inflation in  2015 was 
10.17%  based  on  the  broad  consumer  price  index  (IPCA),  so  that  the  real  interest  rate  was  3.98%  per 
year.

To  calculate  the  hours  worked  (L),  we  use  the  working  hours  available  for  the  market  activity. 
Thus, from the 168 hours per week, 56 hours of sleep per week are withdrawn, and considering a working 
day of 44 hours per week, L = 44/112 = 0.3928.  

The values for the collection were taken from the study of the Brazilian tax burden (RFB, 2017) and 
social  security  expenditure  was  obtained  through  the  Statistical  Yearbook  of  Social  Security

4. A PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT Nº 287/2016

21,51% 

The Constitutional Amendment Proposal (PEC) nº 287/2016 presented in its initial version a series 
of  changes  not  only  in  Social  Security,  but  also  in  Social  Assistance.  At  this  time,  it  was  proposed  to 
establish a minimum age for both RGPS and RPPS of 65 years old for men and 62 years old for women 
with 20 years of transition rule. A minimum age of 25 years old of contribution to the right to retirement 
was suggested. The calculation of the benefit was modified, so that it would only receive the full amount 
of the pension, who would contribute for 40 years for Social Security. For rural workers it was proposed 
to establish a minimum period of 15 years of contribution. Another proposal was to increase the age for 
granting the benefits to the elderly from 65 to 68 years old. Finally, the government proposed the untying 
of the social security floor of the minimum wage. 

In its present state, January 2018, and in the face of difficulties in approving the original version 
of the reform, PEC 287/2016 was considerably reduced. The proposal was limited to setting a minimum 
age for urban workers only, with a transition rule, 15 years of contribution for the RGPS and 25 years for 
the  RPPS,  and  re-calculation  of  the  retirement  value,  based  on  the  percentage  of  60%  for  those  who 
contributed for 15 years up to 100% for those with 40 years of contribution. 

The table below details the main points of the proposal.

For the purposes of the simulations of PEC 287/2016, a minimum retirement age of 63 years was 
adopted,  equivalent  to  the  proposal  of  65  years  for  men  and  62  years  for  women.  The  transition  rule, 
which  provides  for  the  minimum  age  to  increase  by  1  year  every  two  years  from  2020,  as  well  as  the 
recalculation of benefit, have also been incorporated into the simulation. 

Brazil must pass in the coming years from the demographic bonus situation, in which population 
growth  drives  the  economy,  to  a  situation  of  demographic  "burden"  in  which  the  distribution  of  the 
population has a negative effect on economic growth. It is  estimated that the demographic "bonus" will 
extend until around 2040, when the share of the economically active population starts to decrease. 

The transition rule of PEC 287/2016 attenuates the demographic "burden" by gradually raising the 
minimum  retirement  age,  stabilizing  the  working  age  population  and,  as  a  consequence,  keeping  the 
number of retirees relatively constant, as observed in table 5.

5. RESULTS 
 
 
5.1 Long term results 

 
Table  6  presents  the  results  of  the  long-term  simulations.  Two  simulations  were  carried  out,  the 
first considering the minimum retirement age of 58 years (without social security policy) and the  second 
with the minimum age of 63 years, with transition rule increasing by 1 year every two years until reaching 
63 years (with social security policy).

In all simulations, the demographic change was estimated as estimated by the IBGE (2014) with 
the  projection  of  the  population  by  age  in  2060.  The  IBGE  (2014)  made  projections  for  the  Brazilian 
population up to 2060, estimating a population  growth of almost 27% between 2015 and 2060, but that 
this growth will occur disproportionately among the age groups. The number of people up to 58 years old 
will have decreased by 5.35%, while the number of people over 58 will have grown by 182%. 

The  demographic  transition  supplemented  by  the  increase  in  life  expectancy  of  Brazilians 
substantially  affected  the  social  security  equilibrium.  Social  security  expenditures  go  from  11.02%  of 
GDP  in  the  initial  steady  state  to  27.97%  (without  reform)  or  20.11%  of  GDP  (with  retirement)  in  the 
final  steady  state.  On  the  side  of  social  security  revenues,  there  is  a  negative  variation,  from  6.43%  of 
GDP in initial equilibrium to 6.32% of GDP (without reform) or 7.01% of GDP (with reform) in the new 
long-term equilibrium. As a result, the social security deficit increases from 4.59% of GDP to 21.65% of 
GDP (without reform) or 13.10% of GDP (with retirement). 

Since transfers from the public sector to households are assumed to be constant, the social security 
deficit leads to a sharp reduction in public spending, which falls from 19.77% of GDP in the initial steady 
state to only 5.43% of GDP (without 15.33% of GDP (with reform). 

A second factor that affects outcomes is population growth. IBGE (2014) made projections for the 
Brazilian population until 2059, estimating a growth of almost 27%, but disproportionately among the age 
groups. For simulation purposes, it was assumed that the population distribution remains the same from 
the 45 period. 

By  the  theory  of  the  cycle  of  life,  with  an  older  population,  the  aggregate  consumption  tends  to 
increase. This  growth  is  boosted by population  growth and occupies the space in  the aggregate demand 
previously destined to the consumption of the public sector. Still, in per capita terms, simulation without 
pension reform suggests a decline in per capita consumption, while with retirement this variable remains 
practically at the same level as the initial steady state. 

Capital stock increases in the long term  with PEC 287/2016. The explanation of this behavior is 
due to the demographic change, accompanied by the increase of the minimum age, which stimulates the 
accumulation  of  capital  for  more  time  by  the  workers.  In  addition,  as  retirement  time  is  shorter  with 
retirement,  the  number  of  retirees  is  lower,  so  that  unemployment  is  also  reduced  compared  to  the 
unreformed scenario. 

Regarding the labor supply, the results directly reflect the demographic change and the increase of 
the time for the retirement. In the case without reform, only the demographic change acts, so that there is 
a fall in the labor supply in the long term. In the simulation with PEC 287/2016, raising the minimum age 
more than compensates for the demographic transition so that labor supply grows. 

The  aggregate  product  increases  with  PEC  287/2016,  avoiding  an  even  greater  economic 
recession.  In  any  case,  the  Brazilian  social  security  deficit  charges  a  high  price  of  per  capita  product, 
which falls 22.5% in the scenario without reform and 14% in the scenario with PEC 287/2016. 

 

5.2 Transition path and medium-term results 
 

Figure  1  shows  the  transition  path  of  social  security  expenditure  and  income,  as  well  as  other 

macroeconomic variables. 

Aggregate  consumption  begins  its  accelerated  growth,  reflecting  the  increase  in  population,  and 
reaches  the  maximum  around  the  30th  period.  The  differentiation  in  the  trajectories  with  and  without 
reform stems from the fact that the increase in the minimum age for retirement makes the period is higher, 
providing a higher income over the life cycle with higher consumption. 

As  for  the  capital  stock,  the  presence  of  the  pension  reform  substantially  affects  the  trajectory. 
PEC 287/2016, by maintaining a greater number of active workers, encourages capital investment during 
the transition. However, as the population ages, investment tends to decline, albeit with a higher level of 
capital  accumulated  during  the  transition,  and  necessary  to  accommodate  higher  output  with  increased 
labor supply.

Source: Elaboration of the authors.  

The  number  of  workers  grows  up  around  the  period  20,  following  a  favorable  demography. 
However,  from  this  point  on,  without  the  reform,  demographic  change  is  reversed  and  the  number  of 
workers  decreases  year  by  year.  The  difference  in  the  trajectories  of  the  labor  supply  with  and  without 
reform stems directly from the increase in the minimum age proposed by PEC 287/2016. 

As for the aggregate product, on the supply side, the reform allows the increase in time following 
the positive trajectories of capital and labor inputs. The opposite occurs in the situation without reform, in 
which the product falls along with the fall in inputs. On the demand side, the result of the Brazilian social 
security without reform reduces government spending by almost 5% of GDP, which is not offset by the 
increase  in  private  consumption,  so  that  without  reform,  aggregate  demand  decreases.  With  reform,  the 
decline  in  public  consumption  is  lower,  going  from  19.77%  to  15.33%  of  GDP,  easily  offset  by  the 
increase in private consumption, so that aggregate demand increases with the reform. 

The pension deficit is contained in the short term by the reform proposed by PEC 287/2016. It is 
observed that the increase in the minimum age is able to keep the social security deficit relatively constant 
for  about  20  periods.  After  that,  the  demographic  transition  becomes  more  pronounced  and  the  reform 
proves  incapable  of  containing  the  growth  of  the  pension  deficit.  Without  reform,  social  security 
expenditures  are  growing  in  the  short  term,  in  an  explosive  trajectory,  causing  a  sharp  contraction  of 
government consumption and leading to an unsustainable fiscal situation in the medium term. 

The  per  capita  variables  that  show  the  real  effect  on  the  economy.  In  2059,  the  population  will 
have  grown  almost  27%,  but  disproportionately.  The  number  of  people  up  to  58  years  old  will  have 
decreased by 5.4%, while the number of people over 58 will have grown by 182%. The consequence is 
shrinkage  of  output  and  consumption  per  capita  as  shown  in  the  graphs.  The  growing  deficit  of  social 

11 

 

security  makes  the  Brazilian  population  poorer.  PEC  No.  287/2016  softens  the  problem,  but  does  not 
prevent  the  impoverishment  of  the  population,  with  a  drop  in  the  per  capita  product  of  around  22.68% 
without politics and 13.79% with social security policy. 

 
 

5.3 Sensitivity Analysis 

To  test  the  sensitivity  of  the  results  in  relation  to  the  parameters,  the  intertemporal  substitution 
elasticity,  γ,  and  the  preference  for  leisure  in  the  utility  function,  α,  were  chosen.  Both  were  chosen 
because  they  were  not  calibrated  and  their  values  in  the  simulation  base  scenario  were  taken  from 
literature. Thus, the simulations were repeated for different values of these two parameters. Tables 9 and 
10  present  the  results.  Only  the  results  referring  to  the  adjustment  of  government  expenditures  were 
presented. 

In relation to the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, Havranek et al. (2015) present estimates 
for 104 countries based  on 169 studies published in  different  periods. The average found for all studies 
was  0.5.  However,  half  the  published  work  refers  to  the  United  States.  When  the  average  between 
countries  is  considered,  the  elasticity  value  rises  to  0.7.  Interestingly,  that  for  Brazil,  the  estimate  was 
0.107  with  a  standard  deviation  of  0.093.  As  the  baseline  scenario,  given  by  the  calibration,  already 
contemplates γ = 0.7, the sensitivity analysis tested the other two values - 0.2 and 0.5. 

Regarding  leisure  preference,  national  literature  presents  different  values  for  this  parameter.  For 
example, Paes (2011) uses 2.02, while Araújo and Ferreira (1999) use 1,4; Paes and Bugarin (2006), 1.94 
and  Pereira  and  Ferreira  (2010),  0.94.  In  the  sensitivity  analysis,  values  between  0.5  and  2.0  were 
considered, within the range adopted by the Brazilian literature.

The base scenario, given by the calibration, appears in bold in the table. Economic theory suggests 
that  the  lower  the  elasticity  of  intertemporal  substitution,  the  lower  the  household  savings,  so  that  they 
begin  to  value  the  present  consumption  more  to  the  detriment  of  future  consumption.  This  actually  did 
appear in the results, with the economy moving into a long-run equilibrium with a sharp drop in capital 
stock,  which  is  reflected  in  reduced  output  and  aggregate  consumption.  Therefore,  if  families  are  more 
impatient about the future, the economic consequences of population aging will be worse. 

Regarding changes in preference for leisure, it is  expected that the increase in  the values  of this 
parameter has quite negative effects on labor supply, accompanied by a reduction in private consumption. 
The results confirm this behavior, however, government spending becomes zero from α = 1. This implies 
the complete collapse of government, so that the results no longer have economic sense.

As in the sensitivity analysis of the scenario without reform, with the change in the minimum age, 
the pattern was  exactly the same: lower savings  for lower values of intertemporal  substitution elasticity 
and lower labor supply and private consumption for higher values of preference for leisure, 𝛼. 

 
 

6. FINAL COMMENTS  

With a model of overlapping  generations, this study analyzed the impact of population  aging on 
social security and the Brazilian economy. There is a strong increase in the social security deficit, which 
is expected to jump from the current 4% of GDP to above 11.1% of GDP in 2060. A second scenario in 
which the Proposed Constitutional Amendment No. 287/2016 would be approved. This proposal basically 
establishes a minimum age for retirement in Brazil. 

 The results suggest that not doing retirement is a very bad choice for society. The fiscal situation 
becomes  unsustainable,  and  the  expansion  of  social  security  expenditures  in  combination  with  the 
reduction  of  labor  supply  end  up  leading  the  country  to  a  scenario  of  a  sharp  fall  in  per  capita 
consumption and consumption. 

On the other hand, the simulations indicate that PEC 287/2016 is not the definitive solution to the 
Brazilian  social  security  issue,  but  that  it  allows  a  window  of  about  10  to  15  years  in  which  the  social 
security deficit stabilizes. After this period, the situation worsens once again with social security returning 
to an explosive trajectory. 

As  a  policy  suggestion,  although  PEC  No.  287/2016  has  not  even  been  voted  on,  the 
recommendation  is  that  it  represent  a  minimum  level  of  pension  reform,  and  it  is  desirable  that  a  more 
restrictive reform,  which will raise the retirement age even  further, is  proposed to  have a longer lasting 
effect on the economy.
