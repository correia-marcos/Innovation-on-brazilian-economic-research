Abstract: Many economies seek to upgrade the quality of their exports in order to gain improved access to 
the  importing  market,  enhance  competitiveness  in  international  trade,  higher  productivity,  better  wages, 
and an increase in the product price and in the income, resulting in a possible improvement in the terms of 
trade. Furthermore, a growth trend was observed for Brazil at the beginning of the 21st century, while there 
was an increase in the concentration of Brazilian exports on low value-added goods, mainly due to a higher 
revealed comparative advantage in these sectors. This research sought to contribute to the debate over the 
quality of Brazilian exports and relate to the existence of a revealed comparative advantage. Moreover, it 
was  intended to  associate the existence of comparative advantage with  penetration  in the  markets of the 
main trading partners of Brazil. Unconditional quantile regression and 2SLS were used as methods. Among 
the  results,  it  was  evidenced  that,  regardless  of  the  income  of  the  country  and  the  product  groups,  the 
existence of revealed comparative advantage provides higher quality in the Brazilian exports. In addition, 
the RCA also contributes to a greater penetration of Brazilian products in the importing countries. 
Keywords: quality of exports; revealed comparative advantage; exports penetration; unconditional quantile 
regression; instrumental variable. 
 
Resumo: Muitas economias procuram elevar a qualidade de suas exportações com o intuito de ter maior 
acesso  ao  mercado  importador,  aumentar  a  competitividade  no  comércio  internacional,  maior 
produtividade, melhores salários, e aumento no preço do produto e na renda. Dessa forma, observa-se para 
o Brasil, no início do século XXI, uma tendência de concentração da pauta de exportações brasileira em 
produtos  de  baixo  valor  agregado,  principalmente  devido  à  uma  maior  vantagem  comparativa  revelada 
nesses  setores.  Portanto,  o  presente  trabalho  possuiu  o  intuito  de  contribuir  para  o  debate  acerca  da 
qualidade  das  exportações  brasileiras,  relacionando-as  com  a  existência  de  uma  vantagem  comparativa 
revelada. Além disso, pretendeu-se associar a existência de vantagem comparativa com a penetração nos 
mercados  dos  principais  parceiros  comerciais  do  Brasil.  Como  metodologia,  utilizou-se  a  regressão 
quantílica incondicional e MQ2E. Entre os resultados, evidenciou-se que, independente da renda do país e 
dos grupos de produtos, a existência de vantagem comparativa revelada proporciona uma maior qualidade 
nas exportações brasileiras. Além disso, a RCA também contribuiu para uma maior penetração nos países 
importadores de produtos brasileiros. 
Palavras-chave: qualidade das exportações; vantagem comparativa revelada; penetração das exportações;

1.  INTRODUCTION 

With  the  expansion  of  world  trade,  the  transformations  that  occurred  in  Brazil  in  recent  years  were 
crucial to reinforce one of the main structural characteristics of the Brazilian foreign trade insertion - the 
concentration of the export agenda on products with low added value. The process of primarization of the 
country's export agenda was accentuated while the low export penetration in medium- and high-technology 
markets was maintained (HIRATUKA; CUNHA, 2011).  

However, even  if  Brazil exports, in  its  majority, products with  lower added value,  it is still possible 
that, among the countries that trade the same good in the international market, it differentiates itself in terms 
of the quality of this product. In addition, even if the country is unable to export most technologically more 
advanced products, it can specialize in the marketing of small groups of products with higher added value 
and, in relation to other countries, increase its quality and/or achieve greater diversification of its exports 
in the international market. 

Products can be distinguished vertically or horizontally. The horizontal dimension refers to the different 
types  of  goods,  such  as  cars,  wines,  coffee  beans,  among  others.  The  vertical  dimension  refers  to  the 
intrinsic  quality  of  each  specific  product,  i.e.,  characteristics  that  show  substantial  differences  from one 
product to another, such as ageing time or grape selection in wine preparation (JAIMOVICH; MERELLA, 
2015). 

The main results of recent work relate the increase in the quality of exports of countries with greater 
access to the importing market of trading partners, mainly due to an increase in the competitiveness of their 
products in international trade. In addition, they associate better quality products with higher productivity, 
better wages, higher prices of goods and income, resulting in a possible improvement in the terms of trade5. 
Many studies have indicated new patterns of trade regarding the differentiation of exported products. 
Recent research has found that richer countries export better quality goods6 and that they have consumers 
with  a  higher  inclination  to  pay  for  these  products  and,  therefore,  also  import  better  quality  goods7. 
However, more developed countries do not always produce higher quality goods than less developed ones, 
due  to  the  possibility  of  poorer  nations  marketing  those  products  in  which  they  have  a  comparative 
advantage8 (ALCALÁ, 2008). 

According to Alcalá (2016), companies in a country with a comparative advantage in one sector tend 
to be more productive globally and therefore produce higher quality goods. Jaimovich and Merella (2015) 
stressed that  comparative  advantage  is  strengthened  as  product  quality  increases.  These  authors  showed 
that  the  comparative  advantage  and  quality  of  exported  products  contributed  to  greater  penetration  in 
importing markets. According to Crinò and Epifani (2012), improving quality could be a prerequisite for 
effective access to the markets of richer countries. Moreover, when a firm sells better quality products, it 
can reach more distant markets, i.e. more difficult to penetrate, as evidenced in Bastos and Silva (2010), 
Baldwin and Harrigan (2011), Johnson (2012) and Verhoogen (2008). 

Unlike  existing  studies  in  the  literature,  both  national  and  international,  this  study  analyzed  the 
relationship  between  revealed  comparative  advantage  (RCA)9  and  the  quality  of  Brazilian  exports  from 
1997 to 2016. In addition, this research sought to verify the influence of RCA on the penetration of Brazilian 
exports  in  the  market  of  its  50  main  importers  or  nearly  90%  of  the  Brazilian  trade.  Finally,  the 
characteristics  of  the  importing  country  were  related  to  the  Brazilian  trade  patterns  in  terms  of  export 
quality. 

In order to disaggregate the analysis on the subject of the research, we estimated the different factors 
affecting  export  quality  by  considering  different  sectors,  product  groups,  income  levels  of  importing

8 For example, a country may produce the best cigars, because its soil and climate are ideal for growing tobacco. Thus, it is likely 
that the country has a vertical specialization in the production of cigars, resulting in a possible relationship between the quality 
of exports of this good and its comparative advantage (ALCALÁ, 2008).

of a given good compared to other countries and/or sectors. Further details on this variable will be provided later.

countries  and  quality  ranges  -  by  means  of  quantiles.  Thus,  it  is  possible  to  include,  for  a  better 
understanding, several scenarios, considering different characteristics for each disaggregation. 

This study sought to contribute to the formulation of public policies that focus on improving quality, as 
an incentive to innovation, qualified labor, among others. Therefore, by understanding the determinants of 
the quality of Brazilian exports, public action could be better articulated and concentrated on these main 
elements. 

This  study  is  structured  in  three  other  sections  in  addition  to  this  introduction.  The  second  section 
presents  the  methodology  while  the  third  shows  the  results  and  discussion.  Lastly,  the  fourth  section 
concludes. 

 
2.  METHODOLOGY 
2.1 Quality of exports 
One  limitation  of  the  studies  on  quality  is  the  difficulty  in  defining  what  product  quality  really  is. 
However,  many  authors,  such  as  Hummels  and  Klenow  (2005),  Brooks  (2006),  Hallak  (2006),  Alcalá 
(2016) and Brambilla and Porto (2016), have attempted to measure the quality of products through proxies, 
such as the export price (unit values). However, this measure would not be adequate since, according to 
Hallak  and  Schott  (2011),  product  prices  may  vary  for  different  reasons,  such  as  production  costs  or 
variations in the exchange rate, i.e., changes in prices may not only be associated with changes in product 
quality. 

Considering these findings, this paper used the quality measure of Khandelwal (2010) and Khandelwal, 
Schott and Wei (2013), who applied  the model developed  by Berry (1994) to  data on American  foreign 
trade. This calculation is able to measure the quality including characteristics that are not observable to the 
product  and/or the  market.  The  authors  assume  a  CES type  utility  function  and  consider  that  consumer 
preferences incorporate quality (δ), so the utility function is: 

𝜎

⁄
(𝜎−1)

𝜕𝑔

]

 

 

(1) 

U = [∫ (𝛿𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡(𝑔)𝑞𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡(𝑔))

𝜎−1/𝜎

𝑔𝜖𝐺

 

where 𝑞𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡(𝑔) and 𝛿𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡(𝑔) correspond to the quantity (kg) and quality level of the k variety exported by 
country i to country j in year t, respectively, while σ represents the elasticity of substitution. By maximizing 
the utility function, shown in equation (1), subject to the budget constraint, we obtain the demand equation 
given by: 

𝜎−1)(𝑝𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡

−𝜎 )(𝑃𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡

𝑞𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡(𝑔) = (δ𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡

(2) 
where 𝑝𝑘𝑖𝑗  is the price of product k sold by country i  to j in year t; 𝑃𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡  and 𝑌𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡 represent the price and 
rent  index  of  product  k  in  country  j  in  year t,  respectively.  By  taking  the  logarithm  in  equation  (2), the 
quality  of  each  observation  that  comprises  the  Brazilian  exports  was  obtained  by  the  residual  of  the 
following equation: 

𝜎−1)𝑌𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡  

lnq𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜎  ∗  𝑙𝑛𝑝𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼𝑗 + 𝛼𝑘 + 𝜀𝑘𝑗𝑡  

(3) 
where 𝑞𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡  refers to the exported quantity (kg) of each product k from country i to country j in year t; 𝑝𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑡  
is the exported value of each product k from country i to country j in year t; σ is the elasticity of substitution; 
𝛼𝑗 and 𝛼𝑘 are fixed effects of importing country and product, respectively. Equation (3) was estimated by 
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). As in Filho, Medeiros and Albuquerquemello (2017), the average elasticity 
of  substitution  (σ)  estimated  by  Broda,  Greenfield  and  Weinstein  (2006)  was  used  for  each  importing 
country. 

The  quality  of  the  products  exported  by  Brazil  from  each  product  to  the  j-th  country  δ𝑘𝑗   was 
obtained by dividing the residual obtained  in equation (3) by the elasticity of substitution  minus one, as 
follows: 

qualidade = δ𝑘𝑗𝑡

̂ ≡ 𝜀̂𝑘𝑗𝑡/𝜎 − 1

Therefore, the measure of quality10 of Brazilian exports of product k for each country j in period t 
was incorporated into the estimated equations of this study that will be explained in the following section. 
 

2.2 Comparative advantage and quality of Brazilian exports 
In order to meet the objective of analyzing the relationship between the comparative advantage in a 
given product and the quality of Brazilian exports to the country's main trading partners 11, the first model 
is based on Alcalá (2016) and is expressed as follows: 

𝑙𝑛(𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖.𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 ) = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑙𝑛(𝑅𝐶𝐴𝑖𝑘𝑡) + 𝛽2𝑙𝑛(𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑗𝑡) + 𝛽3𝑆𝑃𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡

+ 𝛽4𝑇𝐵𝑇𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 +  𝛽5𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑗 + 𝛽6𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑔.𝑖𝑗+ 𝛼𝑡 + 𝜇𝑧 + 𝜏𝑗 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 

(5) 

where quali.𝑗𝑘𝑡  is the indicator of the quality of exports from country i (Brazil) to country j in product k12 
in year t, obtained by equation (4), used in Filho, Medeiros and Albuquerquemello (2017), Manova and Yu 
(2017), Khandelwal, Schott and Wei (2013) and Khandelwal (2010). 

𝑅𝐶𝐴𝑖𝑘𝑡 is the indicator of revealed comparative advantage of exports of country i (Brazil) in product 

k13 in year t. Calculated according to Jaimovich and Merella (2015): 

𝑅𝐶𝐴𝑖𝑘𝑡 =

𝑋𝑖𝑘𝑡

𝑊𝑘𝑡

⁄
𝑋𝑖𝑡

⁄
𝑊𝑡

 

(6) 

where 𝑋𝑖𝑘𝑡  is the value of exports of product k from country i in year t; 𝑋𝑖𝑡 is the total value of exports of 
country i in year t; 𝑊𝑘𝑡  is the total value of exports of product k from the world in year t and 𝑊𝑡 is the value 
of world exports in year t. One would expect to find for the variable 𝑉𝐶𝑅𝑖𝑘𝑡  (β1) a statistically significant 
and positive relationship. And, therefore, the hypothesis that a greater comparative advantage results in an 
increase  in the quality of  its exports would  confirm.  Alcalá (2008, 2016) conducted similar analyses for 
imports from the United States and found the same relationship. 

𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑗𝑡 is the gross domestic product by purchasing power parity of the importing country j in year 
t. It is expected that the coefficient estimated for this variable (β2) is statistically significant and positive, 
which  in such a case would  confirm that Brazil exports  higher quality products to  countries with higher 
income. This pattern of trade specialization according to the GDP of the importing country was observed 
in world terms by Hallak (2006), Fieler (2012) and Crinò and Epifani (2012). 

𝑆𝑃𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡  is  the  number  of  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  measures  applied  to  country  i  (Brazil)  by 
country j on product k in year t. 𝑇𝐵𝑇𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 is the number of technical  barriers to trade measures applied to 
country i (Brazil) by country j on product k in year t. The use of these variables is intended to verify whether 
the  SPS  and  TBT  measures14  would  act  to  improve  the  quality  of  Brazilian  exports.  When  the  country 
imposes SPS and TBT measures and the exporter is able to adapt to the notification requirements, the result 
may be the shipment of higher quality products. Such a result may be due to the need for the measures to 
be  scientifically  justified  and,  many  cases,  transformations  in  the  production  process  are  necessary.  In 
addition,  it  is  in  the  interest  of  countries  to  meet  the  requirements  contained  in  notifications  for  the 
maintenance of trade. In the end, they can have effects similar to those of applying import tariffs. In this 
context, Fan, Li and Yaple (2015) found that, between 2001 and 2005, a reduction in Chinese import tariffs 
resulted in an increase in the quality and price of their exports in the international market. This is because 

                                                             
10 According to Khandelwal (2010) and Khandelwal, Schott and Wei (2013), quality is inferred from the demand side, i.e., it is 
assumed  that  quality  is  any  attribute  that  increases  consumer  demand,  besides  the  price  influence.  This  approach  takes  into 
account quality changes within the Harmonized System (HS) categories or within companies. 
11  The  countries  that  make  up  the  sample  are  Brazil's  50  main  trade  partners  between  1997  and  2016,  provided  they  had 
information on the country's income elasticity in the study of Broda, Greenfield and Weinstein (2006), necessary to calculate the 
quality of exports, and had imported Brazilian products throughout the period. In addition, the sample countries imported almost 
90% of Brazilian exports from 1997 to 2016. 
12 It is important to note that all products of the 6-digit HS are considered in this study. 
13 At the 2-digit HS disaggregation level. 
14 These measures need to be scientifically justified and examined by the World Trade Organization (WTO). After the process 
of verifying the need for the measure, each country issues a notification containing the required standards and procedures, and 
the other countries included in the document need to adapt to the rules in order to maintain trade.

lower tariffs can contribute, for example, to facilitating access to intermediate inputs and, as a consequence, 
firms tend to produce higher-quality goods. 

𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑗 represents the distance, in kilometers, between the capital of each country. This is a proxy 
commonly used to measure transport costs between two countries, according to Mendonça (2011), Almeida 
et al. (2014) and Silva (2016). Bastos and Silva (2010) used this variable in order to show that, with the 
increasing distance between trading partners, only the most productive firms are able to export and produce 
goods of better quality. 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡.𝑖𝑗 is the dummy variable that assumes value 1 if Brazil and country j share a 
common border and 0 otherwise. This variable tries to capture if, because there is a lower cost of transport 
to countries that share a common border, Brazil exports products of better quality to these nations; 𝛼𝑡, 𝜇𝑧, 
𝜏𝑗 and 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡  represent, respectively, time, industry15 and importing country fixed effects, and the residual of 
the regression. 

In  order  to  meet  the  objective  of  analyzing  how  the  comparative  advantage  influences  the 

penetration of Brazilian exports in certain countries, the following equation was estimated: 

𝑙𝑛(EP𝑗𝑘𝑡) = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑙𝑛(𝑅𝐶𝐴𝑖𝑘𝑡) + 𝛽2𝑙𝑛(𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑗𝑡) + 𝛽3𝑆𝑃𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 + 𝛽4𝑇𝐵𝑇𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡

(7) 

+ 𝛽5𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑗 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝜇𝑧 + 𝜏𝑗 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡  

Equation (7) is based on the study of Jaimovich and Merella (2015), as well as the way to quantify 
export penetration. The depended variable is EP𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 , which is the penetration index of Brazilian exports of 
product k16 in country j in period t obtained from: 

𝐸𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 =

𝐸𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡
𝐸𝑤𝑗𝑘𝑡

 

(8) 

where 𝐸𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡  refers to the total value of exports from country i (Brazil) to country j of product k in year t; 
while 𝐸𝑤𝑗𝑘𝑡 refers to the total value of exports from the world w to country j of product k in year t. 

The explanatory variables are the same as those used in equation (5). These variables included in 
the  model  are  in  accordance  with  the  studies  of  Alcalá  (2016)  and  Jaimovich  and  Merella  (2015).  The 
expectation  is  that  the  coefficient  of  the  variable  of  interest  𝑅𝐶𝐴𝑖𝑘𝑡  (β1)  is  statistically  significant  and 
positive, which in such a case would confirm the hypothesis that a greater comparative advantage results 
in an increase in the penetration of these goods in international markets, as shown in Jaimovich and Merella 
(2015). 

Finally,  the  analysis  was  also  divided  into  groups  of  agricultural  and  industrial17  products  and 
developed  and  developing  countries18.  The  products  were  then  divided  into  14  categories19  in  order  to 
attempt to understand the characteristics of each group. 

 
2.3 Empirical strategy 
The  studies  that  analyzed  the  quality  of  exports,  mostly,  used  the  technique  of  Instrumental 
Variables (IV) (HALLAK, 2006; ALCALÁ, 2008; KHANDELWAL, 2010; HALLAK; SCHOTT, 2011; 
ALCALÁ, 2016; CRINÒ; OGLIARI, 2017). In this study, the RCA is potentially endogenous between this 

                                                             
15 The aggregation of products at the 2-digit HS level is considered an industry. 
16 At the 4-digit HS disaggregation level. 
17 It should be noted that all products of the 6-digit HS are considered in this study. These goods were grouped into two sectors: 
agricultural and industrialized. Agricultural products were considered all those defined as such by the Agreement on Agriculture, 
negotiated between WTO members in the Uruguay Round. In detail, agricultural products comprise chapters 1 to 24 of the HS, 
excluding chapter 3 (fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates). In addition, some products from other chapters 
were included in the agreement: 29.05.4, 33.01, 35.01, 35.02, 35.03, 35.04, 35.05, 38.09.1, 38.23.6, 41.01, 41.02, 41.03, 43.01, 
50.01, 50.02, 50.03, 51.01, 51.02, 51.03, 52.01, 52.02, 52.03, 53.01, 53.02. For industrialized products, the rest of the HS chapters 
were considered. 
18 In some estimates, the countries were divided into two groups according to the World Bank classification (2018). The first 
group would be the more developed countries, which had gross national income per capita (GNI) of $12,056.00 or more in 2017. 
For the second group, the least developed countries, it included countries with medium-high and medium-low income, ranging 
from $996 to $12,055. For developed countries, there were a total of 30 countries, while for developing countries there were 20 
countries. 
19  The  groups  are  formed  by  joining  the  subgroups  at  the  2-digit  HS  aggregation  level,  according  to  https://www.foreign-
trade.com/reference/hscode.htm. As in Jaimovich and Merella (2015), the "Miscellaneous" and "Services" groups were excluded.

variable  and  the  dependent  variables,  export  quality  (quali.𝑗𝑘𝑡)  and  export  penetration  (EP𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 ).  This 
problem is present in this study due to the existence of data on Brazilian exports of product k to country j 
on both sides of equations (5) and (7), that is, in the dependent variables’ quality and penetration of exports 
and the explanatory variable revealed comparative advantage. As demonstrated in Alcalá (2016), errors in 
the  measurement  of  these  data  could  be  passed  on  to  both  sides  of  the  equation.  Thus,  estimating  the 
equation  using  the  OLS  method  would  deliver  biased  and  inconsistent  estimates.  Therefore,  the  IV 
technique was used in order to try and correct endogeneity. 

As Alcalá (2016), the instrument used to treat endogeneity is the RCA measure that excludes exports 

of product k to country j. This measure follows: 

𝑒𝑥𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 =

RCA𝑖𝑘𝑡

𝑋𝑖𝑘𝑡 − 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 𝑋𝑖𝑡 − 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡
𝑊𝑘𝑡 − 𝑊𝑗𝑘𝑡 𝑊𝑡 − 𝑊𝑗𝑡

⁄
⁄

 

   (9) 

where 𝑋𝑖𝑘𝑡 − 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡  are the Brazilian exports of product k excluding exports of product k to country j. 𝑋𝑖𝑡 −
𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡  are total Brazilian exports excluding total exports to country j. 𝑊𝑘𝑡 − 𝑊𝑗𝑘𝑡  are world exports of product 
k excluding exports of product k to country j. 𝑊𝑡 − 𝑊𝑗𝑡  are total world exports excluding exports to country 
j. 

Thus, for equation (7), the 2SLS method was used. While for equation (5), unconditional quantile 
regression was used, considering that the relationship between the explanatory variables and the explained 
variable might be different when comparing different quality levels. The unconditional quantile regression 
was used in equation (5) in the second stage. In the first stage, in order to try to correct the endogeneity 
problem, the endogenous  RCA was estimated  in relation  to its instrument 𝑅𝐶𝐴𝑒𝑥 and all the explanatory 
variables of equation (5), besides the fixed effects of year, importing country and industry (HS02). For this 
reason, it was used in the second stage the forecast of the Y (RCA) of the first stage. In this study, it was 
used, therefore, the approach of unconditional quantile regression, proposed by Firpo et al. (2009), for the 
estimates of equations that have as the dependent variable the quality of Brazilian exports. The advantage 
of this method is that it allows to analyze the influence of the explanatory variables used in this study in the 
different quality quantiles, in addition to making comparisons between the quantile results. 

The approach of Firpo et al. (2009) is based on the influence function (IF). The IF(Y; v; F𝑦) influence 
function  of  a  distribution  statistic  v(F𝑦)  represents  the  influence  of  an  individual  variable  on  this 
distribution statistic. By adding the v(F𝑦) statistic again to the influence function, it results in what is called 
the recentered influence funcion (RIF). This method allows for the estimation of the effect of changes in a 
set of covariates X in the statistical distribution that is of interest. Therefore, in this case, we are interested 
in the influence on the quantile distribution. Thus, the unconditional quantile regression is defined by Firpo 
et al., 2009: 

v(F𝑦) = E𝑥[𝐸[RIF(y;  v; F𝑦)]] = 𝐸(𝑋). 𝛽 

(10) 
It is noteworthy that the conditional quantile regression, proposed by Basset and Kroenker (1978), 
is  different  from  the  unconditional  quantile  regression,  proposed  by  Firpo  et  al.  (2007,  2009).  In  the 
conditional  quantile  regression,  the  effect  found  in  each  quantile  is  conditional  on  the  characteristics  of 
vector X of that quantile under analysis only (within-group effect) and cannot be extrapolated to the others. 
In the unconditional quantile regression, one can analyze the effect of the vector of covariates X throughout 
the distribution of the dependent variable, thus allowing to verify the effect both on the quantile (within-
group  effect),  as  between  quantiles  (between-group  effect),  which  enables  the  performance  of  a  more 
accurate analysis on the topic (FIRPO et al., 2007). 
 

2.4 Data source 
The data used in this work are annual and cover the years 1997 to 2016. Data on Brazilian exports 
(US$) and quantity (kg) were collected from SECEX/MDIC (Secretariat of Foreign Trade  - Ministry of 
Development, Industry and Foreign Trade, 2018). In this database, the classification of products follows 
the Mercosur Common Nomenclature (NCM), with its first digits corresponding to the first digits of HS. 

The  United  Nations  Commodity  Trade  Statistics  Database  (UNCTAD,  2018)  was  used  for 
information on exports and imports and allowed to calculate the RCA and EP. The Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP)  of  Brazil's  main  trading  partners  was  obtained  from  the  World  Bank  (World  Development 
6 

 

Indicators,  2018).  The  geographical  distance  (distance  between  the  capital  of  the  importing  countries 
selected in the sample and Brasilia, measured in km) as well as the existence of a common border between 
Brazil and the partners were obtained from the Center for Prospective Studies and International Information 
(CEPII, 2018). Notifications of SPS and TBT measures issued by Brazilian importers were collected at the 
WTO (2017) taking into account notifications from each industry (2-digit HS)20. 

 
3 RESULTS 
3.1 Descriptive analysis 
Table  1  presents  the  average  RCA,  quality  and  penetration  of  exports  according  to  the  partner 
country's  income  and  type  of  product.  As  expected,  the  average  RCA  of  agricultural  products  is  much 
higher than that of industrialized products. According to Maranhão and Filho (2016), as of the 2000s, there 
was a large growth in the export of agricultural products motivated mainly by the increase in demand from 
emerging countries and high prices, which provided the boom in commodities. In addition, according to 
the authors, there  is an expansion  in competitiveness gains, these  linked to technological  modernization 
with the resulting expansion of productivity. 

On the other hand, the average quality of industrialized products is higher than that of agricultural 
goods.  As  explained  by  Khandelwal  (2010),  some  products  have  a  broad  quality  "ladder"  and  this  is 
generally more evident in industrialized products than in agriculture21. Thus, the quality for industrialized 
products tends, in most cases, to assume great values, which may explain a higher average quality for these 
goods, even if Brazil cannot, in general, be so competitive in these sectors. 

As  far as penetration  is concerned, Brazilian agricultural products have a greater insertion  in the 
markets of other countries than industrialized ones. A study by Teixeira Filho et al. (2001), in which they 
analyzed the activities of various sectors of Brazilian agricultural production,  indicated a high degree of 
competition  in  international  markets  for these products. As a result, Brazilian basic products are able to 
reach many important international markets, such as China, the United States, the Netherlands, Germany 
and Russia, which import more than half of Brazilian products in this sector (BRAZIL, 2017).

In relation to the level of development, Brazil exports products that have higher RCA to developed 
countries,  but  this  difference  is  not  so  great  in  relation  to  developing  countries.  In  general,  the  average 
quality of products exported to developed and developing countries assumes close values, even if the first 
group presents a slightly higher average. 

                                                             
20 It was considered that the number of notifications does not show great variation within each industry. Products belonging to 
the same industry have similar characteristics. Thus, when a notification is issued, it usually covers a group of similar products 
and, therefore, generally affects products from the same industry in the same way. 
21 In addition to the factors already observable such as price and market power, quality is obtained through a calculation that 
considers  its  determining  components,  which  are  sometimes  subjective.  These  components are  captured  by  the  error  term  of 
equation (7). Thus, industrialized products have more factors that enable greater quality differentiation compared to agricultural 
products. For example, when taking into account the quality of computers and apples, there are many more factors that are not 
observable and/or that are not included in the equation, which are captured by the error term, influencing in greater intensity the 
quality of the first good relative to the second. Khandelwal (2010) highlights this fact explaining the concept of quality "ladder", 
which is greater for industrialized products than for agricultural products. The quality "ladder", in this sense, corresponds to the 
amplitude that can assume the quality of a product, that is, the difference between the highest and the lowest value.

Brazilian exports have a greater penetration  in developing countries than  in developed countries. 
Some factors may explain this result such as, for example, the fact that richer markets have more rigorous 
consumers and the  competition to reach them  is greater, which  may  hinder the penetration of exports in 
these countries. In addition, Brazil's international strategy in recent years has focused on deepening relations 
with many developing countries in order to reach trade agreements, introducing a logic of rapprochement 
with  large  countries  in  the  South,  especially  since  2003  (OLIVEIRA,  2012).  Furthermore,  proximity  to 
Latin American countries may also explain this result. Countries that are located geographically close to 
Latin America have lower logistics and transport costs and, therefore, the expenses that have been saved 
could be used to improve production processes and, consequently, product quality. 

 
3.2 Effects of revealed comparative advantage on the quality of Brazilian exports 
This section presents the estimates of equation (5) that shows the relationship between the quality 
of Brazilian exports and  some  control  variables such as distance, GDP of the  importing country, among 
others, as well as the explanatory variable of interest, which is the revealed comparative advantage. The 
equation was estimated through the Unconditional Quantile Regression, Fixed Effects Panel (FE) and Two 
Stage Least Squares (2SLS) and the results are presented in Table 2. 

Alcalá  (2008,  2016)  suggests  the  existence  of  endogeneity  between  quality  and  RCA.  For  this 
reason,  the  equation  was  estimated  by  Unconditional  Quantile  Regression,  with  the  first  stage obtained 
indirectly, in order to try to treat endogeneity. The results were obtained for the full sample, for developed 
and developing countries, for agricultural and  industrialized products and for 14 sectors of the Brazilian 
economy (estimated by 2SLS). To confirm the existence of endogeneity, the Durbin-Wu-Hausman (DWH) 
test was performed, indicating that, in fact, the RCA is an endogenous variable. The F test was calculated 
and it was verified that the instruments considered are strong (the value of the calculated F is greater than 
10  for  all  regressions).  However,  the  analysis  of  this  section  was  made  based  on  the  results  of  the 
unconditional quantile regression - with the exception of the regressions of the 14 sectors of the economy 
-, which incorporates the quality differentials according to the quantile. Hence, it is possible to analyze the 
relationship between the explanatory variables  through different quality quantiles. The estimates of  both 
FE and 2SLS were made with the purpose of comparing and testing the robustness of the results. It can be 
seen that the coefficient for RCA is significant and maintains the same sign in these two estimates. 

As presented in Table 2, the results indicate that there is a positive relationship between the RCA 
and  the  export  quality.  This  result  was  also  found  by  Jaimovich  and  Merella  (2015)  and  Alcalá  (2008, 
2016). Nevertheless, this relationship was not significant only for the 0.25 quantile. In addition, it can be 
seen that the RCA coefficient is increasing as it moves towards the highest quantile. From this result, it is 
possible  to  infer  that  the  higher  the  quality  of  Brazilian  exports,  the  more  intensified  is  the  connection 
between RCA and quality. According to Alcalá (2016), producers in a country that have an advantage in a 
given sector will be, on average, more  efficient than producers in other countries. If greater efficiency is 
used to improve quality, then producers in this country and the industry will produce, on average, goods of 
higher quality than their competitors, because they already have an "initial advantage" - that is, a revealed 
comparative advantage in that industry.

The  coefficient of  the  distance  variable  (Table  2) obtained  the  expected  signal, 
indicating that, for more distant markets, that is, more difficult to be reached, Brazilian 
exports are of a higher quality. Such result was also found by Bastos and Silva (2010), 
Baldwin and Harrigan (2011), Verhoogen (2008) and Johnson (2012) for Portugal, the 
United States, Mexico and a group of 125 countries, respectively. For Bastos and Silva 
(2010), by considering the heterogeneity of firms, the result can be explained by the self-
selection of companies between destinations, with only higher quality producers entering 
more distant markets22. 

In the same table, the coefficient of the variable GDP was significant, at the level 
of 1%, and with a positive sign only for the 0.75 quantile indicating that the higher the 
income of the importing country, the higher the quality of Brazilian exports in the 0.75 
quantile. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that richer countries import better 
quality products because consumers are more demanding and demand better product.This 
result  was  found  by  Filho,  Medeiros  and  Albuquerquemello  (2017)  who,  despite  not 
having  performed  a  quantile  analysis,  also  found  a  positive  relationship  between  the 
importers' GDP and the quality of products exported by Brazil. 
 
Regarding the SPS and TBT variables, they were significant only for the 0.25 and 
0.50 quantiles. In general, the coefficients of the SPS measures had a positive sign and 
the TBT coefficient had a negative sign. This result suggests that the SPS measures help 
to increase the quality of Brazilian exports, while the TBT measures contribute negatively 
to the quality of exports. The measures may have ambiguous results on exports. On the 
one  hand,  they  comprise  changes  aimed  at  improving  hygiene,  technical  standards, 
reducing information asymmetry for consumers, among others. And, therefore, they are 
able to increase the quality of exported products, as verified for SPS. On the other hand, 
they can act as barriers to trade, given that  higher quality products already have higher 
marginal costs23, and an increase in these costs - due to the adequacy of the measure at 
some  stage  of  the  production  process  -  would  make  trade  in  these  goods  unviable, 
reducing the quality of exported products. Moreover, the incidence of SPS measures is 
generally higher also for agricultural products, which have lower "initial quality" in the 
sample.  For  this  reason,  the  initial  marginal  contribution  of  such  measures  on  quality 
tends to be higher. In addition, these products reach a larger number of destinations, most 
of  which  requiring  significant  adjustments,  which  may  translate  into  an  increase  in 
quality. 

Table 3 shows the unconditional quantile regression estimates for developed (1) 
and  developing  (2)  countries,  as  well  as  for  agricultural  (3)  and  industrialized  (4) 
products.  By  restricting  the  sample  for  observations  from  developed  countries,  the 
relationship  between  RCA  and  quality  intensified  in  the  lowest  quality  quantile, 
differently  from  the  estimation  with  the  complete  sample  (Table  2).  This  fact  can  be 
explained  by  the  composition  of  Brazilian  exports  to  developed  countries.  In  general, 
most  Brazilian  exports  of  agricultural  and  mineral  products  are  sent  to  richer  nations, 
products  in  which  Brazil  has  higher  RCA.  At the  same  time,  they  are  products  with  a 
lower degree of differentiation (reduced quality ladder) and can therefore influence the 
calculation of quality, contributing to a decrease in quality values. It is expected that in 
comparison to exports to more developed nations, agricultural products are present with 

                                                             
22 Baldwin and Harrigan (2011) have a theoretical model that relates the quality of products to distance, 
based  on  Melitz  (2003).  The  authors  show  that  the  highest  quality  products  are  more  expensive,  more 
profitable and can reach distant markets. 
23 See Baldwin and Harrigan (2011).

greater intensity in the lower band of the quality distribution. The relationship between 
RCA  and  quality  is  intensified  in  this  quantile,  corroborating  the  fact that the  country 
presents significant comparative advantages in the export of the agricultural sector. 

Brazil has a higher RCA in agricultural products, which may explain that the effect 
of this variable is more important in smaller quantiles. As one advances in higher quality 
quantiles,  the  depth  of  the  connection  between  an  advantage  in  production  and  its 
consequence in higher qualities dissipates. In the early stages of quality for these products, 
this relationship may be much more relevant, given the difficulty of increasing quality. 
However,  as  companies  improve  their  production  process  and  manage  to  increase  the 
quality  of  their  exports,  this  initial  contribution  of  RCA  diminishes  its  importance. 
Moreover, for developed countries, according to Table 3 (1), the same result was found, 
confirming the explanation. 

On the other hand, with regard to the relationship between the RCA and the quality 

of  industrialized  products  (4),  as  one  moves  towards  lower  quality  quantiles,  this   
connection becomes less pronounced. This means that this relationship is intensified in 
the highest quality quantiles, with the highest value of the  RCA coefficient for the 0.75 
quantile. This fact can be explained by Brazil's lower competitiveness in industrialized 
products.  Having  an  advantage  over  international  competitors  becomes  even  more 
necessary  as  better-quality  products  are  traded,  i.e.,  they  are  located  in  the  largest 
quantiles.

Table  4  presents  the  results  of  the  estimates  that  investigate  the  relationship 
between quality and the RCA for 14 sectors25 of the economy, based on the 2SLS model. 
The purpose of performing such an analysis is to try to understand how this association 
may differ depending on the characteristics of each sector. 

As shown in the table, for all sectors there was a positive relationship between the 
RCA and quality, with the exception of the Chemical and Related Products and Electrical 
Machinery and Equipment sectors. This result can be explained by the low average value 
of the RCA that these two sectors have and, even so, denotes a high-quality value (Table 
4). This  may  indicate high  investments in these sectors, since  it is possible to generate 
high-quality  products,  even  in  the  absence  of  significant  comparative  advantages.  The 
chemical products sector has grown in terms of world market power over the last decade. 
The  sector occupies  a  prominent  position,  being  the  ninth  in  the  world  ranking  of  net 
sales, only behind the United States, Japan, China, Germany, France, Korea, the United 
Kingdom  and  Italy  and  ahead  of  Russia,  India  and  countries  that  have  important 
companies  in  this  sector,  such  as  Belgium,  the  Netherlands,  Finland  and  Switzerland 
(GALEMBECK  et  al.,  2007).  Nevertheless,  the  sector  continues  to  present  successive 
deficits in the trade balance, which in 1997 was 4 billion dollars and in 2018 reached 25 
billion dollars (COMEX STAT, 2019). This may explain the fact that Brazil has low RCA 
and penetration values in other countries, resulting in a higher import for this sector. In 
regard to  the Electrical  Machinery  and  Materials  sector,  it  has  also  showed  successive 
deficits  and  reached  the  highest  value  in  2014  of  46  million  dollars  (COMEX  STAT, 
2019).

The sector that denotes the highest value of the relationship between quality and 
RCA  was  the  Transport  sector,  which  has  been  growing  considerably  throughout  the 
decade, mainly due to the increase in exports of airplanes and automobiles. Between 1997 
and 2016, vehicle exports maintained an annual  average of 10 billion dollars. Its main 
buyer is Argentina which, in 2016, acquired almost 60% of the cars exported by Brazil, 
followed  by  Mexico  (8%),  Chile  (6%)  and  the  United  States  (6%)  (COMEX  STAT, 
2019). The average quality of car exports to these countries is 7.20, while the average for 
other countries in the sample is 6.24. It is possible to note that higher quality products are 
exported to those countries that have a higher market share of Brazilian goods. 

Brazilian aircraft trade maintained an annual average of approximately 3 billion 
and  600  million  dollars  between  1997  and  2016.  The  main  importer  of  aircraft  is  the 
United States, which,  in 2016,  purchased  more than 65% of Brazilian exports of these 
products. China is also a major buyer, acquiring 7% of Brazilian aircraft exports in 2016, 
followed by Japan (4.5%), France (2.6%) and the Netherlands (2.2%) (COMEX STAT, 
2019). The average quality of aircraft exports to these main importing markets is 12.28, 
higher than to other destinations, which  is 10.25. In addition, the average  RCA of this 
product for these countries is 1.23, while for the other countries is 1.12. 

The second sector that presented the highest value of the relationship between the 
RCA and the quality of Brazilian exports was Animals and Animal Products. Within this 
sector, the product with the largest share is meat and offal (SH01), which has an annual 
average  export  value  of  547  million  dollars  between  1997  and  2016.  Brazil's  main 
importer of meat and offal is Hong Kong, with 15% of Brazilian exports in 2016. Next 
are  Saudi  Arabia  (10%),  China  (10%),  and  Egypt  (8%)  (COMEX  STAT,  2019).  The 
general quality of meat and offal is 7.58, while the quality of this product for the main 
importers is 8.46. In addition, the general  RCA for meat and offal is 0.47, while for the 
main importers it is 1.07. These results indicate that the higher the RCA of a product, the 
higher  the  quality  of  exported  goods.  And,  probably  due  to  this  higher  quality,  these 
products increase their market share for these countries. 

 
3.3  Effects  of  the  comparative  advantage  revealed  on  the  penetration  of 

Brazil's main trading partners 

In this section the estimates of the relationship between RCA and the penetration 
of Brazilian exports are shown in Table 5. It is believed that there is endogeneity between 
penetration and  RCA, thus, equation (7) was estimated through the 2SLS, for different 
groups of  the  sample.  It  is  noteworthy  that the  DWH  test  indicated  that,  in  fact,  there 
exists  an  endogenous  variable.  The  results  were  obtained  for  the  full  sample,  for 
developed and developing countries, for agricultural and industrialized products, and for 
14 sectors of the Brazilian economy. Based on the calculated F test, it was found that the 
instruments are strong26. In addition, equation (7) was estimated using the  FE panel  in 
order to  compare  the  models.  According  to Table  5,  it  is  possible  to  infer  that,  for  all 
regressions, there is a positive and significant relationship between penetration and RCA, 
as found in Jaimovich and Merella (2015). 

Based on Table 4, the association  between penetration and  RCA  is positive  for 
both agricultural  and  industrialized products. Having a higher  RCA  in a given product 
might indicate that it has a high degree of productivity when compared to other products. 
As presented in the previous section, this may translate into an increase in quality. As a 
consequence, Brazilian exports would be able to  penetrate more markets, regardless of 
the sector considered. 

                                                             
26 The value of the calculated F is greater than 10 for all endogenous variables.

The association between RCA and penetration is also positive for both groups of 
countries, but the coefficient was higher for developed nations. According to Jaimovich 
and Merella (2015), richer importers tend to increasingly specialize their consumption in 
varieties supplied by exporters that have a greater comparative advantage in the exported 
good sector. As consumers in developed countries purchase high quality varieties of each 
good,  suppliers  with  higher  productivity  are  better  able  to  exploit  their  growing  cost 
advantage  when  dealing  with  developed  importers.  The  marketing  of  higher-quality 
products  may  be  one  of  the  main  factors  contributing  to  a  greater  penetration  in  the 
imports  of  Brazil's  main  trading  partners.  According  to  Crinò  and  Epifani  (2012),  the 
improvement  of  quality  could  be  a  prerequisite  for  effective  access  to  the  markets  of 
richer countries. 

In regard to the income coefficient of the importing country, the results show that 
the higher the GDP, the lower the market penetration of Brazil's trade partners. This result 
is  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  higher  the  country's  income,  the  more  intense  is  the 
competition to reach these markets, making their penetration more difficult. In general, 
consumers in countries with higher income tend to be more rigorous and often demand 
more sanitary standards and/or better product specifications, which can make it difficult 
for Brazilian exports to enter these markets. This argument is corroborated by the result 
of  the  variable  representing  the  SPS  measures,  indicating  a  lower  penetration  in  their 
presence.  

According to the study by Jaimovich and Merella (2015), the negative relationship 
between  market  penetration  and  distance,  which  represents  the  costs  of  commercial 
transactions,  was  confirmed.  This  association  is  even  more  negative  when  it  comes  to 
industrialized products, considering that the international competition of these products 
is already fierce. The difficulty in penetrating other markets increases even more to places 
with greater distances, due to the higher cost embedded in such a transaction. 

As  opposed  to  the  results  found  for  quality,  the  higher  the  number  of  SPS 
measurements, the lower the penetration. These measures tend to reduce market entry, as 
evidenced in the work of Fontagné et al. (2015), who found that SPS measures negatively 
affect the intensive and extensive margins27.  

On  the  other  hand,  an  increase  in  the  number  of  TBT  measures  has  a  positive 
relationship with penetration. TBT measures can enhance products in order to influence 
an improvement in labeling, packaging, weights and measures, among others, even if, in 
the  estimate  shown  in  Table  5,  it  does  not  necessarily  mean  an  increase  in  quality. 
However, product entry into many countries requires cultural and language adaptations 
(related to  changes  in  packaging  and  labels  and  even  other technical  modifications)  in 
order to allow the product to be marketed in the country. This can translate into increased 
penetration, even if it does not modify quality. Consumers may prefer products with better 
technical  specifications,  causing  an  expansion  of  TBT  measures  to  increase  market 
penetration  by  Brazil's  main  trading  partners.  Or,  even  if  the  trading  partner  applied  a 
TBT, Brazil  may  be able to meet the requirements of this  measure and thus be able to 
have greater access to the main importing markets. 

                                                             
27 The intensive margin refers to the value of exports and the margin extends to the number of products 
traded.

Estimates similar to those shown in Table 5 were made considering 14 sectors of the economy, as 
verified  in  Table  6.  The  objective  of  this  analysis  is  to  try  to  understand  how  the  relationship  between 
penetration and RCA can be modified due to different characteristics among the sectors of the economy. It 
is noted that the association between penetration and RCA was significant and positive for all sectors, even 
for those that presented a negative relationship between quality and  RCA in Table 4. This suggests that, 
even with the specifics of each sector, the  link between revealed comparative advantage and penetration 
remains, indicating that those sectors that have a higher RCA will be able to access importing markets with 
more intensity. 

The  sector  of  Plastics  and  Rubbers  was  the  one  that  obtained  the  highest  coefficient  of  the 
relationship between RCA and penetration in the importing markets. Between 1997 and 2016, the average 
export of this sector was 282 million dollars, reaching 495 million in 2016. The main importing country is 
Argentina, which imported approximately 18% of the Brazilian exports in this sector in 2016. Next are the 
United States (14%), the Netherlands (10%), Belgium (7%) and Colombia (6%) (COMEX STAT, 2019). 
Among these countries, only Belgium is not in the sample composition of this work. The average quality 
of exports to all trading partners of plastics and rubbers is 5.13 while the average for the main importers is 
6. In addition, the average penetration of Brazilian exports of these products to all trading partners is 0.068, 
while the penetration for the main  importers of this sector is 0.13.  It  is possible to  perceive that, for the 
main importers of this sector, the products are of greater quality than the average and that greater penetration 
in these markets is reached. When considering the highest RCA values (greater than 3) for this sector, they 
are those that  have  a  penetration  above  the  general  average  (0.10)  and  also  a  quality  above  the  general 
average  (5.33).  This  suggests  that  products  that  have  a  higher  RCA  may  indicate  higher  values  of 
penetration and product quality. 

According  to  data  from  Comex  Stat  (2019),  the  Food  Products  sector,  between  1997  and  2016, 
obtained an annual export average of more than 1 billion dollars. The sector enjoys successive surpluses 
and,  the  year  of  2013  was  its  largest  contribution to the trade  balance,  with  more than  2  billion  dollars 
generated for the Brazilian economy. These data indicate a great advantage in the production of this sector. 
The main importers of Brazilian food products are the Netherlands, equivalent to 12% of exports in 2016 
in this sector, the United States (6%), France (5%), Germany (5%) and Thailand (5%). The highest RCA 
values (greater than 30) denote an average penetration of 0.30, while the general average penetration of this 
sector  is  0.12,  corroborating  the  results  found  that  a  higher  RCA  is  associated  with  the  expansion  of 
penetration of Brazilian exports in this sector. 

The Wood and Wood Products sector showed growing trade surpluses, mainly due to the growth of 
China, which is currently the main importer of this sector. While its exports presented an average annual 
growth of 7.25%, China exposed an average growth of Brazilian imports in this sector of 153%. Besides 
China, which imported 25% of Brazilian exports of wood and wood products in 2016, the United States is 
also a major buyer, consuming 15% of Brazilian exports. Next are the Netherlands (10%), Italy (8%) and 
Argentina (5%). Assuming the highest RCA values (above 10), the average penetration is 0.13, while the 
overall average for the sector is 0.09. 

The Stones and Glass sector exhibited an annual export average of 237 million dollars between 1997 
and 2016. Trade surpluses have been growing over the years, showing a growing advantage in the marketing 
of these products. The main importers are the United States, purchasing about 28% of this sector in 2016, 
followed by Canada (13%), Switzerland (10%), the United Arab Emirates (8%) and Hong Kong (7%). In 
the case of the highest RCA values of this sector (above 8), penetration showed an average of 0.17, in turn, 
the overall average is 0.078. Finally, it is confirmed that, for all sectors under analysis, when considering 
the highest RCA values, they exhibit a penetration higher than the general average of the sector in the main 
Brazilian importing markets.

4 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Brazil presented a great commercial expansion in the 2000s, but still very concentrated on products 
with lower added value. However, the country has little international insertion, having a small participation 
in world exports and imports. Thus, understanding the aspects that allow for greater international insertion 
and greater dynamism of exports becomes relevant, especially in the case of Brazil. 

This  study  relates  the  revealed  comparative  advantage  and  the  quality  of  exported  products,  in 
addition to the penetration in the main importing markets of Brazilian products, in the period from 1997 to 
2016.  The  results  show  the  relevance  of  the  revealed  comparative  advantage  to  determine  the  quality 
standards of the products marketed. Regardless of the income of importing countries or product groups, the 
results  suggest  that  there  is  a  positive  relationship  between  comparative  advantage  and  the  quality  of 
Brazilian exports. However, the intensity of this relationship varies according to the income group to which 
the  country  belongs  (developed  or  developing)  or  the  type  of  products  that  are  traded  (agricultural  or 
industrialized). The results also show greater market penetration of those products to which Brazil has the 
highest RCA. 

In addition, it was observed that countries with higher incomes absorb products of higher quality. 
On the other hand, penetration  in these countries is  lower, due to  greater competitiveness to  reach these 
markets. Thus, an intensification in the production of goods that Brazil has higher RCA can translate into 
higher quality and contribute to a greater penetration in important markets worldwide. In addition, more 
distant consumer markets have a lower penetration, that is, they are more difficult to reach. However, better 
quality products can reach markets with greater distance. 

Therefore, it is noted that, as in the work of Jaimovich and Merella (2015), there is an association 
between RCA, quality and penetration. Thus, RCA can function as a promoter of an improvement in quality, 
with  the  possibility  of  an  expansion  of  penetration  in  more  markets.  With  greater  penetration,  exports 
become  more  dynamic,  there  is  an  increase  in  income  acquired  through  international  trade,  there  is  a 
reduction in the dependence upon few importers (making exports less vulnerable to fluctuations in world 
markets), among others. Therefore, it is  important  for the government to think about  making the sectors 
more  competitive,  especially  the  industrial  one,  in  order  to  increase  the  comparative  advantage  in  the 

18 

 

production  of  these  goods,  since  this  is  positively  related  to  a  higher  quality  of  exports  and  a  greater 
penetration in international markets.
