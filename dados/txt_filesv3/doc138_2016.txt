Abstract 

The  study  investigates  the  importance  of  imported  intermediate  inputs  by  technological 
intensity, in the Brazilian processing industry for the years 2000, 2004 and 2009. It is used as 
database,  the  input-output  matrices  available  in  NEREUS  (Regional  and  Urban  Economics 
Laboratory, University of São Paulo). The sectors were aggregated and classified according to 
the  methodology  OECD  for  the  technological  intensity.  The  linkage  indices  of  Rasmussen-
Hirschman  and  the  sectors  of  influence  field  showed  that  when  the  imported  intermediate 
inputs are inserted in the production, there are significant improvements in the areas of high 
and medium-high technology, making clear that ceasing to import intermediate inputs in some 
sectors and starting to produce them internally could result in advantages for the country, in 
the internationally competitive sectors, for instance, the sectors 3 – Equipment for radio, TV 
and communication; 4 - Office and computer material; 5 – Machines and electrical devices; 6 
-  Vehicles,  trailers  and  semitrailers;  7  –  Chemical  products,  exclusive  pharmaceutical;  11  - 
Metal Products; 12 - Coal, refined oil products and nuclear fuel. 
Keywords:  Imported  Intermediate  Inputs,  Technological  Intensity,  Processing  Industry,

Resumo 

O  trabalho  busca  analisar  a  importância  e  consequências  dos  insumos  intermediários 
importados por intensidade tecnológica, na indústria de transformação brasileira, para os anos 
de  2000,  2004  e  2009.    Utiliza-se,  como  base  de  dados,  as  Matrizes  de  Insumo-Produto 
disponíveis  em  NEREUS  (Núcleo  de  Economia  Regional  e  Urbana  da  Universidade  de  São 
Paulo).  Os  setores  foram  agregados  e  classificados  de  acordo  com  a  metodologia  da  OCDE 
para intensidade tecnológica. Os índices de ligações de Rasmussem-Hirschman e o campo de 
influência  dos  setores  evidenciaram  que  insumos  intermediários  importados  inseridos  na 
produção, provocam melhorias significativas nos setores de alta e média alta tecnologia.  Fica 
claro que deixar de importar insumos intermediários em alguns setores e passar a produzi-los 
internamente  poderia  resultar  em  vantagens,  para  o  país,  em  setores  competitivos 
internacionalmente,  como  são  o  caso  dos  setores:  Equipamentos  de  rádio,  TV  e 
comunicações;  Material  de  escritório  e  informática;  Máquinas  e  equipamentos  elétricos; 
Veículos  automotores, 
semirreboques;  Produtos  químicos,  exclusive 
farmacêuticos;  Produtos  metálicos;  Carvão,  produtos  do  petróleo  refinado  e  combustível 
nuclear.

INTRODUCTION 
 

In  the  long  term,  the  process  of  exchange  appreciation  generates  change  in  the 
exporting agenda of a country in order to increase the export of primary goods and imports of 
manufactured goods, which causes a reduction in the participation of the manufacturing in the 
added value according to Marconi and Rocha (2012). The reasons that explain the increase in 
consumption by the families in Brazil also justify, directly or indirectly, the strong increase in 
imports, mainly when associated with other factors such as under-funding for expanding the 
industrial production capacity. This  situation is  similar to  that observed by  Britto  (2003) for 
Brazil  regarding  the  industrial  production  in  the  1990s,  which  also  depended  on  certain 
proportion  of  imported  inputs.  In  your  model,  the  industrial  production  increased,  but  with 
increases in imported components. 

According  to  the  authors,  the  real  exchange  rate  appreciated  in  emerging 
countries,  when  not  inactivated  by  the  managers  of  the  economic  policies,  ends  up 
discouraging exports of manufactured goods and encouraging the participation of the imports 
of  these  products  in  the  overall  supply  of  the  economy,  both  in  the  form  of  final  and 
intermediate  goods.  One  motivation  to  increase  the  imports,  in  this  scenario  of  exchange 
appreciation,  is  the  compensation  of  the  reduction  in  the  revenues,  in  Brazilian  Reais,  with 
exports, through the reduction of costs in Reais of the inputs imported in cheapest form. This 
process  can  reduce  the  participation  of  the  processing  industry  in  the  added  value, 
discouraging the exports of manufactured goods. 

In  addition,  it  is  considered  that  the  increased  use  of  imported  products  in  the 
production  process  would  result  in  gains  for  the  Brazilian  manufacturing  production,  given 
the embedded technology. The reduction in domestic production of intermediate goods used 
as inputs in the processing industry, resulting from the largest imports of this input, is largely 
offset  by  the  gains  in  production  of  final  goods.  Considering  that  the  intermediate  input 
presents  increasing  returns  to  scale,  which  cheapens  the  final  good  production  (since  the 
imported  input  purchase  is  more  advantageous  than  the  domestic,  given  a  cost  reduction  of 
this input through the rise in the exchange rate, for instance), it is expected an increase in the 
external demand for intermediate inputs imported. 

It  is  recognized  that  after  the  intensification  of  the  free-market  policies  in  the 
1990s, all developing countries started associating growth and development to their capacity 
to attract productive investments in knowledge- and technology-intensive sectors, in order to 
produce  goods  and  services  in  increasing  scale,  with  higher  added  value,  variety, 
diversification and technological sophistication. Thus, it is questioned: Were there production 
losses  or  gains  with  the  use  of  imported  intermediate  inputs  in  the  national  processing 
industry  during  the  periods  of  2000,  2004  and  2009?  In  case  of  losses,  what  has  been 
happening to the production structure of the Brazilian processing industry? 

The  replacement  of  the  use  of  manufactured  intermediate  inputs  produced, 
domestically,  by  imported  intermediate  inputs  promotes  the  discussion  on  the  transfer  of 
technology  from  advanced  to  developing  countries.  Thus,  this  study  analyzes  through  the 
Rasmussem-Hirschman  and  the  influence  field  indices,  the  importance  and  consequences  of 
the imported intermediate inputs by technological intensity. It is also showed in which sectors 
occur  improvements  in  the  amount  of  linkages  of  the  productive  chain  with  the  insertion  of 
intermediate  inputs  in  the  production.  To  achieve  this  objective,  sectors  were  classified

according  to  the  technological  intensity  defined  by  the  OCDE  and  it  was  used  the  Input-
Output  Matrix  (IOM)  available  in  NEREUS  (2013)  –  (Nucleus  for  Regional  and  Urban 
Economy of the University of São Paulo), being classified under a viewpoint of technological 
intensity.  It  is  also  worth  highlighting  that  the  assumption  of  economic  isolation,  with  the 
prohibition to import intermediate inputs, serves only as an exercise of analysis regarding the 
impact of the imported intermediate inputs on the sectors under research in the present study, 
within the Brazilian economy.  

In  addition  to  this  introduction,  the  study  presents  a  review  of  the  literature  on 
innovation and sectorial linkages, empirical studies on the use of imported intermediate inputs 
inserted  in  the  discussion,  and  the  results  of  the  interaction  between  imported  intermediate 
inputs  and  the  processing  industry  using  the  Rasmussem-Hirschman  and  influence  field 
indices. Finally, it will be made the concluding considerations. 
 
 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INNOVATION, SECTORIAL LINKAGES AND 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  

 
For  Schumpeter  (1982),  the  economic  development  depends  on  the  factor 
technology,  in  which  the  technological  innovation  is  responsible  for  the  rupture  and/or 
improvement of new techniques and production processes. The models developed by the neo-
Schumpeterian authors are based on the temporal interaction between the business strategies, 
in which are involved in a same market, added to the search process for innovations, and the 
selection process of these these innovations. 

Freemam  (1981)  incorporated  the  technical  progress  as  important  variable,  not 
only for the company growth, but also for the market as a whole. The author brought up basic 
characteristics of the strategies. The ideas of this author are interpreted within the theoretical 
structure of Schumpeter (1982), as being necessary mechanisms for a change contained in the 
concept  of creative destruction. Nelson and Winter (1982) agree with  Schumpeter (1982) in 
which only  the strongest  companies will survive  from  their  competitive advantages,  and the 
weakest will tend to disappear from the market. In order to continue growing, the companies 
must continue to search for innovations. 

Along  the  same  line  of  analysis,  it  is  added  that  the  products  and  processes  are 
developed in each company in different technological form, innovating whenever necessary. 
The  search  for  technological  improvements  in  the  companies  does  not  occur  through  the 
already  existing  knowledge,  but  from  it,  the  companies  in  the  search  for  new  technologies 
make the most appropriate choices. The companies search to improve, diversify and innovate 
their  technologies  only  in  the  areas  that  they  have  conditions  to  use  and  construct  a 
technological basis; to this end, they analyze the existing markets, their structures and forms 
of distribution, for instance. What the company can do, in the future, is closely conditioned by 
what  the  company  was  able  to  do  in  the  past.  This  approach  of  company  of  Dosi  (1984) 
resembles  the  approach  of  Schumpeter,  according  to  which  the  knowledge  and  innovation 
constitute  one  important  variable  to  the  acquisition  of  competitive  advantages  for  the 
companies. 

In Penrose (1995), innovations are also what generate competitive advantages for 
the company. They are fundamental for the acquisition of new knowledge or for introducing 
new  processes  and  services  in  the  company.  These  ideas  resemble  the  idea  of  Schumpeter, 
once  for  this  author,  the  innovations  are  responsible  for  the  creations  of  new  products  or 
production processes. The research of both authors on the companies relate to the exploration 
of  the  relationships  between  resources  and  profitability,  that  is,  the  corporate  profit.  For 
Penrose  (1995)  and  Schumpeter  (1982),  the  competition  based  on  the  imitation,  and  the 

 

4 

appropriation of the innovation returns, enable differences of profitability among companies 
and means for accumulating resources. 

From  the  pioneer  studies  of  Schumpter  on  the  role  of  the  innovation  in  the 
economic  development,  until  the  unfolding  of  these  studies  with  the  neo-Schumpeterian 
authors  relating  the  importance  of  innovation  to  the  company  and  to  the  economic 
development,  it  becomes  clear  that,  sectors  technologically  denser  have  better  conditions  of 
technological overflows, which in turn will depend on the sectorial relationships among their 
productive chains. In this respect, Hirschman (1958) was one of the pioneers who dealt with 
the economic development and the sectorial in backward and forward linkage direction. 

For  Hirschman  (1961),  the  development  depends  less  on  finding  optimal 
combinations  for  the  existing  resources  and  production  factors,  and  more  on  invoking  and 
enumerating  the  resources  and  abilities  that  lead  to  the  development  and  that  are  hidden, 
dispersed  or  misused.  For  the  author,  there  would  be  resources  whose  availability  would 
increase directly by their own use, thus highlighting the importance of learning as a form of 
magnifying  the  effects  of  feedback  and  chain  among  sectors.  For  the  author,  the  economic 
delay is due to the insufficient amount of decisions related to the development, and this would 
be  associated  with  the  generation  and  appropriate  direction  of  human  action.  In  the  case  of 
developing  countries,  the  difficulties  would  be  found  exactly  in  the  lack  of  coordination 
between  savings  and  investment,  that  is,  a  relationship  of  casualty  of  the  investment  on 
savings. The development  is  limited by the difficulties in  channeling the existing savings to 
the existing opportunities for productive investments and by the scarcity of abilities to make 
and implement development decisions. 

The development would be related to transformations or radical changes, in terms 
of “creative destruction” of Schumpeter (1982). According to the author, the mechanisms that 
lead  to  the  distancing  from  the  balance  are  exactly  those  that  would  form  an  appropriate 
standard  for  the  development  process.  In  other  words,  imbalances  are  what  trigger  changes, 
which  in  turn  would  result  in  new  imbalances.  In  the  case  of  underdeveloped  countries, 
balance  would  mean  to  remain  in  underdevelopment.  At  each  new  boost,  a  certain  sector 
would take the advantages of the foreign economy generated by a previous expansion, at the 
same  time  in  which  new  foreign  economies  would  be  created  by  this  sector  in  order  to  be 
explored by other sectors.  

In  line  with  the  effect  complementarity  of  the  investment,  Hirschman  (1958) 
defines  the  concepts  of  backward  and  forward  linkages6.  For  the  author,  the  backward 
linkages refer to any non-primary economic activity that will induce efforts to supply, through 
domestic  production,  the  necessary  inputs  to  that  activity.  On  the  other  hand,  the  forward 
linkages  are  any  activities  that,  by  their  very  nature,  do  not  meet  exclusively  the  final 
demands,  and  will  induce  efforts  so  that  their  products  can  be  used  as  inputs  in  some  other 
activities. 

Another  important  point  is  that  the  cumulative  character  of  the  development 
would  be  more  related  to  the  observation  of  the  linkage  effects  of  two  or  more  companies 
seen together than the effect of these companies in separate. For Hirschman (1961), given the 
potentiality  of  the  transforming  effects,  the  effects  of  backward  linkages  would  be  more 
important than the forward linkages. The forward linkage does not occur alone, the backward 
linkage, which would result in demand pressures, must always follow it. 

Thus,  according  to  Hirschman  (1961),  it  would  be  exactly  the  lack  of 
interdependence  and  linkages  among  the  sectors  that  form  the  economic  system  one 
characteristic of the underdeveloped countries. For the author, these countries would remain 
based on segments characterized by rare or weak effects  of linkages among sectors.  For the 
                                                           
6  The  issue  of  Hirschman's  work  (1961)  is  to  emphasize  sectoral  linkages,  causing  needs  of  their  positive 
dynamics versus, imports of inputs (embedded technologies) used in various sectors of the economy.

author,  the  imbalances,  if  well  understood  and  faced,  could  magnify  the  development  for 
causing  dynamic  effects  and,  regarding  the  overcoming  of  the  underdevelopment,  this  must 
come from the own unbalanced character of the development process. 
 
ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY AND DATA SOURCE 
 

For the input-output system, it can be observed as presented in Leontief (1988, p. 
10) that, the simplest form to describe the input-output matrix is to say that it shows the flows 
of goods and services among the several economic sectors during a particular period of time, 
in monetary terms. In other words, the matrix presents all buying and selling interrelationships 
(intermediate  goods,  final  goods,  added  value,  etc.)  of  a  given  economy.  The  basic 
relationship  can  be  seen  in  the  Box  1.1  and  in  a  more  complete  form  in  the  Box  1.2,  but  if 
only  three  sectors  (agricultural,  industrial  and  service)  are  considered.  More  specifically,  it 
should  be  remembered  that  “the  input-output  method  is  an  adaptation  of  the  neoclassical 
theory of  general  balance for the empirical  study of the quantitative interdependence among 
the interrelated economic activities” (LEONTIEF, 1988, p. 73). 
 
From  the  illustrations  of  the  Boxes  1.1  and  1.2,  it  is  possible  to  observe  three 
fundamental factors of the input-output analysis of Leontief (1988, p. 75-80): a) the technical 
or of input coefficients 
 (2) and c) the 

 (1); b) the matrix of technical coefficients 

inverse matrix (6) that bears its name,

As  presented  by  Chiang  and  Wainwright  (2006,  p.  110),  the  static  version  of  the 
Leontief  model,  under  which  this  study  is  guided,  has  the  following  research  problem: 
“Which product  level  each of the  n industries of an economy  should produce in  order to  be

exactly  sufficient  for  satisfying  the  total  demand  of  that  product?”  In  this  regard,  still 
according  to  the  authors,  given  some  assumptions  (presented  subsequently),  in  order  to 
produce  each  unit  of  the  jth  goods,  the  amount  of  input  for  the  ith  goods  has  to  be  fixed, 
according to the coefficient presented by the Equation (1). 

 

         (j = 1, 2, 3, ..., n ; i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n)                                 

 (1) 

Thus,  for  the  n  industries  meeting  sufficiently  the  demands  for  inputs  generated  by 
themselves and by others, as well as the final demand of an open economy, their product level 

 must satisfy the following equations (Chiang and Wainwright, 2006, p. 111-114):  

                                                                                         (2) 

in which, as presented in the Box 1.1., 

 represents the final demand of the sector i, 

 the 

gross value of production of the same sector and 

 the demand for input of the sector i by 

the sector j. 
By  rearranging  equations,  putting 

linear equations: 

  in  evidence,  it  is  observed  the  following  system  of  n 

                                                                            

(3) 

Written in matrix form:  

in which it can be rewritten as follows:  

                                                               (4) 

                                              (5) 

 
From the relationship (5) it can be deduced: 

                                                                                                               

(6) 

and thus it can be “(...) obtained the only system solution from the equation (...)” (Chiang and 
Wainwright, 2006, p. 112): 

                                                                                                           

(7) 

The  relationship  presented  in  (7)  summarizes  the  explanatory  power  of  the  input-
output analysis regarding the behavior of the economies. In other words, it is observed how an 
impact in the final demand (Y) affects the value of the production (X) and this, in turn, affects

other  variables  such  as  employment,  wage,  imports,  taxation  and  etc.  Thus,  it  is  possible  to 
observe the importance of this method to the countries. 

However, currently, the world wide calculated by Marcel P. Timmer (2012), presents a 

discrepancy in time of approximately 7 years (being the last occurring in 2011)  

In order to estimate the input-output system originally defined by Leontief, it was used 
the approach to the technology based on the industry, which assumes that the composition of 
the production of a given sector may change, however, this sector has to maintain its constant 
participation in  the market  of goods that this sector produces  (Miller  e  Blair, 2009).  For the 
matrix estimation with technology based on the industry, it is defined initially the matrices: 

                                                                                                                  

(8) 

                                                                                                                   

(9) 

in  which  B  represents  the  matrix  of  technical  coefficients  o  each  sector  in  relation  to  each 
product used as input, D determines the fixed proportion, for each product, of the sectors that 

produce them and B and D are composed, respectively, of the coefficients 

 e 

. 

The manipulation between these two matrices generates, as presented in  Guilhoto and Sesso 
Filho (2010), the following relationship: 

                                                                                                         

(10) 

Thus, the equation (10) refers to the sector-by-sector approach with the technology based on 
the  industry.  This  approach,  with  this  technology,  is  what  most  closely  approximates  to  the 
original  model  of  Leontief  and,  therefore,  is  the  standard  in  which  is  generally  used  to 
transform the matrices of production and of uses and resources in the model of Leontief. Note 
that, in this case, the matrix DB would be equivalent to the matrix A of technical coefficients 

of  Leontief,  thus 

  would  be  equivalent  to

,  which  is  the  inverse 

matrix of Leontief, being 

 its elements. 

In the case of the original matrix, U is uses and resources, Q is production and M is imports. 
Considering that, the matrix of imports available in NEREUS does not include the imports of 
final goods (vector), it can be assumed that the matrix of imports is composed of intermediate 
imported inputs.

Q 56 x110, in which Q is the matrix of production.

M 110 x 56 =  B 110 x 56  x  (diag m 1 x 56 ) 56 x 56   
X 1x56, in which X is a vector line 1x56, line 111 of the matrix U.

From  the  basic  model  of  Leontief  (Miller  and  Blair,  2009),  defined  previously, 
and following Rasmussen (1957) and Hirschman (1958), the sectors with the highest linkage 
degree within the economy can be determined, that is, it can be calculated both the backward 
linkage indices, which would provide how much such sector would demand from others, and 
the  forward  linkage  indices,  which  would  provide  the  amount  of  products  required  of  other 
economic sectors by the sector in question. 

Thus, from the equation (10) it is defined bij as an element of the inverse matrix of 
Leontief  B,  B*  as  the  average  of  all  elements  of  B  and  B*j,  and  B*i  as  the  sum  of  a  typical 
column and row of B, then the indices will be: 

Backward linkage indices, Uj = [B*j / n] / B* 
Forward linkage indices, Uj = [B*i / n] / B* 

in  which,  values  higher  than  1  of  the  indices  will  indicate  sectors  above  average  and, 
therefore, key-sectors for the economic growth. 

The influence field approach, developed by Sonis and Hewings (1989) and Sonis 
and Hewings (1994), aims at solving or minimizing problems presented by the linkage indices 
of  Rasmussen-Hirschman,  which  allow  evaluating  the  importance  of  the  impacts  of  each 
sector/product/input  on  the  economy.  However,  they  do  not  allow  determining  the  main 
connecting links, i.e., the relationships among the most important sectors within the economy 
and,  whose  variations  of  the  coefficients  would  have  greater  impacts  on  the  system. 
Therefore,  the  influence  field  approach  complements  the  analysis  of  the  backward  and 
forward linkage indices. 

The  matrix  of  technical  coefficients  of  production  A  =  |aij|  and  the  matrix  of 
incremental variations for the direct coefficients of input, E = |ij| are used for the calculation 
are  L = (I  A)-1 
of 
and L() = [I  A + )]-1  =  |lij()|.    According  to  Sonis  and  Hewings  (1989  and  1994),  if  the 
variation is low and occurs only in a direct coefficient, then:

that is, the greatest influence fields. 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 
This section of the study presents the linkages of the sectors and their importance 
within the Brazilian processing industry, with highlights to which sectors are considered key7 
sectors  and  which  sectors  would  be  positively  and/or  negatively  affected  if  intermediate 
inputs  would  cease  to  be  imported.  The  objective  was  to  show  which  sectors  would  be 
benefited  when  inputs  are  not  imported,  and  which  classification  of  technological  intensity 
would be these sectors. In order to initiate this analysis, it has also to be considered the value 
of  production  for  a  more  careful  verification,  because  there  may  be  sectors  that  are  not 
considered  keys,  but  they  have  high  volume  of  production,  generating  employments  and 
attracting investors, for instance. Therefore, certain volumes of production justify the special 
attention to this sector, whether forward or backward. 

The  Table  1  shows  the  value  of  the  production  in  the  Brazilian  processing 
industry  by  groups  of  technological  intensity,  2000,  2004  and  2009  and  for  instance,  the 
sector  23  –  Services  has  strong  forward  linkage  index  and  has  the  highest  volume  of 
production  among  the  sectors  analyzed.  Other  sectors  such  as:  15  -  Textile,  leather  and 
footwear;  21  –  Construction;  and  22  –  Commerce;  are  sectors  that  are  not  considered  key 
sectors, for not possessing forward and backward indices (higher than 1), but, they have high 
volume of production and, probably, generate a considerable volume of employment. 

The backward and forward linkage indices, and the total production in each sector 
for  the  year  2000,  are  presented  in  the  Table  2,  considering  and  not  considering  the 
intermediate  imported  inputs.  In  the  Table  2,  it  is  observed  that  the  sectors  that  can  be 
considered  key  sectors  were:  7  -  Chemical  products,  exclusive  pharmacists  (medium-high 
tech), 11 – Metallic products and 12 – Coal, products of refined oil and nuclear fuel (medium-
low tech), 17 – Wood and its products, paper and cellulose (low tech). These sectors possess 
forward  and  backward  linkage  indices  (higher  than  1),  and  therefore  are  considered  key 
sectors. 

 

 
 
 
 

                                                           
7 The contents of back links determine how much an industry demand of others, and indexes facing connections 
determine  how  much  an  industry  is  demanded  by  others.  Values  greater  than  1,  will  indicate  above  average 
sectors, and therefore key sectors for economic growth.

In  the  column  2  of  the  Table  2,  when  the  imports  of  intermediate  inputs  is 
replaced by the domestic production, an expressive change in the linkage indices mainly the 
backward indices occurs. Sectors previously considered keys start to present higher backward 
and forward indices, with the exception of the sector 17 – Wood and its products,  paper and 
cellulose, which is no longer a key sector. Sectors that were regarded as backward key sectors 
only,  remained  backward  key  sectors,  that  is,  they  became  stronger  (with  higher  linkage 
indices), when they ceased to import intermediate inputs. Such sectors are: 3 – Equipment for 
radio, TV and communication; 4 – Office and computer material; 5 – Machines and electrical 
devices;  6  –  Motor  vehicles,  trailers  and  semitrailers;  7  -  Chemical  products,  exclusive 
pharmaceutical;  8  –  Machines  and  mechanical  equipment;  11  -  Metallic  products;  and  12  – 
Coal,  refined  oil  products  and  nuclear  fuel.  It  can  be  noticed  that  there  was  increase  in  the 
value of the linkage indices of the key sectors, for both forward and backward, especially in 
the sectors of high and medium-high technology. These sectors started to produce more and to 
sell to other sectors and, thus, they reduced the foreign dependence of imported intermediate 
inputs. 

In the Table 2 such sectors are: 3 - Equipment for radio, TV and communication; 
4  –  Office  and  computer  material;  5  –  Machines  and  electrical  devise;  6  –  Motor  vehicles, 
trailers and semitrailers; 7 – Chemical products, exclusive pharmaceutical; 8 – Machines and 
mechanical equipment; 11 – Metallic products; and 12 - Coal, refined oil products and nuclear 
fuel.  It  can  be  noticed  that  there  was  increase  in  the  value  of  the  linkage  indices  of  the  key 
sectors,  for  both  forward  and  backward,  especially  in  the  sectors  of  high  and  medium-high 
technology. These sectors started to produce more and to sell to other sectors and, thus, they 
reduced the foreign dependence of imported intermediate inputs.

There are some points that  must be considered for a more careful verification of 
these  results.  First,  the  results  confirm  that  the  processing  industry  sectors  could  be  better 
articulated if there was no need to import intermediate inputs, that is, importing intermediate 
inputs cause a derangement among sectors. This lack of articulation was verified in the studies 
of  Chesnais  (1996);  Pacheco  (1996a  and  1996b);  Schor  (2004)  and  Breitbach  et  al  (2007). 
Second, it can be observed that the sectors considered of high, medium-high and medium-low 
technology  presented  better  linkage  among  sectors  when  the  intermediate  inputs  are  not 
imported. This can be verified observing the forward and backward linkage indices, when the 
values of the indices increase, in the column 2 of the Table 2, for the year 2000. On the other 
hand, in the sectors considered as being of low technology and in other non-industrial sectors, 
the values of the linkage indices decrease in all sectors, for both backward and forward, that 
is,  if  there  was  greater  incentive  in  the  production  of  intermediate  inputs  destined  for  the 
processing  industry,  internally,  the  sectors  that  would  improve  their  articulations  with  other 
economic sectors would be those classified as being of high, medium-high and medium-low 
technology.    

The values of the linkage indices of the Table 2  can be confirmed by  Sant”anna 
(2013), who found a linkage index of 1.31 for the sector 11 – Metallic products and 1.09 for 
the sector 17 – Wood and its products, paper and cellulose; and Bastos and Costa (2013), who 
also  found  linkage  indices  of  0.87  to  backward  and  0.61  to  forward  in  the  sector  1  – 
Pharmaceutical,  and  1.08  to  backward  and  2.08  to  forward  for  the  sector  7  –  Chemical 
products, exclusive Pharmaceutical.

The influence field for the year 2000 is presented in Graph 1, with the purchasing 
and  selling  sectors  for  the  24  aggregated  sectors  and  classified  by  technological  intensity, 
considering (Graph 1-A) and not considering (Graph 1-B) the imports of intermediate inputs. 

In  the  general,  looking  at  the  Graph  1,  when  it  is  not  considered  the  imports  of 
intermediate  inputs  in  the  production,  the  connecting  links  that  mostly  stand  out  are  in  the 
sectors of high and medium-high technology, that is, there is an improvement in the linkages 
of the sectors mainly in  the sectors of high and medium-high technology. This result can be 
viewed on both  sides, of the selling  and purchasing sectors.  It  is  noticed  that there is  also a 
change in the other sectors not classified by technological intensity, but with great importance 
within  the  economy,  such  as  is  the  case  of  the  sectors  18  –  Agriculture;  19  –  Extractive 
Industry and 20 - S.I.U.P, for instance.

In the Part A of the Graph 1, the sector 14 – Food, beverage and tobacco stood out 
as strong seller, that is, this sector has an intense relationship with the economic sectors in the 
forward  direction.  This  sector  sells  to  all  other  sectors.  As  to  the  sector  23  –  Services,  they 
stood out as purchasing sector. It purchases from all other economic sectors, presenting thus 
strong backward linkage. By considering the Part B of the Graph 1, it can be noticed a loss of 
linkage of the sector 14 – Food, beverage and tobacco. In other words, when the intermediate 
inputs are no longer imported, it was shown an improvement in other sectors of the industry, 
and the economy started to be less dependent on the sector 14 – Food, beverage and tobacco. 
As to the sector 7 – Chemical products, exclusive pharmaceutical, an increase in the linkages 
of the sectors from the purchaser side occurred: this sector started to have a better connection 
with the other economic sectors, when the imports of intermediate inputs were inserted in the 
production. 

This  improvement,  mainly  in  the  sectors  classified  by  technological  intensity  as 
being of high and medium-high technology, can be verified by the amount of connecting links 
between  sectors  and  their  linkages  in  the  year  2000.  It  can  be  verified  that  when  the 
intermediate  inputs  were  no  longer  imported,  the  connecting  links  were  increased.  This 
showed that a reduction in the imports of intermediate inputs strengthens internally the sectors 

 

13 

of  high  and  medium-high  technology.  As  to  the  sector  3  -  Equipment  for  radio,  TV  and 
communication, the fact of not importing intermediate inputs increased the links, from 5 to 10 
on  the  seller  side,  and  from  4  to  11  links  on  the  purchaser  side.  The  links  of  the  sector  7  – 
Chemical products, exclusive pharmaceutical, increased from 10 to 19 on the purchaser side. 
The  sum  of  the  connecting  links  is  always  higher  in  the  sectors  classified  as  being  of  high, 
medium-high  and  medium-low  technology,  and  lower  in  the  sectors  of  low  technology  and 
other  non-industrial  sectors,  when  the  intermediate  inputs  are  imported,  than  when  they  are 
not imported. In other words, there is an improvement in the industrial sectors technologically 
better classified, showing a potential gain of production with the internalization and incentive 
to the creation and development of technologies related to intermediate inputs. 

The forward and backward linkage indices for the year 2004 are presented in the 
Table 3. According to the presented methodology, those sectors that present indices above 1 
are considered key sectors. 

The  forward  and  backward  key  sectors,  in  the  year  2004,  were:  7  –  Chemical 
products, exclusive pharmaceutical; 11 – Metallic products and 12 – Coal, refined oil products 
and nuclear fuel. These sectors are strengthened in the forward and backward direction, when 
the  imports  of  intermediate  inputs  are  no  longer  considered.  The  sector  17  –  Wood  and  its 
products, paper and cellulose, considered as being a forward and backward key sector, ceases 
to be a sector key when the intermediate inputs are no longer imported.

Other sectors that have indices higher than 1, forward or backward, that is, strong 
on the seller side or on the purchaser side, improve their participation in the production when 
the imports of intermediate inputs are not considered. (sector 3 – Equipment for radio, TV and 

 

14 

communication,  which  for  instance,  is  increased  from  1.13  to  1.27,  without  the  imports  of 
intermediate inputs). Again, it is worth highlighting that the sectors: 15 -  Textiles, leather and 
footwear;  22  –  Commerce;  and    23  –  Services,  are  not  considered  key  sectors,  but  they 
possess large volume of production. 

In  2004,  in  comparison  with  2000,  it  was  verified  an  increase  in  the  entry  of 
imported intermediate inputs. First  due to  the low GDP growth,  in  2003, when compared to 
2004  and,  second,  due  to  an  exchange  rate  more  favorable    to  the  imports  in  general,  from 
2004, as highlights Lacerda and Nogueira (2010), with a overvaluation of the exchange rate of 
37%  from  2004  to  2007.  The  Table  3  shows  that  the  sectors  that  suffered  most  from  this 
increase in the imports of intermediate inputs were the sectors of high technology, mainly the 
sectors  1  –  Pharmaceutical  and  2  –  Medical  devices  for  optics  and  of  precision,  in  which  it 
can  be  observed  a  reduction  in  the  value  of  the  backward  and  forward  linkage  indices, 
showing difficulty to better articulate with the other economic sectors. 

The influence field for 2004 is presented in Graph 2, in which illustrates that, the 
tendency of when intermediate inputs are no longer imported, follows the same trajectory of 
2000, that is, when the imports of intermediate inputs is internalized, an improvement in the 
connecting links, for both forward and backward, occurs in the sectors classified as being of 
high and medium-high technology.

processing industry, 2004.

In the Part A of the Graph 2, it was verified that the sectors with  more linkages 
were  concentrated  in  the  sectors  of  medium-low  and  low  technology.  As  to  the  Part  B,  the 
linkages were concentrated in sectors of high and medium-high technology, indicating that the 
imports  of  intermediate  inputs  has  hampered  sectors  of  high  and  medium-high  technology, 
internally.  

Again, the sector 14 – Food, beverage and tobacco stood out as strong seller, that 
is, this sector has a strong relationship with all economic sectors in the forward direction. This 
sector sells to all other sectors, as can be seen in the Part A of the Graph 2.  The sector 23 – 
Services  stood  out  as  purchaser  sector,  in  which  purchases  from  all  other  economic  sectors, 
thus presenting strong backward linkage. Other two highlights, which did not appear in 2000 

 

15 

and started to stand out in 2004, were the sectors: 10 – Non-metallic mineral products as great 
seller and 18 – Agriculture as great purchaser. 

By looking at the Part B of the Graph 2, it can be noticed a loss of linkages of the 
sector  14  –  Food,  beverage  and  tobacco,  that  is,  when  intermediate  inputs  are  no  longer 
imported, it shows an improvement in other sectors of the industry, and the economy starts to 
be  less  dependent  on  this  sector.  Also  for  the  sector  7  –  Chemical  product,  exclusive 
pharmaceutical,  an  increase  occurred  in  the  linkages  of  the  sectors  on  the  purchaser  side. 
Hence, this sector starts to connect better with the other economic sectors, when the imports 
of  intermediate  inputs  is  internalized.  The  sector  7  –  Chemical  products,  exclusive 
pharmaceutical  was  consolidated  even  more  as  seller  sector,  starting  to  connect  with  all 
economic sectors. As to the sector 18 – Agriculture, it ceased to be purchaser of all the other 
economic sectors, that is, when intermediate inputs are no longer imported it can be observed 
an improvement in the sector 18 – Agriculture, because this is no longer dependent on all the 
other economic sectors, as shows the Part A of the Graph 2. 

It can be verified the same tendency of 2000, that is, when the intermediate inputs 
are no longer imported, the connecting links are increased, mainly in the sectors classified by 
technological intensity such as those of high and medium-high technologies. The decrease in 
the  imports  of intermediate  inputs  strengthened,  internally,  the  sectors  of  high  and  medium-
high  technology.  As  to  the  sector  3  –  Equipment  for  radio,  TV  and  communication,  for 
instance, the fact of not importing intermediate inputs increased the links from 4 to 7, on the 
seller  side  and  from  2  to  5  link  for  the  purchaser  sectors.  For  the  sector  7  –  Chemical 
products, exclusive pharmaceutical, the links increased from 8 to 14, in the purchaser sectors.

The  forward  and  backward  linkage  indices,  for  the  year  2009,  can  be  seen  in 
Table 4, and show that, in general, they contain few alterations in relation to the analyzed in 
2000  and  2004.  The  forward  and  backward  key  sectors  were:  7  -  Chemical  products, 
exclusive  pharmaceutical;  11  -  Metallic  products  and  12  –  Coal,  refined  oil  products  and 
nuclear  fuel.  For  these  sectors,  when  the  imports  of  intermediate  inputs  are  no  longer 
considered, they are strengthened in the forward and backward direction. 

The sector 17 – Wood and its products, paper and cellulose, considered a forward 
and backward key sector in 2000 and 2004, ceases to be key sector in 2009. Other sectors that 
have  forward  or  backward  indices  higher  than  1,  that  is,  strong  on  the  seller  or  on  the 
purchaser  side,  improved  their  participation  in  the  production  when  the  imports  of 
intermediate  inputs  were  no  longer  considered:  the  sector  3  –  Equipment  for  radio,  TV  and 
communication,  for  instance,  was  increased  from  1.11  to  1.22,  without  the  imports  of 
intermediate inputs. The sector 23 – Services possesses strong forward linkage (index above 
3), in the three years of analysis. 

The influence field, in 2009, can be seen in Graph 3, where it is observed the same 
tendency  in  relation  to  the  found  in  2000  and  2004,  when  the  intermediate  inputs  were  no 
longer imported.

processing industry, 2009.

By  internalizing  the  imports  of  intermediate  inputs,  it  occurs  an  improvement  in 
the  linkages  of  the  sectors,  for  both  forward  and  backward  linkages,  mainly  in  the  sectors 
classified  as  being  of  high  and  medium-high  technology.  By  looking  at  the  Part  A  of  the 
Graph 3, the sectors with higher linkages are concentrated in the sectors of medium-low and 
low technology. As to the Part B of the Graph 3, the linkages are concentrated in sectors of 
high and medium-high technology. 

As  seen  in  2000  and  2004,  also  in  2009,  the  sector  14  -  Food,  beverage  and 
tobacco,  was  associated  with  all  the  economic  sectors  in  the  forward  direction.  This  sector 
sells  to  all  the  other  sectors;  ass  can  be  seen  in  the  Part  A  of  the  Graph  3.  In  addition,  the 
sector  23  –  Services  maintained  its  prominence  as  sector  purchaser  from  all  the  other 

 

17 

economic  sectors,  thus  presenting  strong  backward  linkage.  The  sector  18  –  Agriculture 
showed to be a great purchaser. 

By looking at the Part B of the Graph 3, it can be noticed an improvement in the 
linkages of the sector 7 – Chemical products, exclusive pharmaceutical, on the purchaser side: 
this  sector  started  to  connect  better  with  the  other  economic  sectors,  when  the  imports  of 
intermediate inputs were internalized in the production. As to the sector  18 – Agriculture, it 
maintained  the  linkage  as  purchaser  from  all  the  other  economic  sectors.  The  sector  23  – 
Services acted as purchaser from all the other economic sectors, both in the Par  A and B of 
the Graph 3, in 2009.  

It  can  be  verified  that  it  follows  the  same  tendency  of  2000  and  2004,  that  is, 
when  intermediate  inputs  were  no  longer  imported,  the  connecting  links  were  increased, 
mainly in the sectors classified by technological intensity as being of high and medium-high 
technology. The reduction in the imports of intermediate inputs strengthens, internally, sectors 
of  high  and  medium-high  technology.  As  to  the  sector  3  –  Equipment  for  radio,  TV  and 
communication, for instance, the fact of not importing intermediate inputs increases the links 
from 2 to 5 on the seller side, and from 2 to 4 links, for the purchaser sectors. The sector 7  - 
Chemical  product,  exclusive  pharmaceutical,  maintained  in  7  the  links  in  the  purchaser 
sectors. 

Thus,  the  values  found  in  this  study  help  to  better  understand  the  ideas  of  Cano 
and Silva (2010), where the authors stress the need for a government policy built from a view 
of the complexity of the productive structure of the country and  supported by the perception 
that the several sectors and productive chains play differentiated roles in the dynamics of the 
development,  in  terms  of  generation  and  dissemination  of  innovations,  competitiveness  and 
international dynamism and fulfillment of the basic needs of the population. Still according to 
the authors, there is a clear need to design a contemporary industrial and technological policy, 
in  a long-term  perspective, emphasizing the dimension of innovation  and the aggregation of 
technology to the Brazilian products. 

It  is  necessary  to  consider  the  positive  effect  in  relation  to  the  transfer  of 
technology, when the intermediate inputs are commercialized with  the advanced economies, 
for  instance.  However,  according  to  Pacheco  (1996),  it  is  important  to  pay  attention  to  the 
effects  of  the  trade  opening  of  the  country,  from  the  new  international  competitive 
environment, they tend to be very negative for the Brazilian regions that are not integrated to 
the international market. For the author, the highest competitiveness of the industry is reached 
through the weight increase in the imported component, weakening the internal inter-industry 
nexus  of  the  country,  and  reducing  the  linkage  effects.  The  result  is  lower  aggregation  of 
added value and discouragement of the growth of the national economy. 

 
It  is  also  consensus  that  the  transfer  of  technology  through  the  imports  of 
intermediate  inputs  and  the  international  trade  with  P&D-intensive  countries  (technological 
leaders) brings benefits to any country that connects with the advanced economies. However, 
for  Brazil,  it  can  also  be  verified  an  imbalance  among  the  sectors,  through  the  reduction  of 
linkages when the imports of intermediate inputs are considered. However, it is important to 
emphasize that Lööf and Andersson (2008) stress that the imported inputs can be better than 
the  national  inputs  and  that  the  international  trade  can  benefit  the  importer  countries  with 
access to new products or new varieties of existing products. For the authors, greater access to 
new  imported  inputs  and  equipment  can  increase  the  productivity,  and  the  best  technology 
incorporated  to  the  imported  inputs  can  allow  the  companies  to  improve  the  methods  of 
production. Kasahara and Rodrigues (2007) showed a positive impact from the use of foreign 
intermediate  inputs  for  the  company  productivity  in  the  case  of  Chile.  Zaclicever  and 
Pellandra (2012) found evidence of a positive effect between the increase of foreign inputs in 

 

18 

the  Uruguayan  industrial  enterprises  and  the  productivity  during  1997-2008,  which  is 
positively related to the technology incorporated in the imported inputs. 

 In line with the ideas of Chesnais (1996), the results of this paper for Brazil show 
that,  when  the  intermediate  inputs  of  high  and  medium-high  technology  are  no  longer 
imported,  these  sectors  become  better  articulated  among  them,  show  an  improvement  in  the 
indicators of Rasmussem-Hirschman and a lower dependence of the country in relation to the 
intermediate  inputs  imported.  According  to  Pacheco  (1996a  and  1996b),  the  higher 
competitiveness of the industry is achieved through the increase of the weight of the imported 
component,  weakening  the  internal  inter-industry  links  of  the  country  and  reducing  the 
linkage effects. The result is a lower aggregation of value and discouragement of the growth 
of the national economy. 

The  results  of  Rodrigues  et  al  (2013)  show  tendency  of  positive  gains  in  the 
capacity  of  the  Brazilian  economy  to  generate  added  value  and  a  lower  dependence  on  the 
imports  of  intermediate  inputs,  mainly  by  the  sectors  technologically  advanced,  when  they 
studied  the  foreign  dependence,  generation  of  added  value  and  structural  change  in  Brazil, 
using  data  of  MIP  structured  in  42  sectors  subdivided  into  three  sub-periods:  1995  a  2000; 
2001 a 2005; and 2006 a 2009. According to the authors, a lower number of sectors began to 
require large increase in the global production to raise, in one unit, their final demands at the 
same  time  in  which  more  sectors  reduced  their  external  dependence  relatively  to  imported 
inputs. These results, found by the authors, are convergent with the results found in this study, 
in  the  sense  that  a  reduction  of  intermediate  inputs  imported  has  positive  impacts  on  the 
production  of  the  Brazilian  economy,  mainly  for  the  sectors  of  high  and  medium-high 
technology.  
 
 
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 

 
The results found in this study show that all sectors cease to gain in production by 
importing  intermediate  inputs,  and  begin  to  encourage  the  production  of  these  inputs 
internally.  Thus,  there  is  a  production  improvement,  mainly  in  the  sectors  of  high  and 
medium-high technology, and this becomes clear graphically in the results, showing that there 
were  gains  in  linkages  among  sectors  and  in  all  sectors,  mainly  of  high  and  medium-
technology.  These  linkage  gains  can  also  be  observed  through  the  increase  in  the  linkage 
indices  of  Rasmussem-Hirschman,  when  the  imports  of  intermediate  inputs  are  no  longer 
considered. 

Thus,  it  can  be  noticed  that,  for  the  Brazilian  processing  industry,  the  initial 
hypothesis  is  confirmed,  that  is,  the  hypothesis  that  the  intensification  of  the  free-market 
policies,  occurred  as  from  1990,  by  contributing  to  an  increased  international  competition, 
increased the access  of the Brazilian industries to import intermediate inputs mainly of high 
and  medium-high  technology.  The  results  showed  that,  these  imported  intermediate  inputs 
inserted in the production, cause significant improvements in the sector of high and medium-
high technology.  It becomes clear that ceasing to import intermediate inputs in some sectors 
and to  begin  producing them  internally  could  result in  advantages for the country in  sectors 
internationally competitive, such as the case of the sectors: 3 – Equipment for radio, TV and 
communication;  4  – Office and computer material; 5  – Machines and electrical  devices;  6  – 
Motor vehicles, trailers and semitrailers; 7 – Chemical products, exclusive pharmaceutical; 11 
– Metallic products; 12 – Coal, refined oil products and nuclear fuel.
