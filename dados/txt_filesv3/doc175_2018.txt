Abstract: To accomplish climate agreements, Brazil  intends to raise the share of renewables, other than 
hydropower,  in  electricity  supply.  According  to  the  Brazilian  Decennial  Energy  Plan  (PDE  2026),  the 
country will expand its installed capacity mostly by investments in gas, wind and solar sources. However, 
areas  suitable  for  those  projects  are  regionally  concentrated  and,  in  some  cases,  in  the  poorest  regions 
such as the Northeast.  Hence, the expansion of power supply also entails economic and regional  issues. 
We  explore  this  topic  analyzing  the  economic  and  regional  impacts  of  the  investments  in  electricity 
generation,  under  various  policy  scenarios  provided  by  the  PDE  2026.  For  that,  we  apply  a  regional 
recursive-dynamic  CGE  model  for  Brazil,  TERM-BR10,  specially  enhanced  to  deal  with  electricity 
features.  Our  results  show  that  a  supply  plan  with  more  insertion  of  solar  source  could  increase  the 
national  GDP  by  0.45%  and  by  2.3%  in  specific  regions.  They  also  show  that  a  scenario  without  new 
hydro dams does not imply in economic loss, in terms of national GDP or employment. We also came to 
the conclusion that policy guidelines have welfare and distributive benefits, with greater impact to poorest 
regions and low income households.

Resumo: Para atender os seus compromissos climáticos, o Brasil planeja elevar a participação das fontes 
renováveis,  além  da  hidrelétrica,  na  oferta  de  eletricidade.  Segundo  o  Plano  Decenal  de  Expansão  de 
Energia (PDE 2026), a expansão da capacidade instalada será predominantemente com investimentos na 
geração  à  gás,  eólica  e  solar.  No  entanto,  as  áreas  disponíveis  e  aptas  para  tais  projetos  estão 
concentradas, em sua maioria, nas regiões com  menor PIB  per capita, a exemplo da Nordeste, de modo 
que  a  expansão  da  capacidade  instalada  tem  implicações  econômico-regionais.  O  trabalho  analisa  essa 
questão  com  o  objetivo  de  verificar  quais  os  impactos  econômicos  e  regionais  dos  investimentos  em 
geração  de  energia  elétrica,  com  base  nos  cenários  de  expansão  delineados  no  PDE  2026.  Para tanto,  é 
utilizado o TERM-BR10, modelo computável de equilíbrio geral, regional, dinâmico-recursivo e com um 
módulo específico para simulações com o setor elétrico. Os resultados indicam que um plano de expansão 
com  maior  inserção de geração solar pode impactar elevação de 0,45% no PIB brasileiro e de até 2,3% 
em  regiões  específicas.  Também  verificamos  que  um  cenário  sem  novas  usinas  hidrelétricas  não 
implicam  perdas,  em  termos  de  PIB  ou  emprego,  ao  país.  Ademais,  evidenciou-se  que  as  diretrizes  de 
política  inseridas nos cenários alternativos do PDE têm benefícios distributivos, com  impactos positivos 
maiores para as regiões mais pobres e famílias com renda mais baixa.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Brazil  committed  in  the  21st  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  (COP21)  to  reduce  its 
greenhouse gas emissions by 37% below 2005 levels in 2025, via controlling deforestation and increasing 
the  share  of  sustainable  biofuels  in  energy  mix  and  the  share  of  renewables,  other than  hydropower,  in 
power supply (BRASIL, 2015). Although these commitments are not an obligation, it has been acting as a 
guideline for policymakers and the country has recently reinforced its position at international meetings, 
such as COP22. 

In  the  electricity  sector,  specifically,  Brazil  proposes  to  accomplish  the  agreement  mostly  by 
raising  the  share  of  wind  and  solar  generation  in  the  electricity  mix.  According  to the  newest  Brazilian 
Decennial  Energy  Plan (PDE 2026), during the period 2017-2026, the country should  more than double 
its installed capacity for wind power (184.0%) and drastically increase its capacity for solar (45900.0%). 
Meanwhile, it also intends to reduce the share of oil and diesel sources, cutting off about 52% and 60% of 
its  installed  capacity,  respectively.  As  a  result, the  country  should  achieve  in  2026  an  electricity  matrix 
with 81% of renewables, composed by 54% of hydro, 14% of wind, 8% of biomass and 5% of solar. Non-
renewables sources should represent about 19% and consist mainly of gas (EPE, 2017). 

To  support  this  expansion,  the  country  should  invest  about  R$  174  billion  (US$  53  billion) 
directed  only  for  new  projects  whose  start  up  date  is  after  2020  (EPE,  2017).  Geographically,  the 
locations  with  potential  for  wind  and  solar  energy,  and  therefore  with  more  investments,  are  mainly 
located in the poorest areas of Brazil such as the Northeast region.  It means that the Brazilian Decennial 
Energy Plan and the investments in renewable sources are not only a climate and an energy concern, but 
also entails important economic issues such as regional inequality and development. 

Despite this relevance, there is still a scarce literature on this topic in Brazil. Previous studies were 
mostly  focus  on  the  implication  of  investments  in  renewable  electricity  on  jobs,  such  as  Pereira  et  al 
(2013)  and  Simas  and  Pacca  (2013;  2014),  and  the  economic  consequences  of  reducing  emissions 
(Instituto Escolhas, 2017). Internationally, the impact on jobs has been widely discussed (UK, 2014; Lehr 
et  al,  2008;  Moreno  et  al,  2008)  and  some  works  have  extended  the  analysis  to other  variables  such  as 
GDP (Pollin et al, 2009; Dai et al, 2016). Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, regional analysis is still an 
absence.  

This  study  aims  to  fill  this  gap  by  applying  a  regional  recursive-dynamic  CGE  model,  TERM-
BR10, to evaluate the economic  and regional  implications of the investments in electricity generation  in 
Brazil.  Our  purpose,  specifically,  is  to  examine  economic  impacts  of  the  investments  under  various 
scenarios described by the PDE 2026, focusing on its different effects on GDP, employment, production, 
among  others  variables.  This  allows  us,  for  example,  to  understand  if  an  electricity  mix  with  more 
renewable sources implies in economic benefits to the country and specific regions or not. 

The remainder of this paper is structured as follow: section 2 contains a brief description about the 
Brazilian Decennial Energy Plan, PDE 2026, and its electricity supply scenarios; section 3 describes the 
economic  model  (TERM-BR10)  and  the  methodology  applied  to  compute  our  policy  shocks  as  well  as 
the simulation strategy; while the section 4 present our results. Section 5 reports our final remarks. 

 

 

2.  THE BRAZILIAN DECENNIAL ENERGY PLAN – PDE 2026 

2.1 Overview 

The Brazilian Decennial Energy Plan is a document elaborated by the Brazilian Ministry of Mines 
and Energy (MME) to provide information for society and investors regarding government standpoint for 
energy  supply  and  demand  10  years  ahead.  Although  not  deterministic,  the  plan  provides  the  Federal 
Government approach for energy efficiency, energy and electricity demand, fuels and electricity supply,

investments  and  environmental  analysis  of  planned  energy  matrix.  The  document  is  usually  published 
annually  and  also  contains  supplementary  material  and  technical  reports  describing  the  methodology, 
environmental analysis and others specific issues. The most recent Brazilian Decennial Energy Plan, PDE 
2026, covers the period of 2017-2026. 

The analysis of electricity sector consists of a demand forecast, developed under macroeconomics, 
demographics  and  electricity  efficiency  assumptions,  and  a  supply  plan  specifying  an  electricity  mix  to 
support that demand. In order to determine the supply, the planners subject projects suitable for expansion 
or  construction  to  an  investment  model  that  optimize  the  minimum  cost  mix  (construction  and 
operation)2. Exogenous constraints, such as policy guidelines, are inputs to the optimization process. The 
optimum  mix  is  then  subject  to  additional  constraints  (those  not  handled  by  the  investment  model)  and 
simulations. After adjustments, the supply plan is ready for evaluation by policymakers. (Figure 1)

In  this  process,  PDE  2026  innovates  providing  not  one  but  various  optimums  mix  considering 
uncertainty and different environmental and energy restrictions. Supply alternatives for situations with no 
new hydro dams (not already contracted) in the electricity mix or with a reduction in cost for solar source 
are provided. An electricity mix developed without policy intervention is also available. 

 

2.2 Economic assumptions and supply scenarios 

PDE  2026  and  its  demand  forecast  were  developed  under  demographic  and  economic 
assumptions.  The  plan  considers  that  the  Brazilian  population  will  keep  growing,  but  under  decreasing 
rates.  During  the  period  2017-2026  it  is  expected  to  have  an  average  growth  rate  of  0.6%  a  year.  This 
corresponds  to  an  addition  of  13  million  habitants  by  the  end  of  the  period.  Regionally,  the  North  and 
Midwest  regions  should  growth  at  higher  rates.  However,  not  enough  to  cause  significant  changes  in 
demographic distribution (EPE, 2017). 

In economy, PDE 2026 assumes a growth rate of 3.8% annually for world’s GDP and of 4.0% for 
the  international  trade.  Due  to  economic  and  political  conditions,  is  expected  for  Brazil  a  smooth

recovery. For 2017-2026, it is assumed an average rate of 2.5% for Brazilian GDP. Nevertheless, by the 
end of this period the economy should increase about 3.0% per year3.  

The electricity demand is driven by those economic and demographic assumptions. EPE estimates 
for the reference scenario an average increase of 3.7% in the electricity consumption during the period of 
2017-2026,  and  of  3.5%  for  electricity  demanded  in  the  national  grid.  On  the  supply  side,  the  plan 
published one reference scenario and seven alternative supply plans, considering uncertain conditions, the 
called  “what-if”  scenarios.  However,  detailed  information  by  source  is  only  provided  for  six  of  them, 
restricting, a priori, our analysis to those cases4. 

Among these options, we restricted our study to four scenarios: Case 1 - reference scenario, Case 
4 - solar expansion, Case 5 - no new hydro dams, and Case 8 - directed expansion. This choice was based 
on the  fact that these scenarios share the same economic and electricity demand assumptions as well as 
exogenous constraints (Figure 2). Hence, they are comparable. Besides, they embody relevant policy and 
environmental  issues,  such  as  hydrologic  scarcity,  more  rigorous  conditions  for  environmental  licenses 
and  huge  increase  in  renewable  sources.  These  make  the  investigation  of  the  economic  implications  of 
these  scenarios,  and  the  differences  between  them,  quite  interesting  for  Brazil,  especially  in  regional 
level. 

The expansion of installed capacity, in every case, consists of projects already contracted5, which 
basically  support  the  additional  supply  until  2020,  and  new  projects  considered  for  2020-2026.  For this 
last period, projects (and sources) could be different between scenarios due to specific policy guidelines 
considered in each Case (Figure 2). Therefore, differences between Cases are only related to the planned 
expansion. 

For each one of those scenarios, PDE 2026 has a detailed expansion by source, year and location 
at  macro  regional  level  (Table  1).  It  is  important  to  highlight that  even  established  to  support  the  same 
demand,  the  total  expansion  of  installed  capacity  is  slightly  different  between  scenarios  due  to  the 
peculiarities  of  the  sources  considered  in  each  case.  Consequently,  the  total  amount  of  investment 
estimated for that is also different (Table 1).

The TERM model was originally developed for Australia in earlies 2000 by the Centre of Policy 
Studies. Since then, different versions of the model have been adapted for other countries, such as China, 
Brazil,  Indonesia  and  USA,  to  analyze  policies  related  to  environment,  migration,  trade  and  other

subjects6.  Our  CGE  model,  the  TERM-BR10,  belongs  to  this  family  and  is  the  most  recent  version  of 
TERM for Brazil. 

The  TERM-BR10  is  a  regional,  bottom-up  and  multi-period  (recursive  dynamic)  computable 
general equilibrium model, based and closely similar to its predecessor, the TERM-BR. The data structure 
and  the  core  theory  behind  the  model  (equations,  agents’  behavior,  trade  matrix)  were  described  by 
Horridge (2011) and others papers such as Horridge et. al. (2005), Horridge & Wittwer (2010) and Witter 
&  Griffith  (2011).  Regarding  Brazil,  several  applications  were  made  as  Ferreira  Filho  and  Horridge 
(2006, 2010, 2014, 2016) and Diniz and Ferreira Filho (2015). Therefore, in this paper our focus is on the 
updates,  improvements  and  modifications  incorporated  by  TERM-BR10,  mostly  regarded  to  the  new 
database and the electricity data and mechanism. 

The  model  is  calibrated  based  on  the  2010  Brazilian  Input-Output  table  (while  the  previous 
TERM-BR  use  2005  database).  The  IO  table  covers  67  sectors  and  127  commodities.  The  electricity 
(sector  and  commodity)  comes  aggregated  with  gas,  water  and  other  utilities.  This  format  lacks 
generation details and, consequently, it is not appropriate to  work with electricity sector in Brazil due to 
its diversified electricity mix. 

To  solve  that  we  used  data  from  the  Brazilian  Energy  Balance  (BEN  2016)  to  disaggregate  the 
sector (and the commodity) into 12 different activities/products: one for gas distribution, one to represent 
electricity  transmission  and  distribution,  and  10  different  electricity  generations  –  wind,  solar,  hydro, 
biomass  (sugar),  biomass  (ethanol),  thermal  (oil),  thermal  (diesel),  thermal  (coal),  thermal  (gas),  and 
others  generations.  Also  we  split  the  Petroleum  and  Natural  Gas  sector  (and  product)  into  two 
sectors/products,  respectively.  Then,  our  initial  database  consist  of  136  commodities  and  76  sectors. 
Finally, we transform our Make matrix to a commodity x commodity diagonal table (136 x 136)7.  

The  TERM-BR10  is  representative  of  the  27  Brazilian  regions:  26  regions  and  the  Federal 
District. Regional supplies (or production) were obtained splitting the  national production using official 
information  from  the  2010  Municipal  Agriculture  Survey  (PAM/IBGE),  the  Brazilian  Energy  Balance 
(BEN  2016),  and  the  Cadastro  Central  de  Empresas  (CEMPRE/IBGE),  among  other  official  sources. 
Local  demand  was  estimated  using  the  2008  Brazilian  Expenditure  Survey  (POF  -  Pesquisa  de 
Orçamentos  Familiares,  published  by  IBGE).  The  27  regions  were  linked  through  large  trade  matrices, 
estimated  based  on  local  supply  and  demand  estimates  using  a  gravitational-like  type  method,  as 
described by Horridge (2011). 

To split the Input-Output investment vector between our 136 industries, we use information from 
Miguez  (2016).  To  our  best  knowledge,  this  is  the  most  recent  and  the  only  work  which  estimate  an 
investment absorption matrix for 2010 Brazilian IO table. Even though, for the electricity sectors we use 
additional  information  such  as  Tourkolias  et  al  (2014),  Cansino  et  al  (2014),  Cursino  Neto  (2007)  and 
Braciani  (2011).  We  also  performed  interviews  with  renewable  energy  specialists  from  Eletrobras 
CHESF, a big owned-state electricity company in Brazil8.  

Our  model  also  distinguishes  ten  different  types  of  workers,  classified  according  to  their  wage 
incomes,  as  a  proxy  for  skills.  The  income  earned  by  those  ten  different  workers types  is  assembled to 
compose  the  household  income  –  the  expenditure  unit  of  the  model.  Then,  our  model  distinguishes  ten 
different  household  types,  classified  by  their  income.  For  electricity  sectors,  we  use  supplementary 
information  from  Brazilian  Employment  Department  (RAIS/MTE)  to  improve  our  vector  of  workers 
skills distribution across each generation industry.  

For the  purpose of  this  research,  we  combined  the  Thermal  Oil  and  Diesel  electricity  in  only  one 
sector/product, because Brazil will not invest in those sources anymore as well as will not renew contracts

that  will  expiry  during  the  PDE  horizon  (EPE,  2017).  We  also  combined  the  Biomass  from  Sugar  and 
Ethanol  in  one  product,  called  “GerBagaco”,  and  we  aggregated  the  industries  Biomass  (Sugar)  with 
Sugar  and  Biomass  (Ethanol)  with  Ethanol.  Hence,  both  Sugar  and  Ethanol  industries  produce  the 
“GerBagaco”  electricity  and  their  own  product  (sugar  and  ethanol,  respectively).  This  is  the  only  case 
where our make matrix, after aggregation, is not diagonal. The others sectors and goods were aggregated 
as well, resulting in 39 industries and 40 commodities.  

The Brazilian 27 regions were aggregated to 11 regions considering both economic and electricity 
(new  investments)  relevance.  They  are:  RestNO  (North  region,  except  Pará  state),  Para  (Pará  state), 
MaranPiaui  (Marahão  and  Piaui  states),  CearaRGNorte  (Ceará  and  Rio  Grande  do  Norte  states), 
PEparaibAL  (Pernambuco,  Paraíba  and  Alagoas  states),  BahiaSE  (Bahia  and  Sergipe  states),  RestSE 
(Southeast  region,  except  São  Paulo  state),  SaoPaulo  (São  Paulo  state),  RestSUL  (Paraná  and  Santa 
Catarina  states),  RGSul  (Rio  Grande  do  Sul  state)  and  CentroOest  (Central  West  region).  After  all  this 
process, our final database contains  11 regions,  40 commodities (8 electricity types and 1  Transmission 
and Distribution – T&D) and 39 industries, being 7 specifically for electricity generation and 1 for T&D. 
Table A-02, in Appendix, list these sectors and commodities. 

 

3.1.1  The core model and electricity mechanism 

TERM-BR10 follows TERM’s equation system. As described by Horridge (2011), the producers 
choose  a  cost-minimizing  combination  of  intermediate  and  primary  factor  inputs,  subject  to  production 
functions  which  are  structured  by  a  series  of  Constant  Elasticity  of  Substitution  (CES)  “nesting” 
assumptions.  The  primary  factors  and  intermediate  inputs  are  each  demanded  in  proportion  to  industry 
output  (Leontief  assumption).  The  primary  factor  aggregate  is  a  CES  composite  of  capital,  land  and  a 
labour aggregate – which it is itself a CES composite of labour by skill group. The aggregate intermediate 
input  is  a  CES  composite  of  different  compound  commodities,  which  are  in  turn  CES  composites  of 
goods  from  different  sources:  imported  and/or  national,  which  could  be  from  one  or  a  mix  of  those  27 
regions (11 after aggregation). The exception  is  for Transmission and Distribution (T&D)  industry, that 
we assume a Leontief combination of electricity and other goods to compose the aggregate intermediate 
input (Figure 03). 

In  our  model,  the  T&D  industry  collects  the  electricity  produced  by  all  generation  activities 
locally  and  then  supply  it  to  households  and  others  industries.  The  excess  of  each  region  is  distributed 
along the national territory, via  inter-regional trade. With this approach, the electricity  supplied by  each 
region  is  a  mix  of  the  production  of  the  generation  types.  The  share  of  each  source  in  this  electricity 
composite  is  subject  to  changes  accordingly  to  relative  prices  under  a  CES  system.  It  means,  in  other 
words,  that  TERM-BR10  could  properly  substitute  one  type  of  electricity  by  another  in  response  to 
changes in production and prices regionally. By its turn, the consumption in each region, if it is not self-
sufficient in production, could be a composite of local and other regions’ electricity.

The model's recursive dynamics9 consists of three mechanisms: (i) a stock-flow relation between 
investment  and  capital  stock,  which  assumes  a  1-year  gestation  lag;  (ii)  a  positive  relation  between 
investment and the rate of profit; and (iii) a relation between wage growth and regional labor supply. The 
capital in each period grows by an amount equal to the rate of investment at the beginning of the period, 
less a deduction  for depreciation. Thus, a change  in  investment this period (t) affects the growth rate of 
capital  not  in  this  period  but  in  the  next  (t+1).  The  investment  allocation  in  its  turn  is  driven  by  two 
components:  a)  investment/capital  ratios  are  positively  related  to  expected  rates  of  return;  and  (b) 
expected rates of return converge to actual rates of return via a partial adjustment mechanism (Horridge, 
2002).

9 As described by Horridge (2002), a “annual recursive dynamics model” means that each solution of the model represents the 
changes  between  one  year  and  the  next.  The  'initial'  data  base  that  is  the  starting  point  of  each  computation  represents  the 
economy as it was both at the end of the previous period and at the beginning of the current period.

PDE 2026 provides an expansion plan for several scenarios, but it lacks details about the location of 
the projects, specifying only macro regions. Thus, we regionalized the investments to our 27 regions (11 
after aggregation). 

To find out the  location  for projects  already contracted we use the WEBMAP tool10. This system 
details  contracted  expansion  with  information  as  capacity  (MW),  state  (region)  and  the  start-year  of 
operation.  Using  this  data,  we  regionalized  the  expansion  already  contracted  year  by  year.  For  planned 
projects, we used as guideline the technical report NT DEA 015/17, jointly published with PDE 2026 by 
EPE. This document is dedicated to the environmental analysis of the plan and contains information about 
the location of hydro dams and gas, nuclear and coal plants, as well as geographic considerations for the 
expansion  of  biomass,  wind  and  solar  sources.  Additionally,  we  also  considered  the  results  of  the  last 
auctions for wind, biomass and solar technologies. The Table A-02, in Appendix, shows the distribution 
criteria  we  applied  to  split  the  PDE  2026  regional  level  to  the  27  regions  of  TERM-BR10.  Then,  we 
aggregated the MW expansion matrix to the 11 regions considered for simulation. 

This  process  results  in  a  PDE  2026  expansion  matrix  (contracted  +  planned)  year  by  year, 
disaggregated by source, for each scenario in our regional level for the period 2017-2026. Adopting 2016 
installed  capacity  as  base  year,  we  are  able  to  compute  for  any  region  and/or  any  source  growth  rates 
(geometric, year by  year, etc).  For simulation purpose, we assumed a linear expansion, adding the same 
amount of MW every PDE year. 

To compute our policy shocks, we subject the capital stock of the model’s electricity  industries to 
its  correspondent  annual  variation  from  the  PDE  expansion11.  Then,  we  calculate  the  investment 
necessary  to  support  this  new  capital  stock  expansion,  driven  by  PDE  rates.  The  percent  variations  of 
investment  against  the  previous  year  are  our  shocks.  As  we  assumed  a  one  period  gestation  lag,  it  is 
straightforward  that  to  simulate  an  expansion  of  installed  capacity  for  the  period  2017-2026  the 
investment has to be placed in 2016-2025. Finally, in our case, for each one of our four scenarios we have 
a three-dimension matrix for shocks: electricity industries X regions X years. For this reason, these tables 
are not available in this paper, but are available upon request. 

 

3.3 Simulation strategy 

Our simulation  is an evaluation of the economic consequences of policy guidelines embodied by 
PDE 2026 scenarios. For that, we have to establish a baseline path, describing the “natural” expansion of 
the  economy  and  electricity  supply,  and  the  policy  or  “perturbed”  scenarios,  incorporating  the 
government  directions  for  the  electricity  matrix.  The  deviations  from  the  perturbed to the  baseline  path 
are interpreted as the effects of policy interventions.  

The  simulation  contains  three  parts:  i)  update  of  database  from  2010  to  2015,  using 
macroeconomic aggregates; ii) PDE investment period (2016-2025); and an extended period (2026-2035), 
in order to capture the spread out effects of the investments. The differences between baseline and policy 
scenarios are restricted to the shocks for the PDE period. 

As a long-run dynamic simulation, the economic system is mainly characterized by the evolution 
of primary factors and technological progress. The TERM-BR10 has three primary factors (labour, capital 
and land), for which we are assuming that: 

Labour  supply  is  driven  by  regional  work  force  projections.  Besides,  labour  could  flows 

i) 
between regions accordingly to relative real wages. 

                                                             
10 See https://gisepe.epe.gov.br/WebMapEPE/ 
11 We don’t have the Biomass industry in our model. The “GerBagaco” commodity is produced by Sugar and Ethanol sectors. 
From the PDE expansion for Biomass, we are assuming 75% for Sugar industry and 25% for Ethanol.

ii) 
Capital  is endogenous and  its evolutions  it is associated to  investment. The investment in 
each sector, by its turn, follows rates of return. The exception is electricity generation industries, 
where we are controlling the investment for simulation purposes. 

iii) 
Land is mainly used by agriculture and livestock, but mining, oil, gas and hydro generation 
sectors also use a slight amount of this resource. For the period 2016-2035, we are expanding the 
agricultural land in each region by a uniform rate equivalent to 1/4 of the increase rate observed in 
the last 5 years.  

For technological  progress  we  consider  an  annual  increase  of  2.0%  for  land  productivity  and  of 
0.5%  for  productivity  of  Transmission  and  Distribution  industry12.  On  the  demand  side,  we  adopt  a 
growth rate of 2.5% for exports (quantity) and the PDE’s rates for GDP during the period 2017-2026 and 
an average rate of 3.0% after that. 

In  electricity  industry,  we  assume  the  Case  8  (directed  expansion)  as  our  baseline.  This  is  the 
scenario with less policy interventions and hence, closer to a natural expansion of installed capacity. Our 
policy  alternatives  are  the  Case  1  (reference),  Case  4(solar)  and  Case  5(no  new  hydro  dams).  These 
scenarios have specific guidelines that affect the electricity mix (Figure 2). 

We consider that PDE investments are mainly support by foreign savings. This assumption in our 
closure  relies  on  the  fact  that  Brazil  is  under  fiscal  austerity  and  is  mostly  funding  its  infrastructure 
projects via concessions. In electricity, foreign investment have been leading this process, achieving more 
than 75% of total investment in the sector13. On the other hand, this assumption could affect the exchange 
rate during the investment period, but it should smoothly return to its equilibrium level after that. 

 

4.  RESULTS 

4.1 Macroeconomic aggregates and production 

Our  results  show that  all  policies  have  a  positive  deviation  from  the  baseline  in  macroeconomic 
aggregates.  This  gives  us  a  first  insight  that  government  guidelines  embodied  by  those  scenarios  are 
resulting in economic benefits. The exception is Exports. However, we could interpret this as an outcome 
of our long-run closure, where the investment is supported by foreign savings and, consequently, implies 
appreciation of the exchange rate (Table 2). The strict relations between Capital Stock and Investment as 
well as Household consumption and GDP were also verified.

The Reference  scenario,  the closest to our baseline, results  in a  slight  increase of  GDP (0.12%), 
due to more investments in solar and gas sources. The Case 4, intensive in solar source and which has the 
greater amount of investment estimated by PDE 2026, is responsible for the large impacts: 0.45% in GDP 
and  1.43%  in  aggregated  investment.  By  its  turn,  the  no  new  hydro  dam  scenario  (case  5)  also  has  a 
positive effect in economic terms, even with less investment  in monetary units, estimated by PDE 2026, 
than the baseline.  

                                                             
12 In Brazilian context, it represents a reduction in losses and differences (“Perdas e Diferenças”) of the national grid. 
13  According  to  data  from  Brazilian  Central  Bank,  in  2017,  foreign  investment  in  capital  in  electricity  corresponds  to 
approximately 75% of the total (BNDES disbursements + foreign investment in capital).  

10 

 

These specific results, which occur in both Case 1 and Case 8, evidence that there is no a straight 
link between the total amount of investment, estimated outside the model, and its impact on the economy 
in terms of GDP, aggregated investment and other variables. These impacts are also driven by the spread 
out effects of the electricity industry which receive the investment. In this case, the no-hydro scenario has 
more  investment  in  Coal  and  Solar  sources  than  the  baseline.  These  technologies,  by  its  turn,  have  an 
investment  vector  more  concentrated  in  equipment  and  machinery  while  the  hydro  dams  are  infra-
construction  intensive (Table  A-01,  in  Appendix). Our results, hence, reflect the net  impact of all those 
effects. 

The specifics about investment in electricity industries also affect the production of others sectors. 
In  the  Reference  scenario,  for  example,  the  Natural  Gas  industry  expanded  0,82%  (in  relation  to  the 
baseline), reflecting the Natural Gas plant that Case 1 has in addition to the Case 8.  This also happens to 
Case  5  (1.21%),  in  which  the  investment  in  thermal  electricity  from  gas  increases  to  substitute  the 
absence  of  new  hydro  dams.  In  Solar  scenario,  on  the  other  hand,  we  observe  the  Electronic  sector 
increasing by 1.15% in response to large  investments in photovoltaic generation, meanwhile the Natural 
Gas  industry  reduces  production  in  -1.45%.  Sectors  associated  with  other  generations  sources  as  Oil, 
Sugar and Machinery for Construction declined their production as well. 

The electricity industries, particularly, increase or reduce their production  in response to changes 
in  prices  and/or  the  expansion  of  their  capital  stock.  Our  results  show  that  Solar  generation  industry 
(“GerFotovolt”), for example,  increases  its production  in every  scenario, but followed by a reduction of 
wind electricity (Graph 01). This is consisting with PDE 2026 expansion plans, where an addition of solar 
is  followed  by  reduction  in  wind  electricity  due  to  peak  and  seasonality  reasons.  However,  as  the  net 
effect in GDP is positive, it suggests that, a priori and subject to the supply plan estimated by PDE 2026, 
to  support  a  specific  demand  using  photovoltaic  generation  has  a  greater  spread  out  effect  than  wind 
technology14.  Besides,  our  results  also  show  that  the  policy  of  restrict  new  hydro  dams  (Case  5)  is 
compensated  by  an  increase  in  electricity  generation  form  Coal  (“GerTermoCarv”),  as  planned  by  PDE 
2026.

Regionally, differences between the policy scenarios are clearly visible. In the case 5 (no-hydro), 
for example, those regions with large share of hydro generation in its electricity mix,  such as North and

South regions15, face a GDP  loss.  On the other hand, locations with geographic conditions to host  solar 
investments  had  an  increase  in  GDP  in  scenario  4.  This  is  the  case  of  Northeast  regions,  such  as 
PEparaibAL,  CearaRGNorte  and  MaranPiaui.  These  areas  also  have  positive  deviation  under  Reference 
scenario due to greater solar and gas investments than our baseline (Graph 2). As expected, the household 
consumption follows regional GDP, while the capital stock is linked to the investment. Regarding to the 
exports, all regions face negative deviation because of the same reasons as the national exports (Table A-
03).

The electricity  generation at regional  level also respond to  prices and capital stock. Hence,  wind 
and  hydro  electricity  has  negative  deviation  in  all  regions  and  in  all  scenarios,  as  a  consequence  of 
government  interventions.  On  the  other  hand,  solar  electricity  had  large  increase  in  almost  all  regions 
(Table A-04). Summarily, under PDE 2026 guidelines the Northeast region is the most benefitted in terms 
of electricity production, as expressed by the results of Transmission and Distribution industry. However, 
it  is  important  to  highlight  that  under  hydro  restriction  (Case  5)  the  Southeast  region  (“RestSE”  and 
“SaoPaulo”) have the largest deviation for T&D due to its increase in gas electricity supply (Table A-04). 

The impact among other sectors was also affected by regional characteristics. The agriculture and 
cattle  industry,  for  example,  had  large  expansion  in  Northeast  region,  where  it  represents,  in  relative 
terms, a significant part of GDP. São Paulo state, which has about 35% of national industry, had positive 
deviation  in  sectors  such  as  Construction,  Services  and  Manufacturing  due  its  local  activity  as  well  as 
demands from other regions.  

 

4.2 Employment and distributive effects 

Despite the economic growth, we do not observe for aggregated employment significant deviation 
between  scenarios  and  the  baseline,  once  they  are  subject  to  the  same  population  and  work  force 
expansion as well as a long-run closure. However, at regional level we observe, in general, an increase in 
the  employment  in  North  and  Northeast regions  combined  to  a reduction  other regions,  specially  South 
(“RestSul” and  “RGsul”) and Southeast (“RestSE” and  “SaoPaulo”). This  movement  is quite  noticeable 
in Case 4 (solar), in which the Northeast regions have a large GDP growth, and it is slightly different for 

                                                             
15  Pará  state  is  located  in  North  region  and  site  the  Belo  Monte  dam.  However,  this  project  is  already  contracted  and, 
consequently exists in all scenarios. Thus, this state is not too affected by the constraints of Case 5.

Our  results  also  show  that  regions  with  greater  variations  in  employment  also  had  the  largest 
increases  in  wages.  In  opposite  way,  regions  with  a  reduction  in  jobs  are  those  with  small  increase  or 
negative  variations  in  salaries  (Table  A-05).  This  clearly  shows  that  regional  employment  follows  the 
relative  wage  and  that  the  net  effect  is  a  movement  of  employment  from  regions  with  large  share  of 
national  GDP,  such  as  “SaoPaulo”,  to  those  with  small  share,  such  as  the  Northeast  regions 
“MaranPiaui”, “CearaRGNorte” and “PEparaibAL”.  

We are also able to see that the increase in wages was relatively bigger in low skilled jobs than in 
other classes (Table A-06). This supports our regional results, once Northeast regions have large share of 
their labour force composed by low skilled workers. However, it is important to highlight that high skilled 
jobs  also  had  a  positive  effect  in  both  quantity  and  wages  due  to  economy  activity  in  specialized 
industries associated to  electricity generation, such as  manufacturing and electronics. This effect, by the 
way, is more intensive in Case 4. 

Supported  by  regional  macroeconomic  and  employment  results,  the  impact  to  household 
consumption  was  relatively  bigger  in  those  families  with  low  income  (Graph  4).  Unmistakable,  this 
shows that  policy  interventions  in the energy planning have welfare  implications as well as that  sources 
considered in the energy mix substantially matters to these impacts.  

                                                             
16 At a first view, these deviations could be interpreted as small, but they are relevant in terms of jobs. For example, in 2035 
the  work  force  at  “CearaRGNorte”  is  estimated  in  9.34  million  workers.  If  we  consider  Case  4,  the  deviation  of  0.07% 
represents  about  6,580  employers,  i.e.  additional  jobs  derivate  from  investments  that  this  scenario  has  in  addition  to  the 
baseline. For “PEparaibAL” region, this number is 9,941 jobs.

5.  FINAL REMARKS 

 

The  scenarios  provided  by  The  Brazilian  Decennial  Energy  Plan  (PDE  2026)  shows  that  Brazil 
has a privileged position regarding its electricity supply: the country could face different geographic and 
market  restrictions  and  still  provide  a  diverse  and  renewable  mix    compatible  with  climate  agreements 
and economic growth. 

Our  work  shows  that  this  flexibility  in  electricity  supply  also  entails  important  economic  and 
regional  issues.  A  supply  plan  with  more  insertion  of  solar  source,  for  example,  could  increase  the 
national  GDP  by  0.45%  and  by  2.15%  in  specific  regions.  As  well,  we  show  that  a  no  new  hydro  dam 
scenario does not imply economic losses, in terms of national GDP or employment. Both results are quite 
interesting, taking in account that cost for solar panels has been drastically reduced in the last years and 
the  hydrologic  and  environmental  restrictions  could  impose  important  limits  to  the  expansion  of  hydro 
dams. 

We also show that the economic impacts are greater in the poorest regions and to the low income 
households,  portraying  welfare  and  distributive  benefits  of  policy  guidelines.  This  result  offers  useful 
insights  for  policy  makers,  once  Brazil  still  faces  a  strong  regional  inequality  and  the  combination  of 
energy and regional policy could be effective. 

Finally, we highlight that our results are restricted to the economic analysis of the electricity plans. 
The  extension  of  the  analysis  to  incorporate  environmental  issues,  mainly  emissions,  is  of  obvious 
importance, and will be the next step in this research effort.
