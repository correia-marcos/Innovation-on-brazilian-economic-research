Abstract: In recent years, the debate on issues related to demographic changes and their impacts on 
the economy has increased. However, demographic changes affect not only variables such as 
economic growth and the labor market, but also aggregate consumption, and especially the 
composition of this consumption. These changes in population composition may occur in the 
coming decades in many parts of the globe, and their effects on the composition of consumption, 
notably on energy demand and emissions are not yet known. In this context, this article aims to 
estimate the changes in the pattern of consumption in Brazil due to the changes projected in the age 
pyramid in 2050 and the consequences of these changes on CO2 emissions. For this, projections will 
be made using a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model (CGE) considering 65 
sectors and 7 age groups for the Brazilian economy. The results suggest that the change in age 
structure seem to lead to an emissions less intensive consumption pattern, around 0.25% 
(accumulated deviation relative to baseline) in 2050.

Resumo: Nos últimos anos, aumentou o debate sobre questões relacionadas às mudanças 
demográficas e seus impactos na economia. No entanto, as mudanças demográficas afetam não 
apenas variáveis como o crescimento econômico e o mercado de trabalho, mas também o consumo 
agregado e, principalmente, a composição desse consumo. Essas mudanças na composição 
populacional podem ocorrer nas próximas décadas em muitas partes do globo, e seus efeitos sobre a 
composição do consumo, notadamente sobre a demanda de energia e as emissões ainda não são 
conhecidos. Nesse contexto, este artigo tem como objetivo estimar as mudanças no padrão de 
consumo no Brasil em função das mudanças projetadas na pirâmide etária em 2050 e as 
consequências dessas mudanças nas emissões de CO2. Para isso, serão feitas projeções usando um 
modelo de equilíbrio geral computável dinâmico (CGE) considerando 65 setores e 7 grupos etários 
para a economia brasileira. Os resultados sugerem que a mudança na estrutura etária parece levar a 
um padrão de consumo menos intensivo de emissões, em torno de 0,25% (desvio acumulado em 
relação à linha de base) em 2050.

1.  Introduction 

 
In the last few decades, researchers around the world have shown growing concern in 

studying issues related to demographic changes and their impacts on the economy. According to 
Park and Hewings (2007), the focus is on the impact of population size on economic growth, whose 
debate was centered on whether economic growth is limited, promoted or independent of population 
growth. Among the pessimistic current, like Ehrlich (1968), it is believed that rapid economic 
growth is a threat to limited resources since much of the investment needs to be used to serve the 
growing population. On the other hand, the more optimistic (Kuznets, 1967; Simon, 1981) believe 
that a larger population facilitates economies of scale and promotes technological innovation. 

Another concern of this literature is the effect of population growth on the labor market and 

its consequences on social security systems, which may face difficulties if the ratio of pensioners 
per worker increases (Kronenberg, 2009; O'Neil et al. 2010; DeWhurst, 2006; Yoon and Hewings, 
2006). However, demographic change affects not only variables such as economic growth and the 
labor market, but also aggregate consumption and especially the composition of this consumption. 
In general, according to O'Neil et al. (2010), population treatment in the literature has been limited 
to the direct effects of changes in population size and, according to Park and Hewings (2007), pay 
little attention to how population structure can influence economic growth and consumption. 

On the other hand, studies by Park and Hewings (2007), Kronenberg (2009), Dalton et al. 

(2008) and Fougère et al. (2007) attempted to decompose population growth in terms of fertility and 
mortality components and more importantly, to examine the impacts of age distribution on 
economic growth. If individuals have different behaviors at various stages of life, changes in age 
structure in the economy can have an immediate effect. For example, a country with a high 
proportion of older people may experience lower economic growth because a large proportion of 
the resources will have to be allocated to serve a less productive population. 

In the same direction, Dalton et al. (2008) stated that other demographic factors may be 

important, such as the indirect effects of scale that may arise through changes in population 
composition due to aging, urbanization or other determinants of economic growth. However, with 
many economies experiencing demographic changes, it is necessary to consider the impacts of these 
changes on the structure of production and consumption. 

According to Kronenberg (2009), it is generally accepted by most economists that the 

current pattern of consumption is unsustainable, and the debate revolves around the instruments that 
can be used to change it. Often, they forget that in fact, patterns are already changing because of 
demographic changes. The process resulting from higher life expectancy rates coupled with lower 
fertility rates contributes to changes in consumption patterns. 

These changes in population composition may occur in the coming decades in many parts of 

the globe, and their effects on the composition of consumption, notably on energy demand and 
emissions are not yet known. The composition of the population can affect consumption patterns 
which vary in their indirect energy requirements because of the energy incorporated in the different 
consumer goods (Bin and Dowlatabadi, 2005). While such changes may affect energy use and 
hence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, analyzes of emissions scenarios have left these issues aside 
(Yoon and Hewings, 2006). 

Statistical analyzes of historical data suggest that population growth has contributed to 
emissions growth in recent years (Dietz and Rosa, 1997; Cole and Neumayer, 2004; Fan et al., 
2006) and that urbanization, aging, and changes in household size can also affect energy use and 
emissions. Nevertheless, according to O'Neil et al. (2010), an explicit analysis of the effects of this 
demographic change on emissions in the future has been limited. Although much of the studies 
includes assumptions about future population growth, only a few studies have explicitly 
investigated the separate effects of demographic changes on emissions (O'Neil et al., 2010). 
Families can affect emissions directly through consumption or indirectly through the effects on the 
sectors of the economy via the production chain. 

As observed by Dewhurst (2006), the consumption pattern of the younger and older is 

different. Thus, a general result of studies on patterns of consumption is the observation that people 
of different age groups have different consumption patterns. Retirees do not exhibit the same 
pattern of consumption as those currently employed and parents with younger children have 
different demands from those who have older children. Any aging population will shift demand 
patterns from younger people to older people, increasing demand for some goods and services, and 
decreasing demand for others. This change in consumption pattern and the consequent multiplier 
effect across the economy will show opportunities for expansion for some sectors and contraction in 
others (Dewhurst, 2006). 

In the Brazilian case, Wong and Carvalho (2006) pointed out a differentiated growth 

predicted for the population of active age in the coming decades. Brazil is in an advanced stage of 
transition for both mortality and fertility, which makes it possible to predict that the population of 
the elderly over 65 will increase at an accelerated rate (2 to 4% per year), while the young 
population will decrease (Nasri, 2008). This transition began in the 1960s with the reduction of 
fertility that began in the most privileged population groups and in the more developed regions. In 
the future, the population will stabilize, but it will become older and with a low, perhaps even 
negative, growth rate. 

According to data from the IBGE (2010), the 5- to 9-year age group declined from 14 to 

12% between 1970 and 1990. In this period, the presence of children under 5 years of age was 
reduced from 15 to 11%. In the year 2000, each of these groups came to represent 9% of the total 
population. On the other hand, the age group of people over 65 years old increased from 3.5 in 1970 
to 5.5% in 2000. By 2050, this age group is expected to account for about 19% of the Brazilian 
population. These facts will lead to a change of pattern in the Brazilian population pyramid. Figure 
1 illustrates the change in the 2010 Brazilian age pyramid to the projection of 2050.

Figure 1 shows an increase in the participation of older people in the total population of 

Brazil. This projected demographic change affects final demand, which in turn generates 
repercussions on the production structure of the economy, that is, the participation of some sectors 
in total production. Kronenberg (2009) argues that there is reason to believe that changes in 
consumption induced by demographic changes will also affect energy use and GHG emissions. For 
example, older people generally consume more heat energy and less gasoline than young people 
because they tend to be more sensitive to cold and use the car less often. This and other changes are 
likely to affect GHG emissions in Brazil. 
 
Brazil due to the changes projected in the age pyramid in 2050 and the consequences of these 
changes on CO2 emissions. For this, projections will be made using a recursive dynamic 
computable general equilibrium model (CGE) considering 65 sectors and 7 age groups for the 

In this context, this article aims to estimate the changes in the pattern of consumption in 

Brazilian economy. As far as we know, this is an unprecedented study for Brazil, being the first to 
attempt to evaluate the impact of the population aging on consumption patterns and CO2 emissions. 
The dynamic CGE model can capture both the direct effects of this change, the indirect effects via 
inter-sectoral linkages and the substitution effects over time. Another advance of the research is to 
make the analysis more appropriate estimating different elasticities by age groups and sectors. 
 

2.  Evidence from literature 

 

Dietz and Rosa (1997) stated that the increasing GHG concentration threatens to produce 

significant changes in the global climate. There is a scientific consensus that increasing GHG 
concentrations are a consequence of human activity all over the globe. In this context, the authors 
developed a stochastic model called Impact (Population, Wealth, and Technology - IPAT) to 
estimate the effects of population, wealth and technology on CO2 emissions. Their results showed 
that population growth, in this case, not considering their age distribution, tends to aggravate GHG 
emissions. 

Cole and Neumayer (2004) used econometric panel data methods to estimate the 

relationship between two pollutants and demographic factors, as well as population size. For CO2 
emissions, the authors have found evidence that population growth causes a proportional increase in 
emissions, corroborating the findings by Dietz and Rosa (1997). 

Fougère et al. (2007) evaluated the sectoral impacts of ageing population in Canada arising 

from the combination of two structural changes and the labor market but did not assess GHG 
emissions from these changes. The first is the negative shock of labor supply due to lower labor 
force growth. The second is the change in the composition of consumption due to the increase in the 
proportion of older consumers. The analysis is made using an occupational and sectoral computable 
general equilibrium model with overlapping generations. The main result of the study is that 
although the negative supply shock is dominant, there are also some important sectoral shifts due to 
changes in final demand. For example, sectoral participation of health services in total GDP is 
expected to increase by approximately 50% from 4.8% of GDP in 2000 to 7% in 2050. 

Dewhurst (2006) assessed the effects of population ageing in Scotland without considering 

their impacts on GHG emissions. Considering that consumption patterns differ according to the 
average age of family members, he has disaggregated the household income column into three 
subsectors: (i) younger families (head of household under 65 years); ii) mature families (head of 
household between 65 and 74 years); and (iii) older families (head of 75 years or older). The study 
also used projections of changes in household composition to predict changes that can be expected 
in consumption. Keeping the income fixed, an increase of older families and a decrease of younger 
families would reduce the final demand for some commodities and increase for other commodities. 

Other studies have attempted to assess the effects of demographic changes, notably 
population ageing, on the economy and GHG emissions. According to Fan et al. (2006), all 
countries share the responsibility of limiting the rapid growth of GHG emissions to try to mitigate 
the effects of climate change around the world. To achieve this goal efficiently, researchers are 
concerned about the factors that impact on CO2 emissions and the extent of those impacts. 

There are two distinct perspectives on the impacts of population growth on the environment 

quality: the Malthusian tradition and the Boserupian approach. The first one states that 
environmental degradation happens because of the pressure that the population puts in the 
resources. In contrast, the Boserupian perspective (Boserup, 1981) states that population growth 
encourages the emergence of technological innovations which attenuate the negative impact on the 
environment. Consequently, Malthusians predict that the impact of the population on GHG 
emissions is more than proportional, while Boserupians claim that this relationship does not exist, 
or if does, has a negative elasticity (Fan et al., 2006). 

In this sense, Fan et al. (2006) investigated the impact of population, wealth and technology 

on CO2 emissions from countries with different income levels from 1975 to 2000, using the 
STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) 

econometric model. Their results showed that globally, economic growth has the greatest impact on 
CO2 emissions. The proportion of the population aged 15-64 has a negative impact on emissions in 
countries with higher income levels and a positive impact on emissions from countries with other 
income levels. 

Dalton et al. (2008) analyzed how the age composition of US households may, in the 

coming decades, affect energy use and CO2 emissions. For this, they incorporated the age structure 
of the population into a dynamic computable general equilibrium model with multiple 
heterogeneous families. The model is used to estimate and compare the effects of population ageing 
and technical changes on the trajectory of energy use and CO2 emissions. The results showed that 
the population aging can contribute to the reduction of emissions in the long term by almost 40% in 
a scenario of low population growth. The effects of population ageing on emissions may be greater 
than the effects of technical changes in some cases. 

Kronenberg (2009) estimated the impact of demographic change in Germany on energy use 

and GHG emissions. The author used microdata of household survey to identify age-specific 
consumption patterns and projected the impact of demographic change on the consumption 
structure by 2030 using an environmental input-output model. His results suggest that, by 2030, 
demographic change will increase the share of methane of total GHG emissions and will not 
contribute to reduce energy use and emissions in Germany. The author also evaluated two distinct 
policy scenarios: a redistribution of income from working-age families to older families, and a 
policy of replacing the use of private vehicles to public transportation. The first policy did not have 
a significant impact on emissions while the second policy helped to reduce both energy use and 
emissions. 
 

3.  Methodology  

3.1 Theoretical Structure of the CGE model  

 
The general equilibrium model used in this study was ORANIGBR-HOU. It is a model 

developed for the Brazilian economy that starts from the theoretical structure of the Australian 
model ORANI-G (Horridge, 2011) with a disaggregation of the household consumption vector by 
different age groups. The model was calibrated with 2010 data from the Brazilian national accounts 
and the input-output matrix. In addition, a recursive dynamics module was introduced that allows 
the implementation of simulations in which the stock of capital accumulates over time, just as the 
labor market presents a certain inertia in the adjustment of wages and employment. 

The model has 65 sectors and 65 commodities, five components of final demand 

(household consumption, government expenditure, investment, exports and inventories), two 
elements of primary factors (capital and labor) and two margins (trade and transportation). The 
model also has a disaggregation of the consumption vector into seven age groups (better 
explanation in section 2.4). 

ORANIGBR-HOU is composed of blocks of equations that determine demand and supply 
relationships according to optimization hypotheses and market equilibrium conditions. In addition, 
several national aggregates are defined in these blocks, such as aggregate employment, GDP, trade 
balance and price indices. Productive sectors minimize production costs subject to a technology of 
constant scale returns in which combinations of intermediate inputs and primary factor (aggregate) 
are determined by fixed coefficients (Leontief). There is substitution via prices between domestic 
and imported goods in the composition of the inputs via a constant substitution elasticity function 
(CES). There is also substitution between capital and labor in the composition of the primary factors 
through CES functions. 

In the model, households consume domestic and imported goods. The choice between 

domestic and imported is carried out by a CES specification (Armington hypothesis). The treatment 
of household demand is based on a combined CES/Klein-Rubin preference system. Thus, utility 
derived from consumption is maximized by this utility function. This specification represents the 

linear spending system (LES), in which the share of expenditure above the subsistence level for 
each good represents a constant proportion of the total subsistence expenditure of each family. 
Government expenditure is exogenous. The demand for exports is defined in the usual 

way, that is, as a decreasing function of the effective price of export goods given the export 
elasticity. In turn, the variation of inventories accompanies the production level of the sectors, and it 
is also possible to treat it as exogenous. 

The model operates with market equilibrium for all goods, both domestic and imported, as 

well as in the factor market (capital and labor). The purchase prices for each of the use groups 
(producers, investors, households, exporters and government) are the sum of basic values and sales 
taxes (direct and indirect) and margins (trade and transportation). Sales taxes are treated as ad 
valorem rates on the basic flows. The demands for margins (transport and trade) are proportional to 
the flows of goods to which the margins are connected. The production structure considers that each 
industry can produce several products (secondary production), using the inputs (domestic and 
imported) and the productive factors (capital and labor). 

The ORANIGBR-HOU model has a recursive dynamic specification, in which investment 

and capital stock follow mechanisms of accumulation and intersectoral displacement from pre-
established rules, associated with depreciation and return rates. Thus, one of the modifications to 
make ORANIGBR-HOU dynamic is to link annual investment flows to capital stock. The labor 
market also presents an element of intertemporal adjustment which involves variables such as real 
wages, current employment and trend employment. 

 
 

3.2 Disaggregation of consumption vector in age groups 

 

This paper uses Consumer Expenditure Survey data set for the years of 2008/2009 to 

estimate the association between household expenditure composition and the presence of children 
and elderly individuals in households. This survey is carried out by the Brazilian Institute of 
Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística). The main aim of this 
survey is to estimate household consumption expenditure in order to subsidize the build of the 
National Consumer Price Index (INPC).  

The 2008/2009 survey contains information about the population living in urban and rural 

areas in Brazil. Its sample is representative for the 27 federal units, nine metropolitan areas, as well 
as for the whole country. The sample size included 190, 159 individuals living in 55,970 
households. Data collection is conducted through six questionnaires, five of them are organized 
according to type of expenditure: 1) household and residents characteristics; 2) collective 
expenditure in durable household goods 3) collective expenditure in food and cleaning, 4) 
individual expenditure; 5) individual earnings and wages. The last questionnaire investigates living 
conditions perception (IBGE, 2004).  
 
households according to the presence of elderly residents and children. The classification of 
households is done taking into account the number of adults (residents aged from 15 to 59 years 
stratified into two age groups), elderly persons (residents aged over than 59 stratified into three age 
groups) and children (residents aged from 0 to 14 years stratified into three age groups) in the 
household. The disaggregation of elderly individuals and children by age is important to allow the 
use demographic projections.  

 In order to analyze aging effect on expenditure composition it is necessary to classify 

Seven types of households were defined: households with only two adults; households with 
two adults and one child (0-4 years old, 5-9 years old, 10-14 years old); households with two adults 
aged from 15 to 49 and one adult aged from 50 to 59; households with two adults aged from 15 to 
49 years and one elderly aged from 60 to 69 and finally two adults aged from 15 to 49 years and 
one elderly over 70´s. Households including only two adults (15-49) were considered as the 
reference category for the comparison of expenditure composition. In order to allow the 
identification of aging effect, households with elderly and children living together were excluded 

from the sample. The seven groups of households defined in our typology represents 20% of the 
total sample (48.470 households) surveyed by POF in 2008/2009, that is, 12,144 households. Table 
1 reports the distribution of households according to each group. The largest group corresponds to 
households with only two adults (4,335 observations).

The association between household age structure and consumption composition was 

estimated through econometric models on Santiago (2014) for each household group and each type 
of product. It was run allowing the estimation of household- type semi-elasticity. All consumption 
items present in Expenditure Consumption Survey were aggregated into 15 groups of products.  For 
groups of products which are considered as individual expenditure (15 products), initially it was 
calculated the average cost of each product, represented as:

Where: 𝑔𝑚𝑖 is the average spent on product 𝑖, 𝑔𝑡𝑖 corresponds to total spent on product 𝑖 

and 𝑝𝑜𝑝2010 represents the Brazilian population in the year 2010. 

Thus, the estimated cost with product 𝑖 can be represented by the equation:

In addition to data from input-output matrix, CGE models use estimates of elasticities and 

parameters, called behavioral parameters, in their calibration. Such values are usually extracted 
from the literature, which is justified by the scarcity of data for the estimation. One of the 
parameters related to the household structure is the elasticity of expenditure (EPS). In this work, 
econometric estimates were based on the model proposed by in Santiago (2014) to estimate these 
elasticities considering 15 product groups from the 2008/2009 POF microdata, by age groups. After 
this, the 15 aggregates were distributed in the 65 products of the model. 

 

3.4 CO2 Emissions 

One of the goals of this article is to estimate the emissions resulting from the aging process 

 
 
of the Brazilian population. To meet this objective a vector of CO2 emissions intensity was 
calculated. Then we are going to calculate what will be the change of the emissions in the 
production and consumption structure of the Brazilian economy caused by the change in the age 
pyramid. For this, we used data from Energy Balance for Brazil in 2010 (EPE, 2011). The first step

ORANIGBR-HOU model. The method to disaggregate the sectors is the one proposed by Montoya 
et al. (2014). Basically, the idea behind this method is to create a set of subsectors considering the 
65 of the EGC model for each of the large sectors in BEN. Thus, it is considered that the energy 
consumption of the subsectors in toe (tonne oil equivalent) is proportionally related to their 
monetary flows contained in the IO (Montoya et al., 2014). 

The second step of this stage was to convert the energy coefficients (in 1,000 toe) into CO2 

emissions (Gg) due to the use of fuels by the various sectors of the economy. For this, the 
conversion coefficients found in Economy & Energy (2002) were applied. Finally, to calculate the 
intensity vector, the total emissions of each of the 65 sectors were divided by their respective values 
of production. This vector will be used at the end of the simulations with the ORANIGBR-HOU 
model to design the changes in the emissions that can be caused by the change in the age pyramid 
that would be in the Brazilian economy. The hypothesis is that no technological innovation occurs, 
that is, the emissions vector does not change in 2050 and emissions are linear to production. 
 

4.  Simulations 

 
In this section, we present the simulation strategies used to estimate the economic effects 
of changes in the pattern of consumption in Brazil due to the changes projected in the age pyramid 
in 2050 and the consequences of these changes on CO2 emissions. 

Firstly, a baseline scenario for the Brazilian economy is built from 2010 to 2050. It is a 

trend scenario for the Brazilian economy in which deviations from it can be measured, estimating 
the effects of specific policies. The baseline represents a growth trajectory of the Brazilian economy 
between 2011 and 2050 in which no demographic change occurs.  

Before the simulation of the baseline scenario, we need to define the model closure3. It is 

assumed that household consumption follows national income and that government expenditure 
follows household income. In addition, the share of the nominal trade balance over nominal GDP is 
exogenous. We also have the population growth and the imported price index as exogenous 
variables. The model works with relative prices and the price variable chosen as numeraire was the 
Consumer Price Index.  

After determining the closure, the baseline was divided into two periods. In the first period, 

from 2011 to 2015, the main macroeconomic aggregates, real GDP, investment, household 
consumption, government expenditure and export volume are considered exogenous. The objective 
is to update the main macroeconomic variables according to observed data in the period. Table 2 
shows those indicators:

2 It includes the residential sector.  
3 The closure of the model is the determination of the endogenous and exogenous variables of the simulations performed. 
Then  represents  the  assumptions  about  the  functioning  of  the  economy  and  its  adjustments  and  shocks  (policies). 
ORANIGBR-HOU is a dynamic model and allows the accumulation of capital over time and adjustments in the labor 
market.

In the second period of the baseline scenario, from 2016 to 2050, only real GDP is kept 
exogenous. This part of the baseline presents a path of economic growth of 2.5% per year for the 
period from 2016 to 2050 and represents the projection that is compared to the policy scenario 
(population ageing). 

The second step was to perform the policy simulation. To do this, in the policy scenario, 
we considered all main macroeconomic indicators as endogenous variables. The scenario aims to 
evaluate the impact on the Brazilian economy of the change in the age pyramid according to IBGE 
projections. Table 3 presents the scenario projected for the seven age groups considered in the 
ORANIGBR-HOU model.

5.  Analysis of the results 

 

5.1 Sectoral results 

 

The policy results presented here are reported as the cumulative percentage deviation (2020 

 
 
to 2050) relative to the baseline scenario. Table 4 presents the projected results of activity level 
when the change of the age pyramid occurs. As the consumption pattern changes the sectors output 
of the economy will change indirectly via production chain. As we can see, the most benefited 
sectors are Other Food Industry, Domestic Services, Personal Services, Associative Organizations, 
Meat, Real State Activities and Livestock.  

The most negative impact occurred in sectors as Financial Intermediate and Insurance, 

It is worth to note that with the ageing of population, the sector Electricity (1.68%) is 

Private Education, Biodiesel, Clothing, Furniture and Other, Food and Textile. 
 
growing around two times as the Oil Refining (0.83%)   
Regarding the results of sectoral emissions, Table 5 shows that the change of the Brazilian pyramid 
would cause an increase of 7,101.82 Gg of CO2, which would represent an additional of a little 
more than 1% in relation to the baseline scenario. Although many sectors traditionally emitting CO2 
have shown an increase in their levels of activity, it is observed that they have shown a reduction in 
the share of total emissions. This is the case of the Cellulose and paper, Oil refining, and 
Metallurgy. Although the share of total emissions has not changed much, as they are very polluting 
sectors, the small reduction of their activity in the total Brazilian economy contributes to a small 
increase in emissions. On the other hand, sectors that are not very emitting and which are highly 
important in the Brazilian economy, such as Trade and Construction, increased relative 
participation, which possibly contributed to the low increase of emissions in the Brazilian economy.

It is noted that the change in the composition of age groups makes the agricultural, food and 

beverage sectors as the activities that households most increase consumption. Financial intermediation 
and insurance services, as well as the sectors related to vehicles and transportation equipment, are the 
ones that reduce the most in household consumption. Note that households reduce Oil Refining 
consumption and increase electricity consumption. An expected result as older household tend to 
consume more electricity and less fuel. 

Regarding the emission results, Table 7 shows a reduction in CO2 emissions in the consumption 
vector of about 0.25%. That is, the change in the pattern of consumption due to the aging process of the 
Brazilian population leads to a reduction of emissions. From the results, it can be observed that the 
reduction of consumption in the Oil Refining sector is the one that most contributes to this result, since 
there is a decrease in the share of this sector in the total emissions.

4. Final considerations 
  

In recent years, the debate on issues related to demographic change and its impacts on the 

economy has increased. The literature has mainly emphasized the effect of population growth on the labor 
market and its possible consequences on social security systems. However, demographic change has no 
effect only on variables such as economic growth, labor market and social security, but also on aggregate 
consumption, and especially on the distribution of this consumption. The process of population aging thus 
contributes to changes in consumption patterns. And consequently, the change in consumption pattern 
also causes effects on energy use and GHG emissions. 

In this context, this article sought to estimate and analyze the changes in consumption pattern for 
Brazil due to the projected changes in the age pyramid from 2010 to 2050 and the possible consequences 
of these changes on CO2 emissions. For this, projections were made using a dynamic computable general 
equilibrium model for the Brazilian economy considering 65 productive sectors and 7 age groups. 

The results indicate that demographic change has a significant impact on the structure of 

household consumption expenditure considering different age groups. The most important impacts are 
observed in the areas of health and education. Household energy use is also significantly affected. In 
addition, the change in age structure seems to lead to a less emission-intensive consumption pattern. This 
result is mainly due to the decrease in participation in the consumption vector for 2050 of sectors such as 
Oil Refining. It is observed, therefore, that the aging population and the changes in the habits of 
consumption generate a reduction of the CO2 emissions in 0.25%.
