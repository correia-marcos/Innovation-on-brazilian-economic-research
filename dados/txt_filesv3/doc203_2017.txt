Abstract: The Low-carbon Agriculture Plan in Brazil (ABC Plan) tries to conciliate sustainable
growth of agricultural production and minimize the environmental impacts promoted by land-use
changes. The agriculture, orest and other land uses (AFOLU) sector is the main source of GHG
emissions in Brazil reaching in 2015 67% (1,310 Mt CO2eq) of total emissions. The implementation
of pasture recovery and integrated systems technologies are therefore seen as a promising strategy
for sustainable agricultural intensication in Brazil, since they can increase the organic matter in
the soil, sequester carbon, as well as increase the production per hectare. This article analysis the
relationship between these technologies and the land-sparing concept. Considering only the economic
aspects of ABC Plan, the outcomes suggest that the interaction of both technologies promotes the
land-spare eect in a aggregated way. There is a increase of natural and forest areas, specially
those inside the rural establishments. However, the regional results show a dierent dynamic in the
agricultural frontier. These regions intensify the pasture use to the detriment of native vegetation
and forests areas.
Keywords: land-use change, land-sparing, CGE modeling.

Introduction

Brazil is considered one of the major players in World agriculture. The Brazilian Agribusiness
sector has grown in real terms around 2.1% per year between 1994-2015 and is responsible for 21.5%
of Brazil's GDP (CEPEA, 2016). The Agribusiness GDP was US$ 374 billion in 2015. The agro-
processing industry accounts for 27% of it, the input and supply industry contributes with 12%
inputs, service sectors 31%, and primary agriculture and livestock production with 30%. For the
same year, the Agribusiness exports were US$ 88.2 billion and its trade balance was four times
greater than Brazilian trade balance.

The crop and vegetables production grew from 76.6 Mt to 209 Mt between 1998-2016. In the
same period the planted area grew from 35 Mha to 58.4 Mha. The production growth rate has been
2.6 greater than the area expansion, representing a strong productivity gain. The increase in yields
was responsible for 94% of the growth in the period 1975-2011 (GASQUES et al., 2013).
In the
period from 1990 to 2014 the livestock production grew 460% in the poultry sector, 225% in the
case of pork, and 101% for beef. It was related to a productivity gain of 3.62% per year between
1975-1996, and 6.64% between 1996-2006 (MARTHA et al., 2012).

In 2010 the Brazilian Government released the Low Carbon Agriculture Plan (ABC Plan)
(MAPA, 2012) as part of the voluntary climate policy commitments set in the COP-15 in Copenhagen,
to be implemented until 2020. The ABC Plan aims to mitigate GHG emissions in agriculture,
improve eciency in the use natural resources and increase the resilience of productive systems and
rural communities, as well as enable the sector to adapt to climate change.

The actions present in the ABC plan seek to train technicians and rural producers, technology
transfer, environmental and land regularization, technical assistance and rural extension, research,
development and innovation, availability of inputs, seeds and forest seedings production, and subsi-
dized rural credit (ABC Program).

The ABC Plan targets strategic investments in sustainable technologies to recover 15 Mha of
degraded pasture, increase the use of production systems combining crop, livestock and/or forestry
production in the same area in 4 Mha, expand no-tillage use and foster other low carbon technologies.
Such technologies for emissions mitigation are derived from their own capacity to directly reduce GHG
emissions, i.e., as a consequence of the productive process itself, and not as intensifying technologies
which reduce the pressure on agricultural area expansion.

Recovered pastures reduce CO2 emissions by at least 60% in a production system and increase
the biomass production. The nutrient replacement in the pasture improves the quality of the animal
diet, reducing the time of slaughter and the emission of methane gas (CH4) by the enteric fermen-
tation (KURIHARA et al., 1999). Also reducing the pressure to convert new natural areas into
pasture. When compared to a degraded pasture recovered areas provide a higher carbon stock to
the system since with the accumulation of organic matter in the soil provides lower CO2 losses to
the atmosphere.

Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLs) are planned systems involving temporal and spatial
interactions on dierent scales with animal and crop exploitation within the same area, simultane-
ously or disjointedly and in rotation or succession. The adoption of integrated systems is benecial
by reducing pasture degradation. The benets of ICLs include improved nutrient cycling, increased
fertilizer eciency, increased soil fertility due to the accumulation of organic matter, and better soil
aggregation (De Moraes et al., 2014). Also, ICLs promote improvement in production processes,
such as the machinery and labor, economic stability of factors, as well as risk reduction.

The ABC Plan actions mentioned above are strictly correlated to the concepts of land-sparing
and agricultural intensication driven by technological changes. Land-sparing is based on the theory
that aggregate increases in agricultural yields over time can reduce the overall area of agriculture
lands from what would have been needed without the increase in yields. These increases could occur
through either the use of degraded, marginal, and abandoned lands or through increases in yields on

2

lands currently in cultivation (COHN et al., 2014).

Intensication is dene by an increase in the productivity of land measured by the real value
of agricultural output per hectare (HAYAMI et al., 1971). In this sense, one of the major pathways
to intensication is technological process. Technology-driven intensication occurs when technical
change in a crop allows more output per unit of land for the same level of inputs. This is a result of
R&D, such as new seeds, better crop, and resource management practices (BYERLEE et al., 2014).
The objective of this paper is assess the impacts of the ABC Plan's actions on land-use and land-
use changes. What will be the new pattern of land use and competition and regional production given
the large volume of degraded areas that will be recovered? We evaluate an agro-environmental policy
that has not yet been quantitatively assessed in Brazil. Specically, it also innovates by proposing the
construction of a new Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. It represents the agricultural
markets and segments of the main Brazilian agro-industrial chains, taking into account regional
dierences, competition for land use by dierent crops and activities, environmental aspects related
to greenhouse gas emissions, and the evolution dynamics of the Brazilian economy, inserted in the
global context.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the BREA model with land
use representation, as well as the backstop technologies such as pasture recovery and ICLs. Section
3 concerns the main outcomes of the policy simulation, and some nal remarks are given in section
4.

2 The BREA model

The Brazilian Economic Analysis (BREA) is a static computable general equilibrium model.
BREA is a multi-regional and multi-sector model which represents the Brazilian economy by six
regions: South, Southeast, Center-West, Northeast, Northeast Cerrado (Savanna), and North Ama-
zon. Figure 1 shows the model representation. Each region's nal demand structure is composed of

public and private  consumption and investment  expenditure across goods. The model is based
on optimizing behavior and the agents produce, consume and sell services and products. Consumers
with their budget constraints and preferences demand goods maximizing their utility function. Pref-
erences are hypothetically continuous and convex, and their resulting continuous demand functions
are zero degree homogeneous with regard to prices, i.e., only relative prices can be determined.

On the production side, technology is described by a production function with constant returns
to scale combining intermediate inputs, and primary factors (capital, labor, and land). In equilibrium

3

the prot of rms is zero. Firms are assumed to have a specic production technology and demand
factors to minimize their costs. The model enables analysis of direct and indirect eects arising from
changes in public policies such as tari shocks, tax rates, and endowments.

The model is based on GTAPinGAMS nomenclature and is written in MSPGE language, de-
signed and solved as a nonlinear mixed complementarity problem in GAMS programming language
(RUTHERFORD; PALTSEV, 2000; RUTHERFORD, 2005). Figure 2 shows the economic structure
underlying the BREA model. The symbols in this ow chart correspond to variables in the economic
model. Yir portrays the production of good i in region r, Cr, Ir, and Gr portray private consumption,
investment, and public demand, respectively. XRir and M Rir represent the regional trade of good
i in region r, and Mir the import of good i into region r. RAr and GOV Tr are the representative
household and government consumers, and F Tr the activity through which the 'sluggish' factor of
production is allocated to individual sectors. Commodity and market ows appear in solid lines and
the doted lines represent the tax ows. To complete the economic structure, dif mr is the sum of

2.1 Database

The model runs with several database and these are divided in two dierent modules: economic
and land use. The economic module uses the 2009 input-output table for Brazil made available by
IBGE, and disaggregated among all Brazilian municipalities by NEREUS-USP 1. The nal data is
aggregated into 36 sectors and three factors of production: capital, labor, and land as shown in
Table 1. Several dierent data sets were revised and combined to build BREA, as those produced
by IBGE, INPE (Brazilian National Institute for Space Research), MMA (Federal Ministry for the
Environment), MAPA (Federal Ministry for the Agriculture), CONAB (Brazilian Supply Company),
and SOS Mata Atl√¢ntica.

2.2 Technology representation

The production technologies are represented by nested CES functions. The nested structure
allows greater exibility for inputs substitution, which is convenient when there is a higher level of
sector disaggregation, but it requires the availability of elasticities of substitution related to each nest.
The common nest structure for the agricultural sectors (rice, corn, cane, soy, frit, ocul), livestock
sectors (cttl, ola), and forestry (frst) is presented in Figure 3. The structure shows how various
inputs are aggregated in a nested fashion to represent the technology production. Components in
dashed line denote separate functions. The fossil-based energy consumption is combined through a
Leontief function, this fossil energy bundle is combined with the electricity consumption using a CES
function, which generates an Aggregate energy nest. The other intermediate inputs are combined by
a Leontief function (elasticity œÉne equals to zero), and this nest is combined with the aggregate energy
one resulting the Energy-materials nest. The primary factors of production, capital and labor, are
combined in the top nest under elasticity œÉva, and combining with the Resource-intense nest resulting
the sector output level. Note that the output is divided through a Constant Elasticity Transformation
(CET) function in domestic demand and export demand under elasticity of transformation œÉt.

The elasticity œÉf x governs the substitution between Energy-materials and land and œÉs governs
the substitution between the Energy-materials-land input bundle and the Capital-Labor bundle.
These elasticities are set as 0.3 and 0.7, respectively (CHEN et al., 2017).
It means that higher
prices for land can be overcome by substituting in the lower nest toward energy, fertilizer, and other
materials, and in the upper nest toward capital. The actual simulated output of agricultural product
per hectare of land in a scenario in each agricultural sector in BREA is a combination of endogenous
intensication possibilities that depend on relative prices of inputs.

Technological change may enter in BREA model through three dierent ways. First, exogenous
productivity growth in production factors following future trends expected in the scientic litera-
ture; second, dierent techniques or technology to mix inputs through substitution in the production
function in each sector and induced by changes in relative prices; and third, new technology represen-
tation whose the inputs requirements and production function are specied in the model database.
All three forms of technological change are pertinent in the land use modeling as described below.

In the rst option, land is subject to an exogenous productivity improvement for each land type
and agricultural sector. However, for a static version of the model is not trivial to justify productivity

gains in primary factors, the costs, and the benets associated to it. Besides, it is possible to intensify
conventional agricultural production in BREA as land can be partially substituted by inputs and
other primary factors as relative prices changes.

The production intensication is controlled primarily by two substitution elasticities in the
land-use sectors as aforementioned. The representation of new technologies is also a key feature of
CGE models dealing with natural resources and environmental goods and services. In the case of
land-use modeling and new agricultural technologies, such as presented in the ABC plan, the BREA
model is the rst one to explicitly represent these technologies, as well as its adoption.

Private consumption consistent with utility maximization is portrayed by minimization of the
expenditure to reach a given level of aggregate consumption. Final demand in the core model is
characterized by a Cobb-Douglas tradeo across composite goods which include both domestic and
imported inputs. Figure 4 displays the nested function for consumption. The lower level of the nested
structure has three dierent bundle of goods. The rst bundle is the energy bundle, a combination
of all types of energy such as electricity, oil, gas, coal, and rened oil; the second is a combination
of food and agricultural goods, and nally the third bundle is a combination of all other goods. The
top level shows the household consumption of transportation. The transportation nest captures the
total value spent in transportation services not including fuels.

2.3 Land Supply

Land use is one of the key elements for equilibrium conditions in CGE models, due to land
being a factor in the production of agricultural sectors. There is an increasing debate about the
land supply and its capacity to feed the global population, produce bioenergy crops and mitigate
GHG emissions. Several models have been developed to address these issues (GTAP-BIO, EPPA,
MIRAGE-bioF, IMAGE, LEITAP, and TERM-BR) (GOLUB et al., 2012; GOLUB; HERTEL, 2012;

GURGEL et al., 2007; LABORDE; VALIN, 2012; STEHFEST et al., 2013; Ferreira Filho; MORAES,
2015; SILVA et al., 2017).

Figure 5 shows the nested CET structure for land supply. In this function the rent-maximizing
land owner rst decides on the allocation of land among natural uses. The land owner decides the
allocation of land in natural areas and natural forest (public). Here, the CET structure captures the
pressure for deforestation over native vegetation. The land owner then decides on the allocation of
land between natural forest (private) and managed forest. Finally, the land owner decides on the
allocation of land among pasture, planted forest, and cropland.

Source: research data.

Figure 5: Land supply.

The CET parameter governs the ease of land mobility across uses within each region. The
parameter in cropland, planted forest, and pasture determines the ease with which land is transformed
across three economic uses, e.g., from planted forest to cropland. In the same way, the CET parameter
in the cropland nest determines the ease of transformation of land from one cropping activity to
another, e.g., from soybean to corn.

To keep consistency in land-use changes measured in physical hectares, the BREA model in-
corporates an adjustment in the land supply. This is done by incorporating an additional constraint
into the model that requires physical hectares employed in cropping, pasture, and forestry to add
up to total physical area. The model applies an adjustment to the CET aggregator such that it

7

could maintain the equivalence of input and output ows in terms of both value and physical units,
respectively (CHEN et al., 2013).

Once we have priced natural forest and natural areas, these are incorporated in the model as
part of the initial endowments of households in each region. The areas may be converted to other
uses or conserved in their natural state. The reservation value of natural lands enter each regional
representative agent welfare function with an elasticity of substitution with other consumption goods
and services (CHEN et al., 2017; GURGEL et al., 2017).

2.4 Backstop technologies

The central idea of the backstop technology is an approach for representing adoption in a CGE
framework (MORRIS et al., 2014). We seek a simple formulation that can be parameterized based on
observations, while capturing elements of rent and real cost increases if demand suddenly increases
due to a policy shock. The process is consistent with a general equilibrium framework and applied
to the Brazilian Economic Analysis model.

To produce the same outputs as those from current technologies (e.g. pasture land) backstop
technologies are usually more expensive to operate in the base year. Because of this, most backstop
technologies have not run at commercial scales, have been adopted only marginally by some produc-
ers, or have not operated at all so far, but they may become economic in the future pending changes
such as economic incentives or policy interventions.

Some backstop technologies have been run at nontrivial scales since 2012 (mostly due to incen-
tives or support provided by the government), including consortium production and crop-livestock
systems. BREA model represents the technology for pasture recovery considering dierent regional
costs regardless the degradation level of pasture. Moreover, the model explicitly represents two types
of integrated production: crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forestry. To the former the output is a
combination of grain (maize or soybean) and cattle, while the latter is a combination of grain (maize
or soybean), cattle, and forestry.

The calibration process is based on technical and engineering observed data about the costs and
the output levels of these technologies (ANUALPEC, 2010; SENAR, 2013). The backstop technology
for pasture recovery combines the capital-labor bundle, intermediate inputs - mainly chemicals and
fertilizers - and degraded pasture land to produce pasture as output (Figure 6). This representation
permits to aggregate value in land since the farmer could apply new agricultural techniques trough
combination of chemicals and fertilizers as well as machinery to improve the pasture productivity.
Consequently, the farmer has a better pasture land with higher productivity and value added.

Table 2 and Figure 6 show how the backstop technologies are connected to the technology
representation in the model. The value of land portrays the ratio between the rents of degraded
pastures and good pastures. In this fashion way the conversion occurs by one hectare of land each
time keeping the equivalence of input and output ows in terms of both value and physical units,
respectively.

Furthermore, the markups shown in Table 2 portray the regional dierence between the cal-
ibrated costs for pasture recovery and the observed loans data that the farmers took in the ABC
program. For example, for South region as a whole the total farmers' loans reach 32.3 times greater
than the total cost to recovery the observed area. The model considers only the cost with chemicals
and machinery to recover the pasture, however according to the ABC program the farmers could use
the loan to build, for example, a fence on the property or on the recovered area, as well as other types
of investments. As a result the markup values should be higher to capture these regional dierences.
The integrated systems use only pasture as land primary factor. The combination with in-
termediate inputs, capital, and labor produces dierent levels of output such as grain, beef, and
forestry.

Equally important, the ICLs do not have markups to reect the costs of its economic penetra-

tion. Assuring the ICLs can only use pasture land all the costs of pasture recovery are captured in
the function shown in Figure 6. With this approach the functions representing the ICLs give the
total direct investment to implement these systems.

2.5 Strategic scenarios

We assess the economic impacts ABC Plan's actions, such as pasture recovery (15 Mha) and
increase the integrated systems (4 Mha). The range of scenarios is chosen to represent quite dierent
approaches to policy implementation. The assessment of the likely results from the Priority scenario
are evaluated against the Non-Priority scenario. The Combined scenario assess the costs when the
assumption over priority areas for pasture recovery is relaxed.

Non-priority: We simulate the Brazilian voluntary commitment recovering 15 Mha of degraded
pasture and increasing the integrated systems in 4 Mha by 2020. The model applies freely such
technologies in dierent Brazilian regions.

Priority: In the second policy simulation, we add a constraint in the new technology adoption.
Such technologies are strictly used in priority regions dened by the degraded level of pasture present
in the model benchmark and shown in Table 3. The technology for integrated systems is calibrated
based on the observed data rather than freely as in the previous scenario. Simulating this combination
oers insights into comparing the policy design in terms of costs and eectiveness.

Combined: In the third scenario, we relax the constraint over priority areas. Their combination
oers insights about how much could be spend in pasture recovery when the constraint is relaxed.
It also oers the possibility to explore synergies between two dierent policy instruments.

In practice the shock enters into the model via subsidy of the regional governments for the
backstop technologies. It is possible to capture the penetration costs of each action as they become
available to farmers. These technologies are calibrated based on observed data, technical reports,
and agricultural engineering data to represent all the ABC costs as well as the penetration of the
new agricultural practices in the economic system.

3 Results

We start dening the main land-uses in BREA model. A better representation of land in a CGE
framework allows investigation of its use as an input to economic activities, as well as environmental
consequences of using land since the natural areas - forest and non-forest - are represented in the
database. The land-use and land-use changes are driven not only by increasing the demand for food,
fuel and ber, and the maintenance of natural environmental, but also by the agricultural aptitude
of these areas, as well as the willingness to convert them (GURGEL et al., 2017).

Cropland - areas planted with one of the six crops2 categories in the model: rice, maize, sugar
cane, soybean, fruits, and other cultures. Total area for cropland is around 65 Mha. Southern,
Southeastern, and Center-Western regions concentrate around 74% of total area, while the Northern
and Northeastern Cerrado region  the new agricultural frontier  represents around 21%.

Pasture - areas with natural grass or planted pasture used for livestock ranching and other live
animals. The regions North and Northeast Cerrado represent 43% of pasture in the model and as
aforementioned are the new agricultural frontier in Brazil. The total pasture estimated is 168 Mha
and 48 Mha of that is considered degraded pasture.

Degraded Pasture - areas with natural grass or planted pasture used for livestock ranching and
other live animals with low productive capacity. The occupation rate (or) is the ratio of total heads
and total pasture. The occupation rate determines the degradation level of pasture as well as the
division among dierent degradation levels. Pasture areas supporting levels of 0.75 animal units or
less per hectare are considered degraded areas. Table 3 shows the data of degraded pasture in the
model representation.

Considering pasture recovery the regional technology costs are driven by the land rentals. The
ratio between the rentals of degraded pastures and good pastures represents how much economic eort

are not considered. We avoid the overestimation of planted area using only the data for the rst crop in these cultures.

must be applied to recovery these areas. For instance, ratios of 0.70 and 0.44 for Center-West and
North regions, respectively, show lower investment to recovery the same quantity of area in Center-
West when compare to North (as shown in Table 2). Integrated systems such as crop-livestock and
crop-livestock-forestry only demand good pasture land as sector-specic primary factor, i.e., these
systems compete for land with cattle (cttl) and other live animals (ola) sectors. In this case, the
farmers are willing to apply these technologies only in high productivity or recovered areas, given
the investment volume and the protability time, specially the case of integrated system with forest
component. Consequently, the ICLs are not considered a recovery strategy in this research, even
though these systems have shown recovery and mitigation potentials (De Moraes et al., 2014).

The aggregated value of land-use change is presented in Figure 7 under dierent scenarios.
Duo to the policy implementation the outcomes of degraded pasture recovered under all scenarios
are the same (15 Mha). First, the outcomes show an increase in pasture land around 10 Mha
under Non-priority and Priority scenarios, and a slightly smaller area (9.6 Mha) under Combined
scenario. Despite the type of land recovered these values are a result of the competition for land by
dierent uses, i.e., not necessarily all 15 Mha would be converted in pasture land. As the supply of
land increases and also its productivity less land is used for traditional activities and more land is
available for other uses.

Figure 7: Aggregated land-use change under dierent scenarios.

Second, the technologies associated to the ABC Plan reduce the pressure over natural areas and
natural forests. Outcomes for all scenarios show an increase around 4.8 Mha in natural and forest
areas (public and private), which approximately 38% occurs in forest areas, specially those areas
inside the private establishments. For managed and planted forest areas the outcomes show a small
increase by 0.556 Mha and 0.554 Mha under Non-priority and Combined scenarios, respectively,
and 0.408 Mha under Priority scenario. At a national level there is a synergy between the recovery
pasture and forest actions such as control of deforestation, and planted forest, even though the model
does not explicitly represent the forest sector's actions. As the recovered areas of pasture increase
there is more suitable land for planted and managed forest activities, as well as less pressure to clear
new natural land.

Third, there is a decrease in cropland use indicating a intensication process across commodities
production despite the regional outcomes. Under Priority scenario the value of cropland use decreases
1.4 Mha. This result suggest a synergy between the two ABC Plan's actions analyzed in this research.
As the productivity of the recovered areas increases, such areas are destined to the production of

11

more protable crops, such as soybean and maize. Indeed, there are two factors that governs the
intensication of production. On the one hand, the livestock sectors demand less land per output and,
by other side, soybean and maize are produced in an integrated system with livestock and/or forest.
Also there are indirect environmental externalities, such as control of deforestation, biodiversity
conservation, ecosystem services, since the natural and forest areas are preserved. It is a strategy
win-win-win for land-sparing. The agricultural intensication and environmental preservation to
achieve a sustainable production of beef and grains are dependent of ICLs' implementation and
diusion.

Figure 8 shows the areas of integrated systems under dierent scenarios. The areas of integrated
systems with maize or soybean and livestock represent more than 90% of total observed data. The
outcomes for these integrated systems dier across scenarios. The addition of a restriction to recover
pasture (Priority scenario) increases the allocated area with soybean integration. The same occurs
under Combined scenario. Even if the technology representation for integration with maize and
soybean are similar these results are consequence of the regional aptitude and share of soybean
production.

3.1 Regional land-use changes

Regional outcomes of land-use changes are summarized in Figure 9. They are dierently across
regions since each regional economic structure is unique, however the outcomes among alternative
scenarios preserve direction and intensity.

Under Non-priority scenario South and Southeast regions show the largest shares of recovered
areas followed by Northeast Cerrado. These regions have lower recovery costs and large areas with
degraded pasture which means more suitability to actions present in the ABC Plan. Also these three
regions have an increase in natural areas and natural forest under all scenarios. It means the process
of recover degraded pasture slow the pressure over natural areas and settle area for other agricultural
activities, such as crops and planted forest. The same dynamic occurs under Priority and Combined
scenarios.

However, in the Center-West region there is a decrease in the natural areas and forests under
all scenarios. In the North region there is a decrease in the managed and planted forests, and a small
increase in the natural forest (private). Additionally, the pasture land in these regions increases more
than the recovered pasture under all scenarios. The same occurs in the Northeast Cerrado. This

12

result is unique when compare to the other regions. The Center-West region was the agricultural
frontier in Brazil during 80's. Nowadays, the region presents a large area of pasture land and the
livestock ranching is an important regional economic activity. The higher return of land allocated
to livestock compared to other land uses creates an incentive to keep pasture as the main land use,
even though with the ABC actions. The period between 1990-2014 was marked by the diusion
of dierent technologies such as no-till system, seed quality, legalization of planting of genetically
modied cultivars that simplied agricultural management and practices, as well as monetary and
market stability (Vieira Filho, 2014). These factors reshaped the agricultural frontier into Northeast
Cerrado region. Our results suggest at regional landscape, specially in the agricultural frontier the
technologies for pasture recovery and ICLs are not capable to promote land-sparing, as a result the
farmers keep pasture as the main land use. The ABC Plan should concern the complexity and
cost of establishing the necessary facilities to implement ICLs, which require technical and economic
expertise and other types of unattained knowledge (De Moraes et al., 2014); the absence of small-
scale business models that could be used on small-scale farms (GIL et al., 2015); and credit access,
technical extension and labour scarcity (LATAWIEC et al., 2017);

Third, the land-use changes are less sensible in the Northeast region when compare to other
regions in the model. Only under Priority scenario the land-use change in this region has a strong
response to the policy implementation. It shows the regional dependency of specic policies for this
region, which historically is the poorest region in Brazil. Also, the Caatinga biome represents a
challenge to the agricultural development in Brazil, because the region is a seasonally dry tropical
forest and consists of dry forest species rather than savanna species. On the other hand, the Northeast
Cerrado region shows an increase in the pasture land and as mentioned above, and an increase in the
natural and forest areas. This region represents a good opportunity for agricultural intensication
since is present in a large part of the Cerrado biome and presents soil with agricultural aptitude.

Figure 10 shows the outcomes of land-use by integrated systems and regions. These type of
technologies are not active in the benchmark equilibrium, consequently the results show absolute
value of area. Looking carefully the regional outcomes are extremely dependent on how the policy
scenario is designed and the parameters associated to them. Under Non-priority scenario, which

Source: research outcomes.

allows the free policy implementation, the Northeast Cerrado region has the largest areas of ICLs
(74%), followed by North region (26%). The large areas of pasture and degraded pasture associated to
low prices of intermediate inputs and primary factors attract the available resources for implementing
the ICLs. The restriction added under Priority and Combined scenarios interrupt the ow of resources
towards the Northeast Cerrado region. As a result, the area of ICLs drops drastically from 2.7 Mha
to 0.145 Mha. Also, the ICLs in the North region decrease from 0.956 Mha to 0.899 Mha representing

14

around 24.7% of total ICLs area.

The participation of other regions, such as South, Center-West reaches 41.6% and 27.3% of total
ICLs areas, respectively. The Southeast has only 2.4% of total. These results are strictly correlated
to the observed data of integrated systems in Brazilian regions. However, the scenarios simulation
shows that the implementation constraint increases the volume of resources allocated to carry out
the crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forestry technologies.

The rst insight here concerns about the ow of resources to Northeast Cerrado and North re-
gions under Non-priority scenario. Indeed, this scenario has the lowest cost for ICLs implementation
around R$ 5.9 billion. However, the model does not capture the implicit costs to carry out theses
technologies, such as land tenure, propriety rights, and infrastructure, specially for transportation,
which is extremely important for agricultural production.

Nevertheless, the other two scenarios show that technologies migrate to South, Center-West,
and North regions, as a result the policy cost is higher than the rst scenario. These regions show
higher prices for intermediate inputs and primary factors, specially land, which reect in the policy
costs. Also, in regions such as Center-West and Southeast, these new technologies are in competition
with traditional agricultural activities, which are technology-intensive with high specialization. It
might create barriers to the entry of low-carbon technologies.

4 Final remarks

The modeling results provide important quantitative insights and help identify stakeholders
that stand to benet or lose, along with the extent of impact on them. The ABC policy simulated
through priority areas of degraded pasture results in the highest decline in consumer welfare.

Under dierent simulated scenarios we have endeavored to analyze the land-use changes by
regions. Both policies with enforcement or not have shown that the pasture recovery associated to the
ICLs technologies are land-sparing technologies. As the productivity of recovered areas increase settle
area for new production systems, such as ICLs. ICL technologies have presented a great opportunity
for livestock intensication as well as reduce the pressure to clear new natural areas and forest areas
in Brazil. In fact, the model projects an increase of natural forest inside the rural establishments
indicating a growth in the agricultural income. Despite the regional costs of implementing each ICL
system the integration with soybean has shown economic advantages across regions, specially without
enforce policy.

The comparison of diferent production values per ha across sectos and ICLs has shown an
increase in the productivity, which could achieve around 20% in the Northeast Cerrado region. The
ICLs could improve the ecacy of investments, intensify land use, and provide a stable productive
system. Also, with the livestock integration the landholders have more options for diversication
and consequentially additional income.

At regional land-use level the outcomes have suggested a maintenance of some traditional
agricultural activities in their regions. It is the case of single livestock production in the Center-
West and North regions, rice in the South, and sugarcane in the Southeast and Northeast regions.
Concerning regional land-use changes only Center-West, North, and Northeast Cerrado have shown
an increase in pasture land more than the recovered area. It suggests that both traditional activities
as livestock ranching and the ICL systems increase this land-use category.
