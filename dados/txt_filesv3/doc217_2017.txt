Abstract

This paper provides estimates of the long-term impacts of prenatal exposure to
rainfall shocks using Colombian data.
I ﬁnd that individuals prenatally exposed
to excessive precipitation have fewer years of schooling, display increased rates of
illiteracy, have smaller cohort size, are less likely to work in the market, and are
more likely to report serious mental and physical illness. These eﬀects are generally
larger for males, especially when considering health outcomes. This paper then uses
geographical disaggregations of weather and agricultural cultivation to examine the
extent to which agricultural income shocks may be driving the relationship between
early rainfall conditions and later-life outcomes. The patterns I ﬁnd are generally
consistent with this hypothesis.

Introduction

It is now widely recognized that emissions of greenhouse will alter global climate, causing
extreme weather events, such as droughts and ﬂoods, to become more frequent. One
prominent body of work highlights that climate change may have serious repercussions
for children’s health and human capital acquisition, especially for children in the devel-
oping world. The prenatal programming theory indicates that individuals exposed to an
unhealthy environment during a sensitive period of fetal development are likely to suf-
fer from a number of health and developmental diﬃculties that persist throughout life
(Barker, 1997; Seckl, 1998). Since health is both a type of human capital and a contribu-
tor to other forms of human capital (Becker, 2007), increasing attention is being paid to
the long-run impacts of a variety of early life shocks, including the eﬀects of speciﬁc dis-
eases (Almond, 2006; Venkataramani, 2012; Barreca, 2010), maternal stress (Aizer et al.,
2016) and even food availability (Lindeboom et al., 2010; Almond and Mazumder, 2011).1
Yet, despite this plethora of evidence about the pervasive role of poor conditions in early
life, surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the long-run consequences of extreme
weather events. Estimates of the welfare consequences of early exposure to weather shocks
are crucial for the most eﬃcient design of climate change mitigation policies.

Existing research suggests several channels through which early rainfall shocks can
have intergenerational consequences on human capital and welfare. It is well established
that heavy precipitation increases the optimal conditions for infectious and parasitic dis-
eases, which could adversely aﬀect the health of pregnant mothers and fetal maturation
and thus increases the risk of poor health in early life. At the same time, lower yields
of subsistence crops and reduced income from cash crops due water scarcity or excess
precipitation may result in reduced nutrition intake during pregnancy, especially in coun-
tries with imperfect credit markets and fewer formal social safety net programs. As a
result, poor health in among school age children is likely to result in school absenteeism
and higher probabilities of dropping out, most notably causing fewer completed schooling
(Miguel and Kremer, 2004; Baird et al., 2016). Less educated individuals, in turn, have
poorer labor market prospects.2

This paper uses birth cohorts spanning several hundred locations over 40 years (1942-
1981) to conduct a systematic evaluation of the relationship between early rainfall shocks
and later-life outcomes. There are a few features about Colombia, the focus of this paper,
that make it an interesting case in which to study this question. Because Colombia is
exposed to both El Ni˜no and La Ni˜na phenomena, precipitation records vary widely over
time and space, with some periods characterized by heavy rainfall and others by pervasive
droughts. Indeed, Colombia has been considered one of the countries with the highest
incidence of extreme events. In 2010, the Global Climate Risk Index placed Colombia
in the top 3 countries most eﬀected by the impacts of loss related to ﬂoods and storms
(Andalon et al., 2016; Germanwatch, 2011). Moreover, the cohorts this paper analyses
were born in a context where a considerable fraction of population was living in rural
areas and depended on farming for a living either directly or indirectly. Thus, this paper
investigates a context where the aforementioned mechanisms are likely to be relevant.

My identiﬁcation strategy exploits variation in rainfall records over time within mu-
nicipalities. I construct a municipality-by-month weather dataset, which then is combined

with microdata by using date and place of birth to identify the prevailing rainfall con-
ditions during pregnancy. The empirical approach then compares later-life outcomes of
individuals who were prenatally exposed to extreme droughts or heavy rainfall relative to
those who experienced less severe rainfall conditions in utero. I control by a full set of
municipality-of-birth and month-of-birth × year-of-birth ﬁxed-eﬀects to account for time
invariant characteristics, aggregate shocks, and seasonal factors that might be correlated
with the incidence of extreme rainfall events. Hence, this approach exploits arguably
random ﬂuctuations in rainfall from municipality-speciﬁc deviations in long-term rainfall
after controlling for all seasonal factors and common shocks to all municipalities.

I examine several dimensions, including health, education and labor market outcomes,
and ﬁnd strong evidence that prenatal exposure to rainfall shocks leads to poorer adult
outcomes. I ﬁnd that individuals prenatally exposed to excessive precipitation have fewer
years of schooling, display increased rates of illiteracy, have smaller cohort size, are less
likely to work in the market, and are more likely to report serious mental and physical
illness. When I examine the impacts separately for males and females, I ﬁnd striking
diﬀerences, especially when considering health outcomes. For instance, the treatment
eﬀect of excess rainfall on mental disability is approximately 20 times larger for males
than for females. These gender heterogeneities are consistent with literature pointing out
that male fetuses are more vulnerable to in utero shocks than female fetuses (Almond and
Mazumder 2011; Eriksson et al. 2010; Kraemer 2000).

I then explore a set of additional heterogeneities that may provide insights on the
mechanisms at play. Understanding of speciﬁc mechanisms is critical for guiding the
targeting of policies. Policy implications when infectious and parasitic diseases are the
relevant mechanism may be diﬀerent from those when the relevant mechanism is reduced
agricultural income. In this paper, I focus on the role of agricultural income in driving
the associations between early rainfall conditions and later-life income. If the agricultural
income is in fact an important mechanism, one would expect to see larger eﬀects among
cohorts born in areas with a high fraction of population depending on farming and re-
lated agricultural activities for their livelihoods. I ﬁnd evidence generally consistent with
the agricultural income hypothesis.
I show, for example, that the treatment eﬀects of
excessive rainfall on years of schooling is about 20 times larger for cohorts born in areas
having a high share of population that is rural compared to their counterpart born in
low rural population rate areas. Moreover, the eﬀects tend to be smaller among more
recent cohorts, which were more likely to live in urban areas and experience technological
advances in agriculture that shield from weather events. While tentative, this evidence is
only suggestive of the agricultural income hypothesis, since I cannot completely rule out
alternative interpretations.

I am aware of only two papers, one by Maccini and Yang (2009) and one by Dinkelman
(2017), investigating the long-term consequences of rainfall shocks on adult wellbeing.
Using data from Indonesia, the former ﬁnds evidence that exposure to early droughts is
associated with poorer self-reported health and less grades of schooling. Remarkably, the
authors show that the eﬀects were largely driven by females. The latter study shows that
early drought exposure raises later-life disability rates in South Africa, with the eﬀects
concentrated in physical and mental disabilities.

Aside from distinguishing between heterogeneous eﬀects across diﬀerent geographical
disaggregations of weather and agricultural cultivation, this study contributes to the ex-
isting literature in two ways. First, I investigate the long-term eﬀects of rainfall shocks in

2

a context where both positive and negative precipitation shocks are likely to have adverse
consequences. Previous studies have focused exclusively on the long-run consequences
of droughts, but it is unclear whether one should expect the estimated eﬀects to be the
same across diﬀerent contexts. More rainfall may increase agricultural productivity and
household income in areas with water scarcity, improving nutrition and health. In other
contexts, however, heavy rainfall may reduce agricultural productivity and increase the
incidence of infectious diseases, contributing to a poorer fetal environment. In fact, when
I measure early rainfall shocks in the same way Maccini and Yang (2009) do, which as-
sumes that more heavy precipitation are unequivocally beneﬁcial events, I ﬁnd weaker
and generally not statistically signiﬁcant eﬀects.

Second, I focus on a country with no known son preferences, diﬀerently from Maccini
and Yang (2009) and Dinkelman (2017). This distinction is particularly important to
understand the gender heterogeneities of the eﬀects of early rainfall exposure. The evi-
dence on gender diﬀerences in the eﬀect of early rainfall on later-life outcomes has been
mixed. While Maccini and Yang (2009) ﬁnd that the eﬀects are the largest for females,
Dinkelman (2017) shows exactly the opposite. This should come as no surprise, since it is
unclear whether gender bias in household resource allocation is contributing to exacerbate
the repercussions of poor early health. An investigation of the gender diﬀerences in the
impacts of early rainfall shocks in country with no gender bias would allow to highlight
the importance of other mechanisms in driving the gender gap.

The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides information on the data,
while Section 3 introduces the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the main results and
robustness tests. Finally, Section 5 concludes.

2 Data

2.1 Weather data

This paper builds a series for temperature and precipitation using data from the Terres-
trial Air Temperature and Terrestrial Precipitation: 1900-2010 Gridded Monthly Time
Series, version 3.02, respectively (Matsuura and Willmott, 2012). This dataset provides
worldwide estimates for weather conditions at the 0.5 × 0.5 degree latitude/longitude
grid. Using an interpolation algorithm, Matsuura and Willmott (2012) compute values
for each grid node from several nearby weather stations. Following Rocha and Soares
(2015), I construct a municipality-by-month of weather panel. I begin by computing the
centroid for each of the municipalities and then located the four closest nodes to build a
monthly series as the weighted average of estimates related to these four nodes. I use the
inverse of the distance to each node as weight.

Using this consolidated dataset, I deﬁne a negative (positive) rainfall shock for a given
month if rainfall was one standard deviation below (above) historical average for that
calendar month within municipality. Since I am not comparing municipalities, the “ex-
treme” rainfall shock should not be taken in an absolute sense. These are simply extreme
rainfall shock months for each municipality within the given period. The historical av-
erage rainfall is calculated for each municipality and calendar month over the 1900-2010
period. Since early years did not have weather stations, Matsuura and Willmott (2012)
impute the data for missing years using a meteorological model. Thus, a natural concern
is bias from measurement error. However, I ﬁnd very similar results when considering the

3

1942-2010 period to construct both the historical mean and standard deviation.

I then measure prenatal exposure to droughts and ﬂoods according to the frequency
with which a given shock occurs in the 12 months prior to the individual’s birth. For
example, if an individual was born on December, then prenatal exposure to extreme
ﬂoods is computed as the share of months exposed to any positive rainfall shocks between
January and December. The same logic is used for prenatal drought exposure. The
use of 12 months prior to birth is important given the evidence suggesting that women’s
health status immediately before conception aﬀect infant health (Rocha and Soares, 2015;
Kudamatsu et al., 2012). I also present results that consider only the 9 months prior to
birth.

2.2 Census data

This paper uses microdata from the 2005 Colombia Census, the most recent full population
census available. I use a randomly drawn sample available through the Integrated Public
Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), a project to harmonize the coding census from several
countries (Ruggles and Sobek, 1997; Sobek et al., 2012). Importantly for my analysis,
the Census asks for municipality and exact date of birth. This information allows me to
match individuals with drought and wet shocks of the municipality where they were born
to identify prevailing rainfall conditions in early-life. I focus on adults aged 25-65 at the
time we see them in 2005 (cohorts born between 1942 and 1981).

The Census provides information on basic socio-economic and demographic charac-
teristics. I consider several adult outcomes. First, I explore years of schooling and an
indicator for illiteracy. Since young individuals are excluded from the analysis, these mea-
sures are likely to capture completed schooling. Second, I examine an indicator for having
any serious disability and the number of disabilities as measures of health human capital.
Individuals who reported having any disability are asked to provide information on the
type of disability, so I also construct indicators for individual disability types. These
include vision, hearing or speech, mental or physical disability. These disability measures
have been widely used in the literature linking early life shocks to later outcomes (Al-
mond, 2006; Almond and Mazumder, 2011; Lin and Liu, 2014). In addition to disability
outcomes, I consider also log cohort size. Previous studies have shown that cohort size is
a reasonable proxy for survival, so it can be used as additional measure of health human
capital. Unfortunately, the Census does not provide information on income. Hence, I use
an indicator for employment status as a proxy for labor market success.

The expanded sample consists of 18,843,493 individuals. Since the analysis exploits
the municipality-by-month-by-year variation in rainfall shocks, I collapse the data into
municipality-of-birth × month-of-birth × year-of-birth - cells and use the conditional
means as dependent variables. In the regressions, I weight the observations by the cell
size to adjust for precision with which the cell means are estimated. For the cohort size
analysis, each cell contains the total number of individuals born in a given place and
date. To explore potential heterogeneity in the treatment eﬀects, I collapse these data
separately for male and females. Estimates based on this type of group-means data are
asymptotically equivalent to the ones derived from the micro-data counterpart (Donald
and Lang, 2007), but the use of group-means data eases the computational burden.

Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the outcomes of interest. About 6 percent
of individuals have at least a disability and the average number of disabilities is 0.07.

4

The most common disability in the data is related to vision. The fraction of individuals
suﬀering from this condition is 3 percent. In contrast, the prevalence of mental disability
is relatively lower, with 0.8 percent of individuals reporting a serious mental disability.
While the prevalence of some disability types is relatively low, I show below that there is
suﬃcient variation across cohorts and birthplace for identiﬁcation. The mean schooling
level is 7.91. About 8 percent of individuals declared that do not know how to read or
write, and 56 percent of people have a job.

2.3 Agricultural data

Historical data on cultivation patterns at the municipality level are unavailable from
oﬃcial statistics registries in Colombia. Hence, I rely on interpolated data from the
Hystory Database of the Global Environment (HYDE). This database provides worldwide
decennial estimates of land used for crops on a 5’ latitude/longitude grid resolution. I use
a geo-spatial spatial sotware to aggregate the data to the municipality level. In particular,
the HYDE provides data on area under crops for calendar years in which the majority of
the crop is harvested. I focus on the amount of cultivated land as well as the amount of
cultivated land by rain-fed crops (both measured per capita). I then classify municipalities
into “low” and “high” categories based on the agricultural cultivation patterns observed
in 1940. Speciﬁcally, I will refer to low and high categories as municipalities in the ﬁrst
and third tertiles of distribution.3

I also classify municipalities into low and high categories based on the fraction of
population residing in rural areas. During the study period, a considerable fraction of
population was residing in rural areas, so there is relatively little variability across munic-
ipalities. Indeed, the median of the proportion of rural population in 1940 is 100 percent.
So, I use data from the 1993 Census, the earliest full population census available for
which there is suﬃcient variation in rural population rates. If areas with a relatively high
fraction of population depending on farming and related agricultural activities for their
livelihoods in the past continue to be the same areas with a relatively high fraction of pop-
ulation depending on agriculture today, then the use of data recent on rural population
rate will be informative. The evidence suggests that this may be reasonable. Conditional
on having a rural population rate lower than 100 percent in 1940, the correlation between
1940 and 1993 rural population rates is higher than 0.50.

2.4 Variation in rainfall shocks and outcomes

Because the statistical approach relies on within-municipality variation, I conﬁrm that
there is in fact substantial within-municipality variability in the data for identiﬁcation.
Figure 1 shows the spatial distribution of the incidence of rainfall shocks over time. Panels
(a) and (b) plots the frequency with which extreme drought and ﬂood shocks occur over
time and space, respectively. The ﬁgure reveals that the incidence of droughts and ﬂoods
varies sharply across municipalities within a given month. Episodes of rainfall shocks
occur, on average, in 10 percent of the Colombian municipalities. Yet, there are periods

3Although the HYDE provides geographically detailed historical data on cultivation patterns, they
are interpolated and thus likely subject to considerable measurement error. As a robustness check, I use
data on cultivation practices which are readily available for 1993 from the Colombian Bureau of Statistics
(DANE). I ﬁnd results that are in line with those derived from the HYDE data.

5

with pervasive rainfall shocks hitting almost 80 percent of the municipalities as well as
periods with no municipality experiencing such a shock.

To evaluate the within-municipality variability in the data more formally, I regress
the measures of early rainfall shocks for a cell on a full set of municipality ﬁxed eﬀects
and month-by-year ﬁxed eﬀects. The residual variation of these regressions is a direct
measure of within-municipality variability. An R-squared close to 0 is counted as evidence
of substantial within-municipality variation.
I ﬁnd that about 75 percent of the total
variation in drought and ﬂood shocks cannot be explained by this set of ﬁxed eﬀects. When
I account for speciﬁc-municipality linear time trends in addition, I ﬁnd still substantial
within-municipality variation, with 60 percent of the variation due to within-municipality
diﬀerences.

I also compute the within-municipality variation for adult outcomes. Municipality
and time ﬁxed eﬀects cannot explain 70 percent of the variation in years in schooling,
and this hardly changes when speciﬁc-municipality time trends are accounted for. I ﬁnd
also that a substantial portion of the total variation of employment status is due to
within-municipality diﬀerences, about 80 percent. Conditional on speciﬁc-municipality-
of-birth linear time trends, and ﬁxed eﬀects for municipality-of-birth and month-of-birth
× year-of-birth, the variation in disability outcomes ranges from 88 to 95 percent. The
within-municipality variation for log cohort size is notably lower, but it is still relevant for
identiﬁcation. Indeed, 12 percent of the variation in log cohort size is within-municipality.

3 Empirical Strategy

To measure the relationship between early-life rainfall shocks and later-life outcomes, I
use the following speciﬁcation:

Outcomejmt = α + β1F loodjmt + β2Droughtjmt + γZjmt + θT rendtm × Mj

+ ηj + µmt + ξjmt

(1)

for cohorts born in municipality j, month m and year t. Outcome is the dependent
variable of interest, either an education or health outcome. Drought and F lood are the
fraction of negative and positive rainfall shocks during the 12 months prior to birth,
respectively. The covariates Z include a set of predetermined individual characteristics,
such as sex and race. In all speciﬁcations, I control for speciﬁc-municipality linear time
trends (T rendtm × Mj) to account for factors changing over time that might aﬀect the
outcomes of interest.
The models include municipality-of-birth ﬁxed eﬀects (ηj), which absorb any unob-
servable time-invariant determinants of adult outcomes, including initial conditions, geog-
raphy, and speciﬁc-area risks of diseases. The set of month-of-birth × year-of-birth ﬁxed
eﬀects controls for common time trends such as seasonal ﬂuctuation in later outcomes,
macroeconomic conditions and common national policies. All our models use robust stan-
dard errors adjusted for clustering at the municipality level to account for serial correlation
(Bertrand et al., 2004).

The coeﬃcients β1 and β2 measure the eﬀects of early-life exposure to rainfall shocks
on the adult outcomes of interest. My quasi-experimental design rests on the assumption
that the occurrence of extreme rainfall events is uncorrelated with omitted determinants

6

of later-life outcomes. This assumption is plausible insofar as parents are unlikely to
anticipate precisely a rainfall shock at a given moment in time and place. By conditioning
on the full set of municipality and time ﬁxed eﬀects and local-speciﬁc time trends, the
analysis uses arguably random ﬂuctuations in rainfall from municipality-speciﬁc deviations
in long-term rainfall after accounting for all seasonal factors and common shocks to all
municipalities.

While the empirical design is compelling in principle, I still address several identiﬁca-
tion issues that may arise when following this statistical framework. First, one may be
concerned if more-educated and higher quality parents are more likely to postpone fertil-
ity when exposed to extreme rainfall shocks around time of conception. To address this
issue, I explore the robustness of the results when considering rainfall shocks occurring
in the 9 months before month, when fertility decisions are likely made. As shown below,
the results from these models are in line with the main ﬁndings, supporting the validity
of the research design.

Second, a bias may arise if diﬀerent types of women are likely to migrate away from
areas aﬀected by extreme droughts or ﬂoods while pregnancy. It seems implausible that
this is the case given I focus on temporary variations in rainfall and by the low migration
rates of pregnant women. Fortunately, the Census collects information on the municipality
where an individual lived ﬁve years earlier.
I then compares rainfall shocks between
migrant and non-migrant families during the ﬁve years prior to census. Consistent with
the view that migration is unlikely to be related temporary variations in rainfall, I ﬁnd no
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in rainfall shocks during the ﬁve years prior to census
between migrants and non-migrants. Although I cannot entirely rule out the possibility
of migration during pregnancy, these data suggest that it is unlikely to be a major source
of bias.

Third, as the sample is based on surviving (and presumably higher quality) individuals,
a potential issue is selectively mortality, either during pregnancy or in early infancy. While
most miscarriage happens in the ﬁrst trimester, there is possibility of late miscarriage
and stillbirth. If rainfall exposure during pregnancy or early infancy aﬀects this culling
process, any estimated impacts after birth would need to be a combination of selection
and a direct treatment eﬀect. However, any bias from using this selected sample most
likely will bias the estimates of the eﬀects early-life rainfall shocks towards zero. If so,
my estimates should be taken to be lower bound of the eﬀect of the true eﬀect and large
impacts would even become more telling. Therefore, I am less concerned about bias from
selective mortality.

4 Results

4.1 Main ﬁndings

Table 2 reports the estimates of the eﬀect of rainfall shocks on adult outcomes. All
regression results are based on the full speciﬁcation that adjusts for municipality-of-birth
ﬁxed eﬀects, month-of-birth × year-of-birth ﬁxed eﬀects, speciﬁc-municipality time trends
and the set of predetermined individual characteristics. Sample sizes and R-squared’s of
the regressions are shown at the bottom of the table.

Column (1) shows evidence that greater prenatal exposure to extreme ﬂoods reduces
cohort size. For this outcome, the estimate of β1 is -0.0499 (standard error = 0.0177),

7

which is statistically diﬀerent from zero at the 1 percent level of signiﬁcance. This estimate
implies that an increase of one standard deviation in the fraction of early extreme ﬂoods
leads to a 0.67 percent decrease in cohort size. With cohort size interpreted as cumulative
survival, this result indicates that exposure to excess rainfall in utero is associated with
decreased mortality.

Columns (2)-(3) look at an indicator for any serious disability and the number of
disabilities, respectively. There is no evidence that early-life rainfall shocks are associated
with changes in the prevalence of disabilities, with estimates of the parameter of interest
statistically indistinguishable from zero at the conventional levels of signiﬁcance. However,
these aggregate measures of disabilities may mask important form of heterogeneities across
disability types. With this in mind, columns (4)-(7) explores the eﬀects of early rainfall
shocks on disability types. I ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of excessive rainfall on
mental disability, with an estimated coeﬃcient of interest of 0.0030 and standard error of
0.0011. Thus, an increase of one standard deviation in the fraction of early excess rainfall
implies an increase of 0.047 percentage points in the probability of adult mental disability.
Relative to the mean mental disability rate of 0.79, this implies an increase of 5.1 percent
in the incidence of this disability. I ﬁnd also a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between
prenatal ﬂoods and physical disability. The point estimate of the coeﬃcient of interest
0.0047 (standard error = 0.0021) indicates that an increase of one standard deviation in
the fraction of prenatal ﬂoods exposure is associated with an increase of 0.063 percentage
points in the prevalence of physical disabilities. Relative to the mean, this estimate
suggests a 2.6-percent increase. I do not ﬁnd any evidence that early rainfall shocks aﬀect
other disability types.

To better place the results in perspective, I compare these estimated eﬀects to the
diﬀerences in the disability outcomes between less- and more-educated individuals. This
seems to be a relevant comparison given the well-established striking correlation between
health and education.4 In our sample, an increase of one standard deviation in years of
education is associated with a increase of 0.48 in the probability of reporting a serious
mental disability.5 Relative to this diﬀerence, the estimated eﬀect of prenatal ﬂood on
this outcome is about 10 percent. The same comparison for physical disability reveals a
similar relative diﬀerence.

Column (8) investigates the relationship between early rainfall shocks and years of
schooling. I ﬁnd evidence that greater exposure to excessive rainfall in early-life leads
to fewer years of schooling, with β1 estimate at -0.1183 (standard error = 0.0616). For
comparison, Duﬂo (2001) ﬁnds that a large school construction program leads to an
increase of 0.15 years of education in Indonesia. Column (9) presents the results for
illiteracy and suggests that a signiﬁcantly signiﬁcant eﬀect of early extreme wets. The rate
of illiteracy among individuals experiencing a 50 percent prenatal exposure to excessive
rainfall is increased by 0.38 percentage points relative to those who were not exposed to
any positive rainfall shock in utero. This is about 4.7 percent at the mean illiteracy rate.
Finally, column (10) examines early rainfall impacts on employment. I ﬁnd statistically
signiﬁcant eﬀects of both extreme droughts and ﬂoods.
Indeed, exposure to positive
or negative rainfall shocks results in lower employment rate. The eﬀect of excessive
rainfall is larger in magnitude than that of extreme droughts. The estimated coeﬃcients

indicate that individuals spent 50 percent of their prenatal period experiencing positive
and negative rainfall shocks are 1.08 and 0.7 percentage points less likely to work in
adulthood, respectively.

4.2 Heterogeneity in treatment eﬀects

results from running regressions separately for males and females. The results for the log
cohort regressions indicate larger impacts of excess rainfall for males than for females. An
increase of one standard deviation in the extreme ﬂood exposure in the 12 months prior
to birth results in a 0.87 percent smaller cohort for males. For females, the corresponding
treatment eﬀect is about 0.48 percent smaller cohort size, although it is indistinguishable
from zero. The results for disabilities also suggest larger impacts for males. In contrast
to the baseline estimates, I now observe statistically signiﬁcant impacts of prenatal ﬂoods
on the probability of reporting any serious disability and the number of disabilities. The
results indicate that males who spent 50 percent of the prenatal period in ﬂoods are 0.40
percentage points more likely to report any serious disability and have on average 0.006
more disabilities, which represent increases of 6 and 8 percent relative to the baseline
mean, respectively. These eﬀects are largely drive by mental and physical disabilities.
The diﬀerences between males and females in point estimates are generally statistically
signiﬁcant and strikingly large. In particular, I ﬁnd that the estimated eﬀect of prenatal
ﬂood on the number of disabilities among males is 135 times as large as among females.
There are also striking diﬀerences in the the eﬀect of prenatal ﬂood on years of school-
ing between males and females. The corresponding eﬀect of exposure to extreme negative
rainfall shocks is about 3 times larger for males. Now, one standard deviation increase in
the early excess rainfall exposure results in 0.024 fewer years of schooling for males. In
contrast, in the case of illiteracy, I ﬁnd that the eﬀect of prenatal exposure to excessive
rainfall is somewhat larger for females, with point estimates of 0.0053 (standard error
=0.0039) for males and of 0.009 (standard error=0.0040) for females. However, I cannot
reject the null hypothesis that both estimates are the same. Finally, I ﬁnd that the es-
timates of rainfall shock eﬀects on employment are larger in magnitude for females than
for males. The results suggest that females who spent 50 percent of the prenatal period
in ﬂoods and droughts are 1.3 and 1.09 less likely to working, respectively. For males, the
coeﬃcients are imprecisely estimated and are therefore not able to reject the hypothesis
of treatment eﬀects equal to zero.

Overall, the results suggest strong gender heterogeneities. Taken in their entirety, the
results tend to show larger treatment eﬀects for males than for females when considering
health and education outcomes. The patterns I ﬁnd here are in general inconsistent with
Maccini and Yang (2009), who show larger eﬀects for females in Indonesia, but are in
line with Dinkelman (2017), who ﬁnd stronger impacts of droughts for males in South
Africa. A major distinction between the setting that these authors study and mine is that
Colombia is a country with not known gender bias at early ages. Indeed, the sex ratio
at birth, which has emerged as an indicator of sex-discrimination at early ages, is in the
normal range 104-107. Thus, it seems implausible that sex discrimination accounts for
the gender diﬀerences in the eﬀects I document here. Rather, my ﬁndings are consistent
with the literature on fragile males, which attributes gender diﬀerences to diﬀerences in

9

ability to produce nutrients in the placenta. This is supported by studies documenting
gender-speciﬁc eﬀects of diﬀerent shocks during pregnancy (Ross and Desai, 2005).

It is interesting that eﬀects on employment are larger for females. Since employment is
an outcome largely determined by employers, and thus supplier control over it is relatively
limited, this ﬁnding may be taken as supporting evidence for the hypothesis of gender
discrimination in the labor market. This is consistent with a large literature in developing
countries showing sharp gender gaps in labor market outcomes for a women and men with
similar observable characteristics.6 In our data, women are about 40 percentage points
more likely to be engaged in the labor market than men are, even conditional on education,
age and race. While my ﬁndings are suggestive of sex discrimination in the labor market,
further research is required to clarify these relationships.

4.2.2 Agro-climatic heterogeneities

Next, I assess the extent to which agricultural income shocks may drive the relationship
between prenatal rainfall and later-life outcomes. I ﬁrst explore whether adult outcomes
are more responsive to rainfall shocks in dry and wet areas. Reductions in precipitation
may lead to larger reductions in agricultural production and higher increases in food
prices in areas facing extremely dry conditions and constant moisture deﬁcit than in areas
with higher baseline rainfall. In contrast, the negative eﬀects of heavy rainfall periods
on agriculture are likely to be more salient in areas with high long-term mean rainfall
and relying on crops which are more sensitive to excessive precipitation. If the eﬀects
of prenatal rainfall shocks on later-life outcomes operate through an agricultural income
channel, one would expect to see larger eﬀects among cohorts born in areas with low and
high long-term mean rainfall relative to those born in areas with less extreme rainfall
conditions.

To investigate this formally, I disaggregate the sample into municipalities characterized
by long-term rainfall that is in the ﬁrst and third tertile of distribution. I refer to these
as the “dry” and “wet” samples. The results of this exercise are presented in Table 4.
Compared to the baseline estimates in Table 2, I ﬁnd that the eﬀects of excess rainfall in
utero are larger in magnitude in the wet sample. A striking example is years of schooling.
While complete exposure to excessive rainfall in utero leads to 0.30 fewer years of schooling
in the wet sample, it has an eﬀect that is about 3 times smaller in the entire sample. In
contrast, I ﬁnd generally statistically insigniﬁcant eﬀects of rainfall shocks in the dry
sample, suggesting that excessive rainfall is the main driver of the relationship between
early rainfall shocks and later-life outcomes.

Table 5 examines the long-term eﬀects of rainfall shocks in areas with low and high
amount of cultivated land (per inhabitants). Again, if agricultural income is an important
mechanism behind my ﬁndings, one would expect to see larger eﬀects among cohorts born
in areas depending directly on farming for a living. This prediction is supported by the
regression estimates. In general, I observe larger estimates in magnitude among cohorts
born in areas with high amount of cultivated land per capita. For example, the eﬀect of
excess rainfall in utero on the number of adult disabilities among individuals born in high
cultivated areas is 176 times as large as among those born in low cultivated areas.

6For a general review of literature, see Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer (2005). Prominent studies
on the gender gap in Colombia include Angel-Urdinola and Wodon (2006), Hoyos et al. (2010), and Galvis
(2010).

10

Table 6 explores heterogeneities among cohorts born in areas with low and high amount
of cultivated land by rain-fed crops (per inhabitants). I continue to ﬁnd results consistent
with the agricultural income hypothesis: the eﬀects are the largest among cohorts born in
areas depending on rain-fed crops. Striking large diﬀerences in the treatment eﬀects are
observed for cohort size and disabilities outcomes. When I consider years of schooling, the
coeﬃcient on ﬂoods is imprecisely estimated, possibly because of the reduced sample size,
but it is negative and slightly larger in high rain-fed crop areas relative to the baseline
estimate in Table 2.

I now compare the treatment eﬀects in areas with high and low share of population
that is rural. The results in Table 7 show that the eﬀects of ﬂoods on later-life outcomes
are larger in areas with higher rural population rate.
In particular, I ﬁnd substantial
diﬀerences when I examine years of schooling. The estimated coeﬃcient on ﬂood for
this outcome is -0.44 (standard error=0.11) for individuals born in high rural population
rate areas and -0.022 (standard error=0.085) for those born in low rural population rate
areas. I also ﬁnd larger eﬀects of droughts in areas with high fraction of rural population,
although the diﬀerences are statistically signiﬁcant in some few cases.

Between 1940 and 1980, Colombia experienced a substantial transformation from an
agricultural and mainly rural economy to a predominantly urban economy. So it is natural
to expect that there will have been changes in the relationship between early rainfall
shocks and adult outcomes. Indeed, more individuals living in urban areas and employed
in non-farm activities implies fewer families directly depending on agriculture for a living.
These changes would imply smaller eﬀects of rainfall shocks among more recent cohorts.
To evaluate this, I run the regressions separately for cohorts born before and after 1960.
A natural shortcoming of this exercise is that the eﬀects of prenatal rainfall shocks for
a given individual may be increasing throughout life, so diﬀerent eﬀects across cohorts
may be the result of this mechanism rather than changes in agricultural income patterns.
But since I focus on individuals aged 25-65, which are likely to have completed their
schooling, the “age” channel should be a minor issue for education outcomes. Although
the coeﬃcients are estimated very imprecisely likely due to reduced sample sizes, I ﬁnd
a consistent pattern showing larger eﬀects in magnitude for more recent cohorts (Table
8). The estimated coeﬃcient on ﬂood for years of schooling is about 10 times larger for
individuals born before 1960 than for those born after 1960. In the same vein, complete
exposure to ﬂoods in utero reduces the probability of being illiterate by 0.9 percentage
points among individuals born before 1960, while it implies a reduction of 0.46 percentage
points among individuals born after 1960.

Taken in their entirety, these results are consistent with the existence of an agricultural
income mechanism. Of course, this evidence is only suggestive since I cannot completely
rule out other alternative interpretations. In particular, areas with diﬀerent agricultural
and weather patterns are likely to diﬀer in dimensions that may contribute to the treat-
ment eﬀects of rainfall shocks. For example, rural areas are likely to have less access to
health care and higher long-term poverty, so families residing in such areas may be less
able to remediate the adverse eﬀects of poor neonatal health. In addition, I do not ﬁnd
signiﬁcant heterogeneities in some few cases, which suggests that other mechanisms may
be also important. In any case, my ﬁndings can be taken as initial evidence on the role of
agricultural in the relationship between prenatal rainfall shocks and later-life outcomes.

11

4.3 Robustness checks

I conduct a number of other speciﬁcation checks to test the robustness of the main results
(Not shown here due to space limitations). As mentioned above, a natural concern with
the research designed is that diﬀerent parents may change fertility decisions if they are
exposed to a severe rainfall shock around conception time. Since I have information on the
month of birth, I can explore this possibility by examining the robustness of the results
when considering exposure measures based on rainfall shocks in the 9 months prior to
birth. The use of this type of exposure measures should largely diminish the potential
bias induced by parents changing fertility decisions around conception. The results of this
exercise and suggests evidence highly consistent with the baseline ﬁndings. Indeed, point
estimates are very similar to the ones that consider exposure measures based on rainfall
shocks in the 12 months prior to birth. As an additional check, I estimate models that
include exposure to rainfall shocks in 12 and 13-24 months before birth. Interestingly,
the estimated coeﬃcients of interest are virtually identical to the ones in the benchmark
speciﬁcation, while the eﬀects of exposure to droughts and ﬂoods 13-24 months before
birth are statistically indistinguishable from zero. This ﬁnding suggests that changes in
fertility around conception time is unlikely to be a major issue.

I also consider alternative measures of rainfall shocks. First, I deﬁne early rainfall
shocks by the deviation of rainfall 12 months before birth from the average historical
yearly rainfall in each municipality. More speciﬁcally, the variable is the natural log of
prenatal rainfall minus the natural log of mean annual rainfall in the given municipality.
This is the measure used by Maccini and Yang (2009). When I follow this speciﬁcation, I
ﬁnd estimates of the eﬀect of prenatal rainfall shocks that are statistically signiﬁcant only
in some few cases. Indeed, I ﬁnd that higher rainfall relative to the normal local rainfall
is associated with fewer years of schooling and increased rates of illiteracy, but there is no
evidence of signiﬁcant eﬀects for the rest of outcomes. These weaker estimates is perhaps
unsurprising given the non-linear relationship between early rainfall and adult outcomes
I document above.

Second, I deﬁne a positive (negative) rainfall shock for a given month if rainfall was
above the 90th (below the 10th) percentile of the distribution for that calendar month
within the municipality. The fractions of early drought and excess rainfall are computed
using these deﬁnitions of extreme drought and wet months. The results are in general
consistent with the baseline, although are imprecisely estimated in some cases.

Third, I deﬁne extreme droughts and ﬂoods based on the Spatial Precipitation Index
(SPI). The SPI relaxes the assumption of normality and ﬁts a gamma distribution to rain-
fall data before constructing measures of the deviation of rainfall from average historical
rainfall in a given municipality. Having computed drought and ﬂood months based on the
SPI score, the fraction of early exposure to either extreme droughts or ﬂoods is calculated
using the same logic as in the baseline measures. Using exposure measures based on the
SPI leads to results that are very similar to the baseline ﬁndings.

Previous studies have documented seasonal ﬂuctuations in adult outcomes according
to the month of birth that may be driven by factors other than rainfall variations (Buckles
and Hungerman, 2013). Although I control for month-of-birth × year-of-birth ﬁxed eﬀects
in all regressions, one could be even concerned if there is speciﬁc-regional seasonal variation
in adult outcomes spuriously correlated with variation in rainfall shocks. I examine this
issue by estimating models that control for a full set of municipality-of-birth × month-

12

of-birth ﬁxed eﬀects. Point estimates are virtually identical to the ones derived from the
baseline speciﬁcation, casting doubt on this additional source of bias.

5 Conclusion

The health and other consequences of extreme weather events are an increasing salient
issue in the public debate about the costs and beneﬁts of climate change mitigation
policies. Several scholars highlight that more heavy rainfall and droughts will have serious
repercussions for children’s development in poorer and more fragile states. Yet, despite
its importance in the public debate, there is even little research to date documenting
the long-run eﬀects of rainfall shocks on human capital and welfare. This paper uses
Colombian data to gain new insights into the eﬀects of early ﬂoods and droughts on later-
life welfare. I show that prenatal exposure to ﬂoods result in fewer years of schooling,
increased rates of illiteracy, smaller cohort size, higher unemployment rate, and increased
rates of disabilities. Remarkably, these eﬀects are generally larger for males, especially
when considering health outcomes.

To test the extent to which agricultural income shocks may be an important driver
behind the relationship between early rainfall shocks and later-life outcomes, I explore
heterogeneities in treatment eﬀects across an array of geographical disaggregations.
I
ﬁnd substantially larger eﬀects of prenatal ﬂoods among cohorts born in areas having a
high fraction of rural population and high amount of cultivated land by rain-fed crops.
Furthermore, the eﬀects are smaller among more recent cohorts, when a higher fraction
of population were living in urban areas and did not depend on farm related activities.
Together, these results provide evidence for the operation of an agricultural channel.
Naturally, other mechanisms, such as shocks in the prevalence of diseases, may be also
important. Future studies, perhaps combining exogenous changes in the agricultural prac-
tices and the incidence of speciﬁc diseases, would allow to draw more deﬁnitive conclusions
about the relative roles of both channels of impacts.
