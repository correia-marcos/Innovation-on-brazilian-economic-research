Abstract

Global climate and environmental change have increased in the last decades. Increased health stress is
one of the most alarming consequences of these changes. Although many studies have tried to estimate
the direct and indirect consequences of a warmer and drier environment for the economy, both at a global
and local scale, a smaller number of studies have addressed the mid and long term health implications of
these changes at a regional level. Building on their previous work, this study takes a multi-stage approach
to estimate the climate-related consequences on cardiovascular/respiratory and infectious/vector-borne
diseases, morbi/mortality, and labor supply in Brazil. Combining Spatial Bayes Smoothing, Spatial
Econometrics, Global Burden of Disease data, and a Regional Computable General Equilibrium model,
this study estimates the future development of climate-sensitive health disorders, their implications for
morbi-mortality, and the consequences for labor supply and productivity for the Brazilian states and re-
gions from 2010 to 2040. Our results suggest that partial effects of climate change on health and labor
supply is higher than the total impact (from general equilibrium estimates). Increased morbi-mortality
and labor loss would be higher for vector-borne and infectious than for non-communicable diseases, and
mostly concentrated in less developed regions of the country.

1 Introduction

Global climate and environmental change have aggravated in the last decades (Nordell, 2007). Increased
health stress is one of the most alarming consequences of these changes. The impacts of climate change
on human health is complex, ranging from more direct consequences, such as increase in the prevalence of
climate-sensitive diseases and in the demand for health care, to more indirect impacts, such as loss in labor
supply (temporary through morbidity or permanent through deaths) and productivity (Pattanayak et al.,
2009).

Although many studies have tried to estimate the direct and indirect consequences of a warmer and dryer
environment for the economy, both at the global and the local scales, a smaller number of studies have ad-
dressed the mid and long term health implications of these changes at a regional level. Some studies are
notable exceptions, such as the simulation of the economy-wide consequences of future climate change for
human health conducted by Bosello et al. (2006). In Brazil, some studies have suggested climate-sensitive
future scenarios of regional vulnerability (Barbieri et al., 2015), migration (Barbieri et al., 2010), agriculture
productivity (Domingues et al., 2016), and infectious diseases (Barcellos et al., 2009). None of these stud-
ies, however, evaluates the health and wealth impacts of climate change as a dynamic process. Pattanayak
et al. (2009) is one of the few exceptions, although their model do not compute the climate impact on labor
supply through morbidity and mortality losses (gains) at a regional scale. Nor they recursively compute
deaths due to climate in their population projection estimates.

Building on their previous work, this study takes a multi-stage approach to estimate the climate-related
consequences on cardiovascular/respiratory and infectious/vector-borne diseases, morbi/mortality, and la-
bor supply in Brazil. Combining Spatial Bayes Smoothing, Spatial Econometrics, data on the Global Bur-
den of Disease, and a Regional Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, we estimate the future
development of climate-sensitive health disorders, their implications for loss (gain) in morbidity and mor-
tality, and the consequences for labor supply, family consumption, and economic growth for the Brazilian
states and regions from 2010 to 2040. As far as we know, this is the only study estimating the impact of
climate change on health and economic development at the regional level.

2 Materials and Methods

To evaluate the impact of climate change on the Brazilian economy as a result of its impacts on the labor
supply through health, we combine different sources of data and analytical strategies. Population health
was proxied by two groups of variables: disease notiﬁcations (dengue, malaria, and leishmaniosis) and
hospitalizations (circulatory, respiratory, and infectious diseases). These health indicators were derived
from administrative health records by municipality. Climate parameters were proxied by precipitation
(total amount of rain within one year and its standard deviation) and temperature (12-month average). The
climate scenario used in this analysis was the Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5.

The effect of climate change on the labor supply was obtained by a two-step strategy. The ﬁrst step
estimates the relationship between climate change and health. Building on Bosello et al. (2006) and Pat-
tanayak et al. (2009), the second step analyses to what extent health losses due to climate change affects the
labor supply based on the Global Burden of Disease parameters (WHO, 2016). The change in the number
of cases estimated for the working age population (labor supply) was used in a computable general equi-
librium model to verify the effect of climate change on the Brazilian economy by 2040. Our IMAGEM-B
(Integrated Multiregional Applied General Equilibrium Model - Brazil) incorporates detailed data for the
Brazilian economy, yielding the climate impact on the main macroeconomic variables, such as Gross Do-
mestic Product (GDP), employment, and family consumption. These impacts are reported at both national
and state levels and are evaluated as the percentage cumulative deviation from a base scenario without
considering the change in the climate parameters (business-as-usual).

2.1 Data and Variables
2.1.1 Climate Parameters
Historical Climate Data

In this study, we use data provided by the Center of Weather Forecast and Climate Studies (CPTEC), at the
Brazilian Institute for Spatial Research (INPE). Measured on a daily basis by municipality from 1900 to
2010, the climate data were transformed into annual averages.

Precipitation data were classiﬁed as precipitation intensity and precipitation dispersion. Precipitation
intensity was measured as the total amount of precipitation within a year. Precipitation dispersion was
measured as the standard deviation of the monthly precipitation within a year. Although many studies use
precipitation intensity only (Bosello et al., 2006), we included precipitation dispersion in order to capture
the effect of the rainfall distribution throughout the year on climate-sensitive diseases (Hashizume et al.,
2008; Pattanayak et al., 2009). Our temperature parameter represents the annual average temperature by
municipality. For the econometric models testing the effect of these climate parameters on climate-sensitive
health measures we use data for 2005 (base year). Figure 1 summarizes these measures and how they were
applied to the econometric analysis.

Future Climate Scenarios

To simulate the impact of climate change on health, we use the Representative Concentration Pathways
(RCP) 8.5 climate scenario provided by INPE. Based on the Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives
and their General Environmental Impact (MESSAGE), the RCP 8.5 scenario assumes future economic
growth, increased emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), and the absence of effective climate policies. Data
for this scenario were based on the EtaHG2ES global circulation model with a spatial resolution of 0.2
degrees. In this scenario, the lack of effective climate mitigation policies leads to a considerable increase in
GHG emissions over time, resulting in a radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m2 by 2100 (Riahi et al., 2011).

Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of annual average temperature for Brazil in 2010 and 2040,
based on the RCP 8.5 climate scenario. Overall, municipalities experience a steady increase in temperature

over time, with a larger number of municipalities scoring average temperatures above 24 degrees Celsius.
Increase in temperature would be mostly concentrated in the Center-West, west of Minas Gerais, Maranh˜ao,
Piau´ı, and a large portion of the Eastern Brazilian Amazon. In contrast, the South region would have little
variation, with some municipalities experiencing declining temperatures.

Figure 3 represents the spatial distribution of total annual precipitation over the same period. Along with
increased temperature, most municipalities would experience a drier environment by 2040. The reduction
in total rainfall would be mostly felt in a long corridor stretching from the Northeast sert˜ao to the north part
of Minas Gerais. S˜ao Paulo and large areas of the Brazilian Amazon would also be affected. In the South
of Brazil, however, rainfall would increase.

2.1.2 Population Health Measures

We use two groups of climate-sensitive health indicators as summarized in Figure 4: indicators of hospital-
izations by selected causes and disease notiﬁcations. Data on hospitalizations are provided by the Autho-
rization Forms for Hospital Admittance. This information refers to in-patient care received in the Brazilian
Public Health Care System, which responds for 66% of total hospitalizations in the country (IBGE, 2014).
Data on disease notiﬁcations are provided by the Notiﬁable Disease Information System. All health data
were obtained at the municipality level, using the municipality of residence instead of municipality of oc-
currence as the criterion of data selection.

Disease counts are based on a 5-year average centered in 2012. The population used to calculate the
baseline rates of climate-sensitive diseases by municipality are the 2012 population estimates from the
Brazilian Bureau of Statistics1. These rates represent number of cases by 1000 persons, and were corrected
by the Spatial Empirical Bayes smoother to reduce potential small-area estimation bias (Anselin and Rey,
2014).

1For dengue notiﬁcations, data were only available until 2012, so we used an average centered in 2010. Because of that, data

on population used to estimate dengue prevalence was based on the 2010 Demographic Census.

2.1.3 Sociodemographic Measures

Health indicators are sensitive to key demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population
(Dahlgren and Whitehead, 1991). To account for these confounding effects on the relation between climate
and health, we include the following variables in our econometric analysis: proportion of individuals 0 to 14
years old, proportion of individuals 60 years old and above, proportion of women, proportion of individuals
in urban areas, mean per capita household income, Gini Coefﬁcient, and per capita health expenditures. All
control variables are estimated at the municipality level. Data were obtained from the 2010 Demographic
Census, except for the per capita health expenditures. The latter was provided by the Information System
on health public budgets (SIOPS, in Portuguese).

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Estimating the impact of climate change on labor supply through its impact on health
Model 1: Impact of climate on health

Assessing the relationship between climate change and health requires information on both indicators cov-
ering a sufﬁciently long time span. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1990), for
instance, deﬁnes climate change as a statistically signiﬁcant variation in a climate parameter over a long
period, typically measured in decades. Although we have reliable longitudinal data on climate, time series
for health measures in Brazil are uncommon. The few longitudinal health data available in the country lack
reliability, especially before the 1990’s when the Brazilian Public Health System was created. A commonly
used strategy to overcome this limitation is to estimate relations between health and other parameters (such
as climate) using cross-sectional data at the municipality level. This strategy allows us to capture hetero-
geneity for the indicators used, since the Brazilian municipalities are highly diverse in their socioeconomic,
health, and climate attributes (Barbieri et al., 2015).

In this study, we estimate the relation between climate and health using econometric analysis of cross-
sectional data for all 5.565 Brazilian municipalities. The dependent variable is a measure of the average
population health (log of the rates of hospitalization and disease notiﬁcations). Our key independent vari-
ables - the climate parameters - were measured in 2005 (our base year). The models control for socioeco-
nomic and demographic characteristics, as explained in Section 2.1.3. The association between climate and
health in this study is described by the following generic function:

(1)

where:

• lnΘk,m = log of the k-th morbidity rate in municipality m
• Rm = annual total rainfall in municipality m
• σ(Rm) = standard deviation of rainfall in municipality m
• Tm = average temperature in municipality m
• Em = vector of sociodemographic attributes of municipality m
Ordinarily Least Square (OLS) models are routinely applied (Pattanayak et al., 2009). However, OLS
estimators are biased in the presence of spatial dependence of error terms, violating the assumption of
a diagonal error matrix. This is particularly true in the case of health and climate parameters. Vector-
borne diseases, for instance, tend to cluster spatially due to vector mobility (Winters et al., 2010). Climate
parameters and their variation are also similar in space (Khormi and Kumar, 2015). In this case, it is likely
that the association between health and climate and unobserved factors affecting both will cause spatial
dependency on the error term of the model (Anselin and Rey, 2014; Khormi and Kumar, 2015).

The main spatial econometric models for cross-sectional data are the Spatial Autoregressive Model
(SAR) and the Spatial Error Model (SEM). While the SAR model includes the spatially lagged depen-
dent variable as an independent variable, the SEM model includes the spatial dependence of unobserved
inﬂuences in the error term only. The most common criterion to choose between the two speciﬁcations is
the Robust Lagrange Multiplier (LM) statistics. If the LM statistics is signiﬁcant for both speciﬁcations,
Anselin and Rey (2014) suggest the use of the smaller value as the best model choice. This is the strategy
used here. Models for dengue, malaria, and leishmaniosis were based on SAR estimates, while circulatory,
respiratory, and infectious and parasitic diseases where modeled using the SEM speciﬁcation. The spa-
tial models were estimated in the GeoDaSpace software version 1.0 (GeoDa, 2016), using a Queen spatial
weight matrix of order 12.

Model 2: Impact of health on labor supply

The ﬁrst step to obtain the impact of health on labor supply due to climate change is to calculate counter-
factual rates of diseases. The rates are based on predicted values from our spatial regressions. For the SEM
model, predicted values are linear projections, as in a traditional OLS model. For the SAR models, the
predicted value of k-th health indicator for the m-th municipality is given by:

ln ˆΘk,m = (In − ˆρW )−1Xm

ˆβ

(2)
where In is a n × n identity matrix, n is the number of municipalities, ˆρ is the coefﬁcient for the spatially
lagged dependent variable, W is the Queen matrix for spatial weights, Xm is the matrix of covariates, and
ˆβ = (XmXm)−1Xm(In − ˆρW )lnΘk,m.

Although the models were directly estimated by the GeoDaSpace software, values for Eq.(2) had to be
estimated by a script developed by the authors in the R environment3 (R Core Team, 2016). These values
were exponentiated to get the predicted rates for the k-th morbidity. The predicted values of counter-factual
rates of diseases (Θcf
p,k,m) were calculated by replacing the climate parameters (based on the year 2005) for
their respective projections in 2010 and 20404, as deﬁned by the following equation:

2Two cases of islands were found among the 5,565 Brazilian municipalities. To avoid exclusion of these islands when using

Queen matrices for spatial weights, we imputed their weights based on the 4-nearest neighbors.

3The script is available upon authors’ request.
4We actually estimated all the results for quinquennial intervals. We decided to report results for 2010 and 2040 to avoid

cluttering the text with excessive information. Results are available upon authors’ request.

where ∆Ct,c,m = Ct,c,m−Cc,m for t = 2010, 2040. The ∆Ct,c,m represents the change in each of the climate
parameters (temperature, precipitation level and dispersion) between the t-th and the base years.

The incidence of persons affected by the k-th morbidity in the t-th year can be obtained by multiplying
the difference between the predicted prevalence rate at the base year and the counter-factual prevalence rate
in year t by the projected population in the same year (Pt,m)5. The formula is given by:

Eq.(4) provides the expected number of additional cases for the k-th morbidity in year t due to climate
change. These additional cases can be decomposed into deaths (permanent loss) and disability (temporary
loss) for the total population, using the following parameters from the Global Burden of Disease project:
Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) and its components (WHO, 2016). The DALY is the sum of the
years of life lost (YLL) due to premature death and the years lost due to disability (YLD). The YLL is the
product of the number of deaths and the life expectancy at the age of death. The YLD is the product of the
number of incident cases, the mean duration of disability, and the weight of disability (Leite et al., 2015).
These parameters are available by age, sex, country, and groups of morbidities, including the ones used in
this study. The most recent estimates provided by the project for Brazil corresponds to 2015.

The ﬁrst component of DALY (YLL) provides the permanent lives lost in the total population. In Eq.(5),
factor A represents the total number of deaths from the k-th morbidity among the total population for each
sex. Since we are interested in the labor loss only, this factor is weighted by the proportion of deaths
(D) among the working age population (π) due to the k-th morbidity for each sex (factor B). The outer
summation combines these permanent labor losses for each sex, given the ﬁnal permanent labor loss for the
working age population:

Data on mortality by age and sex was provided by the Latin American Human Mortality Database
(Urdinola and Queiroz, 2013). The most updated data refers to 2010, available for the following morbidity
groups used in this study: infectious and parasitic diseases, and diseases of the circulatory and respiratory
system. Since information for dengue, malaria, and leishmaniosis is not available, we assume that the age
proﬁle of deaths for these morbidities is the same as the one for the infectious and parasitic diseases. We
further assume that all age proﬁles of mortality by cause remain constant by 2040. The incidence parameter
(Γt,k,m) had to be aggregated at the state level due to lack of information by municipality6. This is why it is
represented in Eq.(5) as Γt,k,u.

The second component of DALY (YLD) provides the temporary years of life lost in the total population
In Eq.(6), factor A represents the total number of life years temporarily lost due to

due to disability.

5The population projections for 2010 and 2040 by municipality are updated ﬁgures based on the small-area estimations
provided by the Center for Development and Regional Planning at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (CEDEPLAR,
2014). Since some individuals would die due to climate change between 2005 and the t-th year, the population exposed to
reproduction changes. To incorporate this change in exposure, we recursively projected the population at each quinquennial time
interval, excluding individuals aged 15 to 49 years old who would die from climate-sensitive morbidities. This updating will
affect primarily the Γt,k,u parameter described in Eq.(4).

6This aggregation does not cause loss of information, because it is a sum of number of cases.

2.2.2 The impact of climate induced change in labor supply on the Brazilian economy

The last step in our methodological strategy is to estimate the regional economic impact of changes in the
labor supply due to climate change. To do that, we use the IMAGEM-B (Integrated Multi-regional Applied
General Equilibrium Model - Brazil). IMAGEM-B is a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of
multiple regions for Brazil. The model follows the basic theoretical structure of the TERM model - The
Enormous Regional Model - described in several other works (Horridge et al., 2005).

IMAGEM-B is a bottom-up CGE model that covers all 27 states in Brazil. Bottom-up models allow
the simulation of policies with region-speciﬁc price effects, such as when wage labor increases in speciﬁc
regions. They also allow us to model imperfect factor mobility between regions or between sectors. Thus,
increased labor demand in one region may be both choked off by a local wage rise and accommodated
by migration from other regions. Each regional CGE model is fairly conventional: producers choose a
cost-minimizing combination of intermediate and primary factor inputs, subject to production functions
structured by a series of constant elasticity of substitution (CES) “nesting” assumptions. Two high-level
aggregates, of primary factors and of intermediate inputs, are each demanded in proportion to the industry
output (Leontief assumption). The primary factor aggregate is a CES composite of capital, land, and a labor
aggregate. The aggregate intermediate input is again a CES composite of different composite commodities,
which are in turn CES composites of commodities from different sources (regions). Industry outputs are
transformed into commodity outputs via a constant elasticity of transformation (CET) mechanism. The
industries have constant-returns-to-scale technology and price at the marginal cost7.

Figure 5 illustrates the details of the IMAGEM-B system of demand sourcing for a single commodity
(Food) by a single user (Households) in a single region (Minas Gerais state). The diagram depicts a series
of ‘nests’, indicating the various substitution possibilities allowed by the model. The same diagram would
apply to other commodities, users, and regions. At the top level, households choose between imported (from
another country) and domestic food. A CES or Armington speciﬁcation describes their choice. Demands
are guided by user-speciﬁc purchasers’ prices with typical elasticity of substitution between domestic and
imported composites. Demands for domestic food in a region are summed over users to yield its total value.

7The use of increasing returns to scale in regional / structural CGE models is not a usual hypothesis, unlike the reduced
econometric models of the New Economic Geography. Theoretically, the introduction of this hypothesis into a general equilib-
rium model can cause problems of existence or multiplicity of equilibria (Mas-Colell et al., 1995). A parametric approach to
increasing returns in a regional CGE model for Brazil can be found in Haddad and Hewings (2005). In this work, however, only
8 economic sectors were speciﬁed and the return parameters were estimated in a cross-section for one Brazilian state. There
are currently no econometric estimates for returns to scale at the sectoral and regional level for Brazil, justifying the theoretical
and practical reasons for the hypothesis of constant returns used here. It can be considered at ﬁrst that the results obtained from
the simulations correspond to the lower results bound. Homogeneous returns in the regional sectors would tend to increase the
positive impacts and minimize the negative impacts due to the hypotheses of ﬁxed factors in the short or long term.

9

The usage matrix is measured in “delivered” values, which include basic values and margins (trade and
transport), but not the user-speciﬁc commodity taxes.

The second level treats the origin of the domestic compound across the various regions. A matrix shows
how this compound is divided among the source regions (Minas Gerais, S˜ao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro in
the example). Again, a CES speciﬁcation controls this allocation. The CES implies that regions with lower
production costs will tend to increase their market share. The sourcing decision is made on the basis of
delivered prices, which include transport and other margin costs. Hence, even with growers’ prices ﬁxed,
changes in transport costs will affect regional market shares. The variables at this level are not user speciﬁc,
since the decision is made on an all-user basis as if wholesalers, not ﬁnal users, decided where to source
food products. The implication for our example using Minas Gerais is that the proportion of food which
comes from S˜ao Paulo is the same for households, intermediate, and all other users. This feature is in
agreement with the database available for the Brazilian interstate trade, which does not specify the use of
ﬂows by destination state.

The next level down shows how a “delivered” food product from Rio de Janeiro is a Leontief composite
of basic food products and the various margin goods. The share of each margin in the delivered price is
speciﬁc to a particular combination of origin, destination, commodity, and source. For example, we should
expect transport costs to form a larger share for region pairs that are far apart, or for heavy or bulky goods.
Under the Leontief speciﬁcation we preclude substitution between Road and Retail Margins and incorporate
a CES speciﬁcation to accommodate Road/Rail switching.

The bottom part of the substitution hierarchy shows that margins on food passing from Rio de Janeiro to
Minas Gerais could be produced in different regions. The ﬁgure shows the sourcing mechanism for the road
and retail margins. We might expect this to be drawn more or less equally from the origin (Rio de Janeiro),
the destination (Minas Gerais), and regions in between. There would be some scope for substitution (elas-
ticity of ε = 0.5), since trucking ﬁrms can relocate depots to cheaper regions. For retail margins, on the
other hand, a larger share would be drawn from the destination region, yielding less scope for substitution
(ε = 0.1). Once again, this substitution decision takes place at an aggregated level, implying that the share
of, say, S˜ao Paulo, in providing Road margins on trips from Bahia to Santa Catarina is the same, whatever
good is being transported. Parallel system of sourcing is also modeled for imported food products, tracing
them back to port of entry instead of region of production.

The composition of household demand follows the linear expenditure system (LES). There is a set of
representative families8 in each region, consuming domestic goods (from the regions of the national econ-
omy) and imported goods. The treatment of household demand is based on a combined CES / Klein-Rubin
preference system. The demand equations are derived from a utility maximization problem whose solution
follows hierarchical steps. At the ﬁrst level there is CES substitution between domestic and imported goods.
At the subsequent level there is a Klein-Rubin aggregation of composite goods. Thus, utility derived from
consumption is maximized by this utility function. This speciﬁcation gives rise to the LES, in which the
share of expenditure above the subsistence level for each good represents a constant proportion of the total
subsistence expenditure of each household.

“Investors” are a category of use of the ﬁnal demand, responsible for the production of new units of cap-
ital. These investors choose the inputs through a process of minimization of costs, subject to a hierarchical
technology structure. As in production technology, capital goods are produced by domestic and imported
inputs. Exports from each region’s port to the world face a constant elasticity of demand. The standard
small country assumption is assumed, implying that Brazil is a price-taker in import markets. However,
because the imported goods are differentiated from the domestically produced goods, the two varieties are
aggregated using a CES function, based on the Armington assumption. Exports are linked to the demand
curves negatively associated with domestic production costs and positively affected by an exogenous ex-
pansion of international income. Government consumption is typically exogenous and can be associated or
not with household consumption or tax collection. Stocks accumulate, following the changes of production.
Our IMAGEM-B is a multi-period model with recursive-dynamic mechanisms. These mechanisms are:

(i) a stock-ﬂow relation between investment and capital stock, which assumes a one year gestation lag;
(ii) a positive relation between investment and the rate of proﬁt; and (iii) a relation between wage growth
and regional employment, implying that unemployment rates vary, at least in the short run. The model
is solved using the GEMPACK (Horridge et al., 2012), and contains a large database that tracks ﬂows of
interregional and international purchases of each commodity from each region of origin to each destination
region. IMAGEM-B database is based on the 2005 Brazilian National Input-Output tables, along with other
regional data sources. The database covers 55 sectors/products and the 27 Brazilian states. We use the
model to construct a base forecast for future states of the economy, to which different policy scenarios can
be compared. The new scenarios differ from the base only via shocks on labor force due to future climate
change, which generate deviations from the base. These deviations can be directly interpreted as the effect
of climate-induced change in labor supply through health on the main macroeconomic variables for the
Brazilian economy and its states: Gross Domestic Product (GDP), labor, and household consumption.

3 Results

Figures 6 and 7 present the results from the expected partial impact of climate change on disease preva-
lence (Figure 6), morbi-mortality, and labor supply (Figure 7) by region and disease groups. Prevalence
of circulatory diseases is expected to decline from 2005 to 2040 due to the projected increase in average
temperature across most municipalities in Brazil (Figure 7 - Panel B). Consequently, the morbi-mortality
rate from circulatory disease is expected to decline, yielding an increase in the labor supply by 2040. This
pattern holds for all the Brazilian regions, with higher impacts in the South. Different from the circula-
tory diseases, prevalence of respiratory disease is expected to increase marginally, with a small increase in
morbi-mortality and loss in the labor force across regions.

The impact of future climate change on vector borne and infectious diseases is higher in magnitude when
compared to the chronic conditions. Overall, prevalence of infectious diseases, and dengue is expected to
increase across all regions, resulting in higher morbi-mortality rates and signiﬁcant loss in the labor force
by 2040. Change in the prevalence of all three diseases will be higher in the North (ranging from 14%
for infectious diseases to 55% for dengue) and Center-West (ranging from 18% for infectious diseases to
68% for dengue). Despite the increase in the prevalence, rates themselves are low in magnitude (but high
if compared to other countries). Therefore, additional morbi-mortality and loss in the labor force due to
climate change would increase only marginally. Change in rates is the lowest for leishmaniosis.

Figures 8, 9, and 10 present the effect of climate change on employment, family consumption and
economic growth, respectively, by the Brazilian states when partial and indirect effects through the economy
are simultaneously considered (from the regional general equilibrium model). Different from the impacts
suggested by Figures 6 and 7, these include change in production costs due to climate-induce loss (gain) in
the labor supply. The regional impacts vary signiﬁcantly, and is different by group of diseases.

Figure 8 shows the regional variation in the cumulated percentage change in employment by 2050. For
the respiratory and circulatory disease, increase in unemployment due to the climate induced shocks on
the labor supply would be mostly concentrated in the Southeast and parts of the Northeast. South, Center-
West, and most of the North region would be beneﬁted with increase in employment rates because of the
expected increase in temperature, reducing the incidence of these chronic conditions. For the vector borne
and infectious diseases, higher losses in job creation would concentrate in the South, Center-West, and
North regions. Despite the large regional differences, the ﬁnal impact on employment would be modest,
and mostly due to change in the labor loss caused by the increased incidence of infectious and vector borne
diseases.

Figure 9 shows the regional variation in the accumulated percentage change in family consumption
by 2050. Different from employment, family consumption would stay virtually unaltered if the climate-
induced change in labor supply affected the economy only through the expected change in respiratory
and circulatory disease. This trend would hold for all states, with expected increase in consumption due

The expected change in economic performance of the Brazilian states is similar to the regional trend
found for employment (Figure 10). Growth in the regional GDP would be mostly due to expected labor
shocks from vector-borne and infectious diseases. The most affected states would be the ones in the Brazil-
ian agribusiness belt (Center-West), Bahia, and Amazonas. The South region would follow, with expected
decline in economic growth of around 2% to 3% by 2050.

4 Concluding Remarks

Global climate and environmental change have increased in the last decades. Increased health stress is one
of the most alarming consequences of these changes. Although many studies have tried to estimate the
direct and indirect consequences of a warmer and drier environment for the economy, both at a global and
local scale, a smaller number of studies have addressed the mid and long term health implications of these
changes at a regional level and as a dynamic process. Pattanayak et al. (2009) is one of the few exceptions,
although their model do not compute the climate impact on labor supply through morbidity and mortality
losses (gains) at a regional scale. Nor they recursively compute deaths due to climate in their population
projection estimates.

Building on their previous work, this study has taken a multi-stage approach to estimate the climate-
related consequences on cardiovascular/respiratory and infectious/vector-borne diseases, morbi/mortality,
and labor supply in Brazil. Combining Spatial Bayes Smoothing, Spatial Econometrics, Global Burden of
Disease data, and a Regional Computable General Equilibrium model, this study estimated the future devel-
opment of climate-sensitive health disorders, their implications for morbi-mortality, and the consequences
for labor supply and productivity for the Brazilian states and regions from 2010 to 2040.

We found a link between between climate change and health, although this relation varies by disease
and by region. The prevalence of circulatory diseases is expected to decline from 2005 to 2040 due to the
projected increase in average temperature across most municipalities in Brazil. Consequently, the morbi-
mortality rate from circulatory disease is expected to decline, yielding an increase in the labor supply by
2040. This effect is more pronounced in the South.

The impact of future climate change on vector borne and infectious diseases is higher in magnitude
when compared to the chronic conditions. Overall, prevalence of infectious diseases, wit large, and dengue
more speciﬁcally, is expected to increase across all regions, resulting in higher morbimortality rates and
signiﬁcant loss in the labor force by 2040. Change in the prevalence of all three diseases will be higher
in the North and in the Center-West. Despite the increase in the prevalence, rates themselves are low in
magnitude (but high if compared to other countries). Therefore, additional morbi-mortality and loss in the
labor force due to climate change would increase only marginally.

computed effect in the economy (from the computable regional general equilibrium model). The CGE result
shows that increased morbi-mortality and labor loss would be higher for vector-borne and infectious than
for non-communicable diseases, and mostly concentrated in less developed regions of the country.
