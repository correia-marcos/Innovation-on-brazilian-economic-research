RESUMO 
A  assistência  técnica  tem  sido  utilizada  como  instrumento  para  difundir  novas  tecnologias  entre  os 
estabelecimentos  agropecuários  por  meio  de  políticas  governamentais  como  a  Política  Nacional  de 
Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural (PNATER). Isto contribuído para incrementos de produtividade na 
agricultura nas últimas décadas. No entanto, o efeito da assistência técnica sobre a oferta de produtos e 
demanda  de  insumos  não  tem  sido  estudado  de  forma  mais  profunda.  Nós  abordamos  esta  questão 
estimando um sistema de equações baseado em uma função de lucro quadrática normalizada para obter o 
impacto da assistência técnica nas produções de milho, soja, café, cana de açúcar, leite, trigo e arroz, e nas 
demandas de combustíveis e trabalho contratado.  Nós estimamos oito equações de oferta e de demanda 
utilizando a abordagem dos Mínimos Quadrados em Três Estágios para dois conjuntos de dados – um em 
nível municipal e outro para fazendas representativas – com base no Censo Agropecuário de 2006. Nossos 
resultados sugerem um efeito positivo da assistência técnica governamental na produção de soja, milho e 
na demanda por combustíveis, enquanto que a assistência privada afetou positivamente as ofertas de soja 
e trigo,  e reduziu  a utilização de combustíveis  e trabalho  contratado. Além  disso, observou-se um salto 
maior na oferta de soja com um aumento da assistência técnica governamental do que com a assistência 
privada.  Nós  também  identificamos  que  o  efeito  da  assistência  técnica  privada  aumenta  a  oferta  das 
commodities de acordo com o tamanho do estabelecimento, o que não foi identificado para a assistência 
governamental.

ABSTRACT 
Technical assistance support has been used as an instrument to spread new technologies across farms in 
Brazil via governmental policies such as the National Policy on Technical Assistance and Rural Extension 
(PNATER). It has contributed to productivity enhancement on agriculture in the last decades.  However, 
the effect  of technical  assistance support on agricultural  output supply and input demands has not  been 
thoroughly  studied.  We  address  this  issue  by  estimating  a  system  of  equations  based  on  a  quadratic 
normalized restricted profit function to obtain the impact of technical assistance support on corn, soybean, 
coffee, sugarcane, milk, wheat and rice supplies, and fuel and hired labor demands. We estimated eight 
equations of supply and demand using an Iterated Three Stage Least Square for two sets of representative 
scale data –  a municipal scale and a farm representative– from the Brazilian Agricultural Census of 2006. 
Our results suggest a positive effect of governmental technical support on soybean and corn supply and 
fuel demand while the private support increases soybean and wheat supply and it saves on fuel and hired 
labor. In addition, a larger shift on soybean supply was observed --doubling the share of farms that receive 
governmental  support  over  private  support.  We  also  found  that  private  technical  support  effect  on 
commodities supply increases with farm size while the governmental support does not.

1.  Introduction 
 

Brazilian agriculture has been experiencing a strong productivity enhancement in the last decades related 
to technological change (Mendes et al. 2009, Bragagnolo et al. 2010, Helfand et al. 2015). Buainin et al. 
(2013)  asserts  that  the  Brazilian  agricultural  performance  is  based  on  research,  rural  credit  and  rural 
extension.  Several studies have studied the role of research and rural credit on agriculture (Gasques et al. 
2004,  Melo  et  al.  2015  and  Cardoso  et  al.  2012),  but  a  few  studies  have  investigated  the  relevance  of 
technical assistance and rural extension. Rodrigues (1997) and Peixoto (2014) highlight the relevance of 
the effects of such policy on agricultural performance and other socio-economic aspects. 

On  technical  assistance  support,  the  National  Policy  on  Technical  Assistance  and  Rural  Extension 
(PNATER)5 has been used to spread technical assistance support across the country in the last decades. 
Christoplos (2010) describes the former as a policy that seeks to make it possible for farms to obtain new 
technologies.  Additionally,  it  aims  to  teach  new  agricultural  techniques,  advise  on  price  analysis  and 
consult on farm management. PNATER, first implemented in 2003, added new goals to the former strategy 
(ATER6) including managerial tools on more sustainable agricultural techniques – a more sustainable use 
of natural resources (Ministry of Agrarian Development – MDA, 2016).  

Pettan  (2010)  and  Peixoto  (2009)  highlight  the  increase  on  non-governmental  institutions  after  the 
introduction  of  PNATER.  In  2006,  more  than  40%  of  the  technical  assistance  was  provided  by  non-
governmental institutions (private) (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics – IBGE, 2016). Both 
research  papers  assert  that  private  technical  assistance  support  increased  due  to  the  restructuring  of  the 
governmental ATER service, which it was scarce among small farms. It is worth to notice that although 
private support lead to productivity and farm income enhancement it is still not affordable by all farms. 
Thus, the aim of the PNATER is to meet the needs of these farms which cannot afford private support. A 
larger participation of other than governmental institutions have been observed and also increased monetary 
resources  with  the  introduction  of  PNATER,  from  R$  3  million  in  2001/2002  to  R$  109  million  in 
2006/2007. However, only 22% of farms had access to any technical assistance on 2006, which were mainly 
medium/large farms (IBGE, 2016). 

Several papers have analyzed Brazilian agriculture but without focusing on the relevance of technical 
assistance support on its performance7. Overall, a positive effect  of technical  assistance on productivity 
and/or production has been found (Moura et al. 2000, Freitas et al. 2014, and Helfand and Levine 2004).8 
In this paper, we address this issue directly seeking to evaluate the effect of technical assistance support on 
agricultural  output  supplies  and  input  demands.  In  addition,  we  seek  to  investigate  the  impact  of  both 
private and governmental technical assistance support. We are not aware of any other paper that analyzed 
specifically the effect of technical assistance on Brazilian Agriculture performance using this approach.  

Our research focuses on the major agricultural commodities and inputs to estimate a system of equation 
based  on  the  derivative  properties  of  a  quadratic  normalized  restricted  profit  function.  We  use  data  ata 
municipal scale and at farm level (a representative farm of differing sizes) from the Brazilian Agricultural 
Census of 2006. Specifically, we estimate a system of equations using Iterated Three Stage Least Square, 
which includes seven commodity supplies and two input demands to evaluate the impact of governmental 
and private technical assistance support as supply and demand shift. Our results have shown that technical 
assistance support positively impacts soybean, corn and wheat supplies and fuel and hired labor demands. 
For instance, on average, an increase of 10% on the share of farms that received governmental technical 
assistance support results in an increase of 16% of soybean supply while an increase on private support 
results in only 5.4%.  

The  remainder  of  this  study  is  divided  in  five  sections,  section  2  presents  a  brief  description  of  the 
background  on  technical  assistance  support  in  the  Brazilian  agricultural  sector.  Section  3  illustrates  the

Extensão rural).

7 On an international perspective, several papers have analyzed technical assistance for different countries using of production 
and cost functions (Birkhauser et al. 1991, Oehmke et al. 1997, Van Rijn et al. 2015).

4. Section 5 discusses the results and section 6 is the conclusion.  
 
2.  Background 
 

Bergamasco (1983) indicates that technical assistance support has been occurring a long time in the 
Brazilian  agriculture,  since  century  XIX,  but  Pettan  (2010)  argues  that  most  of  it  was  realized  by  non-
governmental institutions (private) and aimed to broadcast new techniques (in-farm training). Bergamasco 
(1983) also asserts that this type of technical assistance support took place until the late 1940’s when ATER 
started  to  being  formed,  known  as  Technical  Assistance  and  Rural  Extension.  She  also  highlights  its 
positive effect on socio-economic (and income) aspects, which it was based on U.S. system. 

However,  Alves  (2013)  suggests  a  bias  on  ATER  support  toward  larger  farms  and  more  developed 
agricultural  regions.  Figure  1  illustrates  regional  disparities  o  technical  assistance  support  across  the 
country. Municipalities on the south and southeast region have higher share of farms which have received 
any technical assistance support. Kageyama (1990) also states that family own-farms have been suppressed 
of ATER services.  

The National Policy on Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (PNATER) was created in 2003 by 
the Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA). Peixoto (2009) argues that the National Policy on Family 
Own-Farm (PRONAF), established in 1996, represented a seed to the PNATER establishment. PNATER 
was  structured  as  decentralized  ATER  service  system,  where  non-governmental  institutions  would 
participate actively (Peixoto 2009). Its implementation introduced raised more resources to ATER services, 
from R$ 3 million on 2001/2002 crop season to R$ 626 million on 2009/2010 crop season. Soares (2007) 
indicates  that  family  own-farms  gained  more  attention  under  this  new  system,  where  this  category 
experienced an increase of 35% on ATER services received during the period 2002-2007.

There  is  a  vast  international  literature  that  investigates  the  outcome  of  ATER  policies.  The  major 
assertion of these studies is the positive effect of this support on new technology propagation. Christoplos 
(2010) also suggested the broadcast information an important effect of these policies. Anderson and Feder 
(2004)  identified  its  high  impact  on  farm  productivity  and  income  enhancement  mainly  in  developing 
countries while Landini (2016) highlights its influence on organization of farmers.

Shakya and Flinn (1985) found that rice farms in Nepal that received technical assistance support had 
shown a higher likelihood of adopting a new technology. They measured technical assistance support as 
yearly number of attending visits  to the farm and new technology adoption as use of fertilizer and new 
varieties in rice. On the other hand, Gautam (2000) found a non-significant effect of rural extension on 
productivity9 enhancement in farms on Kenia. The major conclusion is that the ATER policy has limited 
range given it has positive effect only on less productivity farms. Jim and Huffman (2016) have found a 
positive and strong impact of rural extension on total factor productivity (TFP) for the 48 U.S. states during 
the period 1970-2004. A smaller effect but still positive was found for public investment on agricultural 
research. 

There are a few recent studies that have investigated directly technical assistance support for Brazilian 
agriculture.  Several  of  them  examine  technical  assistance  effect  only  on  farm  efficiency  such  as 
inGonçalves et al. (2008), Helfand and Levine (2004) and Freitas et al. (2014). Overall, they have found a 
positive effect. The former found a stronger effect on larger farms and non-significant effect on small farms. 
Pereira  et  al.  (2010)  address  this  issue  differently.  They  sought  to  investigate  the  determinants  of  post-
harvest technologies on coffee production in a Southern Brazilian state, Minas Gerais. They have found a 
positive  impact  of  technical  assistant  support  (measured  as  employee  training)  on  adoption  of  new 
technology, although monetary return, farmer characteristics and being in a cooperative had played a more 
relevant role.  
 
3.  Theoretical framework 
 

There  is  a  widespread  literature  on  output  supply  and  input  demand  shift  influenced  by  quasi-fixed 
factors  from  a  restricted  profit  function  (Diewert,  1974;  Lau,  1976;  Diewert,  1971).  The  latter  function 
represents the profit in the short run where some of the inputs have little or zero mobility during a short 
period, which implies time and cost to adjust (Huffman and Evenson, 1989), named quasi-fixed inputs. In 
this paper, we modeled technical  assistance as a quasi-fixed input in a restricted profit function since it 
affects commodity production as an input but it is not flexible (i.e. labor). Several papers have used this 
approach  to  evaluate  public  policies  and  research  and  development  impacts  such  as  Shumway  (1983), 
Huffman and Evenson (1989) and Fulginiti; Perrin, 1990. As mentioned before, this approach will permit 
to evaluate the impact for being assisted on commodities supply and input demands. 

According with Lau (1976), a multi-output and multi-input production can be represented considering 
𝑦𝑖, 𝑖 = 0, 1, … , 𝑛 + 𝑚, as vector of inputs and outputs. A numeraire output is represented by 𝑦0, outputs by 
𝑦𝑖 > 0  ,  𝑖 = 0, 1, … , 𝑛,  where  𝑛  represents  outputs,  and  for  𝑚  inputs  𝑦𝑖 < 0,  𝑖 = 𝑛 + 1, … , 𝑛 + 𝑚.  The 
quasi-fixed factors such technical assistance are represented by 𝑧𝑘, where 𝑧𝑘 ≥ 0, 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝐾.  

The transformation curve associated to the multi-output and multi-input described is a function of all 
these variables  𝐹(𝑦0, 𝑦1, … , 𝑦𝑛, 𝑦𝑛+1, … , 𝑦𝑛+𝑚; 𝑧1, … , 𝑧𝐾) = 0. Under perfect  competition  on output and 
input  markets  and  a  technology  that  satisfy  monotonicity  and  convexity,  a  normalized  restricted  profit 
function is  𝜋 = 𝐹(𝑝1, … , 𝑝𝑛, 𝑝𝑛+1, … , 𝑝𝑛+𝑚; 𝑧1, … , 𝑧𝐾) where 𝑝𝑖 = 𝑃𝑖 𝑃0⁄ ,  𝑃0 represents  the price of the 
numeraire output 𝑦0, and 𝑃𝑖 is the nominal price of each other input and output 𝑦𝑖, 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛 + 𝑚.  

 

 

𝜋 = 𝐹(𝑝, 𝑧) 

(1) 

where 𝜋 is the normalized restricted profit (𝜋 = 𝜋′/𝑃0), where 𝜋′ is the nominal profit), 𝑝 is a vector of 
𝑛 + 𝑚  normalized  prices,  and  𝑧  is  a  vector  of  𝐾  quasi-fixed  inputs.  The  normalized  restricted  profit 
function is homogeneous of degree one with respect to prices (which is imposed by dividing by one of the 
prices),  non-decreasing  in  output  prices  and  non-increasing  in  input  prices  (monotonicity  in  inputs  and 
outputs), symmetric (which is  also imposed in the estimation), and is  convexity in  prices (second  order 
derivatives matrix is positive semidefinite).  

                                                 
9Two components were considering within the productivity effect estimation – efficiency and technical – using two different 
non-parametric methodologies (Data Envelopment Analysis and Malmquist Index)

We assume that all farms are profit maximizers on a perfect competition structure, so the supply curve 
and input demand can be recover by envelope theorem using the first derivative (which by the monotonicity 
property will have the following sign)

4.1.Data 

 

We use the Agricultural Census of 2006 made available by IBGE. At first, we use municipal data scale 
to achieve our objective. Our data set initially is formed by 5.548 observations but as noted in previous 
studies,  such  as  Helfand  et  al.  (2015),  outliers  affect  heavily  the  estimation.  Thus,  we  dropped  all 
observations  with  normalized  prices  higher  than  its  mean  added  by  one  and  a  half  standard  deviation, 
leading  to  a  total  of  4.678  observations  that  will  be  used.  Table  1  displays  descriptive  statistics  of  the 
variables considered in our model for this set of observations. For example, the mean coffee price changes 
from R$ 890 to R$ 758 after controlling to outliers. In the extension part we use representative farm scale10 
to estimate the effect ATER on agricultural commodity supplies and input demands. In a later section we 
describe this procedure.  

We chose the outputs based on its monetary relevance on total agricultural production in each region, 
such as in Huffman e Evenson (1989) and Figueiredo e Teixeira (2002). Output quantities of soybean, corn, 
sugarcane, coffee, rice, wheat and milk are in tons, while the output prices were obtained by the ratio of 
production  value  and  production  output,  such  as  in  Pereda  (2012)  and  Figueiredo  (2002).  Figure  2,  in 
Appendix C, shows the distribution of some of this outputs across the country. Some products are produced 
regionally such as soybean, wheat and sugarcane while other are spread across the country such as corn. 
Some states are well known as agricultural producers such as Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, and have shown 
high level of production in different outputs.

for providing us this dataset.

In the input side we chose two factors as variable inputs, hired labor and fuel. For the former, input 
price was calculated as the ratio of labor expenses by its quantity while for the latter was by the ratio of 
fuel  expenses by its quantity. We decided for using fuel  as variable input to  capture a measure of farm 
capital use, as argued by Burniaux and Truong (2002) and Pereda (2012).

Technical  assistance  support  is  a  quasi-fixed  input  represented  in  two  variables,  governmental  and 
private  technical  assistance  support.  Around  14%  of  farms  in  each  municipality  received  governmental 
technical assistance support, while only 4% received any private support. As shown in Figure 1, the latter 
support is mainly concentrated on the south and southeast regions. Also in Figure 1, it is worth to notice 
how spread is  the  governmental  technical  assistance support is,  although  with  lower attainment  in each 
municipality. We also add irrigated area as a quasi-fixed.    
 

4.2.Empirical estimation 

 

Several  papers  have  used  the  restricted  profit  function  when  facing  a  multi-input  and  multi-output 
technology such as Shumway (1983), Shumway et al. (1988), Huffman and Evenson (1989) and Schuring 
et  al.  (2011).  For  more  details  about  this  approach  see  Lau  (1976)  and  Nadiri  (1982).  Three  functional

forms  are  usually  used  for  restricted  profit  functions:  transcendental  logarithm  (translog),  quadratic 
normalized and generalized Leontief11. Chambers et al. (2013) indicated that the quadratic normalized is 
superior than the other using a Monte Carlo simulation. Therefore, we use a quadratic normalized restricted 
profit function to represent the Brazilian farms, represented in its matrix form, as described in  Fulginiti 
(2010)

where input price (𝑝0 – hired labor) was used as the normalizing price for variable profit and inputs;  𝑝𝑖 
represents prices of n outputs and m inputs, i = n+m outputs and inputs (netputs) and 𝑧𝑘 represents  the 
quasi-fixed inputs. The restricted profit function was modeled using soybean, milk, sugarcane, corn, coffee, 
rice and wheat as outputs, labor and fuel as variable inputs, and public and private technical assistance, 
irrigated  area  and  a  dummy  identifying  farms  in  Brazilian  South  and  Southeast  regions  as  quasi-fixed 
inputs. Parameter 𝛼0 is an estimated constant, 𝛼′ is a row vector (1x8) of estimated parameters for the linear 
variables and 𝛽 is a matrix (8x8) of estimated parameters for the interactions between normalized input 
and quasi-fixed inputs quantities 

The normalized restricted profit represented in equation (6) is homogenous of degree one in prices and 
was used to obtain the commodity supply and input demand, represented by equations (2a) and (2b) on the 
theoretical framework, which can now be represented as

where the first equation represents supply and the second input demand (which by Hotteling lemma has a

A system of eight equations, considering seven outputs – soybean, milk, sugarcane, corn, coffee, rice 
and wheat – and fuel as variable input, represented in equations (7a) and (7b), respectively, were estimated 
using an Iterated Three Stage Least Square (3SLS). The hired labor was used as a normalizer price on the 
estimation and its demand can be recover using the homogeneity property represented by equation (3) on 
the theoretical framework

where this equation can take any sign12. 

Symmetry and homogeneity were imposed on the estimation but monotonicity (sign of the  equations 
(7a) and (7b) that represent supply and demand) was not and it was checked in the results. Monotonicity, 
in special, has an important effect on the elasticity calculation. The elasticities standard errors were obtained 
using Delta method13. All procedures were done using Stata 14, with the code reg3. 
 
5.  Results and discussion 
 

A system of equation was estimated using Iterated 3SLS considering seven supplies (corn, soy, milk, 
coffee, sugar, rice and wheat) and one input demand (fuel). Hired labor price was used as normalizer price 
and was estimated after  using of the symmetry  property. Overall14, the  estimation  presented a  good fit. 
Most of the coefficients were statistically significant (around 67% of the coefficients were significant at 
10%),  monotonicity15  was  satisfied  in  at  least  90%  of  the  observations  within  outputs/inputs  directly 
estimated in the system of equation. Table 2 displays the results in the Appendix B. 

Most of the elasticities have presented a correct theoretical sign. The own-price elasticities and cross-
price  elasticities  are  displayed  in  Table  3.  All  own  price  elasticities  are  correctly  signed,  where  output 
supply  shows  a  positive  elasticity  and  input  demand  a  negative  sign,  except  the  own  elasticity  for 
sugarcane16. Own price elasticity for all outputs and input demand of fuel and hired labor are statistical 
significant. Rice, corn and coffee was the output with larger price-effect compare to the other outputs – an 
increase of 10% on its price would lead to an increase on supply of these products by 34%, 6.7% and 4.3%, 
respectively.  Castro (2008) when estimating  a profit function for  Brazil (not  per municipality, which is 
more aggregated) found a significant own-price elasticity for rice and corn of 0.43 and 0.21. On the other 
hand, soybean and corn have shown to be inelastic. 

Both  inputs  have  shown  to  be  elastic.  However  previous  studies  such  as  Figueiredo  (2002)  haven’t 
found a  consistent result for input elasticities either.  It  is  worth  to  notice  that an increase in  fuel  prices 
would  lead  to  a  decrease  in  supply  of  agricultural  commodities.  Wheat  and  rice  are  the  outputs  more 
sensitive to changes in input prices. We have found that wages (hired labor prices) have an expected sign 
on soybean and milk, but not in the other outputs such as in Figueiredo (2002) and Castro (2008). Fuel and 
labor are substitutes, given the positive sign on their cross-elasticity. Additionally, soybean and corn supply 
are substitute given that both outputs are used on animal feed. In addition, as expected, milk and corn are 
complements given that corn is used as cattle feed.   

Irrigated area was statistically significant for all commodities supply and input demands. A positive 
effect of the latter was found in the output supplies, with a larger effect on corn, rice and soybean. Our 
dummy variable identifying municipalities in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil (more agricultural 
developed  regions)  was  statistically  positive  on  sugarcane,  coffee  and  wheat  supply  but  negative  for 
soybean supply. This outcome is related to the geographical distribution of their production, as you can see 
in Figure C1, in appendix C. Soybean production is also largely produced in the Midwest region.

13 More details about this method cf.Seber (1973). 
14Breusch-Pagan test indicated 3SLS estimation over separately Ordinary Least Square (OLS) equations estimation. 
15 Monotonicity property was satisfied in most of observation for the outputs and inputs:  corn (98%), soy (80%), milk (98%), 
coffee (64%), sugar (88%), rice (33%), wheat (72%) and fuel (97%). 
16 However, we did not find a negative elasticity for sugarcane when we estimate the system of equations using the data set at 
farm scale.

5.1.Policy implication 

 

We estimated the supply and input elasticities with respect to the quasi-fixed inputs to evaluate the impact 
of technical assistance support on agriculture. Table 4 reports them. An increase of 10% on the governmental 
support leads to a statistical increase of around 16% on soybean supply and an increase of 3% and 4.6% on 
corn supply and fuel demand, respectively. Interestingly, we found a significant and negative effect of this 
type of support on milk  supply, although Campos (2011) has  also  found a negative effect of governmental 
technical assistance support on dairy farm efficiency.

Private technical assistance support has impacted positively and significantly soybean and wheat supplies, 
while negatively sugarcane supply and fuel demand. On average, an increase of 10% on the number of farms 
that received private technical assistance support would lead to an increase of 5.4% and 8.4% on soybean and 
wheat supply, respectively. Private technical assistance support is fuel and labor saver. We conclude based on 
these results that private technical assistance support is more effective than the governmental support given 
that is cost reducer.  

We have found a much higher impact of technical assistance support than Evenson, Cruz and Avila (1988), 
which found that an increase of 10% on this support would lead to an increase of 0.2% on corn supply and 
0.7%  on  livestock  products  supply.  However,  they  haven’t  disaggregated  technical  assistance  support  in 
governmental and private, used similar framework and neither considered more agricultural commodities. 

Figure 2 illustrates how the supply of soybean shifts right (increases) with a higher technical assistance 
support,  independently  whether  governmental  or  private,  as  Table  4  shows.  We  considered  the  median 
technical assistance support to build these curves, for the gov. support it is 0.086 while for private is 0.0172. 
In both graphs the curve S0 represent the same level (holding all the other variables at their median) while S1 
represents the same level but doubling technical assistance (i.e. 0.086 x 2 = 0.172 for governmental technical 
assistance support). It clearly shows a large effect of technical assistance and it highlights the relevance of 
governmental policies toward technical assistance support enhancement.  

Alves  (2013)  and  Kageyama  (1990)  highlights  a  higher  access  of  larger  farms  to  technical  assistance 
support, which might be correlated to farmers’ access to rural credit. Plata and Fernandes (2011) pointed out 
that the average farm size that received any technical assistance support was of 228 hectares while the farmers’ 
that did not received had an average farm of 42 hectares. It clearly shows a bias on the distribution of technical 
assistance support. 

As  mentioned  in  previous  section  technical  assistant  support  has  been  bias  toward  larger  farms,  under 
attending to small farms. Thus, we also estimated the system of equations considering four different farm sizes: 
zero to ten hectares, ten to 100 hectares, hundred to thousand hectares and larger than thousand hectares. We 
constructed  representative  farms  per  size  by  dividing  the  output  by  the  number  of  farms  in  each  of  the 
categories in addition to including farm size dummies. This procedure is well used in the literature such as in 
Helfand et al. (2015). Here, we present only the results of technical assistance support by farm size (table 5).

Figure 2: Impact of an increase on governmental and private technical assistance support on soybean supply 
Note: Soybean supply is the predicted estimated soybean supply equation. Normalized soybean price is the price of soybean divided 
by the wage (labor price). S0 is the soybean supply considering the median of all other prices and quasi-fixed inputs (see Table 2 in 
Appendix B). S1 is the soybean supply holding all other prices and quasi-fixed inputs equal to S0 but the technical assistance support 
where the median is multiplied by two.  
Source: Own elaboration.  

 
Table 5 shows that governmental technical assistance support has a higher impact within small suppliers 
of soybean, milk and corn while for other outputs its effect does not differ across farm sizes. However, private 
technical assistance support has a higher effect on most of output supply on larger farm sizes but milk supply. 
This outcome was expected given that small farms cannot afford this expenses, relying more on governmental 
technical assistance support. Interestingly, technical assistance support is less fuel demand saver as farm size 
increases, which might be related to modernization of farm production since larger farms have higher access 
to credit and, thus, they are more capital intensive.

In short, our preliminary results suggest that a system of Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (ATER) 
that includes both governmental and private support, as proposed by the PNATER, is more effective given its 
complementarity impact on agriculture. It corroborates what was suggested by Peixoto (2014). Governmental

6.  Conclusions 
 

In this paper, we seek to evaluate  the impact of the National Policy on Technical Assistance and Rural 
Extension (PNATER) as well as the overall technical assistance support, which also includes private support. 
We estimated a system of agricultural supplies and input demands based on a restricted normalized quadratic 
profit function at municipal and farm (representative) scale. Overall, our preliminary results are robust with 
theoretical properties and could be used as guidance on policy design. 

We have found that governmental technical assistance support affects positively soybean and corn supply 
while private support drives the supply of soybean and wheat up. As expected, private support has a higher 
effect on commodities supply on larger farms while governmental support has on smaller farms, with some 
exceptions. A higher investment on ATER accompanied by decentralization of it and association with different 
institutions, including private, would lead to an increase of farm income via higher output supply and input 
saver.   

This is on-going research where valuable and reliable results have been found in a first step. In the nearby 
future we will be estimating this framework on a farm level scale available on the Agricultural Census of 2006, 
at IBGE. A more rigorous and robust analysis will be achieved and better policy resolutions could be drawn 
from it.

where for outputs have to be positive reflecting the positive slope of a supply curve, and for an input it has to 
be negative reflecting the negative slope of a demand. The sign of these elasticities are based on the second 
order derivatives matrix (Hessian) or convexity of the restricted profit function. The cross-price elasticity (or 
the effect of a change in input price on output supply or vice-versa) can be found by

where equation (A.3a) represents  own-price elasticity, equation (A.3b) and (A.3c) the cross-price elasticity 
between non-normalized output and normalized output. As previously assigned, we expect a negative sign of 
the own-price elasticity since it is an input demand.
