The  Programa  de  Sustentação  do  Investimento  (BNDES  PSI)  was  structured  by  the 
Brazilian Government at 2009, with the explicit aim of stopping the aggregate investment 
plummet,  observed  at  the  first  semester  of  that  year.  With  an  expressive  budget,  this 
program  has  recently  received  much  attention  in  the  Brazilian  economic  debate,  with 
several  authors  questioning  its  capacity  to  burst  investments,  since  the  GFCF  has  not 
recovered its pre-crisis level. Using information available at the firm level, this paper aims 
to contribute to the debate by evaluating the impact of PSI on the investment level of firms 
– focusing in the industrial sector. The identification strategy adopted for this purpose was 
based on two complementary matching estimators: the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) 
and  the  Conditional  Differences-in-Differences  Matching  (DIDM).  The  data  used  came 
from  the  Industrial  Survey  (PIA)  of  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics 
(IBGE) on economic activities of Industrial firms for the 2007-2010 period and from the 
BNDES’ records on Industrial firms receiving PSI financing in the 2009-2010 period. The 
empirical  results  showed  a  positive  impact  of  PSI  on  the  firms’  investment  level,  even 
though its magnitude declined in between 2009 and 2010.

Introduction  

Since  July  2009,  PSI  has  offered  financial  incentives  to  the  acquisition  of  capital  goods, 
with conditions that vary, among other factors, according to aggregate investment trends in 
the Brazilian economy.  In general, the PSI can be understood as a reduction in the final 
price  of  domestic  capital  goods  (price  of  the  goods  added  to  the  financing  cost),  which 
represents an incentive for Brazilian companies to allocate more resources for investment.  

Due to its large-scale allocation budget and its rather low interest rate on financing, the PSI 
has come under question in relation to its capacity to influence investment in the country, 
within  a  context  in  which  the  Gross  Fixed  Capital  Formation  (GFCF)  of  the  Brazilian 
economy has not recovered to the levels recorded before the financing crisis. Therefore, it 
seems natural that current Brazilian economic debate should focus on the cost-benefit ratio 
of the program. 

Due  to  the  classic  problem  of  selection  that  hampers  the  impact  evaluation  of  public 
policies, widely discussed in Heckman et al (1997, 1998), it is not a simple task to identify 
to what extent the PSI stimulus has effectively been converted into investment. To evaluate 
PSI effects on industrial companies’ investments, widely used matching estimators, such as 
Propensity  Score  Matching  and  Conditional  Difference-in-Difference  Matching,  were 
applied.  Such  methods  allowed  the  comparison  of  companies  receiving  PSI  support  with 
those  that  did  not.  The  database  used  in  this  evaluation  were:  i)  the  IBGE’s  Industrial 
Survey (PIA) from 2007 to 2010; and ii) information on financing offered within the scope 
of the BNDES PSI (1st phase) from 2009 to 2010. 

Results show a positive and significant impact of the PSI on the level of investment in the 
companies in 2009 and 2010. That is, in the absence of the program, the Brazilian industrial 
segment  would  have  invested  less.  However,  we  observed  a  reduction  of  the  estimated 
effect at 2010, when compared with 2009. This robust result was achieved through several 
specifications of the applied methods, based on a progressive control of the selection bias.  

The  paper  is  structured  in  five  sections,  besides  this  introduction.  The  Program  section 
contextualizes and describes the PSI in its first  phase. The  Strategy  Identification section 
presents  the  econometric  approach  used  to  estimate  the  impact  of  the  program.    In  the 
Database  section,  the  sources  of  researched  information  are  presented,  as  well  as  the 
descriptive statistics of the basis used. The results of the estimated models are presented in 
the  Results  section  and  the  Final  Considerations  section  discusses  the  main  findings  and 
implications of the results found. 

The Program 

To  understand  the  goals  of  PSI,  it  is  necessary  to  assess  the  context  for  its  creation. 
Between  the  3Q08  and  the  1Q09,  the  GFCF  fell  approximately  20%  in  nominal  terms3, 
after  the  international  financial  crisis  reached  the  Brazilian  economy.  In  late  June  2009, 
after  a  timid  recovery,  investment  remained  at  a  much  lower  level  than  that  recorded 
immediately prior to the crisis.

It  was  in  this  scenario  that  the  BNDES’  PSI  was  launched,  in  July  2009.  With  an  initial 
allocation budget of R$ 40.1 billion, the program consisted fundamentally of a change to 
the  then-existing  financing  conditions  for  BNDES  Finame,  targeted  at  stimulate  the 
acquisition  and  production  of  capital  goods  manufactured  in  Brazil.  The  goal  was  to 
employ  more  favorable  financing  conditions  to  reverse  the  investment  decline  that  had 
occurred. 

Table 1 summarizes the financing conditions for operations using the BNDES PSI between 
July 2009 and June 2010, a period in which Phase 1 of the program remained in effect. For 
comparison, it is worth recalling that BNDES Finame’s traditional financing conditions for 
machinery and equipment established a financial cost comprising the long-term interest rate 
(TJLP - then at 6.25% p.a.), a spread for the BNDES of 0.9 % p.a., and a spread negotiated 
directly between the end customer and the financial agent of the operation.

In practice, this new set of conditions meant a substantial reduction in the interest rate for 
financing  to  purchase  machinery  and  equipment,  while  eliminating,  for  the  buyer,  the 
uncertainty regarding the final financial cost of the operation by introducing a fixed interest 
rate.

Chart 2 compares the distribution of the final average interest rates for operations in the PSI 
(Phase  1)  and  BNDES  Finame,  while  Chart  3  makes  the  same  comparison  of  the 
distribution  of  the  total  term  of  the  loan.  It  is  possible  to  note  that  the  final  interest  rate 
median dropped from approximately 10% p.a. in Finame loans to 4.5% p.a.  in PSI . It is 
also  possible  to  note  that  the  distribution  of  loan  terms  is  denser  in  PSI  loans  with  more 
than 100 months than in Finame loans with the same loan term. 

That is, BNDES PSI, from a theoretical point of view, can be understood as a reduction in 
the final price of capital goods (price of the good plus the cost of financing), which should 
work  as  an  incentive  for  Brazilian  companies  to  allocate  more  resources  for  investment. 
Therefore, the program’s incentive mechanisms were operating at a microeconomic level, 
regardless of their motivation stemming from the macroeconomic context of the Brazilian 
economy.

that 

the  Brazilian  companies  considered 

Chart  4  suggests 
that  program’s  most 
advantageous  financial  conditions  were  attractive,  given  the  increase  of  the  demand  for 
BNDES’  disbursements.  However,  the  question  this  paper  tries  to  face  is:  to  what  extent 
was this additional demand for funds from the BNDES effectively associated with a change 
in investment decisions of Brazilian companies? 

The  behavior  noted  in  the  aggregate  investment  level  (Chart  1)  does  not  support  an 
appropriate  answer  to  this  question.  After  all,  there  are  several  factors  affecting  the 
behavior of the Brazilian GFCF, such as the exchange rate, business expectations, changes 
to  regulation  etc.  It  is  not  reasonable  to  evaluate  the  results  of  PSI  based  solely  at  the 
behavior of macroeconomic series - which consolidate not only the impact of PSI, but a set 
of other economic variables. 

It is at the microeconomic level that BNDES PSI should be assessed. This means adopting 
an  empirical  strategy  that  enables  the  identification  of  whether  there  is  a  causality 
relationship  between  PSI  incentives  and  the  reaction  of  companies’  investments,  which 
would represent a breakthrough in discussions on the impact of the program.

Identification strategy 

While  discussing  methods  for  public  policy  evaluations,  Heckman  et  al  (1998,  p.264) 
concluded  that  the  main  difficulty  arises  fundamentally  from  a  lack  of  information, 

 

5 

originating  from  the  impossibility  of  observing  a  single  agent  in  two  different 
circumstances – treated and non-treated. In the words of the authors: 

“Each  person  can  be  in  one  of  two  possible  states,  0  and  1,  with  associated 
outcomes  (Y0,(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3),  corresponding  to  receiving  no  treatment  or  treatment 
respectively. (…) Let D=1 if a person is treated; D=0 otherwise. The gain from 
treatment is ∆ = Y1 - Y0. We do not know ∆ for anyone because we observe only 
Y=DY1 + (cid:4)1-D(cid:5)Y0, i.e. either Y0 or  Y1.”   

That is, it is not possible to compare the evolution of a company receiving PSI support with 
progress that the firm itself would have had with no access to the program. Any technique 
that  aims  to  estimate  the  impact  of  PSI  on  investment  decision  needs  to  extract  this 
information  by  comparing  a  group  that  had  access  to  the  program  with  another  group  of 
companies, containing only firms with no access. Besides, the access to PSI is the result of 
a process in which two important events take place: i) based on their innate characteristics, 
firms  choose to seek or not financing within the program; ii) commercial banks4, in their 
turn, select companies to which they grant credit, based on an analysis of credit risk and in 
compliance with the program’s legal and regulatory requirements. 
 
These two selection processes tend to produce a sample in which the differences between 
the groups of companies are correlated, at the same time, with the expected policy outcome 
and the probability of access to the policy instrument. Thus, there is a clear problem of bias 
in selection. 
 
To deal with this problem, this study used a traditional method at the evaluation literature: 
the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) originally proposed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983, 
1984). This method basically increases the degree of comparability between the treated and 
non-treated groups, ensuring that they comprise similar firms with regard to this propensity 
score,  i.e.  the  probability  of  taking  part  in  a  program  that  is  conditional  to  the  important 
features  for  access  (productivity,  size,  profitability,  etc.).  The  basic  assumption  in  this 
method  is  that  if  companies  are  "equal"  in  terms  of  this  probability,  then  the  difference 
noted in investment can be considered a result of the program.5  
 
Formally, consider a set of characteristics (cid:6) and one variable (cid:7) that defines the status of 
participation of  a particular firm in  PSI,  assuming  a value of 1 for  participants and 0 for 
other  firms.  It  is  then  possible  to  estimate  the  propensity  score  (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:3) (cid:11) (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:10) (cid:11) 1|(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:3), 
which  represents  the  probability  that  a  given  firm  i  will  take  part  in  PSI  at  t,  given  its 
characteristics in t-1, before accessing the program. 
 
By  initially  assuming  that  this  probability  depends  solely  on  the  characteristics  of 
companies  that  are  observable,  the  first  stage  of  the  PSM  method  is  to  obtain  (cid:14)̂(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:3)  an 
                                                            
4 PSI operates by means of indirect operations, in which commercial banks are responsible for the credit risk 
analysis.  
5  The  use  of  propensity  score  for  matching  was  motivated  by  the  work  by  Rosenbaum  and  Rubin  (1983, 
1984), which demonstrated the validity of the balancing property in the propensity score. The validity of this 
property  implies  that  if  the  propensity  score  is  known,  it  is  possible  to  use  it  as  a  substitute  for  the  set  of 
variables that condition participation when matching.

estimator of (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:10) (cid:11) 1|(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:3), which can be obtained by estimating a parametric model such as 
a logit or probit (more details in Blundell and Dias, 2009).  
 
Having obtained (cid:14)̂(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:3) for the sample of companies used6, the second step is to estimate the 
Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (ATT).7 This estimator is formally defined in [1] 
below: 

(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:20) (cid:11) ∑(cid:10)∈(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:10) (cid:26) ∑(cid:27)∈(cid:28)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:10)(cid:27)(cid:25)(cid:27)(cid:31)(cid:29)(cid:10)  [1] 

 
(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:20)  is  the  measure  of  impact  of  PSI  on  current  investments  of  treated  companies  ((cid:25)(cid:10)). 
Moreover,  T  and  C  represent  the  treatment  groups  and  control,  respectively,	(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:10)(cid:27)  is  the 
weight placed on the observation of comparison ! for the company " (calculated using the 
estimated  propensity  score)  and  (cid:29)(cid:10)  is  the  re-consideration  that  recovers  the  outcome 
variable for the treated sample. 8 
 
Following Blundell and Dias (2009), two identification hypotheses are essential to ensure 
the  consistency  of  the  estimates  in  this  method:  first,  it  is  assumed  that  there  is 
independence,  conditional  to  the  propensity  score,  between  the  results  of  the  untreated 
firms 	(cid:25)#and the status of treatment. This hypothesis can be formally defined as [2]: 

# $ (cid:7)(cid:10)|(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:6)"(cid:3) [2] 
(cid:25)(cid:10)

Moreover,  it  is  necessary  to  satisfy  the  common  support  assumption,  formally  defined  in 
[3] below. It is intuitive to note that if a particular group (cid:6)(cid:10) is associated with (cid:14)̂(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:3) (cid:11) 1, 
then  there  will  be  only  treated  companies  with  these  characteristics  and,  therefore,  you 
cannot obtain a group of firms that is comparable and has not used PSI resources. 
 

(cid:8)%(cid:7)(cid:10) (cid:11) 1|(cid:6)(cid:10)& ’ 1 [3] 

The  main  limitation  to  this  estimation  method,  however,  is  that  it  deals  solely  with  the 
selection bias related to observable variables. For this reason, this paper employed a second 
identification  strategy,  initially  proposed  by  Heckman  et  al  (1997),  which  combines  the 
method of Difference-in-Differences (DID), widely used in the evaluation literature, with 
the  PSM  (referred  to  as  the  Conditional  Difference-in-Differences  Matching  -  DIDM 
hereinafter). The DIDM can be understood as a variation of PSM, which may be applied 
when there is longitudinal data available for treated and controls groups. 
 

                                                            
6 Implementing the method requires specification of the estimated model of the propensity score to satisfy the 
balancing property of the sample. This verification is based on a test t of average differences between groups 
receiving  support  and  those  not  receiving  support,  for  each  of  the  co-varieties  in  the  model,  the  sampling 
strata defined based on the distribution of (cid:14)̂(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:3). For details, see Becker and Ichino (2002). 
7 The term treated comes from the initial application of this technique, which aimed to identify the effect of 
medical treatments by comparing the performance of treated patients (called the treatment group) with that of 
the untreated group (called the control group). In our case, access to PSI resources can be considered a kind of 
"treatment". 
8 The literature uses different methods to calculate these weights based on individual estimated probabilities 
of participation in the program. Notable techniques include "Nearest Neighbour", Kernel and Stratification. 

7 

 

Intuitively, this estimator compares the evolution of the results of treated companies with 
untreated  firms  throughout  the  observation  period  (before  and  after  treatment)  and 
attributes  any  difference  in  evolution  to  the  impact  of  the  treatment.  This  identification 
strategy is quite interesting for evaluate PSI, since literature has shown it is capable of deal 
with selection bias, caused by unobservable variables (provided they are time invariant). 
 
Formally,  the  identification  hypothesis  the  method  assumes  is  that,  conditional  to  the 
observable factors	(cid:6), development of the unobservable part (cid:25)# between the periods before 
and after the treatment is independent from the status of treatment: 

(cid:9)((cid:10)) (cid:26) ((cid:10),)+(cid:2)(cid:3) $ (cid:7)(cid:10))|(cid:6)(cid:10) [4] 

Additionally, it is necessary to impose the common support hypothesis,  as in the  case of 
PSM  estimator.  The  version  of  the  common  support  hypothesis  for  DIDM,  however, 
requires  all  treated  firms  to  have  a  counterpart  in  the  non-treated  population  observed 
before and after treatment. Formally: 

(cid:8)%(cid:7)", (cid:11) 1|(cid:6)(cid:10), ,& ’ 1 [5] 

Based on those assumptions, the ATT parameter for accessing PSI estimated by DIDM, in 
the region of common support of (cid:6) in the sample, is formally defined as: 
 

(cid:16)(cid:17)-.-(cid:20) (cid:11) ∑(cid:10)∈(cid:23)(cid:24)%(cid:25)(cid:10)) (cid:26) (cid:25)(cid:10),)+(cid:2)& (cid:26) ∑(cid:27)∈(cid:28)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:10)(cid:27)%(cid:25)(cid:27)) (cid:26) (cid:25)(cid:27),)+(cid:2)&(cid:31)(cid:29)(cid:10) [6] 

In which notation is similar to that used previously. It is expected that this method is able to 
better  control  a  possible  selection  bias  associated  with  program  participation  when 
compared to the PSM, as Heckman et al, 1997 have demonstrated. 
 
Database 
 
In  order  to  apply  the  methods  described  in  the  previous  section  it  was  necessary  to 
construct  a  database  that,  on  the  one  hand,  listed  the  companies  that  have  accessed  the 
program and, on the other, consolidated a set of economic characteristics for a large group 
of firms, a requirement for determining comparable groups of non-treated. 
 
A list of companies who used the program was obtained through a consolidated database 
from the BNDES’ operational records, consolidating information for all releases associated 
with the acquisition of machinery and equipment carried out under PSI-Phase 1. Companies 
receiving PSI support totaled 18,624 in 2009 and 36,761 in  2010. Although PSI finances 
firms from various sectors of the economy, this evaluation focused on the industrial sector. 
Considering only this segment, the number of firms financed by PSI reached 4,271 in 2009 
and 10,317 in 2010, as shown in Table 2. 
 
Table 3 shows the total PSI disbursement to financed companies per group size and sector. 
The  main  information  to  note  in  this  table  is  the  total  amount  disbursed  in  loans  to  the 
industrial  sector,  which  reached  approximately  R$  1.7  billion  in  2009  and  approximately 
R$  8.6  billion  in  2010,  totaling  just  over  R$  10  billion  in  disbursements  during  the  first 
phase of the program.

To obtain reliable  economic characteristics on program users, this study  chose to use the 
Industrial  Survey  (PIA  Enterprise)  of  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics 
(IBGE), which is the most important source of micro-data from Brazilian Industrial Sector. 
In this study, we took into consideration data from this Survey for the years 2007 – 20109 
and worked solely with firms surveyed in Right Stratum10, because there are more detailed 
economic  and  financial  information,  required  to  implement  the  identification  strategy 
adopted. 
 
After merging BNDES and PIA databases, we constructed a dummy (called psi) that took a 
value  of  1  when  observation  had  received  any  amount  of  PSI  resources,  and  zero 
otherwise11. Then, exploratory analysis and information validation were conducted, in order 
to  identify  outliers  and  observations  with  insufficient  or  inconsistent  information.  An 
important decision taken while consolidating the database was to exclude all observations 
with declared investment equal to zero.  
 
This choice represents an undeniable bias towards increasing the average investment in the 
control  group  and,  therefore,  a  bias  towards  underestimating  the  effect  of  the  program  – 
which stands against the tested hypothesis. Moreover, as the PSI is an investment financing 
program,  one  could  argue  that  companies  that  have  chosen  not  to  invest  would  be,  by 
definition,  ineligible  for  the  program  and,  therefore,  would  not  serve  as  a  comparison 
group. Again, that choice increases homogeneity between control and treatment groups. 
 
Finally,  companies  that  had  very  low  or  very  high  investment  rates  were  considered 
outliers12.  The  intention  was  to  exclude  companies  that  reported  a  volume  of  investment 
incompatible  with  declared  revenue,  in  order  to  reduce  informational  errors  that  might 
distort results. 
 
Clearly, the  methodological choices above reduced the number of observations available. 
Still,  the  final  base  was  a  robust  selection  of  information,  comprising  more  than  15,000 
industrial  companies  in  each  reference  year.  Of  this  total,  approximately  1,500  received 
resources  from  PSI  in  2009  and,  in  2010,  that  number  rose  to  approximately  3,700 
companies. Tables 4 and 5 aim to show the characteristics of groups of firms financed in 
comparison with the group of non-financed companies for each year in which the impact of 
PSI was estimated. The goal is to compare these groups in terms of the variables used in the 
estimated models before participating in the program to identify the degree of pre-existing 
heterogeneity  among  them.  Despite  the  fact  that  constructing  the  database  favored 
homogeneity,  the  group  of  financed  companies  still  shows  characteristics  that  are 
substantially different from the other group – emphasizing the difficulties involved at this 
exercise. In such cases, the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators tend to produce 
inconsistent estimates of the average impact of the program.

Results 
 
Table 6 shows the impact estimates of PSI on the current investment level of the industrial 
companies  and  compares  the  results  for  each  method  used  for  the  2009-2010  periods. 
Besides  PSM  and  DIDM  estimates13,  it  also  shows  basic  OLS  estimates  to  discuss  the 
selection bias problem. The first point to note is that all results presented in Table 6 indicate 
that  PSI  had  a  positive  and  statistically  significant  impact  on  the  industrial  companies’ 
investment level. This is certainly the main conclusion produced by this work.14

As  expected,  the  OLS  estimate  appears  to  have  a  positive  bias,  with  a  tendency  to 
overestimate the impact of the program. It is possible to see that the coefficients estimated 
using this method - respectively 0.96 and 0.95 for 2009 and 2010 - are substantially higher 
than those estimated using DIDM - 0.34 and 0.24. The coefficients estimated using PSM, in 
their turn, were closer to those made by OLS. This may indicate that most of the existing 
selection bias derives from unobservable variables.15 
 
It should be noticed that the average impact of PSI was higher in 2009 than in 2010. This 
was found in all proposed estimates, but was particularly strong in the DIDM specification 
–  precisely  the  better  method  to  control  the  problem  of  selection  bias.  In  this  model,  the 
coefficient falls from 0.34 to 0.24 from one year to next. 
 
Table 7 approaches the magnitude of the PSI impact on the companies’ investment level. 
Firstly, it shows the average investment in the sample for companies that used the program 
-  which  reached  approximately  R$  1.2  million  in  the  two  reference  years  (column  A). 
Column B uses the DIDM coefficients to estimate the counterfactual investment level for 

                                                            
13  Propensity  Score  of  the  company  estimated  by  Logit.  The  annex  to  this  study  presents  more  detailed 
estimated-selection equations and the respective set of conditional variables used in this first estimation step 
for each year. It is worth noting that all specifications satisfied the balancing properties, which is evidence 
that the selection model is well specified. For details on implementing the PSM, see Becker and Ichino (2002) 
and Leuven and Sianesi (2003), and DIDM, see Villa (2011). 
14 It is important to point out that several specifications were tested, with changes in the explained variable, in 
the definition of the sample and in the matching method. Altogether, some 28 estimations were carried out, 
and in 26 the result was a positive and statistically significant impact. Tables 12 and 13 in the Annex offer the 
results of all tested specifications. 
15 In the case of the OLS estimation, the same relation of variables used in the final selection equations for the 
PSM and the DIDM was used as covariates. In this case, the coefficient associated with the dummy psi was 
used to model the effect of access to PSI in the investment decision of companies. Again, further details of 
this specification can be found in the Annex.

each  year  in  the  analysis.  It  follows  that,  in  2009,  the  program's  impact  reached 
approximately R$ 352,000 per supported firm, considering that average firm. This number 
represents  an  increase  of  40%  compared  to  what  would  have  occurred  in  the  absence  of 
PSI.  Looking at 2010, this number  fell to R$ 272,000 – representing an increase of 28% 
(values shown in column C).16

The  decrease  in  the  average  impact  of  PSI  was  accompanied  by  a  rise  in  the  program’s 
average  disbursements  for  the  period,  which  reached  R$  465,000  in  2010  -  against  R$ 
298,000 a year earlier (column D in Table 7). These two combined movements generated a 
strong fall at the Effect  per Disbursement ratio (column E in Table 7). Thus, on average, 
every R$ 1 of PSI disbursement generated an impact of R$ 1.18 on company’s investment 
in 2009. In the next year, the same R$ 1 disbursed were associated with only R$ 0.58 of 
investments that would not have occurred without that financing.  
 
Therefore, in 2009, PSI was able to affect the investment decision to the extent it induced 
the  inclusion  of  other  capital  sources.  However,  in  2010,  it  is  possible  to  observe  some 
degree  of  substitution,  with  PSI  disbursements  taking  the  place  of  other  capital  sources. 
That  dynamic  suggests  that  PSI  potential  effect  decreased  during  the  analyzed  period. 
Three possible causes for this behavior were considered.  
 
The  first  possible  explanation  relies  on  the  credit  constraint  problem,  which  was 
particularly severe in 2009 when the financial crisis was acute. Therefore, it is natural that 
the  program  was  more  important  to  release  investment  decisions  of  Brazilian  industrial 
firms  in  that  year.  The  macroeconomic  context  was  very  different  in  2010,  when  the 
Brazilian economy seemed to be operating under normal conditions. 
 
A  second  possible  explanation  is  the  existence  of  a  negative  relationship  between  the 
marginal  effect  of  the  policy  (created  investment)  and  the  treatment  dose  (amount  of 
disbursements).  If  treatment  dose  matters,  the  reducing  policy  effectiveness  might  be,  at 

                                                            
16 Assuming that industrial companies financed by PSI outside our sample are similar to those that have been 
used  –  a  strong  assumption  –  it  is  possible  to  obtain  the  total  investment  added  by  PSI  on  the  Brazilian 
industrial  sector.  Using  the  average  impact  calculated  at  Table  7,  we  reach  approximately  R$  2  billion  in 
2009, when 4,271 companies used about R$ 1.7 billion in releases from the program. In 2010, that number 
would amount to approximately R$ 5 billion, associated with 10,317 companies financed with approximately 
R$ 8.6 billion in disbursements.

least in part, a  consequence of an increase of  PSI resources share inside  company’s total 
investment.  
 
Such explanation is consistent with a theoretical model in which each firm has a limit to its 
potential  investment  expansion.  In  this  scenario,  when  a  company’s  total  investment  is 
below this potential level, the policy would encourage the firm to expand its investments, 
but only up to a certain point. When this limit is reached, additional doses of the treatment 
would  merely  replace  financing  sources  in  the  firms’  capital  structure,  rather  than 
promoting the expansion of its investment level. 
 
Hence it is possible to suppose the existence of  an efficient point for the participation of 
PSI resources in company’s total investment. Beyond that point, additional resources would 
be marginally less efficient in creating investment. One possible implication of this view is 
that  the  effectiveness  of  the  program  could  be  increased  simply  by  reallocating  PSI 
resources  among  firms  -  reducing  PSI’s  share  in  the  capital  structure  of  companies  that 
received more than would be optimal, and increasing the share for those that received less. 
 
The  third  explanation  is  based  on  the  intertemporal  aspect  of  the  investment  decision.  In 
this  case,  companies  would  simply  take  advantage  of  the  more  attractive  PSI’s  financing 
conditions to realize in the current period investments that, otherwise, would have occurred 
in the future. In a nutshell, at least part of the PSI positive effect might be associated with 
anticipation rather than investment creation. If the long term companies’ investment is not 
affected by PSI, then the anticipating behavior has a limit.  
 
Final Considerations 
 
Within  a  context  in  which  GFCF  did  not  recover  the  pre-crisis  level,  recent  Brazilian 
economic  debate  has  questioned  PSI’s  capacity  to  influence  aggregate  investment  in  the 
economy. This study aimed to find evidence about the impacts of PSI using methods that 
could correctly address the selection bias problem. The main conclusion is the program had 
a positive impact on the investment level of industrial firms for the 2009-2010 periods.  
 
However, the decreasing estimated effect during the analyzed period has raised a number of 
questions,  which  still  need  to  be  investigated.  It  is  known  that  the  program  has  been 
extended  since  it  was  created,  with  financial  incentives  that  have  varied  according  to  the 
behavior  of  investment  in  the  economy.  Hence  it  is  essential  to  investigate  whether  this 
public policy is still capable of affecting investments of financed companies. 
 
In order to do so, the future research agenda intends to evaluate each of the possible causes 
of  the  decreasing  additionality  of  the  program.  Besides,  it  is  relevant  to  address  possible 
indirect  effects  of  the  program  on  different  outcomes,  such  as  employment  and 
productivity.
