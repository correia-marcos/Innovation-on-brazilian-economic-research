Abstract

We re-examine the validity of the Expectation Hypothesis (EH) of the term structure for
Brazilian market ﬁxed income using data from Jan-2000 to Jun-2017. Furthermore, we investigated
the out-of-sample predictability of bond excess returns by means of common factors extracted a
cross-section of Brazilian macro-variables and zero-coupon interest rates. The EH is rejected
throughout the term structure examined on the basis of the statistical tests across the entire
maturity spectrum considered. Our results conﬁrm previous ﬁndings that a linear combination of
forward rates and macroeconomic factors can explain a substantial portion of movements in the
Brazilian excess returns. We ﬁnd that macroeconomic factor have an important predictive content
for excess returns.

1. Introduction

The expectations hypothesis (EH) of the term structure of interest rates, the proposition that the
long-term yield is determined by the market’s expectation of the short-term yields over the holding
period of the long-term asset plus a constant risk premium, has attracted considerable attention,
both within academic and practitioner circles. The expectations hypothesis, which asserts that
expected excess returns are time invariant, plays an important role in economics and ﬁnance,
especially in monetary policy analyses. If the expectations theory prevails, then central banks can
inﬂuence long-rates by operating at the short-end of the market. Hence, it is not surprising that
the EH has been tested extensively using a wide variety of interest rates and over a variety of time
periods, mostly for developed countries. The empirical studies documents that the expectations
hypothesis (EH) of the term structure of interest rates is rejected by the data in the majority
of cases and argues, almost unequivocally, that deviations from the EH reﬂect time-varying risk
premia.

This study aims at formally testing the validity of the expectations hypothesis for the ﬁxed
income market in Brazil. The objective is empirically investigate the predictability of excess returns
on Brazilian zero-coupon bonds with maturities ranging from 2 to 5 years. It is well known that the
expectation hypothesis is rejected in favor of bond returns being predictable by forward or yield
spreads. As predictors we use the forward spread variable of Fama & Bliss (1987), the Cochrane
& Piazzesi (2005) combination of forward rates, and the Ludvigson & Ng (2009) macro factors.
Although less extensive than the equity return predictability literature, various studies aim to
predict government bond excess returns as well. The issue of bond return predictability is of great
interest to academics and practitioners. For academic researchers, the interest in predictability
lies mainly in understanding why investors’ required risk compensation should vary over time. For
investors, predictability of returns is naturally attractive from an asset management perspective.
At the macroeconomic level, moreover, the EH is relevant to understand the impact of monetary
policy and its transmission mechanism.

There is an extensive literature investigating the predictability of bond excess returns, mostly
by extracting information from the yield curve and macroeconomic fundamentals. This literature
ﬁnds evidence of a time-varying risk premia in bond returns. One strand of research relates such
variations to forward spreads and yield spreads. Fama & Bliss (1987) (hereafter FB) and Campbell
& Shiller (1991) ﬁnd that the spreads between forward and spot rates have predictive power for
excess returns and its forecasting power increases with the forecast horizon. Cochrane & Piazzesi
(2005) (hereafter CP) run predictive regressions of one year excess log returns by considering a
combination of forward rates as predictors and ﬁnd that information in the term structure of
interest rates can capture up to 44 per cent of the variation of one year excess bond returns.
Using US bonds data, Thornton & Valente (2012) and Sarno et al.
(2016) evaluate the out-of-
sample forecasting ability of the predictors in FB and CP in a dynamic asset allocation strategy
and ﬁnd that predictive models using long-term forward rates are unable to generate economic
value over the expectations hypothesis (EH) no-predictability benchmark. Gargano et al. (2017),
using models that allow for time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility in the predictive
regressions leads to substantial gains in out-of-sample forecasting accuracy compared with the
expectation hypothesis.

More recent developments in this literature link the predictable component to factors whose
variations lie outside the span of current yields, such as macroeconomic variables. For example,

3

Ludvigson & Ng (2009) and Cooper & Priestley (2009) document that macro factors predict bond
returns, adding incremental forecasting power in excess of information contained in yields. Moving
away from yield curve information, Wright (2011) considers survey forecasts on macroeconomic
fundamentals to improve term premia estimates. Eriksen (2017), using survey forecasts from
Survey of Professional Forecasters, extracts proxy for expected business condition and ﬁnd it
consistently aﬀects bond excess returns beyond the current term structure and macroeconomic
variables. In international markets, several studies (e.g., Dahlquist & Hasseltoft, 2013; Zhu, 2015,
and references therein) ﬁnd that forward rates strongly predict international excess bond returns.
While most of the empirical studies focuses on the developed countries, particularly on U.S.
data, this very important literature has remained scarce for the emerging market cases. Brazil is
one of the emerging market economies that can constitute an important case study for this type
of research as it has one of the biggest bond markets in the world among the developing countries.
Therefore, in this paper we aim to ﬁll this gap by presenting a new research for Brazilian market
ﬁxed income. Motivated by the enormous growth of the Brazilian ﬁxed income market over the
past 15 years, we employ forward spreads, macro factors, or the term structure of forward rates
as predictors to evaluate the validity of the expectations hypothesis and test the predictability of
bond excess returns in Brazil.

We empirically examine Brazilian term structure dynamics using monthly observations from
January 2000 to June 2017. Our ﬁndings indeed suggest that Brazilian yield curve its not consistent
with the expectations hypothesis for the data period considered in the study. We ﬁnd evidence of
time-varying risk-premium to all maturities. Our results suggest that macro factors do contribute
substantially to the understanding of the dynamics of risk premia in the Brazilian ﬁxed income
market. The out-of-sample forecasting analysis shows that the macro, LNt, factor consistently
delivers signiﬁcant out-of-sample gains relative to the expectations hypothesis of interest rates (the
historical average). A two-factor model comprising the Cochrane & Piazzesi (2005) combination
of forward rates and the Ludvigson & Ng (2009) macro factor generates notable gains in out-
of-sample forecast accuracy compared with a model based on the expectations hypothesis. The
forecasts turn out that the expectations hypothesis fails in the Brazilian ﬁxed income market.
Hence, the usefulness of the EH, longer-term rates incorporate the markets’ expectation for the
future short-term rate, for ﬁnancial market analysts and policymakers is doubtful. Furthermore, to
the best of our knowledge, this article is the ﬁrst to applies FB forward spread, CP combination of
forwards, and LN macro factor to evaluate the EH and to predict excess bond returns in Brazilian
ﬁxed income market.

The existing related literature for Brazilian market is very limited. One related study by Tabak
(2009) tested the expectations hypothesis (EH) using cointegration techniques, for maturities rang-
ing from 1 to 12 months, covering the period from 1995 to 2006. They found evidence suggesting
that support the EH and that the risk premium may be time-varying. Lima & Issler (2003) and
Tabak & Andrade (2003), have found evidence of time-varying risk premium for the term structure
of interest rates for Brazil. Lima & Issler (2007) tested the expectations hypothesis for Brazil using
cointegration and found evidence contrary to EH. Our ﬁnds are similar to Tabak (2009) and Lima
& Issler (2003), that ﬁnd evidence of time varying risk premium for the term structure of interest
rates for Brazil.

The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the EH and the models based on
forward rates or forward spreads within which the empirical work is carried out. Section 3 brieﬂy
describes the data and preliminary statistics on our dataset and reports the main empirical results.

2. Bond Returns, Risk Premia and The Expectations Hypothesis

The bond risk premium measures the compensation required by risk averse investors to hold long-
term government bonds for facing capital loss risk, if the bond is sold before maturity.

2.1. Bond returns and forward rates

Consider an τ-period zero coupon bond paying $1 at maturity, whose nominal price at time t
. Let τ be the bond maturity in years. The continuously compounded log-yield to maturity

is P (τ )
of the bond, y(τ )

t

t ≡ − 1

(1)

t

is the log price of the zero-coupon bond at time t - that is, p(τ )

where p(τ )
. It represents
the per period interest rate earned from holding the bond to maturity if gains are continuously
compounded. Denote the frequency (in months) at which returns are computed by h. The log
forward rate at time t for loans between periods t + τ − h and t + τ is then deﬁned as

t = log P (τ )

t

f (τ,h)
t

≡ p(τ−h)

t

− p(τ )

t = τ y(τ )

t − (τ − h)y(τ−h)

t

.

(2)

The one-year holding period return for a bond with maturity τ-years is the return of buying
a bond with τ-years to maturity at time t, selling it one year later, at time t + 1, as a bond with
(τ−1)-years to maturity, i.e.,

t+1 = p(τ−1)
r(τ )

t = τ y(τ )

t − (τ − 1) y(τ−1)

t+1

,

(3)

The expected one-year holding period return on long term bonds equals the expected return on
the short term bond plus the return risk premium

accordingly the excess return (return risk premium) of an τ-year bond is computed as the one-year

2.2. The expectations hypothesis and risk premia
The expectations hypothesis is a natural starting point to study the term structure of interest rates
and also to relate macroeconomic fundamentals to the yield curve.2 The expectations hypothesis

2There are basically two others theories about the shape of the term structure: i) The market segmentation
theory says that the is not a necessary relationship between short, medium and long term rates. Interest rate
levels are simply given by supply – demand pricing process; ii) The liquidity preference theory is based on the
assumption that investors “prefer” liquidity so they tend to invest for short periods while companies and institutions

5

(EH) of the term structure of interest rates is the proposition that the long-term yield is deter-
mined by the market’s expectation for the short-term rate plus a constant yield risk premium.
Fundamentally, the EH depends on the market’s ability to predict the future short-term rate.

Long-term yields are determined as the average future short rate expected over the life of the
bond, which are referred as the expectations hypothesis (EH) term, plus the yield risk premium
or term premium.3 Assuming a minimum investment horizon of one-year, we have

is the yield at time t for a long-term bond τ -period maturity, y(1)

where y(τ )
t denotes the short-term
(one-year) rate, and κ(τ )
t denotes a constant risk premium that may vary with the maturity of the
yields. Under the expectations hypothesis, the yield risk premium may be maturity-speciﬁc but
does not change over time.

The relation between the return risk premium and the yield risk premium is as follows:

which means that the yield risk premium is the average of expected future return risk premia of
declining maturity. Et(·) denotes the conditional expectation given market information at time t.
Notice that each of the conditional expectation terms on the right-hand side of Equation (7) are
forecasts of excess bond returns, multiple steps ahead. Thus, Equation (7) shows that the excess
bond return forecasts have direct implications for risk premia in yields, as well as risk premia
in returns. To form an estimate of the risk-premium component in yields, κ(τ )
, we must form
estimates of the multistep-ahead forecasts that appear on the right-hand side of Equation (7), i.e.,

(8)

where (cid:98)Et(·) denotes an estimate of the conditional expectation Et(·) formed by a linear projec-

tion. Thus, estimates of the conditional expectations are simply linear forecasts of excess returns,
multiple steps ahead.

According to the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates, the yield risk
premium is constant. This implies that expected excess returns are time invariant and, thus,
excess bond returns should not be predictable with variables in the information set at time t.
However, empirical tests of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure often rejected using
a wide variety of tests and data, over a variety of time periods and monetary policy regimes, and

“prefer” to borrow for longer period. Those behaviors lead to an upward shape of the yield curve where forward
rates are higher than the expectations on future spot rates.

3The literature distinguishes between the strong (pure) expectations hypothesis, which postulates that: a) ex-
pected excess returns on long-term over short-term bonds are zero; b) yield term premia are zero; c) forward term
premia are zero; from the expectations hypothesis, which postulates that: a) expected excess returns are constant
over time; b) yield term premia are constant; c) forward term premia are constant over time.

6

argues that deviations from the EH reﬂect time-varying risk premia. The most commonly given
reason for the failure of the EH is that the risk premium is not constant as the EH requires,
but is time-varying. The logic underlying the theory, that expectations of future short interest
rates shape the term structure of longer interest rates, is intuitive, appealing, and a common
assumption in macroeconomic modeling. However, the predictability of excess returns undermines
the premise that long interest rates are rational expectations of future short rates up to a constant
term premium. Rather, such evidence points strongly toward time-varying risk premia.

A number of studies indicate the presence of predictable variation in government bond excess
returns. Most of these empirical studies have employed information from the term structure of
spot and forward rates in order to predict bond returns (see e.g. Fama & Bliss, 1987; Campbell &
Shiller, 1991; Cochrane & Piazzesi, 2005). Ludvigson & Ng (2009) ﬁnd that macroeconomic factors
constructed as linear and non-linear combinations of principal components extracted from a large
data-set of macroeconomic variables have important forecasting power for future excess returns
on U.S. government bonds, which is independent from that contained in forward rates and yield
spreads. More recent evidence by Thornton & Valente (2012) shows that the predictive capability
of forward rates does not translate into systematic economic value by means of a dynamic asset
allocation strategy.

2.3. Forecasting bond excess returns using forward rates and macro factors
Our objective is to forecast expected excess bond returns. To assess the statistical evidence on
bond return predictability, we run regressions of bond excess returns at time t + h on forward rates
at time t. Speciﬁcally, we consider forward spreads as proposed by Fama & Bliss (1987), a linear
combination of forward rates as proposed by Cochrane & Piazzesi (2005), and a linear combination
of macro factors, as proposed by Ludvigson & Ng (2009). The FB forward spreads are given by

So, FB estimate the excess return equations

rx(τ )

t+h = β0 + β1f s(τ,h)

t + ε(τ )
t+h,

(9)

(10)

where τ ∈ {2, . . . , 5} denotes the vector of maturities measured in years.

In this spirit, Cochrane & Piazzesi (2005) extend the Fama & Bliss (1987) approach and run
regressions of excess returns on all forward rates. CP estimate a general regression where bond
excess returns are predicted by the full term structure of forward rates and the one-period yield:

rx(τ )

t+h = β(τ )

0 + β(τ )

t + β(τ )

2 f (τ2)

t + . . . + β(τ )

5 f (τ5)

t + ε(τ )
t+h,

(11)

Drawing on the fact that the same function of forward rates predicts holding period returns
at all maturities, CP construct a tent-shaped linear combination of forward rates, namely the
CP factor, to parsimoniously predict future excess bond returns. This tent shaped forward rate
factor subsumes the predictive content of forward spread, yield spread and yield factors estimated
as principal components of the yield covariance matrix, which were documented to forecast bond
excess returns. Speciﬁcally, the CP factor is constructed by regressing the average excess return

7

across maturities at each time t on the one-year yield and four forward rates. To simplify the
notation, we drop the index τ from the excess return. The average excess return across the bond
maturity spectrum is given as

τ =2

rxt+1 =

rx(τ )

(12)

which can be thought of as the annual excess log holding period return to an equally-weighted
portfolio of risky bonds with maturities ranging from two through 5 years. CP then construct
their return-forecasting factor by estimating

rxt+1 = γ0 + γ1y(1)

t + γ2f (τ2)

t + . . . + γ5f (τ5)

t + υt+h = γ(cid:48)Zt + υt+h,

where Zt =

(cid:105)(cid:48)

. Then estimate the equation

rx(τ )

t+1 = ζ + λ (γ(cid:48)Zt) + t+1.

(13)

(14)

CP ﬁnd that Equation (14) encompasses equation (11). Note that when the regression coeﬃcients
(cid:48)
β(cid:48) = [β1, . . . , β5]
= 0, this speciﬁcation reduces to the expectation hypothesis, under which bond
excess returns are unpredictable and bond risk premia are constant over time. Following Thornton
& Valente (2012) and Gargano et al. (2017), we use this historical average of excess bond returns
to serve as a natural benchmark forecasting model. Indeed, the historical average is consistent
with the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates.

Ludvigson & Ng (2009) ﬁnd that “real” and “inﬂation” factors, extracted from a large number of
macroeconomic time series, have signiﬁcant forecasting power for future excess returns on nominal
bonds and that this predictability is above and beyond the predictive power contained in forward
rates and yield spreads. Suppose we observe a T × M panel of macroeconomic variables {xi,t}
generated by a factor model

xi,t = κift + i,t

(15)
where ft is an s × 1 vector of common factors and s << M . The unobserved common factor, ft

is replaced by an estimate,(cid:98)ft, obtained using principal components analysis. Following Gargano
principal components extracted from a large dataset of 82 macroeconomic data series,4 (cid:98)Ft =
(cid:104)(cid:98)f1,t,(cid:98)f2,t,(cid:98)f3,t,(cid:98)f4,t,(cid:98)f8,t

(2017), we build a single linear combination from a subset of the ﬁrst eight estimated

to obtain the LNt factor

(16)

4The data broadly cover the same economic categories used in Ludvigson & Ng (2009). In particular, the series
include output and labor market variables, exchange rates, expenditure and debt, energy consumption, exchange
of goods and services price and industry indexes, and the money stock. These variables came from the Brazilian
Central Bank, the FGV, the IBGE, the IPEADATA, and the Bloomberg database. Additional details about this
data set can be found in Medeiros et al. (2016).

where Ψ is obtained from the projection

rxt+1 = ψ0 + ψ1(cid:98)f1,t + ψ2(cid:98)f2,t + ψ2(cid:98)f3,t + ψ2(cid:98)f4,t + ψ5(cid:98)f8,t + ηt+h.

(17)

The number of latent factors was determined by the information criteria developed in Bai & Ng
(2002). We choose among a range of possible speciﬁcations (linear combination of factors) for the
forecasting regressions of excess bond returns based on the estimated common factors using the
BIC criterion.

3. Data and empirical results

3.1. Data

Our data consist of end of the month 1- to 5-year zero-coupon yields between January 2000 and
June 2017. This choice provides us with a panel of 210 monthly observations on 5 diﬀerent yields.
The data set consists of end-of- month yields of Brazilian interbank deposit future contracts (DI-
futuro) collected on a monthly basis. The source of the data is the Brazilian Mercantile and Futures
Exchange (BM&FBovespa), which is the entity that oﬀers DI-futuro contracts and determines the
maturities with authorized contracts. The DI-futuro contract with maturity τ is a zero-coupon
future contract in which the underlying asset is the DI-futuro interest rate accrued on a daily
basis, capitalized between trading period t and τ. The DI-futuro rate is the average daily rate
of Brazilian interbank deposits (borowing/lending), calculated by the Clearinghouse for Custody
and Settlements (CETIP) for all business days. The DI-futuro rate, which is published on a daily
basis, is expressed in annually compounded terms, based on 252 business days.5

Panel A in Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the Brazilian bond excess returns based on
the DI-futuro market and Fama-Bliss forward spreads along with the CPt and LNt factors. For each
time series we report the mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis and sample autocorrelation
for lag-1. The summary statistics displayed in Table 1 show that excess returns are positive and
highly serially correlated. As expected, the mean and standard deviation of excess returns increase
with maturity, consistent with the existence of a risk premium for long maturities.Regarding return
predictors, we ﬁnd that Fama-Bliss forward spreads are strongly positively autocorrelated with
ﬁrst-order autocorrelation coeﬃcients around 0.80. The CPt and LNt factors also exhibit high
ﬁrst-order autocorrelations, of 0.82 and 0.80, respectively. Panel B shows that the Fama-Bliss
spreads are strongly positively correlated with the CPt factor, with correlations around 0.8, but
are far less autocorrelated with the LNt factor. The LNt factor captures a largely orthogonal
component in relation to the other predictors. As expected, excess returns are correlated with
lagged CPt factor, re-assuring that the shape of the yield curve contain information on bond risk
premium. Figure 1 shows the predicted and realized 1-year holding period excess returns from the
predictive regressions using the CP factor, for maturities of 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year. The ﬁgure shows
that the CPt factor is is able to predict the average excess return.

3.2. Statistical Evaluation

This section presents the results from our in-sample empirical analyses. We begin by consid-
ering results based on full sample estimates to remain comparable with the existing literature on

expectation hypothesis and bond risk premia. The parameters in FB and CP models are estimated
using 210 observations between 2000:01-2017:06 at a monthly frequency. The null hypothesis we
test is no-predictability, i.e. β(τi) = 0, and hence regression reduces to expectation hypothesis.
Tables 2 and 3 presents results from estimating predictive regressions (FB, CP, and LN) over the
full range of available observations. We report slope estimates, t-statistics based on Newey & West
(1987) standard errors implemented with 18 lags, and adjusted R2 values. Given that overlapping
and autocorrelated data may impact our OLS estimation, we follow Cochrane & Piazzesi (2005)
and consider several correction methods to increase the robustness of our results. These include
the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) correction and Newey & West (1987) correction with
18 lags.

We begin with the results for the CP model computed over the full sample period presented in
the left side of Table 2. The χ2 statistic demonstrates that the EH can be rejected at the 5 per
cent level for all considered maturities, indicating that bond excess returns in Brazil are somewhat
predictable. We see that the CP model is able to explain 34-45% of the one-year ahead variation
in bond risk premia across the maturity spectrum. Similarly to Cochrane & Piazzesi (2005) and
Eriksen (2017), we obtain signiﬁcant slope coeﬃcients that are monotonically increasing with
maturity. Next, we turn to our variant of the forward-spread model from Fama & Bliss (1987),
in the right side of Table 2. FBt is able to explain between 26% and 30% of the one-year ahead
variation in bond risk premia, where the largest proportion is explained for the two- and four-year
bonds. One more time the EH can be rejected at 5% level and we ﬁnd evidence of time varying
risk-premium across the maturity spectrum.

rate-based factor from Cochrane & Piazzesi (2005), and the macro-based factor LNt from Ludvigson
& Ng (2009). This models are estimated in two steps. For CP model, ﬁrst we estimate γ by running
a regression of the average excess return (portfolio of all bonds) on all forward rates, and then, we
estimate λ(τ) by running four regressions of one-year ahead excess returns upon the macro factor
we have attained in the ﬁrst step. For LN model, ﬁrst we compute the LNt factor from a projection
of the time-series of cross-sectional averages of the 2, 3, 4, 5 bond excess returns on ﬁve principal
components obtained from a large panel of macroeconomic variables, and then, we estimate the
slope coeﬃcients by running four regressions we have attained in the ﬁrst step. In both cases, the
slope coeﬃcients for the univariate models increase monotonically in the maturity of the bonds.
All the coeﬃcients are signiﬁcant across all maturities and forecasting models.

For CP model, the results shows that although the coeﬃcients diﬀer slightly across both spec-
’s are almost the same for the single-factor
iﬁcations, restricted and unrestricted models, their R
restriction as for the unrestricted regressions. The restricted model, λ(τ) · γ, almost perfectly
matches unrestricted coeﬃcients. For example, a comparison of unrestricted model coeﬃcients for
a 2-year maturity (−5.93, − 0.81, 2.38, − 1.50, 3.13, − 2.77) with coeﬃcient implied from the
restricted model (−13.97, − 2.05, 5.16, − 4.40, 10.15, − 7.96)× 0.38 = (−5.31, − 0.78, 1.96, −
1.67, 3.80, − 3.02). Both models thus have similar explanatory power, allowing us to focus on the
more parsimonious restricted speciﬁcation.

2

Now, we turn to the macro-factor from Ludvigson & Ng (2009). In general, our results suggest
that macro factors do contribute substantially to the understanding of the dynamics of excess-
return in Brazilian ﬁxed income market. Speciﬁcally, LNt is able to explain between 30% and
47% of the one-year ahead variation in excess-returns, where the largest proportion is explained
for the four- and ﬁve-year bonds. As a last step, we consider a two-factor speciﬁcation using
CPt and LNt that investigates whether macro-factors contain information about excess returns
that is distinguishably diﬀerent from that contained in the yield curve. As it turns out, both are
individually strongly signiﬁcant for all bond maturities, suggesting that they capture quite distinct
aspects of the set of risks that governs the time-variations in excess returns. Similar to Ludvigson
& Ng (2009) and Eriksen (2017), we ﬁnd CPt and LNt to contain complementary information as
both factors remain signiﬁcant and jointly produce adjusted R2 values larger than their individual
values for all maturities and both factors remains signiﬁcant at 5% level for all maturities.

In summary, our in-sample estimation results indicates that we did not ﬁnd evidence supportive
of the expectations hypothesis theory for Brazilian yield curve. An important implication of this
is that Brazilian central banks have a low ability to inﬂuence long rates through monetary policy
adjustments of short rates. This is, for example, of particular relevance to those investment
decisions based on interest rates at the longer end of the maturity spectrum. The Brazilian
interest rates fail to support the expectations hypothesis possibly due to the times of high volatility,
resulting in large deviations between the expected and the actual spread. This is consistent with
previous studies such as Beechey et al. (2009) which found that the EH did not hold in developing
countries due to high volatility interest rates.

3.3. Out-of-sample forecasting

In this section, we evaluate the ability of the bond return prediction models from Section 2.3
to accurately forecast bond risk premia in an out-of-sample setting using information available
at the time of the forecast only. As argued by Thornton & Valente (2012), Eriksen (2017), and
Gargano et al.
(2017), among others, a good in-sample ﬁt does not necessarily translate into
positive out-of-sample performance.

14

3.3.1. Statistical evaluation

To access the real-time performance of the bond return prediction models, we consider a sta-
tistical evaluation of the predictive accuracy of the out-of-sample forecasts relative to a recursively
updated expectations hypothesis (EH) benchmark computed as a recursively updated projection
of bond excess returns upon a constant. For that, we use 2000:01-2010:12 as our initial warm-
up estimation sample and 2011:01-2017:06 as the forecast evaluation period. The forecasts are
generated recursively using an expanding window of observations, where model parameters and
predictor variables are updated recursively prior to each forecast as well. Importantly, we rely on
historically available information only, information available at time t to compute return forecasts
for period t + 1, to mimic a real-time forecasting environment and avoid concerns of look-ahead
bias induced by full sample parameters.

We follow Eriksen (2017) and consider two measures of statistical signiﬁcance well-known to
the literature. First, to measure the relative performance of the FB, CP, and LN models with
respect to the expectations hypothesis, we use the relative mean square forecast error (rMSFE).
The MSFE is computed as

t+1 and(cid:99)rx(τ )

where rx(τ )
t+1,m denote the forecast from the ith candidate model and the EH benchmark
model, respectively, and T s is the number of out-of-sample forecasts. Next, following Campbell &
Thompson (2008), we provide for each bond maturity and model, an out-of-sample R2 relative to
the EH benchmark model given as

T s(cid:88)

whereby a positive R2
OoS,m indicates that the point forecasts associated with the model m are, on
average, more accurate than the EH benchmark forecasts. To gauge the signiﬁcance of ROoS, we
use the test for equal predictive accuracy suggested by Clark & West (2007).

Table 4 presents results from the statistical evaluation of the models against the EH benchmark
across the four bond maturities. We see that FBt and CPt factor performs poorly against the EH
benchmark for the full spectrum of maturities, where it realizes negative ROoS, −2.80% to −1.40%.
We ﬁnd little evidence that individual models considered are able to improve on the predictive
accuracy of the EH model, although the LNt fare better for the longer bond maturities. Conversely,
considering a two-factor model including CPt and LNt results in consistently positive ROoS in the
range of 1.42% to 4.90% over the spectrum of bond maturities, signaling a forecasting performance
superior to the simple EH benchmark of constant expected returns, which are all signiﬁcantly
positive at 10% conﬁdence at least according to the Clark & West (2007) tests. Consequently, CPt
and LNt appear to contain complementary information that results in signiﬁcant out-of-sample
forecasting gains.

4. Conclusion

The expectation hypothesis (EH) plays important roles in economics and ﬁnance and, not surpris-
ingly, has been widely tested using a variety of tests and datam mainly for developed markets. This
study analyze the expectation hypothesis and investigates the predictive power of term structure
of interest rates and macroeconomic factors for excess bond returns in the Brazilian ﬁxed income
market. As predictors we use the forward spread variable of Fama & Bliss (1987), the Cochrane &
Piazzesi (2005) combination of forward rates, and the Ludvigson & Ng (2009) macro factors. The
results show that the no-predictability benchmark is diﬃcult to beat in by either of the competing
forward-rate models and macroeconomic factors.

Our empirical ﬁndings indeed suggest that the Brazilian interest rates fail to support the expec-
tations hypothesis. We ﬁnd that excess returns are indeed predictable, although the predictability
is not as high as documented in previous literature (for example, Gargano et al. , 2017; Eriksen,
2017, and references therein). We show that macroeconomic factors have an important role in
forecasting excess bond returns in Brazilian ﬁxed income market. Macro risks are unspanned in
yields but help predict bond returns, consistent with the evidences in recent literature. Impor-
tantly, we also ﬁnd that a two factor model including CP and LN factors signiﬁcantly improve the
predictive power for excess returns. The forecasts turn out that the expectations hypothesis fails
in the Brazilian ﬁxed income market.

In future research, we plan to extend our empirical application to allows for time varying
regression parameters and stochastic volatility dynamics and investigates the economic gains to
an investor who exploits the predictability of bond excess returns relative to the no-predictability
alternative consistent with the expectations hypothesis.
