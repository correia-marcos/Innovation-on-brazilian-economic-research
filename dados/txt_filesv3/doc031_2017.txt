Abstract 

 
This study is a contribution to the literature concerning credibility and its effect on the 
distribution  between  forward-looking  behavior  and  backward-looking  behavior  for 
formation  of  inflation  expectations  in  the  case  of  emerging  economies.  Based  on  data 
gathered  from  seven  inflation  targeting  emerging  economies  (Brazil,  Chile,  Colombia, 
Mexico, Poland, South Africa, and Turkey), this paper analyzes how much the credibility 
associated with  the inflation target  contributes  to  anchoring expectations. The findings 
denote  that  although  credibility  is  relevant  to  reduce  inflation  expectations,  these 
countries  present  low  monetary  credibility  and  thus  the  backward-looking  behavior  is 
predominant for the formation of inflation expectations. In brief, the evidence presented 
in this study indicates that the adoption of inflation targeting in emerging economies does 
not represent a framework able to anchor inflation expectations.

1. Introduction 
 

Nowadays  there  exists  a  consensus  that  credibility  is  a  key  tool  for  managing 
monetary policy. As pointed out by Woodford (2004), the success for a central bank in 
the management of the monetary policy depends on the extent to which the expectations 
of the public are reshaped by the announced targets. The adoption of inflation targeting 
for several central banks since the 1990s is a clear demonstration that there is a belief that 
the announcement of targets  is  a framework to  anchor inflation expectations. This  is a 
point that deserves attention. A huge amount of literature concerning inflation targeting 
shows the advantages and the disadvantages of this monetary regime and, in particular, 
highlights that a condition for success is the presence of credibility.1 

The  essence  of  credibility  is  the  belief  by  the  public  in  the  probability  of  a 
successful execution of a policy. In the context of inflation targeting, there is no doubt 
that credibility is a  forward-looking concept  and it is  directly connected  with  inflation 
expectations.  In  the  case  of  inflation  target,  inflation  expectations  is  the  heart  of  the 
system. The main idea is that the success of inflation targeting can represent a lower social 
cost  (lower  sacrifice  ratio)  because  a  disinflation  process  can  be  reached  through  a 
decrease in inflation expectations without an increase in the interest rate. Hence, how to 
achieve  this  performance?  Credibility  is  the  answer  to  this  question.  In  other  words, 
inflation can be reduced without cost (through inflation expectations transmission) only 
in  the  case  that  the  public  believes  that  the  central  bank  has  competence  to  reach  the 
announced target. 

A natural positive issue that concerns monetary policymakers that makes use of 
inflation targeting is how the public responds to the announced targets. When the public 
believes in the announced target, and thus there exists credibility, inflation expectations 
are anchored and the central bank is able to guide expectations. In contrast, in the case 
where  the  public  does  not  believe  in  the  targets,  the  benefits  due  to  the  adoption  of 
inflation targeting are not observed. In this context, some studies are concerned with the 
direct  impact  of  inflation  targets  on  expected  inflation.  Based  on  an  analysis  which 
considers  five  targeting  developed  countries,  Johnson  (2002  and  2003)  observed  that 
targets reduced the level of expected inflation. Levin, Natalucci, and Piger (2004), making 
use  of  the  same  developed  countries  for  the  period  1994  to  2003,  found  that  inflation 
targeting has played a role in anchoring inflation expectations and in reducing inflation 
persistence. 

In the last years some studies have attempted to show empirical evidence on the 
relation between credibility and inflation taking into account deviations from the inflation 
target. In general, these studies are concerned with the main determinants of credibility. 
Bordo and Siklos (2016), based on  a sample for  up to  eighty  economies  from  1980 to 
2014  observed  that  inflation  target  and  central  bank  transparency  are  the  main 
determinants of credibility. Neuenkirch and Tillmann (2014) in an investigation for five 
developed  economies  concluded  that  inflation  expectations  are  sensitive  to  deviations 
from  the  target.  Yigit  (2010)  in  an  analysis  for  eight  developed  economies  found  a 
reduction in inflation memory after the adoption of inflation targeting. 

There  exist  few  studies  regarding  the  effect  of  monetary  policy  credibility  on 
inflation and public inflation expectations for emerging economies.  Yuxiang and Chen 
(2010) in an analysis based on a survey about inflation in the Chinese economy in 2008 
observed that credibility  helps to stabilize inflation expectations. In an analysis for the

Brazilian  economy,  de  Mendonça  and  Tostes  (2015)  analyzed  the  effect  of  monetary 
policy credibility on exchange rate pass-through and found that credibility is only relevant 
for reducing inflation for the market prices. Montes et al. (2016) also in an analysis of the 
Brazilian economy for the period 2003 to 2015 concluded that transparency (a measure 
of credibility) is an important tool in reducing disagreement about inflation expectations. 
This study is a contribution to the empirical literature concerning credibility and 
its  effect  on  the  distribution  between  forward-looking  behavior  and  backward-looking 
behavior for the formation of inflation expectations in the case of emerging economies. 
In order to present empirical evidence on how much credibility contributes to anchoring 
inflation  expectations  to  the  target  in  the  case  of  emerging  economies,  a  simple,  but 
elucidative framework is adopted. In contrast with previous studies, this analysis builds a 
bridge  between  the  rule  for  inflation  expectations  originally  proposed  by  Bonfim  and 
Rudebusch  (2000)  and  a  time-varying  credibility  index  originally  proposed  by  de 
Mendonça  (2007)  and  de  Mendonça  and  Galveas  (2013).  This  framework  has  solid 
underpinnings  because  the  rule  for  inflation  expectations  is  a  benchmark  for  several 
studies  (e.g.  Neuenkirch  and  Tillmann,  2014;  and  Tesfaselassie  and  Schaling,  2010), 
while the credibility index is already applied in several studies for emerging economies 
(e.g. Montes et al., 2016; Ciro and de Mendonça, 2016; Levieuge, Lucotte, and Ringuedé, 
2015;  and  Doğan  and  Bozdemir,  2014).  The  economic  data,  including  inflation 
expectations,  is  gathered  from  seven  central  banks  of  the  emerging  inflation  targeting 
economies under analysis (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, and 
Turkey). 

The  evidence  presented  in  this  study  indicates  that  the  adoption  of  inflation 
targeting in emerging economies does not represent a framework able to anchor inflation 
expectations. Although, credibility is relevant to reduce inflation expectations, the lack of 
commitment of central banks in emerging economies with the inflation targets denotes 
that  the  backward-looking  behavior  is  predominant  for  the  formation  of  inflation 
expectations. This paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a performance 
of  monetary  policy  credibility  for  the  countries  under  analysis  through  a  time-varying 
index.  Section  3  presents  evidence  on  how  much  credibility  associated  with  inflation 
targets helps to anchor inflation expectations.  Section 4 presents empirical evidence in 
order  to  observe  whether  monetary  policy  credibility  is,  in  fact,  relevant  to  the 
determination of inflation expectations. The last section presents the conclusion. 
 

2. Monetary policy credibility performance 

 

It  is  well-accepted  that  credibility  may  be  measured  by  the  difference  between 
public inflation expectations regarding the target. This view matches pretty well with the 
classical definition of credibility made by Cukierman and Meltzer (1986, p. 1180) - “(...) 
the  absolute  value  of  the  difference  between  the  policymaker’s  plans  and  the  public’s 
beliefs about those plans.” The same is still valid in Blinder’s (2000, p. 1422) words: “A 
central bank is credible if people believe it will do what it says.” Therefore, in practice, 
this definition means to observe how inflation expectations are close to the target over 
time.  

Since  inflation  expectations  represent  a  key  element  in  the  analysis  regarding 
credibility, the first  step  is  to  get the information that is  made  available  by  the central 
banks. This is not a simple task because even after adoption of inflation targeting most 
central  banks  in  emerging  economies  do  not  present  time  series  about  inflation 
expectations.  Even  in  the  case  of  central  banks  that  have  inflation  expectations  series, 

 

3 

most of these expectations are available only for the short-term horizon (current  year). 
This  is  a  problem  because  the  use  of  information  regarding  the  current  year  does  not 
permit checking whether inflation target is anchoring expectations or not. Of course the 
use of longer horizons represents the “first best” in this analysis, however, due to the lack 
of information, this study is constrained to consider only information on medium-term 
(one year ahead). In this context, constrained by available information from central banks, 
this analysis is based on quarterly data (see table 1) of the following inflation targeting 
emerging  economies:  Brazil,  Chile,  Colombia,  Mexico,  Poland,  South  Africa,  and 
Turkey.

Africa,  and  Turkey.  *  This  study  assumes  as  the  beginning  of  this  series  the  adoption  of  full-fledge  inflation 
targeting in Turkey. EINF is the mean of the expected rate of inflation over next 4 quarters. INF is the inflation 
measured  by  Consumer  Price  Index  -  in  4  quarters  (exception  is  Brazil  that  uses  the  National  Consumer  Price 
Index). 

 

All countries under consideration in this study make use of tolerance intervals in 
the inflation targeting system. The use of this mechanism is because monetary policy is 
conducted under uncertainty (unforeseen events) which can imply inflation to overshoot 
or  undershoot  the  target.  Furthermore,  central  banks  can  use  a  deliberate  strategy  to 
stabilize the economy. However, systematic and large deviations from the inflation target 
erode credibility. In addition, the use of large tolerance intervals impairs the formation of 
inflation  expectations.  In  case  of  the  lack  of  reliability,  inflation  public  expectations 
incorporate the upper bound of the interval, which results in more time to achieve price 
stability. 

Figure 1 shows how inflation expectations are close to the target and if they are 
inside  the  tolerance  intervals  over  time.  In  general,  it  is  observed  that  inflation 
expectations, with the exception of Chile and Poland, have been persistently above the 
target. Furthermore, in all cases there are periods where inflation expectations exceed the 
tolerance intervals. In particular, it seems that the strong international crisis 2007/08 was 
responsible for this observation in most cases.

publicly announced target for some variable x (x = inflation, say), then the gap between 
the target and market expectations can be taken as an objective measure of credibility.” 
Based  on  this  idea,  the  literature  offers  several  indices  that  takes  into  account  the 
magnitude of the difference between the public inflation expectations and the inflation 
target  (credibility  is  high when there exists convergence between  expectations  and the 
target). 

Cecchetti and Krause (2002) proposed a well-known index. This index indicates 
maximum credibility when the inflation expectation is equal to or less than the target. In 
contrast, the index denotes no credibility when inflation expectations exceed 20%. After 
this limit, the authors assume that the monetary authority loses the control over inflation. 
In this framework, credibility decreases as inflation expectations deviates from the target 
and approaches 20%. 

In the strand of the empirical analysis with credibility indices, similar to Bonfim 
and Rudebusch (2000),  Bordo and Siklos (2016) build a central  bank credibility index 
that takes into consideration the deviation of inflation expectations and the time-varying 
inflation target. Moreover, the authors assume ±1% interval around the inflation target. 
The  authors  consider  that  the  loss  of  credibility  is  greater  when  expectations  miss  the 
target outside the interval. 

The above-mentioned indices are a good representation of the empirical literature 
on central bank credibility. However, they fall short for an analysis concerning credibility 
in  inflation  targeting  in  emerging  economies.  Cecchetti  and  Krause’s  (2002)  index 
considers the unreal limit of 20% for a central bank not to have credibility. It is important 
to highlight that the adoption of inflation targeting is clearly a commitment by the central 
bank in an attempt to keep the inflation at acceptable levels (normally an inflation lower 
than  two  digits).  Furthermore,  this  index  attributes  maximum  credibility  when  the 
expected  inflation  is  lower  than  the  target.  This  assumption  is  not  acceptable  because 
some emerging economies as, for example that of Poland, have  experienced deflation, 
which in turn, obviously is a problem. The index presented by Bordo and Siklos (2016) 
has as an essential component a target range of ±1%. This is a drawback because it is not 
reasonable simply  to neglect  the inflation  intervals  that are announced  by  each central 
bank. The inflation intervals are part of the inflation targeting system in most countries. 
In order to analyze monetary policy credibility performance in inflation targeting 
emerging economies, a good index must comprehend its framework: (i) how the expected 
inflation for at least one year ahead converges to the announced target for the same period; 
(ii) whether inflation expectations are inside or outside of the tolerance intervals stated 
by  the  central  bank;  (iii)  the  use  of  information  that  is  available  from  central  banks 
(economic  transparency);  (iv)  the  presentation  of  the  outcome  is  intuitive;  (v)  that  it 
permits  the  time  series  of  the  index  being  up-to-date;  (vi)  easy  to  compute;  and  (vii) 
proven as a successful application for the case of inflation targeting emerging economies. 
 
A time-varying monetary credibility index that fits well for this analysis is that 
introduced  by  de  Mendonça  (2007)  and  de  Mendonça  and  Galveas  (2013).  The  index 
proposed by these authors fills  up all points mentioned above  and, in  particular,  it has 
already  been  used in  applications for  several emerging  economies.2  In brief,  the index 
makes use of the public’s forward-looking behavior on inflation and represents a useful 
tool for measuring the public’s trust vis-à-vis the ability of the central bank to achieve the 

                                                 
2 As examples of the use of this credibility index, see Montes et al. (2016); Ciro and de Mendonça (2016); 
Levieuge, Lucotte, and Ringuedé (2015); de Mendonça and Tostes (2015); Doğan and Bozdemir, (2014); 
Salle, Senegas, and Yildizoglu (2013); Montes (2013); Khemiri and Ali (2012); Montes and Tiberto (2012);

inflation  target.  In  specific,  credibility  is  maximum  (CRED=1)  when  the  inflation 
) is exactly the inflation target 4 quarters 
expectations for the next 4 quarters (

ahead (
stated  by  the  central  bank 

). In the case where the inflation exceeds the limits of the tolerance interval 
,  credibility  is  null  (CRED=0). 

Furthermore, the index assumes a value between 0 and 1 when inflation expectations are 
inside  the  interval 
and  decreases  as  expectations  deviate  from 

the target. Hence, the scale of the index is from 0 to 1, and it is a result of:

Figure  2  shows  the  performance  of  monetary  credibility  index  for  the  seven 
emerging economies under analysis. In general, figure 2 shows that the performance of 
the monetary policy credibility of the countries in the analysis was not good. The average 
credibility index for all countries is 0.34. The positive highlight is the Chilean economy 
(average of 0.7).  Brazil and Colombia have an intermediate position (average credibility 
is  0.47  and  0.44,  respectively)  but  the  index  presents  a  clear  deterioration  in  the  last 
period.  Although  Mexico  presents  a  trend  of  improvement  in  the  index  over  time,  the 
average is low (0.24). Negative highlights are Poland, Turkey, and South Africa (average 
credibility  index  is  0.19,  0.18,  and  0.14,  respectively).  This  result  is  particularly 
interesting because it reveals that while Turkey and South Africa fight against inflation 
expectations  greater  than  the  upper  bound,  Poland  has  the  opposite  situation  (inflation 
expectations lower than the lower bound). At the end, it is possible to see that all countries 
present a good performance in some moments however, with the exception of Chile, they 
are not able to maintain this level.

The relation between credibility and inflation expectations anchor 
 

 
Taking into account the convergence of inflation expectations to inflation target, 
the  effect  of  the  monetary  credibility  can  be  analyzed  through  a  convex  combination 
between the inflation target four quarters ahead (
) and the distributed lag of past 

inflation  in  the  last  four  quarters 

.  In  this 

framework, credibility is the weight of the inflation target in the determination of inflation 
expectations and the lack of credibility is the weight of past inflation rates. Hence, making 
some  adaptations  in  a  simple  rule  for  inflation  expectations  that  is  common  in  the 
literature  (see  Bonfim  and  Rudebusch,  2000;  Tesfaselassie  and  Schaling,  2010;  and 
Neuenkirch and Tillman, 2014), the reduced form approach is based on: 

(2) 

. 

 
The  interpretation  of  the  equation  above  is  straightforward,  in  the  case  of  full 
credibility (CRED=1) the term regarding past inflation is not relevant and thus inflation 
expectations are completely anchored to the inflation target. In contrast, when there is no 
credibility (CRED=0) inflation target is not relevant and thus inflation expectations is a 
result  of  past  inflation.  When  there  exists  credibility,  but  it  is  not  maximum  (that  is, 
0<CRED<1), inflation expectations are a result of the combination of both inflation target 
and past inflation. In brief, this framework permits observing how much of the inflation 
expectations  is  explained  by  the  inflation  target  and  the  past  inflation  considering  the 
credibility effect. 
 
Although the above idea is compelling, the main challenge is how to introduce a 
measure of credibility in equation (2).  However, this is not a problem if the credibility 
index introduced in the previous (CRED) section is used. Besides the advantages of using 
the credibility index (see equation 1), the fact that the index has a score between 0 and 1, 
that  is  [0,1],  maintains  the  intuition  of  equation  (2).  Therefore,  the  credibility  index 
(CRED) is a perfect match to be applied in this framework. 

With  information  on  inflation  expectations,  inflation  target,  inflation,  and 
credibility in hand, almost everything is ready for the analysis. The inconvenience is the 
lack of information regarding the coefficients on past inflation (a1, a2, a3, and a4). In order 
to  overcome this situation, equation (2) is  rewritten  in  a manner that the  estimation  of 
parameters through Ordinary Least Squares can be generated. Therefore,  

(3) 

. 

Now,  it  is  easy  to  obtain  the  parameters  (a1,  a2,  a3,  and  a4)  from  the  equation 
 
above.  After  finding  the  parameters,  it  is  possible  to  build  the  time  series  on  inflation 
expectations from equation (2). Figure 3 shows the result of this application for the seven 
countries  under  analysis.  The  graphs  suggest  that  the  inflation  expectations  computed 
through equation (2) represent  a good approximation  to those gathered from survey of 
expectations of each central bank. 

Although inflation expectations obtained from equation (2) seem well-adjusted to 
inflation expectations available from the central banks, the quality of the forecast needs 
to be checked. With this objective, the forecast error (FE) is computed as a result of the 
difference  between  the  inflation  expectations  for  the  next  four  quarters  gathered  from 
central banks (Et(INFt+4)) and the forecast of the expectations (
) computed 

from equation (2), that is:

Therefore, it allows one to see if the inflation expectations from equation (2) are prone to 
overestimation  or  to  underestimation  of  the  inflation  expectations  from  central  banks. 
Furthermore,  Mean  Error  (ME)  and  Mean  Absolute  Error  (MAE)  are  presented  as 
statistics  regarding  the  quality  of  the  forecasts.  The  average  of  the  forecast  errors  (ME) 
denotes magnitude and direction of the projections while MAE is related to the accuracy of 
the forecasts. These statistics are computed as follows: 

(5) 

  

and 

 

, 

where: n is the number of observations. 

In  addition  to  ME  and  MAE,  figure  4  also  includes  a  test  for  unbiasedness  and 

efficiency by estimating: 
(6)      

,  

where:  and β are unknown parameters, and  is the error term.  

 

According to Holden and Peel (1990), a sufficient condition for 

 to 

be  an  unbiased  forecast  of 

  is  that  =0  and  β=1.  Moreover,  a  test  for 

autocorrelation  (existence  of  some  degree  of  persistence)  through  lagrange  multiplier 
(LM) test is applied to detect autocorrelation in the residuals. 
 
The results in figure 4 indicate that, with the exception of Colombia and Mexico, 
the  projections  making  use  of  equation  (2)  underestimate  the  inflation  expectations  from 
central banks (positive forecast error). However, the results of the statistics and tests indicate 
that the use of equation (2) to forecast inflation expectations has good quality. In all countries, 
MAE is lower than 1, and the unbiasedness and autocorrelation tests approved the efficiency 
of the forecasts. 
 
Since inflation expectations obtained from equation (2) represent a good proxy for 
inflation expectations made available from the central banks, it is possible to observe how 
the interaction between inflation target and credibility explains the expectations. In this 
context,  figure  5  shows  the  decomposition  of  inflation  expectations  as  computed  from 
equation (2). Therefore, it is possible to see whether inflation expectations are a result of 
a backward-looking process. In other words, this case would represent a situation where 
the  lack  of  credibility  implies  that  the  past  inflation  determines  the  expectations.  In 
contrast, if the credibility is maximum there is a perfect convergence of expectations to 
the inflation target, and thus, the central bank has the power to anchor expectations.

With  the  exception  of  Chile,  which 
presents a very good performance in anchoring inflation expectations, the other countries 
present a frustrating performance. The cases of Poland, Turkey, and South Africa, show 
that  only  in  very  few  periods  did  inflation  targets  associated  with  credibility  have  the 
ability to contribute to the formation of inflation expectations. Colombia and Brazil did 
not present a very bad performance over time. However, the problem, especially in the 
Brazilian case, is that the central banks reduced the attention on inflation and the result is 
a  deterioration  in  expectations  in  the  last  period.  In  contrast,  Mexico  seems  to  be 
improving  the  central  bank’s  commitment  with  inflation  target  and  the  result  is  an 
increasing ability to anchor expectations. 
 

4. Impact of credibility on inflation expectations 

 

Until the previous section, this analysis assumed a rule presented in equation (2) 
 
for  inflation  expectations.  However,  it  is  possible  that  credibility  does  not  have  a 
significant role in the determination of expectations. In order to observe if the monetary 
policy credibility is, in fact, relevant to inflation expectations, this section presents OLS 
estimations for inflation expectations based on two variations of equation (2). One model 
) and the average of 
which considers the inflation target four quarters ahead (

past inflation in the last four quarters (
(7) 

,  

), that is: 

and other model which takes into account the credibility effect on inflation expectations 
through an interactive term with inflation target (

) which corresponds to: 

(8) 

. 

 
The  models  above  permit  checking  if  the  introduction  of  the  credibility  in  the 
model improves the forecast of the inflation expectations. This can be observed through 
a  measure  of  accuracy  (root-mean-square  error  –  RMSE)  and  the  coefficient  of 
determination (adjusted R2) – see table 2. In the case where the model with the presence 
of the credibility (equation 8) implies a lower RMSE and a greater adjusted R2, there is an 
indication that the introduction of credibility improves the forecast. Furthermore, taking 
into consideration the usual case where inflation expectations are greater than inflation 
target,  a 1<0  means  that  credibility  contributes  to  decrease  inflation  expectations  and 
thus helps to the convergence to the target.

The  results  in  table  2  indicate  that  for  all  countries,  the  model  with  credibility 
presents better results (greater adjusted R2 and lower RMSE). In addition, 1 is negative 
and has statistical significance in all cases. Therefore, there exists evidence that credibility 
represents a good thing when the objective is to anchor inflation expectations. 
 

5. Conclusion 
 

 
This study presents an analysis of the effect of the monetary policy credibility on 
inflation  expectations  based  on  information  gathered  from  seven  inflation  targeting 
emerging  economies.  Through  the  use  of  a  simple  rule  for  determination  of  inflation 
expectations it was possible to identify which part of expectations is associated with the 
interaction of the credibility with the inflation target and the part that is associated with 
the interaction of the lack of credibility with past inflation. Furthermore, it was observed 
if  monetary  policy  credibility  is  relevant  to  improve  forecasts  regarding  inflation 
expectations. 
 
The findings in this study present a direct practical implication for the conduct of 
the  monetary  policy  in  emerging  economies  that makes  use  of  inflation  targeting.  The 
main observation is that only adopting inflation targeting is insufficient to anchor inflation 
expectations. Although all countries in this study announce inflation targets, the lack of 
commitment  of  the  central  banks  to  the  targets  is  unacceptable.  With  the  exception  of 
Chile, the emerging economies in this study are not able to maintain regularity in guiding 
inflation expectations to the inflation targets. The result is that the countries present low 
monetary credibility and, as a consequence, inflation expectations are determined in large 
measure by past inflation.  
What  should  be  done  to  reduce  the  lack  of  capacity  to  anchor  inflation 
 
expectations? Credibility is imperative for countries with inflation targeting. This is not 
magic but a result of the commitment of the central banks to the targets. The main mistake 
of central banks in emerging economies is that they try to achieve unreal inflation targets 
and to respond to shocks on the economy at the same time. Credibility is intrinsic to time, 
thus only one government or one central banker tenure, which is really committed to the 
inflation  target,  is  insufficient  to  establish  credibility.  Inflation  (or  deflation)  is  an 
incurable  disease.  Therefore,  it  demands  continuous  care.  It  is  necessary  to  create 
mechanisms that increase the commitment of the central bank to the targets and to avoid 
governments using the benefits of a burgeoning credibility, as appears to have happened 
in  Brazil.  At  last,  of  course  inflation  expectations  can  be  influenced  by  several  other 
variables  that  were  not  considered  in  this  study  and  thus  deserve  attention  in  future 
research  on  this  subject.  However,  the  results  presented  show  an  unquestionable 
relevance  of  the  monetary  policy  credibility  on  inflation  expectations  in  emergent 
economies.
