Abstract 
 
  This  article  analyses  the  effect  that  labor  turnover  had  on  the  productivity  of 
Brazilian manufacturing firms between 1996 and 2013. We based our analysis in a 
theory  of  learning  by  doing,  where  turnover  harm  productivity  by  restricting 
efficiency  gains  achieved  by  workers  via  the  accumulation  of  learning  that  results 
from  the  act  of  producing  in  the  same  firm.  We  estimate  a  learning  measurement 
that takes into account the loss of human capital—resulting from turnover—and its 
effect on total factor productivity (TFP). Our learning measurement is shown to be 
robust  and  has  a  consistent  positive  relationship  with  three  different  estimates  of 
TFP.

 Introduction 

 
Historically, a predominant feature in the Brazilian job market has been its high 
turnover rate. In international comparisons, it is often concluded that Brazil has  one of 
the  highest  rates  of  job  turnover  among  countries  with  available  measures  (Gonzaga, 
2003).  

 
The  first  decade  of  the  2000s  was  marked  by  the  sound  performance  of  the 
economy and the job market, with an increase in the formalization of employment and a 
decreasing trend for unemployment rates (Corseuil and Foguel, 2011). In addition  the 
increase in labor force educational level that took place in the 90’s continued during the 
2000’s.  Despite  all  these  improvements  in  labor  market,  there  was    an  increase  in  the 
turnover rate in this period and stagnation of labor productivity (IPEA, 2012).  

 
Accordingly,  the  high  rate  of  job  turnover  has  been  indicated  as  a  cap  to  the 
growth of labour productivity in Brazil (Gonzaga, 2014; Corseuil et al., 2013). To some 
extent, the reason is that high turnover is associated with low levels of commitment and 
investment  in  professional  training,  both  by  workers  and  by  firms,  with  consequences 
for labor productivity.  

 
The  main  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  understand  the  consequences  that  high 
turnover has for the economy through its effects on labor productivity. To that end, we 
estimate a learning measurement that captures the loss of human capital resulting from 
turnover.  

 
The  international  literature  indicates  several  determinants  for  productivity 
growth, and among them is the effect of learning. According to the concept of “learning 
by  doing”,  the  more  a  worker  produces,  the  more  he  accumulates  experience,  thus 
becoming more efficient in performing his task (Wright, 1936; Arrow, 1962). However, 
as observed by Argote et al. (1990), learning is not accumulated constantly and equally 
among  firms—there  is  the  possibility  that  knowledge  will  suffer  a  type  of 
“depreciation”.  Chiang  (2004)  adopts  the  idea  of  learning  depreciation;  however, 
instead  of  estimating  a  depreciation  rate—something  that  the  author  considered  to  be 
abstract—a  more  explicit  measure  is  used:  turnover.  The  basic  idea  is  that  the 
productivity  of  a  firm  is  a  function  of  the  learning  acquired  over  time  by  all  of  its 
employees.  Therefore,  firms  with  high  labor  turnover  will  have  more  difficulty  in 
accumulating knowledge and, consequently, in increasing their productivity. 

 
Due to the importance of labor productivity growth for economic development, 
the idea is to contribute to this topic by analyzing the relationship between the learning 
acquired in production and labor productivity at micro level.   

 

1.  Turnover, human capital, and learning by doing 

One  of  the  consequences  of  the  labor  turnover  is  the  loss  of  the  experience 
accumulated by firms. Basically, this occurs because the individuals participation in the 
productive  process  hold  the  experience  and,  when  they  leave  their  job,  the  knowledge 
accumulated  is  lost.  In  particular,  the  firm  will  lose  knowledge  if  the  worker  who  left 
the  firm  has  accumulated  specific  capital  during  his  time  working  in  the  job  (Becker, 
1993). 

Thompson  (2007)  cites  three  explanations  for  understanding  the  occurrence  of 
knowledge  depreciation  in  the  productive  process:  (i)  when  a  technological  change 
occurs in production, past experience becomes irrelevant; (ii) organizations often fail in 
the process of recalling experiences because they have imperfect or inadequate memory 
systems; and (iii) tacit knowledge passed to employees is lost when they leave the job. 
Considering these explanations, only the third can be subjected to direct testing. 

 

1.1. Turnover and human capital 

The  Theory  of  Human  Capital  (Schultz,  1961;  Becker,  1962;  Becker,  1993) 
shows  that  productivity  depends  on  the  qualification  of  the  labor  force,  which  are 
largely  a  function  of  an  individual’s  education  level.  In  this  function,  another 
fundamental  variable  for  explaining  productivity  is  the  specific  human  capital 
accumulated  through  training  in  the  work  environment.  Therefore,  the  knowledge  and 
skills of an individual, innate or acquired, determine his productivity. 

Schoolling  enables 

that  will  be 
complemented  by  the  specific  knowledge  acquired  by  the  individual  throughout  his 
active  life.  This  specific  knowledge  can,  in  turn,  be  acquired  through    on  the  job 
experience and training or through specialization courses. 

the  acquisition  of  general  knowledge 

Investment  in  human  capital  can  be  undertaken  by  the  firm  itself;  however,  it 
tends  to  be  specific  training.  ,  In  this  sense,  the  on  the  job  training    generates  a  firm 
specific  skill,  minimizing  the  transference  of  skills  and  the  possibility  that  those  who 
have  been  trained  will  leave  the  firm.  If  turnover  is  high,  then  investments  in  specific 
human  capital  becomes  unviable.  After  all,  firm’s  investiments  on  training  tend  to  be 
more feasible when employee remains longer in the job.  

In  the  traditional  model  of  human  capital,  wages  reflect  the  worker’s 
productivity,  which  depends  on  the  stock  of  human  capital.  One  of  the  hypotheses  is 
that time at work is also an investment in human capital, in which skills can be acquired 
as  a  by-product  of  the  work  (learning  by  doing)  or  through  specific  training  during 
working hours (on-the-job training) (Heckman, Lochner, and Cossa, 2002). 

Several studies have indicated that productivity will be a function of the learning 
acquired  on  the  job  over  time.  Guthrie  (2001)  examine  the  relationship  between 
employee  retention  and  corporate  productivity.  The  results  of  this  author’s  study 
indicate a positive association between the  firms that retain their employees for longer 
periods  of  time  and  their  productivities,  particularly  for  firms  that  have  a  higher 
commitement level of production’s workers. Therefore, the basic idea is that firms with 
high labor turnover will face more difficulties to increase their productivity. 

In a review of the Mincerian approach, Heckman et al. (2006) draw attention to 
a more general model formulated by Mincer (1974), in which returns on experience may 
be  different  among  individuals.  One  method  of  characterizing  this  heterogeneity  is  to 
observe the average return for experience in different groups. The authors show that the 
return on experience occurs heterogeneously between different groups of schooling.  

Gathmann and Schonberg (2010) use information on occupational tasks from the 
German  data  source  BIBB  to  create  a  unidimensional  measurement  of  domain  over 
tasks. Accordingly, they propose the concept of task-specific human capital and include 

this measurement in the wage equation. Their conclusion is that more than 50% of wage 
growth  is  explained  by  this  measurement  and,  furthermore,  it  increases  with 
occupational stability or imminent occupational movements. 

Yamaguchi (2012) estimates a structural model of heterogeneous human capital 
using  a  Kalman  filter.  The  results  from  this  author’s  estimation  indicate  that  workers 
employed  in  occupations  with  more  complex  tasks  have  faster  growth  in  skill. 
Additionally,  the  results  also  show  that  cognitive  skills  play  a  central  role  in  wage 
growth. 

 

1.2. Learning by Doing 

 
Arrow  (1962)  assumes  that  the  accumulation  of  knowledge,  or  human  capital, 
arises  from  learning  by  doing.  The  argument  used  is  that  learning  is  the  product  of 
practical  experience,  which  is  acquired  during  the  production  process,  in  which  the 
worker  will  be  exposed  to  challenges  and  the  possibility  of  trying  to  solve  problems. 
Thus,  it  is  possible  to  develop  the  production  process  through  the  production  process 
itself,  and  therefore,  the  increase  in  productivity  of  the  economy  may  be  derived from 
the amount of experience acquired in the elaboration of a particular product or process. 

 
The  process  known  in  the  literature  as  “learning  by  doing”  occurs  through  the 
investment that each firm makes in its productive process. This formulation is based on 
the  hypothesis  that  costs  are  a  decreasing  function  of  accumulated  production.  The 
fundamentals of this formulation have been confirmed in the international literature by 
empirical studies over the years.  

 
Traditional  models  of  learning  by  doing  considered  the  accumulation  of 
experience  that  generates  learning  is  given  by  the  accumulation  of  production  (or 
investment)  over  time.  Preston  and  Keachie  (1964)  find  that  both  the  costs  of  each 
product  unit  and  the  costs  of  labor  decreases  with  the  accumulation  of  production. 
Rapping  (1965)  shows  that  the  observed  increase  in  production  over  time  (during  a 
process of production accumulation) is not simply due to the increase in the insertion of 
labor and/or capital, the increase in the exploitation of economies of scale, or the mere 
passage  of  time.  The  author  finds  convincing  evidences  of  the  occurrence  of 
productivity gains through learning at the organizational level. 

Therefore, according to  the traditional models, if, given the same technological 
 
conditions,  there  are  no  differences  in  the  initial  productivity  of  two  firms  and,  over 
time, the productivity of these two firms remains the same, then it can be assumed that 
the  production  decisions  (and/or  investment)  were  identical.  Thus,  productivity 
differences  would  occur  because  the  firms  have  different  production  (or  investment) 
decisions or simply because some firms are older or newer than others. However, these 
models do not seem to be very consistent with reality because they do not consider the 
possibility of losses in the stock of knowledge.  

 
Unlike the “traditional” models, the newer models have admitted the possibility 
that  experience  gains  will  not  occur  perpetually.  The  new  models  introduce  the 
hypothesis  that  there  is  a  certain  rate  of  “depreciation”  or  “forgetting”  of  the  stock  of 
knowledge.  Argote  et  al.  (1990)  find  results  indicating  that  the  learning  acquired 

through production depreciates rapidly, which therefore shows that the results obtained 
through the traditional models had been overestimated. 

 
Some  important  studies  have  been  published  in  recent  years  emphasizing    the 
experience  acquired  over  productivity  gains  in  various  sectors  of  activity  (Benkard, 
2000;  Chiang,  2004;  Thompson,  2007;  Brachet  and  David,  2011;  Levitt,  List,  and 
Syverson, 2012).  

 
Benkard  (2000)  analyzes  commercial  aircraft  production,  with  an  emphasis  on 
production  dynamics  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  The  author  uses  a  learning  by  doing 
model  and  finds  evidence  that  learning  is  determined  stochastically  rather  than 
deterministically. Therefore, he notes that during the execution process, the worker can 
internalize  or  not  the  knowledge,  and  can  alsoforget  a  portion  of  the  acquired 
knowledge. Thus, he introduces the hypothesis of organizational “forgetting”, in which 
the accumulated experience of firms depreciates over time. 

 
Analyzing  data  from  the  manufacturing  sector  of  the  United  States,  Chiang 
(2004)  shows  that  learning  is  affected  not  only  by  past  production  but  also  by  the 
worker turnover rate within firms. The author uses the hypothesis that firms with high 
turnover  rates  have  greater  difficulty  in  retaining  learning  by  doing.  Based  on  this 
assumption, the author estimates that firms with a history of low turnover “learn” faster 
than those with a history of high turnover, given the same amounts of production. 

 
New  estimates  for  rates  of  organizational  “forgetting”  are  provided  by 
Thompson (2007). Using data from shipbuilding in the United States during World War 
II,  the  author  achieves  more  modest  results  than  the  literature  indicate  for  the  rates  of 
forgetting.  In  cases  in  which  learning  was  limited,  this  effect  might  not  even  have 
existed. By  including in  his  model the  effects  of  the turnover rate of firms, the author 
also diverges from the literature by not finding significant results concerning the effects 
of turnover on learning and, consequently, on productivity. 

 
In line with Chiang (2004), Brachet and David (2011) find robust estimates that 
the  high  turnover  of  ambulance  companies  in  Michigan  (USA)  increases  the  levels  of 
organizational  “forgetting”.  The  authors  test  two  effects:  (1)  the  turnover  rate  and  (2) 
the  possible  skill  losses  of  workers  who  remain  in  the  job.  The  results  show  that  the 
effects of the former are twice the magnitude of the latter. 

  

2.  Databases and methodology 

 
2.1.  Databases 

 
Two databases are used in this study. The first is the Annual Social Information 
Report  (Relação  Anual  de  Informações  Sociais  -  RAIS)  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and 
Employment (Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego - MTE), and the second is the Annual 
Industrial  Survey  (Pesquisa  Industrial  Anual  -  PIA)  of  the  Brazilian  Institute  of 
Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística - IBGE).  

The  RAIS  is  an  administrative  record  requested  from  legal  entities  and  other 
 
formalized employers, with information about the characteristics of the  employees and 
the job in the base year. As this base is a census of formal employees and employers, it 

represents enormous potential for analyzing the formal job market at the national level. 
The data available enable a series of analytical cross-sections to be made, according to 
aspects  such  as:  geographical  region,  economic  sector,  occupation,  gender,  level  of 
schooling,  and  age  group,  among  others.  The  data  refer  to  information  on  jobs, 
establishments, turnover, and remuneration. 

 
At its most disaggregated level, the RAIS provides data for each worker. At this 
level, we obtain data related to the human capital of workers, for example: age, level of 
education,  and  remuneration.  The  data  are  then  aggregated  by  firms  to  obtain  the 
indicators related to the characteristics of the firms. At this level, only firms that operate 
in the industrial sector will be filtered to continue in the database to be compatible with 
the IBGE’s Annual Industrial Survey (PIA). 

 
The  PIA  identifies  the  basic  structural  characteristics  of  the  business  sector  of 
the industrial activity at the national level, and it is conducted on an annual basis. The 
survey presents data on employees, costs and expenses, revenue, production value, and 
the value of the industrial transformation, among others. The industrial classification is 
performed based on version  2.01 of the National Classification of Economic Activities 
(Classificação Nacional de Atividades Econômicas - CNAE). 

 
The  two  databases,  aggregated  at  the  firm  level,  are  interlinked  by  means  of  a 
unique identifier. The key variable that makes it possible to link the two databases is the 
National  Registry  of  Legal  Entities  (Cadastro  Nacional  de  Pessoa  Jurídica  -  CNPJ). 
After they are linked, we obtain an unbalanced panel of firms for the 1996-2013 period. 
It  is  worth  noting  that  the  merging  of  the  databases  was  performed  within  a 
confidentiality  room  of  the  IBGE  and  that  all  rules  of  statistical  confidentiality  were 
respected. 

 
The  monetary  variable  of  the  PIA  used  to  calculate  productivity  (added  value) 
was  deflated  by  the  Global  Supply  Wholesale  Price  Index  (Índice  de  Preços  por 
Atacado-Oferta Global - IPA-OG) of the Getulio Vargas Foundation (Fundação Getulio 
Vargas  -  FGV),  the  three-digit  CNAE.  When  doing  so  was  not  possible,  the  two-digit 
deflator was applied. The  wage variable of the  RAIS was deflated using the Extended 
Consumer Price Index (Índice de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo - IPCA), calculated by 
the IBGE. 

 

2.2. Methodology 
 

2.2.1. Definition and measurement of turnover 

The  concept  of  labor  turnover  is  often  associated  to  the  substitution  of  one 
worker by another in the same job., The empirical counterpart of this concept is usually 
measured using the following formula: 

𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 (𝑡𝑟) =  

𝑚𝑖𝑛 (ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠;𝑠𝑒𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠)

 𝑗𝑜𝑏𝑠

 x 100 

                                                           
1Version 1.0 of the CNAE was released from 1996 to 2007. The changeover to version 2.0 occurred after 
2007. This changeover required a conversion of the sectorial classification of CNAE 1.0 to CNAE 2.0 in 
the years prior to 2007. 

In fact even a separation not driven by worker substitution will harm the learning 
by  doing  process  that  motivates  our  analysis.  Therefore,  an  additional  turnover 
measurement  is  used,  in  which  we  consider  any  separation.  This  is  calculated  as 
follows: 

𝑠𝑒𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 (𝑡𝑑)   =  

𝑠𝑒𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 

𝑗𝑜𝑏𝑠

 x 100 

The  separation  rate,  similar  to  the  turnover  rate,  is  calculated  at  the  firm  level, 

and afterwards, the two rates will be aggregated. 

TABLE 1. Turnover rate and separation rate, 1996-2013 

 

 

Table 1 shows the evolution, between 1996 and 2013, of the two rates calculated 
for  the  sample  analyzed  in  this  study.  The  turnover  rate  reached  49.5%  in  2013  and 
peaked  in  2008  at  64.1%.  The  separation  rate  was  67.9%  in  2013  and  had  its  peak  in 
1999,  when  it  reached  119.9%.  It  can  be  observed  that  the  turnover  rate  based  on  the 
concept of worker substitution induces a smoother time evolution.  

The trajectory of the turnover rate in the recent period shows that it remained at 
levels between 37 and 45% between 1996 and 2007 and that, after reaching its peak in 
2008 and decreasing slightly in 2009 due to the effects of the international crisis, From 
2010 onward, the turnover rate remained at a higher levels, between 48 and 52%. 

The separation  rate has  a  greater variance in  its  evolution and higher levels.  In 

years of economic crisis, as in 2008 and 1999-2000, the rate surpassed 100%. 

2.2.2. Learning measurement 

 
In  traditional  learning  models,  the  empirical  counterpart  of  the  contribution  of 
experience accumulation to productivity growth is simply defined as accumulated past 
production.  In  more recent  models,    the possibility that this learning may  suffer  from 
“depreciation”  or  “forgetting”  is  incorporated.  The  departure  point  for  these  models  is 
the following  definition of learning, based on the accumulation of experience: 

YearTurnover rateSeparation rate199642.978.4199744.587.7199837.685.3199937.7119.9200044,0106.8200142.890.7200238.275.4200338.179.8200440.171,0200541.883.7200641.778.7200745.790.3200864.1116.9200943.984.6201052,095.7201153.792.6201248.166.6201349.567.9Source: RAIS (MTE) 𝐸𝑖𝑡 =  𝛿𝑡(𝐸𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝑞𝑖𝑡−1)  

 

           

   (3) 

where 𝐸𝑖𝑡 is the experience accumulated by the firm in production  until the beginning 
of  year  t,  and  𝐸𝑖𝑡−1  is  the  experience  accumulated  until  the  beginning  of  the 
immediately  preceding  year.  The  term  𝑞𝑖𝑡−1  is  the  production  of  the  firm  in  t-1  (also 
measured  in  GPV).  The  “depreciation”  of  the  learning  is  represented  by   𝛿𝑡,  which  is 
bounded  between  0  and  1.  Note  that  we  allow  for  time  variation  in  the  depreciation, 
which  contrasts  with  a  standard  assumption  of  fixed  rate  of  depreciation  in  models  of 
(physical) capital accumulation.  

In  this  article,  a  direct  measurement  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  the  time  varying  rate  of 
depreciation—as  noted  above,  this  measurement  is  the  turnover  rate  (tr).  Thus,  we 
follow Chiang (2004) in using the following measure for experience accumulation: 

𝐸𝑖𝑡 = (1 − 𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑡−1)(𝐸𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝑞𝑖𝑡−1) 

 

 

 

(4) 

Ii one extreme case, if in a period t a firm decides to replace all of its employees, 
 
then its turnover rate will be equal to 1. In this case, all of its specific human capital will 
be  lost;  that  is,  its  learning  measurement  will  be  equal  to  zero.  However,  if  the  firm 
maintains  the  same  employees,  then  its  turnover  rate  will  equal  zero,  and  therefore, 
there will be no learning losses due to “depreciation”. 

Additionally,  in  an  attempt  to  capture  the  effect  that  any  departure  of  workers  has  on 
firms,  we  use  a  learning  measurement  that  uses  the  separation  rate  (sr)  instead  of  the 
turnover rate for depreciation: 

𝐸𝑖𝑡 = (1 − 𝑡𝑑𝑖𝑡−1)(𝐸𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝑞𝑖𝑡−1) 

 

 

 

(5) 

 
The  data  on  separations,  hirings,  and  jobs,  in  addition  to  the  calculation  of  the 
turnover  rate  and  the  separation  rate,  are  obtained  from  RAIS  data.  After  being 
aggregated at the firm level, the RAIS data are linked to the PIA data, also at the firm 
level, and accordingly, we obtain the data on production, , so that we can estimate the 
final model. 

2.2.3. General human capital indicator 

 
The  learning  measurement  described  in  this  work  can  be  defined  succinctly  as 
the sum of the human capital acquired in the course of the firm’s production process. As 
noted above, the human capital of the worker can be divided into general human capital 
and specific human capital. The first type is that acquired by the worker throughout his 
life (education, life experience, etc.), whereas the second type is that acquired within the 
firm.  

 
The  objective  of  this  work  is  to  observe  how  variations  in  learning  affect  the 
productivity  level  of  firms.  To  that  end,  one  challenge  is  to  be  able  to  isolate  specific 
human capital from general human capital. Abowd, Lengermann, and McKinney (2005) 
and Chiang (2004) estimate human capital via the following model: 

                                              𝑤𝑎𝑖𝑡 =   𝑥𝑎𝑖𝑡𝛽 + 𝜑𝑖 + 𝜀𝑎𝑖𝑡   

 

 

       (1) 

The dependent variable is the log of the wage of individual a working in firm i 
 
in  year  t.  The  component  𝑥𝑎𝑖𝑡  represents  a  vector  of  the  individual  observed 
characteristics,  such  as  age  (measured  in  years),  and  schooling  level  (dummies).  The 

next  component, 𝜑𝑖,  represents  the  fixed  effect  of  the  firm,  and  the  last  term  is  the 
residual of the model. 

 
The  employee’s  wage  rate  is  given  by  the  sum  of  the  market  value  of  his 
personal  characteristics  and  the  employer’s  specific  remuneration  policies.  Some 
personal characteristics, such as experience in the job market, evolve over time, whereas 
others, such  as education and  some unobserved  component (such as  “ability”),  remain 
constant.  Stochastic  variations  in  these  personal  effects,  in  addition  to  the  effects  of 
firms, are ignored.  

The measurement of general human capital, which will call  h, is formed by the 
 
combination  of  the  observable  component  of  the  individuals  using  the  estimated 
parameters from equation 1 (𝛽̂). Thus, we have the following:

We  use  two  measurements  of  general  human  capital.  The  difference  between 
them is  in  the specification of the  education dummies. The first  is  aggregated into the 
following  categories:  Incomplete  Elementary  Education,  Incomplete  secondary 
education,  and  Completed  secondary  education.  The  alternative  measurement  is 
aggregated  into:  Incomplete  Elementary  Education,  Some  tertiary  Education,  and 
Completed tertiary education Education. The  second classification is  more affected by 
movements in tertiary education. 

 
We use the RAIS data at their most disaggregated level to obtain information on 
workers’  wages,  age,  and  educational  level.  The  estimates  are  obtained  at  the  worker 
level, and these are subsequently aggregated at the firm level to obtain the results from 
the main model.   

 

2.2.4. Total Factor Productivity 

 
For  the  productivity  measurement,  we  follow  the  approaches  conducted  by 
Messa  (2014)—who  calculates  the  Total  Factor  Productivity  (TFP)  using  econometric 
methods  applied  to  Brazilian  manufacturing  plant  level  data.  Starting  from  a  Cobb-
Douglas production function, such that the product (Y) of firm i at time t is a result of 
the combination of the capital (K) and labor (L) factors due to technology (A), we have 
the following: 

𝑌𝑡 = 𝐴𝑖𝑡𝐾𝑖𝑡

𝛽𝐾𝐿𝑖𝑡
𝛽𝐿 

 
The  TFP  calculation  can  be  performed  using  different  methodologies.  The 
following  three  estimates  that  are  commonly  utilized  in  the  literature  are  used:  (i) 
ordinary  least  squares,  (ii)  the  Olley-Pakes  method,  and  (iii)  the  Levinsohn-Petrin 
method.  The  description  below  closely  follows  the  corresponding  topics  in  Messa 
(2014). The TFP estimates are calculated based on the PIA data. 

i) 

Ordinary Least Squares 

 
The  simplest  method  of  obtaining  a  measurement  of  productivity  is  to  run  a 
simple regression via  ordinary  least  squares (OLS). The objective of this method is  to 
estimate the parameters  so that the deviations (error vector) between the observed and 
estimated  values  are  minimal.  Extracting  the  logarithm  from  the  production  function 
described above, we have the following: 

𝑦𝑖𝑡 =   𝛽0 + 𝛽𝐾𝑘𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 

 

 

    (6) 

 
The lowercase letters represent the natural logarithm of the respective variables, 
the  β’s  represent  the  parameters  to  be  estimated,  and  ε  is  the  error  term.  However, 
despite the simplicity of using this method, it may result in problems that would violate 
certain assumptions of the OLS method and would yield biased estimators. 

 
When  estimating  the  production  function,  the  error  term  (the  deviations  in 
relation to the mean) of the equation, which is being associated with the TFP, may also 
have  some  relationship  with  the  explanatory  variables.  This  problem,  known  as 
simultaneity,  harms  the  basic  assumptions  of  the  OLS  method.  To  overcome  these 
endogeneity problems of the OLS method, the literature presents some alternatives, for 
example, the methods of Olley-Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn-Petrin (2003). 

ii) 

Olley-Pakes Method 

The  measurement  proposed  by  Olley  and  Pakes  (1996)  estimates  a  production 
function  consistently,  considering  the  problem  of  endogeneity.  The  authors  use  an 
observable variable as a proxy for productivity. To be a good proxy, the chosen variable 
must be correlated as much as possible with productivity. The Olley-Pakes method uses 
the investment flow variable of firms as a proxy. 

Starting  from  (6),  we  can  divide  the  residual  into  two  parts:  𝜀𝑖𝑡 = 𝜔𝑖𝑡 + 𝜗𝑖𝑡,  in 
which 𝜔 is composed of unobservable characteristics that influence the decision of the 
firms  and  𝜗  is  the  idiosyncratic  shock.  From  the  results  found  in  Olley  and  Pakes 
(1996), the authors assume that 𝜔 is a stochastically increasing time sequence and that 
the investment flow can be written as i = f (𝜔𝑖𝑡, 𝑘𝑖𝑡), in which f is a monotonic function 
in 𝜔. Inverting f, we have 𝜔𝑖𝑡 = 𝑔(𝑖𝑖𝑡, 𝑘𝑖𝑡). Thus, (6) can be rewritten as follows: 

𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑡 + 𝜑(𝑖𝑖𝑡, 𝑘𝑖𝑡) + 𝜗𝑖𝑡 

 

 

 

(7) 

where:𝜑(𝑖𝑖𝑡, 𝑘𝑖𝑡) = 𝛽𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑡 + 𝑔(𝑖𝑖𝑡 + 𝑘𝑖𝑡) 

and  φ  can  be  estimated  by  a  third-order  polynomial.  Thus,  from  (7),  we  obtain  the 
̂ . To obtain the estimate of 𝛽𝑘, we rely on  innovation in productivity, based 
estimate 𝛽𝑙
on the last period expectation: 𝜁 = 𝜔𝑖𝑡 − 𝐸[𝜔𝑖𝑡|𝜔𝑖𝑡−1]. Thus, we rewrite (7) as follows: 

𝑦𝑖𝑡 − 𝛽𝑙

̂ 𝑙𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑡 + ℎ(𝜑𝑖𝑡−1̂ − 𝛽𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑡) + 𝜁𝑖𝑡 + 𝜗𝑖𝑡  

 

(8)  

From (8), we obtain a consistent estimate for 𝛽𝑘.  

iii) 

Levinsohn-Petrin Method 

To  overcome  the  problem  resulting  from  the  investment  flow  variable  used  in  the 
Olley-Pakes method, Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) propose another variable to be used 
as  a  proxy  for  productivity.  For  these  authors,  expenditures  with  intermediate  inputs 
would be more efficient for capturing the dynamics of productivity. 

The  first  stage  of  the  Levinsohn-Petrin  method  is  analogous  to  that  of  Olley  and 
Pakes (1996), described in (7). The only difference is the substitution of the variable i—
which  represents  the  investment  flows—with  the  variable  m,  which  represents  the 
̂ . 
intermediate costs, such that 𝑚𝑖𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑚𝑖𝑡, 𝑘𝑖𝑡). Thus, we obtain the estimate of 𝛽𝑙

For  the  second  stage,  any  candidate  𝛽𝑘

∗  is  used,  with  the  objective  of  computing  a 

predicted value for 𝜔𝑡for all periods t: 

𝜔𝑖𝑡̂ = 𝑦𝑖𝑡 − 𝛽𝑘

∗𝑘𝑖𝑡 − 𝛽̂

𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑡  

 

 

 

     (9) 

Using  the  values  obtained  in  (9),  a  consistent  (non-parametric)  approximation  for 

𝐸[𝜔𝑖𝑡|𝜔𝑖𝑡−1] is given through the predicted value of the regression. 

𝜔𝑡̂ = 𝛾0 + 𝛾1𝜔𝑡−1 + 𝛾2𝜔𝑡−1

2.2.5. Estimating the effects of learning on TFP 

 
The  aim  here  is  to  find  the  effects  of  the  turnover  rate  on  labor  productivity 
through learning. Therefore, to find the desired effect, according to Chiang (2004), the 
following equation is estimated: 

𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛾0 + 𝛾𝑗 + 𝛾𝑣𝑣𝑖 + 𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾ℎℎ𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖𝑗𝑡 

 

(12) 

prodijt is the measure of total factor productivity (TFP) of firm i in sector j at time t; γj 
is  the  specific  effect  of  the  sector  of  activity  defined  by  the  National  Classification  of 
Economic Activities; vi is the timing of entry of firms; t is an annual dummy introduced 
to capture the technological progress of the entire industry; hit is the measure of human 
capital; eit is  the logarithm of the learning measure,  eit = log(Eit).  Lastly  uijt denotes 
the error term.  

 

3.  Results 

 
In  this  section,  the  results  from  the  models  discussed  in  the  methodological 
section  are  presented.  We  will  highlight  the  effects  that  turnover  has  on    productivity 
through learning. The graphs presented in this section seek to reinforce the relationship 
between the degree of learning and the level of productivity of firms. To that end, three 
measures of TFP are presented, as described in section 3.2.4. 

3.1. Relationship between learning and productivity 

 
Graphs  1-4  are  plotted  pooling  information  from  all  firms  in  the  sample.  In 
Graphs  1  and  2,  productivity  is  estimated  by  OLS  while    learning  is  measured  using  
depreciation  based  on  turnover  rate  in  graph  1  and  separation  rate  in  graph  2.  In  both 
graphs, there is a lot of dispersion between firms, but the relationship between learning 
and  TFP  shows  a  clear  positive  trend.  Both  learning  measurements  show  very  similar 
correlation with TFP. Therefore, the remaining graphs will be shown only the learning 
measurement that uses the turnover rate as depreciation.

The positive trend is also observed in Graphs 3 and 4, in which productivity is 

measured by the Olley-Pakes and Levinsohn-Petrin methods, respectively. Therefore, as 
expected, despite the high dispersion among the different firms, a clear relationship 
between learning in a firm and productivity can be observed, regardless of the 
depreciation measurement used or the method by which TFP is estimated. 

In  Graphs  5-7,  the  relationships  between  TFP  and  learning  are  grouped  at  the 
 
three-digit  level  of  the  CNAE  (112  groups).  In  the  measurement  of  TFP  by  OLS,  the 
relationship is dispersed between the groups; however, a positive trend can be observed. 
The dispersion  decreases when using the Olley-Pakes method for calculating TFP, but 
the positive trend is maintained. The positive trend between the groups is also observed 
when using the Levinsohn-Petrin method.

Finally,  Graphs  8-10  show  the  mean  of  TFP  and  learning  by  firm  size  groups. 
We define firm size as the average number of employees that the firm has in the sample. 
The graphs show that there is a positive relationship between firm size and the learning 
measurement—the  larger  the  firm  is,  the  greater  the  capacity  for  the  accumulation  of 
knowledge.  This  advantage  of  large  firms  is  reflected  in  their  productivity.  In  the 
graphs,  we  can  observe  the  positive  relationship  between  firm  size  and  the  TFP 
measurements.  Therefore,  examining  the  size  of  firms,  we  have  a  highly  positive 
relationship between the TFP measurements and the learning measurement.

3.2. Effect that learning in the firm has on productivity 

 
The estimates presented here seek to isolate the effects of firm-specific learning 
on productivity. This was performed  controlling for industry fixed effects; and also for 

the  operating  time,  and  general  human  capital,  as  calculated  in  section  4.2.1.  Annual 
dummies are also included to control for macro shocks. 

 
The results of  equation  12, which estimates the  effects  of learning on TFP, are 
presented in Tables 2 and 3. The tables have three columns of results that show the three 
methods  for  calculating  TFP.  In  Table  2,  in  which  we  use  the  turnover  rate  as  a 
measurement  of  depreciation,  the  results  indicate  a  significant  positive  relationship 
between  learning  and  productivity.  Table  3,  which  uses  the  separation  rate  as 
depreciation,  also  shows  a  positive  and  significant  relationship  between  learning  and 
productivity.  

The results on the effects of learning are consistent and highly significant, with 
 
very  close  levels  in  the  different  analyses.  When  the  dependent  variable    (TFP)  is 
calculated by OLS (first columns of both tables), the learning effect approximately 11% 
(first row), regardless of how depreciation is considered in the learning measure. When 
the  dependent  variable  (TFP)  is    calculated  either  by  the  Olley-Pakes  or  by  the 
Levinsohn-Petrin  methods,  (second  and  third  columns)  the  learning  effect  is  greater 
than  that  calculated  by  OLS,  and  the  elasticity  is  approximately  26%.  General  human 
capital has a positive and significant effect in all analyses. However, the magnitude of 
this  effect  is  more  sensible  to  the  alternative  measures  for  productivity  and  learning 
depreciation.  

Finally, despite the negative sign and despite being significant, the “Entry year” 
variable,  which  captures  the  effect  of  the  different  times  of  entry  of  the  firms,  has 
almost zero effect.

4.  Robustness 

 
4.1. Methodological Refinements 

The  estimation  of  (12)  may  be  compromised  by  endogeneity  for  the  learning 
term.  Note  that  this  term  is  a  function  of  production  in  the  previous  period.  As  a 
consequence, it becomes a function of productivity in the previous period (as we have 
defined productivity as a component of production). If we assume that productivity has 
some temporal persistence (for example if it’s evolution is approximated by an AR (1) 
process), chances are high that our learning term will be correlated with the error of the 
equation  (1).  This  fact  would  bias  the  estimate  for  𝛾𝑒(our  coefficient  of  interest)  by 
OLS. 

𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛾0 + 𝛾𝑗 + 𝛾𝑣𝑣𝑖 + 𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾ℎℎ𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾𝑒𝑔(𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑡−1) + 𝑢𝑖𝑗𝑡 

The  introduction  of  a  fixed  effect  would  only  complicate  the  matter  further, 
since the necessary variables transformation to get rid of the fixed effect (first difference 
for  example)  would  strength  the  correlation  between  the  (transformed)  error  term  and 
the (transformed) learning term. For the transformed model this correlation would hold 
even in the absence of any temporal persistence.2 

Avoiding Endogeneity 

As we have seen before, our theoretical framework underlining the productivity 
estimation assumes that production can be decomposed into a set of terms related to the 
use of factors, and an efficiency term that correspond to the productivity. On the other 
hand, in the theoretical framework that underlies the terms of learning, it is mentioned 
that  this  is  determined  precisely  by  the  use  of  factors  (in  particular  labor).  Efficiency 
                                                           
2 This is a problem widely discussed in economics since Nickel's seminal contribution (1981). Arellano 
and co-authors suggested in the 1990s ways to circumvent this problem with the aid of instrumental 
variables. However recent contributions in the literature of weak instruments show that these forms 
may aggravate the problem rather than attenuate it.

Hence,  an alternative 
measure of learning should purge the term of efficiency (productivity) from production. 
That is, we can define the following alternative measure to the learning term: 

    𝐸𝑖𝑡 = 𝛿(𝐸𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝑞𝑖𝑡−1 − 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑡−1) 

   

 

(14) 

Equation (6) allow us to write the expression above as: 

 𝐸𝑖𝑡 = 𝛿(𝐸𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝛽0 + 𝛽𝐾𝑘𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝛽𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑡−1), 

Which makes explicit the relation with the use of factors. 

Note that the measure presented in (14) allows estimating a model analogous to 
that  expressed  in  (12).  Table  4  below  report  the  results  from  that  estimation  where 
depreciation in learning is based on turn-over rate. We see that our previous results are 
robust, in the sense that the elasticity are still positive and relatively lower when PTF is 
estimated  using  OLS.  Table  5  shows  that  the  same  conclusion  applies  once  you  use 
separation rate for depreciation.

4.2. Human capital measurement 

We have mentioned in section 2.2.3 two alternative ways to measure the human 
capital index of a firm. So far all the results were based in one of these procedures. The 
aim  of  this  subsection  is  to  show  whether  the  results  are  sensible  to  this  choice  of 
variables.  All  the  results  so  far  were  based  on  the  index  that  use  a  higher  education 
dummy combining complete secondary education with higher levels of education. The 
alternative  measure  considers  the  complete  secondary  education  level  in  a  dummy 
representing  an  intermediary    level  of  education.  Tables  6  and  7  brings  results 
analogous  to  the  ones  shown  in  tables  4  and  5,  but  with  this  alternative  way  of 
considering  secondary  education  in  the  human  capital  index.  It  is  clear  that  our  main 
conclusions are not affected by this choice of variable.

Final considerations  

The recent growth of the Brazilian economy has occurred with low productivity 
gains,  even  compared  to  other  countries  with  a  similar  level  of  development.  One 
possible explanation is high labor turnover, which has negative effects on learning. This 
excessive  movement  between  jobs  is  associated  with  low  levels  of  commitment  and 
investment  in  professional  training,  both  by  workers  and  by  firms,  with  consequences 
for labor productivity. 

 
In this paper, we studied the effect that high turnover in the job market had on 
the  productivity  of  Brazilian  manufacturing  firms  between  1996  and  2013.  Initially,  a 
description  of  the  behavior  of  the  turnover  rate  for  the  Brazilian  job  market  in  recent 
decades was presented. The turnover rate has remained high and was indicated as one of 
the obstacles to productivity growth. 

 
We  used  the  learning  by  doing  literature,  which  claims  that  intra-firm 
productivity gains can occur through efficiency gains achieved via the accumulation of 
learning  that  results  from  the  act  of  producing.  We  estimated  a  learning  measurement 
for capturing the loss of human capital, resulting from turnover, and the effect that this 
has on TFP.  

TFP  was  calculated  using  three  different  methods:  OLS,  the  Olley-Pakes 
 
method,  and  the  Levinsohn-Petrin  method.  By  correlating  our  learning  measurement 
with the TFP estimates, we found a positive relationship using different specifications. 

 
In  the  empirical  analysis,  we  sought  to  isolate  the  specific  human  capital  of 
workers in the learning variable, using an estimate of general human capital as a control. 
Thus, as a result,  we have a more precise effect  from the learning  accumulated during
