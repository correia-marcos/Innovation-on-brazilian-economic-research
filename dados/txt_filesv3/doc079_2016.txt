Abstract 
This aim of this article is to investigate the effects of income inequality on the economic growth 
of Brazilian states in the period from 1994 to 2011. The transmission mechanism of the effects 
of income inequality on economic growth is derived from the model proposed by Halter et al. 
(2014). The empirical formulation adopted to achieve this goal is divided into two stages. The 
first stage is limited to short-term analysis, and panel data models with fixed effects, random 
effects, and instrumental variables are used. In the second stage, the discussion turns to the use 
of the error correction model for a cointegrated panel. The results suggest a significant negative 
correlation  between  income  inequality  and  the  economic  growth  of  Brazilian  states  in  both 
short-term and long-term analyses.

1 Introduction 
 

Income inequality is a recurring theme in the Brazilian economy, principally with regard 
to studies of economic growth. This discussion gained ground in the economics literature of the 
1990s  with  a  series  of  studies  investigating  the  role  of  income  inequality  in  the  process  of 
economic  growth.  The  following  question  always  arises  in  this  type  of  analysis:  How  does 
income inequality affect economic growth? 

Two different approaches to this topic have been taken. The first, represented by Bertola 
(1991), Perotti (1992), Persson and Tabellini (1994), and Alesina and Perotti (1996), suggests 
the existence of mechanisms by which greater inequality harms economic growth; these include 
an  endogenous  fiscal  policy,  social  and  political  instability,  imperfect  credit  markets,  and 
endogenous fertility rates. 

Another branch of the economics literature emphasizes the beneficial effect of greater 
initial  inequality  in  spurring  economic  growth  through  three  channels:  Kaldor’s  hypothesis, 
indivisible  investment  costs,  and  trade-offs  between  efficiency  and  equity.  Stigliz  (1969), 
Lazear and Rosen (1979), Li and Zou (1998), and Forbes (2000) are among the authors who 
emphasize this type of correlation. 

Starting  from  this  discussion,  the  present  study  investigates  the  effects  of  income 
inequality on the economic growth of different Brazilian states from 1994 to 2011. This study’s 
main contribution is empirical because it presents stylized facts that aid in understanding the 
effects of income concentration on economic performance in different regions of Brazil. 

Regional  disparities  in  Brazil  have  always  been  a  cause  for  concern and  a  subject  of 
national debate, especially after the creation of the Superintendency for the Development of the 
Northeast (Superintendência do Desenvolvimento do Nordeste - SUDENE) in 1950. The notion 
of regional disparities is even more obvious when regional economic indicators are presented, 
such as those emphasized by Rands (2011). The numbers show that although the Northeast is 
home to 28% of the Brazilian population, it has a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) that 
is only 46.8% of the national per capita GDP, and only 35.3% of the per capita GDP found in 
the Southeast, which is the highest in the nation.1 Other regions, such as the North and Center-
West (excluding the federal district of Brasília) are also relatively poor, though their per capita 
GDPs are still higher than the Northeast. 

Evidently, this discussion is not new for the Brazilian economy, and a number of studies 
have attempted to explore and test explanatory hypotheses for the differences in regional growth 
rates within Brazil, including Lledó (1996), Bagolin et al. (2004), Jacinto and Tejada (2004), 
Salvato et al. (2008), Kakwani et al. (2010), and Galeano (2014). 

Most of these studies attempt to test Kuznets’ hypothesis  that there is  an inverted U-
shaped correlation between inequality and growth; examples are Lledó (1996), Bagolin et al. 
(2004), Jacinto and Tejada (2004), and Salvato et al. (2008). The first of these studies was not 
able to find evidence to confirm this hypothesis for Brazilian states in the 1970s or 1980s. By 
contrast, the other studies were able to validate the hypothesis by analyzing municipalities in 
the state of  Rio Grande do Sul, the Northeast  region, and the state of  Minas Gerais after the 
1980s. 

Taking a different perspective, Kakwani et al. (2010) analyze the relationship between 
the growth of poverty in Brazil based on the performance of different sources of income, such 
as the labor market – hypothesizing that an improvement in employment rates contributes to 
economic  growth  –  and  social  programs  enacted  during  the  1990s,  finding  that  these  social 
policies were successful in reducing poverty.

-IBGE) for 2008.

Along  the  same  line  of  investigation,  Galeano  (2014)  examines  the  improvement  in 
Brazil’s  macroeconomic  environment  since  the  mid-1990s  and  the  theory  of  endogenous 
growth,  using  the  Theil  index  and  convergence  analysis  to  demonstrate  some  economic 
deconcentration from 1985 to 2008. However, her study suggests few improvements in terms 
of regional economic inequality, indicating a process of convergence that is very slow and that 
does  not  take  the  desired  form  of  strong,  widespread  growth  but  rather  weak  growth  in  the 
regions of Brazil. 

The present study differs from the others in that it adapts the discussion proposed by 
Halter et al. (2014) to the analysis of Brazilian states. Halter et al. (2014) derive the transmission 
channel  between  income  inequality  and  economic  growth,  showing  a  non-monotonic 
adjustment trajectory2 of production that leads to a linear theoretical model of income inequality 
and economic growth that is similar to those used in this type of approach. 

The findings of this study suggest that inequalities in income and educational level are 
the principal determinants of different growth rates among Brazilian states. More specifically, 
it is found that additional years of schooling positively influence growth. By contrast, income 
inequality negatively affects this indicator. 

The remainder of this article is divided into five sections. The next section shows the 
recent  behavior  of  income  inequality  in  Brazil.  It  is  followed  by  the  proposed  theoretical 
discussion of Halter et al. (2014) for expressing the relationship between economic growth and 
income inequality. Section 4 of the article presents the panel data method with cointegration, in 
addition to the database used and its limitations. Section 5 shows and discusses the principal 
results of the empirical strategy. Finally, the article concludes with final considerations. 

 

2 Recent behavior of income inequality in Brazil 
 

Brazil  is  composed  of  regions  that  are  diverse  in  size  and  shape  as  well  as  in  their 
development  and  economic  growth.  These  peculiarities  lead  back  to  the  most  important 
questions  about  economic  growth,  namely:  Why  does  one  region  grow  more  than  others?  Is 
there income convergence among regions? What are the determinants of regional disparities? 
This  section  presents  stylized  facts  from  the  literature  on  economic  growth  that  can  answer 
some of the questions posed above.   

Table 1 shows growth and development statistics for the regions of Brazil in 2010. The 
first column contains per capita GDP data for 2010, showing that the Southeast held the largest 
share of the national GDP, making it the wealthiest region of Brazil in 2010, with a per capita 
GDP of BRL$25.99. 

The  Center-West  region  showed  the  second  highest  per  capita  GDP,  with  a  value  of 
BRL$24.95,  followed  by  the  South,  with  BRL$22.72.  By  contrast,  the  North  and  Northeast 
regions fell far behind, with per capita GDPs of BRL$12.70 and BRL$9.56, respectively. 

The  second  column  of  Table  1  shows  the  GDP  per  worker  in  2010.  The  difference 
between  the  first  two  columns  is  the  denominator:  the  first  divides  the  GDP  by  the  total 
population, and the second divides it by the number of workers. The employment rate, shown 
in the third column on Table 1, is the ratio of the work force to the total population in each 
region. 
 
 
 

                                                             
2 Non-monotonic adjustment allows for certain minimum levels of investment to be required for access to 
productive activity. Thus, different opportunities for production are available at different points along the income 
distribution.

A comparison of the per capita GDPs for the North and Northeast regions in 2010, for 
example, reveals that although they were similar in that year, the GDP/worker ratios were much 
different. This result is explained by the fact that workers comprise a much larger percentage 
of the total population in the Northeast than in the North. Finally, the last two columns in Table 
1 show economic growth in Brazil’s macro-regions. The fourth column reports the mean annual 
rate of GDP growth between 1985 and 2010, drawn from the variation in the natural logarithm 
of the GDP. It can be noted that the mean annual GDP growth rate of the Southeast was only 
2.43% between 1985 and 2010 whereas the Center-West, Northeast, North, and South grew at 
a  faster  rate  than  the  Southeast,  with  the  North  registering  the  fastest  rate  of  growth,  a 
remarkable 5.18%. 

With regard to the time it would take each region to double its GDP, shown by column 
5 in Table 1, the Southeast’s GDP would double in 29 years, whereas the North’s GDP would 
double in approximately 14 years. In other words, if these growth rates were to persist for two 
generations, a citizen of the North region would be approximately 20 times richer than his or 
her  grandparents.  It  is  important  to  note,  however,  that  growth  rates  can  lead  to  significant 
differences in individual wealth. 

It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  all  of  the  data  presented  in  Table  1  can  be  used  as 
measures for comparing the development levels of states or regions; however, this article uses 
the  per capita  GDP  as  a  measure  of  well-being.  This  argument  is  the  same  as that  made  by 
Jones (2000), namely, that the per capita GDP represents the sum of the available product, per 
person, that can be consumed, invested, or otherwise employed and is the most general measure 
of well-being. By contrast, the GDP per worker is more closely related to labor productivity. 

Figure 1 shows the relationship between GDP growth rates in 1985-2010 and the initial 
per capita GDP in 1985 as  well as the relationship between GDP  growth rates  for the same 
period  and  GDP  per  worker  in  1985.  This  figure  was  created  to  determine  whether  income 
appears to be converging among Brazilian states. 

The hypothesis of convergence is intended to verify whether the difference in per capita 
income  among  the  states  diminished  over  time.  Figure  1  suggests  that  the  hypothesis  of 
convergence among Brazilian states is rejected, both for  per capita GDP and for per worker 
GDP. In short, the existing gap between per capita GDPs in poor and rich regions of Brazil is 
not narrowing.3 

 

                                                             
3 The hypothesis of the convergence of income among Brazilian states is discussed again and more formally in 
section 5.

This result is corroborated by Figure 2, which  shows the behavior of per capita GDP 
for the regions of Brazil between 1985 and 2011. It can be observed that the richest and poorest 
regions at the beginning of this period maintained their relative positions over the period, with 
the Southeast and Northeast appearing as the richest and poorest regions, respectively, in 1985 
and in 2011. Once again, this finding contradicts the hypothesis of convergence in growth rates 
over this period.

Figure 3 shows the recent evolution of the gap or ratio between the richest 10% and the 
poorest 40% in different regions of Brazil from 1985 to 2010. The graph of this indicator shows 
that the distance between the richest and the poorest widened in all regions from 1985 to 1994, 
after which the trend was reversed and there has been a sharp and sustained narrowing of the 
gap. 

During this period, the greatest reduction in the gap between the richest and the poorest 
was in the South, where the ratio of income between the richest 10% and the poorest 40% of 
the region’s population declined from 18.64 in 1995 to 9.99 in 2014; this decline represents a

poor gap, at 32.88%.

Table 2 also shows the behavior of income inequality on a national scale and a regional 
scale between 1990 and 2014, as measured by the Gini index. It is important to note that the 
Gini index measures the degree of income inequality among individuals, according to per capita 
household income. This index ranges from 0 to 1, with a coefficient close to 1 indicating a very 
unequal income distribution and a coefficient closer to 0 indicating less income concentration.

The reduction in income inequality in Brazil shown in Figure 3 is corroborated by the 
analysis of the Gini index. The scenario is the same as that presented above, with a perceptible 
reduction in the inequality of income distribution in Brazil from 1990 to 2014 of 6.94%, which 
represents a reduction of 0.04 points on the Gini index. Nevertheless, with an index over 0.50 
in 2014, Brazil still demonstrates a high concentration of income compared to other developing 
countries  such  as  Argentina  and  Uruguay,  where  the  Gini  indices  for  2013  were  0.423  and 
0.419, respectively. 

Following the trend of the Brazilian economy, all of the macro-regions also showed a 
reduction in income inequality, though these effects were greater in the Southern region of the 
country. The South reduced income inequality among its population by 21% between 1990 and 
2014, making it the region with the lowest concentration of income in 2014. 

It is worth noting that all regions experienced a continuous downward trend in income 
inequality, although this trend was less pronounced in some regions than in others. Thus, after 
the  South,  the  Northeast,  Center-West,  North,  and  Southeast  experienced  reductions  in 
inequality of 17.62%, 16.39%, 13.47%, and 13.19%, respectively.

Nevertheless,  an  analysis  of  inequality  at  the  end  of  this  period,  in  2014,  shows  that 
although the Southeast had the smallest decline in its income distribution gap, the Northeast, 
Center-West, and North are still the regions with the highest indices of income inequality in 
Brazil, with Gini indices of 0.535, 0.527, and 0.518, respectively. 
 
3 Theoretical model 
 

This section presents the discussion proposed by Halter et al. (2014) in which they seek 
to  derive  the  transmission  channel  between  income  inequality  and  economic  growth.  The 
theoretical  framework  presented  below  permits  a  non-monotonic  adjustment  trajectory  of 
production4 and leads to a linear theoretical model of income inequality and economic growth 
that is similar to those used in this type of approach. 

The model is based on an economy populated by families characterized by an infinite 
life horizon and aversion to risk, with this latter component represented by the discount factor 
β  <  1.  All  individuals  derive  utility  from  consuming  a  single  produced  good.  Thus,  their 
preferences are represented by the following intertemporal utility function:  

                              

  𝒰𝑡 = 𝔼𝑡 {∑

∞
𝑠=0

 βs ct+s

},                                                   (1) 

 
where 𝑐𝑡 denotes consumption in the period t and 𝔼𝑡 is the conditional expectation operator on 
the  information  available  at  t.  Individuals  differ  in  their  allocation  of  productive  assets 
(represented, for example, by capital stock). 

This  economy  is  composed  of  rich  and  poor  individuals.  Poor  individuals  are 
represented  by  the  fraction  𝜎  >  ½  of  the  population  (poor  individuals  are  represented  by  P) 
because the majority of the population consists of wage earners and their allocation of assets 
takes the form 𝜔𝑝 (𝐷𝑡 ) < 1, in which 1 is the mean income in the economy. 
 

The state variable5 of 𝐷𝑡  ∈   {𝐿, 𝐻} represents the degree of inequality of assets in the 
economy,  where  L  signifies  a  low  degree  and  H  a  high  degree  of  inequality.  From  this 
segmentation arises a scenario in which the allocation of poor individuals with  a low level of 
inequality is larger than the allocation of poor individuals with a high level of inequality, which 
can be described by 𝜔𝑝(𝐿) >   𝜔𝑝 (𝐻). 

All  individuals  have  access  to  a  simple  technology  that  uses  the  productive  physical 
capital asset as an input factor. In formal terms, the technology is characterized by the following 
production function:  

 

𝑞 (𝜔, 𝐺𝑡) =   {

𝑎𝑙 𝜔𝑋(𝐺𝑡):   𝜔 <   𝜔𝑐 
𝑎ℎ𝜔𝑋(𝐺𝑡) ∶  𝜔  ≥   𝜔𝑐 

, 𝑎𝑙  <   𝑎ℎ                                      (2) 

 
where q is the product; X(Gt) represents the level of public good provided by the government; 
and ah and al represent high and low levels of productivity, respectively.  

The supply of the public good is represented by the state variable of 𝐺𝑡 ∈   {0,1}.  For 
low levels of inequality, if the government invests in the public good, then 𝐺𝑡 = 1; otherwise, 
𝐺𝑡 = 0. As a result, we have 𝑋(1) −  𝑋(0) ≡   ∆𝑋  > 0. 
                                                             
4 The idea posits minimum levels of investment required to gain access to productive activities; thus, there are 
different production opportunities available along the income distribution. 
5 This is the smallest group of variables that determines the state of a dynamic system. If at least “n” variables 
(𝑋1(𝑡), 𝑋2(𝑡), … , 𝑋𝑛(𝑡)) are necessary to completely describe the behavior of a dynamic system, then these “n” 
variables are a group of state variables. They describe the future response of a system, given the current state, the 
input stimuli, and the equations that describe the dynamic. 

8 

 

The aggregate production of the private sector is represented as follows:  
 

𝕐 ( 𝐷𝑡 , 𝐺𝑡 ) = ( 𝑎ℎ −  𝜎 ( 𝑎ℎ −   𝑎𝑙 ) 𝜔𝑃 ( 𝐷𝑡 ) ) 𝑋(𝐺𝑡)                               (3) 

  

 
Note that the aggregate production  is lower than its first best level, which is equal to 
𝑎ℎ 𝑋 ( 𝐺𝑡 ). This occurs because a positive fraction of the total stock of productive assets is used 
by companies with low average productivity. 

To  linearize  the  model,  we  impose  𝜔𝑃 (𝐷𝑡) =  1 −   𝐷𝑡,  with  𝐷𝑡   ∈   {𝐿, 𝐻}  being  the 
difference between the mean allocation and a poor individual’s allocation. Next, the logarithms 
of  both  sides  of  equation  (3)  should  be  taken.  Then,  rearranging  the  terms,  we  obtain  the 
following: 

 

𝜎 ( 𝑎ℎ− 𝑎𝑙 )𝜔𝑃 (𝐷𝑡)

𝑎ℎ

) +   ln (

  𝓎𝑡   ≡   ln 𝕐𝑡 =   ln (1 −  
 
It is important to emphasize that 𝐺𝑡 is a variable of choice that takes the value of 1 if 
𝐷𝑡−1 = 𝐿 and  0  if  𝐷𝑡−1 = 𝐻.  Thus,  𝑋(𝐺𝑡)  can  be  written  as   
  .  Using  the 
expression for 𝑋(𝐺𝑡) and given that 𝜔𝑃 (𝐷𝑡) =   (1 −   𝐷𝑡) in equation (4), it is possible to obtain 
the following: 

) +   ln 𝑎ℎ +   ln 𝑋(0)           (4)

The theoretical discussion presented includes two channels by which  asset inequality 
affects economic performance. However, empirical models of  inequality and growth such as 
those  by  Alesina  and  Rodrik  (1991)  and  Alesina  and  Perotti  (1996),  including  the  model 
estimated  in  section  5,  generally  rely  on  measures  of  income  inequality,  mainly  due  to  the 
availability of data. In our case, the two concepts are closely related. Consider the  following 
measure of income inequality: 
 

𝓎 =  

𝐷𝑡

 𝕐 ( 𝐷𝑡 ,𝐺𝑡 )− 𝑎𝑙 𝜔𝑃 ( 𝐷𝑡 ) 𝑋(𝐺𝑡)

𝕐 ( 𝐷𝑡 ,𝐺𝑡 )

                                                (7) 

 
which gives the relative difference between mean income and the poor individual’s income and 
is therefore equivalent to the measure of asset inequality  𝐷𝑡. Using the functional form of  𝕐 
given in equation (3) and given that 𝜔𝑃 (𝐷𝑡) =  1 −   𝐷𝑡, this measure of income inequality can 
be approximated by the following linear function such that 𝐷𝑡:  
                                                             
6 If the condition (C2) is violated, the level of the public good will never change. As a result, 𝜃2will be equal to 0 
(while 𝜃1 remains unchanged).

The structure of equation (8) reflects the fact that income inequality is propelled by two different 
factors: rich individuals become richer, that is, 𝐷𝑡 > 0, and rich individuals also obtain a better 
return  on  their  wealth,  which  is  shown  by  the  constant  on  the  right-hand  side  of  (8).  The

are close to 0.  

Expression (8) allows us to relate the logarithm of the current level of production, 𝓎𝑡, 
to  the  current  and  past  levels  of  income  inequality.  Isolating  𝐷𝑡  from  equation  (8)  and 
substituting it into equation (6), we obtain the following: 

 

 

𝓎𝑡   ≅   𝛿1𝐷𝑡

𝓎 +  𝛿2𝐷𝑡−1

𝓎 +  𝑣                                                    (9)

  and  the  Gini  coefficient  for  income 

Equation  (8)  expresses  the  level  of  the  production  logarithm  𝓎𝑡  as  a  function  of 
inequality. To find the standard specification used in the empirical literature, we must add a 
multiplicative  parameter  𝐴𝑡  into  the  production  function  that  does  not  depend  on  the  use  of 
productive  assets,  represented  by  𝐴𝑡 =   (𝕐𝑡−1)𝜑,  with  𝜑  ∈   [0,1).  Thus,  the  relationship 
between product growth and inequality is given as follows: 
 

 𝓎𝑡 −   𝓎𝑡−1   ≅  𝛾𝓎𝑡−1 +   𝛿1𝐷𝑡

𝓎 +   𝛿2𝐷𝑡−1

𝓎 +  𝜂                                (10)  

 
where   𝛾  ≡   𝜑 − 1 < 0.  The  equation  above  is  the  basis  for  the  empirical  model  that  is 
estimated in the following section, and it is similar to the empirical models commonly used in 
the  literature  on  inequality  and  growth.  Thus,  the  implication  is  that  both  current  and  past 
inequality can affect growth. 
 
4 Methodological procedures 
 
4.1 Empirical strategy 
 

The short- and long-term effects of inequality on growth are estimated by transforming 

equation (10) into a panel data model, which can be represented as follows:  

 

𝑦𝑖𝑡 −   𝑦𝑖𝑡−1 =  𝛾𝑦𝑖𝑡−1 +   𝑑𝑖𝑡   +   𝑑𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝛿′𝑥𝑖𝑡−1 +   𝜁𝑡 +   (𝜂𝑖 +   𝜈𝑖𝑡)               (11) 
 

where 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁 denotes one of the 27 states Brazilian that comprise the data sample and 𝑡 =
1, … , 𝑇 is time.  

On  the  left-hand  side,  𝑦𝑖𝑡  represents  the  log  of  real  per  capita  GDP  and  shows  an 
approximate rate of growth. On the right-hand side, in addition to the lagged per capita GDP 
are the terms that represent the current and lagged value of income inequality, represented by 
𝑑𝑖𝑡  and  𝑑𝑖𝑡−1,  respectively.  Additionally,  there  is  the  vector  𝑥𝑖𝑡−1,  which  is  composed  of 
variables that characterize each state, such as education level, gross fixed capital formation, and 
market distortions, as proposed by Halter et al. (2014); a period-specific effect 𝜁𝑡 used to capture 

 

10 

productivity changes common to all the countries; a country-specific effect 𝜂𝑖 that captures non-
observed and time-invariant characteristics of a country; and an idiosyncratic error term 𝜈𝑖𝑡. 

It is important to emphasize that before proceeding with the estimation of equation (11), 

the unit root tests proposed by Hadri (2000) and Levin et al. (2002) are applied. 

For the case where the series present the same order of integration, the next step is to 
verify the possibility of cointegration between economic growth and the other variables. If the 
series are cointegrated, then the discussion turns to the analysis proposed by Frank et al. (2005). 
This  analysis  seeks  to  present  the  mean  group  (MG)  estimator  and  the  pooled  mean  group 
(PMG) proposed by Pesaran et al. (1999), which combines both the poolings and the means of 
the  data  and  the  dynamic  fixed  effect  (DFE)  estimator.  Now,  the  strategy  is  to  study  the 
magnitude of the long-term relationship between the inequality-growth binomial, differentiating 
this study from the strategy adopted by Halter et al. (2014). 
 
4.2 Description and source of the data 
 

 

This section presents the variables used in the empirical model, in addition to the sources 
from which they were drawn and the expected signs, as shown in Table (3). The dataset used in 
this analysis is composed of annual figures for real per capita GDP, the Gini index, investment 
or gross fixed capital formation, and political instability over the period from 1994 to 2011.

It is important to highlight some observations about the data: 1) The choice of variables 
is based on the work of Halter et al. (2014); 2) the choice of this time period was made due to 
the availability of data; 3) the capital spending of states was used as a proxy for investment; 4) 
homicide rates were used as a proxy for political stability; 5) the education level was calculated 
as the mean number of years of schooling among people 25 years of age and older. 

In addition, the capital spending series and the number of homicides were substituted by 
industrial  energy  consumption  (in  kWh)  and  corruption  indices,  as  proposed  by  Boll  (2010), 
with the intention of verifying the robustness of the results. Series of regional dummies and the 
degree of trade openness were also used  as control variables; the inclusion of these terms  is 
discussed in more detail in section 5. 

Finally, all of the series were treated as natural logarithms and calculated as means of 
the previous three years. In this regard, this study differs from Halter et al. (2014), who treated 
these variables as  means of the previous five  years. The use of three-year means rather than 
five-year means is related to data availability, and the purpose of using means for the variables 
is to capture the past effects of the lagged explanatory variables on economic growth.

5 Discussion and analysis of the results 
 

The discussion of the relationship between economic growth and its determinants starts 
with  the  analysis  of  the  mean  behavior  of  the  studied  series  during  the  period  from  1994  to 
2011. Table 4 shows the mean value of the series of per capita GDP, investment, the Gini index, 
political instability, and education level for each of the Brazilian states and the Federal District. 
As Table 4 shows, the Brazilian states are a heterogeneous group. The Federal District, 
for  example,  has  a  per  capita  GDP  of  R$  50.41  and  mean  educational  level  of  8.6  years  of 
schooling. By contrast, Piauí has a per capita GDP of R$ 5.49 (only 11% of that of the Federal 
District) and a mean educational level of 4.2 years of schooling. These regional differences are 
also evident in the other variables.

In addition, this initial analysis does not clarify the influence of income inequality on 
economic growth. It can be observed that the highest mean concentration of income and the 
lowest mean per capita GDPs are found in the states of Piauí, Maranhão, Alagoas, and Paraíba. 

 

12 

However,  the  Federal  District  shows  the  highest  mean  Gini  index  and  the  highest  mean  per 
capita  GDP.  Thus,  this  initial  analysis  does  not  make  explicit  the  possible  sign  or  effect  of 
inequality on growth. This effect is only captured in the empirical analysis. 

Thus, this initial analysis does not make explicit whether inequality has a positive or 
negative effect on growth, nor does it clarify the size of the effect, which is only captured in the 
empirical analysis. Before proceeding, the estimates from the panel data models are subjected 
to the unit root tests proposed by Hadri (2000) and Levin et al. (2002). The idea is to compare 
the results obtained from tests that have different null hypotheses. In the case at hand,  the test 
proposed by Hadri (2000) takes the absence of a unit root as the null hypothesis, whereas  the 
test of Levin et al. (2002) takes the presence of a unit root as the null hypothesis. The results of 
these tests reject the hypothesis of a unit root for the series, concluding that they are integrated 
on the same order I(0), as shown in Table 5.

Table 6 shows four distinct methods of estimating the relationship between economic 
growth  and  the  determinants  proposed  in  this  article  (educational  level,  income  inequality, 
investment, and political instability). The estimates obtained from the panel models with fixed 
and random effects are shown in the second and third columns, respectively. The Hausman test 
indicates that the random effects model is preferable to the fixed effects model (at a 5% level 
of significance). 

The  following  columns  show  the  estimates  obtained  by  estimating  with  instrumental 
variables, with Model B incorporating the state’s trade openness and Model C including both 
the state’s trade openness and regional dummies. 

The results of Table 6 show that political instability is the only non-significant variable. 
The estimates of models B and C reinforce the consistency of the random effects model. It is 
notable that the lagged per capita GDP negatively affects the mean growth rate. In contrast to 
the  observations  made  in  section  2,  this  result  suggests  a  process  of  absolute  income 
convergence among  the states. The coefficients that measure the effect of inequality suggest 
that, as expected, current inequality (𝑑𝑡) has a negative effect on growth but the coefficient of 
past inequality (𝑑𝑡−1) has a positive effect on growth.

With regard to the coefficient of past inequality, two observations may be made. First, 
the  positive  effect  on  growth  may  be  understood  as  a  consequence  of  income  inequality’s 
creation of an incentive for effort. According to Mirrless (1971), the possibility of obtaining a 
relatively higher income as a reward for greater effort acts as an incentive for individuals with 
different skill levels to achieve greater productivity. The second observation is related to the 
fact that Halter et al. (2014) address the effect of past inequality to show the long-term effects 
of inequality on economic growth, using the methodology proposed by Frank et al. (2005) and 
Herzer and Vollmer (2012) to capture this effect. 

The  coefficients  of  the  investment  and  education  level  variables  yield  the  expected 
results. However, the effect of public investment on growth is small, which may be due to the 
states’ limited capacity for investment. During the period studied, the states’ mean investment 
is  only  3%  of  the  state  GDP.7  The  magnitude  of  the  education  level  coefficient  reflects  the 
importance of human capital. The results ratify the idea that educating the workforce has a direct 
relationship with gains in productivity and, consequently, with economic growth. 

It should be noted that in addition to the exercises displayed in Table 6, corruption and 
energy consumption are also employed as proxy variables to represent political instability and 
investment, respectively, with the same results achieved.

5.1 Cointegrated panel and its long-term relationship 
 

In addition to the discussion presented above, it is important to test the hypothesis of 
cointegration between the terms studied, which is the most common method of expressing the 
long-term relationship between the variables proposed in the study. This stage of the research 
limits  itself  to  analyzing  the  long-term  effects  of  income  inequality  and  education  level  on 
growth because these variables have the greatest explanatory influence on growth in Brazilian 
states.  First, cointegration tests for panel data based on Pedroni (2004) are applied to determine 
whether  there  is  a  long-term  relationship  between  the  variables  described  in  the  preceding 
paragraph.

The  test  results  suggest  a  relationship  of  cointegration  between  economic  growth, 
income  inequality,  and  education  level,  given  that  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  cointegration  is 
rejected by all of the tests. Thus, the cointegration tests indicate long-term equilibrium between 
these  terms.  With  this  done,  the  next  stage  is  limited  to  capturing  the  long-term  effect  of 
inequality and educational level on economic growth. 

Assume  an  autoregressive  distributed  lag  (ARDL)  dynamic  panel  (𝑝, 𝑞1, … , 𝑞𝑘)  that

where the number of groups 𝑖 = 1, 2, ..., N; the number of periods is 𝑡 = 1, 2, ..., T; 𝑋𝑖𝑡 is a

The  terms  𝜃1𝑖  and  𝜃2𝑖  capture  the  long-term  effects  and  represent  the  effects  of 
educational level and income inequality, respectively. The parameter 𝜙𝑖 represents the error-
corrected speed of adjustment. If the variables show a return to long-term equilibrium, then this 
parameter  will  be  significantly  negative  because  as  the  error  correction  term  measures 
deviations from long-term equilibrium between the variables. If the term (1 −   𝜆𝑖) is positive, 
then a negative correction should occur in the following period, ensuring that the system returns 
to equilibrium. If 𝜙𝑖  ≥ 0, then there would be no evidence for a long-term relationship.  

Table 8 shows the three estimates that attempt to measure these effects, namely: a) MG 
estimates that impose no restrictions; b) PMG estimates that impose common long-term effects; 
and c) DFE estimates that require that all slope coefficients and all error variances be the same.8

Table 8 shows that the effects of income inequality and education level do not change 
in  the  long-term  analysis,  which  reinforces  the idea  that an  increase  in  inequality  negatively 
affects growth and, conversely, higher education levels positively affect growth. This result is 
robust, considering that all of the cointegrating coefficients tied to long-term effects are shown 
to be significant. 

With  regard  to  the  parameter  that  represents  the  speed  of  adjustment  of  the  error 
correction, it can be  observed that the estimates obtained from the MG and PMG  estimators 
(𝜙𝑀𝐺 = -0.62 and 𝜙𝑃𝑀𝐺 = -0.54) indicate short-term dynamics that are different, significant, 
and smaller than those obtained by pooling estimates. These estimators suggest, for example, 
that the speed of convergence to the equilibrium is approximately 62% per  year for the MG 
estimator, 54% for the PMG estimator, and 169% for the DFE estimator. 
 
 
6 Conclusion 
 

The discussion about the transmission channel for the effects of income inequality on 
economic growth is not new, and over the years, it has drawn the attention of researchers who 
attempt  to  explain  the  importance  of  this  relationship.  This  study,  for  example,  uses  the 
theoretical model proposed by  Halter et al. (2014), in which a theoretical model with a non-

                                                             
8 Baltagi (2008) notes that the DFE standard-errors are corrected by the heteroscedasticity of the error variances 
among countries; the non-corrected values are substantially smaller. The robust heteroscedasticity of the 
standard errors are calculated by means of a general covariance matrix of the disturbances 𝜀𝑖𝑡 among the 
individuals i.

monotonic adjustment trajectory leads to a linear model that represents the inequality-growth 
relationship. 

The empirical results suggest that, among all of the factors studied, only the effects of 
education level and income inequality  are analyzed in both the short term and the long term. 
The main conclusion drawn from these analyses is that regardless of which method is adopted 
(panel  model  with  fixed  effects,  random  effects,  instrumental  variables  and  cointegration 
analysis),  education  level  and  income  inequality  affect  economic  growth  positively  and 
negatively, respectively, and that these factors are able to explain some of the differences in 
growth rates among different regions of Brazil. 

A  future  discussion  will  address  the  effects  of  statistical  predictability  on  economic 
growth  and  income  inequality  using  the  Granger  test  of  causality.  The  importance  of  this 
analysis is that causality suggests that changes in economic growth are able to predict changes 
in  inequality,  and  vice  versa,  an  element  that  has  been  little  explored  in  the  literature.  In 
addition,  the  Brazilian  states  will  be  divided  into  two  groups  (those  with  higher  and  lower 
indices of inequality) for the purpose of verifying whether the  effect of inequality on growth 
remains valid or whether other factors become more relevant in explaining the economic growth 
of these states.
