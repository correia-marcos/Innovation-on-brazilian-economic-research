The proﬁtability of self-ﬁnancing pairs portfolio trading strategy is compared in the American, Brazilian
and main European stock markets with two diﬀerent pairs selection methodologies: For all three databases
we use daily data to compare the performance of pairs trading based on the selection of pairs through
minimizing the sum of squared deviation (distance method) and the selection based on cointegration
tests (cointegration method) for identifying stocks suited for pairs trading strategies. In the european
markets, the portfolios formed through the cointegration tests exhibits average annual excess return of
up to 13, 73%, with close to zero correlation with the market. We also ﬁnd that the pairs formed through
cointegration tests perform better out of sample than the pairs formed through the minimization of
the sum of squared deviations, with higher net return and Sharpe Ratio. For Brazil, between 1996 and
2012 we use daily data to compare the perfomance of both pairs trading methodologies. The portfolios
based on the cointegration method exhibits average annual excess return of up to 23%, with close to
zero correlation with the market. They also perform better out of sample with higher net return, higher
sharpe ratio and slightly lower volatility. For the United States, on the other hand, the portfolios formed
through the distance method have a superior performance, with excess returns of up to 10, 47% superior
than the 5, 57% return obtained by the cointegration method.

Introduction

The computational advances of the past decades have stimulated the development of trading
via computer programs and the rise of algorithmic trading. These systems are designed to search
for patterns in ﬁnancial markets, detect deviation of market prices from these patterns, and proﬁt
from detected anomalies. Algorithmic trading is now responsible for more than 70 percent of the
trading volume in the the US markets (Hendershott et al. 2011). On the other hand, events like the
Flash Crash of May 6 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 600 points in less than
5 minutes, revealed the lack of knowledge about the consequences and robustness of algorithms
used in practice (Nuti et al. 2011).

Advances in data storage and access have also opened interesting research possibilities. The
availability of “big” data sets allows a more robust detection of statistical arbitrage opportunities
within and across markets, allowing a more comprehensive evaluation of the eﬀectiveness of trading
algorithms. This paper proposes the use of large datasets from stock markets in Europe and Brazil
to test two popular pairs trading algorithms out-of-sample, namely: the sum of squared deviations
approach of Gatev et al. (2006), and the cointegration approach suggested by Alexander and
Dimitriu (2002). The markets selected allow the analysis of both strategies under diﬀerent market
conditions in an attempt to uncover diﬀerences between trading algorithms.

Pairs trading is an algorithmic trading strategy designed to exploit short-term deviations from an
existing long-run equilibrium between two stocks. However, diﬀerent methods have been proposed
in the literature to identify pairs to be traded (see, for example, Gatev et al. 2006, Elliott et al.
2005, Vidyamurthy 2004, Alexander and Dimitriu 2005, Caldeira and Moura 2013). The motivation
for trading pairs has its roots in works that preach the existence of long term relation between
stocks. If there exists indeed a long term equilibrium, deviation from this relation are expected to
revert. Since future observations of a mean-reverting time series can potentially be forecasted using
historical data, this literature challenges the notion that stock prices cannot be predicted (see, for
example Lo and MacKinlay 1988, 1997, Guidolin et al. 2009). Active asset allocation strategies
based on mean-reverting portfolios, which generally fall under the umbrella of statistical arbitrage,
have been used by investment banks and hedge funds for several years (Gatev et al. 2006). The
word statistical in context of an investment approach is an indication of the speculative character
of investment strategy. It is based on the assumption that the patterns observed in the past are
going to be repeated in the future. This is in opposition to the fundamental investment strategy
that both explores and predicts the behaviour of economic forces that inﬂuence the share prices.
Pairs trading is possibly the simplest statistical arbitrage strategy, since it consists of a portfolio
of only two assets. In this approach, we are not interested about trends for particular assets but
with a common trend among a pair of stocks, which deﬁnes a long-run equilibrium between them.
The idea behind pairs trading is that when prices of two shares move together there could be
short term deviations to be arbitraged. Thus, this trading strategy consists in detecting pairs of
stocks that historically move together, waiting for the spread between them to widen, longing
the underpriced stock and shorting the overpriced one to proﬁt when prices revert back to their
long-run equilibrium.

Thus, pairs trading is a purely statistical approach designed to exploit equity market ineﬃciencies
deﬁned as the deviation from a long-term equilibrium across stock prices observed in the past.
As argued by Do and Faﬀ (2010), pairs trading falls under the big umbrella of the long-short
investing approach. According to Avellaneda and Lee (2010) the term statistical arbitrage includes
investment strategies that have certain characteristics in common: (i) trading signals follow a
systematic rule, in opposition to fundamentals based strategies; (ii) strategies seek to be market-
neutral, in the sense that they are not exposed to broad market risk, i.e, they have a zero beta;
(iii) the mechanism used to obtain abnormal returns is based on statistical analysis. The success
of pairs trading, especially statistical arbitrage strategies, depends heavily on the modeling and
forecasting of the spread time series although fundamental insights can aid in the pre-selection step.
Pairs trading needs not be market neutral although some say it is a particular implementation of

2

market neutral investing (Jacobs et al. 1999).

Pairs trading strategies speculate on future convergence of spread between similar securities.
Similarity concerns industry, sector, market capitalization, and other common exposures that might
imply a comovement between stocks. However a proﬁtable strategy might also be constructed with
stocks covering diﬀerent sectors based purely on statistical properties of the time series. Gatev et al.
(2006) test a simple non-parametric pairs trading algorithm on the US market between 1963 and
2002, ﬁnding average annualized returns of up to 11% for portfolios of pairs. They suggested that
the abnormal returns to pairs strategies were a compensation to arbitrageurs for enforcing the law
of one price. Another popular algorithm to select pairs is based on the presence of a cointegration
relation between stock prices (see Vidyamurthy 2004, for textbook treatment of the subject). The
use of the cointegration technique to asset allocation was pioneered by Lucas (1997) and Alexander
(1999) and in the previous decade it was increasingly applied in ﬁnancial econometrics (see, among
others, Alexander and Dimitriu 2002, Bessler and Yang 2003, Yang et al. 2004, Caldeira and Moura
2013, Galenko et al. 2012, Gatarek et al. 2014).

Many studies attempted to test the proﬁtability of pairs trading strategies. However, all them fo-
cus on either a single market studies or on a single methodology to select pairs. Do and Faﬀ (2012)
examined the impact of trading costs on pairs trading proﬁtability in the U.S. equity market and
documented that after 2002 pairs trading strategies were largely unproﬁtable. Bowen et al. (2010)
back-test a pairs trading algorithm using intraday data over a twelve month period in 2007, and
conclude that returns are highly sensitive to the speed of execution. Moreover, accounting for trans-
action costs and enforcing a “wait one period” restriction, excess returns are complete eliminated.
Broussard and Vaihekoski (2012) tested the proﬁtability of pairs trading under diﬀerent weighting
structures and trade initiation conditions using data from the Finnish stock market. Although the
proposed strategy is proﬁtable, the authors note that returns have declined in recent years possi-
ble due to increased competition among hedge funds, and/or a reduction in the importance of an
underlying common factor that drives the returns in a pairs trading strategy.

The datasets used in these analysis can be divided into two groups: First, the data comes from
developed countries which have plenty of historical ﬁnancial information available, as is the case
of the United States. The articles by Gatev et al. (2006), Engelberg et al. (2009), Huck (2010),
Do and Faﬀ (2010), Bowen et al. (2010), Do and Faﬀ (2012) are examples that use data from
the United States. The second group includes datasets from developing countries. These studies
analyse shorter time periods and a smaller number of assets in the database. Yuksel et al. (2010)
analyse pairs trading in Turkey, Broussard and Vaihekoski (2012) in Finland and Perlin (2009),
Caldeira and Moura (2013) in Brazil.

Although many papers have been written about pairs trading, the literature lacks a comprehen-
sive study of the performance of diﬀerent methodology across developed and emerging markets.
Moreover, most studies use diﬀerent trading periods, diﬀerent criteria to select assets to be included
in the sample and diﬀerent formation period, rendering a cross study comparison impossible. Since
pairs trading performance is inﬂuenced by the methodology chosen, it is important to compare
them under diﬀerent circumstances to understand if there is a overall winner, or if some strategies
are better suited to speciﬁc market conditions. We, on the other hand, use the database of an
emerging country Brazil, a developed monetary union, the Euro Area, and an important world
ﬁnancial center, the USA, along with equal parameters for each methodology in order to compare
them and test to see which is more suitable to which environment. The cointegration method
has shown results statistically superior Sharpe Ratio then the distance method for both markets
studied for all 3 portfolios formed.

The article is organized as follows. In the next section we described both pairs trading methodolo-
gies analyzed and some. Section 3 presents some implementation details common to both methods,
as well as the evaluation strategy. Section 4 describes the three large data sets used and discusses
the results of our comparison. Section 5 evaluates the performance of both methodologies and the
last section concludes with some ﬁnal remarks.

2. Pairs trading methodologies

Broadly deﬁned, there are three diﬀerent approaches to pairs trading: the distance approach, the
stochastic approach and the cointegration approach. These methods all vary with regard to how the
spread of the stock pairs is deﬁned. This paper compares two most popular methods of selecting
pairs of stocks between practitioners and researchers: the distance method proposed by Gatev
et al. (2006) and the cointegration approach used in Lucas (1997), Alexander and Dimitriu (2005),
Do et al. (2006), and Caldeira and Moura (2013). The two approaches used in this paper will be
discussed in the next subsection.

2.1. The distance approach

The distance approach is proposed by Gatev et al. (2006) and is used among others by Andrade
et al. (2005), Engelberg et al. (2009), Do and Faﬀ (2010), Bowen et al. (2010), and Broussard and
Vaihekoski (2012). By this approach the co-movement in the pair is measured by the distance,
which is deﬁned as the sum of squared deviations (SSD) between the two normalized price series.
Normalized price series are deﬁned to start from one, and then evolve using the return series. The
normalized price series for a stock is given by its cumulative total returns index over the moving
formation period of 252 days. Formally, we compute

t(cid:89)

τ =1

˜Pti =

(1 + rτ i)

(1)

where ˜Pti is the normalized price of stock i at time t, riτ is the dividend-adjusted return of stock
i at time τ , and τ is the index for all trading days between t − 252 and t. The normalized series
begin the observation period with a value equal to one, and increases or decreases each day given its
return. For each stock i, we ﬁnd the stock j that minimizes the sum of square deviations between
the two normalized price series. The distance is thus deﬁned as

252(cid:88)

(cid:16) ˜Pti − ˜Ptj

(cid:17)2

∆ij

t =

(2)

t=1

where ∆ij
is the distance between the normalized prices of stock i and j over the formation period.
t
This means that pairs are formed by exhaustive matching in normalized price space, where price
is the daily closing price adjusted for dividends and splits. We rank all possible pairs by distance,
identify the combinations with the highest measure of co-movement and monitor these pairs for
the duration of the trading period. Similar to Gatev et al. (2006), we set the periodicity of pair
updates to 20 days (approximately 1 month)

In order to select a pair for a given stock, we search on the database for an asset whose normalized
price has the smallest squared distance to the normalized price of the chosen stock up to time t.
A long-short position is opened when the distance exceeds a pre-speciﬁed threshold1 based on a
standard deviation metric. Following Gatev et al. (2006), the signal to start trading occurs when
the distance between the normalized price diverges by more than two standard deviations. An open
long-short position is closed either upon convergence in normalized prices, if a superior matching

1The threshold can be constructed in a variety of ways, but the most common method is to select some proportion of the
historical standard deviation of the spread:

q = δσspread

Gatev et al. (2006), Andrade et al. (2005) and Do and Faﬀ (2010)) set δ = 2, whereas Bowen et al. (2010) and Broussard and
Vaihekoski (2012) experiment with a range of values. It is also possible to let q be a variable by deﬁning δ as a rolling parameter
with window size n; this may allow us to better capture the proﬁt potential of periods with higher volatility in the spread.

partner is identiﬁed, or at the end of the trading period. The latter imposes a restriction on the
investment horizon and works as an automatic risk control mechanism.

The distance approach is a model free approach and non-parametrically exploits a statistical
relationship among two stocks prices. From a practical point of view, the distance method is easy
to implement and independent of economic models, which avoids misspeciﬁcation problems. On
the other hand, non-parametric strategies have lower prediction ability compared to well-speciﬁed
parametric models. The fundamental assumption of this approach is that pair spreads exhibit
mean-reversion. Accordingly, a price-level divergence is an indication of disequilibrium and price
distance is the measure of mispricing.

2.2. The cointegration approach

The use of the cointegration technique to asset allocation was pioneered by Lucas (1997) and
Alexander (1999) and in the previous decade it was increasingly applied in ﬁnancial econometrics
(see, among others, Alexander and Dimitriu 2002, Bessler and Yang 2003, Yang et al. 2004). Coin-
tegration is an extremely powerful technique, which allows dynamic modelling of non-stationary
time-series sharing a common stochastic trend. The fundamental observation that justiﬁes the ap-
plication of the concept of cointegration to the analysis of stock prices is that a system involving
non-stationary stock prices in levels can display a common stochastic trend (see ?). When com-
pared to the concept of correlation, the main advantage of cointegration is that it enables the use
of the information contained in the levels of ﬁnancial variables.

Similar to the previous trading strategy, the main concern of the cointegration approach is
the mean reversion of the spread. However, instead of deﬁning the spread as the distance between
standardized prices of a pair of stocks, the spread is deﬁned with respect to the long-run equilibrium
of a cointegrated system; that is, the long-run mean of the linear combination of two time series
(Vidyamurthy 2004). Deviations from the equilibrium should revert to the long-run mean, implying
that one or both time series should adjust in order to restore the equilibrium.

Using cointegration as a theoretical basis, the spread is generated based on the actual error term

of the long-run relation:

log(Pit) − γ log(Pjt) = µ + εt

(3)

where γ is the cointegration coeﬃcient, the constant term µ captures a possible premium in stock
t and P j
i versus stock j, and εt is the estimated error term. Thus, it is not needed to predict P i

we will have a cointegrated pair.

For detected cointegrating relations, the algorithm creates trading signals based on predeﬁned
investment decision rules. In order to implement the strategy we need to determine when to open
and when to close a position. First, we calculate the spread between the shares. The spread is
calculated as

where εt is the value of the spread at time t. Accordingly, we compute the dimensionless z-score

,

(5)

the z-score measures the distance to the long-term mean in units of long-term standard deviation.

5

July 24, 2014

Quantitative Finance

paper˙ANPEC

After selecting the most appropriate pairs, the same trading strategy used under the distance
approach is executed using the z-score series instead. This method is based on Vidyamurthy (2004),
Avellaneda and Lee (2010), and Caldeira and Moura (2013). It is an attempt to parametrize
the long-term relationship between two assets and explore price-deviations from their historical
relationship using cointegration. Even if two time series are non-stationary, cointegration implies
the possibility that a linear combination of both series could be stationary. If this is indeed the
case,The existence of both series move “closely together as if they were connected to each other.

The quality of estimation of the correction error model depends on the econometric technique
applied. The ﬁrst method for testing cointegration by Engle and Granger (1991) is a two step
procedure in which the ﬁrst step, stationarity test of the residuals errors, renders results sensitive
to the ordering of the variables, and such mispeciﬁcation error is carried to the second step, the
error correction model estimation. The way found to reduce this error is to use two cointegration
tests. Besides the Engle and Granger (1991) we also used the Johansen (1988) test, and use only
the pairs that are considered cointegrated by both tests. Nonetheless Engle and Granger (1991)
well-known limitations (small sample problems, maximum of one cointegrating vector, treating the
variables assymetricaly) are not an issue in this work, due to our samples having 252 observations,
only two variables are included in the estimation procedure, and it is only possible to ﬁnd one
cointegrating vector.

3.

Implementation Details

In this work we follow the methodology by Gatev et al. (2006), Broussard and Vaihekoski (2012)
to implement the distance method and the methodology used by Caldeira and Moura (2013),
Vidyamurthy (2004) in the implementation of cointegration methodology. The formation period
for the pairs is 12 months long, and the trading period comprises the following 6 months. The pairs
of assets are selected by minimizing the sum of squared deviations in the portfolios formed from the
distance method and ranked beginning from the smallest sum of squared deviations. In portfolios
formed from the cointegration method, the pairs are selected if they are found cointegrated with
both tests, Engle and Granger (1991), Johansen (1988), and later ranked by their Sharpe index
within the sample as in Gatev et al. (2006), Caldeira and Moura (2013).

Next, portfolios are formed with 5, 10, and 20 pairs with the lowest sum of squared deviations
and the best Sharpe ratios within the sample, and will be used in the trading period in the 6
months following the formation of pairs. At the end of each period of trading all positions are
closed. A new 12 month period for the pairs formation is created and ends on the last observation
of the previous trading period, when all cointegration tests and pairing are redone. The assets to
be used must be traded in the 12 month formation period, but not necessarily they will be listed
during the 6 month trading period.

In order to generate trading signals, it is necessary to calculate the distance between the asset
prices in the pair, measured by the spread εt = P l
t , where εt is the spread value at time t.
From the spread, the distance measure is given by the formula zt = εt−µε
. The goal is to identify
when zt departs from the long term average, given by the error correction model, measured in
terms of standard deviation. Initially, the position opens when |zt| > 2 and closes when zt = 0.

(cid:105)

This equation already includes transaction costs in its second term. To calculate the net return
of a portfolio with N pairs, we do the weighted average net returns of each pair, with the weight
deﬁned by the percentage of the amount invested in each pair with respect to the value of the
portfolio in time t. Let p be a portfolio with N pairs, where wi is the weight for each pair i.
Thus, the net return of the portfolio in t is Rp
i=1 witRit. As explained in the Caldeira and
Moura (2013), the calculation of compound return (log returns) of a portfolio of assets is, for small
values, close to the weighted average of the continuously compounded returns for each asset i.e,
Rp
i=1 witrit. However, to calculate the return accurately, log-returns are transformed back to
t
simple return, with the monthly compound rate of return, rit given by:

t =(cid:80)N

∼=(cid:80)N

rit = ln(1 + Rit) = ln

,

(7)

to transform back we just multiply by e to remove the logarithm and obtain the net return Rit.
erit = 1 + Rit =⇒ Rit = erit − 1.
From this net return of the portfolio equation, we used the weighting scheme of returns as in
Gatev et al. (2006), Broussard and Vaihekoski (2012). The scheme used is the weighting of the
returns to the capital previously committed (committed capital scheme), in which an amount of
capital is distributed evenly across the entire universe of pairs for the period. Even if the pair does
not open or if it closes before the trading period ﬁnishes, capital remains committed to that pair.
This scheme divides the payoﬀ in pairs for all pairs that were selected for the period of trading.
This method considers the opportunity cost of hedge funds when they commit resources on a pair
that ends up not being used during trading. We are conservative and assume a rate of return of
zero for capital in pairs that are not open, as in Broussard and Vaihekoski (2012), and unlike Gatev
et al. (2006), which assumes a risk-free rate of return.

The change in the weights of the pairs within the portfolio follows the method of equal weights
(Equally weighted approach), deﬁned as in Broussard and Vaihekoski (2012). That is, the sum
of returns of each pair is divided by the number of pairs that were selected for the period of
trading, in the committed capital scheme. In practice, the use of stop-loss is critical to minimize
losses. However, most academic works on pairs trading don’t use them. Exceptions are Nath (2006),
Caldeira and Moura (2013), and in this work we follow the method of Caldeira and Moura (2013)
and the stop-loss is triggered and the position in the pair is closed when losses reach 10% and we
also include a stop gain of 20% with other values being tested.1

Transaction costs considered follow Dunis et al. (2010), Caldeira and Moura (2013) and total
0.4% for each change of position in the pair (opening and closing): 0.1% brokerage in total for each
action (buying and selling), totaling 0.2% for each pair in brokerage costs. Slippage of 0.05% for
each stock in the pair, and 0.1% for the lease of the asset to be sold short (divided in 0.1% for
opening and 0.1% when closing the position). The performance of the pairs portfolios is measured
from 4 statistics:

1We considered values of 5%, 7%, 10%, 15%, 20% and no trigger for the stop-loss or stop-gain, ﬁnding that the lower/higher the
stop-loss/gain better the strategy performance being the the highest sharpe ratio when no trigger was used either for stop-loss
or stop-gain.

4. Database and empirical results

Previous pairs trading studies aimed at testing a speciﬁc methodologies for a given stock market.
However, the availability of “big” ﬁnancial datasets across the globe allows the researcher to ex-
pand the analysis to markets with diﬀerent characteristics, allowing a more robust evaluation of
the strategies. Our data comprises three highly liquid ﬁnancial markets described bellow: Brazilian,
American and Euro Area Stock Markets
BR Dataset
The database used in this study consists of all daily closing prices for stocks that have daily trading
during the 12 month formation period and are listed in the Bolsa de Valores de So Paulo (Bovespa).
The data were obtained from Economtica for the period between 1995 and 2012, and are adjusted
for dividends and splits, in order to avoid false trading signals. It is usual for some studies in pairs
trading strategies that the stocks paired are required to belong to the same industry or sector, as
in Do and Faﬀ (2010), Gatev et al. (2006). Here, due to a limited universe of assets, we do not
adopt such restriction, and as long as the pairs satisfy the cointegration criterion or belong to the
top 20 pairs that have the smallest squared deviations, they can be traded. We do not use the
risk free rate as the return on the pairs that are not being traded in order to keep the analysis as
conservative as possible.
USA Dataset
The North American database was obtained at CRSP and contains the highest most liquid stocks
for every 10 year period, totalling 4471 stocks. The period analyzed goes from 1962 to 2012 com-
prising a total of 12.586 observations. We did not limit the universe with which each stock could
pair up.
EU Dataset

The EU dataset contains daily data from the 1,000 most liquid stocks from 1973 to 2012. The
data was obtained from Datastream comprising 10,435 observations. All countries in the euro area
were considered for the sample, however not all countries have stocks in the 1000 most liquid for
the sample period. Our period has stocks from companies based in Austria, Belgium, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

4.1. Estimation and Results for the Brazilian Database

Table 2 shows the results for the selected pairs during the second semester of 2012. Although 302
pairs were considered cointegrated by the Engle & Granger and the Johansen Trace test, only the
top 20 were selected for trading based on the best Sharpe ratio in-sample. Since we did not include
any restrictions for the possible pairs a given stock may form, its interesting to see which pairs may

All pairs selected obtained positive Sharpe Ratios in-sample, but that is not necessarily true
for the performance out of sample. From the total of 20 pairs selected, to form the portfolio, 5
had negative net returns out of sample but the other pairs more than compensated for the bad
performance of those few ones, with the portfolio totalling an average net return of 10,59% during
the second semester of 2012. Most of the pairs have a half life inferior to 10, reassuring the existance
of a long run equibrium with a suﬃciently fast error correction, a very necessary characteristic for
our strategy.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show an example of the historical prices between two cointegrated stocks,
NATU3 and SSBR3, during the formation period and the subsequent trading period. The z-score is
a measure of distance from the long run equilibrium in terms of standard deviations and it crosses
the 2 standard deviation threshold more than 6 times during the trading period, indicating that
the spread widens and shortens very frequently in a given 6 month period.

Figure 1. An example for the brazilian stock market.

The portfolios created had between 5 to 20 pairs selected be it through the cointegration or
the distance method. Table 3 ﬁrst half shows the summary statistics for the portfolios created
through both methodologies. As is expected, the average number of pairs opened increases with
the number of pairs in the portfolio. Nonetheless, all other statistics remain very similar, except for
the average price deviation for opening pairs, which also increases with the number of pairs in the
portfolio. Given that every extra cointegrated pair or maatched pairs through SSD included in the
portfolio has a smaller sharpe ratio and more likely to diverge by more due to its stocks ’weaker’
comovement, it is probable that those pairs tend to diverge more from their long run equilibrium,
explaining the higher average price deviation. Each cointegrated pair had on average between 2.97
and 2.3 round trip trades depending on the size of the portfolio, which means that each pair was
traded on average more than 2 complete times each 6 months period.

Since the prices used for the distance method are normalized, the average standard deviations
are not directly comparable between the pairs selection method in Table 3. However, the average
number of pairs opened is comparable, and it shows that the distance method is more ’trigger
happy’ than the cointegration method. This selection method starts, for the 20 pairs portfolio, a
1200 pairs more than the cointegration method, possibly resulting in over trading and incurring
in excessive transaction costs. Also, these pairs remain open on average around 25 trading days,
while in the cointegration method the pairs remain open on average 16,8 days, indicating that
the distance method not only opens more pairs in a given period, it also stays longer in a open
position. Each pair was traded on average between 3.5 and 4 times each 6 months for the distance
method, meaning that in a period of an average of 120 trading days, there was room for an average
of opening a pair up to 4 times and closing it also 4 times.

The excess returns are for the whole trading out of sample, between july 1996 and december
2012 already discounted for transaction costs and slippage eﬀects. Some periods exhibit less than
20 cointegrated pairs, specialy the years between 1996 and 2002, consequently when applicable, we
used the maximun number available of pairs to form a portfolio.The average annualized return for
the cointegrated pairs dimishes with the inclusion of more pairs, from 23% with 5 pairs to 18,37%
when a portfolio consists of 20 pairs. Nonetheless, the average annualized volatility also dimishes,
from 11,20% with a portfolio of 5 pairs to 7,9% when with 20 pairs in a portfolio. Consequently, the
Sharpe Ratio for the whole sample is higher for the top 20 pairs (2,11) due to the lower volatility,
which more than compensate the lower average annualized return (18,37%). The cumulative return
between 1996 and 2012, range from 1364% for a portfolio of 20 pairs to 2499% for a portfolio with
5 pairs. The correlation with the market is slightly negative and not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
zero, exactly what we want and would expect from a market neutral strategy. The share of days
with negative returns is between 36% and 38% and very inferior to the 48% share of days with
negative returns in the Ibovespa. The maximum drawdown is also included in the summary reaching
21,68% for the all cointegrated pairs portfolios. This is a simple measure thay indicates the largest
cumulative loss after a given maximun of a cumulative positive rallying of the returns, signaling

how fast the leverage can increase, much smaller than the 65% drawdown of the Ibovespa.

The summary statistics for the pairs selected through the distance method are presented on table
3. The volatility for the portfolios created through this method is over 10% for all 3 portfolios,
higher than for the cointegration method portfolios, which range between 11,2% and 7,9%, but the
annualized average return are all inferior to the cointegrated pairs portfolios, ranging between 3,2%
and 6,4%, a little less than a third when compared with the cointegration method. The consequence
is that the Sharpe Ratios are very small, not statistically diﬀerent from the Ibovespa Sharpe ratio
of 0,58 for the whole sample. Even though the strategy is market neutral with a close to zero
Spearman rho for all 3 portfolios, the maximum drawdown is mostly higher than the ones that
occur in the cointegration method. Not only, the share of days with negative returns is over 48%
for all porfolios, similar to the Ibovespa performance, with all these statistics indicating that this
strategy is not superior than buying and holding the market index.

Table 4 shows the results found for the American data set for the whole sample period between
january 1962 and december 2012. The average number of pairs opened, just like in the other
databases, also increases with the number of pairs in the portfolio. However, both strategies perform
in a very similar way in terms of the number of pairs that open and close each trading period. The
distance method does not starts a signiﬁcant number of pairs more than the cointegration method,
with the portfolios of 5, 10 and 20 pairs starting, respectivelly 17, 32, and 74 pairs on average for
the distance method. Slightly more than the 16, 31 and 64 pairs on average for the cointegration
method with the same portfolio size. The average number of round trips per pair was between 3
and 4 for both strategies, with all portfolios having a similar number o round trips. The average
time pairs remain open in the both method is very similar, betwenn 7 and 10, with the standard
deviation slight higher for the distance method portfolios. The descriptive results for the United

States show a tendency towards similarity betwenn both strategies in terms of round trips, median
time pairs are open and they even have similarshare of negative excess returns.

The average annualized excess return for both strategies dimishes with the inclusion of more
pairs, from 10.47% with 5 pairs to 9.55% when a portfolio consists of 20 pairs in the distance
method. Nonetheless, the average annualized volatility also dimishes, from 5.54% with a portfolio
of 5 pairs to 3.13% when with 20 pairs in a portfolio. Consequently, the Sharpe Ratio for the whole
sample is higher for the top 20 pairs (2.9) due to the lower volatility, which more than compensate
the lower average annualized return (9,55%). The cumulative return between 1962 and 2012, range
from 9184% for a portfolio of 20 pairs to 13331% for a portfolio with 5 pairs. The correlation with
the market is slightly positive and not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero, exactly what we want and
would expect from a market neutral strategy. The share of days with negative returns is between
35% and 44 ˙The maximum drawdown is also included in the summary reaching 21.14% for the 5
pairs portfolios chosen by the distance method. This is a simple measure thay indicates the largest
cumulative loss after a given maximun of a cumulative positive rallying of the returns, signaling
how fast the leverage can increase.

The summary statistics for the pairs selected through the cointegration method are presented
on table 4 also. The volatility for the portfolios created through this method is betwenn 5,4% and
10,36% for all 3 portfolios, higher than for the distance method portfolios, and the annualized
average return are all inferior to the distance method pairs portfolios, ranging between3.7% and
5.5%. The consequence is that the Sharpe Ratios are also low. The cointegration method strategy
is market neutral with a market beta and a Spearman rho close to zero for all 3 portfolios and the
maximum drawdown is mostly higher than the ones that occur in the cointegration method. The
share of days with negative returns ranges between 26% and 34% for all cointegratied porfolios and
are mostly similar to the distance method portfolios. In summary, the distance method performs
better than the cointegration method for the United States, with most performance metrics being
superior and indicating a clear advantage.

Table 5 shows the results found for the european data set for the whole sample period between
january 1973 and december 2012. The average number of pairs opened, just like in the brazilian
database, also increases with the number of pairs in the portfolio. However, the diﬀerence between
both strategies is smaller. The distance method does not starts a signiﬁcant number of pairs more
than the cointegration method, with the portfolios of 5, 10 and 20 pairs starting, respectivelly 27,
54, and 105 pairs on average for the distance method. Slightly more than the 24, 49 and 95 pairs
on average for the cointegration method with the same portfolio size. The average number of round
trips per pair was slightly over 5 for the distance method and slightly under 5 for the cointegration
method, still indicating that the former tends to open more pairs then the latter. The average time
pairs remain open in the distance method portfolio is around 10 days, almost double than the 5.3
to 5.9 average days the cointegration pairs remain open, and the standard deviation of the time
open in days is around 20 days, while for the cointegration method is a little over 6 days, with such
result pointing towards the tendency for the distance approach to be more ”trigger happy” and at
the same remain longer on a given pair.

The average annualized excess return for the cointegrated pairs dimishes with the inclusion of
more pairs, from 13.73% with 5 pairs to 11.19% when a portfolio consists of 20 pairs. Nonetheless,
the average annualized volatility also dimishes, from 8.41% with a portfolio of 5 pairs to 6.15%
when with 20 pairs in a portfolio. Consequently, the Sharpe Ratio for the whole sample is higher
for the top 20 pairs (2.3) due to the lower volatility, which more than compensate the lower average
annualized return (11.19%). The cumulative return between 1973 and 2012, range from 6479% for
a portfolio of 20 pairs to 14,600% for a portfolio with 5 pairs. The correlation with the market is
slightly positive and not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero, exactly what we want and would expect
from a market neutral strategy. The share of days with negative returns is between 26% and 38%
and similar to the 29,9% share of days with negative returns in the MSCI Europe excluding UK and
Switzerland Index. The maximum drawdown is also included in the summary reaching 37,95% for
the 5 pairs cointegrated portfolios. This is a simple measure thay indicates the largest cumulative

loss after a given maximun of a cumulative positive rallying of the returns, signaling how fast the
leverage can increase, much smaller than the 65,85% drawdown of the MSCI Index.

The summary statistics for the pairs selected through the distance method are presented on table
5 also. The volatility for the portfolios created through this method is betwenn 3,4% and 5,2% for
all 3 portfolios, lower than for the cointegration method portfolios, which range between 4,5%
and 8,4%, but the annualized average return are all inferior to the cointegrated pairs portfolios,
ranging between 6,3% and 7,8%. The consequence is that the Sharpe Ratios are are increasing
with the portfolio’s size. The distance method strategy is market neutral with a market beta and
a Spearman rho close to zero for all 3 portfolios and the maximum drawdown is mostly lower than
the ones that occur in the cointegration method. The share of days with negative returns ranges
between 36% and 41% for all porfolios higher than the MSCI Index and the cointegration method.

5. Pairs trading performance evaluation

5.1. Bootstrap for assessing pairs trading performance

In order to evaluate the performance of the strategies, we compare it to a naive strategy, i.e.,
we create bootstrapped return series in which the signal to start the strategy of pairs trading is
inserted,and the performance of such a strategy is monitored and compared to the performance
of the original series of returns. We follow the method used by Gatev et al. (2006), Caldeira and
Moura (2013), in which the bootstrap initiates at the time at which the signal is sent to begin
trading pairs. In each bootstrap, the original series is replaced by two series of random assets
similar to the assets earlier, similarity being deﬁned as returns in the previous month belonging to

Table 5. Excess returns of unrestricted pairs trading strategies: european dataset

Nota: This table reports a summary statistics of the monthly excess returns on portfolios of pairs
between January 1973 and December 2012 (468 observations). Pairs are formed over a 12-month period
according to a minimum-distance criterion and then traded over the subsequent 6-month period. airs are
opened when prices diverge by two standard deviations. CAPM-estimates are from the OLS regression
analysis.

The results were calculated in every 6 month trading period and are withheld due to space
constraints and can be obtained by contacting the author. We bootstrap each period 2500 for each
of the pairs selection methodology and for each portfolio size, and found that both strategies obtain
statisticallly signiﬁcant positive performance when compared to a naive trader for both countries.
In other words, the pairs trading strategies based on the selection of pairs through cointegration and
through the distance method have a superior performance when compared to the random selection
of pairs of stocks to be traded. The average returns on the random pairs is slightly negative, possibly
due to the inclusion of transaction costs, and the standard deviations are large compared to the
pairs trading portfolio’s standard deviations.

5.2. Hypothesis testing for the diﬀerence between the Sharpe Ratios

Given that the objective of this paper is to compare the performance of two pairs selection methods,
we must use a metric in order to assess if any of the strategies has a superior performance. In order
to test the statistical signiﬁcance of the diﬀerence between the Sharpe ratios of both strategies we
use the methodology proposed in Ledoit and Wolf (2008) and obtain the p-values of the stationary
bootstrap of Politis and Romano (1994) with B = 1000 bootstrap resamples and block length b=

The whole sample result for the diﬀerence between Sharpe ratios through the methodology pro-
posed by Ledoit and Wolf (2008) indicates that for Brazil, the cointegration method is superior
during the whole sample period to the distance method. However, for the subperiods the results
are not as robust, with most subperiods results, available upon request, indicating that the coin-
tegration method does not deliver a statistically signiﬁcant higher Sharpe Ratio which hints at
the fact that some subperiods might be driving the full sample results, or that the performance is
slightly superior in each period, but not statistically higher due to sample limitations, since the size
of most subperiods sample is 120 compared to the whole period that comprises 4087 observations.
For europe the results also indicate that for the whole sample period the cointegration strategy
is superior when using a portfolio consisting of 10 and 20 pairs. However for the 5 pairs portfolio
the p-value of the statistic calculated is 0.107, and the cointegration strategy cannot be considered
superior. Also, for the 6 month subperiods the cointegration strategy in most subsample periods
is not superior, with the results most likely being driving by some subperiods. These ﬁndings hint
that the cointegration strategy may be superior to the distance method in some periods, while the
distance method may be superior in other subperiods, but on average the cointegration method
delivers a higher Sharpe Ratio. For the USA the results are the other way around. The distance
method Sharpe Ratio is statistically superior than on the cointegration method, for all 3 portfolio
sizes. However, again as in Brazil and for Europe, the results in the subperiods are mixed, with
the distance method not being superior in all 6 month subperiods (tables available upon request).

6. Conclusion

In this paper we compared two methodologies for the strategy called pairs trading. The distance
method presented in Gatev et al. (2006) and the cointegration method used by Caldeira and Moura
(2013), for the american stock market between 1962 and 2012, for the brazilian stock market
between 1996 and 2012 and for the european market between 1973 and 2012. We create portfolios
comprising 5, 10 and 20 pairs for each method, and bootstrap the results in order to compare the
their performance. The pairs were ranked by their in sample sharpe in the cointegration method
and by the smallest to the highest SSD for the distance method in order to form the portfolios. The
signal to open the position out of sample was given whenever the distance between the stocks on a
given pair crossed the 2 standard deviation threshold. Both methodologies had a good performance
when compared to a naive trader that randomly selection pairs to trade on a given period. For
Brazil, the cointegration method had a cumulative return between 1996 and 2012 of up to 2499%,
while the distance method had up to 148% of cumulative return. When compared to each other,
the cointegration method had a clear, statistically signiﬁcant higher average annualized return,
with a superior Sharpe Ratio, and, most of the time, a statistically signiﬁcant inferior volatility.
Both strategies can be considered market neutral, with a close to zero spearman correlation with
the market.

For Europe, while the results were not so clear cut, they also pointed towards the cointegation
method being superior, delivering up to 14.602% of cumulative returns against 1.860% for the dis-
tance method. The Sharpe Ratio was also considered superior for the whole sample period, although
in some subsamples both strategies were very similiar. Both strategies had an excess returns supe-
rior than a naive trader. For the United States, the results were very diﬀerent, indicating that the
distance method is superior, delivering up to 13.331% of cumulative return, more than the 1.047%
of the cointegration method. Considering that this strategy is self-ﬁnanced, since the cash obtained
by shortening a stock is used to buy the long stock in the pair, these results are encouraging and
indicate a clear path for more research regarding the drivers of such diﬀerence in performance, the
optimality of the trading thresholds and the stability of the cointegration parameters.
