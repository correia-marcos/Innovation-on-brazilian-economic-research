Abstract

This paper estimates the impact of culture on the academic performance of Brazilian
students in standardized tests. Based on data with student identification, we apply an algo-
rithm of surname classification that assigns the student, based on the surnames of his/her
parents, to one of the following ancestry groups: Iberian, Japanese, Italian, Germanic, East-
ern European and Syrian-Lebanese. We show that students with non-Iberian and Japanese
European ancestry obtain statistically and substantively higher scores on 3rd and 5th grade
standard Math tests, even with a large set of individual, family and municipal controls. We
also tested the hypothesis of persistence of local institutions, established during the era of
mass immigration in Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries, and we showed that the mecha-
nisms of family transmission of culture remain robust for students with Japanese and Italian
ancestry.

1 Introduction

Can culture explain the diversity of societal outcomes as opposed to institutions and eco-
nomic factors? This paper follows the literature on cultural transmission and explores the im-
portance of a distinct cultural trait transmitted from parents to children as an alternative and
complementary source of persistence in educational outcomes across generations. Several studies
find a persistent correlation between individual educational achievement and family socioeconomic
background (BLACK; DEVEREUX; SALVANES, 2005; JR.; LEVITT, 2004; HERTZ et al., 2008).
This research has found at most moderately-sized (and often zero) causal effects, suggesting that
much of the correlation between parents’ and children’s educational outcomes must be due to
other family characteristics, including access to high quality schools (ROUSE; BARROW, 2006),
or inherited abilities and traits (KRAPOHL et al., 2014).

We will be primarily interested in differences in culture which we define, for our purposes,
as systematic differences in preferences and beliefs across either socially or spatially differentiated
groups. Parents transmit to their children not only human capital, income, wealth, and genetic
traits but also a specific set of cultural values (BISIN; VERDIER, 2000). Vertical transmission
denotes transmission within the family – its intensity may be purposefully chosen by parents, and
tends to induce persistence. Horizontal transmission refers to the mechanism through which values
and beliefs are transmitted via social interactions with peers or with adults external to the family.
In this paper, we study the educational outcomes of higher than second-generation de-
scendants1 of immigrants.These children, born and raised in Brazil, face the institutions but they
potentially differ in their cultural heritage as reflected in their ancestors’ country of origin. The
major concern our analysis needs to address is how to separate the effects of culture from the
effects of strictly economic factors and institutions. To circumvent this problem we exploit the
difference in the “portability” of culture relative to economic and institutional conditions. When
individuals emigrate, they may take some aspects of their culture with them and transmit them
intergenerationally, while living in the economic and formal institutional environment of the host
country.This suggests that studying immigrants or their descendants may be a useful strategy for
isolating some aspects of culture. Relying on the experience of descendants of immigrants from
various countries of ancestry who live in the same country – in order to assess the effect of culture
on economic or other social outcomes – is often referred to as the epidemiological approach to the
analysis of culture.

Following Fernández & Fogli (2009), Figlio et al. (2016) and SØrensen et al. (2016), our
identification strategy relies on the opportunity to observe children whose ancestors migrated to
Brazil in the same location (same classroom), thus distinguishing between the cultural factors
from other institutional and economic factors. We explore the educational outcomes of higher
than second-generation Brazilian students in a dataset that contain individual-level administrative
data from the Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (INEP) on
3rd and 5th graders. First, this paper presents the novel use of administrative data to study the
relevance of cultural traits in explaining educational outcomes of descendants of immigrants in the
very long run. INEP data allow us to observe the entire population of public school students, and
to control for classroom and school fixed effects and several socioeconomic characteristics. Second,
we are able to follow these students over time during their primary education years, measuring
not only their educational achievement at one point in time, but also the change over time. Cross-
Studying high-order generation immigrants rather than immigrants has the benefit of minimizing shocks to
1
“normal” behavior resulting from immigration (e.g., language barriers). On the other hand, the fact that they are
second or higher-order generation descendants might weaken the strength of cultural effects on economic actions
since cultural transmission is restricted mostly to parents and ethnic social networks rather than operating in
society at large.

3

section comparisons can confound cultural transmission with unmeasured shared correlates between
parents and children, but longitudinal data permit the opportunity to explore both levels and
trajectories of outcomes. To analyze the importance of culture, we link each student within groups
of countries based on her forebears’ country of origin.

Another main problem our analysis has to deal with is how to disentangle the effects
of culture from those of local institutions2.
Immigrants might have influenced the design and
evolution of local institutions, as suggested by Kreutz (2000). Hence, cultural transmission might
be occurring horizontally. We explore data on colony settlement geographical distribution in Rio
Grande do Sul and São Paulo as instrument for local institutions. That is, if the human capital of
one’s ancestry group is an important input in the formation of one’s own human capital (as argued
by Borjas, Bronars & Trejo (1992), Borjas (1995), then systematic differences in human capital
across ancestry groups may be responsible for our results.

2 Literature review

Our paper speaks to three sets of literature. Besides being related to the literature on cul-
tural transmission (ALESINA; GIULIANO; NUNN, 2013; ALESINA; GIULIANO, 2015; ALGAN;
CAHUC, 2010; GALOR; MOAV, 2002; GALOR; MICHALOPOULOS, 2012; GUISO; SAPIENZA;
ZINGALES, 2006; NUNN; WANTCHEKON, 2011; SACERDOTE, 2005; TABELLINI, 2008;
VOIGTLÄNDER; VOTH, 2012), our paper relates to the inter-generational mobility literature
and to the research on immigrants’ assimilation. Chetty, Hendren & Katz (2016) find that local
conditions matter less for immigrants consistently with the conjecture that culture, rather than
neighborhood’s characteristics, can play an important role for immigrants. The literature on im-
migrants has systematically identified an “advantage” of some immigrant groups but, as far as
we know, no paper has identified which cultural factors may be responsible for these findings in
the very long run (CARD; DINARDO; ESTES, 1998; ABRAMITZKY; BOUSTAN; ERIKSSON,
2014).

This study also relates to the literature attempting to identify the long-term, slow-moving
determinants of economic and social outcomes, and how they are shaped by endogenous processes
and historical accidents (ENGERMAN; SOKOLOFF, 1997; ACEMOGLU; JOHNSON; ROBIN-
SON, 2002; NUNN, 2008). It also relates to a growing literature on the historical determinants
of local institutions and economic performance in Brazil. Naritomi, Soares & Assunção (2012)
study the colonial origins of institutions in Brazil looking back to the sugar-cane and gold cycles
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Musacchio, Martinez & Viarengo (2014) study the
political economy of education in Brazil during the period of increased decentralization of revenues
after the proclamation of the Republic. Carvalho Filho & Colistete (2010) study the connections
between the coffee cycle, European immigration of farm laborers and the establishment of public
instruction institutions in the state of São Paulo. Rocha, Ferraz & Soares (forthcoming) also ana-
lyzed the case of the colonies in São Paulo and found evidence suggesting the role of human capital
of immigrants in the long-term development of such areas. Carvalho Filho & Monasterio (2012)
study the long run impact of state-sponsored settlements of European immigrants in Southern
Brazil finding evidence for cultural spillovers.
2 Despite accounting for both vertical and horizontal transmissions of culture the issue of whether omitted variable

bias remains.

3 Data
3.1 Ancestry: immigration, ancestry and surnames in Brazil

Since ancestry data are not directly available, we link school records using family names,
henceforth surnames, to surname-ancestry identification algorithm proposed by Monasterio (2017).
Brazilian censuses and administrative data (such as School Census and Annual Social In-
formation Report - Relação Anual de Informações Sociais, RAIS) do not record information on
the people’s ancestry. There are just five categories of color/race, namely, white (branco), mixed
(pardo), black (preto), far-eastern (amarelo for the Chinese and Japanese) and native-Brazilian
(i.e. Amerindians, índio). 3

INEP databases provide information on the color/race for students, but not for their par-
ents. Furthermore, white (Iberian), mixed and black Brazilians do not have distinct surnames that
would make it feasible to identify their ancestry based only by piece of information. Therefore
we had to focus this paper on the students identified as white, mixed and far-eastern as a way to
overcome this limitation of the dataset.

3.1.1 Immigration to Brazil

Non-Iberian immigration to Brazil was promoted by the government when it became clear
that the days of legal slavery were counted. There were experiments of subsidized immigration
starting on the first half of the 19th century, but the main flows were concentrated after the
emancipation of slaves in 1888. Between 1872 and 1920 more than 3,2 million foreigners arrived in
Brazil (LEVY, 1974). In 1920, 5.1% of the population were foreigners or naturalized. From then
on, Brazilian legislation and public policies closed the country to immigration. In 2010, just 0.3%
of the population were born outside the Brazil.

Subsidized immigration was a positive human capital shock. Educational levels were really
low in Brazil, even compared to other poor countries (CHAUDHARY et al., 2012). In 1920, only
23% of Brazilian of all ages could read of write. In general, immigrants were not high qualified
in their home countries, but their human capital endowments were probably higher than the
Brazilians: 52% of foreigners were literate (DGE, 1929).

Were there differences in human capital or culture between immigrant groups? If so, how
to measure these differences? We resort to method proposed by A’Hearn, Baten & Crayen (2009).
It is based on a simple idea: individuals with low quantitative skills tend to round their ages in
numbers ending in 5 or 0. Therefore the distribution of the last digit of age will be skewed in favor
of these numbers in groups with low numeracy skills. The ABCC index is a measure of the degree
of the (inverse) of age heaping for groups. Its interpretation is straightforward: it varies from 0 to
100 and the higher the value, the higher the numeracy of the group (CRAYEN; BATEN, 2010).
Stolz, Baten & Botelho (2013) have estimated ABCC for immigrants using data from
arrivals in Rio de Janeiro. Their estimates suggests that numeracy skills of non-Iberian European
immigrants were much higher than the Brazilians. We follow the same method using data for
individuals born between 1860 and 1920 registered by the Hospedaria dos Imigrantes de São Paulo
(São Paulo Immigrant Hostel). This data includes internal migrants in Brazil. The results are
shown in the first column of Table 1. They result suggest that migrant Brazilians had a numeracy
level much lower than the foreign immigrants, even lower than the ones that came from Portugal
See Piza & Rosemberg (1999) and Osório (2004) for discussions on color and race in the Brazilian official

surveys.

and Spain. It is remarkable that the Japanese immigrants reached the highest scores.4

The second column of the table shows the average unweighted ABCC index for the ancestries
on their country of origin, ie. non-migrants. We have averaged the ABCC indexes for countries
available at Clio Infra between 1880 and 1920. The result sort of confirms our estimates: Brazilian
residents still have the lower numeracy levels that the European and Japanese residents. The
Syrian-Lebanese residents had astonishing low levels of numeracy.

3.1.2 Surname classification

Most children in Brazil have two surnames inherited from the mother and the father, in
that order. Ideally the full names of both parents of the student would give us the ancestry of
his four grandparents. But this is rarely the case. First of all, people may or may not adopt the
surname of the other party but traditionally women drop the surname of the mother and add that
of the husband in the surnames. As long as the maiden name of the mother is not available, we
loose her matrilineal ancestry. In fact, we had to deal with multiple possibilities.

The classification of surnames by ancestry followed the same steps as Monasterio (2017)
with some minor differences. The main idea is to build - from historical and contemporary sources
- a reference table that links each unique surname to its place of origin. This reference table plays
a role in the two main steps of surname classification:

1. Surnames on the target dataset were fuzzy matched to a database of contemporary surnames.
We have used a quite conservative fuzzy matching criterion: Optimal String Alignment (OSA)
which allows matching when the distance between the surnames are bellow 2. Distance refers
to the number of changes that are needed for the strings to become identical.

2. Surnames that failed to be matched to a nationality in the first step were classified fol-
lowing the method suggested by Cavnar & Trenkle (1994). This is a very simple and fast
method for word classification, especially when compared to other machine learning algo-
rithms (MONASTERIO, 2017). The intuition is quite simple. Surnames in the reference
table are broken into n-grams and frequency profiles of for each ancestry are created accord-
ing to the frequency of n-grams.5 Then each new surname is also broken in n-grams and
matched to ancestry.

4 ABCC index for SLB ancestry is non-available because our sample was too small
5 N-grams are sequences of characters in a word. For instance, the surname SILVA has the following 3-grams:

"SIL", "ILV" and "LVA".

6

Our reference table has 74,608 unique surnames linked to the the following ancestries:
Iberian (i.e. Portuguese and Spanish; IBR; 10,204 surnames); German (GER; 22,295); Italian
(ITA; 26,153); Japanese (JPN; 5,359); Eastern European (EAS; 7,717); and Syrian-Lebanese (SLB;
2,880)6. This covers the main ethnic groups that have arrived in Brazil during the age of migrations.
The 2013 Annual Social Information Report (Relação Anual de Informações Sociais), a
restricted-access administrative file that contains 46.8 million observations of workers in the for-
mal labor market, was our source of contemporary surnames. In RAIS there are 530,876 unique
surnames. The ancestry algorithm of surname classification outlined above was then applied to
this dataset. Finally, these pairs of surnames-ancestry were merged to the surnames of the students
and their parents in the INEP dataset.

3.2 Education

INEP administers the Brazilian national basic education evaluation system (known by its
Portuguese acronym, SAEB) that entails a biannual standardized proficiency test on Math and
reading for students from the 3rd, 5th, and 9th grades7. All students from public schools that have at
least 10 students in the 3rd grade and 20 students in the 5th grade do the exams. For the 3rd graders,
exams (ANA) are taken in only one discipline, Math or reading. Pupils are randomly assigned to
Math or reading test. Meanwhile 5th graders take Prova Brasil exams of both disciplines. This
exam data also includes contextual information obtained from 5th graders’ questionnaire, from
where we get students socioeconomic characteristics and some of theirs family rearing practices.
Although ANA and Prova Brasil grades are not in the same proficiency scale, it is arguable that
they are comparable since their contents are quite similar.

The ANA exam is the first nationwide standardized test taken by Brazilian public schools
students, when they are at the end of the 3rd grade. According to the Brazilian School Census,
in 2013, there were 2,758,968 students in the 3rd grade enrolled in public schools, corresponding
to 84.2% of the total of all 3rd graders. Of these students, 1,131,566 took the Reading test, and
1,127,076 the Math test, with 41.0% and 40.9% of coverage, respectively.

Despite the lack of a unified unique identification number for individuals in Brazil, since
2008 every student enrolled in basic education has a unique identifying code for School Census
administered by INEP8. Every school system has to inform yearly their students enrollment status.
Consequently we managed to follow the cohort of students who were enrolled in the 3rd grade in
2013 academic year back and forth, from daycare in 2008 or school entrance between 2008 and
2011 to the 2015 academic year. The students who had progressed from the 3rd grade without
repetition or dropout reached the 5th grade in 2015.

Using the individual identifying number, we merged proficiency tests microdata with school
census microdata at the individual level. From school censuses we get 3rd grade students’ surnames,
6 Monasterio (2017) does not identify Syrian-Lebanese surnames.
7 The national basic education evaluation system, SAEB (Sistema de Avaliação da Educação Básica), is composed
by three standardized proficiency tests: (i) the National School Performance Assessment (Anresc, also known
as Prova Brasil), taken by public schools 5th and 9th graders; (ii) the National Evaluation of Basic Education
(Aneb) that includes a representative sample of private schools students and smaller public schools students from
the 5th, 9th and 12th grades; and, more recently, (iii) the National Assessment of Literacy (Avaliação Nacional
da Alfabetização, ANA), taken by public schools 3rd graders. The exams are taken only in odd academic years.
We get data from 2013 Avaliação Nacional da Alfabetização - ANA, the first edition of this exam, and 2015
Prova Brasil.
INEP databases containing identification of individuals, including their parents and own names can be ob-
tained through the Research Support Service (SAP). However, researchers have to work with data inside
INEP dependencies. Further information on how to request access to the databases can be obtained at

demographic characteristics, and schooling trajectory from their entrance into Brazilian school
system, whether in daycare, kindergarten or 1st grade, to their 5th grade in the 2015 academic year.
Since census data contains student’s birth place and municipality of residence in each academic
year, the longitudinal data allowed us to recover family geographical mobility history - it was
possible to gather information about whether the student lives where he was born and whether
one’s family moved to another municipality in the period of analysis and when (2008-2015).

Considering the 3rd graders in 2013 who get to 5th grade in 2015, 2,115,542 students were
enrolled in public schools and, therefore, would be potential participants of ANA and Prova Brasil
exams, our sources of information on school proficiency. In fact, 1,592,674 of these students took
the 5th grade Math exam and 664,108 had also taken the 3rd grade Math exam, corresponding
to our sample for the analysis of the gap in terms of gains in proficiency from the 3rd grade to
5th grade between students from different ancestry. However, in order to avoid problems already
mentioned in section 3.1 and to make the students of the sample more comparable among each
other we restricted the analysis to individuals who self-declared as white, mixed or far-eastern.
Then these students were labeled according to their ancestry. The Appendix presents descriptive
statistics comparing four groups of students according to their ancestry status: (i) whether having
both parents of Iberian ancestry; (ii) having just one of them of non-Iberian ancestry; (iii) having
both parents of non-Iberian ancestry, but not the same ancestry; and (iv) having both parents of
the same ancestry.

We study the following two different outcomes: 3rd graders test scores in mathematics and
5th graders test scores in Mathematics. Studying test score growth is especially important because
test score levels might reflect some omitted variable correlated with country-of-ancestry, but it is
very rare for students to dramatically change their relative position in the nationwide test score
distribution between grades 3 and 5.

4 Empirical strategy

As discussed in the introduction, our empirical strategy is to isolate the effects of culture
from those of markets and institutions by studying the educational outcomes of children who were
mostly born in, and reside in, Brazil, but whose ancestors were born in another country.

To investigate this hypothesis, we face several challenges, for details see Fernández & Fogli
(2009), Guiso, Sapienza & Zingales (2006). First, if parents share a culture of high educational
attainment, they are likely to be highly educated and, thus, more likely to have high income
and live in areas with better schools, therefore hindering our ability to distinguish between a
transmission of cultural values and a direct effect of parental education or income. Therefore,
controlling for school and classroom fixed effects, as well as individual characteristics and measures
of family income might help us track the direct effect of culture on education. We also control
for local geographic variation in markets and institutions by including controls for municipality
characteristics and mobility controls - whether the student has moved from its place of origin in
2013 or 2015, and we cluster observations at the classroom level.

As pointed out in Figlio et al. (2016) one may object from the outset that there is no
reason to believe immigrants have the preferences/beliefs that are representative of the average
in their country of origin. This may or may not be true for different cultural attributes, but in
any case, this factor will tend to bias the test of our hypothesis toward not finding any effect of
culture on education. More importantly, for our analysis to be meaningful, culture should evolve
relatively slowly over the time period in which we are interested. Otherwise, in general, the beliefs

8

transmitted from parents to children would not be captured9.

All our regressions contain a large set of controls, including demographics (gender and age-
grade distortion and special education needs), socioeconomic status SES (measured by indicator
variables regarding availability of household goods and amenities, and parental education). Because
special education and family income are all potential consequences of parental cultural background,
we investigate the degree to which our results are driven by the decision of whether or not to control
for these variables. In our main specifications, we control for these variables.

4.1 Ancestry Dummies

Before starting our empirical analysis, we first examine whether there exist systematic dif-
ferences between each educational outcome and culture proxy. We turn to the more traditional
approach by using country-of-ancestry dummies rather than the quantitative home country vari-
ables as our cultural proxies. This has the benefit of not requiring the relationship between culture
and outcomes to be linear in the cultural proxy. Furthermore, it may allow different features of
culture to play a role in educational outcomes other than those captured past aggregate cultural
proxies. It has, however, the drawback of not specifying how culture matters. We estimate the
following model:

𝑌𝑖𝑎𝑚 = 𝛼𝑍𝑎 + 𝛽𝑋𝑖 + 𝛾𝑔 + 𝜁𝑚 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝜇𝑠 + 𝜔𝑝 + 𝜖𝑖𝑐

(1)

where 𝑌𝑖𝑎𝑚 is an outcome of interest for student i coming from ancestry a who resides in
municipality m, and 𝑍𝑎 is our measure of proxy for culture measured at the country-of-ancestry
level. 𝑋𝑖 are time invariant individual controls. Our specification also includes, a dummy indicating
whether the student is considered a Mover, a continuous variable 𝛾𝑔 reflecting past performance
in standardized Math tests, in the outcomes for which this is relevant, a full set of fixed effects to
control for specific differences in performance across different classrooms/schools. The standard
errors are clustered at the classroom level.

4.2 Variation to Culture Exposure

A potential concern with the OLS estimates reported up to this point is that the culture
proxy, assigned based on a student’s father surname, could capture some omitted ancestry char-
acteristics, in particular unobserved human capital. Following SØrensen et al. (2016) we exploit
the fact that students with parents whose ancestors originated from the same country receive
varying exposure to its culture. We compare students with one parent with non-Iberian ances-
try, two parents with non-Iberian ancestries but not identical and two non-Iberian parents with
identical ancestries, and assume that the cultural impulse is larger with two non-Iberian parents
sharing identical ancestries10. The identifying assumption is that the assignment of Iberians and
non-Iberians to one- and two non-Iberian couples is plausibly random, conditional on country of
ancestry and parental characteristics. We then repeat the previous specification replacing 𝑍𝑎 by a
set of dummies of culture exposure while keeping our controls unchanged.
9

Some cultural traits may change faster (e.g eating habits) while other (e.g fertility decisions and living arrange-
ments) may evolve at a much slower pace
It is still unclear why and how having parents sharing same set of values,norms and beliefs would, hypothetically,
render better outcomes. We aim to further investigate the interaction between ancestry and culture exposure
in future research

4.3 Institutions and Horizontal Cultural Transmission

Transmission through family ties – ie. vertical transmission – is only one of the possibilities
that values and beliefs of individuals are passed to each other. Social interactions outside the
nuclear family and institutions (in the broad sense) transmit culture as well. Immigration may
have impacted not only the ancestry of Brazilians but also its local institutions and therefore
individual test scores.

There is a vast literature on the long term impact of historical events (GUISO; SAPIENZA;
ZINGALES, 2006; ALESINA; GIULIANO; NUNN, 2013; NUNN, 2008; TABELLINI, 2008; AL-
GAN; CAHUC, 2010). According to this line of research, fortuitous or exogenous facts or decisions
show their local impact in the very long term. In the Brazilian case, the initial location of the
newly arrived may have caused changes in local institutions that persisted and show up in test
scores.

Carvalho Filho & Colistete (2010), Carvalho Filho & Monasterio (2012), and Rocha, Ferraz
& Soares (forthcoming) study the long term impact of immigration to Brazil on contemporary
data. The first paper asserts that foreign-born immigrants caused an increase in the supply of local
public instruction and this results in higher average test scores (and higher income per capita) at
the municipal level. The second paper focus on the long-term impact of subsidized immigration
to Rio Grande do Sul. Their results suggest that municipalities closer to official settlements have
better socioeconomic outcomes in 2000. Finally, the third paper shows that in municipalities in
São Paulo that received state sponsored settlements still have higher levels of schooling and income
per capita.

Here we use the data provided by Carvalho Filho & Monasterio (2012), and Rocha, Ferraz
& Soares (forthcoming) in order to disentangle the channels that relate immigration to test scores.
Both papers suggest that locations of colonies were exogenous to contemporary output variables
of interest. We will use the location of state sponsored settlements in Rio Grande do Sul and
São Paulo as a way to control for the impact of immigrant institutions on individual test scores.
Figure 1 shows the minimum distance of the centroids of municipalities of these States to any
official colony.

More precisely, we will use the ‘epidemiological’ approach: we will look at students that
were born in one municipality and go to school in another municipality as a way to identify vertical
(family) and horizontal (institutional) transmission of culture.

We test the following specification in order to estimate the effects of institutions and culture

on student achievement:

𝑌𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝜇𝑀 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖 + 𝜎𝐶𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑦𝑖 + 𝛾𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦𝑖 + 𝛽1𝑀 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖.𝐶𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑦𝑖 + 𝛽2𝑀 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖.𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦𝑖+

𝛽3𝐶𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑦𝑖.𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦𝑖 + 𝛽4𝑀 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖.𝐶𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑦𝑖.𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦𝑖 + 𝜖𝑖

(2)

where 𝑌𝑖 is the score for student i; 𝑀 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑐 is a dummy for students that study in a
municipality different from their place of birth; 𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦𝑖 is our measure of surname ancestry; and
𝐶𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑦𝑖 is the shortest euclidean distance to an state-sponsored settlement and, alternatively, a
dummy for these colonies. For the sake of simplicity, individual and municipality controls were
omitted from equation (2).

Our main interest lies in the coefficient 𝛾, because it captures the "pure" effect of family.
𝜎 identifies the effect of living in (or close to) a former colony, while 𝜇 the effect of moving.
Coefficients associated with interaction terms are useful to identify the roles of foreign ancestry
and institutions. 𝛾 + 𝛽2 is the effect on scores for students with non-Iberian ancestry that were

not born in a Colony but have moved. 𝛾 + 𝛽3 the impact for those who where born in a colony
and not moved. Finally, 𝛾 + 𝛽1 + 𝛽4 shows the effect on scores for those students with non-Iberian
ancestry that were born in a colony and have moved.

Panel A of Table 2 contains the results from the estimation of (1) by OLS with clustered
standard errors. The dependent variable is the individual Math score. Models 1 to 3 have fixed
effects at the class level. Model 4 has controls for each school just to show that results are robust.
Model 5 has fixed effects for each pair of place of birth and place of residence for the students.11
Model 1 shows that estimated coefficients for non-Iberian surname ancestry have statis-
tical and substantive significance. Students with Japanese surname ancestry get 22 % standard
deviations higher than their peers with Iberian surnames.
11 The number of observations change because individual controls are available only for those students that took

Prova Brasil and answered the socioeconomic questionnaire.

As expected, the inclusion of controls for individual characteristics, family socioeconomic
status and municipality controls 12 reduces the size of the coefficients; Syrian-Lebanese surnames
lose statistical significance. We must stress the result in Model 5. We are comparing students
that not only share the same observable individual and family characteristics, but were born and
study in the same pair of municipalities. Even in that full specification the coefficients for surname
ancestry remain stable and significant.

Models 1 to 5 in Panel B of 2 have the same controls of Panel A with two major differences:
dependent variable is the 5th grader Math score and we are controlling for the Math score that the
same student got 2 year earlier (ANA 2013 Math score). Estimated coefficients associated with
ancestry variables retain the general pattern. Interestingly, coefficients associated with Germanic,
Italian, and Eastern European ancestry have dropped. However coefficients for Japanese have
grown ever more and for Syrian-Lebanese have become statistically significant. The fact that
ancestry dummies remain significant after the inclusion of past scores suggest that the effects of
ancestry take a while to have full effect.

Table 3 aims to test if the "dosage" of cultural ancestry impacts the test scores of students.
So we repeat the same empirical strategy of 2 but now with three dummy variables: "One Ancestry"
when the student has only one parent with non-Iberian surname; "Two Ancestries (same)" when the
parents share the same ancestry; and "Two Ancestries (not same)" when the student parents have
non-Iberian ancestries but they are different. The reference, obviously, are the students without
non-Iberian surnames.

Results on dosage are quite robust. According to Panel A of 3 having one parent with
non-Iberian surname is associated with higher scores, but two parents seem to increase the results
even more. Besides, when both parents share the same non-Iberian ancestry there is an additional
effect. We have no clear hypotheses for the reason of this effect.

All models in Panel B of Table 3 includes the previous test scores of student. Coefficients
associated with ancestry dosage drop in value but remain significant. Again, this result indicates
that the cultural effects of ancestry on tests scores grow with time.

5.2 Family and Institutions

In this section we check if the impact of family ancestry is robust to the inclusion of variables
that control for local institutions. As we have said, we have opted for very simple proxies for non-
Iberian institutions: a dummy if the municipality have a ever received a government sponsored
settlement and the minimum distance to any of this colonies.13

The results in Panel A and B of Table 4 can not compared to the ones in Table 2 because
our sample includes only Rio Grande do Sul and São Paulo. Column 1 is now our benchmark
specification, ie without controls for institutions. In this restricted sample only the coefficients for
Japanese and Italian surname ancestries remain significant. The variable of interest in Models 2-6
is 𝛾 of 2; which means the direct impact of the family when we control for all interactions between
ancestry, movers and those who were born in a former settlement.

The comparison of the column 1 with 2 and 3; and 4 with 5 and 6 shows some increase in
the coefficients associated with Japanese and Italian ancestry. The inclusion of our institutional
proxies suggest that vertical transmission of culture remains for these groups even with full controls.
13 We could not create proxies for distance to each type of colony because Rocha, Ferraz & Soares (forthcoming)

do not provide information on the country of origin for all the settlements in their dataset.

For the sake of completeness, Panel B of Table 4 repeats the "exposure" estimations of
Table 3 including our institutional variables. The ordering of coefficients is the same as before.
Controlling for institutions, students with parents with the same non-Iberian ancestry have the
highest scores, followed by those with parents with different non-Iberian ancestries, and those with
one non-Iberian parent.

6 Final remarks

This paper sheds light on the role of culture in explaining the diversity of educational
outcomes among primary school students in Brazil. This is the first attempt, to our knowledge, of
using individual-level data to study the impact of distinct cultural traits on academic achievement.
Leveraging the capabilities of a surname-based matching algorithm we were able to identify the
ancestry of major immigrant groups that arrived in Brazil in the turn of the XIX century and the
beginning of the XX century.

In order to isolate the effect of culture from those of institutions and markets we follow two
avenues. First, we follow Fernández & Fogli (2009), Figlio et al. (2016), SØrensen et al. (2016)
and use the epidemiological approach to study higher than second-generation Brazilians. Second,
even though the epidemiological approach allow us to control for the Macro institutional setting,
we explore the historical episode of mass migration to disentangle potential persistent effects of
culture from those of local institutions, in the lines of Tabellini (2008), Guiso, Sapienza & Zingales
(2006) and control for colonial settlements and presence of movers in our data.

Our results suggests that there is an Ancestry premium in educational performance. Us-
ing Iberian Brazilians as our reference group, we provide evidence that students bearing either
non-Iberian europeans (Germanic, Italians, Eastern Europeans) or japanese ancestries achieve
substantially higher scores in Mathematics standardized test conducted at 3rd and 5rd grades. Not
only it seems to exist a gap, but as the students move up from 3rd and 5rd the gap gets wider.
These results are robust to several specifications, including individual and family controls, as well
as municipality and mobility controls. It is noteworthy, that the results stands while using class-
room fixed effects (i.e, controlling for teacher quality, classroom size and so forth). Implications in
terms of social inequality is therefore paramount.

To test the strength of our argument, we also proceed to control for potential interaction
between ancestry and local institutions. Performing this analysis for the States which we have
data on exact location of colonial settlements we show that, students bearing either japanese or
italian ancestries seems to hold the effect of culture, implying a stronger vertical transmission of
preferences and beliefs(ie. within family). On the other hand, Germanic and Eastern Europeans
descendents exhibit statistically insignificant coefficients for our culture proxy, which might suggest
that horizontal rather than vertical transmission is occurring.

Additionally, we explored the role of variation in culture exposure, regardless from which
ancestry group the student belongs, and we found statistically significant results pointing to a
monotonically increasing differential between those students with one foreign ancestry, two non-
identical foreign and two identical ancestries.

We have been able to investigate whether culture matters for educational performance.
Future research, might indicate How and Why it matters.It might be that parenting skills are
important, discrimination or unobserved human capital are actually playing along with our culture
proxy. Moreover if there is gap between students, there is also a room for policy aiming to mitigate
this educational differential, that may impact income distribution and social mobility in the long-
run.
