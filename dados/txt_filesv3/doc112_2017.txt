ABSTRACT 
 
The  main  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  investigate  empirically  the  joint  effects  of  the  manufacturing 
industries  and  real  exchange  rate  (RER)  on  the  real  per  capita  income  growth  rate  and  economic 
complexity for a diversified sample of countries. It can be highlighted three contributions in the present 
work. Firstly, taking in account different technological gap levels in dynamic panel models (GMM) was 
found  that  manufacturing  is  the  prominent  tradable  sector  to  achieve  greater  real  per  capita  income 
growth rate, independently of the magnitude of the technological gap considered. This fact supports the 
“engine of growth” hypothesis concerning manufacturing for the sample of developing countries and the 
period of study. Secondly, the farther the distance of the countries´ sample in relation to the technological 
frontier considered, the greater the positive effect of the lagged undervalued RER on the real per capita 
income growth rate. Finally, the Dumistrescu and Hurlin (2012) causality tests for heterogeneous panel 
data  indicate  that  the  manufacturing  industries  share  to  GDP  in  developing  economies  are  especially 
important for the higher level of economic complexity in a mutual causation.  
 
Key words: Economic growth, productive structure, technological gap and real exchange rate.

RESUMO 
 
O  principal  objetivo  do  presente  artigo  é  investigar  empiricamente  os  efeitos  da  estrutura  produtiva 
industrial (manufatureira) e da taxa de câmbio real (RER) sobre a taxa de crescimento real do produto per 
capita e o nível de complexidade econômica para uma amostra diversificada de países. Três contribuições 
podem  ser  destacadas  no  presente  trabalho.  Primeiramente,  considerando-se  diferentes  níveis  do  hiato 
tecnológico em painéis dinâmicos (GMM) constatou-se que a indústria manufatureira é o setor tradable 
fundamental  para  maiores  níveis  da  taxa  de  crescimento  real  do  produto  per  capita,  independente  da 
magnitude  do  hiato  tecnológico  considerado,  corroborando  a  hipótese  de  “engine  of  growth”  para  o 
período  e  a  amostra  de  economias  em  desenvolvimento  estudadas.  Outra  contribuição  do  presente 
trabalho  é  que  quanto  maior  a  distância  dos  países  em  relação  à  fronteira  tecnológica,  maior  o  efeito 
positivo da taxa real de câmbio depreciada defasada em relação à taxa de crescimento real do produto per 
capita. Por fim, vale destacar que os testes de causalidade de Granger de Dumistrescu e Hurlin (2012) 
para dados em painel indicam que a participação da indústria manufatureira no produto das economias em 
desenvolvimento  é  importante  para  o  maior  nível  de  complexidade  econômica  das  mesmas  de  forma 
bicausal.

INTRODUCTION 
 
 
The  manufacturing  industries  central  role  to  economic  growth  and  the  technological  catching  up 
process are highlighted in Szirmai (2012), Thirlwall (2005) and Tregenna (2009), among others, through 
stylized  facts  and  empirical  analysis.  In  these  studies  it  is  clear  that  the  process  of  economic  growth 
depends  of  the  productive  structure  composition  and,  especially  for  the  developing  economies,  the 
industry is an important source of long-term growth1.  
 
According  to  Rodrik  (2016)  manufacturing  tends  to  experience  relatively  stronger  productivity 
growth  and  technological  progress  over  the  medium  to  longer  term.  So,  premature  deindustrialization 
blocks off the main way of fast economic convergence in low and middle income countries.  
 
In Rodrik (2009 and 2016) it can be seen that the rapid economic growth of developing economies 
since the 1960s is associated with the largest transfer of productive resources (labor and capital) to the 
most modern industries. In this sense, the structural shift toward industrial activities worked as a driver of 
economic growth.  
 
Szirmai (2012) presents a series of empirical and theoretical arguments about the role of industry as 
the “engine of growth” in developing economies. Basically, productivity in this economic sector is higher 
than in agriculture because the transfer of resources from this sector to the industry provides a “structural 
change bonus”. This “bonus” comes as a result of the transfer of work from economic activities with low 
productivity  to  high  productivity  activities.  This  automatically  raises  the  overall  productivity  of  the 
economy. However, the pattern of structural change also at some point directs resources to the services 
sector, so the countries begin to experience some “burden” in relation to this structural change because  
productivity growth in this sector is usually lower than in the industrial sector, 
 
The manufacturing sector, in particular, offers special opportunities for economies of scale, which 
are less available in agriculture or  in the services sector, according to Szirmai (2012).  In  addition, the 
manufacturing sector offers greater opportunities for the advancement of technologies incorporated in the 
goods and presents greater technological diffusion capacity to other sectors. Part of this dynamic occurs 
because  of  the  so-called  productive  linkages  and  spillover  effects,  which  are  stronger  within 
manufacturing industries2. 
 
Felipe Leon-Ledesma, Lanzafame and Strada (2009) used the Kaldorian theoretical framework to 
analyze the Asian performance from its structural change perspective3. According to them the economic 
growth verified in the panel of countries was strongly associated with the increasing industrial share in 
the economies studied (Kaldor´s first Law). 
More specifically, in Felipe et al. (2009) the sector with the greatest economic growth elasticity, 
 
after controlling for other variables and exogenous shocks, was the industrial sector as a whole, followed 
by the service sector and then the activities of the manufacturing industries. The greater elasticity of the 
industrial sector in relation to the manufacturing sector was due to the forward and backwards linkages of 
the  activities  related  to  electricity  and  infrastructure  economic  activities.  Moreover,  this  feature  of  the 
industry is based on the fact that the accumulation of capital and technical progress have been stronger in 
this sector, having important spillovers effects to the rest of the economies in the sample of countries. 
 
According to Rowthorn and Ramaswamy (1997) the process of economic growth depends on the 
productive structure composition and at different stages of development certain sectors are dominant in 
terms of its influence on per capita income growth rate. However, the role of manufacturing as a driver of 
this growth (“engine of growth”) depends of the level of technological gap and the real exchange rate, 
which influence its competitiveness.  
 
The  non-price  competitiveness  of  tradable  products  depends  largely  on  the  technology  gap.  The 
greater  the  distance  of  one  country  concerning  a  technological  frontier,  the  lower  tends  to  be  the 

  

                                                           
1  According to Rodrik (2016) it was the industrialization process that permitted catching up and convergence with the West by 
non-Western nations, such as Japan in the late 19th century, South Korea, Taiwan and China, among others countries.  
2 In this work the term industry refers to the divisions 10-45 of the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) and 
when referring to the manufacturing industries are being considered the divisions 15-37 of the International Standard Industrial 
Classification (ISIC).

technological  cumulativeness  (i.e.  technological  learning  capabilities)  and  thus  lower  the  non-price 
competitiveness. Moreover, the price competitiveness of these products depends on the real exchange rate 
(RER) level as overvalued exchange rates leads to a progressive reduction in the share of manufacturing 
industry and induces an increasing transfer of production activities to other countries4. 
 
In  view  of  this  literature,  the  main  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  investigate  the  joint  effects  of 
manufacturing industries and the real exchange rate (RER) on the per capita income growth rate and the 
level of economic complexity for a sample of underdeveloped countries from 1990 to 2011. The level of 
economic complexity developed by Hausmann and Hidalgo et al. (2011) provides empirical support for 
the  Kaldorian  grounds,  which  understands  the  productive  sophistication  as  one  of  the  important 
conditions for higher levels of per capita income growth rate for developing economies.  
Hausmann and Hidalgo et al. (2011) developed a measure of economic complexity which diversity 
 
and  ubiquity  are  approximations  of  the  variety  of  capabilities  available  in  an  economy.  Whilst  more 
diversified and less ubiquitous products tend to demand large quantities of capabilities and knowledge, 
such as an aircraft, more ubiquitous products (e.g. cloths) or less ubiquitous products based on scarcity, 
such as niobium (and other natural resources), reflects the need of less capabilities and knowledge5. 
As further will be discussed in the next section,  despite the empirical evidences and stylized facts 
 
regarding  the  importance  and  successful  development  strategies  based  on  the  manufacturing  sector  as 
engine  of  growth,  there  still  remains  a  lack  of  robust  empirical  content  to  present  how  this  sector 
influences productive sophistication besides economic growth. In order of doing so, it will be tested how 
economic complexity responds to manufacturing, technological gap, undervalued exchange rate and the 
per capita income growth rate (besides the interrelationship among these variables in term of causality).  
 
To  fulfill  the  proposed  objectives,  this  article  is  divided  into  6  other  sections  besides  this 
introduction.  Section  2  presents  the  theoretical  background  concerning  to  the  relationship  between 
productive structure composition and economic growth. Section 3 presents the baseline empirical model, 
data  sources  and  all  variables  to  be  used  in  the  next  sections.  Section  4  presents  an  analysis  through 
dynamic  panel  method  (GMM)  for  a  sample  of  84  countries  to  analyze  the  relationship  of  per  capita 
income  growth  rate  and  manufacturing  industries  among  different  levels  of  technological  gaps  and 
considering the effects of RER. Section 5 presents the Granger causality tests for heterogeneous panels 
from Dumitresco and Hurlin approach (2012) in a reduced sample (64 countries) taking into account the 
level of economic complexity as a proxy for productive sophistication. Through this test it can be checked 
more  adequately  the  robustness  of  the  results  obtained  in  the  previous  section  meanwhile  it  tests  the 
hypothesis of the relationship between manufacturing and the level of production sophistication. Finally, 
in Section 6 some conclusions are drawn.  
2. PRODUCTIVE STRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH  
 
In the early stages of economic development the agricultural sector is dominant both in terms of 
employment as in the value added share. According as the per capita income growth the sector with the 
highest relative share becomes the industrial. Rowthorn and Ramaswamy (1997) highlighted two factors 
that explain this change: i) the effect of Engel Law, i.e., the proportion of income spent on goods from the 
agricultural  sector  declines,  while  the  per  capita  income  increases,  causing  a  change  in  the  pattern  of 
demand for agricultural products toward industrial goods and services and ii) on the supply side, the fast 
growth  of  labor  productivity  in  agriculture  makes  a  reduced  need  for  workers,  moving  them  to  the 
services activities, but especially for the industrial sector, in the early stages of industrialization. 
 
This last factor is called by Szirmai and Verspagen (2011 and 2015), Szirmai (2012) and Syrquin 
(1984 and 1988) of “structural change bonus”. This effect is temporary, lasting only while the share of 
manufacturing  industry  is  increasing.  The  transfer  of  resources  from  manufacturing  industries  to  the 
services  activities  generates  a  “burden”  related  to  structural  change,  known  in  economic  literature  as 

 

 

                                                           
4 See Palma (2005) and Bresser-Pereira (2010), for example, for this process.  
5  Of  course,  low  ubiquity  can  come  from  the  need  of  large  capabilities  and  knowledge.  In  this  case  the  products  are  more 
complex, such as X-Ray Machines, computerized tomography machines (CAT scan).

Baumol disease (Baumol, 1967), in which, with the growth of the services activities, the growth rate of 
income per capita tends to decline. 
 
The  combined  effect  of  these  two  factors  highlighted  by  Rowthorn  and  Ramaswamy  (1997) 
generates  a  decrease  both  in  absolute  and  in  relative  terms  of  employment  and  value  added  of  the 
agricultural sector for the industry. After a certain level of economic development the industry declines, 
i.e., there is a process of deindustrialization. 
 
Rowthorn and Ramaswamy (1997) formalized the economic growth process, in which there is an 
increase in the industrial sector share in the early stages of economic development and subsequently de-
industrialization and transition to an economy where the services sector it is dominant in the later stages. 
Thus, the authors present formally that “deindustrialization” may occur as a result of successful economic 
development. Similarly, Rowthorn and Wells (1987) also explain that this process may be related to a 
higher stage of development where the standard of per capita income is, as a rule, higher. 
 
Kaldor (1966) noticed this phenomenon between 1950 and 1965 in the UK economy, which grew 
more slowly than other advanced economies. The main reason was related to the level of “maturity” of 
the British economy at the time. This “maturity” was related to the high level of per capita income in the 
period, the lack of labor reserves in low-productivity sectors (as in agriculture) that could be transferred to 
the industrial sector. In this context, the economic growth rate was reduced due to the slowdown in the 
manufacturing industry. 
 
The decreasing share of manufacturing industries in the developed economies was mainly in the late 
1960s and throughout the 1970s, as analyzed in Rowthorn and Ramaswamy (1997) and Szirmai (2012). 
However, it was not linked to a change in terms of the aggregate consumption pattern of the industrial 
sector  to  the  services  sector  or  the  pattern  of  North-South  international trade,  but  reflected  mainly  the 
impact  of  differential  productivity  growth  (and  technological  progress)  between  manufacturing  and 
services.  This  productivity  increased  consistently  faster  in  manufacturing.  Then,  the  services  sector 
absorbed a greater proportion of employment just to keep its output rising (Rowthorn and Ramaswamy, 
1997, p.12 and Rodrik, 2016, p.3). 
According to Szirmai and Verspagen (2011 and 2015) and Szirmai (2012), after the Second World 
 
War,  industry  (and  manufacturing,  in  particular),  has  emerged  as  the  main  economic  activity  of  many 
developing  countries,  shaping  a  new  international  trade  structure  and  productive  specialization.  Some 
developing  countries  in  the  period  experienced  a  rapid  process  of  catching  up  and  increasing  income, 
which  was  linked  to  the  industrialization  process  that  began.  This  view  is  in  line  with  the  economic 
growth process in the  Kaldorian tradition where is in the manufacturing industries that there are more 
opportunities for capital accumulation, static and dynamic economies of scale, more intense technological 
progress and spillover effects (Kaldor, 1966 and 1967). 
 
In general, in the case of several Latin American countries, this process of increasing industry share 
in the economy occurred by import substitution industrialization (ISI) as a necessary first step to build a 
local  production  base,  essential  for  the  countries  insertion  in  the  international  markets.  In  some  Asian 
countries,  such  as  South  Korea,  a  growth  strategy  led  by  exports  was  persecuted  (i.e.  export-led 
strategies). Also, undervalued RER, according to Woo (2004) and Gala (2008), was critical to the highest 
rates  of  economic  growth  observed  in  Asian  countries.  Over  the  past  30  years,  while  Latin  American 
countries, in general, were focused on an inward industrialization, Asian countries (such as South Korea 
and Taiwan) pursued a growth strategy led by exports, with heavy incentives for exporters and industry 
and competitive real exchange rates (Gala, 2008, p.286 and Rodrik, 2006, p.20). 
 
In Latin American countries the decline of industry share occurred at a level of per capita income 
much lower. Moreover, over the past decades this process of reduction in the share of manufacturing and 
industry as a whole in these economies was due to a number of causes such as persistent exchange rate 
misalignment (overvalued), technological asymmetries (i.e. high technological gap), financial openness 
and terms of trade appreciation (Palma, 2005 and Bresser-Pereira and Marconi, 2008). 6  
                                                           
6 For a thorough analysis of  the causes of deindustrialisation processes at the international level, see  Rowthorn and  Coutts 
(2004) and Palma (2005). Although it is discussed briefly here the “early” deindustrialization, the main focus is on industry 
(especially the manufacturing) as a dynamic sector (s) and driver (s) of economic growth, as we highlighted in the literature on 
this subject in this section.

Rodrik  (2016,  p.4)  points  that  as  these  economies  opened  to  international  trade  without  a  strong 
comparative advantage in manufacturing, they became net importers, reversing a long process of import 
substitution  industrialization.  Besides,  most  developing  countries  “imported”  deindustrialization  from 
advanced countries as they became exposed to the relative price trends produced in the latter. This decline 
in the relative prices in the advanced economies put a profit squeeze on manufacturing in the developing 
economies, mainly in the countries where the technological gap were greater. The consequences of these 
processes  are  the  strong  reduction  in  employment  and  value  added  share  of  this  sector  in  developing 
countries. 
This  reduction  in  the  manufacturing  share  in  lower  levels  of  economic  development  in  Latin 
 
America and others developing economies has long-term consequences in terms of its economic growth 
potential and reducing technological asymmetries, that is, the chances of technological catching up and 
income  convergence  are  diminished  or  unsustainable  (falling  behind  situation).  This  is  because  the 
transfer  of  resources  and  labor  from  manufacturing  sectors  to  lower  productivity  activities  (such  as  in 
agriculture and mining or lower skilled services) can produce a smaller growth rate of per capita income, 
as well as a lower level of productive sophistication, such as measured by Hausmann and Hildalgo et al. 
(2011). 
 
Despite of the empirical evidences and stylized facts above mentioned regarding the importance and 
successful  development  strategies  based  on  the  manufacturing  industries  as  engine  of  growth  and  the 
negative effects of the premature decrease of its GDP share, there still remains a lack of robust empirical 
content to present how this sector influences productive sophistication.  
With the economic complexity indicator of Hausmann and Hildalgo et al. (2011) it is possible to 
 
test  whether  the  level  of  productive  sophistication  proxied  by  this  indicator  is  affected  by  the  relative 
share of manufacturing industries in a heterogeneous sample of developed and developing countries. 
 
The  level  of  complexity  of  economies  is  measured  in  terms  of  the  product  composition  of  their 
productive structures taking into account the diversity and ubiquity of tradable products.7 The greater the 
diversity of products that require know-how, technologies and knowledge and lower the ubiquity of these 
products  (not  based  on  scarcity),  the  higher  the  economic  complexity  level  tends  to  be.  This  variable 
measures  indirectly  the  level  of  sophistication  of  the  productive  structure  of  the  countries  because  it 
considers the ubiquity and diversity of tradable production as dependent on the specialization level and 
the stock of knowledge. 
 
In the context of this discussion, in section 4 it is empirically investigated the relationship between 
the per capita income growth rate and manufacturing considering different levels of technological gap and 
the effect of the real exchange rate (RER), taking into account a set of control variables through dynamic 
panels.  In  section  5  it  is  tested  the  interrelationship  between  the  per  capita  income  growth  rate, 
technological gap, manufacturing, real exchange rate (RER) and economic complexity (used as a proxy 
for  productive  sophistication)  through  Granger  causality  tests  for  panel  data.  Before  the  empirical 
estimates in Section 4 and 5, in section 3 are presented the baseline model, the variables, sources and the 
control. 
3. BASELINE MODEL, VARIABLES, SOURCES AND CONTROLS 
 
 
The contributions of manufacturing to economic growth can be measured using growth accounting 
techniques and econometric analysis. The first method analyses what proportion of growth stems from 
each sector. However, this method tends to underestimate the contributions of structural change and the 
emergence of dynamic sectors because they do not take in consideration external effects and intersectoral 
spillovers (Szirmai and Verspagen, 2010, p.12-13). Besides, the econometric analysis is more adequate to 
take into account exogenous and endogenous factors that may contribute positively or hinder economic 
growth.  
                                                           
7  The  construction  of  this  indicator  is  based  on  international  trade  data.  The  justification  of  Hausmann  and  Hidalgo  et  al. 
(2011) for this is that these data have a standardized classification linking countries to their products. In principle, if countries 
produce  goods  that  do  not  export,  they  are  not  so  specialized  in  terms  of  quality  and/or  there  is  a  lack  of  international 
competitiveness. Finally, Hausmann and Hidalgo et al. (2011) emphasize that this indicator does not take into account non-
tradable data due to a limitation of the majority of countries regarding the quantity and quality of the data available.

Concerning the last method, Fagerberg and Verspagen (1999 and 2002), Rodrik (2009), Tregenna 
(2009) and Szirmai and Verspagen (2010 and 2011) found mixed results for different periods and using 
different  estimation  techniques.  This  mixed  results  occurred  because,  as  highlighted  by  Szirmai  and 
Verspagen  (2010,  p.13),  manufacturing  industries  tended  to  be  the  driver  of  growth  in  developing 
countries  mainly  in  the  period  1950-1973  but  not  in  greater  intensity  after  1973.  After  1973,  ICT 
(Information  and  Communications  Technology)  became  more  important  as  a  source  of  productivity 
growth. Moreover, these technologies were not (are) explored only in the manufacturing industries. This 
fact gave rise to service-led period of growth, as in India (Dasgupta and Singh, 2005). 
Based on these findings, the baseline empirical model of the present work is an expanded version 
 
from  Szirmai  and  Verspagen  (2010  and  2011).  Basically  they  estimate  panel  regression  models  with 
fixed, random and between effects for different samples between 1950-2005 using five years period, for 
groups of countries for Asia, Latin America, Africa. Their dependent variable were the growth of GDP 
per capita and the covariate the shares of manufacturing and services. The control variables were GDP per 
capita to the US and education levels.  In Szirmai and Verspagen (2011) the control variables were human 
capital at the beginning of each five  years period, the log of the population size, climate zone and the 
degree of openness. 
 
Differently of Szirmai and Verspagen (2010 and 2011) we use the methodology of dynamic panel 
(GMM) which allows to control for individual unobserved characteristics of the sample that affect the 
dependent variable and the possible endogeneity of independent variables8. Differently from the above 
mentioned  empirical  works,  we  test  the  effects  of  RER,  sectorial  shares  and  other  control  variables 
considering different technological gaps from 1990-2011 (n=84 and T=22, in section 4).  Furthermore, in 
section  5  is  applied  the  Granger  non-causality  test  for  heterogeneous  panels  with  fixed  coefficients 
recently  proposed  by  Dumitrescu  and  Hurlin  (2012).    By  doing  so,  it  is  tested  the  interrelationships 
between the per capita income growth rate, technological gap, manufacturing and economic complexity 
(proxy for productivity sophistication).  
 
The  estimators  for  dynamic  panels  of  Arellano  and  Bond  (1991)  are  efficient  estimators  called 
Generalized  Method  of  Moment  (GMM)  widely  used  in  empirical  researches  in  cases  where  it  is 
observed, according to Roodman (2009): i) periods (T) smaller than the number of individual units (n); ii) 
linear functions; iii) lagged dynamic variable, i.e., influenced by their own past values; iv) independent 
variables that are not strictly exogenous and can be correlated with its past values and possibly current 
realizations  of  the  error  term;  v)  individuals  fixed  effects;  vi)  heteroskedasticity  and  within 
autocorrelation;  vi)  some  variables  can  be  predetermined,  but  not  strictly  exogenous,  so  that  may  be 
influenced  by  its  past  values;  vii)  possibility  of  “internal”  instruments,  i.e.  based  on  their  own  lagged 
variables or “external” instruments. 9  
 
Arellano and Bond (1991) procedure for the dynamic panel data estimation): 

Given  these  estimator´s  features  and  the  objectives  of  the  next  section,  it  is  used  the  standard 

random variable that captures the unobserved characteristics or heterogeneity of each country that affects

where  i=1...,N,  t=1...,T,  j=6,...,K.  In  (1)  the 𝛽𝑗´s  and 𝜉 are  the  parameters  to  be  estimated, 𝑢𝑖𝑡  is  the 
random  disturbance,  which  captures  the  unobserved  factors  on  the  independent  variable  and 𝑐𝑖  is  a 
the per capita income growth rate. 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐𝑔𝑖𝑡 is the real per capita GDP growth, misxrate represents the 
𝐸(𝑋𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑖𝑡)≠0. As in the dynamic model it will be taking into account the income per capita growth rate lagged effects on the 
error  term 𝑐𝑖.  The  traditional  sources  of  endogeneity  are  due  to  dynamic  effects  such  as  the  cited,  simultaneity  between

variables, omitted variables or measurement errors of variables. 
9 A potential disadvantage for this class of estimators is that they can easily generate invalid estimates depending on model 
specifications, as Roodman (2009) explains.   

present, the conventional method (OLS) to panel data leads to inconsistent estimates, since this variable is correlated with the

working with the industry assumption of “engine of growth”, since the main implications of this sector on 
growth is captured by its relative share by this measure. According to Tregenna (2009, p.439-441): 

The use of value added for the tradable and non-tradable sectors is particularly important when 

i)  the effects of the industry on growth through forward and backward linkages are more strongly 
linked to its economic effect in terms of value added: even if this economic sector lowers its 
employment share, it can increase the value added share and rise the demand for capital goods 
and the amount of raw materials in the upstream sector besides promoting incentives to reduce 
costs in downstream sectors;  

 

ii) the  effects  of  the  economies  of  scale  and  learning-by-doing  (stronger  in  this  sector)  on  the 
industry growth in terms of value added  and increased production are compatible with lowers 
employment  levels,  so  the  sector  can  increase  its  share  in  terms  of  value  added,  without 
necessarily  having  a  constant  or  increasing  share  of  workers  and  as  technical  progress  and 
innovation are particularly important in this sector it follows that it is also compatible with the 
expansion of the manufacturing industry in terms of production and value added while reducing 
the share of workers employed.  

 
The technological gap (gaptec) is defined following the methodology used by Verspagen (1991), 
 
Verspagen (1993), Fagerberg (1994), Fagerberg and Verspagen (2002) and Fagerberg, Srholec and Knell 
(2007), among others. In this case the technological leader is the United States and its per capita GDP is a 
proxy  for  productivity.  Thus,  the  technological  gap  is  measured  by  the  ratio  of  USA  per  capita  GDP 

compared to other country per capita GDPs, such that 𝐺=(𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐𝑈𝑆𝐴 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐𝑖𝑡

 
The assumption behind this measure is related to the way the evolutionary approach works with the 
idea  of  technological  gap.  They  relate  the  technological  level  of  each  productive  system  with  its 
innovative  activities:  a  high  level  of  innovative  activity  means  a  greater  share  of  “new”  products  in 
relation to GDP and a further extension of the use of “new” techniques in the production process. Since 
these new goods and techniques involve a higher level of prices and productivity, respectively, it follows 
that countries with higher levels of innovative activities tend to display higher value added  per worker or 
per capita income than others. 
The  variable  misxrate  was  constructed  following  the  methodology  proposed  by  Rodrik  (2008). 
 
Applying this methodology is possible several comparisons in the relevant literature between panels of 
countries over time. This variable is essentially the real exchange rate adjusted by the Balassa-Samuelson 
effect, that is, a real exchange rate adjusted by the relative prices for the tradables sectors in relation to 
non tradables11. So, the misxrate variable represents an indicator of undervaluation (misxrate).

10 The control varibles are infla, humank, govexp, ttrade, ainv e govexp.   
11  Béla  Balassa  (1964)  and  Paul  Samuelson  (1964),  in  independent  works,  presented  methods  of  calculating  the  exchange 
misalignment taking into account the tradable and non-tradable sectors of the economies. These authors explain that in richer 
countries the productivity rate of growth in the industrial sector is higher than in the services sector. With the labor market 
defining the average level of wage equilibrium among sectors, the price of services tends to be higher (and thus mean wages). 
Thus, the aggregate price level taking into account these two sectors tends to be higher in the more developed countries, which 
causes the real exchange rate tend to be overvalued in PPP terms (the reverse is true in developing countries , i.e. lower levels 
of productivity lead exchange rates to be more depreciated, since relative prices are lower). Thus, the real exchange rate (RER) 
not adjusted for these differences between the sectors, do not present themselves as valid to measure appreciation/depreciation 
of real exchange rates. However, when RER is adjusted for the differences between the average level of productivity between 
sectors, Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964) explain that it is possible to make appropriate comparisons. In this context, it is 
assumed here that the calculation of the real exchange rate of Rodrik (2008) is a good proxy for the behavior of this variable.

The variable misxrate is calculated from 3 steps. First it is used the nominal exchange rates from the

Defined this way, the variable 𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑡 is comparable between the panels of countries over time.

variable is centered at zero. 
 
To  ensure  the  robustness  of  the  empirical  estimations  in  section  4,  a  set  of  different  control 
variables is used13. They are divided between structural and macroeconomic variables. In the latter case it 
is taken into consideration the inflation rate (infla), which is a proxy for economic stability, and monetary 
policy, gross fixed capital formation (ainv), a proxy for the aggregate investment in the economy, and the 
government consumption share (govexp). It is expected a negative sign for infla and a positive sign for the 
variable ainv. Regarding the govexp is expected a negative sign suggesting that countries with a higher 
share of government in the final consumption have lower per capita growth rates.  
 
Regarding  the  structural  variables  are  taking  into  consideration  the  human  capital  through  the 
humank  variable.  This  variable  must  be  observed  of  an  evolutionary  perspective,  i.e.,  as  a  proxy  for 
learning ability in a broad sense, including technology. In other words, it is a proxy for human capital at 
the  macroeconomic  level.  It  is  expected  a  positive  sign,  indicating  that  the  higher  learning  ability,  the 
greater the impact on the explained variable (income per capita growth rate). The variable pop captures 
the effects of the population growth rate on the explanatory variable. In this case, it is expected a negative 
sign.  Finally  the  ttrade  variable,  which  represents  the  international  terms  of  trade  for  the  sample  of 
countries. A worsening  of the terms of trade will tend to undervalue RER, which can boost economic 
growth. 

produced  goods  are  relatively  cheaper  in  terms  of  dollar,  that  is,  the  exchange  rate  is  undervalued.

12 Rodrik (2008) found a  𝛽̂ of  -0.24 (t = -20), with a p-value of 0.00 for a panel of 188 countries within 1950-2004. However, 

he  used  averages  of  5  years  for  its  data,  conforming  subperiods  of  11  years.  The  small  difference  between  these  statistics 
suggests some constancy of the Balassa Samuelson effect over time. Correction for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation was 
performed using the generalized least squares method (GLS).   
13  In this case we are following Gala (2006). A comprehensive analysis for potential control variables for the economic growth 
literature can be seen in Bhalla (2012).

4.  MANUFACTURING  INDUSTRIES  AND  ECONOMIC  GROWTH:  A  DYNAMIC  PANEL 
ANALYSIS (GMM)  
 
 
In table 2 is presented the results of panel data model (1) considering different technological gap 
levels (gaptec) and the service sector (sixth and seventh columns). For the sample used in this estimates 
the gaptec has an average of 40.28 and a standard deviation of 1.42. It was considered in this econometric 
exercise that countries at the technological frontier have technological gap less than 1.5 (In Appendix 1 is

presented  the  sample  of  countries  within  this  criteria).  The  between  standard  deviation,  i.e.,  between 
countries, was 57.72, with a minimum of 0.68 and a maximum of 311.78. 
 
Based on the classification criteria of the sample that are not on the technological frontier in relation 
to  the  magnitude  of  the  technological  gap  standard  deviations  (between),  it  is  reported  in  Table  2  the 
estimates  for  the  dynamic  panel  specified  in  (1)  for  the  sample  of  84  countries  to  until  one  between 
standard  deviation  (“intermediate”  technological  gap),  in  the  range  of  two  to  one  between  standard 
deviations (“high” technology gap) and above two between standard deviations (“very high” technology 
gap).  Furthermore,  it  was  estimated  in  the  second  column  a  dynamic  panel  for  the  broad  sample  (see 
Appendix 1 for the country samples by technological gap). 
 
It can be observed in the Table 2 that the effect of real undervalued RER is positive and statistically 
significant with a lag for all the technological gap levels considered, increasing their effect on the per 
capita income growth rate when the technological gap measure is higher (for each group of countries). In 
other words, the greater effect of undervalued RER on the per capita growth rate is conditional on the 
technological  gap  level  considered:  the  farther  the  sample  of  countries  is  related  to  the  technological 
frontier, the greater the effect of the undervalued RER on per capita income growth rate. This positive and 
statistically significant result also was found in the broad sample for developing countries with all sectors 
considered (sixth column) and with the addition of the eci in the estimation (seventh column). This last 
variable was not statistically significant.  
The  variable  misxrate  was  not  significant  statistically  without  lag  in  the  panel  of  countries  with 
 
“high” and “very high” technological gap while was found negative and significant for the broad  samples 
(second  and  seventh  column)  and  to  “intermediate”  technological  gap  sample  of  countries.  This  result 
suggests  that  the  effect  of  misxrate  variable  affects  only  the  per  capita  income  growth  rate  in  a  non-
contemporary way when considering the economic activities (such as in the specification model in this 
work).  
 
 The variable related to the manufacturing share to GDP was positive and significant for all levels 
of  technological  gap  considered  as  well  as  in  the  broad  samples  (second,  sixth  and  seventh  columns). 
Furthermore, it did not present significant differences in magnitude to the different levels of technological 
gap. This result suggests that regardless of the technological gap distance of each sample of countries, 
manufacturing has a positive and significant effect on the per capita income growth rate.  
 
The  primary  sector  share  to  GDP  influences  negatively  the  per  capita  income  growth  rate  in  all 
technological gap levels considered, but with statistical significance only in the case of “high” and “very 
high” technological gap as well as in the broad samples (sixth and seventh columns). This result implies 
that even for the sample  of countries considered less developed and with higher technological gap the 
primary sector to GDP does not influence positively the per capita income growth rate.

Except for the “intermediate” technological gap sample of countries, for all other estimations the 
technological gap variable has a negative and statistically significantly effect on the per capita income 
growth rate. Thus, the greater the distance of the relative technological frontier, the lower tends to be the 
per capita income growth rate.  
The humank control variable only got the expected sign to the sample of countries with “very high” 
 
technological gap, but it was not statistically significant. Likewise, the infla control variable was negative 
only  in  this  technological  gap  level.  However,  it  was  statistically  significant  just  in  the  sample  of 
countries with “very high” technological gap. In relation to ainv control variable, it can be seen that it has 
the  expected  sign  for  all  samples,  but  it  was  just  statistically  significant  only  in  the  broad  samples 
(second, sixth and seventh columns) and in the “intermediate” technological gap sample. 
The govexp control variable obtained the expected sign and was statistically significant in the broad 
 
sample  estimations  (second  and  seventh  columns),  in  the  “intermediate”  and  “high”  technological  gap 
sample. However, it did not get the expected sign in the group of countries with “high” technological gap.  
For ttrade variable, it can be seen that it has a positive sign and is statistically significant only in the 
 
case  of  “high”  technological  gap.  Besides,  it  is  negative  and  statistically  significant  only  in  the  broad 
samples (sixth and seventh columns). The pop variable was negative and statistically significant for the 
countries of “intermediate” technological gap sample of countries and the broad samples (second, sixth

and seventh columns), but it was not significant statistically for the sample of countries with “very high” 
technological gap and had a positive sign in the case of the “high” technological gap sample of countries.  
 
The main hypothesis concerning the negative result about the primary and service sectors in this 
econometric  exercise  is  because  for  these  sample  of  countries  (underdeveloped)  the  majority  of  the 
activities within these sectors presents lower productivity, value added per worker and/or lower skilled 
labor.15  
 
The above results support the “engine of growth” hypothesis concerning manufacturing industries 
presented in section 2 for the sample of countries of this work for the period between 1990 and 2011. 
Besides, it was expected a positive sign for the primary sector parameter at least for higher technological 
gaps. However, this was not verified.  
 
In  all  estimations  reported  in  Table  2  it  is  not  rejected  the  null  hypothesis  that  overidentified 
restrictions are valid at the 1% level of significance16. Similarly, it does not reject the null hypothesis that 
there is no autocorrelation for higher order than AR (2).17 Furthermore, with the two step estimations it 
was  obtained  efficient  and  robust  parameters  for  any  standard  of  heterocedasticity,  whereas  for  the 
Windmeijer  (2005)´s  standard  errors  it  was  avoided  the  downward  bias  for  the  standard  errors  in  the 
estimators. 
 
5. TESTING FOR GRANGER NON-CAUSALITY IN HETEROGENEOUS PANELS 
 
 
In  this  section  it  is  applied  the  Granger  non-causality  test  for  heterogeneous  panels  with  fixed 
coefficients recently proposed by Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012).18  By doing it, it will be possible to test 
the  interrelationships  among  the  per  capita  income  growth  rate,  technological  gap,  manufacturing  and 
economic  complexity.  As  we  have  seen  in  the  previous  section,  the  manufacturing  industry  is  more 
important than the primary sector and services to the per capita income growth rate, even when taking 
into  account  different 
the 
influences/interrelationships (Granger causalities) among these variables. In addition, a relevant question 
to  these  tests  is  whether  the  productive  sophistication  (measure  by  eci)  and  smaller  technological  gap 
(gaptec)  are  the  causes  of  higher  per  capita  income  growth  rate  or  if  they  are  first  the  results  of  the 
positive effects of manufacturing on the sample of economies. 
 
 According  to  Granger  (1969)  the  concept  of  causality  is  the  capacity  of  a  variable  to  assist  in 
predicting the behavior of another variable of interest. Therefore, it is the existence of an intertemporal 
precedence in the explanation of a given variable. 
 
The  Granger  causality  test  (1969)  extension  to  panel  data  is  a  fairly  recent  methodological 
approach. The Holtz-Eakin, Newey and Rose (1988) and Kónya (2006) methodologies are examples of 
other possible approaches.  
 
More recently two other approaches have been used for the analysis of causal analysis in panel data 
and have gained prominence in the empirical literature. In the Kar Nazlioglu and Agir (2011)´s approach

15 For further analyses of these features in underdeveloped countries within these sectors see Su and Yao (2016), Rodrik (2008, 
2009 and 2016) and Marconi (2015).  
16 Whenever there is heteroskedasticity the Sargan (1958) test of overidentifying constraints usually rejects the null hypothesis 
(which is that they are valid). This means that there may be the presence of heteroscedasticity, poor model specification or 
even  inadequate  use  of  the  number  of  instruments,  cf.  Roodman  (2009).  In  addition  to  the  Sargan  test  (1958)  there  is  the 
Hansen test (1982). The two tests have good asymptotic properties in the absence of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation, as 
in the case of the panels estimated in Table 2. However, if the residues present any of these uncorrected problems, the Hansen 
test (1982) presents superior statistical properties, having only the problem of loss of power when the number of instruments 
used is high.  
17 According to Cameron and Trivedi (2010), if the residuals of the estimated models are not autocorrelated, they are expected 
to be in AR (1) but not in higher order, i.e., AR (n>1). If this condition is verified, as in the case of the estimates in Table 2, the 
null hypothesis of no serial autocorrelation of the residuals is not rejected.   
18 The idea of this test was first exposed by Hurlin (2005) at the LIIIe Annual Congress of the French Economic Association.  
However, in Hurlin (2005) it can only be observed a general outline of the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) test, where cross-
dependency  issues  are  not  worked  out,  as  is  the  case  for  unbalanced  panels.  In  Hurlin  (2005)  the  asymptotic  and  semi-
asymptotic theory of the test is not formally developed, which is done in Dumistresco and Hurlin (2012) from Monte Carlo 
simulations.

In the context of the application of the Dumistrescu and Hurlin (2012)´s Granger causality test, the 

The null hypothesis states that the analyzed causal relationship does not exist for any individual unit 

is estimated an error correction vector by GMM . However, this method does not control for the potential 
cross section dependence between the panels, which is made in Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012). 19 
 
The  Dumitrescu  and  Hurlin  (2012)´s  approach  generates  more  efficient  estimators  even  in  small 
samples  multivariate  models.  It  can  be  applied  to  unbalanced  panels  allowing  different  lags  order  for 
different cross section units, and thus this approach is more robust than others. Considering two stationary 
variables x and y the null and alternative are the following:

causal relationship (i.e. 𝑁1+1,𝑁1+2,…,𝑁).  Given this methodological construction of Dumistrescu

Similarly to what is observed in the research on time series econometric, the presence of unit roots 
in panel data can lead to spurious econometric relations in the Granger causality tests. In this work it is 
used the Im Pesaran and Shin (1997) test and the ADF Fisher and PP Fisher tests versions proposed by 
Maddala and Wu (1999) and Choi (2001). 
As it can be seen in Table 3 only gaptec is not stationary at 1% significance level. This variable is I 
 
(1) integrated, so that it was verified as stationary after the transformation process of the series (at 1% 
significance) in the three methods employed in order to be used in the Granger causality tests as dgaptec.

dependence in panel, the results of the test are robust.

by the Hanna Quinn criteria information.  
In the Tables 6 and 7 are reported the calculations of the Wald statistics, the Zbar20 statistics and the 
 
associated p-value for the samples, 47 countries (Table 4 - sample of developing or emerging countries) 
and  17  countries  (Table  5  –  Sample  of  developed  countries)  –  See  Appendix  2  for  the  samples  of 
countries.  
 
In Table 4 it can be seen that there is a unidirectional causal relationship of the technological gap in 
relation to the level of economic complexity, per capita income growth rate and the manufacturing share 
to GDP. Similarly, there is a significant and unidirectional relationship of the economic complexity level 
towards  misxrate  and  a  bidirectional  relationship  between  the  manufacturing  share  to  GDP  and  the 
economic complexity level. 
As Table 4 presents there is a bidirectional or simultaneity of the real exchange rate (misxrate) and 
 
the manufacturing share to GDP and a unidirectional relation between misxrate to the per capita growth 
rate.  
 
It can be observed a statistically significant bidirectional relationship or simultaneity between the 
manufacturing  share  to  GDP  and  per  capita  income  growth  rates.  Similarly,  there  is  a  bidirectional 
relationship or simultaneity between the manufacturing share to GDP and the economic complexity level. 
 
Thus,  these  results  partially  confirm  positively  the  question  addressed  in  the  beginning  of  this 
section:  manufacturing  industries  Granger  causes  the  economic  complexity  level  (eci)  and  the 
technological  gap  (gaptec)  for  developing  economies.  Notwithstanding,  there  is  a  bidirectional 
relationship or simultaneity between them and it was found that the technological gap also Granger cause 
per capita income growth rate but not economic complexity.  
 
These  results  imply  that  the  premature  decrease  of  the  manufacturing  share  to  GDP  in  the 
developing economies can reduce the level of productive sophistication (measure by eci), hindering the 
catching  up  process  and  the  achievement  of  higher  per  capita  income  levels  (falling  behind  situation). 
Moreover, the productive sophistication and smaller technological gap affect in a bidirectional way the 
manufacturing share to GDP and in turn, this sector share affects also in a bidirectional way the per capita 
income  growth  rate. Therefore, these results suggest that the productive  sophistication captured  by  eci 
affects the per capita income growth rate through manufacturing industries.

In the diagram 1 it is schematically presented the Granger causality relations results for developing 
 
countries  (Table  4).  It  can  be  seen  that  the  relationship  between  per  capita  income  growth  rate  and 
productive structure has in the manufacturing an important mechanism for catching up (i.e. reducing the 
technological gap) as well as for income convergence.

Finally,  it  can  be  seen  a  statistically  significant  precedence  in  relation  to  economic  complexity 

 
 
The  main  similar  statistical  relationship  to  that  found  in  developing  countries  is  related  to 
bidirectional or simultaneity concerning the manufacturing share to GDP in relation to per capita income 
growth rates and the fact that the manufacturing share to GDP temporally precedes the real exchange rate 
level. This result suggests that even in developed countries the manufacturing industry plays an important 
role in terms of per capita income growth rate. 
 
It was not verified any causal relationship between manufacturing share to GDP and the economic 
complexity. Otherwise, the assumption behind this result is that the level of economic complexity in the 
developed countries sample has come, at least for the most part, from the services sector. 
 
towards the real exchange rate indicator, but not vice versa. 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
 
The main objective of this paper was to investigate empirically the joint effects of manufacturing 
and real exchange rate (RER) on the real per capita income growth rate as well as economic complexity 
for a diversified sample of countries. 
 
According to the Kaldorian approach the increasing returns of scale in the manufacturing industries 
and  its  technological  spillovers  to  the  rest  of  the  economy  are  the  driving  forces  behind  the  positive 
effects of this sector on the labor productivity dynamics and economic growth. In this sense, the empirical 
analysis  carried  out  in  this  article  provided  robust  results  that  place  the  manufacturing  industries 
positively influencing the level of economic complexity (proxy for productive sophistication), the income 
per capita growth rate and negatively influencing the level of technological gap. In other words, we have 
found results that corroborate the role of “engine of growth” in this sector and its important role for the 
process of catching up in the developing countries for the period from 1990 to 2011. 

 

 

 

16 

 
Even  when  considered  the  non-tradable  sector  in  terms  of  its  value  added  share,  the  estimations 
presented that manufacturing industries still plays a positive and statistically significant role concerning 
the per capita income growth rate.  
 
The premature decrease of the manufacturing share to GDP in the developing economies can reduce 
the level of productive sophistication, hindering the catching up process and the achievement of higher 
per capita income levels (falling behind situation).  
 
Another  important  empirical  evidence  concerns  the  effect  of  the  undervalued  real  exchange  rate 
(RER)  on  the  income  per  capita  rate  of  growth.  The  positive  effect  of  the  former  to  the  latter  was 
conditional  on  the  technological  gap  level  considered  and  it  was  lagged.  The  farther  the  sample  of 
countries considered was in relation to the technological frontier, the greater the effect of the undervalued 
RER in the income per capita growth rate. Theses results means that countries below the technological 
frontier and therefore at a great disadvantage from the point of view of non-price competitiveness need to 
compensate this backwardness with some competitive price advantage, which is represented here by an 
undervalued real exchange rate (RER). 
 
With the reallocation of resources to non-industrial sectors, such as activities linked to commodity 
production (in the primary sector), where there are decreasing returns to scale, the real overvaluation of 
the RER reduces the total productivity of the economy and the structural change is towards to lower value 
added    goods.  Therefore,  a  structural  change  that  negatively  affects  manufacturing  in  developing 
economies, in particular, reduces the level of technological development and diversity of tradable goods 
production,  negatively  affecting  the  level  of  productive  sophistication  (i.e.  the  level  of  economic 
complexity). 
 
Finally,  the  found  results  indicates  that  the  real  exchange  rate  is  an  important  economic  policy 
variable to income per capita growth rate and the higher level of economic complexity as well as to the 
decrease of the technological gap, since it affects manufacturing in the developing countries.
