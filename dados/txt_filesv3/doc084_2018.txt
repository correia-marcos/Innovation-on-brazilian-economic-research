Abstract

This paper analyzes the evolution of income elasticities of imports and veriﬁes the validity of
Thirlwall’s Law for eight Latin American countries over the period 1970-2015. Given the econo-
metric issues inherent to classical time-varying parameter regressions, a Bayesian estimation
procedure is implemented in order to provide more robust parameter estimates. A stochastic
volatility speciﬁcation is also included to take into account the potential presence of conditional
heteroskedasticity. While some Latin American economies showed a rather stable behavior, the
income elasticities of imports for Brazil, Colombia and Mexico presented an upward trend from
1970 to 2015. Regarding the validity of Thirlwall’s Law, there were evidences of the balance-of-
payments (BOP) posing a restriction to the growth performance in six of the eight selected Latin
American countries. Estimates for the theoretical rate of economic growth with BOP equilibrium
supported the idea of an overall catching-up trajectory for Latin America in the period.

Resumo

O objetivo do presente estudo é analisar a evolução das elasticidades-renda das importações e
veriﬁcar a validade da lei de Thirlwall para oito países da América Latina durante o período
de 1970-2015. Dada as questões econométricas inerentes às regressões com parâmetros tempo-
variante, utiliza-se métodos bayesianos a ﬁm de fornecer estimativas mais robustas. A ﬁm de
levar em consideração a presença de heterocedasticidade condicional, é incluída a especiﬁcação
com volatilidade estocástica no modelo. Enquanto algumas economias da América Latina ap-
resentaram um comportamento estável em relação às elasticidades-renda das importações no
período estudado, o Brasil, Colômbia e México mostraram uma tendência crescente. Em relação
à validade da lei de Thirwall, há evidências de que o balanço de pagamentos (BOP) coloca uma
restrição à performance de crescimento em seis das oito economias selecionadas. As estimativas
teóricas da taxa de crescimento com equilíbrio no balanço de pagamentos corrobora a ideia uma
trajetória geral de convergência para a América Latina no período.

1 Introduction
Latin America has been the stage of both prosperity and recession periods. From its economic collapse in the
1980s and, consequently, the later commitment to Neoliberal macroeconomic reforms, the extensive historical
disequilibria in the balance-of-payments (BOP) faced by many developing countries have reinforced the need
of evaluating the argument of whether international trade is de facto a constraint to economic performance.
Since the seminal paper by Thirlwall (1979), which introduced the BOP-constrained growth framework,
there has been a vast debate on its potential empirical applicability to economies throughout the world.
While growth models of Neoclassical tradition rely on supply side issues such as factor accumulation, pro-
ductivity increments or technological progress as driving forces of economic growth (Solow, 1956, 1957;
Swan, 1956; Romer, 1986; Lucas, 1988; Mankiw et al., 1992; Aghion and Howitt, 1992), the former Post
Keynesian approach postulates that output growth is demand-determined, with foreign exchange dynamics
being crucial on explaining its sustainability. By embodying the assumption of trade deﬁcits not being auto-
matically corrected via adjustment of the real exchange rate, the presence of continuously increasing current
account deﬁcits would then hamper the growth of domestic output given the lack of also ever-growing ﬁ-
nancing sources. Hence, the insuﬃciency of foreign currency from trade imbalances would then set an upper
limit to the growth rate of aggregate demand and, thus, to economic growth (Thirlwall and Hussain, 1982;
McCombie, 1997).

Moreover, one should notice that the BOP-constrained growth approach has been steadily criticized by
disregarding the biases and inconsistent parameter estimates due to structural breaks. Since the study of
Bairam (1993), cointegration analysis has been the predominant econometric method adopted by the recent
literature to evaluate the potential long-run relationship between economic growth and the BOP dynamics.
However, given that this latter procedure requires a large sample size and that macroeconomic relations are
likely to change over time, structural break problems have compromised the reliability of cointegration-based
evidences (Bagnai, 2010).

Despite some recent attempts on dealing with these issues (Hieke, 1997; Atesoglu, 1997; Bairam and
Ng, 2001; Bértola et al., 2002; Holland et al., 2004; Pacheco-López and Thirlwall, 2006; Cimoli et al., 2010;
Bagnai, 2010), the Post Keynesian empirical literature has yet to tackle parametric instability considering
the whole sample period. According to McCombie (1997), the parameters associated to trade equations
should evolve slowly over time. In general, classical recursive and rolling regression methods often incur
statistical issues such as ad hoc window selection, loss of inference eﬃcacy (mainly due to degrees of freedom
restrictions) and biased parameter estimates. Therefore, the application of nonlinear Bayesian estimation
methods is an appealing alternative. By amending the univariate regression framework to allow for param-
eters following a ﬁrst-order random walk process, it is possible to capture smooth parametric shifts, thus
being a more suitable procedure for describing time-varying economic dynamics.

This paper focuses on the evolution of income elasticities of imports in Latin America between 1970 and
2015 and veriﬁes whether the BOP was indeed a constraint to the region’s economic growth. To this end, we
ﬁrst estimate time-varying parameter (TVP) univariate regressions with stochastic volatility for the Latin
economies’ import functions, following closely the methodology procedure proposed by Nakajima (2011).
The time-varying parameter speciﬁcation provides time-varying income elasticity of imports estimates while
the stochastic volatility takes into account the potential conditional heteroskedasticity that might arise from
potential stochastic shocks over the volatility of the considered macroeconomic aggregates (Hamilton, 2010).
Based on these elasticity estimates, we then check the validity of Thirlwall’s Law for the region.

As to the contribution to the debate, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst application of
a Bayesian approach to deal with potential parametric instability while estimating the income elasticities
of imports in Latin America. This would allow for more robust estimates and a better description of these
elasticities’ movements over time. In fact, the results show that the volatility of imports has, in general,
decreased from 1970 to 2015 in Latin America. Also, from the estimates for the time-varying income
elasticities of imports, it is possible to divide the Latin American economies into two diﬀerent groups, with
the ﬁrst one presenting a rather stable behavior over time, while the second one showed a clear upward
trend. This increase is a repercussion of the region’s commitment to Neoliberal trade reforms. Regarding
the validity of Thirlwall’s Law, the results were inconclusive only for Colombia and Peru. Last, but not
least, the BOP-constrained growth rates for the selected Latin American economies provided evidence of a
catching-up trajectory relative to the world economy. However, when considering the period 2000-2015, the

2

results showed that only Bolivia and Brazil sustained such trajectory.

Besides this introduction and the concluding remarks, the paper is organized in four sections. First,
Section 2 focuses on a historical overview of the trade developments in Latin America. Section 3 introduces
the Post Keynesian theory of BOP-constrained growth. Section 4 describes the model structure and the
estimation procedure of the TVP regression framework. Last, but not least, Section 5 presents the estimates
for the time-varying income elasticities of imports, discussing their repercussions for the validity of Thirlwall’s
Law in its seminal version and whether the selected economies were on a catching-up or falling behind
trajectory in the period.

2 Trade Developments and Economic Growth in Latin America
From the 1950s, the development strategy in Latin America, mainly based on the adoption of import
substitution policies, was responsible for reducing the openness and eﬃciency of the regional economies,
increasing their external vulnerability, due to higher dependency on a narrow range of export products,
and consequently hampering their ability to absorb external shocks (Rajagopal, 2005). Following the onset
of the the oil crises in the 1970s, which considerably aﬀected the developing economies that relied on the
product, the external indebtedness faced in the 1980s produced large disparities of GDP per capita (Bleaney,
1999). In particular, the subsequent emergence of trade imbalances was a crucial element in deepening the
economic growth slowdown and in the later commitment to Neoliberal trade reforms.

Recently, empirical research has provided evidences of a direct correlation between the Latin America’s
external vulnerability and its rather volatile economic growth (Garret and Lange, 1986; Guillaumont, 2001;
Cordina, 2004; Loayza and Raddatz, 2007; Briguglio et al., 2008; Seth and Ragab, 2012). Indeed, as shown
in Table 1, the period 1974-1986 presented a pronounced degree of GDP growth volatility in comparison to
the period 1986-2007. In addition, the increase on the coeﬃcient of variation in the last decade could be
explained by the adverse eﬀects of the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. Hence, these results suggest that the stability of
Latin American growth rates has been intrinsically related to external ﬁnancing ﬂuctuations and commodity
price cycles.

Despite the existence of distinct patterns, the overall Latin American trade volume has presented an
upward trend since the mid 1970s, with an average growth rate of nearly 4.8% per year (Table 1). More
speciﬁcally, the percentage of trade growth in the Latin American economies slightly increased from an
average of 5% during 1974-1986 to an average rate of 5.6% during 1986-2007. On the other hand, the
coeﬃcient of variation declined sharply, posting a contraction of 2.28 points (from 2.88 to 0.60). Yet, in
regard to the last decade, Latin American trade grew at a slower pace. With less than half the average
rate observed historically – roughly 2% per year –, the growth of trade followed the economic downturn
in the aftermath of recent global crisis. According to the International Monetary Fund (2016), the recent
slowdown in global economic activity, mostly in investment, is responsible for up to three-fourths of the trade
deceleration. Furthermore, the end of the 1986-2007 boom also exposed many primary-exporting countries
in the region to sizable terms of trade shocks, with the correction in commodity prices resulting in an acute
decrease in the value of Latin America’s trade.

In terms of development strategy, the shift from the import substitution paradigm toward the adoption

3

of the export-led growth framework in the late 1970s placed trade integration as the cornerstone of the
Latin American industrialization process. Trade had become the catalyst of economic growth. The struc-
tural adjustment under the neoclassical prescription essentially relied on liberalization reforms, ﬁnancial
deregulation and dismantling of state intervention. While Latin America beneﬁted from increased trade
openness in the mid 1980s and early 1990s, its level remained rather stable thereafter. For instance, the
region’s degree of openness increased from 21% in 1983 to 45% in 2007 (Figure 1). This result suggests that
trade reforms implemented in Latin America broadened the integration of the region in the international
market. Also, from visual inspection of Figure 1, one can conclude that the degree of openness seems to have
mirrored the behavior of Latin America’s GDP, particularly after the early 1980s. However, in comparison
to other emerging and developed economies, the relatively low average trade integration in Latin America
could be partially explained by unrelated trade factors, such as geography, high transport costs and the
weak quality of institutions (De Ferranti et al., 2003).

Figure 1: Degree of Openness and GDP – Latin America (1970-2015)

Notes: The Degree of Openness corresponds to the ratio of exports plus imports to GDP. The Latin America imports and
exports of goods and services as well as GDP are at constant 2010 prices, in USD. Data series were extracted from the WDI
database (World Bank, 2017). Degree of Openness (dashed line) and GDP (solid line).

Even though several theoretical and empirical studies have propelled the positive impacts of openness
on economic performance (Dollar, 1992; Ben-David, 1993; Krugman, 1994; Sachs et al., 1995; Edwards,
1998; Frankel and Romer, 1999; Lucas, 2009; Kim et al., 2012), the debate has yet to be settled. From
a structural Keynesian viewpoint, the export-led development would be ineﬀective in generating stable
economic linkages and promoting genuine prosperity (Palley, 2002, 2004). Moreover, the restructuring of
the productive system toward an export-oriented industrialization would be more subject to adverse external
shocks in contrast to development strategies reliant on domestic demand (Foxley, 2009). Therefore, despite
the upward path of Latin America’s trade performance engendered by its fairly commitment to the export-
led growth paradigm, the resulting increase in its external vulnerability poses an additional predicament
to the region. Consequently, in light of this pronounced sensitivity to international conditions, the recent
end of the high commodity prices cycle pari passu the Chinese economic slowdown are likely to restrain
even further its already stagnant economic performance. Ergo, as discussed by Ocampo (2013), rethinking
Latin America’s development patterns and strategies is of major importance in order to promote social and
economic welfare.

3 The Balance-of-Payments-Constrained Growth Model Revisited
Unless a country can ﬁnance ever-growing current account deﬁcits, the economic performance of a given
economy cannot grow faster than the rate consistent with BOP equilibrium (Thirlwall, 1979). In the presence
of recurrent trade imbalances and the relative scarcity of ﬁnancing sources, the resulting insuﬃciency of
foreign currency would then set an upper limit to the growth rate of aggregate demand and, thus, to
economic growth.

where a and b are constants; Z is world income; Y is domestic income; δ (< 0) is the price elasticity of

is the income elasticity of imports. Note that this seminal model structure formalized by Thirlwall (1979)
speciﬁed elasticities as constant quantities over time.

After transforming equations 1 to 3 into their respective growth rates and solving the subsequent system
of linear equations for the domestic income growth rate (y), it is possible to deﬁne the economic growth
compatible with BOP equilibrium (yB), that is,

yB = (1 + δ + ψ)(pd − pf − e) + λz

π

with lower-case letters corresponding to the growth rates of the variables. The time subscripts were dropped
for notational convenience. From the relation depicted by equation 4, an improvement in the real terms of
trade, ceteris paribus, would increase the growth compatible with BOP equilibrium if the sum of the price
elasticities of exports and imports is less than −1. Yet, in the presence of the Marshall-Lerner condition,
δ+ψ > −1, the deterioration in competitiveness due to an improvement in the real terms of trade would then
decrease the growth compatible with BOP equilibrium. Also, only persistent depreciations of the exchange
rate (i.e. e > 0) would lead to a permanently higher growth trajectory for a given country. Last, but not
least, there exists an inverse relation between the income elasticity of imports and the growth compatible
with BOP equilibrium.
Following McCombie and Thirwall (1994), if relative prices in international trade are neutral in the
long-run (i.e. pd − pf − e = 0), thus not presenting signiﬁcant eﬀects on the growth compatible with BOP
equilibrium path of a given country, and if capital ﬂows cannot ﬁnance current account deﬁcits, equation 4
reduces to

This last equation has come to be known as Thirlwall’s Law. However, as discussed by Thirlwall (2011)
himself, this relationship and its implications were built on the previous theoretical macroeconomic devel-
opments of Harrod’s foreign trade multiplier (Harrod, 1933), Hicks’ super-multiplier (Hicks, 1950) and the
Prebisch-Singer hypothesis (Prebisch, 1959, 1962; Singer, 1950).

Several empirical studies have been conducted in order to validate the applicability of Thirlwall’s Law for
both developed and emerging economies (Thirlwall and Hussain, 1982; Bairam, 1988; Atesoglu, 1993, 1997;
McCombie, 1997; Hieke, 1997; Alonso, 1999; Moreno-Brid, 1998, 1999; Bértola et al., 2002; Razmi, 2005;
Kvedaras, 2005; Garcimartín et al., 2008; Britto and McCombie, 2009; Felipe et al., 2010; Bagnai, 2010). In
general, the obtained results have conﬁrmed the validity of the BOP-constrained growth framework.

For the speciﬁc case of Latin America, López and Cruz (2000) incorporated the real exchange rate in
the model in order to analyze its eﬀect on the long-term economic growth of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia

5

and Mexico. Their results supported the idea that, in the presence of the Marshall-Lerner condition, faster
rate of output growth could be achieved by adopting competitive exchange rate levels.

Additionally, with a sample of ten Latin American economies, Holland et al. (2004) tested the adherence
of the predicted growth rate compatible with BOP equilibrium to the actual long-term growth rates. Despite
the presence of some deviation, the results corroborated the argument of the BOP posing a restriction to
the region’s long-term economic growth.

Pacheco-López and Thirlwall (2006) investigated whether the adoption of trade liberalization by the
Latin American economies had increased their income elasticity of imports. The authors implemented
rolling regression models in order to capture a potential upward trend over time. Besides proving the
validity of Thirlwall’s Law, their results also conﬁrmed this trend for the country sample.

Similarly, using rolling regressions with panel data for a broad sample of developed and emerging
economies, Cimoli et al. (2010) also showed that the Latin American income elasticities of imports have
increased since 1970. Along with those results, the authors provided further evidences that the decrease in
the income gap of some developing countries was intrinsically related to the transformation of their economic
structures.

Moreover, based on a multi-sectoral perspective, Gouvea and Lima (2010) evaluated the implications
of changes in the sectoral composition of exports and imports on the external constraint for a sample of
Latin American and Asian countries. Both the original and the multisectoral versions of Thirlwall’s law
were validated for Latin America.

A basic TVP regression model can be deﬁned as

with t ∼ N(0, σ2
vectors of covariates, respectively; β is a (k × 1) vector of time-invariant coeﬃcients; and αt is a (p × 1)
vector of time-varying coeﬃcients. In this paper, the regression model is assumed to have only time-varying
coeﬃcients (i.e. x

As to the evolution process of αt, the parameters are assumed to follow a driftless ﬁrst-order random

walk speciﬁcation, given by

αt+1 = αt + ut

(7)
with ut ∼ N(0, Σ) and t = 1, . . . , n − 1. We assume that α0 = 0 and u0 ∼ N(0, Σ0). This speciﬁcation, in
contrast to Markov-switching models, allows for both temporary and permanent shifts instead of discrete
breaks, thus being a more suitable characterization of potential changes in private sector behavior or the
learning dynamics of economic agents. More speciﬁcally, the time-varying coeﬃcient is imposed as to capture
a possible nonlinearity, such as a gradual change or a structural break (Primiceri, 2005; Nakajima, 2011).
The stochastic volatility speciﬁcation is included by imposing a log-volatility process for the time-varying

variance σ2

t , that is,

σ2
t = γ exp(ht)

(8)
with ht+1 = φht + ηt; ηt ∼ N(0, σ2
η); and t = 1, . . . , n−1. Note that ht is the stochastic volatility. Moreover,
we assume that γ > 0; |φ| < 0; h0 = 0; and the initial condition is set based on the stationary distribution
as η0 ∼ N(0, σ2

Consider αt and ht as state variables. Then, the TVP regression model consists of a nonlinear non-
Gaussian state space representation. Primiceri (2005) argues that the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation
cannot provide reliable estimates for this class of models due to intractability of the likelihood function.
Therefore, the estimation procedure is mainly based on a Bayesian approach using the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method for the numerical evaluation of the posterior of the parameters.

By splitting up the original problem into a number of smaller steps, the Bayesian inference is able to
deal with high-dimensional parameter space and potential nonlinearities in the likelihood function. Under
the assumption of a certain prior probability density, p(θ), the MCMC algorithm is able to generate the
joint posterior distribution of the parameters, p(θ|y), given by

θ p(θ)L(y|θ)dθ is the marginal distribution (also known as the
where y = {yt}n
normalizing constant); and L(y|θ) is the likelihood function. In other words, the Bayesian inference consists
of updating the prior information on θ by observing y. However, since the posterior distribution usually
does not have a closed form due to the intractability of the likelihood function and to the impossibility of
an analytical assessment for the marginal distribution, the MCMC sampling methods are fairly robust algo-
rithms capable of recursively sampling from the posterior distribution without computing them (Nakajima,
2011).

of a linear Gaussian state space model. As in Nakajima (2011), α is sampled simultaneously from the

by running the state equation along with the draw of (ηr−1, . . . , ηr+d−1) given hr−1.

In order to sample (ηr−1, . . . , ηr+d−1) from the density (15), Nakajima (2011) advocates in favor of
combining the classic accept-reject (AR) sampling1 and the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm2 with a
proposal distribution given by

1The objective of the accept-reject (AR) sampling, also known as the von Neumann sampling, is to sample from a target
density π(x) = f(x)/K, with f(x) being an unnormalized target density and K an unknown normalizing constant. However,
this target distribution might be impossible to simulate by an inverse transformation. Hence, suppose it is possible to sample
from the density h(x) and that there exists a constant c for which f(x) ≤ ch(x) for all x. In order to obtain a draw from π(x),
the AR sampling proceeds to draw a candidate z from h and u from the uniform distribution U(0, 1). If u ≤ f(z)/ch(z), z is
accepted. Otherwise, the process is repeated.

2Given the impossibility of direct sampling from the posterior distribution, the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm is a
MCMC method implemented in order to simulate samples by combining the use of the full joint density function and a proposal
distribution. This proposal distribution is usually chosen as to correspond as close as possible to the target conditional posterior
distribution. More speciﬁcally, deﬁne q(θ∗|θ(i)) as the probability density function of the proposal given the current point θ(i)
and α(θ0, θ∗) as the acceptance rate from the current point θ0 to the proposal θ∗, which is given by

p(θ∗|y)q(θ0|θ∗)
p(θ0|y)q(θ∗|θ0)

where p(θ|y) is the target posterior distribution and θ∗ is a candidate from the proposal q(θ∗|θ(i)). The MH algorithm consists
of choosing an arbitrary starting point θ(0) and setting i = 0. Then, it generates a candidate θ∗ and evaluates this candidate
according to the probability α(θ(i), θ∗). If θ∗ is accepted, it sets θ(i+1) = θ∗; otherwise, it sets θ(i+1) = θ(i). Finally, we set
i = i + 1 and repeat the process. According to Nakajima (2011), this iteration process produces the sample from the target
conditional posterior distribution.

Then, one must ﬁnd (ˆhr, . . . , ˆhr+d) as near as possible to the mode of the posterior density. This is
performed as to guarantee eﬃciency during the sampling process. For this, Nakajima (2011) proposes the

These steps are looped several times until (ˆht, . . . , ˆhr+d) reach near the mode of the posterior density.
In addition, one should note that E(ht|ω) is the product in the simulation smoother as Λtrt with εt = 0.
Following Nakajima (2011), (h1, . . . , hn) is divided into K + 1 blocks, that is, (hki−1+1, . . . , hki) for i =
1, . . . , K + 1 with k0 = 0 and kK+1 = n, then sampling each block recursively. The author also highlights
that the determination of (k1, . . . , kK) is done by implementing the stochastic knots method, which proposes
ki = int[n(i + Ui)/(K + 2)], for i = 1, . . . , K, with Ui being a random sample from the uniform distribution
U(0, 1). The (k1, . . . , kK) is randomly chosen for each iteration of the MCMC sampling in order to guarantee
a ﬂexible draw of (h1, . . . , hn).
• Sample φ
First, the prior distribution for φ is deﬁned as p(φ) and it is assumed that (φ + 1)/2 ∼
Beta(αφ0, βφ0) in order to satisfy the restriction |φ| < 1. Hence, the conditional posterior distribution of φ
is

5 Time-Varying Income Elasticity of Imports and Economic Growth in

Latin America

Following the import function deﬁned by Thirlwall (1979), the TVP regression model is applied in order
to obtain time-varying income elasticities of imports for eight Latin American countries3, namely, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. In 2015, these countries represented together
nearly 81% of Latin America GDP (at constant 2010 prices, in USD) (ECLAC, 2017). Hence, the time-
varying econometric model for each country is deﬁned as

mt = πt(yt) + ψt(reert) + t

(25)

where mt is the import growth rate; yt is the domestic output growth rate; reert is the real eﬀective exchange
rate (REER) growth rate; and t ∼ N(0, σ2
t ). This is a linear in growth rates model, whose parameters
are interpreted as elasticities4. As discussed in Section 4, the time-varying parameters πt and ψt follow a
driftless random walk process, that is, αt+1 = αt + ut, with αt ≡ (πt, ψt) and ut ∼ N(0, Σ). Also, the
time-varying variance σ2
t = γ exp(ht), where ht+1 = φht + ηt
and ηt ∼ N(0, σ2

t is deﬁned as a log-volatility process, so that σ2

η). Note that ht is the stochastic volatility.

Annual data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP), imports and exports of goods and services were obtained
from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database, maintained by the World Bank (2017). These data
were extracted at constant 2010 prices, in USD. As to the annual REER index, the data were collected from
the database developed by Darvas (2012), with its base changed to 2010. The growth rates were constructed
as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the period t and t − 1 values. The growth rate dataset spans from
1970 to 2015.

With respect to the choice of prior distributions, this paper follows closely the default values proposed

in Nakajima (2011):

β ∼ N(0, 10 × I), Σ ∼ IW(4, 40 × I), α1 ∼ N(0, 10 × I)
φ + 1
γ ∼ IG(2, 0.02)
2 ∼ Beta(20, 1.5),

η ∼ IG(2, 0.02),
σ2

These could be considered rather diﬀuse priors, which contribute to mitigate potential identiﬁcation issues.
Moreover, in order to compute the posterior estimates, the TVP regression model for each country is
estimated by drawing 100,000 samples after the initial 10,000 samples were discarded in the burn-in period.
Autocorrelation and convergence are common issues associated to MCMC sampling methods. However,
the estimation results showed that the sampling method eﬃciently produces uncorrelated samples, since
the sample paths looked stable and the sample autocorrelations dropped stably for all countries. Also, we
observed that the convergence diagnosis (CD) and the ineﬃciency factors (IF) of Geweke (1992) conﬁrmed
that, for the eight considered countries, the null hypothesis of convergence to the posterior distribution
3Regarding Argentina, due to the recent political manipulation of oﬃcial economic statistics by its government, the country

was excluded from the sample.

4In a study on measurement issues in estimating elasticity values, Casler (2015) found that the linear in growth rate re-
gression speciﬁcation provides more accurate estimates than the commonly used linear, logarithmic, logarithmic-linear and
linear-logarithmic speciﬁcations. Furthermore, the results obtained by the author also advocates in favor of the natural loga-
rithmic growth rate method in comparison to the standard base, the reverse base and the geometric-mean growth rate methods.

12

is not rejected for the parameters and state variables at the 10% signiﬁcance level and that the sampling
method is eﬃcient, since the IF values are rather low.5

Figure 2 plots the posterior estimates for the stochastic volatility of the Latin American countries. In
general, the volatility of imports has decreased from 1970 to 2015 for all eight countries. More speciﬁcally, the
estimates for Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay show that the variance of their imports decreased
after the mid 1980s, however slightly increasing after 2008. These evidences are in accordance with the
stabilization of international trade after the 1970s and early 1980s oil crises and the uncertainty engendered
by the recent ﬁnancial crisis, respectively. On the other hand, regarding Bolivia and Mexico, the instability
of their imports from the 1970s to the early 1980s is relatively higher than the other considered Latin
American economies. Yet, specially in Mexico, the stochastic volatility of imports has steadily decreased
after the mid 1980s. In the case of Colombia, the increase on the variance of imports in the 1990s is in line
with the Colombian trade liberalization policies enacted during the period.

As the variance of imports depicts a reasonably pronounced time-varying behavior from 1970 to 2015,
one should also expect time-variation on the estimates for the Latin American income elasticities of imports.
In fact, as shown in Figure 3, the estimates for all eight countries presented some degree of time-variation.
With exception of Chile, it is possible to combine the considered Latin American economies into two diﬀerent
groups based on the evolution pattern of their income elasticities of imports. The ﬁrst group, consisting of
Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay, showed rather stable estimates over time, with small changes in the
early 1980s and mid 1990s. As to the second group, consisting of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, there has
been an upward trend in their estimates. Following the tradition set out by Thirlwall (1979), these evidences
would suggest that the rate of economic growth compatible with the BOP equilibrium has decreased for
these countries. For instance, the recent studies by Pacheco-López and Thirlwall (2006) and Cimoli et al.
(2010) support these results, with the authors arguing that the increase in the income elasticities of imports
in Latin America is highly correlated to the region’s commitment to Neoliberal trade liberalization policies,
mainly in the form of tariﬀ reductions, import quotas and licenses. Finally, in the case of Chile, despite
its estimates being relatively volatile through the sample period, the country has recently shown income
elasticity of imports levels similar to those from the beginning of the sample.

Even though these evidences are in favor of the Post Keynesian theory of BOP-constrained growth, the
validity of the seminal model developed by Thirlwall (1979) has yet to be properly tested. Following the
strategy suggested by McCombie (1997), an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is implemented for
each country in order to statistically test whether the observed growth rate (y) and the theoretical rate of
economic growth with BOP equilibrium (y∗) are diﬀerent. If so, the result would then advocate against the
validity of Thirlwall’s Law. Note that y∗ is computed based on equation 5. Hence, the OLS speciﬁcation to
be tested for each country is

y∗
t = ρyt + t

(26)

where t is a white noise disturbance. The Thirlwall’s Law is validated if the parameter ρ is not statistically
diﬀerent from the unity.

Table 2 presents the estimation results. With the exception of Peru, the null hypothesis of ρ being equal
to zero is rejected by all countries at the 1% signiﬁcance level. On the other hand, apart from Colombia and
Peru, the null hypothesis of ρ being statistically equal to the unity is not rejected at the 10% signiﬁcance
level (note that, in the case of Mexico, the null hypothesis is not rejected at the 5% signiﬁcance level).
Hence, the obtained results conﬁrm the validity of Thirlwall’s Law for most of the country sample, which
implies that the BOP has indeed posed a restriction to their economic performance from 1970 to 2015.

One should note that the present approach to the BOP-constrained growth model has only considered
the seminal model of Thirlwall (1979). Therefore, these results should be considered as a preliminary
investigation for the selected Latin American economies. Yet, the novelty of these results is associated to
the use of a robust Bayesian econometric framework to estimate time-varying income elasticities of imports,
controlling for stochastic volatility.

Furthermore, given the long-term nature of the theoretical rates of economic growth with BOP equi-
librium, these estimates are also considered a measure for evaluating whether an economy has been in a

catching-up trajectory relative to the world economy (Nassif et al., 2015, 2016). Table 3 reports the average
BOP-constrained growth rate for the selected Latin American economies as well as the average world growth
rate. The World GDP data (at constant 2010 prices, in USD) were retrieved from the WDI database (World
Bank, 2017).

With the exception of Bolivia and Uruguay, there are evidences of a catching-up process by Brazil,
Chile, Ecuador and Mexico from 1970 to 2015. Similar results are found for the period 1970-1985. Yet,
between 1985 and 2000, the estimates show that the Bolivian economy embarked on a trajectory of catching
up, which continued during the period 2000-2015. When considering the last ﬁfteen years (2000-2015), this
catching-up process is only observed in Bolivia and Brazil. Following Ocampo (2013), this cyclical process of
catching-up and falling behind could be described as one of truncated convergence. Given the international
trade slowdown and the recent economic crises, the observed trajectory shift by the Latin American countries
could be the result of the fragility of their economies to external imbalances. However, one should note that
the average BOP-constrained growth rate for Brazil in the period has relatively decreased in comparison to
its past economic performance, reaching a level similar to the one shown by the world economy. Without
eﬀective measures to reverse this downward trend, this might indicate that Brazilian economy could poten-
tially face a trajectory of falling behind in the near future. Last, but not least, the results also highlight the
fact that Uruguay remained on a falling behind trajectory throughout the whole sample period.

6 Concluding Remarks
Economic growth in Latin America has been an intriguing phenomenon, driving a vast variety of theoretical
and empirical research. Given the recurrence of trade imbalances during its economic history, the Post
Keynesian theory of BOP-constrained growth has emerged as a robust theoretical alternative regarding
the potential limits of the region’s long-term economic performance. Several studies have tried to provide
empirical evidences supporting these ideas (see e.g. Thirlwall and Hussain (1982), McCombie (1997), Holland
et al. (2004), Pacheco-López and Thirlwall (2006) and Cimoli et al. (2010)).

In general, however, the Post Keynesian research has overlooked econometric issues related to structural
breaks and parameter instability over the sample period, compromising the reliability of the estimates due

16

to biases and inconsistency. Despite some attempts on dealing with those issues (see e.g. Atesoglu (1997),
Bairam and Ng (2001), Bagnai (2010)), the estimation of time-varying parameters considering the whole
sample is a subject that has yet to be properly explored. This paper intended to contribute to the debate
on this matter. Combining nonlinear Bayesian techniques and classical OLS estimations, TVP regressions
with stochastic volatility for the import functions of eight Latin American economies were implemented and
the respective validity of Thirlwall’s Law was tested.

For some Latin American economies, namely, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, the obtained results showed
that there has been an upward trend in their estimates of the income elasticity of imports from 1970 to
2015. On the other, for the second group of countries, consisting of Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay, a
rather stable behavior was observed. In the particular case of Chile, even though is estimates were relatively
volatile over time, the country has recently presented income elasticity of import demand levels similar
to those from beginning of the sample. Moreover, apart from Colombia and Peru, the BOP-constrained
model developed by Thirlwall (1979) was validated for the period. This corroborates the idea of trade
imbalances eﬀectively limiting the Latin American economic performance for the last 50 years. As to a
potential catching-up process in the region, the estimates for the theoretical rate of economic growth with
BOP equilibrium supported the idea of an overall catching-up trajectory for Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and
Mexico. Yet, one should note that the Bolivian economy has reversed its falling behind trajectory after
1985, while the Brazilian growth has relatively decreased in comparison to its past performance, leading
to uncertainty about the future maintenance of its catching-up process. On a side note, the results also
highlighted the persistence of a falling behind trajectory by the Uruguayan economy for the whole period.
