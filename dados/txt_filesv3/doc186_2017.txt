Resumo 

O  objetivo  do  estudo  é  discutir  em  que  extensão  a  relação  entre  população  e 
produtividade  é  heterogênea  para  trabalhadores  com  diferentes  perfis  de  habilidades. 
Utilizando  dados  da  RAIS  e  da  base  desenvolvida  por  Maciente  (2013),  foram 
atribuídas três notas para cada trabalhador, representando a intensidade das habilidades 
cognitivas,  sociais  e  motoras  envolvidas  em  sua  atividade  laboral.  As  evidências 
sugerem  que  os  ganhos  de  aglomeração  não  se  manifestam  de  forma  equânime  para 
todos  os  indivíduos  da  urbe.  Foi  possível  encontrar  uma  associação  positiva  entre 
habilidades cognitivas e sociais e tamanho urbano, e um efeito menos intenso ou não 
significativo para habilidades motoras. Além disso, o retorno às habilidades cognitivas é 
positivo em todo o range de aglomerações com diferentes tamanhos populacionais, mas 
o retorno às habilidades sociais é presente apenas nos grandes centros. Adicionalmente, 
interações  das  habilidades  sociais  e  cognitivas  inflam  o  prêmio  salarial  associado  ao 
tamanho urbano. 

 
Abstract 
 
We  estimate  the  urban  wage  premium  for  the  Brazilian  case,  exploring  how  it  is 
heterogeneous  for  workers/occupations  with  distinct  skills.  Every  worker/occupation 
was  assigned  a  level  of  cognitive,  social  and  motor  skills.  Using  a  rich  database 
matching  firms  and  workers,  we  replicate  the  wage  premium  results  of  other  studies. 
However,  we  were  able  to  show  that  the  wage  premium  does  not  affect  equally  all 
occupations/workers.  We  found  a  positive  association  between  cognitive  and  social 
skills  and  urban  size,  especially  for  workers/occupations  that  use  intensively  those 
skills, and a less intense or non-significant effect for motor skills. Returns to cognitive 
skills are positive across the whole range or urban sizes, but returns to social skills are 
only  present  in  large  urban  agglomerations.  Furthermore,  interactions  of  social  and 
cognitive skills inflate the skill wage premium associated with urban size.

Introduction 

The evidence on the relationship between wage levels and urban size is well established 
(Glaeser and Mare, 2001; Glaeser and Resseger, 2010; Combes et al., 2010, Ronsenthal 
and  Strange,  2004;  Overman  and  Puga,  2010;  Puga,  2010).  Explanations  are  plenty, 
such as the Marshallian triad or the micro-foundations models developed by Duranton 
and  Puga  (2004),  exploring  topics  as  sharing,  matching,  and  learning.  Larger 
agglomerations  increase  the  opportunities  for  sharing  infrastructure,  suppliers,  and  a 
labor  pool  with  similar  skills,  amplify  the  chances  of  matching  between  workers  and 
firms  in  the  labor  market,  and  create  a  higher  probability  of  learning  and  developing 
new  technologies  and  entrepreneurial  practices  (Puga,  2010;  Combes  et  al.,  2010). 
Regional  wage  differences  could  also  come  from  different  labor  force  compositions, 
geographic  characteristics  and  local  production  factors,  and  agglomeration  economies 
(Combes et al., 2008).  
Endogeneity plays an important role in this discussion: Do the city characteristics make 
economic agents more productive, or are large cities more productive because they have 
more  productive  economic  agents?  There  could  be  non-observable 
individual 
characteristics correlated with urban size biasing the identification of the impact of size 
on wages (sorting). That is the case if skilled workers prefer urban centers with better 
social,  economic,  or  urbanist  attributes,  as  well  as  the  previous  existence  of  skilled 
(Carlsen  et  al.,  2012).  Therefore,  considering  non-observed  worker 
people 
characteristics in the calculations is extremely relevant, as did Glaeser and Mare (2001), 
D´Costa and Overman (2014), Mion and Naticchioni (2009). 
Besides investigating the sources of the urban wage premium, it is important to consider 
how the urban wage premium accrues to workers with different skill profiles. The idea 
is to find what types of individuals play a key role in the increase in urban productivity. 
One  way  of  differentiating  individuals  is  through  education  levels,  but  this  is  highly 
unsatisfactory.  The  type  of  activity  performed  seems  to  be  more  relevant  than  the 
educational level (Bacolod et al., 2009; Florida et al., 2011; Maciente, 2013). In this 
study, we investigate the relationship between productivity (wage) and urban size for 
occupations  (workers)  with  different  skill  requirements.  We  study  the  spatial 
distribution of individual skills and estimate the impact of agglomeration on the hedonic 
price of skills.  
This approach is still in its infancy, especially in the literature in Brazilian cities. We 
use a database of administrative records for firms and workers, including the occupation 
of each worker. The occupations were assigned skill levels based on an adaptation of 
the American ONET survey to the Brazilian labor market (Maciente, 2013). For each 
occupation/worker,  we  have  a  skill  score  for  cognitive,  social,  and  motor  skills.  The 
relative frequency of individuals with high cognitive and social skills increases as the 
urban  population  increases,  whereas  for  motor  skills  the  opposite  is  observed.  The 
econometric exercises show that the importance of cognitive and social skills grows as 
the  city  size  increases,  whereas  for  motor  skills,  it  happens  with  less  intensity.  The 
following  sections  present  a  brief  discussion  of  the  literature  and  introduce  the 
theoretical  model.  Afterward,  we  present  a  description  of  the  database  and  the 
construction  of  the  skill  indicators  used.  The  empirical  strategy  is  presented,  and  the 
results are revealed next, together with the conclusions of the study.

Literature 

	

	

In  order  to  discuss  the  relationship  between  skills,  productivity,  and  urban  size,  it  is 
important to reflect on the meaning of agglomeration economies. Combes and Gobillon 
(2015) argue that they cover any effect that increases the income of workers and firms 
as  the  city  size  increases.  Groot  and  De  Groot  (2014)  consider  that  they  are  wage 
differences  resulting,  ceteris  paribus,  from  the  proximity  of  different  firms  and 
consumers, dense labor markets, and knowledge spillovers. Glaeser and Gottlieb (2009) 
link  economies  of  agglomeration  with  the  reduction  in  the  cost  of  transportation  of 
goods (proximity between suppliers and buyers of goods and services), people (labor 
market  is  more  efficient  in  urban  areas),  and  ideas  (cities  facilitate  the  flow  of 
knowledge between firms and persons). 
From an empirical point of view, identifying the channels leading to the existence of 
agglomeration  economies  is  a  difficult  task  (Combes  and  Gobillon,  2015).  However, 
important  advances  have  been  made  in  the  empirical  identification  of  the  sorting 
component. Sorting could occur if individuals with higher skills attribute greater value 
to urban amenities (culture, institutions, nightlife, etc.) or if, historically, skilled people 
located  in  large  cities  and  transmitted  the  skills  to  future  generations.  Ignoring  the 
sorting  mechanism  will  tend  to  overestimate  the  impact  of  agglomeration  economies. 
Empirically, it is necessary to control for individual heterogeneity (Glaeser and Mare, 
2001; Combes et al., 2008). The literature indicates that sorting is a relevant source of 
the  urban  wage  premium  (Combes  et  al.,  2010;  Carlsen  et  al.,  2010;  Matano  and 
Naticchioni, 2015).  
However,  the  evidence  on  the  different  magnitudes  of  the  urban  wage  premium  for 
workers with different skill profiles is scarce. As shown by Bacolod et al. (2009), only 
part of the workers/occupations benefit from the urban size, depending on their skills, 
and  the  premium  is  not  uniform  for  workers  with  different  skills.  They  indicate  that 
large  cities  are  particularly  good  for  workers/occupations  demanding  high  levels  of 
cognitive and social skills. Florida et al. (2011) show that the effects of analytical and 
social  skills  on  wage  are  positive,  while  the  effects  of  physical  skills  are  negative. 
Explanations include considering that skilled workers tend to specialize and, therefore, 
benefit from better matching conditions in large cities; these workers are able to learn 
from  the  rich  environment  of  large  cities;  they  can  take  advantage  from  the 
complementarity of resources available in large and dense markets. Similar conclusions 
were also present in a study developed by Andersson et al. (2014), who found signs of 
agglomeration economies only for non-routine tasks.   
This new perspective of measuring human capital makes it possible to deepen previous 
studies, offering new insights to analyze issues such as labor market characteristics or 
the dynamics of cities, providing more subsidies for policy-makers' decisions. The main 
criticism regarding the use of education to represent skills is that it may not measure 
properly  the  degree  of  qualification  of  workers,  because  it  does  not  capture  other 
specific skills that are often developed only in the work environment. For example, a 
person with 15 years of schooling could have studied Engineering, Physics, Sociology 
or any other field, but would be considered with the same skill if only schooling were 
considered.  It  seems  clear  that  professionals  in  these  fields  may  have  distinct 
characteristics  and  skills,  and  these  would  be  lost  if  only  education  levels  were 

	

	

considered. Thus, with this approach, it becomes clear that education and skills are not 
equivalent1. 
The fundamental hypothesis that makes it possible to infer the skill level of the worker 
from his/her occupation is the existence of matching in the labor market. It is considered 
that  in  a  frictionless  hedonic  equilibrium,  the  labor  market  associates  each  worker  i, 
who  possesses  certain  abilities  s,  for  occupations  j  that  require  such  characteristics, 
making it possible to map the relation occupation-skill of the worker. If this relation is 
invertible, it can be argued that the worker assigned to an occupation j has the level of 
skills necessary to occupy such job. 
The  Brazilian  case  is  interesting  for  the  diversity  of  its  urban  network  and  the  rapid 
expansion  of  the  urban  system  in  the  last  six  decades.  Although  a  reduction  in  wage 
inequality can be observed in recent years (Cruz and Naticchioni, 2012), the evidence 
indicates  a  positive  relationship  between  wage  levels  and  urban  size,  even  after 
controlling  for  cost  of  living  and  characteristics  of  workers  and  firms  (Azzoni  and 
Servo,  2002).  Rocha  et  al.  (2011)  registered  a  9.4%  wage  premium  for  metropolitan 
areas,  even  after  controlling  for  observable  and  non-observable  characteristics  of 
workers. Freguglia et al. (2007) indicated that the measured regional and sectoral wage 
differences  are  smaller  when  non-observable  worker  characteristics  are  considered. 
Silva  et  al.  (2012)  obtained  an  urban  wage  premium  of  3%,  after  controlling  for  the 
non-observable individual heterogeneity and the observed characteristics of workers and 
jobs. None of those studies, however, considered skill diversity. Examples are Barufi et 
al. (2016), who used skills as a control. They concluded that, controlling for worker’s 
skills and urban size, the sectoral composition is relevant. Ehrl and Monasterio (2016) 
discuss  the  concentration  of  analytical  and  interpersonal  skills  and  their  effects  on 
wages,  using  as  instrument  differences  in  the  distribution  of  industrial  and  liberal 
occupations  in  1872  and  1920.  The  authors  found  that  the  regional  concentration  of 
these  occupations  has  positive  externality  on  wages.  Finally,  Andrade  et  al.  (2014) 
indicated that the occupational concentration is affected by the geographical distribution 
of productive activities and by the technological intensity of each occupation. As far as 
we know, there is no study on Brazil dealing with the importance of urban size on the 
implicit price of skills.

The Model 

We use an adaptation of Roback (1982) model to describe the spatial equilibrium in the 
presence  of  agglomeration  effects  and  worker’s  skill  heterogeneity,  as  in  Moretti 
(2004), Rosenthal and Strange (2008), Bacolod et al. (2009) and Liu (2016). Suppose 
the  existence  of  several  locations  j,  composed  of  Aj  workers.  The  welfare  of  an 
individual i residing in j is given by the function  

as  numeraire; ℎ!!  refers  to  the  non-tradable  good,  typically  housing;  Aj  is  the  local 

In which X is a composed tradable good, whose price is fixed inter-regionally and used 

𝑈!,!= 𝑋,ℎ!!,𝐴!

agglomeration effect.  

																																																													
1 Several authors emphasize that skills are multidimensional and not simply identical to educational level 
(Levy and Murnane, 2003). 

	

	

The individual has a wealth dotation not related to the specific location, K, and spend 
his/her  income  buying  the  composed  good,  and  the  non-tradable  good,  at  price  rj. 
Furthermore, each worker i present a vector of individual-specific skills zi, not directly 
related to the location. Admitting that workers supply one unit of labor, the problem of 
an  individual  agent  is  to  maximize  his/her  utility  subject  to  a  budget  restriction 
described by  

𝑊𝑧! +𝐾=𝑋+𝑟!ℎ!! 

 

 (2) 

Given  the  agglomeration  level  in  the  city,  Aj,  wages  (W)  and  rent  (r),  the  individual 
must choose the quantities of services to be consumed, following the restriction, which 
is given by his/her income from wages and wealth dotation (K). Given the possibility of 
locational  arbitrage,  the  equilibrium  condition  for  the  worker  can  be  represented  in 

terms of indirect utility as  𝑉𝑊∗𝑧!,𝑟∗;𝐴! =𝑉∗𝑧  

(3) 

Each  firm  produces  the  same  composed  tradable  good  by  employing  different 
combinations  of  skills  incorporated  in  its  workers.  Each  firm  operates  with  constant 
returns to scale and show the following production function  
(4) 

skills zi; ℎ!! indicates the use of land in production, and Aj indicates the agglomeration 

In  which  Nz  is  the  number  of  workers  employed  by  firm,  described  by  the  vector  of 

𝑋=𝑓𝑁!,!,ℎ!!;𝐴!  

level in city j. The production function is convex and increasing in skills and three times 
continuously  differentiable  (C3).  Assume  there  is  free  mobility  of  labor  (Nz)  between 
localities and housing are fixed for each city. The profit maximization problem is given 
by  

  

𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝜋=𝑋−𝑟!ℎ!!−𝑊𝑧!𝑁! 
!"!!!=𝑓´𝑁!,ℎ!!,𝐴! − 𝑊𝑧! =0  
𝑊∗𝑧! = 𝑓´𝑁!,ℎ!!,𝐴!  

(6) 

 

(5) 

The optimum wage level resulting from this maximization is  

where  f´  is  the  derivative  of  the  production  function  in  relation  to  Nz,  that  is,  the 
marginal product of labor.  
Suppose that there are S skills, indexed by s. In this setup, the skill wage premium, or 
the hedonic price of skills, or the return to skills, is given by the marginal contribution 
to wage of the particular skill  

!"!!!!!    (7) 

This is the implicit price of a specific skill. This derivative allows inferring about wage 
behavior as a function of individual skills. The evidence in the literature indicates that 
higher skill levels are associated with higher wage levels. This article takes a different 
point of view, casting a new insight on the relationship between the wage premium and 
individual skill levels.  
The effect of agglomeration on wages, or the urban wage premium, is captured by the 
marginal contribution of agglomeration in production on wage  

	

	

!"!!!!!

  (8) 

This  derivative  reveals  how  important  the  urban  environment  is  in  generating  wage 
returns. The analysis of this derivative received great attention in the identification and 
estimation of the agglomerative effects associated with city size. Finally, the urban-size 
skill wage premium is given by the effect of agglomeration on the skill wage premium, 
that is  

! !"!!!!!!!! =!!!!!
!!!!!!! 

 

(9) 

This effect, which is the main interest of this paper, indicates how the implicit price of 
an individual skill is affected by agglomeration, or how the hedonic prices of skills vary 
with city size. It allows us to explore the relationship between the increase in population 
size  and  the  wage  return  associated  with  each  specific  skill.  The  micro  foundation 
models  proposed  by  Duranton  and  Puga  (2004)  indicate  the  channels  through  which 
differences  in  the  relationship  between  skill  premium  and  urban  size  are  expected. 
Individuals with a high level of cognitive or social skills are more able to benefit from 
matching, sharing and learning in large centers.  
Using  the  same  argument  for  motor  skills  is  not  straightforward,  however.  Although 
individuals with motor skills could benefit from matching or sharing, it is less likely 
that they could gain from learning. Thus, for cognitive and social occupations, there are 
more channels to justify the existence of a positive relation between the wage premium 
and city size, whereas for the motor group the argument is weaker.   
To close our model, in equilibrium, the problem of the firm can be represented by 

𝜋′[𝑊∗𝑧!,𝑟∗;𝐴! =0 

 (10) 

This expression (eq. 10), together with the indirect utility function (eq. 3), determines 
the  different  levels  of  rent  and  wage  as  a  function  of  skills,  for  each  place.  Then, 
equilibrium is described by the wage and rent levels in which (a) workers are indifferent 
between living at place j or any other, and (b) firms obtain the higher profit level.

4.1   Data 

Data and Descriptive Analysis 

We use yearly administrative records of firms and workers from a database assembled 
by  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  covering  all  firms  legally  established  and  workers  with  a 
formal  labor  contract.  It  contains  reliable2  information  on  several  socioeconomic  and 
job  variables,  including  the  description  of  the  worker’s  occupation,  and  firm 
characteristics  (sector,  size,  location,  etc.).  The  data  cover  the  whole  country  in  the 
period 2003-2013. As the database includes an intractably large number of jobs, for the 
panel  data  analysis  we  have  drawn  a  random  sample  of  3%  of  workers,  weighted  by 
municipalities (totaling over 600,000 workers). For the cross-section analysis we used a 
20% sample, for the year 2013, involving close to 6 million workers. Additionally, we 
																																																													
2 We have eliminated cases with inactive contracts, zero-wages, less than 20 hours/week, public workers, 
ages below 18 and over 65, and some clearly defective data (such as different gender in distinct contracts, 
decreasing age, etc.).  

	

	

restrict our analysis only to the private sector, to prevent specificity of Brazilian public 
sector. 
Each of the 2702 occupations received a code based on the international classification 
of occupations. This allowed Maciente (2013) to produce an adaptation of the American 
ONET  list  of  skills  to  the  Brazilian  scene.  In  order  to  reduce  the  set  of  skills  to  a 
manageable level, we have defined three types of skills to use in this study: cognitive, 
social  and  motor.  From  the  list  of  263  skills  associated  with  each  occupation  in  the 
ONET,  we  have  selected  three  subsets  corresponding  to  skills,  in  principle,  more 
relevant  for  each  of  the  three  categories  chosen.  We  then  applied  Factor  Analysis  to 
each  subset  in  order  to  reduce  the  number  of  variables,  without  compromising  the 
amount of information present in the original dataset. The three resulting skill indicators 
are not orthogonal, but preserve a desirable relation of complementarity (Bacolod and 
Blum, 2010). It is important to note that the choice of skills followed a textual analysis 
and  the  evidence  in  the  literature  (Ingram  e  Neumann,  2005;  Bacolod  et  al.,  2009; 
Florida et al., 2011; Weinstein e Partridge, 2013; Guvenen et al., 2015).  
Cognitive  skills  are  those  related  to  logical  reasoning,  to  learning  capacity,  and  to 
mastering  language;  social  skills  are  related  to  interpersonal  relations  in  the  work 
environment;  motor  skills  are  related  to  manual  dexterity  and  strength  to  develop 
physically demanding jobs. A total of 22 variables were selected, 9 for cognitive, 7 for 
social and 6 for motor skills3 (see Table 2 below). Thus, each worker, based on his/her 
occupation,  receives  three  values  corresponding  to  the  three  skills.  The  correlation 
between cognitive and social skills is positive and between these two and motor skills is 
negative. Higher levels of cognitive and social skills are associated with higher wages; 
higher levels of motor skills, with lower wages.  
The  urban  agglomerations  used  in  this  study  are  369  Labor  Market  Areas  (LMA)4, 
encompassing 1939 municipalities, which account for 71% of the population in 2013. 
Few LMAs involve several municipalities, mostly concentrated in the richer south and 
southeast regions, and 76% are composed of five cities or less. To facilitate the analysis, 
we have defined a top category for each skill, composed of workers situated among the 
20% occupations with the largest scores, and four sizes for the LMAs. Table 1 provides 
some statistics and shows that 50% of individuals work in very large LMAs, 60.4% for 
the top-cognitive workers.  
The  average  wage  of  these  top-cognitive  workers  is  over  twice  the  general  wage 
average, and the difference is larger in large LMAs. The group of top-social workers 
presents  an  average  wage  lower  than  the  top-cognitive,  but  higher  than  the  general 
average.  Workers  in  the  top-motor  group  get  lower  wages  and  are  typically  less 
concentrated  in  large  LMAs.  Wage  levels  in  large  LMAs  for  the  top-cognitive 
occupations are 46.5% higher than in small LMAs, and only 9.94% for the top-motor 

																																																													
3Other ways of constructing the skill variables were tested. We applied Factor Analysis to the whole set 
of skills. We rotated the factors obtained using the PROMAX technique, to maintain the complementarity 
between  the  skills.  Alternatively,  based  on  the  explanatory  power  of  the  skills  variables  present  in 
Maciente (2013), new skills indexes were created. The key results of this study remained. 
4The  LMAs  include  the  294  officially  established  by  IBGE,  the  national  statistics  office,  based  on 
commuting to work and study, plus 75 large cities, including the municipalities under their influence in 
the urban hierarchy (satellites), as defined by IBGE. In order to check for robustness, other definitions 
were  also  used:  (a)  the  294  official  LMAs,  and  (b)  these  plus  the  75  large  cities,  without  the  satellite 
cities. The main results of the study do not change. 

	

	

skills. The larger return occurs for the top-social skills, for which working in a large 
LMA results in doubling the wage level, as compared to working in a small LMA.

Table 2 presents information on schooling and skill levels across urban sizes. Skills are 
presented  in  the  synthetic  indicators  constructed  with  Factor  Analysis  and  for  each 
individual  skill  considered.  It  is  clear  that  the  share  of  people  with  more  education 
increases with urban size. The share of people with a college degree doubles from small 
to  large  cities.  Regarding  skills,  2.61%  of  individuals  working  in  small  urban 
concentrations  have  top-cognitive  skills,  while  in  very  large  agglomerations,  this 
percentage is 5.7%, and this share increases monotonically with urban size. The pattern 
is repeated for each individual skill within this group. In the social skills, growth with 
city size is also repeated, although the difference between small and large cities is not as 
large. Again, the pattern is present for each individual skill within that group. Finally, 
the motor skills present the opposite pattern, decreasing as the city size increases, both 
for the synthetic indicator and for each individual skill in the group.  
These results contrast with the findings of Bacolod et al. (2009) for the USA, where the 
average indicators of skills and education are homogeneous across city sizes. Eeckhout 
et al. (2010) argue that the skill distribution presents a fat tail and show evidence that 
more skilled individuals locate disproportionally more in large cities, and at the same 
time, large cities attract less skilled people too. Our results indicate that the distribution 
of skills is not uniform across Brazilian cities, but no conclusion can be drawn about the 
existence of a fat tail phenomenon. 
Although skill and education are different dimensions of human capital, they are surely 
correlated. Within workers with a college degree, 30% are in top-cognitive and 38.9% 
in top-social occupations. Only 0.2% of workers with 8 years of schooling are in top-
cognitive occupations, and 33% in top-motor occupations.

4.2   Descriptive analysis 
This  section  aims  to  provide  initial  evidence  on  the  relationship  between  wages, 
agglomeration, and skills in Brazil by exploring the cross-section data structure of 2013. 
The  hedonic  skill  price  equations  were  estimated  with  the  following  econometric 
specification: 

 𝑙𝑛𝑤!"#$=𝜑!"ln𝑝𝑜𝑝 +𝛽!"𝑍!"+𝜇!"𝑍!"∗ln𝑝𝑜𝑝 +𝛼!𝑋!"#+𝛿!𝑄!"#+𝜀!"#$ 

(11) 

with wistj standing for hourly wages of individual i in occupation j, residing in LMA s, in 
year t. Xist is a set of worker’s characteristics, including race, gender, and schooling. Qist 
includes  firm  size  and  sector  of  activity.  Ztj  indicates  the  skill  level  of  workers  in 
occupation j, with hedonic prices varying with location s.  
The  cross-section  estimated  βst  coefficients  of  Equation  (11)  show  how  wages 
(productivity)  vary  for  workers  with  different  skills  -  the  skill  wage  premium,  or  the 
skill  implicit  hedonic  price.  By  looking  at  the  µst  coefficients,  it  is  possible  to 
investigate how the skill wage premium varies with city size, by interacting skill levels 
and urban size – the urban-size skill wage premium. From these results, it is possible to 
determine urban thresholds for the occurrence of returns to each skill. Besides that, the 
previous models consider that skills have the same marginal effects on wages, but the 
marginal  contribution  can  differ  for  workers  with  different  skill  intensity.  Thus,  we 
investigate the existence of possible nonlinearities in the specification of the skill wage 
premium and the urban-size skill premium. 
Table 3 exhibits the estimated skill wage premium. The first model (column1) includes 
only  population  and  the  control  variables  and  indicates  an  urban  wage  premium  of 
3.5%. The controls presented the expected signs: wage levels grow with firm size and 

	

	

	

worker’s education and are larger for white, male, and older workers (age squared non-
significant). These results are robust and are replicated in all models.  
The next columns deal with one skill at a time, and the last column includes all skills 
simultaneously. In all cases, the controls are included and present the expected signs. 
The estimated cognitive skills wage premium (column 2) and the urban-size skill wage 
premium (column 3) are positive and significant. An increase of one standard deviation 
(0.1) in the cognitive index is associated with a 2.88% increase in the urban-size skill 
wage  premium.  This  result  shows  that  larger  urban  sizes  are  associated  with  higher 
wage returns for individuals with cognitive skills.

The  estimated  social  skills  wage  premium  is  also  positive  (column  4),  but  with  less 
intensity in comparison to cognitive skills. The interaction skill-urban size in column 5 
indicates  that  an  increase  of  one  standard  deviation  in  the  social  skill  indicator  is 
associated with an increase of 1.76% in the urban-size skill wage premium. Columns 6 
and 7 indicate that the motor skill wage premium is negative and decreases with urban 
size.  This  set  of  results  indicates  that  the  urban  wage  premium  is  directly  associated 
with cognitive and social skills, but not with motor skills.  
Finally,  model  8  includes  all  variables  simultaneously,  and  the  results  reinforce  the 
previous conclusions, but the intensity of the effects is in general lower than before, and 
motor skills become non-significant. As robustness checks, we have estimated similar 
regressions  with  the  individual  skills  replacing  the  synthetic  indicators  produced  by 
Factor Analysis. The results are replicated for every individual skill, both for the skill 
wage premium and the urban-size wage premium. We have also estimated interactions 

	

	

between  the  control  variables  and  population  to  check  for  the  possibility  that  those 
controls also vary with the population. Again, the results of interest remain.  
The  model  described  in  Equation  (11)  also  allows  for  determining  the  population 
threshold from which the returns to the skill show up. The skill wage premium is given 

by 𝜕𝑙𝑛𝑤!"#$/𝜕𝑍!", and the result of this derivative is 𝛽!"+𝜇!"ln (𝑝𝑜𝑝) . Analyzing the 

sign  and  finding  the  root  of  this  expression  allow  for  determining  the  population 
threshold. Figure 2 presents the thresholds for cognitive and social skills based on the 
results  of  model  8  in  Table  35.  The  formats  of  the  curves  are  directly  related  to  the 
functional form of the equation, to the sign of the coefficient µst and to the size of the 
coefficient associated with the skills, βst. The latter corresponds to a shift in the return to 
skills curve. If it is positive, the minimum level of population at which there are returns 
to the skill is smaller; if it is negative, the population threshold is larger. 
It can be seen that occupations intense in cognitive skills find return at any city size, and 
this return increases with city size. The situation is different for social skills: there are 
no returns for cities with a population below 757,147 inhabitants. That is, social skills 
provide  positive  returns  only  after  a  certain  city  size.  Thus,  the  returns  to  skills  are 
positive for cognitive skills, for social skills from a certain urban size onward, and non-
existent for motor skills. It seems, thus, that individuals with cognitive skills are better 
equipped to absorb the knowledge spillovers existent in urban centers, and that reflects 
on  their  wage  levels.  Individuals  with  social  skills  need  larger  cities  to  fully  benefit 
from them.

Social  skills  have  received  great  attention  in  the  literature  recently.  One  of  the  ideas 
underlying  this  growing  interest  in  social  skills  is  that  evidence  suggests  that 
technological  advancement  has  an  important  effect  on  the  labor  market,  acting  as  a 
substitute for more routine occupations and, on the other hand, complementing the more 
skill-intensive  occupations.  This  phenomenon  is  called  job  polarization,  or  routine-

biased technological change (RBTC) (Author and Dorn, 2013, Acemoglu and Author, 
2011).  Deming  et  al.  (2015)  show  that  in  the  context  of  permanent  technological 
advancement, occupations that demand social skills are those that prove more difficult 
to  automate,  since  they  are  qualifications  based  on  tacit  knowledge,  and  therefore, 
computers are not good substitutes. Their teamwork model argues that workers do not 
perform  equally  in  different  tasks;  therefore,  teamwork  increases  productivity  via 
comparative  advantages.  Deming  et  al.  (2015)  found  positive  returns  to  social  skills, 
and also that there is complementarity between cognitive and social skills. In addition, 
the  literature  documents  the  positive  effect  of  “non-cognitive”  skills,  including  social 
ones, in the labor market (Borghans et al., 2014, Weinberger 2014). 
Finally,  the  possible  non-linearity  of  the  skill  wage  premium  and  the  urban-size  skill 
wage premium is analyzed through the estimation of models that allow for the existence 
of distinct returns at different points of the skill distributions. The same Equation (11) 
was estimated with dummies for the quintiles of skill intensity of occupations. Results 
are presented in Table A1 in the Appendix and displayed in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 
presents  skill  wage  premium  for  each  quintile,  in  relation  to  the  first  quintile.  The 
horizontal lines are referred to the right axis and portray the average premium estimated 
in Table 3. The columns present the difference in wage levels in relation to the lowest 
20% occupations in skill intensity, and all differences are statistically significant. It is 
clear that the wage premium increases as cognitive and social skill intensity increases, 
and more strongly so for the former. Things are not the same for motor skills, for the 
negative premium is larger for the upper part of the distribution. Although statistically 
significant, the difference between the lowest 20% and the next 20% is small. As the 
occupations become more and more motor skill intensive, the negative wage premium is 
larger, but the differences between quintiles 3, 4, and 5 are small. 
The analysis of how the skill wage premium varies with city size, or the urban-size skill 
wage  premium,  is  presented  in  Figure  4,  in  which  only  the  dashed  columns  indicate 
statistically  significant  differences.  As  in  the  previous  figure,  the  horizontal  lines 
indicate the coefficient of the interaction between skill and an urban size estimated in 
Table 3 and are referred to the right axis. On average, the urban-size cognitive wage 
premium is positive, as presented before, and increases along the distribution of skills. 
The  more  intense  the  cognitive  skills,  the  higher  the  returns  associated  with  urban 
population, but this is only statistically significant from the third quintile on. That is, 
only the top 60% occupations, in terms of cognitive skills, present wage returns to urban 
size. The same holds for social skills, but only the 20% top social occupations present 
wage returns to urban size. Again, things are different for motor skills, since on average, 
the  coefficient  associated  with  the  urban-size  premium  of  this  skill  is  negative,  and 
more  intensively  so  as  the  skill  intensity  increases.  Contrary  to  the  other  skills,  the 
variation is not monotonic, as the value for the fourth quintile is between the values for 
the third and fifth. When all skills, in quintiles, are estimated simultaneously, the results 
hold, but the coefficients are typically smaller, and motor skills are only significant for 
the upper quintile.

The previous section analyzed the relationship between the hedonic price of the skills 
and urban agglomeration, having as reference the OLS model for 2013. In this section, 
we present evidence on the relationship between skills, wages, and urbanization after 
controlling for the spatial sorting of workers. Modeling spatial sorting is related to non-
observable individual heterogeneity. In this perspective, panel data are needed so that 
the  fixed  effects  model  controls  the  unobserved  time-invariant  characteristics  of 
workers. In addition, the possible existence of complementarities between skill mixes 
and  urban  size  is  investigated,  as  a  way  to  better  understand  how  the  different  skills 
profiles relate to urban size. Using annual data for the period 2003-2013, we estimated 
the following equation: 

 𝑙𝑛𝑤!"#$=𝜑!"ln𝑝𝑜𝑝 +𝜇!"𝑍!"∗ln𝑝𝑜𝑝 +𝛼!𝑋!"#+𝛿!𝑄!"#+𝛾!+𝜎!+𝜃!"+𝜀!"#$   (12) 

 

	

	

with wistj standing for the hourly wage of individual i, in occupation j, in LMA s, in year 
t. Xist is the individual’s schooling degree, Qist is firm characteristics (size and sector), 
vector Zt is worker’s skills. Fixed effects for individuals, time, and macro region6 were 
introduced,  and  the  standard  errors  were  clustered  at  the  level  of  occupation-year-
LMA7.  The data set is a balanced panel of individuals employed in the private sector in 
all years. The descriptive analysis of the panel, available in Table 4, shows that there are 
613,498 individuals, totaling 6,748,478 observations. There is enough variation between 
firms, occupations, and LMAs to allow for the use of such a rich database.

The  key  results  are  presented  in  Table  5.  Column  1  does  not  include  skills,  and  the 
results indicate the presence of an urban wage premium, even controlling for the spatial 
sorting of workers, but the intensity of the effect is only a fraction of the OLS estimate 
for 2013 presented before. This replicates results of other studies that show that sorting 
is  responsible  for  a  large  part  of  the  urban  wage  premium.  As  for  the  controls,  the 
results  are  as  expected:  wage  increases  with  the  size  of  the  firm  and  with  worker’s 
education.  
Models 2-4 include interactions between skills and urban size, one skill at a time. The 
results reinforce the conclusions derived from the cross-section analysis: the effects of 
cognitive and social skills on wages increase as the size of the city grows. An increase 
of  one  standard  deviation  in  the  cognitive  skill  indicator  is  associated  with  a  4.8% 
increase in the urban-size skill wage premium; in the case of social skills, by 3.9%. That 
is,  even  after  controlling  for  non-observable  time-invariant  individual  characteristics, 
there still is an increasing effect of cognitive and social skills as urban size grows. As 
for motor skills, the results indicate that their effect on wages decreases with the size of 
the city. 
Column 5 presents the results of a model including all variables simultaneously. Urban 
size and the interaction between size and cognitive and social skills maintain their signs, 
but  with  less  intensity.  Motor  skills  become  positive,  although  with  a  very  small 
coefficient.  Summing  up,  the  results  clearly  indicate  a  positive  relationship  between 
cognitive  and  social  skills  and  urban  size,  while  for  motor  skills,  the  relationship  is 
either  negative  or  close  to  zero.  In  fact,  there  is  no  clear  evidence  that  workers  with 
motor skills benefit from the urban wage premium.

As a robustness check, we have estimated Equation (12) only with men, following the 
literature evidence that there are systematic differences between men and women in the 
labor  market.  The  results  show  the  same  pattern  presented  before.  Another  check 
consisted  of  substituting  total  employment  for  the  total  population  in  the  regressions, 
but the results remained, with more intense effects, as expected.  
In  addition,  we  sought  to  investigate  whether  combinations  of  skills  provide  greater 
payback. The idea is that there may be some combinations of skills that magnify the 
skill  wage  premium  associated  with  urban  size,  since  some  skill  may  show 
complementarity with others. We have inserted interactions of skills with city size in the 
regressions. The results presented in Table 6 show that the return to the combination of 
social and cognitive skills increases with city size. No significance was found for the 
combination cognitive x motor, and a negative influence was observed for the social x 
motor combination. Therefore, on top of their isolated importance, cognitive and social 
skills can have their effect magnified when combined.

The urban environment is the locus of opportunities for workers with the right skills, as 
the  results  clearly  indicate.  But  why  would  some  types  of  occupations  have  more 
influence  than  others?  Bacolod  et  al.  (2010)  used  contributions  from  Psychology  to 
study the role of agglomeration and education in the process of skills development and 
provided  a  systemic  view  of  how  to  understand  this  mechanism.  Skills  can  be 
understood as the result of interactions between intelligence and individual traits with 
the characteristics of environments, notably education and urbanization. Traits can be 
interpreted  as  stable  characteristics  (temperament,  personality)  that  are  determined 
primarily by the genetic factor, and which signal some particular pattern of individual 
behavior.  Intelligence,  on  the  other  hand,  can  be  understood  from  a  variety  of 
perspectives, such as the ability to learn, recognize concepts, or the ability to process 
information. 
Both  education  and  agglomeration  influence  the  manifestation  of  skills.  While 
education  has  its  relevance  widely  crystallized,  other  authors  emphasize  that  formal 
education  is  not  the  only  way  to  promote  the  development  of  skills.  Informal 
mechanisms  present  in  agglomerations  can  also  play  this  role  via,  for  example,  the 
forces of learning. Besides the importance of urbanization in the generation of skills, 
their model emphasizes that urban agglomeration also impacts wages, since it is directly 
related to the application of skills in production. 
Thus, from the theoretical framework developed by Bacolod et al. (2010), it is possible 
to argue that urban agglomeration is essentially related to cognitive and social skills. In 
fact,  urban  forces  that  enhance  the  formation  of  individual  abilities,  and  which,  in 
addition, contribute to the transformation of this skill pool into wages, seem to favor 
more strongly the cognitive and social groups. The explanation for this heterogeneity 
can be interpreted by looking more closely at what these urban forces are, what their 
characteristics  are,  how  they  operate,  and  how  they  interact  with  different  worker 
profiles. 
These  forces,  which  are  inherent  to  the  urban  environment,  can  be  seen  through  the 
micro-foundations  of  agglomeration  economies,  that  is,  sharing,  matching,  and 
learning.  This  is  the  main  argument  to  justify  the  occurrence  of  productivity  gains 
resulting from the agglomeration of firms and individuals in space, as well as providing 
relevant insights to understand how distinct this effect is with respect to the profile of 
the  occupations.  It  is  possible  to  argue  that  the  abler  the  individual  is  to  absorb  the 
externalities present in large urban centers, the greater his productivity gain. Individuals 
in occupations with predominantly cognitive and social profiles are the ones to benefit 
the most from agglomeration.

Conclusions 

	

	

In  this  paper,  we  have  analyzed  how  the  urban  wage  premium  varies  across 
occupations/workers with different skills. Based on a rich data set of firms and workers, 
we  were  able  to  assign  each  worker/occupation  a  score  representing  the  intensity  of 
cognitive, social, and motor skills. The geographical analysis of these skills across 369 
urban  agglomerations,  constituting  labor  market  areas,  reveals  that  the  relative 
frequency  of  individuals  with  high  cognitive  and  social  skills  increases  as  the 
population grows, whereas for the motor skills group, it is the opposite. 
A cross-section estimation for 2013 allowed identifying a positive association between 
cognitive and social skills and urban size, and a negative (or non-significant) association 
between motor skills and population size. This exercise allowed for the determination of 
a threshold for the existence of returns to social skills, which only appeared for cities 
close to 800,000 inhabitants. Cognitive skills are present in all city sizes. The panel data 
analysis reinforced the results, showing that cognitive and social skills provide better 
wage returns in large cities, while for motor skills, the intensity is clearly smaller. These 
results are robust for different forms of measuring skills and urban size.  
An interesting exercise showed that the interaction of cognitive and social skills results 
in an additional positive effect on the magnitude of the urban-size skill wage premium, 
but  no  effect  is  produced  by  the  interaction  of  cognitive  or  social  skills  with  motor 
skills. To sum up, exploring a rich dataset, we were able to provide interesting evidence 
showing that the urban wage premium does not affect equally all occupations/workers, 
but  is  quite  selective.  The  advantages  of  large  urban  agglomerations  are  particularly 
favorable to workers/occupations intensive in cognitive and social skills, although those 
intensive in motor skills benefit only slightly.
