Abstract 
In the last years, many Brazilian public universities introduced quotas for black and/or public school 
candidates in their admission processes. The proportion of students that had been admitted through quotas 
increased substantially (from 11% in 2009 to 25% in 2014) and in 2013 a specific law regarding quotas in 
Brazilian  federal  public  universities  was  created  (Lei  de  Cotas).  In  this  paper,  we  investigate  how  the 
introduction of quotas in public universities may affects employers' perception of students and graduates 
from these universities. We explore the different timing of the introduction of quota systems in two public 
universities in the State of Rio de Janeiro to conduct an exercise where we use a difference in differences 
approach  to  compare  potentially  eligible  (black  and/or  public  school)  students  and  graduates  from  a 
university that has introduced quota systems (UERJ) to a similar group from another university with no 
quota system at the time (UFRJ). We found no effects in the probability of being employed in the formal 
sector but negative effects for hourly wages (conditional on being employed in the formal sector) for men 
who are potentially eligible for quotas and study or have studied in an environment with quotas. We argue 
that the introduction of quotas  may  have affected employer's perception of students  and graduates from 
these universities.

Resumo 
Nos  últimos  anos,  muitas  universidades  públicas  brasileiras  introduziram  cotas  para  candidatos 
negros  e/ou  provenientes  de  escolas  públicas  em  seus  processos  seletivos.  A  proporção  de  estudantes 
admitidos através de cotas aumentou substancialmente (de 11% em 2009 para 25% em 2014) e em 2013 
foi criada uma lei específica sobre cotas em universidades públicas federais brasileiras (Lei de Cotas). Neste 
trabalho, investigamos como a introdução de cotas em universidades públicas pode afetar a percepção dos 
empregadores sobre estudantes e graduados dessas universidades. Nós exploramos diferentes momentos de 
introdução de sistemas de cotas em duas universidades públicas do Estado do Rio de Janeiro para realizar 
um  exercício  em  que  usamos  uma  abordagem  de  Diferença  em  Diferenças  para  comparar  estudantes  e 
graduados potencialmente elegíveis (negros e/ou  provenientes de escolas públicas) de uma universidade 
que introduziu sistemas de cotas (UERJ) com um grupo similar de outra universidade sem sistema de cotas 
até então (UFRJ). Não foram encontrados efeitos sobre a probabilidade de ser empregado no setor formal, 
mas foram encontrados efeitos negativos sobre os salários por hora (condicional a estar empregado no setor 
formal) para os homens potencialmente elegíveis a cotas que estudam ou estudaram em um ambiente com 
cotas.  Argumentamos  que  a  introdução  de  cotas  pode  ter  afetado  a  percepção  dos  empregadores  sobre 
estudantes e graduados dessas universidades.

1.  Introduction 
In the last  years, many Brazilian public universities introduced quotas for black and public school 
candidates in their admission processes. The proportion of students that had been admitted through quotas 
increased  from  11%  in  2009  to  25%  in  2014.  In  particular,  in  2013  a  specific  law  regarding  quotas  in 
Brazilian federal public universities was created and it states that by 2017 50% of all available admission 
slots in all federal universities and institutes will be reserved to public school candidates (Lei de Cotas).  

The use of quotas and its effect is a controversial subject. On one hand, it is possible that students 
admitted through quotas are not as prepared for attending  university, what might be correlated to  worse 
grades and an increased probability of dropping out. In this sense, it is likely that their performance on the 
labor market may be unsatisfactory. On the other hand, it is possible that the gains of graduating university 
for individuals admitted through quotas might be higher than the gains for students that would have been 
admitted anyway, what would make the introduction of quotas to cause an efficient reallocation of resources 
(Bertrand et al (2010)). 

The  existence  of  quotas  in  universities  may  cause  changes  in  the  incentives  for  human  capital 
acquisition, the composition of the student body and in students' performance (Francis & Tannuri-Pianto 
(2012), Silva & Machado (2014) and Assunção & Ferman (2015)). It can also affect employers' perception 
of students and graduates from these universities. There are many affirmative action models in the relevant 
literature that show that affirmative actions may have an opposite effect to what it was supposed to do: it 
may increase the between groups inequality (Coate & Loury (1993), Moro & Norman (2003) and Fang & 
Norman (2006)). 

In this paper, we investigate how the introduction of quotas in Brazilian public universities affects 
employers' perception of students and graduates from these universities. We are particularly interested in 
the effects on potentially eligible students and graduates, regardless of their quota status. We explore the 
introduction of quotas for black and public school candidates in one public prestigious university in the 
State of Rio de Janeiro to investigate if potentially eligible students and graduates in an environment with 
quotas  have  different  probability  of  being  employed  in  the  formal  sector  of  the  economy  and  different 
hourly wages (conditional on being employed in the formal sector) from students and graduates that have 
the same characteristics but are studying in another public prestigious university in the State with no quota 
system at the time.  

The paper is organized in seven sections, including this introduction. The second section present a 
literature review. The third section presents the context of universities and student profile in the State of 
Rio de Janeiro focusing on UERJ. The fourth section describes the data and the fifth section presents our 
empirical strategy and descriptive statistics. The sixth section presents the main empirical results. Finally, 
in the seventh section we present concluding remarks. 

 
2.  Literature Review 
Employers cannot perfectly observe all candidates' abilities and the information they have access to 
is restricted to their observable characteristics. The statistical discrimination literature addresses this issue, 
specifically  the  use  of  observable  characteristics  as  a  proxy  for  non-observable  characteristics  that  are 
relevant to performance. In particular, between groups inequality may arise as a consequence of exogenous 
differences between groups and imperfect information (Phelps (1972)) or may be derived endogenously 
because of coordination failures of the disadvantaged group associated to self-fulfilling stereotypes (Arrow 
(1973)). 

Affirmative action works as a compensation mechanism for the disadvantaged group for having been 
harmed in the past. The idea is that it might eliminate inequality arising from self-fulfilling stereotypes as 
a way of eliminating asymmetrical discrimination equilibria and promoting equality. However,  there are 
many  models  that  show  that  results  in  which  group  inequality  persists  remain  possible.  Coate  &  Loury 
(1993) show that, depending on the circumstances, affirmative action in the labor market may eliminate 
negative stereotypes towards the disadvantaged group or may worsen employers' perceptions regarding this 
group (this is the case of the "patronizing equilibrium" in which employers reduce their hiring standards 
for the disadvantaged group which causes members of this group to have reduced incentives to invest in 
human capital acquisition). However, affirmative action for workers may eliminate negative stereotypes 

without  this  kind  of  side  effects.  Moro  &  Norman  (2003)  extend  this  model  by  allowing  wages  to  be 
endogenous.  Their  results  confirm  the  perverse  effects  mentioned  before  and  reveal  that  there  may  be 
circumstances in which equilibrium wages might be negatively affected in a way that affirmative action 
can actually harm its intended beneficiaries.  

Considering the introduction of quotas in universities, it is known that they may cause changes in the 
incentives for human capital acquisition, the composition of the student body and in students' performance. 
In Brazil, there is mixed evidence about the effects of the introduction of quotas in public universities on 
human  capital  acquisition  before  college.  There  is  evidence  that  the  introduction  of  quotas  for  black 
candidates in two public universities in the State of Rio de Janeiro has reduced the proficiency during high 
school of black public school students (Assunção & Ferman (2015)). In Brasilia, on the other hand, there 
is  evidence  that  the  introduction  of  quotas  in  a  federal  university  (Universidade  de  Brasília  -  UnB)  has 
increased  the  number  of  times  mixed  race  candidates  take  the  admission  exam  and  their  probability  of 
enrolling in a preparatory course but no changes were found for black candidates (Francis & Tannuri-Pianto 
(2012)). 

A similar pattern is observed for performance during college. Francis & Tannuri-Pianto (2012) show 
that there is no significant difference between quota and non-quota students' performance in UnB while 
Silva & Machado (2014) show that there is a significant negative impact of the introduction of affirmative 
action in universities on its students’ performance in a higher education national exam (Exame Nacional de 
Desempenho de Estudantes - Enade).  

The introduction of quotas in universities can also affect employers' perception of its students and 
graduates. Bertrand et al (2010) study the effects of the introduction of quotas in universities in a specific 
state in India and considering engineering major only. The authors show that this affirmative action policy 
has contributed to the redistribution of educational resources benefiting students with lower family income 
and has positively affected quota students' future wages. Students admitted through quotas are not the only 
ones who might be affected, though. Employers’ perception may change for all students with observable 
eligible characteristics, and this is what we investigate in this paper.  

 
3.  Context 

3.1 Universities and Student Profile in the State of Rio de Janeiro 

The  State  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  has  8  large  public  universities.  At  present,  all  of  them  have  adopted 
affirmative  actions  to  favor  minority  groups.  Table  1  presents  information  regarding  affirmative  action 
policies and when they were introduced in each of these universities.

In this paper, we will focus on two of these public universities in the State of Rio de Janeiro: UERJ 
and  UFRJ.  This  choice  was  made  because  UENF  and  UEZO  are  much  smaller  in  terms  of  number  of 
students admitted per year, UFF and UFRRJ have adopted bonus policies and no information is available 
about  which  were  the  benefited  students  and  UNIRIO  has  adopted  quotas  only  in  2013  because  of  the 
specific federal law regarding this matter (at this moment all other public universities in the State of Rio de 
Janeiro already had affirmative action).  

Table 2 presents the number of students who were admitted to university in the State of Rio de Janeiro 
in every year between 2006 and 2014 (freshmen only) considering only public universities. It also shows 
the  percentage  of  these  students  who  were  black,  who  previously  attended  public  schools,  who  were 
admitted through quotas, who were enrolled at UERJ and at UFRJ.

3.2 Work While at University in the State of Rio de Janeiro 

In  Brazil,  there  is  a  large  proportion  of  higher  education  students  that  work  while  at  university, 
especially  considering  students  in  private  ones.  Table  3  presents  information  about  labor  market 
participation during university in the State of Rio de Janeiro using the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de 
Domicílios (national household survey) provided by IBGE. For each university year, the average percentage 
from 2006 to 2014 was calculated. We notice that considering all university years in both public and private 
universities,  60%  of  students  work  while  studying.  When  we  consider  public  and  private  universities 
separately, we observe that the percentage of working students is higher at private universities (65% versus 
47% in public universities). Finally, for students who are working, the majority is employed in the formal 
sector (62% of working public universities students and 70% of working private universities students).

3.3 UERJ 

The admission process to UERJ is based on the performance of candidates on an entrance exam called 
Vestibular Estadual. This exam is composed by two parts. The first part is a qualifying exam covering high 
school content that is offered twice and candidates may choose to take one or both. Candidates must score 
at least 40% in order to pass to the second part, which is a written exam. At this stage, candidates must 
choose their major  and if they want  to  apply  for  regular  admission or the quota system.  Candidates are 
considered eligible for the quota system if they prove to be economically vulnerable (at the 2016 admission 
process, eligible candidates maximum gross monthly per capita family income was R$ 1,182.00). The quota 
system was adopted in 2003, but benefited groups varied over time. Table 4 presents the rules of the quota 
system in UERJ over the years.

Table 5 presents UERJ freshmen students’ profile over the years considering their ENEM information 
from  the  year  before  admission  to  university2.  Information  is  provided  for  both  quota  and  non-quota 
students. We notice that: (i) quota students are slightly older than non-quota student; (ii) the percentage of 
black students among quota students is much higher than among non-quota students (27% versus 8% in 
2014); (iii) a similar pattern is observed when we consider both black and mixed race (66% versus 30% ); 
(iv) the vast majority of quota students previously attend public schools (78% in 2014) while a much smaller 
percentage  of  non-quota  students  attended  this  type  of  school  (only  25%  in  the  same  year);  (v)  quota 
students’ parents are in general less educated than non-quota students’ parents: in 2014, more than 80% of 
non-quota students’ parents graduated high school and more than 40% graduated college while only about 
50%  of  quota  students’  parents  graduated  high  school  and  less  than  10%  graduated  college;  (vi)  the 
proportion who worked before being admitted to university is much larger among quota students than non-
quota  students  (44%  versus  23%  in  2014);  and  (vii)  quota  students’  standardized  ENEM  score  is  much 
smaller than non-quota students’ (1.16 versus 1.61 in 2014). 

Another interesting comparison between quota and non-quota students refers to what happens to them 
after  they  are  admitted  to  university.  Do  they  have  similar  probabilities  of  staying  in  the  university  in 
following years? Do they have similar probabilities of graduating? Do they make similar choices regarding 
working while studying at university? Table 6 presents evidence for these questions considering cohorts of 
admission  years  in  UERJ3.  We  notice  that  quota  students  present  higher  probabilities  of  staying  in  the 
university  in  the  years  following  admission  than  non-quota  students.  However,  their  probability  of 
graduating seems to be smaller (except for the 2008 and 2009 cohorts). Finally, considering work while at 
university (formal sector only), we notice that quota students seems to have a higher probability of working 
for most cohorts and years after admission.  
                                                           
2 Details about sample and data are available in the Data section of the paper.  
3 In Table 6, unavailable information for the 2006 to 2008 cohorts is due to data limitations of the Censo da Educação Superior 
(INEP/MEC) since individual student data is only available from 2009 onwards. Unavailable information for the 2011 to 2014 
cohorts is either because the information does not apply or because of data availability to researchers (more details in the Data 
section).

4.  Data 
We use three sources of information: (i) the Censo da Educação Superior (higher education census), 
(ii) the Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio - ENEM (high school national exam), and (iii) the Relação Anual 
de Informações Sociais - RAIS (annual reports of social information). Information from these three sources 
can  be  combined  by  individuals'  Cadastro  de  Pessoa  Física  -  CPF  which  is  a  unique  individual  
identification number in Brazil.  

The  Censo  da  Educação  Superior  (higher  education  census)  is  provided  by  Instituto  Nacional  de 
Estudos  e  Pesquisas  Educacionais  Anísio  Teixeira  (INEP/MEC),  an  autarchy  related  to  the  Brazilian 
Ministry of Education and includes information about all higher education students in Brazil. It contains 
information about students' characteristics (sex, age, race, type of school attended previously) and about 
students  while  at  university  including  the  chosen  major  and  admission  type  (regular  or  quota).  Data  is 
available yearly for all higher education students attending college since 2009.  

The  Exame  Nacional  do  Ensino  Médio  -  ENEM  (high  school  national  exam)  is  also  provided  by 
INEP/MEC and can be used as a measure of student performance. This exam is usually taken by students 
who are willing to apply for university on the year they finish high school, although it is not mandatory. In 
recent years, some universities in Brazil started using this exam as part of their admission process.  

Finally,  the  Relação  Anual  de  Informações  Sociais  -  RAIS  (annual  reports  of  social  information) 
which is provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment, includes yearly information about 
individuals' performance on the formal sector of the economy. All firms in the formal sector must report 
information  about  their  employees'  wages,  occupations  and  number  of  hours  worked,  in  addition  to 
individual characteristics such as education, gender and age on an annual basis. It is important to state that 
all results presented in this paper refer exclusively to the formal sector of the economy. This limitation is 
due to the fact that identified individual information about performance in the labor market is needed for 
the analysis and this is only available for the formal sector in Brazil. 

For each year from 2006 to 2014, an unbalanced panel was created combining these three sources of 
data for all students that were admitted into university in the State of Rio de Janeiro in that specific year. 
Only students that were admitted in only one university and that took only one major were considered (82% 
of all students).  

Table 7 presents the number of students (freshmen only) per admission year in all universities in the 
State of Rio de Janeiro and specifically in UERJ and in UFRJ. It also presents the percentage of students 
for which  ENEM scores  and sociodemographic information from  the previous  year are available.  In the 
final  sample,  only  students  for  which  ENEM  information  was  available  are  considered.  Considering  all 
admission years, in average it is possible to match ENEM scores for 55% of UERJ students and 50% of 
UFRJ students.

Table 8 presents the percentage of students and/or graduates per admission year for which there is 
information in RAIS and for which ENEM information is also available. Once again, information is provided 
considering all universities in the State of Rio de Janeiro, UERJ and UFRJ only. The last two correspond 
to  the  sample  that  will  be  used  in  some  of  the  analysis  in  the  next  sections  (the  ones  regarding  hourly 
wages).

5.  Empirical Strategy and Descriptive Statistics 
As UERJ introduced quotas in 2003 and UFRJ did not until 2011, it is possible to investigate how the 
introduction  of  quotas  in  UERJ  affected  employers'  perception  of  its  students  and  graduates  by  using  a 
difference  in  differences  approach  where  we  will  compare  potentially  eligible  individuals  (black  and/or 
public school) to non-eligible individuals (white and/or private school) in two different environments: with 
quotas (UERJ) and without quotas (UFRJ)4 We are interested on results regarding the probability of being 
employed in the formal sector and hourly wages (conditional on being employed in the formal sector). 

We will estimate two alternative models. In the first model, we will consider all university years and 

years after graduating at once (pooled version), as described in equation (1): 

 

𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑖 + 𝛾 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑗 + 𝛿 𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑖 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑗 + 𝑋𝑖

′ 𝜋 + 𝑊𝑡

′ 𝜙 + 𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑡 

(1) 

 

where 𝑖 refers to the individual, 𝑗 to the university, 𝑡 to the moment of time, 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑡 is the dependent variable 
(e.g. employed in the formal sector dummy, log of hourly wage), 𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑖 is an eligibility dummy (black, 
public school or black and public school), 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑗 is a treatment dummy (UERJ student or graduate), 
𝑋𝑖 is a vector of individual observable characteristics (e.g. age, sex, ENEM score, parental education, major 
and  admission  year),  𝑊𝑡  are  calendar  year  dummies  and  𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑡is  the  error  term.  We  are  interested  in  the 
parameter 𝛿. 

In the second model, we will consider each college year separately (e.g. first year at college, second 

year at college), as described in equation (2): 

 

 

𝑌𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑖 + 𝛾 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑗 + 𝛿 𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑖 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑗 + 𝑋𝑖

′ 𝜋 + 𝑒𝑖𝑗 

(2) 

where 𝑖 refers to the individual, 𝑗 to the university, 𝑌𝑖𝑗 is the dependent variable (e.g. employed in the formal 
sector dummy, log of hourly wage), 𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑖 is an eligibility dummy (black, public school or black and 
public school), 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑗 is a treatment dummy (UERJ student or graduate), 𝑋𝑖 is a vector of individual 
observable characteristics (e.g. age, sex, ENEM score, parental education, major and admission year) and 
𝑒𝑖𝑗 is the error term. As in the last version, we are interested in the parameter 𝛿. 

Tables 9 to 14 present descriptive statistics. In Tables 9 and 10 it is possible to compare UERJ and 
UFRJ students (respectively) in terms of sociodemographic characteristics considering subgroups: black 
and public school versus non-black and/or private school students. Information is provided by admission 
year from 2006 to 2014 and refers to freshmen students only. Tables 11 and 12 are organized likewise and 
present information considering subgroups of black and non-black students. Finally, Tables 13 and 14 are 
also organized in the same way and present information considering subgroups of public and private school 
students.  

We notice that UERJ students tend to perform worse in ENEM than UFRJ students, independently of 
the year of admission and subgroup considered. In both universities, students with characteristics that would 
make  them  eligible  for  quotas  perform  worse  in  ENEM  than  their  comparison  groups  of  non-eligible 
students. Differences in parental education are also found: UERJ students’ parents are less educated.  

Considering the probability of working in the formal sector both during admission year and five years 
later, we notice that in  both  universities students  with  characteristics that  would make them eligible for 
quotas tend to have a higher probability of working than their comparison groups (non-eligible students) in 
most of the cases considered.  In general,  UERJ students tend to present  higher probabilities  of working 
than UFRJ in both the admission year and five years later.  

 

                                                           
4 Although it is possible to identify students admitted in previous years using the Censo da Educação Superior, it would not be 
possible to identify students that  were admitted before 2003 as it is expected that by 2009 (the first year for  which there are 
identified student data available at the Censo da Educação Superior) most students would have graduated and only those who 
did not would be observed in this data.

6.  Results 
In the first model, we consider all university years and years after graduating at once (equation (1)). 
Three different samples were considered for each potentially eligible group: men, women and all (both men 
and women). All specifications include: (i) higher education census controls such as age and sex according 
to Censo da Educação Superior information; (ii) ENEM controls comprised of dummies for ENEM score 
deciles, father and mother education (both high school and college graduation dummies), elementary and 
high school completion in the expected time dummies and a dummy for maximum family income of one 
minimum wage value5; (iii) chosen major area dummies; (iv) admission year dummies; and (v) year of life 
dummies, which correspond to the year the information refers to considering admission year as reference 
(first year).  

Table  15  presents  results  for  the  probability  of  being  employed  in  the  formal  sector6  when  we 
consider: (i) students  and/or graduates with  two potentially  eligible  characteristics, i.e. black and  public 
school (columns I to III); (ii) black students and/or graduates (columns IV to VI); and (iii) public school 
students  and/or graduates  (columns VI to  IX).  Although coefficients the for the interaction of treatment 
(UERJ)  and  eligible  dummies  are  negative  in  all  cases  and  samples,  we  find  no  statistically  significant 
difference in the probability of being employed in the formal sector for those who are potentially eligible 
for quotas (black and/or public school) and study or have studied in an environment with quotas (UERJ) 
when we compare them to similar individuals that study or have studied in an environment with no quota 
system (UFRJ) at the time.  

Table 16 is organized likewise and presents results for the log of hourly wages (conditional on being 
employed in the formal sector). We notice that for men, those who are potentially eligible for quotas (black 
and/or public school) and study or have studied in an environment with quotas (UERJ) earn smaller hourly 
wages than individuals with the same characteristics that study or have studied in an environment with no 
quota system (UFRJ). Results seem to be especially strong in terms of size and significance for those who 
previously  attended  public  schools  (their  hourly  wages  are  22.7%  smaller).  We  find  no  statistically 
significant difference between groups for women, although coefficients are also negative when we consider 
eligibility because of previously attending public schools.  

In  the  second  model,  we  consider  each  year  of  life  separately  using  admission  year  as  reference 
(equation (2)). Tables 17 and 18 present results for the probability of being employed in the formal sector 
at the admission year and five years after admission, respectively. We notice that, in the admission year, 
we find some negative statistically significant effects for eligible individuals (black and public school) in 
an environment with quotas (UERJ) when we consider only women and both men and women. In the fifth 
year after admission, however, these effects are not present anymore but we do find negative statistically 
significant effects for eligible individuals (public school only) in an environment with quotas (UERJ) when 
we consider only men.  

Finally, Tables 19 and 20 present results for the log of hourly wages (conditional on being employed 
in the formal sector). In the admission year, we find no statistically significant difference in hourly wages 
for those who are potentially eligible for quotas and study in an environment with quotas when we compare 
them to similar individuals that study in an environment with no quota system. Results are quite different 
when  we  consider  the  fifth  year  after  admission.  Considering  only  men,  we  find  negative  statistically 
significant  effects  for  those  who  are/were  UERJ  students  and  are  eligible  because  they  are  black  and 
attended public schools (35.8%) or only because they attended public schools (27.2%). This effect is also 
found when we consider both men and women who are black and attended public schools (hourly wages 
are 20.1% smaller).  

 
 

                                                           
5 Results do not change significantly when the dummy for maximum family income of one minimum wage value is not included 
in the model.  
6 A probit was used in all cases for the probability of being employed in the formal sector.

7.  Conclusion 
In  this  paper,  we  investigate  if  the  introduction  of  quotas  in  public  universities  affect  employers' 
perception  of  potentially  eligible  students  and  graduates  from  these  universities  considering  both  their 
probability of being employed in the formal sector and hourly wages (conditional on being employed in the 
formal sector).  

We explore the different  timing of introduction of quota systems  in two public universities in  the 
State of Rio de Janeiro to conduct an exercise where we use a difference in differences approach to compare 
potentially eligible (black and/or public school) students and graduates from a university that has introduced 
quotas (UERJ) to a similar group in a university with no quota system (UFRJ) at the time. 

When we consider a model where we analyze all university years and years after graduating at once, 
we find no effects in the probability of being employed in the formal sector but we do find negative effects 
for hourly wages for those who are employed in the formal sector (only for men, hourly wages are 19.2% 
smaller for those who are eligible for being black and having attend a public school and 22.7% smaller for 
those who are eligible for attending a public school only).  

In an alternative model where we consider each year of life separately taking the admission year to 
be the first year, results differ slightly. Results were presented for both admission year and the fifth year 
after that. Considering the admission year, we found some negative statistically significant effects in the 
probability of being employed in the formal sector for eligible individuals (black and public school) in an 
environment with quotas when we consider only women and both men and women all together. However, 
these effects vanish when we analyze the fifth  year after admission. Results for the log of hourly wages 
(conditional on being employed in the formal sector) are rather interesting. For the admission year, we find 
no  statistically  significant  effects,  but  results  are  quite  different  when  we  consider  the  fifth  year  after 
admission, in which we find negative statistically significant effects for men who are/were UERJ students 
and are eligible because they are black and attended public schools or only because they attended public 
schools.  

These results may serve as evidence that the introduction of quota system in public universities may 
affect employer's perception of its’ students and graduates regardless of their actual quota status. Further 
investigation on this matter is needed to make sure these effects are causal and not driven by other factors. 
As next steps, we will investigate if composition effects are present and also analyze the introduction of 
quotas in UFRJ.
