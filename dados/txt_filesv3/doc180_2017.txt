Resumo:  A  intenção  deste  artigo  é  desenvolver  um  novo  modelo  de  jogo  evolutivo  baseado  na  análise 
regional  de  Insumo-Produto,  que  pode  oferecer  uma  explicação  razoável  sobre  o  padrão  de  decisões  de 
localização  das  empresas  que  competem  no  setor  automotivo  dos  países  do  Mercosul.  Para  atingir  esse 
objetivo, dividimos o Mercosul em duas regiões estratégicas: o Brasil e o Resto do Mercosul. As matrizes 
de payoff deste jogo foram construídas com base em informações recebidas das matrizes Insumo-Produto 
regionais obtidas no banco de dados do GTAP 9 e International Trade Index. Com o objetivo de capturar 
os  efeitos  de  variáveis  exógenas  que  podem  afetar  as  decisões  de  localização  estratégica,  os  payoffs 
incorporam  alguns  fatores  (potencial  de  mercado,  interdependência  produtiva  local,  incentivo  fiscal 
governamental e estabilidade macroeconômica), cujos pesos variam com cada cenário que construímos. Os 
resultados obtidos a partir do jogo dinâmico sugerem que, quando as empresas dão pesos homogêneos aos 
fatores, o equilíbrio ocorre com a disputa do mercado no local em que há o incentivo fiscal governamental. 
Uma vez que os fatores são atribuídos com pesos diferentes, o equilíbrio a longo prazo do jogo muda, o 
que fornece evidências de que disputar o mercado onde existe uma isenção de imposto nem sempre é uma 
decisão de localização ideal. Isso pode contradizer o senso comum sobre essas questões, além de contribuir 
com a literatura sobre a decisão de localização das firmas.

Abstract: The intention of this paper is to develop a new model of an evolutionary game based on regional 
input-output analysis, which can offer a reasonable explanation about the location decisions pattern of firms 
that compete in the automotive sector of Mercosur countries. To achieve this goal we divide Mercosur into 
two  strategic  regions:  Brazil  and  Rest  of  Mercosur.  The  payoffs  of  this  game  were  build  based  on 
information received from the regional input-output matrix obtained in the GTAP 9 database and from the 
International Trade Index. With the purpose of capturing the effects of exogenous variables that can affect 
strategic  location  decisions,  the  payoffs  incorporate  some  factors  (market  potential;  local  productive 
interdependence; government tax incentive; and macroeconomic stability), whose weights vary with each 
scenario we built. The results obtained from the dynamic game suggest that when firms give homogeneous 
weights  to  the  factors,  the  equilibrium  occurs  with  both  disputing  the  market  in  which  there  was  the 
governmental tax incentive. Once the factors are assigned with different weights, the long-term equilibrium 
of the game changes, which provides evidence that disputing the market where there is a tax exemption is 
not always an optimal location decision. This may contradict the common sense about these issues, as well 
as bring some contribution to the literature on firms location decision.

Introduction  
The discussion about firms’ strategic location decision is not a new topic in many fields of Economic 
Literature. The Industrial Organization (IO) approach for example, is mostly concerned with the theoretical 
understanding of the competition nature in markets when firms strategically decide where to locate. By its 
turn, Regional Economics focuses on the understanding of development as consequence of an incentive 
that is given to an economic activity of the industrial sector in a specific region.  Another important field 
of  research,  International  Economics,  contributes  to  the  theoretical  discussion  related  to  the  Location 
Theory (in general) and to the location decision of multinational firms (in particular)6.  

In  the  case  of  the  interface  between  the  research  done  by  trade  economists  and  urban/regional 
economists, we can mention Mayer et al. (2010), who show that the first tradition tries to understand why 
firms  invest  abroad  while  the  second  usually  uses  a  pattern  of  inter-regional  and  inter-city  choices  to 
estimate agglomeration economies7. 

Despite the vast literature that has been established about location decision in these three fields of 
study, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies about spatial competition lying on the interface of 
evolutionary game theory (EGT) and regional science, since the EGT models have been applied mainly in 
IO researches. Although it may still be in its infancy, this theme should attract more interest from regional 
analysis, because the competitive locational problem emerges as a prototype of many economic situations 
involving dynamically interacting decisions in which firms can learn with their own choices over time8.  

While the traditional theory of games requires that players have a very high level of rationality, the 
EGT9  model  has  been  used  to  successfully  explain  a  number  of  aspects  of  agents’  behavior.  More 
specifically,  EGT  may  accomplish  better  success  in  describing  and  predicting  the  choices  of  locational 
decisions, since it is better equipped to handle the weaker rationality assumptions.  

Considering  the  existent  literature  and  the  lack  of    contributions  of  EGT  to  spatial  theories  as 
mentioned  before,  in  this  work  we  develop  a  new    model  that  considers  the  projection  made  from  the 
Regional Economic analysis  for dynamically guiding firms to the Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS), i.e., 
to the optimal strategy location decision in the long term. The idea behind an ESS is to ensure that a so-
called mutant strategy will not be able to dominate a competitive environment that embraces the incumbent 
strategy. Furthermore, as explained in  Friedman (1991), the EGT provides a refinement of the dynamic 
approach applied in the traditional game theory, allowing an inference about which Nash Equilibrium (NE) 
corresponds to an ESS. 

 According to Samuelson (2002), the EGT model is a convenient tool especially in anti-coordination 
games, which is a model of conflict that fits well in our case of study. To illustrate and offer more intuition 
about the reason why the anti-coordination game could be applied in strategic locational decision, let us 
consider  a  scenario  in  which  there  are  two  representative  competing  multinational  firms.  Each  of  those 
intends  to  build  a  new  plant  and  choose  simultaneously  between  two  different  countries  with  similar 
potential markets. If they choose the same country, they will split the market share. If they choose different 
countries, they will avoid the competition for the market share and their payoffs will probably be higher. 
Consequently, in this scenario, the best response is to adopt the opposite strategy of their opponent. On this 
point, the model proposed here allows us to infer which country should be selected by each representative 
firm to build their new plant.  

                                                 
6 To illustrate the interface of  these  fields,  we can  mention  D’Aspremont; Gabszewicz and Thisse (1979), who considered a 
slightly modified version of Hotelling’s model, in which exists a tendency for both sellers to maximize their differentiation. This 
constitutes a counterexample to the conclusions originally presented by  Hotelling (1929). By its turn, Gabszewicz and Thisse 
(1992) provided the framework for a spatial competition model and the location of firms. 
7 Mayer et al. (2010)is an example of Regional Science studies and, in the field of Trade Economics, one example is the work 
of Chen and Moore (2010). 
8 In Chan (2001) and Fischer and Nijkamp (2014) there is a useful compendium of spatial analysis techniques which points out 
the commonalities among models used to locate facilities one at a time and to forecast the economic development pattern in an 
entire region. In this regard, it unifies  the  models applied in spatial science,  which is defined by the author as the analytical 
techniques that explicitly recognize the spatial elements and examine the determinants of location decision. 
9 A small sampling of topics that have been analyzed from the evolutionary perspective includes altruism (BOYD et al., 2003) 
and behavior in public goods game (CLEMENS; RIECHMANN, 2006; HUBERMAN; GLANCE, 1995).

Therefore,  we  present  a  study  of  case  about  automotive  plant  location  patterns  in  Mercosur 
countries10. There is a vast literature11 that provides a description of the location decision patterns of the 
North American and European auto industry over the last several decades. On the other hand, we can say 
that this matter has not been widely debated yet in South America, where the market we analyzed in this 
paper is located.  

The objective of this paper is to offer a reasonable explanation about location decision patterns of 
firms that compete in the automotive sector under a new methodology. In the evolutionary game presented 
here, we built the payoffs based on information received from the input-output methods using the GTAP 
database  and  from  the  Global  Enabling  Trade  Report12.  With  the  purpose  of  capturing  the  effects  of 
exogenous variables that can affect strategic location decisions, the payoffs incorporate weighted factors, 
whose weights vary with each scenario we built. 

Since there are multiple possible outcomes that vary with each weight we consider, our results show 
that the scenario and its inherent uncertainty may affect the strategic decisions when the outputs cannot be 
predicted. In this sense, we assume in our analysis representative multinational firms that have to decide 
between Brazil and rest of Mercosur for building a new plant. To make that decision, the following factors 
are considered: (i) potential market; (ii) local productive interdependence; (iii) government tax incentive 
and (iv) macroeconomic stability.  

In  order  to  reach  our  purpose  and  develop  the  discussion  presented  in  this  introduction,  the 
remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2  describes  the  algorithm  used  to  design  the 
evolutionary game and the structure of the payoff matrix. Section 3 introduces the regional input-output 
analysis  framework  and  the  empirical  model  applied  to  the  automotive  sector  in  Mercosur  countries. 
Section 4 brings the results of the empirical analysis and Section 5 presents our conclusions.

Methodology 
In  this  section,  we  present  some  basic  background  on  Evolutionary  Game  Theory  and  an 
Evolutionary Stable Strategy that will be used to reach the objective specified before. The mathematical 
idea behind the dynamic replicator, which is a model of evolution and prestige-biased learning in games13 
is analyzed. It is composed by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE). The analytical solution 
of  the  ODE  system  will  govern  the  dynamic  of  the  evolutionary  game  and  will  make  it  possible  to  do 
inference about the ESS. In addition, the Malthusian dynamics of the replicator is discussed. The software 
Matlab was used for plotting the phase diagrams14, responsible for mapping the dynamic equilibria of the 
proposed games. 
 
2.1 

Evolutionary Game Theory Model – EGT Model 
As written by Friedman (1991), the evolutionary game is effectively dynamic since it is based on a 
mechanism that allows one to understand how the strategies followed by the players can change as the game 
evolves. In this case, an important element is added to those considered by the  classical game theory. In 
addition to players, strategies and payoffs, it is now also considered a dynamic rule that can change payoffs 
and, therefore, the way players interact with each other over time. 

In  evolutionary  games,  according  to  Maynard  Smith  and  Price  (1975),  a  convergence  to  the 
dominant  long-run  equilibrium  is  expected.  In  this  equilibrium,  achieved  after  a  period  of  dynamic 
interaction, players must have adopted an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) that is a strategy where players 
have no incentive to abandon, unless some external force disturbs the underlying conditions of the game.  

                                                 
10 Currently, Mercosur (Common Market of the South) promotes the integration between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay 
and Venezuela, considered as States Parties, through the free movement of goods, services and factors, the establishment of a 
Common External Tariff (CET), the adoption of a common commercial policy, the coordination of macroeconomic and sectorial 
policies and the harmonization of legislation.

Then, if classical game theory can be defined as the science that studies strategic behavior, with the 
theory  of  evolutionary  games  it  takes  a  step  forward,  since  we  now  have  the  science  that  studies  the 
robustness  of  strategic  behavior.  In  an  evolutionary  game  it  is  assumed  bounded  rationality,  a  large 
population, 𝑛, of players (𝑛 → ∞) and an implicit recognition that agents learn. Every period, a player is 
randomly matched with another player and they play a two-player game. Each agent is assigned a strategy 
and they cannot choose their strategies. In other words, they are “programmed” to play a strategy in the 
initial period (𝑡 = 0) and it may not maximize their utility function. However, the systematic interaction 
with other agents will lead them to modify or update their behavior over time by choosing a given strategy. 
Thus, we can say that players imitate others’ strategies.  

4 

In this way, Friedman (1991) presents the replicator dynamics as an efficient analytical tool, capable 
of inferring the pattern of evolutionary behavior of a population of players. Considering a utility function 
given by 𝑢(𝑠𝑖, 𝜎) as the fitness, i.e., the number of descendants of an individual of type 𝑖 adopting strategy 
𝑠𝑖, against the average population fitness,𝜎, and let 𝑡 be time instant: 
𝑁(𝑡): Population size; 
𝑁𝑖(𝑡): Number of individuals playing the strategy 𝑠𝑖; 
𝑝𝑖(𝑡): Proportion of the individuals playing 𝑠𝑖, i.e., 𝑝𝑖(𝑡) =
𝑑: Population mortality rate (constant); 
𝑢(𝑠𝑖, 𝜎): The expected number of descendants (fitness) of an individual adopting 𝑠𝑖 when it competes in a 
population whose average fitness is 𝜎(𝑡).  

𝑁𝑖(𝑡)
𝑁(𝑡)

; 

The reduced form of the replicator dynamic is given by: 

 

𝑝̇𝑖(𝑡) =

=

𝑁𝑖̇ (𝑡)𝑁(𝑡) − 𝑁𝑖(𝑡)𝑁̇ (𝑡)

[𝑁(𝑡)]2

=   𝑝𝑖(𝑡)[𝑢(𝑠𝑖, 𝜎) − 𝑢(𝜎, 𝜎)] 

(1) 

 
According to Binmore (1992), the results obtained by equation (1) say that the more successful a 
strategy that competes in a population in a state 𝜎(𝑡), the greater its payoff15 and consequently the greater 
its relative growth. Thus, the replicator dynamics provides the rate of growth of the proportion of players 
that adopt a certain strategy available in the game over time. To find the asymptotically stable points, that 
is, points of equilibrium, starting from a system of nonlinear differential equations, we must (i) find the 
stationary points by doing 𝑝̇𝑖 = 0 and (ii) verify its stability. In the next subsection, we will begin a more 
detailed discussion about the stability of the system when we have two populations of players competing 
against each other, which is the situation that depicts the competitive context we are modelling in this paper. 
 
 
Two-Dimensional Games 
2.2 
 
In this class of games, we have two populations competing against each other, i.e., players from one 
population  do  not  compete  against  their  peers.  They  will  only  compete  with  players  from  the  rival 
population. In this sense, imagine a situation where each population has the same two available strategies. 
What we present in equation (2) is a system of ODEs where each population has its replicator dynamic. So 
that: 

 

𝑝̇ = 𝑝[𝑢(𝑠𝑖, 𝜎) − 𝑢(𝜎, 𝜎)] 
𝑞̇ = 𝑞[𝑢(𝑠𝑖, 𝜎) − 𝑢(𝜎, 𝜎)] 

(2) 

To  check  the  stability  of  the  points  that  are  candidates  for  an  ESS, i.e.,  an  asymptotically  stable 

 
steady state, we must use the Jacobian matrix (Ω). Calculating the eigenvalues: 

Ω(𝑝, 𝑞) = [

15 As a synonym of fitness or aptitude, we interpret payoff as rate of reproduction.

We finally have that 𝜆1,2 =
. In order for the stationary point to be asymptotically stable, 
the eigenvalues 𝜆1,2 of the matrix (Ω) evaluated at points that hold the condition 𝑝̇𝑖 = 0  and 𝑞̇𝑖 = 0 must 
have negative real parts.  
As written in Friedman (1991), in a two-dimensional game where each population has the same two 
 
strategies available,  𝑆1 corresponds to the state of the first population and is given by 𝑆1 = {𝑝, 1 − 𝑝} ∴
𝑝 ∈ [0,1]. The state of the second population is given by 𝑆2 = {𝑞, 1 − 𝑞} ∴ 𝑞 ∈ [0,1]. The matrices A and 
B,  shown  below,  represent  the  payoffs  of  population  1  (row  player)  and  population  2  (column  player), 

respectively, 𝐴 = [

According to the values of 𝑎1, 𝑎2, 𝑏1and 𝑏2there are, in total, nine possible cases16. Here, only two 
of them will be analyzed, as shown in Table 1, which are appropriate under the circumstances presented in 
session 3 of this article.

Case I matches with the anti-coordination game and case II matches with the Prisioner’s Dilemma. 
Both  of them represent  a social dilemma that have attracted significant  interest  in  social and behavioral 
science, and the evolutionary game theory approaches provide useful complementary insights into decision-
making in social dilemmas.                                      

Figure 1 shows the matrix representation of a two-dimensional game. Note that both populations 
have the same strategies 𝑒1 and 𝑒2. To find the replicator dynamics for each population, we must rewrite 
equation (2) as 𝑝̇ = 𝑝(𝑢(𝑒1, 𝑆2) − 𝑢(𝑆1, 𝑆2)). In words, the proportion (𝑝) of players in population 1 that 
will adopt strategy 𝑒1 depends on how good their performances are against the state of population 2, 𝑆2. If 
𝑒1 is a better response to 𝑆2 than 𝑒2, then the proportion of players in population 1 adopting 𝑒1 will raise 
in the long term. Rewriting 𝑢(𝑒1, 𝑆2) and 𝑢(𝑆1, 𝑆2) as follows, and after some trivial algebra we find the 
replicator equation.

For population 1, the replicator is given by 𝑝̇ = 𝑝(1 − 𝑝)[𝑎1(1 − 𝑞) − 𝑎2𝑞] and by symmetry, for 
population 2, the replicator is 𝑞̇ = 𝑞(1 − 𝑞)[𝑏1(1 − 𝑝) − 𝑏2𝑝]. The system formed by 𝑝̇ and 𝑞̇  is linearized 
by  the  Jacobian  matrix  (Ω)  and  then,  as  explained  above,  the  neighborhood  of  the  candidate  points  to 
asymptotic equilibrium is studied through the trace and the determinant of Ω.

Figure 2 - Phase diagrams for case I (a) and case II (b) 

Source: Elaborated by the authors. 

 

Figure 2 presents the phase diagram for cases I and II. We can see that case I matches with the anti-
coordination  game,  which  is  in  figure  2a.  Typically,  it  has  two  asymptotically  stable  points  (attractor 
points): (0,1), (1,0),  meaning  that  the  best  action  for  a  player  is  to  adopt  the  opposite  strategy  of  your 
opponent. The points (0,0) and (1,1) are unstable and there is a possibility for a solution to start arbitrarily 
close to that stationary point and eventually leave its neighborhood over time. The critical point (𝑝∗, 𝑞∗) is 
a saddle point and is unstable. On figure 2b, we can see that for case II the only asymptotically stable point 
is (1,1). The points (1,0), (0,1) are saddle points and (0,0) is unstable.  

 
 
The model: an evolutionary game based on regional input-output analysis 

3 

We start this session by  bringing the model designed to deal with the situations described in the 
introduction  and  in  session  2.  Let  us  suppose  two  representative  firms,  called  𝐹𝐴  and 𝐹𝐵,  which  are  the 
players of the game and produce homogeneous goods. They are competing for larger market shares in the 
automotive sector. Both firms are evaluating a region where they will install their new production plant. 
We assume that given the costs involved in re-location, once the investment decision about the regional 
location is made it is irreversible. We will limit firms' strategies between two possible regions: Brazil (BRA) 
and rest of Mercosur (RMSUR). The final decision will be based on a set of factors and their respective 
weights. In the next sub session, we present four categories of locational factors taken into account in our 
model17. 

 

3.1 

Factors Considered for Strategic Locational Decision  
 As the main objective is to offer a reasonable explanation about the location decision patterns of 
competing firms,  in  the  EGT model presented here, we built  the payoffs based on information  received 
from the regional input-output matrix and from the Global Enabling Trade Report. It incorporates weighted 
factors, whose weights vary with each scenario we built in order to capture the uncertainty inherent to a 
dynamically competitive environment. To take that decision, the following factors are considered.  

i.  Market Potential   

The firms consider the influence of market conditions, since resources must be allocated to regions 
with better economic returns (CHRISTALLER, 1966; LOSCH, 1954). Thus, a measure of the absorption 
capacity of a particular good or service in a region is necessary. We observe the demand present in 𝑅1 and 
𝑅2  in  order  to  design  a  potential  market  to  be  serviced  post-installation.  The  metric  used  follows  the 

                                                 
17 Naturally, the factors considered will depend on the activity under consideration and the time horizon of the investment. In 
this way, adjustments in the presented model are recommended.

gravitational model of Isard (1960) in which each of the regions 𝑠, located around city 𝑟, contribute to the 
composition of their market potential (𝜌𝑟). It is assumed that the attribute 𝑍 of the 𝑘 regions (e.g. income) 
is weighted by the inverse distance (1/𝑑𝑟𝑠) to 𝑟 in order to obtain 𝜌𝑟 = ∑

𝑍𝑠/𝑑𝑠𝑟

𝑘
𝑠=1

. 

 

 
Thus, the market potential was calculated based on the Gravity Model, which took into account for 
each  Mercosur  member  country:  (a)  GDP  per  capita  in  the  PPP  -  US  $  concept  and  (b)  minimum  road 
distance between economic capitals18. The values were normalized based on the highest observed value. 
The database used is from the year of 2010.  

ii. 

Local productive interdependence 

The firm will be located in an environment of greater productive integration, characterized by the 
ease  in  the  acquisition  of  inputs  -  backward  effects  (HIRSCHMAN,  1958;  WEBER,  1909).  This 
information can be easily captured through the Input-Output matrix (IO). The Production Multiplier19 will 
be considered as a proxy for productive interdependence since it is defined as the total value production of 
the good 𝑗, taking into account all sectors of the economy that are necessary to satisfy the increase of final 
demand  of  the  productive  sector  in  question.  The  equation  𝜋𝑗,𝑟 = ∑ 𝛼𝑖𝑗
  represents  the  Production 
Multiplier of good 𝑗 in the region 𝑟(𝜋𝑗,𝑟) given by the sum of the rows of the Leontief matrix (direct and 
indirect  production  requirement),  which  is  represented  by  the  term  𝑎𝑖𝑗.  The  greater  the  level  of 
interdependence of this sector in relation to the others, the greater the systemic impact in the economy. 

𝑁
𝑖=1

The  acquisition  of  the  labor  factor  is  also  observed  by  the  company  (WEBER,  1909).  We  will 
assume that it is non-mobile and its contracting will take place in the destination region of the firm. It is 
also necessary to differentiate these workers into skilled and unskilled workers, given their productivity 
difference.  The  chosen  region  will  be  the  one  with  the  lowest  labor  cost  per  unit  of  production,  either 
qualified  (𝜓1)  or  not  (𝜓2),  calculated  from  the  respective  expressions  𝜓1𝑗,𝑟 = 𝐿1𝑗,𝑟/𝑌𝑗,𝑟  and  𝜓2𝑗,𝑟 =
𝐿2𝑗,𝑟/𝑌𝑗,𝑟 where 𝐿1𝑗,𝑟, 𝐿2𝑗,𝑟 and 𝑌𝑗,𝑟 are, respectively, the total remuneration received by the skilled and 
unskilled workers in addition to the total produced from the asset 𝑗 in region 𝑟. The Input-Output matrices 
as well as the sectorial labor force were obtained by the GTAP 9 database20. 
iii.  Government tax incentive 

 

 
It is perceived that firms tend to seek the public agency ex ante the decision of a new investment. In 
this way, they might decide to locate where they receive greater incentives. In our model, this advantage 
must be expressed in terms of the market share obtained in Brazil and in the rest of Mercosur countries. 
Since taxes are a burden to the firms, when they are exempted we typically observe lower prices, which 
lead to an increase in the demand.  We will name this percentage gain as 𝜇𝑗,𝑟, and if the firms decide to go 
to the same region, the share will be equally divided, i.e., 𝜇𝑗,𝑟/2. 
In  our  model,  a  negative  shock  of  100%  was  simulated  on  the  variable  𝑡𝑜  (tax  on  the  product 
 
Vehicles and Parts in the regions BRA and RMSUR) - symbolizing the tax exemption - granted to the sector 

                                                 
18 Cities adopted as centroids: São Paulo (Brazil), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Asunción (Paraguay), Montivideo (Uruguay) and 
Caracas (Venezuela). For rest of Mercosur it was calculated by the mean of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Mining  and  Extraction,  Processed  Food,  Textiles  and  Clothing,  Motor  Vehicles  and  Parts,  Light  Manufacturing,  Heavy

region) was observed21. For this, we used the Computable General Equilibrium Model22, GTAP.

iv.  Macroeconomic stability 

Any investment in fixed capital must be done from a long-term perspective. In this decision-making 
process,  one  must  take  into  account  both  the  microeconomic  variables,  directly  linked  to  the  firm's 
performance,  and the macroeconomic  and institutional  variables, which show the specific  factors of the 
country  receiving  the  investment.  The  firm,  therefore,  may  decide  to  locate  where  there  is  less 
macroeconomic uncertainty. We will call this variable 𝜀𝑟 . Of course, the observation of this stability is 
imprecise, due to the existence of imperfect information. 

The macroeconomic indicator will be composed by two contributions: (i) The Trading Economics 
Credit Rating23, which assigns a score of 100 to countries whose investment grade is called "high grade" 
and 0 to countries that are in financial default. In this work, the indicator was normalized to a scale ranging 
from 0 to 1; (ii) Enabling Trade Index24 from the years of 2012 to 2014, which measures the favoring of 
trade in goods and services from borders to final destination. For the composition of the index, it is taken 
into  account  the  market  access,  the  administration  of  bilateral  negotiations,  the  transport  and 
communications infrastructure and the business environment. Originally, the index is provided on a scale 
from 1 to 7. Here, to simplify the analysis, the values were normalized in the interval between 0 and 1. 

 
The Payoff Matrix

After presenting all the factors incorporated in the composition of the game payoffs, the matrix that 
represents  the  strategic  interaction  between  the  players  and  their  respective  parameters  are  arranged  as

(represented by the variable to = -100 in the BRA and RMSUR regions separately) on the domestic sale of Vehicles and Parts 
(qds "MotorVcles") implemented through RunGTAP software. 
22 It is a general multi-regional and multi-sectorial equilibrium model. The global database represents the world economy for the

2-4-6 were applied.

𝑊𝜌, 𝑊𝜋 , 𝑊𝜇 e 𝑊𝜀 represent the weights attributed to each of the factors. The sum of all weights equals one 
unit. It should be emphasized that the weights depend on the nature of the activity studied. This structure is 
very flexible, since we can define in different ways the regions and sectors to be analyzed. When changing 
any of these components, adjustments must be made26. 
 
 
The Empirical Model 
3.3 
 
In this section, an empirical exercise will be presented using the approach described above, in order 
to validate it as an adequate study instrument for the locational decision. In this way, suppose that two firms 
(𝐹𝐴, 𝐹𝐵) belonging to the automotive sector are deciding to locate in some Mercosur country, aiming to 
meet the potential demand of the market. To do so, our analysis will make the spatial division between 
Brazil (BRA) and rest of Mercosur (RMSUR). When locating in any of these regions the firms will incur a 
unique transaction fee among the participants of the block (member countries). Thus, the locational decision 
will be based on internal attributes of each region. 
 
As explained before, in order to analyze the strategic decision on the location of firms, scenarios 
were created according to the attribution of weights to the four factors that make up the final payoff to be 
inserted  in  the  matrix  of  the  game.  This  framework  is  in  accordance  with  the  mechanical  system  of 
Varignon, as presented by Weber (1909). It is known that these are dependent on the specific production 
characteristics of each firm. In this way, we consider five distinct scenarios, as presented in Table 2.

As seen in Table 2, in scenario 1, firm A and firm B give equal importance to observed factors. In 
scenario 2, the firms emphasize the demand side, observing the potential market. Scenario 3 is where they 
observe possible  gains  through productive interdependence.  In scenario 4, there is  a strong influence of 
state action through fiscal  policy, and finally in  scenario 5, firms  observe the results of macroeconomic 
stability presented by region 𝑟, which would be closer to the decision strategy of multinational firms. In the 
next section, we will present the results of the evolutionary game obtained from the empirical model.

Results 

This  section  brings  the  results  of  the  empirical  exercise.  We  analyze  and  discuss  scenarios  one 

through five in sequence.   

Scenario 1 – Homogeneous weights: Note in the left side of Figure 4, that if we assign homogeneous weights 
to  all  factors  and  if  the  Brazilian  government  grants  tax  exemption,  the  Nash  Equilibrium  of  the  game 
coincides  with  the  Evolutionary  Equilibrium.  In  other  words,  the  coordinate  (1,1)  emerges  as  the  only 
                                                 
26 Equal weights are given to the acquisition of inputs and labor power, as well as the use of skilled and unskilled labor. 

 
asymptotically stable point. Therefore, there is a dominant strategy for both representative firms, which is 
to  locate  in  Brazil.  Thus,  both  firms  will  compete  for  the  Brazilian  market  share  and  none  of  them  has 
incentives to install their plants in RMSUR. On the other hand, from the right side of Figure 4, it is possible 
to conclude that if the tax exemption is given in RMSUR, the evolutionary stable strategy is the point (0,0). 
Thus, the best response for both firms is to decide to locate in RMSUR.

 Figure 9, available in the appendix, shows the phase diagram, where we can see the dynamics of 
the game over time when firms are facing scenario1 with the tax exemption given in Brazil. Figure 10, also 
in  the  appendix,  corresponds  to  the  dynamics  for  tax  exemption  in  RMSUR.  Therefore,  giving 
homogeneous weights to the observed factors, the evolutionary stable strategy is to decide to locate where 
the government tax exemption is granted.   

Scenario 2 – Emphasis on the potential market: In case the firms attribute greater weight to the region’s 
sales potential and if the tax exemption is given in Brazil, what we observe from the left side of Figure 5 is 
that the asymptotic equilibrium of the game corresponds to the coordinate (1,1). Thus, both representative 
firms  will  decide  to  build  their  new  plant  in  Brazil.  In  Figure  11  of  the  appendix,  the  phase  diagram  is 
presented and we can see the dynamic of the game under the situation mentioned above.

However, if the tax exemption is granted by the rest of Mercosur countries, what is configured is an 
anti-coordination game. Under these circumstances, typically, when analyzing the results based on the Nash 
Equilibrium approach, we verify the existence of two N.E. in pure strategies, given by the points (1,0) and 
(0,1). There also exists an N.E. in mixed strategy (𝑝∗, 𝑞∗). From the refinement provided by evolutionary 
game theory, it is possible to eliminate one of the N.E., once we see in Figure 12 (appendix) that the point 
(𝑝∗, 𝑞∗) corresponds to a saddle point. Thus, it is not asymptotically stable.  

Therefore,  we  managed  to  eliminate  the  Nash  equilibrium  in  mixed  strategy  of  the  game,  which 
allows us to infer that the best response for a representative firm is to adopt the (pure) strategy opposite to 
that chosen by its opponent. In practice, what we observe is an equilibrium where one type of representative 
firm located in BRA and another in RMSUR. This result suggests that, from the perspective of potential 
demand,  it  is  not  always  an  optimal  decision  to  locate  and  compete  in  the  market  where  there  is  a  tax 
exemption. 

11 

 
Scenario 3 – Emphasis on the local productive interdependence: In this scenario, where greater weight is 
attributed to the gains obtained through productive interdependence, the same asymptotic equilibriums of 
the previous scenario were found. Thus,  given a  tax exemption  in  Brazil, both  representative firms will 
choose it as the destination region. Once the government tax exemption is given in RMSUR, a game of 
anti-coordination is set up again and, therefore, the best response of a firm will be to choose the region 
opposite to that chosen by its opponent. Thus, the ESSs’ of the game are given by the points (1,0) and (0,1) 
(𝑝∗, 𝑞∗) is said to be a saddle point. 

As seen in the previous scenario (Figure 6), this result suggests that, from the perspective of local 
productive interdependence, it is not always an optimal decision to locate and compete in the market where 
there is a tax exemption.

Scenario 4 – Emphasis on the government exemption tax: What is observed in the game payoff matrix for 
scenario 4 is the configuration of an equilibrium where the region selected by both representative firms is 
exactly the one in which there is the fiscal incentives.  

This can be visualized in the phase diagram presented on Figures 15 and 16 (appendix). For the tax 
exemption given in Brazil, the asymptotic equilibrium of the game is given by the coordinate (1,1) and, for 
the fiscal incentive given in RMSUR, what is observed by the diagram is that the equilibrium is obtained 
in the coordinate (0,0).

Scenario  5  –  Emphasis  on  the  macroeconomic  stability:  When  firms  attribute  greater  weight  to 
macroeconomic stability, for a given tax exemption in Brazil we observe that both representative firms will 
be located there. On the other hand, given a shock in RMSUR, a game of anti-coordination is characterized.   
Once  again,  the  interior  point  (𝑝∗, 𝑞∗)  does  not  set  up  an  ESS  and  the  mixed  strategy  can  be 
eliminated from the set of solutions. The evolutionary stable strategies are given by the coordinates (1,0) 
and (0,1). Thus, as shown before, the best strategic decision for a firm is to play the strategy opposite to 
that chosen by its opponent.

Conclusion 
5 
In  this  paper  we  proposed  an  evolutionary  game  theory  model  to  explain  the  decision-making 
 
process about the location pattern of firms. In this context, we analyzed the automotive sector in Mercosur 
Countries, where under a government tax exemption, the representative multinational firms had to decide 
between Brazil and rest of Mercosur countries for building a new plant. We also designed scenarios where 
firms assigned weights to the factors (market potential; local productive interdependence; government tax 
incentive; and macroeconomic stability) that influence the location decision.  

The results obtained from the dynamic game suggest that when firms give homogeneous weights to 
the factors, the equilibrium occurs with both competing in the market in which there was the governmental 
tax incentive. Once the factors are assigned with different weights, the long-term equilibrium of the game 
changes, which provides evidences that competing the market where there is a tax exemption is not always 
an optimal location decision. This may contradict the common sense about these issues. 

The  largest  contribution  of  the  Evolutionary  approach  can  be  seen  in  Scenarios  2,  3  and  5, 
specifically  when  the  tax  incentive  is  given  in  RMSUR.  What  is  observed  is  the  formation  of  an  anti-
coordination  game.  By  eliminating  the  Nash  equilibrium  in  mixed  strategies  (𝑝∗, 𝑞∗)  of  the  set  of  best 
responses, only the pure strategies BRA and RMSUR are supported as ESS. In this way, firms that compete 
in this market can make a more controlled and less risky decision on which region to settle. Put another 
way,  firms  can  infer  about  which  game,  in  fact,  is  played  in  order  to  achieve  the  long-term  dynamic 
equilibrium and correctly decide in which region they must install their new plant.  

In  terms  of  investment  policy,  the  outcomes  essentially  expose  the  importance  of  these  policies 
when inserted in a favorable economic environment. In other words, the results suggest that, besides the 
tax  exemption,  the  firms  attribute  a  significant  relevance  to  market  potential,  local  productive 
interdependence and macroeconomic fundamentals. This may justify the results observed in Scenarios 2, 3 
and  5,  in  which,  despite  tax  incentives  offered  by  the  other  Mercosur  countries,  there  is  still  an  ESS 
characterized by firms locating in Brazil. 

One limitation of this work was the fact that it did not use the information derived from the regional 
input-output matrix in a disaggregated form for each of the Mercosur countries. By doing so, it would be 
possible  to  say  which  country  would  be  chosen  for  the  installation  of  the  automotive  plant  due  to  a 
government tax incentive. For future research, a modeling to be developed can consider stochastic elements 
in the EGT model proposed in this paper by using an Agent Based Simulation approach. Another possibility 
is to advance in the framework presented here in terms of the factors considered in the decision-making 
process, as well as the elaborated scenarios, available regions and expand the study to other sectors of the 
economy.
