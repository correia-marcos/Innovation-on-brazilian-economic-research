SUMMARY 

Brazil  has  taken  an  active  stance  in  the  Climate  Change  Negotiations,  confirming  goals  to 
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and proposing sectoral mitigation plans. Recent Brazilian 
industrial policies attempt to accelerate the industrial growth and, among other goals, develop a more 
efficient industry in terms of energy use. However, typical mechanisms of mitigation policies, such as 
carbon pricing, can act in a counterproductive way against the incentives of the industrial policy. In this 
paper  we  fill  a  gap  in  Brazilian  literature,  estimating  the  impact  of  policies  to  reduce  emissions  in 
Brazilian  industry,  imposing  caps  to  the  emissions  (CAP  scenario)  or  carbon  markets  (CAP-AND-
TRADE  scenario).  The  results  show  the  importance  of  sectoral  considerations  and  the  design  of 
mechanisms in the formulation of mitigation policies. The CAP scenario makes productions costs more 
expensive  for  important  sectors  in  the  investment  composition  (cement,  steel,  non-metallic)  and 
relatively  benefits  consumer  goods  sectors  (textiles,  clothing  and  footwear).  The  CAP-AND-TRADE 
scenario can achieve the same emission reduction goals with less adverse effects.

RESUMO 
 

 O Brasil tem se posicionado de maneira mais ativa nas negociações sobre mudanças climáticas, 
ao confirmar metas voluntarias de redução de emissões e propor Planos Setoriais de Mitigação de GEE. 
Par e passo com os planos setoriais, o país procura implementar políticas de estímulos ao crescimento 
do  setor  industrial,  que  tem  perdido  participação  e  competitividade  na  economia.  Não  há  uma 
preocupação de mitigação de GGE nas políticas industriais, que podem até aumentar emissões. Além 
disso, os mecanismos típicos de políticas de mitigação, como a precificação de carbono, podem atuar de 
forma contraproducente com os incentivos  de políticas industriais. Este trabalho preenche uma lacuna 
na literatura brasileira, estudando o impacto de políticas de redução de emissões na indústria brasileira, 
como a imposição de tetos de emissões ou mercado de carbono. Os resultados mostram a importância 
de  considerações  setoriais  e  de  desenho  de  mecanismos  na  formulação  das  políticas  de  mitigação.  A 
política de imposição de metas encarece os custos de produção de setores importantes na composição do 
investimento  (cimento,  aço,  não-metálicos)  e  beneficia  relativamente  setores  de  bens  de  consumo 
(têxteis, vestuários e calçados). A política de mercado de carbono consegue atingir as mesmas metas de 
redução de emissões com efeitos menos adversos.

1.  INTRODUCTION  

 
Brazil  has  taken  an  active  stance  in  the  Climate  Change  Negotiations,  confirming  goals  to 
reduce  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (GHG)  and  proposing  sectoral  mitigation  plans.  A  first  step  has 
already been taken in this sense at the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Copenhagen (2009), Cancun 
(2010)  and  Paris  (2015),  where  Brazil  confirmed  its  voluntary  national  goals  of  greenhouse  gases 
emission reductions of 43% below 2005 levels in 2030, according the  Brazilian  Intended  Nationally 
Determined Contributions – INDCs.  

 In  Brazil,  authorities  have  pointed  the  deforestation  control,  especially  in  Amazon,  as  the 
country’s main proposal to reduce GHG emissions. However, from 2005 to 2012, there was a decline 
in  the  deforestation  rates,  indicating  a  consequently  reduction  on  emissions  associated  to  changes  of 
land-use (INPE, 2012). According the most recent Brazilian Inventory of Greenhouse Gases, the share 
of  emissions  from  land  use  change  and  forestry  have  declined  from  61%  to  22%  between  2005  and 
2010. So, the relative importance of GHG emissions derived from fuel usage and productive processes 
have increased significantly, in the same period (MCTI, 2013). This importance is intensified due to 
the emissions tendency to increase in use of energy, transportation (especially related to diesel usage), 
oil refining, and  activity of industrial sectors. Some initiatives, in this context, have already started to 
emerge. As part of the NPCC, for example, Mitigation Sectoral Plans of GHG were released in 2013 for 
Agriculture,  Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Manufacturing  Industry  as  a  whole,  proposing  goals  and  some 
mitigating measures against global warming.  

Along with the NPCC, the country seeks to implement policies to estimate the industrial sector 
growth, which has lost participation and competitiveness in the Brazilian economy. There is no obvious 
concern with GHG mitigation in industrial policies, which may even increase the emissions. The recent 
Brazilian industrial policies seek to promote the increase in productive efficiency, the incentive of asset 
and  capital  sectors,  taking  advantage  of  environmental  opportunities  and  of  business  related  to  the 
energy  sector,  diversification  of  exports,  among  others.  This  policy  presents  ambitious  goals,  such  as 
expanding  investments  participation  in  the  GDP,  increasing  the  expenditure  in  research  and 
development and increase of worker’s qualification. 

The  Brazilian  industrial  policy  has  goals  for  a  cleaner  production  system,  which  implies  the 
reduction of energy consumption by unit of the industrial GDP. This goal, direct and indirectly aims at 
the reduction of GHG emissions. Thus, there is a relationship between the  two policies, the  Brazilian 
industrial  policy  and  the  NPCC.  However,  typical  mechanisms  of  mitigation  policies,  such  as  carbon 
pricing, can act in a counterproductive way against the incentives of the industrial policy.  The aim of 
this  work  is  to  verify  the  costs  for  the  industrial  sector  and  for  investment  that  an  eventual  carbon 
pricing  policy  would  cause.  To  achieve  that  objective,  we  apply  a  computable  general  equilibrium 
model  especially  adapted  for  the  question  of  carbon  pricing  and  energy  demand,  especially  for  the 
industrial sector. 
 
There  is  a  great  debate  currently  underway  on  the  GHG  mitigation  policies  framework:    by 
market  mechanisms,  such  as  taxes,  subsidies  and  carbon  market,  or  by  regulations  (e.g.  government 
regulations,  performance  standards,  and  voluntary  programs).  An  alternative  and  very  probable 
scenario, with the non-approval of a global agreement, and one that has been globally discussed would 
be the creation and strengthening of national policies for GHG reduction, which could take the form of 
taxation policies or carbon markets. According to Al-Min et al., (2009), the question posed is whether 
such  measures  and  mitigation  policies  will  be  durable  and  lasting  enough  to  provide  the  necessary 
reductions in GHG emission. Systems of mitigation application are still in debate, especially about the 
use of market mechanisms and preferences.  

There  are  many  examples  of  national  tax  policies  and  carbon  markets.  Denmark  and 
Switzerland,  for  example,  are  the  major  countries  to  adopt  taxes  over  carbon  and  reach  goals  of 
emission  reduction  proposed  by  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  The  greatest  carbon  market  is  the  EU  ETS 

 

28 

(European Union’s Emissions Trade Scheme), in the European Union, which according to Gregoriou et 
al.  (2014),  in  2011,  presented  a  11  %  growth,  reaching  a  total  amount  of  US$  176  billion.  The 
European Union has served as an example in proposing similar schemes in the United States, Canada 
and New Zealand.  

In Brazil, the NPCC still has as its base actions of monitoring, supervision, control, licensing and 
funding line. There is, however, the possibility of instituting tools specifically designed to create a price 
signaling  for  the reduction of  GHG  emissions, which have been widely  discussed in the international 
scenario. The creation of economical instruments pre-induced for GHG emissions – such as an emission 
trade  system  between  sectors  –  can  be  a  cheaper  alternative  to  expand  the  array  of  options  available 
within the National Policy on Climate Change proposed by Brazil. It is recommendable, however, that 
the cost-effectiveness relation of such policies be analyzed.  

The mitigation or reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases is a global “public good”1 whose 
benefits reach all, while costs are passed on to those financing the mitigation. In contrast to other public 
goods, such as public safety, the mitigation benefits are not immediate, and on the contrary, can only be 
felt  in  the  future,  something  that  compromises  the  implementation  of  policies.  Literature  on  the 
ramifications of a carbon market implementation in Brazil is still limited 2. As far as is known, there 
are  no  other  studies  estimating  the  effects  of  a  national  emission  trade  system  for  the  different 
sectors.  Economic  impacts  for  Brazil  in  a  global  market  scenario  of  certificates,  however,  can  be 
found in Feijó and Porto Júnior (2008). 

 In this context, this study fills a gap in Brazilian literature, estimating the viability and the cost 
of a mitigation emission policy trough a national carbon market among industrial sectors, taking as an 
example  what  happens  in  the  EU  ETC.  Like  many  other  developing  countries,  Brazil  faces  a  double 
challenge of promoting development and reducing its emissions. Therefore, in face of this new scenario 
and  of  the  new  post-2012  context,  it  is  important  to  study  the  perspectives  and  policies  for  carbon 
market development in Brazil. Such alternatives can characterize a more active way for the country to 
contribute to the mitigation of global warming and lead this trend among other developing countries.  

In  methodological  terms,  we  developed  an  applied  dynamic-recursive  general  equilibrium 
model,  called  BeGreen  (Brazilian  Energy  and  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  General  Equilibrium 
Model),  built  for  Brazil’s  reality  and  specificities,  with  energetic  and  environmental  detailing 
empowered to analyze policies of GHG reduction on the economy. The model is innovative in many 
aspects for the Brazilian literature: it has a high desegregation of energetic products and sectors, it is a 
recursive  dynamics  CGE  model  and  it  has  differentiated  energetic  and  environmental  specification. 
Besides this introduction, the paper is organized in three  more sections: the  second section details the 
methodology  developed  to  project  the  effects  of  mitigation  policies  on  the  Brazilian  economy.  Third 
section  shows  the  main  results  of  mitigation  policies  simulated.  At  last,  the  final  considerations  are 
made.  
 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                      
1 Public goods are defined as those whose individuals cannot be excluded from its consumption (non-excludable) and 
the  supply  does  not  depend  on  the  number  of  agents  reached  (non-rival).  Therefore,  the  rights  for  the  ownership  of 
public goods are not defined and, thus, exchanges by other goods ended up not being made in an efficient way in the 
competitive market and an intervention of public policies is necessary so that the efficiency can be achieved.

Margulis and Dubeux (2010), Gurgel (2012)].

2. Methodology 
 
2.1 BeGreen Model 

 

The  general  equilibrium  approach  has  been  increasingly  used  to  evaluate  environmental 
policies impacts. The reason is that a policy that aims  to decrease pollution emission significantly 
can have significant effects on prices, quantities and on the structure of an economy. Producers’ and 
consumers’  behavior  is  affected  by  emissions  effects  on  production  and  consumption,  and  by  the 
implementation  of  pollution  control  policies.  Additionally,  a  CGE  model  makes  it  possible  to 
analyze impacts on distribution and on the welfare of policies from different tax instruments, such 
as  quotas,  taxes,  subsides  or  income  transfers,  whose  effects  can  be  transmitted  through  several 
markets  (WING,  2004,  TOURINHO  et  al.,  2003).  Accordingly,  our  model  has  three  important 
advances: i) detailed energetic specification, ii) an environmental module that allows a projection of 
emission reduction policies, and iii) a structure of recursive dynamics.  

The  first  two  elements  are  fundamental  to  the  goal  of  this  paper,  as  they  allow  a  consistent 
analysis  of  policies  for  greenhouse  gas  mitigation  (GHG)  for  the  Brazilian  economy  through  the 
incorporation of a detailed energetic and environmental specification module. Additionally, the model is 
calibrated  with  the  latest  data  from  national  accounts,  with  an  input-output  matrix  and  the  Brazilian 
emission inventory from 20053. The structure of recursive dynamics aggregates one more differential. 
Since it is a long-term matter, the responses to policies depend significantly on projections of a baseline 
scenario  to  the  economy,  involving  presumptions  about  growth  rates  of  uncountable  macroeconomic 
variables, such as GDP, population, consumption, and investment for several years. This aspect allows 
the implementation of simulations in which restrictions of GHG emissions are relative to this baseline 
scenario as proposed by the National Policy on Climate Chance.  

These  characteristics  in  CGE  models  (recursive  dynamics  and  detailed  energetic  and 
environmental specification) are relatively new in the Brazilian literature. The BeGreen model is a CGE 
model  with  recursive  dynamics  for  the  Brazilian  economy,  empowered  with  an  environmental  and 
energetic analysis. The database includes a high level of product and sector disaggregation, enabling a 
detailed treatment of energy and emissions. It enhances the models’ capacity to analyze the impact of 
greenhouse  gas  mitigation  policies.  The  model  is  multiproduct,  comprised  of  124  products  and  58 
sectors.  In  addition  to  that,  we  also  add  14  final  demand  components  -  household  consumption  (10 
representative families)4, government consumption, investments, exportation and stocks - three primary 
factor elements (capital, labor and land), two margin sectors (trade and transportation), importations by 
product  for  each  one  of  the  58  sectors  and  14  components  of  final  demand,  and  an  aggregation  of 
indirect taxes on production. 

In  general,  the  central  structure  of  the  CGE  model  is  comprised  of  equation  blocks  that 
determine supply and demand relationships, derived from the optimization hypothesis, and conditions of 
market balance. Additionally, several macro aggregates are defined in this block, such as employment 
level, balance of trade and price indexes. Productive sectors minimize the production costs subject to a 
technology of constant scale returns.  

One  of  the  model  distinguishing  features  refers  to  the  technological  vectors  from  specific 
energy-intensive  sectors  and  energy  compounds  to  other  sectors.  In  the  description  of  the  model  that 
follows we concentrate on the special features of the model; detailed equations can be found in Annex 1 
 
 
                                                      
3 The model is supplied by an extensive set of data that reflects the structure of the Brazilian economy in 2005. These 
data are obtained from several sources: National Accounts and Input-Output Matrix (IBGE), International Trade 
(SECEX), Family Budget Survey (POF-IBGE). 
4 The families are aggregated according to income deciles obtained from POF data, totaling 10 representative families.

2.1.1. Production structure 

 
In our model, each sector can produce more than one product, making use of various types of 
energy  inputs,  intermediate  inputs  and  primary  factors  such  as  labor,  capital  and  land.  In  each  sector 
firms have an optimizing behavior, in which inputs choose a combination which minimizes the cost of 
production for a given level of product subject to constant returns to scale technology. However, a major 
enhancement  of  the  theoretical  structure  of  production  with  regard  to  energy  specification  is 
fundamental to the issues to be addressed in this thesis. The model, specifies two distinct categories of 
productive  sectors  grouped  as  follows:  i)  sectors  with  manufacturing  technologies  and  technological 
vectors ii) replacement with sectors structures between energetic compounds. 

An effort was made to move towards a more realistic approach for "bottom-up" in the modeling 
of energy-intensive sectors. BeGreen model brings, as an innovation for Brazilian models, the bottom-
up  approach  known  as  "Technological  Bundle"  (MCDOUGALL,  1993;  HINCHY  and  HANSLOW, 
1996;  ABARE,  1996).  This  approach  includes  particular  energy-intensive  sectors  where  the  input 
substituting  options  are  relevant  for  the  purpose  of  simulating  mitigation  of  greenhouse  gas  policies. 
Different technologies can be partially replaced (using a hypothesis of imperfect substitutability) using 
CRESH production functions (constant ratio of elasticities of substitution, homotheticity) (HANOCH, 
1971;  DIXON  et  al.,  1982).  This  structure  was  inspired  by  the  ABARE-GTEM  model  (Australian 
Bureau  of  Agriculture  and  Resource  Economics  Global  Trade  and  Environment  Model),  a  dynamic 
CGE  model  for  the  treatment  of  global  environmental  issues  (ABARE,  1996).  The  specification  of 
"technology  bundle"  poses  a  restriction  on  the  substitution  of  inputs,  making  it  consistent  with  the 
characteristics  of  well-known  technologies.  This  avoids  the  possibility  of  obtaining  replacement  or 
technically  unfeasible  combinations  of  inputs.  Two  sectors  fall  into  this  category  due  to  their  well 
characterized production technologies: Electricity generation and Steel and iron industry.  

In the production process of the others sectors, the representation of the technology allows for 
various substitution possibilities among different types of fossil fuel and non-fossil energy, in addition to 
other  intermediary  inputs  and  primary  factors.  Firms  choose  the  composition  of  energy  inputs  from 
three composites: Renewable composite, self-generation of electricity and non-renewable composite. In 
renewable composite through a CES function, firms choose the composition of renewable energy inputs 
(firewood, charcoal, alcohol, sugar cane bagasse, hydropower). In turn, the non-renewable composite, 
they choose among non-renewable inputs (oil, natural gas, LPG, diesel oil, fuel oil, gasoline, kerosene, 
coke, other refinery products). 

 

2.1.2 Final Demand 

 
The  model  divides  households  into  different  income  groups.  Households  are  disaggregated 
according  to  income  deciles  obtained  from  Brazilian  Consumer  Expenditure  Survey  (POF  data), 
providing  ten  representative  households.  This  nationwide  survey  provides  detailed  information  on 
household  income  and  expenditures  including  electricity,  gasoline  and  other  energy  goods.  For 
households, the initial factor endowments are fixed. They, therefore, supply factors in a non-elastic way. 
The  household  demand  is  specified  by  a  non-homothetic  Stone-Geary  utility  function  (Peter  et  al., 
1996).  Demand  equations  are  derived  from  a  utility  maximization  problem  whose  solution  follows 
hierarchical steps. On the first level there is a CES substitution between domestic and imported goods. 
At this level, the possibility of substitution between gasoline and alcohol was introduced through a CES 
function. This compound was chosen because of the real possibility of this substitution, boosted by the 
increasing  use  of  vehicles  with  flex-fuel  technology  in  Brazil,  whose  composition  depends  on  the 
relative prices of both products. 

In subsequent top level there is a Klein-Rubin aggregation of the composed goods; so the utility 
derived from consumption is maximized according to this utility function. This specification gives rise 

 

28 

to  the  linear  expenditure  system  (LES),  in  which  the  participation  of  expenses  above  the  subsistence 
level for each good represents a constant proportion of the total subsistence expense for each household. 
The composition of consumption by domestic and imported products is controlled by constant elasticity 
of substitution functions (CES).  

The standard small country assumption is made implying that Brazil is a price-taker in import 
markets.  However,  because  the  imported  goods  are  differentiated  from  the  domestically  produced 
goods,  the  two  varieties  are  aggregated  using  a  CES  function,  based  on  the  Armington  assumption. 
Exports  are  linked  to  the  demand  curves  negatively  associated  with  domestic  production  costs  and 
positively affected by an exogenous expansion of international income.  

Government consumption is typically exogenous and can be associated or not with household 

consumption or tax collection. Stocks accumulate following the variation of production.  

The specification of the recursive dynamic is based on the modeling of intertemporal behavior 
and  results  from  previous  periods  (backward  looking).  Current  economic  conditions,  such  as  the 
availability  of  capital,  are  endogenously  dependent  on  later  periods  but  remain  unaffected  by 
forward-looking  expectations.  Thus,  investment  and  capital  stock  follows  accumulation  mechanisms 
and  inter-sectoral  shifts  from  pre-established  rules  associated  with  the  depreciation  rate  and  rates  of 
return. Moreover, it assumes a dampening of the investment responses. The labor market also presents 
an  intertemporal  adjustment  process  involving  three  variables:  real  wages,  current  employment,  and 
employment trends.  

On the supply side, a constant elasticity of transformation (CET) function is used to define the 
output of a given sector as a revenue-maximizing aggregate of goods for the domestic market and goods 
for the foreign markets.  

 

2.1.3 Environmental module 

 
In  the  model  of  core  specifications,  previously  reported,  the  BeGreen  model  has  an 
environmental  module  inspired  by  the  MMRF-Green  model  (Adams  et  al.,  2002).  The  model  treats 
emissions  in  detail,  separating  them  by  issuing  agent  (fuel,  industries  and  households),  and  issuing 
activity. Emissions in the model are associated with the use of fuel (twelve fuels in total) or the level of 
sector activity, such as agricultural emissions (whose cause lies in the enteric fermentation of ruminants, 
rice cultivation and use of fertilizers especially, an important source of Brazilian emissions) or industrial 
processes  (e.g.  cement  manufacture).  The  model  calculates  the  carbon  price  or  cost  of  emission 
reductions  by  imposing  GHG  emission  targets  endogenously.  This  module  is  responsible  for  the 
transformation of these prices or  carbon taxes on ad-valorem rates,  feeding the core model. From the 
results  of  certain  variables  (fuel  use  by  sectors,  level  of  activity  and  household  consumption),  the 
environmental  module  calculates  changes  in  emissions.  Emissions  are  measured  in  terms  of  carbon 
dioxide equivalents (CO2-e). 

According to Adams et al. (2002), government revenue from the imposition of a carbon tax, R, 

can be calculated as: 

                                                                                                        (1) 

where τ is a specific tax on a ton of CO2-e and E is the amount (in tonnes) of CO2-e by emission 
source f (fossil fuels or productive activity) and by user u (industries and households). Since the tax on 
CO2-e emissions will be determined through an ad-valorem tax rate on fuel use or production activity, R 
is equivalent to: 

                                                                                                 (2) 

 

28 

,fufuRE,,100fuffufutRPQWhere 

  is  the  ad  valorem  tax  rate  ( %),

is  the  basic  unit  price  of  fuel  or  carbon-content 

product and 

is the amount of fuel or product consumed by user u. For each type of emission source 

and user, a specific tax on emissions can be translated into an ad valorem rate as follows: 

                                                                                                       (3) 

The last part of the equation, 

can be defined as the emission intensity for fuel use or 

level of productive activity by Brazilian currency (Reais). To determine the carbon price, marginal cost 
of  emissions  (or  carbon  tax),  the  impact  on  the  ad  valorem  tax  rate  for  each  type  of  emission  source 
depends  not  only  on  technical  features,  such  as  the  carbon  content  of  each  source  but  also  economic 
variables or market conditions such as price. 

Emissions  from  fuel  use  are  modeled  proportionally  to  use  and  activity  emissions  for  the 
product-related industries. The producer’s cost function is modified to include the carbon taxes so that 
they induce a substitution in favor of lower carbon-content fossil fuels or products.  

Another important mechanism of the model is the possibility of returning the revenue from taxes 
through  income  compensation  or  an  allowance  (negative  tax)  on  household  purchases.  This  process, 
however, is specified to allow only a certain portion of revenue to be compensated. Therefore, there is 
the possibility of both total revenue return (100 % return), and the return at an intermediate level. 

In  this  stage,  there  are  no  endogenous  technological  innovations  in  the  case  of  fossil  fuels  or 
productive activities (less emission-intensive technologies) that allow, for example, the burning of coal 
to  release  less  CO2  per  ton  used.  Many  of  these  abatement  technologies  or  alternative  production 
methods would become cost effective under increasing carbon tax rates. However, appropriate values of 
the parameters of the abatement response functions need to be firmly established, and in the Brazilian 
case there is still a lot of uncertainty. We do not do so here because of lack of information. This is a 
topic for future work5.  
 
2.1.4 Equilibrium conditions and closure rules 

 
The  market  equilibrium  conditions  of  BeGreen  is  characterized by  an  allocation of  goods  and 
factors in such a way that (i) the endogenously determined prices clear all markets, ii) all agents respect 
their  budget  constraint,  and  iii)  the  total  level  of  CO2  emissions  meets  the  specified  reduction  target. 
Supply–demand balances for all commodities and nonfixed factors clear through adjustment in prices in 
frictionless markets. The model is Walrasian in character, and hence, it determines only relative prices. 
The  nominal  exchange  rate  is  chosen  to  be  the  numéraire.  The  major  macroeconomic  variables  are 
endogenous  in  the  policy  scenario  (real  government  expenditure  is  exogenous).  In  CGE  recursive 
dynamic models, investment increases cause reductions in the expected rates of return, via an increase in 
capital stock, later reducing these investments to its steady state (equilibrium). On the other hand, real 
wages  will  respond  to  employment  increases  until  the  balance  of  the  labor  market  is  reestablished. 
BeGreen is a one country model with exogenous international trade structures. So, Brazil is modelled as 
a  small  open  economy.  There  is  free  movement  of  goods  and  factors  within  the  Brazilian  economy 
sectors. 

In the simulations, the constraint on total emissions is binding (exogenous), the equilibrium  of 
carbon price (or abatement marginal cost) is endogenously determined by the model. In “cap-and-trade” 
simulations, the model allows sectors to trade permissions between themselves according to established

2.1.4 Model Database e Parameters 
 
 
The  core  database  was  built  based  on  the  Input-Output  Matrix  of  2005  from  the  Brazilian 
Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics  (IBGE),  foreign  trade  by  sector  and  trade  port,  available  and 
household consumption by product from Household Budget Survey (POF) from IBGE.  Emissions of 
CO2-e are another important source of model information. Table 1 summarizes the BeGreen emissions 
data,  which  are  based  on  information  from  the  Brazilian  Energy  Balance  and  Emissions  National 
Inventory, indicating a volume of 882 018 Gg CO2-e6 in 2005.  

The emission from the use of fuels account for 37 % of all emissions, while the other 63 % 
are associated with productive activity sectors. Livestock and Fisheries, Agriculture and Other are 
the  sectors  that  account  for  the  largest  sources  of  emissions  in  this  category;  of  these,  livestock 
alone accounted for 60 % of emissions from production activities in Brazil.

Sets of parameters have to be estimated or borrowed from literature. Because of the lack of 
data  to  estimate  and  econometric  literature  references,  the  values  for  energy  elasticities  were 
determined  moderately.  The  elasticity  substitution  between  energy  composite  was  set  to  be  0.5. 
Elasticity  of  substitution  between  alcohol  and  gasoline  is  set  to  1,  given  the  increasing  in  the 
number  of  vehicles  with  "flex-fuel"  technology  in  Brazil.  Finally,  the  elasticities  of  substitution 
between technologies in technology bundle sectors were based on the study of Li  et al. (2000) and 

                                                      
6 Emission factors were needed to process the emissions in a common unit, CO2 equivalent (CO2-e), obtained from the 
Stern Review (Stern, 2006), from the estimates of Global Warming Potential (GWP).

adapted  to  the  reality  of  the  Brazilian  energy  matrix.  The  sensitivity  analysis  performed  on  the 
parameters  and  elasticities  revealed  that  the  results,  considering  the  methodological  specification,  are 
robust for most variables7. 

Some  database  indicators  can  be  calculated  in  order  to  show  how  the  GHG  emissions  are 
associated with industrial sectors.  For each sector,  the  activity  emissions and fuel  use emissions were 
summed.  Table  2  calculates  the  ratio  between  emissions  per  Gross  Value  of  Production  (GVP),  the 
exports coefficient (Exports/GVP) and the multiplier of emissions. This multiplier should be interpreted 
as  the  increase  in  emission  in  the  economy  (in  Gg)  for  each  R$  1  million  increase  in  final  demand 
production of the sector, taking into account both direct and indirect emissions. 

Table 2 indicates the heterogeneous structure of emissions in the industrial sectors. Cement has 
high  direct  emission  coefficient  and  multiplier  effect.  Food  and  Beverage  has  low  direct  emission 
coefficient, but it has a high multiplier effect of emission, due to the agriculture and livestock supplies 
that it acquires. Some sectors with higher participation in exports have high emissions multiplier effect 
(steel and derivatives, iron ore and equipment)

2.1 Control policies simulations (CAP) and Market simulations (CAP-AND-TRADE) 
 

In  this  section,  the  procedures  used  in  the  GHG  mitigating  policies  simulations  over  the 
Brazilian  industrial  sector  are  reported.  Two  different  policies  are  considered:  1)  imposition  of  a 
common emissions control policy to the selected sectors (CAP) and 2) a carbon market policy (CAP-
AND-TRADE) over the selected sectors, inspired by the Sectoral Plan of Industry Mitigation.  

At  first,  a  baseline  scenario  is  set  for  the  growth  of  the  Brazilian  economy,  in  the  absence  of 
such policies. The baseline scenario is set as a trend scenario of the economy where deviations related to 
it  can  be  measured,  estimating  the  effects  of  specific  policies.  This  scenario  represents  a  growth 
trajectory of the Brazilian economy between 2006 and 2030, as well as the trajectory of the total and 
sectoral  emissions  that  would  take  place  if  there  were  no  control  policy  and/nor  carbon  market.  The 
evolution  of  the  economy  in  the  2006-2030  period  is  based  on  oficial  macroeconomic  data  and 
emissions  observed  2006  and  2011.  The  scenario  also  incorporates  information  about  the  increase  of 
energy efficiency based on EPE (Brazillian official Energy Research Institute) projections. 

The  baseline  scenario  is  characterized  by  an  average  rate  of  4.0 %  growth  in  the  Brazilian 
GDP  per  year  from  2005  to  2030.  In  this  scenario,  the  emissions  grow  on  average  3.0 %, 
highlighting  the  growth  of  emissions  from  energy  use  –fuels  (3.4 %  per  year)  and  industrial 
processes  (4.0 %  per  year).  Hence,  we  observe  a  growth  acceleration  of  the  industrial  processes 
emissions and an increase in its participation in the total emissions, as well as a slower increase of 
agricultural emissions, with consequent loss of participation in total emissions. 

The  difference  between  the  trajectories  of  the  baseline  scenario  and  the  policy  scenario 
represents  the  effect  of  the  simulated  GHG  mitigation  policies.  In  each  scenario,  the  policy  starts  in 
2016.  New  linked  simulations,  year  by  year,  allow  us  to  analyze  the  results  up  to  2030,  based  on 
accumulated deviation in relation to the baseline scenario.

Having  as  motivation  the  goals  and  sectors  included  in  the  Sectoral  Plan  for  Industry 
Mitigation8, two policy scenarios were  created, summarized in  Chart 1.  The first one  (Scenario  I) 
refers to the policy where it would establish, in 2016, a standard mandatory emissions reduction for 
the  selected  industrial  sectors.  These  sectors  are  the  most  representative  regarding  the  GHG 
emissions,  and  they  correspond  to  23 %  of  the  sectoral  emissions  in  Brazil  in  2005,  according  to 
Table 3. The policy would have two phases: 2016 to 2020 and 2021 to 2030. In the first phase, the 
goal  would  be  a  reduction  in  relation  to  the  baseline  scenario  of  5 %  of  the  projected  emissions9 
between 2016-2020 for the sectors of Cement, Other non-metallic mineral products (lime), cellulose 
and  paper,  no-ferrous  metals  (aluminum)  and  steel  manufacturing  and  derivatives  (pig  iron  and 
steel). Then, in the second phase (2021-2030), that goal would be a decrease of 10 % compared to 
the baseline scenario, incorporating the sectors of chemical products, petroleum refining and natural 
gas. 

The  second  scenario  (Scenario  II)  would  represent  an  emission  reduction  policy  with  the 
same goals, phases and sectors of the previous policy, but with the establishment of a carbon market 
for industrial sectors, like the EU-ETS. The permissions distribution would be 100 % free, allocated 
among  the  sectors,  according  to  their  participation  in  the  total  sectors  emissions  in  the  carbon 
market.

3. Sectoral impacts of mitigation policies 
 

 
It is expected that the simulated policies would increase production costs over the industrial 
activity and the economy as a whole. In general, the main effect of imposition policies of emission 
restriction over the included sectors is the increase of the cost of carbon intensive industrial goods, 
shifting the marginal cost curves upwards. Intuitively, the extent of this effect will vary according to 
the  participation  of  energy  or  carbon  in  the  production,  implying  that  large  energy  and  fuel  users 
will  be  the  most  intensively  affected.  The  same  can  be  said  regarding  the  goods  produced  by  the 
carbon-intensive productive sectors, such as chemical products, iron and steel. 

The linking and interdependence of the different sectors of economy, reflected in the use of 
inputs  in  the  production  process  is  a  determinant  element  in  elucidating  the  sectoral  impacts. 
Although  the  input-output  structure  is  crucial  for  the  results,  it  is  just  the  starting  point  to 
understand the effect of the emission policies over economy. Another important factor is the degree 
of  substitutability  between  the  different  energy  sources  (renewable,  non-renewable)  and  the  fuels 
use. This  factor influences the magnitude over which the increase of cost of intensive products  in 
carbon  is  transferred  to  the  sectoral  production  costs.  It  also  includes  the  effect  caused  by  the 
displacement  of  productive  factors  that  influence  sectoral  performance.  Taking  into  account  these 
determinants, Table 4 shows the impacts of the two scenarios over the level of sectoral activity.

Once  again  it’s  worth  emphasizing  that  the  sectors  have  positive  growth  in  the  baseline 
scenario,  so  the  negative  impact  results  shown  in  the  table  are  relative  reductions  to  this  scenario 
and, because of that, they shouldn’t be read as absolute decreases in the activity level. The impact of 
the policies is very different between sectors. The most direct impact over the activity level happens 
in  the  industrial  sectors  taking  part  of  the  policies.  Steel  manufacture  and  derivatives,  cement,  oil 
refining,  oil  and  gas,  other  non-metallic  products,  chemical  products,  cellulose  and  paper  have 
larger decreases in production. 

The increase of costs in the carbon-intensive sectors and in its consequent investment drop 
can  elucidate  these  results.  The  results  are  also  heterogeneous  when  comparing  CAP  and 
CAP-AND-TRADE scenarios. Sectors such as cement, oil and gas and oil refining would have less 
intense  losses  due  to  the  carbon  market  policy.  On  the  other  hand,  sectors  such  as  steel 
manufacturing and derivatives and chemical products have more pronounced drops with the carbon 
market than the emissions limit without trading. These results will be more detailed later on, where 
the results of sectoral costs and trade permissions between sectors are shown. 

Indirectly,  via  interconnections  of  the  productive  chain,  other  sectors  are  also  affected 
negatively, due to the decline in production of the interlinked sectors. In this case, sectors such as 
automobiles  and  utilities,  machinery  and  equipment,  trucks  and  buses  and  appliances  are  good 
examples.  Light  manufacturing  sectors  (Food  and  beverages,  textiles,  clothing,  leather  and 
footwear)  are  not  affected  by  the  policy  and  even  present  growth  in  the  activity  level  in  both 
scenarios.

In fact, the sectors’ production costs increase, as they need to take into account the cost of 
 
GHG emission and that impacts the production level in each sector. As it can be seen in the table, 
the emission limit (CAP) imposes meaningful production costs for the selected industrial sectors in 
the policies, especially on steel manufacturing and derivatives and cement. In the case of the cement 
sector, a net  permissions  purchaser (this  result will be shown later on), it is  less expensive to  buy 
emissions  in  the  carbon  market  than  facing  with  emissions  abatement  costs  in  a  CAP  scenario 
without  commercialization.  This  way,  for  sectors  with  marginal  cost  curve  in  higher  emission 
reductions,  participation  in  a  carbon  market  could  be  beneficial  compared  to  the  imposition  of  a 
standard or emission reduction limit. Besides the cement sector, oil and gas, oil refining and other 
non-metallic products are included in this category. 
          This result shows the importance of sectoral considerations and the design of mechanisms in 
the formulation of mitigation policies. The CAP scenario makes productions costs more expensive 
for  important  sectors  in  the  investment  composition  (cement,  steel,  non-metallic)  and  relatively 
benefits  consumer  goods  sectors  (textiles,  clothing  and  footwear).  The  higher  cost  of  investments 
weakens  growth  possibilities  in  the  economy  and  capital  accumulation.  The  CAP-AND-TRADE 
scenario can achieve the same emission reduction goals with less adverse effects. 

The carbon market results on industrial sectors (scenario II) can be better analyzed in Table 
6.  We  can  see  the  emission  reduction  by  sector  in  each  phase,  emissions  and  permissions  in 
diagrams of CO2-e and the sectors permit trading. The last two columns are related to the revenue 
with the permission trading and its participation over the production value for each sector in the end 
of each phase. 

Given  a  carbon  price,  set  by  CAP  in  all  sectors,  the  sector  maximizes  its  production 
choosing how much it is going to reduce its emissions. That reduction depends on that price and the 
emissions abatement marginal cost in the sector (which is related to the production function, inputs 
use,  emissions,  among  other  factors).  If  the  sector  will  be  a  permission  seller  that  means  its 
abatement cost is lower, vis-à-vis a buyer whose reductions cost would be higher.  

In  the  first  phase  of  the  policy  (2016-2020),  for  example,  steel  manufacturing  and 
derivatives, followed by cement, would be the sectors set as permission buyers. That indicates that 

 

28 

the abatement  marginal cost  for these sectors is higher than the price of  carbon market,  making it 
more efficient to buy permissions, reducing the emissions under the set goal. The opposite is valid 
for cellulose and paper, other non-metallic mineral products and non-ferrous metals. 
An interesting result is, in the second phase of the policy, with an extension of the market to 
 
more than three sectors, that steel manufacturing and derivatives would turn out to be a permissions 
net seller. That suggests that with the entrance of sectors with higher abatement costs (oil and gas, 
oil refining), and consequently, higher carbon prices, abatement cost for the sectors becomes lower 
than the permissions price in the market. 
 
Regarding  the  revenue  (or  expenses)  coming  from  permissions  sale  and  purchase  in  the 
carbon  market  in  general,  the  results  point  out  that  their  participation  on  the  sectoral  production 
value are relatively low, indicating that the permissions sale or purchase has a marginal effect over 
the sectors production decisions.

Impacts of mitigation policies:  macroeconomic effects 

3.1 
 

A  way  to  assess  the  mitigation  policies  cost  is  to  analyze  the  production  losses,  consumption, 
exports and investments, since imposing targets to the emissions and carbon markets imply an adjustment 
of  the  economy  towards  inputs  reallocation  and  productive  processes.  As  the  sectoral  production 
technology  is  given  (no  technological  progress  occurs  due  to  the  policy)  necessarily  the  mitigation 
policies  increase  production  costs  in  the  economy,  despite  certain  capacity  of  the  sectors  to  reallocate 
inputs and productive factors.  

Table 7 shows the aggregated results of emissions indicators for the policy scenarios I and II. The 
numbers  represent  a  cumulated  percentage  deviation  (from  2016  to  2030)  relative  to  the  baseline 
scenario. The real GDP reduction over all scenarios is not surprising. A control policy over emissions in 
the  most  relevant  industrial  sectors  in  terms  of  emissions,  for  instance,  could  result  in  a  cumulative 
decrease of GDP in relation to the baseline scenario  of -1,06 % in 2030. It is worth reminding that this 
result represents a reduction related to the baseline scenario in 2030; therefore, it is not an absolute drop 
of GDP. In other words, that means that the GDP growth would go from 4.00 % per year to nearly 3.92 % 
on average by 2030, considering the emission policy. 

However,  if  the  emission  target  is  reached  via  carbon  market  among  sectors,  the  costs  on  GDP 
terms  would  be  lower.  In  that  case,  the  GDP  would  present  a  -0.9 %  cumulative  reduction  in  2030,  a 
reduction with an impact of 0.12 percentage points, which would be equivalent to R$ 270 billion. That is 
an important result, derived from the highest efficiency of the carbon market, according to literature. In 
that way, there is a gain of economic efficiency when the carbon market is established.  
 
Table  7  -  Macroeconomic impacts of a emission limits (CAP) and emission limits via carbon market 
(CAP-AND-TRADE)  over  Brazilian  economy  -  2016  to  2030  (cumulative  percentage  deviation  in 
relation to the baseline scenario in 2030) 

 Source: own elaboration based on the simulation results with the BeGreen model. 

 

 
The GDP drop in both scenarios is associated with household consumption behavior, investment and 
exports.  Reduction  in  household  consumption  is  a  result  of  the  negative  income  effect,  because  of  the 
economic  activity  drop.  The  investment  reduction  is  linked  to  the  investment  costs  increase  and  the  lower 
need  for  capital  expansion.  This  result  can  be  related  to  the  decline  in  the  profitability  of  primary  factors,

It is reasonable to have the profitability drop of primary factors as an effect, because 
of the reduction in the demand for those factors caused by the reduction of the economic activity10. Declines 
in primary factors profitability indicate that the incidence of carbon pricing is not integrally passed to the final 
consumers,  being  partially  absorbed  by the  factors prices.  The table shows  that  the investment  reduction is 
better in the carbon market scenario, given the higher efficiency of this scenario over the sectors participating 
in the market. 

Exports  would  also  present  a  negative  impact  because  of  the  loss  of  competitiveness  of  national 
products. That drop is caused by the effect of price, due to the increase in production costs, since exports vary 
inversely to domestic prices. In the case of imports, results show a cumulative drop in 2030. With economic 
activity drop over the years, there is a reduction in domestic prices, which, along with the simultaneous drop 
in GDP, implies reduction in imports. However, since imports reduce less than GDP, there is a substitution of 
domestic goods for imported ones, even though this effect is small. 

Regarding total emissions (Table 7), there is a percent decrease in both scenarios of around 3.5 times 
the  GDP  reduction.  The  impact  on  emissions  would  be  around  -3.87 %  and  -3.66 %,  respectively,  for 
scenarios I and II. However, sectoral reductions are heterogeneous. Emissions linked to industrial sectors are 
the  ones  with  greatest  reduction  because  they  are  the  target  sectors  for  both  scenarios.  The  sectors  of 
agriculture and electric power generation and distribution have elevated emissions, which features a carbon 
leakage effect (emission leakage). The trajectory of emissions over the entire period of the two policies (2016-
2030) can be seen in Figure 3, as well as the carbon price behavior in the Cap-and-Trade Scenario. 
Even though the difference in emissions reduction between the scenarios is small, we can observe 
 
that the trajectories are different in the second phase of the carbon policies, when reduction goal increases 
from 5 % to 10 %. From that point, the CAP scenario reduction is marginally higher than the CAP-AND-
TRADE scenario reduction.

in CAP-AND-TRADE scenario

The carbon price in the market of the  CAP-AND-TRADE policy is an indicator of the marginal 
cost of emissions reduction in all the sectors. Progressive targets of emission reductions until 2030 imply 
a growing escalation of carbon prices when there is trade via permissions carbon market. The expansion 
of sectors in phase II implies a certain inflexion of the carbon price since 2021, suggesting an increase in 
marginal costs in emissions reduction with an expansion in industrial sectors and also the target of goals 
reduction.  The  prices  started  as  R$  50  per  CO2-eq  ton.  and  can  reach  R$  338  in  2030,  given  more 
ambitious emission reduction goals and the sectors participation with higher emission abatement cost. It 
is worthy of note that these higher carbon prices are justified by the fact of encompassing only industrial 
sectors, not including agriculture and livestock that would tend to reduce considerably the carbon price in 
the market, given its lower reduction cost. 

                                                      
10 Land profitability decreases more sharply, due to the simulation hypothesis in which the land supply is fixed.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
 
This paper intended to contribute to the studies of GHG emission reduction policies in Brazil. The 
focus  is  on  policies  with  market  mechanisms,  which  are  believed  to  have  the  lowest  costs  of  GHG 
emissions  reductions.  Since  GHG  emissions  in  Brazil  are  greatly  focused  in  the  use  of  energy  (fossil 
fuels)  and  in  industrial  activity,  as  shown  by  2010  emissions  data,  it  becomes  important  to  study  the 
impact of the mitigation policies on the industry. 

A  recent  (2012)  Brazilian  industrial  policy  has  proposed  cleaner  production  goals,  implying  energy 
efficiency  (less  energy  per  unit  of  product),  which  direct  and  indirectly  goes  in  the  same  way  as  the  GHG 
emission reduction. These incentives can increase the impact of emission reduction or carbon market policies, 
because  they  tend  to  encourage  innovation  and  efficiency  in  the  use  of  GHG  emmiting  fuels.  The  results 
presented in our simulations  can help  unveil the industrial sectors where technological innovation  aimed  at 
reducing emissions should be addressed, such as cement, steelworks, non-metallic products, oil refining and 
chemical.  

The  carbon  market  estimations  showed  to  be  cost-effective:  it  achieved  the  same  emission 
reduction with a lower cost of economic activity loss. In monetary  terms, related to the goal imposition 
policy  without  trade,  the  carbon  market  would  avoid  the  loss  of  R$270  billion  in  economic  activity 
between 2016 and 2030, equivalent to 6.2 % of the Brazilian GDP in 2012.
