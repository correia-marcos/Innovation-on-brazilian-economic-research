ABSTRACT 

This  paper  analyzes  the  economic  impacts  of  productivity  gains  in  the  Brazilian  agriculture  to  reduce 
deforestation and domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as proposed by Borlaug Hypothesis. For this, 
it  was  used  a  Computable  General  Equilibrium  (CGE)  model,  tailored  to  include  a  module  of  land-use 
change and GHG emissions. The simulations were carried out through three policies, whose shocks were 
applied on livestock, agriculture, and both sectors aggregately. The results show that productivity gains can 
effectively  “save”  land  and  thus  avoid  the  deforestation  of  areas  of  native  vegetation,  as  established  by 
Borlaug Hypothesis. In addition, the policies promoted the reduction of GHG emissions, especially in the 
Amazon and Cerrado biomes, with no adverse effects on the Brazilian economy and has improved income 
distribution reducing price goods to low income households. Finally, this research constitutes a step forward 
in  the  study  of  land-use  change  and  its  integration  to  GHG  emissions  into  a  CGE  model  framework, 
showing  the  role  of  productivity  as  an  alternative  for  reducing  deforestation  and  increasing,  or  at  least, 
preserving agricultural production. However, productivity gains, albeit effective in reducing emissions and 
deforestation, may have lower effects if they are not combined with other policies.

RESUMO 

Este artigo analisa os impactos econômicos de ganhos de produtividade na agricultura brasileira, tendo em 
vista a redução do desmatamento e das  emissões domésticas de gases de efeito estufa (GEE), conforme 
proposto pela Hipótese de Borlaug. Para isso, utiliza-se um modelo de equilíbrio geral computável (EGC), 
adaptado com um módulo de mudanças do uso da terra e emissões de GEE. As simulações foram realizadas 
através de três políticas, cujos choques foram aplicados sobre a pecuária, agricultura e em ambos os setores 
de  forma  agregada.  Os  resultados  mostram  que  ganhos  de  produtividade  podem  efetivamente  “poupar” 
terras  e,  portanto,  evitar  desmatamento,  como  indicado  pela  Hipótese  de  Borlaug.  Ainda,  as  políticas 
promoveram a redução das emissões domésticas de GEE, especialmente nos Biomas Amazônia e Cerrado, 
sem  gerar  efeitos  adversos  sobre  a  economia  brasileira  e  contribuíram  para  uma  melhor  distribuição  de 
renda, ao reduzir os preços  dos bens às famílias de menor renda. Assim, este trabalho contribuiu com o 
estudo das mudanças no uso da terra e sua integração às emissões de GEE, no arcabouço dos modelos EGC, 
ao evidenciar o papel da produtividade como alternativa para redução do desmatamento e aumento, ou pelo 
menos, manutenção dos níveis de produção agrícola. Contudo, ganhos de produtividade, embora efetivos 
na  redução  de  emissões  e  do  desmatamento,  podem  ter  seus  efeitos  reduzidos  se  esses  não  forem 
combinados com outras políticas.

1 Introduction 

Brazil has emerged as a major agricultural producer in the international scenario. Such recognition 
stems from its agricultural dynamism, which has been a key strength of its economy. From 1994 to 2011, 
for example, the average share of agriculture in GDP was 24.6 percent, which when disaggregated shows

that agriculture alone accounted for 17.1 percent, while livestock accounted for 7.1 percent, over the same 
period (CEPEA, 2014). 

The positive performance of the agricultural sector led to a positive balance of trade for Brazil. 
Over the past 20 years, agribusiness accounted, on average, for 40.4 percent of all its exports. This result is 
in sharp contrast with the weak performance of other export sectors, particularly industrial sectors. In 2013, 
for example, the Brazilian trade balance amounted to US$ 2.6 billion, while the balance of agribusiness 
totaled US$ 82.9 billion, showing the importance of this sector to the country’s economy (BRASIL, 2014).  
Agriculture  also  has  a  bearing  on  the  well-being  of  the  population  due  to  variations  in  its 
purchasing power. In Brazil, such variations are mainly captured by the IPCA, which is a price index that 
measures  the  official  inflation  in  the  country.  Almost  22  percent  of  this  index  is  made  up  of  food  and 
beverage items, which are subject to crop fluctuations that affect domestic prices (IBGE, 2012). 

Agricultural expansion is, therefore, a key element for expanding the national economy, especially 
on  a  stable  basis.  Over  decades,  such  expansion  has  been  based  on  land  incorporation.  Between  the 
Brazilian Agricultural Censuses of 1995/96 and 2006, for example, the total area occupied by crops grew 
by 20 percent, from 50.1 million hectares (Mha) to 59.8 Mha, while planted pasture areas grew from 99.6 
Mha to 101.4 Mha over the same period (IBGE, 2014a). 

In a regional  context,  crops areas  grew mainly  in the mid-west  (+63.9%), north  (+37.3%),  and 
northeast  (+29%)  regions  of  Brazil.  Livestock,  in  turn,  grew  only  in  the  north  (+39.3%)  and  northeast 
(+26.9%)  regions.  The  latter  regions  and  the  mid-west  stood  out  in  reducing  native  vegetation  areas  in 
agricultural establishments by -23.6%, -8.1%, and -9.6%, respectively (IBGE, 2014a). 

Presently, the agricultural sector faces the challenge of continuing to grow at the same pace in a 
scenario of land supply constraints. Such restriction refers to the conversion of native vegetation areas for 
other  uses,  especially  in  the  Amazon  and  Cerrado  biomes,  located  in  regions  where  agriculture  has 
expanded over recent decades – the north, northeast and mid-west regions of Brazil. 

The  difficulties  imposed  on  land  clearing  for  cattle  farming  and  crops  in  Brazil’s  center-north 
resulted from national efforts to reduce deforestation in the Cerrado and Amazon biomes with the aim of 
reducing domestic GHG emissions, causing productivity gains to emerge as important alternative for the 
Brazilian agriculture growth. Conversely, productivity increases in agriculture would allow production to 
grow without clearing new areas – the Borlaug effect (BORLAUG, 2002).  

This article has as objective to analyze the economic impacts of productivity gains in the Brazilian 
agriculture. Besides, policy effects on land allocation and GHG emissions were also evaluated, through a 
CGE model tailored for the Brazilian economy with a land-use module that captures heterogeneity related 
to different land types and biomes. 

This  study  is  organized  in  four  sections,  besides  this  introduction.  The  first  one  analyzes  the 
evolution of agricultural productivity in Brazil. The second one presents the methodology and the empiric 
strategy of this study. In the third one the results are discussed. The last one presents the final remarks. 

 

2 Agricultural productivity in Brazil  

Productivity is  a recurrent  issue in  economics due to  its implications for  economic  growth and 
development, as well as for the well-being of the population. Food security and deforestation, therefore, are 
important issues underlying increases in agricultural productivity. Borlaug (2002) stated that if the yield of 
grain  production in  1950 had  remained at the same level  in 2000,  around 1.2 billion hectares would  be 
necessary to ensure the same production level in the latter period, against the 660 million hectares being 
used nowadays. This relation between increases in agricultural productivity and a decreasing demand for 
new land is referred to as the “Borlaug Hypothesis”. 

Following  Borlaug’s  argument,  Stevenson  et  al.  (2011)  analyzed  the  impacts  of  adopting  new 
technologies in connection with land-use change, focusing on Brazil and Indonesia. The Brazilian case was 
evaluated using a CGE model that considers the effects of increases in productivity in soybean crops. The 
results support the Borlaug Hypothesis, as productivity gains reduced the area occupied by soybean crops 
by  300,000  hectares,  at  the  same  time  that  it  increased  forest  and  pasture  areas  by  0.1%  and  0.13  %, 
respectively.

Gasques et al. (2012) also analyzed the effects of several policies on the productivity of Brazilian 
agriculture.  In  that  study,  the  total  factor  productivity  (TFP)  index  was  estimated,  revealing  a  high 
productivity growth rate in domestic agriculture, which grew by 5.69 percent in the 2000-2011 period.  That 
index is justified by lower subsidies being granted to the sector and its increasing efficiency, which place 
Brazil  in  the  group  of  countries  with  the  highest  productivity  growth  rate  in  agriculture,  supporting  the 
results of other studies, such as that by Fugile (2010). 

Martha  Jr.  et.  al.  (2012)  also  studied  productivity,  but  focusing  on  the  Brazilian  cattle  farming 
industry. In that study, the expansion observed in the agricultural frontier is associated with an increase in 
livestock production, especially in 1950-1975. Nonetheless, in the following period, the dynamism of the 
agricultural sector was associated with productivity gains, which amounted to about 3.6% and 6.6% per 
year  in  1975-1996  and  1996-2006,  respectively.  Finally,  the  authors  conclude  that  with  no  productivity 
gains  and  other  land  saving  actions,  such  as  investment  in  technology  and  in  improving  livestock,  the 
Brazilian livestock industry can only grow by incorporating new land. 

The  relative  consensus  around  increases  in  agricultural  productivity  in  Brazil  contrasts  with 
discussions on the magnitude of such increases. According to the OECD (2011), Brazil ranks first in the 
global ranking of agricultural productivity, which grew by 1.87% in 1961-2007 and 3.63% in 2000-2007. 
The growth recorded in developed countries amounted to only 1.48% and 0.86% over the same periods. 

The USDA (2014) also shows that Brazil is the country with the highest agricultural productivity 
growth, of 4.03%, followed by China, with a rate of 3.05% – both of which are higher than those registered 
in OECD countries. These developing and East European countries accounted for an average increase in 
the productivity of global agriculture from 1.65% in 1999-2000 to 1.84% in 2001-2009. 

The specialized literature, then, supports the argument that agricultural productivity is on the rise 
worldwide,  especially  in  developing  countries.  Thus,  Brazil  stands  out  for  its  high  productivity  growth, 
although  there  is  no  consensus  on  the  magnitude  of  such  growth.  As  a  result,  the  argument  for  using 
productivity gains to reconcile the trade-off between agriculture/livestock growth, deforestation, and GHG 
emissions, all of which are addressed in this article, is reinforced. 

 

3 Methodology 

This  article uses  a  computable  general equilibrium model of Brazil, TERM-BR, to  analyze the 
relation between productivity gains and land clearing. It is a multiregional and bottom-up model, tailored 
for regional  and interregional analyses whose structure uses national results as aggregations of regional 
results (HORRIDGE, 2012). 

The TERM-BR model has been applied mainly to study how specific policy shocks may affect 
Brazil, such as the economic impacts  of fiscal  policies (SANTOS, 2006), climate shocks on agriculture 
(MORAES, 2010), and the intensification of biofuel production and consumption (SANTOS, 2013), among 
others. The model was modified to cope with the goal of this study, including a land use module, following 
the advances made by Ferreira Filho and Horridge (2014). However, we took a step further and matched 
land-use changes to their GHG emissions.    

Finally, in this study there are 36 commodities and industries, 15 Brazilian regions and/or states, 
10  households  and  labor  grades,  and  2  margins  (trade  and  transport).    The  core  database  is  the  2005 
Brazilian  input-output  table,  presented  in  Ferreira  Filho  (2010).  Additionally,  the  model  includes  three 
dynamic-recursive  mechanisms:  (i)  a  flow-stock  relation  between  investment  and  capital  stock,  which 
assumes  a  one-year  gestation  lag;  (ii)  a  positive  relation  between  investment  and  profit  rate;  and  (iii)  a 
relation between wage increases and regional labor supply. These mechanisms as a whole allowed for a 
plausible base scenario for the future to be built. 
 
3.1 TERM-BR production structure 

In the TERM-BR production structure producers choose an optimal combination of primary and 
intermediary factors to minimize their costs subject to a production function whose structure is a composite 
of several “nested” Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) functions. 

Figure  1  shows  TERM-BR  production  structure,  which  is  organized  in  four  distinct  levels  and 
represents the production of several goods and services in the economy. At the top of the figure, quantities 
3 

 

of  final  goods  and  services  in  each  region  and  sector  are  determined  by  a  Constant  Elasticity  of 
Transformation  (CET) function, which induces production in  favor of goods whose relative prices have 
increased. 

At the next level, from top to bottom, intermediary goods (both domestic and imported goods) are 
combined with primary factors and taxes using a Leontief function, which combines the aforementioned 
elements in fixed proportions; in other words, primary factors and other inputs are complementary in the 
process of producing goods and services.

At  the  third  level,  composite  inputs  are  combined  through  a  CES  functions,  with  particular 
Armington’s  elasticities  of  substitution.  That  is,  goods  from  different  sources  are  considered  imperfect 
substitutes of each other. Still at the same level, primary factors (land, capital and labor) are also combined 
using a CES function, driven by an elasticity of substitution σprim.

types of skills and classifies them according to regional wages, a proxy for skills. Finally, at the last level 
other inputs are also represented by CES functions, which are a composite of domestic goods from several 
regions. 

3.2 Household demands 

 

Households  choose  the  optimal  consumption  bundles  by  maximizing  a  utility  function  of  the 
Klein-Rubin (or Stone-Geary) type, subject to a budget constraint. This utility function (Klein-Rubin) is 
often used in CGE models because it allows for subsistence and luxury goods to be disaggregated. With 
the maximization of the utility function, a demand equation system is generated that is referred to as Linear 
Expenditure System (LES). It describes each good as a linear function of total expenditure and of the prices 
of all goods, so the resulting equations are homogeneous of zero degree in prices and income. Figure 2 
shows consumption possibilities for households, considering the maximization of the Klein-Rubin utility 
function.

Regional  CGE  models  are  connected  by  the  trade  in  goods,  which  is  supported  by  large 
interregional trade matrices that register each commodity by region of origin and destination, transported 
values (related to domestic and imported goods), and margins associated with trade and transportation. 
 
3.3 Land-use changes and GHG emissions module  

Land  use  changes  and  forests  are  treated  endogenously  through  a  transition  matrix  approach, 
calibrated with data from the Brazilian Agricultural Censuses of 1995/96 and 2006. The transition matrix 
shows the land use dynamic in a specific region (r) at two points in time – an initial (i) and the final one (f). 
Table 1 shows four land use categories: crop (cr), pasture (pt), plantforest (pt), and unused (un). The last 
one represents all areas not being used for agricultural purposes, such as forests, grasslands, urban areas, 
rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, among others. In other words, the “unused” category represents areas of native 
vegetation and is used as a proxy for evaluating deforestation.

The elements of the main diagonal represent land use that remains under the same category, while 
the off-diagonal elements represent land conversion between the four land categories under consideration. 
For  example,  (𝑝𝑡, 𝑐𝑟)𝑖,𝑓   corresponds  to  the  amount  of  pastures  (pt)  in  the  initial  period  (i)  that  were 
converted into crops (cr) in the final period (f). Summing over the column (𝑇𝑂𝑇𝐴𝐿𝑓) gives the total for 
each category in the initial period, whilst summing over lines (𝑇𝑂𝑇𝐴𝐿𝑖) gives the total in the final period. 
The  transition  matrix  can  be  expressed  in  share  form,  as  in  Ferreira  Filho  and  Horridge  (2012,  2014) 
representing  Markov  probabilities,  which  are  modeled  as  a  function  of  land  rent  values,  as  shown  by 
Equation 1.  

 

𝛼 . 𝑀𝑞𝑟                                            (1) 
                𝑆𝑝𝑞𝑟 =   𝜇𝑝𝑟. 𝐿𝑝𝑞𝑟 . 𝑃𝑞𝑟
 
where (the r subscript denoting region/biome zones): 
𝑆𝑝𝑞𝑟 =  share of land type p that becomes type q in region/biome r  
𝜇𝑝𝑞 =   a slack variable, adjusted to ensure that ∑ 𝑆𝑝𝑞𝑟 = 1
; 
𝐿𝑝𝑞𝑟  = a constant of calibration = initial value of 𝑆𝑝𝑞𝑟 
𝑃𝑞𝑟
𝛼 = a sensitivity parameter, with value is set to 0.28 
𝑀𝑞𝑟 = a shift variable, initial value 1 
 

𝛼 = average unit rent earned by land type q 

𝑞

  The  sensibility  parameter  “α”  was  set  at  0.28  in  order  to  give  a  normal  representation  of 
deforestation in the historical period. If land rents in crop areas increase, the rate of conversion of pastures 
into crops will  also  increase. Furthermore, to  represent  the conversion rate of the  “Unused”  category,  a 
fictitious rent was employed based on a regional CPI (FERREIRA FILHO; HORRIDGE, 2014). 

Land use changes and forests, as well as their GHG emissions, were represented in the new version 
of the TERM-BR model using observed data. Such representation employs transition matrices as calibrated 
with satellite imagery provided by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research. 

The  new  transition  matrices  also  constitute  an  advance  in  relation  to  the  former  version  of  the 
model,  as  they  incorporate  a  new  dimension  into  the  TERM-BR  model,  the  Brazilian  biomes,  namely, 
Amazon (rainforest), Cerrado (savannah), Atlantic Forest (tropical forest), Pantanal (wetlands), Caatinga 
(semi-arid), and Pampa (grasslands), as show in Figure 3.

Figure 3 - Brazilian biomes. 

 

 
The biomes capture the heterogeneity associated with different types of soil, weather, and carbon 
content, similarly to the idea of the Agro Ecological Zones (AEZs) developed by the Global Trade Analysis 
Project (GTAP) 3. Besides, those differentials of soil, vegetation, and weather are accurately represented by 
biomes as compared to similar structures widely used for studying physical aspects of land use change. 

The new dimension, then, captures different GHG emissions associated with the same land use 
category,  but  in  distinct  biomes.  The  conversion  of  “Unused”  areas  (which  represent  areas  of  native 
vegetation) into pastures, for example, leads to the release of different amounts of carbon dioxide in the 
Amazon and Cerrado biomes. 

The new version of the TERM-BR model was developed in two stages with a module based on 
new information on land use and emissions. First, it was built from transition matrices by Brazilian biome 
and state. At this stage, it used satellite imagery, as noted before, which were disaggregated into polygons, 
biomes, municipalities, and GHG emissions for the whole country4. 

The  first  version  of  the  transition  matrices  follows  the  format  shown  in  the  Second  Brazilian 
Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions by Sources and Removals by Sinks of Greenhouse Gases (BRASIL, 
2010), with the exception of the regional dimension. At the second stage, the transition matrices built by 
state and biome were aggregated again under the CAT set, which considers 15 land use categories. Such 
categories were also aggregated in 4 broader categories, following model’ structure, which was done under 
the new set ALNDTYPE, as showed in Table 2.

The  number  of  land  use  categories  of  the  former  model  remains,  but  as  noted  before  a  new 
dimension  Biome  (Amazon,  Cerrado,  Caatinga,  Atlantic  Forest,  Pampa,  and  Pantanal)  was  created  to 
capture  the  heterogeneity  of  land  use  and  GHG  emissions  between  different  regions  (r)  of  the  country. 
Besides, land use change was traced to its GHG emissions and the transition matrices can be interpreted 
through a hypothetical example: 

  TRANS0  (“Non-managed  forest”,  “Pasture”,  “MtGrosso”,  “Amazon”)  =  100  hectares  of  non-
managed forests in the initial period converted into pasture in the final period in the Amazon Biome 
in Mato Grosso state; 

  EMIS0  (“Non-managed  forest”,  “Pasture”,  “MtGrosso”,  “Amazon”)  =  100  hectares  of  Non-
managed forest converted into Pastures in the state of Mato Grosso in the Amazon Biome emit 100 
gigagrams of  carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂ eq.);  

  YTRANS2 (“Unused”, “Crop”, “Bahia”, “Cerrado”) = 50 hectares of Unused areas in the initial 

period converted into crops in the Cerrado Biome of Bahia state.  

Figure  4  shows  the  data  flow  adopted  for  building  the  module  of  land  use  change  and  GHG 
emissions.  The  initial  area  matrix  (TRANS0),  after  being  aggregated  into  4  broad  categories,  was 
annualized (YTRAN) following the model’s temporal structure.

The RAS mathematical method was then applied to the resulting transition matrix to ensure that 
the totals matched the data from the Brazilian Agricultural Census. Thus, any area discrepancies between 
different data sources were solved.  Furthermore, all data were analyzed  using the GEMPACK software 
(HARRISON; PEARSON, 1996). As a result, the new transition matrices were assigned to GHG emissions, 
considering each land use category. Then, the emissions  by hectare ratio (EMISRATIO) was applied to 
area data (YTRANS2) and the amount of GHG was obtained for each land use category, according to the 
biome and region under consideration. Figure 5 shows the new land supply and demand structure in the 
model with the new dimension, biome, incorporated into it.

emissions endogenously emerged. Consequently, land (re)allocation was promoted through the four broad 
categories and transition matrices according to the biome and region, governed by a constant elasticity of 
transformation (CET) function. 

Table 3 shows GHG emissions distributed by biome and land use category. In the initial database, 
cattle farming is the main emitter of GHG in Brazil, especially in the Amazon and Cerrado regions, which 
is  a  major  indication  of  the  locus  of  domestic  emissions  and  of  key  activities  for  curbing  the  ongoing 
deforestation process in Brazil.

Therefore,  the  TERM-BR  model  can  analyze  patterns  of  occupation  of  the  Brazilian  territory 
considering the main economic activities in each sub-region and the expansion of the agricultural frontier, 
associating  them  to  GHG  emissions.  Furthermore,  the  model  can  indicate  alternatives  for  the  Brazilian 
agriculture in terms of reallocating economic activities with the aim of increasing agricultural production 
and reducing deforestation and GHG emissions. 

 

3.4 Scenarios 

The shocks implemented in this article take into account a number of stylized facts in the Brazilian 
economy, such as: (i) the lower productivity of livestock in the agricultural frontier as compared to other 
regions  of  the  country;  (ii)  the  high  productivity  of  Brazilian  agriculture,  especially  in  frontier  regions, 
where advanced production methods have been employed in crops such as soybean, cotton, among others. 
Productivity in livestock sector, then, still has room to increase at a faster rate than agriculture in Brazil. 
The shocks implemented are the following: 

  Policy 1: increasing primary livestock productivity by 2 percent over 6 years, 2015-2020, but only 

in agricultural frontier regions; 

  Policy 2: increasing primary agricultural productivity by 1.5 percent over 6 years, 2015-2020, in 

all regions; 

  Policy 3: the previous two policies together. 

In  both  cases,  the  effects  of  the  policies  are  permanent.  Besides,  the  effect  of  a  productivity 
increase  in  only  frontier  livestock  (Policy  1)  was  considered  separately  from  the  shock  on  agriculture 
(Policy 2) and then the two were aggregated under Policy 3. Through this procedure, we can identify if 
productivity gains in livestock alone are sufficient to curb the deforestation process, as well as to reduce 
GHG emissions. 

 

3.5 Model closure 
The model’s closure and main features are: 

  Real wage change drives the movement of labor between regions  and activities (but not between 

labor categories). Total labor supply increases, according to official projections by IBGE. 

  Capital accumulates between periods following the dynamic investment rule. Furthermore, capital 

stock is updated through the new capital price, e.g. the start-of-period price. 

  Regional consumption follows labor income. Moreover, regional real government spending demand 

follows regional real household demand. 

  The domestic GDP price index is chosen as the numeraire. Other prices should thus be interpreted 

as relative to the GDP price index. 

11 

 

  The national balance of trade is fixed as a percentage of real GDP.  
  We  divided  the  regions  of  the  model  into  two  groups:  Land-constrained  (LndUsed,  where 
agricultural  land  is  consolidated)  and  Frontier  (region  where  land  is  available  for  expanding 
agriculture), as shown in Figure 6. Regions where deforestation is on the rise can be separated and 
specific policies applied to them.

4 Results 

Table  4  shows  the  results  of  the  main  macroeconomic  variables  cumulated  in  2005-2035.  As 
expected, the productivity increase in agriculture was positive for the Brazilian economy, once it boosted 
the country’s growth by up to 0.51 percent in the broader scenario, which considers productivity gains both 
in agriculture and livestock (Policy 3).

The scenario of productivity gains only in livestock in the frontier region (Policy 1) also generated 
positive  results,  highlighting  the  influence  of  that  activity  on  the  Brazilian  economy.  In  this  case,  GDP 
increased  by  0.11%,  affecting  other  major  variables  such  as  household  consumption  (+0.08%)  and 
government spending (+ 0.08%). Thus, all policies led to an increase in investment due to a reduction in 
the price of capital,  whose effects  on the  capital  stock only began to  be  felt in  the post-2021 period, as 
capital is a rigid variable in the short run. 

In productive terms, the policies boosted agricultural output, as expected. Policy 1, for example, 
benefited  production  in  other  regions  of  Brazil  (LndUsed),  notably  when  rice  and  cotton  crops  are 

12 

 

considered, as shown in Table 5. It is also worth mentioning that cattle farming shifted to frontier regions 
(+8.9%), which may explain the increase observed in crops in non-frontier regions as a result of more land 
becoming available.

Thus, under policies 1 and 3, the shift of cattle farming to frontier regions and the growth of crops 
in traditional agricultural regions were boosted, as noted before. Such movements were enhanced by an 
increase  in  agricultural  productivity  in  the  rest  of  the  country  (LndUsed),  as  indicated  by  the  results  of 
policies  2  and  3.  These  policies  reinforce  the  role  of  the  agricultural  frontier  as  a  productive  hub,  as 
indicated by the growth of meat cattle (+10.1%) and of agriculture as a whole, in this case represented by 
an increase in the production of soybean (+9.8%) and corn (+4.4%). 

Prices were also affected by the policies, as shown in Figure 7. It presents the results of Policy 3, 

the broadest one, dividing the consumers into 10 income ranges5 (POF1 to POF10).  

 

                                                           
5 POF1 ranges from 0 to 2 minimum wages, POF2 from 2+ to 3, POF3 from 3+ to 5, POF4 from 5+ to 6, POF5 from 6-8, POF6 
from 8-10, POF7 from 10-15, POF8 from 15-20, POF9 from 20-30, and POF10 above 30 minimum wages. The minimum wage 
in Brazil in 2005 was around US$150.00, considering US$1.00 = R$ 2.00 

13

The policies improved income distribution, especially Policy 3 (aggregate of policies 1 and 2) by 
reducing consumer prices for the POF1-POF5 income ranges, which represent consumers with the lowest 
incomes.  Moreover,  the  productivity  gains  observed  in  the  agricultural  frontier  spread  their  effects  by 
reducing  prices  in  other  regions  of  the  country.  For  example,  in  RestNE  (Ceará,  Rio  Grande  do  Norte, 
Paraíba,  and  Sergipe)  and  PernAlag  (Pernambuco  and  Alagoas),  two  of  the  least  developed  regions  of 
Brazil, prices were also affected. 

Table 6 shows the impact of productivity gains in terms of land prices. As expected, land prices 
dropped in almost all scenarios, except in that of Policy 2. In this case, the increase in productivity in crops 
did not lead to a reduction in the prices of pasturelands, as occurred with Policy 1, whose shock on livestock 
effectively reduced the prices of cropland.

The effects of Policy 1 spread to other regions (LndUsed) beyond the agricultural frontier, where 
the  shock  was  applied.  These  effects  were  brought  about  by  an  increase  in  land  supply  resulting  from 
productivity gains in livestock in the frontier region. The main difference of these results, also showed by 
Policy 3, was the magnitude of the drop in prices. 

 Policy 2, in turn, signals something different for pastures. In this case, the price of pasturelands 
increased,  since  there  were  no  changes  in  livestock  productivity  and  this  activity  continues  to  be  land-
intensive, especially in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, as shown in Table 7.

In Policy 1, the productivity shock reduced pasturelands in all the considered biomes, but it did 
not impose constraints on the growth of crops and native vegetation areas. On the contrary, it can increase 
land supply for those activities. In Policy 2, productivity gains in crops curbed the clearing of forests and 
fields in the Amazon (stable), Cerrado (0.08%), and Caatinga (0.03%) biomes, as expressed by the variation 
in  the  “Unused”  category,  which  was  close  to  zero.  Despite  the  small  magnitude  of  those  results,  they 
highlight the livestock-deforestation relationship through the growth of cattle farming in areas of natural 
vegetation,  especially  in  the  Amazon  Biome.  Nevertheless,  under  Policy  2,  the  livestock-deforestation 
relationship was controlled by productivity gains in agriculture that made more land available for expanding 
livestock activities. 

It is worth highlighting that cattle farming is seen as the main trigger of deforestation. Thus, when 
livestock expansion is controlled through, for example, productivity gains, there is no spillover effect of 
deforestation to the other biomes. In other words, Borlaug’ Hypothesis is fully met, as in policies 1 and 3. 
However, when such activity is neglected, as in Policy 2, there is a sort of “leakage” and deforestation is 
displaced to other biomes, meaning that Borlaug’s Hypothesis is only partially met. 

In Policy 3, the increasing productivity of both livestock and agriculture can lead to mixed and/or 
overlapping results. This is what happened in the Cerrado region, where the broader shock of productivity 
(agriculture + livestock) led to a reduction in both crop and livestock areas, as shown in Figure 8.

Decreasing  land  reallocation  and  deforestation  rates  were  key  for  reducing  domestic  GHG 
emissions. This result should be considered not only from the perspective of avoided emissions, but also 
from that of removals generated in native vegetation areas. Figure 9, for example, shows how productivity 
gains in livestock (Policy 1) can be an important tool for slowing down domestic emissions. In this case, 
productivity increases tend to decrease land conversion rates, especially those of conversion into pastures, 
thus reducing GHG emissions. Those effects are more intense in the Amazon Biome, which has the largest 
amount of carbon accumulated above and below the soil in relation to other biomes.

Cerrado Biome in turn, accounted for the greatest reduction in GHG emissions. This was due to 
the absence of constraints on land expansion, as well as to the proximity between the Cerrado and Amazon

and releasing GHG. Furthermore, productivity increases in crops tend to boost the growth of crop areas, 
which explains the reduction in emissions from crops that occurred under Policy 2, as shown in Figure 10.

Under Policy 3, as noted before, the results may be mixed and/or overlapping. This happened in 
terms  of  land  allocation  and  GHG  emissions.  Figure  34,  for  example,  shows  the  representative  case  of 
emissions from the Cerrado Biome, where shocks on agriculture and livestock were combined, reducing 
crop  and  pasture  areas.  This  effect  also  affects  emissions  from  the  Cerrado  region,  which  follow  the 
behavior of crop and pasture areas, as shown in Figure 11.

Table 8 shows the efficiency of Policy 3 – which is the combination of the policies 1 and 2 – in 
curbing  GHG  emissions.  Thus,  emissions  by  source  in  the  initial  (2005)  and  final  (2035)  periods  were 
considered. In addition, the shares of each source in total emissions from Brazil were also considered.

In the initial period, emissions related to land-use changes accounted for 62.7% of total emissions 
from  the  country,  or  for  1,329,081  gigagrams  of  dioxide  carbon  equivalent  (Gg.  of  CO2eq.).  However, 
under Policy 3, such total drops by more than half, by -58.4%, which corresponds to 552,437 Gg. of CO₂ 
eq.  Thus,  productivity  gains  in  agriculture  as  a  whole  (crop  +  livestock)  are  an  important  tool  to  curb 
deforestation and reduce domestic GHG emissions. Furthermore, it does not impose constraints on other 
economic sectors, for example, on the industrial sector, apart from benefiting the climate.  

Finally, the policies were effective in  promoting economic and  environmental  gains.  However, 
these  achievements  tend  to  vanish  as  the  productivity  effects  fade  away  and  more  technology  becomes 
necessary to promote them again. This is not a trivial task, especially in a country with high productivity 
rates in agriculture. Thus, this sector must consider other alternatives to keep growing, such as, for example, 
that of promoting shifts to new regions where land is still available, as in the northeast, where almost half 
the native vegetation (Caatinga) was deforested in the past. 

 

5 Final remarks 

This article analyzed the impacts of productivity  gains in agriculture on the economy, land use 
changes, and GHG emissions. The results show that the policies considered here can “save” land and thus 
avoid more deforestation, as stated by Borlaug’s Hypothesis. In addition, the policies managed to reduce 
GHG emissions from all Brazilian biomes, especially from the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. 

Increases in agricultural productivity benefit the country as a whole, as a result of their positive 
macroeconomic effects, such as higher consumption, production and investment levels and GDP growth. 
In addition, income distribution was enhanced by lower prices for the poorest households. 

It is worth highlighting how the policies were efficient in reducing deforestation and emissions in 
the Cerrado and Amazon biomes, according to the shock considered. The effects of the Borlaug Hypothesis, 
although suitable for Brazil, may vary according to the biome and activity (livestock or agriculture) under 
analysis, and in some cases they can be strengthened, as in the Cerrado region under Policy 3.  

Finally, this study took a step forward in studying land use change and its integration into GHG 
emissions in a CGE model, as tailored to the Brazilian case. The role of productivity gains was demonstrated 
as an alternative for reducing deforestation and increasing, or at least preserving, the growth of agricultural 
production. However, the results show that the effects  of the policies  are limited if they  are focused on 
productivity with no other alternatives for agriculture, since productivity gains tend to fade away. In this 
regard, other issues should be considered as part of the solution for the trade-off between agriculture and 
deforestation.  A  good  alternative  is  to  turn  to  other  previously  deforested  regions  that  are  suitable  for 
agriculture, such as Brazil’s northeast region, which would reduce the pressure on forested areas.
