Abstract 

 

This article presents a contribution to the  literature on monetary policy and bank regulation since it 
assesses the link involving monetary policy, capital regulation and risk-taking. This link is explored in 
an important  inflation targeting emerging economy (Brazil) that for  several decades has experienced 
extremely high interest rates and simultaneously a high degree of banking solvency – as measured by 
the  Capital  Adequacy  Ratio  (CAR).  The  study  provides  the  following  evidences  through  different 
econometric  methods:  (i)  monetary  policy  affects  bank  solvency  (financial  stability)  through  loan 
provisions; and (ii) there is no trade-off between loan provisioning and bank capital. Taken together, 
these evidences suggest that: (i) a banking supervision strategy must take into account the outcomes of 
monetary  policy  on  financial  stability;  and  (ii)  the  demand  for  additional  provision,  which  is  an 
important  instrument used by banking supervisors, does not have the desired effect in a high  interest 
rate economy.

1. Introduction 

The  inflation  targeting  framework  (IT)  has  been  adopted  by  several  central  banks  as  a 
strategy  to  implement  monetary  policy.  IT’s  main  feature  is  the  official  announcement  of 
ranges  for  inflation  fluctuations  and  the  explicit  recognition  that  the  main  goal  of  monetary 
policy  is  to  assure  low  and  stable  inflation  rates.  As  pointed  out  by  de  Mendonça  and  de 
Guimarães e Souza (2012), inflation is like a disease without cure and IT is a good remedy to 
control but  not to eliminate  inflation. On the other  hand,  like any remedy, IT  has side effects, 
and  these  effects  can  exceed  the  targets  of  monetary  policy.  When  policymakers  alter  the 
interest rate they only aim at inflation, but as a side effect they change banks’ behavior. Since 
banks’ behavior is an issue for financial stability policy, there is a logical relationship between 
the IT framework and the financial stability policy. 

The  idea that  monetary policy alters banks’ behavior  is  not  new.  Bernanke  (1983) states 
that  the  great  depression  was  aggravated  by  banks’  reactions  to  monetary  policy.  But  the 
connection between  monetary policy and  financial  stability  is still rare  in  the  literat ure  about 
emerging  economies.  Before  the  2008-2009  financial  crisis,  there  was  a  consensus  that  the 
relationship  between  financial  stability  and  banking  behavior  was  a  regulatory  issue.  The 
financial  crisis  put  the  accepted  assumptions  of  financial  stability  to  the  test  and  created  an 
environment of uncertainty  with potential  impacts on the conduction of  monetary policy. The 
aftermath of the crisis  gave birth  to a  new  view  where  financial  stability  has  to be a part of 
economic  policy,  like  monetary  and  fiscal  policy.  So,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  how 
monetary policy  influences  financial stability,  which  is a relevant part  of the ongoing debate 
over appropriate central bank tools for achieving financial stability.  

In  consonance  with this point of  view,  many  financial stability committees  were  created 
around the world after the crisis (for  instance, the Financial Stability Oversight Council  was 
created  in  the  United  States  in  July  2010;  in  England,  the  Financial  Service  Act  created  the 
Financial Policy Committee  in  December 2012;  in July 2011, Chile created  the  “Consejo de 
Estabilidad  Financiera”  and  Mexico  created  the  “Consejo  de  Estabilidad  del  Sistema 
Financiero” in July 2010). 

Despite the  fact that the Brazilian economy did not suffer  huge effects  from  the crisis,  in 
May  2011  the  Central  Bank  of  Brazil  (CBB)  created  the  Financial  Stability  Committee 
(COMEF). The aim is to achieve an institutional upgrade in the accomplishment of the CBB’s 
mission,  namely  price  and  financial  stability.  Hence,  there  is  a  clear  opportunity  for 
coordinated action of monetary policy and financial stability management.   

The  Brazilian  economy  has  some  features  that  make  it  an  important  case  study  for  the 
relationship between monetary policy and financial stability. IT was  adopted in Brazil in June 
1999. The  main  task of  the CBB  is to  guide public expectations towards the  inflation target 
defined  by  the  National  Monetary  Council.  The  main  feature  of  monetary  policy  during  the 
entire period  under IT  in Brazil  was  high  interes t rates. The average  rate  in these  years  was 
higher  than  14%  a  year.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  same  period  there  was  no  noticeable 
problem  with  Brazilian  banks,  even  during  the  subprime  crisis.  Brazil  was  considered  a 
successful case of high resilience of  the financial sector and Brazil’s financial supervision was 
praised.  Under  IT,  the  Brazilian  economy  was  characterized  by  the  coexistence  of  high 
interest  rates  and  financial  stability,  which  suggests  that  monetary  policy  can  contribute  to 
financial  stability  in  terms  of  banking  solvency.  That  leads  to  the  following  question:  What 
kind  of  relationship  does  exist  between  monetary  policy  and  banking  behavior  in  terms  of 
solvency in a high interest rate economy?  

This  study  is  a  contribution  to  understand  this  relationship.  In  particular,  it  is  a 
contribution  on  how  banking  solvency  reacts  to  monetary  policy,  shedding  light  on  a  little 
explored  transmission  channel,  namely  the  risk-taking  channel  (Borio  and  Zhu,  2012).  The 

2 

 

novelty of the paper regards  the  analysis of  the  link, which  involves capital  regulation, risk-
taking and  monetary policy.  This  link  is explored  in an  important IT emerging economy that 
for  several  decades  has  experienced  extremely  high  interest  rates  and  simultaneously  a  high 
degree of banking solvency – as measured by the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).  

This paper  is organized as  follows.  The  next section presents the  importance of  financial 
stability  and  how  financial  regulation  works.  Section  three  presents  the  transmission 
mechanism  of  monetary  policy  through  the  bank  lending  channel  and  the  bank  risk-taking 
channel.  Section  four  provides  empirical  evidence  through  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS), 
generalized  method of  moments (GMM), system-GMM and dynamic analysis through  vector 
autoregression. Section five concludes.  
 
2. Financial Stability 
 

Banking is one of the most regulated sectors in the economy. Llewellyn (1999) presents a 
whole set of economic reasons justifying the existence of banking regulation, among them the 
fact that banks play a central role in the financial system and their impact on the real economy 
is  immediate,  since  many companies depend on banks as their sole source of  funding,  not to 
mention the effect of consumer credit on aggregate demand.  

Aligned  with  these  arguments,  Stiglitz  and  Greenwald  (2003)  affirm  that  when  a  bank 
faces bankruptcy or is sold, a significant amount of information concerning its debtors is lost. 
As  a  consequence,  the  time  needed  for  the  competition  to  acquire  information  and  resume 
lending  at  the  same  level  and  diversity  previously  observed  may  lead  to  a  discontinuity  in 
business. 

Other  economic  reasons  used  by  Llewellyn  (1999)  to  advocate  regulation  are:  the 
contagion risk, which can lead to a run on deposits; the liquidity mismatch between assets and 
liabilities,  which  is  inherent  to banks’ balance sheets and  makes them  vulnerable  to  rumors; 
and finally the interconnection between banks conjugated with the perception depositors have 
that  requests  to  withdraw  money  will  be  satisfied  o n  a  first  in  first  out  basis.  These  are 
economic  reasons  that  reveal  the  level  of  fragility  faced  by  banks  and  support  the  need  for 
regulation. 

Blinder (2010) argues that systemic risk is one that is either large enough in size or broad 
enough  in  scope  that,  if  things  go  wrong,  can  damage  a  significant  portion  of  the  financial 
system. Therefore,  financial stability depends on keeping systemic risk at bay.  Disruption of 
financial  stability  can  be  triggered  in  many  ways:  be  it  the  collapse  of  a  huge  financ ial 
institution, the coordinated  movement of smaller  firms or the  failure of  intertwined  firms that 
can drag others through their connections and provoke damage out of proportion to their size.  
Banking  regulation  critics  argue  that  investors  are  capable  of  choosing  and  separating 
between sound and  unhealthy banks. Hence, this ability  is the  guardian of the system and  not 
regulation. However, as  Goodhart et al. (1998) point out,  investors are not  in a  good position 
to  judge  a  bank’s  soundness  due  to  asymmetric  information  between  banks  and  clients.  In 
turn, asymmetric information is intrinsic to the banking business.  

According  to  Mishkin  (2000),  prudential  supervision,  broadly  construed,  involves 
government  regulation  and  monitoring  of  the  banking  system  to  e nsure  its  safety  and 
soundness.  Considering  the  asymmetry  in  the  banking  business  and  aiming  to  create 
incentives that  minimize banks’ exposure to bankruptcy risks,  prudential supervision chooses 
capital requirements as its main regulatory tool.  

Essentially structured as a  leverage ratio, capital requirements  have converged  to the so-
called  Basel  Accords. Supported by  the seal of  the  Bank  for International Settlements  (BIS), 
the third Basel Accord, although not fully deployed, defines that the amount of cap ital divided 
by  the  risk-weighted  assets  must  be  at  least  10.5%.  Capital  and  risk-weighted  assets  are 
3 

 

constructs developed by  the Basel Committee  on  Banking Supervision (BCBS), and both are 
broad  enough  to  capture  subordinated  liabilities  such  as  capital  a nd  credit,  market  and 
operational risks as risk-weighted assets. 

As  Mishkin  (2000)  pointed  out,  the  goal  of  prudential  supervision  ranges  from  the 
assessment  of  the  quality  of  banks’  assets,  especially  loans,  to  the  point  of  determining 
additional allowances. Provisioning is the mechanism that banks use to adjust the outstanding 
value  of  loans  to  reflect  losses  arising  from  credit  risk  (quality  of  the  loan  portfolio).  The 
reduction in the value of loans corresponds to a reduction in the bank’s profits, whic h can also 
be  understood  as  a  reduction  in  the  net  asset  value  of  the  bank.  Individually  considered, 
provisioning reduces the CAR,  since  it affects capital  much  more  heavily  than risk-weighted 
assets,  respectively the  numerator and denominator of  the  CAR (Borio and  Lowe, 2001).  As 
Borio  and  Lowe  (2001)  detected,  provisioning  enhances  the  transparency  of  banks’  balance 
sheets  as  well  as  increases  the  volatility  and  cyclicality  of  banks’  profits.  In  principle, 
provisioning  should  lead  to  a  more  accurate  picture  of  both  a  bank’s  earnings  and  its  assets 
than would be the case if all loans were measured at their outstanding value.   

From a banking supervisor’s standpoint, provisions are regarded as  important prudential 
tools because they ensure that banks keep adequate protection against  future  loan  losses. This 
point  of  view  is  supported  by  the  BCBS,  which  recommends  that  banking  supervisors 
determine  the  adequacy  of  banks’  policies  and  processes  for  grading  and  classifying  their 
assets  and  establishing  appropriate  and  robust  provisioning  levels  for  loans. 1  Besides  this,  it 
also  recommends  that  banking  supervisors  should  assess  whether  the  classification  of  assets 
and  their  provisioning  is  adequate  for  prudential  purposes.  If  assets’  classifications  are 
inaccurate or provisions are deemed to be  insufficient  for prudential purposes, the  supervisor 
has  the power to require the bank to adjust  its classifications of  individual assets,  increase  its 
level of provisioning, reserves or capital and, if necessary, impose other measures.  

Since capital and provisioning levels are proxies of the soundness of a bank as well as the 
financial  system,  they  can  also  be  understood  as  flags  to  detect  problems,  allowing  banking 
supervisors to act prudentially to avoid financial instability. 

The  financial system  is  not a closed system. It  feels the  influence of the  macroeconomic 
environment,  mainly  through  the  transmission channels of  monetary policy. In this  way,  the 
Committee  on  International  Economic  Policy  Reforms  (CIEPR)  recognizes  that  financial 
stability  should  be  an  explicit  objective  of  central  banks  and  monetary  policy  should  be 
regarded as a legitimate part of the macroprudencial toolkit (CIEPR, 2011).   

Hence, understanding the relationship between financial stability and monetary policy has 
a crucial role in the definition of new regulatory strategies, as well as in the action of banking 
supervision.  This  understanding  must begin  with the basic elements of  financial  stability and 
monetary  policy.  From  financial  stability,  the  elements  are  the  average  level  of  loan 
provisions and the CAR of the  financial system. From  monetary policy,  the elements are  the 
basic  interest  rate  and  the  transmission  mechanisms  of  monetary  policy.  The  issue  is  how 
monetary policy impacts banks’ level of provision and CAR, and through which channels this 
impact can be observed.  
 
3. Bank Lending Channel to Risk-Taking Channel  

The  initial  approaches  concerning  the  impact  of  monetary  policy  on  banks  were  the 
works  about  asymmetric  information  (Akerlof,  1969;  Stiglitz  and  Weiss,  1981),  which 
revealed  that  the credit  market  is  subject to  failures and  inefficiencies and  this causes  effects 
on the aggregate economic activity (Greenwald et al., 1984). In particular, it is recognized that

problems of  information create a set of  mechanisms that propagate and amplify  initial  shocks 
to  the  economy  (Bernanke,  1983).  There  are  two  main  types  of  such  mechanisms,  called 
credit  channels:  (i)  the  lending  channel,  which  emphasizes  the  existence  of  shocks  that  can 
affect  the  ability/willingness  of  banks  to  supply  credit  to  bank-dependent  firms,  and  (ii)  the 
balance sheet channel, which emphasizes the existence of  shocks that can affect the  financial 
position of  firms and  households and thus their ability  to access the credit  market (Hubbard, 
1995; Bernanke and Gertler, 1995).   

Despite  the  fact  that  empirical  evidence  regarding  the  functioning  of  monetary  policy 
through  the  risk-taking  channel  is  scarce  and  focused  on  monetary  policy,  the  available 
literature is useful to understand the link between monetary policy and financial stability.  

The risk-taking channel refers  to  how changes  in  monetary policy rates affect either risk 
perceptions  or  risk  tolerance  (Borio  and  Zhu,  2012).  According  to  this  perspective,  easy 
monetary  conditions  represent  a  standard  element  in  boom-bust  type  business  fluctuations, 
i.e., low interest rates may lead to financial imbalances through a reduction in risk aversion of 
banks,  affecting  the  supply  of  credit,  the  credit  spread  and,  as  a  consequence,  economic 
decisions,  causing  business  fluctuations.  Although  several  authors  have  studied 
the 
relationship between  monetary policy  and business  fluctuations,  Borio and  Zhu (2012)  argue 
that  insufficient  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  link  between  monetary  policy  and  the 
perception and pricing of risk by economic agents, i.e., to the risk-taking channel. 

Regarding the relationship between  monetary policy (through the basic  interest  rate) and 
the  risk-taking  channel,  Altunbas  et  al.  (2014)  and  Gambacorta  (2009)  emphasize  that  there 
are  two  main  ways  in  which  low  interest  rates  can  influence  bank  risk-taking.  First,  low 
interest  rates  affect  valuations,  incomes  and  cash  flows,  which  in  turn  can  influence  how 
banks  measure risk (Adrian and Shin, 2009a and 2009b; Borio and  Zhu, 2012). Second,  low 
returns on  investments, such as government (risk-free) securities,  may  increase  incentives  for 
banks,  asset  managers  and  insurance  companies  to  take  on  more  risk  for  behavioral, 
contractual  or 
target 
(Brunnermeier, 2001; Rajan, 2005).  

institutional  reasons,  for  example 

to  meet  a  nominal  return 

Unequivocally,  monetary policy  influences  the  risk-taking of banks. However, there are 
other possible causes of changes  in banks’  risk perception. The  work of  Tabak, Noronha and 
Cajueiro  (2011)  analyzes  the  relationship  between  economic  cycles  and  capital  buffers  held 
by banks in Brazil. They evaluate the effects of bank capital on lending activity and how these 
effects vary among banks with different ownership structure. They  use  unbalanced panel data 
of  Brazilian  institutions  from 2000 to 2010 to estimate an equation  for capital buffers and  for 
loan growth. The results reveal  that the economic cycle negatively affects  the surplus capital. 
These results have important implications in terms of capital regulation.  

The  work  of  Tabak,  Laiz  and  Cajueiro  (2010)  investigates  the  effects  of  monetary 
policy on banks’  loans  growth and  non-performing  loans  for the period 2003-2009  in  Brazil. 
The results suggest the existence of a bank lending channel by showing that during periods of 
monetary tightening/loosing, banks’ outstanding loan amounts decreased/increased. They a lso 
found  that  the  financial  crisis  had  a  large  impact  on  lending  activity  and  that  state-owned 
banks seem to respond more to monetary policy changes than foreign and domestically owned 
private  banks.  Moreover,  by  analyzing  the  impacts  of  monetary  policy  o n  non-performing 
loans,  they  found  that  during  periods  of  interest  rate  increase/decrease,  banks  present  a 
higher/lower  growth  rate  of  non-performing  loans,  which  may  aggravate/alleviate  their 
performance.  In  addition,  state-owned  banks  have  a  different  lending  profile,  since  they 
present  a  lower  amount  of  non-performing  loans.  Furthermore,  the  results  also  support  the 
existence of a risk-taking channel,  in which  lower  monetary policy rates  increase banks’ risk-
taking.  During  periods  of  low  interest  rates,  large  and  liquid  banks  increase  their  credit  risk 
exposure.

Despite the  increase  in the  number of papers concerning  the risk-taking channel  after 
the  crisis,  there  is  still  sparse  literature  associating  it  with  financial  regulation  in  emerging 
economies.  In  this  regard,  the  work  of  Montes  and  Peixoto  (2014)  is  a  first  step  in  this 
direction.  They  found  evidence  that  both  the  lending  channel  and  the  risk-taking  channel 
operate  in  the  Brazilian  financial  system.  Banks  react  to  monetary  policy  by  altering  the 
amount of provisions (expected  loss) of  their  loan portfolios  and also the spread charged. In 
an  environment  of  lax  monetary  policy,  banks  take  more  risks,  reducing  expected  loss 
(provisions) and spreads. Moreover, this study found evidence that banks increase loans when 
the  economy  booms,  enhancing  the  procyclical  nature  of  the  banking  system.  Besides 
confirming  the  criticism  found  in  the  literature  concerning  the  procyclicality  of  the  banking 
system,  the  approach  used  in  Montes  and  Peixoto  (2014)  sets  the  stage  to  explore  banking 
solvency  in  terms  of  the  loan  provisions.  As  defined  by  the  Basel  Accords,  loan  provisions 
(expected loss) directly affect the equity of banks, so it is a crucial co nstituent of the CAR.  

The  expected  trade-off  between  provisions  (expected  loss)  and  the  CAR  (unexpected 
losses)  is  the  main  tool  used  by  banking  supervisors.  When  banking  supervisors  ask  for 
additional  provisions,  they  expect  that  the  impact  on  banks’  capital  and  CAR  creates  an 
incentive  for  banks  to  be  more  cautious  regarding  the  quality  of  the  assets  originated. 
However,  considering  the  influence  that  monetary  policy  has  on  banks’  provisioning  levels, 
its effect  must be  taken  into account  in banking supervision strategy. Accordingly,  this  study 
is a counterpoint to the works of Altunbas et al. (2014) and Jiménez et al. (2014). The former 
found  evidence  that  low  interest  rates  over  an  extended  period  contribute  to  an  increase  in 
bank  risk.  The  latter  identified  that  a  lower  interest  rate  induces  lower  capitalized  banks  to 
expand credit to riskier firms. We analyzed the risk-taking channel in Brazil, an economy that 
experienced high interest rates for more than 10 years. Therefore, understanding the impact of 
the  risk-taking  channel  in  economies  with  different  features  is  crucial  to  improve  the  tools 
used  for banking  supervision. To do this,  it  is  necessary to  fill  in  the blanks of the risk-taking 
channel.  This  can  be  done  by  including  economic  variables  that  explain  the  aggregate 
behavior of the CAR in the analysis.   
 
4. Empirical Analysis 
 
4.1  The  Brazilian  Banking  system,  implementation  of  the  capital  require ments  and 
macroeconomic adjustme nts 
 

In  the  Brazilian  financial  system’s  current  arrangement,  the  main  institutions  are 
universal  banks,  which  provide  a  wide  range  of  banking  services.  Two  characteristics 
dominate the  financial system  in  Brazil:  market concentration and state control over some of 
the  major  institutions.  According to  the IMF (2012a),  the  Brazilian  financial system  is  large, 
concentrated,  and  highly  interconnected  domestically.  There  are  1,475  deposit-taking 
financial  institutions,  with  assets  exceeding  100  percent  of  GDP,  including  137  banks,  4 
development banks, and one savings bank as of November 2011.  The set of the  five biggest 
universal banks accounts  for  two-thirds of  total assets.  These banks are  usually part of  larger 
financial  conglomerates,  which often  include  insurance and asset  management.  The banking 
system  reports  high  levels  of  capitalization,  liquidity  and  profitability.  In  September  2011, 
Brazilian banks,  in  general,  were capitalized above  minimum  regulatory  levels.  The average 
CAR was 17.17 percent, well above the 11 percent required in Brazil, and above the 8 percent 
required  by  the  Basel  I  and  Basel  II  methodologies.  The  leverage  ratio  (9.57)  and  liquidity 
ratio (around 1.08) were also prudentially adequate. (IMF, 2012a, p. 5). 

In  Brazil, the  implementation of Basel  II began  in 2007.  According to the  IMF (2012a), 
Brazil  has  a  well-defined  banking  supervision  process  supported  by  a  legal  framework  that 

6 

 

grants  the  CBB  broad  enforcement  powers  for  corrective  action  and  weak  powers  for  bank 
resolution.  The  supervisory  process  is  risk-based  and  intrusive.  The  process  is  based  on  a 
supervisory  cycle  that  includes  a  mix  of  onsite  and  offsite  activities  and  concludes  with  a 
rating of  the bank on a scale of one  to  four based on quantitative and qualitative  factors.  The 
timeliness of corrective action has been improved by the adoption of regulations (resolutions) 
that  enable  the  CBB  to  impose  corrective  action  based  on  judgmental  factors,  such  as  the 
adequacy  of  corporate  governance.  Prior  to  the  implementation  of  the  Pillar  2  style 
resolutions, the CBB enforcement was  focused on corrective enforcement, while now  it takes 
a more preventive approach that can correct unsafe and unsound practices before they  impact 
the bank’s condition. Banks are subject to corporate law in the area of dividend payout, which 
establishes  that  a  25  percent  minimum  of  profits  must  be  paid  to  preferred  shareholders. 
Although the CBB could mitigate the requirement by asking for additional capital to offset the 
dividend,  this requirement  hinders  the ability of the  CBB to preserve capital  in a weak bank 
situation (IMF, 2012a, p. 3). 

The  positive  performance  of  the  Brazilian  economy,  even  after  the  worsening  of  the 
global  crisis  in  the  second  half  of  2008,  reflects  the  efforts  to  consolidate  macroeconomic 
fundamentals. Regarding the  macroeconomic environment,  long before the crisis  –  since  the 
mid-1990s  –  Brazil  had  adopted  standard  macroeconomic  policies  to  control  inflation  and 
anchor  expectations,  including  an  IT  framework  (adopted  in  1999).  Fiscal  policies  were 
strengthened to ensure that markets perceived debt dynamics as sustainable. Moreover, Brazil 
opted for a flexible exchange rate regime as a first buffer against capital market mood swings 
and  volatility.  Last  but  not  least,  Brazil  did  not  embark  on  the  fashionable  financial 
deregulation movement of the 1990s, keeping a conservative prudential regulatory framework 
for  its  financial  sector, which remained tightly  supervised and well capitalized. Nevertheless, 
the  crisis  caught  emerging  and  advanced  economies  in  quite  different  positions  in  the 
spectrum  of  macro  and  financial  fragility:  the  former  were  ending  a  cycle  of  macro  policy 
consolidation and  had stronger  financial sectors that  had been tested through crises; the  latter 
were  at  the  peak  of  a  cycle  of  credit-fueled  consumption  growth  and  had  allowed  their 
financial  sectors  to  become  highly  vulnerable  to  shifts  in  confidence  and  changes  in  asset 
price  valuation  in  their  balance  sheets.  Fortunately,  many  emerging  markets  could  also 
implement countercyclical policies to  support activity thanks to  the  robust  fundamentals and 
policy credibility built throughout a decade- long adjustment effort (Silva and Harris, 2012). 2  
The cornerstone of Brazil’s monetary stability is the IT framework, adopted  in June 1999. 
This  framework  includes  all  the  features  of  a  full- fledged  IT  regime,  including:  1)  the 
announcement of  multi- year  inflation  targets; 2) assigning  to the National Monetary Council 
the responsibility  for setting the  inflation targets and tolerance ranges based on a proposal by 
the  minister  of  finance;  3)  giving  to  the  CBB  full  responsibility  to  implement  the  policies 
needed to attain  the  inflation targets; 4) establishing procedures to  increase the central bank’s 
accountability (specifically,  if the target  range  is breached, the central bank president  would 
have  to  issue an open  letter  to the  minister of  finance explaining the causes of the deviation, 
the  measures that will be  taken  to eliminate  it, and  the time  it will take to  get  inflation back 
inside  the  tolerance  range)  and,  5)  taking  actions  to  improve  the  transparency  of  monetary 
policy.  The  CBB  conducts  monetary  po licy  in  order  to  minimize  deviations  of  inflation 
relative  to  the  inflation  target  and  fluctuations  in  the  output  gap,  but  also  in  order  to  guide 
agents’ expectations about inflation and future monetary policy.    

Financial  and  monetary  stability  are  crucia l  to  create  a  favorable  macroeconomic 
environment, but  how do they  impact each other?  Hence,  in order to estimate the  impact of

monetary  policy  on  Brazil’s  financial  system  stability,  we  conducted  an  empirical  analysis 
using  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS),  generalized  method  of  moments  (GMM)  and  a  GMM 
system.  One  reason  for  using  GMM  is  that  while  OLS  estimations  have  problems  of  serial 
autocorrelation,  heteroskedasticity  or  non- linearity,  which  is  typical  in  macroeconomic  time 
series,  this  method  provides  consistent  estimators  for  the  regressions  (Hansen,  1982).  As 
pointed out by Wooldridge (2001, p. 95), “to obtain a  more efficient estimator than two-stage 
least  squares  (or  ordinary  least  squares),  one  must  have  overriding  restrictions.”  The 
weighting  matrix  in  the  equation  was  chosen  to  enable  the  GMM  estimates  to  be  robust, 
considering the possible presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of unknown form.   
As pointed out by Cragg  (1983), overidentification analysis  has an  important  role  in  the 
selection of  instrumental  variables to  improve the efficiency of the estimators. We performed 
a  standard  J-test  with  the  objective  of  testing  this  property  for  the  validity  of  the 
overidentifying restrictions (Hansen, 1982).  The chosen  instruments were dated  to the period 
t−1 or earlier to  help predict the  contemporaneous  variables,  which are  unavailable at  time t. 
This procedure for the choice of instrumental variables follows Johnston (1984).   
 
4.2 Data 
 

The  period  of  analysis  runs  from  July  2001  to  December  of  2013.  The  monthly  series 

used in this study are:  
Capital  Adequacy  Ratio  (CAR)  -  The  CAR  is  treated  as  an  indicator  of  solvency  of  a 
financial  institution.  The  higher  the  index  above  the  minimum  rate  set  by  the  supervising 
authority,  the  greater  the  surplus  of  equity,  or  equity,  to  conduct  transactions  that  generate 
additional  risks.  This  variable  represents  the  capital  to  risk-weighted  assets  ratio.  National 
regulators  track  a  bank's  CAR  to  ensure  that  it  can  absorb  a  reasonable  amount  of  loss  and 
complies  with  statutory  capital  requirements.  This  series  is  obtained  from  the  CBB  (series 
21424). 
Provision (PROV) - This  variable represents the expected  losses,  the amount provisioned by 
banks  in relation to  loans. The calculation of this  indicator was  used by  Tabak, Noronha and 
Cajueiro (2011), and the indicator is the difference between “Provisions for credit transactions 
in the private financial system” and  “Provisions  for credit transactions  in the private  financial 
system (total H)”, which are in arrears for more than 180 days, divided by “credit transactions 
in  the  private  financial  system  (total  credit  to  private  sector)”.  All  series  used  in  the 
calculation  of  this  variable  are  provided  by  the  CBB  (series  12929,  12977  and  4444).  In 
considering  the risk transactions (risk H) as  losses, this  measure can be viewed as a proxy  for 
the perception of ex-ante risk. 
Return on assets (ROA) - The series of return on assets  represents  how profitable a bank  is 
relatively  to  its  total  assets.  It  is  calculated  by  dividing  a  bank’s  annual  earnings  by  the 
average of the  last three  months of total assets. The series was obtained from the CBB (series 
21440). 
Default rate (DEFAULT) - The default rate represents the ratio between the  non-performing 
loans  (in  arrears  for  more  than  90  days)  and  the  total  amount  of  credit  transactions  in  the 
private  financial system. It  is expected that an  increase  in the default  level  worsens the credit 
market  conditions,  i.e.,  the  level  of  provisio ns.  The  series  is  provided  by  the  CBB  (series 
13673). 
Credit  gap  (C_GAP)  -  The  credit  gap  is  obtained  following  the  method  of  the  Basel 
Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  (BCBS)  (2010).  The  gap  is  the  difference  between  the 
credit/GDP  ratio  and  its  trend  (calculated  by  the  Hodrick-Prescott  filter).  The  series  of 
credit/GDP  ratio 
the  new 
recommendations  of  the  BCBS  (2010),  formalized  in  the  document  “Guidance  for  National 

is  available  from  the  CBB  (series  17474).  Considering 

8 

 

Authorities  Operating  the  Countercyclical  Capital  Buffer”,  this  indicator  should  be  used  by 
regulators  of  the  financial  system  as  a  criterion  for  activation  of  countercyclical  capital 
buffers. The goal is to increase the capacity of financial institutions to absorb losses above the 
minimum in good times of the economic cycle, so that in times of stress, the increased capital 
can be used. 3  
Basic interest rate (IR) - In Brazil, the basic interest rate (Selic)  is the  main  monetary policy 
instrument  under  the  regime  of  IT.  The  series  used  is  provided  by  the  CBB  (series  4189). 
According to  Tabak, Noronha and Cajueiro (2010), the  idea of  including this  variable  in  the 
analysis is to assess the impact of monetary policy on the financial system's exposure to credit 
risk.  A positive  relationship  is expected between the  variable IR and  the degree of perceived 
risk in the financial system posed by PROV. This relationship is explained by the presence of 
asymmetric  information  in  financial  markets,  leading  banks  to  increase  provisions  on  credit 
transactions when the basic interest rate increases.   
Reserve require ment  rate (R_REQ) -  This  monetary policy  instrument  has a direct  impact 
on the  volume of credit and thus on the  willingness of the  financial system  to take risks.  The 
data  used  to construct this series are available at the website of  the CBB (series 1883, 1884, 
1886  and  17633).  An  increase  in  this  rate  should  imply  fewer  available  resources  for 
applications  by  banks  and  greater  aversion  to  losses  of  the  financial  system,  which  in  turn 
promotes a decrease in credit supply and an increase  in provisions. 
Output gap (O_GAP) - This  indicator was constructed  from the series of  GDP accumulated 
in  12  months,  provided  by  the  CBB  (series  4190).  The  output  gap  is  obtained  by  the 
difference  between  the  GDP  series  and  its  long-term  trend  obtained  through  the  Hodrick-
Prescott  filter. Variations  in the economic cyc le are expected  to affect  the process of  lending 
and,  consequently,  the  amount  provisioned  by  banks.  Because  increased  economic  activity 
stimulates lending, a negative relationship is expected between O_GAP and PROV.   
Dummy  -  To  capture  the  effect  of  international  financial  shocks  on  the  Brazilian  economy 
from the subprime mortgage crisis and the crisis of government debt in Europe, we included a 
dummy  variable,  which  assumes  value  1  for  the  period  from  2008.10  to  2011.01  and  zero 
otherwise. 

This  work explores the connection between prudential regulation and  monetary policy  in 
consonance with the ideas presented by Borio and Zhu (2008)4. Thus two different models are 
presented.  First,  we  estimated  the  connections  between  monetary  policy  and  provisions 
following  Montes  and  Peixoto  (2014).  Second,  the  variable  PROV,  used  by  Montes  and 
Peixoto (2014)  in their work about  monetary policy,  is  included as an explanatory  variable of 
CAR to estimate the impact of monetary policy in prudential regulation, as shown in figure 1. 
In  turn,  the choice of PROV as a  monetary policy  transmission  mechanism  through the risk-
taking  channel  is  justified  by  the  results  found  by  Montes  and  Peixoto  (2014).  We  also 
checked  the  robustness  of  the  results.  For  this  we  estimated  a  system  of  equations  through 
GMM.  Besides,  variables  that  reflect  the  macroeconomic  context  and  the  behavior  of  banks 
are considered in the analysis.  

 

                                                                 
3  According  to  BCBS  (2010,  p.  9):  “The  specification of  the  credit-to-GDP gap  has a number of 
advantages  over  credit  growth.  Being  expressed  as  a  ratio  to  GDP,  the  indicator  variable  is 
normalised by the size of the economy. This means it is not influenced by the normal cyclical patterns 
of credit demand. Being measured as a deviation from its long -term trend, the credit-to-GDP gap 
allows for the well known secular financial deepening trend. Being a  ratio of levels, it is smoother 
than a variable  calculated as  differences  in  levels,  such as  credit growth, and  minimises spurious 
volatility (no large quarter-to-quarter swings).”  
4  Borio  and  Zhu  (2008)  states  that  the  understanding  of  the  interaction  between  prudential  regulat ion  and 
transmission mechanis m is still limited.

As  a  prerequisite  to  apply  the  estimations,  the  series  were  checked  on  the  existence  of

unit  roots,

4.3  Estimates  of  the  influence  of  macroeconomic  variables  and  monetary  policies  on 
provisions 
 

Following the estimation presented by Montes and Peixoto (2014) to explain the behavior 

of provisions, we estimated equation 1 below: 

Where, ϵ is a random error term.  

Table  1  shows 

the  estimates.  Due 

the  problems  of  autocorrelation  and 
heteroskedasticity, the reported t-statistics  in the OLS estimates are based on  the estimator of 
Newey  and  West  (1987).  5  In  terms  of  GMM  estimations 6,  the  J-statistic  indicates  that  we 
cannot reject the hypothesis that the model is correctly  specified.  

to 

Concerning  the  risk-taking  channel  and  therefore  the  influence  of  monetary  policy  on 
provisions,  the estimates confirm  the expected relations. Thus,  the positive  relation between 
IR and PROV can be interpreted as a result of information asymmetries (adverse selection and 
moral  hazard)  that  arise  in  the  credit  market  when,  for  example,  the  central  bank  raises  the 
short-term  interest  rate.  Besides,  regarding  the  link  between  monetary  policy  and  risk 
perceptions and attitudes, the findings are in agreement with the ideas presented by  Borio and 
Zhu  (2008)  and  Adrian  and  Shin  (2009b)  and  corroborate  the  findings  of  other  econometric 
studies (Altunbas et al., 2014; Gambacorta, 2009; Jiménez et al., 2014). 

                                                                 
5  Regard ing  OLS  estimates,  the  F-statistic  of  all  equations  indicates  that  the  regressions  are  significant. 
Furthermore, the outcomes of the Ra msey  RESET test indicate that the estimations do not present problems of 
model specification.

available  for  lending, this  monetary policy  instrument  makes credit transactions  more costly 
and  increases, at the same  time, the risk aversion of  financial  institutions.  The  results  found 
for  R_REQ  and  IR  corroborate  the  findings  presented  by  Montes  and  Peixoto  (2014)  and 
Tabak et al. (2010) for the risk-taking channel in Brazil.  

In  turn,  regarding  the  influence  of  economic  activity,  the  variable  O_GAP  showed 
statistical significance and the estimated coefficients presented the expected signs.  Therefore, 
the  inverse  relation between  the  level of activity  and the  variable PROV  is explained by  the 
procyclicality  of  banking  activity.  Thus,  as  shown  by  the  evidence,  in  times  of  economic 
expansion,  the expectations of default decrease and  the degree of  exposure  to risk  increases. 
Regarding  the  influence  of  the  variable  DEFAULT  on  the  variable  PROV,  the  evidence 
indicates  that  an  increase  in  DEFAULT  promotes  an  increase  in  PROV.  DEFAULT 
represents  the  effective  loss  and  PROV  means  the  expected  loss.  Therefore,  banks  increase 
provisions  when  the  default  rate  increases.  Estimates  related  to  this  variable  presented  the 
expected  sign  and  statistical  significance.  The  findings  for  the  influence  of  both  variables 
(O_GAP  and  DEFAULT)  on  PROV  are  in  agreement  with  those  presented  by  Montes  and 
Peixoto (2014). 

Moreover,  the dummy  variable presented  the expected  sign and statistical significance. 
In this sense, the evidence  indicates that banks  increased provisions during periods of crisis.  
In other words, banks react to the economic environment changing the expected loss.

solvency   
 

In  order  to  verify  the  relation  between  bank  solvency  and  provision,  we  tested  the 

following specification for the CAR:  
 

Where, 𝜉 is a random error term. 

 

Table 2 shows the estimates.  The  reported t-statistics  in the OLS estimates are based on 
the  estimator  of  Newey  and  West  (1987)  which  is  consistent  in  the  presence  of  both 
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of  unknown  form. 7 In terms of GMM estimations 8, the 
J-statistic indicates that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the model is correctly specified.  

The  results  suggest,  with  statistical  significance,  a  positive  relation  between  PROV  and 
CAR.  It  is  important  to  stress  that,  in  a  microprudential  view,  this  result  differs  from  the 
expected  by  financial  regulators,  but,  in  a  macroprudential  approach,  it  can  be  explained 
through  the  risk-taking  channel.  Both  PROV  and  CAR  mean  risk,  credit  risk  and  solvency 
risk,  so  under a  macroeconomic environment  they react  in  a similar way,  in agreement with 
the  ideas  presented  by  Goodhart  (2009)9.  The  dichotomy  observed  indicates  a  need  for  a 
better  articulation  between  the  banking  supervision  strategy  and  the  macroprudential  policy, 
once evidence indicates that there is no trade-off between PROV, an important tool in banking 
supervision, and CAR, a proxy of financial stability. 

Regarding the influence of ROA on CAR, the evidence indicates that an increase in ROA 
causes an  increase  in CAR. Therefore, banks  increase  CAR and become  more solvent  when 
their profitability  increases. Profits represent one of the  ways through which banks  can raise 
capital and consequently CAR.  The estimates related  to this  variable presented  the expected 
sign and statistical significance. 

Regarding C_GAP, when it increases, CAR decreases. The negative sign of the estimated 
coefficient shows  the adherence of  the countercyclical  indicator proposed  in  Basel  III to  the 
Brazilian case. The estimated coefficients show statistical significance for all estimations.   

Regarding the influence of DEFAULT on CAR, the evidence indicates that an increase in 
the default rate promotes a decrease  in  CAR.  Therefore, banks decrease CAR and reduce the 
risk exposure when  the default rate  increases. Estimates related  to this  variable presented the 
expected sign and statistical significance.  

Evidence points to a positive relationship between DEFAULT and PROV and a negative 
relationship  between  DEFAULT  and  CAR.  There  should  be  a  positive  relationship  between 
DEFAULT and PROV since an  increase  in the amount of credit  in arrears  for  more  than 90 
days  demands  an  increase  in  the  provisioning  level.  The  negative  relationship  between 
DEFAULT and CAR is also expected, since the additional provisioning caused by DEFAULT 
is  exogenous  to  the  banks’  will  and  leads  to  a  reduction  in  capital,  thus  reducing  CAR. 
However, provisioning is not just an objective decision based on default. If so, there would be 
a negative relationship between PROV and CAR,  mimicking  the  negative relationship  found 
between DEFAULT and CAR.  However, provisioning  has also an expectational component, 

                                                                 
7  In  terms  of  OLS  estimates,  the  F-statistic  of  all  equations  indicates  that  the  regressions  are  significant. 
Moreover,  the  outcomes  of  the  Ra msey  RESET  test  indicate  that  the  estimations  do  not  present  problems  of 
model specification.

shocks transmitted through the risk-taking channel. 

Therefore, additional provisioning  is  a deliberate practice and should only be performed 
in  accordance  with  the  maintenance  or  increase  of  CAR,  sending  a  message  of  safety  and 
soundness above any suspicion. 

In  turn,  regarding  the  influence  of  economic  activity,  O_GAP  showed  statistical 
significance  and  the  estimated  coefficients  presented  the  expected  signs.  Therefore,  the 
inverse relation between  the  level of activity and  CAR  is explained by the procyclical  nature 
of  banking  activity.  Thus,  as  shown  by  the  evidence,  in  times  of  economic  expansion,  the 
degree of exposure to risk increases.

4.5 System of equations for provisions and bank solvency  
 

The  previous  analysis  indicates  that  the  conduction  of  monetary  policy  through  interest 
rate  and  reserve  requirements  affect  provisions  and  provisions  affect  bank  solvency.  An 
additional  step  to  grant  robustness  to  the  equations  and  coefficients  previously  obtained 
through  OLS  and  GMM,  preserving  the  transmission  channel,  is  the  estimation  through  a

on the bank solvency,  we estimated a system of equations.  To deal with possible problems of 
endogeneity,  the  use  of  a  system  of  equations  which  applies  GMM  is  adequate  to  estimate 
unbiased coefficients. 10 Thus, we estimated the following system of equations (where ϑ and φ 
are random error terms).

Table 3  shows the estimation of the system. 11 All  coefficients  have signs  in accordance 
with  the  theoretical  view,  and  with  statistical  significance.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the 
coefficients obtained by the system are  more accurate than  those estimated  in  the  individual 
specifications, since the standard errors are smaller.

The estimates confirm the expected relations.  The evidence found suggests that monetary 
policy affects  financial  stability  in a  high  interest rate economy  in the same way as  in a  low 
interest rate economy. This result suggests that the coordination between monetary policy and 
financial stability matter, corroborating Cecchetti and Kohler (2014). A second finding is that 
banks react to the  macroeconomic environment  differently  from what  is expected by banking 
supervision.  Therefore,  an  important  microprudential tool  used by banking supervisors –  the 
demand  for additional provision – does not  have the desired effect  in a  macroprudential  way. 
The  result  supports  the  conclusion  of  Osiński,  Seal  and  Hoogduin  (2013)  on  the  need  for 
greater alignment between macro and microprudential policies. 12   

These  conclusions  allow  one  to  project  the  following  sequence  of  events:  a  rise  in  the 
basic  interest  rate  (due  to  a  rise  in  the  inflation  rate)  results  in  an  increase  in  banks’ 

                                                                 
10 The System-GMM applies the same instrumental variables as the GMM.   
11 Instruments and lags are the same as those applied in the estimat io n of the individual equations.

express a riskier credit portfolio and the latter is a counter- measure to face future losses in the 
credit portfolio without the  undesirable outcome of a reduction  in  CAR. On the other  hand, a 
reduction  in  the  interest  rate  brings  about  a  reduction  in  the  provisioning  level,  since  banks 
believe  the  credit  portfolio  is  less  risky,  and  also  reduces  CAR  and  solvency,  once  smaller 
expected  future  losses do  not demand additional  capital. Therefore, the evidence that banking 
solvency responds to shocks  from  monetary policy and provisioning strengthens the  idea that 
both  aspects  of  the  risk-taking  channel,  provision  and  banking  solvency,  are  operating  in 
Brazil, providing the link stated by Borio and Zhu (2012) in an emerging market economy. 

 

4.6 Dynamic analysis through vector autoregression (VAR) 
 

In  general,  the  dynamic  analysis  of  a  vector  autoregressive  (VAR)  model  is  performed 
through  methods  such  as  impulse  response  functions  because  it  permits  evaluation  of  the 
impulse  on  key  variables  caused  by  shocks  (or  innovations)  provoked  by  residual  variables 
over  time  (Sims,  1980).  As  pointed  out  by  Lutkenpohl  (1991),  the  conventional  method 
applies  the  “orthogonality  assumption”  and  thus  the  result  can  depend  on  the  ordering  of 
variables  in the VAR  model. Koop et  al.  (1996) and Pesaran and Shin (1998) de veloped  the 
idea  of  the  generalized  impulse  response  function  as  a  way  to  eliminate  the  problem  of 
ordering  of  variables  in  VAR  models.  The  main  argument  is  that  the  generalized  impulse 
responses are invariant to any re-ordering of the variables in the VAR. 

Thus,  aiming  at  eliminating  the  known  problem  in  the  results  caused  by  the  order  of 
variables  in the VAR  model,  we employ  the generalized  impulse  response  function  here.  The 
variables  used  in the analysis are:  PROV, CAR, DEFAULT, IR and  R_REQ.  The  choice of 
the  VAR  lag  order  was  determined  using  the  Schwarz  information  criterion  (SC)  and  the 
Hannan-Quinn  information criterion (HQ) (Table  A.2, appendix). Based on SIC and  HQ, the 
VAR  lag order  is 2 and both  tests  indicate  that  the  model  is  without a constant. The  stability 
test  for  the  VAR  is  shown  through  Figure  A.1  in  the  appendix.   Figure  2  below  shows  the 
results.

It  can  be  seen  that  an  unexpected  positive  shock  on  ir  causes  an  increase  in  PROV.  In 
turn, regarding the relationship between R_REQ and PROV, an unexpected positive shock on 
R_REQ  has  no effect on PROV.  The  impact of  the  main  instrument of  monetary po licy (the 
basic  interest  rate)  on  bank  behavior  is  an  important  aspect  for  financial  stability  policy 
efforts. This result is in agreement with the previous estimations in Table 1.   

In  relation  to  DEFAULT,  a  positive  shock  on  DEFAULT  increases  both  PROV  and 
CAR.  In  terms  of  the  effect  o n  CAR,  this  is  an  ambiguous  result  due  to  the  previous 
estimation  in  Tables 1, 2 and 3. Moreover,  the  statistical significance and the  signs  reinforce 
the positive indirect effect of DEFAULT on CAR. 

Furthermore, an  unexpected positive shock on PROV  increases CAR (banking  solvency) 
with statistical significance. The observed CAR response can be explained by banks’ decision 
to increase solvency in order to send a  message of safety and soundness to the market.  

Based on  the different  methods of analysis  (OLS,  GMM,  System  GMM and VAR),  the 
following  finding  is  important:  there  is  a  statistically  significant  positive  relation  between 
PROV  and  CAR.  This  result  confirm  the  absence  of  the  trade-off  between  provisions  and 
banking  solvency,  indicating  that  the  strategy  of  financial  stability  based  on  provision  and 
CAR must be better articulated. 

 

5. Concluding re marks  

 

The present study explored  the  link  involving capital regulation,  the risk-taking channel 
and  monetary policy  under  inflation targeting  in an emerging  market economy. In  this  sense, 
we  made  use  of  the  literature  on  monetary  transmission  mechanisms,  with  emphasis  on  the 
risk-taking channel. 

The  findings  indicate  that  the  risk-taking  channel  operates  in  Brazil.  Banks  react  to 
monetary  policy  (either  when  the  central  bank  changes  the  basic  interest  rate  or  reserve 
requirements)  by  changing  the  amount  of  provisions  and  also  the  solvency  (CAR).  When 
interest rates and reserve requirements increase/decrease, banks take less/more risks by means 
of  increasing/decreasing  provisions  and  become  more/less  solvent,  increasing/decreasing 
CAR.  Understanding  the  relationship  between  monetary  policy  and  financial  stability  is 
crucial to define new regulatory strategies, as well as more effective banking supervision. 

Moreover,  we  found evidence of an  important  side  effect due to  high  interest  rates.  The 
policy of high interest rates, which has been used in Brazil under inflation targeting for a long 
period,  caused  high  resilience  of  the  financial  sector  in  terms  o f  banking  solvency.  High 
interest  rates  mean  high  risk,  so  banks  react  with  more  spread  and  less  credit  supply  (in 
accordance  with  the bank  lending channel, as pointed out by Montes and Peixoto, 2014) and 
increase provisions and solvency (in accordance with the risk-taking channel). 

An important novelty of the study is the evidence found that there is no trade-off between 
provisions  and  CAR.  The  absence  of  this  trade-off  means  that  banks  react  in  the  same  way 
regarding provisions and solvency because these two aspects of banking strategy are related to 
the  same  aspect,  namely  banking  expectation.  Banking  expectation  is  a  forward- looking 
behavior  that  has  to  be  considered  when  formulating  banking  supervision  strategy.  This 
absence of trade-off suggests that a provision based banking supervision may not be effective 
producing  just  the  opposite  of  the  desired  outcome.  In  consequence,  a  better  coordination 
between monetary policy and banking supervision becomes necessary and recommended.
