In the 2000s, several Latin American economies, and Brazil in particular, have engaged in relatively 
successful attempts to combine higher economic growth and lower income inequality. As the Brazilian 
economy slowed down in more recent years, the sustainability of this growth model has been put into 
question.  After  studying  the  impact  of  different  redistributive  policies  (e.g.  minimum  wage,  income 
transfers)  on  the  personal  and  functional  distributions  of  income  in  Brazil,  the  paper  discusses  the 
response of aggregate consumption, investment and net exports – as well as the economy’s productive 
structure and inflation rate – to the changes in income distribution itself and other relevant factors. The 
analysis allows us both to draw lessons to the Neo-Kaleckian literature on demand regimes, pointing 
towards the importance of some theoretical extensions, and to examine future prospects for the Brazilian 
economy. 
 
Keywords: demand regimes, functional and personal income distribution, Brazilian economy.

1. Introduction 
 
A careful examination of the experience of Latin American economies since the early 2000s is long 
overdue, especially for economists interested on the relation between growth and distribution. After the 
protracted stagnation of the region that began with the sovereign debt crisis of the 1980s, only in the 
2000s Latin America was able to sustain economic growth for a longer period. The average annual GDP 
growth rate of the region from 1981 to 2000 was 2.36 per cent in real terms, while the world average 
was 2.99 per cent. From 2001 to 2013, the world average dropped to 2.56 per cent, whereas Latin 
America attained 3.13 per cent. Brazil was no exception to this trend: its average annual GDP growth 
rate went from 2.10 in the 1980s and 1990s to 3.28 from 2001 to 20132. But this was not merely a story 
of accelerating growth. In spite of remaining the region with the highest levels of income inequality in 
the world, Latin America went through a consistent process of inequality reduction, which started in the 
turn of the 1990s to the 2000s. And this happened at the same time that income inequality was growing 
everywhere else (Lustig et al., 2013; Palma, 2011). 
Such  a  regionally  homogeneous  experience  raises  the  suspicion  that  its  determination  might  be 
found  in  some  international  process  that  affected  Latin  America  as  a  whole.  One  of  the  main 
interpretations along these lines claims that the growth acceleration was a result of rapidly increasing 
world (especially Chinese) demand for the regions’ exports. This rising demand had a clear impact on 
the  prices  of  primary  goods,  as  evidenced  by  the  IMF’s  index  of  commodity  prices,  which  after 
remaining virtually flat from the early 1990s to the early 2000s increases markedly from 2002 onwards3. 
It is relatively uncontroversial that it represented a positive shock to the region’s economy. 
Examining some of the main Latin-American economies, however, it is plausible to argue that the 
explanation  for  their  performance  since  the  2000s  should  also  be  sought  in  the  domestic  policies 
implemented. It was also in the turn of the 1990s to the 2000s that candidates with a critical stance 
towards neoliberalism were elected in several of the region’s countries and their accession to power 
meant  a  shift  –  sometimes  gradual,  sometimes  abrupt  –  of  the  economic  policies  implemented.  It 
represented a relatively successful (and definitely new) attempt to combine higher economic growth 
with a reduction in income inequality. For this purpose, in the particular case of Brazil, the strategy of 
the first and second Lula governments (2003-2010) has been based on two main pillars. The first was 
the  expansion  of  the  mass  consumption  market  through  the  incorporation  of  previously  excluded 
working  families.  The  second  was  the  increase  in  public  and  State-induced  private  investment  in 
economic and social infrastructure.  
In order to achieve these two main goals, the government has made use of: (i) fiscal policy, having 
funded social transfers, minimum wage increases and higher spending in social housing, infrastructure, 
health and education, and (ii) an active credit policy, both via the development bank (BNDES), which 
financed  an  increasing  volume  of  private  investment  at  subsidized  interest  rates,  and  the  public 
commercial banks (Caixa Econômica Federal and Banco do Brasil), which mostly increased the supply 
of credit for housing and agriculture, but also provided consumer credit.4 
These policies were effective in reducing poverty rates, income inequality, and unemployment and 
in raising the labor share of income. The recovery from the crisis that began in 2008 was relatively fast, 
as  the  government  expanded  its  public  investment  and  credit  policies,  while  maintaining  social 
programs. However, what is more controversial was the success of the model in promoting a sustainable 
path of economic growth, especially after growth itself has fallen significantly since Dilma Rousseff 
started her administration in 2011. 
The objective of this paper is to examine the trajectory of the Brazilian economy since the early 
2000s,  emphasizing  the  interaction  between  economic  growth  and  income  distribution.

examination  will  resort  to  the  neo-Kaleckian  growth  and  distribution  model,  a  macroeconomic 
framework that seems especially suited to the task, since it places the question of distribution at its core, 
in contrast to most other frameworks. The goal will not be to build a model for the Brazilian case, 
however, but to use it as a standpoint from which the interaction of the variables will be analyzed. 
Further, the specificities of the case in hand will be used to raise questions on the assumptions and 
hypothesis of this literature, pointing out its limitations and suggesting routes for future research. By 
bringing together the neo-Kaleckian models and the recent trajectory of the Brazilian economy, we 
hope to contribute to the theoretical debate while examining the limits and possibilities of sustaining 
high economic growth and falling inequality in Brazil.  
The paper will be organized in five sections. After this brief introduction, the second section will 
summarize the redistributive and macroeconomic policies adopted in Brazil since the early 2000s and 
the  impact  they  had  on  income  inequality.  In  the  third  section,  we  will  discuss  the  trajectories  of 
aggregate consumption, investment, and net exports and the shifts in the productive structure, in light of 
the neo-Kaleckian models. Then, in the fourth section, an attempt will be made to draw lessons to this 
literature from the Brazilian case, pointing toward the need for a more complex understanding of the 
concept  of  demand  regimes.  Finally,  the  fifth  section  will  conclude  the  paper  examining  the  future 
prospects of the Brazilian economy. 
 
 
2. Economic policies and income distribution 
 
There is no denying that economic dynamics have distributional consequences. But the recent literature 
on inequality has been making increasingly clear that reducing it to a product of “economic factors” is 
seriously misleading, since large variations on inequality across the world seem to be mainly a result of 
institutional heterogeneity. In the words of Gabriel Palma (2011: 123), “political-institutional factors 
and the nature of the political settlement in the real world are likely to have a far greater influence on 
the determination of income distribution than purely economic factors.” While much has been made of 
Thomas Piketty’s (2014: 13-15) critique of the so-called Kuznets curve, according to which inequality 
first rises then falls during a process of economic development, one of the conclusions of Capital in the 
Twenty-First Century is that the differences in inequality across countries can be, to a great degree, 
explained by differing tax and labor market policies. 
With this mind, the present section will attempt to summarize the process of income redistribution 
that took place in Brazil in the last fifteen years by focusing on the policies implemented. It is clear that 
the growth process made an important contribution to the reduction of inequality, especially through 
increasing the bargaining power of workers. But economic growth was itself a result, at least partially, 
of redistributive policies. This interaction will be further discussed in the next two sections, while the 
present one will focus on the mentioned policies. 
 
2.1. Minimum wage  
 
Since price stabilization was achieved following the Real Plan in the mid-1990s, the minimum wage in 
Brazil has increased almost monotonically in real terms, having now come close to its pre-dictatorship 
2000s. This phenomenon was the result of a more active minimum wage policy in the Lula and Dilma 
governments, which eventually led to the creation of a strict policy rule, first established in 2011 and 
renewed in 2015, that guarantees that the nominal value of the minimum wage is adjusted every year to 
cover  not  only  the  yearly  inflation  rate,  but  also  the  GDP  growth  rate  observed  two  years  before. 
Further, the most striking feature of this process for those labor economists working in the neoclassical 

level5. Nonetheless, the average growth rate of the minimum wage, was much higher since the mid-
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

5 The military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985 implemented policies that substantially increased income 
inequality. One of them was a reduction in real terms of the minimum wage that would only start to be reversed in the mid-
1990s.

the national level6, the minimum wage is also used in Brazil as an index for public servants’ and rural 

tradition is that the fast rise in the minimum wage has been combined with a substantial increase in the 
rates of labor market formalization and a reduction in the unemployment rate. 
The repercussions of the rise in the minimum wage for the evolution of both the personal and the 
functional  distribution  of  income  have  been  the  subject  of  several  empirical  studies.  Before 
summarizing these results, it is important to point out that besides acting as the legal floor for wages at 
workers’  pensions,  as  well  as  for  several  social  security  programs,  thus  affecting  –  directly  and 
indirectly – the income levels of a large portion of the population. Indeed, the average wage has also 
substantially increased during this period, even if at a slower rate than the minimum wage (Figure 1). 
In this context, it is not surprising that the empirical evidence for Brazil has shown that increases in 
the minimum wage have not only shifted the wage distribution to the right, thus increasing the share of 
wages in total income, but have also changed the dispersion of wages, reducing wage inequality among 
the employed. In a recent study, which reproduces the decomposition techniques in DiNardo, Fortin and 
Lemieux  (1996),  Komatsu  (2013)  shows  that  the  rise  in  the  minimum  wage  has  contributed  for  a 
In order to distinguish the effect of the minimum wage policy on the functional distribution of 
income and on the size distribution of wages, it is useful to start from the following expression of the 

substantial reduction in the wage dispersion at the bottom of the distribution, between 2004 and 20117.

Even if these two factors have played opposite effects in (3), Figure 2 shows that the upward trend 
in the wage share has persisted in the most recent period, suggesting that higher employment growth 
had a more important role than the reduction in wage disparity since 2009. Figure 2 shows the evolution 
of the wage share, as well as three other measures of wage dispersion – the Gini index for labor income

and the ratios of the average salary at the bottom 10% to (i) the top 10% of the wage distribution, and 
(ii) to the median wage. What can be drawn from the joint observation of these indicators is that while 
the reduction in wage inequality in the bottom half of the distribution is still ongoing, the rise of lower 
wages relative to top salaries started to reverse since 2011, with the result being a tendency for the 
overall Gini index to stabilize. In other words, the faster growth of top salaries relative to lower wages 
may explain the stagnation of the minimum-to-mean wage ratio in recent years.  
2.2. The bottom and the top 
Even if the minimum wage policy was the main instrument of income redistribution, some income 
transfer programs played an important role and should not be overlooked9. Prominent among them is a 
conditional cash-transfer program named Bolsa Família10. Lena Lavinas (2013: 25-26) provides a good 
summary of it: 

 
 

“Initially  introduced  in  2003,  the  Bolsa  was  formally  established  by  law  in  January 
2004, during Lula’s first term. The programme aims to ensure a minimum monetary income 
to poor and indigent families (…). Rather than providing a single benefit, the programme 
has  flexible  parameters,  adjusting  the  amount  according  to  the  composition  of  recipient 
families. (…) In order to receive the monthly stipend, families are required to make regular 
visits to health clinics—aimed especially at pregnant or breastfeeding women, and children 
under five—and to ensure children between the ages of 6 and 17 have a minimum 75 per 
cent school-attendance record.”  

 
It can be argued that Bolsa Família is the culmination of a series of efforts that go back to the 
Brazilian Constitution of 1988 of creating a national system of social protection. In the mid-1990s, 
some municipalities started adopting conditional cash-transfer programs, soon followed by the Federal 
Government.11 Bolsa Família represented, thus, an immense effort of coordinating these initiatives and 
a successful attempt at expanding its reach to all Brazilian families considered poor (Soares and Sátyro, 
2009: 7-10)12. 
The coverage of the program increased from around 6.5 million families in 2004 to around 14 
million  in  2012,  stabilizing  at  that  level  since  then,  reaching  around  one  forth  of  the  Brazilian 
population13. Its budget size increased in tandem, from 0.23 per cent of the GDP in 2004 to 0.47 per 
cent in 2012, but it remains small compared to other social transfers (Dos Santos, 2013: 223). Although 
the program has widespread support and is defended across the political spectrum, it still has some 
weaknesses in its design. First, the value of benefits and the income eligibility criteria are not formally 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

9 Available estimates (Barros et al., 2010, Calixtre, 2014) suggest that about half of the fall of the Gini index observed in 
Brazil since the early 2000s was caused by the changed distribution of labor income. It is clear that the minimum wage 
policy played an important role in that. But the contribution of the minimum wage to declining inequality was not restricted 
to that, since by indexing pensions and other transfers it also contributed to reducing the inequality of non-labor income 
(Lustig et al., 2013: 136) 
10 For a detailed description of the program, including varied assessments of its impacts, see Campelo and Neri (2013). See 
also Soares and Sátyro (2009). A critical analysis in English of the recent surge of conditional cash-transfer programs, which

11 Conceptually, there was a shift from a social protection approach to conditional cash-transfer programs in the 1990s. The 
previous,  based  on  the  idea  of  solidarity,  sees  the  benefits  of  the  system  as  a  right.  The  latter  sees  the  programs  as 
instruments  to  stimulate  the  accumulation  of  human  capital  by  the  poor  and  tend  to  put  great  emphasis  on  the 
conditionalities. See Soares and Sátyro (2009) and Lavinas (2013). 
12 The actual lines of poverty and indigence (or extreme poverty) are periodically adjusted. Currently, households with a 
monthly per capita income below R$ 77,00 (roughly, $26 dollars) are considered indigent and those with income between 
R$77,00 and R$ 154,00 (roughly, $52 dollars) are considered poor.

indexed to any indicator of inflation. They have been adjusted periodically, but there is no guarantee 
that they will continue to be so. Second, its benefits are not considered a right and its transfers can be 
subject to budgetary restrictions, in contrast to unemployment benefits or pensions, for example (Soares 
and Sátyro, 2009: 11, 13). 
Such a targeted income transfer program has, of course, a direct impact on the level of income 
inequality. Most recent analysis of the distribution of the benefits shows that 50 per cent of the total 
value of Bolsa Família benefits go to the poorest 15 per cent of the households, while 90 per cent of it 
go to the poorest 45 per cent (Hoffmann, 2013: 209). It is much more progressive, in this sense, then the 
other federal transfers or the pension system. It is, however, difficult, given data limitations, to measure 
its specific impact on some indicator of inequality, like the Gini index. Consequently, most available 
studies  attempt  to  identify  the  combined  impact  of  government  transfers,  using  a  varied  array  of 
techniques and suggesting that a significant share of this total impact should be attributed to  Bolsa 
Família.  This  kind  of  estimate  has  been  repeated  periodically,  with  relatively  consistent  results. 
Government transfers seem to have been responsible for something between 17 and 40 per cent of the 
total reduction in the Gini index observed since 2003 (Barros et al., 2010; Hoffmann, 2013; Calixtre, 
2014).14 
Placing too much emphasis on the trajectory of an indicator like the Gini index and overlooking the 
dynamic of top incomes would mean, however, disregarding the important shift in the debate about 
income inequality stimulated by the publication of Piketty’s (2014) book. It is possible, according to 
this burgeoning literature, that the trajectory of inequality is biased by a synthetic indicator like the Gini 
index,  which  gives  a  small  weight  to  the  share  of  income  appropriated  by  the  richest  part  of  the 
population.  Moreover,  the  main  source  of  inequality  studies,  household  survey  data,  tends  to 
underestimate the income appropriated by the rich, biasing even further the analysis of inequality. 
Particularly in the Brazilian case, there are many reasons to suspect that this sort of bias is present 
in most of the inequality studies. First, different sources, like Census data, indicates that a much larger 
share of income went to the top percentile (around 18 per cent, instead of the 12 per cent found in 
household surveys, according to Dedecca, 2014) and that this share had remained stable from 2000 to 
2010.  Second,  the  growing  adoption  of  redistributive  policies  since  2003,  like  the  minimum  wage 
policy and the income transfer programs, were not accompanied by a significant transformation of the 
institutions that contribute decisively to the reproduction of inequality at its obscene level. The lack of 
reform of the tax system is a good illustration. Persistently high interest rates are another. 
Very  strong  evidence  that  these  suspicions  were  warranted  came  forth  in  the  summer  of  2014, 
when the first studies that had access to Brazilian tax data were published. Tax data is, of course, the 
main source of the top incomes literature that Piketty and his co-authors have been producing since the 
early 2000s and, despite its limitations, it is considered to be a more reliable source than household 
surveys. These studies on Brazil indicate that the share of income appropriated by the top percentile was 
even larger than the one calculated from Census data, oscillating around 25 per cent of total income, 
from 2006 to 2012 (Medeiros et al., 2015a). With the top percentile receiving one forth of total income 
throughout  this  period,  there  would  need  to  be  a  very  large  redistribution  of  income  within  the 
remaining 99 per cent of the population for inequality to fall significantly. An attempt to combine tax 
data with household survey data in order to calculate synthetic indicators of inequality suggest precisely 
that inequality has not fallen in this period (Medeiros et al., 2015b)15. 
These  results  are  still  too  recent  and  any  conclusions  derived  from  them  should  be  considered 
preliminary. The reasons for the stability of the share of income appropriated by the rich have not yet 
been  analysed,  but  a  few  hypotheses  can  be  formulated.  Rising  top  incomes  are  mostly  attributed, 
according to Piketty, to the fast accumulation of wealth allowed by high interest rates (higher than 
growth rates), to increasing salaries for top management and to the reversal of the progressive nature of 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

14 Their impact on poverty was much larger, but analyzing it is beyond the scope of the present paper. 
15 A study published in 2007 argued that household survey data might underestimate the level of inequality, but probably did 
not distort its trajectory (Barros, Cury and Ulyssea, 2007). With hindsight, this conclusion appears to have been overly 
optimistic.

the tax systems of some rich countries. While there are not many studies on top salaries in Brazil, there 
is abundant evidence that the Brazilian tax system is much less progressive than that of most countries 
(Silveira  et  al.,  2013;  Higgins  and  Pereira,  2014),  and  Brazilian  real  interest  rates  have  long  been 
considered a national idiosyncrasy, being much higher than everywhere else. Moreover, the share of 
income appropriated by the top percentile in Brazil’s largest and richest city, São Paulo, has increased 
from around 13 per cent to just over 20 per cent, between 2000 and 2010, according to Census data 
(Prefeitura de São Paulo, 2014: 4). This might be explained by the very steep increase in real estate 
prices observed in the last decade, something that may have contributed to the stability of top incomes. 
Be that as it may, it would probably be an overstatement to simply dismiss the earlier findings 
about falling inequality, given these recent results. The redistributive policies mentioned above and the 
consequences for the labor market of the higher economic growth observed in the second half of the 
2000s  certainly  entailed  a  reduction  of  the  dispersion  of  the  wage  distribution,  reducing  wage 
inequality. The trajectory of the functional distribution probably pointed in the same direction. And the 
effect of these changes for the labor market, for aggregate demand, and for the structure of the economy 
should not be disregarded. But the share of income going to those in the top of the distribution is so 
large that it overcasts these phenomena and it makes any attempt to reduce inequality without putting in 
question the structures that reproduce the power of the rich somewhat naïve. 
 
2.3. Macroeconomic policies 
 
As  will  become  clearer  in  the  next  two  sections,  a  brief  discussion  of  the  macroeconomic  policy 
framework implemented in Brazil during the past decade is also crucial for the understanding of a few 
aspects concerning the patterns of growth and distribution undergone by the Brazilian economy since 
2003.  
While the two Lula administrations (2003-2010) have broadly kept the so-called macroeconomic 
tripod based on inflation targeting, floating exchange rates and a high target for the primary surplus, 
Dilma Rousseff took over in 2011 and nominated a more dovish president for the Brazilian Central 
Bank. Even if real interest rates had been gradually falling since about 2005, they were still very high 
for  international  standards  before  2011,  helping  attract  capital  flows  and  leading  to  a  worrisome 
appreciation of the exchange rate16. In fact, as described by Barbosa-Filho (2008), the exchange rate 
was used as a nominal anchor for price stabilization since the implementation of the inflation-targeting 
regime  in  1999,  which  can  be  explained  based  on  the  well-known  obstruction  of  more  standard 
monetary policy channels in the country (Barboza, 2015).  
In the first year of Rousseff’s government, however, the Central Bank opted for a sharp reduction 
in the policy interest rate, which itself contributed to a strong devaluation of the Brazilian Real17. Going 
further, the government reduced interest rate spreads in public commercial banks, which passed over to 
the rest of the financial system through competitive pressures. At the same time, monetary authorities 
imposed macroprudential measures aiming at slowing down more risky credit supply.  
The policy shift was also clear in the fiscal stance. With the help of the commodity price boom and 
the high growth rates of the economy, the Lula government was able to increase public investment and 
other components of public spending while raising tax receipts and reducing sovereign (domestic and 
foreign) debt as a share of GDP. Rousseff, on the contrary, produced a 1% increase in the primary 
surplus in her first year, and stabilized the share of public investment in GDP throughout her entire 
administration. However, after growth decelerated, different attempts by the government to stimulate 
private  investment  led  to  a  substantial  deterioration  of  the  fiscal  stance  and  to  an  increase  in  gross 
public  debt.  Among  these  attempts  is  the  cut  in  payroll  taxes  –  first  in  a  few  industries  and  then

through traditional carry trade operations and arbitrage activities in the futures markets. 
17 The exchange rate to the dollar has devalued 45% in real terms between 2011 and 2014, a result not only of the decreasing 
interest  rates,  but  also  of  some  regulations  imposed  on  the  foreign-exchange  market  and  of  the  reducing  international 
liquidity following the aggravation of the crisis in Europe. See Cagnin et al. (2013).

extended  to  most  of  the  economy  –,  the  reduction  in  energy  tariffs,  and  the  transfer  of  high-yield 
Treasury bonds to the development bank for the provision of long-term financing at (lower) subsidized 
rates. Finally, while the substantial accumulation of international reserves throughout the entire period 
has helped monetary authorities in the absorption of shocks to the exchange rate18, this policy also had a 
fiscal cost, as these reserves yield a lower interest rate than the Brazilian treasuries issued to finance 
them.  
 
 
3. Growth and distribution in Brazil 
 
In order to examine in more detail the effects of this process of redistribution on the Brazilian economy, 
we will analyse some of the main components of aggregate demand before turning, in the next section, 
to the discussion of their interactions and the concept of demand regimes. 
 
3.1. Consumption, personal inequality, and household debt  
 
In  standard  neo-Kaleckian  growth  models  (Dutt,  1984;  Taylor,  1985;  Bhaduri  and  Marglin,  1990; 
Blecker,  2002),  aggregate  consumption  is  simply  a  function  of  current  income  and,  given  different 
saving  propensities  between  workers  and  capitalists,  of  the  functional  distribution  of  income.  Since 
workers  have  higher  average  propensity  to  consume  than  capitalists,  an  increase  in  the  wage  share 
increases consumption. Two main extensions have been proposed to this formulation, one relating to the 
personal income distribution and the other, to the role of consumption credit. Regarding the former, it 
has been suggested that shifts in it might also have an impact on consumption, even if the functional 
distribution of income is stable (Carvalho and Rezai, 2015; Palley, 2015). This result is explained by the 
fact that workers that earn relatively higher wages tend to have a propensity to consume lower than that 
of low-wage workers and, thus, reducing wage inequality can be shown to have a positive impact on the 
average propensity to consume19. 
The attempt to integrate consumption credit in the standard model is mainly a reaction to the fact 
that, in most rich countries, consumption has grown in the last decades despite an increasing profit 
share. The usual explanation given for this is that workers compensated stagnating wages by financing 
part  of  their  consumption  with  credit.  In  Aldo  Barba  and  Massimo  Pivetti’s  (2009)  words,  debt 
functions as a “substitute for wages.” The implications of integrating consumption credit into the neo-
Kaleckian models are still far from settled, but they mostly deal with the potential unsustainability of a 
growth trajectory based on increasing levels of household debt (Dutt, 2006; Setterfield, 2014; Ryoo and 
Kim, 2014). 
How  can  the  Brazilian  experience  of  the  last  decade  be  analysed  in  light  of  these  theoretical 
formulations? On the one hand, the fast growth of aggregate consumption observed in Brazil until 2010 
could be partly attributed to declining wage inequality, following Carvalho and Rezai (2015). Even if 
the Gini index has remained stable between 2006 and 2012 when tax data is used to calculate it (as 
argued by Medeiros et al., 2015b), a compression of the wage dispersion appears to be indisputable, as 
mentioned above. And there is clear evidence that the average propensity to consume is lower for high-
wage earners20. Moreover, an increasing wage share may have also stimulated aggregate consumption, 
as predicted by the standard model. 
Aggregate consumption growth, however, decelerated from 2011 onwards, falling faster than what 
could be explained by a deceleration of the fall of inequality. In order to understand what happened, one 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

18 The  Brazilian  Central  Bank  has  increasingly  made  use  of  exchange  rate  swaps  to  prevent  strong  devaluations  of  the 
Brazilian currency following the tapering of the FED quantitative easing policies and other shocks in international financial 
markets. 
19 Similar results can be found in Barba and Pivetti (2009) and Palley (2014a). 
20 Data  of  the  latest  consumer  expenditure  survey  in  Brazil  (Pesquisa  de  Orçamento  Familiar,  2009)  reveals  that  the 
propensity to consume over total income of the top income earners is 56%, relative to more than 100% at the lower income 
category and 84% in average.

needs to examine the trajectory of household credit. Household credit grew quickly between 2003 and 
2009 and very mildly from 2010 on. The fast growth in the first period was, of course, not due to rising 
inequality, as in rich countries. But rather it was a product of growth in income in itself, which allowed 
the incorporation of a large number of relatively poorer families into the credit market, something that 
could  be  conventionally  explained  as  a  process  of  decreasing  liquidity  constraint.  This  was  further 
stimulated by the gradual reduction of real interest rates, by an institutional measure that created, in 
2004, what has been named crédito consignado (a loan with repayments automatically deduced from 
the borrowers’ paycheck) and by the expansion of the lending by public commercial banks, especially 
since the 2008 crisis (Dos Santos, 2013: 194-195). 
In its turn, the deceleration of the growth of the household credit as a share of GDP, in 2010, can be 
partly attributed to some macroprudential policies adopted by the Brazilian Central Bank (Serrano and 
Summa, 2015). It might also have been the case that the level of indebtedness reached a level that 
discouraged further borrowing by household and more extension of credits by banks. In the words of de 
Paula, Modenesi and Pires (2015: 423): “Banks most likely became more reluctant to offer new credit 
because of a fear of nonperforming loans, which increased from a low of 4.5 percent (December 2010) 
to a peak of 5.9 percent in mid-2012. Households most likely became more reluctant to obtain new 
loans  because  of  their  increased  indebtedness.”  Econometric  evidence  suggests  that  aggregate 
consumption responds significantly to the household credit to GDP ratio (Schettini et al., 2012), as 
expected, and this deceleration of the growth of credit seems to be the main reason for decelerating 
consumption growth. 
There  is  another  potential  interaction  between  household  debt  and  inequality  that  is  rarely 
discussed. Given that a growing level of household indebtedness creates a growing flow of interest 
payments from debtors to creditors – except in the unlikely case in which the volume growth is entirely 
compensated by a continuously decreasing interest rate –, it is bound to have an impact on inequality, 
since debtors tend to be poorer than creditors. Examining the widespread increase in household debt in 
so-called middle-income economies (including Brazil), Paulo dos Santos (2012) argues that it might 
increase inequality and it is, thus, a “cause for policy concern.” In his words, these growing interest 
flows create an “expropriatory relationship between wage earning households and banking capital, atop 
traditional forms of capitalist exploitation” (2012: 10). A similar point is made by Barba and Pivetti 
(2009:  127),  who  maintain  that  household  debt  makes  the  flow  of  “actual  income  accruing  to 
capitalists” include also the “the interest that wage earners must pay on the loans they obtain.” 
It is not implausible that the reliance on increasing household debt for the expansion of aggregate 
consumption observed in Brazil might eventually play a part in reproducing the high level of income 
inequality, by helping increase the share of income appropriated by the rich. That does not mean, of 
course,  that  the  extension  of  credit  to  poorer  households  should  be  restrained,  since  it  allows  them 
access  to  several  consumption  products.  But  it  should  be  understood  as  a  temporary  measure  to 
compensate for the high levels of inequality, and the access to these products should eventually be 
guaranteed by continuously decreasing inequality, rather than by credit flows. Not to mention that part 
of the increase in household debt means simply a substitution of private for public provision of some 
products, in a deepening commodification that has questionable implications21. A good illustration of 
this point is the growing number of cars bought by resorting to credit, while public investment in public 
transportation has increased much less. 
 
3.2. Capital accumulation in a commodity-exporting economy 
 
In the standard Kaleckian-Steindlian investment function (see for instance Taylor, 2004), the decision to 
accumulate capital depends positively on an exogenous term, which may reflect the level of optimism 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

21 This substitution of private for public debt is a worldwide phenomenon that has been called “Privatized Keynesianism” by 
Colin Crouch (2009). See also Barba and Pivetti (2009), Lavinas (2013), and Streeck (2014).

or growth expectations by firms, on the degree of capacity utilization, and on the profit rate22, as defined 
by the ratio between the money flow of profits and the value of the existing capital stock. The effect of 
the process of income redistribution observed in Brazil on aggregate investment depends, then, on the 
size of its impact on the  degree of capacity utilization and on the profit share. Different assumptions 
about this effect will be discussed in the next section, after we examine the controversial issue of the 
relationship between the trajectory of the exchange rate and the decision to invest. 
A devaluation of the exchange rate may thus play a triple role for investment: it may raise net 
exports  by  giving  access  to  foreign  markets,  increasing  the  rate  of  utilization;  it  may  raise  profit 
margins, by allowing firms to adjust their mark-ups in a context of foreign competition, and it may 
reduce consumption and utilization through the negative effect on real wages23. It is also true, however, 
that  there  is  a  trade-off  between  taking  advantage  of  the  devaluation  to  gain  competitiveness  or  to 
increase profit margins, so that the two first channels may not play out fully at the same time. 
In the econometric study by Dos Santos et al (2015), investment in Brazil is shown to respond 
significantly to two main factors: (i) the real exchange rate, and (ii) commodity prices. The first effect 
came out negative in the estimations, meaning that rather than stimulating investment decisions through 
higher  foreign  demand  and  mark-ups,  a  devaluation  of  the  exchange  rate  tends  to  hinder  capital 
accumulation.  Notwithstanding  its  short-run  character,  this  result  generally  contradicts  the  open 
economy arguments for the existence of a profit-led growth regime in Brazil.   
Possible explanations for this evidence include balance sheet effects on firms holding foreign debt; 
an increase in the cost of imported inputs and capital goods; the use of the devaluation by firms to 
simply  maintain  profit  margins,  and  the  relatively  low  price-elasticity  of  net  exports.  Indeed,  most 
manufacturing  sectors  in  the  Brazilian  economy,  as  in  almost  all  developing  countries,  are  highly 
dependent on imported intermediary inputs, and particularly on capital goods, thus facing an increase in 
unit costs when the exchange rate devalues.  It is also true that the exchange rate appreciation combined 
with the increase in real wages has led to a compression of profit margins in several manufacturing 
sectors in the 2000s, as the only way to maintain competitiveness24. Finally, the last factor seems to be 
supported by econometric evidence presented in Dos Santos et al (2015), which shows a low response 
of both exports and imports to the exchange rate in Brazil – a result that is not very surprising given the 
economy’s  high  specialization  in  price-inelastic  primary  goods  and  its  reliance  on  imports  that  are 
almost absent from the domestic productive structure.  
Even if it can be argued that a much higher devaluation could have worked to give the access to 
foreign markets and foster the development of new sectors, while also allowing for an increase in profit 
margins, its inflationary impact and the resulting contractionary effects25 on consumption could have 
created  negative  demand  effects,  also  reducing  the  profit  rate.  In  other  words,  both  the  demand 
conditions and the initial level of the profit margin may matter for the outcome of any policy aiming at 
higher profitability and/or competitiveness. The existing trade-offs between increasing demand or the 
share of profits may also help explain the failure of the attempts by the government since 2012 to 
stimulate  investment  via  tax  cuts,  which  by  requiring  a  contraction  in  public  investment  and  other 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

22 In the so-called Post-Kaleckian specification introduced by Bhaduri and Marglin (1990), the profit rate is replaced by the 
profit share in the investment function, which allows for the the possibility of profit-led investment and growth regime, even 
when the level of aggregate demand is wage-led. 
23 These channels are studied by in Blecker (2010) in a neo-Kaleckian open economy model with conflicting claims, which 
yields the interesting result that an economy may be wage-led domestically and profit-led overall. The model developed in 
Oreiro and Araujo (2013) introduces the exchange rate directly in the investment function in a quadratic term, and present 
econometric evidence that the current level of the real exchange rate in Brazil is below the optimal.  
24 Evidence presented in Carvalho and Teixeira (2015) shows a reducing in profit margins in both traditional and more 
complex industries between 2000 e 2009. In this context, the devaluation of the exchange rate after 2011 in Brazil has 
caused firms to face a much more difficult trade-off, namely between taking advantage of the devaluation to gain some 
competitiveness, or increasing prices to recover previous losses in profit margin without gaining much competitiveness in 
foreign markets (Carvalho and Teixeira, 2015). 
25 The contractionary effects of devaluation in a Keynesian setup have been seminally studied in the paper by Krugman and 
Taylor (1978). 

11 

discretionary components of public spending in order to meet the fiscal target, have an ambiguous net 
impact on the average profit rate. 
Finally, the second component in the study by Dos Santos et al (2015) brings an additional element 
to  the  picture.  Higher  commodity  prices  seem  to  have  a  very  strong  positive  link  with  private 
investment  in  Brazil,  which  could  be  explained  in  different  ways  within  the  Kaleckian-Steindlian 
specification. Given the importance of commodities in the country’s production and export structure, 
higher  commodity  prices  may  be  capturing  the  impact  of  higher  demand  and  profit  margins  on 
investment  in  these  sectors,  with  repercussions  for  the  whole  industrial  structure.  Alternatively, 
commodity prices may be acting as a proxy for the expected growth in world demand, especially in 
China, thus fostering firms’ animal spirits. In either case, the recent fall in Brazilian investment and 
growth rates could have an external driver that goes beyond the contraction of world trade following the 
European crisis, namely the deceleration in Chinese demand for primary goods and the consequent fall 
in commodity prices since 2011. 
 
3.3. Productive structure, distributive conflict, and inflation 
 
When  it  comes  to  the  inflationary  character  of  the  process  of  income  redistribution  in  Brazil,  it  is 
noteworthy that  prices of services have  grown above the general consumer price index  since 2005, 
keeping the inflation rate above the target for several years in the past decade even with the recent 
slowdown in economic growth. Two main channels connecting the rise in the labor share of income to 
the higher inflation rate in service sectors can be at work.  
First, a significant increase in real wages and in the employment rate may lead to changes in the 
consumption pattern towards more demand for services, putting pressure on prices. This mechanism 
relates to the well-known Engel’s Law, being in line with the evidence presented in Kravis and Lipsey 
(1988) of a higher income-elasticity of services relative to a basket of tradable goods. Indeed, according 
to the data presented in a report by the Central Bank of Brazil (2011), the share of services in household 
consumption increases substantially from the bottom to the top of the income distribution in Brazil. 
Redistribution toward wages and the reduction in wage inequality can thus be seen as responsible for 
the increase in the share of services in GDP from around 66 to 69% in the past decade. However, in 
order for the higher demand for services to translate in a response of prices, there would be need for 
some kind of supply constraint, or slow response in production. 
Second, higher wages can be affecting inflation in services from the cost side. This hypothesis is 
strengthened by two main idiosyncrasies of the service sector. The first relates to its generally non-
tradable nature, which gives producers a higher power to set their desired mark-up, thus transmitting 
any rise in unit labor costs to prices. A second relevant factor distinguishing the service sector is its 
higher labor intensity. As seminally pointed out by Baumol and Bowden (1965), the costs and prices of 
goods with lower growth in labor productivity tend to increase faster than those with relatively fast 
labor productivity growth. Hence, not only due to the lack of foreign competitiveness, but also due to 
the higher labor-output coefficient and slower labor productivity growth, prices of the service sector are 
expected to respond more strongly to a rise in wages. 
Therefore, by working through the demand or the cost side, both mechanisms attribute a crucial 
role to the increase in average wages and to the reduction in wage dispersion for the acceleration in 
service inflation observed in the period. Distinguishing these channels can be quite a complex task, 
especially  as  the  tightening  of  the  labor  market,  which  was  also  caused  by  higher  demand  and  the 
increase in the share of labor-intensive services in GDP, is partially responsible for the rise in wages 
itself. Results arising from a disaggregated empirical study in Dos Santos et al (2014) suggest that cost 
pressures were more important in some sectors, while demand may have played a larger role in others. 
An aggregate econometric study presented in Carvalho and Giovanetti (2015) find a pass-through of 
around 20% from higher nominal wages to prices of services, and through the use of control variables 
for labor productivity or the output gap in the service sector, suggest that the cost channel has been 
more significant for the total impact.  

12 

What is probably more important than quantifying the role of these channels is to recognize that the 
process of income redistribution in a highly unequal economy creates additional challenges due to its 
impact on the productive structure, the dynamics of labor productivity and on the behavior of relative 
prices and the inflation rate. In particular, the shift in consumption toward services, a sector known for 
the slower gains in labor productivity, may tighten the distributive conflict affecting both the labor and 
the  goods  market,  thus  exacerbating  inflationary  pressures  and  contributing  for  the  lack  of 
competitiveness of manufacturing sectors.

4. Demand regimes? 
 
Having reviewed the recent trajectory of income distribution in Brazil and having examined its potential 
impacts on consumption, investment, and the productive structure, it is time to move to the task of 
bringing these pieces together in order to shed light in the debate on the growth model. From a demand-
driven  macroeconomic  perspective,  the  neo-Kaleckian  literature  distinguishes  between  two  possible 
demand (or growth) regimes in an economy, a wage-led and a profit-led one (Dutt, 1984; Taylor, 1985; 
Bhaduri and Marglin, 1990). The issue concerns the impact of the functional distribution of income on 
investment and on consumption. If the negative impact of a rising wage share on investment (through 
the profitability term of the investment function) is strong enough to compensate its positive impact on 
consumption (through the different saving propensities), aggregate demand will be profit-led. In the 
opposite case, it will be wage-led. In an open-economy context, if net exports are inversely related to 
the wage share (through the impact of the latter on competitiveness), there is a higher chance that the 
demand regime will be profit-led overall, even if it is wage-led domestically (Blecker, 2010). 
Given that, in Brazil, the wage share has risen since 2004 and that the growth rate has accelerated 
at least until 2010, it is not surprising that some would put forward the interpretation that the Brazilian 
economy is wage-led (Serrano and Summa, 2012b).26  More concretely, the higher rates of consumption 
and  investment  growth  achieved  between  2004  and  2010,  and  particularly  the  fast  recovery  of  the 
economy after the 2008 crisis, are interpreted as a proof of the success of a wage-led growth strategy 
coupled  with  other  expansionary  policies  (Serrano  and  Summa,  2012b).  This  position  questions  the 
widely held view that the recent Brazilian growth model was consumption-led, since in a wage-led 
demand  regime  consumption  and  investment  stimulate  one  another  instead  of  competing  among 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

26 As Blecker (2002) clarifies there is a difference between a demand regime and a growth regime. But, given the widespread 
presence of idle capacity (not only in Brazil), it is difficult to question that growth is crucially determined by aggregate 
demand. 

13 

themselves.27 And, in fact, the two components of aggregate demand have grown together in most years 
in the period, even if investment has larger fluctuations. Further, as Table 1 shows, the average growth 
of investment was higher than that of consumption in the period. After 2011, there was a deceleration in 
both  consumption  and  investment  growth,  with  investment  actually  falling  in  recent  years.  As  a 
consequence, the average growth rate in real GDP, which was 4.05% in the period 2003-2010, dropped 
to 2.14% in 2011-2014, and is expected to stay around -1.3% in 2015. 
This recent downturn, however, raised some questions to this interpretation, especially given the 
fact that the wage share has continued to increase after 2010 (at least until 2013, which is the last year 
for which there is data available). And it also opened the field to an alternative view, formulated by 
Bresser-Pereira and Gala (2008), Bresser-Pereira (2012), and Oreiro et al (2012). They claim that the 
distribution-led strategy based on the expansion of consumption has relied on foreign savings and the 
“chronic” appreciation of the exchange rate, which has itself led to a leakage of the higher domestic 
demand toward imports and the loss of competitiveness of manufacturing exports, and consequently to 
a process of deindustrialization with deterioration of the current account balance. According to these 
authors, the economic downturn post-2011 has signaled the failure of the wage-led, or the consumption-
led, growth model, with the solution being a strong devaluation of the exchange rate. The devaluation 
would help the recovery of profit margins and the access to foreign markets, which are both seen as 
essential  for  stimulating  investment  decisions.  Even  if  the  authors  do  not  use  this  particular 
terminology, it is not a stretch to read these interpretations along profit-led lines, as the argument only 
works  if  the  positive  effect  of  increasing  the  profit  share  on  investment  and  net  exports  more  than 
offsets the fall in consumption. Further, the contraction in real wages that would follow the devaluation 
is seen by the authors as temporary, as higher investment and productivity growth would lead to higher 
wages in the medium-run.  
The problem with the latter interpretation is that, as described in section 2.3, Dilma’s first term was 
marked  by  a  policy  shift  aiming  precisely  at  raising  profit  margins,  which  happened  through  the 
reduction of the policy rate and the interest rate spreads, the devaluation of the exchange rate, and cuts 
in payroll taxes and energy prices. If the demand regime was profit-led, one should expect all these 
measures aimed at boosting profitability to raise investment and aggregate demand. But, after growing 
from around 16 to 21 percent between 2006 and 2010, the investment rate stabilized from 2011 to 2013 
and fell in 2014. And economic growth, as already mentioned, decelerated. 
The  authors  that  defend  the  wage-led  demand  argument  maintain  that  this  deceleration  was 
precisely driven by the shift in the macroeconomic policy mix in a context of slow growth in the rest of 
the world, which followed the aggravation of the European crisis (see Summa and Serrano, 2012a; 
2015).  Moreover, the inflation rate, which in Brazil largely responds to exchange rate devaluations, 
also picked up during this period, slowing down real wage and consumption growth. In the absence of 
both  domestic  and  foreign  demand  injections,  the  subsequent  fall  in  investment  could  thus  be 
understood through the effect of a lower capacity utilization on the decision to accumulate capital in a 
wage-led economy. It is also true, however, that there was a monotonic increase in the penetration of 
manufactured imports between 2009 and 2014, as well as a deterioration of the current account during 
the entire period. Serrano and Summa  (2015) argue that the increase in imports are a consequence of 
the increase in the investment rate, rather the exchange rate appreciation28, thus neglecting the role of 
the external sector in the explanation of what they consider to be a policy-driven growth deceleration.  
It is not our purpose here to defend either of these views. It seems more interesting to examine the 
limits of both in order to question the concept of demand regime in itself. It is undeniably important to 
stress the relationship between income distribution and aggregate demand, but restricting the debate to 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

27 Dos Santos (2013: 183, fn. 4) has recently raised this point: “in a growing economy below full employment it is perfectly 
possible to simultaneously increase household consumption and the investment rate. It is not surprising, thus, that many 
critics of the growth strategy adopted since Lula’s government work, explicitly or implicitly, with the hypothesis that the 
Brazilian economy is (or was) operating at full employment – despite the fact that available evidence (for instance, falling 
unemployment year after year and low women participation rates) do not authorize this conclusion.”  
28 Indeed, Dos Santos et al (2015) and Padrón et al (2015) present econometric evidence of a relatively low price-elasticity of 
imports and exports in Brazil, respectively, using sectoral data. 
14 

the stark distinction between two mutually-exclusive demand regimes seems misleading. The analyses 
of  the  trajectory  of  consumption,  investment,  and  the  productive  structure  sketched  in  the  previous 
section point to relevant issues that are being abstracted in this debate between wage-led and profit-led 
regimes29. 
One of them is the issue of the personal distribution of income. As suggested above, the process of 
income  redistribution  taking  place  in  Brazil  has  both  raised  the  wage  share  and  reduced  wage 
inequality, changing the personal distribution of income. Carvalho and Rezai (2015) show that shifts in 
the  personal  distribution  of  income  can  raise  aggregate  demand,  even  in  the  case  of  a  profit-led 
economy. Bearing that in mind, one should not ignore the possibility that a crucial driver for growth 
acceleration until 2010 was precisely the change in the personal distribution of income, independently 
of the shift in the functional distribution. Further, this could also be behind the downturn after 2010, 
given that the fall in wage inequality has decelerated around that time30. Hence, a focus on the personal 
distribution of income, unduly relegated by most Kaleckian interpretations, sheds light on a particular 
important  development  that  may  partially  explain  the  acceleration  until  2010  and  the  following 
downturn. 
A  related  issue  concerns  the  non-neutrality  of  redistributive  policies.  By  taking  the  functional 
distribution  of  income  as  exogenous,  standard  neo-Kaleckian  models  rarely  examine  in  detail  the 
policies that could shift it. As stressed by Blecker (2010), however, different types of shock may have 
different effects on the components of aggregate demand and on longer-run growth in an open economy 
setup. As the author demonstrates, an exchange rate depreciation leading to a higher profit share plays a 
direct role for net exports, having different implications for aggregate demand than a reduction in the 
bargaining power of workers, for instance. In this context, it is also possible to conceive policies that 
would lead to a rising wage share, but that would have no (or little) impact on wage inequality, as may 
be the case of the exchange rate appreciation itself. If those were implemented, their only effect on 
aggregate demand would of course be through the functional distribution. But, if the shift in the latter 
was also, to a large degree, the result of a minimum wage policy, as seems to be the case in Brazil, then 
it  would  be  wrong  to  dismiss  its  simultaneous  impact  on  wage  inequality  and  the  higher  effect  on 
consumption spending arising from this channel. 
These considerations relate to a deeper critique recently made by Palley (2014b) to the numerous 
empirical attempts to identify countries’ demand regimes econometrically. As the author highlights, 
demand regimes may be endogenous and subject to policy influence. In particular, the policies that 
reduced the labor share of income in advanced economies over the past twenty years may have made 
these economies appear profit-led in some of these estimations, even if raising wages now would still 
produce a positive effect on capacity utilization and growth. This may also help explain the apparent 
contradiction between previous econometric results showing Brazil as profit-led overall (Araujo and 
Gala, 2012), and the achievement of higher rates of growth with an increasing wage share in the recent 
period. 
Another issue is the potential presence of non-linearities in the relationship between the functional 
distribution and aggregate demand, as highlighted in Taylor (2004) and Nikiforos and Foley (2012). 
Indeed, from a logical standpoint, it seems implausible that the growth rate of an economy would be 
maximized at a wage share equal to zero or 100%. The possibility that the response of investment to the 
profit share and/or of consumption to the wage share is non-linear could be important in understanding 
the contrast between 2004-2010 and 2011-2014. One hypothesis is that the rising wage share gradually 
squeezed profit margins to the point of leading to a switch in the Brazilian economy’s demand regime. 
Until 2010, wage-led demand prevailed, since the profit margins, despite falling, were still sufficiently 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

29  A  similar  classification  of  the  policy  debate  in  Brazil  opposes  so-called  new-developmentalists  and  social-
developmentalists. The former generally argue in terms of a profit-led regime, whereas the latter tend to spouse the wage-led 
interpretation. See Bastos (2012) and Mollo and Amado (2015). 
30 This is just a very preliminary hypothesis, since the data on the wage distribution is somewhat ambiguous and requires 
further investigation. It seems, in any case, that low wages went on catching up with the average wage until 2013, but the 
share of wages appropriated by the top wage earners increased and led to a stagnation of the index of wage inequality. See 
Figures 1 and 2. 

15 

large to encourage increasing investment. But around that time, profitability may have been squeezed 
down  to  a  level  in  which  firms  were  no  longer  willing  to  invest,  explaining  the  stagnation  of  the 
investment rate observed since 2011. According to this hypothesis, Dilma would have inherited from 
Lula an economy that, due to the ongoing process of income redistribution, had turned profit-led. 
Finally, there is the issue of the sectoral implications of growth and distribution, as illustrated by 
the  growth  of  services  and  the  related  acceleration  of  inflation,  examined  in  section  3.2  above.  An 
important limitation of most Kaleckian literature is its complete disregard for sectoral heterogeneity, 
due  to  its  overwhelming  reliance  on  single-good  models  (Steedman,  1992).  It  is  relatively 
uncontroversial that the manufacturing sector in Brazil is losing weight in the economy’s value added 
and employment, and it is, at least, puzzling that the dynamic implications of this process are of no 
concern to the authors in the wage-led camp.  
While the regressive specialization of the productive structure can be a very slow process, having 
started  in  Brazil  since  the  long  period  of  stagnant  domestic  demand  in  the  1980s  and  1990s,  an 
excessively  overvalued  exchange  rate  has  probably  not  helped  reverting  this  trajectory.  Even  if  the 
short-run  effects  of  an  exchange  rate  appreciation  may  be  positive  through  higher  real  wages  and 
investment (Dos Santos et al., 2015), while current exports and imports seem to be relatively price-
inelastic, its implications for the long-run productive structure are harder to assess31. Economic history 
of Brazil should at least make one aware of the risks of relying too much on exports of soy and iron ore. 
And the impact of a lower share of manufacturing on the potential of increasing labor productivity on a 
longer horizon should be a matter of concern. This does not mean, however, that an exchange-rate 
devaluation should be sought, as proposed by the economists in the profit-led camp, but maybe there 
should  be  an  effort  to  at  least  take  advantage  of  the  market-driven  ones,  rather  than  keeping 
skyrocketing interest rates for price stabilization purposes.  
This is far from an exhaustive discussion of the issues that are potentially relevant to examine the 
interaction between growth and distribution in Brazil. And all the hypothesis referred to above are very 
preliminary and each requires further investigation. But they may suffice, on the one hand, to make the 
point that a fruitful use of the Kaleckian models to shed light on particular historical developments must 
go beyond the simplification involved in the debate around the existence of stable demand regimes. 
And, on the other hand, they represent an attempt to suggest productive areas of extensions for this 
literature, drawing on the Brazilian case. The belief in the importance of this back-and-forth movement 
between abstract theories and concrete cases as a way of increasing our understanding of economic 
phenomena was the starting point of this exercise. 
 
 
5. Wither Brazil 
 
The  recent  shift  in  Brazilian  economic  policy  towards  austerity  is  endangering  the  combination, 
however fragile, of high economic growth and income redistribution that has been the object of the 
present paper. The impact of the present recession in the labor market has been astounding, reversing 
part of the gains, in terms of wages and employment, obtained in the last decade. But, if we are allowed 
a glimmer of hope, this process has had at least the benefit of stimulating several interpretations of the 
recent  past,  allowing  the  debate  to  reach  a  more  sophisticated  level.  Besides  suggesting  potentially 
fruitful areas for further theoretical research, this paper has intended to give a modest contribution to 
this debate around the recent trajectory of the Brazilian economy. And we see this contribution less as 
an alternative interpretation in itself, but as a critical reflection on the available ones.  
Both  of  them  appear  to  be  unduly  optimistic.  The  first  suggests  that  a  continuing  process  of 
redistribution towards wages would in itself guarantee higher rates of growth, an auspicious view that 
began to be questioned in the theoretical Kaleckian literature in the 1990s. The second points out to a 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

31 The  different  time  horizons  in  the  response  of  the  different  components  of  aggregate  demand  to  changes  in  income 
distribution  have  also  been  the  subject  of  recent  criticism  by  Blecker  (2015)  to  the  standard  neo-Kaleckian  theory  and 
applications. 

16 

contradiction between redistribution and international competitiveness, but tries to avoid the issue by 
arguing that an exchange-rate devaluation would only mean a reduction of real wages in the short run. 
Given the race to the bottom promoted by trade globalization, this seems unlikely. 
While we have shown that redistributive policies have been effective in increasing the wage share 
and  reducing  wage  inequality,  accelerating  both  consumption  and  investment  growth,  the  view 
suggested  here  implies  that  this  process  may  have  created  new  obstacles  to  the  success  of  the 
distribution-led strategy in the long-run. And only a more careful investigation of each of the policies 
and of its impacts on each of the components of aggregate demand can clarify the nature of these limits 
and contradictions, so that they can be dealt with. 
If the policy of increasing the minimum wage seems to unambiguously increase the wage share and 
reduce  wage  inequality,  thus  stimulating  consumption,  for  instance,  it  might  have  an  impact  in  the 
productive structure that could limit the capacity of the economy to continuously increase productivity, 
which can itself exacerbate the distributive conflict and accelerate the inflation rate. The use of strategic 
industrial  policy  and  more  horizontal  productivity-enhancing  policies  (e.g.  public  investment  in 
infrastructure) seem to be one way around these issues.  
The extension of household credit is another example. Even though it allows the acceleration of 
aggregate  consumption  growth,  it  might  eventually  complicate  the  reduction  of  inequality  while 
increasing  financial  fragility.  A  third  example  would  be  the  exchange-rate  policy.  Its  appreciation 
brings down inflation and might even increase aggregate investment in the short-run. But, through time, 
its impact on the degree of competitiveness of manufacturing goods may inhibit a higher diversification 
of  the  productive  structure.  Moreover,  the  high  interest  rates  required  for  keeping  the  currency 
appreciated may be preventing deeper changes at the top of the income distribution. Last but not least, 
any attempt to keep reducing inequality while creating more fiscal space for social policies and public 
investment should involve a deep reform of the Brazilian tax system, mainly through raising taxes on 
property,  inheritance,  financial  wealth  and  top  incomes,  all  of  which  are  currently  very  low  for 
international standards.  
The so-called golden age of developmentalism, in the 1950s and 1960s, is for too long buried in the 
past for us to think that inclusive development is an objective technically easy to attain. But because it 
remains our normative horizon, it requires us a more critical engagement with the policies available.
