ABSTRACT

Given the recent discussions that address the theme of ﬁscal federalism and its importance
in the socio-economic development, this article has the main objective of analyzing the
relationship between ﬁscal decentralization and growth rate of the Brazilian states GDP. To
this end, in addition to the control variables used, 4 variables of ﬁscal decentralization were
constructed. The estimation was made from a dynamic panel template for the 27 Brazilian
states, comprising the period from 1995 to 2014. As a result, evidence shown that ﬁscal
decentralization has a positive relationship with the economic growth rate of the country.
Thus, it is possible to infer that public policies aimed at greater ﬁscal independence of
sub-governments might be of great importance to the socio-economic development of
Brazil.

RESUMO

Dadas as recentes discussões que abordam o tema do federalismo ﬁscal e a sua importância
no desenvolvimento socioeconômico, este artigo tem como objetivo principal analisar
a relação entre a descentralização ﬁscal e a taxa de crescimento do PIB dos estados
brasileiros. Para tanto, além das variáveis de controle utilizadas, foram construídas 4
variáveis de descentralização ﬁscal. A estimação foi feita a partir de um modelo de painel
dinâmico para os 27 estados brasileiros, compreendendo o período de 1995 a 2014. Como
resultado, foram encontradas evidências de que a descentralização ﬁscal possui relação
positiva com a taxa de crescimento econômica do país. Assim, é possível inferir que
políticas públicas que visem maior independência ﬁscal dos sub-governos podem ser de
grande importância para o desenvolvimento socioeconômico brasileiro.

1 Introduction

Over the past few decades, numerous countries have changed their institutional settings,
as a form of allocating more political power and ﬁscal autonomy to subnational governments.
According to Oates (1972), the basic argument in favor of such decentralization is that it improves
the efﬁciency of the public sector and promotes long-term economic development.

The seminal works of Samuelson (1954) and Samuelson (1955) on the economic theory
of decentralization and the works of Tiebout (1956) and Oates (1972) served as the basis for
the creation of the economic theory related to the federal tax. Tiebout (1956), in his model of
“voting with the feet” put forward the idea of decentralization, arguing that the existence of a
decentralized government would facilitate the mobility of families between regions, and thus,
given their preferences and the utility, these families could choose the regions where the public
supply of goods and services would ﬁt in their baskets of goods.

The initial idea of Oates (1972), known as the “ﬁrst generation”, argues that ﬁscal
decentralization increases the public sector efﬁciency because subnational governments are best
acquainted with the local conditions and preferences and, thus, achieve a better provision of
public goods, due to their physical and institutional proximity. In addition, Oates (1999) argues
that higher levels of ﬁscal decentralization can achieve higher levels of social well-being. For if
the demands for public goods are different, equal levels of public goods and services offered by
a national government will be inefﬁcient. Thus, the greater the demand for public goods, the
greater the beneﬁts of ﬁscal decentralization. This diversiﬁcation also allows the citizens to move
to communities that better match their demands for public goods and services, and rates of local
taxes. Thus, the “screening of individuals of Tiebout” increases the efﬁciency of subnational
governments in the allocation of its resources.

But how does the ﬁscal decentralization affects economic growth? According to the
theory of ﬁscal federalism, subnational autonomy ensures efﬁcient allocative results, which can
result in higher rates of economic growth ((TIEBOUT, 1956), (OATES, 1972)). Or as Brueckner
(2006), in a similar way, more ﬁscal autonomy may be associated with higher levels of product
per unit of labor, and higher rates of growth.

The relationship between ﬁscal decentralization and economic growth, however, is quite
complex. In recent years, many studies have tried to test the effect of decentralization on the
growth of the economies and, despite the widespread theoretical recognition of this effect, few
have succeeded in proving this relationship.

Davoodi e Zou (1998) using panel data for 46 countries for the period 1970-1989, me-
asured the sub-national ﬁscal decentralization as a sub-local part of the total expenditure of
the government. The authors found a negative relationship between ﬁscal decentralization and
economic growth for developed countries and no relation for Developing Countries. Ezcurra e
Rodríguez-Pose (2011), using data from 21 countries in the Organization for economic coope-
ration and development (OECD) for the period 1990-2005 and controlling not only the ﬁscal
decentralization but also the political and administrative decentralization, found evidence for a
signiﬁcant negative association between ﬁscal decentralization and economic growth. In this
same downside, Baskaran e Feld (2013) tested this relationship using the regular indicators of
State Finance Statistics (GFS) and a new indicator, based on Stegarescu (2005), for 23 OECD
countries. For the usual indicators, the work found negative, but insigniﬁcant, effects of ﬁscal de-
centralization on economic growth. For the new indicators, the results found were also negative,
but, this time, statistically signiﬁcant.

Among the studies that ﬁnd positive evidence for the relation in question is the study
of Akai e Sakata (2002). Using data from 50 U.S. states for the period 1992 to 1996, the

authors tested the effect of ﬁscal decentralization on economic growth through 4 decentralization
measures: the indicator of revenue, production, autonomy, and production-recipes. The study
provided evidence that decentralization contributes to economic growth, suggesting that recent
movements by developed countries toward ﬁscal decentralization can stimulate their economic
growth. Gemmell, Kneller e Sanz (2013) found out, using data of 23 OECD countries in the
period 1972-2005, that the decentralization of spending tends to be associated with less economic
growth, while the decentralization of revenue has been linked to greater economic growth.
Filippetti e Sacchi (2016), at last, examined the relationship between ﬁscal decentralization and
economic growth in different institutional contexts, for 21 OECD countries for the period 1970-
2010. The authors found evidence that the decentralization of the property tax leads to greater
economic growth when it is associated with high administrative and political decentralization.
Numerous reasons may explain the controversial results found in the empirical literature. For
example, according to Voigt e Blume (2012), the institution can be very complex, and not be
fully observed. Or, still, such as Salmon (2013) points out, the heterogeneity of the jurisdiction
can be difﬁcult to be captured or, simply, as Filippetti e Sacchi (2016) point out, the political
and administrative dimension is not properly considered. It is important to emphasize also that
another reason may be related to the conﬁguration of how some forms of decentralization affect
economic efﬁciency by distorting the efﬁcient allocation of resources ((MARTINEZ-VAZQUEZ;
LAGO-PEÑAS; SACCHI, 2017)). Finally, and perhaps the best explanation for the fact is that
the studies use different data, technique, and speciﬁcations of decentralization, which produces
divergent results.

In addition to the academic context, the ﬁscal decentralization is a topic that has been
much discussed in political and economic debates on the worlds scenario. In recent decades,
ﬁscal decentralization has been used as a means for economies to achieve higher economic
efﬁciency. In fact, such speech of efﬁciency was used by countries such as the United States,
China, Great Britain and Spain as justiﬁcation for their movement of decentralization.

With the 1988 Federal Constitution, Brazil has experienced a movement of decentra-
lization, in the sense of delegate to the federated entities the responsibility to formulate and
implement public policies, focusing on the particularities of its local demands. Thus, there
was a distribution of administrative functions among the three levels of government. With this,
states and municipalities began to be able to deploy and make use of your taxes, aimed at the
regional and local development. However, given the heterogeneity of the country and the great
inequalities in its different regions, decentralization hasn’t presented the effectiveness expected,
causing tax wars and increases on the regional inequalities.

In this manner, which justiﬁes the present analysis for the Brazilian economy, in the sense
of investigating whether state governments with the highest levels of ﬁscal decentralization have
higher rates of growth, or, still, if there is a positive and signiﬁcant relationship between these two
variables. Thus, in order to investigate what are the effects of the recent ﬁscal decentralization on
the economic growth of Brazil, we use data for the 27 states of Brazil, in the period from 1995 to
2014.

Nevertheless, the work is divided into 6 parts, including this Introduction. In the second
section, there will be a brief overview of the process of ﬁscal decentralization in Brazil is made,
as well as are presented some recent data related to the subject. In the third section are presented
the methodological aspects, the article-basis, and calculation of the indicators. In the fourth part
will be presented the results of decentralization, along with the econometric estimation in the
ﬁfth part. At last, will be presented in the ﬁnal considerations, and the bibliographical references.

2 Brazilian situation of federalism and economic growth

The phenomenon of ﬁscal decentralization is characterized by budgetary autonomy and
collection of the federated entities, beyond the partition of taxes, government transfers and public
spending between federal, State and Municipalities.

Since its colonial period, Brazil was managed in a central way. Even after the proclama-
tion of the republic, the central government still had power over the administration of resources
for the implementation of state activities. From the decade of 1930, however, after a signiﬁcant
expansion of the public function, the federal government began to share some of the ﬁnancial
resources and administrative capacity with the other government levels (state and municipal).
During the military regime (1964-1985), and especially after the Constitution of 1967, the
concentration of ﬁscal resources, the generation of ﬁnancial resources and the formulation of
public policies was expanded by the federal government, signiﬁcantly reducing the autonomy of
subnational governments.

From the 1980s, as a result of this concentration of resources in the Union, enforced by
the dictatorship, a series of conﬂicts between the federal government, states, and municipalities
began. Based on that, during the process of redemocratization of the country, the movement of
Brazilian decentralization aimed at strengthening the political and ﬁnancial aspects of the states
and municipalities. With the 1988 Federal Constitution, all Brazilian federation was recreated, as
well as its structure, purpose, and fundamentals. However, as indicate Giambiagi e Além (2008),
since the Brazilian decentralization process was not conducted by the central Government, but
by States and mostly by municipalities, there was not a national plan for decentralization, which
resulted in an uncoordinated process.

Decentralization in Brazil is a complex process since the country is characterized by
severe socioeconomic and geographic inequalities, which are reﬂected in different capacities.
The conciliation between decentralization and the reduction of social inequalities, therefore, is
the main challenge to decentralization. Knowing that, in Brazil, this process is more related to
participation in the national transfers than the increase of its tax and revenue capacity. Table 1,
below, shows the distribution of average earnings for county and state according to the major
regions of Brazil, for the period of 1985 to 2014:

Analyzing the tax revenues, based on the information contained in Table 1, it is possible
to notice that the municipalities and Brazilian states showed a signiﬁcant change in their collected
values. When compared to the values before the Federal Constitution of 1988, the municipal
tax revenues showed growth in four of the ﬁve Brazilian regions, particularly the north and
northeast regions, with variations of 112% and 61%, respectively. As for the state tax revenues, is
highlighted the performance of the northern regions (145%) and the center-west (50%). However,
in the period from 1995 to 2014, despite these variations, the total of shares of tax revenues in
state and municipal revenues remained at similar levels – and sometimes even lower than the
beginning of the period. Although the existing tax revenue tends to grow, this is connected to the
increasing ﬁnancial dependency of subnational governments.

With regard to transfer revenue, the observed scenario is different. We can see that in
1985, the current transfers of the Brazilian municipalities accounted for about 60% of the total
municipal revenue, while in the ﬁnal period of the analysis (2011-2014), these accounted for
68%. However, by observing in detail the major regions, it is possible to notice much more
signiﬁcant variations. Furthermore, it is possible to notice also that in the regions northeast and
north, the less developed, there is a greater weight of current transfers. In these regions, the
weight of transfers passes the 80% level, while in the southeast region, the participation is about
60%. As for the states, the portion related to the tax revenue remained constant from 1985 to the
period of 2010-2014, in spite of small variations.

When comparing such results with the tax revenues, it is possible to notice an inverse
relationship: the concentration of tax revenues in the more developed regions is counterbalanced
by a system of transfers of taxes, which favors mainly the less developed regions.

It is known that the majority of municipalities do not possess an own revenue able to
sustain their demands. Nevertheless, the Brazilian municipal own collection has experienced
signiﬁcant growth during the period in question, as shown in Figure 1 below:

Figure 1 – Evolution of average municipal own collection - 1995-2014 - R$ million.

worked by the research.

In the period between 1995 and 2014, the growth of municipal own revenue was rather
fast. It is possible to notice, however, that from the second half of the last decade, the average
level of the municipal collection began to show less signiﬁcant variations, suggesting a possible
stabilization. By analyzing the expenditure side, Figure 2 shows the expenditure by level of
Government to Brazil, in the period of 1995 to 2014:

Figure 2 – Expenditures by level of government in Brazil - 1995-2014 - %.

Source: Own elaboration based on data from the National Treasury Secretariat.

Through the Figure 2 is possible to notice that in the initial period, 1995, the federal
government controlled approximately 71% of aggregate expenditure, while state and municipal
governments controlled about 20% and 9%, respectively. In 2014, the share of federal govern-
ment expenditure was 56%. While the share of state governments was approximately 27%

and, ﬁnally, the expenses of the municipal governments accounted for about 14% of the total.
Therefore, we can notice a change in the sizes of state and local governments, reﬂecting a trend
of decentralization in the sense that the sub-national expenditure increased its relevance in the
total. However, it is important to be careful, once the concept of decentralization is quite complex
and includes numerous other dimensions.

Regarding economic growth, the scenario observed for Brazilian regions is quite similar.

In the period in question, the nominal rates of growth of the Brazilian regions were
elevated, reaching levels higher than a dozen. It is clear, however, that the most signiﬁcant
variation occurred in the period of 1999-2002, where the northern region recorded the highest
rate of nominal growth – around 17%. At the end of the period, the Northeast region presented
the greatest variation.

3 Methodology

3.1 Measuring decentralization

Although the ﬁscal decentralization is a subject quite discussed in political and scientiﬁc
spheres, there is still no consensus among which quantitative measures are really suitable for the
measurement of the process. In order to make this empirical work interpretable and consistent
with previous studies, our analysis will be based on the study of the Akai e Sakata (2002).

It is common for ﬁscal decentralization to be interpreted as the delivery (or return)
of authority to a subnational government. Thus, to measure the decentralization, one should
know the degree of decentralization or, in other words, the level of authority of subnational
governments. However, it is difﬁcult to quantitatively measure such authority.

The most used approach measures the autonomy of these entities from its revenues
or expenses. However, some exceptions should be made. The expenditure of subnational
governments may be ﬁnanced by transfers from higher governments and, thus, the share of the
lower government expenditures in total expenses do not reﬂect necessarily the level of authority
of the smaller government. In addition, even if the portions of revenue or expenses are small, the
subnational government may be considered ﬁscally decentralized provided that the sufﬁcient
resources for the expenses of this government are originally allocated to it. Therefore, it is
important that the level of autonomy be used as a proxy for ﬁscal decentralization.

However, as mentioned, several previous studies have used portions of the subnational
revenue and expenditure as indicators of ﬁscal decentralization. Since it is difﬁcult to develop a

single completely satisfactory measure, we considered four measures of ﬁscal decentralization,
such as Akai e Sakata (2002), that deal with the reservations above and include different points
of view. Our four indicators are detailed below:

i. Revenue Indicator (RI): deﬁned for each subnational government as the partici-
pation of each local revenue in the total revenue (the sum of all local revenues);
ii. Production Indicator (PI): deﬁned for each subnational government as the par-
ticipation of local expenditure in the total expenditure (the sum of all local
expenses);

iii. Autonomy Indicator 1 (A1): set for each subnational government as the portion
of its own revenue in the total revenue, excluding transfers. This indicator gets
closer to the true ﬁscal independence of subnational government;

iv. Autonomy Indicator 2 (A2): deﬁned for each subnational government as the
portion of its own revenue in its total revenue. This indicator gets closer to the
real independence of subnational government.

3.2 Empirical strategy

With the purpose of addressing the endogeneity in the models, the estimation used
was the one proposed by Arellano e Bond (1991), using instrumental variables from lags
of the endogenous variable in differences. The estimator Arellano-Bond is constructed by the
application of the ﬁrst difference to remove the effects of the level of the panel and use instruments
to provide conditions of momentum. In this way, it becomes possible to accommodate large
self-regressive parameters and large proportions of the variance in the effect of level of panel to
the variance of the error idiosyncratic.

The model used has adjusted the dynamic data estimators panel from the estimator
Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond which was designed for data with many panels and few periods,
assuming that there is no autocorrelation in the idiosyncratic errors and does not require the
initial condition that the independent variables do not have a correlation with the ﬁrst difference
of the ﬁrst observation of the dependent variable.

In this way, the estimator of Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond displays the estimated model

in the following way:

p(cid:88)

yit =

αjyit−j + Xitβ1 + witβ2 + vi + it,

i = 1, 2,··· , N t = 1, 2,··· , Ti

(1)

j=1

Where,
aj are the p parameters to be estimated,
xit is a 1 k1 vector of strictly exogenous covariates,
β1 is a k1 1 vector of parameters to be estimated,
wit is a 1 k2 vector of predetermined or endogenous covariates,
β2 is a 1 1 vector of parameters to be estimated,
vi are the effects on the level of the panel (which may be correlated with the covariates),

is independent, identically-distributed over the whole sample with variance σ

and

From Akai e Sakata (2002) and with some adaptations, the regression model of this work

p(cid:88)

j=1

αjyit−j + Xitβ1 + witβ2 + vi + it,

i = states t = years

(2)

can written as:

LnGDPi,t−LnGDPi,t−1 =

∆RealGDP =

p(cid:88)

j=1

αjyit−j + Xitβ1 + witβ2 + vi + it,

i = 1,··· , 27

t = 1995,··· , 2015

(3)

Where i refers to state i to the quantities of year t; lnGDPit represents the natural
logarithm of the real GDP of each state i in year t, so that the left side of the equation represents
the rate of growth of the GDP of each state i in year t; the inside of the model wit represents
the endogenous indicators of ﬁscal decentralization and Xit the exogenous variables, both
represented for each state i in year t; ﬁnally, vi are the effects at the level of the panel and εit is
the error term.

3.3 Variables

The characteristics of the variables used are summarized in Table 3 below. The data 1
are of annual frequency, covering the period between 1995 and 2014, where the rate of growth
of GDP is the dependent variable of the model. All variables, including the indicators of
decentralization, have been transformed in natural logarithms.

Firstly, in relation to the four indicators of ﬁscal decentralization used, it is expected that
they contribute to the economic growth, as stated by Oates (1972), showing a positive effect on
the dependent variable. The data used for the construction of indicators were obtained through
the Secretariat of the National Treasury.

The education variables, degree of trade openness, Gini index, population, life expectancy
and occupied population were inserted in the model as control variables. According to the existing
literature, it is possible to make some predictions about some of these variables. For education,
we expect a positive effect, since the proxy variable used is the average years of study, and higher
levels of this rate lead to higher levels of qualiﬁcation and, thus, of economic activity.

Is expected that a higher rate of life expectancy of newborns will affect positively on
the growth rate, since a better quality of life implies a greater general life expectancy and,
consequently, an increase on the contribution in the labor market.

To the degree of trade openness, it is expected that this will contribute positively to
the dependent variable. As for the Gini index, given that higher values of the coefﬁcient
indicate higher levels of income concentration, it is expected that the effect of this variable on
the dependent variable is negative. Finally, for the population and the employed population,
the expected effect is also positive, given that models often point out that the population that
contributes to economic growth.

The data used in the construction of indicators of ﬁscal decentralization have been
collected through the National Treasury Secretariat (STN), while the Gini Index, years of
study, the population and the employed population were obtained from the Brazilian Institute

1 When necessary, the collected data have been deﬂated as the literature recommends.

3.4 Preliminary Analyzes

Prior to the estimation, there will be a description of the data. In this regard, the maps
contained in Figures 3 and 4 below show the data relating to indexes of autonomy used in the
study. The maps present the initial and ﬁnal year of study, 1995 and 2014, respectively.

In Figure 3 we have the scenarios relating to the revenue and production indicators.
Firstly, on analyzing the revenue indicator, RI, it’s clear that the situation of the states has hardly
changed over the years, with Paraná being the only state who has changed its index, increasing it.
However, when analyzing the production indicator, PI, it’s evident that the scenario during the
period remained the same.3
2 For the census years, the data were collected through the Demographic Census.
3 This analysis ignores the small changes in the indicator’s values, considering only its leveled distribution.

Nevertheless, for the autonomy indicators 1 and 2, the scenarios are different, as Figure
4 shows. The left side of the ﬁgure, regarding A1, shows that many states have become more
ﬁscally decentralized, seeing that in the year 2014 many had darker colors – demonstrating the
highest level of the index. Despite this, there was a reduction of decentralization of other states,
such as perceived for the region north and center-west. Finally, the scenario A2, shown by the
right side of the ﬁgure and the index closer to real independence, shows that, in general, there
was a reduction of the indexes for the Brazilian states, since the highest levels are found in the
regions southeast and south.

That being said, the next important step is to analyze the correlation between the indicators
of decentralization, the explanatory variables, proxies of ﬁscal decentralization, and economic
growth, the dependent variable. Figure 5 below presents, for the study period, the average rate of
GDP growth associated with the four indexes of decentralization used in this work:

With the exception of the indicator A1, the simple linear association between economic
growth and the autonomy indexes seems to show the existence of a negative relationship between
the degree of ﬁscal decentralization and the economic growth of Brazilian states in the period
from 1995 to 2014. In fact, the levels of correlation found for the indicators IR, IP and A2 were
-0.0902, -0.0855 and -0.0192, respectively, conﬁrming this impression. To the only positive
relationship found, the correlation coefﬁcient was equal 0.0408.

However, the intuition provided by Figure 5 should be treated with caution, since it is
well known that economic growth does not depend exclusively on the degree of decentralization
of the economy and the possible variables omitted may be inﬂuencing the negative relationship
observed.

Having that in mind, in order to test the real importance of ﬁscal decentralization on
economic growth of Brazilian states, we estimate the model presented in Equation 3 and we
present their main results in the following section.

4 Results and discussion

Recently, the effect of the taxation enforcement on economic growth has been the subject
of empirical studies, so that the issue became the focus of debates about possible government
reforms. In order to contribute to the discussion, the present work uses four types of indicators
that measure ﬁscal decentralization, in addition to control variables, to try to understand the
relationship between decentralization and economic growth of Brazilian states.

In table 4 was presented the relationship between the variables studied in the article.
The results represent the results obtained from the Stata software for the estimation of the
data model in a dynamic panel (GMM). Within the estimates, the variables for education,
population, employed population, Gini index, degree of trade openness and life expectancy were
considered exogenous to the model. While the variable of ﬁscal decentralization was considered
to be endogenous. All independent variables are in natural logarithm, so the coefﬁcients are
interpreted in elasticity.

Using instrumental models with a lag in the dependent variable, we have as a result that
the speciﬁcation test indicated that there was no residual correlation of second order and that the
instruments are valid for all the estimated models.

According to the results presented in the table above, the main ﬁnding of this study is due
to the fact that the indicator of ﬁscal decentralization A2 is positive and statistically signiﬁcant
to the economic growth of the states in the period analyzed, knowing that the Equation 1.4 is
signiﬁcant for measuring the effect proposed. The A2 positive sign shows evidence that a greater
ﬁscal autonomy represents a higher growth rate. This result is consistent with the ﬁndings of
Akai e Sakata (2002), which show that ﬁscal decentralization contributes to economic growth.

With regard to the control variables, the variables related to openness and trade and years
of study presented themselves as signiﬁcant and exerting a positive effect on the growth rate
of GDP of the states. Such ﬁnding agrees with the results found by Rodríguez-Pose e Ezcurra
(2010), in which the authors found the same effects for the variables of human capital and trade
openness. Filippetti e Sacchi (2016) found the same result for the trade openness, highlighting
the positive effect of this variable on the growth of the economies. In relation to years of study,
Cantarero e Congalez (2009) also presented evidence of the contribution of this variable on the
economic growth.

Then the Sargan test was conducted to identify super identifying restrictions. The result,
presented in the same table, shows that the model tested does not reject the hypothesis that the
restrictions are valid. Thus, it was concluded that the instruments used are valid, that is, not
correlated with the error term and are, therefore, correctly excluded from the equation estimated,
allowing the existence of the model.

And ﬁnally, the Test of Arellano-Bond seeks to show the autocorrelation for p differences

in the error term. The results found show that, for the ﬁrst difference in the error term, the
probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation is approximately zero. That
is, the model does not have evidence of speciﬁcation error.

5 Final Considerations

Fiscal decentralization is a relevant issue and much debated in the economic literature.
For the Brazilian case, this topic became more relevant after the 1988 Constitution, where the
states and municipalities gained more freedom related to the provision of public goods and
services. Thus, the present work proposed to identify the relationship, if any, between ﬁscal
decentralization and economic growth for the Brazilian states.

Through four measures of decentralization proposed by Akai e Sakata (2002), the esti-
mation performed found positive and signiﬁcant effect for the variable of decentralization A2,
which measures the decentralization as the ratio between the revenue of the states and the total
of their revenues. The positive result is in agreement with the expected theoretical support.

This result shows that ﬁscal decentralization is an important instrument to achieve higher
growth rates. In addition, the positive relationship between the rate of growth and the human
capital and the degree of trade openness show the types of policies that can be taken to achieve
better results in the long term.

These results are important, as they can contribute to the debate on public policies to
higher rates of economic growth. For this, policymakers should improve the mechanisms for
decentralization, so that to ﬁnd ways to strengthen the tax structure and to solve the problems of
expenditure and revenue redistribution of the government.

Thus, future efforts that aim to contribute to a greater decentralization of the federative
entities of the country can also contribute to its economic growth. It is important to note, however,
that such evidence should be treated with caution, since the reasons that have resulted in such
positive effect of decentralization on growth are not known.

Therefore, a direction that the present study can make, and be enlarged is to seek reasons
and evidence of the causes of ﬁscal decentralization that affect positively the GDP of the Brazilian
states. Thus, it is possible to conﬁrm with more accuracy, more efﬁcient public policies.

Finally, some questions deserve to be investigated to improve the understanding of the
relationship between the growth rate and ﬁscal decentralization in the Brazilian states. First, the
incorporation of new, more accurate, indicators in relation to growth rate. Second, there can be
made simulations of the impacts of the rate of growth through the expansion of the transfers or
the tax base itself. Thirdly, it is possible to analyze the case of ﬁscal decentralization to Brazil at
the municipal level.
