Abstract 

Since the 1980s, researchers have been puzzled by close to zero estimates of the elasticity of 
intertemporal substitution. Two possible causes are rates of return that are not representative of 
the agent‚Äôs portfolio return and inconsistent estimates due to the weak instrument problem. We 
examine if the aggregate capital return series for the United States and several instrument sets 
can provide large estimates of this elasticity. Our findings indicate that this return series leads 
to large estimates of the elasticity using different instrument sets. An unusual set of instruments 
performed well and its use in consumption-model estimates seems promising.

I. Introduction  

 

The  magnitude  of  the  elasticity  of  intertemporal  substitution  (EIS)  is  a  crucial  question  in 
Macroeconomics  and  Finance,  since  it  is  a  key  driving  force  of  consumption  (and  savings) 
allocation  across  periods.  Moreover,  given  its  central  role  in  several  economic  models, 
consistent  estimates  of  the  EIS  are  extremely  useful  to  researchers  in  their  calibration 
exercises‚Äîfor  instance,  Rankin  (2013)‚Äîand  to  policymakers  interested  in  the  aggregate 
economy. 

Since Hall (1988) and Campbell and Mankiw (1989) seminal studies, EIS estimates for 
the U.S. aggregate data have been found to be small, usually below 0.3 and barely statistically 
significant. Indeed, Hall (1988) concluded that the EIS is unlikely to be above 0.1 and, more 
recently, Campbell (2003) could not reject a null EIS. Others studies based on U.S. quarterly 
or annual aggregate data find statistically significant EIS estimates, but these estimates are still 
below 0.3 (Patterson and Pesaran, 1992; Hahm, 1998; and Yogo, 2004). These surprisingly low 
EIS  estimates  led  researchers  to  carefully  examine  this  important  issue  using  different 
approaches. 

The extant literature employs aggregate consumption and considers stock market and 
government bond returns as the typical asset return faced by consumers. As pointed out by Dacy 
and Hasanov (2011), stocks and government bonds are not the only assets held by the average 
household in economy. Consequently, a close to zero estimated EIS would not be a surprising 
result.  

In response to this remark,  one strand of the literature focused on specific  groups of 
consumers  in  order  to  use  the  asset  returns  that  mattered  to  them.  For  instance,  Vissing-
J√∏rgensen‚Äôs (2002) results suggest that consumption growth is correlated with expected stock 
returns in the population of households owning stocks, and her estimated EIS ranges between 
zero and 0.8.  

Although studies using household-level data confirm the importance of using the asset 
returns considered by specific groups of households, there is still the need to estimate the EIS 
for the representative household in the economy. In response to such needs, another strand of 
the literature focused on building the representative agent‚Äôs portfolio rate of return. Mulligan 
(2002) by means of a state-dependent utility model argued that the expected return on aggregate 
capital  drives  the  aggregate  consumption  growth.  In  this  vein,  the  expected  return  of  an 
aggregate  portfolio  gives  much  more  information  about  consumption  growth  rate  than  any 
particular  asset  return.  Hence,  Mulligan  (2002)  used  U.S.  national  accounts  data  and  built  a 
return  series  for  the  aggregate  capital  stock  and  a  new  set  of  instruments.  In  contrast  to  the 
previous literature, his estimates of the EIS using the aggregate return series are larger than one 
and statistically significant.1 

Given that  Mulligan‚Äôs (2002)  findings can potentially  represent  a solution to  the low 
EIS puzzle, in this paper we further scrutinize his results along two lines. First, we investigate 
if his estimates are plagued by the weak instrument problem, which could make his estimates 
to be inconsistent. Additionally, we also employ  weak instrument partially robust estimators 
and compute weak instrument robust confidence intervals for the EIS. The importance of the 
weak instrument problem is underscored in Yogo (2004). He finds that most estimates of the 
EIS obtained for the United States and other ten developed countries using either quarterly or 
annual data are plagued by weak instruments.  In particular, for the specifications using U.S. 

                                                           
1 Similarly, Dacy and Hasanov (2011) built a synthetic mutual fund (SMF) that is a share-weighted average of the 
quarterly returns of the assets held by the representative household, which is less comprehensive than Mulligan‚Äôs 
(2002)  measure.  Their  EIS  estimates  using  the  SMF  were  statistically  significant  and  close  to  0.2.  Moreover, 
Gomes and Paz (2013) concluded that estimates using SMF returns are plagued by weak instruments and, in some 
cases, partially robust estimators provided a statistically significant EIS estimate close to 0.2 

2 

 

data, only those employing T-Bill returns are not plagued by weak instruments; however, their 
EIS estimates are very close to zero.  

Second, given that Mulligan (2002) employs a set of excluded instruments that differs 
from the usual practice in the literature, we also estimate his specifications using Yogo‚Äôs (2004) 
and Dacy and Hasanov‚Äôs (2011) instrument sets. We do so to distinguish between two possible 
reasons  for  Mulligan‚Äôs  (2002)  results.  The  first  is  that  the  EIS  estimates  are  specific  to  the 
simultaneous use of his aggregate return series and his instrument set. The second reason is that 
his large EIS estimates are solely due to the use of his aggregate return series, therefore other 
instrument sets would lead to similar estimates.  

Our  results  indicate  that  Mulligan‚Äôs  (2002)  aggregate  capital  return  series  is  able  to 
deliver  relatively  large  and  statistically  significant  estimates  of  the  EIS  for  nondurable  and 
nondurable plus service consumption series. We find that his original instrument set does not 
suffer from  the weak instrument  problem.  Interestingly, similar  estimates  are obtained when 
Yogo‚Äôs  (2004)  instrument  lists  are  used,  even  though  such  instruments  sets  are  relatively 
weaker. This can be clearly seen in the wider weak instrument robust confidence intervals for 
the EIS using Yogo‚Äôs (2004) instrument  list,  which contain values  close to zero, and indeed 
below  0.3,  whereas  the  lower  bound  of  the  robust  confidence  interval  based  on  Mulligan‚Äôs 
instrument list is 0.67. These findings suggest that Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) aggregate capital return 
series  is  the  key  factor  driving  the  large  EIS  estimates.  Also,  the  good  performance  of 
Mulligan‚Äôs  (2002)  new  instrument  list suggests  its  use  in  estimation  of  consumption  models 
such as Menegatti (2010). 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 the consumption model 
used  to  motivate  the  empirical  specification  is  laid  out. Section  3  discusses  the  econometric 
methodology.  Section  4  describes  the  data  used  in  the  estimates.  Results  are  presented  in 
Section 5. Finally, Section 6 reports our conclusions. 
 
 
II. Consumption Model 
 
Consider a frictionless economy inhabited by a single representative agent with the Epstein and 
Zin (1989) non-expected utility. Following Gomes and Paz (2013), the agent‚Äôs intertemporal 
optimization problem leads to the following empirical specification.2 
 
‚àÜùëôùëõ(ùëêùë°) = ùõºùëñ +
 
where ùëêùë° is the per capita consumption growth in year t, bt is the return on the portfolio of all 
invested wealth, ùëüùëñ,ùë° is the return of the i-th asset held by the consumer, and ùúÄùëñ,ùë° is an innovation. 
The parameter ùúì is the EIS, and Œ∏ ‚â° (1 ‚àí ùõæ) (1 ‚àí ùúì‚àí1)
, where ùõæ is the coefficient of relative 
risk aversion. Notice that, by construction, the portfolio of invested wealth is not and cannot be 
proxied by the returns of any specific asset, like stock market returns.  

ùëüùëñ,ùë° + ùúÄùëñ,ùë°,   ùëñ = 1, ‚Ä¶ , ùëÅ 

ùëèùë° +

Several studies, for example Dacy and Hasanov (2011), adopted the constant relative 
risk aversion (CRRA) utility function. In the above framework, these preferences are equivalent 
to restricting the coefficient of relative risk aversion to be equal to the reciprocal of the EIS, 
which means imposing ùúÉ = 1. Therefore, Equation 1 becomes:  

 
 
 

 

‚àÜùëôùëõ(ùê∂ùë°) = ùõºùëñ + ùúìùëüùëñ,ùë° + ùúÄùëñ,ùë°,   ùëñ = 1, ‚Ä¶ , ùëÅ

Equation 2 has two interesting properties. The first is that the EIS can be estimated using 
the return of any asset held by the consumer, as long as valid instruments are available. In this 
vein, Vissing-J√∏rgensen (2002) and Gross and Souleles (2002) use microdata to look at specific 
groups  of  consumer  according  to  their  asset  holdings.  They  find  EIS  estimates  of  about  0.8 
when they use stock returns for stockholders or credit card interest rate for credit card debtors. 
Nevertheless, it is unclear that microdata-based EIS estimates are a measure of the EIS faced 
by  the  representative  consumer  in  the  aggregate  economy.  Therefore,  such  estimates  do  not 
seem appropriate to be used in calibration of representative agent models, for instance. For this 
reason, we employ the aggregate return measure built by Mulligan (2002) to estimate the EIS 
using aggregate consumption data. 

The  second  property  from  Equation  2  is  the  assumption  that  the  EIS  is  equal  to  the 
reciprocal of the coefficient of relative risk aversion, which implies that we can estimate the 
coefficient of relative risk aversion using the reverse of Equation 2. This idea was carried out 
by Hansen and Singleton (1983) and Campbell (2003), who find puzzling low estimates of the 
coefficient  of  relative  risk  aversion,  which  at  the  end  of  the  day  do  not  support  the  ùúÉ = 1 
assumption. 

Yet, even for ùúÉ ‚â† 1, Equation 2 can still be a special case of Equation 1 if the individual 
asset return is replaced by the return on the portfolio of all invested wealth, which is the return 
on the aggregate capital stock (Mulligan, 2002). Then, the sum of the second and third terms in 
the right-hand side of Equation 1 becomes ùúìùëèùë°, as seen in Equation 3: 

 

‚àÜùëôùëõ(ùëêùë°) = ùõºùëñ + ùúìùëèùë° + ùúÄùëñ,ùë°,   ùëñ = 1, ‚Ä¶ , ùëÅ

Consequently, Equation 3 implies that consistent estimates of the EIS can be obtained 
as long as return on total wealth is measured and valid instruments are available. And this is the 
approach pursued in this paper. 
 
 
III. Econometric Methodology 

 

In this paper, the EIS will be estimated by means of Equation 3 and an instrumental variable 
estimator. Such estimator requires excluded instruments to be orthogonal to error term and to 
be  correlated  with  the  endogenous  regressor,  i.e.  the  aggregate  capital  rate  of  return.  More 
precisely, this correlation cannot be small; otherwise the EIS estimate will be unreliable due to 
the weak instrument problem.  

Following  Yogo  (2004)  and  Gomes  and  Paz  (2013),  we  first  conduct  several 
econometric pre-tests to assess the weak instrument problem. Next, we employ weak instrument 
partially robust estimators. And finally, we compute weak instrument robust confidence interval 
for the EIS. 

The  first  econometric  pre-test  conducted  is  the  Kleibergen  and  Paap  (2006)  under-
identification test (KP). Its null hypothesis is that the excluded instrument has a zero correlation 
with the endogenous regressor. The next four tests come from Stock and Yogo (2002) and are 
based on the first-stage F-statistic of the two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimator. They have 
two types of null hypothesis. One is if the size of the bias with respect to OLS estimates is larger 
than 10% for the TSLS and the Fuller-k estimators. The other type is if the actual size of the 
5%  level  t-test  is  greater  than  10%  for  the  TSLS  and  the  limited  information  maximum 
likelihood  (LIML)  estimators.  The  use  of  pre-testing  may  lead  to  size  distortion  in  the 
subsequent  estimations  that  cannot  be  controlled.  For  this  reason,  we  now  turn  to  weak 
instrument partially robust estimators.

The TSLS, the Fuller-k and the LIML estimators have different limiting distributions 
under weak instruments. Therefore, different EIS estimates across these estimators also indicate 
the existence of the weak instrument problem. As discussed in Yogo (2004), both the Fuller-k 
and  the  LIML  are  partially  robust  to  the  weak  instrument  problem.  Accordingly,  if  there  is 
evidence of weak instruments, we will focus on Fuller-k and LIML estimates. 

Weak  instrument  robust  confidence  intervals  for  the  estimated  EIS  are  calculated  by 
inverting  econometric  tests  that  test  ùêª0: ùõΩ = ùõΩ0.  Since  these  tests  are  based  on  the  true 
parameter  value,  they  are  not  impaired  by  weak  instruments.  Yogo  (2004)  employed  the 
following  three  weak  instrument  robust  tests.  The  Anderson-Rubin  (1949)  ‚ÄòAR‚Äô  test,  the 
Lagrange multiplier ‚ÄòLM‚Äô test (Kleibergen, 2002), and the conditional likelihood ratio ‚ÄòCLR‚Äô 
test (Moreira, 2003). We employ the CLR test because Andrews, Moreira, and Stock (2006) 
showed that the CLR test  combines the  LM statistic and the  J-overidentification restrictions 
statistic in the most efficient way, thus it is more powerful than the AR and LM tests.3  

Even if we find that the EIS estimates using Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) aggregate return series 
are not plagued by weak instruments, we will re-estimate Equation 3 using instrument lists that 
are commonly used in the literature, such as Yogo‚Äôs (2004) and Dacy and Hasanov‚Äôs (2011). 
Given  that  Mulligan‚Äôs  (2002)  instrument  set  is  very  different  from  the  commonly  used 
instruments, by conducting these new estimations we can find out if Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) results 
are  driven  by  his  specific  combination  of  aggregate  returns  and  instrument  set  or  by  his 
aggregate return series alone. The former possibility implies close to zero EIS estimates when 
using  different  instrument  sets,  while  the  latter  implies  large  EIS  estimates  using  different 
instrument sets. 

 
 

IV. Data Description 
 
The  data  used  in  this  paper  consists  of  Mulligan‚Äôs  (2002)  and  Dacy  and  Hasanov‚Äôs  (2011) 
datasets. Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) data are used in the main estimations and comprise a synthetic real 
aggregate asset return and a real nondurable consumption per capita (ND) and a real nondurable 
plus service consumption per capita (NDS) series.  

To  construct  the  annual  aggregate  capital  return  series,  Mulligan  (2002)  used  U.  S. 
national  accounts  data.  His  measure  of  capital  stock  comes  from  BEA‚Äôs  (2000)  fixed  assets 
valued  at  current  cost  at  the  beginning  of  the  year.  Next,  the  direct  and  indirect  taxes  were 
deducted from the capital income net of depreciation per dollar of capital to obtain the after-tax 
annual aggregate capital rate of return.  

Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) instrument set (hereafter called Mulligan-1st lag) consists of the first 
lag of the after-tax capital return, nominal promised yield on commercial paper, inflation rate, 
yield  gap  between  BAA  and  AAA  bonds,  and  tax  rate.  Interestingly,  Hall‚Äôs  (1988) 
recommendation for using lags of variables no closer than the second lag because of aggregation 
problems does not apply here because Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) instrument sets do not contain lagged 
dependent variables (consumption growth). We construct another instrument set made of the 
second lag of the aforementioned variables, hereafter called Mulligan-2nd lag. 

The Dacy and Hasanov (2011) dataset is used to build four additional instrument sets. 
The third and fourth sets are based upon Yogo‚Äôs (2004) instruments. The third set (Yogo-1st 
lag) is composed of the first lag of the nominal T-Bill rate, inflation, consumption growth (ND 
or  NDS  depending  on  the  dependent  variable),  and  log  dividend-price  ratio.  The  fourth 
instrument set (Yogo-2nd lag) consists of the second lag of variables included in Yogo-1st lag 
set. The last two instrument sets are similar to Dacy and Hasanov‚Äôs (2011) instruments. The 
                                                           
3 This J-statistic is calculated at the true parameter value. So, it is different from Hansen‚Äôs J-statistic that is 
evaluated at the estimated parameter value, and therefore subject to the weak instrument problem. 

5 

 

fifth instrument set (DH-1st Lag) consists of one-, two-, and three-period lagged real T-Bill rate 
and consumption growth rate; one-period lagged bond default yield premium and bond horizon 
yield  premium.  And the sixth instrument  set (DH-2nd Lag) is  comprised of  two-, three-, and 
four-period  lagged  real  T-Bill  rate  and  consumption  growth  rate;  two-period  lagged  bond 
default yield premium and bond horizon yield premium. For the sake of comparability across 
estimates, we restrict the sample to cover 1952‚Äì1997 that is the period in which all instrument 
series are available.4  

Table  1  displays  the  descriptive  statistics  of  the  consumption  growth  rates  and  the 
aggregate  asset  returns.  Notice  that  the  average  growth  rate  of  the  NDS  is  greater  than  the 
average growth rate of ND, whereas the former is less volatile than the latter. In Figure 1 we 
can see the nondurable and the nondurable plus service consumption growth series over time. 
They have a similar behavior; however, the nondurable series is more volatile. Among the real 
return  rates  considered,  the  aggregate  capital  return  is  always  positive  and  has  the  lowest 
volatility. These last two remarks can be clearly seen in Figure 2, which exhibits the behavior 
of the Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) aggregate capital real return, the stock market real return, and the T-
Bill real return.  

 
 

V. Results 
 
In this section, we first conduct the weak instrument tests for the six instrument sets. Next, we 
report and discuss the EIS estimates obtained using the TSLS, Fuller-k, and LIML estimators; 
and the weak instrument robust confidence intervals. 

 

Weak instrument tests  
 
Table  2  displays  the  weak  instrument  tests  when  the  nondurable  consumption  growth  is  the 
dependent variable. The null hypothesis of under-identification of the KP test is rejected at the 
5% level of confidence for all instrument sets, except for DH-2nd lag. The Mulligan-1st lag is 
the only instrument set to exhibit a first-stage F-statistic above 10. For this instrument set, the 
null hypotheses that the coefficient of the TSLS or the Fuller-k estimators is severely biased are 
rejected.  The  p-value  for  the  LIML  size  test  is  below  the  1%  level,  implying  that  the  t-test 
coefficients for the LIML estimates are reliable. Nonetheless, the p-value for the TSLS size test 
is above 10%, indicating that the size of t-test for the TSLS estimated coefficient is not reliable. 
Along these lines, the results suggest taking the TSLS results with a grain of salt, and focusing 
on the Fuller-k and LIML estimates. The other instrument sets show a low first-stage F-statistic 
which do not lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis of the weak instrument tests. Thus, TSLS 
estimates using these instrument sets are definitely not reliable.  

Notice  that  Mulligan‚Äôs  instruments  sets  are  the  same  no  matter  which  consumption 
growth measure is used. But, Yogo‚Äôs (2004) and Dacy and Hasanov‚Äôs (2011) instrument sets 
include lagged consumption growth as an instrument. Consequently the weak instrument test 
results  change  according  to  the  consumption  growth  series  used.  We  conducted  weak 
instrument tests for nondurable plus service consumption growth, and found p-values similar 
to the ones for the nondurable consumption reported in Table 2. For the sake of brevity these 
results are not reported here, but are available upon request. 
 
EIS estimates and robust confidence intervals 

                                                           
4 Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) estimates refer to the 1947‚Äì1997 period. For Mulligan‚Äôs instrument sets we also conducted 
estimates using data covering this period and the results were similar to those reported here in the paper. Such 
results are available upon request.

The EIS estimates obtained by means of Equation 3 using Mulligan‚Äôs aggregate rate of return 
and nondurable consumption growth are reported in Table 3. Focusing on Mulligan‚Äôs-1st lag 
instrument set, the TSLS, Fuller-k, and LIML estimates of the EIS are between 1.34 and 1.37 
and are statistically significant at the 5% level. Such results are well above the earlier findings 
in the literature, and are very similar to the results obtained by Mulligan (2002) in his Table 3. 
The fact that our TSLS, Fuller-k, and LIML estimates are close to each other is another result 
supporting our claim that weak instrument problem is not a concern for this instrument set.  

The use of the Mulligan‚Äôs-2nd lag instrument set leads to larger EIS estimates ranging 
from 1.26 to 1.27. Yogo‚Äôs (2004) instruments also provide EIS estimates above one that are 
statistically  significant  at  the  5%  level.  The  estimates  using  Dacy  and  Hasanov‚Äôs  (2011) 
instrument  sets  have  a  worse  performance.  The  EIS  estimates  jump  wildly  across  different 
estimators clearly indicating very weak instruments. Therefore, estimation procedures partially 
robust to weak instruments lead to larger EIS estimates, even when Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) original 
instrument set is not used. In this vein, Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) aggregate capital return series seems 
to be the reason behind the large EIS estimates. 

The weak instrument robust confidence intervals are obtained by inverting the CLR test. 
The calculated intervals indicate a positive EIS for Mulligan‚Äôs-1st and 2nd lag and Yogo‚Äôs-1st 
lag  instruments.  Notice  that  the  confidence  intervals  for  Yogo‚Äôs-2nd  lag  and  DH-1st  lag 
instrument sets include negative values, while DH-2nd lag instruments provide an uninformative 
confidence interval. These facts do not necessarily weaken our previous conclusion. Intuitively 
speaking, the weaker the instrument set the wider will be the robust confidence interval. Thus, 
the interval for the Mulligan-1st lag is the narrowest, as suggested by our weak instrument test 
results. Therefore, the results for the other instrument sets can be understood as not being very 
informative due to relatively weaker instruments. 

So  far  our  results  using  aggregate  data  provide,  at  least  for  Mulligan‚Äôs  original 
instrument set, a larger than one  estimated EIS,  which is  well above the  estimates found by 
studies  using  aggregate  or  microdata.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  our  estimates  based  on 
Mulligan-1st instrument set are not plagued by weak instruments, but even methods robust to 
weak  instruments  corroborate  the  findings.  We  now  turn  to  the  EIS  estimates  employing 
nondurable plus service consumption.  

Table 4 reports the estimates of Equation  3 for nondurable plus  service consumption 
growth. The estimated EIS is not very different from Table 3 results. The estimates using DH-
1st lag and DH-2nd lag instrument sets varied substantially. This indicates the presence of weak 
instruments. The remaining instrument sets provided positive and statistically significant EIS 
estimates,  which  are  above  0.87.  Focusing  on  the  Mulligan-1st  lag  instrument  set,  estimates 
range  from  1.11  (TSLS)  to  1.24  (LIML).  As  before,  large  EIS  estimates  are  not  restrict  to 
Mulligan‚Äôs original instrument set. The weak instrument robust confidence interval, reported in 
Table 4, indicate that Mulligan-1st lag set leads to the narrowest interval, ranging from 0.79 to 
1.74. The confidence intervals for the Mulligan-2nd lag, Yogo-1st lag, Yogo-2nd lag, and DH-1st 
lag  instrument  sets  contain  only  positive  numbers,  and  their  lower  bound  is  below  0.5, 
indicating that EIS could be small and close to zero. And, the confidence interval implied by 
DH-2nd lag instruments is uninformative. 

These results using nondurable plus services consumption also provide large EIS point 
estimates,  and  these  estimates  were  not  limited  to  Mulligan‚Äôs  (2002)  instrument  sets  either. 
Thus, a similar conclusion applies here.  It is the Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) aggregate return rate and 
not his instruments sets that are leading to large EIS. And again, the same pattern emerges in 
the weak instrument robust intervals for the EIS. The weaker is the instrument set, the wider 
will the confidence interval for the EIS.

VI. Conclusions 

 

In the literature, the estimated elasticity of intertemporal substitution is usually  close to zero 
when aggregate data is used. Such puzzling result led researchers to investigate this issue from 
different perspectives. Following Gomes and Paz (2013), in this paper we combine two of these 
perspectives.  First,  we  use  an  aggregate  return  series  that  mimics  the  return  on  the  wealth 
portfolio of the representative household. Second, we employ several econometric techniques 
to verify and address the presence of the weak instrument problem in the EIS. 

The empirical evidence amassed in this paper indicate that Mulligan‚Äôs (2002) aggregate 
rate of return provide statistically significant estimates of the EIS that are not plagued by the 
weak instrument problem and are above one. By estimating the EIS using different instrument 
sets,  we  found  large  EIS  point  estimates  which  suggests  that  these  large  EIS  estimates  are 
mostly  due  to  Mulligan‚Äôs  (2002)  aggregate  return  series.  The  instrument  set  proposed  by 
Mulligan  (2002)  performed  well  and  may  be  useful  for  researcher  interested  in  estimating 
consumption models. As expected, the weak instrument fully robust confidence intervals for 
the EIS became wider when relatively weaker instruments were used. This does not necessarily 
weaken our conclusions, but it certainly stresses the pitfalls of overlooking the weak instrument 
problem when estimating the EIS.  

In light of our  findings,  an interesting avenue  for future research is  estimate the EIS 
using Mulligan‚Äôs aggregate return rate for specific consumer groups (for instance, bondholders, 
stockholders, etc‚Ä¶) and contrast these estimates with those obtained by  Vissing-J√∏rgensen‚Äôs 
(2002). Such exercise could shed some light if consumers take into account a benchmark return 
rate (like Mulligan‚Äôs) or their portfolio‚Äôs return rate.
