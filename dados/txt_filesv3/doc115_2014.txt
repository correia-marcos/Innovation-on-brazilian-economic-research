Introduction

Central bank’s behavior has been studied both empirical and theoretically in last four decades. In
particular, its preferences over inﬂation and output have been object of several researchers. The
main reason of that interest is the potencial inﬂation bias of the discretionary monetary policy. The
standard approach of those studies assumes that central bank’s preferences may be represented by
a strictly convex loss function, such that its minimization problem has unique interior solution1.
Seminal papers of Robert Barro and David Gordon (Barro and Gordon, 1983a,b) have formed the
base of this literature by adopting a loss function quadratic in inﬂation and linear in output.

However, it is not clear that central bank preferences can be represented by a loss function. If,
for the sake of simplicity, we assume that such preferences just express the underlying “tastes” of a
central banker, we may wonder whether there is an utility (actually, disutility) function representing
them. Adopting the axiomatic approach of decision theory, the answer of above question would be
based on verifying, for example, completeness, transitivity, and continuity of those preferences. In
this regard, the central banker would or would not satisfy such axioms depending on his particular
preference over inﬂation and output. Henceforward we consider the central bank’s loss function and
the central banker’s utility as synonymous.

If instead we assume that preferences of the central bank express those of the society or of a
representative individual, the answer to the above question has been given by Woodford (2002).
By assuming nominal price rigidities, that paper derives a loss function grounded in the welfare
of private agents. Speciﬁcally, it is shown that loss function is a quadratic (second-order Taylor
series) aproximation to the level of expected utility of the representative household in the rational
equilibrium. In this case, if the household’s preferences can be represented by an utility function,
those of the central bank can too. The functional form obtained in the Woodford’s aproximation is
almost the same of Barro and Gordon (1983a), namely quadratic both in the inﬂation and in the
output gap.

It is possible to observe diﬀerent types of central bankers’ preferences through the behavior of
their monetary policies. For instance, a central banker may be more conservative by focusing his
policy on ﬁghting inﬂation, or more populist by trying to increase output over price stability. Yet
the most usual behavior found both in practice and literature is one which concerning about those
two key variables. Formally, such preferences usually are represented by a loss function like

L(π, y) =

(π − π∗)2 +

1
2

(y − y∗)2,

λ
2

(1)

where π, π∗, y, y∗ and λ are inﬂation, its target (which may be implicit), output, its target (potential
output) and the relative weight given to output control, respectively. In this formulation, a higher
(lower) λ indicates a more populist (conservative) central banker2.

In fact, almost all models about central bank’s decision assume preferences like those expressed
by (1). The vast literature related to asymmetric information problem in monetary policy is a good
example of the theoretical limitation in choosing monetary authority’s types (e. g. Barro, 1986;
Canzoneri, 1985; Cukierman and Liviatan, 1991; Nolan and Schaling, 1996; Walsh, 2000). In general,
these papers assume that the central bank may be either extremely conservative or an optimizer who
always act to maximize its expected loss function. This is exactly the case presented by Backus
and Driﬃll (1985), in on of the earliest reputational models of monetary policy. The ﬁrst type is a
single-minded inﬂation ﬁghter while the second one wants minimize a function of type (1). The same

1An excelent survey of models where central bank is an optimizer agent in the context of optimal monetary policy

may be found in chapter 8 of Walsh (2010).

2An important modiﬁcation in the basic structure (1) is provided by Nobay and Peel (2003). This study models
asymmetric preferences in which impacts of inﬂation deviations on the central bank’s welfare depends on whether
inﬂation is below or above its target.

may be found when we analyse studies which deals with the optimal degree of conservativeness of
the central bank, like the seminal paper of Rogoﬀ (1985). Even recent new keynesian DSGE models
adopt loss functions like (1) (e. g. Clarida et al., 1999).

It seems very restrictive working with models where the objective function is always of the type
(1). Consider literature related to games of asymmetric information between the central bank and
the public, for example. There types are diﬀerentiated only by the value of λ. However, one may
want to allow more extreme behaviors. In this context, we may want to model a game in which the
public do not know whether the central banker is either very conservative (his only aim is to stabilize
prices) or very populist (worries only about increase output). Note that even if λ is very high, (1)
still give some weight to inﬂation control, such that formulation like (1) does not cover the behavior
just cited.

Considering the above discussion, the aim of this paper is twofold. First, we provide several types
of central banker’s preferences according to their monetary policy choices. Although not exhaustive,
our list covers from extreme (conservative and populist) to moderate behaviors such that it is ﬂexible
in relation to the degree of conservativeness, as well as in relation to monetary regimes. Secondly,
we use the traditional axiomatic approach for utility representation in order to investigate which of
those preferences admit numerical representation. Thus, as an intermediate step in this process, we
need to study whether the central banker’s type satisfy transitivity, completeness, and continuity.
All our analysis assumes that the central banker’s preferences are not necessarily the same of the
society (or representative household), such that we want to answer a question diﬀerent that posed
by Woodford (2002).

Our results signiﬁcantly contribute to all literature which models the central bank as a decision
maker. In particular, models of monetary policy with microfoundations are suitable applications of
our ﬁndings. Despite of having some desirable properties, like convexity, we found that several of
central banker’s preferences - mainly extreme behaviors - do not admit utility representation. Then,
studies which follow the tradition of Barro and Gordon (1983a,b), and therefore use diﬀerential
calculus tools, are restricted to adopt preferences like those expressed by (1). In fact, we show in our
main result that so called stabilizer central bank is the only that admits numerical representation.
Nevertheless, even preferences without utility representation may be useful as alternatives for studies
which propose diﬀerent types of central bank. The reason is that there is a multi-utility representation
in those cases. For example, literature in monetary games with asymmetric information may consider
our typology as a set of possible central banker’s preferences.

This paper is divided in three sections besides this introduction. Section 2 introduces deﬁnitions of
preferences and some of their properties, based on axiomatic approach of decision theory. That section
also presents a typology of central bankers which covers from conservative to populist behavior.
Section 3 investigates which of the presented preferences deﬁned in the previous section admit utility
representation. Finally, section 4 concludes by discussing about alternatives of representation for
those preferences that do not admit it through utility. Appendix A presents proofs of our results
ommited in the text.

2 A typology of central bankers

2.1 Preliminaries

We assume that central bankers has preferences over only two variables, namely inﬂation, π, and
output, y. Let Π and Y be the subsets of R, then (π, y) ∈ Π × Y ⊆ R × R. Despite of being
the most usual case found in literature, the study of two dimension problem has the advantage of
allowing analogies to the standard two goods consumer problem. Nevertheless, our results may be
easily generalized to choice sets of any ﬁnite dimension. For example, they may apply to a central
banker with preferences over inﬂation, output and exchange rate.

3

Deﬁnitions below are necessary in remaining of the text. In the following we closely follow notation

adopted by Debreu (1954) and Ok (2010).
Deﬁnition 2.1 A binary relation (cid:37) on Π × Y is said to be:

(i) reﬂexive if (π, y) (cid:37) (π, y) for every (π, y) ∈ Π × Y ;
(ii) complete if (π1, y1) (cid:37) (π2, y2) or (π2, y2) (cid:37) (π1, y1) for every (π1, y1), (π2, y2) ∈ Π × Y ;
(iii) transitive if (π1, y1) (cid:37) (π2, y2) (cid:37) (π3, y3) implies (π1, y1) (cid:37) (π3, y3) for every (π1, y1), (π2, y2),

(π3, y3) ∈ Π × Y .
Deﬁnition 2.2 A preference relation (cid:37) on Π × Y is a preorder on Π × Y . In other words, (cid:37) is a
binary relation that is transitive and reﬂexive.

As usual, deﬁnition 2.2 accounts to all the information that corcerns how a central banker com-
pares any two alternatives according to his “tastes”. We have choosen deﬁne preferences as preorder
rather than partial order because we wish let choices free to be incomplete. Our aim is to allow
behavior like the following. Consider two diﬀerent scenarios: the ﬁrst one presents high inﬂation and
high output, while in the second there is low inﬂation and low output. Some type of central banker
may ﬁnd hard to decide which situation is better.

Another important deﬁnition is that of utility representation.

Deﬁnition 2.3 Let (cid:37) be a preference relation on Π × Y . We say that a function u : Π × Y → R
represents (cid:37) provided that

(π1, y1) (cid:37) (π2, y2) if and only if u(π1, y1) ≥ u(π2, y2)

for every (π1, y1), (π2, y2) ∈ Π × Y . If such a function exists, we say that (cid:37) admits a utility repre-
sentation, and refer to u as a utility function for (cid:37).

As we have mentioned above, we consider the central bank’s loss function and the central banker’s
utility as synonymous, such that function u in deﬁnition 2.3 is actually a disutility. Yet such fact
does not change our analysis because a disutility function is just a negative of utility one, such that
for the agent to maximize an utility function is equivalent to minimize a disutility one.

Finally, deﬁnitions of continuity and convexity will have a major role in our existence theorems.

Deﬁnition 2.4 Let Γ+((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y) = {(π, y)|(π, y) (cid:37) ((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y)} and Γ−((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y) = {(π, y)|((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y) (cid:37) (π, y)} be the

upper contour set and the lower contour set of central banker, respectively. A binary relation (cid:37) on
Π × Y is said to be continuous on Π × Y if for all (π, y) ∈ Π × Y , the upper contour set and lower
contour set of (π, y) are closed.
Deﬁnition 2.5 A binary relation (cid:37) on Π × Y is said to be convex if for any (π1, y1), (π2, y2),
(π3, y3) ∈ Π × Y , where (π1, y1) (cid:37) (π3, y3) and (π2, y2) (cid:37) (π3, y3) is the case of
t(π1, y1) + (1 − t)(π2, y2) (cid:37) (π3, y3) for any t ∈ [0, 1] .

2.2 Central bankers’ types

We list several types of central bankers below.

1. Conservative: this central banker only aims to minimize inﬂation, such that output is con-
sidered in his choice between two alternative scenarios only when inﬂation is the same in both
cases. Formally, (π1, y1) (cid:37)CON (π2, y2) if and only if π1 < π2 or π1 = π2 and y1 > y2. Thus,
this central banker has lexicographic preferences.

4

2. Populist: this central banker is the extreme opposite of conservative one. Now the only goal
is to increase output and inﬂation is only considered in situations with two equal outputs.
Again, preferences are lexicographic: (π1, y1) (cid:37)P OP (π2, y2) if and only if y1 > y2 or y1 = y2
and π1 < π2.

3. Conservative with inﬂation target: this central banker seeks to minimize the distance
between observed inﬂation and its target level, π∗, and only consider output when this distance
is the same in two alternative scenarios. Given a target level ﬁxed, preferences are formally
expressed by (π1, y1) (cid:37)CON∗ (π2, y2) if and only if |π1 − π∗| < |π2 − π∗| or |π1 − π∗| = |π2 − π∗|
and y1 > y2.

4. Stabilizer: when there are targets of inﬂation and output3, the stabilizer central banker wants
to approximate observed inﬂation and product to their targets. However the weight given to
inﬂation stabilization may not be the same that given to output. Let λ be a parameter that
measures the relative weight given to output and y∗ be the output target, we deﬁne preferences
of a stabilizer central banker as (π1, y1) (cid:37)ST A (π2, y2) if and only if |π1 − π∗| + λ|y1 − y∗| ≤
|π2 − π∗| + λ|y2 − y∗|.

5. Optimistic: this central banker wants to minimize inﬂation and maximize output at the same
time. A scenario is better than another only if it presents lower inﬂation and higher output.
Formally, (π1, y1) (cid:37)OP T (π2, y2) if and only if π1 ≤ π2 and y1 ≥ y2. Note these preferences are
equivalent to the product order.

6. Asymmetric: we say a central banker has asymmetric preferences if his choices change ac-
cording to state of the economy. This kind of behavior assumes that inﬂation is a problem
only when it is above its target. Therefore, it may be modeled by (π1, y1) (cid:37)ASY (π2, y2) if and
only if y1 > y2 or y1 = y2 and π1 < π2, if π1, π2 ≤ π∗; and (π1, y1) (cid:37)ASY (π2, y2) if and only if
π1 < π2 or π1 = π2 and y1 > y2, if π1, π2 > π∗.

List above does not cover all possible central banker’s behavior. However, types presented are
surely representative of the set of all preferences. First, list covers extreme behaviors, like conservative
and populist types, for example. Moreover, it presents ﬂexibility about the degree of conservative-
ness of the central bank. This is accounted by the stabilizer central banker, which is more or less
conservative according to the value assumed by λ. Note that if λ = 0, for example, the central banker
worries only about inﬂation4. Similarly, a more populist behavior may be obtained with higher λ.
Further, few changes are necessary to deﬁne a populist with inﬂation (or product) target preference
or even an alternative asymmetric type in which behavior changes according to output is above or
below its target. Second, typology is ﬂexible about monetary regimes, such that it covers preferences
in an inﬂation targeting setting, for instance.

Regarding the nomenclature adopted, we closely follow the large literature of optimal monetary
policy. For instance, the central banker which gives much more weight to inﬂation ﬁght relative to
output stabilization is called conservative by Rogoﬀ (1985) and Barro (1986) among others. The
name “populist” for the central banker mainly concerned with output growth, in its turn, is adopted
by Guzzo and Velasco (1999) (see also Berger et al., 2001; Jerger, 2002; Lippi, 2002). Despite of
dealing with another type of asymmetry, the names of our asymmetric central bankers are based on
Nobay and Peel (2003) and Ruge-Murcia (2003). Further, we choose call “optimistic” the central
banker who always wants more output and less inﬂation because of the great diﬃcult of achieving
such goal. To best of our knowledge, term “optimist” has never used in literature.

3Even if these targets are implicit our characterization is valid. For example, central bank may seek to achieve the

potential output, namely a non explicit target.

4Such behavior, with λ = 0, is still diﬀerent from that of conservative type. Observe that when both types face

(π1, y1) and (π1, y2) with y2 > y1, conservative central banker prefers (π1, y2) while stabilizer (λ = 0) is indiﬀerent.

5

Example below illustrates diﬀerences between central banker’s types and easily enable us to check

some of above axioms.

Example 2.6 Lets consider the following “bundles” of inﬂation and output: (1, 0), (0, 1),
(1, 1), (2, 2) ∈ Π × Y . Further, suppose that π∗ = 1 and y∗ = 1. Then we have:

1. (0, 1) (cid:37)CON (1, 1) (cid:37)CON (1, 0) (cid:37)CON (2, 2);
2. (2, 2) (cid:37)P OP (0, 1) (cid:37)P OP (1, 1) (cid:37)P OP (1, 0);
3. (1, 1) (cid:37)CON∗ (1, 0) (cid:37)CON∗ (2, 2) (cid:37)CON∗ (0, 1);
4. here we have to analyse two cases: λ ≥ 1 and λ < 1. If λ ≥ 1, so (1, 1) (cid:37)ST A (0, 1) (cid:37)ST A
(1, 0) (cid:37)ST A (2, 2). On the other hand, when λ < 1, (1, 1) (cid:37)ST A (1, 0) (cid:37)ST A (0, 1) (cid:37)ST A (2, 2);

5. given the avaiable alternatives, the only possible choice for the optimistic central banker is

(0, 1) (cid:37)OP T (1, 0);

6. the asymmetric central banker also is not able to choose between all alternatives, such that

(0, 1) (cid:37)ASY (1, 1) (cid:37)ASY (1, 0), but (2, 2) is not comparable with the other “bundles”.

Binary relations (cid:37)CON , (cid:37)P OP , (cid:37)CON∗ and (cid:37)ASY are clearly complete. On the other hand, a
central banker with (cid:37)OP T is not able to choose between ﬁve of six possible pairs of inﬂation and
output. For example, when the avaiable choices are only (0, 1) and (2, 2), an optimistic type would
choose neither of them because the ﬁrst one has lower inﬂation while the second has greater output. As
we have deﬁned (cid:37)ST A, it is also incomplete. The reason is that “bundles” above and below inﬂation
target are not comparable. Yet we may change its deﬁnition by adding a criterium of decision for
these situations - inﬂation below inﬂation target is preferred, for instance. Such change does not
modify our result, such that we follow the original deﬁnition.

Our ﬁrst task is to answer whether all central banker’s types listed above satisfy conditions of
deﬁnition 2.2, that is, whether they all are preorders on Π×Y . Proposition 2.7 answers that question.
Proposition 2.7 (cid:37)i is a preference on Π × Y for i = {CON, P OP, CON∗, ST A, OP T, ASY }.

One interesting fact is that all preferences deﬁned above have the desirable property of convexity.
It turns out all central bankers analised consider “averages better than the extremes”. As it is well
known, this roughly corresponds to the concept of diminishing marginal utility (without requiring
utility functions). Theorem 2.8 below states it formally.
Theorem 2.8 (cid:37)i is convex on Π × Y for i = {CON, P OP, CON∗, ST A, OP T, ASY }.

3 Existence of loss function

Which of central banker’s preferences deﬁned in the section 2.2 admits an utility representation?
There are several theorems on utility representation in literature (e.g. Eilenberg, 1941; Rader, 1963).
Because the central banker’s choice set is Π × Y ⊆ R × R, it suﬃces to consider those results which
deal with separable metric spaces. Within such context, we based our analysis on the well known
result due to Debreu (1954):
Theorem 3.1 (Debreu, 1954) Let X be a topological space with a countable basis, and (cid:37) a complete
If (cid:37) is continuous, then it can be represented by a continuous utility
preference relation on X.
function.

6

As we have mentioned above, the central banker’s set of alternatives X = Π × Y is separable,
which implies it has a countable basis. Therefore, it satisﬁes one of the requirements of theorem
3.1. We must then verify which type of central banker has complete and continuous preferences in
order to decide the applicability of Debreu’s result. In fact, our main contribution in this section is
a stronger result, given by theorem 3.2 below.

Theorem 3.2 The only central banker’s type whose preference admits utility representation is the
stabilizer ((cid:37)ST A).

Some comments are necessary about theorem 3.2. First, note that it implicitly makes two claims:
stabilizer central banker does admit utility representation but all the remaining types do not.
It
implies we must divide strategy of proof in two parts. Concerning the existence part (stabilizer), it
suﬃces to use theorem 3.1. However, Debreu’s result enumerates only necessary conditions for utility
existence. In fact, it does not exclude the possibility of discontinuous or incomplete preferences admit
utility representation. Thus we must show non-existence part (other types) through other procedure.
Second comment is related to ﬁrst one. Since all central banker’s type except stabilizer admit
utility representation, and considering necessary conditions given by theorem 3.1, we may ask which
of such requirements are not satisﬁed by those preferences. First, observe that the optimist central
banker has incomplete preferences5. In order to see that, consider π1 < π2, y1 < y2 and note he is not
able to choose between (π1, y1) and (π2, y2). In addition, it is well know that lexicographic preferences
are not continuous, such that conservative and populist types clearly do not satisfy those conditions.
Asymmetric preference does not satisfy them as well, because it is formed by two lexicographic
segments (below and above π∗). Proposition below summarizes the above discussion.
Proposition 3.3 (cid:37)i is not continuous on Π × Y for i = {CON, P OP, CON∗, OP T, ASY }.

4 Concluding Remarks

Although the only preference that admits utility representation be the stabilizer, it does not mean
that the other types of central banker are not able to make a decision. In order to see that, consider
one of those preferences of lexicographic type, say populist. Now suppose that a central bank chooses
the most preferred “bundle” from a set of the form

B(m) = {(π, y)|h(π, y; k) = m}

where k >> 0 is a parameter vector, m is a scalar and function h(·) is some policy constraint. If h(·)
is linear, h(π, y; k) = k1π + k2y, for instance, then a central banker with decision function

v (B(m)) = (0, max{y|h(π, y; k) = m for some π})

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

m
k2

=

0,

,

will always choose the same pair (π, y) that a populist central banker contrained by B(m). In this
sense, v(·) serves as an adequate behavior rule for preferences like populist one.

A more general result is provided by literature of representation of incomplete preferences (e. g.

Evren and Ok, 2011).
Deﬁnition 4.1 Let (cid:37) be a preference relation on Π × Y . We say that a nonempty set U of real
functions on Π × Y represents (cid:37) provided that

(π1, y1) (cid:37) (π2, y2) if and only if u(π1, y1) ≥ u(π2, y2) for each u ∈ U

5In fact, (cid:37)OP T is not continuous too, as proposition 3.3 states.

7

for every (π1, y1), (π2, y2) ∈ Π × Y . If such a set U exists, we say that (cid:37) admits a multi- utility
representation.

Proposition 4.2 There exists a multi-utility representation for every preference relation.

As a example of mult-utility representation, consider the optimistic central banker. Deﬁne u1 :
Π × Y → R by u1(π, y) := −π and u2 : Π × Y → R by u2(π, y) := y. Then note that {u1, u2}
represents (cid:37)OP T . In fact, as proposition 4.2 makes clear, there are multi-utility representations for
all preferences, such that it suﬃces to ﬁnd which U satisﬁes deﬁnition 4.1 in each case.

We conclude by recalling that always there is a loss by dealing with preferences without utility
representation. The main reason is the impossibility of using standard optimization techniques.
In this context, for models of central bank decision that follow traditional approach initiated in
Barro and Gordon (1983a,b), our central result is a bad news. Those studies actually are restricted
to assume stabilizer behavior for central banker and consequently adopt utility function like (1).
However, we have shown that there is some ﬂexibility if we are able to give up of diﬀerential calculus
tools. Furthermore, all our analysis makes sense if preferences of the central banker are not necessarily
the same of the representative household, because the case in that these preferences are equal has
been adressed by Woodford (2002).

A Ommited proofs
Proof. Proposition 2.7. Clearly, (cid:37)CON and (cid:37)P OP are lexicographic preferences, so they are
preorders. Moreover, (cid:37)OP T is a product order, such that it is a preorder as well. We must show that
remaining types are preorders too.

if ((cid:98)π1, y1) (cid:37)CON ((cid:98)π2, y2). Therefore (cid:37)∗

Consider initially (cid:37)∗
CON (π2, y2) if and only
Now lets analyze (cid:37)ST A. Reﬂexivity is trivial. Suppose that (π1, y1) (cid:37)ST A (π2, y2) and (π2, y2) (cid:37)ST A
(π3, y3). Then |π1 − π∗| + λ|y1 − y∗| ≤ |π2 − π∗| + λ|y2 − y∗| ≤ |π3 − π∗| + λ|y3 − y∗|, what implies
that (π1, y1) (cid:37)ST A (π3, y3).
Finally, in order to show that (cid:37)ASY is a preorder it suﬃces to note that if πi > π∗, then (cid:37)ASY is
a lexicographic order, and if πi ≤ π∗, (cid:37)ASY is a lexicographic order as well.
Proof. Proposition 2.8. We have already seen that (cid:37)i for i = CON, P OP, CON∗, ASY is a
lexicographic order, such that it suﬃces to show convexity for any i. Thus, lets consider conservative
type and suppose that (π1, y1) (cid:37)CON (π3, y3) and (π2, y2) (cid:37)CON (π3, y3). By deﬁnition of (cid:37)CON
we have π1 < π3 or π1 = π3 and y1 > y3, and π2 < π3 or π2 = π3 and y2 > y3. Now note that
tπ1 + (1 − t)π2 ≤ max{π1, π2} ≤ π3 for any t ∈ [0, 1]. Thus, two cases are possible. The ﬁrst one is

CON is a preorder because so (cid:37)CON is.

max{π1, π2} < π3, such that t(π1, y1) + (1 − t)(π2, y2) (cid:37) (π3, y3). The second is max{π1, π2} = π3,
which implies π1 = π2. But since ty1 + (1 − t)y2 ≥ min{y1, y2} ≥ y3, we also have t(π1, y1) + (1 −
t)(π2, y2) (cid:37)CON (π3, y3).
For (cid:37)OP T , assume again that (π1, y1) (cid:37)OP T (π3, y3) and (π2, y2) (cid:37)OP T (π3, y3). Then we have
π1 ≤ π3 and y1 ≥ y3, and π2 ≤ π3 and y2 ≥ y3. It follows that tπ1 + (1 − t)π2 ≤ max{π1, π2} ≤ π3
and ty1 + (1 − t)y2 ≥ min{y1, y2} ≥ y3 for any t ∈ [0, 1]. We conclude therefore that t(π1, y1) + (1 −
t)(π2, y2) (cid:37)OP T (π3, y3).
Finally, suppose (π1, y1) (cid:37)ST A (π3, y3) and (π2, y2) (cid:37)ST A (π3, y3). By deﬁnition of stabilizer

Now note that

|π1 − π∗| + λ|y1 − y∗| ≤ |π3 − π∗| + λ|y3 − y∗|

|π2 − π∗| + λ|y2 − y∗| ≤ |π3 − π∗| + λ|y3 − y∗| .

|(tπ1 + (1 − t)π2) − π∗| + λ|(ty1 + (1 − t)y2) − y∗| = |t(π1 − π∗) + (1 − t)(π2 − π∗)|
+λ|t(y1 − y∗) + (1 − t)(y2 − y∗)|
≤ t(|π1 − π∗| + λ|y1 − y∗|) + (1 − t)(|π2 − π∗| + λ||y2 − y∗|)
≤ max{|π1 − π∗| + λ|y1 − y∗| ,|π2 − π∗| + λ|y2 − y∗|}
≤ |π3 − π∗| + λ|y3 − y∗| ,

(4)
where we use expressions (2), (3) and the triangle inequality. Thus, by (4) we have t(π1, y1) + (1 −
t)(π2, y2) (cid:37)ST A (π3, y3).
Proposition A.1 (cid:37)ST A is continuous.

Proof. Proposition A.1. We must show Γ+((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y) = {(π, y)|(π, y) (cid:37)ST A ((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y)} is a closed set.
The same argument may be used to prove the closedness of Γ−((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y). For, consider any sequence
{(πn, yn)} ∈ Γ+((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y) with {(πn, yn)} → (π, y). Then, by the deﬁnition of stabilizer preference,

|πn − π∗| + λ|yn − y∗| ≥ |(cid:98)π − π∗| + λ|(cid:98)y − y∗|

(5)

for every n ∈ N.

Note that by applying triangle inequality in expression (5),

|πn − π| + |π − π∗| + λ (|yn − y| + |y − y∗|) ≥ |πn − π∗| + λ|yn − y∗|

≥ |(cid:98)π − π∗| + λ|(cid:98)y − y∗| .

(6)
Moreover, as {(πn, yn)} → (π, y), there exists M ∈ N such that |πn − π| < 1 and |yn − y| < 2 for
any n > M . Thus,

(1 + λ2) + (|π − π∗| + λ|y − y∗|) ≥ |(cid:98)π − π∗| + λ|(cid:98)y − y∗| .

Now, it suﬃces to let 1 → 0 and 2 → 0 to see that (π, y) ∈ Γ+((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y).

Proof. Theorem 3.2. For the existence part, note that (cid:37)ST A is complete, because for every
(π1, y1), (π2, y2) ∈ Π × Y we have

(7)

or

|π1 − π∗| + λ|y1 − y∗| ≥ |π2 − π∗| + λ|y2 − y∗|

|π1 − π∗| + λ|y1 − y∗| ≤ |π2 − π∗| + λ|y2 − y∗| .

In addition, by proposition A.1, (cid:37)ST A is continuous. Then, by theorem 3.1, (cid:37)ST A admits a continuous
utility representation.

Recall (cid:37)OP T is incomplete, so obviously it does not admit utility representation.

In order to
show non existence for the remaining preferences we use a traditional proof by contradiction (e. g.
Debreu, 1954; Ok, 2010). So suppose there exists u : Π × Y → R which represents (cid:37)i for i =
CON, P OP, CON∗, ASY , such that for every π1, (π1, 1) (cid:37)i (π1, 0) if and only if u(π1, 1) ≥ u(π1, 0).
Then, for each π1 we can assign a nondegenerate interval

R(π1) = [u(π1, 0), u(π1, 1)] .

Next, take π2 such that π2 < π1. Again, we have u(π2, 1) > u(π2, 0) and R(π2) = [u(π2, 0), u(π2, 1)]
is nondegenerate. Further, R(π1) ∩ R(π2) = ∅ because π2 < π1 implies u(π2, 0) > u(π1, 1). Observe
that we can deﬁne R(πj) for any πj ∈ Π ⊆ R, and such that all sets are disjoint from each other. More-
over, there are as many R(πj) as the number of real numbers. Let Φ(y) = {R(πj)|(πj, y) ∈ Π × Y }
the set of all those intervals. Thus, cardinality of Φ(y) is 2ℵ0.
Now, let Q(πj) = {q|q ∈ Q ∩ R(πj)} be the set of all rational numbers contained in R(πj) for
πj ∈ Π ⊆ R. Clearly, Q(π1) ∩ Q(π2) = ∅ for any π1, π2 ∈ Π with π1 (cid:54)= π2. Finally, if we deﬁne
Θ(y) = {Q(πj)|(πj, y) ∈ Π × Y } as the set of all Q(πj), it is possible to note that there is a injective
map from Φ(y) into Θ(y) because each R(πj) contains Q(πj). Therefore, we conclude that cardinality
of Θ(y) is 2ℵ0. But it is impossible given that Θ(y) ⊆ Q.
Proof. Proposition 3.3. It suﬃces to prove the result for one of the types, because the procedure
is similar for i = CON, P OP, CON∗, OP T, ASY . Lets show that conservative with inﬂation target
lexicographic order too. For, consider its upper contour set Γ+((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y) = {(π, y)|(π, y) (cid:37)CON∗ ((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y)}
preference is not continuous. In fact, as proof of proposition 2.7 makes clear, (cid:37)CON∗ is a kind of
and deﬁne a sequence (πn, yn) = ((cid:98)π − 1
n − π∗(cid:12)(cid:12) < |(cid:98)π − π∗|, we have (πn, yn) ⊆ Γ+((cid:98)π,(cid:98)y). However, observe that
Given |πn − π∗| = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:98)π − 1
n , (cid:98)y

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:98)y

(πn, yn) → ((cid:98)π, (cid:98)y
