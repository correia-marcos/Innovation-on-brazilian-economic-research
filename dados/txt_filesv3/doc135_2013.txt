Abstract 

 
Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Thailand,  known  as  SEANICs  (South  East  Asian  Newly  Industrialized 
Countries), were initially specialized in primary exports but within a short period of time they succeeded 
in achieving extensive export and productive diversification towards manufacturing. These countries had 
registered  rapid  growth  of  GDP  and  per  capita  GDP  between  1980  e  2010,  and  had  passed  through 
remarkable  structural  change  in  their  economies.  The  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  analyze  the 
development paths of SEANICs, investigating its main source of economic growth, especially related to 
the regional economic integration. Although the usual developmental literature emphasize the importance 
of manufacturing export diversification to generate high growth rates and to allow technological catch up, 
SEANICs’  cases  demonstrate  that  this  is  not  necessarily  true.  These  processes  were  experienced  in  a 
small  scale,  so  manufacture  development  did  not  guarantee  the  overcoming  of  structural  heterogeneity 
nor of technological catch-up. 
 
Resumo 
Indonésia,  Malásia  e  Tailândia,  conhecidas  como  SEANICs  (Países  Recentemente  Industrializados  do 
Sudeste  Asiático),  tiveram  economias  inicialmente  especializadas  em  exportações  primárias,  mas  que 
dentro de um curto período de tempo conseguiram alcançar extensa exportação e diversificação produtiva 
na indústria de transformação. Estes países registraram um rápido crescimento do PIB e do PIB per capita 
entre  1980  e  201,  e  passou  por  uma  mudança  estrutural  notável  em  suas  economias.  O  objetivo  deste 
trabalho  é analisar as trajetórias de  desenvolvimento  dos SEANICs, investigando sua principal  fonte de 
crescimento econômico, especialmente relacionada à integração econômica regional. Embora a literatura 
desenvolvimentista costume enfatizar a importância da diversificação das  exportações e da de produção 
para  gerar  altas  taxas  de  crescimento  e  recuperar  o  atraso  tecnológico,  o  estudo  de  caso  dos  SEANICs 
demonstrar que isso não é necessariamente verdade. Estes processos foram experimentados em pequena 
escala, de modo  desenvolvimento  que o desenvolvimento industrial não tenha  garantido a superação da 
heterogeneidade estrutural tampouco o catch-up tecnológico.

From  export  specialization  in  natural  resources  to  diversification  in  manufacturing:  the 
development strategies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand since 1980 
 
Introduction 

Since  the  end  of  Bretton  Woods  the  world’s  eyes  are  turned  to  the  Asian  region,  stage  of  the  major 
recent cases of fast and great economic growths witnessed in the globe. After the robust rise of Japan in 
the post-war period, the Asian “Tigers” or NICs (Newly Industrialized Countries: Korea, Taiwan, Honk 
Kong  and  Singapore)  and  later  the  Asian  “Dragons”  or  SEANICs  (South  East  Asian  NICs:  Indonesia, 
Malaysia and Thailand)3 experienced a tremendous structural change in their trade and productive profiles 
towards manufacturing. Many analysts studied their development paths, trying to identify the roots of the 
expansion. Assuredly the concomitant growth of so many countries in one single same region cannot be 
understood  without  a  regional  perspective.  The  most  known  one  is  the  “flying  geese”  framework  put 
originally by Akamatsu (1962), in which Japan is the leader goose that diversifies its production and trade 
towards higher value-added activities that are exported to third countries, and import from the followers 
geese  (Asian  economies)  primary  products  and  low  value-added  manufacturing.  However,  the  original 
flying  geese theory  fits  only to  the vertical  case  of linear development (YOKOKAWA, 2012), so some 
authors prefer the expression “bamboo capitalism” to name the horizontal modeling of regional economic 
integration  (XING,  2007).  Despite  their  important  contributions  both  approaches  are  limited  for 
considering  only  the  role  of  supply  factors  on  the  process  of  productive  diversification  of  production, 
therefore  as  its  discussed  in  the  next  section,  demand  dimension  must  be  included  in  this  analytical 
scheme for understanding SEANICs’ high growth rates.  

 SEANICS  have  been  being  a  space  of  dispute  that  deserves  special  attention  because  -,  differently 
than  NICs  and  Japan  -  Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Thailand  are  resource-abundant  and  energy  provider 
economies  that  had  diversified  towards  manufacturing,  apparently  neglecting  initial  comparative 
advantages. To some extent their economic growths also contradicts the literature that considers natural 
resources (NR)  a curse (SACHS  & WARNER, 1995).  Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand in  the eighties 
were  specialized  in  primary  exports  but  within  a  short  period  of  time  succeeded  in  achieving  extensive 
export  and  productive  diversification.  These  countries  had  experienced  rapid  growth  of  GDP  and  per 
capita  GDP  between  1980  e  2010,  respectively  with  annual  averages  of  5.4%  and  4.0%  in  Indonesia, 
6.0% and 2.7% in Malaysia, and 5.6% and 3.4% in Thailand (WDI, 2011). Manufacturing value added in 
SEANICs  has  annually  grown  8%  in  average  in  the  same  period.  It  is  clear  that  this  sector  has  pushed 
SEANICs’  expressive  rates  of  growth  and  a  remarkable  structural  change  towards  manufacturing. 
However, and contrary to what occurred to the NICs, the rise of South East Asian Tigers’ share in world 
manufacturing exports has not  been  accompanied by  an analogous rise in  its share of world  income.  In 
spite  of  their  per  capita  income  have  doubled  between  1980  and  2010,  those  nations  remain  out  of  the 
ranking of the top sixty countries in terms of personal income (in dollars, according to WDI (2011)).  

In the early eighties Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand were highly centralized military States,4 under 
heavy  influence  of  the  U.S.  and  Japan.  SEANICs  States  had  to  deal  with  complex  tasks  of  late 
industrialization,  particularly  related  to  foreign  capital  and  demand  dependence.  They  implemented 
development  plans5 that essentially  allowed the  attraction of foreign direct  investments  of multinational 
companies  and  the  empowerment  of  domestic  industrial  groups  in  some  economic  activities.  Japan  has 
been playing an important role on these development paths, not only due to its foreign direct investment 
or  as  an  importer  of  SEANICs’  exports,  but  also  politically  –  mainly  as  a  leader  of  their  regional 
integration  in  the  international  value  chains  and  financial  flows,  in  a  dynamic  where  the  US  have  been 
being  the  consumer  of  last  resource.  Since  the  beginning  of  the  last  decade,  China  is  becoming  a  big

pursued by another coup of General Suharto in 1967, who remained head of state until 1999. The current Malaysia State was 
formed in 1965 (after the separation of Singapore), ruled by  the Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad for 21 years between 
1981-2003. In Thailand, dictatorships began prior to WWII and lasted until 1988, and there was another State coup in 2006.

market, but still Japan is more important as an absorber of manufacturing exports of Indonesia, Malaysia 
and Thailand as a final or for processing exports .  

The objective of this paper is to critically analyze the development paths of SEANICs, showing its 
evolution and contradictions. The analysis particularly investigates the role of regional integration in the 
promotion of structural change both in exports and production of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, from 
a  macroeconomic  perspective.  Traditionally,  the  literature  on  Asian  development  discusses  whether  the 
reasons  for  the  economic  development  were  “pro-market”  (related  to  financial  and  trade  opening,  and 
“less  State”)  or  “nationalistic”  (related  to  industrial  policy  and  protectionism;  “more  State”).  Here  this 
dichotomy is avoided because their economic regimes were hybrid, i.e. both phenomena occurred in the 
three  countries  under  study  in  different  degrees  and  temporalities,6  but  accommodating  external  trends 
towards globalization.  

First section of the paper presents the dynamics of trade and productive integration of SEANICs, 
emphasizing the  contribution  of  macroeconomic regime  – especially the  exchange rate  – and of foreign 
direct  investment.  Second  section  examines  foreign  trade  and  it  describes  the  process  of  manufacturing 
diversification  related  to  the  engagement  in  global  values  chains  (GVC),  led  by  Japanese  industrial 
conglomerates. Final notes summarize main contributions of the paper. 
 
 

1)  The dynamics of productive integration and the macroeconomic regime  

 
Let us understand the dynamic of the demand related to the rapid GDP growth in SEANICs. Their high 
rates of economic growth between 1980 and 2010 are closely related to export growth (see Charts 1 to 3). 
Due to greater integration in the value chains of the electronics industry, both Malaysia and Thailand have 
their rates of GDP and investment  growth more  correlated to  the rate of  exports growth.  As Table A10 
shows, the investment to GDP ratio recorded higher levels in Thailand, reaching a maximum rate of 44% 
in average from 1990 to 1994. Despite the crisis, SEANICs registered the highest investment rates in the 
nineties, above 30%. But there was a significant reduction in the share of investment in GDP in the 2000s. 
Consumption has lost relative importance vis-à-vis other demand components during the eighties and the 
nineties in the three countries, but then it started to grow again in the 2000s in Indonesia and Malaysia – 
reaching 50%  and 58%  of GDP share in  the second half of the decade.  Thus, in  the  current  decade the 
decline of investment share was compensated replaced by consumption in these two countries. According 
to Jetin (2012) the main mechanism that triggered the increase in domestic consumption was the strong 
expansion  of  formal  employment,  in  spite  of  low  wages,  which  also  grew.  Similarly,  government 
spending lost share in GDP from 1980 to 1999 in SEANICs but increased slightly in the 2000s, mainly in 
Malaysia (13% of GDP). 

The most impressive structural changes took place in foreign trade, mainly in Malaysia and Thailand. 
In Malaysia, exports expanded uninterruptedly  from  a level  of 50% of GDP  between 1980  and 1984 to 
nearly 120% between 2005 and 2009. The rise in the export share in GDP in Thailand was also amazing: 
from  20%  to  70%  of  the  GDP  at  the  same  period.  By  its  turn,  Indonesian  exports  have  fallen  between 
1980 and 1984 because of the drop in oil exports, thus it stayed at a level of 40% of GDP until a new rise 
in the end of the period pulled by natural resources. Analogously imports grew at a fast rate, very close to 
that of exports in Indonesia and Malaysia, and even higher in the case of Thailand. Therefore net exports 
of these countries were small or negative between 1980 and 2009. This was due to the strong process of 
industrialization through import substitution and also  to the way of integration into global value chains, 
which was importing intermediate goods to re-export low value-added manufacturing goods. 

Impressive  rates  of  export  growth  were  followed  by  high  growth  rates  of  imports  too,  but  except  in 
Thailand before the 1997 crisis, in general these countries had surplus in trade in goods (Table 1). Until 
the financial crisis the surplus in net exports helped to alleviate, though not solved, the deficit in current 
account – which was generalized in this period in SEANICs. This means that the balance of services plus 
                                                 
6 Whilst SEANICs were consolidating their independence process and reorganizing their primary-exporting economies, Japan, 
Korea and NICs attracted large inflows of productive and financial investments of the great powers, leveraging their economy 
before the rest of the region.

Differently,  in  the  last  decade,  the  surplus  in  trade  balance  grew  tremendously,  enabling  also  positive 
current accounts. The huge Chinese demand of raw material and other traditional exports seemed to play 
an important contribution for this change.

The  importance  of  public  investment  in  SEANIC’s  gross  fixed  capital  formation  is  remarkable.  It 
corresponded to almost half of the total in Malaysia more recently, and 25% in Thailand (see Table A3 in 
the Annex). Another remarkable characteristic is the importance of foreign firms in private investment. In 
terms  of  external  contribution,  the  well-known  great  inflow  of  FDI7  in  SEANICs  happened  in  different 
magnitudes due to a combination of domestic and foreign features. Net inflow of FDI in Indonesia was in 
average below to 1% of GDP between 1980 and 2004, but from 2005 to 2009 it more than doubled (Table 
A9 in the Annex). In Thailand the average ratio of FDI to GDP was 2.4%, noting that between 2005 and 
2009 it reached almost 4%. Malaysia was the biggest main net FDI attractor is SEANICs, registering  as 
average ratio of 4% in the whole period and a peak of 7% between 1990 and 1995. One first important 

                                                 
7  According  to  data  from  WDI  (2011),  Malaysia  achieved  a  net  FDI  inflow  of  US$  1  billion  per  year  in  the  early  eighties, 
reaching  more than  US$ 8 billion in 2008. In Indonesia, FDI  rose from  US$ 100 million to  more than  US$ 9 billion, and in 
Thailand from less than US$ 200 million to US$ 8.5 billion in the same period. The inflow of FDI in Malaysia is prior to 1980, 
which explains its high average share of 1.7% in world FDI net inflows in the world in 1980-1984. This share shrank to less 
than  0.5%  by  1988/1989,  then  returned  to  expand  and  reached  3%  in  1992.  Since  then  Malaysian  share  at  world’s  net  FDI 
inflow retracted and stabilized at 0.4%. The share of Thailand in world net FDI inflow reached the maximum of 1.2% also in 
1992. After 1993, it fluctuated a lot and it had a decline between 2004 and 2009. Indonesia’s peak in global FDI was 1.6% in 
1996. Thai crisis and the political destabilization had dramatic consequences for FDI in Indonesia, which recorded negative net 
entry between 1997 and 2003. Then the share of global FDI in Indonesia increased again and reached 0.5% in 2008.

were designed and policies were done to attract foreign firms, for example, the set of export-processing 
zones  (EPZ),9  tax  exemptions,  export  subsidies,  and  so  on  (see  RASIAH  2003  for  an  extensive  list  of 
industrial policies). Those policies took advantage of initial conditions – another crucial internal factor - 
that  enabled  low  costs  of  production,  like  the  availability  of  cheap  labor,  energy  and  raw  materials. 
Nevertheless,  SEANICS  had  much  less  sophisticated  and  effective  industrial  policy  compared  to  NICs, 
what  accounts,  “in  no  small  way,  for  the  very  important  differences  in  industrial  and  technological 
capabilities  between  Northeast  Asia  and  Southeast  Asia”  (JOMO,  2002,  p.  10).  And  finally,  the 
macroeconomic regime also played an important role, such as will be discussed ahead in this section.10 

The source of FDI in SEANICs last decade was mostly Asian: 61% in Indonesia, 33% in Malaysia and 
66%  in  Thailand,  according  to  Thomsen,  Otsuka,  Lee  (2011)  as  it  is  presented  in  graph  4.  IMF  data 
exhibits that only in 2010, 25% of the FDI in Indonesia came from Singapore, followed by Netherlands, 
USA,  Malaysia  and  Japan.  In  Malaysia,  main  foreign  direct  investors  were    Singapore,  Japan,  USA, 
Netherlands and the UK. Meanwhile, the FDI in Thailand was mostly Japanese, followed by Singapore, 
USA, Netherlands and China.

There were geopolitical and economic external factors that contributed to leverage FDI in SEANICs. 
Geopolitical  reasons  are  not  the  focus  of  this  text,  though  they  are  undoubtedly  important.11  The 
economic  external  factors  are  related  to  trade  and  investment  regional  dynamics.  The  economic 

                                                 
8 Many types of State interventions  were done to attract FDI, such as relaxing restrictions on equity ownership, provision of 
infrastructure  etc.  But  those  countries  “performed  differently  in  the  face  of  common  opportunities  for  FDI-led  industrial 
change.  Malaysia  has  fostered  rapid  upgrading  in  the  technological  content  of  foreign  manufacturing,  but  Malaysian-owned 
industry has remained marginal in most manufacturing industries. Thailand has failed to attract higher technology FDI, but has 
preserved a modest role for Thai industrial enterprises” (JOMO, 2002, p. 14). By its turn, Indonesia engaged lately to the Asian 
FDI circuit and it shows a patter worse than Thais in terms of technological deepening in the industrialization process (HADIZ 
& ROBINSON, 2004).  
9  Which  currently  are  insignificant,  accounting  for  5%  of  total  Indonesian  exports  and  less  than  1%  in  other  SEANICs,  but 
almost 50% of Chinese exports (OECD / WTO, 2013a). 
10 One of the key reasons for high FDI investment in Malaysia is political: the government gave incentives to FDI in order to 
reduce the power of Chinese groups in the domestic economy (JOMO, 2003). 
11  Geopolitical  ones  are  related  to  the  strategic  position  of  these  countries  in  the  Pacific  Ocean,  just  in  between  powerful 
economic and political territories as China, Japan, India and Russia (and former ex-Union of Socialist Soviet Republics). This 
region  is  historically  disputed  by  the  “Great  Powers”  aiming  to  control  maritime  routes  related  to  the  profitable  West-East 
trade. Along the History, Japan made many incursions to these regions. Last  de facto Japanese domination was during the II 
World  War.  The  USA  guaranteed  the  political  independence  of  SEANICs  after  the  war,  but  since  then  Americans  try  to 
influence  the  regional  through  military,  political  and  economic  means.  After  the  War  of  Vietnam,  the  USA  widened  its 
influence  in  the  region,  settling  some  naval  and  military  basis  –  especially  in  Thailand  (CAMBRIDGE,  1992).  Xing  (2007) 
argues that US long-term strategic interest in East Asia has the dual objective of “watching” the role of Japan and “managing” 
the  risk  of  the  rise  of  China  as  a  global  and  regional  power.  The  author  also  affirm  that  in  face  of  Chinese  and  Japanese 
imperialist  interests,  the  US  role  and  presence  in  this  region  as  a  balance-of-power  guarantor  are  generally  welcome  by  the 
smaller nations.

was the devaluation of  yen exchange rate against US dollar (46% in one year, according to  IMF 2010). 
Another important  factor was the end of the preferential  investment relationship  between US and Japan 
(which was established after the war). In parallel, China had started a gradual market opening after Deng 
Xiaoping’s  reform  in  1979,  starting  a  process  of  industrial  catch-up.  Malaysia  and  Thailand  furthered 
their progressive processes of exporting manufactures to OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development), of becoming a market for Japanese exports and investments13 and, in the last decade, 
of  raw  materials  provider  for  China.  These  movements  constitute  the  basic  framework  of  the  “flying 
geese” framework.  

Traditionally  the  dynamics  of  the  regional  integration  in  Asia  involved  three  elements:  1)  a  leader 
goose  (Japan)  that  increases  its  exports  by  advancing  into  new  manufacturing  sectors  that  present  the 
highest growth rates in world markets and the stronger multiplier effect onto the domestic economy;14 2) 
consumer  markets  outside  the  group  of  geese  (US  and  Europe),  3)  and  the  latecomers  geese  (like 
SEANICs)  -  which  now  occupy  the  open  spaces  left  by  the  leader  goose  in  large  consumer  markets  of 
lower value-added manufacturing products.15 Evolving trade patterns are accompanied by new financial 
dynamics, where financial and commercial centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan were set to 
address  aggressive  strategies  of  investment  inter  and  intra  countries  of  the  Association  of  South  East 
Asian  Nations  (ASEAN).  SEANICs  initially  were  outside  the  core  of  this  dynamic,  but  after  the  Plaza 
Agreement they were incorporated into the regional investment cluster intra-industry and intra-firm trade 
– and so Bangkok, Kuala  Lumpur  and lately Jakarta progressively  became financial hubs.  The  regional 
integration brought  about  high  rate  of  growth  in  South  and  East  Asia  through  a  dynamics  in  which  the 
trade surplus with US provided the necessary foreign exchange to finance the trade deficit with Japan and 
the growth of others aggregate demand components, especially the investment, led by expansive domestic 
policies. 

However since the nineties the Asian vertical “flying-geese” model is shifting to a horizontal model of 
regional economic integration, in which the new pattern of FDI inflow constitutes a complex productive 
and  trade  network  called  “bamboo  capitalism”  or  “parallel  development”  (CHEOW,  2004  apud  XING, 
2007,  p.  14).  The  distinguishing  characteristic  of  this  system  is  the  more  complex  trade  of  parts, 
components and other intermediate products – but also of services related to the supply chain and intra-
firm  tasks  and  activities  -  related  to  global  value  chains  (GVC)  and  with  China16  at  its  core  (OCDE/ 
WTO, 2013a).17 Such a  change requires  greater  governmental  cooperation and institutional  building, so

13 This move is part of the world economy’s restructuring, of the resumption of USA hegemony and of the intensification of 
global  competition  polarized  between  the  countries  of  the  Triad  (USA,  EU  and  Japan).  Previously  based  on  an  essentially 
national export strategy, when Japan was pressured to keep an unfavorable exchange rate policy, the country has deepened and 
has  developed  a  strategy  of  productive  internationalization  to  Eastern  and  Southern  Asia.  So  there  was  the  hollowing-out  of 
manufacturing  sectors  to  the  Asian  region  through  the  increase  in  FDI  promoted  by  Japanese  conglomerates.  Similar 
phenomena is being led also by Korea, Singapore and Taiwan (MEDEIROS, 1997).  
14 “Japan was among the countries that most rapidly bottomed out from the serious structural crisis in the 1970s. Japan adopted 
the first strategy to shift leading industries to new dynamic industries and followed linear development path. Japan had been 
the most backward country among the catching-up countries in the golden age. When it lost dynamic comparative advantage in 
the heavy and chemical industries, it was able to shift towards more sophisticated machinery industry, such as automobiles and 
electrical machinery, from the mid-1970s onwards” (YOKOKAWA, 2012, p. 17) 
15  “When  the  Japanese  economy  entered  a  higher  development  stage  focusing  on  high-tech  industries  and  high  value-added 
products, it transferred its labour  intensive and part of its capital- and technology-intensive manufacturing industries to other 
East Asian countries, thus leaving itself at the far end in the spectrum of manufacturing and strengthening the character as a 
service-oriented economy. Following the rapid economic development of the first generation of East Asian NIEs and the rise 
of  their  labour  cost,  they  too  transferred  their  labour-intensive  and  part  of  its  capital-  and  technology-intensive  industries  to 
countries of Southeast Asia” (XING, 2007, p. 10). 
16  Another  peculiarity  is  the  intrinsic  nature  of  the  business  of  hundreds  of  ethnic  Chinese  family  business  and  networks 
connecting and interlocking, medium-sized businesses in many countries in the region. (XING, 2007). 
17 Actually, the higher integration of activities happened within supply chains, expanding trade processing. This phenomenon 
was  especially  strong  in  electronics  industry,  which  achieved  a  very  modularized  process  of  production  that  became  a 
benchmark to other sectors and activities too.

this is closely related to the proliferation of preferential trade agreements in Asia,18 as a part of the global 
phenomena  called  “spaghetti  bowl”  (WTO,  2011).  A  coordinated  macroeconomic  regime  is  another 
important tool of the current Asian regional integration, especially the exchange rate.  

Actually, since the Plaza Accord the dynamic of investment/ exports/ and imports relies on a consistent 
macroeconomic regime, especially a stable undervalued currency against the dollar and the yen (Figures 5 
and  6).  This  contributed  for  the  trade  surplus  achieved  that  was  notwithstanding  derived  from  huge  US 
demand and the Japanese investment. But the devalued exchange rate could not avoid financial transfers 
from  SEANICs to  the rest  of the world.  Examining their current  accounts (Annex Table A4), it is clear 
that  Indonesia  and  Thailand  recorded  negative  balances  from  1980  to  2000.  At  least  Indonesia  could 
maintain  positive  trade  balances,  while  Thailand  had  negative  net  exports  between  1980  and  1994. 
Malaysia  has  shown  deficits  in  current  transactions  only  between  1980-1984  and  1990-1994,  with  a 
robust positive trade balance.  Throughout  the eighties, the pattern of funding of these countries became 
more speculative, what  together with  the deregulation of capital  accounts, was  one of the main roots of 
the  crisis  in  1997  such  as  argues  Jomo  (2002).  Moreover  the  rise  of  Chinese  labor-intensive 
manufacturing exports partially offset these countries at end-user markets. In all SEANICs, especially in 
Thailand,  the  external  debt  along  the  nineties  became  mostly  private  (JOMO,  1998;  ARESTIS,  2003), 
resulted  from  over-investment  in  unmarketable  external  funds  that  exacerbated  the  current  account 
deficits, and increased the dependence of the industrialization to foreign capital.19 The over-indebtedness 
was  derived  both  in  the  demand  side  and  supply  side.  In  the  first  case,  it  was  motivated  by  more 
deregulated  financial  schemes  (MCKINNON  &  PILL,  1998;  FOLEY,  2003);  in  the  second  one,  it  was 
provoked  by  the  international  liquidity  and  the  financial  liberalization  of  the  nineties  that  made  easy  to 
private sectors of developing economies to borrow money abroad (MEDEIROS, 2009). So essentially, the 
largest  short-term  debt  triggered  by  the  financial  liberalization  process  -  especially  after  1995,  in  a 
scenario  of  yen  and  dollar’s  devaluation,  plus  a  highly  undervalued  yuan  -  generated  progressive 
speculative attacks on the exchange rate of the Southeast Asian countries, particularly Thai bath.

During  the crisis  SEANICs exchange rates were  drastically devalued against  the dollar. Thereafter it 
remained in a more stable situation that presented a smooth tendency of valuation against the dollar and 

                                                 
18  In  2013  there  were  more  than  300  PTAs  in  force.  Although  smaller  in  number,  the  agreements  in  Asia  present  the  wider 
rhythm  of  expansion  since  2000  is.  Asian  trade  has  the  largest  value  comparing  to  other  regions  in  the  world,  and  the 
importance of intra-regional trade is also relatively big (it grew from 42% to 52 % between 1999 and 2009). Japanese exports 
alone to the region rose from 31% to 54% in the same period (WTO, 2011). 
19  Due  to  high  capital  requirements  probably  limited  the  development  and  entrepreneurship  of  domestic  business,  as  well  as 
other local capabilities. Further the foreign exchange surplus generated by export activities was reallocated for the payment of 
financial  obligations,  instead  of  being  invested  in  productive  assets.  Thus,  the  final  effect  of  over-indebtedness  and  over 
foreign investment was a domestic investment lower than the potential.

Crisis’ effects have been different  in  scope and depth  in  the three 
countries.  Malaysia  faced  minor  consequences,20  while  Indonesia  and  Thailand  dealt  with  inflation, 
unemployment and worse poverty rates (DONER, 2009). Politically, the crisis led to the change of first 
Thai Prime Minister and the fall of Dictator Suharto in Indonesia, after more than thirty years in power. 
Thai  and  Indonesian  governments  resorted  to  loans  from  the  IMF  and  other  financial  institutions 
(including  Malaysian)  in  order  to  get  fiscal  and  debt  relief.  Therefore  they  had  to  implement  some 
economic  measures  required  by  the  Fund.  Nevertheless,  in  1998  they  were  practicing  countercyclical 
policies  to  lower  interest  rates,21  the  intensification  of  capital  controls  (GALA,  2007),  expansion  of 
budget  deficits,  the  designation  of  economic  funds  to  save  the  financial  system  and  social  security 
programs.  

In  the  second  half  of  the  2000s,  Indonesian,  Malaysian  and  Thai  exchange  rates  were  kept  devalued 
against  yen,  and  showed  a  soft  valuation  trend  in  relation  to  US  dollar.  In  parallel,  it  must  be 
acknowledged that since 1997 the yuan is floating very along to the US dollar, what means that in spite its 
undervalued  level  China’s  currency  have  had  real  valuation  in  relation  to  SEANICs  currencies.  This 
contributed  to  the  resumption  of  the  external  sector,  which  heavily  weighed  for  the  recovery  of  these 
economies in the 2000s, notwithstanding the contribution of macroeconomic policies. As discussed in the 
following section from the crisis until 2009, SEANICs presented current account surpluses, thanks to the 
recovery in exports stimulated by the rise of China.  

Macroeconomic  recovery  of  SEANICS  in  the  2000s  is  related  not  only  to  the  rise  of  commodities’ 
prices and to the persistent expansion of Chinese economy and her hungry demand, but also to the reset of 
the  FDI  in  the  region.  As  it  was  seen,  FDI  in  Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Thailand  came  especially  from 
Asia,  notably,  Singapore  and  Japan.  It  is  notable  the  share  of  the  Netherlands  and  USA  as  well,  higher 
than China’s. Though yet China is not so important in terms of FDI in the SEANICs, she is acquiring a 
major  role  in  trade.  Actually,  China  is  shaking  the  geese  model  due  to  her  fly  into  many  different 
manufacturing activities,22 from low to high technological intensities,23 and her multiple chain production 
and labour relations with many countries (XING, 2007). 
 

2)  From trade specialization in natural resources to manufacturing diversification  

 
In  the  first  half  of  the  eighties,  almost  95%  of  Indonesian  exports  were  natural  resources  (NR). 
Currently,  NR  represent  about  half  of  the  total  and  manufactures  the  other  half,  especially  textiles  and 
clothing, machinery and transport equipment and chemicals (WTO, 2011). Between 1980 and 1984, 76% 
of  Malaysian  exports  was  concentrated  in  primary  products  from  agriculture,  forestry  -  mainly  rubber  - 
and mineral ores., but at the end of the nineties it fell to 21%. The growth of manufacturing in this decade 

                                                 
20 One of the reasons for Malaysian resistance to the crisis was the prudential regulation established after a banking crisis in the 
late eighties,  which involved  new barriers to capital entry  and exit (JOMO, 2003). Secondly,  the government reduced taxes, 
especially income tax over firms. This measure contributed to the attraction of foreign firms to relocate there. Third, the State 
imposed  taxes  on  international  trade  and  non-tariff  barriers.  Fourth,  although  there  was  a  tendency  to  retract  the  operational 
budget  expenditures,  public  investment  continued  in  an  upward  trend.  The  government  has  not  canceled  or  postponed  even 
mega  projects,  a  powerful  anti-cyclical  policy.  Nevertheless  a  privatization  program  was  launched,  which  was  a  source  of 
fiscal surpluses in the years preceding the crisis. Finally, according to Jomo (1998), the government promoted banking reform 
and  recapitalized  commercial  banks,  which  contributed  to  the  recovery  of  bank  liquidity  and  allowed  a  greater  economic 
stability compared to other SEANICs. 
21 Between 1995 and 1999, interest rates rose to 5.9% in Malaysia and 8% in Thailand. Already in the 2000s, they decreased to 
2.8% in both. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, interests behaved differently, as well as inflation rates. Both variables recorded higher 
levels. The interest rate was in a high baseline over 10% between 1985 and 1995, but in 200s it drop  to 1.1 
22  “In  the  1980s  and  90s  China  did  not  follow  the  flying  geese  pattern  of  industrialization  and  promoted  industrialization  in 
many  sectors  at  once.  The  international  competitiveness  of  Chinese  light  industries,  heavy  industries,  and  machinery  were 
simultaneously improved” (YOKOKAWA, 2012, p. 18).  
23  “China’s  open-door  has  attracted  a  large  amount  of  foreign  investment  and  many  labour-intensive  and  capital-  and 
technology-intensive  industries  have  been  moved  to  China.  For  instance,  Hong  Kong  has  almost  moved  its  entire 
manufacturing  industries  to  Mainland  China  while  continuing  to  act  as  a  financial  and  service  centre.  Taiwan  and  Mainland 
China  have  developed  similar  highly  dependent  economic  relations  in  recent  years.  As  a  result  of  these  shifts,  the  regional 
growth pattern and convergence structure was also beginning to change (XING, 2007, p. 13).

was  primarily  related  to  the  subsector  of  electronic  components  and  integrated  circuits,  followed  by 
electronic  data  processing  and  electrical  equipment,  and  telecommunication  products  (WTO,  2011).  In 
turn,  the  external  insertion  of  Thailand  in  the  early  eighties  focused  on  agricultural  products  (63%), 
particularly  rice,  rubber,  jute,  maize  and  cassava  flour.  The  process  of  export  diversification  was 
leveraged  in  the  seventies,  after  the  release  of  manufactured  exports  (previously  prohibited)  in  the  III 
five-year development plan in 1972 (RASIAH, 2003). In the nineties, Thai exports of manufactures were 
already  more  diversified,  especially  electronic  goods  data  processing,  telecommunications,  apparel, 
textiles.  The  road  vehicles  industry  has  become  so  notable  that  in  the  mid-nineties  it  was  the  largest  in 
Southeast  Asia,  earning  the  nickname  "Detroit  of  Asia"  (DONER,  2009,  p.  32).  However,  while  the 
average share of manufacturing exports in the three countries was the highest in history between 2000 and 
2004  at  the  end  of  the  decade  NR  and  NR  processed  goods  regained  share.  Manufactured  exports  fell 
from 53% to 43% in Indonesia, 79% to 71% in Malaysia and only 77% to 76% in Thailand (see Table in 
the Annex). 

So  it  is  not  surprising  that  half  of  the  top  ten  exports  products  of  Malaysia  and  Thailand  are  natural 
resources,  and  in  Indonesia  the  whole  list  (Annex  Tables  A7  and  A8).  By  technological  content,  in 
Indonesia  the  primary  products  remained  stable  since  1985  with  a  share  of  20%  and  the  growth  of 
manufacturing  concentrated  in  sectors  related  to  the  NR-processed  goods  (18%  in  2005-2009).  Textiles 
and  clothing  were  important  at  the  first  stage  of  export  diversification  in  SEANICs,  especially  in 
Thailand,  but  it  continually  lost  share  in  total  exports  at  benefit  of  electronics,  telecommunications  and 
automotive  vehicles  too.  Actually  in  Thailand  and,  more  strongly,  in  Malaysia,  there  was  a  significant 
growth  of  high  and  medium  technological  intensity  manufacturing  in  exports  (see  Table  A9).  However 
technological intensity may be a misleading indicator because it includes final products that usually were 
only assembled in  the country but  did  not  added a high  amount of value domestically  (ECLAC (2007), 
OCDE/ WTO (2013a).   

The degree of sophistication in exports and the degree of its contribution to the growth of the economy 
is quite different in the three countries, given the varied share of foreign value added in the production of 
manufactured goods related to  global value chains (GVCs). According to OECD / WTO (2013a),24 two 
indicators are appropriate to measure the contribution of an individual economy to GVC. The first is the 
share of foreign value added in exports, a backward index. The other is the value-added of the domestic 
economy in the exports of other countries, which is a forward index. The sum of the two provides a proxy 
of one country’s participation in GVCs. In general smaller economies have bigger forward indexes once 
they have less ability to internally diversify production. And if an economy is promoting export-oriented 
industrialization, this trend also grows - as is the case of Malaysia, who in 2009 had 40% foreign value 
added  in  its  exports.  Thailand  was  not  far  behind,  registering  something  like  35%  (chart  7).  Whilst 
Indonesia,  like  other  big  economies  that  export  natural  resources,  such  as  Australia  and  Brazil,  showed 
lower foreign  content in  exports. China and Japan show backward indexes of about  20%, which is also 
low because of their economy’s size. Otherwise, the forward index tends to be higher in economies that 
provide inputs (including raw materials) to other countries, which is the case of the three SEANICS and 
especially Japan.  Thus, adding the two effects, it is estimated that the participation of Malaysia is one of 
the largest among developing countries at around 65%, followed by Thailand - something like 50% and 
Indonesia - 40%. Japan and China also register a total participation n GVC around 40%. 

Productive  stages  that  generate  higher  value  added  are  at  the  extremes  of  the  GVC  (OECD  /  WTO, 
2013a), still concentrated in the developed economies (in the case of Asia, Japan and Korea). As it was 
said  before,  the  hierarchical  position  of  SEANICs  (although  important  efforts  technological  capabilities 
are changing this position in a strict sense) is limited to the production of low added value manufacturing 
stages,  in  general  related  to  assembling  –  especially  in  Thailand  and  in  some  specific  manufacturing 
sectors  of  Indonesia  and  Malaysia.  Table  2  shows  that  manufacturing  is  the  sector  that  contain  most  of 
foreign  value-added  in  exports  (line  b).  Japan  presents  the  largest  domestic  value  in  exports  and  there 
manufacturing  has  the  biggest  share  in  exports’  value  (line  a).  The  share  of  domestic  value  added  in

manufacturing is around 30% of total exports in SEANICs (idem). China and SEANICs (but Indonesia in 
a lower scale25) present greater foreign value added in total exports, both in final goods and intermediate 
inputs (line d). And the domestic value added by SEANICs in final goods and intermediate inputs seems 
to  be  processed  and  re-exported  more  than  in  China  and  USA.  Japan  also  presents  a  high  share  of 
domestic value-added processed probably due to the high share of machinery in exports.

  There  is  considerable  intersection  between  the  sources  of  FDI  and  the  origin  of  imports.  In  all  three 
countries,  a  significant  portion  of  the  firms  were  foreign-owned  (RASIAH,  2003),    and  they  traced  a 
fairly clear division of labor: in Indonesia, textiles, clothing, footwear and plywood - and, more recently, 
some electronic products; Thailand, textiles and clothing , food and electronics; Malaysia, electronics and 
telecommunication  industry  (WTO  data).  Main  imports  of  SEANICs  both  1980  and  in  2010  were 
machinery and transport equipment, whose main source was Japan in 1980, but in 2010 was China (Table 
A2 in  the Annex). As stated previously, the profile of the destination of SEANICs’ exports reveals  that 
Japan  and  Korea  import  NR-processed  products  and  fuel  more  than  the  average,  while  European  and 
American imports are relatively more concentrated in machinery and transport equipment. In 1980, Japan 
and  the  USA  were  isolated  the  two  main  destinations  of  SEANICs’  exports,  but  in  2010  not  only  their 
share in have been reduced, but also have similar or even lower importance than China as a in terms of all 
product  types.  The  greater  relevance  of  Chinese  imports  and  exports  to  SEANICs  is  related  to  Chinese 
companies’ greater integration into supply chains, especially in manufacturing, relegating the production 
of low value added products to laggard geese.  
  Thus,  on  the  one  hand,  SEANICs  (along  with  China)  firmed  themselves  as  exporters  of 
"manufacturing staples" to the U.S. and Western Europe. On the other hand Japan and Korea direct their 
production of capital  goods, parts and components to the  SEANICs and other ASEAN. This means that 
SEANICs kept a trade deficit with Japan and a surplus with the U.S. in the nineties.  
  The rise of China as a major manufacturing world hub throughout the 1990s generated great impact on 
these economies as she began to absorb FDI flows and shift their exports to mayor consumer markets, but 
at the same time, due to her great scale, China has been being a key consumer market to the economies of 
the  region  (Medeiros,  2006).  Therefore,  on  the  one  hand  trade  balance  of  China  recently  (2009)  shows 
deficit with Asian countries in gross terms and almost a zero balance in value-added terms (chart A2 in 
the  Annex).  On  the  other  hand,  China  had  surplus  with  OECD  –  what  shows  the  logic  of  feeding  the 
region to make profitable in the rich markets outside it. This is exact the role that Japan played until the 
2000s,  but  now  it  has  change  because  trade  balance  shows  surplus  with  NICs,  China  and  Thailand 
(although  it  is  much  smaller  in  value-added  terms).  Just  as  YOKOKAWA  (2012,  p.  21)  shows,  “now 
China imports capital goods from Japan, Korea and Taiwan, food and raw material from less developed 
countries,  and  exports  completed  products  to  the  EU,  USA,  Asia,  and  other  areas.  The  cross-border 
division of work and trade in East Asia has been completely rebuilt by China, and the Japan-led Pacific 
Rim triangle trade regime has been replaced by a China-centric East Asian production network”. So the 
impact of China on these countries is contradictory because on the one hand Chinese companies are direct 
competitors  in  many  productive  activities,  dislocating  SEANICs  exports.  On  the  other  hand,  due  to  its 
huge  relative size, Chinese domestic market  absorbs exports of these countries,  especially of traditional 
goods.  Indeed  China’s  imports  from  SEANICS  are  propitiating  their  high  net  export  growth.  This 
dynamics constitutes, therefore, the classic vertical division of labor. 

 

3)  Consequences of the external insertion towards production and employment 

 
The direct  effect of the development of SEANICs’  external integration on the productive structure is 
clear:  nowadays  the  industrial  sector  of  Indonesia  (in  a  lower  degree),  Malaysia  and  Thailand  have 
significantly higher share in GDP than world average. However, there is huge contrast between their GDP 
and employment structures (Tables A5 and A6 in the Annex). While primary goods accounted for 9% to 
14% of value added in Indonesia and Thailand, in terms of employment it accounts to 40% of the total. In 
turn,  the  total  industrial  activity  has  an  average  weight  of  47%  in  the  value  added  of  SEANICs,  while 
employment recorded a weight of 22% in Indonesia and Thailand, and 36% in Malaysia. In services there 
was  a  more  balanced  correspondence,  with  40%  average  share  in  value  added  and  employment  in  the 
three  countries.  The  big  contingent  of  rural  employees  is  associated  to  the  precarious  process  of 
agricultural  modernization26 in  Thailand and  Indonesia. While in  Indonesia, whose percentage of arable 
                                                 
26  More  than  the  increase  in  productivity,  agricultural  modernization  is  a  complex  process  that  transforms  rural  social 
structures,  which  are  related  to  specific  geographical,  institutional  and  demographic  features.  The  true  modernization  of 
agriculture integrates the economy and reduces inequalities across sectors.

land is  similar to  Malaysia, the average farm machinery was approximately 3 per 100 km2  in  Malaysia 
this indicator was 240 (WDI, 2011). With the exception of Malaysia, where the value added per worker in 
agriculture more than doubled and grew in a pace of 3.2% per year between 1980 and 2010, in the other 
countries the growth rate was lower: 2.3% in Thailand and 1.6% in Indonesia (WDI, 2011). Thus the low 
productivity  in  agriculture  is  an  issue  that  suggests  that  in  Thailand,  and  more  severely  in  Indonesia, 
structural heterogeneity remains27. 

The  exam  of  the  productive  structure  also  leads  to  this  conclusion.  Comparing  the  current 
configuration  of  manufacturing  value-added  (MVA)  at  Table  3,  there  is  a  significant  contrast  between 
manufacturing  industries  across  SEANICs.  Indonesia  has  a  strong  food  and  beverage  industry,  which 
accounted for nearly half of the production of the manufacturing industry in  2009. Noteworthy are also 
the  industry  of  refined  oil,  coke  and  nuclear  energy,  metal  products  and  motor  vehicles.  The  vehicle 
industry, incidentally, has similar weight in the three countries, being a little less significant in Malaysia. 
In  Malaysia,  the  main  industries  are  telecommunications,  refined  oil,  food  and  beverages,  rubber  and 
plastics  and  chemicals.  In  Thailand,  main  industries  are  office  equipment,  measuring  and  counting 
(computers), food and beverages,  clothing and vehicles. Moreover, contrasting the industry composition 
of  these  countries  against  the  world,  it  may  be  concluded  that  Malaysia  is  more  in  line  to  the  world’s 
average  -  especially  with  regard  to  the  importance  of  high-tech  industry  of  telecommunications 
(communications equipment, television and radio) - whose MVA share is 27%.

Many contrasts are also clear in the labour market. Sub-sectors that concentrate more labour-force in 
Indonesia  are  textiles  and  clothing,  food  and  tobacco  (Table  4).  Indonesian  wages  are  the  lowest 

                                                 
27  As  put  by  Lewis  (1954),  dualism  (as  we  here  referred  as  structural  heterogeneity)  happens  in  underdeveloped  economies 
when  a  small  part  of  the  workforce  is  in  modern  capitalist  sector  (the  sector  of  tradable  products,  usually  commodities),  in 
which  labour  is  relatively  well-paid  and  presents  high  productivity.  The  other  part  of  the  work-force  lives  in  a  subsistence 
activities in rural or in backward urban services (the non-tradable sectors) under low wages and productivity. So the economy 
operates with elastic supply of labor, low pressure in wages, and low levels of investment per worker and productivity growth.

comparing to  SEANICs  and CHINA  and represent  a small portion of the value added of each industry. 
Thus, the share of wages in  major industries in 2009 was less  than 14%, and the ratio annual  wage per 
employee  was  between  U.S.  $  1,122  and  U.S.  $  1,825.  In  Malaysia,  the  industries  that  employ  more 
generate  greater  value-added  than  the  ones  prevalent  in  Indonesia,  enabling  greater  share  of  wages  in 
Malayan value added, with the average salary being nearly five times higher than Indonesian. The largest 
subsectors  in  terms  of  employment  in  Thailand  are  similar  both  to  Malaysia  and  Indonesia:  textiles, 
processed  meats  and  fats,  valves  and  tubes  and  plastic.  Average  wages  are  low,  though  higher  than 
Indonesian wages. It should be noted that currently the average wage in China is above Indonesian’s and 
Thailand’s,  but  lower  than  the  Malaysian.  This  gap  between  productivity  and  wages  translates  the 
dominance  of  the  export  strategy  in  recent  years  in  SEANICs,  and  thus  a  source  of  economic 
vulnerability.

The technological content of the productive structures of the three countries is associated to the export 
sector,  and  therefore  to  the  FDI  and  multinational  companies.  As  it  was  shown  until  a  certain  extent 
foreign  activity  in  SEANICs  perform  only  assembly  stages,  relegating  technology-intensive  stages  to 
other locations.28 Jomo (2002, p. 13) argues that greater Southeast Asian dependence on FDI compared to 
NICs  “raises  disturbing  questions  about  the  actual  nature  of  industrial  and  technological  capacities  and 
capabilities in these countries, especially in their most dynamic and export-oriented sectors. This, in turn, 
raises concerns about the sustainability of their growth and industrialization processes, especially if they 
                                                 
28  According  to  OECD/  WTO  (2013b),  foreign  content  in  Indonesian  exports  from  is  more  significant  in  machinery  and 
equipment (40%), electrical and optical equipment (27%) and textiles / footwear / leather (26% in 2009). Total foreign value 
added  in  Indonesian  exports  is  originated  in  the  European  Union  (38%),  China  (11%),  Japan  (10%)  and  the  USA  (8%). 
Unfortunately there is no data available for Malaysia and Thailand.

are  later  deemed  less  attractive  as  sites  for  further  FDI,  e.g.  as  more  attractive  alternative  locations 
become available”. So on the one hand the State in SEANICs had a key role in the economic development 
in  terms  of  planning  and  industrial  policy,  fostering  important  institutions  to  diversify  manufacturing 
production and trade, and contributing directly to the injection of income into the economy via increase in 
public spending and investment. But States in these countries did not build strong institutions similar to 
those  built  by  the  first  East  Asian  developmental  state  centered  on  technological  upgrading  and 
endogenous technology. Geopolitical and internal reasons, (as the role played by land classes and by the 
associated  commercial  and  industrial  groups)  prevented  Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Thailand  to  follow  a 
better route for industrialization like Japan and NICs. 
 
Final notes 

Over  the  years  trade  diversification  of  SEANICs  by  their  integration  in  regional  production  chains 
resulted  in  high  exports  growth  rate,  which  was  associated  to  massive  imports  and  was  led  by  high 
inflows  of  foreign  direct  investment  and  public  investment.  This  dynamics  enabled  sustained  economic 
growth, though structurally unbalanced and vulnerable. The relatively high productivity of manufacturing 
exports does not reflect the existence of sophisticated techniques but stems mainly from the combination 
of  foreign  investment  and  cheap  labor  mainly  employed  in  labor-intensive  activities,29  maintaining  a 
standard  of  competition  focused  on  low  labor  costs  and  on  the  undervalued  exchange  rate.  SEANICs 
development is strongly related to the regional productive integration led by Japan. Indonesia, Malaysia 
and Thailand are important consumer markets for high-value added manufactures from Japan (and NICs) 
and  they  provide  raw  materials  and  inputs  for  the  production  of  higher  value-added  manufactures, 
especially  capital  goods,  parts  and  components  in  Japan  and  China  more  recently.  The  market  for  their 
labour-intensive  manufacture  goods  are  basically  the  USA  and  Europe.  Thus  generically  speaking 
SEANICS are in charge of low value-added activities, that are not intensive in knowledge nor technology. 
This  development  model  has  a  dependent  nature  and  still  faces  serious  structural  problems  such  as  low 
technological and knowledge capability, FDI dependence and productivity lags in non-tradable sectors. 

SEANICs’ development pattern and external insertion have been impacted by the rise of China, which 
generated  growing  rivalry  in  the  labor-intensive  manufacturing  industry,  but  at  the  same  time  has 
increased  the  demand  for  exports  of  goods  based  on  NR  and  manufactures  articulated  to  GVC.  At  the 
present,  this  growth  pattern  shows  several  critical  points.  Indeed,  since  the  2008  crisis,  the  reduced 
growth of industrialized economies has led to increased competition among manufacture exporters and an 
even  greater  predominance  of  China  in  these  markets.  Rising  wages  in  China  allows  some  survival  to 
SEANIC’s pattern of external  insertion, however  hardly this condition will reduce vulnerability and the 
dilemmas  that  mark  this  type  of  economic  growth.  Thus,  the  search  for  another  type  of  development 
where further expansion of real wages is combined to investments to build another insertion model based 
on activities of higher technological content and higher value added is the main challenge to maintaining 
sustainable development in these economies and to overcome the structural difficulties related to low per 
capita  income,  urbanization  and  the  heterogeneity  between  the  tradable  and  non-tradable  sectors.  A 
possibly  alternative  growth  strategy  may  rest  in  the  enforcement  of  domestic  economic  and  industrial 
policies  that  historically  were  important  for  their  industrialization,  such  as  public  investment,  rise  of 
minimum wages, credit expansion, and others that had strengthen national consumption and investment. 
These  policies  could  contribute  for  a  higher  employment  in  manufacturing,  and  they  constitute  a 
distinguishing  determinant  of  the  economic  growth  strategy less  dependent  on  exports  growth  as  it 
happens  in  the  dismal  performance  observed  in  Mexico  and  others  national  strategies  limited  to 
production of low value industrial activities. 

Usual developmental literature emphasizes the importance of manufacturing diversification to generate 
high  growth  rates  and  a  higher  degree  of  homogeneity  across  economic  activities.  Allegedly  the  higher 
share of manufacturing in exports and in the productive structure may propitiate that more people benefit 
from  technological  progress,  moreover;  it  could  allow  technological  catch  up.  SEANICs’  cases 
demonstrate  that  this  is  not  necessarily  true.  These  processes  were  experienced  in  a  small  scale  there 
                                                 
29 Export sectors have low linkage effects in the domestic economy, according to some calculation made out of input-output 
matrices in Reis (2012).

during  the  years  of  structural  change  from  natural  resources  into  manufacturing  products.  In  times 
characterized  by  great  expansion  of  productive  chains,  simply  integrating  to  them  may  generate  some 
growth and export diversification. However, the  key  challenge is  to  assume a key  position in  the  GVC. 
The more distant is it from technical progress, the more elusive is the industrialization as a process that 
lifts  income  and  spills  over  technical  progress.  So  once  SEANICs  industries  are  not  in  a  privileged 
position  in  global  value  chains,  their  manufacture  development  did  not  guarantee  the  overcoming  of 
structural heterogeneity nor the technological catch-up.
