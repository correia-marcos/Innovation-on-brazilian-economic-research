Abstract 
Devolution of fiscal capacity has been considered by governments all around the world 
an important force behind economic dynamism of sub-national regions. Since its last 
constitution in 1988, Brazil has been engaged in a controversial devolutionary. This 
paper aims understanding the relation of devolution and quality of institutions with 
economic, contributing to the current debate of to what extent, if any, and in which 
context should the Brazilian government devolve more fiscal capacity to this lower 
level of government. Using a new measure for devolution and considering institutional 
differences according to the evolutionary path of each Brazilian region, this paper 
applies an IV analysis and finds that, when good institutional quality is in place, 
devolution is positively related to economic growth. Therefore, in order to reap the 
benefits of any additional devolution, the Brazilian government should pay attention to 
the institutional arrangement of municipalities.

Resumo 
A devolução da capacidade fiscal do governo central para as subnacionais do país tem 
sido considerada em todo o mundo como uma força importante por trás do dinamismo 
econômico destas regiões. Desde a constituição de 1988, o Brasil tem se envolvido em 
um controverso processo devolutivo. Este artigo visa compreender a relação entre 
devolução, qualidade das instituições e crescimento econômico. Contribuindo, desta 
forma, para o debate atual de até que ponto, e em que contexto o governo deveria 
transferir mais capacidade fiscal para suas subunidades. Propondo uma nova medida de 
desconcentração e considerando diferenças institucionais de acordo com o caminho 
evolutivo de cada região brasileira, este trabalho aplica a técnica de variáveis 
instrumentais e encontra que, havendo instituições fortes, a devolução está 
positivamente relacionada ao crescimento econômico. Portanto, para obter os benefícios 
de qualquer desconcentração adicional, o governo brasileiro deve prestar atenção ao 
arranjo institucional dos municípios.

Introduction 
 

A trend towards many types of decentralization has affected the entire world over 
the past 40 years (Rodríguez-Pose & Gill 2005). Despite varying drastically from one 
country  to  another,  different  decentralizing  processes  can  be  categorized  into  three 
different discourses with regards to their motivations: the identity, the good governance 
and the economic efficiency discourses (Rodríguez-Pose & Sandall 2008). This study will 
focus  on  the  economic  efficiency  discourse  that  has  appeared  more  frequently  in  the 

recent years as a response to the effects of globalization. In a globalization process, the 
capacity of regions to engage in territorial competition becomes an important feature of 
the current world (Agnew 2001) as there is a common understanding that localities and 
municipalities  are  “the  most  suitable  places  to  achieve  economic  dynamism  in  a 
globalized  world”  (Rodríguez-Pose  &  Sandall  2008,  p.58).  This  discourse  is  closely 
related to the “new regionalism” agenda and its argument that devolution is a matter of 
counterbalancing  the  “economic  and  democratic  deficit”  of  regions  as  sub-national 
governments are better prepared to improve economic dynamism and to promote more 
accountable, participatory and transparent government (Tiebout 1956; Musgrave 1959; 
Oates 1972; Keating 1998; Morgan 2002). 

Devolution could be defined as the statutory delegation of powers from the central 
government of a sovereign state to govern at a subnational level, such as a regional or 
local level. Devolution is a broader concept than decentralization because it corresponds 
to the return to municipalities not only of the revenue collected from its residents, but also 
the ability of these to collect taxes and to take responsibility for the expenses that occur 
in the municipalities.  It is a form of administrative decentralization.  

However, some paper suggested that the devolution performances depends on the 
degree of development of the country. There are studies that indicate increases in costs 
and losses in efficiency resulting from devolution (Costa-Font, Moscone, 2008 Crivelli; 
Leive; Stratmann, 2010). Some studies for countries with decentralized systems show 
inequalities in access and use between regions, favorable to the richest regions (Jiménez-
Rubio,  Smith,  van  Doorslaer,  2008).  There  are  also  results  of  positive  impacts  of 
decentralization on equity financing, but not so clear about the use of services (Bossert et 
al, 2003). 

 The current discourse is that, for the case of municipalities, governments have a 
certain level of responsibilities that is below the financial resources available to them, 
therefore more devolution is necessary. In this scenario of an imbalance of resources and 
responsibilities and a real possibility of movement towards changing these conditions, 
this paper aims at contributing to the ongoing discussion of to what extent, if any, and in 
which  context  should  the  Brazilian  federal  and  state  government  devolve  more  fiscal 
capacity  to  municipalities.  For  this  purpose,  this  paper  posits  the  following  research 
question: what is the relation of devolution and quality of institutions with GDP per capita 
growth of Brazilian municipalities from 2005 to 2012? Based on a strand of the literature 
that will be further discussed, this paper has defined the following hypothesis: devolution 
and good quality of institutions together at municipal level are positively correlated to 
higher rates of GDP per capita growth in the analyzed period (from 2005 to 2012). 

This research intends to be innovative and contribute to the literature on this topic 
in four aspects. Firstly, it creates a new measure for devolution at the municipal level that 
overcomes some of the possible caveats of other proxies used for devolution at this level 
of government. Secondly, it applies a line of reasoning similar to what Acemoglu et al. 
(2001)  proposed,  differentiating  the  quality  of  institutions  across  Brazilian  regions 
according to their process of colonization. Studies on devolution are normally conducted 
at  state  level  due  to  availability  of  data,  thus  the  analysis  of  devolution  itself  at  the 
municipal  level  is  a  third  contribution.  Lastly,  this  research  interacts  devolution  and 
regional  quality  of  institutions  to  better  understand  the  relation  of  devolution  and 
municipal economic growth. This research applies fixed effect with instrumental variable 
model to help us understanding some important aspects of the proposed research question. 
This  paper  first  reviews  the  theoretical  discussion  about  devolution  and  quality  of 
institutions and present how these two topic have evolved in the Brazilian context. Then 
it presents how the new measure for devolution was created and what are the assumptions 

considered  with  regards  to  quality  of  institutions  of  Brazilian  geographical  regions. 
Moreover, it will also discuss the strategy of analysis as well as the econometric model 
for  the  regressions.  Forth,  it  will  present  the  results  and  discussion.  Finally,  some 
conclusions.  

. 
Devolution, Institutions and Economic Growth 
  
The mechanisms that are claimed to make local governments better capable of 
achieving economic development are under an overarching idea that devolution increases 
the  overall  efficiency  of  regions,  a  factor  that  is  likely  to  induce  economic  growth 
(Martinez-Vazquez & McNab 2003). Efficiency, in turn, is defined as the ability of local 
governments to maximize the allocation and production of resources (Rodríguez-Pose & 
Bwire 2003). The allocative efficiency is related to the capacity of local governments to 
better  allocate  resources  across  the  needs  of  their  territories  while  the  production 
efficiency is the capacity of governments to deliver services and goods at a lower unitary 
cost when compared to other tiers of governments. All in all, if local governments are in 
a better position to achieve these allocative and productive efficiencies, devolution makes 
sense as it is likely that the efficiency gains will be reflected in positive economic results 
(Rodríguez-Pose & Bwire 2003). 

Once  understood  that  the  link  between  devolution  and  economic  growth  is  to 
increase allocative and productive efficiency of governments, clarifying the mechanisms 
underlying this link is the next step. Tiebout (1956) explains that local governments are 
more capable of identifying the preferences of their citizens, a fact that leads to a better 
allocation of resources. This supposedly better allocative capability ends up increasing 
the efficiency of local governments as there is a reduction of provision of services that 
are not necessary according to the local conditions. For instance, one municipality might 
be in need of a more robust health system due to a peculiarity (e.g. in a region with high 
incidence of “Dengue Fever”), but the federal government allocates more resources to 
education  due  to  a  top-down  nation-wide  policy.  In  this  case,  if  fiscal  capacity  were 
devolved,  the  municipal  government  would  be  able  to  better  allocate  the  financial 
resources  according  to  its  needs.  Another  important  mechanism  is  related  to  the 
competition that is induced by devolution (Tiebout 1956). This argument relies in the 
assumption that citizens are mobile and decide where to live according to a cost-benefit 
analysis  of  their  preferences  and  places’  living  costs  (Tiebout  1956).  In  this  sense,  if 
municipalities can have full power on their budget, they might compete with one another 
to provide the best services at the lowest cost possible with the aim of attracting citizens 
to their territory, a process that increases municipal efficiency.  

Another  important  mechanism  that  increases  the  efficiency  of  municipalities 
through devolution is the creation of an environment within the municipal administration 
that is more prone to innovation (Breton 1983; Thiessen 2003; Rodríguez-Pose & Bwire 
2003). This innovation environment is a result of two forces that are related to devolution 
towards local governments. The first is that, according to what was previously mentioned, 
municipalities  will  compete  with  one  another  in  order  to  provide  the  best  services  at 
lowest costs. This competition leads to innovation of processes, products and business 
models aiming at either improving services or reducing costs. The second is that, as local 
governments  act  in  a  much  smaller  scale  than  central  governments,  the  effects  and 
possible failures, which are the most likely result of any attempt to innovate, are also 
much smaller. Therefore, as the risk of failure is reduced, local governments are more 
willing to innovate than central governments. For instance, Brazilian municipalities are 
partnering  with  Non-Governmental  Organizations  (NGOs)  in  order  to  facilitate  the 

provision of some health services. As municipalities have their own legislative power, 
they created the legal framework for this initiative very quickly and were also rapid to 
adequate it in the case possible failures that might happen. A similar initiative coming 
from the federal government would be more complex to implement as legislation would 
be valid for all Brazilian municipalities, increasing the impacts of any failure, and would 
have  to  be  under  scrutiny  of  federal  legislative  power,  diminishing  the  flexibility  of 
adaptation of the legal framework as federal legislative power is much less responsive to 
municipalities’ needs.  

The informational advantage that municipal governments are claimed to have is 
also  important  on  understanding  the  arguments  that  support  the  connection  between 
devolution and economic growth of devolved localities (Klugman 1994).  The idea behind 
this argument is that local agents (public leaders, politicians, public servants, and others) 
are much better informed about the conditions of their municipalities when compared to 
central  governments.  Therefore,  when  there  is  this  inadequacy  or  asymmetry  of 
information,  it  is  harder  for  central  governments  to  make  decisions  and  evaluate  the 
impacts  of  these  decisions  in  an  administrative  and  political  position  that  is  far  from 
localities (Klugman 1994). This situation might lead to losses of efficiency when power 
is centralized in the hands of the central government. The last mechanism to mention is 
the improvement of efficiency due to better accountability and transparency that a process 
of devolution might lead (Klugman 1994; Rodríguez-Pose & Bwire 2003). Devolving 
fiscal capacity puts the tier of government directly responsible for the expenditure and 
provision of services much closer to the recipients of these services. This proximity, in 
turn, might lead to better transparency and accountability. According to Rodríguez-Pose 
& Bwire (2003, p.1910), fostering transparency and accountability “reduces bureaucratic 
complexity  and  increases  citizens'  monitoring  capacity,  stimulating  further  efficiency 
gains”. Transparency and accountability might also contribute to an improvement in the 
institutional conditions as they enhance trust among actors within an specific context 
(Putnam  et  al.  1994).  An  environment  with  more  trust  contributes  positively  for  the 
delivery of public policies “by decreasing the costs of collective action and increasing the 
benefits of cooperation” (Rodríguez-Pose & Bwire 2003, p.1910). 

On the other side of the debate, there are scholars who criticize the positive effects 
of devolution (Breton 1983; Prud’homme 1995; Rodden 2003; Rodríguez-Pose & Bwire 
2003; Morgan 2002). Against the argument that local governments are more efficient than 
central  governments,  Prud’homme  (1995)  posits  that  this  can  only  be  true  when 
economies  of  scale  are  not  relevant  for  the  service  provision.  By  concentrating  the 
demand of many localities, central governments have more bargaining power, therefore 
can negotiate better unitary costs and be more cost-efficient. A second argument against 
devolution  is  that  the  local  governments  might  be  more  subject  to  elite  capture  and 
corruption than central governments are. It is argued that local politicians are more likely 
to  be  influenced  by  pressing  demands  from  local  interest  groups  “in  matters  such  as 
taxation  and  authorization”  and  that  national  politicians  and  bureaucrats  have  less 
discretion than their local counterparts (Prud’homme 1995, p.211). Devolution is also 
criticized by the fact that it might create overlapping functions and power in the public 
administrative system (Breton 1983) and this can create ambiguity of responsibilities and 
increase  the  administrative  costs  of  governments,  two  factors  that  reduce  the  overall 
efficiency of the system (Rodríguez-Pose & Bwire 2003). Another important critique of 
devolving fiscal capacity is that local governments might lack qualified human resources 
that  are  able  to  effectively  manage  complex  tasks  and  services.  Prud’homme  (1995) 
suggests  that  national  governments  are  more  likely  to  offer  better  salaries,  create 

attractive careers, and to have scale to invest in technologies that can help on the delivery 
of services.  

Along with the devolution trend that is claimed to lead to a better condition of 
regions in the pursuit of higher levels economic growth, there is an emerging consensus 
that institutions matter for regional development (Rodríguez-Pose 2013). In a broader 
sense, institutions are for now defined as “the rules of the game in a society or, more 
formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction” (North 1990, 
p.3). More recently, even within mainstream economists, institutions have gained primary 
importance for economic growth (Acemoglu et al. 2005). For instance, Rodrik (2004) 
recognizes that, despite the caveats on the understanding of which direction the causality 
mechanism  works  in  the  case  of  high-quality  institutions  and  economic  growth, 
institutions are crucial when assessing the determinants of growth of regions. In a study 
sponsored by World Bank to clarify the importance of institutions in the quality of the 
decentralization process in seven different countries, Parker & Serrano (2000, p.26) stated 
that “from an operational perspective, having enough capacity to get the job done is one 
of  the  biggest  challenges  confronting  local  institutions”.  Several  important  reports  on 
development  such  as  Barca  (2009)  have  emphasized  that  the  reason  why  traditional 
development  policies  have  failed  is  the  constant  neglection  of  institutional  context  of 
underdeveloped regions.   

Despite the agreement that having the right institutions leads to more successful 
strategies  of  economic  growth,  the  type  institutions  that  matters  and  what  are  the 
mechanisms  through  which  this  connection  works  are  still  under  development 
(Rodríguez-Pose  2013).  Departing  from  the  more  general  definition  of  institutions 
presented by North (1990), Rodríguez-Pose (2013, p.5) presents the concept separated 
into two: formal institutions (“hard” or “society” institutions) such as rule of law and 
property rights, and informal institutions (“soft” or “communities” institutions) such as 
norms,  traditions  and  social  conventions.  With  regards  to  more  formal  aspects  of 
institutions, the improvement of rule of law, property rights, quality of public servants 
and others can lead to more accountable and transparent governments that, in turn, are 
more  likely  to  implement  quality  and  efficient  policies  (Rodríguez-Pose  &  Garcilazo 
2015). For instance, Acemoglu et al. (2005) demonstrate that property rights are highly 
related to better income levels. In relation to more informal aspects of institutions, social 
capital  and  trust  work  reducing  the  transaction  costs  when  there  is  asymmetry  of 
information  (Fukuyama  2000).  Better  informal  institutions  such  as  sharing  the  same 
culture,  religion  and  values  facilitate  the  cooperation  between  individuals  and 
organizations  and  promotes  the  associational  life  that  is  necessary  for  the  success  of 
governments (Fukuyama 2000, p.1).  

 
Background of Brazil 
 
As devolutionary processes are normally very distinct from each other and depend 
on  the  context  of  the  region  where  it  happens  (Rodríguez-Pose  &  Gill  2003),  it  is 
important to discuss the particular elements of this process in the case of Brazil. 

In 2012, the final year of analysis of this study, the fiscal capacity of the federal, 
state  and  municipal  governments  were  57.5%,  24.4%  and  18%,  respectively  (Afonso 
2013).  This  data  shows  that,  during  this  period,  subnational  governments,  in  special 
municipalities,  not  only  gained  responsibilities  as  previously  demonstrated,  but  also 
financial resources to deliver public policies. Municipal governments almost tripled their 
fiscal capacity from 1960 (6.4%) to 2012 (18%). However, simply understanding the 
level of financial resources that are spent at local level might lead to wrong conclusions 

as  it  is  possible  to  have  similar  levels  of  financial  resources  available  at  local 
governments,  but  completely  different  types  of  devolution  due  to  the  way  that  fiscal 
capacity  was  devolved  (Rodríguez-Pose  &  Gill  2003).  In  the  case  of  Brazilian 
municipalities, which is the focus of this study, one particularity to understand is that 
devolution has been mainly implemented through transfers of resources from federal and 
state governments and not through devolution of capacity to collect taxes locally. The 
revenue  generated  locally  comes  from  few  types  of  revenue  sources  that  are,  in  the 
majority  of  municipalities,  inexpressive  when  compared  to  the  overall  expenditure  of 
these  municipal  governments,  especially  in  less  developed  regions  of  the  country. 
Therefore,  with  the  fiscal  gap  at  local  level,  municipalities  are  highly  dependent  on 
transfers. Table 1 represents the fiscal gap in the structure of revenue and fiscal capacity 
in Brazil in the year of 2000, allowing us to identify that only 5.1% of the overall revenue 
is collected at municipal level, the rest of the 17% of financial resources available to 
municipalities was comprised of transfers from the central and state governments.

In order to understand the other specificities about the devolutionary process in 
Brazil at municipal level, it is important to analyze in details how the fiscal capacity of 
municipalities, the previously mentioned 17% in table 1, is comprised. This study will 
make these more specific considerations for the years of 2005 and 2012 because they 

reflect the period analyzed. It is possible to see from table 2 that out of the total fiscal 
capacity of municipalities, the share that comes from taxes collected locally (Local taxes) 
in 2012 was 19%, a value that is higher than in 2005, but is still very low. The municipal 
governments at poorer regions, Northeast and North, rely even less on local taxes and 
their revenue from this source was 11% and 12%, respectively. The municipalities in 
Southeast have a much higher share of its fiscal capacity coming from local taxes: 23% 
in  2012.  Another  relevant  aspect  is  the  importance  of  the  federal  government  in  the 
transfer of financial resources to municipalities. Of the 65.9% of the transfers from other 
levels  of  government  in  2012,  the  most  important  source  is  federal  government  with 
28.7% of the total (central government transfers are also part of the Multi-level transfers). 
In table 2 is also possible to see the non-constitutional transfers which are resources that 
are  transferred  on  the  bases  of  specific  partnerships  among  levels  of  government  to 
implement  programmers.  These  transfers  contributed  with  only  1%  of  the  total  fiscal 
capacity of municipalities in 2012.

The  last  crucial  point  to  mention  is  the  conditionality  that  are  in  place  when 
municipalities  are  executing  their  fiscal  capacity.  The  first  conditionality  is  that 
municipalities  must  spend  25%  of  all  their  current  revenue  in  the  development  of 
education  (Constitution  of  Brazil  1988).  Still  related  to  education,  the  FUNDEB 
(Maintenance  Fund  for  Development  and  Support  of  Professionals  in  the  Education 
System), which is one of the most important line of transfers of resources from other 
levels of government to municipalities and is part of the Multi-level transfers in table 4, 
must have at least 60% of all its resources applied to salaries of professors (Constitution 
of Brazil 1988). With regards to the health system, governments of municipalities must 
invest at least 15% of their current revenue in services and programmers related to health 
(Constitutional  Amendment  29  2000).  With  regards  to  expenditures  in  personnel,  the 

Fiscal  Responsibility  Law  regulates  the  expenditure  in  all  levels  of  government.  At 
municipal level, public administration cannot spend more than 60% of its current revenue  
with  personnel  and  this  60%  is  divided  into  54%  for  Executive  power  and  6%  for 
Legislative  power  (Complementary  Law  Number  101  2000).  The  overall  Legislative 
expenditure is also regulated by the Constitutional Amendment number 25/2000 in which 
it  demands  that  minimum  percentages  of  financial  resources  be  channeled  from  the 
Executive to Legislative power. These percentages vary from 8% in municipalities with 
less than 100,000 inhabitants to 5% in municipalities with more than 500,000 inhabitants 
(Constitutional Amendment 25 2000). This list of conditionalities is not exhaustive, but 
are enough to demonstrate that, despite having increased the fiscal capacity at municipal 
level, local governments are highly restricted and controlled on where and how to spend. 
All in all, the general sense for municipalities and politicians at municipal level, despite 
having gained fiscal capacity over the last years, is that municipalities should get more 
power  in  terms  of  financial  resources  and  autonomy.  The  Brazilian  Constitutional 
Transfer is call Fundo de Participação dos Minicípios- FPM and we are exploring their 
exogenous in our identification strategy. 

 

Quality of Institutions 

 
According  to  Rodríguez-Pose  (2013),  measuring  institutions  is  virtually 
impossible.  Finding  plausible  measures  to  proxy  institutions  at  municipal  level  in  a 
developing  country  is  even  more  complex.  Therefore,  this  research  will  first  present 
arguments that substantiate why the institutional panorama of Brazilian municipalities is 
diverse and then, based on these arguments, will assign to each Brazilian region a more 
general proxy for institutions that will be assumed to be the same for all the municipalities 
in that region. Table 3 summarizes the assumptions of quality of institutions for each of 
the 3 regions. The first argument that explains the existence of this institutional diversity 
in Brazil is related to the political and legislative autonomy that municipalities acquired 
after  the  1988  Constitution.  According  to  Article  30  of  the  1988  Constitution,  it  is 
responsibility  of  municipalities  “to  legislate  on  subjects  of  local  interest”  and  “to 
supplement federal and state legislation where applicable”, so localities can legislate on 
various  topics  such  as  Service  Taxes  (ISS)  and  Urban  Property  Taxes  (IPTU) 
(Constitution of Brazil 1988). Article 31 states that the control of the municipality shall 
be exercised by the municipal Legislative power (Constitution of Brazil 1988) and this 
involves  activities  such  as  the  approval  of  the  actions  and  expenditures  of  the  local 
Executive  power.  In  some  cases,  there  is  also  the  involvement  of  other  levels  of 
government  when  necessary,  but  local  Legislative  powers  are  the  first,  and  in  many 
remote areas of the country the only, instance of control of the Executive Power. The 
possibility of legislating at municipal levels and this check-and-balance system under the 
responsibility of Legislative power are subject to political, cultural and social conditions 
of localities, a fact that leads to diverse and unique institutional arrangements across the 
country.  For  instance,  alliances  among  politicians  and  public  servants  from  the 
Legislative  and  Executive  powers  in  one  municipality  might  create  an  informal 
institutional context prone to corruption where the law enforcement supposedly applied 
by the Legislative power is ineffective. Or, without violating the law and more related to 
a formal institutional aspect, local legislation can pass specific laws such as the increase 
of Service Taxes (ISS) and Urban Property Taxes (IPTU) that might inhibit economic 
activity. These two examples show how the legislative autonomy of local governments 
might lead to a diversity of institutions across municipalities that are in the same country 
and ruled by the same constitution.   

The second argument is related to the way that the 5 Brazilian regions evolved 
since Brazilian colonization. According to Acemoglu et al. (2001, p: 1370), regions that 
were subject to different types of colonization might have developed different institutions 
“that  persisted  even  after  independence”.  For  instance,  on  the  one  hand,  the  Belgian 
colonization of Congo had an exploratory focus, therefore the macro-institutions taken to 
the colonized country were scarce and did not introduce important institutional aspects 
such as private property; while, on the other hand, British colonization of Australia did 
not have an exploratory focus and, therefore, introduced in the colonized country much 
better macro-institutions (Acemoglu et al. 2001).  In the case of Brazil, despite having a 
single colonizer – Portugal – thus supposedly acquiring the same macro-institutions from 
its  colonizer,  micro  and  geographic  characteristics  influenced  the  way  institutional 
arrangements were consolidated over time within the country (Naritomi et al. 2009). 

Naritomi et al. (2009, p.20) shows that for Brazilian municipalities “geography 
alone explains 65, 30, and 20 percent of the variation in, respectively, ln income per 
capita, governance and land Gini”. At the beginning of the Brazilian colonial period, 
distance  from  Portugal  was  a  very  important  factor  in  the  decision  of  which  areas  to 
explore first and due to this proximity, the Northeast region was the first to be explored 
(Naritomi et al. 2009). First with the extraction of wood (Pau-Brasil) and then with the 
plantation of sugar-cane and production of sugar, a period named the Sugar Economic 
Cycle, Portugal imposed to Brazil two very extractive activities. These activities were 
mainly based on slavery, large rural properties in the hands of few, a patriarchal society, 
and the practice of rent-seeking activities (Naritomi et al. 2009, p.8). Thus, based on these 
extractive colonial origins of the Northeast region and on the arguments presented by 
Acemoglu et al. (2001), Brazilian municipalities in that region are likely have a different 
institutional  arrangement  that  is  more  fragile  and  less  effective  than  other  Brazilian 
regions that had different colonization and settlement processes. 

The less populated of the Brazilian regions, the North, only started increasing its 
population during XIX century. Up to this century, the region was mainly inhabited by 
indigenous  people  in  an  immense  geographic  area  within  the  Amazon  Basin  (IBGE 
2016). From 1840 to 1910, the Rubber Cycle, an also very extractive economic activity 
in the Amazon forest, created a migration influx to the states of this region. People from 
the Northeast region and Japanese immigrants moved to municipalities of the North to 
engage  in  the  extraction  of  rubber.  This  initiative  was  short-lived  and  did  not  bring 
institutional  and  sustainable  economic  development  for  that  region.  More  recently, 
aiming  at  increasing  the  population  and  development  of  this  region,  the  Brazilian 
government  started  two  development  programmes:  the  first  was  the  creation  of  a 
development agency dedicated to the North region named SUDAM and the second was 
the creation of a manufacturing pole with lots of tax incentives named Zona Franca de 
Manaus.  These  two  initiatives  also  triggered  a  migratory  influx  to  that  area  and 
contributed to the formation of its population. However, even with all these efforts, the 
North region is not yet economically developed, neither densely populated. The region 
has many remote municipalities where government and formal institutions such as public 
organizations are less present. Based on these facts, this research considers that the quality 
of institutions in this region is similar to that of que Northeast region.      

Different from the type of colonization suffered from the North and Northeast 
regions,  the  Southeast  and  South  regions  were  not  under  “constant  and  direct 
intervention” from Portugal and its extractive activities during the colonial period. In this 
direction, Naritomi et al. (2009, p.5) states that “in these areas history was connected to 
activities developed by settlers at the margin of the colonial enterprises supported by the 
metropolis”. Corroborating to that different type of colonization that is likely to have led 

to a different and better institutional arrangement, Rio de Janeiro, a municipality in the 
Southeast  region,  was  the  place  to  where  the  entire  Portuguese  court  flee  during  the 
Napoleonic  expansion  towards  Portugal  in  1808  (Hermann  2007).  The  entire  court 
established itself in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro from 1808 to 1815, bringing with 
them  around  15,000  people  from  the  Portuguese  elite  and  also  several  institutions 
(Venâncio 2007). This fact alone can be considered a positive institutional shock that did 
not happen in any other region of Brazil during its colonial time. Along with that, the 
immigration of other European nationalities to Southeast and South regions flourished 
from the second half of XIX century (Gregory 2007) and many immigrants came to these 
regions as part of the workforce for the coffee farms and settlements. These immigrants 
were mostly artisans, business man, and professors with the intention to settle in Brazil 
and begin a new life, a completely different objective and context when compared to the 
other immigrants that came with the intention to engage in the extractive-related activities 
in the Northeast and North regions. This set of factors is in line with what Acemoglu et 
al. (2001) proposes: having colonizers and immigrants with “more noble” objectives that 
settled in these parts of the Brazilian territory led to better institutional conditions of the 
municipalities of these regions.  

Partially similar to what happened to Southeast and South regions, the Central-
West  region  was  not  under  an  exclusive  extractive  colonization  and  also  had  an 
institutional  shock  similar  to  that  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1808.  The  expansion  of  the 
agricultural and livestock frontiers as a result of actions of the central government to 
modernize  the  Brazilian  agricultural  industry  during  the  1960s,  1970s  and  1980s 
generated  migratory  flows  of  people  from  South  and  Southeast  regions  to  the  so  far 
sparsely inhabited Central-West region. This fact alone was the main responsible for the 
settlements in the part of the country, also a completely different process of what the 
Northeast and North regions were subject in the evolution of their population. Second, 
the transfer of the capital from Rio de Janeiro to Federal District, which is in the hearth 
of Central-West region, in 1960, also brought structural changes for the region as many 
institutions,  organizations,  and  highly  qualified  people  suddenly  moved  to  the  new 
Brazilian capital. Understanding how the Central-West was formed and seeing its current 
level of development, the highest in the country along with Southeast region as showed 
in table 1, encourage us to say that institutional arrangement in the Central-West is better 
than  that  of  the  Northeast  and  North  regions  and  in  line  with  that  of  the  South  and 
Southeast regions.

This study analyzes the relation of devolution and quality of institutions with GDP 
per  capita  growth  from  2005  to  2012  of  4,7421  Brazilian  municipalities.  Brazilian 
municipal elections took place in 2004 and 2008, therefore the period from 2005 to 2012 
reflects exactly two mandates of 4 years of municipal governments. In order to better 
understand this relation, this study created one new measure for devolution. It also applied 
a line of reasoning similar to what Acemoglu et al. (2001) proposes with the intention to 
understand  how  different  regional  institutional  arrangements  relate  to  devolution  and 
economic growth. As far as this research is aware, no study has to date used a similar 
proxy for devolution at municipal level and an argument based on the rational presented 
by Acemoglu et al. (2001) to understand the previously stated relation for the case of 
Brazil. 

The  most  common  measures  in  studies  of  fiscal  decentralization  are  “the 
subnational  share  in  total  government  expenditure  and  the  subnational  share  in  total 
government revenue” (Rodríguez-Pose & Ezcurra 2010, p.623). However, most studies 
are  conducted  at  state  level  due  to  a  better  availability  of  data.  Observing  the 
representative scheme in figure 1, it is possible to observe that, for the case of Brazil, each 
tier of government is responsible for expenditures at municipal level, therefore the sum 
of A, B and C represents the overall expenditure made by all tiers of government in the 
municipal territory. Thus, devolution at municipal level also needs to consider these three 
variables.  For the case of Brazil, there is disaggregated data available on A,  meaning that 
there  is  availability  of  data  on  what  each  municipal  government  spends  or  collects 
(Tesouro Nacional 2016). However, there is no disaggregated data available on B and C, 
meaning that IBGE (2016) and National Treasury (Tesouro Nacional 2015) only releases 
what state and federal government directly spend at municipal level in an aggregated 
manner.  Item  A  consolidates  the  overall  expenditure  of  municipalities,  meaning 
expenditure  of  financial  resources  coming  from  all  tiers  of  government,  but 
operationalized and spent by the municipal public administration at municipal territory. 
Items B and C consolidate the expenditure made by state and federal government directly 
at  municipalities,  bypassing  municipal  administration.  Military  police,  which  is 
operationalized and financed by the state government, but is delivered at the municipal 
level, is an example of expenditure in the B category.

variables restricted the number of observations in this study to 4, 742 municipalities. State capitals, the 
Federal  Disctrict  (Brasilia)  and  Former  federal  regions  (Acre,  Amapá,  Rondônica  e  Roraima)  were 
intentionally dropped from the sample because they represent a specific pattern of municipality that is 
inserted  in  conurbations  and  access  different  sources  of  revenue  (FPM  –  Participation  Fund  of

the level of devolution previously mentioned for Brazilian municipalities. The overall 
level  of  devolution  towards  municipal  governments  is  14%  in  2005,  which  is 
approximately 4 percentage points lower than that of 2012 (18%). Capitals are relevant 
as their absolute expenditures are relevant in absolute terms (much larger municipalities) 
and their devolved fiscal capacity is much higher than the Brazilian average due to a 
larger tax base coming from local resources. Therefore, not having them in the sample 
diminishes the overall level of devolution presented in table 4.

Differences with regards to the devolution levels in regions are in line of what is 
expected: richer regions rely on larger local tax bases such as Service Taxes (ISS) and 
Urban  Property  Taxes  (IPTU),  therefore  are  more  fiscally  devolved.  Considering  the 
differences in GPD per capita and comparing with the devolution level in figures 2 and 
3,  it  is  evident  that  poor  regions  such  as  North  and  Northeast  are,  on  average,  less 
devolved while rich regions such as Southeast, South and Central-West are, on average, 
more devolved.

Because of the lack of data at this level of government, when devolution towards 
municipalities is analyzed, it is widely known that most studies use transfers from central 
to sub-national governments as proxy for devolution.  

In this paper all variables are deflated by the general index price (IPCA, base = 
2013) and considered in per capita terms and in Brazilian currency. Table 5 below shows

Aiming to test the research question and the hypothesis previously presented, an 
econometric model is estimated using panel data, which aims to assess the connection 
between government quality and regional growth and to establish whether the returns of 
Brazilian  Central  Government  financial  devolution  is  affected  by  the  quality  of  the 
government of the regions receiving funds. Also controlled are a series of regional factors 
deemed to affect economic performance. In this model, the growth of GDP per capita 
across  regions  in  Brazilian  municipalities  between  2005  and  2012  is  specified  by  the 
following equation:

The model specification considers a fixed effect (FE) panel regression model, with 
heteroskedasticity robust estimators and municipality (i) and time (t) controls. The sample 
of  4,742  municipalities  in  5  Brazilian  micro  regions.  The  time  period  covered  in  the 
analysis is limited to the years between 2005 and 2012. 

The main interest lies in the coefficients are  𝛽X and 𝛽Y which intend to capture 

relation of devolution and the interaction between devolution and quality of institution 
respectively with economic growth. 

The equation (1) fixed effect estimation must be interpreted with caution, because 
of  the  simultaneity  causality  between  our  outcomes  and  devolution  variables.  As 
identification strategy we are using instrumental variable describe below. 

This paper use the theoretical federal constitutional transfers (or FPM theoretical), 
defined in Section 3, as instrument for devolution. The FPM is around 70% of all central 
government transfer  to municipalities (table2). These transfers are established according 
to the population size of the municipality with thresholds predetermined by law, which 
provides the source of exogenous variation on the treatment status.  

The Federal Constitution of 1988 established the FPM in Art. 159 (Ib), and since 
1993 the share of IR and IPI has been fixed at 22.5 percent. The total transfer amount 
allocation criteria is different for each category of municipality. For inner cities, which 
represents  the  majority  of  municipalities,  the  total  amount  of  municipality  FPM  is 
obtained from the followed function:   

 FPM\,]k= 0.864FPM]q]rs,].
where FPM]q]rs,] is the total revenue (0.225·IR+0.225·IPI) allocated to all Brazilian cities

i in year t, λs is a distinct coefficient for each Brazilian state k, and λi is the municipality 
coefficient derived from the population thresholds. Smaller municipalities in terms of 
population  size  correspond  to  lower  coefficients.  This  mechanism  allows  different 
municipalities sharing equal population size to receive the same FPM amount only if they 
belong to the same state. The figure 5 below show the correlation between the average 
actual and theoretical municipalities FPM from 2005 and 2012, the R2=0.63. 

Indeed, since 1991 around 1080 new municipalities have been created in Brazil. 
Once, the municipalities that was divided receives a FPM proportionally larger than its 
population loss it makes the FPM proposed constitutionally differ from the one actually 
received  by  the  municipalities.  In  addition,  it  is  possible  to  identify  a  flaw  in  TCU's 
oversight, allowing some municipalities to receive more than constitutionally provided. 
Thus, since there is a difference between the FPM actual (or transfer) and the regulated 
theoretical transfer, we use the latter as instruments on the actual constitutional transfers. 
 

Results and Discussion 
 
According  to  the  theories  of  Acemoglu  et  al.  (2001)  that  different  types  of 
colonization lead to different institutional arrangements and that these differences persist 
overtime, this study suggests that the geographical regions of Brazil differ with regards 
to their institutional arrangements, therefore with regards to capacity to reap the benefits 
of any devolutionary policy. These regions and their differences can be clustered into two 
main  groups  according  to  table  3  where  there  is  the  Southern  part  of  the  country, 
comprised of Central-West, Southeast and South, with institutions that are classified as 
good,  and  the  Northern  part  of  the  country,  comprised  of  North  and  Northeast,  with 
institutions that are classified as bad. Based on this definition we had used as a proxy for 

(2) 

 

quality of institution an dummy variable equal 1 if municipalities belong to region with 
good  institution:  Central  West,  South  and  Southeast  and  zero  for  municipalities  that 
belong to other three regions. 

The  aim  of  this  model  is  establish  the  link  between  devolution  and  quality  of 
institution with economic growth. In order to better explain devolution in a continental 
country with a diverse institutional context, it is crucial to disaggregate the analysis into 
a regional level. According to the theories of Acemoglu et al. (2001) that different types 
of  colonization  lead  to  different  institutional  arrangements  and  that  these  differences 
persist overtime, this study suggests that the geographical regions of Brazil differ with 
regards to their institutional arrangements, therefore with regards to capacity to reap the 
benefits of any devolutionary policy. These regions and their differences can be clustered 
into two main groups according to table 3 where there is the Southern part of the country, 
comprised of Central-West, Southeast and South, with institutions that are classified as 
good,  and  the  Northern  part  of  the  country,  comprised  of  North  and  Northeast,  with 
institutions that are classified as bad. With this panorama presented, table 6 shows the 
regional  relation  of  devolution  and  quality  of  institutions  with  economic  growth  of 
municipalities.  

Table 6 below report both strategy of estimation FE and FE-IV. As expected the 
FE-IV devolution coefficient is bigger then FE regression model (table 6, columns (1) 
and (4)), suggesting that endogeneity problem was controlled. The FE analysis provides 
evidence that financial devolution from central government to Brazilian municipalities 
and institution proxy (south) have had a positive and statistically significant link with 
regional growth, (table 6 columns (1), (2) and (3)). The Both coefficients are positive and 
significant, except in regression with interaction. The interaction between devolution and 
institutional  quality  is  positive  and  significant,  pointing  that  in  regions  with  better 
institutional arrangements the municipalities have better economic growth. Rodríguez-
Pose and Garcilazo, 2015 have found similar results for Europian Union.  

Estimation results using IV strategy are reported in table 6, columns (4), (5), (6) 
and (7). After inclusion institutional quality proxies in our model, table 6, columns 5 and 
6 financial devolution coefficients lose importance to explain GDP per capita growth. 
These results suggested that institution is the more important to explain economic growth 
than  financial  devolution.  Indeed,  leave  in  regions  with  better  institutional  condition 
(south) increase the GDP per capita growth in 4% on average. 

Exploring  those  results,  we  estimate  the  equation  1  interacting  financial 
devolution  with  each  regional  dummies  instead  of  the  South  dummy,  respectively: 
North(N), Northeast(NE), Center-West(CW), Southeast(SE) and South(S). The results 
show that the coefficients for all three South regions are positive and significant. Indeed, 
increase financial devolution in CW, S and SE regions raise the municipalities economic 
growth  in  respectively  0.17%,  0.2  and  0.22%.  These  results  indicate  that  better 
institutional  arrangement  of  these  region  with  devolution  allowed  the  municipalities 
located at the Southern part of Brazil to become more efficient, a fact that is likely to be 
converted into economic growth. On the other hand, The North and Northeast region did 
not present a significant coefficient, therefore, in this econometric model, devolution does 
not show relation with economic development of municipalities in those region. This 
might  indicate  that  the  bad  institutional  arrangement  in  that  region  does  not  allow 
municipal  governments  to  increase  their  efficiency.  For  instance,  the  average 
qualification of public servants at the North and Northeast regions in the year of 2005 
was lower than the country’s average (IBGE 2005) and this can be an indicative of limited 
capacity  to  transform  the  autonomy  and  fiscal  capacity  into  more  allocative  and 
productive efficiency.

Concluions 

 
This paper has investigated the relation of devolution and quality of institutions at 
with GDP per capita growth of Brazilian municipalities from 2005 to 2012 and its main 
hypothesis was that devolution and good quality of institutions together at municipal level 
are positively correlated with GDP per capita growth. The analysis using an innovative 
proxy for devolution and the argument that the historical evolution of Brazilian regions 
influenced the formation of institutional arrangements of municipalities confirmed our 
hypothesis by showing that devolution is related to economic growth and that this relation 
is  particularly  stronger  where  the  institutional  conditions  are  better.  To  control  for 
endogeneity  of  our  interest  variable  we  have  used  the  FPM  theoretical  divided  by 
expenditure as a instrument for devolution in IV2SLS regression. 

When analyzed in an aggregate manner for the entire country, devolution of fiscal 
capacity  is  strongest  and  significant  variable.  However,  when  analyzing  devolution 
disaggregated  into  regions,  the  coefficient  for  the  devolution  of  the  regions  become 
significant again just in South region in line with what was hypothesized in this research: 
for regions with good quality of institutions such as South, devolution has a positive and 
significant relation with economic growth. The coefficient for other regions were not 

significant, indicating that the worse institutional arrangement of municipalities might 
have diminished their capacity to become more efficient through devolution.  

Devolution  is  in  the  agenda  of  the  political  discussions  happening  in  Brazil 
nowadays. This research might inform these discussions by indicating that devolution, 
for  the  case  of  Brazilian  municipalities,  is  positively  related  to  economic  growth. 
However,  two  other  factors  are  very  important  to  be  considered  when  engaging  in  a 
devolutionary process. First, it is important to have a balance between devolution through 
transferring financial resources and devolution through transferring capacity to collect 
taxes  locally.  The  latter  might  induce  local  governments  to  be  more  efficient  and 
accountable as they need to make efforts locally to collect part of their financial resources, 
indeed the better collected tax structure is found in the south region. Second, the quality 
of  institutions  of  municipalities  is  important  when  devolving  fiscal  capacity.  So, 
initiatives to improve quality local institutions are welcome and can bring positive effects 
when fiscal capacity is devolved. This research suggests that further studies be conducted 
using  a  more  elaborated  analysis  and  more  disaggregated  proxies  for  quality  of 
institutions at municipal level in order to confirm this research’s findings.
