Abstract: Characterized by a lower level of economic development than the U.S., the Brazilian labor force 
has  lower  levels  of  education,  wages,  and  occupational  skill.  While  both  countries  have  high  levels  of 
inequality,  low  economic  development  in  Brazil  reduces  the  proportion  of  total  income  that  accrues  to  the 
bottom  two  quintiles  of  the  income  distribution.  In  recent  decades,  inequality  has  declined  in  Brazil  by 
increasing income cash transfer programs while reducing the proportion of the labor force employed in the 
lowest  skilled  occupations.  However,  this  trend  has  been  somewhat  offset  by  the  concurrent  increase  in 
professional and other upper white-collar occupations. By contrast, in the U.S., where cash transfer programs 
have not  increased, inequality  rose over this time period largely due to  higher  earnings accruing to  the top 
decile  of  households.  This  rise  in  inequality  in  the  U.S.  appears  to  be  less  immediately  associated  with 
occupational structure in general but somewhat more immediately connected with rising earnings and earnings 
inequality  among  high  skill  professionals.  Our  analysis  thus  suggests  that  occupational  structure  has  more 
general  effects  on  income  inequality  at  a  lower  level  of  economic  development.    At  a  higher  level  of 
development, inequality seems to increase in large part due to rising inequality among high skill employees 
which may be more related to unobserved variables within occupations.

Resumo: Caracterizada por um baixo nível de desenvolvimento econômico em comparação aos EUA, a força 
de trabalho brasileira possui baixos níveis de educação, salários e habilidades ocupacionais. Embora os dois 
países apresentem altos níveis de desigualdade, o baixo desenvolvimento econômico no Brasil seria um dos 
responsáveis pela baixa proporção do rendimento total acumulado pelos dois últimos quintos da distribuição 
de  renda.  Nas  últimas  décadas,  a  desigualdade  diminuiu  no  Brasil,  tanto  pela  expansão  dos  programas  de 
transferência de renda, quanto pela redução da proporção da força de trabalho empregada em ocupações de 
baixa  qualificação.  Por  outro  lado,  nos  EUA,  onde  não  houve  mudanças  substanciais  nos  programas  de 
transferência de renda, a desigualdade aumentou  sobretudo  devido  ao expressivo crescimento  da renda das 
famílias dos décimos superiores da distribuição de renda. Este crescrimento da desigualdade nos EUA parece 
menos associado à composição da estrutura ocupacional, mas ao crescimento da desigualdade dentro do grupo 
de profissionais mais qualificados. As análises sugerem, assim, que mudanças na estrutura ocupacional teria 
efeitos  mais imediatos na desigualdade de  renda  em  um  nível inferior de desenvolvimento econômico. Em 
estágios  mais elevados,  a desigualdade parece aumentar, em  grande parte, devido  à crescente desigualdade 
entre  os  profissionais  altamente  qualificados,  que  estaria  relacionada  a  fatores  não  observáveis  dentro  das 
ocupações.

Introduction  

Occupations are central to the stratification systems of industrial countries, but they have played little 
role in empirical attempts to explain the well-documented dynamics of income inequality. The occupational 
structure reflects the organization of the production and the level of technological development, and will affects 
the demand for different types of products and services, as well as the demand and supply for different types 
of labor (Blau & Duncan, 1967; Banerjee & Newman, 1993). Occupations also tend to define in a large extent 
the  current  and  future  perspective  of  income  generation,  playing  a  central  role  to  explain  social  relations, 
economic opportunities and inequalities between individuals in modern societies (Goldthorpe, 2000; Rose & 
Harrison, 2007).  

Brazil  and  the  U.S.  provide  an  interesting  comparison  to  understand  the  impacts  of  occupational 
structure on socioeconomic inequalities. They are the two biggest economies and populations of America and 
shared important peculiarities in their process of socioeconomic development. These countries were colonized 
almost  simultaneously,  based  initially  in  the  agricultural  production  in  big  farmers  with  slave  labor,  and 
witnessed  singular  trajectories  of  social,  economic  and  institutional  development  (Acemoglu  &  Robinson, 
2012;  Furtado,  1986).  Nowadays,  they  present  high  levels  of  socioeconomic  inequality  and  also  huge 
differences in their levels of socioeconomic development.  

Differences in the structure of their labor markets would explain in large extent their current levels of 
socioeconomic  development  and  inequalities.  Labor  productivity  in  substantially  lower  in  Brazil  for  all 
economic activities, determining levels of labor remuneration substantially lower in comparison with the U.S., 
as well as the low participation of skilled labors in its occupational structure (Maia & Menezes, 2014). The 
oversupply of unskilled workers and the few opportunities of social mobility have determined an occupational 
structure  with  high  levels  of  segmentation  and  inequality  (Ulyssea,  2006).  Nowadays,  the  concentration  of 
unskilled occupations in the Brazilian labor structure and its extreme pay differences in relation to the small 
number of skilled occupations contribute in large extent to explain the high levels of inequality in the labor 
market (Maia, 2013).  

Economic  growth,  that  would  be  essential  to  generate  new  opportunities  of  employment  and  social 
mobility  (Piketty,  2014),  have  not  been  able  to  improve  consistently  the  process  of  social  mobility  in  this 
country, which is still characterized by high levels of inequality of opportunities (Bourguignon, et al., 2007; 
Ribeiro,  2012).  Despite  some  recent  improvements,  the  quality  of  education,  which  plays  a  central  role 
improving human and social capital, is still very low in Brazil and would help to explain the low development 
of its  occupational  structure  as well,  as the restrict process  of social mobility  (Ferreira, et  al.,  2011). Huge 
differences  in  the  level  of  regional  development  have  also  been  pointed  as  an  important  determinant  of 
socioeconomic inequalities in Brazil (Neto, 1997), as well as the extreme conditions of life and access to basic 
infrastructure that some social groups are submitted to (Pinheiro, et al., 2009).  

In turn, the American occupational structure would reflect an economy more specialized in services of 
high productivity.  Influenced by the emergence of new information  and communications technologies, this 
country witnessed in the last decades a substantial rise of managerial and professional occupations, over the 
reduction of agricultural and manufacturing jobs, characterizing the so called informational society (Aoyama 
& Castells, 2002). Earning inequalities is also high, but mainly characterized by intra-occupational differences, 
suggesting a lower level of occupational segmentation in their labor market (Kim & Sakamoto, 2008). 

Nonetheless, the U.S. recently observed a substantial increase in the demand for high skills jobs and in 
the earnings differentials between those workers with and without college diploma. Acemoglu & Autor (2010) 
suggest that the returns to skills (and to education) is determined by a race between the increase in the demand 
for skills in the labor market and the supply of qualified workers, notably workers with college diploma. Since 
the  demand  grew  faster  than  supply  in  some  especific  high  skilled  occupations,  earnings  grew  faster  for 
qualified workers, as well as the inequality between the groups of educational attainment. Autor et al. (2003) 
also  highlight  a  process  of  polarization  in  the  American  occupational  structure,  this  means,  reduction  of 
medium skill occupations and increase of top and bottom occupational groups. Medium occupational groups 
are characterized by routine tasks that can be easily substituted by machines following explicit programmed 

2 

rules. In turn, top and bottom occupations are characterized by tasks that demand problem solving, judgment, 
and creativity in the former, and flexibility and physical adaptability in the latter. Activities that can not be 
easily specified as a series of instructions and much less susceptible to an automation process.  

Overall, there are several aspects of social inequality in Brazil and in the U.S. that are strictly related 
to the structure of their labor market. This study highlights how the process of economic development and 
changes in the occupational structure contribute to explain the levels of income and earnings inequality. More 
specifically, it explores the dynamics of inequality between 1983 and 2013, highlighting: i) how low level of 
economic  development  and  the  concentration  of  bottom  low  skilled  occupations  in  Brazil  reduces  the 
proportion of total income that accrues to the bottom  deciles of the income distribution; ii) how the rise of 
wages within the most qualified professional occupations in the U.S. have contributed to increase inequality. 
Finally, the study discusses the effects of the occupational structure on income inequality at different levels of 
economic development. 

 

Material and methods 
 
Data base 

Analyses  are  based  on  pooled  annual  data  from  the  Brazilian  Pesquisa  Nacional  por  Amostra  de 
Domicílios  (PNAD),  sponsored  by  the  IBGE  (Instituto  Brasileiro  de  Geografia  e  Estatística),  and  the 
American Current Population Survey (CPS), sponsored jointly by the U.S. BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) 
and the U.S. Census Bureau. The period of analyses comprehend the years between 1983 and 2013. PNAD is 
a household sample collected annually1 and is nationally representative of Brazilian territory (with the slight 
exception  of  a  few  remote  rural  areas  in  six  northern  states  which  represented  less  than  3%  of  Brazilian 
population in 2000 [IBGE 1995])2. In turn, CPS is a household sample survey applied monthly in  the U.S. 
(BLS 2000) and we used data of its Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC).  

Monetary values in PNAD refers to self-reported monthly values usually received in the reference year. 
Self-reported  annual  income  and  earnings  in  CPS  were  divided  by  12  to  be  comparable  with  the  Brazilian 
monthly values. Nominal values were deflated to July 2013 using the INPC (Índice Nacional de Preços ao 
Consumidor) in Brazil and the CPI (Consumer Price Index) in the U.S.. Subsequently, Brazilian earnings were 
converted to International PPP (Purchasing Parity Power) dollars using the exchange rate available at World 
Data Bank3. PPP are both currency converters and spatial price deflators that equalize the purchasing power 
of different currencies in the process of conversion (International Comparison Programa, 2011).  

In both countries, top values were censored at the 1% level in order to consider methodological changes 
implement in the methodology of top-coding applied by the CPS4. In other words, values exceeding the top-
code  threshold  (99-th  percentile)  were  simply  recoded  with  the  threshold.  This  procedure  were  implement 
independently to individual earnings and household per capita income. This technique prizes by the simplicity 
and robustness to changes implemented in the top-code methodology, without further assumptions about the 
probability distribution of the income variables5. 

                                                 
1 Between 1983 and 2011, PNAD was not applied in the years 1991, 1994, 2000, and 2010.  
2 PNAD excludes the rural areas of the states of Rondônia, Acre, Amazonas, Roraima, Pará and Amapá. Since 2004, these areas 
have been added to the PNAD sampling frame, but for our purposes of maintaining historical comparibility, those areas were not 
considered in this study.  
3 In July 1st 2013, the exchange rate was 1.81 Brazilian Reais for each 1 PPP international dollar (World Bank, 2015). 
4 Between 1962 and 1995, the values exceeding the top-code threshold in CPS were simply recoded with the threshold. Between 
1996 and 2010, the Census Bureau introduced replacement values to take the place of top-coded values, depending on characteristics 
such as race, gender, and full time status. Since 2011, all incomes above the top-code are rounded to two significant digits and then 
exchanged among individuals within a bounded interval (Minnesota Population Center, 2015). 
5 See, for example, Piketty & Saez, 2003).

We considered as employed those who were 16 years or older and, during the reference week (a) did 
any work at all (for at least 1 hour) as a paid employee; worked in his own businesses, profession, or on his 
own farm; or (b)  were not  working, but  who had a job  or business from which he was temporarily  absent. 
Persons whose job was Armed Forces and those with non-positive earnings were not considered in both the 
surveys.  
 
Occupational Structure 

We developed a typology of occupational stratification to analyze the levels of earnings inequality in 
the Brazilian and American labor markets. Occupation codes provided by PNAD and CPS were classified into 
common  occupational  groups  in  Brazil  and  in  the  U.S.  The  classification  was  based  on  skills,  education, 
training, credentials and also social prestige or power. Since these concepts are very similar to those used by 
the  Brazilian  CBO  (Classificação  Brasileira  de  Ocupações)  and  the  American  OCS  (Occupational 
Classification System), the groups reflect mainly the structure proposed by these systems (BLS, 2000; CBO, 
2010). As a result, occupational codes of PNAD and CPS were initially aggregated into 20 occupational groups 
(see Table 1). According to  the analytical  convenience, these 20  two-digit occupational  groups can also  be 
aggregated into 6 one-digit occupational groups: 1) Managers; 2) Professionals; 3) Specialists; 4) Sales and 
Laborers; 5) Low Services; 6) Farming.

The  hierarchy  of  the  occupational  groups  were  mainly  based  on  the  level  of  skills,  qualification, 
earnings and also social and political power to control the capital or the labor. For example, managers do not 
have necessary higher levels of education than  professionals, but they tend to possess the power to control 

4 

large number of employees in public and private companies. Professionals are highly skilled workers, usually 
with superior diploma, who also tend to receive high earnings. Specialists are workers with intermediate levels 
of  education  and  earnings,  although  many  positions  require  a  superior  or  a  technical  diploma.  Sales  and 
laborers present low level of education and earnings, usually with no more than secondary education. They 
are  one  step  above  the  low  services  workers,  the  non-agricultural  occupations  with  the  lowest  levels  of 
qualification and remuneration. Finally, faming workers perform manual and low-paid activities in agriculture, 
fishing or forestry.  

 

Decomposing the variation in the per capita income inequality 

We first used the Gini index to analyze inequality in the distribution of per capita income. Gini index 
(0  G < 1) is based on a concentration curve (Lorenz curve), representing the relation between the accumulated 
concentration  of  the  population  (X-axis)  and  the  accumulated  concentration  of  income  (Y-axis).  The  area 
between the Lorenz curve and the X-axis is represented by 𝛽, and is reference to compute the Gini index: 

𝐺 = 1 − 2𝛽  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

Since the per capita income can be composed by different sources, we can also decompose the Gini 
index to consider the contribution of each source to total inequality. For this specific purpose, the Gini index 
can be represented by the weighted sum of concentration ratios (𝐶𝑠) observed for each source of income  f. 
More specifically (Hoffmann, 2006): 

𝐺 = ∑

𝑘
𝑠=1

𝑝𝑠𝐶𝑠

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (2) 

Where 𝑝𝑠 is the total share of the s-th source of income, and 𝐶𝑠 is its respective concentration ratio, 

which can be given by: 

𝐶𝑠 = 1 − 2𝛽𝑠   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(3) 

Similarly to the Gini index, the concentration ratio (1<𝐶𝑠<1) is based on a specific concentration curve 
for  each  source  of  income.  The  difference  is  that  the  accumulated  concentration  of  income  (Y-axis)  now 
represents the accumulated concentration of the s-th source of income, holding the same hierarchy of the per 
capita incomes. Thus, 𝛽𝑠 represents the area between the s-th concentration curve and the X-axis.  

Using expression (3) we can evaluate, for example, in what extent total inequality is due to income 
from labor and other sources. We can also represent the variation in the Gini index between two periods (∆𝐺) 
as a function of: i) changes in the composition of the sources of income; ii) changes in the concentration ratios 
of the sources of income. Making some algebraic transformations, the variation in the Gini index will be given 
by (Hoffmann, 2006): 

∆𝐺 = ∑

𝑘
𝑠=1

[(𝐶𝑠̅ − 𝐺̅)∆𝑝𝑠
⏟        
𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

+ 𝑝̅𝑠∆𝐶𝑠⏟  

]
 

𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦

 

 

 

 

 

(4) 

Where 𝐶̅𝑠, 𝐺̅ e 𝑝̅𝑠 represent the average values for the respective measures in the two periods. The first 
term represent the composition effect, this means, the share of the variation in the Gini index that is due to 
changes in the proportion of income accumulated by each source. The second term represent the  inequality 
effect, this means, the share of the variation that is due to changes in the concentration ratio of each source of 
income.  
 

Decomposing the variation in the individual earnings inequality 

Specific analyses for individual earnings inequality in the labor market were done using Theil indicator. 
Suppose Yi the i-th individual earnings and Y the total earnings in a population of size n. Theil (0  T  ln n) 
will be given by (Hoffmann, 1998): 

5 

𝑇 = ∑ 𝑌𝑖
𝑌

𝑛
𝑖=1

ln 𝑛

𝑌𝑖
𝑌

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(6) 

Both Theil and Gini index satisfy the Pigou-Dalton condition, this means, they will increase in value 
for regressive transfers of income. In addition, Theil is relatively insensitive to changes occurred in the bottom, 
middle  or  upper  bound  of  the  income  distribution  (Hoffmann,  1992).  Gini  is  relatively  more  sensitive  to 
changes in intervals with higher density of frequency, usually in the middle of the income distribution.  

A  main  advantage  of  the  Theil  indicator  is  that  it  can  be  linearly  decomposed  into  two  main 
components: i) differences between groups; ii) differences within groups. Suppose, for example, an employed 
population divided into g occupational groups. The total earnings inequality can be represented by the sum of 
the inequality due to earnings differences between the occupational groups (B) and earnings differences within 
the occupational groups (W). B and W will be given by (Hoffmann, 1998): 

𝐵 = ∑

𝑇 = 𝐵 + 𝑊 
𝑌𝑗

𝑝𝑗 𝐵𝑗

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(7) 

(8) 

(9) 

Where 𝑌𝑗 is the total earnings accumulated by the j-th occupational group, 𝑝𝑗 is the respective share of 
the  total  earnings,  𝑛𝑗  is  the  respective  population,  and  𝐵𝑗  is  the  between  inequality  component  for  the  j-th 
occupational  group.  𝑊𝑗  is  the  inequality  within  the  j-th  occupational  group  and  is  computed  similarly  to 
expression (6), restricting analysis to the population of the j-th occupational group.  

We can also  evaluate in what  extent variation in the Theil indicator in  a period (∆𝑇) was due to: i) 
changes in the differences between the groups of analysis (∆𝐵); ii) changes in the differences within the groups 
(∆𝑊). More specifically, we will have: 

𝑇 = ∆𝐵 + ∆𝑊  

 

 

∆𝑇 = ∑

⏟      

]

 

𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(10) 

 

(11) 

The  first  term  in  expression  (11)  represents  the  share  of  the  variation  in  the  Theil  indicator  due  to 
changes  in  the  between  component  of  the  j-th  group.  Groups  can  contribute  to  modify  between  inequality 
through  changes  in  their  participation  in  the  occupational  structure  (∆𝑝𝑗)  or  changes  in  their  relative 
accumulation  of  earnings  (∆𝐵𝑗).  The  second  term  represents  the  contribution  of  changes  in  the  within 
component  of  the  j-th  group.  Similarly,  groups  can  modify  within  inequality  through  changes  in  their 
participation (∆𝑝𝑗) or changes in the patterns of inequality within these group (∆𝑊𝑗). 

Expressions  (8)  through  (9)  can  also  be  developed  to  consider  additional  levels  of  disaggregation. 
Suppose, for example, that, in addition to g occupational groups, population is also divided into d groups of 
education. B and W indicators of inequality for two levels of disaggregation can be given by: 

𝐵2 = ∑
𝑊2 = ∑

𝑔
𝑗=1
𝑔
𝑗=1

𝑑
∑ 𝑝𝑗𝑙 𝐵𝑗𝑙
 
𝑙=1
𝑑
∑ 𝑝𝑗𝑙𝑊𝑗𝑙
𝑙=1

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(12) 

(13) 

Now B2 represents the share of total inequality due to the differences between all the combinations of 
the two groups of analysis, occupations and education, as well as W2 represents the share due to the differences 
within these combinations of groups. The higher the value of B2, the higher the explanatory power of these 
groups of analysis over the total accumulation of income.  

The marginal contribution of a variable represents the share of the total between inequality that can 
only be explained by its respective group of categories. It can be easily computed comparing two measures of 
between inequality: i) considering all groups of analysis (unrestricted B); ii) excluding the groups of interest 
(restricted B). For example, the marginal contribution of the d categories of education (𝐵𝑑) will be given by: 

6

(14) 

Equations (12) to (14) can also be easily extended to consider k levels of analysis. In this study, 6 levels 
of  analysis  are  considered:  i)  occupation  (20  two-digit  occupational  groups);  ii)  education  (no  diploma,  no 
more than elementary diploma; no more than secondary diploma; college diploma or more); iii) age (16-19; 
20-29; 30-39; 40-49; 50;59; 60 or more); iv) gender (male and female); v) race (white, black and others); and 
vi) region (in Brazil: North, Northeast, Southeast, South and Midwest; in the US: West, Northeast, Southeast, 
Southwest, Midwest).  

 

The contribution of labor income to total inequality 
Brazil  and  the  U.S.  were  jointly  responsible  for  more  than  500  million  people  living  in  the  same 
 
America in 2013 (Table 2), which were submitted to extreme levels of socioeconomic inequality. Changes in 
the socioeconomic structure in  the last 30  years  were more pronounced in Brazil. For example, population 
grew 60% in Brazil between 1983 and 2013, and just 36% in the U.S.. As remarkable as the population growth 
in Brazil was the sharp reduction in its number of member per household (31%, from 4.4 in 1983 to 3.1 in 
2013), mainly children under 16, a main consequence of the fast decline in the fertility rate in the 80s and 90s 
(Maia  &  Sakamoto,  2014)6.  As  a  result  of  both  demographic  changes  and  economic  dynamics,  per  capita 
income grew  faster  and  unusually in  Brazil, reducing the huge differences in  relation  to  the U.S..  In 2013, 
Brazil had 197 million of people living with a per capita income of 561 dollars per month, 60% higher than in 
1992 (274 dollars per month), but still 4.1 times lower than in the U.S. (2,279 dollars per month).

6 Between 1983 and 2012, fertility rate dropped from 3.7 to 1.8 births per woman in Brazil. In the U.S., a tenuous increase, from 1.8 
to 1.9.

In addition to huge differences between the average incomes, the gap between the levels of inequality 
within  these  countries  is  also  substantial.  Although  both  countries  are  characterized  by  singular  levels  of 
inequality, they are particularly high in Brazil. In this country, the share of the total income accumulated by 
the 40% poorest are comparable to the share accumulated by the 1% richest, even considering the censoring 
at  the  per  capita  income  of  the  1%  richest,  which  tend  naturally  to  underestimate  real  inequality.  When 
considering the income accumulated by the 10% richest (the sum of the 1% censored highest values and the 
income of the next 9% richest), it was 3.3 times higher than the share accumulated by the Brazilian 40% poorest 
in 2013. Differences are less extreme in the U.S., where the ratio between the share of income accumulated by 
the 10% richest and the 40% poorest was 2.5 in 2013 and the Gini index was 5 percentage points lower than 
in Brazil.  

A main responsible for the higher levels of inequality in Brazil is the extreme concentration of people 
in the lower bound of the income distribution. Even the 50% middle group of the income distribution in Brazil 
presents very low levels of per capita incomes in comparison to their American counterparts, and, thus, they 
do not accumulate a substantial share of the total income (50% in Brazil and 56% in the U.S. in 2013). As a 
result,  differences  between  the  lowest  and  middle  percentiles  in  Brazil  and  in  the  U.S.  are  higher  than 
differences between the highest percentiles. For example, in 2013 the percentile 40 in the U.S. was 4.6 times 
higher than in Brazil, meanwhile the percentile 90 was 4.0 times higher and the percentile 99 was just 2.9 times 
higher. The scenario in 1983 was more dramatic, when the percentile 40 in the U.S. was 10.5 times higher than 
in Brazil and the percentile 90 was 5.4 higher.  
The reduction in the levels of differences between Brazil and the U.S. is  a result of opposite trends 
 
witnessed  in  the  dynamics  of  inequality  in  this  period  (Figure  1).  Inequality  reduced  sharply  in  Brazil, 
especially in the 2000s. For example, Gini index fell 9 percentage points between 2001 and 2013, and the ratio 
between the share of the total income accumulated by the 10% richest and the 40% poorest reduced from 5.5 
to  4.0.  Meanwhile,  in  a  continuous  growth  of  the  income  inequality  in  the  U.S.,  Gini  index  increased  5 
percentage points between 1983 and 2013, and the ratio between the share of the total income accumulated by 
the 10% richest and the 40% poorest increased from 3.0 to 3.5.

These divergent trends reproduces, in large extent, particular dynamics of labor incomes observed in 
each country. Figure 2 presents the accumulated variation in the per capita income (index, 1983=100) of the 
10% richest and the 40% poorest, disaggregated into two main sources of income: labor and others (pension, 
investments,  rents,  social  benefits,  cash transfer  programs,  among others). The trends highlights  how labor 
income grew faster for the poorest  in  Brazil and faster for the richest  in  the U.S.. Between 1983  and 2013 
average per capita income from labor (labor income) more than doubled for the 40% poorest (grew 107%) and

grew just 67% for the 10% richest in Brazil. Divergent trends were witnessed in the U.S., where labor income 
grew 69% for the 10% richest and remained mostly unchanged for the 40% poorest (grew just 9%).

The accumulated variation in the average income from other sources of the 40% poorest in Brazil is 
represented by a secondary vertical axis (in red), in order to stress its singular dynamics. Between 1983 and 
2013, this source of income grew almost 9 times. This growth is strictly related to the expansion of cash transfer 
programs  (mainly  Bolsa  Família)  and  other  important  social  benefits  (such  as  rural  pension  and  BPC  - 
Benefício  de  Prestação  Continuada,  a  benefit  for  elderly  and  other  vulnerable  groups  with  low  per  capita 
income), which clearly contributed to increase the average value in the bottom of the income distribution and 
to reduce income inequality in Brazil (see, for example, Hoffmann, 2010; Maia, 2010).  

In the U.S., the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 affected specially the labor income of the poorest, 
many  of  those  whom  lost  their  jobs,  and  the  other  sources  of  income  of  the  richest,  such  as  interests  and 
dividends. Between 2007 and 2013 per capita income from other sources (other income) of the 10% richest 
fell 13% and the labor income of the 40% poorest fell 15%7. Other sources of the richest were also especially 
affected by the dot-com crisis in the 2000s, falling 37% between 2000 and 2003.  

In  2000,  benefited  by  a  singular  period  of  economic  growth  in  the  developing  economies,  Brazil 
witnessed a substantial growth of its labor income for both the richest and, especially, the poorest. In the whole 
period, the accumulated growth in the labor income of the 40% poorest was 40 percentage points higher that 
of the 10% richest (107% against 67% between 1983 and 2013). Minimum wage played an important role in 
this dynamics, almost doubling in this period (variation of 74% between 1983 and 2013), pushing the growth 
of the labor income of those in the lower bound of the income distribution (Saboia, 2010). 

Labor income represents the highest share of the total household income and plays a fundamental role 
in the dynamics of the overall income inequality. Despite the fact that, driven by increasing social benefits, the 
share of other sources in the total income grew substantially among the poorest and middle segments in Brazil, 
labor remains as the predominant source of income for all groups of income (Row %, in Table 3). In 2013, 
labor income represented 77% of the total household income in Brazil (89% in 1983). Among the poorest, its 
contribution fell 19 percentage points, from 92% in 1983 to 73% in 2013. In turn, labor participation grew 
slightly in the U.S., from 79% in 1983 to 80% in 2013, pushed by the substantial gains of the 10% richest. In 
fact, the share of labor income increased just for the 10% richest, decreasing tenuously among the middle and 
bottom groups.  
 

                                                 
7 Between 2007 and 2013, the highest falls among the other sources of the 10% richest were observed for interest (46%) and dividends 
(19%).

The distribution of labor and other sources of income among the groups of per capita income (Column 
 
% in Table 3) allows us to analyze the contribution of each source to overall income inequality. For example, 
if the accumulation of labor income among the richest is higher than that of other sources, means that labor 
income contributes to increase overall inequality. This was actually what happened in both countries in 2013, 
this  means,  labor  income  was  more  accumulated  among  the  richest  and  contributed  to  increase  overall 
inequality in Brazil and in the U.S. The 10% richest accumulated 39% of the total labor income in Brazil (35% 
of other sources) and 33% in the U.S. (25% of the other sources).  

Other sources are more concentrated among the poorest because social benefits and pensions tend to 
prevail  in  self-reports  of  income  from  other  sources  in  both  countries8.  Naturally,  a  more  precise  analysis 
would allow us to identify how the different sources of non-labor income contribute to increase or decrease 
inequality, since the distribution of rents and dividends tend be substantially different than social benefits, as 
well as their under-reports in the household surveys.  
The Gini concentration ratio (C, equation 2) gives the specific concentration of each source of income, 
 
measuring in what extent labor income is more concentrated than other sources: 7 percentage points in Brazil 
(51.6 against 45.0 from other sources in 2013) and 17 percentage points in the U.S. (50.6 against 33.4). It is 
also remarkable the substantial reduction in the concentration of other sources in Brazil, 19 percentage points 
(from 64.5 in 1983 to 45.0 in 2013).  
 
Based on the changes in the composition of the sources of income and in their respective concentrations 
ratios, the variation in the total Gini index can now be decomposed into two main sources (equation 4): 1) 
composition effect, variation due to changes in the composition of the sources of income; 2) inequality effect, 
variation due to changes in the concentration ratio of each source of income. The most substantial contribution 

                                                 
8 In the U.S., social benefits (such as unemployment compensation, worker’s compensation, social security payments, supplemental 
security, public assistance or welfare, veteran’s benefit, survivor’s income and disability) represented 68% of the other sources of 
income  in  2011,  and pensions  (retirement  income)  more  14%.  In  Brazil,  where  there  is  no  clear  distinction  for  some  sources  of 
incomes in the household surveys (such as cash transfer programs, rural pensions and BPC), income from all types of pensions and 
donations (mostly social benefits) represented close to 86% of the other sources of income in 2013. 

10 

to the total variation in the Gini index between 1983 and 2013, in both countries, was due to changes in the 
concentration ratio (inequality effect), especially in the concentration of the labor income (Table 4). In Brazil, 
the reduction in the concentration ratio of labor income contributed with 3.31 percentage points to reduce total 
inequality  (52%  of  the  total  reduction  of  6.47  percentage  points  in  the  Gini  index).  In  the  U.S.,  the  rising 
concentration ratio of labor income contributed with 4.4 percentage points to increase inequality (88.5% of the 
total growth of 4.98 percentage points).

Other sources of income also played an important role reducing inequality, especially in Brazil. The 
rising share of other sources of income accumulated by the poorest (inequality effect) contributed with 3.31 
percentage points (51%) to reduce inequality in Brazil. The overall impact of other sources was slightly lower 
(48%), due to the positive contribution of their composition effect (3%). Despite this remarkable dynamics of 
other sources, labor income remained as the main source of income inequality and has been responsible for 
the main changes in the dynamics of inequality in both countries. Now, it is important to understand what are 
the sources of changes in the labor income and how social groups were affect by them.  
 

Occupational structure and earning inequality 
 
Occupational structure can be highlighted as one of the main factors explaining differences of income 
between Brazil and the U.S., as well as the patterns of inequality that social groups are submitted to within 
these  countries.  The  occupational  structure  in  the  U.S.  reflect  a  more  developed  economy,  intensive  in  the 
demand of skilled occupations, such as professional and specialists (Figure 3). These two groups represented 
44%  of  the  occupations  in  the  U.S.  in  2013,  while  in  Brazil  they  were  just  27%.  The  low  prevalence  of 
occupations characteristic of middle income groups in Brazil tend to generate low levels of average earnings 
and a concentration of people in the lower bound of the income distribution. It can also difficult the process of 
social  mobility,  since  job  opportunities  in  top  the  occupational  groups  and  restricted  to  few  well  educated 
workers.

Despite some improvements, the occupational  structure in  Brazil is  still characterized by  routinized 
 
and  low  paid  service  occupations.  A  more  detailed  picture  of  these  groups  (Table  5)  shows  that  the  most 
representative  (two-digit)  occupations  in  2013  were  those  related  to  sales  (12.3%  in  2013),  building  and 
cleaning (8.9%), construction and extraction (8.7%). Occupations with average monthly earnings lower than 
200  dollars  in  2013.  Overall,  farming,  low  services,  sales  and  laborers  were  responsible  for  66%  of  the 
Brazilian  occupations  in  2013  (74%  in  1983),  and  just  38%  in  the  U.S.  (47%  in  1983).  In  turn,  skilled 
occupations,  which  usually  require  superior  diploma  and  are  better  paid,  such  as  biological  and  health, 
mathematics and related, social and human sciences, represented more than 15% of the occupation in the U.S. 
in 2013, and just 4% in Brazil.

In addition to remarkable differences between averages earnings in Brazil and in the U.S., there are 
other aspects of the occupational structure that must be highlighted. The average monthly earnings in the U.S. 
was, in 2013, 4.1 times higher than in Brazil (930 against 229), but the ratios differ significantly among the 
occupational groups. Differences are lower between top occupational groups. For example, average monthly 
earnings of sales and laborers was 4.1 higher in the U.S. (740 against 182 in 2013), and just 2.8 higher for 
professionals (1,332 against 483) and 2.3 higher for management occupations (1,321 against 569). Between 
two-digit occupational groups, the ratio is higher for construction and extraction workers (4.6) and lower for 
mathematics and related occupations (1.9).  
 
Since labor rewards for the most vulnerable social groups are relatively lower in Brazil than in the U.S., 
differences  between  occupational  groups  tend  to  be  higher  in  Brazil.  For  example,  the  average  monthly 
earnings of professionals in Brazil was 2.7 times higher than that of sales and laborers (1.8 in the US), and 
4.1 times higher than that of farming workers (2.6 times higher in the US). In other words, inequality between 
occupational  groups  is  higher  in  Brazil  due  mainly  to  the  more  extreme  conditions  of  remuneration  that 
workers are submitted to in bottom occupational groups in comparison to their American counterparts.  
Figure 4 summarizes the dynamics of the total earnings inequality between and within occupational 
 
groups in both countries (B and W, equations 7-9), as well as the Gini index for the total earnings inequality 
between 1983 and 2013. Despite the reduction in the gap between  Brazil and the U.S., earnings inequality 
continues higher in Brazil. The difference is higher when measured by the Theil index, since this indicator is 
more sensitive to the distribution in the extreme of the earnings distribution. In 2013, the Gini index in Brazil 
was 1 percentage point higher than in the U.S. and the Theil T was 6 percentage points higher. The share of 
bottom occupational groups is lower in the U.S. and their average earnings is higher than in Brazil. As a result, 
the total amount of earnings accumulated in the lower bound of the earnings distribution is higher in the U.S. 
than in Brazil.

Other  remarkable  result  is  the  difference  of  the  Theil  for  inequality  between  the  20  two-digit 
 
occupational  groups  (B).  This  indicator  is  substantially  higher  in  Brazil,  both  in  absolute  value  and  as  a 
percentage  of  the  total  inequality.  In  2013,  inequality  between  occupational  groups  contributed  with  14 
percentage points to the total inequality (35% of the total), and just 8 percentage points in the U.S. (24%). In 
turn, Theil for within inequality (W) was equal in both countries in 2013 (26 percentage points). In other words, 
differences in the patterns of earnings inequality of these countries were mainly due to the inequality between 
the occupational groups.  
The patterns of earnings inequity in these countries converged substantially after 30 year of decreasing 
 
trend in Brazil and increasing trend in the U.S.. After a long period of instability in the 80s and middle 90s, 
period characterized by low economic growth and hyperinflation, Gini index reduced 9 percentage points in 
Brazil between 1983 and 2013. In the U.S., it increased 2 percentage points. More remarkable differences are 
obtained  using  Theil  index,  suggesting  that  changes  were  more  pronounced  in  the  tails  of  the  earnings 
distribution.  Theil  index decreased  15  percentage  points in  Brazil  and increased  4  percentage  points  in  the 
U.S..  
 
Average earnings increased remarkably faster for bottom occupational groups in Brazil. For example, 
average hourly earnings more than doubled for farming (129%), low services (129%) and sales and laborers 
(101%). The growth for the main one-digit middle and top occupational groups, managers, professionals and 
specialists, was not higher than 75%. Wages for bottom groups in Brazil are largely influenced by the value 
of the minimum wage, which, as previously highlighted, grew substantially in this period. Moreover, the share 
of employees benefited by this and other labor regulations also increased faster in the period, contributing to 
increase overall average earnings9.  
 
In the U.S., the growth of 29% in the average earnings between 1983 and 2013was largely influenced 
by  the  dynamics  among  professionals  (variation  of  33%),  and,  in  lesser  extent,  managers  (24%).  Farming 
workers  witnessed  a  substantial  rise  in  their  earnings  (66%),  but  they  are  not  relevant  in  the  American 
occupational  structure  (0.6%  of  the  occupations  in  2013).  Average  earnings  increased  in  slower  pace  for 
routinized  sales  and  laborers  (12%),  intermediate  specialists  (19%)  and  the  bottom  low  services  workers 
(20%).  
 
Based on the changes in the structure of the occupational groups and in the patterns of inequality within 
each group, we can decompose the variation in the Theil T index between 1983 and 2013 into two main sources 
(equations  10-11):  i)  differences  between  occupational  groups  (Between  Effect);  and  ii)  differences  within 
occupational  groups  (Within  Effect).  Results  on Table  6  highlight  that  the  most  remarkable  contribution  to 
reduce inequality in Brazil was given by changes in the differences between occupational groups (9 percentage 
points). Average wages for most occupational groups are now closer to the national average, as well as the 
share of workers in middle occupational groups are higher than 30 years ago.  

The  only  exception  is  the  positive  Between  Effect  of  professionals,  which  contributed  to  increase 
inequality  in  5  percentage  points.  Since  the  average  earnings  of  this  group  grew  slower  than  the  national 
average,  the  share  of  income  accumulated  by  this  group  increased  in  the  period  due  to  the  rise  in  the 
participation of workers in this group (4 percentage points between 1983 and 2013). In turn, the accumulation 
of earnings by managers reduced due to both a slower growth of their average earnings as well as a decrease 
participation of workers in this group. As a result, managers contributed with more than 11 percentage points 
to reduce inequality between occupational groups in Brazil.

In  turn,  the  growth  of  earnings  inequality  in  the  U.S.  was  mainly  due  to  the  dynamics  of  top 
occupational  groups,  professionals  and  managers.  Professionals  contributed  with  7  percentage  points  to 
increase Theil index, due especially to the faster growth of its average earnings, which was 40% higher than 
the national  average in 2013, and due to  the increasing  inequality within  this group. For example, average 
hourly earnings grew more than 50% for  Legal, Biological and Health related occupations, the two groups 
with the highest average wages in the occupational structure. As a result, they contribute with 4 percentage 
points with between effect and 3 percentage points with the within effect. Despite the fact that the average 
earnings of managers grew almost in the same pace than the national average (24% and 29%, respectively), 
inequality within this group grew significantly, and they contributed with 2 percentage points to increase Theil 
index. 
The substantial growth of average earnings among low services occupations, group of the bottom of 
 
the occupational structure, contributed to reduce inequality in Brazil. In the U.S., the negative impact of this 
group  on  Theil  index  was  mainly  due  to  the  reduction  of  its  share  in  the  occupational  structure.  Average 
earnings also grew fast for the most vulnerable occupational group, farming. However this growth was offset 
by the substantial reduction in their participation and, as a result, faming contributed to increase inequality in 
both countries.  

Specialists are the group with average earnings closer to the national average (in 2013, 3% higher in 
Brazil and 19% lower in the US). Thus, the higher the participation of this group in the occupational structure, 

15 

the lower tend to be the levels of Between inequality. The participation of this group is still growing in Brazil 
(4 percentage points between 1983 and 2013), which played an important role reducing between inequality (4 
percentage points). Finally, sales and laborers had also important contribution to reduce inequality in Brazil 
and  in  the  U.S..  Mainly  because  earnings  are  more  equality  distributed  within  production  workers,  in  both 
countries. In Brazil, also because increased the share of sales workers (3 percentage points), occupations with 
higher average earnings in this group and closer to the national average. In the U.S., also because decreased 
the share of occupations with low average wage, such as installation and repair, transportation and moving. 

 

Occupational structure and social inequalities 
 
Some  of  the  differences  between  occupational  groups  may  also  be  related  to  other  types  of  social 
inequalities.  For  example,  part  of  the  differences  between  professionals  and  low  services  groups  would  be 
related  to  differences  in  the  level  of  educational  attainment,  age  or  region  of  residence  of  their  respective 
workers.  Similarly,  differences  would  also  reflect  some  types  of  segregation,  discrimination  or  other 
unmeasured factors that may be, for example, related to race, gender, and simultaneously, to the occupational 
structure.  
 
Table 7 presents the main social differences between the Brazilian and American employed population 
with  positive  earnings.  Results  highlight,  for  example,  remarkable  differences  between  the  levels  of 
educational attainment. In 2013, just 15% of the labor force with positive earnings had superior diploma in 
Brazil, against 46% in the U.S.. The American population is also more experienced, due to their more advanced 
stage of demographic transition. In 2013, 57% of the workers with 40 years or more, against 44% in Brazil.  
 
Although the percentages of black workers are similar in both countries (9% in Brazil and 11% in the 
U.S. in 2013), Brazil characterizes by its high share of other races (43% in 2013). This group contain yellow 
(Asian), indigenous and, specially, brown (Pardo, a descendant of an interracial marriage between white, black 
and/or indigenous). Women participation is growing yet in Brazil, but it was still 5 percentage points lower 
than in the U.S. in 2013. Finally, population in the U.S. is more equality distribute among the main 5 regions. 
In Brazil, the Southeast region was responsible for more than 45% of the employed population in 2013. The 
same Southeast region was the more populous in the U.S., with no more than one quarter of the workers.

Most social groups are also submitted to higher levels of earnings inequality in Brazil. For example, in 
2013, the average monthly earnings of those with superior diploma in Brazil was 3.4 times higher than that of 
those with elementary diploma or less. In the U.S., it was just 2.9 times higher. The average monthly earnings 
of white workers was 69% higher than that of black workers in Brazil and just 33% higher in the U.S.. The 
average monthly earnings in the richest region in Brazil (Southeast) was 67% higher than in the poorest region 
(Northeast), and 20% higher in the U.S. between the Northeast region, the richest, and Southeast, the poorest.  
 
The exceptions are the earning differentials between gender and age, which are substantially higher in 
the U.S.. For example, in 2013 the average monthly earnings of men was 50% higher than that of the women 
in the U.S. and 38% higher in Brazil. Differences in the levels of educational attainment may help explaining 
such differences, which are relatively higher for women in Brazil10. In turn, the average monthly earnings of 
adults between 40 and 49 years, for example, was 6.9 higher than that of young workers between 16 and 19 
years in the U.S. and just 2.7 times higher in Brazil. Differences that may be related to higher levels of intra-
generational mobility in the U.S..  
Differences  between  the  social  groups  followed  the  same  dynamics  witnessed  for  the  occupational 
 
groups: decreasing trend in Brazil and increasing trend in the U.S.. In Brazil, average earnings grew faster for 
some of the most vulnerable social groups: people with elementary education or less, young between 16 and 
19 and elderly with 60 years or more, black, female and those workers living in the poorest Northeast region. 
In the U.S., average earnings grew faster for those with superior diploma, elderly with 60 years or more, other 
races, female and those living in the richest Northeast region.  
 
Since these social characteristics tend to be interrelated with the occupational structure, we have now 
to consider the independent contribution of each factor to explain total inequality in Brazil and in the U.S.. 
Figure 5 presents the marginal contribution of each social characteristic, as well as that of the occupational 
structure, to explain total Theil index (equation 14). The Between inequality now represents the share of the 
total inequality due to the differences between the  multiple combinations of  groups defined by occupation, 
education, age, race, gender and region. The marginal contribution of education, for example, represents the 
share of the Between inequality that can be independently explained by the differences between the groups of 
educational  attainment,  after  the  differences  between  the  other  groups  are  controlled  for.  The  share  of  the 

                                                 
10  For  example,  in  2013  the  percentage  of  employed  population  with  positive  earnings  and  secondary  diploma  or  more  was  16 
percentage points higher for women in Brazil (62% for women and 46% for men), and just 3 percentage points higher in the U.S. 
(93% for women and 90% for men).

between  inequality  that  can  not  be  independently  explained  by  one  only  variable  is  represented  by  the 
interaction effect.

Results highlight, for example, that occupational structure remains as the main independent source of 
Between inequality in both countries, with contribution ranging from 5 percentage points in the U.S. to 6 in 
Brazil in 2013. Age and education are the second and third more relevant independent factors, contributing 
jointly with more 5 percentage points in the U.S. and 7 in Brazil. Gender and regional inequality are more 
relevant in Brazil, contributing jointly with 4 percentage points to total inequality (2 percentage points in the 
US). Race ranked last, with 1 percentage point to explain total inequality in each country.  
 
A remarkable difference between Brazil and the U.S. is the interaction effect, which is substantially 
higher in Brazil (6 percentage points in 2013, against 1 percentage point in the U.S.). This result indicates a 
higher  relation  between  social  characteristics  and  occupational  structure  in  Brazil,  which  also  play  a  more 
important  role  explaining  total  inequality  in  this  country.  After  the  differences  between  the  social  and 
occupational groups are controlled for, including the interaction effect, the inequality that remains within these 
groups are higher in the U.S.. Phenomenon that took particular place in the 2000, when the inequality decreased 
more incisively in Brazil and increased more sharply in the U.S.. 
 

Final considerations 
 
Brazil and the U.S. are notably known by their singular levels of socioeconomic inequality. Even with 
substantial improvements in the early 2000s, Brazil remains with extreme levels of inequality, significantly 
higher than the U.S.. Bottom and middle groups in this country are submitted to levels of per capita income 
extremely low compared to their American counterparts. A huge concentration of people in the lower bound 
of the income distribution in Brazil is mainly a result of its labor market structure, which is overrepresented 
by  low  skilled  and  low  paid  occupational  groups.  Top  and  middle  income  groups,  such  as  professionals, 
technical and administrative support occupations, are not representative like in the U.S..  

As a result, differences between occupational groups are largely higher in Brazil, especially between 
occupations in  the upper and lower bounds of the occupational  structure. Brazil is  historically known  by  a 
labor structure characterized by extreme levels of segmentation (Ulyssea, 2006). A small share of high skilled 
workers attains better job opportunities in a more structured labor market, characterized by better access to 
high technology and compliance with the labor legislation. In turn, a large majority of low skilled workers 
concentrates in low paid services, farming and other routinized occupations, most of them submitted to extreme 
conditions of remunerations and devoid of a series of social benefits guaranteed by the labor legislation.  

18 

 
A  good  news  in  this  country  is  that  inequality  reduced  substantially  in  the  2000s.  Social  benefits 
explains some of this fall, but a main responsible is the labor market. Benefited by the commodity boom and 
unusual  economic  growth  in  the  period,  labor  market  in  Brazil  produced  more  jobs  and  higher  wages.  Per 
capita income of the poorest was benefited by important social policies implemented in the 1990s and 2000s, 
such as cash transfer programs and the pension system. But labor income of the poorest also grew substantially, 
pushed mainly by the appreciation of the minimum wage, which almost doubled in the period.  

Labor income remains as the main source of self-reported income in households and tend to dictate the 
dynamics of the total inequality. In the U.S., the share of labor income in the household is even higher and the 
substantial gains of the richest workers has been the main responsible for the rise in inequality since the 1980s. 
High skilled professionals and management occupations were specially benefited in this period, fact that has 
been attributed to the emergence of an informational society and the lack of balance between the demand and 
supply of these qualified workers.  
 
Economic dynamics in the U.S. has shown to be highly demanding of skilled professional occupations. 
In addition to management occupations, professionals were the only occupational groups who increased their 
share  in  the  American  occupational  structure,  and  some  workers  in  these  groups  were  especially  benefited 
increasing  their earnings and, consequently,  Between and Within  inequality.  In  Brazil, economic growth  is 
still related to a decreasing participation of low bottom farming occupations and increasing participation of 
middle and bottom income occupational groups, such as specialists and low services. The overall impact on 
total inequality was negative, since average earnings of these latter groups are closer to the national average. 
Additionally, their average earnings grew faster than the average, also contributing to reduce Within inequality. 
The  most  vulnerable  occupational  groups  tend  to  be  mainly  affected  in  periods  of  recession,  losing 
their jobs or reducing their relative wages, which contributes to increase inequality. For example, dot-com and 
sub-prime crises  in  the 2000s  affected specially the labor income of the poorest in  the U.S..  In Brazil, this 
group was not largely affected by international crises, since the demands for commodities continued high and 
institutions, such as minimum wage, played an important role guiding the raise of the earnings in the bottom 
occupational groups.  
Part of the inequalities between occupational groups can be explained by the social characteristics of 
 
their respective workers. For example, the percentage of workers with no more than secondary education is 
much larger in Brazil than in the U.S., and they are mainly concentrated in the bottom occupational groups. 
Inequalities between occupational and social groups, defined by education, age, race, gender and region, are 
significant  in  both  countries,  and  they tend also  to be higher in  Brazil. Nonetheless,  occupational  structure 
remains as the main source of inequalities in both countries, even after differences between social groups are 
controlled for.  
 

Conclusions 

The  distribution  of  workers  among  the  occupational  groups  has  shown  to  be  an  important  factor  to 
explain differences in the levels of inequality between Brazil and the U.S.. Earnings inequality is  higher in 
Brazil  particularly  because  differences  between  occupational  and  social  groups  are  higher  in  this  country, 
which reflect a society characterized by high levels of socioeconomic segmentation.  

Moreover,  changes  in  the  occupational  structure  tend  naturally  to  affect  earnings  distribution  and, 
consequently, income inequality. For example, the rise of the participation of top occupational groups tend to 
increase average earnings and inequality, especially when this dynamics is not sufficiently offset by a reduction 
in  the  earnings  differentials  within  or  between  these  groups.  The  exception  would  be  a  society  where  top 
occupations represented the large majority of the labor structure and their average earnings were closer to the 
national average. But this is still a hypothetical case, even in the U.S., where the rise of the participation of the 
most representative top occupational group, professionals, has contributed substantially to increase inequality.
