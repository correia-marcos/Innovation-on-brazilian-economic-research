A  recessão  da  economia  brasileira  tem  provocado  uma  intensa  discussão  a  respeito  de 
estratégias  de  recuperação  da  atividade  econômica.  Este  artigo  pretende  contribuir  para  o 
debate  elencando  os  setores  que  quando  estimulados  teriam  o  maior  potencial  de  retirar  a 
economia  da  recessão.  Para  tal,  emprega-se  o  método  eigenvector  desenvolvido  por 
Dietzenbacher (1992). Primeiramente, estimou-se a matriz de insumo-produto brasileira para 
o  ano  de  2013  usando  o  método  elaborado  por  Guilhoto  e  Sesso  (2005).  A  partir  daí,  foi 
possível utilizar o método eigenvector para encontrar as ligações intersetoriais para trás. Os 
resultados destacam a importância das atividades de refino de petróleo e coque, fabricação de 
resinas e elastômeros, produtos e preparações químicas e produtos químicos para estimular a  
economia.  No  entanto,  os  setores  tradicionais  de  construção  e  fabricação  de  automóveis

Abstract 

The  current  recession  in  Brazil  has  provoked  intense  discussion  concerning  ways  to  boost 
economic activity. This paper intends to contribute to the debate by ranking the sectors that 
have the power to pull the economy out of the recession when they are stimulated, employing 
the eigenvector method developed by Dietzenbacher (1992). To that end, we first estimated 
the  Input-Output  Matrix  for  2013  applying  Guilhoto  and  Sesso  (2005)'s  methodology    and 
build  an  I-O  Matrix  from  the  National  Statistical  Accounts.  Later,  we  employed  the 
eigenvector method to find the inter-sector backward linkages and ranked them. The results 
highlight the importance of petroleum refining and coke, resin manufacturing and elastomers, 
various  chemical  products  and  preparations,  and  chemicals  to  boost  the  recovery  of  the 
economy. Nonetheless, the traditional sectors of construction and automotive manufacturing 
exhibited poor and modest results respectively.

1. Introduction  

The Brazilian economy has presented a sluggish economic performance in the last few years. 
Currently the country has entered into a deep recession without any sign of recovery ahead. A 
recessionary state followed by rising prices has emerged.  

In  this  context,  'developmentalism'  is  a  school  of  economic  thought  that  has  suggested 
policies to overcome the crisis. 'Developmentalism' has many branches. Two of them are the 
'new  developmentalism'  and  'social-developmentalism'.  They  have  suggested  different 
policies to stimulate the economy. The former claims that exchange rate  devaluation would 
pave the way to foster growth. Bresser Pereira (2007, 2011) and Oreiro (2012, 2014) represent 
this  group.  The  latter  argues  that  redistribution  toward  the  poor  is  crucial  to  stimulate  the 
domestic market and trigger growth. Bastos (2012) represents 'social-developmentalism'. (For 
further discussion, see Amado and Mollo (2015)). 

Arguably a profound knowledge about the productive structure would help to shed light 
on  sectors  that  can  boost  the  economy.  However,  most  of  the  researchers  have  paid  scant 
attention to mesoeconomics. In other words, in these proposals lacks an study of the role of 
sectors to trigger the economy. Each sector has specific features that should be included in the 
analysis.  

In this paper, we built the Input-Output (I-O) Matrix for Brasil for 2013 and applied the 
Dietzenbacher (1992)'s eingenvector methodology to rank the sectors in terms of their 'power 
of  pull'  (or  backward  linkages).  We  employed  the  well-known  methodology  proposed  by 
Guilhoto and Sesso (2005) to construct an I-O matrix from the National Statistical Accounts. 
Having  this  matrix,  we  estimate  interindustry  linkages,  giving  further  information  about 
sectors'  power  to  pull  the  economy  out  of  the  recession.  Following  Luo  (2013,  p.  158),  we 
define 'power of pull' as the sectors' capacity to pull all the activities through their networks. 
Sectors'  size  and  networks  matter  in  determining  the  effect  of  one  sector  on  the  rest  of  the 
economy.  The  linkage  indicators  provide  a  measure  of  the  total  amount  of  inputs  required 
from  the  activities  to  produce  one  additional  unit  of  final  demand,  including  the  network 
effect.  The paper also investigates the structural tranformation of the Brazilian economy from 
2010 to 2013.   

The  eigenvector  method  presents  some  advantages  in  comparison  with  conventional 
methods such as the Rasmussen and Hirschman linkage indicators. The advantages are related 
to  its  sensitivity  to  structural  transformation,  capability  to  find  clusters  of  activities,  and  it 
gives  a  powerful  measure  of  interactivity  linkages.  Specifically  in  this  regard,  this  method 
gives  a  larger  weight  to  the  inputs  from  an  activity  presenting  high  backward  linkage  than 
otherwise, representing an efficient procedure to measure interindustry linkages.    

The structural sequencing of the rest of the paper is as follows. Next, we overview the 
Brazilian  economy  during  the  2000s.  We  present  a  brief  review  of  techniques  to  measure 
backward linkages in Section 2. In the following section, we present the eigenvector method. 
The remaining two sections exhibit results and conclusions.  

2. The Brazilian Economy in the 2000s: A Brief Overview  

The Brazilian economy has grown vigorously since the middle of the 2000s. Between 2004 
and 2010, per capita GDP rose by 2.8% per  year, even  after the  effects of the international 
financial  crisis  of  2008.  However,  despite  recovering  a  certain  degree  of  dynamism,  the 
country grew slower than in 1950-1973 (United Nations, 2010). 

The  international  context  up  to  2008  contributed  to  the  economic  results  reached  in 
Brazil. The global economy grew substantially, mainly driven by China and India. In the early 
2000s, Brazil benefited from rising exports and increasing international prices. Brazil became 
less prone to international crises, receiving large amount of net direct investment. When the 
international  crisis  unfolded,  Brazil  had  international  reserves  and  the  capacity  to  employ 
countercyclical policies. 

A  crucial  feature  of  the  expansion  was  the  development  of  the  domestic  market, 
containing  three  central  measures.  Firstly,  the  Brazilian  government  adopted  a  plan  to 
stimulate  economic  development.  The  Growth  Acceleration  Plan  (PAC)  represented  the 
recovery of the State’s role in planning, coordination of public investments and cooperation 
with private firms.  

Secondly, government applied redistributive policies, such as the Bolsa Família, a family 
subsidy  programme,  and  real  increases  in  the  minimum  wage,    boosting  consumption  and 
triggering the economy. As a result, an improvement in the income distribution has emerged, 
with the Gini coefficient dropping from 0.61 in 1990 to 0.54 in 2009 (IPEA, 2011). 

Thirdly, the rise of credit supply from the financial market was important, with the State-
owned  banks  leading  the  process.  The  amount  of  credit  in  relation  to  GDP  surged 
considerably from 2000 to 2010. 

The domestic-market-led expansion policy lead to a drop in the unemployment rate. The 
rise in formal employment was essential  to guarantee political and social stability. Moreover, 
reducing inequality can stimulate growth, for two major reasons. Firstly, it improves people’s 
nutrition, translating into labour productivity gains. Income redistribution diminishes poverty, 
having positive effects on health and education (Deaton, 2003), supporting further increases 
in  labour  productivity.  Secondly,  it  is  easier  to  reach  consensus  to  implement  reforms  in 
egalitarian economies. 

Despite  the  growth  experienced,  the  persistent  exchange  rate  overvaluation  started  to 
damage  industry's  performance.  To  keep  momentum,  the  government  gave  tax  cuts  to  the 
automotive  sector  and  promoted  incentives  for  agglomeration.  The  development  model 
achieved its limit by 2014. After 2014, the Brazilian economy began slowing down. In 2015, 
Brazil entered into a political and economic crisis followed by a recession, with the collapse 
of private and public investment. There is no clear sign that the economy will overcome the 
crisis soon.  
3. Ranking Sector's Linkages: A Brief Review  

In the input-output literature, key sectors are defined as sectors that present high and above 
average  backward  and  forward  linkages.  Several  criteria  were  developed  to  investigate  the 
importance of activities to engender economic expansion. Firstly, the simpler method - based 
on the Leontief's contribution - involves the sum of lines of the coefficient matrix A to assess 
backward  (direct)  linkages.  It  represents  a  measure  of  the  total  input  required  directly  to 
produce one unit of output. Further extensions employed the Leontief inverse matrix to give 
the total effect. The sum of the rows of this matrix gives the direct and indirect (total) inputs 
needed as a result of the increase of one unit of final demand. Moreover, there are plenty of 
more sophisticated methods: fields of influence (Hewings et al., 1989), triangulation (Korte 
and Oberhofer, 1971), hypothetical extraction (Schultz, 1977), and eigenvector method. The 
latter  presents  an  advantage  since  it  gives  a  higher  weight  to  inputs  from  sectors  with  high 
backward linkage indicators.  It is  an iterative method, connected to networks. Here, we are 
interested in the eigenvector procedure only. Now lets provide a brief introduction about the 

backward and forward linkage indicators and review few studies that applied the eigenvector 
technique. Our focus here is on the backward linkage indicator.  

One important and well-established method to find direct bacward linkage indicators was 
developed by Chenery and Watanabe (C-W) (1958). They worked with the coefficient matrix 
A.  As before, the row sums indicate the total amount of inputs directly required to produce 
one additional unit of output. Mathematicaly, it is represented by the left pre-multiplication of 
the  A  matrix  by  a  unitary  vector.  The  weighted  Chenery  and  Watanabe  (1958)  direct 
backward linkage index (m) can be expressed as  

m= ne'A/e'Ae. (1) 

Where n is the number of sectors in the economy; e' stands for a row summation vector (ei=1 
for all i), A is the input coefficiente matrix, and e is the column summation vector (ei=1 for all 
i).  

Rasmussen  (1956)  worked  with  the  Leontief  matrix  to  design  an  index  of  backward 
linkages.  Its  index  exhibits  how  much  the  output  (direcly  and  indirectly)  of  the  economy 
should grow to match an increase in demand in one specific sector. It is represented by the 
row  sums  of  the  Leontief  matrix.  The  total  (indirect  plus  direct)  Rasmussen  backward 
linkages indicator z can be exhibited as

 is the Leontief matrix. 

Conversely, the forward linkage indicators are calculated as a sum of each column in the 
Leontief matrix. They show how much a sector will produce (directly  and indirectly)  when 
the demand of all sectors increases by one unit. Overall, key-sectors present high backward 
and forward linkages (above average). Here again, our focus is on power of pull so we intend 
to  look  at  backward  linkages  only.  Our  concern  is  to  investigate  sectors'  power  to  pull  the 
economy out of the recession. 

Now  that  we  have  sketched  the  basic  features  of  backward  linkages,  we  can  proceed 
reviewing  some  studies  that  apply  the  eigenvector  method.  Firstly,  Dietzenbacher  (1992) 
measured  interindustry  linkages  for  The  Netherlands  from  1948  to  1984  to  rank  economic 
sectors. He shows that using the eigenvector procedure researchers can find robust estimations 
of backward and forward linkages. Moreover, this method is able to detect structural change 
and to find clusters of producers. Dietzenbacher shows the method's superiority in comparison 
to well-established procedures such as the Chenery and Watanabe (1958) and the Rasmussen 
(1956) method.  

Another  empirical  paper  that  employes  the  procedure  is  Luo  (2013).  He  analyses  the 
input-output data for U.S. during the 1998-2010 period. His goal was to rank the sectors that 
should  be  first  bailed  out  in  the  U.S.  economy.  He  also  applied  a  conterfactual  analysis  to 
verify if the government stimulated the right sectors during the great recession of 2008/2009. 
His  results  underscore  the  necessity  to  bail  out  the  mothor  vehicle  sector,  but  it  does  not 
support  bailing  out  public  infrastructure,  health  care,  computer  and  electronics,  and  service 
sectors.  Overall,  the  author  seems  sckeptical  concerning  the  policies  adopted  by  president 
Obama.

Other studies concentrate the analysis on inter-industry linkages for regional input-output 
(I-O) tables. In particular, Midmore at al. (2006) assess industry linkages through the Welsh 
Financial I-O matrix. They employed Dietzenbacher (1992)'s method, finding different ranks 
for  sectors  according  to  each  method  applied.  Their  results  underscore  the  importance  of 
employing  efficient  techniques  to  capture  inter-industry  linkages,  supporting  regional 
planning.  
 
4. Data and Methodology  

 

This  section  describes  Dietzenbacher  (1992)'s  eigenvector  method.  The  source  of  statistical 
data  comes  from  the  national  statistical  accounts  of  the  Instituto  Brasileiro  de  Geografia  e 
Estatística  (IBGE).  Because  we  have  only  the  official  I-O  table  for  2005,  the  Input-Output 
table was derived from national statistical accounts for 2013. The Resources and Uses table 
(containing 107 commodities and 51 activities) provides the complete information needed to 
construct the I-O table. Specifically, we employed the Resources and Uses Table to built the 
input-output (I-O) matrix following Guilhoto and Sesso (2005). For more details, see Morrone 
(2015). 

The Input-Output table for Brazil contains 51 sectors. The sectors of the disaggregated I-
O are: agriculture, forestry, and logging (1), livestock and fisheries (2), oil and natural gas (3), 
iron  ore  (4),  other  mining  and  quarrying  (5),  food  and  beverages  (6),  tobacco  products  (7), 
textiles  (8),  articles  of  apparel  and  accessories  (9),  leather  goods  and  footwear  (10),  wood 
products - furniture exclusive (11), pulp and paper products (12), newspapers, magazines, and 
discs  (13),  petroleum  refining  and  coke  (14),  alcohol  (15),  chemicals  (16),  resin 
manufacturing and elastomers (17), pharmaceutical products (18), pesticides (19), perfumery 
hygiene  and  cleanliness  (20),  enamels  varnishes  paints  and  lacquers  (21),  various  chemical 
products  and  preparations  (22),  rubber  and  plastic  (23),  cement  and  other  non-  metallic 
mineral products (24), steel manufacturing and derivatives (25), non- ferrous metallurgy (26), 
metal products - except machinery and equipment (27), machinery and equipment including 
maintenance and repairs (28), appliances and electronic equipment (29), office machines and 
equipment,  and  electronic  materials  (30),  automotive  manufacturing  (31),  parts  and 
accessories for motor vehicles (32), other transport equipment (33), furniture and products of 
various industries (34), production and distribution of electricity gas water sewage and urban 
cleaning  (35),  construction  (36),  trade  (37),  transport  storage  and  postal  services  (38), 
information  services  (39),  financial  intermediation,  insurance  and  pension  plan,  and  related 
services  (40),  real  estate  activities  and  rentals  (41),  maintenance  and  repair  services  (42), 
accommodation  and  food  services  (43),  business  services  (44),  commercial  education  (45), 
commercial health (46), services rendered to families and associations (47), domestic services 
(48), public education (49), public Health (50), and public administration and social security 
(51).  
 
4.1 The Eigenvector Method  

The  Dietzenbacher's  method  represent  an  infinite  iterative  procedure  to  measure  and  rank 
intersector  backward  and  forward  linkage  indicators.  The  method  addresses  the  infinite 
iterative process of power of nodes in networks (Luo 2013, p. 160). Here, I borrow notation 
from Luo (2013).  

The  procedure  can  be  presented  as  follows.  Firstly,  suppose  ri  stands  for  the  vector  of 
backward linkage indicators of the activities of the economy. Next, the vector ri+1 through an 
iterative procedure is updated as the summation of linkages (columns of the input coefficient 
matrix A) and it is weighted by the normalized ri from the previous iteration. It makes sense 
to  give  a  larger  weight  to  the  inputs  of  the  activities  with  high  backward  linkages  than  the 
inputs from a sector with a smaller one. The indicators are normalized (to show an average of 
1), and can be expressed as 

ri+1 = nr'iA/(r'iAe)                             (3) 

 

where n stands for the total number of activitities and e is the column summation vector (ei = 
1  for  all  i).  The  estimation  of  power  indicators  is  improved  through  iterations  to  infinitum 
(i→∞). 

Dietzenbacher (1992, p. 420) shown that the outcome of the procedure converges to the 
normalized left hand eigenvector which corresponds to the dominant eigenvalue (the Perron 
vector)  of  the  matrix  A.  The  weighting  vector  is  estimated  as  nq'/(q'e)  with  q'A  =  λq'  (4). 
Where q' represents the dominant eigenvalue of A. As a conclusion, the elements of nq'/(q'e) 
reveal the power of sectors to pull the activities of the whole economy.   

Note  that  the  "power  of  pull"  (ri)  is  independent  on  the  original  weighting  vector 
employed. It means that the weighting vector might be chosen arbitrarily in the first iteration. 
Moreover,  taking the final weighting vector into both equations (1) and (2) implies that the 
Chenery-Watanabe index and the Rasmussen index are identical.  

this  method, 

In  summary,  the  eigenvector  method  considers  both  inter-sector  linkage  weighting  and 
infinite  iterative  process  to  capture  the  influences  towards  the  whole  economy.  For  further 
information  about 
its  superiority,  and  mathematical  derivation,  see 
Dietzenbacher (1992). Next, we employ this procedure to measure and to rank interindustry 
backward linkages for Brazil for 2013. 
 
5. Results  

This section reports on the results of the sector's backward linkage indicators. It serves as a 
proxy of the 'power of pull' of the entire economy, revealing sectors that should be bailed out 
first during a recession. We rank them according to their capacity to boost economic activity, 
leading  to  a  robust  recovery.  Here  the  purpose  is  threefold  and  displayed  in  the  following 
tables.  Firstly, we compare the results of the Chenery and Watanabe (C-W) linkage with the 
Rasmussen index and the eigenvector's method result. Next, the outcome of the eigenvector 
method is analyzed. Then, we follow the ranked sectors from 2010 to 2013 and discuss them 
in the context of Brazil.  

Table 1 exhibits the values and rankings of the 20 sectors with the highest Chenery and 
Watanabe backward linkages and the Rasmussen and eigenvector indicators for 2013. Results 
for the 51 sectors are in the appendix. At the top of the table is Petroleum refining and coke 
(14) sector, followed by food and beverages (6), Alcohol (15), and pulp and paper products 
(12). These sectors have potential to support the recovery.  

However,  a  closer  look  at  the  numbers  reveal  that  they  might  be  misleading.  The 
Rasmussen  index  presents  a  different  sector  ranking.  For  instance  pulp  and  paper  products 
(12) presents the fourth highest score in the C-W method, but it is the third in the Rasmussen 

index. In addition, sector 24  appears among the top 20 using only the Rasmussen index. For 
the top 20 sectors in the C-W method, we found a Pearson correlation coefficient of 79.67% 
in terms of rank.  In conclusion, the results, although close, show some divergence.  The high 
correlation for C-W and Rasmussen indicators found, shows that there is not much difference 
between the two methods.  

Turning now to the eigenvector's elements, we see that the divergence becomes deeper. If 
we compare the correlation between C-W and the eigenvector method, the Pearson correlation 
coefficient takes the value of only 47.64%. Looking at rank, it drops to 38.37%. For example, 
articles of apparel and accessories (9) is only the seventeenth highest C-W score, but it is the 
second  using  the  eigenvector  method.  This  sector  has  medium  size,  but  it  is  powerful  to 
stimulate  the  rest  of  the  economy  through  the  network.  It  suggests  that  the  C-W  procedure 
takes  into  account  the  size  of  the  sector  only,  implying  crucial  negative  consequences  for 
planning.    These  results  are  similar  and  in  line  with  Dietzenbacher  (1992),  Midmore  et  al. 
(2006), and Luo (2013). 

Last  but  not  least,  the  Rasmussen  index  and  the  eigenvector  indicator  revealed  modest 
Pearson correlation coefficients. In a nutshell, it underscores the importance to estimate key 
sectors employing efficient methods that detect network power.

Table  2  shows  the  elements  with  the  largest  backward  linkages  in  Brazil  using  the 
eigenvector method. Five sectors are crucial to pull the economy: petroleum refining and coke 
(14),  resin  manufacturing  and  elastomers  (17),  various  chemical  products  and  preparations 
(22), non- ferrous metallurgy (26), and Chemicals (16). They are the ones to stimulate during 
a recession. This serves as an input to guide development policies.

Finally,  Table  3  depicts  the  eigenvector  indicators  for  the  top  20  sectors  in  2010  and 
follows  them  from  2010  to  2013.  The  results  for  the  51  sectors  are  in  the  Appendix.  They 
serve as a proxy for the structural transformation of the Brazilian economy. Here, the statistics 
exhibit a substantial structural change. Sector 19 for instance, occupied second place in 2010, 
dropping  to  eighth  in  2013.  Across  the  board,  sector  14  delivers  the  highest  results.  Other 
important sectors are resin manufacturing and elastomers (17) and various chemical products 
and preparations (22).  Taking the average and ranking the elements of Table 3, the five most 
important sectors in the period are petroleum refining and coke (14), resin manufacturing and 
elastomers  (17),  various  chemical  products  and  preparations  (22),  chemicals  (16),  and 
pesticides (19).  

Pesticides (19),  pulp and paper products (12), varnishes, paints and lacquers (21), non- 
ferrous metallurgy (26), steel manufacturing and derivatives (25), automotive manufacturing 
(31), and parts and accessories for motor vehicles (32) all showed deteriorated network power 
to increase output of the economy.  Food and beverages (6) and chemicals (16) are relatively 
stable over the period. Notice the absence of traditional agriculture sectors in Table 3.   

Moreover, construction, a traditional sector, reveals limited capacity to pull the economy 
out  of  the  recession.  Other  sectors  like  automotive  manufacturing  (31)  overall  exhibited  a 
modest  power  to  stimulate  the  economy,  although  its  size  is  relevant.  Information  services 
(39) and financial intermediaries (4) have little influence in triggering economic activity. For 
details, see Table 6 in the Appendix. 

Nevertheless, the results should be interpreted around the benchmark  year (2013) since 
this is the lattest official statistic available to build the I-O matrix. Extensions of the results to 
the  current  period  should  be  interpreted  with  a  grain  of  salt.  In  the  absence  of  a  profound 
change in the Brazilian economic structure, then the sectors in Table 3 need to be stimulated.  

The  results  suggest  therefore  that  traditional  sectors  have  a  limited  power  to  foster 
economic  activity.  The  government's  strategy  should  focus  on  sectors  with  large  backward 
linkages  to  rapidly  overcome  the  recession.  Simple  policies  of  expanding  credit  supply  and 
giving tax cuts to the automotive manufacturing sector might not function this time. It seems 
unlikely that the recovery will come from agriculture either.

This  paper  has  applied  the  Dietzenbacher  (1992)'s  eigenvector  method  to  rank  sectors 
according to their power to pull the Brazilian economy out of the recession. This innovative 

method can shed light on the discussions about which sectors should be stimulated during the 
crisis. We have built a recent 2013 I-O matrix to compute the backward linkage indicators. 

The  results  indicate  that  five  activities  are  key  to  stimulate  the  economy:  petroleum 
refining  and  coke,  resin  manufacturing  and  elastomers,  various  chemical  products  and 
preparations, non- ferrous metallurgy, and Chemicals. These results are crucial as a guide for 
development  policies.  Traditional  sectors  do  not  exhibit  high  scores.  In  particular, 
construction  and  automotive  manufacturing  show  a  poor  and  modest  performance 
respectively. It suggests that to overcome this recession  requires other policies and incentives 
for different sectors.  

The results thus show that governement policies must emphasize strategic sectors. Like 
the ones displayed in Table 3. Taking extreme measures becomes vital to fight this recession. 
The  tradicional  macro  development  models  pay  scant  attention  to  mesoeconomics.  In  this 
vein, the paper provides a mesoeconomic perspective to tackle Brazil's problems.
