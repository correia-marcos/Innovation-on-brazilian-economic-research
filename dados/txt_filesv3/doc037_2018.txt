ABSTRACT 

 
This paper investigates  the behavior  of financial  intermediation  through  the analysis  of a panel 
of  101  Brazilian  banks.  For  that,  we  develop  a  measure  that  expresses  the  financ ial 
intermediation 
and  analyze  macroeconomic  and  banking  determinants  of  financial 
intermediation.  The results  indicate  an increase in  non-performing  loans  and a tight  monetary 
policy  increases financial  friction,  and then leads to a reduction  in financial  intermediation.     
The results indicate  an increase in non-performing  loans and a tight  monetary policy  increases 
financial  friction,  and  then  leads  to  a  reduction  in  financial  intermediation.  We  also  find  a 
negative  reaction  of financial  intermediation  to  depreciation  of exchange. The results  remain 
when the sample is segmented into  three non-overlapping  periods to isolate  the global  financial 
crisis.  Therefore,  the  financial  intermediation  measure  developed  in  this  study  offers  the

1. Introduction 

 

intermediation 

The  behavior  of  financial 

is  crucial  to  the  understanding  of  economic 
performance  (King  and  Levine,  1993).  The  global  financial  crisis  (GFC)  revealed  that  the  behavior  of 
financial  intermediation  also  plays a central role  in  maintaining  financial  stability  (Woodford,  2010).  The 
sudden  stop of the  financial  flows  to the economy  and the  consequent credit  crunch are aspects that have 
amplified  the effect of the crisis (Calvo,  Izquierdo  and Talvi,  2006;  Mendoza,  2010). Nowadays, one of the 
concerns  of  policymakers  is  to  monitor  the  behavior  of  financial  intermediation,  in  order  to  avoid  the 
outbreak of financial  instability  events. 

Financial  intermediation  is  a solution  to  the informational  problem  between  the surplus  and 
deficit  income  units  (Leland  and  Pile,  1977).  The  absorption  by  the  financial  intermediaries  of  the 
information  asymmetry  in  the lender-borrower  relationship  gives  rise to credit risk,  which  is  the potential 
loss  arising  from  the possibility  that a business  will  fail  to  fully  meet its  contractual  obligations  on  time 
(Guo,  2013).  Thus,  it  is  expected  that  credit  default  will  affect the  behavior  of  financial  intermediation 
performed by banks. 

Credit default is also related to financial  frictions  due to the deterioration  of the creditworthiness 
of  borrowers  (Adrian,  Colla  and  Shin,  2013).  Therefore,  increasing  credit  defaults  affect negatively  the 
risks associated to new lending,  damaging  financial  intermediation  through  the supply  of credit. When that 
happens,  banks  fail  to  efficiently  intermediate  funds  for  investment  and  consumption,  compromising 
financial  stability.  Since  financial  stability 
is  associated  with  the  continuous  process  of  financial 
intermediation  carried out by  banks,  financial  frictions  pose a threat to the continued  process of financial 
intermediation. 

One of the causes of the GFC was the increase in  the amount  of problem  credits in  the banks' 
portfolio.  Previously  to the crisis,  credit risk transfer carried out through  financial  innovations  was believed 
to mitigate  the impact  of delinquency  on  financial  intermediation  (Brunnermeier,  2009).  The outbreak  of 
the crisis revealed that defaults amplified  it and affected financial  intermediation  to the point  where a credit 
crunch was established  (Drehmann, Borio  and Tsatsaronis,  2011). Although  financial  intermediation  is the 
cornerstone  of  financial  stability 
(Schinasi,  2004;  BCBS,  2010),  studies  that  measure  financial 
intermediation  are still  rare. 

The objective  of this  study  is  to measure the process of financial  intermediation  and  analyze  
the effect of  financial  frictions  on financial  intermediation  through  empirical  evidence from  the Brazilian 
experience. In the Brazilian  financial  system, the main institutions  are constituted  as universal  banks, which 
provide  a wide range of banking  services and with assets exceeding 100 percent of GDP. Relatively  to other 
emerging  countries  and  other  Latin  American  peers,  the  Brazilian  banking  system  is  less  globally 
integrated.  Foreign  banks  control  around  17  percent  of  total  assets and  16  percent  of  deposits,  while 
domestic  banks have limited  foreign  lending  and borrowing,  around 6 percent of their assets and liabilit ies 
(IMF,  2012,  p. 5).  Moreover,  to maintain  financial  stability,  the  Central  Bank of  Brazil  (CBB) needs to 
monitor  the regular  operation,  over time  and in  any economic  scenario,  of the system responsible  for the 
financial  intermediation  among  households,  non-financial  corporations  and  the  government 1 .  In  this 
context,  the  architecture  of  the  Brazilian  banking  system,  as well  as the  role  performed  by  the CBB  in 
monitoring  financial  stability,  present  features that  can  be  useful  to  analyze  the  behavior  of  financial 
intermediation  and allow  one to use variables  present in the banking  literature  (non-performing  loan,  credit 
growth,  liquidity  and bank size)  and macroeconomic  measures as interest rates, exchange rates and output 
gap. 

In  this  study,  we  develop  a  new  variable,  financial  intermediation  flow  (FIF)  and  a  new 
indicator,  financial  intermediation  (FI), both measures of financial  intermediation,  using  data gathered from 
the Central Bank of Brazil's  (CBB) financial  analysis  report.  Using  a dynamic  panel data framework  that 
draws on 101 banks  (December 2000  to December 2015),  we find  that a depreciation  of exchange rate and 
an increase in  non-performing  loans  leads  to a reduction  in  financial  intermediation.  This  result  holds  in 
different  time  frames, such as the pre-crisis  period,  the crisis  period  and the post-crisis  period.  Moreover,

we also  find  that a tight  monetary  policy  increases financial  friction.  This  result  adds to the debate about 
the effects of monetary policy  on the stability  of the financial  system (Smets, 2014). 

The present study is organized  as follows.  Section  2 presents  a brief  literature  review. Section 
3 describes the data, including  the development  of the financial  intermediation  measures, and presents the 
methodology.  In section  4, the results  of estimates  of the effect of credit  risk  on  financial  intermediation 
are discussed. Section  5 presents the robustness  checks. Section  6 concludes. 
 
2 Financial  intermediation and credit risk 

According  to Dewatripont  and  Tirole  (1994)  and Freixas  and  Rochet (1997),  capital  markets 
imperfections  allow  for the emergence of the  financial  intermediary.  The  financial  intermediary  absorbs 
the  frictions  arising  from  information  asymmetry  and  transaction  costs  present  in  the  lender-borrower 
relationship.  As a consequence,  adverse selection  and moral  hazard  arises, as well  as credit risk,  a central 
element in  the financial  intermediation  activity. 

As Mishkin  (1992)  points  out,  adverse selection  occurs  before the  transaction  is  completed, 
while  moral  hazard  occurs  after the  transaction  is  completed.  Adverse  selection  takes  place  when  bad 
potential  borrowers (worst credit risks) are those most likely  to  borrow. In such a hostile  environment,  the 
lender may choose not to grant credit,  even though  there are good  potential  borrowers in the market place. 
Another consequence of the difficulty  in determining  good and bad credit risks is the pricing  of projects by 
the average risk of borrowers. In this  case, good  potential  borrowers will  have their projects  undervalued 
and  may  choose  not  to  borrow.  On  the  other  hand,  bad  potential  borrowers  will  have  their  projects 
overvalued  and will  be stimulated  to borrow. 

Moral hazard unfolds  when the borrower chooses to conduct the business in a way that increases 
the  likelihood  of  default  after the credit  is  granted.  The  borrower  has  incentives  to  incur  in  higher  risk 
activities  since,  in  case of  failure,  the loss  will  be shared with  the  lender.  As for the lender,  information 
asymmetry makes it  hard to anticipate  such behavior  and avoid  the risk. 

Mishkin  (2000) resumes the argument of financial  intermediation  to relate it to crises. Financial 
intermediation  is  made possible  because it  addresses information  asymmetry  better  than capital  markets. 
Therefore a financial  crisis  is the exacerbation  of information  asymmetry  to such an extent that financial 
intermediation  is  severely  compromised  or  even disrupted.  Gertler  and  Karadi  (2011)  describe  financial 
intermediation  as a process  subject  to  frictions  and  provide  evidence  that  shocks  in  the  prices  of assets 
reduce the intensity  of financial  intermediation  and may result in bank crises. 

In general,  the literature  on  financial  intermediation  uses balance measures such as the credit-
to-GDP  ratio  as proxies  for financial  intermediation  (Levine,  Loayza  and Beck,  2000;  Beck and  Levine 
2004).  After  the  GFC,  the  work  of  De  Moraes  and  De  Mendonça  (2016)  seeks  to  express  financial 
intermediation  from financial  flows.   

Regarding  the  credit  risk  behavior,  Borio,  Furfine  and Lowe (2001)  and  Brunnermeier  et al. 
(2009) argue that credit risk is pro-cyclical  and amplifies  banks' expectations for the economy and the credit 
market. Thus,  the worsening  in  the expectations  of financial  intermediaries  for the credit market,  and the 
consequent increase in  credit risk,  may lead to a reduction  in financial  intermediation. 

Previous works in financial  stability  show a preference for the non-performing  loans  (NPL) as 
the credit  risk  measure (Cardone-Riportella,  Samaniego-Medina,  and Trujillo-Ponce,  2010  and Barcellos 
and  De Mendonça,  2015).  Besides  this,  Klein  (2013)  and  Horváth  and  Vasko (2016)  establish  a direct 
relationship  between  NPL and  financial  instability.  However,  none  of  these works  analyze  the  relation 
between  financial  intermediation  and  NPL. This  study  adds  to  this  debate  by  proposing  a  measure  of 
financial  intermediation  derived from financial  flows. This measure allows  one to estimate the role of NPL 
as a financial  friction  that can pose a threat to financial  intermediation. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 Data and methodology 

3.1 Measuring financial intermediation 

There is extensive  literature  about financial  crises. A challenge  for that literature  is to develop 
indicators  which  capture  financial  overheating  and  signal  potential  banking  distress  over  medium-term 
horizons  (BIS,  2016).  However,  this  study  focus on  day-by-day  financial  regulators  (Central  Banks) and 
their  task to monitor  financial  intermediation  and financial  instability  risk. As pointed  out  by  De Moraes 
and  De Mendonça  (2016),  financial  instability  does  not  mean  crisis,  but  the process of  deviation  in  the 
behavior  of financial  intermediation  from the equilibrium,  which  can build  up and cause a disruption  in the 
intermediation  system,  leading  to  a crisis.  This  study  builds  on  this  argument  and  develops  a financial 
intermediation  measure which  manages  to  capture  the  effective  financial  flows  that  constitute  financial 
intermediation.  Differently  from  the  extant  literature,  financial  intermediation 
is  not  proxied  by  its 
consequences,  but  measured  out  of  its  very  constituents,  namely  the  financial  flows  derived  from  the 
process of intermediation.   

In this  study  financial  intermediation  is  represented by  the actual exchange of financial  flows 
between economic  units and financial  intermediaries.  The measure of financial  intermediation  used derives 
the financial  intermediation  flow (FIF) from the financial  flows of assets and liabilities.  From the liabilit ies 
standpoint,  the net cash flow resulting  from the entry of new funding  and the redemption  of existing  funding 
gives  rise to  the liabilities  cash flow  (LCF).  To  determine  the LCF,  the entry  of new  funding  presents a 
positive  sign,  while  the  redemption  of existing  funding  assumes a negative  sign.  When  the entry of new 
funding  exceeds the  redemption  of  existing  funding,  LCF  is  positive,  meaning  financial  intermediatio n. 
Conversely,  when the redemption  of existing  funding  exceeds the entry of new funding,  the LCF assumes 
negative  values,  meaning  financial  disintermediation,  as shown below. 

 

LCF = entry of new funding  - redemption  of existing  funding 
LCF > 0, financial  intermediation 
LCF < 0, financial  disintermediation 

 

On the other hand, the credit cash flow (CCF) is  the net cash flow  produced by the proceedings 
of existing  loans  and the granting  of new loans. To determine  the CCF,  the proceedings  of existing  loans 
present a positive  sign,  while  the granting  of new loans  assume a negative sign.  When proceedings  exceed 
granting,  CCF  is  positive,  meaning  financial  disintermediation.  Conversely,  when  granting  exceeds 
proceedings,  CCF assumes negative values,  meaning  financial  intermediation,  as shown below.  

 

CCF = proceedings  of existing  loans - granting  of new loans 
CCF > 0, financial  disintermediation 
CCF < 0, financial  intermediation 

 

Because they  assume opposite  positions  in  the balance  sheet of  the financial  intermediaries, 
since  they  derive  from  assets  and  liabilities,  CCF  and  LCF  present  opposite  signs  for  financial 
intermediation  and financial  disintermediation,  as shown in  Fig. 1 below.

The  variables  CCF  and  LCF  are  calculated  following  the  same  procedure  adopted  in  the 
preparation  of  the  statement of  cash  flows  using  the  indirect  method.  The statement  of  cash flows  is  a 
mandatory  financial  statement for all  public  companies,  according  to IASB's 2 IAS 7 and FASB's3 (SFAS 
95). The rationale  used assumes that changes in the book  balance of any account between two subsequent 
periods  are the  result  of  accounting  events  (revenues  and  expenses) and  cash flow  events (cash flows), 
according  to equation  I below. 
 

𝐵𝑜𝑜𝑘 𝐵𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑡 − 𝐵𝑜𝑜𝑘 𝐵𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑡 −1 = +/− 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐸𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑡 +/− 𝐶𝑎𝑠ℎ 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝐸𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑡  

(I) 

 

Table  1 below  presents the  most  common  accounting  and  cash flow  events  used to calculate 

CCF and LCF.

After  removing  the  effects of  accounting  events  on  the  variation  of  the  book  balance,  the 
remaining  variation  corresponds to the effects of cash flow events (cash flows). Thus, by rewriting  equation 
I for CCF, the book balance is replaced with credit operations  (COp), accounting  events are replaced with 
revenues and expenses, and  cash flow events are replaced with credit proceedings  and credit granting: 
 

𝐶𝑂𝑝𝑡 − 𝐶𝑂𝑝𝑡 −1 =   𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡 −  𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑡 +   𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡  −   𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠𝑡 

(II) 

 

 

 

 

 

Rewriting  equation  II to isolate  the cash flow events: 

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠𝑡  −   𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡   =   − (𝐶𝑂𝑝𝑡 − 𝐶𝑂𝑝𝑡−1) + 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡 −  𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑡 

(III) 

Finally,  replacing  the cash flow events with  CCF in equation  III: 

𝐶𝐶𝐹𝑡  =   − (𝐶𝑂𝑝𝑡 − 𝐶𝑂𝑝𝑡−1) + 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡 −   𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑡 

(IV) 

Applying  the same procedure to LCF, the book balance in equation  I is replaced with liabilit ies, 
accounting  events  with  expenses and  cash flow  events with  entries  of new  funding  and redemptions  of 
existing  funding. 

 

𝐿𝐶𝐹𝑡   =   (𝐿𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠𝑡 − 𝐿𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠𝑡−1) −   𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑡 

(V)

The financial  intermediation  flow (FIF) 4 combines  the credit cash flow (CCF) and the liabilit ies 

cash flow  (LCF), as expressed in equation  VI:  

 

 

𝐹𝐼𝐹𝑡   =   (𝐿𝐶𝐹𝑡 − 𝐶𝐶𝐹𝑡 )/2 

(VI) 

As a result  of  the  rationale  adopted,  FIF may  assume  positive,  negative  or  zero  values.  The 
situations  in  which  LCF  exceeds CCF  form  the financial  intermediation  zone,  characterized  by  positive 
FIF.  Conversely,  the  cases  in  which  CCF  exceeds  LCF  form  the  financial  disintermedia tion  zone, 
characterized  by  negative  FIF.  When  LCF equals  CCF,  there is  a border,  a financial  non-intermediat ion 
frontier,  where there is neither financial  intermediation  nor financial  disintermediation.  Fig. 2 below shows 
the graphic  scheme of the financial  intermediation  model.

Fig.  3 shows the performance of financial  intermediation  in  Brazil,  from the perspective of the 
financial  intermediation  flow  (FIF), from December 2000  to December 2015.  These are aggregate data for 
the Brazilian  Financial  System (BFS) displayed  in a six-month  moving  average. The highlights  are events 
that significantly  affected financial  intermediation,  such as: (1) the period  of expansion  of the credit market 
as a result of macroeconomic  stability;  (2) the global  financial  crisis,  which  quickly  reversed the trend of 
expanding  financial  intermediation;  (3) the rapid  recovery  of the  crisis  with  the government  stimulus  to 
credit through  countercyclical  policies;  and (4) the fall  in  the GDP and the political  crisis  that culminated 
in the impeachment  of President Dilma  Roussef, and intense  financial  disintermediation. 

In  order  to  convert  the  FIF  measure  into  an  index  to  be  used  in  the  empirical  analysis,  we 
divided  it by the funding  balance  and created the financial  intermediation  index  (FI). The funding  balance 

                                                             
4 The division by two in equation VI avoids the double counting of the flow of resources in the financial intermediary, since the 
assumption of financial intermediation is that the funds raised from the surplus units are the same that will be granted to d eficit 
units. 

 

was used as the denominator  of the ratio because it  represents the conventional  channel through  which the 
resources subject  to financial  intermediation  are taken.

the crisis with the government stimulus to credit through countercyclical policies; and (4) the fall in the GDP and the political 
crisis  that culminated in the impeachment of President Dilma Roussef, and intense financial disintermediation  

 
 

3.2 Data 

After presenting  FI and NPL, this  section  describes the expected relationship  between FI and 

other variables that most studies take into  consideration  to explain  financial  intermediation5.   

Regarding  the baseline  model,  the credit portfolio  rate of growth  (CRED) captures the effects 
of  the  behavior  of  the  credit  portfolio  on  financial  intermediation,  in  accordance  with  Kasselaki  and 
Tagkalakis  (2013).  Krishnan and Largay (2000) and Cheng and Holie  (2005)  point  out the high  persistence 
in the behavior of cash flow-based variables,  which implies  that the present behavior of variables expressing 
financial  flows  is  not  independent  of  their  past behavior.  In  order  to  capture this  effect,  the one -period 
lagged  dependent variable  (FI) was added to the model. 

Thus, to evaluate the effects of credit risk (NPL) on financial  intermediation  (FI), the following 

general specification  was used. 
 

𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑁𝑃𝐿𝑖,𝑡 , 𝐶𝑅𝐸𝐷𝑖,𝑡 , 𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡−1 ,𝑍𝑖,𝑡), 

(1) 

 
where  Z  covers  mostly  financial  institutions’  individual  characteristics  and  other  stimuli  to  financial 
intermediation  and sub-index  i refers to financial  institutions  and t to the time  periods. 

In order to investigate  the impact  of financial  frictions  on  financial  intermediation,  panel  data 
models  are used. The sample consists of 6161  observations  extracted from the balance sheets of 101 banks 
for the period  from  December 2000  to December 2015  (61 quarters). Such information  is made available 
from the CBB through  the IF.data system (Selected Information  on Supervised  Institutions).  The analysis 
ponders well-accepted variables  observed in the literature on financial  intermediation.  As most studies take 
into  account the influence  of the interest  rate, liquidity  and size in  the analysis  of financial  intermediation 
we included  the following  variables  in the empirical  model: 

                                                             
.  5 See Table A1 (appendix) for sources of data and description of the variables.  

 

-  IR  (monetary  policy  interest  rate)  -  It  is  expected  that  monetary  policy 
influences  on  financial 
intermediation  through  the risk-taking  channel,  that is,  changes in  monetary  policy  rates affect either  risk 
perceptions  or risk-tolerance  (Gambacorta,  2009;  Borio  and Zhu,  2012).  The monetary policy  interest rate 
in  Brazil  is the Selic  interest rate (IR). Following  Tabak,  Laiz and Cajueiro  (2013),  we included  the Selic 
rate in  the model,  to evaluate the effect of monetary  policy  on financial  intermediation  and consequently 
the relationship  between monetary  policy  and financial  stability.   
-  SIZE  -  the  natural  logarithm  of  the  total  assets  was used  as  a  proxy  for  size.  The  size  of  financial 
intermediaries  eases access to funding.  As a consequence, larger banks are expected to be more capable of 
engaging  in financial  intermediation  (Bhagat, Bolton  and Lu, 2015). 
- LIQ (Liquidity) - the variable  used to evaluate  the effects of liquidity  on financial  intermediation  is  the 
ratio  of  liquid  assets to  total  assets. The  classical  theories  of  microeconomics  of  banking  support  the 
understanding  that liquidity  risk  and financial  intermediation  are closely  linked  (Bryant,  1980;  Diamond 
and  Dybvig,  1983).  Thereby,  keeping  a high  proportion  of liquid  assets is  compatible  with  a lower  risk 
appetite and, therefore, with lower financial  intermediation  (Berrospide,  2013). 

As  pointed  out  by  Gadanecz  and  Jayaram  (2009),  many  emerging  markets’  banks  rely  on 
external funding  to support their lending  activities,  being then important  to track the influence  of the foreign 
sector on domestic financial  intermediation.  Additionally,  the financial  intermediation  activity  is subject to 
prociclicality.  A  booming  economy  leads  to  a  reduction  in  non-performing  loans  and  spurs  financial 
intermediation.  On  the  other  hand,  a  depressed economy  can hinder  financial  intermediation.  Hence to 
address the effects of the foreign  sector and economic  activity  on financial  intermediation,  we included  the 
following  variables  in the empirical  model: 
- USD - the rate of growth of the US Dollar  – Brazilian  Real exchange rate captures the effect of the foreign 
sector on financial  intermediation.  A devaluation  of the domestic  currency can harm companies  that resort 
to foreign  currency to fund their  activities,  leading  to a reduction  in  financial  intermediation. 
- OGAP – this indicator  was built  from the series of GDP accumulated in 12 months,  provided  by the CBB. 
The output  gap is  obtained  by  the difference between the GDP series and its  long-term  trend  (Hamilton, 
2017).  Variations  in  the  economic  cycle  are  expected  to  affect  the  financial  intermediation  activity 
positively.   

Data is gathered from Central Bank of Brazil  (financial  analysis  report) regarding  information 
of 101  banks  from  December 2000  to December 2015  with  quarterly  frequency  (Table  A2 – appendix  – 
presents the descriptive  statistics).   

 

3.3 Methodology 

Based  on  the  variables  described  above,  we  consider  a  baseline  model  and  six  additional 
variations  to observe a possible  effect caused by credit risk on financial  intermediation.  The baseline  model, 
which is given  by  
 

𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑁𝑃𝐿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽2𝐶𝑅𝐸𝐷𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽3𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡

Where the subscript  i = 1, 2,  . . .,  101 is the financial  institution;  t = 1, 2, . . ., 61 is the period, 

and ε

i,t is the disturbance.   

The next  six  models  include  the  variables  IR,  LIQ, SIZE,  USD and OGAP  individually  and 

collectively  (𝛺i,t , 𝜑i,t , 𝜓i,t,, 𝜃i,t , 𝛷i,t , 𝜐i,t are the disturbances). As a consequence: 
 

𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽4 + 𝛽5𝑁𝑃𝐿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽6𝐶𝑅𝐸𝐷𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽7𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡−1+𝛽8𝐼𝑅𝑡 + 𝛺𝑖,𝑡

Considering  that financial  intermediation  may also influence  credit risk,  the risk of simultaneity 
problem  in  the  analysis  and  consequently  the  possibility  of  endogeneity  in  the  regressions  must  be 
addressed. To account for that, this study does not limit  the analysis to the usual OLS methods found  in the 
literature,  making  use of  dynamic  panel  data analysis  (D-GMM  and S-GMM).  Resorting  to instrumental 
variables  and lagged dependent variables lead to the estimation  of parameters more consistently,  even when 
endogeneity  is present in explanatory  variables  (Bond,  Hoeffler and Temple,  2001).   

Blundell  and  Bond  (1998)  argue that  first-difference  GMM  presents a bias  and low  accuracy 
and Arellano  and Bover (1995)  agree that the use of lagged  levels can generate weak instruments.  To deal 
with  that, we used  S-GMM  to improve  the efficiency  of the analysis  by mitigating  the weakness problem 
in  the  D-GMM.  It’s worth  noting  that  we reported  analysis  making  use  of  all  methods  to  the  extent  of 
stressing  our hypothesis  that NPL affects financial  intermediation  . 

Finally,  in order to confirm  the validity  of the estimations  reported, the test of over-identifying 
restrictions  (J-test) was used as suggested  by  Arellano  (2003)  and tests of first-order  (AR1) and  second-
order (AR2) serial  correlation  were carried out.  

 

4. Results 

With  the  purpose  of  observing  the  relationship  between  the  variables  used  in  the  model 
concerning  financial  intermediation  (FI) and credit risk (NPL), the correlation  matrix  is presented in Table 
A3 (see appendix).  In particular,  it is worth noting  that the correlation  between the credit risk measure and 
the financial  intermediation  measure indicates  opposite  behavior.  In other words,  the negative  correlation 
found between NPL and FI suggests that an increase in the credit risk leads banks to a conservative behavior 
and reduces financial  intermediation. 

We  present  empirical  results  in  Tables  2  and  3.  In  a general  way,  the  signs  and  statistical 
significance  obtained  for credit  risk  remain  unchanged  in  all  models.  In  addition,  all  GMM  regressions 
accepted  the  null  hypothesis  in  the  Sargan  tests  (J  statistic),  which  means  that  the  overidentification 
constraints are valid.  Finally,  the serial autocorrelation  tests (AR (1) and AR (2)) rejected the hypothesis  of 
serial autocorrelation. 

The negative  sign  and statistical  significance  in  all  models  indicate  that an increase in  credit 
risk  reduces financial  intermediation.  This  result suggests that deterioration  of the credit risk  scenario and 
the consequent increase in  non-performing  loans  reduce the process of financial  intermediation  and work 
as a financial  friction.  An increase in  the financial  friction  of the  intermediation  activity  can be explained 
by  the  banks'  forward-looking  behavior  in  view  of  deterioration  in  the  credit  scenario.  In  addition,  the 
contraction  of  financial  intermediation  can result  in  a  liquidity  hoarding  that  leads  to  a  financial  crisis 
(Cornett et al., 2011). 

Regarding  the credit  portfolio  behavior,  financial  intermediation  is intensified  in  the presence 
of positive  changes in the credit portfolio.  This result is expected since an increase in credit granting  reflects 
bank's engagement in  financial  intermediation  activity  through  the risk-taking  channel  (Foos,  Norden and 
Weber, 2010). 

As  for  the  one-period  lagged  financial  intermediation,  the  positive  sign  and  the  statistical 
significance  reflect the persistence of the financial  intermediation  activity.  The decision  to  engage in  the 
credit  market is  a strategic one,  which  is materialized  by  the financial  intermediation  activity.  The result 
agrees  with  Cheng  and  Hollie  (2005)  who  argue  that  the  persistence  of  cash  flows  depends  on  the 
persistence of the activities  from which they result. 

The observed result for the FI reaction to monetary policy  is consistent with the broad literature 

 

on the subject.  The negative  sign  and the significance  of the IR coefficients  suggest that the adoption  of a 
more  restrictive  monetary  policy,  which  implies  an increase  in  the basic  interest  rate,  reduces financial 
intermediation.  The implications  of this  result  reinforce  the arguments  of Poloz  (2015)  and Osiński,  Seal 
and Hoogduin  (2013)  on the need to articulate  monetary policy  and financial  stability. 

In a general  way, the relationship  between liquidity  and financial  intermediation  presents the 
expected  sign.  Entities  with  a  lower  proportion  of  liquid  assets  engage  more  intensely  in  financial 
intermediation.  The result agrees with De Haan and Van den End (2013) who conclude that, in the presence 
of  a deposit-taking  shock,  banks  react by  reducing  the  origination  of  new loans,  which  is  equivalent  to 
reducing  financial  intermediation,  and increasing  liquid  assets. 

The positive  and significant  sign  for the relationship  between the size of financial  institutio ns 
(SIZE) and financial  intermediation  is expected and compatible  with the easier access to funding  that larger 
entities  enjoy. 

The  influence  of  the  foreign  sector  on  the  financial  intermediation  activity,  captured  by  the 
variable USD, presents the expected sign and significance.  The devaluation  of the domestic currency harms 
financial  intermediation  for it  makes it  difficult  for banks  to access external  funding  as well  as increases 
the indebtedness  of those companies  that rely on foreign  funding. 

Moreover,  the  influence  of  the  economic  activity  on  financial  intermediation  presents  the 
expected  sign  and  significance.  The  economic  cycle  affects financial  intermediation  positively  once  a 
booming  economy  leads to a wider output  gap and intensifies  financial  intermediation.

The results of the analysis indicate that the worsening  in the expectations associated 
with the credit market, as evidenced by the non-performing  loans (NPL), induce banks to reduce 
the process of financial  intermediation.  Hence, a segmented analysis  of the sample,  in order to 
isolate  the  global  financial  crisis,  allows  one  to  assess whether  the  effect of  credit  risk  on 
financial  intermediation  remains  unchanged during  periods  of different risk aversion. 

In  order to  conduct  this  investigation,  the  sample  was segmented  into  three non -
overlapping  periods:  pre-crisis,  crisis  and post-crisis.  In agreement with  Antunes,  De Moraes 
and Montes (2016),  the crisis  period  ranges from October 2008  to December 2010,  delimit in g 
the pre-crisis  period  from  December 2000  to September  2008  and  the post-crisis  period  from 
January 2011  to December 2015. 

The  analysis  adopts  the  same  specifications  used  previously.  The  results  are 
presented  in  Table  3 and  indicate  that there are no  problems  of  overidentification  and  serial 
autocorrelation  in  the models  (observe  the statistics  J,  AR (1) and  AR (2)).  Considering  the 
relevance of the System Generalized  Method  of Moments  (S-GMM)  for this  kind  of analysis, 
the results  were limited  to this method. 

The  results  of  the  estimation  for  the  pre- and  post-crisis  periods  are similar  and 
agree broadly  with  those obtained  in the previous  analysis.  These results are expected because 
the pre- and post-crisis  periods  represent the largest  subsamples  and are characterized  by  the 
predominance  of  low  risk  aversion.  Therefore  it  is  not  surprising  that  they  corroborate  the 
behavior  of the whole period. 

Crises  periods  can  evolve  into  financial  contagion  and  involve  the  break  of 
correlations,  according  to  Kenourgios,  Samitas  and  Paltadilis  (2011).  Such  events  are 
characterized  by  extreme  risk  aversion,  which  leads  to  a  rapid  change  in  the  behavior  of 
correlations.  As a  consequence,  the  crisis  period  is  expected  to  behave  differently  from  the 
others.

intermediation  and the variables  CRED, LIQ, FI(-1) and OGAP maintain  the expected sign,  but 
lose significance  in the crisis period,  revealing  the loss of explanatory  power of these variables. 
The  relationships  between  financial  intermediation  and  IR,  SIZE  and  USD  maintain  the 
expected  sign,  but  partially  lose  significance,  keeping  it  just  in  the  individual  specification. 
These  results  indicate  that  even  in  periods  of  high  risk  aversion,  the  behavior  of  financial 
intermediation  remains  somewhat  sensitive  to  monetary  policy,  the  size  of  banks  and  the 
foreign  sector. 

In particular,  the relationship  between financial  intermediation  and NPL holds even 
in  a period  of exacerbation  of risk  aversion  and change of correlations.  Indeed, for  the models 
1a to 1c the magnitude  of the NPL coefficients  in the crisis  period  increases sharply in  relation 
to  the  pre-  and  post-crisis  periods,  corroborating  the  expected  amplification  of  financial 
frictions  during  crisis.  This  result  highlights  the  strength  of  the  relationship  between  these 
variables,  as  well  as  the  importance  of  monitoring  the  financial  intermediation  measure 
developed  in  this study as an additional  financial  stability  management instrument. 

 

5. Robustness analysis  

The  confirmatory  analysis  of  the  results  excludes  state-owned  banks  from  the 
sample.  After removing  the 13 state-owned banks,  the sample  is reduced to the  remaining  88 
private  banks.  The  same  specifications  and  methodology  of  the  analysis  performed  in  the 
previous  section  are used and the results are presented in Table 4. 

The  results  obtained  in  the  analysis  corroborate  those  presented  in  the  previous 
section.  The  relationships  between  financial  intermediation  and  the  explanatory  variables 
present  the  same  signs  and  significance.  In  particular,  the  relationship  between  financial 
intermediation  and credit risk is negative and significant  when restricting  the analysis to private -
owned banks. Therefore, the removal  of state-owned banks does not affect the analysis. 

 

6. Conclusions 

This  paper investigates  the effect of financial  frictions  on financial  intermediatio n. 
Hence, we develop  a measure of financial  intermediation,  which  captures the financial  flows 
involved  in  the intermediation  process, and empirically  test the effect of non-performing  loans 
(NPL)  on  the  behavior  of  financial  intermediation  (FI)  performed  by  banks.  Through  the 
estimation  of a dynamic  panel of 101 Brazilian  banks from December 2000  to December 2015, 
there  is  evidence  of  significant  effects  between  non-performing 
loans  and  financial 
intermediation.  Thus,  the worsening  of the credit risk  scenario and the consequent  increase in 
credit  defaults  induce  the  financial  system  to  reduce  the  financial  intermediation  activity. 
Moreover,  we identify  a relationship  between monetary  policy  and financial  intermediation.  A 
tight  monetary policy  reduces financial  intermediation  while  a loose monetary policy  amplifies 
it. 

The results of this study suggest a novel  variable,  the financial  intermediation  flow 
(FIF),  as well  as the financial  intermediation  index  (FI),  as measures capable of  revealing  the 
behavior  of financial  intermediation.  In particular,  the effect of the financial  friction  caused by 
non-performing  loans  on the financial  intermediation  was captured under different  time frames 
and risk aversion scenarios. Therefore, such measures can be used as additional  instruments  for 
the management of financial  stability. 

 

 

Note 1: M stands for Model; FI stands for financial intermediation and is the ratio of the financial intermediation flow and the funding balance; NPL is the ratio between the non-performing 
loans and the credit portfolio; CRED is the growth rate of the credit portfolio; IR is the basic interest rate (Selic); LIQ is the ratio between liquid assets and total assets; SIZE is the log of 
total assets; USD is the growth rate of the US Dollar – Brazilian Real exchange rate; and OGAP is the difference between the GDP series and its long-term trend, according to Hamilton 
(2017). 
Note 2: Marginal significance levels: (***) denotes 0.01, (**) denotes 0.05, and (*) denotes 0.1. White’s heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix was applied in regressions. Standard 
errors between parentheses. FOLS – OLS fixed effects. D-GMM – uses two-step of Arellano and Bond (1991) without time period effects. S-GMM – uses two-step of Arellano and Bover 
(1995) without time period effects. D-GMM estimator – tests for AR (1) and AR (2) check that the average autocovariance in first order and second-order residuals, respectively, is zero. S-
GMM estimator – tests for AR (1) and AR (2) check for the presence of first order and second-order serial correlation in the first-difference residuals. The sample is an unbalanced panel of 
101 financial institutions from December 2000 to December 2015.
