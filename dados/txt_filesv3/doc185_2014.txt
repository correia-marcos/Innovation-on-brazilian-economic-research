Abstract  -  This  paper  investigates  the  impacts  of  several  alternative  climate  change  policy  scenarios  for 
Brazil  and  Mexico.  The  goal  is  to  compare  the  options  for  GHG  reductions  in  Brazil  and  Mexico  and  to 
explore the similarities and differences in the potential approach to climate change mitigation between these 
two countries, in order to asses if a global “one-fits-all” policy can be justified or the countries should focus 
on their own strategies for emission mitigation. We use the MIT Emission Prediction and Policy Analysis 
(EPPA)  model,  a  global  energy-economic  computable  general  equilibrium  model.  The  scenarios  consider 
broad classical instruments in reducing GHG emissions and pollutants, as tax and cap and trade systems, as 
also  alternative  climate  change  policies  under  discussion.  We  demonstrate  that  Mexico’s  and  Brazil’s 
commitments for 2020, made during the UN climate meetings in Copenhagen and Cancun, while reachable 
come at very different costs for both countries. The comparative analysis of these two big Latin American 
economies  underscore  the  need  to  design  climate  policy  that  considers  the  specific  characteristics  of  each 
country,  including  the  natural  resources  available  as  well  as  their  current  economic  structure.  Also,  our 
results  suggest  that  there  are  other  environmental  and  economic  consequences  for  Brazil  and  Mexico  of 
stringent climate policies at the global scale, such as the uncertainties in the value of energy resources traded 
in international markets.

Resumo - O presente estudo investiga os impactos de diversas alternativas de políticas de mudança do clima 
para o Brasil e o México. O objetivo é comparar as opções para reduzir emissões de GGEs nesses países e 
explorar as similaridades e diferenças em potenciais estratégias de mitigação de mudanças climáticas entre 
eles,  de  forma  a  identificar  se  um  política  única  global  seria  adequada,  ou  se  cada  país  deve  focar  na  sua 
própia estratégia de mitigação. Para tal, utiliza-se o modelo MIT Emission Prediction and Policy Analysis 
(EPPA),  um  modelo  computável  de  equilíbrio  geral  de  representação  global  dos  sistemas  econômicos  e 
energéticos.  Os  cenários  consideram  instrumentos  clássicos  amplos  de  redução  de  emissões  de  GGEs  e 
poluentes, como impostos e mercados de permissões de emissões, além de políticas de mudança do clima em 
discussão.  Os  resultados  demonstram  que  os  compromissos  assumidos  por  México  e  Brasil  durante  os 
encontros da ONU em Copenhague e Cancun são atingíveis a custos bem diferentes entre esses países. Uma 
análise comparativa entre essas duas maiores economias da América Latina revela a necessidade de desenhar 
políticas climáticas que  consideram  as características particulares de  cada país, incluindo seus estoques de 
recursos  naturais  disponíveis  assim  como  suas  estruturas  econômicas  atuais.  Os  resultados  ainda  sugerem 
outras  consequências  ambientais  e  econômicas  para  Brasil  e  Mexico  advindas  de  políticas  climáticas  mais 
restritivas,  como  as  incertezas  na  valoração  dos  seus  recursos  energéticos  negociados  nos  mercados 
internacionais.

1. Introduction 

In the context of climate change mitigation policy, current debate hinges on the future role that big 
developing  countries  will  play  in  long-term  agreements  to  mitigate  the  climate  risk.  In  the  case  of  Latin 
America, Brazil and Mexico being the biggest economies in the  region  play  a  central role. Both countries 
have  actively  participated  in  the  international  efforts  under  the  UN  Framework  Convention  on  Climate 
Change, as well as in other policy forums such as the G8+5 Climate Change Dialogue. In 2012 with a GDP 
of $2.25 and $1.18 trillion US dollars respectively, Brazil and Mexico account for 62 per cent of all of Latin 
America’s economy  (WB, 2014). The population of these two countries is 55 percent of the region, 200.4 
million  people  in  Brazil  and  120.8  million  people  in  Mexico  (UN,  2013).  Both  upper  middle  income 
countries,  Brazil  and  Mexico  have  higher  income  per  capita,  $11,690  and  $9,940  US  dollars  respectively, 
than the average in Latin America of $9,314 US dollars (WB, 2014). Thus, both countries have been under 
significant international pressure to enhance mitigation action. 

Regarding  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  in  2005  Brazil  and  Mexico  emitted  2,032  and  667 
million  tons  of  CO2e  respectively  (MME  and  EPE,  2013)  (SEMARNAT,  2013).  These  figures  include 
emissions from fossil fuel use, other industrial emissions and land use change. In 2010, Mexico’s emissions 
were 748 million tons of CO2e, an increase of 12% in five years. In contrast, Brazil’s emissions experienced 
a significant reduction of 39% in the same period, with total emissions in 2010 of 1,246 million ton CO2e. 
The  reduction  of  Brazil’s  emissions  comes  as  a  result  of  deforestation  control  policy.  While  total  CO2 
emissions  in  Brazil  from  land  use  experienced  a  sharp  drop,  industrial  and  agriculture  emissions  kept  an 
upward trend. In 2010, Mexico’s per capita emissions from fossil fuels were 3.8 ton CO2, while Brazil’s per 
capita emission were 2.2 ton CO2. However, if we account for total emissions including land use change and 
non-CO2 GHG, per capita emissions of Brazil were 6.8 ton of CO2e and Mexico’s 6.1 ton of CO2e. 

The  goal  of  this  paper  is  to  compare  the  options  for  GHG  reductions  in  Brazil  and  Mexico  and  to 
explore the similarities and differences in the potential approach to climate change mitigation between these 
two countries. We seek to understand if a global “one-fits-all” policy like the same carbon price or similar 
percent  reduction  in  emissions  can  be  justified  or  the  countries  should  focus  on  their  own  strategies  for 
emission mitigation. We use the MIT Emission Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model (Paltsev et al., 
2005), which is a global energy-economic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, developed at MIT 
Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. The scenarios considered here are developed to 
consider alternative climate change policies under discussion. 

In this paper, we focus on the dynamics of emissions trends, the resulting energy choices and explain 
the macroe- conomic costs in climate policy scenarios. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes 
the EPPA model. Section 3 provides an overview of the reference scenario, focusing on emissions, energy 
and electricity mix in the business as usual case. This section describes some of the key diferences in energy 
structures to understand policy costs in Brazil and Mexico. Section 4 presents the results of several climate 
policy scenarios. Section 5 concludes. 

 

2. The MIT Emissions Predictions and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model 

The  EPPA  model  (Table  1)  is  a  multi-region,  multi-sector  recursive  dynamic  representation  of  the 
global economy (Paltsev et al., 2005). The GTAP data set provides the base information on the input-output 
structure for regional economies, including bilateral trade flows (Hertel, 1997; Dimaranan and McDougall, 
2002). We aggregate the data into 16 regions and 21 sectors. 

Table 1 presents the countries or regions represented in the model and broadly identifies final demand 
sectors and energy supply and conversion sectors. Final demand sectors include five industrial sectors and 
two household demands, transportation and other household activities (space conditioning, lighting, etc.), as 
shown in the table.

Energy  supply  and  conversion  sectors  are  modeled  insufficient  detail  to  identify  fuels  and 
technologies with different CO2 emissions and to represent both fossil and non-fossil advanced technologies. 
There  are  16  geographical  regions  represented  explicitly  in  the  model  including  major  countries  (Brazil, 
Mexico, U.S., Japan, Canada, China, India, Russia) and 10 regions that are aggregations of countries, among 
them  the  Latin  American  region,  which  in  EPPA  represents  the  rest  of  Latin  America  without  Brazil  and 
Mexico. In this paper we focus on the results for two countries: Brazil and Mexico. 

The synthetic coal gas industry produces a perfect substitute for natural gas. The oil shale industry 
produces  a  perfect  substitute  for  refined  oil.  All  electricity  generation  technologies  produce  perfectly 
substitutable  electricity  except  for  renewable  energy  technologies,  which  have  a  special  treatment  in  the 
model. For wind and solar technologies we represent two types of penetration, at low levels of penetration a 
generic Wind and Solar technology is modeled as producing an imperfect substitute of electricity, reflecting 
its diurnal and seasonal variability and intermittency. At large-scale penetration, we allow wind and solar to 
enter  as  perfect  substitutes,  but  require  a  back-up  generating  unit  either  from  natural  gas  or  biomass.  We 
introduce these “hybrid” technologies considering that wind and solar technologies could penetrate the mix if 
they  become  competitive  under  climate  policy,  but  will  require  additional  capacity  to  overcome  its 
intermittency issues. For more details on this formulation see Morris et al. (2010). Biomass use is included 
both in electric generation and in transport where a liquid fuel is produced that is assumed to be a perfect 
substitute for refined oil. 

Regarding land use we explicitly model land conversion to different economic uses. Each land type is 
a renewable resource whose quantities can be altered through conversion to another type or abandonment to a 
non-use  category.  In  the  general  equilibrium  framework,  we  need  to  keep  both  consistencies  with  the 
physical  units  and  with  the  economic  value.  The  first  of  these  conditions  is  achieved  by  assuming  that  1 

2 

 

hectare of land of one type is converted to 1 hectare of another type, and through conversion it takes on the 
productivity level of the average for that type for that region, either cropland, pastureland or managed forest. 
The second of these conditions is achieved by observing that in equilibrium the marginal conversion cost of 
land  from  one  type  to  another  should  be  equal  to  the  difference  in  value  of  the  types.  We  require  that 
conversion uses real inputs through a land transformation function (Gurgel et al., 2007). 

The model includes representation of abatement of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions (CH4, N2O, 
HFCs, PFCs and SF6) and the calculations consider both the emissions mitigation that occurs as a byproduct 
of  actions  directed  at  CO2  and  reductions  resulting  from  gas-specific  control  measures.  Targeted  control 
measures include reductions in the emissions of: CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels and land use; the 
industrial gases that replace CFCs controlled by the Montreal Protocol and produced at aluminum smelters; 
CH4 from fossil energy  production and use, agriculture, and waste, and N2O from fossil fuel combustion, 
chemical  production  and  improved  fertilizer  use.  More  detail  on  how  abatement  costs  are  represented  for 
these substances is provided in (Hyman et al., 2003). 

Future  scenarios  are  driven  by  economic  growth  that  results  from  savings  and  investments  and 
exogenously spec- ified productivity improvement in labor, energy, and land. Growth in demand for goods 
produced from each sector including food and fuels occurs as GDP and income grow. Stocks of depletable 
resources  (like  coal,  oil  and  natural  gas)  fall  as  they  are  used,  driving  production  to  higher  cost  grades. 
Sectors  that  use  renewable  resources  such  as  land  compete  for  the  available  flow  of  services  from  them, 
generating rents. These together with policies, such as constraints on the amount of greenhouse gases, change 
the  relative  economics  of  different  technologies  over  time  and  across  scenarios.  The  timing  of  entry  of 
advanced technologies, such as cellulosic bio-oil or wind and solar technologies, is endogenous when they 
become cost competitive with existing technologies. 

When emissions constraints on certain countries, gases, or sectors are imposed in a CGE model such 
as EPPA, the model calculates a shadow value of the constraint which is interpretable as a price that would 
be obtained under an allowance market that developed under a cap and trade system. The solution algorithm 
of the EPPA model finds least- cost reductions for each gas in each sector and if emissions trading is allowed 
it equilibrates the prices among sectors and gases (using GWP weights). This set of conditions, often referred 
to as what and where flexibility, will tend to lead to least-cost abatement. Without these conditions abatement 
costs  will  vary  among  sources  and  that  will  impact  the  estimated  welfare  cost,  because  abatement  will  be 
least-cost within a sector or region or for a specific gas, but will not be equilibrated among them. In these 
scenarios, no emissions trading between countries was allowed, since international trading in GHG gases still 
an political and institutional challenge worldwide. 

For this study, we have improved the EPPA model in the following way. Flex-fuel vehicles for Brazil 
are included, allowing for the substitution between gasoline-ethanol blend and pure ethanol. Also, to reflect 
current fleet trends in Brazil (in 2012 the share of flex fuel cars was 58%), we increase the share of flex fuel 
vehicles  (it  starts  as  30%  of  the  fleet  in  2005  and  grows  to  95%  of  the  fleet  by  2065,  staying  constant 
thereafter). We also included bioelectricity production from sugarcane bagasse, which was calibrated for a 
total generation of 0.07 EJ in 2010. We parameterized the model so that this type of energy represents around 
3 to 4 % of the power mix in our reference scenario. We also updated population trends based in UN data 
(UN, 2013), as well as GDP growth and the electricity sector fuel use for Brazil and Mexico up till 2010 data. 
In term of emissions, for Brazil EPPA estimates in 2005 a total of 2208 million tons compared to 2,032 of the 
national emissions inventory. Given the high reduction of emissions from deforestation, we adjusted EPPA 
trends to match the inventory data for deforestation in 2010. With this adjustment, EPPA CO2e emissions for 
Brazil in 2010 for Brazil are 1,210 million, compared to 1,246 million tons of CO2e reported in the National 
Emissions Inventory of Brazil, 3% higher. In the case of Mexico, 2005 EPPA emissions for Mexico are 710 
million  CO2e  compared  to  667  million  ton  of  CO2e  reported  in  Mexico’s  national  inventory,  6%  higher. 
These small deviations result from slightly higher emissions in the energy sector in Mexico and Brazil, and 

3 

 

also higher N2O emissions, in the case of Mexico. The next section present the reference, or “business as 
usual”, scenario projected in EPPA assuming no climate policies in Brazil or Mexico, besides those already 
implemented in 2010 or before. Further details about EPPA may be found in Paltsev et al. (2005) and Gurgel 
and Paltsev (2014). 

 

3. Overview of the Reference Scenario 

This  section  presents  an  overview  of  the  EPPA  model  estimates  for  the  emissions  trajectories  of 
Brazil and Mexico during this century. In the Reference scenario we assume no explicit climate policy. As 
we  discuss  later,  the  costs  of  climate  policy  and  emissions  abatement  potential  of  the  two  countries  are 
related to their current energy mix and natural resources. With vast hydropower resources and productive and 
large  land  area,  Brazil  relies  on  hydropower  for  electricity  and  has  developed  its  bio-energy  sector.  In 
addition to having vast resources, Brazil experienced high energy prices during the oil shock in the 70’s, a 
situation  that  triggered  policy  to  diversify  its  energy  mix  and  reduce  foreign  oil  dependence.  In  contrast, 
Mexico, endowed with substantial oil resources, developed a significant petroleum industry and positioned 
itself as an important oil exporting country. While Mexico’s renewable energy resources are abundant, the 
availability of low-cost oil resulted in fossil energy as a preferred choice in the country. Thus, as a result of 
both  resource  availability  and  energy  policies,  Mexico’s  primary  energy  comes  98%  from  fossil  fuels 
sources, contrasting with 62% in the Brazilian energy mix. 

This starting position results in a very diferent initial breakdown of these two economies’ emissions. 
Figure 1 shows the reference emissions by sector for the two countries. As shown, energy related emissions 
are much higher in Mexico than in Brazil (35% vs 21%), but land-use emissions are higher in Brazil (36% vs 
12%). The industrial and transportation sectors contribute with similar share of emissions in both countries 
(around 20% and 18%, respectively). A big difference between the two countries is also the participation of 
the residential and commercial sector in emissions, being 13% in Mexico and only 2% in Brazil.

Our results for the Reference projection of primary energy in both countries are shown in Figure 2 for 
Brazil and Mexico. Currently, Brazil has a substantial contribution from hydro energy, but since development 
of hydropower is limited by total resource availability, other energy sources start growing at a faster pace. By 
the end of the century, EPPA model results show that Brazil will increase significantly its use of natural gas, 
oil  and  biomass.  Nuclear  energy  is  not  projected  to  increase  its  share.  In  the  case  of  Mexico,  natural  gas 
increases  its  participation  significantly  and  oil  use  also  grows.  In  the  reference  scenario,  without  further 
policy,  no  other  energy  sources  seem  to  increase  its  participation  in  Mexico.  In  the  Reference  scenario, 
without  further  energy  or  climate  policy,  Mexico  is  projected  to  rely  on  oil  and  natural  gas  for  its  energy

Brazil has a cleaner electricity mix than Mexico with 70% of its power in 2010 coming from hydro 
energy, followed by natural gas (11%), oil (9%), and coal (5%). In contrast, Mexico’s power mix in 2010 
was heavily dominated by fossil fuels: natural gas (42%) and oil (24%) and coal (10%). Figure 3 shows our 
projections  for  electricity  mix  up  to  2050.  Brazil  continues  to  rely  on  hydro  power  and  also  expands  its 
natural gas based generation. Mexico’s growth in electricity is based on expansion of natural gas.

3.2. Final Energy Use: Industry, Transportation and Residential and Commercial 

Final energy use grows in all sectors of the economy in Brazil and Mexico, as shown in Figure 4. In 
Brazil  most  of  the  growth  is  expected  in  industry  and  transportation,  while  in  Mexico  residential  and 
commercial  use  is  expected  to  grow  faster.  This  result  is  based  on  relative  shares  of  the  sectors,  their 
competitiveness and improvements in energy efficiency. 

 

3.3. Emissions trends 

The  resulting  emissions  trends  for  Brazil  and  Mexico  are  shown  in  Figure  5.  First,  one  important 
policy was included in the baseline that shift emissions from 2005 level downwards in Brazil. Considering 
the drastic drop in emissions from deforestation in Brazil, which have in the last 5 years decrease 80%, we 
impose  a  policy  constraint  on  land  use  emissions  to  reflect  this  command  and  control  regulation.

Interestingly, in terms of CO2 emissions by the end of the model period, both countries emissions trajectory 
almost end at the same level. However, regarding non-CO2 gases, Brazil emits 3.5 times as much as Mexico 
of methane and twice as much nitrous oxide, a difference that is maintain in the case of methane throughout 
the period and increases in the case of nitrous oxide. Figure 6 splits the total contribution of CO2 emissions 
from combustion processes from those of land use change, an important distinction for mitigation strategies.

4. Policy Scenarios 

 

 
In order to project the costs and consequences of common alternative climate policies on the Brazilian 
and  Mexican  economies,  we  modeled  seven  alternative  policy  scenarios:  1)  the  Copenhagen  climate 
mitigation  pledges  (scenario  1b),  2)  a  carbon  tax  of  10  dollars  per  ton  of  CO2e  starting  in  2020,  and 
increasing by 4% each year (scenario 2a), 3) a carbon tax of 50 dollars per ton of CO2e starting in 2020 and 
increasing by 4% each year (scenario 2c), 4) a cap on total CO2e emissions reducing from 2010 levels a 5% 
in 2010, a 10% in 2030, a 15% in 2040 and 20% on 2050 and onwards (scenario 2d), 5) a more stringent cap 
on total CO2e emissions reducing from 2010 levels a 12.5% in 2020, a 25% in 2030, a 37.5% in 2040, and 
50% in 2050 and onwards (scenario 2e), 6) a cap on CO2 emissions only following the same reductions of 
scenario 2d (scenario 2f), and 7) a cap on CO2 emissions only following the same reductions of scenario of 
2d and 2e (scenario 2f and 2g) (See Table 2).

The  first  policy  scenario  (1b)  considers  only  those  policies  assumed  by  countries  during  the 
Copenhagen COP meeting in 2009. Scenarios 2a and 2c assumes the imposition of a CO2 tax (price) on all 
GHG  emissions  starting  at  $10  and  $50  per  ton  of  CO2  equivalent,  respectively.  Scenarios  2d  and  2e 
considers cap-and-trade policies able to reduce emissions from 5% and 10% to 20% and 50% respectively by 
2050, imposed as national level policies in all sectors at same time, excluding land use changes emissions, 
7 

 

 

with  trade  of  CO2  permits  among  sectors  and  GHG  gases  (using  GWP  equivalents).  The  choice  of  these 
policy scenarios aims to consider broad and general policies discussed by the environmental economics as 
able to promote efficiency and effectiveness. At same time, they allow to verify how the same policy set up 
would affect two developing countries with different energy matrixes and emissions profile.   

These last two scenarios were specified to verify how the outcome of the policies would differ if only 
CO2  emissions  were  targeted  in  the  policies.  For  the  Copenhagen  pledges,  we  consider  the  voluntary 
commitments to reduce emissions by 2020 in 36 to 39% for Brazil from its business as usual level and 30% 
for Mexico from its business as usual. Brazil projected business as usual emissions of 2,703 million tons of 
CO2e  by  2020;  the  Copenhagen  commitments  were  to  reduce  them  between  975  and  1,052  million  tons, 
which means that in 2020 Brazil could have emissions around 1,652 or 1,728 million tons of CO2e. Given 
that Brazil’s emissions in 2010 were already below the target, the Copenhagen goal is already met. In our 
modeling, we only impose a small requirement for the industry to reduce emissions in 6%, considering the 
breakdown  that  Brazil  proposed  for  sectoral  emissions  reduction,  which  resulted  in  an  almost  negligible 
policy cost. Brazil has no further announcements of what the policy target will be beyond 2020; therefore we 
let  the  Brazil  emissions  grow  again  after  2020.  In  the  case  of  Mexico,  current  programs  have  pledge 
continuing reductions goals to meet a 50% reduction by 2050, if international assistance is provided to reduce 
emissions.  In  the  case  of  Mexico,  the  Copenhagen  pledges  by  2020  also  require  only  modest  reductions 
compared to our reference case of current policies scenario (emissions in 2020 from scenario 1a and 1b are 
only 3% apart). For our modeling, we consider that Mexico would not increase again from the 30% reduction 
level  considering  the  policies  that  indicate  Mexico  will  pursue  even  stricter  mitigation  targets.  We  do  not 
impose  a  50%  reduction  by  2050,  because  international  transfers  to  reach  emissions  to  that  level  seems 
unlikely so far, and because scenario 2e could be used to evaluate such as stringent policy. In this way, we 
can compare what would happen if Mexico  reaches the 30% and what if Mexico is able to further reduce 
emissions to 50%. 

Figure 7 shows total emissions trajectories in CO2e for each of the policies and Figure 8 shows the 
associated  policy  cost,  measured  as  loss  GDP  in  dollars  of  2005.  To  facilitate  policy  comparison,  we 
integrate the areas under the curves to show total cumulative emissions for each policy as well as total cost, 
although  with  this method,  for  the  moment,  we  are  not  discounting  costs  occurred  later  in  the  period  (see 
Figure 9). Regarding total emissions trajectories, the results show that for Brazil and Mexico the Copenhagen 
pledges require very different mitigation efforts. In the case of Brazil, almost no additional mitigation action 
is required in this scenario, since we considered in the baseline the reduction of emissions from deforestation 
that has already taken place. For Mexico, in contrast the Copenhagen voluntary goal is comparable in terms 
of emissions reduction to a high tax on CO2e emissions or cap reaching 50% reductions by 2050. For both 
countries the policies of a high carbon tax (scenario 2c) and a total emissions cap of 20% by 2050 (scenario 
2d) resulted in similar emissions reductions. As expected, a low carbon tax (scenario 2a) resulted for both 
countries in higher emissions at the beginning of the period and more emissions reduction by the end of the 
horizon.  The  most  stringent  scenario  was  the  cap  on  emissions  to  reach  50%  by  2050  only  with  CO2e 
(scenario 2g); however this scenario is built for modeling comparison purposes and more attention should be 
paid to scenario 2e that allows mitigation to occur in all the economy (this is particularly important for costs 
in Brazil). 

The  policies  modeled  imply  an  increasing  lost  GDP  from  the  beginning  of  the  policy  to  2050, 
growing from 4% GDP loss to 11% for Mexico and from 0 to 4% for Brazil in the different scenarios (see 
Figure 9). The policy cost is the highest in the stringent cap for both countries. Interestingly, total cumulative 
emissions are very similar in each of the countries under scenarios 2c and 2d (high carbon tax and cap on all 
emissions to reach 50% by 2050), and so are the total policy costs as shown in Figure 9b. However, as shown 
in Figures 8a and 8b the policy costs occur at different points in time, a key difference between these policies. 
For Brazil, a high carbon tax (policy 2c) has less costs at the beginning of the horizon compared to a cap to 
reach  20%  by  2050  (policy  2d).  While  total  policy  costs  are  of  the  same  magnitude,  once  discounted  the 
8 

 

policy 2c could be preferable (depending on the discount rate selected). The same conclusion could be draw 
for Mexico, although to a much lesser extent. Our results suggests also, that pricing carbon even with a low 
carbon tax of 10 dollars per ton CO2e that increase as the economy grows could have an important impact in 
total emissions trajectories. The low carbon tax policy achieves 25 and 28% of total cumulative emissions 
reductions in Brazil and Mexico, respectively, compared to the baseline emissions. In comparison, a cap on 
total GHG emissions to reach 50% reductions by 2050 (2e scenario), reduces 50 and 60% of total cumulative 
emissions  in  Brazil  and  Mexico,  respectively  the  total  cost  of  this  stringent  cap  policy  is  10  and  7  times 
higher for Brazil and Mexico, respectively. In the case of the high tax policy, the costs are 4.2 and 4.5 times 
higher than the low tax policy. This as a result of the upward slope of the mitigation curves, which reflects 
the fact that mitigation becomes more expensive as abatement increases and further reductions become more 
and more expensive.

4.1. Energy consumption 

 

In order to achieve emissions reductions, the countries can use less carbon intensive substitutes into 
their  production  and  consumption  activities,  deploy  new  low-carbon  technologies  into  their  production 
processes  and  end-use,  and/or  reduce  their  overall  consumption.  An  important  share  of  the  mitigation 
required will imply reduced energy consumption (Figures 10a and 10b). Compared to the reference scenario, 
in 2020 Brazil and Mexico reduce their primary energy use in similar shares of 4% and 14% for the low and 
high tax scenarios. By 2050, both countries needs to reduce its energy consumption in all scenarios between 
10 and 13% for the less stringent scenario (low carbon tax) and 34 and 42% in the 2e scenario, for Brazil and 
Mexico,  respectively.  This  with  the  exemption  of  the  Copenhagen  scenario  where  Brazil  is  allowed  to 
increased its emissions after 2020. 
4.2. Low-carbon electricity technologies deployment 

As shown in Figure 10b, policy 2a (low carbon tax) implies primarily a reduction in total electricity 
generation  in  Mexico  of  10%  less  than  the  baseline,  by  2050.  The  policy  also  triggers  a  slightly  higher 
penetration of wind energy in both countries, as shown in Figures 10a and 10b. For the rest of the scenarios, 
Brazil  continues  to  use  its  hydropower  and  adds  natural  gas  with  CCS,  and  more  wind.  In  contrast,  for 
Mexico, the rest of the scenarios require important deployment of new technologies in the power sector as 
well as additional decrements in generation, which reduces almost by half for the high tax and stringent cap 
scenarios.  For  the  high  tax  scenario  and  stringent  caps,  Mexico  deploys  natural  gas  and  coal  with  CCS 
technologies by 2050. Both countries will need to fully decarbonize their electricity mix in the stringent cap 
scenario controlling only CO2 emissions (policy 2g). 

It  is  worth  mentioning  that  while  we  focus  in  the  2050  horizon  in  this  paper,  we  estimated  the 
scenarios  results  up  to  2100  in  order  to  allow  future  exercises  in  the  integrated  modeling  system  IGSM 
model,  finding  other  technologies  also  playing  a  significant  role  later  in  the  period.  As  population  and 
economic  trends  push  for  more  energy  use  while  emissions  are  capped,  the  electric  power  sector  starts 
transitioning  to  a  more  drastic  change  to  low-carbon  technologies  in  the  second  half  of  the  century.  After 
2050,  our  results  show  a  transition  towards  wind  and  solar  technologies  at  fast  pace  under  the  stringent 
scenarios  2e  and  2g,  and  their  penetration  increases  also  in  all  other  scenarios.  The  later  deployment  of 
renewables  in  our  modeling  results  obey  to  two  sets  of  reasons.  First,  our  model  considers  the  costs  of 
replacing the build infrastructure already in place in the different regions (in other words, it internalizes the 
costs of vintaged capital), as well as institutional costs that slow-down the penetration of new technologies in 
the  model  (as  a  function  of  installed  capacity  in  the  previous  period).  Second,  the  intermittent  nature  of  

 

10 

renewables  in  our  model  is taken care of by imposing a requirement of full back-up capacity for

large-scale penetration of renewables, either with natural gas turbines or with bioelectricity plants, to account 
for  reliability  constraints.  Thus,  we  find  first  a  transition  towards  natural  gas  technologies  and  then  the 
deployment of zero emissions technologies, primarily wind and solar. Current model developments include 
more  detailed  studies  to  better  incorporate  the  operational  constraints  that  renewables  will  bring  to  power

systems  with  large-scale  penetration  of  renewables,  and  the  need  of  flexibility  options  such  as  storage 
technologies and transmission and distribution networks (Octaviano et al., forthcoming). We expect that if 
economically  available,  these  supporting  infrastructure  for  renewables  that  reduces  the  problems  of 
intermittency, could bring these technologies earlier into the power mix under climate policy. 
 
4.3. Land-use changes 

A careful analysis of changes in land-use driven by climate policy is of the utmost importance in the 
region.  While  agriculture  contributed  with  5%  and  3%  of  total  GDP  of  Brazil  and  Mexico  in  2010,  the 
population  working  on  this  sector  is  17%  and  13%  in  Brazil  and  Mexico.  An  important  number  of  the 
vulnerable population in these countries, including poor households and indigenous communities, depend on 
this  activity.  Thus,  the  consequences  for  farmers  and  communities  in  Brazil  and  Mexico  are  logically  of 
special  concern  for  policy  design.  In  addition  to  providing  important  ecosystem  services  including  carbon 
sequestration,  the  forests  and  special  ecosystems  in  Brazil  and  Mexico,  have  a  critical  value  for  their 
biodiversity; both Brazil and Mexico are among the 17 megadiverse countries of the world (Groombridge, 
1994).  In the past, economic growth has driven an expansion of agriculture and pasture, at the expense of 
forests and other ecosystems. Our economic modeling provides a high-level analysis of economic incentives 
that will drive land conversion under climate policies. Figure 11 shows EPPA model estimates for land uses 
in Brazil and Mexico, as a result of expected land conversion.

For  our  baseline  scenario,  we  consider  the  policies  that  Brazil  and  Mexico  have  implemented  to 
reduce deforestation. For Brazil, total land-use emissions are maintain to the level in 2005. Total cropland 
still expands, in order to meet food demand and biofuels production; total land cover for crops expands from 
8 to 22%. This expansion comes from conversion of other arable land (6%) and forests (8%). Pasture also 
expands from 17 to 19%, at the expense of forests. While Mexico has implemented policies to slow down 
deforestation rates in the country, it still experiences high deforestation rates. Without further policy efforts, 
we  expect  Mexico  could  decrease  from  38%  of  land  cover  in  forest  to  20%  by  the  end  of  the  century, 
expanding  agriculture  from  19  to  32%,  and  decreasing  pasture  from  47  to  42%.  In  addition  to  impacts  in 
deforestation,  an  important  land  use  change  driver  is  the  use  of  bioenergy.  In  our  reference  scenario,  we 
include the biofuels mandate implemented in 2010 by the US and the European Union, as well as the current 
policies to incentivize the use of biofuels in Brazil. For Brazil, the two tax scenarios increase the production 
of  bioenergy,  while  the  two  cap  scenarios  decrease  it  compared  to  the  reference;  for  Mexico  biofuels 
production increases in all scenarios (but remain relatively small given low flex-fuel fleet in the country).

4.4 Industry and Transport 

In the case of the industry, in Brazil electricity use increases in all scenarios. As expected, both coal 
and  natural  gas  use  decreases  as  a  result  of  carbon  policies.  In  response,  the  industry  increases  the  use  of 
liquid  fuels  until  2050  for  all  scenarios,  when  this  source  of  energy  is  substituted  by  more  electricity  (see 
Figure 12). In the case of Mexico, industrial natural gas and coal use drastically decreases in all scenarios; 
and  liquid  fuels  increases.  Electricity  use  also  decreases  given  its  large  share  of  fossil  energy,  and  starts 
increasing again at the end of the period when a cleaner electricity mix is in place (see Figure 13).

For the transportation sector, we find that in both countries the sector increases its energy use in the reference 
scenario and decreases with respect to the baseline in all the policy scenarios. For the 2e scenario, a reduction 
of a 30% and a 34% of energy use in transportation could be expected from the reference scenario for Brazil 
and Mexico, respectively. These percentages increase in the 2g scenario (target for CO2 emissions only) to 
48%.  These  results  underscore  the  relevance  of  the  transportation  sector  in  mitigation,  and  the  need  for 
alternatives  to  reduce  eciently  its  energy  use  including  more  fleet  flexibility,  public  transportation  and/or 
more  clean  technologies  such  as  electrification  of  transportation,  both  for  public  and  private  modes  (see 
Figure 14).

4.5 Energy Trade 

 

 

International trade of energy products is an important consideration in evaluating climate policy. In 
the case of oil trade, both Mexico and Brazil are currently experiencing profound changes in their oil sector, 
15 

 

although  the  two  defer  in  the  state  of  development  of  their  petroleum  industries.  While  Mexico  has  been 
exploiting oil resources for international trade since the 1970’s, Brazil has only recently started to be almost 
self-sufficient  in  terms  of  oil  and  analysts  and  policy  makers  in  the  country  expect  Brazil  to  become  an 
important oil exporter in the Americas, following its developments in deepwater sites (IEA, 2014, 2013; BP, 
2014) . In the case of Mexico, its main oil fields appear to have reached maturity; this situation has resulted 
in a milestone energy reform to canalize private investment in order to revitalize the oil industry, after the 
alarming decay of key oil fields. Manifold uncertainties surround the future development of the oil industry 
in both countries. New institutional arrangements to provide incentives for adequate levels of investment are 
needed. Also inherent technological challenges of the exploitation of more complex formations onshore and 
in  the  deep  ocean  are  to  be  taken  into  account  when  projecting  the  development  of  these  markets.  In  our 
reference  scenario,  we  consider  that  both  countries  will  be  able  to  revitalize  and  consolidate  their  oil 
industries, and thus remain being oil exporters. Following the IEA projection for Mexico, we consider that, 
despite  recent  declines  in  exports,  by  2020  the  country  will  recover  production  levels  of  2.9  mbd  (IEA, 
2014). In the case of Brazil, we consider 3 mbd production by 2020, also in accordance with (IEA, 2014). 

Figure 15 presents oil exports for Mexico and Brazil, respectively, with and without climate policy 
considering  this  positive  production  scenario.  The  most  stringent  climate  policy  for  the  energy  sector  (2g 
scenario) results in reduced oil exports for Mexico of 13% from the reference scenario and 47% for Brazil. 
With and without policy oil exports peak in the 2030s for both countries. In the case of Brazil, production 
grows but exports start declining as domestic production is used to meet fast-growing oil demand. Reduced 
exports  respond  to  a  contraction  in  economic  activity  internationally  resulting  from  carbon  policy;  oil 
resources get exported at a slower rate as all countries try to switch away from fossil energy when there is a 
price on carbon. Thus, results suggests that policy scenarios might influence how fast these resources could 
be developed, with implications on investments in energy infrastructure.

In addition to oil exports, we find that Brazil increases its biofuel exports in all scenarios, particularly 
under  the  tax  scenarios,  however  even  in  the  stringent  policy  scenario  biofuel  exports  are  about  0.2  EJ 
indicating that with the policies modeled we do not expect biofuels to play a major role in energy exports 
(see Figure 16). 

Regarding  energy  imports,  in  the  reference  scenario  both  countries  are  net  importers  of  refined  oil 
products and coal, as shown in Figures 17 and 18. Under climate policy, for all scenarios Brazil eliminates 
coal  imports  and  substitutes  for  natural  gas.  Brazil  also  increases  its  imports  of  refined  oil  products 

 

16 

particularly in 2050, when we expect domestic demand to be higher than national oil production. In the case 
of Mexico, coal imports are generally low (below 0.01 EJ in most scenarios), but increase in some scenarios 
as a result of its use in the power sector along with CCS technologies.

Natural gas is of strategic importance in Mexico  as it’s expected to meet  most of the power sector 
energy demand and is also important for industrial use (see 4.2 and 4.4), thus we describe in some detail our 
modeling assumptions for this fuel. In 2010, domestic demand for natural gas in Mexico was 6,341 million 
cubic feet per day (mmcfd) and production 5,004 mmcdd, resulting in total imports of 1458 mmcdd (SENER, 
2013). Demand and production estimates in EPPA are 10% higher than historical figures in 2010, with the 
same level of imports (See Figure 16). The Mexican government estimates that, by 2027, Mexico will reach a 
production of 6,848 mmcfd (the EPPA estimate for 2025 is 6,721). Using this baseline data by 2050, EPPA 
estimate of Mexico’s domestic production of natural gas is 12,552 mmcfd, requiring additional 2,117 imports 
mmcfd to satisfy demand in that year. In order to maintain imports below this level (between 14 and 20% of 
total demand) domestic production in the country needs to keep a fast-paced growth matching demand trends 
(see Figure 19). We consider for our reference case that domestic production of natural gas will be developed 

17 

 

to meet demand.  If policies are not put in place to canalize investment to develop local  resources and the 
supporting infrastructure1, imports will grow faster than the reference case presented by EPPA (up to the gap 
existing between the demand estimate and realized production). Our modeling results show that in the case of 
stringent  climate  policy  (scenario  2g),  natural  gas  imports  decrease  48%  from  reference,  as  a  result  of 
induced  energy  eciency  and  a  decreased  of  economic  activity  domestically  and  internationally  that  results 
from climate policy.

1Currently, Mexico has been experiencing acute infrastructure bottlenecks that have increased the imports of natural 
gas. In 2010, about 47% of the imports were identify by the Ministry of Energy as “logistic-imports” meaning those 
required due to lack of pipelines and other infrastructure to use local resources (See SENER (2013)).

It  is  worth  mentioning  that  without  investments  in  oil  and  gas  resources,  both  Mexico  and  Brazil  could 
substantially  increase  its  imports  of  both  energy  resources.  Due  to  the  above  mentioned  technological  and 
institutional uncertainties, the risks involved in developing fossil energy adds an important consideration to 
investing in energy diversification, such as renewables. Mexico, unlike Brazil that can rely in its hydro power 
resources  for  electricity  generation,  will  have  to  heavily  rely  on  imports  of  natural  gas  if  local  resources 
remain dicult to tap. In addition, if energy investment into oil exploration and exploitation is not timely, or if 
it  results  unsuccessful  for  technical  reasons,  both  countries  will  be  importing  oil  to  satisfy  the  growing 
demand  for  transportation  and  industrial  uses.  The  risks  involved  in  the  development  of  these  resources 
should be considered when crafting climate policy. 
 
5. Conclusions 

GHG emission reduction requires substantial changes in energy and land use practices. Because of a 
global nature of GHG impacts, a successful agreement to limit climate change needs a global participation. 
Mitigation  by  even  the  largest  emitters  alone  would  not  solve  the  problem  (Reilly  et  al.,  2012),  therefore, 
actions are needed from all emitters. So far, international climate negotiations face a challenge of finding a 
“fair” scheme for individual country’s contributions to GHG emission reduction at a global level. There are 
numerous proposals for burden sharing (IPCC, 2014) that look at equal percentage, equal marginal cost or 
same carbon price among the countries. Studies have shown that a global carbon tax or cap-and-trade system 
is  an  efficient  way  to  reduce  emissions.  However,  recent  approaches,  discussed  at  the  UN  conferences  in 
Copenhagen (UN, 2009) and Cancun (UN, 2010), focus on national plans that are very different from country 
to  country.  In  our  study  we  evaluated  the  options  and  implications  for  the  two  largest  Latin  American 
economies: Brazil and Mexico. We found that because energy and land use mixes in these two countries are 
very different, same carbon prices and emission caps lead to very different policy costs, namely cumulative 
costs in Mexico are about twice as high as in Brazil. Another difference is that Mexico’s major  source of 
GHG emissions comes from energy, while in Brazil agricultural activities are responsible for a largest share. 
Therefore,  a  policy  that  targets  only  energy  emissions  would  miss  many  other  sources  in  Brazil.  Energy 
efficiency plays an important role in mitigation scenarios for both countries. Energy and electricity uses are 
reduced in all policy scenarios in comparison to a no-policy scenario. In electricity sector, Brazil continues to 
rely  on  hydropower  with  some  additional  wind  and  natural  gas  with  CCS,  while  Mexico  employs  CCS 
substantially on fossil-based electricity. 

Land-use emissions policies are important to consider in both countries. In Brazil, a successful story 
of  dramatic  reduction  in  deforestation  between  2005  and  2010  should  be  maintained.  Mexico  should  use 
Brazil’s  example  of  deforestation  control  to  reduce  its  land  use  emissions.  While  Brazil  and  Mexico’s 
emissions  are  not  among  the  largest  in  the  world,  their  contribution  to  GHG  emissions  mitigation  are 
extremely important. First, these countries are key leaders among the middle-income countries that play an 
important role of engaging developing world in a climate negotiation process. Second, reaching substantial 
reductions  required  for  eliminating  the  worst  potential  consequences  of  future  climate  change,  need 
participation  from  every  country.  Third,  a  reduction  in  fossil  fuels  also  has  substantial  pollution  reduction 
benefits.  Our  study  confirms  that  climate  policy  designs  chosen  by  Brazil  and  Mexico  and  proposed  in 
Copenhagen and Cancun are solid steps in a right direction. Continuing with developing their own strategies 
that fits their countries’ energy and land use composition better is a wise policy that should be maintained. 
Our study illustrates the challenges that lie ahead in the process of further GHG mitigation in Mexico and 
Brazil.
