Abstract 

 
This  paper presents  a contribution  to  the empirical  literature concerning the relationship  between  social 
security  and  public  debt  in  emerging  economies.  In  particular,  several  economic  and  social  shocks,  as 
income  inequality,  were  considered  in  the  analysis.  Based  on  Brazilian  data  from  2004  to  2010,  and 
taking into account the effects of shocks on variables which are essential to the public debt and the social 
security deficit, two sets of GMM models were considered. Furthermore, with the objective of testing the 
results,  a  GMM  system  model  was  built.  The  findings  confirmed  that  the  social  security  deficit 
significantly contributes to an increase in the public debt. Regarding the effects on social security, it was 
observed  that  an  increase  in  the  level  of  formality  in  the  economy  reduces  the  deficit.  In  contrast,  a 
reduction in income inequality, real increase in the minimum wage, and increase in health benefits imply 
an increase in the social security deficit. Therefore, these variables play a crucial role in the search for an 
efficient social security management system and cannot be overlooked in ensuring fiscal sustainability.

Resumo 

 
Este trabalho apresenta uma contribuição para a literatura empírica relativa à relação entre a previdência 
social e a dívida pública nas economias emergentes. Em particular, vários choques econômicos e sociais, 
como  a  desigualdade  de  renda,  foram  considerados  na  análise.  Com  base  em  dados  do  Brasil  para  o 
período de 2004-2010, e levando em conta os efeitos dos choques sobre as variáveis  que são essenciais 
para  a  dívida  pública  e  o  déficit  da  previdência  social,  dois  conjuntos  de  modelos  GMM  foram 
considerados.  Além  disso,  com  o  objetivo  de  testar  os  resultados,  um  modelo  de  sistema  GMM  foi 
construído. Os resultados confirmaram que o déficit da previdência social contribui de forma significativa 
para  o  aumento  da  dívida  pública.  Com  relação  aos  efeitos  sobre  a  previdência  social,  observou-se  que 
um  aumento  no  nível  de  formalidade  da  economia  reduz  o  déficit.  Em  contraste,  uma  redução  na 
desigualdade  de  renda,  um  aumento  real  do  salário  mínimo  e  um  aumento  na  concessão  de  auxílios-
doença implica um aumento do déficit da previdência social. Portanto, estas variáveis desempenham um 
papel  crucial  na  busca  por  um  sistema  de  gerenciamento  eficiente  da  previdência  social  e  não  pode  ser 
negligenciado para garantir a sustentabilidade fiscal.

1. Introduction 

Since 1999, Brazilian economic policy has been based on the tripod of inflation targeting, primary 
surplus and flexible exchange rates. In particular, the introduction of primary surplus targets has guided 
fiscal policy and worked as a safeguard for the inflation targeting system. In other words, the patterns of 
primary  surplus  are  essential  to  explain  the  evolution  of  fiscal  and  monetary  policies.  Therefore,  it  is 
crucial to identify and analyze which factors can erode this framework sustained by the primary surplus. 

Given the importance of the difference between revenues and expenditures of the General Social 
Security  for the primary result of the federal  government,  the long-term  financial viability of the social 
security system has been one of the main topics of fiscal policy discussed in Brazil in recent decades. The 
Brazilian  pension  system  runs  at  a  deficit  and  may  become  fiscally  unsustainable  in  the  future.  As  a 
result, the need for funding of the social security system represents a source of fiscal imbalance that could 
set public debt onto an unsustainable path. 

In  recent  years,  the  federal  government  has  adopted  a  series  of  social  measures  to  increase  the 
average  standard  of  living  of  the  population.  Those  measures  include,  for  example:  encouraging  the 
formalization of the Brazilian labor market, promoting a real increase in the minimum wage and reducing 
income inequality in the labor market. The implementation of this social policy has had a direct impact on 
the labor market and, consequently, has implications for the financing of the social security system. 

This  paper  seeks  to  make  a  contribution  to  the  literature  on  public  debt  and  social  security  by 
considering a variety of economic and social shocks. It is important to highlight that this study presents, 
in an innovative way, issues that have been neglected by the literature, but which are fundamental for the 
management of economic policy. As examples of this, we can cite the analysis of the effects of income 
inequality on the social security deficit and the impact of the social security deficit on the evolution of the 
Brazilian public debt. 

In short, the main objective of this paper is to present empirical evidence of the relation between 
social security and public debt, and of the effects of social policies, adopted by the federal  government, 
on the social security deficit. To this end, several models were estimated using the generalized method of 
moments (GMM). In addition to estimates of individual models, an estimation of systems of simultaneous 
equations was also performed. 
 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief summary of 
the  literature  on  public  debt  management.  Section  3  presents  a  short  review  of  the  literature  on  social 
security.  Section  4  shows  empirical  evidence,  through  an  econometric  analysis,  of  the  relationship 
between the social security system and public debt and of the relationship between the social policies of 
the federal government and the social security system. The last section presents the conclusions. 
 
2. Public debt: main features in the literature 

It is possible to identify three perspectives regarding public debt management in the literature. The 
first, examines the problem of dynamic inconsistency of fiscal policies, and is represented by the models 
of Giavazzi and Pagano (1990) and Calvo and Guidotti (1990). The second, which considers the model of 
Barro (2003), seeks to determine the optimal structure for public debt, considering a smoothing out of tax 
revenues  in  an  environment  in  which  public  spending  is  exogenous.  The  last  view,  represented  by  the 
models of Missale, Giavazzi and Benigno (2002) and Giavazzi and Missale (2004), seeks stabilization of 
the public debt/GDP ratio. In general, all these models conclude that an increase in the average maturity 
and the partial indexation of public debt are optimal strategies for public debt management. 

The  Giavazzi  and  Pagano  model  (1990)  focuses  on  the  analysis  of  the  roll-over  of  public  debt. 
Consequently,  the  amount,  average  maturity  and  amortization  structure  of  public  debt  are  important 
elements  in  this  study.  The  model  evaluates  whether  the  choice  of  a  particular  maturity  structure  can 
mitigate the risks of a crisis of confidence. Four basic assumptions are adopted: (i) an open economy with 
a  fixed  exchange  rate  regime,  (ii)  free  capital  mobility,  (iii)  imperfect  public  information  about  the 
preferences of the government or the central bank’s ability to maintain the fixed exchange rate, and (iv) a 
high stock of public debt needing to be rolled over in all periods. The conclusion is that the central bank’s 
ability  to  withstand  a  crisis  of  confidence  depends  on  its  success  in  managing  the  public  debt.  The 
concentration of debt maturities in a few periods is detrimental, because in times of crisis of confidence

the government is obliged to pay higher risk premiums. Therefore, a good strategy would be to increase 
the  average  maturity  of  government  securities,  as  well  as  to  distribute  their  maturity  dates  evenly  over 
time. 

Calvo and Guidotti’s model (1990) considers several environments for optimal indexing structure 
and  maturity  of  public  debt.  Additionally,  the  restriction  corresponds  to  a  social  loss  function  which 
includes taxation and inflation rate. The four basic assumptions of the model are: (i) the stock of debt is a 
predetermined  variable,  (ii)  government  spending  is  the  source  of  uncertainty  in  the  model,  (iii)  strict 
purchasing  power  parity  is  considered,  and  (iv)  the  current  government  can  curb  the  next  government 
with  respect  to  the  use  of  instruments  of  economic  policy.  The  result  suggests  that  the  indexation  of 
public  debt  is  desirable  in  order  to  avoid  the  use  of  an  inflation  tax.  However,  full  indexation  is  not 
recommended  because  it  can  generate  an  increase  in  taxation  as  a  source  of  financing  for  the  public 
sector. Therefore, the optimal strategy  would be  public debt  with  long-term  maturity, which is  partially 
indexed. 

Barro (2003) found that smoothing taxation stimulates the government to issue government bonds, 
the  payments  of  which  are  contingent  on  government  spending  and  taxation.  Hence,  when  public 
expenditure  is  equal  in  all  periods,  public  debt  should  be  structured  as  indexed  perpetuities  (consoles). 
One advantage of adopting this structure is the ability to isolate the  budget constraints from unexpected 
changes in the securities of different maturities indexed to the price index. 

Missale, Giavazzi and Benigno (2002) made an empirical analysis that considered the maturity of 
government securities suitable for fiscal stabilization. It was assumed that the stabilization of public debt 
would  be  achieved  through  the  attainment  of  fiscal  surplus  targets.  The  analysis  included  72  cases  of 
fiscal  stabilization,  between  1975  and  1998,  in  the  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and 
Development  (OECD)  countries.  The  authors  concluded  that  the  optimal  strategy  is  to  increase  the 
average maturity of public debt. 

Based  on  the  analysis  of  the  stabilization  of  the  Brazilian  public  debt/GDP  ratio,  Giavazzi  and 
Missale (2004) recommended that the government find sources of financing that offer low costs and low 
volatility  of  returns.  Thus,  the  choice  of  public  debt  instruments  involves  a  trade-off  between  risk  and 
expected cost of debt servicing. Under this view, the risk is minimized when an instrument has low return 
and when it is  also  capable of offering protection against  fluctuations in  the primary  surplus  and  in  the 
public  debt/GDP  ratio.  The  findings  denoted  that  the  use  of  pre-fixed  government  bonds  and  price-
indexed securities was the best strategy for public debt management. 
 
2.1. Change in the Brazilian public debt management 

As  a  result  of  a  payment  balance  crisis  trigged  by  successive  speculative  currency  attacks  on 
several emerging economies in the second half of the 1990s, the Brazilian government adopted a flexible 
exchange  rate  system  in  January  of  1999.  Due  to  the  exchange  rate  overshooting  and  the  fact  that 
approximately 25% of the public debt  had been indexed to  the exchange  rate at  that time, the Brazilian 
National  Treasury  adopted  a  new  strategy  for  managing  the  country’s  public  debt.  The  main  objectives 
were  the  improvement  of  the  composition  of  public  debt  and  the  lengthening  of  the  maturities  of 
government  securities.  One  important  change  introduced  was  the  establishment  of  primary  surplus 
targets.  As  a  result,  the  economic  policy  was  changed  and  the  cornerstone  of  the  Brazilian  economy 
became the tripod of inflation targeting, primary surplus, and floating exchange rates. 

Despite  the  changes  introduced  in  the  political  economy,  which  were  briefly  successful,  the 
beginning of the 2000s was marked by successive shocks to the Brazilian economy that led to the failure 
to  meet  the  inflation  targets  (see  figure  1).1  This  environment  created  a  macroeconomic  instability  that 
implied a reduction in the maturities of government securities. This scenario changed only after 2005 due 
to the success in achieving the targets for primary surplus and the consequent fall in the public debt/GDP 
ratio.  

After  2002  the  National  Treasury  adopted  an  assets  and  liabilities  management  strategy  that 
strengthened  the  substitution  of  interest  rate  indexed  securities  (Selic-indexed  bonds)  and  exchange

indexed securities by fixed rate securities and inflation indexed securities.2The result of this strategy was 
a  considerable  increase  in  the  proportion  of  fixed  rate  and  inflation-indexed  government  securities  (see 
figure  2).  Moreover,  the  proportion  of  exchange  indexed  securities  became  negligible.  Nevertheless, 
although the proportion of Selic-indexed bonds was decreased, it remains very high (approximately 35%).

An important implication of the Brazilian public debt framework is that the impact caused by an 
increase in the interest rate (Selic) to reduce inflationary pressure implies pressure to increase the public 
debt/GDP ratio. It is important to highlight that the combination of inflation targeting, a large portion of 
the public debt being indexed to the interest rate, and the short average maturity of the public debt, creates 
interdependence between fiscal and monetary policies. In particular, the generation of primary surplus has 
an  important  role  in  this  system  because  it  contributes  to  fiscal  balance  which,  in  turn,  is  one  of  the 
preconditions to the success of inflation targeting.3 

The  generation  of  primary  surplus  depends  on  the  successful  implementation  of  fiscal  policy  to 
achieve  its  goals.  A  successful  fiscal  policy  is  one  which  is  able  to  rationalize  public  expenditure  to 
produce primary surpluses. A significant source of government expenditures is the social security system 
expenses. An imbalanced social security system, as is the case in Brazil, represents a permanent drain of 
public resources. Therefore, the primary result of the social security system is an important variable for 
analysis of the management of Brazilian public debt. 

 

3. Social security literature: main features 

In the middle of the last century, the change in the demographic profile of the developed countries 
stimulated the literature on social security. The increase in life expectancy and the reduction in the birth 
rates  implied  an  increase  in  the  elderly/young  ratio  (United  Nations,  2007).  Furthermore,  since  in  most 
countries  the  social  security  system  in  effect  is  the  pay-as-you-go  kind,  the  consequences  on  long-term 
financial viability are an increase in the payment of social security benefits and a decreased funding base 
for the system.4 
                                                           
2 Regarding this strategy, see Back and Musgrave (1941), Lucas and Stokey (1983), Bohn (1988), and Calvo (1988). 
3 Fiscal balance eliminates the possibility of the “unpleasant monetarist arithmetic” taking place (see Sargent and Wallace, 1981). 
4 For an analysis of social security systems, see Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (2004a).

Samuelson (1958) was one of the first authors to study the problem of social security in a general 
equilibrium  context  and  he  demonstrated  that  the  social  security  pay-as-you-go  system  corrects  the 
fundamental market incompleteness (for example, the impossibility of writing contracts with the unborn). 
Moreover,  in  the  overlapping  generation  model  of  Samuelson  (1958),  the  market  results  were  not 
efficient, so that the transfer of resources from the young generation to the elderly generation, through a 
social security pay-as-you-go system, could increase the welfare of a society. 

Mulligan  and  Sala-i-Martin  (2004b),  based  on  Browning’s  model  (1975),  considered  three 
generations of the same size: young people, adults, and old people. These three groups  were required to 
choose whether or not to adopt the social security pay-as-you-go system. The proposal was as follows: in 
each period, young people and adults would pay a contribution of T, and the old people would receive a 
pension of 2T. The conclusion was that adults and old people support this system because their net gain is 
T and 2T, respectively. In turn, young people are indifferent, because their net gain is zero. 

Diamond  (1977)  argues  that  the  choice  of  a  pay-as-you-go  system  is  required  due  to  the 
shortsighted action of individuals when they are young. Most individuals are not forward-looking enough 
in  their  youth  and,  therefore,  do  not  save  enough  to  maintain  the  same  standard  of  living  in  old  age. 
According to Diamond (1977), this may be because young people lack the necessary information to judge 
their needs in old age, or are unable to make effective decisions about long-term issues, or, simply, fail to 
place sufficient importance on their future necessities. 

Cooley and Soares (1999) argue that a pay-as-you-go system can also be chosen and maintained in 
a  sustainable  way  in  societies  where  economic  agents  are  rational,  forward-looking,  and  self-interested. 
Under this view, pay-as-you-go systems cause dynamic inconsistency and therefore rational agents do not 
believe in their sustainability. As a way to avoid this problem, mechanisms of reputation and credibility 
among the generations should be used. The social security system can be thought as a dynamic game that 
involves  repeated  iterations  between  the  generations.  If  generation  t  expects  that  its  act  to  stop  the 
financing of pensions of generation t-1 will be followed by the future generation t+1, a reputational trade-
off is introduced in generation t. Generation t finds that the cost of stopping the financing of the system 
can  be  very  high  because,  for  its  own  generation,  the  system  may  collapse  at  t+1  (when  generation  t 
would  benefit  from  the  pension  system).  Therefore,  to  ensure  the  system  at  t+1,  generation  t  disclaims 
possible  short-term  benefits  that  it  would  earn  with  the  discontinuation  of  financing  of  the  system  for 
generation t-1. 

As identified by Feldstein (1974), the pay-as-you-go systems can stimulate workers to take early 
retirement.  In  addition,  Feldstein  (1974,  1996),  Kotlikoff  (1979),  and  Seidman  (1986),  show  empirical 
evidence that the choice of pay-as-you-go systems reduces significantly the long-term pattern of capital-
intensive accumulation and standard of living in those countries. 

In  contrast  to  the  above  results,  recent  empirical  studies  have  shown  that  social  policies  play  a 
positive influence on economic growth. Zhang and Zhang (2004), through an empirical analysis of cross-
section data for 64 countries during the period 1960 to 2000, concluded that pay-as-you-go systems tend 
to  stimulate  per  capita  economic  growth  by  reducing  birth  rate  and  increasing  investment  in  human 
capital without affecting the saving rate. 

These beneficial results of the action of social policies were also found by Justino (2007) through 
an analysis of panel data for 14 Indian states over the period 1973 to 1999. The findings indicate that the 
strengthening  of  social  security  contributes  to  reducing  poverty  and  increasing  economic  growth.  In  a 
similar  vein,  Alan,  Sultana  and  Butt  (2010)  studied  the  long-term  relationship  between  social  spending 
and economic growth in 10 developing Asian countries. The main conclusion was that spending on social 
policies results in faster economic growth. 

 

3.1. Social security in Brazil: main variables 

Based on the literature on social security, this section identifies the key variables for the analysis 
of the Brazilian case. The first variable to consider is the sickness benefit. Figure 3 shows that there was a 
significant  increase  in  the  granting  of  sickness  benefits  to  social  security  beneficiaries  over  the  past 
decade.  In  addition,  it  was  observed  that  the  average  value  of  the  sickness  benefit  under  the  Social 
Security  General  Regime  (SSGR)  was  always  greater  than  the  average  of  all  other  benefits  paid  by  the 

 

5 

SSGR.  This  can  be  explained  by  the  deferral  of  retirements  due  to  the  application  of  a  social  security 
factor  and  stricter  criteria  for  granting  retirements.  Other  factors  that  contributed  to  the  increase  in  the 
sickness  benefits  were:  adverse  economic  conditions  at  the  beginning  of  the  decade,  which  raised  the 
unemployment rate and, thus, sickness benefits were seen as a complement to household income; and the 
facility to get this benefit.

Another variable that is important in analyzing the behavior of the Brazilian social security system 
is the minimum wage. Figure 4 demonstrates that approximately 60% of SSGR benefits are equal to one 
minimum wage. This percentage shows the importance that the minimum wage policy has on the social 
security  budget.  Furthermore,  one  cannot  neglect  the  systematic  readjustment  of  the  minimum  wage,  at 
rates higher than the inflation rate.

One aspect that should be considered in the study of social security in Brazil is the formality of the 
labor  market,  which  directly  affects  the  social  security  budget.  The  social  security  contribution  on 
payrolls is one of the SSGR’s main sources of revenue. The higher the level of formality in the economy, 
the  greater  is  the  number  of  working-age  workers  who  are  contributing  to  the  social  security  system. 
Consequently,  there  is  an  increase  in  the  social  security  revenues.  Figure  5  shows  that  social  security 
protection has been increasing in recent  years and that the social security deficit  has begun to decrease, 
due to an increase in the number of contributors to the SSGR.

It  is  important  to  highlight  that  the  implications  of  income  inequality  for  the  Brazilian  social 
security deficit should not be overlooked. Income inequality is particularly relevant because contributions 
from workers’ wages are main sources of revenue for the social security system. In general, it is expected 
that a decrease in income inequality would imply an increase in the poorest households’ income, which 
would  foster  conditions  for  admission  into  the  social  security  system.  Figure  6  shows  that  average 
nominal  income  is  lower  than  the  social  security  ceiling.  Moreover,  the  percentage  of  workers  with 
income  above  the  ceiling  corresponds  to,  on  average,  only  5%  of  the  population.  This  observation  is 
important because it shows that, although undesirable, an increase in income inequality could reduce the 
social security deficit. As a small portion of the population have income above the ceiling, an increase in 
the inequality may imply an increase in the social security revenue.

4. Empirical analysis 
 
This  section  shows  empirical  evidence  of  the  relation  between  the  social  security  deficit  and 
federal  public  debt  in  the  Brazilian  economy.  Moreover,  it  demonstrates  how  the  federal  government’s 
social policies impact the social security deficit. 

Regarding the federal  public debt,  in  addition  to  the effect  of the social  security deficit, we  also 
considered  shocks  transmitted  by  relevant  variables  to  explain  the  behavior  of  the  public  debt  (e.g., 
average maturity, the primary surplus, interest rates, and exchange rates). Since social programs may have 
an  important  role  in  the  analysis  concerning  the  social  security  deficit,  the  following  variables  were 
considered  in  this  study:  the  amount  of  sickness  benefits  paid  by  the  National  Social  Security  Institute 
(INSS), the financial impact of minimum wage on the social security costs, the level of formality in the 
Brazilian economy, and inequality indexes. 

One  difficulty  in  estimating  the  effects  of  economic  shocks  on  the  social  security  system  and 
public debt is the endogeneity problem, or identification problem. It is hard to distinguish, for example, if, 
after  an  economic  shock,  an  increase  in  the  social  security  deficit  is  due  to  a  decrease  in  the  level  of 
formality in the economy (due to, for example, the slowdown in economic activity) or due to an increase 
in  the  amount  of  benefits  (for  example,  as  a  result  of  times  of  economic  crisis).  Likewise,  it  is  hard  to 
identify  whether  an  increase  in  the  public  debt,  caused  by  an  economic  shock,  is  a  consequence  of: 
reduction in  the primary surplus, reduction in the average maturity of public debt,  an increase in public 
debt service, or an increase in the social security deficit. 

One  way  to  avoid  the  endogeneity  and  identification  problems  in  the  estimations  is  to  use  the 
generalized  method  of  moments  -  GMM  (Hall,  2005).  One  advantage  of  the  GMM  in  relation  to,  for 
example,  the  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  is  that  it  presents  robust  estimators  even  in  the  presence  of 
serial autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity or non-linearity, which is typical in macroeconomic time series 
models (Hansen, 1982). 

In  order  to  assess  the  relevance  of  the  management  of  the  social  security  system  for  the  federal 
public debt,  and the influence of  federal  social  policies on the social  security management system,  thus 
bypassing  potential  endogeneity  problems,  two  sets  of  GMM  models  were  estimated:  (i)  the  first  set 
examines the effects of changes in the social security deficit on the federal public debt, and (ii) the second 
set examines the effects of changes in the social variables on the social security deficit.

It is important to note that the choice of the independent variables in the models was based on the 
literature about the subject, and the use of lags followed the general to the specific method in a search for 
the  most  parsimonious  model.  In  addition,  to  provide  robustness  to  the  analysis  and  to  observe  the 
validity of the models, a GMM system model was built. 
 
4.1. Data 

A key variable for this study is the social security deficit. The evolution of this variable allows one 
to conjecture how social security management can contribute to the sustainability of the  public debt. As 
shown  by  Figure  7,  the  trajectory  for  the  public  sector  borrowing  requirement  -  INSS  (series  extracted 
from the Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) site) presents a structural break at January 2004. Hence, as a way 
of  eliminating  possible  problems  in  the  estimations  due  to  the  instability  of  parameters  (the  “Lucas 
critique”), the period considered in the empirical analysis extends from January 2004 to December 2010.

period analyzed in this paper, there is a decreasing trend in the public debt/GDP ratio. An explanation for 
this observation is a consequence of the change in the management of public debt that was introduced in 
1999. 
- INSS - public sector borrowing requirement - INSS - primary result - %GDP - flows accumulated in 12 
months  (available  from  CBB).  In  general,  it  is  expected  that  an  increase  in  the  INSS  would  cause  an 
increase in the public debt and thus, a positive relation between these variables exists. 
-  MTDEBT–  public  debt  average  maturity  –  in  months  (available  from  Brazilian  National  Treasury  – 
CODIV).  The  public  debt  average  maturity  increased  approximately  40%  between  January  2006  (29 
months) and December 2010 (40 months). As an increase in the average maturity can reduce the public 
debt  service  costs  (see,  Giavazzi  and  Pagano,  1990),  it  is  expected  that  there  exists  a  negative  relation 
between this variable and the public debt. 
- SURPLUS - public sector borrowing requirement  - primary  result  - %GDP  - flows accumulated in  12 
months  (available  from  CBB).5  In  general,  with  exception  of  the  period  after  the  subprime  crisis,  the 
primary surplus has shown a relative stability (between 2.4% and 2.8%). It is important to highlight that 
the systematic generation of primary surplus reduces the public debt default risk which, in turn, decreases 
the cost of the public debt. Therefore, it was expected that the empirical evidence would reveal a negative 
relation between primary surplus and public debt. 
 
were also considered in this analysis:6 
- SELIC - interest rate - Selic accumulated in the month in annual terms (available from CBB). Selic is the 
main indexing factor of the federal public debt  and the main instrument  of monetary policy. Due to the 
high relevance of this variable on the public debt composition, a positive relation between these variables 

Based  on  the  composition  of  the  federal  public  debt,  the  main  indexing  factors  over  the  period 

                                                           
5 Positive values correspond to the primary surplus in the series. 
6 It is important to note that although in the recent period the price-indexed securities have grown considerably, they are not considered in 
this study due to their lack of significance for the public debt.

- EXCH - exchange rate - free - United States dollar (purchase)  - period average (available from CBB). 
Even though the proportion of exchange rate indexed bonds has been decreasing substantially, it was one 
of the main indexing factors over the period. It is expected that currency valuations (decreases in EXCH) 
contribute to a decrease in the public debt. 
(ii) variables with effect on the INSS 
-  AUX  –  sickness  benefit  paid  by  National  Social  Security  Institute.  It  is  a  result  of  the  ratio  between 
concessions  of  sickness  benefit  and  all  benefits  paid  by  the  SSGR  (both  series  available  from  Social 
Statistical Bulletin - flows accumulated in 12 months). The trajectory of this variable reveals a significant 
increase until the first quarter of 2007 (representing almost 56% of all benefits). From the second quarter 
of 2007, there was a decreasing trend, but the relevance is still very significant, being approximately 45% 
of the total. In short, it is expected that there exists a positive relation of this variable with the INSS. 
- WMIN - financial impact of minimum wage on social security expenditures (% GDP). This series is the 
result of the ratio between the total of benefits equal to one minimum wage paid by the SSGR (available 
from Social Statistical Bulletin - flows accumulated in 12 months) and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP 
–  flows  accumulated  in  12  months  –  available  from  CBB).  It  is  important  to  highlight  that  the  real 
increase  in  the  minimum  wage  has  a  significant  impact  on  the  social  security  budget  and  thus  it  is 
expected that an increase in this variable implies an increase in the INSS.

EMPF 

In  addition  to  the  aforementioned  variables,  the  consequence  of  the  level  of  formality  in  the 
Brazilian  economy  on  the  INSS  was  also  considered.  It  is  expected  that  a  greater  level  of  formality 
reduces the INSS due to the increase in the government’s tax revenue. Hence, the following variables are 
considered in this study: 
- 
from  
CBB). In the period analyzed in this paper, there is a strong increasing trend over the period. A possible 
justification for this observation is the favorable macroeconomic environment and the policies adopted by 
the federal government for increasing the level of formality. 
- CT_PO – Brazilian labor Market – formality rate. It is a result of the ratio between the employed people 
(registered) and occupied people (total) – both series are available from CBB. In this period, the trajectory 
shows a strong increasing trend.

index 

– 

As in the case of a greater level of formality, a lower income inequality may also be able to reduce 

the INSS. Hence, the following indices are considered: 
- GINI – Gini coefficient – measures the inequality of a distribution, a value of 0 expressing total equality 
and a value of 1 maximal inequality. This coefficient is the result of information available from Monthly 
Employment Survey - Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). In this period, this variable 
shows a decreasing trend over the period. This observation matters because a major source of revenue for 
social security is the levy on the workers’ remuneration. Therefore, a decrease in inequality can indicate 
an  increase  in  workers’  remuneration,  which,  in  turn,  could  cause  an  increase  in  the  social  security 
revenues.  
- THEIL – Theil index is a statistic used to measure economic inequality. This index is calculated based 
on information available from Monthly Employment Survey – IBGE. As the Gini coefficient, a value of 0 
expresses total equality and a value of 1 maximal inequality. 
 
4.2. Empirical evidence 

To preliminarily evaluate the relation between the aforementioned variables with DEBT and INSS, 
figure  8  shows  scatter  plot  diagrams  with  correlations.  With  the  exception  of  the  correlation  between 
DEBT  and  SURPLUS,  all  correlations  are  in  accordance  with  the  theoretical  view  for  the  analysis 
regarding  public  debt.7In  a  similar  manner,  except  for  WMIN,  the  correlations  for  INSS  are  also  in 
agreement with the theoretical perspective.8 
                                                           
7  A  possible  reason  for  the  positive  correlation  between  DEBT  and  SURPLUS  is  that  an increase  in  the  primary  surplus  does  not have  an 
immediate effect on the public debt. 
8 It is true that while the financial impact of the minimum wage on the social security expenditures had a strong growth over the period, the 
INSS had a decreasing trend. However, the decrease in INSS is a result of other economic and social factors that offset the positive effects on 
the INSS of an increase in the WMIN.

4.2.1. Economic shocks on public debt 
 
public debt, two specifications (GMM models) were considered:

With  the  objective  of  estimating  the  effect  of  economic  shocks,  especially  from  the  INSS,  on 

; e 

, 

(2) 
where, µt ~ N(0,2). 

A  first  step  in  time  series  analysis  is  to  check  the  presence  of  unit  root.  Hence,  the  augmented 
Dickey-Fuller  test  (ADF)  and  the  Phillips-Perron  (PP)  test  were  performed  (see  table  A.1  -  appendix). 
The results indicate that the use of the series in first difference in the estimation of equations (1) and (2) 
would be adequate, however it is possible that a linear combination of series is stationary even in the case 
of non-stationary series.9 Hence, cointegration tests were performed on both specifications. The selection 
of  lags  for  the  tests  was  made  based  on  Akaike  and  Hannan-Quinn  criteria  in  a  vector-autoregressive 
model.  For  both  specifications,  the  number  of  lags  is  2  (see  table  A.2  –  appendix).  Furthermore,  the 
inclusion  of  intercept  and  trend  is  based  on  the  Pantula  principle  (see  Harris,  1995).  The  cointegration 
tests  proposed  by  Johansen  (1991,  LR  test  statistic),  based  on  the  significance  of  the  estimated 
eigenvalues,  indicate  that  there  is  a  relation  of  long-term  equilibrium  among  the  series  for  both 
specifications  and  thus  the  equations  can  be  estimated  with  the  series  in  levels  without  the  problem  of 
spuriousness in the result10. 

The  GMM  method  minimizes  a  function  that  represents  the  moment  conditions  being  carefully 
weighed. If the moment conditions are correct, their average is zero. In addition, it is necessary that the 
instruments used in GMM are lagged one or more periods, as a prerequisite to predict the contemporary 
variables that were not available at time t. As pointed out by Wooldridge (2001, p. 95), “to obtain a more 
efficient  estimator  than  two-stage  least  squares  (or  ordinary  least  squares),  one  must  have  overriding 
restrictions.”  In  order  to  test  the  validity  of  moment  conditions  and  test  over-identifying  restrictions  in 
each estimated model, a standard J-test was performed (see Hansen, 1982; and Cragg, 1983). As a way to 
help predict the contemporary variables which are not available at time t, we used instrumental variables 
uncorrelated with the regression residuals. 

Table  1  presents  the  GMM  estimation  results  for  equations  (1)  and  (2).  In  order  to  consider  the 
effect  of  the  subprime  crisis  on  public  debt,  a  dummy  variable  was  included  in  the  estimation  of  both 
models.  Both  estimates  showed  an  adjusted  R2  greater  than  0.90  and  J-statistics  that  validate  the 
instruments used. 

The estimated results  reveal  that the  INSS has significant  influence on public debt.  Both  models 
indicate that an increase in the INSS causes an increase in the public debt/GDP ratio (INSS coefficient is 
positive  coefficient  and  significant).  This  result  is  important  because  it  shows  that  a  social  security 
management system, capable of reducing the INSS, would contribute to public debt sustainability. 

The coefficients regarding lagged federal debt are positive and have statistical significance. This 
result indicates that economic shocks on public debt are persistent. Furthermore, the estimates show that 
the  coefficients  of  other  variables  have  statistical  significance  and  signs  according  to  the  theoretical 
arguments.  In  other  words,  increases  in  the  SELIC  and  EXCH  lead  to  increases  in  public  debt.  On  the 
other hand,  an increase in primary surplus contributes to  a decrease in  public debt.  The only result that 
was different from what would be expected, according to the theoretical perspective, is the coefficient of 
the  MTDEBT  (positive  sign).  However,  this  observation  is  consistent  with  the  idea  that  in  economies 
where  credibility  is  not  sufficiently  developed  the  strategy  to  extend  the  public  debt  may  imply  an 
increase  in  SELIC  and thus  in  public  debt  service.  Regarding  the  coefficients  of  the  dummies,  it shows 
that they are negative and statistically significant. A possible explanation for this result is due to the sharp 
fall in  the  SELIC to  neutralize the recessive effects  of the crisis  which, in turn, reduced the public debt 
service cost. 
                                                           
9 Tests ADF and PP are in disagreement regarding the presence of unit root in SELIC. As a consequence, the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-
Shin (KPSS) test was performed and the result is that SELIC is I(1) – see table A.1 - appendix.

From estimated coefficients in equations (1) and (2) (see table 1) the effects on federal public debt 
at period t are calculated. The shocks of one standard deviation in the explanatory variables at period t-1 
are  shown  in  table  2.11  The  shock  of  one  standard  deviation  on  INSSt-1  causes  a  positive  change  on  the 
federal public debt at period t which corresponds to 2.23 basis points (b.p.).

Economic shocks on DEBT 

Note: Confidence interval is calculated by Monte Carlo simulation with 10.000 repetitions. 

 

The  immediate  impacts  transmitted  by  the  MTDEBT  and  SELIC  are  relatively  close  (about  3.5 
b.p.). The impact of lower magnitude is the EXCH (less than 1 b.p.). Although the shock transmitted by 
the  SURPLUS  is  greater  (in  absolute  terms)  only  to  the  EXCH,  it  contributes  to  a  negative  growth  of 
public  debt  of  approximately  1.74  b.p.  Moreover,  confidence  intervals  are  calculated  for  the  estimates 
(see  table  2).  If  the  weighting  matrix  used  in  GMM  estimations  is  efficient,  the  estimators  are 
asymptotically  normal.  Given  the  normality  of  the  coefficients  and  their  estimated  standard  errors,  it  is 
possible  to  calculate  the  probability  of  what  the  effects  of  economic  shocks  on  the  federal  public  debt 
would be in a given confidence interval.

Using  the  same  methodology  adopted  in  the  previous  section  and  the  variables  listed  in  section

policies, on the INSS. Hence, two specifications were considered:

The unit root tests (ADF and PP) indicate that the series in both models are I(1) (see table A.1 – 
appendix).  As  a  consequence,  there  exists  the  possibility  of  a  long-term  relationship  among  the  series 
when  they  are  cointegrated  and  thus  the  models  may  use  the  series  in  levels.  The  tests  denote  that  the 
series in both models are cointegrated12. 

Besides the aforementioned variables in the models, two social variables (GINI and THEIL) were 
included for observing the impact on the INSS. A justification for the inclusion of these variables is that 
an important source of revenue for the National Social Security Institute is the contribution on workers’ 
wages. Therefore, a change in the distribution of wealth can have significant effects on the social security 
deficit. Furthermore, to take into account the effect of the subprime crisis, a dummy variable with a value 
of “1” for the period between  August  2008  and  September 2009 and value of “0” for the other periods 
was introduced in the models. Therefore, the models to be estimated are:

Table 3 presents GMM estimations based on equations (5) to (8). In general, the coefficients are in 
line  with  the  theoretical  arguments.  All  specifications  show  that  the  coefficient  of  the  lagged  INSS  has 
statistical significance and positive sign. Therefore, the inertial effect on the social security deficit cannot 
be neglected. The same behavior is observed for the coefficients of AUX and WMIN.

minimum  wage  imply  a  greater  social  security  deficit.  In  contrast,  the  coefficients  of  the  variables  that 
measure  the  level  of  formality  in  the  economy  (EMPF  and  CT_PO)  show  that  a  decrease  in  the 
informality level contributes to a decrease in the INSS. 

The  coefficients  related  to  the  variables  GINI  and  THEIL  indicate  that  an  increase  in  social 
inequality implies a decrease in  the  INSS. A possible reason for our finding is  that the concentration of 
income  in  Brazil  is  near  the  limit  of  the  social  security  ceiling.  As  the  main  source  of  social  security 
revenue is the income of workers, an increase in the inequality means an increase in workers with higher 
incomes, but  because most of them are below the ceiling, the result is  an increase in  the social  security 
revenues. 

Finally,  it  was  observed  that  the  coefficients  of  the  dummies  are  positive,  which  indicates  that 
economic crises tend to increase the INSS. The explanation for this phenomenon is that crises lead to an 
economic  slowdown  and,  with  increasing  unemployment,  the  social  security  revenues  tend  to  fall.  In 
addition, the increase in the unemployment rates increases social security costs in two ways: (i) workers 
who possess the requirements for retirement, but have chosen to remain in the labor market, tend to retire 
in times of crisis, and (ii) the increase in the unemployment rates tends to increase the demand for social 
security benefits, such as unemployment insurance. 

Taking  as  reference  the  estimated  coefficients  in  the  different  specifications  (see  table  3),  the 
effects  (one  standard  deviation)  on  the  INSS  at  period  t  caused  by  shocks  transmitted  by  explanatory 
variables  at  period  t-1  are  obtained  (see  table  4).13  The  shocks  transmitted  by  AUX  and  WMIN  cause  a 
positive  change  in  INSS  of  3.18  and  3.57  b.p.,  respectively.  In  contrast,  the  results  show  that  the social 
policies that aim to  increase the level  of formality in  the Brazilian economy imply beneficial  effects  on 
the  social  security  budget.  The  shock  on  EMPF  causes  a  negative  change  in  the  INSS  of  5.08  b.p. 
Likewise, the shock transmitted by CT_PO causes a negative change in the INSS of approximately 8.71 
b.p. The shocks transmitted by GINI and THEIL also cause a negative change in the INSS (3.72 and 2.81 
b.p., respectively).

Note: Confidence interval was calculated by Monte Carlo simulation with 10.000 repetitions. 

 

It is important to highlight that if the weighting matrix used in GMM estimation is efficient, the 
estimators are asymptotically normal. Due to the normality of the coefficients and the estimated standard 
errors  (see  table  3),  the  likelihood  of  the  effects  of  economic  shocks  on  the  INSS  being  within  a 
confidence interval was calculated (see table 4). 

 

4.2.3. Equation system: DEBT and INSS 

Based on DEBT and INSS estimations, figure 9 illustrates the interaction between these variables 
in  the  Brazilian  economy.  In  general,  one  can  say  that  in  addition  to  the  direct  effects  of  the  variables 
related to  macroeconomic policy  (interest  and  exchange rates, primary surplus, and average maturity of 
public debt), the effects of the variables that explain the social security revenues and expenditures cannot 
be neglected. Therefore, policies that reduce the social security deficit, as for example, the increase in the 
level of formality in the economy, can contribute to greater public debt sustainability.

One way to test the validity of the models and the coefficients presented in the previous sections is 
to  estimate  them  through  a  system  of  equations  (see  Hallsten,  1999).  For  the  treatment  of  the  potential 
endogeneity  problem  (in  particular,  the  relation  between  public  debt  and  the  social  security  deficit)  the 
use  of  GMM  systems  is  suitable  for  non-biased  estimates.  Hence,  in  order  to  provide  robustness  to  the 
empirical evidence presented in previous sections, the following systems were considered (see tables 5.A 
and 5.B): 
- System 1 

 

- System 2 

- System 3 

- System 4 

- System 5 

- System 6 

- System 7 

- System 8 

where εt ~ N(0,2) and φt ~ N(0,2).

applied in the individual equations estimation). All coefficients of DEBT have signs in agreement with the 
theoretical  argument  and  statistical  significance.  The  exception,  as  observed  in  the  case  of  individual 
estimation,  is  the  MTDEBT.  The  INSS  estimations  also  do  not  show  considerable  difference  from 
individual  estimations.  In  short,  although  the  standard  errors  are  smaller  in  most  of  the  systems,  the 
estimated coefficients have similar magnitudes to those observed for the individual estimations. 

Taking into account the results from GMM individual and systems estimation for the  DEBT and 
INSS, table 6 summarizes the effects of shocks transmitted by the variables considered in the models. The 
results  indicate  that  the  magnitude  of  the  shocks  is  similar  between  the  methods  considered  (individual 
and system). Therefore, the results leave no doubt that management of the social security system for the 
fiscal budget cannot be neglected in order to ensure public debt sustainability.

5. Conclusion 

 

The  empirical  evidence  in  this  study  shows  that  the  financing  of  social  security  is  important  to 
explain the Brazilian public debt. In addition, other variables used in the model (primary surplus, interest 
rates, exchange rates, and average maturity of public  debt) are also relevant. An important result of this 
analysis  is  with  respect  to  the  effects  of  the  social  security  deficit.  The  findings  confirm  that  the  social 
security  deficit  is  significant  to  the  increase  in  the  public  debt/GDP  ratio.  Therefore,  an  efficient 
management  of  social  security,  which  could  reduce  the  deficit,  is  important  for  the  success  of  the 
management of public debt. 

Another  important  issue  that  had  not  been  explored  in  the  literature  on  social  security  was  with 
respect to the effects of income inequality. The empirical evidence in this study shows that a reduction in 
the Brazilian income inequality would imply an increase in the social security deficit. This result deserves 
attention  because  the  adoption  of  measures  to  reduce  income  inequality  is  essential.  Hence,  it  is 
imperative  that  we  search  for  mechanisms  to  mitigate  the  impact  on  the  social  security  deficit  of  the 
successful adoption of social policies. 

It is important to highlight that the results of this study showed that the policy to increase the level 
of  formality  in  the  Brazilian  economy  has  a  strong  influence  in  reducing  the  social  security  deficit. 
Therefore, it is important that the federal government strengthens this policy as a means to improve the 
management  of  the  social  security  system.  Another  important  observation  is  the  increase  in  the  social 
security deficit caused by both the real increase in the minimum wage and the sickness benefit. Therefore, 
these variables have a  crucial role in  the search for an efficient social  security management system  and 
cannot be neglected in ensuring fiscal sustainability.

Appendix 

Table A.1: Unit root tests (ADF, PP, and KPSS) 

Note: Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF) – based on Schwarz criterion, the final choice of lag was made. Phillips-Perron and KPSS test – bandwidth is 

 

Andrews using Bartlett kernel. Based on Schwarz criterion, intercept (I) or time trend (T) was applied. 

 

Table A.2 

AIC, SC and HQ criteria for VAR 

Note: (*) denotes lag order selected by the criterion. AIC – Akaike criterion. SC – Schwarz criterion. HQ – Hannan-Quinn criterion.
