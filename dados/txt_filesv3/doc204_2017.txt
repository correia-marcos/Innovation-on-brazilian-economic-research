Resumo: A expansão regional da agricultura irrigada provoca um crescimento na produção de alimentos 
no país, minimiza os riscos para o agricultor e fortalece a segurança alimentar para as gerações futuras. No 
entanto, tem um efeito prejudicial na disponibilidade hídrica através de demandas de uso de água, o que 
pode  intensificar  situações  de  escassez  microrregional.  O  modelo  TERM-BR  foi  utilizado  para  simular 
cenários de expansão em áreas irrigadas com o objetivo de verificar o impacto no uso da água em 2025. Os 
cenários foram adaptados do Plano Nacional de Recursos Hídricos (PNRH) e simulações foram realizadas 
para áreas consideradas potencialmente adequadas para Irrigação com base no relatório do Ministério da 
Integração Nacional (MI). A agricultura de irrigação foi separada da agricultura de sequeiro em termos de 
produtividade  diferencial.  O  Balanço  Hídrico  Climatológico  (CWB)  foi  estimado  para  os  estados  do 
Nordeste a fim de comparar o abastecimento e a demanda de água regional. Os resultados para o Brasil 
sugerem  impactos  positivo  sobre  o  PIB,  investimento  e  consumo  das  famílias  regionais.  O  resultado 
comparativo  da  CWB  e  do  modelo  TERM-BR  para  estados  na  região  Nordeste  aponta  para  possíveis 
problemas de disponibilidade de água nos estados de Alagoas e Pernambuco, especialmente.

Abstract: Regional expansion of irrigated agriculture causes a growth in food production in the country, 
minimizes risks for the farmer and strengthens food security for future generations. However, at the same 
time,  it  has  a  damaging  effect  on  water  availability,  via  demands  for  water  use,  which  may  intensify 
situations of microregional water scarcity6. The TERM-BR model was used to simulate expansion scenarios 
in irrigated areas, aiming at verifying the impact in the water use for 2025. Scenarios were adapted from 
the National Water Resources Plan (PNRH) and simulations were carried out for areas deemed potentially 
suitable for irrigation based on the Ministry of National Integration report (MI). Irrigated agriculture was 
separated from dry farming in terms of differential productivity. The Climatic Water Balance (CWB) was 
estimated for Northeastern States in order to compare regional water supply and demand. Results for Brazil 
suggest positive impact on the GDP, investment and use of regional families. The comparative result of the 
CWB and the TERM-BR model for states in the Northeastern region point to potential water availability 
problems in the states of Alagoas and Pernambuco in particular.

Introduction 
 

The  irrigated  agriculture  area  has  been  growing  constantly  for  the  last  20  years  in  Brazil.  The 
Brazilian Agricultural Census has registered a total of 1,959,810 irrigated hectares in 1985 and 4,545,532 
hectares in 2006, a growth of 132% during the period. Estimations made by the National Water Agency 
(ANA) report a growth of 46% between 2006 and 2012, approximately 5.8 million hectares that year (ANA, 
2013). Although the advancement of irrigated areas is important for the generation of income and increases 
in food production, the impact on regional water resources has been  causing conflicts in some Brazilian 
regions. Reports from the Pastoral Commission for Land (CPT) show that, in 2013, 93 conflicts were about 
to water use - 37 of them in the Northeast region. In 2015, conflicts for the use of water peaked at a total of 
135 nation-wide, 46 in the Northeast region (CPT, 2015).  

Agriculture is, by far, the greatest user of water resources; it is the main activity for livelihood and 
both direct and indirect employment for the population, and contributes considerably for the national GDP. 
However,  in  Brazil,  taxing  related  to  water  use  is  incipient  and  usage  data  is  not  featured  in  national 
accountability reports, which renders an analysis of water resources with economic models difficult.  

The TERM-BR model was used to simulate scenarios of irrigated hectares expansion proposed by 
the  National  Water  Resources  Plan  (PNRH)  described  in  MMA  (2006a)  and  based  on  areas  potentially 
suitable for irrigation reported by the MI (2014). In order to highlight eventual state-level restrictions to 
water supply, a climatic water balance (CWB) was estimated for the states of Northeastern Brazil in order 
to compare it to the results simulated by the TERM-BR model.  The impact of the expansion of irrigated 
areas on sectoral and regional water demands in Brazil were therefore simulated for 2015.  

The Brazilian territory extends for 8.5 million km² and is organized into five geographic regions 
(North,  South,  Northeast,  Midwest  and  Southeast),  with  26  Federal  Units  (UF)  plus  Federal  District 
(capital).  About  89  %  of  the  Northeast  region's  territorial  extension  is  situated  in  a  semi-arid  region;  it 
constantly  faces  difficulties  related  to  droughts  and  low  regional  development,  having  many  rivers 
classified as being in critical condition due to low water availability (ANA, 2014), which makes it a target 
for a series of regional studies for the formulation of public policies.  

Literature related to  droughts  and climate vulnerability in  the Northeast  is  vast,  especially  in  the 
semiarid region, a focal point of so many socioeconomic and bio-physical studies (Nelson and Finan, 2009). 
However,  adopted  policies  suggest  the  existence  of  limitations  regarding  long-term  analysis,  whereas 
drought-related  vulnerability  remains.  Economic  studies  on  the  demand  for  water  use  in  Brazil  and 
computable  models  of  general  balance  (CGE)  in  an  interdisciplinary  analysis  are  still  incipient  in  the 
country.  

 Therefore,  this  study  intended  to  make  a  contribution  in  the  following  aspects.  Firstly,  the 
elaboration and aggregation of data for the matrix of original water by activity and by region. Secondly, as 
far  as  we  know,  this  is  the  first  time  PNRH  scenarios  by  MMA  (2006a)  are  simulated  in  an  integrated 
socioeconomic frame. Thirdly, a comparison between results for water demand with a regional database of 
water supply, estimated with detailed physical regional information is as yet unheard-of. We hope this paper 
will contribute to the clarification of aspects that are important to the management of water resources in 
Brazil, as well as to setting a path for the future expansion of this methodology for the whole country.  

 

The National Water Resources Plan (PNRH) and Irrigated Agriculture  
 

The PNRH constitutes a strategic set of inter-institutional actions and relations geared towards the 
improvement  of  water  supply,  both  in  terms  of  quality  and  of  quantity,  thus  managing  demands.  The 
PNRH's  strategic  goals  refer  to  (i)  the  improvement  of  water  availability;  (ii)  the  reduction  of  conflicts 
motivated by water usage and critical hydrological events and (iii) the valuing of water as a relevant socio-
environmental good (MMA, 2006a). Four document notebooks were elaborated and divulged in 2006 and 
are integral to the plan. The first volume describes the panorama and the state of water resources in Brazil 
(MMA, 2006b), the second volume presents the plan's scenarios for 2020 (MMA, 2006a), the third volume 
reports the plan's directives (MMA, 2006c) and the fourth volume, national programs and goals (MMA, 
2006d).  

Water resources management is based on territorial sectioning of water basins, and management has 
gained  momentum  in  the  early  1990s  when  the  Dublin  Principles  were  agreed  upon  in  the  meeting  in 
preparation  for  Rio-92  (WMO,  1992).  Thus,  PNRH,  apart  from  considering  the  12  disaggregated 
hydrographic regions into 56 planning units, it also takes into account regionalization in Special Planning 
Situations,  which  constitute  territorial  spaces,  be  they  natural  or  derived  from  usage  and  occupation 
processes that might lead to another sectioning, whose limits need not necessarily coincide with those of a 
water basin (MMA, 2006b). Therefore, the plan takes into consideration the physical, biotic, cultural and 
socio-economical diversity of Brazilian hydrographic regions with regional and national integrations whose 
dissolution is in Figure 1.

Having been implemented after the elaboration and promulgation of the Irrigation7 and Agricultural 
Policies8, the National Policy for Water Resources 9 is not specifically addressed in none of those policies 
(MMA,  2006b).  Even  though  they  already  pointed  out  the  need  for  conservation  and  e  recuperation  of 
natural, draining and irrigation resources, which allowed for the integration between the aforementioned 
policies and the elaboration of the PNRH. The use in irrigation tends to yield the greatest conflicts among 
intersectorial competitive uses because it is the greater use, which evidences the challenges faced by the 
National  System  for  Management  of  Water  resources  (SINGREH),  an  organ  which  coordinates  the 
integrated management of water by means of a complex of public and private institutions (MMA, 2006b).  
Planning, by means of participatory construction of scenarios, implicated companies, governments 
and civil  society organizations. Methodology  for  the construction of  PNRH scenarios abided by several 
procedures ranging  from the retrospective study  of the system,  morphological  investigation, plausibility 
tests of the generated scenarios (MMA, 2006a), which, by their turn, are influenced by future developments 
both national and international. Data harvesting for PNRH shed light on the need to intensify researches on 
water usage in all regions of the country. The northeastern semiarid region is prominent in this sense, since 
it is a region endowed with great biological diversity, where many species of plants, legumes and fruits are 
found in areas susceptible to desertification (Marengo and Bernasconi, 2015). However, in areas susceptible 
to desertification, which comprehend the Brazilian semiarid and its surroundings, more than 80% of houses 
do not have a general water supply network, and circa 40 % are served by waters form streams and wells 
located outside their estates (MMA, 2004).

The growth of world population leads to pressures on the demand for foodstuff, which influences 
the practice of irrigation as one item of productivity control and increase. Despite the fact that irrigated 
areas have increased in the country during the last two decades, they are still relatively small, as can be 
seen in Table 1.

The Midwest region registered the highest expansion, with a 1262% growth between 1985 and 2012, 
influenced  by  commercial  and  agricultural  policies  begun  in  the  1970s,  as  pointed  out  by  Helfand  and 
Resende (2000). Other significant features of said increase are the implementation of a production system 
impelled by specific lines of financing, transportation, irrigation, territorial extension, land cost, which have 
been intensified with agricultural and irrigation policies. The region stands out also for having increased its 
national agricultural GPD participation, from 7.4 % in 1970 to 19.5% in 2009, as pointed out by De Castro 
(2014).  

The advance in irrigated hectares is linked to risk control, and was aided by the advancement in 
system automation. In the states of Bahia and Pernambuco, for instance, irrigated fruit farming has allowed 
for the development of regional hubs of production and export (Correia et al 2001; Leite et al, 2016). We 
also point out that, from the years 2002-2012, Northeastern participation in the GDP averaged about 13.2%, 
and agriculture contributed circa 17.7 % (peaking in 2008 at 19.6 %) (IBGE, 2014). Therefore, Table 2 
presents data related to irrigated hectares by states pertaining to the Northeast region in accordance with 
the country's main sources of statistical information.

According to Buainain and Garcia (2015), public hubs of irrigation are under the responsibility of 
the DNOCS (National Department for Works Against Droughts) and the Codesvaf (The São Francisco and 
Parnaíba Valleys Development Company); they occupied 190.8 thousand hectares (63% Codevasf and 37%

Dnocs),  of  this  total circa  161.3  thousand  hectares  were  used  by  agriculture  in  2013.  However,  the 
Agricultural Census of 2006 in IBGE (2009) reported that Northeast region presented more than 1 million 
irrigated hectares in 2006 and, with the reduction of water availability (ex: pluriannual drought extending 
from 2012 to 2015), the conflicts  numbers motivated by water usage in the region has been growing as 
years go by (Martins and Magalhães, 2015), 

Conflicts  motivated  by  water  use  due  to  reasons  ranging  from  the  threat  of  expropriation,  non-
fulfillment of legal procedures, destruction and/or pollution to access hindrance occasioned by clandestine 
barriers  and  water  course  deviation,  among  others.  Table  3  shows  numbers  the  evolution  of  conflicts 
motivated by  water use in the  states of the Northeast  region  and,  the  families numbers involved,  which 
reached 14,518 in 2010.

Please note that the percentage of conflicts in the Northeast is high in relation to the national total. 
In this sense, the dynamics of Brazilian economy has a direct influence on the increase of conflicts. The 
fulfillment of both internal and external demands is an important factor for economic performance and must 
be associated with a strengthening of the management system for water resources in an economic expansion 
scenario faced with the possibility of increase in conflicts due to an increase in water usage demand (MMA, 
2006c).  
 

Methodology 

Term-BR and the water module  
 

This research uses the TERM-BR  model, an interregional computable model of general balance 
(CGE) of the bottom-up kinds, adapted to Brazil from the TERM model's theoretical structures developed 
for Australian economy (HORRIDGE, 2012). 

The TERM-BR database utilizes mainly tables from the Brazilian Input-Product matrix for the 
year 2005 and  allows for the use of other sources of regional data in  order to  complement  studies. The 
model includes an annual recursive dynamic and a regional representation which, in the present version, 
has distinguished 15 Brazilian regions, 36 sectors plus final demand, 10 kinds of family relations and 20 
kinds of work, classified by salary range. The complete structure of the TERM model database is detailed 
in Horridge (2012) and versions adapted for Brazil may be consulted in the studies of Dos Santos (2006); 
Fachinello (2008); Fachinello e Ferreira Filho (2010); Ferreira Filho and Horridge (2014).  

The evaluation of water usage required adaptations to the TERM-BR model, with new equations 
which separated agricultural  lands into irrigated  agriculture  and dry farming land. Thus, the increase of 
regional  agricultural  production  depends  on  the  growth  of  areas  (irrigated  and  non-irrigated)  and  the 
productivity of cultures in each area. This relation is described by the following equations:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

       

K = SHRi. Ki + SHRn. Kn 
 
In which: 
K=; Total Productivity; Ki = irrigated area productivity; Kn = non-irrigated productivity. 
Equation (1) demonstrates the relation between irrigated (SHRi) and non-irrigated (SHRn) sections 
of land and their respective areas. By expanding the irrigated area (Ki), the total area (K) also expands; the 
use of water resources in regional irrigated agriculture grows in proportion to the expansion of irrigated 
area. Food supply grows more in the irrigated area in relation to the non-irrigated area due to the fact that 
productivity for irrigated culture is higher than productivity for dry farming (non-irrigated).  

        (1) 

 

 

The variation of agricultural productivity, in aggregated terms (dK), depends on both the irrigated 
and non-irrigated sections (SHRi and SHRn), as well as variations pertaining to these sections (shrig and 
shrnig). If productivity in irrigated areas Ki > Kn, it follows that: 

 
Kn = x. Ki  , 0 < x < 1 
 
In which x represents the weighting variable of the non-irrigated area in relation to the irrigated area. 
Therefore,  making  all  necessary  substitutions  and  differentiations,  we  have  in  (5)  the  elasticity  of 
productivity in relation to irrigated land.

Water usage database  
 

The  database  for  the  Brazilian  water  module  required  some  steps  which  involved  the  technical 
coefficients of the MMA (2011) and Lisbon (2010), data from the Annual Industrial Research (PIA) at a 
product level, the Agricultural Census of 2006, the National Research for Household Sampling (PNAD), 
the National Research for Basic Sanitation (PNSB) were used. In tradition, in some cases interviews were 
conducted in companies belonging to specific sectors, elaboration of the productivity matrix and planted 
and irrigated areas per culture and region.  

The  detailed  description  of  the  database  elaboration  per  activity  (industry,  agriculture,  family 
demands and services) may be consulted in Ferrarini et al. (2016). Data for water usage (consumption) in 
millions of cubic meters (Mm³) were adjusted and the result for Brazil and for the Northeast by aggregated 
groups of activity can be seen in table 4.

The amount of water in use for irrigated agriculture is directly linked to the type of culture that is 
planted, as well as the region. The study relied on information on water usage technical coefficients for 57 
cultures which were aggregated (12) and are described in the table of results.  

Climate Water Balance and the Brazilian Northeast 

 

Climate data from the CRU (Climate Research Unit, version 3,2) were employed in order to estimate the 
water balance in the Northeast region. The Thornthwaite and Mather method (1955) was used to derive the 
Climatic  Water  Balance  (CWB)  at  monthly  tipe  steps  and  may  be  consulted,  for  instance,  in  studies 
(Doorenbos  e  Kassam,  1994;  Amorim  Neto,  1989;  Pereira,  2005;  Varejão-Silva,  2006).  The  CWB  was 
estimated for the entire country and annual water surplus or deficit calculated. Therefore, figure 2 illustrates 
the  states  of  the  Brazilian  Northeast  and  the  crossing  between  water  basins  and  states  estimated  for  the 
water surplus in the CWB calculation.

The water demand database was structured at state or municipal level. The annual average water 
surplus estimated from CWB, was aggregated into larger units (hydro-regions) which takes into account 
watershed divisions and state boundaries (figure 2b) and the blue circle represents the interaction between 
basins and states of the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. The water supply at these hydro-regions was 
obtained  from  water  surplus  from  CWB  model  minus  integrated  water  demand  for  the  hydro-region  in 
question  (from  the  TERM-BR  model).  When  the  balance  proved  to  be  positive  (surplus  minus 
consumption), water difference was transferred to hydro-region located immediately downstream. 
 
PNRH Scenarios and closing of the CGE model.  

 

The first step for the simulation was to update until 2012 with data observed for irrigated areas in 
Brazil11.  In this historical  simulation,  it was also  taken into consideration that  the price of commodities 
increases annually 1% faster than the price of manufactured goods, the growth of Brazilian economy in 
terms  of  the  GDP  (Gross  Domestic  Product)  followed  information  contained  in  the  National  Water 
Resources Plan (PNRH). For the SCEN 1  Increase of GDP of 4.5 %, in  SCEN 2 GDP of 3.5% and, in 
SCEN 3 GDP of 1.5%. 

Areas  potentially  suitable  for  irrigation  classified  as  being  of  maximum  interest  for  public 
intervention (MIIP) which was described in MI (2014) have been employed for the distribution of irrigated

hectares regionally simulated. The simulated period ranged from the years 2013 to 2025. Therefore, PNRH 
scenarios were adapted for the current economic context: 

Water  for  all  (SCEN  1):  Agriculture  expands  itself  particularly  throughout  the  Midwest  (Mato 
Grosso  do  Sul,  Mato  Grosso,  Goiás)  and  the  Northeast  (Bahia,  Pernambuco,  Rio  Grande  do  Norte  e 
Maranhão) and North (Rondônia, Tocantins and Pará). Annual growth of 170 thousand irrigated hectares 
with  greater  increment  in  the  hydrographic  region  of  Western  Atlantic  Northeast  followed  by  the 
hydrographic region of Tocantins-Araguaya.  

Water  for  some  (SCEN  2):  Agriculture  expands  throughout  the  Midwest  (Mato  Grosso,  Mato 
Grosso do Sul, Goiás) and North (Rondônia, Tocantins and Pará). Areas that allow an annual growth of 
120 thousand irrigated land. The greatest expansion of irrigated land would take place in the Hydrographic 
Region of the Parnaíba, followed by the Amazon region. 

Water for few (SCEN 3): Emphasis on the production of sugarcane for fuel and cotton for the textile 
industry. Irrigated agriculture implicating an annual growth of 70 thousand hectares. The greatest increment 
of irrigated land would take place in the Hydrographic Region of the Parnaíba, followed by the Western 
Northeast Atlantic.  

Changes in irrigated agriculture is related with the kind of culture, climate and water availability of 
each region. So, the results follow the presupposition that the technical coefficient by culture and hectare 
remained the same throughout the simulation of scenarios.  In the policy closing, the section of irrigated 
land (shrig), by culture and region, is exogenous.

Demand of water in Brazil 
 

Results of the three simulations, which stand for scenarios described by PNRH, are summarized in 
table 5. The model was implemented for the 15 regions of the CGE model, with later emphasis on states 
belonging  to  the  Northeastern  region.  Table  5  shows  results  of  simulations  for  a  few  selected  macro-
economical variables. Change in water usage due to shock of policies is greatest in Scenario 1 (SCEN 1), 
and the macro-economical variable would raise the most in this scenario.

National results for changes in irrigated areas in thousands of hectares (Mha) are consistent with 
goals set out in the PNRH12 and show that the expansion of the area in SCEN1 would reach 2.49 (Mha), 
the greatest impact on water resources of all three scenarios. Family consumption, investments and salaries 
grow  due  to  income  generated  by  the  boost  in  productivity  by  culture.  Expansions  of  irrigated  land 
contribute to the increase in agriculture productivity and average national income.  

Water usage in SCEN1 - “Water for all” - is more intense, and would engender an increase in relation 
to  the  basis  of  +10.56  %  accumulated  in  2025  (a  7,554  Mm³  increase  in  water).  Policy  results  for  all 
scenarios show that the water use in SCEN 1 would have the most  potential of leading to environmental 
problems and restricting access to water in certain regions of the country.  

The  policies  results  would  generate  positive  impacts  on  GDP  growth,  investment,  and  regional 
household  consumption.  The  largest  contribution  to  the  variation  in  real  regional  GDP  would  occur  for 
Mato Grosso state (MtGrosso), of +1.17%, + 0.82%, and + 0.47% for the SCEN 1, SCEN 2, and SCEN 3, 
respectively.  The  positive  impact,  on  regional  GDPs,  is  associated  with  the  productivity  of  irrigated 
agriculture, which would also promote the expansion of the production chain for the sectors of the food 
industry. The simulations suggest that the expansion these areas would generate positive impacts for the 
variation in GDP and investment for all regions and in all scenarios. 

 The irrigation could expand in North region in the states of Rondônia, Pará and Tocantins (ParaToc) 
as shown in table 6. In this case, impact on water usage would be greatest in the ParaToc region (+ 34.07% 
in SCEN1).

12 Policy scenarios for the expansion of irrigated land have taken into consideration the current legislation of the Forest Code (law nº12,651/2012) 
described in MI (2014). 

 
The  advancements  of  irrigated  agriculture  could  generate  income  to  local  farmers,  broaden  the 
irrigation  structure  and  minimize  production  loss.  Mato  Grosso  state  present  the  greatest  potential  for 
expansion of irrigated areas, being the third largest state in the country, with a high volume of fresh water, 
numerous rivers, aquifers, springs, and the planet's largest floodable area (called Pantanal). For this state, 
the simulation results in SCEN 1 show that an expansion of 612,380 hectares,  would raise the water use in 
+92,56% in the first scenario. The main crops in the region are supposed to be corn, soybean, cotton, sugar 
cane, and other farming products. However, the largest expansion in the sugar cane production occurs in 
the states of Mato Grosso do Sul and Goiás. 

The southern region of the country receive surface water by Paraná, Uruguay and Southeast basins. 
With a subtropical climate, the region exerts high economic influence over the country. The state of Rio 
Grande do Sul, for example, is the largest producer of irrigated rice: almost 90% of all its areas planted 
with rice are irrigated and has irrigable areas expansion potential of over 1,500,000 hectares according to 
the MIIP (maximum interest of public intervention). In this sense, the results of three simulations represent 
a small portion of the region's potential for expansion. The culture of rice, soybeans, and other crop products 
would be the ones with the highest potential, especially for rice. 

The São Paulo state also presents good water availability regarding the expansions in the simulation. 
It  has  an  infrastructure  (highways,  hydroelectric  plants,  waterways)  that  favors  the  expansion.  Besides, 
irrigated agriculture is practiced, especially towards the northern and mid-western parts of the state where 
sugar cane, orange, corn, beans, soybeans, and potatoes are the predominant crops. 

The results per crop in the irrigated agriculture is on table 7. Changes in the consumption of water 
resources, especially for the irrigated agriculture in arid and semiarid regions, such as the mid-northern part 
of the state of Bahia; the inland Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará South 
Central  region;  The  south  and  southeastern  parts  of  Piauí  are  strongly  affected  by  the  hot  weather  and 
uneven rainfall distribution.

The sugar cane crop stand out in all scenarios, being an important culture to the country (both for 
the domestic and external markets), provides a series of derivatives, such as sugar, ethanol, and its bagasse 
is used in the cogeneration of energy. In the preliminary analysis of the data, this culture presented a total 

of 6,390,474 planted hectares according to the Municipal Agricultural Production (PAM) in PAM (2006). 
Sugar cane planted area saw a growth of 59% between 2006 and 2015 (10,161,622 hectares in 2015).13  

Therefore, the results of the policy in SCEN 1 would expand the irrigated area of sugarcane in + 
549,342 irrigated hectares, this culture would be the most intensive on water resources, followed by the 
culture of the rice, produced mainly in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Tocantins. The 
state of Tocantins is the largest rice producer in the North region and irrigation is practiced mainly in the 
so-called lowlands or plains of the valleys of the Araguaya and Tocantins rivers.  

The aggregate "other crops", produced in all Brazilian states, represents the largest use of water in 
the state of Bahia, Tocantins, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, and Goiás. This foodstuff 
group  includes  agricultural  crops  such  as  tomatoes,  avocados,  peanuts,  potatoes,  peas,  onions,  beans, 
sunflower, pepper, among others. It encompasses many cultures that are essential for regional development 
and income generation, and it also ensures the supply of foodstuff like beans, peas, and potatoes, which, 
added to the rice crops, are staple foods on the regular menu of the Brazilian population. 

The comparison of water demand as exclusive criteria the water availability does not describe in 
full scale the potential for the expansion of agriculture.  In all regions, require infrastructure investments 
and  expansion  of  the  regional  supply  system  in  order  to  meet  these  expansions  of  water  demand.  The 
Northeast region, except for the states of Maranhão, Piauí and Bahia, did not obtain major expansions of 
irrigated area due to low water potential in the region. Thus, the following session details results for the 
states of Brazil's Northeast and compares these with the estimated water availability from the CWB. 

Effects of the increase in irrigated area in northeastern Brazil over water resources 

 
As stated earlier in this section, here we will discuss in greater detail the results for the northeastern 
region of Brazil, the most critical in terms of availability of water resources. The results of SCEN 114 for 
water  use  was  disaggregated  (user  and  state)  and  the  simulation  were  used  in  regional  water  balance 
estimates. Therefore, tables 8 and 9 present the results for the expansion of irrigated areas by culture in the 
northeastern states and the use of water in million m³.

13 The crop coefficient was estimated on the municipal level by MMA (2011) and the coefficients for sugar cane were check in face of studies 
from  Biswas  (1988),  Doorembos  &  Kassan (1979),  Silva et al.  (2011),  Souza  et  al. (2012),  Carmo  (2013).  No  simulation  results  diverged 
substantially from the results presented by these authors, especially presented from the ones presented by Carmo (2013), which considered the 
semi-arid region of Bahia for the analysis of the crop cycle. 
14 SCEN 1 was used in the comparison for being the scenario of greater impact on water resources. 

For instance, the states of Maranhão, Piauí, and Bahia are the states of greater expansion in irrigated 
agriculture for the region. The potential for expansion would reach more 268,152 and 308,941, and 393,859 
hectare; the simulation represent 15.24%, 14%, and 16.89% of potential. 

The expansion of irrigated area in the state of Alagoas represents 10.23% of the regional potential. 
However, when considering the irrigated area described in MMA (2011), the policy result would lead to an 
irrigated area exceeding the potential capacity for the region, and the impact on water resources would be 
greater than the microregional potential. 

The maximum potential of irrigation considered the MIIP class for Brazil would be of 12,938,220 
hectares and 1,056,424 in the Northeast area, especially in the states of Bahia, Maranhão, and Piauí. For 
Bahia state, the expansion would occur in practically all crops, with emphasis on the Other Crops. Bahia 
offers the most extensive coastline with access to the Atlantic Ocean, and, among the northeastern states, it 
represents the largest territorial extension, the largest population, and the largest gross domestic product. 
Then, the water use as police result by state and crop is in table 9.

Sugar cane and rice crops would expand in Maranhão and Piauí. The regions have presented growth 
in the production of these crops oriented by regional policies that have been supporting the expansion of 
these cultures in the states that are major producers of irrigated rice in the northeast of the country, with a 
planted area of 349.8 and 95.1 thousand hectares in 2014/2015 respectively (CONAB, 2015). Rice in Brazil 
presents an important social role regarding food safety, and the largest irrigated area lies in the southern 
part of the country (90% approximately).  

The use of water in the "Other Crops" aggregate may not represent the regional peculiarities and 
implies  in  the  average  increase  in  water  use  for  all  crops,  which  represents  a  portfolio  of  agricultural 
products essential for economic development. The water use in "Other Crops" would be more significant 
in Bahia and irrigated rice in Piauí. 

Ceará state would be relevant in the expansion of irrigated areas to promote regional development. 
However, the distribution of rainfall that is not homogeneous and some regions present high evaporation 
and low precipitation and / or irregularity of rains, causing the seasonality and limiting access to water. 

The  regional  water  availability  has  been  an  obstacle  to  the  expansion  of  irrigated  areas  in  the 
Northeast. In this sense, a key point in this study was to know the river flow of basins and sub-basins that 
supply the Northeastern states of Brazil. This direction is essential for the water supply estimate and since 
the division  of Brazilian watersheds does not  present  the same geographical  boundaries of states.  Some 
states receive water from other river basins that are catchment areas in other regions (states). In other cases, 
the water catchment area can be the same as that of the supply, which reduces microregional and state water 
availability, such as, for instance: the basins in the states of Rio Grande do Norte (RN) and Paraíba (PB). 
Therefore, the flow can be visualized in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Flowchart of the basins for the states of the Brazilian Northeast region. 
Note: The figure illustrates the flow of river basins toward the northeastern states by basin code, and Figure B exemplifies the 
flow from basins from other state to Sergipe state. 
 

The data from  Figure 4 can be best understood through an example. Considering the case of the 
state of Sergipe, it turns out that it has catchment areas in the states of Goiás (basins 746 and 747), Minas 
Gerais (basin 745), Bahia (basin 743) and in the Federal District (basin 748). Water surpluses of these areas 
were computed following the stream and its estimated feeding to the basins 741 and 743, which belong to 
the state. In order to facilitate te visualization of the stream, the figure 5.B illustrates the particular case of 
the state of Sergipe. As described above, the same procedure was done for the other states of the Northeast 
and shows the differences between the water paths (basins) to the states.  

The results for the estimated water supply were compared with water availability in terms of average 
flow as described in ANA (2007). Some differences have been identified, especially for the Parnaíba basin, 
with  a  ratio  of  2.5.  However,  in  the  case  of  the  São  Francisco  River15,  East  Atlantic,  and  Tocantins-
Araguaya, the result is similar to that disclosed by the agency of waters, with differences of 5% for the São 
Francisco  River  and  East  Atlantic.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  evapotranspiration  and  precipitation  by 
microbasin and river may differ between periods, and the evapotranspiration of reservoirs can also impact 
on the results. 

Two river regions were analyzed for the Alagoas state; the São Francisco River basin (742) and the 
Coastal  Eastern  NE  (731-Atlantic  passage  North/Northeast).  The  Coastal  Eastern  NE  (731)  presents 
shorter rivers, many of them occurring within the state or coming from the state of Pernambuco; i.e., the 
area of contribution is smaller than the area of the São Francisco River (whole). Precipitation in this region 
is greater than at the portion of the São Francisco River that lies within the State of Alagoas, which generates 
a water surplus in 731 higher than that of 742. However, consumption in 731 will also be larger because it 
is the coastal region of the state, where the greatest concentration of population is to be found. 

                                                      
15 The São Francisco River is one of the most important watercourses in Brazil and South America. In 2017, the state of Paraíba began to receive 
water from this river in one of the most important water works for the Northeastern region of the country, the transposition of the São Francisco 
river 

 748 746 747 745 741 753 MG GO BA Regarding the São Francisco River, the water volume of the river is higher (when the whole of the 
river is considered). It receives water from Minas Gerais state (Central-Western Brazil). And so, in the case 
of Coastal Eastern NE/Alagoas region (731), water is consumed and produced in the same region, for there 
is no surplus above or below. In the São Francisco/Alagoas (742), there is a surplus from other river basins 
(744 São Francisco River/Pernambuco) that have been contributing to the surplus in this region. However, 
the average rainfall and the actual evapotranspiration are also higher in the basin 742, part of Alagoas.  

In  this  sense,  table  10  presents  the  estimated  consumption  for  each  basins  that  supply  the 
Northeastern States in the year 2005 and the estimate for 2025, without considering the surplus water from 
other  basins.  Note  that  the  F_B_UF  column  describes  the  fraction  of  the  basin  as  considered  regarding 
supply  in  the  State,  and  the  F_C_Basin  column  for  the  years  of  2005  and  2025  consider  the  water 
consumption in the basin in the state in 2005 and 2025 respectively. 

The same watercourse delimits some states, such as in the borders of Alagoas and Pernambuco (S. 
Francisco River). I.e. the sum of surpluses of 742 (Alagoas) + 744 (Pernambuco) might not be sufficient 
for the water consumption in the region. The water balance calculated the contribution of surplus as state-
level,  and this contribution can diverge  from  the literature in terms  of watersheds. This  problem  occurs 
when establishing a unit that is the mixture of basins and States, which makes it impossible to specify the 
volume of water generated in the regions, but provides an excellent indication of how water distribution 
occurs within states.

Results. 
 

For the State of Rio Grande do Norte (RN) and Paraíba (PB), 734 basins (Coastal Eastern NE/Rio 
Grande do Norte) and basin 733 (Coastal Eastern NE/Paraíba) represent 100% of the basin's share in the 
State. Rio Grande do Norte State to present a semi-arid climate with low rainfall by its seaside, as well as 
high temperatures and dry, constant winds.  

The hydrography of the Northeast of Brazil is considered intermittent and irregular, that is, many 
rivers in the region are subject to changes of the semi-arid climate that, in some cases, become perennial 
or seasonal. The Ceara state presented as a result a low percentage of water usage in relation to water 
availability. However, basin 735 (Coastal  Eastern NE/Ceará), is composed of numerous rivers that are 
poorly  distributed,  and  the  largest  volume  of  rainfall  is  in  the  coast  region,  which  causes  differences 
between water supply and demand in the State.  

In  all  Northeastern  States,  the  water  volume  is  not  evenly  distributed16.  The  interannual  and 
interregional  variability  of  precipitation  over  the  Northeast,  both  in  spatial  and  temporal  scales  which 
diverges at the microregion level and hydrographic basins. The results for Maranhão and Piauí follow the 
same logic of physical and climatic differences in geo-environmental domains, as described for the State 
of Ceara. However, in the cases of Maranhão and Piauí, the high percentage of groundwater supply makes 
an impact over regional supply17.  

When considering the surplus from other basins, the primary change in the results would occur in 
the states of Alagoas and Pernambuco, where the consumption and surplus ratio would be attenuated due 
to the positive result (surplus less consumption) from other regions. In SCEN 1, consumption in the Alagoas 
would be of 50% of the water availability, reaching up to 26% in Pernambuco. Note that water availability, 
even  without  considering  climatic  factors,  changes  between  periods  due  to  the  flow  of  surpluses  that 
changes in each basin .These results can be viewed in table 11.

The result of the interaction between supply and demand. 

 
The  simulation  show  that  the  expansion  would  promote  an  increase  of  water  in  the  Tocantins-
Araguaia  hydrographic  region  (97%).  This  hydrographic  region  also  supplies  part  of  the  state  of  Mato 
Grosso (basin 673) and the state of Goiás (basins 664,674 and 670).  These two states (Mato Grosso and 
Goiás) are located in other regions in Brazil, which according to the PNRH are feasible the expansion of 
irrigation. The Northeastern Atlantic Hydrographic Region should also present a high increase in the use 
of water in CEN 1. This hydrographic region is the main supply region of the states of Maranhão and Pará 
(Northeastern), indicating a high potential for expansion for the irrigation, the increase in this region would 
be 94%. 

The Eastern Northeast Atlantic region is the region that offers the least potential for expansion in 
water use among the hydrographic regions that supply the Northeast of the country. The results showed 
that this hydrographic region, which supplies Alagoas (basin 731), Ceará (basin 735), Paraíba (basin 733), 
Pernambuco (basin 732), Piauí (basin 736) and Rio Grande do Norte (basin 734) Is the region that requires 
greater attention in irrigation expansions. 

Thus, table 12 shows the consumption in 2005 and 2025 for each hydrographic region.

It  should  be  noted  that  the  comparison  of  water  demand  exclusively  by  water  availability  in  the 
region does not, in its amplitude, describe the regional potential for the expansion of irrigated agriculture. 
Regional climate and hydrogeological heterogeneity in the Northeast demand new research. Surplus flows 
showed how Northeastern states are dependent on basins located outside the northeastern region, such as 
the São Francisco River. Changes in water use in some basins that are catchment areas in others regions 
will impact on the volume of water that flows into the Northeast. 
 

Final considerations 
 

The model results suggest that the expansion of irrigated area, especially in the North and Midwest 
regions, are plausible options in all scenarios. Crops of sugar cane, rice and other crop products (including 
fruits) will to benefit the most from this expansion. The scenarios described in PNRH consider regional 
water availability in all situations.  

The most noteworthy effect over water demand would happen regarding sugarcane crops, which, 
with an increase to 549.342 irrigated hectares, would raise the demand for water in 2,940 million m³, being 
the culture that would elevate water demand in Brazil to the highest standards, followed by that of irrigated 
rice, with 1,808 million m³ of water. In regional terms, the expansion in the State of Mato Grosso (+612,380 
hectares) would raise in 92,56% the water usage in the State. 

In fact, the climate and hydrogeological regional heterogeneity, including exploitation and activity 
risks,  requires  oriented  microregional  research.  The  Northeast  region  was  the  region  with  the  smallest 
expansion of irrigated area in three simulated scenarios. However, the impact over water resources in this 
region  is  noticeable,  especially  in  Alagoas  and  Pernambuco  state,  i.e.,  the  water  demand  required  to 
contemplate the whole cycle of irrigated crops in the Northeast, plus the populational growth associated 
with  the  productive  advance,  would  require  increased  availability  of  water  basins,  which  may  not  be 
consistent with the future water supply.  

As an important limitation of the results of this study, attention should be drawn to the fact that the 
analysis of water availability is  restricted, in  fact, to  the regions  served by  the basins. That  is,  there are 
important regions of inland Northeastern states that are not affected by the basins under analysis, or else 
where the balance at microregional level can be very different and possibly insufficient. This is the case, 
for example, of the Northeasters semi-arid region and of the region known as the "Drought Polygon," a 
region  that  covers  1,348  municipalities  that  are  subject  to  prolonged  periods  of  drought, and  strong 
restriction in water supply, composed of geographical areas with different levels of dryness. Our model, 
however, is not sufficiently region-specific to encompass these cases.  

These limitations, if on the one hand show the difficulty of working with the theme of water supply 
in a country as large as Brazil, on the other hand points out the direction future research efforts in the area 
could  take,  since  the  related  uncertainties  are  obstacles  to  the  operational  planning  and  management  of 
natural resources. In future studies we suggest the inclusion of information on climate change and on the 
discharge level changes of rivers in the Northeastern states.
