Abstract:  The  Brazilian  economic  growth  has  been  unstable  and  relatively  low  after  the  1990s’ 
liberalising reforms. Brazil achieved a period of relatively high economic growth from 2004 to 2008, 
but the country has shown difficulties to maintain the previous growth rates after the global crisis started 
in 2008. One explanation for these difficulties is the tendency to an appreciation in the national currency 
that negatively affects the country’s international competitiveness. The aim of this paper is to study the 
impact of the real exchange rate on investment in the Brazilian industry. We develop an investment 
model that considers the effect of changes in the real exchange rate, taking into account that the effect 
of the real exchange rate on the industrial investment is complex. The determinants of the real exchange 
rate can affect differently the demand for the products and the industrial sectors’ competitiveness. The 
composition of these effects varies among industrial sectors, with different repercussions on investment, 
depending on the characteristics of the industrial sector. A panel data analysis is applied to estimate the 
model for the different Brazilian industrial sectors from 1996 to 2010. The main result is that investment 
responsiveness to exchange rate varies among sectors. In short, the results contribute to understand the 
link between exchange rate and industrial investment, unveiling important elements for the debate on 
industrial policy to stimulate investment and manufacturing production growth.

Resumo: O crescimento da economia brasileira tem se mostrado instável e relativamente baixo desde 
as reformas liberalizantes dos anos 1990. O país apresentou taxas de crescimento mais elevadas entre 
2004 e 2008, porém tem mostrado dificuldades em manter essas taxas após a crise global iniciada em

1.  Introduction 

The  Brazilian  manufacturing  production  grew  less  than  the  country’s  GDP  after  the 
1990s’ trade liberalisation reforms, which is quite different an outcome when compared to the 
period of fast industrialization when manufacturing was actually the engine of growth (1930 to 
1980). Despite the low manufacturing growth rate, Brazil achieved a period of relatively high 
economic  growth  from  2004  to  2008,  when  the  world  scenario  was  favourable  (in  several 
dimensions) for the performance of the Brazilian trade balance. However, after the global crisis 
started  in  2008,  Brazil  has  shown  difficulties  in  maintaining  a  high  GDP  growth  and  the 
manufacturing growth rate has lowered. Despite the short period of relatively higher economic 
growth, the Brazilian economic performance was considerably worse when compared to other 
developing economies, such as China. 

One explanation for the difficulties to increase the Brazilian manufacturing growth is 
the  structural  tendency  to  a  decrease  in  the  real  exchange  rate,  i.e.  a  currency  appreciation, 
which negatively affects the country’s international competitiveness. Therefore, investment is 
not encouraged, affecting negatively the country’s GDP growth rate. However, in the period of 
higher  economic  growth  from  2004  to  2008,  investment  increased  despite  the  currency 
appreciation,  thus  reinforcing  the  need  to  analyse  more  carefully  the  impact  of  the  real 
exchange rate on Brazilian investment. 

In this context, the aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of changes in the real 
exchange  rate  on  investment  activity  in  the  Brazilian  manufacturing  industry  after  the 
liberalising reforms. As the (scant) empirical literature on real exchange rate and investment in 
Brazil  has  invariably  been  using  aggregate  data,  this  paper  contributes  to  the  literature  by 
obtaining sectoral estimates of the investment responsiveness to exchange rate fluctuations to 
further  the  understanding  of  the  complex  relationship  between  these  economic  variables. 
Therefore, the paper explores whether there is evidence of an impact of fluctuations in the real 
exchange rate on investment for different sectors of the Brazilian economy. 

The paper is organized in five sections, including this introduction. Section two briefly 
overviews the debate on the performance of Brazilian economy, including the recent discussion 
on the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the country’s investment activity and economic 
growth.  Section  three  reviews  the  empirical  literature  on  the  impact  of  exchange  rate 
fluctuations  on  investment  and  economic  growth.  Section  four  presents  the  equations  to  be 
estimated, the data and the results for the case of Brazil. Finally, section five concludes the 
paper. 

 

2.  Brazilian Evidence 

During  the  Brazilian  industrialization  process,  the  so-called  Import  Substitution 
Industrialization (ISI) period, from 1930 to 1980, the role of manufacturing for the country’s 
economic  growth  was  essential.  According  to  Serra  (1982),  the  country  was  able  to  build a 
much diversified industry that pulled the country´s economic growth. However, the economic 
stagnation, high inflation and the collapse of the public finance during the debt crisis in the 
1980s  reduced  the  Brazilian  State  capacity  to  intervene  in  the  economy  and  the  necessary 
investments  to  keep  the  industrial  structure  updated  were  not  undertaken.  The  Brazilian 
industrial structure, then, got lagged behind those of the industrialised countries at the same 
time  the  world  industrial  production  went  through  important  changes  –  alteration  in  the 
business organization and technological advancements (Belluzzo and Almeida, 2002). Under 

 

2 

this  scenario,  Brazil  liberalizes  its  trade  and  finance  in  the  1990s  as  a  strategy  for  higher 
economic growth, replacing the ISI strategy. 

The  liberalizing  reforms  started  a  new  development  strategy  in  Brazil,  in  which 
international competition has played an important role. According to Laplane and Sarti (1997), 
Laplane et. al (2003) and Coutinho and Belluzzo (1996), Brazil presented important changes 
in  its  manufacturing  production  due  to  higher  international  competition.  Parts  of  the 
manufacturing  production  chain  were  not  able  to  compete  with  cheap  foreign  products  and 
national  production  was  replaced  by  imports.  Moreover,  manufacturing  growth  was  much 
lower  when  compared  to  the  period  of  industrialization.  In  this  line  of  interpretation,  lower 
economic growth was then a result of lower manufacturing growth.  

Figure 1 shows the growth rate for manufacturing and GDP from 1948 to 2010 for the 
case of Brazil, illustrating that Brazil presented much higher GDP growth rates between the 
1950s to the end of the 1970s than from the 1980s onwards. The same feature is observed for 
the case of manufacturing growth, which suggests that the Brazilian industrialization process 
was interrupted in the 1980s. From the 1980s onwards, GDP growth and manufacturing growth 
were slower and more unstable when compared to the ISI period. This feature seems to suggest 
that  the  Brazilian  industrialization  process  was  interrupted  by  the  debt  crisis  and  it  has  not 
resumed  after  the  liberalizing  reforms,  in  spite  of  some  signs  of  better  performance  in  the 
2000’s (until the crisis) when compared to the 1980’s and 1990’s.

The recent debate on the challenges for higher and sustained economic growth in Brazil 
has focused on potential de-industrialization of the domestic economy. Palma (2005) argues 
that Brazil is going through a de-industrialization process due to the new development model 
implemented in the country with the liberalising reforms. Palma (op. cit.), Nassif (2006) and 
IEDI (2007) all identify a process of de-industrialisation as a lower share of manufacturing in 
the country’s GDP or in the total employment as well as changes in the production structure of 
the manufacturing. In the latter, the de-industrialization process would be identified as higher 

 

3 

share of sectors intensive in natural resources vis-à-vis sectors intensive in capital, knowledge 
and technology.  

A  more  recent  debate  stresses  the  problem  of  currency  appreciation  and  favourable 
prices for production and exports of commodity, together with the already existing Brazilian 
comparative advantage in these sectors. Bresser-Pereira and Gala (2010) point out this problem 
and  define  it  as  a  chronic  currency  over-appreciation.  This  chronic  over-appreciation  could 
start  a  process  of  ‘regressive  specialization’1  in  the  production  structure.  The  high 
competitiveness of these commodity sectors would generate excessive  trade surpluses. Such 
surpluses, along with capital inflows, would then appreciate the national currency and increase 
the disadvantages of the manufacturing sector in the external competition. The low dynamism 
of the manufacturing production would then explain the lower GDP growth rate. Accordingly, 
this currency appreciation would prevent Brazil to develop its manufacturing structure,  thus 
blocking the technological development of tradable goods sectors. Additionally, IEDI (2012) 
points  out  that  the  increasing  globalisation  of  the  manufacturing  production  along  with 
misalignments  in  the  real  exchange  rate  are  likely  to  cause  irreversible  losses  in  the 
manufacturing structure of countries with an overvalued currency. 

Sarti  and  Hiratuka  (2010),  on  the  other  hand,  argue  that  despite  the  long  period  of 
stagnation and the interruption of the industrialization process in the 1980s, and decreases in 
the  density  of  some  industrial  chains  during  the  1990s,  the  Brazilian  manufacturing  still 
maintains  a  diversified  structure.  This  structure  is  then  able  to  generate  dynamism  for  the 
economy as a whole. Rocha (2011), in the same line of interpretation, argues that the Brazilian 
manufacturing  showed  resistance  to  the  de-industrialization  process  in  the  period  after  the 
liberalising reforms, thus maintaining the industrial diversification of the economy. According 
to Sarti and Hiratuka (2010), the available evidence is not compelling enough to allow one to 
characterize this process as one of definitive de-industrialization in Brazil and they refer to the 
recent process as ‘interrupted industrialization’. The rationale for this term is that despite the 
long period of low economic growth, Brazil was able to keep a relatively complex industrial 
structure  that  is  diversified  and  integrated,  especially  when  compared  to  other  countries’ 
experiences  in  Latin  America,  and  that  there  was  no  absolute  limit  to  recover  the  role  of 
manufacturing as engine of economic growth, in spite of the challenges posed by changes in 
the global manufacturing scenario.  

The  global  crisis  that  started  in  2008  has  brought  some  further  challenges  to  the 
Brazilian  manufacturing  industry.  Figure  2  shows  the  country’s  GDP,  manufacturing  GDP, 
gross  fixed  capital  formation,  consumption,  exports  and  imports  from  2000  to  2012.  One 
important feature revealed in the figure is that before the crisis, GDP and manufacturing GDP 
increased at the same path; however, after the crisis, manufacturing GDP falls below the growth 
rate of GDP. Moreover, imports have increased since 2006, actually increasing even further 
after the 2008 crisis, to surpass exports. Another important feature of the recent performance 
of the Brazilian economy is that gross fixed capital formation starts increasing after 2003 and 
especially after 2006, when the Brazilian economy was under a positive economic scenario. 
This  increase  was interrupted by the crisis, but  recovered  and  kept  on until  2011, when  the 
signs of stagnation were shown.  

 

                                                           
1 The term ‘regressive specialization’ was suggested by Coutinho (1997). Regressive specialization is understood 
in the Brazilian economy as a decrease in the degree of diversification and integration of the productive system 
with loss of density in several production chains due to higher imports of components and capital goods.

Therefore, the increase in the Brazilian GDP from 2003 onwards seems to be associated 
with increasing consumption as well as exports and gross fixed capital formation, but the latter 
has decreased  after 2011  and imports have  increased considerably. This  increase in  imports 
affects negatively the country’s GDP growth rate and may be associated with the decrease in 
manufacturing GDP.  

Figure 3 shows the growth rate of manufacturing investment2 and the growth of the real 
exchange  rate,  in  which  an  increase  in  the  latter  means  the  Brazilian  production  is  more 
competitive internationally. The figure shows that the growth rate of manufacturing investment 
oscillated considerably from 1996 to 2011, increasing in the period of higher economic growth 
(2004 to 2008). But this growth rate was not maintained after the global crisis that started in 
2008, and the country has presented modest manufacturing investment growth since then.

One  important  feature  presented  in  Figure  3  is  that  the  real  exchange  rate  decreases 
when  manufacturing  investment  increases  after  2004.  After  that,  the  national  currency  still 
appreciates,  but  at  lower  rates.  After  the  crisis,  when  Brazil  recovered  its  manufacturing 
investment  level  existing  in  2010,  the  real  exchange  rate  decreased  again.  Therefore, 
manufacturing investment has increased, despite the currency appreciation, especially in the 
period  2004-2008,  when  the  world  scenario  was  favourable  to  the  Brazilian  economy.  The 
question  is  whether  the  difficulties  to  sustain  the  Brazilian  manufacturing  investment  are 
related to the fluctuations on the Brazilian real exchange rate and to the tendency to currency 
appreciation and which are the main transmission channels. 

 

3.  Empirical Literature 

There  is  some  consensus  in  the  literature  that  the  real  exchange  rate  matters  for 
economic  growth.  Rodrik  (2008)  uses  an  index of  undervaluation  (measure  of  the  domestic 
price level adjusted for the Balassa-Samuelson effect3) to explain economic growth. The index 
indicates whether the currency is appreciated or depreciated, making domestic production more 
expensive  in  dollar  terms  in  the  first  case  or  cheaper  in  the  second  case.  Rodrik  (op.  cit.) 
estimates the relationship between undervaluation and economic growth for several countries 
and the results confirm that a currency depreciation affects economic growth depending on the 
country’s level of development. Moreover, the author also shows that currency depreciation 
has a positive effect on the relative size of the tradable sector, especially on manufacturing, and 

                                                           
3  The  undervaluation  index  is  computed  in  three  steps.  First,  the  real  exchange  rate  is  calculated  using  the 
purchasing power parity conversion factor. Then, the real exchange rate is regressed on per capita GDP to obtain 
the  estimated  Balassa-Samuelson  effect.  Finally,  the  undervaluation  index  is  obtained  by  the  ratio  of  the  real 
exchange rate to the predicted value from the Balassa-Samuelson-adjusted rate. 

 

6 

the  effects  of  the  real  exchange  rate  on  economic  growth  operates  partially  through  the 
associated change in the relative size of tradables.  

Vaz  and  Baer  (2014)  advances  Rodrik’s  (2008)  work  by  providing  a  disaggregated 
industrial sector analysis to investigate to what extent the industrial sectors in Latin America, 
from  1995  to  2008,  have  been  negatively  or  positively  affected  by  the  recent  currency 
appreciation. The authors point out four ways in which the real exchange rate appreciation may 
affect  manufacturing  sectors  performance:  manufactured  goods  become  more  expensive 
internationally; imported manufacturing goods become cheaper; imported intermediate goods 
become cheaper, reducing production costs; and, if such appreciation is due to an increasing 
demand  of  primary  commodities,  the  income  effect  may  raise  the  domestic  consumption  of 
manufactured goods. Vaz and Baer (op. cit.), then, investigate which one of the four effects has 
prevailed in Latin America in the considered period. 

Other studies investigate more specifically the relationship between exchange rate and 
investment. Accordingly, firms make capital accumulation plans described by the following 
implicit investment function: 

gi = gi (α,π,u,e) 

 

 

 

(1) 

where  gi  is  investment  as  a  proportion  of  the  capital  stock,  α  is  a  parameter  describing 
autonomous investment governed by (say) Keynes’ animal spirits and gi
u > 0, where π 
is  the  profit  share  in  income  and  u  is  (capital)  capacity  utilization.  Following  Marglin  and 
Bhaduri (1990), investment depends positively on the profit share. A broader rationale for this 
specification is that, given capacity utilization, the current profit share is an index of expected 
future earnings and both provides internal funding for investment and makes it easier to raise 
external funding. Meanwhile, following Rowthorn (1981) and Dutt (1984, 1990), who in turn 
follow Steindl (1952), capital accumulation plans depend positively on capacity utilization due 
to accelerator-type effects.  

α,gi

π,gi

There are reasonable theoretical and empirical grounds for including the real exchange 
rate,  e,  as  a  separate  argument  in  the  investment  function  above,  even  if  the  sign  of  the 
corresponding partial  derivative, gi
q, cannot  be unambiguously  ascertained. For instance, on 
theoretical grounds, a change in the exchange rate have an impact on the price competitiveness 
of firms (both at home, given the competition of imported substitutes, and abroad, due to the 
change  in  export  prices)  and  on  the  cost  of  imported  inputs.  Yet  most  available  theoretical 
models provide no  clear indication as to  which effect  is dominant,  and the overall effect of 
exchange rates on investment remains an empirical question. The empirical evidence seems to 
be more favourable to the assumption that investment varies positively with the real exchange 
rate, so we assume gi

q > 0. 

 
Goldberg  (1993)  finds  that  a  real  depreciation  (appreciation)  of  the  U.S.  dollar  was 
likely to generate an expansion (reduction) in investment in the 1970s, but that the opposite 
pattern  prevailed  during  the  1980s.  Meanwhile,  Campa  and  Goldberg  (1995)  attribute  this 
difference  in  investment  response  between  the  1970s  and  1980s  to  the  decline  in  industry 
export exposure as U.S. firms progressively increased their reliance on imported inputs. Also, 
they  find  distinct  investment  patterns  across  industries  with  different  markups  ratios,  with 
investment  in  high-markup  industries  with  an  oligopolistic  market  structure  being  less 
responsive to exchange rates. Campa and Goldberg (1999) compare the investment sensitivity 
to exchange rate in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada for the period 1970-
93,  and  find  investment  in  Canada  to  be  the  least  responsive  to  exchange  rate  movements. 
Indeed,  Harchaoui,  Tarkhani  and  Yuen  (2005)  employ  industry-level  data  for  Canadian 

 

7 

manufacturing industries for the period 1981–97 just to find the overall effect of exchange rates 
on total investment to be statistically insignificant. 

 
Nucci  and  Pozzolo  (2001)  investigate  the  relationship  between  exchange  rate 
fluctuations  and  the  investment  decisions  of  a  sample  of  Italian  manufacturing  firms.  The 
results  support  the  view  that  an  exchange  rate  depreciation  rate  has  a  positive  effect  on 
investment through the price competitiveness channel, but a negative effect through the cost of 
imported  inputs  channel.  Expectedly,  the  magnitude  of  these  effects  varies  over  time  with 
changes in the firm's external orientation, as measured by the share of foreign sales over total 
sales,  and  the  dependence  on  imported  inputs.  The  impact  of  exchange  rate  changes  on 
investment is stronger for firms with lower degree of monopoly power (proxied by lower price-
cost margins), facing a high degree of import penetration in the domestic market, and of a small 
size.  Besides,  they  find  evidence  that  the  degree  of  substitutability  between  domestically 
produced and imported inputs influences the impact through the expenditure side. 

 
Meanwhile, Blecker (2007) analyses the effects of the real value of the U.S. dollar on 
aggregate investment in the U.S. domestic manufacturing sector, using annual time-series data 
for 1973-2004. The main result of the econometric estimation is a negative effect that is much 
larger  than  those  found  in  previous  studies.  Moreover,  the  exchange  rate  is  found  to  affect 
investment  mainly,  although  not  exclusively,  through  the  channel  of  financial  or  liquidity 
constraints, rather than by affecting the desired stock of capital. Interestingly, counterfactual 
simulations show that U.S. manufacturing investment would have been 61% higher in 2004 if 
the  dollar  had  not  appreciated  after  1995.  In  an  empirical  study  on  Mexico,  Blecker  (2009) 
finds the real value of the peso to have a positive direct effect on investment. However, this 
effect is offset by contractionary effects that the exchange rate has on Mexico’s growth rate. 

 
In a different approach, Landon and Smith (2006) estimate the impact of exchange rate 
movements on the industry-level price of investment goods using a panel of OECD countries. 
They find that an exchange rate increase (decrease) causes a significant rise (fall) in the prices 
of the investment goods used by most industries. However, the magnitude of this effect differs 
greatly across sectors, with a currency depreciation causing a stronger increase in the price of 
investment  goods  used  by  industries  that  produce  high-technology  products  and  employ  a 
larger proportion of imported capital. As a result, changes in the exchange rate may affect both 
the level and distribution of investment across sectors. 

 
After deriving a theoretical framework to tackle the issue of the real exchange rate as 
an instrument of development policy, Razmi, Rapetti and Skott (2009) test its predicted positive 
relationship between real exchange rate undervaluation and investment growth. Using panel 
data  for  184  countries  with  5-year  time  periods  spanning  1960-2004,  they  find  that  real 
exchange rate undervaluations are (statistically) significant drivers of investment growth, but 
only in developing countries, this result being robust to different specifications, controls, and 
econometric methods. Meanwhile, Bahmani-Oskooee and Hajilee (2010) investigate the effect 
of currency depreciation on domestic investment using a time-series model of 50 countries for 
the  1975–2006  period.  Though  they  find  significant  positive  short-run  effects  of  currency 
depreciation on domestic investment in 43 out of the 50 countries, it is only in 21 countries that 
there are also long-run effects. This latter evidence is inconclusive, though, as a depreciation 
results in an increase in domestic investment in 10 countries, and results in a decrease in the 
remaining 11 countries. 

 
Finally, though it is the level of the real exchange rate which is included in equation 1, 
it is worthy reporting results found in a related literature on the relationship between exchange 
rate volatility (mainly as a source of uncertainty) and investment. Darby, Hallet, Ireland and 
Piscitelli (1999) develop a formal model in which exchange rate uncertainty may or may not 

 

8 

depress  investment,  as  there  are  threshold  effects  which  define  when  rising  exchange  rate 
volatility would increase or decrease investment. However, Atella, Atzeni and Belvisi (2003) 
use a large panel of Italian firms to find that exchange rate volatility reduces investment (with 
a  decreasing  sensitivity  the  greater  the  firm  market  power).  The  intuition  is  that  a  volatile 
exchange rate reduces investment due to its compromising the evaluation of marginal benefits 
of new capital goods. However, Byrne and Davis (2005) estimate the impact of exchange rate 
uncertainty on investment using panel estimation featuring a decomposition of exchange rate 
volatility.  For  a  subsample  of  EU  countries,  they  find  that  it  is  the  transitory  and  not  the 
permanent component of volatility which adversely affects investment. Meanwhile, Ramirez 
(2008),  using  data  on  private  investment  spending  in  Latin  America  during  the  1980–2001 
period, find that the standard deviation of the real exchange rate has a negative effect on private 
capital formation. 

 

4.  Estimation 
4.1.Econometric Model 

In this paper, we use the equations specified by Nucci and Pozzolo (2001) to evaluate 
the  effect  of  exchange  rate  fluctuations  on  investment  for  different  sectors  of  the  Brazilian 
manufacturing  industry.  The  equations  specified  by  Nucci  and  Pozzolo  (op.  cit.)  are 
particularly useful in this context given that they decompose the effect of the real exchange 
rate  on  investment  decisions.  The  influence  of  the  exchange  rate  on  investment  takes  place 
through tradable goods, i.e. goods that are exported and/or imported. In this sense, the effect 
of exchange rate fluctuations on investment decisions occurs through the impact on costs of 
imported input and/or on the revenue of exported goods. Nucci and Pozzolo (op. cit.) combine 
these two effects in their equation for investment in the following way: 

∆It,i = β1∆It-1,i + β2∆St,i + β3χt-1,i∆et + β4αt-1,i∆et              (2) 

where It,i is investment at constant prices, St,i are total sales at constant prices, χt-1 and αt-1 are 
the export and import coefficients, measured in constant prices to avoid the influence of the 
exchange rate on the value of these coefficients, et is the real exchange rate, t is time and i refers 
to the manufacturing firms. Variables are in logarithm so the variation (∆) provides the growth 
rate of these variables.  

According  to  equation  (2),  a  decrease  in  the  real  exchange  rate,  i.e.  a  currency 
appreciation, would make imported inputs cheaper, thus stimulating investment, but at the same 
time it would negatively affect exports by reducing exports revenues. Therefore, firms with a 
high import coefficient would be more affected through the cost channel, while firms with a 
high export coefficient would be more affected through the revenue channel. In our analysis, 
given that our units of analysis are sectors4, the import coefficient also includes imports of final 
goods. In this case, a decrease in the real exchange rate affects negatively investment decisions 
because  the  national  production  becomes  less  competitive  relatively  to  imports  and  affects 
positively  investment  decisions  because  costs  are  reduced.  An  increase  in  the  import 
coefficient, therefore, may represent a reduction in costs and/or an increase in the competition 
with imports.  

Nucci and Pozzolo (2001) also include in the estimated equations the firms’ mark-up, 
to capture their market power. In this case, a high mark-up means that the firm (or sector in our

case)  has  more  favourable  financial  conditions 
competitiveness, and therefore the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on their investment 
decisions would be reduced. To get this effect, the mark-up is defined as: 

to  face  an  adverse 

mkup = (

𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠+ ∆𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑠−𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙−𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑠

)      (3) 

𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠+ ∆𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠

So, the new equation estimated is: 

∆It,i = β1∆It-1,i + β2∆St,i + β3(1 - mkupt-1,i)χt-1,i∆et + β4(1 - mkupt-1,i)αt-1,i∆et        (4) 

The lagged value of mkup is used to avoid the bias induced by possible correlation between 
the mark-up index and exchange rate variations. 

 

4.2. Data and Estimation Method 

Equations (2) and (4) are estimated for Brazil from 1996 to 2011, a period for which 
there are available information for sectoral investment. The data source is the Annual Industrial 
Research (PIA), provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) which 
makes available information for 25 different sectors of the Brazilian mining and manufacturing 
industry. The PIA database is built with the aim of identifying structural characteristics of the 
Brazilian industrial activity structure. The economic activity sectors are classified according to 
the  National  Classification  for  Economic  Activity  (CNAE),  which  standardizes  the  national 
economic  activities.  This  classification  is  used  for  all  economic  agents  engaged  in  the 
production of goods and services.  

Investment  at  constant  prices  is  calculated  by  summing  up  acquisitions  to 
improvements on property, plants and equipment (PP&E), and then subtracting the sales on the 
same account. These three variables are at current prices, so they are deflated using the gross 
fixed  capital  formation  index.  Total  sale  at  constant  prices  is  calculated  by  deflating  total 
revenue with the wholesale price index. The export and import coefficients are provided by the 
National Confederation of Industry (CNI) that calculate these coefficients at constant prices. 
CNI built export and import coefficients in which the volume is analysed and changes in price 
are eliminated. The real exchange rate is the real effective exchange rate index ERPi/Pd, with 
June/1994 = 100, where ER is the nominal exchange rate (domestic currency unit per foreign 
currency unit), Pi is international price and Pd is domestic price. All variables to build the mark-
up variable are provided by PIA.  

The estimation method applied is the GMM panel data developed by Arellano and Bond 
(1991) in order to account for endogeneity of regressors. This method is efficient within the 
class of instrumental variable procedures. GMM estimation is based upon the assumption that 
the disturbances in the equations are uncorrelated with a set of instrumental variables. 

 

4.3. Results 

 
Table 1 shows the results for equations (2) and (4) when lumping all sectors together. 
The estimation of equation (1) is dubbed basic estimation and the estimation of equation (3) 
includes the mark-up.

Table 1: Estimation Using All Sectors of the Brazilian Manufacturing Industry 

 

 

The  results  of  the  estimation  show  that  the  effect  of  exchange  rate  fluctuations  on 
investment is significant in the basic specification only through the import channel. In this case, 
the coefficient is positive (though small), which means that a decrease in the real exchange rate 
(a  currency  appreciation)  affects  investment  negatively.  One  possible  interpretation  for  this 
result is that a currency appreciation stimulates imports of final goods, thus making domestic 
production of these goods less competitive.  In other words, a currency appreciation, despite 
cheapening  imports  of  capital  goods,  ultimately  affects  investment  negatively  through  the 
import  channel.  When  we  include  the  mark-ups  in  the  estimation,  both  coefficients  that 
measure the influence of the real exchange rate on investment are significant, but the exports’ 
channel appears with a non-expected sign.  It is important to note that in both cases,  with or 
without  the  inclusion  of  the  mark-up,  the  coefficients  of  the  impact  of  exchange  rate 
fluctuations on investment are small. 

After analysing the results for all sectors lumped together, we have splitted the sectors 
in two groups, those with mark-ups above and below the mean. It is important to note that in 
general, the sectors with mark-ups above the mean are associated with the mining sector and 
sectors  that  use  intensively  natural  resources  inputs.  Therefore,  sectors  with  high  mark-ups 
(above  the  mean)  are  sectors  that  experienced  very  favourable  conditions  in  terms  of 
international prices in the 2000’s, with more favourable financial conditions to face an adverse 
international  competitiveness.  Therefore,  their  investment  decisions  are  expected  to  be  less 
affected by exchange rate fluctuations. Table 2 shows the results for this estimation.

According to their Mark-ups 

 

 

In fact, the results of Table 2 show that the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on 
investment decisions is significant only for sectors with mark-ups below the mean, as expected. 
As it turns out, sectors with high mark-ups have higher ability to (self-)finance investment, so 
the influence of the exchange rate fluctuations on their investment decisions is not captured in 
the estimation. 

In  the  case  of  sectors  with  relatively  lower  mark-ups  and  ability  to  (self-)finance 
investment, the impact of exchange rate is significant and the imports’ channel again operates 
through  the  competition  with  imports.  In  this  case,  the  importance  of  exchange  rate  as  a 
determinant for investment may have increased due to the higher competition and the increased 
role of China and other developing Asian countries as large suppliers of manufactured products 
in the recent years.

We note in the figure that most sectors are concentrated is the area where the growth in 
the import coefficient was higher than the export coefficient. At the same time, the sectors for 
which the change in export coefficient was greater are, in general, sectors with higher market 
power, i.e. sectors for which we cannot find any influence of fluctuations on the real exchange 
rate on their investment decisions. Most of sectors with mark-ups below the mean have shown 
import coefficient changes which are higher than the export coefficient change, which helps to 
understand why the estimation detects better the import channel. 

The  sectors  with  mark-ups  below  the  mean,  for  which  the  estimations  detect  an 
influence  of  fluctuations  on  the  real  exchange  rate  on  their  investment  decisions,  are  very 
diverse.  Within  this  category,  there  are  both  traditional  labour-intensive  sectors  (clothing, 
footwear,  food  and  drink),  and  medium  (machinery  and  equipment,  vehicles,  electrical 
material,  chemical)  and  high-technology  (electronics  and  computing  equipment’s,  other 
transport equipment) sectors. Moreover, these sectors reduced their share in total investment 
in the period under consideration. Figure 5 shows these sectors’ share in total investment.

Sectors with mark-ups below the mean had a significant decrease in the share of total 
investment.  The  sectors  driving  such  decrease  were  chemical  industry,  food  and  drink  and 
vehicles. However, the diversity of sectors involved permits to conclude that an important part 
of the investment of the Brazilian manufacturing industry has suffered the negative impacts of 
the exchange rate appreciation. The estimations reported here suggest that the exchange rate 
fluctuations seem to be important for these sectors’ investment decisions, but the coefficient is 
small, and the effect of a currency appreciation is related to the competition with imports, which 
discourages investment. This competition may be held responsible for the decrease in the share 
of these sectors in total investment. 

 

5.  Conclusion 

In  this  paper,  we  have  empirically  tested  an  investment  model  that  incorporates 
different  channels  through  which  changes  in  the  real  exchange  rate  are  likely  to  affect 
manufacturing sectors. The determinants  of the real  exchange  rate  can  affect  differently the 
demand for industrial goods and the industrial sectors’ competitiveness. The composition of 
these effects varies across industrial sectors, with different implications for sectoral investment, 
depending on the characteristics of the industrial sector.  

The main results are that the investment responsiveness to changes in the exchange rate 
takes place mainly through imports, especially due to the effect of  currency appreciation on 
imports of final goods. In general, the higher competition with imported products has offset the 
positive effect caused by cheaper imported inputs or capital goods. 

However, the empirical test applied in this paper also showed that the impact of changes 
in the exchange rate was not uniform across all analysed sectors. When we splitted the sectors 
according  to  their  mark-ups  relatively  to  the  mean  mark-up,  we  found  that  the  influence  is 
found in sectors with mark-ups below the mean. These sectors have, in general, experienced 

 

14 

changes in import coefficients which are higher than their export coefficients, and reduced their 
share  in  total  investment  in  the  period  under  consideration.  In  this  sense,  the  estimation 
confirms that for these sectors, real exchange rate fluctuations are an important variable to be 
considered  in  their  investment  decisions,  though this  influence  is  small. For  the  sector  with 
mark-ups above the mean, there was no evidence that changes in the exchange rate impacts 
investment decisions. These sectors are associated with the mining sector and natural resource-
based industries, which have experienced high profitability regardless the level of  exchange 
rate. 

An  important  policy  implication  for  the  Brazilian  case  is  that  an  exchange  rate 
devaluation  could  have  positive  impacts  on  an  important  set  of  industries,  by  inducing 
investment  and  capacity  expansion.  It  should  be  pointed  out  that,  despite  the  increased 
competition for manufactured products with the emergence of strong Asian competitors in the 
global  scenario,  the  synchronized  global  economic  growth  has  mitigated  the  effects  of  this 
process in the Brazilian economy. However, the post-crisis scenario has been quite different, 
with  a  much  more  fierce  competition,  which  makes  it  necessary  a  favourable,  competitive 
exchange rate to foster domestic production and encourage investment. 

To conclude, our results contribute to a better understanding of the connection between 
exchange rate and industrial investment. Ultimately, important elements were unveiled for the 
debate on industrial and employment policies to promote higher growth rates of investment, 
production  and  employment  in  the  manufacturing  sector  in  a  context  where  investment 
decisions both affect and are affected by competition dynamics.
