Abstract 

This study is connected with the literature about exchange rate pass-through effect on inflation for 
developing economies under inflation targeting. The novelty is the introduction of the effect of both 
monetary and fiscal credibility on pass-through. The article addresses empirical evidence, based on 
the  Brazilian  experience,  regarding  the  idea  that  high  credibility  might  reduce  the  exchange  rate 
pass-through  on  inflation.  The  findings  denote  that  although  monetary  credibility  is  relevant  only 
for  pass-through  on  inflation  of  market  prices,  fiscal  credibility  is  an  important  tool  to  reduce  the 
pass-through on both inflation and inflation expectations. 

Key words: pass-through, fiscal credibility, monetary credibility, inflation targeting. 
 

Resumo 

Este  estudo  está  relacionado  com  a  literatura  sobre  o  efeito  pass-through  da  taxa  de  câmbio  na 
inflação  para  as  economias  em  desenvolvimento  no  âmbito  de  metas  de  inflação.  A  novidade  é  a 
introdução  do  efeito  da  credibilidade  monetária  e  fiscal  no  pass-through.  O  artigo  aborda  a 
evidência  empírica,  com  base  na  experiência  brasileira,  em  relação  à  ideia  de  que  a  alta 
credibilidade  pode  reduzir  a  taxa  de  repasse  cambial  sobre  a  inflação.  Os  resultados  indicam  que, 
apesar  da  credibilidade  monetária  ser  relevante  apenas  para  o  pass-through  sobre  a  inflação  dos 
preços livres, a credibilidade fiscal é uma ferramenta importante para reduzir o pass-through para a 
inflação e para as expectativas de inflação.

1. Introduction 

With the growing adoption of inflation targeting framework and due to the fact that the use 
of inflation targeting demands a flexible exchange rate regime, more attention has been paid to the 
exchange  rate  pass-through  on  inflation.  As  pointed  out  by  Minella  et  al.  (2003),  exchange  rate 
volatility  and  construction  of  credibility  has  been  one  of  the  main  challenges  to  the  inflation 
targeting  regime  in  developing  countries.  The  reason  is  that  a  depreciation  of  the  exchange  rate 
erodes inflation expectations and may result in non-fulfillment of inflation targets. 

The idea above is close to the definition of credibility presented by Svensson (1993). That is, 
there is credibility in the case that market agents believe that the future inflation will fall within the 
target  range.  However,  this  is  only  one  side  of  the  coin  for  analyzing  the  effects  of  credibility  on 
inflation under inflation targeting. The other side of the coin is the fiscal credibility. As pointed out 
by Mishkin (2000), a disadvantage of the inflation targeting for the case of developing economies is 
that it cannot prevent fiscal dominance, and that the exchange rate flexibility required by inflation 
targeting might cause financial instability. In particular, the risk of monetization of the public debt 
is  relevant  under  an  inflation  targeting  environment  because  it  can  start  an  inflationary  process 
(Mishkin and Savastano, 2001).  

It is important to highlight that fiscal credibility is directly connected with the sustainability 
of  public  debt.  An  important  condition  is  that  public  debt/GDP  ratio  does  not  jeopardise  the 
intertemporal fiscal solvency. Hence public debt management plays a crucial role in this system.1 A 
high  public  debt  increases  the  temptation  of  government  to  repudiate  its  debt  and  thus  wrecks 
credibility.  In  short,  low  fiscal  credibility,  as  well  as  low  monetary  credibility,  put  in  doubt  the 
public’s belief that inflation will converge to the target. 

This study is a contribution to the literature on exchange rate pass-through effect on inflation 
for developing economies under inflation targeting. The novelty is the introduction of the effect of 
both monetary and fiscal credibility on pass-through. The main idea is that a high credibility might 
reduce  the  exchange  rate  pass-through  on  inflation.  With  this  objective,  this  article  addresses 
empirical evidence based on the Brazilian experience.  
 
The  analysis  on  Brazil  (the  largest  Latin  American  economy)  fits  well  for  analyzing  the 
effect of fiscal and monetary credibility due to the fact that there exists recent empirical evidence on 
the  significance  of  the  exchange  rate  pass-through  for  inflation  (see  Choudhri  and  Hakura,  2006; 
and  Giannellis  and  Koukouritakis,  2013).  Furthermore,  the  Brazilian  economy  is  still  building 
monetary and fiscal credibility (see Minella et al., 2003, de Mendonça, 2007, and de Mendonça and 
Machado, 2013).  
 
Empirical evidence is a result of several estimations, based on the structural model adopted 
by Central Bank of Brazil (CBB), using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Generalized Method of 
Moments (GMM) for the period from November of 2001 to September of 2013. Due to the fact that 
there are credibility indices that are compatible with the above-mentioned idea and that they were 
applied to the Brazilian economy, we take as reference the monetary credibility index developed by 
de Mendonça (2007) and de Mendonça and de Guimarães e Souza (2009), and the fiscal credibility 
index proposed by de Mendonça and Machado (2013). It is noteworthy that besides the analysis for 
the  pass-through  on  inflation,  we  also  consider  the  effect  on  inflation  of  market  prices  and 
administered prices. Furthermore, we extended the analysis for observing the effect of credibility on 
exchange rate pass-through and then on inflation expectations. 
 
The results provided from this study denote that contrary to Reyes’s (2007) suggestion that 
the  adoption  of  inflation  targeting  reduces  the  exchange  rate  pass-through  on  inflation;  the  pass-
through  is  significant  in  the  Brazilian  economy  after  more  than  ten  years  of  adoption  of  inflation 
targeting.  Regarding  the  effect  due  to  credibility,  the  main  result  is  that  although  monetary 
credibility is relevant only for pass-through into market prices, fiscal credibility is an important tool

to reduce the pass-through on both inflation and inflation expectations. In short, the results could be 
of help for academics and policy-makers in developing economies. 
 
The  remainder  of  this  study  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  explores  the  relationship 
between  exchange  rate  pass-through  and  credibility.  Section  3  presents  the  methodology  and  data 
used in the study. Section 4 provides empirical evidence, through an econometric analysis, from the 
effect  of  monetary  and  fiscal  credibility  on  exchange  rate  pass-through  effect  taking  into  account 
inflation  (also  market  prices  and  administered  prices)  and  inflation  expectations.  Section  5 
concludes the article.  

2. Exchange rate pass-through and credibility 

 
The transmission of the variations in the exchange rate for inflation is a problem particularly 
observed  in  the  developing  economies  which  experience  high  inflation  rate  and  episodes  of 
currency crises (Goldfajn and Werlang, 2000). Some authors such as Calvo and Reinhart (2002) and 
Choudhri and Hakura (2006), provide evidence that changes in import prices due to variations in the 
exchange  rate  are  passed  on  to  domestic  prices  in  developing  countries  more  so  than  developed 
countries.  
 
Several studies have been shown that the exchange rate pass-through on inflation has been 
decreasing  for  developing  countries  with  inflation  targeting.2  Reyes  (2007),  in  a  comprehensive 
analysis  on  exchange  rate  pass-through  effects  and  inflation  targeting  in  developing  countries, 
highlights that one reason behind the declining of pass-through effects is the stronger credibility of 
the central bank’s commitment towards achieving low inflation rates.3 In particular, as observed by 
Eichengreen (2002), in the case of lacks of credibility, sharp changes in exchange rates  will make 
firms not reduce price increases to meet the inflation target.  
 
Inflation  targeting  countries  with  low  monetary  policy  credibility  cannot  neglect  the 
exchange rate pass-through for inflation. Currency devaluations can put in doubt the capacity of the 
central bank to achieve the inflation target creating frequent revisions  in the inflation expectations 
and  thus  damaging  the  development  of  monetary  credibility.4  This  difficulty  to  develop  monetary 
credibility is due to the distrust of the market regarding the conduct of monetary policy (Nogueira 
Jr. and Léon-Ledesma, 2011). Hence, one assumption that deserves attention is that an increase of 
monetary credibility reduces the exchange rate pass-through on inflation. 
 
In  Brazil,  such  as  other  developing  countries  (for  example,  Chile  and  Poland),  inflation 
target is announced by the government and central bank jointly as a manner for the government to 
commit  to  the  fiscal  discipline  needed  to  achieve  the  target.  In  short,  inflation  targeting  must  be 
supported  by  reinforcement  of  fiscal  institutions  as  a  way  of  delivering  better  fiscal  outcomes 
(Eichengreen, 2002). 
 
When  the  percentage  of  public  debt  indexed  to  the  exchange  rate  is  high,  the  effect  of 
currency  devaluation  on  the  public  debt/GDP  ratio  can  put  in  doubt  the  public  debt  sustainability 
(de Mendonça and Machado, 2013). Furthermore, a high public debt/GDP ratio increases the risk of 
public  debt  default  that,  combined  with  low  fiscal  policy  credibility,  increases  the  likelihood  of 
fiscal deficits to be monetized. Hence, high public’s inflation expectations will follow and can cause 
an inflation targeting regime to break down (Mishkin and Savastano, 2001).  
 
In  a  general  way,  public  debt  management  has  the  objective  of  efficiently  meeting 
government  borrowing  requirements  at  the  lowest  possible  long-term  financing  cost,  while 
maintaining  prudent  risk  levels  (ABP,  2012).  With  this  objective  the  Brazilian  National  Treasury 
has adopted an issuance  strategy  of gradually replacing bonds indexed to  the Selic rate (Financial

Léon-Ledesma (2009), and Odria, Castillo, and Rodriguez (2012). 
3 Before Reyes (2007), Gagnon and Ihrig (2004) suggested that decreased pass-through observed in several countries is 
a result of a greater credibility of central banks in maintaining low inflation.

D  –  NTN-D)  with  fixed  rate  bonds  (National  Treasury  Bills  –  LTN  and  National  Treasury  Notes 
Series  F  –  NTN-F)  and  inflation-linked  bonds  (National  Treasury  Notes  Series  B  –  NTN-B  and 
National Treasury Notes Series B -NTN-C) – see figure 1. For improving the market’s perception of 
public debt management for purposes of protection against exchange volatility, since 2002 CBB and 
Brazilian  National  Treasury  have  carried  out  exchange  swap  operations  conjugated  with  primary 
offers of LFT. This strategy has been intensified after the subprime crisis for mitigating the external 
vulnerability. 
There is  a trade-off in  the strategy  adopted by the  Brazilian fiscal  authority.  On one hand, 
 
the  change  in  the  public  debt  composition  reduced  the  sensitivity  of  the  public  debt/GDP  ratio  to 
currency devaluations. However, there is a cost for the management of the public debt that cannot 
be  ignored.  An  increase  in  the  inflation  increases  the  public  debt  due  to  inflation-linked  bonds 
(NTN-B  and  NTN-C).  Furthermore,  there  is  an  additional  cost  when  the  monetary  authority 
increases the interest rate for controlling inflationary pressure due to bonds indexed to the interest 
rate (LFT). 
 
The strategy of eliminating issue of bonds  indexed to  exchange rate (NTN-D) implies that 
currency  devaluation  does  not  affect  directly  the  public  debt.  However,  under  low  monetary  and 
fiscal  credibility, currency  devaluations  are transmitted to  (domestic) inflation.  As a consequence, 
public debt is affected through inflation-linked bonds (NTN-B and NTN-C). Moreover, public debt 
is also affected by an increase in the interest rate for controlling inflationary pressure due to LFTs. 
In  short,  although  the  new  composition  of  the  public  debt  has  reduced  directly  the  exposition  to 
exchange rate, it is not sufficient to eliminate the indirect effect caused by an increase in inflation 
due to currency devaluation.

Therefore,  low  credibility  of  the  economic  policy  (monetary  and  fiscal)  amplifies  the 
vulnerability  of  inflation  target  countries  for  external  shocks  on  inflation.  Low  monetary  policy 
credibility creates inflation expectations greater than the target. As a result, central bank increases 
the  interest  for  the  convergence  of  the  inflation  expectations  to  the  inflation  target  (de  Mendonça 
and de Guimarães e Souza, 2009). Another point that cannot be neglected in an inflation targeting 
framework  is  that  the  low  fiscal  policy  credibility  can  generate  the  fiscal  dominance  problem. 
According  to  Sargent  (1994),  when  the  monetary  policy  is  submitted  to  a  government  that  is  not 
committed  to  fiscal  balance,  persistent  public  budget  deficits  are  a  consequence.  Therefore,  as 
pointed  out  by  Mishkin  and  Savastano  (2001)  the  possibility  of  monetization  of  the  public  debt 
increases creating high inflation expectations and thus a possible loss of control on inflation.

The measurement of monetary and fiscal credibility is crucial for the objective of this study. 
In the last  years, the literature has presented advances in  the measurement  of the monetary policy 
credibility based on Cukierman and Meltzer (1986), Agénor and Taylor (1992, 1993), and Svensson 
(1993,  2000)  argue  that  credibility  indices  can  be  built  through  deviations  of  inflation  from  the 
target.5 
 
For the purpose of analyzing the Brazilian case, the monetary credibility index presented by 
de Mendonça and Galveas (2013), an update of that developed by de Mendonça (2007), is useful for 
this analysis due to the fact that it considers the public’s forward-looking behavior on inflation. In 
other  words,  this  monetary  credibility  index  (CREDM)  is  a  useful  tool  for  measuring  the  public’s 
trust on the capacity of the monetary authority to reach the inflation target. According to this view, 

the credibility is maximum when the inflation expectation for the next 12 months (

) is 

equal to the weighted inflation target (next 12 months - 

) and decreases in a linear way while 

inflationary  expectation  deviates  from  this  target.  When  the  inflation  exceeds  the  bounds  of  the 
tolerance interval,  the  CREDM is  equal  to 0.  Therefore,  based on information available from  CBB 
(Time Series Management System) the scale of the index is from 0 to 1. Hence, CREDM is a result 
of: 

(1)       

 

where: 

is  the  limit  of  tolerance  interval  inflation  defined  for  the  next  year; 

  is  the 

inflation target for the next year.   

Figure  2  shows  that  the  monetary  credibility  presents  three  phases.  The  first  phase  (2001-
2004) is marked by a low performance that is a result of the presidential election in late 2002. Luis 
Inácio Lula da Silva (the winner of that election) promised to change the macroeconomic policy in 
Brazil  (based  on  flexible  exchange  rate,  inflation  targeting,  and  primary  surplus  target)  and  the 
result  was  a  confidence  crisis  in  the  market.  The  second  phase  (2005-2009)  has  the  best 
performance.  The  combination  of  abundance  of  international  liquidity,  absence  of  significant 
external  shocks transmitted to  the Brazilian economy,  and fiscal  responsibility helped CBB in  the 
task  of  using  inflation  targeting  as  a  nominal  anchor.  The  third  phase  (2010-2013)  presents  a 
decreasing  trend.  This  phase  is  a  result  of  the  lagged  effects  caused  by  the  subprime  crisis.  The 
adverse scenery (low world economic growth), low economic growth of the Brazilian economy, use 
of  fiscal  expansionist  fiscal  policy,  decrease  in  international  liquidity  and  thus  consequent  risk  of 
increasing  of  the  exchange  rate  pass-through  on  inflation,  resulted  in  a  negative  environment  for 
CBB guiding inflation expectations.

Monetary credibility 

 

 
Based  on  information  available  from  CBB  (Time  Series  Management  System),  the  main 
variable  used  for  building  the  fiscal  credibility  index  (CREDF)  is  the  net  public  debt  (%  GDP)  – 
DEBT.6  The  reason  for  using  this  indicator  is  due  to  the  fact  that  in  Brazil  it  is  used  by  the 
government as a reference for economic policy decisions (Silva, Carvalho, and Medeiros, 2010). In 
addition, taking into consideration the period under analysis (2001-2013) net public debt (% GDP) 
is highly correlated with gross public debt (% GDP) (see figure 3). 
Such  as  considered  for  the  monetary  credibility  index,  CREDF  takes  into  account  the 
 
public’s  expectations.  This  study  makes  use  of  the  fiscal  credibility  index  developed  by  de 
Mendonça and Machado (2013) that measures the expectations regarding government commitment 
with  public debt  sustainability using as  reference  IMF’s recommendation and Maastricht limits  to 
public debt. This point is important for this analysis due to the fact that macroeconomic weakness 
erodes inflation expectations and the possible result is an increase in the exchange rate pass-through 
on inflation.

items, international reserves (assets) and the monetary base (liabilities)” (Silva, Carvalho, Medeiros, 2010, p. 92).

credibility) to  1 (full credibility).  CREDF is  0  when  market’s expectations for the next  12 months 
(Et(DEBTt+12)) are  greater than the upper limit  (60%) and thus  it represents  a case of high risk of 
default. CREDF is 1 when market’s  expectations for the next  12 months are lower than the lower 
limit (40%) and thus there is no risk of default. CREDF has value between 0 (near the higher limit - 
DEBTMax) and 1 (near the lower limit - (DEBTMin) when the market’s expectations for the next 12 
months are between the limits. Hence CREDF is a result of:

Figure 4 shows the fiscal credibility path over time. In a general way, after the problems due 
to the Brazilian presidential election in 2002, the index presents strong performance and after 2007 
stabilizes around the maximum. As suggested by de Mendonça and Machado (2013), one reason for 
this  good  performance  was  a  sound  fiscal  policy  that  implied  a  fall  in  the  Treasury  bond  risk 
premium due to the increased investor confidence (Brazil received investment grade in May 2008).

Fiscal credibility 

 

A possible doubt regarding the fiscal credibility is in regard to the limits used in the index. 
As  a  manner  of  giving  robustness  to  the  previous  analysis,  the  result  of  fiscal  credibility  index  is 
observed  by  changing  the  limits.  With  this  purpose,  the  lower  limit  is  reduced  to  30%  while  the 
higher limit is increased to 70%. The performance of the adjusted fiscal credibility index (CREDAF) 
is presented in figure 5. Such as observed for the CREDF, the CREDAF path presents a positive trend 
confirming the previous result. However, through CREDAF path it is possible to see that the effect 
caused by subprime crisis was responsible for stopping the positive trend between 2009 and 2010.

Adjusted fiscal credibility 

 

 
As found in most of the literature on the exchange rate pass-through for inflation, this study 
takes in to account external shocks based on Phillips curve.7 There is evidence that hybrid Phillips 
curve  is  most  adequate  to  explain  the  Brazilian  inflation  behavior  after  adoption  of  inflation 
targeting. The justification for the use of this type of Phillips curve is that it is more appropriate to a 
transition  environment  where  the  public’s  expectations  are  not  consolidated.8  It  is  important  to 
highlight  that  in  an  environment  of  low  credibility  there  exists  a  propensity  to  backward-looking 
behavior. On the other hand, when the credibility is high, public’s inflation expectations converge 
to the target. In brief, both observed inflation and inflation expectations are relevant to an economy 
that  needs  to  consolidate  its  credibility.  Hence,  the  version  of  the  Phillips  curve  in  this  study  is 
based  on  the  structural  model  adopted  by  CBB  when  inflation  targeting  was  adopted  in  June  of 
1999 (see Bogdanski, Tombini, and Werlang, 2000).  Therefore, the baseline model to observe the 
exchange rate pass-through for inflation is:

where: t ~ N(0,2); 

 

  -  is  the  inflation  accumulated  in  12  months  (measured  by  National  Consumer  Price  Index 

(extended) – IPCA - official price index); 

Et(INFt+12) – is the market expectations (average) on inflation accumulated over the next 12 months 
(measured by IPCA); 

GAP – is the output gap and corresponds to the difference between GDP accumulated in the last 12 
months (valuated by the IGP-DI in the month) and the potential output (Hodrick-Prescott filter); 
WPI – is the wholesale price index (USA);  

EX – is the exchange rate - United States dollar (purchase); and 
(WPI+EX) - considers the pass-through of exchange rate changes to domestic inflation.

expected that high monetary credibility will protect inflation expectations from the effect caused by 
currency  devaluations.  In  a  similar  way,  high  fiscal  credibility  implies  that  currency  devaluations 
will not put in risk the public’s expectations on the sustainability of the public debt and thus there is 
no influence on inflation expectations. Therefore, high credibility can avoid the exchange rate pass-
through  on  inflation.  With  the  intention  of  evaluating  the  effect  caused  by  monetary  and  fiscal 
credibility on pass-through, the following models are considered:

Due to the fact that the Brazilian economy was hit by important shocks over the period, one 
other analysis is  made taking into  account the  equations above also  considering the presence of a 
dummy  variable  (shocks)  which  includes  the  two  main  shocks  in  the  period.  In  specific:  (i)  the 
market instability due to the presidential election in late 2002 caused by the announcement that Luís 
Inácio Lula da Silva that would introduce important changes to the macroeconomic policy; and (ii) 
the  effects  from  the  subprime  crisis  that  hit  the  economy  in  the  last  quarter  of  2008.  Hence,  a 
dummy variable  is  introduced in  the model and  it  assumes value “1”  for the periods July 2002 to 
June 2003 and October 2008 to September 2009, and the value “0” otherwise. 

It is important to highlight that the term CREDit (where i is M or AF) makes the coefficient 
of exchange rate pass-through for inflation dependent on the monetary credibility. In the case where 
the credibility is improving (score  approaching 1), then the total pass-through coefficients α10+α11 
(equation  4),  α16+α17  (equation  5),  and  α22+α23+α24  (equation  6)  is  less  than  α10,  α16,  and  α22, 
respectively (assuming α11, α17, and α23+α24<0). Contrary to this, when the credibility is worsening 
(score approaching 0), the total pass-through coefficient is greater than α10, α16, and α22.  

It is important to highlight that there is considerable difference in the behavior of the prices 
in  the  Brazilian  economy  (see  figure  6).  In  a  general  way,  the  prices  can  be  divided  into  market 
prices  (prices  defined  by  market  force)  or  administered  prices  (prices  defined  by  contracts  and 
prices which are monitored depending on previous government authorization). Administered prices 
are slightly sensitive to  the market  forces, as for example energy prices.9 Furthermore, there is  an 
inertial effect in administered prices due to the fact that contracts consider the past variation of price 
indices. As a consequence, it is important to evaluate if the observed effects due to exchange rate 
pass-through on inflation rate (full IPCA) are also observed for the case of inflation of market prices 
and administered prices. In this sense, equations (4), (5), and (6), including variations with dummy 
(shocks),  are  estimated  for  both  market  prices  and  administered  prices  as  dependent  variables, 
respectively.

Based on the fact that inflation expectations have a fundamental role in an environment of 
inflation targeting, credibility can be an important mechanism for reducing the impact of exchange 
rate pass-through effect on inflation expectations. In this sense, an exercise is made as a manner of 
evaluating if the observed effects due to exchange rate pass-through on inflation are also observed 
for the case of inflation expectations. Therefore, equations (3), (4), (5), and (6) are rewritten for this 
purpose in the following manner:

In  addition,  such  as  made  in  the  previous  cases,  the  analysis  regarding  the  pass-through 
effect on inflation expectations is also extended with the inclusion of the main shocks observed in 
the period (dummy shocks). 
 
Taking  into  account  the  availability  of  information  from  CBB,  the  data  in  this  study  has 
monthly frequency for the period from November of 2001 to September of 2013 (143 observations - 
descriptive statistics are presented in table A.1 - appendix). As usual, the use of time series data in 
estimations demands the need to check whether the series have unit root (non-stationary data series) 
as  a  way  of  avoiding  the  possibility  of  spurious  regression.  Therefore,  Augmented  Dickey–Fuller 
(ADF),  Dickey-Fuller  Test  with  GLS  Detrending  (DF-GLS),  and  Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-
Shin (KPSS) are performed. The results reveal that all series are I(0) (see table A.2 – appendix).10 
 
Due to the fact that the methods OLS and GMM allow one to see the statistical significance 
and the sign of each coefficient on each variable in the empirical model, they are used in order to 
make  the  estimations.  As  a  consequence,  it  is  easy,  making  use  of  these  methods,  to  identify  the 

                                                           
10 Taking into account the three tests, at least two indicate that the series under analysis is I(0).

Although  OLS  estimator  is  useful  for  our  objectives  it  is  largely  well-known  that  the 
 
estimated coefficients are not reliable in the presence of serial autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, or 
nonlinearity  (see  Greene,  1993).  In  particular,  heteroskedasticity  problem  is  common  in 
macroeconomic time series and there is a risk of endogeneity problem when the credibility effects 
on pass-through are included in the Phillips curve models. Hence, the use of GMM estimator having 
overriding restrictions is a more efficient estimator than OLS (see Wooldridge, 2001). In this sense, 
all  GMM  estimations  take  into  account  the  results  from  J-test  as  a  manner  of  guaranteeing  the 
validity  of  the  overriding  restrictions.  Moreover,  the  instrument  variables  considered  in  the 
regressions are the lagged independent variables. 

4. Empirical evidence 

 
In a general way the coefficients on the variables in the estimations are in consonance with 
theoretical  perspective.  Both  OLS  and  GMM  estimations  for  all  models  in  table  2  show  that  the 
coefficient  on  INFt-1  is  positive  and  significant,  and  on  INFt-2  is  negative  and  significant.  As  a 
consequence, persistence of inflation (inertial effect) is not observed  after the adoption of inflation 
targeting.  This  observation  is  confirmed  with  the  fact  that  inflation  expectations  are  relevant  for 
explaining  inflation  (statistical  significance  in  all  models).  Hence,  the  results  are  in  line  with  the 
argument  that  the  forward-looking  behavior  of  economic  agents  is  crucial  for  the  success  of 
inflation targeting. Furthermore, the focus on inflation is also detected.  The coefficients on output 
gap are not significant, and thus indicate that the CBB is not contaminated with an inflation bias.  
 
Regarding the exchange rate pass-through effect on inflation, the results in table 1 allow one 
to  see  that  the  coefficients  on  (WPI+EX)  are  positive  and  have  statistical  significance  for  all 
models,  and  thus  this  effect  cannot  be  neglected  in  the  Brazilian  economy.  The  possible  benefits 
caused  by  a  greater  monetary  credibility  on  the  reduction  of  the  pressure  of  exchange  rate  pass-
through effect on inflation are not observed (coefficients without statistical significance and the sign 
is not clear). In contrast, although the coefficients on the fiscal credibility effect are not significant, 
the sign is negative for all models. This result suggests that the development of fiscal credibility can 
be an important ally to reduce the negative consequences due to the exchange rate pass-through. 
In order to check if the results observed for the case of inflation (full) are also observed for 
 
the case of inflation of market prices (non-monitored prices) new estimations are presented in table 
2. The sign of the coefficients of the variables present in the Phillips curve are in accordance with 
the  theoretical  view.  The  main  difference  in  comparison  with  the  case  of  inflation  (full)  is  that 
inflation  expectations  are  not  significant  and  the  output  gap  becomes  significant  for  the  case  of 
inflation of market prices.  
 
In specific for the exchange  rate pass-through effect,  different  from the previous case  (full 
inflation),  statistical  significance  is  not  observed.  Furthermore,  one  other  point  that  cannot  be 
neglected is due to the fact that in the case of inflation of market prices an increase in the monetary 
credibility (coefficient are negative for all models and there exists significance in GMM models) is 
a better mechanism than fiscal credibility (coefficients are not significant in any model and the sign 
is not clear) for mitigating the exchange rate pass-through effect.

considering  the  case  of  inflation  measured  by  administered  prices  (monitored  prices). 
The results in table 3 reveal that the coefficients on inflation and inflation expectations 
do  not  present  a  considerable  difference  from  those  observed  for  inflation  of  market 
prices.  Contrary  to  the  previous  case,  the  coefficients  on  output  gap  are  positive  and 
significant.  A  possible  explanation  for  this  observation  is  that  monitored  prices  are 
subject  to  some  control  by  the  Brazilian  federal  government  through  important 
corporations  such  as  Petrobras  (semi-public  Brazilian  multinational  energy)  and 
Eletrobras  (government  owns  more  than  50%).  In  other  words,  the  Brazilian  federal 
government is using administered prices to control inflation. 
 
Putting the focus on the exchange rate pass-through effect, the case of inflation 
of administered prices is near that observed for full inflation (although coefficients are 
not  significant  for  all  models,  the  sign  of  them  are  positive).  A  justification  for  the 
sensitivity of administered prices caused by the pass-through is a consequence that some 
prices are indexed to the General Price Index (IGP). This price index is more sensitive 
to the variation of exchange rate than to  IPCA.  Moreover, the results observed for full 
inflation are also valid when monetary and fiscal credibility are considered in the model. 
In  brief,  although  monetary  credibility  is  not  significant  for  reducing  the  pass-through 
effect, fiscal credibility can be an important tool for controlling the pressure on inflation 
of administered prices. 
 
The results regarding the estimations for inflation expectations indicate that both 
past  inflation  and  output  gap  are  significant  in  the  explanation  of  the  inflation 
expectations  (see  table  4).  Furthermore,  the  exchange  rate  pass-through  cannot  be 
neglected  (all  coefficients  are  positive  and  in  half  the  models  there  is  statistical 
significance). Such as observed for the case of full inflation, the monetary credibility is 
not an efficient mechanism for reducing the pressure of an increase in the exchange rate 
pass-through  on  inflation  expectations  (coefficients  without  statistical  significance  and 
there is indetermination on the sign).  In contrast, the fiscal credibility  (coefficients  are 
negative  and  significant  for  all  models)  is  revealed  to  be  a  powerful  instrument  for 
reducing  the  increase  in  inflation  expectations  due  to  the  exchange  rate  pass-through 
effect.

Conclusion 
 
 
This  study  presented  empirical  evidence  regarding  the  exchange  rate  pass-
through effect on inflation in the Brazilian economy after the adoption of the inflation 
targeting. In general, the results are in line with most part of the literature indicating that 
the pass-through effect is important in the explanation of the inflation rate.11  

The main contribution in this study was the evaluation of the impact of the fiscal 
and  monetary  credibility  in  the  transmission  mechanism  of  the  pass-through  on 
inflation. The findings denote that although monetary credibility is not an efficient tool 
for reducing the effects from pass-through effect, the possibility of benefits from fiscal 
credibility  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Furthermore,  the  results  from  the  cases  of  inflation  of 
market  prices  and  administered  prices  are  different.  While  monetary  credibility  is 
relevant for the case of market prices, fiscal credibility matters for administered prices. 
A possible reason for this result is that the success of the CBB in achieving the inflation 
target  is  important  to  guide  market’s  expectations.  Regarding  administered  prices,  the 
government’s role is important, as a consequence, fiscal solvency is a possible ally for 
attenuating  the  transmission  of  exchange-rate  pass-through.  Finally,  the  results  also 
reveal that fiscal credibility is an important tool for reducing the impact of the exchange 
rate pass-through effect on inflation expectations. 
 
The  empirical  evidence  in  this  study  is  one  more  contribution  that  indicates 
credibility  is  an  important  tool  for  increasing  the  efficiency  of  the  monetary  policy 
under  inflation  targeting.  In  other  words,  due  to  the  fact  that  high  credibility  helps  to 
mitigate  the  exchange  rate  pass-through  effect,  a  consequence  is  a  better  control  on 
inflation  with  lower  social  cost.  As  observed  by  Svensson  (2000)  and  Céspedes  and 
Soto (2005), the trade-off between inflation and output – and potentially exchange rate 
volatility  –  is  larger  under  imperfect  credibility.  Although  the  effect  of  monetary 
credibility reducing the pass-through is relevant only for market prices, it is important to 
highlight that a government committed to a sustainable public debt, and thus one which 
has  fiscal  credibility,  is  significant  to  reduce  the  pass-through  effect  on  inflation 
expectations and thereby on inflation.
