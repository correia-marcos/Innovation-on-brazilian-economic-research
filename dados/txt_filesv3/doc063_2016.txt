Abstract 

 
This  study  relates  to  the  literature  on  the  communication  and  clarity  of  the  policymakers.  The 
novelty  concerns  the  investigation  of  the  effect  of  the  communication  and  clarity  of  the  fiscal 
authority on market expectations on public debt. The article addresses empirical evidence, based 
on the Brazilian experience, regarding the idea that communication is essential for the coordination 
between the policymaker and the market participants in order to lead expectations. The findings 
suggest  that  the  communications  from  the  Brazilian  National  Treasury  concerning  fiscal  policy 
represent an important tool to improve the effects of the management of the public debt on market 
expectations regarding public debt.

1. Introduction 
 

 

According  to  International  Federal  of  Accounts,  fiscal  transparency  is  one  of  the  main 

pillars of governance in the public sector (IFAC, 2011). In general, fiscal transparency increases 

the society’s confidence in the fiscal management and, as a result, implies better fiscal decisions. 

As pointed out by IMF (http://www.fsb.org/2014/10/cos_070620/), fiscal transparency is critical 

for effective management and accountability. In this framework, information is essential because 

a  bad  quality  of  information  leads  to  wrong  interpretation  by  users  thus  causing  innapropriate 

decisions. In brief, governamental transparency is an essential element in the implementation of 

fiscal policy (Bolívar, Galera, Muñoz, 2015). 

 

The analysis regarding the relevance of communication as a tool for managing expectations 

is well known in the study of monetary policy.1 As suggested by Guthrie and Wright (2000) several 

central banks make use of statements as policy instrument (open mouth operation). However, as 

pointed out by Jansen (2011), regular central bank communication in a nonaccessible manner is 

not sufficient to assure transparency. Hence, only a correct combination between transparency and 

communication  would  reduce  the  uncertainty  on  central  bank’s  preferences,  thereby  improving 

private  sector  expectations.  In  short,  clarity  on  communication  is  essential  for  the  coordination 

between the policymaker and market participants as a way of diminishing asymmetric information. 

Such as observed by Bolívar, Galera, Muñoz (2015), government financial sustainability 

can be affected by the level of understandability of information transparency. Therefore, based on 

the argument that sound private expectations on public debt sustainability is a precondition for the 

success of fiscal policies and that the readability of communications is potentially an important tool 

to  drive  expectations,  we  analyze  the  impact  of  communications  and  its  quality  on  market 

expectations.  

 

Statements  may  be  considered  as  a  coordination  tool.2 However,  the  success  of  a  fiscal 

authority’s  communication  for  driving  private  expectations  depends  on  the  credibility  of  the 

statements (Eusepi and Preston, 2011). As pointed out by de Mendonça and Machado (2013), fiscal 

credibility is essential to stabilize expectations in order to mitigate the risk of insolvency. Fearful 

markets constrain the actions of fiscal authorities, thus it is crucial to manage expectations in order

to convince markets that fiscal policies are sustainable (Karantounias, 2013). 

 

Due  to  the  fact  that  clarity  is  necessary  to  lessen  difficulty  of  the  private  sector  in 

interpreting  the  fiscal  authority’s  message,  such  as  in  Jansen  (2011),  this  paper  focuses  on 

readability. To illustrate how this works in practice, we provide an empirical analysis based on the 

Brazilian  experience.  The  largest  Latin  American  economy,  in  order  to  control  the  dynamic  of 

public  debt,  adopted  a  strategy  for  lengthening  and  improving  the  composition  of  the  domestic 

federal  public  debt  since  November  1999.  Furthermore,  as  an  important  tool  of  communication 

between the policymaker and the private sector, the Brazilian National Treasury issues several daily 

releases (official notes of the Ministry of Finance) regarding fiscal policy. Hence, Brazil is a good 

laboratory to observe if the fiscal authority’s communication improves the private expectations on 

public debt. 

 

The  remainder  of  this  study  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  presents  the  indices  of 

communication  and  clarity  regarding  the  Brazilian  fiscal  authority.  Section  3  presents  the 

methodology  and  data  used  in  the  study.  Section  4  provides  empirical  evidence,  through  an 

econometric analysis, of the effect of communication and clarity on the public debt expectations 

and their volatility. Section 5 concludes the paper. 

 
2. Fiscal indices of communication and clarity  
 

The analysis on how communication of the fiscal authority affects private expectations is 

directly connected with the success of the announced strategy in the conduct of fiscal policy. In the 

case where the information available for the private sector is sufficient to make correct forecasts, 

there  is  no  surprise  on  the  dynamic  of  public  debt.  As  pointed  out  by  Missale,  Giavazzi,  and 

Benigno (2002), the reduction of asymmetric information diminishes the risk of  refinancing the 

debt and thus it increases the expectation of the success of the fiscal policy. Therefore, the search 

for a sound fiscal policy which avoids the default risk depends on the combination of the correct 

strategy for managing public debt with the communication of next actions of the policymaker.  

In  order  to  measure  the  communication  of  fiscal  authority  we  built  an  index  taking  into 

account  the number of  releases  through official  notes available from  the website of Ministry of 

Finance  (www.fazenda.gov.br).  The  index  proposed  in  this  paper  uses  a  discrete  and  positive 

numerical scale in order that each release takes value equal +1. In a way of eliminating unnecessary 

information, we consider only releases concerning actions of fiscal policy. Therefore, regarding 

 

3 

 

 

content, for example, calls for contests are discarded. We aggregate the result per day and based 

on this we create a series that identifies the number of communications with monthly frequency. 

Figure 1a shows the behavior of the communication index (COM) over time. As we can see, the 

number  of  communications  increased  considerably  between  2002  and  2011.  It  is  noteworthy  to 

observe that the top of the trend is the period 2009 to 2012 and it is a clear reflex of the subprime 

crisis.

necessary to consider indicators that can capture the quality of information. Since clarity is essential 

for transparency and the communications are made in written releases, readability is a key piece in 

this  framework.  We  cannot  assure,  in  the  case  of  a  text  that  is  difficult  to  read,  the  content  is 

understood. Hence, the idea of “open mouth operation” could be ineffective. In order to consider 

readability measures in the analysis, such as indicated by Jansen (2011), two well-known indices 

are used. The first is the Flesch reading ease score. According to Flesch (1948) a higher number of 

syllables per word, or a higher number of words per sentence, decreases the readability of a text. 

Based on this idea the Flesch reading ease score (F) is a result of: 

(1) 

F = 206.835 − 1.015 × (words/sentences) − 84.6 × (syllables/words), 

Where: F > 70 denotes a very easy text to read and F < 30 indicates a very difficult text to read.  

In order to use the above-mentioned index, we take into consideration all releases of the 

Treasury regarding fiscal policy in each month. If the month under evaluation does not present a 

communication  on  fiscal  policy  we  use  the  average  of  the  results  observed  in  the  previous  12 

months. Figure 1b presents the performance of Flesch reading ease score over time. There is no 

doubt that the releases from the Brazilian Treasury are not easy to read. Practically all time of the 

time the score is lower than 30, but there is a trend of this difficulty in reading is decreasing over 

time. 

 

As pointed out by Jansen (2011) one drawback with the previous index is the scale because 

the interpretation is not clear for the interval between 30 and 70 (30 < F < 70). In order of surpassing 

this  problem,  Kincaid  et  al.  (1975)  included  the  number  of  years  of  education  needed  to 

comprehend  a  text.  Therefore,  although  the  Flesch-Kincaid  grade  level  also  considers  the  same 

core measures that are used in Flesch reading easy score (word length and sentence length), it has 

different weighting factors. As a consequence, the interpretation of this index is different from the 

previous because a greater score denotes a decrease in clarity (greater number of years of education 

needed  to  comprehend  the  text),  and  thus  the  results  of  the  two  tests  correlate  approximately 

inversely. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level is calculated as follows: 

(2)  

FK = 0.39 × (words/sentences) + 11.8 × (syllables/words) − 15.59. 

 

Figure 1c shows the Flesch-Kincaid grade level along time. In general, it is possible to see 

that  there  is  an  improvement  over  time.  In  other  words,  the  trend  reveals  the  clarity  on  fiscal 

communication is increasing.

3. Methodology and data  

 

Limited to the availability of the information from the National Treasury, the period under 

analysis is from November of 2002 to September of 2014. Therefore, it is a period under inflation 

targeting (adopted in June of 1999) and after the implementation of a strategy for managing public 

debt  with  the  objective  of  extending  the  average  maturity  and  improving  the  public  debt 

composition.  

In a general way, the literature on public debt management presents, as a rule of thumb for 

improving the performance of fiscal  policy, the  increase in  the  average  maturity and the  partial 

indexation of the public debt.3 Following these recommendations, the Brazilian National Treasury 

has adopted two main guidelines after 2001 (de Mendonça and Machado, 2013): (i) replaces bonds 

indexed to the interest rate and indexed to the BRL/dollar exchange rate with fixed rate bonds and 

inflation-linked bonds; and (ii) increases the average maturity of the public debt in order to reduce 

the refinancing risk. Therefore, the two main channels regarding the management of the public debt 

are: the channel of the indexation profile and the channel of the average maturity. 

There is no doubt that most of the time there is a trend of increase in the average maturity 

of  the  public  debt  (figure  2)  which,  in  turn,  denotes  a  concern  of  the  fiscal  authority  with  this 

strategy of improving public debt management. In relation to the indexation of the public debt, we 

create  an  index  to  simplify  the  interpretation.  Since,  in  general,  increases  in  fixed  rate  bonds 

(FIX_B)  and  inflation-linked  bonds  (INF_B)  represent  improvements  in  public  debt  profile, 

whereas  increases  in  bonds  indexed  to  the  interest  rate  (INT_B)  and  indexed  to  the  BRL/dollar 

exchange rate (EX_B) indicate a deterioration of the public debt profile, the index is a result of the 

difference between these parts. Therefore, the index is calculated as: 

(3) 

INDEX = (FIX_B + INF_B) – (INT_B + EX_B). 

The interpretation of the INDEX is straightforward. When the INDEX is positive, it denotes 

a  good  quality  of  the  indexation  profile.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  INDEX  is  negative,  it 

represents deterioration in the public debt profile. Figure 2 shows that in the second semester of 

2006 the INDEX became positive and there is a trend toward improvement.

Taking into account the relevance of the indexation profile and the average maturity of the 

 

 

 

 

public  debt  and  with  the  purpose  of  providing  empirical  evidence  regarding  the  effect  that 

communication and its clarity have on market expectations regarding public debt, we consider the 

following baseline models:4 

(4) 

(5) 

Et(DEBTt+12) = 0 + 1DEBTt-1 + 2INDEXt-1  + 3(INDEX x Z)t-1 + εt, and  

Et(DEBTt+12) = β0 + β1DEBTt-1 + β2AMDt-1  + β3(AMD x Z)t-1 + ζt, 

where: t, ζt ~ N(0,2);Et(DEBTt+12) - market expectations regarding public debt to GDP ratio for 

the next 12 months;5 DEBT - is the public debt to GDP ratio; INDEX  - measures the quality of the 

public debt indexation (indexation profile) – trend (Hodrick-Prescott filter); AMD – is the average 

maturity  of  the  public  debt  (in  months);  Z  –  is  a  vector  of  explanatory  variables  regarding 

communication of fiscal policy and its clarity (COM , F, and FK); INDEX x Z – is an interaction 

term  between  the  indexation  profile  and  the  change  of  the  communication/clarity  of  the  fiscal 

policy; and AMD x Z – is an interaction term that is the average maturity of the public debt and the 

change of the communication/clarity of the fiscal policy. 

The interaction terms  in  the equations above  allow us to  observe whether an increase in 

communication or in clarity would be able to amplify the effect of the effort of the fiscal authority 

to  improve  the  indexation  profile  and  to  extend  the  average  maturity  on  market  expectations 

regarding  public  debt/GDP  ratio.  For  example,  considering  equation  4  (the  channel  of  the

indexation profile), the effect of an improvement due to COM and F is given by α2+α3 < α2, while 

FK  implies  α2+α3  >  α2.  The  channel  of  the  average  maturity  retains  the  same  idea  for  the 

coefficients β2 and β3. 

 

As pointed out by Blinder et al. (2008) skillful communications can raise the signal-to-noise 

ratio  and  reduce  financial  market  volatility.  The  basic  idea  is  that  when  central  bankers 

communicate clearly, financial markets have less difficulty in interpreting the information and thus 

there is less uncertainty (Jansen, 2011). Based on this idea we can analyze if the communication of 

the  fiscal  authority  is  sufficiently  clear  to  affect  the  volatility  in  expectations  of  public  debt.  In 

short, the idea is straightforward, clarity from the fiscal authority can lead to less uncertainty, which 

implies lower volatility. Therefore, with the intention to analyze the effect from the communication 

and the clarity on the volatility of the public debt expectations we rewrite equations (4) and (5) as: 

(6)  t[Et(DEBTt+12)] = 4 + 5DEBTt-1 + 6INDEXt-1  + 7(INDEX x Z)t-1 + t, and  

(7)  t[Et(DEBTt+12)] = β4 + β5DEBTt-1 + β6AMDt-1  + β7(AMD x Z)t-1 + ϛt, 

where: t,  ϛt  ~  N(0,2); t[Et(DEBTt+12)] is  the  standard  deviation  of  rolling  window  of  twelve 

months (j=12) as follows: 

, X= Et(DEBTt+12). 

In order to estimate the equations 4 to 7 we use two methods: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) 

and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The choice of these methods is because they allow 

one to see in a simple manner the statistical significance and the sign of each coefficient on each 

variable in the model. Therefore they represent a straightforward framework to observe the impact 

caused by communication and clarity. 

Although OLS models are useful for our objective, in general, the main reason for the use 

of  GMM  in  this  study  is  due  to  the  combination of  the  problem  of  heteroskedasticity,  which  is 

common  in  macroeconomic  time  series,  with  the  possible  risk  of  endogeneity  captured  by  the 

expectations. As pointed out by Wooldridge (2001), in order to consider a more efficient GMM 

estimator  than  OLS,  overriding  restrictions  need  to  be  considered.  Therefore,  the  J-statistic  is 

presented for each model as a test of over-identifying moment conditions. Furthermore, besides the 

one-step estimations, we make estimations for two-step GMM estimators using Windmeijer (2005) 

correction to address small-sample downward biases on standard errors.6 

                                                           
6 The  period  under  consideration  is  from  November  of  2002  to  September  of  2014  (143  observations  (monthly 
frequency). Tests regarding unit root are available upon request to the authors.

4. Empirical evidence 

 

 
 

In  general,  from  the  channel  of  indexation  profile,  there  are  strong  indications  that 

communication and clarity of the fiscal authority are relevant to reduce expectation on the public 

debt level (see table 1). In relation to the effect of the communication (INDEX x COM) on the 

expectation  of  public  debt,  the  findings  (coefficients  are  negative  and  significant)  confirm  the 

assumption that an increase in the communication amplifies the effect of an improvement in the 

public debt profile. Concerning the effect of clarity on expectations of public debt the result also 

confirms the benefits. The coefficients on both indices (INDEX X F and INDEX X FK) have 

statistical significance and present signs in agreement with the theoretical perspective.

The  estimations  from  the  channel  of  the  average  maturity  (table  2)  indicate  that  only 

communication seems to be relevant for decreasing public debt expectations. In contrast to what is 

observed  for  the  indexation  profile,  although  the  coefficients  regarding  clarity  on  the  average 

maturity also suggest a decrease in public debt expectations, they are not significant. It is important 

to note that although the increase in public debt maturity is part of good practices for public debt 

management, this cannot be true in the case of developing economies like Brazil. Such as pointed 

out  by de Mendonça and  Machado  (2012), it is  possible that for implementing this strategy the 

government needs to pay high interest rates which in turn implies an increase in the service of the 

public debt. In brief, the non-significant effect of clarity can be a result of this channel not being 

sufficiently relevant for public debt expectations (coefficients on AMD in the models 2 and 3 are 

not significant).

Regarding the results concerning volatility of the public debt expectations (see tables 3 and 

4), it is observed that only in the case of the channel of the indexation profile is the effect caused 

from  the  communication  of  the  fiscal  authority  relevant.  In  fact,  the  significant  and  positive 

coefficients on communication indicate that the expectations react to the releases from the National 

Treasury regarding fiscal policy. However, no model through the channels of indexation profile 

and average maturity of the public debt presented statistical significance in relation to the effect of 

the  clarity  on  the  volatility  of  the  expectations.  This  result  suggests  that  although  the 

communications from  the fiscal  authority can  affect  the volatility of the expectations, clarity  of 

these communications are not sufficient strongly to reduce the volatility.

4.1. Different horizons for the expectations of the public debt 

 

 

Since communication and clarity, especially through the channel of indexation profile, are 

relevant  to  decrease  public  debt  expectations  for  the  next  12  months,  we  extend  our  analysis 

providing new empirical evidence based on an increased horizon (24 months and 36 months ahead). 

In general, the expectations on the public debt present a downward trend along the period and the 

longer expectations are lower than shorter expectations (see figure 5).

Expectations of the public debt (% GDP - 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months ahead) 

Figure 3 

 

The main idea is  to  observe the power of communication and  clarity in  affecting longer 

 

 

 
 

horizons.  With  this  intention,  we  perform  this  analysis  taking  into  account  the  models  that 

presented statistical significance for the effect of the communication/clarity on expectations in the 

previous section (see tables 1 to 4). Hence, the models selected are: (i) channel of the indexation 

profile: (public debt expectations – table 1) – models 1, 2, and 3; (volatility of the expectations – 

table 3) – model 1); and (ii) channel of the average maturity: (public debt expectations – table 2): 

model 1. The results are presented in table 5. 

 

Such as observed in the previous section, the results suggest that communication and the 

clarity of the fiscal authority amplify the power of an improvement of the indexation profile on 

public debt expectations (see table 5). In other words, communication and clarity represent a tool, 

through the channel of the indexation profile, which is able to affect public debt expectations for 

different horizons.  

 

Regarding the effect of the communication on the volatility of the public debt expectations 

with  longer  horizons,  the  results  show  that,  independent  of  the  horizon  in  consideration,  the 

communication provokes a reaction in the volatility of the expectations for both channels of the 

indexation profile and of the average maturity (see tables 6 and 7). Therefore, it is an additional 

evidence that the market takes into account the information released by the government and that 

this information is used for building forecasts with different horizons.

4.2. Robustness analysis 

 

In order to check the previous results regarding the effects caused by communication and 

clarity from the fiscal authority on public debt expectations, a VAR was used. In this framework 

the variables are considered endogenous: E(DEBT), COM, F, and FK. As usual, the analysis of a 

VAR  is  based  on  impulse  response  functions  because  they  allow  one  to  see  the  impulse  on 

expectations of the public debt caused by shocks (or innovations) provoked by residual variables 

over time (Sims, 1980). As a manner of eliminating the problem of the ordering of variables in the 

VAR, the generalized impulse response function was selected in the decomposition method.7 

Figure 4 shows the results of the generalized impulse-response functions and are plotted for 

12 months after the shock. The results denote that communication from fiscal authority may imply 

a decrease in expectations of public debt which persists over time. It is important to remember that 

an increase in F means an increase in the clarity while an increase in FK means a decrease in the 

clarity.  Therefore,  the  results  observed  from  both  indices  in  the  impulse-response  graphs  are  in 

agreement with the idea that an increase in the clarity of the fiscal authority (that is, an increase in 

F or a decrease in FK) helps to reduce the expectations of an increase in the public debt. 

In other words, independent of the horizon used for the expectations of public debt in the 

analysis (h=12 months, h=24 months, and h=36 months) the results indicate that an unexpected 

positive shock transmitted from communication and clarity implies a decrease in expectations of 

public debt which remains over time. In brief, the results from VAR confirm the previous empirical 

evidence that communication and clarity are important tools to guide expectations of public debt. 

                                                           
7 Based on Schwarz and Hannan-Quinn criteria, the VAR order is 4. In addition, all roots have modulus less than one 
and lie inside the unit circle. All tests are available upon request to the authors.

5. Conclusion 

 

Nowadays,  several  international  agencies  (e.g.  IMF,  World  Bank,  IFAC)  consider 
 
transparency  and,  in  particular,  information  that  is  more  understandable,  as  essential  for  the 
implementation with success of the fiscal policy. This paper amplifies the analysis on traditional 
tools  used  by  government  regarding  fiscal  transparency  making  use  of  a  direct  channel  of 
government with citizens, that is, the information that is released by internet through official 
notes. In particular, we evaluate if this information is, in fact, understood by the market. The 
main  result  is  that  communication  and  clarity  of  the  fiscal  authority  are  relevant  to  lead 
expectations on public debt to a lower level.  

Based  on  the  communications  through  official  notes  from  the  Brazilian  Ministry  of 
Finance regarding fiscal policy, we investigate their effects on the public debt expectations and 
their  volatility.  With  this  purpose  we  considered  the  number  of  releases  as  a  proxy  of  the 
communication  and  the  quality  of  these  releases  from  two  readability  measures  (Flesch  and 
Flesch-Kincaid) as proxies for the clarity of the fiscal authority. Taking into account the two 
main  channels  of  the  public  debt  management  (indexation  profile  and  average  maturity)  we 
analyzed the effect of communication and clarity on expectations (and volatility). 
 
The results of the estimations indicate that although there exists statistical significance 
of  the  coefficients  on  communication  in  the  case  of  the  average  maturity  channel,  the  main 
channel  in  which  communication  and  clarity  can  affect  the  public  debt  expectations  is  the 
indexation profile. Focusing on this channel we observe that both communication (number of 
releases) and clarity (quality of the information) are relevant to decrease the expectations of an 
increase  in  the  public  debt.  Regarding  the  volatility  of  the  expectations,  although  the 
coefficients  on  communication  present  statistical  significance  and  thus  indicate  that  the 
expectations react to the releases of the fiscal authority, we did not find evidence that the clarity 
is relevant to decrease the volatility of the public debt expectations. 
 
In short, the results in this paper indicate that the communications from the Brazilian 
National Treasury concerning fiscal policy represent an important tool to improve the effects 
of the management of the public debt on market expectations regarding public debt. Therefore 
the search for an improvement in  the communication of the fiscal  authority  (e.g., increasing 
clarity)  to  lead  public  debt  expectations  cannot  be  neglected.  Moral  of  the  story:  when  the 
government opens its mouth is necessary that it be careful with its words.
