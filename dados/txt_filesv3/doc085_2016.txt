Abstract:  This  paper  explores  implications  for  economic  growth  driven  by  effective  demand  of 
income  distribution  featuring  the  possibility  of  profit  sharing  with  workers.  Firms  choose  to 
compensate  workers  with  a base  wage or a share of profits on top  of  this base  wage.  In  accordance 
with  robust  empirical  evidence,  workers  in  sharing  firms  have  higher  productivity  than  workers  in 
non-sharing firms. The distribution of employee compensation strategies and labor productivity across 
firms  is  evolutionarily  time-varying.  Two  major  results  carrying  relevant  theoretical  and  policy 
implications are obtained. First, heterogeneity in employee compensation strategies across firms may 
emerge  as  a  long-run  equilibrium  outcome.  Second,  in  the  long  run,  a  higher  frequency  of  profit-
sharing firms does not necessarily generate higher economic growth. 

Keywords: economic growth, income distribution, profit sharing, evolutionary dynamics. 

 
Resumo: Este artigo aborda implicações para o crescimento econômico guiado pela demanda efetiva 
de a distribuição de renda ter a possibilidade de compartilhamento de lucros com os trabalhadores. As 
firmas escolhem remunerar os trabalhadores com um salário base ou com uma participação nos lucros 
além  desse  salário  base.  Conforme  evidência  empírica  robusta,  a  produtividade  do  trabalho  é  maior 
nas firmas que adotam compartilhamento de lucros que naquelas que não o adotam. A distribuição das 
estratégias  de  remuneração  e  da  produtividade  média  do  trabalho  na  população  de  firmas  varia  ao 
longo do tempo de maneira  evolucionária. O artigo deriva dois  principais resultados  com  relevantes 
implicações teóricas e de política pública. Primeiro, a heterogeneidade nas estratégias de remuneração 
entre as firmas pode ser um equilíbrio de longo prazo estável. Segundo, no equilíbrio de longo prazo, 
uma maior frequência de firmas que adotam compartilhamento de lucros não necessariamente resulta 
em maior crescimento econômico.

1. Introduction 

Employee  profit  sharing  has  experienced  an  increasing  (even  if  fluctuating)  popularity  in  some 
advanced economies in the last few decades (D’Art and Turner, 2004, Kruse et al., 2010). From a longer-term 
perspective, there have been rising and falling waves of interest in profit sharing since their origin in the 19th 
century (Mitchell et al., 1990, Blasi, et al., 2013). 

The  main  drive  behind  a  firm’s  offering  of  profit  sharing  to  workers  is  that  connecting  workers’ 
earnings to the profits of the firm is believed in theory to induce workers to increase commitment, effort and 
other attitudes leading to their higher productivity. In fact, attitude surveys find that employers and employees 
usually  believe  that  profit  sharing  helps  improve  firm  performance  in  several  dimensions  (Weitzman  and 
Kruse, 1990, and Blasi et al., 2010). 

Other  compensation  schemes through  which  workers’  earnings  depend  on  the  firm’s  performance  (or 
work  group)  are  gain  sharing,  employee  ownership  and  stock  options.  Profit-sharing  plans  themselves  vary 
greatly, and some major ways in which they differ concern what is shared (e.g., total profits or profits above 
some target or threshold level), how and when sharing is made (e.g., in cash or company stocks, in a deferred or 
non-deferred way) and with whom sharing is made (e.g., directly to workers or to some workers’ retirement or 
pension plan). However, there is survey evidence that non-deferred and in cash profit sharing is ranked first by 
employees as a motivation device (Blasi et al., 2010). 

There  is  considerable  empirical  evidence  that  profit  sharing  raises  labor  productivity.  Although  the 
estimated magnitude of the productivity gain varies from study to study, it is  often non-negligible. Weitzman 
and Kruse  (1990)  apply  meta-analysis  to  sixteen  studies  to  find  that  the  productivity  gain  of  profit  sharing  is 
positive at infinitesimal significance levels. Doucouliagos (1995) applies meta-analysis to forty-three studies to 
find that profit sharing is positively associated with productivity. Conyon and Freeman (2004), using UK data, 
find  that  profit-sharing  firms  tend  to  outperform  other  firms  in  both  productivity  and  financial  performance. 
D’Art and Turner (2004) use data for 11 European countries to find that profit sharing is positively associated 
with  productivity  and  profitability,  while  Kim  (1998),  using  U.S.  data,  finds  that  albeit  profit  sharing  raises 
labor productivity, profits do not rise, as gains from profit sharing are cancelled out by increased labor costs. In 
a  quasi-experimental  study,  Peterson  and  Luthans  (2006)  randomly  assigned  profit-sharing  plans  at  3  of  21 
establishments  within  a  U.S.  firm,  finding  that  productivity  and  profits  rose  in  the  sharing  establishments 
relative to the control group. 

Given  this  empirical  evidence,  we  set  forth  a  dynamic  model  of  capacity  utilization  and  economic 
growth, in which income distribution features profit sharing. Unlike in a related approach in Lima (2010), firms 
behave heterogeneously as regards employee compensation strategy. Firms choose to compensate workers with 
either only a base wage or a share of profits on top of this base wage. In line with the empirical evidence just 
reported, workers hired by profit-sharing firms have a higher productivity than their counterparts in base-wage 
firms.  Meanwhile,  unlike  in  Lima  (2012),  the  heterogeneity  in  compensation  strategies  and  the  productivity 
gain that accrues to profit-sharing firms are not parametric  constants, but co-evolve endogenously through an 
evolutionary  process.  Hence,  our  model is  well  fitted to  explore possible explanations for  the  evidence  using 
U.K.  data  that  firms  switch  modes  of  employee  compensation  frequently,  with  the  gross  changes  in  modes 
being far more common than the net changes, which suggests that firms have trouble optimizing and that the 
transaction costs of switching are relatively low (Bryson and Freeman, 2010). Also, we explore the implications 
of  the  evolutionary  dynamics  of  the  distribution  of  compensation  strategies  and  the  productivity  gain  that 
accrues  to  sharing  firms  for  effective  demand,  and  thereby  for  capacity  utilization  and  growth.  Given  the 
paramount role of effective demand and income distribution in  demand-led economics, it is fitting to explore 
macroeconomic implications of profit sharing in a model that conforms to essential tenets of this tradition.1 

                                                           
1 Weitzman (1985) claims that profit sharing can deliver full employment with low inflation. If part of workers’ 
total  compensation  is  shared  profits,  so  that  the  base  wage  is  lower,  the  marginal  cost  of  labor  is  lower  and 
firms  will  be  willing  to  hire  more  workers.  As  the  marked  up  price  is  lower,  a  real  balance  effect  raises 
aggregate demand and hence desired output. Clearly, Weitzman (1985) ignores effective demand problems and 
implicitly  sees  involuntary  unemployment  as  due  to  downward  wage  inflexibility  (Davidson,  1986-87, 
Rothschild,  1986-87).  In  our  model,  the  proportion  of  sharing  firms  and  the  average  productivity  are 
endogenously  time-varying,  and  we  explore  implications  of  profit  sharing  for  macroeconomic  performance 
driven by effective demand.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the structure of the model and 
investigates  its behavior in the ultra-short run. Section 3  explores  the behavior of the model in the short run, 
while  Section  4  investigates  the  coupled  evolutionary  dynamics  of  the  distribution  of  compensation  modes 
across  firms  and  the  productivity  gain  that  accrues  to  profit-sharing  firms.  This  section  also  explores 
implications of such coupled evolutionary dynamics for income distribution and hence for aggregate effective 
demand, capacity utilization and economic growth. The final section summarizes the main conclusions reached 
along the way. 

2. Structure of the model and its behavior in the ultra-short run 

The economy is closed and without government activities, producing a single (homogeneous) good for 
both investment and consumption. Production is carried out by a  large (and fixed) population of  imperfectly-
competitive  firms,  which  combine  two  (physically  homogeneous)  factors  of  production,  capital  and  labor, 
through a fixed-coefficient technology. Firms produce (and hire labor) according to effective demand, which is 
assumed to be insufficient for any of them to produce at full capacity at prevailing prices. 

An individual firm chooses between two employee compensation strategies: it either pays workers only 
 
  of  sharing  (or  type  s)  firms, 

a  real  base  wage 
(profit-sharing  strategy).  In  a  given  period  there  is  a  proportion 

  (non-sharing  strategy)  or  pays  them  this  real  base  wage  and  a  share  of  real  profits 

, is composed by non-sharing (or type n) firms.  In accordance with the 
while the remaining proportion, 
empirical literature reported earlier, a profit-sharing firm is willing to play such compensation strategy because 
the  resulting labor productivity is strictly higher than otherwise. Productivity is homogeneous across workers 
hired  by  firms  playing  a  given  strategy.  Since  the  real  base  wage  is  assumed  to  be  the  same  under  both 
compensation strategies, a worker hired by a sharing firm will receive a higher total real compensation than a 
worker hired by a non-sharing firm along the economically meaningful domain given by strictly positive profits 
for sharing firms.2 

,  and  the  profit-sharing  coefficient, 

To keep focus on the dynamics of the distribution of compensation strategies and its implications for 
income distribution, capacity utilization and economic growth, we simplify  matters by assuming that the real 
base  wage, 
,  remain  constant  over  time.  The  distribution  of 
compensation strategies across firms, 
, which is given in both the ultra-short run and the short run as 
a result from previous dynamics, changes beyond the short run according to an evolutionary dynamics (the so-
called  replicator  dynamics).  In  the  ultra-short  run,  for  given  values  of  the  real  base  wage,  profit-sharing 
coefficient, productivity differential and frequency distribution of compensation strategies, individual markups 
vary  so  as  to  ensure  that  individual  prices  are  equalized.  Over  time,  the  co-evolution  of  the  distribution  of 
compensation  strategies  and  the  productivity  differential,  by  leading  to  changes  in  the  average  markup  and 
hence in the wage share in income, causes changes in aggregate effective demand and therefore in the short-run 
equilibrium values of capacity utilization and economic growth. 

Formally, we define the productivity differential as: 

(1) 

 

, 

where 

  denotes  labor  productivity  in  firms  of  type 

, 

  is  total  output  of  firms  of  type 

,  and 

  is  total  employment  of  firms  type 

.  As  regards  pricing  behavior,  we  assume  that 

established  firms  face  a  binding  limit-price  constraint, 
,  arising  from  the  purpose  of  forestalling  entry  by 
potential  competitors.3  This  exogenously  given  constant  price,  which  is  herein  normalized  to  one,  is  set  as  a 
markup over nominal unit labor costs. Hence, the following condition holds in the ultra-short run: 

                                                           
2 Empirical evidence shows that profit sharing has a meaningful effect on worker total compensation (Kruse et 
al., 2010). In fact, Capelli and Neumark (2004) find that total labor costs exclusive of the sharing component do 
not fall significantly in pre/post comparisons of firms that adopt profit sharing. This suggests that profit sharing 
tends to come on top of, rather than in place of, a base wage. 

3 The prolific approach to entry and limiting pricing was pioneered by Bain (1949) and Harrod (1952).

. 

Having  chosen  to  follow  a  profit-sharing  strategy,  a  firm  has  to  further  decide  how  it  will  use  the 
corresponding  productivity  differential.  The  specification  in  (2)  assumes  that  a  sharing  firm  uses  its 
productivity differential to apply a higher markup than non-sharing firms, while charging the same price.4 We 
could  assume  that  not  all  sharing  firms  make  the  same  decision  with  respect  to  how  to  use  their  (common) 
productivity  differential  given  by 
,  but  we  simplify  matters  by  assuming  that  all  sharing  firms  behave 
alike in that respect. Moreover, given that such productivity differential varies over time with the distribution of 
compensation  strategies  across  firms,  as  described  in  the  next  section,  the  average  markup  given  by 
  also  varies  over  time.  Therefore,  the  ultra-short-run  equilibrium  values  of  the  individual 

markups can be obtained by combining (1) and (2):

from which it follows that 

 for any 

. A profit-sharing firm can be intuitively described 

as a firm willing to bet on the possibility of obtaining a productivity differential, 

, which is high enough to 

allow  it to  set  a  markup, 

, which is  sufficiently  higher  than  the (exogenously  given)  markup  set  by  a  non-

sharing  firm, 

,  while  charging  the  same  price  (and  therefore  without  harming  its  ability  to  sell  as  much 

output as a non-sharing firm). Moreover, a sharing firm expects this markup differential to be high enough to 
allow it to make at least as much (and preferably more) profits (net of shared profits) than a non-sharing firm. 
As explored in Section 4, though, the resulting productivity differential may fall short of the level required for 
the profit-sharing bet to prove successful. 

 

Using (1), the total real profits of sharing and non-sharing firms are, respectively: 

(5) 

(6) 

 

 

; and: 

. 

Using (5) and (6), the shares of real profit in real output of sharing and non-sharing firms in the ultra-short-run 
equilibrium are given, respectively, by: 

(7) 

 

; and 

                                                           
4  Another  alternative  would  be  for  sharing  firms  to  use  their productivity  differential to  charge  a lower  price 
than non-sharing firms while applying the same markup. Yet another possibility would be for sharing firms to 
use  their  productivity  differential  to  both  raise  their  markup  and  improve  their  price  competitiveness.  We 
abstract  from  these  other  possibilities  by  assuming  that  firms  face  a  kinked  demand  curve  (Hall  and  Hitch 
(1939), Sweezy (1939)), the market price for which is stable. This price is sustained over time by each firm’s 
fear  that,  if it undercuts, the  other  firms  will  do  the  same.  A  firm  has  no  incentive  to  charge  more  than  such 
price as it fears that the other firms will not do the same.

. 

The  profit  share  expression  in  (7)  denotes  the  proportion  of  gross  profits  in  the  real  output  of  sharing  firms, 
since an exogenously given fraction of such profits, given by 
, is shared with workers. Using (7), 
the net unit return of sharing firms in the ultra-short-run equilibrium is given by: 

(9) 

 

, 

Using (8) and (9), the ultra-short-run equilibrium value of the average net profit share can be expressed as: 

(10) 

 

. 

As  explained  in  the  next  section,  firms  accumulate  capital  at  the  same  rate,  which  implies  that  the 

aggregate capital stock, 

, remains uniformly distributed across firms. It then follows that:5 

(11) 

 

 

where 

 is the total capital stock of firms of type 

. Given (10), it follows that the proportion of the 

aggregate capital stock that is uniformly available to the firms of each type is proportional to the share of each 

type in the population of firms, that is, 

 and 

. 

Meanwhile,  given  that  prices  are  equalized  across  firms,  aggregate  effective  demand  is  uniformly 
distributed not only across firms, but across compensation strategies as well. Thus, capacity utilization is also 
equalized across compensation strategies: 

(12) 

 

, 

where 

  is  a  proxy  for  the  degree  of  capacity  utilization  of  type 

  firms,  while 

  denotes 

average capacity utilization and 

 average output.6 

Using  (5),  (6),  (7),  (8),  (11)  and  (12),  the  (gross)  profit  rates  of  sharing  and  non-sharing  firms  in  the 

ultra-short-run equilibrium can then be expressed as follows: 

(13) 

(14) 

 

 

; and: 

. 

Using (9) and (13), the net profit rate of sharing firms in the ultra-short-run equilibrium is then given by: 

                                                           
5 The meaning of the implied assumption (11) can be explained as follows. Let

 be the total measure of firms 

across firms, it follows that 

. By definition, 

, so we obtain (11) by multiplying both 

sides of these equalities by 

. 

6  Therefore,  we  are  assuming  that  firms  are  also  homogeneous  as  regards  the ratio  of  capital  to  full-capacity 
output, which is an exogenously given constant.

Therefore,  using  (14)  and  (15),  the  ultra-short-run  equilibrium  value  of  the  average  net  profit  rate  can  be 
expressed as: 

(16) 

 

. 

3. Behavior of the model in the short run 

We  have  assumed  earlier  that  the  population  of  firms, 
, the labor productivity and the markup in non-sharing firms, 

,  the  (limit-)price  level, 

,  the  real  base 
, respectively, and the profit-

 and 

wage, 

sharing  coefficient, 

,  all  remain  constant  over  time.  The  short  run  period 

  is  defined  as  a  time  frame  in 

which  the  aggregate  capital  stock, 

,  the  labor  supply, 

,  the  productivity  differential  of  profit-sharing 

firms, 

 (and hence their corresponding markup differential, 

), the distribution of compensation 

, and therefore income distribution measured by the average profit share, 

strategies across firms, 
, can all 
be taken as predetermined by previous dynamics.7 The existence of excess aggregate (and individual) capacity 
ensures  that  aggregate  (and  individual)  output  will  adjust  to  remove  any  excess  aggregate  (and  individual) 
, are equal to  aggregate desired 
demand or supply, so that in short-run equilibrium, net aggregate  savings, 

investment, 

. 

The economy is inhabited by two classes, capitalists who own the firms and workers. Workers provide 
labor  and  earn  a  base  wage  income,  when  they  work  for  non-sharing  firms.  Workers  in  sharing  firms  also 
receive a share of the latter’s profit income, which is the entire surplus over the respective base wage bill. We 
assume that workers’ total compensation is all spent on consumption, while capitalists homogeneously save a 
fraction, 
, of their  net profit income. Using (11)-(15), net aggregate savings as a proportion of 

the capital stock at period 

 can be expressed as follows: 

(17) 

. 

For  simplicity,  we  assume  that  firms  behave  alike  as  regards  investment.  Reasonably,  firms’  desired 
investment depends on their expected profits (due to profitability-type effects) and demand-driven output (due 
to  accelerator-type  effects).  But  when  an  individual  firm  makes  and  implements  (at  the  same  period,  for 
simplicity) its investment plans, it is uncertain as to what worker compensation strategy it (or, for that matter, 
any other firm) will be playing at each period of the relevant future. In fact, the replicator dynamics that drives 
the  frequency  distribution  of  compensation  strategies  across  firms  (to  be  detailed  in  the  next  section)  takes 
firms as having limited and localized knowledge as to the system as a whole. Consequently, it is reasonable to 
assume  that the  desired  investment  of an individual  firm  varies  positively  with  its expectation  of the  average 
levels of the profit share and capacity utilization. 

Formally, average desired capital accumulation at period 

, which is aggregate desired investment as a 

proportion of the aggregate capital stock, is given by: 

(18) 

 

, 

                                                           
7 Since in the next section we explore the behavior of the economy in the transition from the short to the long 
run,  thereafter  we  attach  a  subscript 
  to  all  the  short-run  variables  (be  they  endogenous  or  predetermined). 
Therefore,  in  the  short  run  we  assume  that  the  equilibrium  values  of  the  ultra-short-run  variables  are  always 
attained.

 and 

 denote, respectively, the expected average levels of the profit share and capacity utilization 

by any individual firm, whereas

 are parametric constants. The time index of 

 and 

 refers to the period at which the expectation about the relevant future is formed. The specification in (18) is 

an  expectations-augmented  version  of  the  desired  capital  accumulation  function  put  forward  in  Marglin  and 
Bhaduri (1990), the latter from which it is known that the resulting output growth can vary either positively or 
negatively with the (average) profit share depending on the relative strength of the several effects at play. We 
could assume that firms (even when playing the same compensation strategy) have heterogeneous expectations 
concerning the average values of the profit share and capacity utilization in the relevant future.  However, we 
postulate  that,  facing  an  uncertain  future,  firms  uniformly  proxy  such  expected  average  levels  by  their 
respective current average levels. In our model, a given share of the aggregate profit income accrues to workers 
as profit sharing, though. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that firms proxy the expected average profit share by 
the current average net profit share, which is given by (10). 

Assuming  in  (18)  that 

  (along  with  using  (10))  and 

,  we  obtain  the  following 

expression for the average desired rate of capital accumulation: 

(19) 

 

. 

Finally, by substituting (17) and (19) in the goods market equilibrium condition given by 

 and 

using (10), we obtain the short-run equilibrium capacity utilization: 

(20) 

 

. 

Note  that  the  short-run  equilibrium  capacity  utilization  depends  on  parametric  constants  along  with  the 
productivity  differential, 
,  which are  predetermined  in 
the short run and co-evolve in the transition from the short to the long run (as described in the next section).8 
We can substitute (20) in (17) to obtain the short-run equilibrium output growth rate: 

, and the  distribution  of  compensation  strategies, 

(21) 

 

. 

Hence,  the  short-run  equilibrium  output  growth  also  depends  on  parametric  constants  along  with  the 
productivity differential, 

, and the distribution of compensation strategies, 

. 

4. Behavior of the model in the long run 

In the long run we assume that the  ultra- and short-run equilibrium values of the income distribution, 
capacity utilization and economic growth are always attained, with the economy moving towards the long run 
due  to  changes  in  the  aggregate  stock  of  capital, 
,  the  productivity 
differential, 
.  In order to sharpen  focus on the  coupled 
dynamics  of  the  distribution  of  compensation  strategies  and  the  productivity  differential,  we  assume  that  the 
supply of available labor grows endogenously at the same rate as the capital stock.9 

, and the distribution of compensation strategies, 

,  the  supply  of  available  labor,

standard Keynesian stability condition in effective demand-driven  models like the one set forth in this paper. 

This means that 

 is positive and stable if average savings are more responsive than average desired 

investment  to  changes  in  average  capacity  utilization,  which  in  turn  requires  that  the  denominator  of  the 
expression in (20-a) is positive. 

9 Consequently, the constancy of the productivity differential and the distribution of compensation strategies in

At a given (short-run) period 

 
 of the population of firms, which may vary from one period to the next one, 

there is a fraction 

adopting the profit-sharing strategy. The remaining fraction, 

, is made up of firms that pay only the base 

wage.  Let 

  be  the  average  real  earnings  of  workers  at  period 

,  where 

 and 

 are the real earnings of a worker hired by a profit-sharing firm and a worker 

hired  by  a  non-sharing  firm  in  period 

,  respectively.  Consequently,  the  differential  between  the  higher  real 

earnings and the average real earnings can be written as 

 for all 

. 

In line with the empirical evidence reported earlier, we assume that the extent to which productivity in profit-
sharing firms is greater than productivity in non-sharing firms varies positively with the relative real earnings 

differential given by 

. Formally, we consider the following productivity differential function: 

(22) 

 

, 

where 

  and 

  for  all  differential 

.  Moreover,  we  assume 

that 

.  Hence,  in  line  with  the  empirical  evidence  that  the  productivity  gains  arising  from 

profit sharing are not unlimited, the productivity differential in (22) not only increases at a decreasing rate, but 
it also tends to become insignificant for very large values of the relative real earnings differential.10 We can use 
(5) to re-write (22) as follows: 

(22-a) 

 

. 

As re-written in (22-a), the productivity differential function has an intuitive interpretation. Given that 
 is 

 is the respective unit cost of labor, it follows that 

 is the output per worker of a sharing firm and 

the profit per worker of a sharing firm and 

 is the amount of profit per worker of a sharing firm which 

is shared with its workers. Hence, given 

 and 

, the next-period productivity differential varies positively 

with  the  profit-sharing  coefficient  and  negatively  with  the  base  wage.  Meanwhile,  given 

, 

  and 

,  the 

next-period  productivity  differential  increases  with 

,  the  proportion  of  firms  playing  the  non-sharing 

strategy in a given period, which is an indicator of the prospects of not receiving any shared profits in the next 
 acts as an incentive on workers in profit-sharing firms in the next period to 
period. Since an increase in 

provide a higher productivity differential, it follows that 

 reflects how valuable it is to work 

for a sharing firm. 

In  fact,  note  from  (22-a)  that 

  for  all 

 

and for any 

 (recall that the latter condition was assumed earlier to ensure a strictly positive markup for 

sharing firms in (3)). The greater the proportion of sharing firms in a given period, the smaller the productivity 
differential  between  sharing  and  non-sharing  firms  in  the next  period.  One  firm’s  decision  to  play  the profit-
sharing  strategy  in  a  given  period,  by  reducing 
,  makes  it  less  valuable  to 

  for  a  given 

workers to be employed by a sharing firm in the next period and hence has a negative payoff externality on all 
other  sharing  firms.  Consequently,  there  is  strategic  substitutability  in  the  firms’  choice  of  compensation 

                                                                                                                                                                                                     
employment.  In  fact,  using  (1)  and  (11)-(12),  the  average  employment  rate  in  the  short-run  equilibrium  is 

, where the expression in square brackets represents the weighted average 

of the inverse of the individual productivities 

 and 

. 

10  In  the  meta-analyses  in  Weitzman  and  Kruse  (1990)  and  Doucouliagos  (1995),  the  size  of  the  estimated 
effect of profit sharing on labor productivity is usually on the order of 3 to 7 percent.

Meanwhile, if all firms follow the sharing strategy 

, the relative real earnings differential 

given  by 

  vanishes.  In  this  case,  given  that  the  productivity  is  uniform  across  all 

firms,  and  should  be  higher  than  the  average  productivity  when  all  firms  pay  only  the  base  wage,  which  we 
have  normalized  to  one,  we  further  assume  that 
.  Instead,  if  all  firms  play  the  non-sharing  strategy

 takes its maximum value. In 

this case, a non-sharing firm which switches to the sharing mode is able to reap the largest possible productivity 

gain, since

convey the substance of all these properties of the productivity differential function (22-a), they are displayed

More broadly, the following intuitive rationales can be proposed for the productivity gain in (22). First, 
the  average  earnings  can  be  seen  by  a  worker  as  a  conventional  estimate  of  her  outside  option  or  fallback 
position. As a result, workers who receive a share of profits in addition to a base wage deliver a productivity 
gain (relatively to the productivity they would deliver if remunerated with only a base wage) which increases 
with  the  excess  of  the  higher  earnings  over  their  outside  option  or  fallback  position.  Second,  the  average 
earnings  can  be  seen  by  a worker  as  the  conventional  reference  point  against  which  a compensation package 
featuring  a  base  wage  and  shared  profits  should  be  compared  when  deciding  how  much  above-normal 
productivity  to  provide  in  return.  Therefore,  above-average  earnings  are  seen  by  workers  as  warranting  the 
delivery  of  above-normal  levels  of  productivity.  Blasi,  Kruse  and  Freeman  (2010)  propose  an  interesting 
rationale for profit sharing based on reciprocity and gift exchange (as these notions are articulated in Akerlof 
(1982)): a “gift” of higher compensation through profit sharing raises worker morale, and workers reciprocate 
with a “gift” of greater productivity. More generally, a “gift” of profit sharing on top of a base wage may help 
to create and reinforce a sense of shared interests and the value of a reciprocal relationship. Alternatively, the 
conventional  reference  point  provided  by  the  average  earnings  can  be  interpreted  as  reflecting  workers’ 
earnings  expectation  under  uncertainty.  Therefore,  a  compensation  package  that  features  a  base  wage  and 
shared  profits  is  greeted  as  a  pleasant  surprise  which  warrants  the  delivery  of  above-normal  levels  of 
productivity. 

While the frequency distribution of compensation strategies is given in both the ultra-short run and the 
short  run,  an  individual  firm  revises  periodically  its  compensation  strategy  in  a  manner  described  by  the 
following replicator dynamics:11 

                                                           
11  The  replicator  dynamics  can  be  formally  derived  from  a  model  of  (social  or  individual)  learning  as  in 
Weibull (1995, sec. 4.4).

(20),  and  the  latter  equality  is  obtained  using  (14)  and  (15),  so  that 

  and 

  are  given  by  (9)  and  (8), 

respectively.  According  to  the  replicator  dynamics  in (23), the frequency  of  the profit-sharing  strategy  in  the 
population of firms rises (falls) exactly when it has above-average (below-average) payoff. 

Using (8), (9) and (20), the replicator dynamics in (23) becomes: 

(23-a) 

 

. 

Thus, the state transition of the economy is determined by the system of difference equations (22-a) and (23-a), 

whose state space is

, as represented by the shaded area in each panel in 

 
We  will  show  that  the  dynamic  system  given  by  (22-a)  and  (23-a)  has  two  long-run  equilibria,  with 
each of them featuring survival of only one compensation strategy. These pure-strategy equilibria are denoted 
by 
 in the three panels in Figure 2. Moreover, we will show the possible existence of a third long-

 and 

run  equilibrium  (denoted  by

strategies.

strategy long-run equilibria of the system,

Let  us  now  explore  the  dynamics  of  the  system  towards  the  long  run  as  governed  by  the  motion 

equations (22-a) and (23-a). The 

 isocline is the locus of all the states of the set given by 

, as depicted in Figure 2. In order to know more about the 

 isocline, we can use (22-a) to compute 

.  Thus,  this  isocline  connects  the  equilibrium  solutions 

  and 

the following derivative: 

(28) 

 

. 

The  sign  of  (28)  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  pure-strategy  long-run  equilibria  (
)  can  be 
determined  by  taking  the  limit  of  (28)  as  the  state  of  the  system  approaches  each  of  these  equilibria.  These 
limits are given by:

with the sign of the second limit in (29) coming from (A-2.2) in Appendix 2. The reason why in the vicinity of 
the extinction of one worker compensation strategy, the higher is the productivity differential, the lower is the 
proportion of profit-sharing firms, is that a higher relative earnings differential is necessary to generate a higher 
productivity differential (recall that the productivity differential in (22) increases at a decreasing rate, as there is 
strategic substitutability in the firms’ choice of compensation mechanism). 

 

Meanwhile,  the 

  isocline  is  the  locus  of  all  the  states  of  the  set  given  by 

.  As  depicted  in  Figure  2,  this  set  is 

represented by a semi-inverted H-shaped isocline. 

From  the  local  stability  analysis  carried  out  in  Appendices  3-5,  the  following  results  emerge.  In  the 
configuration  depicted  in  panel  (a)  in  Figure  2,  the  productivity  gain  for  profit-sharing  firms  generated  by  a 
given relative real earnings differential is relatively low. In this case, there are only two pure-strategy long-run 
equilibria, 
,  with  all  firms 

,  with  no  firm  playing  the  profit-sharing  strategy,  and 

rather playing the profit-sharing strategy. As shown in Appendices 3 and 4, 

 is a repulsor, while 

 is an attractor. 

Meanwhile,  in  the  configuration  depicted  in  panel  (c)  in  Figure  2,  the  productivity  gain  for  profit-
sharing firms ensured by a given relative real earnings differential is relatively high. In this case, there are again 
only  two  pure-strategy  long-run  equilibria, 
,  with  all  firms  playing  the  non-sharing  strategy,  and 

, with all firms rather playing the profit-sharing strategy. As shown in Appendices 3 and 4, while 

 is an attractor, 

 is a repulsor. 

Finally, in the configuration depicted in panel (b) in Figure 2, the productivity gain for profit-sharing 
 

firms is relatively moderate. In this case, there are the same two pure-strategy long-run equilibria, 

and 

,  and  also  one  mixed-strategy  equilibrium, 

,  featuring  heterogeneity  in 

employee compensation strategies across firms. As shown in Appendices 2-5, 

 and 

 

are repulsors, while 

 is an attractor if condition (A-5.4) in Appendix 5 is satisfied (which may not 

be the case, for instance, if the short-run equilibrium capacity utilization is too high). 

Yet,  since  the  state  space  of  the  system  is  positively  invariant  (as  shown  in  Appendix  6),  in  this 
configuration  heterogeneity  in  compensation  strategies  across  firms  does  persist  in  the  long-run  even  if  the 
mixed-strategy  long-run  equilibrium  is  not  an  attractor.  This  positive  invariance  implies  that,  if  the  long-run 
equilibrium with coexistence of both compensation strategies is not an attractor, the system  keeps undergoing 
endogenous, self-sustaining and persistent fluctuations in the frequency distribution of compensation strategies 
and  the  average  productivity,  with  the  average  levels  of  the  income  shares,  capacity  utilization  and  growth 
persistently  fluctuating  as  well.  In  fact,  Mitchell  et  al.  (1990)  and  D’Art  and  Turner  (2006)  find  that  the 
adoption  of  profit  sharing  schemes  has  tended  to  be  cyclical  in  nature  in  many  advanced  countries  since  the 
origin  of  these  schemes  in  the  19th  century.  Moreover,  using  data  for  Ireland,  D’Art  and  Turner  (2006)  find 
evidence that the trend in profit sharing is affected by fluctuations in the business cycle. 

It  is  also  worth  exploring  the  long-run  equilibrium  of  income  distribution,  capacity  utilization  and 
growth in each one of these three configurations as regards the relative magnitude of the productivity gain for 
profit-sharing firms, as depicted in Figure 2. We can use (10), (20) and (21) to establish:

where the first equality in (30) and (31) follows from the fact that 

 is defined implicitly by the 

condition  given  by

exogenously  given).  In  panel  (a),  with

. Therefore, if the economy converges to a long-run 

equilibrium (which may not occur in panel (b), as shown in Appendix 5), the coupled evolutionary dynamics of 
profit-sharing  adoption  and  productivity  takes  the  economy  to  a  position  in  which  the  total  wage  share  and 
capacity utilization are at their lowest possible long-run equilibrium levels. 

 

Using (21), the long-run equilibrium values of the growth rate are given by: 

(32) 

  and   

Using (30)-(32), we can compute the following growth rate differential: 

. 

 

. Note that, given the sign of the profit share differential given by 

,  the  sign  in  (33)  depends  on  the  sign  of 

,  which  is  indeterminate  (recall  that  the 

Keynesian  short-run  stability  condition  assumed  in  footnote  8  implies  that 

  and 

).  

When  there  is  convergence  to 

  (panel  (a))  or 

  (panel  (b)),  it  follows  that 

.  In  this  case,  the  economy  converges  to  a  long-run  equilibrium  which 

features  the  highest  (lowest)  possible  long-run  equilibrium  growth  rate  if 

  (

).  Meanwhile,  when 

there is convergence to 

 (panel (c)), it follows that 

. Thus, 

  (

if 
),  the  economy  also  converges  to  the  highest  (lowest)  possible  long-run  equilibrium  growth 
rate. In sum, when the economy converges a long-run equilibrium, the latter features the highest possible long-
run equilibrium growth rate when 
. The intuition for this result is straightforward. Recall from (30)-(31) 
that,  if  the  economy  converges  to  a  long-run  equilibrium  (which  may  not  happen  in  panel  (b)),  the  latter 

features  the  lowest  possible  long-run  equilibrium  values  of  the  wage  share  in  income  (

)  and  capacity 

utilization (

). Thus, given 

 and 

, the likelihood of 

 is the higher, given the saving 

rate 

 (accelerator effect 

), the lower (higher) the accelerator effect (saving rate). Meanwhile, we can use 

(21)  to  express  the  long-run  equilibrium  growth  rate as 
.  Hence,  for  the  lowest possible  long-run 
equilibrium  value  of  the  total  wage  share  to  be  accompanied  by  the  highest  possible  long-run  equilibrium 
growth rate, the also accompanying lowest possible capacity utilization cannot be too lower than in the other 
long-run equilibria. Intuitively, the likelihood that this latter condition is satisfied, which requires that effective-

Conclusions 

This  paper  is  motivated  by  several  pieces  of  empirical  evidence.  First,  historically,  there  has  been  a 
persistent  heterogeneity  in  employee  compensation  strategies  across  firms,  and  employee  profit-sharing 
schemes have experienced a fluctuating popularity. Second, profit sharing raises labor productivity in the firm, 
and  surveys  find  that  both  employers  and  employees  usually  see  profit  sharing  as  helping  to  improve  firm 
performance in several dimensions. Third, surveys find that non-deferred and in cash profit sharing is ranked 
first by workers as motivation device. Fourth,  firms switch mechanisms of compensation frequently, with the 
gross  changes  in  mechanisms  being  far  more  numerous  than  the  net  changes.  Fifth,  profit  sharing  has  a 
meaningful  effect  on  worker  total  compensation,  which  suggests  that  profit  sharing  tends  to  come  on  top  of, 
rather than in place of, a base wage. 

We model firms as periodically choosing to compensate workers with either a base wage or a share of 
profits on top of this base wage, with the distribution of compensation strategies and labor productivity across 
firms  being  evolutionarily  time-varying.  Moreover,  we  explore  implications  of  this  coupled  evolutionary 
dynamics  for  income  distribution  (and  therefore  aggregate  effective  demand),  and  therefore  for  the  rates  of 
capacity utilization and growth. 

When the productivity gain for profit-sharing firms is relatively low, there are two long-run equilibria, 
one featuring all firms sharing profits and the other with no firm sharing profits. Yet, the former is a repulsor, 
while the latter is an attractor. When the productivity gain for profit-sharing is relatively high, the economy has 
the  same  two  long-run  equilibria.  Yet,  the  long-run  equilibrium  with  all  firms  sharing  profits  is  an  attractor, 
while the long-run equilibrium with no firm sharing profits is a repulsor. When the productivity gain for profit-
sharing firms is relatively moderate, these two long-run equilibria are joined by  another long-run equilibrium 
that  features  heterogeneity  in  worker  compensation  modes  across  firms.  In  this  case,  the  long-run  equilibria 
with  survival  of  only  one  strategy  are  repulsors,  while  the  long-run  equilibrium  with  coexistence  of  both 
strategies  is  either  an  attractor  or  a  repulsor.  However,  even  if  the  long-run  equilibrium  with  coexistence  of 
both  compensation  strategies  is  not  an  attractor,  the  economy  keeps  undergoing  endogenous,  self-sustaining 
and persistent fluctuations in the distribution of compensation modes and productivity (which accords with the 
empirical evidence), with income distribution, capacity utilization and economic growth persistently fluctuating 
as well. 

Meanwhile,  when  there  is  convergence  to  some  of  the  three  long-run  equilibria,  the  total  wage  share 
(which  includes  shared  profits)  and  capacity  utilization  become  stationary  at  their  lowest  possible  long-run 
equilibrium  values.  However,  these  lowest  possible  long-run  equilibrium  values  of  the  total  wage  share  and 
capacity utilization may be accompanied by the highest possible long-run equilibrium growth rate if effective-
demand effects are not too strong.

 for all 

 and 

. 

Finally, let us demonstrate that 

 for all 

. Given (23-a), in order to establish that 

 for 

all 

, we need to demonstrate that: 

(A-6.4) 

. 

This inequality is trivially satisfied for 

. For any 

, we can re-write (A-6.4) as: 

(A-6.5) 

. 

We can again make use of (A-6.2) and conclude that for any 

, we have: 

(A-6.6) 

. 

This completes the proof that the state space 

 is positively invariant, so that
