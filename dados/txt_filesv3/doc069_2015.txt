The  current  Brazilian  position  on  climate  change  has  been  formalized  with  the  law  of  National 
Climate Change Policy, which provides a legal framework for national actions aimed at mitigation 
and adaptation. Within PNMC, the country has defined its national voluntary reduction targets for 
greenhouse gases emissions, with reductions between 36.1% and 38.9% of projected emissions by 
2020. The distribution of the corresponding mitigation efforts by regions is of great concern in a large 
country  like  Brazil.  In  fact,  most  of  Brazilian  states  have  established  public  policies  on  climate 
change.  In  this  context,  questions  raised  in  the  literature  on  global  climate  change,  such  as  the 
environmental responsibility for emissions embodied in trade, also apply at the regional level, and 
perhaps even to a larger extent. In order to analyze at regional level the current relationship between 
Brazil’s  CO2  emissions  and  domestic  and  global  value  chains,  in  this  study  we  adopt  a  new 
framework that combines a world input-output table with an inter-regional input-output table. Also, 
a new database is compiled on Brazilian states’ energy use (by fuel) and related CO2 emissions at 
sectoral level, based on states’ official energy balances. We are able to evaluate the CO2 emissions 
in each of the 27 Brazilian states, considering their respective  productive structure, energy use, as 
well as their trade with other states or foreign countries. We find that, in 2008, emissions from the 
production  of  inter-regionally  traded  goods  and  services  corresponded  to  36%  of  Brazilian  CO2 
emissions. There is great variation among states concerning their emissions intensities and  carbon 
content of their trade relationships with their states and foreign countries. 
 
A atual posição do Brasil em relação às mudanças climáticas foi formalizada com a Lei da Política 
Nacional sobre Mudança do Clima, que estabeleceu o quadro legal para as ações nacionais voltadas 
à mitigação e à adaptação. O país também definiu suas metas voluntárias para redução das emissões 
de gases do efeito estufa, entre 36,1% e 38,9% das emissões projetadas para 2020. A distribuição 
geográfica dos esforços de mitigação é de grande interesse em um país heterogêneo como o Brasil. 
De  fato,  a  maioria  dos  estados  brasileiros  estabeleceram  políticas  oficiais  sobre  mudanças 
climáticas. Nesse contexto, questões levantadas pela literatura sobre mudanças climáticas globais, 
tais  como  a  responsabilidade  ambiental  por  emissões  incorporadas  no  comércio  internacional, 
aplicam-se também em nível regional, possivelmente em ainda maior grau. A fim de analisar em nível 
regional a relação entre emissões de CO2 e as cadeias de valor domésticas e globais, nesse estudo 
adota-se  uma  nova  abordagem  que  integra  uma  matriz  de  insumo-produto  global  e  uma  inter-
regional. Adicionalmente, construiu-se uma nova base de dados para o uso de energia (por tipo de 
combustível)  e  respectiva  emissão  de  CO2  por  setor  de  atividade  econômica  em  cada  estado  do 
Brasil, baseada nos balanços energéticos oficiais. Com isso, torna-se possível avaliar as emissões 
de CO2 nos estados, considerando as respectivas estruturas produtivas, de uso de energia, bem como 
suas relações comerciais com outros estados e países. Observou-se que as emissões provindas da 
produção de bens e serviços comercializados entre os estados corresponderam a 36% das emissões 
totais do Brasil, em 2008. Há grande variação entre os estados quanto suas intensidades de emissões, 
bem como o conteúdo de carbono de suas relações comerciais com outros estados e países.

1. Introduction 
 

The Brazilian position on climate change has been formalized with the law of National 
Climate Change Policy (PNMC, in Portuguese – Law nº 12 187, dated December 29th, 2009) 
which  provides  a  legal  framework  for  national  actions  aimed  at  mitigation  and  adaptation. 
Within PNMC, the country has defined its national voluntary reduction targets for greenhouse 
gases  (GHGs)  emissions,  advancing  from  a  merely  programmatic  policy  (LUCON; 
GOLDEMBERG, 2010) to a legal commitment with clear environmental objectives that should 
guide  subsequent  policymaking.  The  reductions  were  defined  between  36.1%  and  38.9%  of 
projected  emissions  by  2020.  As  indicated  by  Seroa  da  Motta  (2011),  sectoral  mitigation 
percentages  were  adopted in  the correspondence  from  Brazil  for  the  Copenhagen Accord  in 
2010:  out  of  the  38.9%  national  target,  deforestation  would  be  reduced  by  24.7%,  and  the 
remaining 15.2% would be divided between energy use (7.7%), agriculture and cattle raising 
(6.1%), and other sectors (0.4%).  

The distribution of the corresponding mitigation efforts by regions is of great concern 
in  a  large  country  like  Brazil,  with  substantial  regional  variation  in  economic  development, 
physical  geography,  production  system,  and  energy  consumption.  In  fact,  Brazil’s  1988 
Constitution divides responsibilities for environmental policies and legislation among the three 
levels  of  government  (PUPPIM  DE  OLIVEIRA,  2009),  and  most  of  Brazilian  states  have 
established public policies on climate change. According to NESA-USP, as of June 2015, out 
of  the  27  states  16  have  established  policies  and  four  are  underway,  having  initiated  draft 
legislation; three others have  implemented local forums to dialogue about climate change at 
state level. Only Roraima, in the North region, Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe, in 
the Northeast region, do not even have climate change forums. 

Four states have mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions: São Paulo 
and Rio de Janeiro, in the most developed Southeast region; Mato Grosso do Sul, in the Central-
West  region;  as  well  as  Paraíba,  in  the  Northeast  region.  There  are  also  advancements  in 
municipal climate change policies, the two most populous cities, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, 
have established  mandatory targets.  However, the mitigation  targets are quite different from 
each other in Brazil’s subnational climate change policies. This is not a problem in itself and 
can  be  echoing  the  principle  of  “common  but  differentiated  responsibilities”  professed  by 
PNMC at international level. However, there is no coordination concerning the different basis 
of  measurement  (absolute  values  or  intensities  in  the  case  of  Rio  de  Janeiro)  and 
incompatibilities in the baselines (different years of reference, based on inventories or projected 
emissions).  At  sectoral  level,  only  Rio  de  Janeiro  has  stated  specific  targets.  These 
characteristics  reflect  that  the  elaboration  process  of  these  subnational  policies,  which  have 
autonomously  emerged,  detached  from  each  other.  The  incongruity  between  the  targets  is 
problematic  for  economic  agents,  since  it  is  not  clear  what  the  sum  of  national,  state,  and 
municipal targets means to their activities (FÓRUM CLIMA, 2012).  

Thus, although the subnational policies indicate advances toward a less intensive effect 
on  climate  change,  there  is  room  for  improvement  in  the  regulatory  aspects.  As  stated  by 
Romeiro  and  Parente  (2011)  the  main  obstacles  include  the  lack  of  convergence  of  actions 
implemented in the various states in Brazil. There are distinct targets and strategies in the three 
spheres  of  the  country  –  federal,  state  and  municipal  –  which  makes  the  standardization  of 
mitigation measures and its respective monitoring more difficult and less effective. 

This  criticism  is  not  exclusive  to  Brazil,  but  also  applied  to  other  countries  where 
subnational climate policies have emerged. Literature concerning these policies have flourished 
in the last years, when subnational governments have taken the lead to tackle climate change in 
many countries, such as the United States (LUTSEY; SPERLING, 2008; SCHREURS, 2008). 
Although there are advantages for engagement of subnational governments in climate change

policies  –  such  as  greater  flexibility  to  implement  new  policies  (PUPPIM  DE  OLIVEIRA, 
2009),  and  the  attaining  of  efficiency  gains  from  exploitation  of  local  heterogeneities 
(SOMANATHAN et al, 2014) – most of literature agrees about the possibility of problems of 
coordination  and  complementarity,  besides  questioning  their  institutional  capacity  to  take 
action in such policies. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s  Fifth Assessment 
Report  states  that,  since  there  are  several  limiting  factors  to  a  widespread  reliance  on 
subnational levels of government, “a federal structure that provides coordination and enables 
an  easier  transmission  of  climate  policies  throughout  the  agents  of  the  economy  is  likely  to 
increase the effectiveness of actions against climate change” (SOMANATHAN et al, 2014, p. 
1183).   

The  coordination  from  top-down  policies  is  also  fundamental  for  dealing  with  an 
important  aspect  of  the  climate  issue  that  has  been  overlooked  by  policy  settings  within  all 
levels,  which  is  the  relationship  between  trade  and  greenhouse  gases  emissions.  It  is 
fundamental  to  consider  the  connections  between  economies,  as  trade  links  production  and 
consumption in different regions. As stated by Peters et al (2011), ignoring these connections 
might  result  in  a  misleading  analysis  of  underlying  driving  forces  of  emission  trends  and 
mitigation  policies.  Questions  raised  in  the  literature  on  global  climate  change,  such  as  the 
environmental  responsibility  for  emissions  embodied  in  trade  (e.g.  VALE  et  al  (2015); 
DOUGLAS;  NISHIOKA  (2012);  WIEBE  et  al  (2012);  PETERS  et  al  (2011);  DAVIS; 
CALDEIRA  (2010);  NAKANO  et  al  (2010);  SERRANO;  DIETZENBACHER  (2010); 
HERTWICH; PETERS (2008)), also apply at the regional level, and perhaps even to a larger 
extent.  

This paper analyzes the relationship between Brazilian states’ CO2 emissions and inter-
regional and international trade. In doing so, we aim to contribute to policies that account for 
such inter-relationships among regions. In this paper, we adopt a forward perspective (MENG 
et al, 2015) in analyzing the relationship between CO2 emissions and trade. That is, we aim to 
understand the responsibility of consumers for emissions embodied in  trade, evaluating what 
amount of emission generated by a state is for its own final consumption or for other states and 
foreign countries. 

A major difficulty for subnational climate change policies in Brazil is that there are very 
few  published  official  inventories  (even  though,  in  general,  all  state  policies  indicate  their 
formulation). At state level, to the best of our knowledge, only Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, 
Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo have published comprehensive GHGs inventories1. Yet 
their periodicity differs, and the adopted methodologies are not entirely consistent to each other. 
For example, how each inventory proposes accounting for emissions due to freight originating 
in the state with destination to other state (FÓRUM CLIMA, 2012). In other to deal to some 
extent with this problem, in this study we quantify CO2 emissions in each of the 27 states of 
Brazil, in the year 2008. However, we share a limitation with most of literature2 that analyzes 
the  relationship  between  international trade  and  GHGs  emissions:  we  account  here  for  CO2 
emissions due only to energy use (combustion of fossil fuels).  

According to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) (2014),  in 
2008 energy use accounted for about 18% of total GHGs  emissions in  Brazil.  However, the 

                                                             
1 Other states have published official inventories that comprehend only some emission sectors: Amazonas (electric 
power  sector),  Bahia  (energy  sector  and  industrial  processes).  Although  comprehensive,  the  inventory  of  Acre 
covers only electric power generation and emissions from automobiles in the energy sector. 
2 For example, Douglas and Nishoka (2012), Wiebe et al (2012), Davis and Caldeira (2010), and Nakano et al 
(2010) account only for CO2 emissions due to combustion of fossil fuels, as we do in this study. Peters et al (2011) 
also consider CO2 emissions from cement production .and gas flaring. Hertwich and Peters (2009) consider GHGs, 
not including the sources and sinks of land-use change, which is the same as in the WIOD project. Besides the 
absence  of  data  on  land-use  change  and  other  GHGs  with  the  necessary  detail,  the  authors  indicate  that  other 
sources present difficulties for allocation to economic activities.

climate impact of the energy sector is foreseen to grow in the next years. Decree nº 7 390, dated 
December 9th, 2010, which regulates PNMC, presents official projections for GHGs emissions 
in  Brazil,  for  the  year  2020.  According  to  them,  the  GHGs  emissions  due  to energy  use  are 
estimated to be 868,000 Gg in 2020 (about 140% larger than in 2008), amounting in 27% of 
total  projected  GHGs  emissions.  In  fact,  data  of  recent  years  show  an  even  more  relevant 
participation of emissions due to energy use. In 2012, it accounted for about 37% of total GHGs 
emissions (MCTI, 2014), given the sharp decline of emissions due to land-use change especially 
in Amazon region, from 2009. Given the increasing importance of energy use for the Brazilian 
GHGs scenario and its central role in global emissions, its climate impact and their relationship 
with the economic activities must be studied. 

Besides  this  Introduction,  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  section  2  presents  the 
methodology used in the empirical analysis, as well as the newly compiled database. Results 
are then analyzed in section 3. Then, the last section presents some our concluding remarks. 
 
2. Methodology 
 
2.1. Estimating the country-state input-output table 
 

 

In  order  to  analyze  at  regional  level  the  current  relationship  between  Brazil’s  CO2 
emissions and domestic and global value chains, in this study we adopt the framework proposed 
by Dietzenbacher et al (2013) for combining a world input-output table (WIOT) with an inter-
regional  input-output  table  (IRIOT),  thus  estimating  a  country-state  input-output  table  for 
Brazil. In this approach, we do not to take one of the datasets (say the WIOT) as a starting point 
and adapt the other dataset (i.e. the IRIOT) accordingly, instead we construct input coefficients 
for which both datasets are used. 

For the empirical application, we will use the WIOT for 2008 that was constructed in 
the WIOD project (see Dietzenbacher et al, 2013b).3 It is a full inter-country input-output table 
covering  40  countries  and  the  rest  of  the  world  as  a  41st  “country”.4  One  of  the  countries 
included  is  Brazil.  The  IRIOT  for  2008  is  for  Brazil  and  covers  the  27  Brazilian  states 
(GUILHOTO et al, 2010). Both the WIOT and the IRIOT were aggregated to 28 compatible 
industries. 
 
2.2. CO2 emissions data for Brazilian states 
 

In this paper, we account for CO2 emissions due to fossil fuels5 in the economic sectors. 
It also embodies the CO2 emissions that are generated in thermal power plants, as well as that 
from the use of coke in iron and steel mills. Adopting a bottom-up approach, we were able to 
obtaining  the  levels  of  CO2  emissions  by  industry  at  the  state  level  in  Brazil.  For  the  other 
countries in our model, we have considered the data on CO2 emission from the WIOD project. 
First, we have departed from the Brazilian Energy Balance (EPE, 2009) and reconciled 
the data from state energy balances accordingly. For the year 2008, official energy balances are 
available for  the following states:  Alagoas, Bahia,  Goiás, Minas  Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São 

                                                             
3  The  full  database  from  the  WIOD  project  (including  a  time  series  of  WIOTs)  is  publicly  and  free  of  charge 
available at: http://www.wiod.org/database/index.htm. 
4 The countries in the WIOD’s world input-output tables are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, 
China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, 
Ireland,  Italy,  Japan,  Korea,  Latvia,  Lithuania,  Luxembourg,  Malta,  Mexico,  Netherlands,  Poland,  Portugal, 
Romania,  Russia,  Slovak  Republic,  Slovenia,  Spain,  Sweden,  Taiwan,  Turkey,  United  Kingdom,  and  USA 
(Dietzenbacher et al, 2013). 
5  The  following  fuels  were  taken  into  account:  natural  gas,  steam  coal,  metallurgical  coal,  diesel  oil,  fuel  oil, 
gasoline, LPG, kerosene, gas coke, coal coke, other oil by-products, and coal tar.

Paulo, Paraná, and Rio Grande do Sul. For Ceará and Espírito Santo, we have considered the 
participation in the national energy use and sectors’ fuel structure from the energy balances of 
2007 and 2010, respectively.  

Following Montoya et al (2014), the data on fossil fuel use (in tOE) from the energy 
balances was then reconciled with the industry classification of Brazil’s IRIOT. Next, we have 
estimated  the  corresponding  CO2  emissions  by  adopting  the  carbon  emission  factors  and 
oxidation fractions from the Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions and Removals of 
Greenhouse Gases (MCTI, 2010).  

By adopting this approach, about 75% of Brazil’s CO2 emissions due to energy use in 
2008 were attributed to the ten aforementioned states that publish official energy balances. The 
differences from the national total by sector were allocated to the other states according to their 
respective gross output.  

In our application, the CO2 emissions due to households’ direct use of fossil fuels are 
disregarded (approximately 9% of the national emissions). Instead, we focus on the emissions 
that are generated by the various economic industries in their productive activities. 
 
2.3. Trade in CO2 emissions (TiCE) 
 

To  investigate  the  inter-regional  (and  international)  spillover  of  CO2  emissions,  we 
adapt and apply the concept of trade in value added (TiVA) for our country-state input-output 
system. 

From the basic Leontief model, the total output of an economy can be expressed as the 

sum of intermediate consumption and final consumption (MILLER; BLAIR (2009)) as 

𝐱 = 𝐀𝐱 + 𝐲 
(𝐈 − 𝐀)−𝟏 = 𝐁   
𝐱 = 𝐁𝐲   

(1) 
(2) 
(3) 

𝐯 = 𝐂𝐱 

𝐯 = 𝐂𝐁𝐲 
𝐂𝐁 = 𝐆 
𝐯 = 𝐆𝐲 

Considering  𝐂  as  the  n×n  diagonal  matrix  of  CO2  emissions  coefficients,  we  can 

where 𝐱 is the n×1 total output vector (n is the number of industries in the system), 𝐀 is the 
n×n direct input coefficients matrix, 𝐲 is the n×1 final demand vector, and 𝐁 is the Leontief 
inverse matrix.  
 
describe the CO2 emissions related input-output model as: 
 
from (3): 
 
 
 
where 𝐯 is the n×1 CO2 emissions vector, and 𝐆 is the CO2 emissions related Leontief inverse. 
In our empirical analysis, we applied a state-country input-output model. In this case, 
the  above  system  can  be  expanded,  considering  r  states  /  countries,  in  such  a  way  that  it  is 
possible to estimate the contribution of the final demand in each state / country to the total CO2 
emission of a given state / country. In this way, the dimensions of the above matrices and vectors 
become: a) 𝐗, 𝐘, and 𝐕, size [(r.n) × r]; b) 𝐀, 𝐁, and 𝐆, size (r.n) × (r.n).  
 
the matrix 𝐆 above can be decomposed as follows: 

With the aim of analyzing the state / country interdependence in terms of CO2 emission,

In equation (8), the elements of the first term of the sum can be regarded as intra-regional 
 
effects,  representing  impacts  on the  CO2  emissions  of  sectors  of a  region  due  to exogenous 
changes in final demand of the same region. On the other hand, the elements of the second term

of the sum can be regarded as spillover effects, representing impacts on the CO2 emissions of 
sectors of a region due to exogenous changes in final demand of the other region.  

In a state-country input-output framework, equation (7) can be represented as: 

𝐆11 … 𝐆1r

⋱

⋮
𝐆r1 … 𝐆rr

⋮

[𝐯∙1 … 𝐯∙r] = [

] [𝐲∙1 … 𝐲∙r] 

(9) 

In  the  above  equation,  considering  for  example  region  1,  the  vector 𝐯∙1  [(r.n)  ×  1] 
represents the contribution of region 1 to the total CO2 emissions in each one of the r states / 
countries and n sectors considered in the model, given the final demand  𝐲∙1 of this region.  

The vector  𝐯∙1 in equation (9) comprehends the inflows / imports6 of CO2 emissions of 
region 1 from other states / countries (besides its own contribution for its own  value added, 
given by the elements from 1 to n). For example, the elements from n+1 to 2n correspond to its 
inflows / imports of CO2 emissions from each of the  n sectors of region 2 (accordingly, the 
outflows / exports of CO2 emissions from region 2 to region 1). Thus equation (9) represents 
the consumption-based accounting principle with the multiregional input-output method (see 
PEI et al (2015); PETERS et al (2011); DAVIS; CALDEIRA (2010)).  
 
3. Main results 
 
3.1. Traded components of global CO2 emissions 
 

As  can  be  expected  for  a  country  as  heterogeneous  as  Brazil,  the  values  of  traded 
components of CO2 emissions vary greatly among the Brazilian states, as Table 17 presents. 
The states in the Southeast region (Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo) 
presented  the  greatest  sums  of  domestically  consumed,  inter-regionally  and  internationally 
traded  CO2  emissions.  They  amounted  in  respectively  54%,  52%  and  59%  of  the  country’s 
total. São Paulo’s shares were the largest, except concerning the exports of CO2 emissions to 
foreign countries, in which Minas Gerais took the lead.  

Considering the results for TiCE in Brazil in relation to those of other countries globe, 
its figures are quite small. Concerning the relationship of Brazilian states and foreign countries, 
as seen in the second and third columns of Table 1, the largest amounts of exports to and imports 
from Brazilian states corresponded to countries that are not individually treated in our model 
(i.e.  the  “rest  of  the  world”  region).  However,  it  is  notable  that  China’s  exports  of  CO2  to 
Brazilian states represented almost 30% of this component.  

From the TiCE results, as highlighted in Chart 1, we have quantified the importance of 
international trade in global CO2 emissions. In 2008, 28% of global CO2 emissions, or 6.6 Gt 
CO2,  were  attributed  to  international  trade.  This  is  close  to  the  findings  of  other  authors 
(PETERS  et  al  (2011):  26%;  DAVIS;  CALDEIRA  (2010):  23%).  China’s  exports  of  CO2 
emissions  alone  represented  31%  of  the  internationally  traded  emissions,  or  9%  of  global 
emissions.  

Emissions from the production of inter-regionally traded goods and services in Brazil 
amounted  in  36%  of  the  country’s  territorial  (or  production-based)  CO2  emissions. 
International trade was slightly less relevant to Brazilian emissions than the world average, as 
25% of its territorial CO2 emissions were attributed to its exports to foreign countries. 

                                                             
6  In  this  paper,  we  distinguish  between  “inflows”  /  “outflows”,  regarding  trade  among  domestic  states,  and 
“imports” / “exports”, regarding trade between states and foreign countries, or between foreign countries. 
7 In this section, for better presentation, we have aggregated some of the countries in our model as “Other EU27” 
(Austria,  Belgium,  Bulgaria,  Cyprus,  Czech  Republic,  Denmark,  Estonia,  Finland,  Greece,  Hungary,  Ireland, 
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, and 
Sweden) and as “Other countries + RoW” (Australia, Indonesia, Turkey, and ROW).

Inter-regional and international trade are more relevant for the generation of global and 
Brazil’s CO2 emissions than for value added, which is emphasized comparing the figures for 
trade  in  value  added  (TiVA).  In  2008,  20%  of  global  value  added  were  attributed  to 
international traded (versus 28% for CO2 emissions). In Brazil, inter-regional trade responded 
to 27% of the country’s value added (versus 36% for CO2 emissions). The greater relevance of 

 

8 

inter-regional trade for generating CO2 emissions (in comparison with value added) also holds 
for every state in Brazil.

3.2. Production-based and consumption-based CO2 emissions 
 

 

In order to quantify the emission transfers via inter-regional and international trade, we 
rearrange  the  results  of  TiCE  presented  in  Table  1.  For  computing  the  production-based 
emissions, we sum the components “domestic”, “exports (outflows) to Brazilian regions”, and 
“exports  to  foreign  countries”.  For  consumption-based  emissions,  “domestic”,  “imports 
(inflows)  from  Brazilian  regions”,  and  “imports  from  foreign  countries”.  The  difference 
between  production-based  and  consumption-based  emissions  is  defined  as  “net  emission 
transfer”  via  trade  (PETERS  et  al,  2011).  Here,  we  are  considering  the  transfers  via 
international and inter-regional trade inside Brazil. Thus the net emissions transfer corresponds 
to  CO2  emissions  in  each  region  (state  or  country)  to  produce  goods  and  services  that  are 
ultimately consumed in a different region minus the emissions in other regions to produce goods 
and services that are ultimately consumed in the first region. Following the sign convention as 
for an economic balance of trade, net exports are positive and net imports are negative.  The 
results are presented in Table 2. 

For the Brazilian states, where emission transfers also happen via inter-regional trade, 
out of 27 states seven were sources of net emission transfer to other states or foreign countries. 
Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais were outstanding net exporters of CO2 emissions. São Paulo, 
the  greatest  emitter  in  the  country  both  production  and  consumption-based,  was  also  the 
recipient of the largest net emission transfer. These results are analyzed with further detail in 
sub-section 3.4. 

Considering  Brazil  as  a  whole,  its  consumption-based  emissions  surpassed  its 
production-based emissions, so that it received net emission transfers via international trade. 
This is dissimilar for other BRICs countries, which presented positive net emission transfer via 
international  trade.  Especially  China,  with  net  exports  emissions  amounting  in  1.6  Gt  CO2. 
Concerning the countries included in the Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol and that are treated 
individually in our model, each of them (with exception of Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Poland, 
and  Russia)  received  net  emission  transfers  via  international  trade.  This  finding  adds  to  the 
literature  about  the  inadequacy  of  the  territorial  principle  for  mitigation  targets  under  a 
fragmented, two-tier mitigation strategy as in Kyoto Protocol (PETERS et al, 2011).  

Table 3 breaks down these results by groups of trade partners (domestic components, 
Brazilian  states,  and  foreign  countries).  It  shows  there  was  great  variation  concerning  the 

 

9 

importance of both inter-regional and international traded components among both Brazilian 
states and foreign countries.

As indicated previously, 36% of the Brazilian production-based CO2 emissions were 
attributed to inter-regional trade. Among the states, this ranges from 17%, in Amapá, to 60%, 
in Amazonas. The internationally traded component of CO2 emissions also has great variance 
among the states, corresponding to shares of production-based CO2 emissions that range from 

 

10 

4%, in Distrito  Federal, to 55% in Pará. Its importance in Espírito Santo is also outstanding 
(49% of production-based CO2 emissions in this state), so that only 10% of this state’s CO2 
emisions were due to its own final demand.

Among the foreign countries in Table 3, Taiwan is where international trade presented 
the most important role in production-based CO2 emissions (52%). Although China was the 
largest  exporter  of  CO2  emissions  in  the  world,  in  this  country  the  internationally  traded 

 

11 

component was (slightly) less important than in, for example, Germany and Korea, given the 
dimension  of  the  Chinese  domestic  final  demand.  This  observation  also  applies  to  the 
importance of the internationally traded component of CO2 emissions in  the USA, from the 
consumption perspective: although they are by far the greatest importer of CO2 emissions, the 
internationally traded component is more relevant to the EU countries, for example. 
 
3.3. Intensity of CO2 emissions 

 

In  addition  to  analyzing  the  magnitude  of  production  and  consumption-based  CO2 

emissions, for policy purposes it is relevant to assess the intensity of emissions.  

In  addition  to  analyzing  the  magnitude  of  production  and  consumption-based  CO2 
emissions, for policy purposes it is relevant to assess the intensity of emissions. For production-
based emissions, their intensity can be evaluated by the ratio between the total emissions and 
the total value added in a region. The Brazilian economy was less intensive in production-based 
CO2 emissions than the world average (0.21 thousand ton of CO2 per US$ million of value 
added in 2008) and all the developing countries depicted in Table 4. The other three BRICs, 
notably China, presented production-based CO2 intensities much larger than the world average 
in 2008.  

For the Brazilian states, it is relevant that São Paulo, the main state in economic terms, 
presented  an  intensity  of  production-based  CO2  emissions  that  was  quite  smaller  than  the 
national average (0.15 thousand ton of CO2 per US$ million of value added). On the other hand, 
the three highest intensities corresponded to Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and Bahia, in that 
order. In Espírito Santo, it was 0.56 thousand ton of CO2 per US$ million of value added, thus 
above the world average.   

As for consumption-based CO2 emissions, their intensities can be assessed in per capita 
terms. The results are presented in Table 4. Among the 40 countries in our model, per capita 
consumption-based  CO2  emissions  vary  from  1.03  ton  per  person  per  year  (py)  for  India  to 
16.54 ton / py for the USA. In Brazil, the lowest intensity corresponded to Alagoas (0.77 ton / 
py), while Distrito Federal was the other extreme (4.51 ton / py, above the world average). 

As Peters et al (2011) also observed, the per capita consumption-based CO2 emissions 
are strongly correlated with per capita final demand expenditures. Using a regression of log-
transformed  data,  we  derived  its  elasticity.  Considering  the  countries  in  our  model,  CO2 
emissions strongly increase with final demand expenditures as can be seem in Figure 3, with 
an elasticity ε = 0.63 (R² = 0.84). Therefore, as countries become wealthier its consumption-
based  CO2  emissions  increase  by  63%  for  each  doubling  of  per  capita  final  demand 
expenditure.  Since  the  elasticity  is  less  than  one,  the  intensity  of  consumption-based  CO2 
emissions decreases with final demand expenditures. 

Applying this exercise to Brazilian states (Figure 4), we obtained an elasticity ε = 0.87 
(R² = 0.86), which is larger than when we consider countries. Thus the increase in consumption-
based  CO2  emissions  is  greater  as  states  become  wealthier.  However,  the  intensity  of 
consumption-based emissions still decreases with final demand expenditures.

3.4. Brazilian states’ inter-regional and international trade in CO2 emissions 

 

In this sub-section, we analyze with further detail the results for Brazilian states’ TiCE, 
since  it  is  relevant  for  policy  purposes  to  identify  and  quantify  the  most  important  CO2 
emissions flows, between each pair of trade partners. 

Table A1, in the Annex, summarizes the inter-regional flows in CO2 emissions, with 
aggregation across the 28 industries of our model. An important share of Brazil’s inter-regional 
TiCE (23%) took place among the states in the Southeast region. São Paulo is dominant in the 
inter-regional trade in CO2 emissions, responding for 22% of outflows and 21% of inflows of 
emissions in Brazil. For all the states, São Paulo is the most important source of inter-regional 
TiCE  and,  except  for  Roraima,  Alagoas,  and  Distrito  Federal,  it  is  also  the  most  important 
destination. São Paulo’s most important trade partners (in CO2 emission terms) are the other 
states in the Southeast region, for which São Paulo sources 37% of its outflows and from which 
it acquires 44% of its inflows. The key emission flows from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro and 
from Minas Gerais to São Paulo alone amounted respectively in 5% and 4% of Brazil’s inter-
regional TiCE. However, it is noteworthy that comparing this with the results from the TiVA 
analysis (DIETZENBACHER et al, 2013) reveals that São Paulo’s dominance is less intense 
in terms of emissions  – the state responded for the larger share of 37% of outflows in value 
added  terms.  This  is  because  São  Paulo  presents  a  low  consumption-based  CO2  emissions 

 

14 

intensity, as presented in Table 4. Despite such low intensity, São Paulo’s inter-regional trade 
flows (in value added terms) are so large that the state also takes the lead in TiCE. 

On the other hand, Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais are more relevant as sources for 
inter-regional TiCE (than for TiVA). This is largely due to the large amounts of CO2 emission 
that are generated in their “Mining and Quarrying” and “Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal” 
sectors in response to the final demands of other states. For both states, Rio de Janeiro and São 
Paulo were the most important destinations of their outflows, concentrating more than 46% of 
them.  

In fact, the highest intensity of CO2 corresponds to the flows from Espírito Santo: on 
average, for each US$ one million of value added due other states’ final demand, 0.78 thousand 
ton of CO2 emissions was produced there (in the whole inter-regional system, the average was 
0.28  thousand  ton  of  CO2  emissions  /  US$  one  million  of  value  added).  Bahia’s  outflows 
presented the second highest CO2 intensity, 0.49 thousand ton of CO2 emissions / US$ one 
million of value added, quite below Espírito Santo’s.  

From  the  data  in  Table  A1,  we  can  compute  the  net  emission  transfers  between  the 
states. Due to space limitation, here we only describe some of the main results. Espírito Santo 
was a source of net emission transfers to every other state in Brazil. Its largest surplus was with 
São Paulo (1.9 thousand ton of CO2). Surpluses of TiCE were also verified for Amazonas with 
all trade partners in Brazil (except Espírito Santo). The latter result is mainly due to the Free 
Trade Zone of Manaus, which comprehends an industrial hub directed to the demand of the rest 
of the country. In the case of São Paulo, differently for what was observed considering TiVA 
(DIETZENBACHER  et  al,  2013),  when  the  state  presented  surpluses  with  all  other  states 
(except  Amazonas),  here  the  sum  of  its  deficits  (especially  with  Espírito  Santo  and  Minas 
Gerais) greatly compensates its surpluses in inter-regional trade in CO2 emissions. This results 
in its positive net emissions transfer to other states amounting in only 3% of its consumption-
based CO2 emissions. On the other hand, the state that received the largest net emission transfer 
via  inter-regional  trade  was  Distrito  Federal,  what  is  comprehensible  given  its  limited 
productive structure and its high final demand expenditures. In 2008, it received 3,610 thousand 
tons of CO2 from other states, in net terms (corresponding to 66% of its production-based CO2 
emissions). 

The  states’  exports  and  imports  in  CO2  emissions  are  respectively  detailed  by  trade 
partner in Tables A2 and A38, in the Annex. According to Table A2, the main exporter of CO2 
emissions was Minas Gerais (almost 19% of the national exports), which surpassed São Paulo 
(about 17% of national exports). Corresponding to approximately 12.5%, Espírito Santo also 
stands out. Concerning the exports by trade partners, the largest share (34%) corresponded to 
the group of countries “Other + ROW”, being followed by EU 27 (25.2%), USA (18.4%) and 
China (8.7%). However, this ranking of trade partners does not hold for every state. For Pará 
and Espírito Santo, the USA are more important destination of exports of CO2 than EU27. 

It is interesting that, on average,  Brazil’s exports are more intense in CO2 emissions 
than its inter-regional flows (0.38 thousand ton of CO2 emissions / US$ one million of exported 
value added versus 0.28 in inter-regional trade). As observed for total production-based CO2 
emissions  and  inter-regional  outflows,  the  intensity  of  Espírito  Santo’s  exports  of  CO2 
emissions was the highest in Brazil (1.08 thousand ton of CO2 emissions / US$ one million of 
exported value added, on average). We observe that the average CO2 intensity varies with the 

                                                             
8 In the next Tables, for better presentation, the countries in our model are classified as follows: CHN: China; IND: 
India,  RUS:  Russia;  USA:  United  States;  MEX:  Mexico;  CAN:  Canada;  DEU:  Germany;  ESP:  Spain;  FRA: 
France; GBR:  United Kingdom; ITA:  Italy;  Other EU27: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, 
Denmark,  Estonia,  Finland,  Greece,  Hungary,  Ireland,  Lithuania,  Luxembourg,  Latvia,  Malta,  Netherlands, 
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, and Sweden;  JPN: Japan; KOR: Korea; TWN: Taiwan; 
ther + ROW: Australia, Indonesia, Turkey, and ROW.

trade partner. So, in Brazil as whole, USA’s final demand generates a higher CO2 / value added 
ratio  than  China’s  or  EU27’s  (0.44  thousand  ton  of  CO2  emissions  /  US$  one  million  of 
exported value added versus 0.37). 

São  Paulo  was  largely  dominant  in  the  imports  in  CO2  emissions  (31%  of  national 
imports). In fact, the emission transfer of foreign countries to São Paulo greatly surpassed those 
via  inter-regional  trade,  i.e.  the  final  demand  of  São  Paulo  had  a  greater  impact  in  CO2 
emissions of foreign countries than in other states of Brazil. Thus the main sources of emission 
transfer to São Paulo were the group “Other + ROW”, China, EU27, and the USA, before even 
the states in Brazilian southeast region. The group “Other  + ROW” and China produced the 
largest amounts of CO2 emissions in foreign countries due to Brazilian states’ final demand 
(34% and 28%, respectively), being followed by EU27 (12%) and the USA (9%).  

Concerning  the  CO2  intensities  of  Brazilian  states’  imports  of  CO2  emissions,  it  is 
noticeable that BRICs exports to Brazil presented quite high CO2 / value added ratio. In the 
case of China, for example, each US$ one million of exported value added to Brazilian states 
embodied  1.46  thousand  ton  of  CO2  emissions.  This  reflects  the  high  intensity  of  the 
production-based CO2 emissions in these countries, as presented in Table 4. 

Combining the data in Tables A2 and A3, we obtain the net emission transfers relating 
Brazilian states and foreign countries. São Paulo received a large net emission transfer from 
foreign countries in 2008 (20,046 thousand tons). In fact, from the countries depicted in Tables 
A2 and A3, São Paulo presented net imports with all of the (except Mexico, Spain, and France). 
On the other hand, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, and Pará were important net exporters of CO2 
emissions to foreign countries. Especially Espírito Santo, which was a source of net emission 
transfers amounting in 7,107 thousand tons CO2. Considering the foreign trade partners, the 
BRICs and the group “Other + ROW” were sources of net emission transfers to almost every 
state in Brazil. China outstands, presenting a total net emission transfer of 23,327 thousand tons 
to Brazilian states. On the other hand, the countries from UE27 and the USA were net importers 
of CO2 emissions in Brazil as a whole. 
 
4. Concluding Remarks 
 

The emergence of the global value chains, resulting in many of today’s products and 
services  being  no  longer  produced  within  a  single  country,  raises  many  relevant  questions. 
Among  them,  what  are  the  environmental  effects  of  fragmentation  of  production,  including 
those with global scale, such as the emission of GHGs? Given the inter-regional fragmentation 
of  production,  these  questions  also  apply  at  the  regional  level,  and  perhaps  even  to  a  larger 
extent. The present paper aimed to contribute to this discussion, analyzing the CO2 emissions 
in the Brazilian states in the context of global and domestic value chains.  

Since  the  fragmentation  of  production  processes  leads  to  an  interdependent  structure 
which  has  to  be  accounted  for,  the  input-output  methodology  is  especially  suitable.  In  our 
analysis,  we  combined  a  world  input-output  table  with  an  inter-regional  input-output  table. 
From this we obtained a model covering the interdependence of 27 Brazilian states and 40 other 
countries (with the rest of the world as a country) in 2008, with the economic structures  and 
corresponding CO2 emissions arranged in 28 industries.  

A central finding of our analysis is that, next to 28% of global emissions being embodied 
in international trade, 36% of territorial emissions in Brazil were traded between states. Thus, 
international and inter-regional trade play an important role in emissions, and thus should be 
weighted in the elaboration of climate change policies.   

The quantification of consumption-based emissions produces an alternative indicator to 
the  territorial  principle  that  guides  the  mitigation  commitments  in  current  international 
agreements.  However,  arguably  it  goes  from  an  extreme  to  another,  shifting  the  burden  of 

 

16 

mitigation  entirely  from  producers  (that  benefit  from  economic  activity  in  their  territory)  to 
finals  consumers.  As  an  intermediate  solution,  consumption-based  indicators  may  help 
establishing  differentiate  commitments  that  are  trade-adjusted,  adhering  to  the  principle  of  
“common but differentiated responsibilities”. Also, consumption-based indicators can be used 
to identify priority mitigation activities under a “Clean Development Mechanism” in areas that 
are source of exports / outflows of CO2 emissions. 

This is not possible under the current framework of subnational climate change policies 
in Brazil, which autonomously emerged and are fundamentally detached from each other. Since 
to achieve a nation-wide goal of mitigation inter-regional carbon leakage has to be taken into 
consideration, coordination among the interlinked economies is fundamental. In fact, a central 
arrangement is easier inside countries, than at global level,  since the federal government can 
design policies gathering the subnational regions.  

Our  study  indicated  many  heterogeneities  among  Brazilian  states  concerning  CO2 
emissions. There is great variation on production and consumption-based emission intensities, 
as well very different carbon contents in the inter-regional and international trade flows. Such 
points should be considered in the design of climate policies and they indicate possible paths 
for  reducing  emissions.  For  example,  the  existence  of  different  production-based  emission 
intensities  brings  out  the  possibility  of  technology  transfers  as  mitigation  strategy.  The 
verification  of  decreasing  consumption-based  emissions  as  states  become  wealthier  leads  to 
questioning where it is due to better technology, structural change of what is consumed, or some 
other  factor  that  can  be  appropriated  by  mitigation  policies.  Identifying  the  most  important 
flows in inter-regional trade in emissions can ground environmental agreements between states. 
In this way, the present study may contribute to the elaboration of commitments based not only 
on political negotiations, but also in scientific and economic analysis.
