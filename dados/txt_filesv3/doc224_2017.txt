Abstract

In this paper we evaluate the impact of grade span conﬁguration on student outcomes. Using a Brazilian dataset
that contains student achievement information and socioeconomic questionnaires, we analyzed 5th-grade students
performances of elementary schools (1st to the 5th grade), compared to students of elementary-middle schools (6th
to the 9th grade). To do so, we used Propensity Score Matching methodologies to control possible biases. We
ﬁnd that elementary schools have better results in Portuguese language and mathematics standardized score tests,
higher passing rates and lower dropout rates than elementary-middle schools. We also ran tests and alternative
speciﬁcations that indicate the robustness of our estimates. We found evidence that alternative pedagogical practices
and school management policies for teachers may explain the ﬁndings.

Introduction

1
Over the last decades, Brazil has been facing a profound change in its demographic structure.
While the number of elderly people is increasing, the number of children has been falling due
to the reduction in fertility rate. Although this change in the age pyramid is a macroeconomic
challenge in the short term, it can provide opportunities to enhance per student expenditure in
terms of education to the younger population. Figure (1) shows the reduction in enrollment in
elementary and middle school in the last 10 years. It is important to note that the attendance
rate did not decrease during this period.

Bearing in mind Brazilian demographic phenomenon, the question regarding what to do with
schools that have few students enrolled arises. The ﬁrst and simplest answer to this question would
be to close these schools and relocate their students. The second possibility would be to change
the school grade span conﬁguration by separating the elementary school (1st to the 5th grade)
from the middle school (6th to the 9th grade). The latter proposal has been considered in Brazil
during the last years.1 This issue became even more debated in Brazil with the publication of
Decree No. 61672, November 30, 2015, by the Government of the State of São Paulo. The decree
authorized the process of grade span conﬁguration for state public schools. This proposal, however,
was revoked in May 2016 (Decree No. 61962) due to both the absence of studies measuring the
possible impacts of this policy on Brazilian students and public pressure.

The main supporting argument is that the school reorganization would be beneﬁcial by pro-
viding more speciﬁc pedagogical plans, increasing the specialization of principals and teachers.
It is also expected that these schools have students with more homogeneous characteristics. The
empirical evidence is that heterogeneous classes negatively aﬀect student’s individual achievements
(Hanushek et al. (2003); Hattie (2002)).

A similar process occurred in the United States in the mid-20th century. Nowadays most
students switch from elementary school to middle school before entering high school. The eﬀects
of this transition have been widely studied empirically and evidence shows that switching schools
negatively aﬀects school outcomes. Looking thoroughly to academic achievement, studies have
shown that this transition negatively aﬀects mathematics and reading scores (Byrnes e Ruby
(2007); Oﬀenberg (2001); Rockoﬀ e Lockwood (2010)). The literature also shows that school
change aﬀects non-academic outcomes (Schwerdt e West (2013); Weiss e Bearman (2007)). The
most discussed mechanism for these ﬁndings is the transition period when students are adolescents
and several behavioral changes are simultaneously happening. The long-term eﬀects, however,
are not considered by this literature. The potential beneﬁts of the grade span conﬁguration on
academic achievement may not be immediate. Dove et al. (2010) investigate the eﬀects of this
policy on school achievement measured by the Arkansas Benchmark Examination for sixth-grade
students. The study reveals that there are positive eﬀects on math proﬁciency tests after the
second year of transition. There is no evidence of eﬀects on the achievement in literacy.

There are two factors common to these studies, however. The ﬁrst is that they analyze only the
case of American schools. The second is that they evaluate students after the transition to middle
school. We did not ﬁnd studies that seek to investigate, before transition, the possible positive

eﬀects for early students of elementary school specialization.

In the present study, we use the largest education dataset in Brazil to measure the eﬀect of grade
span conﬁguration on 5th grade students enrolled in Brazilian Public School System. We focus our
analysis on four diﬀerent outcomes: achievement in math and reading, passing and dropout rates.
We ﬁnd that achievements are signiﬁcantly higher as well as passing rate for elementary schools
compared to elementary-middle schools. We also ﬁnd that the dropout rate is smaller for the
elementary schools. In order to estimate the causal eﬀects we employ the strategy of Propensity
Score Matching to compare outcomes from 5th grade students enrolled in elementary schools and
elementary-middle schools. We also run regressions to analyze possible channels through which
school specialization may improve school outcomes of 5th grade students. Principals of these
schools seem to diversify pedagogical practices and conduct management that beneﬁts teachers.
We believe that the ﬁndings of this study generate signiﬁcant impacts for future public policy
proposals. This paper also shed some light on the ongoing debate in São Paulo despite further
studies are needed.

The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we describe our data. Section 3 explains
the methodology used. Section 4 describes our main ﬁndings. In the section 5 we present some
tests to check the robustness of the results and section 6 concludes.

2 The dataset
For the purpose of this study, we had to classify which schools qualiﬁed for treatment or control
groups, to do that we used data from the National Institute for Educational Studies and Research
(INEP), which is related to the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC). In order to deﬁne which

Scholar Census waves, the number of students enrolled in each grade of each Brazilian school.
With this data, we could split our treatment and control groups.

With this data, to classify which group is which, there’s some need to understand how the
Brazilian educational system works. First of all, home-schooling is not allowed, therefore this
analysis of the Census data captured every student present from the 1st to the 9th grade. Accord-
ing to the UNESCO’s International Standard Classiﬁcation of Education (ISCED), Brazilian’s
Fundamental School (also known as elementary-middle school) is divided into elementary school2,
from the 1st to the 5th grade, and middle school3, that gathers students from the 6th to the 9th
grade. Our deﬁnition of treatment and control groups was based in schools that were only ele-
mentary schools (treatment group), against schools that were elementary-middle schools (control
group).

Having designed the control and treatment groups, we imported, from the same source, the
2013 and 2015 waves of SAEB (Basic Education Assessment System), a biennial survey applied
to every student enrolled in public schools, known as Prova Brasil, and in the form of samples for
students enrolled in private schools, known as Anresc. This evaluation gives us an idea about the
achievement of the students in the 5th and 9th grade. For this study, we analyzed only data from
public schools with students that were completing the elementary school, therefore, 5th graders.

All the variables used to gather the results came from this two datasets (SAEB and Scholar
Census), except for the variable that deﬁnes the per capita GDP, which was extracted from the
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, in Portuguese).

3 Methodology
We can deﬁne Y1i as the outcome of school i if it is treated (elementary school) and Y0i as the
outcome of that school if it is not exposed to the treatment (elementary-middle school). The
average treatment eﬀect (ATE) for a particular school i can be written as:

(1)
However, as it is impossible to assign the same school to both conditions, an alternative form of
evaluation is the average treatment eﬀect on treated (ATT). Let Z (Z∈{0, 1}) be an indicator
variable denoting the treatment received (Z = 1 is when the school is treated and Z = 0 when it
is not). Thus, we denote ATT:

E[Y1i − Y0i]

E[Y1i − Y0i|Zi = 1]

(2)
The ATT is the mean eﬀect of treatment for those schools which actually are only elementary
school. For policy purposes, the ATT is of interest rather than the the ATE (Heckman et al.
(1997)). The problem arises because we can observe only Y1i|Zi = 1 or Y0i|Z = 0. The coun-
terfactual Y0i|Zi = 1 is not observed and E[Y0i|Zi = 1] − E[Y0i|Zi = 0] probably be diﬀerent of

zero in non-experimental studies because the covariates that determine the treatment decision also
determine the outcomes of interest. Therefore, diﬀerences between control and treatment groups
remain even in the absence of treatment which is known as self-selection bias. For our purpose, for
example, richer municipalities may be more likely to maintain diﬀerent schools for diﬀerent school
stages and these kind of municipalities have more resources to invest in education.

In response to that, we must rely on some identifying assumptions to solve this selection
problem. Rosenbaum e Rubin (1983) deﬁned the following assumptions to ensure that a treatment
assignment be strongly ignorable:

U nconf oundness

(Y1i; Y0i) ⊥ Zi|Xi

(3)

Overlap 0 < P r(Zi = 1)|Xi < 1

(4)
The ﬁrst assumption says that in a set of observable covariates X which determine the treatment
assignment, potential outcomes are independent of treatment status. The second condition ensure
that the probability of being both participant and non-participant is bounded away from zero and
one. When both unconfoundness and overlap are hold, then the following also holds:

U nconf oundness given P S (Y1i; Y0i) ⊥ Zi|P(Xi),

(5)
where the propensity score P(Xi) is the probability of treatment given the school characteristics
X.
If the conditions for the strongly ignorable treatment assignment are hold we can use the
Propensity Score Matching (PSM) estimator for the ATT as follows:

AT TP SM = Ep(x)|z=1{E[Y1|Z = 1, P(X)] − E[Y0|Z = 0, P(X)]}

(6)
that is, the PSM estimator is the diﬀerence between the mean outcome for elementary schools and
the mean outcome for elementary-middle schools, weighted by the propensity score distribution.
For this analysis, we use a logit model to estimate the probability of each school to be only primary
school given X.

In the present study we use four diﬀerent school outcomes as dependent variable: 5th grade
students’ average proﬁciency in Portuguese language and mathematics, average passing rate in
elementary school and average dropout rate in elementary school. To select the covariates of
the PSM we follow the procedure proposed by Imbens (2015) that allows, in addition to linear
terms, second-order terms using an interactive process. All the ﬁrst-order variables included in the
estimation are shown in the table (4) that also shows the test of diﬀerence between treated and
control groups4. The variables that represent characteristics of schools were extracted from the
socioeconomic questionnaire of the Prova Brasil while the municipal variable (Per capita GDP)
was taken from IBGE.

To verify the robustness of the results, in addition to the PSM estimation with the data from
2015, we conducted the same estimation with data from 2013 and an alternative methodology

ates from our estimation, the principals average income.

combining PSM with diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence between those years. We also ran tests to check the
quality of matching.

4 Results
In this section, we present the results obtained by the PSM methodology deﬁned in section
(3). Table (8) in the appendix shows the comparative statistics between elementary schools and
elementary-middle schools. The descriptive statistics show that, even without any sorts of controls,
the elementary school has higher outcomes with better student characteristics.

In table (1) we present the PSM estimates. The main methodology used to verify the outcomes
is based on Kernel matching5. Following the approach used in Felício et al. (2012) we also consider
alternatives PSM methodologies to check the results consistency.

Analyzing the four diﬀerent outcomes, we can verify that the diﬀerences between the treatment
and control groups, in our main methodology, are all statistically signiﬁcant at 1%. The ﬁrst column
show that the mean score on Portuguese Language is 4.25 points higher among students enrolled in
elementary schools compared to those who are enrolled in elementary-middle schools. The results
are similar for alternative methodologies (estimates range from 2.96 to 4.58). Higher achievements
among the treated group can also be veriﬁed in mathematics exams. Elementary schools students
had their math average score increased in 5.09 points. Considering the alternative methodologies,
these estimates range from 3.41 to 5.46. As seen, 5th grade primary schools students perform better
in Portuguese language and in mathematics in average than those in elementary-middle school.
The dimension of these diﬀerences are on order of 0.21-0.22 standard deviations.

As can be seen in the column 3, treatment group students have better chances to go to 6th
grade. These results demonstrate that the elementary school had a positive and signiﬁcant impact
on the average passing rate of 5th graders of 2.46 percentage points (estimates range from 1.3 to
2.5). The size of the eﬀect is considerably greater than found in achievements in Portuguese and
mathematics, around 0.35 standard deviations.

The last column of the table (1) presents the ATT of dropout rate comparison (after matching)
between 5th grade students who are enrolled in elementary schools and those who are enrolled in
elementary-middle schools. The PSM estimates indicate that participating in the treated group
reduces the dropout rate in 0.52 percentage points (estimates range from 0.15 to 0.52). The size
of these diﬀerence are on order of 0.25 standard deviations.

Therefore, 5thgrade students enrolled in elementary schools compared (after matching) to those
from elementary-middle schools present better school outcomes.The results maintain the same
direction and signiﬁcance for diﬀerent speciﬁcations of the models.

Mechanisms
This subsection investigates possible variables that could be the channels that explain the best
outcomes for students in the 5st year of elementary schools compared to elementary-middle schools.
For example, the grade span conﬁguration can lead to the generation of alternative pedagogical
practices focused on the speciﬁc needs of students. If this is a mechanism, the principals of these
schools would tend to propose policies aimed at school learning, increase of approval rates and
reduction of dropout. Another channel that can explain at least part of the ﬁndings is school
management. Smaller schools may provide principals with more expertise in conducting school
management.

The ﬁrst group of channels tested were those related to pedagogical practices. They are dummy
variables assuming value 1 when the school oﬀers speciﬁc policies for: achievement reinforcement,
approval enhancement, dropout reduction and extracurricular activities. The second group of
channels, related to school management, is also formed by dummy variables when the school has:
at least 90% of teachers with tenure, teacher training programs, school board meetings at least
quarterly. These variables are present in the SAEB database and are answered by school principals.
These tests are performed using the same PSM regressions presented in table (1),only replacing
the dependent variables (school outcomes) by the dummy variables of the existence of alternative
pedagogical practices. The results of the channel tests are shown in the tables (2) and (3).

7

The results presented in table (2) suggest that elementary schools are more likely to carry
out alternative pedagogical policies. This result is not robust only for achievement reinforcement
policy. Holding the identiﬁcation hypothesis of the PSM, we can say that primary schools are more
likely, by 11 percentage points, to oﬀer approval enhancement policies. Likewise, they are more
likely to oﬀer dropout reduction policies (25 percentage points) and extracurricular activity (5
percentage points). The ﬁndings for these three mechanisms are similar for diﬀerent speciﬁcations.
Regarding the test of the group of channels related to school management, shown in table (3),
the results also indicate that specialized schools tend to have beneﬁts for teachers. There is no
evidence, however, that these schools are more likely to have board meetings more often. The
results indicate that elementary schools are more likely (10 percentage points) to have at least
90% of their teachers with tenure and more likely (5 percentage points) to oﬀer training programs
to their teachers. These ﬁndings suggest that both mechanisms (pedagogical practices and school
management policies for teachers) may be acting to explain the impacts of grade span conﬁguration
in the school outcomes of 5st grade students.

5 Testing
Matching Quality
For the purpose of checking the quality of PSM, we ran tests to verify if the covariates used in
the matching process were properly balanced between treatment and control groups. The tests
ran were complementary, to show how the PSM created groups practically equal to each other.
The ﬁrst test, proposed by Rosenbaum e Rubin (1985),consist of a t test to check the diﬀerences
between the averages of each covariate of treatment and control groups. The results shown in table
(4) are based in Kernel PSM, which was chosen as the main methodology of this paper.

The ﬁrst two columns of table (4) show the mean value of each covariate for treated and control
groups, respectively. The third column, shows the t statistic of the diﬀerences between the groups
after matching. The t-statistic, shown in the third column, shows that all the p-values for this
diﬀerences are higher than 10%, indicating that the matching was adequately balanced, this means
that the diﬀerence of the covariates between the treatment and control groups are not statistically
signiﬁcant at the 10% threshold.

To support the theory that the matching was properly balanced, we also consider Kernel
density functions before and after matching to show the overlap of these distributions. Figure 2
show density functions that overlap almost perfectly after matching, indicating a precise balance
of the PSM.

Sensitivity Analysis of the Results to Unobserved Heterogeneity
Even though many controls are used to assure the quality of the PSM, if both control and treatment
groups diﬀer on unobserved variables that may aﬀect treatment, or outcome, there is a possibility
of the existence of a “hidden bias”. This problem, with non-experimental data, cannot be solved
since there is no way to measure the eﬀect of this bias against the outcome variables. In order to
check the existence of hidden biases, we used the implemented solution suggested by Rosenbaum
(2002) that determines how much an unmeasured variable inﬂuences the treatment assignment or
the outcome.

This issue with non-experimental analysis can also be found in Aakvik (2001), Caliendo et al.
(2005) and Caliendo et al. (2008). This implementation can be overall explained as the partic-
ipation probability of the individual i with the observed characteristics xi. If the equation that
describes this probability includes all the important variables, and there is no hidden bias, we can
conclude that γ will be zero and the participation in the treatment will only be determined by
the explicit covariates. Following Aakvik (2001) and Caliendo et al. (2008), for the signiﬁcance of
eﬀects, we gradually increased the eγ until the inference about the treatment eﬀect changed. With
this we can analyze the strength that unmeasured covariates would require to change the intuition
about the treatment eﬀect.

The results shown in table (5) check if the individuals have the same probability of receiving
treatment, and this happens when eγ = 1 , therefore γ = 0 . If, the critical value for eγ = 2,
individuals who appear to be similar may diﬀer in their probability of receiving the treatment by
a factor of 2. In other words, eγ is a measure of the degree that the propensity is free of hidden
bias. This values doesn’t represent that the model contain unobserved bias, it simply veriﬁes that
in case of the existence of hidden biases, the conﬁdence interval, until the inference was changed,
is contained in this values. The results allow us to conclude that even large amounts of unobserved
heterogeneity would not alter the inference about the ATT shown in the table (1).

Alternative Identiﬁcation Strategies
In order to check the robustness of the ﬁndings, we also ran PSM for the previous year of SAEB,
2013. As seen in table (6), we can conclude that the results can be seen throughout the years and
do not qualify as a singular occurrence.

Another estimation strategy used to check if the results are consistent is the PSM with
diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences between 2013 and 2015. Our treated group are schools that have be-
come elementary schools between 2013 and 2015. The control group are schools that remained
elementary-middle schools between the two periods. Although not so strong the results shown in
table (7) are similar to those found in tables (1) and (6). Note that in this speciﬁcation the sample
size is reduced. This is because the matching is done only with schools that have changed the grade
conﬁguration. Another factor that may explain the reduction of the magnitude of the coeﬃcient is
that the eﬀects may be lower in the short term. Changing pedagogical and management practices
may take some time.

6 Conclusion
The main purpose of this paper was to analyze, given the demographic transition that Brazil is
going through, the alternative courses of action given the excess supply in the Brazilian school
system. As seen in other countries, this demographic change creates an opportunity to reformu-
late the educational system. This could be done by closing schools and relocating students, or
by specializing schools, splitting the elementary-middle school conﬁguration into elementary and
middle schools, in separate sites. This phenomenon was already studied in the United States
(Byrnes e Ruby (2007)). Their comparison was among students that passed through a school
change in their lives, and how it aﬀected the proﬁciency outcomes. Even though their results show
that this school transition aﬀects negatively the performance of students in standardized tests,
their focus was to observe this eﬀect in older students, entering high-school. Our objective was
to analyze if this school division, into elementary and middle school, could positively aﬀect the
performance of 5th-grade students in Brazil. Our analysis is based on a dataset from the Brazilian

14

Ministry of Education, which provide information on both standardized test results of students
and socioeconomic information of students, teachers and principals.

We estimated the eﬀects of grade span conﬁguration on diﬀerent outcomes, using the Propensity
Score Matching strategy. There are four preliminary ﬁndings. First, treated group of school
students presented results on standardized tests of Portuguese 0.21 standard deviations higher
than those achieved by the control group. Second, students from these schools also present higher
achievement in math (0.22 standard deviations). Third, we estimate that the average passing rate
is 2.46 percentage points higher in elementary schools compared to elementary-middle schools.
This result represents a positive impact of 0.35 standard deviations. Fourth, there is evidence
that these schools are also successful in reducing the dropout rate by 0.52 percentage points (0.25
standard deviations). We ﬁnd evidence that suggests that both alternative pedagogical practices
and school management policies for teachers are important mechanisms of the eﬀects of school
specialization on student outcomes.

The results presented in this study are statistically signiﬁcant and robust to diﬀerent method-
ological speciﬁcations. Therefore, we believe there is evidence that a change in grade span con-
ﬁguration that specializes schools can improve the school outcomes of 5th grade students. These
ﬁndings have interesting implications for the implementation of public policies. A reorganization
of the school structure is favorable in an environment of reduction of enrollments and maintenance
of the schools supply.

Finally, this study has the limitation of analyzing only the achievements of 5th grade students.
Other studies may contribute to the literature evaluating possible eﬀects for students who switch
schools with the change in grade span conﬁguration.
