Abstract:  We  investigate  the  competitiveness  of  Brazilian  and  Chinese  exports  to 
MERCOSUR  from  2008  to  2017.  Following  conventional  methods,  we  compute  an  Export 
Similarity  Index  (ESI)  for  Brazilian  and  Chinese  exports  to  MERCOSUR.  This  index  is 
disaggregated  according  to  product  similarities.  Results  show  that  the  similarity  between 
Brazilian  and  Chinese  product  exports  has  increased  over  time.  However,  the  ESI 
disaggregation reveals that the similarities largely occur with vertically differentiated goods, 
where the quality of the goods exported by Brazil are considered superior to those exported by 
China. Thus, competition between Brazil and China in the MERCOSUR has declined over time 
since the two countries export to different market segments.

Resumo: Este artigo investiga a competitividade das exportações brasileiras e chinesas para o 
MERCOSUL para o período de 2008 a 2017. Com a utilização de métodos convencionais, o 
Índice de Similaridade das Exportações  (ISE)  é  calculado entre as exportações brasileiras e 
chinesas para o MERCOSUL. Este índice é desagregado de acordo com as similaridades dos 
produtos. Os resultados mostraram que similaridade entre as exportações brasileiras e chinesas 
vem aumentando com o tempo. No entanto, a desagregação do  ISE revelou que as maiores 
similaridades  vêm  ocorrendo  com  produtos  diferenciados  verticalmente,  ou  seja,  naqueles 
produtos  cuja  qualidade  se  mostra  superior  para  as  exportações  brasileiras  do  que  as 
exportações  chinesas.  Ou  seja,  a  competição  entre  Brasil  e  China  no  MERCOSUL  tem 
declinado  ao  longo  do  tempo,  pois  os  dois  países  exportam  bens  destinados  para  diferentes

MERCOSUR?: A SIMILARITY AND QUALITY ANALISYS REVISITED

1. INTRODUCTION 
  

A  large  portion  of  China’s  economic  growth  can  be  attributed  to  increased 
participation in international markets. The contribution of international trade to China's GDP 
increased from virtually zero in the sixties to approximately 30 percent in 2006 (Rodrik, 2006). 
By  2013  China  became  the  world’s  largest  trading  nation,  outpacing  the  United  States  and 
Germany. The rapid integration of China into world markets has attracted the attention of many 
economists. Rodrik (2006) notes that, despite the important role of the intensive export sectors, 
China has increased its exports of more sophisticated products. Paradoxically, despite low per 
capita  income,  China  has  a  highly  sophisticated  and  diversified  export  structure,  similar  to 
countries with per capita income many times higher.  

The  international  trade  of  China  and  Brazil  is  closely  linked.  Increased  Chinese 
participation in international markets has directly impacted Brazilian foreign trade. Between 
2000 and 2009, total trade (exports plus imports) between Brazil and China increased from $ 
2.3 to $ 56.4 billion, making China the main trading partner of Brazil in 2009 (IPEA, 2011). 
The pattern of trade between the two countries is clearly inter-industry in nature; Brazil exports 
primary  commodities  (iron  ore,  soybeans  and  derivatives,  leather  products,  wood  pulp)  and 
imports  mostly  industrialized  products  (electrical  equipment,  inorganic  chemicals,  optical 
instruments,  photographic  equipment)  (IPEA,  2011).  While  China  constitutes  an  important 
target  market  for  Brazilian  exports,  Chinese  products  compete  with  Brazilian  products  in 
markets with similar export structures. 

Filgueiras and Kume (2010) analyze the degree of similarity of export structures of 
Brazil  and  China  in  North  American  markets.  By  applying  the  Finger  and  Kreinin  (1979)5 
similarity index, the authors found that the similarity of each country’s their exports to North 
American increased from 0.11 to 0.15 between the years 2000 to 2005, but retreated to 0.10 by 
2008. Filgueiras and Kume suggest this decrease could be due to the displacement of Brazilian 
exports by increased Chinese exports. 

Carmo et al. (2014) investigate the trade similarities between Brazilian and Chinese 
exports to MERCOSUR for the period 1995-20096, and they conclude that the similarity of 
exports  for  MERCOSUR  has  increasing  over  time,  however,  most  of  it  based  on  vertically 
differentiated products, which indicates that Chinese exports are not an important threat to the 
Brazilian exports at the time. 

According  to  Fontagné  et  al.  (2007)  trade  competition  between  countries  can  be 
reduced if the products exported are vertically differentiated or have distinct qualities and thus 
targeted  for distinct market segments. To illustrate, these authors examined the competition 
between the European Union (EU) and China in vertically differentiated products during the 
period  1995-2004.  They  grouped  the  products  into  three  categories:  low,  medium  and  high 
quality according to the unit value of the product. They found the EU concentrated its exports 
on  the  high-quality  segment,  while  Chinese  exports  were  concentrated  on  the  low-quality 
segment. They conclude that export competition is lessened when the exported products are 
directed toward different market segments. 
                                                 
5 The Finger and Kreinin index varies in the interval between 0 and 1. See section 3 for more details.  
6 In Carmo et al. (2014), however, it might be possible that the results were mostly influenced by the boom in the 
commodities’ prices in the international markets.

Based on the contributions of Filgueiras and Kume (2010) and Fontagné et al. (2007), 
our  goal  here  is  to  analyze  the  competitiveness  of  exports  from  Brazil  and  China  to 
MERCOSUR7, in an attempt to revisit Carmo et al. (2014) study, but considering a more recent 
period, without a possible influence of the commodities higher prices for the most of 2000s. 
We begin by computing Finger and Kreinin´s index of export similarity. This is followed with 
a disaggregation of the index to assess whether the quality of Brazilian products is superior or 
inferior  to  the  quality  of  Chinese  products.  We  thus  gain  a  more  detailed  and  more 
comprehensive understanding of the nature of competition between the two countries. 

The results of this study suggest that the similarity of exports from Brazil and China 
in MERCOSUR has increased over time, suggesting that competition between countries has 
become stronger. However, through the decomposition of the Finger and Kreinin (1979) index, 
we find that the similarity of exports occurs mostly in vertically differentiated products, where 
the quality of products exported by Brazil are higher than the quality of products exported by 
China. These conclusions seem to confirm and stress most of the results showed in Carmo et 
al. (2014). 

We follow with four sections. In Section 2 we present our theoretical framework. In 
section  3  we  describe  our  empirical  strategy  and  data  sources.  We  present  and  discuss  our 
results in Section 4. And, in section 5 we offer some concluding remarks. 
 
 
2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND: HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL PRODUCTS 
DIFFERENTIATION 
 

Products  can  be  differentiated  in  either  horizontal  or  vertical  form.  Horizontal 
differentiation is due to heterogeneous consumer preferences. Even if the differences among 
products  are  very  subtle  there  is  a  consensus  about  which  product  is  best.  Vertically 
differentiated products have substantial quality differences so that a consensus is reached as to 
which product is preferred (Church and Ware, 2000). 

To better distinguish the concepts of horizontal and vertical differentiation we use an 
example for the automobile industry where new cars are produced by different firms. These 
cars can be described as horizontally differentiated, since they have certain characteristics and 
attributes  that  distinguish  them  from  each  other.  These  differences  are  small  and  specific 
resulting in a consensus among consumers about which car is better. Here we might compare 
the products of different luxury car manufacturers.  

Vertically  differentiated  products  show  substantial  quality  differences,  as  when  we 
compare entry-level to luxury cars. Luxury cars have characteristics and attributes that elevate 
them to a higher level than entry-level cars. Consumers are thus likely to conclude that luxury 
cars are of higher quality than entry-level cars. 

 
 

2.1. MAIN THEORETICAL MODELS 
 

The foundation of the neoclassical theory of international trade is the Heckscher-Ohlin 
(HO  hereafter)  model.  In  this  model  international  trade  is  determined  by  the  comparative 
advantage of countries, which stems from the relative abundance of capital and labor. The main 
result is that capital-abundant countries specialize in the production/export of capital-intensive 
products, while labor-abundant countries specialize in the production/export of labor-intensive 
products.  The  resulting  pattern  depicts  inter-industry  trade  behavior  where  countries  trade 
products from different industries. 
                                                 
7 The choice of MERCOSUR was due to the fact that this market is an important export market for the Brazilian 
manufactured products (Hiratuka and Cunha, 2011). MERCOSUR consists of  Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and 
Uruguay.  

4 
 

The basic assumptions of the HO model began to be questioned in the literature when 
Balassa (1967) and Grubel (1967) found that international trade between countries belonging 
to the newly formed European Economic Community took place in two ways. Although the 
trade list of countries can be similar, a different pattern of trade can emerge that is of intra-
industry in nature. 

While  empirical  evidence  appeared  in  the  sixties,  not  until  the  late  seventies  did 
theoretical models of intra-industry trade emerge, from which we have the seminal work of 
Krugman (1979, 1980, 1981). 

Krugman (1981) starts with a monopolistically competitive structure where economies 
of  scale  are  internal  to  the  firm,  and  consumer  preference  is  of  the  "love  for  variety"  type. 
Krugman shows that exported goods will be similar for all countries, following an intra-industry 
pattern of trade. This model suggests that the specialization of countries no longer occurs at the 
industry level, but at the product level, which is differentiated horizontally (in variety). 

The  theoretical  models  of  Krugman  (1981)  and  Helpman  and  Krugman  (1985) 
accommodate  inter-and  intra-industry  trade  patterns.  Krugman  (1981)  assumes  that  inter-
industry trade is explained by the comparative advantage of countries, as in the HO model, 
while  intra-industry  trade  is  explained  within  a  monopolistically  competitive  structure.  The 
conclusion of the Helpman and Krugman (1985) model is that the list of export products of the 
countries will become more similar the greater the similarity in capital-labor ratios. 

It is important to mention that the models of Krugman (1979, 1980, 1981) and Helpman 
and  Krugman  (1985)  assume  the  productive  specialization  of  countries  might  occur  at  the 
product level, where it is differentiated horizontally i.e., by variety. However, some theoretical 
literature finds the intra-product specialization may occur vertically, when it is differentiated 
by quality as in Falvey (1981), Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987), Flam and Helpman (1987), and 
Grossman and Helpman (1991). 

Falvey (1981) and Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987) demonstrated that vertical product 
differentiation is a direct consequence of the differences in the production functions of trading 
partners. The capital-abundant country will specialize in the production of differentiated high 
quality products, while labor-abundant country will specialize in the production of low quality 
products. Thus, models of Falvey (1981) and Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987) can be viewed as 
a variation of the HO model. Instead of production specialization occuring at the industry level, 
in  Falvey  (1981)  and  Falvey  and  Kierzkowski  (1987)  it  occurs  at  the  level  of  product 
specialization, that is, varieties of a product have different qualities. 

Thus, while the HO model predicts trade of different goods, models based on Falvey 
(1981) and Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987) considers trade in different varieties of goods, but 
with different qualities. According to Greenaway and Milner (1986), "Falvey" type of models 
can be considered neo-Heckscher-Ohlin model of intra-industry trade. These are based on the 
assumptions described in Jones (1974) and Deardorff (1979), in which: (i) all countries have 
access to the same production technology; (ii) the available technology is of constant returns to 
scale;  (iii)  countries,  on  the  supply  side,  differ  only  in  the  relative  factor  endowments;  (iv) 
different varieties of goods have different requirements of production factors, that is, the higher 
the  quality,  the  higher  the  relative  capital  intensity;  and  (v)  factor  prices  are  only  partially 
equalized8. 

Further, the model of Flam and Helpman (1987) considers the differences between the 
qualities of the products are from technological differences between countries. In this case, the 
most  technologically  advanced  countries  will  specialize  in  exporting  the  highest  quality 
products, while the less technologically advanced countries will specialize in products of lower 
quality. 

In the same line of Flam and Helpman (1987), Grossman and Helpman (1991) develop 
a theoretical model of the product cycle, known in the literature as "quality ladder model". In 
                                                 
8 This assumption avoids the problem of trade pattern indeterminacy, which occurs when having more factors 
than final goods if factor prices are equalized (Bhagwati, 1972). 

5 
 

this model, the most technologically advanced countries use their comparative advantage in 
innovation to develop new products of higher quality. After venturing into the market, these 
new products are then copied by follower countries. 

 

2.2. WHAT DOES THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE HAVE TO SAY?  

 
With  the  development  and  improvement  of  international  trade  data  at  more 
disaggregated levels, empirical studies have emerged that examine not only the similarity of 
the exports of the countries but also the intra-product specialization. For example, Hummels 
and Klenow (2005) used a database composed of 126 exporting countries and 59 importing 
countries, with trade flows disaggregated at six-digit Harmonized System. They  find robust 
evidence that countries with higher levels of per capita income export to a larger number of 
products and penetrate their products on a larger number of markets at export prices slightly 
higher than the competition. They assumed that product price reflects the quality. The authors 
conclude  that  international  trade  specialization  exists  at  the  product  level  with  the  most 
developed nations specializing in the production and exporting of the highest quality products, 
while the less developed nations specializing in the production and exporting of lower quality 
products. 

Using  disaggregated  U.S.  import  data  at  the  level  of  10-digit  Harmonized  System, 
Schott (2006) observes that the U.S. imports the same products from different countries, but 
product prices vary systematically according to the level of income of trading partners. In this 
case, the evidence shows that product prices from rich countries are higher than those coming 
from poor countries. Again it is assumed that the higher product price reflects its higher quality. 
Schott argues that firms from capital abundant countries use their productivity advantage to 
specialize  in  the  production  of  higher  quality  products  and  mitigate  competition  with  low 
quality products from labor abundant countries. 

Following this logic, Fontagné et al. (2007) argue that competition between countries 
can be reduced if exports are differentiated in quality. In examining the competition between 
the European Union and China, based on the unit value of the products the authors divide the 
trade flows in low, medium and high quality. In this case, the authors observed that the EU 
exports are concentrated in the high quality segment, while China had a high share of exports 
in  the  low  quality  market  segment9.  The  authors  conclude  that  European  Union-China 
competition is mitigated due to the form of product differentiation. 

Faruq (2010) found the quality of exported products to be directly related to research 
and development activities, supporting the hypothesis of technological leadership models (Flam 
and Helpman, 1987; Grossman and Helpman, 1991). Faruq also finds evidence that the quality 
of products is determined by foreign direct investment, confirming the results of Reganati and 
Pittiglio (2005) and Caetano and Gallego (2007). The foreign firm uses the investment to adopt 
new technology, thus improving product quality. 

Krishna and Maloney (2011) analyzed the imports of the U. S. in the period 1990-2001 
using unit values as proxies for product quality. They found that U.S. imports many of the same 
products from different countries, even though there can be large differences in their unit values 
(which are interpreted as differences in qualities). These imports are positively correlated with 
the level of per capita income of the exporting country. They also argue that there is an intra-
product specialization in international trade, corroborating the results found in Hummels and 
Klenow (2005) and Schott (2006). Moreover, Krishna and Maloney (2011) also identified that 
the growth rate of the quality of products has increased over time, but differ across countries 
where the highest rates are observed for the richer countries belonging to OECD. 

Kang  and  Lee  (2012)  study  the  relative  quality  of  products  traded  between  South 
Korea  and  15  OECD  countries  plus  Taiwan.  For  the  period  1996-2003.  The  authors  used 

                                                 
9 Paillacar and Zignago (2007) also conclude that the Chinese exports are concentrated on low quality products.  

disaggregated bilateral trade flows for high quality and poor quality goods. They observed that 
the quality of exported products from South Korea is inferior to the quality of the products 
exported by the 15 OECD countries. Using panel data econometric methods, the authors found 
that  differences  in  the  availability  of  physical  capital  tends  to  increase  trade  in  vertically 
differentiated  products,  supporting  the  central  hypothesis  of  Falvey  (1981)  and  Falvey  and 
Kierzkowski (1987).

3. METHODOLOGY 
 

The  above  literature  shows  that  export  specialization  occurs  in  intra-product  form, 
which  can  be  either  either  horizontally  or  vertically  differentiated.  When  differentiated 
vertically, competition among countries in the international market is reduced, given products 
are  designed  for  different  market  segments.  Following  this  idea,  this  section  describes  the 
methodology  we  use  to  investigate  the  competition  between  China  and  Brazil  in  the 
MERCOSUR  market.  Following  the  theoretical  models  of  Falvey  (1981)  and  Falvey  and 
Kierzkowski (1987), does competition occur in differentiated products in variety or quality? 

The methods used in this paper are defined two fold. First, using the index of Finger 
and Kreinin (1979), we identify the similarity of products exported by both Brazil and China to 
MERCOSUR. Second, we characterize how product differentiation occurs, whether products 
are differentiated horizontally or vertically. 

 

 
3.1. MEASURING AND DECOMPOSITION OF THE EXPORT SIMILARITY INDEX 
 

The  measurement  of  product  similarity  of  exports  from  Brazil  and  China  in  the 

MERCOSUR is performed through the Finger and Kreinin index: 

 

 

ESI(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7) = (cid:10)min(cid:14)C(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:7);C(cid:16)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:21)

 

[1] 

where, (cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:28) denotes export similarity index of country i (Brazil) and country j (China), in 
the market m (MERCOSUR), at time t; (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:25)(cid:27)(cid:28) is the share of product k, in the list of exports 
from country i (Brazil), in the market m (MERCOSUR), at time t; (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:28) is the share of product 
k, in the list of exports of country j (China), in market m (MERCOSUR), at time t. 
The export similarity index (ESI) varies in the interval between 0 and 1. When the 
exports of country i (Brazil) and country j (China) have the same distribution, the index is equal 
to one. When exports have completely different distributions, the index is equal to zero. An ESI 
index  close  to  unity  can  be  an  indication  that  the  competition  between  China  and  Brazil  in 
MERCOSUR is quite fierce. 

In this paper we propose a way to decompose the index of Finger and Kreinin (1979) 
to identify whether exports from Brazil and China to MERCOSUR occurs in horizontally or 
vertically  differentiated  products.  This  decomposition  will  be  based  on  the  criterion  of 
similarity of products (Crespo and Fontoura, 2004), which is difined as the ratio of unit values 
of product k exported by Brazil (VU(cid:16)(cid:7)! ) and China (VU(cid:16)(cid:7)" ) for MERCOSUR10.  If the ratio of unit 

                                                 
10  The  application  of  the  criterion  of  similarity  of  products  in  the  index  of  Finger  and  Kreinin  (1979)  is  an 
innovation of this paper, since most of the studies in the literature (Abd El-Rahman, 1991;. Greenaway et al, 1994; 
Fontagné and Freudenberg, 1997; Durkin and Krygier, 2000; Nielsen and Lüthje, 2002; Crespo and  Fontoura, 
2004; Jensen and Lüthje, 2009) employ the criterion of similarity of products to obtain the disaggregated index of 
Grubel and Lloyd (1975).

values11 [λ = VU(cid:16)(cid:7)! VU(cid:16)(cid:7)"
] is near the one, the products marketed by the countries do not have 
significant differences and are considered horizontally differentiated. When the ratio of unit 
values deviates too far from one, the products marketed have significant differences and are 
considered vertically differentiated. The criteria used to define if λ is close or far from the unit 
is the dispersion interval: [(1-α); (1 + α)]. Thus, when λ lies within this range the products are 
horizontally differentiated; otherwise, they are vertically differentiated.  

When applying the criterion of product similarity, the the parameter α is very important 
because it sets the way the products are marketed by different countries. Following Greenaway 
et  al.  (1994),  Durkin  and  Krygier  (2000),  Nielsen  and  Lüthje  (2002),  Crespo  and  Fontoura 
(2004) and Jensen and Lüthje (2009), we use a dispersion factor (α) equal to 25 percent12. Thus, 
the range for identifying the horizontal product differentiation is defined by: [0.75; 1.25]. If the 
ratio  of  the  unit  values  (λ)  lies  outside  this  range  the  products  are  considered  vertically 
differentiated. 

The  similarity  criterion  further  allows  us  to  identify  if  the  quality  of  the  products 
exported by Brazil are superior or inferior to the quality of products exported by China. In this 
case, from Brazil’s perspective, the product quality is considered inferior or superior when λ < 
(1-α) or λ > (1 + α), respectively. Figure 1 illustrates the differentiation of products according 
to similarity.

It is also important to note that the similarity criterion assumes that the unit value of 
the product is a proxy for quality. According to Greenaway et al. (1994), the rationale for the 
use of unit value as a proxy for quality derives from the assumption that consumers have perfect 
information and are able to distinguish product quality. The good will have a higher quality 
when the unit value is larger than the good of poorer quality. Stiglitz (1987) sbmits the unit 

                                                 
11 According to the standard literature (Greenaway et al., 1994; Fontagné and Freudenberg, 1997; Schott, 2004; 
Crespo and Fountoura, 2004; Fontagné et al., 2007; Jensen and Lüthje, 2009; Hiratuka and Cunha, 2011) the unit 
value is calculated by the ratio between the trade value (V) and the trade quantity (Q), that is: VU = V/Q. 
12 Abd-el-Rahman (1991), Fontagné et al. (1997), and Jensen and Lüthje (2009) use a dispersion factor (α) equal 
to 15%. According to Greenaway et al. (1995), the adoption of a dispersion factor equal to 15 percent will result 
in a range of dispersion equal to 30 percent, which may be considered too narrow, if imperfect information prevails 
in the market. Thus, the authors advocate the use of a dispersion factor of 25 percent, which provides a range of 
dispersion equal to 50 percent; with such interval it is expected to cover information gaps that are due to the size 
and diversity of the country (Zhang et al. 2005). Greenaway et al. (1995), Durkin and Krygier (2000), Crespo and 
Fontoura (2004), and Jensen and Lüthje (2009) found no statistically significant differences between factors of 
dispersion of 15 and 25 percent. However, despite all the care in choosing the dispersion factor, its definition still 
has an arbitrary nature. For a more detailed discussion of this topic, see Davis and Weinstein (2001).

value (price) will have a positive relationship with product quality even when consumers do not 
have perfect information13. 

Most  product  quality  studies  in  the  international  trade  literature  are  based  on  the 
assumption  that,  at  high  level  of  disaggregation,  relative  prices  reflect  relative  quality. 
Greenaway et al. (1994). Fontagné et al. (1997) recognize that the direct association between 
the unit price and the quality has limitations, because other factors, such as, market structures, 
cost differences, differences in technology may affect the unit value of the product and, thus, 
lead  to  an  erroneous  interpretation  of  quality.  Fontagné  et  al.  (2007)  also  point  out  that  the 
adoption of the unit value as a proxy for quality uses the restrictive hypothesis that productivity 
is  homogeneous  across  countries,  following  the  assumptions  described  in  Jones  (1974)  and 
Deardorff (1979). Despite these limitations, Fontagné et al. (2007) argue that at the empirical 
point  of  view,  the  quality  that  distinguishes  exported  products  are  present  in  unit  values, 
supporting the plausibility that the unit value of the product is a reasonable proxy for quality. 

After  applying  the  criterion  of  product  similarity,  the  export  similarity  index  (ESI) 

described in equation [1] can be decomposed: 

 

or: 

ESI(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7) = ESI(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)$ + ESI(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)&  

ESI(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7) = ESI(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)$ + ESI(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)&’((cid:19)) + ESI(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)

&’*+,

Thus, the export similarity index (ESI) between countries i (Brazil) and j (China), in 
the  market  m  (MERCOSUR),  at  time  t,  is  the  sum  of  the  similarity  index  of  exports  in 
horizontally  differentiated  products  ((cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:28)- )  and  similarity  index  of  exports  in  vertically 
differentiated products ((cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:28).

3.2. DATASET 

 

 
The index of Finger and Kreinin (1979) of equation (1) is sensitive to the level of trade 
data disaggregation. The index tends to be higher the higher the level of aggregation. Therefore, 
to enable us to achieve our objectives, we use trade data disaggregated at six-digit level of the 
Harmonized System, which includes more than 5,000 products. These data come from the Base 
pour l'Analyse du Commerce International (BACI), which is published by the Centre d'Etudes 
Prospectives  et  d'Informations  Internationales  (CEPII)  and  is  available  for  download  at: 
http://www.cepii. fr / anglaisgraph / bdd / baci.htm. These data cover the period 2008 to 2017. 
The use of the database BACI has an advantage over other databases of international 
trade, such as COMTRADE. While most databases report exports on FOB value (free on board) 
and  imports  on  CIF  value  (Cost,  Insurance  and  Freight),  in  BACI,  the  monetary  values  of 
exports and imports are supported on a FOB-FOB base, considering CIF costs were estimated 
and  removed  from  the  values  of  imports.  For  details  of  the  BACI  dataset,  see  Gaulier  and 
Zignago (2010). 

It  is  important  to  recognize  that  the  use  of  trade  data  at  the  six-digit  level,  while 
extremely disaggregated, has at least one potential problem. Baldwin (2006) refers to the fact 
that these data do not measure the total number of products exported by individual countries, 
given that a large number of products must be comprehended under the same category of the 
Harmonized System. Thus, it is possible that the values we obtain will overestimate the true 
degree  of  export  similarity  Brazil  and  China  to  MERCOSUR.  Despite  this  limitation,  we 
believe that the data used here can provide a good picture of the trade competitiveness of Brazil 
and China in MERCOSUR. 

 
 

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
4.1. BRAZILIAN AND CHINESE EXPORTS TO MERCOSUR FROM 2009 TO 2017 
 

Before analyzing export competitiveness, we present an overview Brazil and China 
exports to MERCOSUR during the period 2008-2017.  Throughout the period Brazil’s exports 
are higher than those of China, but their difference is getting smaller over time (see Figure 2). 
For  instance,  in  2008,  China's  exports  to  MERCOSUR  was  only  31.5  percent  of  Brazilian 
exports to that market, but in 2017 this figure exceeded 56.5 percent, reflecting the rising share 
of Chinese products in MERCOSUR14.  

 

 
 

 

                                                 
14 A fact which contributed to greater integration of China in MERCOSUR was the entry of China into the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.

The sectoral composition of exports from Brazil and China in MERCOSUR is shown 
in Table 2, noting that the numbers are average percentages for the sub-periods of 2008/2010 
and 2015/2017. For Brazil in both periods 2008/2010 and 2015/2017, exports were concentrated 
in  the  sectors:  Transportation,  Machines/Electrical,  Mineral  products  and  Chemicals,  which 
together  accounted  for  around  69.6  percent  and  69.2  percent  of  Brazilian  exports  to 
MERCOSUR in the two periods, respectively. Brazil's exports to MERCOSUR have become 
more concentrated over time, largely driven by the transportation sector. Similarly, in the first 
sub-period China's exports to MERCOSUR were concentrated in Machinery/Electric, Textiles, 
Transoirtation  and  Chemicals,  which  collectively  represent  around  75  percent  of  exports. 
However, by the latter sub-period China’s exports were focused on the same sectors and, to a 
lesser  extent  Miscellaneous  Products,  accounting  for  82.7  percent  of  China's  exports  to 
MERCOSUR. Like Brazil, there was also an increase in the concentration of China's exports in 
MERCOSUR  over  time.  However,  in  China’s  case  this  increase  was  largely  driven  by  the 
transportation and miscellaneous products sectors.

The number of products exported by Brazil and China to MERCOSUR (at six-digit 
Harmonized  System)  is  reported  in  Table  3.  The  number  of  products  exported  by  Brazil  to 
MERCOUSR dropped from 3,454 in 2008 to 3,417 in 2014. After 2015, a slight recovery in 
the total number of products exported by Brazil, reaching 3,541 in 2017. 

In  China's  case,  the  total  number  of  products  exported  to  MERCOSUR showed  an 
increasing trend, from 2,901 products in 2008 to 3,121 products in 2011. After a slight decrease 
in 2012-13, the total number of products exported reached 3,266 in 2017. While China added 
365 products to its MERCOSUR export list, from 2008 to 2017, Brazil saw an increase of only 
87 products over the same period. 

In Table 3 we also show that the products simultaneously exported (same products) by 
both countries increased from 2,469 in 2008 to 2,754 in 2017. After a slight decrease in 2009 
and 2012, the number of products simultaneously exported increased after 2013. It is interesting 
to note that in 2017, 77.8 percent of products exported by Brazil were also exported by China, 
up from 71 percent in 2008. This suggests increasing product competition in MERCOSUR.

In Table 4 we present the average number of products exported to MERCOSUR by 
Brazil, China, and simultaneously by sector, for the periods 2008-2010 and 2015-2017. Both 
countries are focusing their exports on the Machinery/Electric, Metals, Textiles and Chemicals 
sectors. An interesting observation is that, between periods of 2008-2010 and 2015-2017, China 
increased the number of products exported in all sectors, except for the footwear sector, while 
Brazil showed small increases in some sectors, mainly for Transportation, Mineral Products 
and Textiles. 

For  the  Machinery/Electric,  Miscellaneous  products,  Textiles,  Footwear  and 
Stone/Glass  sectors,  the  number  of  products  exported  by  China  exceeded  the  number  of 
products exported by Brazil in 2015-2017. As increasing Chinese penetration in MERCOSUR 
occurred in virtually every sector, the products simultaneously exported by Brazil and China 
for MERCOSUR also increased.

Between 2008-2017 China increased its exports to MERCOSUR and this increase has 
been  accompanied  by  a  rise  in  the  total  number  of  products  sold.  With  the  increase  of  the 
number of products simultaneously exported, the export basket of China in MERCOSUR has 
become increasingly similar to Brazil. A closer analysis of the extent of the similarity of exports 
from Brazil and China in MERCOSUR will be performed in the next section by computing the 
ISE index. 

 
 

4.2. EXPORT SIMILARITY INDEX (ESI) 

 
We now further quantify the similarities of products exported from Brazil and China 
in  MERCOSUR.  This  is  done  in  two  steps.  In  the  first  step  we  compute  product  similarity 
indices at the aggregate level, all trade between Brazil and China with MERCOSUR. In the 
second, we compute disaggregated indices by sector. 

 
 

4.2.1. Agregate analysis 

 
The evolution of the export similarity index (ESI) of Brazil and China in MERCOSUR 
over the period 2008-2017 is shown in Figure 3. It is unmistakable that exports from Brazil and 
China have become increasingly similar over time, as the ESI index is increasing. From the 
initial year (2008) to the final year (2017), the index increased from 0.19 to 0.20, or 7.8 percent.

The evidence found here is different from that found by Filgueiras and Kume (2010) 
in the North American market. These authors found the similarity of exports between Brazil 
and China in the North American market first increased from 0.11 to 0.15, between the years 
2000 to 2005, then decreased to 0.1015 in 2008, virtually no change over the entire period. In 
Figure 3 we can see a slight increasing trend. This could well indicate that the competition 
between China and Brazil in MERCOSUR has become stronger over time, but at lower pace 
than showed in previous studies, such as Carmo et al. (2014). 

We argued earlier that the competition between Brazil and China can be smoothed if 
the traded products are  vertically differentiated.  This may be the situation here  as the same 
products may be sold in different market segments, according to Fontagné et al. (2007). Thus 
we decompose the ESI into horizontal and vertical differentiated components, ESIH and ESIV.

15 The data used by Filgueiras and Kume (2010) to calculate the similarity of exports from Brazil and China in the 
North American market were more disaggregated from those used in this study. While these authors used data 
disaggregated at 10-digit level, in the present study the data are disaggregated to six-digit level. Thus, as noted in 
subsection 3.2, more disaggregated data tend to provide lower values of the ISE index than more aggregated data.

In  Table  5  export  similarity  occurs  mainly  in  vertically  differentiated  products 
(products with different qualities), as the ESIV represents more than 70 percent of the ESI over 
the  entire  2008-2017  period.  Thus,  product  competition  between  Brazilian  and  Chinese 
products in MERCOSUR has been attenuated, since the products simultaneously exported are 
directed toward different market segments. 

Whereas vertically differentiated products possess different qualities, in Table 6 we 
compute indices to see if the quality of products exported by Brazil are superior or inferior to 
those exported by China.

In Table 6, it is apparent that when products simultaneously exported by Brazil and 
China possess different qualities, the quality of Brazilian products is larger than the quality of 
Chinese products. These data are consistent with the results observed in Filgueiras and Kume 
(2010) in the North American market, and Carmo et al (2014) for Brazilian and Chinese exports 
to MERCOSUR, where these studies also found the quality of products exported by Brazil to 
be higher than the quality of products exported by China. 

According to the neo-Hecksher-Ohlin (Falvey, 1981; Falvey and Kierzowski, 1987), 
the quality of exported products is directly linked to the capital-labor ratio of the countries. The 
country with the larger capital-labor ratio will export a higher quality product to the country 
with a lower capital/labor ratio. Therefore, the relatively higher quality of Brazilian exports is 
attributed to the relatively higher capital-labor ratio of Brazil16. These results are in consonance 
with  other  studies  which  also  found  the  existence  of  a  intra-product  trade  specialization 
(Hummels and Klenow, 2005; Shott, 2006). 

In sum, we find that the similarity of exports from Brazil and China in MERCOSUR 
has  increased  over  time,  suggesting  that  competition  between  countries  in  that  market  is 
increasingly getting stronger. However, this competition has softened a bit since a high portion 
of  the  exported  products  are  vertically  differentiated.  We  further  observe  product  quality 
differences; the quality  of Brazilian products exported to MERCOSUR is higher than those 
from China. 

 

                                                 
16 Based on World Bank data,  Filgueira and Kume (2010) report that in 2008 per capita income in Brazil was US$ 
10,070 while in China it was US$ 6,020. The rationale for the use of per capita income as a proxy for capital/labor 
ratio is the following: consider that Y = F (K, L), where Y denotes GDP, K is the amount of physical capital, (.) L 
denotes the number of  workers and F is a smooth function of degree one. Thus, by dividing both sides by the 
function L, we get: y = f (k); where y = Y/L and k = K/L. 

4.2.2. Sectoral analysis 
 

Now we turn to the similarity of exports from Brazil and China to MERCOSUR by 
specific sector. In order to avoid a large dispersion of information, data in Table 7 are reported 
as average values for the following subperiods: 2008-2010, 2011-2014, and 2015-2017.

In Table 7, we see how export similarity between Brazil and China has changed over 
time. The highest similarity occurs in the Footwear industry, reaching a magnitude of 0.65 for 
the  period  2011-2014  and  2015-201717.  Ranking  second  in  2008-2010,  the  Plastic/Rubber 
industry saw a continuous rise in the ESI reaching 0.44. Other sectors that showed continuous 
increase in similarity over time were Food products and Timber. All sectors in Table 7 show 
increases over time, with the exception of Stone/Glass sector. The lowest ESI are for those 
sectors producing primary  goods  (Animal and  animal products and vegetable products) and 
sectors that are intensive in natural resources (Mineral products). This is plausible since the list 
of exports from Brazil and China in MERCOSUR focus mostly on manufactured products, as 
seen earlier in Table 2. 

We now desaggregate the ESI in ESIH and ESIV for each of the fifteen sectors. These 
results are reported in Table 8 as the mean percentages for the sub-periods: 2008-2010, 2011-
2014 and 2015-2017. For the majority of sectors, the ESI occurs in vertically differentiated 
products, given that the ESIV is larger than the ESIH. However, the ESIH increases in the last 
sub-period  for  Timber  sector.  This  may  suggest  that  the  quality  of  Brazilian  and  Chinese 
products in this sector have recently become more similar. In the case of Animal and animal 
products,  however,  the  similarity  changed  over  time  from  vertically  to  horizontally 
differentiated products.  

 
 
 
 

                                                 
17 Probably most of these changes were due to Brazilian exchange rate policy in each period.

In Table 9 we see if the quality of the Brazilian exports is superior or inferior to the 
quality of the Chinese exports when they are vertically differentiated. Because ESIV-Sup. is larger 
than the ESIV-Inf. the quality of products exported by Brazil is superior to the quality of Chinese 
products in most industries. However, in some sectors the ESIV-Inf. is larger than ESIV-Sup.  such 
as  Animals,  Food,  and  Mineral  products.  Specifically  in  the  case  of  Animals  and  Mineral 
products,  there  has  been  a  change  in  the  pattern  of  product  differentiation  between  the 
subperiods. Although the export similarity index (ESI) in these sectors are very low (as in Table 
7), product quality can be strongly influenced by the behavior of a single product, making the 
quality measurement less stable.

In the sectoral analysis, it was possible to verify that most of the results has the same 
trend as showed by Carmo et al. (2014) for the period 1995-2009. Therefore, even after the 
period  of  the  boom  in  the  commodities’  prices,  there  were  some  changes  in  the  sectors’ 
competitiveness in the Brazilian and Chinese exports to MERCOSUR, which might be a sign 
of other factors than export prices.   
 
5. FINAL COMMENTS 

 

The rapid growth in China’s participation in international product markets over the 
past couple decades has impacted exporters competing in similar markets. In particular, exports 
from  China  to  MERCOUSR  may  threaten  Brazilian  exports,  especially  when  the  exported 
products are similar. However, Fontagné et al. (2007) finds that competition between countries 
can be mitigated if the exported products are vertically differentiated. 

In this paper we investigate the competitiveness of exports from Brazil and China in 
MERCOSUR over the period 2008 to 2017. We measure the similarity of their exports to using 
the index (ESI) proposed by Finger and Kreinin (1979). The further decomposition of the index 
enables us to identify product quality. Thus we are able to find out if the quality of Brazilian 
exports is superior or inferior to the quality of Chinese exports to MERCOSUR. 

Using disaggregated trade data at the six-digit level of the Harmonized System, our 
results  suggest  that  the  similarity  of  exports  from  Brazil  and  China  in  MERCOSUR  has 
increased  over  time,  ESI  moving  from  0.19  (in  2008)  to  0.20  (in  2017).  Thus,  export 
competition between the two countries has become stronger. 

Through ESI decomposition, we found that the similarity of exports occurs mostly in 
vertically differentiated products, where the quality of the products exported by Brazil is greater 
than  the  quality  of  the  products  exported  by  China.  Our  findings  are  consistent  with  trade 
models of the "Falvey" type, which show countries with a higher relative abundance of capital 
will produce goods of superior quality to those produced by countries with a higher relative 
abundance of labor.  

Despite  increasing  exports  by  both  Brazil  and  China  to  MERCOSUR,  Brazil  has 
increased its relative share of high value added (quality) export products. As Brazil seeks to add 
value  to  its  MERCOSUR  exports,  the  China’s  increased  presence  may  not  be  in  direct 
competiton with Brazil.
