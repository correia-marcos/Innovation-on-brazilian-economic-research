Abstract 
 
We  empirically  analyze  strike  duration  in  Brazil,  with  emphasis  on  legislation  changes  induced  by  the 
new Federal Constitution of 1988. Our empirical background comes from a very rich micro dataset built 
by  Noronha et  al.  (1998).  By  means of  a sequence  of estimation  and  testing  procedures  based on  both 
proportional  and  non-proportional  hazards  model,  and  controlling  for  effects  associated  with  economic 
indicators as well as geographic dummies, we are able to find significant differences on strike duration 
induced by the new Brazilian Constitution. Results suggest that the Constitution changed the pattern of 
strike  duration,  increasing  its  length  and  changing  its  etiology.  Also,  we  evidenced  qualitatively 
differences  between  periods  of  analysis  as  well,  since  the  proportional  hazards  specification  was 
thoroughly  rejected  for  post-constitutional  strikes.  The  reduction  of  hazard  rate  in  the  post-constitution 
period  we  found  can  be  tentatively  rationalized  as  a  logical  effect  of  increased  organizational  level, 
greater bargaining power of unions and clearer rules of legal procedures brought by the new Constitution. 
Finally, there is evidence that strikes initiated in São Paulo conforms better to orthodox models of strike 
dynamics vis-a-vis the rest of the country.

Analisamos  empiricamente  a  duração  de  greves  no  Brasil,  com  ênfase  nas  mudanças  na  legislação 
induzidas  pela  nova  Constituição  Federal  de  1988.  Nosso  arcabouço  empírico  advém  de  uma  base  de 
dados muito rica construída por Noronha et al. (1998). Por meio de uma seqüência de procedimentos de 
estimação e testes baseados tanto no modelo de risco proporcional quanto no modelo não-proporcional, 
controlando  os  efeitos  associados  através  de  indicadores  econômicos,  bem  como  dummies  geográficas, 
fomos  capazes  de  encontrar  diferenças  significativas  na  duração  das  greves,  induzidas  pela  nova 
Constituição brasileira. Os resultados sugerem que a Constituição mudou o padrão de duração das greves, 
aumentando a sua duração e mudando a sua etiologia. Além disso, evidenciamos diferenças qualitativas 
entre  os  períodos  de  análise,  uma  vez  que  a  especificação  de  riscos  proporcionais  foi  completamente 
rejeitada para greves ocorridas no período pós-constitucional. A redução da taxa de risco no período pós-
Constituição que encontramos pode ser provisoriamente racionalizada como um efeito lógico de aumento 
do nível de organização, maior poder de barganha dos sindicatos e regras mais claras de procedimentos 
legais trazidas pela nova Constituição. Finalmente, há evidências de que as greves iniciadas em São Paulo 
conformam melhor com os modelos ortodoxos de dinâmica de greve vis-à-vis o resto do país.

Introduction 

Strikes  are  defined  as  work  stoppages  caused  by  the  mass  refusal  of  employees  to  work, 

usually used to pressure governments and/or employers to change policies or to achieve better working 

conditions. It is characterized as a final form of negotiation between employers and employees, after not 

reaching  a  common  agreement  in  previous  negotiations.  However,  there  is  not  a  consensus  in  the 

economics literature about the determinants of occurrence and duration of strikes. The main problem is 

the lack of a unified theory that accomplishes a fully explanation of when a strike will begin, how long it 

should  last  and  its  main  determinants  ,  as  well  as  the  negotiated  requirements  and  their  potential 

outcomes, trying to avoid or at least to minimize their costs [Kennan (1987)]. 

Two  segments  in  the  literature,  explaining  the  reasons  for  the  occurrence  of  strikes  and 

subsequently of their durations, are identified by Perez et al. (2006). The first strand originated in Hicks 

(1932)  Theory  of  Wages  and  suggests  that  strikes  are  mistakes  or  accidents  that  occur  during 

negotiations.  Strikes are then  the consequence  of faulty  negotiations.  Unions  would  be  more  willing  to 

accept lower wages in higher periods of strikes, while the firms are more willing to accept the payment of 

higher wages proportion to the duration of the strike – both resulting in larger costs. The duration of the 

strike and the result of negotiations will depend on the equilibrium between the costs of inactivity for both 

parties and the relation between changes in unions’ demands and strike duration is negative. The second 

strand  of  literature  considers  that  the  occurrence  and  duration  of  strikes  are  related  to  the  existence  of 

asymmetric and private information. Considering that each part involved forms its expectations about the 

result  of  negotiations  based  on  their  own  information,  the  assumptions  imply  that  the  strikes  are  more 

frequent and have longer duration the larger the differences between the proposals. 

Brazil  is  a country  with  many  legal  restrictions  in  the  labor  market,  considered  excessively 

regulated.  These  restrictions  reduce  the  flexibility  of  companies  to  turnover,  and  consequently  the 

production  efficiency  [Zylberstajn  (2006)  and  Tafner  (2006)].  The  CLT  (Consolidação  das  Leis  do 

Trabalho – Consolidation of Labor Laws) and the Federal Constitution are the most important labor laws 

in the country. The reformulation of the Constitution in 1988 altered the labor relationship significantly, 

bringing  about  many  changes  on  Brazilian  labor  markets  such  as:  (a)  more  meticulous  and  inflexible 

statement about work conditions, increasing the importance of collective bargaining; (b) more expressive 

role for unions, reducing restrictions on the bases of the category and (c) development of specific labor 

laws,  establishing  the  role  of  unions  on  individual  and  collective  bargaining.  Also,  the  Constitution  of 

1988  expanded  workers'  rights,  including  a  very  detailed  specification  of  the  responsibilities  of  union 

actions and collective agreements.  

Clearly,  the  new  Constitution  had  a  significant  role  in  changing  the  dynamics  of  strikes.  If 

previously there were legal restrictions on strikes and the claims of right were not legitimized by the state, 

 

2/20 

 
the  proclamation  of  the  Constitution  reaffirmed  the  strikers'  rights  and  the  leaders  of  strikes  were 

consolidated  as  negotiators  validated  by  the  government  [NORONHA  et  al.  (1998)].  In  this  context 

Brazilian strikes experienced important changes, not only due to greater power of representation of unions 

that increases their bargaining power, but also due to the definition of clearer and more specific rules of 

negotiation between the parts involved.  

 Although  some  authors  like  CAMARGO  and  AMADEO  (1990)  and  DE  BARROS  and  

CORSEUIL  (2004)  assessed  the  impact  of  changes  induced  by  the  new  Constitution  on  labor  market 

performance they either touched tangentially the issue of strike dynamics or not discuss it at all. Others 

like Picchetti (2002), although devoted an entire analysis to a discussion of empirical estimation models 

of strike duration as well as strike occurrence, completely forget to make any appraisal about the specific 

role  played  by  constitutional  changes.  Hence,  it  appears  to  have  a  scientific  knowledge  gap  about  the 

impact of the new Brazilian constitution on strike dynamics, especially those based on sound empirical 

methodology that employs microeconometrics. 

In fact, econometric studies about duration of strikes are scarce, compared to empirical studies 

about occurrence of strikes. In general, one of the largest problems in recent empirical attempts is data set 

limitation:  even  in  large  samples  of  contract  negotiations  there  are  few  cases  that  are  not  resolved  by 

consensus,  resulting  in  strikes.  Also,  even  in  registered  strikes,  there  is  a  lack  of  information  about  its 

duration and general characteristics [Card (1990)]. 

Based on these remarks, and enjoying the fact that the enactment of a new Constitution is a 

rare event, this paper aims to verify the characteristics of strikes in Brazil over the period from 1983 to 

1991, with emphasis on the impact of institutional changes brought by the Federal Constitution in 1988. 

We analyze the characteristics and determinants of Brazilian strikes using duration analysis. Given the not 

so  frequent  process  of  constitutional  change  observed  in  both  developed  and  developing  economies  as 
well  as  the  quality  of  our  available  micro  data  set2,  we  believe  to  be  in  a  unique  position  to  assess 

economic changes due to a new, and rare, constitutional law enactment.  

We advance to the reader that we refrain from calling the Brazilian 1988 new constitutional 

law a “natural experiment”, at least in this paper. This by no way means that we made a strong claim that 

it is not a “natural experiment”, but our position is grounded on pragmatic reasons: we are not interested 

in  establishing  causality.  In  fact,  we  believe  that  another  paper  could  explore  the  informational  shock 

brought  by  the  new  constitution  and  model  it  as  a  “natural  experiment”,  but  this  belongs  to  another 

scientific endeavor. 

                                                 
2 In fact, our  database consist of information about urban stoppages in Brazil ranging the period 1983-1991, obtained from the 

Consortium of Social Information (CIS – Consórcio de Informações Sociais), presented by Noronha et al. (1998). It is a unique 

micro data set containing all strikes that occurred on that period.

After  a  series  of  detailed  parametric  and  non-parametric  analysis,  overall,  we  are  able  to  find 

marked  differences  in  the  characteristics  of  strikes  before  and  after  the  constitutional  law.  Besides  the 

distinction  between  the  non-parametric  survival  curves  in  two  periods,  our  results  indicate  that  the 

number  of  strikes  is  positively  related  with  the  duration  of  stoppages,  consistent  with  that  found  by 

Harrison  and  Stewart  (1993)  for  Canadian  strikes  for  wage  claims  up  to  500  strikers,  but  different  to 

verified in Spanish strikes by Perez et al. (2006) and Canadian strikes by Cramton et al. (1999).  More 

important, there is a statistically significant reduction on the hazard rate in the post-constitution period. 

Although we should refrain from issues of causality,  our results indicate that it might be the effect of the 

increased  organizational  level  and  the  bargaining  power  of  unions  ex-post  the  constitutional  change, 

which implies a reduction of the impact of changes in unemployment on the wage differential proposed in 

the negotiations, increasing the duration of stoppages. 

Also,  we  found  that  the  inflation  rate  is  positively  related  to  strikes  duration  only  in  the  pre-

constitutional period. The unemployment rate presents an inverse relationship with the strikes duration in 

both  periods,  however,  with  different magnitudes.  The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  structured  as  follows. 

Section 2 examines the econometric literature on the determinants of strikes duration. Section 3 presents 

the database describing Brazilian strikes initiated between 1983 and 1991. The methodology used in this 

study  is  presented  in  section  4,  including  the  selected  variables  and  its  treatment,  according  to  the 

characteristics of the database and the econometric model used in this study, model’s estimation as well 

as  comments.  Section  5  draw  main  conclusions,  including  possible  extensions  of  this  research  and  the 

contribution to the relative economic literature, and develops final considerations.

A Brief Review of the Literature on the Econometrics of Strikes 

 

The international literature usually attempts to relate the occurrence and duration of strikes to 

specific characteristics of firms and macroeconomic factors. Perez et al. (2006) analyze the determinants 

of  strikes  duration  in  Spain,  verifying  the  conditions  of  the  different  final  results  (agreement  or  no 

agreement).  Evidence  shows  that  the  number  of  strikers  is  inversely  related  to  their  duration,  since  the 

strikes are relatively more effective in reducing the firms' profits due to greater inefficiency in production 

or by higher operating costs over the period. Harrison and Stewart (1993) examine the number of strikers 

as  a  determinant  for  strike  duration.  According  to  the  authors, most  of the  empirical  studies  have  been 

accomplished starting from data for strikes involving a great number of workers. A more complete study 

should examine the systematic differences between large and small strikes, therefore observing whether 

large  strikes  are  representative  for  the  general  case.  These  authors  remark  that  the  number  of  strikers 

directly  affects  the  duration  of  strikes,  with  significant  differences  in  their  final  results  when  classified 

 

4/20 

 
according to size, concluding that studies based on work stoppages involving large numbers of workers 

present results that are not representative for all strikes. 

The  inflation  rate  has  an  important  role  in  strikes  duration,  mainly  the  ones  originated  by 

wage  claims.  An  increase  in  expected  inflation  implies  a  higher  nominal  wage  demand.  Since 

negotiations include compensation of monetary values (replacement or readjustment in general) models 

usually use a proxy for expected inflation as an independent variable, represented by the index of inflation 

in  the  previous  period. Since  both  the  occurrence  and  the  duration  of  strikes are  directly  related  to  the 

difference  between  the  wages  offered  and  demanded  in  the  negotiations,  we  have  an  expected  positive 

effect of inflation from the previous period on the duration of stoppages. 

Recent  studies  have  shown  that  the  duration  of  strikes  is  counter-cyclical  –  especially  in 

periods of economic expansion, associated with shorter stoppages – and the unemployment rate is one of 

the most used variables to capture the effects of cycles. However, CRAMTON et al. (1999) states that the 

impact of unemployment is ambiguous, because when the job market is in expansion (presenting a low 

rate of unemployment) there is an increase of both operational costs in replacement of the workforce for 

the companies and the productive inefficiency – what decrease the expected duration of the strikes. But 

the  lower  labor  supply  reduces  the  bargaining  power  of  strikers,  increasing  the  wage  demands  and  the 

duration of strikes. Therefore, the impact of unemployment on the duration of strikes depends on which 

effect is predominant in the economy. 

NORONHA  et  al.  (1998)  conducted  a  study  about  the  evolution  of  strikes  in  Brazil, 

identifying  some  key  characteristics  observed  from  the  end  of  decade  of  70  and  until  the  beginning  of 
decade of 90. According to the authors, the phenomenon of Brazilian strikes began around 1978 in ABC3, 

considered the main industrial area of the country, identifying three major cycles of strikes: first cycle had 

an upward trajectory, ranging from 1978 to 1984, where the organization of unions began in São Paulo 

and spread to other regions in the country; the second cycle occurred between 1985 and 1989 and presents 

a  flat  evolution  path;  finally,  the  third  cycle  was  characterized  by  the  decline  of  stoppages  in  1990, 

reached the end two years later.  

The  cyclical  behavior  denotes  that  the  variation  of  the  number  of  strikes  is  not  caused  by 

substantial variations in the main economic indicators such as employment, income, inflation or periods 

of  election.  From  an  initial  occurrence  of  strikes  on  ABC  –  especially  in  the  automobile  companies  – 

there  was  an  increase  in  the  number  of  work  stoppages  across  the  country,  demonstrating  a  potential 

number  of  conflicts,  previously  covered  by  military  governments.  Although  no  significant  changes 

occurred in the structure of unions, the Federal Constitution of 1988 represented a substantial change on 

the relationship among government, unions and businesses.

Campos and São Caetano – that concentrate the main industrial centers in the country.

Analyzing the duration of strikes in the Brazilian industrial sector, PICCHETTI (2002) notes 

that regardless of the cause of stoppages, strikes that resulted in gains for workers tend to have shorter 

durations, and that longer strikes usually are associated with wage demands with no gains for workers. 

Also, non-wage strikes tend to be longer. Using the Cox proportional hazard model, PICCHETTI (2002) 

finds  that  higher  rates  of  unemployment  are  associated  with  longer  strikes,  and  the  duration  is  an 

increasing  function  of  unemployment.  His  paper  is  the  closest  to  ours.  However,  while  PICCHETTI 

(2002) focus on strike incidence and duration, he does not consider the impact of the 1988 Constitution as 

well  as  he  employed  only  Cox  proportional  model  to  assess  strike  duration.  Least,  our  empirical 

background appears to be better than his. 

Less  researched  by  economists,  however,  it  is  the  impact  of  legislation  changes  on  strike 

dynamics. Analyzing the influence of collective bargaining legislation on strikes, Cramton et al. (1999) 

verify  that  changes  in  negotiation  rules  determined  by  labor  rights  affect  the  power  of  relationship 

between unions and firms, not only influencing the incidence and the duration of strikes, but also wage 

agreements.  As  well,  those  authors  note  that  agreement  policies  have  been  ineffective  in  reducing  the 

costs  of  strikes.  An  important  interpretation  of  the  study  is  that  the  uncertainty  of  unions  about  the 

propensity of the wages paid by firms has been positively and significantly related to the incidence and 

duration of the stoppages. The following section describes the database and the treatment of variables in 

the estimations.

Data Set Description 

 

The  strikes  database  consists  of  information  about  urban  stoppages  in  Brazil,  covering  the 

period  1983-1991,  and  was  obtained  from  the  Consortium  of  Social  Information  (CIS  –  Consórcio  de 
Informações  Sociais4).  Noronha  et  al.  (1998)  was  in  charge  of  its  construction  and  based  it  on  survey 
information from the Ministry of Labour and from DIEESE (Departamento Intersindical de Estatística e 

Estudos  Socioeconômicos  -  Department  of  Statistics  and  Socioeconomic  Studies).  The  unemployment 

rate by sector  –  due  to more  specific  reference to the  sector in  which  the  strike  occurs  –  was  obtained 

from  Getúlio  Vargas  Foundation  (FGV  –  Fundação  Getúlio  Vargas),  and  the  inflation  rate  from  IPEA 

(Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada – Institute of Applied Economic Research). The price index 

IGP-DI  (Índice  Geral  de  Preços  (Disponibilidade  Interna)  –  General  Price  Index  –  (Domestic 

Availability))  –  is  used as  an index  of  inflation.  The  sample also includes  information  on  geographical 

location of strikes (states and regions), sector of activity (commercial, industrial or service) and also if the 

                                                 
4  The  CIS  (Consórcio  de  Informações  Sociais  –  Consortium  of  Social  Information)  collects  social  scientific  information  in 
Brazil, aiming to offer free qualitative and quantitative data resulting from researches. It is maintained by the Department of 
Sociology  at  University  of  São  Paulo  and  the  National  Association  of  Graduate  Studies  and  Research  in  Social  Sciences 
(ANPOCS), with financial and material support from USP and FAPESP.

Length (duration) of strikes ranges from 1 to 211 days, with a cumulative frequency of 99% at 64 days 
(Appendix – Table 8) – thus, this study will consider only the strikes up to 60 days6. In turn, the number 

of  strikers  ranges  from  4  to  7.000.000,  with  a  cumulative  frequency  of  90%  up  to  6400  and  strikers 
(Appendix – Table 9). Thus, in this paper we will only include cases up to 6.500 strikers7. 

Brazilian  strikes  present  two  main  characteristics:  short  duration  (stoppages  up  to  3  days 

correspond  to  about 40% of  the  cases)  and  moderate  size  (strikes  up  to  100  strikers  correspond to  less 

than 20% of cases and up to 450 strikers more than half of the cases). Although there is no consensus in 

the  economic  literature,  low  duration  can  be  explained  by  situations  where  a  threat  to  strike  is  not 

considered  credible  by  companies  –  when  strikes  really  occur,  negotiations  are  more  effective,  thus 

agreements are reached in a shorter period of time. In the second case, schoolars attempt to explain the 

strikes size as a measure of bargaining power: if stoppages are composed by a large number of strikers, 

then the movement is characterized by a higher level of organization of workers, usually associated with 

unions; on the other hand, the strikes composed by a small number of strikers are associated with the most 

important sectors of the economy, characterized by fewer employees and greater bargaining power. Thus, 

the information about strikes suggests that Brazil is an intermediate case.  

Due  to  strong  concentration  on  the  left  distribution  of  the  number  of  strikers,  the  use  of 

absolute  values in  the Cox  proportional  hazards  model  generates  an estimated  coefficient very  close  to 

                                                 
5 Strikes category are characterized by stoppages that are not represented by a specific group of workers from a company, but 
by all employees of companies related to the same labor category, usually associated with a representative union that organizes 
and coordinates joint actions.

unity, not allowing an appropriate interpretation of results. The alternative adopted in this study to avoid 

this problem was the creation of dummy variables representing cohorts of number of strikers, allowing to 

determine  the  variation  of  hazard  rate  according  to  their  ranges.  To  define  the  cohorts  adopted  in  this 

study  we  consider  the  cases  that  demonstrate  significance  of  coefficients  in  the  Cox  model  and  no 

violation  of  proportional  hazards  assumption  in  Wilcoxon  and  logrank  tests.  Thus,  we  selected  three 

cohorts that attend these two requirements: the cohort ranging up to 300 strikers (about 46% cumulative 

frequency), from 300 to 1.000 (73.5%) and above 1.000. 

Following the methodology adopted by Perez et al. (2006), we included variables representing 

unemployment rate in current year (as control variable to verify the effects of economic cycles on strikes 

duration) and the inflation rate in previous year (as a proxy for expected inflation by unions in contractual 

negotiations,  mainly  influencing  the  wage  claims).  Table  2  summarizes  the  characteristics  of  variables

Note  that  the  dummy  for  the  state  of  São  Paulo  has  a  considerable  representation,  not  only  for  his 

percentage  (about  43%  of  the  sample)  but  mainly  because  the  state  is  the  place  of  the  most  important 

strikes  and  union  activities  in the  country  in  the period  of  analysis.  Since  our  paper  aims  to  verify  the 

impact of institutional changes due to the Federal Constitution reformulation, it is important to note that 

the  constitutional  dummy  indicates  that  the  period  after  1988  period  accounts  for  nearly  half  of  the 

sample.  The  other  binary  variables  are  also  representative,  as  the  industrial  sector  dummy  presents  the 

highest  proportion,  with  about  half  of  the  sample,  the  service  sector  corresponding  about  46%  and  the 

commercial sector accounts for only less than 5%. The category strikes represent only 15% of the sample.

The sample includes information about strikes started in different companies and institutions 

in  the  national  territory.  Thus,  considering  the  regional  differences  (geographical  and  institutional,  for 

example), the assumption of no specific distribution of the information is reasonable, justifying the use of 

semi-parametric estimator of Cox.

Methodology 

 

We  present  first  the  characteristics  of  duration  and  survival  function  (not  considering  the 

effects  of  covariates)  by  means  of  the  Cox  proportional  hazards  model,  emphasizing  the  impact  of  the 

promulgation of the Brazilian Constitution in 1988. Following, covariates are included, initially checking 

for  their  individual  representativeness  by  testing  the  hypothesis  of  equality  of  survival  curves.  Table  3 

presents  information  about  strikes  duration.  The  data  is  uncensored  –  also  called  complete  data. 

Considering only strikes up to 60 days, the average duration is around 8 days and the median duration is 5 

days. The survival time (expressed in terms of cumulative frequency shows that the expectation of a strike 

ends up to 2 days is 25%, up to 5 days (the median duration) is 50% and the probability of ending up to 

10 days is 75%.

For  purpose  of  analysis  of  the  slopes  and  the  distance  between  the  survival  functions  in  pre  and  post-

constitutional  periods,  figure  2  presents  the  Kaplan-Meier  curves  for  both  periods.  The  initial  slope 

suggests that there is a significant reduction in the probability of continuity of strikes in the early days – 

corroborating the histogram. The distance between the curves also evidences the distinction between the 

characteristics of the stoppages over the periods, confirming a tendency of higher strikes duration after 

1988.

The assumption of equality of survival curves between periods should be verified. Logrank and Wilcoxon 

statistical tests are performed to check if there are significant differences between times to failure. The 

tests present the null hypothesis of both groups having identical survival and hazard functions, where the 

alternative  hypothesis  of  significant  differences  between  the  curves  suggests  that  the  inclusion  of  the 

variable in the estimation is adequate. The difference between the statistical tests is that the logrank test 

equally  weights  all  points  of  the  estimated  survival  curve,  while  the  Wilcoxon  test  weights  more  the 

10/20 

 

 
initial points of time. Following the methodology adopted by Giolo and Colosimo (2006), we include in 

the model the variables that present a p-value less than 0.25 in at least one test of comparison of survival 

curves.  

The basic assumption of the Cox model is that failure rates are proportional, that is, the risk 

for  an  individual  is  proportional  to  the  risk  for  another  individual,  with  constant  rate  over  time  (not 

depending on the duration). Assuming that we have  p  independent variables that satisfy the proportional 

hazards can be rewritten as:

The  next  step  is  to  verify  the  proportional  hazards  assumption,  using  a  chi-square  statistical  test 

performed for each variable (adjusted for the other variables included in the model). According to the test 

of  proportional  hazards  based  on  scaled  Schoenfeld  residuals  (Table  5),  only  for  post-constitutional 

dummy the hypothesis is not satisfied, indicating that the coefficient (as well as the proportional hazards) 

is not constant over time, reducing his efficiency. Note that the lack of a constant hazard rate for the post-

constitutional period flags a possible “effect” of the new Constitution. In fact, although a bit speculative, 

we interpreted that as an outcome of (incomplete) information and learning dynamics that might have a 

bite to explain strike dynamics after the enacting of the 1988 new Constitution!

The rejection of the null hypothesis suggests only that the residual is not constant over time, but does not 

demonstrate the sign of correlation, where the graphical representation show if the correlation with time is 

positive  or  negative.  Thus,  the  graphical  representation  of  the  test  is  visually  more  informative.  The 

relation between the scaled Schoenfeld residuals and time is presented in figure 3, demonstrating that the 

residuals are positively related for strikes until 8 days, with some variations in subsequent periods.

When  the  proportional  hazards  assumption  is  not  satisfied,  the  procedure  is  the  stratification  or  the 

inclusion  of  time-varying  covariates.  The  post-Constitutional  dummy  is  time-invariant,  thus  the 

specification of the model should consider the first case – also including in the model other variables that 

satisfy the hypothesis of proportional hazards. The general form of the stratified Cox model allows the 

stratification of several regressors.  The hazard function of the stratified Cox model is expressed by:

Where  the  subscript  g   indicates  each  cohort  of  the  model  and  ρ  is  the  number  of  regressors.  The 

difference from the initial model is that in the stratified model the hazard functions for different periods 

are not the same, with distinct baseline hazard functions, that is, 

h g0

 is defined for each cohort of the 

model,  but  coefficients

K   are  identical.  Due  to  these  differences  in  baseline  functions,  the 

,

adjusted Cox model will generate different survival curves for each cohort. Also, the same coefficients 

will  generate  similar  hazard  functions.  This  characteristic  is  denominated  no  interaction  effects 

assumption. 

The model without interaction considers only one set of coefficients valid for the cohort, that 

is, assumes that the Constitutional dummy variable has no interaction with other independent variables in 
the  model.  If  we  allow  the  interaction,  then  different  coefficients  are  expected  for  each  cohort8, 

representing the expected result to estimate proportional hazard models separately for the distinct period. 

The definition of the correct stratified model involves comparisons between the specifications with and 

without interaction, checking for the multiplicative impact of the variable that violates the assumption of 

proportional hazards with other independent variables. The null hypothesis suggests the use of the model 

without  interaction.  The  stratified  Cox  model  with  interaction  is  defined  by  equation  3,  where  each

To statistically determine the appropriate model, we apply a log-likelihood test9 comparing the statistics 
of  the  stratified  Cox  specifications.  The  result  rejects  the  null  hypothesis10,  suggesting  the  use  of  the 

model with interactive variables. Thus, the model has two baseline hazard functions (due to stratification 

of  a  single  binary  variable),  where  the  coefficients  are  related  to  pre-and  post-constitutional  periods. 

Results are showed in Table 6. 

The  proportional  hazard  represents  the  risk  of  occurrence  of  an  event  –  in  this  analysis 

expresses the end of the strike. If the value is larger than unity, the variable positively affects the end of 

the strike – in other words, contributes to reduce the duration of stoppages. On the other hand, values less 

than  unity  increase  the  probability  of  greater  duration.  In  the  estimation,  the  results  indicate a  positive 

relationship  between  number  of  strikers  and  strikes  duration,  same  result  presented  by  inflation  in  the 

previous period. Equivalently, the unemployment rate and the strikes initiated in the state of São Paulo 

tend to reduce the duration of the stoppages.

For comparison purpose, table 7 presents the estimations of the Cox model separately. The results show 

different coefficients in the distinct periods, especially for the unemployment rate (where the reduction of 

the hazard ratio represents a propensity to more extensive strikes) and São Paulo dummy variable (with 

an increase in the proportional hazard). In turn, the inflation rate in the previous period has a significant 

relationship only in the pre-constitutional, with negative effect.

The adjustment of the model is analyzed by plotting the Cox-Snell residuals. If the model is correct, the 

graph  of  cumulative  hazard  in  respect  to  residuals  should  approximate  of  a  straight  line  with  unitary 

slope. Considering that the values up to 3 accounts for more than 95% of the data, we can conclude that 

the  model  Cox  has  a  satisfactory  level  of  adjustment.  Our  procedure  confirms  previous  results  and 

provides a more comprehensive analysis of the determinants of strikes in Brazil, allowing the comparison 

between the distinct periods. 

According to figure 5 we have an initial reduction in the slope of survival curves, indicating 

greater probability that a strike ends in the first days. A brief comparison between periods shows that after 

1988 there is an increasing trend in the duration of stoppages, demonstrated by the upper survival curve.

Figure 6 shows the proportional hazard function (smoothed). The curves for the periods before and after 

Constitution are parallel, and the first has a higher failure rate – showing that, for a given duration, the 

probability of ending a strike is lower after 1988, i.e., mean duration is higher. Also the shape of the 

function indicates that the hazard is increasing in the initial period, starting to decrease around the 14th 

day and increasing again from 34th day of stoppage, with subsequent expressive raise in their rates.

Final Considerations 

5. 

 

The  main  difference  between  characteristics  of  strikes  that  occurred  in  Brazil  and  those  in 

other countries is the time of the stoppage –Brazilian work stoppages are usually shorter. The database 

used  in  this  paper  includes  information  about  approximately  15,000  strikes,  and  only  about  2%  were 

longer than 45 days and 1% than 60 days. While in Brazil strikes have an average only of 8 days and a 

 

15/20 

 
median of 5 days, the average duration of strikes in the manufacture sector in the United States and in 

Canada ranges from 40 to 50 days, and the median ranges from 25 to 40 days [Card (1990)]. According to 

Picchetti (2002), this fact is due to the Brazilian legislation (which avoids conflicts on negotiations) and 

by the significant role of trade unions to support strikes – more bargaining power means reduction of time 

stoppages.  Duration  of  strikes  in  Brazil  is  similar  to  those  values  observed  in  Spain,  where  the  mean 

duration is 5.75 days and the median is 3 days [Pérez et al. (2006)], in the Netherlands, where the mean 

range from 2 to 12 days and in France, from 1 to 8 days [Butter and Koppes (2003)]. 

This  paper  evidences  differences  in characteristics  of  strikes  before and  after  the  1988  new 

constitutional law. Besides the distinction between the non-parametric survival curves between periods, 

tests  of  equality  of  survival  function  confirm  the  appropriate  use  of  the  variable  representing  the  post 

Federal Constitution in the model. The initial results of the Cox model estimation showed a significant 

proportional reduction in risk, indicating that the strikes starting after 1988 have a propensity to be longer. 

The  violation  of  the  proportional  hazards  assumption  –  indicating  that  the  coefficient  of  the  post 

constitutional dummy is not constant over time – can be attributed to differences in the characteristics of 

strikes  in  the  two  periods,  which  requires  a  stratified  Cox  model  to  capture  the  distinct  effects.  In 

addition,  the  final  specification  by  stratified  Cox  model  with  interacted  covariates  also  specifies  the 

difference between the coefficients of the estimations according to considered period. 

Results indicate that the number of strikes is positively related to the duration of stoppages, 

consistent  with  found  by  Harrison  and  Stewart  (1993)  for  Canadian  strikes  for  wage  claims  up  to  500 

strikers, but different to verified in Spanish strikes by Perez et al. (2006) and Canadian strikes by Cramton 

et  al.  (1999).  However,  there  is  not  a  significant  difference  in  mean  durations  between  the  cohorts  of 

strikers considered in this research, resulting in 7.6 days in the case of stoppages up to 300 strikers, 8 days 

for the stoppages with 300 to 1.000 strikers and 8.8 days for the stoppages with more than 1.000 strikers.  

In  turn,  the  inflation  rate  is  positively  related  with  strikes  duration  only  in  the  pre-
constitutional  period11.  Vroman  (1989)  finds  a  negative  relation,  suggesting  that  although  the  agents 

involved in the negotiations have common understanding regarding the need to an update on wages, they 

disagree on the level of adjustment to be accomplished – and as larger the inflation, larger the differences 

between  the  values  negotiated.  Perez  et  al.  (2006)  finds  a  positive  relationship  between  inflation  and 

strikes  duration  for  the  negotiations  that  do  not  result  in  agreement,  while  it  is  negative  in  strikes  that 

result in agreement; but in the full sample, the variable does not demonstrate statistical significance. 

The  unemployment  rate  presents  an  inverse  relationship  with  the  strikes  duration  in  both 

periods. This results are consistent with the ones obtained by Card (1990), McConnell [apud Card (1990)] 

and Picchetti (2002), but different to the ones reported by Vroman (1989) and Cramton et al. (1999); also, 

                                                 
11 Although statistically significant, inflation showed no effect on the strikes duration in the post-constitutional period, because 
the coefficient is close to zero (proportional hazard close to one). 

16/20 

 

 
no statistical significance was found by Pérez et al. (2006). The economic literature shows that the impact 

of unemployment on the strikes duration is ambiguous – the final effect is the result of specific conditions 

of each economy.  

In  Brazil,  the negative  relationship between  unemployment  and strikes  duration may  reflect 

larger bargaining power of firms relative to the unions – when unemployment rates rise, the difference 

between  the  wages  offered  and  demanded  tends  to  be  lower,  increasing  the  probability  of  reaching  an 

agreement and thus reducing the time of the strikes. The reduction of hazard rate in the post-constitution 

period can be the effect of increased organizational level and greater bargaining power of unions, which 

implies in reduction of the impact of changes in unemployment on the wage differential proposed in the 

negotiations, increasing the duration of stoppages. 

The State of São Paulo is historically the place of the most important and largest strikes in the 

country,  and  also  where  most  unions  and  workers  associations  originated.  The  inclusion  of  a  dummy 

variable representing the state demonstrate a significant and higher hazard rate, that is, the strikes started 

in companies or institutions in São Paulo have a propensity to lower durations – mainly due to the role of 

unions  in  strikes  and  to  the  important  characteristic  of  Brazilian  legislation  supporting  the  negotiations 

realized by unions and labor organizations [Picchetti (2002)]. In the post-constitutional period, the hazard 

rate is smaller, but still demonstrates a shorter duration of strikes relative to other states. This result can 

be interpreted as the effect of stricter regulatory laws in the labor relations, inducing to more organized 

strikers and the development of clearer rules. The main strikes were initiated in São Paulo, thus this effect 

tends to be more evident in that state. 

Strikes are usually the result of collective bargaining between firms and workers in periods of 

contract renewal or under economic instability or also when the parties do not reach an agreement, being 

induced by improvements in economic or working conditions. The economic literature suggests that the 

main  cause  of  strikes  is  asymmetric  information  –  for  example,  the  relationship  between  wages  and 

remuneration with the productivity can be more directly observed by firms than by workers. Our results 

point out that strike size, dummies for São Paulo state and the period after the Federal Constitution play 

the most significant roles on strikes duration. Thus, this study found that patterns of strikes duration have 

changed between pre and post-constitutional periods, concluding that the promulgation of the new federal 

legislation  had  non-negligible  impacts  on  duration  and  characteristics  of  strikes,  yet  to  be  fully 

understood.
