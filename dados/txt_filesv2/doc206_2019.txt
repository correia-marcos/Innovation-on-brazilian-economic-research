Abstract
We evaluate the Brazilian Family Health Strategy (FHS), the largest community-based health program
in Brazil, estimating how it aﬀects contraceptive use and health behaviors among adult and teenage
women, as well as fertility rates and HIV diagnosis among teenage girls. We use publicly-available
data to estimate program eﬀects at individual and municipality levels. We employ propensity score
matching combined with complex survey weights in individuals regressions and a diﬀerences-in-
diﬀerences approach for municipalities. The results indicate the program has positive eﬀects on the
probability of using various types of contraceptive methods, mainly observed in condoms and pills
and their combination. This result is found especially among women in households with a female
teenager. Following this, we found negative and robust eﬀects on adolescent maternity rate, with a
monotonous decrease following exposure time to the program, especially among older teenage girls
aged 15-19. In addition, we found that the decrease was higher in the poorest regions of Brazil, and
also that the program is related with an increase in the diagnosis rates of HIV/AIDS.

1. Introduction

Despite the progress that has been achieved in expanding health coverage worldwide (Dye et al.,
2013), adolescents are lagging behind regarding access to sexual and reproductive health services
(Coll et al., 2019). Reproductive and sexual health is essential to the well-being of individuals and
societies and is a driver for development (Rodríguez et al., 2014). Unplanned pregnancies, espe-
cially among poor adolescents, are associated with inadequate antenatal care, higher risk of medical
complications, preterm birth, low birth weight, infant mortality, maternal mortality and morbidity,
lower educational attainment, fewer work opportunities, and, ultimately, poverty (Glasier et al., 2006;
United Nations, 2014; Rodríguez et al., 2014).

Similar to most of high- and middle-income countries, Brazil has experienced a fast decline in
fertility rates since the 1970s, as a result of the demographic transition process (Maddison, 2001). In
particular, the fertility rate among Brazilian adolescents has also decreased, especially since the mid-
1990s. However, it is still higher than that of most countries in Latin America, as well as the global
average (63 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19, against a global average of 44) (United Nations,
2014). Despite contraception being widely available throughout the country (de Leon et al., 2019),
adolescents are aﬀected by social norms and expectations in a particular manner. Furthermore, their
lack of interest for general family planning services hamper the decrease of the adolescent fertility rate
(Gonçalves et al., 2011). In the 1990s, after the establishment of the Brazilian National Health System,
Brazil launched the Family Health Strategy (FHS) aiming to reach the most vulnerable populations
and achieve a more equitable society (Datasus, 2019). Over the past years, the expansion of the
FHS allowed people from harder-to-reach groups to access health services and improve several health
outcomes (Mullachery et al., 2016).

This paper investigates the eﬀects of the FHS expansion on contraceptive use among adult women
and health behaviors of both adult and teenage women, exploring potential diﬀerences according to
family structure (presence of adult women in the household and presence of teenage boys and girls).
Determinants of risky sexual behaviors have been studied over the past decades (Wellings et al., 2001).
Girls who live alone or with non-relatives usually have more risky sexual behaviours than girls who
live with their parents or relatives (Curtis et al., 2018). Parents can aﬀect adolescents’ sexual behavior
via their example, expectations and communication (Hutchinson et al., 2003; Kowal and Blinn-Pike,
2004). Parent-child sexual risk communication has been associated with more responsible sexual
attitudes and behaviors among sexually active adolescents (Hutchinson et al., 2003).

We also explore the eﬀects of FHS expansion on fertility rates and HIV diagnosis among females
aged 10 to 19. Moreover, since previous works have found that the FHS seems to be most eﬀective in
the north and northeast regions of Brazil, and in municipalities with a lower coverage of public health
infrastructure Rocha and Soares (2010), we focus on these regions on a secondary analysis.

Estimation regarding fertility and HIV rates are conducted with a panel of all Brazilian munici-
palities covering the period 1996 to 2016, with a speciﬁcation that takes advantage of the staggered
roll-out of the program to adopt a diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences strategy that explores time of exposure.
Individual-level analyses are carried out with a cross-section survey of individuals, containing infor-
mation on health characteristics and FHS visits, using Propensity Score methods.

Eﬀects of the FHS on child health were already documented, especially regarding infant mortality,
nutrition and early development (Bhalotra et al., 2019; Macinko et al., 2006, 2007; Rocha and Soares,
2010; Bastos et al., 2017). FHS can aﬀect fertility rates directly, through provision of family planning
services, and indirectly, as a response to the decline in infant mortality (Bhalotra et al., 2019). Its
eﬀects on sexual and reproductive health have been studies as well Bhalotra et al. (2019); however,
to the best of our knowledge, information about how the FHS aﬀects teenage fertility and about the
pathways of its eﬀects on adolescent maternity have not been evaluated until now.

At the individual level, we found that the decrease in fertility was accompanied by increase of
contraceptive use for women in covered households. Higher eﬀects of FHS on contraception were
found for use of male condom (8.4 percentage points (pp)) and for the combo of male condom and
contraceptive pill (13.3 pp). Its eﬀects were even higher among households with a female adolescent,
reaching an increase of 25.6 pp on the probability of using both condom and contraceptive pill. FHS
coverage was also associated with an increase of 14.5 pp on the use of contraceptive condom, 34.5 pp
on the use of combined pill and condom.

At the municipality level, we found complementary results, with a clearly decline on adolescent
fertility rate along the implementation of the FHS. The decrease of the rate for 10-19 years old girls
presents a steady drop reaching a decrease of 9.2% with 8 years of implementation. According to
age group, eﬀects reach a decrease around 15.6% and 9.4% among girls aged 10-14 and 15-19 years,
respectively, after 8 years of program. In the poorest regions of the country (north and northeast), we
ﬁnd that the exposure to the program has a greater magnitude on female teenage fertility reaching a
decline of 33% after 5 years and 64% after 10 of program implementation, among girls aged 10-19.
We also found positive eﬀect of the program on the HIV/AIDS diagnosis rate.

The paper proceeds as follows. Following this introduction, section 2 presents an overview of the
Family Health Strategy, while section 3 provides a brief review of the relevant literature. Section 4
describes the data sets used, detailing our variables of analysis. In section 5, we outline the empirical
strategies employed to address municipal- and individual-level data. Section 6 presents and discusses
our estimation results, including robustness exercises. Final remarks are presented in section 7.

2. The Brazilian Family Health Strategy

The implementation of the Family Health Program, currently known as Family Health Strategy
(FHS), began in 1994 in northeastern Brazil. The objective of the program is to promote access to
free-of-charge health care to the general population, especially those at the margins. The FHS is a
federal initiative under the Brazilian Ministry of Health that has reorganized basic care provision in the
country, decentralizing primary care to the municipality-level. The program has had a strong focus on
expansion and qualiﬁcation of primary care, beneﬁtting over 120 million people (Macinko and Harris,
2015; Bastos et al., 2017). It works mainly towards prevention and provision of basic health through
the use of professional health care teams directly intervening within communities. The teams provide
health counseling - including orientation of good habits of hygiene and food safety, but also proper
antenatal and postnatal care and breastfeeding practices -, deliver preventive care (e.g. immunization
campaigns) and act towards early diagnosis of diseases (Rocha and Soares, 2010).

The FHS is widely spread in Brazil: the population covered by the program has progressively
increased from around 7% in 1998 to around 63% in 2015 (Macinko and Harris, 2015; Bastos et al.,
2017). Implementation has been gradually spread across the country over time, providing an opportu-
nity for a non-experimental impact evaluation that explores the staggered expansion. Nowadays, the
FHS has already reached over 99% of Brazilian municipalities. Being such a large nationwide pro-
gram, the amount of public investment involved in its implementation and execution is substantial, at
the equivalent of was 5.32 billions US$ in 2010, and over 5.6 billions US$ in 2018, according to the
Brazilian Ministry of Health, making it one of the biggest public policies in Brazil.

The program is carried out within communities by so-called Family Health teams. Each team con-
sists of a group of several health professionals, including a minimum of one: (i) general practitioner;
(ii) nurse; (iii) auxiliary or nursing technician; and (iv) at least four community health agents. The
teams cover populations of at most 4,000 inhabitants each, being arranged with responsibilities for
a given geographical area. The covered populations receive regular visits by the community health
agents, in addition to having access to medical care at a basic health unit. This continuous care allows
agents to serve a broad range of people, from pregnant women, who are referred to prenatal care; new
mothers and their children, who are counseled towards best practices during postpartum and breast-
feeding; to adolescents, adults and the elderly, healthy or sick, in an integral and continuous manner.
Several works have done an excellent job of detailing the history and operation of the FHS, for further
information see, e.g., Rocha and Soares (2010); Castro et al. (2019); Bhalotra et al. (2019)

3. Brief literature review

Health-focused interventions targeting communities formed by disadvantaged families are a key
factor in promoting health improvements, giving access to information on disease prevention and
early detection. To the extent that people respond to the exposition to information, this would directly
inﬂuence their behavior (Becker, 2009), thus promoting better health in general. The provision of
health education services and contraceptives is obviously relevant for the prevention of unplanned
pregnancy, particularly during adolescence. When teenage pregnancy cannot be prevented, pregnant
girls are left at high risk for the complications before, during and after childbirth (Chen et al., 2007).
Long-term health consequences associated with teenage pregnancy are then an additional burden to
the public health system (Irvine et al., 1997).

Studies show that the main factors leading to pregnancy during adolescence are a lack of basic
information and attention. The presence of a mother ﬁgure seems to be particularly important, and
greatly aﬀects the adolescent (Hutchinson et al., 2003). The literature reports that there is a strong
relationship between the attitudes of older women at a household and adolescent sexual behavior and
contraceptive use, with some studies indicating that it is the adult woman in a family who passes on
the use of contraceptives to teenage girls; this happens not only with mothers, but also older sisters,
aunts and other female relatives (Curtis et al., 2018). Rodgers and Rowe (1993) showed that older
sibling behavior directly aﬀects younger siblings, including teenagers, who become sexually active
earlier than their older siblings. Kowal and Blinn-Pike (2004) investigated the eﬀects of the inﬂuence
of parents and elders on adolescent sexual behavior and found that discussions between siblings about
safe sex, in conjunction with discussions between parents, predicted better attitudes toward safe sexual
practices for adolescents.

Simple dissemination of health education to families can be an important mechanism to overcome
lack of information Duﬂo et al. (2015). Dupas (2011) conducted a large study in Kenya with a
randomized, seven-year trial to explore the impacts of disseminating information about adolescent
sexual behavior; they found that when parents received information about the risks of HIV infection,
there was a decrease in the probability of teenage pregnancy. An opposing force is that presented
by Hotz et al. (1997), who explain that a teenager who engages in sex only sporadically may not be
willing to invest in contraceptive methods with high ﬁxed costs and low marginal costs, while a more
sexually active teenager might make such investments.

The evaluations of Family Health Strategy begun with the study of Macinko et al. (2006), who
used a state-year panel spanning the period from 1990 to 2002 and found that an increase in FHS
coverage was associated with a drop in the infant mortality rate. Macinko et al. (2007) analyzed
data from microregions in Brazil from 1999 to 2004, with results suggesting that an increase in FHS
coverage was associated with reductions in infant mortality from various causes (0.45% reduction in
the infant mortality rate, 6% in post-neonatal mortality and 1% in mortality from diarrhea).

4

Rocha and Soares (2010) used a municipality-level panel to estimate the impacts of the FHS mor-
tality rates from several causes and for various age groups, with additional analyses regarding school-
ing, labor supply and fertility. Their results show that FHS had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the reduction in
infant and adult mortality, with stronger eﬀects among the poorest regions. They also found that the
program had a signiﬁcant impact on labor supply, enrollment rates and fertility reductions. However,
they found no eﬀect on fertility rates among adolescents. Guanais (2015) also used a panel of munic-
ipalities and a ﬁxed-eﬀects strategy, and estimated that the FHS, combined with the conditional cash
transfer program Bolsa Família, led to reductions in post-neonatal mortality. More recently, Bhalotra
et al. (2019) used a similar strategy to estimate the eﬀects of the FHS, but explored a wide range of
outcomes. They used a rich administrative data set in conjunction with a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences
methodology, with results suggesting that the program is associated with a large reduction in fetal,
neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality, as well as with a decrease in maternal mortality. Addition-
ally, the authors found that the program led to an increase in C-sections, hospital births and maternal
hospitalization following complications at birth, as well as an increase in antenatal care consultation.
Our contribution to this literature is in addressing the question of how the Family Health Strategy
in Brazil is associated with outcomes of reproductive and sexual health with a direct focus on adoles-
cence. We attempt to estimate whether the FHS aﬀects contraceptive use and health behaviors among
adult women under diﬀerent household structures - with or without teenage girls and boys -, and
whether the program had an impact on fertility rates and HIV diagnosis among female adolescents
aged 10 to 19.

4. Data

We take advantage of publicly-available administrative data to perform analyses at individual and
municipal levels. First, we use data from a survey of Brazilian residents conducted in 2013 by the
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). This survey, called Pesquisa Nacional da
Saúde (PNS), gathered information on the health, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics
of all members of the households interviewed, selected via complex sampling to ensure population
representativity.

Importantly, households reported whether they had received at least one visit from a FHS com-
munity health agent in the last 12 months, which we use to identify treatment status. Our outcomes
of interest are related to contraceptive use and health behavior. Since questions related to sexual ac-
tivity were only answered by legal adults (18 or more years old), we cannot estimate the association
between the FHS and these outcomes among teenagers directly. For this reason, we analyze contra-
ceptive use and health behaviors among adult women living in diﬀerent household structures. We
do this in order to investigate how the presence of female adolescents in the family inﬂuences the
dissemination of the program regarding contraceptive methods. Additionally, we estimate how the
FHS aﬀects the probability of visiting a medical doctor among teenage women. Hence, we divided
our sample into two strands: (i) a subsample of sexually active women aged 18-49 (furter split con-
sidering the presence of teenage boys and/or girls in the household); and (ii) a subsample of female
adolescents aged 10-19 (further split by age groups 10-14 and 15-19 and by considering the presence
or not of adult women in the household1).

Dependent variables on contraceptive use were carefully constructed by considering as non-
adopters (women not using contraceptives) those who self-reportedly: (i) wanted to get pregnant;
(ii) did not use contraceptives for religious reasons; (iii) did not know how to use contraceptive meth-
ods; or (iv) did not know where to ﬁnd the information. We exclude from the sample women who:

1For this analysis, we considered that households with adult women were those where there lived at least one sexually

active woman aged 20-49.

5

(i) were pregnant; (ii) were not sexually active; or (iii) did not have sex with men. We omitted the
descriptive statistics because of space limitations, but they are available with the authors upon request.
Second, our municipality-level analysis relies on several administrative databases. We construct
a panel including all municipalities in Brazil spanning the period from 1996 to 2016. Our panel
includes: (i) Data on teenage fertility and number of HIV/AIDS diagnoses, available from the Live
Birth Information System (SINASC) and the Notiﬁcation of Injury Information System (SINAN),
via the Ministry of Health’s Integrated System of Information (DATASUS); (ii) year of program
implementation for each municipality is obtained from the Ministry of Health’s Department of Basic
Attention2; (iii) control variables related to municipalities’ infrastructure come from the education
census, available from the Ministry of Education’s National Institute for Educational Studies and
Research (INEP), and include characteristics such as the proportion of public school teachers with
a graduate degree and the proportion of public schools in rural areas. At the end, this municipality-
year panel is composed of 5,509 municipalities with data from 1996 to 2016, for a total of 115,689
observations. Again, descriptive statistics were omitted for space considerations and are available
with the authors upon request.

5. Empirical Strategy

Because of the diﬀerent nature of our individual and municipal-level data, we adopt two distinct
empirical approaches. First, for the individual-level data, we explore the impacts of the Family Health
Strategy on two sets of outcomes (contraceptive use among adult women and health behaviors among
teenage and adult women) using matching and weighting procedures. Under the hypothesis that the
presence of adolescent girls in a household might aﬀect the ability of health care programs to inﬂuence
the behaviors of other women (Curtis et al., 2018), similarly to how it could aﬀect the inﬂuence of
adult women on the teenage girls (Wellings et al., 2001), we explore diﬀerent household structures
regarding the presence of adolescents and adults.

Since the PNS is a survey designed with complex sampling, matching procedures are not trivial.
However, employing Propensity Score methods with complex surveys is becoming increasingly com-
mon (Zanutto, 2006; DuGoﬀ et al., 2014; Austin et al., 2018; Ely et al., 2019). According to DuGoﬀ
et al. (2014), combining propensity score methods with appropriate survey weighting is necessary
to achieve unbiased treatment eﬀect estimates that can be generalized to achieve the original survey
target population. After running Monte Carlo simulations, they suggested using a type of propensity
score weighting in which the weights from the propensity score are multiplied by the survey weights.
Austin et al. (2018), on the other hand, assessed the performance of diﬀerent methods of matching un-
der complex sampling and concluded that a Propensity Score Matching with complex survey weights
employed during the ﬁrst stage provides the less bias.

Given this discussion, we estimate the individual-level impacts of the FHS under three diﬀerent
models, for every dependent variable. The ﬁrst model is a simple Probit regression using complex
survey weights. The second model uses Propensity Score Weighting with weights from both the
logistic regression and the complex survey (PSW). In order to estimate this model, we ﬁrst run a
logistic regression using the survey weights and then run a linear regression using the weights from
the logistic regression multiplied by the survey weights, following the recommendations of DuGoﬀ
et al. (2014). Our last model uses Propensity Score Matching with complex survey weights (PSM),
following Austin et al. (2018). To estimate the third model, we ﬁrst run a nearest-neighbor algorithm
with replacement to match treated and control individuals and then run a linear regression using the

2Due to data availability we ignore any coverage that was already in place in 1994 and 1995. Since coverage was

minimum during this period, we believe this does not pose issue to our estimation strategy.

survey weights3. Throughout our results discussions, we focus on the estimates obtained from the
third model.

The treatment variable is a dummy that indicates if the household received visits of FHS in the
past 12 months. Control variables are related to individuals’ skin color, age, years of study and
households’ people density by room, number of women, presence of piped water, indicator for rural
areas and states.

Our individual-level empirical speciﬁcation is the following:

First stage:

p(FHS j) = α + β.Xi j + τ.Z j + µi j

Second stage on the matched sample:

Yi j = γ + λ.FHS j + ω.Xi j + σ.Z j + i j

(1)

(2)

In equation (1), the ﬁrst stage, p(FHS j) is the probability of receiving the FHS, Xi j and Z j denote
a set of characteristics of individuals and households, respectively, µi j is the random error term, and
α, β and τ are parameters. For the second stage, in equation (2), Yi j denotes some health outcome
for the matched individual (either contraceptive use or health behavior), FHS j is the treatment status,
and γ, λ, ω and σ are parameters. Standard errors are clustered at the household level.

Unfortunately, Propensity Score methods are known to have some limitations. This methodology
attempts to mimic randomization by creating a sample of units who did not receive the treatment that
is comparable on observables to the sample of units who did receive the treatment (Rosenbaum, 2014).
The main limitation here is the possibility that some non-observable characteristics might inﬂuence
treatment status, which would only be captured in the analysis to the extent of their correlation with
the observed covariates. To address this, in addition to estimating our results with the three models
mentioned above, we also estimate Rosenbaum bounds to test the sensibility of our results to hidden
bias. Since our dependent variables are binaries we apply Rosenbaum bounds to McNemar’s test to
check diﬀerences in degree of departure from random assignment of treatment for variables between
two related groups.

For the second part of this paper, we explore the staggered roll-out of the Family Health Strategy
across municipalities in Brazil by adopting a diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences approach. Since our unit of
observation in this case is a municipality in a given year of from 1996 onward, we identify status
of treatment by observing year of implementation for each municipality. Treated municipalities are
those who were exposed to the program with at least one Family Health team at some point up to the
year they are observed in the data.

As such, the municipality-level empirical speciﬁcation to capture the pre and post timing of adop-

tion and diﬀerent time of program exposure is the following:

Ymt = α +

β j.FHS mt− j + δ.Xmt + µm + γst + tm + mt

(3)

where Ymt denotes some health outcome for municipality m in year t, FHS mt− j is a dummy variable
assuming value 1 if municipality m ﬁrst received the program in year t-j, Xmt denotes a set of time-

3Following the recommendations of (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2008; Lunt, 2013) to achieve balancedness of covariates,
we match with replacement and apply a caliper of 5%. We also consider secondary-degree interactions and include all
covariates as controls for the second stage regression.

j=−8

varying controls, µm is a municipality ﬁxed eﬀect, γst are state-year ﬁxed eﬀects, tm is a municipality-
speciﬁc linear time trend, mt is the random error term, and α, β j, and δ are parameters. We omit the
group with j = −1.

This speciﬁcation allows us to examine heterogeneous eﬀects of the program under diﬀerent times
of exposition by comparing the β j for diﬀerent levels of j. For simplicity, we also present these
results graphically. Furthermore, we cluster standard errors at the municipality level, following the
recommendations of Abadie et al. (2017). Additionally, the negative values of j function as a means
to assess the plausibility of the diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences parallel trends hypothesis by analyzing pre-
existing trends.

Such approach oﬀers two additional concerns. First, FHS implementation did not historically fol-
low a random assignment, in which case selection bias might threaten our strategy. With this concern
in mind, Rocha and Soares (2010) attempted to ﬁnd the determinants behind program implemen-
tation, and found that endogenous adoption did not seem to be problem. They found that political
orientation and ﬁxed initial characteristics were strongly correlated with the timing of adoption. This
diminishes our concerns about the potential endogeneity of program adoption. The second concern
is the possibility of confounding omitted factors correlated with both FHS and health outcomes. We
deal with this to the best of existing approaches by including ﬁxed eﬀect over several dimensions, as
well as municipality-speciﬁc time trends that control for any long-run linear trend diﬀerences over
characteristics across regions.

6. Results

In this section we present the results of our estimations. First, we present the impacts of the
Family Health Strategy on individuals. Second, we present the eﬀects of the FHS at the municipality
level. At the end, we present robustness checks of the results, analysis of sensitivity and confounding
factors.

6.1. Impact on Individuals

Tables 1 and 2 present the results from the impact of Family Health Strategy on use of contra-
ceptives methods and health behaviors for women aged 18 to 49 years old. Table 3 presents the
eﬀects of the FHS on health care for female teenagers over diﬀerent age groups: 10-19, 15-19 and
10-14 years old. We present results following the three methods described earlier: Probit, Propensity
score Weighting (PSW) and Propensity Score Matching (PSM). Diﬀerent household structures are
presented sequentially in columns and later in panels. All tables report the marginal coeﬃcients of
the regressions, and we have omitted the ﬁrst stages and balancedness tests for limitations in space.
In general, most covariates pass the balancedness test at a 5% signiﬁcance level. We are also not re-
porting estimation results for three diﬀerent samples: (i) all households, (ii) households with at least
one teenager and (iii) households without any teenagers.

In tables 1 and 2, we present the estimates of the eﬀects of the FHS for women living in: (i)
households with male teenagers, (ii) households with female teenagers and (ii) household with only
female teenagers. Following our preferred speciﬁcation (PSM), the subsample of women with teenage
men in the household seems to have the lowest impact on contraceptive use, compared to all other
samples.
In this case, we found a positive impact only on the probability of using the table as a
contraceptive method, with a magnitude of 5.6 pp, but only signiﬁcant at 10%. For health care, our
results show a positive eﬀect on the probability of having visited a doctor in the past 3 and 12 months,
and the probability of having taken a blood exam.

In contrast, when we turn to the eﬀects of the FHS on women living in households with the
presence of female teenagers, we found a positive increase in almost all methods of contraception.
These impacts are observed on the probability of using: any contraceptive methods, using permanent

8

contraceptive methods, non-permanent contraceptive methods, male condom, contraceptive pill in
combination with condoms, having a vasectomy and tubal ligation. Magnitudes are, respectively,
equal to 3.1pp, 6.4pp, 4.1pp, 8.6pp, 18.2pp, 3.6pp, 7.4pp and 4.1pp. We also observe an increase in the
conditional contraceptives use (probability of using pill conditional on using condom, and probability
of using condom conditional on using pill) of 13.7pp and 8.3pp, respectively. Women in households
where there are only teenage girls seem to be aﬀected in a similar manner to those living with girls and
girls+boys. However, magnitudes for this more restrictive sample are generally bigger, with eﬀects
on the probability of using permanent contraceptive, non-permanent contraceptive, condom and pill,
conditional pill and conditional condom at magnitudes of 7.5pp, 4.6pp, 34.5pp, 13.2pp and 11.8pp,
respectively. These results seem to indicate that women in households with the presence of teenage
women might be more susceptible to have their sexual behaviors aﬀected by health counseling.

As shown in table 1, FHS eﬀects on the probability of visiting a medical doctor and taking a
blood exam are also positive and seem to be strongly aﬀected by the presence of teenage girls in the
households, particularly for the subsample of only teenage girls. These results, when taken together,
seem to indicate greater impacts of the FHS on health behaviors of adult women when there are
teenage girls in the households, which could mean either a greater concern and susceptibility from
the women or greater care from the health professionals.

Finally, table 3 presents our estimates of the impacts of the FHS on health care outcomes among
female teenagers aged 10-19, sampled according to age group and household structure (presence or
not of adult women in household). For the sample of all households, the estimates are similar for
all age groups, with the FHS associated with an increased probability of visiting a doctor in the past
1 or 2 years. For teenagers aged 10-19 years old, the eﬀect of the program is of 3.4 pp and 3.2
pp, respectively. In households with adult women, the eﬀect of FHS on the health care of female
teenagers appears with greater magnitude, reaching 8.3 pp for girls aged 15-19. We do not ﬁnd
statistically signiﬁcant impacts among households without adult women.

6.2. Impact on Municipality

In this section we present the results of our municipality-level speciﬁcation. Table 4 presents the
long-run results of Family Health Strategy over teenage women fertility rate and HIV/AIDS diagnos-
tic rate. We analyze outcomes separately by three age groups: 10-19, 15-19 and 10-14 years old. We
also present these results graphically, plotting the coeﬃcients β j before and after program interven-
tion following equation (3), as well as their respective conﬁdence intervals (95%). The estimates are
interpreted as percentages in relation to the omitted group mean.

The estimates considering adolescents’ fertility rates are reported in table 4. Figures 2 to 4 show
a clear decline following exposure time to the program. The eﬀects seem to start in program year 3,
with a decline of approximately 3.9% in fertility, reaching a decline of 17.2% in year 5, and further
expanding to 28.2% after 8 years, relative to control group mean. Similarly, for teenage women with
age range of 15-19 years old, we also ﬁnd a negative impact. This impact starts with a decline of
4.3% in year 3, dropping to 6.0% in 4 years of implementation until the year 8, when it reaches 9.4%
on the 15-19 fertility rate. Finally, for the fertility for teenage women rate aged 10-14, we ﬁnd also a
decline of 7.4%, starting on FHS year 3, dropping to around of 23% at program year 8, and to 52.6%
in year 19 of FHS exposition.

Table 4 and ﬁgures 5 and 7 also provide the impact of the FHS on the diagnosis of HIV / AIDS.
We only found an increase in the diagnosis of HIV / AIDS for adolescent girls aged 10 to 19 and 15
to 19 years. But especially for this result, the program can have adverse eﬀects. The implementation
of the program can have two mechanisms. First, it may be that FHS causes adolescents to use more
contraceptive methods, which would probably cause the rate to drop. And second, the arrival of the
program may cause an increase in the number of HIV diagnoses, not actual new infections.

Finally, in a secondary analysis, ﬁgures 9 to 14 present the results of the long-run eﬀects of the
FHS in the north and northeast region of Brazil. In general, those ﬁgure shows a clear pattern of

9

decline on the teenage fertility rate in the program immediately in the ﬁrst year of implementation.
And this drop rises steadily until year 19 of program exposure in the municipality. The table with
the FHS regressions in the north and northeast of Brazil was omitted by considerations of space.
Overall, we also found a clear decline in the implementation of the FHS in the adolescent fertility rate.
However, this occurs with a greater magnitude because they are regions of poverty and diﬃcult access
to health. These results are in line with empirical evidence that community-based health intervention
and information dissemination lead to a reduction in the fertility of women. (Dupas, 2011; Duﬂo
et al., 2015; Bhalotra et al., 2019).

6.3. Confounding Factors and Sensitivity Analysis

Here we discuss the results of robustness tests, both for the municipal level and the individual
level regressions, available with the authors upon request. For the individual level regressions tables
1 to 3, we estimate Rosenbaum Bounds to check robustness of the results. This test assesses whether
the results might be aﬀected by omitted variables. In general, the results of this sensitivity analysis
support the conclusion of a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect of the FHS on the probabilities of contra-
ceptive use and also for the health care of female teenagers. The results start to become sensitive to
hidden bias when we use gammas higher than 1.6, with few exceptions in particular outcome like
table method.

For municipality-level regressions we use dummies placebos. This dummies were constructed to
investigate the eﬀects of the FHS in municipalities before the program implementation. This can be
seen both in tables 4 and ﬁgures 2 to 14. The placebo-like test is done using prior periods in which
the treatment has not yet occurred, using the dummies to capture the exposure time prior to program
intervention. In general, these estimates are not statistically signiﬁcant and follow a pattern. With
few exceptions, these coeﬃcients suggest that our empirical analysis is not threatened by non-parallel
trends, at least when assesses during pre-program periods.

7. Final Remarks

This paper provides the ﬁrst investigation on how the Family Health Strategy, Brazil’s federal ini-
tiative to expand access to primary care through a community-based home visiting approach, aﬀects
outcomes related to the sexual and reproductive health of adult and teenage women living in diﬀerent
household structures. We use a wide range of publicly available data to perform analyses at indi-
vidual and municipality levels adopting strategies of propensity score and diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences,
respectively.

Overall, our results at the individual level support the evidence that the Family Health Strategy
visits increase the likelihood of using contraceptive methods among women over the age of 18, and
this eﬀect occurs diﬀerently when we look at the diﬀerent household structures. We also found evi-
dence that, when the household has the presence of female adolescents, the eﬀect of the program on
the use of contraception is performed in greater magnitude. This evidence support the idea that when
the household has female teenagers the health professionals might be more concerned about dissemi-
nating contraceptive methods, as supported by, e.g., Hutchinson et al. (2003). The main mechanisms
of the FHS towards contraceptive use seem to be the male condom, the contraceptive pill and the com-
bination of both, which is the most eﬀective against unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted
diseases (Cates Jr and Steiner, 2002; Dupas, 2011).

The Family Health Strategy seems to aﬀect young girls at several ages. This is observed not once,
but twice using diﬀerent methods and data sets. We explore contraceptive use and the heterogeneity
eﬀect of the program on health outcomes. We found that the program has a negative impact on teenage
fertility rates throughout its implementation, which we interpret to be linked to an increased use of
contraceptive methods, as evidenced by the individual-level results.

10

We believe our ﬁndings to be important inputs for the discussion in low- and middle-income coun-
tries, where inequality is particularly striking, education attainment is low and the fertility rates among
teenagers is more prevalent. Programs such as the Family Health Strategy can be extremely important
in disseminating information about the importance of contraceptive methods and thus promoting their
use, especially for adolescents living in social vulnerability.
