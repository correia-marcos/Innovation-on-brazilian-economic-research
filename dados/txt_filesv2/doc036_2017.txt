1. Introduction 

 

Based  on  the  theoretical  argument  of  Calvo  and  Reinhart  (2002)  that  monetary  policy 
credibility  is  important  to  reduce  the  fear  of  floating,  the  present  study  empirically  analyzes 
whether monetary policy credibility is able to reduce the fear of floating of the Central Bank of 
Brazil (CBB). Besides, since one of the main goals of an Inflation Targeting (IT) central bank is 
to  guide  expectations,  we  also  check  whether  the  perception  of  financial  market  experts 
regarding the fear of floating of the CBB is affected by monetary policy credibility.  

The  study  contributes  to  the  literature  since  it  provides  evidence  that  the  exchange  rate 
affects  the  reaction  of  the  CBB  through  the  basic  interest  rate  and,  the  credibility  reduces  the 
effect  of  the  exchange  rate  on  the  reaction  of  the  CBB.  Following  the  literature  that  addresses 
monetary  policy  rules  (e.g.,  Clarida  et  al.  1998,  2000;  Berger  2008;  Moura  and  de  Carvalho 
2010;  Furlani, Portugal and  Laurini 2010;  Fendel  et  al. 2011; Frömmel  et  al. 2011), we use an 
expanded-Taylor rule. The rule considers standard elements of a Taylor-type rule (for instance, 
inflation deviations from the target and the output gap), as well as expectational variables (in line 
with  New  Keynesian  models)  and  the  effect  of  the  exchange  rate.1 As  a  novelty,  the  rule  also 
captures the effect of monetary policy credibility.2 Besides, another contribution is provided: we 
examine the expectations formed by the experts of the financial market in relation to the reaction 
of the CBB and, in particular, if monetary policy credibility affects these expectations.  

At  the  end  of  the  90s,  many  developing  countries  have  adopted  floating  exchange  rate 
regimes and IT. However, a feature that emerges when countries adopt this arrangement is that 
central banks in practice do not let the exchange rate float freely. This situation was highlighted 
by Calvo and Reinhart (2002), and called “fear of floating”. Once IT central bankers recognize 
the existence of the pass-through effect from exchange rate to domestic prices, they get worried 
about  the  possibility  that  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  could  threaten  the  IT  regime  (Ball  and 
Reyes 2008).  

Under  IT,  the  fear  of  floating  is  clearly  related  to  the  fear  of  inflation,  and  both  can  be 
justified  by  the  fear  of  the  monetary  authority  in  relation  to  the  pass-through  effect  from 
exchange  rate  devaluation  to  domestic  prices  (Ball  and  Reyes  2004,  2008).  However,  some 
studies have pointed to the existence of an inverse relationship between credibility and exchange 
rate pass-through, i.e., when credibility improves, it reduces the pass-through from exchange rate 
devaluation  to  inflation  (e.g.,  Taylor  2000;  Mishkin  and  Savastano  2001;  de  Mendonça  and 
Tostes 2015). Taylor (2000) suggests that the establishment of a strong nominal anchor in many 
countries  has  led  to  a  strong  reduction  in  the  degree  of  pass-through  from  exchange  rate 
devaluation  to  inflation.  Following  this  idea,  Mishkin  and  Savastano  (2001)  argue  that  the 
credibility gains from the monetary authority’s commitment to the IT regime may be responsible 
for  keeping  inflation  expectations  –  and  inflation  itself  –  anchored  to  the  established  inflation 
target, even after exchange rate devaluations.  

The concern of central banks with exchange rate fluctuations has been widely discussed in 
the  economic  literature.  Some  studies  have  emphasized  the  importance  of  considering  the 
exchange rate in monetary policy analysis (e.g., Ball 1999; Svensson 2000; Clarida et al. 2001; 
Calvo and Reinhart 2002; Ball and Reyes 2004, 2008; Lubik and Schorfheide 2007; Dong 2013). 
One of the main issues discussed in this literature was pointed out by Calvo and Reinhart (2002), 
which  showed  that  countries  adopting  floating  exchange  rate  regimes  and  IT  use  the  basic 
interest rate to avoid large fluctuations in the exchange rate.  

                                                           
1 According  to  Nogueira-Jr.  and  León-Ledesma  (2009),  the  greater  exchange  rate  pass-through  is,  the  greater  the 
response of the monetary policy to the exchange rate. They argue that “even if the Central Bank does not care about 
the exchange rate level, it must respond to its movements, as it influences the overall rate of inflation, and thus its 
ability to attain the inflation targets” (Nogueira-Jr. and León-Ledesma 2009, pp. 258). 
2 In order to obtain robust results, the analysis considers four different types of monetary policy credibility indexes. 
Moreover,  we  also  build  a  series  based  on  principal  component  approach  using  all  the  four  monetary  policy 
credibility indexes. 

According to Calvo and Reinhart (2002), one of the main reasons for the existence of fear 
of  floating  is  the  lack  of  credibility  of  the  monetary  authority.  The  authors  argue  that  many 
developing  countries  set  their  interest  rates  based  on  domestic  concerns,  and  the  decision  of 
smoothing  exchange  rate  variations  can  be  driven  by  a  scenario  of  low  credibility  with  a  high 
pass-through  effect.  Calvo  and  Reinhart  (2002)  show  that  the  movements  in  the  basic  interest 
rate  are  more  frequent  in  countries  with  floating  exchange  rate  regime.  The  theoretical  model 
proposed  by  them  consider  the  adoption  of  IT,  in  which  the  fear  of  floating  arises  from  a 
combination of high pass-through effect and low credibility. The results suggest it is not always 
easy  to  distinguish  whether  a  country  that  announces  the  adoption  of  IT  will  really  let  the 
exchange  rate  float  freely  or  not.  However,  the  work  of  Calvo  and  Reinhart  (2002)  does  not 
provide any empirical evidence regarding the effect of credibility on the fear of floating.  As far 
as we know, there is no study addressing the fear of floating which had empirically analyzed the 
effect of credibility on the fear of floating. Thus, to our knowledge, the present study contributes 
to the literature since it is the first one to empirically investigate this relation considering an IT 
developing country. 

Brazil  is  an  emerging  country  that  has  adopted  IT,  but  the  monetary  policy  is  also 
committed  to  smooth  exchange  rate  variations  (Ball  and  Reyes  2008).  Ball  and  Reyes  (2008) 
suggest  the  presence  of  fear  of  floating  in  the  conduction  of  monetary  policy  in  Brazil.  They 
argue that Brazilian policymakers announce that the country follows a regime of IT, but actually 
it follows a regime of fear of floating in disguise. 

Since  the  adoption  of  the  floating  exchange  rate  regime  and  IT  in  Brazil,  the  literature 
related  to  the  exchange  rate  pass-through  has  developed  more  vigorously  (e.g.,  Minella  et.  al 
2003;  Nogueira  Jr.  2007,  2010;  Ca’Zorzi  et  al.  2007;  de  Mendonça  and  Tostes  2015).  In 
particular,  de  Mendonça  and  Tostes  (2015)  points  out  that  high  fiscal  and  monetary  credibility 
can  reduce  the  pass-through  effect.  The  results  suggest  that,  while  monetary  credibility  is 
relevant  to  the  pass-through  related  to  the  inflation  of  market  prices,  fiscal  credibility  is 
important to reduce the pass-through related to inflation and inflation expectations.  

In  addition,  there  are  studies  that  have  examined  how  the  monetary  authority  behaves  in 
terms  of  monetary  policy  reaction.  Specifically,  some  studies  seek  to  verify  whether  the 
exchange  rate  affects  the  monetary  policy  reaction  function  of  the  CBB  (e.g.,  Bogdanski  et  al. 
2002;  Fraga  et  al.  2003;  Minella  et  al.  2003;  de  Mello  et.  al  2009;  Nogueira-Jr.  and  León-
Ledesma 2009; Palma and Portugal 2014). These studies are not conclusive about the existence 
of  fear  of  floating.  However,  they  point  out  that  the  CBB  smoothes  the  variations  in  the 
exchange rate in order to reduce the variability in the inflation rate (fear of inflation) (Nogueira-
Jr. and León-Ledesma 2009). 

Brazil  is  an  interesting  case  study  on  this  subject  because  since  1999  it  adopts  inflation 
targeting  with  a  floating  exchange  rate  regime.  However,  as  pointed  out  by  Ball  and  Reyes 
(2008), the monetary authority faces the dilemma of leaving the exchange rate fluctuates without 
intervention.  

Following Calvo and Reinhart (2002), our argument is that this dilemma is clearly related 
to  the  construction  of  credibility  and  the  reduction  of  exchange  rate  volatility,  which  are 
important  challenges  to  be  overcome  by  policymakers  in  Brazil.  Particularly  in  relation  to  the 
importance  of  credibility,  when  monetary  policy  credibility  is  low,  inflation  increases  and 
departs from the established inflation target (Montes and Curi 2016; Montes and Bastos 2014). 
As a consequence, an environment of low credibility leads the central bank to fear exchange rate 
devaluations, because such devaluations can increase the inflation rate through the pass-through 
effect. Thus, with low monetary policy credibility, the monetary authority is more susceptible to 
react to movements in the exchange rate, rather than simply pursuing the inflation target and let 
the currency float freely. 

The findings suggest monetary policy credibility is able to reduce the fear of the monetary 
authority in  relation  to  exchange rate fluctuations in  Brazil. Besides, the estimates also  suggest 
that  the  improvement  of  monetary  policy  credibility  is  important  to  reduce  the  expectations 

formed by the forecasters of the financial market about the fear of floating of the CBB. From the 
results obtained policymakers should pay attention to the credibility of their policies, otherwise 
they  may  be  misinterpreted  in  relation  to  the  goals  they  pursue  and  how  they  conduct  their 
policies. 

 

2. Empirical evidence 
 

Our study contributes to the literature once it seeks empirical evidence for the theoretical 
hypothesis  suggested  by  Calvo  and  Reinhart  (2002)  that  the  development  of  credibility  is 
important to reduce the fear of floating. Besides, the paper also contributes to the literature once 
we advance in relation to the studies presented by Nogueira-Jr. and León-Ledesma (2009) and de 
Mendonça and Tostes (2015) for the Brazilian economy.  

Nogueira-Jr.  and  León-Ledesma  (2009)  empirically  evaluates  the  impact  of  a  radical 
monetary  policy  regime  shift  in  an  emerging  market.  They  ask  if  this  regime  shift  produced  a 
change in the exchange rate policy. The authors provide evidence on exchange rate pass-through 
for Brazil between 1995 and 2007, as well as the reaction of monetary policy to exchange rate 
shocks,  comparing  the  period  before  and  after  the  adoption  of  IT  in  1999.  They  suggest  three 
main conclusions regarding fear of  floating in Brazil:  (i) exchange rate pass-through decreased 
dramatically  after  the  adoption  of  IT;  (ii)  although  exchange  rate  variability  increased 
substantially after IT, the CBB kept on reacting to exchange rate changes, and; (iii) the reaction 
of the CBB to exchange rate shocks shifted almost completely from using international reserves 
to  using  interest  rates  as  monetary  policy  instrument.  According  to  Nogueira-Jr.  and  León-
Ledesma  (2009),  in  relation  to  Brazil,  monetary  policy  interventions  through  the  basic  interest 
rate can be interpreted more as “Fear of Inflation” than “Fear of Floating”. That is, interest rates 
reactions to the exchange rate simply reflect the fact that the CBB reacts to anything that affects 
inflation. 

In  turn,  de  Mendonça  and  Tostes  (2015)  present  empirical  evidence  regarding  the 
exchange rate pass-through effect on inflation in Brazil after the adoption of IT. In general, the 
results indicate that the pass-through effect is important in explaining the inflation rate. Besides, 
they analyze the impact of fiscal and monetary credibility in the transmission mechanism of the 
pass-through  from  exchange  rate  to  inflation.  The  empirical  evidence  indicates  high  credibility 
helps  to  mitigate  the  exchange  rate  pass-through  effect.  Thus,  one  might  think  that  a 
consequence of this is a better control on inflation with lower social cost. 
 
2.1 Data 

 

The data used to  build the series were obtained  from  the CBB.  Due to  the availability of 
data, the period of analysis runs from July 2002 to December 2015 (monthly).  The analysis uses 
the  following  series:  basic  interest  rate  (SELIC),  expectation  for  the  basic  interest  rate  for  the 
next  12  months  (E(SELIC)),  inflation  rate  measured  by  the  official  Consumer  Price  Index  – 
IPCA – (INF), expectation for the inflation rate measured by the official Consumer Price Index – 
IPCA – for the next  12 months (E(INF)), real  interest  rate (SELIC_R), expectation  for the real 
interest  rate for the next  12 months (E(SELIC_R)), exchange rate (EXCH), expectation for the 
exchange rate for the next 12 months (E(ECXH)), inflation deviations in relation to the inflation 
target  (DESV_INF),  expected 
target 
(DESV_EINF), output gap (GAP),  expected output deviations in  relation to  its trend (E(GAP)) 
(Table  A1  in  the  Appendix  presents  a  detailed  description  of  the  series).  All  the  series  are 
transformed to consider the cumulative change in the last twelve months. Furthermore, a dummy 
variable  (CRISIS)  for  the  subprime  financial  crisis  and  its  international  consequences  is  also 
used (it assumes value 1 from September 2008 to December 2012, and zero otherwise).

In  order  to  capture  monetary  policy  credibility,  we  use  four  different  credibility  indexes. 
All  the  indexes  are  based  on  the  idea  of  Agénor  and  Taylor  (1992)  that  series  of  expected 

inflation  could  be  applied  to  derive  a  credibility  index.  As  Svensson  (2000)  proposed,  the 
credibility can be measured by the difference between expected inflation and the target. Hence, 
we use the following indexes: the first one comes from Cecchetti and Krause (2002); the second 
comes  from  de  Mendonça  (2007);  the  third  was  proposed  by  de  Guimarães  e  Souza  and  de 
Mendonça (2009), and; the fourth comes from Tejada, Neto and Leal (2013). 

The index proposed by Cecchetti and Krause Index (2002) (CREDCK) is calculated based 
on the difference between the expected inflation (    ) and the inflation target (  ). The index 
is  equal  to  1  if  the  annual  expected  inflation  (    )  is  below  the  inflation  target  (  ).  If  the 
inflation  expectations  are  lower  than  20%  but  higher  than  the  target,  the  index  value  ranges 
between 0 and 1. If the expected inflation is equal or higher than 20%, the index is 0. The index 
uses the series of inflation expectations obtained from the CBB and the inflation target defined 
by the monetary authority. Hence: 
 

 
                                                                                                                       
              
   

                                                           

            

 

   

          

      

                                                                                                                   

 

 

In turn, the index proposed by de Mendonça (2007) has a value equal to 1 when the annual 
expected  inflation  (    )  is  equal  to  the  target  (    )  and  decreases  in  a  linear  way  while 
inflationary  expectation  deviates  from  the  announced  target.  Therefore,  the  credibility  index 
shows a value between 0 and 1 strictly if the expected inflation is situated between the maximum 
and  minimum  limits  (  )  established  for  each  year  and  assumes  a  value  equal  to  0  when  the 
expected inflation exceeds one of these limits. Since the idea of the index is to capture the degree 
of anchorage in a normalized index (between 0 and 1), so when the expected inflation is above 
the inflation target (and at the same time it did not exceed the upper limit of the band), we use, in 
) and the inflation target (  ). 
the denominator, the difference between the maximum limit (     
But, when the inflation expectation is below the inflation target (and at the same time it did not 
exceed  the  lower  limit  of  the  band),  we  use,  in  the  denominator,  the  difference  between  the 
)  and  the  inflation  target  (    ).  The  index  uses  inflation  expectations 
minimum  limit  (      
obtained from the CBB, and the inflation target and the tolerance bands defined by the monetary 
authority. 
 

 

 

 
                                                                                                                       
              
   
                  

                                                     
                                                                                

            

 
    
  

 

 

 

 

   

         

 

Based  on  the  index  of  Cecchetti  and  Krause  (2002),  de  Guimarães  e  Souza  and  de 
Mendonça  (2009)  proposed  an  index.  The  idea  of  the  index  is  that  when  the  annual  expected 
inflation (    ) exceeds any of the tolerance bands (     
) but it does not cross the lower 
limit  of  0%  nor  the  higher  limit  of  20%,  there  is  a  linear  loss  of  credibility.  If  the  expected 
inflation (    ) is lower than 0% or higher than 20% there is 0 credibility. The index is equal to 
1 if the expected inflation (    ) is within the tolerance bands.  Thus:

Regarding  the  index  proposed  by  Tejada,  Neto  and  Leal  (2013),  its  main  feature  is  to 
consider  non-linearities,  so  that  small  deviations  from  the  inflation  target  represent  a  smaller 

credibility reduction. On the other hand, large deviations from  the target  have a stronger effect 
on  credibility.  The  idea  is  that  small  deviations  can  be  perceived  as  temporary,  and  as  a 
consequence they do not harm credibility as much as large deviations. Its quadratic specification 
captures  this  nonlinear  effect.  Again,  the  index  uses  inflation  expectations  obtained  from  the 
CBB,  and  the  inflation  target  and  the  tolerance  bands  defined  by  the  monetary  authority. 
Therefore:

combination  of  the  indexes,  i.e.,  we  build  a  series  based  on  the  first  principal  component 
approach using all the monetary policy credibility indexes (PC_CREDM).  

A  first  condition  to  be  analyzed  before  applying  the  econometric  analysis  is  to  check  if 
series  are  stationary  (or  have  unit  roots).  Therefore,  the  Augmented  Dickey-Fuller  (ADF), 
Phillips-Perron (PP) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests were applied (Table 2 
below).  The  results  showed  that  all  series  are  I(0)  (an  expected  result,  once  all  the  series  are 
transformed to  consider the cumulative change in  the last twelve months). Since the credibility 
indexes  are  variables  with  values  between  0  and  1,  unit  root  tests  are  not  necessary,  i.e.,  all 
credibility indexes are stationary.

2.2 Methodology 

 

 
Aiming  at  verifying  the  theoretical  argument  of  Calvo  and  Reinhart  (2002),  i.e.,  whether 
credibility reduces the fear of floating, we use an expanded-Taylor rule. In general, a Taylor rule 
is used in the literature to show how a central bank reacts to changes in macroeconomic variables 
(Taylor 1993). In order to avoid criticisms related to the use of a single functional form, and in 
order  to  give  robustness  to  the  results,  we  use  different  forms  of  the  Taylor  rule  which  are 
obtained  from  the  theoretical  and  empirical  literature  (e.g.,  Clarida  et  al  1998;  Minella  et  al. 
2003;  Lubik  2007).  In  all  specifications,  we  use  the  standard  variables  of  the  Taylor  rule  (the 
deviation  of  inflation  from  the  target  and  the  output  gap),  as  well  as  expectations  about 
macroeconomic variables (i.e., EINF and EGAP), which captures the forward-looking behavior 
of the Central Bank. Besides, all specifications present the influence of the exchange rate on the 
reaction of the CBB through the basic interest rate.  

In turn, aiming at checking the effect of monetary policy credibility on the fear of floating, 
we use interaction terms, such as de Mendonça and Tostes (2015). However, while de Mendonça 
and Tostes (2015) analyzed the influence of fiscal and monetary credibility on the pass-through 
from  exchange  rate  to  inflation  considering  the  effect  of  the  interaction  between  the  exchange 
rate and the credibility indexes, we use these interactions in the CBB’s reaction function. 

We  use  two  sets  of  empirical  equations  considering  the  variables  exchange  rate  and 
monetary  policy  credibility  in  level:  one  with  the  nominal  interest  rate  in  the  right  hand  side 
(RHS)  (equations  1,  2,  3  4,  5  and  6)  and  the  other  with  the  real  interest  rate  in  the  RHS 
(equations  7,  8,  9,  10,  11  and  12).  We  estimate  both  sets  of  equations  obtained  from  the 
empirical literature in order to verify if the results remain the same for different functional forms.

from 1 to 12 using the first difference for the variables of monetary policy credibility (∆    ), 
as  well  as  the  first  difference  for  the  exchange  rate  (∆EXCH).  While  the  analysis  with  the 
variables  in  level  shows  how  the  interest  rate  is  affected,  depending  on  the  level  of  credibility 
and the level of exchange rate; on the other hand, the estimations considering the first differences 
show how the variation of credibility affects the CBB reaction due to variations of the exchange 
rate.  Once  again,  the  rationale  for  the  use  of  this  procedure  is  to  anticipate  a  possible  question 
that  can  be  raised,  this  time  related  to  the  idea  that  it  is  also  important  to  check  the  effect  of 
changes  in  the  exchange  rate  and  changes  in  the  monetary  policy  credibility  (such  as  de 
Mendonça  and  Tostes  (2015)  have  done  for  the  pass-through  effect  from  exchange  rate  to 
inflation).

Where,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,   ,   ,  ,  ,  ,   e   are random  error terms. Regarding the specifications, 
the lags were determined on an empirical basis, following the general-to-specific method, and on 
the  principle  of  parsimony.  This  methodology  takes  into  consideration  not  only  the  statistical 

                                                           
3 In the case of equations using the variables in first differences, the variables ∆     and ∆EXCH are inserted in 
the places of these variables expressed in level. Thus, for instance, equation (2) becomes: 
                                                                                             

                                              

significance of the parameters, but also diagnostic tests, in order to ensure that the chosen model 
has explanatory power and thus guarantees a parsimonious equation (Hendry, 2001). 

It  is  worth  noting  that  the  terms  CRED  or         (where  CRED  is          
                       or        ) make the coefficient of the exchange rate effect on 
the reaction of the CBB dependent on credibility. The total exchange rate effect coefficients are 
given  by:    +    (Eq.  2),     +     (Eq.  3)           (Eq.  4)          (Eq.  5),            (Eq.  6), 
          (Eq.  8),         (Eq.  9),         (Eq.  10)        +    (Eq.  11),  and    +    (Eq.  12). 
While the coefficients for the exchange rate term are expected to be positive (  ,   ,       ,   , 
  ,   ,   ,     ,  and    >  0),  on  the  other  hand,  for  the  interaction  term,  a  negative  signal  is 
expected (  ,   ,       ,   ,   ,   ,   ,    , and    < 0). In this sense, when credibility is at high 
levels, the monetary authority reacts with less intensity to the exchange rate. In turn, if credibility 
is  low,  the  monetary  authority  presents  a  stronger  reaction  to  the  exchange  rate.  The  same 
argument can be used if we consider the specifications with ∆     and ∆EXCH. When there is 
an improvement in  credibility ∆     > 0, the CCB reacts  with  less intensity to exchange  rate 
variations. 

The  analysis  makes  use  of  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  and  the  generalized  method  of 
moments  (GMM).  One  reason  for  using  GMM  is  that  while  OLS  estimates  have  problems  of 
simultaneity  and endogeneity of the regressors,  which is  typical  in  macroeconomic time series, 
GMM  provides  consistent  estimations  (Hansen  1982).  The  GMM  estimates  adopted  a  standard 
procedure based on Johnston (1984), i.e., the chosen instruments were dated to the period t-1 or 
earlier.  Cragg  (1983)  argues  that  overidentification  has  an  important  role  in  the  selection  of 
instrumental variables to improve the efficiency of the estimators. Hence,  a standard J-test was 
performed  with  the  objective  of  testing  this  property  for  the  validity  of  the  overidentifying 
restrictions,  i.e.,  the  J-statistic  indicates  whether  the  orthogonality  condition  is  satisfied. 
Moreover,  regarding  all  GMM  estimations,  we  present  the  Durbin–Wu–Hausman  test  (D-W-H 
test) of the endogeneity of regressors (Durbin 1954; Wu 1973; Hausman 1978). 

In  order  to  give  robustness  to  the  results  and  to  avoid  possible  criticisms  regarding  the 
choices  of  the  lags  in  the  regressions,  we  estimate  through  GMM  all  the  equations  previously 
described using contemporary regressors. In this case, estimates through OLS are not made due 
to the problems of simultaneity and endogeneity that arise when using contemporary regressors, 
which justify the use of GMM.  

 

2.3 – Estimates and results 

 
Tables 3 and 4 show the estimates through OLS and GMM, respectively, for equations (1) 
to  (12),  using  both  variables  CRED  and  EXCH  in  level.  Tables  5  and  6  present  the  estimates 
through  OLS  and  GMM,  respectively,  for  the  same  equations,  but  using  the  variables  ∆     
and ∆EXCH, instead of the variables in level.  

The results reported in tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 reveal that all estimated coefficients present the 
expected  signs  and  are  in  agreement  with  the  theoretical  perspective.  Regarding  the  estimated 
coefficients  of  the  variables  traditionally  analyzed  in  empirical  studies  using  Taylor  rules,  the 
findings  corroborate  the  results  already  reported  in  the  literature  and  suggest,  with  statistical 
significance:  (i)  the  existence  of  a  positive  relationship  between  the  inflation  rate  and  the 
reaction  of  the  CBB  through  the  basic  interest  rate,  (ii)  the  existence  of  a  positive  relationship 
between  the  deviation  of  inflation  from  the  target  and  the  reaction  of  the  CBB,  and  (iii)  the 
existence  of  a  positive  relationship  between  the  output  gap  and  the  reaction  of  the  CBB. 
Moreover, the findings suggest the CBB reacted to the international financial crisis. 

Besides,  the  results  also  suggest  that  the  CBB  acts  in  a  forward-looking  way.  Estimates 
reveal positive coefficients for the reaction of the CBB in relation to inflation expectations and 
also in relation to expectations for economic activity. 

Regarding  the  relationship  between  the  exchange  rate  and  the  reaction  of  the  CBB,  all 
estimated  coefficients  are  positive  and  statistical  significance  was  found  in  most  of  the 

coefficients. The estimated coefficients for the variable ∆EXCH obtained through OLS were the 
exception since none of them presented statistical significance. However, when obtained through 
GMM,  all  estimated  coefficients  for  the  variable  ∆EXCH  present  the  expected  signs  and 
statistical  significance.  Thus,  the  results  indicate the  CBB  reacts  through  the  basic  interest  rate 
and suggests the existence of a behavior compatible with the notion of fear of floating. 

With respect to the hypothesis  that monetary policy  credibility  is  important  to  reduce the 
fear of floating, the results presented in tables 3 and 4, based on the estimates of equations (2) to 
(6) and (8) to (12), show the higher the credibility, the lower the reaction of the CBB in relation 
to  the  exchange  rate.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  estimated  coefficients  for  the  interactive 
variables formed by the exchange rate and the different monetary policy credibility indexes are 
negative in all equations and statistically significant in most of them.  

Besides,  due  to  the  fact  that  the  fear  of  floating  is  directly  related  to  exchange  rate 
fluctuations,  we  estimate  the  same  equations  with  the  first  difference  of  the  exchange  rate  and 
the first difference of the monetary policy credibility indexes. Tables 5 and 6 show the estimates 
through OLS and GMM, respectively. Again, all estimated coefficients have the expected signs 
and  corroborate  the  theoretical  view.  The  results  are  similar  to  those  in  Tables  3  and  4  that 
consider  the  equations  with  the  exchange  rate  and  the  types  of  monetary  policy  credibility 
indexes  in  level.  The  results  reinforce  the  idea  that  credibility  is  able  to  reduce  the  fear  of 
floating, because if there is an improvement in credibility, the CBB becomes less susceptible to 
react to exchange rate pressures.  

With  relation  to  the  estimates  through  GMM  for  all  the  equations  using  contemporary 
regressors,  the  results  corroborate  the  findings  already  reported  above.  4  In  particular,  the 
estimates strengthen the idea that the improvement of monetary policy credibility can reduce the 
fear of floating.

Estimates for the expectations related to the fear of floating 

 
Due to the fact that expectations play a key role in countries adopting IT, monetary policy 
credibility  can  serve  as  an  important  mechanism  for  reducing  the  expected  effects  of  the 
exchange rate on the expected reaction of the CBB through the basic interest rate. One can argue 
that  in  an  environment  with  high  credibility,  agents  expect  a  smoother  reaction  of  the  CBB  in 
relation  to  the  exchange  rate.  Hence,  representing  a  novelty  (and  thus  a  contribution)  to  the 
literature  related  to  fear  of  floating,  another  issue  examined  in  the  present  study  concerns  the 
perception  of  the  experts  of  the  financial  market  about  the  fear  of  floating.  Therefore,  we 
estimate the following equations:

(16) 

                                                                                   
                                                                              

(17) 

                                                                                   
                                                                                 (18) 
 
where,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and   are  random  error  terms.  The  lags  were  determined  on  an  empirical 
basis, following the general-to-specific method, and on the principle of parsimony. 

Besides, we also estimate all the equations from 13 to 18 using the first difference for the 
variables of monetary policy credibility (∆    ), as well as the first difference for the exchange 
rate (∆EXP_EXCH). 

Once  again,  the  analysis  makes  use  of  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  and  the  generalized 
method  of  moments  (GMM).  Aiming  at  giving  robustness  to  the  results  and  to  avoid  possible 
criticisms regarding the choices of the lags in the regressions, we estimate through GMM all the 
equations from 13 to 18 using contemporary regressors. In this case, estimates through OLS are 
not  made  due  to  the  problems  of  simultaneity  and  endogeneity  that  arise  when  using 
contemporary regressors, which justify the use of GMM.  

Table  7  presents  OLS  and  GMM  estimates  for  equations  (13)  to  (18).  The  estimates  are 
consistent with the results previously presented. The evidence shows that when inflation deviates 
from  the inflation target and inflation expectations increase, the experts of the financial market 
expect the CBB will raise the basic rate interest. The estimates also reveal positive coefficients in 
relation to expectations for economic activity (EGAP) and for the output gap (GAP). Moreover, 
the  findings  indicate  a  positive  relation  between  EXP_EXCH  and  EXP_SELIC,  i.  e.,  when  the 
experts  of  the  financial  market  expect  a  higher  exchange  rate  they  also  expect  the  CBB  will 
increase  the  basic  interest  rate.  Regarding  the  effects  of  monetary  policy  credibility  on  the 
perception of the experts of the financial market about the fear of floating, the results show that 
they  perceive  a  reduction  in  the  fear  of  floating  when  credibility  is  enhanced.  In  addition,  the 
results  for  the  estimates  using  contemporary  regressors  (table  A.4  in  the  Appendix)  are 
consistent with the findings presented in table 7. 

Table  8,  in  turn,  presents  the  estimates  of  equations  (13)  to  (18),  however  with  the 
variation  of  the  exchange  rate  (∆EXCH)  and  the  variation  of  the  different  monetary  policy 

credibility indexes. The results for the control variables corroborate the theoretical view as well 
as  the  findings  presented  in  Table  8.  In  turn,  the  findings  reveal  that  when  the  experts  of  the 
financial  market  expect  a  higher  positive  exchange  rate  variation  they  expect  the  CBB  will 
increase the basic interest rate. In relation to the effects of monetary policy credibility variations 
on the perception of the experts of the financial market about the fear of floating, once again the 
results show that they perceive  a reduction in the fear of floating when credibility is enhanced. 
Moreover, the results for the estimates using contemporary regressors, but with the variation of 
the  exchange  rate  (∆EXCH)  and  the  variation  of  the  different  monetary  policy  credibility 
indexes, are consistent with the findings presented in table 8.5

3. Conclusions 

 

Based  on  the  theoretical  argument  of  Calvo  and  Reinhart  (2002)  that  monetary  policy 
credibility is important to reduce the fear of floating, we empirically analyzed this hypothesis 
for the Brazilian case. Since Brazil is an IT developing country, expectations play a key role. 
In this sense, we go further and suggest that monetary  policy credibility  is also important to 
affect the expectations of the experts of the financial market about the fear of floating of the 
Central  Bank.  Thus,  besides  Calvo  and  Reinhart’s  hypothesis,  we  also  empirically  analyzed 
whether  monetary  policy  credibility  affects  the  perception  of  the  experts  of  the  financial 
market  about  the  fear  of  floating.  The  main  contributions  of  the  paper  are  twofold:  First,  to 
our knowledge, the paper is the first to empirically analyze Calvo and Reinhart’s theoretical 
argument, and; second, the paper is the first to propose and to empirically analyze the effect 
of  monetary  policy  credibility  on  the  perception  of  the  forecasters  of  the  financial  market 
about the fear of floating.  

For  this,  we  made  use  of  different  functional  forms  of  the  Taylor  rule  as  well  as 
different  credibility  indexes.  Based  on  the  estimates,  we  provide  empirical  evidence  that 
monetary  policy  credibility  is  important  to  reduce  the  fear  of  the  monetary  authority  in 
relation  to  exchange  rate  fluctuations,  i.e.,  the  findings  corroborate  Calvo  and  Reinhart’s 
theoretical  argument.  Furthermore,  the  estimates  also  suggest  that  the  improvement  of 
monetary policy credibility is important to reduce the expectations formed by the forecasters 
of the financial market about the fear of floating of the CBB.
