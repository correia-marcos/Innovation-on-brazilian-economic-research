ABSTRACT 

This paper aims to contribute to the literature on the intellectual history of the economics discipline 
in  Brazil  and  its  place  within  the  network  of  international  transmission  of  economic  ideas,  by 
delving  into  the  history  of  the  Kaldor-Pazos-Simonsen  mechanism,  namely:  the  behavior  of 
periodically-adjusted  fixed  nominal  wages  under  persistent  inflationary  conditions  (the  sawtooth 
wages model). Ranging from the immediate post-War years to the end of the 1960s, our narrative 
reveals  that  prior  to  Nicholas  Kaldor’s  statement  of  the  sawtooth  model  of  real  wages,  other 
contributions sprung from various traditions. To this effect, we underline the discoursive appraisal 
by Celso Furtado (1954) and the early neoclassical model by Bent Hansen (1951), only to fit both 
of  them  in  a  broader  historical  context  of  the  economics  discipline,  whereby  the  emergence  of 
formal  mathematical  methods  allows  for  the  connection  between  this  debate  and  the  Operations 
Research Program in the North-American universities in the early 1950s.

Este artigo busca contribuir com a literatura de história da ciência econômica no Brazil e seu lugar 
na rede internacional de transmissão das ideias econônomicas, por meio de uma análise da história 
do mecanismo Kaldor-Pazos-Simonsen, qual seja: o comportamento de rendas nominais fixas com 
reajustamento periódico sob inflação crônica (ou modelo “dente-de-serra”). Nossa narrativa cobre o 
período do imediato pós-Guerra até fins da década de 1960, revelando contribuições que antecedem 
àquela  de  Nicholas  Kaldor,  tais  como  a  abordagem  discursiva  de  Furtado  (1954)  e  o  modelo 
neoclássico  de  Hansen  (1951),  enquadrando-as  no  contexto  mais  amplo  da  história  da  ciência 
econômica, em que a crescente adoção de métodos formais matemáticos permite a conexão entre 
esse debate e o programa de Pesquisa Operacional desenvolvidos na academia norte-americano no 
início da década de 1950.

Introduction 

	  

This  work  aims  to  contribute  to  the  wider  body  of  research  in  the  intellectual  history  of  the 
economics  discipline  in  Brazil  and  its  place  within  the  network  of  international  transmission  of 
economic ideas. It attempts to understand one aspect of the evolving economics discipline, to which 
Brazilian  economists  have  given  a  modest  -  albeit  innovative  –  contribution,  namely:  the 
understanding  of  real  wages  under  persistent  inflationary  conditions  (the  sawtooth  model),  one 
which has been overlooked in the literature on the history of economic ideas. The timespan of our 
speculations ranges from the immediate post-War years to the end of the 1960s. 
 
To  the  Latin  American  audience,  the  theoretical  framing  of  this  particular  regularity  was 
conveyed  in  the  “inflation  feedback  model”,  which  was  developed  indenpendently  by  Mario 
Henrique  Simonsen  (1964,  1970)  and  by  Felipe  Pazos  (1963,  1969,  1972).  The  model  is  an 
ingeniously  simple  way  of  portraying  an  economy  with  a  persistently  high  inflation  trend.  The 
coupling together of inflation-correcting schemes, such as index-linking of contracts and prices, and 
a gradual approach to anti-inflation measures, sponsored by governments in Latin America, give 
nominal contractual incomes a visual pattern with a resemblance to a “saw-tooth”. Vera (2013) has 
found that Kaldor’s (1957c, 1957d) contributions to the stabilization debates in the 1950s involved 
this  early  representation  of  the  pattern,  thus  claimed  priority  of  Kaldor’s  take  over  those  by 
Simonsen (1964) and Pazos (1963).  
 
Expanding on Vera´s paper, we find that not only had Furtado (1954) previously described 
the exact same phenomenon – albeit arguably drawing on a different tradition of economics -, but a 
similar portrait was put forth by Bent Hansen’s (1951) study of inflation theories. Harking further 
back to the past, we are able to connect this sawtooth-shaped diagram to the emerging Operations 
Research  (OR)  program,  where  mechanical  models  of  inventory  management  held  striking 
similarities to the visual representations of real incomes under sustained inflationary conditions. We 
claim  that  Kaldor’s  input  to  this  debate  reflected  a  broader  intellectual  backdrop,  in  which  the 
appearance  of  the  first  saw-tooth-shaped  patterns  reflected  the  rise  of  the  mechanical  models  in 
economics, amongst which those pertaining to inflation. By doing so, we take a first step towards 
building a historical reconstruction of the sawtooth-shaped diagram, a visual representation of the 
self-replicating pattern of inflation, so widely known in Latin America in the 1980s. 
Following this introduction, first section presents a brief overview of the postwar “eclipse of 
 
the goal of zero inflation” which sets out the backdrop to the recurrent erosion of purchasing power 
of  fixed  nominal  incomes  within  periods  of  adjustment  modeled  thereafter.  Section  2  tracks  the 
anticipation of the seminal graphical representation by Nicholas Kaldor in the discursive appraisal 
offered by Celso Furtado, followed by Hansen’s institutions-laden neoclassical model of inflation 
(section 3) and, in section 4, by our working hypothesis that the OR program offered an analogous 
visual tool borrowed by economists to account for economic phenomena. Last section concludes.

1.  Creeping inflation and the eclipse of the goal of zero inflation3 

Economists  in  the  postwar  period  have  singled  out  the  existence  of  an  inflationary  bias  to 
economies,  both  developed  and  underdeveloped.4  There  are  many  perceptions  and  opinions 
regarding the underlying causes of this extensive upward bias in price level historical data in the 
postwar period. Is such a tendency a “natural” property of the capitalist system or is it simply bad 
government running bad policies? Or yet, is it a tolerable outcome or a morally reproachable evil? It 
is  the  profession´s  general  change  of  mind  and  heart  regarding  this  question  that  this  chapter  is 
about. How did this inflationary bias come to be accepted within the economics profession? In what 
follows,  we  will  paint  with  a  rather  broad  brush  this  changing  significance  of  inflation  both  in 
academic undertakings and in devising macroeconomic policy priorities. 

As early as 1936, Keynes ([1936] 1964, p. 307] had already depicted an inflationary bias in 
economic trends, which owed much to the endogeneity of the money supply to the structural and 
institutional forces responsible for growth and innovation. Following the end of the World War II, 
Leeson (1997) has identified a gradual eclipse of the goal of zero inflation, as “employment” rose to 
the status of a primary policy goal, relegating “price stability” to a second tier. Between 1953 and 
1959, the fact that inflation had become persistent in industrial countries reinforced this view. In 
turn, this prompted a reaction to these inflation-tolerant views during President Eisenhower’s term, 
when economists at the Joint Economic Committee recommended price stability be restored as the 
federal  government’s  primary  policy  aim,  preferring  high  unemployment  (a  6%  rate  seemed 
compatible with stability) to the unquestionable inflationary pressures. It was commonly held that 
creeping  inflation  (of  2-3%  annual  rate)  would  harm  economic  performance  and  would  almost 
naturally degenerate into hyperinflation.5 

                                                 
3 This section follows closely the approach set out by Leeson (1997) and Reddaway (1997). 
4 In a discussion promoted in the year 1949 by the Review of Economics and Statistics, Seymour Harris (1949, p. 200) 
opened  up  his  contribution  to  the  series  with  the  following  statement:  “Inflation  is  a  worldwide  phenomenon:  in 
countries ravaged by war, and in those largely untouched; in countries blessed (?) by overemployment and in those 
suffering from unemployment; in countries favored by an excess of imports and those ‘injured by an excess of exports; 
in countries with budgetary surpluses and those with large deficits; in countries largely tethered to the principles of free 
enterprise and those relying on the planned economy and controls”. In his turn, William Brian Reddaway (1997, p. 32-
33)  dwelled  with  the  more  than  apparent  changing  significance  of  the  inflationary  phenomenon  in  this  period.  He 
supports this claim with some simple empirical evidence on a handful of developed countries, in which the consumer 
price index have at least doubled in each one of them between 1962 and 1992 - Germany had a 184% increase, whereas 
Italy faced a 1300% increase. 
5  For  more  details,  see  Leeson  (1997,  p.  454-456).  In  addition,  subscribing  to  with  this  view,  James  Tobin  (a  key 
character in our narrative) was also a particularly notorious campaigning academic for the employment-bias within the 
Phillips curve trade-off, that an economy could live with inflation, but could hardly afford stagnation (Tobin & Ross 
1971,  p.  24).  In  Brazil,  the  notorious  economist  Eugênio  Gudin  (1965,  p.  166)  exposed  some  concerns  over  state-
regulated prices and the ensuing downward rigidity they impose on the price level, thus engendering a systematically 
observed “gentle rise in the price level”. Gudin refered to Sumner Slichter, a famous Harvard professor at that time for 
his  defense  of  the  maintenance5  of  a  “creeping  inflation”  –  ranging  around  a  2%  constant  yearly  rate  -  directed  at 
mitigating the harmful effects of union pressure for higher wages, usually above the rate allowed by the increases in 
productivity. Yet, Gudin claimed that there was no “automatic force acting in favor of the restoration of equilibrium”, 
once  the  inflationary  process  is  triggered.  According  to  his  view,  once  it  starts,  the  process  tends  to  expand 
automatically, following a cumulative process à la Wicksell. As such, “in an inflationary regime, output production can 
only  resume,  at  the  same  level,  if  the  available  amount  of  credits  rise  progressively”,  which  implies  logically  and 
immediately the setting of an escalating price-wage-price spiral (Gudin 1965, p. 183). 

3 

 

	  

Moreover, this general stand was not confined to the United States. Kaldor’s memorandum 
to the Radcliffe Committee in the UK contained a section entitled “The Dangers of a Regime of 
Stable  Prices”,  in  which  he  claimed  that  the  low  dynamism  of  the  British  economy  should  be 
countered  by  “doping”  the  economy  with  inflation.  He  also  ascribed  to  “value-judgements  and 
social preferences” the priority conferred to price stability or economic growth, and stated that “I 
would regard the sort of inflation we have been having, of the order of 3 to 4 percent a year, as a 
considerably  lesser  evil  than  economic  stagnation  or  mass  unemployment  or  instability  in 
production”; in fact, he would sustain, “if we want to escape from economic stagnation, we must 
reconcile ourselves to rising prices” (Radcliffe et al. 1960, 715-17 quoted in Leeson, 1997, p. 455, 
n. 11). 

The  eclipse  of  the  zero-inflation  goal  did  not  imply  the  complete  withdrawal  of  inflation 
concerns from the policy agenda, although it was clearly relegated to a secondary position. Two 
points should have become quite clear by now: inflation was in the postwar years an empirically 
observable reality and economists, in general, have found it better to find ways to live with it than to 
unbendingly and unswervingly keep it from happening on pain of higher unemployment and lower 
growth rates. The end result of was the transformation of the concept of price stability from nil to a 
non-zero positive rate.6  

In  this  context,  questions  addressing  the  distributional  effects  were  bound  to  arise.  In  the 
absence of any credible indication that prices will stop rising, economic agents set out to find ways 
protect the purchasing power of their incomes and the real value of their asset holdings. Once the 
ongoing inflation seems not to be going away, mechanisms are designed to cope with it. Sliding 
scales, escalator clauses, index-linked bonds and assets, indexation, monetary correction were all 
byproducts of the slow process of degeneration of unit-of-account property of money. Under the 
influence of such institutional adaptations, actual real world prices and wages are likely to behave 
quite mechanically (Heymann & Leijonhufvud 1995, p. 34); as history had it, so did the models that 
explained them. 7 

                                                 
6 The creeping inflation that lasted a quarter of a century past the World War II prompted a change of feelings within 
the profession against the ongoing policy regime. Moderate commentators claimed, by 1971, that inflation was being 
greatly exaggerated as a menace (see, for instance, Tobin & Ross 1971). Soon, however, the price hikes in the first half 
of the decade would challenge such stands. The balance of perceptions began to tilt towards the monetarist side of the 
controversy.  Even  some  sympathetic  to  Keynesian  claims  laid  stress  on  the  costs  in  terms  of  monetary  authority’s 
credibility of seeking “the mirage” of a steady inflation, that is, a “target of stability in the first derivative of the value of 
the dollar rather than in its level” (see Okun 1973 and 1975). Furthermore, developed countries were then said to be 
undergoing a chronic inflationary problem (Okun & Perry 1978). To drive the point home, Leeson (1997, p. 482-483) 
reminds us that, in the 1960s, many warnings in this regard were issued in rather gloomy images; for instance, the view 
that a “Faustian pact” with the “inflation dragon” would engender the “Latin Americanisation of the world”, whereby a 
“cost inflation at a high rate has produced a ‘general crisis of capitalism’ and the stability of Communist prices shines 
like a good deed in a naughty world; yet economic theory has nothing to say”. In academia, Paul Samuelson echoed this 
altered sentiment toward inflation, concluding in the first edition of his textbook that: “if price increases could be held 
down to say less than 5 per cent per year, such a mild steady inflation need not cause too much concern” (Samuelson, 
quoted  in  Leeson,  1997  p.  455).  This  idea  that  would  be  repeated  in  a  paper,  he  co-authored  with  Robert  Solow 
(Samuelson & Solow 1960, p. 192), where both authors claimed that 4 or 5 percent inflation would be the necessary 
cost of enjoying high rates of employment and economic growth.  
7 To cite a couple of books (see references therein for further literature), Hagger (1977) deploys an extensive survey up 
to 1976 and Okun & Perry (1978) compile the papers presented and discussed in a Conference held in Washington D.C. 
in the spring of 1978. To that effect, it suffices to show that in the 1960s only two fairly encompassing surveys on

Vera  (2013)  has  recently  challenged  the  claim  regarding  the  authorship  of  the  model  - 
commonly ascribed to Simonsen and Pazos – retrieving some overlooked documents that bear out 
Nicholas  Kaldor´s  (1957a,  1957b,  1957c)  innovative  input  in  the  early  debates  concerning 
economic  theories  and  policies  of  growth,  distribution  and  inflation  in  Latin  America.8  After  his 

 

                                                                                                                                                                
inflation theories were carried out (Bronfenbrenner & Holzman 1963; Brechling 1968), whilst a watershed of surveys 
and books entirely focused on inflation took over the profession in the 1970s. To keep our bibliographical references 
within bounds, we have been able to count at least six wide-ranging surveys along the mid-1970s (Laidler & Parkin 
1975; Gordon 1976; Humphrey 1976; Frisch 1977; Harberger 1978 and Tobin 1980), as well as several books on the 
same topic of controversies and advances in inflation theories and their empirical support. 
8  Regarding  connections  between  Kaldor’s  contribution  and  those  by  Felipe  Pazos  and  M.H.  Simonsen,  we  may 
entertain the following: during his stay in Chile and then in Brazil, especially at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, where 
the International Economics Association Conference was held, Nicholas Kaldor most certainly had the opportunity to 
exchange ideas with both Felipe Pazos and Mario Henrique Simonsen, both of whom would later be responsible for 
publicizing, in greater detail, Kaldor’s 1956 sketch of the “saw-tooth” model. The records of the Conference were to no 
avail as of the writing of this thesis, but the fact that Cuban economists Felipe Pazos was one of the lecturers in the 
1957 edition of the conference (see RBE 1957 and Kaldor, 1957b) suggests he may have attended Kaldor’s lectures in 
1956.  Even  if  he  had  not  been  personally  present  at  the  latter,  Pazos’s  connection  with  CEPAL’s  economist  Victor 
Urquidi is documented in their 1956 translation of Michal Kalecki’s (1954) Theory of Economic Dynamics: An essay on 
cyclical and long-run changes in the capitalist economy (Kalecki, 1956). Urquidi was a close participant in the first 
efforts to develop the Latin American structuralist theory of inflation and witnessed all the twists and turns of the early 
days of the new “inflation theory” (see Boianovsky, 2012; Palma & Marcel, 1989). Therefore, it is highly probable that 
Pazos had gotten word of the message conveyed by Kaldor.  As regards Simonsen, he was trained as an engineer and an 
economist  in  the  late  1950s  and  early  1960s  and  became  the  first  director  of  the  School  of  Graduate  Studies  in 
Economics  (EPGE)  at  the  Getúlio  Vargas  Foundation,  Rio  de  Janeiro  (Biderman,  Cozac  &  Rego  1996,  p.  189  and 
Boianovsky 2002, Note 1, p. 67). Kaldor visited Rio de Janeiro in October 1956, which allows for the possibility of 

5 

 

stay  in  Chile,  Kaldor  travelled  to  Brazil,  in  October  1956,  where  he  attended  a  meeting  of  the 
International  Economic  Association  and  gave  several  lectures  on  the  relationship  between 
agriculture and industrialization in developing countries, which can be found in Kaldor (1957b). His 
analysis  of  the  connection  between  inflation  and  development,  Kaldor  (1957c)  set  up  a  verbal 
model of conflicting claims that accounted for the self-sustaining pattern of inflation.  

	  

In  evaluating  wage  dynamics,  Kaldor  (1957c,  p.  75)  assumes  that  nominal  wages  are 
periodically  adjusted  to  cost-of-living  indicators  (p.  66-67),  but  readily  devises  an  asymmetry 
between the frequency of price adjustments and those of wages9: “while the adjustment of prices to 
changes  in  wages  is  gradual,  the  adjustment  of  wages  to  changes  in  prices  tend  to  occur 
periodically  considering,  at  one  stroke,  the  accumulated  change  in  the  cost  of  living  relative  to 
some previous base date” (p. 75). He then draws out a straightforward regularity from the real wage 
behavior in an inflationary environment: “Real wages thus fluctuate around an average set by the 
extremes of the level of wages immediately prior to and immediately after a particular adjustment”. 
Next, Kaldor describes the visual pattern of real wages when the inflation rate picks up speed: “The 
characteristic  of  the  wage/price  spiral  is  that  the  zig-zag  becomes  increasingly  compressed  -  the 
periods between subsequent wage adjustments tend to become successively shorter. This means, of 
course, a continued acceleration in the rate of increase in the general price level (Kaldor, 1957c, p. 
75). This description is followed by the diagrammatic representation, in the  
2 
below,  of  the  process  of  erosion  of  the  purchasing  power  of  nominal  wages  under  persistent 
inflation.

We  agree  with  Vera  (2013,  p.  277)  in  that  Kaldor’s  relevant  contribution  to  this  debate 
extends  beyond  the  mere  graphic  representation  of  the  “saw-tooth  model”:  he  should  also  be 
acknowledged for having anticipated the impact of endogenous variations in contract length in the 
acceleration process of inflation. Vera’s findings provide, on the one hand, further insight into the 
dissemination  of  scientific  knowledge,  but  on  the  other,  they  raise  further  questions.  In  what 
follows,  we  take  issue  with  this  interpretation  and  provide  further  evidence  of  an  even  earlier 
recognition of the same pattern, in addition to Bent Hansen’s en passant depiction of the process in 
his 1951 book (see next section). Let us explore this maxim further taking heed - as Vera (2013) did 
- of Feiwel´s (1975) reminder that scientific work does not occur in a vacuum and, by this token, no 
discovery  is  totally  new.  We  move  back  in  time,  to  find  anticipations  of  Kaldor’s  marterly 
description in previous years. 

The discursive representation of the saw-tooth pattern of real wages  

In  his  magnum  opus,  The  Economic  Growth  of  Brazil,  Furtado  ([1959]  1963,  chapter 
XXXV) had tackled the “two sides of the inflationary process”, that is, “the reason why prices rise 
on a persistent basis” and “the effects of such rise on the economic process”. Furtado starts out with 
a  dynamic  equilibrium  concept  of  neutral  inflation  from  the  distributional  standpoint.  A  neutral 
inflation implies that a distributional profile is left unaffected by the rise in the price level. As a 
dynamic concept, it is observed along a process of adjustment, e.g. one-year-long circuit. At any 
point  during  this  period,  “there  is  bound  to  be  a  group  ahead  of  others  in  the  struggle  for  the 
redistribution of income”. This group would benefit enormously from the stabilization of the price 
level  at  that  point.  Dynamically  speaking,  even  if  one  could  find  an  “average  pattern  of  income 
distribution  in  a  one-year  stretch”,  and  that  make  prices  stabilize  around  this  pattern  through 
sequential price and wage adjustments.  

When  all  groups  are  institutionally  and/or  economically  equipped  to  defend  themselves 
against the erosion of their real income and have a clear notion of the position they occupy in that 
moment’s distributional profile of the economy, a successful stabilization becomes a troublesome 
task, for it is very unlikely that every group would be entirely satisfied with the end result (Furtado 
[1959] 1963, p. 239). To this effect, any stabilization program would face insurmountable hurdles 
due to this staggered structure of price and wage behavior. This self-reinforcing struggle leads to the 
“elevation of the price level goes on displacing the system from one unstable equilibrium position to 
the other” with no automatic – or even existent, to that effect - countervailing process to restore the 
system to a stable equilibrium position (p. 239). 

For a history-mindful structuralist economist, Furtado’s narrative is surprisingly mechanical 
in form.10 Despite Furtado’s lack of enthusiasm with this “neutral inflation”11, this is the first real 
                                                 
10 For one, it is no wonder Furtado found such a phenomenon “of little interest to the economic analyst”. Apart from 
that, his description of the former reflects with astounding precision the later narrative entailed by the mathematical 
saw-tooth  model.  One  cannot  help  but  be  struck  by  similarity  in  the  discursive  structure  between  Furtado’s  take  on 
neutral inflation and later representations by the eocnomists at PUC-Rio, in the early 1980s (see Lopes & Williamson 
[1978]  1980  and  Modiano  1988).  At  the  risk  underemphasizing  the  historical  context  of  his  thoughts  on  inflation, 
Furtado was prescient, as early as 1954 –, of the challenged posed to disinflation measures by the lack of synchronism 
among  the  adjustment  frequencies  of  contracts  and  prices,  a  problem  that  would  bedevil  policymakers  in  charge  of 
stabilization plans in the 1980s.

theoretical assessment, as far as we know, of a fully indexed economy in Latin America. Although 
Noyola (1956a) had come to grips with a similar process, as Boianovsky (2012, p. 293-294) notes, 
this chapter of Furtado’s ([1959] 1963) book is but a literal copy of an excerpt (p. 174-187) of his 
1954  book  on  the  Brazilian  Economy  (Furtado  1954),  thereby  anticipating  Noyola’s  view  on 
inflation as distributional struggle among income claimants and, possibly, as a neutral phenomenon 
from the distributive point of view.12  

If we turn to empirics, although Furtado is clearly alluding to wages at large, available data 
on real minimum wage in Brazil is consistent Furtado’s basic dynamic framework. It would be a 
stretch  to  claim  that  Figure  2  below  visually  depicts  the  distributional  dynamics  Furtado  had  in 
mind. However, if we assume, for the sake of this counterfactual exercise, that all other income-
recipients respond defensively to increases in minimum wage, the sawtooth shape of wage behavior 
can be easily noted. Even so, the data evokes not the “neutral” inflation, by which the peak real 
wage should be lined up at the same level through time.13

11 In light of this the points just raised, he did not believe “neutral inflation” to be of any significance to economists, for 
inflation would be a “sterile process” in the march toward development, for it entailed absolutely no real effects on the 
allocation of resources (Furtado, [1959] 1963, p. 239), a conclusion that Simonsen (1970, p. 208) would later agree with 
in its entirety. Later, in his Diagnosis of the Brazilian Crisis ([1962] 1965, p. 101-113), Furtado amended his earlier 
notion  with  an  appraisal  of  the  unbounded  excitement  of  distributional  struggles  that  eventually  degenerates  in  an 
inflationary  spiral.  As  inflation  becomes  an  inseparable  part  of  the  growth  process,  its  positive  effects  upon  output 
growth cease and “the reaction of the working masses becomes increasingly rapid, and adjustments to earnings have to 
be made at increasingly shorter intervals”; this implies losses to wage-earners that are “probably greater than the gains 
still made from inflation by the capitalist class”. This is the “sterile phase of inflation” or the pointless “game of passing 
the buck” (p. 107). See also Noyola (1955a and 1955b) for a review of Furtado (1954) where the above point relating to 
neutral inflation is also overlooked. 
12 It is worth stressing that Furtado’s reasoning on neutral inflation relies on a sophisticated and abstract conflicting 
claims approach that glaringly resembles the analysis by the French economist Aujac (1950) (see Craven 1994), which 
is telling of how far-reaching conflict theories were at the time. 
13 Instead, under the strong assumptions above, it suggests an excited distributional struggle between profits and wages, 
whereby  the  peak  real  minimum  wage  is  being  continuously  pushed  upwards  by  Getúlio  Vargas’s  (1951-54)  and 
Juscelino Kubitschek’s (1956-1961) administrations.

It  is  somewhat  striking  that  Furtado´s  straightforward  contribution  to  a  dynamic 
understanding  of  inflation  has  been  so  widely  overlooked  (as  in,  for  instance,  Palma  &  Marcel 
1989, p. 254), when its basic narrative is practically a verbatim reproduction of Kaldor´s (1957c) 
scheme.14 

The  fact  that  more  than  one  economist  was  able  to  devise  this  pattern  in  seemingly 
independent  fashion  from  each  other,  suggests  that  scattered  (and  unsubstantiated)  notions 
regarding the phenomenon were probably “in the air”. We have show above that the models of first-
generation  structuralist  were  formalized  in  discursive  form,  that  is,  borrowing  Morgan’s  (2012) 
expression, in a “sea of words”. They upheld this core analytical thrust on a methodological basis. 
The contrast between this mode of reasoning and the indisputable mechanic form of the real wage 
pattern analyzed thus far provokes the suspicion that they shared a common cognitive procedure, at 
one level of abstraction higher. Next sections harkens further a few of years earlier than Furtado’s 
contribution  to  find  this  visual  pattern  of  real  incomes  in  its  seemingly  institutions-laden 
neoclassical framing.  

3.  The first Neoclassical moments of the sawtooth model 

Bent Hansen has put forth an account of inflation theory in his 1951 book, titled A Study in 
the  Theory  of  Inflation.15  Hansen  sets  out  to  demonstrate  that  inflation  may  arise  before  full-
employment is achieved launching a two-sector model comprised of a goods market and a factor 
market.  When  analyzing  a  policy  of  constant  real  wage  (w/p),  Hansen  (1951)  brought  in  an 
institutional  factor  of  the  interval  in  between  adjustments  of  nominal  wages,  so  that  the  above 
relation  falls  discontinuously  along  this  interval  and  then  is  adjusted,  pushing  inflation  up  at 
discontinuous upward jerks. Since wages rise independently of supply and demand adjustment in 
the labor market (p. 16), a continuous “induced inflation”16 ensues, which thus press upon prices in 
the commodities sector, resulting in a wage-price spiral. To illustrate this process, Hansen displays 
a set of diagrams that represent the time path of each set of variables; among them, the “saw-tooth” 
pattern  of  real  wage  behavior  under  constant  inflation,  as  in  the  Error!  Reference  source  not 
found. below. Hansen explores these possibilities allowing for the influence of monopoly (with a 
sort  of  mark-up  pricing)  and  price  controls  on  inflation  dynamics.  His  implicit  notion  on  an 
                                                 
14 It is rather revealing of the intellectual landscape of those times that these saw-tooth-shaped wage dynamics were 
developed  in  synchrony  with  the  full-blown  adoption  of  government-sponsored  import-substituting  industrialization 
effort, that is, from 1951 forth; hence the idea that inflation is both cause and effect of distributional patterns along the 
cycle  of  adjustments  to  structural  changes.  Almost  a  decade  after  Furtado’s  (1954)  published  his  view  of  inflation, 
Pazos’s (1963) first writing on the oscillating pattern of real wages appeared in his book “Notas para un Estudio de la 
Espiral Inflacionaria”, published by the Mexican journal El Trimestre Economico in 1963 and also in the first volume 
of the “Centro de Estudios Monetarios Lationamericanos” – CEMLA with the support by The International Monetary 
Fund and the Interamerican Bank for Development (IBD), both from Washington D.C. Pazos (1963, p. 612) presents a 
table with nominal and real wages within a staggered structure of wage adjustments. Although it is still quite vague in 
its shape, the oscillating behavior of wages is taken into account, when he states that “real wages vary throughout the 
year and at any moment, except for a brief interval, the wages of each group of workers is above or below its annual 
average. This circumstance creates serious difficulties to the application of a wage freeze that proves fair and effective 
at the same time”(Pazos 1969, p.612) (my translation).  
15 See Day (1952) and Hagger (1961) for outlines of Hansen’s theory and further references therein.  
16 Hansen uses the term “induced” in the sense of an “autonomous” or “spontaneous” factor-related cost-inflation (See 
Hansen 1951, chapters 1 & 2).

inflationary  monetary  equilibrium  is  extensively  informative  (perhaps  even  prescient?)  of  the 
challenges that inflation would later impose on economic policymakers worldwide in the 1970s.

p. 170, fig. 18). 

 

This result comes out of the “price-inertia coefficients” (p. 227), a feature present in each 
and every sector of the economy, which is denoted by the reciprocal of constant k (>0), embedded 
in the price-reaction equations such as in the expression below: 

𝑑𝑝!𝑑𝑡=𝑝!  .𝑘  .𝑥!𝑞!   
where  the  time-variation  of  a  specific  price  !!!!"
inertia coefficient (k) and by the ratio of excess demand (𝑥!) to supply of commodity (𝑞!). Hansen 
the  length  of  the  period  be 𝛥𝑡  (=𝑡!−𝑡!),  and  the  excess  demand  at 𝑡!  by 𝑥!!,  we  find  the 

then  moves  on  to  a  “discontinuous  analysis”,  in  which  “the  changes  of  prices  occur  only  at  the 
beginning of each period and are such that the excess demand occurring in the preceding period 
determines the marking-up of the price at the beginning of the period considered” (p. 224). Letting 

  is  a  function  of  itself  multiplied  by  the  price-

corresponding discrete relation to the above equation: 

𝛥𝑝!=𝑝!!  .𝑘  .𝑥!!𝑞!!.𝛥𝑡 

Thus the longer the period and the greater the value of the constant (k), the higher will be the 
variation  of  prices  due  to  a  lagged  response  of  prices  to  excess  demand.  Hansen  admits  that,  in 
reality, “it is not possible to reckon that k – of which the reciprocal can be taken to express inertia of 

10 

 

	  

prices with respect to ‘induced’ changes – will in general be the same for all commodities and for 
all factors” (p. 225). The relevant price index, in the discontinuous case must have the form of 

𝛴 1𝑘!
𝛴 1𝑘!

.𝑝!!
.𝑝!! 

so that the weights are represented by the “price-inertia coefficients”.  

Hence,  Hansen  anticipated  the  graphical  dynamical  representation  of  the  direct  inverse 
relationship  between  real  wages  and  inflation  in  a  system  of  periodically  adjusted  fixed  nominal 
incomes, the very matter of later speculations on the determinants of inflation in Latin America. 
The  relevance  of  Hansen’s  contribution  has  been  somewhat  limited  to  punctuated  references  in 
macroeconomic  history  subsequent  to  the  1950s  –  being  Simkin  (1952)  and  Pitchford  (1957) 
notable exceptions17. Hansen’s inflation theory would – unexpectedly, one might add - influence 
Juan Noyola Vasquez (1956a; 1956b, p. 276) in his understanding of inflation.18 Interestingly, the 
theory  Hansen  puts  forth  cannot  easily  escape  the  typical  CEPAL-based  criticism  of  being 
essentially a-historical and essentially mechanical in nature, although many institutional aspects are 
considered  throughout  his  book  and  his  analytical  framework  is  frequently  liable  to  historical 
comparisons (see Hansen, 1951, p. 239-248).19  

Hansen’s contribution can be construed as a symptom of an emergent tradition that gained 
momentum in the immediate post-war period and was further emboldened in the decades following, 
when  the  intellectual  landscape  of  the  economics  profession  grew  more  mechanically  and 
mathematically  oriented.20  For  the  reasons  lined  up  above,  it  is  not  far-fetched  to  assume  that 

                                                 
17 This very fact is inkling of Hansen’s impact in the profession may have been more intense than we can infer from 
available  documentation.  Bent  Hansen  would  later  to  inspire  one  of  the  threads  of  disequilibrium  macroeconomics, 
namely,  Jean-Pascal  Bénassy’s  model  of  three  regimes  (Backhouse  &  Boianovsky  2013,  p.  73  and  p.114-119),  not 
mention the conflicting-claims-inspired approach to the new neoclassical synthesis carried by Carlin & Soskice (1990 
and 2006), although no credit to Hansen is acknowledged by the authors. It would be out of place to try to foray into the 
reasons for this, but we suspect that Hansen’s had too conciliatory a tone for his own good when it came to joining 
separate  lineages  of  models  into  one  analytical  construct.  However,  one  should  not  fail  to  notice  this,  the  fact  that 
Hansen  was  up  to  date  with  mathematical  modeling  (linear  difference  and  differential  equations)  so  dear  to  the 
emerging Samuelsonian world may have facilitated his legacy to be preserved, albeit with extensive amputations. 
18  To  support  this  assertion  we  point  to  the  rather  peculiar  overall  “conflicting  claims”  vocabulary  Hansen  adopts. 
Concepts such as “Class struggle” and “Class warfare”, capitalists and workers with different propensities to consume 
are  all  part  of  the  parlance.  Also  the  definition  of  a  wage-price  spiral  within  a  general  equilibrium  setting,  whereby 
quasi-equilibria populated the expected results, and moving dynamic equilibria were achieve with the aid of adaptive 
and forward-looking expectations. For further details, see Hansen (1951, pages 17 and 246).  
19 Even so, his commitment to a theory that considered explicitly the institutional features of modern capitalism should 
be enough to make his analysis stand out. The following excerpt can give an illustration of our point: “They way in 
which spontaneous changes can eventually be avoided will not be considered here. The causal factors involved belong 
for the greater part to the field of politics and social psychology (the ‘class struggle’), so that it is only possible to treat 
them economically to a minor degree. The problem is actually closely relaed to that of abolishing monopoly in all its 
aspects” (Hansen, 1951, p. 246). These aspects are highly influential of the results obtained in the model and are thus 
liable to a careful examination, although economics is, in Hansen’s view, quite limited in dealing with them. 
20 Against this backdrop, Mario Henrique Simonsen would later set forth his rather eclectic approach to the dynamics of 
inflation in Brazil, as well as his graphic depiction of it (see section 1 above). As we have seen hitherto, Simonsen’s 

11 

 

	  

Furtado  had  access  to  Hansen’s  theory  in  1951,  but  this  is  yet  to  be  established  in  documental 
evidence. Given the timid reception of the Swedish economist’s book in the anglo-saxon economics 
quarters of the profession, it is more plausible to assume the Hansen’s influence worked through 
CEPAL  –  perhaps  through  his  connection  with  Noyola  -  than  through  Kaldor.  Apart  from  that, 
Hansen’s  approach  finds  an  analogue  in  the  emerging  Operations  Research  program,  which 
provides a common ancestor for the analyses by Hansen, Furtado and Kaldor.  

4.  The general mechanics of the saw-tooth diagram: a working hypothesis 

Our brief outline of Hansen’s inflation theory showed that such a visual representation was 
not entirely new to economists in early 1950s. It is another question entirely how wide was its use 
within the economics profession. Thus, in our seemingly archaeological retrieval of this sawtooth-
shaped “object of economic reasoning” (Morgan 2012), Nicholas Kaldor and Bent Hansen appear to 
take on a significant role. But how did Kaldor and Hansen come across this particular use of this 
pattern? Information on Hansen’s life is scarce, for which reason we follow the more abundantly 
documented events in Kaldor’s life and work. Before we proceed, a note of caution is in order. The 
evidence on the connections we a trying to purport is still scant but a set of suggestive clues points 
us in the direction of our general claim.21  

The  intellectual  environment  of  the  wartime  was  highly  conducive  to  the  fertilization  of 
economic  ideas  by  modeling  formats  borrowed  from  mathematics  and  engineering.  At  the  time, 
Operations Research was one of the central areas of investigation in the border among social and 
exact  sciences  (see  Whitin  1952  and  Mirrowski  2002).22  As  it  so  happened,  this  intellectual 
environment is likely to have influenced Kaldor in depicting the way he did the problem of real 
wages under chronic inflation, as just seen above. But how so? Inventory management policy was 
among the areas covered by this institutional effort (see Metzler 1941 and Arrow, Harris & Scarf 
1958, chapter 1). As it turns out, the visual pattern extracted from inventory theoretic approaches 
was revealed as quite influential on the economics profession of that time.  

                                                                                                                                                                
(1964, 1970) apparent innovative merits, as regards the saw-tooth model of real wages, should be restated as a masterly 
synthesis of what was already in the air for quite some time in those days. 
21 Kaldor had relevant contributions in an extensive list of topics in economics, mostly concerned with “real world” 
problems of welfare (cost-benefit) analysis, development, growth and distribution and taxation policy. He also took part 
in several government positions and was a renowned economic advisor on matters development policy for governments 
all around the world. According to J.K Galbraith’s autobiography, by being such a star economist and by taking part in 
such  high-profile  dwellings,  Kaldor  was  certainly  in  close  contact  with  developments  in  cutting-edge  economics  of 
those  times,  given  his  conspicuous  presence  in  Lionel  Robbins’s  world-class  seminars  at  the  London  School  of 
Economics (LSE) and, later, holding a teaching position at Cambridge University. In what follows, we line up a few 
pointers regarding the academic context of Kaldor’s contribution. 
22  Mathematicians,  Physicists  and  Engineers  migrated  into  Economics  joined  economists  in  applying  linear 
programming techniques into this wide-encompassing area of Operations Research, which sought to do away with the 
supposed  lack  of  rigor  of  the  social  sciences,  at  least  from  the  standpoint  of  those  hard  sciences.  In  this  sense,  the 
Cowles Commission stationed at the University of Chicago was crucial to the developments we are about to turn to. In 
1948, when the RAND Corporation becomes the main patron of Cowles, a major shift in the research agenda leads 
concerns  toward  the  axiomatization  of  choice  theory,  seeking  to  provide  the  Operations  Research  quarters  optimal 
decision rules (Mirrowski 2002).

Operations Research and Economics: cross-breeding effects 

	  

In the summer of 1950, a paper entitled Optimal Inventory Policy was presented by Kenneth 
Arrow,  Theodore  Harris  and  Jacob  Marschak  (1950)  -  henceforth,  AHM  -  at  the  Logistics 
Conference organized by the RAND Corporation, in Santa Monica, California (see Arrow 2002). 
The article outlines a method for deriving optimal rules for inventory policy of finished goods. In 
the  analysis  of  the  “case  of  certainty”,  a  deterministic  model  is  presented,  which  establishes  a 
constant flow of demand for goods (x) that depletes the stock. When the inventory reaches a critical 
point, a purchase order is put forth in order to replenish the stock of goods. Time frame is set in 

discrete time with an i-th interval, given by 𝜃!. Under certain conditions, the optimal policy relates 

to an optimal time length between purchase orders. In the authors´ words: “the intervals, possibly 
excepting the first one, will have the same length and the same optimal highest and lowest stock 
levels”, as shown in “Panel 1b” in Figure 2 below. 

 

Figure 2 – Non-optimal and Optimal inventory policy. Source: Arrow, Harris & Marshack  (1950, p. 253) 

Two  years  later,  AHM’s  model  was  translated  into  macroeconomics  via  an  illustration  of 
demand for cash balances with an interest rate opportunity cost. Baumol (1952) entitled his paper 
The Transactions Demand for Cash: An Inventory Theoretic Approach, in which the demand flow 
(x) in Arrow’s and his co-authors’ deterministic model is replaced by the interest rate that erodes the 
time-value of money holdings “in a steady stream”. The model thus aims at analyzing “transactions 
demand for cash dictated by rational behavior, which for our purposes means the holding of those 
cash balances that can do the job at minimum cost”. Quoting Baumol at a yet greater length: 

A stock of cash is its holder's inventory of the medium of exchange, and like an inventory of a 
commodity, cash is held because it can be given up at the appropriate moment, serving then 
as  its  possessor's  part  of  the  bargain  in  an  exchange.  We  might  consequently  expect  that 
inventory  theory  and  monetary  theory  can  learn  from  one  another.  This  note  attempts  to 
apply one well-known result in inventory control analysis to the theory of Money (Baumol 
1952, p. 545 – emphasis added). 

Baumol refers, in footnote 1 (1952 p. 545), to AHM’s model and expands on the fruitfulness 
of  the  this  crossbreeding  between  inventory  theory  and  economics  and  mentions,  somewhat  en 
passant, that this had been previously done in mid-1920s by “some half dozen writers”. He also 

13 

 

	  

makes reference to Whitin (1952), where he took the basic framework for his inventory theoretic 
approach.23  

The  problem  can  be  stated  as  follows:  an  individual  that  makes  a  “steady  stream”  of 
payments (T dollars) in the course of a certain period. Cash is either obtained through borrowing or 
withdrawing  it  from  an  investment;  in  both  cases,  there  is  an  interest  (opportunity)  cost  (i)  per 
period for holding the non-interest-bearing asset. Finally, the individual is set to withdraw cash in 
C-size amounts in evenly spaced periods throughout the year, which collects a “broker’s fee” (b 
dollars) for each time she makes a withdrawal. The value of transactions T is predetermined and i 
and  b  are  assumed  constant.  The  total  number  of  withdrawals  will  be  given  by  (T/C)  at  a  total 
broker’s fee of (bT/C) over a one-year period. Additionally, since each time she withdraws C she 
spends  it  in  a  steady  stream  and  takes  out  a  similar  amount  once  it  is  gone,  her  average  cash 
holdings are given by C/2 dollars. It is this latter steady stream definition of average cash balances 
that makes up for the sawtooth-shape of the later widely known diagrammatic representation of this 
model.  

Therefore, under these assumptions, the individual will then incur in an opportunity cost of 
(iC/2) over the period.  The total cost of using cash to meet one’s transactions needs is constrained 
by  rationality  conditions  that  require  minimizing  the  cost  of  holding  cash.  This  minimization 
procedure was transposed almost ipsis literis from Whitin (1952, p. 505), where C is the quantity 
purchased  of  a  good  that  minimizes  the  combined  ordering  costs  and  carrying  charges.  Also  in 
Whitin (1953, chapter 3), we find the same notation regarding the deterministic model of “economic 
purchase quantities” generating the saw-tooth pattern, as in Figure 3 below.

23 Baumol’s (1952, p. 545) fully quoted footnote is as follows: “T. M. Whitin informs me that the result in question goes 
back to the middle of the 1920's when it seems to have been arrived at independently by some half dozen writers (…). Its 
significant implications for the economic theory of inventory, particularly for business cycle theory, seem to have gone 
unrecognized until recently when Dr. Whitin analyzed them in his forthcoming Inventory Control and Economic Theory 
(…)  which,  incidentally,  first  suggested  the  subject  of  this  note  to  me.  See  also,  Dr.  Whitin's  "Inventory  Control  in 
Theory  and  Practice"  (elsewhere  in  this  issue,  supra,  p.  502),  and  Kenneth  J.  Arrow,  Theodore  Harris,  and  Jacob 
Marschak, "Optimal Inventory Policy," Econometrica, Vol. 19, July 1951, especially pp. 252-255. In addition to Dr. 
Whitin, I am heavily indebted to Professors Chandler, Coale, Gurley, Lutz, Mr. Turvey, and Professor Viner, and to the 
members of the graduate seminar at Harvard University, where much of this paper was first present”. 

14 

 

	  

A  few  years  later,  Tobin  (1956)  would  pursue  the  same  avenue  of  analysis,  in  his  The 
interest-elasticity of transactions demand for money. He mentions in the first footnote (p. 241) that 
he  had  not  read  Baumol’s  1952  paper.  Tobin  makes  no  mention  to  the  modeling  format  and  its 
origin  in  the  1956  paper.  Later  on,  in  a  1961  article,  he  would  acknowledge  due  credit  to  the 
borrowed inventory theory:  

The theory of optimal inventory holdings, for example, shows how transactions and delivery 
costs must be balanced against interest and carrying costs. Applied to inventories of cash, 
the  theory  gives  precision  to  the  relation  of  cash  holdings  to  the  volume  of  nonfinancial 
transactions,  the  costs  of  asset  exchanges,  and  the  yields  available  on  alternative  assets. 
(Tobin 1961, p. 25) 

If it is beyond doubt that inventory theory was crucial to frame the ideas both authors set 
forth,  it  much  less  clear  how  the  “saw-tooth  pattern”  came  to  be  attached  to  the  Allais-Baumol-
Tobin connection24, for neither the authors explicitly allude to this visual format. But once again, it 
is evident is that inventory theory has brought a significant inspiration to economists.25  

Concluding Remarks 

The present paper attempted to shed light on the rich reservoir of overlooked contributions in the 
history of economic ideas. Our narrative enhances the old adage by which no scientific discovery is 
entirely  new,  granted  that  some  prior  input  can  always  be  found  somewhere  hidden  in  the  past, 
albeit with a different purpose in mind or embedded in a distinct multitextual background. In order 
to tap this well of foregone contributions, we focused the supposedly early years of the sawtooth-
shaped diagram, also dubbed by Vera (2013) Kaldor-Pazos-Simonsen mechanism.  
 
Looking beyond the strictures of modeling and into the historical context, both the emerging 
OR program and Bent Hansen’s inflation model with price-inertia indicate that Kaldor – and, for 
that sake, Furtado as well - borrowed this type of reasoning from the boiling intellectual landscape 
                                                 
24  The  introduction  of  Maurice  Allais  here  honors  historical  accuracy  for  his  alleged  priority  in  deriving  the 
mathematical basis for the optimization as it was adopted in the cash-balance theory. In a communication published in 
Journal of Economic Literature, at the occasion Allais was awarded the Nobel Prize, William Baumol and James Tobin 
recognized his early contribution as a forerunner of their own. In the authors’ words: “Maurice Allais' well-deserved 
Nobel  Prize  fortuitously  brought  to  our  attention  an  injustice  inadvertently  done  him,  to  which  we  were  unknowing 
accessories. For years the literature has ascribed to us the parentage of the transactions-cost model of optimal cash 
balances, with its notorious square-root formula derived from inventory theory.' Recently, we found that its essence is 
contained in Allais' 1947 Economie et Intérêt (pp. 238-41). As Jacob Viner used to say, no matter to what source the 
origin of an economic proposition is ascribed, someone is sure to come up with an earlier one” (Baumol & Tobin, 
1989, p. 1160). See also Arrow (2002). Moreover, subsequent efforts, compiled in Arrow, Karlin & Scarf (1958), gave 
rise to the fruitful research program of (S,s) pricing policy models, as in Sheshinski & Weiss (1977 and 1983, p. 515). 
Caplin & Spulber (1987) would later apply the same inventory-theoretic - (s,S)-pricing policies -  format to depict the 
behavior  of  “real  prices”  under  inflationary  conditions.  I  thank  Prof.  Kenneth  Arrow  for  pointing  out  to  these 
connections in an e-mail sent to the author. 
25 Just to drive the point home, we can cite some later extensions of the contributions by Baumol and Tobin, which 
acknowledged  them  as  “‘inventory’  models”  (e.g.,  Javonovic  1982).  In  this  same  line,  Romer  (1986)  displays  the 
versatility of the Baumol-Tobin model by converting it into a general equilibrium framework. The purpose of Romer’s 
paper was to highlight the inflation-induced “shoe-leather” costs of frequent trips to the bank. Interestingly, he finds that 
in  a  model  with  money,  inflation  and  a  positive  interest  rate,  a  “sawtooth  pattern”  emerges  when  analyzing  the 
consumption stream (Romer 1986, p. 680).

of the economics profession in the early post-War years. As regards Hansen, no evidence was found 
thus far to support this connection, whereas to the OR program, the first inkling is provided by one 
of Kaldor’s biographers, who reports that 

	  

In 1945 he was seconded to the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, where he worked 
with  a  talented  team  of  economists  that  included  John  Kenneth  Galbraith  (the  Survey’s 
director), Paul Baran, Edward Denison, Fritz Schumacher and Tibor Scitovsky (Galbraith 
1979, pp. 219–20; 1981, p. 210). In the following year Kaldor worked briefly at the Ministry 
of  Defence  as  adviser  to  the  British  Bombing  Survey,  and  also  advised  the  Hungarian 
government on postwar reconstruction (King 2009, p. 57). 

Additionally, soon before coming to Latin America, Kaldor spent a few weeks in Stanford in 
April  1956,  where  he  visited  his  close  friend  Tibor  Scitovsky.  Kenneth  Arrow  had  been  part  of 
Stanford’s faculty since 1949, thus making it possible for Kaldor and Arrow to have met. However, 
in personal correspondence vie electronic mail with the author, Prof. Kenneth Arrow stated having 
no  recollection  of  Kaldor’s  participating  in  any  discussion  on  the  former’s  aforementioned  1951 
article - on the optimal inventory policy - nor of his time in Stanford prior to Kaldor’s coming to 
Latin America. While further historical documentation is, as of this date, to no avail in supporting 
this avenue of investigation, one at the analytical level points yet again further into the past. 

Kaldor  could  have  easily  derived  the  sawtooth-shaped  diagram  if  not  directly  from  the 
Allais-Baumol-Tobin apparatus, at least from an intuitive reading of Arrow, Harris and Marschak’s 
influential 1950 model. Instead of wealth and cash holding, a real magnitude such as the real wage 
would easily suffice. The stream of cash expenditure would give way to a steady inflation and, once 
a  critical  lower  bound  (the  lower  extreme)  were  achieved  the  restoration  of  the  previous  higher 
bound would ensue, restarting the cycle. Although it is not heavy-handed to assume that Kaldor had 
come across this type of modeling strategy and managed to generate an inflation-analogue to the 
inventory-theoretic  reasoning,  the  transition  from  one  application  to  the  other  seems  to  face  a 
daunting  analytical  obstacles,  such  as  the  behavior  of  prices  and  profits,  as  well  as  rents  and 
interest-based  income.  The  history  of  this  modeling-by-analogy  may  prove  rewarding  to  the 
understanding of the distributional theories of inflation that arose in the post-War years following 
the groundbreaking contributions by J.M Keynes (1940) and Michal Kalecki (1941a, 1941b, 1943). 
Finally,  a  word  of  caution  is  in  order.  Even  though  the  timetable  is  consistent,  this 
connection is, as it stands, simply a working hypothesis. The important message here alludes to one 
instance of how the inflation stabilization debates were affected that the overwhelming conquest of 
the  mathematical  sciences  over  economics  in  the  post-War  period,  as  documented  by  Mirowski 
(2002)  and  Weintraub  (2002),  among  others.  However,  the  saw-tooth  model  was  not  an 
immediately  welcome  contribution,  for  its  heyday  was  yet  to  come  a  quarter  of  century  later,  to 
inform  debates  on  anti-inflation  measures  in  chronically  inflationary  economies,  Brazil  in 
particular.  As  the  mathematical  revolution  slowly  settled  in  economics,  it  was  the  structuralist 
quarters of the profession that would soon rise up to the challenge of mathematically formalizing 
the arguments conveyed by the sawtooth-shaped visual representation, as in Lopes & Williamson 
(1978),  Bacha  &  Lopes  (1983)  and  Taylor  (1983),  for  instance.  We  leave  this  story  though  to 
another paper.
