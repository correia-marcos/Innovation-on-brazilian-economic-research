Abstract

The aim of this study is to analyze the operationality of the monetary policy cost chan-
nel in Brazil, highlighting the role played by the banks. For that, We present a New-
Keynesian DSGE model in which the costs of the ﬁrms are directly inﬂuenced by the
level of the banks loan rate. The model also tried to incorporates the possibility of a lim-
ited interest rate pass-through and the directed credit. I estimate the model by adopting
a minimum distance approach (Matching). The results indicate that: the cost channel
plays a decisive role in the monetary policy transmission, explaining the Price-Puzzle;
there is no evidence of incomplete interest rate pass-through; and, the directed credit re-
duces the monetary policy capacity to modify the credit conditions.

Keywords: Monetary Policy, Interest Rate Pass-Through, Cost Channel, Directed Credit.

Introduction

A growing literature has addressed the possibility that monetary policy action do not ony
affect aggregate demand, but also excert an inﬂuence on economic variables through the
supply side (Gaiotti and Secchi, 2006). Accordingly to the the cost channel mechanism of
monetary policy, some production costs increase with the interest rate, hence a monetary
contraction can promote an increase in prices instead of a decrease (Rabanal and Rubio-
Ramírez, 2007).

There is, at least, two kinds of evidence that point to the short run effects in the supply
side. The ﬁrst evidence is the price-puzzle of the monetary policy observed in several stud-
ies that applied the VAR methodology. These studies ﬁnd, as a result, that the prices level
increase after an increase in the interest rate. The second evidence is the degree of ampliﬁ-
cation. This evidence suggests that monetary policy shocks that induce to relatively small
and transitory movements in open-market interest rates have large and persistent effects on
output (Barth and Ramey, 2002).

The cost channel is incorporated in recent theoretical models. Christiano et al. (2005)
present a New-Keynesian DSGE model that incorporates the hypothesis of the credit for
working capital. The ﬁrms need to pay for the production factors before receiving revenue
from sales. As a result, the marginal costs of the ﬁrms depend positively on the interest
rate. Besides, a monetary contraction induce an upward pressure on prices. Ravenna and
Walsh (2006) introduce other economic shocks (productivity, preferences and government
spendings) in the model and they ﬁnd important implications in terms of the conduction of
the monetary policy: the shocks imply in the trade-off between stabilization of the product
and inﬂation; and, under optimal monetary policy, product and inﬂation return gradually
to their steady state value. Rabanal (2007), in turn, innovates by considering that only a
fraction of ﬁrms depends of the credit for working capital. Hülsewig et al. (2009) insert
banks that extend loans to ﬁrms in an environment of monopolistic competition by setting
their loan rates in a staggered way (only a fraction of the banks is able to adjust the loans
interest rate in each period), which means that the adjustment of the aggregate loan rate to a
monetary policy shock is sticky1. De Fiori and Tristani (2013) present a model that consider
assimetric information (under costly state veriﬁcation set-up a la Townsend) and default
risk, and, because of this, the bank lending rate incorporate a spread over the deposit rate.
Accordingly to the model, the inﬂation rate increases with the spread and the deposit rate.
According to Hülsewig et al. (2009), a number of studies have shown that the cost chan-
nel is empirically relevant in developed economies, e.g. Barth and Ramey (2002), Dedola
and Lippi (2005), Fabiani et al. (2006), Christiano et al. (2005), Ravenna and Walsh (2006),
Chowdhury et al. (2006) and Tillmann (2008). Hülsewig et al. (2009) also ﬁnd evidence that
this transmission channel is important to explain the inﬂation inertia which emerges after a
monetary policy shock in the Euro area, but its effect is mitigated because of a dispropor-
tionate adjustment of loan rates to changing money market rates.

Few studies, on other hand, analyze the cost channel of monetary policy for developing
economies. Agénor and Montiel (2008) argue that the cost channel may be relevant in these
countries because the bank debt is a signiﬁcant source of ﬁnancing operations for ﬁrms,
including the acquisition of ﬁxed capital assets, and the stock and corporate bond markets
are weak. However, Glen and Singh (2004) observe a signiﬁcant cross-country variation and
a declining trend of leverage ratio. According to Malikane (2012), it suggests that the cost

1Hülsewig et al. (2009) give a crucial role to the loan market structure. The cost channel operationality
depends on the banks’ capacity reacting to monetary policy shocks. If the proportion of banks that are able to
adjust their rates is reduced, then the effect of the monetary policy over the aggregate loan rate is also reduced,
and the cost channel is not relevant.

channel may be as important in emerging markets as it is in developed economies and it
may be declining in importance2.

The study of the relevance of the cost channel seems to be crucial to improve the un-
derstanding of the monetary policy effects in the Brazilian economy due to a number of
reasons. First, the Brazilian ﬁrms resort to credit for working capital in a signiﬁcant amount.
According the Brazilian Central Bank, the relative importance of this kind of credit indeed
increased among the ﬁrms from approximately 20% in 2007 to 30% in 2013.

Another motivation to analyze the cost channel is because the Brazilian ﬁrms have signif-
icant ﬁnancial expenses. According to the Annual Survey of Industry (The Brazilian Institute
of Geography and Statistics – IBGE), the ﬁnancial expenses represented around 11% of the
total costs of the Brazilian industrial ﬁrms between 2009 and 2012. Just for comparison, the
labor expenses represented 14% of the total costs in the same period. Hence, it is very likely
that changes in the total amount of ﬁnancial expenses inﬂuence the price and production
decisions.

There is, also, monetary policy price-puzzle evidences in VAR model estimations for the
Brazilian economy, e.g. Rabanal and Schwartz (2001), Arquete and Jayme-Jr. (2003), Sales
and Tannuri-Pianto (2005) and da Silva Guimarães and Monteiro (2014). It is worth to point
that, even for other studies in which the price-puzzle is not observed, the monetary policy
effect in inﬂation is reduced, lagged and temporary, e.g. Fernandes and Toro (2005) and
Céspedes et al. (2008).

Some changes in the Brazilian economy also motivate the cost channel analysis. The
monetary policy implementation was altered recently3, so there is no plenty understanding
about the policy transmission mechanisms in Brazil. Besides, Minella and Souza-Sobrinho
(2009) argue that the relative importance of the monetary policy transmission channels may
have been altered recently because of the, among other reasons, credit market expansion
and ﬁnancial markets development.

As observed for the other emerging economies, few studies analyze the cost channel in
Brazilian economy including Martins (2011), Malikane (2012), Kawamoto and Oreiro (2011)
and Santos (2011). There are signiﬁcant differences among these studies in terms of the
theoretical model, empirical strategy and results – only Martins (2011) and Kawamoto and
Oreiro (2011) ﬁnd evidences for the cost channel. Despite the differences, all of these studies
neglected the banks behaviour, as well the capacity of the interest rate, instrument of the
monetary policy, modify the credit conditions faced by the ﬁrms.

Considering the previous discussion, the aim of this paper is to analyze the channel cost
of monetary policy, highlighting the role played by the banks, by employing a DSGE New-
Keynesian model. In the model, the aggregate level of the loan rate directly inﬂuences the
costs of the ﬁrms. Besides, the model features ﬁnancial market rigidity, only a fraction of
the banks is able to adjust the loan rate each period. As a consequence, the reaction of the
aggregate loan rate to a monetary policy shock may be sticky (limited pass-through).

The novelty of the model presented in this paper is the incorporation of the directed
credit. The share of directed credit is signiﬁcant in Brazil. According to the Brazilian Cen-
tral Bank, the directed credit represented 43% of total of the credit operations in 2013. Be-
sides, the Brazilian directed credit presents peculiar features which inﬂuence the monetary
capacity in modifying the economy’s credit conditions. We can highlight three of these char-
acteristics: the directed credit loan rates are lower and more stable than the other credit
2Malikane (2012), by using robust estimation of the Phillips curve, does not ﬁnd evidence of the cost channel

in a group of emerging economies (Brazil included), the only exception is Mexico.

3The money targeting regime was replaced by the inﬂation target regime only in 1999. Since then, the Selic
rate (the banks’ overnight rate) is the most important instrument of monetary policy implementation (Sales
and Tannuri-Pianto, 2007).

modalities; the directed credit has public and private funds; and, the directed credit opera-
tions have been made mostly by large state owned banks. Hence, in the model, we assume
that a constant and exogenously determined fraction of the loans is made through directed
credit operations and the directed credit loan rate is also constant over time and exogenously
determined.

It’s worth to mention that, except by Santin (2013) and Sato (2013), no effort has been
made to shed some light about the relation among monetary policy and directed credit, in
spite of the media discussion. In this sense, we present a contribution to the policymakers,
once we develop and estimate a model for Brazil that features the proportion of the directed
credit as a determinant of the monetary policy capacity in modifying the economy’s credit
condition.

We estimate the DSGE for the Brazilian economy by using the Minimum Distance ap-
proach, which consists in two steps. First, we estimate a VAR model to generate empirical
impulse responses to a monetary policy shock. Second, we estimate the model parameters
by matching the theoretical impulse responses as closely as possible to the empirical impulse
responses. Considering the estimated model, we analyze the relevance of the channel cost.
Besides, we look for evidences of limited interest rate pass-through and the directed credit
inﬂuence over the monetary policy effect.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we display our eco-
nomic model.
In section 4, we
present and discuss the empirical analysis results. In section 5, we summarize the main
ﬁndings.

In section 3, we discuss our econometric methodology.

2 The Model

Hülsewig et al. (2009) build a New Keynesian DSGE model on the framework of Christiano
et al. (2005) and Smets and Wouters (2003)4 in order to study the relevance of the cost chan-
nel. The model consists of ﬁrms, households and banks.

The ﬁrms are partitioned into ﬁnal and intermediate good producers. The ﬁrms that
produce the ﬁnal good operate under perfect competition, and they use only the intermedi-
ate goods as inputs. The intermediate good producers, in turn, operate under monopolistic
competiton, it means that each ﬁrm have some monopoly power over prices that are set in a
staggered way as in Calvo (1983). The inputs of the intermediate goods are capital and labor
services. We account for a cost channel by assuming that a fraction of ﬁrms require loans
from banks as they are obliged to pay their wage bill in advance of selling their product.

Households obtain utility from consumption and leisure, they supply a differentiated
type of labor, own the capital stock and make investment decisions. They decide on their
wages, which are also set in a staggered way.

Finally, banks extent loans to ﬁrms in an environment of monopolistic competition. They
face frictions when changing their loan rates, which implies that the aggregate loan rate
reacts stickily to a monetary policy shock.

The equilibrium in the ﬁnal goods market is characterized by the equality of production
and demand by households for consumption and investment adjusted for the resource costs
attached to variable capital utilization. The market clearing conditions in the capital rental
market, the loan market and the labor market require that supply equals demand at the
prevailing market prices.

4According to Vereda and Cavalcanti (2010), these models have been the inspiration of the medium scale

DSGE models of several central banks.

The solution of the model was derived by taking a log-linear approximation around the
non-stochastic steady state of the economy with zero inﬂation. The model is closed by speci-
fying the reaction function of the central bank, which is described by a log-linearized interest
rate rule.

We modify the model employed by Hülsewig et al. (2009) in order to incorporate the
directed credit which is an important feature of Brazilian economy. Speciﬁcally, we divided
the ﬁnancial intermediaries into the banks that operate directed credit and the ones that
operate free credit. Similar to the model of Hülsewig et al. (2009), we assume that the free
credit banks extent loans to ﬁrms in an environment of monopolistic competition, and they
face frictions when changing their loan rates, which implies that the aggregate loan rate
reacts stickily to a monetary policy shock.

Next, we present the bank sector of our model. Firms and households are not discussed
in detail because we use the same formulation of Hülsewig et al. (2009). Then, we summa-
rize the relevant log-linearized relationships.

2.1 Banks
Banks indexed by k ∈ [0, 1] extend loans to ﬁrms in an environment of monopolistic compe-
tition. Proﬁts by bank k are given by:

t

Πbank

t(k)Lt(k) − Rd
(k) = Rl
(1)
t(k) is the gross loan rate, Dt(k) is the level of deposits,
where Lt(k) is the loan volume, Rl
t (k) is
Rd
the gross money market rate, which is controlled by the central bank. Proﬁts are distributed
to households at the end of each period.

t (k) is the gross deposit rate, Bt(k) is the net position on the money market and RM

t Dt(k) − RM

t Bt(k),

For each bank the balance sheet constraint is:

.

(2)
which relates the loan volume to the level of deposits and the net position on the money mar-
ket Deposit and money market credits are assumed to be perfect substitutes for reﬁnancing,
which implies that Rd

Lt(k) = Dt(k) + Bt(k),

Bank k maximizes proﬁts subject to the balance sheet constraint and the downward
sloped loan demand. In a ﬂexible loan market, each bank would set its loan rate as a mark-up
over nominal marginal costs. Since banks are exposed to identical marginal costs it holds
that the loan rate would be the same for eacho one of them.

t = RM
t

However, banks face frictions when setting their loan rates. First, a fraction τ2 of the
banks extend directed credit (DC) which loan rate is determined exogenously. The remain-
ing 1 − τ2 of the banks extend free credit (FC) and can choose their loan rates. Considering
this, the aggregate loan rate is given by:

Free credit banks face frictions when setting their loan rates. Following Calvo (1983), we
assume that only a fraction 1 − τ1 of free credit banks re-optimize their loan rates in each
period, while the remaining fraction τ1 keeps their loan rates unchanged:

The equation (7) show that the evolution of the aggregate loan rate depends on the relevance
of the parameters τ1 and τ2. If τ1 and τ2 go to zero, the aggregate loan rate tends to equal the
money rate and the pass-through becomes complete.

2.3 Additional Considerations on Loan Rates
We assume additionally that the loan rate of the directed credit (RDC

Besides, considering that there is not enough information about the aggregate loan rate for
the Brazilian economy, we replace RL

2.4 The Linearized Model
The following equations consist the log-linear approximation of the relevant model equa-
tions around the symmetric equilibrium steady state with zero inﬂation. The represen-
tation ˆXt denotes the log-linear deviation from the steady-state value of the variable X,
ˆXt = ln(Xt) − ln( ¯Xt), where ¯Xt is the steady-state value.

The parameter κp measures the sensitivity of inﬂation with respect to real marginal costs
( ˆϕt) which are given by:

The real marginal costs, and consequently the inﬂation, depend on the gross loan rate as
emphasized by the cost channel of monetary policy.

Nominal wage inﬂation is determined by future expected and past nominal wage inﬂation,
by the current and past inﬂation rate and by the gap between the marginal rate of substitu-

3 Empirical Methodology

We estimate the log-linear version of the DSGE model described in the previous section for
the Brazilian economy in order to analyze the relevance of the cost channel of monetary pol-
icy, the interest rate pass-through and the directed credit. We apply the minimum distance
approach as in Christiano et al. (2005), Carrillo et al. (2007), Henzel et al. (2009) e Hülsewig
et al. (2009). This estimation method consists in two steps. First, a VAR model is speciﬁed to
generate the empirical impulse-response functions, in our case, to a monetary policy shock.
Second, the model parameters are estimated in order to aproximate, as close as possible, the
theoretical and empirical impulse-response functions.

3.1 Monetary Policy Shock and VAR Model
As Christiano et al. (2005), we deﬁne the monetary policy by the following equation:

(25)
where Rt is the short-term interest rate (monetary instrument), f is a linear function, Φt is
a set of information and t is the monetary policy shock. We assume that the central bank
allows money growth to guarantee that equation (25) holds in any circumstances and t is
orhtogonal to the elements in Φt.

Rt = f (Φt) + t,

Considering the characterization of the monetary policy, the VAR model estimated for

the Brazilian economy has the following speciﬁcation:

(26)
where Zt is the endogenous variables vector, A(L) is the parameters matrix and εt is the
errors vector that we assume to be white noise. The vector Zt is composed by:

Zt = A(L)Zt−l + εt,

Zt = (GDPt, IN Ft, W IN Ft, CP It, RMt, RLt),

(27)
where GDPt is the real product, IN Ft is the inﬂation rate, W IN Ft is the nominal wage
inﬂation rate, CP It is the commodities price inﬂation rate, RMt is the monetary policy rate
and RLt is the loan rate.

The responses of the variables in Zt to a monetary policy shock are estimated by the
VAR model. The identiﬁcation of the shock is made by applying the Choleski (recursive)
decomposition. The variables ordering implies that the real product, inﬂation rate, nomi-
nal wage inﬂation rate and the commodities price inﬂation rate are affected by a monetary
policy shock with a lag, while the monetary policy interest rate and the loan rate are contem-
poraneously affected. This identiﬁcation scheme is debatable but the analysis is internally
consistent in the sense that we make the same assumptions in the theoretical model.

3.2 Minimum Distance Approach
We estimate part of model parameters by minimizing the distance between the empirical
and theoretical impulse response functions. The set of estimated parameters () are:

 = (h, θp, ωp, θw, ωw, µ1, µ ˆY , µπ, τ, ¯S(cid:48)(cid:48), µ2, µ∆ ˆY , ν).

The estimator minimize the following distance function (Christiano et al., 2005):

J = (ˆΓ − Γ())(cid:48)V−1(ˆΓ − Γ()),

where ˆΓ is the empirical impulse-response function, Γ() is the theoretical function and V
is the weighting matrix, with the sample variances of ˆΓ on the diagonal. The weighting ma-
trix assures that those point estimates with a smaller standard deviation are given a higher
priority5 (Henzel et al., 2009).

The other parameters are calibrated based on empirical evidence obtained from real
economy data and, in some cases, observed on previous studies. The calibration of a sub-
set of parameters is an usual practice in the case of the estimation of DSGE models because
some parameters cannot be identiﬁed by applying an unrestricted estimation strategy. The
decision of which parameters will be estimated is, on the other hand, rarely discussed and
vary among the studies. Our choose of calibrated parameters follows Hülsewig et al. (2009).
According to Smets and Wouters (2003), the estimation of DSGE models by using a
method that aims to aproximate as close as possible the theoretical and the data moments,
as the minimum distance approach, has two advantages: these methods allows highlighting
the features of the data for which the model is more relevant; and, the moments estimators
frequently are more robusts than the maximum likelihood methods.

Still, it is important to point out that the maximum likelihood methods can incur in the
problem of the stochastic singularity. More speciﬁcally, the DSGE models solutions deter-
mine identities that envolve the variables, and, if these identities is not satisﬁed by the data,
any attempt to adjust the model by using maximum likelihood methods won’t be success-
ful (Tovar, 2009). The stochastic singularity tend to occur when the number of theoretical
shocks is lower than the number of the observable endogenous variables (Boivin and Gian-
noni, 2006). Our model considers only one economic shock, therefore the minimum distance
approach is more properly to estimate the parameters.

3.3 Data
We use quartely data (2000:3 - 2013:4)6 of the log of the GDP chain index (IBGE), the inﬂation
measured by the annualized quarterly change of GDP deﬂator (IBGE), the nominal wage
inﬂation measured by annualized quarterly change of the usual nominal average income
of the main job index (IBGE), annualized quarterly change of the commodities price index
(FMI), short-term nominal interbank interest rate, Over-Selic (Central Bank of Brazil), and
the average bank lending rate for free credit (Central Bank of Brazil).

Figure 1 shows the graphics of the impulse-response functions of each VAR model variable
to a monetary policy shock which is given by an increase of about 1.0 p.p. in the Selic interest
rate7. The length of the responses is equal to 20 periods for all graphics. Real GDP decreases

gradually until the second period after the shock when reaches a negative variation equal to
0.4%, then the shock tends to slowly dissipate. Inﬂation rate increases in the ﬁrst period after
the shock, then gradually decreases until the seventh period, after this it tends to back to the
baseline. The ﬁrst movement of inﬂation reﬂects the price-puzzle despite of the explicit
introduction of the inﬂation of the commodities price. Nominal wage inﬂation also presents
an positive variation in the ﬁrst period after the shock but the conﬁdence interval includes
negative values. Finally, loan rate behaves very similar to Selic8.

It is worth to stress that the variable dynamics is similar to that one reported by Hülsewig
et al. (2009) in a study for euro area in the case of real GDP, inﬂation and interest rates. There
is a difference in the behaviour of the nominal wage inﬂation that, in the referred study, do
not increase in the ﬁrst period after the shock.

intervals of the bootstrapped impulse-responses

A subset of the model parameters was calibrated based on empirical evidences obtained
from Brazilian economy informations. The calibrated values are also in line with the values
used by other studies e.g. Christiano et al. (2005), Smets and Wouters (2003), Smets and
Wouters (2007), Rabanal and Rubio-Ramírez (2007), Hülsewig et al. (2009), Vereda and Cav-
alcanti (2010), Cavalcanti and Vereda (2011), Carvalho and Valli (2011) and Vasconcelos and
Divino (2012), the last four are speciﬁc to Brazil. Tabel 1 show the used values. Discount
factor β is equal to 0.99 which implies that the steady-state real interest rate is equal to 4%
in a quartely model. The utility function elasticities σ and η are equal to 2. The share of
capital in the output (α) is ﬁxed to 0.3. Depreciation rate (δ) is equal to 0.025 which implies
an annual depreciation of capital equal to 10%. The parameters φ and  are equal to 11, im-
plying steady-state mark-ups of prices and wages equal to 10% in the steady-state. Capital

and Luís Inácio Lula da Silva and 0 otherwise. The second dummy is equal to 1 in 2002:2 and 0 otherwise to
deal with an outlier in nominal wage inﬂation data that is a result of a methodology change of the research.
Finally, the third dummy is 1 in 2008:4 and 2009:1 that is the peak of the effects of the last ﬁnancial crisis in
Brazil and 0 otherwise. We perform VAR model speciﬁcation tests, the results of these tests are in the appendix.
8Once we consider the commodities price only as a control variable, its response was not reported in the
ﬁgure 1. As robustness analysis, the VAR model was estimated considering the commodities price as an
exogenous variable. The results were basically the same.

utilization elasticity ψ is set to 100. Finally, τ2 is equal to 0.4, implying that the proportion of
the banks that operate directed credit is 40% which is roughly the average proportion of the
volume of this modality of credit in Brazil during 2013.

The remaining parameter of the model is estimated by the minimization of the distance
between the empirical and theoretical impulse-response functions. Figure 2 show the result
of this approximation procedure. The estimated model seems to be able to replicate the data
once the theoretical impulse-response functions lie inside the empirical conﬁdence interval.
Table 2 shows the estimates obtained to the parameters in vector  and their respective
standard deviation values. The degree of habit formation in consumption (h) is equal to
0.99, implying that the consumption response to a monetary policy is strongly driven by the
habits and the policy has a tiny direct effect. This value is greater than the values reported
in other studies for Brazilian economy e.g. Carvalho and Valli (2011) and Vasconcelos and
Divino (2012) that estimated something around 0.6, however it is more close to the 0.825
used by Vereda and Cavalcanti (2010).
The estimate of the adjustment cost of investiment ( ¯S(cid:48)(cid:48)) is 2.44. This value is close to the

2.35 estimated by Carvalho and Valli (2011) for Brazilian economy.

The results also indicate a low degree of price rigidity. Parameter θp is equal to 0.18. On
the other hand, the share of the ﬁrms that adopt the indexation rule (ωp) is signiﬁcant being
equal to 0.35.

Wage rigidity is high. The estimate of θw and ωw are equal to 0.98 and 0.80 respectively.
These results are in line with Vereda and Cavalcanti (2010), Cavalcanti and Vereda (2011),
Carvalho and Valli (2011) e Vasconcelos and Divino (2012).

There is no strong evidence of incomplete interest rate pass-through once the parameter
τ1 is equal to 0.36 i.e. 36% of the free credit banks cannot re-adjust their loan rates. Therefore,
the ﬁnancial market shows a low degree of rigidity in Brazil.

The result for parameter ν is an evidence for the relevance of the channel cost of monetary
policy. This parameter is equal to 1.00 i.e. 100% of the ﬁrms depend on bank lending to
ﬁnance the production and, consequently, an increase of the interest rate promotes in an
increase of the production costs.

Finally, the estimates for the Taylor rule parameter are the following: inﬂation coefﬁcient
(µπ) is equal to 1.05, output gap coefﬁcient (µ ˆY ) is 0.02, growth rate of the output gap coef-
ﬁcient (µ∆ ˆY ) is 0.68 and the degree of interest rate smoothing that is given by the difference
between the autorregressive coefﬁcients (µ1 and µ2) is equal to 0.749.

9The smoothing degree value is similar to the ones estimated by Vereda and Cavalcanti (2010), Cavalcanti

and Vereda (2011), Carvalho and Valli (2011) e Vasconcelos and Divino (2012).

4.2 Scenarios Analysis
We equal the proportion of ﬁrms that depends on credit to ﬁnance the production to zero
(ν = 0) in order to analyze the relevance of the cost channel. The other parameters of the
model still with the values previously estimated. Figure 3 shows the effects of this modiﬁ-
cation in terms of the responses of the variables to a monetary policy shock. Marginal costs

13

and inﬂation do not increase after a monetary policy shock immediately after the shock
when ν = 0. It is not possible to notice by ﬁgure 3 that inﬂation in fact decreases a little
since the ﬁrst period after the shock. The behaviour of the inﬂation is better depicted by
ﬁgure 4. This is an evidence that the cost channel plays a relevant role in the transmission
of the monetary policy in Brazil, helping to explain the price-puzzle observed in the VAR
model estimation. This result corroborates with Martins (2011), for Brazilian economy, and
the empirical evidence of other studies e.g. Barth and Ramey (2002), Gaiotti and Secchi
(2006), Christiano et al. (2005), Ravenna and Walsh (2006), Chowdhury et al. (2006), Till-
mann (2008), Hülsewig et al. (2009). On the other hand, the response of the GDP does not
present a signiﬁcant change, implying, in this case, that the monetary policy works by the
demand side.

Figure 3: Monetary policy shock without Cost Channel

Note: Solid lines denote the responses of the model considering ν = 1.00 and the marked lines denote the
responses of the model considering ν = 0.

Figure 4: Inﬂation Response to a Monetary Policy Shock without Cost Channel

Figure 5 presents the model variable responses to a monetary policy shock in a scenario
of complete interest rate pass-through (τ1 = 0). The modiﬁcation in the value of τ1 doesn’t
change the response of any variable signiﬁcantly, except the loan rate that in this scenario
respond the shock in the same intensity of the Selic. Therefore, it seems that there is no
rigidity in the ﬁnancial market in Brazil, at least in terms of free credit.

14

Figure 5: Monetary Policy Shock with Complete Interest Rate Pass-Through

Note: Solid lines denote the responses of the model considering τ1 = 0.36 and the marked lines denote the
responses of the model considering τ1 = 0.

Figure 6 shows the responses of the variables to a monetary policy shock in a scenario in
which there is no directed credit (τ2 = 0). The responses of real GDP, investment, inﬂation,
nominal wage inﬂation, marginal costs and rental rate are intensiﬁed. This result indicates
that the higher is the directed credit share, the lower is the inﬂuence of the monetary policy.
Again, the consumption response don’t change substantially, implying that its dynamics is
mostly determined by habit formation.

Considering that there is no evidence of limited interest rate pass-through, at lower levels
of directed credit share, the monetary policy potentializes its effect on the credit conditions
because the free credit loan rate becomes more representative. More speciﬁcally, A contrac-
tionary monetary policy given by an increase in the interest rate promotes a more signiﬁcant
increase in the loan rate. Then, the effect of the monetary policy in the ﬁnancial costs of the
ﬁrms will also be intensiﬁed, increasing consequently the price-puzzle.

This result corroborates the ﬁndings of Sato (2013) and Santin (2013). According to Sato
(2013), the monetary policy promotes signiﬁcant change in the supply of credit in Brazil but
the impact of the credit conditions on production is reduced. To Santin (2013), the force of
the monetary policy decreases with the adoption of credit policies, specially, the inﬂation
rigidity becomes higher.

5 Conclusions

We aimed to analyze the cost channel of monetary policy in Brazil, highlighting the role
played by the banks. For that, we developed a DSGE New-Keynesian model in which: the
aggregate loan rate directly inﬂuences the cost of the ﬁrms; the interest rate pass-through
may be limited; and, part of the loans is made by directed credit.

We estimate the model for Brazilian economy by using the Minimum Distance approach.
The results indicated that: there is a high level of price rigidity; there is no evidence of
interest rate incomplete pass-through; the cost channel is relevant to explain the inﬂation
dynamics (and the price-puzzle) after a monetary policy shock; and, the directed credit par-
ticipation reduces the monetary policy capacity of modifying the credit conditions.
