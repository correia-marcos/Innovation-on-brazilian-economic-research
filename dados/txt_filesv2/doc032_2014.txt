Abstract: We consider tax implementation on external capital flows to Brazil, in a monthly basis, since 
2007,  aiming  to  identify  significant  effects  of  changes  on  tax  legislation  over  the  pattern  of  financial 
flows from abroad. Using univariate structural models, results show IOF has introduced a structural break 
on foreign portfolio investment inflows.

External capital flows’ management in the great recession: the Brazilian experience (2007-2013) 

 
 
Introduction 
 
Even  though  mainstream  economists  usually  agree  that  there  are  substantial  benefits  from 
international financial integration, the extension by which countries open their capital accounts to external 
capital  flows  still  remains  a  controversial  question  (Arestis  and  De  Paula,  2008;  Claessens  and  Kose, 
2013; Rey, 2013; Wolfson and Epstein, 2013). The cyclicality and the volatility of the flows rise concerns 
regarding  the  macroeconomic  stability  and  the  potential  impacts  on  the  development  of  the  receiving 
economies.  As  a  consequence,  and  with  more  emphasis  during  the  so-called  “great  recession”, 
policymakers started revising the adopted instruments to manage the potentially destabilizing flows on 
emerging economies (Ostry et al., 2010, 2011; Cynamon, Fazzari, Setterfield, 2013; Gallagher, 2014).  

The post 2007/2008 crisis period has raised active monetary policies on advanced countries as a 
way to avoid recession in their economies, with the “currency wars” and “monetary tsunamis” being part 
of the global economic agenda. Likewise, external capital flows have constituted a relevant preoccupation 
not  only  on  emerging  economies  but  also  on  the  developed  ones  (such  as  Japan,  by  the  effect  on  the 
competitiveness of its manufacturing sector, and Switzerland, by the inflation bias), notwithstanding with 
the volatility of the exchange rate and its effects on the real economy. The response of the economies to 
the instabilities of the capital flows is not consensual, with each country developing their own domestic 
solutions, adapted to their very realities (IMF, 2012; Akerlof et al., 2014; Eichengreen and Rose, 2014). 
 
Brazil  has  not  been  an  exception  in  this  scenario.  The  recent  years  have  given  rise  to  a  more 
energetic action of the central government, through the Ministry of Finance, on the managing of capital 
flows. In particular, a market friendly tradition has been developed with the application of the so called 
“Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras” (IOF), which is a tax on financial transaction, as a prudential 
measure to reduce the volatility of the capital flows and restrain the spillovers identified on the economy. 
According  to  Olivier  (2011),  Brazil  is  one  of  the  most  active  countries,  after  the  2007/2008  crisis, 
regarding  the  adoption  of  measures  to  control  capital  flows.  The  policies  effects,  nevertheless,  are  a 
matter of discussion on the literature, with many researchers pondering what would be the best policy to 
be  adopted  (Goldfajn  and  Minella,  2005;  Carvalho  and  Sicsú,  2007;  Carvalho  and  Garcia,  2008;  De 
Paula,  2010;  Jinjarak,  Noy,  Zheng,  2013;  Chamon  and  Garcia,  2013).  The  effectiveness  of  the  use  of 
capital  control  has  been  a  controversial  matter;  therefore  further  studies  on  the  subject  should  be 
welcomed. 
 
This  research  is  embedded  in  this  context  and  wishes  to  contribute  in  the  debate  in  two  main 
aspects: (i) we long to identify the edited macroprudential measures, based on the IOF, considering that 
the underlying period witnessed the destabilising effects of financial cycles (Borio, 2012), when Brazil 
had  to  deal  with  both  excess  of  external  capital  inflows  and  sudden  stops;  (ii)  from  them  test  the 
effectiveness of the capital controls in Brazil, using monthly data from January 2007 to December 2013. 
Using the methodology of state space time series analysis, we have found that capital controls through 
IOF were effective, meaning that it has introduced a structural break on capital inflows series. 
 
 
2. Revision of the Literature: theory and empiric evidence 
 
The regulation of capital flows is a subject that has been constantly revisited. Tobin (1978) long 
ago already defended that a global tax on foreign currency transactions would reduce the destabilizing 
speculation  on  international  financial  markets.  Recently,  since  the  2000’s,  the  discussions  have  been 
focused on the use of punctual restrictions on the mobility of capitals in emerging countries, dealing with 
issues  such  as  optimal  mobility  degree,  relation  with  economic  growth,  and  the  effectiveness  of  the 
managing of capital flows (IMF, 2012). After the 2007/2008 financial crisis, interest in capital controls 
has suddenly become fashionable again, now as part of the so-called macroprudential policies (Akerlof et 
al., 2014).  

During  the  30  years  period  while  countries  moved  towards  a  globalized  financial  market,  we 
verified a paramount of different perspectives and experiences in the managing of capital flows in the 

 
 

receiving  economies.  We  are  talking  about  a  technical  regulation,  but  there  is  no  systematization  or 
unified  international  rule  to  be  followed  by  countries;  some  measures  may  be  suitable  under  certain 
circumstances,  while  others  may  not.  IMF  (2011,  2012)  has  been  trying  to  advise  a  pattern  of 
characteristics for optimal international regulation policies on capital accounts. The same has also been 
suggested by Olivier (2011). The objective is to be a framework of rules to orientate countries on how to 
deal with the capital flows. The capital flows control measures are suggested for specific situations, such 
as when the exchange rate is undervalued, and when the economies are overheated and there is no room 
for tightening fiscal policies (IMF, 2011). In the same way as for international trade, the recommended, if 
needed, would be transparent measures as anti-cyclical taxes over certain kinds of capital flows, seeking 
financial stability; topic that has gained more attention after the 2007/2008 economic crisis. However, the 
international financial framework rules out the adoption of a unified international measure on the matter, 
with countries not being able to reach an agreement on how to regulate the financial flows, what recalls 
the discussion on the post-war period at Bretton Woods (IMF, 2012; Wolfson and Epstein, 2013; Akerlof 
et al., 2014).  
According to what Griffth-Jones, Ocampo and Stiglitz (2010), Blanchard et al. (2012), Gallagher 
 
(2014), among others, suggest, the 2007/2008 crisis recalled the need for a regulation on financial flows, 
with the adoption of prudential measures, correcting distortions created under the laissez-faire policies. 
Korinek (2011), for instance, suggests that there are spillovers related to financial crisis due to the fact 
that market agents do not internalize their contribution to financial instability upon taking decisions on 
resource  allocation  or  debt  collection  in  the  short  term,  generating  excessive  risk  taking.  In  this  case, 
prudential  capital  controls  may  lead  to  the  internalization  of  costs  and  to  increasing  macroeconomic 
stability and economic well-fare. 
 
The empiric literature on the subject faces the heterogeneity of time-frames and samples on the 
research works, besides the multiple definitions on what constitutes the effectiveness, not to mention the 
lack of a common methodology. Anyway, the rationale subjacent to capital controls encompasses what 
academics refer to as “four fears”: the fear of currency appreciation; the fear of hot money; the fear of 
excessive inflows; and the fear of the loosening of monetary autonomy. Insofar, capital controls would 
aim to reduce the volume of capital flows or change its composition (aiming towards a longer maturity), 
reducing pressure on the real exchange rate and allowing a higher degree of autonomy to the monetary 
policy. Baba and Kokenyne (2011) suggest that the macroeconomic impact of capital controls must be 
assessed under its capacity to achieve four basic objectives: contain capital flows; widen the maturity of 
inflows;  reduce  the  appreciative  pressure  on  the  exchange  rate;  and  grant  more  autonomy  to  the 
calibration of interest rates on the monetary policy.  
 
Assessing the efficiency of the controls, Schneider (2000) suggests that they may be effective on 
influencing  the  composition  of  capital  inflows,  granting  better  external  managing  conditions  to  the 
emerging economies, in the short and medium terms. The quarantine experience upon the Chilean capital 
inflows  in  the  1990’s  is  usually  considered  to  be  effective,  being  frequently  mentioned  in  scientific 
researches. Magud and Reinhart (2007), in their survey, concluded that the capital inflow controls do not 
reduce  the  volume  of  liquid  capital  flows  in  a  given  economy,  questioning  the  effectiveness  of  that 
measure, but acknowledging that they produce a modification in the nature and composition of the capital 
flows. Qureshi et al. (2011) examined the contribution of capital controls to the increasing of financial 
stability  in  the  context  of  large  capital  inflows,  analysing  51  emerging  economies  in  the  1995-2008 
period. They associated capital controls to a lower proportion of foreign currency loans in relation to the 
total  domestic  bank  credit,  and  to  a  lower  proportion  of  portfolio  debt  in  relation  to  the  total  external 
obligations.  
 
Magud, Reinhart and Rogoff (2011) indicated several evidences that capital controls are effective, 
at  least,  in  the  short  term.  Their  extensive  analysis  shows  that  capital  controls  over  capital  inflows 
increase the autonomy of the central bank, change the composition of the capital flows and reduce, to 
some extent, the pressures over the real exchange rate. However, the impact on the long term appears to 
be a more controversial question, with some researches emphasizing temporary effectiveness on capital 
flows  and  asset  prices,  while  others  suggesting  that  capital  controls  are  harmful  to  the  increase  of  the 
well-fare  state  in  the  long-term  (Magud,  Reinhart  and  Rogoff,  2011;  Blanchard  et  al.,  2012). 

Nevertheless, at first, these authors agree that it is possible to guarantee the capital controls effectiveness 
with  the  monitoring  and  regulation  of  markets  with  some  compliance  cost.  Moreover,  there  would  be 
idiosyncratic characteristics in each economy that would determine the effectiveness of capital controls, 
what  would  explain  why  some  capital  control  experiences  were  effective  while  others  were  not. 
Therefore,  the  positive  experience  in  a  given  economy  is  not  emulatable  to  another  economy  without 
considering the specific particularities of each economy (Wolfson and Epstein, 2013). 
 
Likewise,  IMF  (2011a,  2012)  shows  recent  cases  of  adoption  of  capital  flows  in  emerging 
economies. The effects of the policies adopted by Brazil and other six emerging economies (Indonesia, 
South Korea, Peru, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey) are analysed in episodes of the augmentation of 
the foreign exchange capital. According to the IMF (2011a), the rapid economic growth after the global 
crisis, added to the high interest rates, made Brazil one of the preferred destinies to capital flows among 
emerging  markets.  The  organization  understands  that  the  IOF  had  an  impact  on  the  contention  of 
speculative  capital  flows  in  the  short  term,  possibly  due  to  the  high  levels  of  uncertainty  over  other 
measures  it  may  have  potentially  generated  and  that  may  have  affected  the  composition  of  the  capital 
flows.  

However, the IMF (2011a, 2012) did not identify impacts on the long-term, due to the fact that the 
introduction of the IOF did not provoke a significant reduction on the activity of non-residents on future 
markets. Likewise, it did not identify a clear and long-lasting effect over the exchange rate, and stressed 
the necessity of the authorities considering the dollars future market upon defining the tax, that only in 
2011 went under taxation through the IOF (decree 7.563/11). Baba and Kokenyne (2011), on the other 
hand, assessed the effectiveness of the capital controls on a group of emerging countries in the 2000’s, 
including  Brazil;  they  conclude  that  the  capital  controls  are  usually  associated  to  a  decreasing  in  the 
capital inflows and to a widening of the maturation deadlines, even though the effects may be temporary. 
In order to do so, they build a de jure index observing the normative modifications on the capital flows on 
a  monthly  basis,  using  the  methodology  proposed  by  Van  der  Laan  et  al.  (2010)  in  evaluating  the 
normative changes exposed in the IMF AREAER.  
Forbes et al. (2012) presented another interesting research to evaluate the effectiveness of the IOF 
 
on foreign flows of portfolio. The research used changes on the IOF taxation over the foreign investors in 
Brazil from 2006 to 2011 to assess the multilateral effects of capital controls in the global portfolio flows. 
Taking  into  account  information  provided  by  several  global  investors,  the  research  concludes  that  the 
increase in capital controls in Brazil led international investors to reduce the allocation of portfolio in the 
country, denoting, therefore, the effectiveness of the regulation. More specifically, an increase in the IOF 
reduces significantly the percentage of the fixed and variable income portfolios allocated in Brazil, even 
though that this reallocation does not happen instantaneously, or even in the month of the announcement 
of  the  changes.  The  researchers  identify  that  the  process  occurs  gradually  in  a  period  of  around  three 
months. Moreover, an increase in the IOF may reduce smoothly the risk of the formation of bubbles and 
overheating of the stock market, what seems to be the case in Brazil; this conclusion is easily derived 
while  observing  the  tamed  capital  flows  and  the  lower  financial  turbulence,  for  instance,  during  the 
beginning of the second part of the international financial crisis in August 2011. In fact, the controls may 
reduce the portfolio flows and, therefore, potentially help the management of risks originated from inflow 
waves. 
 
Simultaneously,  investors  would  decrease  their  portfolio  allocation  to  other  countries  with  the 
probability of using controls (that would be encouraged to adopt similar managing policies, ahead of the 
experience  of  other  economy  with  similar  external  projection).  This  denotes  that  the  government’s 
signalization in this way, and the expectation originated from the market, constitutes an important channel 
to the effectiveness of the regulation, accepting rational expectations. At the same time, a positive effect 
is the reallocation of capital to countries with a certain similarity with Brazil, should it be in the same 
geographic region, should it be with a similar external economic approach, constituting a substitute for 
the risk diversification in a global portfolio. Therefore, the results suggest that a big part of the capital 
controls over portfolio flows happens through signalization, instead of the direct cost originated from the 
controls already implemented.  

 
Baumann  and  Gallagher  (2012)  examine  the  effectiveness  of  the  capital  regulation  in  Brazil 
(basically the IOF) and, not deviating from the literature, they find a small, though significant, impact on 
the  change  of  the  composition  of  the  capital  inflows  in  the  direction  of  an  investment  with  a  longer 
maturation, on the level and volatility of the exchange rate, on the price of assets, and on the ability of the 
country to implement an autonomous monetary policy. They also conclude that the Brazilian regulation 
temporarily  had  an  outcome  that  increased  the  capital  flows  to  Chile.  Therefore,  they  indicate  that 
adopted measures helped the economy to face the turbulence of the external situation, even though they 
were not enough to control the monetary “tsunami”. 
In Brazil, in fact, very few researches were made with a specific focus on the efficiency of the 
 
capital controls under an IOF taxation bias. The tradition, actually, was developed under the analysis of 
the Central Bank’s legislation on capital account flows, narrowing or not determining the kind of inflow 
or  financial  remittance,  with  main  focus  on  the  effects  of  the  reduction  on  the  capital  controls  on  the 
growing of the domestic economy. The subject gathered research interest especially after the publications 
of Arida (2003a, 2003b) and Arida, Bacha and Lara-Resende (2003), that proposed full convertibility of 
the capital account, by means of the withdrawal of the capital controls from the Central Bank. The full 
convertibility  would  eliminate  the  risk  of  currency  convertibility  related  to  the  capital  controls 
discretionary  of  the  Central  Bank  from  the  international  transactions  (the  so  called  “jurisdictional 
insecurity”  of  the  country),  what  would  reduce  significantly  the  sovereign  risk  –  in  its  conception, 
substantially high –, and the domestic interest rate, finally promoting growth. A series of posterior works, 
such as Oreiro, Paula e Silva (2004), for instance, proposed a partial convertibility regime in the country, 
that  should  still  adopt  a  more  precautional  strategy  on  the  managing  of  international  financial  flows, 
including the (re)introduction of selective controls on the capital account. The same idea is inferred by 
Ono et al. (2005), Sicsú (2007), De Paula (2010), among others, such as Munhoz and Libânio (2010), 
pointing out the necessity to reduce the speculative bias of the international capital flows, suggesting that 
the benefits of the controls would overcome the costs.  
 
Carvalho  and  Garcia  (2008)  also  used  a  VAR  model,  assessing  that  the  effectiveness  of  the 
Central Bank regulations on the country may last for (only) six months, being therefore ineffective from 
then  on,  what  took  them  to  conclude  that  these  regulations  are  ineffective  in  the  long-term.  However, 
given that the VAR technique only generates simulations of temporary shocks decreasing in the short-
term, so this conclusion should be relativized. The response of an innovation shock in one of the model 
equations necessarily decreases over time; otherwise, the model would be unstable and not stationary (see 
Patterson,  2000,  p.  601).  The  shocks  of  transitory  nature  in  the  model  do  not  show  an  evidence  of 
inefficiency on the capital controls. The relevant result is the acknowledgement of the efficiency of the 
controls in the short-term, as showed in the model. Previously, the VAR model of Cardoso and Goldfajn 
(1998) identified that the tightness on the control of capitals is effective in short term, granting conditions 
to the emerging countries to breath in spite of the external financial turbulences, avoiding the sudden and 
massive departure of capital. In other words, the volume and the composition of the capital flows respond 
to restrictive measures. In the same way, Carvalho e Sicsú (2007, cap. 7) suggest that the capital controls 
were already adopted with success in several countries, while Goldfajn e Minella (2005) point out that 
control over the capital inflows affect the volume and the composition of the flows in Brazil, implicitly 
recognizing the effectiveness of the Central Bank’s actions. 

Munhoz (2013) focus specifically upon the effectiveness of the IOF. Using a VAR model, results 
suggest that the speculative financial flows respond in a small degree to small alterations in the aliquot of 
this interest. Due to a low efficiency, in her point of view, of the capital controls through IOF, the author 
remarks the necessity of more concrete measures that would evade effectively the speculation of foreign 
investors and the consequent destabilizing effect of the financial flows in Brazil. However, we suggested 
that  the  used  methodology  may  have  a  few  problems,  starting  by  the  variable  used  as  proxy  for  the 
modelling of the IOF. The author uses the collection of IOF on foreign exchange operations to gather the 
alterations  on  the  IOF  aliquot.  Therefore,  she  assumes  the  inelasticity  of  the  capital  flows  against  the 
increase of the IOF, contradicting evidence that there is a change in the composition of the capital flows. 
Moreover, the collection of IOF used encompasses all the foreign exchange operations, while the IOF was 
applied on a few kinds of inflows, not representing therefore all the variations. The primary attempt to 

modelling only the capital controls, using the IOF collection over all the foreign exchange operations to 
gather the IOF alterations on the specific flows does not seem to be adequate. 
 
Besides not having the collection only for the short-term flows (portfolio-stock market), the focus 
of her study, the author suggests that the increase on the IOF generates an augmentation in the collection, 
as if the flows did not fall, in contradiction with the reality. The meaning of the supposedly direct relation 
(sic) between the collection of IOF and the increase in the aliquot also does not seem to be correct, ahead 
of the reduction of the inflows in a context of rising of taxes. At the same time, she uses only the time 
series  for  portfolio  investments,  for  instance,  but  deduces  conclusions  for  time  series  with  no  direct 
relation  with  it.  Even  the  proxy  shows  constancy  in  the  collection  of  IOF  from  1995  to  2008,  not 
identifying the variations in the controls that actually happened in this wide time-frame. A preliminary 
methodological approach would be to use the own IOF aliquot as a more appropriate indicator for the use 
of capital controls, and, therefore, for the analysis of the process of capital controls – however, the most 
adequate would be to follow the tradition inaugurated by Cardoso and Goldfajn (1998).  

However,  as  the  author  stresses,  “there  is  no  data  availability  about  the  IOF  aliquot  in  a 
systematized  way,  making  the  analysis  more  difficult”  (Munhoz,  2013)  –  what  grants  room  for  the 
economic research, in the forms proposed in this article, as a way to systematize all data about the IOF 
modifications. This is the original contribution of this research. Other series of modelling problems, such 
as the selection of series, the use of net flows instead of total flows or  inflows (over which the IOF is 
applied),  ignoring  all  flows  upon  which    IOF  is  applied,  apart  from  using  data  in  a  monthly  basis 
(available), also potentially jeopardizes the conclusive potential of Munhoz’s (2013) efforts. Therefore, 
using the balance of portfolio investments as if they were flows (incomes and outcomes) of a country with 
abroad, neither the IOF modifications nor the flows were modelled. It would be similar to taking the trade 
balance result, of USD 2.5 billion in 2013, and not the sum of import and export total turnover, which 
accounted for more than USD 480 billion and is the real flow to be controlled. The most interesting part 
was  the  conclusion  of  the  IOF  ineffectiveness  with  the  simultaneous suggestion  of  a  increasing  of  the 
aliquots of the tax.  
The endogeneity of the capital controls is also a relevant matter. Henry (2006) stresses that the 
 
current  and  prospective  performance  of  a  given  economy  influences  the  extent  to  which  policymakers 
decide  to  manage  the  capital  controls;  the  same  capital  controls  endogeneity  idea,  of  Cardoso  and 
Goldfajn (1998), is corroborated by Soihet (2002) and Paula, Oreiro and Silva (2003), in the sense that 
capital  controls  are  more  or  less  restrictive  considering  the  performance  of  the  capital  flows.  In  other 
words,  the  endogeneity  of  the  capital  flows  plays  a  role  of  reaction  of  the  monetary  authorities  in  the 
external managing of the economy, given the volatility of the autonomous capital flows. Collins (2007) 
also  concludes  that  the  capital  controls  seem  to  be  endogenous  in  regressions  modelling  growth  time 
series. Silva and Resende (2009) conclude that the capital controls in Brazil were indeed endogenous and 
effective in avoiding a significant part of the capital drain in the 1990’s.  
 
In  this  context,  it  is  important  to  observe  the  schedule  of  the  panel  of  restrictive  measures 
implemented  by  the  Central  Bank,  easily  concluding  that  they  usually  derive  from  an  unfavourable 
external situation, being revoked afterwards. Usually the capital controls are applied upon the entrance of 
foreign funds and done fundamentally through the charging of IOF on the gains of financial investments 
in  the  country,  creating  a  tradition  to  use  market-friendly  instruments  in  the  managing  of  flows.  One 
advantage is the familiarity that the government has to control capital flows allowing a better calibration 
of the IOF tax rate, given the knowledge accumulated through previous experiences. It also allows the 
financial  system  to  introduce  new  measures  more  easily,  which  are  also  better  assimilated  by  the 
economic  agents  (Ostry  et  al.,  2010).  This  creates  an  environment  with  more  “jurisdictional  safety”, 
according  to  Arida,  Bacha  and  Lara-Resende  (2003)  with  the  advantage  of  the  IOF  being  a  market 
instrument, not prohibiting the capital flows, but creating a directional incentive to guide them, applied on 
the capital inflows. Moreover, the capital controls tradition in Brazil has focused only on portfolio flows, 
not affecting the foreign direct investment (FDI) transactions, only recently being applied also on foreign 
loans, suggesting that the focus is the volatility of short-term flows. In this way, external flows tend to 
determine the level of capital controls, instead of them being determined by the level of controls. 

in  2008-2011.  Using 

the  synthetic  control  method, 

 
Finally,  Barroso  (2012)  makes  a  preliminary  effort  to  estimate  an  optimal  level  of  taxes  to  be 
charged over the capital inflow, with a 17 Latin-American economies database, for the 1970-2007 period, 
trying to anticipate crises caused by sudden economy turnovers. The author identifies as most relevant 
conditioning factors to the taxation of capital flows the agent’s degree of aversion to international risk, the 
international  liquid  position  of  assets,  the  level  of  international  foreign  exchange  reserves  (which 
minimize the incidence and extent of economic crises) and the index of exchange rate over evaluation. 
His estimation suggests that taxes charged over the capital flows should be proportional to the square root 
of the probability of and external crisis. In this case, if we have a 10% increase in the probability of a 
crisis, there should be an additional increase of 1% over the taxes of capital flows to become an optimal 
taxation. This suggests that the currents IOF taxation levels, which may represent more than 6% of the 
flows, would be too high of a level and implicitly unnecessary. Implicitly, despite of this conclusion, the 
author still recognizes the effectiveness of the capital controls. 
More recently, Jinjarak, Noy, and Huanhuan Zheng (2013) analysed five changes in the Brazilian 
 
capital  account  regime 
they  constructed 
counterfactuals (i.e., Brazil with no policy change) and concluded that there was no evidence that any 
tightening of controls was effective in reducing the magnitudes of capital inflows. Nevertheless, authors 
suggested  that  capital  controls  had  some  short-lived  success  in  preventing  further  declines  in  inflows 
when restrictions were relaxed. 
 
Chamon and Garcia (2013) studied the impact of the controls and restrictions on capital inflows 
that  Brazil  has  adopted  since  late  2009.  Their  results  suggested  that  the  controls  were  effective  in  the 
sense of creating distortions in the pricing of financial assets, making the domestic assets more expensive. 
As a consequence, controls were effective in partially segmenting the Brazilian financial market from the 
international  market.  Nevertheless,  they  also  concluded  that  the  controls  were  not  able  to  avoid  the 
volatility of the domestic currency when capital inflows were strong, which would be an important goal 
objective of the Brazilian authorities. 
 
3. Recent measures and the direct effects on the exchange rate flow 
 
The compilation of IOF’s aliquot variations focused in studying the decrees edited in the post-
2007  period,  available  in  the  Brazilian  Ministry  of Finance’s  website.  Other  legislation  instruments  of 
inferior  hierarchy  were  not  considered,  such  as  resolutions  or  administrative  measures,  as  they  do  not 
issue  new  IOF  aliquots,  only  regulating  the  tax  collection  or  clearing  ambiguous  points  regarding  the 
application and incidence of the tax. The IOF, originally established in 1993, has been used eminently as 
an economic policy instrument, and with a revenue bias only on the back burner.  
 
Recently,  the  IOF  collection  in  foreign  exchange  operations  has  been  more  active.  Apart  from 
substituting  the  CPMF1,  extinguished  in  late  2007,  the  IOF  gained  room  in  the  regulation  of  foreign 
exchange flows after the issuing of a new basic regulation through the decree 6.306 in Dec, 2007, which 
came to substitute its predecessor, decree 4.494, from 2002. In this interlude, there was no modification of 
the IOF application over foreign exchange operations, apart from the edition of the decree 5.172, in 2004, 
which only changed aliquots for the insurance operations.  
 
Lately, the IOF has been a key-tool to the capital controls. The Ministry of Finance has been more 
active ahead of the international financial market’s turbulence and has been adopting measures to fight 
the  “currency  wars”,  to  restrain  the  money  inflow  or  the  “monetary  tsunami”  coming  from  developed 
countries that have low interest rates (sometimes even negative) and have increased the money supply to 
heat up their economies after the 2008 economic crisis.  
 
As foreign capitals returned to Brazil after the sudden reversal in 2008, Brazil introduced the IOF 
on capital inflows in October 2009, initially under a 1.5% aliquot, but soon increasing it to 2%, charged 
on every foreign capital inflow but the FDI. The easiness of its implementation is related to the fact that 
the  Central  Bank’s  electronic  registration  systems  of  financial  operations  allow  easy  distinction  of  the 
                                                            
1 “Contribuição Provisória sobre a Movimentação ou Transmissão de Valores e de Créditos e Direitos de Natureza Financeira’ (CPMF) was 
another tax on financial transaction, imposed on any removal of funds from bank accounts maintained in Brazil, in order to improve tax 
collection from the central government. 

flows  in  relation  to  current  account  or  FDI  transactions,  constituting    a  reason  for  its  success  As  the 
aliquot is not proportional to the amount of time capitals remain invested in Brazilian assets, the implicit 
tax  rate  was  relatively  lower  to  longer  term  inflows;  the  same  happens  to  repeatedly  rolled  short-term 
assets,  however  economically  derailing  short-term  operations.  In  other  words,  a  disincentive  has  been 
imposed,  via  taxation,  for  foreigners  to  invest  short  term  in  Brazil,  at  the  same  time  spuring  them  to 
remain with domestic assets for longer periods. This is now new, and one may consider it follows the 
same logic of the well-known Chilean quarantine of the 1990’s. 
 
A  first  step  to  evaluate  the  use  of  IOF  in  Brazil  is  to  identify  each  normative  measure  issued 
during the analysed time-frame, just as its effects on the capital flows. We choose as a time-frame the 
Brazilian  experience  the  recent  period  in  which  the  capital  controls  through  the  IOF  were  used  more 
intensely. In fact, the decree 6.306/07 is the basic legislation of the IOF that substituted previous law from 
2004,  but  with  no  modifications  on  the  aliquots  applied  on  foreign  exchange  operations.  Table  1 
summarizes the main modifications upon foreign capital inflows. Basically, we may observe that the IOF 
was  applied  on  two  basic  kinds  of  foreign  capital  inflows:  loans  and  foreign  investment  in  portfolio 
(stocks or fixed income), with foreign direct investment (FDI) remaining tax-free.

portfolio-guarantee margin directed to derivatives market, though not consider in this paper due to its small relevance 
to capital flows. 

 
 
The  effectiveness  of  the  IOF  may  be  evaluated  observing  the  response  of  the  flows  after  each 
aliquot change. A clear IOF effect on stocks-driven portfolio inflows is noticed in the monthly average 
volume of the foreign investments directed to the stock market. As may be seen, the period registered the 
rising  and  decreasing  of  IOF  over  external  inflows.  Figure  1  shows  that  IOF  has  been  imposed  in 
September, 2009, with the return of portfolio inflows to stocks in 2009, while in December of 2011 it has 
been zeroed, as portfolio inflows came to a halt. In fact, after the decree 7632 issued on December, 2011 
has  eliminated  the  IOF,  the  monthly  average  increased  from  less  than  USD  7  billion  (in  the  past  12 
months) to USD 12 billion, a 68.6% increase.

Excessive flows directed to funding the public deficit (fixed-income) have led the Government to 
impose IOF in two main periods. Firstly in the first semester of 2008, but soon reverted in September due 
to the crisis drying the local forex market; and later in 2009-2010 gradually achieving 6%, reverted only 
in June, 2013, with the cease of the foreign tide (figure 2).

In fact, the foreign exchange flow becomes of better quality, for instance in 2011, in the sense of 
being less volatile than in 2008, when the reversion of the capital flows started to deepen the situation of 
stoppage of new inflows. This means less cyclic reversion potential: exportations and FDI receive more 
attention, ahead of the contention on stock-portfolio flows. In 2011, the FDI had record inflows inside the 
researched time-frame, and the same happened to the exportations, which are more resilient flows and 
less  prone  to  sudden  reversions.  They  are  less  volatile  flows  that  usually  offer  less  pressure  to  the 
domestic foreign exchange market ahead of external crisis. At the same time, in 2011, the more volatile 
flows  of  portfolio  investment  were  considerable  reduced,  as  related  to  the  IOF  measures;  the  stocks-
portfolio inflows fell from USD 220 billion in 2008 to USD 85 billion in 2011. Therefore, the cease and 
reversion potential became much lower. 
It’s important to highlight the intrinsic instability of this short-term flow, which may move in or 
 
out the country at any unscheduled date. Indeed, it may constitute a leading indicator to financial crises. 
In  the  2008  economic  crisis,  e.g.,  the  reversion  of  this  capital  flow  to  the  stock  market  started  before 
September, with statistics registering negative net capital flows to Brazil since June (only balanced after 
March  2009).  In  2011,  such  capital  flow  reversion  has  not  been  observed,  certainly  associated  to  the 
Ministry  of  Finance’s  attitude  to  avoid  the  creation  of  bubbles  in  the  stock  market  with  the 
implementation  of  the  2%  IOF  in  September  2009,  then  restraining  the enlargement  of  these  financial 
inflows. 

 
On the other hand, another clear effect on the inflows happened in 2011 due to the extension of 
IOF upon the short-term loan inflows. From then on, the flows with an average amortization time minor 
to  one  year  virtually  disappeared  (figure  3).  Also,  IOF  on  foreign  loans  have  been  imposed  up  to 
maturities of 5 years, then returning to the level of 1 year in Dec/2012. Actually, the decree 7698/2012 
affected  the  external  loans  granted  by  enterprises  and  financial  institutions,  with  the  monthly  average 
inflow  volume  decreasing  from  USD  9.3  billion  (in  the  12  past  months)  to  USD  6.3  billion,  which 
represented  a  31.8%  decrease  in  the  capital  inflow.  In  net  terms,  the  balance  decreased  60%,  from  a 
monthly average of USD 3.7 billion to USD 1.4 billion. Extension of the external funding maturities was 
also observed, suggesting that the IOF has the capacity to extend the deadlines of new financial inflows, 
with agents adapting operations to a more stable scenario. 
 
Even though short-term inflows may have partially migrated to longer term operations, this is an 
expected  effect,  as  authorities  allowed  companies  and  banks  to  fund  abroad  in  a  time  window  when 
international rates were substantially low, linked to monetary easing policies in central countries (figure 
3). In fact, measures where implemented in order to stabilize the inflows and avoid excessive external 
exposition to the more volatile financial flows.

4. Methodology, Data and Evidence 
 
In a given economy the measurement of the degree of capital controls and, as a consequence, the 
degree of capital mobility is not an easy task. The difficulty starts with the definition and identification of 
the  capital  controls.  The  biggest  part  of  the  researches  has  used  a  qualitative  measure,  based  on  the 
existence or not of restrictive rules on the capital mobility, as suggested by the IMF Annual Report on 
Exchange  Arrangements  and  Exchange  Restrictions  (AREAER).  This  work  proposes  a  division  of 
restrictions of transactions of the capital and financial account (where the financial flows are registered) 
in eleven sub-categories, informing the existence or not of restrictions in each sub-category. Then, the 
researches  create  indexes  for  each  publication  year  and  indicate  the  number  of  categories  with  flow 
restriction, and from that deriving and index for each year. There are many versions or methodological 
alternatives  for  the  construction  of  de  jure  indexes,  but  they  are  all  based  on  the  data  compiled  at 
AREAER (see Qureshi et al., 2011, for a recent work).  
However, such kind of indicator has been criticized for not setting a degree between the various 
 
intensities in the level of financial liberalization, or the effectiveness of the regulations of a given country. 
The variations in the time-frame would be the result of variations on the existence or not of controls over 
the flows, without the capacity of measuring the effectiveness of the flow controls. Therefore, indicators 
based  on  these  terms  are  restricted  to  the  differentiation  of  regimes  with  or  without  controls,  under  a 
dualist point of view, without reflecting the dynamism of changes implemented over time on the flow 
controls. In the same way, the indicators would not distinguish restrictions on specific capital flows of 
non-residents.  This  puts  different  economies,  that  have  different  control  regimes,  in  the  same  level  of 

capital  controls,  without  representing  the  own  particularities  of  each  economy,  in  terms  of  controls. 
Moreover, the small frequency of IMF’s data base source would also fail in collecting temporary control 
programs on capital flows, which may have a time-frame inferior to one year, ahead of not prolonged 
crisis. 
 
As  an  option  to  works  with  panel  data,  which  did  not  capture  adequately  the  extension  of  the 
control  measures,  the  individual  country  analysis is  deeper.  A  credible  methodological  possibility  was 
developed by Cardoso and Goldfajn (1998), who evaluate punctually each legislation change set forth on 
the  foreign  exchange  market,  instead  of  only  observing  if  a  given  year’s  financial  flow  category  has 
restrictions  or  not.  While  evaluating  each  regulation  that  was  set  forth,  the  authors  built  an  index  that 
captures  the  real  measures  that  were  set  forth  during  time;  this  time-frame  series  was  called  Capital 
Controls  Index  (CCI).  Basically,  they  classified  each  regulation  in  liberalizing  (has  the  intention  of 
encouraging  the  capital  movement),  restrictive  (discouraging)  or  regulate  (with  a  neutral  effect  on  the 
capital  flows),  attributing  each  case  with  the  following  codes  +1,  -1  or  0,  respectively.  There  is 
recognition that this index is more effective to capture the modification in the capital control levels. A 
series of works in Brazil followed this tradition, such as Soihet (2002), Van der Laan (2007), De Paula 
(2010), among others.  
 
As an alternative, an index based directly on the nominal aliquot of the IOF could be used. A 2% 
aliquot in a given year, afterwards increased to 6% on the following year, could seem, at first, of a higher 
effectiveness, due to the fact that it would make the economic transactions more difficult. However, the 
conjuncture may indicate that a 2% aliquot has lost its effectiveness only during time, in the sense that it 
does  not  have  the  capacity  of  impacting  the  relative  prices  between  the  domestic  economy  and  other 
financial markets – considering the differentiation of the capital interest between them. In its place, the 
increase  to  6%  may  constitute  a  new  efficiency  point,  ahead  of  a  change  of  other  relative  prices,  for 
instance.  At  the  end,  the  aliquots  can  be  equivalent  in  efficiency  terms  to  contain  a  given  foreign 
exchange flow through time, for instance. We did not choose to distinguish the measures in relations with 
the aliquots themselves, since ahead of different specific conjunctures, IOF aliquots of 2% or 6% may be 
sufficient  or  excessive  to  contain  capital  flows,  considering  the  interest  gap  and  other  economic 
conditions  that  change  along  over  time.  Therefore,  the  more  appropriate  alternative  would  be  to  grant 
same importance to regulations introducing different aliquots, independently of the subjacent aliquot to 
each regulation that was set forth.  
 
Having the above in mind and the fact that research conclusions in Brazil tend to show not so 
significant  results  linking  series  of  macroeconomic  variables  (especially  about  the  economic  activity 
levels)  to  capital  controls  in  models  of  autoregressive  vectors,  which  are  usually  inconclusive,  so  we 
choose to work with a model of structural univariate time series (Harvey, 1989; Harvey and Shephard, 
1993). We keep focusing on the primary capacity of the capital controls in explaining the changes, in a 
significant way, about the performance of external financial flows. Instead of building a own time-frame 
to  represent  the  modifications  in  capital  controls,  the  statistics  identification  of  structural  breaks  or 
outliers,  which  results  from  the  model,  will  point  out  the  extent  of  the  impacts  of  the  regulation 
modifications. More specifically, we use the state space time series analysis (Harvey and Koopman, 2005; 
Commandeur and Koopman, 2007; Durbin, 2012). A structural time series model (STM) is formulated in 
terms of unobserved components, such as a trend (level and slope), a seasonal, a cycle and an irregular 
component (disturbances). This is called ‘decomposition’, and each component can have direct economic 
interpretation through this process. The model proposed is formulated as follows: 

ty

(1) 

The unobserved components are: trend (

t ) and 
irregularities ( t). All four components are stochastic and their distributions are mutually uncorrelated. 
That is, in Structural State of Space models, it is allowed that the estimated parameters are not fixed over 
time. Thus, by observing the movements of perturbations of these parameters, it is possible to establish 
the  precise  period  of  time  when  an  exogenous  shocks  in  each  component  not  observed  in  the  studied 

t), seasonality ( t ), a cyclical component (

series2 occur. Here, we use this econometric approach to identify periods when it is possible to identify 
structural changes in the portfolio investment inflows3. The starting point was a model called local trend, 
where, on the one hand it is assumed that there are no seasonality and a cyclical component, on the other, 
there is a trend4, with: a fixed slope; and the level defined as a random walk.

In this specification it is allowed that the level of the trend changes over time, according to the 
trajectories of 
t. Therefore level breaks can be identified by this component. Exogenous shocks are not 
randomly  defined,  but  are  identified  by  the  movements  of  the  trend  level’s  residuals  estimated  by  the 
model.  Moreover,  state  space  time  series  model  allows  for  the  introduction  of  other  exogenous 
explanatory variables, which follows (4):

Where: xjt  is the value of the j-explanatory variable in time t; and βj is its estimated parameter. It is 
also important to notice that following this methodology it is not necessary to test stationary properties 
before or after the differentiation of the time series used in our models. 

We report in the sequence two different models that try to identify the effects of chance in the IOF 
in our dependent variable – portfolio investment inflows (PORT)5. As control variables we use: official 
consumer  price  inflation,  IPCA  (CPI)6;  Central  Bank  Index  of  Economic  Activity  –  Brazil  (IBC-Br)7; 
interest rates differentials between Brazil and the United States (INT/DIF)8; country risk (RIS)9; nominal 
exchange rate, Brazilian; nominal exchange rate, Brazilian Real per U.S. Dollar (EX)10; and the VIX - 
Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index11. Our analysis encompasses the period of the 
so  called  “great  recession”,  from  January  2007  to  December  2013.  We  use  logarithm  scale  for  all 
variables. Except from INT/DIF12, all economic series were seasonally adjusted.  
 
In a general way, we outlined a more restrict focus than the tradition of research in Brazil, which, 
in a general way, while considering all the regulation changes on foreign exchange flows implemented by 
the Central Bank, did not identify major effects on capital controls, especially on the domestic level of 
economic activity. The chosen option is to identify the direct effects of the main instrument for managing 
foreign capital flows, verifying whether they produce significant impacts on the financial flows. In other 

                                                            
2According to Portugal (1993), Structural State of Space models, which use the Kalman Filter, are superior in the statistical treatment when 
compared with other types of models of variable parameters. Furthermore, by allowing the estimated coefficients to change throughout the 
sample, the hypothesis of stationarity loses relevance. 
3 We have also tested for loan inflows. Nevertheless, results were not statistically significant. Due to lack of space we present here only the 
estimations for portfolio inflows. 
4 All series are already seasonally adjusted by the method of X-12 Arima. Notice that the restrict number of observations did not allow us to 
introduce a seasonal component (or to characterize business cycles).

words,  it  is  emphasized  the  issue  of  the  efficiency  of  the  control  mechanisms.  Ahead  of  the  direct 
observation  of  the  aggregated  foreign  flow,  we  seek  to  verify  the  statistic  relevance  of  the  regulation 
modifications in introducing breaks or irregularities in the external financial flows. 
 
Having  a  general  view  of  the  research  model,  the  modifications  of  each  specific  flow  can  be 
evaluated independently, so as to build a specific model for each external flow under which the IOF is 
applied.  Considering  the  research  historic  in  the  country,  such  methodological  alternative  may  be 
appropriate  to  identify  a  significant  effect  on  the  flows,  instead  of  aggregating  all  IOF  measures  in  a 
single index and all flows in another series. In this paper we report the results for the portfolio investment 
inflows. We estimate two models. The main difference between them is that model 1 includes EX as a 
control variable. Considering that there is a risk of endogeneity problem due to the potential effect of 
PORT in EX, and vice-versa, we also run model 2, where we introduce the first differentiation in EX13.  
 
Table 1 reports our results. Firstly, it is important to state that: in both models that are no residuals 
autocorrelation (Q(22,23));  and homoscedasticity of the residuals is respected (H(22))14. Annexes 1 and 2 
show  normality  and  stability  in  the  estimated  residuals.  Nevertheless,  model  1  presents  a  better 
performance. Considering the control variables it is important to emphasize that: 

(1) Exchange rate  (EX and EXt-1) was statistically significant in both models, with a negative signal, 

meaning that national currency depreciation was associated with reduction in portfolio inflows; 

(2) In model 1, INT/DIF and RIS were statistically significant, but with signals that would usually be 
considered theoretically wrongs. That is, a reduction of interest rate differentials was associated 
with  an  increase  in  portfolio  investment  inflows,  while  an  increase  in  international  financial 
markets’ volatility was associated with a surge in the portfolio inflows in Brazil. However, such 
result is consistent with the abnormal period of the so-called “great recession”. Unconventional 
monetary policies in advanced countries, particularly in the US, created the perfect environment 
for arbitrage operations such as “carry trade”, despite the overall increase in volatility capture by 
VIX.  Therefore,  “quantitative  easing”  and  zero  interest  rates  at  the  centre  channelled  funds  to 
countries with high yields such as Brazil, even with a reduction in the interest rates differentials.   
(3) In  model  2,  IBC-Br,  with  the  right  signal  (an  increase  in  domestic  activity  associated  with  an 

increase in portfolio investment inflows), EXt-1 and VIX were all statistically significant.     

(4) Model 1 shows more irregularities (outliers) than model 2, which suggest that the introduction of 
EXt-1 as  a  proxy  for  expectations  captures  at  least  part  of  the  exogenous  alterations  on  PORT. 
Most of irregularities occur in periods of stress in financial markets, due to the effects of subprime 
crisis  and  the  subsequent  “great  recession”.  Nonetheless,  we  must  emphasize  two  particular 
months: 2010 (10) and 2013 (6). 

(5) Notice  that  in  2010  (10)  IOF  increased  from  2%  to  6%,  during  the  boom  of  capital  flows  to 
emerging and developing economies, derived from the so-called “currency war”. In 2013 (06) IOF 
aliquot was once again reduced to 0%, in the context of an increase risk-aversion of international 
investors, considering what at that time was perceived as an eminent change in quantitative easing 
policy in the United States. Brazilian Monetary Authorities promptly reacted to both movements, 
using IOF as macroprudential tool.    

(6) In such a context, 2013 (6) was identified as a level break in model 1 and an irregularity in model 
2;  while  2010  (10)  was  an  outlier  in  both  models.  In  2010  a  surge  of  foreign  investors  were 
directed to portfolio, which  may explain the positive signal in the estimated parameter, as the fear 
of new taxation over stock-directed inflows may have anticipated other foreign inflows. In 2013 

                                                            
13 This  procedure  corrects  the  potential  endogeneity.  Moreover,  it  is  consistent  with  exchange  rate  determination  models  that  explicitly 
consider expectations. According to the seminal paper of Meese and Rogoff (1983), economic fundamentals – such as the money supply, 
trade  balance  and  national  income  –  are  of  little  use  in  forecasting  exchange  rates,  at  least  over  short  to  medium  time  horizons.  They 
compared  existing  models  to  an  alternative  in  which  fundamentals  are  excluded  and  any  exchange  rate  changes  are  purely  random. 
Nevertheless,  once  one  considers  exchange  rate  expectations,  it  is  important  to  note  that  “…the  empirical  evidence  concerning  which 
expectation mechanisms are best for modelling exchange rate expectations is very mixed. The most plausible story is that the appropriate 
mechanism  is  itself  time-variant,  whit  market  participants  sometimes  having  static  expectations,  sometimes  extrapolative  expectations, 
sometimes regressive expectations and so on.” (Pilbeam, 2013: 227). Therefore, EX first difference is a plausible proxy for exchange rate 
expectations. 
14 We verify the presence or not of the autocorrelation in the time series, through the Box-Ljung test, which follows a Chi2 distribution. 
Homoscedasticity test follows an F distribution. Details in Commandeur and Koopman (2007) and Durbin (2012). 

(06), the level break (model 1) and the outlier (model 2) have the correct signal, meaning that the 
reduction  of  the  IOF  was  associated  with  a  positive  change  in  the  trend  level  or,  at  least,  an 
irregularity (model 2).

In  short,  the  econometric  approach  used  here  allows  us  to  suggest  that  portfolio  investment 
inflows were affected by changes in the IOF. The 2010 (10) change introduced what can be interpreted as 
an anticipation movement by investors, who decided to bring their funds to Brazil before other elevation 
in  taxation  directed  to  stocks.  In  2013  (6),  the  aliquot  reduction  was  associated  with  a  permanent 
elevation  in  capital  inflows  (model  1)  or,  at  least,  a  temporary  increase,  where  both  results  can  be 
considered theoretically consistent. Our result, using an alternative econometric methodology, converges 
with previous researches that point out that capital controls were effective as a macroprudential tool, at 
least  in  the  short  term  (see  section  2).  This  effectiveness,  of  course,  is  still  a  matter  of  controversy, 
because it has many dimensions. It is far from clear that capital controls can, in all circumstances, isolate 
one country from external shocks, or can be efficient in the long term. Nevertheless, it is also a matter of 
theoretical  and  empirical  divergence  the  sometimes  assumed  positive  connections  between  economic 
growth or macroeconomic stability and financial integration to global capital markets. We hope to shed 
some light in this re-emerging research topic by exploring Brazil’s recent experience in taming volatile 
capital flows and its effects over the domestic economy. 
 
 
5. Final Comments 
 
The foreign financial integration has constituted a main economic policy objective of emerging 
countries, even though the way that this integration takes place does not represent a consensus among 
countries.  In  Brazil,  in  particular,  the  country  took  advantage  of  the  capital  flows,  which  granted  the 
possibility both to the access of a relatively cheaper international credit – especially if compared to the 
domestic costs – and to a resources flow that made possible the maintenance of significant commercial 
deficits during an important period of domestic price stabilization in the first phase of the Plano Real. 
However,  the  dependency  that  rose  from  foreign  capital  and  from  the  international  financial  system 
brought together the drawbacks of the capital flows instability, the ease in which crisis in other countries 
may affect the local economy and a decrease of liberty in the conduction of domestic economic policies. 
It is worth recalling that one of the country’s advantages was the low exposition of the national financial 
system to the United States’ credit derivatives, which mitigated a strong and direct contagious channel of 
the  economic  crisis  over  the  Brazilian  domestic  economy  –  it  was  the  cut  of  credit  lines,  temporarily 
substituted by Brazilian Central Bank’s resources, that affected the local economy.  
 
In this context, the use of capital controls has proved to be a useful tool ahead of the unstable 
financial flows, constituting a recommendable institutional array flexible enough to guarantee a friendly 
environment for local and foreign investments, apart from counterbalancing the fluctuations of external 
shocks. The IOF, in Brazil, has been recognized as a mechanism of effective regulation of the financial 
flows. We sought to analyse, particularly, the change in the composition of the foreign loan flows, in the 
direction of the extension of the deadlines (section 3). The econometric effort, on the other hand, resulted 
in the identification of a significant effect of IOF alteration on the portfolio investment flow, introducing 
structural breaks and irregularities in the series. Even though we brought into play a different econometric 
research methodology, the empiric efforts share the same difficulty of other researches on the subject, 
especially regarding the indication of more significant changes in the capital controls. Finally, we ponder 
about  what  are  the  costs  of  the  imposition  of  such  controls  to  the  domestic  economy,  ahead  of  the 
potential  benefits  of  the  extension  of  deadlines  which  make  the  financial  flows  more  predictable  and 
stable, keeping the economy away from potential risks of foreign instability.
