Abstract. In this paper, we analyze whether a representative investor, who holds a well-diversiﬁed
portfolio of stocks, may beneﬁt from investing in cryptocurrencies. Our analysis encompasses
several capital markets and the four most liquid cryptos. Using country-speciﬁc stock market
indices and risk free rates, our results indicate that, for most countries, cryptocurrencies ﬁt in
the tangent portfolio (maximum sharpe ratio), but not – or very little – in the minimum vari-
ance portfolio (MVP). Cryptocurrencies’ returns are riskier, but its co-movements with global
stock indices are close to zero, on average. Globally, we ﬁnd that the optimal holding of cryp-
tocurrencies is represented by Bitcoin (BTC) only and at a 4.6% share of the portfolio (when
not considering short sales). Importantly, optimization exercises using rolling windows reveal
that the optimal weight of cryptocurrencies on the tangent portfolio is extremely sensitive to the
period being analyzed, and also with the premises on expected returns.

Introduction

Cryptocurrencies represent a recurring discussion topic among academics, professionals
and general public. This growing and proliferating market – a subset of the so called market of
“digital assets” – offers appealing features, such as operating independently of central banks (de-
centralization) and using encryption techniques to verify transactions and regulate total supply.
The numbers of the market are quite impressive: as of May 31st, 2019, the market capitalization
for bitcoin (BTC) only has reached US$149.0 billions (CoinMarketCap, 2019).1 Taken together,
there are now estimated 2,213 cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of US$267.2 billions
(CoinMarketCap, 2019).

Though appealing, cryptocurrencies face huge challenges to become popular to a larger au-
dience. There are several reasons for that. One is that even industry experts ﬁnd it difﬁcult
to evaluate the intrinsic value of these assets. For example, a recent report from JP Morgan
conclude that Bitcoin “has surged beyond its “intrinsic value”” (Bloomberg, 2019). While inher-
ently difﬁcult to estimate, the authors of the report came to this conclusion by treating Bitcoin
as a commodity and calculating its “cost of production” using inputs such as estimated computa-
tional power, electricity expense and hardware energy efﬁciency. A second important reason that
repel investors from investing in those assets are fraudulent events registered in the cryptocur-
rencies’ ecosystem (in Brazil, see, e.g., a pyramid scam that defrauded $200 millions on May,
2019) (Cointelegraph, 2019b). Finally, one could point out the ongoing challenge to regulate
cryptocurrencies transactions, specially in emerging markets – in Brazil, for example, the Presi-
dent of the Chamber of Deputies has only recently ordered to establish a commission to consider
cryptocurrency regulation in the country (Cointelegraph, 2019a).

From a ﬁnance perspective, cryptocurrencies have been the subject of several recent academic
studies, exploiting and connecting subjects such as price drivers (Liu & Tsyvinski, 2018), suspi-
cious activity and price manipulation (Gandal et al. , 2018), and mean/variance analysis in the
context of portfolio analysis (Gangwal, 2016, Liu & Tsyvinski, 2018). In this paper, we seek to
contribute to the debate on the role of cryptocurrencies on diversifying portfolios of “traditional
assets”, proxied by a well diversiﬁed portfolio of stocks.2 We built on modern ﬁnance theory
to identify whether, under a set of assumptions, including cryptocurrencies on a well diversiﬁed
portfolio of country-speciﬁc stock portfolios may increase risk-adjusted expected returns. Our
focus is on different developed and developing economies, totaling 22 countries and four cryp-
tocurrencies – Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC) – in our ﬁnal
data set.

Speciﬁcally, we estimate the marginal effect of adding different cryptocurrencies to different
portfolios composed by traditional assets. The information on daily prices of crytocurrencies and
stock market indices come from Yahoo Finance, and goes up to May 31st, 2019. Our goal is to
identify how much of a portfolio should be held in cryptocurrencies (if any) in order to optimize
risk-adjusted expected returns, under different sets of assumptions. In other words, we estimate

currencies, gold, etc.

efﬁcient mean-variance portfolios of traditional and non-traditional assets, giving ﬂexibility on
the underlying assumptions of the models (e.g., expected returns, standard deviation of returns
and variance-covariance matrix).

As a proxy for well-diversiﬁed portfolios of risky assets, we consider original investments
in a global stock market index, such as: S&P 500 (U.S.), Canada S&P/TSX 60 (Canada), Dax
(Germany), FTSE100 (U.K.), CAC 40 (France), BEL 20 (Belgium), Australia ASX (Australia),
Nikkei 225 (Japan), Shanghai SE Composite Index (China), Taiwan TSEC 50 Index (Taiwan),
Hang Seng Index (Hong Kong), Mumbai Sensex (India), Jacarta Composite Index (Indonesia),
MOEX (Russia), Ibovespa (Brazil), Santiago Index IPSA (Chile), IPC (Mexico), and Merval
(Argentina).

Our results indicate that cryptocurrencies may enhance the performance of global stock port-
folios by allowing higher risk-adjusted returns. However, this seems to be more due to higher
average returns rather than risk reduction. Also, allowing for short positions result in increas-
ing BTC weight and in the addition of ETH to the long position, in contrast to the minimum
variance portfolio, which results in near zero weights under both assumptions. Moreover, we
ﬁnd evidence of time-varying optimal weights for each asset. Even though bitcoin’s presence in
optimal portfolio is more frequent than other cryptos, its weight is highly unstable over time and
full dominance over other digital assets is not veriﬁed.

Our paper connects to a wide set of recent studies in portfolio selection with cryptocurren-
cies (Baur et al. , 2018, Guesmi et al. , 2019, Kajtazi & Moro, 2019, Liu, 2019, Liu & Tsyvinski,
2018). However, most attention is given to US and China assets, and inquiries into the contri-
butions of digital assets to diversiﬁcation for emerging markets assets are still incipient. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to widely test – for both developed and develop-
ing markets – whether adding digital assets to a portfolio of traditional assets may enhance the
risk/reward relationship.

Besides trying to offer empirical evidence on the question “how much should I hold of cryp-
tocurrencies in my portfolio?”, there are other important side contributions of the paper. For
example, one is to show the correlation matrix across cryptocurrencies and among cryptocur-
rencies and traditional assets in different countries. We also check for stability in the optimal
weights in both the tangent and the global minimum variance (GMV) portfolios.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we present a brief discussion of
the related literature. In section 3, we show how cryptocurrencies ﬁt in the traditional mean-
variance framework of portfolio optimization. Section 4 describes the data we use. In section 5,
we present the results of the analyses. Finally, our concluding remarks are exposed on section 6.

2 A short review on cryptocurrencies and portfolio selection

The 2007-2008 ﬁnancial crisis uncovered the fragility of modern ﬁnancial and monetary systems
where trust in governments, banks and other ﬁnancial institutions played a central role for trans-
actions in the system. In the aftermath of the crisis, a whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto
launched the basis for a “peer-to-peer electronic cash-system” called Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008).
This system is based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, so that transactions between any

2

two individuals could dispense a third trusted party. A public ledger, known as the blockchain,
keeps record on credits and debts for each transaction and is publicly available as an open source
code, so that legitimacy of transactions can be checked by the community. Only after veriﬁ-
cation a transaction is recorded on the blockchain. This process requires computers to solve
complex mathematical puzzles, so that veriﬁcation can be done and another block added to the
blockchain, during a procedure called mining. For this service, miners receive a reward in the
form of virtual money, the bitcoin, that is added to the network’s circulation. Thus a potential
new system of payments with a genuine currency was raised, backed by data security science
and, more importantly, without a centralized control from government authorities.

Since the birth of bitcoin, many other blockchains and their respective cryptocurrencies –
also called altcoins - emerged, based on forks of the original bitcoin’s blockchain source code.3.
As of 20th July, 2019, the number of cryptocurrencies circulating was over 2500 and continues
to grow 4. But are cryptocurrencies really currencies or do they play another role? Even though
Nakamoto’s deﬁnition of a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system” implies bitcoin’s mainly use
as a currency, this is not a consensus in the literature. Economists usually state that a typical
currency must satisfy three functions: medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value.
Several authors have argued that, so far, bitcoin and it’s pairs lack at least one of them.

For instance, Baur et al. (2018) analyse the Bitcoin public ledger for 2011-2013 and ﬁnd that
most of bitcoins are held by investors, while a minority ﬁnd it’s use as currency. Besides, they
argue that were bitcoin mainly used to pay for goods and services, it would compete with ﬁat
currencies and inﬂuence their value. As such, Liu & Tsyvinski (2018) ﬁnd that major currencies,
like Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Singaporean Dollar, and UK Pound co-move, but
exposures of cryptocurrencies to these currencies are small and not statistically signiﬁcant. Also,
despite some medium of exchange characteristics, Dyhrberg (2016) classiﬁes bitcoin as being
“somewhere between a currency and a commodity”. At the same time, Yermack (2013) reminds
that retail good prices quoted in bitcoin depart from integer numbers, often leading to fractions
which require multiple decimal places with leading zeros, such as 0.01694 BTC, 0.00529 BTC,
etc, which is a non-standard practice that may confuse sellers and buyers. Together with high
observed volatility, these features pose a big barrier to using bitcoin — or other cryptos – as a
unit of account. Finally, many examples of security breaches, such as hacker attacks and theft
(BBC (2019))) or even price manipulation (Gandal et al. , 2018) cast some serious doubt on the
store of value function for cryptocurrencies.

On the other hand, empirical ﬁndings suggest that cryptocurrencies may better suit as an
asset class ((Baur et al. , 2018)). These assets present, in general, very particular characteristics,
such as high returns, high volatility, high kurtosis, presence of autocorrelation, time-varying
return predictability and low correlation with other asset’s returns (Bariviera et al. (2017), Liu
& Tsyvinski (2018), Baur et al. (2018), Urquhart & Zhang (2019)). Skewness, however, have
been found to be positve (Liu & Tsyvinski (2018)) and negative (Baur et al. (2018)).

More recently, an increasing body of the literature study their role in portfolio diversiﬁca-

tion. For instance, Liu (2019) apply different portfolio selection models, conducting a large set
of robustness checks to analyze portfolio performance considering 10 cryptocurrencies. They
point out that diversiﬁcation among cryptocurrencies can enhance performance under the Sharpe
ratio and utility criteria. However, optimal portfolios are often outperformed by the naïve equal
weights portfolio and estimation error in parameters of returns distribution may offset gains of
diversiﬁcation. Kajtazi & Moro (2019) use a mean-CVar approach to study bitcoin diversiﬁca-
tion role in different markets — USA, China and Europe -– ﬁnding converging results across
markets for performance improvement, more due to increase in returns rather than reduction of
risk. These conclusions, hold mainly for long-only and naïve portfolios, in conformity to other
ﬁndings in the literature, such as Platanakis et al. (2018) and DeMiguel et al. (2007). Under a
different approach, Guesmi et al. (2019) use a set of time series models to analyze joint dynam-
ics of bitcoin and different ﬁnancial assets and conclude that investors may beneﬁt from hedging
and diversiﬁcation gains adding bitcoin to their portfolios.

It is important to note that research in this ﬁeld is expected to increase as cryptocurrencies
present changing characteristics over time, as they move from infancy (Urquhart, 2016) to ma-
turity. Besides, authorities seek to reverse cryptocurrencies’ lack of regulation, which may lead
these assets to present new empirical features in the future. Thus, even stylized facts presented
in the literature may not be fully settled yet.

3 Diversiﬁcation with Cryptocurrencies

In this section, we brieﬂy discuss how different cryptocurrencies may help a prospective investor
to diversify her portfolio of risky and/or riskless assets. Thus, to calculate the expected return
of the portfolio, we just sum the expected return of each security considering its weights in the
portfolio (p):

(1)
Where i = 1, ..., n indexes individual securities. As ﬁrst noted by Markowitz (1952), the
standard deviation of a portfolio is not the weighted average of the standard deviations of the
securities that are in the portfolio.5 Instead, a portfolio’s SD is given by:

Rp = (R1w1 + R2w2 + ... + Rnwn)

σp =

w2

1σ2

1 + w2

2σ2

2 + 2w1ρ1,2σ1σ2

(2)

Where Equation 2 is suitable to a portfolio composed by two securities. Since Cov[R1R2] =

σ1σ2ρ12, one could substitute Cov[R1, R2] by ρ12σ1σ2, [R1, R2] on Eq. 2.

The two securities case is a good start to diagnose how diversiﬁcation affects the riskiness
of a portfolio. However, we know that adding more securities non perfectly correlated with the
securities in the portfolio may optimize the risk-adjusted returns of a portfolio. Thus, we can
generalize the riskiness of a portfolio in the context of multiple securities:

5Actually, the SD of a portfolio equals the weighted average of the standard deviations of its securities in the
particular case where ρi, j = 1, for all i, j. (i.e., where the correlation among all securities in the portfolio are equal
to +1.)

4

(cid:113)

σ2 = E[(Rp − µp)2]

= E[(w1(R1 − µ1) + w2(R2 − µ2) + ... + wn(Rn − µn))2]

Which, in turn, can be represented by:

E[wiwj(Ri − µi)(Rj − µj)] = wiwjCov[Ri, Rj]

= wiwjσiσjρij

(3)
(4)

(5)
(6)

Importantly, the portfolio’s variance is the weighted sum of all the variances and co-variances.
The matrix notation may be useful to think of the generalization of σp to a portfolio composed
by n securities:

(cid:88)

. . . w2wnσ2n
...

wnw1σn1 wnw2σn2



(7)

From Eq. 7, we can note that there are n variances and n2 − n covariances as terms of
the portfolio’s variance. Thus, as n (number of securities) increases, the covariances dominate
portfolio variances – that’s where the mathematical approach come together to the common sense
that diversifying is important to minimize risk.

Speciﬁcally, we consider the following linear optimization problem:

maximize

subject to

µp − µriskfree

σp

w1 ≥ 0, w2 ≥ 0, ..., wn ≥ 0,
w1 + w2 + ... + wn = 1.

(8)

(9)
(10)

Where Eq. 8 refers to the Sharpe Ratio, and Eq. 9 and Eq. 10 refer to the no short selling
constraint and the no leveraging constraint, respectively. Optimal portfolios without these con-
straints can also be achieved. Our baseline analyses use the no short selling condition. However,
on Section 5.3, we also allow for short sales on both stock market indices and cryptocurrencies.

4 Data and Basic Characteristics

We start our data set by downloading adjusted prices and trade volume from Yahoo Finance, from
July, 2010 (start of BTC trading) to May, 2019. The assets we collect data are both worldwide
stock market indices (see list on https://finance.yahoo.com/world-indices/)
and cryptocurrencies (see https://finance.yahoo.com/cryptocurrencies). We

5

set the frequency of data as weekly, as in Liu & Tsyvinski (2018).6 Returns are calculated using
natural logarithms. To avoid estimating the parameters using different periods (e.g., while BTC
started to trade on July 16th, 2010, time series on ETH starts only on August 6th, 2015) we only
keep observations (rows) with no missing data. Thus, all data refers to the same time span.

Speciﬁcally, our original sample covers 25 worldwide stock market indices and the 15 cryp-
tocurrencies with higher market capitalization on June 2019. Because some of the most traded
crypocurrencies started transacting only in late 2017 (like Binance Coin, Tether, Stellar, EOS,
TRON, ChainLink, Bitcoin Cash, and Cardano), we only keep cryptocurrencies with history of
data starting at least in 2015. After this procedure, our list of 15 cryptos reduces to 4: Bitcoin
(BTC), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). We do a similar procedure with
stock market data: we drop CASE30 (Egypt), TA125.TA (Israel) and JN0U_JO (South Africa)
because number of missing observations was higher than 75% of the sample ranging from Au-
gust, 2015 (month where the last crypto started to trade, ETH) to May, 2019. Thus, our ﬁnal
sample covers 22 stock market indices and 4 cryptocurrencies, summing up 139 weeks, as Ta-
ble 1 shows.

Furthermore, because our mean-variance framework includes a risk-free asset, we match our
ﬁnal data set with risk-free estimates from Fernandez et al. (2019), who surveys the Risk-Free
Rate (RF) and the Market Risk Premium (MRP) used in 2019 for 69 countries.7 Finally, we use
the Stata user-writen package “mvport” to estimate the optimal weights across assets (Dorantes,
2016).

The descriptive statistics are shown in Table 2. Consistently with most of the literature, we
ﬁnd that cryptocurrencies present much higher returns and volatility than stock market indices.
Also, most indices show negative skewness coefﬁcients, while three of the four analyzed cryp-
tocurrencies have positive skewness, with the exception of bitcoin. In terms of mean-variance
analysis, while the maximum stock index return in the sample is 0.4% a week, crypto’s returns
are at least twice as large. At the same time, while standard deviation of stock returns range
from 4.8% to 1.3%, the less volatile cryptoasset (BTC) shows 11% standard deviation. Among
cryptocurrencies, these descriptive statistics also vary. For instance, we notice that ripple (XRP)
has the highest mean return but it’s median return is negative. Also, it is twice as much riskier
than bitcoin, in terms of standard deviation. Finally, all digital assets considered present weak –
and sometimes negative – correlation with stock market indices, suggesting they may be useful
for diversiﬁcation.

5 Results

We show here the hypothetical results of a representative investor that holds the country’s stock
market index as her portfolio8 and analyzes the possibility of incorporating cryptocurrencies.

6In the unavoidable trade-off between sample size and noisy of data, we concluded that weekly is an appropriate

choice rather than daily (too noisy) or monthly (too few observations).

7The measure we use in the analysis is the median of the risk-free rate for each country.
8Even though stock market indices act just as references and are non-negotiable, one could mimic its performance

by, e.g., buying and holding an ETF (BOVA11, in the Brazilian case).

We assume the investor maximizes risk-adjusted expected returns.9 We use weekly returns from
January 2014 to May 2019 to calculate µ, σ, ρ, and Cov.

9This is the classical assumption arising from the Efﬁcient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and applied to modern

ﬁnance theory and models, such as the CAPM and the APT.

5.1 Feasible random portfolios with traditional and non-traditional assets
We begin our results by showing the feasible set of asset allocation after simulating 10,000
random portfolios. Figure 1 plots these simulations. On Subﬁgure 1a, which combines only
cryptocurrencies (BTC, XRP, ETH and LTC), we can see that it is possible to increase expected
returns (for a given level of risk) of the portfolio by diversifying across cryptos. As shown in
the Appendix, the pairwise correlation across cryptos ranges from 0.38 (ETH and XRP) to 0.71

8

(XRP and LTC), which is not as high as the correlation among some stock market indices (for
example, the correlation between DAX and CAC 40 is 0.94 in our sample). The efﬁcient frontier
– which represents all combinations of assets that offers the highest possible expected return for
a given level of risk – can be seen in the northwestern points of Subﬁgure 1a, starting on the
portfolio that minimizes risk (x axis).

(b) Cryptocurrencies + BVSP

Note: The left-side graphic includes 4 cryptocurrencies: BTC, XRP, ETH and LTC. The right-side
graphic includes the previous four assets + BVSP (Ibovespa, Brazil).

Subﬁgure 1b shows the 10,000 random portfolios composed by BTC, XRP, ETH, LTC and
one stock market index: BVSP (Brazil). As we can see, the efﬁcient frontier becomes clear as
different combinations of these ﬁve assets are simulated. BVSP is just a reference: we run this
analysis for each country in our sample, seeking to identify the combinations of cryptocurrencies
and stock market indices (portfolios) that form the efﬁcient frontier. Later, we also add country-
speciﬁc risk free-rates so we can identify one singular point in the efﬁcient frontier: the so called
“tangent” or “market portfolio”, considering investments in traditional (proxied by stocks), non-
traditional (proxied by cryptoassets) assets, and the possibility to invest in a risk-free asset.

5.2 Optimization: ﬁnding country-speciﬁc tangent and global minimum

variance portfolios

The core analysis of this paper is to estimate the efﬁcient frontier and both the tangent and
the minimum variance portfolio considering prospective investors that hold a well diversiﬁed
portfolio of stocks in a given country. Assuming a representative investor in this condition, and
expanding the universe of investable assets to cryptocurrencies (BTC, XRP, ETH, and LTC), we

risk-adjusted returns).

Table 3 shows the results of this analysis. Panel A – “Tangent Portfolio” shows the estimated
weights for the tangent portfolio. First, we can observe that, although riskier, cryptocurrencies
boosted risk-adjusted returns in all countries, both because of the higher average return and the
very low correlation with stock market indices. Digging deeper in the results, we can infer
that BTC dominates the competing cryptocurrencies regarding its share on the portfolio that
maximizes the Sharpe Ratio – it averages (p50) 32.0% (24.8%) of the optimal portfolio across
countries, with non-negative weights in all estimations. LTC also appears to beneﬁt the risk-
adjusted returns, even in the presence of BTC — it seems that combining cryptocurrencies is a
good idea instead of picking just one to invest. XRP only entered the portfolio in New Zealand,
with a close to zero weight (0.1%). The weight of ETH on the optimal portfolios is consistently
zero. As a summary, the average (p50) share of the stock market index on the tangent portfolio
is 54.1% (65.1%), ranging from 0% in UK, Mexico, Malaysia and Indonesia to 82.4% in Russia,
84.6% in the US, and 93.0% in New Zealand.

Regarding the global minimum variance portfolio (Panel B), we get a very different picture.
For US, Canada, UK, Germany, France and Belgium, the GMVP is 100% the local stock market
index. Except for Argentina (87.9%), the share of the local stock market in the GMVP is at
least 92.4%. Nevertheless, small, marginal contributions to reduce risk are found in all cryp-
tocurrencies – again, BTC leads (1.7%, on average), followed by XRP (0.2%), LTC (0.1%), and
ETH (0.0%). These results suggest that cryptocurrencies have very limited effect on reducing
standard deviation of a well-diversiﬁed portfolio of stocks, but can improve risk-adjusted re-
turns signiﬁcantly.10 Kajtazi & Moro (2019) found similar results, noting that addition of bitcoin
to diversiﬁed portfolios enhances performance more due to increasing returns than diminishing
volatility.

5.3 Is there a global portfolio of stock market indices and crytocurrencies?

Instead of estimating country-speciﬁc efﬁcient portfolios, we now put everything together and
estimate the marginal effects of cryptoassets on a well-diversiﬁed portfolio of global stocks. The
results of this exercise using all market indices in our sample and the cryptocurrencies are shown
in Figure 2. Expected returns (µ) are shown on y axis, while standard deviation (σ) is shown on
the x-axis. The blue line represents all the possible combinations between stock market indices
and cryptocurrencies that lie in the frontier. Starting on the as west as possible asset allocation
(minimum variance portfolio) in Subﬁgure 2a, all the combinations above this point form the
efﬁcient frontier.
Importantly, the results reported on Figure 2 assume that there is no short
selling (i.e., w1 + w2 + ... + wn = 100%, w1, w2, ..., w2 >= 0 and w1, w2, ..., w2 <=1).

Once we observe the tangent and the minimum variance portfolios in Figure 2, as well as
the capital market line (all possible allocation between the tangent portfolio and the risk-free
rate11), the following questions remains: which combination of assets yield the optimal and the
minimum variance portfolios? What would be the results if we allow for short selling? Table 4
helps us to answer these questions.

A short position in an uncertain asset means that one is borrowing that asset, selling it at the
present moment and incurring in the future obligation to buy it back and return it to the original
lender. This implies that, for that asset, weights in a portfolio will be negative. As shown in
Table 4, the optimal portfolio with short sales result in short positions for XRP and LTC, while
remaining in long positions for BTC and ETH. We notice that in this case, BTC weight has been
multiplied by four compared to the long-only scenario. In contrast, the GMV portfolio results in
near zero weights for all cryptocurrencies, consistent with the long-only results.

A second and interesting approach is to include the possibility of a prospective investor to
borrow and loan at the risk-free rate. In the U.S. context, it could be thought of a U.S. Treasury
Bill or Bond (nearly no credit risk). In emerging markets, one approach to estimate the risk free

10Off course, one have to consider that we are using past returns to project expected returns. Since this is a
disruptive, quickly changing technological market and the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies is very hard to measure
(if it is measurable at all), assumptions about the future based on past returns are subject to large errors.

11For the global portfolio, we assume the U.S. risk-free rate as proxy for the global risk-free rate.

rate is to consider the yield of the country’s treasury debt (say, 10 years) minus the fraction of
this rate plausible linked to the country’s credit risk, such as using the interest premium on Credit
Default Swaps (CDS) (see, e.g., Damodaran, 2008). With a riskless asset available, the investor
could not only combine investments across risky assets, but also with this riskless investment,
according to her risk aversion.

We show the results on Figure 2. The well known Capital Market Line (CML, in maroon)
represents the combinations between the riskless security and the efﬁcient or tangent portfolio
of risky assets. Any combination between the risk-free asset and the tangent portfolio is strictly
preferred to investing only in risky assets.12 The efﬁcient portfolio is the one that gives, among
all other combination between the two risky assets, the maximum Sharpe Ratio (i.e., maximum
units of return per unit of risk).

At a ﬁrst glance, it seems that combining a small fraction of cryptocurrencies to a well di-
versiﬁed portfolio of global stocks may be a good idea for an investor interested in maximizing
risk-adjusted returns. Even though assuming a different model and in other context (they look
only to the US market), our results seem consistent with those of Liu & Tsyvinski (2018), whom
ﬁnd that the optimal fraction of BTC would be 6.1%.13 In our global portfolio, the optimal hold-
ing of cryptocurrencies for an investor that seeks to maximize the Sharpe ratio is 4.6% (BTC),

12Except for the tangent portfolio itself, where the investor’s utility would be unaltered.
13Same as we do here, Liu & Tsyvinski (2018) assume in this analysis that the investor expects BTC to continue

do as well as the past years.

5.4 Robustness test: how sensitive are the optimal weights to different time

spams?

One remaining question is whether the optimal weights calculated before are sensitive (and, if
so, how much) to different time spams. To answer this question, we optimize the global portfolio
composed of world-wide stock portfolios (22 stock market indices) and cryptocurrenies (BTC,
XRP, ETH, and LTC) considering rolling windows of 52 weeks of returns.14 Our period initiates
in the 33rd week of 2015 (2015w33) and ends in the 22nd week of 2019 (2019w22). Because
we impose to have at least 52 observations to estimate the optimal weights, our ﬁrst optimization
refers to 2016w32.

To facilitate visualization, we reproduce in Figure 3 the optimal weights of stock market
indices (summed up) and the cryptocurrencies individually. While on Subﬁgure 3a we plot the
optimal weights for the tangent portfolio, on Subﬁgure 3b we present the optimal weights for the
GMVP.

Note: This ﬁgure shows the optimal weights of stock market indices and cryptocurrencies considering
rolling windows of 52 weeks of return. We consider the US risk free rate as the risk free rate for this
global, efﬁcient portfolios.

Source: Author’s elaboration.

From Subﬁgure 3a, we can see that the optimal weights of cryptocurrencies in the tangent
portfolio is indeed a lot sensitive to the sample period – it ranges from 0% to 69.7%. Furthermore,

14We do that to have one year of weekly returns for each estimation. Since our ﬁnal sample covers 139 weekly

returns, we have (139-52=) 87 sequential estimations.

BTC is the one that ﬁts best in most rolling windows (its weight averages 25.2%), while XRP
(0.3%), ETH (1.8%) and LTC (1.7%) enters the tangent portfolio sporadically.

Regarding the GMVP, as shown in Subﬁgure 3b, the sensitivity of portfolio weights to differ-
ent time spams is lower. Stock market indices dominates cryptocurrencies on the rolling GMVPs.
On average, the weight of cryptocurrencies for the GMVP reaches 0.7%, with the maximum be-
ing 3.9% and the median, 0%. The speciﬁc cryptocurrency also matters here: unlike in the
tangent portfolio, XRP and LTC are those that enters the portfolio more often, while ETH and
BTC barely appears.

6 Concluding Remarks

Using a data set of world-around stock market indices, the most liquid cryptocurrencies, and
estimated risk-free rates for 22 countries, we analyze whether adding crytocurrencies to a well
diversiﬁed portfolio of stocks may enhance risk/adjusted returns. Our results suggest that the
answer may be yes. However, the optimal holding of cryptocurrencies depends heavily on which
asset (BTC and LTC performed better than XRP and ETH) and on which stock market one
considers. While cryptocurrencies ﬁt realtively well in tangent portfolios, its marginal impacts
on global minimum variance portfolios are close to zero.

Globally speaking, even a portfolio composed by stock market indices from twenty two coun-
tries might beneﬁt from adding a small fraction of cryptcurrency. However, and very important,
we ﬁnd that the results of the optimization process is very sensitive to the period being analyzed.
Thus, real world decisions regarding holding (or not) cryptocurrencies into a diversiﬁed portfo-
lio of traditional assets should consider different scenarios for the future performance of these
cryptoassets.

Finally, the optimization process proposed in this paper is just one possibility in the study
of how traditional and non-traditional assets relate to each other. Further developments include
testing the role of other classes of assets, such as housing, corporate bonds, commodities, and
ﬁat currencies. There is also room to consider different scenarios bases on the assumptions
regarding expected returns and total risk (standard deviation) for each security. For example,
what if the market for cryptocurrency fails? What if it booms and future returns overcome
past returns? What if these assets turns out to be less volatile? This broad application may
help us to understand patterns and the how heterogeneous are the marginal effects of adding
cryptocurrencies to different portfolios around the globe. Finally, one could test the effect of the
growing market of derivatives of cryptocurrencies, such as the futures of Bitcoin traded at the
CME (Bitcoin Futures – Ticker “BTC=F” for Jul-2019).
