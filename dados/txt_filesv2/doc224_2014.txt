ABSTRACT 

This article studies the impacts of malnutrition on labor productivity, analyzing the Nutrition-
Based  Poverty  Trap  (NPT).  We  verify  the  effects  of  micronutrient  and  calorie  intake  (iron  and 
vitamins  A,  B1  and  B2)  on  the  incomes  of  household  heads  for  the  agricultural,  non-agricultural, 
independent  and other employments sectors. We applied a variation of the Durbin  and McFadden 
(1984) methods for the correction of the selection bias based on the multinomial logit data, obtained 
from the Family Budget Research/IBGE carried out from 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 in rural Brazil. 
Results  suggest  that  although  micronutrient  deficiencies  still  persist  as  a  public  health  problem  in 
Brazil, there was an improvement during the analyzed period of time.

1 INTRODUCTION 
 

A considerable amount of the recent literature on economic development has been concerned 
about wellbeing determinants included in the millennium goals. One of the key elements to comply 
with  such  goals  is  the  reduction  of  malnutrition.  With  this  perspective,  the  main  proposal  of  this 
study  is  to  investigate  the  impacts  of  malnutrition  on  labor  productivity  in  densely  populated 
countries,  where  labor  demand  is  often  lower  than  labor  offer.  As  a  consequence,  the  lack  of 
opportunities in the labor market results in low wages. In this context, the poor are doubly affected: 
they don´t receive any profits from assets, as they don´t have them, and they also have a restricted 
access to working opportunities.   

Micronutrients and wage categories may suggest that a policy aimed at increasing nutritional 
intake by the malnourished population sector may lead to a growth in salary revenues. This would 
demonstrate the importance of a policy to grant nutritional supplements to the deprived population. 
The  crucial  question  to  be  answered  is  if  an  improvement  in  nutrient  intake  could  have  any 
significant effects on rural income and therefore, on the possibility to break this trap, as well as on 
the reduction of poverty in rural Brazil. Consequently, the main focus of the public policies should 
be on raising awareness on nutritional implications. This would highlight the importance of a direct 
nutritional supplements policy, besides the inclusion of policies to directly reduce poverty.  

The  effects  of  nutritional  intake  on  labor  productivity  and  on  wage  levels  have  been  an 
important  research  area  for  health  economists  and  nutritionists.  The  hypothesis  of  efficient  wages 
shows  that  in  developing  countries  such  as  Brazil,  which  suffer  from  particularly  low  nutritional 
levels,  workers  are  physically  incapable  of  performing  hard  physical  work,  which  results  in  low 
productivity  and  low  wages,  low  purchase  power  and  consequently,  low  nutritional  levels, 
completing  a vicious cycle of misery.  This  cycle also diminishes the chances of these workers to 
escape the Nutrition-Based Poverty Trap. (NPT).  

Among  the  papers  that  empirically  test  the  existence  of  a  NPT  we  can  mention  those  of 
Strauss  (1986),  Thomas  and  Strauss  (1997),  Deolalik  (1988),  Barret  (2002)  and  Jha,  Gaiha  and 
Sharma  (2009).  There  are  also  other  studies  that  analyze  the  effects  of  micronutrient  and  calorie 
deficiency  in  workers’  productivity,  such  as  Stamoulis,  Pingaly  and  Shetty  in  2004.  As  for  the 
national  production  however,  there  is  no  economics  literature  on  the  importance  of  quantifying 
micronutrient  and  calorie  deficiency  in  the  nutrition-based  poverty  trap  development  and 
consequently on the impact of this deprivation in labor productivity. With this in mind, this article 
aims  mainly  at  analyzing  the  poverty  trap  with  regards  to  nutrition,  verifying  the  effect  of 
micronutrients intake (iron and vitamins A, B1 and B2) and calories on the income of family heads. 
Seeking to comply with these goals, we apply a variation o the Durbin –Mcfadden method (1984) to 
correct  the  selection  bias  based  on  multinomial  logit  models,  in  agreement  with  Bourguignon, 
Fournier  and  Gurgand  (2004).  The  main  goal  is  to  foresee  the  probabilities  of  an  individual  to 
participate in the labor market and use them as income determinants to verify the existence of the 
nutrition-based poverty trap (NPT). The database is created based on the Family Budget Research 
(FBD) 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 for rural Brazil. 

The  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  in  seven  sections.  Sections  2  and  3  review  specialized 
literature  on  nutrition  deprivation  and  on  the  nutrition-based  poverty  trap.  The  fourth  section 
introduces  a  methodology  that  corrects  the  selection  bias  problem  based  on  multinomial  logit 
models. The fifth section introduces the database and the econometric models to be estimated.  The 
sixth and seventh sections analyze estimated results and draw the final conclusions.  

  

 
 
 
 
 

2  THEORETICAL  AND  EMPIRICAL  ASPECTS  OF  NUTRITIONAL  DEPRIVATION 
AND THE NUTRITION-BASED POVERTY TRAP   
 

The pioneering works that relate wages, nutrition and productivity at work expressed by the 
initial hypothesis of an efficiency wage were developed by Leibenstein (1957), Mirrlees (1975) and 
Stiglitz  (1976)  among  others.  They  advocate  that  productivity  has  a  non-linear  dependency  on 
nutrition  and  that  an  increase  in  worker  calorie  intake  generates  marginal  productivity  gains  and 
consequently, higher wages. 

The hypothesis of efficiency wage models based on nutrition according to Mirrleees (1975) is 
that high wages may increase worker productivity as with higher wages, they may buy more food, 
becoming better nourished and therefore, more productive at work.    

According  to  Leibenstein  (1957),  worker  productivity  is  determined  by  the  salary,  as  it 
enables for the purchase of food, which supplies the energy that allows the worker to become more 
productive  at  work.  With  this  same  perspective,  Stiglitz’s  theoretical  essay  (1976)  describes  the 
productivity dependence of workers on the nutritional contents of their eating habits, which means 
that the consumption of more nutritive foods has a positive impact on productivity and therefore, on 
wages. On the other hand, the study developed by Ahmed et al (2007) corroborated that there was a 
significant reduction in calorie deprivation in India from 1997 to 2003.   

There  is  a  specific  international  literature  that  empirically  tests  the  existence  of  the  NPT. 
Using  data  from  rural  families  in  Sierra  Leone,  from  May  1974  to  April  1975,  Strauss  (1986) 
quantified  the  effects  of  nutritional  patterns  measured  through  the  caloric  intake  in  the  annual 
agricultural  production  and  in  the  labor  productivity.  He  found  that  calorie  intake  had  significant 
and important effects on the agricultural production. He concluded that an adequate  calorie intake 
exerted a positive correlation with family productivity. 

In a research based on the impact of four health indicators (height, body mass index, calorie 
intake  per  capita  and  protein  intake)  developed  for  Brazilian  workers’  wages  in  urban  areas, 
Thomas and Strauss (1997) using a database provided by the National Studies on Family Expenses 
(ENDEF) between August 1974 and August 1975, verified that these four indicators had a positive 
and  significant  effect  on  wages.  Such  fact  was  due  to  an  improvement  in  the  health  and  nutrition 
situation of the urban poor. 

Contrary to this however,  Deolalik (1988) applying a regression panel data of fixed effects of 
an  adequacy  of  wages  and  rural  agricultural  production  in  Southern  India  from  1976  to  1978, 
discovered that calorie intake does not affect wages or productivity, suggesting that the human body 
can adapt to short-term calorie intake deficits. However, he found out that height and weight does 
affect  wages  and  productivity  and  that  such  results  suggest  that  malnutrition  is  an  important 
determinant of productivity and wages.  

By  analyzing  rural  data  from  India  from  1966  to  1969,  Swamy  (1997)  proved  that  wages 
based on the efficiency  wage modes  based on nutrition  are rigid, as when they decrease they also 
reduce  the  workers  activity  and  increase  the  cost  per  labor  efficiency  unit.  In  a  theoretical  study, 
Barret (2002) discovered that micronutrient deficiency reduces physical and cognitive activity, thus 
affecting  work  productivity.  Such  deficiency  also  indirectly  decreases  productivity  by  increasing 
worker susceptibility to disease and infections.   
          Using  data  from  the  World  Bank  from  1994  to  1996,  Horton  and  Ross  (2003)  showed  that 
iron  deficiency in  ten developing countries such as Honduras,  Bangladesh, Nicaragua and Bolivia 
among others is related to a number of functional consequences with economic implications, such 
as  mental  deterioration  in  children  and  low  productivity  in  adult  work.  Likewise,  Lorch  (2001) 
proved that vitamin A deficiency (carotene) is a serious malnutrition that weakens the immunologic 
system and may lead to blindness.  

Micronutrient  deficiency  may  also  provoke  a  deep  impact  on  worker  productivity  and 
performance, as advocated by the study developed by Lukaski (2004). Specifically, a deficiency in 
Vitamin  B  may  cause  weakness,  reduced  stamina,  loss  of  weight  and  body  mass,  whereas  a 
deficiency in vitamin B2 may lead to alterations in the skin, the mucous membrane and the nervous 

system. Vitamin A deficiency may cause loss of appetite and increased susceptibility to infections 
while iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia, cognitive deterioration and abnormalities in the 
immunologic system. Therefore, it is important to examine the effects of micronutrient and calorie 
deficiency  in  workers’  productivity,  in  which  the  specialized  literature  has  been  focused  on. 
(LAKDAWALLA, PHILIPSON and BHATTACHARYA, 2005). 

In  an  analysis  of  micronutrient  deficiency,  Lakdawalla,  Philipson,  and  Bhattacharya  (2005) 
adopted  data  from  the  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey  III  (NHANES)  which 
contains demographic features, laboratorial analysis with blood samples and nutritional information 
collected  from  families  from  1988  to  1994  in  the  USA.  They  estimated  linear  probability  models 
and  discovered  that  nutritional  deficiencies  (vitamins  A  and  C,  folic  acid  and  anemia)  vary 
according  to  food  prices,  as  lower  costs  improve  nutrition  and  obesity  is  the  adverse  effect  of 
economic growth.   

The existent gap in specialized literature on nutrition, poverty and wages is the negligence of 
the impact of micronutrient deprivation on labor productivity, in other words, the possibility of the 
existence of  NPT related to  micronutrient deficiency.  An important  contribution in  this sense  was 
made by Weinberg  (2003) who adopted the two-stage least  square  estimation  method (2SLS) and 
analyzed the impact  of iron  deficiency in  labor productivity in  rural  India from  July 1992 to June 
1994.  However,  this  author  does  not  model  the  impact  of  micronutrient  deficiency  applying  the 
nutrition-based poverty trap.  

Seeking  to  fill  that  gap,  Jha,  Gaiha  and  Sharma  (2009)  tested  the  existence  of  the  nutrition-
based poverty trap (NPT) for four  micronutrients and calorie intake (carotene, iron, riboflavin and 
thiamine)  for  rural  India  from  January  to  June  1994  for  three  different  wage  levels  (plantation, 
harvest and others) in male and female workers. They used the Heckman sample (1976, 1979) and 
verified  the  existence  of  NPT  in  ten  cases,  which  proves  that  micronutrient  deficiency  has  a 
significant impact on agricultural worker productivity, mainly on females.  

In  the  national  literature  we  should  highlight  Castro’s  work  (1932.1946)  as  one  of  the 
pioneers in the topic of hunger, poverty, malnutrition and infant mortality, as he analyzed nutrition 
needs based on data on the metabolism of the Brazilian population.  

The referred author performed an economics study on nutrition patterns of the Recife working 
class, highlighting the living conditions of this population sector, which are narrated in his book The 
Physiological  Problem  of  Nutrition  in  Brazil  (1932).  He  concluded  that  most  workers  lived  in 
famine and died of hunger, as the wages they were paid were insufficient to select food according to 
the  calories  they  provide  and  the  amount  they  needed.  In  his  work  The  Geography  of  Famine 
(1946),  the  referred  author  introduced  the  problem  of  malnutrition  and  feeding  deficiency  by 
demonstrating  that  Brazilians  suffered  from  nutritional  deficiency  (in  proteins,  mineral  salts  and 
vitamins) diversified in the most widespread areas of the national territory.  

At  a  national  level,  there  is  no  economics  literature  on  the  importance  of  quantifying  the 
micronutrient  and  calorie  deficiency  and  the  progress  of  the  nutrition-based  poverty  trap  and 
consequently, the impact of such deprivation on labor productivity. This paper seeks to fill that gap.   

 

3 NUTRITION-BASED POVERTY TRAP  

 
The capacity curve is related to the labor capacity an individual can achieve for a given task 
and the quantity of energy necessary to perform a certain task. The stylized version of the relation 
between labor capacity and nutrition, according to Jha, Gaiha and Sharma (2009) is shown in Figure 
1. It is assumed that income is a synonym of nutrition in the sense that all income is converted into 
nutrition, which means that the money earned by the poor is entirely spent on food.

Income 

 

For  much  lower  income  levels,  all  the  energy  from  food  intake  goes  to  the  resting 
metabolism, which is  the minimum  calorie quantity that the body needs to  keep working properly 
(breathing,  body  temperature,  etc).  According  to  FAO  (Food  and  Agriculture  Organization)  data 
from  2001,  the  minimum  amount  of  energy  for  a  Brazilian  “reference  man”  with  a  weight  of  65 
kilos would be of 1,900 kcal per person a day. During this stage, little energy is allocated to work, 
so  the  capacity  curve  in  this  area  is  next  to  zero.  When  the  resting  metabolism  is  filled,  the 
additional  energy  is  sent  to  fill  the  energy  required  to  perform  physical  work.  As  from  a  certain 
income  level,  the  labor  capacity  quickly  improves  due  to  the  growth  in  the  required  energy  to 
perform work.  

When all the human body energy obtained from food intake is satisfied, the capacity to work 
increases at decreasing rates, due to the natural limit imposed by the human body. In other words, 
for very low income levels, we have the well- known decreasing scale returns factor. The non-linear 
graphic represented by a convex and a concave region represents the possibility of the existence of 
involuntary unemployment and the consequent persistence of poverty.   

The  labor  market  is  a  mechanism  of  income  and  opportunity  generation  to  acquire  good 
health  and  nutrition.  According  to  Dadgupta  and  Ray  (1986)  the  labor  market  movement  can  be 
affected  by  a  malnutrition  problem,  as  it  affects  the  capacity  of  the  human  body  to  perform  tasks 
that  generate  income.  Poverty  may  lead  to  malnutrition  and  the  latter  provokes  low  productivity.  
Consequently,  a  large  part  of  the  population  may  be  prisoner  of  a  poverty  trap  due  to  the 
malnutrition problem.  
                                                                                                  
4 SELECTION BIAS CORRECTIONS BASED ON MULTINOMIAL LOGIT MODELS  
 
Among  the  different  sample  selection  modalities,  there  is  one  that  appears  when  the  dependent 
variable  is  observed  solely  for  a  defined  population  subgroup  such  as  the  income  variable  that  is 
only  noticed  in  individuals  with  a  strictly  positive  labor  day.  In  the  simplest  cases,  in  which  the 
observation  of  the  variable  of  interest  is  determined  by  a  binary  variable,  the  problem  of 
endogenous  selection  may  be  easily  solved  through  the  procedure  proposed  by  Heckman  (1979) 
which consists of a two-stage regression on the system:   

                                      

                                        (1a) 

                                   

                                        (1b) 

In  which  (1a)  is  the  equation  that  explains  the  variable  of  interest  with  regards  to  a  vector  of 
,  called  structural  equation;  (1b)  is  the  equation  that

 through the observable behavior vector 

 and the non-observable

 In  more  complex  models  however,  the  selection  takes  place  through  a  discrete  choice 
multinomial  process.  According  to  Bourguignon,  Fournier  and  Gurgand  (2004),  the  configuration 
problem is as follows:   
                                                  

                                                 (2a)

that describes the agent choice among the M alternatives based on “utilities”

.  As  demonstrated  by  McFadden  (1973)  and 

. 

 Therefore,  based  on  the  above  equation,  consistent  estimators  for

’s  may  be  easily 

obtained through maximum likelihood. However, the problem continues to be how to estimate the 
vector for 

 parameters, considering that disturbances 

 may not be independent from all the

’s,  in  such  a  way  that  this  may  introduce  some  correlation  among  explanatory  variables  and  the 
disturbances  term  in  the  equation  of  interest  (2nd).  Consequently,  OLS  estimators  for 
  are 
inconsistent. 

Generalizing  on  the  Heckman  process  (1979),  Bourguignon,  Fournier  and  Gurgand  (2004) 
 conditional median such that

They also concluded that as relations among the M components of Γ and the corresponding M

However, as the estimation of a large number of parameters becomes necessary when we have 
a vast choice of alternatives, restrictions on

order  to  keep  the  problem  within  control  and  it  is  exactly  in  that  respect  that  bias  correction 
methods proposed in literature differ.

In the method proposed by Durbin and Mc Fadden (1984), we accept the hypothesis of

model described in (2a) and (2b) could be estimated through the OLS by the following equation:  

                     

          (4) 

 When analyzing such procedure, Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2004) noticed that the 
and the Gumbel distributions of 

hypothesis (3) imposed a specific kind of linearity between entre 

’s,  thus  restricting  the  distribution  types  permitted  for

By  applying  Monte-Carlo  experiments  to  compare  bias  correction  methods  performances 
based on multinomial logit models (MLM), the authors verified that most of the times the method 
proposed  by  Dubin  and  McFadden  (1984)  was  preferable  to    both  the  most  commonly  used  Lee 
method  (1983),  and  to  the  semi-parametric  alternative  proposed  by  Dahl  (2002).  Experiments 
showed  that  the  Durbin  -  McFadden  performance  model  (1984)  is  fairly  sensitive  to  the  imposed 
normalization  restriction  and  that  the  suggested  variation,  however  usually  less  robust  than  the 
original version, boasts higher performance when the normalization hypothesis is violated. Besides, 
it  seems  to  be  more  capable  of  capturing  intensely  non-linear  selection  terms.  Finally,  through

(1984) normalized errors whereas in (4) this normalization does not happen due to a non-linear J transformation.

5 DATABASE DESCRIPTIONS AND ANALYSIS   
 

The  database  used  was  the  Family  Budget  Research  (FBR)  2002-2003  and  2008-2009 
supplied by IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) for all rural Brazil states. From 
this  database,  variables  related  to  the  category  “family  reference  person”,  who  corresponds  to  the 
household  head,  were  obtained.  The  variable  average  rainfall  was  built  based  on  information 
provided by INMET (National Meteorology Institute).    

Initially, we use a multinomial logit model in which the dependent and explanatory variables 
are discriminated in Chart 1. This model estimates the marginal effects of response probabilities of 
working in the agricultural sector (P(ocup = 0)), of working in the non-agricultural sector (P(ocup 
= 1)), of working independently P(ocup = 2)) and of working in other employments (P(ocup = 3)). 
The  estimated  results  shall  allow  us  to  verify  in  which  form  explanatory  variables  affect  personal 
occupational decisions in the labor market.  

Additionally, these response probabilities shall be used to set factors or variables that correct 
the  selection  bias  problem  in  the  estimation  of  the  income  equation  (5)  as  demonstrated  in  the 
previous section.  In this  second stage, the estimation  of the income  equation shall allow to verify 
the hypothesis of NPT existence.

With  these  patterns,  we  estimated  four  income  regressions  using  equation  (5)  in  which 
dependent  variables  are  the  income  of  the  agricultural,  non-agricultural,  independent  and  other 
employment  sectors.  The  agricultural  sector  is  composed  of  producers  working  in  agricultural 
exploitation,  farmers,  mixed  production  entrepreneurs,  tenants,  marsh  dwellers,  rural  workers, 
foremen, farmers, temporary rural employees and trainees.   

The non-agricultural sector is composed of the extractive industry workers, civil construction 
and the textile, electronics and mechanics, iron and steel, food and drinks, tobacco, timber and real 
estate  sectors;  the  military,  the  police,  the  fire  brigade,  public  powers  and  corporate  managers, 
technicians, salesmen, services providers, professors and public services employees.  

The  independent  sector  includes  people  who  exploit  their  own  undertakings,  alone  or  with 
partners  and  without  any  employees,  regardless  of  having  or  not  a  non-remunerated  aid  from  a 
member of the family unit in their residence. It also includes the following industry sectors: trades, 
automotive,  domestic  services  and  repairs,  oil  retail  traders,  construction  and  other  services.  The 
“other  employments”  sector  refers  to  the  following  categories:  employers  (a  person  who  works 
exploiting his  own business  having  at  least  one  employee  regardless  of having or not  the  aid  of a 

non-remunerated  worker  from  the  family  unit  where  he  resides)  and  workers  producing  for  their 
own consumption.   

Besides the factors that correct the selection bias, the other explanatory variables used in the 

equation estimation (5) are described in Chart 2.   

The  choice  of  micronutrients  was  made  based  on  their  relevance  in  the  Brazilian  diet 
according  to  ANVISA  (National  Sanitary  Control  Agency).  Average  food  prices  were  selected 
based  on  their  importance  in  the  Brazilian  family  budget:  cereals  and  beans  are  the  main  items 
consumed, edible oil and sugar are intermediary goods and milk is a relatively luxury item for the 
poor.

The explanatory variables for family profiles are commonly used in literature, such as the case 
of the household head age, average years of schooling, household head gender, the number of male 
and female adults, etc. Another explanatory variable used was the average rainfall, which is directly 
related  to  rural  activities,  as  it  can  provoke  from  higher  productivity  to  partial  or  total  losses  in  a 
given  harvest,  thus  affecting  the  search  for  employment  in  the  sector.  The  control  variable 
“localization of state in coastal areas or not” reflects the effects of the level of growth or economic 
stagnation.  According  to  the  specialized  literature,  this  variable  also  affects  the  search  for 
employment (JHA, GAIHA AND SHARMA, 2009). 

It  is  important  to  highlight  that  the  Family  Budget  Research  –  FBR,  allows  to  indirectly 
evaluate  food  consumption  tendencies  though  estimates  of  expenses  made  with  the  purchase  of 
foods  for  household  consumption  and  their  market  prices.  However,  this  research  has  some 
limitations, once it does not permit to access information on individual consumption patterns.   

Therefore,  in  order  to  establish  the  participation  of  each  micronutrient  in  the  total  of  foods 
consumed  for  each  family  and  the  total  calorie  intake  per  capita,  we  use  a  Food  Nutrition  Table 
provided by the IBGE. Studies on food consumption standards in Brazil are still scarce. The FBRs 

of 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 are the only nationwide ones that include urban areas (Brazilian states 
and greater regions) and rural areas (Brazil and greater regions) available in the country.

Results  suggest  that  the  higher  the  age,  the  greater  the  probability  of  working  in  the  non-
agricultural  and  independent  sectors.  Provided  we  acknowledge  that  age  represents  years  of 
experience,  negative  and  significant  square  age  values  for  the  agricultural  and  non-agricultural 
sectors  characterize  a  concave  relation  between  experience  and  the  increase  in  the  probability  of 
working  in  these  sectors.  In  other  words,  more  experience  means  higher  chances  of  working  in 
these  sectors  until  a  certain  limit,  from  which  opportunities  tend  to  start  diminishing.  In  the 
agricultural  and  non-agricultural  sectors,  the  number  of  female  adults  in  the  family  contributes  to 
decrease the chances of being employed in 3.6% in the first sector and 4.5% in the second one. The 
number of male adults in the family does not affect employment chances in either sector.    

The family size collaborates to decrease employment chances in the non-agricultural sector in 
1.99%,  however  increasing  in  1.6%  and  0.63%  in  the  independent  and  other  employment  sectors 
respectively.  The  male  family  head  suffers  a  decrease  of  17.3%  and  13.5%  in  their  employment 
opportunities in the non-agricultural and other employments sectors respectively when compared to 
females,  however  increasing  in  19.01%  and  11.71%  their  chances  of  being  employed  in  the 
agricultural and independent sectors.    

The  average  rainfall  suggests  a  higher  probability  of  working  in  agriculture  and  a  lower 
chance  for the non-agricultural  sector. Finally, individuals  who live in  states located on the coast, 
have  a  higher  chance  of  being  employed  in  the  independent  and  other  employment  sectors  and  a 
lower chance of working in the agricultural sector.  Such variables have implications in the search 
for  employment,  as  in  general,  coastal  states  have  a  better  infrastructure  and  easier  access  to  the 
labor market.   

 

6.1.2 Nutrition-Based Poverty Trap Estimation Results (NPT). 
 

The results estimated in the model (5) to verify the hypothesis of NPT existence for the four 
sectors  are  entered  in  Tables  A1  and  A5.  A  positive  and  statistically  significant  sign  of  the 
estimated coefficient for a particular nutrient per capita variable and a negative and significant sign 
of  the  coefficient  for  that  same  square  variable  suggest  the  existence  of  NPT  for  that  specific 
nutrient. For the estimated coefficient significant effects, we consider significance levels of 5% and 

10%. In rural Brazil, according to Table A1, we observe the phenomenon of nutrition-based poverty 
trap  for  the  case  of  calories  in  the  agricultural,  independent  and  other  employment  categories. 
According to data provided in Tables A2 and A3, we perceive that the nutrition-based poverty trap 
phenomenon  is  present  for  vitamins  B1  and  B2  in  the  agricultural,  independent  and  other 
employment sectors, as the coefficients for these variables were positive and statistically significant. 
In  table  A4  we  verify  that  workers  in  the  non-agricultural,  independent  and  other  employments 
sectors are subject  to  the poverty trap with  regards to  vitamin A.  As for nutrient  iron, we can see 
that Table 5 shows that the agricultural, independent and other employments sectors are also subject 
to the poverty trap. 

With  regards  to  the  other  determinants,  the  estimated  coefficient  for  the  variable  of  average 
years of schooling was positive and significant in all regressions. This is a standard result observed 
in most empirical studies that correlate income and education. The coefficients for the price of sugar 
and  oil  obtained  a  negative  and  significant  result  for  the  regressions  of  vitamin  B2  and  iron 
(agricultural sector in Tables A3 and A5). As for the calorie regressions (agricultural sector in Table 
A1) the oil coefficient presented the same result. Nutritional deficiencies vary with food prices, as 
lower prices improve nutrition. For the other regressions, the price variable expressed a result that 
contradicted expectations.  

The  family  profile  variables,  such  as  the  number  of  male  adults,  showed  a  positive  and 
significant result for the regressions of calories, vitamin B1, B2 and A and iron for the agricultural, 
independent  and  other  employment  categories,  as  shown  in  Tables  A,  A2,  A3,  A4  and  A5 
respectively.  Results  entered  in  Tables  A1,  A5,  A2  and  A4  suggest  that  the  female  adult  variable 
boasted positive and significant results for the regressions of calories, iron and vitamins B1 and A 
for the independent sector and for vitamin B2 in the agricultural sector (Table A3). This means that 
a  higher  number  of  adults  in  the  family  working  in  these  sectors  will  result  in  higher  income  for 
household  heads.  The  family  head  age  exerted  a  negative  effect  on  income  for  the  agricultural 
sector and this square variable had a positive impact on vitamin B2 regressions (agricultural sector, 
Table A3). This seems to suggest that workers in their initial stage of their labor lives earn less than 
after they reach a certain age and achieve some work experience. 

The  estimated  coefficient  for  the  coastal  area  variable  was  positive  and  significant  in  the 
regressions  for  calories,  vitamins  B1,  B2  and  A  for  the  other  employments  category,  as 
demonstrated by results shown on Tables A1, A2, A3 and A4. However, results from tables A3 and 
A5  show  that  the  variable  localization  presented  a  negative  and  significant  coefficient  for  the 
Vitamin  B2  and  iron  regressions  in  the  agricultural  sector.  This  proves  that  agricultural  workers 
located  in  coastal  states  tend  to  earn  lower  wages  than  workers  in  the  other  employments  sector, 
possibly  due  to  the  fact  that  coastal  states  are  more  dynamic  in  economic  terms.  The  average 
rainfall  variable  did  not  show  any  statistical  significance  for  the  agricultural  sector  in  any  of  the 
analyzed regressions. In most of the studied regressions, some of the estimated coefficients for the 
variables  m0,  m1,  m2  and  m3  were  statistically  significant,  thus  showing  that  the  selections  bias 
correction was really necessary.

According to the results entered in this table, in the agricultural sector, as an individual gets 
older,  employment  chances  diminish.  In  this  sector,  age  reduces  employment  opportunities  in 
1.05%.  This  shows  that  the  older  the  age,  the  lower  the  chance  to  work  in  the  farming  sector, 
perhaps because agricultural activities demand more physical effort. This same result is not verified 
in other sectors. Still, in this area, the number of male adults in the family contributes to the chance 
of  being  employed  in  6.75%.  On  the  other  hand,  the  number  of  female  adults  in  the  family 
contributes to reducing employment opportunities in 4.92% and 7.96% for the independent sector. 
This  shows  that  female  labor  is  associated  to  activities  that  demand  less  physical  effort.  On  the 
other  hand,  in  the  non-agricultural  sector  the  possibility  for  women  to  be  employed  growths  in 
12.55%.  

 The family size variable negatively affects employment chances in the non-agricultural sector 
in  3.49%,  however  increasing  3.13%  in  the  independent  sector.  If  compared  to  the  female 
household head, the male head suffers a reduction of 11.06% in his chances to be employed in the 
non-farming sector and an increase of 6.99% in the farming sector. The average rainfall suggests a 
higher chance of working in agriculture and a lower chance of working in the non-agricultural and 
other employments categories. The coastal variable demonstrates that individuals located in coastal 
states have a lower probability of being employed in the farming sector, once coastal states in Brazil 
have a more developed economic infrastructure.   

 

6.2.2 Nutrition-based Poverty Trap (NPT) Estimation Results  
 

According to the results obtained from Tables A6 to A10, only the non-agricultural sector is 
subject  to  the  poverty  trap  with  regards  to  calories.  In  this  same  sector,  the  poverty  trap  is  also 
verified for the the iron micronutrient, according to results entered in Table A10. Analyzing results 
from  Table  A7,  we  corroborate  that  the  poverty  trap  is  present  in  the  non-agricultural  and 
independent  sectors  with  regards  to  the  vitamin  B1  nutrient  as  well.  In  the  farming  sector,  we 
noticed the poverty trap phenomenon for the vitamin B2 and iron nutrients, as shown in Table A8 
and A10 respectively. Table A9 shows that workers in other employments are subject to the poverty 
trap related to a vitamin A deficiency. As for the other determinants, again, the average schooling 
years was positively correlated to income in all regressions and the average rainfall did not present 
any statistical significance in any of the studied sectors through all analyzed regressions. The price 
of oil showed a negative and significant result for the regressions of calories, iron, and vitamins B1 
and  A  (independent  sector,  Table  A8).  The  number  of  female  adults  in  the  family  presented  a 
positive  and  significant  coefficient  for  the  vitamin  B2  regression  in  the  agricultural  sector,  as 
expressed by the results in  Table A8. Some estimated coefficients  of variables  0, m1, m2  and m3 
were statistically significant in several regressions, thus suggesting the need to correct the selection 
bias.

For rural Brazil, in the 2002-2003 period, the existence of NPT was verified for calories, iron 
and  vitamins  B1,  B2  and  A  for  workers  in  the  independent  and  other  employments  categories. 
Employees of the agricultural sector obtained the same result, except for vitamin A. Workers in the 
non-agricultural sector are subject to the poverty trap only with regards to vitamin A. In the period 
from  2008  to  2009,  NPT  was  proved  for  workers  in  the  agricultural  sector  but  only  for  iron  and 
vitamin  2.  Non-agricultural  sector  workers  suffered  the  poverty  trap  for  calories,  vitamin  B1  and 
iron. Self-employed workers suffered NPT related to vitamin B and workers in other employments 
did not suffer from NPT for calories or the other analyzed nutrients.  
 
7 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 

The  main  goal  of  this  study  was  to  verify  the  existence  of  the  nutrition-based  poverty  trap 
(NPT) analyzing the effects of micronutrient intake (calories, iron and vitamins A, B1 and B2) on 
income  in  rural  Brazil,  correcting  the  problem  of  endogeneity  between  these  variables.  Although 
micronutrient deficiencies still persist as a public health problem in Brazil, it is worth highlighting 
that there has been an NPT reduction in the studied period for most workers in the analyzed sectors, 
except  for  non-agricultural  employees.  The  improvement  in  food  consumption  patterns  in  the 
Brazilian population is probably originated in the economic and social transformations that resulted 
in  a  reduction  of  poverty  and  malnutrition.  Such  facts  suggest  that  the  increase  in  family  income 
among the poorest and the reduction of essential food prices would be effective ways to increase the 
intake  of  key  nutrients  in  the  diet  of  Brazilian  families.  These  results  agree  with  economics 
literature,  which  highlights  that  nutritional  policies  are  essential  for  the  reduction  of  extreme 
poverty  and  the  acceleration  of  economic  growth,  as  specialized  economy  and  nutrition  studies 
remark that healthy workers in better nutritional state are more productive at work. 

Besides  these  public  policies,  it  is  worth  mentioning  the  National  Policy  for  Nutrition  and 
Feeding, approved in 1999 by the Ministry of Health, which has as its main objective the promotion 
of  food  and  nutrition  safety  for  the  Brazilian  population.  The  Ministry  of  Health,  Nutrition  and 
Public Health Programs that seeks to reduce micronutrient deficiencies in the Brazilian population 
include  vitamin  A  supplements,  as  well  as  ferrous  sulphate  for  risk  groups  (babies,  children  and 
pregnant women); the fortification of foods such as wheat flower and corn with iron and folic acid 
and  the  addition  of  salt  iodide  for  human  consumption,  as  regulated  by  the  National  Agency  of 
Sanitary Control (Anvisa) through the Fome Zero Project and the program to reduce iron deficiency 
anemia in Brazil, signed together with the food industry.   

With regards to the explanatory variables that affect the occupational decision of agents in the 
labor market, we can infer that the older the age, the higher the probability of working outside the 
agricultural  sector  and  in  self-employment.  This  evidence  confirms  the  traditional  literature 
argument that older people have more difficulty getting jobs. Education measured through years of 
schooling strongly contributes to  the increase in  income in  the four sectors analyzed:  agricultural, 
non-agricultural, independent and other employments.  

In  this  context,  we  remark  the  need  for  long-term  national  public  policies  that  consider 
nutritional aspects and involve multiple initiatives such as raising more awareness among the target 

populations, the regularity of food intake research, employment and income policies focused on the 
low-end  income  sector,  reduction  of  food  prices  and  support  to  the  food  farming  industry  and 
nutritional education initiatives.  

We can therefore highlight the relevance of this study in the sense of offering a contribution 
to the economics and nutrition literature by quantifying the micronutrient and calorie deficiency in 
the  progress  of  the  nutrition-based  poverty  trap,  and  as  a  consequence,  the  impact  of  such 
deprivation in labor productivity, which emphasizes the importance of nutritional policies aimed at 
breaking this trap and reducing poverty in the rural areas of Brazil.
