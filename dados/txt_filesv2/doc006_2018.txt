ABSTRACT 

In  the  mid-twentieth  century,  Gudin  was  the  main  forerunner  of  the  professionalisation  of 
economics in Brazil. His book Princípios de Economia Monetária (Principles of Monetary 
Economics) was the first textbook in Portuguese published for a Brazilian audience interested 
in  economics.  As  the  book  was  written  during  the  period  of  the  Keynesian  revolution,  we 
show  how  he  kept  up  with  the  then-modern  debate  around  Keynes’  ideas  and  continually 
incorporated Keynesian concepts into the successive editions of his book. However, as Gudin 
was  a  staunch  defender  of  liberalism  and  the  free  market,  his  presentation  of  Keynes’  and 
Keynesian ideas was mainly critical.

RESUMO 

Em meados do século XX, Gudin foi o principal precursor da profissionalização da economia 
no  Brasil.  Seu  livro,  Princípios  de  Economia  Monetária,  foi  o  primeiro  livro-texto  em 
português publicado para a audiência brasileira interessada em economia. Dado  que o livro 
foi  escrito  durante  o  período  da  revolução  keynesiana,  mostramos  como  ele  se  manteve 
atualizado ao então moderno debate sobre as ideias de Keynes, continuamente incorporando 
conceitos keynesianos nas sucessivas edições de seu livro.  Entretanto, como Gudin era um 
ferrenho defensor do liberalismo e do livre mercado, sua apresentação das ideias keynesianas 
e de Keynes foi predominantemente crítica.

1.  Introduction 

According to Luiz Simões Lopes (1979, vi), the first president of the Getúlio Vargas Foundation 
(Fundação Getúlio Vargas, FGV), a Brazilian research and education  institution, Eugênio Gudin was so 
important to the economics profession in Brazil that “the history of methodological, didactical and political 
applications of economics in Brazil is definitely marked by two periods: before and after Gudin”. Gudin 
was  the  driving  force  behind  the  establishment  of  the  first  Brazilian  undergraduate-level  course  in 
economics at the University of Brazil.1 Additionally, he both created and edited (for several years) the first 
Brazilian  economics  journal,  Revista  Brasileira  de  Economia.  He  also  wrote  widely  read  columns  in 
important  Brazilian  newspapers  for  more  than  60  years;  conducted  research  activities  at  the  Brazilian 
Institute for Economics (Instituto Brasileiro de Economia), a branch of the FGV; and acted as a consultant, 
mainly  for  foreign corporations  operating  in Brazil. Furthermore,  he  served as the Brazilian Minister  of 
Finance for eight months between 1954 and 1955. 

Regarding his opinions on economic matters, Gudin established a sound reputation as a relentless 
promoter  of  the  free-market  and  conservative  standpoints.  In  a  famous  event  in  the  history  of  Brazilian 
economic  thought  known  as  the  “planning  controversy”  of  1944–1945,  Gudin  criticised  the  pursuit  of 
planned state-led industrialisation as the best way out of underdevelopment for Brazil. In this controversy, 
his  opponent  was  the  famous  Brazilian  industrialist  Roberto  Simonsen,  considered  to  be  the  patron  and 
forerunner  of  the  Brazilian  developmentalist  school  of  thought.2  Indeed,  despite  Brazil  adopting 
government-led industrialisation from roughly the 1930s until the 1970s, Gudin continued to defend free-
market ideas in an environment dominated by interventionist concepts and policies. 

Gudin  had  such  an  extensive  presence  in  Brazilian  economics  as  researcher,  policymaker, 
counsellor for governments and corporations, populariser of economics, columnist, and pioneer educator 
for  many  generations  of  Brazilian  economists  that  it  is  difficult  to  exaggerate  his  importance  to  the 
profession in the country. However, in this paper, we focus on a specific, yet important aspect of Gudin’s 
contribution to the profession:  his transmission  of  Keynes’ and Keynesian  ideas to  a Brazilian  audience 
during the 1940s and 1950s. As an educator, Gudin played a paramount role in  introducing theories from 
overseas to Brazil. He tried to bring the cutting-edge knowledge of economists in Europe and the United 
States to the then-small Brazilian economics community. In fact, he is recognised as the first economist to 
write about Keynes in Portuguese for a Brazilian audience (Bielschowsky 2001, 95; Carneiro Netto 2003, 
12;  Chacel  1979,  34–35;  Lewinsohn  1947,  111;  Scalercio  and  Almeida  2012,  58,  158).  In  1943,  Gudin 
published the first modern economics textbook in Brazil,  Princípios de Economia Monetária (Principles 
of Monetary Economics, PEM), through which he transmitted, among many other theories in the field of 
macroeconomics and monetary economics, Keynes’ and Keynesian ideas. 

Keynes  published  The  General  Theory  of  Employment,  Interest  and  Money  (GT)  in  1936  and, 
according  to  Leijonhufvud  (1968,  3),  “no  other  economic  work  in  this  century  has  been  the  subject  of 
anything even approaching the vast outpouring of commentary and criticism that the General Theory has 
received”. More than  just commentary  and criticism, the  ideas  in  the GT would give rise  to a  new  field 
within economics—macroeconomics—and  its mid-20th  century  mainstream paradigm.  According to De 
Vroey  and  Duarte  (2013,  14),  from  the  1940s  to  the  mid-1970s,  economists  experienced  the  so-called 
“Keynesian consensus”, with  the  transformation  of  this  new theory  into the  new mainstream economics 
being termed as the “Keynesian Revolution”.  The revolution began with  the  interpretation  of  the GT  in 
terms of what would be known as the IS-LM model; so, Young (1987, 94) referred to this process as the 
“IS-LMisation” of Keynes. 

We  assess  two  specific  issues  regarding  the  transmission  of  Keynes’and  Keynesian  ideas  in  the 
editions of the PEM published in 1943, 1947, and 1952. First, we identify the origins of the ideas resulting 
from the works of Keynes Gudin presented in his textbook. Did Gudin transmit Keynes’ original thinking 
(or his own interpretation of it) or some form of  formative Keynesianism?  In particular, considering the 
literature  on the rise of Keynesianism, we  describe the early models  in the  IS-LMisation  of Keynes that 
Gudin presented in his textbook. Second, we compare the PEM with other textbooks published in the United 

 

States around the same time, namely those of Tarshis (1947) and Samuelson (1948), to assess how up-to-
date the PEM was in incorporating then-modern developments in macroeconomics and monetary theory. 

This study of the transmission of economic thought is influenced by works such as Colander and 
Coats’  The  Spread  of  Economic  Ideas  (1989)  and  Hall’s  The  Political  Power  of  Economic  Ideas: 
Keynesianism  across  Nations  (1989).  The  former  is  important  because  it  provides  basic  guidelines  for 
general research on the international transmission of economic ideas through case studies. The latter focuses 
on the spread of Keynesian ideas and portrays in a detailed manner how the economic thought resulting 
from  Keynes’  works  became  central  to  economic  policy  formulation  in  developed  countries.  Other 
influential works that provided general guidelines for our study are Cardoso (2009), Mäki (1996), and the 
pioneering works by Dorfman (1955), Hutchison (1955), and Spengler (1970). 

 

2.  Eugênio Gudin on the Brazilian economy and the literature on Eugênio Gudin 

Before analysing Gudin’s transmission of Keynes’ and Keynesian ideas in Brazil, we present two 
elements concerning the  intellectual  context to which  our work refers.  We  first briefly  identify Gudin’s 
main  ideas  and  interpretations  about  the  the  Brazilian  economy.  Second,  we  succinctly  review  how  the 
literature on Gudin interprets and labels his work. 

2.1. Gudin on the Brazilian economy 

We can summarise the basic aspects of Gudin’s  interpretation  of  the Brazilian economy through 
four ideas. First, Gudin characterised the Brazilian economy as a  “reflex economy”. According to Gudin 
(1947, 276; 1954a, 285), The economic cycles experienced by reflex economies are mainly a reverberation 
of the economic cycles experienced by leader economies. Indeed, since Brazilian economic performance 
was chiefly conditioned by the performance of leader economies, there was little room for manoeuvre on 
the part of the country’s policymakers (Lecture by Dr Eugênio Gudin for the Cordoba and Harvard Students, 
17 July 1940, Gudin Papers, EUG pi GUDIN, E. 1940.07.17). Because active economic policy would not 
be effective in a reflex economy, Gudin used this idea to argue against the rise of economic interventionism 
that predominated in the mid-20th century in Brazil. 

Second,  according  to  Gudin,  the  Brazilian  economy  was  also  characterised  by  persistent 
“hyperemployment”  (hiperemprego).  He  coined  this  term  to  refer  to  the  situation  in  which  the  average 
employment level in the economy gravitates around 100%. Under Gudin’s definition of employment, the 
employment rate can go above 100% when people who would not work under normal circumstances (e.g. 
homemakers  and  retirees)  become  willing  to  do  so  “under  the  pull  of  strong  demand”  (On  inflation, 
September 10, 1958, Gudin Papers, EUG pi THE MONT PELERIN SOCIETY 1958.09.13). The concept 
of  hyperemployment  was  an  argument  he  used  in  opposition  to  the  idea  of  his  adversaries—the 
developmentalists—that  the  Brazilian  economy  could  be  characterised  as  regularly  suffering  from 
insufficient demand (Gudin 1952a, 229). In Gudin’s opinion, since the economy was in a persistent state 
of  hyperemployment,  fiscal  expenditure  and  governmental  financial  support  for  industrialisation  would 
only result in increasing inflation. 

Third, Gudin constantly argued the Brazilian economy suffered from widespread low productivity. 
Therefore,  the  solution  to  Brazilian  underdevelopment  did  not  necessarily  require  the  state-led 
industrialisation  advocated by developmentalists, but rather the reinforcement  of market  forces, through 
which productivity in the agricultural sector could rise. This would be easier to achieve since the highest 
productivity  in  the  Brazilian  economy  was  already  in  this  sector.  However,  Gudin  was  not  against 
industrialisation  per  se.  He  condemned  state-led  “artificial”  industrialisation  that  could  result  in  the 
establishment  of protected  industries with  low productivity  and, consequently,  low competitiveness.  For 
Gudin, Brazilian industry should emerge through the natural operation of market forces (Agriculture: South 

 

America,  September  12,  1958,  Gudin  Papers,  EUG  pi  THE  MONT  PELERIN  SOCIETY  1958.09.13; 
Gudin 1954b, 2010). 

Finally, concerning his methodological views, he disagreed with the developmentalist notion that a 
new economic theory was required to study underdeveloped countries. In Gudin’s opinion, contrary to the 
developmentalist  argument  that  developed  and  underdeveloped  nations  had  distinct  structures,  the 
operation  of  different  economies  was  similar.  Consequently,  Latin  American  economists  should  ground 
their analyses on the principle of “same equations, different parameters”. That is, the same theory would 
fit  developed  and  underdeveloped  economies  as  long  as  its  “parameters”  were  adapted  to  each  specific 
context (Gudin 1952b, 53). This conception of the universal validity of economic theory was the basis of 
Gudin’s obstinate quest for cutting-edge economic knowledge from the United States and Europe. 

 

2.2. The literature on Eugênio Gudin 

We divide the  literature  dealing with Gudin’s  life and work  into four categories:  the  free-market 
conservative,  Marxist,  developmentalist,  and  historiographic  approaches.  The  works  of  the  free-market 
conservative approach show a clear apologetic tone, praising Gudin’s accomplishments as a great defender 
and  pioneer  of  free-market  ideas  in  Brazil.  The  most  important  writings  in  this  category  are  Gudin’s 
biography by Márcio Scalercio and Rodrigo de Almeida (2012) and the book Eugênio Gudin Visto por Seus 
Contemporâneos  (Eugênio  Gudin  as  Seen  by  His  Contemporaries),  to  which  important  Brazilian 
economists  such  as  Mário  Henrique  Simonsen,  Roberto  Campos,  and  Octávio  Gouvêa  de  Bulhões 
contributed (FGV 1979). While there is important biographical information in these books, the apologetic 
tone is predominant. 

Authors who adopted the Marxist approach include Borges (1996, 2000) and Abrahão (1999), who 
argued that Gudin’s works were scientifically ill-founded and not innovative since, in their opinions, they 
were mere repetitions of the free-market ideologies elaborated abroad (Borges 1996, 45–46; 2000, 110). 

The  developmentalist  approach  was  remarkably  more  modern  and  less  affected  by  ideological 
preferences.  As  such,  the  treatment  given  to  Gudin’s  writings  was  more  historiographic  and  technical. 
However, these authors assumed a position against most of Gudin’s ideas. The main works in this category 
are those by Bielschowsky (1995, 2001). Bielschowsky (1995) may be the most important book about the 
mid-20th  century  Brazilian  history  of  economics.  The  author  presented  a  rather  technical  and  rich 
comparison  of  the  Marxist-socialist,  developmentalist,  and  liberal  approaches  advocated  by  Brazilian 
economists between 1930 and 1964. 

Regarding the historiographic line of works, articles dealing with specific aspects of the Brazilian 
history  of  economics  include  those  by  Boianovsky  (2010,  2012),  Haddad  (1981),  Chieza  and  Gaspary 
(2014), and Loureiro (1996). Gudin’s career and works were analysed in these papers as part of the specific 
issues  of  20th  century  Brazilian  and  Latin  American  economics.  None  of  these  historiographical  works 
exclusively focused on Gudin. 

In most studies of Gudin, however, a common question appears: how to label Gudin’s approach to 
economics? The usual  view  is that Gudin was a  monetarist  economist.  Subscribers to this argument are 
Bielschowsky (1995, 67; 2001, 96), Boianovsky (2012, 283, 286, 316), Borges (2004, 136), Campos (1996, 
38), Loureiro (1996, 192–193), Mantega (1984, 12), and Scalercio and Almeida (2012, 207–208). In this 
strand of literature, he was sometimes classified as “conventional”, and at other times, as an “unorthodox” 
monetarist. Additionally, Abrahão (1999, 21) and Campos (1979, 142; 1996, 242) depicted Gudin as deeply 
influenced by Austrian economics. 

Furtado, perhaps the most famous Brazilian economist of the 20th century, classified Gudin rather 
differently: “Thanks to his practical sense, [Gudin] did not lose himself in disquisitions à la Viner. He could 
easily  slide  into  heterodoxy  in  his  arguments,  without  ever  abandoning  his  always  conservative 
conclusions”  (1985,  142).  We  agree  Gudin  was  mainly  a  practical  man,  essentially  concerned  with 
overcoming the underdeveloped condition of Brazil at the time. Despite praising classical and neoclassical 

 

economics, he did not confine himself to a specific theoretical paradigm—just as Furtado argues. Indeed, 
Gudin used many economic perspectives and theories to advocate his free-market and conservative ideas. 

 

3.  The PEM and Gudin’s presentation of Keynes’ and Keynesian ideas 

The  period  over  which  Gudin  wrote  the  PEM  witnessed  the  early  development  of  what  would 
become mid-20th century mainstream macroeconomics. Gudin published the first three editions of the PEM 
in  1943,  1947,  and  1952,  namely  before  the  Walrasian  interpretation  of  Keynes  in  Patinkin’s  Money, 
Interest, and  Prices (1956).  Indeed, the  PEM was essentially  planned as  a textbook  for the Portuguese-
speaking Brazilian audience to learn  the economic theory developed in major universities in Europe and 
the United States. As most Brazilians interested in economics in the mid-1940s could not read English or 
other  foreign  languages,  a  Portuguese-written  textbook  was  crucial  to  building  a  broader  community 
interested and trained in economics (Bielschowsky 2001, 92; Scalercio and Almeida 2012, 142; Simonsen 
1979, 93). 

Given this context and that the PEM focused on macroeconomics and monetary economics, Keynes’ 
and Keynesian concepts would necessarily constitute one of Gudin’s leading sources. Bielschowsky (2001, 
95), Chacel (1979, 34-35), Scalercio and Almeida (2012, 158–159), and Simonsen (1979, 108) all argued 
that  Gudin  was  the  first  writer  to  transmit  Keynes’  and  Keynesian  ideas  to  Brazilians  interested  in 
economics. However, this literature does not provide evidence or detailed discussions on this argument. In 
what  follows, we  thus examine  how Keynes’  ideas  and the then-ongoing construction  of the Keynesian 
consensus were incorporated in these three editions of the PEM. 

Chacel  (1979,  34–35)  claimed  the  second  edition  of  the  PEM,  published  in  1947,  marked  an 
inflexion in Gudin’s transmission of Keynes’ and Keynesian ideas. On the contrary, Bielschowsky (2001, 
95) and Scalercio and Almeida (2012, 158) stated that only in the third edition published in 1952—when 
the  book  had  gained  a  second  volume—did  Gudin  present  Keynes’  and  Keynesian  ideas  in  a  more 
sophisticated and up-to-date  fashion. Again, none of these authors provided evidence  in support of their 
arguments.  Therefore,  the  next  section  of  the  paper  describes  how  Keynes’  and  Keynesian  ideas  were 
successively integrated into the first three editions of the PEM.3 

3.1. The first edition: The neglect of the GT 

The first edition of the PEM was published in a single volume in 1943.4 Gudin’s biographers affirm 
that the book was a work Gudin started because of the 1937 coup d’état by the Brazilian dictator Getúlio 
Vargas.5 Ideologically, the Vargas dictatorship in that period was characterised by fascist inclinations and 
economic  interventionism, pushing  free-market  ideas towards  marginalisation. Consequently,  in the  late 
1930s,  Gudin  had  to  tone  down  his  public  support  of  radical  free-trade  and  free-market  agendas.  The 
intellectual endeavour of writing a textbook was thus a way of dealing with this political marginalisation 
(Scalercio and Almeida 2012, 82). 

Regarding the foreign theories transmitted in the 1943 edition, Gudin’s references included classical 
ideas from the founding fathers of economics such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo as well as theories 
of important economists from the 1930s such as Arthur Pigou, Ralph Hawtrey, Bertil Ohlin, and, above all, 
Keynes. Indeed, Keynes alone is mentioned 55 times in the book (Gudin 1943, passim). However, Gudin 
paid no specific attention to Keynes’ GT in the first edition of the PEM. This is perhaps to be expected as 
the first textbooks to present Keynesian ideas were The Elements of Economics by Lorie Tarshis, published 
in 1947, and Economics by Paul Samuelson, published  in 1948. Therefore,  when the 1943 edition came 
out, the Keynesian revolution had not yet reached a stage where it was being presented in textbooks (Pearce 
and Hoover 1995, 186).  

In  the  1943  edition,  Gudin  explicitly  referenced  Keynes’  A  Tract  on  Monetary  Reform  (1923), 
quoted four times, and A Treatise on Money (1930), quoted seven times. For instance, Gudin (1943, 187, 

 

204, 210, 231) cited Keynes to discuss the strengths and flaws of the traditional quantity theory of money. 
Other minor quotes from A Treatise on Money relate to banking. For example, Gudin (1943, 117) presented 
Keynes’ bank theory regarding deposits and discussed  his  ideas about  the Bank  of England and  interest 
rates in London and New York (Gudin 1943, 394, 422). 

 

3.2. The second edition: The first mention of the GT 

By  the  time  the  second  edition  was  published  in  1947,  Gudin  was  already  working  on  a  second 
volume  of  his  textbook.  Nonetheless,  he  decided  to  publish  this  new  edition  of  the  first  volume  before 
concluding the second planned volume. In the 1947 preface, Gudin (1947, 11) stated “the modifications 
introduced in this edition are especially due to the necessity, which I verified by the time I started writing 
the second volume, to establish a tighter link between production, currency, and credit phenomena”. As is 
well known, the links between monetary phenomena, credit, and production (i.e. income, employment) are 
the focus of the GT. Therefore, Gudin here made reference precisely to the main theme of Keynes’ most 
famous work.  Indeed,  in this  new edition,  the  GT  is the most cited  of Keynes’ works with  nine  explicit 
references (Gudin 1947, 68, 150–151, 154, 161, 166, 177) and many more points where it is assumed to be 
the  source  for  the  presented  arguments.  However,  we  believe  this  presentation  of  Keynesian  theory  is 
somewhat scattered and disorganised. In particular, it is a different presentation than that the third edition, 
which we discuss in the next subsection. 

To understand how up-to-date Gudin’s presentation of Keynes’ or Keynesian ideas in the PEM was, 
it is interesting, for instance, to consider what he wrote on liquidity preference theory (Gudin 1947, 68–69). 
In discussing this theory, Gudin’s comments pointed to the interpretation that would become the standard 
in the macroeconomics mainstream (Gudin 1947, 155–156). Although he recognised Keynes had advanced 
a new interest theory, he noted it could be easily attached to what Keynes called classical theory (Gudin 
1947,  69).  In  Gudin’s  opinion,  liquidity  preference  theory  improved  the  prior  explanation  of  the 
“subjective”  motives  behind  money  supply.  Keynes’  concept  divided  “the  process  from  which  money 
supply derives in two [causal elements]”. The first of these elements depends on the accumulation of capital, 
whereas  the  second  depends  on  capitalists’  decisions  to  put  capital  in  its  money  form  onto  the  funding 
market, thereby exchanging  liquidity  for a gain  from interest.  In discussing Keynes’  innovations, Gudin 
(1947, 155–156) concluded Keynes had not replaced classical Marshallian theory, but rather reformed and 
developed it. Thus, the new theory proposed by Keynes is completely compatible with the prior classical 
theory. 

3.3. The third edition: Presenting, discussing, and criticising Keynes and Keynesian 

economics for a Brazilian audience 

In the third edition of  the PEM, Gudin incorporated a more modern and up-to-date monetary and 
macroeconomic debate,6 roughly at par with  other textbooks published  in the United States  at that time, 
particularly  Tarshis’ (1947) and Samuelson’s (1948). In  the  new  volume, Gudin showed awareness that 
Keynesian  economics  did  not  coincide  with  Keynes’  own  ideas.  For  instance,  when  commenting  on 
increasing  nominal  wages  as  an  anticyclical  instrument,  Gudin  noted  the  difference  between  Keynesian 
propositions  and Keynes’  own position (Gudin 1952a, 210). Additionally,  in a discussion  on Keynesian 
monetary  theory,  Gudin  (1954a,  282)  warned  the  reader  his  presentation  was  “[…]  according  to  a 
Keynesian theory (although not according to Keynes himself) […]”. Therefore, for the first time in these 
three editions of the PEM, Gudin explicitly noted some Keynesian arguments could not be traced back to 
Keynes himself. In addition, in a letter to Raúl Prebisch after the Argentinian economist sent him his book 
on Keynesian ideas, Gudin wrote about his plans for the new edition, mentioning the Keynesian approach: 
“I received with great pleasure […] a typewritten copy of your new compendium about Keynesian theory, 
which I will eagerly read, […] because it is directly linked to the core of the 2 nd volume of my Principles 

 

 

of Monetary Economics” (Gudin to Prebisch, 2 July 1947, Prebisch Papers, Reel 3, Folder 57). 

In this third edition, of the 192 times Keynes is mentioned, 135 (70%) are in the second volume. As 
for the GT, the number is even more significant: 39 of the 48 (81%) references to the GT are found in the 
second volume. However, more importantly, the third edition of the PEM also mentioned the authors that 
created  the  then-forming  Keynesian  economics.  Alvin  Hansen,  for  example,  the  leading  American 
Keynesian according to Tily (2007, 105) and a  key  economist  in the process of  Keynes’  IS-LMisation,7 
was quoted 22 times by Gudin; these quotes referred to five different works by Hansen. Further, two of the 
three authors De Vroey (2015, xv) considered to be the protagonists in the rise of Keynesianism, John Hicks 
and  Franco  Modigliani,8  were  cited  eight  times  in  the  second  volume.  Several  papers  by  other  authors 
involved in building mid-20th century mainstream macroeconomics were also cited in the 1952 edition of 
the PEM. For instance, Gudin cited articles authored by Paul Samuelson, Dennis Robertson, 9 Jacob Viner, 
Gottfried Haberler, and Bertil Ohlin. 

Nonetheless, although Gudin showed respect for Keynes as an important economist, he recurrently 
remarked his theories were relatively non-innovative in comparison with those Keynes named as classical. 
Gudin’s  tone  in  relation  to  Keynes’  and  Keynesian  ideas  is  undoubtedly  critical.  Further,  when  Gudin 
agreed with the authors he was presenting, he concurred with Keynesian interpreters, rather than Keynes’ 
original  works.  In  the  following,  we  present  four  topics  we  considered  important  to  show  how  Gudin 
presented Keynes’ and Keynesian ideas in the third edition of the PEM. 

First,  he  (1952a,  209)  affirmed  that  the  most  important  feature  of  the  GT  was  its  theory  of 
unemployment,  which  intended  to  correct  what  Keynes  called  classical  theory  by  allowing  for  the 
possibility of an unemployment equilibrium. Tarshis (1947, 346) and Samuelson (1948, 273) also presented 
the Keynesian theory of unemployment in their textbooks. Thus, the Brazilian textbook included in 1952 
information presented to an English-speaking audience only a few years before. 

In  particular,  Gudin  presented  the  idea  of  an  unemployment  equilibrium  based  on  the  papers  by 
Haberler (1946), Hansen (1938, 1946), and Viner (1936). He explicitly subscribed to Hicks’ opinion, who 
interpreted Keynes’ views to be a special case of the classical model, referring to this particular solution as 
the case of the liquidity trap.10 Gudin (1952a, 71) also referred to this case in the way Hawtrey had called 
it in his Capital and Employment, published in 1937: the “dead point”. Later in the PEM, Gudin (1952a, 
217) affirmed that the unemployment equilibrium is a fortuity that would be seldom verified in practice. 
He attributed this statement to “Haberler and ‘others’” and commented  on the consequences  of Keynes’ 
theory due to the possibility of the “Pigou effect”. 

Since Keynes (1973 [1936], 207), after reading his early interpreters’ works, disagreed and rebutted 
the liquidity trap as the main cause of the unemployment equilibrium, Gudin was obviously presenting the 
Keynesian  version  of  the  theory  of  unemployment  instead  of  Keynes’  original  formulation  of  it. 
Additionally, as the liquidity trap interpretation of Keynes’ theory of unemployment was published before 
Modigliani’s 1944 model, in which the causes of the unemployment equilibrium go beyond the special case 
of the  liquidity trap, we can affirm Gudin  presented the earliest Keynesian interpretation  of Keynes, the 
first step towards the IS-LMsation of the GT (De Vroey 2000; Rubin 2004).11 

Second,  Gudin  discussed  a  Keynesian  theory  of  the  business  cycle  and  the  concept  of  secular 
stagnation. According to Gudin, neither did Keynes work on a new theory nor did he fit his business cycle 
theory to any existing one (Gudin 1952a, 224). Therefore, the theory Gudin (1952a, 206) presented was not 
Keynes’ original but Hansen’s version of it, called the secular stagnation thesis. As indicated by Backhouse 
and Boianovsky (2016, 2), secular stagnation theory had been important in the 1940s and 1950s. Although 
Hansen did not regard secular stagnation as an idea originating from Keynes, Hansen’s interpreters such as 
Samuelson attributed its origins to Keynes (Backhouse and Boianovsky 2016, 9). The secular stagnation 
thesis was also presented in Samuelson’s (1948, 418–421) Economics. Gudin (1952a, 161) also considered 
the secular stagnation thesis as originating from Keynes’ writings. 

Secular  stagnation  was  defined  by  Hansen  (1939,  4)  as  “[...]  sick  recoveries  which  die  in  their 
infancy  and  depressions  which  feed  on  themselves  and  leave  a  hard  and  seemingly  immovable  core  of 

 

 

unemployment”. The causes of unemployment in his thesis are declines in the rates of population growth 
and  technological  progress.  Its  main  underlying  argument  is  that  economic  maturity—represented  by 
slower  population  growth  and  technological  progress—make  it  more  difficult  to  accumulate  capital  at 
significantly  high  rates.  Consequently,  there  are  insufficient  investment  opportunities  to  sustain  full 
employment, generating the aforementioned underemployment equilibrium (Backhouse  and Boianovsky 
2016, 946–947, 954; Hansen 1939, 3–4). 

Arguing that the secular stagnation thesis had its origins in Keynes’ works, Gudin presented it in a 
critical manner. He disagreed with Hansen’s basic idea, subscribing to the critical arguments presented by 
Haberler (1936) and Viner (1936). For Gudin (1952a, 162–163), the secular stagnation thesis extrapolated 
the  cyclical  movements  from  the  1930s  and  1940s  into  secular  tendencies.  Specifically,  Gudin  argued 
Keynes’  fundamental  psychological  law  of  the  marginal  propensity  to  consume  could  be  applied  to  the 
short,  but  not  the  long  run  (Gudin  1952a,  163).  As  such,  there  would  be,  ceteris  paribus,  no  secular 
stagnation because there is no long-run stability in the marginal propensity to consume. 

Third,  in  the  same  critical  vein  and  although  the  third  edition  of  the  PEM  presented  Keynesian 
arguments in a much more organised manner than the second edition, Gudin commented on other important 
elements  of  Keynes’  and  Keynesian  theories  in  a  scattered  manner  throughout.  These  themes,  such  as 
liquidity  preference  theory,  were  also  presented,  although  in  a  more  systematic  and  organised  way,  by 
Tarshis (1947, 324–328) and Samuelson (1948, 304, 308). 

For example, Gudin (1952a, 67–72) questioned the validity of both Keynes’ and Hansen’s interest 
rate  theories.  Grounded  on  Robertson’s  (1936,  175–176;  Ohlin,  Robertson,  and  Hawtrey  1937,  431) 
criticism, Gudin argued that Keynes’ interest theory was inaccurate because he used liquidity preference as 
the  crucial  element  for  explaining  the  motivation  to  invest.  According  to  Gudin,  to  take  the  liquidity 
preference as the most important motivation to invest would be “to forget the essential to mention only the 
incidental”. Based on Robertson, he defended the abstinence of consumption as the essential feature for the 
motivation to invest. Therefore, the “marginal abdication of consumption” would be the crucial element in 
the  determination  of  the  interest  rate  (Gudin  1952a,  68-69).  Furthermore,  the  interest  rate  ought  to  be 
considered as a function of total supply and demand for a type of money that needed to be specified and 
not, as Gudin argued Keynes stated, for responding to the liquidity preference and a quantity of an undefined 
type—and consequently an undefined quantity—of money (Gudin 1952a, 69). The latter argument Gudin 
attributed to Viner (1936), Robertson (1936), and Hawtrey (1937). 

As another example, Gudin also commented on the marginal efficiency of capital and its relation to 
the interest rate. He criticized Keynes again. However, in our opinion, he presented a concept of the interest 
rate  that  did  not  conflict  with  Keynes’  ideas.  Surprisingly,  Gudin  (1952a,  56)  cited  Schumpeter  (1983 
[1934],  158)  and  argued  the  interest  rate  is  a  “natural  offshoot  of  profits”.  An  entrepreneur  would  only 
accept the onus of borrowing money if he/she expected his/her bonus to be higher than the profit rate he/she 
would earn from  investing. Schumpeter (1983 [1934], 210) defined the  interest rate  as a sort  of  “tax  on 
entrepreneurial profit”. On this  issue, we  believe the labelling  of concepts differs;  however, Gudin used 
Schumpeter to present an idea that did not disagree with Keynes’ arguments. 

Fourth,  as a staunch defender  of  liberal  ideas such  as the  free  market and  free trade, Gudin  also 
challenged Keynes’ social philosophy—from the last chapter of the GT—and presented several conclusions 
about this matter that transcend a strict theoretical scope. In an unusual manner for a textbook, Gudin called 
Keynes the “false friend of capitalism”, condemning him for defending investment socialisations and the 
euthanasia of the “capitalist” (Gudin 1952a, 226). According to Gudin, the ideas presented by Keynes in 
his social philosophy chapter seem inconsistent with Keynes’ diagnoses and policy prescriptions because 
his recommendations of fiscal and monetary policies were meant to sustain the capitalist system, not ruin 
it.  Quoting  the  “unsuspected”  Alvin  Hansen  and  insinuating  Keynes  tended  towards  socialism,  Gudin 
argued  socialisation  would  lead  the  economy  towards  a  planned  economy  that  would  ruin  “our  actual 
economic system” (Gudin 1952a, 226). Indeed, the notion that any type of governmental planning of the 
economy would lead to socialism was frequent in Gudin’s works (Gudin 1952a, 226; 2010, 78). 

 

 
Finally,  in  another  non-theoretical  critique,  Gudin  complained  about  what  he  called  the 
“labyrinthine language” used by Keynes in the GT. In Gudin’s opinion (1952a, 224): “It is curious that a 
man  with  Keynes’  classical  and  humanistic  culture  would  build  unnecessarily  complicated  schemes 
expressed in far-fetched terminology”. Moreover, by using a rhetorical recognition of Keynes’ importance, 
he  wrote:  “[…]  the  debate  sterility  created  by  this  confusion  [the  complicated  character  of  Keynes’ 
presentation in the GT] and the most unfair despise devoted to so many eminent economists [the so-called 
classicists who came before Keynes with similar theories], represent, still, a low price to be paid for the 
extremely valuable contribution brought by Keynes […]” (Gudin 1952a, 227). 

However, although Gudin’s textbook ignored Modigliani’s 1944 paper in his textbook,12 and even 
considering Gudin was geographically far from the mainstream centres where Keynesian ideas were being 
launched, he was aware about what was being discussed in American and European academia. For instance, 
in 1957, in personal correspondence with Jacob Viner, he debated Patinkin’s new book Money, Interest, 
and Prices.13 Following the same position in the PEM, he was critical of the book, not because Patinkin’s 
position was Keynesian, but because it was Walrasian. He told Viner he believed the general equilibrium 
to be an “often sterile tool” (Gudin to Viner, 15 July 1957, Viner Papers, Box 12, Folder 15). Furthermore, 
in the same letter to Viner—as well as in his review of Patinkin’s book—Gudin was straightforward in his 
position:  “[…]  If  a  deluge  were  to  wash  away  all  the  great  treatises  on  economics,  I  would  rather  lose 
Walras’ Éléments than Marshall’s ‘Principles’” (Dr Gudin’s Review of Patinkin, Baumol to Viner, June 
21, 1957, Viner Papers, Box 12, Folder 15). Additionally, Gudin wrote to Viner: “Patinkin’s main object, 
like  Keynes,  is  to  build  a  system  and—more  than  Keynes—a  general  equilibrium  system,  in  which  no 
possible  variable should be missing” (Gudin to Viner, July 15, 1957, Viner Papers, Box 12, Folder 15). 
Finally,  he  thought  Keynes’  theory  was  more  realistic  than  the  Walrasian  version  of  Keynesianism 
developed by Patinkin: “It is […] right to point out that Patinkin’s book is  on a more abstract level than 
Keynes’ who, undoubtedly, attempted to come more closely to grips with reality” (Dr Gudin’s Review of 
Patinkin, Baumol to Viner, June 21, 1957, Viner Papers, Box 12, Folder 15). 

4.  Concluding remarks 

In this paper, we show how a pioneering South American economist, isolated from the main centres 
of  economics  academia,  was  able  to  update  the  textbook  he  wrote  for  a  Portuguese-speaking  Brazilian 
audience  by  incorporating  offshoots  from  Keynes’  most  important  work  into  successive  editions  of  the 
PEM. We believe Gudin’s textbook was fairly up-to-date compared with textbooks such as Tarshis’ (1947) 
and Samuelson’s (1948). Although the  first edition  of the  PEM did  not present  any  ideas from Keynes’ 
most  influential  work,  the  GT,  no  other  textbook  at  that  time—1943—had  incorporated  Keynesian 
arguments either. It was only in the third edition’s new second volume that Gudin presented Keynes’ and 
Keynesian  ideas  in  a  more  systematic  manner.  However,  unlike  Tarshis  (1947)  and  Samuelson  (1948), 
Gudin commented on the presented theories in a critical fashion. Moreover, he did not present the standard 
version  of  the  model  that  was  the  hallmark  of  the  Keynesian  tradition—the  IS-LM  model  based  on 
Modigliani’s  1944  article.  Rather,  the  Keynesian  theories  presented  by  Gudin  in  the  1952  edition  were 
those of the Hicks–Hansen period of Keynesianism. 

Our paper contributes to the literature on the transmission of economic thought by elucidating how 
the most  important  free-market advocate  of mid-20th century Brazil  introduced Keynes’ and Keynesian 
ideas to that country. As already mentioned, studies that have presented Gudin as a pioneering economist 
that transmitted Keynes’ and Keynesian ideas to Brazil did not examine this transmission in detail. While 
Gudin could not exactly ignore Keynes’ and Keynesian arguments when writing a textbook about monetary 
economics, he did not abandon his radical liberal thinking and resolved to present these new theories in a 
critical  way.  As  Boianovsky  (2012,  286)  wrote  about  Latin  American  monetarists,  economists  such  as 
Gudin  not  only  imported  theories from abroad, but  also transformed them to the  contexts in which they 

 

 

lived.  Through  his  important  textbook,  Gudin  thus  introduced  Keynes  to  the  Brazilian  audience,  while 
maintaining a critical attitude faithful to his radical free-market leanings.

 

1. The then-University of Brazil is now named the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. 

2. The opposition between developmentalists and free-market advocates continues to divide the Brazilian 

economics profession. For more details on the controversy, see Simonsen and Gudin (2010) and Teixeira, 

Maringoni, and Gentil (2010). About Roberto Simonsen, see Curi (2015) and Cavalieri and Curado (2016). 

English-language literature about developmentalism in Brazil is scarce; however, Love (1995, 1996) and 

Schneider (2015) provided a glimpse of the movement against which Gudin defended his free-market agenda. 

3. Giraud (2014) and Pearce and Hoover (1995) made a similar endeavour in relation to Paul Samuelson’s main 

textbook, Economics, first published in 1948. 

4. In the preface, Gudin already stated his intention to publish a second volume in the subsequent edition (Gudin 

1943, XXIII). Nonetheless, the second volume would be published only with the third edition in 1952. 

5. In 1937, Getúlio Vargas had already been governing Brazil as a dictator for seven years. He led a “coup within 

the coup” in 1937, alleging that communists were planning to take power in Brazil. After this coup, Vargas 

governed Brazil until 1945. Vargas’ dictatorship between 1937 and 1945—the Estado Novo—was 

undoubtedly harsher against any political and ideological opposition than it had been between 1930 and 1937. 

6. This is a two-volume edition. As Gudin had been writing the second volume since the late 1940s, he published 

this complementary volume in 1952, before the new third edition of the first volume. The new third edition of 

the first volume, which is roughly a new edition of the book published in 1947, was published only in 1954. 

After an unsuccessful search for a first volume published in 1952, we found a letter from 1953, in which 

Gudin explained to Jacob Viner the publishing of the first volume of the third edition was two years late 

(Gudin to Viner, December 24, 1953, Viner Papers, Box 12, Folder 15). 

7. Laidler (1999) emphasised Hansen’s role in building the Keynesian paradigm. 

8. The third one is Lawrence Klein. 

9. According to Tily (2007, 111), although Robertson opposed many of Keynes’ ideas, he played an important role 

in the Keynesian Revolution, which remains predominantly unrecognised. 

10. Dennis Robertson coined this term in 1936 (Boianovsky 2004, 92). 

11. Gudin did not cite Modigliani’s famous 1944 article in the PEM’s third edition. 

12. See Rubin (2004) for the argument that Modigliani was the emblematic IS-LM’s author. 

13. Throughout Gudin’s career, Jacob Viner had been a close friend and the main correspondent of the Brazilian 

economist with whom he discussed economics in personal correspondence.
