Abstract 

 
This  paper  comes  up  with  different  underlying  structures  of  explanatory  variables,  one  for 
each  country,  which  drive  changes  in  Sovereign  CDS  (Credit  Default  Swap)  spreads  by 
means  of  a  time  series analysis  and  a  subsequent  cluster  analysis.  The  set  of  explanatory 
variables  comprises  indicators  for  the  states  of  the  global  and  local  economies,  proxies  of 
risk  premia,  and  other  financial  variables  such  as  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates.  We 
develop this study for a selected set of 33 investable markets, including developed as well as 
emerging  markets.  Empirical  results  for  emerging  countries  are  markedly  different  from 
developed countries both in terms of sensitivity to some global factors and forecast accuracy 
of the estimations.

1. Introduction 

 

As the market of sovereign CDS (Credit Default Swap) is increasing in size and importance, 
so  is  the  interest  in  further  the  understanding  of  what  drives  the  variation  in  CDS  spreads. 
CDS’s  are  particularly  useful  to  a  wide  range  of  investors,  either  for  hedging  existing 
exposures  or  for  more  speculative  activities,  as  they  don’t  need  to  have  the  reference 
obligation in its books. 

As investors are increasingly focused on international diversification, they may be  willing to 
broaden their understanding on issues that impact the sovereign debt and CDS markets (see 
Alsakka  and  Gwilym,  2010).  This  may  be  even  more  the  case  now,  in  the  wake  of  a 
sovereign  bond  crisis  which  in  October  2009  engulfed  Greece,  one  year  later  embraced 
Ireland  and  in  May  2011  reached  Portugal.  Since  the  financial  bailout  of  the  Greek 
government  in  May  2010,  investors  have  been  putting  pressure  on  countries  with  high 
indebtedness and low growth prospects. As investors demand higher yields for buying their 
sovereign bonds, their sovereign CDS spreads increase in tandem. Then, funding costs have 
been  driven  up  to  the  point  of  making  borrowing  from  the  market  very  difficult  for  some 
governments. This is the case of governments of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, which ended 
up asking for financial assistance from IMF and European Union. 

The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of global and local market-related factors 
on  changes  in  Sovereign  CDS  spreads.  We  develop  this  study  for  a  selected  set  of  33 
investable markets, including developed as well as emerging markets1. For this purpose, we 
use  econometric  of  time  series  analysis  and  a  cluster  analysis.  In  the  cluster  analysis, 
countries  are  sorted  into  groups  where  the  members  of  each  group  are  as  similar  as 
possible. It is important to emphasize, however, that we don’t aim to provide any framework 
for  predicting  crisis,  but  to  suggest  a  useful  approach  for  short-term  horizon  investment 
decisions. Our paper is more related to Longstaff et al. (2010), but differentiates from theirs 
in  some  important  aspects:  i)  as  our  focus  is  on  asset  allocation,  an  extensive  set  of 
investable  sovereigns  are  included  in  our  analysis;  ii)  the  data frequency  is  weekly;  and  iii) 
we compare results of developed against emerging market sovereigns. 

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 revises the related literature; Section 3 presents 
a short description of the CDS market; on Section 4 we describe the data; Section 5 provides 
the empirical strategy and results; and finally Section 6 concludes the paper. 

 

2. Related Literature 

 
This paper relates more closely to Longstaff et al. (2010)2. They find that sovereign credit is 
primarily  driven  by  global  macroeconomic  forces  external  to  the  country  and  that  the  risk 
premium  represents  about  a  third  of  the  credit  spread.  64%  of  the  variations  in  sovereign 
credit spreads are accounted by a single principal component and those variations are more 
significantly  explained  by  U.S.  stock,  high-yield  markets  and  volatility  risk  premium 
(embedded in the VIX index) than by local economic variables. Our paper, on the other hand, 
investigates  the  underlying  structure  of  explanatory  variables  for  a  sample  of  investable 
sovereigns with a focus on the short-term horizon.

While our focus is on the short-term determinants of sovereign risk, Remolona et al. (2008) 
are  concerned  on  pricing  mechanisms  for  sovereign  risk  and  propose  a  framework  for 
distinguishing  market-assessed  sovereign  risk  from  its  risk  premia.  They  use  a  dynamic 
panel  data  model  with  a  sample  covering  24  emerging  countries’  sovereign  CDS  spreads. 
We believe we can provide a more comprehensive understanding of recent developments as 
our  sample  covers  a  period  during  which  Sovereign  CDS  turned  into  a  more  mature  and 
liquid  market  and  our  sample  covers  not  only  emerging  countries,  but  also  developed 
countries,  summing  up  33  countries.  Moreover,  we  assume  that  variation  in  risk  premia 
component  of  spreads  is  partially,  if  not  fully,  captured  by  the  explanatory  variables  (local 
stock exchange index, local short term yield or local term premium). 

 

3. Description of CDS market 

 
Sovereign CDS’s are a growing part of the CDS market. The Sovereign CDS market grew3 in 
fast pace since December 2004, from $0.17 trillion to almost $2.4 trillion in terms of notional 
amounts  outstanding4  in  July  2010,  while  the  increase  of  the  whole  market  of  credit 
derivatives  was  from  $6  trillion  to  $30  trillion  in  the  same  period.  Figure  1  shows  that 
positions  in  sovereign  contracts  have  been  increasing  since  December  2004,  while  for  the 
credit derivatives market as a whole, total notional amounts outstanding declined in the last 
five  periods.  According  to  BIS,  these  declines  are  largely  due  to  terminations  of  existing 
contracts, by netting gross notional outstanding through portfolio compression and clearing. 

Calculated  as  a  percentage  of  the  notional  value  of  the  reference  obligation,  CDS  spreads 
are the cost of benefiting from an insurance-like contract against default of a reference entity. 
The protection buyer pays a premium or spread on a periodic basis and in exchange, upon 
the occurrence of a credit event (defined within the terms of a CDS contract) has the right to 
sell  the  bond  to  the  protection  seller  at  face  value.  Then,  it  is  considered  an  efficient  and 
liquid  instrument  for  market  participants  to  mitigate  the  concentration  of  credit  risk  and  to 
enable  credit  providers  to  diversify  exposure  and  expand  lending  capacity.  The  protection 
seller,  on  the  other  hand,  can  take  credit  exposure  over  a  customised  term  and  earn  the 
premium without having to fund the position. The required premium is related to the expected 
loss of the bond; the higher the expected loss is, the higher the premium is expected to be. 
Moreover, CDS spreads may be useful for gauging the market perception of credit conditions 
of specific names, as they provide timelier assessments than rating agencies. 

A Sovereign CDS contract has some specificity regarding the triggering credit event and the 
reference  obligation.  The  credit  event  may  be  a  failure-to-pay,  a  moratorium  or  a 
restructuring. A failure-to-pay occurs when a government fails to pay more of its obligations 
in an amount at least as large as the payment requirement after any applicable grace period. 
A moratorium occurs when an authorized officer of the reference entity disclaims, repudiates, 
rejects  or  challenges  the  validity  of  one  or  more  obligations  and,  after  a  pre-defined  time 
lapse,  there  is  effectively  a  failure-to-pay  event  or  a  restructuring.  The  restructuring  occurs 
when  there  is  a  reduction,  postponement  or  deferral  of  obligation  principal;  when 
contractually  agreed  interest  payments  are  not  permitted  by  the  original  terms  of  the 
obligation;  when  there  is  a  change  in  priority  ranking  causing  subordination  to  another 
obligation;  or  when  there  is  a  change  in  currency  or  composition  of  interest  or  principal 
payments to any currency which is not a permitted currency.

4 Notional amounts outstanding are defined as the gross nominal or notional value of all deals concluded and not yet settled on 
the reporting date. These amounts provide a measure of market size and a reference from which contractual payments are 
determined in derivatives markets.

Upon  default,  there  are  two  types  of  settlement:  physical  settlement  and  cash  settlement. 
Both  of  them  cause  the  termination  of  the  contract.  In  case  of  physical  settlement,  the 
protection  buyer  delivers  to  the  protection  seller  one  of  a  list  of  bonds  with  equivalent 
seniority  rights  and  the  protection  seller  pays  to  the  protection  buyer  the  face  value  of  the 
debt.  In  case  of  cash  settlement,  the  protection  seller  pays  to  the  protection  buyer  the 
difference between the face value of the debt and its current market value. 

 

4. Data 

 

The  data  sample  comprises  a  set  of  time  series  of  33  investment-class  markets5.  The 
dependent variable of the estimation for each country is the change in its CDS spreads. The 
characteristics  of  the  CDS’s  are  the  following:  the  maturity  is  5-year  and  the  reference 
obligation is a deliverable senior dollar-denominated external debt of the sovereign. In Table 
2, we show descriptive statistics for the sovereign CDS spreads. 

On the explanatory variables, we select a set of market-sensitive ones, to the extent that they 
embed  economic  reasoning  for  investors  taking  short-term  decisions  on  sovereign  debt 
allocation. We classify them as global factors and local factors. Their description, economic 
reasoning and data source are thoroughly informed in Table 3. It is worth mentioning that we 
are  not  concerned  on  disentangling  and  assigning  the  specific  effects  one  variable  can 
convey  and,  instead,  consider  that  in  the  end  we  choose  a  sub-set  of  variables  that 
expresses  views  on  debt, tax  revenue  and  risk premium  in  aggregate. U.S. Term  Premium 
and  Local  Term  Premium,  for  example,  not  only  provide  indirect  assessment  on  future  tax 
revenues,  as  they  are  related  to  growth  prospects  through  the  business  cycle,  but  also 
capture risk premia embedded in long term yields. The global factors inform the state of the 
global economy on growth prospects, risk aversion, perception of counterparty risk within the 
banking  system  and  business  cycle:  log  difference  of  S&P  500  index,  log  difference  of  VIX 
index, first difference of TED spread, first difference of U.S. term premium and log difference 
, vix , ted ,TP and  oil . 
of  oil  price.  The  acronyms  for  these  factors  are,  respectively:
The  local  factors  should  each  provide,  in  theory,  information  on  specific  aspects  related  to 
debt,  tax  revenue  and  risk  premium:  lagged  dependent  variable  (first  difference  of  CDS 
spreads), log difference of local stock index, log difference of exchange rate, first difference 
of  local  short term  yield, first  difference  of  local  term  premium  and  log  difference  of foreign 
localTY , 
reserves.  The  acronyms  for  these  factors  are,  respectively:

The dependent and explanatory variables are sampled as weekly changes from July 2005 to 
July  2010.  All  observations  refer  to  end-of-the-day  quoted  prices.  The  use  of  weekly  data, 
however,  prevents  us  to  use  other  related  sovereign  credit-related  factors,  like  deficit/GDP 
and  debt/GDP  ratios,  which  are  available  only  on  a  quarterly  basis.  We  estimate  the 
econometric models for a  time  period  encompassing the  pre-2007  crisis and  crisis  periods. 
The pre-crisis period is from July 2005 to November 2007, the crisis period, from December 
2007 to June 2009 and the post-crisis period is from July 2009 to July 2010. The end of in-
sample period is based on the NBER’s (National Bureau of Economic Research) Committee 
announcement6, in which it states that the recession that began in December 2007 ended in

June  2009.  Then,  the  estimation  period  is  from  July  2005  to  June  2009. We  use  the  post-
crisis period as an out-of-sample period for calculating goodness-of-fit statistics.  

Variable  transformations  are  such  that  “interest  rate”  variables  are  transformed  into 
percentage values, i.e., CDS spreads, originally in basis points, are divided by 100; the other 
“interest rate” variables are already in percentage format (TED spread, U.S. Term Premium, 
Local Short-Term Yield and Local Term Premium). Then, we transform these variables into 
first differences. Moreover, “price” variables are transformed into ∆log(.): S&P 500 index, VIX 
index, Oil price, Local Stock Index, Exchange Rate and Foreign Reserves. 

 

5. Empirical Strategy and Results 

 

Our empirical strategy is to first select a set of eligible factors for each country. Secondly, we 
choose the best model for each country according to pre-defined set of criteria. 

In order to obtain the “best” model specification for each country, we first choose the sub-set 
of  eligible  factors  for  each  country.  The  focus  on  a  smaller  set  of  testable  variables  is 
paramount  for  reducing  the  processing  time.  Then,  we  resort  to  the  Granger-causality  test 
(Granger, 1969) not only for assessing weak endogeneity, but mostly for limiting the sub-set 
of  eligible  local  explanatory  variables  to  endogenous  and  exogenous  variables.  When 
estimating  models  with  all  the  variables  in  contemporaneous  form,  one  primary  concern  is 
endogeneity.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  exchange  rate,  changes  in  this  factor  may 
anticipate  changes  in  CDS  spreads.  On  the  other  hand,  currency  devaluation  may  be 
consequence of deteriorating economic fundamentals, i.e., if the public debt is perceived to 
be  unsustainable  in  the  short  term,  the  government  may  pursue  currency  depreciation  in 
order  to  soften  the  burden  of  servicing  the  debt.  Then,  in  order  to  circumvent  endogeneity 
issues,  we  run  GMM  estimations  with  instrumental  variables  for  the  endogenous  variables. 
When the variable is considered exogenous, we simply use it as instrument for itself; for the 
endogenous  ones,  we  use  their  first  lags  as  instruments.  Non-exogenous  and  non-
endogenous variables are not considered in the model specification. Therefore, by restricting 
the  testable  model  specifications  to  combinations  of  only  endogenous  and  exogenous 
variables, we can filter out some model specifications and save computational cost. Table 5 
summarizes Table 4 showing the sub-set of eligible variables for each country, marked with 
labels  “(*)”,  “*”  and  “&”.  Parts  A  and  B  of  Table  4  show  chi-squared  statistics  for  testing, 
respectively:  i)  whether  local  variables  anticipate  changes  in  CDS  spreads,  and  ii)  whether 
the  opposite  holds  true.  A  variable  is  deemed  eligible  when  it  is  weakly  exogenous  or 
endogenous. When the statistic is non-significant at 10% in Part A, then the corresponding 
variable  is  not  eligible.  Weak  exogeneity  is  attributed  to  a  variable  when  the  chi-squared 
statistic is 10% significant in Part A, but not in Part B. A variable is considered endogenous in 
case the chi-squared statistic is 10% significant both in Part A and Part B. In order to provide 
a clear view of the set of eligible variables, the weakly exogenous and endogenous variables 
are  marked  with  label  “*”  and  “&”,  respectively,  in  Table  5.  When  there  is  no  label,  the 
corresponding  variable  is  not  considered  as  eligible.  Variables  labelled  “(*)”  in  Table  5  are 
considered  exogenous  by  assumption,  i.e.,  the  global  variables  and  the  first  lag  of  the 
dependent variable are not due to be affected by the dependent variable in any sense for any 
country in the sample. 

 

 

 

5/25 

In  the  second  step,  we  select7  the  model  specification  for  each  country,  according  to  the 
following  criteria:  i)  expected  signs  according  to  Table  3,  ii)  at  least  two  10%-significant 
parameters,  iii)  highest  possible  number  of  parameters,  iv)  highest  Adjusted  R2  and  v) 
superior8  to  all  possible  nested9  models;  or  vi)  which  satisfies  conditions  i)  and  ii)  and  with 
Adjusted R2 higher than model’s satisfying conditions i), ii), iii), iv) and v). Blank cells in Table 
6  mean  that  models  including  the  corresponding  factor  are  superseded  by  the  prevailing 
model specification; or that the corresponding factor is just non-eligible. 

We  also  perform  a  cluster  analysis,  in  which  countries  are  sorted  into  groups  where  the 
members  of  each  group  are  as  similar  as  possible10.  At  the  same  time,  the  algorithm 
attempts to form the groups to be as dissimilar from one another as possible. In effect, the 
algorithm  tries  to  create  groupings  in  a  way  that  maximizes  the  average  distance  between 
countries  in  the  same  group,  while  minimizing  the  average  distance  between  countries  of 
different groups. 

Finally, we assess the goodness-of-fit of the estimations and their forecast accuracy. 

 

5.1 Results

The most striking result of Table 6 is that the global variables 
as  significant  estimators  for  most  of  the  countries,  but  also  that  there  is  a  difference  in 
sensitivity to these global factors between emerging markets and developing countries. Even 
for countries for which those global variables don’t show up (Austria, India and Hong Kong), 
we  find  that  the  estimators for  vix and

significant.  The  other  four  countries  significantly  sensitive  to 
Mexico and Thailand. This is also in line with the perception that government debt riskiness 
of these countries are linked to the dynamics of the general state of the local economy and 
that the local stock exchange is a very important driver for these local economies. Besides, 
no local variable shows up as significant for more than half12 (19) of the sample of countries. 
Moreover, for 17 out of 19 of these countries (exceptions are New Zealand and Poland), only 
sp
and oil are significant. One can argue that for these sovereigns (one third of them are 
developed European countries and the remaining is mostly comprised of investment-grade13 
European  and  Asian  countries  –  except  for  Greece  and  Indonesia),  the  main  driver  is  the 
general state of the global economy. The pervasiveness of global factors is consistent with 
the  results  obtained  by  other  authors  (Longstaff  et  al.  2010;  Pan  and  Singleton,  2008).

and clustering the non-null values into 
market countries. Taking estimator values for 
two groups leads us to results in Table 7. Statistics in Table 8 just supports the choice of the 
number  of  clusters,  as  the  two-group  solution  with  a  Calinski-Harabasz  (1974)  pseudo-F 
value14  of  59.21  is  the  largest,  indicating  that  this  grouping  solution  is  the  most  distinct 
compared with three-group and four-group solutions. Moreover, as expected, we observe a 
clear-cut  separation  between  emerging  market  and  developed  countries.  The  results  are 
similar  for  non-null  estimator  values  of  oil ,  in  the  sense  that  a  group  of  emerging  market 
countries cluster together distinctively as well.

Another interesting finding is that Brazil and Turkey appear in Table 6 with 
and local 
short term yield being significant drivers of riskiness perception of their debts. One common 
characteristic of these countries is that they are used to figure in the top list of countries with 
high  nominal  interest  rates.  Therefore,  any  move  in  the  policy  rate,  which  is  tracked  very 
closely  by  short  term  yields,  can  cause  a  relevant  impact  on  the  domestic  bond  and  stock 
markets and non-domestic derivative markets, like the sovereign CDS market. If a history of 
high indebtedness and debt restructurings is any guide, this conciliates with the view that an 
increasingly  high  short  term  yield  signals  that  the  sovereign  may  be  struggling  to  attract 
investors  to  fund  its  fiscal  deficit.  This  is  due  to  lead  protection  sellers  to  charge  higher 
premiums  on  CDS  contracts  with  those  debts  as  reference  obligations.  Moreover,  both 
countries  share  a  history  of  struggle  against  inflation.  According  to  Blanchard  (2005),  for 
example, in 2002 and 2003, fiscal dominance regime prevailed within the Brazilian economy, 
where  the  monetary  policy  turned  to  be  ineffective  for  inflation  control  and,  even  worse,  a 
raise  of  the  policy  rate  was  signaling  high  riskiness  of  exchange  rate  devaluation.  In  this 
case,  the  realization  of  currency  depreciation  led  to  a  reduction  in  value  of  local  currency 
denominated public debt in dollar terms to the detriment of debtholders. Still consistent with 
the positive sign for the estimators, the opposite seems to hold true recently, i.e., short term 
yields  have  been  declining  in  those  countries  and  CDS  spreads  have  also  been  declining 
accordingly. 

The fact that  ted doesn’t show up as significant may be due to the general assessment that, 
mainly for countries within the Euro zone and other developed countries, the transmission of 
distress  from  the  banking  sector  to  sovereign  credit  deterioration  may  occur  more  like  a 
structural break than continuously in time. When the  ted increases, banks may be not even 
relying on each other that short term loan will be repaid in full. Our ex-ante expectation was 
that  increases  in  ted ,  as  a stress  indicator15  of  the  banking  sector, could  have, from  some 
moment,  continuously  contaminated  risk  perception  of  sovereign  bonds.  It  is  worth 
mentioning that  ted effects are not captured by other global variables, like 
or  oil , as 
their pair-wise correlations are not high: -12% and -15%, respectively. Thus, the underpricing 
of the spillover effect from the financial stability stance to the sovereign debt risk during the 
period  leading  to  the  2007-2009  crisis  can  be  tentatively  explained  by  a  reliance  that 
governments would: i) monetize their debts (this may be more the case of United States, but 
less the case of Euro-zone country members), ii) wipe out defaulted bank’s shareholders and 
subordinated  debtholders,  or  iii)  be  simply  rescued  by  economically  stronger  sovereigns. 
Anyway,  sovereign  risk  may  deteriorate  abruptly,  once  none  of  those  issues  are 
appropriately addressed. In Iceland and Ireland, for example, problems in the banking sector

after  a  prolonged  period  during  which  those  problems  in  their  respective  financial  systems 
were well-known. In the case of the non-Euro zone member Iceland, although their citizens 
voted  against  repaying  depositors  in  United  Kingdom  and  Netherlands,  there  was  no 
sovereign debt restructuring as far as it is concerned. In the end, the IMF and the European 
Union  provided  financial  assistance  to  Iceland  and  Ireland  and  CDS  spreads  referencing 
their debts receded as a result.

Colombia  is  one  of  a  few  countries  showing  significant  positive  estimator  of
evidence  stands  as  supportive  to  the  hypothesis  that  the  currency  channel  plays  a  role  in 
determining market perception of sovereign credit risk. Colombia is a special case, because 
it suffered a recession in 1999, in the wake of the currency crisis in Russia and Brazil, which 
threatened  debtholders  with  a  possibility  of  debt  restructuring.  According  to  Clavijo  (2004), 
over  the  years  1999-2002,  the  exchange  rate  depreciated  by  about  20%  in  real  effective 
terms.  It  is  argued  that  the  stability  of  real  exchange  rate  and    the  inflation  control  were 
achieved  by  the  implementation  of monetary  and  exchange rate  policies  during  this  period. 
More recently, imports, exports, and the overall balance of trade are at significant levels, and 
the inflow of export dollars has resulted in a substantial re-valuation of the Colombian peso. 
Its sovereign credit risk is being priced at lower levels, accordingly.

premium  and  foreign  reserves  may  be  encompassed  by  changes  in ixr   and 
Moreover,  our  time  series  of  foreign  reserves  are  obtained  as  interpolation  of  the  original 
data  available  only  on  a  monthly  basis.  Then,  this  treatment  of  missing  values  for  foreign 
reserves may be one reason why we don’t obtain significant estimators for this variable. 

i

Next, we follow through a goodness-of-fit analysis by  identifying clusters and by comparing 
estimation results of models with lagged explanatory variables and ARMA structural models. 

 

5.2 Robustness Check 
We assess the goodness-of-fit of the estimations by means of Adjusted R2, PMAD (Percent 
Mean  Absolute  Deviation)  and  PHM  (Percent  Hit  Misses).  Adjusted  R2’s  are  calculated  for 
the  in-sample  period,  whereas  PMAD  and  PHM,  for  out-of-sample  period.  As  a  test  of 
forecast  accuracy,  we  believe  that  the  assessment  using  PMAD  is  more  intuitive  than 
squared  errors  (SE),  since  it  is  the  average  value  of  the  error  in  absolute  terms  as 
percentage  of the  average  value  of  the realized  value  also  in  absolute  terms.  PHM,  on  the 
other hand, stands as an assessment of whether the direction of the prediction is accurate or 
not, i.e.: 

PHM #=

HitMisses

. 

N

#

=  number  of  times  the  prediction  does  not  have  the  same  sign  as  the 

where  HitMisses
realized value and N = total number of observations. 
While for Adjusted R2, the higher it is, the better, for PMAD and PHM, we should expect low 
values. 

Clustering  results  of  Table  9  suggest  that  changes  in  CDS  spreads  for  emerging  market 
countries as a class, especially for those within clusters in the lower part of table, show more 
potential for prediction than spreads of developed countries. Data in Table 9 are essentially a 
rearrangement  of  goodness-of-fit  measures  of  Table  6,  but  with  each  column  sorted  in 
ascending  or  descending  order  depending  on  the  measure.  Countries  in  the  lowest  part  of 

 

 

 

8/25 

the table are associated to better goodness-of-fit measures. Then, we define the number of 
clusters  and  their  members  by  means  of  Calinski-Harabasz  (1974)  stopping  rule16.  The 
numbers of groups are robust to Calinski-Harabasz pseudo-F index stopping rule, according 
to Table 10. For Adjusted R2, the highest index value is assigned to three as the number of 
clusters.  For  both  PMAD  and  PHM,  we  parsimoniously  choose  four  as  the  number  of 
clusters.  Results  show  that  the  best  performing  clusters  at  the  three  goodness-of-fit 
measures  (those  at  the  lowest  part  of  the  Table  9)  are  essentially  comprised  of  emerging 
market countries (except for Japan in the PMAD clustering). Their adjusted R2’s are relatively 
high and their PHM’s are low. Their PMAD’s, however, are not low in absolute terms, but still 
lower than PMAD’s of developed countries. Moreover, Colombia stands out as the common 
country across those best performing clusters. 

When we estimate the models for each country with exactly the same explanatory variables 
as  in  Table  6,  but  with  these  variables  in  lags,  the  results  are  less  robust  in  terms  of 
and oil  
significance of parameters and goodness-of-fit as expected. Taking results of 
in  Table  11,  we  observe  that  much  less  estimators  show  up  as  significant.  Statistically 
significant local variables are even less numerous in comparison to Table 6. Besides, except 
for a few cases (five out of 97), all the the goodness-of-fit metrics are comprehensively better 
for models in Table 6.

We proceed with ARMA modelling according to Box-Jenkins (1994) and Enders (2004). The 
ARMA(p,q)  process 
(Full-Information  Maximum  Likelihood 
Estimation). The best model is selected if: i) the AR and MA terms are 10% significant; ii) the 
residuals behave as a white-noise process (in which all autocorrelations should be zero), iii) 
it  has  the  lowest  BIC  (Bayesian  Information  Criteria)  statistic,  iv)  it  is  non-degenerate,  i.e., 
there are no gaps within AR or MA terms and v) when i) and ii) don’t hold, then only criteria 
iii) and iv) are taken into consideration. We use Ljung-Box (1978) Q-statistic in equation (2) 
at 10% significance level for testing the ii) hypothesis.

Results  of  Table  12  don’t  allow  us  to  affirm  that  pure  time  series-based  models  are 
consistently better than fundamental-based models or whether the opposite holds true. While 
adjusted  R2’s  and  PHM’s  are,  respectively,  better  for  70%  and  55%  of  the  countries  in 
comparison with the same statistics as reported in Table 11, PMAD’s are higher only for 36%

The  empirical  evidence  is  strongly  supportive  of  the  models  presented  in  Table  6.  The 
estimators  of  important  global  variables  (S&P500  and  Oil  price)  are  comprehensively 
significant,  whereas  Local  Stock  Exchange,  Exchange  Rate  and  Local  Short  Term  Yield 
show  up  with  significant  estimators  and  with  correct signs for  selected  important  investable 
emerging  market  countries.  Moreover,  goodness-of-fit  and  forecasting  accuracy  are  much 
better  for  a  sub-set  of  emerging  markets  than  for  developed  countries.  As  we  expected, 
models  with  contemporaneous  variables  are  consistently  better  than  with  lagged  variables, 
both in terms of significance of estimators and goodness-of-fit. Nonetheless, when analysing 
models  with  lagged  variables,  one  cannot  affirm  that  goodness-of-fit  and  forecasting 
accuracy are better for fundamental-based models than for ARMA structural models. 

If the past is any guide (so far we believe it is!) and investment decisions are due to be taken 
on a weekly basis, one may consider choosing specific sovereigns for trading credit default 
swaps  with  their  bonds  as  reference  obligations  and  pursuing  the  proposed  econometric-
based  framework  for  forecasting  their  spreads.  In  order  to  use  this  framework  in  practice, 
however,  one  must  consider  some  caveats.  Models  with  contemporaneous  variables  need 
one-week-ahead  predictions  as  inputs.  In  this  case,  results  of  Table  6  suggest  that 
forecasting  efforts  should  be  focused  on  global  variables  in  the  first  stage,  particularly 
S&P500  and  Oil  price.  Moreover,  the  same  caveat  mentioned  by  Longstaff  et  al.  (2010) 
applies here: the period of analysis is “characterized by excess global liquidity, prevalence of 
carry trades and reaching for yield in the sovereign market”. 

For future research, one may consider testing other banking sector-related factors or models 
with dummy variables. The well-functioning of the banking sector is essential to fostering the 
economic development of any country, while the opposite holds true as well: banking crisis 
can lead to economic recession. Therefore, distresses in the banking sector, when pervasive 
and  reaching  too-systemic-to-fail  firms,  like  the  one  that  happened  during  the  2007-2009 
crisis, may lead to negative views on the debt sustainability of the corresponding sovereign. 
In  this  sense,  whether  for  paving  the  way  for  economic  growth  or  where  having  a  specific 
mandate of guaranteeing financial stability, central banks, as lenders of last resort, have an 
incentive for recuing the banking sector. In our paper, we use  ted as a proxy for distress in 
the banking sector, but it doesn’t show up as significant. We conjecture that Sovereign CDS 
spreads  may  not  have  captured  distress  from  the  banking  sector,  as  its  transmission  to 
sovereign  credit  deterioration  may  occur  more  like  a  structural  break  than  continuously  in 
time.  This  hypothesis  should  be  more  rigorously  tested  by  including  a  dummy  variable  or 
other banking-related variables. 

As  an  additional  robustness  check,  we  recommend  undertaking  randomization  tests  on 
selected  set  of  explanatory  variables  and  compare  the  forecast  accuracy  ex-post.  For 
example,  if  60%  of  predictions  of  changes  in  S&P500  had  been  correct,  what  would  have 
been the value for PHM (Percent Hit Misses)?

Table 3 – Description of Explanatory Variables 

Description and Economic Reasoning 

First difference of CDS spread of country  i : These spreads are the last 
price for five-year senior dollar-denominated CDS contracts. This is the 
dependent variable in the estimation and its lag is also included as 
explanatory variable in the estimation. 
∆log of Standard & Poor’s 500 Index: it is a gauge of the general state of 
the global economy. 
∆log of VIX Index: VIX is a measure of market's expectation of stock market 
volatility. The positive variation of this index is associated with higher 
uncertainty and risk aversion among investors. 
First difference of TED spreads: this spread is the difference between the 
three-month interest rates on interbank loans (LIBOR) and three-month 
U.S. government debt (OIS – Overnight Indexed Swap). The higher is the 
positive change of this spread, the less willing banks are to lend to each 
other. 
First difference of U.S. Term Premium: term premium is the difference 
between the interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond and three-month 
U.S. Treasury Bills. It provides prospective information on the business 
cycle of the global economy. U.S. term premium is influenced positively by 
economic growth and by inflationary expectations; it is influenced 
negatively by risk aversion. 
∆log of Oil Price: Oil price is last quoted price of the day of the London 
Brent Crude Oil Index. In general, increasing oil prices reflects both the 
surging of global economic activity or the impact of production shortfalls. 
Focusing on the demand side, when the pace of economic expansion picks 
up, so are expected to increase world demand in general for energy and for 
oil in particular. In this sense, changes in oil prices may be considered a 
better indicator for the state of the global economy than changes in S&P 
500 or VIX indices 
∆log of Local Stock Exchange Index: this index is expected to rise or 
remain stable when companies and the economy in general show signs of 
stability and growth. It is expected to decrease in periods of crisis. Then, it 
is an indicator generally used to gauge the health of an economy. 
∆log of Exchange Rate: the last-price-of-the-day exchange rates are 
expressed in units of local currency per U.S. dollar. One may argue that 
currency devaluation may lead to additional charges for dollar-denominated 
indebted countries and for countries with negative balance of trade and 
highly dependent on import of manufactured products. On the other hand, 
as an indicator of relative international price competitiveness, currency 
devaluation may lead to high benefits derived from international trade. 
First difference of the One-To-Three-Year Local Bond Yield: the yield refers 
to the local currency denominated fixed rate government debt. All bond 
prices are mid rates and are taken at the close of business in the local 
office for all markets. In general, high short term yields negatively impact 
growth prospects in the near future. Moreover, an increasingly high short 
term yield signals that the country may be struggling to attract investors to 
fund its expenses. 
First difference of Local Term Premium: local term premium is the 
difference between the interest rates on Seven-To-Ten-Year and One-To-
Three-Year Local Bond Yields. It provides prospective information on the 
business cycle of the local economy. When the premium becomes small or 
negative, it indicates a slowdown in economic activity in the foreseeable 
future. On the other hand, higher term premium suggests expectations of 
increasing economic growth or that investors may be requiring additional 
discount on long term bonds to account for liquidity risk. 
∆log of Foreign Reserves: foreign reserves are the dollar values of foreign 
currency holdings. Weekly values are calculated by linear interpolation of 
monthly values. It is considered a protection against withdrawal of foreign 
funding.

Table 4 – Granger Causality Test 
Each column in Part A shows the chi-squared statistics with n degrees of freedom (

2

nχ ) for the hypothesis test that the 

corresponding factor 

tf  does not “Granger cause” the first difference of CDS spreads of the country in the corresponding row. 

The Granger causality test is a Wald test on the restrictions that the

lβ ’s are jointly zero at the estimation of equation:

. ‘N’ accounts for the number of countries in each column for which the chi-squared 

statistic is 10% significant. Part B shows the chi-squared statistics for whether the opposite holds true, i.e., for the hypothesis 
test that the first difference of CDS spreads of the country in the corresponding row does not “Granger cause” the corresponding 
lδ ’s are jointly zero at the estimation of equation:

Table 6 – GMM Results 

 
This table reports, for each country, statistical results of models: i) with expected signs according to Table 3, ii) with at least two 
10%-significant parameters, iii) with the highest number of parameters, iv) with highest Adjusted R2 and v) superior to all 
possible nested models; or vi): which satisfies conditions i) and ii) and with Adjusted R2 higher than model’s satisfying 
conditions i), ii), iii), iv) and v). The dependent variable is the first difference of CDS spreads. All the global and local variables 
are considered for the estimation. Goodness-of-fit statistics are calculated for estimation sample (July 2005 to June 2009) and 
out-of-sample periods (July 2009 to July 2010). Only combinations of explanatory variables labelled with “(*)”, “*” and “&” in 
Table 5 are considered as possible estimation models. The first lag of local variable is used as instrument for the corresponding 
local variable labelled with “&” in Table 5. Variables transformations are such that we apply ∆log(.) to “price” variables (S&P 500 
index, VIX index, Oil price, Local Stock Index, Exchange Rate and Foreign Reserves) and ∆(.) to “interest rate” variables (TED 
spread, U.S. Term Premium, CDS spreads, Local Short-Term Yield and Local Term Premium). The variance-covariance 
matrices are estimated according to White (1980) robust estimation. Local Term Premium and Foreign Reserves don’t show up 
as significant for any country.

Table 11 – GMM Results with Lagged Explanatory Variables 

 
This table reports, for each country, statistical results of models with the same explanatory variables as in Table 6, but in lags. 
The dependent variable is the first difference of CDS spreads. Goodness-of-fit statistics are calculated for estimation sample 
(July 2005 to June 2009) and out-of-sample periods (July 2009 to July 2010). The explanatory variable itself is used as 
instrument for the GMM estimation. Variables transformations are such that we apply ∆log(.) to “price” variables (S&P 500 index, 
VIX index, Oil price, Local Stock Index, Exchange Rate and Foreign Reserves) and ∆(.) to “interest rate” variables (TED spread, 
U.S. Term Premium, CDS spreads, Local Short-Term Yield and Local Term Premium). The variance-covariance matrices are 
estimated according to White (1980) robust estimation.

Determination of the Number of Clusters 
 
‘k’  is  the  number  of  clusters  to  be  tested.  For  determining  the  clusters,  we  define  the 
absolute-value  as  the  distance  measure.  i.e.,  countries  within  a  cluster  should  have  low 
distances among them and high distances between countries of different clusters. We apply 
the  absolute-value  to  two  metrics,  depending  on  the  partition:  one  based  on  medians  (for 
sp
and oil parameters – Table 7) and the other, on means (for goodness-of-fit measures 
–  Table  9).  Arbitrary  values  for  the  metrics  are  initially  set  for  each  cluster.  Then,  each 
observation  is  assigned  to  the  cluster  whose  metric  is  closest,  and  then  based  on  that 
classification,  new  cluster  metrics  are  determined.  These  steps  continue  until  no 
observations  change  clusters.  Finally,  we  need  to  compare  the  fitness  of  formed  clusters. 
According to Milligan and Cooper (1985), Calinski-Harabasz (1974) index is one of the best 
stopping rules for the determination of the number of clusters. The formula of the index is: 

500

where g is the number of clusters, N is total number of observations, B is the between-cluster 
sum of squares and cross-products matrix, and W is the within-cluster sum of squares and 
cross-products matrix. 
Large values of the index indicate distinct clustering.
