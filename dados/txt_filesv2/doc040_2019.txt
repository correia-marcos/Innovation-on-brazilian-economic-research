ABSTRACT 

 

This paper specifies an open economy dynamic applied general equilibrium model with government, public 
debt and heterogeneous households. We calibrate the model for the Brazilian economy and use it to study 
fiscal mix and public debt stabilization policies in the short and long term. Households are Ricardian or 
non-Ricardian depending to their access to financial markets, and we find that the welfare impact on them 
of the several fiscal policies can be quite different. Only two changes of fiscal mix imply gains for both, 
and  none  of  the  debt  consolidation  policies  are  desirable  for  both.  We  claim  that  heterogeneity  of 
households may lead to a lack of agreement with regards to public debt consolidation, political conflict in 
adoption of fiscal policies to control it, and chronic public debt accumulation.

RESUMO 

 

Este  artigo  apresenta  um  modelo  de  equilíbrio  geral  dinâmico  com  economia  aberta,  governo,  dívida 
pública e famílias heterogêneas. Nós calibramos o modelo para a economia brasileira e o utilizamos para 
estudar os efeitos, no curto e longo prazo, de políticas que alterem parâmetros fiscais e estabilizem a dívida 
pública. As famílias são Ricardianas ou não-Ricardianas, dependendo do acesso ao mercado financeiro, e 
os resultados indicam que o impacto das diferentes estratégias de política fiscal sobre o bem-estar delas 
pode ser bastante diferente. Apenas duas políticas que alteram os parâmetros fiscais implicam ganhos para 
ambas, e nenhuma das políticas de consolidação da dívida é desejável para ambas. Este estudo conclui que 
a  heterogeneidade  das  famílias  pode  levar  à  falta  de  concordância  em  relação  à  consolidação  da  dívida 
pública, ao conflito político na adoção de políticas fiscais para controlá-la e ao endividamento persistente.

Introduction 

 
In the last 20 years fiscal policy has faced several challenges in many countries around the world. 
In several cases public debt has increased significantly as a result of fiscal permissiveness in financing the 
increasing cost and breadth of social security, expansion and creation of social programs, development of 
large infrastructure projects, and of granting of subsidies, and of tax forfeiture.1 More recently, in many 
countries it has further increased by the use of debt financed expansionary policies used in response to the 
recessionary effects of the subprime crisis of 2008. The interest cost of the larger public debt has further 
aggravated the fiscal imbalance.  
 
Irrespective of its origin, the resulting disequilibrium has required the adoption of fiscal austerity 
programs to control the growth of public indebtedness. These policies, however, have a high social cost in 
the short and medium term, and their political acceptance is often complex, controversial and difficult. To 
assist  in  their  design  and  evaluation,  studies  have  been  undertaken  in  several  countries  to  prospectively 
assess their effectiveness, sustainability, and economic impact,  especially on growth.2 The present study 
aims to contribute to that literature, with special reference to Brazil.  
 
The  Brazilian  fiscal  problem  is  chronic,  as  shown  by  Giambiagi  and  Além  (2016).  The  last  five 
years have been marked by very large primary deficits, due to increases in public expenditure coupled with 
decreases in net tax revenue. The economic imbalance associated with it, the fiscal policies used to deal 
with  it  after  2016,  and  the  political  instability  in  the  country  associated  with  the  impeachment  of  the 
President of the Republic, are perceived by Barbosa Filho (2017) as the main factors responsible for the 
economic recession that lasted from 2014 to 2016, which was the country's second largest after the war.3 
Although the decline of GDP ceased in December 2016, real GDP expanded only 1% in 2017, and less than 
1,5% in 2018, and in the third trimester of 2018 its level was still 5,5% smaller than four years earlier (IBGE 
(2018)). These facts, coupled with the high real interest rate that prevails in the country, have led to very 
large increases in the relative size of the total gross public debt, which went from 55.5% of GDP in 2006 
to 77.3% of GDP in 2018, and may reach more than 92% of GDP in 2022 if the status quo fiscal policy is 
maintained (see IFI (2018)). The correlation of large public debt and slow growth is consistent with the 
empirical literature on the Reinhart-Rogoff effect (see Reinhart and Rogoff (2010, 2011) and Tourinho and 
Sangoi (2017)).  

The difficulty of formulating policies to restore fiscal balance, stabilize the public debt, and increase 
economic growth for Brazil today suggests the need to build models to design them. Such studies have been 
conducted for Brazil in the past (for example, see Tourinho, Mercês e Costa (2013) and Tourinho and Brum 
(2019)) as well as for other countries, in the representative agent framework. We use a DGE model based 
on Papageorgiou (2012) to discuss fiscal consolidation in Greece, but include several extensions that we 
deem  relevant  for the  Brazilian case.  These will  be discussed later after the main  characteristics of that 
model are summarized. 

It is a neoclassical model of exogenous economic growth where the technology displays decreasing 
marginal returns to factors and there is conditional convergence to the steady state, unlike the endogenous 
growth models with the AK technology (Rebelo (1990). Our choice of technology is based on the empirical 
evidence in Caselli, Esquivel and Lefort (1996) that rejects the absence of conditional convergence, which 
is  confirmed by  later studies.4 The structure of the  model  is  in essence  that  of Baxter and King (1993), 
where permanent increases in spending have a greater effect on output than temporary increases, and this 
effect is more significant when it is financed by a single (non-distorting) tax, and where the proper choice

2 For a survey on the effects of fiscal policy on growth see, for example, Zagler and Dürnecker (2003). 
3 The three worst recessions in postwar Brazil were (GDP declines in parenthesis): 1981-83 (-8.5%), 1989-92 (-7.7%) and 2014-
2016 (-8.2%) according to CODACE (2017).

of the adjustment instrument is crucial to determine its macroeconomic impact. It considers a CRRA utility 
function,  which  contemplates  non-unitary  intertemporal  substitution  elasticity,  admits  the  substitution 
between private and government consumption, and adopts a neoclassical production function that includes 
human capital and public capital in addition to private capital.  

As  in  Barro  and  Sala-i-Martin  (1993,  2004)  that  model  considers  a  wide  spectrum  of  fiscal 
instruments, and takes into account that the productive or unproductive nature of public spending, and the 
base of the tax used to finance it, are crucial for determining the impact of fiscal policy, both on steady state 
(EE) and in the transition (Aschauer (1989)).5 The model considers the possibility of occurrence of deficits 
and their financing by public debt, and concludes that a change in the fiscal mix that reduces the rate on 
labor income, with a compensating increase in the consumption tax rate is the best combination to stimulate 
economic  activity  and  obtain  welfare  gains,  while  maintaining  public  debt  on  a  sustainable  path.  The 
analysis  of  dynamic  fiscal  consolidation  programs  based  on  both  expenditure  control  and  tax  burden 
increases indicates that they negatively impact economic activity in the short term, but bring significant 
benefits when considering the total effect.  

Tourinho  and  Brum  (2018)  calibrated  Papageorgiou  (2012)  for  Brazil  used  it  to  study  debt 
stabilization. Our model refines it in several directions. First, it improves the calibration, investigating in 
further detail  the empirical  estimates of several  key  parameters. Second, it considers an open economy, 
including equations for the foreign sector and the balance of payments, which is important because it affects 
the Government’s fiscal balance through the flow of foreign savings. The discussion in the literature about 
the importance of the openness of the economy for stabilization and growth, and the vicissitudes of the twin 
deficit syndrome and the cursory examination of the recent cases of debt stabilization in Europe are ample 
enough reason to justify trying to overcome this limitation of that model. 6 Third, we extend the model to 
consider the presence of heterogeneous households, to try to explain why the adoption of fiscal policies to 
reduce the level or the rate of growth of public debt remains stubbornly difficult to implement in practice 
and is often riddled with disagreement, even when the models indicate that it would increase the level and 
the rate of growth of output and improve welfare. 

We argue that representative agent models do not capture the stylized fact that in many developing 
countries  there  is  significant  fraction  of  agents  that  are  “rule-of-thumb”  households  which  decide 
consumption on the basis of current income. According to Mankiw (2000), this behavior may be due to 
credit constraints. The assessment of a given debt consolidation program by the two types of households 
may  be  quite  different,  and  that  may  lead  to  disagreement  on  the  society  as  whole  with  regards  to  the 
desirability  of  reducing,  or  even  curbing,  public  indebtedness.  Therefore,  our  model  contemplates  the 
existence  of  Ricardian  and  non-Ricardian  households  (Campbell  and  Mankiw  (1989)).7  The  former  has 
access to the credit market and make consumption and investment decisions taking interest rate movements 
into consideration, while the latter's decisions are not affected by it. If their share is large, this difference in 
the behavior will alter in a significant manner the effect of interest rates on the real side of the economy 
and, therefore, its response to fiscal policies.8 To the extent that these two types of household correspond 
roughly to different income classes, this conflict over fiscal policies is a reflection of a distributive conflict, 
and results in a lack of consensus on the details  of the fiscal  consolidation plan, even after the need for 
adjustment has been established. This seems to be present in the case of Greece, Brazil, and other economies 
with severe income inequality. 

The literature has examined household heterogeneity and the effects of income inequality, but not 
quite in the same manner address the issue. García-Peñalosa and Turnovsky (2011) builds upon Turnovsky 
(1996, 1997) and specify  a neoclassical  growth  model in  which the labor supply is  endogenous and the 
                                                 
5 The effect of the composition of government expenditure in macroeconomic performance is studied further in Turnovsky and 
Fisher (1995). 
6 Surprisingly, Papageourgiou (2012) specifies a closed economy model for Greece. 
7 This approach to disaggregation of the households is broadly used, to study fluctuations in the neighborhood of the steady state 
with DSGE models, but here it is used to study the change of steady states and the transition trajectory between them.  
8 According to Gomes (2013), there are indications in the Brazilian economy that current income plays a fundamental role in 
determining  consumption,  which  would  be  associated  with  the  presence  of  consumers  that  face  credit  restrictions  and  are, 
therefore, unable to smooth consumption.

agents  have  different  initial  endowments  of  capital,  to  study  the  impact  of  tax  changes  on  dynamics  of 
wealth and income distribution. However, they go beyond the earlier studies in assuming a negative effect 
of wealth on labor supply.9 They emphasize the essential role that elastic labor supply has in determining 
these dynamics and found strong evidence of a trade-off between output growth and inequality. They find 
that  a  policy  where  the  government  uses  tax  rates  on  labor  income  to  increase  public  transfers  is  not 
recommended, because it reduces labor supply and, consequently, output, and the inequality is accentuated. 
It is better to finance transfers by increasing the tax rate on consumption, since it causes a smaller decrease 
in  the  level  of  output,  and  is  effective  in  reducing  income  inequality.  Extending  that  research,  García-
Peñalosa and Turnovsky (2015) assume that labor endowments are also heterogeneous, reflecting different 
skill levels that affect the distribution of earnings. They assume an intertemporal isoelastic utility function 
that  is  additively  separable  on  government  expenditure,  which  affects  private  utility  through  a  positive 
parameter. The results attest to the positive relationship between skill level and labor supply, and ratifies 
the importance of the elasticity of the labor supply.  

The  importance  of  using  formulations  that  consider  the  heterogeneity  of  economic  agents  in 
macroeconomic  models  is  pointed  out  by  Vines  and  Wills  (2018)  They  also  addresses  the  inability, 
indicated by the several authors, of the DSGE models to produce results that may constitute good advice to 
policy makers in severe economic crisis. Our model does not suffer from this limitation and allows us to 
simulate the long-run impact of fiscal policies through a model that is capable of tracing the transition path 
between steady states, rather than considering stochastic fluctuations around a steady state, as in the case 
of most DSGE models.10 

The  Brazilian  literature  includes  several  studies  that  use  calibrated  DGE  models  to  study  the 
dynamic  macroeconomic  effects  of  fiscal  policy,  and  our  study  is  a  significant  contribution  to  it.  We 
mention  only  a  couple  of  them.  Pereira  and  Ferreira  (2010)  use  an  endogenous  growth  model  with  an 
endogenous  labor  supply  given  by  the  optimization  of  an  additive  utility  function  in  the  logarithm  of 
consumption and leisure, with a relative risk aversion, following Christiano and Eichenbaum (1992). Their 
results confirm that is possible to obtain positive effects on the product derived from a tax reform. Santana 
et.  al.  (2012)  differs  from  this  formulation  by  specifying  government  consumption  as  endogenous, 
specifically, consumer goods made available by the public sector to households. The households’ utility 
function has as an argument an amalgam of public and private goods, and, as in Baier and Glomm (2001), 
there is a parameter that indicates the trade-off between them. However, they do not allow the occurrence 
of deficits nor do they consider the existence of public debt. They simulate an increase in public investment 
and conclude that it is best to reduce current spending. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the specification and methodology 
of the model, and its solution. Section 3 discusses the calibration of model parameters. Section 4 shows the 
results obtained with the application to Brazil in order to simulate the static (in EE) and dynamic effects of 
fiscal  mix changes and fiscal  consolidation  strategies aiming to  reduce the public debt/GDP ratio in  the 
medium term by 10%, followed by a period of consolidation of the gains obtained. The last section brings 
the conclusions and final considerations 

2.  Model Specification 

As indicated in the Introduction, our model is an extension of Papageorgiou (2012) to consider an 
open economy, and two types of households, so several if its characteristics are carried over from it. We 
have justified there also the importance of these extensions, and their role in designing debt stabilization 
programs is shown in section 4. Below we show the mathematical specification of the model, detailing how 
it was modified to include these features.  
Total  population  𝑁𝑡  increases  at  rate  𝛾𝑛,  so  𝑁𝑡+1 = 𝛾𝑛𝑁𝑡,.  There  are  two  types  of  households: 
 
Ricardian  and  non-Ricardian,  and  their  proportions  –  which  is  (1-𝜆)  and  𝜆,  respectively  –  in  the  total 
                                                 
9  This  means  that  marginal  utility  of  wealth  is  a  decreasing  function  of  wealth,  thus  wealthier  agents  choose  to  increase 
consumption of all goods, which includes leisure, and decrease their work effort. This would explain why  poor agents supply 
more labor than wealthier agents, which attenuates the effect of inequality in the capital endowments.

are indexed by ℎ = 𝑅 𝑜𝑟 𝑁𝑅, for the two types, respectively. It is assumed the households have an infinite 
horizon  and  choose  consumption  subject  dynamic  equation  that  drives  the  evolution  of  wealth,  the 
transversality  condition,  and  the  initial  wealth  condition.  Preferences  for  leisure  and  consumption  are

function is temporally separable and additive, and the instantaneous utility 𝑢 at time t is discounted at a rate 
𝜌𝑡,  so  the  discount  factor  is  𝛽𝑡 = 1/(1 + 𝜌) 𝑡.  Instantaneous  utility  is  a  function  of  a  Cobb-Douglas 
aggregation of total consumption and leisure with parameter 𝛾 ∈ (0,1), 12 and is assumed to be a CRRA 
function parameter 𝜎  ≥ 1:13

In  the  dynamic  deterministic  context,  the  intertemporal  substitution  elasticity  is  1/𝜎,  which  and 
 
reflects the households’ willingness to replace consumption today by future consumption. Higher values 
of  𝜎  imply  that  consumers  are  less  willing  to  forego  consumption  in  the  present  in  exchange  for 
consumption  in  the  future,  which  will  affect  the  volatility  of  short-term  consumption  in  the  face  of 
macroeconomic shocks.14 
The decision of the two types of households is different, and we discuss them in turn below. The 
 
decision of the Ricardian households is restricted by the budget constraint, the initial value of wealth and 
the transversality condition. The following equation represents the budget constraint:

for investment in physical capital (𝐼𝑡) and saving for the purchase of government bonds (𝐷𝑡). The right

economy (𝑤𝑡) times a parameter for relative professional qualification (𝜇𝑅), deduced by the ad valorem

The non-Ricardian households are  myopic  and consume all their net  income (this  Campbell  and

11 These proportions were defined considering the evidences found by Gomes (2013).

which is endogenous. It results from the maximization of utility subject to the restrictions above and the 
endowment of hours, which for non-Ricardian households is normalized to be equal to the share λ of the

It  is  assumed  that  the  number  of  firms  is  equal  to  the  number  of  Ricardian  consumers  i.e.  the 
considering they are all equal, the ownership matrix of the firms is an identity matrix. The firms produce a 
homogenous good which serves indistinctly for consumption and investment, whether of the households or 
the government.  They behave competitively, the production function is isoelastic with constant returns to 
scale, and the factors are human capital 𝐻, and the two types of physical capital 

𝑌𝑡 = (𝐾𝑡)𝛼1(𝑍𝑡𝐻𝑡)𝛼2(𝐾𝑔̅̅̅̅𝑡)𝛼3                                                            (5) 

where 𝑍𝑡 is the variable that captures exogenous technological progress16 and 𝐾𝑔̅̅̅̅𝑡 is the average public 
capital per firm (considered as exogenous in the households’ decision) and 𝐾𝑡 is, as indicated before, the 
total private capital. Note that 𝐻𝑡 corresponds to the entire labor supply of the economy, that is, it includes 
both  types  of  families.  The  assumption  of  constant  returns  of  scale  implies  П𝑡 = 0,  and  the  sum  of  the 
output elasticities with respect to private capital(𝛼1), labor (𝛼2) and public capital (𝛼3) is equal to 1. 

There are six instruments of fiscal policy: three tax rates on consumption, income from capital and 
from labor, and three types of public expenditures, public investment, and public consumption, and lump-
sum  transfers  to  households.  We  define  the  model  with  a  distinct  tax  on  income  from  labor  to  each 
household, which will allow us to simulate a debt consolidation strategy that relies only on Ricardians. The 
deficit  is  financed  by  issuing  public  debt.  The  Government  has  access  to  foreign  savings  and  by  issues 
bonds to finance the deficit. These revenues are spent on that increase the household’s income. In this model 
there  is  no  inflation  and,  consequently,  no  inflationary  tax.  The  government's  budget  constraint  is

The  resulting  system  of  equations  can  be  solved  by  calculating  the  Euler  equations  for  the  state

in units of effective labor (denoted by lowercase letters). These are defined from the aggregated variables 
using the formula 𝑥𝑡 = 𝑋𝑡 𝑁𝑡𝑍𝑡
, where 𝑋𝑡 is a generic aggregate variable, except for the number of hours

The  system  of  equations  (11)  to  (20)  is  determined,  to  the  extent  that it has  identical  number  of 
equations and endogenous variables for each period t, as long as their initial values are given. It should be 
noted  that  the  budget  constraints  of  the  government  and  the  Ricardian  households  appear  in  the  system 
(equation  (19)  and  (20),  respectively)  but  the  budget  constraint  which  is  derived  from  non-Ricardian 
households' budget restriction (equation 4) is omitted.  This follows from a corollary of Walras' Law, which 
states that in the equilibrium of an exchange economy with N consumers, if N - 1 of them satisfy the budget 
constraint, the budget for Nth is also satisfied. This result can be generalized to an economy with production 
Government, which is our case. Therefore, the budget constraint of the N-th – in this case, the non-Ricardian 
households – is redundant, and is implied by the equilibrium budget equations of the other agents 

To obtain the long-run steady state (SS) solution, we require the endogenous variables (𝑥)  to be 
stationary: 𝑥𝑡−1 = 𝑥𝑡 = 𝑥𝑡−1 = 𝑥 for all t. The following equation system is obtained for the SS, which is 
used to calibrate the model:

In  the  numerical  solution  of  the  model  (11)  to  (20),  the  general  equilibrium  trajectories  perfect 
forecast  solution  is  obtained  with  the  software  that  allows  the  convenient  algebraic  specification  of  the 
system  of  equations,  and  enables  the  use  of  a  very  efficient  and  precise  routine  for  the  solution  of  the 
resulting non-linear system of equations.17 The model can then be easily simulated for different scenarios 
for the policy variables. 

To assess the impacts on the households’ welfare, Lucas’ (1990) metric is used. It is based on the 
consumption subsidy necessary to keep the households indifferent between the situation before and after 
the change in  fiscal  policy.  Denoting as the intertemporal  utility discounted in  steady state in  the initial 
ℎ  and  𝑉∗ℎ  respectively,  the  permanent  proportional 
situation  and  after  the  changes  in  fiscal  policy  by  𝑉0
consumption subsidy is represented by 𝜉ℎ: 

ℎ⁄
𝜉ℎ = (𝑉∗ℎ 𝑉0

𝛾(1−𝜎) − 1                                                (31) 

when there is a welfare increase, this variable is positive (𝜉ℎ > 0), and is negative when there is a welfare 
reduction (𝜉ℎ < 0).  

3.  Calibration the Model for the Brazilian Economy 

The model was calibrated to the Brazilian economy, and roughly reflects its state of at the end of 
2016. The data comes from several sources, of which the main are: IBGE, especially the National Accounts, 
IPEA, IFI (Instituição Fiscal Independente), and the World Bank. The steady state model (equations (21) 
to (30) was used to calibrate the model for the initial date which we consider to be the end of 2016. Appendix 
A  contains  the  details  of  the  calibration  and  indicates  the  assumptions  made.  Table  1  summarizes  the 
parameters of the calibrated model. 
Following usual practice, we assume the economy is in a (virtual) steady state at the initial date.18 
 
As  proposed  by  Papageorgiou  (2012),  the  share  of  transfers  in  GDP  (𝑔𝑡𝑟 𝑦⁄ )  is  used  as  the  adjustment 
parameter. Its observed value in 2015 was 9.4%, and if that value were to be maintained the ratio (𝑏 𝑦⁄ ) 
would  follow  an  explosive  trajectory  (the  status  quo  path).  For  the  initial  state  of  the  economy  be  a 
stationary equilibrium with that rate equal to the one observed in 2015 (0.66%), the 𝑔𝑡𝑟 𝑦⁄  was adjusted to 
2.9%, which is the value obtained by solving the system of equations (21) to (30) with the other parameters 
of Table 1. This benchmarck steady state is used as a starting point for the simultaions.

Fiscal Policy Simulations 

Following Papageorgiou (2012), two types of policy simulations are performed: fiscal mix changes, 

 
and debt consolidation exercises. 19  
 
The simulations of tax mix changes follows the approach proposed by Cooley and Hansen (1992) 
and involves changing one of the fiscal parameters, and compensating its fiscal impact by changing another 
fiscal  parameter,  keeping  the  other  parameters  fixed  at  their  initial  level.  The  altered  values  of  the  two 
parameters are  maintained throughout the temporal horizon to evaluate if the change improves the present 
value of welfare.  
 
In the debt consolidation exercises, a single instrument is use for each simultation, but its value is 
not maintained fixed throughout the horizon. Rather, during a 10 year adjustment period the instrument is 
set the level required to attain a 10 p.p.  reduction of in the public debt to output ratio at the end of that 
period. After the end of the adjustment period that same instrument is set at the long term value which is 
consistent with the steady state debt level, adjusting the  fiscal policy to satisfy  his intertemporal budget 
constraint in after-reform period. 
 
In the single household version of the model, the impact of these policies on welfare is inequivocal, 
but  in  this  two  household  type  version  of  the  model  it  is  possible  that  a  given  tax  mix  change  or  debt 
consolidation strategy is not Pareto superior, and there will not be aggreement with respect to its adoption. 

                                                 
19 Performing the same type of exercises facilitates the comparison of the results. Tourinho and Brum (2018) show the result of 
these simulations in the Papageorgiou (2012) model calibrated for Brazil. Note however that the correspondence is not exact as 
there are some changes made to the specification of the size of the fiscal changes to make them truly comparable in terms of 
fiscal effort and there are also changes in the result that are a consequence of the numerical solution of the model.

4.1  Long-run Effects of Changes in the Tax Mix 

𝑐, 𝜏𝑡

𝑙ℎ, 𝜏𝑡

 
The set of simulations for combination of different pairs of instruments produces a qualitative map 
of the relative impacts of different tax mix policies. They can be organized by systematically combining the 
𝑘) or expenditure per 
parameters as follows. The initial change of each fiscal parameter, tax rate (𝜏𝑡
unit of efficient work (𝑔𝑐𝑡, 𝑔𝑖𝑡, 𝑔𝑡𝑟𝑡), is calibrated to represent a fiscal effort equal in the magnitude of 1% 
of GDP at the initial date.20 In this simulations we admit that the change in the tax on labor income is the 
same  for  both  households21.  For  each,  the  compensating  changes  in  the  another  fiscal  instrument  are 
calculated as the solution of the system of equations (21) to (30).  
 
The results of seventeen simulations are shown in Table 2, characterized by the values of the main 
macroeconomic aggregates. They are grouped according to the policy being simulated, which is indicated 
in the line "Policy", and each column of the group indicates the results of using as compensation instrument 
the one shown in the line "Compensation". The line "Compensatory Variation" shows the magnitude of the 
compensatory variation in percentage points, in the case of the tax rates, and as relative change with respect 
to the initial value, in the case of transfers (𝑔𝑡𝑟)22. Since the trajectories to the new long-run equilibrium 
are smooth, and most of them are monotonic, the effect on steady state contains all the relevant information 
regarding the effects of these policies.  

Examining the effects on the output (y), the policy that has the largest positive effect (2.02%) is the 
increase  in  government  investment  (𝑔𝑖),  financed  by  a  26.5%  reduction  in  government  transfers  to 
households  (𝑔𝑡𝑟).  However,  such  fiscal  policy  represents  a  welfare  loss  for  non-Ricardian  households, 
since public transfers correspond to a significant portion of their budget. On the other hand, the welfare of 
the Ricardian households is increased by this policy. 

The policy that produces the greatest effect on aggregate consumption is a reduction in tax rate on 
capital income (𝜏𝑘) with an offsetting reduction of government transfers (𝑔𝑡𝑟). It also has a significant 
positive effect on output, which increases 1.69% in the long-run. The increase in consumption (𝑐) is mostly 
due to a large increase in the consumption of Ricardians households (𝑐𝑅). This is also the policy that has 
the greatest effect on capital stock (𝑘), and produces one of the largest marginal product of labour, which 
translates into 1.27% higher wages (𝑤). The long-run impact of this policy in the number of hours worked 
is positive for the non-Ricardians but negative for the Ricardians (ℎ𝑁𝑅, ℎ𝑅).23 
 
For the non-Ricardian households, that receive lower wages and whose budget is more dependent 
on government transfers, any policy that represents a reduction in current income, be it by reducing transfers 
(𝑔𝑡𝑟) or raising the tax rate on labour income (𝜏𝑙), represents a welfare loss. The exception is the policy 
that reduces the tax rate on capital income with an offsetting reduction of government transfers, to which 
they are indifferent. For the Ricardians households any policy that increases the tax rate on private capital 
(𝜏𝑘) significantly reduces welfare, regardless of the compensating variable.  

There are only two policies that increase the welfare of both households, and they use the tax rate 
on consumption (𝜏𝑐) as the offsetting instrument. The one that induces the largest effect on output in the 
new steady state (1.38%) is the increase in public investment (𝑔𝑖). The other policy, which is more desirable 

                                                 
20 Note that there is a crucial difference in relation to the tax mix proposed by Papageorgiou (2012), which follows this rule: i) 
an  1%  reduction  in  the  rate  of  the  chosen  tax,  compensated  by  the  reduction  of  a  government  expenditure  or  an  increase  of 
another rate; or ii) an 1%  increase in any of the expenditures of the Government, in relation to their respective Steady State 
levels, compensated by the increase of one of the aliquots or by the reduction of any other expenditures of the government. It is 
easy to see that the 1% increase has different magnitude when applied to each of the expenditures, just as the magnitude of the 
renounced revenue is different when the 1% reduction in each of the aliquots is applied. This situation can lead to misleading 
results when we compare the different tax mixes. Therefore, we chose to represent the changes in the parameter always with the 
reference of 1% of GDP in relation to the initial Steady State. 
21 That is 𝜏𝑡
22 It is important to note that, despite the high values of variation in the gtr, these values are small when computed as a proportion 
of GDP. The values presented in Table 2 are variations in the total amount of resources allocated for transfers to households. 
23 We can also highlight the contractionary effects of the policies financed by higher distortionary private capital tax rate (𝜏𝑘). 
All simulated cases show that this choice leads to deleterious effects on the output in the long-run.

for both Ricardians and non-Ricardians, reduct the tax rate on capital income (𝜏𝑘) and leads to an output 
1.19% higher in the new steady state.

 Impacts and Long-Run Effects of Fiscal Consolidation Strategies 

 
The  debt  consolidation  policy  is  detailed  as  follows.  The  time  horizon  is  divided  into  two 
subperiods:  the first  is  the adjustment period, in which a contractionary  fiscal  policy is  adopted,  raising 
taxes or reducing expenses, to reach a predetermined public debt target. The duration of the program is 10 
years (t = 0,1, ... ,10) and the target is to reduce the public debt at the end of this period to a level 10% lower 
than  the  initial  level  (𝑏0).  In  the  second  subperiod  (t  =  11,  …,  180),  the  fiscal  parameter  used  for  the 
adjustment assumes another value which is also endogenously calculated. The results of using six different 
𝑘, 𝑔𝑐𝑡, 𝑔𝑖𝑡)  to  perform  this  adjustment  are  considered,  and  Table  3 
fiscal  instruments  (𝜏𝑡
shows both the impact (in t = 1) and the long-run effect (in t = 60) of each debt consolidation strategy.

Among the simulations in which the instrument is the tax on labor income, there is a strategy that imposes 
the same conditions during and after the fiscal consolidation to both Ricardians and non-Ricardians, which 
𝑙  in all periods. The other adjustment focus only on the Ricardians’ income and 
means that 𝜏𝑡
then share the benefit of the fiscal consolidation program – that is, the reduction of the fiscal parameter in 
the second subperiod – between both households. Figure 1 shows the dynamic paths of the main variable. 
First we will discuss the effects of the tax-based debt consolidation policies.

When the debt consolidation is based on the labor income tax rate and affect both households (𝜏𝑙), 
it is necessary to increase it by 1.58 p.p. during the first subperiod. As shown in the first columm of Figure 
1, both households reduce their work effort, especially the Ricardian (ℎ𝑅), which reduce it by 1.4%. Wages 
(𝑤) rise substantially, due to the reduction of labour supply. The impact on consumption is also negative 
for both  households, and the non-Ricardian households  reduce it (𝑐𝑁𝑅) by  1.9%.  The policies based on 
labor income tax rate are the ones that sacrifices economic activity most during the stabilization period. In 
this one, the output (𝑦) falls 0.3% on impact. There is a reduction of 0.67 p.p in the primary deficit-to-
output  ratio  (𝑑 𝑦⁄ ),  leading  to  a  8.2  p.p.  decrease  in  the  public  debt-to-output  ratio  (𝑏 𝑦⁄ )  in  the  first 
subperiod, even after the 0.2 p.p. increase on impact. The reduction of the primary deficit in the adjustment 
subperiod is necessary to achieve the debt target, and the increase in the second is possible mainly because 
of the reduction of interest payments on public debt. In the second subperiod the labor tax rate (𝜏𝑙) is 1.6 
p.p. lower than in the initial period. This unexpected reduction leads to an increase in the consumption of 
both households and in the hours worked. Investment (𝑖) also increases in the long-run, which leads to an 
increase of 0.59% in the private capital stock (𝑘). Thus, in the new steady state the output increases by 
0.56% and the public debt-to-output ratio falls 10.89 p.p..  

On  the  adjustment  based  on  the  labor  income  tax  rate  that  focus  the  consolidation  only  on  the 
Ricardian  households  (𝜏𝑙𝑅),  the  instrument  rises  by  3.01  p.p.  during  the  first  subperiod,  and  the 
unanticipated cut on the tax rate after the consolidation – which is extended to the non-Ricardians – implies 
a reduction on 𝜏𝑙𝑅 and 𝜏𝑙𝑁𝑅 by -1.47 p.p.. This strategy has a long run effect on real economy that is milder 
than the one that rises both 𝜏𝑙𝑅 and 𝜏𝑙𝑁𝑅 during the first subperiod, but spares the non-Ricardians from the 
painful  effects  of  the  fiscal  adjustment  in  the  short  run  since  it  doesn’t  affect  their  labor  effort  and 
marginally increases their consumption during the consolidation. 

In the case which the fiscal stabilization is based on the consumption tax rate (𝜏𝑐) it increases by 
1.18 p.p. during the first subperiod and then reduces it in the second by 1.22 p.p.. As in the previous cases, 
the effects  on the private consumption and hours worked are also  negative, but  quite small.  The capital 
formation increases significantly, drived by the positive impact on investment of the substitution effect in 
the Ricardian households' optimal choice. On impact, output decreases by 0.08%, but in the new steady 
state it increases only by 0.28%. This case displays the mildest long-run effect on output among the tax-
based debt consolidation policies. The effects on the primary deficit-to-output ratio (𝑑 𝑦⁄ ) is very similar 
to that observed in the consolidation based on the labor income tax rate, and the negative effect on public 
debt-to-output ratio (𝑏 𝑦⁄ ) is slightly larger in this case. 

The  consolidation  based  on  the  tax  rate  on  capital  income  (𝜏𝑘)  yields  a  mild  negative  impact 
(0.02%) and the greatest positive long-run effect (1.1%) on output among the tax-based strategies. During 
the  adjustment  sub-period  the  government  increases  the  capital  income  tax  rate  by  2.06  p.p.  and  in  the 
second subperiod it is reduced by about 2.3 p.p. The tax burden in the post-reform subperiod is significantly 
lower than in the initial period, and this explains the significant increase in the private capital formation 
after the adjustment. In this case there is a positive impact on consumption of the Ricardian households, as 
would be expected as a consequence of the reduction in net private capital income. In the new steady state, 
both households have a similar increase in consumption. The primary deficit-to-output ratio falls during the 
years of transition, and rises in the long term, as in the other tax-based strategies. The debt-to-output ratio 
falls by 7.43% in the long run, which is the smallest decrease among the tax-based consolidations. 
The discussion above shows that  the capital  income tax rate (𝜏𝑘) is  the best  instrument for  debt 
 
consolidation of the type considered here. The comparison of the other tax based policies does not show an 
obvious winner, since both instruments affect the consumption-leisure choice. One can note in Figure 1 
that the consolidation based on consumption tax rate (𝜏𝑐) has a quite smaller negative impact on output (𝑦) 
vis-à-vis the consolidations based on labor income tax rate, but it also leads to a lower growth rate in the 
long run. It is also possible to affirm that sharing the cost of adjustment between the two types of households 
(𝜏𝑙) is more advisable than directing this cost only to Ricardians (𝜏𝑙𝑅). The examination of the effect on 
consumption (𝑐) in Figure 1 endorses the following ranking of tax-based instruments: 𝜏𝑘 ≿ 𝜏𝑐 ≿ 𝜏𝑙 ≿ 𝜏𝑙𝑅. 
Comparing the tax-based consolidations in terms of their effect on the return to private capital (𝑟𝑘), we 
observe that the policies based on 𝜏𝑐, 𝜏𝑙 and 𝜏𝑙𝑅 don’t affect 𝑟𝑘 in the long-run, while the adjustment based 
15 

 

on 𝜏𝑘 reduces it by about 1.9%, as expected from equation (14). On the other hand, this last policy increases 
wage (𝑤) by 1%, while the other display an insignificant long-run effect on it. 
The other two fiscal consolidation strategies are based on the government's consumption (𝑔𝑐) and 
 
investment (𝑔𝑖). The variation of their levels in relation to steady state equilibrium in the two sub-periods 
are, respectively, for 𝑔𝑐: -3,35% and + 2.96%; and for 𝑔𝑖: -21,03% and + 22,40%. In this last case the high 
values of the relative variation correspond to small variations relative to the output, since 𝑔𝑖 𝑦⁄ =  3.22% 
in the initial period. Although the impact on primary deficit-to-output ratio (𝑑 𝑦⁄ ) is more significant in the 
case of adjustments in public investment spending, the reduction in the second subperiod is larger when the 
government cuts public consumption spending, as shown in Figure 1. The long term effect on debt (𝑏 𝑦⁄ ) 
is larger when the instrument is 𝑔𝑐, and that is the case where the level of debt-to-output ratio displays the 
largest reduction among all the simulations. 
 
The  effects  on  the  real  economy  of  consolidations  based  on  these  two  instrumens  can  also  be 
compared. The impact of both policies on output are very small, but at the end of the first sub-period the 
cuts in public consumption produces a larger positive effect in the level of output (0.85% in t = 10), as 
shown in Figure 1. When we examine on the long-run effect on output, the public investiment based policy 
produces better results (1.1%) than government consumption based policy (0.37%). However, the effects 
on output (𝑦) of the policy based on 𝑔𝑐 is positive since 𝑡 = 1, while for that based on 𝑔𝑖 this only happens 
after  at  𝑡 = 5.  Also,  while  the  long-run  effect  on  output  (𝑦)  is  already  noticeable  in  𝑡 = 10    when  the 
government consumption is the fiscal instrument, it only exceeds 0.85% in 𝑡 = 37 when the policy is based 
on public investiment. These results suggest that the effects of public investment on the output are greater 
than those of public consumption, but it takes longer to manifest itself, as expected. 
The policy based on 𝑔𝑐 leads to an increase in consumption for non-Ricardian households at the 
 
end  of  the  first  subperiod  of  0.76%,  but  for  the  Ricardian  households  this  rise  is  smaller  (0.39%).  The 
increase in government consumption crowds-out the private consumption in the long-run, and this explains 
the  stagnation  in  the  non-Ricardians’  consumption  and  the  reduction  of  1.08%  in  the  Ricardians’ 
consumption.  Although  these  long-run  results  may  seem  less  desirable  than  those  obtained  when 
government uses public investment to reach the debt target, their impact on consumption in the short-run 
is powerful: if the consolidation is based on  𝑔𝑖, the non-Ricardian households will wait until 𝑡 = 46 to 
reach the consumption level that they would attain in 𝑡 = 10 if the fiscal instrument is  𝑔𝑐. 
 
The analysis of the effects on the households’ welfare also raise some important points. Although it 
is not described in the results shown in Table 2, when we tested the implementation of a fiscal consolidation 
policies in an calibrated scenario that reflects the status quo of the Brazilian economy – where the public 
transfers  are  maintained  at  the  current  level  of  9.4  %  of  GDP  and  the  public  debt-to-GDP  displays  an 
explosive trajectory – we find that debt stabilization is beneficial to the Ricardian agents regardless of the 
chosen strategy. Nevertheless, this is not the case when we compare the welfare in the initial situation of 
stationary  equilibrium  and  after  the  changes  in  fiscal  policy,  as  shown  in  Table  2.  The  adjustment  that 
implies a lower welfare loss for the Ricardian households is the one based only on his labour income tax 
rate (𝜏𝑙𝑅): this policy has an effect that is equivalent to a 0.44% reduction in per capita consumption in 
each year of the dynamic path. Thus, for Ricardian households the preference ordering in the use of fiscal 
instruments would be 𝜏𝑙𝑅 ≿ 𝜏𝑘 ≿ 𝜏𝑐 ≿ 𝜏𝑙   ≿  𝑔𝑐  ≿  𝑔𝑖.  
However, for the non-Ricardian households the welfare effects of these policies is quite different. 
 
As the fiscal adjustment induces more consumption and growth in the long-run, it increases the welfare of 
these households. The stabilization strategy that represents the greatest welfare gain is the one that adjust 
the tax rate on Ricardians’ labor income and spares non-Ricardians during the adjustment but reduces both 
labor  income  tax  rate  in  the  second  subperiod  (𝜏𝑙𝑅).  This  policy  leads  to  the  greatest  increase  in  their 
consumption during the adjust and induces a significant positive effect on it over the post-consolidation 
period. The welfare effect is equivalent to a 0.98% increase in per capita consumption in each year of the 
trajectory. The other five policies have a quite similar effect on the welfare of the non-Ricardians. In sum, 
we could indicate that the policy preference for the non-Ricardian households is: 𝜏𝑙𝑅   ≿ 𝑔𝑐  ≿ 𝜏𝑐 ≿ 𝜏𝑙 ≿ 
𝜏𝑘 ≿ 𝑔𝑖 .

5.  Concluding Remarks 

We examine the macroeconomic implications of fiscal reforms aimed at stimulating the economy 
in the long-run and at consolidating public debt in Brazil. For this we use an extended version of the model 
proposed  by  Papageorgiou  (2012),  which  considers  heterogeneous  households:  Ricardian,  who  have  a 
higher professional  qualification and access  to  the financial market, and the  non-Ricardian, who have  a 
relatively  lower  professional  qualification,  and  therefore  receive  lower  wages  and  behave  like  rule-of-
thumb  consumers  using  their  income  exclusively  for  consumption  since  they  do  not  have  access  to  the 
financial market. We calibrated the model for Brazil in 2015, and used it to simulate the effects of a change 
in the tax mix, where a permanent reduction in one of the fiscal parameters is compensated by a permanent 
increase in one of the others, and debt consolidation policies based on a single instrument.  

The fiscal mix that leads to the most significant expansion of output (𝑦) in the long-run (+ 2.02%) 
is the one that government increases public investment and finances it decreasing permanently the lump-
sum transfers (𝑔𝑡𝑟). The results of these exercises reveal a distributive conflict, since only two policies 
lead to  an increase in  both  households’ welfare: the  reduction in  tax rate  on  capital income  (𝜏𝑘) or the 
increase in public investment (𝑔𝑖), compensated by a permanent increase in tax rate on consumption (𝜏𝑐). 
It is also possible to increase substantially the Ricardians’ welfare and keep the non-Ricardians indifferent, 
by reducting the tax rate on capital income and compensate it through a cut in the lump-sum transfers. 
 
The result of the debt consolidation consolidation exercises, where public debt is reduced by 10% 
over the 10-year adjustment period, reveals that it is possible to increase output between 0.28% and 1.10% 
in the long-run, depending on the instrument used. The consolidation based on the capital income tax rate 
(𝜏𝑘) has the milder negative impact on output (- 0.02%) and the largest long-run effect (+ 1.10%) among 
the  tax-based  strategies.  The  policy  based  on  an  unanticipated  cut  in  public  consumption  (𝑔𝑐)  has  the 
greatest potential to boost output during the consolidation period. None of the adjustments result in welfare 
gains  for  the  Ricardian  households.  The  adjustment  that  implies  a  lower  welfare  loss  for  the  Ricardian 
households is the one based on their labor income tax rate (𝜏𝑙𝑅). This is also the scenario that offers the 
most significant gain for the non-Ricardians households, to whom all simulated strategies increase welfare. 

 
By extending the model to include heterogeneous agents we were able to capture a crucial aspect of 
the Brazilian fiscal problem, which is the lack of political support for fiscal consolidation plans, evidencing 
that this issue stems from the distinct effects of a given fiscal policy on different households characterized 
by income inequality. 
 
that bring further insight in the design of debt consolidation programs. 

Notwithstanding the advances here, there are still remain improvements to be made to the model 

Appendix - Details of the Calibration 

The parameter 𝜎 that indicates the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (1 𝜎⁄ ) is of fundamental 
importance for the determination of the intertemporal choices which define the trajectory of the public debt. 
Lucas (1990) uses 𝜎 = 2 for the US economy, as do Baier and Glomm (2001). Lluch, Powel and Williams 
(1977) estimate an extended linear expenditure (ELES) for several countries, and estimate a value for the 
Frisch parameter for developing countries which implies 1 𝜎⁄ = 0.3 for Brazil. For developing countries, 
Liu and Sercu (2009) estimate 1 𝜎⁄ = 0.5. Papageorgiou (2012) adopted this value for Greece, on the basis 
of its widespread use. Mereb and Zilberman (2013) choose 𝜎 = 3 claiming that the empirical evidence is 
scarce, and Issler and Piqueira (2000) estimate the CRRA utility function using GMM to Brazil, show that 
the estimated value for 1 𝜎⁄  strongly depends periodicity of the data, and estimate (0.62) for quarterly data. 
Considering this evidence, we adopted 𝜎 = 2, i.e. and 1 𝜎⁄ = 0.5.  
The parameter 𝜗 that indicates the rate of substitution between public and private consumption was 
 
set to 0.1, which is approximately the share of public spending on aggregate income.24 Baxter and King 
(1993), Baier and Glomm (2001), Leeper et. al. (2010) and Papageorgiou (2012) all use that same value. 
Some studies in the Brazilian literature, Ferreira and Nascimento (2006), Santana et al. (2012) and Bezerra 

                                                 
24  Excluding  transfers  from  the  public  expenditures,  we  measured  household  consumption  of  public  goods  as  the  sum  of 
“Compensation of Employees” (4.0% of GDP) and “Other Current Expenditure” (5.3% of GDP) in the National Accounts.

et  al.  (2014)  use  𝜗 = 0.5,  a  value  which  appears  to  be  inconsistent  with  the  revealed  preference  of 
households.  
 
The National Accounts (IBGE (2018)) for 2010 to 2016 were used to decompose output according 
to the equation (20). The average value of the aggregates over the period was used, to reduce measurement 
errors and represent more properly an approximate steady state. This does not represent any violence to the 
data, because the expenditure shares were rather stable during that period except for 2016, when the share 
consumption increased 2 p.p. (percentage points) to the detriment of that of public investment. To take this 
into account the value for it observed in 2015 was used: 𝑐 𝑦⁄ = 0,62, and the investment share was set to 
the average of 2010 to 2014: 𝑖 𝑦⁄ = 0.16.25 For the share of consumption of public goods we adopted the 
value observed in 2015: 𝑔𝑐 𝑦⁄ = 0.20. 
We consider that the fraction of non-Ricardian households is equal to λ = 0.67. This value is based 
 
on  the  evidences  found  by  Gomes  (2013)  while  measuring  how  sensible  to  income  is  the  private 
consumption in Brazil. For the population growth rate we used the value in the World Bank's WDI database 
for 2015, so 𝛾𝑛 = 1,0086. Following Papageorgiou (2012) we used the growth rate of per capita GDP in 
the USA (2% per year) for the growth rate of labor augmenting technical progress 𝛾𝑧.26 The initial level of 
the  technical  progress  (𝑍0)  set  to  unit.  The  parameter  of  the  Cobb-Douglas  consumption  aggregator 
function  was  calibrated  to  be  consistent  with  so  the  share  of  hours  devoted  to  work  in  the  total  time 
endowment in the PNAD 2009 survey (IBGE (2018)): 𝛾 = 0.434 since ℎ = 0.24. 
 
Since the production function we assumed displays constant returns of scale, the parameters can be 
calculated from the factor expenditure shares. The average value of the public investment share observed 
between 1995 and 2017 is, according to the IFI (2018), 𝛼3 = (𝑔𝑖 𝑦⁄ ) = 0.0322.27 For the output elasticity 
of labor we follow the methodology in Gollin (2012) and calculate the share of labor income in GDP in 
2015,  28  to  find  𝛼2 = 0.6223,  which  is  consistent  with  Ferreira  and  Nascimento  (2006),  Santana  et.  al. 
(2012)  and  Mereb  and  Zilberman  (2013).  The  output  elasticity  of  private  capital  is  calculated  from  the 
constant  returns to  scale condition,  𝛼1 = 1 − 𝛼2 − 𝛼3 = 0.3455. The depreciation rate of total  physical 
capital  was  set  to  3.5%  per  year,  estimated  by  Gomes  et  al.  (2003)  using  the  permanent  inventory 
methodology on the  investment  series  of the  National  Accounts  and, use the same value for public and 
private capital, 𝛿𝑝 = 𝛿𝑔 = 0.035.29  
 
𝑘 𝑦⁄ = 2.529. Equation (27) yields 𝑘𝑔 𝑦⁄ = 0.503. 30  

The  data  described  previously  was  used  to  calculate  the  initial  steady  state  using  equation  (21): 

We used the tax rates calculated by Santana et al. (2012) for 2010, because they were deemed more 
consisted with a virtual steady state for 2016 than those calculated calculuadted with 2015 data, since the 
latter are distorted by the recent fiscal imbalance. The tax rates are: 𝜏𝑐 = 0,1902; 𝜏𝑙𝑟 = 𝜏𝑙𝑛𝑟 = 0,2171; 
and  𝜏𝑘 = 0,13.  Almeida  et.  al.  (2017)  and  Azevedo  and  Fasolo  (2015a,  2015b)  show  that  they  are 
representative for the period 2010 to 2014, supporting our choice. These values are also consistent with 
those  calculated  by  Bezerra  et.  al.  (2014),  also  for  2010,  since  the  differences  found  can  be  broadly 
attributed to the differences in the specification of their models.  

Equation (22) was then used to calculate 𝛽 = 0.937. 

                                                 
25 The chosen value is very close to that established by Santana et al. (2012), which were based on the average between 1995 
and 2010 and defined as 𝑖 𝑦⁄ = 0,17. 
26 Barbosa Filho et. al. (2010) indicates that between 1992 and 2007 the total factor productivity in Brazil grew only 11.3%, 
with an average rate of 0.71% per year. 
27 Ferreira and Nascimento (2006) and Santana et. al. (2012) use endogenous growth models, and adopt  a higher value for that 
parameter. 
28 It was calculated as (𝑅𝐸 + 𝑅𝑀𝐵) (𝑅𝐸 + 𝑅𝑀𝐵 + 𝐸𝑂𝐵)
⁄
EOB is the Gross Operating Surplus. 
29  Santana  et  al.  (2012)  also  use  this  value.  Some  authors  use  higher  depreciation  rates,  but  they  are  inconsistent  with  the 
investment series. 
30 The value we find is higher than 0.3577, which is the value estimated by Bezerra et al. (2014) using data from IPEA data, but 
is  compatible  with  the  data  the  value  derived  from  IMF  (International  Monetary  Fund)  data  for  2015,    assigning  half  of  the 
private-public partnerships to public capital and the other half to private capital: 0.4494.

The reference for the long-run public debt/GDP ratio we adopted was the one observed in December 
2015 (𝑏 𝑦⁄ = 0.66), before the recent  explosive acceleration of that rate.  This implicitly means that the 
current level of indebtedness (0.77) is unsustainable. 

We used the Fischer relation to exclude inflation from the nominal interest rate on the internal gross 
debt and calculate the real rate of return on public bonds gross of taxes to be 6.88% per year. 31 The net real 
interest rate on public debt is obtained by  deducting from it the average tax rate on this type of income, 
16.5%, obtainting a value of 5.75% per year for 2016.32 Since the analysis here is is prospective, we round 
up this value, and use 𝑟𝑏 = 0.6.  

The parameters that represent relative professional qualification we set 𝜇𝑛𝑟 = 0,5, based on the fact 
that  the  minimum  wage  which  is  an  indication  of  the  productivity  of  the  non-professionally  qualified 
workers which lead the non-Ricardian households is approximately half of the average wage of the private 
sector  in  metropolitan  regions,  according  to  IBGE  data.  Considering  the  proportions  of  each  type  of 
households, the Ricardians’ relative professional qualification is 𝜇𝑟 = 2,02 and which implies that the wage 
of the head of Ricardian families are four times more productive. 

Another dimension along which the two tipes of households differ is their share in the government 
lump-sum  income  transfers,  represented  𝜔ℎ.  It  was  assumed  that  the  the  total  transfers  are  distributed 
evenly among the two types of households. Thus, we find that for 2015 the values 𝜔𝑛𝑟 = 0.67 and 𝜔𝑟 =
0.33. 
 
The parameters and values that represent the very simple foreign sector of our model economy are 
exogenous,  and  were  calibrated  as  follows.  The  external  debt  per  unit  of  labor  was  assumed  to  remain 
constant over time, and calibrated so that net external liabilities are 26% of GDP in 2016.33 The interest 
rate on the external public debt was set to the sum of the average expected Fed funds rate in the US and the 
average  Embi+  Brazil  rate,  so  𝑟𝑓𝑏 = 5%.  The  flow  of  foreign  savings  and  was  also  considered  to  be 
constant over time and set to the average current account deficit between 2010 and 2015 𝑓𝑠𝑎𝑣 𝑦⁄  = 0.033.
