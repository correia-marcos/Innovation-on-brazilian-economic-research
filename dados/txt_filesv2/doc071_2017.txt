Resumo 

Este  trabalho  avalia  o  efeito  da  introdução  da  urna  eletrônica  no  Brasil  sobre  o  gasto  público 
municipal. Primeiramente, um modelo teórico de economia política sugere que, ao facilitar o acesso 
dos pobres ao voto, a urna eletrônica deve ter causado aumento nos gastos sociais dos municípios. 
Essa previsão é testada empiricamente fazendo-se uso como instrumento da introdução gradual da 
urna eletrônica, que afetou o acesso dos pobres, sem afetar diretamente o gasto público. Aplicamos 
duas  metodologias  distintas:  a  regressão  em  dois  estágios  e  a  metodologias  das  diferenças  em 
diferenças.  O  estudo  mostra  evidência  de  aumento  nos  gastos  em  saúde,  educação  e  emprego 
público nos municípios que usaram a urna eletrônica, em comparação com aqueles que não usaram, 
confirmando a previsão do modelo.

Abstract 

This article studies the effect of introducing electronic voting in Brazil on municipal level public 
spending. A theoretic, political economy model suggests that, by de facto enfranchising the poor, 
electronic  voting  increased  social  spending.  This  prediction  is  then  empirically  tested  using  as 
instrument the gradual introduction to electronic voting (EV), which affects voting enfranchisement 
without  directly  influencing  public  spending.  We  apply  two  different  methodologies:  a  2SLS

1- Introduction  

 

The discussion associating voters’ demands to their income has an early tradition. Alexis de 
Tocqueville in his seminal book “Democracy in America” argued that allowing those who do not 
own  property  to  vote  would  increase  the  proportion  of  voters  who  are  in  favor  of  income 
redistribution.  Theoretical  models  also  predict  that  an  increase  in  voting  participation  of  poorer 
voters increases social spending (Meltzer and Richards, 1981). Many empirical works attempt to 
confirm  this  prediction  as  well.1  However,  it  has  remained  a  challenge  to  find  an  identification 
strategy  that  solves  the  reverse  causality  problem  of  regressing  directly  government  spending  on 
voting participation. Namely, the more the government spends, the more likely poor people will be 
to turnout to vote to maintain the status quo.  

This work uses the electronic voting (EV) gradual introduction in Brazil – which increased 
voters’  probability  of  casting  a  valid  vote  without  directly  affecting  social  spending  –  as  an 
instrument to solve the discussed reverse causality. We show that voting enfranchisement biased 
toward poorer voters increase social spending. Our main contributions to the literature are: present a 
theoretical  model;  use  alternative  empirical  strategies;  and  expand  Fujiwara’s  (2015)  analysis  to 
municipalities and to other social spending outcomes.2  

Voting  in  Brazil  is  mandatory,  which  makes  voting  turnout  high,  but  not  necessarily 
guarantees  a  large  percentage  of  valid  votes.  Brazil  has  a  turnout-to-electorate  level  of  80%  on 
average.3  However,  before  EV,  only  58%  of  votes  for  Representatives  were  valid.4  Therefore, 
congressmen could ignore the voice of voters that were not able to cast a vote, which, as argued in 
this work were mostly poor.5 After EV, the valid vote to turnout ratio increased to 92% and the 
main purpose of this work is to associate this de facto enfranchisement to municipal level public 
																																																													
1 See, for instance, Meltzer and Richards (1983); Lindert (2004); Mueller and Stratmann (2003); and Oliveira (2005). 
2 Fujiwara (2015) focused his analysis to Brazilian states and measured the impact of poor citizens’ enfranchisement on 
health spending and health outcomes. 
3	In the United States, for instance, this number is close to 60%. 
4 In the 1994 elections, before EV, the valid vote to turnout ratio for Federal Representatives was only 58%. While in 
2002, when EV was used in all polling stations in the country this number increased to 92% according to the Supreme 
Electoral Court (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral, TSE).

spending, which we find to increase. 

First, we build a theoretical model allowing voters to cast, not purposefully, an invalid vote, 
and  show  that  when  poorer  voters’  likelihood  of  casting  a  valid  vote  increase,  social  spending 
increases  as  well.  Next,  we  propose  a  two  stage  least  square  regression  (2SLS),  using  EV  as 
instrument, to directly test and confirm our model prediction. Finally, we present a differences-in-
differences  (DID)  model,  where  municipalities  using  EV  is  our  treatment  group,  to  expand  our 
sample analysis and bring external validity to our 2SLS estimation.  

The  proposition  that  poor  voters’  enfranchisement  increase  social  spending  has  an  early 
tradition and our empirical model corroborates this finding. Our model considers specificities of the 
Brazilian  elections  to  add  two  assumptions  not  commonly  used  in  the  literature:  voting  is 
mandatory so all voters are necessarily turning out to vote; and voters may incorrectly cast their 
votes.  Interestingly,  as  EV  not  only  decreases  the  number  of  invalid  votes,  but  also  bias  this 
reduction towards the poor (Fujiwara, 2015), the model predicts that the provision of public goods 
should increase because the poor are the ones more likely to demand public goods and at the same 
time, to be de facto enfranchised. 

Besides presenting a theoretical model, this work uses two econometric methodologies to 
test its conclusion. Both explore the fact that, due to a limited supply of voting machines in  the 
1998 federal elections, only municipalities belonging to four selected states and places with more 
than 40,500 voters used EV.6  

First, we estimate a 2SLS regression to measure the impact of poor voters’ enfranchisement 
on government spending at the municipal level during the last two years of the mayor’s four years’ 
term (i.e., 1999 and 2000).7 EV assignment is used as instrument and to guarantee that its usage is 
the only difference between the compared municipalities, the analysis contains only municipalities 
which number of eligible voters is close to 40,500.  

Next,  we  consider  a  larger  sample  and  provide  external  validity  to  our  2SLS  findings  by 
using a DID analysis containing 92% of all municipalities. To use this methodology, we consider 
the four states that had EV in all their territories as the treatment group and the remaining ones as 
the control group. We restrict out sample to municipalities with less than 40,500 voters to avoid 
heterogeneity between the two groups. Then, we compare the differences between the amount of 
public expenditure on the treatment and control groups before EV usage (i.e., last two years of the 
mayoral term that ended in 1996) and after it (i.e., last two years of the mayoral term that ended in 
2000).  

Our two models find similar estimates on the impact of EV on social spending. To preview 
our findings, our 2SLS estimation shows that an increase of 1 p.p. in the valid votes to turnout ratio 
for state representatives increases health spending by 1.65%; public employment by 0.71%; total 
spending by 1%; total revenue by 0.95% and intergovernmental transfers by 1.5%. Our DID model 
estimates  shows  that  an  increase  of  1  p.p.  in  the  valid  vote  to  turnout  ratio  for  Representatives 
increases health spending by 1.42%; public employment by 1.28%; total spending by 1.26%; total 
revenue  by  1.07%  and  intergovernmental  transfer  by  1.11%.  Both  methodologies  present  close 
results,  even  though  the  sample  we  use  is  different,  which  brings  external  validity  to  our  2SLS 
estimation and increase the robustness of our results. 

Besides  the  introduction,  this  work  is  divided  as  follows.  Section  2  presents  a  literature 
review on the connection between voting participation and public spending and discusses the EV 
implementation. Section 3 presents a model that motivates the empirical analysis. Section 4 briefly 
discusses the data collection. Section 5 presents the 2SLS model and Section 6 the differences-in-
differences. Finally, section 7 concludes the work.

7 As we discuss later in further detail, federal elections and municipal elections in Brazil have a two-year gap between 
them. 

2- Background 
2.1. Voters’ enfranchisement and public spending 
 
 
Meltzer  and  Richard  (1981)  show  that  voting  enfranchisement  increases  public  spending. 
Using  a  model  of  electoral  competition,  they  argue  that  the  median  income  voter  is  the  one 
imposing her preferences on public spending. Moreover, the electoral equilibrium shows that the 
poorer  the  median  income  voter  is  the  larger  will  be  her  public  spending  optimum  provision 
demanded. This result comes from the fact that, the poorer the citizen is, the lower will be her tax 
contribution to finance the public provision. Lindert (2004) developed an econometric study using 
decennial data from OECD countries between 1880 and 1930 to confirm the positive relationship 
between government size and vote participation.  In Latin America, Brown and Hunter (1999) study 
the relationship between democracy and public social spending using panel data for 17 countries 
between  1980  and  1992.  The  authors  conclude  that,  especially  in  poor  and  economic  instable 
countries,  democracy  increases  the  allocation  of  public  spending  on  social  programs  when 
compared to dictatorship regimes. 

In the United States, Husted and Kenny (1997) analyze 46 American states between 1950 
and 1988. During this period, restrictions to vote focused mainly on the poor, such as poll taxes 
payments and literacy tests, were banned in the country, thereby increasing voting participation and, 
at  the  same  time,  decreasing  the  income  of  the  median  voter.  Therefore,  it  should  come  as  no 
surprise the result found on their study showing that a reduction of 0.2 on the median voter income 
to the total population income ratio caused an increase of 5 to 12% on public social spending.  
 
Nonetheless,  Meltzer  and  Richard’s  (1981)  argument  is  not  consensual.  Alesina  and 
Giuliano (2009), for instance, argue that the empirical studies are limited and other aspects such as 
the median voter’s perspective on social mobility and strength of lobbying groups could reinforce 
the  limits  imposed  on  government  intervention  in  the  economy.  A  possible  way  to  explain  the 
difficulty  to  find  empirical  evidence  on  the  relationship  between  the  median’s  voter  income  and 
public spending is given by the fact that the median income of the citizen may not be the same as 
the median income of those who show up to vote and cast valid votes. That is, even if democracy 
allows  all  eligible  voters  to  cast  their  votes,  those  who  do  not  vote  may  have  their  preferences 
completely ignored by politicians. Mueller and Stratmann (2003), for example, find that there is a 
positive relationship between turnout and public spending. 
 
Therefore, democracy by itself is not enough to guarantee larger public spending. According 
to UNDP (2005), between 1990 and 2002, less than 55% of all eligible voters living in a democracy 
showed up to cast a vote to a candidate (or party). More importantly, those abstaining to vote are 
more likely to represent the poor (and illiterates). Frey (1971) shows a positive relationship between 
income and electoral participation in the United States. Weeks (2014) finds that “According to U.S. 
Census, 47 percent of eligible adults with family incomes of less than $20,000 a year voted in 2012 
[…] By contrast, those with annual earnings of $100,000 or more turned out at rates of around 80 
percent”. Greene and Nikolaev (1999) using electoral polls between 1972 and 1993 concluded that 
electoral participation monotonically increases with income. Borgonivi et al. (2010) show a positive 
relationship  between  education  and  electoral  participation  in  15  European  countries.  In  Brazil, 
Elkins (2000) finds a positive relationship between political concern and education.  
 
As Bugarin and Portugal (2015) argue, lower political participation concentrated on the poor 
makes  the  median  voter  income  to  be  larger  than  the  median  citizen  income  reducing  the 
preferences  for  public  goods.  A  solution  pointed  by  these  authors  is  to  use  mandatory  voting.8 
Jackman  (2001)  uses  the  Australia  elections  to  show  how  mandatory  voting  increase  voting 
participation (the turnout has increased from 65% to 95% after mandatory voting was imposed in 
this  country).  However,  mandatory  voting  by  itself  cannot  guarantee  voting  participation.  As 
aforementioned, Brazil’s case is illustrative. Although the constitution makes it mandatory for all

literate citizens between 18 and 70 years old to vote,9 in 1994 for instance, less than 60% of those 
who  showed  up  to  vote  (turnout  close  to  80%)  cast  a  valid  vote  for  a  candidate  or  party  to  the 
legislative seats.  

2.2 Electronic voting and political participation in Brazil 
In Brazil, there are elections every other year as Figure 1 shows. For instance, in 1994, the 
federal elections elected the Federal and State Representatives; senators; governors and president. 
Two years later, the municipal elections elected the municipal representatives and mayors.10 EV 
was first implemented in the 1996 municipal level elections. All municipalities with more than 
200,000  eligible  voters  and  the  states’  capitals  used  the  new  technology.11  In  the  1998  federal 
elections all Brazilian municipalities with more than 40,500 eligible voters12 used the electronic 
voting  system.  Finally,  in  the  municipal  elections  of  2000  and  all  the  following  ones  every 
Brazilian voter could electronically vote.  

As  showed  in  the  literature  (Hidalgo,  2010;  Moraes,  2012;  Fujiwara,  2015),  EV  usage  is 
responsible for an increase of 20 p.p. and 14 p.p. in the valid votes (correctly cast votes) to turnout 
ratio for federal and state representatives respectively. To cast a vote for Representative before EV, 
one  should  clearly  write  the  name  or  number  of  the  candidate  in  the  ballot.  Therefore,  it  was 
essential to know how to read to understand the ballot instructions and vote in Brazil.  

The EV introduction made it easier for voters to cast a ballot. In the new system, the voter 
needs to press the candidate’s number on a numerical keyboard13 and after verifying the picture of 
the  candidate,  press  a  green  button  to  confirm  the  vote.14  The  only  way  to  cast  an  invalid  vote, 
accidentally, is to type a candidate’s number with no correspondence and press the green button 
after seeing the screen warning “this number is wrong”.  15 As Hidalgo (2010) points out, the EV 
was considered a democratic progress since even illiterates could press a number followed by the 
green button after seeing their preferred candidates’ face on the screen. 

The main four works on EV in Brazil are Hidalgo (2010), Moraes (2012), Fujiwara (2015) 
and  Schneider  (2016).  All  these  works  converge  to  the  fact  that  EV  has  increased  political 
participation.16 The last three works also show, although in different ways, that EV had a larger 
impact  on  enfranchisement  in  municipalities  with  a  larger  rate  of  illiteracy.17  Hidalgo  (2010), 
focusing on federal representatives’ elections, shows that the party ideological choice (from left to 
right)  suffered  only  a  small  effect  due  to  EV  that  benefitted  the  right  wing  parties  the  most. 
Schneider (2016) showed that places where clientelism have stronger ties in Brazil had a decrease 
in turnout due to EV, which benefitted left-wing parties because clientelism is strongly related to 
right-wing parties. Therefore, disenfranchisement helped the former parties. Moraes (2012) studies 
the  increase  in  electoral  competition  resulted  by  EV  usage  and  Fujiwara  (2015)  focuses  on  the 
public health spending at the state level in Brazil showing that the larger the percentage of voters 
using EV within a state, the larger the amount of health spending and consequently the better the 
																																																													
9 All Brazilian citizens, age 16 and older have the right to vote. Illiterate citizens are not mandated to vote. 
10 Both municipal and federal elections grant a four years term to the ones elected (except senator that get an 8 year 
term). In addition, a two years distance separates these two elections. 
11 Only 57 municipalities used EV in 1996. 
12  Four  states  used  EV  in  all  their  territories  independent  of  the  number  of  eligible  voters  (Rio  de  Janeiro,  Amapá, 
Alagoas and Roraima).  
13  Similar  to  a  regular  phone  keypad  commonly  used  in  Brazil  at  the  time  according  to  Hidalgo  (2010).  Note  that 
Brazilians are intensive users of cellular phones; by the end of November 2016 there were 248.4 million active cellular 
lines in Brazil, which corresponds to 1.2 cellular phone line per citizen in Brazil (http://www.teleco.com.br/ncel.asp). 
14 Fujiwara (2015) shows illustrations of the old ballot comparing it to the electronic one. It is also important to notice 
that the government had made TV advertisement teaching how to vote in the new system and trained people to help 
voters if something went wrong during the voting process in the Election Day. 
15 The voter could not cast a vote on purpose by pressing a white button (blank vote) followed by the green one to 
confirm it.

17 Schneider (2016) also shows that EV had a larger impact on enfranchisement in municipalities with lower GDP per 
capita. 

health outcomes in these places.  

This  article  brings  new  results  and  intuition  on  how  enfranchisement  affects  public 
spending. Differently from Fujiwara (2015), our work relies on municipal level data and shows that 
not  only  health,  but  also  public  employment,  education  and  the  overall  municipalities’  public 
expenditures increase due to EV usage.18 Also, this work shows that the municipal revenue, mostly 
composed  by  federal  and  state  transfers,  of  places  that  used  EV  in  1998  disproportionately 
increased explaining how these municipalities could spend more on public goods.  
3 – The effect of electronic vote on the electoral outcome: A political economy 
model 
3.1 Foundations 
 
 
Section  3  builds  a  voting  model  aimed  at  better  understanding  the  effect  of  EV  on  the 
electoral equilibrium. The model distinguishes to different stages of voters’ decision; first, a voter 
decides whether to vote. Next, if the voter decides to vote, then she will decide to which party to 
vote for. 
A voter’s decision to vote is one of the most discussed issues both in Political Sciences and 
 
in Economics as well. Indeed, considering that there is a cost associated to voting, a rational agent 
will choose to vote only if she believes it is reasonably likely that her vote will change the electoral 
outcome.  Chamberlain  and  Rothschild  (1981)  prove  that  under  rather  general  conditions,  the 
probability that a voter will cast the decisive vote in an election between two alternatives (parties) 
in which there are 2N+1 voters is of order N-1. Therefore, in large elections the probability of a 
voter  being  pivotal  is  negligible.19  But  then,  electoral  participation  should  be  reduced,  as  also 
suggested in Downs (1957, p. 260-276). 
 
However, actual electoral data show a much higher level of electoral participation, even in 
countries where voting is not mandatory. For instance, the 2012 US presidential elections showed a 
record low participation level of 57.4%, which is much higher than social choice theories would 
predict.  
 
Both experimental and theoretic studies aim at understanding why people vote. Blais and 
Young (1999) conclude that a feeling of civic duty is a strong factor that makes people vote, based 
on an experiment conducted by the Canadian Electoral Commission. Schram and Winden (1991) 
present  a  theoretic  model  that  also  assumes  the  civic  duty  motive  but  adds  the  issue  of  group 
identification and the fact that the larger the number of votes a group obtains, the more it is able to 
affect public policy as well; it concludes that members of a group will pressure the other members 
to vote. This second theoretic motive for voting is supported by Schram and Sonnemans’ (1996) 
experimental study. Edlin, Gelman and Kaplan (2007) present a model in which a citizen’s utility 
has a social component, i.e., she cares about the other citizens’ welfare; the model shows that there 
will  be  higher  voting  participation  than  when  a  citizen  has  the  typical  selfish  utility.  Harder  and 
Kronick (2008) stresses that the social environment and the difficulties a citizen faces to vote (due 
to lack of literacy, for example) affect the willingness to vote. Finally, Feddersen and Sandroni’s 
(2006) model assumes that citizens care about the aggregate social cost of voting and introduces the 
concept  of  “ethical  rules”  that  determine  which  citizens  will  vote  in  equilibrium;  the  model 
endogenizes  a  concept  similar  to  the  exogenous  concept  of  civic  duty  as  part  of  the  equilibrium 
solution. 
 

motives for voting described above. In our model each citizen 𝑖 has a willingness to vote	𝜈$∈𝑉⊂
ℝ). The willingness 𝜈$≥0 represents the utility gain agent 𝑖 receives when she votes, regardless of 

In  the  present  paper  we  use  the  concept  of  “willingness  to  vote”  as  a  proxy  for  all  the 

the final result of the election. Note that, since the citizen understands that her vote is insignificant, 
her decision on whether or not to vote depends on the comparison between the cost of voting and

by lightning” (in Carey, 2008). 

her willingness to vote. If the cost is lower than the willingness to vote, the agent will then decide to 
participate and will vote sincerely, for the party that better represents her preferences. 
 
Hence,  our  electoral  analysis  will  be  divided  in  two  steps.  In  the  first  step,  each  citizen 
decides whether to vote, based on her cost to vote and on her willingness to vote. In the second step, 
those who decided to vote cast their ballots. 
 
3.2. First step: The decision to vote 
Primitives of the model 
 

There is a continuum of agents of mass 1, 𝑊= 0,1 . Each agent 𝑖∈𝑊 has a type 𝜈$∈𝑉⊂
ℝ)  –  her  willingness  to  vote.  In  particular,  if 𝜈$=0,  then  agent 𝑖  sees  no  value  in  voting.  The 
willingness to vote 𝜈$ is a continuous random variable distributed in a non-negative set 𝑉 according 
to the distribution 𝐹𝜈$.  
If  she  decides  to  vote,  citizen 𝑖  will  incur  a  cost	𝜅$∈ℝ).  The  cost  reflects  a  number  of 
An agent of type 𝜈$ and cost 𝜅$ will decide to vote if and only if:

components.  Directly,  it  reflects  the  displacement  costs,  the  opportunity  cost  of  time,  etc.  Most 
importantly, it reflects the cost of gathering the information she needs in order to decide who to 
vote for, as well as preparing for filling properly the complex voting cell. This is the component that 
will matter in the present model as it may change according to the voting technology (discussed 
previously). 
General electoral participation 
 

Let 𝐸= 𝑖∈𝑊|	𝜈$−𝜅$≥0   be  the  set  of  voting  citizens.  Then  the  cardinality  of 𝐸,  𝐸 , 

corresponds  to  the  proportion  of  voting  citizens.  Note  that  the  higher  the  expected  value  of  the 
willingness to vote, the higher the overall electoral participation, ceteris paribus. More importantly 
for the present study, the lower the voting costs, the higher the proportion of voting citizens, ceteris 
paribus.  
 
An illustration of the voting costs associated to legal requirements can be found in Brazilian 
institutions. Before the 1988 Brazilian Constitution voters were required to be literate in order to 
vote; therefore, an illiterate citizen would have to first learn how to read and write in order to have 
access  to  voting.  Similarly,  before  the  1960s  several  American  States  required  citizens  to  pass 
literacy tests in order to vote; that, in practice, reduced the vote of the black citizens for whom these 
tests were typically difficult (Husted and Kenny, 1997). 
These  examples  suggest  that  poorer  citizens  tend  to  have  lower  electoral  participation. 
 
Indeed, several empirical studies suggest that this is the case, as reviewed in Bugarin and Portugal 
(2015). In what follows we include such a friction in the original model.

to vote is distributed in each class according to the same distribution function 𝐹𝜈$ . Furthermore, 
i.e.,  𝜅$=𝜅@ for every citizen 𝑖 class 𝐽,𝐽=𝑃,𝑀,𝑅. Finally, as discussed before, suppose that the 
cost of voting is higher for the low-income class, i.e., 𝜅7>𝜅8,𝜅9.  
Therefore, 𝐹𝜅@  corresponds to the percentage of citizens from class 𝐽=𝑃,𝑀,𝑅 that gives 
up voting. Hence, 𝛼′@= 1−𝐹𝜅@ 𝛼@ is the percentage of citizens that belong to class 𝐽 and vote,

Our model allows us to investigate the effect of EV on each income class. Suppose that class 
P, besides being the poorer class, is also the class with lowest literacy levels, so that, it is also the 
class with highest voting costs with the older voting technology, because it requires memorizing 
and  writing  down  the  candidates’  names,  as  discussed  earlier.  Then,  the  percentage  of  electoral 

participation will be lower in class P 𝜅7>𝜅8,𝜅9→1−𝐹𝜅7 <1−𝐹𝜅8,1−𝐹𝜅9

citizens better able to read and write and with higher education levels, the effect of EV will be less 
significant. Hence, for simplicity we assume that EV does not affect the voting costs for the other 
two  classes.  Therefore,  EV  will  allow  higher  participation  rates  for  the  poor  class  without 
significantly changing the participation rates in the remaining classes. 
 
The basic ideas of the model 
The electoral competition model presented here follows Bugarin and Portugal (2015). Two 
 
parties simultaneously announce political platforms. A platform consists of a provision of a public 
good that will be produced if the party wins the election. Production of the public good is totally 
funded by taxes to be collected from every citizen according to a single tax rate. Since society is 
composed of three income classes, all citizens from the same class will have the same preferences 
for public good provision. Furthermore, since all citizens benefit the same way from public good 
consumption  but  the  poorer  ones  pay  fewer  taxes  for  its  production,  typically  the  poorer  classes 
prefer more public goods than the rich ones.  
 
A percentage of citizens in each class does not vote. Those who vote will vote sincerely, for 
the party that better represents his preferences. Citizens’ preferences take into consideration parties’ 
platforms  but  are  also  influenced  by  unpredicted  stochastic  factors  that  are  orthogonal  to  the 
announced  platforms.  Examples  of  such  factors  are  sexual  scandals  or  a  terrorist  attack,  among 
others.  
 
Elections are held in one national electoral district in which each voter has one vote. After 
the elections, each party is assigned a quantity of seats in the Legislature that corresponds to the 
percentage of votes it received. After the new Legislature is formed, the party that has a majority of 
seats (we assume an odd number of seats) implements its campaign platform: taxes are collected 
and the public good is provided. Figure 2 presents the general form of the game. Note that only the 
first and the third boxes correspond to agents’ decisions. Furthermore, decisions in the third box are 
straightforward since voting citizens vote sincerely. The details of the electoral competition game 
and its solution are presented next.

A voter’s utility has two components: a pragmatic component and an ideological one. This is 
the most general way of characterizing an economic agent who also has political concerns; for more 
on this topic, see Ferejohn (1986), Bugarin (1999) and Bugarin (2003). The pragmatic or economic 
part  of  the  utility  represents  the  voter’s  decisions  as  a  homo  œconomicus  and  depends  on  the 
consumption of a private good, as well as the consumption of the public good. Thus, if a citizen of

is  a  twice  differentiable,  strictly  increasing,  and  strictly  concave  function.  In  the  present  model 
public good provision and the corresponding income tax rate are the result of the electoral process; 

class 𝐽 has private consumption 𝑐@ and public good consumption 𝑔, its utility is 𝑐@+𝐻𝑔  where 𝐻 
therefore, the homo œconomicus will choose the highest possible private consumption, i.e.,  𝑐@=
1−𝜏𝑦@, and the resulting pragmatic component of his utility is: 
1−𝜏𝑦@+𝐻𝑔 .       (3) 
Hence, we can write that agent’s pragmatic utility as 𝑊@𝑔 = 𝑦−𝑔 NON+𝐻𝑔. Therefore, 
her preferred public policy is:  𝑔∗@= 𝐻′ QR NON ,𝐽=𝑃,𝑀,𝑅.             (4) 
Note that 𝑔∗7>𝑔∗8>𝑔∗9, i.e., the poorer a citizen is, the more favorable she is to public 

 
expenditure, as discussed before. This result is well known in the literature and has been carefully 
formalized  in  Meltzer  and  Richard  (1981).  It  explains  the  increase  in  the  size  of  governments 
throughout  the  19th  and  20th  centuries  as  a  consequence  of  the  expansion  of  suffrage  in  the 
consolidating western democracies. 
The  ideological  component  of  a  voter’s  utility  function  reflects  her  concerns  as  a  homo 
 
politicus and depends on two random variables corresponding to the voter’s bias towards party B, or 
equivalently,  party  B’s  popularity  at  the  time  the  election  is  held.21  The  first  random  variable  is 
common  to  all  voters  and  relates  to  the  realization  of  a  state  of  nature  that  affects  the  entire 
population. A war, an abrupt change in international oil prices and a countrywide energy crisis are 
examples  of  such  phenomena.  A  clear  example  is  the  popularity  of  the  U.S.  president  after  the 
terrorist  attack  on  September  11th,  2001,  which  increased  from  57%  in  February  to  90%  in 

The parameter y>0 measures the level of society’s sensibility to these shocks: the lower the value 
of y,  the  more  those  shocks  may  affect  society.  To  illustrate,  price  changes  in  oil  may  strongly 
affect  the  political  equilibrium  in  a  country  that  depends  strongly  on  that  product,  such  as 
Venezuela, and have much less effect in countries that produce near their internal demand levels, 
such as Brazil.

In other words, the new voting technology brings about a reduction in the cost of voting to 
the poor, which increases their participation and, thereby, increases the weight of their preferences 
in parties’ calculations, thereby increasing the equilibrium provision of public goods. 
 
This is the main conclusion of the present theoretic model. The main theoretic insight is that 
increasing  de  jure  access  to  voting,  by  legally  extending  the  suffrage  to  poorer  citizens,  is  not 
enough to ensure that the political parties will take these citizens’ preferences into account. It is 
necessary that, in addition to having the right to vote, these citizens really exert that right. Only in 
the case where poorer citizens do participate strongly in the political arena by voting, will public 
policy reflect their preferences. 
The main point of the present work is that, due to the high cost of voting to poorer, illiterate 
 
citizens  in  Brazil,  their  preferences  were  not  fully  considered  until  EV  technology  strongly 
increased their participation, changing the electoral equilibrium. 
 
The empirical implication of the model and its testable hypotheses are straightforward: if the 
model does rightfully reflect the real situation, then, we should have observed a significant increase 
in the provision of public goods in Brazil after the implementation of EV. More specifically, since 
poorer citizens care more about social policy (health, education, cash transfers, etc.) we should have 
observed a clear increase in public spending in these areas. 
 
The  following  sections  test  these  hypotheses  confirming  that  there  was  indeed  a  robust 
increase in social expenditure in Brazil after the advent of EV and that this increase is particularly 
strong in municipalities with higher numbers of illiterate citizens. 
4- Data 
 
We  use  publicly  available  data  on  local  government  spending  focusing  social  expenses 
related to health and education services, and public employment.23 We also look at total budget, 
total  expenses  and  receipt  of  intergovernmental  transfers.  Total  budget  and  expenses  shows  the 
overall increase in social spending in response to enfranchisement. Intergovernmental transfers are 
selected  because  the  Federal  and  State  Representatives  have  connections  with  municipalities  and 
disproportionately benefit the ones that are more likely to vote for them by sending these transfers 
(see  Ferreira  &  Bugarin,  2007,  Brollo  &  Nannicini,  2012  and  Bugarin  &  Marciniuk,  2017  for  a 
discussion on politically motivated transfers in Brazil).	In addition, as discussed in Novaes (2015), 
mayors act as brokers for Representatives campaigning for them in exchange for financial support. 
Therefore,  Representatives  would  be  interested  in  transferring  money  to  the  municipalities  with 
more valid votes to turnout ratio (positively related to EV usage), since the mayor will be able to 
deliver a larger number of votes in exchange for these transfers.  

EV was first implemented in a federal election, however, we examine municipal level data. 
Therefore, we use the previous literature (Brollo and Nannicini 2012; Novaes 2015) to support our 
assumption  that  mayors  respond  to  this  election.  To  capture  this  mayoral  behavior,  we  use  the 
average spending in the two years following the federal elections and that are also the two years 
preceding the municipal ones. For instance, the 1998 federal elections’ impact is measured by the

average of the municipal public spending between 1999 and 2000. Places that used EV in 1998, and 
that therefore have extra political participation biased toward the poor, are expected to spend more 
on public goods provision between 1999 and 2000.  

following one: 

In addition to the dummy used to identify EV usage, we control for several confounding 
factors. Usage of EV is identified by the municipalities’ total registered electorate in 1996.24 The 
control  variable  are  composed  by:  the  percentage  of  votes  for  the  incumbent  mayor  in  the  1996 
municipal  elections;  a  dummy  showing  if  the  mayor’s  party  is  the  same  as  the  president  or 
governor’s  coalitions  at  the  time  (for  each  respective  state);  the  number  of  eligible  voters;  the 
average household monthly income per capita; the percentage of people living in rural areas; and 
the  illiteracy  rate.25  Lastly,  we  use  a  municipality  ideological  index,  which  ranges  from  0  to  10 
(where 0 is extreme left wing and 10 extreme right wing), that can potentially explain differences in 
municipal level spending.26

The  natural  regression  to  test  the  theoretical  model  presented  in  Section  3,  would  be  the 

where 𝑙𝑛	𝑌x	is  the  logarithm  of  the  average  social  spending  between  1999  and  2000  in

the control variables and 𝜖x	is the error term.  
may  be  correlated  to  past  social  spending  which  in  turn  increased	𝑉x.  For  instance,  suppose  the 
overestimated	𝛽R. Secondly, omitted variables such as the measurement of the median voter income 

spending in education between 1999 and 2000 is correlated to the spending in education in the past 
10 years. If this is true, then previous spending on education would benefit the poor by giving them 
access to schooling and help them to be enfranchised as they could cast a vote. The estimated return 
to  enfranchisement  would  then  be  biased  due  to  this  reverse  causality  –  bringing  an 

Two problems may arise with this model. First, the social spending between 1999 and 2000 

may also bias the results. Valid votes by itself may not show poor voter enfranchisement. It could 
be the case that the municipality has a large valid vote to turnout ratio because most citizens are rich 
and can therefore cast a vote. This could underestimate our results since large number of valid votes 
would show smaller preferences for redistribution. 

 

 To solve these problems, we estimate the following 2SLS model: 

𝑉x=𝜇+𝜋R𝐷x+𝜋T𝑋x+𝑢x                 (16) 
𝑙𝑛	𝑌x=𝛿+λ𝑉x+Λ𝑋x+𝜀x                  (17) 

 

where 𝐷x		is  a  dummy  variable  indicating  if  municipality 𝑚  used  EV.  The  difference  between 
equations (15) and (17) is that λ measures the impact of the estimated valid votes to turnout ratio 

captured by equation (16). Therefore, the instrumented valid votes to turnout ratio in equation (17) 
impacts social spending only through the enfranchisement brought by EV that is biased toward the 
poor voters. Since the number of eligible voters is related to EV usage, there are no controls for 
number  of  voters.  To  compensate  for  this  fact,  the  regressions  are  restrained  to  a  small  interval 
close  to  the  cutoff  for  EV  usage  (40,500  voters)  so  the  municipalities  can  be  comparable.27  The

made available by Ipeadata, and are based on the decennial data collected in 1991 and 2000. Therefore, 1991 and 2000 
has become a proxy for 1994 and 1998 respectively. 
26 The construction of this index can be found at Schneider (2016). 
27  Note  that  municipalities  belonging  to  the  four  states  mentioned  earlier  (Rio  de  Janeiro,  Amapá,  Roraima  and 
Alagoas), used EV even if they had less 40,500 voters. 

results are presented next. 

5.2 Results 
Table  1  shows  the  estimations  for  a  closed  interval  of  municipalities  containing  between 
35,500 and 45,500 voters.28 An increase of 1 p.p. in the valid votes to turnout ratio increases health 
spending by 1.65%; public employment by 0.71%; total spending by 1%; total revenue by 0.95% 
and intergovernmental transfer by 1.5%. Although the municipalities are likely to be similar, one 
can  still  argue  that  the  results  are  driven  by  the  lack  of  control  for  population.  However,  we 
performed  a  robustness  check  that  shows  how  replicating  our  2SLS  analysis,  but  using  the 
municipal  social  spending  variables  after  the  1994  (no  EV)  and  2002  (only  EV)  elections  as 
dependent variables shows no significant results. Details are available upon request. 

The  2SLS  estimates  presented  above  empirically  confirms  the  prediction  of  the  model 
presented  in  section  3.  However,  it  has  some  limitations.  First,  it  has  a  small  sample.  Second, 
although the difference between the number of eligible voters is small across municipalities close to 
the cutoff, the regressions do not control for it due to the high correlation between the number of 
eligible  voters  and  the  instrument  EV  usage  (correlation  close  to  .70  for  the  5,000  bandwidth 
considered). The differences-in-differences methodology is used next to check the robustness of the 
results by introducing a larger sample analysis.

6.1 Estimation Strategy 
 
An  alternative  way  to  test  our  hypothesis  is  to  use  the  differences-in-difference  (DID) 
methodology.  As  mentioned  before,  this  method  compares  municipalities  that  used  EV  (the 
treatment  group)  to  the  ones  that  did  not  (the  control  group).  It  then  presents  the  differences  in 
public spending between two periods, before and after the EV usage, within these two groups as the 
following regression shows: 

where 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟(cid:131) is a dummy variable equal to 1 when 𝑡=1998	and 𝐸𝑉$ is a dummy variable equal to 
group has.29 The vector 𝑋$(cid:131) includes all control variables that vary across time and municipalities 
(such as average income and number of eligible voters). The dependent variable 𝑦$(cid:131) corresponds to 
the  per  capita  social  public  spending  (such  as  health  and  education)  and 𝜖$(cid:131)  represents  the  error 
term.  The  coefficient 𝛽R	is  the  parameter  of  interest  that  captures  the  effect  of  EV  on  municipal 

1  for  municipalities  that  have  used  EV.  For  this  estimation,  we  restrict  the  EV  usage  to  the 
municipalities  with  less  than  40,500  eligible  voters  and  that  belonged  to  the  four  states  that  had 
electronic  voting  is  all  its  territory.  Therefore,  we  can  have  a  sample  that  covers  most  Brazilian 
municipalities and that at the same time have on average the same number of voters than the control 

public spending. 
The  following  assumptions  are  made  about  the  estimations.  First,  as  the  EV  was 
	
implemented partly in the 1998 federal elections, we assume that the local administrations observe 
the change in the political participation for these elections and answer to it based on the median 
voter’s choice. Second, we assume that non-observed variables that vary across time are orthogonal 
to  the  variable  of  interest.30  Third,  the  selection  of  the  four  states  which  used  EV  in  all  their 
territories  was  not  driven  by  political  interests.  As  Fujiwara  (2015)  argue,  there  are  no  political 
motivation behind the EV usage selection.31 Fourth, the control and treatment group do not present 

																																																													
28 Increasing the interval to a bandwidth of 15,000 voters increases the significances of the results. 
29 If we were to consider all municipalities that used EV in 1998, our treatment group would have municipalities where 
the number of eligible voters will vary from 947 to 7,131,342. On the other hand, the control group will have less than 
40,500 eligible voters in all its municipalities. 
30 See Angrist and Krueger (1999) for a complete discussion on the DID methodology. 
31	 Fujiwara  (2015)  explain  the  four  states  selection  as  follows:  “Two  remote  states  largely  covered  by  the  Amazon 
forest (Amapá and Roraima) were chosen to check the electoral authority’s ability to distribute EV in isolated areas, 

significant differences due to the EV usage on variables that are not likely to be affected by it. Table 
2 presents a balance check to support the argument. 

Table 2 shows that EV impacted valid votes and voting turnout. EV increased valid votes to 
turnout ratio for federal and state representatives by 22 and 14 p.p. respectively. This result is close 
to  the  ones  reported  in  the  literature  (Fujiwara  2015,  Hidalgo  2010).  EV  did  also  decrease  the 
turnout to electorate ratio by 6.8 p.p. This finding was previously reported by Schneider (2016) and 
we show later that it is not threatening our results.32 Before testing whether EV usage affects public 
spending, Figure 3 (below) motivates the DID methodology we use. 

Figure 3 shows that the average social spending (all variables considered) between 1999 and 
2000 (year of the municipal election) disproportionately increased on municipalities using EV in 
1998. It is noteworthy that the social spending before 1998 (for most variables with exception of 
health and public employment) was disproportionately larger on municipalities that did not use EV 
making stronger the argument that EV has changed the municipal social spending. In 2004, there is 
a clear pattern in public spending that is similar for both groups, which can be explained by the 
leveling  on  political  participation  in  all  municipalities  brought  by  the  general  usage  of  EV  since 
2000. 
 

6.2 Results 
The  DID  estimation  results  are  presented  in  Table  3.  Columns  (1),  (2)  and  (3)  show 
respectively, the results obtained for social spending on health, education and public employment. 
Columns (4) and (5) consider, respectively, municipal total spending and budget. Finally, Column 
(6)  shows  the  intergovernmental  transfers,  both  national  and  subnational  (state),  received  by 
municipalities. EV usage increases total spending on health, education and public employment by 
21, 14.5 and 18.5 percent respectively.33 EV caused total spending, revenue and intergovernmental 
transfers to increase by 17.7, 15 and 15.5 percent respectively.  

The intergovernmental transfers variable helps to explain how municipalities can get more 
revenue to spend on social expenditures. As Brollo and Nannicini (2012) argue, these transfers are 
extremely relevant since it accounts, on average, for 65% of the municipal budget. However, parts 
of  these  transfers  are  constitutional  automatic  transfers  such  as  the  Fundo  de  Participação  dos 
Municípios (FPM), main source of revenue for small municipalities.34 Therefore, we control for the 
FPM  in  our  Table  3  estimates.  Using  FPM  as  control  made  our  estimates  larger  in  magnitudes, 
showing evidence that not taking this transfer into account downward bias the results. 

Table  3  results  are  close  to  the  ones  presented  on  Table  1.  An  interesting  exercise  we 
propose  is  to  consider  Table  2  estimations,  showing  an  increase  of  14  p.p.  in  the  valid  votes  to 
turnout  ratio  for  State  Representatives,  and  plug  this  value  on  Table  1.  This  gives  the  following 
result: An increase of 14 p.p. in the valid votes to turnout ratio increases health spending by 23.1%; 
public  employment  by  10%; 
total  revenue  by  13.3%  and 
intergovernmental transfer by 20.3%. This exercise shows that both Tables 1 and 3 present a similar 
estimation  of  the  response  of  public  spending  to  political  participation,  even  though  they  use 
different data. This provides external validity to our 2SLS estimations, increasing the robustness of 
our results.  

total  spending  by  13.9%; 

Finally,  we  address  the  problem  of  lower  turnout  caused  by  EV  as  presented  in  Table  2. 
Schneider  (2016)  argues  that  EV  caused  lower  turnout  specially  on  places  where  clientelism  is 

																																																																																																																																																																																																										
while the states of Rio de Janeiro and Alagoas had areas where the army provided security to election officials, allowing 
an opportunity to check the logistics of distributing the electronic devices jointly with the military” (p.431).	
32 This should be a concern to our measurement because the turnout was reduced especially in places where clientelism 
is stronger (Schneider 2016), which are poorer municipalities. Therefore, our estimations could be underestimated as 
the impact of EV on social spending would be even larger had those poorer voters participated in the election. This will 
be further discussed in this section. 
33 A 21% increase on health spending, for instance, would be equivalent to an increase of 24.75R$ (or 12$) per capita. 
34 According to IBGE (the Brazilian institute of geography and statistics), municipalities with less than 5,000 citizens, 
between 1998 and 2000, got on average 57.3% of their revenue from FPM. 

strong, which are largely composed by poorer municipalities. To test if this is also the case for our 
restricted sample, we measure whether turnout had a larger decrease on places with below median 
income.  

Table 4 indicates that EV only affected voting turnout of poorer municipalities. As column 1 
shows, there was no change in turnout in municipalities with above-median income. However, these 
places had a large increase in enfranchisement (close to 20 p.p. increase in valid votes to turnout 
ratio). Places with below median income had a large decrease in turnout caused by EV (close to 12 
p.p.), together with an increase in valid votes to turnout ratio (25 p.p.).   

Schneider’s  (2016)  argument  holds  in  our  restricted  sample  and  allow  us  to  isolate  the 
impact  of  enfranchisement  on  social  spending  if  we  consider  only  the  above  median  income 
municipalities, which had no change in turnout. By splitting the sample between above- and below-
median income we show, in Table 5, that the EV impact on social spending is driven by above-
median income (Panel A) municipalities. This finding indicates that our previous estimations (on 
Table  3)  are  underestimated  because,  as  our  model  predicts,  lower  political  participation  biased 
toward poor places decreases social spending. Therefore, had the turnout in poorer municipalities 
not decreased due to EV, the increase in social spending would likely be larger.  

Thus,  section  6  confirms  the  results  presented  in  section  5  and  reinforces  our  model 
prediction  that  enfranchisement  of  the  poor  increases  social  spending.  In  addition,  we  provide 
evidence that the decrease in turnout caused by EV, if anything, downward bias our estimations.  

7 – Conclusion 
The  connection  between  democracy  and  representation  lies  at  the  foundation  of  political 
participation and liberties. If participation is widespread and voters are free to express their choices, 
then elected policy makers will act in the best interest of the people.  Consequently, institutions and 
rules are often devised to encourage civic involvement in politics and to promote freely contested 
elections.  For  instance,  democracies  promote  participation  by  holding  elections  on  holidays  or 
weekends, permitting absentee and early voting, and creating initiatives such as the prominent Get-
Out-The-Vote (GOTV) campaign (see Bugarin and Portugal 2015, Berinsky, Burns and Traugott 
2001, Berinsky, 2005).   

Nonetheless, campaigns to increase voting participation as absentee and early voting as well 
as GOTV, mostly increases the participation of the rich and the impact of enfranchising poor voters 
is  still  unknown.35  This  paper  shows  that  voters’  enfranchisement  in  Brazil,  concentrated  on  the 
poor  and  illiterates  that  were  no  longer  required  to  write  in  the  ballot  after  the  electronic  voting 
(EV) introduction, increased social spending. Our results indicate that public spending on health, 
education  and  public  employment  increased  by  21,  14.5  and  18.5%  respectively.  In  addition, 
municipalities 
transfers  also 
disproportionately increased in municipalities using EV by 17.7, 15 and 15.5% respectively. This 
empirical  result  corroborates  our  model  prediction  suggesting  larger  public  provision  in 
municipalities using EV.

This  paper  also  considered  Schneider’s  (2016)  finding  that  EV  reduced  turnout  in  areas 
where clientelism is stronger (poorer places). Our investigation shows that lower turnout in poorer 
municipalities  made  our  findings,  if  anything,  underestimated.  Therefore,  had  EV  not  changed 
turnout, the impact of EV on social spending would be even larger than the number we find. The 
main  contribution  of  the  present  work  is,  therefore,  to  show  the  consequences  of  de  facto 
enfranchisement on public spending and shed a light on the impact of larger turnout in democracies 
where vote is not mandatory. When electoral participation in a country is low, the level of public 
spending might not represent the choice of the majority diminishing the strength of the democracy.

average spending between 1999 and 2000) and all values are deflated. The smallest 10% municipalities were dropped to 
attenuate the per capita spending on the smallest municipalities. The analysis is restricted to municipalities with less
