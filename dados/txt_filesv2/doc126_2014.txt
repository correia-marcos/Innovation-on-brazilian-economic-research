Strategic interaction between gas and electricity sectors is a major issue in the
implementation of competitive energy markets. One relevant aspect of the problem
is the potential for input foreclosure between gas and power industries. In this
paper, we are concerned with situations where input foreclosure opportunities are
associated with the choice of market design. In particular, we study input foreclosure
in the case that the short-term capacity allocation mechanism of gas networks raises
barriers to cross-border trade. In that situation, one may ﬁnd gas markets that are
isolated only in the short term. We explain players’ ability to inﬂuence the electricity
price using their gas decisions in those isolated markets. Therefore, input foreclosure
opportunities are additional costs to be taken into account when weighing beneﬁts
and drawbacks of diﬀerent gas market designs.

Introduction

The interaction between electricity and gas industries encompasses a variety
of eﬀects and it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd a uniﬁed framework to analyze the problem.
One of the relevant aspects is the strategic interaction between them. In
particular, as the gas industry may be viewed as an intermediate product
in the supply chain of electricity, gas-electricity convergence may be viewed
as a playing ﬁeld for the theory of vertical integration.

As shown by Joskow (2005), there is not one uniﬁed theory of vertical inte-
gration —as an instance of the diﬃculty to deﬁne a uniﬁed academic posi-
tion on the issue with application to gas-power interaction, see Barqu´ın et al.
(2006) and Padilla et al. (2006). Vertical integration encompasses diﬀerent

aspects of the same problem, including a number of eﬃciency increasing ef-
fects. In fact, a large stream of the literature is devoted to show that vertical
integration has in many cases beneﬁcial eﬀects, see for instance Williamson
(1975). From this standpoint, as gas and electricity assets are typically spe-
ciﬁc, contracts are incomplete and uncertainty is relevant, one will likely
ﬁnd cases where vertical integration between gas and electricity companies
responds to industry needs. Nonetheless, vertical integration may also allow
the existence of opportunities to raise prices anti-competitively. In partic-
ular, vertical integration may be used to harm competition in the case of
input foreclosure, Ordover et al. (1990) or Hart and Tirole (1990). It de-
scribes a situation where the vertical ﬁrm can increase his rivals’ costs by
manipulating the prices in the upstream market and therefore can beneﬁt
from higher prices in the downstream market. When applied to gas-elec-
tricity integration, this would in theory allow a vertically-integrated ﬁrm to
exercise increased market power in electricity if it controls somehow the gas
market. A ﬁrst eﬀect is shown by Hunger (2003), who analyzed the problem
in the context of gas-power mergers in the US. In the study, gas producers
may raise rivals’ costs in the power market by raising long-term gas prices.

In practice, when trade can happen both at the long-term markets and at
the short-term markets, the rules of exchange may have an important im-
pact on market results. In particular, we show that analyzing only long-term
transactions does not give a complete description of the problem1. Short-
term network allocation may be an additional source of opportunities for
strategic behavior. The idea behind this is that the design of gas markets
implies the deﬁnition of a mechanism to allocate network capacity, and such
mechanism needs to deal with the trade-oﬀ eﬃciency/liquidity, Hallack and
Vazquez (2013). This trade-oﬀ comes from the fact that market arrange-
ments in gas industries have to deal with the strong speciﬁcity of gas net-
works, which in turn is the source of signiﬁcant transaction costs, Williamson
(1975), Williamson (1983) and Williamson (1985). In that view, market de-
signs have faced the trade-oﬀ between maintaining gas network speciﬁcity
(and hence obtaining eﬃcient network allocation) and reducing speciﬁcity
by deﬁning simpliﬁed common standards for products (at the cost reducing
eﬃciency). These simpliﬁed standards would be less speciﬁc and hence eas-
ier to trade in markets —see Riordan and Williamson (1985) for a general
treatment of this problem. From this standpoint, we identify additional costs
of reducing transaction costs. These additional costs are associated with in-
creased opportunities for input foreclosure in the short run. We show in this

1A ﬁrst eﬀect of this is studied in Vazquez and Barqu´ın (2007), which describes a
situation where large players may beneﬁt from avoiding to sell or buy at the short term,
thus draining liquidity from the spot market. Under this strategy, any small deviation
or imbalance can be managed internally by the large players. But these imbalances are
highly penalized for the smaller ones, as they cannot ﬁnd counter-part for trading in the
short-term market.

paper that, even if long-term gas markets are relatively competitive, mar-
ket designers should be concerned with market power opportunities in the
short run. Put it diﬀerently, even if the market for producers and suppliers
(a long-term market) is competitive enough, ineﬃcient network allocation
may result in isolated short-term markets where gas suppliers may be highly
concentrated, and hence in strong cases for input foreclosure.

Nevertheless, assessing generally the potential for those isolated markets to
appear is signiﬁcantly complex in gas markets, as there is no uniﬁed design
for network allocation mechanisms. The US market is based on long-term
pipeline contracting, complemented with considerably liquid secondary ca-
pacity trading. In the Victoria gas market, that secondary trading was im-
plemented through implicit auctions based on gas prices. The EU relies as
well on secondary network capacity trading. In that view, the rules governing
such secondary trading are central in the analysis of potential opportunities
to foreclose the market. Both the US and the Australia mechanisms are
based on highly eﬃcient mechanisms to allocate capacity. In the EU, ca-
pacity allocation mechanisms prefer to reduce eﬃciency in order to increase
liquidity. This in turn creates barriers to cross-border trading in the short
run, so national short-term markets may be isolated from the rest of Euro-
pean markets, and thus the potential for input foreclosure may be relevant.
In that view, the opportunities to foreclose the market are motivated by
the capacity allocation mechanism, and hence will be softened if it were
substituted for a more eﬃcient mechanism.

We will adopt a model-based approach to explain the impact of the ver-
tical eﬀects. Our model will be aimed at explaining the eﬀects of vertical
integration when there are opportunities to foreclose the short-term market.
With that formalization, we will then discuss whether regulation facilitates
the existence of such eﬀects. This in turn allows us to identify additional
costs of European network regulation. If one sees vertical integration as a
compromise between eﬃciency-increasing eﬀects and increased opportunities
to behave strategically, network regulations that allocate network capacity
more eﬃciently would reduce the costs of strategic interaction.

We begin in section 2 by describing the interaction between gas and elec-
tricity markets that we consider in this paper. In section 2.1, we develop a
model to study the vertical eﬀects between the downstream gas market and
the power market. Section 4 analyzes the model and obtains general factors
to characterize input foreclosure situations. Section 5 provides policy im-
plications of the previous results. Finally, section 6 collects our conclusion.
Formalization details are developed in the Appendix.

2. The interaction between gas and electricity markets

In the setting we will be considering in this paper, there is a long-term
gas international market —with time frames of about 10 or 20— where all
players in a certain market can attend to buy their gas supplies. There is
also a short-term gas market —with horizons from several hours to several
months— where market participants buy and sell gas to manage deviations
from their expected plans. Both markets require purchasing the associated
transmission rights. Such market for transmission rights is critical to analyze
the opportunities for input foreclosure.

Actually, one needs to diﬀerentiate between long-term markets for transmis-
sion and secondary trading of transmission rights. The logic for this is that
the liquidity of each market might be quite diﬀerent, and lack of liquidity
in markets for transmission rights may create barriers to trade the gas com-
modity. If there are barriers to trade transmission rights, it is sensible to
expect the existence of regional markets. In those regional markets, the gas
market structure would tend to be horizontally concentrated and thus the
opportunities for input foreclosure would increase.

The strategy we pursue in this paper is to characterize ﬁrst a game where
those barriers to trade transmission in the short run exist. With the game
characterization, we will be able to study formally the opportunities for in-
put-foreclosure strategies. Furthermore, we will identify the key parameters
that determine the potential for input foreclosure. By the analysis of that
game, thus, we will study whether or not one ﬁnds those barriers to trade,
which will be the aim of section 4.

We consider thus the market as made up of three consecutive stages. First, all
agents go to the long-term gas market to purchase their basic gas contracts.
We assume that they are all small compared with the size of the market,
so they act as pure price-takers, even if there are other players in that
market that are acting strategically —relaxing this assumption adds the
eﬀects studied in Hunger (2003). Therefore, from the strategic interaction
point of view, this stage will be irrelevant for us; we will just reﬂect it through
an long-term gas price that we will take as constant for the following stages.

Second, the short-term gas market takes place. All gas end-consumers buy
their energy in this market, and there is a price-elasticity associated with
them. Typically, the price in this market results to be higher than the long-
term price. Besides, gas-ﬁred power plants buy their opportunity gas in
this market. We will assume that this opportunity gas is sold at the same
price that resulted from the national gas market. The price will never be
lower than that, since otherwise arbitrageurs could sell all their long-term-
contracted gas in the end-user gas market and buy extra gas afterwards

4

with a proﬁt. This would tend to level both prices and will surely erode
the ability of the oligopolists to withhold gas quantity. Therefore the extra
gas will be sold at least at the short-term gas price. It could be more ex-
pensive than that, since the constraint on the opportunity gas purchases to
be positive limits the possibility of arbitrage here. In practice, it is likely
that it will be approximately the retail gas price plus some mark-up, de-
pending on the willingness to pay of the buyers and other characteristics of
this market. Although we have not modeled explicitly this eﬀect, including
it would result in additional opportunities to behave strategically. Suppliers
in this short-term market have to decide how much they would sell at this
stage, considering that they may want to reserve some gas for electricity
production at the following stage. The needs of gas contracted in advance
for electricity production are uncertain. In addition, we assume that sup-
pliers in the short-term market are concentrated enough to manipulate the
price. This assumption is made in order to formalize the idea that regional
markets may exist only in the short run. We will model this by assuming
that suppliers play Cournot strategies in this market.

Third, the electricity market takes place. Each gas-ﬁred generator may use
the remaining part of his contracted gas with no additional cost. However,
since gas purchases are made many years in advance from the actual elec-
tricity market, uncertainty is high and additional amounts of gas may be
required. The short-term gas market is not liquid enough, so electricity pro-
ducers have to buy this extra gas to the few ﬁrms that do trade in the short
run.

2.1. Formalization of the game

Most of the models concerned with strategic behavior in gas markets focus
on the relationship between the upstream and downstream of gas markets,
assuming that some of their players are oligopolists. To our knowledge, the
ﬁrst work modeling market power in gas markets is Mathisien et al. (1987).
In Mulder and Zwart (2005) the gas market is represented by means of a
small number of strategic gas producers, and price-taking gas traders in
the downstream market. Boots et al. (2004) model the gas market as a
sequence of oligopolistic markets in gas production (upstream) and trading
(downstream). Holtz et al. (2008) model the same structure of the market,
but relax some assumptions of Boots et al. (2004), such as the approach of
modeling the domestic production as an exogenous variable.

The aim of our study, on the other hand, is to analyze the interaction be-
tween the gas and the electricity market in the short run. In that view, a
relevant part of that interaction takes place between the downstream gas
market and the electricity market. So in our model, we represent a sequence

5

of an oligopolistic gas market (the short-term market) and an oligopolistic
power market. We thus implicitly assume a competitive upstream gas mar-
ket. In doing so, our modeling strategy will be close to Barqu´ın (2006) and
Crampes and Hernandez-Alva (2007).

Summing up, we will describe the interaction between electricity and gas
markets as a two-stage game, where the electricity market players decide
their output in the electricity market once the gas market has cleared. We
model the two markets as non-cooperative games in quantities.

To set up the game, we ﬁrst deﬁne the proﬁt-maximization problem of each
ﬁrm. The problem we will describe in this section builds on a market made
up of N ﬁrms with positions both in the gas and in the electricity markets.
The time-uncertainty setting is deﬁned by two periods (date 0 and date 1),
and S states of nature at date 1. It represents a situation where the gas
market takes place at date 0 subject to an uncertain power market at date
1. The possible states at date 1 will be denoted by s = 1, , S.
In addition, player i ∈ N has a preference ordering on the revenues set
Ri = Ri
S, and we will assume that the ordering can be expressed by a
utility function:

0, , Ri

U i : (cid:60)S+1 → (cid:60)

This utility function, thus, deﬁnes the producers’ preferences for each state
of nature, and it is assumed transitive, convex and complete.

Gas market decisions are deﬁned by the maximization of the income in the
short-term market, πgV i, where πg is the price of the gas market and V i
is the ﬁrm i’s sales in the gas market. In addition, all ﬁrms must purchase
their gas sales from a certain gas producer. This step is not represented in
the model, and we assume all the trades have been made before short-term
decisions take place. It is summarized by the variable Ai, which represents
the gas purchases of ﬁrm i ∈ N . Hence, ﬁrm i buys the amount Ai in advance
both for selling in the gas market and for producing electricity. The price of
the gas supplies bought in advance through long-term contracts is denoted
by pg.
In the power market stage, πp
s is the price of the electricity market at state
s and ci
is
the ﬁrm i’s output of her non-gas-ﬁred power plants. qG,i
is the ﬁrm i’s gas
purchases in the gas markets to produce with of her gas-ﬁred power plants.
qC,i
is the ﬁrm i’s part of her gas purchases dedicated to production with of
s
her gas-ﬁred power plants.

s is the ﬁrm i’s variable cost of her non-gas-ﬁred power plants. qN,i

Incentives for cross-industry input foreclosure

Gas-ﬁred generators often purchase much of their gas supplies in the long-
term gas market. We assume that this market is liquid enough, so no ﬁrm
in the demand side has the ability to manipulate it. In that view, none of
the companies operating in the short-term gas market, selling gas to the
end customers, would have any inﬂuence on the price that the electricity
producers pay for their long-term gas, and both segments of the demand
(end users and power producers) would become in practice two completely
separated markets. Considering the market for long-term supplies alone,
vertical integration provides no additional opportunity to exercise market
power, since the electricity price is independent from the price in the short-
gas market that gas oligopolists control.

In that situation, we ﬁnd that:

7

Result 1 (No cross-industry input foreclosure). Given that player’s behavior
is described by problem (1), if no ﬁrm is producing with opportunity gas,
there are no opportunities of input foreclosure.

The equilibrium gas price is given by the Cournot pricing condition for the
short-term gas market:

πg = pg + αgV i

(4)

This result is derived in the Appendix.

However, gas-ﬁred power plants usually need to buy some extra gas in the
short-term gas market in order to compensate for deviations from their ex-
pected plans. And this opportunity gas (short-term gas) needs to be bought
in the market that oligopolists control. This is a potential case for input
foreclosure. In that view, the simplest situation of input foreclosure would
describe a gas monopolist that also owns a power company. A raise in the
price of gas automatically implies a raise in the cost of fuel for the combined
cycle generators and, depending on the load curve, a raise in the electricity
price of some hours. The monopolist beneﬁts from three factors: a higher
price for the gas it sells directly to customers —in balance with a loss of
income derived from a reduction in consumption; a higher price for the gas
it sells for power generation —in balance with a reduction in the production
of the gas-ﬁred units as they become more expensive; and a higher price
for the rest of the electricity it is producing. The ﬁrst two terms are the
same ones that any equivalent monopolist faces when competing against
demand elasticity, but the third one is a direct consequence of vertical in-
tegration, and it is providing extra beneﬁts when the gas price is raised.
This means that there is an additional incentive for the ﬁrm to raise gas
prices. In other words, the quantity that is aﬀected by an increase in gas
prices is not just the amount of gas sales —as it happens in the problem
of the gas monopolist. It is related to his electricity sales, especially those
coming from non-gas-ﬁred generators. This represents a worsening eﬀect on
the market abuse conditions that arises when the gas monopolist integrates
with an electricity ﬁrm.

However, short-term gas markets do not correspond to the relatively simple
setting above. In our setting, the previous example is a particular case of it,
so it reﬂects the factors that explain the interdependence between the gas
price and the electricity price. In particular, we can derive from the model
the following result:

Result 2 (Cross-industry input foreclosure). Given that player’s behavior is
described by problem (1), if K ﬁrms including ﬁrm i are buying opportunity
gas in the short-term market, ﬁrm i has two additional incentives: a) the loss
of proﬁts associated with the higher gas price for her own gas-ﬁred power

8

plants and b) the increase of proﬁts associated with the increase in infra-
marginal rents.

The equilibrium contains the following pricing condition for the short-term
gas market:

This result is also derived in the Appendix.
As shown in the Appendix, Ei,∗ represents the risk-neutral expectation of
player i for the power market. In addition, the Lagrange multiplier µgas,i
represents the trade-oﬀ between increasing marginally V i (supplying one
megawatt more to the short-term gas market) and using the contracted gas
to produce electricity. Hence, when ﬁrms are deciding on short-term sales in
the gas market, they take account of the opportunity costs of selling in the
future power market. That opportunity cost is given by (see the Appendix
for the details of the derivation):

which is the risk neutral expectation of marginal proﬁts in the power market
associated with using contracted gas to produce electricity. Note that if there
= 0 and the expression
reduces to the (risk-aﬀected) Cournot pricing equation of the power market,
using the long-term gas price as the cost for ﬁring the power plant.

By analogy with the ﬁrst result, we observe two additional terms, which
represents the eﬀects of vertical integration. In particular:

• The term αgEi,∗[qG,i] describes player i’s valuation of the possibility
of using opportunity gas in the future power market. And this player’s
valuation is the risk-neutral expectation of future consumption of op-
portunity gas.

• The term αgEi,∗(cid:104)(cid:16) K

N +1 (qN,i + qG,i + qC,i)

describes how changes in
the oligopolistic behavior in the electricity market aﬀect the agent’s
proﬁt. It represents the increase in proﬁts due to the increase in power
prices associated with raising rivals’ fuel costs. As shown in the Ap-
pendix, Ks
N +1 αg describes the increase in power prices in state s when
gas sales decreases marginally, i.e. the ability of ﬁrm i to raise the

(cid:17)(cid:105)

9

power price through decisions in the gas market. Firm i’s electricity
production qN,i + qG,i + qC,i represents the incentives of the power
price.

This last term is the increased market power due to the fact that raising the
price of the gas market aﬀects the electricity market. The value of this latter
term depends on the value of K, i.e. the number of ﬁrms producing with
opportunity gas, which is uncertain when deciding in the gas market. If all
the generating ﬁrms are using this gas K and input foreclosure is maximized.
The more opportunity gas consumers, the more additional market power for
the ﬁrm i.

Consequently, the oligopolistic eﬀects described by (Result 2) is threefold.
On the one hand it represents the usual horizontal eﬀect of the market
power, that is, withholding gas output forces the gas price to raise. On the
other hand, it shows one of the eﬀects of vertical integration: when the ﬁrm
raise the gas price, the marginal cost of its electricity production is risen
as well. This would tend to lower gas prices. And ﬁnally, the ability of gas
suppliers to aﬀect the behavior of other players in the electricity market and
to beneﬁt from it.

4. Network allocation mechanisms and transmission

services flexibility

The key parameter to deﬁne input-foreclosure eﬀects is the amount of ﬁrms
buying opportunity gas in the short-term market, deﬁned by K. These power
producers have to choose between limiting themselves severely to the gas
the have bought in the long term, or buying to some of the ﬁrms controlling
the short-term gas market (and thus creating the incentives for input fore-
closure). Hence, the additional potential for input foreclosure that we had
identiﬁed is based on the idea that a part of the gas for these combined cycles
has to be bought in a small market controlled by incumbents. This creates
a local oligopoly for these sales that results in the conﬂictive incentives.

We will next analyze the diﬀerent schemes to implement mechanisms to allo-
cate network resources, in order to identify the determinants of the creation
of such local oligopolies. In that view, gas market liberalization has been im-
plemented in signiﬁcantly diﬀerent ways, and most of those diﬀerences can
be traced to the diﬀerent mechanisms designed to allocate network services.
Gas networks operation is characterized by tight technical constraints, and
hence the contracting architecture required to implement the commodity de-
livery at diﬀerent points of the network must be complex. This is the source
of signiﬁcant transaction costs. In particular, dealing with spatial speciﬁcity
has motivated a wide range of design solutions, Vazquez et al. (2012).

10

In that view, it is possible to reduce the speciﬁcity of each feasible trade by
simplifying its spatial characteristics. By doing so, the diﬃculties to trade
are reduced and the number of market players trading the same product in-
creases. That simpliﬁcation strategy, on the other hand, implies that several
network services will be allocated equally among all network users regard-
less their preferences. This in turn creates ineﬃciencies that may result in
barriers to cross-border trade.

4.1. Spatial flexibility and capacity allocation

The less simpliﬁed mechanism to allocate network resources is a point-to-
point gas transmission arrangement. In it, a large part of the spatial char-
acteristics of the trade is deﬁned in the agreement. Hence, point-to-point
transmission is relatively diﬃcult to trade. This is the typical scheme fol-
lowed in the US and Australian gas markets. Both systems are supposed to
allocate most of the spatial characteristics of the network using market-based
mechanisms, although both systems diﬀer in several fundamental features.
The US system is based on long-term bilateral agreements between pipeline
operators and network users, complemented with liquid short-term trading
of capacity, Makholm (2012). The Australian system, on the other hand,
uses an implicit mechanism to allocate capacity in the short run. The mech-
anisms can be viewed as a combinatorial auction where network capacity is
allocated implicitly according to gas prices, Ruﬀ (2012). Under suﬃciently
liquid secondary trading, both schemes are equivalent in terms of short-term
eﬃciency2.

The EU design may be viewed as a third way that aims to combine the char-
acteristics of the two schemes. It is characterized by a combination of explicit
and implicit allocation of gas transmission services, Vazquez et al. (2012).
Such combination is built on the explicit allocation of only some of transmis-
sion services. The allocation mechanism is called entry/exit allocation. The
idea behind it is to simplify the network topology to a simpler set of entry
and exit points (a commercial network that represent partially the physical
network). All explicit allocation is reduced to buying separately entry and
exit rights. After that, shippers do not need to buy additional transmission
rights (such as ﬂexibility rights) but they are allocated implicitly according
to a set of rules deﬁned by the regulator. Such allocation mechanism is called
virtual hub. With it, one avoids the explicit allocation and renegotiation of
complex spatial characteristics of the network, but it comes at the cost of
severe diﬃculties in the calculation of the capacity to be sold.

2See Hallack and Vazquez (2012) for discussion on additional eﬀects of those two dif-

ferent schemes.

11

4.2.

Identifying barriers to cross-border trade in European

systems

Entry/exit schemes market players only reveal preferences on the right to
enter and exit the gas systems. Within the system, all injections and with-
drawals are considered to have the same price. From the point of view of
this paper, the main characteristic is that it gives network users free spatial
ﬂexibility within the system, which in turn creates barriers to cross-border
trade.

4.2.1. Capacity allocation

Entry-exit regimes may be thought of as a system where transmission con-
straints are moved to the borders. That is, entry-exit capacity allocation
calculates the network capacity that allows shippers to trade within the
zone without transmission constraints. In practice, the transmission capac-
ity oﬀered to market participants has to be lower than the physical limits
of the transmission system. This under-use of transmission capacity is part
of the design, which bears that cost in order to promote zonal market liq-
uidity (by giving spatial ﬂexibility). But the entry/exit system also implies
an increase of the transmission constraints in the cross-border. The capacity
made commercially available at the borders has to be lower than the phys-
ical capacity of interconnection. Hence, the within-zone network ﬂexibility
entails a barrier for cross-border trade.

Consider for instance an injection at a certain entry point A. Giving the right
to the shipper of trading everywhere within the zone containing A implies
that the capacity sold at A is lower than the physical capacity. Consider the
same situation in a diﬀerent zone with an entry point B. If a trader were
willing to enter through point A, but to sell in the zone of point B, the
trader would be facing a reduction of capacity twice. That is, the problem
of underused capacity is faced twice with cross-border trade between two
entry/exit zones: a ﬁrst one when injecting at A and a second one when
injecting at B. This represents a barrier to cross-border trade.

4.2.2. Network tariﬀs

In entry/exit systems, the costs of the network cannot be allocated accord-
ing to the actual use of the network, because the prices for entry and exit
points on the commercial network do not represent the costs generated by
the physical gas ﬂows that they generate. Consequently, one always ﬁnds
cross-subsidies among shippers, which are caused by the spatial ﬂexibility
given inside the trading zone. In that view, tariﬀs are not cost-reﬂective, but

12

that may be a bearable cost when compared to the increase of within-zone
liquidity.

However entry/exit systems create tariﬀ distortions that are especially rele-
vant when crossing zones. This often results in higher costs for a cross-zone
trade. Actually, network users are charged several entry and exit charges
in multiple zones, which may result in ’pancaking’, meaning that multiple
tariﬀs are added on a single transaction. Put it diﬀerently, spatial ﬂexibil-
ity is given to shippers at the entry to all zones. And the network tariﬀs
paid at each entry cannot be cost-reﬂective, often resulting in cross-subsi-
dies. Therefore, a shipper crossing two zones would face the diﬃculty twice.
Thus, those non-cost-reﬂective tariﬀs increase the costs of cross-zone trade
as compared to the costs of gas trade within the zone. The eﬀects of tar-
iﬀ distortion increase when crossing zones, creating additional barriers to
trade.

Implications: Effects of different carriage systems

Summing up, we have identiﬁed additional potential for short-term input
foreclosure with local oligopolies that exist only in the short run. Besides,
we have showed that markets designs providing spatial ﬂexibility to shippers
facilitate the existence of those local oligopolies. In that view, the US and
Australia markets rely on point-to-point transmission allocation. This in
turn implies that the spatial ﬂexibility provided by the network rules is
minimal. So if the network is meshed enough, it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd situations
where a certain consumption point is subject to input foreclosure. But if that
consumption point is connected to the network through, for instance, a single
pipeline, it is possible to ﬁnd situations where a large gas supplier purchase
gas in the hub and exercise market power at the isolated consumption point.

On the other hand, in the EU gas systems, market designs do provide ample
spatial ﬂexibility. Moreover, the zone where free spatial ﬂexibility is given
is limited to national borders. That is, within a certain national system,
market participants can trade gas without network constraints. This in turn
implies that network constraints are moved to national borders, creating bar-
riers to cross-border trade. Those barriers to cross-border trade represents
additional potential for the existence of isolated national systems.

In that view, assume that we could implement a more eﬃcient (in the sense
of giving less free spatial ﬂexibility) management of the gas network, so in-
ternational traders (players outside the initially isolated national market)
could make opportunity deals with the national companies without commit-
ting to very long-term agreements of network capacity. If the international
traders had easy access to the national gas grid, then there would be plenty

13

of potential sellers willing to participate in the opportunity gas market.
As the supply side of the short-term market is more competitive, most of
the gas of the electricity producers would be priced at values that could
not be inﬂuenced by gas suppliers, thus eliminating the potential for input
foreclosure. Therefore, as entry/exit capacity allocation creates barriers to
cross-border trade, it facilitates the existence of local oligopolies, and local
oligopolies was the source of the case for input foreclosure that we identiﬁed
in the previous section. Hence, entry/exit capacity allocation increases the
potential for input foreclosure.

In general, determining the relevant market in the short run is critical to
assess the potential for input foreclosure. Even when long-term markets are
competitive enough, lack of liquidity in short-term trading of network ca-
pacity may create opportunities for input foreclosure. Put it diﬀerently, if
transmission capacity may not be available in the short run, one may ﬁnd
isolated oligopolies where potential for input foreclosure exists, regardless
the competitiveness of the long-term markets. But, if transmission alloca-
tion mechanisms provide free spatial ﬂexibility, these isolated zones may be
motivated by the rules of network use deﬁned in the regulation. Hence, this
is an additional cost that should be taken into account when deciding on
the rules of network use.

6. Conclusion

The analysis above shows that the key factor in the existence of a case for
input foreclosure is the ability of a gas agent to manipulate the gas price
faced by her competitors in the power market. There are essentially two cases
for input foreclosure. The ﬁrst one is related to a certain ﬁrm with position
both in the upstream gas market and in the power market. This is the case
described in Hunger (2003). The second one, described in this paper, has to
do with a market structure where several ﬁrms need to purchase short-term
gas supplies in a local oligopoly. In that situation, power producers have
to choose between limiting themselves severely to the gas they have bought
in the long run, or buying from some of the ﬁrms operating in the local
short-term market.

By identifying the second type of input-foreclosure situations, we have shown
that the particular design of the gas market has a critical inﬂuence on the
existence of cases for input foreclosure. In particular, giving free spatial
ﬂexibility moves congestion to national borders, creating in turn barriers
to trade in the short run. Thus, EU market designs, which builds on ample
provision of free spatial ﬂexibility, creates barriers to cross-border trade, and
hence potential for the existence of isolated national markets where there

14

are opportunities to foreclose the market. This is not the case of systems
based on point-to-point transmission.

Therefore, if cross-border barriers are weaken (by reducing free spatial ﬂex-
ibility), so that international traders have easy access to the national gas
grid, then there will be more potential sellers willing to participate in the
short-term gas market. Competition among them would limit the ability of
national ﬁrms to manipulate the short-term price. Hence, electricity produc-
ers would be priced at values that could not be inﬂuenced by the national
companies, eliminating the potential for input foreclosure. This is an addi-
tional cost that must be taken into account when deciding on the design of
the capacity allocation mechanism.

A. Representation of players’ behavior

In this section we characterize the opportunities of players to behave strate-
gically. To do so, we analyze the optimality conditions of problem (1). The
Lagrangean function of problem (1) is given by:

L =(πg − pg)V i + U (Ri

s − ci

In addition, using the inverse demand equation (2) and (3), we have the
following price derivatives:

∂πp

and

∂πg

∂V i = −αg

where qx,i

is power production with any kind of fuel.

As Lagrange multipliers are marginal utilities at date 0 of an additional
unit of spot proﬁts, they can be thought of as discount factors for each state
of nature. No-arbitrage conditions impose that each µi
s are positive values.
That is equivalent to the condition that the problem has a solution, see for
instance Magill and Quinzi (2002).

sxs = λiEN [x],
where EN denotes the expectation with respect to the previously deﬁned
probabilities, and λi can be interpreted as the discount on the riskless asset.
That is, the forward price is its discounted expected payoﬀ in the sense of
artiﬁcially constructed probabilities. We will use E∗ to denote discounted
expectations, Ei,∗ = λiEN .

The Lagrange multiplier µgas,i
represents the trade-oﬀ between increasing
marginally V i (supplying one megawatt more to the short-term gas market)
and using the contracted gas to produce electricity. Hence, this equation
states that the costs taken in to account when deciding on short-term sales
in the gas market are made up of the price in the long-term market pg and

the opportunity costs of selling in the future power market(cid:80)
subject to uncertainty, that incentive is deﬁned by(cid:80)
(cid:88)

The incentive to raise the gas price is deﬁned, on the one hand, by the ben-
eﬁts for the ﬁrm’s gas sales V i, and on the other by the additional costs
of buying opportunity gas at a higher price, qG,i
. As the power market is

player’s valuation of the possibility of using opportunity gas in the future
power market. This player’s valuation is the risk-neutral expectation of fu-

Therefore, when ∂πp

electricity. In that view, the main eﬀects of vertical integration that we are
considering in this paper are represented by the term ∂πp

Putting together the equations (8) and (10), it is possible to obtain

We can identify two basic cases:

• A certain state of nature s has spare long-term gas. In this case,
µmin,i
> 0 as the minimum production constraint of opportunity gas
s
will be active. Besides, µgas,i
= 0 because the ﬁrm is using less gas
than contracted, so the corresponding constraint will not be active.
From above we have that

s

s(πg − pg)

• A certain state of nature s has spare long-term gas. This is the com-
plementary case of the previous one. As ﬁrms are producing with op-
portunity gas, µmin,i
= 0. On the other hand, as all contracted gas is
used, µgas,i

In that view, the price sensitivity will depend on the number of ﬁrms that
are consuming opportunity gas. Let us use the parameter Ks to denote the
number of ﬁrms purchasing gas in the short run, at state s. Thus,

s = πp

That is, the power price reacts proportionally to the amount of ﬁrms us-
ing opportunity gas, divided by the number of ﬁrms plus one, because it
takes into account also the demand reaction. Note that if no ﬁrm is using
opportunity gas, Ks = 0 and hence ∂πp

s

∂V i = 0.

C. Representation of input foreclosure opportunities

Combining both results we can derive (Result 1) and (Result 2). In particu-
lar, optimality condition (7) can be written as:

and Ks = 0. Moreover, as not buying opportunity gas means that the ﬁrm

has spare contracted gas,(cid:80)
