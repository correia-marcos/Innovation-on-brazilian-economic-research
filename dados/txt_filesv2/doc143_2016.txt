Resumo 

Estudiosos da inovação e elaboradores de política têm reservado intensa atenção à existência 

de políticas de compras como forma de aumentar o esforço inovador e de fornecer o ambiente 

adequado à inovação, incentivando a interação entre firmas e outras organizações. Este artigo 

objetiva  aferir  o  efeito  da  política  de  compras  da  Petrobras  no  contexto  da  política  de 

conteúdo local no setor de petróleo e gás durante o governo Lula. Usando microdados da RAIS, 

o artigo compara o desempenho dos fornecedores de equipamentos da indústria do petróleo e 

gás com uma amostra de controle obtida pelo uso de técnicas de propensity score matching. 

Os  resultados  sugerem  que  ser  um  fornecedor  do  setor  aumenta  o  esforço  inovador  da 

empresa. O artigo sugere que o esforço tecnológico dos fornecedores é 2.5 pontos percentuais 

maior  do  que  a  amostra  de  fornecedores.  Esse  resultado  sugere  que  a  política  foi  bem-

sucedida e que maior atenção deve ser dada a instrumentos de política pelo lado da demanda.

Abstract 

Students  of  innovation  policy  and  policymakers  have  increasingly  focused  on  procurement 

policy  as  an  alternative  for  enhancing 

innovative  effort  and  providing  an  adequate 

environment for  interactions between  innovative  firms  and organizations. This  paper  aims to 

assess the effect of procurement policy performed by Petrobras under the local content policy 

in the oil and gas sector. Using microdata from RAIS, the paper compares the performance of 

oil and gas equipment supplies firms with a control sample built through the use of propensity 

score  matching  sampling.  The  results  suggest  that  being  a  supplier  to  the  oil  and  gas  sector 

improves  firm’s  innovative  effort.  The  paper  estimates  that  Petrobras  suppliers’  ratio  of 

technological  personnel  to  total  number  of  employees  is  2.5  percentage  points  above  the 

control  sample.  This  result  suggests  that  policy  has  been  successful  and  further  attention 

should be directed towards demand instruments.

INTRODUCTION 

For many years, scholars and policymakers have downplayed the role of demand in innovative 

settings.  As  a  consequence,  innovative  policy  has  mostly  been  directed  towards  correcting 

market  imperfections  on  the  supply  side.  Innovative  instruments  such  as  public  subsidies  to 

innovation, tax credits and public financing have been the main channels used by policymakers 

(Edquist  and  Hommen  2000,  Edler  and  Georghiou  2007  and  Guerzoni  and  Raiteri  2015). 

Whenever applied, demand side policies have remained as a hidden agenda and their results 

have  very  rarely  been  put  under  spotlight.  However,  in  these  cases,  governmental  agencies 

and  state  companies  have  acted  as  coordinators  of  a  network  of  suppliers  (Block  2008  and 

Mazzucato 2011).  

Petrobras,  the  Brazilian  state-owned  oil  company  (SOC),  has  since  its  birth  been  a  state 

instrument  for  the  development  of  downstream  and  upstream  firms.  Though  Cardoso’s 

administration  (1995-2002)  reduced  Petrobras’  focus  on  supplier  development  and  the 

importance of Petrobras’ demand to domestic industrial companies, during Lula’s two terms, 

the resurgence of quality control programs and of domestic suppliers’ development programs 

was  coupled  with  a  national  content  policy  that  increasingly  established  national  content 

goals.  

It  is  clear  that  this  shift  in  public  policy  may  have  had  consequences  in  firms’  conduct. 

Assessment  of  the  results  of  this  shift  in  policy  seems  to  be  an  interesting  agenda.  Previous 

work on this thematic has focused on the impact over growth and exports (IPEA 2011) and on 

the sources of innovative behavior (De Oliveira and Rocha 2008 and Rocha 2015). Nonetheless, 

little light has been thrown on the impact national content policy has had on innovative effort.  

This paper aims to assess the effect of demand oriented policy performed by Petrobras under 

the national content goals established by Agência Nacional do Petróleo (ANP). The paper uses 

microdata  from  Relação  Anual  de  Informações  Sociais  (RAIS).  The  paper  creates  a  quasi-

experimental  setting  building  a  counterfactual  sample  through  propensity  score  matching. 

After forming the control sample, we run Schumpeterian based models to assess the impact of 

procurement policy on innovation efforts. 

The  paper  is  organized  in  six  sections,  including  this  introduction.  Section  two  presents  an 

analytical framework based on previous literature on the subject and defines the contribution 

of this paper. Section three describes the national content policy in the oil and gas sector and 

the  instruments  Petrobras  has  designed  to  cope  with  the  task  of  domestic  acquisition  of 

materials  and  services.  Section  four  describes  the  database  and  presents  the  methodology 

used in the paper. Section five presents the results and section six shows the conclusions.   

2.  ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK  

Two  different  views  usually  motivate  innovative  policies.  On  the  one  hand,  there  are  those 

who understand policies should be designed to correct for market imperfections; on the other 

hand, there are those that seek governmental intervention as  builders  of networks. The first 

perception is generally focused on correcting market imperfections, such as uncertainty or lack 

of  appropriablity.  Proposed  mechanisms  are  typically  the  structuring  of  property  rights 

instruments and the correction of market prices under the effect of externalities. In this case, 

resources may be  channeled through the financing of R&D activities, the building of financial 

mechanisms  and  institutions,  such  as  venture  capital  funds,  the  supply  of  non-reimbursable 

funds or the implementation of subsidies and tax exemptions for innovative activities.  

The  second  perception  emphasizes  the  interactive  character  of  innovative  activities  and 

stresses the importance of structuring innovative networks. Emphasis is directed towards the 

interaction between different set of actors such as universities, research institutions, small and 

large firms. Supply and demand tend to be linked.  

One should thus distinguish between direct and indirect innovation policies (Edquist, Hommen 

and Tsipouri 2000). In the first case, policy instruments pursue the enhancement of innovative 

activities through general changes in institutional framework, in the second case, instruments 

aim  to  cultivate  interaction.  In  the  latter  setting,  public  organizations  are  directly  involved  in 

pursuing and building interaction.  

Three  factors  have  however  been  responsible  for  overshadowing  government  procurement. 

First,  the  demand-pull-technology-push  debate  of  the  80’s  downplayed  the  importance  of 

demand and emphasized the protagonism of supply factors in innovative settings (Dosi 1982, 

Scherer 1982). Second, demand policies suffered resistance from those opposed to picking the 

winner  policies.  Third,  WTO  agreements  imposed  restrictions  to  such  policies,  leading 

governments either to cease them (European Union) or to build a hidden agenda (USA) (Edler 

and Georghiou 2007, Mazzucato 2011).  

Empirical evidence has however favored government procurement policies. Litchenberg (1987) 

tested  the  effect  of  federally  financed  R&D  on  R&D  expenditures.  However,  whenever  he 

introduced controls for sales derived from government procurement, the sign of the effect of 

federal finance to R&D variable on R&D expenditures became insignificant and the real effect 

on company R&D expenditures was found to be on the sales to government procurement. This 

conclusion  is  clearly  associated  with  increases  in  future  revenues  and  therefore  with  the 

potential  of  public  procurement  to  positively  affect  R&D  expenditures.  Lichtenberg  (1988) 

used a sample of 165 companies, controlling for industry characteristics and time variables, to 

test  whether  competitive or  non-competitive  government  procurement  affect  company  R&D 

expenditures. He concludes for a positive effect of government procurement, much larger than 

other  policy  instruments.  Geroski  (1990)  also  finds  evidence  for  the  good  performance  of 

public  procurement.  Guerzoni  and  Raiteri  (2015)  control  for  possible  interaction  between  a 

diversity  of  supply  policy  and  demand  policy  instruments,  arriving  to  a  similar  conclusion  as 

Litchenberg  that  whenever  controlled  for  demand  policy  instruments,  supply  policy  tend  to 

reduce its effectiveness and that demand policy instruments remains relevant.  

Most importantly, there have been a number of recent studies that have renewed the interest 

in procurement policy due to the possibility of interaction between agents that procurement 

may iprovide (Mazzucato 2011, Block 2008 and Edler and Georghiou 2007). More specifically, 

Block (2008) argues that the US has kept hidden a developmental State that has implemented 

a series of successful interventions. According to his research, the results are unchallenged and 

a large number of the main innovations in the US have followed projects that were funded by 

governmental agencies.  

Guerzoni and Raitieri (2015) define public procurement innovation policy as the one where a 

public agency places and order products that do not exist at the time, but could be delivered if 

interaction  with  the  public  agency  takes  place.  In  the  Brazilian  context,  nonetheless,  one 

should consider that it not necessarily involves novelty to the international market, but in the 

domestic market context where these firms carry out their activities. More adequately, Edquist 

and  Hommen  (2000)  list  a  set  of  instruments  that  may  be  present  in  these  settings  and  that 

enhance 

innovative  efforts.  First, 

innovation  procurement  policies  may  provide  early 

sophisticated  demand  for  domestic  firms.  This  means  that  new  services  and  products  that 

would not be otherwise demanded or that would only be demanded through exports may find 

a  new  demand  in  the  public  sector.  Second,  procurement  may  set  stringent  patterns  and 

benchmarking  for  domestic  firms.  Quality  control  may  be  implemented.  Third,  procurement 

policy may encourage domestic firms “to act as 'lead users' in setting leading-edge standards 

for  domestic  producers”  (Edquist  and  Hommen  p.  62)  and  therefore  contribute  to 

international  competitiveness  of  domestic  industry.  Fourth,  and  maybe  most  importantly, 

procurement  policy  should  facilitate  innovation  and  should  emphasize  the  complementary 

strengths of firms in different positions of the product chain and seek the coordination of their 

actions, stimulating the establishment of linkages and flows of knowledge amongst firms and 

other organizations. Fifth, it should stimulate competition. Competitive dynamics is important 

to offer the tensions needed for innovation inducement and for a health network of innovative 

actors.  

3.  NATIONAL CONTENT POLICY IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR IN BRAZIL 

The  employment  of  a  national  content  policy  for  the  oil  and  gas  sector  under  Lula’s 

government represented a major step towards the establishing of a public procurement policy. 

National  content  clauses  were  present  in  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  production  contracts 

since  the  first  bidding  round  that  took  place  in  1999  (president  Cardoso’s  second  term).  The 

main  purpose  of  local  content  requirements  were  “to  allow  locally  established  goods  and 

service providers to participate in the oil and gas supply chain and increase their market share 

in  a  competitive  basis”  (ANP  2012).1  However,  until  the  fourth  round,  the  clause  expressed 

preference  to  domestic  suppliers,  but  did  not  include  any  particular  national  content  target. 

Rounds  five  and  six  contracts,  that  took  place  in  2003  and  2004,  first  established  minimum 

percentages  based  on  whether  blocks  were  located  onshore,  offshore  shallow  water  or 

offshore deep water. In 2005, authorities established a methodology to measure local content. 

In  2007,  minimum  and  maximum  local  content  levels  were  imposed  per  equipment.  This 

regulation  still  holds  up  to  today.  Regulation  became  stricter  as  time  went  by.  Moreover, 

monitoring  became  tighter  and  ANP  played  an  increasing  role  in  this  matter.2  More 

importantly,  local  content  began  to  play  a  central  role  in  oil  and  gas  policy  in  Brazil  and  the 

fulfillment  of  these  requirements  became  a  central  concern  for  policy  makers,  oil  companies 

and major suppliers.  

In order to measure national content, authorities developed a rule book to be followed by oil 

and gas suppliers from the 7th round on. This rule books submits to certification every item and 

sub  item  acquired  by  oil  and  gas  companies  and  their  EPCs  in  exploration  and  production 

activities. This trend towards stricter local content requirements has been criticized and later 

on we should deal with it.  

Petrobras, the Brazilian NOC, is the main oil operator in Brazil, producing around 90% of total 

oil. Up to 2013, it held the third largest R&D budget amongst the world’s oil and gas operators 
                                                             
1  Procurement  policy  does  not  distinguish  locally  established  multinational  affiliates  from  domestic 
capital firms.  

2 Regulation ANP no. 9/2007 establishes the frequency, the format and the content of local investments 
reports made with exploration and production development activities 

and had the largest R&D to  sales ratio  (Rocha 2015). Petrobras acts in almost  every stage of 

the oil and gas production chain, such as exploration, production, refining and transportation. 

Most importantly, Petrobras’ activities in exploration and production involve the development 

of new technology to achieve deep water and ultra-deep water oil production, being also the 

only  company  that  operates  in  pre-salt  conditions.  These  features  is  important  to  settle  that 

Petrobras operates in challenging and innovative conditions. 

One  important  issue  about  the  general  use  of  local  content  policies  in  Brazil  is  whether 

Petrobras  has  been  able  to  positively 

influence  suppliers’ 

learning  and  knowledge 

accumulation process. IPEA (2011) tried to provide an answer to this question. They show that, 

on average, Petrobras’s suppliers are larger, have  a larger percentage of scientific  personnel, 

engineers,  greater  wages  and  better  education.  Therefore,  Petrobras’  suppliers  are  amongst 

the  most  qualified  firms  in  the  Brazilian  economy.  So,  one  important  question  would  be 

whether  Petrobras  adds  value  to  its  suppliers.  De  Negri  et  al.  (2011)  use  propensity  score 

matching  techniques  to  define  a  control  group  with  respect  to  a  set  of  characteristics. 

Analyzing the treated sample (Petrobras  suppliers) against the control  sample,  they  find that 

Petrobras’  procurement  has  positive  and  continued  effect  on  firm  growth,  labor  force 

education level and wages (which may be an indicator for productivity). They however find a 

negative  impact  on  exports.  Though  there  is  no  test  run  by  De  Negri  et  al.  (2011),  one  may 

speculate  that  this  negative  effect  may  be  result  of  the  redirecting  of  resources  towards  the 

greater opportunities provided by Petrobras. 

It  is  true  that  Petrobras  chooses  better  firms.  A  supplier  certificate  (CRCC)  that  authorizes 

departments to acquire goods or services has to be issued. Apart from formalities associated 

with  the  legal  status  of  firms,  Petrobras  requires  social  responsibility,  environmental  and 

health certifications  (respectively, ETHOS, ISO  14001 and ISO  18001). If the supplier provides 

critical products, product quality certification (ISO 9001) is required. It is well known that very 

often firms enhance their market value when they obtain CRCC from Petrobras.3 Nonetheless, 

firms that become Petrobras’ suppliers have their overall costs increased in order to cope with 

the requirements of the certifications. This has been stressed by some of the suppliers. They 

tell  that  they  leave  one  type  of  market  that  takes  price  as  the  most  important  variable  and 

enter another market where quality has an important role (also Oliveira and Rocha 2008).  

                                                             
3 Oliveira and Rocha (2008) tell an anecdote that illustrates this case. One firm had its property structure changed. 
There were two partners. One of them left the partnership to open one company in the same line of business. The 
certificate was negotiated as the main part of the deal. Another case was related to an affiliate of a multinational 
enterprise 

However,  Petrobras  also  acts  to  improve  suppliers’  product  quality.  Quality  control  may  be 

divided  into  two  main  procedures:  the  technical  audits  for  suppliers  (ATF)  and  the  Quality 

Guarantee Program for Services and Materials (PGMQSA). The ATF is composed of inspections 

that may be more or less intensive during production and delivery of the product, according to 

the supplier qualification as classified by the Procurement Department. Usually the intensity of 

audit  is  associated  with  the  product  line.  Suppliers  complain  a  lot  about  audit  procedures 

saying  that  they  increase  their  costs.  However,  they  agree  that  some  of  the  required 

procedures make their products better.  

The PGQMSA has long run targets. The program consists of inspection visits to investigate the 

application of the state of art techniques of production. The planning of the program requires 

a complete investigation of the state of the art of technology in all covered product lines. After 

the inspection, each firm receives a grade and this is used by project managers in the choice of 

companies  that  will  participate  of  their  vendor  list.  Though  some  suppliers  have  lost  their 

certification  after  implementation,  the  main  objective  of  the  program  is  to  increase  the 

compliance  of  state  of  the  art  norms  and  procedures  in  order  to  reduce  the  number  of 

unconformities in product delivery.  

The program has achieved its goal and the number of unconformities has radically decreased 

with  the  number  of  unconformities  of  PGQMSA  covered  products  per  US$  billion  of 

investment  approaching  zero  (see  Rocha  2015).  Moreover,  the  inspections  at  the  PGQMSA 

served as a consultancy for the companies. Most of them improved their processes during the 

program.  This  has  been  detected  by  Petrobras’  officials  in  their  yearly  inspections.  One 

example  of  the  type  of  impact  is  the  introduction  of  engineering  departments  in  valve 

producers in order to be able to calculate and store the signature of produced valves (Oliveira 

and Rocha 2008). 

Petrobras  has  also  a  program  for  the  development  of  new  suppliers  or  the  development  of 

new  products  by  existing  suppliers.  This  program  is  undertaken  by  the  procurement 

department of Petrobras but may have explicit involvement of internal R&D personnel and its 

intention  is  transference  of  knowledge  required  to  have  to  product  produced  under  the 

adequate  conditions.  The  development  of  new  products  together  with  suppliers  is  at  the 

center  of  Petrobras’  success  in  deep  waters.  One  striking  case  is  the  subsea  equipment  that 

made it possible for Petrobras to achieve its level of production.  

There  is  however  one  important  shortcoming  in  the  relationship  of  Petrobras  with  most 

suppliers  located  in  Brazil.  Very  rarely  knowledge  flows  go  in  both  ways  in  a  purposeful 

manner. Mostly Petrobras is directing knowledge to its domestic suppliers. This characteristic 

makes evident the problems associated with innovative capabilities in the domestic supplying 

industry.  Though  suppliers  were  very  likely  to  acknowledge  the  importance  of  Petrobras  as 

source  of  knowledge,  they  very  rarely  pointed  out  situations  where  they  contributed  to 

innovative  gains  by  Petrobras.  Some  exceptions  occurred  in  some  independent  engineering 

companies and in subsea equipment.  

In  recent  years,  multinational  oil  and  gas  service  and  equipment  supplies  companies  have 

established R&D labs in the Technological Park of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, 

where  the  main  Petrobras  R&D  lab,  CENPES,  is  also  located:  Schlumberger,  Baker-Hughes, 

Halliburton, FMC, Tenaris-Confab, Siemens, General Electrics, Vallourec and Georadar.4   

Rocha and Urraca Ruiz (2011) analyze the R&D internationalization strategies of three of these 

MNC, Schlumberger, Baker-Hughes, and FMC, using patent data and interviews to their CEOs 

in  Brazil  and  to  the  CENPES  CEO.  They  argue  that  three  main  features  have  attracted  these 

companies’ R&D investments to Brazil:  

(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

the size of the pre-salt oil and gas province,  

Petrobras’ accumulated capabilities and  

the existence of qualified personnel.  

Furthermore,  the Petrobras network has also impact on  cooperation. Fioravante  and Aguirre 

(2013) show that Petrobras’ suppliers are more likely to cooperate with universities and public 

research labs than a control sample. Rocha and Bueno (2008) show, using Brazilian Innovation 

Survey for 2003, that oil and gas suppliers have strong innovative behavior when compared to 

other  Manufacturing  and  Mining  companies  in  Brazil.  Nonetheless,  they  have  lower  R&D 

expenditures. They then explain  this  behavior due to the larger  cooperative relations oil and 

gas  suppliers  establish  with  their  clients  (Petrobras)  and  outside  industry  agents,  such  as 

universities. 

This  narrative  shows  that  Petrobras  has  a  procurement  policy  that  follows  most  of  the 

instruments or directions proposed by Edquist and Hommen (2000). They provide market for 

new products, allow  firms  to supply  products in international technological frontier, improve 

quality patterns and networking across different actors. The main shortcoming seems to be its 

relation  with  competitive  environments.  As  De  Negri  et  al.  (2011)  have  shown,  firms  that 

supply  to  Petrobras  become  less  likely  to  export.  This  is  confirmed  by  Rocha  (2011)  in  the

suppliers in their own operations.  

4.  DATABASE AND METHOD 

4.1.  THE DATABASE 

The  paper  uses  microdata  from  Reação  Annual  de  Informações  Sociais5  (RAIS)  for  the  years 

2009,  2010  and  2011.  RAIS  is  an  administrative  register  that  very  employer  has  to  file  every 

year in the Ministry of Labor. It contains social information on employees, such as number of 

months  in  workplace,  schooling,  occupation,  date  of  birth,  gender,  wage,  among  other 

variables.  Aggregating  this  information  per  firm  provides  accurate  information  on  the  firm 

level. After  aggregating, the whole  database contains 2.2 million firms,  in  2009, 2.4, in 2010, 

and 2.5, in 2011.  

In order to capture innovative effort, the paper uses a variable represented by the number of 

employees dedicated to scientific  and technical  activities (PoTec), selected  from the Brazilian 

Occupation  Classification,  according  to  criteria  elaborated  by  Araújo,  Cavalcante  and  Alves 

(2009).  PoTec  has  a  very  high  correlation  to  R&D  expenditures  as  declared  by  firms  to  the 

Brazilian Innovation Survey (from 0.8 to 0.9 depending on the year tested) and may therefore 

be used  as a  proxy  for technological  activities. In 2011,  RAIS  registered 573902  scientific and 

technical employees or 1.2% of total employees.  

Previous experience indicates that the attempt to obtain the vendor list of oil and gas supplies 

companies  may  conduct  to  frustration.  Therefore,  we  will  use  a  list  of  suppliers  through  the 

Organização  Nacional  da  Indústria  do  Petróleo  (ONIP),  which  is  an  independent  non-profit 

private organization that gathers companies that supply to oil and gas industry. It has cadastral 

information of the main players in the industry for the year 2007.  

In 2011, there were 1150 ONIP listed firms in RAIS, 522 were in mining and manufacturing, 126 

in  construction,  two  in  agriculture,  and  the  remaining  in  services.  Services  firms  were 

concentrated in division 74 of ISIC 3, that is, Other Business Activities (205). However, ONIP’s 

list does not by sure meet Petrobras’ vendor list. So, in order to control for mistake, the paper 

only  examines  firms  that  supply  critical  equipment  and  inputs,  that  is  that  belong  to  the 

following ISIC3 divisions: 11 - Extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas, 27 - Manufacture 

of  basic  metals,  28  -  Manufacture  of  fabricated  metal  products,  except  machinery  and

Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers, 35 - Manufacture of other transport equipment, 36 - 

Manufacture of furniture; manufacturing n.e.c. These sectors gathered 441 supply companies 

(according to 2011 RAIS), mostly small and medium sized (see Figure 1).

4.2.  THE METHOD 

One  important  issue  to  tackle  when  evaluating  governmental  innovative  policies  is  selection 

biases.  The  aim  of  government  support  for  innovative  activities  is  to  increase  innovative 

activities.  Therefore,  governmental  programs  should  not  fund  activities  that  would  happen 

anyway, but focus on activities that would not occur if governmental funding was not available 

(Wallsten  2000).  In  the  former  case,  governmental  support  would  be  substitute  for  private 

initiatives, while in the latter case it would be complementary. 

Selection biases  occur  first because governmental  officials  would be inclined to choose firms 

that they are sure would present results, and therefore focus would be directed to firms that 

are more likely to carry out innovative activities. A second type of selection bias would emerge 

from the behavior of innovative firms. In this  case, firms would look for the cheapest way to 

perform innovative activities. 

In  the  case  of  oil  and  gas  suppliers,  the  high  level  of  requirements  to  become  a  Petrobras 

supplier may result in similar problems and may have as a consequence biased results, that is, 

Petrobras suppliers may be better firms because Petrobras selects the best firms in the market 

and not because Petrobras has influence in their performance.  

This  kind  of  problem  is  tackled  in  Table  1  that  presents  descriptive  statistics  on  a  set  of 

selected  variables  for  the  universe  of  firms 

located 

in  critical  equipment  suppliers’ 

manufacturing sectors – number of employees (nemp), number of employees in scientific and 

technical  occupations  (potec),  the  potec  to  nemp  ratio  (inttec),  the  ratio  of  number  of 

employees with complete high school education to total employees (capacity), the ratio of the 

number of employees with superior education to total employees (sup) and wage in terms of 

the Brazilian minimum wage (wage). It seems clear that equipment suppliers are better firms.

Different  authors  have  given  different  answers  to  the  problem  of  selection  bias.  Wallsten 

(2000)  uses  a  three  stages  least  square  model  with  instrumental  variable  to  tackle  the 

endogeneity problem. Gelabert, Fosfuri and Tribó (2009) follows Wallsten (2000) in the use of 

instrumental  variables  and  adds  fixed  effects  panel  as  an  instrument  for  controlling  for  firm 

specific characteristics. Almus and Czarnitzki (2002) uses propensity score matching. Following 

Almus  and  Czarnitzki,  a  number  of  studies  have  introduced  propensity  score  matching  to 

control for selection biases (González and Pazó 2008, Goerg and Strobl 2007,  Czarnitzki, Hanel 

and Rosa 2011).  

This paper will adopt propensity score matching in order to compose a control sample and to 

deal with  for selection  biases. After composing the control sample,  we will run two  different 

models, in a pooled data sample: (i) ordinary least squares and (ii) a tobit model. In this case, 

we expect to deal with the question whether oil and gas suppliers, submitted to procurement 

policy, outperform their counterpart.  

In order to build a control model, we run a propensity score model that takes into account a 

number  of  firm  characteristics.  The  probit  pooled  model  has  as  dependent  variable 

technological intensity, a dummy variable that assumes value 1 (one) if the firm is an oil and 

gas supplier and 0 (zero), otherwise,  and as independent variables, the concentration level of 

the  three  digit  sector  where  the  firm  is  classified,  represented  by  the  Hirschman-Herfindhal 

index  (hhi),  the  firm’s  wage  level  (wage),  the  proportion  of  employees  with  complete 

secondary  education  (capacity),  the  average  number  of  years  of  the  employees  in  the  firm 

(experience), seven size dummies that account for the size level6, and sectoral dummies for the 

two  digit  secotrs  (see  equation  1).    The  results  are  reported  in  0.  Most  importanty,  Table  3 

shows  that  differences  between  treated  and  untreated  samples  with  respect  to  size,  sector 

and  the  other  variables  are  insignificant  and,  thus,  the  following  analysis  will  deal  with  firms 

that had similar probabilities of being treated.

6  The  use  of  size  dummies  is  justified  by  the  avoidance  of  testing  a  quadratic  relation  between  the 
dependent  variable  (intec=potec/nemp)  and  the  independent  variable  that  would  represent  size 
(nemp).

After defining the control sample, we’ll test the following equation: 

݅݊ݐݐ݁ܿ =

ܿ݋݊ݏݐܽ݊ݐ + ߙ௜ݏ݅ݖ݁݀ݑ݉݉݅݁ݏ௜ + ߚଵ݌݁ݐݎ݋ + ߚଶܪܪܫ + ߚଷܿܽ݌ܽܿ݅ݐݕ + ߚସ݁ݔ݌݁ݎ݅݁݊ܿ݁ +

ߛ௝ݏ݁ܿݐ݋ݎ݈ܽ݀ݑ݉݉݅݁ݏ     (Equation 2) 

We’ll report the results for the OLS model in pooled data and panel data random effects model 

and for tobit model, also in pooled data and panel data random effects model. The use of tobit 

model  is  justified  due  to  the  censured  dependent  variable  in  zero  and  one.  Equation  (2) 

departs  from  the  basic  Schumpeterian  model,  relating  innovation  efforts  to  firm  size  and 

market concentration. The use of sectoral dummies is justified to control for opportunity and 

appropriability  characteristics.  Firm  characteristics  are  also  accounted  for  in  experience  and 

capacity variables. Petro is the policy variable to be tested.   

 

5.  RESULTS 

Table  4  shows  the  four  regression  equations.  The  first  model  presents  an  OLS  pooled  data 

regression; the second, a panel data random effects regression; the third, a tobit pooled data 

regression;  and  the  fourth  model,  a  random  effects  tobit  panel  data  regression.  In  all  four 

equations,  the  respective  F  and  Wald  test  present  adequate  values.  In  both  random  effects, 

Breusch-Pagan  test  rejects  the  null  hypothesis  and  suggest  for  the  suitable  use  of  random 

effects.   

The results of all four equations confirm both Schumpeterian hypotheses. On the one hand, all 

size  dummies,  from  ten  employees  on,  present  positive  and  significant  coefficients.  The 

coefficient becomes larger as size increases suggesting larger firms dispend  greater  efforts in 

technological activities. On the other hand, concentration has a positive and significant effect 

on  technology  intensity.  The  higher  the  three-digit  market  concentration  is,  the  higher  the 

technological  efforts.  Experience  and  capacity  have  the  expected  sign  and 

improve 

technological efforts.  Most sectoral dummies are significant with higher effects in instruments 

(33), electrical equipment (32) and oil and gas extraction (11).  

The  petro  dummy  has  the  expected  sign.  Relation  with  oil  and  gas  procurement  policy  has 

positive effect on technological effort, always significant at the 1% level. The dimension of the 

effect varies from 0.9 percentage point, in the OLS model up to 2.5% percentage points in the 

random  effects  tobit  panel  data  model.  In  the  case  of  both  tobit  models  the  effect  is 

substantial,  suggesting  that  oil  and  gas  procurement  policy  has  been  quite  effective.  The 

analysis of the four models and the adequacy of the tobit model to the situation, suggests that 

the  impact  should  be  closer  to  2%.  This  impact  is  far  from  small.  It  more  than  doubles  the 

technological  efforts  in  relation  to  similar  firms  in  size,  capacity,  experience,  markets  and 

sectors.  

The  results  point  to  a  great  influence  of  Petrobras’  procurement  on  firm  behavior.  This 

influence had been assessed  before with respect to  firm growth  and exports (De Negri et al. 

2011)  with  mixed  results.  This  analysis  adds  important  feature  to  it  because  it  shows  that 

technological activities are also affected.

However, the result also  throws some doubts on  the way  innovation policy has  been  carried 

out  in  Brazil.  Though  Petrobras  has  been  able  to  develop  a  thick  and  high  performance 

networks  of  firms,  universities  and  research  labs,  the  results  seem  to  be  much  more  a 

consequence of the company’s initiative than a result of governmental policy. As Rocha (2015) 

argues, only very recently resources from the supply side have been channeled towards the oil 

and gas equipment supplies firms. From the great amount of public resources directed to R&D 

and S&T  activities in the oil and  gas  sector,  very  little has  been  focused on suppliers.  Money 

has mostly been directed towards CENPES (the Petrobras R&D lab) and universities and non-

profit research facilities.  A greater  connection between  demand and supply instruments may 

be called for and seems to be an important challenge to pursue. 

Most  importantly,  in  a  scenario  where  Petrobras,  national  content  policy  and  state-owned 

companies are under great attack, this result points to important spillovers of the presence of 

Petrobras and the role of policy guided measures carried out by the company. 

 

6.  CONCLUSIONS 

This paper aimed to assess the impact on firms of the simultaneous application of a national 

content clause in the oil and gas sector and the procurement policy carried out by Petrobras. 

Using data from RAIS, the paper carried out this task by comparing the ratio of scientific and 

technical personnel to total number of employees of oil and gas equipment supplies firms and 

a  control  sample  built  through  propensity  score  matching.  The  results  suggest  that  being  a 

supplier to the sector improves firm’s technological intensity.  

Recent literature on innovation policy has argued that procurement policies that explore more 

interactions across agents are an important policy option. They pose that supply based policies 

are based on a market imperfection view of innovation while procurement policies explore the 

interactive  character  of  innovative  activities  and,  together  with  demand  instruments,  may 

provide better results. This paper presents support to their cause.
