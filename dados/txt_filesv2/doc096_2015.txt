Abstract: Since the 1990s, developing countries growth rates have been increasing whereas developed 
countries  growth  rates  have  been  decreasing.  Because  countries  have  different  demand  structures 
(according to their income level), the demand for some products were boosted over others, and hence 
countries  exporting  such  demand  growing  products  tended  to  be  positively  affected.  Based  on  a 
Kaldorian approach, in which exports’ dynamics play a crucial role to understanding the difference in 
growth rates across countries, countries’ growth rates is explained taking into account non-homogeneous 
growth across different groups of countries. This work renders these changes in the structure of world 
demand  as  endogenous  in  a  balance-of-payments  growth  (BPCG)  model.  The  results  suggest  that 
natural-resource  exporters’  higher  growth  rates  in  the  last  decade  were  caused  by  a  faster  growth  of 
developing countries demand for natural resources. Nevertheless, when other developing economies are 
considered, the outcomes show that an increase of growth rates based on natural-resource exports might 
be unsustainable in the long run, once the income elasticities of demand for imports and for exports are 
higher for more technological advanced sectors.

Resumo: Desde os anos 1990, as taxas de crescimento dos países em desenvolvimento têm aumentado 
enquanto que a dos países desenvolvidos têm diminuído. Como os países têm diferentes estruturas de 
demanda  (de  acordo  com  seu  nível  de  renda),  a  demanda  por  alguns  produtos  foi  impulsionada 
relativamente  a  de  outros  e,  portanto,  os  países  exportadores  tal  demanda  crescente  foram  afetados 
positivamente.  Com  base  em  uma  abordagem  Kaldoriana,  em  que  as  exportações  desempenham  um 
papel  crucial  para  a  compreensão  da  diferença  nas  taxas  de  crescimento,  este  trabalho  explica  o 
crescimento  dos  países  considerando  o  crescimento  não-homogêneo  dos  parceiros  comerciais.  Para 
tanto,  o  impacto  das  mudanças  da  estrutura  da  demanda  mundial  é  endogeneizado  no  modelo  de 
crescimento restrito pelo balanço-de-pagamentos. Os resultados sugerem que as taxas de crescimento 
mais  elevadas  dos  exportadores  de  recursos  naturais  na  última  década  foram  causados  por  um 
crescimento mais rápido de países em desenvolvimento, que gerou um aumento relativo da demanda por 
esses  recursos.  No  entanto,  quando  outras  economias  em  desenvolvimento  são  consideradas,  os 
resultados  mostram  que  um  aumento  das  taxas  de  crescimento  baseado  em  exportações  de  recursos 
naturais  pode  ser  insustentável  no  longo  prazo,  uma  vez  que  as  elasticidades-renda  da  demanda  por 
importações e por exportações são maiores para mais setores tecnológicos avançados.

1.  Introduction 

The world’s structure of production has deeply changed in terms of localisation since the 1990s. 
Although the worldwide annual growth rate fell from 4.1% between 1960 and 1990 to 2.7% from then 
on,  this  change  differs  significantly  when  high-income  countries  are  compared  to  low  and  middle-
income  countries.  According  to  the  WB-WDI,  the  annual  growth  rate  in  the  group  of  high-income 
countries fell from 4.1% to 2.1%, while low and middle-income countries experienced an increase in 
their annual growth rates from 4.5% to 5.0% over the same period. Considering the 2000s alone, the 
differences are even greater: the annual growth rate in the high income countries dropped to 1.6%, while 
that among low and middle-income countries rose to 6.0%, as can be seen in Table 1:

Thereby,  since  the  1990s,  developing  countries  growth  rates  have  been  increasing  whereas 
developed  countries  growth  rates  have  been  decreasing.  Because  countries  have  different  demand 
structures (according to their income level), the faster growth of developing countries has promoted a 
structural  change in  world  demand as a whole.  As the demand for some products  were boosted  over 
others, countries exporting such demand growing products tended to be positively affected. One could 
expect, for example, that an acceleration of the Chinese growth relatively to the US will stimulate the 
demand for minerals and food over the demand for electronic appliances. Hence, countries that export 
minerals and food predominantly are benefited, whilst those exporting electronics might face a negative 
impact. In sum, the dynamics of a country exports essentially depends on its sectoral structure together 
with the difference among trading partners growth rates. 

Based on a Kaldorian approach, in which exports’ dynamics play a crucial role to understanding 
the difference in growth rates across countries, this work wishes to explain countries’ growth rates taking 
into account that non-homogeneous growth across different groups of countries has been an important 
issue since the 1990s, such as discussed before. The aim of the work is to render these changes in the 
structure of world demand as endogenous in a balance-of-payments growth (BPCG) model. This model 
explains countries’ growth rates through income elasticities of demand for imports and exports, and thus 
taking into account different income elasticities according to commercial partners is a possible source 
of explanation for the impact of these structural changes. 

According  to  the  BPCG  model,  economic  growth  is  constrained  by  countries’  capability  to 
import, and its long-term growth rate is given by the ratio between the growth of exports and the elasticity 
of  imports  (Thirlwall,  1979;  McCombie  and  Thirlwall,  1994).  Further  on,  more  complex  versions  of 
Thirlwall’s  model  have  objected  to  provide  more  precise  interpretations  on  this  phenomenon  by 
analysing countries’ growth from various perspectives and by incorporating other factors such as capital 
influx and interest payments. Two direct extensions of Thirlwall’s model developed in the 2000s are 
specifically related to the model developed in this work. First, based on the theoretical model developed 
by McCombie (1993), Nell (2003) presents a multilateral BPCG model to explain how trading partners 
can affect the exports of a country. Moreover, Araujo and Lima (2007) develops a multisectoral version 
of this model in  order to explain how changes in  the sectoral structure of exports and imports  affect 
countries’ long-term growth rates. However, these models are not able to take account of the impacts of 
structural changes in the world demand on countries’ long-term growth rates.

With the aim of rendering the impacts of (structural) changes in world demand as endogenous, 
this  work  develops  a  version  of  the  BPCG  model  that  is  both  multisectoral  and  multilateral.  This 
approach  is  capable  of  considering  the  difference  among  trade  partners’  growth  rates  on  countries’ 
exports. Being multilateral, the model regards the effect of different growth rates among countries in 
different stages of development. Moreover, a multisectoral model is needed because, once these partners 
are growing at different paces, it affects the sectoral structure of the world demand and, consequently, 
the sectoral structure of countries’ exports. 

After presenting the model theoretically, it is applied to Latin American and Asian economies. 
This  empirical  analysis  enables  us  to  compare  the  recent  growth  pattern  of  two  distinct  groups  of 
countries:  one  that  is  mainly  a  natural-resource  exporter  (Latin  America)  and  the  other  that  exports 
manufactured goods mostly (Asia). This purpose of this investigation is to discusses whether the impact 
of these changes in world demand have had structural and permanent effects on countries’ growth rates 
or, alternatively, whether they are only conjectural and not sustainable in the long-run. Latin-American 
countries’ growth in the 2000s was directly related to the growth in the demand for natural resources. 
The acceleration of the developing countries’ growth rates, particularly in Asia, has increased the world 
demand for food and minerals, which has relaxed the balance-of-payment constraints of natural-resource 
exporters. As a result, one of the most important restrictions on South American economic growth in the 
last two decades may have been significantly reduced. From this perspective, the model developed here 
considers the impact of a faster growth of developing economies on countries’ exports to explain why 
natural  resource  exporters have been lately achieving higher  growth  rates. Furthermore, the model  is 
also used to evaluate the sustainability of these higher growth rates in the long run. 

This work is divided into five sections. After this introduction, Section 2 presents the first BPCG 
model  developed  by  Thirlwall  (1979)  and  some  extensions  related  to  this  work.  The  third  section 
discusses why these models are not able to explain completely the impacts of such worldwide structural 
changes and an extension to BPCG models is presented with the aim of rendering the impact of these 
changes in world demand as endogenous. In the fourth section, the model is applied to Brazilian data in 
order  to  investigate  the  impact  of  that  structural  change  on  its  long-term  growth,  as  well  as  to  other 
developing  economies  with  the  aim  of  comparing  the  results.  Finally,  the  last  section  discusses  the 
importance of the model to explain the differences on countries’ growth rates, as well as its limitations. 

 

2.  Thirlwall’s model and some extensions 

From  a  Post-Keynesian  perspective  the  growth  rate  of  a  given  region  is  demand-driven.  This 
point of view, which will be considered along this work, implies that differences of  growth  between 
countries are not explained by the supply factors, such as in neoclassical and new growth models, but 
they are mainly explained by the sources of demand. Essentially, in  the case of open economies, the 
primary autonomous source of demand is external demand. Exports increase the income growth through 
their multiplier effects on the other sources of demand. Furthermore, as exports are the only component 
of aggregate demand able to generate foreign currency, they allow the growth of other sources of demand 
without generating balance-of-payments constraint.  

Thirlwall (1979) developed the first balance-of-payments constrained growth (BPCG) model. In 
his  paper,  he  argues  that  the  differences  between  countries’  growth  rates  are  better  explained  by  the 
Keynesian approach, which stresses the constraints on demand, than the neoclassical approach, which is 
based on supply factors (Thirlwall, 1979; McCombie and Thirlwall, 2004). He also argues that in the 
case  of  open  economies,  the  balance-of-payments  is  the  dominant  constraint  on  demand  growth. 
Therefore,  a  country’s  long-term  growth  rate  (where  the  balance-of-payments  equilibrium  must  be 
maintained) is given by its ability to increase the growth of exports and reduce the growth of imports. 
The Thirlwall’s model was constructed as follow: 

The balance-of-payments equilibrium on current account can be expressed as: 
 

𝑃𝑑𝑡𝑋𝑡 = 𝑃𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑡𝐸𝑡     (1), 

 

 

 

3 

where X and M are the exports and imports, respectively (both in constant prices), Pd is the export prices 
in domestic currency, Pf is the import prices in foreign currency, E is the exchange rate, and the subscript 
t is time. 

Aiming  to  work  with  growth  rates  instead  of  absolute  values  this  expression  is  written  in  its 

linearized version: 

 

 

𝑝𝑑𝑡 + 𝑥𝑡 = 𝑝𝑓𝑡 + 𝑚𝑡 + 𝑒𝑡     (2), 

where lower-case letters represent rate of changes. 

Taking  the  standard  demand  theory,  imports  are  expressed  as  a  multiplicative  function  of  the 
price of imports in domestic prices, the price of import substitutes and the level of domestic income. 
This expression can be linearized as: 

 

 

𝑚𝑡 = 𝜓(𝑝𝑓𝑡 + 𝑒𝑡) + 𝜙𝑝𝑑𝑡 + 𝜋𝑦𝑡     (3), 

where ψ is the price-elasticity of imports, ϕ is the cross-elasticity of imports, π is the income elasticity 
of imports, and y is the domestic income growth. 

Exports can also be expressed as a multiplicative function. Its arguments are the price of demand 
for exports in foreign prices, the price of goods competitive with exports and the level of world income. 
A linearized version of this expression is: 

 

 

𝑥𝑡 = 𝜂(𝑝𝑑𝑡 + 𝑒𝑡) + 𝛿𝑝𝑓𝑡 + 𝜀𝑧𝑡     (4), 

where η is the price-elasticity of exports, δ is the cross-elasticity of exports, ε is the income elasticity of 
exports, and y is the world income growth. 

Substituting  equations  (3)  and  (4)  into  (2),  and  solving  for  yt,  the  balance-of-payments 

constrained growth rate can be expressed as follow: 

 

𝑦𝐵𝑡 =

𝑝𝑑𝑡(1+𝜂−𝜙)−𝑝𝑓𝑡(1−𝛿+𝜓)+𝜀(𝑧𝑡) 

     (5). 

𝜋

 
Finally, assuming that the own price-elasticities of imports and exports are equal to the cross-
elasticities, as well as that the relative prices measured in a common currency do not change in the long-
run, the BPCG rate can be expressed as: 

 

𝑦𝐵𝑡 =

𝜀 

𝜋

𝑧𝑡     (6). 

 
This  equation  shows  that  the  BPCG  rate  of  a  country  is  given  by  the  ratio  of  the  income 
elasticities of demand for exports and imports multiplied by the rate of growth of world income. This 
equation is widely known as Thirlwall’s law. In his paper, the author applied this equation to a group of 
several developed countries. Although his econometric method was subsequently contested (McCombie, 
1997), the author’s results showed that this law is able to explain a significant amount of the growth in 
the analysed countries. 

After  Thirlwall’s  inaugural  article,  some  new  models  were  developed  based  on  his  approach. 
While  Thirlwall’s  model  has  been  able  to  explain  the  differences  in  growth  rates  among  developed 
countries,  some  extensions  were  made  to  explain  different  factors  that  may  affect  countries’  growth 
rates. Thirlwall and Hussain (1982), for example, extended the model to apply it to developing countries. 
According to the authors “it must be recognized, though, that developing countries are often able to build 
up ever-growing current account deficits financed by capital inflows”. Thus, Thirlwall’s equation was 
modified to allow for capital flows. The modified model was applied to a group of developing countries, 

 

 

4 

and  capital  flows  were  shown  to  be  relevant  in  explaining  some  of  their  growth  rates,  e.g.,  Brazil, 
Tunisia, Pakistan and India. 

Two direct extensions of Thirlwall’s model developed in the 2000s are specifically related to the 
proposed model that is developed here. First, based on the theoretical model developed by McCombie 
(1993),  Nell  (2003)  applied  the  BPCG  models  to  neighbouring  regions.  Although  his  model  may  be 
criticised, since it considers that a country should have balance-of-payments equilibrium with all trading 
partners, it provides relevant insights in terms of the importance of considering countries’ multilateral 
relations. The author considered the original model as a specific case where one country has relations 
with “the rest of the world”. Then, he developed a “generalised” version of this model where a country 
may  have  multilateral  trade  relations.  He  showed  that  trading  partners  might  affect  the  exports  of  a 
country differently. According to him, “the main finding of the paper is that the policy implications of 
the ‘generalised’ BOP growth model present a different perspective compared with the ‘specific’ BOP 
model”. 

In Nell’s model, the long-term growth rate of a country is explained by the ratio of the weighted 
average of exports for each trading partner to the weighted average of income elasticities for imports 
from each trading partner. Although he has propounded the model for two partners, it may be generalised 
for K partners: 

 

𝑎 =

𝑗=1
𝐾
𝑗=1

∑

𝑗

𝑗𝛾𝑡
𝑗𝜀𝑖
𝑦𝑡

     (7), 

where K is the number of trading partners and the index j is the each partner (country or region), the 
index a is the home country, 𝛾 is the share of exports to each partner as a percentage of total country’s 
exports, and 𝜙 is the share of imports from each partner as a percentage of total country’s imports. 

Araujo and Lima (2007) proposed the other recent study related to the model developed in this 
work.  The  authors  extended  Thirlwall’s  original  model  to  explain  the  importance  of  changes  in  the 
sectoral structure of exports and imports on the long-run growth rate of a country. They used Pasinetti’s 
structural economics dynamic (SED) approach to derive a multisectoral version of Thirlwall’s law. In 
Araujo and Lima’s model, the growth rate of a country is directly proportional to the sectoral income 
elasticities of demand for exports and imports weighted by coefficients that measure the share of each 
sector in total exports and imports. According to the authors, the main implication of this extension is 
that “changes in composition of demand or in the structure of production (…) also matter for economic 
growth”. The multisectoral version of BPCG model can be expressed as follow3: 

 

 

𝑦𝐵𝑡 =

     (8), 

where  N is  the number of sectors and the index i is  each sector, 𝜀 and 𝜋 are the income elasticity of 
demand for exports and imports of each sector, respectively, 𝛾 is the share of exports of each sector, and 
𝜙 is the share of imports of each sector. 

 

3.  Incorporating world structural changes into BPCG models  

Although  the  models  developed  by  Nell  (2003)  and  Araujo  and  Lima  (2007)  are  relevant  in 
explaining certain issues related to the differences in countries’ growth rates, they have to be extended 
to evaluate the impacts of non-homogeneous growth across countries on the structure of world imports. 
These models do not consider the impacts of structural changes in world demand to be endogenous. On 
the  one  hand,  the  multisectoral  version  of  the  BPCG  model  (Araujo  and  Lima,  2007)  assumes  that 
elasticities are only affected by changes in the composition of imports and exports, and thus differences 

                                                 
3  Although  the  multisectoral  version  of  BPCG  was  developed  by  Araujo  and  Lima  (2007),  this  expression  is  based  on 
Setterfield’s (2011) version of their model 

5 

 

 

in  growth  rates  between  a  country’s  trading  partners  do  not  affect  growth.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
multilateral  BPCG model (Nell, 2003) do not  consider the effect  of non-homogeneous  growth  in  the 
world  economy  on  the  sectoral  structure  of  world  demand.  The  latter  model  considers  the  impact  of 
different growth rates across trading partners, but not from a sectoral perspective. However, a relevant 
consequence of different growth across trading partners is that they affect the sectoral composition of 
world demand, and thus the sectoral income elasticities of demand. As argued by Pasinetti (1981) and 
Cornwall  (1977),  income  grow  affects  demand  because  consumers  move  through  a  ‘commodity 
hierarchy’ in which different goods have different income elasticities of demand in different levels of 
income.  

Thereby, non-homogeneous growth across trading partners according to their income levels may 
directly affect a country’s growth rate, once it affects the world’s import structure (according to their 
income elasticities for imports) and thus this country’s exports. Consequently, a country’s export growth 
rate  (and  thus  the  balance-of-payment  constrained  growth  rate)  depends  on  the  sectoral  structure  of 
exports,  as  suggested  by  Araujo  and  Lima  (2007),  but  it  also  depends  on  the  difference  between  the 
growth rates of its trading partners. Hence, a new model has to be developed and studied in depth to 
understand the impact of global structural changes in the 2000s on countries’ long-term growth rates. 
The multisectoral Thirlwall’s law has to be extended to a model that considers the impact of different 
growing trajectories across trading partners on countries’ exports, and thus on their balance-of-payments 
constraints. 

Thereby,  to  model  structural  changes  in  world  demand  and  their  impact  on  exports  as 
endogenous,  the  two  extensions  of  Thirlwall’s  model  previously  described  will  be  combined  in  the 
construction of this new model. Both the multisectoral model (Araujo and Lima, 2007) and multilateral 
model  (Nell,  2003)  will  be  considered  together  with  the  aim  of  investigating  the  impact  of  different 
growth rates of trading partners on countries’ sectoral structure of exports and thus on their growth rates. 
In this new model, the income elasticity of demand for exports is divided into the income elasticities of 
demand  for  exports  across  sectors  and  trading  partners.  The  export  growth  is  given  by  the  weighted 
income elasticities multiplied by the growth rate of each trading partner. This division enables the model 
to distinguish the impacts of the growth rates of different trading partners on a country’s BPCG. 

Let’s start by considering 2 goods and 3 countries: 
- Goods: (1) primary, and (2) secondary 
- Countries: (a) home country, (d) developed, and (u) underdeveloped 

 

The total imports of the country a can be written as: 

 

 

𝑀𝑎𝑡 =   𝑀𝑎𝑡

1d +   𝑀𝑎𝑡

2𝑑 +   𝑀𝑎𝑡

1𝑢 +   𝑀𝑎𝑡

𝑖𝑗
2𝑢 =   ∑ ∑ 𝑀𝑎𝑡

2
𝑖=1

𝑗=𝑖

     (9), 

where M is the imports of the home country (in the subscript) from its trading partner (in the superscript). 
The indices i, j and t represent the goods, the trading partners and each period of time, respectively. 

Taking the standard demand theory, the import demand function of the home country is given as 

follow4:

     (10), 

𝑖𝑗 ≡ (

𝑃𝑗𝑡

where P is the price of i in the country in the subscript (a or j), E is the exchange rate between a and j, 
𝜓 is the price-elasticity of demand for imports, and 𝜋 is the income elasticity of demand for imports. 

Considering that relative prices measured in domestic currency do not change over time, country 

a’s import growth rate of each good i from each country j can be written as: 

                                                 
4 For simplicity, price-elasticities of substitution between goods is not taken into account. Although  it is not negligible, prices 
do not play any role in Thirlwall’s model in the long run, and thus it does not change the results.

Note  that  imports  growth  of  the  countries  d  and  u  from  the  country  a  are  equal  to  the  export 
growth of a to d and u, respectively. Thus, the export growth of the domestic country can be written as 
the weighted average of the imports of the d and u from a:

Furthermore, if we consider the income elasticity of demand for imports (𝜋 ) of each country to 
be independent from the country that they come from, which is reasonable as the aim of this work is to 
analyse the impacts of structural changes in world demand on countries’ exports, a simplified model is 
given by:

Equation (21) shows explicitly how the non-homogeneous growth rates among trading partners 

affect the home country’s long-term growth. 

Thus, we have that the long-term growth rate (given by the BPCG rate) depends on the country’s 
structure of imports and exports, as suggested by Araujo and Lima’s model, but it also depends on the 
difference in growth rate among trading partners. In their multisectoral model, a country may achieve a 
higher growth rate by increasing exports of sectors with high income-elasticities or by reducing their 
imports.  In  the  model  developed  here,  a  country  may  also  grow  faster  due  to  an  increase  in  trading 
partners’ growth rates. This second engine takes place when the partners that are experiencing the faster 
growth demand relatively more of the goods exported by the home country, resulting in a higher BPCG 
rate. Therefore, based on the model developed here, it is possible to evaluate whether, during the 2000s, 
the  faster  growth  of  developing  countries  (relatively  to  developed  countries)  had  structural  and 
permanent impacts on the growth rate of natural resources exporters. 

 

4.  Data, econometric method and empirical results 

The aim of this section is to estimate the model presented in the last section using developing 
countries  data  and  to  compare  the  results  with  those  obtained  by  some  empirical  application  of 
multisectoral  models,  such  as  in  Gouvea  and  Lima  (2010).  However,  before  doing  so,  some  initial 
explanations in terms of methods and data are presented in the following subsection. 

 

4.1. Data and sectoral classification 

Once it was assumed that the main source of changes in world demand comes from differences 
in growth rates among countries with diverse income levels, this section divides the trading partners of 
each country under consideration into “high income level countries” (HIC) and “low and middle income 
level countries” (LIC)6. Although this division is a generalisation of a more complex process, it makes 
the model capable of considering the above mentioned structural changes in world demand. 

Regarding the sectoral division, two approaches are employed. 
Firstly, the Broad Economic Categories (BEC) classification is used to analyse the elasticities 
according to categories of demand. According to this classification, sectors of the Standard International 
Trade  Classification  (SITC),  Rev.  1  are  grouped  into:  large  economic  classes  of  commodities, 
distinguishing  foods,  industrial  supplies,  capital  equipment,  consumer  durables  and  consumer  non-
durables.  As  a  matter  of  simplification,  the  following  analysis  aggregates  these  sectors  in  only  three 
groups: (1) Natural Resources (NR) – commodities, distinguishing foods and industrial suppliers; (2) 
Consumption  Goods  (CG)  –  consumer  durables  and  consumer  non-durables  goods;  and  (3)  Capital 
Goods (KG) – capital and transport equipment (including parts and accessories).

Secondly, exports and imports are grouped into Primary Products (PR), Low-tech manufacturing 
(LT)  and  High-tech  manufacturing  (HT).  This  classification  is  based  on  the  UNIDO  (2013:205) 
classification for manufacturing activities (LT and HT), and PR encloses agriculture and mining.7  

The analysis employed in this paper takes the largest economies of South American and South 
and East Asian countries. The South American countries are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru 
and  Venezuela.  The  South  and  East  Asian  countries  are  Hong  Kong,  India,  Korea,  Malaysia,  The 
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand8. China and  Indonesia were excluded from  the analysis because 
data are not available for the initial years. The source used for exports and imports data is the United 
Nations Commodity Trade Statistics (COMTRADE) database. These data (in SITC, Rev. 1) are available 
for several countries until 2014 but the initial  year may differ among them. Hence, data before 1965 
were not considered in this analysis. Furthermore, to avoid the impacts of the late 2000s international 
crisis, the income elasticities of demand are estimated using data until 2007. 

Data in the COMTRADE database are available in U.S. dollars at current prices. Although other 
estimates  of  multisectoral  Thirlwall’s  law  did  not  take  into  account  change  in  relative  prices  across 
sectors9,  this  procedure  is  necessary  here  because  the  functions  of  exports  and  imports  in  the  model 
consider growth rates in constant prices, so that changes in relative prices could bias its results. Exports 
and imports of consumption goods and low-tech manufacturing were deflated using the price index of 
household  consumption,  whilst  the  price  index  of  capital  formation  was  used  to  deflate  imports  and 
exports  of  capital  goods  and  high-tech  manufacturing.  Both  indices  are  available  in  the  Penn  World 
Table (Feenstra et al., 2013). Imports were deflated using each country’s price indices, and exports were 
deflated using the US price indices10. Further, data on the exports and imports of natural resources and 
primary products were deflated using the free market commodity price indices, available in the UNCTAD 
Statistic Database (UNCTAD-Stat). 11 

Additionally,  to  obtain  countries’  and  regions’  GDP  growth  rates,  the  World  Development 
Indicators (World Bank) is used. All series in this database may be used without further modifications 
once they are available from 1960 to 2011 in U.S. dollars at constant prices for all countries. 

It is also important to note that although changes in exchange rates are not relevant to explaining 
the growth rates of trade flows in this model, it is desirable to use changes in real exchange rates while 
estimating  income  elasticities  (McCombie,  1997).  In  order  to  do  so,  data  from  1950  to  2010  for 
countries’ GDP price indices are used. These data are available in the Penn World Table (Feenstra et al., 
2013). 

Thereby, equations (22) and (23) are estimated to obtain the income elasticities of demand for 

imports and exports, respectively: 

 

𝑙𝑛(𝑀𝑎𝑖

𝑖 ) = 𝜋𝑎𝑖

𝑖 𝑙𝑛(𝑌𝑎𝑡) +   𝜓𝑎𝑡𝑙𝑛(𝑅𝐸𝑅𝑎𝑡)     (22), and 

 

𝑙𝑛(𝑋𝑎𝑖

𝑖𝑗) = 𝜀𝑎𝑖

𝑖𝑗𝑙𝑛(𝑌𝑗𝑡) +   𝜂𝑎𝑡𝑙𝑛(𝑅𝐸𝑅𝑎𝑡)     (23), 

 

where η is the price-elasticity of demand for exports, X is the exports from country a to country j, and 
RER is country a’s real exchange rate to the U.S. . As the index i stands for sectors, and j stands for LIC 
and HIC, there will be nine specifications for each country under consideration: three of them coming 
from equation (2) and six of them coming from equation (23). 

                                                 
7 Appendix A presents the classification employed in this analysis. 
8 Because the  method employed in this  work demands strongly balanced panels and some countries do not have data for 
specific  years,  some  adjustments  were  made  in  the  database  before  conducting  the  estimations:  Indian  imports  in  1982, 
Peruvian exports and imports in 1981, Thai exports in 1988 and Venezuelan exports in 2007 were obtained by averaging 
previous and next years (in log). 
9Gouvea and Lima (2010), Romero, Silveira and Jayme Jr. (2011) and Tharnpanich and McCombie (2013) applied aggregate 
deflators as price deflators for sub-sectors in their classification are not available. 
10 The choice of the US price indices relies on the assumption that their import prices are a reference to all other countries’ 
export prices.

4.2. Applying the model to Brazil 

As discussed in McCombie (1997), some series used in this model might have been generated by 
a non-stationary process, so that an estimation of these equations by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) could 
be  spurious.  Therefore,  the  Augmented  Dickey-Fuller  (ADF)  and  the  Phillips-Perron  (PP)  tests  were 
used  to  investigate  the  presence  of  unit  roots,  and  for  the  non-stationary  variables,  a  Johansen’s  co-
integration test was also conducted. 

According  to  the  tests  results,  two  different  strategies  were  employed  in  order  to  estimate  the 
elasticities of interest12. First, for the variables (log-linearized) that proved themselves to be stationary, 
a  basic  OLS  regression  is  applied.  Then,  in  the  cases  where  the  unit  root  tests  have  indicated  non-
stationary variables, but  the series are likely to  co-integrate according to  the Johansen test, an Error-
Correction Mechanism (ECM) is estimated13. 

For the case in which the series are non-stationary and do not co-integrate, some authors suggest 
the  estimation  of  elasticities  through  the  OLS  method  in  first  differences.  However,  according  to 
McCombie (1997), this method is not useful because long-term relationship between variables is lost. 
Nevertheless,  according  to  Johansen’s  test,  all  non-stationary  variables  proved  to  be  co-integrated, 
showing  that  there  is  a  long-term  relationship  between  income  growth  and  imports  and  exports,  as 
expected.  

Looking carefully into the estimated income elasticities of exports for Brazil (first two columns 
of Table 2) we see that the coefficients associated with capital and consumption goods are greater than 
the  ones  for  natural  resources  regarding  both  groups  of  trading  partners  (LIC  and  HIC).  This  result 
suggests that for both groups of partners a more rapid growth accentuates more significantly the demand 
for non-resource based products. On the other hand, the difference between the two groups of countries 
demonstrates that they have different demand structures in their trade relationship with Brazil. Although 
a marginal increase in the LIC’s growth rate stimulates the demand for natural resources and capital and 
consumption goods similarly  (the difference between the elasticities is  not  statistically significant), a 
marginal  increase  in  the  HIC’s  growth  rate  stimulates  these  demands  differently:  capital  and 
consumption goods grow significantly faster than natural resources (at the 1% level). 

Furthermore, the last column of Table 2 shows that, for both consumption and capital goods, the 
Brazilian income elasticity of demand for exports to HIC is significantly higher than to LIC, whilst, for 
natural resources, it is significantly higher to LIC than to HIC.

Regarding NR exports, we have that if HIC’s growth rate increases by 1 p.p., Brazilian NR exports 
would increase by only 1.36%, but, if LIC’s growth rate increases by 1 p.p., Brazilian NR exports would 
increase by 2.19%. Thereby, once Brazil is predominantly an exporter of NR products, we shall conclude 
that the faster growth of LIC during the 2000s have significantly contributed to its total exports growth, 
and consequently to reducing the balance-of-payments constraints. 

Taking the higher  growth rate of  LIC as permanent,  and considering that this phenomena has 
resulted in an structural change in the world demand in favour of natural resources, it is now investigated 
whether the increase in the Brazilian growth rate during the 2000s is conjectural or due to this change in 
world demand and, consequently, in Brazil’s balance-of-payments dynamics. 

Notice that it is now possible to input these estimated income elasticities for Brazil into equation 
4.10  in  order  to  obtain  Brazil’s  BPCG  rate  annually  and  its  path  over  the  period  1980-2010.  This 
trajectory is plotted in Figure 1 together with actual GDP growth rate (five years moving average).

Once the BPCG models intend to predict countries’ growth rates in the long run, the estimated 
BPCG rate path is expected not to predict the fluctuation of the GDP growth rate but to be a lot more 
stable. As we can see in Figure 1, during the 1980s and 1990s Brazil’s actual GDP growth rate floats 
around the estimated trajectory, indicating that these short term fluctuations are likely to be conjectural. 
In the 2000s, however, the model was able to predict the actual growth rate’s substantial increase (from 
around 2.5% to a peak of 4.0% in 2007), so that both series rise together. This outcome denotes that the 
faster growth in this last decade seems to be caused by a structural change, rather than better short-term 
economic scenery. Based on this work’s approach, therefore, we may interpret  such phenomena as a 
result  of  a  better  balance-of-payments  condition,  as  Brazil’s  export  structure  is  based  on  natural 
resources and LIC start growing faster during this same period. 

Araujo and Lima (2007)’s multisectoral model (presented in Section 3) has also been applied to 
several developing countries (including Brazil) by Gouvea and Lima (2010). This empirical study has 
demonstrated that Araujo and Lima’s model identifies the fall in Brazil’s GDP growth rate during the 
1990s as structural, explaining it by a drop in the estimated BPCG rate. According to Gouvea and Lima 
(2010), this downwards trajectory of the BPCG rate is because “the weighted elasticity of imports grew 
more than the weighted elasticity of exports over the period, which made for a fall in the ratio of trade

It is important to note that the model developed here may also generate this same 
outcome,  which  arrives  because  both  models  divide  the  income  elasticities  in  sectors.  This  division 
enabled the growth of high-tech imports (which have higher elasticities) during this decade to produce 
a drop in the income elasticities ratio, and thus in the calculated BPCG rate. 

However, the events behind this drop in the long-term growth rate during the 1990s are distinct 
from  the ones that took  place in  the 2000s. While the first  structural  change was mainly  related to  a 
change  in  the  income  elasticity  of  imports  (due  to  the  commercial  openness  in  the  early  1990s),  the 
structural  change  in  the  2000s  was  a  consequence  of  the  non-homogeneous  growth  among  trading 
partners with different income elasticities. This second mechanism is not captured by Araujo and Lima 
(2007)’s approach. 

In order to consider the impacts of this structural change in world demand the present model has 
also divided the income elasticities of exports by  trading partners. By doing so, it is then possible to 
conclude that Brazil’s growth in the 2000s was not only a consequence of the wealth effects of favourable 
terms  of  trade  (such  as  identified  in  Canuto,  Cavallari  and  Reis,  2013)  but  also  caused  by  structural 
changes in the balance-of-payments dynamics.  

Furthermore,  the  model  developed  here  is  also  capable  of  decomposing  Brazil’s  sources  of 
growth into HIC’s and LIC’s contribution. Figure 2 shows the impact of the demand for Brazilian exports 
of each group of countries on the BPCG rate. The contribution of each group of country is obtained by 
considering equation (20) for two commercial partners, as follow:

where the term in the left side presents the contribution of LIC for the Brazilian BPCG rate, and the term

BPCG rate is given by the sum of each contribution. 
 

Figure 2 – Decomposition of Brazilian BPCG rate (Last 5 years moving average)

 
The figure shows that during the 2000s Brazil’s BPCG rate has increased mainly due to LIC’s 
demand growth. Looking at this decade, it is possible to see a clear upward trend between 2002 and 2008 
when  LIC’s  stronger  demand  for  Brazilian  exports  affected  Brazil’s  BPCG  by  2.0  p.p.  (LIC’s

Such growth in the BPCG rate was not even higher because HIC’s 
contribution dropped from 1.3% in 2002 to 1.0% in 2008. 

Additionally,  Figure  2  evinces  the  negative  impact  of  the  international  financial  crisis  on  the 
Brazilian  BPCG  rate.  From  2007  on,  the  HIC’s  growth  rate  has  dropped  significantly,  leading  to  a 
decrease in the estimated rate. Although it does not mean that Brazil’s actual growth rate is going to fall, 
the model indicates that, if the country keeps growing at the same rate as before the crisis, it might have 
difficulties in financing its imports and, eventually, face a balance-of-payments crisis. 

 

4.3. Applying the model to developing economies according to categories of demand 

We have seen in the last subsection that the Brazilian faster growth in the 2000s was mainly due 
to a faster growth of LIC. However, because Brazil is a natural-resource exporter14, it is relatively more 
affected by a faster growth of LIC than economies that export other products predominantly. Thereby, 
as we are interested in the general impact of these structural changes on economic growth, this same 
model has been applied to a larger set of developing countries. 

This empirical analysis is based on a 46 years (1962 to 2007) panel data for 13 countries (6 from 
South America and 7 from South & East Asia). Rather than estimating the income elasticities for each 
country separately through a time-series model, a long-panel data methodology is employed to estimate 
equations (22) and (23). This technique is preferable to analyse panels where both cross-section and time 
dimensions have a moderated size (Cameron and Trivedi, 2009:265-266), such as here. 

Because in  panels  with  a large number of periods the relationship  between variables might  be 
spurious, nonstationarity deserves attention. Hence, it is first desirable to investigate whether the time-
series are stationary, and, if not but they have the same integration order, whether they are cointegrated. 
Once  distinct  unit  root  and  cointegration  analysis  are  employed  according  to  cross-sections’ 
dependence (CD), we start by applying the Pesaran (2004)’s CD test15 to all series but high- and low-
income countries’ GDP16. Nevertheless, every series has shown to be cross-sectional dependent at the 
1%  significance  level,  and  hence,  in  order  verify  the  presence  of  unit  roots,  the  Pesaran  (2007) 
stationarity  test  was  employed  to  all.  The  Pesaran  (2007)  test  considers  CD  through  the  inclusion  of 
lagged differences in group-specific ADF regressions.  

Because this test is very sensitive to number of lags and presence of trends, many specifications 
were considered. All series proved to be nonstationary (the null hypothesis of nonstationarity was not 
rejected) when trend is not included and at least one lag is included. However, when trend is included, 
results  are  somewhat  controversial:  the  null  hypothesis  of  nonstationarity  was  rejected  for  countries’ 
GDP  when  three  lags  or  less  are  included,  as  well  as  for  natural  resources  imports  and  consumption 
goods  exports  to  HIC  when  two  lags  or  less  are  included.  Thus,  under  a  conservative  approach,  all 
variables but imports of natural resources and exports of consumption goods to high-income countries 
were considered to be nonstationary17.  

Different methodologies were employed depending on the result of the unit root test. Firstly, for 
those series that do not present unit roots (imports of natural resources and exports of consumption goods 

                                                 
14According  to  Canuto,  Cavallari  and  Reis  (2013)  “[in  the  2009-2011  period]  the  most  important  Brazilian  exports  are 
minerals (25.2 percent), foodstuffs (13.8 percent), and vegetables (12.3 percent)”. Additionally, “Brazilian exports showed 
increased concentration for products in recent years. Commodity products gained significant relevance”. 
15 The advantage of the Pesaran (2004)’s CD test is that it can be performed for single nonstationary series, whilst Friedman's 
Chi-Square  distribution  and  Frees's  Q-distribution  tests  can  only  be  used  to  analyse  the  residuals  of  stationary  panel 
regressions. 
16 High- and low-income countries’ GDP are not tested for CD because they are not country-specific, and hence time-series 
analysis are employed rather than panel analysis. As presented in the last subsection, high-income countries’ GDP presents 
stationarity according to PP but not according to ADF test, whilst low-income countries’ GDP has shown to have one unit 
root according to both.  
17 To those series analysed through time-series methods, the choice between ADF and PP tests was arbitrary depending on 
the series that is regressed to obtain the elasticity. In the case of the income elasticity of demand for CG exports, high-income 
countries’ GDP was considered as stationary (following the PP test), whilst in the case of the income elasticities of demand 
for NR and KG exports, high-income countries’ GDP was considered as nonstationary (following the ADF test).

to  high-income  countries),  income  elasticities  of  demand  can  be  straightforward  estimated  through  a 
stationary  long  panel  GLS  method  assuming  individual  fixed  effects  and  a  panel  specific  AR(1) 
autoregressive  structure.  This  technique  was  chosen  over  a  traditional  panel  estimation  because  the 
requirements regarding the error’s structure can be lessened, namely: (1) the error terms in the model 
may be correlated over countries and over time; and (2) the error do not need to be homoscedastic nor 
cross-sectional independent. 

Secondly, for all others series, which were considered as nonstationary, multiple error correction 
based cointegration tests (Westerlund, 2007) were performed first. The Westerlund’s cointegration tests 
allow for heterogeneity and dependence across the cross-sectional units. As the null hypothesis of non-
cointegration was rejected to all variables on at least one of Westerlund’s tests, the possibility of a long-
term relationship between exports or imports and income should be considered. Thus, the elasticities of 
import  and  export  (the  long-term  relationship  between  these  variables  and  income)  were  obtained 
through  Panel  Dynamic  OLS  (Kao  and  Chang,  2000)  with  lags  and  leads  determined  by  Wald  Chi-
Squared Statistics. The advantage of this estimation method in comparison to the fully modified OLS 
(FMOLS) is that, for finite samples, the estimator’s bias is reduced (Baltagi, 2013). 

Table 3 presents the results for income elasticities of demand for exports, considering both the 

South American and the South & East Asian countries separately, and the whole sample.

As is clear from Table 3, for South American and South and East Asian countries the income 
elasticities of exports tend to be higher in capital  goods, and lower in natural resource products. The 
income elasticities of demand range from 1.45 to 2.95 for NR exports, from 2.89 to 3.85 for CG exports, 
and from 2.59 to 6.00 for KG exports. Thereby, an increase of the share of capital goods exports boosts 
these countries’ BPCG rate. Moreover, similarly to the results obtained for Brazil (although in a lower 
scale), Table 3 shows that in both regions the income elasticities of natural resources is greater regarding 
exports to LIC than to HIC. It means that the demand for these products would expand relatively more 
in face of a faster growth of LIC than in face of a faster growth of HIC. In other words, although an 
increase in LIC’s growth rate accentuates the demand for capital goods relatively more than the demand 
for  natural  resources, if  HIC  experience this same growth  the  accentuation  in  the demand for  capital 
goods is even higher than the demand for natural resources. 

Considering the weight of these sectors on total exports, we verify some differences between the 
weighted  income  elasticities  of  these  two  groups  when  comparing  them  in  terms  of  the  exports’ 
destination. Asian countries present higher elasticities in their exports to HIC once they export capital 
and  consumption  goods  predominantly.  Therefore,  their  exports  increase  relatively  more  if  HIC  are 
growing faster than LIC. On the other hand, the opposite is valid in the case of South American countries. 
Because they export natural resources predominantly, their weighted income elasticities are higher to 
LIC than to HIC.18   

Furthermore, as LIC are growing faster than HIC since the early 2000s, this difference suggests 
that South American countries are benefiting from lower balance-of-payment constraints in the recent

Asian countries’ exports.

period. As South American countries export predominantly natural resources, and the elasticities of these 
goods are higher to LIC than to HIC, a faster growth of LIC compared to HIC increases relatively more 
the demand for these goods. However, if LIC’s growth rates drop, South American countries shall be 
the most affected economies. 

Finally,  by  analysing  the  estimated  income  elasticities  of  demand  for  imports  some  relevant 
issues also emerge. Such results are shown in Table 4. We may notice that the elasticities of demand are 
higher for capital goods than for natural resource imports in both groups of countries, meaning that, on 
average,  a  faster  growth  of  an  Asian  economy  or  of  a  South  American  economy,  both  increase  the 
demand for capital  goods  most rapidly. This  result corroborates Gouvea and  Lima (2010)’s findings, 
where the authors conclude that “when the values of the income elasticities are compared among sectors 
of the same country, it seen that the technology sectors have higher income elasticities than the resource-
based sectors”.

Moreover,  Asian  countries’  income  elasticities  for  imports  are  lower  than  Latin  American 
countries’ elasticities, especially regarding capital and consumption goods. Due to this, South American 
countries’ BPCG rates tend to be lower than the Asian countries’ rates, once the accentuation of demand 
for imports in face of a faster growth is greater in South American economies than in Asian economies. 
Thereby, in order to boost their growth rate in the long run, South American countries must change their 
imports’ structure (by reducing the share of capital and consumption goods) or, otherwise, they will need 
to rely on the high demand for their natural resources (which depends on LIC’s relatively fast growth) 
to compensate their high income elasticities of imports. 

 

4.4. Applying the model to developing economies according to technologic intensity 

The  same  methodology  presented  in  the  last  subsection  was  employed  here  to  estimate  the 
income elasticities of demand for imports and exports according to sectors’ technological intensity. First, 
series were tested for the presence of CD. According to Pesaran (2004)’s test, all series present CD, and 
thus they were tested for the presence of unit roots through the Pesaran (2007)’s test. According to this 
test, only PR and LT exports to HIC were pointed out as nonstationary. Hence, income elasticities of 
demand for PR and LT exports to HIC were estimated through a GLS fixed effects panel model, in which 
a panel specific AR(1) autoregressive structure was assumed, as well as heteroskedasticity and cross-
sectional  dependence.  For  the  remaining  series,  the  Westerlund  (2007)  error  correction  based 
cointegration tests were performed, and, again, the null hypothesis of non-cointegration was rejected by 
at least one of the Westerlund’s tests in all cases. Thereby, all income elasticities of demand for imports 
were estimated through a Panel Dynamic OLS, as well as the income elasticities of demand for exports 
to LIC and the income elasticity of demand for HT exports to HIC. 

Table 5 presents the results of these estimations. Similarly to what has been found for NR, the 
results for PR show higher income elasticities of demand for exports to LIC than to HIC in all samples19. 
This  outcome reinforces the relevance of the  LIC’s faster growth  to  explaining the increase in  South 
American  countries’  growth  rates  during  the  2000s.  Because  South  America  exports  primary  goods 

                                                 
19 Only for South & East Asia, this difference is not statistically significant at the 5% level.

predominantly20, a faster growth of LIC relatively to HIC positively impacts South American countries’ 
weighted income elasticity and, consequently, their BPCG rates.

The  income  elasticities  of  demand  for  HT  exports  and  imports  are  greater  than  the  income 
elasticities for LT in all cases21, showing the importance of raising the share of HT in total exports and 
reducing the share of HT in total imports in order to increase BPCG rates. When elasticities of demand 
for HT are compared to elasticities of demand for PR, similar results are found: all income elasticities 
of demand for HT are higher than for PR, except regarding South America’s imports22. Therefore, one 
may  conclude  that  increasing  the  technological  intensity  of  exports  is  crucial  to  reducing  countries’ 
balance-of-payment constraints, and, consequently, to guaranteeing high and sustained growth rates in 
the long run. 

 

5.  Concluding remarks 

As we have seen along the work, the world is facing important changes in terms of its structure 
of  production,  and  it  implies  in  a  structural  change  in  demand  between  countries.  Although  the 
worldwide growth rate has been shrinking since the 1990s, it is not a homogeneous fall. While high-
income countries’ growth rates have been decreasing, low and middle-income countries are experiencing 
a faster increase in their growth rates, particularly from the 2000s on. This non-homogeneous process of 
growing has relevant implications on the world structure of demand, and thus in the trade flows, because 
the demand of each of these groups of countries is different. 

In  this  context,  the  multisectoral  version  of  Thirlwall’s  model  (Araujo  and  Lima,  2007)  is 
combined  with  Thirlwall’s  multilateral  version  (Nell,  2003)  in  order  to  render  the  impacts  of  these 
structural changes in world demand as endogenous. The good predictability of the multisectoral BPCG 
model (Araujo and Lima, 2007) is difficult to be refuted, once it is very efficient at treating structural 
changes inside countries as endogenous. These model, however, were not able to capture the previously 
treated changes, once these changes affect both the importance of each trading partner in growing and 
the sectoral  structure of exports. Whence, the model developed in  this paper render these changes as 
endogenous by dividing the income elasticities of demand for exports between different trading partners 
and sectors. By doing so, the non-homogeneous growth rates across countries with different structures 
of demand are incorporated in the model, and thus the impacts of structural changes in world demand 
on countries’ BPCG rates can be calculated explicitly. 

Further, the central thesis that income elasticities of demand vary according to trading partners’ 
income levels and that such differences are relevant in explaining countries’ growth rates is corroborated 
by an  empirical  investigation for Brazil. Although  the impact  of a faster  growth of  LIC on Brazilian 
capital and consumption goods exports has shown to be lower to the impact of a faster growth of HIC, 
it increases the demand for Brazilian NR products 60% more. This fact helps understanding why natural-

resource exporters, such as Brazil, have been experiencing lower balance-of-payments constraints since 
the 2000s (when LIC start growing by 6.0% per year). This analysis, thus, suggests that these countries’ 
higher growth rates in the last decade are not only due to a wealth effect caused by an increase on its 
terms-of-trade, but also due to a faster growth of LIC demand for natural resources.  

When other developing economies are considered, however, the outcomes show that an increase 
of  growth  rates  based  on  natural-resource  exports  might  be  unsustainable  in  the  long  run,  once  the 
income elasticities of demand for imports and for exports are higher for more technological advanced 
sectors. Because of that, structural changes in the composition of exports and imports turn into important 
determinants of the BPCG rate. This fact emerges because, although a country can achieve higher growth 
rates without facing balance-of-payments constraints if their trading partners are growing faster (such as 
Brazil during the 2000s), the share of capital and consumption goods exports must increase (or the share 
of the imports of these goods must decrease) in order to boost its growth rate in the long term without 
relying on its trading partners’ growth. 

As  a  final  remark,  it  is  highlighted  that  the  contribution  of  this  study  on  the  importance  of 
rendering structural changes in the world demand as endogenous in BPCG models does not deplete the 
subject. Hence, further studies are needed in order to fully understand the complexity of such changes 
and to what extent they are relevant in the long run. For example, if HIC’s growth rates start increasing 
(or LIC’s growth rates start decreasing), these structural changes will no longer be an  issue, once the 
world growth would be homogeneous. 

Likewise, as LIC are growing by 6.0% per year, their income elasticities are approaching HIC’s 
as their income level increases, which tends to lower the relevance of non-homogeneous growth among 
countries. Thereby, in the present economic scenery, natural resource exporters could take advantage 
from  lower balance-of-payments  constrains  (caused by the faster  growth  of developing countries) by 
shifting their structure of production towards more technological sectors. This is due to the fact that the 
increase of high-tech exports (and the decrease of high-tech imports) is the ultimately determinant of a 
country’s growth rate in the long run.
