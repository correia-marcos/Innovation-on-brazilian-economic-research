RESUMO: 

Insegurança  alimentar  é  um  fenômeno  global;  mais  frequente  entre  os  países  mais  pobres,  mas  também 
presente  entre  os  mais  ricos  do  mundo.  Mais  frequente  entre  as  famílias  mais  pobres,  mas  também  uma 
preocupação  para  algumas  das  que  se  localizam  distantes  da  linha  de  pobreza.  Entender  como  as  famílias 
lidam  com  esse  fenômeno,  e  como  elas  tomam  suas  decisões  sobre  a  alocação  de  suas  rendas  e  tempo,  e 
como essa decisão se reverte em satisfação, é uma etapa importante na tentativa de acabar com a fome e com 
a  insegurança  alimentar.  Esse  entendimento  pode  ajudar  na  elaboração  de  programas  de  bem-estar,  cujos 
objetivos  sejam  diminuir  a  insegurança  alimentar.  Usando  dados  transversais  para  um  processo  de 
amostragem  repetido  do  Brasil  (PNAD/IBGE)  para  os  anos  de  2009  e  2013,  este  é  o  primeiro  trabalho  a 
avaliar o impacto do Programa Bolsa-Familia (PBF) na insegurança domiciliar, usando para isso um modelo 
que controla para o viés de seleção de variáveis observáveis e não observáveis. Estimativas do método diff-
in-diff,  com  e  sem  pareamento,  são  comparadas  com  as  estimativas  do  modelo  logit  ordenado.  As 
comparações  mostram  o  quanto  a  endogeneidade  pode  mascarar  os  resultados,  se  ela  não  for  tratada 
adequadamente. De acordo com as estimativas do modelo diff-in-diff com pareamento, o PBF é responsável 
por uma redução de 0.076 no índice de insegurança alimentar. 

ABSTRACT: 

Food  insecurity  is  a  global  phenomenon;  more  frequent  in  poor,  but  also  present  in  the  world’s  richest 
countries.  More  frequent  among  the  poorest,  but  also  a  concern  for  some  families  even  distant  from  the 
poverty line. Understand how families deal with this phenomenon, and how they make their decisions on the 
need  to  allocate  their  income  and  time,  and  how  this  decision  is  reversed  in  a  sense  of  satisfaction  is  an 
important  way  to  end  hunger  and  food  insecurity.  This  understanding  can  give  a  support  to  the  welfare 
programs, whose objectives are to diminish food insecurity. Using repeated cross-section data from Brazil 
(PNAD/IBGE)  for  the  years  of  2009  and  2013,  this  is  the  first  work  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  Bolsa-
Familia Program (BFP) on households’ food insecurity using a model that controls for the selection bias from 
observable and unobservable variables. The diff-in-diff estimates, with and without matching, are compared 
with the estimates of the ordered logit model. The comparisons show how much endogeneity can mask the 
results,  if  it  is  not  treated  properly.  According  to  the  estimates  of  the  diff-in-diff  results,  the  BFP  is 
responsible for a reduction of 0.076 in the food insecurity index. 
Key Words: Food Insecurity; Bolsa-Familia Program; Brazil; Diff-in-Diff.

INTRODUCTION 

The total number of the world’s undernourished decreased from 19% in 1992 to 12% in 2013, what shows 
a  good  progress  but  still  not  enough  to  meet  the  hunger  targets  defined  by  the  World  Food  Summit. 
According to the FAO (2013), meeting the hunger targets requires an additional and particular effort because 
the  determinants  of  undernourishment  go  beyond  monetary  poverty  and  solving  it  requires  more  than 
economic growth, whose benefits may not even reach everyone. 

Undernourishment  is  a  chronic  hunger  condition  and  an  extreme  consequence  of  a  food  insecurity 
situation, as an idea of accessibility to food2. There are less extreme consequences of food insecurity, which 
reveals different levels of malnutrition, just as there are different levels of food insecurity. Understanding its 
nuances  and  causes  is  an  important  challenge  to  scholars,  because  its  consequences  can  lead  to  a  vicious 
cycle of poverty. 

Alongside  the  health  and  growth  specific  problems  (Kreider  et  al.,  2009),  malnutrition  in  children  can 
prompt long-run negative effects through its impacts on labor productivity, which in turn can determine the 
level and composition of employment (Strauss and Thomas, 1998). Despite few empirical studies considering 
this relationship, theoretically it can be explained first by improved physical performance as a consequence 
of calorie and vitamin intake; and second, through the effects on the cognitive and behavioral development, 
and social functioning (Swindale et a.l 2013; Schultz, 2005). According to Cook and Frank (2008), children 
suffer these consequences even when they are exposed to the mildest levels of food insecurity. 

Food Insecurity (FI) has a particular importance in developing countries (FAO, 2013), but its incidence in 
developed economies is also fairly high. Coleman-Jensen et al. (2014) reported that 14,3% of the American 
households were food insecure in 2013; Loopstra e Tarasuk (2013) revealed that in Canada, in 2011, there 
was around 12% of household food insecurity; Loopstra et al. (2015) registered a prevalence of 11% of food 
insecurity  among  European  households  in  2012;  and  Martin-Fernandez  et  al.  (2013)  estimated  that  6%  of 
households in the Paris region had experienced food insecurity. Pfeiffer et al. (2015) revealed that, in 2012, 
food insecurity was greater than 14% for Greece, was more than 9% for UK Great Britain, and for Germany 
was 8%. 

According  to  Loopstra  et  al.  (2015),  after  2010,  the  food  insecurity  in  Europe  has  grown  certainly 
triggered  by  the  austerity  policies.  However,  they  point  out  that  there  must  be  ways  to  tackle  the  crisis 
without food losses, because even though Portugal has been strongly affected by this crisis, its proportion of 
food insecurity households has decreased in the same period. Nord Andrews and Carlson (2004) complement 
this evidence at the microeconomic level and show, intriguingly, the strong presence of food insecurity even 
for households that are far from the poverty line3. 

The  study  of  this  phenomenon  is  important  because  it  can  also  help  in  understanding  the  role  that 
assistance programs can play in alleviating food insecurity. These programs have been adopted by different 
countries, such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Canada and the United States. Especially in the case of the latter, 
the effectiveness of these policies has been highly discussed in the economic literature. 

In this literature, the food insecurity determinants can assume the role of control variables in an analysis 
that  primarily  aims  to  investigate  the  impacts  of  the  Program  on  food  insecurity.  The  proposed  models 
consider increasingly the endogeneity of income transfers. This means that both the eligibility to assistance 
programs  is  influenced  by  the  fact  that  the  household  is  food  insecurity,  as  the  household  food  insecurity 
condition is influenced  by the  cash transfer program (Ratclife  et al.,  2011).  In  other words, there is a bias 
selection which is driven by non-unobservable characteristics. 
                                                           
2 For a more detailed discussion about the various concepts and measures of Food Insecurity, see Bertelli and Marcour (2014). This article adopts the idea of 
accessibility and use a measure based on a psychometric scale. 
3 These studies are not comparable, because they are based on different concepts of food insecurity.

Some  few  studies  have  used  matching  method.  In  particular,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  all  of  them 
have used the propensity score technique (Gibson-Davis and Foster, 2006, Camelo et al., 2009; Almeida et 
al., 2013). However, the propensity score matching, or any other matching technique, take into account just 
the selection bias due to observable variables, but not to the unobservable or omitted ones. 

A very common strategy for dealing with this endogeneity has been the use of the instrumental variables 
models (IV), mainly by the use of geographic and time differences in the programs design (Ratclife et al., 
2011). The IV models are powerful tools and have the advantage that they may be applied for cross-section 
data4, but they are very dependents on finding a good instrument. In this sense, they cannot be completely 
generalized, especially when the program does not find differences in application in a regional perspective, as 
is the case of Brazil, for example. 

This  paper  seeks  to  address  these  issues  by  proposing  the  propensity  score  matching  (Rosenbaum  and 
Rubin,  1983)  to  correct  the  selection  bias  caused  by  the  observable  variables.  And  to  deal  with  the  bias 
caused by omitted variables, it proposes the difference in differences method (Khandker et al., 2010). 

In  particular  it  seeks  to  investigate  the  impact  of  the  “Bolsa-Familia  Program”  (BFP)  on  the  Food 
Insecurity  index  of  Brazilian  households  between  the  years  of  2009  and  2013.  The  BFP  is  the  Brazilian 
conditioned income transfer, which serves approximately 14 million households5. It has been pointed out as 
the main responsible for taking Brazil away from the hunger global map6. But on the other hand, there are not 
nationally designed studies, which have investigated its efficacy in such a robust way. 

All  the  studies  summarized  by  Cotta  e  Machado  (2013),  Martins  et  al.  (2013)  or  Soares  et  al.  (2010) 
sought to identify a relationship between BFP and food insecurity in Brazil, however, all of them had either 
problems of bias selection or were restricted for just a small sample. In addition, at the national level, Camelo 
et al. (2009) and Almeida et al. (2013) corrected the analysis for selection bias using the Propensity  Score 
Matching (PSM), but they did not consider the potential bias of omitted variables7. 

Section  2  is  devoted  to  a  literature  review,  discussing  first  the  main  determinants  of  food  insecurity, 
second the identification of strategies and finally presenting the  main  features of BFP in Brazil.  Section 3 
describes the conceptual method, the data, and the empirical strategy used. Section 4 brings the results and 
the section 5 the main conclusions. 

2  REVIEW OF LITERATURE 

Food and nutritional security requires that the individuals have access to enough and healthy food in order to 
have an active and healthy life (FAO, 2013). This concept brings a simple idea, but its implementation in the 
form of an indicator is a bit complex, and as a consequence there are various measures of food insecurity in 
the literature. Perez-Escamilla and Segal-Corrêa (2008) summarize that the main types are based either on 
the:  daily  intake  of  calories  per  capita;  estimation  of  a  minimum  income;  frequency  and  amount  of  food 
consumed;  household  expenditure  with  food;  anthropometric  measurements;  or  psychometric  scales  of  the 
household  access  to  food8.  And  beyond  that,  borrowing  money  for  food  could  also  be  a  sign  of  food 
insecurity  (Chang  et  al.,  2014)9,  which  has  increasingly  been  used  as  a  measure  of  food  insecurity  by 
economists. 

                                                           
4 Although in the case of cross section data, it cannot allow for time varying selection bias (Khandker et al., 2010).

February. 
6 Rasella et al. (2013), for example, using a binomial model of fixed-effects found that the Bolsa-Familia Program (BFP) had contributed to decrease childhood 
mortality in Brazil. They concluded that this decrease was due to the positive effects of BFP on nutrition and health. 
7 Camelo et al. (2009) and Almeida et al. (2013) used different measures of food insecurity. The findings of these studies will be discussed in the results section. 
8 The empirical analysis of this work will be based on the Brazilian psychometric scale of the household access to food. 
9 The papers presented in the next session are based on any of these measures.

These are all measures related to the person or household, who suffers from the lack of food. That is, they 
are indicators of consumption decision. Certainly each of these has its advantages and limitations, they are 
not complete measures. Some of them depend on how food is allocated within the household, others on how 
it is used, and others even on which kind of food is bought (Costa et al., 2014). The choice of an indicator 
generally depends on the purpose of the work and on the availability of a database. 

Beyond  the  measure,  there  is  a  growing  literature  seeking  to  understand  the  determinants  of  food 
insecurity, in which it  is possible to identify two types of concerns. The first are the efforts to expand the 
explanatory variables; and the second are the efforts to estimate the impact of social welfare programs on it 
and deal with the endogeneity between them. The two following sessions are about these two subjects. And 
the third session describes the “Bolsa-Familia” Program in Brazil. 

2.1  Food Insecurity Determinants 

There is an extensive literature about food insecurity determinants both in health and nutrition and economics 
areas,  which  has  evolved  over  time10.  The  need  to  identify  all  possible  covariates  is  important  because  it 
reduces the bias of omitted variables (Heckman et al., 1997). 

The  main  determinants  of  food  insecurity  are  availability  and  accessibility  (Dean  and  Sharkey,  2011). 
Availability is clearly a condition of the food supply side, covering production itself, imports (if necessary), 
distribution and commercialization. On the other hand, accessibility is a physical and economical condition 
of the demand side, which means the ability to get food in sufficient quantity and quality (PNAD, 2010). 

From the standpoint of availability, at the micro level there are some direct measures, as the production 
for own consumption (Cock et al., 2013; Gertler,  2004), and the proximity to sales and distribution points 
(Thomas, 2010). At the meso level, the local production of food and the differences between the economics 
dynamics (Bartfeld and Dunifon, 2006) are the alternatives measures used. In this context, however, there is 
the  understanding  that  production  increase  is  a  necessary  condition,  but  it  is  not  sufficient  to  ensure  food 
security (Sidhu et al., 2008). 

These direct measures are in the meantime relatively rare in the empirical literature. At the micro level, it 
happens perhaps due to limitations of its applicability to a broader analysis. The studies which evaluated the 
production for own consumption, for example, are restricted to the rural areas, because the majority of the 
urban  households  doesn’t  produces  food  for  own  consumption.11  The  proximity  to  sales  and  distribution 
points  brings  the  analysis  to  more  restricted  samples,  due  to  the  difficulty  of  taking  the  distances  of  each 
residence  to  them.  At  the  meso  level  the  differences  can  also  been  seen  as  state  or  regional  fixed  effects 
(Bartfeld and Dunifon 2006; Coleman-Jensen et al. 2012)12. 

Thus, the solution to these limitations has been found in the use of some indirect measures, as proxies of 
the food availability. The mainstream has been the spatial explanation of the household location in terms of 
its area (rural or urban) and region (if a metropolitan one). It is expected that urban areas and metropolitan 
regions have greater availability of food. And the relation is absolutely intuitive: the greater food availability 
the smallest food insecurity (Nord et al., 2009). 

Concerning access, there is already a consensus about some variables which are present in almost every 
discussion  about  food  insecurity.  These  variables  are  divided  into  two  levels.  At  the  level  of  the  head  of 
household,  some  characteristics  of  her  (his)  profile  are  highlighted,  like  age,  race  (being  black),  gender 
(being  a  man),  and  education.  At  the  level  of  household  the  most  used  characteristics  are  income  and  the 
number of children. The positive correlation of all this variables with food insecurity is also a consensus in 
                                                           
10 This revision doesn’t have the intention to be exhaustible, indeed it will just to highlight the most important aspects of the discussion. 
11 The idea of producing food here doesn’t include the cooking process differentiating frozen food from fresh food. It is referred just to the process of growing it. 
12 The state or regional fixed effects are also used to represent the accessibility to federal nutrition programs, and income supports.

the literature, some with more direct and intuitive reasonable and some with a more indirect and less intuitive 
explanation.13 

Some authors, however, have expanded the importance of household assets in determining food security. 
The idea is based on the Friedman’s work of 1957, which has tested the hypothesis that there is a positive 
relation between the ownership of assets and food expenditures (Chang et al., 2014), and the relationship is 
not simply a matter of income effect. 

For most poor people, the decision to have good nutrition can compete with the decision of living secure. 
So, homeownership becomes an important variable, being negatively related to food insecurity (Chang, 2014; 
Omidvar  et  al.,  2013;  Gertler,  2004;  Gundersen  and  Gruber,  2001;  Rose,  Gundersen  e  Oliveira,  1998). 
However,  a  high  burden  for  housing  payment  has  a  positive  correlation  with  it  (Omidvar  et  al.,  2013;  De 
Marco and Thorburn, 2009), probably due to the available income. 

The importance of assets holdings in cushioning food insecurity has been studied just by some few authors 
and  they  were  mostly  qualitative  studies  (Chang  et  al.,  2014).  In  the  quantitative  literature,  Guo  (2011) 
argued that in the presence of household assets, especially savings, the power of income in explaining food 
insecurity  was  decreased.  But  Fitzpatrick  (2013)  found  that  this  happened  just  for  those  having  banking 
accounts,  but  not  for  those  related  to  the  alternative  financial  services.  For  her,  credit  transactions  lead  to 
worse results of food insecurity than liquidity. Chang and their colleagues studied the importance of having a 
minimum  level  of  savings  and  of  not  borrowing  beyond  a  suggested  maximum.  They  concluded  that  the 
liquidity constraint and asset inadequacy were positively associated with food insecurity, mainly among poor 
households. In an analysis for Toronto, in Canada, Tarasuk (2001) also met that the need to additional and 
unusual expenditures and accumulated debts were negatively related to food security. 

Vehicle  ownership  is  also  an  asset  to  be  considered  by  households,  but  it  affects  food  insecurity  by  a 
slightly different  way. According to Clifton (2004),14 it can be  used as  a  mobility strategy  to facilitate the 
access  to  food,  to  Locher  et  al.  (2005)  as  an  indicator  of  social  isolation,  and  to  Fitzpatrick  and  Ploeg 
(2010),15  it  can  help  to  avoid  the  more  expensive  and  less  healthy  solutions  from  the  neighborhood.  The 
evidences  have  supported  the  idea  that  vehicle  ownership  could  help  lower  food  insecurity  (Chang  et  al., 
2014; Fitzpatrick and Ploeg, 2010; and De Marco and Thorburn, 2009). 

Martin  et  al.  (2004)  shows  that  social  capital,  both  at  the  household  and  at  the  community  levels,  is 
positively related to food security. Being a measure of trust, reciprocity and social networks, it can improve 
the households’ ability of having access to food. Dean and Sharkey (2011) have also negatively associated 
social capital with food insecurity, but their measure of the social capital was a very subjective one, based in 
the  individual  perception.  According  to  Tarasuk  (2001),  socially  isolated  women  also  relate  more  food 
insecurity. And the number of  years since immigration to Toronto for Loopstra and Tarasuk (2013) or the 
duration of residency of Afghan immigrants in Iran for Omidvar et al. (2013), both seen as a proxy of social 
networks, is also negatively related to food insecurity. 

Neighborhood  socio-economic  status  is  an  important  measure  to  Martin-Fernandez  et  al.  (2013)  and  to 
Omidvar et al. (2013). These authors associated socio-economic status of location to the food insecurity and 
found that living in low and middle income neighborhoods increases insecurity when compared to the higher 
ones. The poorer neighborhood, the larger will be the impact on food insecurity. 

But social disparities are also important to explain food insecurity according to Dean and Sharkey (2011). 
The  authors  used  a  measure  of  the  perceived  personal  disparity  in  a  region  of  Central  Texas  in  USA  and

found a positive relation. They argue that these feeling can reflect the personal experiences with the unequal 
distribution of all food-related resources. 

Due to the importance of the informal employment to less developed countries (Faye et al., 2011) some 
studies  have  used  this  category  of  work  as  explicative  to  food  insecurity.  It  is  expected  that  formal 
employment  increase  food  security  through  the  stability  of  the  household  finances  (IBASE,  2008;  PNAD, 
2010;  and  Cotta  e  Machado;  2013).  Evaluating  Brazilian  data,  Hoffman  (2008)  finds  this  positive 
relationship. Cock et al. (2013) makes reference to a formal salary being important for food insecurity in a 
province  of  South  Africa,  but  they  don’t  regress  on  it.  Some  authors  have  also  considered  the  socio-
occupational category, as did Martin-Fernandez et al. (2013). 

There are just few studies addressing state or regional demographic and socio-economic characteristics. 
Bartfeld  and  Dunifon  (2006)  developed  a  hierarchical  model  in  which  the  second  level  of  explainable 
variables  was  at  the  state  dimension,  termed  as  the  state  food  security  infrastructure.  The  food  security 
infrastructure  is  defined  as  the  state  context  of  the  economic  and  social  attributes  that  affect  the 
accessibility16 to food. 

2.2  The effects of programs on food insecurity and the identification strategy 

There are different assistance programs around the world, with explicit objectives of alleviating hunger and 
food insecurity. They have different characteristics and conditionality, what may lead to different outcomes. 
The majority of the studies seeking to understand the effects of these programs on food insecurity are about 
the  American  programs,  especially  among  those  which  have  adopted  more  robust  analysis.  But  the 
identification questions are relatively the same. 

There are two key identification questions in this kind of analysis. The first is related to the misreporting 
of participation status;17 and the second is the endogenous selection into participation (Kreider et al., 2012). 
Some identification strategy should then be used to cope with both, because both can lead to biased results. 
Referring to misreporting, Gundersen et al. (2011) consider that because the omission errors are more likely 
than  the  commission  errors  (as  had  been  proved  by  Bollinger  and  David,  2001)  there  is  a  tendency  to 
understate  the  program  impact.  Kreider  et  al.  (2012)  is  the  only  food  insecurity  study  to  consider  both 
problems,  through  extended  partial  bounding  methods,  and  found  a  negative  effect  of  the  program 
participation on food insecurity. 

The  endogenous  selection  into  participation  can  happen  in  both  temporal  and  cross-section  analysis.  In 
temporal  analysis,  bias  can  come  from  household  characteristics  that  are  unobserved  and  changeable  over 
time, like the head of household’s efforts to ameliorate food insecurity,  or from the changing food market 
availability  conditions,  or  even  from  any  of  other  unobservable  factors  that  can  affect  food  insecurity 
(Gertler, 2011). From the point of view of cross-section analysis, it is expected that the households that are 
more likely to be eligible to the Bolsa-Famila Program (BFP) are also probably the most food insecure. This 
means that there is a positive association between food insecurity and  the eligibility to the BFP,  what can 
result  in  an  underestimation  of  the  BFP’s  effects.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  likely  that  those  families  who 
enrolled in the Program are better organized than those who qualify but didn’t get enrolled; this leads to a 
negative  association  between  food  insecurity  and  the  Program,  what  in  turn  can  lead  to  overstate  the 
program’s  effects  (Gibson-Davis  and  Foster,  2006).  Therefore,  the  statistical  model  to  be  estimated  has  to 
deal with this. 

                                                           
16 In truth, they say that it affects also the availability and affordability of food. However, at the way they have defined it, it is similar to the definition of 
accessibility used here. 
17 Gundersen and Kreider (2008) bring the possibility that misreported food insecurity exacerbates uncertainty. However, this will not be treated in this article, 
because there is not empirical research on this subject. 

6 

 

Among  the  works  which  have  controlled  for  endogeneity,  some  didn’t  find  any  relations  evidence 
between the program and food insecurity (Gundersen and Oliveira, 2011), and others found a negative effect, 
what  means  that  the  program  has  been  successful  in  alleviating  food  insecurity  (Van  Hook  and  Ballisteri, 
2006; Yen et al., 2008; Nord and Prell, 2011; Ratclife, 2011; Bonanno and Li, 2015). Ratclife et al. (2011) 
was the first study to control endogeneity taking into account a nationally representative sample of the United 
States of America from the late 1990 and early to midi 2000. Their work was followed by Bonanno and Li 
(2015), in methodology and results. 

All  of  them  used  some  kind  of  dummy  endogenous  variable  model  with  instrumental  variables.  The 
instruments  were  generally  the  state  differences  in  the  program  implementation,  like  if  they  use  biometric 
technology,  if  there  is  none,  partial,  or  full  immigrant  eligibility,  or  the  outreach  spending  percapita.  For 
temporal analysis, a temporary increase in the benefits was used. 

Gibson-Davis  and  Foster  (2006)  balanced  treatment  and  comparison  groups  on  the  observable 
socioeconomic characteristics of households in a cross-section analysis. They adjusted the propensity score 
matching method and found that the food stamp program in USA did not decrease the probability of being 
food insecure for children. However, they didn’t control the unobservable variables and they recognize that 
there are some limitations inherent to the method and that more studies would have to be done. 

Chang et al. (2014) did not control endogeneity at all, but they found different effects depending on the 
program  evaluated.  They  have  estimated  a  negative  association  with  a  cash  transfer  program  (Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families), and a positive association with the directed food assistance programs. They 
believe that endogeneity problems should have biased the analysis of the second group of programs. 

2.3  The Bolsa-Familia Program18 

The Bolsa-Familia Program (BFP) was created in the year of 2004. It has incorporated all the pre-existing 
smaller  programs19  and  since  then,  each  year,  it  increases  the  number  of  attended  people.  It  is  under  the 
supervision  of  the  “Ministry  of  Social  Development  and  Fight  against  Hunger”  which  define  the  rules  of 
eligibility,  maintain  the  register20  of  all  the  eligible  families,  and  decide  how  much  can  be  given  to  each 
family according to each criterion. 

The  municipalities  are  responsible  to  register  their  poor  families  according  to  the  stipulated  rules.  The 
program’s  implementation  is  done  by  the  “Caixa  Econômica  Federal”,  that  is  a  financial  institution  of  the 
federal government. It receives the information from the Ministry and calculates how much each family has 
to receive, prepares the program cards, and makes the monthly payment. 

BFP is a cash transfer program and all its grants are transferred through the “Bolsa-Familia card”. In 93% 
of cases the card is in the name of the family’s reference woman, however, anyone can pick up the money at 
any ATM, provided they have the card and its password. 

The program’s objectives are: fight hunger and promote food security; fight poverty and other forms of 
deprivation; and promoting access to public services network, in particular health, education, food security 
and social assistance. 

The eligibility to the Program is related to the definition of two poverty lines, both based on the monthly 
household per capita income. For both years of the sample, the reference value of the extreme poverty line 
was  US$19.8  and  the  poverty  line  was  US$39.6.21  The  extremely  poor  families  can  receive  two  kinds  of 
benefits, a fixed of US$19.8, and a variable one, which is the same for the poor families. The variable benefit

19 The Programs’ names were: “Fome Zero”, “Bolsa Escola”, “Auxílio Gás” e “Cartão Alimentação”. 
20 The register is called “Cadastro Único”.

depends  on  the  number  of  children  (0  to  15  years  old),  teenagers  (16  to  18),  and  pregnant  women  in 
household. The maximum possible value a family can receive is US$94.1. 

The  BFP  conditions  the  receipt  of  the  benefit  over  the  fulfillment  of  certain  requirements  of  health 
monitoring  and  school  attendance.  Under  the  Program,  children  (between  0  and  7  years  old)  and  women 
(between 14 and 44) have to report to be systematically evaluated by a family health program team. And all 
the pregnant women have also to follow a schedule of visits to the health team. The terms of the education-
related condition are targeted at children and young people between 6 and 17 years. They must be properly 
enrolled in school and have a minimum school attendance. 

Currently  there  are  approximately  14  millions  of  beneficiary  families  scattered  throughout  the  national 
territory. The food insecurity mean and the proportion of the total beneficiaries are shown by region in Table 
1.

The  BFP  has  been  evaluated  in  different  aspects  in  Brazil.  Some  scholars  are  interested  in  knowing  its 
impacts  on  the  women  fertility  (Cechin  et  al.,  2015);  on  the  female  labor  supply  (Tavares,  2010);  on  the 
income  inequality  (Peña  et  al.,  2015);  on  education  (Glewwe  e  Kassouf,  2012);  on  presidential  election 
(Canêdo-Pinheiro, 2015); childhood mortality (Rasella et al., 2013), among others. 

There are also some studies concerning food insecurity. Cabral et al. (2014) performed an analysis for a 
beneficiaries’ small sample of two municipalities of the northeast region. But despite using longitudinal data, 
they made just a descriptive analysis and recorded an increase in food security and mild food insecurity, at 
the expense of moderate and severe food insecurity. Camelo et al. (2009) controlled the observable variables 
using the propensity score matching technique. They used secondary data of a national sample of more than 4 
thousand children and found significant influences of the program on turning household food secure (against 
insecure). but none has controlled for endogeneity problems. 

3.1  Conceptual Approach: difference-in-differences technique 

3  METHODS 

Food is a normal good, whose income elasticity is possibly close to one for low-income populations. Maybe 
that's  why  the  Bolsa-Familia  Program  (BFP)  does  not  impose  restrictions  on  the  spending  of  the  received 
benefits. That is, it is expected that the benefit will be spent on food, alleviating hunger and food insecurity, 
which is one of the explicit Program’s objectives. 

Thus, it has to be tested if the program's benefit is really allowing a greater access to food, regardless of 
the household characteristics, and whether this access is being enough to affect the state of household food 
insecurity. But it is not a simple matter of observing household food insecurity changes before and after the 
household was benefited by the program (temporal analysis) because changes can be due to other temporal 
factors  affecting  this  household.  And  it  is  not  even  a  matter  of  just  comparing  the  food  insecurity  of 
households that received and did not receive the benefits (cross-section analysis), because the differences can 

8 

 

be due to individual and socioeconomic differences between them, which can be easily observable or not. All 
these views can under- or overstate the program’s effect (Gibson-Davis and Foster, 2006). 

However, it may be a case of combining these two methods into one (Gertler et al., 2011). A before-and-
after analysis may be done for the beneficiaries group (called first difference) and for a control group that 
was not beneficiated by the Program (called second difference). The impact of the program would be then the 
difference between these two differences, what is the Difference-in-Differences Method. Doing this, the time 
varying factors which are seen as confounders in the temporal analyses are eliminated. The result would be 
the  same  if  two  cross  section  analyses  were  done  in  two  different  times  and  a  difference  of  these  two 
differences  was taken.  In this case, the bias  selection, present in  each of both cross  section estimations, is 
eliminated of the analyses when the difference of the two differences is taken. 

The Equation 1 brings the relation stated above.

Where  ߚ஽஽  is  a  difference-in-differences  estimator,  which  gives  the  impact  of  the  treatment  on  the 
outcome  of  interest;  ܻ  represents  the  outcome  of  interest  to  be  evaluated;  T  is  the  treated  group;  C  is  the 
control group; and 1 and 0 represent the years of the baseline and follow-up, respectively. 

It is important to note that what is being compared is the change in outcomes, supposing that both groups 
are subjected to the same changes in time. That  is, they  are subjected to  the same exogenous  changes. Of 
course it is more reasonable as much comparable are the units. 

3.2  The Empirical Strategy 

Formally,  and  taking  into  account  the  discussion  raised  above,  food  insecurity  can  be  described  as  in  the 
Equation (2). 

(2) 

ܨ݋݋݀_ܫ݊ݏ = ݂(ܤܨܲ, ܺ, ܵܶ, ܶ) 

where ܨ݋݋݀_ܫ݊ݏ represents an indicator of Food Insecurity, BFP represents the Bolsa-Familia Program, X is 
a vector composed by the socioeconomic characteristics of the household and of the head of household raised 
above, ܵܶ symbolizes dummy variables for the Brazilian states and ܶ a dummy for the year of 2013. 

The question then becomes how to specify this function  in order to  estimate the impact of the ܤܨܲ on 
ܨ݋݋݀_ܫ݊ݏ.  Focusing  on  the  identification  issues,  the  following  sections  address  the  existing  endogeneity 
problems. 

The  proposed  model  by  this  work  is  the  difference-in-differences  approach  with  the  propensity  score 
matching technique. The first controls for the unobservable variables and the second for the observable ones. 

3.2.1  The difference-in-differences approach 

The difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of a program on an outcome of interest in the 
case of repeated cross section data without matching, can assume the form of the Equation 3. 

(3)  ܨ݋݋݀_ܫ݊ݏ௛௧ = 	 ߚ଴ +	ߚଵ	ܤܨܲ +	ߚଶ	ܶ +	ߚୈୈ(ܶ ∗ ܤܨܲ) +	ߚ௫ܺ௛௧ 	+ ߚ௭ܼ௦ 	+		ߝ௛௧; 

where h denotes household and t denotes time period (2009 or 2013). ܨܫ is the food insecurity indicator; ܶ is 
the time trend equal to 1 if the observation is in the follow-up period (2013); ܤܨܲ is an indicator equal to one

if the household is beneficiary of the program; ܺ represents the control variables related to the household; 
and  Z  represents  the  fixed  effects  for  the  states  (there  are  27  states.  ߚୈୈ  is  the  coefficient  for  the  DD 
estimator; in other words, ߚୈୈ represents the change in food insecurity, which is attributable to the BFP. 

The  difference-in-differences  (diff-in-diff)  approach  can  be  also  done  with  matching  on  the  set  of 
observable variables, ܺ௛௧. The diff-in-diff matching estimator sums the advantage of removing the effects of 
common  shocks,  imposed  by  the  linear  functional  form  (Blundel  and  Costa  Dias,  2000).  It  estimates  the 
conditional expectation of the FI reweighting the observations according to the weighting functions used by 
the  matching  estimators  (Smith  and  Todd,  2004).  The  diff-in-diff  matching  estimator  for  repeated  cross 
section data assumes the form of the Equation 4.

As it can be seen, three matching proceedings have to be done in this case for each treated individual of 
the year of 2013. The second term of the first parenthesis in the Equation 2 results from the matching process 
of  them  with  the  treated  individual  of  2009.  In  the  second  parenthesis,  the  first  term  comes  from  their 
matching with the non-beneficiaries of 2013 and the second term comes from their matching with the non-
beneficiaries of 2009. The matching method used was the Propensity Score. 

3.2.2  Propensity Score Matching 

The basic idea of matching is to impute counterfactual outcome for the program participants using eligible 
nonparticipants with the same propensity score. The Propensity Score Matching is given by the Expression 5: 

(5) 

ܲ(ܺ௜) = Pr	(ܦ௜ = 	 ଵ

). 

Where D is a dummy variable which assumes the value 1 when it is in the treatment group, i.e., it is a

socioeconomic  characteristics.  The  propensity  score  (ܲ(ܺ௜))  is  the  probability  of  a  household  with  certain 
characteristics (Xi) to participate of the BFP. 

Once obtained the propensity score, a matched group is constructed for the group of reference, based on 
proximity criteria. Considering the neighborhood criterion, for each i ϵ N1 a j ϵ N0 should be chosen, subject 
to Expression 6.

3.3  Data and Variables 

The household level data come from the 2009 and 2013 PNAD/IBGE/Brazil. PNAD is an annually repeated 
household survey, which contains a nationally representative sample of more than 100,000 households each 
year. The PNAD’s Food Security Supplement, however, was taken just in the years 2004, 2009 e 2013, but 
due to the lack of some variables of interest; year 2004 was removed from the analysis. The final full sample 
10 

 

yield  approximately  228,170  observations  altogether.  In  addition  to  the  household’  and  individual’s 
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, the PNAD collects many others thematic questions related 
to migration and violence. 

In the PNAD, each household member is an observation, but this study only keeps the observations of the 
household heads. The PNAD was not designed to be representative below the state level; because of this, the 
fixed effects were used just at the state level. 

Table 2 summarizes the determinants of Food Insecurity (Food_Ins) considered in this work in terms of 
mean  or  proportion,  depending  on  if  it  is  a  continuous  or  categorical  variable,  respectively,  and  standard 
deviation.22 As can be seen, households are classified into 4 levels of food insecurity, depending on the result 
of the scale shown before. When all the household members have a regular and permanent access to food,23 it 
is said that the household has food security. The mild food insecurity level is for those household where there 
is some concern or uncertainty about the access to food and where quality has been diminished in order not to 
diminish  quantity.  The  moderate  level  is  attributed  for  those  households  where  food  quantity  has  been 
diminished  among  adults  or  there  was  a  rupture  in  the  alimentation  pattern.  And  finally  the  severe  food 
insecurity, that is associated with those cases in which the household members feel hungry, and at least one 
of them has gone for a whole day without food, due to lack of money.

The food insecurity measure used in this work is derived from the psychometric scale with 14 items of the 
PNAD’s survey, the Brazilian Scale of Food Insecurity (BSFI). The BSFI is an adapted and validated version 
of  that  proposed  by  the  Agricultural  Department  of  the  United  States.  According  to  Pérez-Escamilla  and 
Segall-Corrêa  (2008)  the  psychometric  scales  are  the  most  directly  related  to  the  lived  and  perceived 
experience of lack of food and have an excellent cost-effectiveness relation. They have been used since the 
years 1990 by several countries. 

The  questions  seek  to  capture  the  perception  of  the  household  experience  over  the  past  90  days  with 
regard to access to food (PNAD, 2010). The only possible responses are yes or no, whose values correspond 
to one and zero, respectively. The household’s score is  given by the simple sum of the values obtained  in 
each of the 14 questions, and the classification is according to Table 325.

The BFP is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 (BFP=1) if the household receives some cash transfer 
from the Program, or zero, if do not (BFP=0). However, while PNAD 2004 does provide direct information 
about  the  household’s  participation  in  the  BFP,  the  PNADs  2009  and  2013  do  not  provide  this  direct 
information.  So,  this  article  has  used  the  method  proposed  by  Souza  et  al.  (2011)26  to  estimate  it;  and  to 
certify  if  this  procedure  has  given  non-biased  results,  the  2004  estimations  (BFP)  were  compared  to  the 
households’ given responses in PNAD. Table 4 provides a summary of this comparison for the 104,572 valid 
observations of PNAD 2004.

Note: PNAD=1 means that the household’s head has answered yes when asked if she or he had received some benefits from the 
BFP, and PNAD=0 if he or she had answered no. BFP =1 means that the method used has estimated that the household is a 
beneficiary of the program, and BFP=0 otherwise. 

According to Table 4, the method worked pretty well: it recognized 93.9% of the beneficiaries who styled 
themselves  as  such;  and  among  those  designed  as  being  beneficiaries  by  the  method,  85.9%  self-declared 
beneficiaries.  On  the  other  hand,  the  method  recognized  as  non-beneficiaries  97.2%  of  those  who  have 
declared themselves as being non-beneficiaries, and among the non-beneficiaries estimated by the method, 
98.9%  have  recognized  they  didn’t  receive  some  benefit  from  the  Program.  On  average,  the  method  hit 
96.6%. 

A possible explanation for this combination of results could be the misreporting status by the households. 
As Bollinger and David (2001) have proved for the American case, the omission errors are more likely than 
the commission errors.

Table  5  summarizes  and  compares  the  proportion  of  the  beneficiary  (B)  and  non-beneficiary  (NB) 
households of the Bolsa-Familia Program by food insecurity situation for the full sample and for households 
below  and  above  the  poverty  line.  The  beneficiaries  represent  approximately  16.5%  of  the  full  sample 
(228,827  observations);  around  50.1%  of  households  below  the  poverty  line  (21,727  observations);  and 
43.9% of households below the extreme poverty line (9,631 observations).

The  proportion  of  households  that  are  food  secure  is  higher  among  the  non-beneficiaries  than  it  is  for  the 
program’s  beneficiaries  in  every  considered  sample  of  the  Table  5.  For  the  full  sample,  while  21.7%  of 
nonparticipating  households  are  food  insecure,  51.3%  of  BFP-beneficiaries  households  are  food  insecure. 
This result reveals that the Program has had a good focus, and that these households are perhaps more needy 
and more likely to self-select into BFP, as has been suggested by Ratclife et. al. (2011) for their own study. 

Data still show that even for the households with a per capita income four times higher than the poverty 
line,  Food_Ins  is  a  threat  to  23.1%  of  the  Program’s  beneficiaries  and  11.8%  of  non-beneficiaries.  And 
surprisingly, 50% of the extremely poor non-beneficiaries households are food secure. As Nord Andrews and 
Carlson (2004) have told, households find some strategies to deal with the lack of access to food. 

4.2  Estimations of the effect of the Bolsa-Familia Program (BFP) on Food Insecurity 

In order to test for robustness, three different models were estimated: pooled ordered logit and difference-in-
differences (with and without matching). The Table 6 brings the results for the impact of the Bolsa-Familia 
                                                           
27 Estimates were done with the sampling weight given by PNAD.

As it can be seen, the relation between the BFP and food insecutiry is positive in the pooled ordered logit but 
negative  in  the  diff-in-diff  models.  These  results  confirm  the  suspicion  that  there  is  an  endogeneus 
component in the analysis and that it has to be taken into account at the most appopriate way. 

Both  results  of  the  diff-in-diff  models  reveal  negative  impacts  of  the  program  on  food  insecurity,  even 
though in the matching model the size’s impact is quite small. But because it is expected that the matching 
method  bring  more  precision  to  the  the  diff-in-diff’s  results,  it  is  possible  that  the  diff-in-diff  without 
matching is overestimating the program’s impact. Table 7 presents the estimation results for both models.

4.3  The other determinants of Food Insecurity 

Table 8 brings the results for the parametric analysis of the diff-in-diff regression and the ordered logit 
model. All the variables were significant at 1% for both models. The coeficients signs were consistents  in 
both estimations, with the only exception of mar_status, that showed a positive effect on the ordered logit 
and negative on the diff-in-diff model. This variable was thought as a proxy to the household head’s marital 
status, but without worrying about the formal aspect of marriage. It only indicates whether the spouse (he or 
she) lives in the residence or not. Yen et al. (2008) and Depolt et al. (2009) found a negative coefficient, such 
as that estimated by the diff-in-diff model; i.e., living as a couple helps in reducing food insecurity.

Note: ***p≤0.01 

As was expected, the household asset variables ln_income, home_owner and auto_owner were negatively 
related  and  home_burd  positively  related  to  food  insecurity.  That  is,  the  stability  aids  in  driving  the  food 
decisions. However, the  share of income committed to the purchase or rental of the house where they live 
may not exceed 30% of family income. 

Households located at urban areas and in metrop_regions (metropolitan regions) were more propense to 
be food insecure. Because it is expected that in these places there is a greater availability of food, it would be 
expected a negative relationship. However, Hoffman (2008) and Gubert et al. (2010) have found the same 
positive relation concerning to urban areas when analizing Brazilian data. Production for own comsumption 
in  rural  areas  may  have  an  important  role  explaining  these  relation,  suggesting  a  closer  study  of  these 
differences in rural areas. 

Live  in  the  same  residence  for  less  than  ten  years  (reside)  was  thought  as  a  measure  of  social  capital, 
because  at  this  period  people  couldn’t  construct  more  deep  relationships.  It  was  expected  that  in  such 
circumstances the household members couldn’t have developed a social network, with trust and reciprocity, 
helping them in having access to food. In both model, households with less than 10 years of residence were 
more food insecure. 

The household’s head characteristics were important in determining food insecurity, which increases with 
age, until some point and then decreases; if the household’s head is a woman, or if s(he) is black, brown or 
indigenous.  All  these  types  of  behavior  are  similar  to  the  conducted  studies  for  the  US;  an  important 
difference, however, is the fact that in the US, the black and brown people represent a minority, whereas in 
Brazil they represent approximately 50.7% of the population according to the Census 2010. 

The  number  of  years  of  education  has  a  negative  relationship  with  food  insecurity,  meaning  that  the 
formal  schooling  system  helps  in  establishing  strategies  to  address  food  insecurity.  Similarly,  being 
employed and, more than that, being employed in a formal job, clearly contributes to reduce food insecurity.

Another  general  observation  noteworthy  is  the  fact  that  all  the  diff-in-diff’s  coefficients  were  smallers 

than the logit ordered’s coefficients. 

5  CONCLUSIONS 

This  article  examined  the  PNAD  repeated  cross-section  data  from  the  years  2009  and  2013  in  Brazil  and 
provided  evidences  that  the  Bolsa-Familia  Program  (BFP)  has  been  successful  in  diminishing  the 
households’ food insecurity (FI). However, the diff-in-diff with matching estimations showed that this impact 
is quite small, around -0.076. 

At the household level, food insecurity was seen as a four level measure: food security and mild, moderate 
and severe food insecurity. It was based in the subjective measure of the Brazilian psychometric scale of food 
insecurity, through which people recognize whether they had any difficulty in accessing food. 

Model’s robustness was tested through its comparison with ordered logit and diff-in-diff without matching 
models, showing that the results are quite consistent and that they can be biased if an identification strategy is 
not  used  in  the  analysis.  Without  taking  into  account  the  endogeneity,  a  positive  relationship  between  the 
BFP and FI is identified (ordered logit model), which becomes negative in the proposed diff-in-diff models. 
The  diff-in-diff  without  matching,  however,  captures  a  greater  impact  than  that  accomplished  with  the 
matching technique. But because it is supposed that the matching technique improves the estimation of the 
diff-in-diff model, it means that the diff-in-diff without matching overestimates the results. 

Some alternative ideas can be thought to explain this difference and the relative small program’s impacts. 
In this context, the analysis can be separated into two main lines: first by discussing the model limitations; 
and second, assuming the result as true, by nominating the possible problems in implementing the program. 

Behavioral differences between households with different levels of food insecurity or income can explain 
the  differences  between  the  two  diff-in-diff  models.  It  is  possible  that  a  quantile  model  can  solve  this 
problem and that the differences decrease with its use. Moreover, the difference between the differences of 
the  two  models  was  estimated  using  a  linear  model.  Perhaps  the  use  of  an  ordered  logit  would  be  more 
appropriate. 

On the program implementation, it must be remembered that there is no supervision over the money’s use, 
so that it may be being used for other purposes. In this regard, however, Duarte et al. (2009) and Almeida et 
al.  (2013)  identified  a  positive  impact  of  the  program  on  food  spending,  although  these  studies  cannot  be 
generalized at all. 

There may be a gap between the satiated hunger in the period and its perception as a permanent condition. 
In  addition,  scale  on  food  insecurity  reveals  an  absolute  condition  of  lack  of  resources  to  buy  food,  not  a 
comparison to a previous condition. Therefore, it  is possible that access  to food has been improved, but  a 
definitive solution has still not been achieved due to the small value of Program’s transfer.
