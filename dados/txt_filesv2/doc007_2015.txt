Abstract

Recently some economists have pointed out a dangerous process consisting of a loss of competitiveness in the Brazilian
industry caused by the strong exchange rate appreciation. However, others economists have linked this dangerous process
to the weakness performance of the Brazilian industrial productivity. In this context our paper evaluates the dierences
in the impact of exchange rate and labor productivity on the Brazilian market share of imports measured here by the
coecient of import penetration of total demand for manufacturing goods. Furthermore, we develop a simple micro model
for understanding under what conditions do these impacts diers. Empirically, we made use of a GMM panel data analysis
for 17 manufacturing sectors in the period among 1996 and 2011. Our results suggest that both variables matter to explain
the annual dierence of coecient of imports. Nevertheless, labor productivity has the highest negative impact on import's
market share even when the assessment is made in terms of groups of sectors.

Introduction

In the recent years, the competitiveness of the Brazilian manufacturing sector has become a prominent issue in
the national economic debate as a result of a rapid increase of the imports' participation on the domestic market
since the 90¬¥s. In 1996, imports represented only 6.5% of the domestic consumption of manufactured goods. This
participation soared during the 2000s, reaching 23.0% in 2008, with a small decline in 2011 to 19.5%. According to
several economists, policymakers and manufacturing associations, this large increase in the imports penetration is
to be blamed on the appreciation of the Real.

Indeed, after the 1999 crisis, the Brazilian currency (Real) appreciated in real terms (relative to U.S dollar) by
60 percent between 2003 and 2011. According to Armando Monteiro Neto, president of National Confederation of
Industries (CNI), appreciated exchange rate aects the competitiveness of the Brazilian manufacturing sector not
only abroad, but also inside the domestic market. Furthermore, more than 50% of all industrial segments in 2009
faced import competition (Monteiro, 2010).

Cano (2012) and Bresser-Pereira as well as Marconi (2010) also emphasize this aspect, suggesting that the level
of the exchange rate is the main factor behind the loss of competitiveness of the manufacturing sector observed
during the last decade, and warn that it could lead eventually to a process of deindustrialization.

There is no doubt that exchange rate has an important impact on the level of competitiveness in Brazilian
manufactured goods. According to Broz and Frieden (2006) a real appreciation of exchange rate increases the
purchasing power of local residents by lowering the relative price of foreign tradable goods. These authors also
emphasize that there is a trade-o between competitiveness and purchasing power and the exchange rate has a
crucial role in it.

However, it is important to point out that despite his importance exchange rate is not the only factor that explain
the loss of competitiveness of Brazilian manufactured goods. Productivity is also a key variable for understand
it. Bonelli and Pinheiro (2012) listed direct and indirect factors related to productivity that have constrained the
Brazilian competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. For instance, the quality of infrastructure, the investments
in R&D, absorption of foreign technology, labor cost and the educational level. As consequence, in terms of domestic
factors, not only is exchange rate the key for explaining the increase of import penetration but productivity is also a
crucial element. It is convenient to clarify, therefore, what is the factor that has a major role in import penetration
of the demand for manufactured goods.

This article evaluates the broad eect of exchange rate and productivity on the recent dynamic of import
penetration in the Brazilian demand for goods in the manufacturing sectors. Moreover, this paper elucidates which
factor has the greatest impact.

At rst time it is not clear why the impact of exchange rate and productivity on import penetration may
dier. Considering this aspect we propose a simply micro-funded model demonstrating that under some specic
conditions productivity measured by the ratio between industrial production and number of workers could be more
important for explaining the increase of import participation on domestic market when compared to exchange rate.
The necessary condition that creates this superior impact of labor productivity is a higher participation of foreign
inputs on the total production. This theoretical result reinforces the argument of Lisboa and Pessoa (2013) that
devaluations may protect national industry, but, at the same time, raises the costs of foreign inputs.

To corroborate empirically the dierence of impacts we made use of panel data regressions for 17 manufacturing
Brazilian sector covering a period between 1996 and 2011. By the fact that there is an eventual simultaneity between
labor productivity, exchange rate and import penetration yielding biased estimators, we apply GMM panel data
estimation based on Arellano and Bond (1991).

In particular this method takes the rst dierences of the variables to eliminate unobserved sector-specic eects
and use lagged instruments to correct for simultaneity. However, as pointed by literature, the lagged instruments
in the rst-dierence equation may be weak and may cause large nite-sample biases. To circumvent this problem
we also apply the system GMM panel estimation based on Arellano and Bover (1995) as well as Blundell and Bond
(1998).

In this context, our empirical ndings conrm that the impact of labor productivity on import penetration is
superior to exchange rate. These result contest the broad argument that exchange rate is the key factor that explain
the massive increase of imports on domestic market between 1996 and 2011. It is also possible to evaluate empirically
whether this result may be sustained by two distinct groups of sectors that constitute our data: consumption goods
sectors as well as intermediate and capital goods sectors. Findings also attest the superior importance of productivity
considering both groups of sectors.

In the case of consumption goods sectors group the impact of exchange rate on import penetration is slightly
superior when compared to the results for the whole sectors. On the other hand, the impact of exchange rate of
the group of intermediate and capital goods sectors is lower but not statistically signicant.

As a consequence these results support that fact that exchange rate is not crucial for explaining the increase of
imports participation on the domestic demand for intermediate and capital goods. This last result is important in
terms of policy given that devaluation of Brazilian currency may not be eective for increase the market share of
local intermediate and capital goods on the domestic market.

The rest of the paper is organized as follow. Section 2 presents some stylized facts about the relationship between
import penetration and labor productivity and real exchange rate. Section 3 presents the micro-funded model that
supports the theoretical view about the importance of productivity over exchange rate. Section 4 and 5 present,
respectively, the empirical model and results. Finally section 6 concludes this article.

2 Stylized facts: exchange rate, productivity and import penetration

The recent process of rapid increase of manufacturing imports in the Brazilian domestic consumption became a
relevant issue in the economic debate and exchange rate has turned out to be the key factor for understand it.
There are two mainly reasons for that. At rst place, economic theory expects that the relationship between import
penetration, measured by the share of imports over the manufacturing apparent consumption, and exchange rate
is negative. In general, there is evidence that Brazilian imports react positively when home currency appreciates

2

against major foreign currencies. Secondly, over the last 20 years, real exchange rate appreciation reached its lowest
level. However, despite of the fact that these arguments gained importance on the national debate, there is some
aspects related to this process that remains unclear, i.e., the degree of import penetration sensitiveness to exchange
rate evaluated at sector level.

A preliminary and basic view of these relationship reveals that the correlation is negative as expected, but
with a small degree. Figure 1(a) presents the dispersion between the log dierence of the share of imports in the
domestic market (measured by import penetration coecient calculated at constant prices) and the log dierence
of sectoral exchange rate1 for 17 manufacturing sectors, during the period between 1997 and 2011. As we observe,
the linear relationship is weak and the correlation coecient is only -0.06. This characteristic is consequence of
the low correlation in the group of intermediate and capital goods sectors. Figure 1(c) reveals that those sectors
relationship between these two variables is slightly positive and near zero. Whereas the sectors of consumption
good industries, as shown in Figure 1(b), has a pronounced relationship and presents a higher degree correlation
with a coecient of -0.21.

Figure 1: Dispersion between the annual dierence of the import coecient (vertical axis) and the annual growth
rate of sectoral exchange rate (horizontal axis) for 17 manufacturing sectors between 1997-2011.

Furthermore, these stylized fact puts in check the eectiveness of devaluation policies for protecting the national
manufacturing industry. The exchange rate appears to be important for reducing import penetration in the consumer
goods sector. However, this is not true in the case of intermediate and capital goods import penetration. Whether
import penetration coecient of intermediate and capital goods sectors is indeed inelastic to the exchange rate,
currency devaluations elevate input costs and make new investments more expensive.

According to Lisboa and Pessoa (2013) the eect of the exchange rate is ambiguous. Devaluations may protect
national industry, but, at the same time, raises the costs of imported inputs. Because of these ambiguity, Broz

of exchange rate.

In this sense, it is possible that the existence of manufacturing imported goods that are used as input in the
national industry decreases the sensitiveness of import penetration for all industry to the exchange rate. In fact,
intermediate and capital goods sectors, in general, has a level of imported input participation on total inputs
superior than consumption goods sectors. According to the databases of input-output matrix estimated by dierent
authors for the period between 2000-2009 (Freitas et all 2012; Guilhoto and Sesso Filho, 2010; Martinez, 2015)
the sectors present in these group has, on average, a participation of around 16% imported inputs in total inputs
demanded in nal production against a percentage of 8.0% in the consumption goods sectors.

On the other hand, some economists have explained the recent raise of import penetration by emphasizing the role
of productivity performance (Bonelli and Pessoa, 2010; Ferreira and Fragelli, 2011). According to Lisboa and Pessoa
(2013), while certain sectors in the decade of 2000 were favored by labor productivity gains, for example, agriculture,
most of the manufacturing industry sectors showed a poor performance. Using data from IBGE manufacturing
survey (PIM-IBGE), between the years of 2003 and 2011, a period of intense appreciation of the real exchange rate,
the industry labor productivity increase only 21%. In particular, labor productivity performance in intermediate
and capital goods sector presented a cumulative growth of 18%, while the sectoral exchange rate appreciated 57%.
Whether these segments of economists are correct, we expect that the relationship between import penetration
and productivity would be negative and high correlated. Therefore Figure 2(a) presents the dispersion between the
log dierence of import penetration and the log dierence of labor productivity for all sectors highlighted here. In
fact, a preliminary analysis of the data in Figure 2 reveals that the relationship between these variables are strongly
negative. The correlation coecient is -0.57 for the group of 17 sectors. The same occurs with the two groups of
sectors as seen by Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c). In the case of intermediate and capital goods sector the correlation
coecient is -0.65 and for consumption good sector its value is -0.40.

raising in import penetration of manufacturing goods. The stylized facts presented here reveal that this dierence
may be related to the presence of intermediate and capital goods imports. Apparently, these group of sectors
do not present any association between import penetration and exchange rate. As a consequence it weakens the
relationship for the whole manufacturing sector. We have the impression that the absence of association in this
specic group may be explained by deeply structural dependence of foreign inputs in the domestic production when
compared to consumption good sectors.

As we may see in the next section, the hypothesis that foreign input dependence weakens exchange rate impact
is reasonable when analyzed through a simple micro-funded model. In empirical terms, it is not possible to draw
robust conclusions by a simple analysis of correlation. The reverse causality between variables and unobserved
sectoral and time eects may be a problem. Furthermore, import penetration may also depend on other important
factors as we could see in the theoretical model. Thus, all theses aspects demand dierent econometric treatments.

3 Theoretical Model

This section proposes a simple theoretical model in order to motivate and discuss the main propositions to be tested
in this paper. We assume that there are two countries, a domestic and a foreign country, and that the production
function of domestic and foreign rms are given, respectively, by:

(1)
where Y and Y ‚àódenote the quantities produced in each country and Œ± and Œ±‚àórepresent the labor productivity in
the domestic and foreign industries. We assume that the labor supply is inelastic, so that the L and L‚àóare both
exogenous variables. Given the price of the domestic good (in national currency), P , the rm's prot is given by:

Y = Œ±L and Y ‚àó = Œ±‚àóL‚àó

œÄ = P Œ±L ‚àí wL

(2)

where w is the nominal wage. Assuming that there is free entry in the industry, the prot of all active rms should
be zero. Therefore, the equilibrium price is given by:

P =

w
Œ±

(3)

Note that the term w
good (in foreign currency) is given by: P ‚àó = w‚àó
Œ±‚àó .

Œ± represents the unit labor cost. Similarly, we have that the equilibrium price of the foreing

Next, suppose that the domestic demand for both the domestic and foreign goods can be derived based on the

choices of a representative consumer with CES utility function given by:

U (Q, Q‚àó) = (QœÅ + Q‚àóœÅ)1/œÅ

(4)
where œÅ ‚â§ 1 is the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. Suppose also that the representative
consumer has income R > 0, which he spends all in consumption. Suppose, without loss of generality, that R = 1,
so that his budget constraint is given by:

(5)
where E is the nominal exchange rate. The consumer chooses Q and Q‚àóin order to maximize (5) subject to (6).
The solution to this problem yields the following relationship between the quantitites consumed in equilibrium of
the foreign and domestic goods:

P Q + EP ‚àóQ‚àó ‚â§ 1

=

Œ±
Ew‚àó
Œ±‚àó

,

(6)

i.e. the participation of imported goods in the domestic market, Q‚àó
Q , depends on the ratio between the unit labor
cost of foreign and domestic rms. Specically, a reduction in the unit labor cost of the domestic rms, i.e. an
improvement in the competitiveness of the national industry, leads to a decrease in the local demand for the foreign
good relative to domestic good. Moreover, note that the above equation can be re-expressed as:

Thus, it follows that a 1% exchange rate depreciation has the same impact on Q‚àó

economists who argue that domestic competitiveness can be improved by simply engendering an exchange rate
depreciation. But does this result make sense? How robust is it?

According to Lisboa and Pessoa (2013), exchange rate depreciation increases the competitiveness of the domestic
industry, but at the same time raise the cost of imported inputs. The model presented above does not capture such
adverse eects of exchange rate depreciation due to the simplistic format assumed for the production function of
domestic rms. In order to make our analysis more realistic, we extend the previous model, now assuming that the
production function of domestic rms are given by a Leontief function of the following form:

Y = Œ±.min

L,

with œÜ > 0,

(8)

where Œπ is the quantity of an imported input used in the domestic production, i.e. we are now assuming that the
production of the domestic good requires the use of a certain quantity of a foreign production factor. Note that the
optimal production requires that:

Œπ = œÜL

(9)

since any other combination of production factors would imply in waste of resources. Note that the larger the value
of the parameterœÜ, the higher the dependence of the domestic industry on the foreign input. Assuming, without
loss of generality, that the price of the imported production factor is equal to one and imposing the optimality
condition Œπ = œÜL, it follows that the prot of domestic rms is given by:

œÄ = P Œ±L ‚àí (w + œÜE) L

(10)

Thus, from the zero prot condition, it follows that the equilibrium price of the domestic good is now given by:

P =

w + œÜE

Œ±

(11)

Finally, assuming, for simplicity, that both the production structure of the foreign industry and the utility
function of the representative consumer remain unchanged, we have that, in equilibrium, the ratio between the
demanded quantities of foreign and domestic goods is given by:

which can be re-expressed as:

(13)

Thus, as long asœÜ > 0, the eect of an increase in labor productivity on the relative demand for the foreign good,
Q‚àó
Q , is larger (in absolute terms) than that of an exchange rate depreciation. Formally, we have that:

Thus, it follows that the eectiveness of a policy of currency devaluation in terms of improving the competitiveness
of the domestic industry depends crucially on the production structure of domestic rms and, in particular, on the
degree to which they rely on the use of imported inputs.

4 Empirical Model

In order to observe whether the eects of productivity labor and exchange rate indeed dier, as expected by the
theoretical model, we estimate the elasticities related to each variable in the equation (13). Dierent from the
model in the last section, our empirical analysis requires additional treatment. Firstly, the data consist of annual
information for manufacturing sectors considering a specic period. Thus, it is necessary to control for unobserved
sectoral eect and time eects that is not treated in the micro model. Secondly, disturbances may be possibly
autorregressive given that import penetration shocks may have persistent eect over the years. Third, the ratio
between the demand of foreign and domestic goods is proxied by the coecient of import penetration. By the end,
due to the impossibility of obtaining foreign wage data for the highlighted period, we assume that these variables
are captured by xed and time eects.

The empirical model, therefore, is considered by the following expression:

ipt = Œ≤Œ±Œ±it + Œ≤EEit + Œ≤wwit + Œ≤Œ±‚àóŒ±‚àó

vit = Œ¥vit‚àí1 + Œµit |Œ¥| < 1 Œµit ‚àº i.i.d

it + Œ≥t + (¬µi + vit)

(17)

where, ipit is the log of coecient of import penetration i in the year t, Œ±it is log of domestic labor productivity,
Eit is the log of eective exchange rate, wit is log of domestic manufacturing wages by sector, Œ±it is the log of a
proxy for foreign labor productivity, Œ≥t is time eect. Of the error components, ¬µi is the xed eect and vit is an
autorregressive shock.

The presence of persistent shocks vit indicate that model (1) may also be described by a dynamic representation

according to the following expression:

ipit = œÄ1ipit‚àí1 + œÄ2Œ±it + œÄ3Œ±it‚àí1 + œÄ4Eit + œÄ5Eit‚àí1 + œÄ6wit + œÄ7wit‚àí1

+œÄ8Œ±‚àó

it + œÄ9Œ±‚àó

(18)
where, œÄ1 = Œ¥, œÄ2 = Œ≤Œ±, œÄ3 = ‚àíŒ¥Œ≤Œ±, œÄ4 = Œ≤E, œÄ5 = ‚àíŒ¥Œ≤E, œÄ6 = Œ≤w, œÄ7 = ‚àíŒ¥Œ≤w, œÄ8 = Œ≤Œ±‚àó, œÄ9 = ‚àíŒ¥Œ≤Œ±‚àó,
ÀúŒ≥t = Œ≥t ‚àí Œ¥Œ≥t‚àí1 and Àú¬µi = ¬µi(1 ‚àí Œ¥). The model (2) is the unrestricted model that has a dynamic process that
includes a autorregressive component of the import penetration coecient. These aspect associated to the possibility
of reverse causality between variables demand a method of estimation dierent from Ordinary Least Squared (OLS)
and Fixed Eect (FE). The OLS estimator is inconsistent estimator given that ipit‚àí1 is correlated to the error term
due to the presence of the xed eect. Hence, the estimator tend to be biased upward.

it‚àí1 + ÀúŒ≥t + Àú¬µi + Œµit

On the other hand, the FE estimator corrects this inconsistency by removing the xed eect. However, it
promotes a non-negligible correlation between the transformed autorregressive component of dependent variable
and the transformed error term. In addition, OLS and FE estimators do not eliminate the problems of inconsistency
generated by reverse causality between variables. Notice that the error term may be also correlated to the others
variables, for example, shocks in import penetration may contemporaneously inuence labor productivity given
that both variables were constructed from the value of industrial production. Furthermore, the eective exchange
rate variable Eit is calculated by weighing up real exchange rate of Brazilian trade partners and their participation
on the total of imports. Needless to say that real wage may be strongly correlated to the labor productivity. Thus,
given those aspects, it is possible that reverse causality may also be a problem in terms of estimation consistency.
In this sense, we also estimate the coecients of equation (2) by Arellano and Bond (1991) or rst-dierenced
Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). This method yields consistent estimators for dynamic panel models. It
relaxes the hypothesis of strong exogeneity of variables assuming that they are endogenous, i.e., the variables are
correlated to the shocks in t and previous shocks. However, they are not correlated to forward shocks. Assuming
that, it is possible to use the sequence of lags of the variables in level as instruments, after taking the equation in
rst dierence to eliminate the xed eect.

However, the estimator proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) may have lagged instruments that is weakly
correlated with subsequent rst dierences variables. This is a case of weak instruments that may cause bias as
well as imprecision when explanation variables are very persistent. According to Bond (2002) it happens when the
estimated autorregressive coecient of the dependent variable in rst-dierenced GMM is near to the within groups
coecient. Blundell and Bond (1998) achieve this result by simulation exercises revealing that, when instruments
are weak, rst-dierenced GMM results tend to be biased in the direction of within group estimation.

To solve this problem, Arellano and Bover as well as Blundell and Bond (1998) suggest additional moment
conditions by using lagged rst-dierenced instruments for the equation in levels. The system GMM method,
therefore, combines lagged level as instruments in the rst-dierenced equation with lagged rst dierences variables
as instruments in the level equation. Hence, it is expected that system GMM may cause a dramatic reduction of
nite sample bias.

7

However, our interest lies in the restricted parameters (Œ≤Œ±, Œ≤E, Œ≤w, Œ≤Œ±‚àó , Œ¥). Given the estimated coecients in (2)
and the system of equation originated by the autorregressive shocks process, we estimate the restricted parameters
by minimum distance method suggested by Blundell, Bond and Meghir (1996).

In possession of these results, we may verify whether our empirical ndings are in concordance with the theoretical

model discussed previously.

5 Data

Our data covers the period between 1996 and 2011 as well as 17 manufacturing sectors classied in Table 1. It
yields 255 observations. Apart from information about Brazilian manufacturing sectors, our empirical analysis also
demands information from its foreign trade partners.

The sources of trade partner's information are: World Bank Database (consumer index price and exchange rate)
as well as Penn World Table (GDP at chained PPPs and the number of employees). The manufacturing data are
obtained from Monthly Manufacturing Survey from Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography  PIM/IBGE
(index of the number of employees associated to production.
index of real payroll per worker and manufacturing
production index). Annual Manufacturing Survey from Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography PIA-IBGE
(number of employees associated to production and manufacturing value of production) and Aliceweb (Brazilian
imports and exports by sector).

From this data we constructed four variables present in the theoretical model: import penetration coecient,
real eective exchange rate, Brazilian labor productivity and an index of foreign productivity. Additionally, the
real payroll index, also provided by IBGE, served as a proxy for real wage.

The import coecient was conventionally constructed as the ratio of imported value and the apparent con-
sumption. The latter consists of the sum of the industrial production value and imports value subtracted from the
exports. All measures are expressed in terms of constant prices.

The proposed real eective exchange rate is calculated by weighting the real exchange rate (R$ / LCU) of
the trading partners in relation to their participation on the total imports of all 17 manufacturing sectors. The
construction of real exchange rate is based on consumer prices2.

Labor productivity was built from the ratio of the value of industrial production, at 2006 prices, and the number
of employees. We also propose a foreign productivity index as a proxy for trade partner's sector labor productivity.
In a similar way to eective real exchange rate, this variable is constructed by weighting the labor productivity of
trading partners in relation to their import's share on the total imports of all sectors.

A detailed description of these variables is following described considering i as a indication of manufacturing

sector and t for year.

¬à ipit = log(importsit / (industrial production valueit + importsit ‚àí exportsit)

¬à Œ±it = log(industrial production valueit/number of employees associated to productionit)
¬à Eit = log(real exchangerate (R$/LCU )t √ó the import's share of trading partners on the total importsit)
¬à Œ±‚àó

it = log(trading partners labor productivityt √ó the import's share of trading partners on the total importsit)

2The real exchange rate is calculated for each trading partner through the ratio of the country's consumer price indexes and the

Brazilian consumer price index.

A descriptive statistics of the variables, given by Table 2, reinforces the stylized facts about the relationship between
import penetration, exchange rate and productivity. The average coecient of import penetration, in the period
between 1996 and 2011, was 10.6%. Note, however, that its average growth rate was 7% per year reecting a
substantial increase of manufacturing imports participation on domestic consumption. It is a similar result when
compared to the two large groups of sectors (consumptions goods as well as intermediate and capital goods).

Otherwise, the average rate of the annual labor productivity did not strictly follow the import penetration
performance. Considering all sectors, its growth rate was only 0.7% per year. For the sectors of consumption goods,
the percentage is even lower, equal to 0.2%, whereas the group of intermediate and capital sectors had an annual
growth rate of 1.1%.

Real eective exchange rate, by the other hand, had a distinct dynamic. As we may see, Brazilian currency
strongly appreciated, in real terms, against the currencies of its trading partners. In average, the annual rate was
-3.3% for all sectors. Considering the group of consumption goods sectors this rate is even inferior, reaching -4.8%
per year.

Note that these facts are also compatible with the discussion presented in section 2. The increase of import
penetration seems to be related to the low performance of productivity in manufacturing sectors and the trajectories
appreciation of the exchange rate.

On the other hand, additional aspects deserve attention and may also be important for explaining the advance
of import penetration in domestic consumption. The index of foreign productivity indicates that the partners had
a better performance in terms of labor productivity. In general, the annual average growth rate for all sectors was
about 2.0%. Even when segmented by the two broad groups of sectors the performance per year continues to be
practically the same.

By the end, it is seems that wages do not have a large inuence on the recent diusion of imports on domestic
market. It is expected that real wage would have had an increase in this period impacting negatively the Brazilian
manufacturing competitiveness favoring imports. However, the average growth rate of our proxy for real wage was
near zero. Specically for the group of intermediate and capital goods sectors, the annual rate was nevertheless
negative.

6 Empirical Results

The restricted model described by equation (1) and the unrestricted model (2) are estimated by dierent methods.
The estimation of (1) made use of four approaches in order to evaluate whether the results is inuenced by the
presence of some specic bias as discussed before: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Fixed Eect (FE), GMM in
dierences (DIFF-GMM) proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) as well as System GMM (SYS-GMM) proposed
by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Bover and Blundell (1998). After that, the method of minimum distance is
applied for estimating the structural elasticities (2) through the coecients obtained from unrestricted models.

In the rst part of Table 3 we present the estimation of unrestricted models coecients considering 17 sectors.
We estimate a total of ten models. All models include year dummies for controlling time eects. The rst two
columns present the estimation by OLS and FE. In the following columns we report the coecients estimated
by GMM. The dierence between them basically lies in the number of system equation and the composition of
instrumental variables.

Notes:
(i) DIFF-GMM indicates that the models is GMM in dierences and SYS-GMM indicates that models is system GMM.
(ii) the models in columns 3 and 7 include t ‚àí 2 and earlier lags as instruments and models in columns 4 and 8 include as instruments t ‚àí 3 and earlier lags.
(iii) the models in columns 5 and 9 include t ‚àí 2 and earlier lags as instruments in equation in dierences and t ‚àí 1 as instruments in the equation in level.
(iv) the models in columns 6 and 10 include t ‚àí 2 and earlier lags as instruments in equation in dierences and t ‚àí 1 as instruments in the equation in level, with
exception of labor productivity variables where we consider t ‚àí 2 as instrument in equation in levels.

In the case of the models among the third and six columns we consider the micro-model hypothesis.

It is
assumed that the real eective exchange rate and the foreign labor productivity index are exogenous, i.e., there is
no sequence of lag instruments related to these variables in the rst dierence equation as well as in the equation
in levels when the SYS-GMM is considered.

However, the construction of these two variables, as discussed earlier, involves measures that may be correlated

11

to the others variables. The exogeneity of trading partner's exchange rate and their labor productivity, that are
used for constructing the variables, is less controversial especially because we are dealing with a level analysis based
in manufacturing sectors. Thus, we expect that sector shocks on Brazilian import penetration do not inuence
contemporaneous partner's exchanges rates and labor productivity. However, despite of this fact, these two variables
also depends on the trading partners import's participation on total sector imports that may impose simultaneity
bias. For this reason, the models in columns 7 to 10 consider all variable in the system as endogenous.

Furthermore, the composition of instruments is also changed according to the sequence of lags. It may inuence
the validity of instruments as reported by Sargan test of over-identifying restriction, shown in the second part of
In the DIFF-GMM models of the columns 4 and 8, we impose the structure of lags inferior to t3 in
Table 3.
the equation in rst dierence. Taking into account SYS-GMM, we do not change the sequence of instruments in
the rst dierence equation, imposing lags dated t2 and earlier. However, in the level equation, the lags of labor
productivity (‚àÜlog(Œ±it)) instruments is changed from t1 to t2.

In this context, the estimation of all unrestricted models reveals rstly that there is no problem of residual serial
correlation in lag 2. The null hypothesis is rejected at 10% validating the assumption that import penetration shocks
may be described by an autoregressive process. However, the Sargan tests indicate that there is poor evidence that
instruments are valid in DIFF-GMM models even when the composite of instruments is dated to t3 and earlier.
The null hypothesis that instruments are valid is rejected at conventional levels. In addition, our results also suggest
that these instruments are weak.

According to Bond (2002) when the estimated lag coecient of dependent variable in DIFF-GMM models is near
to the same coecient estimated by FE give us evidence that instruments are highly persistence or close to random
walk processes. As discussed in section 4, it may generate downward bias on the estimator. On the other hand,
SYS-GMM exploits additional moment conditions by using lagged rst dierences as instruments for the equations
in levels. As a result, the autoregressive coecient of dependent variable is higher and lies between FE and OLS
estimator as predicted by Bond (2002).
In general, OLS estimator gives an upward bias on the autoregressive
coecient of dependent variable by the presence of sector-specic eect.

Generally, our SYS-GMM estimation model improves the power of Sargan tests. Nevertheless, only two models
reported in columns 7 and 8 of Table 3 have a p-value superior than 10%. Furthermore, the dierence Sargan
test reveals that additional rst dierence instruments present in SYS-GMM models are valid at level superior to
10%. Note further that the most improvement on p-value of Sargan test occurs when we change the lag of labor
productivity rst dierence instruments to t2 in level equation.
In light of this econometrics aspects, unrestricted model estimated by SYS-GMM appear to be reasonable,
especially in the case where Eit and y‚àó
it are assumed to be endogenous. It may be explained by the presence of
simultaneous correlation between import penetration variable and trading partners import's participation on total
sector imports used as a weight in Eit and y‚àó

it construction.

Despite of the fact that the last SYS-GMM model in Table 3 is preferred to the model in column 6, it does
not impact decisively the coecients of restricted model. Dierent from unrestricted models, they are estimated
by minimum distance method as proposed by Bond (2002). Only the coecient associated to the real wage has
changed, but not in expressive magnitude. Thus, regardless the assumption that is made about Eit and y‚àó
it, it
does not inuence our conclusion about the impact of exchange rate and labor productivity on import penetration.
Furthermore, according to COMFAC test, presented in the end of the Table 3, the restrictions imposed by minimum
distance estimation are easily accepted.

As predicted by the micro-model, the impact of domestic labor productivity on import penetration is negative
and superior to exchange rate. Considering only the SYS-GMM models, the value of productivity coecient is
at least three times larger than the exchange rate coecients.
It is the preliminary evidence supported by the
micro-model, i.e., the presence of foreign inputs in the domestic production implies that labor productivity play a
superior role in import penetration when compared to eective real exchange rate.

Some additional aspects of results deserve attention. Our real wage proxy estimator is signicant and as expected
has a positive impact on import penetration. In absolute terms, its impact is also superior to the of exchange rate.
More interesting is the fact that the index of foreign labor productivity has the highest impact on the import
penetration. Generally, the estimated elasticity is superior to the unity while domestic labor productivity has a
value near to 0.8. Considering the last model, the ratio between domestic and foreign labor productivity elasticity
is around 0.56, a representative percentage.

Our argument that foreign inputs matters to explain why exchange rate is less important than labor productivity
lies in the fact that the participation of intermediate and capital goods in the domestic market is inelastic to eective
exchange rate of the sector. At the moment that national manufacturing industry is deeply dependent of some foreign
goods for producing, it is less likely that changes in the exchange rate may aect their consumption in domestic
market. It seems the case of intermediate and capital sectors. Table 4 presents the model estimation for these group
that includes 10 sectors. We impose the exactly structure of lags for instrumental variables presented in all sectors

Our estimated models related to these group have also evidenced that lagged instruments are weak in rst

13

dierence equation on the method of GMM in dierences given that coecient of dependent variable is near to the
xed eect coecient. On the other hand, Sargan tests do not indicate that the over-identifying restrictions are
valid for all GMM models. Additionally, dierence Sargan test also reveals that additional moment condition used
in system GMM is accepted at 10% level.

All this aspects reveals that system GMM again yields preferable estimates. However, dierent from all sectors
models, the composition of instruments may change considerably the results of restricted models. Notice that,
the validity of the restrictions imposed by minimum distance estimation is conditioned to it. Basically the model
that only accepts the imposed restriction is the model in column 6. In that case, we assume that Eit and y‚àó
it are
exogenous variables.

Even if we take account the last model described in column 10 where the structure of lags is identical to the
model in column 6, but all variables are considered endogenously, there are no substantial changes on the mainly
results. The domestic productivity impact is signicant and negative. The estimated coecient of the foreign
productivity index is positive and signicant at 10% level and again has the largest impact among variables. The
unique dierence is related to the proxy of wage coecient that is not signicant in the model described in column
6.

The relevant aspect is the fact that although exchange rate impact is negative as expected, its coecient is
not signicant at 10% level. It is means that import penetration of the intermediate and capital good sectors is
insensitive to the exchange rate. This explain why, when we consider all manufacturing sectors, exchange rate has
a limited impact on import penetration coecient when compared to the labor productivity.

Notice that, although the fact that the impact of exchange rate is inelastic for these group of sectors is an
important empirical nding and reveals that the presence of imported inputs may explain this aspect, it does not
conrm that the second order eect of the theoretical model is valid. The conrmation that imported input is
relevant for explaining the dierential of labor productivity and exchange rate impacts demands that, additionally,
the exchange rate elasticity have to be conditioned to the the some measure for the ratio of imported inputs on total
inputs used in these sectors. In empirical terms, it means that we also should incorporate to the model a variable
that is the interaction between exchange rate and the imported input ratio measure. Consequently, it is expected
that the coecient of these interaction will be positive, i.e., as long as imported input ratio increases it necessarily
reduces the impact of exchange rate on the import penetration.

Table 5 presents the results of the restricted models3 and include in its specication the interaction between
eective real exchange rate variable and the ratio between the total value of imported input and the value of total
inputs (domestic and imported) used in the production by the sector as a whole obtained by input-output matrices
data estimated by three dierent sources, Freitas et al (2012), Guilhoto and Sesso Filho (2010) and Martinez (2015).
All authors estimate the input-output matrices for the period among 2000 and 2009 for several sectors inclusive
those treated here. Only the matrices of 2000 and 2005 are ocial and provided by IBGE. The imported input
ratio œÜi therefore is computed as the average of the available ratios, thus, it means that it is xed along the years
and varies according to the sector 4.

According to the tests of adequacy associated to unrestricted models in Table 5 we may not nd further prob-
lems related to serial correlation as well as problems related to the validity of instruments. Again, SYS-GMM
demonstrated being the preferable model given that the p-values of Di-Sargan tests reveals that the hypothesis of
additional set of instruments is not rejected.

In general, the addition of the variable of interaction do not change considerably the impacts of other variables
specially the dierential of elasticity between domestic labor productivity and exchange rate. Otherwise, the models
estimated by data from Guilhoto and Sesso Filho (2010) tend to overestimate the coecient of interaction as shown
in columns 3 and 6 as well as it makes the real wage coecient insignicant in the former model. Nevertheless,
the COMFAC test reveals that the imposed restriction is not valid for these models as well as for all models that
consider exchange rate and foreign labor productivity as exogenous variables.

On the other hand, COMFAC tests also reveals that imposed restriction is accepted for models that consider
exchange rate and foreign labor productivity as endogenous and make use of input-output matrices database from
Freitas et al (2012) and Martinez (2015). Interesting to note that the results are practically identical between the
two models.

That said, through the results of Table 5 it is possible to conrm our preliminary hypothesis that the reduced
elasticity of exchange rate on import penetration is related to the participation of imported input on the total

3To save space the estimated coecients of unrestricted model that are estimated by SYS-GMM is not shown on Table 5.
4Our option for using a xed imported input ratio based on the avarage ratios of the period among 2000 and 2009 is explained by
the fact that there is no input-output matrix estimation for 2010 and 2011. Furthermore, despite the fact that Guilhoto and Sesso Filho
(2010) have estimated input-output matrix for the rst 4 years (1996-1999), they just only cover 13 sectors. Given this aspects, we have
prefered to proxied imported input ratio by a xed value along all the period in analysis than lose precious information related to the
sectors and time.

inputs. As expected, the coecient of the interaction between eective real exchange rate and input imported ratio
by sector (Œ≤E√óœÜ) is positive and signicant for all models. Thus, a higher level of imported inputs ratio in a specic
sector implies that exchange rate is less sensitive to import penetration. For instance, the sectors of consumption
goods, on average, has an imported input ratio of about 0.08 meaning that the elasticity of exchange rate is near
to -0.21 considering models in column 4 e 5. On the other hand, the group of intermediate and capital good sectors
has a ratio of 0.16. As a consequence, the elasticity of exchange rate is near zero, equal to -0.04, a much smaller
value than the group of consumption goods. It is in line with the results of Table 4 where the elasticity of exchange
rate is small and statistically non-signicant. In fact, the level of imported inputs ratio matters for explaining the
dierential of elasticities.

Notice that when the imported inputs ratio is null, the inuence of exchange rate on penetration coecient is
still lower than the impact of labor productivity. Considering again the model in column 4, even when the imported
inputs ratio is zero the elasticity of exchange rate is -0.386 against -0.799 from labor productivity, i.e., the values
diers.

At rst moment, these aspect does not invalidate our results though it means that could exist other factors that
inuence the sensitiveness of exchange rate on import penetration than the participation of imported input in total
input used in the nal production. In this sense, we just only conrm that the presence of imported inputs on
production partially inuence the impact the exchange rate and most relevant in substantial way.

Furthermore, it is important to point out that although theoretical model predicts that those elasticities have
the same magnitude, it depends on the functional form that we initially assume. Thus, what is important here is
that our empirical ndings are in accordance with the mainly results of the micro model that is independent of
initial conditions, i.e., the signs of all estimated elasticities is coherent with the theory and that imported input
ratio matters for explaining the dierential of impacts between exchange rate and labor productivity.

7 Final Considerations and Policy Analysis

According to our empirical ndings labor productivity is more important than exchange rate for explaining import
penetration given the period in the recent years. This aspect conrms the view supported by Bonelli and Pessoa
(2010) and Ferreira and Fragelli (2011) that the recent progress of imports on Brazilian domestic market is broadly
related to the productivity. As we presented before, labor productivity elasticities are considerably superior to the
elasticity of exchange rate. The eect of domestic labor productivity on import penetration is at least three times
larger than the exchange rate, a huge dierence. Foreign labor productivity, on the other hand, has the prevalent
inuence indicating that there are other distinguished aspects that helps to explain the presence of imported goods
on domestic market that do not depend on national economic policies.

Most important is that the dierential of impacts is a consequence of the inelasticity of exchange rate to the
coecient of imports from intermediate and capital goods sectors. These inelasticity is supported by the fact that
intermediate and capital goods sectors group have a higher level of imported inputs in the nal production. Our
results revealed that exchange rate elasticity is lower as higher is the participation of imports in the total inputs of
the sector.

The consequences of the reduced exchange rate eectiveness may be observed when we make an exercise of
simulation by using the coecients estimated from unrestricted model described in the last column of Table 3.
We have simulated trajectories of productivity and exchange rate that is required to generate dierent import
penetration scenarios considering the period after 2003. As we said before it is a distinct period and deserves
attention because exchange rate suered an intense process of appreciation of about 62%. Associated to this,
Brazilian manufacturing labor productivity had a poor growth performance. A combination of huge appreciation
with poor productivity performance promoted a massive increase of imports on domestic market.

Scenario 1 consists of forecasts of average levels of import penetration for 2004-2011 considering a constant
annual growth rate for labor productivity of 2.5% and of 0% for exchange rate. Scenario 2 is the opposite, i.e., a
constant annual growth of 0% for labor productivity and 2.5% for exchange rate. In all scenarios we made use of
the observed wage and foreign labor productivity indexes series for the period as well as the estimated xed eect.
The statistics of the simulations are shown in Table 6.

As expected, when we impose the same annual growth rate for both variables considering scenarios where the
opposite variable is xed during all the period, the average level of import penetration is lower when domestic labor
productivity has a positive and constant growth. In these hypothetical scenario the dierence in terms of average
levels of import penetration is about 1.4% and 2.7% in terms of nal value.

Otherwise, it is also interesting to calibrate the labor productivity or exchange rate path that is necessary to
reach some specic average level of import penetration. This is an important feature in terms of policy. In other
words, given that government has two variables of policy it should nd out what are more ecient for reducing the

participation of manufacturing imports on domestic market. This is the case of further scenarios.

Scenarios 3 and 4 are assumed respectively that labor productivity as well as exchange rate are exogenous and
have a constant annual growth rate that is enough to generate an average level of import penetration compatible
with a 2003 value, i.e., a mean of 0.11 (a target of 11% in the import penetration index) for the period between
2004 and 2011. It means an reduction superior than 1 percentage point in the actual import penetration average
level of 0.123. In the case of Scenario 3 where no restriction on the exchange rate growth rate is imposed it was
necessary that labor productivity should have had a constant growth of 4.5% per year. When we execute the same
exercise considering now only exchange rate as the policy variable it would be necessary a annual appreciation rate
of only 4.0% per year for achieving the 2003 imports participation target as we observe in the results of scenario 4.
Imposing a more constrained scenarios, i.e., an average level target of 1996-2003 in import penetration (8.8
percentage points), the labor productivity growth should had been 11.2% per year according to Scenario 5 whereas
exchange rate should have had an appreciation rate of 8.3% each year as observed in Scenario 6.

Notice that dierent from Scenarios 3 and 4 the last two scenarios are not feasible in terms of policy. It is very
dicult to promote policies that yield a labor productivity growth of about 11.2% per year. This is also true and
more complicated in the case exchange rate. During the period of analysis we have seeing a huge appreciation of the
Brazilian real exchange rate. In this case, not only should the government had made real exchange rate devaluation
but with a magnitude of about 90 percentage points if we consider the nal value of 2011 against the 2003 value.
Certainly this policy would had perverse consequences in terms of all economy especially if the nominal exchange
rate was the variable of policy.

A huge reduction on import penetration would have demanded not feasible actions when we consider labor
productivity or exchange rate as exclusive variables of policy. There are other aspects that explain the invasion of
imports on Brazilian domestic market as we said before, foreign labor productivity and xed eects of sectors that
is not manageable in terms of policy. The average growth of foreign labor productivity was 3.3% per year between
2004-2011. For instance, whether instead the foreign labor productivity have had a growth of 0% per year, the
average level of Brazilian import penetration would have been almost 2 percentage points lower.

8 Conclusion

This paper evaluated the inuence of Brazilian labor productivity and exchange rate on the participation of imports
on the domestic consumption of manufacturing sectors measured by import penetration. We evidenced empirically
that the importance of labor productivity is superior to real exchange rate. Furthermore, as predicted by our
theoretical model, dierences of impacts may also be explained by the presence of foreign inputs in the Brazilian
manufacturing production. As long as the sector has a higher participation of imported input on the total of inputs
used in production lower is inuence of exchange rate on the import penetration is reduced.

The import penetration of the sectors of intermediate and capital goods is a special case given that the group
is inelastic to the real exchange rate. As we pointed out, these sectors has the largest participation of foreign input
in domestic production when compared to the sectors of consumption goods.

In light of our empirical ndings it is possible to conclude that economic policies based on real devaluation

inuence the level of import penetration in a moderate way when compared to a policy of increasing domestic
labor productivity. This conclusion challenges the view that the principal problem faced by Brazilian manufac-
turing industry was the appreciation of national currency (real) in relation to the others trade partner currencies.
Furthermore, our results also confront the policy prescription for solving this problem.

It is strictly recommended a discretionary policy of currency exchange rate devaluation until a optimum specic
value. However, there are some drawbacks regarding to this prescription.
It is commonly accept that making
a real devaluation by an discretionary increase of nominal exchange rate is not easier because of exchange rate
pass-through to nal prices. In other words, it is not easy make a real devaluation of a currency through nominal
devaluation.

Secondly, an extension of our results indicates that for such economic policy be eective it should focus specially
on sectors with low imported input ratio which is extremely dicult. Otherwise, whether that policy also impacts the
sectors associated to the group of intermediate and capital goods, the impact over import penetration is practically
zero and may only aect their input costs. As a results, the elevation of the cost of capital goods could cause a
decline in the level of investment on the economy.

Finally, not only are labor productivity and exchange rate responsible for the massive increase of import pene-
tration. Factors as trade partner productivity and other xed eect related to sectors are also import. In this sense,
some policy target could be not feasible as for example reaching again the average level of import penetration of
the period 1996-2003 as we demonstrated previously.
