Abstract

The aim of this paper is to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for a ﬁrst order stochastic reduction on the
risk of crimes for residents of a large and dense urban center. Inspired by Cameron and DeShazo (2013),
we develop a simple structural choice model that nests a process of contingent valuation (CV) among
lotteries and estimate it by both parametric maximum likelihood and geographically weighted regression
(GWR). Our empirical support is a unique and rich micro data set about victimizaton in Fortaleza, CE
(Brazil). For the global model (i.e., without spatial effects), we estimated an average WTP of R$ 23.35
per month/household, and an implicit value of a statistical robbery approximately equal to R$ 11,969 per
crime avoided. By means of geographically weighted regression (GWR), we ﬁnd that variables Sex, Age
and Education present a reasonable amount of spatial heterogeneity and, as expected, follow the very
inertial city’s socioeconomic spatial distribution proﬁle. We implement as well a protocol to calculate a
surface of WTP using Kriging techniques. Income, age, and crime spatial distributions have important
effects on the surface of WTP. Although peripheries present lower willingness to pay, as long as we
go inwards there is plenty of heterogeneity on its spatial distribution for risk reductions. Our results
supports a theory of crime with an active role for victim (costly) precautions.

Introduction

Contingent Valuation (CV) is a method that has been widely used in recent decades. Its foremost
objective is to infer, through public opinion’s surveys, the value of certain goods that are not readily
tradable on traditional markets, such as public goods and natural resources. This method consists
in constructing a hypothetical market for a certain good, as realistic and structured as possible, such
that, by performing a survey, researchers can extract the maximum willingness to pay of individuals
for that good1. Bowen (1943) and Ciriacy-Wantrup (1947) were the pioneers to propose the use
of public opinion’s surveys specially developed for the valuation of social goods or collective goods
(Carson and Hanemann 2005). These authors believed that voting would be the closest substitute
to consumer choice, so they considered that the public opinion’s surveys would be a valid instrument
for valuation of these goods (Hoyos and Mariel 2010, Carson and Hanemann 2005).

Although the main goal of contingent valuation method has been measuring the monetary value
of a certain good for a individual (Carson and Hanemann 2005), there is a much more powerful
insight on top of it: welfare analysis. According to Hoyos and Mariel (2010), through contingent
valuation surveys is possible to obtain directly a monetary measure (Hicksian) of welfare associated
with a discrete change in the provision of an environmental good, either by substitution of one good
for another or by the marginal substitution of diﬀerent attributes of an existing good.

To understand the measurement of this value for the agent, we following Whitehead and Blomquist
(2006) and Carson and Hanemann (2005). Deﬁne a utility function that, for simplicity, only depends
on a good x and contingent good q, given by u(x, q). Thus, assuming that the good q is desirable,
and that q0 is the state in which the consumer has not the good and q1 is the state that the consumer
has access to the good, the consumer will pay to consume the good if, and only if, the utility obtained
with the consumption of the good is greater than the utility obtained without the consumption of
good, i.e., u1(x, q1) > u0(x, q0).

So, the consumer will maximize his utility function u(x, q), subject to his budget constraint,
given by y = px + tq, where y is the consumer’s income, p is the price of good x and t is the
price of contingent good q, to deﬁne the optimal level of consumption of goods x and q. From this,
we ﬁnd the indirect utility function, denoted by v(p, q, y), whose usual properties with respect to
p and y are satisﬁed. On the other hand, solving the problem of minimizing costs, subject to the
constraint level of utility in state q0, generates a expenditure function given by e(p, q, u), see (Mas-
Colell, Whinston, and Green 1995). According to Carson and Hanemann (2005), the value for the
individual, in monetary terms, of increment in utility caused by the change of state from q0 to q1 can
be represented by two Hicksian measures: the compensatory variation and the equivalent variation.
As shown by (Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green 1995). Formally, those measures are solutions to the
following equations, respectively:

v1(p, q1, y − C) = v0(p, q0, y)

v1(p, q1, y) = v0(p, q0, y + E)

(1)

(2)

Based on these two concepts, one can deﬁne the willingness to pay in two diﬀerent ways:
i) as
the diﬀerence between expenditure functions in the situation without contingent good and with
contingent good, and, ii) as the monetary value that leaves the consumer indiﬀerent between the status
quo and the increase in the provision of contingent good. Following Carson and Hanemann (2005),
it is possible deﬁne the willingness to pay’s function as a function to initial value q0, the terminal
value, q1, and the values of p and y in which the changes in q occur. However, a common assumption

1There is the concept of minimum willingness to accept, where the individual reporting the minimum amount for
which he would be willing to accept to give up consuming a good that he would have been entitled. However we will
not cover this side.

for both C(q0, q1, p, y) or E(q0, q1, p, y) is the fact that what is measured is a discrete change between
two deterministic “states of nature” with degenerate distribution, i.e., from initial value q0 (status
quo) with P rob(q0) = 1 up to the terminal value, q1 with P rob(q1) = 1. The more general, and
interesting, case of measuring willingness to pay for changes between (non-degenerate) lotteries of
“states of nature” are still lacking a complete approach in the literature, although Cameron, DeShazo,
and Stiﬄer (2010) and Cameron and DeShazo (2013) are notably exceptions.

Although the scope of applicability of the method has grown considerably, many key areas tradi-
tionally approached by economists has not been thoroughly touched upon by contingent valuation. A
notable example is crime. Since problems of measurement, externalities, and diﬃculties in assessing
costs plague the area of crime and economics, it appears to us that such state of aﬀairs can not be
understood. In fact, very few papers so far has applied the contingent method internationally and,
at a national level, we are aware of only one.

Ludwig and Cook (2001) estimates the beneﬁts of reducing crime using this method. In their
paper, Ludwig and Cook (2001) focus on gun violence, in a national survey in U.S. Using a parametric
form, they found a value of US$ 24.5 billion as the worth for American society for a 30% reduction
in gun violence or US$1.2 million per injury avoided. Still in the U.S., Cohen, Rust, Steen, and Tidd
(2004) using a nationally representative sample of 1,300 U.S. residents, found that the representative
American household would be willingness to pay between US$ 100 and US$ 150 per year for programs
that reduced speciﬁc crimes by 10% in their communities. Cohen, Rust, Steen, and Tidd (2004)
analyzed ﬁve types of crimes: burglary, serious assault, armed robbery, rape or sexual assault and
murder.

In the U.K., Atkinson, Healey, and Mourato (2005) valuated the cost of three violente crimes:
common assault (no injury), other wounding (moderate injury) and serious wounding (serious injury).
Theirs data set contained 807 observations in Wales and England. In the interview, respondents were
told that the probability of being victim of the select crime, 4% for common assault and 1% for both
other wounding and serious wounding, then each respondent was asked to express his WTP to reduce
his chance of being victim of this oﬀense by 50% over the next 12 months. The estimated values
for WPT encountered by them was £ 105.63, £ 154.54 and £ 178.33 for common assault, other
wounding and serious wounding, respectively.

Finally, in Portugal, Soeiro and Teixeira (2010) studied the determinants of higher education
students’ willingness to pay for reducing the risk of being victim of violent crimes. They conducted
a online survey with students of university of Porto, which had 1122 respondents. By means of a
parametric approach, they modeled WTP as a function of demographic factors (age and gender),
family related factors (income, dimension, dependents), degree (undergraduate, master, PhD) and
ﬁeld of study (economics, arts, ...), crime related factors (crime victim, crime time, physical injuries,
psychological damages, fear of crime), averting behaviour (lock the door), payment vehicle and policy.
They found that variables such as age and family members had a negative impact in WTP whereas
variables such as gender, fear of crime lock door and payment vehicle had a positive impact on
willingness to pay.

In Brazil, Ara´ujo and Ramos (2009) used contingent valuation to estimate the loss of welfare
associated to insecurity, utilizing the willingness to pay as a proxy. The survey was conducted in
the city of Jo˜ao Pessoa and had 400 observations. Respondents were asked how much they would be
willing to pay by a bundle of public security services, that contain: ﬁxed police posts equipped with
adequate weaponry; vehicles equipped for better care and eﬀective police action; oﬃcers trained,
with greater integration with the community and greater agility (speed) in citizen service; day and
night patrols and conducting educational programs to prevent violence and crime. They found that
public security is a normal and common good as well as that the estimated cost of insecurity in
Jo˜ao Pessoa varies between R$ 6.524.727,01, considering the most conservative estimative, and R$
104.864.863,52 for the highest value.

Although Ludwig and Cook (2001), Cohen, Rust, Steen, and Tidd (2004), Atkinson, Healey,

3

and Mourato (2005), and Soeiro and Teixeira (2010) propose valuations between non-degenerate
lotteries, they stopped very far from building a econometric model that incorporates the basic tenets
of choice under risk. Given that state of aﬀairs (lack of a conceptual empirical strategy for CV
among “lotteries”, and, incipient literature on willingness to pay for crime reduction policies), our
main contributions are:
i) to build (and estimate) a econometric model capable of assessing the
willingness to pay for ﬁrst order stochastic reduction in the risk of robbery, ii) to incorporate, in a
sensible and manageable way, spatial eﬀects to realistically mimics interactions present in a large
and densely populated urban center in Brazil, and, iii) to apply our empirical strategy to real data,
more speciﬁcally, to Brazilian data.

We believe to have succeeded in a satisfactorily way. We make use of a unique geo-referenced
sample of 4,030 households from the city of Fortaleza, CE (Brazil), containing information on so-
cioeconomic background, experience, expectation of victimization, and willingness to pay to reduce
some type of crimes (see, Carvalho (2012)). For the global model (i.e., without spatial eﬀects), the
parameters for all independent variables, except Age, show positive sign. Older people tends to pay
less to reduce crime than young people do, men and more educated people tends to pay more risk
reductions. Finally, as to variables of perception and experience of victimization (variable Perception
patrol is measured in decreasing order), the lower the perception of patrolling the greater the will-
ingness to pay to reduce the number of robberies, and people who was Victim of robbery tends to pay
more to prevent such experience again. We estimated as well an average willingness to pay of R$
23.35 per month/household, a higher value of R$ 5.91 than the estimated value of non parametric
form. Also, we estimated the implicit value of a statistical robbery approximately equal to R$ 11,969
per crime avoided. Both values are quite reasonable. As a matter of fact, our proposed speciﬁcation
made possible to estimate implicitly the average cost of each robbery in the city of Fortaleza. This
amounts to approximately 4,15% of the income. Multiplying this value by average income we have
a value of R$ 61,38 per robbery.

The full spatial heterogeneity reveals with our “local model”. By means of a geographically
weighted regression (GWR) it is possible to allow for the estimation of local parameters rather than
global parameters (Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton 2003). Now, the ﬁrst diﬀerence is the
lack of a unique estimated parameter for each independent variable. Instead, for each independent
variable, we have a possible diﬀerent parameter for each sampled point. Overall, the estimated spatial
heterogeneity bring us both expected results as well as surprises. The estimative mapping for variables
Sex, Age and Education present a reasonable amount of spatial heterogeneity and, as expected, follow
the very inertial city’s socioeconomic spatial distribution proﬁle. Given the geographically weighted
regression, we implement a protocol to calculate a surface of willingness to pay. In order to do that
we apply Kriging techniques. The image that emerges from such empirical exercise is not diﬃculty
to rationalize: the income, age, and crime spatial distribution of Fortaleza has an important eﬀect
on the surface of willigness to pay. Although peripheries present lower willingness to pay, as long
as we go inwards there is plenty of heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of willingness to pay
for robbery reduction. It is worth noting that the highest willingness to pay are not necessarily the
richest one, corroborating a theory of crime that posits an active role for victim (costly) precautions.
Besides this introduction, we have more 5 Sections. Section (2) introduces the data set employed
in our estimatives. Section (3) develops a simple structural model of contingent choice between
lotteries of risks and frame the resulting equation as a fully parametric econometric model, although,
given the type of data collected we end up estimating it by fully maximum likelihood. In order to
introduce our spatial eﬀects, Section (4) deals with geographically weighted regression and how to
manage that in our context. We call such model the “Local” to contrast with the previous one that
neglect spatial eﬀects. All estimatives are performed on Section (5), as well as the due interpretations
from the estimation exercises. Finnaly, Section (6) elaborates more on results and proposes futures
improvements.

2 Data Set

Our data set comes from a survey conducted in 2012 where a total of 4,030 households were
sampled along 119 districts (bairros) of the city of Fortaleza (Brazil) during the months of October
2011 to January 2012, see, Carvalho (2012). Besides information about socioeconomic background,
experience and expectation of victimization, Carvalho (2012) induced respondents express their will-
ingness to pay to reduce some type of crimes. a key component from the data set collected is due to
the fact that household, work and school positions were georeferenced.

The section about contingent valuation prsents respondents with a ﬁctional scenario where there
was a program to ﬁght against criminality, more speciﬁcally the crime of robbery. The respondent was
informed that the program was successful and succeeded in reducing 50% the amount of robberies.
However, to maintain this program, it was necessary that the population fund it by means of ﬁctitious
future taxes. Then, respondents were asked if they were willing to pay a monthly fee to maintain
that crime prevention program, and if so, by how much he would be willing to pay monthly. The
exact introduction and question wording were:

• Introductory Remark: Now I would like to know how much you are willing to spend to reduce
certain crimes in your town. In each case, I will ask you to answer whether you would vote ‘’yes” or
‘’no” for a Bill that would require from you and from each household in your community a payment
to prevent certain crimes. Remember that the money you agree to spend to prevent crimes is the same
that you could use to buy food, clothes or other needs to you and to your family.

• Question: Q105 Now forget about this program that was able to reduce homicides and think about a
new one. Let’s suppose a new government program funded by the population of Fortaleza managed
to cut in half the occurrence of personal robbery in Fortaleza. Would you be willing to pay a monthly
amount to keep this program of crime prevention?

Table 1 deﬁnes the variables used in this paper. Initially, we show the socioeconomic proﬁle, the
perception of security and experience of victimization of research participants. From a total of 4,030
observations in the initial sample, 246 observations were removed due to lack of information about
participation in the program and due to the diﬃcult in georeferencing respondent’s address. Table
2 shows that 44,66% of the respondents were men and 55,34% were women. Overall age of the
respondents were 39,45 years old, with completed fundamental school level. About income, the
average income was R$ 1,488.70 per month, but about 50% of respondents earn R$ 817.50 or less2.
As to victimization and perception of security, 23,24% of the respondents was victim of robbery
in the last ﬁve years at least once. As to perception of security, on average, respondents considered
that the probability of being robbed in the next 12 months is about 49.2%, although the perception
patrols is often (mean 2.05).

Out of 3,784 respondents, 1,709 (45,16%) answered that they are willing to pay a monthly fee
to fund the program to combat robberies, while 2,076 (54,86%) answered they would not pay any
amount. Despite the number of people who are not willing to pay to keep the programs to combat
crime is fairly high, it is consistent with other studies about contingent valuation, for instances,
Atkinson, Healey, and Mourato (2005), which had 34,57%, and Ara´ujo and Ramos (2009), which
had a rate of 48.5 %, the last one for the city of Jo˜ao Pessoa (Brazil). This second group is deﬁned
in the contingent valuation area as protesters. These people refuse to pay for a good either because
they think they already pay many taxes or, in the case of public goods, because it is responsibility of
the government the provision of such goods, or simply because it is the duty of other groups pay for
the provision of good3. However, it is possible that someone report a true zero value for the reduce
of risk of being robbed or just can not aﬀord to pay such amount.

2The minimum wage in Brazil at the time of the survey was equal to R$ 545,00.
3We also consider the fact that individuals do not reporting his willingness to pay for fear that, once answered a

value, the research can be used to make them pay the reported amount.

Notwithstanding that, we will not enter in this debate4, and we simply characterize them as
protesters. The protesters’ group, 50.48% of them were men, with average age of 41.42 years old
and with completed fundamental school level. In this group, the average income was equal to R$
1,488.90, but 50% of them earned R$ 817.50 or less. Concerning the expectation of victimization and
perception of security, 22,74% of them suﬀered at least one robbery in the last ﬁve years and they
consider that the probability of being robbed in the next 12 month is about 48,47%, even though
that the perception patrol is often. In the CV’s literature, the standard procedure for dealing with
this group is to remove them from the sample and proceed to estimation the maximum willingness
to pay (Strazzera, Genius, Scarpa, and Hutchinson 2003). However, Strazzera, Genius, Scarpa, and
Hutchinson (2003) states that this procedure is valid only when both groups are similar, since if this
is not the case, selection bias will pop up.

We compared the empirical distributions for both protesters and those who are willing to pay5 a
positive amount of money and are quite similar. Thus, protesters and tthose who are willing to pay
are quite homogeneous, which indicates that the estimates of willingness to pay using only the second
group should not be aﬀected by selection bias (Strazzera, Genius, Scarpa, and Hutchinson 2003).
Thus, we remove the group of protesters from the sample in order to estimate the cost of robberies.

Table 4 shows the frequency distribution of willingness to pay. Of the total of 1,708 respondents
who answered that they would accept to pay some amount for maintaining the reduction of robberies
crimes, 70 did not know/ did not want to inform a value from those presented in the payment card.
Thus, remaining 1,638 observations. The columns Cumulative frequency and Survival probability in
table 4 indicate, respectively, the number of persons and the percentage of the sample that is willing
to pay at least the indicated value. Thus, it can be seen that 990 person, equivalent to 60.40%, are
willing to pay at least R$ 10 for the maintenance of combating robbery crimes program.

One can also notice that as the value of willingness to pay increases, fewer people will be willing to
pay this amount!

From this empirical distribution of willingness to pay, it was estimated, non parametrically, the
maximum willingness to pay6. We estimated the value of R$ 17.44 as the average monthly value or
R$ 173.28 per year, as the value that each household would be willing to contribute to reduce by 50%
the number of robberies in the city of Fortaleza. Thus, multiplying this value by the total amount
of household in Fortaleza, that according to de Geograﬁa e Estat´ıstica (2012) is 709,952 households,
we estimated the total value of willingness to pay in the amount of approximately R$ 123.02 million
per year. Finally, considering that the number of robberies in Fortaleza in 2011 was equal to 33.2407,

6We consider only who response that he would willing to pay more than R$ 1.00 and equal or less than R$ 100.00

per month

7Considering only robberies informed to the public security authorities. Source: SSPDC-CE

7

we have that the implicit value of a statistical robbery8 is equal to R$ 7,402.03, that is the cost to
society of a robbery. However, this non parametric estimation is not the ideal procedure to estimate
the maximum willingness to pay, once is expected that the individual characteristics inﬂuence the
amount that the individual is willing to pay. So, in the next section will be present a parametric
model to estimate the maximum willingness to pay for maintain the program for reduce robberies.

3 Econometric Model

Our objective is to build a contingent valuation model to assess the willingness to pay for a
ﬁrst-order stochastic improvement on the odds of being robbed in the city of Fortaleza, Brazil when
subjective expectations about the risk is available. Since our data sets come from the same urban
space, spatial eﬀects should also be considered. The random vector (R, M, X), where R ∈ {0, 1} is
a binary indicator if a shock did not occur or did occur, M ∈ R+ measures shock’s monetary cost
(tangible and intangible costs), X ∈ RK a vector of individual and/or state-speciﬁc characteristics.
θ ∈ {0, 1} is an indicator of status-quo situation or alternative status to be achieved with transfers.
We deﬁne four “objective” distribution functions. PR,M,X(r, m, x) ≡ P rob(R ≤ r, M ≤ x, X ≤ x),
the distribution function of (R, M, X). Accordingly, the conditional distributions PR,M|X(r, m|X =
x) ≡ P rob(M ≤ m, R = r|X = x), PM|R,X(m|R = r, X = x) ≡ P rob(M ≤ m|R = r, X = x),
and PR|X(r|X = x) ≡ P rob(R ≤ r|X = x) are deﬁned. Index individuals by i ∈ {1, 2,··· , n}. We
R,M|X(r, m|X = x),
deﬁne, as well, four “subjective” distribution functions, say, P i

With a slightly abuse of notation, our basic random set up is described by the following vector

For each θ ∈ {0, 1}, any individual i ∈ {1, 2,··· , n} is endowed with an indirect utility function
given by Vi,θ = V (yi, θ). Where yi is sure amount of money and θ ∈ {0, 1} is an indicator of status-quo
situation or alternative status to be achieved with transfers. Two quantities of interests are:

E (Vi,0) = V (yi − m, 0)P r0

M|R,X × P r0,i

E (Vi,1) = V (yi − si − m, 1)P r1

M|R,X × P r1,i

R|X + V (yi − si, 0)(1 − P r1,i

(4)

For pragmatic reasons, we assume that each individual is risk neutral and assume a linear functional
form for his/her indirect utility function.

8To obtain this value just divide R$ 123.02 million by 16,620, the last one being the number of robberies avoided

Hypothesis 4. The indirect utility function for each θ ∈ {0, 1}, any in-

dividual i ∈ {1, 2,··· , n} is parametrized as V ((cid:101)yi, θ) =
β(cid:101)yi + αθXi + i,θ.

We also assume that the distribution of shock’s size is independent from the occurrence of the shock,
say R, and observed heterogeneity, X. Also, for simplicity, the expected value of size of the shock
depends only linearly on individual income.

First note that the expression for the willingness to pay si depends on the diﬀerence on the expected
value of the shock between the status quo and the new situation, say,
m, as well
as it depends on observed and unobserved heterogeneity. In fact, as expected given a risk neutral
agent, the income does not have a bite. However, in the sequel, we show that the shock value is a
function of the cross-product of income and subjective probability of robbery, say, P r0,i

Before we proceed it is worth noting that models that incorporate willingness to pay for ﬁrst-order
stochastic dominance improvements on risks is a quite new endeavor. In fact, there are only two
papers we are aware of, say, Cameron, DeShazo, and Stiﬄer (2010) and Cameron and DeShazo (2013),
that build on this topic. Their approach are diﬀerent from ours, however. So, Cameron and Huppert
(1989) proposes that contingent valuation data sets obtained through payment cards’ method can
be analyzed parametrically by means of maximum likelihood models with data in intervals. They
suggest that when an agent chooses a value in payment card, say tui, the true value of the agent’s
willingness to pay is greater than or equal to this value, but less than the next card value, say tu+1i.
Therefore, the probability that the agent choose to pay the tui value is equal to the probability that
the true willingness to pay it is in the range deﬁned by tui and tu+1i.

Thus, it is possible rewrite 11 as:

P (tui) = P (tui ≤ s < tu+1i)

By equation 10, we have that s has mean µ and standard deviation σ. Then, deﬁne µ as:

P (tui) = P (log(tui) ≤ log(si) < log(tu+1i))

This two measures provide what we call a global value for WTP. However, we expect that spatial
heterogeneity has an important role in the relation between the choice of how much the agent
wants to pay and his characteristics. This means that values of γ can be diﬀerent, which would
make individual WTP values diﬀer all over the city. A plausible explanation for this would be that
individuals through diﬀerent neighborhoods meet diﬀerent levels of criminality, whether observed or
not by police authority10, which would lead their willingness to pay to be diﬀerent. Thus, in order to
handle this issue of spatial heterogeneity we use geographically weighted regression technique (GWR)
to estimate a local WTP in such a way that will be possible identify in which regions the WTP will
assume higher values. Next section, presents the GWR model.

4 A “Local” Econometric Model

According to Almeida (2012), analyzing only the average or global response of a phenomenon
may not be useful or convenient, since socioeconomic phenomena are not likely to be constants
through regions. Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton (2003) refer to this situation as spatial non-
stationarity and claim that any relationship that is non-stationary over space is not well represented
by a global statistic and, indeed, this global value may be very misleading locally.

Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton (2003) aﬃrm that there are several reasons to expect
that a relationship vary over space. Among possible explanations we can cite sample variations, mis-
speciﬁcation and, most important, there might be some relationships that are intrinsically diﬀerent
across space. In the last case, it is suggested that there are spatial variations in peoples’ attitudes
or preferences or there are diﬀerent administrative, political or other contextual issues that produce
diﬀerent responses to the same stimuli over space.

In the case of the object of study of this article, it is a stylized fact that crime distribution is
heterogenous across space. In big cities, like Fortaleza (the ﬁfth largest city in Brazil with an area of
313 square kilometers, boasting one of the highest demographic densities in the country, say, 8,001
per km2), occurrences robbery are concentrated on richer areas of the city, leading to formation
of clusters of criminality in these areas. Due to this heterogeneous distribution, we expected that
individuals’ reactions to crime be also heterogeneous. So, we expect that an individual who lives in a
region with high rates of criminality to have a diﬀerent behavior than an individual who lives in low
crime prone regions. Thus, unlike classical models of spatial dependence, here we not expect that
individuals can inﬂuence each other willingness to pay, but we expected that diﬀerent individuals
have diﬀerent factors that inﬂuence his willingness to pay. So, a variable that can inﬂuence the
willingness to pay for individual i maybe have no inﬂuence on individual j, or have more or less
inﬂuence. In this way, a local model is necessary to estimate this relationship.

The geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a method that extend the traditional re-
gression framework by allowing the estimation of local parameters rather than global parameters
(Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton 2003). This method generates a sequences of regressions

of a crime, which does not always happen.

estimated for each region, using subsamples of the data, weighted by distance (Almeida 2012). Sub-
samples are created from the regression or calibration point, that is the reference point for the
parameters estimation for the region i. From this point, each observation belonging to the sample is
weighted according to its distance to the calibration point. Close observation have a higher weight,
while more distant observations have a lower weight (Almeida 2012).

The weights used for the creation of these subsamples is taken by the spatial kernel function.
According Almeida (2012), the kernel function is a real, continuous and symmetric function, which
integral sums one, like a probability density function. This function uses the distance (dij) between
two points and a parameter of bandwidth (b) to determine a weight between these two regions, which
is inversely related to geographic distance (wij) (Almeida 2012).

Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton (2003) classiﬁes the spatial kernel functions in two groups:
the ﬁxed kernels and the adaptive kernels. In the ﬁxed kernels, the bandwidth (b) is ﬁxed, which
may lead to problems of bias and eﬃciency. With a ﬁxed bandwidth, the number of observations in
each subsample may vary substantially. In regions where data are dense, the kernels are larger than
they need be and hence using information in excess, turn estimates biased. On the other hand, in
regions where data are scarce, the kernels are smaller than they need be to estimate the parameters
reliably (Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton 2003). The adaptive kernels reduce both problems
by making the bandwidth (b) greater or smaller depending on data density in the area. We use the
ﬁxed11 gaussian12 kernel, deﬁned by equation 19:

(19)

(21)

Due to the aforementioned problems the choice of the bandwidth (b) must be made so that try to
solve the trade-oﬀ between bias and eﬃciency. To this end, to avoid arbitrary choices, the bandwidth
is estimated using the data (Almeida 2012). There are several techniques13 used to determine the
optimal value of the bandwidth. In this paper, we use the cross-validation technique. It consists in
minimizing the following function, represented by equation 20:

CV =

(yi − ˆy(cid:54)=i(b))2

(20)

i=1

where yi is the dependent variable , n is the number of observations, b is the bandwidth and ˆy(cid:54)=i(b)
is the ﬁtted value of yi using a bandwidth of b with the observations for point i omitted from the
calibration process (Almeida 2012). Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton (2003) aﬃrm that this
approach has the desirable property of countering the wrap-around eﬀect, since when b becomes very
small, the model is calibrated only on samples near to i and not at i itself.

After obtaining these weights generated by the kernel function, it is possible to get the local

5.1 Results from the Global Model

Table 5 shows the results of the estimation of the global model represented by Equation 16. All
parameters are statistically signiﬁcant. The sign of estimates indicate the eﬀect on willingness to
pay. All variables, except Age, show positive sign. The negative sign of variable Age indicate that
older people tends to pay less to reduce crime than young people, indicating that older people have a
greater feeling of security than young people. As to variables Sex,Education the positive sign indicate
that men and more educated people tends to pay more for reduce the risk of being robbed. Finally,
as to variables of perception and experience of victimization (variable Perception patrol is measured in
decreasing order), the lower the perception of patrolling the greater the willingness to pay to reduce
the number of robberies, and people who was Victim of robbery tends to pay more to prevent such
experience again.

Variable I(Subject Prob. * Income) deserve a special attention. The positive sign of this variable shows
that the higher is the income and the subjective probability of being robbed the higher will be the
willingness to pay for reduce the risk of being robbed. On the other hand, when this variable is
multiplied by θ we have the fraction, in average, of the income robbed in each robbery. This value
is equal approximately to 0.0415. So, in each robbery, approximately 4,15% of the income is robbed.
Multiplying this value by average income we have a value of R$ 61,38 per robbery.

In next table 6, the values of estimated WTP, as deﬁned by equation 17, are presented.

The average WTP estimated from global model is equal to R$ 23.35 per month/household, a higher
value of R$ 5.91 than the estimated value of non parametric form, which was only R$ 17.44. Thus,
if the government decided to implement a monthly tax in this value, would be possible to raise, per

year, R$ 280.20 per household, which would generate an average tax revenue of about R$ 198.92
million per year, equivalent to approximately 20.63% of the amount spent on public security in the
state of Cear´a in 201114. Assuming a worst case scenario, using as a benchmark the median value of
WTP of R$ 16.21 per month/household, we have a value of R$ 194.52 per year/household. In this
case, the annual tax revenue in Fortaleza would be approximately R$ 138.09 million, equivalent to
14.32% of spending on public security in 2011.

Now, considering the damage of robberies to society, in ﬁrst scenario, where the WTP was
estimated in R$ 23.35, it is estimated the implicit value of a statistical robbery approximately equal
to R$ 11,969 per robbery avoided. Considering the second scenario, where was utilized the value
of median WTP equal to R$ 16.21, the value of a statistical robbery was estimated approximately
equal to R$ 8,310 per crime avoided. Next section presents results from the local model.

5.2 Results from the Local Model

As discussed early, considering only the average or global response of a phenomenon may not
be useful or convenient, see (Almeida 2012). In this way, we estimated15 a local model speciﬁed by
Equation 22. First, we present the estimated model with a ﬁxed bandwidth. The cross-validation
technique16 pointed us a bandwidth (b) of 3,5399 km with a CV score of 578.2882. Table 7 shows
the estimates17 under this value of b.

Now, in contrast with global model, we have a parameter distribution for each variable. In this type

14According to the de Seguran¸ca P´ublica (2012), the amount spent on public security in the state of Cear´a in the

year 2011 was R$ 964,095,556.61.

15To estimate this model, we use the R statistical software (R Core Team (2014)), more speciﬁcally packages

“maxLik” (Henningsen and Toomet (2011)) and “spgwr” (Bivand and Yu (2013)).

16This computation lasted approximately 1 day, in a Intel Core i5-2400 CPU 3.1 GHz 4,00 GB RAM.
17This computation requires approximately 3 hours, requiring much less time than the choice of bandwidth.

of model, the tabular representation is not a good deal. Although we should show 8 ﬁgures (one
for each of the 8 variable appearing in Table 7), for pragmatic reasons we present four, say, Subject
Prob. * Income, Sex, Age, and Education. So we present this result in Figures (2), (3), (4), and (5).
For example, in west region of the city of Fortaleza, the impact of variable Subject Prob. * Income is
greater than in east regions. The same pattern occurs for variables Sex and education.

For variable Age, the impact is grater is east regions. Note that with this parameter distribution, it
is possible to create a willingness to pay’s distribution. In order to do that we plug in the parameter
vector into each individual’s vector of observations and calculate the expected willingness to pay
and sort them into six classes. Figure 6 show us the spatial distribution of willingness to pay. In
this ﬁgure, we see that the highest values of estimated willingness to pay is concentrated in central
region of the city, in the prime area. This area is populated by rich people and is the area where is
concentrated the greatest amount of robberies in the city, which can explain this concentration of

Before we compare this values with those from the global model, we will construct a interpolated
surface to predict the willingness to pay for entire city of Fortaleza. To do that, we will use the
Ordinary Kriging technique18. In this map (see, Figure 7), we can see that the border of the city

Although in this area the crime rate
is extremely high, the types of crimes which occurs are crimes against life, while robberies are less
common. Furthermore this area is populated by low income people, which have little to be stolen.
On the other hand, in dark areas, we have a high willingness to pay. In this area, the reverse pattern
occurs. There are a high level of crimes of robberies and a low level of crimes against life. Moreover,
in this the population is composed by high income people, that have more to be stolen. Thus,
this heterogeneity in spatial distribution of crime and income may be a explanation to the spatial
heterogeneity in willingness to pay distribution.

Comparing the values in local model with those from the global model, we can see that in almost
whole city the willingness to pay is lower then the average global willingness to pay. Therefore, in
case of implementing a tax, if the value set is equal to R$ 23.35, many people looses welfare, once
the value that they will pay is higher than that they want to. On the other hand, there are many
people that want to pay more than they will pay, so the government will loss funds of this group.
So, a ﬂat tax to ﬁnance crime reductions is not eﬃcient. A ﬁrst degree price discrimination (see,
(Varian 2006)), where each unit of a goods must be sold to an individual at his/her reservation price
or his/her maximum willingness to pay, might be a better solution, although politically diﬃcult.
Therefore an eﬃcient and ideal way might be to determine the tax value by areas, setting it to the
estimated maximum willingness to pay in that area.

6 Final Considerations

This paper sought to apply a new methodological approach to estimate willingness to pay in a
large urban center in Brazil that includes spatial eﬀects in the analysis. We constructed a theoretical
model that explains the determinants of willingness to pay from the random utility model for a
ﬁrst-order stochastic improvement on the odds of being robbed in the city of Fortaleza, Brazil when
subjective expectations about the risk is available. We showed that the determinant factors explaining
willingness to pay in the city of Fortaleza are Subject Prob*Income, Sex, Age, Education, Perception
patrol and Victim of robbery.

From global model, we estimated mean willingness to pay equal to R$ 23.35 per month/household
as the value that representative citizen of Fortaleza would be willing to pay for reduce in 50% the
amount of robberies in the city. From this value, we calculated in approximately R$ 198.92 million
the total cost to society, equal to 20.63% of the total amount spent on public security in the state of
Cear´a in 2011. We also estimated the WTP per robbery avoided equal to R$ 11,969.

In our greatest contribution, the local model, utilizing a ﬁxed gaussian kernel function with a
ﬁxed bandwidth approximately equal to 3.5 km, we estimated a geographically weighted regression
with interval regression that, to the best of our knowledge, is the ﬁrst study to do so. In local model,
we showed that in almost whole city, the willingness to pay estimated in local model is lower than
one estimated in global model and that there is island where this value is greater. So, in case of
implementation of a tax, the most eﬃcient procedure is discriminate the tax according to the area.
As suggestions for future studies, we believe that the estimation utilizing a adaptive bandwidth
are worth pursuing. Also, the construction of a new model relaxing the hypothesis of risk neutrally is
a ﬁne way to go. Finally, replicating our empirical exercise on diﬀerent data sets coming from diﬀerent
institutional backgrounds might be something worth pursuing in order to validate our approach.
