Abstract

The Eﬃcient Market Hypothesis is one of the most popular subjects in the empirical ﬁnance liter-
ature. Previous studies in the stock markets, which are mostly based on ﬁxed time price variations, do
not provide conclusive ﬁndings, in which evidence of short-term predictability varies according to dif-
ferent samples and methodologies. In this work, we propose a novel approach and use drawdowns and
drawups as triggers in order to investigate the existence of short-term abnormal returns in the stock mar-
kets. As these measures are not computed within a ﬁxed time horizon, they are ﬂexible enough to capture
time-dependent subordinated processes that could be driving market under or overreaction. According
to our results the Eﬃcient Market Hypothesis is supported by the majority of estimates. Results also
provide stronger support for underreation hypothesis than overreaction, with the highest prevalence of
return continuations than reversals. Evidence for UIH is present in some markets, mainly after events of
lower magnitude.

Introduction

In 2008, when Queen Elizabeth II asked a group of professors at the London School of Economics why
had nobody noticed the ﬁnancial crisis coming2, your highness was probably not aware she was addressing
one of the most important and controversial topics in Finance: the predictability of the ﬁnancial markets.
The origin of this debate dates back at least to Bachelier (1900), which developed the mathematics of the
Brownian motion as a model for stock prices’ variations and concluded that they followed a random walk,
in which expected speculators’ proﬁts should be zero. Since then, the randomness of the ﬁnancial markets
became a subject of great interest and scrutiny among academics and market participants.

Almost half a century ago, Prof. Eugene F. Fama published his ﬁrst broad review of the theoretical and
empirical literature on this subject3 and, at that time, he already recognized the area was “so bountiful” that
he apologized for any missing references. His paper consolidated and popularized the concept of eﬃcient
market as one “in which prices allways fully reﬂect available information” and deﬁned the classic taxonomy
that distinguishes the three diﬀerent forms of market eﬃciency: weak (past return), the semi-strong (public
information) and the strong (public and private information), according to the type of information used to
predict future prices.

After that, the academic debate has been driven around what is now well known as the “Eﬃcient Market
Hypotheis” (EMH), which evolved from the random walk theory of asset prices4. As Ball (2009) have ex-
plained, the idea behind the Hypothesis merges the insight that competition among rational agents reduces
trading margins close to zero with another one stating that asset prices ﬂuctuations are driven solely by the
arrival of new and relevant information. Rational expectation plays a central role explaining how transaction
prices remain as best estimates for market equilibrium. When all investors are rational, no one would be
willing to enter into a mispriced transaction. Even with the presence of some irrational agents, the com-
petition among rational arbitrageurs would avoid prices to move away from market equilibrium (Friedman,
1953).

As emphasized later by Fama (1991) in his second literature review on the issue, this hypothesis cannot
be tested empirically without a complementary assumption about an equilibrium model that would properly
reﬂect all available information into the process of price discovery. The joint-hypothesis problem, as he
calls it, does not make empirical research uninteresting at all. Despite not being able to test market eﬃciency
alone, he argues that the ﬁeld has developed as one of the most successful in empirical economics improving
our understanding on the behavior of securities returns.

With the development of the ﬁeld of cognitive and social psychology5, economists were provided with a
better understanding of how biases on judgments and beliefs can aﬀect the individual decision-making pro-
cess as well as the market behavior as a whole. The emergence of “Behavioral Economics”, though, added
many insights to the market eﬃciency debate by incorporating new evidence on human behavior departures
from rationality hypothesis. Inspired by the evidence on Kahneman and Tversky (1979) that individuals
tend to underweight base rate (prior) data and overweight recent information, DeBondt and Thaler (1985)
presented their widely known early research ﬁnding empirical evidence of long-term overreaction in the US
stock market.

The ﬁrst studies on short-term overreaction, however, showed quite controversial results. While Arbel
and Jaggi (1982) and Atkins and Dyl (1990) found no evidence on the violation of the EMH, Bremer and
Sweeney (1991) found that large negative daily returns are followed, on average, by signiﬁcant abnormal
positive returns. Overall, the literature presents diﬀerent theories to explain price behavior following large
price variation events and there seems to be no consensus on which of them prevails. Besides overreaction,
another behavioral explanation, known as the underreaction hypothesis6, assumes that new information is
not immediately incorporated into market prices causing near term future returns to follow the direction of
preceding large price changes.

It is also possible that abnormal returns may be explained by no anomaly at all, based on conventional
rational expectations’ framework. Under the Uncertain Information Hypothesis (UIH)7, the systematic risk
of stocks tend to increase at the same time of large price variations, which leads to a demand for higher
expected returns from risk-averse rational investors. As a result, this hypothesis predicts return continuation
after large price rises and reversals after large drops.
In addition, there are also explanations related to
market microstructure, in which spurious serial correlation may be caused by unsynchronized trading or
bid-ask bounce eﬀects8.

Amini et al. (2013) oﬀer a broad and detailed review on the short-term predictability of stock markets
after the observation of large price variations, comparing diﬀerent markets, time periods and methodologies
used in the empirical research. In their conclusions, they suggest that the literature could beneﬁt from future
research using diﬀerent ways to deﬁne large returns, such as looking at those conditional on other factors.

In this work, we try to follow that idea and propose to use drawdowns and drawups as triggers in order to
investigate the existence of short-term abnormal returns in the stock markets, using 10 diﬀerent stock price
indexes from developed and emerging markets. Drawdowns and drawups are deﬁned as the cumulative price
variation on a sequence of negative or positive returns, respectively. Diﬀerent from ﬁxed time measures as
daily, weekly or monthly returns, the duration of drawdowns and drawups varies randomly according to
investors’ behavior. As these measures are not computed within a ﬁxed time horizon, they are ﬂexible to
capture time-dependent subordinated processes (local dependence) that could be driving investors’ under
or overreaction 9. Therefore, the use of drawdowns and drawups may provide additional understanding of
market behavior compared to ﬁxed time statistics, specially those related to the occurrence of large returns10.
We estimate the abnormal returns following the dummy variable approach similar to Karaﬁath (1988)
and Mazouz et al. (2009) for time periods from 1 to 21 business days after the event ending dates. Residual
variance is assumed to follow the GJR-GARCH model proposed by Glosten et al. (1993), which captures
both GARCH structure and the asymmetries in the data and, therefore circumvents some restrictive assump-
tions on standard OLS estimation. As pointed out by Mazouz et al. (2009), GARCH methods lead to higher
estimation eﬃciency, avoiding invalid inferences due to failures in capturing market uncertainty variations
close to event periods.

Our results show a great variety of estimates across the diﬀerent stock market indexes in the sample,
providing evidence that price behavior after large drawdowns and drawups varies according to country spe-
ciﬁc market features. Similarly to previous empirical literature, we do not provide conclusive evidence on
short-term predictability of stock market returns following large price variations. The Eﬃcient Market Hy-
pothesis is supported by the majority of estimates. Results also providence stronger support for underreation
hypothesis than overreaction, with the highest prevalence of return continuations than reversals. Evidence
for UIH is present is some markets, mainly after events of lower magnitude.

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section presents the data and Section 3
discusses the methodology. Section 4 describes the empirical results, while the conclusion is presented in
the last section.

2 Data Sample

Data used in this research is composed by daily close prices of 10 stock price indexes within 8 diﬀerent
countries:
the Dow Jones Industrial Average - DJIA (US); the S&P500 (US); the Nasdaq Composite -
NASDAQ (US); The Euro Stoxx 50 Index - SX5E (European Union); the London stock exchange - FTSE
100 (UK); the Hong Kong stock exchange, Hang Seng - HSI (Hong Kong); the Brazilian stock exchange
index - IBOVESPA (Brazil); Mexican stock exchange - MEXBOL (Mexico); Indonesian stock exchange -
JCI (Indonesia); and the Korean stock exchange - KOSPI 200. We intentionally selected data from developed
and emerging economies to compare their results and to try to provide anecdotal evidence on eventual
diﬀerences between these 2 groups.

Daily returns are obtained by the natural logarithm of the ratio between the close price of each business
day and the close price of the previous business day (and they are multiplied by 100 to express percentage
returns). Observation periods are diﬀerent among indexes but all series ends at December 31, 2015. The

9As emphasized by Mandelbrot (1963), for price returns distributions with inﬁnite second moment, the total price variation
is usually concentrated in a few trading days. According to Clark. (1973), these turbulent cascades could be explained by some
time dependent subordinated process, that could be related to market microstructure variables, such as trading volume or number
of trades, which are ultimately related to investors’ behavior. Dacorogna et al. (1996), Levitt (1998), Weron and Weron (2000)
and Gerhard and Hautsch (2002) are examples of alternative ways to capture the dynamics of the ﬁnancial time series using the
concept of elastic time.

DJIA is longest series in the sample, with 28,885 daily returns (around 116 years) and the IBOVESPA is
the shortest, with 5,309 daily returns (around 22 years). Table 1 presents basic statistics of the daily returns
of all indexes. Most of the results are consistent with previously documented stylized facts of stock market
returns, such as negative skewness and excess kurtosis11. Diﬀerences in the number of drawdowns and
drawups are explained by our strict deﬁnition, in which consecutive days with same price causes the ending
of such events.

2.1 The Anatomy of Drawdowns and Drawups in the Stock Markets
Drawdowns and drawups are deﬁned as the total percentage price variation observed in a period of con-
secutive negative or positive returns, respectively. Formally, assume Pt as the asset price (index value) at
day t and rt = (Pt/Pt−1 − 1) as the daily return at this same date. Pt is said to be a local maximum when
prices in the previous and following day are lower, Pt−1 < Pt > Pt+1. Local minimum, reversely, are deﬁned
when Pt−1 > Pt < Pt+1. A drawdown with duration equal to d days is deﬁned as a sequence of price drops
Pt > Pt+1 > ... > Pt+d, where Pt is a local maximum and Pt+d is the following local minimum. Accordingly,
drawdowns’ severities may be computed in both of the following ways12:

− 1 =

Pt+d
Pt

(1 + rt+i) − 1

Table 2 summarizes simple statistics of drawdowns and drawups of all indexes. In general, average
returns of drawups are slightly higher than average returns of drawdowns. On average, drawdowns and
drawups are hogher for emerging markets, what is consistent with the higher risk premia and volatilities
observed in these higher risk environment.

For developed markets, drawdowns distributions seems to present a longer tail that drawups distributions,
as we can see the three largest drawdowns showing more severity that the three largest drawups. In the case
of emerging markets, it is quite the opposite, where largest drawups are observed with higher magnitudes
than largest drawdowns.

2.1.1 The First Dimension - Magnitude

Drawdowns and drawups are featured by two dimensions: magnitude and duration. Tables 3 and 4 show
drawdowns and drawups’ frequencies according to diﬀerent severities’ ranges, based on multiples of the

11Rydberg (2000).
12Drawups are deﬁned analogously, considering positive returns.

sample standard deviation of daily returns of each index. In general, the stock market indexes present similar
distributions, where most of drawdowns and drawups’ severities are concentrated in the 0-1σ range with
relative frequencies from 55% to 60%, showing a lower number of observations for higher severity ranges.
Drawups seem to be concentrated in higher severities ranges than drawdowns, as we can observe frequencies
in the ﬁrst range categories around 50%. The JCI Index seems to be an outlier in this dimension, showing
more frequency than the other indexes in the lowest severity range both for drawdowns and drawups.

In this work, as we are concerned with the information embedded in market events with large magni-
tudes, we will focus in drawdowns and drawups of magnitude higher than 2 daily returns’ standard devia-
tions, which represent around 20% of drawdowns and drawups in each index sample.

2.1.2 The Second Dimension - Duration

Tables 5 and 6 present the observed frequencies os drawdowns and drawups’ durations, described in busi-
ness days. The longest duration of negative consecutive returns correspond to NASDAQ’s 16 business days,
for the developed economies, and 19 business days of JCI, for the emerging markets. On the gains side,
NASDAQ presented the longest drawup duration equivalent to 19 business days. For all indexes, the dis-
tributions of drawdowns’ durations seem to be more concentrated in the shortest duration, 1 business day,
as the observed frequecies of drawups present higher values for longer durations than drawdowns ones. As
we can see further we will provide additional analysis focusing on drawdowns and drawups with duration
greater than 2 business days, trying to catch information provided by events with persistence through longer
time periods. We did not ﬁnd any speciﬁc pattern comparing ﬁgures from developed and emerging markets.

2.1.3 Relationship Between Two Dimensions

It is reasonable to assume that longer drawdowns and drawups will provide returns of higher magnitudes.
Among the stock market indexes in our sample, correlations between drawdowns’ durations and severities
lies around -0.5 to -0.7, while drawups’ correlations are calculated around 0.5 to 0.7. Table 7 presents the
distribution of drawdowns and drawups durations for samples with magnitudes higher than multiples of the
DJIA daily returns’ standard deviation. For samples with higher severities, the duration mode increases to

6

3 or 4 days, showing that higher severity events are associated with longer duration processes. Also, draw-
downs and drawups lasting one day tend to be less frequent as magnitude rises whereas longer durations’
frequencies tend to be more prevalent. This same pattern is observed for the other indexes of our dataset.

The average daily returns of drawdowns and drawups for diﬀerent durations are illustrated in Figure1.
Overall, we can observe that not only drawdows’ magnitudes tend to grow with duration, but also daily
average severity of drawdowns increase with duration. Regarding drawups, we observe the opposite, in
which daily average returns of drawups decreases with the duration. Comparing the two groups of countries,
we can observe higher disparity between emerging markets and bigger variation of daily average returns for
diﬀerent durations. This seems to be a normal feature due to the higher volatility and fatter tails observed in
emerging stock markets.

3 Methodology

Large returns are deﬁned based on whether the magnitude of drawdowns or drawups is located in diﬀerent
variation ranges computed for each index separately, according to the standard deviation of its sample daily
returns (σ), as shown in Table 1. For drawdowns, the ranges are deﬁned as −3σ ≤ DDtd < −2σ and
DDtd < −3σ. Drawdups ranges are deﬁned similarly, as follows: 2σ < DUtu ≤ 3σ and 3σ < DUtu. The
threshold of 2σ was deﬁned to limit our analysis to large price variations and is consistent with previous
studies related to stock market indexes13.

As these measures are computed during diﬀerent time spams, the event ending date is taken as the day of
the last negative return on a drawdown (or the local minimum day) or the last positive return on a drawup (or
the last local maximum day). To assess whether post-event returns can be considered abnormal, we follow
the dummy variable approach in line with Karaﬁath (1988) and Mazouz et al. (2009). For each day t in the
sample of daily returns, Dt,2 is the dummy variable that equals 1 if t is the second business date after the event
ending date and 0 otherwise. Dummy variables for windows greater that 2 business days will be equal to 1
whenever any speciﬁc date belongs to a time window that ranges from the second business day immediately
after the event and the speciﬁed maximum number of business days in each window. Formally, as deﬁned in

13See Lasfer et al. (2003) and Nam et al. (2006) for examples.

Figure 1: Average daily returns of drawdowns and drawups by diﬀerent durations. Developed markets on
the left and emerging markets on the right

Mazouz et al. (2009), Dt,2, Dt,3, ..., Dt,N will take value equal to 1 if t ∈ [+2, +2], [+2, +3], ..., [+2, +N] and 0
otherwise, where [+2, +N] is the period span comprised by the second and the N-iest business day after the
event ending date.

The presence of abnormal returns is investigated through the estimation of the following regression for

each stock market index daily log return rt:

logrt = α + φnDt,n + t

(2)

, where α is the constant, φn are the coeﬃcients of the dummy variables Dt,n and t ∼ N(0, h2

t ). To account
for well documented pattern on the volatility of stock index returns14 and to avoid estimation ineﬃciencies
due to constant volatility assumption, the variance on eq.(2) is assumed to be conditional and to follow a
GJR-GARCH model:

t = ω + (δ + ν1t−1)2
h2
t−1

+ βh2
t−1

+ γnDt,n

(3)

, where ω is a constant, δ and β are the conventional GARCH coeﬃcients (Bollerslev (1986)), γ is the
assymetry coeﬃcient proposed by Glosten et al. (1993) and 1t−1 is the indicator variable, which is equivalent
to 1 when t−1 < 0 and 0 otherwise. Cumulative abnormal returns associated with windows ending at the
n-iest business day after events end dates are estimated as CARn = φn × (n-1). We have excluded the ﬁrst
business day after events’ ending dates from previous dummies’ windows because, by deﬁnition, they will

Also, as drawdowns and drawups are deﬁned in a sequence of cumulative negative or positive returns,
respectively, In the next section, we provide additional analysis to test for abnormal returns in at drawdowns’
and drawups’ ending dates.

4 Empirical Analysis
4.1 Preliminary Investigation on Returns After Drawdowns and Drawups
Figure 2 presents cumulative daily returns of the 63 consecutive business days after drawdowns with abso-
lute severity equal to or higher than 3 standard deviations of sample daily returns os each stock market index.
The graphs show every and average cumulative return following the second business day after drawdowns
ending dates and the average ﬁgures. On the right column, we show the graphs with the average cumulative
daily returns (gray line) and the cumulative daily returns of the 21 consecutive business days after draw-
downs ending dates (black line). Under the EMH, we would expect no abnormal returns after these events,
where daily returns should behave accordingly to the sample average returns (straight lines on graphs).
Figure 3 presents the same information for drawups. As the ﬁnancial time series often show ARCH (autore-
gressive conditional heteroscedasticity) structures, we can observe periods where high severity drawdowns
and drawups tend to cluster together.

Figure 2: Cumulative returns after drawdowns

only for periods after a drawdown greater or equal than 3σ of daily returns os each stock market index is observed

4.2 Estimation Results
Table 8 presents the regression estimates of abnormal daily returns following large drawdowns. The columns
represent diﬀerent time spans, from 2 to 21 business days, and the 2 blocks of estimates assume diﬀerent
deﬁnitions for large returns, relative to the standard deviation of the daily log returns series (σ). Table
9 presents the same estimates for abnormal daily returns following large drawups. Augmented Dickey-
Fueller test cannot reject the hypothesis that indexes daily return series are stationary. The time horizons
in our sample are long enough to capture diﬀerent states of the market, including widely documented crisis
periods. In general, we observe a greater occurrence of large drawups than large drawdowns.

4.2.1 Abnormal Returns Following Drawdowns

Overall, the majority of indexes presented signiﬁcant cumulative abnormal returns for at least one time
window following an event of large drawdown. FTSE is the only index that showed no evidence of abnormal
returns in response to drawdowns of magnitude between 2σ and 3σ, whereas SX5E, FTSE, MEXBOL and
KOSPI showed no evidence of abnormal returns following drawdowns of magnitude higher or equal that
3σ, providing evidence supporting market eﬃciency hypothesis.

The DJIA is the index with largest number of signiﬁcant estimates, related to the period of 3, 4, 5, 10 and
21 business days after the business day following drawdowns’ ending dates. The second day after drawdons’
ending dates show signiﬁcant abnormal returns only in the case of drawdowns with severity higher than 3σ
of daily returns. S&P500 and NASDAQ, the other two US stock market indexes, also presented signiﬁcant
estimates for a lower number of periods after drawdowns. When considering drawdowns of lower magnitude
(2 to 3 σ), the three US indexes (DJIA, S&P500 and NASDAQ) present results similar to previous empirical
studies reporting subsequent reversals15, providing additional support for the overreaction hypothesis. We
ﬁnd evidence of reversals also for IBOVESPA and MEXBOL. SX5E, HSI, JCI and KOSPI, at the contrary,
provide evidence of return continuation after drawdowns of this magnitude.

15Amini et al. (2013)

10

Considering larger drawdowns with severity equal to or higher than 3σ, nevertheless, it is interesting to
observe that all US indexes show evidence of return continuation behaviour, which are consistent with the
underreaction hypothesis. HSI and IBOVESPA also showed a return continuation pattern where JCI is the
only index showing return reversals after these largest drawdowns.

In summary, the evidence regarding return behavior following large drawdowns is mixed, providing
support for diﬀerent hypothesis. Eﬃcient market and overreaction hypotheses seems to be more prevalent
for large drawdowns of lower magnitude and both the eﬃcient market and the underreaction hypotheses for
large drawdowns of highest magnitudes.

4.2.2 Abnormal Returns Following Drawups

On the side of large positive cumulative returns, the SX5E is the only index that showed no evidence of
abnormal returns following drawups of magnitude between 2σ and 3σ. DJIA is also the index with the most
signiﬁcant estimates in the case of abnormal returns in response to large drawups, followed by the other
US market indexes. SX5E, FTSE, HSI and IBOVESPA are the indexes showing no evidence of signiﬁcant
short-term abnormal returns for drawups with larger magnitude.

Except for one estimate of the S&P500 index, the US indexes results provide evidence for return con-
tinuation following drawups considering the two diﬀerent groups of severities. Regarding the other stock
markets, HSI, IBOVESPA, MEXBOL show evidence of return continuation, while FTSE shows a reversal
pattern. JCI and KOSPI presented mixed results depending on the severity of drawups and the time window.
For drawups of lower magnitude, for example, KOSPI index showed return continuation in the second busi-
ness day following the event ending date and reversal in until the tenth business day after drawups ending
date.

4.2.3 Combined Evidence on Drawdowns and Drawups

Therefere, for the US market, there seem to be a supporting evidence for UIH only for drawdowns and
drawups of magnitude between 2σ and 3σ. Tail events seem to support the underreaction hypothesis which
predicts return continuation after large price variation events, in which the information embedded in large
consecutive price variations is not immediately incorporated into prices or may be positively correlated with
following new information.

In the case of the US indexes, our results are in line with the ﬁndings from Nam et al. (2006) and Bali
et al. (2008), that documented an asymmetry in the eﬀects following negative and positive large returns.
Both studies found that negative returns tend to revert more quickly than positive ones. However, contrarily
to Bali et al. (2008), as abnormal returns after drawdowns of magnitude equal to or higher than 3σ are
supportive of the underreaction hypothesis, our ﬁndings suggest that short term reversals tend to occur
mostly after lower magnitude drawdowns.

Table 10 summarizes the results for each stock market index. EMH is supported by no signiﬁcant
estimates. Overreaction is supported by estimates showing reversal patterns and underreaction hypothesis,
at the contrary, by estimates providing evidence of return continuation. The UIH is supported by evidence
of signiﬁcant subsequent positive return after large drawdowns and drawups.

Atasanova and Hudson (2008), Hudson et al. (2001) and Mazouz et al. (2009) have also documented
asymmetries related to the size of large price changes used as triggers to observe following returns.
In
this work, as stated before, this asymmetries are observed only in the case of drawdowns in the US stock
market indexes, supporting the overreaction hypothesis for events of magnitude between 2σ and 3σ and the
underreaction hypothesis for larger magnitude events.

NDD represents the number of drawdowns in the sample. DDN shows estimates in the period span com-
prised by the second and the N-iest business day after drawdons’ ending dates. Large drawdowns repre-
sented by magnitudes between 2 and 3 standard deviations of the daily series returns (top) and magnitudes
higher or equal than 3 standard deviations of the daily series returns (bottom). For each index, numbers
in the top line are the abnormal return estimates and numbers in the bottom line are the robust p-values
computed based on White (1982).

(cid:63) represents supporting evidence in regression estimates for at least one time horizon following drawdowns or drawups used
in our study. Eﬃcient Market Hypothesis means no abnormal results. Overreaction means return reversals and underreaction
hypothesis means return continuation after large drawdowns or drawups. The Uncertain Information Hypothesis (UIH) is
supported by the evidence when positive abnormal returns are observed both after large drawdowns and drawups.

4.2.4 Larger Duration Eﬀects

We also estimate abnormal results following large drawdowns and drawups with durations equal or greater
than 3 business days. In this case, we want to verify whether this time dependent behavior of consecutive
negative or positive returns for periods with larger durations may inﬂuence the pattern of abnormal returns
observed after these events. Tables 12 and 13 in the Appendix show GJR-GARCH estimates for abnormal
returns following large drawdons and drawups, respectively. As a whole, we could not ﬁnd any diﬀerence
from patterns observed in the biggest sample, with drawdowns and drawups of all durations. US indexes tend
to provide evidence supporting the same hypothesis as the evidence above mentioned. HSI and IBOVESPA,
for instance, also show signiﬁcant negative estimates for the ten business days following the second business
day after drawdowns’ ending dates in both samples with all durations and durations higher than 2 business
days, for events with magnitude equal or higher than 3σ of daily series returns. We also did not observe
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in drawups’ estimates.

4.2.5 Testing for Abnormal Returns at Ending Dates

We also use the same dummy approach to test whether positive and negative returns in the business days
after drawdowns’ and drawups’ ending dates present a signiﬁcant higher magnitude than average positive
and negative returns. For each day t in the sample of daily returns, Dt,neg is the dummy variable that equals
1 if t presents a negative return and 0 otherwise. Dt,1 is the dummy variable that equals 1 if t is the ﬁrst
business day after the event end date and 0 otherwise. Abnormal returns for the ﬁrst business day after
the events is then tested with the estimation of the following regression for each index daily log return rt,
assuming GJR-GARCH innovations as in eq.(3):

logrt = α + φnegDt,neg + φ1Dt,1 + t

(4)

14

The majority of indexes present abnormal returns at the business day immediately after the ending dates
of drawdowns and drawups, showing that daily positive and negative returns after both events, respectively,
present magnitudes statistically higher than average daily positive and negative returns. All estimates are
positive, showing that ending dates positive returns after drawdowns are higher than average positive returns
and also that ending dates negative returns after drawups are lower in severity than higher than average
negative returns.

For events of larger severity (equal or greater than 3σ), ending dates of drawdowns present statistically
signiﬁcant abnormal returns for every index in the sample, whereas only S&P500, NASDAQ, HSI and
KOSPI presented signiﬁcant results for drawups’ ending dates’ returns. For those 4 indexes, nevertheless,
we observe that S&P500, HSI and KOSPI show negative estimates, showing diﬀerences in ... according to
the severity of drawups.

5 Conclusion

In this study, we have investigated short-term abnormal returns in 10 stock market indexes following large
price variations. We propose a novel approach and use drawdowns and drawups as event triggers. As
these measures are not computed within a ﬁxed time horizon, they are ﬂexible to capture time-dependent
subordinated processes (local dependence) that could be driving a market under or overreaction. We use
the dummy variable approach similar to Karaﬁath (1988) and Mazouz et al. (2009) for time periods from
1 to 21 business days after the event ending dates. To circumvent restrictive assumptions on standard OLS
estimation, we assume residual variance in the regressions to follow the GJR-GARCH model proposed

15

by Glosten et al. (1993), which leads to higher estimation eﬃciency and avoids invalid inferences due to
volatility clustering close to events dates.

The results show a great variety of estimates across the diﬀerent stock market indexes in the sample,
providing evidence that price behavior after large drawdowns and drawups varies according to country
speciﬁc market features. This interpretation is also supported by the very similar results presented by the
three US indexes used in this work. Similarly to previous empirical literature, we do not provide conclusive
evidence on short-term predictability of stock market returns following large price variations. The Eﬃcient
Market Hypothesis is supported by the majority of estimates. Results also providence stronger support for
underreation hypothesis than overreaction, with the highest prevalence of return continuations than reversals.
Evidence for UIH is present is some markets, mainly after events of lower magnitude. As the UIH is an
explanation based on market rationality, it seems natural that results provide evidence for behavioral biases
explanations considering drawdowns and drawups for greater magnitude.

*, ** and *** denotes statistical signiﬁcance at the 10.0%, 5.0% and 1.0% signiﬁcance level, respectively.
NDD represents the number of drawdowns in the sample. DDN shows estimates in the period span com-
prised by the second and the N-iest business day after drawdons’ ending dates. Large drawdowns repre-
sented by magnitudes between 2 and 3 standard deviations of the daily series returns (top) and magnitudes
higher or equal than 3 standard deviations of the daily series returns (bottom). For each index, numbers
in the top line are the abnormal return estimated and numbers in the bottom line are the robust p-values
computed based on White (1982).
