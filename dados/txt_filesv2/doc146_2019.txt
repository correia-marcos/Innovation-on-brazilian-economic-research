Abstract

This paper empirically evaluates the eﬀects of BNDES Profarma on Brazil-
ian pharmaceutical ﬁrms, estimating the quantitative eﬀect on its main ob-
jective, the expansion of innovative eﬀorts. More speciﬁcally, it is of special
interest to verify whether supported companies invested more in internal
R&D than comparable non-supported ones. The present study combines
ﬁrm-level data from the Brazilian Innovation Survey with BNDES Profarma
loans information for the 2004-2014 period. Using Fixed Eﬀects regression,
we found Profarma’s supported ﬁrms increased internal R&D expenditures
by up to 76% and total innovation expenditures by up to 59%.

Introduction

The objective of this article is to empirically evaluate the eﬀect of BNDES Pro-
farma on the Brazilian pharmaceutical industry, highlighting the quantitative ef-
fect on its main objective, the expansion of ﬁrms’ innovative eﬀorts. More speciﬁ-
cally, it estimates whether companies supported by the program invested more in
internal R&D activities than non-supported ones.

The pharmaceutical industry has in its technological innovation its main factor
of competitiveness (Malerba & Orsenigo, 2015). High investment in R&D activ-
ities, coupled with strong interaction with local science and technology systems,
mean that industry is usually classiﬁed as high technology (OECD, 2017) and
science-based (Pavitt, 1984). Moreover, as their products directly inﬂuence hu-
man health, and consequently, labor productivity, it is possible to aﬃrm that their
innovative activities exert positive externalities on other sectors of the economy
(Pimentel et al. , 2012).

From the structural point of view, at the global level, the pharmaceutical in-
dustry is characterized as an oligopoly, in which the leading companies operate in
a broad (global) market, dedicating themselves to product diﬀerentiation through
high investments in R&D. The other actors seek niche markets as in therapeu-
tic classes, technological routes or speciﬁc geographic spaces (Hasenclever et al. ,
2010).

However, in developing countries, such as Brazil, local pharmaceutical ﬁrms
face entry barriers to compete with ﬁrms in the global market, and may therefore
not be able to accumulate skills for innovation. Therefore, if industrial policy is to
promote the competitiveness of this industry, it should support within-company
R&D activities with adequate instruments for this purpose.

In Brazil, before the 2000s, pharmaceutical industry’s market share used to be
concentrated by multinational companies, which focused on marketing rather than
on R&D activities. National ﬁrms were dedicated to speciﬁc niches, mainly low-
cost, low-technology drugs. However, the last two decades have been marked by
signiﬁcant changes in the institutional environment: trade opening of the sector,
adherence to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPS) and New Patent Law (1996), Generic Law (1999), creation of An-
visa (1999) and prioritization of the sector in explicit industrial policies from 2004
on (Gomes et al. , 2014). In this context, BNDES created a speciﬁc program for the
industry, BNDES Profarma, whose aim was to promote sector’s competitiveness.
The present study combines ﬁrm-level data from the IBGE Innovation Survey
with BNDES contracting information by the Profarma program, in a panel from
2004 to 2014. Using a regression based on ﬁxed eﬀects, it was veriﬁed that the
BNDES Profarma was able to increase the expenditures in internal R&D activities
by up to 76.3% and by up to 58.8% the expenditures in all innovative activities

by the beneﬁciary companies.

This article is divided into eight sections, including the Introduction. The
second section presents the stylized facts about the pharmaceutical industry as an
economic sector and about the evolution of the Brazilian pharmaceutical industry.
In the third section, we present the logic of Profarma’s intervention, its main
objectives, which guided the construction of the research questions. Next, we
discuss the empirical literature on policies to support innovation and the available
evidence of such policy’s impact in Brazil. Then, the following sections presents
the description of the data used, the models and the results obtained. The last
section discusses policy implications and presents future research agenda.

2 The Pharmaceutical Industry

Pharmaceutical industry is the economic sector that researches, develops and man-
ufactures medicines and vaccines, being part of the Health System value chain
(Gadelha, 2003). From a microeconomic perspective, the market is characterized
by a wide set of market failures. On the demand side, medicines are considered cre-
dential goods and there is asymmetric information and principal-agent problems in
the relationship among manufacturers, institutional payers, doctors and patients.
In the supply side, there are barriers of entry, such as patent protection and high
regulatory requirements in industrialized economies (Fiuza & Lisboa, 2003). Phar-
maceutical industry is usually cited as the main sector in which patents are eﬀective
means to knowledge appropriation (Levin, 1987).

Competition is based on R&D investments, which classiﬁes the industry as
science based (Pavitt, 1984) and of high technological intensity (OECD, 2017).
Also imitation strategies are based on R&D, such as “mee too” drugs, incremental
innovation and generic drug development (Malerba & Orsenigo, 2015). Major
pharmaceutical clusters are found in industrialized countries in connection with
extensive pools of knowledge and competences in the ﬁeld. Thus, companies and
countries who seek to join the pharmaceutical competitive landscape must ﬁnd
ways to build this kind of knowledge and competences, increasing local R&D
investments (Lindman et al. , 2008).

Back in the 1990s, the Brazilian pharmaceutical industry activities were mostly
commercial. Global multinationals dominated the local market though imports,
acting as traders, disconnected from their more innovative global activities. Local
pharmaceutical companies were inexpressive, based on a restricted portfolio of low
cost “me-too” drugs, that have not encouraged a greater innovation eﬀort. The
R&D intensity was below 0.5% until 2003, ﬁrst data available, same level of the
overall Brazilian manufacturing industry, a poor result for a high tech industry
(Bastos, 2005)

2

In 1999, a new institutional framework was built for the sector, with the ap-
proval of the generic drug law the creation of a new regulatory agency, Anvisa,
inspired in highly regulated markets agencies such as the North-American Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In
early the 2000s, increasing ﬁrms R&D investments was at the center of the new
industrial policy debate, known as PITCE.1

The 2000s and ﬁrst half of the 2010s may be considered the golden age of the
Brazilian pharmaceutical industry. Led by generic drugs and income redistribution
policies, the drug market grew yearly at a two digits real rates. Also, national
companies achieved nearly two thirds of market share by 2014, when they had less
than a third in the beginning of 2000s. Also, pharmaceutical ﬁrm R&D intensity
grew to 2.2% in 2014, while general manufacturing rate grew only to 0.7% (Reis
et al. , 2017). Thus, while unintended, the generic drug regulation had an impact
on the market structure, favoring domestic companies both in terms of market
share (large increase) and in R&D and innovation investments (small increase)
(Caliari & Ruiz, 2014).

3 BNDES Profarma

In 2004, BNDES created a low-interest targeted loan program speciﬁc for the phar-
maceutical industry, known as BNDES Profarma2. As other BNDES credit lines,
it was open to any pharmaceutical company that would invest in Brazil, not being
restricted to national ﬁrms. Also, it’s a targeted loan program because it ﬁnanced
speciﬁc use items, focused mostly in capital and innovation investments, such as
construction, machinery modernization, ﬁrm R&D team salary and research goods
and services. Besides, BNDES team monitors the destination of the resources all
over the contract. Finally, the low interest rates were common at BNDES at that
time, because the Brazilian Government set the BNDES interest rates lower than
the average risk free treasury bill to foster investments.3

The program has three major phases: the ﬁrst (2004-2008), second4 (2009-2013)
and third (2013-2016).
In the ﬁrst two phases, it’s stated key objectives were:
(i) foster the compliance of the local manufacturing to new Anvisa regulations;

1For more details on the Industrial, Technological and Foreign Trade Policy, see Mazzucato

& Penna (2015) and Capanema & Palmeira Filho (2004).

2This section is based on literature review on the program, published in BNDES journals and

in interview with the program manager

3For example, in 2007, the Brazilian Government set the Long Term Interest Rates was 6.25%
p.y and the average Brazilian treasury interest rate that year varied within 11% p.y. and 13%p.y.
4The second phase expanded the targeted ﬁrms, including the Medical Devices sector, intro-
ducing the concept of Health Industry Complex. For the sake of the paper, we focused only in
the pharmaceutical industry.

(ii) increase medicines local production; (iii) increase local R&D activities; (iv)
strengthen local ﬁrms economic and technological competences and; (v) mitigate
the pharmaceutical value chain trade deﬁcit (Capanema et al. , 2008). Latter, in
its third version, the program reduced its intended scope, focusing on innovation
and productivity. It also included a biotechnology catch-up objective, which will
not be discussed in the present paper.

Following its key objectives, the program had two main subprograms5, called
“innovation” and “production”. This distinction was associated to diﬀerent use
items and ﬁnancial conditions. Lower interest rates and longer maturities were as-
sociated with “innovation” subprogram, which supported use items like ﬁrm R&D
team salary and research goods and services. On the other hand, “Production”
subprogram was associated to machinery modernization and new facilities con-
struction. This subprogram had not as good ﬁnancial conditions as “innovation”
subprogram, although still considered low interest rates. This meant that the pro-
gram focused on proper internal R&D investments, but also considered broader in-
novation investments, such as ﬁrm modernization and productivity. Nevertheless,
following the innovation international consensus, the “production” subprogram
may be considered innovation, since machinery modernization and new to the ﬁrm
manufacturing facilities are considered in the Oslo Manual (OECD & Eurostat,
2018).

Another key operational issue relates to the nature of the ﬁnancing supported
by the innovation subprogram. Since innovation involves high uncertainty and
often projects fail and are discontinued, BNDES developed an ”innovation plan”
support approach. This means that the contract does not state speciﬁc drugs or
projects to be ﬁnanced. The company would present its innovation strategy and
a forecast of projects to be ﬁnanced, but those could be changed. BNDES mon-
itors the use items (R&D team, innovation inputs etc), not speciﬁc development
projects.

4 Literature Review

Public support to ﬁrms’ R&D investment is among the oldest innovation policies,
linked to the linear model of innovation of early 1950s. Its rationale is based on a
diagnosis of ﬁrm R&D under-investment that results of low ﬁrm R&D investments
appropriation and desirable spillover eﬀects of business R&D. Thus, it’s compatible
with a broad range of economic traditions, ranging from neoclassical market failure
to innovation systemic failures approaches (Cunningham et al. , 2016).

5Other subprograms, such as exports, restructuring, and support to state-owned labs had

very low number of contracts, as we will show in latter within this article

4

Additionally, there’s also market failure in the ﬁnancial market to innovative
projects due to information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers, who’d
have more information about the associated risk then lenders (Hall & Lerner,
2010). This is especially relevant in developing countries such as Brazil, where
capital markets are less developed. For example, Ambrozio et al.
(2017) found
evidence that Brazilian ﬁrms face ﬁnancial constrains for investments in general.
Public support for innovation may be described as indirect, such as tax incen-
tives, or direct, such in the form of grants and targeted loans. The expected chain
of events may be described as following: public support to ﬁrm’s R&D will increase
overall R&D invested by that ﬁrm; thus, that ﬁrm would develop new products
and create more innovation related jobs; the increased ﬁrm’s innovation eﬀorts
would in most cases increase new product revenues, leading to the growth of that
ﬁrm. At the macroeconomic perspective, higher overall R&D investments may be
related to higher probability of economic gains, such as higher labour productivity,
exports and knowledge intensive jobs (Cunningham et al. , 2016). Those expected
eﬀects may be grouped in two categories: those that are readily measurable, such
as ﬁrms total R&D expenditure, ﬁrm growth, proﬁtability and R&D employment;
and intangible outcomes, such as skills, innovation capabilities and spillover eﬀects
(Cunningham et al. , 2016).

In a wide scope systematic review of impact and eﬀectiveness of government
support for R&D and innovation, covering pappers between 2003 and 2017 on Eu-
ropean Union, OECD Countries, China and Taiwan, Petrin (2018) found that the
evidence is slightly positive for public support to ﬁrms R&D expenditure (input ad-
ditionality). However, it’s inconclusive whether public support crowds out private
investment. In pre-2000 studies, the evidence seems not to reject the crowding-out
eﬀects, while post-2000 results are more in favour of crowding-in hypothesis. This
divide seems to be grounded on methodological diﬀerences between the two sets of
research, since most of pre-2000 empirical works did not use techniques to control
for endogeneity, selection bias and unobservable heterogeneity. Thus, the state
of the art of the evidence rejects the crowding-out eﬀect, suggesting that public
support to R&D has actually crowding-in private R&D investments at the ﬁrm
level.

The evidence also suggests that policy design inﬂuences its results. For exam-
ple, ﬁrm size is an important issue: policies that target SMEs usually has positive
results. When the policy includes larger ﬁrms, the results usually become incon-
clusive or even negative. Other important issue of policy design is the intervention
used: generally speaking, grants, subsidies and loans performs better than tax
incentives (Petrin, 2018).

Regarding sectoral diﬀerences, Lee (2011) found that public support tends to
have positive eﬀects on private R&D for ﬁrms in industries with high technological

5

opportunities and high market competition. On the other hand, while controlling
for sectoral diﬀerences, the author did not found diﬀerential eﬀects for ﬁrm size
and age (Lee, 2011)

There is a growing empirical literature on the impact of Brazilian innovation
policy. Regarding studies on ﬁrms’ R&D intensity, De Negri et al. (2006) rejected
crowding out hypothesis for Brazilian Innovation Agency (FINEP) loans, using a
data between 1996 and 2003 and a Propensity Score Matching approach. This
result was latter reinforced by Avellar (2009) using the same approach and data
until 2005.

Araujo et al (2012) measured the impact of grants on R&D employment, show-
ing that R&D employment of the treated group grew at a higher rate than those
of the control group. Also, using ﬁrm-level data on innovation activities of BN-
DES supported ﬁrms for all sector and a ﬁxed eﬀect approach (FE), Machado
et al. (2017) rejected the crowding-out eﬀects, ﬁnding an increase in ﬁrms’ R&D
expenditures varying between 30% and 40% in diﬀerent speciﬁcations. On the
other side, Rocha (2015) found that ﬁrms that received any kind of government
support did not increase their R&D eﬀorts. The available evidence suggests then
that diﬀerent government policies have diﬀerent results on the same output.

Focusing on the Brazilian pharmaceutical industry, CGEE (2017) built a qual-
itative innovation competences model and applied it to a sample of national phar-
maceutical companies. They found that the surveyed Brazilian companies had
well-established internal manufacturing, generic drug development and incremen-
tal innovation capabilities. For radical drug innovation, they found a few initia-
tives, but usually outsourced.

Speciﬁcally on BNDES Profarma, Pieroni et al.

(2011) used survey and de-
scriptive statistics to discuss the program’s contribution to innovation eﬀorts. They
found that ﬁrms supported by BNDES Profarma had high levels of manufacturing
compliance and grew their own R&D and innovation investments, compared to
overall sector, although they didn’t implemented methods to isolate the eﬀects.

In synthesis, the international empirical literature on public support to innova-
tion suggests that it has has positive eﬀects in increasing private R&D investments
at ﬁrm level. The evidence on Brazilian speciﬁc programs also ﬁnds similar eﬀects.
For the pharmaceutical industry, the studies reviewed identiﬁed a positive scenario
of growing R&D competences and investments. Nevertheless, the available evi-
dence for this economic sector does not isolate the eﬀect of BNDES Profarma on
local R&D investments, which is the purpose of the present paper.

5 Data

5.1 Database

We used ﬁrm-level data to carry out our empirical strategy based on two sources:
the Brazilian Innovation Survey (Pintec) from IBGE (Brazilian Geographic and
Statistics Institute) and a database of BNDES Profarma loans. Pintec-IBGE is a
ﬁrm-level data that aims to explore and measure the innovative activities devel-
oped by Industrial and selected Services sectoral companies, as well as to monitor
their evolution over time. Pintec follows conceptual and methodological guide-
lines of Oslo Manual of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD, 1997), which makes Pintec data comparable to other international inno-
vation surveys.

Pintec is published by IBGE on a triennial basis and, by now, there are six
available editions of Pintec: 2000, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014. For each
version of the survey, its questionnaire refers to a period of three years for the
qualitative variables: the survey year and previous two. While, for the quantitative
variables, like R&D Expenditures, Pintec’s reference year is precisely the year of
the survey.

Pintec surveys only Brazilian formal companies with 10 or more employees.
Survey sample design is restricted to manufacturing, extractive, electricity and
gas, music editing and recording, data processing and internet hosting, telecommu-
nications, information technology, architecture, engineering, testing and technical
analysis and R&D services sectors. For companies with 500 or more employees (for
manufacturing) and 100 or more employees for services, Pintec is a census survey
and for companies below those threshold, it is a sample survey. Pintec’s sample
design is deﬁned to represent the target population of Brazilian ﬁrms under those
selection criteria. 6

The logical structure of the questionnaire of Pintec follows a division by blocks
of questions, according to the topics of interest of the research. The ﬁrst block
refers to the general characteristics of the company, such as number of employees,
payroll, costs and revenues. The second block is aimed at the ﬁrm’s innovative
proﬁle. Here is a sample split. For ﬁrms that claim to have made product and / or
project innovation or have incomplete or abandoned innovation projects, the re-
search explores the company’s innovative activities. For those who did not innovate

6Pintec sample design explore information available from other Brazilian sources in the Na-
tional System of Innovation in its attempt to represent adequately the innovation phenomenon
at a more aggregate level. Examples of those sources of information are: companies that have
received any governmental support for innovative eﬀorts, and companies that have declared
to carry out formal R&D eﬀorts and that have applied for patents. For more details, see
http://www.pintec.ibge.gov.br

7

and do not have innovative projects, which correspond to about half of the ﬁrms
surveyed annually, the questionnaire goes directly to the last block of questions
related to problems and obstacles to innovation. For innovative ﬁrms, the follow-
ing research blocks involve the description of innovative activities, their ﬁnancing,
the purchase of external R&D activities, the realization of internal R&D activi-
ties, the impact of innovative activities in the company, sources of information,
interinstitutional cooperation, government support and the non-formal protection
methods available.7

For its turn, BNDES data is a ﬁnancing-level data comprising information
about ﬁrms’ Profarma loans contracted over the period 2004-2014. It is important
to note that BNDES Profarma credit program is included as a whole in BNDES’
statistics for innovation loans. Thus, we considered both its innovation and ﬁxed
capital lines, because we consider the pharmaceutical sector as being a very rel-
evant R&D intensive sector and then would like to analyze the innovation eﬀort
behaviour of the whole supported companies. We found that BNDES Profarma
had 119 ﬁnancing-level operations with 47 companies in this whole period. 38%
of these companies took innovation loans, and 23% took credit for both the inno-
vation lines and the ﬁxed capital lines. It is important to note that the database
mainly covers the ﬁrst two phases of Profarma, since the third and last phase
started only in 2013.

Table 1 shows some descriptives of BNDES data on ﬁrms supported by BNDES
Profarma credit lines over the three-year periods deﬁned by the Pintec structure.
We note that the number of loans increased from 14 in the period 2004-2005 to 30
in the period 2012-2014. The total amount contracted, in turn, increased from BR$
117 million to BR$ 1.3 billion in the same period. Speciﬁc operations to support
innovative activities comprised 29% of the operations and 45% of the total value
contracted in that period, with a growing trend. This table also presents loan value
distribution statistics for ﬁrms during the 2004-2014 period. The mean value of
the distribution of loans for ﬁrms increased over the period, going from BR$ 8.4
million to BR$ 43,4 at the interval end.

However, given the loans value distribution is right-skewed, we observe the
median is far below the mean for each year from 2004-2005. For instance, the
loans median were BR$ 4,8 millions in 2006-2008, while the mean were BR$ 18,8
millions. The median loan for supporting ﬁrms’ innovation varied between BR$
2 million (in 2004-2005) and BR$ 20,5 million (in 2012-2014). There is a steep
growth in the last quartile of loan distribution from 2011.

7Information on continuous variables of innovation eﬀort and results was discarded for ﬁrms
that declared to be non-innovative and / or lacking or incomplete innovation projects. Such a
procedure was necessary since this information would be counter-intuitive in view of Pintec’s
own logical structure.

5.2 Data Preparation

In this paper, we used Pintec’s survey years of 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014 to build
a ﬁrm-level panel data for the period 2005-2014. To condition on ﬁrms’ eligibility
to the program, the sample of Pintec data was restricted to pharmaceutical ﬁrms.
More speciﬁcally, the sample was restricted to ﬁrms classiﬁed in Division 21 of
the National Classiﬁcation of Economic Activities (CNAE)8, which refers to the
manufacture of pharmaceuticals within the manufacturing industry. According to
the IBGE, this division comprises the manufacture of pharmaceutical products,
the manufacture of medicines and other products, such as bandages and antiseptic
preparations.

Another restriction made in the present study occurred in the innovation eﬀort
variables. As the work has the objective of verifying the eﬀects of crowding in
and crowding out of the intervention in the companies, it was decided to restrict
these variables to their positive values. In the same way, it is emphasized that
the greatest interest of the evaluation is on the level of investment in R&D of the
ﬁrms, and not on the decision to invest or not.9

We aggregated BNDES ﬁnancing-level data by company and year of the loan,
so we built a ﬁrm-level BNDES Profarma data for the 2004-2014 to be merged with
Pintec’s panel. In order to maximize the number of BNDES Profarma’s supported
ﬁrms found in each year of Pintec, we matched the year information of BNDES
data to match with the closest superior Pintec’s year. For instance, we matched
2012, 2013 and 2014 BNDES’ ﬁrm-level data years to 2014 Pintec’s year. We then
merged both ﬁrm-level panels to obtain the ﬁnal dataset for the 2003-2014 period,

8CNAE is the classiﬁcation oﬃcially adopted in Brazil in the production of statistics by type
of economic activity. It is used by the Public Administration for the identiﬁcation of economic
activity in registrations and registrations of legal entity. By providing a standardized basis
for collecting, analyzing and disseminating statistics on economic activity, the CNAE enables
the comparability between economic statistics from diﬀerent national sources and the country’s
statistics at the international level to be broadened (IBGE, 2007).

9This approach tends to be conservative in terms of the potential size of the eﬀects, as it does

not include potential eﬀects on the extensive margin.

9

where we estimated the models presented in the last section.

After that, we built our treatment variable, called BNDES. The variable is a
dummy that assumes 1 if a ﬁrm had access to BNDES Profarma innovation credit
in the current Pintec’s year and keeps assuming 1 in subsequent years of the data,
being 0 otherwise. This choice was based on two considerations: ﬁrst, Profarma
ﬁnances innovation plans of companies, rather than speciﬁc innovation projects,
which requires several years until completion. Second, it is possible that Profarma
have long term eﬀects on innovation investment outcomes based, for example, on
the view of ﬁrms’ process of accumulating internal capabilities and knowledge for
innovation.

Five indicators of input additionality were drawn up. First, Total Innovation
Expenditures (TIE), deﬁned as the sum of all expenditures of the ﬁrm. Second,
Total R&D Expenditures (RDE), both internal and external to the ﬁrm. Third,
Internal R&D Expenditures of the ﬁrm (IRDE). Fourth, Equipment Expendi-
tures (EE), that is, the sum of expenditures on the acquisition of machinery and
equipment. Fifth, ﬁrm’s Other Expenditures (OE), deﬁned as total expenditures
less R&D and capital goods expenditures. This category includes expenses with
acquisition of software, acquisition of external knowledge, training of labor and
introduction of technological innovations in the market.

Our control variables includes ﬁrm size indicators such as Employment and
Labor Productivity (calculated as the ratio of gross production value to ﬁrms’
employment). Finally, the ﬁrm’s Financing Obstacles situation was controlled,
identiﬁed by companies with an interest in innovation that reported ﬁnancial dif-
ﬁculties as obstacles to innovation.10

5.3 Data Description

Table 2 shows descriptive statistics at the ﬁrm-level for some of the variables of
Pintec. The ﬁnal dataset comprises 739 observations of ﬁrms, with a mean of 185
per year. The ﬁrms supported by BNDES Profarma account for 73 observations
of ﬁrms over the whole period. Table 2 also compares the means and standard
deviations of some innovation indicators and control variables used in the models
by treatment status. We see there are large diﬀerences between ﬁrms supported
by BNDES and the non-supported ones. In general, treated companies tend to
invest more in R&D activities and are larger than the others in terms of sales and
employment. Finally, supported ﬁrms are more likely to receive other forms of
public support and to engage in innovative activities.

Those substantial diﬀerences stems from the pattern of selection to access BN-

continuous variables used in the regressions.

DES Profarma. As investment in innovation activities is very risky, larger com-
panies tend to be more willing to carry out such activities. Also, despite several
special ﬁnancial conditions for BNDES innovation lines, like reduced threshold for
applying for direct support and lower interest rates, BNDES credit risk policy still
tends to favor the selection of larger companies to reduce potential losses.

Table 2 additionally reports that the share of average R&D expenditures in
total innovation expenditures between supported companies is around 70%, while
the share of internal R&D in total R&D is almost 80%. That reveals the relevance
of internal R&D for the treated companies.

6 Empirical Strategy

This section describes the empirical approach adopted to estimate Profarma ef-
fects on selected innovation investment outcomes of treated companies. We are
interested in modelling the eﬀects of Profarma low-interest loans on the level of
innovation investment of the pharmaceutical companies ﬁnanced by the program.
The decision about the innovation investment level of ﬁrms in this industry de-
pends on a set of explanatory variables at the ﬁrm level, such as the expected return
of the innovation plan, the ability of the entrepreneur (both unobserved) and on
observed covariates like company size, labor productivity and market power.

Furthermore, there is evidence of greater severity of ﬁnancing constraints for

11

innovation investment in the context of less developed capital markets, like the
Brazilian one ((Hall, 2002); (Czarnitzki, 2006)).
If this is the case, innovation
investment will also depend on the availability of external funding to the company.
Consequently, in the absence of external funding or depending on the its costs,
ﬁrms’ innovation investment level might be restricted to the availability of ﬁrms’
internal funding, causing ﬁrms to underinvest. In this context, the availability of
public ﬁnance, like BNDES’ one, might help to alleviate ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial constraints
for innovation investment, thus raising its level.

Hence, we condition our model of ﬁrms’ innovation investment level on access
to Profarma loans as our measure of interest of ﬁrms’ access to external ﬁnancing.
In a causal context, if the parameter associated to Profarma access is positive and
signiﬁcant, we ﬁnd evidence of crowding in eﬀects of Profarma on the intensive
margin of ﬁrms’ innovation investments. Such evidence would thus corroborate
with the view that ﬁrms face ﬁnancing constraints to fund innovation investment.
The main endogeneity problems come from the fact that we do not have a

random or experimental sample of treated companies.
ﬁrms self-select themselves into application to Profarma treatment based on both
observables and unobservables factors. Additionality, BNDES carries out a risk
analysis to select applicants into treatment.

Firms’ access to Profarma loans is positively correlated with observable factors
associated to companies’ performance and a low-risky proﬁle, like company size,
EBITDA, low debt level, and so on. Firms’ access is also positively correlated with
unobserved time-invariant factors, like the ability of the entrepreneurs (or board) of
the company, and unobserved time-varying factors as, for example, ﬁrms’ expected
proﬁts associated to its innovation plan. As a result, treated units suﬀers from
positive selection bias, causing overestimation of Profarma eﬀects (Angrist and
Pischke, 2008).

The empirical strategy adopted to reduce the selection bias problem is trying to
control for those factors that determines selection into treatment. We used a Fixed
Eﬀect (FE) model to control for both the time-varying observable components
available in Pintec’s data11 and the all the time-invariant unobservable components
that aﬀect selection. In addition, the ﬁxed eﬀect term of the model allows us to
control also for all the observed but ﬁxed determinants of those decisions.

Nevertheless, the FE model is a suitable estimator for the case in which most of
the selection on unobservables problem comes from omitted but ﬁxed individual
components (Angrist and Pischke, 2008).
In our case, it is hard to think that
time varying unobservable components, as the expected return associated to the

11Ideally, we should include balance-sheet components to control for company’s risk, but un-
fortunately those variables are not available in Pintec’s survey. Our results however are robust to
several diﬀerent speciﬁcation on the set of controls variables and then we chose more parsimonious
ones.

12

company’s innovation plan, would not be of concern in terms of selection bias.
Thus, we interpret our FE estimates as an intermediate step in the seek of more
causal evidence.

We estimate Profarma eﬀects on innovation investment outcomes based on

Equation 1.

Yit = βP rof armait + X(cid:48)

itγ + αi + ρt + it

(1)

where Yit is a measure of ﬁrm’s innovation expenditures in year t and P rof armait
is a dummy variable that assumes 1 if ﬁrm i had access to Profarma in year s <= t
and 0 otherwise. This deﬁnition of the treatment dummy implies that the correla-
tions estimated by β captures simultaneously contemporaneous and lagged eﬀects
of Profarma.12 Additionally, X(cid:48)
it is a vector of control variables that includes a
measure of ﬁrm size, Log(Employment), a measure of productivity, Log(Labor
Productivity), and the Financing Obstacles dummy, to control for ﬁnancing con-
straints. αi is the individual-speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀects, ρt is year-speciﬁc eﬀects and it
is the error term.

7 Results

This section presents the estimates of Profarma eﬀects on several innovation out-
comes of the pharmaceutical companies ﬁnanced. We show ﬁrstly the estimates
for the RDE and IRDE variables, once those are the primary focus of the pro-
gram. After that, we comment on the estimates for the remaining desegregated
innovation expenditures variables.

Table 3 reports Profarma estimates for the R&D outcomes considered. We
present basic OLS references for each variable, followed by FE estimates. The
ﬁrst FE estimates does not include the Financing obstacles dummy, added in our
preferred speciﬁcation (columns 3 and 6), to control for ﬁnancial constraints.

We see ﬁrstly that Profarma estimates are positive and signiﬁcant for the OLS
basic estimates and are quantitatively large (around 80%) for both the RDE and
IRDE variables. The FE estimates for the RDE variable, however, despite being
positive, are not signiﬁcant. For the other side, the FE estimates for the IRDE
outcome are positive and signiﬁcant and also sizeable. The FE estimate for our
preferred speciﬁcation (column 6) shows that Profarma supported companies in-
vested roughly 76% more in internal R&D activities than non-supported ones. The
positive eﬀects found for IRDE are of very importance from the point of view of

12Although we recognize the possibility of lagged eﬀects, we were not interested at this version

of the paper in separating those eﬀects in the speciﬁcation employed.

of internal R&D capabilities were of primary priority.

Table 4 shows Profarma estimates for the innovation eﬀorts outcomes not re-
lated to R&D. We note Profarma has positive and signiﬁcant eﬀects (at the 10%
level) on Total Innovation Expenditures (TIE) of the pharmaceutical companies
supported, for our preferred FE speciﬁcation (column 3). The size of the eﬀect is
about 60%, lower than the one found for the IRDE variable, but still substantial.
Still, the FE estimated coeﬃcients of Profarma for the other two variables,
Other Expenditures (OE) and Equipment Expenditures (EE), were not signiﬁ-
cant. This indicates that Profarma ﬁnancing were not able to impact signiﬁcantly
complementary innovation expenditures of supported companies, although, as ex-
pected, it was able to raise total innovation investments.

In sum, the results presented in this section give support to the view that
Profarma was an eﬀective program to support innovation eﬀorts on the Brazilian
pharmaceutical sector. From the point of view of the intervention logic of the of
the program, its incentives were designed to stimulate ﬁrms’ innovation invest-
ments and mainly the within-company one as discussed in Section 3. The positive
eﬀects found for the IRDE variable indicates that, in the absence of the program,
pharmaceutical ﬁrms would have had a lower level of R&D investment. This result
can also be interpreted as evidence of input additionality of Profarma, associated
to crowding-in eﬀects on IRDE.

Nevertheless, we need to further investigate the absence of eﬀects on total RDE.
The fact that the IRDE mean on the treaded sample represents roughly 80% of the
RDE mean, as show in Section 5, raises the question why we did not ﬁnd positive
and signiﬁcant eﬀects also on the RDE variable. One possible investigation is
to estimate Profarma eﬀects on External RDE (ERDE), to see if there exist a
substitution eﬀect driving the pattern of results obtained.13

8 Conclusion

This paper is the ﬁrst one to evaluate a speciﬁc Brazilian sectoral program aimed
to develop R&D capabilities in supported companies in a technology intensive
sector, the pharmaceutical one. Moreover, it uses a comprehensive desegregated
set of outcome variable to estimate impacts of Profarma on innovation eﬀorts of
companies supported.

The paper contributes to the literature of industrial policy evaluation and to
the innovation ﬁnancing literature. Furthermore, it evaluates a relevant sectoral
program in terms of volume of ﬁnancing, with clear links to other public policies
to the sector, and with structured goals.
In addition, the program lasted for
roughly 12 years, which gave us a large period for the evaluation in a context
of continuous improvement of the intervention (the program went through three
revisions in the period). With all those elements together, the present evaluation
has a considerable potential for institutional learning. Also, it is worthy from the
point of view of transparency and accountability of the public policies executed by

13This variable, despite available in Pintec, were not included in the analysis as it was not an

explicit outcome of the program.

BNDES.

The main conclusion is that Profarma was relevant to determine the level of
internal R&D investment of companies supported - its targeted below-market loans
were positively correlated with internal R&D intensity in pharmaceutical ﬁrms.
This means that the program was eﬀective in terms of its goals, although we cannot
yet say anything about its costs. It is noteworthy that we ﬁnd signiﬁcant results in
a context of very low sample of treated companies. Also, the obtained evidence is
of particular relevance as it is the ﬁrst one in the Brazilian literature of industrial
policy evaluation for the pharmaceutical sector. In addition, as the pharmaceutical
sector is a technology intensive industry, the observation of such positive eﬀects
seems to be especially relevant in the context of a developing country as Brazil.

In terms of policy implications, the results indicate that special ﬁnancing condi-
tions in terms of interests and risk policy present in the program may all have had
its contribution to the obtained evidence, although we cannot say which ﬂexibility
introduced by the program mattered more.

This was the ﬁrst set of results about Profarma eﬀectiveness. Future research
agenda is concerned about expanding the set of variables to include eﬀects on in-
novation sales and ﬁrm growth. On the other side, it is important to produce esti-
mates of the economic costs of the program, so we can discuss its cost-eﬀectiveness.
Finally, it would be very important try to understand the way the underlying ﬁ-
nancing conditions relate to the eﬀects.
