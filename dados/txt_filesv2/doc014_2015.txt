Abstract

The purpose of this paper was to estimate the impacts of the port procedures time on Brazilian exports.
The study uses an innovative database with municipal exports, with distinction over the port used and
with aggregated products according to the harmonized system in 4 digits for the period from 2010 to
2012. To achieve the goal, we use an adapted difference gravity equation in order to explore the time
variations of port procedures for 16 Brazilian ports. The estimation results indicate that, in general,
each additional hour in the conduction of the port procedures represent costs to the Brazilian exporters,
which may be reﬂected in loss of competitiveness of the domestic products abroad. According to the
estimates made, each additional hour of the ship stay in the median port is equivalent to a reduction of
the municipal exports in around 2%. Besides that, a reduction of 10% in time of stay for a ship in port
can increase the number of exported product categories in 1%.

Resumo

O objetivo deste artigo foi estimar os impactos do tempo dos procedimentos portuários sobre as ex-
portações brasileiras. O trabalho parte de uma base de dados inovadora com dados de exportações
municipais, com distinção do porto utilizado, e com produtos agregados de acordo com o sistema har-
monizado em 4 dígitos para o período de 2010 a 2012. Para atingir o objetivo, este artigo faz uso de
uma equação gravitacional em diferenças adaptada que explora variações do tempo dos procedimen-
tos portuários para 16 portos brasileiros. Os resultados das estimações indicam que, de modo geral,
cada hora adicional na condução dos procedimentos portuários representam custos para os exportado-
res brasileiros, que podem estar se reﬂetindo em perda da competitividade dos produtos nacionais no
exterior. Segundo as estimações realizadas, cada hora adicional de estadia no porto mediano é equi-
valente a uma redução do volume total das exportações municipais em cerca de 2%. Além disso, uma
redução de 10% no tempo de estadia relativo do navio no porto pode aumentar o número de categorias
de produtos exportados em torno de 1%.

1 Introduction

Among the various elements that compose the level of trade facilitation of a country, the port infras-
tructure, as well as the efﬁciency of the customs procedures is among the most important in determining
the ﬁnal cost of an exported good. In fact, ports are the main gateway used by countries to access global
trade. According to the International Chamber of Shipping, around 90% of world trade is carried by the in-
ternational shipping industry. This importance is also highlighted on the academic literature. For instance,
according to Clark et al. (2004), the activities required at port level are sometimes crucial for international
trade transactions. Particularly in Brazil, this pattern is not different. According to data from the Brazilian
Ministry of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade - MDIC, between 2004 and 2013, around 82.6% of
the total value and 95.8% of the weight from Brazilian exports were conducted through ports.

Despite this relative great importance of Brazilian ports in its trade ﬂows, its infrastructure and or-
ganization are very far from the quality and efﬁciency practiced by countries with high levels of trade
facilitation. Using the World Economic Forum indicator of “Quality of Port Infrastructure”,1 it is possible
to delineate a ranking of countries according to their port quality and efﬁciency (Appendix A.1). Con-
sidering this information for 2013, Brazil was the 130𝑡ℎ country in a 148-countries ranking. Furthermore,
according to data from the National Agency for Waterway Transportation, in 2012, 56.2% of the total time
required for a ship to complete an average port procedure was wasted on either waiting to dock, or wait-
ing to initiate the operations. These numbers suggest that Brazil present a high level of port procedures
inefﬁciency. Thus, it is very important that the academic literature presents estimations of the impacts of
policies that aim to improve the Brazilian ports, either by investing in infrastructure or stimulating port ef-
ﬁciency. This study aligns with this necessity, since we provide estimates of the impacts of port procedures
time on Brazilian volume of exports and on the number of categories of products exported.2

Considering the signiﬁcant growth of the volume of traded goods and services among the countries,
along with the reductions of traditional barriers to trade, such as tariff rates, the relative importance of trade
facilitation aspects as determinants of the costs associated to international trade is growing. While the
traditional barriers dwindled, other trade obstacles, such as transportation costs, administrative hindrance
and efﬁciency of port procedures grew rapidly in importance in determining the traded goods’ ﬁnal cost.
As a result, trade facilitation has been highlighted, both in WTO3 round of negotiations, and in the planning
guidelines for policies that aim to promote international trade.

In this context, trade facilitation literature is relatively recent and the number of empirical studies that
aims to estimate the impacts of trade cost reductions on trade ﬂows is increasing. Considering this incipient
literature, most of the empirical works use two different approaches to measure trade facilitation. On one
hand, studies such as Wilson et al. (2005), Portugal-Perez and Wilson (2010) and Khan and Kalirajan
(2011) use the construction of indexes or indicators that incorporate different dimensions of the trade
facilitation in a small group of variables. On the other hand, there are works such as Limao and Venables
(2001), Sadikov (2007), and Mesquita Moreira et al. (2008) that measure the trade facilitation through

1This indicator measures the country businessman’s overall perception of their port installments. This information is available
in the annual report “Global Competitiveness Report”, and in the World Bank database.
2The choice of whether to use Brazil for this study is justiﬁed by the geographical feature of the country. In fact, Brazil is a
country of continental dimensions and has a large number of ports with signiﬁcant trade volumes. This ensures data variability
in terms of products and trade partners which can not be found in many countries.
3At WTO, the discussions over the trade facilitation are relatively recent. According to WTO (2013), trade facilitation has
become an ofﬁcial discussion topic at the Ministerial Conference in Singapore, in December of 1996. At the occasion, an-
alytical and exploratory studies on the simpliﬁcation of trade procedures were recommended, in order to assess WTO role
in the conduction of agreements in the area. Afterwards, the topic was included in the discussion agenda at Doha Round in
November, 2001, when the ministers agreed to hold the negotiations on trade facilitation after the Ministerial Conference of
Cancun in September, 2003. In August of 2004, WTO General Council unanimously decided to begin the negotiations on
the modalities agreed by its members. Those modalities established the basis for the work plan adopted at the Negotiating
Group ﬁrst meeting, in November of 2004. Throughout the past recent years, detailed negotiations were often hold, and the
negotiating text was improved and simpliﬁed until it was ﬁnally approved unanimously, during the Ministerial Conference of
Bali in 2013.

speciﬁc variables, aiming for an analysis of isolated aspects.4

For each method of measurement of trade facilitation there are advantages and disadvantages. The
main advantage of the construction of aggregated indexes refers to the synthesis of the facilitation charac-
teristics in deﬁned aspects. This technique reduces the problems caused by the strong correlation expected
among some of the facilitation variables, leading to better estimates and facilitating the econometric anal-
ysis, when it is desired to identify and estimate the overall impact of the trade facilitation. Sometimes,
the aggregation of variables in general indexes makes it impossible to analyze the impact of speciﬁc trade
facilitation issues on trade. Therefore, the great advantage of using speciﬁc measures of trade facilitation
is the direct interpretation of the estimated impacts of those variables on the trade ﬂows. Indeed, for public
policy directed to stimulate trade ﬂows, the use of this approach enables the straight interpretation of the
impact of speciﬁc actions aimed to reduce speciﬁc trading costs.

Within this second group of empirical studies, there is a growing literature specialized in estimating the
impact of time on trade ﬂows. The idea of time as a trade barrier is relatively new in the academic literature.
Hummels (2001) is considered the ﬁrst to highlight the importance of time to trade as a barrier to exports
and imports, identifying the costs related to the slowness of shipping, compared to air transportation,
and its implication on trade patterns and the global organization of production. Since Hummels (2001)
ﬁndings, the required time to transport a product from a country to another has became an evident barrier
to trade, and its importance could not be ignored anymore. Evans and Harrigan (2005) highlights the
importance of time in determining trade patterns between the countries. For that, it is the ﬁrst to build a
solid and careful micro-foundation for the demand for timeliness and to present empirical evidences on its
importance. Harrigan and Venables (2006) presents additional evidence of the importance of transportation
time by analyzing its impacts through uncertainties on the delivery time. The results show that the demand
for smaller uncertainties on the delivery time of ﬁnal or intermediate goods is one of the reasons why the
manufacturing plants present a spatial agglomeration.

After empirical evidence that the time to transport goods between two countries consists in a barrier
to trade, other authors presented additional evidence that not only the transportation time may affect trade
ﬂows, but the time needed to perform all the administrative requirements, inspections, purchase of licenses,
and transportation of goods from the industry gate to the port, has also an important role in determining
the trade ﬂows. Nordas (2006) contributes to the literature by bringing this wider notion of the impacts
of the time on the trade ﬂows. In a wider picture, the time of trade process may reﬂect other aspects of
trade facilitation, such as the infrastructure as a whole, the port efﬁciency, the transparency in the custom,
among others.

Djankov et al. (2010) also adopts this wider notion of time as a trade barrier. However, it contributes to
the literature by using a new methodology to reduce econometric problems from endogeneity. The authors
use a gravitational equation in difference, in order to reduce problems arising from endogeneity, as far as
the effects of the trade volume on the time are probably similar between countries that are in the same
geographic region. Therefore, assuming a speciﬁcation in differences would eliminate all common factors
in both localities, including endogenous effects that are equal between near regions. This methodology
allows assessing the effect of the delays on the relative exports of countries with similar geographical
characteristics, endowment, and that face the same tariff rates in the importer countries.

Therefore, the literature indicates that time is an important determinant of trade ﬂows. Most of the
studies aim to estimate the effect of the transportation time or total time to complete all the trade process
on the trade ﬂows. The literature present evidence that delays on the time to transport a product from the
port to the importer country or on the time to complete the whole export/import procedure diminishes the
volume of bilateral trade (intensive margin), and reduces the number of ﬁrms and production sectors that
participate in international trade (extensive margin).

4Limao and Venables (2001) is concerned with the participation of the infrastructure in determining the costs of transportation
and, therefore, highlights the importance of investments in infrastructure for the incentive of trade ﬂows. Sadikov (2007) adopts
variables related to the bureaucracy to measure the trade facilitation of the border and inside the border. While Mesquita Mor-
eira et al. (2008) is concerned with transport costs impact on trade ﬂows.

3

Nevertheless, no studies were found that perform an analysis of the effects of delays particularly in port
procedures on international trade. So this study aligns with this group of studies, and contributes to the
literature by giving new empirical evidence of the importance of the port procedures delays, speciﬁcally,
on trade ﬂows. Therefore, we use an innovative database, with exports from Brazilian cities, with products
aggregated at four-digit Harmonized System (HS) over the period of 2010 to 2012, in order to estimate
the impacts of the total stay time of a ship in the port on Brazilian exports, assessing which stages of
the port procedures contributes more to this impact. We draw information on port procedures time from
the Brazilian National Agency of Water Transportation (ANTAQ). These variables are measured in hours
and present the mean time that a port takes to handle a complete procedure of importation or exportation
of standard containers, since the arrival of the ship on the port anchoring area, until the moment it is
undocked.

The database constructed for this study has several advantages over commonly used in the literature
data. Most studies found in the literature are performed with cross-section data. The panel data allow the
estimation of ﬁxed effects, eliminating all costs invariant in time that could affect the export of a particular
locality and that could bias the estimates due to its omission on the estimated equations.

Another advantage of the database refers to its high level of detail. The database built for this study is
detailed by exporting municipality, product category, destination country and port used, allowing the use
of a difference gravity model. The adoption of this strategy enables to control for several unobservable
factors that can affect municipal exports. Moreover, such an approach may also reduce problems arising
from the possible endogeneity between time measures and the exported volume.

The results indicate that, in general, each additional hour in the conduction of port procedures repre-
sents costs to Brazilian exporters, which may be reﬂected in a loss of competitiveness of domestic products
abroad. According to the estimates made, each additional hour of the ship stay in the median port is equiv-
alent to a reduction of the municipal exports in around 2%. Besides that, a reduction of 10% in time of
stay for a ship in port can increase the number of exported product categories around 1%.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data and develops the empiri-
cal strategy used in this study. Section 3 presents the descriptive analysis, the empirical results and the
sensibility tests followed by ﬁnal remarks.

2 Methodology
2.1 Data

We use an innovative database built for this study of municipal exports, with distinction over the port
used, country of destination, and with products aggregated at four-digit Harmonized System (HS) for the
period from 2010 to 2012. The option for this period was due the availability of the data.

Brazilian cities exports were obtained from the AliceWeb System, developed by the National Secre-
tariat of Foreign Trade (SECEX) of the Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC) in
Brazil. Information was collected from 2010 to 2012 detailed to the product category (four-digit Harmo-
nized System (HS) level) to the ports,5 and in the goods origin cities. In total, export data were obtained
from 1,876 Brazilian municipalities, destined for 204 countries that used 16 Brazilian ports. Note that the
information used comprise only municipalities which exported products aggregated at four-digit Harmo-
nized System (HS) level, and have done so using one of the selected sample ports. Furthermore, due to the
empirical strategy, the estimations were realized with a subset of the main sample.

We selected 16 Brazilian ports to compose the analysis database: Belém – PA, Fortaleza – CE, Imbituba
– SC, Itajaí – SC, Itaqui – MA, Paranaguá – PR, Rio de Janeiro – RJ, Rio Grande – RS, Salvador – BA,
Santarém – PA, Santos – SP, São Francisco do Sul – SC, Itaguaí (Sepetiba) – RJ, Suape – PE, Vila do

5According to AliceWeb System, the port is deﬁned as the last location in the country where the goods were dispatched to
destination countries.

Conde – PA e Vitória – ES. The ﬁgure 1 presents these ports geographical location.

Figure 1: Ports examined - Geographical Location

These ports selection was made based on the availability of the data, and in its relative importance
for the Brazilian trade. The ports selected to compose the sample are responsible for most part of the
international trade in Brazil. According to data from the AliceWeb system, considering the period between
2010 and 2012, these ports were responsible for around 77.6% of the total Brazilian exports, and around
92.7% of the exports by shipping.

The Gross Domestic Product data of the Brazilian cities were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Information about the average income of workers from the auxiliary
activities of waterway transport sector in the cities were the ports are installed were collected from the
Annual Information Relation (Relação Anual de Informações - RAIS) platform.

The distances between cities were calculated from the latitude and longitude of each location. The
cities and ports latitude and longitude data were draw using the R software, with the geocode routine of
the package ggmap.6 For each pair of locations, the geographical distance was calculated in kilometers
based on Great Circles distances using the Spherical Law of Cosine.7

We draw information on port procedures time from the Brazilian National Agency of Water Trans-
portation (ANTAQ). These variables are measured in hours and present the average time that a port takes
to handle a complete procedure of importation or exportation of a standard container, since the arrival of
the ship on the port, until the moment it is undocked. The ﬁgure 2 illustrates the information collected.

The total time of stay on ﬁgure 2 refers to the total length of time that it is take to complete the trade
procedure at the port, from the arrival of the ship to the area of anchoring to the moment the ship is
undocked. This total time of stay, in turn, can be broken down into four steps: Waiting time for docking,
waiting time for initiate the operations, operation time and time to undock. The docking time, reﬂects

7To measure the distance more accurately we applied the Spherical Law of Cosine to calculate the great-circle distance 𝑑
between two points, in the following manner:

𝑑 = 𝑅 𝑎𝑟𝑐𝑠𝑒𝑛 [𝑠𝑒𝑛(𝜄1)𝑠𝑒𝑛(𝜄2) + 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜄1)𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜄2)𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜆1 − 𝜆2)]

(1)

Where 𝜄1 and 𝜄2 are latitudes and 𝜆1 and 𝜆2 are longitudes of two points in a sphere with radius R. To the calculation of
distance we used 𝑅 = 6.371 km, that is accepted as the mean value of Earth’s radius.

2.2 Analitical model and empirical strategy

In order to estimate the impact of time of port procedures on municipal exports, basically two different
methodologies could be used: a model of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) or a gravity model.
According to Shepherd (2013), the CGE models are more indicated for analyzes that focus on estimate
impacts on the economic welfare, labor and capital reallocation across sectors. In such cases, the gravity
model would not be an appropriate methodology. According to the author, the comparative advantage in
the use of the gravity model is to evaluate the sensitivity of trade ﬂows in response to speciﬁc factors of
trade costs, including policy effects.

Therefore, our approach derives from a traditional gravity equation. Gravity models have been widely
used in the literature to estimate aggregate effects on trade of tariff and non-tariff measures and cost
reductions associated with trade facilitation. Among these studies, are Wilson et al. (2005), Helble et al.
(2007) and Shepherd and Wilson (2009). The standard gravitational model used in the literature can be
represented by the following equation:

)︃1−𝜎

(︃ 𝜑𝑗,𝑖

𝑄𝑖𝑄𝑗

𝑋𝑗,𝑖 = 𝑌𝑖𝑌𝑗
𝑌

(2)

Where 𝑋𝑗,𝑖 represents the exportations from region 𝑗 to region 𝑖; 𝑌𝑖 is the importer country income
and represents the demand for goods from the importer country. 𝑌𝑗 is the exporting capacity of country
𝑗. 𝑌 represents the world production. 𝜑𝑗,𝑖 is the factor that represents all trade costs between 𝑗 and 𝑖. 𝜎
is the elasticity of substitution between products. Indexes 𝑄𝑖 and 𝑄𝑗 represent price indexes, also being
identiﬁed in the literature as the multilateral resistance. These indexes express that the bilateral trade ﬂows
depend on the existing trade costs between the two countries, but also on trade costs associated with other
trade partners.

This standard speciﬁcation of the gravity model considers data at the country level. Considering the
database collected for analysis, and the objective of estimating the time impacts of port procedures on
exports from Brazil, the model can be directly adapted to disaggregated data for exporter municipalities,

From this equation, considering the purpose of the study, it is necessary to establish a speciﬁcation for
the cost term 𝜑𝑘
𝑚,𝑖,𝑡 affecting the trade ﬂow of Brazilian municipalities and to consider all factors affecting
the export procedure, including the time of port procedures. To better meet this need, it was held one
𝑚,𝑖,𝑡. Therefore, a feature of the study data was essential to allow such
decomposition of the cost term 𝜑𝑘
decomposition. Export data of Brazilian municipalities were obtained with distinction of the port used to
𝑚,𝑝,𝑖,𝑡,
make the transport of the traded goods. From this, trade costs can be represented by the new term 𝜑𝑘
where 𝑝 denotes the port used to export, and by the following decomposition in three components that
incorporate all trade facilitation elements:

𝑙𝑛(𝜑𝑘

Where 𝜇𝑘

𝑚,𝑝,𝑖,𝑡) = 𝑙𝑛(𝜇𝑘

𝑚,𝑝,𝑡 represents the set of variables that reﬂect any cost factor between the exporter city 𝑚
and the port 𝑝, such as the distance between the city and the port, the quality and availability of transport
infrastructure (roads and railways, for example), and comparative advantages on the production of some
goods. 𝜔𝑝,𝑡 is a set of variables that reﬂect the characteristics of the port used for export, such as the
quality and efﬁciency of customs procedures, including the time required to perform each step of the
𝑝,𝑖,𝑡 is the set of variables representing costs during the trading process between the
procedure. Finally, 𝜓𝑘
port 𝑝 and destination country 𝑖 in the year 𝑡, such as the distance between the port and the country, and
other characteristics of the importer country. The next ﬁgure illustrates this decomposition:

Figure 3: Decomposition of trade costs

Similarly to Khan and Kalirajan (2011) deﬁnitions, the variables represented by 𝜇𝑘

𝑚,𝑝,𝑡 consist primar-
ily of elements from “behind the border” trade facilitation, while 𝜓𝑘
𝑝,𝑖,𝑡 refers to the elements “beyond the
border”. However, 𝜔𝑝,𝑡 reﬂects speciﬁcally all the aspects of the “frontier” because it captures trade facil-
itation characteristics inherent to ports. In this case, the empirical speciﬁcation takes the following form:

𝑙𝑛(𝑋 𝑘

8The speciﬁcation log-log is widely used in the literature related to the gravity model, as in the works of Wilson et al. (2005),
Helble et al. (2007) and Shepherd and Wilson (2009).

The study hypothesis to be tested is that time delays in performing the export procedure on each
Brazilian port imply in additional costs to exporters. According to the theoretical model, the possibly
higher cost is reﬂected in lower trade ﬂows. However, in order to test this hypothesis, it is necessary to
consider the problems arising from the omitted variables of the aspects of trade facilitation “behind” and
“beyond” the border.

According to the constructed model, it is necessary to include in the equation to be estimated costs
that represent various factors throughout the international trade process. However, some of these factors,
especially those related to the facilitation term “behind the border”, 𝜇𝑘
𝑚,𝑝,𝑡, and “beyond the border”,
𝑝,𝑖, are unobservable or difﬁcult to measure accurately for different cities and countries in the sample.
𝜓𝑘
The omission of these factors could lead to biased estimates of the coefﬁcients of the port procedures
time variables. Given these potential problems, the study builds an identiﬁcation strategy based on the
development of hypotheses about the trade facilitation elements and on the construction of a difference
gravity model.

Considering the “behind the border” facilitation elements, 𝜇𝑘

𝑚,𝑝,𝑡, the study uses a similar approach
to Djankov et al. (2010), in which a gravity equation in differences is estimated. The study estimates a
gravity equation in which the variables are calculated as the ratio of two observations regarding the exports
of two countries located in a same geographic region. However, differently from what was done by the
authors, in this study, the ratios are built considering municipalities instead of countries. The aim of the
adoption of this strategy is to eliminate the need to control for regional factors that could affect the volume
of exports of a given municipality.

In this case, the difference in the gravitational model is held between observations regarding munic-
ipalities located geographically close. The construction of these groups should be conducted so that the
facilitation features “behind the border” observed for the municipalities of a same group are similar. For
the construction of these groups of municipalities we used the hierarchical cluster analysis, using the
geographical distance as the dissimilarity variable between municipalities.9

By using the approach of construction of ratios from municipalities located sufﬁciently close, so that
the trade facilitation characteristics “behind the border” may be considered the same, we eliminate the need
to control for these factors that could affect the exports of municipalities. Therefore, the ﬁrst identifying
hypothesis of the model is that municipalities belonging to the same cluster share the same characteristics
in terms of regional trade facilitation, such as the business environment, infrastructure in general, and any
other local factor.

However, just this strategy is not sufﬁcient to eliminate all unobservable components of the term 𝜇𝑘

𝑚,𝑝,𝑡.
Therefore, this strategy should be complemented by a second identifying hypothesis, according to which,
given two cities belonging to the same cluster, the components of 𝜇𝑘
𝑚,𝑝,𝑡 that differ for two distinct ports
are invariant in the short term.10

Therefore, controlling for the factors speciﬁc to the municipalities by clustering them, and adding the
hypothesis that aspects between the port and the municipalities of the same cluster do not vary from year
to year, so if a ﬁxed effects model is estimated, the term of trade facilitation “behind the border”, 𝜇𝑘
𝑚,𝑝,𝑡,
can be eliminated from the equation.

In order to control for the elements of trade facilitation “beyond the border”, we made an additional
restriction to the ratios. In fact, we restrict the ratios to be calculated only with observations which the
country of destination is the same. This approach was also used by Djankov et al. (2010) and eliminate the
need to include trade facilitation terms “beyond the border”, 𝜓𝑘
𝑝,𝑖. Therefore, incorporating to the model
the assumptions about the facilitation elements “behind the border” and “beyond the border”, and making

9The Cluster analysis is a multivariate statistical procedure whose primary purpose is to look for patterns in the data to identify
relatively homogeneous subgroups between observations called clusters. In this case, we used the hierarchical cluster, with
the Average Linkage agglomeration method. We also considered a limit of 40 kilometers as the criterion for the realization of
the cluster.
10Here it is assumed that from one year to the other trade facilitation “behind the border” involving the exporter municipality
and the port used does not change. This assumption is reasonable towards regional infrastructure. For instance, investments
in construction of a new railway, linking a particular region and a speciﬁc port usually takes several years to be accomplished.

We also opted for the creation of the ratios between municipal observations that export the same prod-
uct, but which have made their exports through different ports. This option allows the control of intrinsic
characteristics to each category of products that are not observed, such as the elasticity of substitution,
eliminating bias arising from the omission of these variables.11

delays effects only for the municipalities that already export, has several advantages of the econometric
point of view. In addition to eliminate non-observable components, the approach also allows the reduction
of endogeneity problems between the characteristics of trade facilitation and Brazilian exports. Under
the assumption that investments in trade facilitation “behind the border” occur on a regional scale, so
that geographically close cities equally beneﬁt from it, then the use of ratios calculated for municipal
observations belonging to a same cluster eliminates the presence of endogeneity between the volume of
municipal and trade aspects “behind the border”. Additionally, as the ratio is performed with data ports
and cities of a same country, in this case Brazil, any endogenous channel between time costs and volume
of trade that may affect the results on a national scale, is also eliminated.

From this model, the econometric speciﬁcation adopted to estimate the impact of time of port pro-
cedures on Brazilian exports involves the collected variables described in section 2.1. Usually empirical
studies use GDP as a measure of the income of the countries involved in bilateral trade. However, in the
case of a disaggregated model for municipal data, GDP would possibly not be the best variable to be used
to capture the term of export capacity of the city.12 In order to better capture this term, we used the export
coefﬁcient of municipalities, calculated as the ratio of the total exported by each municipality in a given
sector and the municipal GDP in a given year 𝑡.

Finally, the trade facilitation term of “border” elements should include the characteristics of Brazilian
ports. Therefore, we include in the equation the number of dockings, the cost of port usage13 and variables
of time of port procedures. Therefore, the empirical equation can be written as follows:

11We restricted the ratios to be calculated only between observations referred to different cities (belonging to a same cluster)

and different ports, but to a same importer country and related to a same product category.

12This can be explained by the fact that municipalities usually have a much more limited range of production sectors than a
country. In addition, growth in local GDP will be associated with greater trade ﬂows only if the growth occurs in the export
sector. If the growth of municipal income is strongly linked to the service sector, for example, the municipal income may not
affect the municipal exports.

13We included in the equation the average income of workers from the auxiliary activities of waterway transport sector in the
cities were the ports are installed. This variable was used to control for the cost of port usage. In fact, the price a port charges
the exporter can be an important determinant of which port will be used for the exportation procedure. However, this type
of information is dispersed and difﬁcult to obtain with precision for all the sample ports. Therefore, we used the average
income as a rough measure of this cost. Implicitly we are assuming that the ports which have higher port charges, are located
in municipalities whose salaries paid to employees in water transport auxiliary activities are also higher.

𝑚1,𝑚2,𝑝1,𝑝2,𝑖,𝑡 is a random
error term. The estimates made were based on four basic speciﬁcations, in which different measures of
time were inserted into the equation in order to better estimate the impact of the various steps of the port
procedure.

According to Nordas (2006), the time to transport goods, or to complete the trade procedure may
have effects on exports at the extensive and intensive margins of trade. Therefore, time represent costs to
exporters, which can affect both the volume of exported products (intensive margin) and the number of
sectors and ﬁrms participating in the international trade (extensive margin). In this sense, two measures of
exports were used as dependent variables in the equations presented before.

The ﬁrst was the volume exported in dollars. Equations with this dependent variable result in estimates
of the impact of port procedures time variables on the intensive margin of trade. In this case, we estimate
the effect of reductions in port procedures time on the intensity of trade volumes. These estimations
consider only those cities that are already exporters and the products that are already exported.

We do not intended to perform a rigorous analysis of the effects of time of port procedures on the
extensive margin of trade. Accordingly, no probability model was estimated, as this type of analysis
usually is performed in the literature. Instead, we adopts a similar approach to Moreira et al. (2013),
where the number of exported products is used as the dependent variable in place of the exported value.

In this sense, the second measure used as the dependent variable was the number of categories of
exported products. At this stage, the goal is to analyze to what extent the time of port procedures can
affect the diversiﬁcation of exports. This variable was measured as the total number of different product
categories aggregated by the Common Nomenclature of MERCOSUR - NCM in 8 digits.14 In this case,
the ratios were calculated as the number of products categories NCM-8 digits in a given HS-2 digits for
two cities in a same cluster, for a same country, and using two different ports.

3 Results
3.1 Port procedures and time

In order to better delineate the proﬁle of each port of the sample, we present their relative importance
to Brazilian trade. Figure 4 present the total volume of exports of each port of the sample during the period
from 2010 to 2012.

According to the ﬁgure, Santos is the Brazilian port with higher exports volume (around US$ 64 billion
in 2012). All the other ports can be divided into three groups. Vitória, Sepetiba, Paranaguá, Itaqui and
Rio Grande can be considered as ports with high volume of exports, ranging from 10 to 30 billion dollars.
Itajaí, Rio de Janeiro, Vila do Conde, Salvador and São Francisco do Sul can be considered ports with
moderate volume of exports ranging from 3 to 9 billion dollar. Finally, Suape, Santarém, Fortaleza, Belém
and Imbituba are ports of low volume of exports, with less than 1 billion dollar. Despite this low volume
compared to the other ports of the sample, these ports are considered in the analysis due to their regional
importance or to the products they usually export.

Considering the time variables of port procedures, it is possible to characterize each port of the sample
according to its efﬁciency in the conduction of trade procedures. The time that each port takes to complete
each stage of the trade process may reﬂect the trade facilitation characteristics of the port, such as the port
infrastructure quality, or the ports bureaucracy and other features that may affect the time to complete a
standard procedure.

14Although we do not estimate an effect of time on port on the likelihood of new companies and productive sectors enter the
international market as exporters, the results present the effects of time on the diversiﬁcation of exports. In this sense, the
results can be interpreted as evidence of the effects of time in port on the extensive margin of trade.

Figure 4: Brazilian Ports - Total exported in US$ billions from 2010 to 2012

The ﬁrst relevant information to characterize the ports is the total time of stay (also called turnaround
time), which consists in the time spent from the moment in which the ship arrives in the port until it is
undocking. The ﬁgure 5 presents the time of stay of each port throughout the years of the sample.15

According to the information from ﬁgure 5, Imbituba and Rio de Janeiro may be considered the most
agile ports, or those with the lowest time of stay. On the other hand, São Francisco do Sul stands out as
the most time consuming, and can take more than 70 hours to complete the entire port procedure. It is also
worth noting that, during the analyzed period, only Itaqui, Paranaguá, Suape, Itajaí, and Imbituba reduced
their total time of stay. This result points out to a latent need of investment on the Brazilian ports that are,
at each year, taking more time to execute the exportation and importation of goods.

Table 1 presents additional information related to the time variable in the sample ports. According
to the information, the Brazilian ports from the sample present an average stay time of 28 hours and 12

15Three adjustments were made in the time database for the presence of outliers. Verifying the monthly data, ports from
Salvador, in April 2011, Paranaguá, in March 2011, and Fortaleza, in August 2012, presented stay time data excessively
above their monthly averages, affecting the annual value of this measure. Thus, it was made a substitution of the monthly
observations affected by the monthly average of each port, for the calculation of the annual time measure of these ports.

Table 1 also provides information related to the variation in sample ports times. While there are ports
with no ineffectiveness time, there are other ports in which the maximum waiting time is 60 hours and 12
minutes, with the ship waiting to dock or to start the operation. Regarding the operation time, the results
also vary a lot between ports. While the most agile port spends 4 hours and 24 minutes to perform the
operations, the slowest one takes around 44 hours to perform the same stage of the procedure.

For a better understanding of the composition of the stay time, ﬁgure 6 presents the information of
each stage of the sample ports trading process over the analyzed period. Each graph bar represents a year
of the sample in the sequence from 2010 to 2012, and each stage of the procedure is added equally to the
stay time.

Figure 6: Brazilian ports - Average time of each step of the port procedure

Each stage varies a lot between the sample port, and over the sample years as well. Indeed, the oper-
ation time captures the efﬁciency in carrying out the goods loading and unloading at each port. Santarém
and Itaqui are examples of ports which operation time is higher than the others sample ports. On the other
hand, Rio Grande and Imbituba are examples of port with relatively more agile operation. According to
ﬁgure 6, undocking time represents the smaller portion of the procedure total time. Santarém in 2012
presented the greater average time to undocking a ship. Nevertheless, in the average for the sample, the
ports take around 2 hours to undock a ship.

According to the information, it is noted that in most of the ports analyzed, the waiting time for
docking is the stage that contributes the most for the total stay time. São Francisco do Sul, for example,

12

0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Time in hours Time to undock Operation Time Waiting time to initiate the operation Waiting time to dock has the highest waiting time for docking of the sample. And throughout the sample years, this stage has
considerable increased. Salvador, Fortaleza and Vitória also presented growth of the waiting time for
docking. Other ports such as Itaqui, Paranaguá, Itajaí, and Suape presented a reduction of the waiting
time for docking, although this stage still consists in a relevant part of the port procedure. Ports such as
Santarém, Vila do Conde, and Belém stand out for not having waiting time for docking. However, these
ports present important shares of waiting time to initiate the operations (red color). Indeed, the sum of
both waiting times is called ineffectiveness time and represents the time in which the ship is prepared to
perform the goods loading and unloading procedure, but stay waiting, or to dock in the port, or to initiate
the operation. Table 2 presents the participation of the waiting time in the total time of stay of each port
over the sample years.

According to the table 2, the less ineffectiveness ports are the ones from Rio de Janeiro, Belém, and
Vila do Conde, in which the waiting time is below 10% of the procedure total time. On the other hand, from
the 16 sample ports, 11 of them present waiting time superior to 40% of total time. Among them, Fortaleza,
Vitória, Itajaí, Santos, Rio Grande, Paranaguá, Salvador, and São Francisco do Sul present percentage
values superior to 50%.
In these ports, in most part of the total time of stay, the ship is inoperative.
Moreover, in many cases, this participation of the waiting time has increased over the sample years. In
fact, the average of this participation of the waiting time has increased for the sample ports. These results
indicate the presence of a bottleneck in the ﬂow of the Brazilian production to the international market.
Because of the growth in Brazilian trade ﬂows over the last decade, those limitations have become even
more evident, and they point out to a need of investments in order to increase the port capacity, reducing
inefﬁciencies that generate those elevated percentages of ineffectiveness time in Brazilian ports.

3.2 Estimated Results

From the discussed empirical strategy, this section presents the estimates of the proposed models using
four basic speciﬁcations to obtain a more precise analysis of the time effects on Brazilian exports. In
this sense, the models were estimated by ﬁxed effects for the pair of municipalities, destination country,
product category and pair of ports used. In order to evaluate the time of port procedure effects over trade,
the ﬁxed effects model is presented as the most appropriate. In fact, the ﬁxed effects model consists in
an appropriate treatment for estimating the gravity equation, since it allows control of the heterogeneity
of countries, and the effect of other unobservable omitted or difﬁcult to measure variables, that are time
invariant (such as the multilateral resistance indexes, 𝑄𝑘
𝑚) in order to eliminate bias resulting from
its omission. In addition to eliminating the need for inclusion of many unobservable characteristics, the

𝑖 and 𝑄𝑘

13

choice of using ﬁxed effects models were conﬁrmed by running Hausman statistics, that corroborate this
option instead of the random effects model. Table 3 presents these estimations.

According to the estimated coefﬁcients, the municipal export coefﬁcient has a positive and statistically
signiﬁcant effect on the exported volume in all estimated speciﬁcations. These results show the importance
of the export capacity in determine the Brazilian exports at the municipal level, which supports the theory
of the gravity model and are similar to results found in the literature of the traditional gravity model.

The average number of dockings variable present a positive and statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcient in
all equations estimated. This result is intuitive and supports the idea that ports that have a higher number
of dockings also have higher volume of trade. On the other hand, the variable that measures the cost of
the port, present negative and statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcients in all equations. This result indicates that
the cost of the port is an important determinant of the trade volumes. Moreover, the results highlight the
importance of the inclusion of these two variables in all equations to control for port characteristics that
may affect the trade volume.

The ﬁrst speciﬁcation shows the effect of the total time of stay on exports for the Brazilian municipali-
ties. In fact, assuming that a reduction in the time of stay affects only the exports of municipalities that use
that port, a reduction of 10% of the total length of stay, or at any stage of the procedure, would generate an
increase of around 5.14% in relative local exports. For a more detailed analysis, the speciﬁcations (2) and
(3) estimate the effects of the time of the port procedure disaggregated by the steps of the port procedure.
In speciﬁcation (2), the operation time and the remaining time of the procedure, that is the total time of
stay excluding the operating time were included on the equation. According to the estimated coefﬁcients,
keeping the time of the other steps constant, a reduction in the relative operation time do not affect the
relative exports, while a reduction of 10% on the time of the remaining process would generate an increase
in exports of 3.53%. These results suggest that the operation step do not matter for the exported volume,
while at least one of the other steps (waiting to dock, waiting to initiate the operations or to undock)
presents a negative and statistically signiﬁcant effect.

14

The speciﬁcation (3) estimates the impact of the length of the procedure disaggregated by the impact of
the ship waiting time for docking and time docked. According to the estimated coefﬁcients, a reduction of
10% in the waiting time to dock is reﬂected in an increase of 1% in relative exports, while the time the ship
remains docked would generate no relevant impact in local exports. This result strength the coefﬁcients
presented on speciﬁcation (2), by highlighting the importance of negative effects on trade volumes from
increasing waiting time. In fact, great part of the docked time is determined by the operation step.

The last speciﬁcation estimates the impact of the participation of the ineffectiveness time in the total
time. Therefore we created a measure of the waiting time as a percentage of the total length of stay.
The objective is to estimate the impact over trade from reductions in the time the ship is inoperative as a
percentage of the total time it takes to complete the whole procedure. The estimated coefﬁcients indicate
that a reduction of 10% in ineffectiveness rate is reﬂected in an increase of 2.66% in exports.

Putting the results in context, the median number of hours of stay in the sample, as shown at table 1
is 25.5. Therefore, each additional hour of a ship’s stay in the median port is equivalent to a reduction of
around 2% (0.514 × 1/25.5) of local exports. More speciﬁcally, each hour delayed in the waiting time to
dock in the median port, keeping all the rest constant, is equivalent to a reduction of 0.88% (0.1× 1/11.4)
in local exports.

Additionally to the estimation of the impact of time of port procedures on the volume of trade, we also
evaluate the effects of time on the number of exported products. At this stage, the goal is to examine how
the time of port procedures can affect the diversiﬁcation of exports from Brazilian municipalities. Table 4
presents the estimation results of the proposed models.

According to this second group of estimations, the export coefﬁcient presents a positive and statistically
signiﬁcant relation to the variety of exports. This result highlights the idea of the theoretical gravity model,
in which regions with higher export capability not only exports a greater volume, but also have a greater
variety of products exported. As the results presented before, the number of dockings present a positive
and statistically signiﬁcant relation to the number of exported products. However, the coefﬁcients of the

15

costs of port usage are not statistically signiﬁcant. This indicates that although the costs may be important
to determining the volume of trade, they do not seem to be relevant to explain the variety of trade.

The time of stay in the port procedures have a negative and statistically signiﬁcant relationship with the
number of exported products. A reduction of 10% in the total time of stay on increase by 1% on the number
of products exported. Regarding the steps of the port procedure, the results indicate that the operation time
is not relevant when the effects on export diversiﬁcation are analyzed. According to speciﬁcation (2) in
table 4, a reduction of 10% in the waiting time to dock, waiting time do initiate the operations or to undock
could increase the number of products exported in 0.71%. The other two speciﬁcations, present negative
coefﬁcients for the time variables, but none of them is statistically signiﬁcant.

In sum, the results suggest that time delays on port procedures represent an important determinant of
the volume of exports and on export diversiﬁcation. Moreover, when we estimate the time effect divided
into the procedures steps, the ineffectiveness or waiting times are the ones which present relevant impacts.

3.3 Sensibility Analysis

This section presents a set of estimations performed to test the sensibility of the results. The following
tables present the estimates of the same speciﬁcations of the ones shown in table 3, but with changes in the
sample. The goal is to verify how the results are modiﬁed as the sample varies in relation to the coverage
of ports and products. The ﬁrst four columns of table 5 presents the estimates only with observations in
which the two ports considered on the ratio are located in the same geographic region. This additional
restriction reduces the number of observations, but also strengthens the hypothesis made to control for
“behind the border” trade facilitation.

The last four columns presents the estimates without the top 20 products (HS-2digits) exported through
the ports included in our sample.16 In Brazil, many sample ports have some products in which its exports
are concentrated. In this sense, the ports can invest more in loading and unloading capacity or even access
to the port of speciﬁc products. By eliminating the main products exported, the estimates of the procedures

of the time of the impact becomes less susceptible to possible endogeneity that may exist between the
exported amount of speciﬁc goods and the time for each step of the port procedure.

In general, the control variables maintain their signals and statistical signiﬁcance. Considering the
time variables, the pattern shown in table 3 maintained, i. e, the time of port procedures continue to
represent an important determiner of trade volume, and the most important steps of the procedure, are those
related to the ineffectiveness. Furthermore, the magnitude of the coefﬁcients of time variables increased in
comparison to those presented in table 3. In fact, according to this new set of estimates, a decrease of 10%
on relative time of stay is reﬂected in an increase between 6.37% and 9.94% on local exports. Reductions
of 10% in the ineffectiveness or in the time to undock are associated with increases between 4.13% and
7.33% on relative exports.

From table 5, the coefﬁcient of waiting time to dock is the one that presented less variation. According
to the results, a reduction of 10% on the time that a ship waits to dock would increase the relative exports
of Brazilian cities between 1.13% and 1.15%. Moreover, when the sample consider the same region
ports only, the time docked becomes statistical signiﬁcant at 10% level. The speciﬁcations (4) and (8)
also presented coefﬁcients for the waiting time rate relatively higher if compared to the results presented
before.

Regarding the models estimated with the ratio of the number of products as the dependent variable,
we performed the same sensibility tests as done before. The ﬁrst four columns of table 6 present the
estimations only with ratios build with ports from a same geographical region. The last four columns
eliminate the main products exported in the period.

According to the results, the coefﬁcients of the control variables maintain the same general pattern, in
terms of signals and statistical signiﬁcance, of the ones presented on table 4. Considering the estimations
with ports from same regions the coefﬁcient of the total time of stay becomes statistically insigniﬁcant.
The only measures that represent relevant impacts to the number of products are the waiting time to initiate
the operations and the time to undock.

On the other hand, considering the estimations without the most traded products, the results are more
close to those presented on table 4. In this case, a 10% reduction on total time of stay would increase the
number of exported goods in around 1%. Moreover, a 10% reduction on the ineffectiveness time or in the
time to undock would increase 0.96% the number of products exported.

From the tests conducted, we can conclude that each additional hour in the port procedures time imply
in negative impacts on Brazilian exports, regardless of the sample analyzed and the restrictions on con-
structed reasons. While it may occur some variation in the magnitude of the coefﬁcients and in the relative
importance of each step, the overall picture that the ineffectiveness steps are the most important, does not
change.

4 Final Remarks

In this study, we built an innovative database with municipal exports data, distinguishing the port used,
country of destination, and with products aggregated at four-digit Harmonized System (HS) for the period
of 2010 to 2012. A gravity equation in differences adapted for disaggregated data was estimated by the
ﬁxed effects estimator.

According to the measures analyzed, the Brazilian ports composing the sample present an average stay
time of 28 hours and 12 minutes. From this total, an average of 15 hours and 42 minutes is spent with
the ship docked, and the rest is wasted in waiting. The ports from the sample present an average time of
inaction (Time waiting for docking and waiting for the beginning of operations) of 45.17%, in 2012. These
results indicate the presence of a bottleneck in the ﬂow of the Brazilian production to the international
market. Because of the growth in Brazilian trade ﬂows in the last decade, these limitations became even
more evident, and point to the necessity of investments that increase the port capacity. Consequently,
reducing the inefﬁciency that generates such high percentages of ineffectiveness time in Brazilian ports.

In general, the results suggest that the reduction in port procedures delays can guarantee to Brazilian
exporters a better access to the international market. In fact, reducing the time of port procedures imply
ultimately in a reduction of exporter costs, ensuring that the product arrives at the destination market with
higher quality and at a lower ﬁnal cost, improving their competitiveness abroad. According to the estimates
made, a reduction of 10% in total time of stay may increase the municipal exports in around 5.1%.

The study also presents empirical evidence that the time in port also affects the variety of products that
a municipality can export. According to the results, a reduction of 10% at the relative time a ship stays in
the port can increase the number of product categories around 1%. This result although more modest than
the estimated coefﬁcients for the trade volume models, is statistically signiﬁcant and lead to the conclusion
that the time spent speciﬁcally in port procedures is also an important determiner of the variety of sectors
involved in international trade.

The results also suggest that the steps of ineffectiveness time are the most important determinants of
trade volume and variety. A reduction of 10% in the waiting time or in the time do undock could increase
the export volume in 3.5%. An equivalent reduction but on the waiting time to dock increase municipal
exports volume in around 1%. However, reductions on the time of operation or on the time docked seem to
have no signiﬁcant impact on the volume of trade. For the time effects over the variety of trade, a reduction
of 10% on the ineffectiveness time or on the time to undock can increase the number of product categories
in around 0.7%.

In a world scenario where tariff barriers has been falling gradually as trade facilitation elements gain
importance in trade negotiations and public policy agendas, this study provides evidence of the high and
statistically signiﬁcant impact of the slowdown in Brazilian ports on the country’s exports. In this sense,
the results suggest that investments in the expansion and modernization of port infrastructure that would
ensure increased access to ports and reducing waiting times for ships, that confer greater speed ports to
carry out the loading and unloading operations would generate signiﬁcant impacts on exports both in the
intensive and extensive margins.
