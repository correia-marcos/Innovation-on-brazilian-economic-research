Resumo 
Este  estudo  apresenta  novas  evidências  sobre  a  relação  entre  desigualdade  e  desenvolvimento  de  longo 
prazo  a  partir  de  dados  de  diferentes  regiões  brasileiras.  Novos  indicadores  de  desigualdade  são 
construídos a partir de dados primários para os municípios brasileiros em 1920 (usamos o Censo de 1920, 
que  não  foi  sistematicamente  utilizado  para  tais  propósitos):  o  índice  de  Gini  da  distribuição  de  terras 
(entre donos de terras e considerando toda a população) e a porcentagem de potenciais eleitores. Primeiro, 
não  encontramos  uma  relação  significativa  entre  a  desigualdade  da  distribuição  de  terras  e  a  relativa 
concentração  política  para  os  municípios  considerados  no  início  do  século  XX.  Segundo,  encontramos, 
através  de  exercícios  econométricos,  relações  entre  desigualdade  e  desenvolvimento  no  longo-prazo 
particulares  para  cada  conjunto  de  observações:  (i)  uma  relação  positiva  entre  desigualdade  da 
distribuição de terras e desenvolvimento para os estados da região Sudeste, São Paulo e Minas Gerais; (ii) 
uma  ausência  de  relação  significativa  entre  os  indicadores  de  desigualdade  no  início  do  século  XX  e 
desenvolvimento  contemporâneo  para  o  estado  de  Pernambuco;  e  (iii)  uma  relação  negativa  entre 
desigualdade  e  desenvolvimento  para  o  Rio  Grande  do  Sul.  Terceiro,  não  encontramos  uma  relação 
estatisticamente  robusta  entre  nosso  indicador  de  concentração  política  e  desenvolvimento  no  longo-
prazo.  O  que  seria  um  resultado  possivelmente  contra-intuitivo  à  luz  da  literatura  internacional,  é 
provavelmente consistente com um sistema político capturado e níveis bastante baixos de acesso ao voto. 
Os  resultados  acima  são  mantidos  mesmo  após  controlarmos  para  proxies  de  mudanças  estruturais 
ocorridas  no  período,  entre  elas:  urbanização,  industrialização  e  imigração.  Além  desses  resultados, 
apresentamos evidência de que a desigualdade da distribuição da terra em 1920 é, no máximo, fracamente 
relacionada à desigualdade contemporânea para Minas Gerais e São Paulo, enquanto é significante para o 
Rio  Grande  do  Sul  e  Pernambuco.  Estes  resultados  ressaltam  a  importância  do  estudo  de  elementos 
históricos  no  seu  respectivo  contexto,  uma  vez  que  são  consistentes com  um  Brasil  rural  dominado  por 
elites agrárias em um complexo ambiente institucional.

Abstract 
In  this  paper,  we  present  evidence  on  the  relationship  between  inequality  and  long-term  development 
using  data  on  different  Brazilian  regions.  New  inequality  indicators  are  constructed  from  scratch  for 
Brazilian municipalities in 1920 (using the Census of 1920, which, surprisingly, had thus far been ignored 
for  such  purposes).  We  find  no  significant  relationship  between  economic  (land) inequality  (proxied  by 
the  Land  Gini)  and  political  concentration  (proxied  by  the  percentage  of  eligible  voters)  for  Brazilian 
municipalities in the early twentieth century. Econometric analysis indicates a positive robust relationship 
between  economic  inequality  and  long-term  development  indicators  for  Southeastern  states:  São  Paulo 
and Minas Gerais; we find no relationship for Pernambuco; and a positive and robust relationship for Rio 
Grande do Sul. We found no evidence of a robust relationship between the percentage of eligible voters 
and long-term development, a surprising result in light of the results provided in development literature, 
but  likely  consistent  with  a  politically  captured  system  with  very  low  levels  of  enfranchisement.  These 
results are shown to hold even when controlling for proxies for structural changes that happened in this 
time span, namely: urbanization, industrialization, and immigration. Moreover, land inequality in 1920 is 
at  most  weakly  related  to  contemporaneous  income  inequality  for  Minas  Gerais  and  São  Paulo,  but 
significant for Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Sul. These results highlight the importance of the study of 
historical and social elements in their respective context, as the results are consistent with the picture of a 
rural Brazil dominated by agrarian elites within a complex institutional environment.

Introduction 

Undoubtedly  inequality  is  one  of  the  main  issues  in  today’s  world.  It  is  a  subject  of  intrinsic 
interest, in the sense that it is related to moral concepts such as justice and fairness. It is also interesting 
for its effects, for example, on the growth and on the educational attainments of a society. Ironically, it is 
one of the most hotly-debated subjects within growth and development economic literature and one which 
is far from reaching a consensus. 

A first wave of development literature (as characterized by Easterly 2007) presents the idea that 
high inequality could promote growth by concentrating income into the hands of high-saving capitalists 
(Kuznets 1955; Kaldor 1956). As presented in Aghion, Caroli, and García-Peñalosa (1999), the view that 
wealth  inequality  could  be  growth-enhancing  is  based  on  two  different  arguments:  (i)  investment 
indivisibilities;  and  (ii)  the  tradeoff  between  productive  efficiency  and  equality.  Later  works  indicate  a 
possible  negative  effect  of  economic  inequality  on  growth,  both  theoretically  and  empirically.  Several 
mechanisms were suggested as causes of this, such as political economy mechanisms (Alesina and Rodrik 
1994;  Persson  and  Tabellini  1994),  imperfect  capital  markets  (Banerjee  and  Newman  1991;  Galor  and 
Zeira 1993) and investment in human capital (Bourguignon and Verdier 2000; Galor, Moav, and Vollrath 
2009;  Galor  and  Zeira  1993),  and  the  composition  of  the  aggregate  demand  (Murphy,  Shleifer,  and 
Vishny 1989). 

Three important studies followed, casting doubt on the robustness of what  were then considered 
consistent  results,  and  finding  a  negative  relationship  between  economic  inequality  and  growth.  Using 
new data and panel techniques, Forbes (2000) finds a positive relationship between economic inequality 
and growth. Barro (2000) and Banerjee and Duflo (2003) also present evidence against such a clear-cut 
negative  relationship.  Finally,  Easterly  (2007)  using  an  insightful  instrument,  finds  again  a  negative 
relationship between inequality and economic performance. 

There  are  also  important  studies  correlating  political  inequality  and  development.  Acemoglu 
(2008)  shows  how  political  inequality  may  retard  development  due  to  the  unwillingness  of  incumbent 
elites  to  allow  the  entry  of  new  agents.  Elites  might  also  block  the  introduction  of  new  technologies 
(Acemoglu  and  Robinson  2000).  Bates  (1981)  shows  how,  in  a  politically  concentrated  environment, 
there  might  be  little  interest  in  the  provision  of  public  goods,  including  schooling.  As  also  noted  by 
Acemoglu et al. (2008), political inequality will also tend to be associated with the absence of political 
competition and accountability, two factors that help to guarantee that political systems generate desirable 
outcomes. 

Even more important for the present work are  Engerman and Sokoloff’s comprehensive series of 
insightful studies on the development of the Americas. Engerman and Sokoloff (1997; 2002) argued that 
factor  endowments  had  a  major  influence  on  the  colonization  strategies  throughout  the  American 
continent  that,  in  turn,  established  different  initial  levels  of  inequality  that  account  for  the  divergent 
institutional  paths  of  American  societies that  resulted  in the  differential  development  standards  of these 
regions  today.  Therefore,  in  Engerman  and  Sokoloff’s  view,  inequality  had  prejudicial  effects  on 
development in a cross-country framework. 

It  is  in  this  context  of  apparently  contradictory  evidence  that  Acemoglu  et  al.’s  (2008)  study 
belongs.  Their  study  is  the  first  to  distinguish  empirically  between  economic  and  political  inequality  in 
their  exploration  of  the  effects  of  inequality.  As  the  authors  correctly  note,  economic  inequality  is 
probably  endogenous  in  regressions  without  a  political  inequality  variable,  since  we  expect  them  to  be 
linked, and this might bias the econometric evidence on the effects of economic inequality. The authors 
not  only  construct  different  variables  for economic  inequality  (the  land  Gini)  and political  inequality  (a 
political  concentration  index)  but  also  deal  with  a  constant  de  jure  environment,  the  region  of 
Cundinamarca in Colombia, which, according to Pande and Udry (2005) might provide deeper insights on 
the specific channels through which inequality affects development. 

The  authors  present  surprising  evidence.  Overall,  they  find  a  negative  relationship  between 
economic  and  political  inequality  for  nineteenth-century  Colombia  and  a  positive  association  between 
economic  inequality  in  the  nineteenth  century  and  development  outcomes  in  the  late  twentieth  century. 
These results are unexpected, as it is generally expected for Latin America to have high inequality, both 
economic  and  political,  and  that  they  are  positively  correlated  (mutually  reinforcing  each  other).  The 
interpretation  of  the  authors,  based  on  Bates’  (1981)  insights  on  Africa,  is  that  in  “weakly 
institutionalized”  societies,  where  few  constraints  were  imposed  on  the  actions  politicians  could  take, 
large landowners had the power to keep in check the rapacious tendencies of these politicians.2 

We provide a similar analysis for the complex case of Brazil. With unique data from the beginning 
of the twentieth-century – the Brazilian Economic and Demographic Census of 1920  – we were able to 
construct  from  scratch  unique  indicators  of  economic  inequality  (the  land  Gini  coefficient  among 
landowners) and of political inequality (the proportion of individuals that were eligible to vote) for each 
municipality  in  selected  Brazilian  states.  We  not  only  analyze  how  inequality  (both  economic  and 
political) is related to long-term development, we also go further into analyzing how inequality is related 
to long-term development allowing for different de facto institutional environments and controlling for a 
constant de jure context (in line with Pande and Udry’s reorientation argument). 

Therefore, we are able to present in a new framework both the inequality literature and the recent 
institutional  literature  (Acemoglu,  Johnson,  and  Robinson  2001;  2002;  Pande  and  Udry  2005;  Banerjee 
and  Iyer  2005).  We  calculate  the  respective  inequality  indicators  for  all  the  municipalities  in  four 
Brazilian states: Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, São Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul. The states were carefully 
selected  in  order  to  capture  how  inequality  is  related  to  long-term  development  in  different  de  facto 
institutional environments greatly influenced by the unique colonial experiences of these regions. 

The  evidence is  surprising.  First,  in  all  samples,  we  find  almost  no correlation  between  the  land 
Gini and the percentage of eligible voters in Brazilian municipalities in 1920. Second, and also somewhat 
surprisingly, we find a positive relationship between economic inequality in the early part of the twentieth 
century  and  contemporaneous  development  outcomes,  for  the  sample  as  a  whole,  and  for  the  states  of 
Minas Gerais and São Paulo, both from the Southeast region. Pernambuco, a Northeastern state, presents 
no evidence of a relationship between economic inequality and long-term development outcomes, while 
the evidence for the South, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, is that this relationship is negative. Third, we 
find  only  a  tenuous  relationship  between  political  inequality  (measured  as  the  percentage  of  eligible 
voters) and long-term development outcomes. This is an interesting result, for it appears to contradict the 
general  view  that  greater  political  participation  would  foster  development.  Moreover,  in  states  where 
there  is  a  positive  relationship  between  economic  inequality  and  long-term  development  (Minas  Gerais 
and  São  Paulo),  we  find  no  evidence  of  a  correlation  between  economic  (land)  inequality  in  early 
twentieth century Brazil and contemporaneous income inequality. 

This study not only presents new evidence on the relationship between inequality and long-term 
development within Latin America, it also provides a new strategy for exploring the interaction between 
inequality in general and the institutional structure of a society. 

 

The Census of 1920 

The Data 

The Census of 1920 is the fourth population census and the first agricultural and industrial census 
to  have  been  conducted  in  Brazil.  In  accordance  with the  International  Statistical Congress,  which  took 
place  in  Belgium  in  1853,  the  purpose  of  an  agricultural  census  is  to  “indicate  the  facts  in  which  the 
complete knowledge of the conditions, process, and results of the agrarian statistics of each country at a 
specific  time,  depends”  (IBGE,  1923,  p.  v).  Therefore,  it  is  the  first  reliable  survey  of  the  agrarian 
conditions throughout the nation. 

The  Census  contains  detailed information  on  the  quantity  and  average  size  of  rural  properties  at 
the  municipality  level,  which  enables  us  to  construct  our  measures  of  land  inequality,  which  we  use  as 
proxy  for  economic  inequality,  for  each  of  the  four  states  of  interest:  Minas  Gerais,  Pernambuco,  São 

                                                 
2 The concept of “weakly institutionalized” is developed in Acemoglu, Robinson, and Verdier (2004). 

Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul.3 The average territorial extension of the rural properties is divided into the 
following measurements: (i) less than 41 hectares; (ii) 41 to 100 hectares; (iii) 101 to 200 hectares; (iv) 
201 to 400 hectares; (v) 401 to 1,000 hectares; (vi) 1,001 to 2,000 hectares; (vii) 2,001 to 5,000 hectares; 
(viii) 5,001 to 10,000 hectares; (ix) 10,001 to 25,000 hectares; and (x) 25,001 hectares or more. We have 
data on 115,655 rural properties in the 178 municipalities of Minas Gerais, 23,336 rural properties in the 
59  municipalities  of  Pernambuco,  80,921  rural  properties  in  the  204  municipalities  of  São  Paulo,  and 
124,990 rural properties in the 71 municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul. 

The  number  of  rural  properties  surveyed  throughout  the  country  is  648,153,  with  a  total area  of 
175,104,675  hectares  (Table  1),  which  corresponds  to  20.6  percent  of  the  country’s  entire  area. 
Specifically, 65.1 percent of the area of the state of Rio Grande Sul, 56.2 percent of the area of the state of 
São  Paulo,  52  percent  of  the  state  of  Pernambuco,  and  46.1  percent  of  the  state  of  Minas  Gerais,  were 
surveyed rural properties (IBGE, 1923, p. xi). 

Table 1 gives us an indication of the concentration of land distribution in Brazil. Nearly half (49 
percent)  of  the  properties  surveyed  are  smaller  than  41  hectares.  However,  these  rural  properties 
constitute  only  3.5  percent  of  the  surveyed  area.  The  largest  share  of  the  surveyed  area  consists  of 
properties  between  2,001  and  5,000  hectares  (16.4  percent).  Impressively,  properties  larger  than  25,000 
hectares  correspond  to  15.6  percent  of  the  surveyed  area  (more  than  the  area  occupied  by  properties 
smaller than 200 hectares, which is 14.9 percent). 

The  Census  also  provides  a  broad  set  of  demographic  and  geographic  data  for  a  total  of  1304 
Brazilian municipalities in 1920. As we can see from Table  2, the number of municipalities was 178 for 
Minas Gerais, 59 for Pernambuco, 204 for São Paulo, and 71 for Rio Grande do Sul. The largest state is 
Minas Gerais, with an area of 59,381,000 hectares, followed by Rio Grande do Sul (28,528,900 hectares) 
and  São  Paulo  (24,723,900),  and  finally,  the  smallest  state,  Pernambuco,  with  an  area  of  9,925,400 
hectares. 

As  expected  due  to  its  large  area  and  economic  importance,  Minas  Gerais  is  the  most  populous 
state,  with  a  population  of  5,888,174  inhabitants.  The  second  most  populous  state  is  São  Paulo 
(population: 4,592,188), followed by Rio Grande do Sul (population: 2,182,713), and finally Pernambuco 
(population:  2,154,835).  However,  Pernambuco  has  the  highest  population  density:  0.22  persons  per 
hectare.  Figures  for  São  Paulo,  Minas  Gerais,  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  are  0.19,  0.10,  and  0.08, 
respectively (Table 2). 

Table  2  also  presents  figures  on  the  number  of  foreigners  and  occupational  shares.  Consistently 
with  the  recent  inflow  of  migrants,  foreigners  represent  18.1  percent  of  the  population  of  São  Paulo. 
Figures for Minas Gerais and Pernambuco are much lower: 1.5 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively. Rio 
Grande do Sul, in between São Paulo and Minas Gerais and Pernambuco, has 6.9 percent of its population 
composed  by  foreigners.  Agricultural  activities  are  the  main  occupation  for  the  four  considered  states. 
The percentage of individuals working on these activities ranges from 16.9 percent in Rio Grande do Sul 
to  21.4  percent  in  Pernambuco.  Figures  for  Minas  Gerais  and  São  Paulo  are  21.0  percent  and  18.3 
percent, respectively. Industrial activities include a much lower share of the population. Minas Gerais has 
the  lowest  share  of  population  working  in  such  activities:  2.5  percent.  As  expected,  São  Paulo  has  the 
highest share of population working in industrial activities: 5.0 percent. Figures for Pernambuco and Rio 
Grande do Sul are: 3.3 percent and 3.9 percent. Less than 1.0 percent of the respective populations work 
in “liberal professions”. 

Considering the large and detailed data set provided by the census, we note with curiosity the lack 
of studies using that data to determine levels of inequality. One possible reason is that the information has 
not  yet been digitized, which makes data collection very onerous.  For this study,  both data compilation 
and  elaboration  of  the  indexes  have  been  done  from  scratch  and  have  resulted  in  what  are,  to  our 
knowledge, unique for the municipal level in Brazil for 1920. 
 
Land Distribution and Political Concentration 

                                                 
3 For some  variables there are data available on the  county  level as well (and, obviously, on  more aggregate  levels,  such as 
states). Our interest is on the municipality level. 

Land has been very unequally distributed in Brazil since colonial times. Brazil’s agrarian structure 
has  been  largely  characterized  by  large  landholdings.  Figures  from  the  Census  of  1920  show  that  71.5 
percent  of  the  rural  properties  surveyed  were  smaller  than  101  hectares,  while  only  4.1  percent  were 
bigger than 1,000 hectares. However, these same 71.5 percent of rural properties corresponded to only 9 
percent of the total area surveyed, while the 4.1 percent corresponded to 63.4 percent of the total area. Of 
the  648,153  rural  properties  surveyed,  only  461  (0.1  percent)  were  larger  than  25,000  hectares,  which 
nevertheless corresponded to 15.6 percent of the total area surveyed (a higher proportion than the 535,256 
properties smaller than 201 hectares, 14.9  percent). However, the larger the landholdings, the lower the 
unit value of land (IBGE, 1923, p. xii). 

Table 3 presents the figures broken down by state, revealing several important features. First, Rio 
Grande do Sul, with 124,990 rural properties, is the state with the highest number of properties surveyed. 
Minas  Gerais  follows  with  115,655  rural  properties  while  São  Paulo  and  Pernambuco  had  80,921  and 
23,336 rural properties, respectively. However, the total area of the properties surveyed is larger in Minas 
Gerais (27,393,210 hectares) than in Rio Grande do Sul (18,589,996 hectares). This is consistent with our 
second feature: while all states present a similar pattern to the country as a whole by presenting a higher 
concentration  of  rural  properties  smaller  than  101  hectares,  there  are  important  variations  within  this 
pattern.  Whereas  only  26.5  percent  of  the  rural  properties  in  Pernambuco  are  smaller  than  41  hectares 
(with 48.1 percent smaller than 101 hectares), a total of 61.7 percent of the rural properties in Rio Grande 
do  Sul  are  smaller  than  41  hectares  (with  83.6  percent  smaller  than  101  hectares).  The  figures  for  São 
Paulo and Minas Gerais are 48.4 percent (with 73.7 percent smaller than 101 hectares) and 32.3 percent 
(with  60.5  percent  smaller  than  101  hectares),  respectively.  Third,  of  the  total  area  surveyed,  rural 
properties  smaller  than  101  hectares  represent  only  9.2  percent  for  Pernambuco  (with  2.8  percent  of 
properties  smaller  than  41  hectares)  and  11.1  percent  for  Minas  Gerais  (with  2.9  percent  of  properties 
smaller  than  41  hectares).  However,  properties  smaller  than  101  hectares  make  up  17.9  percent  of  the 
surveyed area for Rio Grande do Sul and 15.2 percent for São Paulo. 

Another important aspect of the agrarian structure of the four states is that the largest share of the 
surveyed  area  is  composed  of  properties between  401 and  1,000  hectares:  Minas  Gerais  (20.1  percent), 
Pernambuco  (30.1  percent),  and  São  Paulo  (18.2  percent).  However,  for  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  properties 
between  2,001  and  5,000  hectares  occupy  the  largest  area  (19.8  percent).  Finally,  we  highlight  the 
impressive  share  of  properties  bigger  than  25,000  hectares  in  São  Paulo  and  Minas  Gerais:  7.4  percent 
and 6.7 percent, respectively. 

With  the  available  information,  we  were  able  to  construct  two  types  of  measures  of  economic 
inequality.  The  first  one  is  the  standard  land  Gini  coefficient,  which  measures  land  inequality  among 
landowners.  For each municipality we constructed the Gini coefficient using the same formula as Nunn 
(2008):4 

1 +  1

𝑛    −

2    𝑛 − 𝑖 + 1 𝑎𝑖

𝑛
𝑖=1

 

𝑛   𝑎𝑖

𝑛
𝑖=1

where  𝑛  is  the  number  of  rural  properties,  𝑎𝑖  is  the  farm  size,  and  𝑖  denotes  the  rank,  where  rural 
properties are ranked in ascending order of 𝑎𝑖. 

The average land Gini considering all the comparable territorial units (CTU) from the four states 
was 0.61. The average coefficient was 0.60 for Minas Gerais, 0.44 for Pernambuco, 0.65 for São Paulo, 
and also 0.65 for Rio Grande do Sul (Table 4). 

Although widely used, the standard land Gini does not capture one important aspect of economic 
inequality: it does not take into account individuals who do not own land. If, for example, land is divided 
equally amongst 10% of the individuals of a given society, while the other 90% remain without land, the 
standard land Gini coefficient will indicate that this society is an egalitarian one. Therefore, if we want a 
proxy  for  economic  inequality  for  the  population  as  a  whole,  we  need  an  overall  land  Gini.  We 
constructed our overall land Gini for the municipalities in 1920 using the same formula as Acemoglu  et 
al.  (2008)  and  Summerhill  (2010),  by  computing  equation  (1)  assigning  zero  land  holdings  to  the 

                                                 
4 The calculation is made using the Stata program ineqdec and ineqdec0. 

estimated  number  of  families that  do  not  have  land  holdings.5  The  average  overall  land  Gini  for  all  the 
CTU  considered  in  this  study,  is  0.87.  The  average  overall  land  Gini  coefficients  are  0.87  for  Minas 
Gerais and Pernambuco, 0.88 for São Paulo, and 0.76 for Rio Grande do Sul (Table 4). 

The Census of 1920 also allows the construction of our proxy for political inequality in the early 

twentieth century: the percentage of individuals eligible to vote. 

According  to  the  Constitution  of  1891,  only  literate  Brazilian  men  21 and  older were  eligible to 
vote.6 Therefore, using the data on population and literacy for the municipalities, we can easily calculate 
the  percentage  of  the  population  of  each municipality  which  was  eligible  to  vote  in  1920.  The  average 
percentage of individuals eligible to vote considering all the CTU of our study is 7.4 percent. In 1920, 8.2 
percent of the population was eligible to vote in Minas Gerais, 5.4 percent in Pernambuco, 6.8 percent in 
São Paulo, and 10.3 percent in Rio Grande do Sul (Table 4). We see that Rio Grande do Sul appears to be 
more equal not only in an economic sense (overall land Gini coefficient), but in a political sense as well. 
Moreover,  we  see  a  higher  level  of  political  inequality  in  Pernambuco,  where  a  high  percentage  of  the 
population   was illiterate at the beginning of the twentieth century. 

We  have  also  constructed,  as  robustness  checks,  two  other  variables  for  political  inequality:  the 
percentage  of  individuals  eligible  to  vote  considering  only  the  male  population  and  the  percentage  of 
individuals eligible to vote considering only the literate male population. 

 

Quantitative Analysis 

Inequality and Long-Term Development 

In  order  to  explore  the  long-term  consequences  for  development  in  Brazil  of  land  (economic) 
inequality and political inequality, we exploit the cross-sectional variation in the CTU for our four states 
of interest: Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, São Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul. 

Following Acemoglu et al. (2008), we first estimate cross-sectional ordinary least squares (OLS) 

regressions of the following form: 
2000 = 𝛼𝑔𝑖

where  𝑦𝑖
1920, the (standard) 
covariates, and 𝜀𝑖 is an error term. The key variables in this equation are 𝑔𝑖
land  Gini  coefficient  for  the  CTU  𝑖  in  1920  and  the  constructed  variable  for  political  inequality 
(percentage of eligible voters) for the same  CTU 𝑖 in 1920, respectively.  Therefore, our main interest is 
the consistent estimation of 𝛼 and 𝛽. 

1920 and 𝑝𝑖

The regressions will be estimated for five different samples. First, we will estimate  the regression 
using  all  available  CTU.  Afterwards  we  will  estimate  this  regression  for  each  of  the  four  states 
individually.  We will therefore be able to capture possible different  de facto institutional environments, 
with such differences rooted in the specific colonial experience of each state. As dependent variables, we 
will first use what we have been calling “main outcome variables”, which are the (natural logarithm of) 
GDP per capita, the (natural logarithm of) average years of schooling, and infant mortality. These are the 
three aspects of development needed to construct the HDI, income, education, and health attainments. 

As previously discussed (see Chapter 2), the inclusion of these specific states has a clear purpose. 
Each  of  these  regions  is  representative  of  a  particular  colonial  experience  within  a  constant  de  jure 
environment. This likely led to different de facto institutional environments that might cause inequality to 
relate  in  heterogeneous  ways  with  each  development  indicator.  Pernambuco  is  representative  of  an  old 
agrarian structure, of great importance during the colonial era due to the sugar production that, as stated 
before  (see  Section  X),  had  far-reaching  implications  for  the  political,  economic  and  social  structure  of 
the  region.  Minas  Gerais  was  the  center  of  the  gold  cycle  and  later  became  an  important  producer  of 
coffee  and  a  center  for  the  supply  of  goods  for  the  domestic  market.  São  Paulo  was  the  main  coffee 
producer, and in the late nineteenth century became Brazil’s most important economic center, a position 

                                                 
5 Acemoglu et al. (2008) use an estimate of 10  members per  family, while Summerhill (2010) constructs his coefficients by 
assuming  5  members  per  family.  We  constructed  the  overall  land  Gini  with  the  assumption  of  7,  10,  and  15  members  per 
family. Our main variable is the one using an estimate of 15 individuals per family because it supposedly includes relatives and 
other aggregates living in the same property, an important element in early twentieth-century Brazil.

that  it  still  occupies  today.  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  had  a  later  occupation  with  characteristics  associated  to 
those  of  North  America  (see,  e.g.,  Engerman  and  Sokoloff  1997;  2002),  and  vast  numbers  of  European 
immigrants (as in São Paulo) shaping its development path. 

The main econometric concern with this  specification is the possible endogeneity  bias generated 
by  omitted  variables.7  In  other  words,  if  omitted  factors  in  𝜀𝑖  are  correlated  with  the  explanatory 
variables,  the  estimation  by  OLS  will  generate  inconsistent  estimators.  Easterly  (2007),  based  on  the 
extensive  economic  history  developed  by  Engerman  and  Sokoloff  (see  Section  X),  has  argued  that 
growing conditions (topography, climate, and soil) favorable to the production of cash crops contribute to 
higher inequality. Therefore, we will control for a rich set of covariates (included in the vector 𝒙𝑖). 

Contemporary Outcomes 

 

Table 5 presents the econometric results with geographical and econometrics results. 
In summary, the first robust results linking inequality and long-term development within Brazilian 
regions (Table X) provide evidence of a positive relationship between economic inequality and GDP  per 
capita and average years of schooling. These general results hide a very interesting heterogeneity between 
states which, as already mentioned, had unique colonization experiences. 

Overall Land Gini 
 

Table 6 presents the econometric result including the overall land Gini. 
Therefore,  our  empirical  results  suggest  that  the  effects  of  land  inequality  among  landowners 

would dominate over the effects of the inequality of land distribution across the population as a whole.

Table 7 presents the econometric results with the contemporary Gini  coefficient as the dependent 

Therefore,  there  is  a  positive  relationship  between  economic  inequality  at  the  beginning  of  the 
twentieth  century  and  economic  inequality  in  2000  precisely  in  those  states  where  we  do  not  find  a 
statistically significant positive relationship between economic inequality in 1920 and development in the 
long  run.  In  other  words,  where  economic  inequality  is  not  “structural”,  there  is  a  positive  relationship 
between inequality in land distribution and long-term development 

 

De facto Institutional Environments, Structural Change and Further Results 

Tables 8 and 9 present the results with the econometric results. 
Thus,  we  have  presented  a  robustness  check  for  our  hypothesis  that  the  heterogeneous 
relationships  between  economic  (land)  inequality  within  Brazil  are  due  to  the  different  de  facto 
institutional environments. Several regression specifications show that controlling for variables proxying 
structural changes nonetheless maintains the heterogeneous results within the country. This evidence is in 
accordance with the hypothesis. 

Finally,  two  additional  investigations  are  conducted.  First,  immigration  is  another  structural 
change  that  might  be  related  to  the  effects  of  inequality  on  long-term  development.  We  have  collected 
data on the number of foreigners and included it in our regressions (as a percentage of the population). 
Three  results  are  noteworthy:  (i)  the  inclusion  of  the  new  variable  does  not  alter  any  of  the  results 

                                                 
7 The key condition for OLS consistency is the absence of correlation between the independent variables and the error term. A 
sufficient condition  is the zero conditional  mean  assumption:  𝐸 𝜀/𝒙  = 0, which  means that the error term  is  not correlated 
with any function of the independent variables. In applied econometrics, endogeneity arises in one of three ways: (i) omitted  
variable bias; (ii) measurement error; and (iii) simultaneity (Wooldridge 2010). Our main concern is the omitted variable bias 
due to the inability to control directly for variables such as land quality. The usual formula for analyzing the omitted variable 
bias  is:  𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝛽 
  (Wooldridge 2010, p. 67). Our strategy  in this study  is to use a proxy variable solution. 

𝑘 = 𝛽𝑘 + 𝛾  𝑐𝑜𝑣  𝑥𝑘,𝑞 
𝑣𝑎𝑟  𝑥𝑘 

There are two formal requirements for a proxy variable for the omitted variable q: (i) the proxy variable should be redundant in 
the  structural  equation:  𝐸 𝑦|𝑥, 𝑞, 𝑧  = 𝐸(𝑦|𝑥, 𝑞),  where  z  is  the  proxy  variable;  and  (ii)  the  correlation  between  the  omitted 
variable q and each xj be zero once we partial out z: 𝐿 𝑞 1, 𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑘, 𝑧  = 𝐿(𝑞|1, 𝑧), where 𝐿(. ) represents a linear projection 
(Wooldridge 2010). 

discussed  in  Section  4.2;  (ii)  the  immigrant  variable  is  insignificant  or  of  very  small  magnitude  when 
included  in  regressions  including  the  land  Gini  and  the  percentage  of  eligible  voters  as  independent 
variables and an indicator of development as a dependent variable; and (iii) the immigrant variable is not 
significant  even  when  we  control  for  the  control  variables  included  in  Tables  X  and  X.  Appendix  5 
presents the regression results. 

Second,  quantile  regressions  suggest  that,  except  for  the  state  of  Pernambuco,  the  already 
mentioned  results  are  concentrated  in  CTU  with  relative  small  values  for  the  dependent  variable,  i.e., 
CTU  relatively  less  developed  have  stronger  relations  between  inequality  in  the  1920  and  development 
indicators in 2000. Appendix 6 presents the estimations for the quantile regressions. 

 

Conclusion 

This  study  aimed  to  investigate  the  historical  consequences  of  inequality  and  the  role  of 
institutions.  By  focusing  on  the  Brazilian  case,  we  provided  evidence  of  the  relative  and  potentially 
distinct  roles  of  economic  and  political  inequality  on  long-run  development.  We  believe  that  analyzing 
the effects of economic and political inequality is a necessary step to improve our understanding of the 
causes of underdevelopment in Latin America. 

Our  first  contribution  was  to  construct  from  scratch  both  economic  inequality  variables  (the 
standard  land  Gini  and  the  overall  land Gini)  and  a  proxy  for  political  concentration  (the  percentage  of 
eligible  voters)  variables  at  the  municipal  level  for the  states  of  Minas  Gerais,  Pernambuco,  São  Paulo, 
and Rio Grande do Sul. The states were specifically chosen for the fact that they  had different colonial 
experiences, which probably shaped their de facto institutional environment. Our selection was made on 
the  basis  of  the  abundant  data  provided  by  the  1920  Census,  a  source  which,  surprisingly,  had  not  yet 
been exploited for this purpose. 

Second, our analysis was set in a new framework. We not only explored the relationship between 
economic  and  political 
twentieth-century  with 
contemporaneous  development  outcomes  for  all  comparable  territorial  units,  we  also  explored  these 
relationships  within  each  of  the  selected  states.  This  strategy,  made  possible  due  to  the  rich  variety  of 
colonial experiences within the Brazilian territory, allowed us to account for possibly different  de facto 
institutional environments rooted in the unique respective colonial experience of each state.

The  results  are  surprising.  First,  we  find  almost  no  correlation  between  the  land  Gini  and  the 
percentage  of  eligible  voters  in  Brazilian  municipalities  in  1920.  Second,  and  somewhat  surprising,  we 
find a positive relationship between economic inequality in early twentieth century and contemporaneous 
development outcomes when using the whole sample, and for the states of Minas Gerais and São Paulo, 
both from the Southeast region. Pernambuco, a Northeastern state, presents no evidence of a relationship 
between economic inequality and long-term development outcomes, while the evidence for the South, the 
state  of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  is  that  this  relationship  is  negative.  Third,  we  find  no  robust  significant 
relationship  between  political  inequality,  measured  as  the  percentage  of  eligible  voters,  and  long-term 
development outcomes. Fourth, the effects of economic inequality are largely due to the concentration of 
land among landowners, as shown by the insignificance of the overall land Gini. 

These  are  interesting  results,  for  they  appear  to  contradict  the  general  view  that  economic 
inequality would be costly for a society and that greater political participation would foster development. 
The answer to this riddle might lie in the fact that political participation was very low in early twentieth-
century  Brazil,  and  a  marginal  increase  (the  econometrically  captured  effect)  might  have  given  more 
irrelevant votes to a captured political system, leaving the economic outcomes unchanged. In other words, 
greater  franchise  might  not  have  given  the  population  more  political  participation.  With  regards  to  the 
effects of economic inequality, when considering the land Gini in an agrarian structure, these are likely to 
be strongly linked to collective action problems. In a captured political system such as Brazil in the Old 
Republic,  land  concentration  might  have  differing  effects,  especially  when  taking  into  account  that,  in 
some  regions,  landowners  were  largely  responsible  for  the  provision  of  public  goods.  As  thoughtfully 
stated by Dell (2010): 

In existing theories about land inequality and long-run growth, the implicit counterfactual to large landowners in Latin 
America  is  secure,  enfranchised  smallholders  (ENGERMAN;  SOKOLOFF,  1997;  2002).  This  is  not  an  appropriate 
counterfactual for Peru, or many other places in Latin America, because institutional structures largely in place before 

the formation of the landed elite did not provide secure property rights, protection from exploitation, or a host of other 
guarantees to potential smallholders (Dell 2010, p. 1899). 
Further  important  analyses  were  conducted.  First,  we  find  evidence  that  there  is  almost  no 
correlation  between  economic  (land)  inequality  in  the  early  twentieth  century  and  contemporaneous 
income inequality in states where there is a positive relationship between  economic inequality and long-
term  development  (Minas  Gerais  and  São  Paulo).  In  other  words,  the  positive  effects  of  inequality  are 
associated  with  a  particular  structural  organization  at  a  specific  time,  in  contrast  to  a  more  structural 
inequality, which, as exemplified by the cases of Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Sul, would have either 
negative or no significant effects on long-term development. 

Finally,  our  hypothesis,  that  different  de  facto  institutional  environments  are  associated  with 
different  relationships  between  inequality  and  long-term  developed  was,  initially,  only  implicit  in  our 
analysis.  Important  structural  changes  that  occurred  during  this  time  span  might  be  responsible  for  the 
heterogeneous  relationships  found  previously  between  inequality  and  long-term  development.  Three 
elements  were  our  main  concern:    (i)  industrialization;  (ii)  urbanization;  and  (iii)  immigration.  After 
controlling these elements, our main results were maintained, strengthening our hypothesis. Interestingly, 
we also found no significant effect of immigration on long-term development, even when controlling for 
other structural factors such as industrialization. 

It  is  important  to  note  that  we  do  not  argue  that  inequality  is  conducive  to  development.  We 
present evidence that inequality might be associated with better development outcomes in the long run in 
a  particular  political  context  in a  within country  framework.  It  is  possible  that the  theoretically  harmful 
effects  of  inequality  are  better  reflected  in  a  cross-country  framework,  in  which  the  mechanisms  are 
related  to  the  de  jure  institutional  environment.  In  other  words,  relative  equality  would  be  better  for  a 
particular  country,  but  within  an  unequal  country  (with  certain  socio-political  and  economic 
characteristics) more inequality would be associated with better outcomes.8 

Much work remains to be done. We mention some possible extensions. First, there are few works 
that attempt to control for different  de facto institutional environments. This strategy likely will provide 
beneficial insights in order to better understand the development paths of societies. Second, empirical and 
theoretical  studies  that  offer  a  differentiation  between  within-country  and  cross-country  effects  of 
variables  are  largely  welcome.9  Third,  models  attempting  to  capture  the  within-country  effects  of 
variables such as inequality in politically captured environments are lacking. Finally, the external validity 
of our results remains questionable. Comparative studies within Latin America are a logical next step. 

As  usual,  when  exploring  such  important  issues,  it  is  only  possible  to  make  a  very  modest 
contribution to the small pool of knowledge, compared to the vast oceans of the unknown. Much exciting 
and necessary work lies ahead.
