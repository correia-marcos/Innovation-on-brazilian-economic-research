This  study  investigates  how  the  fiscal  credibility  affects  the  inflation  rate  in  an  emerging 
economy under inflation target. Based on the Brazilian experience, a fiscal credibility index is 
built  taking  into  account  how  the  market  expectations  are  anchored  to  the  primary  surplus 
target. The main idea is that a government that is able to anchor expectations around the target 
(case of high credibility) may reduce inflation. The findings provide empirical evidence that 
the success of government in achieving the fiscal primary surplus target (gain of credibility) is 
an important ally to reduce inflation rate and its expectations. 
Key words: fiscal credibility, inflation, primary surplus, inflation targeting. 
 

Resumo 

Este estudo investiga  como  a credibilidade fiscal afeta  a taxa de inflação em  uma economia 
emergente sob o regime de metas de inflação. Com base na experiência brasileira, um índice 
de credibilidade fiscal é construído levando-se em conta como as expectativas de mercado são 
ancoradas  à  meta  de  superávit  primário.  A  ideia  principal  é  a  de  que  um  governo  capaz  de 
ancorar as expectativas em torno da meta (caso de alta credibilidade) pode reduzir a inflação. 
Os resultados evidenciam que o sucesso do governo em produzir a meta de superávit primário 
(ganho  de  credibilidade)  é  um  importante  aliado  para  reduzir  tanto  a  taxa  quanto  as

1. Introduction 
 

 

A  sound  fiscal  position  is  essential  to  any  economy.  Since  the  1990s  the  growing 

concern with  inflation  has brought several  countries to  adopt  inflation  targeting. There exist 

several studies which indicate that the use of this monetary framework represents a success in 

the control of inflation (e.g. Lin and Ye, 2009; and de Mendonça and de Guimarães e Souza, 

2012).  However,  one  of  the  preconditions  to  the  success  of  inflation  targeting  is  the  fiscal 

balance.  It  is  well-known  that  in  the  case  where  the  government  is  not  committed  to  fiscal 

balance, the result is a pressure on inflation due to the risk of expansionary monetary policy 

and  to  finance  public  debts.  In  brief,  there  exists  a  relationship  between  government  fiscal 

commitment and inflation. 

 

An important issue in the analysis regarding inflation targeting is credibility because it 

plays  an  essential  role  in  the  commitment  of  reaching  low  and  stable  inflation.  Although  a 

great part of the literature pays attention only to the credibility of the monetary authority, this 

is only one side of the coin. Following the literature that builds on Sargent e Wallace (1981), 

unsustainable  fiscal  police  may  lead  the  monetary  authority  to  monetize  fiscal  deficits  and 

thus  wreck  credibility.  Based  on  a  different  view,  scholars  from  fiscal  theory  of  price  level 

(e.g.  Woodford,  2001;  and  Sims,  1994)  argue  that  the  control  of  money  supply  is  not  a 

sufficient  condition  to  stabilize  inflation.  In  brief,  the  government  solvency  is  essential  to 

monetary policy being able to control inflation.  

 

This  study  investigates  how  the  fiscal  credibility  affects  the  inflation  rate  in  an 

emerging economy under inflation target. The analysis on the Brazilian case after adoption of 

inflation  targeting  is  useful,  as  with  Chile  and  Poland,  this  country  announces  the  inflation 

target jointly by the government and central bank in order to make the government commit to 

the  fiscal  discipline  needed  to  achieve  the  target.  Moreover,  Brazil  has  had  explicit  fiscal 

primary  surplus  targets  since  2000,  and  expectations  of  variables  (e.g.  inflation  rate  and 

primary surplus) are  available from  the Time Series Management System  - Central  Bank of 

Brazil (TSMS/CBB). The main idea is that a government  that is able to anchor expectations 

around  the  target  (case  of  high  credibility)  may  reduce  inflation.  The  results  in  this  study 

provide  empirical  evidence  that  the  success  of  government  in  achieving  the  fiscal  primary 

surplus target (gain of credibility) contributes to the reduction of inflation.  

Few  studies  analyze  the  impact  of  fiscal  credibility  on  inflation  rate  in  emerging 

economies.  For  an  analysis  of  the  pass-through  on  inflation  for  the  Brazilian  economy,  de 

Mendonça  and  Tostes  (2015),  taking  into  account  the  fiscal  credibility  index  built  by  de 

 

2 

 

 

Mendonça and Machado (2013), found that fiscal credibility is an important tool for reducing 

inflation. Kuncoro (2015) in an analysis regarding Indonesia concluded that fiscal credibility 

is important for price stabilization in the inflation targeting framework. 

 

This  study differs  from  these above-mentioned in several  dimensions.  It  is important 

to  highlight  that  the  indicator  of  fiscal  credibility  in  de  Mendonça  and  Machado  (2013)  is 

based  on  the  deviations  of  the  market  expectations  on  public  debt-to-GDP  in  relation  to  the 

prudential  benchmark  suggested  by  International  Monetary  Fund.  Moreover,  the  index  used 

by Kuncoro (2015) quantifies the fiscal rules credibility measure using the deviation of actual 

budget from the projected one. In a different manner, the fiscal credibility index in this study 

takes  into  account  how  the  market  expectations  are  anchored  to  the  primary  surplus  target. 

Therefore,  we  consider  a  true  fiscal  commitment  announced  previously  by  the  government. 

This  procedure  is  in  agreement  with  the  well-known  definition  of  credibility  made  by 

Cukierman  and  Meltzer  (1986),  which  can  be  understood  as  the  difference  between  the 

policymaker’s  plans  and  the  public’s  beliefs  about  those  plans.  Furthermore,  we  provide 

empirical  evidence  regarding  the  effect  of  fiscal  credibility  on  inflation  rate,  inflation  of 

market  prices,  inflation  of  administered  prices,  and  inflation  expectations,  based  on  the 

structural  model  adopted  by  Central  Bank  of  Brazil  (CBB)  through  Ordinary  Least  Squares 

(OLS)  and  Generalized  Method  of  Moments  (GMM)  regressions.  Furthermore,  a  vector 

autoregression  model  (VAR)  is  also  performed  for  the  period  January  2003  to  December 

2015. 

 

The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 makes a presentation of 

the measurement of the fiscal credibility in Brazil for the period from 2003 to 2015. Section 3 

presents the data and methodology used in this study. Section 4 provides empirical evidence, 

through an econometric analysis, of the effect of the fiscal credibility on inflation. Section 5 

concludes the paper. 

  

2. Measuring fiscal credibility in Brazil 

 
 

It  is  a  challenge  to  summarize  the  government’s  ability  in  guiding  the  expectation 

process  of  the  economic  agents  through  only  one  measurement  (fiscal  credibility  index).  It 

involves  multiple  dimensions  such  as:  the  intertemporal  nature  of  fiscal  sustainability;  the 

empirical  limits  for  the  public  debt-to-GDP  growth  ratio;  the  risk  perception  about  possible 

fiscal dominance scenarios; the institutional setting and accountability of fiscal policy; and the 

effects of political and electoral cycles on fiscal authorities. In this context, we build an index 

 

3 

 

 

which starts from two criteria: (i) because the index under construction is a limited variable, 

instead  of  using  variables  like  debt-to-GDP  ratio  (see,  de  Mendonça  and  Machado,  2013), 

which usually follow a non-stationary stochastic process, stationary fiscal flow measurement 

is  used;  and  (ii)  the  use  of  a  reference  for  exogenous  expectation  guidance  based  on  a  very 

well defined lower bound for the fiscal flow variable which is publicly preannounced for the 

next year.  

 

The one-step-ahead expectations of fiscal primary surplus are the natural candidate for 

being the main information for a fiscal credibility index because the fiscal primary surplus is 

the  adjustment  component  in  the  nominal  deficit  that  could  ensure  the  fulfillment  of  the 

intertemporal  budget  restriction.  In  addition,  the  expectations  of  fiscal  primary  surplus  are 

measured  as  a  ratio-to-GDP  (usually  a  stationary  process)  and  represent  the  median  of 

financial market institutions expectations for the next year for the fiscal primary surplus. This 

information  is  extracted  from  a  daily  survey  of  market  expectations  conducted  by  Central 

Bank  of  Brazil  (CBB)  for  the  evolution  of  the  main  Brazilian  macroeconomic  variables 

(Focus Market Readout). 

 

It  is  important  to  highlight  that  since  the  promulgation  of  the  Fiscal  Responsibility 

Law in  2000 the government has to  define annual  goals  for fiscal  variables for execution  in 

current  year  and  the  next  two  years,  publicly  announced  as  an  Annex  of  Budget  Guidelines 

Law  (Lei  de  Diretrizes  Orçamentárias  –  LDO)  by  September  of  the  previous  year.  In  other 

words,  this  information  represents  a  benchmark  for  macroeconomic  forecasts,  and  thus,  the 

goals for fiscal primary surplus (FPS*) are the essence of the fiscal credibility index in order 

to  evaluate  the  performance  and  ability  of  the  government  to  anchor  expectations.  Table  1 

shows these goals and their respective laws.2 

 

It  is  a  fact  that  expectations  deteriorate  faster  as  the  fiscal  primary  surplus  is  lower 

than the target. Hence, the use of different intervals creates an asymmetrical framework which 

is useful in the measurement of credibility. In this context, two intervals are considered in the 

index: (i) an ideal interval which corresponds to a very good performance of the government 

regarding 

the 

primary 

surplus 

in 

reaching 

the 

target, 

that 

is, 

;  and  (ii)  a  tolerance  interval  which  represents  an 

acceptable  performance  given  by 

.  Taking  into 

consideration the idea above, a fiscal credibility index is elaborated (FCRED), which assumes 

                                                           
2 Some  fiscal  surplus  goals  were  revised  within  the  current  year.  Those  revisions  were  not  considered  because 
they do not affect the expectations formed during the previous year.

a  loss  in  credibility  when  the  average  of  the  market  expectations  on  fiscal  primary  surplus 

(E(FPS)), indicates the expectation  that the government is  not  capable of bringing the fiscal 

primary surplus to the ideal interval or to the tolerance interval around the target.

Therefore,  when  the  expectation  on  fiscal  primary  surplus  is  found  between  the  lower 

bound 

 and  the  upper  bound 

of  the  ideal  interval,  the  credibility  is  full 

(assumes value 1). In contrast, fiscal credibility is null (assumes value 0) when expectation on 

fiscal  primary surplus is  out  of the  tolerance  interval 

. Furthermore, the 

index  assumes  a  value  between  0  and  1  when  market  expectations  are  inside  the  intervals 

and 

,  and  decreases  as  expectations  deviate  from  the 

ideal interval. Hence,

primary  surplus  and  expectations  for  the  next  year  for  the  fiscal  primary  surplus  which  are 

essential for building the credibility index, is presented in figure 1.3 In general, it is possible 

to identify two phases. The first, before the subprime crisis (2007), inflation expectations are 

inside the tolerance interval and near the primary surplus target  practically  all  the time. The 

second represents a deterioration of the expectations and they exceed the lower bound of the 

tolerance interval most of the time. 

 

 

Goals for fiscal primary surplus and expectations 

Figure 1 

 

Figure  2  shows  the  performance  of  fiscal  credibility  from  2003  to  2015  in  Brazil.  A 

clear trend of worsening over time is observed. In large measure, the subprime crisis implied a 

change  of  the  fiscal  stance  in  the  Brazilian  economy.  As  pointed  out  by  CBB,  the 

intensification  of  the  effects  of  the  international  financial  crisis  on  the  internal  expectations 

prompted  the  government  to  adopt  expansionist  fiscal  measures.  As  a  consequence,  “in 

December  2008  tax  cuts  were  introduced  which  favored  the  credit  market  conditions  and 

propitiated  expansion  of  consumers’  available  income.  In  this  sense,  noteworthy  is  the 

adjustment  of  the  progressive  income  tax  table  to  the  growth  of  nominal  wages  of  the 

economy; the reductions of IPI rates levied on the purchase of new vehicles and trucks, and of 

the Financial Operations Tax (IOF) levied on loans granted to individuals; the creation of two 

intermediate  rates,  of  7.5%  and  22.5%,  of  the  table  of  the  Individual  Income  Tax  (IRPF),

there is a clear downturn in fiscal credibility.

3. Data and methodology 
 

 

 

In  order  to  observe  the  possible  impact  of  the  fiscal  credibility  on  inflation  rate,  the 

period under analysis is  from  January 2003 to  December 2015 (156 observations  – monthly 

frequency). This analysis starts in January 2003 because this is when the Brazilian economy 

eliminated the negative effects caused by the confidence crises due to the election of President 

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and when, for example, new information started being released by 

CBB such as Brazilian Economic Activity Index (IBC-Br).  

The official price index that is used to measure inflation rate in Brazil is the National 

Consumer  Price  Index  (extended)  –  IPCA.  In  general,  prices  are  a  result  of  market  prices 

(prices  resultant  of  market  force)  and  administered  prices  (prices  defined  by  contracts  and 

prices that are monitored, depending on government authorization).4 Administered prices are 

divided into tax, public utility services, and petroleum derivatives, which in turn, are slightly 

sensitive to the market forces. Moreover, inflation expectations are an essential component to 

be analyzed under inflation targeting system.

With the intention of observing the relation between the fiscal credibility and inflation 

rate  in  the  Brazilian  economy,  the  first  empirical  procedure  is  straightforward.  We  present 

four  scatterplots  and  correlations  for  fiscal  credibility  (FCRED)  and  its  relation  with:  full 

inflation rate (INF), inflation of market prices (INFM), inflation of administered prices (INFA), 

and inflation expectations (E(INF)) respectively (see figure 4). With exception for the case of 

administered prices, there exists a negative correlation (around -0.3) to other cases, which in 

turn,  suggests  that  fiscal  credibility  may  reduce  inflation  rate  and  reinforces  the  causal 

hypothesis to be tested econometrically. 

 

A  simple  manner  of  observing  how  fiscal  credibility  can  affect  inflation  under 

inflation  targeting  is  through  a  Phillips  curve.  Because  credibility  is  a  forward-looking 

concept  (see  de  Mendonça  and  de  Guimarães  e  Souza,  2009)  and  taking  as  reference  the 

version  of  the  Phillips  curve  used  in  the  structural  model  adopted  by  CBB  when  inflation 

targeting  was  adopted  in  June  of  1999  (see  Bogdanski,  Tombini,  and  Werlang,  2000),  the 

following equation is considered:5

In order to see the effect of fiscal credibility on inflation of market prices, inflation of 

administered prices, and inflation expectations, equation (2) is rewritten in the following way: 

 

(3)     

(4)     

(5)     

where:  

 

 

 

 - is the inflation measured by IPCA - non monitored prices; and 

 - is the inflation 

measured by IPCA - supervised prices – total. 

In  this  framework,  the  impact  of  the  variable  FCRED  on  inflation  rate  is 

straightforward.  From  the  theoretical  view  it  is  expected  that  the  results  indicate  a  negative 

and  significant  coefficient  on  FCRED  (5,11,17,22<0).  The  negative  impact  of  the 

credibility  on  inflation  is  in  consonance  with  the  view  that  a  greater  commitment  with  the 

fiscal  goals  increases the power of the  central  bank to  achieve the target  and thus  to  anchor 

inflation expectations. 

 

In  general,  the  use  of  time  series  data  in  estimations  needs  to  analyze  whether  the 

series  in  the  model  have  a  unit  root  (non-stationary  data  series)  to  avoid  the  possibility  of 

spurious  regression.  Hence,  the  Augmented  Dickey–Fuller  (ADF),  Phillips-Perron  (PP),  and 

Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests are performed. The results indicate that all 

series are I(0) (see table A.3 – appendix).6  

In order to  estimate the  equations  (2),  (3), (4), and (5),  this study  uses two methods: 

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). These methods 

are  useful  to  observe  the  impact  caused  by  the  fiscal  credibility  on  inflation  rate  (and  its 

variations) through a direct observation of the estimated parameters.  

In  general,  macroeconomic  time  series  models  are  subject  to  the  problem  of 

endogeneity. Moreover, the fact that the series have monthly frequency may still have issues 

of heteroscedasticity in the regressions. Hence, OLS method cannot performs well under these 

issues.  Therefore,  in  order  to  deal  with  these  problems  the  GMM  is  used.  A  condition  for 

efficient  estimation  based  on  GMM  is  that  overriding  restrictions  need  to  be  respected 

(Woodridge,  2001).  In  this  context,  all  regressions  present  the  J-statistic  as  a  test  for  over-

                                                           
6 The main criticisms of those tests are their lack of power (low probability of rejection when the null is false), as 
our  general  results  were  rejection  over  non-stationarity  we  considered  unnecessary  to  perform  other  tests. 
Moreover,  our  fiscal  credibility  index  is  not  tested  for  nonstationarity  because  it  is  a  limited  variable  by 
construction.

In  order  to  observe  the  relevance  of  the  credibility  effect  on  inflation  (full  IPCA), 

inflation  of  market  prices,  inflation  of  administered  prices,  and  inflation  expectations  over 

time,  this  study  besides  the  OLS  and  GMM  models  provides  empirical  evidence  through 

Vector  Autoregressive  (VAR)  models. 8 In  general,  the  analysis  of  VAR  is  made  through 

impulse  response  functions  because  it  allows  one  to  see  the  impulse  of  fiscal  credibility  on 

inflation  rate  and  inflation  expectations  caused  by  shocks  (or  innovations)  provoked  by 

residual variables over time. As suggested by Koop, Pesaran, and Potter (1996) and Pesaran 

and Shin (1998), this study makes use of the generalized impulse response function (impulse 

responses  are  invariant  to  any  re-ordering  of  the  variables  in  the  VAR)  because  it  provides 

more robust results than the orthogonalized method. 

  

4. Empirical evidence 
 

This  section  presents  some  empirical  evidence  on  the  impact  of  the  fiscal  credibility 

on  inflation  (full  IPCA),  inflation  of  market  prices,  inflation  of  administered  prices,  and 

inflation expectations in the Brazilian economy. The analysis is divided into three steps. In the 

first step we present OLS estimations. The second step presents GMM estimations. Finally, in 

the  third  step,  we  observe  the  response  of  the  inflation  rate  and  its  variations  to  a  shock 

transmitted by the fiscal credibility through impulse-response analysis. 

The  coefficients  for  the  OLS  estimations  are  in  consonance  with  the  theoretical 

perspective  (see  table  2).  The  negative  and  significant  coefficients  on  fiscal  credibility 

observed for the regressions on inflation (full IPCA), inflation of market prices, and inflation 

expectations  are  in  line  with  the  first  impression  from  the  correlation  observed  in  figure  5. 

This observation is a clear indication that the government commitment with the fiscal primary 

surplus target (high credibility) is an important mechanism to reduce inflation rate. This result 

comes as no surprise because one of the main pillars for the success of inflation targeting is 

the  sustained  fiscal  balance.  In  this  context,  a  breach  of  the  Brazilian  government  with  the 

fiscal  surplus  (low  credibility)  target  denotes  a  lack  of  the  commitment  to  ensure  an 

                                                           
7 In order to eliminate skewing the results, the maximum of lags applied for each instrument was 9. In addition, 
the  number  of  instruments  in  all  models  is  less  than  14%  in  relation  to  the  total  of  observations)  –  the 
instruments are listed in the appendix (see table A.4). 
8 Based on Schwarz (SIC), Akaike (AIC), and Hannan-Quinn (HQ) criteria, the VAR order is 2 (see table A.5). 
Furthermore, VARs satisfy the stability condition (see figure A.1 – appendix).

environment that supports the reaching of the inflation target. The non-significance for fiscal 

credibility  in  the  explanation  of  inflation  of  administered  prices  can  be  a  consequence  that 

prices are defined by contracts and thus  are less  subject to the success of the government in 

the achievement of the targets. 

Besides the coefficients on fiscal credibility, the coefficients on the other variables for 

the  explanation  of  the  dependent  variables  shown  in  table  2  are  in  line  with  the  theoretical 

view.  The  positive  and  significant  coefficient  on  inflation  expectations  in  most  models  is 

coherent  with  the  argument  that  the  forward-looking  behavior  of  economic  agents  is  crucial 

for  the  success  of  inflation  targeting.  The  negative  and  significant  coefficient  on  the  output 

gap in most models regarding inflation (INF, INFM, and INFA) reflects the fact that Brazil has 

experienced  a  low  and  negative  growth  rate  in  a  large  part  of  the  period  under  analysis. 

Although  the  coefficient  on  the  variable  that  captures  the  effect  on  the  external  shocks 

transmitted to inflation is positive in most of models, the non-significance is a result that the 

exchange rate was overvalued most of the time.

The  coefficients  for  the  GMM  estimations  (see  table  3)  do  not  present  significant 

changes in terms of sign and statistical significance when they are compared with those in the 

OLS estimations (see table 1).  Therefore, the results are in line with the assumption that the 

fiscal credibility is an important element to decrease inflation rate and its expectations.

Extending the analysis regarding the impact  of the fiscal  credibility on  inflation  rate, 

inflation  of  market  prices,  inflation  of  administered  prices,  and  inflation  expectations,  the 

previous results from OLS and GMM models are confirmed through the generalized impulse-

response  functions  plotted  out  to  the  36th  month.  Figure  5  suggests  that  an  unexpected 

positive shock on fiscal credibility provokes a significant  decrease in inflation rate, inflation 

of market prices, and inflation expectations. We can see that the negative effect on inflation 

due  to  a  shock  transmitted  through  fiscal  credibility  takes  around  9  months  to  become 

significant and remains significant for about 6 months. A similar effect is valid for the case of 

 

13 

 

 

inflation  of  market  prices.  An  unexpected  positive  shock  on  fiscal  credibility  provokes  a 

significant  decrease in  inflation  of market  prices after 6 months and abides significant  for  6 

more  months.  In  the  same  vein,  a  shock  transmitted  by  fiscal  credibility  also  provokes  a 

negative impact on inflation expectations. However, the statistical significance of this effect is 

considerably  greater  than  that  observed  for  the  previous  cases.  Finally,  such  as  presented  in 

the  OLS  and  GMM  estimations,  the  effect  of  fiscal  credibility  on  inflation  of  administered 

prices is not observed.

expectations, in the Brazilian economy after the adoption of inflation targeting. One important 

contribution  in  this  study  was  the  elaboration  of  a  fiscal  credibility  index  based  on  how  the 

market expectations are anchored to the primary surplus target. The findings suggest that the 

success of government in achieving the fiscal primary surplus target (gain of credibility) is an 

important ally to reduce inflation rate and its expectations.
