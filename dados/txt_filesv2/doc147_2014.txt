Resumo 
A proposta do estudo é a detectar áreas emergente de pesquisa em bionergia usando um 
método baseado em medidas topológicas que se aplicam a redes de publicação científicas. 
O trabalho apresenta um esforço metodológico para tratar com dados baseados em 
trabalhos relacionados à bionergia utilizando palavras –chave sem a aplicação prévia de 
filtros. Os dados foram coletados do Instituto de Informação Científica (ISI)  através do 
Banco de dados do Web of  Science (WOS). Como resultado 244.307 artigos foram obtidos. 
Os resultados da pesquisa revelam que um agrupamento emergiu nos anos recentes, que 
todavia não é homogêneo do ponto de vista de seu conteúdo científico. Com isto, um novo 
processo de agrupamento foi realizado utilizando os trabalhos do agrupamento emergente 
(cluster). A análise mostra a obtenção de um sub-cluster que tem a propriedade de ser 
emergente e que está claramente identificado com bioenergia. Este sub-cluster emergente 
trouxe junto estudos de bioenergia e de biocombustíveis de terceira geração e temas de 
sustentabilidade da bioenergia, áreas de pesquisa de fronteira.

Abstract 
The  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  detect  emerging  areas  of  research  on  Bioenergy  using  a 
method  based  on  topological  measures  applied  to  scientific  publication  networks.  This 
paper  presents  a  methodological  effort  to  deal  with  a  data  base  of  papers  related  to 
bioenergy  using  key  words  without  the  definition  of  filters  previously  applied.  The  data 
was collected from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) through the Web of Science 
(WoS)  database.  As  a  result,  244,307  scientific  articles  were  obtained.  The  results  of  the 
research reveals one cluster has emerged in recent years; however, it also shows that this 
is  not  homogenous.  So,  it  was  performed  a  new  clusterization  that  considered  only  the 
papers from the emergent cluster. This analysis allows to achieve an emergent sub-cluster 
clearly identified with the themes of bioenergy. The emergent sub-cluster brings together 
studies  from  bioenergy  and  third-generation  biofuel  sustainability,  two  areas  that  also 
represent cutting-edge research. 
Key words: bioenergy, clusters, citation networks, topological measures.

Energy Fields of Research are defined on the basis of a systematic application of the technical 
and  scientific  knowledge  of  agents  who  compete  in  a  context  of  selective  market  processes, 
characterizing a science based area of economy (BELL; PAVITT, 1992). These processes take 
different  trajectories  and  generate  different  patterns  of  technology  diffusion  within  firms, 
between  firms,  among  firms  in  the  same  industry,  between  industries  and  sectors  in  different 
countries, particularly USA and Brazil, the leading  countries on  ethanol  production nowadays. 
(KAMM ET ALLI, 2008; BROWN; BROWN, 2013; HLPE, 2013). 
This  present  study  detects  emerging  areas  of  research  using  a  method  based  on  topological 
measures applied to scientific publication networks, which was originally proposed by Shibata et 
al.  (2008),  when  the  authors  analyzed  scientific  articles  on  regenerative  medicine.  In  another 
report by Shibata et al. (2011), the same method was used to analyze emerging areas of research 
on gallium nitride and in complex networks.  
The tight connection between scientific and technological development and innovation justifies 
the 
bioenergy 
(GLANZEL;SCHUBERT, 2004;PEREIRA; BAZI, 2009, ). Efforts to detect emerging areas of 
research can be made using two alternative and complementary areas: a) experts in a given area 
of  study;  and  b)  computational  techniques  (KOSTOFF;  SCHALLER,  2001).  The  use  of 
specialist  panels  involves  the  difficulty  that  comes  from  the  rapid  growth  of  scientific 
knowledge, which causes the analysis of results to go through the lens of an analysis founded on 
a wider range of qualified information, a range that can also identify biases that are determined 
by  the  specialization  of  those  who  are  interviewed.  The  other  approach  is  based  on 
computational techniques, which involve fewer problems that result from the increased amount 
of information, and which can complement a study performed with specialists.  
The studies by Fontana et al (2009); Ribeiro et al (2010), Kraft, Quatraro, and Saviotti (2009), 
Saviotti, (2009) provide important clues for this investigation, but it was the observation of the 
results of the papers written by Dal-Poz et al (2012) and Silveira et al (2013) that motivated this 
study. They defined the area of bioenergy as an emerging area of research, but they based their 
opinion  on  distinct  methodological  procedures  that  were  themselves  based  on  patents.  Their 
studies generated modest results in terms of the number of patents found with the use of filters 
(specifically in specific classes of patents). The methodological treatment based on Shibata et al 
(2008) and Shibata et al (2011) provided a viable alternative for avoiding any type of filter in the 
search process, and also permitted a more multi-faceted treatment of the citation networks. This 
treatment will become clearer later in the text.  
The results of the research suggest a large growth in the number of studies in scientific areas that 
correspond to the  key words that were used. The exploratory nature of the study  means that a 
wide range of key words are used so that the area of bioenergy can be found and the areas of 
knowledge  that  it  brings  together  can  be  better  specified,  without  imposing  any  a  priori 
restrictions that may exclude important papers. that with their removal, the networks would be 
destroyed (JACKSON, 2009). The methodology developed in this study is presented in Section 
2. Section 3 presents the results obtained and the comments on these results. Section 5 presents 
the conclusions. 

2. Methodology 

2.1 Methodological Procedures 

The methodology presented below is developed by the authors based on Shibata et al (2008) and 
Shibata et al. (2011).The following procedures are applied: 
1)  Collect  data  on  citations  from  the  Sciences  Citation  Index,  compiled  by  the  Institute  for 
Scientific  Information  (ISI),  which  keeps  databanks  of  citations  that  include  thousands  of 
academic  journals  and  offer  bibliographical  database  services.  To  perform  this  step,  Web  of 
Science (WoS) was used. It is an interface for the end user based on the web of citation databases 
from ISI; 2) Construct citation networks for each year, in which the articles are the nodes and the 
citations  are  the  links,  or  connections,  between  the  nodes;  3)  Eliminate  the  isolate,  it  means, 
articles that do not cite other papers in the network, thus maintaining only the main components 
of the network. The  goal of this step is to exclude papers that are not part of the network and 
which were part of the results because of the wide range of the terms used in the search; 4)Apply 
the  Newman  Algorithm  (NEWMAN,  2004)  to  divide  the  network  into  groups  and  to  identify 
each of the groups; 5) Visualize the citation network and determine the weight of each paper in 
the cluster and its  coefficient of involvement in the clusters; extract the characteristic terms of 
each  cluster  using  both  a  linguistic  filter  based  on  the  abstracts  of  the  papers  and  Natural 
Language Processing (NLP), (FRANTZI et al., 2000). 

 

Figure 1 Methodology of the Paper: 

                      Source: Shibata et al. (2011). 
 
In step 5, the degree of importance of each paper (represented in the network by the nodes), is 
determined  by  the  paper's  relevance  within  the  cluster  (GUIMERA;  AMARAL,  2005) 
represented by:  

in which 

 is the mean of 

 is the number of connections of a node   relative to the other nodes in its cluster 

, 
,. Thus, 
 of a node within a cluster is positive when  the number of connections 

 the standard deviation of 

 over all of the nodes in 

, and 

 in 

the degree of relevance 
(degree) of the node has within the cluster is above the mean value.  

 

To analyze a given term involvement in the clusters, which reveals the extent of the distribution 
of the connections of a given node 
 among the different clusters, the following equation must 
be used:  

 

 is the total degree of the node 

,  or the number of links connected to the node 

 is the number of links of a given node   to the other nodes in the cluster 

, and in 
in which 
which 
. A 
coefficient of involvement 
 close to one indicates that the connections are uniformly distributed 
among all of the clusters, while a coefficient close to zero indicates that all of the connections are 
within  the  node's  own  cluster,  as  shown  by  Guimera  and  Amaral  (2005)  and  Shibata  et  al. 
(2011).The two indicators are used to define the position of the nodes in regions that define, for 
example,  high  relevance  (increased  weight)  of  the  study  (if  it  existed  in  an  above-average 
number  of  citations)  and  an  increased  presence  in  a  given  cluster.  The  studies  located  in  this 
region  are  indicators  of  knowledge  that  has  an  influence  and  is  specialized.  These  factors  are 
very important in cases with a large number of results in the searches performed using the key 
words. 
 To  analyze  the  content  of  each  cluster,  Natural  Language  Processing  (NPL)  must  be  used.  It 
allows for the detection of the research topic of each cluster. The terms are extracted from the 
abstracts  of  the  articles  using  linguistic  filters  (FRANTZI  et  al.,  2000).  The  filters  extract  the 
terms  bound  by  elements  that,  when  inserted  in  the  sentence,  make  up  a  significant  unit,  thus 
maintaining dependent relations and order among the terms. Finally, it is important to note that 
the greatest challenges to compiling this information is in both the application of techniques of 
different areas of knowledge and the implementation of grouping methods, as well as of NLP. 

2.2 Key Words and Data Sources  

(Biofuel*)  OR 

(Cellulos*)  OR 

The  data  was  collected  from  the  Institute  for  Scientific  Information  (ISI)  through  the  Web  of 
Science (WoS) database. The collection was performed based on the following search criteria: 
(Bioconversion  AND  biomass)  OR 
(Ethanol)  OR 
(Lignocellulosic*) OR (Hemicellulose*) OR (Enzyme* AND Sugarcane*) OR (Fermentacion*) 
OR (Saccharification*) OR (Sugarcane* AND Delignification*) OR (Xylose*) OR (Hydrolisi* 
AND Enzyme*) OR (Hydrolisi* AND Cellulos*) OR (Hydrolisi* AND Ethanol). Papers from 
every year were accepted, but only the scientific articles were used. As a result, 244,307 papers 
were obtained. 
The studies performed in the ISI via WoS can be saved 500 papers at a time; thus, 489 papers 
were  obtained.  The  authors  developed  an  algorithm  in  AppleScript  language  to  automate  the 
download of data.  In order to  bring together the files that were downloaded and  to extract the 
data  from  the  citation  network,  the  Bibexcel  software  was  used  (PERSSON;  DANELL; 
WIBORG;  SCHENEIDER,  2009).  To  create  the  networks,  graphs,  and  tables,  the  software 
known as R was used (R CORE TEAM, 2014), with the iGraph packages (CSARDI; NEPSUZ, 
2006), ggplot2 packages (WICKHAM, 2009), plyr packages (WICHAM, 2011), Hmisc packages 
(FRANK; HARREL Jr, 2014) and tm packages (FEINERER; HORNIK , 2014). 

3. Results 

There has been significant growth in the number of papers obtained using the research criteria 
described in Step 1 of Section 2.1, particularly after 1990, as shown in Figure 1. Between 1945 
and 2013, the volume of annual publications went from 55 papers per year to 18,406 papers per 
year. The  amount of  papers obtained using the  research  criteria described in Step 1  represents 
significant  growth  in  the  amount  of  publications  over  the  years,  as  seen  in  Figure  2.  Between 
1945 and 2013, the volume of annual publications went from 55 papers per year to 18,406 papers 
per year.

After  Step  3  was  performed,  only  the  giant  component  of  the  network  was  maintained,  and 
193,555 papers remained. To perform Step 4 of applying an algorithm to divide the network into 
groups,  the  optimized  version  of  the  Newman  algorithm  (2004)  was  used  (written  by  Clauset, 
Newman, and Moore, 2004). It is important to note that, in order to create a cumulative citation 
network,  an  article  published  in  1990  is  considered  part  of  the  1990  network,  as  well  as  the 
networks of all of the following years. Thus, a clustering process is performed for each year, and 
each article can change groups from one year to the next.  
Figure 3 shows the result of the clusterization process, in which the clusters from 1995 to 2013 
were maintained if they contained more than 500 papers. Circles represent clusters, and the size 
of each circle indicates the relative value of the number of papers in each cluster. The average 
age  of  each  cluster  indicates  the  average  age  of  the  papers  that  make  up  the  cluster;  thus,  the 
lower the position of the circle in the coordinate plane, the newer the papers that make up the 
cluster, and the higher the value, the older the papers in the cluster are.

The B5 cluster is comprised of 24,725 papers. The average year of publication is 1997; thus, the 
average age of the papers in 2013 was 16. From 2005 on, an increase in the average age of the 
B5 cluster papers occurred; meanwhile, the average age of the papers in the B3 and B6 clusters 
decreased. An analysis of the trajectory of the B5 cluster indicates a high similarity among the 
papers included in the B5 cluster: that is to say, most of the papers in the B5 clusters in a given 
year would also be present in the B5 cluster in the following years. The composition of the B5 
cluster  indicates  that  the  contributions  of  this  cluster  are  based  on  established  papers,  or 
incremental innovations.  
The B8 cluster is comprised of 25,083 papers. The average year of publication is 2006, and the 
average age of papers in 2013 is 7. The contributions of these papers that make up the B8 cluster 
tend to be based on more recent scientific articles, a finding which indicates the possibility for 
radical  innovation.  However,  the  point  at  which  the  cluster  comes  about  is  not  clear,  a  factor 
which suggests that the cluster may be heterogeneous and may have papers from more than one 
area of research. 
To visualize the network shown in Figure 4, the Gephi software was used (Bastian; Heymann; 
Jacomy, 2009) with the  ForceAtlas  2 layout.  Note that the B5  cluster (red) and the B7  cluster 
(yellow) present a high degree of connection that was already visible in 2002, a finding which 
indicates that they cover traditional areas of research. The B3 cluster (purple) is also visible in 
2002;  however,  it  presents  a  greater  expansion  than  the  B5  and  B7  clusters.  The  B8  cluster 
(green), however, emerged more recently and can be clearly seen in 2013. It is also important to 
note  that  the  papers  in  the  B8  cluster  are  dispersed,  which  suggests  low  similarity  among  the 

citations of the papers that make up the group. This factor suggests that this cluster tends to be 
more heterogeneous than the others.

To determine whether the innovations are incremental or  radical, the within-cluster degree (zi) 
and the participation coefficient (Pi) were calculated for the 10 most frequently cited papers for 
the last 10 years. The idea is to know how well positioned the papers are in their own clusters 
and among clusters, given that vertices with the same role take on similar topological positions 
(GUIMERA;  AMARAL,  2005).  Areas  of  research  with  high  z  and  P  values  suggest  that  the 
innovations are incremental, while a high  z value and a low  P value occurs in cases of radical 
innovations (SHIBATA et al., 2011).

Figure 5 Role of each node in the topology. 

 

The classification established by Guimera and Amaral (2005) suggests that the nodes with z<2.5 
are  hubs,  while  those  with  z<2.5  are  considered  non-hubs,  as  seen  in  Figure  5.  The  non-hub 
nodes are divided into four categories: (A1) outermost nodes, or nodes with most of their links 
within their cluster; (A2) peripheral nodes, or nodes with many links within their cluster; (A3) 
non-hub connecting nodes, or those with an increased proportion of links with other clusters; and 
(A4) non-hub kinless nodes, or nodes with edges that are homogeneously distributed among all 
clusters.  
Figure 5 shows that many of the nodes are distributed among (A5), (A6), (A2) and (A3), and an 
explicit innovation pattern could not be identified. Because the amount  of papers found in the 
search was higher (a factor which indicates that the field of study is wide), it is natural for space 
for  incremental  and  radical  innovation  to  occur  simultaneously  within  the  area  of  Bioenergy 
research. 
The  next  point  to  clarify  is  the  content  researched  in  the  papers  in  each  cluster,  which  is 
investigated through analyses of the abstract of each paper, presented in the Table 1, below.

As  seen  in  Figure  3,  above,    the  emerging  cluster  is  the  B8  cluster,  with  25,083  papers,  the 
average year of publication of which is 2006. Figure 3 shows that the B8 cluster has emerged in 
recent  years; however, it also shows that this is not homogenous: the papers that make up this 
cluster may belong to subareas of knowledge within studies on Bioenergy.  
To perform a better analysis of the content of the B8 cluster, a new clusterization was performed 
that considered only the papers from the B8 cluster. It can be seen in Figure 6. It is important to 
note the presence of four large groups: G1, with 4,756 papers; G2 with 3,212 papers; G3 with 
1,969 papers; and G4 with 4,769 papers. As was mentioned previously, the network created by 
the B8 cluster presents a low degree of similarity, since the citations are more intra-group than 
inter-group, what is an interesting result.

To determine  the content of each emerging sub-cluster, which  are highlighted in  Figure 6, the 
multi-word  terms  of  the  abstracts  of  the  papers  from  the  main  clusters  were  analyzed.  These 
main clusters represent a sub-division of the B8 cluster, as seen in Table 3.

Figure 7. Role of each node in the topology from cluster B8 

The analysis of the sub- clusters and of Cluster 8 reveals significant differences among them, as 
well  as  the  cluster's  adherence  to  areas  on  the  front  lines  of  bioenergy  research.  G1  strongly 
involves  advances  in  the  enabling  technologies  of  processes,  which  are  supported  in  radical 
innovations and connected to nanotechnology. G2 and G3 are close and involve developments in 

 

the  area  of  fuel  cells,  or,  more  specifically,  motors,  research  which  is  also  supported  by 
nanotechnology.  G4  brings  together  studies  from  bioenergy  and  third-generation  biofuel 
sustainability, two areas that also represent cutting-edge research.  
As  was  expected,  the  involvement  values  for  the  10  most  frequently  cited  papers  over  time 
(1945-2013) are lower than the values for the 10 most frequently  cited papers in the complete 
network. This difference suggests greater involvement in the subclusters than in the B8 cluster. 
There are a greater number of points in the A5, A1, and A2 areas, which, according to Shibata et 
al (2011), indicates emerging technologies. The study by Zhao (1998), which is represented in 
Figure  7  by  the  pink  dotted  line,  begins  with  a  higher-than-average  frequency  of  citation.  The 
frequency  then  falls,  goes  up  again,  and  falls  again,  thus  coming  close  to  the  average  citation 
frequency. However, it is spread throughout many clusters, which suggests that the topic of the 
paper is related to enabling technologies. Meanwhile, the paper by Seachinger (2008) reveals the 
capacity of the methodology developed for identifying papers that are cited in a specific cluster. 
Though  they  are  frequently  cited,  they  do  not  overlap  into  other  clusters  because  the  topic  of 
study (in this case, bioenergy) is so specific. 

4. Conclusions 

This  paper  presents  a  methodological  effort  to  deal  with  a  data  base  of  papers  related  to 
bioenergy using key words without the definition of filters previously applied. The methodology 
allows to a dynamic view of the emergence of the clusters, what is very difficult to perform with 
classical  methodologies  to  obtain  timelines  (NOOY,MVAR.BATTLE,  2006;  SILVEIRA  et 
ALLI, 2013)). 
It is also able to deal with a big number of papers and huge networks. The results in Table 1 are 
quite intriguing: the main key words identified by lexicographic analysis had related the cluster 
B8, the emergent one, with human health, not with  bioenergy. The subsequent analysis of the 
content  of  the  paper  reveals  the  importance  of  papers  directly  related  to  bioenergy,  which 
motivated the application of the steps of the methodology to the cluster 8. 
The results allows to achieve a sub-cluster G4 clearly identified with the themes of bioenergy, an 
emergent  cluster  that  is  not  strongly  connected  with  the  other  3  sub-clusters.  Nanotechnology 
applied  to  sensors  and  engines  is  the  main  subject  of  the  other  three  sub-clusters,  indicating  a 
future convergence of technologies, which reinforces the original hypothesis of the paper about 
the emergent nature of bioenergy.
