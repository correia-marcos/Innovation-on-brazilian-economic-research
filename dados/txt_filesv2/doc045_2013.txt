Abstract  

 

We  analyze  inflation  persistence  in  several  industrial  and  emerging  countries  in  the 
recent past by implementing unit root tests in the presence of unknown structural breaks 
and  by  estimating  reduced-form  models  of  inflation  dynamics.  We  select  a  very 
representative group of 23 industrial and 17 emerging economies. Our sample period is 
comprised  of  quarterly  data  and  differs  for  each  country.  Our  results  indicate  that 
inflation  persistence  is  decreasing  over  time  for  the  great  majority  of  industrial 
economies.  Many  emerging  economies,  however,  show  increasing  persistence.  Even 
some,  such  as  Argentina,  Peru,  Bolivia,  Hungary  and  Check  Republic,  have  highly 
persistent  inflationary  processes.  We  also  observe  structural  breaks  in  all  inflation 
processes  we  study  with  the  exception  of  the  inflation  processes  of  Germany  and 
Austria. Our results are robust to different reduced forms of the inflation processes and 
different econometric techniques.

1 Introduction 

One  of  the  most  important  characteristics  of  the  dynamics  of  inflation  is  its  degree  of 
persistence. It is related to how quickly inflation reverts to its initial level after a shock. 
As Mishkin (2007) points out, if inflation is persistent, it increases the costs of monetary 
policy (in terms of product or unemployment) to keep inflation under control.2 
 
In  the  last  years,  both  industrial  and  emerging  economies  have  experienced  important 
changes  in  the  degree  of  their  inflationary  persistence.  As  Cechetti  et  al  (2007)  show 
both the volatility and level of inflation has decreased in industrial economies. In these 
economies,  the  decades  of  1960  and  1970  were  considered  periods  of  high  and 
persistent inflation, while the more recent decades, 1990 and 2000, have low levels of 
inflation as well as low persistence.  
 
Contrary  to  industrial  countries,  emerging  economies  have  experienced  high  levels  of 
inflations  for  a  longer  period.  Some  of  these  countries,  such  as  Brazil,  Argentina, 
Bolivia, Peru, Mexico, Israel, Poland and Turkey, have had periods of hyperinflation in 
the last thirty  years.3 Only recently, in the decade of 1990, the levels of inflation have 
started  to  decrease  in  these  countries.  This,  in  part,  is  due  to  the important  changes  in 
the conduct of their macroeconomic policies.4 However, it is not clear if the decrease of 
the  level  of  inflation  has  been  accompanied  by  a  reduction  of  their  inflationary 
persistence.      
 
Our objective in this paper is to analyze empirically the inflation persistence of several 
industrial  and  emerging  countries  in  the  recent  past.  We  select  a  very  representative 
group  of  23  industrial  and  17  emerging  economies.  We  want  to  answer  the  following 
questions: Has inflation persistence decreased and been stable for industrial economies? 
Has  it  decreased  and  been  stable  for  emerging  economies  that  had  and  had  not 
experienced hyperinflation in the recent past? 5678 

                                                 
2  In  a  more  formal  way,  we  can  define  inflation  persistence  as  the  propensity  of  inflation  to  converge 
slowly  towards  its  long  run  equilibrium  following  a  shock  that  has  taken  inflation  away  from  this 
equilibrium.  
3 To define a hyperinflation country, in the first place, we chose a sample of countries that had prolonged 
periods  of  inflation  over  15%  a  year.  Then  we  looked  at  the  recent  monetary  history  of  the  country, 
searched IMF country reports and anecdote facts about the country, so as to pinpoint a subsample of them 
that we believe experienced hyperinflation episodes.   
4  As  examples  of  some  macroeconomic  policies  we  can  list:  inflation  targeting  adoption,  reduction  of 
budget  deficits,  improvement  of  financial  regulation,  trade  liberalization  and  flexible  exchange  rate 
policies among others.  It is also important to add that for Latin American countries the renegotiation of 
the external debt was a pre-condition and basis for inflation stabilization, particularly in Brazil.   
5  Our  sample  of  emerging  economies  is  Argentina,  Brazil,  Bolivia,  Chile,  Colombia,  Czech  Republic, 
Hungary, Israel, Korea, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Slovak Republic, Thailand, and 
Turkey.   Our sample of industrial countries is:  Austria,  Australia, Belgium,  Canada, Denmark,  Finland, 
France,  Germany,  Greece,  Iceland,  Ireland,  Italy,  Japan,  Luxembourg,  Netherlands,  Norway,  New 
Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States. 
6 See Stock and Watson (2003) for a brief analysis of monetary policy in some industrial countries in the 
last years.   
7 Low persistence of inflation occurs when the parameter is significantly lower than 1. Stability means 
that the persistence parameter is stable in a statistical sense across different subsamples of our data.    
8 Various factors can explain persistence: persistence may be inherited from persistent fluctuations in the 
determinants  of  inflation,  like  marginal  cost  or  output  gap  (this  is  called  extrinsic  persistence);  the 
dependence  of  inflation  on  its  own  past,  also  called  intrinsic  persistence  and  persistence  due  to  the 
formation of inflation expectations. Each one of this persistence can be associated with one of the three 
terms of a new Keynesian Phillips curve.

Our results show that inflation persistence is decreasing over time for the great majority 
of  industrial  economies  in  our  sample.  Many  emerging  economies  in  our  sample, 
however,  show  increasing  persistence  over  time  and  even  some,  such  as  Argentina, 
Peru, Bolivia, Hungary and Check Republic, have very persistent inflationary processes. 
We  also  find  that,  with  the  exception  of  inflation  in  Germany  and  Austria,  all  others 
inflation  processes  present  structural  breaks,  which  indicates  that  they  have  not  been 
stable through time.  
 
To obtain our results, we first follow Perron et al (2009) and test for the presence of unit 
roots  in  the  inflation  processes  of  all  countries  in  our  sample,  taking  in  consideration 
possible unknown structural breaks in these series.   
 
For  the  countries  in  our  sample  period  for  which  we  reject  the  unit  root,  we  estimate 
several  reduced  models  of  inflation.9  The  following  types  of  models  are  estimated: 
models  with  lags  of  inflation  with  and  without  GDP  gap;  new  Keynesian  Phillips 
curves; and a model that is a reduced-form inflation dynamics of structural models that 
incorporates some form of wage rigidity in the spirit of Blanchard and Gali (2005).  
 
We use quarterly  data of inflation, GDP and unemployment for each of  our countries. 
The sample period for each country differs, depending of the availability of these data. 
For most countries, we have very long span of inflation data. For some we have almost 
50 years of quarterly data.10   
 
For  many  of  the  countries  we  consider,  substantial  shifts  in  monetary  policy  have 
occurred over the past two decades. In the case of European countries, the introduction 
of the Euro is a very important milestone.  In the case of emerging economies, we can 
cite  more  sound  macroeconomic  policies  including,  for  many  of  them,  the  choice  of 
inflation targeting as a framework for monetary policies.  
 
Our results, in general, confirm the results of a vast literature that shows that inflation 
persistence has been decreasing for industrial economies, such as: Dossche and Everaert 
(2005), Taylor (1999), Altissimo et al (2006), Benati (2008) and Batini (2002). 
 
Our paper contributes to the literature by looking at a greater and more diversified group 
of countries, including several emerging ones, by considering a more recent period and 
by estimating various inflation dynamics specifications, taking in consideration possible 
unknown structural breaks in these dynamics.11  
                                                 
9We also look at the inflations correlograms and decompose all inflation series in trend and cycle. Both 
analysis, in general terms, confirm the results we present in this paper.    
10 The following countries have inflation series starting at the second quarter of 1960: Australia, Canada, 
Finland, Greece, Luxembourg, France, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United 
States.  
11  Other  papers  look  at  how  inflation  persistence  has  evolved  over  time  also  estimating  reduced  form 
inflation processes. For example, Mishkin (2007) studies inflation persistence in the United States in the 
last 40 years, using auto regressive models and decomposing inflation in cycle and trend as in Stock and 
Watson  (2006).  Mishkin  confirms  the  results  of  Stock  and  Watson  (2006),  showing  that  inflation 
persistence is decreasing worldwide since the 1990s, compared with persistence observed in the 1960 and 
1970s.  Nason  (2006)  describes  the  dynamics  of  inflation  in  the  United  States  with  several  different 
models  of  inflation  and  confirms  the  results  of  Mishkin  (2007)  and  Stock  and  Watson  (2006)  that 
inflation persistence is decreasing in the United States in the last years. Rudd and Whelan (2005) estimate 
a  new  Keynesian  hybrid  Phillips  curve  with  lags  in  inflation  and  show  that  inflation  persistence  in  the 
United States is decreasing and is much more backward-looking than forward-looking. Fuhrer (2005) also

the empirical analysis. Section 4 concludes.  
2. Data 

Iceland, 

Our data are quarterly and differs depending on the country. We select 40 countries: 23 
industrial  and  17  emerging.  Our  data  source  is  the  International  Financial  Statistics  of 
the International Monetary Fund. Our measure of inflation is headline Consumer Price 
Index inflation, CPI. We use as exogenous the following variables: the GDP gap, which 
is the difference between nominal GDP and potential GDP obtained through  Hodrick-
Prescott filtering and the unemployment rate. 
 
For  the  purpose  of  our  analysis,  we  separate  our  sample  of  countries  in  three  groups: 
one  group  is  comprised  of  industrial  countries  (Austria,  Australia,  Belgium,  Canada, 
Denmark,  Finland,  France,  Germany,  Greece, 
Ireland,  Italy,  Japan, 
Luxembourg,  Netherlands,  Norway,  New  Zealand,  Portugal,  Spain,  Sweden, 
Switzerland,  United  Kingdom  and  United  States),  emerging  countries  that  did  not 
experienced  “hyperinflation”  in  the  recent  past  (Chile,  Colombia,  Czech  Republic, 
Hungary,  Korea,  Philippines,  South  Africa,  Slovak  Republic  and  Thailand),  and 
emerging  economies  that  have  had  hyperinflation  recently  in  our  view,  such  as 
Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico, Turkey, Israel and Poland.   
 
Table  1  Panel  A  shows  the  sample  periods  for  the  inflation  series  of  all  countries  we 
analyze. For several of them, the sample period starts at the second quarter of 1960. The 
countries  in  which  the  samples  periods  are  lower  are  lower  are  Czech  Republic  and 
Slovak Republic, in which the data starts at the second quarter of 1993.  
Table 1 Panel B shows the sample periods for the GDP of all countries in our sample. 
For most countries, the series of GDP are much smaller than the series of inflation.  In 
the case of unemployment, as Table 1 Panel C shows the sample are even much shorter 
than  both  the  samples  of  inflation  and  GDP  for  almost  all  countries  except  for  the 
United States, where the series starts in the first quarter of 1960.   
 
In Table 2, we present descriptive statistics of the inflation processes. Table 2 Panel A 1 
shows  that  average  quarterly  inflation  in  industrial  economies  is  1.24%  and  that  the 
average standard deviation is 1.30%. The country  with the highest average inflation is 
Portugal, 2.42%, and with the highest standard deviation is Iceland with 2.89%.  
 
Table  2  Panel  B  shows  descriptive  statistics  of  inflation  for  the  group  of  emerging 
economies that did not have hyperinflation episode in the last thirty years. One can see 
that average inflation is 2.08% and average standard deviation is 2.07%. The economy 
with  the  highest  average  inflation  is  Colombia,  3.67%,  and  with  the  highest  standard 
deviation is Hungary, 2.85%. 
 
Table  2  Panel  C  shows  descriptive  statistics  of  inflation  for  the  group  of  emerging 
economies that experienced a hyperinflation episode in the last thirty years. We can see 
that  average  inflation  is  10.45%  and  average  standard  deviation  is  20.72%.  The 

                                                                                                                                               
models  inflation  using  a  hybrid  Keynesian  Phillips  curve.  He  separates  persistence  in  two  types:  one 
related  to  the  dynamics  of  the  output  gap  and  the  other  to  marginal  cost  and  that  depends  on  lags  of 
inflation. Fuhrer shows that the more relevant part of inflation in the last years is due to intrinsic inflation 
and not to output gap.

economy  with  the  highest  average  inflation  and  standard  deviation  is  Brazil,  23.78%, 
and 35.88% respectively.  
 
It is clear from Table 2 Panel B that inflation is higher in emerging economies that have 
had hyperinflation in the recent past. The average inflation in these economies is 9.03% 
higher than average inflation in the industrial economies and 8.37% higher than average 
inflation in emerging economies that did not have hyperinflation. Not only the average 
inflation,  but  also  volatility  is  much  higher  in  the  emerging  with  hyperinflation  when 
compared with the other economies in our sample.  
 
In the next section, we will present our empirical analysis of inflation persistence based 
on  unit  root  tests  in  the  presence  of  unknown  structural  breaks  and  the  estimation  of 
reduced form inflation dynamics for the groups of countries in our sample.    
3. Empirical Analysis 

3.1 Unit Root Tests 

The overall degree of inflation persistence can be measured in several ways. The results 
reported  in  this  section  are  based  on  the  methods  that  are  most  frequently  used  in  the 
literature.  In  order  to  show  how  fast  inflation  returns  back  to  its  mean  following  a 
disturbance,  or  its  persistence,  we  measure  the  dependence  of  inflation  on  its  past 
values. 
 
As it is well known, a process that has a unit root is a highly persistent one. To verify if 
any of our inflation processes has a unit root and structural breaks, we follow two steps. 
In  the  first  step,  we  test  for  the  presence  of  a  unit  root  with  Aumengted  Dick  Fueller, 
ADF  tests,  and  for  the  presence  of  structural  breaks  with  Quandt-Andrews  and 
Andrews-Ploberg (1994).12 Only in the case of the inflation processes of Germany and 
Austria, we reject the null of a unit root as well as the presence of structural breaks.13 
 
In the second step, following Perron (2009) we test for the presence of a unit root in the 
presence of unknown structural breaks for all inflation processes with the exception of 
Germany and Austria. Perron allows for the possibility of an unknown structural break 
both for the Hypotheses  of a unit root process, the null Hypotheses, as well as for the 
Hypotheses of stationary process, the alternative Hypotheses.  
 
 In all our tests, we consider the possibility of an unknown structural break both at the 
intercept and  at the trend. To allow for the possibility of various structural breaks,  we 
use rolling samples.  
 
Table 3 presents the results. In the case of some emerging economies- Argentina, Peru, 
Bolivia, Hungary and Check Republic - we accept the null hypothesis of a unit root in 
the  presence  of  unknown  structural  breaks.  For  all  other  inflation  processes,  we  reject 
the null.  
3.2 Auto Regressive Processes 
 
For  all  other  inflation  dynamics  in  which  we  reject  the  unit  root  in  the  presence  of 
unknown  structural  breaks,  we  estimate  reduced  form  specifications.  We  will  explore 

                                                 
12 We use the trimmings 10%, 15%, 25% and  35% for the Quandt-Andrews and Andrews-Ploberg tests.  
13 In the case of Austria, the p-value of the ADF test is 0.083 and in the case of Germany the p-value of 
the ADF is 0.00.

several  possibilities.  They 
specifications of new Keynesian Phillips curves.  
 
One  these  possibilities,  which  is  one  of  the  most  obvious  way  of  measuring  inflation 
persistence  is  to  regress  inflation  on  several  of  its  lags  as  in  equation  (1)  and  then 
calculate the sum of coefficients on lagged inflation. If the sum of coefficients is close 
to 1, then shocks to inflation have long lived effects on inflation. The higher the sum of 
the  coefficients  of  inflation  lags,  the  longer  it  takes  for  inflation  to  return  back  to  its 
mean, or the more persistent is the inflationary process.

tπ  is headline consumer inflation. 

To the extent that lagged inflation captures true persistence in the price setting process 
the model implies that rapid reductions of inflation can only be produced at the cost of 
substantial  increase  in  unemployment  or  decrease  in  product.  Hence,  the  model  points 
to  a  gradualist  approach  as  providing  the  best  way  to  effect  a  large  reduction  in 
inflation.  
 
An  equivalent  approach  for  analyzing  persistence  (and  the  one  we  will  follow  in  this 
paper) is to estimate ρ in equation (2) as Reilly and Whelan (2005) show.

There are a number of good reasons for focusing on ρ as our main measure of inflation 
persistence.  For  example,  in  this  model,  ρ  is  a  crucial  determinant  of  the  response  to 
shocks over time. It can also be shown that 1/(1-ρ) gives the infinite-horizon cumulative 
impulse response to shocks.  
 

In equation (2), we also use as regressors level dummies and dummies interacting with 
the  first  lag  of  the  inflation  process.14  The  dummies  for  most  countries  indicate 
structural breaks that we observe with the Perron (2009) unit root tests. However for a 
few countries the dummies of structural breaks are found using Quandt-Andrews  with 
rolling samples.15  
 

                                                 
14 Dummies are represented by d and D is to total of dummies indicating a structural break that varies 
depending on each country.  
15 The countries for which we include other dummies indicating other structural breaks different from 
those that we obtain with Perron (2009)  are: Chile, Israel, Mexico and Netherlands. We analyse the 
inflation process of these countries graphically and also look at possible economic reasons for a break and 
consider that for these countries the break Perron found are  not structural in nature. So we use quandt-
Quandt to find other breaks that we think make more sense in economic terms.

We choose the number  of lags of first difference of headline  consumer inflation in (2) 
so  as  the  residuals  do  not  present  serial  correlation,  using  LM  test  to  identify  serial 
correlation. We also check for heteroskedasticity with White and Breush-Pagan. If there 
is evidence of heteroskedasticity, we correct it with the Newey-West robust errors. We 
do a Wald test of ρ=1 for all estimations of the traditional models and we rejected ρ=1 
for all estimations.  
 
Table  4  Panel  A  shows  the  estimated  ρ  for  this  specification  for  industrial  economies 
including the dummies of structural breaks. The  majority of industrial countries (78%) 
show decreasing persistence over time, as one can see.16 For all industrial countries, we 
reject the null hyphoteses of sum of the persistence coefficients equal to one.  
 
Tabel 4 Panel B shows the estimation of equation (2) for emerging economies. As one 
can see, some countries like Chile, Israel, Mexico, Poland, Turkey and Slovak Republic 
show increasing persistence. Of these, Turkey and Poland are hyperinflation countries. 
The  other  hyperinflation  countries  show  decreasing  persistence.  This  is  the  case  of 
Brazil for instance.17Once more, we reject the null hypotheses of sum of the persistence 
coefficients equal to one.  
 
We  repeat  the  estimation  above  including  in  equation  (2)  the  output  gap  calculated 
using  Hodrick-Prescot  filter.  Again,  we  test  for  serial  correlation,  heteroskedasticity, 
and in their presence we correct using Newey-West.   
 
The  results  for  the  industrial  economies  are  very  similar  to  the  ones  described  above 
(see  Table  5  Panel  A).  However  for  emerging  economies,  the  results  differ  somewhat 
from  the  previous  ones.  No  emerging  economy  presents  increasing  persistence.  We 
think  that  this  result  has  to  do  with  fact  that  our  series  of  GDP  for  each  country  is 
shorter  than  the  series  of  inflation  for  most  countries  in  our  sample,  particularly  for 
emerging  ones.  Therefore,  we  believe  that  the  results  that  we  present  in  Table  4  are 
more representative of the inflation dynamics of these emerging economies.  
 
To  capture  if  monetary  policy  has  anchored  inflation  expectations  more  solidly  in  the 
last  years,  that  could  have  important  implication  to  inflation  persistence  we  will 
estimate  in  the  following  section  new  Keynesian  models  of  inflation  that  incorporate 
inflation expectations.    
 

3.3 New Keynesian Phillips Curves Estimation   

The  most  important  implication  of  the  pure  new  Keynesian  model  of  inflation  is  that 
there  is  no  intrinsic  persistence  in  inflation  in  the  sense  that  there  is  no  structural 
dependence  of  inflation  on  its  own  lagged  values.  Instead,  inflation  is  determined  in  a 
completely  forward-looking  manner.  One  implication  of  this  model  in  contrast  to 
traditional ones is that it is much easier to quickly reduce inflation in this model than in 

                                                 
16 This can be observed by the looking at the sum of the persistent coefficients alone and interacting with 
dummies of structural breaks.  
17 We compare the average of persistence coefficient of the three groups by doing Wald tests in a system 
of equations estimated with OLS in which each equation is the same one we estimated individually.

the  traditional  one.  In  fact,  according  to  the  new  Keynesian  model,  inflation  can  be 
costless controlled by a credible commitment to keep output close to its potential. 18 
 
Due  to  the  difficulty  of  fitting  the  data  with  new  Keynesian  pure  forward-looking 
model, a vast literature that incorporates lags of inflation in the new Keynesian Phillips 
curve  (NKPC)  has  emerged19.  For  many,  this  class  of  models  represents  a  sort  of 
common-sense  middle  ground  that  preserves  the  insights  of  standard  rational 
expectations  models  while  allowing  for  better  empirical  fit  by  dealing  directly  with  a 
well known deficiency of the pure forward looking model of inflation. As a result this 
class of models has been widely used in applied monetary policy analysis.  
 
The  structural  equation  for  inflation  that  we  estimate  is  in  the  spirit  of  hybrid  new 
Keynesian  Phillips  curve  as  in  (3).  These  models  add  a  dependence  of  inflation  on  its 
lagged  values  to  otherwise  purely  forward  looking  models.  Such  models  are  often 
considered as a compromise between the need for rigorous micro foundations of the sort 
underlying  the  pure  new-Keynesian  Phillips  curve  and  the  need  to  fit  the  data 
empirically.

where ht is output gap and Xt is foreign exchange rate.  

 

The  parameter  that  measures  inflation  persistence  isρ.  Again,  we  interact  this 

parameter  with  dummies  indicating  structural  breaks  (d  are  the  dummies  and  D  is  the 

total number of dummies).  

 
We use two different instruments for the expectation of inflation one period ahead. One 
instrument  is  the  lag  of  current  inflation.  The  other  instrument  is  the  residual  of  the 
inflation equation of a VAR with inflation and GDP gap as dependent variables. In this 
case, the number of lags is chosen using Akaike information criteria.  
 
We also check for serial correlation with LM test and for heteroskedasticity with White 
test. In the presence of serial correlation, we include more lags of regressors, until there 
is  no  more  evidence  of  serial  correlation.  In  the  presence  of  heteroskedasticity,  we 
corrected with Newey-West robust matrix.  

                                                 
18  The  most  popular  formulation  of  the  new  Keynesian  framework  is  based  on  Calvo  (1983)  model  of 
price  random  adjustment.  The  model  assumes  that  in  each  period  a  random  fraction  of  firms  reset  their 
price while all other firms keep their prices unchanged. Calvo assumes an imperfectly competitive market 
structure as well. These two hypotheses generate the basic new Keynesian model of inflation.  
19 See Fuhrer and Moore (1995), Gali and Gertler (1999) and Christiano et al (2005) for some theoretical 
models that justify the inclusion of lags of inflation in the new Keynesian Phillips curves.

Table 6 Panels A and B shows the estimated persistence with the lag of current inflation 
as an instrument for industrial and emerging economies respectively. Table 6 Panels C 
and D shows the estimated persistence with the residuals of the inflation equation of the 
VAR as instruments.  
 
The results for estimations with both instruments are somewhat different from the ones 
we  find  before.  Very  few  industrial  economies  have  the  sum  of  the  persistent 
significant.  For  those  that  are  significant,  we  observe  a  decrease  in  persistence.  In  the 
case  of  emerging  economies,  the  results  are  mixed.  Some  of  these  countries  show 
significant and increasing persistence while others have decreasing persistence. Again, 
these  results  may  be  related  to  the  very  different  sample  periods  of  GDP  data  for  all 
countries, particularly for emerging ones.   
 
After gauging all the empirical evidence that we present above- considering several unit 
root tests with unknown  structural breaks  and the estimation of reduced form inflation 
dynamics-  we  ponder  that  in  general  terms,  our  results  show  that  most  industrial 
economies  experience  decreasing  persistence  over  time,  while  in  the  case  of  emerging 
economies some show deceasing, others show increasing and even some present highly 
persistent inflationary processes.  
 
In  terms  of  macroeconomic  policies,  we  think  that  these  results  are  important  for 
emerging economies. Despite some recent improvements in macroeconomic policies in 
some  of  these  countries,  inflation  persistence  is  still  an  important  issue  for  them.  This 
means  that  macroeconomic  policies  should  continue  to  focus  in  targeting  both  low 
levels  and  low  volatilities  of  inflation  in  these  countries  to  diminish  the  importance  of 
inflation persistence in the next years.  
 
4. Conclusion  

We  analyze  inflation  persistence  in  several  industrial  and  emerging  countries  in  the 
recent  past  by  implementing  unit  root  tests  in  the  presence  of  structural  breaks  and  by 
estimating reduced-form models of inflation dynamics. We select a very representative 
group of 23 industrial and 17 emerging economies. 
 
Our  results  show  that  inflation  persistence  is  mostly  decreasing  over  time  for  the 
industrial economies. Many emerging economies, however, show increasing persistence 
over  time  and  even  some,  such  as  Argentina,  Peru,  Bolivia,  Hungary  and  Check 
Republic, have very persistent inflationary processes. We also find that all inflationary 
processes  present  structural  breaks  in  their  sample  periods,  which  indicates  that  they 
have not been stable.  
 
In interpreting our results, we must first recognize that all of them are based on reduced-
from  relationships.  Thus,  they  are  about  correlations  and  not  necessarily  about  true 
structural  relationships.  Explanatory  variables 
inflation  estimations  are 
themselves  influenced  by  changes  in  economic  conditions.  So,  changes  in  the 
underlying  monetary  policy  regime  are  likely  to  be  a  source  changes  in  reduced-form 
inflation dynamics. This problem is especially acute for structural relationship involving 
expectations or other factors that are not directly observable and so cannot be included 
in reduced form regressions. In such cases, we cannot use the reduced form equations to 

in  our 

 

9 

disentangle the effects of such unobserved factors which themselves may be driven by 
changes in monetary policy from that of other influences.  
 
Mishkin  (2007)  makes  it  clear  that  inflation  expectations  must  be  a  key  driving  force 
behind  inflation.  This  dependence  has  long  been  implicit  in  traditional  Phillips  curve 
analysis  but  now  expectations  are  explicit  and  are  also  a  central  feature  of  new 
Keynesian Phillips curves in which current period inflation is a function of expectations 
next period and output gap.  
 
Anchoring of inflation expectations must be related to monetary policy. During the past 
years  several  central  banks  have  increased  their  commitment  to  price  stability  in  both 
words  and  action.  The  Federal  Reserve,  the  European  Central  Bank  and  other  central 
banks  of  industrial  and  some  of  emerging  economies  have  been  committed  to  keep 
inflation under control.  
 
For  many  emerging  economies,  however,  our  empirical  evidence  indicates  that 
anchoring  of  inflation  expectations  is  problematic  still  because  of  high  inflation 
persistence  that  we  observe  in  these  economies.  The  increase  of  monetary  policy 
effectiveness  in  these  countries  thus  is  related  to  the  capacity  their  central  banks  will 
have to decrease inflation persistence in the next years.

Our data are quarterly and differs depending on the country. We select 40 countries: 23 
industrial  and  17  emerging.  Our  data  source  is  the  International  Financial  Statistics  of 
the  International Monetary Fund. Our measure of inflation is headline Consumer Price 
Index inflation, CPI. Panel A presents the results of the estimation of equation (2) in the 
text for industrial economies. Panel B presents the results of the estimation of equation 
(2)  in  the  text  for  emerging  economies.  Below  the  estimated  persistent  coefficients  in 
columns  1  to  3  of  both panels  A  and  B,  we  have  a  t  statistic.  In  the  last  2  columns  of 
both Panels A and B, we have p-values.

Table 5 Autoregressive Processes Estimation with Output Gap 

Our data are quarterly and differs depending on the country. We select 40 countries: 23 
industrial  and  17  emerging.  Our  data  source  is  the  International  Financial  Statistics  of 
the  International Monetary Fund. Our measure of inflation is headline Consumer Price 
Index inflation, CPI. We use as exogenous the following variables: the GDP gap, which 
is  the  difference  between  nominal  GDP  and  potential  GDP  obtained  through  Hodrick-
Prescott  filtering  and  the  unemployment  rate.  Panel  A  presents  the  results  of  the 
estimation  of  equation  (2)  in  the  text  for  industrial  economies  with  the  inclusion  of 
output gap. Panel B presents the results of the estimation of equation (3) in the text for 
emerging  economies  with  the  inclusion  of  output  gap.  Below  the  estimated  persistent 
coefficients in columns 1 to 3 of both panels A and B, we have a t statistic. In the last 2 
columns of both Panels A and B, we have p-values.

Table 6 New Keynesian Phillips Curves Estimations  

Our data are quarterly and differs depending on the country. We select 40 countries: 23 
industrial  and  17  emerging.  Our  data  source  is  the  International  Financial  Statistics  of 
the  International Monetary Fund. Our measure of inflation is headline Consumer Price 
Index inflation, CPI. We use as exogenous the following variables: the GDP gap, which 
is  the  difference  between  nominal  GDP  and  potential  GDP  obtained  through  Hodrick-
Prescott  filtering  and  the  unemployment  rate.  Panel  A  presents  the  results  of  the 
estimation  of  equation  (3)  in  the  text  for  industrial  economies  using  the  first  lag  of 
inflation as an instrument. Panel B presents the results of the estimation of equation (3) 
in  the  text  for  emerging  economies  using  the  first  lag  of  inflation  as  an  instrument. 
Panel  C  presents  the  results  of  the  estimation  of  equation  (3)  in  the  text  for  industrial 
economies  using  the  residual  of  an  inflation  equation  of  a  VAR  that  also  includes  a 
GDP  equation  as  an  instrument.  Panel  D  presents  the  results  of  the  estimation  of 
equation  (3)  in  the  text  for  emerging  economies  using  the  residual  of  an  inflation 
equation  of  a  VAR  that  also  includes  a  GDP  equation  as  an  instrument.  Below  the 
estimated persistent coefficients in columns 1 to 3 of A, B, C and D we have a t statistic. 
In the last 2 columns of Panels A, B, C and D we have p-values.
