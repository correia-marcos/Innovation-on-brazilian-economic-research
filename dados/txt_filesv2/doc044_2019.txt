Resumo

O principal objetivo deste artigo é investigar a interação entre a credibilidade fiscal e a trajetória
da inflação acumulada Brasileira, considerando o regime de metas. Utilizando regressões quan-
tilicas e estimando as densidades condicionais, encontramos que uma melhora na credibilidade
fiscal pode reduzir em até 35% a probabilidade de que a inflação não feche o mês dentro dos
limites do regime de metas. Além disso, existem situações nas quais, apos um longo período
de estabilidade, a melhora na credibilidade fiscal pode levar a um aumento na probabilidade
de que a inflação acumulada viole os limites estipulados. Logo, ressaltamos a necessidade de
parcimônia na execução de politicas econômicas baseadas somente em estimativas médias.

Abstract

The main objective of this paper is to investigate the interaction between fiscal credibility
and the trajectory of Brazilian accumulated inflation, considering the target regime. Using
quantile regressions and estimating conditional densities, we find that an improvement in fiscal
credibility can reduce the probability that inflation does not close the month within the limits
of the target regime by up to 35%. In addition, there are situations where, after a long period of
stability, improved fiscal credibility may lead to an increase in the likelihood that accumulated
inflation will violate the stipulated limits. Therefore, we emphasize the need for parsimony in
the execution of economic policies based on average estimates.

Key-words: Fiscal Credibility; Quantile Regression; Inflation Target.

1 Introduction

The inflation targeting regime is adopted by the central bank of several nations, including
those in development. Historically, New Zealand, in 1990, was the first to adopt the inflation target
regime, shortly after, the adoption by Canada, in 1991, followed by the United Kingdom in 1992,
Sweden and Finland in 1993, and Israel, Australia and Chile in 1994. In Brazil, the adoption was
later, precisely in the year 1999. The adoption of this regime aims to stabilize the prices, making the
agent’s expectations to converge to the inflation target.

According to Johnson (2002) and Johnson (2003) the adoption of inflation targets by indus-
trialized countries has reduced the expected inflation level of these countries. Similar results were
found in Bernanke et al. (1999), Vega e Winkelried (2005), Mishkin e Schmidt-Hebbel (2007) and
Gonçalves e Salles (2008).

Due to the fundamental role that public expectations play in this regime, reputation and cred-
ibility have become indispensable instruments for the success (Mendonca (2007)). These monetary
policy instrument seeks to keep inflation low, as well as to act as an anchor in the expectation forma-
tion process (Levin et al. (2004)). Therefore, the way in which monetary policy is to be implemented
depends directly on the credibility of the monetary authority.

Thus, the greater the credibility of the central bank, the lower the movements required in the
interest rate to control the price level and, indirectly, the lower the reaction movements of the real
aggregates (Neuenkirch e Tillmann (2014)).

However, even if monetary credibility is a necessary condition for controlling prices, it is pre-
ceded by fiscal stability and sustainability of public debt. Nonetheless, until then, the emphasis of the
expectation approach was being given only to monetary policy. According to Cespedes e Gali (2013),
developments in fiscal policy around the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 (subprime crisis) are
undoubtedly an important fact for Fiscal policy to enter again in the literature of policies Economic.
From the subprime crisis, developing and developed countries, with the aim of exiting the
crisis, begin to use fiscal and monetary expansionist policy. However, as an inheritance of this policy
arrangement, countries such as Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain began to see their public
debt/GDP ratio rise and began to worry about fiscal policy and the risk of debt default.

The effects of the fiscal policy on inflation and the GDP gap began to be studied by several
authors. Benigno e Woodford (2003), Kirsanova et al. (2007), Gali (2008), Çebi (2012) are examples
of some studies that investigated the interaction of fiscal and monetary policies. The results show
that fiscal policy and its interaction with monetary policy are decisive in the trajectory of inflation,
GDP gap and the relationship of GDP debt. According to Nunes e Portugal (2009), the lack of
coordination between monetary and fiscal policies should be considered a factor that can trigger or
intensify a conjuncture of economic instability. Besides, in the limit, monetary policy may not have
any effect on inflation if there is no sustainable fiscal policy. That is because, an undisciplined tax
policy can exert pressure on the monetary authority sooner or later, monetize the debt, incurring an
increase in future inflation (Sargent e Wallace (1981)).

Dealing with domestic price dynamics, the Brazilian economy experienced periods of hyper-
inflation in recent history, often reaching three digits in the 1980s. But since the 1990s, after the
implementation of Plano Real in 1994, the price index returned to stability with an average value
of 6.45 % p.p., from 1996 to 2014. However, with the external crisis, instability of public accounts,
pressure on the exchange rate and growth of uncertainty, the deviation of the price level has returned
to attention in recent quarters. The Extended Consumer Price Index (IPCA), for example, reached
double digits in 2015, an unusual event since 2002.

Thus, in the brazilian economy recent period, high inflation, high interest rate and explosive
trajectory of public debt resulted in loss of monetary and fiscal credibility. These facts justifies
the study of the effects of fiscal credibility on brazilian’s inflation rates considering an inflation
target regime. The aims of this paper is to assess the implication of fiscal credibility and answer

2

the following question: How does an increase in fiscal credibility affect the probability of accumulated
inflation remaining within the target?. For this, we use an instrumental quantile regression model
and estimate the conditional density functions to obtain the probabilities.

Our results indicate that the main source of asymmetry is the fiscal credibility index, which
presents positive coefficients in the lower quantile of inflation and negative in the upper ones. Fur-
thermore, we find evidence that an improvement in the fiscal credibility index can, in most cases,
induce a reduction of up to 35% in the probability that cumulative inflation is out of target. This is
corroborated by the robustness tests performed.

However, estimations indicate that after long periods of stability improvements in fiscal cred-
ibility could increase the likelihood that cumulative inflation will close outside the inflation target.
We believe that this distortion occurs through the channel of expectations, since agents can asso-
ciate this behavior with a future discretionary monetary policy. Finally, we reinforce the relevance of
parsimony in the execution of economic policies that don’t consider heterogeneity cycles in monetary
variables.

2 Literature review

There is a reasonable number of studies in the literature dealing with optimal fiscal policies,
such as Monacelli e Perotti (2008), Gali et al. (2007), among others. However, this literature has
been considered in isolation, subtracting the effects of monetary policy. Nevertheless, as pointed out
in the previous sections, the modern macroeconomics says that both fiscal and monetary policies are
not independent and put a relevant burden on fiscal policy, which influences and can even undermine
monetary policy, through the risk of monetization of debt by increasing future inflation and interest
rate.

Therefore, it is necessary to have good public debt management, in order to avoid the default,
and a good credibility in fiscal policy, since the market expectation influences the demand for bonds,
and therefore in the capacity of of the government to deal with the debt. In other words, fiscal
credibility is directly related to the sustainability of public debt (Mendonca e Machado (2013)). The
fiscal entity is regarded as credible if economic agents have confidence in government plans to avoid
the risk of public debt default. According to Kopits (2000), fiscal credibility is developed through
well-defined rules and structural reforms, which guarantee the sustainability of public debt.

In order to measure the fiscal credibility of the government, and following the line adopted in
by Mendonca (2007) related to monetary policy credibility, Mendonca e Machado (2013) introduces
the fiscal credibility index. This index is based on market expectations regarding the public debt
with respect to GDP and is described by the equation below.

1 𝑖𝑓 𝐸𝑡(𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑡+12) ≤ 𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑀 𝑖𝑛

𝑖𝑓 𝐸𝑡(𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑡+12) < 𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑀 𝑎𝑥

(1)

Equation 1 shows that the fiscal credibility index ICF is equals 1 if the expectations of the
debt-to-GDP ratio, 12 months ahead, is less than or equal to the minimum limit, 𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑀 𝑖𝑛 defined by
the Maastricht Treaty (regarded as a reference point by the IMF – International Monetary Fund).
However, if these expectations are greater than or equal to the maximum limit 𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑀 𝑎𝑥, also defined
by the above mentioned Treaty, the fiscal credibility index is null. It is noteworthy that the fluctuation

3

band is defined by the difference between 𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑀 𝑎𝑥 and 𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑀 𝑖𝑛. If the expectations of the debt-to-
GDP ratio are within this range, the Mendonca e Machado (2013) presents values between zero and
1.

The authors present empirical evidence for Brazil on the structure Debt and the effects of
this structure on the ratio of debt to GDP. As a result, Mendonca e Machado (2013) finds that
the commitment to public debt increases fiscal credibility, which is crucial for debt management.
Another result says that an increase in the average maturity of the participation of bonds linked to
inflation increases the risk of default (increase in the debt ratio with respect to GDP), a result that
goes against what is verified by the standard literature. And an increase in the share of securities
linked to the exchange rate decreases the debt-to-GDP ratio. Leaving as a main message that an
efficient management of public debt, able to ensure the sustainability of public debt, demands that
the government seeks to control inflation, stabilize the exchange rate and implement the policy of
fiscal credibility.

King (1995) stresses that low fiscal credibility implies a higher interest rate. A way proposed
by Dominguez (2005) to reduce the interest rate arising from the low credibility of the Government
would be the adoption of an optical strategy to reduce the maturity of the public debt.

With regard to inflation, there is a channel of interaction between fiscal and monetary policy,
since, according to Mishkin e Savastano (2001) the monetization risk of public debt is relevant in
environments of inflation targets because it can initiate an inflationary process . Moreover, this
interaction can be extended to fiscal and monetary credibility, since, as mentioned by Mendonca e
Hauel (2016), an improvement in monetary credibility means that the expectations of the agents
are well anchored and the consequence of this is a reduction in the interest rate, which in turn
contributes to stabilizing or reducing public debt. This reduction in debt can be interpreted as a
process of gaining tax credibility.

Demirel (2012) works on the effects of monetary credibility on imperfect fiscal credibility,
through a New-Keynesian model of a closed economy with government. The author found that an
improvement in the capacity of fiscal commitment, that is, improvement in fiscal credibility, induces
more soft monetary policy responses, after a mark-up shock. In addition, when analyzing the response
of an improvement in the capacity of fiscal commitment with a monetary policy under commitment,
he finds that the response is very similar, compared to monetary policy under discretion, giving the
understanding that the gains in the stabilization of monetary policy under commitment disappear
as fiscal commitment increases.

Mendonca e Hauel (2016) investigate the effects of fiscal and monetary credibility on public
debt, considering emerging economies under the inflation targets regime. The empirical work is is
built considering the Brazilian economy, an economy that is still in the process of creating monetary
and fiscal credibility. Using a GMM model, the authors finds that credibility contributes to improving
the management of public debt under a regime of inflation targets, as well as reducing costs related
to the increase in the average maturity of debt and the increase in the share of inflation-indexed
securities.

Lemoine e Linde (2016) examine the effects of budgetary consolidation based on expenditure
when the credibility with respect to cuts in spending are long-lasting is imperfect. Through a DSGE
model, for an open economy and calibrated for European countries, the authors find two main
results: First, under an independent monetary policy, the adverse impact of limited credibility is
small, and consolidation is expected to reduce public debt to a relatively low production cost, since
monetary policy offers more accommodation under perfect credibility. Second, the lack of monetary
accommodation under membership in monetary union implies that the cost of production can be
significantly higher, and that progress to reduce government debt in the short and medium term may
be limited under credibility imperfections.

Hu e Zaragaza (2018) use a DSGE model to analyze the impact of fiscal credibility on the real
variables of the economy in two scenarios, one of high credibility and the other of low credibility.

4

The authors find that different degrees of credibility have a significant quantitative impact on the
macroeconomic variables. In particular, according to the model, fully reliable spending cuts can
reduce 0.7% compared to production growth, while unreliable cuts induce a more limited production
response.

3 Methodology and Data

We can define a quantile 𝜏 as the value 𝑞, such that 100𝜏% of the sample values are less than 𝑞,
with 0 < 𝜏 < 1. This definition can be stated using the cumulative distribution of a random variable
𝑋:

𝐹(𝑥) = 𝑃(𝑋 ≤ 𝑥)

(2)

If we use the inverse function of the cumulative distribution above, at point 𝜏, we have that

the quantil 𝜏 of the random variable 𝑋 is:

𝐹 −1(𝜏) = 𝑖𝑛𝑓{𝑥 : 𝐹(𝑥) ≥ 𝜏}

(3)

Then, the inverse function gives us the quantile value for the probability chosen from the

infimum of those with a probabilistic sum greater than or equal to the quantile.

The Quantile Regressions (QR) method was introduced by Koenker e Bassett (1978). From this
analysis, the researcher can estimate the relationship between a set of explanatory variables 𝑥 and
the 𝜏 quantile of the dependent variable 𝑦. Unlike the OLS models that are estimated on the mean of
the response variable distribution, this approach is a useful technique because it allows us to study
the effect of an explanatory variable at various quantiles of the dependent 𝑦𝑡. In other words, the
QR models are able to incorporate heteroscedasticity, since they allow us to verify if the coefficients
of the explanatory variables change significantly (statistically) at different points of the dependent
variable distribution.

Considering a vector of continuous response variables 𝑦 = (𝑦1, 𝑦2, ...𝑦𝑡) and another vector of
explanatory 𝑥 = (𝑥1𝑖, 𝑥2𝑖, ..., 𝑥𝑘𝑖) , with subscript 𝑖 representing the series within the same variable,
𝑖 = (1, 2, ...𝑡). A standard linear regression model can be written as 𝐸(𝑦|𝑥) = 𝑥
𝛽, such that 𝛽 is a
vector of 𝑘 parameters.

Now a quantile regression model can be understood as 𝑄𝑦(𝜏|𝑥) = 𝑥

𝛽(𝜏), such that 𝛽(𝜏) is
a matrix with dimensions of 𝑘 parameters by 𝜏 quantiles, representing the effects of explanatory
variables at various points of 𝑦. The regression parameters 𝛽(𝜏) are conditionated to the 𝜏-quantile
and estimates can be obtained by the solution below:

′

′

𝑡∑︁

𝑖=1

Given 𝜌𝜏 as a linear loss function:

𝜌𝜏(𝑢) =

{︃

𝜏 𝑢, 𝑢 ≥ 0
(𝜏 − 1)𝑢, 𝑢 < 0

(6)

This non-differentiable function requires linear programming methods for their minimization.

This problem can be summarized in:

𝜏 𝑈 + (1 − 𝜏)𝑉

min
𝛽(𝜏)∈𝑅

s.a. 𝑌 = 𝛽(𝜏)𝑋 + 𝑈 − 𝑉

(7)

(8)

The error vector 𝑢 is composed of 𝑈 and 𝑉 . These terms represent the positive and negative parts
of the regression residuals, respectively. Two approaches are commonly used in the solution of this
problem: the Simplex method for moderate-size samples or the Interior Point method for larger
databases, both guarantee a solution with finite number of iterations.

Finally, the construction of the confidence intervals is performed by the moving blocks bootstrap
standard errors, which are more commonly used than the standard analytical errors 1. The moving
blocks bootstrap methodology is preferable since it makes no assumption about the distribution of
the response variable, being able to generalize the (QR) results and estimate the intervals in any case
of residual distribution and provides heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation robust standard errors.
In order to investigate the possible asymmetry in response variable distributions, we estimate

the conditional quantile density function 𝑓(𝐹 −1(𝜏)) according to Koenker e Xiao (2004):

𝑓𝑛(𝐹 −1

𝑛 (𝑡)) =

2ℎ𝑛

𝑛 (𝑡 + ℎ𝑛) − 𝐹 −1
𝐹 −1

𝑛 (𝑡 − ℎ𝑛)

(9)

where the function 𝐹 −1

𝑛 (𝑠) is an estimate of 𝐹 −1(𝑠) and ℎ𝑛 is a bandwidth. Here, we obtain

𝐹 −1(𝑠) using the empirical quantile function for the linear model:

^𝑄(𝜏|𝑥) = 𝑥𝑇 ^𝛼(𝜏)

Taking this into account, we can estimate 𝑓(𝐹 −1(𝑡)):

𝑓𝑛(𝐹 −1

𝑛 (𝑡)) =

2ℎ𝑛

𝑥𝑇(^𝛼(𝑡 + ℎ𝑛) − ^𝛼(𝑡 − ℎ𝑛))

(10)

(11)

1 Even when the residual errors are asymptotically distributed according to a normal.

6

To better understand how a variation in the fiscal credibility index may affect the probability
of the Brazilian economy closing the year outside the inflation target, we follow the specification
proposed by Mendonca e Silva (2016).

Furthermore, we estimate a Hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve:

𝜋𝑡 = 𝛽1𝜋𝑡−1 + 𝛽2𝐸𝑡[𝜋𝑡+1] − 𝛽3𝑥𝑡 + 𝛽5𝐼𝐶𝐹𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡

(12)

But these version of the Phillips curve present an endogeneity problem. Consequently, the simple
Quantile Regression estimation is inconsistent and must be replaced by the Two Stage Quantile
Regression (TSQR) method. Moreover, to deal with heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation we use
the Moving Block Bootstrap (MBB) method by Fitzenberger (1998).

All the data are analyzed in monthly frequency. The accumulated 12-month inflation is mea-
sured by the IPCA and seasonally adjusted. For inflation expectations we use the Central Bank
reports based on the FOCUS estimates over the next 12 months. For the gap variable, which is often
treated as the marginal cost of the economy, we chose two proxies based on the works of Gali e Gertler
(1999) and Sims (2008): 1) The Brazilian industrial output and 2) The share of total wages in output.
We calculate (1) as the difference between the industrial production index, seasonally adjusted using
the X13- ARIMA, and its potential value obtained through the Hodrick-Prescott filter. Finally, 2) is
constructed as the ratio between the effective wage mass of the economically active population and
the nominal GDP, seasonally adjusted using the X13-ARIMA method.

For changes in the prices of the non-produced input, (Δ𝑣𝑡), we follow Mazali e Divino (2010)
and calculate the percentage change in the nominal exchange rate between real and dollar for a
three-period interval, according to the following formula Δ𝑣𝑡 = 100𝑙𝑛

The following variables are endogenous: Output Gap, Wage Mass, Inflation Expectations, Un-
employment and Exchange Rate. In this context, following Blanchard e Galí (2007), Mazali e Divino
(2010), Chorteas et al. (2012) and Boz (2013), all these variables were instrumentalized using two
inflation lags and two lags of the variable itself, except in the case of inflation expectations that the
literature suggests the use of only one lag.3
2 All variables, after treatments, are stationary. The tests used were ADF, ADF-GLS, PP and KPSS.
3 From the Cragg-Donald and Kleibergen-Paap tests, we reject the null hypothesis that the chosen instruments are

4 Results
4.1 Instrumental Baseline Quantile Regression

The estimated coefficients follow in the table below. As we can see, the estimates indicate stable
behavior (between quantiles) for the coefficients of: lag component, expectations and product gap.
In other words, there is no evidence of asymmetry in these variables. However, when we observe the
variable fiscal credibility, we can note that (especially at the extremes) the coefficients differ from the
2SLS estimates, represented by the horizontal orange lines. The QR and 2SLS confidence intervals
are not intercepted, which reinforces the asymmetric marginal effect of fiscal credibility on inflation
accumulated in the last 12-months.

line represents the estimated coefficients for each quantile and the shaded region shows the confidence
interval for these estimates. In addition, the horizontal lines represent the 2SLS (orange) values with
their respective confidence intervals (dashed orange lines):

Note: The y-axis indicates the value of the coefficient and x-axis the quantile analyzed.

The estimated results, for all percentiles, reinforce what was found in the previous table (based
on 95% confidence level). The coefficients associated to fiscal credibility present asymmetric behavior
in extreme quantiles. Moreover, the magnitude and sign of marginal effects change: positive at low
levels of accumulated inflation and negative in periods of price acceleration. This result illustrates a
behavior not yet documented by the Brazilian literature. Indicating that, for low levels of accumulated
inflation, fiscal credibility can exert a perverse effect, boosting the index of aggregate prices in the
economy.

Following, to capture this asymmetry, that the fiscal credibility index can induce in the accu-
mulated inflation trajectory, we estimate the conditional density functions at each point in time. We
perform the following exercise: First, we calculate the probability curve that: in each month, accumu-
lated inflation does not fall within the annual target. We then compare these estimates with a new
probability curve for the same data but with the fiscal credibility index plus 1 standard deviation
each month.

In some cases, the improvement in the fiscal credibility index (+1 standard deviation) can
reduce the probability that accumulated inflation does not remain within the limits established by
the Central Bank by up to 35%. However, the most interesting results are those that confirm the
phenomenon found in the previous table: In specific periods, the improvement in the fiscal credibility
index may hinder the fulfillment of the inflation target. This phenomenon contradicts the conventional
literature estimates (focused on the mean parameters).

estimated monthly based on the observed values of the variables and 2: Density is estimated based on the same data, but with
a plus of +1 standard deviation in fiscal credibility index each month.

This result, using intuitively what was proposed by Lucas (1972), indicates that the effectiveness
of some policy strategies may vary according to the agents perceptions. Therefore, an average effect,
some times, can lead us to a sub-effectiveness of the desired economic policy.

4.2 Robusteness

To validate the findings, we performed some robustness tests in the model. In other words, we
submit the new Keynesian Phillips curve to some changes in the proxies for economic activity and
inclusion of the exchange component, seeking to understand the level of sensitivity of the results
found previously4:

1. Use of Wage Mass as measure of economic activity;

2. Use of IBC-Br Gap as measure of economic activity;

3. Inclusion of exchange pass-through in Industrial Production Gap model;

4 The graphs and probability curves (for all tests) can be found in the Appendix.

5. Inclusion of exchange pass-through in IBC-Br Gap model.

6. Inclusion of exchange pass-through and use of Unemployment.

When we replace the gap measure (Industrial Production) by Wage Mass and IBC-Br, we ob-
serve results similar to the previous ones. First, the backward-looking component oscillates between
0.65 and 0.80, within the 2SLS confidence interval. The inflation expectations (forward-looking com-
ponent) show stable behaviour over the quantiles and the real economic activity variable presents no
statistical significance, mostly. However, the fiscal credibility index shows a decreasing behavior along
the quantiles and significant in the extremes, changing the sign but oscillating less in magnitude.
Following, when we replace the industrial product gap with the IBC-Br gap, the results remain. But
with a small improvement in the significance of the real variable (IBC-Br) in the quantiles near the
median.

Basically, from these two initial robustness tests, we can conclude that changes in the variable
that measures the real activity do not change the results of the estimated coefficients. So that the
asymmetry verified in the variable index of fiscal credibility is maintained throughout the quantiles.
This result allows us to re-estimate the probability curves, in order to verify if the improvement in
fiscal credibility can affect the probability that accumulated inflation will close the month within the
target.

Again, there are indications that an improvement in fiscal credibility can reduce the probability
that accumulated inflation does not remain within the target regime bands. However, in the case of
wage mass, the reduction in probability reaches a maximum value of 20%. What is interesting to note,
again, is when an improvement in credibility leads to an increase in the likelihood that cumulative
inflation will close the month off the target. Moreover, it occurs mostly when inflation has been
kept within the target for a prolonged period. Consequently, this reinforces the previous results of
the positive coefficients at the lower quantiles of the conditional distribution of the accumulated
inflation.

We can observe the same behavior when the industrial production variable is replaced by the
IBC-Br, so that the reduction reaches the maximum value of 25 %. Moreover, we note the return
of the previously verified patter (in the same periods): a possible increase in the probability of
cumulative inflation being out of target after improvements in fiscal credibility.

Now, moving to the final robustness tests (relative to the addition of the pass through compo-
nent), we can observe that the results for the backward and forward looking components are stable,
as well as the non-significance of the real variable remains. Following, the wage mass proxy presents
a slight gain of significance in the lower quantiles, while the IBC-Br is concentrated mainly in the
quantiles near the median. But the inclusion of the new variable seems to allow an even better
visualization of the asymmetry present in the coefficients of the fiscal credibility index (for all eco-
nomic activity proxies), since the differences (to the estimated value in the mean (2SLS)) are more
expressive in extreme quantiles.

Finally, after verifying similar results (in the estimated quantile coefficients) with the addition
of the exchange component, we proceeded to re-estimate the conditional probability curves, in order
to verify how an improvement in fiscal credibility can affect the accumulated inflation dynamics and
the fulfillment of the inflation target, considering a generalized increase of one standard deviation in
every month of the fiscal credibility index. Once again, the results already observed are verified.

5 Conclusions

The main objective of this paper is to advance in the investigation of fiscal credibility index
effects on inflation dynamics. Specifically, we calculate the probability that the price level remains
within the inflation target. First, we investigate changes in the slope coefficients of dependent vari-
ables in one hundred quantiles. We found a stable behavior (between quantiles) for the coefficients
of lag component, expectations and product gap.

Moreover, the most interesting results are based on the asymmetry of the fiscal credibility in-
dex, which has a positive effect at the 05% - 20% quantiles and negative at 70% - 99% quantiles of
the accumulated inflation. This unexpected behavior is reinforced by the estimation of the condi-
tional density functions, even after performing robustness tests in the model. An improvement of +1
standard deviation in the fiscal credibility index can, mostly in periods of high / moderate inflation,
reduce the likelihood by up to 35 % of accumulated monthly inflation to close the month outside the
target range.

However, there are exceptions. Apparently, after long periods of monetary stability, shocks to
fiscal credibility may induce an increase in the price level through the channel of expectations. That
is, we believe that agents may understand the attempt to improve fiscal stability as an indicative of
a possible future discretionary behavior, then they adjust prices upwards and the effect expected by
the government would not be verified. Finally, we believe that future studies, which seek to verify
the persistence and dynamics of accumulated inflation shocks, as well as to delimit the periods, may
expand the results found in this paper.
