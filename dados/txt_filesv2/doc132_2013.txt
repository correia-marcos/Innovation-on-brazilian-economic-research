RESUMO 

 

A  literatura  que  analisa  a  distribuição  espacial  da  produção  científica  e  tecnológica  no  Brasil  identifica 
diferenças  na  distribuição  regional  dos  recursos  científicos  e  tecnológicos.  Nosso  objetivo  é  contribuir 
para a discussão sobre o assunto, analisando a dinâmica da produção de novos conhecimentos científicos 
nos estados que mais contribuem para a produção científica nacional, ou seja, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, 
Minas  Gerais  e  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  (‘quarteto  científico’)  no  período  de  2000  a  2010.  A  hipótese 
específica  deste  estudo  é  que,  mesmo  com  as  políticas  federais  voltadas  para  a  ampliação  e 
descentralização  da  produção  de  novos  conhecimentos  científicos,  sua  produção  ainda  é  fortemente 
ancorada  no  ‘quarteto  científico’.  Identificamos  ainda  uma  concentração  da  produção  científica  em  três 
grandes áreas do conhecimento: ciências agrárias, biológicas e da saúde.

ABSTRACT 

 

The  literature  that  analyzes  the  spatial  distribution  of  scientific  and  technological  production  in  Brazil 
identifies  the  differences  in  regional  distribution  of  scientific  and  technological  resources.  We  aim  to 
contribute  to  the  discussion  on  this  subject,  analyzing  the  dynamics  of  the  production  of  new  scientific 
knowledge in the states that contribute most to the national scientific production, namely, Sao Paulo, Rio 
de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul (‘the scientific quartet’) in the period 2000 to 2010. The 
specific  hypothesis  of  this  study  is  that  even  with  federal  policies  aimed  at  the  expansion  and 
decentralization of the production of new scientific knowledge, its production is still strongly anchored in 
the ‘the scientific quartet’. We identified a concentration of scientific production in three major areas of 
knowledge: agricultural sciences, biological and health.

INTRODUCTION 
 

The  spatial  allocation  of  scientific  and  technological  production  in  Brazil  is  marked  by  strong 
disparities in the regional distribution of scientific and technological resources. Intellectual and research 
assets  are  heavily  concentrated  in  the  South-East  region,  particularly  in  the  state  of  Sao  Paulo  (Barros, 
2000; Albuquerque et al., 2002, 2005; Diniz and Gonçalves, 2005; Santos and Caliari, 2012; Faria et al., 
2011). 

A part of this concentration can be explained through the historical trajectory of the emergence of 
science  and  technology  (S&T)  institutions  in  the  country,  particularly  the  universities  and  research 
institutes,  described  in  Suzigan  and  Albuquerque  (2011).  These  institutions  were  built  in  waves 
throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Most of them were created in the southeastern states of 
the country, mainly in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, given the economic strength of these 
two states in the coffee plantation and the public administration activities.  

We chose to focus the analysis on Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul 
states  (‘scientific  quartet’),  by  showing  the  bibliographic  production  dynamism  of  these  states  over  the 
period  2000-2010,  from  a  static  comparative  analysis,  once  they  are  the  epicenter  of  Brazilian  science. 
This article therefore constitutes an additional contribution to the existing literature on the national spatial 
distribution  of  scientific  production  in  Brazil,  since  it  does  not  restrict  the  analysis  to  a  given  year,  but 
over  a  period  of  a  decade  (2000-2010),  allowing  to  identify  their  temporal  and  spatial  evolution 
throughout the decade. In this regard, it is worth noting that in Brazil, the process of decentralization of  
S&T  promotion  is  relatively new but  it has been advancing intensively in the last ten  years,  pari passu 
with  the  strengthening  of  the  National  Innovation  System  (NIS),  and  contrasts  with  the  centralization 
observed in the 1970’s and 1980’s (CGEE, 2010). 

The  hypothesis  of  this  study  is  that  even  with  federal  policies  aimed  at  the  expansion  and 
decentralization  of  production  of  scientific  knowledge  (e.g.,  from  the  creation  of  new  federally  funded 
universities  in  the  North  and  Northeast,  what  could  be  considered  as  another  wave  of  university 
establishments),  the  national  scientific  production  is  still  strongly  anchored  in  the  ‘scientific  quartet’ 
throughout the decade of 2000. 

To  achieve  the  goal  proposed  here,  the  article  was  structured  in  the  following  manner:  the  first 
section presents the main conceptual structure of a National Innovation System (NIS) and its immaturity 
and concentration in Brazil. The second presents the database and section three focuses on the four states 
which form the epicenter of Brazilian science (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul and Minas 
Gerais)  over the 2000 to 2010 using the Directory  of Research Groups (DRG) censuses of the National 
Council  for  Scientific  and  Technological  Development  (CNPq),  evaluating  the  distribution  of  scientific 
activities  between  them  and  comparing  them  to  other  Brazilian  states.  The  fourth  section  presents  the 
distribution of scientific production of the ‘quartet’ by major field of knowledge and its evolution over the 
period analyzed. Finally, the last section will make final remarks about this study. 

 

  THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 

1 
 
1.1   Universities and Public Research Institutes in National Innovation Systems  
 

The  National  Innovation  System  (NIS)  can  be  characterized  as  an  institutional  arrangement  that 
involves  various  constituents  that  interact  and  interrelate  with  each  other,  namely:  (1)  firms,  with  their 
laboratories  for  research  and  development  (R&D)  and  their  cooperation  and  interaction  networks,  (2) 
universities and research institutes, (3) educational institutions, (4) financial system capable of supporting 
innovative  investment,  (5)  legal  systems,  (6)  market  and  non-market  mechanisms  of  selection;  (7) 
governments  and  (8)  mechanisms  and  coordination  institutions  (Nelson,  1993;  Lundvall,  1988,  1992; 
Freeman, 1995). 

Basic science and technology are guided by theory and by experiment and are designed primarily, 
but  not  exclusively,  in  universities  and  public  research  laboratories  (Metcalfe,  2003).  Universities  and 
public  research  institutes  (PRIs)  therefore  play  a  central  role  in  the  creation  and  dissemination  of 
knowledge  through  traditional  functions,  such  as  education  and  basic  research,  thus  constituting  key 

2 

 

elements  within  the  NIS.  Thus,  creating  and  renewing  the  stock  of  existing  knowledge  in  the  countries 
where  they  operate.  They  also  play  an  important  role  in  technological  development,  whether  in  the 
education  and  training  of  engineers  and  industrial  scientists  or  as  a  source  of  research  results  and 
techniques  of  considerable  relevance  to  the  technical  advancement  of  industry  (Nelson  and  Rosenberg, 
1993). 

Additionally, universities and PRIs develop and provide new insights that influence the productive 
sector  through  research  disseminated  in  publications,  cooperative  research  projects  or  consultancy 
(Schartinger  et  al.,  2001,  2002).  That  is,  in  the  NIS,  these  institutions  have  a  role  of  producers  and 
distributors of scientific knowledge and not just training and qualification of human resources (Cohen et 
al., 2002). 

It should be noted that the literature suggests the existence of specific functions of universities in 
peripheral countries. For Albuquerque (1999), the main difference lies in the contribution they can offer 
to  the  process  of  catching  up.  According  to  the  author,  the  scientific  infrastructure  in  the  peripheral 
countries can act as an ‘antenna’ in the identification of technological opportunities, connecting the NIS 
to international scientific and technological flows. 

A peculiarity of the immature NIS1, as the case of Brazil, is the existence of ‘partial connections’ 
between the scientific infrastructure and technological  activities  (Albuquerque, 1999;  2003) which limit 
the  importance  of  interaction  among  its  various  constituents.  This  is  because  the  flow  of  knowledge 
between  science  and  technology  is  restricted  to  a  small  number  of  connections  or  interactions  (Rapini, 
2007; Suzigan and Albuquerque, 2008). Additionally, firms generally develop few R&D activities, which 
makes  university-industry  interactions  and  the  strengthening  of  the  innovative  capacity  of  the  country 
difficult (Rapini et al., 2009). It is noteworthy that these studies suggest that in addition to the traditional 
functions (information  source, providing skilled labor force, training, etc.) universities in  immature NIS 
can play a dual role, i.e. they replace and complement firms’ R&D. 

1.2 

 
Regional distribution of scientific activities in Brazil  
 
As well as the immature character of the Brazilian innovation system, the country has three other 
important features: its continental dimension; the regional disparities regarding its technical and scientific 
infrastructure, and the concentration of scientific production in public universities and in public research 
institutions. 

It is important to note, from the historiographic work of Suzigan and Albuquerque (2008), that the 
main  institutions  of  S&T  research,  as  well  as  higher  education  were  established  in  the  second  wave  of 
creation of these institutions at the end of the nineteenth century, most surrounding the economic strength 
and  modernization  of  the  cities  of  Rio  de  Janeiro,  then  the  capital,  and  Sao  Paulo,  the  financial  and 
administrative  center  coming  from  the  coffee  cycle.  The  tradition  of  agricultural  research  in  many 
different  cultures,  research  in  public  health  and  parasitology  dates  from  this  time  and,  therefore,  the 
competence of the researchers involved in these areas and these sites also tend to be notorious (Suzigan 
and Albuquerque, 2008).  

Moreover,  Diniz  and  Gonçalves  (2005),  in  a  diagnostic  of  the  knowledge  infrastructure 
distribution  in  Brazil  characterized  by  academic  university  system,  research  institutions  and  the 
distribution  of  skilled  human  resources,  identified  a  concentration  of  active  research  and  technological 
development in the most developed economic centers of the country. To Diniz (2001), the fact that major 
universities and research institutions, professional labor market and modern urban infrastructure services 
are  located  in  major  cities  of  the  center-south  region  of  the  country,  means  there  is  a  tendency  to

Albuquerque (1999) suggests a typology that distinguishes the NISs according to their level of development: mature 
in developed countries; immature countries at an intermediate level, such as the Latin  American countries, South Africa and 
India; ‘nonexistent or rudimentary’ NIS in less developed countries. There are intrinsic elements to peripheral economies that 
hinder  the  ‘maturity’  of  the  innovation  system.  The  dependence  of  the  production  of  new  knowledge  in  core  economies  is 
important,  moreover,  peripheral  economies  have  built  their  bases  and  insufficient  accumulation  below  the  needs  for  a 
technological  breakthrough,  therefore,  are  unable  to  turn  knowledge  and  science  into  innovation,  and  have  an  atrophied 
financial sector, problems of inequality and poverty, in short, a sort of diverse structural problems (Oliveira, 2003).

emphasize the strength of the network services in the region, enhancing regional concentration, given the 
regional distribution of production and income in Brazil.  

Additionally, Barros (2000) identified that the large regional differences regarding the technical-
scientific basis installed in Brazil reflected particularly in the concentration of skilled human resources for 
research in the Center-South and the channeling of most federal public investments allocated to S&T in 
those regions. The three less dynamic regions (Northeast, Midwest  and North) aggregated together,  had 
only 18% of researchers in Brazil in a survey done by the author using the Directory of Research Group 
Census  of  the  National  Council  for  Scientific  and  Technological  Development  (DRG/CNPq)  in  1997. 
Barros  (2000)  also  showed  a  reproduction  of  the  observed  concentration  in  expenditures  by  federal 
sources  in  the  mid-1990s,  in  the  case  of  state  and  local  investments  that  aim  at  technical  and  scientific 
development.  

In  an  effort  to  measure  the  S&T  concentration  in  Brazil,  Santos  and  Caliari  (2012)  assessed  the 
degree  of  concentration  of  the  structures  to  support  technological  innovation  in  the  country,  taking  as 
parameter  the  degree  of  inequality  between  the  fifty  largest  micro-regions  of  the  country,  in  the  years 
2003  and  2008.  The  authors  have  identified  a  high  concentration  of  these  technological  innovation 
structures in a small number of Brazilian micro-regions. Therefore, such scenario has not changed in this 
period. 

However, Barros (2000) also found that despite the political instability of the vast majority of state 
systems  of  S&T,  the  performance  of  some  states  of  the  federation  (as  Ceara,  Rio  Grande  do  Sul, 
Pernambuco and Bahia, among others) represented on the national scene were more promising, not only 
because  they  were  increasing  their  investments  in  S&T,  but  also  because  they  were  enhancing  their 
institutional organization, their articulations and performances. 

According  to  CGEE  (2010),  the    advancement  and  the  institutional  structuration  of  the 
decentralization of the promotion of science, technology and innovation (ST&I) in Brazil at the end of the 
90’s and in the first decade of the 2000’s was based on: a) the creation of the so-called Fundos Setoriais 
(Sectorial Funds), in which a portion of the resources in a given sector (petroleum, electric power) is used 
to finance research projects in these sectors with universities and public research institutions (PRIs), at the 
federal  level,  after  1997;  b)  the  initiative  of  the  institutional  organizational  of  the  states  in  the  area  of 
ST&I (state funds of ST&I, state foundations to support the research activities, especially within medium 
and small companies2 ) and; c) the creation of federal programs of support that are shared with states and 
the  private  sector,  such  as  the  RHAE3  program,  which  stimulates  the  insertion  of  master  and  doctorate 
degrees within firms, by funding research projects that interests the companies through Sectorial and state 
funds (CGEE, 2011). 

Most private higher education institutions in Brazil are focused only on teaching. Considering that 
it  is  not  the  intention  of  this  paper  to  discuss  the  relevance  or  quality  of  the  training  offered  by  the 
Brazilian private higher educational institutions, we only emphasize that private institutions dedicated to 
scientific research are rare exceptions in  Brazil, being the production of  scientific knowledge mainly in 
charge of public universities (Chiarini et al., 2012). Following the classification proposed by Nowotny et 
al.  (2001),  we  can  say  that  the  private  universities  in  Brazil,  roughly  speaking,  are  concerned  with 
knowledgeability, i.e. with the formation of a more educated and enlightened population. In contrast, the 
Brazilian public universities are engaged, besides the knowledgeability, with the production of scientific 
knowledge per se. 

The  government  effort  to  increase  capacity  for  the  production  of  scientific  knowledge  in  other 
regions  of  the  country  deprived  of  infrastructure,  especially  the  North  and  Northeast,  is  represented  in 
Table 1. We could consider this as another wave of creation of public higher education infrastructure.

There was an increase in federal universities in all regions of Brazil and universities increased by 
federative  unit4.  The  Brazilian  Northeast,  which  in  2000  had  1  federally  funded  university  per  state  in 
2010 had increased slightly to 1.1 per state. What one can notice is the concern of the central government 
to  expand  the  supply  of  higher  education  institutions  able  to  help  boost  the  NIS.  The  most  important 
figures shows that the number of universities in  the northeast region increased 25% in ten  years, and in 
the north region, 66%, as the number of universities in the southeast region increased by 13% in the same 
period.  The  public  universities  accounted  for  83%  of  the  total  in  northeast  and  for  93%  in  the  north 
region.

ABOUT THE DATABASE 

The work proposed here makes use of data provided in the Directory of Research Groups (DRG), 
which  was  initiated  in  1992  by  the  National  Council  for  Scientific  and  Technological  Development 
(CNPq),  a  public  agency  of  the  Brazilian  Science,  Technology  and  Innovation  Ministry  (MCTI)  Since 
then,  with  a  biannual  frequency,  the  agency  provides  a  census  of  research  capacity  in  the  country, 
measured by active groups in each period. The DRG/CNPq gathers information from various institutions, 
among  them,  there  are  information  regarding  the  public  (federal,  state,  municipal)  and  private 
universities, research institutes, public and private R&D laboratories, and nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs)  permanently  engaged  in  scientific  and  technological  research.  However,  private  firms  in  the 
industrial sector are not included in this directory.   
The  DRG/CNPq  comprises  detailed  information  regarding  research  activities  in  Brazil  using 
 
‘research  group’  as  the  unit  of  analysis.  It  includes  references  from  the  existing  research  groups  in  the 
country and lists several of their characteristics. The DRG’s definition of research group is a hierarchical 
set  of  researchers,  students,  and  personnel  with  specific  technical  scientific  competencies  that  perform 
scientific research in a specialized field, sharing or not physical space and resources. 

Among the information gathered in the DRG/CNPq, disaggregated by region and time, State and 
institution, are those related to human resources of the research groups, such as researchers, students and 
technical  areas  of  research  pursued  by  these  groups;  knowledge  areas,  industry  sectors  involved,  the

In the 2000’s the following federal universities were created: a) Central-West region: Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados 
(UFGD);  b)  North  region:  Universidade  Federal  Rural da  Amazônia  (UFRA)  and  Universidade  Federal  do  Tocantins  (UFT);  c)  Northeast 
region: Universidade Federal de Campina Grande (UFCG), Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido (UFERSA), Universidade Federal do 
Recôncavo da Bahia (UFRB); Universidade da Integração Internacional da Lusofonia Afro-Brasileira (UNILAB) and Universidade Federal 
do Vale do São Francisco (UNIVASF); d) South region: Universidade Federal da Fronteira Sul (UFFS); Universidade Federal da Integração 
Latino-Americana  (UNILA);  Universidade  Federal  do  Pampa  (UNIPAMPA)  and  Universidade  Tecnológica  Federal  do  Paraná  (UTFPR); 
Southeast  region:  Universidade  Federal  do  ABC  (UFABC),  Universidade  Federal  de  São  João  Del  Rei  (UFSJ),  Universidade  Federal  do 
Triângulo  Mineiro  (UFTM),  Universidade  Federal  do  Vale  do  Jequitinhonha  e  Mucuri  (UFVJM),  Universidade  Federal  de  Alfenas 
(UNIFAL)  and  Universidade  Federal  de  Itajubá  (UNIFEI).  According  to  the  Brazilian  Ministry  of  Education  (MEC),  four  other  federal 
universities will be created in the coming years in the North and Northeast regions: Universidade Federal do Sul e Sudeste do Pará (UFSPA), 
Universidade Federal da Região do Cariri (UFRC), Universidade Federal do Oeste da Bahia (UFOBA) and Universidade Federal do Sul da 
Bahia (UFESBA). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the UFSJ, UFTM, UFVJM, UNIFAL, UNIFEI, UFRA, UFERSA and UTFPR existed 
before,  but  were  either  educational  foundations,  federal  schools  or  federal  technical  schools.  It  can  be  seen  that,  in  2000,  18  new  federal 
universities were  created, of  which eight are located in states outside the ‘quartet’ and if  we do not consider the federal schools of higher 
education  that  became  universities,  we  have  that  from  10  universities  effectively  created  in  the  2000s,  only  three  (UFABC,  UFFS  and  
UNIPAMPA) are part of the ‘quartet’.

production  of  scientific  and  technological  researchers  and  students  groups,  and  patterns  of  interaction 
with the productive sector. 
The  DRG/CNPq  provides  an  excellent  proxy  for  studying  research  activities  in  Brazil,  even 
 
though adherence to it is voluntary (Povoa and Rapini, 2010), however, researchers are highly encouraged 
to  participate,  mainly  to  have  access  to  public  funding  to  scientific  research  and  other  incentives.  The 
universe  of  DRG/CNPq  has  grown  in  recent  years  and  now  covers  a  representative  part  of  the  national 
scientific community (Carneiroand Lorenzo, 2003). 

Taking  as  the  unit  of  analysis  the  researcher,  this  article  describes  the  spatial  distribution  of 
scientific  activities  in  Brazil,  from  scientific  published  articles  (a  proxy  for  scientific  production)  and 
researchers  (an  indicator  of  human  resources  allocated  to  scientific  activities),  as  Albuquerque  et  al. 
(2002) did.

THE SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION OF THE ‘QUARTET’ 
 
In  this  section,  we  focus  on  the  temporal  and  spatial  evolution  of  the  relative  shares  of  the 
epicenter  of  Brazilian  science,  i.e.  the  four  units  of  the  federation,  namely  Sao  Paulo,  Rio  de  Janeiro, 
Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul (the ‘scientific quartet’) in national scientific production from 2000 
to 2010. This research is a contribution to the assessment of the degree of (de)concentration of activities 
in science. We present, initially, a comparison between the numbers of researchers (including researchers 
with  PhD  degree)  in  different  regions  of  the  country  and  within  the  ‘quartet’.  Later,  we  deepen  this 
research by examining the degree of dispersion and inequality in the distribution of scientific productivity 
of Brazilian researchers between the states and the ‘quartet’ and within the ‘quartet’.  

 

3.1   Growth of knowledge production of Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul compared  

to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro: towards convergence? 

 

The DRG/CNPq shows that, in 2000, the less dynamic regions of the country - Northeast, Central-
West  and  North  -  were  responsible  for  25.8%  of  national  researchers,  and,  of  the  national  total,  13.0% 
were PhD researchers of these three regions. The other 74.2% of the national researchers were located in 
the South and Southeast of the country (where, of the national total, 36.0% of the researchers had a PhD 
degree from these regions). 

In 2010, the less dynamic regions (Northeast, Central-West and North) have concentrated 34.0% 
of national researchers, with only 20.0% of the national total were PhD researchers in these regions. As 
for the other regions (South and Southeast), which accounted for 74.2% of researchers in 2000, in 2010 
accounted for 66.0% of all national researchers. 

Sao  Paulo,  Minas  Gerais,  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  alone,  concentrated,  in  2000, 
64.3% of all Brazilian researchers. In 2010, these four states participating in the national total dropped to 
57.7% (Table 2), which, however, is still quite high. This devolution might be explained by the growing 
demand  for  researchers  and  professors  at  other  institutions  of  education  and  research  in  the  country,  to 
form  a  professional  body  of  higher  level  and  thus  able  to  raise  the  capacity  of  these  institutions  in  the 
national  S&T  production.  This  was  due  to  the  federal  government’s  attempt  to  expand  the  network  of 
public teaching and  research in  other states. This can be  considered an important  step  in  leveraging the 
scientific development of a region towards the consolidation of a set of actors with an advanced scientific 
basis,  since  there  is  the  possibility,  on  the  one  hand,  to  increase  the  supply  of  skilled  highly  qualified 
labor  and  at  the  same  time,  increase  the  supply  of  research  that  can  be  used  by  various  sectors  of  the 
economy, especially industry.

Sao Paulo is the state with most researchers and there has been a growth of 121.9% in the period 
2000-2010, although its share in the national total has dropped from 30.5% to 24.2%. The state of Rio de 
Janeiro, although it has also experienced a growth of 136.6% in the number of researchers, has its share of 
total  national  reduced  from  14.7%  to  12.4%.  Minas  Gerais,  in  turn,  was  the  state  that  had  the  highest 
growth rate of researchers, 249.1%, reaching, in 2010, 16,678 researchers. It is interesting to note that the 
state of Rio de Janeiro always had more researchers than Minas Gerais in the period 2000-2010, although 
the  latter  state  has  had  a  growth  rate  much  higher  than  the  former,  thus  approaching  that  state 
participation  in  number  of  researchers  (11.3%).  These  analyses  suggest  the  occurrence  of  a  small 
devolution of scientific-technical base in the ‘quartet’. Table 3 shows the evolution of these numbers.

Regarding  the  scientific  literature,  the  ‘quartet’  concentrated  in  the  2000’s  over  70.0%  of  all 
domestic production of articles published in national and international journals (Table 2). This argument 
supports  previous  studies  that  had  signaled  the  existence  of  spatial  concentration  of  scientific-technical 
base  in  southern  and  southeastern  Brazil  (Barros,  2000;  Albuquerque  et  al.,  2002,  2005;  Diniz  and 
Gonçalves,  2005;  Santos  and  Caliari,  2012;  Faria  et  al.,  2011).  The  period  2000-2010  maintains  the 
centralization  of  production  of  new  scientific  knowledge  (measured  by  article  production  volume,  i.e., 
national  and  international  articles  published  in  indexed  journals)  in  the  South-East,  and  once  more  Sao 
Paulo stands out as the main state. Those states concentrated 76.2% of all articles published in Brazil in 
2000. In 2010, 73.3% (Table 2). 

In  absolute  terms,  Sao  Paulo  is  the  state  of  the  federation  that  publishes  more  (proxy  for 
production of new scientific knowledge), reaching to a total of more than 243,000 articles in 2010 and its 
growth rate of scientific production in 2000-2010 was of 291.0%. There was a slight decrease in the gap 
of production of new articles published in the state of Sao Paulo and the other three states that published 
(Minas  Gerais,  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul),  as  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  and  Minas  Gerais  had 
growth  rates  greater  than  that  of  Sao  Paulo,  414.0%  and  357.0%,  respectively,  over  the  same  period 
(2000-2010). The publishing rate of Rio de Janeiro state, in turn, was lower than Sao Paulo, both of which 
are  lower  than  the  growth  rate  of  the  country  (which  was  331.0%  between  2000  and  2010)  (Table  4). 
Thereby contributing to the reduction of this gap within the ‘quartet’ was the rapid growth of publications 
by researchers of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul.

Additionally, to verify the output per researcher, though Sao Paulo has an absolute advantage in 
terms of articles, its productivity is only slightly higher than the other states in the analysis. Minas Gerais 
contributed  to  21,618  publications  in  indexed  national  and  international  journals  in  2000  and  98,900  in 
2010, representing a growth of 357.0%. Its participation in the national total, which was 12.8% in 2002, 
rose to 13.6% in 2010, approaching the participation of Rio de Janeiro, which has appropriated 16.0% of 
national publications in 2002 and fell to 13.8% in 2010. 

Figures 1 and 2 show the evolution of peer-reviewed published articles and peer-reviewed articles 

per researcher for the four states of the ‘quartet’.

The  good  performance  of  Minas  Gerais  took  place  due  to  the  high  scientific  productivity  of  some 
institutions  of  that  state  that  influenced  the  increase  in  the  state  average  (5.9),  as  was  the  case,  for 
example,  the  Institute  of  Education  and  Research  of  Santa  Casa  de  Belo  Horizonte  (IEP/SCBH),  the 
Foundation  Center  of  Hematology  of  Minas  Gerais  (Hemominas),  Research  Center  René  Rachou 
(CPqRR/FIOCRUZ) and the Agricultural Research Corporation of Minas Gerais (EPAMIG) (primarily in 
the  areas  of  health,  life  sciences  and  agricultural  sciences,  as  will  be  seen  in  the  next  section). 
Interestingly,  in  this  case,  the  federal  universities  had  lower  scientific  productivity  than  the  PRIs,  an 
aspect  that deserves more detailed studies later.  The most dynamic universities in  terms  of productivity 
were Federal University of Lavras (UFLA), Federal University of Viçosa (UFV) and Federal University 
of Minas Gerais (UFMG), in that order.

However, surprisingly, in the analyzed period, the increase in productivity was the researchers of 
Rio Grande do Sul, measured in terms of published papers per researcher, which rose 91.0%, a rate higher 
than the states of Sao Paulo (74.4%), Rio de Janeiro (54.3%) and Minas Gerais (31.0%). Rio Grande do 
Sul,  which  in  2000  published  just  over  17,000  articles,  reached  2010  with  a  total  of  89,870  articles, 
representing a growth of 414.0%, much higher than the other states. This growth has not only increased 
by researchers, but also by increasing the productivity of those, who changed from 3.3 to 6.3 articles per 
researcher in the decade under review. 

The  excellent  performance  of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  occurred  due  to  the  high  productivity  of  some 
institutions  such  as  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Technology  for  Leather,  Footwear  and  Artifact  (IBTEC), 
Clinics Hospital of Porto Alegre (HCPA) and the Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre 
(UFCSPA), which had, in 2010, a very high productivity: IBTEC with 15.6 articles per researcher, HCPA 
with  11.0  and  UFCSPA  with  8.5,  positively  influencing  the  performance  of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul5  (all 
basically  in  the  health  and  biological  sciences  as  will  be  seen  in  the  next  section).  The  same  feature 
weight of public research institutes in the relevant scientific production can also be observed for the Rio 
Grande do Sul, although less than in Minas Gerais. 

The  previous  analysis  provide  evidence  for  the  argument  that  significant  increases  of  scientific 
productivity  of  researchers  of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  and  Minas  Gerais  may  be  related  to  higher  rates  of 
growth  of  the  infrastructure  of  these  states  in  order  to  decrease  a  relative  delay  in  relation  to  the 
infrastructure and institutions of science of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.  

 

3.2   Devolution of knowledge production in the country? 

 

Figure  3  does  not  indicate  the  occurrence  of  dispersion  of  national  scientific  production  per 
researcher  in  all  the  Brazilian  states  and  within  the  ‘quartet’.  In  fact,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that, 
notwithstanding there has been an increase in scientific productivity in all states of the federation in the 
years  analyzed,  highlighting  some  states  in  the  North,  Northeast  and  Midwest  (Piaui  -PI,  Sergipe-SE, 
Acre-AC,  Amazonas-AM,  Maranhao-MA, Rio  Grande do Norte- RN, Rondonia-RO), whose output  per 
researcher  grows  at  rates  even  higher  than  those  of  the  leading  states  (Table  5),  the  researchers  of  the 
‘quartet’  remain  in  the  two  strata  of  greater  scientific  productivity  of  the  country  in  2000  and  2010. 
Additionally, it appears that even with growth rates in excess of researchers and scientific production, the 
states  of  Minas  Gerais  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  remain  in  a  lower  stratum  of  scientific  output  per 
researcher in relation to the state of Sao Paulo in the year 2010.

Other factors not captured by the data, may have influenced the rapid growth of both Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, such as

However,  when  measuring  the  degree  of  inequality  in  the  distribution  of  productivity  of 
researchers  (using  the  data  distribution  of  Table  5),  based  on  the  calculation  of  the  index  of  inequality 
Theil-T6, to check the evolution of inequality in productivity between Brazilian states in the period from 
2000 to 2010, there was a slight reduction in inequality of distribution, i.e., the data became less unequal. 
The following results were found: in 2000 the Theil-T was 0.048 in 2010 and 0.019, confirming the slight 
fall in inequality in the production of articles per researcher. Disaggregating the index, it was verified that 
there was a fall both within the group formed only by the ‘quartet’ as the group formed by the remaining 
states (in 2000 inequality within the ‘quartet’ was 0.0033 and fell to 0.0014 in 2010, since the inequality 
within  the  group  formed  by  the  remaining  states  was  from  0.044  to  0.014).  The  data  indicate  that 
productivity within the ‘quartet’ was much more homogeneous than the productivity of the group formed 
by the remaining 22 federal units and the Federal District.

This  choice  was  mainly  due  to  the  fact  that  it  can  be  decomposed  into  a  measure  of  inequality  and  inter  groups  on  a  weighted 
average  of  inequality  measures  intra  groups.  In  addition  to  this  property,  this  index  is  more  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  extremes  of  the 
distribution (HOFFMANN, 2006). It is important to use an index with such property as the variables to be analyzed present distribution in 
the lower and upper end.

The  intra  group  inequality  decreased  from  0.03407  in  2000  to  0.01177  in  2010  and  intergroup 
inequality  fell  from  0.01478  to  0.0073,  which  proves  that  both  intra  and  inter-  group  inequalities  were 
responsible for the slight decrease in inequality of output per researcher in the analyzed period (Table 6).

Interestingly,  although  the  inequalities  within  and  between  groups  with  respect  to  productivity 
(i.e.,  articles  by  researcher)  have  reduced  inequalities,  absolute  production  (Table  5)  is  still  very 
accentuated and is higher in the group formed by other states, other than  the ‘quartet’  (compared to the 
‘quartet’).  The  Theil-T  index  in  2000  was  0.46678  and  0.35046  fell,  confirming  the  slight  fall  in 
inequality in the distribution of absolute production. A breakdown of the index is in Table 6.

The scientific  expertise within such higher productive states of the  country is  equally important. 
Albuquerque  et  al.  (2002)  identified  the  areas  of  the  most  influential  Brazilian  states  in  producing 
scientific  knowledge  in  Brazil.  Thus,  Minas  Gerais  State  had  expertise  in  the  area  of  biological  and 
agricultural  sciences.  In  turn,  the  specializations  of  Sao  Paulo  State  were  the  health  sciences  and 
engineering.  The  authors  found  also  that  the  state  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  specialized  in  engineering  and 

11 

 

physical and earth sciences, while scientific specializations identified for the state of Rio Grande do Sul 
were health sciences  and secondarily  agrarian sciences.  The distribution of this scientific production by 
large  areas  of  knowledge  can  be  explained  by  the  historical  trajectory  of  S&T  in  Brazil,  where  the 
tradition of research formed and consolidated in the areas of agricultural sciences, biological and health. 

In this section, the research focuses on the evolution of scientific production of states belonging to 
the  ‘quartet’  in  the  years  2000  to  2010,  by  major  area  of  knowledge  and  knowledge-producing 
institutions. This investigation contributes to the identification of their scientific specializations and how 
they relate to the dynamics of national scientific production in this period. 

Concerning  the  work  of  Albuquerque  et  al.  (2002),  already  mentioned,  which  identified  the 
‘scientific  expertise’  of  the  most  influential  states  in  national  scientific  production,  it  appears  that  just 
Minas Gerais still maintains the scientific specializations taking into account the year 2010. In other states 
there is a change in specialization towards three areas of knowledge: agricultural sciences, biological and 
health. So, the bibliographic production of the four more dynamic states focuses in these areas. 

One  can  check  that  in  the  four  states  the  most  productive  areas  of  knowledge  are  agricultural 
sciences and biological sciences (not to mention the health sciences in Sao Paulo). Examining the specific 
area  of  agricultural  sciences,  it  appears  that  Minas  Gerais  was  the  most  productive  state  in  2010,  with 
10.0 articles per researcher, and Sao Paulo, the second most productive, with 9.8 articles per researcher. 
Already  analyzing  the  biological  sciences  we  have  that  the  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  state  was  the  most 
productive,  followed  by  Sao  Paulo,  with  10.9  and  10.4  articles  per  researcher,  respectively.  Table  7, 
shown below, explores this discussion.

The distribution of the production of articles by major field of knowledge in the states that showed 
a relative increase in output per researcher allows us to realize that productivity in the health sciences in 
this distribution increased over time and became more relevant than the exact and earth sciences, except 
in Minas Gerais. 

Another  important  detail  revealed  in  table  7  is  the  low  production  of  articles  in  the  area  of 
engineering  in  all  members  of  the  ‘quartet’.  Thus,  not  only  the  observed  spatial  concentration  of 
bibliographic production of the  country, though  with  some tendency  of decentralization that knowledge 
production towards less productive states both within the ‘quartet’, as to the rest of the country, as well as 
its concentration in large areas of agricultural sciences, biological and health. 

Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  which  increased  the  productivity  of  its  researchers,  measured  in  terms  of 
published papers per researcher, rose 91.0% between 2000 and 2010, being the highlight of the ‘quartet’, 
as  mentioned  in  the  previous  section,  had  its  success  thanks  to  increased  productivity  in  the  areas  of 
biological and agricultural sciences. This fact stems from the existence of institutions that are related to 
characteristics of productive segments of the state, as shown by Costa et al. (2011), linked to the areas of 
agriculture and health. The main institutions responsible for the excellent performance of Rio Grande do 
Sul in 2010 were already mentioned in the previous section (IBTEC, HCPA and UFCSPA, in health and 
biological)  and  also  the  EMBRAPA/RS,  the  State  Foundation  for  Agricultural  Research  (FEPAGRO), 
both 
the  Institute  of 
Cardiology/Cardiology  University  Foundation  (IC-FUC)  in  the  area  of  health  sciences  and  the  UFPEL, 
UFRGS and UFSM (in several areas, particularly in agricultural sciences, biological and health).

the  biological  sciences; 

in 

Likewise, the state of Minas Gerais, which increase the productivity of its researchers rose 31.0% 
over  that  period,  had  increased  its  resulting  productivity  of  institutions  in  the  areas  of  health  sciences, 
biological and agricultural sciences (IEP/SCBH, HEMOMINAS, CPqRR/FIOCRUZ and EPAMIG). I.e.: 
12 

 

IEP/SCBH  with  23.7  articles  per  researcher,  HEMOMINAS  with  17.5  articles  per  researcher,  CPqRR 
FIOCRUZ  with  13.8  and  EPAMIG  with  9.1  articles  per  researcher.  The  federal  universities  of  Minas 
Gerais were less productive than the public research institute: UFLA (approximately with 10.6 articles per 
researcher) UFV (9.7) and UFMG (6.5). 

However, it is noteworthy that although the productivity of the institutions mentioned above have 
been the greatest in those states, they were not responsible for the large volume of scientific production in 
Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, which was made possible by the federal universities. Table 8 shows 
this.

It may be noted, as had already been mentioned in the previous section, in Minas Gerais that much 
of the knowledge production is borne by the federal universities (Chiarini and Vieira, 2012). UFMG, in 
2010,  accounted  for  29.0%  of  all  bibliographic  production  in  the  state,  followed  by  UFV  (16.0%  and 
UFU (8.7%). However, these institutions have not been the most productive (in terms of academic output 
per researcher). Of the five largest producers of knowledge in Minas Gerais, just UFLA and UFV appear 
as institutions with high productivity. 

The  same  can  be  submitted  to  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  as  was  previously  stated.  The  UFRGS 
accounted  for  31.6%  of  the  scientific  production  of  the  entire  state,  then  UFSM  and  UFPEL,  however, 
among the five most productive institutions of the state, and only UFCSPA and UFPEL stand out. 

Rio de Janeiro is the only state belonging to the  ‘quartet’ that among the five largest institutions 
responsible  for  the  production  of  new  knowledge  in  the  state  appears  a  non  university  which  is 
FIOCRUZ/RJ (responsible for 11.0% of the scientific production in  Rio de Janeiro).However, the other 

13 

 

four positions are occupied by public universities (federal and state funded universities): UFRJ (28.3%), 
UFF (12.8%), UERJ (12.4%) and UFRRJ (5.2%). However, also as with Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do 
Sul,  the  most  productive  institutions  were  not  universities,  but  the  INCA,  CBPF,  EMBRAPA/RJ  and 
IP/JBRJ. It also appears as an institution with high productivity, in Rio de Janeiro, the UENF. 

The  great  contribution  of new knowledge takes  place in  Sao Paulo  from its state universities.  In 
fact,  USP,  UNICAMP  and  UNESP  were  the  main  institutions  in  2010,  followed  by  federally  funded 
institutions UNIFESP and UFSCar. Again, the high productivity does not occur in universities, but in the 
research  centers  HELIOPOLIS,  PAF,  IIEPAE  and  the  LICR.  The  only  educational  institution  that  is 
among  the  five  most  productive  institutions  of  Sao  Paulo  is  the  FAMERP,  Sao  Paulo  state  college  and 
one of the most prestigious schools of medicine and nursing in the country. 

The reasons for the greater dynamism in certain areas of knowledge may be related to two factors, 
according to Faria et al. (2011). The first one relates to the areas of expertise of leading universities and 
science  research  centers  in  Brazil.  Moreover,  the  PRIs,  responsible  for  devolution  for  this  production 
relative to traditional universities, are concentrated in the southeastern states, particularly Sao Paulo and 
Rio  de  Janeiro.  Thus,  in  biological  and  agricultural  sciences,  for  example,  it  is  possible  to  observe  the 
influence of institutions such as EMBRAPA and FIOCRUZ in  scientific production of these states. The 
other factor is the existence of this scientific production in line with that held in developed countries and 
in catching up, where the main areas of scientific expertise are medicine, physics and chemistry. 

 

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 

This  study  allowed  us  to  detail  some  relevant  information  to  a  better  understanding  of  the 
Brazilian  Innovation  System.  The  presentation  of  the  spatial  distribution of  science  production  explains 
particular  structural  features  of  the  Brazilian  NIS,  i.e.,  a  system  whose  knowledge  production  is  highly 
uneven. Only four states can be classified as highly productive (‘scientific quartet’, formed by Sao Paulo, 
Rio  de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais) and they  form  the  epicenter of Brazilian science. 
This conclusion allows us to affirm that the Brazilian NIS is still concentrated in the South-East, although 
there was a small devolution of knowledge production in either direction to less productive states within 
the ‘quartet’, as to the rest of the country. Brazilians are experiencing a recent new wave of infrastructure 
creation of federally funded universities in the country.  

We could also speculate that the above mentioned concentration in the ‘quartet’ is a result of the 
concentration of economic activities in these four states, once they are also economic powerhouses of the 
country. It  would be interesting to check the correlation of science concentration to economic/industrial 
concentration, but this is a further step of this study. 

When analyzing the states that form the ‘scientific quartet’ in Brazil, it was noted that there was a 
reduction in disparities of these states with respect to total scientific production (measured by the volume 
of  scientific  papers  published  in  national  and  international  journals)  by  researcher  and  productivity 
(measured  by  the  volume  of  articles  per  researcher).  Proof  of  this  was  found  constructing  the  T-Theil 
index for both indicators, although inequality in  productivity has been lower than the inequality of total 
production. There was a greater dynamism of researchers of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul vis-à-
vis  the  other  states,  especially  in  certain  areas  of  knowledge  (agricultural,  biological  and  health), 
leveraging the performance of these states. 

Disaggregated  data  by  area  of  knowledge  suggest  an  alignment  of  Brazilian  research  with  the 
international research community, supporting in part the study of Faria et al. (2011), while they are in line 
with the traditions of historical research in the country, as Suzigan and Albuquerque (2008) suggest.  

Although  the  public  universities  still  continue  to  be  the  main  agents  of  production  of  new 
knowledge in the ‘quartet’, they are not the most productive institutions. In other words, researchers from 
PRIs appear as more productive than the university researchers, although more studies on this aspect  are 
needed to identify the reasons and support this result. 

From these findings, we can conclude that  (1) even with federal policies aimed at expanding and 
deconcentrating  production  of  new  scientific  knowledge,  its  production  is  still  strongly  anchored  in  the 
‘quartet’; and (2) the highest growth of national scientific production in the fields of agricultural sciences, 

 

14 

biological  sciences  and  health  sciences,  relates  to  the  scientific  expertise  of  the  states  analyzed  and 
increased scientific productivity of the ‘quartet’, particularly, Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais. 

The hypothesis of the article was confirmed with the data presented, in which the ‘quartet’ is still 
in the top quantile of bibliographic production per researcher. Nevertheless, there was a small devolution7 
regarding the less productive states within the ‘quartet’.  

The first two findings suggest that the effect of decentralization exists, but that there  are gradual 
steps  -  first  within  the  states  of  the  ‘quartet’  and  later  in  other  states.  We  must  take  into  account  that 
federal policies aimed at decentralizing scientific production to other regions of the country tend to have 
an effect over the long term. 

 The  occurrence  of  this  effect  (decentralization  within  the  ‘quartet’)  is  due  to  greater  scientific 
skills  and infrastructure  already present  within the less productive states  of the  ‘quartet’, in  comparison 
with  the  other  states  of  the  country.  It  also  should  be  noted,  as  pointed  by  Barros  (2000),  that  state  or 
regional policies can also affect the distribution of scientific production over time. 

It  was  also  demonstrated  that  the  excellent  performance  of  researchers  of  Minas  Gerais  and  Rio 
Grande do Sul, with respect to their productivity (articles per researcher) takes exactly the most dynamic 
areas of agricultural sciences, biological and health, which increased the average bibliographic production 
of such states. Finally, some of such expertise tend to be in line with the scientific production observed in 
developed  nations,  as  observed  in  biological  and  health  sciences,  taking  the  quartet  as  a  whole.  This  is 
pointed  by  Faria  et  al.  (2011),  and  could  be  due  to  the  greater  participation  of  Brazil  in  international 
scientific  cooperation  in  certain  areas,  such  as  bioprospection,  as  pointed  by  Lima  et  al.  (2007).  This 
Brazilian  participation  is  mainly  represented  by  the  states  of  quartet  and,  therefore,  spots  this  region 
among others in the big web of worldwide co-publications.
