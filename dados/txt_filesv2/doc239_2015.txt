Abstract

Discrimination increases income inequality, which is a major problem in Brazil.

In
this paper we estimate the gender and racial discrimination, using the data from the 2010
Brazilian Censo and the method proposed by Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2009) - reweigh-
ing and recentered inﬂuence function regressions. This method overcomes the limitations
of Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, (see Barsky (2002)), and the decompositions proposed
by Machado and Mata (2005), and Melly (2006). We also estimate the main components
of the discrimination. Our results suggest that wage discrimination between males and fe-
males does not present sharp variations across the quantiles, but the racial discrimination in-
creases along the quantiles of the wage distribution. The decomposition of the unexplained
effects shows that education, experience and region are the most important components
of the racial discrimination. We estimate the discrimination in each of the ﬁve regions of
Brazil, and found evidences that the it is smaller in north and northeast than in other regions.

Introduction

There are many evidences that racial and gender discrimination occurs in the labor market.
Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) performed a ﬁeld experiment, responding to help-wanted
ads in some U.S. newspapers with ﬁctitious resumes. Each resume was assigned either a very
African American sounding name or a very White sounding name. The ﬁctitious people with
white names received 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. Goldin and Rouse (1997)
analyzed the effects of the use of “blind” auditions with a “screen” to conceal the identity of the
candidate from the jury. The screen increased by 50% the probability a woman will be advanced
out of certain preliminary rounds, and greatly increased the probability that a female contestant
will be the winner in the ﬁnal round. In 1970 - prior to the change in the audition policy - less
than 5% of the musicians in the top ﬁve orchestras in the United States were female, in 1997
this share increased to 25%.

These authors succeeded in estimating discrimination in the hiring process. Nevertheless, it
is difﬁcult to estimate the wage discrimination in the labor market. Fortin, Lemieux and Firpo
(2010) review many decomposition methods that can be used to estimate discrimination. They
point out the advantages and limitations of each method. They explain that, at ﬁrst, the decom-
position methods consisted of decompositions of mean wages differentials. Later the methods
evolved and were used to decompose variations, and ﬁnally the conditional distribution. They
also described the reweighting methods, which are non-parametric.

Many authors have estimated the wage discrimination using the method proposed by Oaxaca
(1973) and Blinder (1973). This method approximate the conditional expectations by best linear
predictors. Barsky et al.
(2002) showed that it may yield misleading results when the true
conditional expectation functions are nonlinear.

The decomposition method proposed by Machado and Mata (2005) can be used to evaluate
distributional effects, but these authors provided no econometric theory for the quantile regres-
sion decomposition estimators (Chernozhukov, Fern´andez-Val and Melly, 2012). This method
is computationally demanding, so that if the data sets contains more than a few thousand ob-
servations, it becomes quite cumbersome. Unfortunately, the MM does not provide a way of
performing the detailed decomposition for the composition effect (Fortin, Lemieux and Firpo
(2010)). For example, when the proportion of skilled workers in the economy increases there
is a change in the composition of the the groups of workers, and this change causes a reduc-
tion in the the inequality, and it is called a composition effect. For Fortin, Lemieux and Firpo
(2010), this is a major drawback since the detailed decomposition of the composition effects
into the contribution of each variable is always clearly interpretable. Another drawback of the
MM decomposition is that it is only consistent if the right functional form is used for quan-
tiles. Therefore, this method requires the choice of the right functional form for each and every
quantiles, and making sure that the speciﬁcation is correct is a very difﬁcult empirical exercise.
Melly (2006) estimates the conditional distribution by parametric and nonparametric quan-
tile regressions. The parametric quantile regression is an extension of the Oaxaca/Blinder de-
composition of means to the full distribution. The nonparametric quantile regression is an
efﬁcient local-linear regression estimator for quantile treatment effects. This decomposition
technique has one important limitation, it does not allow for computing detailed decomposi-
tions that allow the computation of the effect of each variable on the unconditional quantile
wage distribution.

Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2009) developed the reweighing and recentered inﬂuence func-
tion regressions, and a decomposition technique that enables the analysis of the contribution
of each explanatory variable after the estimation of the wage structure and composition effects

2

(see Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2007)). Salardi (2012) is the ﬁrst work that used this method
to estimate wage discrimination in Brazil. One limitation of this work is that it fails to give de-
tailed results of the Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2009) decomposition, since it presents results of
a great number of decompositions (besides the standard Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, it also
presents the Brown, Moon and Zoloth (1980), Machado and Mata (2005), and Melly (2006)
decompositions).

The main contribution of this paper is to present detailed results of the decomposition of the
wage gap in Brazil between whites and non-whites, and males and females using the reweigh-
ing and recentered inﬂuence function regressions. We also break down the explained and unex-
plained differences in earnings between these groups into the contribution of each explanatory
variable using a generalized Oaxaca-Blinder method, which do not require the linearity assump-
tion. To our knowledge it is the only work that estimate the discrimination in each of the ﬁve
regions of Brazil, using the method proposed by Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2009). This paper
proceeds as following: the next section describes the method used in this work, the third section
explains the results, the fourth section concludes and the appendix describes the discrimination
in the regions of Brazil.

2 Methods
2.1 Data
The data used in the econometric analysis were obtained from the Brazilian Censo for the year
2010. The sample consists of 200000 observations of males and females between 40 and 49
years of age, with more than 8 years of schooling and positive income. The sample selection was
made according to Angrist, Chernozhukov and Fern´andez-Val(2006). We used the following
variables:

perw individual sampling weights

logw average log weekly wage, calculated as the log of reported monthly income from work

divided by weeks worked

educ years of schooling

black indicator variable for race that assumes the value 1 for blacks, browns and native Amer-

icans, and 0 for whites and yellows.

female indicator variable for gender that assumes the value 1 for females and 0 for males.

reg indicator variable for region that assumes the value 1 for north and northeast, and 0 for

other regions.

sit indicator variable for home location that assumes value 1 for rural location.

waste, construction, vehicle commerce and maintenance, transport, food, communication,
ﬁnance, real state, professional and scientiﬁc, administration and other services, public
administration, education, health and social services, arts and sports, other services, and
domestic services. This last dummy variable is dropped from the model to avoid perfect
multicolinearity (Wooldridge (2009)).

Panel (a) of ﬁgure 1 shows the density of the log of weekly wages of males and females.
We can notice that the distribution of the wages is more right skewed for females than for
males, which indicate the presence of gender discrimination. Analyzing the graphs of the wage
distribution of whites and non-whites, as shown in panel (b) of ﬁgure 1, we can also presume
that there is race discrimination.

In order to estimate and decompose the discrimination, we regress the log of weekly wage
on education, experience, square of experience, female (or race) dummy, region, location and
activity dummies, following the methodology described in the next section. We also estimate
the discrimination in each region, to identify where the discrimination is located, and present
the results in the appendix.

2.2 Reweighing and Recentered Inﬂuence Function Regressions
This section follows the notation from Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2007). Suppose that the
sample of N individuals indexed by i = 1, . . . , N, is divided in two groups, 1 and 0. Therefore
N = N1 + N0, where N1 and N0 are the number of individuals in each group. We denote
the conditional probability that an individual i is in group 1 given X = x, as p(x) = P r[T =
1|X = x]. This conditional probability is sometimes called the “propensity-score”.
The wage depends on some observed variables Xi and on some unobserved variables εi ∈
Rm and is determined by wage structure functions

for t = 0, 1

Yit = gt(Xi, εi),

(1)
We can non-parametrically identify the distributions of Y1|T = 1 ∼d F1 and of Y0|T =
0 ∼d F0, from observed data on (Y, T, X). But we need more assumptions to identify the coun-
terfactual distribution of Y0|T = 1 ∼d FC . The counterfactual distribution FC is the one that
would have prevailed under the wage structure of group 0, but with the distribution of observed
and unobserved characteristics of group 1. Consider these three distributions conditional on X:
Y1|X, T = 1 ∼d F1|X, Y0|X, T = 0 ∼d F0|X and Y0|X, T = 1 ∼d FC|X.
Let ν1,ν0 and νC be a functional (variance, median, quantile, Gini, etc.) of the conditional
joint distribution of (Y1, Y0)|T , and F ν is a class of distribution functions such that F ∈ F ν
if ||ν(F )|| < +∞. The difference in the ν’s between the two groups is the difference in wages
measured in terms of the distributional statistic ν, and is called the ν-overall wage gap.

O = ν(F1) − ν(F0) = ν1 − ν0

We can decompose equation (2) in two parts, using the fact that X can be unevenly dis-

tributed across groups, then

S corresponds to the effect on ν of a change from g1(·,·) to g0(·,·)
keeping the distribution of (X, ε)|T = 1 constant. This is called the wage structure effect or
the unexplained difference effect. With no other restrictions, the second term ∆ν
X corresponds
to the effect of changes in distribution from the one of (X, ε)|T = 1 to that of (X, ε)|T = 0,
keeping the “wage structure” g0(·,··· ) constant. This is called the composition effect or the
explained difference effect.

Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2007) use the reweighing and recentered inﬂuence function re-
gressions to analyze how polarization of U.S. male wages that took place between the late 1980s
and the mid 2000s was affected by factors such as de-unionization, education, occupations and
industry changes. Given the total change in the distribution of wages ∆ν
O, they tried to answer
two questions. The ﬁrst was, what is the change in the distribution of wages between the late
1980s the mid 2000s, that are associated with the change in the wage structure (∆ν
S or “wage
structure”), if worker characteristics were the same in the two periods. The second was, what is
the change in the distribution of wages in these two periods, that are associated with the change
in worker characteristics (∆ν

X or “composition effect”), keeping the wage structure constant.

Here we need the conditional independence assumption, that is, we assume that ε is inde-
pendent of T given X. This implies that ∆ν
X only reﬂect changes in the distribution X. This
assumption is also crucial for identiﬁcation of FC and εC. We do not need any assumption about
the format of g0(·,·) and g0(·,·), but if we had imposed some assumption on the format of these
function then we could have relaxed the conditional independence assumption. In the Oaxaca-
Blinder decomposition it is assumed that g1(X, ε) = X T β1 + 1, g0(X, ε0) = X T β0 + 0, and
that

E[t|X, T = t] = 0

(4)
The assumption that the functions g1(·,·) and g0(·,·) are linear can be plausible in many
cases, but the assumption of exogeneity described by equation (4), is more difﬁcult to be ac-
cepted, since if any variable that affects wages (like ability) is missing in the model, we cannot
afﬁrm that this assumption is valid.

We can identify the parameters of interest under the common assumptions of Ignorability
(sometimes called unconfoundedness) and Overlapping Support (or Common Support). The
Ignorability assumption should be analyzed in each speciﬁc case, as it is more plausible in
some cases than in others. In our speciﬁc case, it states that the distribution of the unobserved
explanatory factors in the wage determination is the same across groups 1 and 0, once we
condition on a vector of observed components. Formally, the Ignorability assumption is: Let
(L, X, ε) have a joint distribution. For all x in X , ε is independent of T given X = x.

The Overlapping Support assumption requires that there be an overlap in observable char-
acteristics across groups, in the sense that there no value of x in X such that it is only observed
among individuals in group 1.
In gender wage gap decompositions where some of the de-
tailed occupations are only held by men or by women, this assumption is not valid, but in our
case the we consider only 21 sectors (or types of occupation), therefore the Overlaping Sup-
port assumption is plausible. Formally, the Overlaping Support assumption is: For all x in X ,
p(x) = P r[T = 1|X = x] < 1. Futhermore, P r[T = 1] > 0.

2.2.1 Step 1: Reweighing

The distributions F0,F1 and FC can be estimated non-parametrically using the weights:

p
where p(X) = P r[T = 1|X = x] is the proportion of people in the combined population of
two groups that is in group 1, given that those people have X = x, and p is the unconditional
probability. ω1(T ) and ω0(T ) transform features of the marginal distribution of Y into features
of the conditional distribution of Y1 given T = 1, and of Y0 given T = 0, respectively. ωC(T )
transforms features of the marginal distribution of Y into features of the counterfactual distri-
bution of Y0 given T = 1. By identifying FC we can identify the functional ν(FC) (variance,
median, quantile, Gini, etc.), and from equations (2) and (3) we can identify and ∆ν
S and ∆ν
X.
The following result permits us to identify FC.

By weighing the observations with the inverse probabilities of belonging to group 0 or 1 given

S = 0

X = 0

Part b of Theorem 2 states that when there are no group differences in the wage determina-
tion functions, then we should ﬁnd no wage structure effects (unexplained effects), while part c
states that if there are no group differences in the distribution of the covariates, there will be no
composition effects.

We now explain how to estimate the weighting functions. The distributional statistics ν1,
ν0 and νC can be computed directly from the appropriately reweighted samples. The three
weighting functions we are interested in are ω1(T ), ω0(T ), and ωC(T, X). The ﬁrst two weights
are are estimated by:

the parametric and the non-parametric approaches to estimate this probability, see Firpo, Fortin

Another way to get estimates of a distribution statistic ˆν is to use standard software pro-
grams, to compute distributional statistics directly from the observations on Y, weighted using
the appropriate weighting factor. We estimate the composition and the wage structure effects
by using the estimated distributional statistics as ˆ∆ν

X = ˆνC − ˆν0.
In this paper we use quantiles as distributional measures for the decomposition of wage
distributions.
In decompositions of the gender wage gap, they are used to differentiate the
(cid:80)N
effects of the discrimination in the middle of the distribution from its impact in the tails. To carry
out the decomposition of the median, we ﬁrst estimate met, t = 0, 1 and meC by reweighting
i=1 ˆωC(Ti)·|Yi − q|.

2.2.2 Step 2: Application of the UQR methodology

Let ν = ν(F ) be a general functional. The inﬂuence function is

, where F(y) = (1 − )F + δy, 0 ≤  ≤ 1, and where δy is a distribution that only puts mass

−∞ IF (y; ν, F )dF (y) = 0.

We use a recentered inﬂuence function: RIF (y; ν, F ) = ν(F ) + IF (y; ν, F ) whose expec-

tation is the original ν:

The τ-th quantile of the distribution F is deﬁned as the functional qτ = Q(F, τ ) = inf{y|F (y) >

τ}, and its inﬂuence function is:

IF (y; qτ ) =

τ − 1{y ≤ qτ}

fy(qτ )

The rescaled inﬂuence function of the τ-th quantile is

RIF (y; qτ ) = qτ + IF (y; qτ ) = qτ +

τ − 1{y ≤ qτ}

fy(qτ )

The inﬂuence function of the median is,

In order to estimate the linear RIF-regressions, we compute the rescaled inﬂuence function
for each observation by plugging the sample estimate of the median, ˆme , and estimating the
density at the sample median, ˆf ( ˆme). For the median of Y1|T = 1, we would use

(cid:91)RIF (y; me1) = ˆme1 +

where ˆf1(·) is a consistent estimator for the density of Y1|T = 1, f1(·). Kernel methods can
be used to estimate the density. We use the guaussian kernel function with halfwidth of ker-
nel equals to 0.06. The RIF-regressions are then estimated by replacing the usual dependent
variable, Y , by the estimated value of RIF (y; me1). The resulting regression coefﬁcients are

3 Results

In this section we show the decomposition of the wage gap between males and females, and
whites and non-whites in Brazil. We decompose the wage differentials in explained and un-
explained effects. The unexplained effects give an estimate of the discrimination. The ﬁgures
show the decomposition of the wage differentials from the 5th until the 95th quantile of the
wage distribution, and the estimates are made for each ﬁve quantiles in this range.

Panel a of ﬁgure 2 displays the total wage differential between males and females, the ex-
plained effect and the unexplained effects. The wage discrimination between males and females
does not present sharp variations across the quantiles of the wage distribution. It is greater in
the 5th and the 35th quantiles. Table 1 displays the wage gap decomposition and the decom-
position of the unexplained effects for selected quantiles of the wage distribution. As we use
log of weekly wage as the depend variable of our estimation, all values are in log of weekly
wages. As we can see in this table, the gender discrimination varies around its mean value of
0.04 across the quantiles.

Panel b of ﬁgure 2 displays the decomposition of the unexplained effects. Activity is the
greater component of the unexplained differences. This means that there are activities in which
women receive smaller wages than men. These results suggest that the gender discrimination
is not generalized to all activities, for if it were true, the activity would not be a important
component of the unexplained effects. If, for example, education were the main component of
the discrimination, then we would conclude that in general women with the same educational
level than men would receive a smaller wage.

These results differ from Salardi (2012), who found evidences that education is the primary
contributor to differences in endowments, and that experience is an important contributor to the
unexplained wage gap between male and female and white and non-white workers, using the
RIF-OLS technique developed by Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2009). Bartalotti (2007), using
the Machado-Mata decomposition, found evidences that the gender discrimination in Brazil
increases smoothly from the lower quantiles until the 85th, and it increases sharply thereafter.
Our results suggest that the gender discrimination in Brazil in greater in the 35th quantile,
presents some sharp variations in the lower quantiles, and decreases in the upper quantiles.

Figure 3 is similar to ﬁgure 2, and presents the estimates of the race discrimination. Panel b
of ﬁgure 3 shows that race discrimination increases along the quantiles of the wage distribution
and it is greater than gender discrimination. The total wage gap also is greater between whites
and non-whites than between males and females, and this is more evident in the upper quantiles.
Table 1 shows that the total wage gap is −0.062 in the 10th quantile, and increases to 0.212 in
the 90th quantile.

Our results are similar to those found by ´Alvarez (2013), who analyzed the race wage gap
in Brazil using the Melly (2006) decomposition, and data from the PNAD for the years 2001
and 2011. The graphs of the race wage gap and discrimination have a U-shape (specially in
2011), with the minimum point located at the 20th quantile, but the discrimination increases
in the upper quantiles. He found that the explained and the unexplained effects were roughly
equal, therefore approximately half of the wage gap occurs because of race discrimination.

The decomposition of the unexplained effects is displayed in panel b of ﬁgure 3. Education,
experience and region are the most important components of the race discrimination. Educa-
tion and experience become more important, while region becomes less important in the upper
quantiles. Table 1 shows that in the 10th quantile the components of the discrimination are very
similar, but education, experience and region stand out in the quantiles above the 50th quantile.
These results imply that the non-whites which are on the higher quantiles of the wage dis-

tribution have a smaller return to education than the whites. Region is a important component
of the discrimination, therefore in some regions the discrimination is greater than in others. The
region dummy is 1 for north and northeast and 0 for other regions, and these two regions have
a great portion of non-whites. Thus it is likely that the discrimination is smaller in north and
northeast than in the other regions, where non-whites are minority. To verify this, we estimate
the gender and race discrimination for each of the ﬁve regions of Brazil. The results are shown
in ﬁgures 4 and 5 in the appendix. Figure 4 shows that gender discrimination is very small
in north and northeast regions, and it is greater in the other regions. Figure 5 shows that race
discrimination is smaller in north and northeast than in other regions, but in this two regions
race discrimination is greater than gender discrimination.

4 Conclusions

In this paper we decomposed the wage gap in Brazil between whites and non-whites, and males
and females using the reweighing and recentered inﬂuence function regressions. The wage

13

discrimination between males and females does not present sharp variations across the quantiles
of the wage distribution. It is greater in the 5th and the 35th quantiles. Our results suggest that
gender discrimination is not generalized to all activities, since activity is the main component
of the unexplained effects. We also found evidences that gender discrimination is very small in
north and northeast regions, and it is greater in the other regions.

The racial discrimination increases along the quantiles of the wage distribution and it is
greater than gender discrimination. The decomposition of the unexplained effects shows that
education, experience and region are the most important components of the race discrimination.
This means that whites have a greater return to education and experience than non-whites, and
that the discrimination is greater in some regions than in others. The estimation of the racial
discrimination for each of the ﬁve regions of Brazil shows that race discrimination is smaller
in north and northeast than in other regions. This occurs because non-whites are minority in
south, southeast and midwest, therefore it is more likely that the discrimination is greater in
these regions than in north and northeast.

One limitation of this paper is that it does not identify the activities where gender and race
discrimination occurs. Another limitation is that it does not discuss the problem of sensitivity
to the choice of omitted baseline category (see Oaxaca and Ransom (1999)). To avoid perfect
multicollinearity, one of the dummy variables is omitted in the regression equation. This vari-
able represents the baseline category, for the coefﬁcients of the remaining dummy variables are
interpreted as deviations from this variable. The results of the Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions
are sensitive to the researcher’s choice of the omitted baseline category. Although, this paper
fails to analyze this problem, it is possible that this problem occurs because of the linearity
assumption of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, and this assumption is not required in our
estimates, therefore it is not necessary the perform the adjustment proposed by Gardeazabal
and Ugidos (2004).

Brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world. Racial and gender discrimination
may be important factors contributing to this inequality. Although some policies are being
created to reduce the inequality of opportunity - in 2004 the Universidade Federal de Bras´ılia
was the ﬁrst public university to adopt a quota system to increase the number of non-whites
students - there are many more actions to be implemented to reduce the discrimination and
inequality that are present in every region of this country. Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003)
argue that training alone may not be enough to alleviate the barriers raised by discrimination,
since blacks living in the U.S. with the same qualiﬁcation as whites, have a lesser probability
of receiving callbacks for interviews, after responding to help-wanted ads. We hope that the
insights on the subject provided by this paper may stir up the debate about discrimination, and
that in a near future, non-whites may have the same access as whites to education, job interviews
and receive the same return to education and experience.
