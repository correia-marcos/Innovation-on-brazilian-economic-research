Resumo:  O  objetivo  deste  artigo  é  explorar  um  paralelismo  entre  dois  episódios  da  história  do 
pensamento econômico, a fim de sugerir que interações entre as duas literaturas podem contribuir para a 
pesquisa sobre os modelos Kaleckianos de crescimento e distribuição. Primeiro, é realizado um breve 
resumo do desenvolvimento teórico a partir do estagnacionismo de Steindl até o debate sobre regimes de 
demanda.  Segue-se  uma  descrição  mais  detalhada  do  debate  que  começa  com  o  estagnacionismo  de 
Furtado  e  resulta  na  formulação  de  modelos  de  articulação  e  desarticulação  social.  Finalmente,  uma 
classificação  analítica  dos  modelos  de  crescimento  e  distribuição  Kaleckianos  e  latino-americanos  é 
oferecida, indicando uma forma em que a heterogeneidade setorial e a composição da demanda podem 
agir como um elo plausível entre o crescimento e a distribuição.

This paper has as its starting point two episodes in the history of economic thought that show an 
interesting parallelism. Both of them began with forecasts that ended up being unambiguously inaccurate. 
More  concretely,  they  were  both  initiated  by  claims  that  economic  growth  had  its  days  counted  and 
stagnation was unavoidable. Ironically, these claims were made in the run-up to periods of extraordinarily 
high  growth.  However,  these  failed  predictions  pointed  towards  some  illuminating  characteristics  of 
capitalist economies that would be the basis of later theoretical elaborations, which succeeded in keeping 
the useful insights while shedding away the mistaken forecast. 
The first of these episodes is well known. It began with Josef Steindl’s (1952/1976) stagnationist 
argument and eventually led to the debate on demand and growth regimes, based on Kaleckian growth 
and distribution models (see Blecker, 2002, for a summary). The second, relatively more obscure, is a 
Latin  American  version  of  the  first  one.  It  began  with  stagnationist  views  of  the  prospects  of  Latin 
American  development  (see,  for  instance,  Furtado,  1965),  was  followed  by  a  revisionist  attempt  to 
interpret  the  failed  prediction  (most  famously  by  Tavares  and  Serra,  1971/1976)  and  resulted  in  the 
formulation of models of social articulation or disarticulation, that is, of cumulative processes involving 
growth and inequality (Taylor and Bacha, 1976, De Janvry and Sadoulet, 1983)1. 
By exploring this parallelism, this paper aims to provide a classification of Kaleckian and Latin 
American  growth  and  distribution  models  that  goes  beyond  the  one  based  on  a  conventional 
understanding of the demand and distributive schedules (Taylor, 2010: 188). Examining the way in which 
sectoral heterogeneity can be incorporated in this framework and the cumulative processes that it may 
generate, this analysis points towards an additional mechanism connecting growth and distribution that 
may be important to interpret particular historical developments, but that is largely overlooked by the 
Kaleckian  literature,  despite  notable  exceptions  (Taylor,  1989;  Dutt,  1990:  chaps.  6-7).  Even  if 
abstracting from these issues might be adequate in certain cases, a reinterpretation of the demand and 
distributive  schedules  that  incorporates  sectoral  heterogeneity  (both  in  the  production  and  in  the

dynamic interaction between growth and distribution.  
 
1. From stagnationist claims to demand regimes: the Kaleckian thread 
 
 
With hindsight, it seems incredible that in the aftermath of World War II there was widespread 
concern with a potential economic stagnation of the rich countries (or “mature economies,” as they were 
then called). After all, the following two decades would be characterized by an extraordinary prosperity 
and would be called the “golden age” of capitalism (Armstrong et al., 1984/1991). But the economic 
troubles that plagued Europe after World War I were still too recent to be ignored and averting their 
repetition was a widely shared objective. 
 
Steindl’s  (1952/1976)  Maturity  and  Stagnation  in  American  Capitalism  is  a  product  of  this 
context.  Its  characterization  of  postwar  capitalism  did  not  sink  into  oblivion,  in  spite  of  the  ensuing 
“golden age,” surviving in a branch of Marxism initiated by Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy’s Monopoly 
Capital (1966). Steindl’s argument is the postwar version of a much older underconsumptionist tradition. 
According  to  him,  in  a  competitive  economy,  if  the  growth  rate  and  capacity  utilization  decreased, 
competitive  pressure  would  ensure  that  the  less  efficient  producers  would  be  eliminated  by  the  more 
efficient ones in a price war that tended to diminish the average profit margins (Steindl, 1979: 5-8). These 
reduced margins would, in their turn, stimulate the resumption of growth and the recovery of the capacity 
utilization  ratio.  However,  in  an  oligopolistic  economy  this  stabilization  mechanism  would  no  longer 
work,  because  profit  margins  become  rigid,  and  a  deceleration  of  growth  would  not  face  any 
countervailing  force.  As  a  result,  stagnation  could  become  permanent.  But  why  does  increasing 
concentration make the profit margins rigid? In Steindl’s (1979: 7) words, in an oligopolistic economy 
“aggressive  price  strategies  become  very  risky,  because  the  few  main  producers  all  have  substantial 
margins, and to drive out one of them would require a ruinous price war. If the growth rate declines, the 
oligopolists are therefore more prepared in most cases to accept low long-term rates of utilization than to 
engage in cut-throat competition.”2 
Commenting  Steindl’s  and  Baran  and  Sweezy’s  arguments,  Robert  Brenner  (1998/2006:  54) 
claims that “[t]he notions of ‘monopoly capital’ and ‘capitalist stagnation’ soon revealed themselves (…) 
to be reification of quite temporary and specific aspects of the economy of the US in the 1950s.” Steindl 
(1979: 8-13) himself had defended his argument against this kind of criticism, claiming that the growth 
rates observed in the 1950s and 1960s did not contradict his interpretation, since they could be explained 
by resorting to other factors. And, since the 1970s, the tendency towards stagnation could once more be 
clearly identified, according to him. 
 
Relatively apart from this controversy, in the early 1980s the Kaleckian framework that was the 
basis for Steindl’s argument would be combined with an adaptation of Steindl’s own ideas about capacity 
utilization and the investment function to formulate the early versions of what is now called Kaleckian 
growth  and  distribution  models  (Rowthorn,  1981,  Dutt,  1984,  Taylor,  1985)3.  The  objective  was  no 
longer to provide an epochal diagnosis of capitalism, but rather to give a mathematical representation of 
the relationship between growth and the functional distribution of income, that might be useful to throw 
light  on  concrete  economic  developments  (Amitava  Dutt’s  paper  addresses  an  episode  of  economic 
deceleration in India, for instance). Moreover, while Kalecki and Steindl put a lot of emphasis on the 
theoretical understanding of cyclical dynamics, the 1980s literature was based on more simple steady 
state analyses. 
Lance  Taylor  (1985)  called  his  model  “stagnationist,”  but  the  label  was  only  a  sign  of  its 
Steindlian heritage. The model did result in a positive relation between the wage share and aggregate 
demand, but he did not argue that there was a secular tendency to a reduction of the wage share and, as a 
result, to stagnation, in contrast to Steindl. This positive relation had an affinity with social democrat and

Keynesian inclinations to argue for the compatibility between growth and income redistribution4. But, in 
the mid-1980s, with the neoliberal backlash under way, these ideas were losing favor. 
A few years later, Amit Bhaduri and Stephen Marglin (1990) used a more general model to show 
that the mentioned positive relation was just one possibility among others (something that had also been 
suggested by Robert Blecker, 1989). The novelty of Bhaduri and Marglin’s work was not to show that 
there could be an inverse relationship between the wage share and growth, since this was a common view, 
shared by most classical economists and by the Cambridge Keynesians. Their contribution was simply to 
demonstrate that it could also be derived from the Kalecki-Steindl framework, if investment was assumed 
to respond to the profit share instead of the profit rate5. Similarly, Blecker (1989) showed that the inverse 
relationship could also come about if the effect of international competition on the mark-up was taken 
into  consideration.  Bhaduri  and  Marglin  (1990:184)  were  explicit  about  the  politics  behind  their 
argument: 

“The social democrats and their academic allies, the Left Keynesians, put forward the political 
and intellectual case for the view that high capacity utilization would resolve the contradiction 
between high wages and high profits. Emphasizing the demand side, neglecting the cost side, 
they  believed  that  high  wages  would  contribute  not  only  to  high  levels  of  output  and 
employment  but  also  to  high  levels  of  profits  and  accumulation.  (…)  the  co-operative 
interpretation of Keynes became increasingly inconsistent with facts.” 
 
Their formulation, thus, included two cases: one with the positive relation between the wage share 
and aggregate demand and the other with a negative relation6. They called the former the “stagnationist” 
case, following Taylor, and named the latter the “exhilarationist” one. At this point, these terms were not 
at all illuminating. In a survey from 2002, Robert Blecker (2002: 148, fn. 17) felt he had to clarify that “a 
stagnationist  economy  need  not  actually  be  stagnant.  Stagnationism  is  simply  the  case  of  wage-led 
aggregate demand, in which an increased profit share depresses aggregate demand, but an increased wage 
share boosts it.” The phrases slowly fell out of favor and currently the most common designation for the 
two cases is simply wage-led and profit-led demand. 
With Bhaduri, Marglin and Blecker, then, the theoretical impulse that began with Steindl was able 
 
to leave behind the stagnationist stance and transform itself into a more comprehensive framework to 
examine the interactions between demand and distribution in a capitalist economy7. This development 
might be understood, following Marglin and Bhaduri (1990: 155), by resorting to the “distinction between 
a theory of a capitalist economy in which aggregate demand plays a central role, and models built on 
particular assumptions about the components of aggregate demand.” And they apply this distinction to the 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
5 Formally, Bhaduri and Marglin’s (1990: 380) investment function can be represented as 𝑔!=𝛼+𝛽𝜋+𝛾𝑢, in which 𝜋 and 𝑢 
denote, respectively, the profit share and the utilization ratio, while 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝛾 are parameters. Dutt’s (1984: 28) investment 
function, in its turn, can be represented as 𝑔!=𝛼+𝛽𝑟+𝛾𝑢=𝛼+𝛽𝜋𝑢+𝛾𝑢, in which 𝑟 stands for the profit rate, which is 
represented as 𝜋𝑢. 

4 According to some of these models, not only growth and redistribution were compatible, but also both classes could benefit 
from redistribution, given that an increase in the wage share, through its effect on capacity utilization, could raise the profit 
rate. This case was called the cooperative wage-led demand regime. The models also allowed for the conflictive case, however. 
See Bhaduri and Marglin (1990: 388-390) and Blecker (2002: table 8.1) for this taxonomy.

6 In fact, the taxonomy can be extended to distinguish between conflictive and cooperative cases of both wage-led and profit-
led demand regimes. Another distinction that has been made is the one between wage-led and profit-led accumulation. See 
Bhaduri and Marglin (1990: 388-390) and Blecker (2002: table 8.1). 
7 Paulo dos Santos (2015: 663) has recently provided a negative assessment of the theoretical development from Steindl to the 
Kaleckian  models,  considering  the  work  of  the  former  as  one  among  many  “integrated  theorizations  of  the  secular 
development  of  capitalism,  and  the  endogenous  contradictions  it  may  face”,  whereas  the  latter  are  called  “more  partial 
discussions.” The contrasting positive assessment offered above assumes that the Kaleckian models should not be considered 
in isolation, but could lead to more sophisticated theorizations of the development of capitalism if they are combined with a 
historical diagnosis of the latter. The collective book edited by Marglin and Schor (1990), combining history and theory, can 
be read along these lines. As Marglin (1990: 3) puts it in his introduction: “the historical chapters set the stage for and frame 
the theoretical chapters, and the theory illuminates and focuses history.”

higher  incomes,  which  increases  aggregate  savings  given  constant  saving  propensities).  From  this 
equilibrium,  it  is  straightforward  to  define  the  impact  of  a  change  in  distribution  on  the  level  of 
utilization: 

literature in question: “we view the Keynesian insistence on aggregate demand as an important ingredient 
to understanding how modern capitalism works quite generally, but the stagnationist model as very much 
bound to particular places and times.”8 
 
A simple formal representation of the Kaleckian models might be useful to the present argument9. 
Following Michalis Nikiforos and Duncan Foley (2012: 202-204), the demand schedule is derived from 
the  equivalence  between  aggregate  investment  and  aggregate  savings,  considering  both  of  them  as 

functions of income distribution and of the level of capacity utilization, 𝑢: 
 𝐼𝜓,𝑢 =𝑆𝜓,𝑢   
where 𝜓 is the wage share of income. By assumption, 𝐼! is negative (the subscript refers to the partial 
derivative),  assuming  that  investment  is  a  positive  function  of  the  profit  share,  and 𝐼! is  positive, 
representing an accelerator effect. 𝑆!, in its turn, is assumed to be negative, given the assumption that 
capitalists have a higher propensity to save than workers, and 𝑆! is positive (higher utilization results in

be profit-led. This is a very simple framework and numerous extensions have been suggested, which 
incorporate taxation, household credit, open economy considerations, technical change, personal income 
inequality, among other things (see the summaries provided by Blecker, 2002, and Lavoie, 2014: chaps. 
5-7). 
From the beginning, the demand schedule was examined in conjunction with what is now called 

 
The denominator of (2) is usually considered to be negative, supposing that saving responds more 
strongly  than  investment  to  changes  in  utilization.  This  assumption  is  named  the  Keynesian  stability 
condition. The demand regime, then, depends on the sign of the numerator. If an increase in the wage 
share reduces savings more than it reduces investment, the numerator will be positive and the demand 

204-207,  Taylor,  2004:  chap.  7).  Dutt’s  (1984)  original  contribution,  for  instance,  interpreted  the 
distributive  schedule  as  a  result  of  the  impact  of  growth  on  the  industrial  structure  and,  through  this 
channel, on the mark-up. In this case, there was explicit consideration about the time horizon of each 
adjustment, the commodity market represented by the demand schedule reaching equilibrium quickly and 
the  industrial  structure  (represented  by  the  distributive  schedule)  changing  slowly.  Alternatively,  the 
distributive schedule could be interpreted as determined by the labor market, in line with Goodwin’s 
(1967)  formalization  of  Marx’s  argument,  for  instance  (different  interpretations  of  the  distributive 
schedule are discussed in Nikiforos and Foley, 2012: 204-207). For the purposes of the present paper, that 
is, the comparison between the Kaleckian and the Latin American literatures, it is convenient to avoid the 
issue of distinct time horizons and to keep in mind that the distributive schedule can represent different 
theoretical formulations about the dynamic of the functional distribution of income. 
Before moving to the Latin American episode, it is important to mention a relatively unknown 
extension of the Kaleckian framework that is particularly relevant to the present argument. It consists in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 A referee suggested that an alternative way to interpret this development would be distinguishing between Steindl’s story of 
stagnation and the Kaleckian theory of growth and distribution, with its many different models. In my view, these two sets of 
distinctions can complement each other. 
9 The option of resorting to Nikiforos and Foley’s (2012) version of the framework is justified by its simplicity and generality, 
despite  the  fact  that,  by  putting  the  demand  and  the  distributive  schedules  together,  it  distances  itself  from  the  original 
contributions to this literature, which tended to assume that demand adjusts more rapidly than distribution.

an attempt by Taylor (1983: 170-176; 1989) to examine the Kaleckian results in a two-sector model, 
separating  the  production  of  wage-goods,  on  the  one  hand,  and  of  luxury-  and  capital-goods,  on  the 
other10. He assumes a common wage for both sectors, zero saving by the workers and no consumption of 
wage-goods by capitalists. Workers, in their turn, consume both wage- and luxury-goods. Interestingly, 
the  impact  of  an  exogenous  shift  of  demand  towards  wage-goods  on  income  distribution  and  growth 
depend on which sector is more labor intensive and on the sectoral profit-rate-elasticity of investment. If, 
for instance, the sector producing wage-goods were more labor-intensive (what is “by no means obvious 
empirically”,  according  to  Taylor,  1989:  632),  a  shift  of  demand  towards  it  would  shift  income 
distribution towards wages, both in the short run and in the steady state. But this would come at the cost 
of a lower steady-state growth rate, if the response of the other sector’s investment to its profit rate were 
higher.  A  demand  shift  towards  wage-goods  would  only  improve  distribution  and,  at  the  same  time, 
accelerate  growth  if  the  sector  producing  wage-goods  were  more  labor-intensive  and  its  investment 
responded more strongly to its profit rate than the other sector’s investment responded to its profit rate. 
This model shows that, by incorporating structural heterogeneity, one can add another dimension 
to the relation between growth and distribution. The shift in demand composition can be interpreted as a 
shift in the distributive schedule11, indicating that composition effects can be important to explain the 
dynamics of the aggregate labor market or of the aggregate industrial structure that underlie the trajectory 
of the functional income distribution. In the case at hand, supposing that the sector producing wage-goods 
is more labor intensive, a shift in demand towards it results in a lower average mark-up, entirely due to 
the change in the sectoral composition of output. It is precisely these composition effects that will play a 
leading role in the Latin American literature, to which we now turn. 
 
2. From estancamiento to the unequalizing spiral: the Latin American version 
 
 
The concern about stagnation arrived in Latin America about a decade and half after it thrived in 
the rich countries. The context was a bit different. The aftermath of the war was characterized by bold 
attempts to accelerate development through industrialization in many Latin American countries. It was a 
period  of  rich  experimentation  with  development  policies,  while  at  the  same  time  the  field  of 
development  economics  attained  centrality  in  academia.  In  Arndt’s  (1987:  44)  words,  development 
economics  was  “promoted  (…)  from  the  most  neglected  to  the  most  written-about  branch  of  the 
discipline” and an important part of it was being formulated within Latin America, by the intellectuals 
gathered  around  the  United  Nations’  Economic  Commission  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean 
(ECLAC or, for the locals, CEPAL). 
 
This euphoria lasted only until the mid-1960s, when these countries caught up with the fears (if 
not with the per capita income) of its richer counterparts. In 1968, Albert Hirschman claimed there was 
considerable  “disenchantment”  with  industrialization  in  Latin  America.  Prominently  among  the 
disenchanted was Celso Furtado (1965), the Brazilian economist who had been a major contributor to the 
development literature and who had at the same time been actively engaged in policy-making in Brazil. 
The timing of the gloomy prospects is ironic, as it had been with Steindl’s. Brazil would go through, from 
the late 1960s to the early 1970s, what has been called its “milagre econômico” (economic miracle), a 
period  of  very  high  rates  of  growth,  even  if  also  characterized  by  rapidly  increasing  inequality  and 
dramatic political repression. 
 
Hirschman (1981: 20-22) would later interpret this stagnationism in political and psychological 
terms.  The  1960s  were  characterized  by  a  series  of  “political  disasters”,  as  he  calls  them,  in  Latin 
America, which shattered the hopes of “a groups of social scientists, who, after all, had taken up the 
cultivation  of  development  economics  in  the  wake  of  World  War  II  not  as  narrow  specialists,  but 
impelled  by  the  vision  of  a  better  world.”  (1981:  20)  Furtado  himself  was  a  victim  of  one  of  these 
“political disasters,” being forced into exile by the Brazilian civil-military dictatorship, after the 1964

distinguish between shifts in the distributive schedule and shifts in the demand schedule.

coup.  Hirschman  (1981:  21-22)  goes  on:  “In  a  Freudian  act  of  displacement,  they  [the  development 
economists] ‘took out’ their distress over the political side on the weaker aspects of the economic record. 
(…) Now that political developments had takes a resoundingly wrong turn, one had to prove that the 
economic  story  was  similarly  unattractive.”  A  positive  consequence  of  this  change  of  mood  was  to 
stimulate  a  more  critical  look  at  the  process  of  development,  examining  for  instance  its  impact  on 
inequality12. But it also led to a forecast of stagnation that would turn out to be incorrect. 
 
Furtado’s (1965) version of stagnationism was a historically-informed interpretation of capitalist 
development in Latin America13. Its starting point was the existence of a large subsistence economy that 
acted as a reservoir of labor for the capitalist sector. The development of the latter would be shaped by a 
supply of labor that was virtually unlimited, which kept constant the real wage paid by capitalist firms, at 
a  level  just  above  the  living  standards  allowed  by  the  subsistence  economy.14 This  feature  entailed  a 
polarization  of  the  consumption  market,  characterized,  on  the  one  side,  by  a  growing  contingent  of 
workers receiving low wages and enjoying a stagnant living standard and, on the other, by a small elite 
with rapidly increasing income (mostly appropriated as profits in the capitalist sector) and increasingly 
diversified consumption patterns. In other words, development was accompanied by high and increasing 
inequality. In this way, the dualism of the economy, divided between subsistence and capitalist sectors, 
was reflected in a dualism of the consumption market. And in Furtado’s (1965: 166) words, “the concept 
of underdevelopment is related to the idea of structural dualism.” 
 
Furtado examines the impact of these features on the process of development by dividing it into 
three phases, in an admittedly schematic periodization of Latin American economic history (see Furtado 
and Maneschi, 1968: 6-7). The first one, which lasted from the last quarter of the 19th century until the 
Great Depression, was marked by high rates of growth of the exports of primary goods. The second 
resulted from the sudden reduction of the world demand for these products and the ensuing deterioration 
of  the  terms  of  trade,  which  led  to  import-substitution  industrialization  focused  primarily  on  the 
development  of  a  sector  for  producing  nondurable  consumption  goods.  The  third  phase,  in  its  turn, 
represents a shift of focus of industrialization towards capital-intensive sectors, such as the production of 
durable and capital goods. 
 
The polarization of the consumption market mentioned above contributes to bringing about the 
transition from the second to the third phase. Given the stagnant incomes of the majority of the workers 
employed  in  the  capitalist  sector  the  scope  for  the  expansion  of  the  nondurable  goods  industry  is 
relatively limited. At the same time, the increasing incomes of the rich create a growing demand for 
luxury goods, such as durable ones. This shift, in Furtado’s reading, results in a reduction of the output-
capital ratio, given that the choice of technique in underdeveloped countries is quite limited and is not 
influenced by the relative scarcity of the factors of production. In spite of the unlimited supply of labor, 
capital-intensive techniques characterize the production of durable and capital goods simply because this 
is the only technology available for their production, a technology imported from the developed countries. 
When these products were originally created in the developed countries, the technology used in their 
production reflected the fact that there was no longer abundance of labor in them (Furtado, 1975: 281-
283). 
 
It is against this background, of the interactions between structural dualism, income distribution, 
consumption  patterns,  and  the  productive  structure,  that  Furtado  analyzes  the  tendency  towards 
stagnation. His view of the growth process, though nuanced, is a supply-led one, in contrast to Kalecki’s

volume edited by Tolipan and Tinelli (1975). For a summary in English, see Bacha and Taylor (1978). 
13 The following brief reconstruction of Furtado’s argument will be based mainly on Furtado (1965), Furtado and Maneschi 
(1968), and Furtado (1975: esp. chap. 21). See also Furtado (1966), where a Portuguese version of Furtado (1965) can be 
found together with a broader argument. It is true that Furtado’s thought went through some changes between 1965 and 1975, 
but here the focus will be on its continuities. An analysis of the changes, in light of the contemporary debate and the actual 
development of capitalism in Brazil, would be a fruitful theme for future research.  
14 The identification of surplus labor as one of the main characteristics of underdeveloped countries was widespread in the 
literature of the time. Its effects were more comprehensively explored in the work of Lewis (1954, 1958). See also Hirschman 
(1981: 7-10).

and Steindl’s demand-led view15. So, the first question regards the availability of savings. An increasing 
inequality could be expected to give rise to larger savings, accelerating growth, since the rich tend to have 
lower propensities to consume than the poor. According to him, this did not happen in Latin America, 
however, especially because the elites tended to imitate the consumption pattern of the elites of the rich 
countries.16 He generally reasoned, then, assuming a constant saving rate, despite rising inequality.17 
 
If the supply of savings was considered constant, what could explain a deceleration of growth? 

With accumulation defined as 𝑔!= !!=!!, in which 𝐼, 𝐾, 𝑠 and 𝑣 denote, respectively, investment, capital 

stock,  saving  rate  and  the  capital-output  ratio,  it  is  clear  that,  given  a  constant  saving  rate,  slower 
accumulation can only come from a higher capital-output ratio (that is, higher capital intensity). Furtado 
explained  it  as  a  consequence  of  a  cumulative  process  that  linked  increasing  inequality  to  increasing 
capital intensity: “a higher amount of capital per unit of employment means a more unequal distribution 
of  income,  if  the  wage  is  maintained  stable.”  (1965:  171)  This  more  unequal  distribution  of  income 
reinforces the process of increasing capital intensity, by shifting demand towards luxury goods and, thus, 
pushing  forward  the  capital  deepening.  The  labor  market  dualism,  thus,  guaranteed  that  capital 
accumulation  would  be  accompanied  by  increasing  inequality  and  a  deepening  of  the  dualism  of  the 
consumption market. The latter, in its turn, would accelerate the shift towards capital-intensive sectors, 
which would further increase inequality and the consumption dualism itself. This cumulative process had, 
concretely, two effects on growth (1965: 171). 
First, it reduced the capacity of the development process to absorb labor from the subsistence 
sector and, in this way, to transform the economic structure and enlarge the consumption market. He 
referred to that effect as a reduction of the employment multiplier of the growth process (1975: 283-289). 
It had, in its turn, the effect of reducing the stimulus for investment in the agricultural and nondurable 
goods  sectors  that  sold  its  production  to  the  low-wage  workers,  which  could  otherwise  attenuate  the 
tendency towards capital deepening. Second, the high capital-output ratios in the growing sectors meant 
increasing inefficiency of production, given that the limited size of the market entailed low levels of 
grew  faster  than  what  could  be  explained  by  technological  requirements  (1965:  170).  A  related 
consequence was a demand leakage and a greater rigidity of the current account, given that the import 
content  of  the  durable  and  capital  goods  sectors  were  higher  than  average  and  that  some  of  the 
consumption  demand  of  the  rich  was  met  directly  by  imports.  Briefly  put,  Furtado’s  stagnationist 
argument  related  the  cumulative  process  between  inequality  and  rising  capital-output  ratio  to  a 
deceleration of structural change, rising inefficiency and a more binding foreign exchange constraint.  
A few years later, in the beginning of the milagre, this view became increasingly untenable and 
started to be questioned. Probably the most famous critique of Furtado’s stagnationism was provided by 
Maria  da  Conceição  Tavares  and  José  Serra  (1971/1976)  in  an  essay  titled  “Além  da  estagnação” 
(Beyond stagnation).18 They deal specially with the specifics of Brazilian capitalist development in the 
period, but two theoretical points they make are important to the present argument.19 First, they question 
Furtado’s  claim  that  inequality  led  to  inadequate  markets  for  durable  goods.  According  to  them,  the 

capacity utilization and the impossibility to reap the benefits of scale economies, with the result that 𝑣 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

15 See Serrano (2001: 139-142) and Bastos and D’Avila (2009). It is noteworthy that Kalecki (1968/1980) himself thought his 
demand-led  understanding  of  growth  was  applicable  only  to  developed  countries  and  that  the  underdeveloped  ones  faced 
supply constraints. See also Dutt (2013). 
16 This was a widely held view among the early development economists. See, for instance, Nurkse (1953: chap. 3), who 
explained it by resorting to Duesenberry’s “demonstration effect,” and Furtado (1952: 21-27), for a comment on Nurkse’s 
argument.  
17 Another reason was that scarce investment opportunities tended to depress the propensity to save (Furtado, 1975: 282-283). 
In his words, the saving rate “is not independent from the possibilities of investment.” 
18 Bresser-Pereira  (1970)  proposed,  contemporaneously,  a  similar  criticism  of  Furtado.  Tavares  and  Serra’s  criticism  is 
especially significant for the purposes of the present argument, because it bridges Furtado’s analysis and Taylor and Bacha’s 
model. But it is important to note that, in the early 1970s, Furtado’s work in particular and Latin American structuralism in 
general  were  criticized  from  numerous  perspectives.  Two  renowned  examples,  from  the  Left,  are  Cardoso  and  Faletto’s 
(1971/1979) dependency theory and Oliveira’s (1972/2003) work. 
19 Analyses of the debate between Furtado and Tavares and Serra can be found in Serrano (2001: 139-149), Scherer (2007: 
chap. 2), and Bastos and D’Avila (2009). See also Lustig (1980).

dimension of the market is determined by the size of the “economic surplus,” not by the number of people 
that are part of it (1971/1976: 158). Consequently, in contrast to his interpretation, they interpret capacity 
utilization in the sector producing durable goods as a cyclical variable, not as a structural consequence of 
minimum scales of production. In this way, demand plays a role in their view, by influencing capacity 
utilization and, through it, the capital-output ratio and investment. Second, they read Furtado’s argument 
about the rising capital-output ratio as implying a decreasing surplus available for reinvestment, but claim 
that, given that the rate of profit can be decomposed as the output-capital ratio times the profit share, a 
fall  of  the  former  can  be  more  than  compensated  by  a  rise  in  the  latter,  resulting  in  the  end  in  an 
increasing surplus that could be reinvested.20,21 
In this way, if for Furtado (1975: 289-291) the way out of stagnation entailed a deep structural 
transformation in the distribution of income, the consumption pattern, and the productive structure, for 
Tavares  and  Serra  (1971/1976:  168-169)  capitalist  growth  could  be  sustained  simply  by  increasing 
inequality a little (incorporating a small segment of the upper middle classes in the consumption market 
of durable goods) and by compensating the falling output-capital ratio with an increasing profit share. The 
milagre  was  plausibly  made  possible  in  this  precise  way.  Recent  estimates  by  Marquetti,  Maldonado 
Filho and Lautert (2010: 492) show that after falling continuously during the 1950s and early 1960s, the 
profit rate bottoms out in 1964, stabilizes until the late 1960s and rises sharply thereafter, reaching its 
peak in the early 1970s. This trajectory, in its turn, is mostly explained by the trajectory of the profit 
share, which falls from the early 1960s until the mid-1960s and then recovers until the mid-1970s.22 
The nature of both Furtado’s stagnationism and Tavares and Serra’s critique of it is of diagnoses 
of  capitalist  development  in  Brazil.  In  the  parallelism  that  is  being  suggested  presently,  they  are  the 
somewhat equivalent to Steindl’s work. The move towards more general models, relatively independent 
of specific contexts, was made by Lance Taylor and Edmar Bacha (1976). Their model represents for the 
Latin American story a transition similar to the one Rowthorn’s (1981), Dutt’s (1984), Taylor’s (1985) 
models represented to the Kaleckian thread, with the caveat that in the latter the 1980s’ literature could 
build on the formalizations that Kalecki and Steindl had themselves proposed, whereas Taylor and Bacha 
attempted to represent with a formal model a literature that was done with almost no mathematics23. 
In the Kaleckian episode, the interaction between demand and distribution that was the basis of 
Steindl’s work is decoupled from his interpretation of the United States’ capitalism and presented in a 
more general form. Similarly, Taylor and Bacha picked up from the Furtado and from Tavares and Serra 
the analysis of the interaction between distribution, consumption patterns, and structural change, leaving 
aside their dispute about the trajectory of the Brazilian economy from the 1960s until the early 1970s. It is 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

20 Their  interpretation  of  Furtado’s  argument  can  be  clarified  in  terms  of  the  famous  Cambridge  equation  (with  causality 
interpreted from savings to investment, respecting his view), which relates accumulation to the propensity to save and to the 
profit rate. It is, in fact, an adaptation of the equation mentioned above, which assumes no savings out of wages, only out of 
profits. Given a constant propensity to save (Furtado’s assumption), a falling profit rate (explained by a falling output-capital 
ratio) would lead to decreasing capital accumulation. Tavares and Serra’s criticism is a bit complicated, because they not only 
question the necessary parallelism between the profit rate and the output-capital ratio by taking into consideration the rate of 
surplus value, but also hint at a demand-led understanding of growth (see, for instance, 1971/1976: 167). See Bastos and 
d’Avila (2009). 

21 The decomposition of the profit rate mentioned can be represented in the following way: 𝑟=!!!!, where 𝑟 is the profit rate,  𝑌 
is output, 𝐾 is the capital stock, and Π is the mass of profits. They express the profit share in terms of the rate of surplus value, 
𝑚: !!= !!!!. So, an increase in the rate of surplus value is equivalent to an increase in the profit share. See Tavares and Serra 

(1971/1976: 163-164, fn. 6) 
22 “The profit share stabilized with the military rule when pro-capital reforms and economic policies were implemented, and it 
rose during the 1968-1973 economic boom. The military dictatorship ended job tenure in the private sector, introduced a new 
wage policy that restricted wage increases, and removed the restriction to profit remittances.” (Marquetti et al., 2010: 493) It 
might be useful to clarify that this interpretation of the milagre can be reconciled both with a supply-led and a demand-led 
understanding of growth. In the latter case, a rising profit rate was not only the result of a higher profit share, but also of the 
increase  in  capacity  utilization  generated  by  an  adaptation  of  the  consumption  pattern  to  the  productive  structure  through 
increasing inequality. Financial reforms that increased autonomous demand (allowing rising credit flows) also contributed to 
increasing utilization. Bastos and D’Avila (2009: 185-187) interpret the milagre along these lines and suggest that this is also 
Tavares and Serra’s (1971/1976) interpretation. 
23 The fact that Taylor plays a role in both episodes may reinforce the case for the parallelism suggested.

noteworthy that Taylor and Bacha’s model is a demand-led one, as the Kaleckians’ models and Tavares 
and Serra’s theory, but in contrast to Furtado supply-led theory. Be that as it may, referring precisely to 
Furtado  and  to  Tavares,  they  explain  their  aim:  “Following  the  lead  of  a  number  of  Latin  American 
institutional analyses, we set up our model in classical form, stressing the role of distributional trends in 
shaping the growth process.” (1976: 199) 
Roughly  put,  their  model  suggests  a  cumulative  process  in  which  accumulation  increases 
inequality, on the one hand, and growing inequality stimulates accumulation, on the other24. It is possible 
to represent it beginning with the macroeconomic equilibrium between investment and savings, as was 
done  with  the  Kaleckian  one,  in  the  previous  section.  Assuming  that  profits  are  entirely  saved,  that 
unskilled workers consume all their income and that skilled workers save a constant fraction of theirs, 
aggregate savings are determined by the level of profits and by total wages paid to skilled workers. They 
claim that this “amounts to a saving-investment balance in Kaleckian form” (1976: 206). 
They further assume a fixed short-run supply of capital and that profits are constant, determined 
by technical coefficients25. Thus, an increase in investment is balanced entirely by an increase in the 
number  of  skilled  laborers.  Given  the  fixed  wage  assumed  (a  constant  multiple  of  the  wage  of  the 
unskilled workers, which is, in its turn, determined by living standards in the subsistence economy, along 
the lines of dual-economy models), a growing number of skilled workers results in a higher amount of 
total wages paid to them and, thus, in higher savings. (At the same time, the higher number of skilled 
workers, given the fixed coefficients of production assumed and a fixed capital stock, result in a higher 
share of wages going to skilled workers. This is what the model means by increasing inequality: higher 
wage inequality.) 
Taylor (1989: 624) would later refer to this model as “neo-Keynesian,” because it assumes that the 
economy operates at full capacity and that the adjustment, as mentioned, is brought about entirely by the 
number of skilled workers26. The effect of investment on the level of skilled workers can be explained by 
two  kinds  of  mechanisms,  one  related  to  market  mechanisms,  the  other,  to  social  institutions.  They 
explain the first thus: 

 

 
 

“Imagine that investment demand increases and is met, if necessary, by governmental diversion 
of resources to capital goods production (…). Then the cost of capital to industries producing 
consumer goods will rise, and the cost of labor will fall. But because unskilled workers have a 
stable real wage, the skilled wage will bear the brunt of the adjustment with a consequent shift in 
the skill mix toward higher wage employees. As a result, more skilled jobs will open up in the 
substitution response to increased capital scarcity.” (1976: 206) 
 
And the second is explained in the following way: 
“Given a repressed, inactive labor movement and strong social desires for upward mobility, it is 
easier to cut back blue-collar than white-collar jobs in the short run, particularly if some blue-
collar employment reductions really take the form of upgrading to middle-class positions. On the 
supply side it is also true that increases in capital and luxury goods production levels will be 
related, since both subsectors are in the ‘advanced’ part of the economy and their entrepreneurs 
make investment decisions in the same expectational milieu. Once again, capital shortages will 
hold  back  expansion  in  more  traditional  wage  goods  industries,  and  poor  workers  facing 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

24 An  interesting  question  for  future  research  concerns  the  methodological  divergence  between  the  two  episodes  here 
discussed. Whereas the Kaleckian thread resorts more commonly to steady state analyses, the Latin American version tends to 
use cumulative processes. The reason behind this divergence might be found by following the hint suggested by Taylor and 
Bacha (1976: 209): “Most growth theory is ill-adapted to analysis of Belindia because it deals with steady states; whereas the 
topic of interest is a secular shift of production and employment patterns within the modern sector.” 
25 “[I]n a competitive economy, there is only one degree of freedom for trade-offs between the real wage and the rate of profit 
along the wage-profit frontier. The surplus labor fixed real wage in the modern sector thus determines both the rate of profit 
and the choice of technique. As long as the wage does not change, one might as well assume fixed techniques.” (Taylor and 
Bacha, 1976: 200, fn. 6) 
26 See Dutt (1990b: 925).

(3), 

escalating relative prices or elongated queues are always welcome to disappear back into the 
subsistence  sector.  (…)  the  substitution  effect  again  works  in  favor  of  skilled  employment 
increases.” (1976: 206-207) 
 
The  other  side  of  the  cumulative  process  is  the  effect  of  the  skilled  worker’s  wage  bill  on 
 
investment (1976: 209-211). They justify this assumption claiming that it is a plausible simplification to 
“assume that investors look only to the leading sector of the economy” (210). Assuming, in addition, that 
the “leading sector” is the production of luxury goods, they define the growth of capital as a function of 
the  growth  of  luxury  goods’  sales  multiplied  by  a  term  that  represents  entrepreneurial  expectations.27 
Moreover, given that, by assumption, unskilled workers consume only wage goods and skilled workers 
consume only luxury goods, the interaction between inequality and investment can be easily identified. 
Thus, the equivalence between aggregate investment and aggregate savings could be represented formally 
in the following way: 

 𝐼(𝛼)=𝑆(𝛼)  
where 𝛼 is the share of skilled workers wages in the total wage bill, an indicator of inequality in the 

 
context of the model. Rising investment, as noted, increases the share of skilled workers on the total wage 
bill, pushing the demand for luxury goods up, stimulating thus a further growth of investment, which, in 
its turn, raises inequality even more. It is interesting to note that, like Tavares and Serra and in contrast to 
Furtado, Taylor and Bacha (1976) formulate a demand-led growth model that results in a positive relation 
between  inequality  and  aggregate  demand,  a  relation  explained  by  their  assumption  about  the 
determinants of investment. 
 
Following Taylor and Bacha (1976), de Janvry and Sadoulet (1983) formulated a more general 
model that can result both in the mentioned cumulative process between growth and inequality or in its 
opposite, a cumulative process between growth and increasing equality28. They refer to the two cases, 
respectively, as social disarticulation and social articulation. By taking this step of generalizing Taylor 
and  Bacha’s  (1976)  result,  they’ve  done  for  the  Latin  American  literature  something  similar  to  what 
Bhaduri, Marglin and Blecker did for the Kaleckian one. An important difference is that, in the Kaleckian 
case, the profit-led result was derived by making small changes in the baseline model, while de Janvry 
and Sadoulet (1983) present a model that, despite its reference to Taylor and Bacha’s (1976), is a big 
departure from it. They go back, for instance, to the savings-constrained theory of Furtado, abandoning 
the demand-led closure shared by Tavares and Serra (1971/1976) and Taylor and Bacha (1976). 
Focusing on the interactions between inequality, consumption pattern, and productive structure, 
they identify the conditions that lead to either social articulation or disarticulation. According to them, 
these conditions are essentially related to the key growth sectors (in terms of the share of total capital 
accumulation that each of them concentrate) and the level of inequality. High levels of inequality and 
capital accumulation concentrated in the sectors producing goods demanded by the richest segments of 
the population lead, like in Taylor and Bacha, to social disarticulation. 
They distinguish between social articulation and disarticulation by the role performed by wages. 
 
In their view, social articulation is a process in which “wages create the bulk of final demand for all 
sectors of the economy. (…) Growth and income distribution are, thus, indissolubly tied together in an 
ultimately progressive manner even if the nature of this relation is marked by serious class confrontations 
and recurrent economic cycles and crises.” (1983: 279) Interestingly, they attribute the explanation of 
such a process to Marx and to Kalecki (1983: 279). It is indeed a description of what the Kaleckian 
literature would call a wage-led demand regime, taking into consideration sectoral diversity. In social 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

27 “Since modern corporations are specialized in mass production of just the goods that consumers in the rapidly growing upper 
strata of the income distribution prefer, there is every reason to think that the growth process is centered on the interaction 
between escalating demand for newly appearing ‘luxuries’ by the ‘rich’ (…) and investment responding to increasing sales on 
the part of corporations producing these goods.” (Taylor and Bacha, 1976: 198) 
28 De  Janvry  and  Sadoulet’s  (1983)  model  is  interesting  for  the  present  narrative  because  it  completes  the  parallelism 
suggested, in spite of its questionable assumptions. On these, see Rattso (1986) and Dutt (1990b: 925-926).

disarticulation, however, wages are only “a cost to capital”, given that “[n]on-workers incomes create 
both the source of savings and the expanding final demand for the key growth sectors.” (1983: 279) 
Finally, their paper provides not only the mentioned generalization of Taylor and Bacha’s (1976) result, 
albeit resorting to a different closure, but also a description of Brazilian development from 1968 to 1977, 
arguing that it represented an instance of social disarticulation, an interpretation of the period not unlike 
Tavares and Serra’s (1971/1976). 
 
3. Varieties of growth and distribution models 
 
The  parallelism  between  the  two  literatures  and  the  numerous  affinities  between  them  may 
suggest  the  fruitfulness  of  greater  interaction.  A  more  analytical  classification  of  them,  as  the  one 
indicated in Table 1, below, can serve as a starting point for examining it more concretely. The top part of 
the table, due to Taylor (2010: 188), is simply a systematization of the Kaleckian framework briefly 
described  in  section  1,  above29.    By  putting  together  the  potential  combinations  of  demand  and 
growth and distribution models. The stability analysis allows one to investigate the possibility of cycles 
and the different models might also serve to compare, in each of them, the impact of different economic 
policies, going beyond the more restrictive comparison between different demand regimes30. Moreover, 
by introducing a variety of models, the systematization broadens the scope of the framework, allowing it 
to be flexible to different historical, institutional and political contexts. It is plausible that, given different 
labor  legislations  and  industrial  structures,  some  economies  might  present,  for  instance,  a  procyclical 
wage share, while others present an anticyclical one. Those two cases are represented, respectively, by the 
profit-squeeze distributive schedule and the wage-squeeze one. 
[Table 1 around here] 

distributive  schedules,  with  positive  or  negative  slopes  in  the (𝜓,𝑢) plane,  it  presents  four  possible 

It might be useful to mention, to make the varieties more concrete, that Barbosa-Filho and Taylor’s 
(2006) structuralist Goodwin model is a profit-led, profit-squeeze one, that is, variety (4) of the table, 
although  they  also  discuss  variety  (2)31.  Dutt’s  (1984)  original  model,  in  its  turn,  could  be  roughly 
classified as a wage-led, profit-squeeze one, model (3), with the caveats that, in this case, the demand 
schedule and the distributive one operate in different time horizons, as mentioned, and that he actually 
resorts  to  a  nonlinear  distributive  schedule.  This  issue  of  nonlinearity  is,  by  the  way,  an  important 
limitation  of  the  systematization  above,  since  there  is  mounting  evidence  of  nonlinear  schedules 
(Nikiforos and Foley, 2012). 
Moving  down  to  the  bottom  part  of  Table  1,  one  finds  four  other  varieties  of  growth  and 
distribution models, inspired by the Latin American literature. Concerning the demand schedule, these 
models emphasize wage inequality instead of the functional distribution of income. In fact, Furtado’s and 
Tavares and Serra’s (1971/1976) work incorporate both dimensions of the distribution of income, but 
Taylor  and  Bacha’s  (1976)  and  de  Janvry  and  Sadoulet’s  (1983)  models  restrict  the  analysis  to  the 
inequality between skilled and unskilled workers and workers and managers, respectively. Given the very 
substantial wage inequality observed in most capitalist economies, focusing exclusively on the functional 
distribution of income leaves out a potentially important phenomenon. Recently, this limit began to be 
addressed by Kaleckians with the formulation of models that incorporate either wage inequality or the

30 The stability analysis reported in the table is a simplification. For more precise discussions of the issue, which is beyond the 
scope of the present paper, see Bhaduri (2008) and Lavoie (2014: 381-386). 
31 Goodwin’s  (1967)  own  model  is  a  bit  different,  since  it  relates  the  wage  share  and  employment  (instead  of  capacity 
utilization), but it could be roughly classified as a savings-driven, profit squeeze one, model (4).

personal distribution of income (Palley, 2014, 2015; Carvalho and Rezai, 2016)32. The Latin American 
literature could contribute to this ongoing research. 
The  distributive  schedule  that  can  be  extracted  from  the  Latin  American  episode  is  a  larger 
departure from the Kaleckian one, because  it incorporates sectoral heterogeneity.  With a few notable 
exceptions, like Taylor’s (1983: 170-176, 1989) model, the Kaleckian literature is based mostly on single-
good models, disregarding issues that can only be dealt in multi-sector frameworks33. As Dutt (1990b: 
915) argues, two-sector models are called for when there is a significant difference between the products 
of the two sectors. In the Latin American literature, two differences are emphasized. First, the level of 
skill required from the workers of each sector. In Taylor and Bacha’s (1976) model, for instance, the 
sector that produces wage-goods employs only unskilled workers and the sector that produces luxury-
goods employs only skilled workers. Second, the group that consumes the product of each sector is also 
different.  To  use,  again,  Taylor  and  Bacha’s  (1976)  example,  they  assume  that  luxury-goods  are 
consumed only by skilled workers and that wage-goods are consumed only by unskilled workers. 
As can be easily noted, these two sectoral differences can easily generate cumulative processes. If 
wage inequality increases, the demand composition shifts towards luxury-goods. This shift, in its turn, 
tends to increase the share of luxury-goods in total output and, through the labor market, to increase wage 
inequality further. This would be the unequalizing spiral, described by Bacha and Taylor (1976), which 
corresponds in the table to model (6). De Janvry and Sadoulet’s (1983) social articulation case could be 
roughly classified as model (7), an equality-led, unskilled-labor-biased-growth one. 
That actual capitalist economies are characterized by sectoral heterogeneity in terms of the level 
of skill required for production should not be controversial. Nor that this may be a crucial mediation 
between  growth  and  wage  inequality,  much  of  the  change  of  the  latter  stemming  from  composition 
effects.  There  is  more  doubt,  however,  about  the  other  source  of  heterogeneity,  that  is,  demand 
composition.  The  evidence  available  (Wells,  1974,  1977;  Lustig,  1982;  Medeiros,  2015:  chap.  2; 
Carvalho et al., 2016) is ambiguous, some of it suggesting heterogeneity, some of it suggesting that the 
composition  of  demand  of  different  income  groups  is  not  different  enough  to  have  macroeconomic 
implications. 
Taylor’s (1983: 170-176, 1989) model examined above is, interestingly, in-between the Kaleckian 
and  the  Latin  American  literatures.  It  is  a  two-sector  model  and  it  also  has  different  income  groups 
consuming the products of different sectors. But it does not take into consideration heterogeneous levels 
of  skills  between  workers,  so  that  the  difference  between  the  two  sectors,  concerning  the  production 
dimension, is their labor productivity and, given a common wage, their profit share. With this formal 
structure, a shift in the composition of demand towards luxury- and investment-goods does not increase 
wage inequality (which is assumed away) but it raises the profit share, if this sector is less labor-intensive. 
In this case, then, a distributive schedule incorporating sectoral heterogeneity is combined with a demand 
schedule that depends on the functional distribution of income. This example clarifies that the varieties of 
growth and distribution models are not restricted to the eight presented above, but can be extended to 
combinations of demand and distributive schedules that combine the two parts of the table. 
Some particular historical periods seem to suggest the fruitfulness of the varieties of growth and 
distribution models that incorporate sectoral heterogeneity. The interpretation of the Brazilian milagre 
econômico along the lines suggested by model (6), Taylor and Bacha’s, has already been pointed out. The 
more recent growth acceleration in Brazil, from 2004 to 2010, might also need a model of this sort in 
order to be properly understood, although now the dynamics seem to resemble model (7), the equality-
led,  unskilled-labor-biased-growth  one.  Further  research  is  needed  to  assess  this  suggestion,  but  both 
falling wage inequality (and a growing wage share) and a shift of the productive structure towards sectors 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

32 A hypothesis that could be easily incorporated in Kaleckian models is that the salaries of managers are related, in some way, 
to the profit share. This argument, put forward by Bacha (1974/1978) in the Latin American discussion, allows one to connect 
the functional distribution of income and wage inequality. 
33 For other Kaleckian two-sector models, see Dutt (1990a: chaps. 6-7), and for a survey of models that incorporate sectoral 
heterogeneity, see Dutt (1990b). For a critique of Kaleckian arguments from the standpoint of a multisectoral framework, see 
Steedman (1992).

intensive in unskilled-labor were observed in the period and it is plausible that one development might 
have fed the other34. 
 
Models  are,  of  course,  abstractions.  Their  usefulness  should  be  judged  by  their  ability  to 
illuminate  particular  historical  developments  and  different  models  might  be  more  adequate,  thus,  to 
interpret  different  historical  periods  or  different  economies.  The  interaction  suggested  between  the 
Kaleckian and the Latin American literatures should be understood as an attempt to expand the available 
varieties of models so that the researcher has more options to choose from35. The choice should be made 
based on what seems to be the more salient aspects of the development to be interpreted and it is plausible 
that, in some cases, the role of sectoral heterogeneity as a mediation between growth and distribution will 
be among them. 
 

 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

34 This suggestion is elaborated more carefully in Rugitsky (2016), where the recent period is called the antimilagre. For a 
more detailed examination of recent Brazilian developments in light of Kaleckian models, see Carvalho and Rugitsky (2015). 
35 The potential for interaction between these two literatures is not restricted, of course, to the suggestions made in the present 
paper. An interesting example concerns the incorporation of Duesenberry’s “demonstration effect” in Kaleckian models. See, 
for  instance,  Ryoo  and  Kim  (2014)  and  Setterfield  and  Kim  (2016).  As  mentioned,  this  was  also  a  decisive  element  of 
Furtado’s thinking and interaction in this area might also be fruitful.
