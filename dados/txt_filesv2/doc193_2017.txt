Commodity boom and environmental policy: what lies 

behind the Amazon deforestation 

Rodrigo M Pereira - IPEA 

Abstract 

This  paper  investigates  the  apparent  paradox  of  the  mid  2000’s  sharp  reduction  in  the 
deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon that happened alongside fast growing commodity markets. 
Particular attention is given to the role played by PPCDAM, an environmental policy introduced 
by the federal government in 2004. We use a panel of 760 Amazon municipalities and 15 years 
to estimate the effects of well-known drivers in the deforestation process, such as cattle herd and 
soybean crops, as well as the effect of the conservation policy. The results suggest that the policy 
not  only  had  a  direct  effect  of  reducing  deforestation,  but  also  rendered  deforestation  less 
sensitive to fluctuations in the Amazon commodity production. We also perform a counterfactual 
exercise, estimating the levels of deforestation that would have been registered, had the policy 
not existed. We estimate that the plan saved a total of 196 thousand square kilometers of forest 
between  2005  and  2015,  corresponding  to  almost  twice  the  total  amount  of  deforestation 
observed during this period, and 4.9% of the entire Brazilian Amazon forest. 

Resumo 

Este  artigo  investiga  o  aparente  paradoxo  da  forte  redução  no  desmatamento  da 
Amazônia  brasileira  de  meados  dos  anos  2000,  que  ocorreu  paralelamente  a  um  rápido 
crescimento  dos  mercados  de  commodities.  Uma  atenção  especial  é  dada  ao  papel 
desempenhado  pelo  PPCDAM,  uma  política  ambiental  introduzida  pelo  governo  federal  em 
2004. Utilizamos um painel de 760 municípios da Amazônia e 15 anos para estimar os efeitos de 
conhecidos condutores do processo de desmatamento tais como o rebanho bovino e as lavouras 
de soja, bem como os efeitos da política de conservação. Os resultados sugerem que a política 
não  apenas  teve  um  efeito  direto  de  redução  do  desmatamento,  mas  também  tornou  o 
desmatamento  menos  sensível  a  flutuações  na  produção  de  commodities  na  Amazônia. 
Realizamos também um exercício contra factual em que estimamos os níveis de desmatamento 
que  ocorreriam  caso  a  política  ambiental  não  tivesse  sido  implementada.  Estimamos  que  a 
política salvou um total de 196 mil quilômetros quadrados de floresta entre 2005 e 2015, o que 
corresponde a quase duas vezes o total de desmatamento observado no período, e a 4,9% de toda 
a floresta amazônica brasileira.

1 - Introduction 

In the first decade of the century there was a large worldwide expansion in the demand 
for all kinds of commodities. With prices going up, commodity exporters strongly benefited from 
those  market  conditions,  unleashing  an  intense  run  for  minerals,  oil,  pasture,  cattle,  and 
agricultural land. In spite of the positive consequences for economies largely relying on primary 
goods,  such  as  Brazil,  this  event  raised  environmental  concerns  due  to  the  increase  in  the 
pressure  on  tropical  forests  like  the  Amazon.  This  relationship  between  commodity  expansion 
and deforestation is in the forefront of empirical research on the Brazilian Amazon. Specifically, 
cattle  ranching  and  soybean  crops  have  been  pointed  out  by  a  number  of  studies  as  the  key 
driving forces behind the Amazon deforestation (Barona et al., 2010; Fearnside, 2005; Margulis, 
2004; Ferraz, 2001; Andersen, 1996; Walker et al., 2000).  

The deforestation issue is, however, a lot more complex, and the literature has expanded 
in several directions. Araújo et al. (2014) show that off-farm incomes increase the opportunity 
cost of farming, reducing deforestation. Hargrave and Kis-Katos (2013) show that soybean prices 
as well as increases in the availability of official agricultural credit are associated with increases 
of deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon. Andersen and Granger (2007), Kirby et al.(2006), 
and Barber et al. (2014) highlight the effect of roads on the Amazon deforestation. Chomitz and 
Thomas (2003) relate deforestation to precipitation. They show that higher rainfall decreases the 
probability of the forest being converted for agriculture or pasture. Pfaff (1999) shows that the 
presence  of  roads  and  development  projects,  the  soil  quality,  and  the  distance  from  consumer 
markets  affect  deforestation.  Faria,  W.  and  Almeida,  A.  (2016)  find  that  openness  to  trade 
enhances deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Some authors also point out that land ownership 
conflicts are an important cause of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon (Alston et al.,2000 and 
Araujo  et  al.  2009).  Land  reforms  promoted  by  the  federal  agency  INCRA  would  typically 
render forested areas vulnerable to invasion by squatters. Since productive land is off the limits 
of these reforms, a perverse incentive for land owners to deforest is then created. 

More recent data on deforestation suggests the presence of new elements that may have 
changed the way deforestation relates to fluctuations in commodity markets. Most notably, after 
2004 there was a sharp and persistent decline of deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, in 
spite of hefty increases on prices of all commodities. Precisely when deforestation was expected 
to increased, during the peak of the worldwide commodity boom, there was a remarkable change 
of trajectory. Not coincidently, it that same  year of 2004 the Brazilian  government launched  a 
federal plan for the conservation of the Brazilian Amazon, the PPCDAM (Plano de Prevencao e 
Controle  do  Desmatamento  da  Amazonia  Legal).  Since  its  introduction,  the  plan  has  been  the 
major  federal  environmental  policy  for  the  Amazon.  It  was  based  on  subsidies  to  sustainable 
farming,  land  use  planning,  the  creation  of  conservation  units,  and  most  importantly,  the 
enforcement  of  environmental  laws  through  new  technologies  that  allowed  the  instantaneous 
detection  of  new  deforested  areas.  Assuncao  et  al.  (2012)  investigate  the  role  played  by  the 
PPCDAM and other conservation policies that were implemented in the Brazilian Amazon after 
2004. They show that these policies were highly effective in reducing deforestation. 

One  of  the  most  important  questions  today  in  order  to  understand  the  deforestation 
process in the Brazilian Amazon is what drove deforestation down after 2004. What explains a 
fivefold  reduction  of  deforestation  in  the  Brazilian  Amazon,  notwithstanding  a  simultaneous 
expansion of worldwide commodity markets? In addition, when commodity markets sunk, and 

2 

 

prices collapsed after 2012, deforestation slightly increased in the Brazilian Amazon. Was there 
a reversal in a relationship that has been well stablished by evidence and common sense? Was 
the  new  policy  so  effective  that  it  overwhelmed  the  effect  of  the  commodity  boom?  Or  did  it 
change the way the forest structurally relates to fluctuations in the commodity markets?  

In this paper we investigate the determinants of  deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, 
with particular emphasis given to the role played by this specific environmental policy of 2004, 
the PPCDAM. We use a panel of 760 Amazon municipalities and 15 years. The results suggest 
that municipal population growth, cattle grazing, total areas of permanent and temporary crops, 
as  well  as  soybean  crops  significantly  affect  deforestation.  Moreover,  the  new  environmental 
policy  significantly  reduced  deforestation  in  the  Brazilian  Amazon.  The  policy  also  rendered 
deforestation  less  sensitive  to  fluctuations  in  crop  areas  and  cattle  herds  in  the  Amazon.  The 
estimation  of  a  deforestation  equation  allows  us  to  perform  an  interesting  exercise  of  policy 
evaluation. We address the question of how effective has PPCDAM been to reduce deforestation 
in  the  Brazilian  Amazon.  The  model  predicts  that  a  much  higher  level  of  deforestation  would 
have  taken  place  from  2005  to  2015  had  the  PPCDAM  not  been  implemented.  Our  results 
indicate  that  the  policy  avoided  196  thousand  square  kilometers  of  accumulated  deforestation 
through these 11 years, which is almost twice the amount of actual deforestation that occurred in 
the period, and approximately 4.9% of the remaining forested areas in the Brazilian Amazon. 

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2  presents  a  descriptive  overview  of  the 
Brazilian  Amazon  deforestation,  underlining  how  it  relates  to  commodity  markets.  Section  3 
introduces  a  theoretical  model  of  deforestation  in  which  increases  in  the  environmental  policy 
stringency such as the launching of PPCDAM affect the farmer´s decision in terms of land use, 
consequently  leading  to  deforestation.  In  section  4  we  use  a  panel  data  of  760  Amazon 
municipalities  observed  through  15  years  to  estimate  a  deforestation  equation,  with  special 
attention  on  the  effect  of  the  environmental  policy.  Section  5  presents  some  counterfactual 
exercises  that  can  be  used  for  policy  evaluation  purposes.  Section  6  concludes  the  paper 
highlighting the key findings and their policy implications. 

2 - An Overview of the Amazon Deforestation 

Deforestation in  the Brazilian Amazon has been monitored  with satellite data since the 
late 1980's by INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais), a National Institute for Space 
Research,  funded  by  the  Federal  Government.  The  institute  monitors  cleared  forested  areas  in 
what is defined as the Legal Amazon (Amazonia Legal). The area comprises the whole northern 
region  (states  of  Amazonas,  Para,  Acre,  Rondonia,  Roraima,  Tocantins  and  Amapa)  plus  the 
center-western state of Mato Grosso, and around two thirds of the territory of the northeastern 
state of Maranhao. There are a total of 760 municipalities in the Legal Amazon. INPE provides 
aggregate deforestation  data, in deforested square  kilometers, since 1988.  In 2000 the institute 
also began providing municipal data on deforestation. Unlike the aggregate data, the local data is 
presented  by  INPE  as  the  total  cumulative  cleared  areas  in  square  kilometers  for  all  the  760 
municipalities.  Deforestation  that  took  place  in  a  particular  year  would  then  be  the  difference 
between  the  total  cleared  areas  in  that  year  and  the  year  before.  Deforested  areas  are  forever 

 

3 

considered as such in INPE's methodology, no matter if the forest is eventually regenerated in 
those areas.1 

 The municipal data was a very important step because of the impossibility of gathering a 
large  amount  of  aggregate  time  series  data,  through  higher  observation  frequencies.  In  fact, 
deforestation data are always annual observations. The presence of large clouds during the whole 
Amazon rainy season prevents any attempt to get monthly or quarterly data on deforestation. 

Aggregate deforestation is relatively volatile from the late 1980's up to 2004. From then 
on  a  steady  decline  begins,  with  current  annual  aggregate  deforestation  corresponding  to 
approximately 20% of its peak value. The big boom in commodity prices occurred between 2004 
and 2012. Beef prices in 2014, for example, doubled if compared to the 2005 value. Soybeans 
were 2.5 times more expensive in 2012 as compared to 2004. Figure 1 depicts those trajectories, 
where the index of annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is plotted against some IMF's 
commodity price indexes, namely maize, soybean, beef, and a bundle for all commodities (fuel 
and non-fuel).2 

Figure 2 presents the same aggregate deforestation series, along with cattle herd and the 
total  of  crop  areas  in  the  Legal  Amazon  allocated  to  permanent  crops,  temporary  crops 
(including  soybean),  and  soybean  crops.  Areas  for  soybeans  and  other  temporary  crops  had 
substantial increases from 2005 to 2015 (around 50%), the cattle herd had a moderate increase 
(around 12%), and there was a reduction of roughly 12% in the areas aimed for permanent crops. 
Those  trajectories  by  themselves  cannot  explain  the  almost  fivefold  reduction  in  deforestation 
observed  through  the  period.  If  nothing  else,  they  would  be  consistent  with  increases  in 
deforestation.

1  It is a conventional wisdom for forest engineers that it  would take more than 100  years for a full restoration of 
biodiversity in regenerated rain forests such as the Amazon. Even though, they might have their canopy layers very 
close to an untouched forest in a matter of a few years, with both types of forest looking identical from a satellite 
perspective.

Figure  1  suggests  that  after  2004  the  relationship  between  commodity  prices  and 
deforestation  has  changed.  It  seems  that  the  early  positive  correlations  gave  way  to  negative 
correlations. This fact can be confirmed by splitting the sample in two segments: one that goes 
until  2004,  and  another  that  begins  in  2005.  We  can  then  calculate  Pearson  correlation 
coefficients  between  the  Amazon  deforestation  and  the  prices  of  several  commodities,  for  the 
two consecutive time spans. The results are presented in Table 1. Again, we use IMF commodity 
price indexes, based on nominal US dollars. The changes in the correlation coefficients are quite 
remarkable. Most of them were positive until 2004, and became negative thereafter, suggesting a 
substantial change in the way fluctuations in commodity markets would affect the deforestation 
of the Amazon forest. 

But how can increases in soybean crops and cattle ranching in the Legal Amazon coexist 
with sharp reductions in deforestation? One possibility is to think of two alternative technologies 
available for the farmer, one that requires deforestation and another that does not. In the absence 
of  monitoring  and  punishment  for  bad  behavior,  the  first,  forest  unfriendly  technology  is 
preferred. When authorities start monitoring deforestation as well as enforcing the law, there is a 
migration of farmers from the bad to the good technology. So even with a booming market, with 
prices  and  profits  increasing,  raises  in  production  are  compatible  with  reductions  in 
deforestation, as long as there are farmers changing their technologies. 

Another possibility is to consider a technology in which land is an input with substitutes. 
So,  if  the  markets  for  the  commodities  produced  by  the  farm  are  booming,  the  farmer  would 
naturally increase production, hiring more inputs. That includes more land, which may increase 
deforestation.  However,  if  there  is  a  simultaneous  increase  of  environmental  sanctions,  the 
expected  cost  of  land  would  increase  for  the  farmer.  That  could  be  either  because  he  faces 
harsher  penalties  if  caught  illegally  deforesting,  or  because  the  probability  of  being  caught 
becomes higher. In any case, the substitution of land for other inputs may be profit maximizing. 
Therefore, the  combination of booming commodity markets  and a lower  level of deforestation 
may not be as unfamiliar as it seems. Those questions are addressed in more detail in section 3.

The local level of deforestation for every municipality within the Legal Amazon can be 
seen with the help of quantile maps. Because there is a  wide variation on the size of Amazon 
municipalities, using raw deforestation as the variable to be represented on the map would not be 
a very  accurate procedure. In fact,  gigantic municipalities would tend to have more deforested 
areas  than  the  tiny  ones.  So,  we  will  rather  divide  deforestation  by  the  municipal  area,  which 
gives us an idea of the intensity of deforestation in a  particular location.  Figure 3 presents the 
quantile  map  of  deforestation  as  a  share  of  municipal  area  for  2015.  The  map  shows  the 
municipalities  that  were  being  more  intensely  deforested  in  2015.  The  darker  areas,  where 
deforestation took place in 2015, are right in the center of the Legal Amazon. The lighter areas in 

 

6 

the north and northwest are relatively preserved, and the light areas in the south and southeast are 
transitional areas, where Cerrados (Central Savanas) are the prominent type of environment. So, 
without the thick Amazon forest, deforestation is not registered in those areas, by definition. 

 

                              Figure 3: 2015 Deforestation as a Share of Municipal Area  

 

 

 

Another picture worth analyzing is the cumulative deforestation. Some of the dark areas 
of the previous map indicate intense deforestation, but it may be a recent activity, in which case 
the area would still be relatively preserved. On the other hand, there may be light areas with low 
instantaneous activity because, say, it was already deforested in the past, and there is not many 
forested areas left over. Figure 4 presents the quantile map of cumulative deforestation as a share 
of  municipal  area,  up  to  2015.  The  map  represents  the  overall  damage  that  was  made  to  the 
Amazon up to date. The Arc of Deforestation is easily noticeable, with the darker areas forming 
an arc that comprises the northeast of the Legal Amazon (States of Maranhao, eastern Para and 
the northern tip of Tocantins), the north and southwest of Mato Grosso, the whole Rondonia, and 
the eastern part of Acre. In some municipalities in Maranhao, eastern Para and Roraima almost 
100% of the forest is already gone.

Besides INPE's deforestation data described on the previous section, we use here several 
other economic data of the Legal Amazon municipalities. Brazil's IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de 
Geografia  e  Estatistica)  provides  annual  data  on  municipal  GDP  in  thousand  reais  of  2014, 
municipal  cattle  herd  in  heads,  municipal  permanent  and  temporary  crops  in  hectares,  and 
municipal  soybean  crops  in  hectares.  Soybean  is  a  temporary  crop,  and  is  included  in  the 
aggregation  of  all  temporary  crops.  The  data  consists  of  areas  that  were  planted  (but  not 
necessarily  harvested).  So  we  have  a  panel  of  15  years,  from  2001  to  2015,  and  760 
municipalities.3 Population data  might also be useful to explain deforestation. It is available in 
two  points  of  time,  the  2000  and  the  2010  censuses.  Based  on  these  observations  we  can 
construct  cross  section  variables  to  be  used  in  a  panel  data  estimation.  So  we  take  population 
growth observed in every municipality within these ten years, and the share of rural population in 
the  total  population  for  every  municipality.  The  idea  is  to  investigate  if  municipalities  with  a 
higher share of rural settlements tend to be more forest unfriendly than the more urbanized ones. 
                                                            
3 INPE’s municipal data starts in 2000, but the first observation in the time series is lost because deforestation is 
defined as the first difference of the total cleared areas.

3 - Theoretical Framework 

In this section we introduce a simple model of deforestation. We assume a representative 
farm  that  produces  a  single  output  Y,  using  two  inputs:  labor  N,  and  land  L.  The  government 
imposes a limit of land use of (cid:1)(cid:2). Deforestation is allowed only within the limits of (cid:1)(cid:2). Labor and 
land have unitary costs of w and x, respectively, and the product is sold at the price of q per unit. 
We assume that markets are competitive. If the farmer abides by the law, his total cost is wN + 
xL. The farmer can, however, choose to use more land than (cid:1)(cid:2) , in which case he enters a lottery. 
If the extra forest clearing is not detected by the authorities, then every unit of extra land simply 
costs x. But, if the illegal deforestation is detected, sanctions are imposed on the farmer. They 
can  be  environmental  fines,  seizure  of  property,  machines,  or  even  jail  time.  To  make  things 
simple, we just assume an extra cost of z per unit of deforested land above the legal limit (cid:1)(cid:2).4 So, 
if detected, the farmer pays x for the first (cid:1)(cid:2) units of land, and x + z on every unit thereafter. If p 
is the probability of detection when the farmer decides to extend his farming area beyond (cid:1)(cid:2), his 
expected profit is given by: 

 

(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5), (cid:7), (cid:8), (cid:9), (cid:10)(cid:11) = (cid:5)(cid:13) − (cid:7)(cid:15) − (cid:8)(cid:1) − (cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:8)(cid:18)0, (cid:10)(cid:20)(cid:4)(cid:1) − (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:11)(cid:21)                      (1) 

                                                                                      s. t. (cid:22)(cid:4)(cid:15), (cid:1)(cid:11) ≥ (cid:13)  

 

where  (cid:22)(cid:4)(cid:15), (cid:1)(cid:11)  is  a  standard  technology  with  positive  and  decreasing  marginal 
productivities.  The  farmer’s  objective  is  to  maximize  his  expected  profit.  The  first  order 
optimality conditions are given by: 

 

(cid:5)(cid:22)(cid:24)(cid:4)(cid:15), (cid:1)(cid:11) = (cid:7)                      (2) 

(cid:5)(cid:22)(cid:25)(cid:4)(cid:15), (cid:1)(cid:11) = (cid:8)        if  (cid:1) ≤ (cid:1)(cid:2)                         (3) 

(cid:5)(cid:22)(cid:25)(cid:4)(cid:15), (cid:1)(cid:11) = (cid:8) + (cid:10)(cid:20)        if  (cid:1) > (cid:1)(cid:2)                     (4) 

 

So,  the  value  of  labor’s  marginal  productivity  is  equal  to  the  wage,  and  the  value  of 
land’s marginal productivity is equal to the expected marginal cost of land. If the farmer decides 
to  use  more  than  (cid:1)(cid:2)  of  land,  that  cost  includes  the  regular  price  of  land,  x,  plus  what  could  be 
defined as policy stringency, which is based in two measures: the probability p of being caught 
deforesting more than the legal threshold (cid:1)(cid:2), and the associated penalty cost per unit of land, z.  

When  the  market  for  the  commodity  produced  by  this  farmer  is  booming,  there  are 
increases in the price q. The profit maximizing response is to increase labor and land, reducing 
their  marginal  productivity  in  such  a  way  that  the  left-hand  side  of  equations  (2),  (3)  and  (4) 
remain constant.  
                                                            
4 The idea is that any type of cost, no matter how prohibitive, has its equivalent in monetary terms.

A  policy  designed  to  reduce  deforestation  amidst  a  commodity  boom  would  naturally 
target  the  policy  stringency  pz  in  such  a  way  that  increases  in  the  commodity  price  q  (and 
consequently in the labor force N) would be matched by an increase in the expected cost of land 
x + pz, keeping land use L constant, or even reducing it. That’s exactly what PPCDAM did in 
2004. The plan comprised a series of actions designed to reduce deforestation. The war against 
deforestation would no longer be waged only by environmental agencies, but rather it would be 
in the forefront of Brazil's top policy priorities. Among other things, PPCDAM created subsidies 
to  sustainable  activities  within  the  forest,  and  land  use  planning,  with  the  creation  of  several 
conservation  units.  Most  importantly,  the  plan  relied  on  new  technologies  to  launch  a  system 
called  DETER,  allowing  almost  real  time  detection  of  new  deforested  areas,  streamlining  the 
enforcement  of  the  existing  environmental  laws.  That  changed  the  pattern  of  deforestation. 
Ranchers  begun  cutting  small  pockets  of  forest,  enough  to  be  below  DETER's  detection 
threshold (although detected by the regular annual monitoring). Overall, deforestation rates fell 
sharply. In fact, the data suggests that the plan was so effective in raising policy stringency that 
even  with  the  steep  rise  in  commodity  prices  there  was  a  remarkable,  never  before  seen, 
reduction in the deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon.  

4 – Estimation 

We  want  to  evaluate  the  quantitative  effects  of  variables  that  are  commonly  listed  as 
determinants of the Amazon deforestation, such as cattle herd, crop areas, population, municipal 
GDP,  etc.  We  also  want  to  investigate  if  the  policies  adopted  in  2004  in  the  form  of  the 
PPCDAM can explain the massive reduction of deforestation observed afterwards. The empirical 
strategy  is  to  use  a  panel  of  760  municipalities  and  15  years,  totaling  11400  observations,  to 
estimate the following deforestation equation.  

 

(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:31) ! = "# + "$%(cid:29)& !’$ + "()(cid:17)**+(cid:30) ! + ",&)-.(cid:10) ! + "/0)-.(cid:10) ! + "12.(cid:9) ! + "34-(cid:30)(cid:17)  + "5&.(cid:10)%  +
"678&.(cid:10)  + 9$(cid:29)! + 9((cid:29)!)(cid:17)**+(cid:30) ! + 9,(cid:29)!&)-.(cid:10) ! + 9/(cid:29)!0)-.(cid:10) ! + 91(cid:29)!2.(cid:9) ! + :  + ; !                    (5) 

 

Differently  from  the  maps  presented  in  section  2,  the  variable  Defit  here  is  raw 
deforestation, rather than deforestation as a share of municipal area. The reason is that we can 
control for the municipal area, by adding that variable in the regression equation. It would be a 
cross-sectional variable, time invariant, hence the absence of the sub-index t in Areai. Based on 
the 2000 and 2010 censuses, two other cross-sectional variables are created, namely, municipal 
population growth, and rural population as a share of total population on every municipality. The 
population growth calculates the percentual growth in the population of every municipality in the 
legal Amazon between the years 2010 and 2000. The rural population ratio is calculated with the 
data  of  the  latest  census  of  2010.  The  term  αi  captures  unobserved  variables  that  are  time 
invariant,  not  included  in  the  model.  When  we  perform  fixed  effects  estimation  all  these  time 
invariant  variables  disappear  from  the  model.  We  also  perform  a  random  effects  estimation, 
along  with  a  standard  pooled  OLS.  In  these  cases  the  observed  time  invariant  variables  are 
present, while the unobserved ones in  αi mingle with the error term, and there is a well-known 
possibility of inconsistencies.

There  are  five  explanatory  variables  with  a  panel  structure,  namely,  municipal  GDP 
(GDPit), cattle herd (Cattleit), total areas of permanent crops (PCropit), total areas of temporary 
crops (TCropit), and total areas of soybean crops (Soyit).5 These agricultural areas are measured 
in hectares, while deforestation is measured in square kilometers (100 hectares = 1 km2). Cattle 
herd is measured in heads, and municipal GDP in thousands of reais of 2014. The reason we use 
the lag of GDP rather than current GDP is that the most recent available data on GDP is usually 
one year behind all the others. So, instead of losing 2015 and all of its 760 observations, we use 
lagged GDP, which is usually highly correlated and a very good proxy for current GDP.  

In order to assess the effect of policy we introduce a dummy variable Dt, that has a value 
of 0 up to 2004, when the policy was implemented, and a value of 1 from 2005 on. This dummy 
is also interacted with cattle herd, permanent and temporary crops, and soybean crops. The idea 
is  to  analyze  whether  the  PPCDAM  plan  changed  the  way  these  economic  activities  affect 
deforestation. 

Table  2  presents  the  results  of  three  different  panel  data  estimations  of  equation  (5): 
pooled  ordinary  least  squares,  fixed  effects  (without  time  dummies),  and  random  effects.  The 
three variables in the model that are time-invariant disappear when  fixed effects  are used.  We 
also exclude lagged GDP in the fixed effects estimation due to lack of statistical significance. For 
both  pooled  OLS  and  random  effects  estimations,  the  lagged  municipal  GDP  and  the  share  of 
rural population do not significantly affect deforestation. Population growth, however, is highly 
significant. The pooled OLS coefficient of 0,33 (0.34 with random effects) states that on average 
every 3% of population growth accounts for an extra deforested square kilometer every year in 
that particular municipality. Municipal area is also highly significant, and here it controls for the 
fact  that  larger  municipalities  tend  to  be  more  deforested.  So  every  extra  thousand  square 
kilometers of municipal area imply 1.1 extra square kilometer of deforestation on average (1.2 
with random effects). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                            
5 Soybean is a temporary crop. So when we aggregate all the temporary crops we can either include or exclude the 
soybean crop areas from this number. We decide to include it. So our measure of temporary crops does include 
soybean crops. That would be a problem if soybean crops were a major component of temporary crops in most 
Amazon municipalities, which could be a source of multicollinearity. It is definitely not the case. We also did all the 
regressions with a measure of permanent crops that excluded soybeans, and the results were very similar.

Overall, the results of the three estimations are similar. The estimated coefficient signals 
are roughly the same on all models, the exception being the reversal of the cattle herd coefficient 
when  fixed  effects  are  used.  Cattle  herd  having  a  negative  effect  on  deforestation  is  not  so 

 

12 

strange  as  it  seems.  Indeed,  the  typical  frontier  deforestation  has  loggers  extracting  the  most 
valuable timber before farmers burn the remaining vegetation to get agricultural land. Within a 
few  years  of  crops  the  soil  becomes  so  poor  that  the  land  has  to  be  converted  to  pasture 
(Andersen,  1996).  So,  if  large  cattle  herds  tend  to  be  in  places  where  deforestation  has  long 
occurred, and there is nothing left to deforest, that negative coefficient is perfectly reasonable. 
The same argument holds true for the negative coefficients of soybean crops. They simply mean 
that larger areas of soybean crops are located in municipalities that have long been deforested, so 
that current deforestation might be low. 

The coefficient for the PPCDAM dummy is highly significant in all models, with values 
ranging from -10 to -12. So after the policy is implemented the annual deforestation is reduced 
on  average  in  11  square  kilometers  per  municipality  (fixed  effects),  controlling  for  other 
attributes.  That  means  a  total  of  8.36  thousand  square  kilometers  per  year  for  the  760 
municipalities, and a total of 92 thousand square kilometers for the whole period of 2005 up to 
2015. But this is only a partial effect, because we interact the dummy with four other variables. 
The highly significant coefficients of all four interactions suggest that PPCDAM did change the 
way  cattle  grazing  and  agriculture  affect  deforestation.  Before  the  plan  was  introduced  every 
extra square kilometer of permanent crops and temporary crops accounted for an extra 0.57 and 
0.14 extra annual square kilometer of deforestation, respectively, for every municipality (using 
the  pooled  OLS  results).  After  the  plan  these  numbers  change  to  0.14  and  0.01,  respectively. 
Those  numbers  are  obtained  by  adding  the  coefficients  of  the  interactions  to  the  original 
coefficients of the respective variables. These results suggest that the plan forced farmers to find 
ways to increase crop areas without cutting down the forest. By the same token, every additional 
10 thousand cows would increase annual  municipal deforestation by  2.3  square  kilometers, on 
average, before the plan. That number shrunk to 0.86 after the plan, still using the pooled OLS 
regression. 

5 – Policy evaluation 

In this section we perform a counterfactual exercise that measures the overall effect of the 
PPCDAM.  The  idea  is  to  find  out  the  numbers  for  the  Amazon  deforestation  if the  PPCDAM 
was  not  implemented.  Based  on  the  three  estimation  procedures  presented  in  Table  2,  we 
calculate the predicted value for deforestation, with the dummy for the PPCDAM having a value 
of zero throughout the  whole period. Then  we  sum  for all 760 municipalities and all 11  years 
since  2005,  the  first  full  year  in  which  the  policy  is  effective,  up  to  2015,  the  last  year  of  the 
dataset. The result is an estimate of the amount of forest that was saved as a direct result of the 
policy. The estimates are 338194, 229187 and 324841, with the pooled OLS, fixed effects, and 
random  effects  models,  respectively.  Those  are  quite  large  numbers  when  compared  with  the 
100425  square  kilometers  of  deforestation  that  was  observed  for  the  period.  From  now  on  we 
will work with the most conservative of these numbers, which is the one obtained with the fixed 
effects estimation. So, based on the estimates in Table 2, we get: 

 

(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:31)<

 ! = 68.06 − 0.00034)(cid:17)**+(cid:30) ! + 0.0012&)-.(cid:10) ! + 0.000570)-.(cid:10) ! − 0.000562.(cid:9) !    (6) 

 

 

13 

Equation (6) gives the predicted deforestation of every municipality, for every year from 
2005 to 2015, had the government not implemented the PPCDAM plan. These numbers can be 
aggregated on the time and/or cross-sectional dimensions.  

There is no  upper bound on the levels of deforestation predicted. Therefore, the values 
predicted  by  equation  (6)  for  municipalities  with  critical  levels  of  deforestation  are  sometimes 
higher than the total municipal area, which obviously makes no sense. If we correct for that, and 
establish  that  the  maximum  value  for  prediction  is  the  correspondent  municipal  area,  we  find 
lower values than the ones listed above. Specifically, with fixed effects, the total saved forest in 
square kilometers becomes 196512, around 14.4% lower than the original estimate.  

Putting this number in perspective, 196 thousand square kilometers corresponds to almost 
twice the amount of actual deforestation observed in the period. The total predicted cumulative 
deforestation without the policy is 297 thousand square kilometers. So, according to this result, 
the amount of forest that was saved by the policy corresponds to 66% of the total deforestation 
that  would  have  occurred  in  the  period  from  2005  to  2015,  had  the  PPCDAM  not  been 
implemented.  The  only  other  similar  number  for  the  PPCDAM´s  effectiveness  found  in  the 
literature, to the best of our knowledge, was provided by Assunção et al. (2012). They found a 
slightly  smaller  figure  of  52.1%,  but  their  time  span  is  also  smaller,  from  2005  to  2009.6  So, 
notwithstanding the fact that the reduction in aggregate deforestation flattened out after 2011, our 
results  suggest  that  the  share  of  deforestation  avoided  by  the  policy  on  the  total  predicted 
deforestation kept rising. 

If  we  aggregate  the  data  in  the  cross-section  dimension,  we  can  compare  the  two  time 
series that together capture the effect of the policy, namely, the observed aggregate deforestation, 
and the predicted deforestation without the policy. Figure 5 presents these series. The first graph 
on the left-hand side presents the original estimate with fixed effects, and the graph on the right-
hand  side  presents  the  estimates  corrected  to  the  fact  that  municipalities  cannot  deforest  more 
than 100% of their own area.

6 According to these authors the environmental policies saved 62 thousand square kilometers of 
forest between 2005 and 2009.

Another interesting exercise is to aggregate the data on the time series dimension. So, for 
every  municipality  we  calculate  the  difference  between  the  observed  deforestation,  and  the 
deforestation  without  policy,  predicted  with  equation  (6).  We  then  sum  those  numbers  for  the 
whole  time  for  which  the  plan  has  been  operational,  from  2005  to  2015.  The  result  is  the 
predicted cumulative area of forest saved by the policy, for each municipality. In order to present 
those  numbers  on  a  map,  we  take  them  as  a  share  of  the  municipality  area.  These  results  are 
shown in Figure 6. Most of the forested areas saved by the PPCDAM are on the deforestation 
arch. There is also a visible projection of darker areas following the course of the Amazon River. 
The  predictions  of  non-deforested  areas  south  and  southeast  of  the  deforestation  arch  are 
certainly an overshoot. Those are areas in which the Amazon forest meets the Cerrado (Central 
Savannas), and there is a high proportion of municipal areas that are originally non-forested. So, 
the fact that observed deforestation was low does not necessarily mean that the PPCDAM plan 
was  effective,  but  rather  that  there  is  not  much  forest  to  be  deforested.  That  suggests  that  the 
actual number of square  kilometers saved by the plan for the entire Amazon might  be slightly 
lower than the number we have been working with.

We can also use the predictions of the forested areas saved by the plan and compare the 
2015 picture of cumulative deforestation with the cumulative deforestation that would exist had 
the plan not been enacted. Figure 7 depicts the results. The graph on the left-hand side shows the 
actual cumulative deforestation in the Amazon in 2015. The graph on the right-hand side shows 
the  counterfactual  cumulative  deforestation:    how  Amazon  would  look  like  by  2015  if  the 
PPCDAM was never implemented.

6 - Conclusion 

Understanding  the  recent  movements  in  the  deforestation  of  the  Brazilian  Amazon  is 
crucial  in  the  effort  to  preserve  this  important,  biodiverse,  rain  forest.  The  Brazilian  Amazon 
covers an area of approximately 4 million square kilometers (Olson et al., 2001), and accounts 
for  13%  of  the  world´s  biota  (Lewinsohn  and  Prado,  2005).  By  the  mid  2000’s  it  was  being 
deforested at an annual rate of 0.65%. The succeeding reduction in the deforestation brought this 
number down to approximately  0.15%,  a remarkable result that was believed to be  achievable 
only if accompanied by a considerable cutback in the Amazon’s economic activity. Surprisingly, 
it  was  achieved  amidst  a  major  worldwide  expansion  of  commodity  markets,  including  the 
markets of major commodities produced in the Amazon region.  

This  paper  analyses  the  determinants  of  deforestation  in  the  Brazilian  Amazon,  with 
particular  focus  on  the  role  played  by  a  bold  conservation  policy  introduced  by  the  federal 
government in 2004, the PPCDAM. To do so, it relies on a panel of 760 Amazon municipalities 
and  15  years  that  is  used  to  estimate  the  effects  of  traditional  deforestation  drivers,  like  cattle 
herd and soybean crops, as well as the effect of the conservation policy. The main findings are 
that  population  growth,  cattle  herd,  permanent  and  temporary  crops,  and  soybean  crops 

 

16 

significantly  affect  deforestation.  Moreover,  the  conservation  policy  significantly  reduced 
deforestation. It changed the way the forest structurally relates to fluctuations in the commodity 
markets.  With  PPCDAM,  deforestation  became  less  sensitive  to  fluctuations  in  crop  areas  and 
cattle  herds  in  the  Amazon.  In  a  counterfactual  exercise  the  results  suggest  that  the  policy 
prevented 196 thousand square kilometers of Amazon forest from being wiped out between 2005 
and  2015.  That  number  is  4.9%  of  the  entire  Brazilian  Amazon  forest.  It  is  almost  twice  the 
amount of actual deforestation that occurred in the same period.  

The  results  obtained  here  suggest  that  a  well-designed  conservation  policy  can  be  very 
effective  in  curbing  the  deforestation  process  of  rain  forests.  In  fact,  the  Brazilian  Amazon 
experience should be investigated, improved, and perhaps the main structure of a plan such as 
PPCDAM could be replicated in other rain forests that are going through deforestation processes. 
After all, 4.9% of the Amazon, along with all the biodiversity that has been preserved, in just 11 
years is a formidable gift to the future generations.
