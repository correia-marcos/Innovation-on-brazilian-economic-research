Abstract 

The two stage wage gap decomposition proposed by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2009) permits 
measuring  the  contribution  of  observable  and  unobservable  characteristics  of  the  wage  gap 
formation and evolution comparing teachers earnings in the public and private sectors from 
2006 to 2016. We found that teachers from the public sector earn more than the ones from the 
private  sector  at  mean,  median  and  quantile  10  due  to  the  composition  effect.  The  analysis 
across education levels shows that the composition effect is important to explain the wage gap 
in  Early  Childhood  Education,  while  the  structure  effect  is  more  relevant  in  the  wage  gap 
decomposition in Elementary and High School Education.

Resumo 

Para  analisar  a  diferença  salarial  entre  professores  do  setor  público  e  privado  atuando  na 
Educação Básica realizamos um método de decomposição em dois estágios proposto por Firpo, 
Fortin, and Lemieux (2009). A análise cobre o período de 2006 a 2016 para a média, mediana 
e 10o e 90o quantis. Os resultados mostram que há um crescimento da diferença salarial a favor 
do setor público em todos os pontos da distribuição, com exceção do quantil 90. Essa diferença 
se  dá  pela  diferença  de  composição  de  características.  Abrindo  a  análise  para  os  níveis  de 
educação  em  que  os  professores  atuam,  encontramos  que  a  composição  das  características 
também é um componente importante para explicar a diferença salarial na educação infantil, já 
no ensino fundamental a diferença a favor do setor público se dá pelas taxas de retorno assim 
como no ensino médio.

1.  Introduction 

What is the difference between teacher’s earnings in the private and public sector in Brazil? 
What  are  the  most  important  explanations  accounting  for  pay  differences  between  them?  Has  this 
wage  gap  increased  or  decreased  in the  past  10  years?  Is  there  any  difference  in wage  gap  across 
education levels? To answer these questions, we use a two-stage procedure to decompose differences 
and  changes  in  the  distribution  of  wages  between  sectors:  Recentered  Influence  Function  (RIF) 
proposed  by  Firpo,  Fortin,  and  Lemieux  (2009),  a  generalization  of  the  Oaxaca-Blinder 
decomposition. 

 Many studies compare public and private sector earnings in Brazil and  find that workers in 
the public sector earn higher salaries (FOGUEL et al., 2000; MACEDO, 1985; MARCONI, 2003; 
TANNEN,  1991;  TENOURY;  MENEZES-FILHO,  2017).  Bender  and  Fernandes  (2006),  for 
instance, explore schooling differential and wage inequality in the public and private sectors using 
PNADs from 1992 to 2004. The main results show a systematic and significant increase in public-
private wage differential, there is a decrease in public employment, inequality is larger in the public 
sector, and there is a convergence of the average worker’s quality between the public and the private 
sectors. 

Braga (2007) analyzes the determinants of the public-private wage gap for different levels of 
qualification for Brazilian employees. Workers with no education or low educational level earn less 
in the private sector, while workers with high human capital earn less in the public sector. The author 
also finds that there is some heterogeneity according to occupational choice. Specifically, he finds 
that workers from education careers earn more in the private sector.  

Machado and Scorzafave (2016) compare the wage gap between teachers and non-teachers in 
careers  typically  related  to  the  teaching  profession.  The  results  suggest  the  existence  of  a  wage 
differential favoring teachers, both in average and also at quantiles 10 and 50 in 2010. At quantile 90, 
there is no wage gap between teachers and non-teachers. Wage differentials are mainly explained by 
differences in returns associated with characteristics that determine wages. For instance, at quantile 
50,  being  a  public-sector  employee  is  associated  with  a  higher  wage  for  teachers  than  for  non-
teachers. 

Belluzzo, Anuatti Neto and Pazello (2005), using a quantile regression method, find that the 
wage gap is larger at the bottom of the distribution. Although the wage gap favoring the public sector 
is reversed in some specific moments of the distribution, it is observed that it continually decreases 
as we go from the bottom to the top of the distribution. 

When  decomposing  wage  gaps,  the  most  common  method  used  is  the  standard  Oaxaca-
Blinder decomposition. In order to study the public-private wage gap, we take one step further and, 
in addition to explaining differences in means, we analyze the wage gap using other distributional 
statistics. The method proposed by Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2009) allows one to decompose wage 
differentials at any quantile of the wage distribution.  

Also, our research innovates by doing an analysis over time with census data. Finally, we also 
investigate  if  the  wage  gap  has  a  different  behavior  across  education  levels  in  which  teachers  are 
employed over time. As the state and local government shares the provision of education levels with 
the federal government, there are potential differences that may arise due to different contexts. 

The  main  results  show  that  the  evolution  of  the  wage  gap  has  favored  the  public  sector 
between  2006  and  2016.  While  at  the  mean,  median  and  10th  quantile  the  wage  gap  increased,  at 
quantile 90, where the wage gap was negative in 2006, the difference has been reduced over time. 
The decomposition analysis shows that this is because of the composition effect. Further dividing the 
composition effect to investigate the contribution of each single covariate, we found that  tenure is 
mainly responsible for the wage gap path observed in the period. 

We  also  found  that  there  are  large  differences  across  education  levels.  While  the  Early 
Childhood Education is the level in which teachers’ features are more important to the formation of

the wage gap, in Elementary Education, the wage gap increase favoring the public sector is due to the 
wage structure effect. However, in High School, the wage structure effect favors the private sector. 

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes census data used with 
sample restrictions  and definitions adopted. Section  3 presents teachers’ characteristics  by sectors, 
while  section  4  analyzes  wage  distribution  over  time.  Section  5  outlines  our  empirical  strategy. 
Section 6 discusses wage gap decomposition between sectors, while Section 7 discusses wage gap 
decomposition  between  sectors  across  education  levels.  Finally,  Section  8  presents  our  main 
conclusions. 

 

2.  Data source, sample restrictions and definitions 

This paper uses census data assembled by the Ministry of Labor as data source. RAIS (Relação 
Anual  de  Informações  Sociais)  is  an  annual  dataset  containing  individual  information  about  all 
workers employed in the formal sector. It is the employer who provides information on worker’s age, 
gender, race, schooling, tenure at the firm, monthly wage, and number of (weekly) hours in contract. 
There are two wage variables: the average wage received during the year, and the wage received in 
December.  

Also, there is information about the job executed by workers that is comparable to ISCO-88 
(four-digit level), which is used to identify teachers. On the firm side, RAIS provides information on 
plant size, sector of activity (comparable to ISIC/CIIU1, used to identify the education sector firms), 
public-private ownership categories, and firm location (municipality). 

To identify teachers in the database, to separate teachers employed in the public sector from 
those  ones  employed  in  private  sector  and  to  restrict  the  sample  to  teachers  teaching  in  Basic 
Education  we  follow  a  technical  report  from  the  National  Institute  of  Educational  Studies  (INEP, 
2017),  an  agency  linked  to  the  Ministry  of  Education.  The  occupation  classification  previously 
mentioned  allows  us  to  identify  teachers  as  well  as  the  grade  each  one  teaches:  Early  Childhood 
Education  (which  includes  pre-school  and  kindergarten),  Elementary  Education  (1st  grade  to  9th 
grade),  High  School  Education  (10th  grade  to  12th  grade),  or  others  (which  includes  Vocational 
Education,  Special  Education  for  disabled  children  in  need  of  special  attention  and  teachers  from 
High Education working in areas of practice within teaching)2. 

To identify whether a teacher works in the public or the private sector, we use the legal status 
of  the  school.  RAIS  provides  this  information  through  a  classification  from  the  Brazilian  Census 
Bureau (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, IBGE) that organizes entities according to its 
legal status. There are five categorical groups: Public Administration, Business Entities, Non-Profit 
Organizations,  Individuals  and  International  Organizations,  and  Other  Extraterritorial  Institutions. 
We define public sector as the one composed by Public Administration and Public and Semi-public 
Companies from Business Entities, while Business Entities and some Non-Profit Organizations3 are 
defined as private sector. The other categorical groups are dropped off from the sample. Besides, to 
ensure we are selecting the correct entities, we look for companies doing specific activities.  Using 
the entity’s sector of activity, we restrict the sample to individuals working in Education and other 
activities related to Public Administration, as defined in the INEP report. 

Our research covers the Brazilian job market from 2006 to 2016. The 2006 wave is first one 
that contains all the variables that allow us to have the same set of control variables until 2016, the 
most recent dataset available. We focus on workers who were employed on December 31st of each 
year, which means that we exclude individuals who were employed during the year but lost their jobs

2 According to INEP this occupation could include teachers from Federal Institutes teaching in Basic Education.

Social Service, 3220 Religious Organization and 3999 Private Association.

at  some  point.  In  order  to  have  wages  measured  at  the  same  point  in  time  and  not  to  have  wage 
variation due to the fact the workers present different periods of employment over the year,  we use 
the wage earned in December to calculate the individual hourly wage instead of using the average 
annual wage4. We use a sample of workers aged between 18 and 70 with positive earnings. The age 
range is restricted because the public sector has a compulsory retirement rule and a minimum age for 
admission to employment. The next section presents some descriptive statistics on our sample. 

 

3.  Teacher's characteristics 

This section describes teachers’ characteristics using the 2006 and 2016 waves (the starting 
and final time points of our sample). Table 1 shows that we had more than 2.1 million teachers in 
2006, and this number increased 17% over a decade, reaching 2.5 million in 2016.   While 86% of 
teachers were in the public sector in 2006, in 2016 the percentage decreased to 81%.

Table 2 presents some descriptive statistics of teachers’ characteristics by sector in 2006 and 
2016. As one can see, both average wage and number of hours are larger in the public sector. On the 
other hand, while wage dispersion is higher in the public sector, the standard deviation of working 
hours is larger in the private sector. We will discuss wage data in further details in the next section. 

The typical teacher in the public sector in 2006 is a non-white woman aged 40 with a college 
degree teaching elementary school students. A decade later, the characteristics are almost the same, 
except  for  the  fact  that  the  percentage  of  teachers  with  a  college  degree  increased  28  percentage 
points. It should be noticed that since 1996, all teachers must have a college degree to be eligible for 
admission as a teacher. The ones who were hired before 1996 are allowed to work regularly, that is 
why there are some teachers without a college degree.  

In the private sector, teachers are younger, and there is a larger percentage of men (around 
one quarter). Schooling distribution is similar, but distribution across grades which they teach is a 
little  bit  different,  with  a  higher  percentage  in  early  education.  The  biggest  difference  between 
teachers in the public and private sector is race: 65% in the private sector are white in 2016, against 
5% in the public sector.  

As  expected,  tenure  at  firm  is  longer  in  the  public  sector  where  teachers  in  2006  were 
employed in the same firm for 10.6 years on average and it increases up to 11.7 years in 2016, while 
in the private sector tenure was 4.8 years in 2006 and 4.9 years in 2016. 

 
 

                                                 
4 According to General Register of Employee and Unemployed [CAGED], December is the month of the year 
presenting the lowest net rate of job creation. However, this is not a big issue in the present context because the month of 
analysis is fixed.

4.  Wage distribution 

As  we  are  performing  a  wage  decomposition  analysis  using  data  from  2006  to  2016,  this 
section presents teachers’ wage distribution by sector for the whole period. The idea is to highlight 
differences and similarities in wage distribution to support the following wage gap analysis. As shown 
in the previous section, there are differences concerning the number of working hours, so from now 
on, when we talk about wages we are referring to (log of) hourly wage. 

Figure 1 plots mean and median wages for the whole period by sector. First of all, mean and 
median wages are larger in the public sector even after taking into account the number of hours in 
contract. Second, one can see that public sector wages increased more than wages in the private sector 
throughout the decade. The period from 2006 to 2012 is particularly important for wage gap increase. 
The mean wage of teachers in the public sector increased 15% (in terms of log points), while private 
sector wage increased 7.8% in the same period. Third, statistics show that median wage trajectories 
across sectors are even more different. The figure shows  that the median wage path in the private 
sector is flatter than in the public sector, which means that the wage gap increased more in terms of 
median wage over the period in comparison to average wages.

Figure 1 – Log hourly wage mean and median, by sector 

 

 
Figure 2 presents teachers’ wage distribution by sector and year. The figure confirms that the 
wage distribution in the public sector is symmetric around its mean in the entire period, a feature that 
was expected since average and median wages are practically the same. On the other hand, it is shown 
that  the  private  wage  distribution  is  right-skewed,  meaning  that  there  are  more  top  salaries  in  the 
private sector.  

Also, it is clear that the wage dispersion is higher in the private sector. Although we observe 
that the private sector’s wage variability was getting smaller since 2006, at the end of the period the 
interquartile interval was still lower in the public sector. In spite of that, we observe a slight decrease 
in dispersion throughout the period for both sectors.

This  section and  the  previous  one  showed  that  there  are  important  differences  in teachers’ 
characteristics between public and private sectors. This is expected since i) admission to the public 
sector is different from admission to a private school, and ii) wages in the public sector are set by 
strict  rules  and  regulations  by  the  government  which,  in  general,  do  not take  into account  teacher 
performance. In the next section, we present the methodology we use to analyze the wage gap between 
sectors over the last ten years. 

 

5.  Methodology 

To understand which factors are driving the changes in teachers’ wage gap in recent years, we 
implement a decomposition analysis based on Oaxaca (1973), Blinder (1973) and Firpo, Fortin and 
Lemieux (2009). The method allows us to measure the contribution of observable and unobservable 
characteristics to the wage gap formation and evolution. Also, the method goes beyond the traditional 
analysis of the difference in the means of wages by allowing us to evaluate the wage gap at different 
points  of  the  wage  distribution,  which  is  precisely  the  goal  of  this  paper.  The  main  hypothesis 
supporting this goal is that wage gap decomposition could present different patterns when performed 
at  different  points  of  the  distribution  from  the  conclusions  one  could  obtain  by  explaining  the 
difference in the means. 

The  standard  Oaxaca-Blinder  decomposition  can  be  interpreted  as  a  specific  case  of  the 
decomposition  method  proposed  by  Firpo,  Fortin  and  Lemieux  (2009).  We  are  interested  in 
decomposing  the  wage  gap,  Δ𝜏,  where  𝜏  represents  the  mean  or  any  other  quantile  of  the  wage 
distribution. As in the standard case, the wage gap can be decomposed in two parts as shown in the 
following equation: 

Δ𝜏 = Δ𝑆 + Δ𝑋  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

 

7 

where Δ𝑆 is the change in the wage structure while keeping the distribution of the vector of 
characteristics 𝑋 constant (wage structure effect), and Δ𝑋 is the change in the distribution of 𝑋 while 
keeping  the  wage  structure  constant  (composition  effect).  Under  linearity  and  identification 
assumptions, Equation (1) reduces to the standard components of the Oaxaca-Blinder method when 
explaining mean values.  

The  decomposition  is  implemented  in  two  stages.  The  first  stage  is  the  estimation  of  the 
weighting function used to reweight the mean wage (or median or other quantile) of each group, a 
step necessary to identify the parameters of interest (the two parts of the wage gap in  Eq. 1). The 
distributional statistics can be computed using a plug-in approach; then, they are used to compute the 
wage structure and composition effects. The second stage is the estimation of the contribution of each 
covariate  to  each  effect.  This  is  implemented  using  a  Recentered  Influence  Function  (RIF)  that 
linearly approximates a non-linear functional of the distribution. Using this transformed variable as 
the dependent variable in OLS regressions, one can estimate the regression coefficients used in the 
decomposition analysis.  

𝑅𝐼𝐹 = 𝛼𝑠 + 𝑋𝑖𝑠𝛽𝑠 + 𝜀𝑖𝑠 

The OLS regression is a Mincerian equation as the following: 
𝑤𝑖𝑠
where 𝑤𝑖𝑠

 

 

 

 

 

𝑅𝐼𝐹 is the transformed hourly wage of teacher 𝑖 working in sector 𝑠 (value 0 for public 
sector and 1 for private sector); 𝑋𝑖𝑠 is a vector of teacher’s characteristics, which includes schooling 
(four categories – under elementary education omitted), age (as proxy for work experience, with a 
quadratic relation with the dependent variable), current job tenure in months, a dummy for gender 
(indicating  men),  a  dummy  for  race  (indicating  Whites),  dummy  variables  for  geographic  regions 
(North omitted), and a categorical variable indicating to which grade the teacher teaches to  (Other 
omitted).  𝛽𝑠  is  the  vector  of  parameters  to  be  estimated  and  𝜀𝑖𝑠  represents  the  unobserved 
characteristics (𝐸(𝜀𝑠|𝑋𝑠) = 0). 

 

 

 

(2) 

In sum, the idea is to reweight the dependent variable at the distribution point 𝜏 through the 
RIF  and  then  perform  the  standard  Oaxaca-Blinder  decomposition.  We  are  going  to  perform  two 
decompositions. In the first one we decompose the wage statistic to analyze the differences between 
the public and private sectors, our main exercise. In the other we further investigate the differences 
between sectors by decomposing the wage statistic separately for each educational level. In addition 
to  present  the  decomposition  results  to  explain  differences  in  the  means,  we  perform  the 
decomposition analysis at three quantiles: 10th, 50th and 90th. 

 

6.  Decomposition by sector 

This section presents the results of teachers’ wage gap decomposition. As highlighted before, 
the analysis covers the period between 2006 and 2016, and it is performed to explain differences in 
means as well as at three difference quantiles: 10th, 50th and 90th. The question underlying the analysis 
is: how much would teachers in the private sector be paid if they  were rewarded according to the 
wage structure for teachers in the public sector? 

Figure 3 summarizes the main results. Each panel reports the wage gap for each distributional 
statistic  (connected  line)  as  well  as  the  contributions  of  the  composition  (gray  bar)  and  the  wage 
structure (white bar) effects for the formation of the wage gap. Notice that in each year the sum of 
the bars is equal to the wage gap. 

In general, the decomposition results show that both composition and wage structure effects 
favor teachers in the public sector, meaning that public sector’s teachers have more characteristics 
associated with higher wages and that these characteristics are better paid in the public than in the 
private sector. The exception is the decomposition of the 90th quantile, which will be analyzed below.  
The decomposition of the mean shows that the contribution of the composition effect increases 
over the years until 2012, both in absolute and relative terms. As the wage gap follows a similar path, 

 

8 

it seems that the wage gap widening is associated with a change in the pool of teachers in the public 
sector related to teachers in the private sector. In the last two years, the relative importance of the 
composition effect increased although the wage gap remained the same. A similar pattern is observed 
for the decomposition of the median. The absolute contribution of the wage structure effect remained 
stable since 2007, while the relative contribution of the composition effect increased over time.  

The wage gap at the 10th quantile also favors teachers in the public sector, but it is larger  in 
comparison to the mean and median. In addition, the same increase in the wage gap observed for the 
previous  distributional  statistics  for  the  2006-2012  period  occurs  for  teachers  at  this  quantile.  A 
relative increase of the composition effect in explaining the wage gap is also observed. In the end of 
the period, its relative importance is similar to the importance of the wage structure effect. Thus, even 
for low-paid teachers, the public sector used to pay more than the private sector because of the wage 
structure effect and not due to differences in observable characteristics. However, in the last few years 
the composition effect became more important to explain the wage gap than the unexplained factor. 
At the top of the wage distribution, results differ from previous ones. As one can see in the 
panel for the 90th quantile, the wage gap is negative, which means that teachers in the private sector 
earn higher wages than teachers in the public sector. This is explained by the rules that regulate wages 
in the public sector and impose a wage cap (the same is true for the other extreme of the distribution, 
where rules set a minimum wage called “piso salarial”). The contribution of each effect for wage gap 
formation  also  differs at  the  top  of  the  distribution in comparison  to  other  distributional  statistics. 
While the wage structure contributes to increase the wage gap in favor of the private sector, if only 
the composition effect was taken into account, the wage gap would favor the public sector. This is 
valid for the whole period, but, again, the composition effect became more important over time.

In  order  to  understand  the  changes  better,  one  can  look  at  the  contribution  of  each  single 
covariate to the composition and wage structure effects. Figure 7 and 8 in the Appendix show these 
contributions for each case, respectively. In relation to the composition effect, we see that tenure is 
the variable that contributes the most to the positive difference in favor of public sector, which is 
probably  related  to  the  job  stability  the  public  sector  offers  to  its  employees.  Age  comes  second, 
followed by schooling after 2011. It is interesting to observe that schooling had its signal changed in 
the period, suggesting that the pool of teachers in the private sector was better qualified before 2012. 
The pattern is similar for all distributional statistics. 

The wage structure effect (Figure 8) presents a very distinct scenario. In the decomposition of 
the mean and median, age and schooling have a negative effect, i.e. the return to age and schooling 
is higher in the private sector. On the other hand, at quantile 10, both have a positive effect. And at 
quantile  90,  while  schooling  loses  relative  importance  over  the  period,  age  effect  changes  from 
positive to negative. Also, tenure does not contribute for the wage structure effect at all. Finally, the 
education  levels,  which  was  not  that  important  for  the  composition  effect  (except  for  the  90th 
quantile),  has  an  important  contribution  to  the  wage  structure  effect,  except  for  quantile  10. 
Conditional on other covariates, the positive contribution means that teachers in the public sector are 
better paid in their respective education level. 

This section presented evidence that the higher the salary, the larger the importance of the 
wage structure effect relative to the composition effect for the formation of the wage  gap. This is 
particularly true at the 90th quantile, where the wage structure effect is negative, favoring the private 
sector. There is also evidence that the education level plays an important role in the wage structure 
effect;  for  this  reason,  we  will  further  investigate  the  public-private  wage  gap  by  performing  a 
decomposition analysis across education levels. 

 

7.  Decomposition across education levels 

This  section  presents  the  results  of  the  decomposition  analysis  of  the  teachers’  wage  gap 
according to the education levels which they tutor. According to the Brazilian Federal Constitution 
and the Law n° 9,394 1996, local governments are mainly responsible for providing the Elementary 
and Early Childhood Education while state governments are responsible for High School Education. 
Therefore,  for  Early  Childhood  Education  and  Elementary  Education  we  analyze  the  wage  gap 
between teachers from local public schools and private schools, and for High School, we analyze the 
wage gap between state public schools and private schools. 

Table 3 shows observable characteristics separately for each education level by sector in 2006 
and 2016. As we can observe, like the overall statistics by sector presented in Section 3, the public 
sector pays better wages and has older teachers with longer tenure at firm and a smaller percentage 
of Whites than the private sector in all education levels. The number of hours in contract in Early 
Childhood  Education  is  similar  between  sectors,  but  in  Elementary  and  High  School  Education 
teachers work less hours in the private sector. Over time, one can see that the average age and the 
percentage of teachers with a college degree increased in both sectors, with mean wage increasing as 
well. 

In 2006, teachers teaching preschool children had more schooling than the elementary school 
teachers  in  the  public  sector,  a  pattern  that  was  not  observed  in  the  private  sector.  Actually,  as 
mentioned previously, there was a big change in terms of formal schooling. Teachers from public 
schools closed the schooling gap observed in 2006 for elementary and high school grades.

The wage decomposition results for teachers in Early Childhood Education are presented in 
Figure 4. As one can see, the public-private wage gap for all distributional statistics is larger than the 
one we have been discussing so far for the whole sample. This is interesting by itself because it says 
that the top wages are in the public sector, something that is not expected due to the rules governing 
wages in public sector. There is some variation in the wage gap until 2012, but it remained relatively 
stable since then, being larger at the median in comparison to the tails.

Figure 4 – Wage gap decomposition in Early Childhood Education 

 

 
In  explaining  differences  in  wages,  it  is  shown  that  the  contribution  of  each  effect  varies 
according to the distributional statistic. At the 10th quantile, earnings in the public sector are higher 
because teachers in this sector possess characteristics that are more associated with higher wages. On 
the other extreme, at quantile 90, the composition effect still prevails, although the importance of the 
rate of return have increased considerably. But it is at the median that the wage structure effect matters 
the most: on average, the characteristics included in the analysis are better paid in the public sector.  
Further  dividing  the  wage  gap  to  investigate the  contribution  of  each  single  covariate5,  we 
found that tenure and schooling are the most important variables for the composition effect. For the 
wage structure effect, age presents the largest contribution, which means that the return to experience 
plays an important role. The return to schooling is also important, but only for the 10th quantile. It 
should be highlighted that age and schooling effect contributes to reduce the wage gap favoring the 
public sector. What drives the positive wage gap are  omitted factors captured by the constant term 
(promotion rules, for instance). 

Figure 5 presents the wage gap decomposition for Elementary Education teachers. As shown, 
the scenario is completely different from the one just analyzed. First of all, the wage gap is increasing 
in favor of the public sector over time (it is being reduced at the 90th quantile). Also, it is clear that 
the  wage  gap  comes  from  the  wage  structure  effect,  although  the  composition  effect  plays  an 
important role at the top of the distribution. 

At quantile 90, the observed reduction in wage gap (favoring public sector) is associated with 
a relative decrease in the wage structure effect. In fact, it should also be noticed that the composition

effect is increasing its share over time, meaning that the public sector is relatively improving teachers’ 
characteristics. In spite of that, generally speaking, the public sector offers a larger rate of return. 

As  the  composition  effect  is  small,  in  terms  of  covariates  contribution,  we  analyze  the 
contribution to the wage structure effect. What we found is that the difference favoring the public 
sector comes from omitted factors. Again, the return to experience (age) is what makes the difference 
in terms of contribution favoring the private sector. 

Figure 5 – Wage gap decomposition in Elementary Education 

 

Last, but not least, the wage gap decomposition for High School teachers is reported in Figure 
6. While wage gap is positive at the 10th quantile, teachers in private sector present larger wages than 
teachers in public sector at the other quantiles, while some variation is observed for the average wage.  
The  decomposition  shows  that the  composition  effect  almost  always  favors  teachers  in the 
public  sector,  something  that  was  also  observed  in  early  education.  However,  except  for  the  10 th 
quantile, the wage structure effect is always negative and is relatively large, resulting in the negative 
wage gap, especially at the top of the wage distribution.  

The contribution of covariates to the composition effect varies in the case of High School. At 
the 90th quantile, we observe regional effects contributing to increase the wage gap, and schooling 
favoring the private sector. For the other distributional statistics, the main contribution comes from 
tenure and sometimes gender. Again, there are omitted factors (constant) present in the wage structure 
effect  favoring  the  public  sector  over  the  whole  period,  but  its  share  is  relatively  smaller  in 
comparison to what was observed for the other education levels. Age, schooling and regional effects 
contribute to the formation of a negative wage gap.

This section showed that it is important to analyze teachers tutoring distinct grades separately. 
This provides a better understanding of the whole picture in terms of public-private sector analysis. 
Early  Childhood  Education  is  the  level  in  which  teachers’  features  are  more  important  to  the 
formation  of  the  wage  gap.  On  the  other  hand,  in  Elementary  Education,  the  wage  gap  increases 
favoring the public sector due to the wage structure effect, while this effect favors the private sector 
in High School. 

 

 

8.  Final remarks 

Our aim was to estimate the wage gap decomposition between teachers from Basic Education 
in  the  public  and  private  sectors  to  explain  how  much  it  comes  from  changes  in  individual 
characteristics (composition effect) and how much is based on market returns that cannot be explained 
by individual characteristics (structure effect). Thus, using a two-stage decomposition we estimated 
the wage gap at mean and three quantiles of the wage distribution: 10th, 50th and 90th. 

The main results showed that the  evolution of the public-private wage gap has favored the 
public sector. While at the mean, median and 10th quantile the wage gap increased, at quantile 90, 
where  the  wage  gap  was  negative  in  2006,  the  difference  has  been  reduced  over  time.  The 
decomposition  analysis  shows  that  this  is  because  of  the  composition  effect.  Further  dividing  the 
composition effect to investigate the contribution of each single covariate, we found that tenure is 
mainly responsible for the wage gap path observed in the period. 

This paper presented evidence that the higher the salary, the larger the importance of the wage 
structure  effect  relative  to  the  composition  effect  for  the  formation  of  the  wage  gap.  This  is 

 

14 

particularly true at the 90th quantile, where the wage structure effect is negative, favoring the private 
sector. There is also evidence that the education level plays an important role in the wage structure 
effect; for this reason, we investigated the public-private wage gap by performing a decomposition 
analysis across education levels. 

We  found  that  there  are  large  differences  across  education  levels.  While  Early  Childhood 
Education is the level in which teachers’ features are more important to the formation of the wage 
gap, in Elementary Education, the wage gap increase favoring the public sector is due to the wage 
structure effect. However, in High School, the wage structure effect favors the private sector. 

This  analysis  showed  that  it  is  important  to  analyze  teachers  tutoring  distinct  grades 
separately. This provides a better understanding of the whole picture in terms of public-private sector 
analysis.
