Abstract: We derive a best-reply monetary policy when the confidence by price setters on 
the monetary authority’s commitment to price level targeting is incomplete and sticky. We 
find that complete confidence (or full credibility) is not a necessary condition for reaching 
a price level  target.  In  fact,  it is  the reaching  of a price level  target  for long  enough that 
rather ensures the conquering of the greatest possible confidence. Evidently, this result has 
relevant implications for the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit of price stability. One 
such implication is that setting a price level target matters more as a way to give monetary 
policy a sharper focus on price stability than as a device to conquer credibility. As regards 
the conquering of credibility, it turns out that actions speak louder than words.

Resumo:  Derivamos  uma  política  monetária  de  melhor  resposta  quando  a  confiança  dos 
formadores de preços no comprometimento da autoridade monetária com a meta de nível 
de preços é incompleta  e rígida. Concluímos  que a  confiança  completa (ou credibilidade 
plena) não é uma condição necessária para o alcance da meta de nível de preços. De fato, é 
o  alcance  da  meta  de  nível  de  preços  por  um  período  longo  o  suficiente  que  assegura  a 
conquista  da  maior  confiança  possível.  Evidentemente,  esse  resultado  tem  implicações 
relevantes para a conduta da política monetária em busca da estabilidade de preços. Uma 
dessas  implicações  é  que  a  fixação  de  uma  meta  de  nível  de  preços  importa  mais  como 
uma forma de dar à política monetária um foco mais estrito na estabilidade de preços do 
que como  um  mecanismo de conquista de credibilidade. No que diz respeito à conquista 
de credibilidade, segue-se que ações falam mais alto do que palavras.

1. Introduction 

The  issue  of  time  inconsistency  has  been  extensively  studied  in  the  monetary 
policy literature following Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983). A 
central result emerging from these studies is that monetary policy will be more effective if 
it  is  both  transparent  and  credible.  Meanwhile,  a  credible  monetary  policy  is  believed  to 
feature  pursuit  of  an  explicit  target,  and  authors  such  as  Svensson  (1999)  and  Ball, 
Mankiw  and  Reis  (2005)  claim  that  price  level  targeting  is  the  optimal monetary  policy. 
However,  although  several  empirical  studies  find  that  an  explicit  target  leads  to  superior 
monetary policy outcomes, it is  still an unsettled issue whether it is  targeting per se or a 
sharper focus of monetary policy on price stability that is commendable. 

In this context, this paper derives a best-reply monetary policy when price-setters’ 
confidence  on  the  commitment  of  the  monetary  authority  to  price  level  targeting  is  both 
incomplete and sticky. As the optimal price of an individual firm depends positively upon 
the other firms’ prices, there is therefore strategic complementarity in price setting. While 
the  corresponding  foresight  problem  can  be  solved  for  sure  by  paying  an  optimization 
cost,  a  rule-of-thumb,  costless  but  unsure  strategy  is  to  confidently  use  the  price  level 
target  periodically  announced  by  the  monetary  authority  in  seeking  to  set  the  optimal 
individual price. As a result, strategic complementarity in price setting generates strategic 
complementarity in confidence holding by price setters. 

The  distribution  of  foresight  strategies  across  firms  (or  the  state  of  confidence  in 
the  price  level  targeting)  follows  an  evolutionary  dynamic,  with  finite-horizon  firms 
periodically revising their strategies in response to the payoffs they earn. Meanwhile, the 
infinite-horizon  monetary  authority  uses  best-reply  monetary  policy  to  manage  the 
confidence  held  by  price  setters.  As  it  turns  out,  when  such  an  evolutionary  game  of 
conquering confidence is  subject  to  exogenous perturbations analogous  to  mutations in a 
biological  system,  confidence  is  not  fully  conquered  but  the  price  level  target  is 
nonetheless  continuously  reached.  Absent  such  exogenous  perturbations,  however,  the 
continuous  reaching  of  the  price  level  target  ensures  that  complete  confidence  (or  full 
credibility) is eventually conquered. Therefore, our central analytical result, which carries 
significant policy implications, is that complete confidence is not a necessary condition for 
the reaching of a price level target. Indeed, it is the reaching of a price level target for long 
enough that rather ensures the conquering of the greatest possible confidence. 

2. Structure of the model 

Consider  a  monopolistically  competitive  economy  populated  by  a  continuum  of 
firms as in Ball and Romer (1991). In their model money is introduced by assuming that it 
is a means of exchange required for transactions, which allows taking the money supply as 
a proxy for the nominal aggregate demand. We draw on the model developed in Ball and 
Romer  (1991)  due  to  its  focus  on  the  product  market  (the  economy  is  populated  by 
yeoman farmers who sell differentiated goods produced with their own labor and purchase 

 

2 

the products of all other farmers) and its assumption of a continuum of firms, which is a 
more convenient structure for the game-theoretic modeling developed in what follows. 

As  in  this  monopolistically  competitive  economy  the  optimal  individual  price 
depends positively upon the other firms’ prices, there is strategic complementarity in price 
setting.  A  fraction 
  of  price  setters  trust  the  commitment  of  the  monetary 

authority to price level targeting and solve their foresight problem by taking the target as 
the expected aggregate price level needed to set the optimal individual price conditional on 
this information (we call them confident firms). What we are suggesting here is that: (a) in 
general, by specifying transparent policy rules, policy makers can perform an intrinsically 
useful function by creating conventional anchors for expectations formation; and (b) price 
level target – the pursuit of desirable inflation enshrined in a clearly announced target that 
policy makers credibly and accountably commit to achieve – exemplifies the creation of a 
conventional  anchor  for  expectations  by  policy  makers.  The  remaining  fraction 
  of 
price setters, by not trusting the monetary authority’s commitment to price level targeting, 
rather  solves  the  same  foresight  problem  by  paying  a  cost  to  perfectly  predict  the 
aggregate price level and, accordingly, set the optimal individual price (we call them non-
confident firms). 

In fact, Diron and Mojon (2005) use data for seven inflation targeting countries to 
provide evidence that the forecast error incurred when assuming that future inflation will 
be equal to the inflation target announced by the central bank is typically at least as small 
as  (and  often  smaller  than)  the  forecast  errors  of  model-based  and  published  inflation 
forecasts.  Meanwhile,  Brazier  et  al.  (2008)  develop  a  model  in  which  agents  use  two 
heuristics to forecast inflation: one is based on one-period lagged inflation, the other on an 
inflation  target  announced  by  the  central  bank  (which  is  the  steady-state  value  of 
inflation).  Agents  switch  between  these  heuristics  based  on  an  imperfect  assessment  of 
how each has performed in  the past.  Agents  observe such performance with  some noise, 
but the better the true past performance of a heuristic, the greater chance there is that an 
agent  uses  it  to  make  the  next  period’s  forecast.  The  authors  find  that,  on  average,  the 
majority  of  agents  use  the  inflation-target  heuristic,  even  though  there  are  times  when 
everyone does, and times when no one does. While Brazier et al. (2008) embed those two 
forecasting  heuristics  in  a  monetary  overlapping-generations  model  and  heuristic 
switching  is  described  by  a  discrete  choice  model,  in  this  paper  a  different  pair  of 
forecasting  heuristics  is  embedded  in  a  macroeconomic  model  featuring  a  monetary 
authority  that  conducts  a  best-reply  monetary  policy  and  private  decision  makers  switch 
between  heuristics  based  on  evolutionary  dynamics  with  and  without  exogenous 
perturbations analogous to mutations in a biological system. De Grauwe (2011) develops a 
macro  model  in  which  agents  have  cognitive  limitations  and  use  simple  but  biased 
heuristics to forecast future inflation. The author follows Brazier et al. (2008) in allowing 
for  two  inflation  forecasting  rules.  One  heuristic  is  based  on  the  announced  inflation 
target,  while  the  other  heuristic  uses  last  period’s  inflation  to  forecast  next  period’s 
inflation.  The  market  forecast  is  a  weighted  average  of  these  two  forecasts,  with  these 
weights  being  subject  to  predictor  selection  dynamics  based  on  discrete  choice  theory.

endogenous and self-fulfilling waves of optimism and pessimism, the model of this paper 
explores  whether  there  is  convergence  towards  an  equilibrium  consistent  with  the  price 
level targeted by policy makers when private decision makers switch between forecasting 
heuristics based on evolutionary dynamics. 

This  paper  is  also  related  to  Arifovic  et  al.  (2010),  who  investigate  the  role  of 
announcements by policy makers as a means to sustain a Pareto superior macroeconomic 
outcome. Each private agent can choose in any period between two strategies: believe, that 
is,  act  as  if  the  policy  announcement  was  true;  or  not  believe,  and  compute  the  best 
possible  forecast  of  the  policy  maker’s  next  action.  In  each  period,  word  of  mouth 
information exchange allows a fraction of the agents to compare their last-period payoffs 
with  the  ones  obtained  by  agents  who  followed  the  other  strategy,  with  each  agent  then 
adopting  the  strategy  that  provided  the  highest  payoff.  Therefore,  the  proportion  of 
believers may change over time and can be interpreted as a measure of the policy maker’s 
credibility. However, while in Arifovic et al. (2010) the policy maker has limited abilities 
for  dynamic  optimization  and  forecasting,  and  uses  individual  evolutionary  learning  to 
improve  his  strategy,  in  this  paper  the  policy  maker  performs  dynamic  optimization 
knowing the evolutionary dynamics that governs the distribution of forecasting strategies 
in the population of agents. Moreover, in this paper a slightly different pair of forecasting 
strategies  is  embedded  in  a  macroeconomic  model  featuring  a  monetary  authority  that 
computes  the  best-reply  monetary  policy  and  private  agents  switch  between  strategies 
based  on  evolutionary  dynamics  with  and  without  mutation.  Also,  while  the  dynamic 
extension  set  forth  in  Arifovic  et  al.  (2010)  is  an  agent-based  model  of  a  more  complex 
environment whose results have to be derived through simulation, in the model below all 
results are derived analytically. 

The optimal individual price, 

, which is the price set by non-confident firms at a 

cost,  is  given  as  in  Ball  and  Romer  (1991,  p.  542,  eq.  11),  varying  positively  with  the 
actual aggregate price level P and the (publicly known) nominal stock of money, 

: 

(1) 

 

, 

where 

, 

, 

  and 

  is  a  constant  denoting  the 

elasticity  of  each  individual  price  with  respect  to  the  actual  aggregate  price  level.  Given 
the functional form of the utility function adopted by Ball and Romer (1991, p. 540, eq. 1), 
the  parameter 
  depends  positively  on  the  elasticity  of  substitution  between  any  two 

goods and negatively on the rate of change of the marginal disutility of labor. 

 

Meanwhile,  confident  firms  follow  the  costless  but  unsure  strategy  of  using  the 

price  level  target  periodically  announced  by  the  monetary  authority, 

,  to  predict  the 

optimal individual price

.  Therefore,  while  in  Ball  and  Romer  (1991)  the 

alternative  strategy  to  paying  an  exogenously  fixed  cost  of  adjusting  prices  is  to  keep 
prices unchanged, here the corresponding strategy is to set prices using the other publicly 

announced policy  variable, 

 (whose reach, however,  unlike  any implicit target  for  the 

publicly known 

, can be confirmed only after all prices have been set). 

Based on Ball and Romer (1991, p. 541, eq. (6)), the aggregate price level, 

, is 
,  and  the 

approximated  by  the  geometric  average  of  the  price  set  by  confident  firms, 

price set by non-confident firms,

Substituting (1) and (2) in (3), we obtain: 

(4) 

 

. 

Therefore, the aggregate price level is a weighted average between 

 and 

. Note that 

as 

  converges  to  one,  the  aggregate  price  level  converges  to 

  (or, 

equivalently, 

).  Meanwhile,  as 

  converges  to  zero,  the  aggregate  price 

level  converges  to 

  (or,  equivalently, 

),  which  is  (per  (1))  the  symmetric 

Nash  equilibrium  price.  Consequently,  when  all  firms  confidently  follow  the  price  level 
target announced by the monetary authority in seeking to establish the optimal individual

 is the elasticity of substitution between any two goods. As in a point in time there is a fraction 

  of  confident  firms  and  a  fraction 

  of  non-confident  firms,  the  expression  above  can  be  used  to 

express the general price level as follows: 

 

 

Note that: 

By applying the L’Hôpital rule, we get:

For 

 sufficiently close to one, which we assume, it follows that 

. A similar approximation is 

rather assumed in Blanchard and Fischer (1989, section 8.2) in a simplified version of the monopolistically 
competitive model set forth in Blanchard and Kiyotaki (1987).

),  the  monetary  authority  has  to  set 

  for  the  symmetric  Nash 

equilibrium price to obtain. 

While the distribution of foresight strategies 

 is given in the short run, it 

varies  over  time  according  to  an  evolutionary  dynamic,  with  firms  periodically  revising 
their  strategies  in  response  to  changes  in  expected  payoffs.  A  non-confident  firm,  by 
setting  the  actual  optimal  individual  price,  does  not  suffer  any  loss  caused  by  foresight 
errors. However, as a non-confident firm faces a fixed cost 
 to perfectly predict the 
aggregate price level, it suffers a loss given by: 

(5) 

 

. 

 
Meanwhile,  a  confident  firm  is  subject  to  a  quadratic  loss  by  using  the  official 
aggregate price level target to predict the optimal individual price. Using (1), (2) and (4), 
the loss of a confident firm can be expressed as follows: 

(6) 

 

where 

. 

, 

By  taking  (5)  and  (6)  as  the  expected  payoffs  of  the  existing  foresight  strategies, 

 
we obtain the following replicator dynamic: 2 

(7) 

 

. 

The intuition  underlying the  above  expression is  the following.  In  every  revision period, 
each  firm  with  probability  one  (for  simplicity)  learns  the  payoff  to  another  randomly 
chosen  other  firm  and  changes  to  the  other’s  foresight  strategy  if  it  perceives  that  the 
other’s payoff is higher. As the expression between brackets in (7) is the difference given 
by 
,  the  proportion  of  confident  firms  increases  (decreases)  if  the  module  of  the 

expected  loss  of  confident  firms  is  smaller  (larger)  than  the  cost  to  perfectly  predict  the 
aggregate  price  level.  Under  the  replicator  dynamic  (7),  to  put  it  alternatively,  the 
frequency of a foresight strategy increases exactly when it has above-average payoff. 

Moreover, we assume that the evolutionary dynamics (7) operates in the presence 
of  disturbances  analogous  to  mutations  in  natural  environments.  In  a  biological  setting, 
mutation  is  interpreted  literally,  consisting  of  random  changes  in  genetic  codes.  In 
economic  settings,  as  pointed  out  by  Samuelson  (1997,  ch.  7),  mutation  refers  to  a 
situation  in  which  a  player  refrains  from  comparing  payoffs  and  changes  strategy  at 
random.  Hence  the  present  model  features  mutation  as  an  exogenous  disturbance  in  the 
evolutionary selection mechanism (7) leading some firms to choose a foresight strategy at 
random.  This  disturbance  component  is  intended  to  capture  the  effect,  for  instance,  of 

                                                 
2 The replicator dynamic can be derived from a model of (social or individual) learning as in Weibull (1995, 
sec. 4.4).

or  other  changes  in  the  policy-making  framework  (which  nonetheless  do  not  involve  an 
abandonment of the price level targeting regime).3 A question that then arises is whether 
the  occurrence  of  such  an  exogenous  disturbance  (or  noise)  precludes  the  continuous 
reaching  of  the  price  level  target.  As  shown  shortly,  the  answer  is  no.  Yet  the  long-run 
equilibrium  distribution  of  foresight  strategies  does  depend  on  whether  the  evolutionary 
dynamics is so perturbed. 

Drawing  on  Gale,  Binmore  and  Samuelson  (1995),  mutation  can  be  incorporated 
 be the number (measure) of 

into the selection mechanism (7) as follows. Let 

mutant  firms  that choose a foresight  strategy  in  a given revision period  independently of 
the  related  payoffs.  Therefore,  there  are 
  non-confident 

  confident  firms  and 

firms  acting  as  mutants.  We  assume  that  mutant  firms  choose  one  of  the  two  foresight 

strategies  with  the  same  probability,  so  that  there  are 

  confident  mutant  firms  and 

 non-confident mutant  firms  changing strategies.  The net  flow  of mutant firms 

becoming  confident  firms  in  a  given  revision  period,  which  can  be  either  positive  or 
negative, is the following: 

(8) 

 

. 

This noise can be incorporated to the evolutionary selection mechanism (7) to yield 

 
the following noisy (perturbed) replicator dynamic: 

(9) 

 

. 

Therefore, for given values of 

 and m, the state transition of the economy is determined 

by the dynamic system (9), whose state space is 

. 

3. Best-reply monetary policy and equilibrium distribution of foresight strategies 

 

The  monetary  authority  is  assumed  to  aim  to  minimize 

,  where 

  is  the  terminal  planning  time  and 

  is  a  constant  and  exogenously  given 
intertemporal  discount  rate.  Using  (4),  the  monetary  authority’s  objective  functional  can 
be expressed as: 

(10) 

 

. 

                                                 
3 Now as in Kandori, Mailath  and Rob (1993),  two other rationale for such a random choice is that  a firm 
exits the market with some (fixed) probability and is replaced with a new firm which knows nothing about 
the game, or that each firm “experiments” every once in a while with exogenously fixed probability.

Therefore, the best-reply monetary policy is derived as the path of control variable 
m that minimizes the objective functional (10) subject to the noisy replicator dynamic (9), 

given the initial proportion of confident firms, denoted by

not be satisfied.

the inequalities in  (13) become  equalities for all

Given (15), the control-variable path (14) satisfies the necessary condition (12). 

Indeed, the control-variable path (14) minimizes (11) given that:

The path of the costate variable, given by (15), satisfies the transversality condition 
 
for an optimal control problem with finite-horizon planning and free terminal state, given 

by

satisfied  as  well.  And  the  other  corresponding  transversality  condition  given  by

Conclusions 

 

The  best-reply  monetary  policy  is  to  set 

  at  each  moment  of  the  planning 

horizon,  which  ensures 

  all  along.  Therefore,  we  can  interpret  the  best-reply 

policy-making in two alternative ways, according to which variable is assigned the role of 
policy  instrument  (or  control  variable).  First,  for  an  exogenously  given  aggregate  price 

level  target,  the  best-reply  monetary  policy  is  to  set 

  throughout.  Second,  for  an 

exogenously given nominal money supply, the best-reply policy-making is to set 

 

all along. 

When the evolutionary dynamics governing the distribution of foresight strategies 
in  the  population  of  price  setters  is  subject  to  exogenous  perturbations,  the  unique 

equilibrium  point 

  is  asymptotically  stable.  Although  confidence  is  never 

fully  conquered,  the  price  level  target  is  nonetheless  continuously  reached.  Meanwhile, 
absent  perturbations,  which  is  equivalent  to  setting 
,  the  equation  of  motion  (18) 

yields  two  equilibrium  points, 

  and 

.  As  the  graph  of  the  function 

under 

  is  a  concave-down  parabola,  it  follows  that  the  equilibrium  point 

 

  is 

unstable, while the equilibrium point 
 is asymptotically stable. Therefore, when the 
evolutionary selection dynamics is not perturbed by mutations, the continuous reaching of 
the  price  level  target  does  ensure  that  complete  confidence  (or  full  credibility)  is 
eventually conquered. Paraphrasing how Samuelson (1997, p. 3) describes an equilibrium 
emerging from rule-of-thumb behavior through an evolutionary dynamics:4 an equilibrium 
solution  with  the  aggregate  price  level  target  being  reached  does  not  appear  because  all 
price setters are fully confident, but rather price setters eventually become fully confident 
because  a  best-reply  monetary  policy  ensuring  the  reach  of  that  target  as  an  equilibrium 
solution has been followed for long enough. Though derived in a specific macroeconomic 
setting, this analytical result has broader implications for the design of monetary policy in 
pursuit of price stability. One such implication is that setting a price target matters more as 
a way to provide monetary policy with a sharper focus on price stability than as a device to 
conquer credibility. As regards the conquering of credibility, it turns out that actions speak 
louder than words, and the achievement of price stability is what ultimately matters most 
as a confidence-building device.
