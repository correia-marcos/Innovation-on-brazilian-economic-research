Resumo 

O fenômeno da urbanização continua ocorrendo de maneira bastante intensa, especialmente em 
países em desenvolvimento, tornando necessária a compreensão do que faz as cidades terem tanto 
sucesso  como  centros  produtivos.  Nesse  contexto,  o  tema  das  economias  de  aglomeração  no 
mercado de trabalho tem sido explorado de maneira significativa no período recente em função do 
grande  interesse  em  explorar  novas  bases  de  dados  longitudinais  e  de  propor  políticas  para  o 
tamanho  ótimo  de  cidades.  A  maioria  dos  estudos  procura  avaliar  os  ganhos  estáticos  da 
aglomeração, mas uma corrente mais recente da literatura tem buscado entender em que medida a 
aglomeração  proporciona  ganhos  dinâmicos  de  produtividade  (afetando  o  crescimento  dos 
salários).  Desse  modo,  utilizando  dados  da  RAISMIGRA  de  1995  a  2008,  este  estudo  busca 
mensurar não apenas as externalidades estáticas como também  as externalidades dinâmicas das 
aglomerações, procurando entender em que medida o movimento migratório dos indivíduos afeta 
os seus ganhos salariais futuros. Assim, calcula-se o impacto da experiência adquirida nos anos 
anteriores em diferentes tamanhos de cidade no salário atual, observando que o maior número de 
anos trabalhados em cidades mais densas resulta em maiores ganhos salariais.

Abstract 

The  urbanization  phenomenon  is  still  going  on,  especially  in  developing  countries,  raising  the 
question  of  why  are  cities  this  successful  as  productive  centers.  In  this  context,  agglomeration 
economies in labor market outcomes have been explored significantly in the past years, even more 
because longitudinal individual micro-data were made available only recently in many countries. 
Most studies try to measure static agglomeration externalities, but more recently, there has been 
an  increasing  interest  in  dynamic  agglomeration  gains  (which  affect  wage  growth).  Here  we 
consider data for the Brazilian formal labor market from 1995 to 2008 (RAISMIGRA), trying to 
measure not only static agglomeration externalities, but also dynamic ones. In this sense, we try to 
understand how migratory movements affect the future wage level of individuals. We calculate 
the impact of acquired experience in different city sizes over the observed wage, finding that if 
individuals work more years in bigger cities, they will have higher wages in the future.

1.  Introduction 

Cities  are  more  important  than  ever  for  economic  growth  and  life  in  society.  People  living, 
working, and thinking together in dense areas is a sign of the success of cities (Glaeser, 2011). If 
in the United States 80.7% of the population live in 3.06% of the territory (Glaeser, 2008, and US 
Census Bureau1), in Brazil this spatial concentration is even higher (84.4% of the population was 
living in 1.07% of the territory in 20102). In the United States, Glaeser and Maré (2001) find that 
in  metropolitan  areas  workers  earn  25%  more  than  their  non-urban  counterparts  do.  In  this 
perspective, increasing urbanization is interpreted as a sign of gains from agglomeration (net from 
costs).  

In fact, the urban economics literature provides strong evidence of the existence of an urban wage 
premium. This sort of analysis can be found for example in Combes et al. (2008a), Glaeser and 
Maré (2001), Melo and Graham (2009), Mion and Naticchioni (2009), Ciccone and Hall (1996), 
Combes et al. (2010), Groot et al. (2014a), and Groot and de Groot (2014b). A literature review 
can be found in  Puga (2010) and Rosenthal and  Strange  (2004).  The urban wage premium  can 
range  from  1%  to  11%  depending  on  the  sample  and  the  country  considered.  This  widespread 
effort is pushed by the fact that longitudinal individual-level microdata on the labor market has 
been recently made available in many different countries.  

The  studies  aforementioned  aim  to  measure  the  static  effect  of  agglomeration  economies  on 
productivity  on  the  regional  level.  Combes  et  al.  (2008a)  summarize  the  three  main  sources  of 
regional wage disparities: (i) the composition of the local labor market; (ii) the availability of local 
non-human endowments that can increase productivity; and (iii) agglomeration economies. The 
third  item  is  related  to  wage  differences  that  follow  from  close  proximity  between  firms  and 
workers/consumers, thick labor markets and knowledge spillovers (Duranton and Puga, 2004).  

In  general,  this  type  of  work  involves  regressing  nominal  wages  at  the  individual  level  (as  a 
productivity outcome) on a measure of agglomeration at the local level (Duranton, 2014a). Wages 
are supposed to equalize the marginal productivity of labor under perfect competition, and in the 
case there is  some market  imperfection, they are supposed to  be higher in  places that are more 
productive. As pointed out by Duranton (2014b), wages should be in nominal instead of in real 
terms, because the former are more related to productivity differentials, while the latter represent 
life standard levels. 

In  addition  to  their  static  and  instantaneous  effect,  agglomeration  economies  can  have  a  long-
lasting dynamic impact on productivity. There is no clear answer on the best strategy to follow to 
analyze  dynamic  externalities  and  separate  them  from  static  ones,  due  to  limitations  on  data 
availability. De La Roca and Puga (2014) provide one of the most complete studies in this area, 
but relevant efforts were also made by Yankow (2006), Wheeler (2006), D’Costa and Overman 
(2014), Carlsen et al. (2013), and Gordon (2015), among others. 

There are only a few studies on agglomeration economies in Brazil, mostly based on the regional 
level or individual cross-sections (Simões and Freitas, 2014; Maciente, 2013; Fontes et al., 2010; 
Freguglia and Menezes-Filho, 2012; Silva and Silveira-Neto, 2009). According to the knowledge

of the authors, so far there is no study covering dynamic agglomeration economies in the Brazilian 
context (or for an emerging economy). 

Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap in the empirical research in Brazil, as well as to contribute 
to the methodological discussion of the literature. The first set of results covers the evaluation of 
static agglomeration economies using a large longitudinal database (covering the period from 1995 
to 2008). In the second set of regression models, a first attempt of estimation of dynamic effects is 
provided, considering the effect of previous experience in different city sizes over wages.  

The next sections are organised as follows: Section 2 contains a brief discussion of the conceptual 
differences  between  static  and  dynamic  externalities;  Section  3  discusses  the  methodological 
approach; Section 4 discusses the main studies on dynamic agglomeration economies; and then, 
Section 5 presents the data; Section 6 brings the results; and, finally, Section 7 draws the main 
conclusions from the analysis. 

 

2.  Static versus dynamic externalities 

Static effects are based on the assumption that agglomeration economies have a once-and-for-all 
effect on productivity, with no further impact in the following periods. On the other hand, dynamic 
externalities  aim  to  measure  a  long-lasting  effect  or  a  permanent  impact  of  city  size  or  urban 
density  on  productivity  (Combes  and  Gobillon,  2015).  Another  way  of  distinguishing  these 
concepts is the following: static productivity advantages refer to a higher productivity found in 
large cities when compared to smaller ones, while dynamic productivity advantages are associated 
to the fact that productivity can increase differently over time for each city size (Camagni et al., 
2015). 

Among the possible permanent  impacts  of agglomeration economies, local  productivity  growth 
can increase with technological spillovers, or individuals can learn more and faster in bigger cities 
(Lucas, 1988). In this perspective, individuals can learn by working in bigger cities (De La Roca 
and Puga, 2014). Glaeser (1999) defends that the rate of interaction between people is accelerated 
by urban density, leading to an increase in human capital accumulation due to human interactions. 
This effect is particularly high for highly skilled people, usually more concentrated in big cities. 
Yankow (2006) points out that this learning hypothesis requires some time in the city, meaning 
that there is no expectation of immediate wage gains when moving to a bigger urban concentration 
or any wage loss when workers leave cities. 

 

3.  Methodological approach 

The literature on agglomeration economies largely explores the model developed within the Urban 
Economics framework, which aims to represent the relationship between local characteristics and 
productivity  (nominal  wage).  The  main  assumption  here  is  that  worker’s  location  choices  are 
strictly exogenous, meaning that they do not take into account wage shocks due to localized job 
opportunities in their migration or job change decisions. Another possible strategy is to introduce 
static and dynamic agglomeration effects in a dynamic model of location choices (Baum-Snow 
and  Pavan,  2012),  but  this  sort  of  estimation  requires  a  structural  model  behind  it  in  order  to 
achieve identification. 

The  following  model  can  represent  the  static  agglomeration  approach,  inspired  in  the  Abdel-
Rahman  and  Fujita  (1990)  tradition.  A  production  function  of  a  price-taking  representative  firm  in 
region 𝑟 and time 𝑡, using 𝑙𝑟,𝑡 of labor and an amount 𝑘𝑟,𝑡 of other inputs is given by (Combes et  al., 
2008b): 

 

𝑦𝑟,𝑡 = 𝐴𝑟,𝑡(𝑠𝑟,𝑡𝑙𝑟,𝑡)

𝜇

1−𝜇
𝑘𝑟,𝑡

 

(1) 

In this case, 𝐴𝑟,𝑡 is the technology factor (Hicks-neutral), 𝜇 is the share of labor in the productive process 
and 𝑠𝑟,𝑡 is the efficiency level of workers. Moreover, 𝑤𝑟,𝑡 is the wage level and 𝑟𝑟,𝑡 is the price of other 
inputs. Then, the profit of the firm in region r is: 

 

𝜋𝑟,𝑡 = 𝑝𝑟,𝑡𝑦𝑟,𝑡 −   𝑤𝑟,𝑡 𝑙𝑟,𝑡 −𝑟𝑟,𝑡 𝑘𝑟,𝑡 

(2) 

In a competitive equilibrium, the first-order conditions for the optimal input mix generates a wage equation: 

 

𝑤𝑟,𝑡 = 𝜇(1 − 𝜇)(1−𝜇) 𝜇⁄ (

1
𝜇⁄

𝑝𝑟,𝑡𝐴𝑟,𝑡
1−𝜇 )
𝑟𝑟,𝑡

𝑠𝑟,𝑡 ≡ 𝐵𝑟,𝑡𝑠𝑟,𝑡 

 

(3) 

Here, 𝐵𝑟,𝑡 represents the composite local  productivity  effect. This  effect  can  be decomposed in 
pecuniary  externalities,  which  appear  through  local  markets  (𝑝𝑗  and 𝑟𝑗  capture  agglomeration  and 
dispersion forces respectively), and pure local externalities (do not appear through a market mechanism, 𝐴𝑗 
is  related  to  technological  externalities  –  knowledge  and  learning  spillovers,  workers  and  firms  sharing 
indivisible goods, among others)3. Due to the great difficulty in estimating these effects separately, most 
studies in the literature quantify the overall local effect (Combes and Gobillon, 2015). Furthermore, the 
potential inclusion of measures of cost of living in the model to explain real wage inequalities between 
cities  will  be  related  to  a  completely  different  question,  while  the  relation  of  local  characteristics  and 
nominal wages is enough to capture the net effect of agglomeration on productivity. 

The  component  of  local  labor  skills  (𝑠𝑟,𝑡)  should  be  included  because  higher  skills  may  be 
overrepresented  in  larger  cities  (due  to  other  factors  than  the  city  size  itself,  such  as  local 
amenities),  meaning  that  its  omission  may  overstate  the  impact  of  agglomeration  economies 
(composition  effect).  On  the  other  hand,  people  can  also  become  more  skilled  in  bigger  cities 
(through a learning process, externality due to proximity to more skilled people), meaning that the 
inclusion of a local skill variable can capture part of the agglomeration effect. Combining these 
two elements, it is important to include skills, but not at the local level, and individual skills can 
do the job, by avoiding measuring this agglomeration effect. Therefore, equation 3 becomes: 

 

𝑤𝑖,𝑡 = 𝐵𝑟,𝑡𝑠𝑖,𝑡 

(4) 

In this case, information at the individual level is required (individuals that work in region 𝑟), available 
only recently in some countries. This approach is based on the assumption that agglomeration economies 
embedded in 𝐵𝑟,𝑡 have a once-and-for-all impact on productivity. However, as mentioned in the previous 
section, agglomeration economies can have a long-lasting or even permanent effect. Potential sources of 
dynamic gains can be identified in all components of 𝐵𝑟,𝑡, but as in the static case, it is only possible to 
measure the overall impact of dynamic externalities (Combes and Gobillon, 2015).  

The inclusion of dynamic effects on the aforementioned model is done by firstly simplifying equation 4 to 
consider  a  static-local-effects-only  model  for  a  local  outcome,  𝑦𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑢𝑖 + 𝛽𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖,𝑡.  Then,  the 
individual  productivity  growth  is  written  as  𝑦𝑖,𝑡 − 𝑦𝑖,𝑡−1 = 𝛽𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡 − 𝛽𝑟(𝑖,𝑡−1),𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡.  The 

                                                           
3 Scitovsky (1954). 

inclusion of dynamic fixed effects is done by considering in this regression a fixed effect for region 
𝑟 in 𝑡 (region 𝑟 in 𝑡 − 1 has an impact on productivity growth between 𝑡 − 1 and  𝑡, for 𝑡 ≥ 1): 4 

 

𝑦𝑖,𝑡 − 𝑦𝑖,𝑡−1 = 𝛽𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡 − 𝛽𝑟(𝑖,𝑡−1),𝑡−1 + 𝜇𝑟(𝑖,𝑡−1),𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 

Equation 5 can be transformed to obtain: 

 

𝑡

𝑦𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑦𝑖,0 = 𝛽𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡 + ∑ 𝜇𝑟(𝑖,𝑡−𝑘),𝑡−𝑘

+ 𝜁𝑖,𝑡 

𝑘=1

(5) 

(6) 

This transformation shows that even when dynamic effects affect only the growth rate of the local 
outcome (𝑦𝑖,𝑡 − 𝑦𝑖,𝑡−1 in equation 5), they do have a permanent effect on its level. There are a few 
assumptions underlying the relationship considered in equation 5, namely the fact that dynamic 
effects are perfectly transferable over time, and that this specification makes more sense for stayers 
than movers. In the case of movers, it is relevant to consider not only the region of origin (in 𝑡 −
1), but also the region of destination (in  𝑡). Then, for movers it is more appropriate to re-write 
equation 6 in the following way: 

 

𝑡

𝑦𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑦𝑖,0 = 𝛽𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡 + ∑ 𝜇𝑟(𝑖,𝑡−𝑘),𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡−𝑘

+ 𝜁𝑖,𝑡 

(7) 

𝑘=1

The problem with this formulation is that the number of parameters for dynamic effects becomes 
very large (𝑅2. 𝑇, where 𝑅 is the number of regions and 𝑇 the number of time spams in the panel), 
and the identification of the model requires the imposition of restrictions on the parameters. This 
last aspect can be seen in the case of a re-written version of equation 5, for stayers: 

 

𝑦𝑖,𝑡 − 𝑦𝑖,𝑡−1 = 𝛽𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡 − 𝛽𝑟(𝑖,𝑡−1),𝑡−1 + 𝜇𝑟(𝑖,𝑡−1),𝑟(𝑖,𝑡)𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 

(8) 

In which the variation of static and the level of dynamic effects cannot be estimated separately 
(and  the  same  happens  in  the  movers’  case).  The  next  section  will  present  a  description  of  the 
different  strategies  used  in  the  literature  so  far,  and  it  will  be  followed  by  a  discussion  of  the 
empirical strategy applied here. 

 

4. Strategies of estimation of dynamic agglomeration economies 

There are only a few studies dealing with dynamic agglomeration economies and including all the 
issues discussed in the literature of static gains. In this section some of these studies are discussed, 
with their advantages and disadvantages.  

One of the most complete empirical studies in dynamic agglomeration economies is done by De 
la Roca and Puga (2014). Their main goal is to separate the possible reasons why firms would pay 
higher salaries in bigger cities: (i) static advantages; (ii) sorting of more productive workers; (iii) 
dynamic  advantages  (cities  facilitate  learning  and  experimentation).  Therefore,  they  estimate  a 
mincerian wage equation including individual fixed effects to capture the sorting process, and the 
number of years of experience each individual has of working in different city sizes. They estimate 
this model to a very large Spanish panel data set  (they follow workers from 1981 to 2009, and 
evaluate their wages from 2004 to 2009). Two restrictions applied to the model discussed in the 

                                                           
4 These steps are discussed by Combes and Gobillon (2015). 

previous sections are that the authors consider only a few groups of city sizes (instead of allowing 
a continuous range of city sizes) and that individual heterogeneity is equal in the dynamic and the 
static effects.  

With a different strategy, D’Costa and Overman (2014) use a large panel (1998-2008) for British 
workers aiming to evaluate whether the sorting of high ability workers can explain urban wage 
premiums  and if this wage premium  is  given to the workers immediately  or over time through 
faster wage growth. Their conclusion is that both learning and sorting matter for understanding the 
effects of cities on wage growth. The main restriction imposed in the model discussed above is 
that even if they estimate the specification in first differences, allowing for a distinct heterogeneous 
effect in the static and the dynamic cases, they have to exclude movers from the analysis (therefore, 
this study does not measure between-city dynamic effects). 

A few years earlier, Wheeler (2006) estimated the impact of density on annual wage growth, also 
calculating the within-job and between-job components of this growth, with data for young male 
workers in the United States. Their main finding is that there is a positive relationship between 
wage growth and city size, but when they control for individual fixed effects there is no evidence 
of this urban wage premium on growth.  

Yankow (2006) also regress the wage growth against changes in the location of work, separating 
the mobility effect from the growth effect. Their conclusions for United States male young workers 
is that when they move into cities, they have a significant wage growth (6 percentage points) in 
comparison to the individuals that stayed in a rural area (with a symmetric effect for out-of-the-
city  migrants).  The  main  drawback  in  their  strategy  is  that  they  cannot  control  for  sorting  on 
unobservables, a limitation that D’Costa and Overman (2014) try to overcome. 

 

5.  Empirical strategy 

Equation 4 discussed in section 3 can be estimated in the following way: 

 

𝑦𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜇𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖,𝑡𝜃 + 𝑍𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡𝛾 + 𝜂𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 

(9) 

In which 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 represents the logarithm of the hourly wage  and 𝑍𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑖 contains the logarithm of 
employment  density.  Most  empirical  studies  consider  employment  instead  of  population  as  a 
measure of the agglomeration because it is as better measure of local economic activity and it is 
easily available for many  years (Combes and Gobillon, 2015). Ciccone and Hall (1996) defend 
that density should be included instead of total  employment  in  this regression, because it deals 
better  with  the  heterogeneity  of  the  spatial  extent  of  the  geographical  units  considered.  The 
estimated parameter for density will be an elasticity, whose meaning is easily understood. 

Following the discussion widely explored in Combes et al. (2008a, 2010 and 2011) and De la Roca 
and  Puga  (2014),  in  order  to  avoid  potential  endogeneity  in  the  estimation  of  equation  9,  it  is 
important  to  control  for  individuals  unobserved  heterogeneity  (fixed  effects)  to  deal  with  the 
sorting process (endogenous quality of labor). Moreover, there is a high risk of endogeneity of the 
density  measure  (endogenous  quantity  of  labor),  what  requires  an  instrumental  variables 
estimation. Following the argument defended by Groot et al. (2014a) that fixed effects create a 
black box in the explanation of urban wage differentials, the estimations presented here will also 
allow for a POLS strategy. 

Then, proceeding to the estimation of a dynamic model, an equation inspired in the work of De la 
Roca and Puga (2014) is considered: 

 

𝑅

𝑦𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜇𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖,𝑡𝜃 + 𝑍𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡𝛾 + 𝜂𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡 + ∑ 𝛿𝑗,𝑟𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖,𝑗,𝑡

+ 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 

(10) 

𝑗=1

Here, once again 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 is the outcome variable, 𝜇𝑖 is the individual fixed effect,  𝑋𝑖,𝑡 is the set of 
time-varying  individual  characteristics,  𝑍𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡  contains  employment  density  of  region  𝑟  in  𝑡, 
𝜂𝑐(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡 represents a region fixed effect, 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖,𝑗,𝑡 is the experience acquired by worker 𝑖 in region 
𝑗 up until time 𝑡 and 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 is the error term. 
In order to reduce computational complexity5, all these estimations will be conducted in one stage 
only (usually in the literature there is an effort to run a two-stage regression with the second stage 
being the regression of the spatial wage residual against local characteristics – Groot et al., 2014a; 
Combes  et  al.,  2008a;  among  others).  One  additional  aspect  is  that  𝜂𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡  will  be  replaced  by 
macro-regions dummies, and 𝑍𝑟(𝑖,𝑡),𝑡 may contain either the logarithm of density or a categorical 
variable  grouping  REGIC  areas  in  four  groups,  defined  by  the  quartiles  of  density  for  all 
individuals. 

 

6.  Data 

The  main  database  considered  here  is  RAISMIGRA  (Annual  Report  of  Social  Information  - 
Migration, from the Ministry of Labour), which consists of identified registration data of all formal 
firms and their employees in the Brazilian labor market, focusing on the characteristics of the work 
contract.  This  database  provides  longitudinal  data  for  all  formally  employed  individuals  in  the 
private sector (or part of the public sector, depending on the type of contract), with a significant 
regional disaggregation (municipal level), from 1995 to 2008. 

One of the main advantages of this database is that it is a mandatory report, covering the entire 
formal sector. Because of this, differently from individual self-reporting surveys, there is a smaller 
risk of wage under-reporting. Nonetheless, the fact that it only covers the formal sector presents a 
potential  drawback  in  the  analysis,  as  the  informal  sector  in  Brazil  is  very  relevant  (RAIS 
represents  less  than  30%  of  the  workforce  in  the  initial  years  of  the  period  analyzed,  reaching 
around 35% in 2008. Moreover, the reporting process is supposed to be more accurate in the case 
of bigger firms, which are usually located in larger cities. 

The regional unit of analysis is the REGIC area6, which is a better measure of a labor market area. 
In  fact,  this  level  of  analysis  is  more  suitable  for  the  empirical  analysis  of  agglomeration 
economies, as the estimation will not be affected by daily commuting (that is very different from 

                                                           
5 This estimation in two stages would mean to include 14*482 dummies  in the first stage for REGIC area and year 
combinations, apart from individual fixed effects. 
6 REGIC areas (482) aggregate municipalities based on their interaction, mostly associated to daily commuting flows, 
transportation  links  and  interconnectedness  in  general  terms  (IBGE,  2013).  From  1995  to  2008  some  new 
municipalities appeared, requiring an adaptation of the original REGIC areas to encompass these new municipalities 
according to the municipalities they were originated from. The authors can provide details of this aggregation process. 

moving permanently to another area to look for another job). A few steps were conducted7 in order 
to achieve a database representing the dynamics of a competitive labor market, in manufacture and 
service sectors. Only individuals observed in all years (from 1995 to 2008, and separately from 
1995  to  2002  and  2003  to  2008)  Finally,  due  to  limitations  on  computer  processing,  it  was 
necessary to select a 10% sample8 for each database.  

There are other data-sources considered in this study.  For instance, skills are obtained from the 
original  study  of  Maciente  (2012),  who  converted  the  ONET  classification  to  the  Brazilian 
occupational  classification  (of  2002).  However,  the  RAISMIGRA  database  contained  two 
different  occupational  classifications  along  the  whole  period  (from  1995  to  2002,  the  available 
classification is the occupational structure of 1994, while the period from 2003 to 2008 has the 
occupational structure of 2002). Moreover, Maciente’s study considers occupations disaggregated 
at the five-digit level. As the RAISMIGRA database allows a three-digit disaggregation only, skills 
classified  at  the  five-digit  classification  were  aggregated  through  a  simple  average  (and  a 
conversion to the 1994 classification was applied for the 1995-2002 period). Therefore, as there 
are some methodological differences in the construction of the data from 1995 to 2002 and 2003 
to 2008, whenever skills are considered, it is not possible to analyze the whole time period at once 
(1995-2008). In order to do this more comprehensive analysis, educational level dummies were 
included. 

Finally,  instruments  related  to  colonial  economic  activities  and  geographic  characteristics  were 
provided by Naritomi et al. (2012) and aggregated to the REGIC area level. Population density in 
1940 was obtained at the IPEADATA website. Further details are presented in Table A1 in annex. 

A first analysis based on aggregated data indicates that there is a positive relationship between the 
logarithm of wages and the logarithm of local density (0.52). However, it is necessary to evaluate 
this correlation net of other confounding factors. 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                           
7 There was an initial selection of active contracts in December of each year for male individuals working for private 
companies  in  permanent  jobs.    Then,  contracts  with  wages  equal  to  zero,  or  with  less  than  20  weekly  hours  were 
excluded, as well as contracts with missing information on educational level and occupation. The next step conducted 
was the selection of individuals aged 18 to 36 years in 1995 (for databases starting in 1995) and 18 to 36 in 2003 (for 
databases  starting  in  2003).  Finally,  only  individuals  working  in  manufacture  and  service  sectors  were  kept  in  the 
database (sectors 15 to 36, 55 to 74 and 76 to 99, at the 2 digits-CNAE 1.0 classification). 
8 These samples are representative for the following characteristics in the initial year of each database: age group (less 
than  25  years  old,  25  to  29  years  old,  30  to  36);  employment  level  in  the  REGIC  area  (less  than  50  thousand,  50 
thousand to less than 100 thousand, 100 thousand to less than 500 thousand, 500 thousand to 1 million, 1 million or 
more); firm size (up to 4 employees, 5 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 49, 50 to 99, 100 to 249, 250 to 499, 500 to 999, 1,000 
employees or more); macro-region; educational level (illiterate, incomplete primary school, complete primary school 
to incomplete high school, complete high school to incomplete college, college degree or more); and sector (CNAE 
1.0 at the 2 digits level).

The  main  descriptive  statistics  are  presented  in  Table  1  and  show  that  there  is  a  higher 
concentration of workers in manufacture sectors, in the age group from 30 to 36 years old in 1995. 
Furthermore, higher percentages of workers are found in firms with 250 or more employees, in the 
Southeast region of the country (North and Center-West are underrepresented, as a sign of their 
higher concentration in extractive activities and agriculture). In terms of educational attainment, 
there is a high concentration of workers with incomplete middle school or with incomplete college 
level. Finally, comparing wages in 1995 and 2008 (deflated by INPC-IBGE), they seem almost 
stable.  However,  density  of  employment  seems  to  have  increased  in  the  period.  Some  of  these 
characteristics of the database are due to the small size of the sample (only 10% of the original 
database comprising workers observed in the whole period).  

 

7.  Results 

As mentioned in Section 4, the first set of results explore static agglomeration economies in Brazil. 
In  order  to  provide  a  robust  result,  eight  different  specifications  were  estimated,  with  different 
compositions  of  controls  and  estimation  methods.  Comparing  Models  1  and  2  of  Table  1,  it  is 
possible to note that there is a positive partial correlation between density and wages, around 0.08, 
and when individual fixed effects are taken into account, this correlation drops to 0.01. This is an 
indication that the sorting process is very relevant to determine the wage level in Brazil. Another 
important consequence is that the effect measure by movers (which is calculated when individual 
fixed effects are included) is much lower than the one measured with the whole database.

The second potential endogeneity issue is dealt with the inclusion of instruments for employment 
density (ln(population  density in  1940), sugar cane, gold  and coffee exploration in  the colonial 
period, geographical characteristics). As Models 3 and 4 show, there is a slight change in the size 
of the estimated coefficient for density, but the main conclusion still hold.  

Due to the restrictions in the skills variables discussed in the previous section, it is not possible to 
estimate a model including them for the whole period. Therefore, Models 5 to 8 divide the database 
in two, from 1995 to 2002 and from 2003 to 2008. In all these models, the estimation is already 
including individual fixed effects and instrumental variables. The comparison of Models 5 and 6, 
and 7 and 8, shows that controlling for skills or for education attainment generates very similar 
results. Finally, it is also possible to see that the density elasticity for the second time period is 
much smaller than the one for the first time period. A possible explanation for this result is that 
there was a concentration of workers in bigger cities over the years, increasing the competition for

Another potential reason is that Brazil saw a significant formalization process 
during that decade, and that can be affecting the results over the years.

Table  3  brings  very  similar  specifications  to  Table  2.  The  only  difference  is  that  instead  of 
considering density as a running variable, four categories of dummies are included. Apart from the 
fact that the main conclusions discussed above hold, it is possible to note that people working in 
REGIC  areas  of  the  upper  quartile  will  have  higher  salaries.  Therefore,  it  seems  that  the 
relationship between wages and density is not linear.

economies  for  the  Brazilian  labor  market.  Analyzing  Model  1,  it  is  noticeable  that  previous 
experience  is  not  significant,  while  static  gains  are  significant.  When  interactions  between 
experience and the quartile of density at the present location are included, some of them become 
significant, but with non-intuitive signs.

Model 4, the 
preferred composition, shows that almost all static effects loose their significance, except for the 
higher quartile, whose coefficient is positive. Therefore, only individuals working in denser cities 
will  get  a  significant  advantage  from  that.  Experience  in  different  types  of  groups  of  cities  is 
negative and significant for quartiles 3 and 4.  

A result that is more interesting is that individuals who have experience in cities from quartile 2 
working in any city size have a lower wage level nowadays, and individuals with experience in 
cities of quartile 4 working in cities of quartile 3 have a positive and significant gain from that.  

This type of analysis presents many possibilities which still have to be explored in future studies. 

8.  Conclusion 

 

The  main  conclusions  from  the  analysis  presented  above  are  that  there  is  a  positive  partial 
correlation between density and wages, around 0.08, and when individual fixed effects are taken 
into account, this correlation drops to 0.01. This is an indication that the sorting process is very 
relevant to determine the wage level in Brazil. However, it seems that the relationship between 
wages and density is not linear. 

Considering  dynamic  and  static  externalities,  when  they  are  estimated  simultaneously  and 
individual  heterogeneity  is  taken  into  account,  there  is  indication  that  static  effects  loose 
importance  (but  are  still  relevant  for  individuals  working  in  the  group  of  denser  cities). 
Furthermore, when experience is combined with the present location, there is a positive gain only 
for workers in cities with medium density, that had worked in high density cities. 

Future studies should consider other estimation strategies to try to assess the relative importance 
of static and dynamic agglomeration externalities. There is still a long road to go.
