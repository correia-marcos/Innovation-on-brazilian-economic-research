Abstract: The extensive empirical effort made  in the neo-Kaleckian literature to estimate whether 
economic growth is wage or profit led has raised important criticisms about the identification strategy 
used  in  the  empirical  models.  This  paper  estimates  a  panel  data  model  in  which  country-specific 
structural characteristics and possible endogenous relationships in the net exports rate and investment 
function are explicitly take into account. The paper attempts to respect key tenets of the neo-Kaleckian 
investment function. Hence, the identification strategy is based on several  estimates of the stock of 
capital and the rate of capacity utilization for  some developed and developing countries. The main 
results suggest that the growth regime was wage led in developed countries, while most developing 
countries exhibited a profit-led growth regime.  Interestingly, however, while the  profit-led regime 
occurs  through  the  international  trade  channel  in  Latin  American  developing  countries,  in  other 
developing countries, the causality channel is mainly related to the domestic investment function.

1 Introduction 

One  of  the  main  interesting  contributions  of  the  neo-Kaleckian  model  of  growth  and 

distribution is the theoretical possibility that economic growth may be guided by the distribution of 

income in favor of wages (workers) or profits (capitalists), the so-called wage- and profit-led growth 

regimes.2 There is a significant branch of the empirical literature seeking to empirically test such a 

possibility. 

Considering the type of identification strategy used in the literature, Blecker (2016) separated 

most of the empirical effort into two groups: the aggregative and structural approaches. The structural 

approach  estimates  each  individual  component  of  aggregate  demand  function  separately  and  then 

adds  the  effects  together  to  determine  the  liquid  effect.  The  aggregative  approach  relies  on  the 

estimation of a reduced form of the aggregate demand function, calculating the regime by computing 

the partial effects of wage share on output.  

Based on a structural approach, Hein and Vogel (2007) estimated this relationship between 

functional income distribution and economic growth in six developed countries from 1960 until 2005: 

Austria, France, Germany, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the USA. They found mixed results 

over the period:  France, Germany, the UK, and the USA  were wage led, whereas  Austria and the 

Netherlands were profit led. In an expanded version of the model, which explicitly  considered the 

role of productivity growth, Hein and Torassow (2009) showed that in countries in which the growth 

is wage led, an income redistribution to profits not only weakens aggregate demand and GDP growth 

but, through the Verdoorn effect, also negatively affects productivity growth. 

Using a similar structural approach, Stockhammer and Wildauer (2015) reported panel data 

evidence showing that the domestic demand in 18 OECD countries was wage led. The authors used 

an empirical model controlling for debt effects. Meanwhile, Kiefer and Rada (2014), using a panel 

data  econometric  model  covering  the  period  of  1970  to  2012,  found  that  eight  in  13  European 

countries exhibited profit-led demand. They used an aggregative approach, and their results suggest 

that the empirical evidence remains controversial.  

Despite the identification strategy that was used in both studies, the utilization of large panel 

data models is scarce in the neo-Kaleckian empirical literature, given the difficulty of exploring large 

homogeneous  and  reliable  cross-country  datasets.  Hence,  most  studies  have  focused  on  a  single-

country time series econometric approach.3 

                                                             
2 The term neo-Kaleckian growth model is used to refer to models inspired by Rowthorn (1982), Dutt (1984), and Bhaduri 
and Marglin (1990). 
3  The  empirical  literature  on  wage-  and  profit-led  growth  is  extensive  and  fruitful,  so  a  complete  description  of  all 
initiatives is beyond our scope. See, e.g., Lavoie and Stockhammer (2013) and Blecker (2016) for complete review of the 
literature.

This extensive empirical effort also raised criticisms about the identification strategies of the 

models as well the political interpretations of their econometric results. For example, Blecker (2016) 

argued that the empirical literature is not paying sufficient attention to the time dimension, and that 

the distinction between short- and long-run effects requires a more detailed treatment. Palley (2013) 

emphasized the identification problems raised by possible nonlinearities in the specification of the 

neo-Kaleckian investment function. 

Skott (2015) raised a critical issue, arguing that the profit share is not a strictly exogenous 

variable. Hence, reduced form estimations between income distribution and economic growth are, in 

general, biased. In the same line, Razmi (2016) argued that this debate is misguided when applied to 

low-income countries, as it ignores the existence of non-tradable goods and the shortage of capital 

goods.  According  to  the  author,  when  such  aspects  are  properly  accounted  for  in  the  model,  the 

likelihood of the occurrence of wage-led regimes vanishes. 

The  present  paper  focuses  on  an  empirical  treatment  for  similar  endogenous  and  omitted 

variables  bias  problems.  We  explicitly  consider  a  possible  endogenous  relation  between  income 

distribution, economic growth, and international trade. Using the new Extended Penn World Table 

(EPWT, v. 6) (Marquetti, 2017), the paper proposes a new identification strategy, mainly based on 

the  Arellano  and  Bond  (1991)  approach to  panel  data.  Taking  a  different  route  from  the  previous 

literature, key tenets of the neo-Kaleckian investment function are respected. Hence, the identification 

strategy is based on several estimates of the stock of capital and the rate of capacity utilization for 61 

countries.  This  sample  is  heterogeneous,  containing  data  of  developed  and  developing  economies 

from 1995 to 2014. This heterogeneity raises the possibility of exploring the effect of structural cross-

country differences over the growth regimes. 

By controlling for possible endogenous relations, the omitted variables bias, and the structural 

cross-country heterogeneity, the present paper shows that average economic growth was wage led in 

developed  countries  over  the  period.  With  some  exceptions,  most  developing  countries  in  Latin 

America  and  Asia  exhibited  profit-led  growth  regimes.  Interestingly,  however,  while  in  Latin 

American developing countries the profit-led regimes occur through the international trade channel, 

in  other  developing  countries,  the  causality  channel  is  mainly  related  to  the  domestic  investment 

function. 

The reminder of this paper is organized as follows: The theoretical model, which is based on 

Badhuri  and  Marglin  (1990),  is  presented  in  Section  2.  The  identification  strategy  is  discussed  in 

Section 3. In Section 4, the main results are discussed as well the economic and political implications 

of the analysis. Finally, some concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.

2 The theoretical benchmark model 

The present section describes a neo-Kaleckian benchmark model based mainly on the seminal 

work  of  Dutt  (1984),  Rowthorn  (1984),  and  Badhuri  and  Marglin  (1990).  The  model  starts  by 

considering an economy in which a capitalist save a fraction 0 < 𝑠 < 1 of its gross profits 𝛱, but 

workers  as  a  class  do  not  save  their  wage  incomes  (Foley  and  Michl,  1999).  Hence,  the  savings 

function can be written as 𝑆 = 𝑠𝛱.                                                                         

In turn, the investment behavior relates the target rate of growth of capital to the expected rate 

of profit of entrepreneurs. The central idea is that if entrepreneurs expect a higher rate of profit, their 

animal spirits will be excited, and they will invest more. Mathematically, this post-Keynesian theory 

of investment can be represented by an equation that relates the level of investment to the actual gross 

profit. Hence, the investment function, I, is proportional to 𝛱: 𝐼 = 𝜂𝛱. 𝜂 is the propensity to invest 

out of profits.  

Both investment and saving functions can be normalized by the capital stock, a steady-state 

analysis. Hence, 

 

          

𝑆

𝐾

≡ 𝑔𝑆 = 𝑠𝑟,                                                                   (1) 

𝐼

𝐾

≡ 𝑔𝐼 = 𝜂𝑟.                                                                   (2)    

Marglin  and  Badhuri  (1990)  noted  that  we  can  decompose  the  profit  rate,  r,  into  three 

components: the profit-share, 𝜋, the rate of capacity utilization, u, and the output–capital ratio at full 

capacity, 𝜌, so that 𝑟 = 𝜋𝑢𝜌. In order to solve the investment and savings demand equations for the 

equilibrium level of capacity utilization, we can suppose a linear form of (2): 

 

𝑔𝐼 = 𝜂 + 𝜂𝜋𝜋 + 𝜂𝑢𝑢 + 𝜂𝜌𝜌,                                                       (3) 

 

where  𝜂  can  be  interpreted  as  the  autonomous  investment,  𝜂𝜋  is  the  sensitivity  of  investment  to 

variations  in  profit  share,  𝜂𝑢  is  the  impact  of  capacity  utilization  on  investment,  and  𝜂𝜌  is  the 

sensitivity of investment to variations in the output–capital ratio at full capacity. (1) and (3) form the 

Keynesian equilibrium condition in a closed economy.  

In an open economy, however, savings must be equal to planned investment plus net exports, 

NX. Thus, 𝑆 = 𝐼 + 𝑁𝑋 ≡ 𝐼 + 𝐸𝑋 − 𝑀, where E𝑋 is the exports and 𝑀 the imports.  Normalizing the 
net  exports  by  the  capital  stock,  𝑏 = 𝑁𝑋

𝐾⁄ ,  the  Keynesian  equilibrium  condition  for  an  open 

economy is equal to

                                                       𝑔𝑆 = 𝑔𝐼 + 𝑏.                                                                   (4) 

 

Following  Hein  and  Vogel  (2007),  Blecker  (1989),  and  Badhuri  and  Marglin  (1990),  we 

suppose that the net export rate is positively affected by international competitiveness. The Marshall–

Lerner  condition  is  supposed  to  hold,  and  the  sum  of  the  price  elasticities  of  exports  and  imports 

exceeds unity. Hence, the real exchange rate, 𝑒𝑅, positively affects the net exports rate. In addition, it 

is supposed that domestic demand, moving in line with the rate of capacity utilization, negatively 

affects the net exports rate. Hence, a linear form of the net exports rate can be written as follows: 

 

𝑏 = 𝜃𝑒𝑒𝑅(𝜋) − 𝜃𝑢𝑢,                                                             (5) 

 

where 𝜃𝑒, 𝜃𝑢 > 0. In addition, note that the real exchange rate is related to the profit share of income. 

The reasoning for this relationship lies in the relation between prices, distribution, and international 

competitiveness (see, e.g., Hein and Vogel, 2007; Blecker 1989). 

 

Using (5), (3), and (1) under the definition of the profit rate, r, in the Keynesian equilibrium 

condition (4), we can solve for the short equilibrium value of u:  

 

             

𝑢∗ =

𝜂+𝜂𝜋𝜋+𝜂𝜌𝜌+𝜃𝑒𝑒𝑅(𝜋)

𝑠𝜋𝜌−𝜂𝑢+𝜃𝑢

,                                                         (6) 

where the Keynesian short-run stability condition is supposed to hold. This means that the equilibrium 

value  for  u  will  be  stable  provided  that  the  denominator  of  (6)  is  positive.  Differentiating  the 

equilibrium  condition  with  respect  to  𝜋  to  measure  the  effect  of  changes  in  functional  income 

distribution on u, we have 

 

 

𝜕𝑢∗
𝜕𝜋

=

𝜂𝜋+𝜃𝑒𝑒𝑅

′ (𝜋)−𝑠𝜌𝑢

𝑠𝜋𝜌−𝜂𝑢+𝜃𝑢

.                                                           (7) 

While in a closed economy an increase in the profit share decreases the utilization rate, in an 

 

open economy, the sign of (7) remains ambiguous. Using the equilibrium value of u in (7), it can be 

seen that the signal will depend on the effect of profit share  on the net exports rate, 𝜃𝑒𝑒𝑅

′ (𝜋). The 

direction of the latter depends on the source of redistribution and can be either negative or positive 

(as discussed in detail by Hein and Vogel (2007)). 

 

Using  (6)  in  (3),  the  neo-Kaleckian  equilibrium  rate  of  accumulation,  g,  assuming  no 

depreciation, is given by 

 

5 

𝑔∗ = 𝑠𝜋𝜌 [

𝜂+𝜂𝜋𝜋+𝜂𝜌𝜌+𝜃𝑒𝑒𝑅(𝜋)

𝑠𝜋𝜌−𝜂𝑢+𝜃𝑢

].                                                    (8) 

In turn, the effect of a change in profit share on the rate of accumulation is equal to 

 

𝜕𝑔∗
𝜕𝜋

= 𝑠

𝜕𝑟

𝜕𝜋

≡ 𝑠[(𝜂𝜋 + 𝜃𝑒𝑒𝑅

′ (𝜋))𝜋 − (𝜂𝑢 − 𝜃𝑢)𝑢]

𝜌

𝑠𝜋𝜌−𝜂𝑢+𝜃𝑢

.                          (9) 

 

Note that the effect of changes in profit share on the rate of accumulation depends solely on 

the effects of profit share on the profit rate. In turn, the latter depends on the signal of the numerator 

of (9), 𝜑 ≡ (𝜂𝜋 + 𝜃𝑒𝑒𝑅

′ (𝜋))𝜋 − (𝜂𝑢 − 𝜃𝑢)𝑢. If 𝜑 > 0 is positive, the growth regime is called profit 

led. Otherwise, if 𝜑 < 0, the growth regime is called wage led. Interestingly, the causality channel 

for  this  result  may  be  heterogeneous.  For  example,  even  when  the  investment  rate  is  wage  led, 

economic growth may be profit led if the effects of changes in profit share on the net trade rate are 

positive and relatively high. By examining the limit cases, we also note the following: 

If 𝜂𝜋 = 0, we see that  

 

𝜕𝑔∗
𝜕𝜋

lim
𝜂𝜋→0

 

< 0 ↔ 𝜃𝑒𝑒𝑅

′ (𝜋)𝜋 − (𝜂𝑢 − 𝜃𝑢)𝑢 < 0. 

If 𝜂𝑢 = 0, on the other hand, 

 

𝜕𝑔∗
𝜕𝜋

lim
𝜂𝑢→0

 

> 0 ↔ (𝜂𝜋 + 𝜃𝑒𝑒𝑅

′ (𝜋))𝜋 + 𝜃𝑢𝑢 > 0. 

Hence, the impact of a change in profit share on economic growth depends on the coefficients 

of  the  investment  function and  the  net trade  rate,  leading  to the  distinction  between  wage-led  and 

profit-led growth regimes. 

 

3 The identification strategy 

The empirical strategy is utilized to correctly identify the investment function and net exports 

rate parameters in (9). Using a balanced panel data, the paper estimates two separate linear functional 

forms: one investment function (3) and one net exports rate (5). In this sense, the strategy is similar 

to  a  structural  approach  (Blecker,  2016).  The  empirical  form  of  (3)  and  (5)  can  be  written, 

respectively, according to the following equations: 

 

 

𝑔𝐼

𝑖𝑡 = 𝜇𝑖 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝜂𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜂𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑡 + 𝜂𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑡,                                  (10) 

6 

𝑏𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝛼𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑡 − 𝜃𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡.                                     (11) 

 

 

In (10), 𝛾𝑡 can account for the effect of technological progress (modeled as a set of temporal 

dummies);  𝜇𝑖  is  the  country-specific  effect,  which  controls  the  parameters  for  all  the  structural 

characteristics that are fixed over 1995 and 2014; and 𝜖𝑖𝑡 is the idiosyncratic perturbation term that 

varies  among  countries  and  time.  All  the  other  parameters  and  variables  retain  their  previous 

interpretations. In turn, 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the stochastic term in (11), while 𝛽𝑖 stands for the country fixed effect. 

𝛿𝑡 is a set of temporal dummies that are capturing all  the global effects in time, as the changes of 

global income. In this regard, since the global income, which obviously may affect international trade, 

is not changing among the countries, its marginal effects are algebraically the same as those captured 

by the set of temporal dummies. Following Hein and Vogel (2007), we model the effects of changes 

in profit share on the net exports rate in (11). Thus, 𝛼𝜋 is used to estimate 𝜃𝑒𝑒𝑅

′ (𝜋) in (9). 

Regarding the consumption function, which is estimated in some empirical models (Hein and 

Vogel, 2007), a comment is in order. The assumption that workers as a class consumed their whole 

wage does not, of course, rule out the possibility that individual workers might save. According to 

Foley  and  Michl  (1999),  this  classical  view  amounts  to  the  assumption  that  the  saving  of  some 

workers is matched by the dissaving of others. For empirical purposes, this rules out the possibility 

to  estimate  the  direct  effect  of  changes  in  profit  share  on  consumption  in  aggregate  demand. 

Therefore, the paper omits an explicit consumption function. Despite this theoretical basis, the reason 

is  also  empirical  and  is  related  to  the  difficultly  of  obtaining  compatible  and  reliable  data  on 

consumption  for  the  61  countries  of  the  sample.  However,  note  in  (8)  that  the  paradox  of  thrift 

continues to hold in the model. 

The main issue in (10) and (11) is how to model the specific effects of each country. Two 

techniques were used to address this. The first considers these effects as fixed, and a fixed effect (FE) 

estimator  is  used.  In  the  second,  given  the  possible  endogeneity  of  the  investment  function,  a 

Generalized  Method  of  Moments  (GMM)  estimator  is  used.  The  first  approach  estimates  the  FE 

model  via  dummies,  similar  to  Islam  (1995),  who  uses  a  country-specific  effect  to  allow  for  its 

correlation with other explanatory variables. FE models are also helpful for minimizing problems due 

to  the  omitted  variable  bias,  such  as  the  structural  characteristics  of  low-income  countries,  as 

recognized by Razmi (2016).  

The identification hypothesis from the FE model in (10) is as follows: the absence of a serial 

correlation between the idiosyncratic error and the explanatory variables plus the fixed effect, strict 

exogeneity,  is  𝐹𝐸1: 𝐸[𝜖𝑖𝑡|𝑥𝑖𝑗, 𝜇𝑖] = 0.  Full  rank,  the  variable  vector  x,  must  have  an  inverse 

𝐹𝐸2: 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝐸[𝑥𝑖𝑗′𝑥𝑖𝑗] = 𝑘.  Finally,  homoscedasticity  between  individuals  in  cross-sections  is 

assumed.  However,  this  hypothesis  is  related  to  the  correlation  among  the  error  terms  in  time,  or 
7 

 

𝐹𝐸1: 𝐸[𝜖𝑖𝑡𝜖𝑖𝑡′|𝑥𝑖𝑗, 𝜇𝑖] = 𝜎2𝜖𝐼𝑡.  The  same  identification  hypothesis  must  hold  for  the  FE  model 

estimated using (11). In general, details from FE models are very well known (see, e.g., Greene (2000) 

and Wooldridge (2002)).   

The second estimator uses instrumental variables to control for a possible endogenous effect 

in (10). As discussed above, a similar point was raised by Skott (2015), who argued that the profit 

share  is  not  a  strictly  exogenous  variable.  In  fact,  the existence  of a  possible  endogenous  relation 

between  variations  in  economic  growth  and  income  distribution  is  an  empirical  characteristic 

frequently ignored in  the literature. The point is that it does not logically follow from a particular 

theoretical specification, which supposes a certain degree of exogeneity of income distribution, that 

its functional form will obey the strict exogeneity assumption required for the consistent estimation 

of  econometric  models.  It  is  clear  that  an  empirical  estimation  of  an  investment  function  in  the 

presence of endogenous variables is no longer valid for the parameters of interest. 

The  endogeneity  issue  is  more  complex  than  usually  supposed,  as  its  economic  sense  of 

causality assumes different meanings with regard to the econometric technique adopted. In mostly 

time series non-stationary approaches, for instance, the meaning of causality is limited to temporal 

precedence.  This  is  not  the  interpretation  that  an  eventual  manipulation  of  the  cause  changes  the 

effects, as in robust panel data and microeconometrics models. Hence, even without going further in 

an  eventual  Lucas’s  critique,  the  endogeneity  per  se  challenges  most  results,  and  even  the  policy 

recommendations in this strand of literature. 

From a technical perspective, if the time is long enough in the regression, the FE model would 

not report a biased estimation. However, in the present instance, the period is from 1995 to 2014, and 

thus it may be influenced by endogeneity. A GMM estimator from Arellano and Bond (1991) is used 

to account for this possible effect.  

 

3.1. Sample and data  

 

The main data source is the new Extended Penn World Tables (EPWT v. 6.0) (Marquetti, 

2017).  It  is  organized  using  the  Penn  World  Table  (PWT  v.  9)  (Feenstra  et  al.,  2015)  and  other 

resources.  The  EPWT  presents  homogeneous  data  for  a  large  number  of  countries  for  the  years 

between 1967 and 2014. However, the methodological procedure for computing some of the EPWT 

variables is subject to criticisms, which are discussed in the respective documentation.4 

 

From the EPWT, we use the gross domestic product (GDP), X, the standardized fixed capital 

stock, K, and the investment, I, with all variables expressed in purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2011 

                                                             
4  The  EPWT  consist  of  two  parts,  a  document  in  Word  with  the  definition  and  methodological  procedure  for  the 
computation of each variable and an Excel file with the data.

international dollars. The standardized fixed capital stock is computed using the perpetual inventory 

method.  

 

Reliable data for capacity utilization over longer periods of time is difficult to obtain for 

cross-country analysis.  The paper uses the Hodrick–Prescott filter to estimate the potential output, 

𝑋𝑝,  for  each  country  between  1964  and  2014.  Hence,  from  the  HP  filter  we  compute  the  rate  of 

capacity  utilization,  𝑢 = 𝑋

⁄ ,  and  the  output-capital  ratio,  𝜌 =
𝑋𝑝

𝑋𝑝

⁄ ,  at  full  capacity.  This 
𝐾

procedure  for  estimating  the  capacity  utilization  is  not  free  of  criticisms.  Appendix  A  shows  the 

estimation of the rate of capacity utilization using distinct time series filters. 

 

The data on labor share in GDP and the exchange rate, 𝑒𝑅, is from the PWT. The real exchange 

rate is calculated as the ratio between the nominal exchange rate and the purchasing power parity 

conversion factor, the same as the EPWT. Some annual observations of the labor share are repeated 

or inconsistent in the PWT, so we excluded these countries from the analysis. We calculate the profit 

share, 𝜋, as one minus the labor share. Regarding the net trade balance, the data source is World Bank 

(2018).

The main panel is comprised of 61 countries from 1995 to 2014, being strongly balanced. The 

sample starts in 1995 due to several problems with past estimation of the labor share in the PWT. To 

 

9 

 

avoid complications with non-stationary time series, the paper uses five cohorts: 1995, 2000, 2005, 

2010, and 2014. All the level variables are included in the model as five-year averages of the previous 

years of the cohort. Therefore, the focus of the analysis is the long run. 

Figure 1 plots the rate of capacity utilization and the profit share in relation to the investment–

capital ratio and the net exports rate for the whole sample. While there is a clear positive association 

of functional distribution and capacity utilization with the investment rate, the relationship with net 

exports rate is difficult to infer.

The advantage of using panel data is the possibility to design different subsamples in search 

of more structural homogeneity among countries. The paper uses four groups of countries: Subsample 

A is composed of all the sample countries; Subsample B is composed of the 23 available developed 

countries.  Subsample  C  is  composed  of  the  14  developing  Latin  American  countries.  Finally, 

subsample D is composed of the other 12 developing countries, mostly in Asia. Table 1 describes the 

corresponding countries in each subsample. 

 

4 Results and discussion 

This section presents the results in stages. First, we discuss the results related to the investment 

function estimated from (10). Next, we present the results for the net exports rate estimated from (11). 

Then, we compute a country-specific estimate to verify whether average economic growth was wage 

or profit led in the period. 

Table 2 presents the results for the investment function in all the countries of the sample using 

the FE model and Arellano–Bond estimator. The output–capital ratio at full capacity is  statistically 

significant in all four models. The same is true for the rate of capacity utilization. In both cases, it is 

clear that the estimated parameter is relatively stable in each model. The Arellano–Bond model seems 

to improve the identification of the parameters.  

 

10 

It is interesting to note that the profit share is not statistically significant in the FE model. Its 

signal  is  unstable.  When  eventual  endogenous  effects  are  take into  account  in the  Arellano–Bond 

estimator,  the  parameter  turns  statistically  significant  only  in  the  model  without  time  dummies. 

However, when aggregate time series trends are included in the model, the positive effect of profit 

share on the investment function vanishes. In other words, the omitted variables bias from failing to 

control for year is positive due to  the aggregate rising trends in profit share and investment rate in 

most countries of the sample in the studied period.

From Table 2, we can thus conclude that the average domestic investment rate in the countries 

in the full sample of countries was wage led in the studied period. This result does not, of course, rule 

out the possibility that individual countries might have been profit led. However, even controlling for 

country-specific effects and endogeneity, this result is still overly aggregate. 

Table 3 presents results for subsample B,  which consists  only of developed countries. The 

output–capital ratio at full capacity is statistically significant in  all four model, and its elasticity is 

higher  than  that  of  the  full  sample  in  Table  2.  The  rate  of  capacity  utilization  is  also  statistically 

significant in all four models, and its elasticity is stable and relatively greater than in subsample A. 

Again, the Arellano–Bond estimator with time dummies improved the results. 

In turn, the profit share was not statistically significant. Its elasticity was negative, even when 

eventual endogenous effects are accounted for in the model. When aggregate time series trends are 

included  in  the  specification,  the  elasticity  of  the  profit  share  is  close  to  zero,  but  it  remains 

statistically not significant. Based on these results, the evidence in Table 3 suggests that the average 

domestic investment function was wage led in developed countries between 1995 and 2014.

The  results  for  the  estimation  of  the  investment  function  for  Latin  American  developing 

countries  are  presented  in  Table  4.  The  output–capital  ratio  at  full  capacity  is  not  statistically 

significant  in  the  Arellano–Bond  model.  Meanwhile,  the  rate  of  capacity  utilization  remains 

statistically significant in all four models. Its elasticity is relatively stable and improved when possible 

endogenous effects are controlled for in the regression. 

The  empirical  signal  of  the  profit  share  is  positive  and  statistically  significant  in  the  two 

models that do not control for the aggregate time series trends. When time dummies are included in 

the models, the parameters turn negative, even in the model  that controls for possible endogenous 

relations. However, both models fail to obtain statistically significance. Based on this evidence, we 

cannot  reject  the  possibility  that  the  average  domestic  investment  function  in  Latin  American 

developing countries was wage led in the studied period.

The results are relatively different in subsample D, which includes other developing countries, 

mostly in Asia. Table 5 presents the empirical investment function for these countries. The output 

 

12 

ratio at full capacity fails to achieve statistical significance in either of the Arellano–Bond models. 

The rate of capacity utilization is not statistically significant in the Arellano–Bond model with time 

dummies. In both cases, for 𝜌 and u, the elasticity associated with each variable is relatively stable. 

This non-significance is probably related to the size of the sample—60 observations in this case. 

Interestingly,  however,  the  profit  share  is  statistically  significant  in  all  four  models  at  the 

conventional critical values. Its parameter is relatively stable in both regressions, which suggests that 

possible endogenous effects are relatively weak in this subsample. The parameter remains relatively 

stable  even  when  the  aggregate  time  series  trend  is  included  in  the  specification.  Unlike  all  the 

previous subsamples, the average domestic investment function is profit led in subsample D.

Turning the focus to international trade, Table 6 presents the results of the regressions using 

the  Arellano  and  Bond  (1991)  model  for  the  net  exports  rate.  All  regressions  include  the  time 

dummies as a measure of the effect of changes in the global economy on the net exports rate. In the 

theoretical model, net exports are positively affected by the real exchange rate and negatively affected 

by the domestic rate of capacity utilization. The real exchange rate, in turn, is dependent on the profit 

share, whose signal is theoretically ambiguous. Now, we can empirically compute all these relations.  

The model fails to obtain statistical significance for the net exports rate in subsample A, which 

is,  in  fact,  too  aggregate.  The  reasons  can  be  inferred  from  Figure  1  above,  in  which  no  apparent 

relationship can be observed.  Hence, based on the results in Table 2 and 6, the average economic 

growth in these countries was characterized by a wage-led regime. Again, this result is still  overly 

aggregated to serve as a reliable general conclusion.

The model predicts that the rate of capacity utilization does not affect the net exports rate in 

developed  and  Latin  American  developing  countries.  Interestingly,  the  net  exports  are  positively 

affected by the profit share in both subsamples, B and C. The elasticity associated  with the profit 

share is higher in Latin American developing countries than in developed ones. 

In the case of subsample D, the model predicts that both the rate of capacity utilization and 

the profit rate negatively affect the net exports rate in the  studied period. However, the net exports 

respond relatively more to variations in the profit share. The negative signal associated with the profit 

share can be explained by the relationship between prices, distribution, and international competition 

in the neo-Kaleckian open economy model. In general, if a change in income distribution is caused 

by a change in the mark-up rate in these countries, we may observe an inverse relationship between 

the profit share and international competitiveness. 

The average effect of changes in profit share on the economic growth can now be calculated 

using the parametric results obtained from Tables 3, 4, 5, and (6) in the numerator of Equation (9). In 

order to do that, we compute the numerator of (9) as follows: 

 
                                         𝜑̅𝑖 ≡ (𝜂̂𝜋 + 𝛼̂𝜋)𝜋̅𝑖 − (𝜂̂𝑢 − 𝜃̂𝑢)𝑢̅𝑖,                                             (12) 

 

where the emphasis, 𝜂̂𝜋, indicates that the parameter is estimated, while the bar, 𝑢̅𝑖, indicates that we 

are using the average values of the respective variable over time. We use the parameters estimated by 

the Arellano–Bond model with time dummies, which controls for endogeneity and the aggregate time 

series trends. Each parameter is used only if it is statistically significant; otherwise we are unable to 

reject the null hypothesis. In other words, we cannot reject the possibility that the parameter is equal 

to zero. 

Table 7 shows the results for subsample B of developed countries. The estimated signal in 

(12) was negative. The result indicates that the average economic growth was wage led in the studied 

 

14 

period. In terms of the empirical literature, this result is in line with Onaran and Galanis (2012, 2013). 

The  authors  used  data  on  16  of  the  G20  countries  and  found  that  all  countries  in  their  sample, 

including  the  US  and  Japan,  had  wage-led  growth  regimes.  The  present  result  is  in  line  with  the 

general structural approach studies showing that the larger European countries and the Euro area as 

a whole are mainly characterized by wage-led growth. Some studies, however, often reach opposite 

conclusions about the US and Japan. For example, Storm and Naastepad (2012) found that the growth 

regimes in Japan and the US were profit led. The present result, however, focuses on the long run and 

finds that both countries were characterized by wage-led growth regimes between 1995 and 2014.

 The  results  for  subsample  C,  which  includes  Latin  American  developing  countries,  are 

presented in Table 8. The results indicate that the average growth of these countries in the  studied 

period were profit led. However, this result is explained by the positive effect that the profit share had 

on  the  net  exports  rate,  as  its  effects  on  the  domestic  investment  function  were  negative  (both 

economies are domestically wage led). The result is irrespective to the size of the economy or the 

degree of openness.

Two  Latin  American  developing  countries  reported  in  Table  8,  however,  had  an  average 

growth regime characterized by a wage-led regime: Colombia and Costa Rica. In these countries, the 

average profit share in income was relatively low, about 32% and 38%, respectively. These levels of 

profit share are similar to the average in developed countries.

Table  9  presents  the  estimated  results  for  subsample  D,  which  includes  other  developing 

countries. The average economic growth in these countries was characterized by a profit-led regime, 

as the signal of the parameter is positive. Despite the evidence that changes in profit share negatively 

 

16 

affect  the  net  exports  rate,  its  positive  effect  on  the  domestic  investment  function  is  leading  the 

average effect. The relatively weak effect of the rate of capacity utilization on the net exports rate 

also helps to explain the profit-led growth regime in  these countries. These results are also in line 

with some of the findings in the literature, especially those of Onaran and Galanis (2012, 2013). The 

authors found that several of the smaller or more open economies (Mexico, Argentina, India, South 

Africa, and China) had profit-led growth regimes. 

 

5 Conclusions 

The  extensive  empirical  effort  made  by  the  neo-Kaleckian  literature  to  estimate  whether 

economic growth is wage or profit led in different economies raised important criticisms about the 

identification  strategy  utilized  in the empirical  models  as  well  the  political  interpretations  of  their 

econometric results. This paper contributes to the empirical neo-Kaleckian literature on wage- and 

profit-led  growth  regimes  by  estimating  a  panel  data  model  in  which  country-specific  structural 

characteristics and possible endogenous relationships among the variables in the net exports rate and 

investment function are explicitly taken into account. 

To  do  this,  the  identification  strategy  uses  the  new  EPWT  (2017)  and  the  PWT  (2015)  to 

estimate an investment and net exports function between 1995 and 2014, under reasonable theoretical 

assumptions. Taking a different route from the previous literature, the paper attempts to respect key 

tenets of the neo-Kaleckian investment function. Hence, the identification strategy is based on several 

estimates of the stock of capital and the rate of capacity utilization for the 61 countries in the sample. 

Controlling for endogeneity and country-specific effects, a key result of the neo-Kaleckian 

empirical  literature  remains  true:  the  average  economic  growth  in  developed  countries  (large 

European  economies,  but  also  the  US  and  Japan)  was  wage  led  in  the  period.  The  present  result, 

however,  focuses  on  long-run  elasticities.  The  causality  channel  is  mainly  related to  the  domestic 

investment function, despite the positive effects that the profit rate had  on the average net exports 

rate. 

Meanwhile,  economic  growth  in  most  developing  countries  tends  to  be  profit  led. 

Remarkably,  however,  there  are  important  heterogeneities  in  the  results.  In  most  Latin  American 

developing countries, the domestic investment function is wage led, while the net exports rate is profit 

led. The exceptions to this are Colombia and Costa Rica, where the average profit share was at the 

level of the developed countries in the period.  

In  other  developing  countries,  primarily  in  Asia,  the  growth  regime  is  also  profit-led.  The 

causality channel, however, is different from that in Latin American countries. The average domestic 

investment function is profit led, while the net exports rate is negatively affected by the profit share.

In these countries, it is likely that the mark-up rate is affecting the profit share and thus international 

competitiveness. The effect of the rate of capacity utilization on the net exports is also negative.   

It is important to recognize, however, that  while the empirical relationship between income 

distribution  and  economic  growth  seems  to  suggest  the  existence  of  wage-  and  profit-led  growth 

regimes, it remains unclear whether the government can explore this relationship. All that the present 

results suggest is that the economic growth in those countries, with a relatively low profit share in 

income, was wage led in the studied period. However, this does not mean that redistribution towards 

wages in these economies would guarantee a future boost in economic growth.

Figure 2 presents the evolution  of different filter-based techniques to estimate the rate of capacity 
utilization for Brazil. The estimations are compared to the index of capacity utilization calculated by 
IBRE-FGV. The level is relatively different, but the average fluctuations are relatively similar. The 
pattern is also similar in other countries.
