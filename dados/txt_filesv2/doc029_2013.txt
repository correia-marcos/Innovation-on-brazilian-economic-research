Introduction 

The arrival of the American & Foreign Power Co. Inc. in Brazil and Argentina indicated the beginning 
of the expansion of US  direct investment to seek new consumer  markets abroad  in the 1920s. As refers to 
electricity market, this expansion launched the entrance of large national groups in Latin America. Between 
1929  and  1955,  American  &  Foreign  Power  was  the  largest  US  private  equity  investor  in  the  region. 
However,  the  company  arrived  on  the  scene  more  than  twenty  years  after  other  major  electricity  firms. 
Despite  an  aggressive  expansion  through  subsidiaries  throughout  Latin  America,  in  countries  where 
electricity was already a reality—such as Brazil and Argentina—this American holding company established 
itself  through  brownfield-type  investments  in  markets  served  by  large  multinational  electricity  holding 
companies. 

Following  the  establishment of  its  subsidiaries  and the  implementation  of  strategies  to  both  improve 
the  services  provided  and  to  ensure  higher  returns,  the  company  suffered  deeply  during  the  worldwide 
economic  crisis  that  began  in  1929:  it  faced  difficulty  in  securing  capital  for  the  business,  while  the 
devaluation  of  national  currencies  and  the  increase  of  government  intervention  in  the  electricity  sector 
impacted negatively on profits. In short, throughout the 1930s and 1940s the performance of the American & 
Foreign  Power’s  subsidiaries  highly  depended  on  the  tense  relations  between  shareholders,  domestic 
consumers, and local governments. 

This article analyses the trajectory and performance of  American &  Foreign Power in  Argentina and 
Brazil,  focusing  on  its  investment  strategies  and  the  business–state  relations.  Section  II  reviews  the 
establishment of  American &  Foreign Power in  Brazil and  Argentina,  looking at its early expansion in the 
US  and  examining  the  company's  strategies  in  organising  electric  utility  businesses  in  both  markets  in  the 
interwar period. It also reviews the evolution of American & Foreign Power’s subsidiaries in Argentina and 
Brazil, noting the profound change in the company’s involvement in both countries. Section III analyses the 
shift  of  the  regulatory  strategies  and  describes  the  Business-State  relations  in  both  countries.  Finally,  the 
article  identifies  the  basic  conditions  that  explain  the  different  trajectory  of  the  holding  company  in  both 
countries, as well as the reasons  behind  its decision to divest  from  its  subsidiaries  in the region  in the  late 
1950s.

American & Foreign Power’s businesses in Latin America (1923-50) 

a)  From Electric Bond & Share to  American & Foreign Power: American FDI in electric utilities 

in Argentina and Brazil 

At  the  end  of  the  First  World  War,  US  foreign  policy  underwent  a  change.  The  armed  conflict 
demanded a strong presence of the US, by funding the Allies and on the battlefield itself. With Europe war-
weary and debt-laden, the US emerged as the great new industrial power and financial center of the world.1 
South America, like many other regions of the globe, received greater attention from American businesses: 
investment  in  the  region  increased  in  volume  and  diversified  into  new  sectors,  such  as  the  industrial,  and 
particularly  infrastructure.2  In  Argentina  and  Brazil,  the  capital  invested  in  infrastructure  accounted for  45 
per cent and 50 per cent respectively of total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from the United States.

The expansion of US FDI in public utilities was dominated by a few large holding companies, which 
financed their new investments through the boom in the stock market.3 At the top of a pyramidal structure, 
financial holding companies controlled the operation of public utility holding companies, which in turn were 
responsible for local utilities across several countries.4 Electric Bond & Share, created in 1905, was a typical 
example of this strategy. In 1915-16, Bond & Share sought the opportunity to develop electricity companies 
in Latin America, as a result of a discussion between Sydney Z. Mitchell  –chairman of Bond & Share- and 
representatives of General Electric Co., its parent company at the time. They agreed to acquire a number of 
gas,  telephone,  electricity,  and  tramway  companies  in  Panama.  In  1919,  Electric  Bond  &  Share  moved  to 
Guatemala,  following  the  same  strategy  to  Cuba  in  1922.  In  1923,  the  company  organised  American  & 
Foreign Power and transferred its Latin American holdings. By 1925, Bond & Share controlled five holding 
companies  in  electric  utilities,  mostly  operating  in  the  USA:  American  Gas  And  Electric  Co.  (1906), 
American Power & Light Co. (1909), National Power & Light Co. (1921); American & Foreign Power Co. 
(1923), and Electric Power & Light Corp. (1925).5  

Electric  Bond  &  Share’s  initial  investments  were  located  in  countries  close  to  US  national  interest, 
such as Panama, Guatemala, and Cuba. Business success in these low-risk investments, might have given US 
companies the confidence to proceed to new markets in the second half of the 1920s. Even though most of 
these  economies  were  dependent  on  commodity  exports,  it  was  a  propitious  moment  to  expand  direct 
investment in the growing economies of Latin America and the Caribbean as the growth of urban population 
and industrial activities would increase the demand of electricity. 6 

Nevertheless, the group’s expansion into Latin America occurred too late. The pioneering strategy of 
General Electric7—one of the largest electrical manufacturing corporations —of concentrating businesses in 
the  US  did  not  guarantee  its  preeminence  in  Latin  America.  In  Argentina  and  Brazil,  the  entry  of  major 
foreign electricity companies had occurred nearly three decades prior to the arrival of American & Foreign 
Power.  By  the  First  World  War,  the  cities  of  Buenos  Aires  and  Rosario,  already  had  granted  electricity 
concessions  to  large  companies  like  the  German  DUEG  (Deutsch  Uberseeische  Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft, 
CATE in Spanish); the Belgian SER (Société d'Electricité de Rosario), a subsidiary of the holding company 
SOFINA  (Société  Financière  de  Transports  et  d'Entreprises  Industrielles);  while  the  Canadian  Light  & 
Power had obtained the concession to provide services in the most populous cities of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro 
and Sao Paulo.8 Therefore, American & Foreign Power’s strategy in these two countries focused on trying to 
win over secondary markets, such as regional capitals or towns scattered throughout the country. Still, these 
concessions covered a number of medium and small communities in a widespread area, as shown by Table 
2.

Moreover,  the  electricity  companies  taken  over  by  the  group  not  only  shared  problems  of  financial 
management  and  technological  development,  but  also  diverse  contractual  terms  set  out  in  the  various 
concessions  granted  by  local  authorities.  Unlike  the  first  experience  of  the  American  group  abroad  in  the 
Caribbean  countries,  the  concessions  acquired  in  Argentina  and  Brazil  were  previously  owned  by  local 
groups  or  by  foreign  companies  -mainly  British-  operating  with  obsolete  technology  under  different 
jurisdictions.  On  that  ground,  one  priority  for  the  company  was  to  renegotiate  the  concession  agreements 
with local authorities to build a homogeneous regulatory framework that would ensure future investments. In 
particular,  the  prevailing  terms  imposed  flat  rates  on  different  services,  creating  barriers  to  electricity 
consumption,  instead  of  regressive  tariffs.9  Secondly,  new  investments  were  required,  as  plants  using 
obsolete technology and electricity grids poorly integrated did not generate economies of scale.  

According to 1929 report, American & Foreign Power intended to take over the financial organisation 
of  the  operating  subsidiaries,  expanding  the  capacity  of  their  plants  and  modernising  transmission  and 
distribution  systems.  Moreover,  it  expected  to  develop  new  forms  of  energy  use,  applying  special  rates to 
promote a growth in electricity consumption and a greater variety of electric energy use. Plans also extended 
to  new  forms  of  operation  and  accounting  methods,  as  well  as  the  establishment  of  relationships  between 
companies and local communities. In short, the modernisation project sought to develop more efficient and 
profitable systems.10 

In  Brazil,  the  electricity  supply  faced  two  strategic  challenges  in  the  1920s:  building  integrated 
regional  systems  to  supply  more  energy  to  diversified  consumer  markets;  and  implementing  cost-saving 
innovations, as rising coal pricing had increased production costs in the First World War. 11 Hydroelectricity 
could  be an option  for the  financial success of utilities, but also demanded  huge resources to assemble the 
system, which were unavailable to local entrepreneurs. 

In this context, American & Foreign Power acquired the Companhia Brasileira de Energia Elétrica, an 
electricity distributor in Salvador (Bahia) and cities in the state of Rio de Janeiro, which withdrew from the 
business in the early 1920s as long as it could not afford the expansion of the electricity supply during the

Great War.12 In the state of São Paulo, American & Foreign Power took advantage of a decentralised system, 
with a few regional companies such as  Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL), to start an integration 
project through transmission lines.13 This project would allow the company to substitute costly and obsolete 
thermoelectric  power  plants  by  hydroelectric  dams—more  distant,  but  with  greater  power-generating 
capacity. 

By  acquiring  small  and  medium  concessions  through  the  stock  market, the  company  quickly  gained 
large concession areas. Between 1927 and 1939, the American company expanded its Brazilian market from 
78 to 309 cities served. In this context, two subsidiaries were established: Companhia Auxiliar de Empresas 
Elétricas  Brasileiras  (CAEEB)—initially  called  Empresas  Elétricas  Brasileiras—and  the  Companhia 
Brasileira de Força Elétrica, both active in the interior of São Paulo state, an economically important coffee 
region. CAAEB also engaged to supply electric power to regional capitals (Table 3).14

In Argentina, the most significant change in the power sector during the first postwar period was the 
transfer  of  DUEG-CATE  to the  Belgian  firm  SOFINA,  which  took  control  of  the  electricity  and  tramway 
systems  in the  nation’s  largest  markets by  population and  income. In parallel, an Italian-Swiss consortium 
led by CIAE (Compañia Ítalo-Argentina de Electricidad) constituted itself through the acquisition of plants 
located  in  small  towns.15  Both  groups  increased  their  investments  in  order  to  expand  the  capacity  of  their 
power  plants  and  to  extend  distribution  networks.  In  an  environment  of  heightened  demand,  the  increased 
production  and  consumption  resulting  from  these  investments  generated  economies  of  scale,  thereby 
increasing the profitability of companies mainly located in the coastal region of the pampas (the provinces of 
Buenos Aires and southern Santa Fe).16 In the rest of the country, electric utilities continued to be provided 
by various separate British and Argentine companies until the arrival of American & Foreign Power. These 
companies  operated  low  capacity  hydroelectric  and  thermoelectric  power  plants.17  Unlike  in  Brazil, 
hydroelectric power generation was not important in Argentina: in 1930, the hydroelectric plants in Córdoba 
and Tucumán accounted for only 6 per cent of overall production. 

Between  1928  and  1932,  American  &  Foreign  Power  acquired  19  electricity  companies,  and 
reorganised them by region into five firms (see Table 4), which aimed to reduce the number of concession 
contracts.  New  commercial  departments  and  sale  offices  introduced  marketing  strategies  to  foster Electric 
Bond  &  Share’s  businesses.  In  the  late  1930s  the  company  had  58  offices  and  shops,  whose  sales  of 
electrical equipment totaled 2 million pesos. By 1933, after eliminating common stocks and updating fixed 
assets, the financial reorganisation of the subsidiaries came to an end.

 In this early 1930s context, American & Foreign Power consolidated its position in the Argentine and 
Brazilian  markets.  In  Argentina,  it  generated  12  per  cent  of  overall  electricity  production,  making  it  the 
second  largest  company  in  the  sector,  but  still  well  behind  SOFINA,  whose  subsidiaries  generated  53  per 
cent  of  the  country's  electricity.  In  Brazil,  the  industry  structure  was  similar:  American  &  Foreign  Power 
accounted  for  almost  20  per  cent,  while  Canadian  Light  grabbed  50  per  cent  of  Brazil's  electricity 
generation.18  Although  the  American  company  remained  in  secondary  markets,  it  reached  a  prominent 
position due to the  volume of  investments. In terms of assets  invested abroad  it was the  largest electricity 
company  in  the  world  in  1937,  with  US  $534  million  invested  in  its  subsidiaries  in  11  countries.  The 
Canadian group Brazilian Traction, Light and Power (Light) came second with US  $425  million, followed 
by  Belgian  firms  SOFINA  and  Electrobel  in  third  and  fourth  place,  with  US  $398  million  and  US  $217 
million in assets respectively.19 
 

b)   Reversal of the investment scenario in 1930.  
In the early years of operations, American & Foreign Power developed an expansion program financed 
by  issuing  US  $50  million  of  funded  debt  securities  and  shares,  representing  an  investment  of  US  $358 
million,  supplemented  by  a  substantial  reinvestment  of  profits.  However,  1930  marked  the  end  of  this 
expansion. The company needed large amounts of capital to meet its commitments for property acquisition 
and construction projects. For both purposes the company issued another US $50 million of gold debentures, 
of which 42.5 million were sold to the public. As a consequence of the international economic crisis, public 
financing dried up and the holding company turned to its parent company, Bond & Share, obtaining a loan of 
US $30 million at 6 per cent interest. In the following years, and American & Foreign Power was not able to 
service  its  bank  loans,  which  amounted  to  US  $50  million,  and  had  to  renegotiate  them  at  higher  interest 
rates. Bond & Share granted a new loan of US $5 million, for a total of US $35 million, renegotiated at a 7 
per cent interest rate.22 

In  addition  to  financial  restrictions,  exchange  rate  losses  and  the  economic  downturn,  negatively 
impacted  on  the  profitability  of  Latin  American  subsidiaries.  From  1933  to  1939,  American  &  Foreign 
Power paid no dividends to its shareholders and electricity business stood still, while current incomes were 
dedicated to pay loan interests.23 

This situation did not improve until Second World War. By 1941, bank debt was reduced to only US 
$15.5  million dollars, and  so did the  interest rate (3 per cent). Nevertheless, the US  $35  million  borrowed 
from Bond & Share remained at a rate of 7 per cent. In 1943, bank loans were entirely repaid and the debt 
loan with Bond & Share became an overdue obligation at an interest rate of 6 per cent, according to the laws 
of  the  State  of  New  York.  In  1944,  American  &  Foreign  Power  resumed  payments  to  Bond  &  Share,

amortising US $5 million, and the remaining US  $30 million became notes at 3 per cent.24 Local currency 
devaluations  and  restrictions  on  foreign  currency  remittances  ceased  during  the  Second  World  War,  when 
Latin American exports rose and currencies began to appreciate.25 From 1940 onwards, profits recovered and 
the company resumed partial payment of dividends as indebtedness decreased.   

Since  the  enactment  of  the  Public  Utility  Holding  Company  Act,  Electric  Bond  &  Share  introduced 
new forms of corporate governance. Interlocking-directorates had been the main strategy of Electric Bond & 
Share to control its holding companies, but in 1935, policies of corporate governance changed to elude the 
regulations  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Comission.  The  financial,  technical,  legal,  and  administrative 
services delivered to American & Foreign Power by its parent company were undertaken by Ebasco Services 
Incorporated (EBASCO), another subsidiary of Bond & Share.26 American & Foreign Power’s directorship 
was renewed, but Bond & Share still controlled the managerial decisions by its majority voting power. From 
1937 to 1944, Bond  & Share owned 76.8 per cent of common  stock voting rights  in  American  &  Foreign 
Power,  dropping  to  40.2  per  cent  in  1952.  By  the  second  postwar  period,  American  &  Foreign  Power 
contributed 21 per cent of Bond & Share’s revenues in shares and interests, and 11.3 per cent of its revenues 
through dividends.28

The  stagnation  of  public  financing  via  international  market  restricted  the  development  of  the 
investment plan of the US- holding company, particularly  in  Argentina. Against the backdrop of the Great 
Depression,  the  prospect  of  modernising  management  and  services  was  compromised  on  account  of  the 
financial issues and a decreasing profitability in foreign currency. 

In  the  early  1930s,  the  company’s  situation  in  Brazil  was  not  as  critical  as  in  Argentina  thanks  to 
investments made by the former concessionaires in the 1920s. In the states of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, the 
company  could  take  advantage  of  midsize  hydroelectric  plants:  Bananeiras  (9000  kW)  serving  the  city  of 
Salvador,  and  Alberto  Torres  (9000  kW)  and  Fagundes  (4800  kW)  serving  the  interior  of  Rio  de  Janeiro 
state. Therefore, in those states, projects only sought the expansion of existing generating plants, such as the 
enlargement of the Paraguaçu River reservoir which served the Bananeiras plant.29 

The  Cia  Força  e  Luz  de  Minas  Gerais,  serving  the  state  capital  of  Minas  Gerais,  Belo  Horizonte, 
maintained the hydroelectric plant Rio das Pedras (11,800 kW); in Curitiba, capital of Paraná, the Chaminé 
(8000  kW)  plant  was  completed  in  1931,  allowing  the  thermoelectric  plant  to  be  decommissioned.  In 
Brazil’s  Northeast,  on  the  other  hand,  the  capital  cities  of  Maceio,  Recife,  and  Natal  depended  on 
thermoelectric power plants, which drove up the cost of services. Before the Second World  War, the  most 
that  American  &  Foreign  Power  could  undertake  in  these  cities  was  the  expansion  of  the  thermoelectric 
plants or the construction of  smaller ones.  Companies  in  Rio Grande do Sul  faced the same scenario andº 
their thermoelectric plants were enlarged in 1932 and 1937.30  

                                                

24 Electric Bond & Share paid no dividends either. The renegotiation of its loans produced a deficit from 1941. By 1945, 45 per 
cent  of  the  firm’s  revenues  came  from  its  interests  in  controlled  companies  and  55  per  cent,  from  dividends.  Electric  Bond  &

In São Paulo, the company inherited a rather dispersed system of small hydroelectric plants, including 
one  of  the  largest,  the  Marimbondo  Hydroelectric  Plant,  which  opened  in  1928  (8000  kW).  There,  the 
Companhia Paulista Força e Luz (CPFL)31 was concerned about connecting local plants to form a new 450 
km-regional grid. Moreover, American & Foreign Power agreed to integrate  a regional power grid together 
with  Brazilian  Traction  -Light's  parent  company-  in  capital  cities  of  São  Paulo  and  Rio  de  Janeiro.  By 
integrating  the  transmission  network,  CPFL  reached  an  optimal  load  factor  as  it  expanded  the  number  of 
cities and population served up to 259 cities and more than 3.2 million people in São Paulo state by the end 
of Second World War. After 1945, the company needed to accelerate new plant construction projects, such 
as the Peixoto site.32 

Consequently,  the  performance  of  American  &  Foreign  Power  in  Brazil  was  quite  auspicious  in  the 
1930s. On the upside, taking advantage of the improvements made by earlier concessionaries, it did not need 
to  invest  in  costly  works  such  as  new  hydroelectric  plants.  In  1929-39,  its  revenues  fluctuated  around  an 
average of US $10 million, despite the devaluation of the Brazilian currency. During the war, the exchange 
rate recovered and the company's revenues increased, reaching over US$19 million in 1945.33 

In  Argentina,  the  1929  plan  for  financial  reorganisation,  reducing  the  number  of  concessions,  and 
promoting sales of electrical equipment were ongoing, but the US $7.5 million investment project to expand 
the systems was never carried out.34 Nevertheless, profitability of the Argentine subsidiaries increased both 
in local currency and US dollars since 1935. Incomes in US Dollars grew at a moderate rate (3-4 per cent) in 
1934-37 as the Argentinean currency depreciated, but rising fuel costs and wages affected operating profits 
from  1937  on.  At  the  outbreak  of  the  Second  World  War,  the  appreciation  of  the  local  currency  and  the 
increase of the country's gold reserves caused operating and net revenues to boost; and so did profits as the 
interest  rates  of  company  loans  dropped.35  The  revenues  of  the  Argentine  subsidiaries  continued  to  grow 
until 1946, but as shown in Table 5, the annual growth rate began to slow down in 1943, when the military 
regime paved the way to the expropriation of American & Foreign Power’s subsidiaries.

Before  the  expropriations,  American  &  Foreign  Power’s  businesses  in  Argentina  were  stable  but 
unsatisfactory,  insofar as the problems encountered  in the diagnosis of 1929 remained unresolved. Despite 
the improvement of electricity networks by building transmission lines to connect  small cities, the systems 
operated by this company did not developed economies of scale, nor were they integrated as those systems 
controlled by CIAE and SOFINA. Few investments applied to increase generating capacity, compared with 
those in Brazil and other Latin American countries. The option of financing in the local market, as practiced 
in 1941, produced no results.36 Consequently, electricity supply was poor, leading to numerous conflicts with 
local authorities. 

The  earnings  of  American  &  Foreign  Power’s  subsidiaries  in  Latin  America,  excepting  for  Chile, 
followed  a  similar  path  until  the  end  of  Second  World  War:  stable  revenues  until  the  mid-1930s,  with 
minimal growth afterwards. The poor performance of company’s businesses in 1931-46 resulted from its low 
investments to improve the electricity systems as the Great Depression  blocked the ability to raise capital. 
Moreover, towering  indebtedness with  banks  and with the parent company Electric  Bond  &  Share at high 
interest  rates,  in  addition  to  currency  exchange  losses  in  Latin  America,  limited  the  resources  for  self-
financing.  The  stagnation  of  investments  in  electricity  systems  is  confirmed  by  the  evolution  of  the 
generating capacity by country, shown in Figure 1.

After a decade of  stagnation,  in 1946 generating  capacity  began to increase  in all countries, with the 
exception of  Argentina, where expropriations stopped the company’s  investment of  capital.  As  a result,  in 
1955,  the  generating  capacity  of  American  &  Foreign  Power’s  subsidiaries  in  Argentina  was  33  per  cent 
lower than in 1932, even though the number of customers served and production were slightly higher. While 
the Brazilian subsidiaries expanded their generating power capacity in almost 95,000 kW, and the Mexican 
and Chilean around 38,000 and 25,000 kW, respectively, the Argentine subsidiaries expanded by only 8,500 
kW in the postwar period.37 

As of 1950, capital expenditures in the electricity power industry revived, especially applied to renew 
the  equipment,  mechanisation,  and  the  installation  of  high  capacity  generating  units.  In  this  period  a  new 
financing  model  for  the  electricity  industry  emerged,  based  largely  on  long-term  loans  with  international 
banks  and  in  a  much  more  cautious  manner,  by  issuing  securities.  The  revival  of  investments  increased 
revenues for the subsidiaries operating in Latin America (excluding Argentina), which reached their peak in 
1953. In 1960, another important change in the business history of the American company took place with 
the expropriation of its Cuban subsidiary, a scenario that extended to other locations, including the process 
of expropriations in Brazil and the sale of Mexican subsidiaries. In this new scenario, the operating revenues 
fell by half, marking the final chapter of the group’s venture in Latin America.38  

In  addition  to  the  devaluation  of  the  exchange  rate,  the  company  had  to  deal  with  changes  in  the 
regulatory  framework  for  the  electricity  sector  and  the  unprecedented  initiatives  of  the  State.  Central 
governments intervened differently in each country in the 1930s, but their role was certainly decisive in the 
evolution of the business of American & Foreign Power’s subsidiaries by the 1940s.

American  &  Foreign  Power’  directors  could  not  imagine,  however,  that  the  effects  of  the  Great 
Depression on Latin America economic policy would be so painful and long lasting. Their main concern was 
that currency devaluation would damage the sustainability and profitability of their investments: rising prices

Moreover, 
governments  restricted  currency  remittances  in  Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  Colombia,  Costa  Rica,  and 
Ecuador.39 In this context, foreign companies and governments clashed over the standard of public utilities, 
but the timing and patterns of government intervention differed greatly in Brazil and Argentina. 40  

Brazilian  electricity  policies  shifted  during  the  administration  of  Getúlio  Vargas  in  1930-45.  All 
decisions  about  electric  utilities  were  centralised  and  transferred  from  the  local  authorities  to  the  Federal 
government,  concessions  for  perennial  water  courses  and  waterfalls  were  suspended,  the  exploitation  of 
hydropower was undertaken by the central government. In 1932, Minister Juarez Távora created a board for 
issues concerning hydropower exploration and regulation of water resources at the Departamento Nacional 
de Produção Mineral [National Department of Mineral Production]. 41 It was, however, the suspension of the 
gold  clause  (Decree  No.  23501,  1933),  which  confronted  the  interests  of  foreign  utility  companies.  The 
adjustment of electricity tariffs to gold, reduced the effects of currency devaluation on the company’s current 
incomes  in US  dollars  after 1930. In 1934, with the  new Brazilian  constitution, the  Water Code—the  first 
national legislation on water and electricity—was finally enacted.42  

These  state  control  policies  clearly  upset  the  electricity  companies,  especially  the  foreign  ones. 
However, the regulation of electricity tariffs and restrictions on private access to waterfalls —enforced from 
1937  to  1942—  did  not  threaten  the  electricity  concessions  managed  by  Light  and  American  &  Foreign 
Power.  However,  the  role  of  the  government  shifted  through  the  creation  of  CHESF  (Companhia 
Hidrelétrica do São Francisco) in 1945, to overcome electricity deficit in the surrounding area. In parallel, 
other regionally-oriented state-owned enterprises were created from the late 1940s to the 1950s. 

In  Argentina,  on  the  other  hand,  local  concessions  prevailed  in  the  interwar  period,  except  in  those 
provinces  such  as  Córdoba  and  Tucumán  that  relied  on  water  resources  (whose  use  was  regulated  by 
provincial governments).43 Local  concessions set  minimal standards of  service provision,  maximum tariffs 
adjustable to gold price, and in some cases, the reversion of the initial investment to the municipality at the 
end  of  concession.  Electricity  companies  were  exempt  from  paying  import  taxes  for  raw  materials  and 
equipment,  only paying an  annual  fee that ranged between 2 and 6 percent of gross  incomes. In the  most 
populated cities, such as Buenos Aires and Rosario, the concessions extended for 50 years—in Brazil up to 
90 years—but in other Argentine cities concessions lasted between 20 and 25 years. 

The impact of the 1930 crisis on the exchange rates and revenues, led to the first attempts at regulation 
by local governments. Municipal commissions for electricity companies were created in the cities of Buenos 
Aires and Rosario, as well as in the provinces of Tucumán and Cordoba.44 Based on the criteria of the US 
Federal Trade Commission, their reports revealed assets overvaluation and excessive profits. On top of it all, 
the quality of service was poor. Municipalisation was recommended; however, the regulatory framework did 
not change until 1943. 

The  military,  who  seized  power  in  1943,  changed  the  regulatory  strategy  for  electric  utilities.45  A 
decade  after  the  first  regulations  in  Brazil,  the  Argentine  government  took  more  radical  actions,  not  only 
introducing  discretionary  regulation  but  also  creating  federal  agencies  to  manage  electric  utilities. 
Diagnosing  that  the  energy  deficit  was  one  of  the  main  obstacles  to  economic  and  industrial  growth,  the 
national  government  created  the  Dirección  Nacional  de  la  Energía  [National  Agency  of  Energy],

responsible  for  overseeing  the  production  and  distribution  of  energy  and  promoting  the  development  of 
renewable energy sources. The Ministry of Interior also established two investigative commissions charged 
with reviewing the foreign power concessions in Buenos Aires and the rest of the country, and ordered rate 
reductions of around 20 per cent, while suggesting the possibility of expropriating public utility assets.46 

Electricity  policy  was  integrated  with  the  planning  of  the  National  Post-War  Council  (1944),  which 
gave  priority  to  the  development  of  hydroelectric  energy  production  to  reduce  fuel  consumption  by 
thermoelectrical plants.47 The transition from local concessions to centralised management of resources also 
motivated the creation of the National Water Administration, an agency responsible for coordinating water 
uses  throughout  the  territory.48  Implementation  of  the  plan  was  the  responsibility  of  a  new  agency,  the 
Dirección  General  de  Centrales  Eléctricas  Estatales  [General  Department  of  State  Power  Plants],  whose 
mission was to plan, construct, and operate electric power plants and distribution networks.49  

The reports of the inquiry commissions recommended to suspend the legal status of concessions and to 
expropriate the foreign subsidiaries. However, the national government opted to send the documentation to 
the provincial governments which would take the necessary steps, thereby transferring the decision whether 
or not to expropriate to the provinces. Provincial authorities in the provinces of Tucumán, Jujuy, Corrientes, 
Mendoza,  Santa  Fe,  Entre  Rios,  Cordoba,  and  San  Luis  began  to  expropriate  small  plants  belonging  to 
American  &  Foreign  Power’s  subsidiaries.50  The  reasons  given  were  the  problematic  status  of  the  plants, 
whose  obsolete  equipment  prevented  efficient  provision  of  service  and  whose  limited  capacity  left  them 
unable to meet demand.51 

By 1946, among the 14 companies expropriated, 11 were American  & Foreign Power’s subsidiaries. 
The expropriation mainly affected small plants in the north and center of the country which used hydraulic 
and  thermal  energy;  however  some  larger  plants  were  expropriated  as  well,  such  as  those  located  in  the 
province  of  Córdoba.  Notably,  large  thermal  power  plants  located  in  the  most  populated  regions  of  the 
country,  belonging  to  the  SOFINA  and  the  Italian-Swiss  group,  were  not  expropriated.  Expropriation 
decisions were based on the diagnosis that the electricity deficit was concentrated in cities in the interior of 
the  country,  and  that  the  installation  of  new  power  plants  would  contribute  to  decentralise  industrial 
agglomerations  and  stimulate  the  growth  of  regional  economies.  The  state  intervention  in  this  area  would 
also promote the use of water resources to reduce  fossil  fuel  consumption.52 Moreover, the compensations 
for those expropriated assets were substantially less than the potential costs of expropriating the large plants 
owned by SOFINA.  

Compared  to  the  Brazilian  experience  of  the  1940s,  expropriations  in  Argentina  were  more  radical. 
While  the  Argentine  provincial  governments  expropriated  electricity  plants,  the  Brazilian  government 
followed a policy of rapprochement with the US. By 1947, American & Foreign Power’ directors agreed to 
the government’s view:  it was time to reinvest in the electricity sector and review tariff structures to ensure 
higher  revenues.  The  difficulty  of  raising  funds  in  the  financial  market  led  to  the  strategy  of  seeking 
resources  from  international  lending  institutions,  such  as  the  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and

Development (IBRD) and the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Eximbank).53 From the end of the 
Second  World  War  to  1956,  both  institutions  invested  more  than  US  $450  million  in  Latin  American 
electricity  sector,  especially  in  Brazil  and  Mexico  (Table  6).  As  a  result  of  the  expropriations  of  US 
subsidiaries, Argentina was denied access to these sources of capital.

In Brazil, Light received over US $91 million from IBRD, while American & Foreign Power received 
US  $47  million  from  Eximbank.  State  enterprises  together  received  a  total  of  US  $57  million,  which  was 
invested in CHESF and other state-owned companies in Rio Grande do Sul (CEEE), Minas Gerais (Cemig), 
and São Paulo (CESP). In 1948 alone American & Foreign Power’s expenditures came to US $6.2 million, 
distributed among eight subsidiaries and funding projects like CPFL’s Carioba Thermal Power Plant (30,000 
kW)  in São Paulo state. The amount of the  loan  would  jump to more than US  $40  million  by 1952, when 
CPFL became responsible for a US $30 million investment for the construction of the  Peixoto Plant, one of 
the  largest  in  the  world  at  that  time,  allowing  the  subsidiary  to  increase  its  generating  capacity  by  65  per 
cent. The plant was inaugurated in 1957 and it reached an annual production of 192,000 kW by 1960. 54 

To sum up, in the 1950s the situation of American & Foreign Power in Brazil and Argentina was quite 
different:  while the uncertainty already pointed to  a definitive exit  from  Argentina, the electricity sector in 
Brazil  offered  the  prospect  of  continuity,  especially  after  the  new  investments.  Both  governments  had 
expanded  their  participation  in  the  electricity  sector, through  new  laws  and  agencies;  however,  US  capital 
still had an important share in the project of the Brazilian government, while it was distant to the Argentine 
project.  The  trajectory  of  American  &  Foreign  Power  in  both  countries  depended  on  the  relationship 
between  national  governments  and  international  companies,  mediated  by  the  very  active  American 
diplomacy throughout the decade.55

b)  The end of an era: Expropriations in Argentina and Brazil. 
The fate of the Argentine holdings was clear by the end of the 1940s. In 1944-46, American & Foreign 
Power  had  brought  suits  in  the  provincial  courts,  claiming  that  subsidiaries  had  been  deprived  of  current 
incomes  and  compensations  were  inadequate.  The  appeals  reached  the  Supreme  Court,  which  in  1946 
rejected  them,  on  the  grounds  that  the  concessionaries  were  part  of  a  system  of  holding  companies. 
Subsequently, American & Foreign Power stop investing in Argentina and proposed a deal to sell the all its 
properties to the Argentinean government. 56  

The  regulation  strategies  applied  by  the  military  government  continued  during  the  administration  of 
Juan Domingo Perón (1946-52). The electrification project was included in the First Five-Year Plan, which 
proposed developing hydroelectric potential, expanding the generating capacity, coordinating energy policy 
between  the  federal,  provincial,  and  local  authorities,  and  assuming  direct  management of  electric  utilities 
when  needed.  To  this  end,  the  state  would  build  12  thermal  power  plants  and  47  hydroelectric  plants,  a 
planned  investment  of  US  $417.5  million  along  15  years.57  By  1951,  the  National  Energy  Company,  and 
state-owned  company  which  replaced  the  former  agency,  administrated  51  plants,  with  a  total  capacity  of 
83,643 kw.58 

Competition  with  state-owned  plants  was  seen  by  American  &  Foreign  Power  as  a  further  problem. 
According  to  the  company  reports,  the  expansion  of  energy  sales  in  Argentina  would  not  compensate  for 
losses  caused  by  the  expropriation  of  plants  in  Santa  Fe  and  Cordoba.59  Incomes  from  non-expropriated 
subsidiaries did no more than cover operating costs, since rates had been frozen until 1949.  Moreover, the 
1949  Constitution  provided  for  acquisition  of  public  services  by  the  State  either  by  purchase  or 
expropriation;  subsequently,  the  company  again  proposed to  sell  all  its  assets  to the  Government.  60  From 
1950 on, the US subsidiaries in Argentina faced deficits. 

Negotiations moved forward in 1953, when the Argentine government ‘announced the enactment of a 
new foreign investment law providing for improved foreign Exchange treatment for new foreign investments 
in that country’.  61 Nevertheless, both parties did not reach an agreement until the administration of Arturo 
Frondizi in 1958, when a cooperation program between US companies and the Argentine state oil company 
Yacimientos  Petrolíferos  Fiscales  (YPF)  was  launched.  According  to  it,  all  the  subsidiaries  would  be 
transferred  to  the  government,  and  their  assets  would  be  valued  by  the  Supreme  Court,  and  four  experts 
appointed by the executive branch, the IBRD, the Chief Justice and the American & Foreign Power.62 A year 
later, American & Foreign Power transferred its properties to the Argentinean government, which paid US 
$2.250 million and agreed to cancel the remaining amount of US $2.457 in 15 years.   

In Brazil, on the other hand, optimistic business expectations prevailed until 1958. The report of 1956 
celebrated  the  Juscelino  Kubitschek  government’s  Target  Plan,  aimed  to  develop  the  country’s 
infrastructure.63  Kubitschek’s  economic  policy  facilitated  the  entry  of  foreign  capital,  showing  a  strong 
interest  in  developing  the  Brazilian  energy  sector.64  Hence,  in  1956,  the  US  group  proposed  a  five-year 
project to expand electricity generation, which would cost US $250 million, increasing the installed capacity

in  421,500  kW.65  At  that time,  American  &  Foreign  Power’s  investments  in  Brazil  accounted  for 38.8per 
cent of its total investments.66 

In the second half of the 1950s, American & Foreign Power remained the second largest company in 
the  country,  but  it  soon  came  to  a  turning  point:  increasing  incomes  were  consumed  by  the  increase  of 
general expenses.67 According to the perception of the company’s directors, profits were less than expected, 
as consequence of currency devaluation and Brazilian legislation and new domestic and foreign investments 
were required to maintain business growth.68 

Even  though  the  company  provided  electricity  services  throughout  most  of  Brazil,  in  1959,  the 
government of Rio Grande do Sul expropriated Companhia de Energia Elétrica Rio-Grandense. The conflict 
was  caused  by  the  nationalist  leanings  of  the  state  governor  who,  questioning  the  services  of  the  US 
company,  took  over  the  subsidiary  for  the  amount  of  1  cruzeiro!.69  The  case  was  appealed  to  the  federal 
government  but  saw  no  definite  solution.  In  1962,  new  disputes  emerged  in  the  city  of  Recife.  The  local 
government claimed that the company’s assets should be reverted to the government of Pernambuco at the 
end  of  the  concession.  From  the  company  point  of  view,  even  if  the  expropriations  were  reversed  by  the 
Federal  government,  the  uncertainty  would  continue  to  persist.  Moreover,  at that  time  the  company  faced 
significant losses abroad, especially those resulting from the 1959 Cuban revolution. Its strategy thus was to 
rapidly withdraw from remaining concessions, and minimised losses as far as possible. 

Seeking  support  from  the  US  government,  American  &  Foreign  Power  alleged  that  it  suffered 
considerable losses—as had happened in Cuba, with expropriations amounting to US $153 million—and it 
needed to reduce the risk of further expropriations, as seemed likely to occur in Brazil. Company’s director 
requested the government to sell eleven electric utilities, as it had done in Mexico, taking advantage of the 
fact  that  the  João  Goulart  administration  (1961-64),  was  undergoing  serious  financial  difficulties,  thereby 
requiring US  financial support.70 President Goulart wanted to roll over existing debts with the US,71 so the 
US government conditioned the success of negotiations to an agreement with American & Foreign Power. In 
fact, the  US  company  requests  were  not  solved  during  the  Goulart  administration,  which  fell  to  a military 
coup  in  1964.  The  report  for  the  sale  of  American  &  Foreign  Power’s  subsidiaries  was  presented  by  the 
Scandinavian  Engineering  Corporation,72  which  was  responsible  for  placing  them  under  government  trust, 
and  signed  the  agreements  for  the  expropriation  on  November  12,  1964.  Company’s  assets  were  to  be 
transferred to the newly formed state-owned company Eletrobras, and their valuation proved to be a victory 
for the  interests of the US  holding company. The 1960s therefore  marked the end of  American  &  Foreign 
Power’s  involvement  in  Latin  American  electricity  companies.  Despite  their  divergent  trajectories, 
Argentina  and  Brazil  seem  to  have  typified  an  era  of  US  investments  in  the  electricity  sector  in  Latin 
America.

 Concluding Remarks 

American  &  Foreign  Power’s  trajectory  reveals  the  fluctuant  trend  of  US  direct  investment  in  Latin 
America.  Early  company's  goals,  aimed  at  reorganising  and  centralising  administrative,  technical,  and

financial  management  of  Latin  American  subsidiaries,  were  only  partially  achieved.  The  revision  of  the 
concessions  in  order  to  homogenise  the  legal  status  of  utility  companies  in  different  provinces  and 
municipalities  failed. Despite  some progress  in restructuring the organisation of subsidiaries’  s capital and 
the  implementation  of  modern  accounting  methods,  plans  for  financial  organisation  and  technical 
modernisation  of  power  plants  and  distribution  networks,  were  slowed  by  the  prevailing  crisis  of  the 
financing style for funding huge investments in public utilities, which relied on international capital markets 
before 1930. 

The  crisis  of  1930  marked  the  end  of  public  financing  of  electric  utilities;  thereafter,  public  utility 
holding companies consolidated their dependence on the controlling parent company  by  increasing debt at 
high  interest  rates.  At  the  same  time,  the  end  of  the  gold  standard,  followed  by  the  devaluation  of  Latin 
American  currencies,  increased  the  companies’  financial  costs  until  1940.  During  the  first  decade  of 
operations,  operating  incomes  increased  together  with  the  expansion  of  the  Argentinean  and  Brazilian 
economies; however, financial losses push profits in US dollars down. In the second post-war, a new form of 
financing  based  on  international  bank  loans  began  to  emerge  while  national  governments  broadened  their 
participation  in  the  electric  power  sector  with  plans  for  electrification  and  regional  integration.  The 
availability of capital to modernise electricity systems renewed the business expectations of success. In that 
context,  the  Brazilian  subsidiaries  of  American  &  Foreign  Power  increased  their  generating  capacity  and 
extended their systems, obtaining higher incomes. However, fluctuating exchange rates and price inflation in 
Brazil, reduced the earnings in dollars as of 1954. 

In  contrast  to  Brazil,  American  &  Foreign  Power  never  made  its  planned  investments  in  Argentina. 
The poor quality of the services and the insufficient electricity supply, paved the way to the expropriation of 
several  plants  in  1943-48.  Tense  relations  between  the  US  State  Department  and  Argentina’s  military 
government hindered any negotiations between the two parts until 1946 when the company decided to sell 
its  properties  in  Argentina.  The  claim  for  adequate  compensations  remained  unsolved  for  more  than  a 
decade,  as  the  conflict  arising  from  the  expropriations  lasted  through  the  Peronist  administration  and 
continued with the military government who overthrew Peron in 1955. As a result from these controversial 
relations, Argentina did not get international funding until the end of 1950s, and the generating capacity of 
Argentinean electricity system increased slower than it did in other Latin American countries. 

In  the  late  1950s,  the  leading  role  of  Latin  American  governments  in  electricity  systems,  which 
included the confiscation of American & Foreign Power properties in Cuba and the subsequent expropriation 
of some of their subsidiaries in Brazil, in addition with the current losses from the exchange rate, grounded 
the firm’s decision to withdraw from the region. The company sold its properties to the Mexican government 
and  signed  an  agreement  with  the  Argentine  government  to  pay  off  the  debt  of  expropriated  companies, 
transferring the remaining assets to the state-owned electricity enterprise.  

Overall,  we  conclude  that  in  the  long  run  American  &  Foreign  Power’s  revenues  fluctuated 
substantially,  and  that  the  average  performance  was  no  entirely  satisfactory.  Business  performance  was 
greatly  affected  by  changes  in  the  international  financing  conditions  and  in  the  regulatory  framework, 
moving from concession contracts to discretionary regulation. Nevertheless, the main reason to explain the 
poor  performance  of  this  American  company  was  its  late  entry  into  a  market  controlled  by  European  and 
Canadian holding companies, which had been operating electricity companies in more developed areas since 
the end of the nineteenth century. From 1930 to the second post-war, American & Foreign Power followed a 
venture capital investment strategy: its investments were reduced to minimum and technology transfer was 
low. Therefore, the systems managed by this company hardly increased the generating capacity of its plants 
and they did not benefit from economies of scale. As the payment of loans interests was the top priority, the 
development  of  the  electric  power  systems  actually  depended  on  the  investments  made  by  the  former 
companies  in  Argentina  and  Brazil.  Previous  investment  patterns  determined  the  different  trajectories  of 

 

17 

American  & Foreign Power’s subsidiaries  in the  interwar period, which certainly  influenced  business-state 
relations as of the end of the Second World War. 

This article reviewed the performance and strategies of American & Foreign Power in Argentina and 
Brazil,  demonstrating  that  the  interests  of  its  parent  company,  Electric  Bond  &  Share,  hindered  the 
expansion of low-cost and high-quality electricity services to Latin American consumers before the second 
post-war.  In  this  sense,  national  governments  seeking  to  intervene  in  the  potential  conflicts  between 
companies and consumers, began to discuss the extent of foreign ownership and control of electric utilities. 
The  analysis  of  these  conflicts  in  Argentina  and  Brazil,  also  highlights  how  discussions  between  the 
company and both governments were not confined to business issues but encompassed diplomatic efforts as 
the financing of new ventures was conditioned upon solving the problem of expropriations posed by the US 
government.
