Abstract 
This paper proposes extensions of the idea of shared prosperity and inclusive development. It 
explores dynamic growth linkages between mean income, inequality and social welfare, on the 
one hand, and different labor ingredients and income sources, on the other. We propose a new 
decomposition method that quantifies the contributions to the shared growth patterns observed 
of  social  policies  such  as  education,  social  security  benefits,  BPC  and  Bolsa  Família  and  of 
classic  labor  market  performance  such  as  unemployment  and  participation  rates,  returns  to 
schooling,  hourly  wages  and  hours  worked.  The  paper  also  extends  the  idea  of  shared 
prosperity  to  shared  opportunities  that  leads  to  new  measures  of  inequity  in  opportunities. 
These can be calculated from household surveys that provide information on individuals’ access 
to  various  basic  services  in  education,  health,  living  conditions  and  so  on.    The  proposed 
methodologies  are  applied  to  the  Brazilian  National  Household  Survey  (PNAD)  covering  the 
period  2001-2012.  Many  policy  questions  relating  to  labor  market  performance  and  social 
policies  are  explored  in  explaining  how  Brazil  achieved  shared  growth  since  the  dawn  of  the 
new millennium.

Resumo 
Este  artigo  propõe  extensões  da  ideia  de  prosperidade  compartilhada  e  desenvolvimento 
inclusivo.  Ele  explora  ligações  tanto  do  nível  como  do  crescimento  entre  renda  média, 
desigualdade e bem-estar social, de um lado, e diferentes ingredientes trabalhistas e fontes de 
renda, por outro. Propomos um novo método de decomposição que quantifica as contribuições 
para  os  padrões  de  crescimento  compartilhado  observados  de  políticas  sociais  como 
educação, previdência social, BPC e Bolsa Família, e do desempenho no mercado de trabalho, 
medido  pelo  desemprego  e  taxas  de  participação,  retornos  da  educação,  salários  por  hora  e 
horas  trabalhadas.  O  artigo  também  estende  a  ideia  de  prosperidade  compartilhada  para  a 
ideia  de  oportunidades  compartilhadas  que  levam  a  novas  medidas  de  desigualdade  de 
oportunidades.  Estas  podem  ser  calculadas  a  partir  de  pesquisas  domiciliares  que  fornecem 
informações  sobre  o  acesso  dos  indivíduos  a  vários  serviços  básicos  de  educação,  saúde, 
condições  de  vida  e  assim  por  diante.  As  metodologias  propostas  são  aplicadas  à  Pesquisa 
Nacional  por  Amostra  de  Domicílios  (PNAD)  cobrindo  o  período  de  2001  a  2012.  Muitas 
questões políticas relacionadas ao desempenho do mercado de trabalho e políticas sociais são 
exploradas  ao  analisar  como  o  Brasil  alcançou  um  crescimento  compartilhado  desde  o 
alvorecer do novo milênio.

Introduction 
 

Inclusive  growth  is  a  new  development  paradigm  that  has  been  widely  discussed  among 
governments,  international  organizations  and  other  stakeholders  in  recent  years.  At  this 
juncture,  several  countries  in  Asia  are  shifting  their  development  goals  from  just  poverty 
reduction  toward  other  social  objectives.  For  instance,  India  has  focused  on  inclusive  growth, 
while  China  has  talked  about  creating  a  harmonious  society.  Similarly,  Thailand  has 
emphasized  growth  combined  with  equity.  While  it  is  unclear  how  these  concepts  precisely 
differ from one another, it is widely accepted that they are related to inclusive growth.  
 
Policy makers and experts have yet to formulate and agree on a single, cohesive definition of 
inclusive  growth.  Various  organizations  have  in  fact  adopted  their  own  definitions  of  inclusive 
growth.  The  Indian  Planning  Commission’s  definition  is  the  most  comprehensive  –  defining 
inclusive growth as growth that alleviates poverty, generates employment, promotes equality of 
opportunities  particularly  in  terms  of  access  to  health  and  education,  fosters  empowerment 
through formal schooling and skills development, encourages environmental sustainability, good 
governance and recognizes the role of women. 
 
With poverty reduction as the main social objective, the Indian Planning Commission’s definition 
expects inclusive growth to achieve many goals. Inequality reduction as a social objective is not 
covered  in  this  definition  but  there  is  a  concern  for  inequality  of  opportunities.  Thus,  this 
definition is a mixture of social objectives and policies that would achieve such objectives. The 
focus  is  on  creating  employment  opportunities  and  empowerment  through  education  and  skill 
development.  Under  this  definition,  rapid  economic  growth  is  not  seen  as  the  key  driver  of 
poverty reduction.  
 
Meanwhile,  the  World  Bank  defines  inclusive  growth  as  growth  that  is  sustained  and  broad 
based  –  reduces  poverty  and  generates  employment  rather  than  merely  supporting  income 
redistribution.  Like 
the  World  Bank’s 
characterization of inclusive growth involves poverty reduction as the main social objective. The 
inclusiveness  of  growth  hinges  on  the  adoption  of  certain  policies,  particularly  those  geared 
toward creating productive employment to achieve poverty reduction. However, there are many 
other  policies  that  can  be  implemented  to  reduce  poverty.  Thus,  it  may  not  be  beneficial  to 
restrict the policy space to only the generation of productive employment. There could be many 
poor  who  are  not  in  the  labor  force  such  as  elderly  and  disabled  for  whom  the  employment 
nexus  is  of  little  relevance.  Furthermore,  the  focus  on  productive  employment  may  result  in  a 
high level of unemployment among the poor, which may in turn increase poverty. 
 
World Bank has more recently proposed a new development model that focuses on the bottom 
40%  of  the  population.  Under  this  new  paradigm,  it  aims  to:  (i)  lower  extreme  or  absolute 
poverty in the world to 3% by 2030 and (ii) foster economic growth that benefits the bottom 40% 
of  the  population  (Rosenblatt  and  McGavock,  2013).  The  second  goal  of  targeting  the  bottom 
40%  of  the  population  is  built  on  the  concept  of  shared  prosperity.  Growth  fosters  shared 
prosperity if the bottom 40% of the population could benefit from economic growth.   
 
The idea of shared prosperity appeals to various stakeholders because it has a well-defined but 
simple  social  welfare function.  It  is  closely  related  to  the  notion  of  inclusive  growth  because  it 
ensures that the bottom part of the population can participate in and benefit from growth. 
 
This paper proposes many extensions of shared prosperity that explore linkages between four 
dimensions:  growth  patterns,  inequality,  labor  market  performance  and  social  policies.  The 
paper demonstrates that the simple idea of shared prosperity is a powerful tool to answer many 

Indian  Planning  Commission’s  definition, 

the 

 

2 

policy  questions  relating  to  labor  market  and  social  policies.  The  distinction  is  made  between 
average prosperity (AP) and shared prosperity (SP), which are linked by an inequity component 
on top of the average prosperity measure. Thus following Kolm (1976a, 1976b), two measures 
of  inequity  are  proposed:  (i)  relative  or  rightist  measure  of  inequity  and  (ii)  absolute  or  leftist 
measure  of  inequity.  This  study  also  develops  a  related  idea  of  shared  growth,  which  is 
measured  by  gain  or  loss  in  growth  rate  due  to  increasing  (decreasing)  equity  in  shared 
prosperity so the larger the gain, the greater the shared growth. 
 
The  main  methodological  contribution  of  this  paper  is  the  new  decomposition  method  that 
quantifies  the  contributions  of  social  policies  and  labor  market  performance  to  the  shared 
growth. The paper also extends the idea of shared prosperity to shared opportunities that leads 
to  a  new  measure  of  inequity  in  opportunities.  This  new  measure  can  be  calculated  from 
household  surveys  that  provide  information  on  individuals’  access  to  various  basic  services  in 
education, health, living conditions and so on.   
 
The  proposed  methodologies  are  applied  to  the  Brazilian  National  Household  Survey  (PNAD) 
covering the period 2001-2012. Many policy questions relating to labor market performance and 
social policies have been explored in explaining how Brazil achieved shared growth during past 
decade of 2001-2012.  
 
The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Sections  2  and  3  propose  simple  indicators  of  shared 
prosperity  in  levels  and  in  growth  rates,  respectively.  Section  4  measures  the  contributions  of 
mean income and inequality to share prosperity levels. Section 5 implements the same analysis 
of the previous section to understand the immediate determinants of shared growth dynamics. 
Section  6  sets  the  stage  to  understand  the  role  played  by  different  income  sources  in  shared 
prosperity  determination  in  the  next  two  sections.  Section  7  calculates  on  a  yearly  basis  the 
contributions  of  labor  income  and  social  policies  such  as  social  security  benefits,  BPC  and 
Bolsa  Família  on  shared  growth  and  its  immediate  determinants.  Section  8  digs  one  level 
further into the labor market determinants of shared growth. It incorporates classic labor market 
ingredients  such  as  unemployment  and  participation  rates,  hours  worked  and  hourly  wages. 
Then  the  impacts  on  hourly  wages  of  changes  in  education  levels  and  their  returns  are 
measured,  which  may  help  to  understand  policies  geared  towards  labor  productivity  growth  in 
different  parts  of  the  income  distribution.  Section  9  proposes  and  applies  a  new  measure  of 
inequality  of  opportunities  including  productive  employment,  education  attainment  and  school 
attendance. The last section provides the main conclusions of the paper.

A Simple Indicator of Shared Prosperity 
 

 
 

                             

Suppose x is the income of an individual which is a random variable with density function  f(x), 
then mean income of the population is defined as  
 
             
 
This  is  a  simple  measure  of  average  standard  of  living  enjoyed  by  the  population.  Although 
most  economists  focus  on  per  capita  GDP  as  a  measure  of  country’s  prosperity,  it  has  many 
limitations  in  providing  an  adequate  measure  of  people’s  average  welfare.  In  their  book  “Mis-
Measuring our Lives: Why GDP Doesn’t Add up?”, Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul 
Fitoussi  (2010)  have  eloquently  explained  why  GDP  may  provide  a  misleading  measure  of 

      (1)

welfare. Given such limitations, the mean income defined in (1) can be suggested as a measure 
of average prosperity (AP) of the society.  
 
The World Bank is now promoting the idea of shared prosperity (SP), which is simply the mean 
of the bottom 40% of the population. More formally, suppose z is the income defined by 
 
              
 
then the shared prosperity indicator is defined by  

     

 
 

    

 
         
 
 
        
 

            

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

      (2) 

 
which  shows  that  the shared prosperity  indicator  is  a  weighted  average  of  individual  incomes. 
This  is  the  welfare  measure  proposed  by  Basu  (2001)  that focuses  on  the bottom  20%  of  the 
population.  World  Bank’s  new  development  model  on  the  other  hand  focuses  on  the  bottom 
40%  of  the  population.  The  idea  of  shared  prosperity  is  based  on  the  notion  that  a  large 
proportion of the population should take part in and benefit from the growth process.  
 
The SP indicator is like other measures of social welfare defined over individual incomes such 
as  Atkinson’s  (1970) and  Sen’s  (1973),  so  it has  an  implicit  inequality  measure,  which  can  be 
defined as 
 
       

                     

      (3) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

      (4) 

 
Then the SP indicator can be written as  
 
                         
 
which  is  a  similar  form  of  social  welfare  functions  defined  over  the  income  space  such  as 
Atkinson’s and Sen’s indexes. Note that   is not a usual measure of inequality such as the Gini 
index because it does not satisfy the weak transfer axiom. It will be referred to as a measure of 
inequity in shared prosperity and (1- ) as a measure of equity in shared prosperity.  
 
   is  an  mean  independent  measure  of  equity,  which  implies  that  the  value  of  the  measure 
remains unchanged if each income is altered by the same proportion. Such measures according 
to  Kolm  (1976a,  1976b)  are  called  the  relative  or  rightist  measures  of  inequality.  Alternatively, 
Kolm  has  proposed  the  absolute  or  leftists  measures  of  inequality,  which  do  not  indicate  any 
change in inequality  when each income is increased or decreased by the same amount.  The 
absolute measure of inequity implicit in the SP social welfare function is defined as  
 
                   
 
The absolute inequity measure A reflects the absolute differences in levels of living rather than 
relative differences.

Shared Growth 
 

The idea of shared growth is now developed. To do so write (4) as

which on taking the first difference gives  
 
                       
 
where                is  the  growth  rate  of  shared  prosperity,              is  the  growth  rate  of 
average prosperity and                 is the growth rate of equity in shared prosperity,  which 
will  be  positive  (negative)  if  equity  in  shared  prosperity  is  increasing  (decreasing). Thus,  there 
will be a gain (loss) in growth rate when equity is improving (deteriorating).  
 
For  instance  if      =6%  and     =4%,  it  means  that  there  is  a  gain  of  2%  in  the  growth  rate  of 
shared  prosperity  entirely  attributed  to  the  improvement  of  equity.  The  gain  in  growth  rate 
signifies that economic growth is providing greater benefits to the bottom 40% population than 
the  average  gain  to  the  society.  This  motivates  the  idea  of  shared  growth,  which  can  be 
measured  by  the  gain  in  growth  rate  due  to  increasing  equity  in  shared  prosperity  so  that  the 
larger the gain, the greater is the shared growth.    
 
  4. Patterns of Shared Prosperity in Brazil 
 
This section provides trends in average and shared prosperity in Brazil from 2001 to 2012. The 
nationwide  survey  called  PNAD  is  utilized  in  the  empirical  analysis.  This  is  an  annual  survey 
conducted  by  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics  (Instituto  Brasileiro  de 
Geografia  e  Estatística  -  IBGE)  since  1967.  Real  per  capita  household  income  is  used  as 
individuals’  welfare  measure.  Real  per  capita  income  is  defined  as  per  capita  nominal  income 
adjusted for prices. The consumer price indexes corresponding to the PNAD survey periods are 
used to adjust for prices. 
  
Table 1 presents the estimates of average and shared prosperity in Brazil. Both AP and SP are 
measured in money metric (R$ per year in 2012 prices). The trends show that both AP and SP 
have  been  consistently  increasing  but  the  absolute  gap  between  the  two  has  also  been 
widening.  The  trend  growth  rates  presented  in  the  last  row  of  the  table  indicates  that  AP  has 
been increasing at an annual rate of R$309 per person while SP has been increasing only at an 
annual rate of R$131 per person. In terms of absolute living standards, the bottom 40% of the 
population has thus performed worse than the average population; the gap between the two has 
been widening at an annual rate of R$177 per person. Absolute inequality, which is defined as 
the difference between AP and SP, has widened between 2001 and 2012.   
 
The  inequality  measure  developed  in  (3)  is  the  relative  measure  of  inequality.  The  trend 
depicted  shows  that  relative  inequality  in  Brazil  has  been  consistently  declining from  79.5%  in 
2001  to  72.2%  in  2012,  representing  a  sharp  decline  of  0.66  percentage  points  annually.  The 
trend  growth  rate  in  relative  inequity  has  been  sharply  declining  at  an  annual  rate  of  0.66 
percentage  points.  Thus,  the  relative  gap  in  shared  prosperity  has  been  declining.  This 
conclusion is also consistent with the declining Gini index in the same period.    
 
Absolute  inequality  measures  reflect  the  absolute  differences  in  levels  of  living  rather  than 
relative  differences.  In  Brazil,  absolute  inequality  is  increasing  but  relative  inequality  is 
decreasing. This situation can be intuitively explained by the following illustration.  
 
Consider  an  economy  composed  of  just  two  households  with  incomes  $1,000  and  $10,000. 
Suppose  the  poor  household’s  income  is  increased  three  fold  while  the  rich  household’s  is 
scaled up two fold. Although relative inequality has decreased, the absolute difference in their 
incomes  has  sharply  increased  from  $9,000  to  $17,000.  As  such,  relative  inequality  has 
decreased but absolute inequality has sharply risen. 

 

5 

 
The concept of absolute inequity may have much intuitive appeal but in almost all debates  on 
inequality the focus is always on the relative concept of inequality. In Brazil, the political debate 
on inequality is largely based on the Gini index, which is a relative measure of inequality.  
In layman’s language, the reference to the increasing gap between the rich and the poor may 
most  likely  mean  the  absolute  difference  between  the  rich  and  the  poor.  Which  of  the  two 
concepts should be adopted to evaluate alternative policies? As Ravallion (2004) points, there 
is  no  economic  theory  that  tells  us  that  inequality  is  relative,  not  absolute.  It  is  not  that  one 
concept is right and one is wrong but they are two different concepts.

Shared Growth in Brazil 

Table 2 presents the annual growth rates of AP and SP. The growth trends presented show that 
growth  rates  of  SP  are  higher  than  that  of  AP  throughout  2001-2012.  This  implies  that  the 
bottom  40%  of  the  population  has  performed  consistently  better  than  the  average.  The  last 
column  in  Table  2  is  obtained  by  subtracting  the  growth  rates  of  AP  from  SP.  The  gains  in 
growth rates measure the extent to which growth in mean income is shared. The larger is the 
gain the greater the shared growth. Substantial gains in growth rates are noticeable throughout 
the decade of 2001-2012.  
 
The last row in Table 2 gives the trend growth rates in 2001-2012. AP has been increasing at an 
annual  rate  of  3.64%  but  the  shared  prosperity  has  been  increasing  at  annual  rate  of  6.37%, 
resulting  in  an  annual  gain  in  growth  rate  of  2.73%.  This  growth  pattern  signifies  an 
unprecedented reduction in inequality in the given period. Thus, average prosperity in Brazil has 
been  increasing  and  more  importantly  the  rate  of  this  increase  in  prosperity  has  been  much 
higher among the bottom 40% population. Thus, it can be unambiguously concluded that Brazil 
has  sustained  shared growth  in  the  standard  of  living  of  its  population. What are factors  have 
contributed to Brazil’s success? This issue is explored in the next section.

Determinants of Shared Prosperity 

Brazil has been able to achieve an impressive improvement in both average and shared 
prosperity. In order to sustain this improvement, it is important to determine the factors that 
have contributed to this success. This section identifies these factors and measures the 
magnitudes of their impact on shared prosperity.  
 
Households generate income from many sources. Labor is the primary source of income - 
generated by family members who are employed in the labor market. Who is employed in the 
family and how much income is generated by those employed is determined by a complex set 
of households’ demographic characteristics. In addition to labor income, households derive 
income from other sources such as public and private transfers and financial assets, etc. This 
section measures the direct impact of these different factors that contribute to shared prosperity.  
 
Suppose households draw their income from k sources or there are k mutually exclusive income 
components and vi(x) is the income from the ith source of a household with total per capita 
income x such that  
 
           
 
then the mean of the ith income source is given by 
 
                  
 
then substituting (7) into (8) gives 
 
        
 
This equation can be used to estimate the contributions of each income source (component) to 
average prosperity. The term            is the percent contribution of the ith income source to 
the total average prosperity. 
 
Similarly  we  can  calculate  the  mean  of  the  ith  income  source  for  the  bottom  40%  of  the 
population:

Substituting (7) into (10) gives

    (11) 

 
          
 
This  equation  provides  the  contribution  of  each  income  component  to  total  shared  prosperity. 
Thus, the term              is the percent contribution of the ith income source to total shared 
prosperity. 
 
Policy  making  will  benefit  from  determining  which  income  sources  contribute  to  shared 
prosperity  and  by  how  much.  An  income  source  can  be  said  pro-  shared-prosperity  if  it 
contributes more to the per capita income of the bottom 40% of the population than to the per 
capita income of the whole society. This motivates us to propose a new index: 
 
    
 
If    is greater than 1, this implies that the ith income source contributes more to the per capita 
income  of  the  bottom  40%  population  and  thus      will  be  called  as  the  pro-shared  prosperity 
index (PSPI). This index is like a targeting index informing how well a particular income source 
is targeted to the bottom 40% of the population.  
 
What  are  the  sources  of  inequity  in  SP?  To  answer  this  question,  we  can  use  the  following 
decompositions for the relative and absolute inequity: 
 
                  
 
and  
 
                
 
The term                    is the percent contribution of the ith income source to total relative 
inequity. Similarly,                  is the percent contribution of the ith income to total absolute 
inequity.

Determinants of Shared Prosperity in Brazil from 2001 to 2012  

 
The following income sources are considered in explaining the shared prosperity in Brazil: 

a.  Labor income 
b.  Bolsa Família Program (BFP) 
c.  Continuous Cash Benefit (Beneficio de Prestação Continuada - BPC) 
d.  Social Security 
e.  Other incomes 

 

Labor income includes all earnings from employment by all household members. A household’s 
labor  income  depends  on  two  main  factors:  (i)  number  of  household  members  who  are 
employed  and  (ii)  the  level  of  earnings  of  working  individuals.  The  next  section  provides  a 
detailed discussion of the linkage between labor earnings and labor market characteristics. 
 
Until  2003,  Brazil  had  implemented  four  major  cash  transfer  programs  (i)  Bolsa  Escola;  (ii) 
Fome  Zero;    (iii)  Bolsa  Alimentação;  and  (iv)  Vale  Gás.  Bolsa  Escola  is  an  income  grant  for 
primary  education.  Fome  Zero  and  Bolsa  Alimentação  provide  income  grants  related  to  food 
security  while  Vale  Gás  provides  subsidies  to  help  poor  households  buy  cooking  gas.  Bolsa 
Família  Program  took  shape  in  2003,  early  in  the  first  term  of  Brazilian  President  Luiz  Inácio 

 

8 

Lula da Silva. It was established out of a merger of these four major cash transfer programs. It 
has now become a popular program benefiting more than 50 million people.  
 
The  BPC  is  an  unconditional  disability  and  old  age  grant  targeted  at  the  poor.    It  is  a  non-
contributory social assistance program entirely comprised of a subsidy to the beneficiaries.  
 
Social security is the main component of social income in Brazil second only to labor earnings 
among all other sources collected by PNAD. The major portion of benefits is made of transfers 
that are to some degree linked with past contributions. Still the beneficiaries of social security do 
get public subsidies because the volume of transfers exceeds the volume of contributions.  
 
Other incomes include various types of non-social incomes to which the government does not 
make any contribution. They include private  transfers from other families and non-government 
organizations,  private  pensions,  rents  and  other  earnings  from  assets  such  as  interests  and 
dividends.  
 
Table  3  presents  the  percentage  contributions  of  different  income  sources  to  total  shared 
prosperity. Labor income is the most dominant factor shaping shared prosperity. In 2001, labor 
income alone contributed 79.23% to SP but declined to 72.77% in 2012. Thus, the contribution 
of labor income has been declining at an annual rate 0.53 percentage points.  
 
Meanwhile,  the  contribution  of  non-labor  income  has  been  increasing  at  an  annual  of  0.47 
percentage  points.  The  contribution  of  the  Bolsa  Família  Program  (BFP)  to  the  total  SP 
increased  from  0.67%  in  2001  to  7.08%  in  2012  –  indicating  an  annual  increase  of  0.52 
percentage  points. The  contribution  of  BPC  has  also  increased  but  at  a  slower  annual  rate of 
0.16 percentage points. The contribution of social security has remained stable at about 15%. 
While  the  contributions  of  social  income  have  increased,  non-social  incomes  have  seen  a 
declining trend in their contributions.

As  noted  earlier,  relative  inequity  in  Brazil  has  been  sharply  declining  over  the  2001-2012 
period.  Total  inequity  in  2001  was  79.52%  which  declined  to  72.25%  in  2012,  declining  at  an 
annual  rate  of  0.66  percentage  points.  Table  4  informs  how  contributions  of  various  income 
sources contributed to the decline. The labor income has been the most dominant factor, which 
has contributed to an annual reduction of 0.40 percentage points. In contrast, BFP - which is the 

 

9 

major  social  program  in  Brazil  -  has  contributed  to  a  reduction  in  inequity  by  only  0.08 
percentage points.  
 
The contribution of BPC is even smaller at only 0.01 percentage points. Similarly, social security 
has had relatively small impact on inequity. It is interesting to note that other non-social incomes 
have contributed to a reduction in inequity by 0.14 percentage points. Thus, the sharp reduction 
in  relative  inequity  that  has  happened  in  Brazil  has  been  contributed  largely  by  non-social 
incomes: labor and other incomes.

Trend 2001-2012 

 

As the data show, social programs do not have a large impact on inequality reduction, which is 
mainly due to the fact that their relative size is small compared to labor and other incomes. This 
does not imply that these programs are not well targeted. To measure their targeting efficiency, 
we can calculate their pro-shared prosperity index (PSPI) derived in (12). Table 5 presents the 
calculations of this index.   
 
The  PSPI  for  the  total  income  is  1,  which  is  the  bench  mark.  An  index  value  greater  than  1 
implies that the particular income source benefits the bottom 40% more than the average. The 
larger  is  the  value  of  the  index,  the  greater  the  targeting  efficiency.  The  PSPI  for  the  labor 
income was 1.02 in 2001, which has declined to 0.94 in 2012. This implies that labor income is 
relatively becoming less well targeted at the bottom 40% of the population. The index value for 
the BFP is around 8, which implies that it has been very effective in targeting the bottom 40% of 
the population and can be deemed as highly pro-shared prosperity.   
 
The value of PSPI for the BPC has been over 3, which suggests that BPC also supports pro-
shared  prosperity  but  its  degree  of  impact  is  much  smaller  than  of  the  BFP.  Social  security, 
which has a large component of public subsidy, has been having the value of PSPI smaller than 
1 throughout the decade and thus cannot said to be well targeted.

Determinants of Shared Growth Trends in Brazil 

Based  on  the  shared  growth  rates  presented  in  Table  2,  it  can  be  concluded  that  Brazil  has 
achieved  a  sustained  shared  growth  in  the  standard  of  living  of  its  population.  What  are  the 
factors that have contributed to the shared growth in Brazil? This section attempts to shed light 
on this topic. 
 
Suppose    is the AP in year t and     is the mean of the ith income component in year t then 
based on (9) we have  
 
          
 
Then it can be shown that

which shows that the growth rate of AP is the weighted average of the growth rates of individual 
income components  - the weights being proportional to the average of income shares in each 
period. This  equation  informs  the  magnitude  of  contribution  of  each  income  component  to  the 
growth  rate  of  AP.  Similarly,  we  can  explain  the  contribution  of  each  income  component  to 
growth rate of SP using  
 
             

             

    (17) 

    
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

        
       

    
   

 

 
where     is the SP in year t and     is the mean of the ith component of the bottom 40% of the 
population  in  year  t.  This  equation  informs  the  magnitude  of  the  contribution  of  each  income 
component  to  the  growth  rate  of  SP.  Shared  growth  is  defined  as  the  gain/loss  in  the  growth 
rate of the SP, which is the difference between the growth rates of SP and AP. The difference of 
growth in (16) from (17) provides the contributions of each income component to shared growth. 
 
From Table 6, it is noted that the AP in Brazil has been increasing at an annual rate of 3.64% 
over  the  2001-2012  period.  The  contribution  of  labor  income  is  2.76%,  which  means  that  the 
labor income has been the dominating factor in enhancing the AP in Brazil. The BFP, which is 
Brazil’s flagship welfare program, has contributed only 0.1% to the AP. The contribution of BPC 
is  even  smaller  at  0.06%.  After  the  labor  income,  social  security  is  the  largest  component 
contributing 0.73% to total growth in the AP.   
 
The SP has been growing at an annual rate of 6.39% leading to a gain of growth rate of 2.74%, 
which  has  resulted  in shared  growth  in  Brazil.  Labor  income  contributing  1.52%  to  the  gain  in 
growth rate has been the major factor that has resulted in substantial shared growth in Brazil. 

 

11 

Furthermore, given the size, the 0.73% contribution of the BFP is notable. This shows that BFP 
is a well-targeted program benefiting the bottom 40% of population more than the average. The 
contribution  of  social  security,  which  attracts  substantial  government  subsidy,  is  only  0.16%, 
which is relatively very small.

The Role of Labor Market In Explaining Shared Growth 
 

Brazil has been enjoying shared growth during the last decade of 2001-2012 largely due to the 
income  generated  in  the  labor  market.  It  is  clearly  important  to  determine  the  factors  in  labor 
market  that  have  resulted  in  shared  growth.  PNAD  provides  labor  force  characteristics  of 
individuals.  The  following  variables,  which  have  direct  impact  on  the  growth  rate  of  labor 
income, have been identified.    
    

1.  Employment rate: Employed persons as the share of labor force: e 
2.  Hours worked per employed persons: h 
3.  Labor  force  participation  rate:  Employed  and  unemployed  persons  as  share  of  the 

population: l 

4.  Labor productivity: Labor income earned per hour of work: p=y/h 

 
The linkage between growth rate of per capita labor income and growth rates of the four labor 
force characteristics is provided through the following identity: 
 
                                      
 
where y is the labor income per person.  Using this identity, it is easy to show that the growth 
rate of per capita labor income is a sum of the growth rates of four labor force characteristics: 
 
                                     
 
The  first  factor  is  the  employment  rate.  Growth  in  employment  rate  positively  contributes  to 
growth in per capita labor income. A similar interpretation is given to the other factors.  
 
Schooling  is  a  major  factor  that  influences  productivity.  It  is  generally  true  that  the  higher  the 
level  of  schooling  an  individual  possesses,  the  greater  is  his  or  her  productivity.  Thus,  an 
increase  in  years  of  schooling  should  lead  to  an  increase  in  productivity.  However,  the 
relationship  between  the  two  is  not  simple.  Changes  in  years  of  schooling  are  also 
accompanied  by  changes  in  returns  from  schooling.  The  average  hourly  return  of  one  year  of 
schooling is given by 
 

    (18) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

   

 

 

     

 
where S is the mean years of schooling. Then growth in productivity p can be written as 
 
                          
 
which  shows  that  growth  rate  in  mean  productivity  can  be  decomposed  into  two  components: 
the first  component  is  the  growth  rate  of  average  hourly  rate  of  return from  schooling  and  the 
second is the growth rate of average years of schooling.  The growth of per capita labor income 
is equal to the growth rates of five components given by  
 
                                             
 
which  provides  a  method  of  calculating  the  contributions  of  each  of  the  five  labor  force 
characteristics  to  the  growth  rate  of  average  labor  income.  This  equation  is  derived  for  the 
whole population but a similar equation can be derived for the bottom 40% of the population as 
 
                                                                                               
 
where                              are  per  capita  labor  income,  employment  rate,  average  hours  of 
work, labor force participation rate, average years of schooling and average rate of return from 
schooling for  the  bottom  40% of  the  population,  respectively.  The shared  growth  in  per  capita 
labor income is given by 
             , which can be written as the sum of growth rates of five labor force characteristics:  
 

    (19) 

(20) 

 

 

 

 

                                                                                                  

 
This equation quantifies the contributions of each of the labor force characteristics to the shared 
growth in the labor income.  
 
Table 7 presents the contributions of each of the labor force characteristics to the trend growth 
rates in per capita labor income. Labor income has been growing at an annual rate of 3.61% in 
2001-2012. Of this trend growth rate, an increase in employment has contributed 0.31% to AP – 
not very large but positive nonetheless. Labor force participation rate has also been increasing - 
contributing 0.39% to the growth in labor income.  
 
The  hours  worked  by  employed  persons  have  been  decreasing,  which  has  contributed  to  a 
decline in the growth rate of labor income by 0.27%. The declining hours of work may be due to 
the change in the nature of employment, which is becoming more productive. It is the increase 
in  hourly  productivity  that  is  contributing  3.15%  to  the  growth  in  labor  income.  The  growth  in 
productivity is explained by two factors: (i) expansion of education and (ii) increase in the rate of 
return  from  each  year  of  schooling.  The  completed  years  of  schooling  alone  is  contributing 
2.30%  to  the  growth  in  productivity.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  expansion  of  education  is 
accompanied by an increase in the average return per year of schooling, which has contributed 
0.88% to the growth in total labor income.  
 
Labor  income  for  the  bottom  40%  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of  5.68%,  which  is  predominantly 
explained by the productivity growth of 6.06%. Growth in productivity is explained by expansion 
of  education  and  the  increase  in  return  from  education.  The  completed  years  of  schooling  for 
the bottom 40% of the population increased at an annual rate of 4.26% and at the same time 
their average rate of return from schooling increased at an annual rate of 1.80%. Thus, it can be 

 

13 

concluded that the education has played the key role in the growth of the SP. The increase in 
rate of return from schooling might have been due to the real increases in the minimum wage in 
the 2001-2012 period but we cannot measure its direct impact.

The  last  column  in  Table  7  provides  the  contributions  of  shared  growth  due  to  labor  income. 
Employment  and  labor  force  participation  rates  have  negatively  contributed  to  the  shared 
growth.  The  shared  growth  has  been  largely  contributed  by  the  increase  in  productivity, 
expansion of education services and increasing returns from education. 
 
Table 8 provides the contributions of all factors to the total shared growth in per capita income. 
Total shared growth was 2.74% per annum - of which 1.47% is explained by the expansion of 
education,  0.67%  by  the  increase  in  the  rate  of  return  from  schooling  and  0.73%  by  Bolsa 
Família. Contributions of BPC and social security are relatively small. Increases  in employment 
rate and labor force participation rates have a negative impact on shared growth.

Shared Opportunities   

 

Apart from expanding output, economic growth also creates opportunities in the economy that 
enhance well-being. For instance, growth generates employment, allowing people to earn 
income to be able to consume goods and services. However, these economic opportunities are 

 

14 

not always equally shared by all. The poor generally benefit less from growth due to 
circumstances or market failures that prevent them from availing of these economic 
opportunities.  
 
Economic growth can directly create opportunities through market operations. More importantly, 
however, it generates resources in the form of tax revenues, fees, and fines, which 
governments use to create opportunities, particularly in education, health, housing, and so on. It 
is commonly perceived that governments can formulate policies and programs that facilitate the 
full participation of those who are less well off, ensuring that opportunities created by growth are 
equitably availed across the population. As such, governments play a key role in determining 
the pattern of growth that can result in equitable opportunities.  
 
Suppose o(x) is an opportunity enjoyed by a person with income x, then the average opportunity 
(AO) enjoyed by the society is given by 
 
                
 
This is the average opportunity available, but does not inform how it is shared by the population. 
Similar to the idea of shared prosperity we can define shared opportunity (SO) as 
 

 
 

  

    

 
            
 

 
        
 

 

 
which is the average opportunity enjoyed by the bottom 40% of the population. The inequity in 
opportunity can be defined as  
 

  
 

 

        
 
Then the SO can be written as  
 
               
 
which is similar to Atkinson’s and Sen’s social welfare functions but defined over opportunity 
space.    measures the proportional loss (or gain) in opportunity due to inequity (or equity) and 
therefore can be an indicator of inequity (equity) in opportunity. Note that unlike inequity 
measure   defined in (3), which lies in the range           , this inequity measure    lies in the 
rage               The negative (positive) value implies that that opportunity is inequitable 
(equitable). 
 

9.1 Employment Opportunities  

 

Labor income is generated through employment in the economy. The people who do not have 
opportunity to be employed earn less income and enjoy a lower standard of living. Employment 
itself has an intrinsic value. People who are employed enjoy greater satisfaction in life.  
 
Employment rate is defined as the share of employed persons in the labor force. It informs 
whether or not those who are able and willing to work are able to obtain work. AO in 
employment is the employment rate for the whole society and the SO in employment is the 
average employment rate for the bottom 40% of the population. Table 9 presents the empirical 
results for Brazil.  

 

15 

 
The average employment rate has increased from 90.50% in 2001 to 93.62% in 2012, resulting 
in an improvement in employment rate at an annual rate of 0.29 percentage points. The 
employment rate for the bottom 40% of the population is about 5 percentage points lower, which 
is also improving but at a slower annual rate of 0.17 percentage points. Thus, employment 
opportunities are not equitable. The inequity index in employment has increased from 5.88% in 
2001 to 6.98% in 2012, with trend annual increase of 0.11 percentage points. The absolute gap 
in employment rate between AO and SO has been widening.

Productive Employment   

International  organizations  such  as  the  World  Bank  argue  that  the  inclusiveness  of  growth 
hinges on poverty reduction policies particularly geared toward creating productive employment. 
Although  productive  employment  generation  has  been  widely  discussed  among  governments, 
international organizations and other stakeholders in recent years, policies to create productive 
employment  have  yet  to  be  clearly  articulated.  To  ensure  the  generation  of  productive 
employment,  Brazil  has  however  developed  a  system  of  formal  contracts,  which  provides 
considerable protection to employees, particularly those with low earnings. Still a large number 
of employees, especially those in the informal sector, do not enjoy the opportunity of securing a 
contractual employment. Large inequity still exists as seen in Table 10. 
 
The  percentage  of  employees  with  formal  contract  has  been  low  in  Brazil  at  61.14%  in  2001, 
which increased to 71.25% in 2012; indicating an annual increase of 0.98 percentage points in 
the  2001-2012  period.  In  2001,  the  bottom  40%  of  the  population  had  only  38.05%  of 
employees  with  formal  contract  indicating  a  high  degree  of  inequity.  Fortunately,  inequity  in 
contractual employment has been declining sharply at annual rate of 1.39 percentage points. In 
2012,  52.27%  of  employees  were  working  with  formal  contract  among  the  bottom  40%  of  the 
population.  The  inequity  index  declined  from  37.77%  in  2001  to  26.63%  in  2012.  Thus,  Brazil 
has  made  an  amazing  progress  in  enhancing  productive  employment,  which  has  been  broad 
based with benefits going more to the poorest 40% of the population.

Opportunity in Education Attainment 

Trend 2001-2012

9.3 
 
An index  of educational attainment of a family is defined as the average years of schooling of 
the  occupied  people  in  the  household.  It  has  been  concluded  earlier  that  this  index  of  family 
education  attainment  makes  large  contribution  to  the  household’s  per  capita  labor  income. 
Education  is  an  opportunity  everyone  should  enjoy.  This  section  analyses  the  inequity  in 
education attainment. The results are presented in Table 11. 
 
It is evident that education attainment in Brazil has been rapidly expanding. Completed years of 
schooling  of  the  occupied people  have  on average  increased from  6.64  years  in  2001 to  8.59 
years in 2012, resulting in an annual improvement of 0.17 years. Education attainment for the 
poorest 40% of the population was only 3.84 years in 2001 which indicated a large inequity of 
42.14%. Fortunately, inequity has been declining at an annual rate of 1.29 percentage points.  
 
Although the improvement in education has contributed to large reduction in inequality in Brazil, 
the  high  inequity  in  education  continues  to  exist.  But  Brazil  has  achieved  commendable 
improvement in broadening its education which has benefited the bottom 40% of the population 
more than the average.

9.4    School Attendance  

Brazil’s conditional cash transfer programs are renowned worldwide given their twin objectives: 
(1)  to  alleviate  poverty;  and  (2)  to  improve  school  attendance  of  children  aged  5  years  and 
older.  The  conditionality  of  the  programs  ensures  that  the  children  from  the  poor  families 
acquire  education  so  that  poverty  is  not  passed  on  to  future  generations.  As  these  programs 
have  been operating  for  quite  some  time,  it is  imperative  to  ask:  how  much  inequity  in  school 
attendance does still exist? Empirical results presented in Table 12 provide the answer. 
 
In  2012,  98.28%  of  the  children  in  the  age  group  of  6-14  years  old  were  regularly  attending 
school.  Only  1.72%  of  these  children  did  not  attend  school,  which  may  be  due  to  illness  or 
disability  so  that  school  systems  cannot  be  held  responsible  for  their  non-attendance.  Even 
among  the  bottom  40%  of  the  population,  97.79%  of  the  children  in  this  age  group  attended 
school  in  2012.  The  gap  in  school  attendance  has  been  narrowing  and  there  is  hardly  any 
inequity in school attendance. The only conclusion that emerges is that Brazil offers opportunity 
to almost all children to attend school and get education. This is a commendable achievement. 
The conditional cash transfers may have been contributing to this outstanding success but there 
may have been other factors. Brazil’s education system may be providing quality education and 
inspiring teachers that may be motivating children to attend school.

This section has presented an analysis of shared opportunity for selected components such as 
education and employment. However, the methodology developed here can be applied to a 
wide range of opportunities such as access to health services, water and sanitation, electricity, 
among others.  
 

10. Conclusion 

In the recent years, inclusive growth is a new development paradigm that has been widely 
discussed among different stakeholders. The World Bank has proposed a new development 
model that focuses on the bottom 40% of the population. The idea is built on the concept of 
shared prosperity. Economic growth fosters shared prosperity if the bottom 40% of the 
population could participate in and benefit from it.  

 

18 

Shared prosperity extensions proposed explore dynamic growth linkages between mean 
income, inequality and social welfare, on the one hand, and different labor ingredients and 
income sources, on the other. The paper demonstrates that the Idea of shared prosperity is a 
powerful tool to answer many policy related questions. The distinction is made between average 
prosperity (AP) and shared prosperity (SP), which are linked by inequity. The study also 
develops a related idea of shared growth, which is measured by gain or loss in growth rate due 
to increasing (decreasing) equity in shared prosperity so the larger the gain, the greater the 
shared growth.  

We also propose a new decomposition method that quantifies the contributions to the shared 
growth patterns and its immediate determinants of social policies such as education, social 
security benefits, BPC and Bolsa Família and of classic labor market performance such as 
unemployment and participation rates, returns to schooling, hourly wages and hours worked. 
The methodologies are applied to the Brazilian National Household Survey (PNAD) covering the 
period 2001-2012. The main results are presented below: 

-  Growth trends of shared and absolute prosperity show that growth rates of SP are 

higher than that of AP throughout 2001-2012, which implies that the bottom 40% of the 
population has performed consistently better than the average. While AP has been 
increasing at an annual rate of 3.64%, SP has been increasing at an annual rate of 
6.37%, resulting in an annual gain in growth rate of 2.73%.  

-  The contribution of income sources to total shared prosperity:  labor income is the 

most dominant factor shaping shared prosperity but its contribution has been declining at 
an annual rate of 0.53 percentage points in the 2001-12 period. The contribution of the 
Bolsa Família Program (BFP) to the shared prosperity had an annual increase of 0.52 
percentage points. The contribution of the Continuous Cash Benefit (BPC) has also 
increased but at a slower rate of 0.16 percentage point, while the contribution of social 
security has remained stable. 

-  Relative inequity in Brazil has been sharply declining over the 2001-2012 period. Once 
again, labor income has been the most dominant factor to this decline, contributing to an 
annual reduction of 0.40 percentage points. In contrast, BFP and BPC have contributed 
to reduction in inequity by 0.08 and 0.01 annual percentage points respectively. The 
sharp reduction in relative inequity has been contributed largely by labor income.  

-  Labor income for the bottom 40% of the population grew at an annual rate of 5.68%, 
which is predominantly explained by the productivity growth of 6.06%. The completed 
years of schooling for the bottom 40% of the population increased at an annual rate of 
4.26% and the average rate of return from schooling increased at 1.80% annually. Thus, 
it can be concluded that the education has played the key role in the growth of the SP. 
While employment and labor force participation rates have negatively contributed to the 
shared growth, the last has been largely contributed by the increase in productivity, 
expansion of education services and increasing returns from education. 

-  Total shared growth of per capita income was 2.74% per annum in 2001-2012, of which 

1.47% is explained by the expansion of education, 0.67% by the increase in the rate of 
return from schooling and 0.73% by the Bolsa Família. Contributions of BPC and social 
security are relatively small, while increases in employment rate and labor force 
participation rates have a negative impact in total shared growth. 

Shared Opportunities - The paper also extends the idea of shared prosperity to the one of 
shared opportunities that leads to a new measure of inequity in opportunities, calculated 

 

19 

from household surveys that provide information on individuals’ access to basic services in 
education, productive employment, etc. 

-  Employment Opportunities: the average employment rate has at an annual rate of 0.29 

percentage points. The employment rate for the bottom 40% of the population is also 
improving but at a slower annual rate of 0.17 percentage points. Thus, employment 
opportunities are not equitable and are becoming less so.  

-  Productive Employment: the percentage of employees with formal contract increased 

at the rate of 0.98 percentage points annually. Inequity in contractual employment has 
been sharply declining at an annual rate of 1.11 percentage points. Brazil has made an 
amazing progress in enhancing productive employment, which has been broad based 
with benefits going more to the poorest 40% of the population.  

-  Opportunity in Education Attainment: completed years of schooling of the occupied 

people have on average increased an annual improvement of 0.17 years. Education 
attainment for the poorest 40% of the population was only 3.84 years in 2001, indicating 
large inequity of 42.14%. Fortunately, education attainment in the basis of the distribution 
had an annual increase of 0.21 year, reaching 6.24 years in 2012, which contributed to a 
decline in inequity at an annual rate of 1.29 percentage points, reaching 27.33% in 2012. 
High inequity in education continues to exist, but Brazil has broaded its education 
benefiting relatively more the bottom 40% of the population.  

-  School Attendance: in 2012, even among the bottom 40% of the population, 97.79% of 

the children in this age group attended school. The gap in school attendance has been 
narrowing and there is hardly any inequity in school attendance for this age group, which 
is by itself a commendable achievement.
