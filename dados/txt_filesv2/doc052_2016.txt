The Mass Media Transmission of

Central Bank Communication under Uncertainty

Ana Cristina Pereira das Neves∗

Abstract

The media are one of the most inﬂuential institutions in society and, to most people, they are the only
source of information on central banks’ decisions. Considering that effectively managing expectations is
essential for policy success and given that the media inﬂuence public’s perceptions of monetary policy
issues, this paper proposes a theoretical model that incorporates the role played by the media in the
monetary transmission mechanism. When the general perception of uncertainty is affected by the news,
information release may lead to effects not anticipated by the central bank; therefore, the design of
communication strategies should go beyond the concern of providing information to ﬁnancial markets
and steering their behaviour in the direction desired by the central bank. In fact, the bank would be well
advised to explicitly acknowledge that most people only hear about its information through news outlets,
who inﬂuence their expectations and their response to central bank communication.

Resumo

A mídia é uma das instituições mais inﬂuentes na sociedade e, para a maioria das pessoas, é a única fonte
de informação sobre as decisões dos bancos centrais. Considerando que um gerenciamento eﬁciente das
expectativas é essential para o sucesso de política e dado que a mídia inﬂuencia a percepção do público
sobre a política monetária, esse artigo propõe um modelo teórico que incorpora o papel da mídia no
mecanismo de transmissão monetária. Quando a percepção geral com relação à incerteza é afetada pelo
noticiário, a publicação de informações pode levar a efeitos não antecipados pelo banco central; por
isso, a elaboração de estratégias de comunicação deve ir além do desejo de fornecer informações aos
mercados ﬁnanceiros e inﬂuenciar seu comportamento. Na verdade, o banco central deveria reconhecer
explicitamente que a maior parte das pessoas tem acesso às suas informações somente através da mídia, a
qual inﬂuencia as expectativas e as respostas à comunicação do banco central.

1 Introduction

Central bank communication practices experienced a revolution in the last two decades. Previously seen
as a secretive art, too mysterious for most people to grasp, monetary policymaking went through profound
modiﬁcations, guided by the principles of transparency and accountability. The emergence of inﬂation
targeting regimes and the recognition of the importance of effectively managing expectations for policy
success brought new incentives for the design of communication strategies that privilege sharing information
with ﬁnancial markets and the public in general. Questions about what to share, when and through which
means remain (and are vigorously debated), but the general understanding that good policies depend on good
communication is here to stay.

At the beginning of this change in paradigm, both academic research and central banks’ efforts were
concentrated on improving the ﬂow of information from monetary authorities to ﬁnancial markets, given the
inﬂuence of future expectations on ﬁnancial asset prices and on market conﬁdence in general. Developing
efﬁcient communication channels with market participants was seen as essential and good progress was
made in this area.

Perhaps surprisingly, however, little attention was paid to how the general public obtains information
on monetary policy and perceives central banks’ actions. Certainly, following ﬁnancial market prices and
behaviour is somewhat easier than gathering information on enormous numbers of households and ﬁrms
making daily consumption, pricing and investment decisions; but it is, by no means, less important as,
ultimately, it is their expectations and choices that determine the path of inﬂation (the main variable most
contemporaneous central banks aim to affect).

In the last few years, some researchers started to investigate this issue more closely, incorporating a
crucial insight: the existence of an intermediary in the communication between monetary authorities and
the general public. Unlike market participants, ordinary people have not the incentives nor the expertise to
collect and digest central bank information by themselves. As a result, they mainly rely on the media as
a tool for gathering, selecting, editing, simplifying and transmitting information. However, this process is
subject to errors and misunderstandings, which may inﬂuence what is actually communicated to the public
(in ways not desired nor anticipated by the central bank). Research has shown that the media are far from
being a neutral conduit; in fact, they transform the content they distribute, choose the tone in which it is
going to be reported and affect people’s perceptions of it. There is abundant evidence of media effects on
what the audience think about and how they feel about the issues that appear on the news. In particular, the
selection of events that are covered and the nature of coverage change beliefs about risk and uncertainty,
inﬂuencing behaviour as a result.

Building on the recent empirical work on how the media report central bank information, this paper
proposes a theoretical model that incorporates the media’s inﬂuence on agents’ beliefs after the central bank
releases an economic forecast. Taking into account results from mass communication theory and information
economics, we propose seeing the media as an important link in the monetary transmission chain. If the news
affects agents’ expectations of the future and if coverage is partial and potentially biased, then central banks
should take into account the inﬂuence of the media when designing their communication strategies.

Speciﬁcally, the model uses journalism’s concept of a “man-bites-dog” signal (formalized by Nimark,
2014)1 to deal with a scenario in which media reporting increases the perception of uncertainty, which in turn
affects private inﬂation expectations. When the public has access to central bank information only through
the media, the level of volatility will depend on the perceived accuracy of the central bank’s forecast. If it is
seen as very accurate, then it is possible for ex-post uncertainty to be lower even though media reporting
increases the general perception of volatility. However, if the bank’s estimation is seen as very imprecise,
then the actual levels of volatility and inﬂation are higher, output is lower and the exchange rate is more
appreciated, leading to the conclusion that the central bank should refrain from releasing forecasts that are

likely to be perceived as imprecise. But if there are legal disclosure requirements, publication should occur
in the fuzziest possible way, discouraging media reporting.

The paper is organized into ﬁve parts. Following this introduction, section 2 discusses the importance of
the media in contemporaneous societies, starting with some remarks on the pervasiveness of uncertainty, its
impacts on agents’ behaviour and the role of the media as the main information provider in this uncertain
world. It proceeds with a presentation of the main theories on media effects and concludes with a discussion
of the recent empirical research on media reporting of central bank communication. Then, section 3 presents a
theoretical model of how the media may inﬂuence agents’ perceptions of uncertainty and affect the results of
monetary policy. In a context in which news coverage changes the public’s beliefs about the level of volatility,
the media are more than a disseminator of information. Section 4 builds on this idea and on the results of the
previous section to draw some possible implications for the design of central bank communication strategies
taking into account the role played by the media. The paper ﬁnishes with a brief conclusion in which the
main points and results are stressed.

2 The importance of the media

The media are today one of the most inﬂuential institutions in society. They fulﬁll the essential role of
collecting, interpreting and reporting information, helping audiences to make sense of the world. However,
the relationship is not one-way. In the case of the government, while it provides information to the media,
it also tries to anticipate how people will react to news on policy moves and to the speciﬁc way in which
policy is presented in the news. This is especially relevant for monetary policy, as its effects are indirect
and subject to uncertainty, depending to a great extent on agents’ beliefs. For instance: when the central
bank makes reserves more easily available to commercial banks, its aim may be to stimulate lending; but,
ultimately, an increase in credit operations will depend on the banks’ willingness to lend and on ﬁrms’ and
consumers’ desire to borrow. In a situation where banks are pessimistic about the future, their liquidity
preference increases, causing a fall in their willingness to lend. Thus, if expectations are negative, cheaper
money may not be translated into an actual increase in the stock of credit, making monetary policy less
effective as a tool to stimulate demand (ARESTIS; SAWYER, 2006). This is an example of why effective
managing expectations is so important for policy efﬁcacy, which is a reason behind many contemporaneous
central banks’ efforts to improve communication with the public.

Talking about investment decisions (perhaps the most emblematic type of choice under uncertainty),
Gerrard (1994) argues that long-term expectations depend on people’s beliefs about the most probable
forecast (the best estimate of a likely future outcome), but also on the state of conﬁdence (the degree of
conﬁdence with which expectation is held, reﬂecting the fact that the best estimate may turn out to be wrong).
The state of conﬁdence “(...) is a state of mind, a belief about the adequacy or otherwise of the knowledge
base from which the forecasts of the future are derived. In contrast to forecasts, the state of conﬁdence cannot
be veriﬁed or falsiﬁed by actual outcomes” (p. 332), but can be inﬂuenced by a myriad of factors and agents.
One of them is the media.

Acknowledging that to most people the media are the only source of information on the monetary
authority’s decisions may help to improve the success of a given policy strategy, and even more so if we
consider that the media are more than a disseminator of information: they shape beliefs.

In this section, theories on media effects are brieﬂy presented, as well as some insights from information
economics and the emerging evidence on how the media translate central banks’ information to their
audiences.

Media eects theories and information economics

The study of mass communication is mainly concerned with how media content shapes beliefs, attitudes,
emotions and the world view of the audiences, particularly in the medium and long terms. Does the amount
of media coverage affect what topics people talk about? Does the way an issue is approached (the tone
of coverage) inﬂuence how people view the matter in question (positively or negatively)? Many mass
communication theories have been developed to deal with these questions. Among the most prominent of
them are the Agenda-setting theory and the Cultivation theory.2

The main idea of the Agenda-setting theory is that the media have a signiﬁcant role in setting the public
agenda. They may not tell their audience what to think, but they do inﬂuence what viewers think about.
Focusing on some subjects and arguments but not on others, the media inﬂuence the list of topics that are
object of public debate. Moreover, the audience not only obtain factual information on public affairs, but
also receive cues on the importance of each subject, attributing greater relevance to issues that are more
salient on the news. A cognitive process known as accessibility implies that prominent issues become more
memorable; this is the mechanism through which agenda-setting works: topics featured more frequently on
the news make a more lasting impression and are more likely to be remembered at later dates.

Since the pioneering studies of McCombs and Shaw in the 1960s and 1970s,3 many others have
investigated the agenda-setting role of the media. McCombs (2000) presents a comprehensive list of instances
in which empirical research has showed the media to have a signiﬁcant impact on public agenda at both local
and national levels in several countries, including Argentina, Japan, Spain and the United States.

Another important communication theory, originally proposed by George Gerbner in the 1960s, is
the Cultivation theory, which focuses on long term exposure to television. Its main idea is that frequent
exposure changes people’s perception of the world, over time inﬂuencing their conception of social reality.
Television projects a distorted image of the world, full of stereotypes and exaggerations that its audience is
unconsciously led to adopt. Its content cultivates speciﬁc values and beliefs, ultimately affecting people’s
behaviour. The proponents of the theory argue that these effects are small and gradual, but cumulative, over
time amounting to signiﬁcant impacts on our culture as a whole.

In their original studies, Gerbner and his colleagues analysed television content and the effects on viewers
for several years, focusing on the quantity of violence on prime time programming. They found that heavy
viewers (those who watched four hours a day or more of TV) were more likely to perceive the world as
much more violent than it actually is and to hold a general mistrust of people (GERBNER; GROSS, 1976).
Subsequent research has applied the theory to other topics, ﬁnding evidence that mass media cultivation
effects span over a diverse range of topics (health, religion, political orientation, gender roles, etc.).

These theories are not proposing that the media are the only factor affecting people’s beliefs. Indeed, the
old simplistic view of the media as an all-powerful entity has been left in the past, but they are still widely
recognized as one of the most important institutions in contemporaneous societies. Although they are only
one force affecting perceptions, the less direct experience a person has, the more her/his opinions are likely
to be inﬂuenced by the media (LISCHKA, 2014).4

The arguments and ﬁndings of mass communication research are consistent with results from information
economics. As Stiglitz (2015) reminds us, high quality information is essential for good decision making
but, in reality, the market for information is imperfect. Not only information is incomplete, but there are
incentives for it to be distorted, which alters outcomes even if agents are rational and know that market
imperfections exist. The pervasiveness of information imperfections imply that, even if agents (including

4 Certainly, in several contexts that media is not the most important determinant of people’s beliefs, as is well argued by Wu
et al., 2002. But if there is one area in which we can safely assume most people have no direct experience, it is monetary
policymaking, thus making them more likely to adopt the media standpoint.

news outlets) wish to learn everything about a given topic, they will not be able to - and this is not innocuous:
research shows that even a small amount of information imperfection has profound effects on outcomes.

Also, acquiring more information is not necessarily good for society as a whole, as it can adversely affect
economic volatility (STIGLITZ, 2001). Information economics helps explain economic volatility through the
notions of imperfect, costly and asymmetric information. As we will see later, these ideas can be applied to a
situation in which the public does not have direct access to a relevant piece of information produced by the
central bank, depending on media coverage. If the coverage biases the audience’s perception of uncertainty,
the result may be a higher level of volatility in comparison to a situation where information can be directly
obtained from the central bank (that is, a context without the presence of the media as an intermediary) and
also to a context in which information is not made available at all.

But before investigating this issue more thoroughly in a theoretical model, the next subsection explores

the recent empirical work on the media’s role as a disseminator of central bank communication.

Media and central bank communication

Central banks have direct control of the overnight interest rate only, but aim to affect longer rates and
asset prices to, ultimately, have an impact on crucial economic variables (rate of inﬂation, output growth).
This depends on the bank’s ability to inﬂuence private expectations, which in turn is related to the monetary
authority’s communication strategy: because some economic variables (exchange rate, long interest rates)
reﬂect future expectations, communication is an important element of monetary policymaking, especially
when inﬂation stability is pursued.

However, the set of private agents is highly diverse and not all of them are equally attentive to central
bank communication. While some are more easily reached (notably, ﬁnancial market participants, who have
greater incentives to follow policy announcements and moves), others only hear about central bank news
through the media - if at all. Reaching this second type of agent - the general public - is crucial for the bank to
be able to affect inﬂation expectations, as actual inﬂation depends on the beliefs and behaviour of households
and ﬁrms making their everyday consumption and pricing choices. Since these agents’ knowledge of policy
announcements is acquired indirectly via news outlets, the media’s perception and understanding of the
central bank’s actions and communication is essential for policy success: the media play a crucial part in the
expectations channel of the monetary transmission mechanism.

Several studies have focused on the effects of central bank communication on ﬁnancial markets’ per-
ceptions and actions, reaching the conclusion that markets pay close attention and respond to the monetary
authority’s announcements and signals (ANDERSSON; DILLEN; SELLIN, 2006; GUTHRIE; WRIGHT,
2000; CONNOLLY; KOHLER, 2004). Recently, some studies have found that market participants not
only collect information directly from the central bank but also resort to the media as a source of news
on monetary policy. Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2009) analyse the effects of press conferences (PC) held
after the announcement of interest rate decisions by the European Central Bank (ECB), ﬁnding that PC
add information not contained in the policy decision itself: ﬁnancial markets reactions are larger during
the conference, whereas the effects on volatility are lower. Also, the more unexpected the decision and the
higher the degree of macroeconomic uncertainty, the greater the markets’ reaction during the ﬁrst part of the
conference, when the policy rationale is explained. Ehrmann and Fratzscher show that newswire services
play an important role as disseminators of information conveyed during the press conference; in particular,
snaps summarizing the main points are closely followed by ﬁnancial market participants. Even though these
snaps are subject to errors and misinterpretations, they do constitute the information that actually reaches a
great part of the market (although the PC is televised, many agents receive the information in real-time via
newswire services). The authors conclude that press conferences may fulﬁll an important role in the monetary
policy strategy, helping to explain the central bank’s actions to the public and, as a result, contributing to
policy effectiveness.

In a study of four major central banks (Japan, United States, United Kingdom and the euro area), Hayo
and Neuenkirch (2015) analyse ﬁnancial markets’ access to monetary policy information, using a survey
with 195 participants from all over the world. They ﬁnd that, although the media are not a substitute for self-
monitoring, they are a tool widely relied upon. In fact, except for interest rate decisions in the respondent’s
home region (in which case self-monitoring appears to be more important), participants resort as much to the
media as to self-monitoring to follow central bank information. The authors highlight that agents’ perceptions
of the bank’s actions and communication are crucial, which implies that the media play a relevant role in the
monetary transmission mechanism; as a consequence, central banks should invest in clariﬁcation strategies
(especially with respect to the language used) to make sure their information reaches the intended audience
with as little noise as possible.

The papers cited above are only a small sample of the copious research on how markets perceive and react
to central bank communication, whereas studies on the general public’s perceptions are still rare. Blinder et
al. (2008, p. 58) notice that “virtually all the research to date has focused on central bank communication
with the ﬁnancial markets. It may be time to pay some attention to communication with the general public.
Admittedly, studying communication with the general public will pose new challenges to researchers — not
least because ﬁnancial market prices will be less relevant. But the issues are at least as important.”

Since then, some researchers have accepted the challenge and started to investigate how the general
public accesses central bank information. An important point they highlight is that while its rational for
market participants to closely follow central bank announcements and decisions, for the general public it is
rational not to, as they have other priorities. Acquiring and processing information is costly so it makes sense
for the public to rely on the media as an intermediary.

In a pioneering work, Berger, Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2011) studied how the ECB’s messages are
transmitted by the media, investigating the extent and favourableness of newspapers coverage of monetary
policy from 1999 to 2010. They found that the circumstances, nature and explanations of a policy action
affect the amount and type of coverage. The tone of reporting is more negative if a policy decision surprises
the markets and if inﬂation in the euro area exceeds the 2% target, suggesting that the media assume a
monitoring role of the ECB. But the bank is able to affect coverage through the use of communication
(in press conferences and inter-meetings statements): explanations of the reasoning behind a surprising
decision lead to a more positive assessment by the press. Moreover, the coverage of an interest rate change
is signiﬁcantly more favourable if it has been preceded by a systematic communication effort by the ECB,
except when inﬂation is high.

Following Berger, Ehrmann and Fratzscher’s approach, Böhm, Král and Saxa (2012) analyse media per-
ceptions of the Czech National Bank (CNB) policies in the period 2000-2007. Their empirical results suggest
that decisions that surprise the markets attract more coverage but are not more likely to be critically assessed.
Also, interest rate changes (in any direction) are welcomed and more extensively covered, suggesting the
media understand they are indeed necessary. Rising inﬂation leads to a more negative coverage while GDP
growth results in a more positive assessment (and vice-versa). More intensive inter-meeting communication
leads to favourable reporting when a policy decision is surprising. The authors conclude that the media seem
to understand the CNB monetary policy actions and tend to pay attention to relevant developments.

Applying the same methodology, Reid and Plessis (2011) study how the print media transmit central
bank communication to the general public in the case of South Africa. They ﬁnd biases in coverage,
with interest rate cuts being welcomed and rises criticized, regardless of the economic circumstances,
suggesting little attempt by journalists to understand the reasons behind the policy decisions and to reﬂect
on their appropriateness. Also, inter-meeting communication does not seem to inﬂuence media perceptions
of monetary policy. Given their empirical results, Reid and Plessis believe that the print media are not
adequately fulﬁlling their role of transmitting monetary policy information to the public: there are errors and
misinterpretations in reporting, including a lack of understanding of the inﬂation targeting system, which
jeopardize the effective use of the expectations channel of the monetary transmission mechanism. Therefore,

6

they conclude that there is room for a better use of communication by the South African Reserve Bank,
tailoring its language to the audience (considering that its messages are ﬁltered and edited by the media),
quickly reacting to clarify misunderstandings in the way policy is portrayed in the news and more effectively
using inter-meeting communication. A good understanding of the role played by the media should be an
input for the development of a coherent and effective communication strategy.

Lamla and Sturm (2013) study how the ECB’s policy decisions and the information provided during
press conferences are reported by the print media on the two subsequent days. Speciﬁcally, the authors are
interested in the effects of the bank’s statements on media expectations of future monetary policy. Using a
series of indicators, they ﬁnd that both the actual policy decision as well as ECB communication signiﬁcantly
impact expectations of future rates as transmitted by the media to the public.

Considering the literature’s suggestion that the media’s perception and understanding of monetary policy
is not neutral nor error free, and that they do inﬂuence people’s beliefs and behaviour, it can be argued they
play a role in the monetary transmission mechanism, which can therefore be depicted as in ﬁgure 1.

Figure 1 – Transmission of Central Bank Decisions and Communication

Note: Adapted from Hayo and Neuenkirch (2015).

The ﬁgure highlights the fact that most agents (the “general public”) only hear about monetary policy
decisions through the media, as they have neither the time nor the incentives to monitor the central bank
directly. As a result, they only receive policy information after it has been through a process of selection,
editing and interpretation, being therefore subject to biases and misunderstandings - although the degree of
this probably varies from country to country, as the research surveyed in this section indicates. Moreover, the
transmission chain proposed in ﬁgure 1 makes clear an often neglected aspect, brought to light by Hayo and
Neuenkirch’s research: ﬁnancial market participants also resort to the media when following the monetary
authority’s announcements and decisions. This additional layer of media inﬂuence is signiﬁcant as, even if
market players are consciously aware of the potential shortcomings of news coverage, they are not immune
to its subtle impacts on their beliefs.

In the next section a theoretical model that incorporates the media’s inﬂuence on public perceptions of

uncertainty is proposed.

3 Model

In this section central bank communication and the media’s inﬂuence on public’s beliefs are studied in a
model for a small open economy. Following Cukierman (2001), we adopt a neo-Keynesian transmission
mechanism, emphasizing the impact of the interest rate on aggregate demand and the lagged effect of output
on inﬂation. The small open economy is modeled similarly to Ball (1998); the only major difference if the
absence of persistence in output.

7

The open economy is described by four equations:

πt+1 = πe

t+1 + αyt + γet + zt
t+1 − et + ft

yt = −β rt + δ et + dt
rt = ee
rt = Rt − πe

t+1,

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

where all variables are in logarithms and presented as deviations from the steady state (except for the interest
rates), all parameters are positive and xe
t+1 indicates the expectation of the time t+1 value of variable x based
on the information available at the beginning of period t.

The ﬁrst equation is the aggregate supply curve, which relates time t+1 inﬂation to time t output gap yt,
real exchange rate et (an increase in e denotes a depreciation) and supply shock zt ∼ N(0,σ 2
z ). The second
equation states that aggregate demand is decreasing in the real interest rate rt and increasing in the real
exchange rate; also, it is subject to a shock dt ∼ N(0,σ 2
d ). Equation 3 is an uncovered interest parity (UIP)
condition, with ft ∼ N(0,σ 2
f ) representing a risk premium shock,5 and (4) is the Fisher equation, where Rt is
the nominal interest rate. All shocks are distributed normally and independently of each other.6

There are three types of agents: the private sector, the central bank and the media. The ﬁrst two make
forecasts of the risk premium shock. Private agents perceive the central bank’s forecast as a “man-bites-dog”
signal, as explained below.

The central bank aims to stabilize the output gap and inﬂation, choosing the nominal interest rate to

minimize their squared deviations from their targets, as represented by the following loss function:

Lt = (πt+1 − π∗)2 + λ y2
t ,

(5)
where π∗ is the bank’s (constant) inﬂation target (known to all agents). The target for the output gap is zero
(that is, the monetary authority aims to keep output at potential).

3.1

Man-bites-dog signal

The phrase “man bites dog” is used in journalism to describe an unusual event which, as such, is
considered more newsworthy than a more common, everyday fact, like a “dog biting a man”. While
commonplace facts appear less often on the news, rare events are more likely to be reported, which may
distort the public’s perception of how frequently an event occurs. Therefore, media reporting per se can be
seen as an indication that a “tail event” is more likely to have occurred (NIMARK, 2014).

Deﬁnition.7 A signal z about a variable x is a man-bites-dog signal if it is more likely to be available when
the realization of x is more uncommon. From Bayes rule, it is as if x were drawn from a different distribution
when z is available. Deﬁning S as an indicator variable that takes the value S = 1 when z is available and
S = 0 when z is not available, and p(x) as the unconditional probability density function of x, we have
p(x|S=1) (cid:54)= p(x|S=0). More precisely: for two realizations x(cid:48) and x(cid:48)(cid:48) of x such that p(x(cid:48)) < p(x(cid:48)(cid:48)), if z is a
man-bites-dog signal then the following inequality holds:

p(S =1|x(cid:48)) > p(S =1|x(cid:48)(cid:48)).

The risk premium shock adds extra uncertainty to the open economy versus a closed economy.

5
6 At this point an observation is in order, regarding the timing in the model. Notice that the lagged impact of output on inﬂation
does not actually imply a dynamic set up, but only that inﬂation is determined after output. The idea is simply to capture the
delayed effect of the interest rate on prices, via the level of activity: in the short run, changes in the nominal interest rate
translate into changes in the real rate, which have an impact on output. Subsequently, the change in output induces a change in
prices and, thus, in inﬂation. Additionally, there is an exchange rate channel in the model: an increase in the nominal interest
rate leads to an exchange rate appreciation, which has a negative impact on output.

In the context of our model, we assume that the central bank publishes a forecast f cb
t

(the signal) of the
risk premium shock ft, but that the media do not always report it (or, alternatively, usually do not give the
forecast any emphasis). When the media do report the forecast, it is often because it is an unusual/unexpected
forecast. The aim here is to model the fact that the news inﬂuences people’s perception of the overall level
of uncertainty;8 thus, when S = 1, the private sector’s perception of uncertainty increases. Formally, this
(cid:48)(cid:48)
happens because, under a “man-bites-dog signal structure”, for two realized values f
t of the risk
premium shock ft, such that p( f

(cid:48)
t and f

(cid:48)
t ) < p( f

(cid:48)(cid:48)
t ), we have:
t |St =1)
(cid:48)
p( f

p( f (cid:48)(cid:48)

>

(cid:48)
p( f
t )
p( f (cid:48)(cid:48)
t )

.

That is: the more uncommon realization is relatively more likely when the bank’s forecast is reported.

In our model, the private sector also makes a forecast, f ps

follows the distributions:

where ηcb

and η ps

are independently distributed.

When the central bank’s forecast (signal) is reported by the media, the agents9 update their conditional
prior distribution p( ft|St), as they aim to form expectations based on all available information (as long as the
cost of doing so is not prohibitively large).

Conditionally on St, ft is normally distributed:

p( ft|St = 0) = N(0,σ 2)
p( ft|St = 1) = N(0,θσ 2),
and the unconditional distribution of ft is a mixture of normals:10

θ > 1,

ft ∼ (1− ω)N(0,σ 2) + ω N(0,θσ 2), with E[ ft] = 0 and Var[ ft] = σ 2

f = (1− ω)σ 2+ ω θ σ 2,

where ω = p(S = 1); that is, ω determines the frequency with which the signal f cb

is a rare event. The parameter θ determines how informative the reporting of f cb

is reported. If ω → 0,

It is important to make clear that the availability of the signal changes the public’s perception of the
level of volatility, while the signal itself changes the perception of the value of the shock: Var[ ft|St =0] (cid:54)=
] (cid:54)= E[ ft]. That is: while media reporting changes the conditional variance,
Var[ ft|St =1], whereas E[ ft| f cb
the central bank’s signal makes the conditional mean of the risk premium shock differ from the unconditional
mean.

As in Geraats (2007), the public does not know the true distributional parameter values and, therefore,
forms expectations based on perceived distributions. Thus, for a variable x ∼ N(x0,σ 2), expectations are
formed based on N( ˜x0, ˜σ 2), where ˜x0 and ˜σ 2 are the perceived mean and variance of x, respectively. This
means that the actual degree of uncertainty is never known for sure, being to a large degree a feeling, an
impression, as argued in section 2.
8 As discussed in section 2, research shows that the media inﬂuence beliefs and people’s perception of risk and uncertainty.

In what follows we apply these ideas to a situation in which the private agents observe the central bank’s

sector to observe f cb

where the ˜τ’s represent the perceived degrees of accuracy of each forecast. For instance: ˜τps is the perceived
degree of accuracy of the private signal when the central bank’s forecast is not reported. In this case, for a
given (perceived) variance of the risk premium shock, the signal f ps

the variance of the error η ps
is perceived as small. But when the central bank’s forecast is reported and is,

therefore, incorporated into the public’s expectations-formation process, the accuracy of the private forecast,

cb.13

Given this set up, let’s deﬁne the sequence of events in the model: in time t, after the realization of πt
(which is determined by time t−1 variables), (1) the private sector and the central bank make forecasts
of the risk premium shock ft; (2) the media decide S (i.e., to publish f cb
t or not); (3) the public forms
expectations based on its own forecast and the central bank’s (if it is reported by the media), using the
perceived distributions of the shocks; (4) shocks zt and dt are realized and observed by the central bank; (5)
the central bank sets the nominal interest rate Rt; (6) shock ft is realized; (7) yt and et are realized; (8) πt+1
is realized at the beginning of period t+1.

To solve the model, let’s start by combining the UIP condition (eq. 3) and the Fisher equation (4) and

solve for the exchange rate:

et = ee

t+1 + πe

t+1 + ft − Rt.

(7)

Substituting (4) and (7) into the aggregate demand (eq. 2) gives output as:

yt = −(β + δ )(Rt − πe

t+1) + δ (ee

t+1 + ft) + dt.

(8)
And from (7), (8) and the aggregate supply (eq. 1) we get an expression for inﬂation as a function of
expectations and the nominal interest rate (plus shocks):
12

Possibly because central bank communication is confusing or because f cb
is not easily found among all the information
t
released by the central bank. Or still, because following central bank announcements is timing consuming and, therefore, too
costly for most agents.
To some extent, the ˜τ’s can be seen as proxies for the state of conﬁdence with which beliefs are held (as deﬁned and explained
in Gerrard’s work, mentioned in section 2): when agents have little conﬁdence on the accuracy of a prediction, it receives less
weight in the formation of expectations (that is, its respective ˜τ is lower).

(9)

The expressions above are the constraints on the central bank’s optimization problem. The bank chooses

Rt to minimize the loss function (5) subject to (8) and (9), which results in the following policy function:

a1(πe

The next step is to use the policy function to get expressions for inﬂation, exchange rate and output gap
as functions of expectations and the shocks only. Starting with inﬂation, let’s substitute (10) into (9) to get:

2(β ft + β ee

(11)
This expression shows that inﬂation will be above the target π∗ if (a) private sector expectations are higher
than the target; (b) the economy is hit by a positive supply shock, a positive risk premium shock (which leads
to a currency depreciation and an increase in import prices) or a negative demand shock;15 (c) the exchange
rate was expected to depreciate; or (d) the central bank underestimates the risk premium shock (the forecast
error ηcb
t

is negative).

.

t

We obtain an expression for the exchange rate by substituting (10) into (7):
et =−a1(πe

t+1 −π∗+ zt)+ (α a1 +λ a2)dt − β (α a1 +λ a2)( ft + ee

t+1) +[(a1− αβ )a1 + λδ a2]ηcb

1 + λ a2
2

which shows that the exchange rate will depreciate if it is expected to depreciate, if the economy is hit
by a positive risk premium shock (which induces capital ﬂight) and if the central bank’s inﬂation target
increases. On the other hand, higher inﬂation expectations and positive supply and demand shocks lead to an
appreciation (due to the rise in interest rates), and so does a positive central bank’s forecast error (as it leads
to a higher interest rate than would otherwise be necessary).

Finally, the expression for output results from combining (8) and (10):

yt =

−a1 a2(πe

t+1 − β ft)− a2[(a1 − αβ )a1 + λδ a2]ηcb
t+1 − π∗ + zt) + γ a1(dt − β ee

t

.

(13)

The output gap increases with the inﬂation target and the demand shock, and decreases with inﬂation and
exchange rate expectations, the risk premium shock and the central bank’s forecasting error (as they induce
an interest rate hike).
14 Because our focus is on the impact of central bank communication on private sector’s expectations and, through them, on
relevant economic variables, it is assumed that, unlike the private sector, the bank simply uses its own forecast to set the
interest rate (that is, the central bank does not solve a signal extraction problem). A reason for such behaviour might be a
belief that the central bank possesses better data and that the private sector’s forecast does not add any relevant information to
that already contained in the bank’s forecast. El-Shagi, Giesen and Jung (2014) present results supporting this assumption for
the case of the US. Hubert (2015) ﬁnds no empirical support for the hypothesis that private forecasts inﬂuence central bank’s
in a panel of ﬁve countries (Sweden, United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland and Japan), whereas the monetary authorities’
estimations do induce revisions on private forecasts.

15 A positive risk premium shock increases inﬂation because it leads to a currency depreciation and an increase in import prices.

11

In what follows, we analyse two situations: in the ﬁrst one, there is no media reporting of the central

bank’s signal, whereas in the second one the signal is featured in the news.

The central bank's signal is not reported

If the central bank’s forecast is not reported by the media, it is also not incorporated into agents’
expectations. Thus, from the point of view of the private agents, it is as if the bank had produced no signal,
that is, as if it were following an opaque policy stance with respect to information on the risk premium shock.

When the central bank’s forecast is not reported (S =0), we showed that:16

˜E[ ft|Ω0] = ˜τps f ps

t

.

(14)

And, as the private sector does not have any information about the supply and demand shocks, we have:
˜E[dt|Ω0] = ˜E[zt|Ω0] = 0. Therefore, taking expectation of (11) and solving for inﬂation expectations gives:
(15)

(cid:0) ˜E0[et+1] + ˜E0[ ft](cid:1) ,

˜E0[πt+1] = π∗ +

βλγ a2

a2
1

where ˜E0[x] denotes ˜E[x|Ω0]. When the public does not know the bank’s forecast, inﬂation expectations
deviate from the target if agents expect a change in the exchange rate or a non-zero risk premium shock.

Taking expectations of the exchange rate (eq. 12) and using (15) results in ˜E0[et+1] = 0.17 Therefore, if

the central bank’s forecast is not reported by the media, the best the private sector can do is to expect:

˜E0[πt+1] = π∗ +

βλγ a2( ˜τps f ps
t )

a2
1

.

(16)

From this expression we see that the private information ( f ps
) only matters for inﬂation expectations because
t
the central bank gives a positive weight to output stabilization (λ > 0). Otherwise, the public would simply
expect inﬂation to be equal to the central bank’s inﬂation target π∗.

The last step is to solve for the realized values of inﬂation, exchange rate and output gap, obtaining:

The expressions above show that the impact of the risk premium shock on inﬂation and the exchange
rate is positive and that the effect on output is negative. However, there is also an indirect effect through the
private forecast: as a positive f ps
increases inﬂation expectations, it leads to a higher rate of inﬂation and
t
to a lower output gap. But because it also induces an increase in the interest rate (due to higher inﬂation
expectations), it contributes to a more appreciated exchange rate (unlike the actual shock). The greater the
value of the forecast in relation to the actual shock (that is, the higher the private forecasting error), the more
likely it is for the second (negative) effect to predominate. Note that both forecast errors lead to a more
appreciated exchange rate because they induce the central bank to set nominal interests at a higher level than
it would otherwise be necessary.18

Media reporting of the central bank’s forecast leads the agents to incorporate this new information when

forecasts only matter for inﬂation expectations because the agents know the central bank values output
stabilization.The weight given to the shock’s forecasts depends on how inﬂation and output gap respond to
changes in the interest rate: if yt is very sensitive to Rt (large |a2|), inﬂation expectations are higher, as the
agents anticipate the central bank to be more reluctant to increase Rt; the opposite is true for the sensitivity
of inﬂation with respect to the nominal interest rate (the higher |a1|, the lower inﬂation expectations).

These results yield realized inﬂation, exchange rate and output gap as:

3.2 Discussion

Let’s now compare the realized values of the relevant variables and the unconditional expected losses
under each situation. From the expressions for inﬂation, exchange rate and output, it is straightforward to see
that, for a variable xt, the sign of x1

t depends on

t − x0

ps − ˜τps) f ps

(28)

Considering positive forecasts of the risk premium shock ( f ps
t > 0), a sufﬁcient condition for the
expression above to be positive is ˜τ 1
ps > ˜τps: the perceived accuracy of the private signal under a “man-bites-
dog” situation is greater than the perceived accuracy when the central bank’s signal is ignored. From the
expressions for the ˜τ’s, it can be shown that this will happen when:19

t > 0, f cb

˜σ 2
cb >

˜σ 2

1− ˜θ−1 .

(29)

For a given ˜θ > 1, the central bank’s forecast must be (perceived as) noisy enough. If that is the case, the
rate of inﬂation will be higher and output will be lower when S =1 vis-à-vis S =0.

Because the central bank’s forecast is ignored when it is not reported by the media, its (perceived)
variance ( ˜σ 2
cb) does not inﬂuence the (perceived) accuracy of the private signal. On the other hand, when
it is reported, the (perceived) accuracy of f ps
cb: as the accuracy is a relative measure and
t
depends on all the variances, even if there is no change in the perceived variance of f ps
, this forecast is seen
t
as relatively more precise when the central bank’s forecast is seen as noisier, which means that the weight
given by the private sector to its own forecast goes up with ˜σ 2
cb. And because inﬂation increases with the risk
premium forecasts, a greater weight on f ps
also means a higher rate of inﬂation. At the same time, we saw
t
from (19) and (26) that the output gap falls with the forecasts and, thus, is lower when the central bank’s
signal is reported and is perceived as relatively noisy.

increases with ˜σ 2

As a result, if the inequality in (29) holds, expected losses will be greater when S = 1: in this case,
into private expectations takes inﬂation and output further away from the targets,

reducing welfare. This can be easily seen by subtracting (20) from (27):

which is always positive if ˜τ 1

ps > ˜τps.

By comparing the posterior variances in (6), we notice that ˜τ 1

ps > ˜τps also implies that ex-post uncertainty
is higher when f cb
is reported compared to when it is not. Even though the agents have more information
t
when S =1, ex-post beliefs are more volatile because the central bank’s forecast is perceived as relatively
noisy. For a given level of noise, this will be even more so the greater the value of ˜θ, as in this case media
reporting is seen as an indication that very unusual realizations of the risk premium shock are considerably
more likely.20

Regarding the exchange rate, its value will the be lower (more appreciated) when the media report the
central bank’s signal and it is incorporated into private sector’s expectations. Because a positive risk premium
forecast increases inﬂation expectations and induces a rise in the interest rate, it leads to a more appreciated
exchange rate, and this effect is stronger when the central bank’s forecast is perceived as relatively very
noisy, as this results in a larger ˜τ 1
ps.

Note that the higher ˜θ, the smaller the value of ˜σ 2

cb necessary for condition (29) to hold, although ˜θ must
necessarily be greater than ˜σ 2 - media reporting must contribute signiﬁcantly to increase perceived volatility.
If this is not the case, then the coefﬁcient of the private forecast in (28) is negative and the whole expression
may be smaller than zero for a sufﬁciently large f ps

˜σ 2

If the private sector forecasts a high value for the risk premium shock and if the central bank’s forecast
error is not perceived as very volatile, then even though the agents see the media reporting of the central
bank’s forecast as an indication of a likely increase in uncertainty (that is, despite ˜θ > 1), it is possible for
ex-post uncertainty to actually be lower when S =1. In this case, because the central bank’s forecast is seen
as relatively precise, its incorporation into private sector’s expectations may indirectly contribute to reduce
the rate of inﬂation: from (28), we see that the direct contribution of f cb
to the rate of inﬂation is always
t
positive (it increases inﬂation); but, as a low enough ˜σ 2
smaller than zero, it
is possible that (28) is negative for a sufﬁciently large private sector forecast f ps
. Also, if (28) is negative,
t
inﬂation expectations are lower when S =1 and, as a result, the central bank sets the nominal interest rate
at a lower level, contributing to a relatively higher output; with output closer to the target, central bank’s
losses are smaller. As for the exchange rate, a negative value of condition (28) implies a more depreciated
rate. Hence, a central bank that produces good forecasts may have an incentive to make them easily available
(so as to reduce inﬂation expectations) even in a “man-bites-dog” context.

4 Implications for communication strategies

Forming future expectations is part of all economic decisions. Since the results of our present actions
unfold gradually over time, having a good idea of what the future may look like can easy the task of choosing
one of several different possible paths. As no one knows for sure what tomorrow will bring, collecting
information and making forecasts is important. However, even our best estimations are surrounded by
uncertainty, further complicating matters and compelling us to seek more information. In times of calm
and staleness, this may not be that crucial; but when uncertainty rises, many of us cannot really afford not
searching for more data. Data gathering may be costly, but so is making bad choices.

Accordingly, there is evidence suggesting that agents are more likely to pay attention to central banks’
announcements when uncertainty is high (EHRMANN; FRATZSCHER, 2009; FILARDO; GUINIGUNDO,
2008; FRATZSCHER, 2008). In the present paper, this situation is studied in a setting where the perception

of uncertainty is inﬂuenced by the media. As we saw, in a model in which the private sector does not actual
variances, the effects of the central bank’s risk premium forecast will depend on perceived variances. Under
high (perceived) volatility (modeled as a large perceived variance of the risk premium shock), a central
bank’s forecast seen as very precise may help to reduce inﬂation, increase output and contribute to a more
depreciated exchange rate, which may be desirable in the case of a small open economy.21 On the other hand,
if the central bank’s forecasting error is large and its forecast is seen as very volatile, its incorporation into
private sector’s expectations may actually lead to higher losses. This result is consistent with Cukierman’s
(2001) observations for the closed economy case, emphasizing that the release of central bank’s forecasts
may not be desirable. However, the long run recommendations that can be drawn from our model are more
similar to Issing’s (1999): as the bank’s forecasting capabilities improve, becoming more open about the
forecasts may be a good strategy. In an institutional setting in which the central bank is required to release
its forecasts, this means that the bank should keep a somewhat fuzzy communicating strategy while the
forecasts are still inaccurate. This could discourage (at least part of) the agents from using the forecasts, thus
preventing the inaccurate central bank’s information from having undesirable economic impacts. However,
during times of high uncertainty, the costs of ignoring the monetary authority’s communication are likely to
be larger; in this case, the poor-quality central bank’s forecasts will be used by the private sector and will
contribute to higher losses.

In the case of a central bank that has already implemented a clear and standardized procedure for
releasing its information (including forecasts) so that no agent has to rely on intermediaries to access or
interpret the bank’s data, the bank should invest in producing accurate forecasts but also in dissociating
media reporting of its information from an increase in uncertainty (i.e., it is necessary to reduce ˜θ). Holding
regular press conferences may help, as they should increase news outlets’ incentive to always publish the
bank’s information; and, if ω = 1, there is no reason for ˜θ > 1. That is: if the media always report the central
bank’s forecasts, it does not make sense for the public to associate the reporting with a higher degree of
uncertainty.

Studying the case of the US Federal Reserve, Neuenkirch (2014) notices that newswire services are
selective in their reporting. His results show that: (i) the more formal the communication event, the more
likely it is to be covered by newswire services; (ii) hierarchy matters: the likelihood of speeches by the
chairperson being reported is greater than other open market committee members; (iii) content matters:
speeches that contain direct information on the future course of policy are more frequently reported; and (iv)
the probability of a piece of information released on a Friday being reported is higher, perhaps because it is
easier to sell it to the audience before the weekend (when no communication happens). On the other hand,
monetary policy announcements are less likely to be reported if on the same day important macroeconomic
data is released; it is therefore better to avoid disclosing relevant information on these occasions. These
ﬁndings may help central banks design their communication strategies to increase the chances of media
coverage. More speciﬁcally, with respect to the model presented in section 3, Neuenkirch’s ﬁndings are
particularly relevant for those central banks with a good forecasting performance: following the author’s
suggestions would increase the chances of coverage, contributing to increasing ω and lowering ˜θ.

However, it is our belief that in many countries (especially emerging and small economies), the public’s
perception of uncertainty is very likely to be inﬂuenced by the media, there are costs to access and interpret
central bank’s information,22 the bank still suffers from a credibility problem and is unlikely to produce very
21

In a small open economy, exports represent a signiﬁcant part of aggregate demand; thus, if exchange rate depreciations have
an expenditure-switching effect (beneﬁting domestic production), they may stimulate output. If there are distortions in the
local economy that lead to an inefﬁciently low level of equilibrium output (as in the case of imperfect competition), then a
more depreciated exchange rate may result in an output level closer to what would actually be the socially optimal level in the
absence of distortions. However, in the present setting we can not be sure of all the effects of a higher exchange rate, as the
model lacks explicit micro-foundations.

22 As we saw, not only the general public but also ﬁnancial market participants rely on the media to learn about central bank
communication. Given the daily ﬂood of information reaching the markets and the often not-so-clear language used by
monetary authorities, even more sophisticated agents with higher incentives to follow the bank’s decisions choose to resort to

16

accurate forecasts. In such a setting, the best strategy is for the central bank to be opaque about its forecasts -
either by withholding the forecasts altogether or disclosing them in an unclear manner.

Regarding central bank information and communication in general (not only the release of forecasts), it
is important to recognize the inevitable delays and errors in public perceptions, which means that the bank
should invest in delivering its information in the simplest possible way, to avoid mistakes and confusions.
This can also help the media to report on the bank’s information more accurately and more frequently, as
journalists’ interpretation work will be facilitated. Over time, as the public is able to understand the value of
the monetary authority’s messages, the media incentives to report them more often should also increase: if
there is a social perception that central bank information is important, news outlets, interested in building
reputation and maintaining their audience, are more likely to cover it as often and as accurately as possible.
Insights from psychology can also be useful for the design of communication strategies. Madrian (2014)
explains that people use reference points when making evaluations and decisions (that is, they do not
make absolute judgments). From our discussion, it is possible to conclude that the media help to set these
references points, but Madrian argues that policy can also inﬂuence them. In fact, evidence shows that every
detail matters, such as language and even the name given to a government initiative, which is something
relatively easy to address. The simpliﬁcation of information provision reduces uncertainty, misunderstandings,
increases the perceived value of the information disclosed and is conducive to a more frequent and accurate
media coverage of communication events, to a better alignment of private expectations to central bank’s
intentions and to a more efﬁcient use of the bank’s information. Surely, the level of economic literacy of the
public also matters, which is an additional reason for the central bank to simplify its language and to work
closely with the government and the media to improve the general understanding of monetary policymaking.

5 Conclusion

This paper emphasized the role of the media as a disseminator of central bank information to the public.
Given the importance of communication for the effectiveness of monetary policy, we argued that it is essential
to recognize that the media are more than a simple intermediary between the monetary authority and their
audience: they collect, select, edit and interpret the bank’s information before transmitting it to the public.
In fact, an extensive body of research shows that the media shape beliefs, inﬂuencing people’s view of the
world - including their perception of uncertainty. This inﬂuence is strengthened by the rational inattentive
behaviour of the public, for whom it makes sense to rely on news outlets for information and to give no or
little weight to topics that are not on the news.

With this scenario as a background, we proposed a model to explain how media reporting of a piece of
central bank information can inﬂuence people’s perception of uncertainty which, in turn, affects the results
of the bank’s communication strategy. Applying Nimark’s (2014) insightful modeling of a “man-bites-dog”
signal to the context of monetary policymaking, the paper shows how media coverage of a communication
event may change private expectations, with impacts on the actual level of economic variables. Because rare
events tend to feature more often on the news, the reporting increases the audience’s perception of uncertainty:
the simple fact that the media decide to cover the communication event leads to a rise in perceived volatility,
affecting inﬂation expectations.

Focusing on the publication of a forecast of an external shock, it was shown that if the public perceives
this forecast as inaccurate, media reporting contributes to higher inﬂation and greater social losses. On the
other hand, if the bank’s forecast is seen as precise it is possible for inﬂation to be lower and output higher
(despite the greater perception of uncertainty caused by news coverage).

In light of the research discussed in section 2, it is plausible to argue that most people only hear about
central bank news through the media. If this is the case, there is room for central banks to work more

media outlets as intermediaries.

17

closely with news outlets. Strengthening the relationship with the mass media may help avoid errors and
misinterpretations, give media outlets incentives to cover communication events more frequently and enhance
people’s understanding of monetary policy. Acknowledging the media’s role in the monetary transmission
mechanism when designing communication strategies (especially under inﬂation targeting regimes) may
contribute to a more successful management of inﬂation expectations and, as a result, to an overall more
effective policy.

To prove that θ > 1 is necessary for f cb to be a man-bites-dog signal, we start by noting that the
probability p( f ) is decreasing in the absolute value of f . However, if f cb is a man-bites-dog signal, then
p(S =1| f ) is increasing in the value of f : the signal is more likely to be reported when there is an unusual
realization of the risk premium shock. From Bayes’ rule:

p(S =1| f )
p(S =0| f )

=

p( f|S =1) p(S =1)
p( f|S =0) p(S =0)

Given that the conditional distributions are normal and that p(S =1) = ω, it is possible to write:
