Financial Conditions and Macroeconomic

Volatility in Emerging Markets

Gian Paulo Soave∗

Abstract

This paper assesses the role of ﬁnancial conditions in the business cycles in emerging
markets. Evidence from nonlinear VAR relating macroeconomic variables to proxies of
ﬁnancial conditions suggest that: (a) stressful times occur with considerable frequency,
about 30% of time; (b) second moments of the main macroeconomic variables are regime
dependent, with consumption and investment being more correlated with GDP and
with larger volatility for all variables considered under ﬁnancial distress conditions; (c)
consumption is more volatile than GDP both under a regular ﬁnancial condition and in
a ﬁnancial distress period; (d) the duration of the ﬁnancial instability period is about 5
quarters; (e) and there are strong ampliﬁcation eﬀects related to the tightening of the
credit conditions.

Introduction

One of the most striking aspects of the business cycles in emerging markets (EMs) is the pattern
of the second moments of the macroeconomic data, particularly when compared to those of
advanced economies (AEs): emerging economies experience much more substantial and frequent
swings. Two empirical regularities can illustrate the diﬀerences between these groups: (i) GDP
is twice as volatile in the EM group as in the AE group; (ii) consumption has a higher standard
deviation than that of output in EMs, while the converse occurs in rich countries. (see, for
example, Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007; Uribe and Schmitt-Groh´e, 2017).

A large body of literature has been paying attention to the role of many distinct factors that
could potentially account for these diﬀerences, e.g., less developed institutional environments,
weaker economic policies, and greater dependence on (a few) commodities in EMs. However,
almost all known episodes in the recent years of sharp movements in the international ﬁnancial
markets coincide with massive changes in the volatilities in such economies. Not surprisingly,
recent researches have found a signiﬁcant role played by the ﬁnancial frictions in the business
cycles in EMs. (see Akinci, 2017; Chang and Fern´andez, 2013; Garc´ıa-Cicco et al., 2010).
Because the responses of these economies to ﬁnancial instability seems more pronounced than in

AEs—at least on average—, the state of the ﬁnancial conditions naturally emerges as a potential
explanation for the observed diﬀerences between EMs business cycles and AEs.1

Accordingly, in this paper, I assess the consequences of “bad” ﬁnancial conditions to the
dynamic behavior of macroeconomic variables in EMs. To do so, I employ an econometric
strategy that treats the ﬁnancial conditions as an endogenous state variable, allowing to access
the macroeconomic implications of distinct ﬁnancial states. I fed a Bayesian Panel Threshold-
VAR Model (BPT-VAR) with an estimated Financial Stress Index (FSI) for 25 EM economies
and used it to analyze the implications of ﬁnancial instability to the economy. Within the BPT-
VAR, I deﬁne the regimes as two diﬀerent states of nature indicated by the FSI: tranquil—or
normal—times are situations in which the ﬁnancial markets are relatively stable (low FSI),
while stressful times—or ﬁnancial distress—are periods of high ﬁnancial instability (high FSI).2
The BPT-VAR, with the embedded estimated ﬁnancial instability indicators, endogenously
estimates the threshold values at which each economy in the sample switches from one regime
to another. These thresholds allow to separate the data into the two diﬀerent regimes and to
calculate regime-dependent impulse response functions and regime-dependent moments.

The results that emerge from the empirical analysis show that ﬁnancial conditions are
essential to understanding the business cycles in EMs, inducing strong non-linear eﬀects. The
ﬁndings can be synthesized through the following empirical regularities:

(i) emerging markets are prone to frequent regime switching in their ﬁnancial conditions:
stressful periods occur with a considerable frequency in the data (∼ 30% of the time);3
(ii) second moments of the main macroeconomic variables are regime dependent: ﬁrst, con-
sumption and investment correlations with GDP tend to be higher in ﬁnancial distress
periods. Second, volatility is much larger for the GDP, consumption, and investment
in ﬁnancial instability contexts. These patterns suggest that decisions become more
dependent on the current income instead of the intertemporal—or permanent—income.
Thus, ﬁnancial frictions seems to be associated with raising credit constraints;

(iii) in both regimes, consumption is more volatile than the GDP;

(iv) the mean duration of ﬁnancial distress periods is 5 quarters;

(v) conforming with the facts (ii), impulse responses are strongly regime dependent for most
of the countries. Under ﬁnancial instability conditions, consumption and investment
responses tend to be strongly ampliﬁed. These ﬁndings are consistent with the notion of
the ampliﬁcation eﬀect of ﬁnancial frictions.

A critical problem when analyzing the empirical implications of ﬁnancial instability to EMs
business cycles is the limited data availability. I try to circumvent this problem by eﬃciently
extracting information from the data: ﬁrst, I construct a measure of ﬁnancial conditions for
each country using the method advocated in Koop and Korobilis (2014), which is more ﬂexible
then principal component methods as it is robust to gaps and unbalanced series. Second, I
estimate the BPT-VAR through Bayesian Panel VAR methods (see, for example, Canova and
Ciccarelli, 2013) assuming an hierarchical structure within each regime introducing a regime-

2Throughout the paper, I use the terms ﬁnancial distress, ﬁnancial instability or stressful times interchange-

ably.

3For a comparison, the so-called sudden stops are said to be rare events, occurring in less than 4% of time (see
Calvo et al., 2006; Mendoza, 2010). The methodology employed here treats such events as extreme realizations
of ﬁnancial distresses.

speciﬁc exchangeable prior similar to Jaroci´nski (2010).4 Such a prior is convenient here since
it express the beliefs that EMs share many features in terms of dynamics within regimes, and
the Bayesian pooling exploits information from all countries to eﬃciently make the individual
estimations, improving the accuracy when just a few observations are available for some country
in a speciﬁc regime.5

A large body of literature has focused on business cycles in emerging markets, mainly
motivated by the observed excess volatility of output and consumption in these economies. Many
studies on this topic have used structural models in the spirit of Mendoza (1991), augmented
with trend shocks in the spirit of Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) or with ﬁnancial frictions, as
in Neumeyer and Perri (2005), Garc´ıa-Cicco et al. (2010), Chang and Fern´andez (2013), and
Mendoza (2010). This paper is particularly related to the latter branch of literature, aiming
to assess the role of ﬁnancial friction in those economies. However, in this paper, I focuses
on characterizing business cycles from a reduced-form analysis perspective coupled with a
detrending technique, which is an avenue taken by Agenor et al. (2000), Lane (2003), and
Calder´on and Fuentes (2010). Moreover, I use a uniﬁed framework for many countries that
allows us to compare the impulse responses to shocks in GDP and in the ﬁnancial conditions
using a Bayesian Hierarchical Panel VAR structure similar to Ciccarelli and Rebucci (2006),
Canova and Pappa (2007), Jaroci´nski (2010), Canova and Dallari (2013), and Forero (2015).
The only diﬀerence is that here the model features a nonlinear regime-switching structure.

The paper does not try to oﬀer any explanation for the causes of ﬁnancial instability in
EMs. However, it is arguably important to understand the empirical implications of ﬁnancial
frictions for macro-variables as well as the degree of exposure of such economies to international
ﬁnancial shocks, which are my main focus.

The remainder of the paper is presented in three sections. Section 2 describes the method-

ology. Section 3 reports the results, and section 4 presents the conclusions.

Accessing Nonlinearities in the Emerging Markets

Business Cycles

This section outlines the methods employed to estimate the threshold transition parameters
for each country in the sample and describes how I extract the ﬁnancial stress index from the
data. I begin by describing the HTB-VAR model that implicitly links the exogenous estimated
ﬁnancial stress index to the economic activity. Then I present the procedure and the criteria to
select a variable to be part of the ﬁnancial condition indicator.

2.1 A Two-Regimes Bayesian Panel Threshold-VAR

I modeled each emerging economy as an individual threshold vector autoregressive (T-VAR)
model. Although ﬂexible, T-VAR models can suﬀer from high dimensionality, which is even
more problematic for emerging markets because of the limited length of the time series. I

4Gelman et al. (see also 2003).
5As shown in Hsiao et al. (1999) and further in Gilhooly et al. (2012), linear VARs with such a prior can
have very good small sample performance, even with only a few time series observations for each cross-sectional
unit. As T-VARs are linear conditioned to a regime, the small sample properties of linear VARs with hierarchical
prior schemes naturally extend to our contexts. Moreover, the BPT-VAR can be used within unbalanced panels,
and thus is able to extract all information available.

overcome this problem by eﬃciently using the cross-sectional information within a regime. To
do so, I combine the individual information with the cross-sectional information in each regime
introducing a hierarchical structure setup. Importantly, the particular hierarchical structure, as
represented by exchangeable priors, reﬂects the prior belief that countries tend to perform in a
similar fashion within a certain regime, although there might be diﬀerences between regimes.

2.1.2 Non-Linear Impulse Responses

To analyze the dynamic responses of the variables in this nonlinear context, we must take into
account both history and the possibility of a regime switch. These requirements are at odds
with traditional impulse response functions present in linear VARs since, by construction, they
are symmetrical and history-independent of the current state of the business cycles. To better
capture the nonlinear nature of the TVARs, I make use of the generalized impulse response
(GIRF) proposed by Koop et al. (1996), deﬁned as:

GIRFy(h, εt,Ht−1) = E[Yt+h|εt,Ht−1] − E[Yt+h|Ht−1]

(6)

where h is the length of the simulation horizon and Ht−1 is the history in period t.6

A concise outline of how to estimate the GIRF in a Bayesian VAR context is as follows:
given a period-t shock, εt, and the history of what happened within the system until t− 1, Ht−1,
take the i-th draw from the Gibbs sampler of the parameters of the model, e.g. Θ(i). For each
draw, compute GIRFy(h, εt,Ht−1|Θ(i)) for a hundred of possible paths. Then, all we have to do
is to integrate over Θ(i). To do so, we estimate GIRFy simply by computing

ˆGIRF y(h, εt,Ht−1) =

1
D

GIRFy(h, εt,Ht−1|Θ(i))

D(cid:88)

i=1

where D is the number of draws. As stressed by Galv˜ao and Owyang (2014), the GIRF in a
nonlinear context measures the eﬀects of a one-standard-deviation shock to a selected variable
on the endogenous variables, assuming a speciﬁc set of histories at the impact. In practice, note
that we can calculate GIRFy(h, εt,Ht−1) for speciﬁc events in Ht−1, which means that we can
condition the estimates for each regime, thus obtaining regime dependent impulse responses.
Moreover, the GIRFs are deﬁned so that the regime can chance over horizon.

6From now on, I use term impulse response meaning generalized impulse response functions.

5

The algorithm to compute (1) under the assumed priors is presented in the appendix C.
As the GIRFs are computed for a given draw of the parameters vector, the conﬁdence band can
be based on the uncertainty from parameters if we are interested in the idiosyncratic estimation.
However, as I focus on the average (panel) response, I compute conﬁdence band based on the
median impulse response for each country. In the next section, I discuss the method used to
estimate the ﬁnancial conditions for each emerging market to feed the BPT-VAR model.

2.2 The Financial Stress Index

A ﬁnancial stress index (FSI) is intended to be a broad measure reﬂecting the current state of
the ﬁnancial markets. Such an index is constructed as a continuous variable where ﬁnancial
crises are at one extreme, and normal ﬁnancial conditions are at the other. Usually, a FSI is
based on a combination of many ﬁnancial stress indicators for speciﬁc markets, with each of
them constructed from many diﬀerent observable variables, which enables the index to represent
the whole ﬁnancial system with one single measure.

Methods for extracting from data the information that can synthesize the state of ﬁnancial
markets are now well-established. They are usually based on principal component methods,
as in Hatzius et al. (2010), sub-index weighting schemes similar to Cardarelli et al. (2009),
or the Kalman Filter coupled with advanced weighting schemes, as in Koop and Korobilis
(2014). No matter what kind of method is used, the construction of a FSI faces identiﬁcation
problems. Moreover, one may face diﬃculties in choosing which sub-index should be included in
the broader index, as well as in deciding what variable can best represent a particular sub-index.

When constructing such a FSI for many countries, a common practice in the literature is
to limit the number of variables composing a sub-index—instead of using as many as possible—.
This is done for two main reasons: (i) data availability, which may be scarce when dealing with
emerging markets, and (ii) comparability.

Concerning (i), one can take advantage of the existence of common factors driving the
ﬁnancial markets, so that even a few variables may contain the most relevant information about
the common components. Thus, the marginal gain of information is a decreasing function of the
number of variables. When it comes to (ii), comparability is desired when one aims to analyze
the eﬀects of global shocks and spillover eﬀects on countries, as in Cardarelli et al. (2009) for
advanced economies and as in Balakrishnan et al. (2011) for emerging markets. In the present
case, we need a comparable proxy so that the central distribution of the common coeﬃcients is
unaﬀected by the index.

My measure of ﬁnancial stress in emerging markets closely follows that proposed by
Balakrishnan et al. (2011) for emerging economies. The authors argue that an emerging market
is likely to be inﬂuenced by ﬁnancial stresses coming from international markets —in particular,
from advanced economies and other emerging economies. Changes in factors such as global
GDP growth and prices such as interest rates can have a substantial impact on the ﬁnancial
conditions within an emerging market. On the other hand, a country-speciﬁc factor expressed
by the degree of ﬁnancial and trade linkages and macroeconomic vulnerabilities can make a
country more exposed to a ﬁnancial stress period.

However, while I follow Balakrishnan et al. (2011) in constructing and selecting the variables
to be included in our measure of ﬁnancial conditions, I extract the information from the data
employing the method proposed by Koop and Korobilis (2014). Such a method have many
advantages compared to the pure principal component methods widely used in the literature.
First, it account for an unbalanced set of ﬁnancial variables, a recurrent problem when it comes

6

to emerging economies—in which data is frequently scarce prior to 2000. Second, the method
takes into account that an ideal ﬁnancial stress index should only express shocks on the ﬁnancial
system, as emphasized by Hatzius et al. (2010). This can be done by estimating a system of
equations containing not only ﬁnancial variables but also macroeconomic variables expressing
the macroeconomic environment so that the macroeconomic information is purged from the
estimated index. Third, the weights are calculated from the data, so that the researchers can
stay agnostic from each of the ﬁnancial variables that should be included at a speciﬁc moment
of time.7 The appendix is devoted to presenting the method used in more detail.

I construct a Financial Stress Index for all countries for which I have suﬃcient data.
Following the suggestions by Balakrishnan (2011), our measure includes the following sub-
indexes:

Banking Sector Stress - FCI.1

(i) Banking Sector-β - This measure, given by the ratio of bank share prices to total share
prices, aims to isolate the stress of the banking sector in terms of the whole economy. It is
our ﬁrst choice sub-index to measure banking sector stress and is given by:

βc,t =

cov(rm

c,t, rb
var(m)

c,t)

,

where rb and rm are the returns to the banking sector stock index and the overall stock
index. A value β > 1 means that the banks are relatively riskier compared the average
volatility of the other markets. I estimate β using monthly data from DataStream based
on a twelve-months rolling window, assigning a value of 1 when β > 1 and 0 otherwise.
The overall return is proxied by the return of the S&P500.

(ii) Bank Spreads For countries with unavailable data to compute βc,t , I measure the stress
in the banking sector using the spread in the loan versus deposit rates using data from
the IFS.

Foreign Market Pressure - FCI.2 To capture instabilities in the exchange markets, I use
the exchange market pressure Index (EMPI) proposed by Eichengreen et al. (2004), which is
deﬁned as

(cid:33)

(cid:32)

EM P Ic,t =

∆ec,t − µc,∆e

∆Rc,t − µc,∆R

σc,∆e

σi,∆R

(cid:33)

where ∆ is the monthly variation, µ is the mean value, σ is the standard deviation, e is the
nominal exchange rate of local currency per dollar, and R stands for the reserves.

Equity Market Volatility - FCI.3 and - FCI.4 For the Equity Market, I use two sub-
indexes.

(i) FCI.3 Following Balakrishnan et al. (2011), I proxied the stress surrounding the security
markets by the negative of the annual variation of the overall index in country c, given by

7Moreover, although the computations are much more complex compared to a pure principal component
method, the method proposed by the authors is quite fast under certain setups. Combined with the high
ﬂexibility, computation cost is another reason why I choose not to include the ﬁnancial stress measure as another
layer in our TVAR. For example, the methods proposed by Lopes and West (2004) could be employed as
additional equations in the Gibbs sampler, but the computational burden would be increased.

7

∆12yc = yc,t − yc,t−12, where yc is the overall index in country c in period t.

(ii) FCI.4 The second sub-index attempts to capture the eﬀects of expected loss, risk, or
uncertainty about ﬁrms’ future proﬁts. An increase is expected in this variable when the
likelihood of a ﬁnancial stress period increases. To construct this measure, I estimate
simple GARCH(1,1) models for each of the emerging economies in our sample using the
following process:

c,t = ω + φc,1ε2
σ2

c,t−1 + φc,2σ2

c,t−1 + c,t

where σ2
index.

t is the variance of a regression of an AR(1) regression for the overall equity price

Sovereign Debt Stress - FCI.5

(i) EMBI+ The EMBI+, as calculated by J.P.Morgan, is our preferred measure of stress

related to sovereign debts.

(ii) Sovereign Spread 1 For countries where EMBI+ is unavailable or to short, I use the
spread between the interest rate on sovereign debt in country c and 3-month USA bonds.

(iii) Sovereign Spread 2 Alternatively, I use the spread between security markets in country

c compared to the USA.

(iv) Sovereign Spread 3 Finally, for countries with gaps in EMBI+, I ﬁll the missing data

using credit default swaps (CDS) data.

3 Estimations and Empirical Findings

The datasets used in this paper are presented in Tables 5 and 6 in the appendix. They encompass
ﬁnancial as well macroeconomic data from a set of 25 emerging economies. The only criterion
for a country to be selected is data availability. For the FSI, I use monthly data to construct
the sub-indexes described in the previous section and take the quarterly average after ensuring
that the series are stationary and free of seasonality eﬀects. For the GDP, consumption, and
investment, I use the logarithm of the real values and compute deviations from a trend (HP-Filter
and BN-Filter proposed by Grant and Chan (2017) and Kamber et al. (2018), respectively). As
the data come from many diﬀerent sources and are of diﬀerent time spans, I refer the reader to
the aforementioned tables to access detailed information.

Lets start by presenting the results for the FSIs. As suggested by the visual inspection of
Figure 1, the frequency of ﬁnancial stress periods in EMs seem quite high. Importantly, there are
clearly two distinct pictures. Prior to 2004, ﬁnancial instability appeared to be governed by both
international and idiosyncratic forces. From 2004 onwards, the international markets’ condition
seems to be the most important determinant of ﬁnancial stability. However, a comprehensive
study of the determinants of the FSI in EMs is out of the scope of this paper. For the interested
reader, I refer to Balakrishnan et al. (2011) and Park and Mercado (2014). Plots of the individual
series are available upon request.

Figure 1: Estimated FSI for all countries in the sample

To analyze the implications of ﬁnancial instability and how it dynamically aﬀects an
emerging economy, I estimate the BPT-VAR embedded with the estimated FSIs. I setup each
VAR equation as follows:



 yc,t

cc,t
ic,t
f sic,t

yc,t =

where yc,t is GDP, cc,t is consumption, ic,t is investment and f sic,t is the ﬁnancial stress index.
Because of the limited time span, I restricted the maximum lag to 3, with Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) favoring a BPT-VAR with one lag. Using the priors described in section 2.1,
settled under a fairly loose scheme, I ran the Bayesian algorithm to search for endogenous
regime-switching in the sample. The results are expressed in Figure 4 in the appendix and are
summarized in Table 1.

From the BPT-VAR estimates, EMs are economies prone to frequent ﬁnancial instabilities
that may have consequences for macroeconomic variables. In the sample, a typical emerging
economy switches from one regime to another about 30% of the time. Moreover, when a crisis
begins, it takes about one and a half years for the economy to return to a stable ﬁnancial
condition.

Turning to the analyses of the empirical implications of ﬁnancial distress, I use the estimated
unobservable threshold parameters for each EM in the sample to separate each time series into
periods of ﬁnancial instability and periods of tranquility. Then, using the separated time series,
I compute the regime-dependent moments —i.e., business cycle moments within regimes—and
compare them between regimes. The results are expressed in Table 2.

Financial frictions have serious implications for EMs, aﬀecting the business cycles in
a nonlinear fashion. For moments, there are two major consequences: ﬁrst, correlations of
consumption and investment with the GDP tend to be higher in ﬁnancial instability regimes
relative to tranquil times. The relative correlation between regimes for consumption is about
0.97 and is 0.865 for investment. Although the result for consumption may be an artifact of the

small sample, the diﬀerence for investment is substantial. The volatility implications are less
subtle. As one can expect, the volatility in a ﬁnancial distress regime is much more pronounced
than in a normal regime. While the GDP tends to show an average increase of about 39% in
volatility in times of stress, consumption volatility magniﬁes by about 49% and investment by
about 95%, on average.8

I also investigate whether the standard deviations of consumption and investment change
between regimes relative to the standard deviation of the GDP. This analysis is of interest since
it can shed some light on how intertemporal decisions are aﬀected by tighter credit constraints.
The results, presented at the bottom of Table 2, show that as ﬁnancial conditions deteriorate,
consumption and investment become even more volatile than the GDP. This means that
households and ﬁrms may face more diﬃculty in anticipating future income to buy consumption
and investment goods. These results echos those of the literature on the phenomenon called
excess volatility. Here, under ﬁnancial distress, the excess volatility worsens.

The better understand how ﬁnancial frictions translate to the dynamics of macro-variables,
I now simulate shocks on the GDP and FSI and compute the GIRFs. The GIRFs are computed
within a regime but allowing for the possibility of a regime-switch. Starting with the histories
in one regime for a certain country, I simulate the evolution of the VAR system for 40 quarters

8These results are simple averages from the two ﬁlter methods. The term “about” is used to express both

the estimation and ﬁlter uncertainties.

with and without the shock of interest, compute the diﬀerences between the simulated paths,
and take the average responses. In such a context, the GIRF measures the responses of the
endogenous variables to a shocked variable at some horizon h within a speciﬁc regime r. The
conﬁdence band is calculated from the draws of the VAR coeﬃcients from the last 1,000 draws
in the Metropolis-within-Gibbs-sampler.

Lets ﬁrst analyze the eﬀects of a positive shock of one standard deviation on the GDP gap.
The results are expressed in Figures 2. The ﬁrst and most interesting point to note is that, for
almost all of the cases, the non-linear eﬀects previously identiﬁed in business cycle moments are
also expressed in the GIRFs.9 Second, there are clearly heterogeneous responses both within
regimes as well as between regimes.

line: ﬁnancial distress. Conﬁdence interval for ﬁnancial distress periods omitted for simplicity.

To be speciﬁc about the nonlinear eﬀects found in the data, the responses in the ﬁnancial
distress regime are much larger than in the normal regime. Since accounting for these diﬀerences
by looking at such a large number of plots can be cumbersome, I calculate a measure of the
mean ampliﬁcation eﬀects in the sample caused by the presence of ﬁnancial friction. I do so by
taking the mean diﬀerence between the responses in regimes 2 (stressful times) and 1 (normal
times). A positive sign means that the response in regime 2 is more pronounced than in regime
1, assuming that both have the same sign. I compute the diﬀerences both at impact—meaning
the impact in the ﬁrst period—and on the cumulated impact, calculated from the cumulative
impulse responses. The results are shown in Table 3 expressed via the mean diﬀerences in the
sample. At impact, the responses of the GDP tend to be almost 89.8% higher in regime 2.
For the consumption, the diﬀerence is somewhat lower compared to the case of the GDP but
still quite pronounced: approximately 79.4% higher in regime 2. For investment, the diﬀerence

between the regimes rises dramatically, reaching 134.4%. When the eﬀects are cumulatively
summed over all of the simulated horizon, we see that the diﬀerences continue to increase. Our
result suggests a large ampliﬁcation eﬀect due to the presence of ﬁnancial frictions, which is in
line with the ﬁnancial accelerator literature (see, for example, Bernanke et al., 1999; Kiyotaki
and Moore, 1997).

I repeat the previous exercise, but now for a positive one standard deviation shock on the
ﬁnancial instability proxy. This shock is interpreted as worsening the ﬁnancial conditions in a
speciﬁc regime. For brevity, the results are expressed for only four countries in Figure 3. As the
GIRFs make clear, poor ﬁnancial conditions are pervasive to EMs. As the credit conditions
worsen, independently of the regime, GDP, consumption, and investment fall. Speciﬁcally, the
eﬀects in regime 2 are more pronounced than in regime 1, with some countries experiencing
severe impacts, as in Malaysia and Romania in the ﬁgure. Complementing these ﬁndings, table 4
shows the mean diﬀerences in the responses both at impact and cumulated for the simulated
horizon. For the sample as a whole, tightening ﬁnancial conditions—captured by a positive
shock to the Financial Stress Index—reduces the GDP, consumption, and investment in both
regimes. The negative eﬀects are again more intense in the ﬁnancial distress regime.

Therefore, not only do the ﬁnancial conditions imply regime switches with remarkable
frequency in the emerging economies, but also adverse ﬁnancial shocks are propagated in a very
nonlinear and asymmetrical fashion in these economies.

4 Conclusion

This paper provides an empirical characterization of the dynamics imposed by ﬁnancial instability
periods to the emerging markets’ business cycles. In a ﬁrst step, I estimate a Financial Stress
Index (FSI) by employing dynamic factor methods and show that ﬁnancial markets in emerging
economies frequently feature events of ﬁnancial instability. Then, in a second step, I use a
Bayesian Panel Threshold VAR (BPT-VAR) model fed with the FSI estimated for each country
in the sample (25 emerging economies) to estimate a transition variable indicator that indicates
whether the economy is under a normal ﬁnancial stability or under a ﬁnancial distress period.

The results suggest that ﬁnancial instability may aﬀect both the correlations and the
volatilities of two important macro-aggregates, consumption and investment, and can also
generate enormous asymmetries between regimes. In summary, when economies experience
tranquil times and good conditions in ﬁnancial markets, their business cycle properties are
remarkably diﬀerent from those in a ﬁnancial distress period. During such events, EMs tend to
be much more volatile, and such behavior has implications not only for the second moments of
the data but also for the dynamics of the macro-variables. Moreover, shocks are propagated in a
regime-dependent fashion: in a ﬁnancial instability regime, shocks to GDP have a larger (much
larger, in some cases) eﬀect on real variables such as output, consumption, and investment.
Thus, I interpret these results as suggesting that ﬁnancial frictions play a crucial role in the
business cycles in emerging markets. Within diﬀerent channels, the ampliﬁcation eﬀects seems
to be crucial.

Finally, it is important to point out that analysis here has important policy implications.
Policymakers in EMs may wish to introduce policies trying to reduce the likelihood and
magnitude of a ﬁnancial crisis. From a theoretical point of view, one of such policies would be a
macroprudential capital control in the spirit of Jeanne and Korinek (2010) and Bianchi and
Mendoza (2017). In practice, such policies would require monitoring the leverage ratio in booms
and bust levying tax to aﬀect the incentives of the agents to take on debt in riskier times.

Each Regime

The posterior distribution of the parameter λr is the tightness of the prior distribution of the
VAR coeﬃcients for a regime r. Following Gelman (2006), we use a fairly loose prior to allow
the data speak. As suggested by Figure 5, the degree of cross-sectional shrinkage is similar and
well identiﬁed in the two regimes.

D Estimation of the Financial Stress Index

This section brieﬂy describes how we estimate the FSI. We construct all sub-index using monthly
data from various sources prior to converting them to a quarterly basis and taking the average
values in a quarter, as described in Table 5.

Let xc,t be a vector of length nc × 1 , where t = 1, . . . , T c, containing ﬁnancial sub-indexes
composing an overall ﬁnancial index and hc,t = (gc,t, mc,t, πc,t)(cid:48), where gt is the GDP growth in
country c, mt is the growth of M 1, and πt is the inﬂation rate. We assume a TVP-FAVAR with
the following form:

c,t) are regression coeﬃcients. We assume
that uc,t ∼ N (0, Vc,t) and εc,t ∼ N (0, Qc,t), where Vt e Qt are time varying. The identiﬁcation is
based on the commonly used hypothesis that Vt is a diagonal matrix, such that ut is a vector of
idiosyncratic shocks, and fc,t has all relevant information pertaining to ﬁnancial variables. For
each country, we also assume that the time-varying parameters evolve as random walks of the
form:
