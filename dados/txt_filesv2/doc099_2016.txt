Abstract 
 
This article aims to investigate the export performance of the so-called BRICS countries: Brazil, Russia, India, China and 
South Africa. By making use of ARDL models for the period from January 2000 to December 2014, the results suggest the 
existence of asymmetries when considering which variables are important influences in the long run. Export performance 
relies mainly on: i) foreign demand and commodity prices, in the case of Brazil; ii) real effective exchange rate, foreign 
demand and commodity prices (Russia); iii) real effective exchange rate and commodity prices (India); iv) real effective 
exchange rate and foreign  demand (China); v) foreign demand (South Africa). The estimated coefficients for the error 
correction mechanism shows higher speed of adjustment for Brazil and China, intermediate speed for India, and lower for 
Russia and South Africa.

Introduction  

The BRICS countries account for a group of emerging market economies (Brazil, Russia, India, 
China and South Africa) which have had a considerable expansion of their export sector in the past 
few years, with similarities, but also differences, in their pattern of export diversification. And there is 
no doubt that a country’s export performance is crucial for a sound current account and, consequently, 
a sound balance of payments, contributing to short run and long run economic growth and economic 
development. 

The performance of exports of the BRICS countries is an important issue on the basis not only 
of  their  impact  on  each  domestic  economy,  but  also  because  there  is  a  tendency  of  increasing 
participation of the BRICS in world trade and global economic performance. Despite the recent crisis, 
the BRICS can become a group capable of boosting world economic growth, trade flows and financial 
resources.  Along with a  high consumption growth potential, due to the emergence of a new middle 
class and to the size of their populations, such export performance is helping BRICS countries catch up 
to industrialized nations much faster, although they have not yet reached the level of development of 
advanced economies.  

The aim of this article is to investigate the export performance for Brazil, Russia, India, China 
and  South  Africa  (BRICS)  by  applying  the Autoregressive  Distributed  Lag  (ARDL)  bounds testing 
approach to cointegration. For the period ranging from January 2000 to December 2014, the variables 
used are exports, real effective exchange rate (level and volatility), world imports (proxy for foreign 
demand) and commodity prices. We were able to reject the null of no long run relationship for each 
country, indicating the existence of cointegration among the variables used in our empirical analysis. 
The empirical results suggest that in the long run, export performance relies mainly on real effective 
exchange  rate  (level  and  volatility)  and  foreign  demand,  in  the  case  of  China  and  Russia,  foreign 
demand and commodity prices (Brazil), real effective exchange rate and commodity prices (India) and 
on foreign demand in the case of South Africa. 

Besides this introduction, this paper reviews the  literature in Section 2. Section 3 shows the 
data used in the analysis as well as the econometric methodology and Section 4 reports the results. The 
last section concludes the article. 

 
Literature Review 

2. 

The literature on exchange rate volatility and trade flows is quite extensive and the purpose of 
this section is to summarize the general empirical findings and in a second moment to focus on the 
empirical studies and lessons for the BRICS. As a general rule, one can say that it is difficult to draw 
an unambiguous conclusion of the effect of exchange rate volatility on trade flows, regardless of the 
econometric  method  used,  with  the  coefficient  on  volatility  suggesting  a  positive,  negative  or  no 
impact.1 
 
Previous studies [Ethier (1973) and Hooper and Kohlhagen (1978)] show that higher exchange 
rate volatility is associated with higher costs for traders that are risk averse and ultimately to lower 
foreign  trade.  The  main  argument  is  that  if  changes  in  exchange  rates  become  unpredictable  it  is 
associated with uncertainty on the profits of international traders and ultimately it reduces the benefits 
of international trade.  
 
Assery  & Peel (1991) investigate the effects of  exchange rate  volatility on exports using an 
error correction model and the results supports the significant impact of real exchange rate volatility on 
exports. 
 
De Grauwe (1988) and Clark (1973) are examples of empirical  studies casting doubt on the 
negative  effect  of  higher  exchange  rate  volatility  on  trade  flows  based  on  the  argument  that  if  the 
income effect dominates the substitution effect the final outcome can be a positive relationship.   

                                                         
1 Sousa et al. (2008) develop a literature review based on 52 previous studies from 1998 to 2005 on the determinants of 
export performance and highlight that they can be characterized by fragmentation and diversity.

In order to evaluate the impact of exchange rate volatility throughout the literature one can rely 
on the lessons summarized by McKenzie (1999) and Bahmani-Oskooee and Hegerty (2007). The main 
empirical finding from Bahmani-Oskooee and Hegerty (2007) indicates that there is no consensus on 
the  effects  of  exchange  rate  volatility  on  export  and  import  flows,  especially  when  analyzing  the 
floating period (post 1973) when most countries faced an increase in exchange rate volatility.  
Arize  et  al.  (2000)  investigate  the  impact  on  export  flows  (1973-1996)  for  a  set  of  13 
 
developing  economies  using  cointegration  analysis  and  the  results  suggests  that  an  increase  in 
exchange rate volatility is associated with a negative impact on export demand both in the short and 
long run. 
Examining  studies  using  the  same  empirical  approach  developed  by  this  paper  (ARDL 
 
cointegration  analysis),  Huchet-Bourdon  and  Korinek  (2011)  analyze  the  impact  of  exchange  rates 
(level and volatility) on trade flows for two sectors (agriculture and manufacturing / mining) in China, 
the  Euro  area  and  the  United  States.  The  empirical  results  highlight  the  existence  of  a  significant 
impact of exchange rate (level) on trade flows but only minor effect for the exchange rate volatility. 
There is also evidence of a higher long term effect of the real exchange rate on exports than on imports 
and the income effect is more relevant than the price effect on trade flows.  
 
Vieira and MacDonald (2016) investigate the relationship between real effective exchange rate 
volatility and exports for a sample of 106 countries with data from 2000 to 2011 using System GMM 
panel  data  analysis.  The  empirical  results  corroborates  the  view  on  the  significant  role  of  the  real 
effective exchange rate volatility for export performance but the results are robust only when oil export 
countries  are  part  of  the  sample  when  an  increase  (decrease)  in  exchange  rate  volatility  reduces 
(increases) export volume and there is evidence that export volume is price and income inelastic.   
 
After this brief review of the empirical literature we can now focus on the studies applied for 
the BRICS countries. The first part is based on individual country studies and the second one for the 
BRICS as a set of countries. 
 
Ekanayake et al. (2012) examine the effect of exchange rate volatility on South Africa´s trade 
(exports and imports) with the EU for the period of 1980 to 2009 using the bounds testing approach to 
cointegration,  and  error-correction  model.  The  results  for  exports  indicate  that  exports  positively 
affected by foreign income and negatively by relative prices and exchange rate volatility.  
 
Srinivasan  and  Kalayvani  (2013)  investigate  the  role  of  exchange  rate  volatility  on  export 
growth for India from 1970 to 2011 using the ARDL bounds testing approach. The empirical results 
support the existence of cointegration between exchange rate volatility, real exchange rate, domestic 
and foreign GDP. Exchange rate volatility has a negative impact on real exports in the short and long 
run while the real exchange rate (level) has negative impact in the short run and a positive one in the 
long run. Domestic GDP has a positive long run impact on real exports but no role in the short run. 
There is also evidence that foreign demand has negative impact on short run but a positive one in the 
long run. 

Todani & Munyama (2005) examines the role of exchange rate volatility on export flows for 
South Africa using the ARDL bounds testing approach with quarterly data for the period 1984 to 2004. 
Depending  on  the  measure  of  volatility  used,  the  results  show  that  either  there  exist  no  impact  of 
exchange rate volatility on export flows or when such impact does exist it is a positive one.2 
 
Chit (2008) examines the role of exchange rate volatility for bilateral export performance for 
the ASEAN-China free trade area using a generalized gravity model for a panel data of 20 bilateral 
observations using quarterly data from 1982:Q1 to 2005:Q1. The panel unit root tests corroborate the 
existence  of  a  long  run  relationship  between  exchange  rate  volatility  and  exports.  The  fixed  and 
random  effect  estimated  models  suggest  that  bilateral  real  exchange  rate  volatility  has  a  negative 
impact on ASEAN-China bilateral exports but the magnitude of the effect is small.  
 
Aguirre  et  al.  (2007)  investigate  the  impact  of  exchange  rate  volatility  on  the  export  of 
manufactured goods in Brazil for 1985 to 2002 using the ARDL cointegration analysis. The authors 
found  the  existence  of  a  long-run  relation  (cointegration)  between  the  volume  of  Brazilian 
                                                         
2 Similar results for South Africa were found by Nyahokwe & Ncwadi (2013).

The second part of the empirical literature review focus on the BRICS as a group of countries 

manufactured exports and the real effective exchange rate, the real exchange rate volatility, the output 
gap (manufacture sector) and the level of world imports (proxy for foreign income). 
 
Cavalcanti  &  Ribeiro  (1998)  found  that  relative  prices  (exchange  rates)  are  relevant  in 
explaining Brazilian  exports. Neves et  al. (2007) estimates exports price and income elasticities for 
seven  Brazilian  states  and  the  results  indicate  that  state  exports  are  price  and  income  inelastic. 
Markwald & Puga (2002) argues in favor of a positive (negative) impact of exchange rate depreciation 
(appreciation) on exports but the effect is higher when there is exchange rate depreciation, supporting 
the  hysteresis  hypothesis.  The  authors  suggested  that  periods  of  exchange  rate  depreciation  are 
associated with an increase in the size (number of companies) of the export base. 
Vieira et al. (2014) investigate the role of the trade-weighted real exchange rate and foreign 
 
income on the export performance of Brazilian states using data from 1996 to 2009 for a panel data 
estimation based on System GMM. The empirical results suggest that state exports are price (exchange 
rate) and income (foreign) inelastic. There is also evidence that the real exchange rate effect for non-
Mercosur  partners  plays  a  significant  role  on  state  export  performance.  The  estimation  for  the 
Mercosur export partners reveals that lagged exports and commodity prices are significant, but there is 
no robust evidence on the role of trade-weighted GDP and lagged trade-weighted real exchange rate. 
The results do not reveal statistical significance for current trade-weighted real exchange rate and state 
GDP.  
 
instead of individual country studies.  
 
Gouvea et al. (2013) investigate the export performance and diversification strategies for the 
BRIC  countries  using  two  portfolio  approaches  (Markowitz  and  single  index  model).  The  results 
indicate that China’s export portfolio dominates the portfolios of Brazil, India, and Russia and China 
has a more diversified export profile.  
 
Naudé  &  Rossouw  (2011)  analyzes economic  performance  and  export  diversification  in  the 
BCIS( Brazil, China, India and South Africa) for the period of 1962 to 2000 using Granger causality 
tests  and  applied  general  equilibrium  (AGE)  models.  There  is  evidence  of  a  U-shape  relationship 
between per capita income and export specialization (China and South Africa) and partial evidence 
that export diversification Granger causes GDP per capita in Brazil, China and South Africa, but not in 
India, where the causation is the other way round. The results for the AGE models indicate that only 
for  South  Africa  export  diversification  has  a  positive  impact  on  economic  development  (GDP, 
employment  and  household  consumption)  while  for  the  remaining  countries  it  is  the  export 
specialization that was found to have a positive impact on the economic activity.   
 
Cheng et al. (2007) investigate the increasing role of the BRICS as the largest global economic 
group pointing out for the problems faced by these countries in terms of obstacles for doing business 
and a  lack  of  long-term  conditions to promote and  improve  economic  growth.  Chen  &  Lombaerde 
(2014)  in  examining  the  relationship  between  globalization  and  regionalization  of  the  BRICS 
emphasizes how integration in the global economy, associated to a higher degree of trade openness, is 
related  to  integration  in  the  regional  economy.  The  empirical  results  suggest  that  the  relative 
globalization of the BRICs is related to more global sourcing by the BRICs, improvement in regional 
competitiveness of the BRICs, and more asymmetry and trade dependence when considering regional 
trade partners.  
 
Ying et al. (2015) investigate export competitiveness of products based on high technology for 
the BRIC countries in the U.S. market and found that these countries have comparative advantages. 
Investments  in R&D and patents  have a positive relation to U.S. export of high tech products. The 
authors argue that foreign direct investment (FDI) does not directly promote export competitiveness. 
 
A  recent  paper  from  Kocourek  (2015)  analyzes  the  issue  of  exports  as  a  relevant  factor of 
structural changes for the BRICS using data from 1995 to 2012 and calculates the individual shares of 
nine major industries on the value added and on exports for each country. The main empirical evidence 
is that there was a  shift from primary manufacturing and from production of merchandise with low 
added  value,  to  more  sophisticated  goods  and  in  the  majority  of  sectors  the  driving  force  of  the 
structural  change  is  associated  to  the  domestic  customers.  Foreign  demand  plays  a  crucial  role  on 
4 

 

industry output of other sectors such as mining, quarrying and manufacturing. There is no significant 
impact of exports  for construction, financial  intermediation, real estate, renting, and other business 
activities. 
 
Bojnec et al. (2014) examine the relation between the BRIC agricultural exports and the quality 
of institutions (legal structure and security of property rights and freedom to international trade) using 
a  gravity  trade  model  and  panel  data  analysis  for  1998  to  2009.  The  empirical  results  indicate  an 
increase in agriculture food exports from Brazil and China while Russia faced a pattern of stagnation 
and high volatility. Brazil and India increased their market shares in the importing markets and there 
was a deterioration of these shares for Russia. Exports of agriculture food are positively associated to 
institutional quality and GDP and there is a negative association with market distance.  
 
As  one  can  see  based  on  the  previous  review  of  empirical  studies,  there  is  quite  a  lot  of 
differences when evaluating the role of exchange rate volatility, price (exchange rate level) and foreign 
income for export performance, which can be considered expected to some extent, since each of the 
BRICS countries has its own historical, economic, political and social specificities. The role of each 
one of these variables can also vary when considering different time periods for each country but in 
general it is fair to say that these emerging economies growth strategies, in part explained by export 
performance, will be affected by price (exchange rate level and volatility) and income effects. There is 
also  an  additional  concern  to  incorporate  international  movements  in  commodity  prices  into  the 
investigation since exports from the BRICS are still heavily concentrated on commodities, and this is 
part of our empirical task.

Data and Econometric Approach 

estimated for the period ranging from January 2000 to December 2014:  

In order to investigate the export performance of the BRICS countries the following equation is 

(cid:1838)(cid:1831)(cid:1850)(cid:1842)(cid:3047)=(cid:2010)(cid:2868)+(cid:2010)(cid:2869)(cid:1848)(cid:1841)(cid:1838)(cid:1827)(cid:1846)(cid:3047)+(cid:2010)(cid:2870)(cid:1838)(cid:1844)(cid:1831)(cid:1831)(cid:1844)(cid:3047)+(cid:2010)(cid:2871)(cid:1838)(cid:1849)(cid:1835)(cid:1839)(cid:1842)(cid:3047)+(cid:2010)(cid:2872)(cid:1838)(cid:1842)(cid:1829)(cid:1841)(cid:1839)(cid:3047)+(cid:2013)(cid:3047)                   (1) 

where:  

 LEXP:  Log of Exports (US$ Millions) - (Source: DOTS). 
 LREER:  Log of Real Effective Exchange Rate (2005 = 100) - (Source: BIS). 
 VOLAT:  Real Effective Exchange Rate Volatility - (Source: BIS). 
 LWIMP:  Log of World Imports (US$ Millions) - (Source: DOTS). 
  LPCOM: Log of Commodity Price Index – Emerging Market Economies (2010 = 100)  

  (Source: The World Bank). 

It is worth mentioning the following: i) ‘L’ indicates that the variables are in natural log form; 
ii)  the  volatility  of  the  real  effective  exchange  rates  of  each  country  was  calculated  via  ARCH-
GARCH models; iii) world imports are used as proxy for international demand for exports; iv) exports 
and real effective exchange rate (level and volatility) refer to each country analyzed; v) the commodity 
price index refers to the index related to developing and emerging economies. 

The  empirical  analysis  developed  in  this  work  is  based  on  Autoregressive  Distributed  Lag 
(ARDL)  models  applied  to  cointegration, as  proposed  in  Pesaran  &  Shin (1999)  and  Pesaran  et  al. 
(2001). These models were chosen due to their advantage over the cointegration tests in non-stationary 
variables,  such  the  ones  developed  by  Engle  and  Granger  (1987),  Phillips  &  Hansen  (1990)  and 
Johansen (1991), as well as over traditional VAR models. ARDL models applied to cointegration also 
tend to be more efficient to capture the long-term relationship data in small samples, and they perform 
well  irrespective  of  whether  variables  are  stationary  I(0),  non-stationary  I(1),  or  even    mutually 
cointegrated. (Pesaran & Shin, 1999).  

(cid:1877)(cid:3047)=(cid:2009)(cid:2868)+(cid:2012)(cid:2869)(cid:1877)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)+…+(cid:2012)(cid:3046)(cid:1877)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:3046)+(cid:2010)(cid:2869)(cid:1876)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)+ … +(cid:2010)(cid:3046)(cid:1876)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:3046)+(cid:2013)(cid:3047)  

A traditional ARDL model with two variables can be defined as: 

                (2) 

5 

 

Before the estimation of an ARDL model applied to cointegration, it is important to make sure 
that  no  variable  in  the  empirical  model  is  I(2)3.  Having  had  this  confirmation,  a  typical  Error 
Correction Model (ARDL-ECM) can estimated by the following specification: 

Δ(cid:1877)(cid:3047)=(cid:2009)(cid:2868)+(cid:2012)(cid:2869)(cid:1877)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)+(cid:2012)(cid:2870)(cid:1876)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)+∑ (cid:2038)(cid:2869)∆(cid:1877)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:3036)

+∑ (cid:2038)(cid:2870)∆(cid:1876)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:3036)+
(cid:3041)(cid:3036)(cid:2880)(cid:2868)

(cid:2013)(cid:3047)  

(cid:3041)(cid:3036)(cid:2880)(cid:2868)

          (3) 

Before  going  any  further  with  estimations  related  to  short  and  long  run  dynamics,  it  is 
important  to  check  the  performance  of  the  ARDL  estimates  through  some  diagnostic  tests.  These 
include an autocorrelation LM test and a stability test of the estimated regressions over time. As usual, 
the LM test statistics for residual serial correlation (H0 = no serial correlation) up to the specified order 
is performed by the estimation of an auxiliary estimation of the residuals on the original RHS variables 
and the  lagged  residual (in  our  case,  12 lags are used).    As  for stability  tests, the cumulative  sum 
(CUSUM) and the cumulative sum of squared (CUSUMSQ) recursive residuals tests (Brown, Durbin 
& Evans, 1975) allow us to look at the constancy of the coefficients in a model. Parameter instability is 
found if the cumulative sum falls outside the area between the two 5% critical lines. This is crucial in 
ARDL  estimations  once  the  CUSUM  and  CUSUMSQ  are  also  able  to  diagnose  the  influence  of 
structural breaks in the estimations.  

Once the researcher has made sure that the model estimated has no serial correlation problem 
and that it  is dynamically stable, the ARDL-Bounds testing methodology can be applied in order to 
confirm that the variables in the model cointegrate, that is, they have a long run relationship. Pesaran’s 
Bounds  testing  is  a  Wald  test  (F-test)  to  check  the  joint  significance  of  the  model’s  long-term 

parameters.  However,  under  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  cointegration ((cid:1834)(cid:2868): (cid:2012)(cid:2869)=(cid:2012)(cid:2870)=0),  the  critical 

values of the Wald test have no standard asymptotic distribution for any order of integration of the 
regressors. As a result, Pesaran et al. (2001) provide bounds on the critical values for the F statistics, 
where  the  lower  level  is  calculated  on  the  assumption  that  all  variables  of  the  model  are  ARDL 
stationary  and,  therefore,  there  is  no  cointegration,  whereas  the  upper  bound  is  calculated  on  the 
assumption  that  all  variables  are  I(1),  that  is,  there  is  cointegration.  Finally,  an  F-statistic  falling 
between the bounds means that the test is inconclusive.  

Once such relationship is confirmed, the long-run equilibrium coefficients can be estimated, as 
well as the ECM itself, which provides the long-term balance adjustment speed.  In fact, the ARDL 
model is able to keep information on both short and long run properties of the estimated model, and 
disequilibrium is seen as a process of adjustment to the long run.

As  already  mentioned,  if  the  cointegration  test  statistics  falls  between  the  critical  values 
calculated by Pesaran et al. (2001), it is necessary to know the order of integration of variables to reject 
the  null  hypothesis.  Thus,  we  ran  the  following  unit  root  tests:  Augmented  Dickey-Fuller  (ADF), 
Phillips-Perron  (PP),  Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin  (KPSS)  and  the  Modified  Dickey-Fuller 
Test  (DF-GLS).  As  Table  1  makes  clear,  the  results  related  to  some  variables  are  inconclusive, 
especially those related to exports and real effective  exchange rate  volatility. Therefore, this  makes 
ARDL modelling and bounds testing applicable. 

In order to run the ARDL models, we allow each estimation to go up to the 6 lags and the best 
model for each country is selected according to the Akaike Bayesian Criteria (AIC). The order of the 
variables for each ARDL model is as follows: Log of Exports, Log of Real Effective Exchange Rate, 
Real Effective Exchange Rate Volatility, Log of World Imports and Log of Commodity Price Index. 
Table 2 reports the ARDL models, along with the autocorrelation LM test for each country analyzed. It 
is clear that the lags chosen for each variable vary amongst BRICS countries. In the case of Brazil and 
China , lagged ‘exports’ seem to play an important role, as 6 lags were chosen. As for Russia, ‘world

imports’  is  the  variable  with  more  lags  chosen,  whilst  in  India  the  ‘volatility  of  the  real  effective 
exchange rate’ is the variable with more lags chosen. 

In order to go on with the analysis regarding long-run and short-run dynamics of the BRICS 
export performance,  we must decide whether the  models estimated are  suitable for further analysis. 
Therefore, some diagnostic tests are needed. Table 2 also reports the Autocorrelation LM Test for each 
of  the  ARDL  model  chosen.  It  is  clear  that  able  vary  among  BRICS  countries,  and  all  estimated 
models are free from serial correlation problems.4 As for the CUSUM and the CUSUMSQ stability 
tests, which are reported in the appendix, show that there is some parameter instability in the case of 
China and South Africa. Russia also shows some instability, but very little.

We now turn to the examination of the existence of cointegration vectors between the variables, 
by applying the ARDL Bounds Testing Approach, as in Pesaran et al. (2001). Table 3 reports these 
results,  taking  into  account  Pesaran’s  et  al.  (2001)  critical  values.  The  null  hypothesis  of  “no 
cointegration  vectors”  can  be  rejected  (at  5%)  for  all  Brazil,  Russia,  India  and  China,  once  the  F-
statistics are greater than Pesaran’s critical values. As for South Africa, the long run relationship can 
only be detected at 10%. But we have to remember that there is considerable parameter instability in 
the South African case. Overall, it means that there is a long run relationship between the variables 
analyzed for each country-member of the BRICS group, with an exception of South Africa.

After applying the ARDL Bounds Testing Approach to all models, we estimate the long-run 
equilibrium coefficients, which are reported in Table 4. The empirical results suggest the existence of 
asymmetries among countries, when considering which variables are playing a significant role in the 
long run. Let’s focus on each country separately: 
 

Brazil: export performance relies mainly on foreign demand and commodity prices. These two 
factors  point  to  one  major  importer  of  Brazilian  goods,  which  is  China.  Brazil  took  great 
advantage of the considerable Chinese economic growth in the past few years and exported high 
quantities of agriculture and metal commodities, such as soybeans and related soy products, and 
iron ore.  
Russia: export performance relies on real effective exchange rate (level and volatility), foreign 
demand  and  commodity  prices.  Russia  is  a  major  exporter of  commodities  such as  crude oil, 
petroleum goods and  natural  gas, which account for about half of the country´s  exports.  This 
explains why our ARDL model selected the above mentioned variables.  
India:  export  performance  relies  on  real  effective  exchange  rate  (level  and  volatility)  and 
commodity prices. Gems and precious metals, petroleum products, service goods, automobiles 
and machinery are the main products exported by India.  
China: export performance relies on real effective exchange rate and foreign demand. There is 
no doubt China is one of the fastest growing economy for the past decades, relying mainly on its 
exports around the world. In order to have such performance, the control of exchange rate (kept 
constantly at a competitive level for exports) is of utmost importance, as well as a strong foreign 
demand.    But one  must  remember  that  there  is  considerable  parameter  instability  in  China´s 
ARDL model. 
South Africa: export performance relies on foreign demand. South Africa´s export products are 
mainly mineral products, precious metals, iron and steel products and vehicles. As in the case of 
China,  South  Africa  also  shows  considerable  parameter  instability  in  the  estimated  ARDL 
model.

Notes: All variables are in natural log except for REER Volatility. Commodity Price Index 

is related to developing countries.  

The next question to be asked is related to the short run adjustment, via an Error Correction 
Representation (ECM) of the ARDL models. In fact, as long as there is long-run equilibrium, any short 
run disequilibrium can be seen as a process of adjustment to the long run. It means that we have to 
know  whether  this  speed  of  adjustment  is  fast  or  slow.  Table  5  reports  the  ECM  results  for  the 
estimated  ARDL  models.  As  expected,  the  error-correction  term  (ECMt-1)  is  negative  for  all 
estimations performed (on average ECMt-1 = -0.56). It means that, on average, 56% of the shock is 
corrected  after  the  first  month.  The  lowest  speed  of  adjustment  is  found  in  South  Africa  (23%), 
meaning that, for the South African case, the long-run equilibrium relationship between its variables 
returns  to  the  steady  state  very  slowly.  But,  again,  one  must  remember  that  South  Africa  shows  a 
substantial  parameter  instability  and  its  long  run  equilibrium  is  not  as  significant  as  in  the  other 
countries analyzed. On the other  hand, the  highest speed of adjustment  is  associated to the case of 
China (87%), followed by Brazil (81%), that is, in these two countries the adjustment process, towards 
the long-run equilibrium, is quite fast.

Conclusion 

 
The main goal of this work is to investigate the export performance for Brazil, Russia, India, 
China  and  South  Africa  (BRICS)  from  January  2000  to  December  2014  using  autoregressive 
distributed lag (ARDL) models in order to test for the existence of cointegration. The variables used 
are  exports,  real  effective  exchange  rate  (level  and  volatility),  world  imports  (proxy  for  foreign 
demand) and commodity prices.  

We  were  able to  reject  the  null  of  no long  run  relationship  for  each  country,  indicating  the 
existence of cointegration among the variables used in our empirical analysis. The empirical results 
suggest that in the long run, export performance relies mainly on real effective exchange rate (level 
and  volatility)  and  foreign  demand  (China  and  Russia),  foreign  demand  and  commodity  prices 
(Brazil),  real  effective  exchange  rate  and  commodity  prices  (India)  and  on  foreign  demand  (South 
Africa).
