Abstract 
The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  analyse  the  impact  of  long-term  university-industry 
collaboration  on  academic  research  productivity.  Empirical  evidence  shows  that  in 
general,  collaboration with  industry positively affects scientific productivity. However, 
there  is  a  lack  of  understanding  of  the  long-term  effect  of  collaboration.  This  paper 
addresses  that  concern  through  the  use  of  a  unique  longitudinal  and  comprehensive 
dataset on university-industry collaboration in Brazil. The results show that over the long 
term, research groups that collaborate with industry present better scientific performance, 
allowing  for  the  conclusion  that  long-term  collaboration  between  research  groups  and 
firms has a positive effect on academic productivity.

1. Introduction 

The  increasing  importance  of  university-industry  collaboration  has  raised 
concerns  about  the  potential  effects  that  collaboration  with  firms  has  on  academic 
productivity.  Many  studies  have  found  that  university-industry  collaboration  has  a 
positive effect on scientific productivity. However, other studies have found  either that 
the  positive  effects  are  limited  or  that  collaboration  with  industry  can  have  negative 
effects on scientific productivity. 
 
This  paper  aims  to  analyse  the  impact  of  long-term  university-industry 
collaboration  on  academic  research  productivity.  We  describe  four  main  gaps  in  the 
literature that this paper aims to fill with new contributions. First, we examine the effect 
of collaboration with industry on scientific productivity using data on university-industry 
linkages  such  as  collaborative  projects.  Previous  studies  of  the  effects  on  scientific 
productivity primarily use  formal channels of interactions such as patents, licences and 
spin-offs. Data on collaboration with industry presents several advantages  over data on 
collaborative project-based links with industry such as patents, licences and spin-offs. For 
firms and universities, collaboration projects with industry are both more widespread and 
more important for technology transfer (D’Este & Patel 2007; Cohen et al. 2002; Agrawal 
& Henderson 2002; Banal-Estañol et al. 2015).

Second,  we  present  new  findings  on  both  the  long-term  effect  of  collaboration 
with industry on scientific productivity and the empirical evidence on how collaboration 
with  industry  affects  scientific  production  over  time.  Third,  our  results  show  that  the 
benefits of collaboration with industry decrease over time, revealing that those benefits 
could not be unlimited. No previous studies have found this non-linear relation between 
collaboration with industry and scientific production over time. Fourth, previous studies 
on the effects of collaboration with  industry on scientific production  primarily  focused 
on developed countries, whereas this paper focuses on Brazil, a developing country. 

The  data  used  in  this  paper  comprise  a  unique  longitudinal  and  comprehensive 
database  of  university-industry  collaboration  in  Brazil  from  the  Census  of  Research 
Groups Directory in the Lattes database of the Ministry of Science and Technology. Data 
from  2002  to  2008  not  only  distinguish  collaborative  and  non-collaborative  research 
groups  but  also  provide  information  about  those  groups’  characteristics  and  scientific 
performance. As  in developed countries, academic research plays an  increasing role  in 
fostering innovation in developing countries (De Fuentes & Dutrénit 2012; Ranga et al. 
2016)  such  as  Brazil  (Albuquerque  2007;  Suzigan  et  al.  2009;  Fernandes  et  al.  2010; 
Moraes-Silva  et  al.  2017).  Brazilian  universities  are  playing  a  more  prominent  role  in 
fostering innovation in several industries, with  a notable impact on the share of several 
domestic  firms  in  international  markets  (Suzigan  &  Albuquerque  2011).  However,  the 
experiences  of  developing  countries’ 
less-developed  institutional  and  economic 
environments suggest that university-industry collaborations could have different natures 
and  determinants  in  developing  countries  than  in  developed  countries  (Albuquerque 
2007;  Moraes-Silva  et  al.  2017).  For  example,  unlike  in  developed  countries,  in 
developing countries  the  most important  areas  in which technology transfer occurs are 
engineering  and  agrarian  sciences  (Suzigan  et  al.  2009).  University  research  is 
particularly  important  to  medium-  and  lower-technology  industries  because  Brazilian 
firms’ research and development (R&D) expenditures are relatively low, particularly in 
high-technology  industries  (Albuquerque  2007;  Suzigan  et  al.  2009).  The  regional 
distribution of university-industry  linkages  is  strongly unequal and concentrated in the 
southern part of the country (Garcia et al. 2015).  

Our empirical  strategy for estimating the effect of long-term university-industry 
collaborations  in  the  scientific  production  of  research  groups  involves  a  difference-in-
differences  (DID)  approach  with  a  matching  technique  based  on  Propensity  Score 
Matching (PSM). The use of PSM in conjunction with DID reduces potential selection 
bias in the sampling. 

This  paper  is  organized  into  four  sections.  Section  two  presents  the  conceptual 
background  of  the  effects  of  collaboration  on  scientific  productivity.  Section  three 
provides a brief description of the dataset  and the main  methodological  issues. Section 
four  presents  the  results  and  discusses  the  main  evidence  for  the  long-term  effects  of 
collaboration  with  industry  on  scientific  production.  Section  five  presents  concluding 
remarks and policy implications. 
 
2.  University-industry  collaboration  and  scientific  productivity:  positive  and 
negative effects 

The increasing importance of university-industry collaboration over the last two 
decades has raised several concerns about the potential effects of collaboration with firms 
on academic productivity. The university’s role in fostering innovation has been widely 
recognized, and university-industry collaboration is an important mean for academic and 
industrial R&D researchers to share knowledge (Cohen et al. 2002; Mowery & Sampat 
2009).

From  the  university’s  perspective,  collaboration  raises  important  concerns.  The 
economic benefits of collaboration could shift academic researchers’ orientation, driving 
them  away  from  basic  research  and  harming  academic  productivity  (Merton  1976; 
Dasgupta & David 1994; Breschi et al. 2008; Tartari & Breschi 2012). Collaboration can 
have  several  potentially  damaging  effects  on  academic  researchers’  behaviour  by 
weakening their commitment to the principles of open science and stimulating adverse 
behaviours such as data withholding, secrecy and publication delays (Dasgupta & David 
1994; Merton 1976). Academic researchers’ work is based on the principles of research 
autonomy and the wide dissemination of newly generated knowledge, and their incentive 
systems are  based on reputation and  peer  recognition  (Nelson 2004; Tartari & Breschi 
2012; Merton 1976; Dasgupta & David 1994). Industrial scientists seek the  benefits of 
the  use  of  private  knowledge  to  generate  new  or  improved  products  and  processes. 
Industrial research aims for short-term results derived from the commercialization of new 
knowledge,  which  requires  proprietary  technologies  and  the  limited  exchange  of 
information  and  knowledge  (Tartari  et  al.  2012;  Rosenberg  1990;  Dasgupta  &  David 
1994; Perkmann & Walsh 2009). 

Collaboration with industry can  benefit academic research in several ways. The 
main  benefits  might  be  economic,  such  as  financial  resources  for  the  research  group 
access to costly labs and other materials; or benefits such as the exchange of information 
and  knowledge  sharing  between  academic  researchers  and  industrial  scientists.  (Arza 
2010; Perkmann & Walsh 2009). Collaboration with industry can provide closer contacts 
between industrial scientists and academic researchers and can be a crucial source of new 
ideas. Thus, collaboration can have positive effects on generating new ideas for research 
projects  and  upgrading  the  academic  research  agenda  (Breschi  et  al.  2008;  Tartari  & 
Breschi 2012). 

With  respect  to  collaborations  between  industrial  scientists  and  academic 
researchers, various studies have made claims about how collaboration affects scientific 
productivity (Landry et al. 1996; Blumenthal et al. 1996; Bozeman et al. 2013; Lee 2000; 
Agrawal  & Henderson 2002). However, empirical  studies  have  found  mixed evidence. 
Many  studies  have  found  a  positive  relationship  between  university-industry 
collaboration and scientific productivity (Ranga et al. 2003; Van Looy et al. 2011; Rivera-
Huerta et al. 2011; Banal-Estañol et al. 2013; Van Looy et al. 2004; Abramo et al. 2009; 
Lee & Bozeman 2005; Landry et al. 1996; Tartari & Breschi 2012; Steinmo 2015). Some 
studies have noted that positive effects only occur under specific conditions (Bonaccorsi 
et al. 2006; Manjarrés-Henríquez et al. 2009; Banal-Estañol et al. 2013), whereas others 
have found that collaboration can have negative effects on scientific productivity ( 
 
Manjarrés-Henríquez et al. 2009; Banal-Estañol et al. 2015). 

In  general,  the  positive  effects  of  collaboration  with  industry  are  related  to 
academic benefits that emerge from the collaboration because linkages with industry can 
expand and upgrade the academic research agenda. Economic benefits, especially access 
to  financial  and  non-financial  resources,  have  also  been  mentioned  (Tartari  &  Breschi 
2012; Banal-Estañol et al. 2015). However, these positive effects are often only apparent 
if  the  university  research  group  develops  R&D  contracts  with  its  industrial  partner 
(Manjarrés-Henríquez et al. 2009). The amount of  funds obtained  for the collaboration 
also affects the positive effects. Previous studies have found that when the total resources 
from  collaboration  are  greater  than  15%  of  a  research  group’s  total  budget,  the 
collaboration negatively affects scientific productivity (Manjarrés-Henríquez et al. 2008). 
A curvilinear inverted U-shape curve between the degree of collaboration and scientific 
productivity has also been found (Banal-Estañol et al. 2015). Collaborative projects with 
industry  can  enhance  academic  research  projects  and  consequently,  research  output 

 

3 

because  such  projects  can  provide  new  ideas  and  funding  for  academic  research. 
However, a high degree of collaboration can damage research publication because new 
ideas might be of lower value, industry can impose disclosure conditions, or collaborative 
projects  could  reduce  the  potential  for  academic  research,  creating  time-management 
problems (Banal-Estañol et al. 2015). This line of argument leads to the following testable 
hypothesis: 
 

H1:  University-industry  collaborations  increase  the  scientific  productivity  of 
academic research groups.  

 

It  is  important  to  note  the  long-term  effects  of  collaboration  with  industry  on 
scientific productivity. The benefits of collaboration with industry can occur with greater 
intensity over the long term, when different and powerful interaction mechanisms act to 
reduce  orientation  barriers  related  to  differences  in  universities  and  businesses’ 
orientation and transaction barriers related to intellectual property conflicts and contract 
management  (Bruneel  et  al.  2010;  Tartari  et  al.  2012;  Perkmann  &  Walsh  2009;  Arza 
2010; Dutrénit et al. 2010; Rivera-Huerta et al. 2011; Lee 2000; Lee & Bozeman 2005). 
Partners’ increasing experience in collaboration, the breadth of interactive projects, and 
the creation of mutual trust between the partners are the primary factors that lower barriers 
to  collaboration  over  time  (Cantner  et  al.  2017;  Rivera-Huerta  et  al.  2011).  Another 
testable hypothesis can be stated:  
 

H2: Long-term collaborations with industry increase the scientific productivity of 
academic research groups.  

 

The second hypothesis is the most important because it fills a gap in the literature 
related  to  a  lack  of  understanding  of  how  long-term  university-industry  collaboration 
affects scientific productivity. In this paper, we provide new empirical evidence on this 
issue. 
 

3. Database  
3.1. Methodological Approach 

In our research design, we apply a DID approach to assess the impact of academic 
collaboration with industry on the university research groups’ scientific production and 
compare  them  with  the  production  of  other  academic  research  groups  that  do  not 
collaborate  with  industry.  This  method  is  widely  used  in  econometric  studies  (Card  & 
Krueger 1994; Heckman et al. 1998) and is based on a quasi-experimental research design 
that compares the mean value of a dependent variable over time between treatment and 
control groups. After an initial period, the treatment group is subject to an intervention 
that does not occur in the control group.  

The DID method generally eliminates problems of selection bias associated with 
single-population time series or static comparisons because the inference is made using 
the  same  observation  across  time.  When  panel  data  are  available,  they  are  useful  for 
inferring the effect of a certain treatment. However, DID assumes that the treatment and 
control  groups  are  similar  before  the  treatment.  The  composition  of  the  sample  could 
generate potential biases in the DID method. The most common problem is related to the 
fact  that  the  treatment  group  is  not  random  and  could  present  self-selection  issues, 
generating a group that is different from the general population. 

To  manage  this  potential  selection  bias  and  for  a  more  accurate  DID  analysis, 
covariate matching techniques focused on reducing the difference between the covariate 

4 

 

distributions  for treatment  and  control  groups  can  be  used.  Matching  techniques  add  a 
more  fine-grained  comparison  between  the  two  samples,  ensuring  similarity  and  thus 
improving comparability (Rubin 1980).  The matching technique is PSM (Rubin 1976), 
which focuses on reducing bias across simultaneous covariates and is a widely used and 
accepted method for drawing causal estimates of effect size (Dehejia & Wahba 2002).  

It  is  built  by  matching  research  groups  of  treated  and  non-treated  samples  that 
present  similar  propensity  scores,  estimated  by  a  logit  or  probit  model  considering 
observable pre-treatment covariates. In regards to university-industry collaboration, there 
are some characteristics of the research groups, such as staff qualification, team size, age, 
scientific field, affiliation and location, which can affect collaboration with industry. The 
PSM procedure reduces both the imbalance between the treatment and the control groups 
and the selection bias, resulting in a more precise estimation.  

Combining  DID  and  PSM  is  a  powerful  method  to  estimate  treatment  effects 
(Heckman et al. 1998). DID controls for unobserved heterogeneity between treated and 
non-treated  research  groups.  The  PSM  matching  technique  controls  selection  bias, 
avoiding treated and non-treated groups of different compositions. In this paper, we use 
two DID methods, standard DID and DID with PSM, allowing us both to interpret results 
across different estimations and to generate more robust results.  
 
3.2 Assembly of the Dataset 

Data  on  university-industry  collaborations  in  Brazil  were  gathered  from  the 
Census of Research Groups Directory of the Ministry of Science and Technology’s Lattes 
database. The Census  covers  two-year basis  information; we used data from the 2002, 
2004, 2006 and 2008 editions. The database provides comprehensive information from 
8,053 academic research groups in Brazil,  providing  information  for all editions of the 
Census. The information comprises the main characteristics of academic research groups 
such  as  institutional  affiliation,  scientific  field,  number  of  researchers,  scientific 
publications, location and collaboration with industry. 

The target population covers all research groups that provide information  for all 
editions of the Census. The database  is  longitudinal and comprehensive, with research 
groups in all scientific fields and all regions of the country; it includes public and private 
universities  and  Public  Research  Institution  (PRI).  We  removed  research  groups  that 
collaborated  in  the  initial  period  (2002)  because  the  DID  method  assumes  that  the 
treatment  and  control  groups  were  not  previously  exposed  to  the  treatment.  This 
procedure ensures that we are comparing the effect of collaboration with industry on the 
scientific  production  of  research  groups  that  started  a  new  collaboration  during  the 
treatment period against research groups that did not collaborate during the same period. 
The  final  dataset  is  composed  of  7,572  academic  research  groups.  It  includes 
information  on  research  groups’  basic  characteristics,  such  as  size,  the  researchers’ 
qualifications,  age,  scientific  field,  region,  institutional  affiliation,  and  scientific 
production. On average, each research group had 4 Ph.D. researchers and published 38.6 
articles in the two years before the 2002 census. Among the 7,572 research groups, 857 
(11.3%) collaborated with  industry  at least in once  during the  studied  period.  Of those 
research groups, 324 (4.3% of the sample) collaborated over the entire period, except for 
the initial year. In our context, collaborations represent the treatment given to individuals 
(i.e.,  academic  research  groups),  whereas  the  control  research  groups  are  non-treated 
individuals. To evaluate the effect of such a treatment, we used DID. 

Table  1  presents  the  main  variable  of  the  final  dataset,  Table  2  presents  the 
descriptive statistics and Table 3 presents the sample of collaborating research groups and 
the population of non-collaborating research groups.

We conducted PSM using Kernel-based matching in a logit model. The means of 
each pre-treatment covariate for the treatment (i.e., the matched and unmatched control 
groups) are summarized  in Table 4. It  is possible to  ensure that there is no statistically 
significant difference between the treatment and control groups after PSM.

4. Results and discussion 

We estimated an econometric model to empirically test the two hypotheses: 
H1:  University-industry  collaborations  increase  the  scientific  productivity  of 
academic research groups.  
H2: Long-term collaborations with industry increase the scientific productivity of 
academic research groups. 
Two  different  econometric  approaches  were  used  to  estimate  the  effects  of 
collaboration with industry. First, we estimated using standard unmatched DID. Second, 
we estimated using DID with PSM, which allows  us  to estimate the regression  for the 
entire  sample of treated and control  research groups.  The results of the estimations are 
presented in Table 5. 

 

Table 5 about here. 

 
In  both  cases,  the  estimated  effect  is  both  positive  and  significant.  The  second 
estimation includes the PSM and allows us to note the effect of each collaboration in the 
number  of  papers  published  by  each  academic  research  group.  The  findings  show that 
although the DID-PSM estimated effects are lower than the effects of the standard DID, 
they have higher statistical significance. 

The  results  are  presented  by  sorting  out  long-term  collaborations.  Long-term 
collaboration is defined as research groups that collaborate with industry over the entire 
period  analysed.  Thus, the  first estimation shows the effect of the collaboration on  the 
scientific productivity of all research groups that collaborate with industry, even though 
that  collaboration  may  have occurred  during only a single  year of the analysed period. 
The second estimation shows only long-term collaborations. 

Considering all collaborations, the findings show that collaboration with industry 
generally  has  a  positive  effect  on  scientific  productivity.  The  effect  of  collaboration 
represents an increase in scientific production of 5.832 papers per research group over the 
entire period. When comparing this result to the control group, the effect of collaboration 
implies  an  increase  of  12.8%  in  the  scientific  production  of  the  collaborating  research 
groups.  This  finding  supports  hypothesis  H1  and  corroborates  the  results  of  previous 
studies  finding  that  both  technology  transfer  from  universities  to  industry  and 
collaboration  with  firms  have  positive  effects  on  scientific  productivity  (Landry  et  al. 
1996; Van Looy et al. 2004; Abramo et al. 2009; Banal-Estañol et al. 2015). 

The positive effects of  long-term collaboration are even greater. The difference 
between the effects of scientific production is an increase of 7.141 published papers of 
the long-term collaborating research groups, which means 15.4% more than the control 
group. This finding supports hypothesis H2 and represents new empirical evidence on the 

 

6 

effects  of  long-term  collaboration  with  industry.  Previous  studies  noted  that  the 
experience of collaboration with  industry  lowers orientation and transaction barriers to 
collaboration  over  time  because  it  promotes  a  better  understanding  between  academic 
researchers  and  industrial  scientists  and  increases  mutual  trust  (Bruneel  et  al.  2010; 
Rivera-Huerta  et  al.  2011;  Tartari  et  al.  2012;  Perkmann  &  Walsh  2009;  Arza  2010; 
Dutrénit  et  al.  2010;  Lee  2000;  Lee  &  Bozeman  2005).  However,  there  is  a  lack  of 
empirical evidence of the long-term effects of the engagement with industry. This finding 
represents a  new contribution regarding empirical evidence  of  the effects of  long-term 
collaboration  with  industry  on  scientific  production.  This  shows  that  long-term 
collaborative research projects positively affect the scientific production of collaborative 
research groups in comparison with non-collaborative ones. 

As a robustness check to ensure that our DID results are not sensitive to alternative 
PSM  specifications,  we  performed  estimations  using  five  different  PSM  approaches, 
varying the kernel type, bandwidth and estimation technique. The main results remain the 
same  (Table  6).  Research  groups  that  began  to  collaborate  had  a  better  scientific 
performance  in  2008.  Moreover,  the  effects  on  academic  publication  are  stronger  for 
long-term  collaborations  than  for  short-term  ones.  To  illustrate  this  disparity,  we 
subtracted the short-term effects from the long-term effects (in the bottom row of Table 
6). This shows that long-term collaboration’s effect on academic production ranges from 
1.248 to 2.060 additional publications on the tested different PSM approaches.

The positive effects of collaboration with industry on scientific productivity can 
also be analysed  by examining  how  these effects  evolve over time. To do  so, separate 
DID specifications were estimated for the 2002-04, 2002-06 and 2002-08 periods using 
only research groups that engaged in long-term collaboration. This specification enables 
us  to  examine  the  degree  of  the  effects  of  collaboration  with  industry  on  a  research 
group’s scientific production for each period analysed. This allows us to analyse the trend 
in the research group’s scientific production (Table 7). 

 
Table 7 about here. 
 
In the first analysed period (2002-04), the effects are quite small—1.536 published 
papers  per  collaborating  research  group—and  have  no  statistical  significance.  This 
finding indicates that the main benefits of collaboration with industry occur over time and 
could be quite small in the short term. In the second period (2002-06), the positive effects 
of  collaboration  are  statistically  significant  and  show  an  increase  of  5.038  papers  per 
collaborative research group. For the entire period (2002-08), positive effects can be seen, 
but  the  increase  occurs  at  a  lower  rate,  representing  an  increase  of  7.141  papers  per 
research  group.  This  finding  indicates  that  there  may  not  be  an  unlimited  increase  in 
research  groups’  scientific  production  because  they  cannot  afford  larger  increases  in 
publication.  This  result  means  that  long-term  collaboration  with  industry  has  strong 
positive effects on a research group’s scientific production. However, these effects have 
limits, which are related to the characteristics of each research group. 
 
5. Final remarks and policy implications 

There is controversy regarding the effects of university-industry collaboration on 
scientific productivity. Some studies emphasize the benefits of collaboration, focusing on 
the opportunity to benefit from industrial scientists’ complementary capabilities (Landry 

 

7 

et al. 1996; Geuna & Nesta 2006; Breschi et al. 2007; Abramo et al. 2009; Banal-Estañol 
et  al.  2015;  Dutrénit  et  al.  2010).  Other  studies  note  the  limits  of  the  benefits  of 
collaboration  with  industry  (Bonaccorsi  et  al.  2006;  Manjarrés-Henríquez  et  al.  2008; 
Banal-Estañol et al. 2015). 

This  paper  aims  to  present  new  empirical  evidence  of  the  long-term  effect  of 
collaboration with industry on scientific production by examining this issue in relation to 
collaborative projects involving academic research and industrial R&D groups in Brazil. 
The  empirical  strategy  involves  DID  and  PSM  to  compare  collaborative  and  non-
collaborative  research  groups.  Three  main  contributions  are  noted.  First,  in  agreement 
with  previous  studies,  collaboration  with  industry  has  positive  effects  on  scientific 
productivity because research groups that collaborate with industry publish more papers 
than research groups that do not. Second, over the long term, the effects of collaboration 
tend to  be higher  because  the difference  in scientific production  between collaborative 
and non-collaborative research groups tends to be higher over time. Third, there are limits 
to the positive effects of collaboration over time  because the empirical evidence shows 
that the increase in benefits attributable to a long-term collaboration occurs at a decreasing 
rate.  

Finally, these findings have policy implications. Several studies noted that policies 
of stimulating  stimulate university-industry linkages play a role  in fostering innovation 
(Dasgupta & David 1994; Cohen et al. 2002; Albuquerque 2007). This paper’s findings 
reinforce the role of policy from the standpoint of academic research because university 
research  groups  benefit  from  collaboration  with  industry,  especially  from  long-term 
collaborative projects. Policies should include requirements for academic researchers to 
publish new papers related to their collaboration projects because academic researchers 
must  be  able  to  create  mechanisms  to  benefit  from  the  complementary  capabilities  of 
industrial  scientists  with  whom  they  collaborate. This  will  allow  academic  researchers 
and industrial scientists to strengthen the generation and dissemination of new scientific 
and technological knowledge. Moreover, because the long-term benefits of collaboration 
are  higher  than  the  short-term  benefits,  policy  should  establish  mechanisms  that 
encourage  the  maintenance  of  relationships  over  time,  especially  through  programmes 
that consider the duration of collaboration between academic researchers and industrial 
scientists.
