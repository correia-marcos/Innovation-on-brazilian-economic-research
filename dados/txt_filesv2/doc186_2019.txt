Abstract 

School electrification can decrease the gap between rural and urban education. The Brazilian 
policy  focusing  on  electricity  access  in  school  decreased  student’s  dropout  rate.  Rural 
electrification programs – like the Light for All  – have been successful to increase access to 
electricity  services  in  Brazil,  where  99.3%  of  the  population  has  access  to  it.  On  the  public 
policy  viewpoint,  the  cost-benefit  analysis  must  consider  not  only  the  direct  impact  of  the 
programs but also the positive externalities of it. In this paper, we aim to study the Light for All 
in Schools (LFAS, “Luz para Todos nas Escolas”), a program focused on providing access to 
electricity to rural schools. The study aims to measure the effect of access to electricity in rural 
schools on the dropout rate of students in primary education. Our goal is to create a dialogue 
between the studies on the benefits of electricity in vulnerable areas and the studies on education 
outcomes.  Our  results  show  that  electrification  programs,  like  the  LFAS,  have  a  significant 
effect  on  the  dropout  rate  of  rural  schools.  Schools  that  received  electricity  by  the  program 
before 2013 had an improvement of 16% in the dropout rate in 3 years, and schools that were 
treated by the program between 2013 and 2016 had an improvement of 27% in 3 years due to 
the access to electricity.

Resumo 

A eletrificação rural pode reduzir o hiato entre a educação rural e urbana. A política brasileira 
de educação rural nas escolas reduziu a taxa de abandono dos alunos. Programas de eletrificação 
rural - como o Luz para Todos - foram bem sucedidos em aumentar os serviços de eletricidade 
no Brasil, onde 99,3% da população possui acesso. Do ponto de vista das políticas, a análise de 
custo-benefício deve considerar não apenas os impactos diretos dos programas, mas também as 
externalidades positivas destes. Neste artigo, nós focamos no estudo do  Luz para Todos nas 
Escolas (LPTE), um programa voltado à provisão de eletricidade às escolas rurais. Este estudo 
busca mensurar o efeito do acesso à eletricidade nas escolas rurais sobre a taxa de abandono 
escolar na educação primária. Nosso objetivo é criar um diálogo entre os estudos que apontam 
os  benefícios  do  acesso  à  eletricidade  em  áreas  vulneráveis  e  os  estudos  sobre  desempenho 
educacional. Nossos resultados indicam que programas de eletrificação, como o LPTE, têm um 
efeito  significativo  sobre  a  taxa  de  abandono  das  escolas  rurais.  Escolas  que  receberam 
eletricidade pelo programa antes de 2013 tiveram uma melhoria de 16% na taxa de abandono 
escolar em 3 anos, e escolas que foram tratadas pelo programa entre 2013 e 2016 tiveram uma 
melhoria de 27% em 3 anos.

1.  Introduction 

The universal access to energy became one of the 17 Millennium Development Goal of the 
United Nations in 2015. Energy access was recognized as a key element for improving socio-
economic conditions in developing countries. The access of the energy services is expected to 
have a multi-dimensional impact on the potential of socio-economic development of a region, 
changing productivity, education and health. Even if this relation is intuitive, the evidence of 
the impact of energy access in the householder’s welbeing is still a challenge (see for instance, 
Bharracharyya, 2012).  

There  is  an  effort  in  the  literature  looking  to  measure  these  evidences.  For  instance, 
Dinkelman  (2011)  show  positive  impact  on  employment  for  South  Africa,  Khandker  et  al. 
(2012) shows the impact of access in the decreasing of poverty in India. Lipscomb et al. (2013) 
find evidence in Brazil of positive effects of electrification on development index by looking at 
long term trends (1960-2000). There is overall positive impact of energy access, however, great 
differences  among  cases (JIMENEZ, 2017).  To find  measurable  evidences is  relevant in  the 
process to estimate the benefices of access policies and to improve the design of these policies. 
Our  study  contributes  to  this  literature  by  showing  evidence  of  the  impact  of  school  energy 
access in rural education in Brazil.   

Electricity access in Brazil reaches 99.3% of the population OLADE (2017). Nonetheless, 
isolated  rural  areas  still  suffer  from  the  lack  of  electricity  benefits,  such  as  lighting  and 
refrigeration. This “last mile” problem excludes a small but extremely vulnerable share of the 
Brazilian population, like poor rural communities from the semi-arid region, Amazon riverside 
(also  known  as  “ribeirinhos”)  and  indigenous  communities,  and  quilombos  (century-old 
settlements founded by people of African origin who escaped from slavery). 

Education  is  important  due  to  many  reasons.  It  has  individual  and  collective 
socioeconomics benefits. It is one of the main determinants of individual income, which means 
it also has an essential role in income inequality (Belfield, 2000). Inequalities of educational 
opportunities result in income disparities due to  the small  likelihood of the poorest  reaching 
secondary  and  higher  education  (especially  the  latter),  impairing  the  reduction  of  income 
inequality (Ney, Souza and Ponciano, 2010). Promoting basic education in a country like Brazil, 
with a strong presence of inequality and poverty, is a necessary condition for the full exercise 
of citizenship and participation in a modern economy. 

Teixeira e Menezes-Filho (2012), using a Mincer equation with an instrumental variable 
approach and data from 1997 to 2007, estimate that a year of schooling in primary education 
increases  an  individual's  wage  in  5.5%  in  Brazil.  Although  this  figure  might  seem  low,  we 
should  have  in  mind  that  in  2007,  95%  of  children  aged  6  to  14  were  enrolled  in  primary 
education.1 An additional year of higher education, for instance, has a greater impact on wages.  
That being said, the mean years of schooling in the sample used by the authors is eight 
years. In 2015, the mean years of schooling for rural areas was 5.3, while in urban areas that 
figure goes up to 8.3 (PNAD, 2017).2 In addition, estimating a Mincer equation for a rural area 
is  complex  due  to  inherent  characteristics,  such  as  the  seasonal  nature  of  rural  wages. 
Considering all this, the returns to primary education in rural areas is likely higher than 5.5%. 
Since  1988,  the  Brazilian  Federal  Constitution  establishes  education  as  a  social  right 
with  universal  access  to  all  grades  of  basic  education  (primary  and  secondary  education). 
Therefore,  isolated  communities  have  the  constitutional  right  to  claim  access  to  regular 
education in a public school. However, the infrastructure of these schools is precarious (Pieri e 
Santos, 2014). These schools usually lack access to basic services, such as drinkable water and 
electricity  access.  The  absence  of  these  services  may  affect  the  daily  life  of  the  school

community, including the attainment of schools’ levels. As of 2017, 65.3% of the 16-year-old 
rural population had at least concluded primary education. While that number has steadfastly 
increased since 2012, it is still 12,7 p.p. less than the urban figure, 78% (Inep, 2018). 

Particularly, the effects of electricity on learning are directly related to the availability 
of  artificial  lighting.  The  benefits  of  it  are  innumerous.  It  can  affect  school  performance 
indirectly through improvement of infrastructure, such as water treatment, sanitation, heating, 
and  cooling.  Direct  effects  might  occur  via  children  being  able  to  read  and  write  better  and 
increased  concentration  and  motivation.  Artificial  lighting  extends  possible  teaching  and 
studying hours, which is important in rural areas where students usually work on family farms 
during the daytime.  

Further, electrification might increase schools' attractiveness and encourage attendance. 
For instance, one study found that electrification increased the likelihood of having a secondary 
school degree in Peru and Ghana (Welland, 2018). It might also increase teacher quantity and 
quality, given that rural schools have greater difficulty attracting and retaining (good) teachers. 
Energy  access  can  also  enable  the  use  of  computers  and  other  ICT  (information  and 
communication technologies) and the use of school’s buildings for adult literacy in the evenings 
(Welland, 2018).  

In fact, appropriate lighting seems  to  have positive returns on learning.  For instance, 
Dunn et al. (1985) found that children that feel more comfortable under light perform better 
with  a  brighter  ambient.  Sleegers  et  al.  (2012)  showed  that  an  adequate  lighting  system  has 
positive effects on the concentration of pupils. Further, electrification might increase schools' 
attractiveness and encourage attendance. Moreover, the electrification of schools may also have 
positive externalities for communities, such as  water  and sanitation and resilience to  natural 
disasters (Welland, 2018). Diniz et al. (2006) report a decrease in illiteracy and improvement 
in educational opportunities in poor municipalities in Minas Gerais state, which participated in 
a rural school electrification program. 

Despite great improvement in the last decade, school dropout remains a relevant issue, 
especially for rural schools. Dropout rates are much higher among poorer families (Leon and 
Menezes-Filho, 2002; Ney, Souza and Ponciano, 2010), working students (Leon and Menezes-
Filho, 2002;  Verner  and Cardoso, 2007) and  low-performance students  (Leon and Menezes-
Filho, 2002) in Brazil. These three elements match the profile of rural communities attended by 
the Light for All program (Programa Luz para Todos, in Portuguese). The program  aims to 
“provide  free  access  to  electricity  to  rural  families”  (our  translation),  in  particular  to  rural 
schools, quilombos, ribeirinhos and small farmers. The Light for All program in itself seems to 
have benefits on education outcomes. Using a regression discontinuity design, Cajiao (2018) 
show an positive and significant impact of energy access through the program on approval rates 
and  Portuguese  and  Mathematics  test  scores  for  children  in  the  5th  and  9th  year  of  primary 
education. 

The branch of LFA focused on schools is the Light for All in School (Luz para Todos 
na Escola, in Portuguese), that provides electricity to schools without access to electricity. As 
mentioned above, electricity has many potential returns  to education, including learning and 
school dropout, which LFAS expects to improve.  

This  study  aims  to  measure  the  effect  of  access  to  electricity  in  rural  schools  on  the 
dropout  rate  of  students  in  the  first  five  years  of  primary  education.  Our  goal  is  to  create  a 
dialogue between the studies on the benefits of electricity in vulnerable areas and the studies 
on education outcomes, contributing to this growing research area. We hope that our research 
helps  to  clarify  the  social  returns  of  electricity  provision  to  vulnerable  rural  regions  and  the 
impact on the education outcomes. 

We employ a differences-in-differences approach (DD) on a two-year panel of schools 
(2013 and 2016). Our results show that the Light for All in Schools program has a significant 

effect on the dropout rate of rural schools. Specifically, schools that received electricity by the 
program before 2013 had an improvement of 16% in the dropout rate in 3 years, and schools 
that were treated by the program between 2013 and 2016 had an improvement of 27% in 3 years 
due to the access to electricity. 

This result contributes as evidence that a proper infrastructure to teach and learn in initial 
years of schooling has an important role to retain children in schools and to, potentially, reduce 
child labor. Moreover, the gains that programs like the Light for All in Schools have to rural 
areas help to reduce inequality, first, reducing the educational gap between areas with different 
urbanization levels and, second, providing a higher capacitated human capital to less-developed 
regions. 

 

2.  School dropout and socioeconomic context in rural areas 

 
Both  literature  and  policy-making  use  scores  from  standardized  tests  to  evaluate  the 
effectiveness of schools. However, maximizing student learning, defined by specific metrics 
captured by these tests, may not be the only goal pursued by a school or an education system. 
These goals are defined by societies and can be multiple and interchangeable. Rumberger and 
Palardy (2005) argue that using only standardized tests provides an incomplete view of school 
performance  and may result in  erroneous conclusions about  which schools  are  effective and 
which characteristics promote effectiveness.  

Given that most of the national literature uses standardized test results (Felicio, 2008), 
using alternative indices is relevant because it encompasses other school aims (Rumberger and 
Palardy,  2005).  For  example,  ensuring  that  students  complete  their  education  can  be  as 
important as improving their academic performance (Rumberger and Palardy, 2005). School 
attendance and dropout present different trends throughout basic education and in urban and 
rural settings. Data from the 2010 Demographic Census show an overrepresentation: although 
only 18.6% of the population aged 4 to 17 years old live in rural areas, 27% of those out of 
school  live  in  rural  areas  (Alves  and  Silva,  2013).  As  Table  1  shows,  despite  its  decrease 
between 2007 and 2017, schools’ dropout rate is still higher in rural areas in 2017. Moreover, 
the decrease between the two years was steeper in urban schools.

Basic  education  in  Brazil  is  divided  into  three  stages:  i)  child  education  (children 
between 0 and 5 years old); ii) primary education covers 9 years (children between 6 and 14 
years old); and, iii) secondary has a minimum duration of three years (young people between 
15  and  17  years  old).  While  primary  education  has  been  compulsory  since  1971,  secondary 
education  only  became  mandatory  in  2009  by  Constitutional  Amendment  n.  59  (Alves  and 
Silva, 2013).

Aware of the differences in socioeconomic matters between urban and rural areas, most 
researches tend to study urban and rural schools separately. In fact, since only 11% of basic 
education students are enrolled in rural schools, rural education has received less focus in the 
Brazilian literature.4 Given this and the data discussed above, it is reasonable to assume that 
school  attendance  and  dropout  are  different  phenomena  for  different  education  stages  and 
geographic  areas.  Moving  forward,  we  focus  on  our  object  of  study,  which  is  rural  schools 
providing  the  first  years  of primary  education  (first  to  fifth  year,  children  between 6  and 10 
years old).  

In  general,  schools  and  classes  are  smaller  in  rural  education,  and  there  is  a  need  to 
provide transport to students and teachers. Thus, the cost per student in rural education is higher 
than in urban schools (Alves and Silva, 2013). Rural areas have higher poverty levels, adults 
have fewer years of schooling, and public services are provided at a lower quality. Problems of 
intergenerational  poverty  are  persistent  and  worsened  by  the  inequality  of  educational 
opportunities (Ney, Souza and Ponciano, 2010).  

With  data  from  the  National  Household  Sample  Survey  (in  Portuguese,  Pesquisa 
Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios - PNAD) from 2007, Ney, Souza  and Ponciano (2010) 
analyzed  primary  education  conclusion  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  In  both  geographic  areas, 
school  dropout  occurs  mainly  from  the  fourth  year  onward,  and  it  is  highest  for  the  poorest 
(below 40% in the income distribution).5 Even so, dropout is highest in rural than in urban areas 
in all of primary education. Parents with low education level are probably unaware of the import 
role  education  plays  in  social  ascension.  Considering  how  high  inequality  in  educational 
opportunities is in rural areas, intergenerational poverty tends to be more intensely reproduced 
(Ney, Souza and Ponciano, 2010; Kassouf, 2015). 

Moreover, there is the enduring problem of child labor. In 2015, 97 thousand children 
between the ages of 6 and 10 were working. Of those, 72 thousand lived in rural areas. That 
amounts  to  2.6%  of  children  living  in  rural  area  in  this  age  group  (PNAD,  2017).  Kassouf 
(2015)  argues  that  rural  areas  are  more  susceptible  to  child  labor  due  to  its  higher  levels  of 
poverty  and worse school  infrastructure and  a lower rate of technological innovation,  which 
might  discourage  school  attendance.  Likewise,  the  higher  prevalence  of  informal  jobs  and 
family agricultural works are also responsible for facilitating child labor. 

The consequences of child labor are many and multidimensional. It impairs on a person's 
ability  to  acquire  education  and  invest  in  human  capital  reducing  school  attendance  and 
performance. In its turn, low schooling and poor education achievement will limit employment 
opportunities to  positions with  no qualification requirements and low remuneration, keeping 
the person in the cycle of poverty already experienced by their parents (Kassouf, 2015). 

Discussing  the  solutions  to  child  labor,  Kassouf  (2015)  highlights  the  importance  of 
improving access to quality education, especially in poorest and hard-to-reach regions and for 
children in vulnerable situations. It is also essential to ensure the completion of (at least) basic 
education. 

 

3.  The Light for All in Schools program in Brazil 

The program Light for All (LFA) was created in 2003 through an executive order6 (EO) 
and is officially called “National Program for the Universalization of Electric Energy Access 
and Usage – Light for All”. The program was originally supposed to operate from 2003 to 2010 
but  was  expanded  by  four  consecutive  EOs  (2008,  2010,  2011,  2014  and  2018)  until  2022.

5 Primary education is divided between first years (1 - 5) and final years (6 - 9). Other studies (Leon and Menezes-Filho, 2002) 
also verify a higher dropout rate at the end of an education cycle. 
6 Executive Order number 4,873 / 2003. 

According to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, 16.4 million people received electricity in their 
home from 2004 to 2017. On its premise and goal, the EO (2011) states that “[the program] 
intends to allow the access to electric energy to the share of rural population which does not 
have access to this public service” (our translation).  

In its fifth article, the EO (2003) establishes as a priority “projects of rural electrification 
of public schools (…)”, from which derived the program supplement named Light for All in 
Schools (LFAS). Although schools are one priority of the program,  they  are below  (a)  rural 
houses below the poverty line, (b) houses within cities without basic living infrastructures and 
(c)  rural  familiar  settlements,  indigenous  communities,  quilombos,  and  other  small 
communities. 

In Figure 1 we draw the scheme of operation of the program. The program is organized in 
four  hierarchical  levels:  (1)  coordination,  (2)  operation,  (3)  schools  assessment  and  (4) 
execution. The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) of Brazil coordinates the program and is 
responsible for defining goals and deadlines. The operation is the responsibility of Eletrobras 
and  its  subsidiaries7.  The  Ministry  of  Education  is  responsible  for  evaluating  the  schools 
without  access  to  electric  energy  during  the  yearly  school  census.  Then,  Eletrobras  informs 
local management committees which schools do not have access to energy. Local Commissions 
demands  local  executors  (power  concessionaires)  to  provide  electricity  access.  Power 
concessionaires  elaborate  a  work  schedule  for  energy  provision,  which  is  approved  by 
Eletrobras,  and  execute  the  connection  of  the  schools.  Both  the  National  Management 
Committee for Universalization and the Brazilian electricity regulatory agency (ANEEL) assess 
the program performance.  

The LFA projects can have three sources of funding: (i) subventions, (ii) public financing 
and  (iii)  local  concessionaires’  own  resources.  The  subvention  is  a  direct  transfer  from  two 
sources,  the  “Energy  Development  Account”8  (CDE)  and  the  “Global  Reversion  Reserve”9 
(RGR), to local executors in order to mitigate regional deficiencies of funds or tariffs impacts. 
The public financing is  a contract  available to  local  executors by  Caixa  Econômica Federal 
(CAIXA, a government-owned bank) with technical supervision of Eletrobras. The total cost 
of the program financed by the CDE, RGR, and CAIXA was BRL 9.87 billion (deflated by the 
Consumer’s Price Index up to 2017), as reported by the MME in 2017 (BRL 608.71 per person 
or 2911.62 per family connected). 
 

 

                                                 
7 Eletrobras is a mixed public-private company, with operations on electricity distribution, transmission and generation. 
8 In 2002, the Energy Development Account (CDE, in Portuguese: Conta de Desenvolvimento Energético) is created aiming 
the energy development of states and competitiveness of power generation of wind, small hydro, biomass, natural gas and coal. 
In  particular,  the  CDE  creation  aimed  the  universalization  of  electricity.  Latter,  an  Executive  Order  (EO  4521)  provided  a 
guideline to the source of funds and using of the CDE. 

9 The Global Reversion Reserve (RGR, in Portuguese, “Reserva Global de Reversão”) was created in 1957 by the EO 41,019 
and aims the expansion and quality improvement of the public provision of electric energy. The reserve comes from sector 
charges payed by power concessionaires with an aliquot of 2.5% of the fixet asset of the company, with a cap of 3% of the 
revenues.

From a technical  perspective, Power Concessionaires may provide  electricity on-grid 
(connecting  the  school)  or  off-grid  (by  providing  microgeneration  facilities).  The  program 
operation manual gives five options of decentralized power generation: (i) micro hydro (< 100 
kW) or mini hydro (from 100 kW to 1 MW), (ii) small hydro (from 1 MW to 30 MW), (iii) 
small thermal power station (diesel or biomass), (iv) solar or wind micro-generation, (v) hybrid 
system combining previous options. 
 
Thus, the program governance, operation, and financing follow a very complex scheme, 
with  many  decision  levels  and  many  ways  to  calculate  the  costs  and  benefits  of  the 
electrification.  The  benefits  of  the  Light  for  All  projects,  like  the  LFAS,  are  still  being 
evaluated. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by highlighting the benefits the LFAS 
bring to rural education.  
 
4.  Methodology 

 
4.1. Data description 
The database used was a panel of schools constructed with two datasets: School Census of 
Basic  Education,  from  the  Ministry  of  Education  of  Brazil  (MEC),  and  the  Light  for  All  in 
Schools (LFAS) list of participants, from the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). The first 
database is publicly available but the second is only available through request. The Brazilian 
School Census is an annual survey published by the National Institute of Educational Studies 

and  Researches  Anísio  Teixeira  (INEP,  Instituto  Nacional  de  Estudos  e  Pesquisas 
Educacionais Anísio Teixeira in Portuguese), tied to the Ministry of Education. It is a national 
survey that covers private and public schools, from primary to secondary education, including 
vocational  schools.  The  School  Census  gathers  data  on  educational  establishments,  classes, 
students and school professionals.  

The Light for All in Schools list of participants is a database covering all schools identified 
as having improper access to electricity or no access at all by the Ministry of Education. The 
Ministry  of  Education  geolocalized  theses  schools  and  informed  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and 
Energy which schools to include in the “Light for All” program. The data is available by request 
and the access to it is guaranteed by the federal Information Access Law (n. 12.527/2011). The 
last version of LFAS database was updated between February/2014 and June/2015. Considering 
this, we used two censuses, 2013 and 2016, which gives us a two-period panel.  

MEC/MME database identifies 8,534 schools included in the LFAS program. We excluded 
schools  that  cannot  be  localized  by  the  MEC  (1%).  Moreover,  we  excluded  1,525  schools 
because  they  were  no  longer  active  in  2016  (18%).  Our  final  database  contains  13,826 
observations and 6,913 schools. Of those, 97.8%  have  primary  school  programs,  while only 
1.23% have secondary school programs, which is why we focus on primary school. 

Compared to the other schools in the Census, these schools represent, in average, 55% of 
schools reported as “without access” (Figure 2). We should also notice that the electrification 
rate has been rising since 2013. 12.9% per year in LFAS beneficiaries and 3.66% per year in 
schools outside of the program.

While 60% of our schools were disconnected from the grid in 2013, the share reduces to 
41% in 2016. As Figure 3 shows, we classified schools by four electrification status: (i) received 
electricity  before  2013,  (ii)  received  electricity  between  2013  and  2016,  (iii)  lost  electricity 
since 2013, and (iv) disconnected from the grid until 2016. We consider to be treated by the 
program the schools who retain the connection to the grid up until 2016, which are the ones in 
blue and orange areas in Figure 3.

4.2. Preliminary testing 
We use a log-likelihood estimation  of a multinomial  logit regression model to  check the 
electrification  pattern.  The  multinomial  logit  is  a  useful  tool  to  estimate  the  response  of 
unordered categorical variables (Menard, 2010). The purpose of using this model is to check if 
the  probabilities  of  the  electrification  status  can  be  explained  by  the  region  and  the 
characteristics of the community. The dependent variable to be estimated is the probability P 
of having the categorical variable 𝑌𝑖 in state m. Or 𝑃(𝑌𝑖 = 𝑚). Thus, we estimate: 

 

𝑃(𝑌𝑖 = 𝑚) =

exp⁡(𝑍𝑚𝑖)

1 + ∑

𝑀
ℎ=2

 
exp⁡(𝑍ℎ𝑖)

 

 

Where 𝑍ℎ𝑖 is the log-odds of each response model, following the distribution of 
 

𝑍ℎ𝑖 = log

𝑃(𝑌𝑖 = 𝑚)

𝑃(𝑌𝑖 = 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒)

= 𝛼ℎ + 𝑥𝑖

′𝛽ℎ 

In  our  model,  the  vector  of  variables  x  includes:  (i)  one  dummy  identifying  indigenous 
communities, (ii) one dummy identifying quilombola communities, (iii) four regional dummies, 
identifying  the  Northeast,  the  North,  the  South,  and  the  Southeast.  The  model  omitted  the 
disconnected from the grid until 2016 category as the baseline, and the Central West control 
region. 

We describe the results of this first test below (Table 2). For electrified schools (columns 3 
and 4), all control variables – except for the North and Indigenous Communities in column 3 – 
are significant at a confidence level of 95%. This indicates that the electrification status of “has 
access to electricity” can be explained by a set of variables with a fitness of 0.078.  

Looking at the signals, we have indigenous communities and North with negative effects 
on column 4 (received electricity before 2013). These variables show a positive signal between 
2013 and 2016, indicating these two characteristics were treated by LFAS in a latter period. 

This  can  explined  by  the  fact  that  access  to  remote  areas  in  the  North  region,  especially  to 
indigenous communities, is difficult. In fact, out of 515 indigenous schools, 321 (or 62%) were 
in the North region. In column 1, the number of rooms (positive coefficient) and the dummy 
for  indigenous  settlements  (positive  coefficient)  are  the  only  significant  coefficients.  This 
category,  schools  that  lost  electricity  since  2013,  represents  only  3%  of  all  schools,  and  we 
consider it to an exception.

4.3. Model 

From this first result, we elaborate our research question: does electricity access have 
positive effects on the dropout rate of schools? We use a differences-in-differences approach 
(DD) to compare treated and untreated schools between 2013 and 2016.  This method allows 
us to isolate the effects of policy on the dropout rate evolution. The Differences-in-Differences 
is a useful technique to compare the effect over time of two groups, one that was treated by the 
policy and the control group. Angrist and Pischke (2008) define it as 

 

𝑌𝑠𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛾Tr𝑠 ⁡ + λdt + 𝛽(Tr𝑠. dt) + 𝜖𝑠𝑡 

 
Where Tr is the treatment dummy, access to electricity, and 𝑑𝑡 is the time dummy indicating if 
the observation is in 2016 (= 1) or in 2013 (= 0). The interaction term indicates whether the 
treatment was before or after the intervention. In our case, 𝑌𝑠𝑡 is the dropout rate in the first five 
years of primary education, by school (s) in period t. Control dummies are added to support the 
estimation with the region and type of community of each school.  
 
 
5.  Descriptive analysis 

The descriptive statistics are shown on Table 3. While the mean dropout among all rural 
schools was 2% in 2016, that figure goes up to 3.9% in our sample10. Of our sample, 8% of 
schools are located in an indigenous community and 4% in a  quilombola community. While 
41% of our schools had energy access in 2013, that figure goes up to 58% in 2016.

Figure  4  shows  the  dropout  rate  by  the  status  of  electrification.  Overall,  dropout  rate 
dropped in all categories. Schools that never had energy had a higher rate compared to those 
which received electricity before 2016. Schools that lost access to electricity between 2013 and 
2016 have the highest dropout rate, although this experience is rare and might be overestimated 
due to the number of observations.  

Schools that gained access to electricity between 2013 and 2016 have the lowest average 
dropout rate in 2016. The decline in the dropout rate between 2013 and 2016 is steeper among 
schools who received electricity between 2013 and 2016 (0.51 p.p.) than among schools which 
received  electricity  before  2013  (0.38  p.p.).  This  could  indicate  that  the  benefits  of 
electrification  have  an  almost  immediate  impact  on  schools,  which  is  diluted  over  time.  At 
average, and without including any controls, schools that received access to electricity performs 
0.54 p.p. or 12.28% better on reducing the dropout rate.

Even when compared to other rural schools in Brazil, the LFAS present a unique profile 
(Table 4). We can see these are very small schools, with a 1.97 average number of employees 
5.42 number of rooms. The schools in our sample have little access to ICT. Even if 58% of our 
schools  have  energy  access,  only  0.15%  of  them  have  computers.  Regarding  infrastructure, 
almost the totally of our schools have a precarious sewage system, only 0.66% of them have 
drinkable water and 0.84% of them dispose of their garbage through burning. Very few of them 
have either a library or teachers' accommodation.

6.  Results 

Table 5 shows the results of the differences-in-differences model. The three coefficients, 
time, treatment  and  interaction are significant  (at  95% of confidence  level  for  treatment and 
Interaction  and  at  90%  of  confidence  level  for  time).  The  time  coefficient  is  negative,  as 
expected by the descriptive analysis, which means the dropout rate reduces over time. 

The dropout rate also reduces with energy access, as shown by the negative coefficient 
in variable the treatment. The interaction has a positive coefficient. This might mean the effect 
occurs in the short term, acting as a decelerating component of the effect. This would mean the 
treatment has a higher effect on children who have undergone the change in energy access than 
on those who later enroll in the school. 

The fitness of the model is indeed still very low with R-square around 0.39, but F-test 
indicates  that  the  model  is  overall  significant.  This  means  that  omitted  variables  may  be 
influencing the dropout rate in school, as expected. These variables include, but are not limited 

to,  performance,  infrastructure,  child  labor,  lack  of  public  transportation  to  access  school, 
parental background, etc.11

Using control variable averages, we can decompose the effect of program treatment the 
electrification  status  we  proposed  above  (Figure  6).  In  average,  schools  with  access  to 
electricity  in  2016  performed  much  better  in  reducing  dropout  rates.  Schools  that  received 
electricity between 2013 and 2016 had an average estimated decreasing of around 1 percentage 
point (or 27% of improvement) in the dropout rate, and schools that received electricity before 
2013 had a reduction of -0.6 percentage point (or 16% of improvement) due to electrification. 
Conversely, the effect on untreated schools was between 0.19 p.p. and -0.14 p.p. (+3% and -
3%, respectively). This effect, as expected, is very near to zero. 

 

 

                                                 
11 A second estimation was done including the number of rooms in school as a proxy of the size of school. The coefficient for 
this variable is significant but very small (0.0004 p.p. / room) and the average effect is 0.0008 p.p., the result is neglectable, 
meaning that the size of school is not important in determining the dropout rate in LFAS beneficiaries.  All other results are 
maintained.

7.  Conclusions 

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the program Light for All in Schools 
on the dropout rate in initial years of primary education. Although the benefits of electrification 
on learning can be huge, the  effect  of them on educational  outcomes  needs  deeper research, 
especially in isolated and less developed regions. 

We estimated the impact of the program on the dropout rate of schools using a two-year 
panel of schools and differences-in-differences approach. Our results show that the effects of 
electrification programs on the dropout rate are significant. Schools that received electricity by 
the program before 2013 had an improvement of 16% in the dropout rate in 3 years and schools 
that  were  treated  by  the  program  between  2013  and  2016  had  an  improvement  of  27%  in  3 
years. Comparably, schools that did not receive it had a near-to-zero effect on the dropout rate 
due to the lack of electricity. 

In general, we conclude that the Light for All in Schools was a successful program in 
reducing the dropout  rate  in  vulnerable rural  schools.  In absolute terms,  the benefit affected 
only 2% of the schools in Brazil (6% of rural schools) – where electricity access reaches 99.3% 
- but it is a huge contribution to the last mile problem. This result encourages similar programs 
to be adopted in other regions with similar problems of aisled communities. 

These vulnerable rural communities are plagued by problems such as higher levels of 
poverty, worse school infrastructure and child labor. Providing electrification to their schools 
is an import way of improving access to quality education and ensuring the conclusion of (at 
least) basic education. Increasing human capital might be a start in helping these children to 
break away from the cycle of intergenerational poverty.
