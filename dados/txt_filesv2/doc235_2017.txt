The purpose of this paper is to discuss the impact of income inequality on crime at a municipal

governments as an instrument for law enforcement, under the assumption that political interest 

could lead to the exogenous allocation of policing. This, combined with the use of a lagged 

dependent variable helps us soften the simultaneity bias associated with the joint determination 

of crime and law enforcement; which ultimately enables us to quantify the impact of inequality 

on crime.

Abstract: 

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the impact of income inequality on crime at a municipal 

level in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Motivated by Becker’s model as well as the abundant 

empirical work done on the determinants of crime, we propose a model which relates inequality 

and criminal behavior. Initially, we suggest that policing could impact inequality which should 

motivate  its  inclusion  in  our  model  explaining  crime.  This  leads  to  a  problem  of  jointly 

determined variables, the solution of which has been the main focus of criminal literature, and 

to  which  we  propose  the  use  of  an  instrumental  variable,  namely,  the  political  alignment 

between local and state government (proxied by the city’s mayor being from the same party as 

the governor’s). Using a two stage least square approach and testing the robustness of our 

results for several subsamples in which one or more assumptions would most likely hold  we 

found a consistently small, yet significant impact of inequality on crime.  

 

1.  Introduction 

The theoretical background of most of the work done on crime, from an economic perspective, 

stems directly or indirectly from Becker’s (1968) seminal paper. In it, the author postulates an 

economic model in which the supply of crime depends on penalties, potential gains and the 

opportunity cost associated with criminal behavior. In equilibrium, he suggests that an increase 

in law enforcement would lead to more probable penalties and, in terms, to a decrease in the 

supply of crime, in other words, one should expect a negative correlation between policing and 

crime.  Later,  Bourguignon  (1999)  further  explores  the  model  to  account  for  the  impact  of 

income-inequality on crime (which will be later discussed) in an attempt to draw a connection 

between the unequal distribution of resources and economic development, using crime as the 

cause for social unrest and subsequent depressed economic growth. The author suggests that 

 
there  should  exist  a  positive  correlation  between  income  inequality  and  crime,  particularly, 

crimes mainly motivated by financial gains such as robbery and theft. 

 

From an econometric perspective, the joint determination of crime and  law enforcement can 

create an endogeneity problem. In fact, most of the literature on the subject has attempted to 

solve this problem through various mechanisms. Corman and Mocan (2000) use monthly data 

under  the  assumption  that  hiring  and  training  police  officer  takes  time,  which  delays  the 

government’s response and thus crime in period 𝑡 + 1 is deterred by the police force decided 

based  on  the  level  of  crimes  in  𝑡,  which  softens  simultaneity  bias.  Levitt  (1997)  uses  an 

instrumental variable, arguing that in election periods policing increases arbitrarily, thus crime 

deterrence could be decomposed in an endogenous and an exogenous element, to which the 

author  applied  a  two-stage  least  squared  (2SLS)  approach.  McCrary  (2002)  later  found  a 

computational error in Levitt’s work, to which the latter conceded in his reply in 2002 (see Levitt 

(2002)).  In  probably  one  of  the  most  important  papers  to  handle  this  endogeneity  issue,  Di 

Tella and Schargrodsky (2004) observe an increase in law enforcement in Buenos Aires after 

a terrorist attack, namely, a natural experiment of sorts, assumed to be exogenous from the 

level of other forms of crime, allowing the authors to successfully isolate the effect of policing 

on crime.  

Lastly, we turn our attention to a paper more closely related to ours. Fajnzylber, Lederman and 

Loayza  (2002)  investigate  the  link  between  income  inequality  and  crime  across  several 

countries.  The  authors  resort  to  a  theoretical  model  suggested  in  Glaeser,  Sacerdote  and 

Scheinkmann (1996), later discussed, which attributes inertial properties to crime and combine 

it with theoretical work of Arellano and Bond (1991) and Arellano and Bover (1995) on the use 

of appropriately lagged dependent variable as a mean to counter endogeneity caused by the 

joint determination of crime and policing.  

In  this  paper,  we  will  focus  on  a  combination  of  techniques,  particularly,  we  will  use  both  a 

lagged dependent variable and an instrument. With data set from Brazil that has information 

on  several  city  characteristic  our  two  stage  least  square  approach  yielded  a  small,  but 

significant,  positive  relation  of  inequality  on  crime,  yet,  the  size  of  the  impact  might  not  be 

sufficient to justify public policy regarding inequality aiming to reduce crime on the short-run.  

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Theoretical Framework 

Bourguignon (1999) explores an interesting and simple model, inspired by Becker (1968), to 

show that income inequality impacts crime rates positively. We shall briefly discuss a simple 

version thereof. 

An  agent  chooses  to  commit  a  crime  if  the  expected  payoff  of  doing  so  is  larger  than  the 

alternative.  To analyze  this  choice,  we  consider  a  city  of  poor  and  rich agents.  Rich  agents 

initially have income 𝑤𝑟 and poor agents, 𝑤𝑝. Consider also a probability 𝑝 of getting caught if 

committing a crime, that crime pays a fraction of the victim’s income 𝑥𝑤𝑗 if the offender is not 

caught, and a linear function of the agent’s income, −𝑓𝑤𝑖 otherwise; and that the utility function 

of money is 𝑢(. ) = 𝑙𝑛(. ). 

In that scenario, an agent 𝑘 of type 𝑖 commits crime against victims of type 𝑗 if, and only if, 

(1 − 𝑝) 𝑙𝑛(𝑤𝑖 + 𝑥𝑤𝑗) + 𝑝(𝑙𝑛(𝑤𝑖(1 − 𝑓))) > 𝑙𝑛(𝑤𝑖) + ℎ𝑘 + 𝜉𝑘, 

where  ℎ𝑘  is  a  personal  degree  of  honesty,  and  𝜉𝑘  accounts  for  any  other  unobservable 

conditions that affect the individual’s choice to commit a crime. 

↔ (1 − 𝑝) 𝑙𝑛(𝑤𝑖 + 𝑥𝑤𝑗) > (1 − 𝑝) 𝑙𝑛(𝑤𝑖) + ℎ𝑘 + 𝜉𝑘   − 𝑝 𝑙𝑛(1 − 𝑓) 

↔ 𝜓(𝑝, 𝑤𝑗, 𝑤𝑖, 𝑥, 𝑓) ∶= (1 − 𝑝) 𝑙𝑛 (1 +

𝑥𝑤𝑗
𝑤𝑖

) +  𝑝 (𝑙𝑛(1 − 𝑓)) > ℎ𝑘 + 𝜉𝑘, 

This shows that for fixed levels of ℎ𝑘 and 𝜉𝑘, one chooses crime only when the ratio 

𝑤𝑗
𝑤𝑖

 is large 

enough. In our model  ℎ𝑘 is random variable with a distribution 𝐻 that captures the different 

levels of honesty of individuals within a same city, whereas 𝜉𝑘 , also assumed to be a random 

variable, captures other intrinsic city characteristics that could impact crime and are uniformly 

distributed among the citizens of a particular city and yet vary across municipalities. In other 

words,  ℎ𝑘 + 𝜉𝑘  simultaneously  captures  unobservable  city  and  individual  characteristics, 

relevant  to  crime  rates.  Thus,  a  city  with,  ceteris  paribus,  larger  inequality,  and  therefore, 

larger𝜓, should have more people 𝑘 such that the unobservable characteristic from both city 

and individual is smaller than 𝜓, increasing crime rates. The purpose of this paper is to  test 

whether such an effect exists. 

However,  other  than  different 

𝑤𝑗
𝑤𝑖

  ratio,  the  model  allows  for  variation  of  other  variables, 

impacting crime rates directly. As 𝑝 increases due to more or more efficient law enforcement, 

for example, we can see from the partial derivative: 

 

𝜕𝜓
𝜕𝑝

= − 𝑙𝑛 (1 +

𝑥𝑤𝑗
𝑤𝑖

) + 𝑙𝑛(1 − 𝑓) = 𝑙𝑛 (

1 − 𝑓
𝑥𝑤𝑗
𝑤𝑖

1 +

 

) < 0 

that 𝜓 is decreasing, which reduces the probability of one choosing crime, corroborating Becker 

(1968),  Corman  and  Mocan  (2000)  and  Di  Tella  and  Schargrodsky  (2004),  all  of  which 

assumed that law enforcement curtails crime rates. 

Note that 𝑓 and 𝑥 could also vary, but restricted to differences in penalties and types of crime. 

However, in Brazil, the federal government is the sole legislator over criminal laws, and our 

work concerns only burglary, not allowing for such kinds of variation. 

Other  than  the  parameters  in  𝜓,  we  allow  for  variation  of  the  distribution  of  ℎ𝑘 + 𝜉𝑘   among 

cities. As the inhabitants of a city are distributed differently in regards to their levels of honesty, 

ceteris paribus, the mass of probability of 𝐻 corresponding to small values becomes different, 

making it either more or less probable for 𝜓 to be larger than ℎ𝑘 + 𝜉𝑘, increasing or reducing 

crime rates. The idea to allow for varying degrees of honesty was introduced by Glaeser et al. 

(1996). In the paper, the authors see potential offenders in mainly three groups, independent 

from wealth; one group that rationally decides whether or not to commit a crime based on all 

the parameters;  one  consisting  of extreme  law-abiders  (with  acutely  high  levels  of honesty) 

and, another, of extreme lawbreakers (with acutely low levels of honesty), both to  which the 

choice  of  committing  a  crime  is  more  biased  by  individual  tendencies  rather  than  by 

environmental  conditions.  Thus,  capturing  the  effect  of  ℎ𝑘 + 𝜉𝑘  on  crime  rates  are  nearly 

impossible, since we cannot control for the many of the unobservable variables which shape 

its distribution. Further, we assume that most of these characteristics are relatively persistent 

over  time,  which  causes  the  inertial  behavior  of  crime,  previously  mentioned.  Thus,  this 

motivates us to include a lagged crime rate as an independent variable in our model that tries 

to capture the effect of ℎ𝑘 + 𝜉𝑘, since these unobservable variables impact crime rate in 𝑡 as 

well as in 𝑡 − 1 rather homogenously.  

Lastly, not considered in the model for sake of its simplicity, it is also important to account for 

factors such as the facility of getting jobs, reflected by both the urbanization and employment 

rate,  as  supported  by  Fajnzylber  et  al.  (2002).  Education  and  the  overall  wealth  are  also 

important factors, the first for its likely impact on ℎ𝑘 and the latter due to the concavity of 𝑢(. ) =

𝑙𝑛(. )  which  implies  that  for  larger  levels  of  wealth,  the  marginal  gain  of  criminal  activity  is 

smaller, hindering such behavior.  

 

 
 

 

3.  Data  

3.1 Variables and Sources 

Our model obviously is concerned with the interactions between more abstract variables such 

as wealth, inequality and crime. In this section we explore variables which we believe to be 

good enough proxies, more precisely, good measurements of these variables.  

We begin with inequality, our main variable. Here, the GINI index is consistently used across 

literature as the best measurement of inequality, we obtained it a municipal level from IBGE 

(“Instituto  Brasileiro  de  Geografia  e  Estatística”).  It  is  an  index  ranging  from  0  to  1  that 

measures  how  unequally  distributed  incomes  are.  Values  closer  to  0  indicate  more  equally 

distributed, and values closer to 1, more unequally distributed income among inhabitants. Our 

proxy for political alignment, later used as an instrumental variable, is a dummy variable that 

indicates  whether  the mayor  of  each  city  was  of  the  political  party  PSDB  in 2010,  assumes 

value  1  if  so,  and  0  otherwise.  This  variable  was  constructed  from  the  database  from  TSE 

(“Tribunal Superior Eleitoral”) and its reasoning will be better explained in section 4.2. 

For our measurement of crime, we chose the number of robberies per 100,000 inhabitants, 

since these types of offenses are the ones more likely to be motivated by income inequality as 

suggested by our theoretical framework.  For both years (2009 and 2010) we use data from 

SEADE (“Fundação Sistema Estadual de Análise de Dados”) through IMP (“Informação dos 

Municípios  Paulistas”).  Our  measurement  for  policing  was  perhaps  the  most  difficult  one  to 

define, since it ought to capture both the level of law enforcement as well as its quality. Had 

we chosen the number of police officers, for instance, we could miss out on quality, since we 

could have a corrupt or compliant body of law enforcement that did not actively combat crime. 

We decided to go for the number of police inquires which implies that an active investigation 

was opened and therefore captures the size of policing and its active deterrence of crime. This 

data was extracted from from SSP (“Secretaria de Segurança Pública”).  

For our control variables, we use the natural logarithm of the GDP per capita, the percentage 

of urbanization of the city, as a proxy for the levels of education we use high school dropout 

rate,  namely,  the  percentage  of  high  school  dropouts  in  relation  to  students  who  had  not 

dropped out by the end of the school year and, lastly, as a proxy for the ease of obtaining a job 

we used the formal employment rate measured by dividing the number of formal jobs by the 

population of the city. Note, however, that this ratio might be bigger than 1, as the number of 

 
jobs might be larger than the population. However, this does not damage the intuition of such 

measurement. All of these variables were taken from SEADE (“Fundação Sistema Estadual 

de Análise de Dados”) through IMP (“Informação dos Municípios Paulistas”). 

 

Our measurement of wealth, employment and urbanization are pretty straightforward and used 

in most of the literature on the subject, the effect that wealth is logged surely interconnects with 

our  assumption  regarding  our  representative  individual’s  utility  function.  With  respect  to 

education, we chose high school dropout rate since it is a major determinant of employment in 

posterior  stages  of  life  as  well  a  deterrent  of  criminal  behavior  in  adolescence,  when  most 

underprivileged children begin their ilicit activities.  

3.2 Descriptive Analysis 

Here, we summarize and present the correlation matrix and summary table of the variables 

included in regressions throughout the paper. Note, most importantly for the analysis later, that 

the covariance between the GINI index and police inquiries rates is different from zero   and 

that police inquires and robbery rates are negatively correlated as well as GINI and crime are 

positively correlated. It is also relevant to turn our attention to the standard deviations of crime 

rates and GINI index later for our conclusion.

4.  Econometric Model 

4.1 Primitive Model and its Limitations 

Having  analyzed  the microeconomic  motivation  behind  the  interaction  between  crime  rates, 

inequality,  law  enforcement,  education,  the  one-year  lagged  crime  rates,  urbanization  and 

employment  rates,  we  propose  the  following  approximate  linear  model,  proxied  by  the 

 

appropriate variables defined in section 3: 

𝑡
𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑦_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑖

= 𝜃0 +   𝐺𝐼𝑁𝐼𝑖𝜃1 +   𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑒_𝑖𝑛𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑖

𝑡−1𝜃3
+ 𝐺𝐷𝑃_𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑖𝜃4 + 𝑢𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑖𝜃5 + 𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑡_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑖𝜃6

𝑡𝜃2 + 𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑦_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑖

(1) 

+ 𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑖𝜃7 + 𝛾𝑖 

 

OLS will not be consistent in estimating the above equation since including law enforcement 

could lead to a problem of simultaneous equations, in which 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋𝑖, 𝛾𝑖) ≠ 0, if and only if there 

was the joint determination of crime and policing in period t and in such case, in such case it 

would ill advised to simply use OLS. 

However,  one  might  argue  that  because  security  budgets  are made  on  a  yearly  basis,  how 

much  governments  both  on  state  and  municipal  level  spend  with  security  is  impacted  by 

criminal rates from the past. In such case, the inclusion of a lagged dependent variable would 

more than suffice to counter any form of endogeneity. This relationship, however, is not entirely 

rigid on a municipal level, since most policing is done by the Military Police, which is controlled 

by  the  state  government  but  allocated  across  cities  with  certain  flexibility;  thus,  simply 

controlling by the one-year lag does not entirely solve our endogeneity problem, since cities 

that  display  higher  crime  rates  in  year  𝑡  could  see  a  larger  allocation  of  resources  in  law 

enforcement throughout the year. And, equivalently, this could deter criminal behavior. Thus, 

our endogeneity problem persists if we include policing, even if controlled by the lagged crime 

rate.  

It is important to mention that if we were to simply remove policing as an independent variable, 

we would most likely produce a consistent OLS estimator for our parameter of interest, namely 

𝜃1, since there would be no joint determination of dependent and independent variables and 

thus 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋𝑖, 𝛾𝑖) = 0 would hold. This would be true if and only if there was also no interaction 

between policing and inequality, otherwise we would have omitted variable bias and 𝜃1 would 

also be  inconsistent,  since policing  would be  captured by  the  error  term and  if  policing  was 

significant to inequality then again, we would have 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋𝑖, 𝛾𝑖) ≠ 0.  

 

 
There are several paths through which inequality could interact with policing and although our 

microeconomic model is limited in that regard, we could argue, for instance, that higher rates 

of  policing  in  an  unequal  city  would  be  allocated  to  poorer  boroughs,  which  are  heavily 

dependent on the informal economy and which would see a drop of economic activity in the 

light  of  more  ostensive  law  enforcement,  deepening  inequality.  Equivalently,  it  is  also 

reasonable  to  expect  that  more  unequal  cities  would  see  political  pressure  from  the  richest 

citizens for more ostensive law enforcement, in terms of our model, we could expect that an 

individual 𝑤𝑟 would be prone to financing a politician willing to increase law enforcement (and, 

thus, 𝑝 ) to discourage individual 𝑤𝑝 from committing a crime against 𝑤𝑟. Although it is not the 

purpose  of  this  paper  to  analyze  such  relationship  (and  there  is  bountiful  literature  on  the 

subject of Conflict Theory regarding policing and inequality), we believe there to be one, which 

we will empirically test.  

In such case, by including policing and acknowledging that it is somewhat codetermined with 

our dependent variable, we are forced to reject the hypothesis that 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋𝑖, 𝛾𝑖) = 0 and we will 

proceed under the assumption that our primitive model is endogenous and OLS is inconsistent. 

 

4.2  The use of an Instrumental Variable 

To  try  to  bypass  this  endogeneity  problem,  we  will  resort  to  an  instrumental  variable.  The 

political party PSDB has successfully retained control of the state government of São Paulo for 

more than two decades; having elected the last 4 out of 5 governors since 1995 and being 

uninterruptedly in power for the past decade. Thus, the alignment between municipal power 

with the state’s is somewhat important when it comes to the allocation of resources, such as 

law enforcement, especially, the Military Police. To overcome our endogeneity problem, we will 

use a dummy variable which assumes value 1 when the mayor of a city is also from PSDB and 

0 otherwise.  

Thus, we initially assume that a mayor being from PSDB is correlated with the level of policing 

in  that  city,  measured  by  the  number  of  police  inquiries.  However,  it  is  also  reasonable  to 

believe  that  the  state  government  allocates  resources  strategically,  thus,  a  city  politically 

fragmented or with a population insignificant for state elections could systematically receive 

less support even if the elected mayor is from the same party, which implies that the effect of 

PSDB on policing should be stronger in cities that do not present the previous conditions.   

Moreover, our main identification assumption is that having a PSDB mayor is uncorrelated with 

any omitted variable that could impact crime rates. This is, of course, a bold and untestable 

assumption which could be easily undermined if, for instance, a city’s ideology towards PSDB 

 

 
was  accompanied  by  bigger  investments  in  infrastructure  and  education  by  the  state 

government that could raise incomes and mitigate crime through various channels. Although 

we cannot test such an assumption, we will test the robustness of our results by later restricting 

our sample to cities which we believe will simultaneously reduce the effect of any unobservable 

variable correlated with our instrument as well as  where our instrument will be strongest (to 

compensate for the reduced numbers of observations), in an attempt to somehow curtail the 

effects of cities with extreme PSDB-leaning tendencies or extreme PSDB-aversion that could 

potentially violate our main identification assumption. However, it is noteworthy that the effect 

of any possibly unobservable variable is mitigated by the use of a lagged dependent variable, 

since the impact of being PSDB-leaning, for instance, is captured by crime rates in the previous 

year as well; thus, provided that there is no acute variation in PSDB support between 2009 and 

2010  (a  more  reasonable  assumption)  the  use  of  a  lag  should  suffice  to  ensure  our 

identification assumption. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5. Result Analysis 

5.1 Main Findings 

 

In  this  section,  we  will  analyze  our  empirical  results.  We  begin  by  trying  to  capture  the 

relationship between policing and inequality mentioned in section 4.1.  The four regressions 

below, columns 1 through 4, regress the GINI Index against policing and several subsets of 

our control variables. In all of them policing positively impacts inequality to a significance level 

of 5% and in three quarters of the regressions to a 1% level of significance. Even though we 

do not believe this model to be a good enough description of the causes of inequality (this was 

not,  after  all,  the  purpose  of  this  paper),  we  believe  that  it  provides  sufficient  evidence  that 

there is a strong enough relationship between inequality and policing such that by omitting the 

latter from equation (1) would lead to omitted variable bias. Since law enforcement seems to 

be  positively  correlated  with  inequality  and  theory  suggests  that  policing  negatively  impacts 

crime,  by  omitting  policing  we  would  most  likely  incur  in  a  negative  asymptotic  bias,  thus, 

underestimating the possibly positive impact of inequality on crime.

Having  included  policing),  we  are  now  faced  with  the  endogeneity  problem  previously 

mentioned. We proceed by estimating our two stage least square  in the full sample and our 

main model given in equation (1) while omitting policing.

We immediately turn our attention to column 5, in which one can observe that our instrument, 

namely PSDB, is significant in explaining law enforcement to a 5% level of significance, as we 

had anticipated in section 4.2. Not only that, but our exogenous variables and our instrument 

have jointly explained policing so that the p-value of our F-test is kept well below the 1% level 

of significance. However, one must have in mind that our first stage regression has a low R2 of 

merely  6%,  which  leads  to  a  gain  in  variance  in  our  second  stage,  hindering  some  of  our 

inference work. 

 

 
Turning our attention to column 6, one notices that the effect of law enforcement on crime is 

not entirely significant, but the estimator is distributed mostly over negative values, with a p-

value of 16.5%, at least weakly corroborating our initial assumption. The purpose of using an 

instrumental variable was not to fully estimate the effect of policing on crime, but rather to break 

some of the endogeneity of jointly determined variables so that we could produce a consistent 

estimator for the effect of inequality on crime. For this effect, we believe that our instrument 

has served quite well, nearly doubling the effect of inequality on crime when compared to our 

model  without  law  enforcement  given  in  column  7,  thus,  corroborating  our  conjecture  that 

omitting policing would lead to the underestimation of our coefficient of interest.  

It is also important to mention that some of our control variables, such as the rates of formal 

employment and high school dropouts as well as  the logged GDP per capita, are not much 

relevant  statistically  in  columns  5  through  7,  this  is  in  part  due  to  the  use  of  our  lagged 

dependent variable, which already captures some of those variables effects; but then again, 

the purpose of these controls was to help better isolate the magnitude of the effect of inequality 

on crime and this has been achieved.  

Additionally, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis to a 5% level of confidence that our 

model is exogenous via a Hausman Test, however, since theory suggests that the model is 

simultaneously determined, we understand that by not rejecting this, we might be committing 

a type II error, which leads us to prefer the use of an instrumental variable anyhow. 

5.2 Robustness Test 

Lastly,  the  only  assumption  we  are  not  yet  satisfied  with  is  the  identification  hypothesis 

regarding  our  instrument,  namely,  that  the  covariance  between PSDB  and our error  term  is 

equal  to  0.  Here,  the  best  we  can  do  is  to  attenuate  the  possible  effect  of  a  city  being 

ideologically PSDB-leaning or extremely PSDB-averse by removing cities which were won on 

a  land-slide.  This  obviously  considerably  reduces  our  sample,  which  would  make  our 

instrument  particularly  weak  in  the  first  stage,  hindering  any  possible  inference  work  in  our 

second stage. To mitigate that, we also remove cities that have been won with very few votes, 

which  implies  that  they  are  small  cities  without a  second  round  (under 200.000  inhabitants) 

and politically fragmented in the sense that are multiple candidates; making these cities less 

likely to receive support from the state government as suggested in section 4.2. Thus, we turn 

our attention to two subsamples: cities where the winning candidate had between 40% and 

60% of the valid votes (sum of every vote casted to every candidate) and between 38.16% and 

72.56%, namely the average (55.36%) plus and minus a standard deviation (17.20%).

Columns 8 and 9 are the first stages of our two stage least square approach in both of our 

subsamples. One can clearly see that our instrument remains significant in both cut-outs, yet 

in  the  smaller  and  more  restrictive  sample,  the  instrument’s  p-value  and  the  regressions  F-

statistic are both kept below the 1% threshold instead of the 5% in column 9. Also, the R2 of 

regression in column 8 is also bigger, 8.8% as opposed to 5.6% from regression in 9, which 

will facilitate some of the inference work in the second stage. Columns 10 and 11, below, are 

OLS estimations in our subsamples excluding policing (as done in the regression in column 7), 

while columns 12 and 13 are our second stage estimates for our samples.

Here there are some interesting points to be made. First, we turn our attention to column 12, 

where the GINI index continues significant to a 10% level of significance even in a considerably 

smaller sample and with a coefficient of 147.6 is very close to our estimate of 172 for the full 

sample. The weaker instrument in the regression in column 9 has caused a loss of significance 

in column 13, albeit very small, since the p-value was 10.5%. In terms of magnitude, however, 

our coefficient continues sufficiently close to our full-sample estimate. In columns 10 and 11 

we  have  repeated  our  exercise  of  removing  policing  and  running  our  regression  with  OLS. 

 
When this was done for the full sample, the effect of inequality went from 90.37 to 172, nearly 

doubling; restricting the sample we observed a staggering similar effect in terms of magnitude, 

from columns 10 to 12 the coefficient grew from 67.43 to 147.6 whereas from columns 11 to 

13 it grew from 66.87 to 144.9 (nearly doubling in both cases).  

 

Bottom line is that the exercise of restricting our sample to attenuate the endogenous  effect 

caused  in  the  event  of  our  identification  hypothesis  failing  produced  similar  results  to  that 

observed  in  the  full-sample,  admittedly  with  a  loss  of  significance.  This  makes  us  more 

confident  in  using  our  instrument  and  somehow  corroborates  our  argument  that  the  use  a 

lagged depended variable suffices to control for any unobservable variable that could cause 

our instrument to be endogenous.   

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

6. Conclusion 

 

Initially  we  set  out  to  isolate  the  effect  of  inequality  on  crime,  but  since  we  could  not 

disregard the interaction of policing and crime, we were forced to include law enforcement 

in our model, causing a problem of jointly determined variables in our linear regression. To 

solve  such  problem,  we  applied  an  instrumental  variable  to  cleanse  some  of  the 

endogenous effect caused by the simultaneity in law enforcement and crime in an attempt 

to isolate the effect of inequality on crime and to make OLS loosely more consistent. Here, 

our identification hypothesis could be undermined by a set of unobservable variables such 

as ideology, however,  we argue that the use of our lagged depended variable serves to 

capture some of those variables, in addition to also capturing the inertial properties of crime 

as suggested in Glaeser et al (1996) and helping to mitigate our endogeneity problem. To 

test the robustness of our results, we took subsamples in which we believe the effect of any 

unobservable variable correlated with PSDB would be less significant and our identification 

hypothesis  could  be  undermined,  and  we  observed  consistency  in  our  method.  Yet,  our 

instrument has not been sufficiently strong to compellingly show that policing is negatively 

correlated with crime, but we believe it was effective enough to better isolate the effect of 

inequality on crime, our initial goal.  

In  terms  of  our  results,  we  were  able  to  show  that  inequality  positively  impacts  robbery 

rates, as the literature on the subject anticipated. In terms of magnitude, a coefficient of 172 

for the GINI index implies that a 0.01 variation of the index (contained within 0 and 1) would 

cause an increase of 1.72 robberies per 100 000 inhabitants. Put differently, a city A more 

unequal  by  one  standard  deviation,  0.05,  from  a  city  B  should  expect  an  additional  8.6 

robberies  per  100  000  people or  approximately  1/30  standard  deviations  of  the  average 

robbery rate. Thus, although the effect of inequality exists and is statistically significant, it 

is  not  the  major  determinant  of  crime  independently;  meaning  that  the  effect  only  of 

inequality, fixing all other explanatory variables, is not large; which could imply that public 

policy  aiming  to  reduce  criminality  should  look  elsewhere  for  an  efficient  solution  on  the 

short-run.  However,  a  more  equal  society  could  observe  larger  levels  of  education  and 

stronger institutions in the long-run both of which could translate into better economic output 

and employment rates, subsequently mitigating crime through various channels.
