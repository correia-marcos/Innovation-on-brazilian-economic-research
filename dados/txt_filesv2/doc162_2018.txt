ABSTRACT: This paper reports the results of an application using an interregional input-output matrix 
for Morocco together with regional information on water consumption by sectors. We develop a trade-
based  index  that  reveals  the  relative  water  use  intensities  associated  with  specific  interregional  and 
international  trade  flows.  We  estimate,  for  each  flow  associated  with  each  origin-destination  pair, 
measures of trade in value added and trade in water that are further used to calculate our index. We add 
to the existing literature on virtual water flows by encompassing the subnational perspective in the case 
study of a country that shows a “climate divide”: while a great part of the southern territory is located 
in the Sahara Desert, with serious water constraints, the northern part is relatively more privileged with 
access to this natural resource. Furthermore, we compare that Trade-Based Index of Water Intensity to 
similar metrics related to the use of other natural resources.

1. Introduction 
 

Considered as one of the most poorly endowed countries in water resources, Morocco has 
intimately linked its economic and social development to the control of its natural resources. The 
country has developed strategies and policies aiming at the best management and valorization of 
such  resources.  It  has  built,  in  the  last  decades,  a  large  system  of  hydropower  infrastructure 
consisting of approximately 139 large dams, with a storage capacity of more than 17 billion m3, 
and  several  transfer  systems  that  allow  the  physical  transposition  of  water  to  the  driest  areas 
(Ministry of Water, 2016). 

These  strategies  have  played  a  key  role  in  food,  water,  and  energy  security  for  the 
population,  particularly  through  improved  access  to  drinking  water  and  hydroelectric  power,  as 
well as protection against floods and droughts. Nevertheless, good governance of water resources 
requires  continuing  attention  in  Morocco,  especially  in  the  face  of  a  significant  increase  in  the 
demand for water and its multiple uses in the context of a growing population and an expanding 
economy  (Global  Nexus,  2017).  Moreover,  adding  to  the  long-term  changes  to  recent  dry 
conditions in Morocco, global climate change is projected to increase the frequency, length and 
severity  of  drought  episodes  in  the  country,  directly  and  indirectly  compromising  the  living 
standards of the population (Esper et al., 2007; Masih et al., 2014; Imani et al., 2014; Roson and 
Sartori, 2015). 

In addition to physical relocation processes, interregional transfers of water resources also 
take place virtually through trade flows (Allan, 1993). Differences in water availability across the 
country enhance regional comparative advantage in resource-intensive sectors, such as agriculture, 
in  water-rich  areas  (Wichelns,  2004;  Duchin  and  López-Morales,  2012).  Such  differences  are 
revealed in the structure of interregional trade, in which virtual water flows are associated with the 
resources embedded in the production chain of the traded goods. 

Research on water accounting, mainly related to international trade flows, has boosted in 
the  last  few  years  with  the  development  of  worldwide  input-output  systems  and  the  stronger 
concern with resources availability in the context of global climate change (Hoekstra and Hung, 
2002;  Dietzenbacher  and  Velázquez,  2007;  Hoekstra  and  Chapagain,  2009;  Feng  et  al.,  2011; 
Daniels et al., 2011; Lenzen et al., 2013a; Tamea et al., 2016). Accountability of the pressure on 
the use of the world’s natural resources has reached the political debate, as attempts to characterize 
countries according to their historical, current and expected role played in this process has reopened 
political  fissures (Victor et  al.,  2014). Similarly to nations, regions  within countries can also  be 
characterized by their pressure on the demand for natural resources. As shown by Hoekstra and 
Chapagain (2009), local water depletion is often closely tied to the structure of the global economy. 
For regions within a country, the national economy adds another layer to the relevant structural 
hierarchy to understand resources uses (Zhang et al., 2016; Visentin, 2017). 

This paper reports on the results of an application with an interregional input-output matrix 
for  Morocco  which  allows  calculating  the  total  volume  of  water  that  is  directly  and  indirectly 
embodied in specific trade flows. Thus, the concept of virtual water in this paper is defined within 
the input-output framework, which determines the virtual water content in one monetary unit of a 
given product (Dietzenbacher and Velázquez, 2007). The input-output system was developed as 
part  of  a  technical  cooperation  initiative  involving  researchers  from  the  Regional  and  Urban 
Economics Lab at the University of São Paulo (NEREUS), in Brazil, and the OCP Policy Center 
and the Department of Economic Studies and Financial Forecast (DESFF), under the Ministry of 
Economy and Finance, both in Morocco (Haddad et al., 2017). A fully specified interregional input-
output database was estimated for 2013, considering 20 sectors in 12 Moroccan  regions (IIOM-
MOR). Using this database together with information on water consumption by sectors, we develop 
a trade-based index that reveals the relative water use intensities associated with interregional and 
international trade flows. We estimate, for each flow originated in one of the Moroccan regions, 
measures of trade in value added and trade in water that are further used to calculate our index. The 

2 

parsimonious approach proposed in Los et al. (2016), based on “hypothetical extraction”, serves as 
the methodological anchor. Results point to different ratios of water use to value added, not only 
when aggregate domestic trade flows are compared to Moroccan international exports, but also to 
differences within the country. 

We add to the existing literature on virtual water flows by encompassing the intra-country 
perspective in the case study of a country that shows a “climate divide”: while a great part of the 
southern territory is located in the Sahara Desert, with serious water constraints, the northern part 
is relatively more privileged with access to this natural resource. Few studies have analyzed virtual 
water flows in  Morocco  considering different  perspectives. Schyns and Hoekstra (2014) carried 
out  a  detailed  Water  Footprint  Assesment  for  Morocco.  Using  a  bottom-up  water  footprint 
accounting approach, the authors were able to map the water footprint of different activities at river 
basin and monthly scale, distinguishing between surface- and groundwater. Boudhar et al. (2017) 
developed their study relying on a top-down approach based on input-output analysis. The authors 
used a national input–output model of water use to analyze the relationships between economic 
sectors and water resources use in Morocco (i.e. direct water use) as well as the intersectoral water 
relationships (i.e. indirect water use). The results provided insights on a categorization of sectors 
that  exhibits  higher  direct  water  use  and  those  with  higher  indirect  water  use.  From  a 
methodological standpoint, the differences between bottom-up and top-down approaches are due 
to  inter-sectoral  effects  (Feng  et  al.,  2011).  While  bottom-up  approaches  do  not  fully  trace 
intersectoral linkages, top-down approaches, based on input-output techniques, are able to calculate 
the water footprint by tracing the whole supply chains. In this paper we have opted to follow a top-
down approach, adding to previous work the integrated water-economic analysis of supply chains 
in an explicit regional (sub-national) setting. 

In what follows, Section 2 presents different dimensions of regional disparities in Morocco, 
considering the geography of water and the spatial economic structure of the country. Section 3 
describes the methodology to be used in Section 4 to measure interregional trade in value added 
and water in Morocco, while Section 5 concludes. 
 
2. Dimensions of Regional Disparities in Morocco 
2.1. The Geography of Water Resources 
 

Located  in  Northern  Africa,  bordering  the  Mediterranean  in  the  north  and  the  Atlantic 
Ocean in the west, Morocco is characterized by diversified reliefs ranging from the mountains in 
the Rif and the Atlas, passing through plains and central plateaus, and ending in the south in a vast 
desert area. The heterogeneity observed at the level of the reliefs in Morocco has predestined the 
country to have a temperate climate marked by contrasts in space and time, and associated with 
increasing scarcity of water resources. 

These natural physical constraints have forced the country to create the capability of storing 
water during periods of abundant rainfall for use during periods of scarcity, and to transfer water 
from  the  surplus  basins  of  the  northwest  to  the  deficit  basins  of  the  center  and  the  south.  This 
mechanism allows the government to design an integral development plan for all regions of the 
country  taking  into  consideration  different  dimensions  of  regional  disparities.  Moreover,  these 
natural complexities are exacerbated by excessive evaporation, extensive evapotranspiration and 
also frequent periods of droughts that result from the impacts of climate variability, which tend to 
become even more intense in the context of global climate change. 

Marked by evident space-temporal variability, rainfall in Morocco is gradually becoming 
scarce, going eastwards in the Mediterranean zone and towards the south in the Atlantic zone. In 
fact,  the average annual  national  rainfall varies from  500-1000 mm in  the northwest  part  of the 
country to less than 100 mm in the arid zones: (i) greater than 800 mm in the most rich area in 
terms of water resources located in the northwest; (ii) from 600 to 800 mm in the north and the 
Atlas zone; (iii) from 400 to 600 mm in the Sebou, Bouregreg and Oum Rbia areas; (iv) from 200 

3 

to 400 mm in the Tensift, Souss Massa and the Oriental areas; and (v) less than 200 mm in the 
southern Atlas areas and the Sahara. 

According to the inventory of water resources in Morocco, it is estimated that 22 billion 
cubic  meters  of  water  can  be  mobilized  of  which  18  billion  are  surface  water  and  4  billion  are 
extracting  from  groundwater  (Table  1).  In  addition,  close  to  60%  of  the  country’s  mobilizable 
surface water resources are located in the Atlantic and central basins, which account for less than 
one fifth of the territory. In contrast, the Saharan basins, which cover half of the country, account 
for less than 6% of total surface water availability.

Finally,  as  far  as  groundwater  is  concerned,  the  exploitable  potential  of  groundwater 
amounts  to  about  4  billion  m3  per  year.  Throughout  the  Moroccan  territory,  more  than  78 
groundwater wells are identified. These water resources constitute an important part of the national 
water heritage and sometimes represent the only water resources of the desert regions. Although 
very rare, these resources participate actively to the economic development of the Saharan areas. 
 
2.2. The Geography of Economic Activity 
 

The use of a regionalization based on river basins is fundamental for studies dealing with 
impact  assessment  of  the  use  of  water  resources  on  their  availability  to  extract  measures  of 
sustainability  (Visentin,  2017).  Nonetheless,  regionalization  issues  arise  when  one  attempts  to 
integrate other quantifiable dimensions for which data are collected under different geographical 
definitions. This is the case for regional economic statistics in Morocco, which are available for 
administrative divisions whose limits differ from those of the river basins. Given the twelve-region 
setting of the IIOM-MOR, and the nine-basin setting of the Moroccan watershed system, a one-to-
one  mapping  is  not  available.  Thus,  a  different  regional  perspective,  based  on  administrative 
regions, will permeate the forthcoming analysis, to be also used throughout the rest of the paper. 

Information  on  the  regional  distribution  of  population  and  GDP  (Table  2)  shows  Grand 
Casablanca-Settat as the prime region of the country. It concentrates 20% of the population and 
30% of national GDP. Asymmetries in the distribution of the productive activity, with the primacy 
of Casablanca, serve to strengthen existing competitive advantages. Higher productivity levels are 
perceived  mainly  in  the  two  largest  urban  agglomerations  of  the  country,  which  present  higher 
GDP shares than population shares. In a broader territorial context, the presence of other relevant 
industrial  areas  outside  Casablanca  reveals  the  economic  core  of  the  Moroccan  economy

comprising  six  of  the  twelve  regions,  namely,  Tanger-Tetouan-Al  Hoceima  (R1),  Fès-Meknès 
(R3),  Rabat-Salé-Kénitra  (R4),  Béni  Mellal-Khénifra  (R5),  Grand  Casablanca-Settat  (R6)  and 
Marrakech-Safi (R7), which, together, are responsible for over 80% of the GDP. Given the fish-
shaped-like cartographical representation of the territorial limits of this cluster, this set of regions 
is referred to as “the fish” (Figure 1).

The IIOM-MOR is calibrated for 2013 and considers 12 regions and 20 sectors. Figure 2 
shows, in monetary terms, how the flows of goods and services for production take place among 
the Moroccan regions: columns refer to the buying sectors and regions, and rows refer to the selling 
sectors  and  regions.  The  figure  shows  that,  in  productive  terms,  five  relatively  more  integrated 
regions,  all  of  them  part  of  the  “fish”,  concentrated  most  of  the  flows:  Casablanca,  Rabat, 
Marrakech, Fès-Meknès, and Tanger. As Table 3 indicates, these regions were responsible for more 
than 75% of the total output value of the Moroccan economy in 2013. For the remaining regions, 
there is practically little integration among them, with the production linkages taking place mainly 
inside each one of them, with some trade with Casablanca.

Table  3  presents  the  regional  output  shares  for  the  regions  in  Morocco.  Casablanca 
dominates  the  national  production,  with  a  share  of  35.7%  in  total  output,  followed  by  Rabat 
(13.0%), Marrakech (9.9%), Fès-Meknès (9.2%) and Tanger (8.8%). The regional output shares by 
sectors in Morocco reveal some evidence of spatial concentration of specific activities: agriculture 
in Fès-Meknès, Marrakech, Rabat, Casablanca, and Béni (69.7% of total output); fishing in Souss-
Massa,  Dakhla-Oued  Eddahab,  Guelmin-Oued  Noun  and  Laayoune-Sakia  Le  Hamra  (79.0%); 
mining in Béni and Marrakech (78.0%), manufacturing in Casablanca, where at least 50% of the 
output is generated for each of the sectors. Some regions play important roles in the production of 
specific  manufacturing  sectors,  such  as  food  industry  in  Souss-Massa  (12.6%)  and  Fès-Meknès 
(9.9%); textile and leather in Tanger (21.3%) and Fès-Meknès (11.3%); and mechanical, metal and 
electrical  products  in  Tanger  (26.4%).  Services,  in  general,  are  concentrated  in  Rabat  and 
Casablanca. However, Marrakech and Souss-Massa concentrate the major part of tourism services 
(36.8% and 26.4%, respectively). 

Table 4 shows the sectoral shares in regional output, revealing the important role of some 
activities in relatively specialized regions: the dominant role of agriculture in Drâa-Tafilalet (27.5% 
of total regional output), Béni (25.6%) and Fès-Meknès (21.7%); fishing in Dahla-Oued Eddahab 
(38.6%); mining in Béni (21.%); food industry in Souss-Massa (21.1%); and the relevance of the 
public  administration  in  the  more  remote  regions  of  the  south:  Guelmin-Oued  Noun  (28.0%), 
Laayoune-Sakia Le Hamra (27.7%) and Dakhla-Oued Eddahab (20.7%). 

Relative  regional  specialization  can  also  be  assessed  by  the  calculation  of  the  sectoral 
location  quotients,  as  presented  in  Table  5.  The  highlighted  cells  identify  sectors  relatively 
concentrated in specific regions, i.e. sectors for which their share in total regional output is greater 
than the respective shares in national output (location quotient greater than unit).

Methodology 
 

The analysis in the previous section has revealed distinct spatial regimes associated with 
both the geography of water resources and the geography of economic activity in Morocco. On one 
hand,  the  climate  divide,  heavily  influenced  by  the  physical  barrier  established  by  the  Atlas 
mountain range, affects regional water availability, creating regionally differentiated comparative 
advantage  on  water-resource-intensive  sectors.  On  the  other  hand,  the  regional  distribution  of 
economic activity and population creates a complex structure of supply and demand in space that 
helps shaping the geography of trade flows and domestic value chains (Meng et al., 2017). 

In a context in which interregional physical transfers of water do not suffice to respond to 
specific regional needs, what role do virtual water trade flows play? Coming up with appropriate 
methods to measure interregional trade in water may be deem important for water management in 
a country like Morocco, characterized by a very heterogeneous availability across its regions. Thus, 
in this Section, we describe the methodology to be applied in the calculation of our trade-based 
index  of  water  intensity.  It  takes  into  consideration  important  elements  of  an  integrated 
interregional  system  and  the  demand  of  natural  resources,  namely  information  on  the  adopted 
technology by different sectors in the form of input-output linkages, the specific regional economic 
structures, the structure of interregional and international  trade flows, and  information  on water 
consumption by sectors. 
 
3.1. Background 
 

Los et al. (2016) have proposed a decomposition of gross exports based on the “hypothetical 
extraction” (HE) methodology, which allows verifying how much domestic value added is included 
in  a  country’s  exports.  They  have  provided  a  measurement  of  domestic  value  added  in  exports 
based on global and national input-output tables. 

In the case of national interregional input-output tables, with n regions, the ideal framework 
to evaluate the domestic value added in exports would be to have a global input-output table where 
the national system is inserted in a global multi-regional model. However, such a system would 
demand a large amount of information, such as trade flows from each sector in each region to each 
sector in the Rest of the World (RoW) and vice versa. Thus, given the scarcity of these data, we 
will follow an alternative approach in which we will consider the RoW as an exogenous region, 
i.e. as a column vector in the final demand of a national interregional system. 

Following  the  methodology  presented  by  Los  et  al.  (2016),  we  will  then  make  the 
calculation  of  domestic  value  added  in  exports  (DVA)  based  on  a  national  interregional  input-
output system with exports to the RoW exogenously specified. Furthermore, by the same logic, we 
will be able to measure domestic traded water in exports (DTW). Finally, using both measures, we 
will calculate a Trade-Based Index of Water Intensity. 
 
3.2. Measurement of Domestic Value Added in Exports 
 

The input-output model can be expressed by 

 

𝐱 = 𝐀𝐱 + 𝐟 
𝐱 = (𝐈 − 𝐀)−1𝐟 = 𝐋𝐟 

(1) 

(2) 

 
where  𝐱  and  𝐟  are  the  vectors  of  gross  output  and  final  demand;  𝐀  is  a  matrix  with  the  input 
coefficients (aij); 𝐈 is the identity matrix; and 𝐋 is the Leontief inverse.2 

Considering  a  national  interregional  input-output  model  with  n  different  regions  and  the 

RoW as a column vector in the final demand, (1) and (2) can be represented as

where 𝐢 is a column vector with all elements equal unity which sums all elements in each of the 
n+1 rows of the matrix 𝐟. 

Following Los et al. (2016), the value added in region 1 (𝐺𝐷𝑃1) can be expressed as 

 

𝐺𝐷𝑃1 = 𝐯1(𝐈 − 𝐀)−𝟏𝐟𝐢 

(5) 

 
where 𝐯1 is a row vector with ratios of value added to gross output in industries in region 1 as first 
elements (𝐯̃1) and zeros elsewhere (𝐯1 = [𝐯̃1 𝟎]); and 𝐢 is a column vector which all elements are 
unity. 

In order to attribute the amount of domestic value added in exports from region 1 to region 
n,  as  proposed  by  Los  et  al.  (2016),  we  consider  a  hypothetical  world  where  region  1  does  not 
export anything to region n. In this case, the new GDP or hypothetical GDP can be represented by 
 

𝐺𝐷𝑃1,𝑛

(7) 

(8) 

In addition, in order to attribute the amount of domestic value added in exports from region 
1 to the RoW, we consider a hypothetical world where region 1 does not export to the RoW. In this 
case, the hypothetical GDP can be represented as 
 

∗

𝐺𝐷𝑃1,𝑟𝑜𝑤

where 𝐀 is the original matrix with the input coefficients as in (5); and 𝐟1,𝑟𝑜𝑤

(10) 

From (5) and (6), we can define the domestic value added in exports (DVA) from region 1 

to region n as follows: 
 

∗  
𝐷𝑉𝐴1,𝑛 = 𝐺𝐷𝑃1 − 𝐺𝐷𝑃1,𝑛

 
and, from (5) and (9), we can define DVA in exports from region 1 to the RoW as 
 

𝐷𝑉𝐴1,𝑟𝑜𝑤 = 𝐺𝐷𝑃1 − 𝐺𝐷𝑃1,𝑟𝑜𝑤

∗

 

 

(11) 

(12) 

Similarly, we can attribute the amount of domestic value added in exports from region 1 to 
all regions (2, 3, …, n), and from each region to the n-regions (1, 2, …, n), excluding itself. We 
can also attribute the DVA from each region to the RoW. In this sense, in an interregional system 
with n regions and the RoW exogenous, we have n DVA in exports for each region, as illustrated 
in Table 5.

3.3. Measurement of Domestic Traded Water in Exports 
 

Following the logic of the GDP, we can determine the total traded water (TTW) in region 

1 as 
 

𝑇𝑇𝑊1 = 𝐰1(𝐈 − 𝐀)−𝟏𝐟𝐢 

(13) 

 
where 𝐰1 is a row vector with water use in industries in region 1 as first elements (𝐰̃1) and zeros 
elsewhere (𝐰1 = [𝐰̃1 𝟎]); and 𝐢 is a column vector which all elements are unity. 

In order to attribute the amount of water in exports from region 1 to region n, we consider, 
similarly to (6), a hypothetical world where region 1 does not export anything to region n, which 
allows us to represent the hypothetical total traded water by 
 

𝑇𝑇𝑊1,𝑛

∗ = 𝐰1(𝐈 − 𝐀1,𝑛

∗ 𝐢 
∗ )−𝟏𝐟1,𝑛

 
where 𝐀1,𝑛

∗

 and 𝐟1,𝑛

∗  are expressed as (7) and (8), respectively. 

(14) 

And to attribute the amount of water in exports from region  1 to the RoW, we consider, 
similarly  to  (9),  a  hypothetical  world  where  region  1  does  not  export  anything  to  the  RoW, 
represented by 
𝑇𝑇𝑊1,𝑟𝑜𝑤

= 𝐰1(𝐈 − 𝐀)−𝟏𝐟1,𝑟𝑜𝑤

(15) 

𝐢 

∗

∗

 

11 

where 𝐀 is a matrix with the input coefficients as in (5); and 𝐟1,𝑟𝑜𝑤

∗

 is expressed as (10). 

From (13) and (14), we can define the domestic total traded water in exports (DTW) from 

region 1 to region n as 
 

∗  
𝐷𝑇𝑊1,𝑛 = 𝑇𝑇𝑊1 − 𝑇𝑇𝑊1,𝑛

(16) 

 
and, from (13) and (15), we can define the DTW in exports from region 1 to the RoW as 
 

𝐷𝑇𝑊1,𝑟𝑜𝑤 = 𝑇𝑇𝑊1 − 𝑇𝑇𝑊1,𝑟𝑜𝑤

∗

 

 

(17) 

In a similar fashion, we can attribute the amount of domestic total traded water in exports 
from  region  1  to  all  regions  (2,  3,  …,  n)  and  from  each  region  to  the  n-regions  (1,  2,  …,  n),

for each region, as illustrated in Table 6.

3.4. Trade-Based Index of Water Intensity 
 

The Trade-Based Index of Water Intensity (TWI) is based on the information on domestic 
value  added  in  exports  (DVA)  and  domestic  total  traded  water  in  exports  (DTW).  The  index 
calculation considers three steps. First, we calculate the relative importance of each domestic value 
added in export (𝐼𝐷𝑉𝐴) inside the whole economy by computing the ratio of each DVA to the sum 
of all of them, expressed as 
 

𝐷𝑉𝐴 =

In this case, we have n 𝐼𝐷𝑉𝐴 for each region, as illustrated in Table 7.

4. Analysis  
4.1. Data 
 

The methodology described in Section 3 relies on the use of an interregional input-output 
system linked to a water accounting system. We illustrate the calculation of the TWI using data for 
Morocco. We use the IIOM-MOR, a fully specified interregional input-output database estimated 
for 2013, together with total water sectoral use coefficients from Eora (Lenzen et al., 2012, 2013b).3 
Despite the fact that water consumption within a given activity differs across regions in Morocco 
(Schyns  and  Hoekstra,  2014),  data  availability  precludes  the  use  of  regionally  differentiated 
sectoral use coefficients in this study. 

In  Eora,  total  water  use  (in  m3),  or  total  water  footprint4,  is  available  for  26  Moroccan 
sectors5, and the information includes different components, namely, (i) water footprint by crop 
demand; (ii) water footprint of grazing (green water); (iii) water footprint of animal supply (blue); 
and  (iv)  water  footprint  of  industrial  production  and  water  footprint  of  domestic  water  supply 
(grey). The consolidated information is presented in Table 10, in which the adjusted coefficients 
are presented in m3 per million DHS. The top sector in terms of direct water use is Agriculture, 
forestry, hunting, related activities (A00), whose total water use is mainly concentrated in the crop 
water use component. Food industry and tobacco (D01) is also a heavy user, with important shares 
of crop water and blue water use. Other manufacturing, excluding petroleum refining (D05) is also 
an important user, dominated by the blue water use component.

3 Eora is a multi-region input-output table (MRIO) database that provides a time  series of high resolution IO tables 
with matching environmental and social satellite accounts for 187 countries.  
4 “The term ‘virtual water’ refers exclusively to indirect consumption, while the term ‘water footprint’ includes both 
direct use (e.g. turning on the faucet at home or drinking imported Perrier) and indirect use.” (Lenzen et al., 2013a). 
5 The version of the model used in this paper is Eora26 MRIO, which aggregates all countries to a common 26-sector 
classification and converts the supply-use tables from the full Eora MRIO to symmetric product-by-product IO tables 
using the Industry Technology Assumption. This version is compatible with the procedures used to build the IIOM-
MOR and a simple mapping was used to consolidate Moroccan data from the 26 sectors in Eora26 MRIO to the 20 
sectors in IIOM-MOR.

Results 
 

We have first computed the values of Table 6 (DTW), with the domestic total traded water 
in interregional and international exports originating in each of the twelve Moroccan regions. To 
grasp the relevance of each type of water use, we have decomposed total water use into its four 
different components according to information in Table 10. We have generated the results based 
on equations (16) and (17) by using such information to construct the row vectors of type t sectoral 
t. Aggregate results are presented in Figure 3 showing that the overall use 
water use in region r, 𝐰r
of domestic resources embodied in trade flows is mainly associated with crop water requirements 
(84.06% of total traded water), followed by the use of ground or surface water, i.e. blue water, that 
accounts for 15.38% of the total. 

 

Figure 3. Composition of Domestic Total Traded Water in Exports (DTW) 

 

We  can  map  the  results  obtained  from  Table  66  to  visualize  the  geography  of  domestic 
traded water in Morocco. Figure 4 depicts the “shipments” of virtual water from each origin to all 
destinations,  both  domestic  and  foreign.  It  also  shows  the  magnitude  of  the  flows  with  lines  of 
proportional thickness.  
 

Figure 4. Total Traded Water in Exports (DTW) 

 

 

 
We  have  also  computed  the  values  of  the  elements  presented  in  Table  5  (DVA),  which 
provide  the  estimates  of  the  value  added  content  in  each  export  flow  originating  in  Moroccan 
regions. Table 11 presents the aggregate results for both regional traded value added and regional 
total traded water embodied in regional exports, by main destinations. Overall, the amount of total 
water embodied in interregional exports surpasses that of foreign exports in the Moroccan case in 
                                                           
6 The forthcoming analysis is concentrated in total water use.

country. Nonetheless, this ratio varies across exporting regions, ranging from 0.3 in Dakhla-Oued 
Eddahab,  and  0.9  in  Laayoune-Sakia  El  Hamra,  both  regions  in  the  Sahara,  to  16.5  in  Grand 
Casablanca-Settat,  and  28.2  in  Rabat-Salé-Kénitra,  the  two  largest  urban  agglomerations  in 
Morocco. 

Comparing the regional share of value added in total exports to the regional share of total 
traded water, we see that the contributions to value added by Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra, Dakhla-
Oued  Eddahab,  Grand  Casablanca-Settat,  Tanger-Tetouan-Al  Hoceima,  and  Rabat-Salé-Kénitra 
exceed  their  respective  contributions  to  water.  As  described  in  Section  2,  these  regions  are 
associated with relative scarcity of water resources due to their structural characteristics. Relative 
abundance  (or  scarcity)  of  factors  of  production  may  arise  from  both  supply  and  demand 
considerations. In our case, the scarcity of water in the Sahara explains the results for Laayoune 
and Dakhla. In the case of the second subset of regions, associated with the cities of Casablanca, 
Tanger,  and  Rabat,  on  one  hand,  the  relative  scarcity  of  water  is  associated  with  high  levels  of 
demand due to urbanization and the important presence of manufacturing activities. On the other 
hand,  these  regions  face  strong  agglomeration  economies  that  potentially  generate  high 
productivity  levels  of  capital  and  labor,  partially  explaining,  from  the  supply  side,  the  relative 
higher value added shares in trade flows originating in these areas.  

This result is in agreement with the Heckscher-Ohlin model, which predicts patterns of trade 
and production based on the factor endowments of a trading region: each region exports the good 
that  makes  relatively  intensive  use  of  its  relatively  abundant  factor.  Differences  in  factor 
endowments  lead  to  differences  in  autarky  prices,  generating  comparative  advantage  to  regions 
where factors are relatively abundant. Since goods can be traded more cheaply than factors – factors 
are usually more costly to move – trade can at least partly alleviate factor scarcity. Thus, regions 
can import their scarce factor services embodied in goods. This seems to be the case in domestic 
trade within Morocco, when comparing the content of water in regional exports to that of aggregate 
payments to capital and labor (value added). 
 

Table 11. Regional Traded Value Added and Water in Exports, by Destination 

 

 

The  pattern  of  water  content  of  trade  within  Morocco  can  also  be  associated  with  the 
physical concepts of “water loss” and “water savings”, discussed in Hoekstra and Chapagain (2008, 
p. 39). Accordingly, whereas import of goods intensive in the use of water (see Table 10) implies 
regional water resources are saved, export of such goods entails the loss of regional water resources. 
That  is,  water  used  for  producing  commodities  that  are  consumed  in  other  regions  is  no  longer 
available  for  in-region  purposes.  Figure  5  presents  the  physical  balance  of  traded  water  by 
Moroccan region. The regions with the largest net water savings (deficit with other regions) are 
Grand  Casablanca-Settat  and  Tanger-Tetouan-Al  Hoceima,  followed  by  the  two  regions  in  the 
direct area of influence of the Saharan basins, namely Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra and Dakhla-Oued 
Eddahab. On the other hand, the regions with the largest net water loss (surplus with other regions) 
are in the direct area of influence of the water-rich basins of the Atlantic with a relevant presence 
of agricultural activities, namely Béni Mellal-Khénifra and Fès-Meknès.

Finally, based on the specification presented in Table 9, we have computed the Trade-Based 
Index of Water Intensity  (TWI), which reveals  the relative water use intensities associated with 
specific interregional and international export flows. We estimate, for trade flows associated with 
each origin-destination pair, measures of trade in value added and trade in water that were further 
used to calculate our index. The results are presented in Table 12 and point to different ratios across 
flows of share in total traded water to the respective share in total traded value added. Different 
patterns appear not only when international export flows are compared to domestic export flows, 
but when looking at trade flows within the country. 

The regional patterns of relative factor content in trade revealed by the TWI can be grasped 
by reading Table 12 in two different perspectives. First, going through the rows, one can verify that 
values for the TWI smaller than one relative to interregional trade prevail in regions that present 
relative scarcity of water resources – urban agglomerations of Rabat (R4) and Casablanca (R6), as 
well as the desert areas in the southern part of the country. In those cases, trade flows are relatively 
more concentrated in terms of value added than in water content. Second, as we look at the column 
results, we can conclude that (i) more water-intensive trade flows directed to the areas under the 
influence of the Sahara basins are spatially concentrated in Fès-Meknès, Béni Mellal-Khénifra and 
Drâa-Tafilalet,  that  benefit  from  their  relative  abundance  of  water  resources  and  their  strategic 
location to access the southern areas of the country; (ii) except for sales from Casablanca and Rabat, 
domestic trade within the “fish” area is dominated by more water intensive flows; and (iii) despite 
the documented fact that Morocco imports water in virtual form, more than it exports, so that in 
effect it partially depends on water resources from other countries (Hoekstra and Chapagain, 2009, 
p. 73), the above-unity TWI results in the RoW column suggest that international exports from Fès-
Meknès, Béni Mellal-Khénifra, Drâa-Tafilalet, and Souss-Massa are responsible, in relative terms, 
to put more pressure on the use of domestic water resources

Epilogue: Natural Resources Intensity 
 

We  have  focused  the  preceding  analysis  on  the  relative  intensity  in  the  use  of  water 
resources in regional supply chains, focusing on the water content in bilateral export flows from 
Moroccan regions. In what follows, we take structural elements of the Moroccan economy a step 
further in our analysis. The proposed index, TWI, can be compared to similar metrics related to 
other natural  resources.  Economic activity demand different  scarce  resources whose availability 
varies  across  regions  within  a  country.  By  using  information  on  sectoral  use  of  other  natural 
resources, the integrated water-economic analysis of regional supply chains that we have discussed 
can  be  expanded.  In  so  doing,  we  add  another  layer  of  complexity  to  a  system  of  resources 
management,  as  other  trade-offs  may  appear  involving  different  regional  actors.  Thus,  the 
forthcoming final analysis justifies the need for coordinated resources management systems. 

To illustrate this point, we will focus on CO2 emissions associated with energy use in the 
production process. Similarly to the calculation of the TWI, we calculate the TEI, the trade-based 
index of CO2 emission intensity, using information for the sectoral CO2 emission coefficients from 
Eora. Results are presented in Table 13. 
 

Table 13. Trade-Based Index of CO2 Emission Intensity (𝑻𝑬𝑰) 

 

 

The next step is to compare the TWI with the TEI. In this analysis, instead of examining 
differences in each single O-D pair, we compute the two indices for exports aggregated by the two 
main destinations, i.e. other Moroccan regions and other countries. We then present the results in 
Figure 6. In each of the scatter plots, the size of the “bubble” is proportional to the value added 
content in each export flow. The two axes cross at unity, the threshold value for both indices that 
indicate whether a particular trade flow from the region is more intensive in domestic total traded 
water (CO2 emissions) than in domestic value added. Thus, the interpretation of the location of the 
“bubbles” follows: (i) NE quadrant – relatively more intensive in the use of both natural resources; 
(ii)  SE  quadrant  –  relatively  more  intensive  in  the  use  of  water  resources;  (iii)  SW  quadrant  – 
relatively  less  intensive  in  the  use  of  both  natural  resources;  and  (iv)  NW  quadrant  –  relatively 
more intensive in the use of energy resources. 

We  can  divide  the  analysis  in  two  parts.  First,  regional  exports  to  other  regions  of  the 
country reveal the following: (i) domestic sales from Tanger (R1) are relatively more intensive in 
the use of both water and energy resources; (iii) exports from the Sahara regions (R11 and R12) 
present relative low levels of water use and emissions; moreover, trade flows from the main selling 
region  (Casablanca  –  R6)  are  dominated  by  relative  stronger  value  added  generation  when 
compared to their relative use of natural resources; (iii) the relative “clean” export flows, mainly 
from regions in the “fish” territory are relatively more intensive in the use of water  resources; and 
(iv)  sales  originated  in  Rabat  (R4)  are  more  intensive  in  the  use  of  energy  inputs  that  generate 
higher CO2 emissions.

the TWI and the TEI, evidencing another trade-off. The main export flows in value added terms 
are  concentrated  in  the  NW  quadrant,  revealing  a  relative  higher  intensity  in  the  use  of  CO2 
emissions generating energy inputs. On the other hand, export flows with low contribution to value 
added  generation,  mainly  located  in  the  SE  quadrant,  use  water  resources  relatively  more 
intensively.
