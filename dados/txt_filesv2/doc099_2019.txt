ABSTRACT 

This  paper  analyzes  the  effect  of  the  banking  market  structure  on  countries’  financial 
development. For this purpose, we use a dynamic panel with annual data, from 2006 to 2015, 
comprising 89 countries - 28 developed and 61 emerging. The structure of the banking market 
is measured with concentration (total assets of the largest banks in relation to total assets) and 
competition  (Lerner  and  Boone  indexes)  metrics.  As  proxies  for  measuring  financial 
development, we use the index developed by Sahay et al. (2015) and Svirydzenka (2016), which 
covers depth, access and efficiency aspects of the financial system. Moreover, domestic credit 
provided by the financial sector as a percentage of  gross domestic product, a long-stablished 
proxy  for  financial  development,  is  used.  The  main  results  indicate  that an  increase  in  bank 
concentration leads to a reduction in the country’s financial development, and that an increase 
in  competition  leads  to  an  increase  in  financial  development.  In  short,  an  improvement  in 
banking market structure (a decrease in concentration or an increase in competition) is relevant 
to financial development. This result is also verified for emerging countries. 

Key words: Banking Market Structure; Concentration; Competition; Financial Development.  

 

RESUMO 

Este artigo analisa o efeito da estrutura do mercado bancário no desenvolvimento financeiro 
dos  países.  Para  isso,  utilizamos  um  painel  dinâmico  com  dados  anuais,  de  2006  a  2015, 
composto por 89 países - 28 desenvolvidos e 61 emergentes. A estrutura do mercado bancário 
é  medida  com  base  em  indicadores  de  concentração  (ativos  totais  dos  maiores  bancos  em 
relação ao total de ativos) e competição (índices de Lerner e Boone). Como proxies para medir 
o  desenvolvimento  financeiro,  usamos  o  índice  desenvolvido  por  Sahay  et  al.  (2015)  e 
Svirydzenka  (2016),  que  abrange  aspectos  de  profundidade,  acesso  e  eficiência  do  sistema 
financeiro.  Além  disso,  é  utilizado  o  crédito  interno  fornecido  pelo  setor  financeiro  como 
porcentagem  do  produto  interno  bruto,  uma  proxy  estabelecida  há  muito  tempo  para  o 
desenvolvimento financeiro. Os principais resultados indicam que um aumento na concentração 
dos bancos leva a uma redução no desenvolvimento financeiro do país e que um aumento na 
competição leva a um aumento no desenvolvimento financeiro. Em resumo, uma melhoria na 
estrutura  do  mercado  bancário  (uma  diminuição  na  concentração  ou  um  aumento  na 
competição) é relevante para o desenvolvimento financeiro. Esse resultado também é verificado 
para países emergentes.

1. Introduction 
 

This  paper  investigates  the  simultaneous  effects  of  banking  concentration  and 
competition,  herein  denominated  banking  market  structure,  on  countries’  financial 
development. Using a dynamic panel of 89 countries  - 28 developed and 61 emerging  - with 
annual data over the period 2006-2015, our results suggest that banking market structure affects 
the level of countries’ financial development. In particular, an increase in bank concentration 
leads to a reduction of financial development. On the other hand, an increase in competition 
amplifies financial development. Moreover, we identify that an improvement in banking market 
structure  (a  decrease  in  concentration  or  an  increase  in  competition)  is  also  relevant  for  the 
financial development of emerging economies. 

The  works  that  investigate  the  relevance  of  financial  development,  since  Beck  et  al. 
(2000)  and  Levine  (2003),  find  a  positive  relationship  between  financial  development  and 
economic growth. Recently, studies involving income distribution  and financial development 
were embodied to the literature (Adu et al., 2013; Herwartz and Walle, 2014; Beck et al., 2014; 
Khoutem et al., 2014; Law and Singh, 2016; Durusu-Ciftci et al., 2016; and Azofra et al., 2018). 
At  present,  a  novel  branch  of  the  literature  studies  the  relationship  between  financial 
development  and  bank  behavior  (Sahay  et  al.,  2015  and  Svirydzenka,  2016).  Therefore, 
understanding the relationship between banking market structure and financial development is 
fundamental to expand the knowledge about the determinants of financial development. 

The main issue of banking market structure is about market power problems. However, 
literature  presents  mixed  empirical  evidence  of  the  relationship  between  competition  and 
stability.  From  the  competition-fragility  view,  as  Kasman  and  Kasman  (2015)  point  out, 
decreases in market power and profit margins, encouraging additional risk-taking, pose a threat 
to financial stability. Conversely, the competition-stability view holds that less banking market 
power  drives  the  cost  of  credit  down,  reducing  loan  default  rates,  which  benefits  banking 
stability (Fungácová, et al., 2017). 

From the effects of banking concentration standpoint, Fu et al. (2014) argue that greater 
concentration  fosters  financial  fragility,  considering  cross-country  data  from  Asia  pacific 
countries. On the one hand, Ben Ali, Intissar and Zeitun (2015) argue that concentration has a 
positive impact on financial stability through the profitability channel. Regarding the effects of 
banking  competition,  Amidu  and  Wolfe  (2013)  assert  that  competition  enhances  financial 
stability  in  developing  countries,  as  long  as  income  generating  activities  increase,  for  it  is 
identified as a channel through which competition affects banking insolvency risk. Consistent 
with this argument, Beck (2008) suggests that competition is not detrimental to banking system 
stability  in  a  market-based  financial  system  with  the  necessary  supporting  institutional 
framework and proper policies.  

The controversy between concentration and competition can be also present in the way 
banking  market  structure affects  financial  service  offers.  Cetorelli and  Gambera  (2001)  find 
evidence that banking concentration supports the growth of industrial sectors that need external 
financing, making it easier for young companies to access credit. Bara, et al. (2017) find that a 
reduction in banking concentration, as well as an increase in competition, stimulates growth.  

Although a concentrated banking sector can reduce competition through barriers to new 
entrants (which could expand financial services offer), it is also true that a concentrated banking 
sector can be competitive (Vives, 2016). In order to avoid the controversy, our paper chooses 
to  look  into  a  comprehensive  approach  of  the  relationship  between  concentration  and 
competition, which we refer as banking market structure, and financial development. Moreover, 
as the lack of financial development is a problem for emerging economies (Seven and Coskun, 

3 
 

2016),  we  provide  a  specific  analysis  of  the  effects  of  concentration  and  competition  on 
developing countries' financial development. 

The article is organized as follows.  In section 2, we present the data and discuss our 
empirical methodology. Section 3 presents our main results and section 4 draws the conclusion. 

 

2. Data and Methodology 
 

The  present  work  makes  use  of  annual  data  from  2006  to  2015,  according  to  data 
availability, in an unbalanced dynamic panel with 89 countries. The sample used to investigate 
the  effect  of  banking  market  structure  on  financial  development  consists  of  28  developed 
countries and 61 developing countries, which are reported in the appendix (table A1).  All data 
were  extracted  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  World  Bank  websites  and  the 
description of each variable associated with their respective source is detailed in table A2 in the 
appendix.  

The financial development measure used in this study is the financial institutions index 
(FI) developed by Sahay et al. (2015) and Svirydzenka (2016), which reflects three dimensions 
of financial development: depth, access and efficiency. The second measure used in this study 
is the domestic credit provided by the financial sector as a percentage of GDP (CRED_GDP), 
a long-stablished proxy for financial development commonly used in the literature (Beck et al., 
2000; Beck and Levine 2004). 

According  to  Seven  and  Coskun  (2016),  financial  development  presents  complex 
institutional  and  political  dimensions.  Therefore,  the  influence  of  banking  concentration,  as 
well  as  competition,  on  financial  development  could  be  different  depending  on  country 
characteristics. This reasoning provides the motivation for a second analysis, which highlights 
the effects of banking market structure on the financial development of developing countries. 
Accordingly, the average financial development (FI) in developed countries is  higher than in 
developing  ones,  as  the  descriptive  statistics  across  the  samples  analyzed  shown  in  Table  1 
reveal.

As stated by Berger et al. (2004), the consolidation of banks around the world intensified 
the  debate  about  the  effects  of  concentration  and  competition  on  banks'  performance.  In 
accordance with this argument, this study used two variations of the largest banks’ total assets 
as measures of banking concentration. Following Kasman and Kasman (2015), the first measure 
aggregates  the  assets  of  the  five  largest  banks  (Bank_5),  while  the  second  measure,  derived 
from  Fu et al. (2014), aggregates the assets of the three largest banks in relation to the total 
assets of commercial banks (Bank_3). Regarding competition  measures, this study  resorts to 
measures often used in the literature, such as the Lerner and Boone indexes. The Lerner index 
is a measure of "market power" (Demirgüç-Kunt and Martínez Pería, 2010). Hence, the greater 

4 
 

the  "market  power",  the  lower  the  competition.  The  Boone  index  measures  the  degree  of 
banking competition from the elasticity of profits to marginal costs, as Kasman and Kasman 
(2015) point out. The reasoning that underpins the indicators is that higher profits are achieved 
by  more  efficient  banks.  Therefore,  an  increase  in  the  Boone  and  Lerner  indexes  reflects  a 
hindrance to financial intermediaries’ competition. 

In  order  to  control  the  effect  of  banking  concentration  and  competition  on  financial 
development, we used banking and macroeconomic variables. For that, we followed Kasman 
and Kasman (2015) and used the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to capture the relation 
between credit  risk  and  financial  development.  The capital adequacy  ratio  (CAR)  is  used  to 
capture  the  trade-off  between  financial  stability  and  financial  development.  CAR  is  an 
international  standard  that  measures  a  bank’s  risk  of  insolvency  from  excessive  losses  and 
equals the equity divided by the risk-weighted assets (De Moraes, Antunes and Montes, 2016). 
From financial development literature, the following macroeconomic variables are used: real 
interest rate (INTR), Bara et al. (2017) use this variable as control in a model whose dependent 
variable  is  financial  development;  annual  GDP  growth  rate  (GDP)  based  on  constant  local 
currency  (Raza et al., 2014) and, concordantly with Chinn, Menzie and Ito (2006) the inflation 
rate (INFL). Descriptive statistics of variables used are reported below, in Table 2. Finally, to 
capture the effects of the subprime crisis on financial develpment, the dummy CRISIS assumes 
value 1 for years 2008 and 2009 and 0 elsewhere.

The  use  of  the  dynamic  panel,  in  which  the  lagged  dependent  variable  is  used  as  an 
explanatory  variable,  allows  to  analyze  the  banking  market  structure  effect  on  financial 
development controlled by the persistence effect (De Mendonça and De Moraes, 2018). This is 
possible because the lagged financial development possesses large part of the explanation of 
financial development. Therefore, the current degree of financial development is expected to 
be  affected  by  past  financial  development  as  well as  by  lagged  banking  variables  (NPL  and 
CAR) and lagged macroeconomic variables (INTR, GDP and INFL). Hence, we estimate the 
following specification: 

 

5 
 

𝑭𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒍 𝒅𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒍𝒐𝒑𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊,𝒕 =   𝜷𝟎   +   𝑭𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒍 𝒅𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒍𝒐𝒑𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊,𝒕−𝟏 +
𝑩𝒂𝒏𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒎𝒂𝒓𝒌𝒆𝒕 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒄𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆𝒊,𝒕−𝟏 +   𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒐𝒍𝒔𝒊,𝒕−𝟏 +   𝑪𝒓𝒊𝒔𝒊𝒔𝒊,𝒕 +   𝜺𝒊,𝒕        (𝟏)   

 

Where  𝑖 = 1,2,3, … ,89  are  the  countries  and  𝑡 = 1,2,3, … ,9  is  the  period  in  years;  
𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 is a  vector of financial development proxies, such as  FI (financial 
development  index)  and  CRED_GDP  (domestic  credit  provided  by  the  financial  sector  as  a 
percentage of GDP);  𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 is the set of interest variables associated 
with banking concentration (Bank_5 and Bank_3) and banking competition (Lerner and Boone 
indexes); 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠 is the set of lagged banking and macroeconomic control variables: NPL, 
CAR, INTR, GDP and INFL; 𝐶𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑠   is the dummy variable to capture the subprime crisis and 
𝜀 is the residual of the estimation. 

Despite this advantage, the use of the lagged dependent variable in the models generates 
bias and inconsistency. To avoid correlation issues between the explanatory variables and the 
error, resulting in biased and inconsistent estimates, the study makes use of the systemic GMM 
(S-GMM),  which  resorts  to  instrumental  variables  to  address  possible  endogeneity  issues 
(Arellano  and  Bover,  1995).  With  the  purpose  of  avoiding  excess  of  instruments  in  the 
regressions,  harming  the  statistical  power  of  the  test,  the  amount  of  instruments  used  in  the 
study is smaller than the number of cross-sections. To confirm the validity of the estimations 
reported,  the  test  of  over-identifying  restrictions  (J-test)  is  performed  (Arellano,  2003).  In 
addition,  the  first  and  second  order  serial  auto-correlation  tests  (AR1  and  AR2)  are  also 
performed. 

 

3. Empirical Analysis 

 

In this section, we analyze the effects of banking market structure on financial 

development. In particular, the analysis of the effect of concentration on financial 
development is presented on Tables 3, 4, 7 and 8, whereas the analysis of competition is 
displayed on Tables 5, 6, 9 and 10.  

 

3.1. Financial Development (FI) and Banking Concentration 
 

This section analyzes the effect of banking concentration on financial development (FI). 
Table 3 reports the results for the full sample, which comprises all the countries analyzed, and 
Table  4  presents  the  results  for  developing  countries.  In  general,  the  indicators  of  banking 
concentration  present  negative  signs  and  statistical  significance  in  all  models,  providing 
evidence that an increase in banking concentration (BANK_5, BANK_3) leads to a reduction 
in  financial  development. These  results  suggest  that  countries  with  a  large  amount  of  assets 
concentrated in a few banks (three or five in our analysis) constrain financial development, i.e., 
diminish the relevance, accessibility and efficiency of the countries' financial systems.  

The credit risk (NPL) presents negative signs and statistical significance in all models, 
implying that countries exposed to high credit risk may experiment low financial development. 
Since  banking  behavior  is  forward-looking  (De  Moraes,  Antunes  and  Montes,  2016),  the 
persistence  of  high  levels  of  NPL  may  discourage  banks  to  incur  in  additional  risk-taking, 
leading to low financial development. As for the CAR, the negative signs in all models suggest 
the existence of a trade-off between capital regulation, measured by the capital adequacy ratio, 

6 
 

and financial development. Hence, the more solvent the banks are, the higher the CAR and the 
lower the financial development. 

Regarding  the  macroeconomic  variables,  the  signs  and  significance  of  the  GDP 
coefficients reveal a negative relationship between economic growth and financial development 
(FI),  both  in  the  full  sample  and  in  the  developing  countries  analysis.  In  terms  of  inflation 
(INFL) and the interest rate (INTR), the full sample analysis shows evidence that both variables 
curb financial development. Concerning the developing countries analysis, although INFL and 
INTR present negative signs in all the models, only the interest rate (INTR) is significant. These 
results are expected, for during periods of high interest rates financial development is curbed. 
Finally, the crisis dummy evidences that financial development is adversely affected by periods 
of crisis.

3.2. Financial Development (FI) and Banking Competition 
 
 
In this section we analyze the effect of banking competition (Lerner and Boone indexes) 
on financial development (FI). Table 5 reports the full sample results, where all countries are 
analyzed altogether, while Table 6 reports the results for the sample of developing countries. 

 
In  general,  the  coefficients  of  the  Lerner  index  present  negative  signs  and  statistical 
significance. Concerning the Boone index, the estimations involving developing countries show 
the expected sign and statistical significance. The negative relationship between the degree of 
competition  and  financial  development  indicates  that  an  economic  environment  of  higher 
competitiveness leads to a higher financial development. Thus, there is evidence that financial 
development can be fostered if greater incentives for competitiveness are provided. 

 
In most of the estimations, the NPL negative signs and statistical significance evidence 
that an increase in credit risk constrains financial development. It is also noteworthy that the 
negative  sign  and  statistical  significance  of  the  CAR  variable  in  the  developing  countries’ 
analysis  strengthens  the  existence  of  a  trade-off  between  capital  regulation  and  financial 
development.  At  last,  the  crisis  dummy  results  corroborate  the  effect  of  crises’  periods  in 
financial  development.  These  results  corroborate  the  findings  in  the  banking  concentration 
analysis. 

 

3.3. Credit, Concentration and Banking Competition 
 

The results obtained in the previous subsections indicate that banking market structure 
can constrain financial development. An increase in the banking market power derived from 
high  concentration  or  low  competition  can  harm  financial  development.  Therefore,  to 
corroborate these findings, Tables 7 to 10 present the estimates for the domestic credit provided 
by the financial sector as a percentage of GDP (CRED_GDP), a measure long-stablished in the 
literature (Levine, 2003). 

In  particular,  Tables  7  and  8  report  the  effect  of  banking  concentration  (Bank_5, 
Bank_3) on the CRED_GDP for the full sample and for the developing countries, respectively. 
The same goes for Tables  9 and 10, which report the effect of banking competition (Lerner, 
Boone indexes) on the CRED_GDP.

The statistical significance and negative signs of banking concentration and competition 
coefficients (Tables 7 to 10) indicate that high banking concentration, as well as low banking 
competition, reduces the availability of credit in the countries’ financial systems, measured by 
the CRED_GDP. These results suggest that an increase in banking market power can lead the 
financial  systems  to  credit  rationing,  shedding  light  on  the  credit  market  behavior  under  a 
banking market structure perspective. 

Regarding the banking variables, the NPL stands out both in the full sample and in the 
developing  countries  analysis.  There  is  evidence  that  an  increase  in  the  NPL  deprives  the 
amount of credit in the countries. With respect to CAR, which is a proxy for financial stability, 
the results emphasize the trade-off with financial development, proxied by the CRED_GDP. 

The  conclusions  concerning  the  effects  of  the  macroeconomic  variables  on  financial 
development  (CRED_GDP)  corroborate  the  conclusions  previously  obtained  for  FI.  In  this 
sense, the results indicate that increments of the interest rate may hinder financial development. 
The behavior of real interest rates is, to some extent, a reflection of monetary policy, which 
may  affect  the  amount  of  credit  in  the  economy.  The  coefficients  of  the  variable  INFL 
(inflation) also confirm the preceding results, suggesting that uncertainties generated by high 
inflation rates lag financial development. 

It  is  expected  a  positive  relationship  between  gdp  growth  and  credit  to  gdp  ratio. 
However, the negative effect of GDP on CRED_GDP, though not expected, can be explained 
by the reasoning that underpins the CRED_GDP. Therefore, an increase (reduction) in the gdp 
growth can lead to a reduction (increase) in the credit to gdp ratio. The CRISIS dummy, which 
captures the effects of the financial crisis in the period 2008/2009, holds the negative signs and 
statistical significance in most of the models, suggesting that financial development deteriorates 
during crises.  

Thus, the estimates for banking concentration and banking competition in relation to the 
credit to gdp ratio (CRED_GDP) for the full sample, as well as for the developing countries, 
corroborate the results obtained in the main analysis involving financial development (FI). In 
short,  banking  market  power  is  an  issue,  and  improvement  in  banking  market  structure  (a 
decrease in concentration or an increase in competition) is relevant to financial development.

4. Conclusion 
 

This paper analyzes, through a panel with 89 countries from 2006 to 2015, how financial 
development  reacts  to  banking  market  structure  (banking  concentration  and  banking 
competition).  The  main  results  are  that  a  greater  degree  of  banking  concentration  or  less 
competitive banking sector reduce countries’ financial development and the amount of credit 
supply. This is also true for emerging countries. These results suggest that the way the banking 
sector is structured is important for the financial  service offer in different kind  of countries. 
Therefore,  the  result  of  this  study  sheds  light  on  a  new  issue  of  banking  market  power:  a 
financial system concentrated or uncompetitive constrains financial development.

Table A 2 - Description of the variables and data sources 

Variable   Description 

FI 

Financial development index (Sahay, R. et al., 2015). This index was multiplied by 100, without prejudice to the values, only to facilitate the analysis of the results. 

CRED_GDP 

Domestic credit provided by the financial sector (% GDP). It is used as a proxy for financial development measure. Series code FS.AST.DOMS.GD.ZS 
FS.AST.DOMS.GD.ZS. 

BANK_5 

BANK_3 

LERNER 

BOONE 

NPL 

CAR 

Assets of the five largest banks as a percentage of total assets of commercial banks. This measure is used as a proxy for banking concentration. Series code 
GFDD.OI.06. 
Assets of the three largest banks as a percentage of the total assets of the commercial banks. This measure is used as a proxy for banking concentration. Series code 
GFDD.OI.01 
The Lerner index is defined as the difference between price and marginal cost, divided by price. It indicates the effective behavior of the banks by measuring a bank's 
ability to set its price above the marginal cost and therefore the market power of the bank individually. This index is used as a proxy for bank competition. 
LERNER's higher values indicate less competition. This index was multiplied by 100, without prejudice to the values. Series code GFDD.OI.04. 

This index is a measure of the degree of bank competition, calculated as the elasticity of profits relative to marginal costs. The rationale behind the indicator is that 
higher profits are achieved by more efficient banks. An increase in the Boone index indicates an inhibition of the competitive conduct of financial intermediaries. 
This index was multiplied by 100, without prejudice to the values. Only for easy analysis of results. Series code GFDD.OI.05. 

Bank Nonperforming Loans to Total Loans (%). Loan to arrears ratio (interest and capital payments due 90 days or more) on total gross loans (total value of the loan 
portfolio). The amount of the loan recorded as a default includes the gross amount of the loan recorded in the balance sheet, not just the amount in arrears. Series 
code GFDD.SI.02 

Bank Regulatory Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets (%). It is treated as a solvency indicator of a financial institution. The indicator is calculated by dividing the 
reference equity by the assets weighted by the risk. Series code GFDD.SI.05. 

INTR 

Real interest rate. The real interest rate is the inflation-adjusted interest rate of loans measured by the GDP deflator. Series code FR.INR.RINR. 

GDP 

INFL 

Annual percentage growth rate of GDP at market prices based on constant local currency. Aggregates are based on constant 2010 U.S. dollars. GDP is the sum of 
gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated 
without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Series code NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG. 

Inflation as measured by the consumer price index reflects the annual percentage change in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and 
services that may be fixed or changed at specified intervals, such as yearly.   Series code FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG.
