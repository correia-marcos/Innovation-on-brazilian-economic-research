ABSTRACT 
This paper studies the usefulness of factors models in explaining the dynamics of the exchange rate Real / 
Dollar from January 1999 to August 2011. The paper verifies that the inclusion of factors  embedded on 
the common movements of exchange rates of a set of countries significantly improves the in-sample and 
out-of-sample predictive power of the models comprising only macroeconomic fundamentals commonly 
used in the literature to forecast the exchange rate. The paper also links the information contained in the 
factors  to  global  shocks  as  the  demand  for  “dollars”  –  a  dollar  effect,  volatility,  and  liquidity  of  global 
financial markets.

RESUMO 
O trabalho estuda o papel de fatores comuns na dinâmica da taxa de câmbio Real / Dólar norte-americano 
no período de Janeiro de 1999 a Agosto de 2011. O trabalho verifica que a inclusão de fatores extraídos a 
partir dos movimentos comuns das taxas de câmbio de um conjunto de países melhora significantemente 
o poder preditivo dentro e fora da amostra dos tradicionais modelos macroeconômicos comumente usados 
para prever a taxa de câmbio. O trabalho também liga a informação contida nos fatores a choques globais 
tais como a demanda por “dólares” – Efeito dólar, volatilidade e liquidez dos mercados financeiros.

1.  Introduction 

Following  the  collapse  of  Bretton  Woods  in  the  beginning  of  the  1970s  and  the  adoption  of 
floating exchange  rate  regimes by  most developed countries, the  behavior  of exchange rates has been  a 
frequent  topic  of  analysis,  as  this  variable  exerts  a  significant  impact  on  countries’  trade  balance,  price 
levels, and output. Given the important role of the exchange rate on the economy, being able to forecast is 
of  great  relevance.  Unfortunately,  the  body  of  research  dedicated  to  analyzing  the  predictive  power  of 
exchange  rate  determination  models  has  reached  limited  success  in  forecasting  the  exchange  rate, 
especially  for  short  term  predictions.  This  difficulty  is  considered  one  of  the  major  weaknesses  of 
international macroeconomics (Bacchetta and Wincoop, 2006). 

Meese and Rogoff (1983), in their very influential work, verified the lack of predictive power of 
theoretical exchange rate models. They argued that little or no information about the future movement of 
exchange  rates  over  short  horizons  can  be  extracted  from  macroeconomic  variables  such  as  monetary 
aggregates,  price  levels,  output  gap,  or  interest  rates.  They  found  that  no  model  was  able  to  forecast 
significantly  better  than  a  simple  random  walk  model.  After  more  than  20  years,  Cheung,  Chinn,  and 
Pascual  (2005)  performed  a  similar  exercise  incorporating  models  developed  during  the  1990s  and 
applying new econometric techniques. The authors concluded that some models perform well for certain 
projections  or  specific  exchange  rates;  however,  their  results  do  not  identify  a  model  that  is  broadly 
consistent.2 Faust  et.  al.  (2003)  also  noted that most  of the works that  find that macroeconomic models 
outperform the random walk model are sensitive to the choice of horizons and sample periods.3 

In the last  years the literature has been discussing different  reasons  to  explain this instability on 
the forecasting of the exchange rate. From a theoretical point of view, one possible explanation for this 
fragility  in  forecasting  the  exchange  rate  would  be  the  way  the  exchange  rate  is  determined.  If  the 
exchange rate is the expected present discounted value of current and future fundamentals it is possible 
that the evolution of the exchange rate is affected not only by the dynamics of observables fundamentals 
like monetary aggregates, price level, or output, but also by unobservable variables such as risk premium 
or noise trading. As discussed by Engle, Mark, and West (2008), if these unobservable factors have little 
correlation with the observable, it reduces the predictive power of the models, leading to the weak results 
found  in the literature.4 Consistent with  this role of unobservable variables in  explaining movements  of 
the  exchange  rate,  Bachetta  and  Wincoop  (2004,  2011)  developed  the  scapegoat  theory.  The  theory 
asserts that if the dynamics of the exchange rate is partially given by unobservable variables, changes in 
the  expectations  of  the  agents  with  respect  to  the  structural  parameters  of  the  economy  generated  by 
shocks  on  these  unobservable  variables  will  generate  this  instability  on  the  relationship  between  the 
exchange rate and fundamentals.  

The question brought by the literature then is how we can capture these unobservable movements 
that have an impact in the dynamics of the exchange rate in order to deal with the issue of this instability 
in forecasting the exchange rate. Evans and Lyons (2002, 2005, 2008) and Chinn and Moore (2010) adopt 
a microstructure approach to the traditional macroeconomic models with  the objective of  answering the 
question.  In  these  papers,  the  inclusion  of  order  flow  variables  would  solve  the  problem  of  the 

                                                      
2  The  Brazilian  experience  mirrors  the  international  experience.  Muinhos,  Alves,  and  Riella  (2003)  found  that  models  incorporating 
uncovered interest rate parity outperformed the random walk model when describing the behavior of the Brazilian exchange rate from May 
1999  to  December  2001.  Yet,  Moura,  Lima,  and  Mendonça  (2008),  using  data  from  January  1999  to  December  2007,  conclude  that  only 
models that incorporate the Taylor rule outperformed the random walk model.  
3The  use  of  panel  techniques  to  forecast  exchange  rates  has  been  reaching  relative  success.  Applying  various  techniques,  Mark  and  Sul 
(2001)  and  Groen  (2005)  used  panels  from  various  countries  to  determine  the  co-integration  relationship  between  exchange  rates  and 
monetary fundamentals and used this relationship to successfully  forecast the exchange rate over long horizons. Similarly,  Galimberti and 
Moura (2013) show in a panel of emerging economies that a Taylor rule exchange rate model has out-of-sample exchange rate predictability.  
4Another explanation supplied by Engel and West (2005) is that if the exchange rate is determined by the present value deducted by future 
fundamentals and if at least one of the fundamentals possesses a  unit root and the discount factor is near 1, the exchange rate will  behave 
similarly to the random walk. They argue that within this framework, it would be very difficult for macroeconomic models to beat a random 
walk in forecasting the exchange rate.

conventional  models  because  these  variables  would  account  for  shocks  that  lead  to  instability  in  the 
relationship between the exchange rate and fundamentals.5  

This paper goes in a direction different from the microstructure approach. We use common factors 
that  are  extracted  directly  from  the  dynamics  of  the  exchange  rate  of  a  set  of  18  countries  in  order  to 
identify the unobservable component of the exchange rate dynamics. Two conditions are needed for the 
use of factor models to be helpful in forecasting the exchange rate. The first one is that the information 
embedded  in  the  common  movements  of  the  exchange  rates  of  various  countries  is  related  to  the 
unobservable variables and the second one is that these variables play a significant role in the dynamics 
of the exchange rate. The paper analyzes whether these conditions are satisfied by studying the dynamics 
of  the  exchange  rate  Brazilian  Real  to  the  U.S.  dollar  after  the  adoption  of  the  floating  exchange  rate 
regime in Brazil.  

The  advantage  of  factor  models  compared  to  the  microstructure  approach  is  that  they  might 
improve the predictive power of the models without losing their tractability. This is the case since factor 
models  allow  the  information  set  to  be  condensed  into  a  small  number  of  factors,  the  data  needed  for 
implementing  the  methodology  are  easily  obtained,  and  it  is  more  straightforward  to  establish  a  link 
between  the  estimated  factors  and  proxies  for  different  global  shocks  and  this  would  improve  our 
knowledge about the role played by different unobservable shocks in the dynamics of the exchange rate.6  
Factor  models  are  widely  used  to  forecast  macroeconomic  variables  (see  Forni  and  Reichlin 
(1998), Forni et al. (2000), Stock and Watson (2002) and Bai (2004)), but they are rarely used in the case 
of  exchange  rates.  Groen  (2006)  uses  a  dynamic  factors  model  to  identify  the  “exchange  rate  level 
dictated  by  fundamentals”  and  used  the  difference  between  this  value  and  the  exchange  rate  to 
successfully  forecast  the  exchange  rate  over  a  two-year  horizon.  Engel,  Mark,  and  West  (2008) 
constructed factors derived from the exchange rates of 17 countries and used these factors to forecast the 
exchange  rate  over  a  two-to-four-year  horizon.  The  authors  obtained  satisfactory  results  for  the  period 
between 1999 and 2007. 
 
The results in the paper confirm the usefulness of using factor models. The paper shows that the 
estimated factors are related to unobservable shocks, providing an economic meaning for the factors. The 
paper  links  the  estimated  factors  with  observable  variables  usually  used  as  proxies  for  several  global 
shocks. The paper shows that the information contained in the factors is related to common global shocks 
as the global demand for “dollars” – a dollar effect, volatility, and liquidity of global financial markets.  

Besides giving an economic interpretation for the factors, the paper shows that the inclusion of the 
factors  systematically  increases  the  in-sample  and  out-of-sample  predictive  power  of  the  models  that 
contain  only  the  macroeconomic  variables,  traditionally  used  to  forecast  the  exchange  rate.  The  results 
indicate  that  the  factors  carry  useful  information  for  forecasting  the  exchange  rate  and  are  crucial  to 
understanding the dynamics of the exchange rate.  
 
The present study is organized as follows: the following section shows the data used in the paper. 
Section 3 describes the exchange rate model used in the paper and the estimation of the common factors. 
Section 4  studies the links between the common factors and different  global  shocks. Section 5  presents 
the results of the in-sample and out-of-sample exercises. Section 6 concludes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                      
5  One  possibility  discussed  by  the  microstructure  approach  literature  is  that  order  flow  variables  carry  private  information  that  becomes 
embedded in the exchange rate.  
6 It is worth noting that the microstructure approach and factor models are not competing methodologies. It is possible that two approaches 
capture  similar  features  of  the  data.  Depending  on  the  availability  of  the  data  and  their  periodicity  it  might  be  the  case  that  one  has  an 
advantage  compared  to  the  other.  In  this  sense,  these  are  complementary  approaches  with  the  intention  to  capture  useful  information  to 
understand the dynamics of the exchange rate that is not contained in the macroeconomic fundamentals.

2. Data  

We use monthly data from January 1999 to August 2011. The data starts in January 1999, since 
this  was  the  date  when  Brazil  adopted  a  floating  exchange  rate  regime.  The  exchange  rates  used  to 
construct  the  factors  are  from  countries  with  de  facto  floating  exchange  rate  regimes  and  independent 
monetary  policies, according to  the  International  Monetary Fund  classification. The following  countries 
and  economic  alliances  met  the  selection  criteria:  Australia,  Canada,  Chile,  South  Korea,  Philippines, 
England,  Iceland,  Israel,  Japan,  Mexico,  New  Zealand,  Norway,  Poland,  South  Africa,  Sweden, 
Switzerland,  Turkey,  and  the  Euro  Zone.  We  used  exchange  rates  from  the  end  of  the  month.  All 
exchange rates are relative to the U.S. dollar and follow the convention of local currency quantity per unit 
of foreign currency.  

The choice of the macroeconomic fundamentals included in the estimations is made according to 
the  extensive  body  of  literature  related  to  the  prediction  of  exchange  rates  using  macroeconomic 
fundamentals. The monetary model links the exchange rate with money supply and output differentials. 
The Taylor rule models view the interest rates, and not monetary aggregates, as the instruments used for 
conducting  monetary  policy.7  Hence,  we  also  include  inflation  differential  and  the  output  gap  in  our 
estimations. The purchasing power parity is also viewed as a model for the determination of the exchange 
rate.  Therefore,  the  dynamics  of  price  level  differences  are  also  included  as  a  macroeconomic 
fundamental  in  the  estimations.  In  all  specifications,  macroeconomic  fundamentals  are  measures  with 
respect to differences relative to U.S. fundamentals.   

The  Brazilian  economic  data  are  obtained  from  the  Brazilian  Central  Bank  (Banco  Central  do 
Brasil)  and  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics  (Instituto  Brasileiro  de  Geografia  e 
Estatística [IBGE]) database. Data for the U.S. are acquired from the Federal Reserve and the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics indicator databases. 

The accumulated inflation over 12 months is used and is based on the Brazilian national consumer 
price index (Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor [IPCA]) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for 
urban  consumers  in  the  U.S.  Both  indices  are  seasonally  adjusted.  Price  levels  are  given  by  the 
accumulation  of  the  monthly  inflation  for  these  same  indices,  with  a  base  of  100  in  January  1990. 
Regarding the currency, the monthly M1 is used for both the U.S. and Brazil. 

The seasonally adjusted  monthly industrial production is used as a proxy for the output, and the 
output gap is estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott  filter. Although the use of industrial production as  a 
proxy for GDP represents only a portion of  the total economic activity, this approximation  is necessary 
because the low frequency of the GDP data (quarterly) would significantly reduce the sample size. Given 
the  relatively  short  history  of  floating  exchange  rates  in  Brazil,  the  use  of  monthly  data  is  appropriate. 
Except when it is mentioned, all variables are in logarithms.  

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the exchange rate of the Brazilian Real to the U.S. Dollar in the 
period  of  interest.  The  trajectory  of  the  exchange  rate  can  be  divided  into  two  different  periods.  From 
January  1999  to  2003,  when  after  a  speculative  attack  Brazil  abandoned  a  crawling-peg  exchange  rate 
regime  and  adopted  a  floating  exchange  rate  regime.  During  this  period,  the  domestic  currency 
depreciated,  markedly  suffering  from  several  episodes  of  large  devaluation  with  brief  periods  of 
tranquility.  Beginning  in  2003,  there  was  more  stability  in  the  evolution  of  the  exchange  rate  with  a 
continuous trend of appreciation of the domestic currency, only interrupted by the global financial crisis 
of  2008  that  resulted  in  a  rapid  and  acute  devaluation  of  the  Brazilian  currency,  a  movement  that  was 
reversed throughout 2009 and 2010.

3. Exchange Rate Model 

The following exchange rate determination model is considered as our baseline specification:  

                                                                                                                                                     (1) 
Where     are changes in the (log-)nominal exchange rate,    is the set of common global factors, 
which are estimated in order to capture the dynamics of the unobservable variables, and    is the set of 
macroeconomic fundamentals (all variables in log-differences).  
The literature discusses several details with respect to the estimation of exchange rate models that 
 
led us to focus in models like (1) to analyze the usefulness of the factors. First, since conventional tests 
usually do not reject the presence of unit root in the variables, one could use a model in levels instead of 
differences  (error-correction  models).    Ferraro,  Rogoff  and  Rossi  (2012)  argue  that  error-correction 
models  supply  more  gains  for  lower  than  for  higher  frequencies.  Given  that  exchange  rate  forecast  is 
more difficult for higher frequencies we rather use models like in (1). In addition, Chen, Rogoff and Rossi 
(2010)  argue  that  models  like  (1)  are  more  appropriate  than  error-correction  models  when  one  is  not 
testing any specific model but only the predictive power of a variable, exactly the case here with respect 
to the estimated common factors.8  Finally, a specification like in (1) is consistent with the view that the 
exchange rate is  given by  the present  value of future fundamentals  as demonstrated by Engel  and West 
(2005) and Bacchetta and Wincoop (2011).9 
 
3.1 Extracting the Common Factors 

3.1.1 Baseline Framework 
The common factors are extracted from a panel  of 18 exchange rates.  Some econometric issues 
arise for the estimation of the factors. Cayen et. al. (2010) analyze two main methodologies to identify the 
comovements  among  the  exchange  rates:  factor  analysis  and  state-space  modeling.  The  authors  discuss 
the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  each  methodology.  They  show  that  the  results  are  identical 
regardless  of  the  method  used  for  the  identification  of  the  factors,  with  no  one  methodology  having  a 
clear advantage compared to the other.  In order to keep the simplicity and the focus of the paper in the 
usefulness of the factors we perform a factor-analysis estimation where an n-orthogonal factor model is 
estimated.  

The  determination  of  the  number  of  factors  is  done  using  two  different  criteria:  the  Kaiser-
Guttman  and  Bai  and  Ng  (2002).  In  the  first  criterion,  we  consider  only  factors  whose  associated 
eigenvalues  are  larger  than  1.  In  the  Bai  and  Ng  (2002)  criterion  the  number  of  factors  is  chosen  to 
minimize  a  loss  function  based  on  mean  square  deviations  of  the  changes  of  the  exchange  rate  and  the 

                                                      
8 Chen and Rogoff (2003) discuss the difficulties in using error-correction models in order to test exchange rate models.  
9 Note that unlike Fratscher, Sarno and Zinna (2012), we consider that the coefficients are not time-varying. The idea is to analyze whether 
the inclusion of the common factors per se is able to impose a more stable relationship between the exchange rate and the fundamentals.

estimated factors. Results show that both criteria indicate that N=3 factors are driving the dynamics of the 
exchange rate in our sample.10 Figure 2 shows the trajectory of the estimated factors.  

 

Figure 2 – Evolution of the Common Factors 
Figure  2  refers  to  the  evolution  of  the  estimated  factors.  For  each  country  i  we  have                   
       .  The  factors  shown  are 
cumulated from  first differences. The estimates  follow the standard case  for this study  using 152 monthly samples and 18 exchange rates, 
and the factors are estimated by maximum likelihood.

Figure 3 shows the percentage of the variance of the exchange rate that is cumulative explained by 
the first n estimated factors for the complete sample (1999–2011). The figure indicates that the first three 
factors jointly explain approximately 62% of the variability in the data with the three factors explaining, 
respectively, 46%, 10% and 6% of the variability in the data.

4.   Identification of the common factors 

One  of  the  main  criticisms  of  factor  models  is  that  in  most  cases  the  estimated  factors  lack  an 
economic  interpretation.  This  identification  is  important  since  it  can  help  in  improving  the  theoretical 
macroeconomic models that are traditionally used to study the exchange rate determination. 

Usually the literature tries to identify the factors through the inspection of the estimated loadings. 
Initially,  we  followed  this  procedure.  Results  in  table  1  indicate  that  the  factor  1  has    significant  and 
positive loadings in all of the currencies used. The factor is a weighted mean of all of the exchange rates. 
This  fact  allows  us  to  interpret  the  factor  as  reflecting  the  common  movements  of  the  currencies  with 
respect to the reference currency. Therefore, factor 1 can be viewed as indicating the strength (weakness) 
of the dollar against the  average of the other currencies  –  A Dollar effect. The dynamics of this factor, 
shown in figure 2, corroborates this explanation. From 1999 to 2001, a period when the dollar appreciated 
                                                      
10 Eigenvalues are 8.357, 1.797 and 1.007.  

6 

 

 

 
 
against almost all currencies, there was an increase in the factor, in opposition, between 2002 and 2008, a 
period  when  the  dollar  depreciated  compared  to  most  of  currencies  in  the  sample,  figure  2  indicates  an 
almost  continuous  decrease  of  the  factor.  Due  to  the  appreciation  of  the  dollar  relative  to  the  other 
currencies  during  the  financial  crisis,  there  was  an  increase  in  the  factor  in  200.  Finally,  beginning  in 
2009, when the dollar weakened again compared to the currency of the other countries, a reduction in the 
value of the factor took place as well.

In addition to the loadings, Table 1 also shows the results of the estimation of (1) for each country 
for a model containing only the estimated factors. Results for factor 1 confirm that this factor represent a 
“dollar  effect”.  Factor  1  has  a  positive  and  statistically  significant  impact  on  all  currencies.  It  is 
interesting to reinforce that factor 1 accounts for almost 50% of the variability of the exchange rates in the 
sample, as shown in figure 3.  

The  analysis  for  factor  2  indicates  a  division  of  the  impact  of  common  shocks  in  two  different 
groups of countries: developed and developing countries. Results in table 1 show that developed countries 
present a negative loading (and statistically significant impact) with Japanese yen and Swiss franc having 
the  highest  (negative)  impact  and  the  Mexican  Peso  and  Turkish  Lira  presenting  the  highest  (positive) 
loadings  and  estimated  coefficients  in  the  regression.    These  results  might  indicate  that  this  factor 
represents a possible “flight to quality” in moments of turmoil when capitals flow between the two groups 
of countries and we observe a disparity in the movements of the exchange rate. 

The  analysis  of  factor  3  is  more  emblematic  with  respect  to  the  difficulties  in  using  only  the 
analysis  of  the  loadings  for  assigning  an  economic  interpretation  for  the  common  factors.  It  is  not 
possible  to  verify  any  clear  pattern  among  the  loadings  or  in  the  coefficients  that  result  from  the 

7 

 

 

 
 
estimation of (1) for each country. Very dissimilar countries with respect to economic development have 
similar signs making its interpretation a difficult task.  

We turn then to another approach in order to assign an economic interpretation to the factors. We 
analyze the correlation between the factors and some observable variables usually considered by market 
participants  and  scrutinized  by  the  literature  as  exerting  an  influence  in  the  path  of  the  exchange  rate. 
These variables are frequently used as proxies for common global shocks as investors’ risk aversion, or 
liquidity  shocks,  among  other  possibilities.  This  methodology,  in  addition  to  help  in  the  economic 
interpretation of the factors, might reinforce a possible advantage of the use of factor models, that is, the 
concentration of the information set into a small number of factors.  

The empirical literature identifies different variables as correlated with common factors that have 
an  impact  in  the  trajectory  of  the  exchange  rate.  Cayen  et.  al.  (2010),  using  a  similar  factor  analysis, 
verify  a  correlation  between  commodity  prices  and  common  global  factors.  We  use  the  CRB  – 
Commodity Index in order to analyze this relationship.  

McGrevy et. al. (2012) identifies the euro/dollar, yen/dollar, and swiss-franc/dollar as the common 
factors.  They  argue  that  the  first  two  exchange  rates  are  the  two  highest  volume  of  foreign  exchange 
transactions in the spot markets and the Japanese yen and Swiss franc serve as “safe-haven” currencies in 
moments of turmoil in the U.S. Considering that anecdotal evidence indicates a correlation between gold 
prices  and  moments  of  turmoil,  since  gold  is  also  viewed  as  a  safe-haven  in  moments  of  turmoil  in 
financial markets, we analyze the correlation between gold-prices and the factors. Market participants use 
the High-yield spread as a proxy for risk aversion. Higher spreads indicate a lower desire by investor to 
bear risks. We include then the high yield spread in the analysis. 

Lustig et. al. (2011) found that a ‘slope’ effect account for more of the cross-sectional variation in 
average excess returns between high and low interest rate currencies. They relate these factors to global 
equity  market  volatility.  In  a  similar  way,  Menkhoff  et.  al.  (2012)  found  that  global  foreign  exchange 
volatility  risk  account  for  the  highest  explanation  of  cross-sectional  excess  returns  of  carry  trade 
portfolios  and  that  liquidity  risk  also  play  a  role  in  the  explanation  of  their  foreign  exchange  expected 
returns.  By  constructing  a  measure  of  FX  global  liquidity,  Banti  et.  al.  (2012)  show  that  there  is  a  link 
between  liquidity  across  currencies  and  that  liquidity  risk  is  priced  in  the  cross  section  of  currency 
returns. 

Given the possible role of common volatility and liquidity shocks in the dynamics of the exchange 
rate we analyze the correlation between the factors and different proxies for these common shocks.  The 
VIX  -  the  Chicago  Board  Options  Exchange  Market  Volatility  Index,  a  measure  of  the implied 
volatility of S&P 500 index options is used as our proxy for global volatility. For liquidity shocks we use 
the  TED  spread  and  the  stock  market  liquidity  measure  constructed  by  Pastor  and  Stambaugh  (2003).  
Table 2 reports the correlation matrix between the factors and all variables.  

 

Table 2 - Correlation Common Factors and Observable Variables 
Table  2  shows  the  correlation  between  the  estimated  common  factors  and  some  observable  variables  proxies  for  common  shocks  (all 
variables  in  log-differences).  CRB  is  the  CRB  commodity  price  index.    Gold  stands  for  the  spot  gold  prices.  VIX  stands  for  the  Chicago

Merrill Lynch US High Yield Spread. TED Spread is calculated by the difference between the interest rates on interbank loans and on short-
term  U.S.  government  debt.  Liquidity  is  the  stock  market  liquidity  calculated  by  Pastor  and  Stambaugh  (2003).  *  represents  5%  level  of

Results  in  table  2  show  that  factors  are  correlated  with  several  variables,  corroborating  the  idea 
that  the  factors  are  able  to  condense  information  from  a  set  of  observable  variables  that  is  frequently 
argued by market players and the international literature as playing a role in the exchange rate dynamics. 
The results in table 2 also highlight significant differences between the factors, especially with respect to 
their economic interpretation.  

The results indicate that factor 1 is highly correlated with the price of commodities. This is in line 
with  the  interpretation  that  factor  1  represents  the  strength  of  the  reference  currency  –  the  American 
dollar.  Since  the  prices  of  these  commodities  are  quoted  in  U.S.  dollars,  they  are  tied  up  with  the 
movements of the dollar compared to other currencies, explaining this high correlation between the factor 
and the price of commodities.  

In contrast, factor 2 has a correlation with the price of the commodities that is lower than factor 1. 
Corroborating the idea that factor 2 might represent the impact of the investors’ perception of the risk in 
the  dynamics  of  the  exchange  rate,  this  factor  has  higher  correlation  with  the  VIX  and  the  high  yield 
spread - the variables that are usually adopted by market participants as measures of risk or investors’ risk 
aversion. Finally, consistent with the previous analysis, unlike the other two factors, factor 3 is not highly 
correlated with any variable, and the highest correlations are with the price of gold and with the liquidity 
measure.11  

Table 3 shows the results of a more formal analysis between the relationship between the factors 
and the observable variables. The results of two types of estimations are shown in table 3. In Panel A the 
common factors and the variables are in (log-) differences, yet in panel B we look for the existence of a 
long-run relationship between the factors and our proxies for common shocks; therefore, in this case we 
use  the  variables  in  levels  and  perform  a  dynamic  OLS  estimation  in  order  to  capture  this  relationship. 
Results  in  table  3  confirm  that  there  is  a  relationship  between  the  first  factor  and  the  price  of 
commodities.  For  all of  the specifications there is a significant  relationship  between the  first  factor and 
the CRB Index. It is interesting to note that although the high yield spread and the TED spread play a role 
in  the dynamics of the  factor, almost  all explanatory power of the observable variables comes from  the 
Commodity index.  

Results  in  table  3  indicate  that  factor  2  carries  information  related  to  volatility  and  liquidity 
shocks. In both specifications, the VIX, the high yield spread, the TED spread and the liquidity variable 
present a robust and statistically significant relationship with the factor – although the liquidity shows a 
different sign depending on the specification. When we analyze the separate impact of each variable we 
get that the high yield spread accounts for the bulk of the variability of the factor.  

When  we  observe  the      of  each  specification  we  verify  that  the  variables  used  in  the 
specifications account for a significant proportion of the variability of the factors in the case of factors 1 
and 2, but this is not the case for factor 3. Corroborating previous results, the identification of factor 3 is a 
more  complex  task.  Results  show  that  the  factor  is  correlated  with  the  gold  prices,  the  VIX,  and  the 
proxies  for  liquidity,  but  none  of  the  results  are  robust.  In  addition,  the  specifications  for  the  factor 
present the lowest    among all specifications.  

In summary, the results indicate that the three estimated factors are able to condense information 
embedded in several variables related to different global shocks and which are advocated by the literature 
as  playing  a  role  in  the  dynamics  of  the  exchange  rate  but  that  are  not  direct  observable  by  market 
participants.  Therefore,  the  condition  that  the  information  embedded  in  the  common  movements  of  the 

                                                      
11  One  limitation  for  assigning  the  significance  of  the  factors  using  this  methodology  is  that  one  variable  might  proxy  different  common 
shocks.  Bekaert  et.  al.  (2010)  show,  for  example,  that  the VIX  might  be  decomposed  into two  components:  a  proxy  for  risk  aversion  and 
expected stock market volatility (uncertainty). This is also true for other proxies. Yet, the analysis allows us to establish the usefulness of the 
factor in condensing the information carried by a set of observable variables.

5.  Exchange Rate Predictability and the Common Factors 

In order to test the predictability of exchange rate models the usually literature performs two types 
of tests: in-sample and out-of-sample tests. As discussed in Chen, Rogoff, and Rossi (2010), the two sets 
of tests not rarely produce different results. These results will depend on several aspects like the stability 
of  the  parameters,  sample  size,  among  others.  The  authors  discuss  that  in-sample  exercises  have  the 
advantage of make use of the full sample  size, present higher power if the parameters are constant, and 
are more likely to detect predictability, but these exercises are more prone to overfitting and  sometimes 
fail  to  present  out-of-sample  predictability.  In  opposition,  out-of-sample  exercises  would  be  more 
realistic,  more  robust  to  time  variation  and  misspecification  problems.  Considering  these  facts,  in  this 
section, we perform the two types of exercises with the objective to analyze the usefulness of the common 
factors in explaining the dynamics of the exchange rate.  

 

5.1 In-sample Predictability 
Table 4 shows the result of a set of in-sample tests.12 Results in table 4 indicate that the inclusion 
 
of  the  factors  significantly  improve  the  exchange  rate  model  that  contains  only  macroeconomic 
fundamentals.  The     of  the  model  containing  only  the  macroeconomic  variables  is  4.14%.  This  value 
increases to 40.28% when the three common factors are included in the model. It is worth noting that the 
model containing only the estimated factors explains a greater proportion of the changes in the exchange 
rate  than  the  macro-fundamentals  model.  The      of  the  factor-model  is  36.45%,  which  is  substantially 
higher than the    of the model enclosing only the macro-fundamentals. A similar picture emerges when 

                                                      
12 Initially, we perform exercises similar to those in Fratzscher et. al.(2012).  

 

10 

 
 
we use the adjusted-   as a measure of comparison among the models. The adjusted-   rises from 1.49% 
in the model with only the macro variables to 37.33% when we add the estimated common factors.  
 
Table 4 - In-sample Tests 
Table  4  shows  the  results  of  a  set  of  in-sample  tests.  Results  are  from  the  estimation  of  (1)  including  only  the  estimated  common  factors 
(Only  Factors),  only  the  macroeconomic  fundamentals  (Only  Macro  Fundamentals)  and  with  the  two  set  of  variables  together  (Factors  + 
Macro fundamentals). Log (SSR/T) is the logarithm of the sum of the square of the residuals, AIC is the Akaike  information criteria. HR is 
the  percentage  of  time  that  the  estimated  model  correctly  predicts  the  realized  change  in  the  exchange  rate.  HM  is  the  result  of  the 
Henriksson and Merton (1981) test. *, ** mean, respectively, 1% and 5% level of significance.

The  results  presented  in  table  4  using  the  information  criteria  confirm  that  the  inclusion  of  the 
estimated  common  factors  considerably  improve  the  predictive  power  of  the  model  containing  only  the 
macroeconomic  fundamentals.  Both  –  the  logarithm  of  the  sum  of  the  square  of  the  residuals  and  the 
Akaike  criteria  –  present  better  values  for  the  models  that  include  the  factors  than  for  the  models  that 
comprise only the macro variables.  

Finally, following  Fratzscher  et. al. (2012)  we perform  two different  tests to  analyze the market 
timing  capability  of  the  models.  The  hit  ratio  test  (HR)  show  the  percentage  of  time  that  the  estimated 
model  correctly  predicts  the  realized  change  in  the  exchange  rate.  The  HM  Test  is  a  test  proposed  by 
Henriksson  and  Merton  (1981)  to  test  the  market  timing  ability  of  a  model.  The  test  estimates  the 
correlation between the realized and fitted exchange rate returns. A positive coefficient can be interpreted 
as the market timing ability of the model.  

The results of the market timing ability test shown in table 4 confirm the superior performance of 
the models containing the estimated factors. A model containing only the macroeconomic fundamentals is 
able to correctly predict the exchange rate change in 61.8% of the time of the sample, in contrast adding 
the estimated factors we are able to  predict  correctly in  76.3% of times.  In addition,  the  analysis of the 
coefficients of the HM model also point out the higher predictive power of the models with the factors. 
Besides being positive and statistically significant, indicating the market timing ability of the models, the 
coefficients  in  the  models  with  the  factors  are  higher  compared  to  the  coefficients  in  the  benchmark 
model containing only the macroeconomic fundamentals.   

 
5.1.1 Granger Causality 
 
The view that the exchange rate is determined by the present value of future fundamentals make 
the Granger causality test an useful tool in analyzing the predictive power of the estimated factors. If the 
common global factors have any predictability over the exchange rate movements one should fail to reject 
that the estimated factor granger cause the exchange rate. A relevant point to note is that, as discussed by 
Chen,  Rogoff  and  Rossi  (2010),  Granger-  causality  tests  may  be  problematic  for  macroeconomic 
fundamentals since there might exist a problem of causality between the exchange rate and fundamentals 
and  this  would  undermine  the  test.  This  is  not  the  case  here  since  we  do  not  expect  any  role  for  the 
dynamics of the exchange rate R$ / US$ in the determination of the factors.  

Table 5 confirms these  facts. Considering 10%  as our level  of significance the results in  table 5 
indicate that the hypothesis that the factors do not granger cause the exchange rate is rejected for all three 
factors. In addition, the results show that the hypothesis that the exchange rate does not Granger cause the 

11 

 

 
 
factor  is  not  rejected  for  all  three  factors.  These  results  confirm  the  in-sample  predictive  power  of  the 
common global factors.  

 

Table 5 – Granger Causality and Stability Tests 
Table 5 show the results (p-value) of the Granger causality tests between the estimated factors and the exchange rate R$ / US$ in the period 
between  January  1999  and  August  2011.  The  test  is  performed  using  heteroskedasticity  and  autocorrelation  robust  variance  estimation 
(Newey and West, 1987). Table 5 also reports the p-values for the Andrews stability test.

Several  authors  (Chen,  Rogoff,  Rossi  (2010),  Rossi  (2006,  2012)  among  others)  argue  that  the 
difficulty in modeling the dynamics of the relationship between the exchange rate and the macroeconomic 
fundamentals  is  that for  different  reasons  this relationship is  unstable over time.  Rossi (2005) discusses 
that conventional Granger causality test fail in the presence of these instabilities. In order to analyze this 
problem,  table  5  also  reports  results  from  Quandt  Likelihood  Ratio  (QLR)  instability  tests  (Andrews, 
1993) for the Granger-causality relationship between the factors and the exchange rate. Results indicate 
that  for  any  of  the  relationship  analyzed  the  tests  reject  the  presence  of  instabilities,  strengthening  the 
results from the Granger causality tests.   

In summary, all in-sample exercises indicate that the inclusion of the estimated common factors 
improves the predictive power of the traditional macroeconomic models and that, unlike the relationship 
between the exchange rate and the macroeconomic fundamentals, the role of the common factors in the 
exchange  rate  dynamics  seem  to  be  more  stable.  Next  section  analyzes  whether  this  in-sample 
improvement is also translated in a better out-of-sample predictability.  

 

5.2 Out-of-sample Predictability 

We  follow  Ferraro,  Rogoff  and  Rossi  (2012)  and  perform  a  rolling  windows  “out-of-sample” 
forecasting  exercise  using  equation  (1).  Chen,  Rogoff  and  Rossi  (2010)  argue  that  the  rolling  window 
scheme is more robust with respect to a possible time-variation of the parameters because it adapts more 
quickly  to  possible  structural  changes  compared  to  a  recursive  scheme.  Yet,  we  include  the  use  of 
different methodologies, like the recursive scheme, as robustness exercises. The out-of-sample forecast is 
done for four different forecast horizons (h=1, 3, 6 and 12 months ahead).  

The process of out-of-sample forecasting is executed according to the following steps for a sample 
size T=152 months. Starting in January 1999, for a given window size (N) and a forecast horizon (h), the 
factors  are  estimated  from  the  series  of  the  exchange  rate  of  the  18  countries,  using  the  maximum 
likelihood method, as follows: 
                                                                              

                                                                        (2) 
In  the  second  step,  equation  (1)  is  estimated  using  the  factors  estimated  in  the  first  step  and/or 
macroeconomic fundamentals using only data until time t. Given the estimation of (1), a h-period ahead 
forecast is performed. The process is done for all forecast horizons h=1,3,6 and 12 months ahead.  Then 
we advance one-period and the forecasting is performed again. We continue until the end of the sample.  
Here a very important remark has to be made. The forecast exercise performed is not a real “out-
of-sample”  forecast  exercise.  Note  that  according  to  (2),  data  until  t+h  is  used  in  order  to  estimate  the 
factors;  therefore,  in  the  forecasting  process,  realized  value  for  the  factors  and  the  macroeconomic 
fundamentals are used. West (1996) points out that this type of exercise is useful for the evaluation of the 

12 

 

 

 
 
predictability of a model given the path of the variables. Ferraro, Rogoff and Rossi (2012) argue that if 
the goal of the exercise is to demonstrate the usefulness of the addition of a fundamental – in our case, the 
common factors  – this forecasting strategy would be more appropriate.  In their case, they advocate this 
strategy  given  the  difficult  in  forecasting  oil  prices  –  their  additional  fundamental.  They  discuss  that  if 
past values of oil prices are not good predictors of future oil prices one might reject the predictability of 
the model due to poor forecast process that past oil prices give for future oil prices and not because the 
lack of relationship between the exchange rate and the additional fundamental. It is clear that in our case 
this problem is even more pronounced given that we do not have any formal model to forecast the factors. 
Given these facts, we use the rolling “out-of-sample” forecast exercise as our baseline strategy and leave 
the other strategies to be analyzed in the robustness exercises. The out-of-sample forecasting (described 
above) is then compared with a forecast model that assumes that the exchange rate follows a random walk 
with and without a drift. 

We  use  the  Theil’s  U  statistic  as  the  criterion  for  judging  the  performance  of  each  model.  The 
statistic  is  calculated  as  ratio  between  the  mean  square  prediction  error  (MSPE)  of  each  model  and  the 
mean  square  prediction  error  of  the  two  different  benchmark  models:  random  walk  with  and  without  a 
drift. Values lower than 1 indicate that the model possesses a smaller MSPE than the random walk model. 
However, even a value higher than 1 can be considered evidence of a superior performance of the model 
compared to the random walk. As argued in Clark and West (2006, 2007), if the  process generating the 
exchange  rate  is,  in  fact,  a  random  walk,  the  inclusion  of  other  variables  should  introduce  noise  in  the 
forecasting process, leading, on average, to a greater mean square prediction error than the random walk 
(and  thus  producing  statistics  with  a  value  greater  than  1).  We  use  then  the  Clark  and  West  (2006) 
statistic  as  the  evaluation  criteria  for  forecast  quality.  The  Clark  and  West  statistic  (2006)  is  more 
appropriate  for  asymptotic  tests  than  the  one  given  by  Diebold  and  Mariano  (1995)  and  West  (1996) 
(DMW) for nested models. As observed by Clark and West (2006), in nested models, the DMW statistics 
yields a test statistic with a non-normal distribution, which underestimates the quantity of null hypothesis 
rejections.  

 
5.2.1 Baseline Results 
Table  6  confirms  the  usefulness  of  the  estimated  common  factors  in  improving  the  predictive 
power  of  the  models  containing  only  macroeconomic  fundamentals.  When  we  analyze  the  predictive 
power of the models containing only the macroeconomic variables we verify the conventional instability 
found by the literature. Although the model is able to beat the random walk in several occasions, it does 
not do this in a robust manner. In all specifications, for example, the model is not able to beat for short-
horizon  forecasts  (1-month  ahead).  The  model  containing  only  macroeconomic  fundamentals  seems  to 
have  more  predictive  power  for  medium  and  long-horizon  forecasts,  although  even  for  these  forecast 
horizons the model is not able to beat the random walk benchmark in different opportunities.  

The  results  reported  in  table  6  show  that  once  we  use  a  model  containing  the  macroeconomic 
fundamentals together with the estimated common factors not only the model is able to beat the random 
walk  in  short-horizons  forecasts  but  also  there  is  a  significant  reduction  in  the  mean  square  prediction 
error  of  the  model,  confirming  that  the  common  factors  carry  useful  information  for  forecasting  the 
exchange  rate.  In  fact,  in  almost  all  forecast  horizons  and  sample  size  a  model  containing  the 
macroeconomic  fundamentals  together  with  the  estimated  factors  is  able  to  beat  the  two  benchmark 
models.  

The usefulness of the estimated factors for short-term predictions is evident when we analyze the 
model  containing  only  these  fundamentals.  The  model  containing  only  the  factors  presents  the  lowest 
mean square error predictions for all specifications. It is interesting to note that the model containing only 
the factors is also able to beat the benchmark models in almost all specifications, assuring the importance 
of these factors in the dynamics of the exchange rate.

5.2.2 Alternative Specifications 
Results  found  in  table  6  might  be  the  result  of  the  specification  adopted.  In  order  to  verify  the 

 
strength of the results we perform several robustness exercises.  
 
 
5.2.2.1 Recursive (Sequential) Strategy 
 
In this exercise we follow procedures similar  to the baseline framework but now instead of roll 
the estimation window we add one observation one by one until the end of the sample, each observation 
is  included  in  the  sample  such  that  the  sample  available  for  regression  estimation  and  the  factors 
increases. In this case, we start with a sample size of 1/5 of the full sample. The results in table 7 confirm 
our previous findings with respect to the usefulness of the common factor in predicting the exchange rate. 
The results in table 7 indicates that the use of both fundamentals – common factors and macroeconomic – 

 

14 

 
 
lead to better results. Although all models are able to beat the benchmark models, the combination of the 
models gives the best result with lower mean square prediction errors for all forecast horizons.

5.2.2.1 Lagged 
The  rolling  “out-of-sample”  strategy  adopted  is  not  a  truly  out-of-sample  exercise  since  it  uses 
 
realized  fundamentals.  This  strategy  is  of  limited  use  to  professional  forecasters  since  it  makes  use  of 
information not available to the forecaster. Now, we consider the following change in equation (1) for any 
forecast horizon h:  
                                                                                                                                                 (3) 
         Observe that now only the lagged value of  the estimated common factors and the macroeconomic 
fundamentals  are  used  in  order  to  forecast  the  exchange  rate.  Following  this  procedure,  the  forecast 
process  is  performed using only information  available at  time t. The other procedures are similar  to the 
exercise done for the baseline framework. The results for a sample size N= ½ of total sample is shown in 
table 8.13

The results in table 8 confirm the robustness of the previous analysis. Both - the model containing 
the factors and the macroeconomic variables - are able to beat the two benchmark specifications with the 
model  using  only  the  macroeconomic  fundamentals  demonstrating  more  difficulty  to  beat  the 
benchmarks,  especially  for  short  forecast  horizon.  This  problem  seems  to  be  solved  once  we  add  the

estimated  factors.  The  model  containing  the  macroeconomic  fundamentals  and  the  estimated  factors 
together  is  able  to  beat  the  random  walk  benchmarks  for  any  forecast  horizon  assuring  that  the  factors 
carry useful information for forecasting the exchange rate.  

 

 

6. Conclusions 

This  paper  studies  the  usefulness  of  the  use  of  factors  embedded  in  the  common  movements  of 
exchange rates in  forecasting the exchange rate  of the Brazilian Real / US Dollar from January 1999 to 
August 2011. 

The results confirm  that  the inclusion of the common  factor improves the in-sample and out-of-
sample  predictability  of  the  traditional  models  for  the  determination  of  the  exchange  rate  that  includes 
only macroeconomic fundamentals.    

In  the  case  of  the  out-of-sample  exercise,  the  paper  shows  that  independently  of  the  forecast 
horizon  or  window  of  estimation  a  model  including  the  estimated  common  factors  and  the 
macroeconomic  fundamentals  are  able  to  beat  any  of  the  benchmark  models  considered  -  the  random 
walk  with  or  without  a  drift.  The  results  are  even  more  pronounced  for  short  term  predictions  –  a 
recurrent failure of the traditional models.  

The paper also tries to link to the factors with observable variables usually considered by market 
participants and the literature as proxies for common global shocks. The results indicate that the estimated 
factors condense the information contained in a set of variables. The estimated factors carry information 
on the demand for dollars – a dollar effect, global volatility and liquidity shocks.  

In summary, the results of the paper note that the use of factors is useful to forecast the exchange 
rate. There are periods when the unobservable variables captured by the estimation of the factors from the 
common dynamics of exchange rates are crucial for forecasting the exchange rate.
