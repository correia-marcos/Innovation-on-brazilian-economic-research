Este trabalho estima os impactos da OMC sobres os fluxos de comércio desagregados estimando o modelo gravitacional 
por meio do estimador de Pseudo Máxima Verossimilhança de Poisson e efeitos fixos. A amostra inclui importações 
bilaterais de 133 países nos setores primário, têxtil e manufatureiro para o período 1995-2014. As estimativas sugerem 
que a OMC conseguiu expandir o comércio internacional, o que difere de alguns resultados da literatura anterior. No 
entanto,  esse  crescimento  ocorreu  de  maneira  assimétrica  entre  os  países  desenvolvidos  e  em  desenvolvimento, 
membros  e  não  membros.  No  período  em  análise,  os  países  desenvolvidos  foram  os  que  mais  se  beneficiaram  do 
aumento do comércio mundial promovido pela OMC, semelhante aos resultados da literatura existente para o período 
1950-2000. Embora os países desenvolvidos também tenham tido seus fluxos de comércio expandidos pela OMC nos 
setores têxtil e industrial, o maior crescimento ocorreu no setor primário, o que diverge de estudos anteriores. Da mesma 
forma,  a  abertura  multilateral  dos  países  em  desenvolvimento  impulsionou  o  crescimento  do  comércio  apenas  em 
produtos primários e industriais, mas em menor escala do que os países desenvolvidos. Finalmente, a significância 
estatística dos coeficientes estimados é sensível à estrutura do cluster utilizada.

ABSTRACT 

 
This paper provides new evidences on the impact of the WTO on disaggregated trade flows using a gravity model 
estimated  by  the  Pseudo  Maximum  Likelihood  of  Poisson  (PPML)  estimator  and  fixed  effects.  The  sample 
includes bilateral imports from 133 countries in the primary, textile and manufacturing sectors for the period 1995-
2014. Results suggest that the WTO has succeeded in expanding international trade, which differs from the results of 
the previous literature. However, this growth occurred asymmetrically between the developed and developing countries, 
members and non-members. In the period under review, developed countries benefited most from the increase in world 
trade  promoted  by  the  WTO,  similar  to  the  findings  of  the  extant  literature  for  the  period  1950-2000.  Although 
developed nations also had their trade flows expanded by the WTO in the textile and industrial sectors, the largest 
growth occurred in the primary sector, which is at odds with the literature. Similarly, the multilateral liberalization of 
developing  countries  has  boosted  trade  growth  only  in  primary  and  industrial  products,  but  to  a  lesser  extent  than 
developed nations. Finally, the statistical significance of the estimated coefficients is sensitive to the cluster structure 
used.

Introduction 

 
1. 
 
The world trade system that emerged after World War II was regulated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) that was signed by 23 nations in 1947 and entered into effect in 1948. This agreement fostered 
several negotiation rounds that aimed to reduce trade barriers among GATT-member nations. The last completed 
round of negotiations was the Uruguay Round in 1994. Chief among its outcomes was the creation of the World 
Trade Organization (WTO). Since its foundation in 1995, the WTO brought changes to the world trade system, 
and  at  the  same  time,  several  countries  have  applied  to  become  members.  Currently,  the  WTO  has  over  164 
members who account for 98 percent of world trade4, and there are 20 countries interested in becoming members 
(WTO, 2019). 
 
Such an interest in the WTO membership prompts the question of whether this membership promotes 
trade or not. The seminal work empirical of Rose (2004) utilized the gravity equation to estimate how much more 
GATT/WTO  members  traded  relative  to  non-members.  His  results  indicated  that  the  GATT/WTO  had  not 
promoted trade among its members. This counter-intuitive result to many observers sparked an intense debate 
about the impact of these institutions on trade. Several studies also based upon the gravity equation contested 
Rose's results on the grounds of sample selection, econometric misspecification, and measurement error.  
 
Roy  (2011)  also  reached  the  same  result  and  argued  that  the  impact  of  the  WTO  on  trade  remains 
undefined, partly because of the failure of previous studies to address three aspects simultaneously: the inclusion 
of zero trade flows in the sample, to adequately control multilateral resistance and to appropriately define the 
members of the institution. Eicher and Henn (2011) also found no positive effects on world trade that could be 
attributed  to  these  institutions  even  after  correcting  the  omitted  variable  bias  on  two  fronts:  by  including 
individual  effects  for  the  Preferred  Trade  Agreements  (PTAs)  and  by  multilateral  resistance  controls  and 
unobserved  bilateral  heterogeneity.  On  the other  hand,  several  authors  have estimated  a positive effect of  the 
WTO on trade flows—see Tomz et al (2007), Subramanian and Wei (2007), Chang and Lee (2011) and Dutt et 
al (2013). To this date, the evidence on the effects of the WTO remains mixed. 
 
The  effect  of  WTO  in  international  trade  is  crucial  in  a  moment  that  multilateral  negotiations  (Doha 
Round) are paralyzed. And at the same time, countries are engaging in regional trade agreement negotiations, 
which may or may not be stumbling blocks towards multilateral liberalization. In this way, this paper contributes 
to the literature by providing new estimates of the effects of the WTO membership on trade flows specifically 
for the period between 1995 and 2014. To do so, we employ a gravity equation model that incorporates the most 
recent methodological and econometric advances by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006), Roy (2011), Eicher and 
Henn (2011) and Larch et al (2017). These innovations consist of using PPML estimator with fixed effects, zero 
trade observations, disaggregated trade flows at the product level, and multi-level standard error clustering.  
Our  results  indicate  that  the  WTO  had  no  impact  on  total  trade,  for  both  developed  and  developing 
 
countries, confirming the estimates by Rose (2004) and Roy (2011), but in a more recent period (1995-2014). 
However,  by  analyzing  sectoral  trade  flows,  we  find  that  the  impacts  of  the  WTO  on  trade  are  asymmetric 
between  the  developed  and  developing  countries,  members  and  non-members.  In  fact,  they  are  positive  and 
significant for trade in primary and textiles products, strongly differing from the estimates of Subramanian and 
Wei (2007). Thus, it shows the importance of using disaggregated trade data to make inferences about the impact 
of Regional and Multilateral liberalization on trade. 

The remainder of this paper was organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical evidence of the 
effects of the WTO on trade. Section 3 presents the gravitational model. Section 4 describes the data, as well as 
the econometric methodology employed in this paper. Section 5 presents and discusses the results and section 6 
concludes. 
 
2.  Empirical Evidence of the WTO impacts on the international trade flows 

 

The first study to investigate the effects of GATT/WTO membership on trade volume was Rose (2004). He used 
panel and cross-sectional data and estimated the gravity equation using ordinary least squares (OLS) and fixed 
effects (FE) estimators. The fixed effects where at the country and year levels. The period analyzed was from 

                                                        
4 In 1995, WTO members accounted for 88 per cent of world merchandise trade.

1950  to  1998  and  the  sample  included  175  countries.  Surprisingly,  Rose  (2004)  found  that  the  GATT/WTO 
membership had no effect on the increase in total trade volume among countries, where total trade flow means 
trade volume across all goods. Subsequently, reviewing his own article, Rose (2005) did find a positive impact 
of  GATT/WTO  membership  on  trade  volume  in  empirical  specifications  that  controlled  for  membership  in 
Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs). 

This  result  from  Rose  (2004)  was  deemed  counter-intuitive  by  many  observers.  Accordingly,  several 
researchers have been further scrutinizing it. Tomz et al (2007) highlighted that the GATT/WTO membership 
definition used by Rose (2004) was a de jure and not a de facto definition. This distinction is important because 
several former colonies enjoyed the GATT/WTO membership of their former colonizers. Once using a de facto 
measure of GATT/WTO membership, Tomz et al (2007) did find a positive effect of GATT/WTO membership 
on  total  trade  flows  using  both  a  similar  econometric  approach  to  that  employed  by  Rose  (2004)  and  a 
specification using country-pair fixed effects.  

Subramanian  and  Wei  (2007)  took  a  different  route  and  focused  on  whether  GATT/WTO  membership 
effects were heterogeneous across types of goods and countries. These effects are likely to be different across 
types of goods because non-manufacturing and textiles goods were not part of the GATT liberalization process. 
The rationale for the second type of heterogeneity is that industrial countries would have benefited more because 
they participated more actively than the developing countries in the reciprocal trade negotiations. Also, bilateral 
trade was greater when both partners committed to liberalization when compared to a situation where only one 
partner  effectively  liberalized  its  economy.  The  dataset  used  by  Subramanian  and  Wei  (2007)  excluded 
observations with import values of less than US$ 500,000. Their findings contradicted the results of Rose (2004) 
by providing evidence that the WTO generated an additional impact of about 120 percent in world trade in the 
year 2000, for instance. 

The ensuing literature has continued to scrutinize these results. Many researchers decompose the changes 
in trade volume into two margins of adjustment. The first is the extensive margin, in which a country or does not 
trade  with  another  country.  Given  that  a  pair  of  countries  is  trading  a  positive  volume  with  each  other,  the 
intensive margin is the change in this volume of trade. Liu (2009) suggests that the GATT/WTO has not only 
fostered trade among members that already traded with each other (intensive margin), but also created new trade 
relationships among its members (extensive margin). Liu (2009) also points out that most of the literature studies 
that  exclude  zero  trade  observations  simply  ignore  the  extensive  margin.  Hence,  the  estimates  effects  of  the 
GATT/WTO membership will be biased. He further argues that because of the violation of some assumptions, 
traditional  log-linear  regressions  of  gravity  cannot  uncover  the  role  of  the  GATT/WTO  even  at  the  intensive 
margin. Liu (2009) estimated the gravitational model using three estimators: OLS (using a specification with a 
logarithmic transformation in the dependent variable and another considering only positive trade flows), Tobit, 
and the Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML). The last two estimators in different ways account for the 
zero trade flows. The sample used encompasses 210 countries over the years 1948-2003. His results imply that 
GATT/WTO members traded 60 percent more on average than non-members.  

Roy (2011) makes the point that  the previous studies  failed  to address several econometric issues. Roy 
(2011)  address  these  issues  by  including  zero-trade  observations  in  the  sample,  controlling  for  multilateral 
resistance  terms,  and  using  an  appropriate definition  of  GATT/WTO  membership.  Roy  (2011)  employed  Liu 
(2009)'s data from 1950 to 2000, and included zero trade flows. Differently from previous studies that employed 
annual data, Roy (2011) used five-year interval data. Another difference is the use of two transformations of the 
dependent variable to address the zero trade flows. Let  𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑡 be the imports of country i from country j, at time t. 
The first transformed dependent variable is (1 + 𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑡) and the second is (𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑡 + √𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑡
). Roy (2011) estimates 
provide evidence that the GATT/WTO membership did not promote trade.

Eicher  and  Henn  (2011)  employed  data  from  Subramanian  and  Wei  (2007)  and  used  the  econometric 
specifications of Rose (2004) and Tomz et al (2007). They found that the GATT/WTO effects on trade flows are 
not statistically significant, whereas RTA membership had a strong but uneven effect on the trade. Additionally, 
by modifying the econometric model to estimate the possible channels in which the WTO may have affected 
trade flows, the estimates suggest that accession to the GATT/WTO membership increased trade not only prior 
to the formation of RTAs, but also trade among the geographically closest developing countries at the expense 
of trade with more distant countries. In addition, they showed that the countries with the greatest incentives to 

 

 

4 

 
negotiate  tariff  reductions  during  the  WTO  accession  negotiations  are  those  that  experienced  positive  and 
significant trade effects of GATT/WTO membership on their trade flows. 

Dutt et al (2013) employed 6-digit HS bilateral trade data for 190 exporters and 168 importers in the period 
1988-2006 to further examine the roles of the intensive and extensive margin using the two-part econometric 
model proposed by Helpman et al (2008). Their findings indicate that the impact of GATT/WTO membership 
takes place almost exclusively on the extensive margin of trade. More precisely, WTO accession is estimated to 
increase the extensive margin of exports by 25 percent, while at the same time, GATT/WTO membership has a 
negative impact on the intensive margin. 

There are also two other papers that employed alternative econometric methodologies relative to that of 
the previously mentioned studies. Chang and Lee (2011) used non-parametric methods, including pair-matching, 
permutation  tests,  and  a  sensitivity  analysis  to  assess  the  way  the  GATT/WTO  affected  trade  flows.  These 
methods  allow  for  general  forms  of  heterogeneous  effects  and  their  results  suggest  that  the  GATT/WTO  has 
significantly  expanded  world  trade  and  its  estimates  are  robust  to  a  number  of  restricted  matching  criteria, 
alternative  GATT/WTO  membership  definitions,  the  non-random  incidence  of  positive  trade  flows  and  the 
inclusion of multilateral terms of resistance. Figueiredo et al (2014) employed a censored quantile regression and 
a sample encompassing 194 countries over the years 1949-2006. The effects of the WTO are positive at the lower 
quartiles, positive at the median and negative at the upper quantiles. Moreover, WTO membership expands the 
mean trade flows by 9 percent and the median flow by approximately 6.3 percent. This, this means that WTO 
membership shift the trade flow distribution to increase trade. 

Table 1 provides a summary of existing estimates of the effects of the WTO on trade. The database used 
in this article covers the period from 1995 to 2014 and is more recent than those used in previous studies. Thus, 
it comprises only the WTO period, therefore it cannot be used to measure the effects of the GATT on trade.

3.  The Gravity Model 
 
The gravity equation has been the workhorse of empirical trade economists interested in estimating the effects of 
multilateral  and  regional  trade  agreements  (Limão,  2016).  The  idea  behind  the  gravity  equation  -  shown  in 
Equation  (1) -  is  that  the imports  (𝑚𝑖𝑗)  of  country  i  from  country  j  is  directly  proportional  to  the size  of  their 
economies (𝑌𝑖 and 𝑌𝑗) and inversely proportional to the transportation cost (𝜏𝑖𝑗) between them, usually proxied by 
physical distance.

This model is typically estimated by regressing the log of imports on variables like exporter's and importer's 
GDP and log of distance between them. In the mid-1990s, estimates using this specification have come under 
fire due to its sensitivity to the sample of countries included in the analysis (Haveman and Hummels, 1998) and 
to  the  variables  included  in  the  estimated  specification  (Ghosh  and  Yamarik,  2004).  In  fact,  Wei  (1996), 
Deardorff (1998) and Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) argued that this traditional gravitational model may 
present specification problems by ignoring multilateral resistance to trade and remoteness of countries.  

Anderson  and  van  Wincoop  (2003)  were  the  first  to  provide  a  theoretical  framework  for  the  gravity 
equation that precisely depicted the role of multilateral resistance terms and showed that their omission from the 
estimated model leads to inconsistent estimates. Most important, these multilateral resistance terms are country 
specific and change over time. Without loss of generality, let's focus on a simplified version of the theoretical 
model proposed by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003): 

 

𝑚𝑖𝑗 =

𝑌𝑖𝑌𝑗
𝑌𝑤

(

𝜏𝑖𝑗
𝑃𝑖𝑃𝑗

)

(1−𝜎)

𝜀𝑖𝑗 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) 

where 𝑌𝑤 is the world GDP, (1 − 𝜎) is the elasticity of substitution, 𝑃𝑗 is external multilateral resistance, which 
captures the fact that exports from country to country i depend on trade costs in all possible export markets, and 
finally, 𝑃𝑖  is the internal multilateral resistance that captures the dependence of the country j of imports from 
country i on the commercial costs of all possible suppliers in the world. Taking the logarithm of Equation (2), 
we obtain a log-linearized version of the gravitational model as demonstrated by Equation (3).  
 

log 𝑚𝑖𝑗 = log 𝑌𝑖 + log 𝑌𝑗 − log 𝑌𝑤 + (1 − 𝜎)[log 𝜏𝑖𝑗 − log 𝑃𝑖 − log 𝑃𝑗] + log 𝜀𝑖𝑗 
 
Feenstra (2003) suggested the use of exporter and importer countries to address the effects of remoteness 
and isolation. These effects in panel data change over time (Baldwin and Taglioni, 2006; Magee, 2008). In this 
case, the importer-year (αit) and exporter-year (αjt) fixed effects will account for the control multilateral resistance 
and  the  isolation  of  countries  terms.  In  addition,  Magee  (2008)  argues  that  annual  fixed  effects  for  each 
importing and exporting country also control the effects of changes in GDP, per capita income, population, 
and other variables usually included in the gravitational model. This econometric specification is depicted by 
Equation (4).

log 𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼𝑗𝑡 + 𝒙𝑖𝑗𝑡𝜷 + log 𝜀𝑖𝑗

where  𝛼0  is  the  common  intercept  to  all  years  and  country  pairs  (ijt),  𝒙𝑖𝑗𝑡  is  a  1×K  vector  of  the  explanatory 
variables of the model including those that will capture the effects of WTO membership on trade flows, and 𝜷 is 
a  K×1  vector  of  parameters  of  the  variables  to  be  estimated.  In  this  case,  the  WTO  indicator  variables  are 
identified by the within and between variation of country-pair imports over time. This means that these indicators 
will capture the average effects of WTO membership on the countries that were already members in 1995 and 
those experienced by countries that joined the WTO later. 

This study follows Eicher and Henn's (2011) methodology to assess the effects of WTO membership on 
trade  flows.  The  variables  that  capture  the  effects  of  the  WTO  membership  are  constructed  according  to 
Subramanian and Wei (2007), as also used by Eicher and Henn (2011). Subramanian and Wei (2007) created a 
single dummy variable to represent the preferential trade arrangements, separating its trade impacts from WTO 
membership.5 Eicher and Henn (2011) stressed the need to account for the heterogeneous effects of RTAs, since 
many WTO members are also part of RTAs. To address this confounding effect, we control for the world's 24 
most  important  RTAs.  It  should  be noted  that  this  number  is  well  above  the  number  of  RTAs  considered  by 
Eicher and Henn (2011), which attenuates the omitted variable bias.6  

                                                        
5 The variable rta_wto is a dummy that assumes the value of one if importer i is a member of an RTA and the WTO, but the exporter 
is a member of the WTO and non-member of this RTA, and zero otherwise. The variable rta_nwto is a dummy that taking the value of 
one if the importer i is a member of an RTA and the WTO, but the exporter is not member of the agreement and is non-member of the 
WTO, and zero otherwise.

Egger (2005) pointed out a relevant specification issue of Equation (4): the bilateral heterogeneity of the 
exporter  and  the  importer.  These  country-pair  characteristics  -  like  similar  legal  system  -  are  likely  to  affect 
bilateral trade flows and to bias estimates if left unaccounted. This issue can be addressed with the inclusion of 
country-pair  fixed  effects  (𝛼𝑖𝑗)  in  Equation  (4).  According  to  Magee  (2008),  the fixed  effect  (𝛼𝑖𝑗)  controls  all 
observed and unobserved characteristics that are constant over time and influence trade flows. In this sense, this 
approach considers the possibility of natural trading partners, cultural and institutional aspects, as well as all other 
characteristics that are also not measurable that affect trade flows. In other words, these effects will absorb the 
effects  of  time-invariant  country-pair  variables  like  distance  between  countries  adjacency,  common  currency, 
and common language indicators for instance.7  

The inclusion of country-pair fixed effects into Equation (4) changes the interpretation of the estimated 
coefficients of the WTO variables. Now, these coefficients are identified only by the within country-pair variation 
over time. As a result, these estimated coefficients reflect the average effect of WTO membership enjoyed by the 
new members only. Moreover, the effects of WTO membership on countries that were already members at the 
start year of our sample will be absorbed by the country-pair effects. In light of these remarks, we will estimate 
specifications with and without country-pair effects. 

On the other hand, there are two fundamental econometric issues with the log-linear specification like that 
in Equation (4). First, log-linearized models cannot deal with zero trade observations, since the natural logarithm 
of zero is not defined. These observations are usually dropped, or a transformation is applied to the dependent 
variable to make it positive. The most usual transformation adopted by the literature is to add one to all values of 
the dependent variable (1 + mijt), to take the logarithm of the data, as Eichengreen and Irwin (1995) suggested.  
The second issue is the presence of heteroskedasticity since the expected value of the logarithm of the error 
(log εij) depends on the higher moments of εij, including its variance. As Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) point 
out, it is very likely that a model with bilateral trade flows has a heteroskedastic error term. This means that the 
regressors will be correlated with the error term, and this renders the estimates biased and inconsistent. Note that 
this type of heteroskedasticity cannot be addressed simply by using a robust covariance matrix estimator because 
this  form  of  heteroskedasticity  biases  the  estimates  of  both  coefficients  and  standard  errors.  Therefore,  the 
presence of heteroskedasticity under the assumption of a multiplicative error term in the theoretical specification 
of the nonlinear gravitational model requires a completely different estimation methodology from the one that 
was being used by the traditional approach. 

Santos  Silva  and  Tenreyro  (2006)  proposed  estimating  the  gravity  model  using  the  Poisson  Pseudo 
Maximum  Likelihood  estimator  because  as  long  as  the  gravitational  model  is  correctly  specified,  the  PPML 
estimator will provide consistent parameter estimates even with heteroskedastic errors also provides a natural 
way to deal with zero values of the dependent  variable. To compare the PPML performance relative to other 
estimators, Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) conducted several Monte Carlo simulations for the gravitational 
model estimated using the following estimators: OLS, Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS), Tobit, and PPML. They 
found that the PPML performance was considerably better and they considered it to be the most reliable. These 
results  were  corroborated  by  Magee  (2008),  Siliverstovs  and  Schumacher  (2009),  and  Westerlund  and 
Wilhelmsson (2009). 

Nevertheless, the interpretation of the coefficients estimated by the PPML is direct and follows exactly the 
same  pattern  of  the  OLS  estimator.8  Moreover,  according  to  Santos  Silva  and  Tenreyro  (2015),  the  HMR 
estimator is valid only under strong assumptions regarding the distribution assumed by Helpman et al (2008).

7 Furthermore, Glick and Rose (2001) suggested the constraint that the country-pair fixed effects to be symmetric, that is,  𝛼𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼𝑗𝑖 in 
order to reduce the number of estimated parameters. 
8 Although the dependent variable is specified in level, the coefficients of any independent variables, inserted in logarithm, can still be 
interpreted as semi-elasticities.

Specifically, the HMR estimator will only be valid if all the random components of the model are homoskedastic. 
However, Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2015) did statistical tests using the sample of Helpman et al (2008) and 
clearly  rejected  such  assumptions  and,  furthermore,  the  authors  performed  numerical  experiments  which 
indicated that the HMR estimator is very sensitive to deviations from the homoscedasticity assumption. Thus, 
Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2015) posed doubts about any inference made, based on the empirical implementation 
of the HMR model. 

An additional advantage of the PPML estimator is that it does not suffer from the incidental parameters 
problem (see Fernández-Val and Weidner, 2016), which is an important concern whenever fixed effects are used. 
In other words, the PPML allows for “differencing out” of the fixed effects, and this improves the computational 
speed and accuracy. A shortcoming of the PPML estimator is that its numerical implementation does not converge 
sometimes.  This  problem  also  affects  several  non-linear  estimators  and  can  be  attenuated  by  re-scaling  and 
centering variables. Since it is not clear whether the assumption about the conditional variance actually hold, to 
account  fully  heteroskedasticity  it  is  recommended  to  make  inferences  based  on  the  Eicker-White  robust 
covariance matrix estimator. Because of all these arguments, we chose the PPML estimator. 

 

4.  Data and Empirical Methods 

 
Our sample covers 133 countries for a period of 20 years from 1995 to 2014.9 These nations represented, 
in terms of global trade, approximately 99% of total world imports for the period under review. Thus, this study 
contains  17,556  annual  observations  (133  importing  countries  ×  132  bilateral  import  flows)  and  351,120 
observations for the whole period (17,556 pairs × 20 years). Dependent variables10, imports of primary products, 
textiles, industrialized and total import, in millions of current US dollars, were obtained from UNCTADstat. The 
distance in kilometers was obtained from the CEPII11, as well as the dummies of frontier, language and colonial 
relations. The dummies for the RTAs and the WTO were built by the authors themselves, based on  the WTO 
official data (WTO, 2019). 

In this paper, the gravitational model was specificity in four different ways. The first specification labeled 

PPML-Pair incorporates the fixed effects for each pair of countries. This model can be represented as follows: 

 

 

where: 
 

 

𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑡 = exp[𝛼𝑖𝑗 + 𝒙𝑖𝑗𝑡𝜷] × 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 

𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑡 is the scalar of imports from country i from exporter j at time t; 
𝒙𝑖𝑗𝑡 is a vector line 1×K of the k variables explanatory of the model; 
𝜷 is a vector K×1 of the parameters to be estimated; 
𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 is the scalar of idiosyncratic error. 

The second specification controls the multilateral resistance by including fixed effects for importers and 

exporters. This model labeled PPML-MLR can be represented as follows: 

 

                                                        
9  The  sample  includes  the  following  countries:  Algeria,  Angola,  Argentina,  Australia,  Austria,  Azerbaijan,  Bahrain,  Bangladesh, 
Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cape Verde, Canada, Chile , 
China,  Colombia,  Comoros,  Congo,  Costa  Rica,  Côte  d'Ivoire,  Croatia,  Cuba,  Czech  Republic,  Denmark,  Djibouti ,  Dominican

Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zaire, 
Zambia and Zimbabwe. 
10 For primary products, SITC classification was considered as 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 68 and, for the textile sector, textile, yarn, fabric and 
clothing fibers classified as SITC 26 + 65 + 84.

where: 
 

𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑡 = exp[𝛼0 + 𝛼𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼𝑗𝑡 + 𝒙𝑖𝑗𝑡𝜷] × 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 

8 

𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑡 is the scalar of imports from country i from exporter j at time t; 
𝛼0 is the scalar of the constant; 
𝛼𝑖𝑡 is the scalar of the fixed effect of importer i at time t; 
𝛼𝑗𝑡 is the scalar of the fixed effect of the exporter j at time t; 
𝒙𝑖𝑗𝑡 is a vector line 1×K of the k variables explanatory of the model; 
𝜷 is a vector K×1 of the parameters to be estimated; 
𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 is the scalar of idiosyncratic error. 

 
The third specification address multilateral resistance terms and the fixed effect for each pair of countries. 
This  specification  labeled  PPML-MLR-Pair  has  theoretical  support,  as  demonstrated  by  Anderson  and  van 
Wincoop (2003) and Baldwin and Taglioni (2006). Formally, this equation, that represent the structural gravity 
model, can be represented as follows: 

 

 
where: 
 

𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑡 = exp[𝛼𝑖𝑗 + 𝛼𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼𝑗𝑡 + 𝒙𝑖𝑗𝑡𝜷] × 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 

𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑡 is the scalar of imports from country i from exporter j at time t; 
𝛼𝑖𝑗 is the scalar of the fixed effect in time for each pair of countries ij; 
𝛼𝑖𝑡 is the scalar of the fixed effect of importer i at time t; 
𝛼𝑗𝑡 is the scalar of the fixed effect of the exporter j at time t; 
𝒙𝑖𝑗𝑡 is a vector line 1×K of the k variables explanatory of the model; 
𝜷 is a vector K×1 of the parameters to be estimated; 
𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 is the scalar of idiosyncratic error. 

 
 
The third  specification  were used  in  the fourth  model  specification.  In  this  model  (PPML-MLR-Pair-
Mcluster),  we  used  the  multi-way  clustering  variance/covariance  matrix,  which  considers  all  possible  panel 
dimensions (importers, exporters and time) to make more robust inferences of the estimated parameters. Finally, 
each of these specifications will have four regression models (total, primary, textiles and manufactured imports). 
 
5.  Results 

 

The results of the four different specifications of the gravitational model were presented in Table 2. Nevertheless, 
it is useful to note that the PPML-Pair specification employs only country-pair fixed effects, and thus ignores the 
terms of multilateral resistance. In addition, as Baldwin and Taglioni (2006) emphasize if the model does not 
control the multilateral resistance, then the estimates would become biased, a situation that the authors called 
Gold Medal mistake. On the other hand, the PPML-MLR specification employs only exporter-year and importer-
year fixed effects, and it is not able to control the endogeneity of trade policy variables, as Baier and Bergstrand 
(2007) point out. In addition, this fixed effect provides more robust estimates for transport costs than the distance 
between countries and the other variables traditionally used in the gravitational model [see Baier and Bergstrand 
(2007); Egger and Nigai (2015)]. 

The PPML-MLR-Pair and PPML-MLR-Pair-Mcluster specifications include country-pair, importer-year 
and exporter-year fixed effects. Hence, they can be considered more robust than the others. The standard errors 
of the PPML-MLR-Pair-Mcluster specification are clustered on all possible dimensions of the panel (importer, 
exporter  and  time).  According  to  Larch  et  al  (2017),  this  multi-way  clustering  generally  leads  to  more 
conservative inferences of the estimated parameters. Indeed, the results of this fourth model (PPML-MLR-Pair-
Mcluster) seem to be more realistic, especially when compared to the two initial specifications (PPML-Pair and 
PPML-MLR). It is possible to note a significant decrease in the magnitude of the coefficients related to both the 
WTO and RTAs effects. In some cases, even the sign of the coefficient has changed. Thus, the analysis of the 
results focuses on the fourth model.

The joint analysis of the coefficients of the RTAs with the dummies  rta_wto and rta_nwto can indicate 
whether the regional openness was conditioned on multilateral liberalization. It is noteworthy that regionalism 
seems to have not affected the RTAs imports from non-members of the same RTA which is also a member of the 
WTO. Only in the primary sector, the RTAs were able to decrease extra-bloc imports, originating from members 
of  the  WTO,  since  rta_wto  was  negative and  significant  at  95%.12  Given  the  vast  discussion  in  the  literature 
addressing  whether  regionalism  constitute  a  threat  to  multilateralism,  this  result  signals  something  very 
important, that, with the exception of the primary sector, the RTAs examined may not be considered stumbling 
blocks.13 
Most of the RTA dummies exhibited no statistically significant coefficients. These estimates indicate that 
 
the RTAs did not promote intrabloc trade. One important exception is the EU, where the bloc had a positive effect 
on total trade among its members. Nonetheless, it is confined to the primary sector, as the coefficients related to 
textile  and  manufacturing  sectors  were  not  statistically  significant.  This  may  result  from  the  protectionist 
measures adopted by the EU against imports from the primary sector from non-member countries. Yet, there are 
three agreements (Cez, Sacu, and Safta) that exhibited a negative impact on trade in primary goods. 

Considering total imports, our estimates indicate that the WTO had no impact on total trade in the period 
1995-2014, for both developed and developing countries. Although our database covers a more recent period, 
this  result  confirming  the  estimates  by  Rose  (2004)  and  Roy  (2011).  At  first  sight  this  result  surprises,  but 
considering the difference between the periodicity of the data used in the papers it makes sense mainly for two 
reasons. First, manufactured goods have the largest share in world trade14. Second, import tariffs on manufactured 
goods were already low after the Uruguay Round. Our results using total trade data reflect the fact that import 
tariffs for manufactured products are already very low and that most of the international trade is of manufactured 
goods, so it is not possible to observe trade growth that can be attributed to the WTO. Moreover, this does not 
mean that this institution has never increased total trade, but rather that most of the WTO effects on manufactured 
goods are likely to have taken place before the Uruguay Round, i.e. during the GATT era. 

However,  analyzing  sectoral  trade  flows,  the  impacts  of  the  WTO  on  trade  is  asymmetric  between  the 
developed  and  developing  countries,  members  and  non-members.  We  find  that  the  WTO  effects  on  trade  in 
primary and textiles products were positive and significant, strongly differing from the estimates of Subramanian 
and  Wei  (2007).  Thus,  these  estimates  reinforce  the  importance  of  using  disaggregated  trade  data  to  make 
inferences about the impact of Regional and Multilateral liberalization on trade. 
 
Table 3 presents a summary of the estimated results to show that developed countries engaged in a non-
discriminatory trade openness benefited most from the WTO liberalization in the period examined. It is possible 
to note that the magnitude of this positive effect on primary goods was very similar for developed countries, with 
their imports growing above 70 percent, regardless of its origin (both developed or developing country or even 
from a non-member of WTO). It appears that non-members do seem to benefit equally from the liberalization by 
developed  countries  under  the  WTO.  Therefore,  there  is  evidence  that  the  Lerner  symmetry  hold  in  the  de 
multilateral system considering developed countries.15 

  The imports of primary products in developing countries members of the WTO from the other members 
grew by 36.8 percent in the period ([(𝑒0.313 − 1) × 100] = 36.8), while non-members of the institution did not 
benefit from the WTO (wtos_nwto). This important role in the opening up of the primary sector contrasts with 
those of the RTAs, which contributed to reduce trade in the sector in the period under review. In addition, WTO 
also increased by 116 percent trade among its developed members on textile products.  On the other hand, the 

                                                        
12 The variable rta_nwto was also not significant for total trade and seems to have affected negatively only imports from the 
textile sector. 
13  Bhagwati  (1991)  brought  this  discussion  to  light,  in  questioning  whether  regionalism  converges  to  multilateralism.  Some 
economists, such as Summers (1991) and Bergsten (1991), argue that the RTAs contribute to multilateral liberalization both by 
the progressive inclusion of new members and by the acceleration of multilateral trade negotiations. Thus, the formation of the 
block  would  move  towards  multilateralism,  characterizing  itself  as  building  block.  On  the  other  hand,  Bhagwati  (1991)  and 
Krugman (1991) identify RTAs as an obstacle to multilateral liberalization, especially for their potential to divert trade, because 
openness is discriminatory. Such blocks are known as stumbling blocks. 
14 According to WTO (2019), over 70 per cent of merchandise exports was manufactured goods in 2017. 
15 As Subramanian and Wei (2007) explains, the Lerner Symmetry suggest that, on average, WTO members tend to liberalize 
more than non-members. Therefore, the Lerner Symmetry implies that liberalization from member countries will generate more 
imports from WTO members (on average, liberalizers) than from non-members (non-liberalizers).

WTO failed to increase textile imports in developing countries. As expected, when importers and exporters were 
not part of the WTO (nwto_nwto), the trade was not affected by the multilateral agreement in the period.

Thus, the results obtained from the primary sector show that the asymmetry proposed by Subramanian and 
Wei  (2007)  has  reversed,  reflecting  efforts  made  during  the  Uruguay  Round  to  bring  agriculture  under  the 
GATT/WTO discipline, which were fundamental to further liberalization sector, leveraging world trade.16 The 
estimates found in this paper for the textile sector also contradict the results estimated by Subramanian and Wei 
(2007), who suggested that the WTO did not promote trade in these products, regardless of whether the countries 
were developed or developing.  

The increase in trade in textiles provided by the WTO can be justified by the advances made in the Uruguay 
Round for this sector. The textile sector has a history of being highly protected, with import quotas dominating 
the textile trade since the early 1960s. From 1974  until the end  of the Uruguay Round (1994), the  Multifibre 
Arrangement (MFA) governed textile trade. However, in the Uruguay Round it was established that the system 
should be eliminated within ten years through the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC)17 that succeeded 
the MFA. As of January 1, 2005, the sector was fully integrated with the general rules of the WTO. 

 

5.1   WTO trade effects over time 

 

As Eicher and Henn (2011) have pointed out, the effects of the WTO on trade can vary considerably over time. 
Considering  a  large  sample  covering  several  years  it  is  possible  the  effects  of  the  WTO  oscillates,  causing  a 
regression to exhibit a statistically insignificant coefficient, although the WTO effect could have been positive in 
some sub period. Trefler (2004) and Olivero and Yotov (2012) argue that the gravitational model in panel data 
should  be  estimated  considering  small  time  intervals  rather  than  using  a  sample  covering  several  decades. 
Estimations using smaller samples allows bilateral trade flows to adjust in response to changes in trade policy or 
trade costs. As the sample used in this paper cover a period of two decades, it is important to identify whether 
the WTO effects on trade vary over time. 

Table 4 presents the WTO effects on trade for every five years. Considering total trade, the coefficient of 
the dummy relating to developing country imports from WTO members indicate that there was no discrimination 
between members and non-members in the period 2005 to 2009, since both dummies (wtos_wto and wtos_nwto) 
are  positive  and  significant.  However,  the  magnitudes  of  these  coefficients  suggest  that  developing  country 
imports  from  non-members  is  greater  than  that  relating  to  imports  from  WTO  members.  In  other  words,  this 
means that developing countries did trade more with non-members than with WTO members in the period 2005 
to  2009,  which  is  somewhat  surprising.  Between  2010  and  2014,  WTO  non-members  traded  less  amongst 
themselves than the average set of countries on manufacturing products. This is also observed for the total imports 
in the period 1995 to 1999. 

The  results  for  trade  between  developed  WTO  members  show  positive  effects  on  imports  of  primary 
products  between  1995-1999  and  2000-2004.  This  same  positive  WTO  effects  on  primary  products  has  been 
observed on developing country imports from WTO members, but this occurs in a later period (2010-2014). In 
order to understand why WTO effects on primary products have impacted developed countries differently than 

                                                        
16 According to World Bank (2019), the average import tariff for primary products fell from 13.8% to 2.5% in developed countries and 
from 18.7% to 9% in developing countries between 1995 and 2014. 
17 The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing no longer exists: it’s the only WTO agreement that had self-destruction built in.

developing  countries  across  the  period  examined,  it  is  necessary  to  examine  the  basis  of  the  Agriculture 
Agreement.

The reform achieved in the Uruguay Round brought all the agricultural products listed in the Agriculture 
Agreement  under  the  WTO  discipline.  In  this  agreement,  member  countries  made  commitments  to  reduce 
protectionism in the agricultural sector on three main fronts: reduction of export subsidies, domestic support and 
import tariffs. However, the time and the magnitude of the reduction of protectionism that were provided for in 
the Agriculture Agreement were different between developed and developing countries. Countries’ reductions in 
agricultural subsidies and protection agreed in the Uruguay Round are reported in Table 5. 

Developing countries had 10 years to comply with the agreement (1995-2004), while developed countries 
had to meet their obligations within 6 years (1995-2000). In addition, trade liberalization in the agricultural sector 
was more intense for developed countries in terms of tariff reduction, domestic support cuts and export subsidies. 
As  a  result,  it  was  expected  the  WTO  effect  on  developing  countries  would  occur  later  than  on  developed 
members,  reflecting  the  longer  period  of  transition  and  softer  liberalization  commitments.  Our  results  are 
consistent with this difference in treatment foresee in the Agriculture Agreement, since that the WTO impacts on 

 

 

13 
 
developed countries were observed in the periods 1995-1999 and 2000-2004, while in developing countries it 
occurred only during the period 2010-2014. Furthermore, the magnitude of these effects on developed countries 
imports in the primary sector are bigger than those estimated in developing countries.

Note: Least-developed countries do not have to make commitments to reduce tariffs or subsidies. The base level for tariff cuts 
was the bound rate before 1 Jan 95; or, for unbound tariffs, the actual rate charged in Sept 86, when the Uruguay Round began. 
Only the figures for cutting export subsidies appear in the agreement. The other figures were targets used to calculate count ries’ 
legally binding “schedules” of commitments.

Figure 1: Developed country imports from other developed country WTO members 
 
In general, it is clear that the coefficients of developed countries import from other developed members 
are more stable compared to the imports from developing countries. With the exception of primary products, the 

 

 

 

 

14 
 
other coefficients of the imports from developing countries showed an upward trend, becoming significant for 
total trade from 2009. For three of the four aggregations - total, primary and manufacturing - the coefficients of 
developed country imports from other developed countries are not significantly in any year of the sample. The 
only exception are textiles, with the coefficient becoming significant and positive from 2000 onwards. Developed 
country imports from developing countries showed a similar behavior. The main difference is that the impact of 
the WTO on textile imports was observed later, from 2007, i.e. 7 years after this effect was observed in trade 
between developed countries and lasted less, only five years. 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2: Developed country imports from developing country WTO members 

 

The annual dummies of the WTO effects on trade in its developing members showed an upward trend in 
all  aggregations,  starting  with  significant  and  negative  coefficients  for  textiles  and  manufacturing  in  the  first 
years  of  the  sample.  Afterwards,  the  WTO  ceased  to  adversely  affect  trade  in  those  sectors,  even  affecting 
positively total imports and primary products in the last years of the sample, with the effects on total imports 
lasting longer when compared to imports of primary products. These results could be explained by the China's 
accession to the WTO in 2001 or by the more rigorous treatment associated with post-Uruguay Round accessions.

Finally, our results demonstrate that the dynamics of imports between developed and developing countries 
members differed not only in terms of volume, duration, and sector, but also in the speed at which the trade flows 
responded to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. 
 
5.2   New versus former Developing Country Members in the WTO 
 

Developing countries that joined the multilateral system in the GATT era had liberalization commitments 
that were softer than those imposed on new entrants after 1995. Indeed, many developing countries maintained 
sustained  tariffs  even  after  they  became members  of  GATT.18  However,  Tang  and  Wei  (2009)  show  that  the 
Uruguay  Round  caused  a  drastic change in  this  treatment,  since  developing  countries  were  subject  to  stricter 
requirements to join the WTO. 

This difference in treatment is tested in this subsection and refers to the fourth WTO asymmetry that was 
suggested by Subramanian and Wei (2007). Table 5 clarifies this question. For this, developing country members 
were divided between those who were members before the Uruguay Round of those who joined the institution 
after it (these coefficients were identified as new). Next, the gravitational model was again estimated, with the 
specification PPML-MLR-Pair-Mcluster, to test the hypothesis of the existence of this fourth asymmetry in the 
multilateral system. 
 
 

                                                        
18 Under the old GATT rules, a member could invoke non-application only on the condition that it has never entered into bilateral 
negotiations  with the acceding country. However, after the Uruguay  Round, a member could choose not to extend its WTO-
related benefits to a new member, even if they already have a history of bilateral negotiations (Tang and Wei, 2009).

First, most of the coefficients for new members changed signal, which confirms a modification of treatment 
associated  with  post-Uruguay  Round  accessions.  For  trade  in  primary  products,  the  new  developing  country 
members imported 65 percent more from other WTO members than the former developing countries. On average, 
these  new  members  imported  75  percent  more  from  non-WTO  members  than  the  former  members,  also 
considering  primary  products.  This  suggests  that  only  the  new  developing  members  have  extended  the  tariff 
reduction to all countries. Another point is that developing countries that have joined in the GATT era have only 
experienced a significant increase in their exports of primary products to developed countries. Considering trade 
between WTO members, the former developing countries export an average of 135 percent more for developed 
countries than new entrants developing members. 

These results corroborate those found by Subramanian and Wei (2007), confirming the existence of this 
fourth asymmetry in the WTO. Developing countries that joined the system before the Uruguay Round had a 
longer  period to  begin  the  process  of  multilateral  liberalization  and  the magnitude of  trade liberalization  was 
lower than for new members. According to Subramanian and Wei (2007), China is an example of this change of 
treatment.  China's  accession  to  the  WTO  in  2001  came  at  the  end  of  a  13-year  process  where  the  list  of 
liberalization obligations imposed on China has grown steadily. At the end of the transition period, China's trade 
regime was more open than most current WTO members. Figure 4 evaluates the simple mean tariff rate in select 
developing country members for every 5 years beginning in 1995 and ending in 2014. 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4: Evolution of the simple mean tariff rate in select developing country members (%) 
 
The Chinese tariff cut was higher than that observed in Brazil and India, both for all products and at the 
sectorial level (primary and manufactures). Although Mexico (former member) was more open than China in 
2014, the Chinese tariff reduction was more intense after the Uruguay Round, which also reflects the difference 
in  treatment  between  old  and  new  members.  However,  there  is  another  aspect  to  be  observed.  Given  the 

 

 

17 
 
heterogeneity  of  the  tariff  cut  among  developed  countries,  it  was  to  be  expected  that  the  WTO  effects  on 
developing  countries  imports  would  be  lower  than  on  developed  countries  imports,  and  our  results  have 
confirmed this. 

 

6.  Concluding remarks 

 

The results suggest that the WTO has positive impact on trade international trade flows, which differs from the 
results  of  Rose  (2004),  Eicher  and  Henn  (2011)  and  Roy  (2011),  but  this  growth  occurred  asymmetrically 
between the between developed and developing countries and between members and non-members. Although 
Subramanian  and  Wei  (2007)  also  found  positive effects  on  trade,  considering  these  four  asymmetries  of  the 
WTO,  we  show  that  some  of  these  did  not  hold  up  over  time.  The  results  suggest  that  the  first  asymmetry 
remained,  since  developed  countries  was  the  most  benefited  from  the  Multilateral  Agreement.  The  second 
asymmetry, which refers to discrimination between members and non-members of the WTO, was also partially 
found  in  this  paper.  These  results  was  expected,  since  the  most  favored  nation  clause  and  the  principle  of 
reciprocity  which  guide  the  WTO-coordinated  trading  system,  are  only  required  to  be  extended  to  the  WTO 
members, so non-members should not benefit from the multilateral trade liberalization. 

The third asymmetry proposed by Subramanian and Wei (2007) states that trade liberalization should be 
greater in the industrial sector, which implies that the agricultural and  textile sectors did  not  benefit from the 
WTO. However, our estimates suggest that this asymmetry has been reversed, since the largest impacts of the 
WTO on trade were observed in the primary and textile sectors in the period post-Uruguay Round. One possible 
explanation  for  this  result  is  that  the  other  papers  used  different  data  and  econometric  specifications.  In  this 
article, the data cover a more recent period, from 1995 to 2014, in which import tariffs for industrialized products 
were already at very low levels. In addition, the advances made in the Uruguay Round, especially the entry of 
agricultural and textile sectors under WTO discipline meant that the reduction in import tariffs for these products, 
which were much higher than those for industrialized products, promoted a growth in trade among members of 
the institution. And, in fact, the greatest trade liberalization, in terms of reducing import tariffs, occurred in the 
agricultural sector. The reduction in primary goods import tariffs from 1995 to 2014 was higher in developed 
countries  than  in  developing  nations,  from  an  average  of  13.78%  to  2.50%  and  from  18.68%  to  9.01%, 
respectively, which could potentially explain these new results. 

In the period 1995-2014,  developed countries were  the most benefited from the increase in world trade 
promoted by the WTO and its multilateral trade liberalization was not discriminatory, extend the benefits of their 
tariff cuts to non-members. In contrast, trade liberalization in developing countries was discriminatory and trade 
growth was seen only in primary and industrial products, but to a lesser extent than developed nations. Eicher 
and Henn (2011) have already suggested this, showing that the countries that made the largest tariff reductions 
during the WTO accession negotiations were those that had positive and significant WTO effects on trade. 

Finally, with the exception of the textile sector, the RTAs examined could be considered stumbling blocks, 
since our estimates confirm to a certain extent that they are obstacles to the multilateral openness, which confirms 
the hypothesis advocated by Bhagwati (1991) and Krugman (1991).
