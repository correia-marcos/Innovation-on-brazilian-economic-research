ABSTRACT 
The paper aims to analyze the features of the Brazilian structural change process in the period from 2000 to 
2014. More specifically, we investigate the intensity and nature of the deindustrialization process in sub-periods 
of  the  whole  period  under  consideration.  To  overcome  some  limitations  of  the  indicators  used  by  the  later 
literature  (the  sectoral  gross  output,  value-added  and  employment  shares),  we  apply  an  I-O  structural 
decomposition methodology that takes the effect of relative prices explicitly  to examine the contributions of 
different  factors  to  the  growth  of  total  gross  output  and  its  composition. We  utilize  a  series  of  I-O  Matrices 
valued at constant prices constructed by the GIC-UFRJ for the period 2000-2014, based on partial information 
from the Brazilian SNA and I-O matrix official statistics. Moreover, in our analysis, we regroup the whole set 
of extractive and manufacturing sectors into four industry groups according to the classification proposed by 
the GIC-UFRJ: processed agricultural commodities, traditional industry, industrial commodities, and innovative 
industry. Such classification allows us to interpret some distinctive characteristics of the Brazilian's productive 
structure since it captures specific features of the competition and technological flow patterns prevailing in the 
Brazilian economy in the period. The I-O structural decomposition analysis of the database described leads us 
to develop a different perspective in the debate about the Brazilian deindustrialization process. According to 
this perspective, this process is less intense and continuous than literature characterizes it.  In particular, we 
show that it is more significantly intense in the sub-period after the 2008 world crises and in the case of the 
traditional and innovative industries groups.

RESUMO 
O artigo tem como objetivo analisar as características do processo de mudança estrutural na economia brasileira 
no  período  de  2000  a  2014.  Mais  especificamente,  investigamos  a  intensidade  e  a  natureza  do  processo  de 
desindustrialização  para  todo  o  período  e  para  sub-períodos.  Para  tanto,  examinamos  os  efeitos  da  mudança 
estrutural  nas  fontes  de  mudança  estrutural  na  economia  brasileira.  Para  superar  algumas  limitações  dos 
indicadores  utilizados  pela  literatura  especializada  (valor  bruto  da  produção,  valor  agregado  e  ocupações), 
aplicamos  uma  metodologia  de  decomposição  estrutural  que  considera  explicitamente  o  efeito  de  preços 
relativos  para  examinar  as  contribuições  de  diferentes  fatores  crescimento  da  produção  bruta  total  e  sua 
composição.  Utilizamos  uma  série  de  Matrizes  Insumo-Produto  (MIP),  nominadas  a  preços  constantes, 
construídas  pelo  GIC-UFRJ  para  o  período  2000-2014,  com  base  em  informações  parciais  das  estatísticas 
oficiais  do  Sistema  de  Contas  Nacionais  e  da  MIP.  Reagrupamos  todo  o  conjunto  de  setores  extrativista  e 
manufatureiro  em  quatro  grupos  industriais  de  acordo  com  a  classificação  proposta  pelo  GIC-UFRJ: 
commodities  agrícolas  processadas,  indústria  tradicional,  commodities  industriais  e  indústria  inovativa.  Tal 
classificação permite interpretar algumas características distintivas da estrutura produtiva brasileira, uma vez 
que  captura  os  padrões  de  concorrência  e  fluxo  tecnológico  prevalecentes  na  economia  no  período.  A 
decomposição  estrutural  nos  leva  a  desenvolver  uma  perspectiva  sobre  a  desindustrialização  brasileira,  em 
especial porque incorpora o efeito dos preços relativos. De acordo com essa perspectiva, esse processo é menos 
intenso  e  contínuo  do  que  a  literatura  caracteriza.  Em  particular,  mostramos  que  é  mais  significativo  no 
subperíodo após a crise mundial de 2008 e no caso dos setores da indústria tradicional e inovativa.

STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE BRAZILIAN ECONOMY: a structural decomposition analysis for 2000-2014

1  INTRODUCTION 

 
Since  the  2000s,  many  studies  dedicated  particular  attention  to  analyzing  the  evolution  of  the 
productive structure of the Brazilian economy. One of the main topics of discussion is the existence and 
intensity of a process of deindustrialization and regressive specialization.  Most of this literature uses the 
fall  in  manufacturing  industries’,  gross  output,  value  added  and  employment  shares  as  indicators  in  the 
characterization of these processes. However, these indicators have some critical limitations when utilized 
for this purpose and cannot be used alone in this type of investigation. We argue that an analysis based on 
the indicators gains accuracy by the explicit use of an Input-Output (I-O) analytical framework.  

This paper aims to analyze the process of structural change in the Brazilian economy in the period 
between 2000 and 2015. More specifically, our investigation deals with the existence, nature, and intensity 
of the processes of deindustrialization and regressive specialization in such a period. To better characterize 
these processes, we subdivide the whole period into three subperiods: 2000-2003; 2003-2008; 2010-2014. 
Concerning  the  I-O  analytical  framework,  we  specifically  apply  an  I-O  structural  decomposition 
methodology  that  takes  the  effect  of  relative  prices  explicitly  to  examine  the  contributions  of  different 
factors  to  the  growth  of  total  gross  output  and  its  composition.  In  our  work,  we  utilize  a  series  of  I-O 
Matrices valued at constant prices constructed by GIC-UFRJ for the period 2000-2015, based on partial 
information from the Brazilian SNA and I-O matrix official statistics.  

By using this database, it is possible to take into account relative price effects, an essential feature 
of  the  Brazilian  and  others  developing  economies.  We  argue  that  the  exclusion  of  relative  price  effect 
contributes to the debate about deindustrialization and regressive specialization by increasing the accuracy 
of the analysis of the factors affecting the productive structure of the Brazilian economy. Moreover, in our 
analysis,  we  regroup  the  whole  set  of  extractive  and  manufacturing  sectors  into  four  industry  groups 
according  to  the  classification  proposed  by  GIC-UFRJ:  processed  agricultural  commodities,  traditional 
industry, industrial commodities, and innovative industry. Such classification allows us to interpret some 
distinctive  characteristics  of  the  Brazilian  productive  structure  since  it  captures  specific  features  of 
competition and technological flow patterns prevailing in Brazil. 

Besides this introduction, this paper has more four sections. Section 2 provides an overview of the 
Brazilian  economy  considering  a  macroeconomic  overview  and  some  structural  analysis.  Section  3 
describes methodological issues, as the data, input-output model and structural decomposition. In section 4 
we analyze the results of our structural decomposition analysis. Finally, the last section presents some final 
remarks.  
 

2  A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE PROCESS OF STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE 

BRAZILIAN ECONOMY 

 

Two concepts are usually used to understand and characterize the deindustrialization process. First, 
we have the classic concept of deindustrialization based on Rowthorn & Wells (1987) among others, that 
define deindustrialization as the continuous fall in manufacturing employment share. Secondly, there is the 
modern  one,  suggested  by  Tregenna  (2009)  for  example,  where  a  country  would  be  deindustrializing  if 
manufacturing value added share decreases comparing to other sectors, especially the services sector. 

However,  there  are  some  criticisms  regarding  the  use  of  these  indicators  to  characterize 
deindustrialization.  In  using  employment  as  a  measure,  it  is  not  possible  to  do  sectoral  change  analysis 
regarding production (Silva & Lourenço, 2016).  As the standard way to calculate the value added is by the 
difference between the gross output and the intermediate inputs, it is also affected by prices and quantities. 
Thus, deindustrialization analysis using value added data may be associated only to a change in relative 
prices (terms of trade) of the manufacturing industry to the general GDP deflator (Silva & Lourenço, 2016). 

 
 

3 

 

Also, Medeiros, Freitas, & Passoni (2018) discuss that analyzing deindustrialization by the shares 
of value added and employment is misleading because they argue that as the economic activity may affect 
the participation of manufacturing industries. It happens especially because the investment-output ratio e 
pro-cyclical, and the participation of industries intensive in capital goods must rise in the ascendant part of 
the cycle and reduce in the valley.  

To overcome those limitations, the authors suggest that the structural change in the economy is 
analyzing  a  combination  of  three  elements.  The  first  one  is  the  comparison  of  value  added  (and 
employment) of innovative industry group n total value added (and employment). The second one analyzes 
competitive  indicators  such  as  market  share  of  domestic  exports  on  world  exports  by  industry  and  the 
market share of imports in total supply. The last one is the density of the interindustry relations as captured 
by the input-output linkages indicators.  

This  work  concentrates  its  analysis  on  the  last  point,  using  the  input-output  approach.  Some 
studies use input-output indicators to analyze the existence of structural change of the Brazilian economy. 
Most of this studies use Rasmussen linkage indicators and key sectors to verify if there are changes in the 
backward and forward linkages. Some of them are  Morceiro (2012), Pires, Teixeira and, Rocha (2015), 
Marconi,  Rocha,  & Magacho (2016). The first  three ones concentrate their analysis up to  2009 because 
there was a change in the national system accounts that realized only in 2016 the input-output table (IBGE, 
2016). They found that there was a was a reduction in technical coefficients, not only for the manufacturing 
industry  but  also  for  all  economic  sectors.  Also,  a  common  result  is  that  although  the  manufacturing 
industry is reducing its linkages in the economy, this sector continues to be very important because they 
have high linkage effects, having the capability to stimulate other sectors.  

For  a  more  recent  period,  Passoni  &  Freitas  (2017)  shows  that  between  2010  and  2014  the 
manufacturing  activities  are  still  very  important  to  the  productive  structure,  but  this  important  is  more 
significant  in  the  traditional  industry.  Also,  they  show  based  on  the  power  and  sensitivity  of  dispersion 
indicators and its composition there was no significant change in the Brazilian economy between 2010 and 
2014. Medeiros, Freitas and, Passoni (2018) analyze these linkage indicators between a larger period, 2000 
and 2014, but focused on the innovative industry. They show that there were small changes between 2000 
and 2014, but exists an increasing tendency between 2000 and 2008 and a declining trend in the period 
from 2010 to 2014.  

Structural decomposition analysis (SDA) is also another input-output methodology used to identify 
the structural change in the Brazilian economy. Neves (2013), Persona and Oliveira (2016) and Magacho, 
McCombie  and  Guilhoto  (2018)  use  this  methodology  with  the  objective  to  verify  the  hypothesis  of 
deindustrialization  and  regressive  specialization.  Because  of  the  structural  data  availability,  this  studies 
analysis the Brazilian economy up to 2009. They use different databases and methods to construct a deflated 
IOT  series.  They  use  cell-specific  deflators,  double  deflation,  and  accumulated  quantum  indices 
respectively.  

All three works argue that the final demand is the source of change that contributes the most to the 
changes  in  gross  output  in  the  period.  Persona  &  Oliveira  (2016)  found  out  that  technological  change 
(changes on national technical coefficients) had a negative influence on employment (more expressively), 
value added, gross product and growth. The authors associate this change with technological innovation, 
changes in products composition, changes in relative prices and trade pattern. As this study ended in 2009, 
this must also be an effect of the negative performance in the Brazilian economy at this time. According to 
them, the hypothesis  of  regressive specialization is  correct,  as changes of  gross output and value added 
were related to industries based on natural resources and reduction of manufacturing sectors intensive in 
scale and technology importance.  

 Neves (2013) argues that there is not strong evidence of a marked process of deindustrialization 
between 2000 and 2008, whether from the perspective of occupations or under the gross output. The author 
bases  his  argument  on  the  idea  that  the  manufacturing  industry  had  the  greatest  contribution  among  all 
industries. However, as far as the trade pattern is concerned, there is import penetration in the manufacturing 
industry,  especially  more  marked  in  the  medium-low  and  medium-high  technology  sectors.  In  addition, 

 
 

4 

 
there is a negative contribution of the technological change to the gross output in volume in the period, 
which is mitigated by the change in relative prices. 

Magacho,  McCombie  and  Guilhoto  (2018)  found  that  the  technological  change  had  a  positive 
effect on the period, but the substitution of national inputs mitigate its result. The results suggest that there 
is a penetration of imported inputs, and this is essential to understand the Brazilian growth in the period 
analyzed.  In  a  sectoral  perspective,  the  authors  observe  that  substitution  of  national  inputs  is  more 
pronounced in high- and medium-high-technology manufacturing sectors. 

Although Persona and Oliveira (2016) and Magacho, McCombie, and Guilhoto (2018) deflate the 
IOT to consider the effects of the exchange rates’ volatility and relative price changes and analyze prices 
effect  and quantity separately, we argue that  both methods is  not  enough to  include with  relative prices 
changes in the structural decomposition analysis. In both methods, there is a missing step that must consider 
the  deflator  in  each  sector  concerning  the  total  gross  output.  This  step  guarantees  the  additivity  over 
industries  because  there  are  changes  in  the  relation  of  both  deflators.  Besides  that,  these  studies  do  not 
include the role of relative prices inside the SDA explicitly.  

Neves  (2013)  overcome  those  limitations  and  construct  a  database  that  guarantees  the  additivity 
over  industries  and  include  the  role  of  relative  prices  inside  the  SDA.  Besides  that,  the  way  the  author 
analyzes the role of relative prices is not the most accurate one once he analysis each effect separately. The 
role of relative prices has it meaning when analyzed in a global way inside the decomposition.    

In other to  overcome this  limitation, the novelty  of this work is  to  present  an SDA analysis that 
disentangles the changes in gross output in its volume changes and relative prices properly. Also, a new 
feature is that we use a more recent database that covers 15 years (2000-2014) that allow us to understand 
what  happened  in  the  Brazilian  productive  structure  after  2009.  We  argue  that  the  process  of 
deindustrialization have to have its focus those sectors that have the innovation capacity, primarily because 
it stimulates technological flows. 

 

3  METHODOLOGY  
 
3.1  Data and aggregation 

 
We utilize a series of I-O Matrices valued at relative constant prices of 2010, constructed by the GIC-
UFRJ for the period 2000-2015. The I-O matrices at current and prices of the previous year is constructed 
based on partial information from the Brazilian SNA and I-O matrix official statistics (IBGE, 2015; 2016), 
published by Passoni and Freitas (2018a; 2018b). 

Since our goal is to include the relative prices change in the context of SDA in the Brazilian case, we 
use also I-O tables valued at constant relative prices, as proposed in Casler (2006), Dietzenbacher and 
Temurshoev (2012), Hillinger (2002) and Reich (2008) and constructed by (Passoni & Freitas, 2018b).  

In  the  procedure  done  by  Passoni  and  Freitas  (2018b),  they  deflate  the  whole  series  of  estimated 
matrices at current and last year prices by the price index of total gross-output. Using this data is possible 
to isolate the contribution of relative price changes.  For that chained prices indices were constructed using 
cell-specific deflators to put all the I-O Tables at the base year, in this case, 2010. At the decomposition we 
present in this work, this data is related to what we will call ‘volume effect,' that expresses the change in 
production of the specific good or service in question. In this way, they purge the inflation effect and the 
IOT a series that Passoni and Freitas (2018b) presents is compatible over time. 

To  obtain  deflated  IOT  additivity  another  step  is  necessary.  Passoni  and  Freitas  (2018b)  also 
adjusted the previous series for relative prices to obtain a series at constant relative prices, as suggested by 
Balk  & Reich, 2008; Dietzenbacher & Temurshoev, 2012; Diewert, 2015; Reich, 2008. They make this 
adjustment though dividing each relative price (cell-specific deflators) by the total gross output deflator. It 
guarantees  consistent  deflated  input-output  tables.  This  step  allows  isolation  of  the  variation  of  one 
commodity price relative to the other commodities, caused by the forces of supply and demand on each 
commodity market. So, we will name this price adjustment as ‘relative prices effect.' 

 
 

5 

 

We observe that relative price changes have a meaningful impact when doing sectoral analysis in 
the  period  analyzed  in  this  study.  Although,  most  of  the  studies  of  the  Brazilian  process  of 
deindustrialization do not analyze this aspect, and this may influence the observed results.  

Relative to the data used, the decomposition procedures were calculated based on 91 commodities by 
42  sectors.  This  disaggregation  level  is  the  most  disaggregated  data  possible  for  an  IOT  large  series  of 
Brazilian  national  accounts1  For  organization  and  disclosure  of  results,  we  regroup  the  whole  set  of 
extractive and manufacturing sectors into four industry groups according to the classification proposed by 
GIC-UFRJ 

•  Processed agricultural commodities (PAC): sectors intensive in natural and energy resources, being 

• 

generally associated with agribusiness and homogeneous products of high tonnage; 
Industrial  Commodities  (IC):  natural  resource  intensive  activities  related  to  mineral  extractive 
industry, metallurgy and basic chemistry; 

•  Traditional  industry  (IT):  industries  that  produce  goods  with  less  technological  content,  with  few 
requirements  regarding  productive  scale;  production  of  wage  goods,  inputs,  industrial  parts  and 
complements, and manufactured consumer goods; 

•   Innovative industry (IN): more sophisticated activities in technology and organization terms on the 

production process that most contribute to the technology diffusion process in the economy; 
 

The description of the sectors that contain this classification is in the appendix. 

As suggested by Medeiros, Freitas, & Passoni (2018), this classification is better than others based 
only on the technological intensity of products (such as OECD intensity classification). It captures supply 
factors, such as the global pattern of competition and technological flow and also aspects related to demand, 
as the technological intensity of demanding manufacturing and extractive goods. Such classification allows 
us  to  interpret  some  distinctive  characteristics  of  the  Brazilian  productive  structure  and  has  essential 
meaning when analyzing the process of deindustrialization.  
 
3.2 
 

I-O model in the context of relative prices 

The gross output (𝐱) in the I-O model is:  

𝐱 = (𝐈 − 𝐀𝐧)−𝟏𝐟𝐧 

(1) 

where  𝐀𝐧  (𝑛 × 𝑛)  is  the  matrix  of  domestic  technical  coefficients;  (𝐈 − 𝐀𝐧)−𝟏  (𝑛 × 𝑛) is  the  Inverse 
Leontief Matrix, and 𝐟𝐧 is the domestic final demand (𝑛 × 1), and n is the number of sectors in the model.  
In the Brazilian IOT 𝐀𝐧 and 𝐟𝐧 are obtained from the Use Table of national products at basic prices, 
 
which  contains  the  information  of  intermediate  demand  of  commodities  by  sector  and  final  demand  of 
commodities  (𝑛 × 𝑘,  with  k  commodities).  To  transform  this  information  according  to  the  industry 
technology model we use a market share matrix (𝐃) to transform demand of commodities into the demand 
of sectors. This matrix is defined as follows:   

(2) 
where 𝐕 is the transposed matrix production (𝑛 × 𝑘) and 𝐪 the gross output value by commodity (𝑘 × 1). 
 Let 𝐔𝐧 be the flow matrix of intermediate demand for national products at basic prices. Thus, we 

𝐃 = 𝐕𝐪̂ 

obtain the commodity by sector matrix of national technical coefficients 𝐁𝐧, as follows:  

𝐁𝐧 = 𝐔𝐧𝐱̂ −𝟏 

Next, by premultiplying 𝐁𝐧 by 𝐃 we obtain 𝐀𝐧:  

𝐀𝐧 = 𝐃. 𝐁𝐧 

(3). 

(4). 

Likewise, we obtain the vector of final demand by sector (𝐟𝐧) by premultiplying the vector of final demand 
by commodities (𝐝𝐅𝐧) by 𝐃 such as:  

𝐟𝐧 = 𝐃. (𝐝𝐅𝐧) 

(5). 

                                                 

1 For more details of this procedure, see Passoni and Freitas (2018a). 

 
 

 
Using (4) and (5) we present gross output as:   

6 

(6). 
We can express sectoral gross output as follows, to capture the changes in volume and prices,  
(7) 

𝐱 = 𝐃. 𝐁𝐧𝐱 + 𝐃. 𝐝𝐅𝐧 

𝐱 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩𝐱𝐯 

with 𝐱̂ 𝐩 represents the relative price effect and 𝐱𝐯 is gross output volume. The changes in the prices here 
𝑝
𝑝 𝑝⁄ , where 𝑥𝑗
represents the relative price effect, mentioned in the previous section, and we define 𝐱̂ 𝐩 = 𝑥𝑗
 
is the price index of the sector j and 𝑝 the price index of total gross output deflator.  

 

As we aim to capture the influence of relative prices in the IO model components, we rewrite 

all variables disaggregating relative price and volume terms. The elements of the 𝐔𝐧 matrix becomes:  

𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗 =

𝑝
𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗
𝑝

𝑣  
× 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗

(8) 

𝑝
Where  𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗
measure of commodity i used as an input by industry j.  

  is  the  relative  price  of  commodity  i  used  as  an  input  by  industry  j,  and  𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗

𝑣   is  the  volume 

Using (7) and (8) in (3) , the elements of 𝐁𝐧 are given by: 

𝑝
𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗
𝑝
𝑝
𝑥𝑗
𝑝
𝐩 = [𝑏𝑛𝑖𝑗
Let us define the elements of matrices 𝐁𝐧
𝑝 =

𝑏𝑛𝑖𝑗 =

𝐯 = [𝑏𝑛𝑖𝑗

𝑣 ] as follows: 

 and 𝑏𝑛𝑖𝑗

𝑣 =

𝑣
𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗
𝑣  
𝑥𝑗

Thus, using the symbol ⊗ to denote the Hadamard product, the 𝐁𝐧 matrix can be expressed in the following 
way: 

𝐩 ⊗ 𝐁𝐧
𝐯 
𝐁𝐧 = 𝐁𝐧
 

 is  the matrix of relative price indices, and 𝐁𝐧

𝐩
𝐯 is  the matrix of national  technical  coefficients 
where, 𝐁𝐧
measured in volume terms, both related to the commodity by industry national technical coefficient matrix.  
As  to  the  final  demand,  let  us  define  the  commodity  relative  price  of  the    final  demand  vector 

𝐩
(𝐝𝐅𝐧

): 

𝐩 = 𝑑𝐹𝑛𝑗
𝐝𝐅𝐧

𝑝 /𝑝 

(12). 

Next, we can decompose the final demand vector in its relative price and volume components, obtaining 
the expression below: 

𝐩 𝐝𝐅𝐧
𝐯  
 represents the volume final demand vector. 

𝐝𝐅𝐧 = 𝐝𝐅𝐧

where 𝐝𝐅𝐧

𝐯

Finally, for the market-share matrix, the approach was somewhat different. First, the volume market 

share (𝐃𝐯) was calculated using constant prices data: 
𝐃𝐯 = 𝐕𝐯𝐪𝐯̂ 

(14). 

Since there is not a direct relative prices deflator to D (𝐃𝐩) that guarantees consistent aggregation, 
we calculate it by the cell-by-cell Hadamard division (⊘) of market share matrix calculated using constant 
relative prices data (𝐃) and constant relative prices data (𝐃𝐯). 

 
Doing so, we represent D as: 

𝐃𝐩 = 𝐃 ⊘ 𝐃𝐯 

𝐃 = 𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯 

Back to equation (6), we have now: 
𝐱̂ 𝐩𝐱𝐯 = (𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯)(𝐁𝐧

𝐩 ⊗ 𝐁𝐧

𝐯)𝐱̂ 𝐩𝐱𝐯 + (𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯). (𝐝𝐅𝐧

Solving the last equation for the vector of gross output in volume terms we obtain

𝐱𝐯 = [𝐈 − (𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏(𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯)(𝐁𝐧

𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏(𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯). (𝐝𝐅𝐧

To simplify the above equation, we denote 𝐀̃𝐧 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏(𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯)(𝐁𝐧

This equation is interesting because it allows us to identify the volume contribution to changes in 

gross output (the volume effect), leaving aside the relative price contribution.  

 
 

3.3  A proposed indicator of the share of industries in gross output    

 
Before doing the decomposition itself, we propose an indicator that compares the sectoral growth 
share of  each industry  group with  the total  economy. With this, we can  see if each industry is  growing 
above  or  below  the  total  gross  output.  Notably,  we  are  interested  in  analyzing  the  performance  of  the 
innovative industry group concerning the economy, as it is the industry that can stimulate technological 
flow in the economy.   

If we consider 𝜏 as the share of each extractive and manufacturing industry group (𝑥𝐺

𝑣) in the total 

gross output volume (𝑥𝑣), as in: 

𝜏 =

𝑣
𝑥𝐺
𝑥𝑣 

(20) 

with 𝐺 as industrial commodities, processed agricultural commodities, traditional industry and innovative 
industry.  

We can measure the growth rate of 𝜏 (𝑔𝜏) using the growth rates of 𝑥𝐺

𝑣 and 𝑥𝑣: 

in this way:

(22). 

If 𝑔𝜏   < 1 it means that the group growth rate is lower than the total gross output in volume. In this sense, 
it contributes to the decline in the share and will indicate that the participation of each group is falling in 
the period. The previous equations (34), (35) and (36) are also calculated using the total gross output. The 
comparison between them also gives the importance of taking apart the relative price effect.  

 

3.4  Structural decomposition 

 
The structural decomposition analysis (SDA) approach is a technique that disaggregates the change 
of some economic aspect into various components contributions - disaggregating an identity into several 
components (Miller & Blair, 2009). Any economic variable can be decomposed into its elements, enabling 
a better understanding of the variation between two periods. 

The variable of interest, in this paper, is the change in Brazilian gross output (𝐱) between 2000 and 
2015,  and  three  subperiods:  2000-2003,  2003-2008  and  2010-2015.  With  it,  we  propose  a  two-level 
decomposition. The first one disaggregates the change of gross output presented in equation (7) in changes 
in total volume (𝐱𝐯) and total relative prices (𝐱𝐩).  

 
 

 

The  decomposition  follows  Dietzenbacher  &  Los  (1998)  and  Miller  &  Blair  (2009),  using  the 
average of the two extreme decomposition situations. Denote '0' and '1' as superscripts for the initial and 
final, respectively. So, the gross output change (𝚫𝐱) of equation (7), then, becomes:

(23) 
(24) 

We express all the decomposition's results regarding its contribution to total gross output growth. To obtain 
this contribution, we must divide each variable in (19) concerning initial gross output 𝑥0. 

For its turn, the second level decomposition departs from changes of total volume (𝐱𝐯).  
 
In  this  second  level,  we  separate  volume  contribution  from  the  relative  prices  contribution  to 𝐱𝐯 
𝐯 . The

price contribution corresponds to the changes in 𝐱̂ 𝐩, 𝐁𝐧

𝐯 , and, 𝐝𝐅𝐧

.  

𝐩, and 𝐝𝐅𝐧

𝐩

To this decomposition, we apply the difference between all the variables at the final and at the initial 

point in (17) to find 𝚫𝐱𝐯 and its volume and price effect contribution. So, we have: 

After the methodological procedures, presented in the appendix, the structural decomposition results 

𝚫𝐱𝐯 = 𝚫(𝐙̃𝐟̃

𝐧) 

(25) 

in the following equation: 

𝚫𝐱𝐯 = [ (𝐀̆𝐧

𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 (𝛒)

where  [… ]̆   represents  the  changes  between  the  final  and  initial  period  inside  the  𝚫𝐱𝐯  for  each  variable 
assigned. At this point, we define 𝐟𝐧 as being the final demand excluded inventories (𝒔). We do this because 
inventories  do  not  have  economic  meaning  as  it  used  as  a  residual  account  on  SNA.  To  obtain  the 
contribution to gross output, we must divide each variable in (21) concerning initial gross output 𝑥0.  

(26) 

So, the volume contribution is the sum of the volume changes in the national intermediate demand 
𝐯 , the final demand 𝐟̆
𝐀̆𝐧
𝐯 and the market share contribution 𝐃̆ 𝐯. The price contribution takes into account the 
𝐧
effect  of  total  relative  prices,  the  change  in  the  relative  prices  inside  national  intermediate  inputs 
coefficients, final demand and market share matrix.  

We must notice that 𝐀̆ 𝐧

•  Volume contribution (𝜐) and sources of change 

 

All the previous procedure was done to isolate the changes in the Brazilian gross output related to 

volume.  

In this section, we analyze the volume contribution to gross output in volume, expressed at (26). In 
other to better identify the factors that contribute to changes in output, we propose the following sources of 
change: trade pattern, technological change, and final demand. The changes in the trade pattern reflect the 
effect  of  penetration/substation  of  inputs  or  final  goods  and  services.  The  technological  change's 
contribution  shows  the  consequence  of  a  change  in  the  `production  recipe´.  The  last  factor  is  the  final 
demand's contribution that displays the effect of the variations of final demand in the gross output.   

To capture all these effects, we express all national variables in total demand and imported demand. 
The changes in matrix 𝐀𝐧 is due to variations in the technology itself (𝐀) or also on the trade pattern of 
imported  inputs,  we  calculate  national  technological  coefficients  as  a  difference  between  total  technical 
coefficients (𝐀) and imported technical coefficients (𝐀𝐦), as:   

 
 

 

As observed in (10) and (11), 𝐀 and 𝐀𝐦 are:  

 𝐀 = (𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯). (𝐁𝐩 ⊗ 𝐁𝐯) 
𝐩 ⊗ 𝐁𝐦
𝐀𝐦 = (𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯). (𝐁𝐦
𝐯 ) 

𝐀𝐧 = 𝐀 − 𝐀𝐦 

9 

(27). 

(28) 
(29). 

In  this  sense,  variations  in  𝐀  will  express  the  contribution  to  technological  change,  and  the 
contribution of 𝐀𝐦 shows the changes in the trade pattern of inputs in the Brazilian economy. Note that as 
Brazilian SNA express the inputs information in a commodity-by-sector level, we observe these changes 
in 𝐁 and 𝐁𝐦 changes. 

However, the change in the technology itself may demand more imported inputs than was previously 
necessary. An increase/decrease in total imports this way may not be related to a change in trade pattern, 
such as penetration or substation of imports, but only reflects the technological needs for production. To 
isolate  this  effect,  as  Schuschny  (2005)  and  Kupfer,  Freitas,  &  Young  (2003)  propose,  we  estimate  an 
auxiliary matrix of imported technological coefficients.  

The basic idea of this hypothesis  is  disaggregating the  changes in  𝐁𝐦

𝐯  that are influenced by the 
changes  in  the  technology  and  the  one  which  is  due  exclusively  to  the  trade  pattern.  As  technological 
requirements  are  better  analyzed  considering  only  the  volume,  we  calculate  this  auxiliary  matrix  of 
imported technological coefficients (𝐁̌𝐦
𝐯 ) supposing that it grows proportionally based on the rate of growth 
𝑣 ), denoted as

reflecting  a  change  in  competitive  imports.  When  we  insert  this  information  into  the  structural 
decomposition, we express the changes in 𝐁 (commodity-by-sector) matrices in the 𝐀 matrices (sector-by-
sector). In this way, we rearrange the volume contribution of national technical coefficients 𝐀̆𝐧

where the first part of the previous equation represents the changes in the intermediate trade pattern and the 
second one represents the contribution of national technological change.   

We do the disaggregation of national final demand in total and imported, excluded inventories, as 

expressed at:

We  disaggregate  final  demand  in  consumption  (c),  which  includes  private  and  government

Putting together all the previous elements, the volume contribution to gross output in volume, when 

analyzed by the sources of change, is expressed as:

To obtain the contribution to gross output, we must divide each variable in (31) to initial gross output 𝑥0. 
The  changes  in  technology  are  related  to  column-specific  changes,  as  a  simplification  (Miller  & 
Blair, 2009). As each column of 𝐀 shows the way of production of each sector (the ‘sector's production 
recipe'), the change column by column extracts the effect of input changes in each sector of the economy. 
So, this changes in technological coefficients will show the changes in input needs for the production in 
each sector. It is related to the ‘fabrication effect,' and determinate the type of inputs that the production of 
each  sector  depends  on  the  most  (i.e.,  if  the  technology  depends  more  intensive  in  high-technologic  or 
labor-skilled inputs). 

This way of rearranging the information allows characterizing the changes in the Brazilian economy 

structure. Figure 4 shows an alternative form to visualize the decompositions.

Although  the  decomposition  is  done  to  total  gross  output  (𝚫𝐱)  and  𝚫𝐱𝐯,  only  the  volume 
contribution  to  𝚫𝐱𝐯  (highlighted  in  Figure  4)  is  going  to  be  analyzed  on  the  following  section  with  the 
results.  

One  way  to  present  decomposition  is  as  the  rate  of  growth  of  gross  output,  after  normalizing 
(dividing) by the total initial gross output. In this case, we must have to pre-multiply volume (υ) and price 
contribution  (𝜌)  by  sectoral  relative  prices.  This  step  is  necessary  for  the  proper  aggregation  between 
sectors. After this, it is possible to normalize to obtain the sectoral growth's contribution. The following 
section presents results of these decompositions.  

 

4  RESULTS 
 

Before presenting the decomposition itself, we present the manufacturing and extractive industries 
share on total gross output in Figure 5. We present two different share series one Total (TOT), related to 𝐱, 
and  other  in  volume  (VOL),  corresponds  to  𝐱𝐯.  This  figure  helps  us  to  visualize  the  benefits  of 
desegregating volume and relative prices.  

As  can  be  seen  on  the  graph,  it  is  possible  to  observe  the  relative  price  effect  by  the  difference 

between bold (VOL) and dotted (TOT) line.  

The industries TI and IC have more changes in their relative prices among the periods. This change 
usually  increases  their  participation  in  total  gross  output.  This  graph  also  indicates  that  the  process  of 

 
 

 
deindustrialization in Brazil is less intense and continuous as literature characterize it, due to relative price 
effects. The reduction of these industries share on gross output may be associated with other questions than 
deindustrialization itself, i.e., by the economic performance.

Analyzing the growth rate of IN volume’s share as presented in Table 1, we see that its participation 
had positive growth during 2000-2014 and 2003-2008. In both periods, this extractive and manufacturing 
group was the only one that its growth was higher than the gross output in volume. The weak economic 
performance in 2000-2003 is maybe the cause of the negative growth of the share of this industry group. 
These both facts are connected with the relationship between investment-output ratio and its connection 
with the macroeconomic performance of the economy.

The  positive  growth  share  of  IN  in  2003-2008  and  2000-2014  happened  because  there  was  an 
increase in the investment-output ratio in these periods (MEDEIROS, FREITAS, PASSONI, 2018), that 
lead new productive capacity and new investments. Comparing what happened in 2000-2014 and 2010-
2014, with an IN annual volume contribution to total gross output of 2.98pp and 3.06pp (Table 2) and gross 
output growth of 2.85% and 2.33%, what must justify the growth of all industries groups, but especially the 
innovative industry is the reduction of its importance in the Brazilian economy. As mentioned by Medeiros, 
Freitas, and Passoni (2018), there was a declining trend of backward and forward linkages in the Brazilian 
economy between 2010 and 2014.  

Table 1 also helps us to visualize the importance of taking the relative prices apart from the analysis 
of deindustrialization. Analyzing the same indicator for the total share, we see the share of the industries 
increasing in the periods. The difference between them shows the effect of the changes in relative prices,

that is more pronounced with the IC and PAC, but also by the opposite sign and magnitude in the innovative 
industry. 

Both previous helps to see the importance of relative prices on structural analysis, and its importance 
in  a  more  explicit  way  if  we  see  when  analyzing  the  growth.  By  doing  the  decomposition  analysis,  is 
possible to verify if the changes on gross output are due to reasons that the literature generally associates 
with deindustrialization, as the loss of competitiveness of the domestic market, seen by trade pattern, or by 
the economic deceleration.  

In Table 2 we see the decomposition analysis for 2000 and 2014 and selected periods, for the whole 
economy. The first level of the decomposition disaggregates the total gross output change (A) in the volume 
effect (B) and Relative price effect (C). The relative price effect’s contribution is very low for the aggregate, 
but for a sectoral analysis, its importance is more apparent.

Source: Author’s elaboration based on the SNA/IBGE and I-O Tables/GIC-UFRJ and Passoni & Freitas (2018a, 2018b). 

 
The  second  level  disaggregation  is  for  the  volume  effect  (B),  disaggregated  in  the  volume 
contribution  (D),  relative  prices  contribution  (E)  and  inventories.  The  relative  prices  contribution  has  a 
substantial  effect  not  only  at  the  disaggregated  level  but  also  in  the  aggregate  one.  It  usually  tends  to 
underestimate the volume contribution or the changes due to real factors. As mentioned at the methodology, 
only the volume contribution (D) to gross output in volume is going to be analyzed the results.  

Table 3 is presented the volume contribution to gross output in a sectoral perspective, and also for 
the aggregate. Among all subperiods, 2003-2008 had the highest accumulated volume contribution, due to 
the intense period's economic activity. We can explain this performance by favorable external conditions 
and an active internal macroeconomic policy, founded on the growth of public expenditures (consumption 
and investment) and credit expansion for household’s consumption and investment  (Serrano  & Summa, 
2012). Also, there was an improvement in the labor market and gains in real wages, and with inflation was 
under control, and there was an improvement in income distribution and poverty indicators. 

 The most important source of change to volume contribution in all subperiods is the final demand. 
The domestic demand represents the higher participation on final’s demand contribution, except for 2000-
2003. The external  demand  was  significant  in this period because  Brazilian economic activity  was very 
week due the high-interest rates adopted after the balance-of-payments crisis and presented a depreciation 
of exchange rate.  

When analyzing the disaggregated data, we see that IC and TI ins the ones that contributed the most 
to the external demand (0.08pp and 0.06pp). A fact that helps us to understand it is the share of exports of 
IC  increased  its  share  in  total  Brazilian  exports  (9%)  and  also  in  world’s  market  (40%)  at  2000-2003 
(MEDEIROS,  FREITAS,  PASSONI, 2018).  In the case of TI, although it has a significant  contribution 
(0.06pp), the share of exports in  total  national  exports (-5%) and the  world’s exports (-12%)  fallen this 
period. It indicates that besides this decline, this sector for this period is also significant to gross output.  

The technological change due to the variation of national technical coefficients had a positive impact 
in 2000-2014 and 2010-2014. This effect is more marked in the Services, although IC also has significant 
participation.  In 2010-2014 the proportion of this effect (at about 30% of total volume contribution) was 
the higher among all periods and had the higher annual contribution (0.51pp).

The effect of non-competitive imports is minimal in almost all periods, and for 2000-2014 and 2010-2014 
they were negative (-0.03pp and -0.14pp).  

In  2000-2003,  the  total  technological  change  had  a  negative  contribution  of  0.05pp.  This  effect  is 
probably related to the effects of trade liberalization that took place in the 1990's and still had an impact on 
this period. Also, we can see this adverse effect is common in a sectoral perspective. In 2003-2008 we also 
saw a negative contribution of technological change, but its sectoral composition is different. All extractive 
and manufacturing sectors had a negative contribution to the total gross output, indicating that the ‘recipe 
of production’ contributes in a negative way for the gross output.  

There  is  penetration  of  imports  on  intermediate  inputs  in  total  market  supply  for  all  subperiods.  It 
represents a loss of competitiveness of national market against the imported suppliers. Also, this effect is 
more marked in the ones where the economic growth is higher, like 2000-2014 (-0.37pp) and 2003-2008 (-
0.84pp). Besides that, is in 2000-2003 that this effect represents the higher proportion among all sources of 
change, representing almost -30% of 0.24pp. These may be in function of the low economic dynamic in 
this subperiod. 

Also, we see the process of penetration of imports in the final demand. This  fact is common among 
almost all sub-periods, except for 2000-2003 where there is a substitution of imported for national goods 
supply. We attribute this different pattern to exchange rate depreciation, and also to the weak performance 
in the economy.  

In a sectoral level, there is penetration of imports for intermediate inputs and final demand for most 
sectors in 2000-2014, 2000-2003 and 2003-2008 for all industries groups. Besides that, some sectors have 
their penetration of imports higher in intermediate demand than in the final demand. These sectors are IC 
and  Services.  The  opposite  to  this  happens  with  TI  (more  concentrated  in  consumption)  and  IN

(concentrated in GFCF), where the final demand penetration is higher. In 2000-2014, the IN was the one 
which had the higher penetration of imports between extractive and manufacturing industries, and in its 
case, this happened in a more significant proportion because final goods (-0.09pp compared to -0.04pp of 
intermediate inputs).  

In 2003-2008 we can say that there is a substantial effect of penetration of imports in consumption and 
GFCF, with a negative contribution of -0.40pp and -0.32pp. In 2010-2014 we visualized that the effect of 
weak economic activity leads to a null contribution of this effect for gross fixed capital formation. This fact 
is different in general from other sectors, which generally had their penetration of imports of intermediate 
inputs higher than final demand. It happens because there is a dependency on imported final goods, such 
as machinery and equipment.  
 
5  FINAL REMARKS 
 

This paper contributes to the debate of deindustrialization because it considers explicitly the role of 
relative  price  effects  and  how  it  affects  this  debate.  We  showed  that  taking  apart  relative  prices  effects 
guarantee accuracy on results. Also, the proposed I-O structural decomposition analysis is an alternative 
way to see the changes in the Brazilian productive structure. As well we use a new database that allows us 
to contribute with more recent information.  

The  hypothesis  of  the  process  of  regressive  specialization  may  be  affected  by  relative  prices. 
Relative  price  effect  has  an  impact  on  IC,  mainly  because  of  the  rising  tendency  of  international 
commodities  prices  that  started  in  2003  and  intensified  in  the  following  year  (Lima  e  Silva,  Prado,  & 
Torracca, 2016). Without taking apart the effects of relative prices, it generally influences in a positivity 
way its contribution to output growth. So, if analyzed the total effect, its participation on gross output is 
overestimated. 

Among  all  manufacturing  industries,  when  disaggregated  the  contribution  to  volume  effect  is 
considered, the Traditional and Innovative industry's final demand are the industries which had importance 
on the period of high growth. It happens because there is a positive relationship between the trend rate of 
GDP growth and the investment-output ratio.   

So, when there is economic growth (deceleration) the participation of manufacturing industries may 
rise (follow) because there is an increase (decrease) demand for manufacturing products (capital goods). In 
periods  of  weak  growth,  the  positive  disaggregated  gross  output  in  volume  growth  is  generally  due  to 
services sectors, that contraposes the weak manufacturing and extractive performance. 

According to this perspective, such deindustrialization process is less intense and continuous than 
it is usually characterized in the literature when considering relative prices effect and analyzing the volume 
change in volume gross contributions in a broader perspective.  

Besides that, we see that something happened before 2010, that even with a considerable average 
of growth, the innovative industry has grown on a low path compared to the total gross output in volume. 
This is also seen by other authors, like Medeiros, Freitas, and Passoni (2018) and must indicate that there 
is some evidence that these industry group is losing its capacity to stimulate the economy. Also, another 
fact  that  may  justify  this  fact  is  that  is  the  reasons  that  explain  the  economic  growth  in  the  period,  not 
marked by the trajectory of GFCF. 

Also, the intense process of penetration of imports on market’s inputs and final goods demand is 
not favorable for the Brazilian economy. This seems recurrently by all periods, just changing its intensity 
because  of  the  economic  activity.  These  are  some  preliminary  results,  and  a  more  in-depth  analysis 
considering the sources of capital goods in the GFCF may contribute to understanding the role of investment 
and the innovative industry for the productive structure.

I-O model on the context of relative prices 
 

To solve the I-O model on the context of relative prices, we substitute we part form the following equation:  

By doing the substitution of 𝐱 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩𝐱𝐯 we have:  

𝐱 = 𝐀𝐧𝐱 + 𝐟𝐧 

Solving for 𝐱𝐯 by premultiplying the previous equation for 𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏

 

𝐱̂ 𝐩𝐱𝐯   = 𝐀𝐧𝐱̂ 𝐩𝐱𝐯 + 𝐟𝐧 

To simplify the previous equation, we define 𝐀𝐧

∗ = 𝐀𝐧𝐱̂ 𝐩 

and also 𝐀𝐧̃ = 𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏𝐀𝐧

∗  and 𝐟𝐧

̃ = 𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏𝐟𝐧. So, we have: 

𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏𝐱̂ 𝐩𝐱𝐯   = 𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏𝐀𝐧𝐱̂ 𝐩𝐱𝐯 + 𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏𝐟𝐧 

𝐱𝐯   = 𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏𝐀𝐧𝐱̂ 𝐩𝐱𝐯 + 𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏𝐟𝐧 

𝐱𝐯   = 𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏𝐀𝐧

∗ 𝐱𝐯 + 𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏𝐟𝐧

̃ , where 𝐙̃ = (𝐈 − 𝐀𝐧̃ )
𝐟𝐧

Solving for xv, we have: 𝐱𝐯   = (𝐈 − 𝐀𝐧̃ )
̃  
effect In this way we can express the gross output in volume as: 𝐱𝐯   = 𝐙̃𝐟𝐧
 
Structural decomposition  
 
We find the changes in the gross output in volume between the final and initial period in the following way: 

̃  
𝐱𝐯   = 𝐀𝐧̃ 𝐱𝐯 + 𝐟𝐧
 is the Leontief matrix taking account relative prices

̃ ) 
𝚫𝐱𝐯   = 𝚫(𝐙̃𝐟𝐧

 
 

 
As suggested by Dietzenbacher & Los (1998) and Miller & Blair (2009), we calculate the decomposition of the previous 
equation by the mean of the two extreme cases: 

17 

As we want to desegregate the variations of the Leontief matrix, we also have to the decomposition for 𝚫𝐙̃. As suggested by 
Miller & Blair (2009), it becomes:  

𝚫𝐱𝐯 =

Also, we want to take a deep look at the determinants of 𝚫𝐀𝐧̃ , so we also do the decomposition for it. Remembering that 𝐀𝐧̃ =
𝐱̂ 𝐩−𝟏𝐀𝐧

∗ , so we have 

𝚫𝐙̃ = 𝐙̃ 𝟏𝚫𝐀𝐧̃ 𝐙̃ 𝟎

Each variable from the above equation has the contributions of volume and relative prices. The properly disaggregation is done 
to isolate the volume effect, and the relative prices effect. 
Remembering from sections 3.2 and 3.3,  

So, we disaggregate the changes in 𝑨̆𝐧 in the contributions of four components: 𝐃𝐩,  𝐃𝐯,  𝐁𝐧
disaggregated in the contribution of 𝐃𝐩, 𝐃𝐯, 𝐝𝐅𝐧
disaggregate that national demand in total and imported final demand, specific for variables expressed in volume. 
Gross output’s volume change is rearranged to capture the volume (𝛖) and relative price contribution (𝛒). If we divide each 
change by total gross output in the initial period (𝑥0), we have the contribution of each factor to total gross output 

𝐯 . As we want to observe the trade pattern of national demand, we

As all the transitional matrix are expressed at commodity-by-sector dimension, the variation of the Market share matrix includes 
its variation sized by all the variables on the model (change on intermediate and final demand, excluded inventories). As this 
matrix does not have an essential economic meaning, its change is not open by national and imported.
