This  paper  estimates  Kaldor-Verdoorn’s  law  (the  long-term  relationship  between 
faster growth of production and growth of productivity) across developed and developing 
countries to evaluate those sectors capable of providing more rapid productivity growth. We 
test empirically this law for countries in different stages of development to understand why 
some developing countries were able to reduce the income gap to developed economies, and 
others were not. This analysis permits an evaluation of the sectors able to boost productivity 
growth  according  to  countries’  income  per  capita  and  give  support  to  industrial  policies

1. Introduction 

One of the most important questions in economic theory is why some developing 
countries were able to reduce the income gap to developed economies and others were not? 
Essentially, to answer this question we have to investigate the reason why growth rates differ 
between countries and regions in different stages of development. In this paper, we adopt a 
Kaldorian approach, which stress the existence of increasing returns to scale in some sectors, 
to  tackle  this  issue.  Sectors  have  different  degrees  of  increasing  returns  according  to 
countries’ development stage, and thus some countries grow faster than others due to their 
sectoral structure of production. Thereby, we estimate Kaldor-Verdoorn’s law (the long-term 
relationship  between  faster  growth  of  production  and  growth  of  productivity)  across 
countries  to  evaluate  those  sectors  capable  of  providing  more  rapid  productivity  growth 
according to countries’ income level. 

Neoclassical  models  (Solow,  1956;  Swan,  1956)  assert  that  once  economies  have 
access to foreign capital and foreign markets, countries’ income gap tends to reduce in the 
long run. Due to the assumption of constant returns to scale (and thus decreasing returns to 
capital), poor countries present higher marginal productivity of capital than the rich ones, 
which brings the notion of unconditional convergence among countries. In these models, 
only technological changes could explain the difference between countries’ long-run growth 
rates. However, once they  treat the determinants of technological changes as exogenous, 
neoclassical models did not provide enough contribution to explain the differences in growth 
rates between countries, as well as why countries’ income has not converged (McCombie, 
2006). 

In the late 1980s, Romer (1986, 1990) and Lucas (1988) criticized these “old” growth 
models arguing against the constant returns to scale assumption. This critique was the basis 
for  the  “new”  growth  models,  which  assumes  that  productivity  growth  is  determined 
endogenously2.  This  assumption  has  shifted  the  focus  of  the  neoclassical  models  from 
exogenous  technological  changes  to  the  externalities  generated  by  the  process  of  capital 
accumulation.  Consequently,  in  contrast  to  "old"  generation  models,  the  “new”  growth 
models  might  explain  the  historical  divergence  in  countries’  income.  In  a  more  complex 
model,  Barro  &  Sala-i-Martin  (1997)  develop  the  idea  of  conditional  convergence 
combining  endogenous  growth  models  with  the  notion  of  imitation.  In  this  model,  the 
relatively low costs of imitation enable developing economies to grow faster than developed 
economies. However, in the long run, all economies grow at the rate of discovery, and thus 
the rate of discovery plays the same role in this model as exogenous rate of technical change 
plays in neoclassical model.  

Although these changes have been essential to bring the countries’ growth back to 
debate  in  mainstream  economics,  the  “new”  growth  models  have  provided  limited 
contributions to the knowledge about the relations between economic growth and sectoral 
structure. According to Palma (2007), in spite of being activity-specific, these models are 
sector-indifferent.  Essentially,  countries’  growth  rates  are  explained  by  the  existence  of 
increasing returns on activities, such as R&D, but it is not associated with the size of one 
specific sector3. Furthermore, according to McCombie (2002) and Dutt (2006), endogenous 

                                                 
2 There are two basic types of “endogenous growth  models”. The AK  models (Romer, 1986) consider that 
capital is not subject to diminishing returns, and so shocks are able to modify the growth rate in the steady 
state.  The  Schumpeterian  models  (Lucas,  1988;  Romer,  1990)  consider  that  production  stimulates  other 
activities,  such  as  R&D,  which  present  increasing  returns  to  scale.  Barro  &  Sala-i-Martin  (1995)  present  a 
detailed review of these models. 
3  Only  in  the  last  few  years,  some  studies  based  on  the  neoclassical  growth  approach  have  focused  on  the 
sectoral composition of production to explain countries’ growth rates differences. Rodrick (2013) argues that 
the  neoclassical  model’s  convergence  does  not  occurs  for  the  economy  as  a  whole,  but  in  manufacturing. 
According  to  him,  manufacturing  industries  can  be  rapidly  be  integrated  into  global  production  networks, 
facilitating  technology  transfer  and  absorption  (even  when  they  produce  only  for  domestic  markets).

growth theory, besides ignoring the role played by different sectors in the economy, neglect 
the importance of factors determining the growth of demand. Consequently, they have to 
consider the output elasticity of capital to be exactly equal to unity; otherwise, the model 
predicts ever-increasing growth rates. 

In contrast to neoclassical and “new” growth models, many heterodox economists, 
such  as  Hirschman,  Prebisch  and  Kaldor,  have  attempted  for  the  importance  of  sectoral 
structure  of  production  on  explaining  the  differences  between  countries’  growth  rates. 
Kaldor  (1966)  emphasised  three  reasons  why  manufacturing  growth  might  explain 
countries’ growth rate differences. He argued this sector is important because a faster growth 
of  manufacturing  (1)  boosts  the  growth  rate  of  GDP,  (2)  promotes  a  faster  growth  of 
productivity of the sector itself (owing to static and dynamic increasing returns to scale), and 
(3)  stimulates  the  transfer  of  labour  from  primary  sectors  (which  presents  diminishing 
returns) to manufacturing. These relations between manufacturing and growth are known as 
Kaldor’s laws4. 

In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  his  second  explanation,  which  is  knew  as  Kaldor-
Verdoorn’s law5. Essentially, this law states that the faster the growth rate of manufacturing, 
the faster  will be the  growth rate of labour productivity, because manufacturing presents 
static  and  dynamic  increasing  returns  to  scale.  The  rationale  behind  the  existence  of 
increasing returns is that technological progress is not exogenously given, but induced by 
output  growth6.  This  statement  is  on  the  heart  of  the  cumulative  causation  models.  As 
production grows due to the increase of the extent of markets, the scope for specialisation 
increases, and it stimulates the growth of productivity (due to division of labour). Thereby, 
in  circular  process  that  involves  both  the  supply  and  demand  sides,  productivity  growth 
increases  output  via  market  extension,  which  stimulates  the  productivity  growth 
(McCombie, 2002). 

Although  Kaldor  (1966)  argued  that  UK,  a  developed  economy,  was  de-
industrializing  because  it  suffers  from  “premature  maturity”,  which  has  exhausted  its 
potential  for  fast  growth,  the  author  extend  his  argument  for  countries  in  early  stages  of 
development. Nevertheless, the extension of his argument depends on the consideration that 
different industries inside manufacturing, such as capital goods, might have different degrees 
of  increasing  returns  according  to  countries’  stage  of  development.  Because  individual 
industries  take  different  advantages  of  production  and  demand  factors,  such  as  market 
extension,  skilled  labour  and  innovation,  we  cannot  expect  in  these  industries  the  same 
degree of increasing returns in countries in different stages of development. Based on this 
assumption,  we  analyse  the  sectors  in  terms  of  their  dynamic  increasing  returns  to  scale 
(Kaldor-Verdoorn’s law) across countries controlling for their income per capita. We seek 
to identify those sectors that present higher degree of increasing returns and thus which are 
able to boost economic growth both for developing and developed countries. This analysis 
aims to demonstrate the importance of the sectoral structure to productivity growth and thus 
to economic growth in the long run. 

the  existence  of 

Several  studies  have  analysed 

increasing  returns  across 
manufacturing  sectors,  for  example:  McCombie  &  Ridden  (1984),  McCombie  (1985), 
Bernat  (1996),  Leon-Ledesma  (2000),  McCombie,  Pugno  &  Soro  (2002),  and  Angeriz, 
                                                 
Consequently, the lack of convergence between poor and rich countries is due to specific circumstances that 
influence the speed of structural reallocation to industrial sectors. 
4 A good systematization and discussion of the Kaldor’s laws can be found in Thirlwall (1983) and McCombie 
(1983). 
5 Verdoorn (1949) have emphasised it before Kaldor and showed such empirical relation for a cross-section of 
countries. However, Kaldor (1966) brings this relation back to the debate. 
6  The  “new  economic  geography”  (Krugman,  1991;  1998)  provides  the  micro-foundation  for  Kaldor’s 
aggregate approach. The author stresses the importance of Marshallian sources of external economies, such as 
market-size effects (backward and forward linkages), a thick local labour market, especially for specialized 
skills, and information spillovers.

McCombie & Roberts (2009). Essentially, they found evidence of high increasing returns to 
scale in the industry level, especially when the specification attempts for dynamic increasing 
returns. However, they considered a specific country or a group of selected countries (usually 
developed countries), e.g., states of the USA or regions of the European Union, and thus we 
cannot infer any conclusion about the importance of these sectors according to countries’ 
stages of development. Although we use these studies for the purposes of comparison, the 
aim  of  this  paper  is  to  analyse  the  degree  of  increasing  return  for  both  developed  and 
developing countries in the industry level. Therefore, we estimate Kaldor-Verdoorn’s law 
across a range of countries, including those with high-income levels and those with low and 
middle-income levels in order to contrast them, and, consequently provide an explanation 
for the convergence (or divergence) across countries based on sectoral specialisation. 

The  main  results  are  that  low-tech  manufacturing  sectors  and  consumption  goods 
present  high  degree  of  increasing  returns  for  low-income  countries,  and  low  increasing 
returns for middle- and high-income countries. On the other hand, high-tech manufacturing 
sectors and capital goods present low increasing returns for low-income countries, and high 
increasing  returns  for  middle-  and  high-income  countries.  Furthermore,  natural  resource 
manufacturing sectors do not present significant variation in the degree of increasing returns 
according to countries’ stage of development. 

These findings can explain why some developing countries were able to reduce the 
income  gap  by  promoting  structural  changes,  and  many  others  were  unable  to  promote 
sustainable high growth rates. According to the results, countries have to stimulate low-tech 
manufacturing sectors and consumption goods in the early stages of development, and move 
to high-tech manufacturing sectors and capital goods in the later stages (between US$ 5,000 
and US$ 10,000 per capita). 

This paper is organised as follow. The next section presents methods and data used 
for  estimation.  Section  III  presents  the  results  and  the  robustness  checks.  Section  IV 
discusses the consequence of this paper’s findings for the Kaldorian literature and provides 
the concluding remarks. 

 

2. Methods and data 
 
2.1. Estimation methods: supply- and demand-side specifications 

The  Kaldor-Verdoorn’s  law  is  the  relationship  between  productivity  growth  and 
output growth. Thus, in principle, the estimation of this law should be obtained by a simple 
regression of these two variables: 
 

݌ = ߣ + ܾ ݍ          (2.1) 

 
where ݌ is the productivity growth, ݍ is the output growth, ߣ is the rate of technical progress 
and ܾ is the Verdoorn’s coefficient. 

Many estimations of Kaldor-Verdoorn’s law were based on this equation and found 
a statistically significant value for ܾ different from zero, suggesting that a faster growth of 
output  is  positively  related  to  a  faster  growth  of  productivity7.  However,  according  to 
McCombie (1985) and McCombie & Ridden (1984), the specification of Verdoorn’s law 
must  account  for  the  fact  that  growth  is  essentially  demand  and  not  supply  constrained. 
Hence, the simple regression presented in 2.1 is unable to estimate correctly the degree of 
increasing returns once growth of capital is endogenous to the model and it is a function of 

                                                 
7 McCombie, Pugno & Soro (2002) presents a review of the many of these estimations.

output  growth,  and  thus  this  estimation  is  not  consistent,  once  it  is  only  a  spurious 
relationship between these two variables8.  

Because  in  the  long  run  capital  accumulation  is  a  function  of  output  growth,  the 
specification must include controls for the level of physical capital stock. In order to do it, 
however,  we  have  to  make  some  assumptions  about  the  production  functions.  Based  on 
Angeliz, McCombie & Roberts (2008), we assume a Cobb-Douglas function9 for total output 

 

ܳ = ܣ݁ఒܭ௔ܮ(ଵି௔)          (2.2) 

 

where ߣ is the rate of technical progress, ܳ, ܭ, and ܮ are the level of output, capital and 
labour, and ܽ is the production function parameter. 
 
 

We can re-write it in a linearised form taking the logarithm of 2.2: 

ݍ = ߣ + ܽ݇ + (1 − ܽ)݈          (2.3) 

 

where lower cases mean growth rates. 
 
According to Kaldor-Verdoorn’s law, the rate of technical progress is endogenous 
determined.  Although  many  authors  have  emphasised  the  existence  of  induced  technical 
progress, such as Arrow (1962), which stressed the importance of learning-by-doing in the 
firm level, and Young (1928), which focused on increasing returns on the macro level, we 
consider induced technical progress in a Kaldorian line, in which it takes place in the industry 
level. Thus, the rate of technical progress is given by 

 

 

 

ߣ = ߣı + ߨ[ܽ݇ + (1 − ܽ)݈]           (2.4) 

where ߣı is the exogenous technical progress,  and ߨ is the elasticity  of induced technical 
progress in respect to inputs.  
 
 

Replacing (2.4) in (2.3) and re-arranging we have 

ݍ = ߣı + ݒ[ܽ݇ + (1 − ܽ)݈]          (2.5) 

where  ݒ  is  the  degree  of  increasing  returns.  In  this  equation,  the  importance  of  factors 
accumulation for economic growth become explicit. In contrast with equation 2.3, where we 
only can see explicitly the direct impact of factors accumulation on output growth, here we 
can  see  that  accumulation  of  capital  and  labour  increases  output  growth  by  stimulating 
endogenous technical progress if the degree of increasing returns, ݒ, is greater than the unity. 
Subtracting ݒݍ from both sides, rearranging and defining the total factor productivity 
growth  as  the  difference  between  output  growth  and  the  weighted  growth  of  labour  and 
capital, ݐ݂݌ = ݍ − ܽ݇ − (1 − ܽ)݈, we can re-specify equation (2.5) as 

 

ݐ݂݌ = ఒഥ

௩ + (1 − ଵ

௩)ݍ          (2.6). 

 
The aim of this study is to obtain the degree of increasing returns, ݒ, however, we 
have  to  estimate  first  the  ݐ݂݌.  Following  Angeliz,  McCombie  &  Roberts  (2008)  we  can 
estimate it considering ܽ as the contribution of capital for the total output, and 1 − ܽ as the 

                                                 
8 Under the assumption of constant capital-output ratio in the long run, a stylised fact showed by Kaldor (1961), 
Kaldor-Verdoorn’s law can be reduced to equation 2.1. However, we do not assume it in this paper, because 
short-term variations in capital-output ratio can affect the estimation of Verdoorn’s coefficient. 
9 There is  no need to assume  a Cobb-Douglas  function. However, it  is one of the simple  ways to estimate 
Kaldor-Verdoorn’s law, once we can obtain a linearised form only taking the logarithm of the function.

contribution  of  wages  for  the  total  output,  which  is  given  by  the  wage  share,  and  thus 
calculate ݐ݂݌ based on this: 
 

 
where = 1 − ௐ
ொ

ݐ݂݌ = ݍ − ܽ݇ − (1 − ܽ)݈           (2.7) 

 . 

Another possible way of obtaining ݐ݂݌ is to estimate it as a residual. Rearranging its 

original equation as following  

 

݌ = ܽ(݇ − ݈) + ݐ݂݌          (2.8) 

 

where ݌ = ݍ − ݈ is the labour productivity growth, we obtain an alternative estimation. This 
method, however, is based on the assumption that ݇ − ݈ is exogenous in relation to ݌, which 
is a strong assumption, as the accumulation of capital is related to the market extend and it 
is related to productivity growth. 

After estimating the ݐ݂݌ we can finally regress it in ݍ, as suggested by equation (2.6), 
to obtain the degree of increasing returns to scale (and the Verdoorn’s coefficient). This two-
step methodology is important because it considers that output growth is exogenous to the 
growth of total factor productivity. It implies that demand factors are the main driven of 
accumulation process. 

Alternatively, in order to obtain ݒ we can define ݐ݂݅ = ܽ݇ + (1 − ܽ)݈ as the total 

factor inputs, and estimate it from  

 

ݍ = ߣı + ݒ ݐ݂݅          (2.9)10. 

 
 
The difference between (2.6) and (2.9) is that in (2.9) the growth of production factors 
(inputs)  is  considered  to  be  exogenous,  so  it  is  the  supply-side  specification  of  Kaldor-
Verdoorn’s law, whilst in (2.6) output growth is the exogenous variable, which characterises 
the demand-side specification of Kaldor-Verdoorn’s law11. 
 
 2.2. Human capital augmented specification 
 
As we are estimating this law for countries in different stages of development, it is 
important  to  consider  that  human  capital  stocks  differ  significantly  across  countries. 
Mankiw, Romer & Weil (1992), for  example, show that Solow’s model augmented with 
human capital can explain more precisely countries’ growth path during the post-war period. 
Therefore, in order to consider that labour differs among countries, our specification needs 
to control for each country’s human capital stock. 

Assuming a Cobb-Douglas function for total output as (2.10) instead of (2.2) 
 

ܳ = ܣ݁ఒܭ௔(ܪ)(ଵି௔)          (2.10) 

 

where ܪ is the stock of human capital. Defining ݐ݂݌ = ݍ − ܽ݇ − (1 − ܽ)ℎ as the total factor 
productivity growth, and also that the rate of technical progress is endogenous determined 
by (2.11) instead of (2.4) 
 
                                                 
10  In  the  original  paper,  Angeriz,  McCombie  &  Roberts  (2009),  it  is  specified  as  ݐ݂݌ = ߣı + (ݒ − 1)ݐ݂݅. 
However, it does not change the estimation of ݒ. 
11 Rowthorn (1975a, 1975b) and Kaldor (1975) discuss the implication of each specification to estimate Kaldor-
Verdoorn’s law. Angeriz, McCombie & Roberts (2008) present a systematization of this debate, testing both 
specifications.  They  conclude  that  only  the  degree  of  increasing  returns  estimated  by  the  demand-side 
specification is significantly different from the unity. 

6 

 

ߣ = ߣı + ߨ[ܽ݇ + (1 − ܽ)ℎ]           (2.11), 

 
we can re-specify equation (2.7) as 

 

ݐ݂݌ =  ݍ − ܽ݇ − (1 − ܽ)ℎ           (2.12), 

 

and then proceed exactly as before, estimating (2.6) or (2.9). 
 
2.3. Macro and micro increasing returns 

In  order  to  estimate  Kaldor-Verdoorn’s  law,  it  is  also  important  to  consider  that 
economic  growth  may  affect  individual  industries,  and  thus  Kaldor-Verdoorn’s  law 
specification should control for the existence of macro increasing returns to scale.  Based on 
McCombie (2002), we can estimate micro and macro increasing returns as follow. 

Assuming a Cobb-Douglas function for total output as (2.13) instead of (2.2) 

ܳ௝ = ܣ݁ఒೕܭ௝

௔ೕܮ௝

 

(ଵି௔ೕ)ܳకೕ          (2.13) 

 

where ݆ refers to the analysed sector, and ߦ is the degree of macro increasing returns. 

The growth rate of this sector output is given, thus, by  

 

ݍ௝ = ߣı௝ + ݒ௝[ܽ௝݇௝ + ൫1 − ܽ௝൯݈௝] + ߦ௝ݍ          (2.14) 

 

where ݒ is the degree of micro increasing returns. 

Defining ݐ݂݌௝ = ݍ௝ − ܽ௝݇௝ − (1 − ܽ௝)݈௝ as the total factor productivity growth, we 

can respecify equation (2.5) as 

 

 ݐ݂݌௝ = ఒഥೕ
௩ೕ

+ (1 − ଵ
௩ೕ

)ݍ௝ + కೕ
௩ೕ
 

ݍ௝          (2.15), 

and we can define ݐ݂݅௝ = ܽ௝݇௝ + (1 − ܽ௝)݈௝ as the total factor inputs, re-specifying equation 
(2.9) as 
 

ݍ = ߣı௝ + ݒ௝ ݐ݂݅௝ + ߦ௝ݍ          (2.16). 

 

 
Similarly, we can proceed with the same estimations for (2.6) and (2.9) to obtain the 

micro increasing returns from the supply- and demand-side specifications. 
 
2.4. Data and sectoral aggregation 

To estimate Kaldor-Verdoorn’s law we use panel data on the countries considered 
between 1963 and 2009. Data for employees, output, and value added are available in the 
UNIDO  Industrial  Statistics  Database  at  the  2-digit  level  of  the  International  Standard 
Industrial Classification (ISIC), Rev. 3. Data for output and value added, however, are only 
available in nominal prices (US current prices or the various national currencies), and it is 
therefore  necessary  to  deflate  them  before  conducting  the  econometric  tests.  Although 
countries’ price indices by sector should be used to deflate the output data, these indices are 
not available for most of the countries we intend to analyse. Therefore, in the absence of the 
ideal deflator, we replace it with the output, consumption and investment deflators for each 
country. These deflators are available in the Penn World Table (PWT 7.1).  

Another  relevant  issue  is  that  data  on  fixed  capital  stocks  are  not  available.  This 
variable is estimated using data on gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), also available in 
the UNIDO database, across countries and sectors at the ISIC 2-digit level. Following the 
7 

 

approach adopted in Angeliz, McCombie & Roberts (2008), we apply GFCF data, combined 
with approximations of probable average asset lives, to estimate gross fixed capital stocks. 
The main issue with these data, however, is that they are not available for all countries 
in the same years and do not employ a single sectoral division. Therefore, before performing 
the estimates, we analyse each country separately with the aim of identifying which countries 
we will use and which we will discard, as well as the sectoral aggregation. Although data on 
employees, output or value added and gross fixed capital formation are available between 
1963 and 2009 for 38 countries, most of these are developed countries, and thus exclusively 
using these countries will generate a relevant bias. As a result, data on other countries have 
to be analysed (and in some cases estimated) prior to conducting the econometric tests.  

In terms of the sectoral aggregation, we group some sector to make it possible to 
extend the analysis for the longest time series. The groups of sectors we consider here are: 
food, beverages and tobacco products [Food], textiles, wearing apparel and leather products 
[Textiles],  wood,  paper  and  publishing  [Paper],  fuels,  chemicals,  rubber  and  plastic 
[Chemicals],  non-metallic  mineral  products  [Non-metallic],  basic  and  fabricated  metals, 
machinery,  equipment,  office  and  computing  machinery  [Metals],  electrical  machinery, 
communication, medical, precision and optical equipment [Electrical]; motor vehicles and 
other  transport  equipment  [Transport],  and  furniture  and  other  manufacturing  products 
[Others]. 

Finally,  the  sectors  are  grouped  according  to  their  technological  intensity  and 
categories  of  demand  to  determine  which  sectors  have  the  potential  to  guarantee  higher 
growth rates in the long run. According to technological intensity aggregation, we group 
Food,  Paper  and  Non-metallic  as  natural  resource  based  manufacturing  [NR],  Textiles, 
Metals  and  Others  as  low-technology  manufacturing  [LT],  and  Chemical,  Electrical  and 
Transport as high-technology manufacturing [HT]. In terms of categories of demand the first 
group  (NR)  remains  the  same,  and  we  group  Textiles  and  Others  as  consumption  goods 
chains [CG], and Metals, Electrical and Transport as capital goods chains [KG]. Because 
Chemicals cannot be considered neither capital nor consumption goods, we do not classify 
this sector in any of this groups. 

The analysis also uses data for human capital stocks and GDP per capita. Regarding 
human capital stocks, data on the average years of total schooling (for the population aged 
15 and over) are available in Barro & Lee (2012) dataset. Regarding the GDP per capita data, 
we also use the Penn World Table (PWT 7.1). 

 

3. Empirical results 
 
3.1. General results: dynamic increasing returns to scale in the industry level 
We  start  by  estimating  Kaldor-Verdoorn’s  law  for  countries  in  general  (not 
 
controlling for countries’ stage of development). This estimation, as well as all other in this 
paper, is based on two-way fixed effects panel (countries and years)12. The estimated models 
are 
 

ln൫ܶܨܲ௝൯ = ߚ଴ + ߚଵ ln(ܳ௝)     (3.1) 

 
and 
 

ln൫ܶܨܲ௝൯ = ߚ଴ + ߚଵ ln൫ܳ௝൯ + ߚଶ ln (ܩܦܲ݌ܿ)     (3.2). 

 
                                                 
12 Because we are estimating the Verdoorn’s coefficient based on two-way fixed effects panel, we obtain non-
biased estimations for dynamic increasing returns to scale, once it not subject to the spatial aggregation bias 
(McCombie & Roberts, 2007).

The results shows that although some sectors present higher increasing returns than 
others, such as Food, Chemicals and Electrical, we can accept that all manufacturing sub-
sectors present high degree of increasing returns. The lowest results can be seen in Textiles 
(around 1.34) and Non-metallic (around 1.38), whilst the higher results can be seen in Food 
(around  1.76)  and  Chemicals  (around  1.76).  Table  3.1  presents  the  results  for  the  four 
estimation methods. (3.1a) does not consider human capital and it does not control for macro 
increasing  returns,  (3.1b)  considers  human  capital,  but  it  does  not  control  for  macro 
increasing  returns,  (3.2a)  controls  for  macro  increasing  returns,  but  it  does  not  considers 
human  capital,  and  (3.2b)  considers  human  capital  and  it  controls  for  macro  increasing 
returns).

One interesting point about these results is that all sectors in all estimations present 
higher increasing returns than manufacturing (except by Textiles in the fourth estimation). 
This  result  suggests  that  dynamic  increasing  returns  to  scale  tend  to  be  found  in  the 
individual industry level instead of macro level. Most of the other studies find similar results, 
such as Angeriz, McCombie & Roberts (2009). The authors find higher increasing returns 
for all sub-sectors than for manufacturing, with the only exception of Textiles. 
 
3.2. Increasing returns in the industry level according to countries’ GDP per capita 
 
The  existence  of  different  degrees  of  increasing  returns  to  scale  among 
manufacturing sub-sectors for countries in different stages of development provides a good 
support for stimulus to industrial policies that focused on promoting inter-industry structural 
changes.  Thereby,  the  estimation  of  increasing  returns  to  scale  according  to  countries’ 
income by a heterogeneous analysis may bring some important issues for the debate of the 
importance of sectoral structure for countries development. Taking advantage of having a 
dataset  with  countries  in  different  stages  of  development,  we  estimate  the  degree  of 
increasing returns interacting sectoral output and GDP per capita, as follow:

The degrees of increasing returns provided by these estimations are not obtained by 
ߚଵ, such as in 3.1 and 3.2, but they are obtained by ߚଵ + ߚଶ  ln (ܩܦܲ݌ܿ), which means that 
they vary according to countries’ GDP per capita. Hence, rather than one value for the degree 
of increasing returns, we obtain a function.  

As can be seen in Table 3.2, in estimations that does not control the results for the 
existence of macro increasing returns (3.3a and 3.3b), countries’ GDP per capita do not have 
an important impact on the degree of increasing returns. Even though some sectors present 
higher  degree  of  increasing  returns  for  low  level  of  GDP  per  capita  (such  as  Chemical, 
Electrical and Others), there is no sectors that present a positive relation between GDP per 
capita and degree of increasing returns.

However, as shown in the following figures, once we control the estimation of the 
degree of increasing returns in the industry level for the existence of macro increasing returns 
(3.4a  and  3.4b),  the  results  for  some  sectors  change  significantly  as  countries’  GDP  per 
capita increases.

GDP per capita (US$ 2005)

Figure  3.1  presents  the  degree  of  increasing  returns  in  the  industry  level  and  for 
manufacturing for countries according to their GDP per capita level. The data shows that 
some sectors present high degree of increasing returns for low-income countries and low 
increasing returns for medium and high-income countries, such as Textiles. Others sectors, 
such as Metals and Paper, present low increasing returns for low-income countries and high 
increasing returns for high income countries. The figure shows, however, that some sectors 
present high increasing returns independently of the stage of development, such as Electrical, 
Food and Chemicals. Only Non-metallic and Manufacturing present low increasing returns 
independently of the stage of development (around 1.35). 
 
The estimation of degree of increasing returns taking into account that labour is not 
homogenous (controlling for human capital) show very similar results. Figure 3.2 present 
these results and the main difference is that the degree of increasing returns are higher in 
general,  but  specially  in  Food  and  Metal  for  high-income  countries.  Moreover,  Textiles 
present very low degree of increasing returns (close to the unity) for high-income countries, 
which means that this sector has constant returns to scale for developing countries.

3.3. Technologic Intensity 
 
One  of  the  main  sources  of  dynamic  increasing  returns  in  the  industry  level  is 
technological search and knowledge diffusion. According to Fagiolo &  Dosi (2003:239), 
“technological  advances  are  endogenously  generated  through  resource-expansive  search 
undertaken by multiple agents”. Thereby, we can expect higher degree of increasing returns 
in sectors which higher technologic intensity, once expenses in research and technological 
diffusion are the main drivers of productivity  growth in these sectors. Moreover, we can 
expect higher degree of increasing returns as countries’ GDP increases, once the level of 
GDP per capita is strictly related to expenditures in R&D and innovation activities. 

In order to evaluate the degree of increasing returns among sectors with different 
technologic  intensity,  we  aggregate  the  sectors  in  three  groups:  natural  resource  based 
manufacturing [NR], low technologic intensity sectors [LT] and high technologic intensity 
sectors  [HT].  The  same  methodology  used  in  section  3.2,  which  estimate  the  degree  of 
11 

 

dynamic  increasing  returns  according  to  countries’  GDP  level  (controlling  for  macro 
increasing returns), is applied and we obtain the following results:

GDP per capita (US$ 2005)

 

 
The results show that for low levels of income (lower than US$ 7,500 per capita), 
low technological sectors present higher degree of dynamic increasing returns, but as GDP 
per capita increases the degree of increasing returns fall, which means that specialization in 
this sectors increases the productivity of the sector itself only for low income countries. In 
contrast, for middle and high level countries the high technologic sectors are those capable 
to boost productivity  growth as they present higher degree of increasing returns. Natural 
resource  based  sectors,  such  as  food  and  non-minerals,  present  a  relevant  degree  of 
increasing returns, but it does not change if countries’ GDP per capita increases. 

Controlling for human capital the main results do not change substantially, as can be 

seen from Figure 3.4. 
 
The main difference between the results controlling for human capital is that natural 
resource based sectors present low degree of dynamic increasing returns for low income 
countries, which means that the specialization in this sectors do not increase the productivity 
due to output growth. The results also show that if the countries’ GDP per capita is higher 
than US$ 10,000, they have to promote high-tech sectors to boost productivity growth, once 
these sectors present higher degree of increasing returns as countries achieve a higher level 
of development.

3.4. Categories of demand 
 
An alternative approach that we can adopt to understand the origin of the difference 
of the degree of dynamic increasing returns is based on the categories of demand. The capital 
goods  sectors,  when  associated  to  users,  are  responsible  for  most  of  innovations  in  the 
economy,  and  they  are  central  in  the  process  of  technologic  diffusion  (Lundvall,  1988). 
Thereby, one can argue that productivity growth in capital goods sectors is driven by the 
increase of production in this sector itself when it is associated to users, whilst the increase 
of  productivity  in  consumption  goods  it  is  driven  by  the  increase  of  production  in  other 
sectors in the economy. 
 
Furthermore, as stressed by Kaldor (1966, 1967), capital investment is an important 
source  of  demand  for  countries  in  the  most  advanced  stages  of  development,  because 
manufacturing  generates  demand  for  its  own  products.  He  argues  that  countries  have  to 
promote the import-substitution and exports of capital goods, because this sector will provide 
the goods on which capital expenditure is spent. Thus, the very establishment of a capital 
goods sector is an important source of increasing returns to scale from the demand side. 
Productivity growth will extend this sector’s market size, and thus this sector will display a 
self-generating  demand  for  capital  goods,  which  is  a  central  element  of  cumulative 
causation. On the other hand, if this sector is not internalised, although increases on output 
can increase productivity, it will not be able to promote an increase on its market, which will 
be a constraint for the continuity of a cumulative process13. 

In  order  to  estimate  the  degree  of  dynamic  increasing  returns  in  these  groups  we 
aggregate  sectors  into  three  categories:  natural  resource  based  manufacturing  [NR], 
consumption goods chains [CG] and capital goods chains [KG]. We estimate it based on the 

                                                 
13 Based on this fact, Kaldor (1966, 1967) define the four stages of development: first, a country has to promote 
import-substitution  of  consumption  goods,  second,  promote  exports  of  these  goods,  third,  promote  import-
substitution of capital goods, and, finally, in the most advanced stage, promote exports of capital goods.

The results shows that production of consumption goods can boost the productivity 
 
of the sector itself only for low income countries, whilst the production of capital goods is 
an important source of dynamic increasing returns for middle and high income countries.

When we control the estimation for the accumulation of human capital, results are 

Thereby,  an  increase  of  production  for  low-income  countries  increases  the 
productivity if the countries are specialized in consumption goods. However, as GDP per 
capita increases, specialization in consumption goods are not able to boost productivity any 
more.  Countries  have  to  specialize  in  the  production  of  capital  goods,  instead.  Natural 
resource based sectors present a relevant degree of increasing returns (around 1.4), but it 
does not present variation as countries’ GDP per capita increases. 
 
very similar to those presented before, as presented in Figure 3.6. 
Although the specialization in consumption goods is an important source of dynamic 
 
increasing returns for low-income countries, as GDP per capita increases, countries have to 
specialize in capital goods to take advantage of higher degrees of dynamic increasing returns. 
Again,  the  main  difference  is  that  natural  resource  based  manufacturing  present  low 
increasing returns for low-income countries, but it increases as countries’ GDP increases, 
although  it  is  significantly  lower  than  high  tech  sectors  for  middle  and  high-income 
countries. 
 
4. Concluding remarks 
 
There  is  an  important  debate  on  economic  theory  about  why  some  developing 
countries were able to achieve sustainable high growth rates and their income per capita have 
converged towards developed ones, and why others were not. This paper tried to assess this 
issue from a Kaldorian approach, which stress the importance of increasing returns to scale 
in  some  sectors.  More  specifically,  we  estimate  these  increasing  returns  according  to 
countries’ stage of development by heterogeneous regressions. 
 
The first result corroborates the findings of previous studies, which have found that 
manufacturing sub-sectors present higher increasing returns than manufacturing. It suggests 
that dynamic increasing returns tends to be found in the industry level instead of macro level. 
Furthermore, we also found that the degree of increasing returns in manufacturing does not 
vary according to countries’ GDP per capita. 

 

In contrast to the findings for manufacturing, the data shows that some sectors, such 
as Textiles, present high degree of increasing returns in the early stages of development, but 
as countries grow the degree of increasing returns become low. Others sectors, however, 
such as Metals and Paper present low increasing returns for countries in the early stages of 
development,  and  high  increasing  returns  for  more  developed  economies.  Finally,  some 
sectors present high increasing returns independently of the stage of development, such as 
Electrical,  Food  and  Chemicals,  and  only  Non-metallic  has  low  increasing  returns 
independently of the stage of development. 

When  we  aggregate  sectors  according  to  technologic  intensity  and  categories  of 
demand we find that countries in the early stages of development benefits from specializing 
in  low-tech  manufacturing  and  consumption  goods  because  they  present  high  degree  of 
increasing returns for low-income countries and low increasing returns for medium and high-
income countries. However, as countries reach higher stages of development, it is important 
to  promote  structural  changes  in  favour  of  high-tech  manufacturing  sectors  and  capital 
goods.  These  sectors  present  low  increasing  returns  for  low-income  countries  and  high 
increasing  returns  for  high-income  countries  and  thus  they  can  boost  the  growth  rate  of 
countries  in  higher  stages  of  development.  These  findings  can  explain  why  industrial 
policies,  which  promotes  changes  from  low-tech  manufacturing  and  consumption  goods 
production to high-tech manufacturing and capital goods sectors, are important to reduce the 
income gap.
