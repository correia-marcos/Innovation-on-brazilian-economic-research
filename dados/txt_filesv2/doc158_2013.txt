ABSTRACT 

Numerous  non-profit  organizations  that  contribute  to  collective  goods  also  provide 
prestige to their members. Some of these institutions function as prestige clubs, with 
prestige  levels  and  member  contributions  working  as  club  goods  and  membership 
fees,  respectively.  We  investigate  the  endogenous  formation  of  prestige  clubs.  We 
show that the competitive equilibrium features prestige clubs and that competing club 
managers engage in a futile race for institutional aggrandizement. The competition, 
however,  yields  coordination  benefits  produced  by  internalization  of  positive  and 
negative externalities within clubs. The competitive equilibrium is inefficient because 
clubs neglect external benefits and costs associated with their members’ contributions. 
 

RESUMO 

Numerosas  organizações  que  produzem  bens  coletivos  também  geram  prestigio  aos 
seus associados. Algumas destas organizações funcionam como clubes de prestigio, 
com os níveis de prestigio e contribuições de seus associados funcionando como bens 
de clube e taxas de associados, respectivamente. Investigamos a formação endógena 
de clubes de prestigio. Demonstramos que o equilíbrio competitivo apresenta clubes 
de prestigio e que os gerentes destes clubes se engajam em uma competição fútil para 
aumentar  o  status  da  instituição.  A  competição,  entretanto,  gera  benefícios  de 
coordenação  produzidos  por  internalização  de  externalidades  positivas  e  negativas 
dentro dos clubes. A ineficiência do equilíbrio competitivo se deve ao fato de que os 
clubes ignoram os benefícios e custos externos relacionados as contribuições de seus 
associados.

Introduction 

I. 
Numerous  non-profit  organizations  that  contribute  to  one  or  more  collective  goods 
also  provide  prestige  to  their  members  or  affiliates.  Several  charities  group  their 
members into multiple prestige categories and publicize their members’ contributions. 
Other good examples are orchestras, public radios, schools, universities and various 
religious organizations. 

The prestige level enjoyed by a contributor may be a function of personal and 
institutional  components.  At  the  personal  level,  an  individual  may  obtain  prestige 
when her contribution is compared with other individual contributions; namely, it may 
depend on how important her contribution is relative to the contribution of others. At 
the  institutional  level,  an  individual  may  derive  prestige  by  associating  with  a 
prestigious  organization.  Members  of  the  same  organization  may  obtain  equivalent 
prestige levels if they are grouped in the same category of contributors or belong to 
the same team of contributors (e.g., a department in a given university) or may obtain 
different  prestige  levels  if  they  are  grouped  in  different  categories  or  teams.  The 
prestige level enjoyed by the institution may also depend on how important it is its 
overall  contribution  to  the  collective  good  relative  to  the  contributions  of  peer 
organizations. A student enjoys prestige for his own accomplishments in exams and 
also from the status enjoyed by his school, and the school’s ranking may in part be 
determined  by  its  relative  importance  in  producing  collective  goods  such  as 
knowledge  and  civil  skills.  A  scholar  earns  prestige  for  her  distinguished  research 
output  but  also  for  her  affiliation  with  a  reputable  university,  and  the  latter’s 
reputation  is  in  part  a  function  of  its  relative  contribution  to  the  production  and 
dissemination  of  scientific  knowledge.  A  philanthropist  enjoys  prestige  for  the 
importance  of  his  contribution  relative  to  the  contribution  of  others  to  a  charitable 
cause,  such  as  poverty  alleviation,  but  also  because  of  the  relative  standing  of  the 
charity of which he is a member, and the prestige enjoyed by the charity is partly due 
to its relative contribution to the charitable cause. 

Organizations  that  promote  prestige  for  their  members  seem  to  function  as 
competitive prestige clubs. They compete for members who demand prestige services 
and  they  compete  among  themselves  to  advance  their  own  prestige  levels.  The 
prestige levels offered to members of such institutions have, in many instances, the 
key characteristics of club goods, since members are often grouped into excludable 
prestige categories of limited size. The contributions of members who enjoy identical 
prestige  levels  also  tend  to  be  identical.  Charities  that  supply  multiple  prestige 
categories  provide  a  good  example.  Charity  members  who  belong  to  a  particular 
prestige category often contribute identical amounts and enjoy the same prestige level. 
In  this  paper,  we  build  a  simple  model  to  investigate  the  incentives  for  the 
formation of competitive prestige clubs and examine their key behavioral features. In 
our  economy,  there  are  two  types  of  consumers  who  enjoy  the  benefits  of  the 
provision of a collective good and the consumption of a composite private good, the 
economy’s numeraire good. One type of consumer also derives utility from prestige, 
and  prestige  can  be  produced  from  individual  and  institutional  contributions  to  the 
collective good. The individual component of prestige produced by one’s contribution 
is modeled as the difference between the individual contribution and the economy’s 
average of individual contributions. Similarly, the institutional component of prestige 

 

1 

produced by one’s club is modeled as the difference between the club’s contribution 
amount and the economy’s average of club contributions. 

As  in  a  standard  public  good’s  model,  an  individual’s  contribution  to  the 
collective  good  benefits  every  other  individual  in  the  economy  because  everyone 
derives  positive  utility  from  consumption  of  the  collective  good.  Unlike  a  standard 
public good’s model, the contribution made by an individual or a club increases the 
individual  or  institutional  average  contribution  level  and  this  results  in  a  loss  of 
prestige  for  each  prestige  lover.  In  our  model,  therefore,  there  are  positive  and 
negative  effects  associated  with  expansions  in  one’s  contribution  to  the  collective 
good. 

Prestige  clubs  are  formed  in  an  attempt  to  promote  the  collective  good  and 
prestige levels for their members by internalizing positive and negative externalities 
associated with expansions in contributions and by supplying prestige lovers with an 
institutional  prestige  component.  Prestige  clubs  compete  for  members  and  among 
themselves.  As  a  result,  each  club  attempts  to  maximize  the  utility  of  its 
representative member. 

We show that prestige clubs emerge in the competitive equilibrium. Each club 
internalizes  positive  and  negative  externalities  associated  with  its  members’ 
contributions to the collective good, but neglects the positive and negative effects of 
its members’ contributions on other individuals in the economy. The internalization of 
externalities within clubs generate coordination benefits and such benefits produce an 
increase in the overall provision level of the collective good relative to the level one 
would observe in an economy without prestige clubs. Each club’s membership size is 
limited by increasing crowding costs. The optimal membership size is the level that 
maximizes  a  club’s  contribution  to  the  collective  good,  given  the  individual 
contribution made by each of its members. We also show that the race for institutional 
aggrandizement  is  futile  because  clubs  are  identical  in  equilibrium.  They  make 
identical contributions to the collective good and thus enjoy no institutional prestige. 

We also show that the competitive equilibrium is inefficient because prestige 
clubs do not fully internalize positive and negative externalities associated with their 
members’  contributions  to  the  collective  good  and  because  prestige  clubs  are  of 
inefficient size. The efficient size is either zero, in which case the economy should not 
have any prestige club at all, or the entire population of prestige lovers, in which case 
the economy should feature one prestige club only. 
 
This  paper  contributes  to  two  strands  of  the  literature,  the  literature  on 
voluntary  contributions  to  impure  public  goods  and  the  literature  on  clubs.  Starting 
with  the  seminal  contribution  by  Cornes  and  Sandler  (1984),  the  literature  on 
voluntary contributions to impure public goods has grown enormously. Noteworthy 
contributions  have  examined  the  comparative  static  properties  of  such  models  (see, 
e.g., Cornes and Sandler (1994)), the roles played by warm glow in alleviating free 
riding incentives and the crowding out between public and private contributions to a 
collective good (see, e.g., Andreoni (1989), Andreoni (1990) and Andreoni and Payne 
(2003)),  the  effects  of  prestige  incentives  on  contributions  to  charities  or  other 
prestigious organizations (see, e.g., Harbaugh (1998a), Harbaugh (1998b) and Glazer 
and  Konrad  (1996))  and  the  effects  of  leadership  giving  in  charitable  funding  (see, 

 

2 

e.g.,  Andreoni  (2006a)).1  Our  paper  contributes  to  this  literature  in  that  it  models 
prestige production as a function of relative individual and group contributions to the 
collective  good,  prestigious  organizations  as  clubs,  and  examines  the  endogenous 
formation of such prestige clubs and some of their key features, 
 
The  literature  on  clubs  is  also  voluminous.  The  seminal  contribution  is 
Buchanan (1965). Of the many issues addressed by this literature, some noteworthy 
ones  are  those  related  to  the  benefits  of  forming  small  groups  (see,  e.g.  Buchanan 
(1965)  and  Berglas  (1976)),  those  related  to  the  existence  of  a  competitive 
equilibrium and the efficiency of such an equilibrium whenever it is shown to exist 
(see,  e.g.,  Ellickson  et  al  (1999),  Ellickson  et  al  (2001),  Hammond,  Kaneko  and 
Wooders (1989), Page and Wooders (2008), Scotchmer (1985a), Scotchmer (1985b), 
Scotchmer (2005), Scotchmer and Wooders (1987), Wooders (1978), Wooders (1980) 
and  Wooders  (1994)),  those  related  to  the  efficiency  of  heterogeneous  vis-à-vis 
homogeneous clubs (see, e.g., Brueckner and Lee (1989) and Sandler and Tschirhart 
(1984)) and those related to the degree of exclusion implemented by clubs (see, e.g. 
Hesley  and  Strange  (1991),  Oakland  (1972),  Silva  and  Kahn  (1993)  and  Silva 
(1997)).2  Our  main  contributions  to  this  literature  are  that:  (i)  we  model  clubs  as 
providers of both club goods and contributions to a nonexcludable and nonrivalrous 
collective  good;  (ii)  we  consider  the  potential  interactions  between  clubs  and 
individual contributors; and (iii) we examine the role that interclub externalities play 
on the efficiency of the competitive equilibrium. 

Basic Model 

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  The  next  section  introduces  the  basic 
model. Section III derives the competitive equilibrium for the economy. Section IV 
describes  the  relevant  Pareto  efficient  allocations  and  compares  them  with  the 
competitive equilibrium in order to illustrate the sources of inefficiency of the latter. 
Section V concludes. 
 
II. 
Consider an economy with two types of individuals, whom we shall refer as “purists” 
and “prestige lovers”. There are  N  consumers of each type, where  N  is large. Purists 
are consumers of type  a  and prestige lovers are consumers of type  l . The populations 
of purists and prestige lovers are indexed by  i , 
 
type of consumer is endowed with 
derive utility from prestige. If a purist  i  consumes 
enjoys  Q   units  of  the  collective  good,  his  utility  is

and 

There are three goods, a numeraire good, a collective good and prestige. Each

prestige lovers in order to distinguish them from the population of purists.

The  prestige  level  enjoyed  by  prestige  lover  i   depends  on  whether  he 
contributes  to  the  collective  good  directly  or  channels  his  contribution  through  an 
intermediary  institution,  a  prestige  club.  If  he  is  an  independent  contributor,  the

incentives promoted by the prestige function to the formation of clubs, we assume that

contribution levels made by prestige clubs. Thus, in an economy with prestige clubs, 
the  prestige  level  enjoyed  by  a  club  member  is  a  function  of  how  large  his 
contribution is relative to the average of individual contributions and how large the 
contribution made by his club is relative to the average of institutional contributions. 
 
III.  Competitive Equilibrium 
We  start  by  considering  a  setting  in  which  the  economy  does  not  feature  prestige 
clubs. The equilibrium in this hypothetical setting is a candidate for the competitive 
                                                 
4  These  properties  are  sufficient  for  the  existence  and  uniqueness  of  equilibrium  in  a  voluntary 
contributions  game  (see,  e.g.,  Bergstrom  et  al  (1986),  Cornes  and  Hartley  (2005)  and  Cornes  and 
Hartley  (2007)).  An  implication  of  the  general  analysis  of  Cornes  and  Hartley  (2005)  is  that  the 
standard  assumed  properties  of  the  component  of  preferences  represented  by  the  function  U are 
sufficient to ensure the existence of a unique equilibrium in a voluntary contributions game without 
prestige clubs, even though prestige lovers have the extra linear term in their utility function. 
 
5 If we assumed that individuals and organization incurred costs of advertising their contributions, as it 
may  seem  natural,  one  could  generate  an  additional  motivation  for  the  formation  of  clubs  if  one 
assumed that the advertising cost function were sub-additive on the number of individual contribution 
levels  advertised.  We  decided  to  neglect  advertising  costs  in  order  to  demonstrate  that  the  key 
characteristics of the prestige function, per se, provide incentives for the formation of clubs. 
   
6  An  example  of  a  cost  function  that  satisfies  all  the  assumptions  is 
.  The 
requirement that the average cost function increases at a nondecreasing rate rules out functions such as

Equation (3) informs us that each prestige lover accounts for the contribution’s pure 
and impure benefits when he decides how much to contribute. The first fraction on the 
left hand side is the pure marginal benefit. This benefit is the prestige lover’s marginal 
rate of substitution between the collective good and the numeraire good. The second 
fraction is the impure marginal benefit. It is his marginal rate of substitution between 
prestige  and  the  numeraire  good.  Each  prestige  lover  ignores  the  negative  prestige 
externality that he imposes on every other prestige lover when he contributes to the 
collective good. Holding all other contributions constant, his contribution raises the 
average level of individual contributions, reducing prestige for each other individual

Since the prestige function informs us that the amount of prestige received by 
any prestige lover may increase if this individual associates with others, prestige clubs 
may form to attract prestige lovers. We assume that the population of prestige lovers 
is sufficiently large and that marginal crowding costs rise sufficiently quickly so that 
in the equilibrium candidate the club industry features multiple clubs. 

Let  J  be the number of potential prestige clubs. These clubs are indexed by j , 
.  Each  club  competes  for  members.  Assuming  potential  entry  in  the  club 
j
J
industry,  every  active  club  must  attempt  to  maximize  the  utility  of  a  representative 
member subject to feasibility and sustainability constraints. The feasibility constraint 
is the requirement that the total contribution amount raised by the club is at least as 
large as the total cost of running the club. 

A club is sustainable if it induces individuals to join and provides individual 
and  group  incentives  for  club  members  to  stay.  Since  an  individual’s  decision  of 
whether  or  not  to  join  a  club  is  a  participation  decision  and  the  decision  of  a  club 

                                                 
7  It  is  straightforward  to  show  that  prestige  lovers  enjoy  positive  prestige  levels  in  an  equilibrium 
candidate in which each purist contributes a positive amount to the collective good because the extra 
prestige  benefit  derived  by  prestige  lovers  provide  them  with  an  incentive  to  make  a  larger 
contribution. The prestige level enjoyed by each prestige lover in such a case is (

In  general,  the  participation  and  no-defection  constraints  differ  because  the 
utility level one gets from not joining a club is typically not the same as the utility 
level  one  obtains  from  defecting.  The  utility  of  not  joining  is  the  payoff  an 
independent contributor obtains in a voluntary contributions game in which the other 
players  may  be  independent  contributors  or  members  of  clubs.  The  independent 
contributor  makes  his  contribution  taking  as  given  the  other  players’  choices  of 
whether or not to join clubs and their subsequent contributions. 
To formally derive the utility of not joining a club, let 

−  denote the 
total  amount  contributed  to  the  collective  good  in  the  economy  excluding  the 
contribution made by an independent contributor  i . Let 
 be the (indirect) utility 
level  obtained  by  an  independent  contributor  i .  This  utility  level  is  defined  as

We now examine an individual’s utility level associated with exiting a club. 
Let us suppose that each defector becomes an independent contributor. Among other 
things,  the  utility  of  defection  depends  on  whether  or  not  the  individual  is  the  first 
defector. For the first defector, the utility of defection is the payoff such an individual 
obtains  from  leaving  his  club  and  making  an  independent  contribution,  given  the 
actions of his ex-club members and other contributors, who may be members of other 
clubs  or  independent  contributors.  For  every  other  member  of  a  club  which  has 
already  experienced  defection,  the  utility  of  defection  is  the  payoff  the  individual 
obtains from leaving the club and making an independent contribution, knowing how 
many individuals have already defected, given the actions of his ex-club members, the 
defectors and other contributors, who may be members of other clubs or independent 
contributors. From the second defector on, the optimal defecting strategy is derived in 
an  environment  where  the  defecting  player  knows  how  many  individuals  have 
previously  defected.  The  utility  of  defection  for  each  subsequent  defector  may 
increase or decrease with the number of individuals who have already defected. There 
may be economies or diseconomies of scale in defection. 

To formally derive a club member’s utility of defection, we must first consider 
j   pays  the  same 
z=  for every individual  i  who belongs to club  j . 
 for every member of club  j  because each individual has the 
jp , to each of its 

the  offer  made  by  a  particular  club 
“membership fee,” jz . Hence, 
This implies that 
same income. The club also offers the same amount of “club good,” 
members. The amount of club good supplied is 

j .  Each  member  of  club

The  first  equation  in  (10a)  states  that  the  representative  prestige  club 
determines  its  contribution  level  by  equating  the  sum  of  marginal  group  and 
individual  contribution  benefits,  properly  discounted  by  the  marginal  utility  of 
income,  to  the  marginal  rate  of  transformation  between  contribution  and  the 
numeraire  good.  The  marginal  group  benefits  consist  of  two  components,  the 
marginal  pure  benefits  from  grouping  and  the  marginal  impure  benefits  from 
grouping.  The  marginal  pure  benefits  from  grouping  are  the  sum  of  the  group 
members’ marginal rates of substitution between collective and numeraire goods. The 
marginal impure benefits from grouping are the weighted sum of the group members’ 
marginal rates of substitution between prestige and numeraire goods. The rationale for 
,  comes  from  the  fact  that  a  unit  increase  in  the  contribution 
the  weight,  (
made  by  the  representative  club  member  is  perceived  to  produce  a  net  increase  of 
 units in the prestige level enjoyed by each club member stemming from the 
(
N n N
institutional component of the prestige production function. The marginal individual 
benefit is the net marginal impure benefit associated with an expansion of each club 
member’s  prestige  level  stemming  from  the  individual  component  of  the  prestige 
production function. The club manager knows that an expansion in a club member’s 
contribution  produces  positive  and  negative  effects  on  the  welfare  of  each  club

member.  The  manager  internalizes  the  positive  and  negative  prestige  externalities 
associated with an expansion in each member’s contribution for all individuals who 
belong  to  the  club.  He  neglects,  however,  the  positive  and  negative  prestige 
externalities that are imposed on members of other clubs. 

The bracketed term in the second equation in (10a) represents the perceived 
net effect in prestige production for each unit of contribution made by a club member. 
Consistent with our assumption that either  N  is sufficiently large or crowding costs 
rise  sufficiently  quickly  so  that  multiple  clubs  emerge  in  the  equilibrium  candidate 
(i.e., 

), it is straightforward to show that

since 
. In light of result (10i), one can clearly see that the bracketed term in 
the  second  equation  in  (10a)  is  larger  than  one.  This  implies  that  a  club  manager 
perceives a net increase of more than one unit in the prestige level enjoyed by every 
club member for each unit of contribution made by a club member. 

Equation  (10b)  informs  us  that  the  representative  prestige  club  selects  its 
membership size by equating the club’s marginal benefit of expanding membership to 
its marginal crowding cost. The club’s marginal benefit of expanding membership is 
the contribution collected from each club member. Given the optimal member fee, the 
optimal club size maximizes the club’s contribution to the collective good. 

Equation  (10c)  shows  that  each  club’s  attempt  to  advance  its  institutional 
prestige level is futile. In equilibrium, institutional prestige levels are identically zero 
since  all  clubs  make  identical  contributions  to  the  collective  good.  However,  as 
illustrated  by  equation  (10a),  the  race  for  maximizing  institutional  prestige  yields 
coordination  benefits,  which  induce  each  club  to  expand  its  contribution  level. 
Equation (10d) makes it clear that the formation of prestige clubs has a social cost. 
This  cost  is  measured  in  terms  of  units  of  the  collective  good  that  are  given  up  in 
order to advance prestige. The total social cost is the club industry’s operating cost. 

Equation (10e) is immediately implied by equations (4), (10c) and (10d). Each 
individual’s prestige level is the average of individual contributions, which together 
finance provision of the collective good and the club industry’s operating cost. The 
prestige  level  in  this  equilibrium  candidate  is  higher  than  the  prestige  level  in  the 
previous  equilibrium  candidate  without  prestige  clubs,  since  here  each  individual 
contributes a higher amount to the collective good.9 

We  now  demonstrate  that  the  offer  made  by  a  feasible  representative  club 
satisfies the participation and no-exit constraints (10g). Consider the problem faced by 
an individual  i  who gets the highest payoff from defecting a representative club  j . 
                                                 
9 It is straightforward to demonstrate this. For the sake of comparison, suppose that 
1n = and note that 
1n = is larger than the left hand side of equation (3). Since the 
the left hand side of equation (10a) with 
right hand side of each equation is the same, we reach the conclusion that the individual contribution 
amount  that  satisfies  equation  (3)  is  “too  small”  to  satisfy  equation  (10a)  under  the  hypothesis  that 
1n = . Since 
N n> >  in the interior optimum, one can easily verify that the left hand side of equation 
(10a) is larger than the left hand side of equation (3). This implies that the individual contribution in 
this equilibrium candidate is higher than in the previous one.

This problem is identical to the problem faced by the manager of club  j  if we restrict 
the manager’s set of feasible actions as follows: (i) except for the contribution made 
by individual  i , fix the contribution of every other member; (ii) set club membership 
size  equal  to 
js ;  and  (iii)  set  the  club’s  contribution  equal  to  the  average  of 
contributions made by clubs. Since the maximum of such a problem cannot be larger 
than  the  maximum  of  the  problem  in  which  the  additional  restrictions  are  not 
imposed, we can affirm that the indirect utility level the club manager delivers to each 
club member is at least as large as  M

Now consider the problem faced by an independent contributor  i  who refused 
the club’s offer. This problem is identical to the problem faced by the manager of a 
feasible  representative  club 
j   with  the  additional  restrictions  (i),  (ii)  and  (iii) 
described above, but for 
js = . Thus, the payoff obtained by this contributor cannot be 
1
larger  than  the  utility  level  offered  by  the  feasible  representative  club  in  the 
equilibrium candidate. In sum, a feasible representative club is sustainable because its 
offer satisfies both no-defection and participation constraints.

We  now  derive  the  conditions  for  a  Pareto  efficient  allocation  with  positive  utility 
levels for both types of consumers and compare it with the competitive equilibrium in 
order to highlight the latter’s sources of inefficiencies.

Equation (11j) is the modified Samuelson condition. It equates the marginal 
social benefit of contributing to the collective good to the marginal social of doing so. 
The marginal social benefit is the sum of two components: the pure marginal social 
benefit and the impure marginal social benefit. The pure marginal social benefit is the 
sum of the marginal rates of substitution between collective good and the numeraire 
good. The impure marginal social benefit equals half the marginal rate of substitution 
between  prestige  and  the  numeraire  good.  This  represents  the  increase  in  prestige 
faced by each prestige lover as the collective is expanded. The marginal social cost of 
provision  is  the  marginal  rate  of  transformation  between  contribution  and  the 
numeraire good.

We gather the results in the following proposition: 

 
The  solution  featuring  one  prestige  club  is  a  Pareto  efficient  allocation  if  the 
inequality in expression (12) is reversed. If the left and right hand sides of expression 
(12) are equal, both solutions are Pareto efficient. 
 
Proposition  2.  Whenever  condition  (12)  holds,  a  Pareto  efficient  allocation  with 
positive consumption of numeraire, prestige and collective goods and positive utility 
levels for all consumers is given by equations 
az = , (11a), (11d), (11f) – (11i). 
If  the  reverse  of  condition  (12)  holds,  a  Pareto  efficient  allocation  with  positive 
consumption of numeraire, prestige and collective goods, positive utility levels for all 
consumers is given by  n N=
 
Comparing the conditions that characterize the competitive equilibrium with 
those that characterize any type of Pareto efficient allocation, it is immediately clear 
that the competitive equilibrium is inefficient because it features clubs of inefficient 
size, it yields an inefficient amount of collective good and an inefficient prestige level 
to each prestige lover. Comparing equations (10a) and (11j) reveals that they differ 
with respect to the “weights” placed on both components of the marginal benefit of a 
contribution  to  the  collective  good.  Consider  the  second  equation  in  (10a).  Its  pure 
marginal  benefit  consists  of  the  sum  of  the  marginal  rates  of  substitution  between 
collective  and  numeraire  goods  for  the  members  of  a  representative  club  only.  The 
pure  marginal  social  benefit  in  equation  (11j)  is  the  sum  of  the  marginal  rates  of 
substitution between collective and numeraire goods for all members of society. Since 
the  pure  marginal  benefit  that  the  representative  club  takes  into  account  in  the 
competitive  equilibrium  neglects  the  sum  of  the  marginal  rates  of  substitution 
between collective and numeraire goods for all members of society who do not belong 
to the club, the representative club places a lower weight on the pure marginal benefit 
of a contribution than it is efficient. 

As for the comparison between impure marginal benefits, we can clearly see 
from the bracketed term in the second equation in (10a) that the weight placed by the 
representative club manager on the impure marginal benefit is larger than the efficient 
weight.  In  fact,  as  we  discussed  before,  the  weight  placed  on  the  impure  marginal 
benefit  by  a  club  manager  in  the  competitive  equilibrium  is  larger  than  one.  This 
follows from the fact that the representative club internalizes prestige externalities for 
its own members only. 

As  the  competitive  club  places  a  lower  than  efficient  weight  on  the  pure 
marginal benefit but a higher than efficient weight on the impure marginal benefit, it 
is  unclear  whether  the  competitive  club  industry  undersupplies  or  oversupplies  the 
collective good. The lower than efficient weight on the pure marginal benefit provides 
incentives  for  underprovision.  The  higher  than  efficient  weight  on  the  impure 
marginal benefit, on the other hand, provides incentives for overprovision. Since the 
prestige  level  enjoyed  by  a  prestige  lover  in  either  competitive  equilibrium  or  a 
relevant  Pareto  efficient  allocation  is  an  increasing  function  of  the  overall  level  of 
collective  good  and  since  the  competitive  equilibrium  does  deliver  an  efficient 
amount of collective good, the prestige level supplied by each competitive club is also 
inefficient.

to each of its members, the competitive industry supplies  1800  units of the collective 
good  and  the  utility  level  for  a  representative  club  member  is  38006.6.  Thus,  the 
competitive equilibrium undersupplies the collective and prestige goods and yields a 
much lower utility level to each prestige lover than it is efficient.

V. 
The  incentives  to  promote  the  individual  and  institutional  components  of  prestige 
motivate individuals (managers) to form prestige clubs. The race for advancement of 
both prestige components produces coordination benefits within clubs, even though 
the  race  per  se  is  futile.  The  coordination  benefits  stem  from  internalization  of 
positive and negative prestige externalities within clubs. Such coordination benefits, 
in  turn,  motivate  managers  to  expand  membership  sizes,  but  the  expansions  are 
limited  by  growing  crowding  costs.  Net  of  administrative  costs,  the  prestige  club 
industry produces a greater amount of collective good than one would observe in a 
hypothetical economy without prestige clubs. 

Conclusion 

The competitive equilibrium, however, is inefficient because it features clubs 
of inefficient size and each club does not fully internalize the positive and negative 
externalities associated with its members’ contributions to the collective good. As a 
result,  the  competitive  equilibrium  produces  inefficient  amounts  of  prestige  and 
collective goods.
