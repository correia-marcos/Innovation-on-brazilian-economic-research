Abstract 
This paper studies the main drivers of the level and efficiency of municipal spending in Early Childhood 
across Brazilian municipalities. At the same time that provides an estimate for ECD spending, this analysis 
evidences how redistributive has been the public ECD spending in Brazil and the role of fiscal and political 
variables on the distribution of expenses geared to children across Brazilian municipalities. The study also 
highlights important local features that explain why some municipalities attain better outcomes than other 
using the same amount of resources. The results show that ECD spending is negatively related to income 
inequality,  do  not  confirming  one  of  the  predictions  of  the  median  voter  theory.  Political  and  fiscal 
variables, like spending capacity and revenue volatility have considerable impact on ECD spending. With 
respect the responsiveness to local needs,  ECD spending is higher in the municipalities which presented 
higher illiteracy rates in 2000, suggesting, politicians preferences were linked to the perceived local needs 
for ECD services. In the efficiency analysis, the results show that the municipalities operating in a better 
socioeconomic  environment  (higher  per  capita  income  e  lower  inequality)  can  more  efficiently  allocate 
their resources to early childhood.

1.  Introduction 

 

Investments  geared  towards  Early  Child  Development  (ECD)  should  be  a  priority  policy  in 
developing  countries.  As  pointed  out  by  Heckman  and  Masterov  (2007),  ECD  policies  can  increase 
productivity in the economy and reduce inequality. According to the authors, investing in young children 
who grow up in disadvantaged environment is a rare public policy with no equity-efficiency trade-off. Other 
studies, like Campbell et al. (2008), Berlinski et al. (2009), Burger (2010), Nores and Barnett (2010) and 
Belfield and Kelly (2013), also evidence the impact of early childhood interventions on cognitive skills and 
health outcomes.  

In  Brazil,  since  the  nineties,  indicators  related  to  early  childhood  development  significantly 
improved. The child mortality rate1, for example, decreased, on average, from 46.6 in 1991 to 18.8 in 2010; 
almost all children between 6 and 14 years old were in school in 2010 and the school attendance for children 
up  to  5  years  old  has  significantly  increased.  In  effect,  according  to  Evans  and  Kosec  (2012),  Brazil’s 
government policy over the last 20 years can be broadly characterized as “prochild”, given the new laws 
approved benefiting children2 and the creation of FUNDEF and FUNDEB which increased the education 
revenue in Brazilian Municipalities.  

Given the decentralized structure for offering pre-primary and primary education and basic health 
services,  in  Brazil  municipal  governments  are  the  major  responsible  for  ECD  services  provision.  The 
national government programs benefiting the children represent just a small portion of the services provided 
to  this population. To show this,  in  2012 81% of all enrollments  in  the first to  fifth  grade  are in  public 
schools  are under municipal management3. Moreover, students  up to  10  yeas (daycare, pre-primary and 
first primary) account for 70% of total enrollment in municipal schools. Concerning the public health care 
services, approximately, 92% of all consultations and medical procedures up to age group of ECD were 
managed by municipal governments in 2012. In fact, this increase of the services towards the children is 
reflected in municipal public spending. According to the National Treasury Office (Secretaria do Tesouro 
Nacional), the municipal spending in ECD services rose almost 90% between 2004 and 2012. It is worth 
noting that at the same time that some municipalities present very low mortalities rates other municipalities 
in Alagoas and Maranhão, for example, present child mortality (under 5 year) rate like 50.94 and 49.264. 
Furthermore still in 2010, 76.5% of children between 0 and 3 years old in Brazil were not attending school. 
For families in the lowest decile of household earnings, this rate is 83%. 

This context of increase of ECD spending and the existence of localities and individuals demanding 
additional  effort  from  municipal  governments  in  the  provision  of  more  and  better  services  towards  the 
children motivates new researches to understand how responsive has been ECD spending to inequality and 
local needs across Brazilian municipalities. Despite the theoretical predictions of the median voter theory 
on how large must be redistributive public spending according to local high income inequality, there are 
some empirical studies not supporting the positive relationship between redistributive public spending and 
inequality, like Peroti (1996) and Mello & Tiongson (2006). Assessing whether the differences of ECD 
spending across municipalities reflects the differences on inequalities or not helps to understand how public 
spending is contributing to reduce the differences of interpersonal income inequality in Brazil.      

Moreover, even if the ECD spending is oriented by local needs, the local government programs for 
the children may not attain its goals. Campos (1998) points out that the decentralization process in Brazil 
are subject to several risks, given the unpreparedness of municipal governments in terms of administrative 
capacity, shortage of technical resources, corruption etc. A clear consequence of such unpreparedness is 
the  reduction  of  efficiency  of  public  spending,  including  those  geared  towards  ECD  services.  In  this 
scenario, even with the sophisticated normative basis created in Brazil in the last twenty years for funding 
ECD  spending,  more  resources  to  education  and  health  not  necessarily  would  induce  improvements  for 
children.

Then, besides providing an estimate for ECD spending, this study presents an econometric exercise 
aiming to  know the drivers of ECD spending  across  Brazilian municipalities. This  analysis can provide 
evidences  on  how  redistributive  has  been  the  public  ECD  spending  in  Brazil  and  the  role  of  fiscal  and 
political variables on the distribution of expenses geared to children across Brazilian municipalities. This 
paper also aims to assess the efficiency level of municipal expenditures on ECD services for education and 
health care in Brazil, as well to study the determinants of this efficiency. For the determinants of efficiency 
level, we consider, particularly, factors relating to socioeconomic characteristics, institutional dimension 
and locational issues of Brazilian municipalities. 

In addition to this introduction this paper has six more sections. The following section describes the 
used methodology to calculate ECD spending across Brazilian municipalities. The third section presents 
the methodology to  study  the determinants  of ECD spending, the efficiency analysis of municipal ECD 
spending across Brazilian municipalities  and the investigation of the determinants  of efficiency of ECD 
spending. In the fourth section, the results are discussed. The last section presents some conclusions. 
 

2. An estimate for the municipal ECD spending in Brazil 
 
Estimating public ECD spending in sub-national or national level is a challenging task, mainly due 
to the difficulty to know whether the spending exclusively benefits children or not. The classification of 
Public Spending by Function and Sub-Function indicates which services and goods the government offers, 
but  does  not  enables  evaluating  which  individuals  benefit  from  the  public  spending.  Although  more 
detailed, the Public Spending by program, when it is available, neither provides sufficient information to 
know whether the spending is being targeted to children only. For example, in the spending demonstrations 
of the Federal Government in Brazil, the spending in the Family Health Program (PSF) it is not split by age 
or by social group. According Vargas & Sabatiñes (2010), in Latin America Countries, given the difficulties 
for obtaining data on ECD investments, the usual indicator for ECD spending is just preprimary spending. 
Contributing to bridge this information-gap, this study provides an estimate of ECD public spending 
across Brazilian municipalities, considering the definition for ECD age group children between 0 and 14 
years old. The adopted strategy in this study relies on the assumption that total ECD spending comprises 
relevant actions in Education, Health and Social Assistance sectors. In this study, the public spending on 
ECD  of  Brazilian  municipalities  will  be  estimated  using  data  gathered  from  a  yearly  publication  of  the 
Brazilian  National  Treasury  Office  (STN)  called  Finanças  do  Brasil  or  simply  FINBRA.  This  database 
presents information on annual receipts and expenditures of Brazilian Municipalities. The functions and 
sub-functions  are  the  same  as  the  earlier  considered  and  the  period  will  be  the  same  (2004-2012).  
Specifically, it will be considered the spending data reported in the Functions Education, Health, Social 
Assistance. In Brazil, all municipalities adopt the same classification of public spending by function and 
sub-function. Then there is some basis for comparability across municipalities for the public spending in 
these three areas.  

In  the  Function  Education,  the  sub-function  Pre-primary  (Educação  infantil)  comprises  all 
spending on education of children between 0 and 5 years old. The spending subcategory Primary (Ensino 
fundamental) includes expenses on education of children and adolescents between 6 and 14 years old. In 
the Function Health, the sub-functions Primary Health-Care (Atenção Báscia) and Food and Nutrition 
were considered to calculate the ECD spending. In the sub-function are reported expenses with the Family 
Health Program, as pointed out earlier, an important program for reducing infant mortality rate in Brazil. 
In  the  sub-function  Food  and  Nutrition  it  can  be  include  any  program  that  aims  to  reduce  or  eliminate 
nutritional deficits. The actions may also aim to guide the population about nutritional values of foods, and 
supplement food deficiencies among population or among specific groups such as children at school age, 
nursing mothers and their infants. 

  

In the function Social Assistance, the sub-function Child Assistance (Assistência à Criança) may 
be considered an ECD spending. This sub-function may comprise the actions undertaken to support and 
protect children and adolescents, providing care for the attainment of their basic needs. 

It is worth noting that, the spending reported in the sub-functions Primary Health Care and Food 
and Nutrition are not exclusive for children. In order to estimate the portion of the spending oriented to 

children,  the  expenditure  of  the  sub-function  Primary  Health  Care  will  be  weighted  by  the  share  of 
consultations of children up to fifteen years old5 in the number of consultations of PSF during the period 
2004-2012. This approach captures the fact that the number of consultations of children in the PSF has been 
growing  over  the  years,  and  supposedly  the  resourses  geared  towards  the  population  under  analysis. 
Equation 1 presents how ECD spending will be calculated by municipality in Brazil

function Primary Education of the municipality 𝑖 in the period t; 𝑺𝑨𝒊𝒕 = Public Spending in the sub-function 
Child Assistance of the municipality 𝑖 in the period t. 

To take into account regional prices differences, the ECD spending by municipality will be deflated 
to  2011  using  regional  INPC  price  index.  To  avoid  accounting  inconsistencies  and  due  to  the 
incompatibility of the data of different  sources, some  municipalities were excluded from  the sample.  In 
summary, the main reasons for exclusion were:  We excluded municipalities which presented zero values 
for education and health spending; the municipalities that declared expenditure on education or health care 
higher than total spending were also disregarded; as the estimation of ECD spending involves connections 
of the financial information of municipalities with data on the number of consultations for the ECD age 
group, this process also resulted in a loss of information. The municipalities which presented small number 
of consultations per year, compared to the other similar municipalities were excluded from the sample.   

Table 1 shows the total ECD spending across Brazilian Municipalities between 2004 and 2012. The 
values were deflated and are expressed in 2011 prices. Within these period, ECD spending increased from 
R$ 43.70 billion to R$ 81.75 billion, which represents a growth of 87% in eight years. In spite of this high 
growth rate of ECD spending, the share in the total spending in Brazilian municipalities stays around 24% 
between 2004 and 2012 (see Table 1). It means that other public expenses have also grown in same the 
proportion. Hence, apparently the expansion of municipal ECD spending seems to be just a part of a process 
of public spending raise  rather than  as expansion in  recognition  of the potential contributions  that ECD 
spending growth can bring about.

5 The number of attended patients was gathered in DATASUS database. DATASUS is a data system supported by the Ministry of Health, 
which register information (including age) on the patients collected by all attention health units. The official information about consultations 
is available in nine age group: under 1 year old; between 1 and 4 years old; between 5 and 9 years old; between 10 and 14 years old; between 
15 and 19 years old; between 20 and 39 years old; between 40 and 49 years old; between 50 and 59 years old; above 59 years old.

According  to  Table  1,  spending  on  education  accounts  for  88%  of  total  ECD  spending  in  2012, 
followed  by  health  and  social  assistance  expenditures.  The  data  also  reveal  that,  the  share  of  education 
spending increased 3.4 percentage points within the period. The impact of the FUNDEB in 2007 is visible 
in  this  data.  In  effect,  after  2006  the  share  of  Education  Spending  raised  by  2.2  percentage  points. 
Concomitantly Health spending participation decreased almost 2 percentage points. 

Table  stands for the descriptive statistics of per child ECD spending across municipalities. North 
region presents the smallest average of per child ECD spending (R$ 2,569 per child or US$ 1,167) in Brazil, 
followed by Northeast region (R$ 2,945 per child or US$ 1,339). Both regions present the highest poverty 
rates in Brazil and high income inequality (see Table ). Contrasting with this situation, in the South region, 
where poverty and inequality is low, it is noticed the largest average of per child ECD spending.

These regional differences in ECD spending are depicted Figure 1. The map portrays the per child 
ECD  spending  across  the  considered  Brazilian  municipalities.  In  the  North  region,  a  great  part  of 
municipalities spend less than R$1,969.49 per year in ECD. In the southern municipalities, the frequency 
of municipalities spending more than R$3,848,89 becomes considerably higher.  The kernel density map 
(Figure  1)  shows  where  are  concentrated  the  municipalities  with  the  highest  per  child  ECD  spending, 
considering  the  distance  among  municipalities  and  the  spending  level.  In  the  States  of  São  Paulo,  Rio 

Grande  do  Sul  and  Santa  Catarina  we  can  observe  the  largest  concentration  of  high-ECD  spending 
municipalities. 

3. Methodological approach 

3.1 Determinants of ECD Municipal Spending 

 

The literature on the determinants of public spending grounded on the median voter theorem (see 
Sanz & Velasquez (2002) and Mendes & Sampaio (2006), Rocha et al. (2012)) suggests a number of local 
characteristics to be included as explanatory variables, like population, median income, tax rates and other 
controls. Besides considering all these variables, the responsiveness of ECD spending to local needs for 
ECD provision will be analyzed. The local needs will be represented by outcomes associated to the scarcity 
of ECD services provision6. This approach relies on the hypothesis that marginal utility of public goods is 
decreasing.  Put  differently,  despite  heterogeneity  of  individuals’  preferences,  the  population  would  be 
better off if, for example, mortality rate among children and illiteracy rate are the smallest as possible. The 
diminishing marginal utility hypothesis means that the scarcer are the ECD services, the more preferable 
will be the additional provision ECD related public services. Because these preferences are supposed to be 
shared with politicians, the public ECD expenditures would be larger where the provided ECD services is 
not enough to generate the desirables health and education outcomes. Based on these arguments Skidmore 
and Deller (2008) argues that Public Spending may converge to a common level (absolute convergence) or 
to different levels (conditional convergence). 

Following the adopted approach of Mello and Tiongsnon (2006) to capture the relationship between 
redistributive  government  spending  and  inequality,  the  current  ECD  spending  will  be  explained  by  the 
lagged levels of income inequality represented by the gini coefficient. To capture some non-linearity on the 
relationship between public spending and inequality, as proposed by Bénabou (2000).  

The  political  environment  of  the  municipality  will  be  represented  in  the  model  by  some 
characteristics of the mayor like education level, whether he was reelected or not, political party affiliation 
and whether the municipality receives revenues from agreements with federal and state government. These 
last two variables may suggest to what extent the national and sub-national political alliances would result 
more revenues to the municipality, besides those prevue by law. Variables measuring fiscal decentralization 
of the municipality, like spending capacity, will also be included in the model.  

Three models will be estimated. In the first one, the total per child ECD spending in (in logarithm) 
is the dependent variable. In the second and third models, the estimates will show the determinants of per 
child ECD spending in Education and health. Equation 2 presents the general structure of the models to be 
estimated.

𝐸𝐶𝐷is the average per capita ECD spending, ln N is the local population in 2010, 𝑦𝑖 is the median 
Where 𝑠𝑖
per capita income, gini is the gini coefficient in 2000 of the municipality i. The vector L indicates the local 
needs for ECD spending. In the first equation, the vector L contains the illiteracy rate among 11 to 14 years 
old individuals in 2000, an outcome of the provision of education to children in the municipality; mortality 
rate  among  children  up  to  five  years  old  in  2000  and  poverty  rate  among  children.  For  the  education 
spending equation, L is the illiteracy rate among 11 to 14 years old individuals in 2000 and for the health 
spending equation, L is the mortality rate among children up to five years old in 2000. In all cases, if the 
parameter estimate 𝛾 is positive, thus ECD spending is acting to reduce welfare inequality across Brazilian 
municipalities. If the estimate for this parameter is negative, thus ECD spending may be widening welfare 
inequality, once the municipalities presenting the largest mortality, illiteracy and poverty  rates are those 
who has been spent less in ECD provision.  

                                            
6 The responsiveness of public investment to local needs was studied by Faguet (2004). 

The  variable  𝑋𝑖  is  a  vector  containing  political  and  fiscal  decentralization  variables  and  controls 
which includes variables like age structure of population, demographic density and distance to capital and 
dummies for each State. 

Table 3 stands for the explanatory variables and their sources. The analysis will be carried out using 
the  average  of  estimated  Education  and  Health  ECD  expenditures  between  2007  and  2011  previously 
estimated. Then, the results capture the fact that a given municipality traditionally spends more on ECD 
services.  The  data  on  Education  spending  was  deduced  from  the  FUNDEB  transfers.  Remembering  the 
distribution of the FUNDEB depends on the number of enrolments in Basic Education system. Disregarding 
the  FUNDEB  resources,  the  Education  spending  level  becomes  more  dependent  on  the  municipal 
administration decisions. Some of the explanatory variables are for 2010 (given CENSUS information) and 
2011. Continuous covariates, like spending  capacity, transfers  from  Federal  and State  government were 
also averaged over the period 2007-2011. 

The tree versions of Equation 2 will be estimated using two stage least squares, considering that 
2000 municipal median income is an instrument for 2010 median income. This is because 2010 municipal 
median income may be an endogenous variable, partially determined by public spending. The instrument 
is correlated to 2010 median income, however is not determined by current public spending.

3.2. Efficiency of ECD municipal spending in Brazil 

 

Data  Envelopment  Analysis  (or  DEA)  approach  will  be  used  to  calculate  efficiency  scores  of 
municipal ECD public spending. DEA is as successful approach to calculate efficiency, and, as pointed out 
by Cooper, Seiford and Zhu (2011), DEA method is widely used in various sectors and products in different 
countries.  The  DEA  method,  introduced  by  Charnes,  Cooper  and  Rhodes  (1978),  uses  a  nonparametric 
approach  for calculating  the efficiency frontier. The DEA method measures the relative performance of 
similar Decisions Maker Units (DMU) comparing the ratio between outputs7 and inputs, generating a single 
indicator  of  performance  for  each  DMU.  In  our  work,  the  municipalities  are  defined  as  DMU,  due  to 
municipal government is the main responsible by supply of basic services to ECD. 

The DEA model to be used in this study is an extension of DEA containing an iterative resampling 
process8, known as bootstrap (see Simar and Wilson, 1998, 2000, 2011). This DEA technique minimizes 
the bias in the estimation of the efficiency indicator and allows the construction of confidence intervals for 
the efficiency score, as can be seen in Equation 3. From a K resampling process, the efficiency score for 
∗𝐷𝑀𝑈0 (with 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝐾), in which this score is 
each DMU is calculated K times, providing an estimator 𝜃̂
𝑘
calculated by pseudo observations from bootstrap approach:  𝜃̂∗𝐷𝑀𝑈0 = 𝐾−1 ∑
. Obtained the set 
of bootstrap values, the confidence interval (CI) of the true 𝜃 can be estimated by the empirical distribution 
of the estimates of pseudo efficiency scores, and then the bootstrap approximation for the true CI is given 
by: 

∗𝐷𝑀𝑈0
𝜃̂
𝑘

𝐾
𝑘=1

Pr(𝜃̂𝐷𝑀𝑈0 − 𝛿̂𝐷𝑀𝑈0 ≤ 𝜃𝐷𝑀𝑈0 ≤ 𝜃̂𝐷𝑀𝑈0 + 𝛿̂𝐷𝑀𝑈0) ≈ 1 − 𝛼 

(3) 

 
Where: 𝜃 is the “true” efficiency indicator, 𝜃̂ is an estimate of the efficiency indicator, 𝛿̂ is the margin of 
error estimated by bootstrap process, 𝛼 is the significance level. Based on the confidence interval estimator 
for efficiency 𝐶𝐼[𝜃, (1  − 𝛼)] = 𝜃̂ ± 𝛿̂, obtained using the resampling process, it is possible to calculate a 
robust efficiency index less sensible to outliers in the data. Moreover, it is also possible to find the size of 
the bias of the efficiency estimate: 𝐵𝐼𝐴𝑆𝑘(𝜃̂) = 𝐸(𝜃∗) − 𝜃̂.  

The  Equations  4  and  5  define  the  production  functions  for  education  and  health  services9.  The 
description of the inputs and outputs included in the production function is in Table , where the outputs 
indexed with “𝑎” were inverted (this was done to  maintain the positive relationship between inputs and 
outputs). In all cases, the vector of inputs (𝒙⃗⃗ ) is formed by only one variable, which corresponds to the 
health and education ECD spending per child in average of last five years (2007 to 2011). All data are at 
municipal level. The period of the input variables cover the years 2007 to 2011 and the output variables are 
for 2011. We will use average expenditure on ECD over the years in order to consider the consistency of 
the resources invested in the area, as well as to take into account the fact that the investments do not generate 
immediate effects on ECD outcomes.

Given the heterogeneity  among Brazilian municipalities, we assume that the production function 
 
exhibit variable returns to scale (VRS). VRS enables evaluating the differences between DMUs which have 
great  quantity  of  inputs/outputs  (likely  operating  with  decreasing  returns)  and  DMUs  with  few 
inputs/outputs (operating, e.g., with increasing returns). Furthermore, the efficiency score for each DMU 
has been calculated in an output-orientated perspective. The choice for output-orientated DEA, supposes 
that  municipalities  can  improve  efficiency  obtaining  higher  output  levels  for  a  given  level  of  per  child 

                                            
7 Here, the output term is more generic, because it corresponds also the outcomes variables like learning indicator for education and mortality 
rates for health sector. 
8 We use the package for Frontier Efficiency Analysis with R (FEAR) to calculate the efficiency scores – see more details in Wilson (2008). 
9 The efficiency analysis is carried out considering only health and education ECD spending. Social Assistance spending was excluded because 
more than 1,421 municipalities did not report this type of expenditure or reported zero real (R$ 0.00), and many locations also declared child 
assistance costs close to zero. 

expenditure.  In  an  input-oriented  perspective,  efficiency  would  be  improved,  for  example,  reducing  per 
child ECD spending, for a certain output level. 

The choice of the variables that represent the outputs of the production functions for ECD services 
was based on Vegas & Santibañes (2010), which enhance three key outcomes generated by ECD policies: 
cognitive development, socio emotional development and physical well-being and growth. Table  presents 
the input and outputs to be used in the efficiency analysis. The variables that are included as outputs in the 
educational production function have three dimensions: learning, enrollment and school quality. The first 
dimension is represented, respectively, by language and mathematic scores in Prova Brasil in the fifth grade 
of Primary school. The dimension of pre-primary coverage is composed by the rate of school attendance 
for children between 0 and 5 years old, which indicates the public sector attention with the kindergarten 
and pre-school10. The last educational dimension is formed by proportion of teachers with third degree in 
the pre-primary and elementary school and school infrastructure index, including variables like lab, gym, 
library  and  computers  for  students11.  We  consider  mortality  rates  as  outcomes  in  the  Health  production 
function (see Table  for more details).

10 As shown by Conti, Heckman and Urzua (2010), investments in preprimary education has positive effects on student academic performance 
in  other  stages  of  education,  including  health  benefits  for  individuals.  Therefore,  there  is  no  trade-off  between  the  expansion  of  care  in 
preprimary education and school outcomes in primary education.

𝑍 = 0 otherwise. The index ranges from zero (not exist any resource to aid learning) to one hundred (there are all resources). For SII were 
considered the existence of the following: science lab, computer lab, sports court, special care room, library, reading room  and facilities for 
people with special needs, computers available for students and internet. 
12 The variable rate of underweight children with less 2 years old (weight below the third percentile - lower curve - of the weight curve for 
each specific age) can’t be included in the production function (Equation 3), because this variable had a great number (2,013 observations) of 
missing values.

The  excluded  outliers  are  those  units  located  in  the  area  above  the  average  plus  (or  less)  2.575 
standard deviation of the average health and education spending. Imposing this restriction to the data, the 
number of DMUs used to calculate efficiency on education is 3,977 municipalities, representing about 72% 
of all Brazilian municipalities. In this sample, the annual average of per child ECD expenditure on education 
is R$ 2,158.83. The number of municipalities for evaluating the technical efficiency of health services is 
3,737 units, and the average of per child ECD spending on health (basic attention) is approximately R$ 
259.87. 
  
3.3 Determinants of Efficiency 

 

In  the  econometric  approach  to  be  used  here,  we  consider  variables  related  to  institutional, 
socioeconomic and locational issues of municipalities. As it was seen throughout this study, socioeconomic 
and locational issues influence the provision of services for early childhood. According to Naritomi et al. 
(2012),  the  institutional  dimension,  in  particular,  has  a  prominent  role  in  Brazil,  due  to  the  formal 
components that define the rules of implementation process and financing of the public services, and affect 
the  peculiarities  involved  in  the  definition  of  local  institutions  and  the  distribution  of  political  power.  
Considering  the  data  structure,  that  consists  in  a  cross  section  of  Brazilian  Municipalities,  and  the 
peculiarities  of  dependent  variable  (censored  at  0  and  1),  the  econometric  model  used  was  a  Tobit 
regression. The dependent variable of the model is the efficiency score (unbiased) obtained through DEA-
BCC with 1,000 resampling for the municipal spending used in early childhood development.  

The model equation has the following structure:

The estimates of the coefficients of the main variables of equation 3 are shown in Table . It is also 
shown the standardized coefficients of each model. Due to the spending in education represents almost 80% 
of total ECD spending, the results of the first and last morel are very similar. In general the results for all 
models  suggest  a  U-shaped  relationship  between  per  child  ECD  expenditures  and  population.  Per  child 
ECD spending may be high in small cities, due to the fixed costs of education and health services. As the 
population growths and also the scale of ECD services provision, the per capita expenditures decrease. The 
upward trend for the per capita spending may occur because in the largest cities, education and health are 
more expensive. These results also mean that the smallest and the biggest municipalities have the similar 
per capita ECD spending. The standardized coefficients show that if Population increase by one standard 
deviation, logarithmic of total per child ECD spending would decrease 3.07 standard deviations. According 
to the standardized coefficients, population variables are those who most impact on ECD spending among 
all considered models.

Income  elasticity  for  total  ECD  spending  is  about  0.12,  considering  all  controls  and  the  income 
elasticity  of  education  spending  is  almost  0.4.  The  estimates  also  reveal  that  total  and  Education  ECD 
spending are negatively related to income inequality. If this result really represents a causal relation between 
ECD spending and income inequality, and not only a correlation, the regional differences of ECD spending 
may  be  contributing  to  the  persistence  of  regional  socioeconomic  inequalities  in  Brazil,  instead  of 
narrowing it. Moreover, the estimated parameter for the quadratic gini coefficient reveals other perspective 
for this relationship. The U-shaped relationship suggests that total ECD spending is negatively related to 
inequality up to the turning point the curve (gini = 0.52) describing the relationship between ECD spending 
and  inequality.  From  this  value  on,  the  relationship  becomes  positive.  The  same  happen  with  the 
relationship of education ECD spending and inequality, with a turning point of 0.53 for the gini index. 

With respect the lagged illiteracy rate variable, the sign of the coefficient estimate is positive in all 
versions of the model where this variable was included. Then, the Education ECD spending is higher where 
the illiteracy rate was higher in 2000, thereby apparently confirming the hypothesis of diminishing marginal 
utility  of  ECD  public  spending.  Differently  from  the  obtained  results  for  the  Education  spending 
determinants, the health ECD spending is negatively related to the lagged children mortality rate. That is, 
the municipalities with  the higher  children mortality rate in  2000 spent more in  primary  health  care for 
children during 2007 to 2011.   

Regarding the variables representing the political environment, the reelection of the Mayor has no 
impact on ECD spending. It is worth noting that, excepting the margin of victory in the last elections, none 
of  the  political  variables  seems  to  explain  the  variability  of  health  ECD  spending  across  Brazilian 
municipalities. However, in the municipalities where the Mayor finished secondary and tertiary education, 
Education ECD spending is about 6% higher than the municipalities where the mayor is illiterate or has 
other  education  level.  The  fact  that  the  Political  Party  of  the  Mayor  is  the  same  of  the  Governor  of  the 
President does not matter for determining Education ECD spending. Contrasting with this result, the ECD 
spending is positively related to the fact that the municipality receives transfers from the State Government 
as counterpart of Agreements between State and municipality. The margin of victory in the election has a 
positive effect on ECD spending.  

The  estimate  result  for  the  variable  Spending  Capacity  indicates  that  municipalities  with  higher 
share of locally collected taxes on total spending can spend more in Health. Fiscal decentralization variables 
play an important role for determining Education and  health ECD spending. The estimates for spending 
capacity coefficient indicate an even larger effect on ECD spending: one standard deviation of spending 
capacity variable would raise health ECD spending by 0.17 standard deviation.  

With respect the tax share variable, one standard deviation of the share of local collected tax in total 
receipts  would  increase  Total  ECD  spending  by  0.05  standard  deviation.  The  estimates  for  spending 
capacity coefficient indicate an even larger effect on ECD spending: one standard deviation of spending 
capacity variable would rise ECD spending by 0.23 standard deviation. The revenue volatility negatively 
impacts education and health ECD spending. It means that, the municipalities presenting more stability in 
revenue over the years spend more in education and health.  

4.2 Efficiency scores 
 
This section presents the main results on the performance indicators of ECD public spending across 
Brazilian municipalities. Verifying the distribution of technical efficiency (unbiased score) in Figure 2, we 
identify important differences between the education and health care scores14. In education, we find DMUs 
operating with, on average, 82% of efficiency. In the sample of municipalities, 625 of them (about 16% of 
all DMUs) are at the left side of distribution (score below 72%) and 19% of DMUs present performance 
between 91% and 100%. For the health efficiency score, on average, the DMUs have 51% of efficiency. In 
general, the education efficiency score has a more left-skewed distribution, while the distribution of health 
score is right-skewed.

Table 7 shows the average of efficiency level for each region of the country, with information about 
unbiased score (obtained by bootstrap), confidence interval, biased score (without bootstrap), as well as 
information about the average of the inputs and outputs of each region. The average of technical efficiency 
index for ECD expenditures in Brazil is 82% in education and 51% in health care. We emphasize that the 
levels  of  efficiency  does  not  necessarily  imply  that  municipalities  present  good  indicators  in  these  two 
areas,  because  the  efficiency  indicator  is  generated  simply  by  the  comparison  of  DMUs  close  to  the 
efficiency frontier (defined by benchmarking units).

Table 7 reveals that, the unbiased and biased scores are very similar. The difference (on average) is 
of  1.45%  in  the  level  of  efficiency  in  education  and  0.97%  in  the  level  of  efficiency  in  health  model. 
However, when we look the bias at level of the DMU, we find municipalities with a bias higher than 10% 
in their education scores and cases exceeding 20% in performance indicator for health care. Hence, the use 
of the technique provided by Simar and Wilson (1998, 2000) allows minimize the biases in efficiency score, 
especially in cities with high sensitivity to changes in the technological frontier. 

The Brazilian municipalities in the most developed regions (South, Southeast and Midwest) are, on 
average, more efficient in education ECD spending. While the North and Northeast (less developed) regions 
have  the  most  inefficient  DMUs,  with  scores  below  the  country  average  and  insignificant  statistical 
differences between the regional results across these locations. Efficiency in heath spending is higher in 
South, Southeast and Midwest regions, when compared to North and Northeast regions, considering the 
biased and unbiased efficiency score.  Figure    and Figure  4,  for example, illustrate the kernel  density of 
efficiency scores within each region. Based on these findings, efficiency is higher in municipalities of the 
South,  Southeast  and Midwest  regions  due to  the concentration of municipalities close to  the efficiency 
frontier.

The shapes of Figures 3 and 4 results from the fact that the majority of the most efficient DMUs in 
ECD  spending  on  education  (86%  of  DMUs  more  precisely)  are  to  the  south  of  the  country.  The 
municipalities in the states of Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP) and Rio Grande do Sul 
(RS) have the highest levels of efficiency, respectively, on average, 88.5%, 88.3%, 88.0% and 86.5%. At 
the other extreme, the DMUs in the states of Acre (AC), Pará (PA), Amapá (AP) and Alagoas (AL) are the 
worst performers. In terms of inputs to education, we identify the less efficient units generally allocate less 
ECD resources per child and have even lower educational outcomes, specially, learning indicators. In this 
context, given the spending per child, the vector of educational outputs should increase by almost 30% to 
make efficient the municipalities located in the states of AC, PA, AP and AL.  

Regarding the health spending, municipal units with the best performance are highly concentrated 
in states of South and Southeast regions (about 95% of DMUs in the best class belong to these regions). 
The other characteristic of efficiency on Heath Care is a great amplitude of the class intervals (the lowest 
value is 19.65% and the hightest value is 98.78%), this diffetence is considerably higher than performance 
on education, and evideces the existence of very inneficient municipalities in health spending. The results 
reveal that DMUs in the states of North and Northeast have relatively the worst combination of inputs and 
outputs.  

4.3 Efficiency determinants 

 

 

Table  shows the estimated coefficients for the determinants of the efficiency of ECD spending in 
Brazil. Initially, jointly evaluating all coefficients, we find that not necessarily the signs, the magnitude and 
statistical significance of the parameters are the same. It is worth noting that we are analyzing two different 
types of services, which have their particularities in attendance and financing, for example. In education it 
is easier to identify the services offered for early childhood. Moreover, in health area, spillover effects may 
arise. In effect, it is quite common in Brazil transporting patients from one municipality to another, which 
can result in less expense (and higher efficiency) for the municipality that “exported” the patient and more 
costs (and lower efficiency) for the locality which received the patient.

Regarding the impacts of socioeconomic characteristics on efficiency scores, the municipalities with 
greater income inequality have lower spending efficiency. An increase of 1% in income inequality reduces 
the efficiency indicator of spending on education in 0.10%. This negative effect is also observed for the 
efficiency of health spending. The effects of per capita income and the proportion of adults with higher 
education in the city on efficiency is positive in all models for both areas. In education area, the coefficient 
for  illiteracy  for  the  population  between  11  and  14  years  old  is  negative  and  statistically  significant 
suggesting that the municipalities with more illiterates in this age group tend to be more inefficient.  

Looking at the DMUs demographic profile, we note that the population  composition, population 
density  and  population  size  of  the  municipality  generate  statistically  significant  effects  on  the 
municipalities’ performance, mainly in education spending. In general, larger shares of children under 5 
years old in the total population result in lower efficiency. Probably, this finding can be associated with the 
difficulty  of  municipal  management  to  offering  adequate  educational  and  health  services  when  the 
population in this age group represents a considerable portion of the total population. In some Brazilian 
municipalities, especially in the Northern region of the country, the population with less than 5 years old 
exceeds a ratio of 15% of the total population. 

Regarding the population group in the Table 8, the municipalities with larger populations have, on 
average, more difficult to efficiently allocate their resources in education when compared with DMUs with 
less than 10 thousand habitants (base regression). Differently we find that more populated municipalities 
tend  to  be  more  efficient  than  the  localities  of  smaller  population  size  for  the  performance  indicator  in 
health.  

In the specific case of education, the share of total enrollment in private schools does not generate 
significant effects. However, the enrollment rate in rural areas in the municipality is negatively associated 
with efficiency of educational resources. At this point, an interesting fact in Brazil is the difference between 
the services provided to students from rural areas, which traditionally already have an unfavorable family 

background (the illiteracy rate in rural areas is about twice the national average). When we checked the 
indicators of school quality, such as the index of school infrastructure (SII) and the proportion of teachers 
with higher education (TFT) by the quantilies of the rate of rural enrollments, we evidence that the greater 
is  the  share  of  enrollments  in  rural  areas,  the  lower  is  the  standard  of  school  quality  (see  Figure  5). 
Moreover, the spending level of these five quantiles are similar, and the highest spending per child (R$ 
2,336) occurs in the last quantile that refers to municipalities with the highest enrollment rate in rural area.

school (TFT) by five quantiles of rate of rural enrollments in Brazilian Municipalities

In general, the findings for the institutional dimension have better statistical adjustment (including 
coefficients with more statistical significance) for the analysis of the determinants of education spending 
efficiency. We highlight that municipalities with more volatility in their revenue have a lower education 
spending efficiency. For health sector, the effect of this variable is positive, but with statistical significance 
at  the  10%  level.  More  results  in  the  educational  and  health  care  areas  have  to  do  with  the  impact  of 
earmarked transfers on the efficiency score. According to the results, a higher Fundeb (for education) or 
SUS  (for  health  care)  transfer  per  capita  decreases  the  level  of  efficiency.  In  effect,  an  analysis  of  the 
outcomes used in the estimation of efficiency scores shows that municipalities that receive more transfers 
are among the cities that have the worst indicators of learning and school quality. These findings may stem 
from the existence of misapplication and consequent lack of effectiveness of the transferred resources. In 
addition,  the  DMUs  with  the  highest  per  capita  total  municipal  expenditure  maintained  a  positive 
relationship with performance in education. Here such information may be capturing the spending capacity 
of the municipality.  

We can also see that some variables related to the electoral process (as the numbers of voters who 
voted in the election – voter turnout – and the rate of valid votes) impact the efficiency of health spending 
and, especially, education spending. The re-election of the mayor affects positively just the efficiency in 
education. In this case voters seem to recognize the DMU which showed some improvements in educational 
outcomes. 

Finally,  we  point  out  that  locational  variables  confirm  its  importance  in  explaining  spending 
efficiency. Controlling for those institutional and socioeconomic covariates, the health efficiency scores in 
municipalities  of  the  Northeast  region  are  slightly  lower  than  the  results  from  the  Southeast  region. 
Concerning  educational  performance,  DMUs  in  the  Southeast  and  South  regions  have  statistically 
significant superior results to those observed in the municipalities located in other regions.

In the last two decades, undoubtedly, Brazil has been experienced several advances in the provision 
of ECD services. Concomitantly, to decentralization of the provision of public services, the spending in this 
area has been growing in all Brazilian regions even more than the GDP, but this growth in public spending 
has not been a specific trend for ECD services. Other spending categories have grown at the same rate over 
the period.   

However,  analyzing  sub-national  differences  on  ECD  provision  one  can  notice  important 
differences  mainly  between  the  Northern  and  Southern  municipalities.  The  Brazilian  South  Region  has 
better  socioeconomic  indicators  and  per  child  ECD  spending  is  high.  In  the  North  (and  also  Northeast 
region), poverty and inequality is high, but per child ECD spending is low. Apparently, this result suggests 
that the responsiveness of ECD spending to local needs is low.  

The  conditional  analysis  on  the  determinants  of  ECD  spending  shows  that  socioeconomic  and 
demographic  context  of  the  municipality  explain  the  major  part  of  variation  of  ECD  spending  across 
Brazilian  municipalities.  With  respect  the  responsiveness  to  local  needs,  controlling  for  a  number  of 
variables,  ECD  spending  is  higher  in  the  municipalities  which  presented  higher  illiteracy  rates  in  2000, 
suggesting, politicians preferences were linked to the perceived local needs for ECD services. But, ECD 
spending is lower where inequality is high.  

As pointed out earlier, an important feature of decentralization in Brazil was the high participation 
of  transfers  on  municipal  budgets.  According  to  the  findings,  the  municipalities  with  higher  spending 
capacity (less transfers dependent) are more prone to spend on ECD.  

In  the  efficiency  analysis,  the  results  show  that  the  DMUs  operating  in  a  better  socioeconomic 
environment (higher per capita income e lower inequality) can more efficiently allocate their resources to 
early childhood. As a result, the evaluation of technical efficiency must be viewed with more caution in 
locations  with  adverse  social  context.  Certainly,  in  these  localities,  it  necessary  to  implement  policies 
aiming to improve management and find mechanisms to identify cases of misallocation of resources such 
as cases from rural areas that have high spending without counterpart of good indicators in school resources.
