Abstract

Empirical studies concerning the determinants of child labor are widespread and consolidated
in literature. However, most emphasize the role of individual or family-level factors. As contri-
bution, we test the hypothesis that society-level factors also play key roles on the rate of child
labor in Brazil. The main focus of this study is to investigate if the Bolsa Fam´ılia conditional
cash transfer and the Labor Inspection activities contributed to reduce the rate of child la-
bor. Alongside, we verify the role of other important factors such as: poverty, unemployment,
urbanization and proportion of children and adolescents enrolled in school. For this, we aggre-
gate individual data from 2004–2009 and 2011–2014 PNAD to state level and adopted panel
data models. Our empirical results do not permit to conclusively sustain the hypothesis that
the Bolsa Fam´ılia program and the Labor Inspection contributed to reduce child labor rate in
Brazil.

1. Introduction

Article 60 of the Brazilian statute for children and adolescents, recognized in Law no 8069 of
the Federal Constitution, prohibits any labor activity to minors under the age of 16, except in
the condition of apprenticeship as from the age of 14. Still in 2014, there are about 3,3 million
child laborers between age 5 and 17 in Brazil (IBGE-PNAD, 2014). Speciﬁcally, about 2% of
this total are between age 5 and 9, about 25% between age 10 and 14, and about 73% between
age 15 and 17. Despite the remarkable achievements of the Brazilian government concerning
the combat of child labor over time, these numbers are still alarming. Thus, the contribution
of studies concerning the potential determinants of child labor continue vital.

Empirical studies concerning determinants of child labor is widespread in Brazilian liter-
ature. However, majority use individual data to investigate factors that lead children and
adolescents to work. Such approach permits to account for the eﬀect of individual and family
speciﬁc factors such as, for example, skin color, gender, family income, parent’s level of edu-
cation, family structure, etc (Kassouf, 2001; Schwartzman and Schwartzman, 2001; Cacciamali
and Tatei, 2008; Kassouf and Justus, 2010; Aquino et al., 2010). Nevertheless, these studies
do not account for relevant macro-level determinants of child labor rate such as, for example,
income inequality, urbanization, poverty and unemployment, etc.

The only empirical study which sought to explain the rate of child labor in Brazil is that
of Ramalho and Mesquita (2013). These authors used a panel data of Brazilian states over
the period of 2001 to 2009. Although the main objective of the study was to investigate
the determinants of child labor rate in urban Brazilian states, greater attention was given
to temporal dynamics and informality. Notwithstanding the contribution in these aspects,
these authors omitted several relevant macro-level determinants of child labor rate such as
urbanization, unemployment rate and the proportion of children enrolled in schools. Moreover,
the only factor treated as endogenous during model speciﬁcation was family income, leaving
out the Bolsa Fam´ılia program. This program is endogenous since participation in the program
is conditioned to the nonexistence of child laborers in the family. Thus, the omission of relevant
factors and the negligence of potential endogeneity makes estimates inconsistent.

Therefore, our contribution towards the study of Ramalho and Mesquita (2013) is that it
controls additional macro-level factors which has been deemed relevant by theoretical studies.
Moreover, on this course we measure the impact of governmental social programs in combating
child labor. Furthermore, we account for endogeneity using appropriate methods.

In short, the main objective here is to investigate the eﬀect of the Bolsa Fam´ılia conditional
cash transfer program (henceforth, PBF) and Labor Inspection on the rate of child labor among
Brazilian states. Concerning this objective, we put forward the hypothesis that both measures
contributed to reduce child labor rate from 2004 to 2014. On the one hand, the PBF program
ease ﬁnancial strain of poor families, conditioning them to enroll their children in school. On
the other hand, the Labor Inspection withdraw children from work, gives them social assistance
and also ﬁnes exploiters of the labor of children and adolescents.

As per structure, aside this introductory section, Section 2 presents a detailed review of
previous evidences. Section 3 presents the data, empirical strategy and procedure. Section 4
provides the empirical results. Section 5 is conclusive.

2. Previous Evidences

As spotlight is on macro-level determinants3, in this section we review the literature which
treats the impacts of economic progress on child labor. As economic progress, we refer to the

(2007) and ILO (2007).

levels of poverty, unemployment, economic growth and urbanization.

Poverty

Poverty has been overtly concurred, in most theoretical and empirical literature, to be the
major determinant of the supply of child labor both at the micro and macro level. From the
micro-level stance, many empirical studies (Basu and Van, 1998; Kassouf, 2001; Edmonds and
Turk, 2002; Kassouf, 2002; Basu, 2003; Hilowitz et al., 2004a) defend that families send children
to work only if adult’s income does not cover the basic needs of the family. Thus, families in
situation of poverty or extreme poverty are more likely to send children to work, since rich
families do not depend on children’s income for subsistence. From the macro-level angle, studies
such as Galli (2001), Edmonds (2005), Edmonds and Pavcnik (2005) and Kambhampati and
Rajan (2006) concluded that macroeconomic progress reduces child labor. This is because richer
societies can oﬀer more free and quality education, better health services and also adopt poverty
reduction measures, compared to poorer societies. Moreover, richer societies have higher level
of adult wage, which directly reduces micro-level poverty.

Inasmuch as poverty is widely accepted as a major cause of child labor, some studies (Barros
et al., 1994; Ray, 2000; Rogers and Swinnerton, 2004; Kambhampati and Rajan, 2006; Dumas,
2007; Kassouf and Justus, 2010; Rep´orter Brasil, 2013; Sarkar and Sarkar, 2016) have questioned
this relation. In short, these authors claim that the validity of the hypothesis of poverty as the
major cause of child labor is doubtful. However, there is, yet, no consensus regarding the basis
of such argument in literature. In Barros et al. (1994) and Ray (2000), no evidence was provided
concerning the invalidity of the hypothesis. However, Bhalotra and Heady (2003) empirically
defended, using Ghanaian and Pakistani data, the wealth paradox that children from families
with larger farm size (proxy for family wealth in agrarian societies) are most likely to be child
laborers compared to children from families with smaller farm size.

Similar evidence was found by Dumas (2007) and Kassouf and Justus (2010) who considered
farm size a proxy for family wealth. On the one side, Dumas (2007) reinstated the wealth
paradox, adding that the labor supply of minors is an aftermath of labor market imperfections
in rural Burkina Faso. On the other side, Kassouf and Justus (2010) contributed to this motion,
using Brazilian data, by indicating that the probability distribution of child labor in function
of farm size is a parabola opening downwards. Thus, child labor increases with greater family
farm size but reaches a speciﬁc maximum point from which it declines.

Level of Urbanization

According to previous studies, urbanization rate is also an important determinant of child
labor. This is not only because of the diﬀerence in the level of poverty, but also due to
peculiarities attached to the type of child labor concentrated in both rural and urban areas
in terms of proportion, visibility and sectoral distribution. There is consensus in national and
international literature that the rate of child labor is greater in rural areas. However, in Brazil,
despite higher rates are observed in the rural areas, the number of children and adolescents who
work is higher in the urban areas due to the high population density (Inai´a, 2008; Rep´orter
Brasil, 2013; Kassouf, 2015).

Other factors which increase the labor force of children and adolescents in the urban area is
the availability of better quality education, health services and greater economic opportunities.
Such factors tend to encourage migration from rural to urban areas. It is, however, important
to note that inasmuch as the conditions of an urbanized area apparently seem better, one has
to take into account the eﬀect of inequality and wage diﬀerences between skilled and unskilled
workers. According to Barros et al. (1994), the socioeconomic condition of poor households or
unskilled workers in the urban areas is more harsh compared to the same group in rural areas.
Some plausible reasons for this are wage gap between skilled and unskilled labor, higher cost
of living, more competitive labor markets, etc. (Ferreira-Batista and Cacciamali, 2012).

Sectorial Distribution

The activities in which children and adolescents are engaged vary signiﬁcantly. However,
there is consensus in literature that the agricultural sector is most responsible for the usage of
this vulnerable labor force in Brazil (Kassouf, 2004). In the ﬁndings of this author, about 54.2%
of the child laborers between age 5 and 15 were engaged in agricultural activities, especially
in the rural areas. In descendant order of the sectoral participation of child laborers of the
same age group, the agricultural sector was followed by the service and commercial sectors
with 18.5% and 14.7%, respectively. In the same year, the industrial sector was responsible
for the employment of about 7.2%, while the construction sector employed about 2.1% of child
laborers.

According to Inai´a (2008) and the report published by Rep´orter Brasil (2013), aside the
concentration of child labor in the agricultural sector, some of its features are quite worrisome.
These features include high incidence of recruitment of child laborers between age 5–9, pref-
erence for boys, long working hours, work with sharp objects, exposure to toxic materials and
intense solar radiation. Still, it is important to note that children and adolescents are employed
by the family in numerous cases in the rural Brazilian areas. Generally, in such instance, child
labor is conceived as positive to the development of a child and also as helping hand, form of
socialization and heir training by the family (Marin et al., 2012).

DeGraﬀ et al. (2016) focused their study on child laborers engaged in risky occupations
which cause harm to their health, safety and morals. These authors chose their deﬁnition of
“risky” following speciﬁcations of the ILO and the Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment.
Speciﬁcally, the categories of risky occupations addressed in this study are domestic workers,
street workers, construction workers and farm workers engaged in the cultivation of tobacco,
coﬀee, sugar cane and manioc. Having that the ILO regulations and Brazilian Constituition
prohibit risky work for individuals below age 18, these authors considered the age group between
10 and 17. General ﬁndings from this study point that most child laborers in risky working
conditions are engaged in domestic services and hazardous farming, followed by the construction
and street work. These authors also found that this ranking order is preserved in both rural and
urban areas, however, there were relatively greater proportions in the former compared to the
latter. As per gender distribution in these risky occupations, it was found that there is greater
concentration of girls in hazardous occupations. Speciﬁcally, most of these girls are involved in
domestic services, while boys are mostly involved in construction activities, hazardous farming
and street work.

Unemployment

Very few studies have been carried out regarding the eﬀect of economic growth and adult
unemployment on child labor in Brazil. Empirical evidences from Edmonds (2005), using
Vietnamese data, points that child labor reduces with economic growth, however, highlighting
that such relationship is non-linear. In contradiction, Kambhampati and Rajan (2006) found
empirical evidence, using data from India, that contrarily to conventional wisdom, increase in
economic growth increases child labor as aftermath of the increase in the demand of cheaper
labor by ﬁrms. The authors, however, noted that child labor is only reduced when growth
is sustained suﬃciently to outweigh increase in the demand of cheaper and unregulated labor.
Abu-Ghallous (2012), using Palestinians data, concluded that increase in unemployment, which
is also indicative of economic progress, leads to increase in the rate of child labor.

As for Brazil, Duryea et al. (2007) used Brazil’s Monthly Employment Survey (PME, in
Brazilian acronym) to analyze the impact of household economic shocks, especially unemploy-
ment, on schooling and employment of youths in metropolitan Brazil. The empirical strategy
used was that of probit model and the database adopted covered about 100.000 children between
age 10 and 16 from 1982 to 1999. The hypothesis alleged goes in line with that theoretically

4

posed by Basu (1999) and Galli (2001) that adult unemployment may lead to increase in child la-
bor. The general estimation results provided statistically robust evidence which does not reject
this hypothesis. Speciﬁcally, unemployment shocks to male household head in the metropolitan
Brazil increases the likelihood of children between age 14 and 16 to enter the labor market.
However, in a speciﬁc model where authors created an interaction variable between employment
shocks and a dummy variable indicating children between age 10 and 14, statistically robust
evidence was found concerning a negative relationship between adult unemployment and child
labor. Although counterintuitive, such idea supports the observation made by Basu and Van
(1998) concerning the possible ambiguous eﬀect of adult unemployment on child labor.

Conditional Cash Transfer Program

There are variety of welfare programs adopted in Brazil to ease poor and extremely poor
families of ﬁnancial constraints. Similarly to other developing countries, one of these measures
involve conditional direct cash or in-kind transfer.

One of the ﬁrst conditional cash transfer (henceforth, CCT) programs – Bolsa Escola and
Renda M´ınima 4 – were created in the mid 1995s in the city of Campinas located in the state
of S˜ao Paulo. These programs granted ﬁnancial subsidy to poor parents, who were obliged to
enroll their children in schools. In 1996, the Program for Elimination of Child Labor (PETI,
in Brazilian acronym) was created due to the high proportion and stark situation of children
in the labor market. Speciﬁcally, the PETI had the objective of withdrawing children and
adolescents between age 7 and 15 from hazardous work and enroll them in schools (Soares and
S´atyro, 2010). Aside enrollment in schools, the PETI program required children to participate
in extracurricular sport, cultural, artistic and leisure activities in order to inhibit time allocation
to work. Despite greater attention was given to children and adolescents, the PETI program
also created job opportunities for families who earn less than half of the minimum salary in
order to prevent such families to send children back to work.

In 2003, all the cash and in-kind transfer programs designed to reduce poverty were united
form a single conditional cash transfer program – the Bolsa Fam´ılia Program (henceforth, PBF),
which has nationwide coverage. The participation of families in the PBF was conditioned to
the level of income. Whereas, for continuity of participation, beneﬁciary families have to meet
additional conditions concerning health care and enrollment and attendance of children in
school. Therefore, one can suppose that the program seek to increase the human capital of
poor families through education and health, which in turn yield better income distribution in
the long run and also break poverty cycle.

In 2005, the PETI program was incorporated together with the PBF cash transfer for the
sake of better management and to exploit the synergy between both programs. Despite the
critics regarding the amalgamation of these welfare programs, numerous studies have pointed
out that such action was imminent in order to optimize public resources, increase coverage and
enhance accessibility of grants by eligible families. Albeit the main characteristics of the PETI
program were maintained, the major objective of the PBF program is to reduce poverty.

In speciﬁc, the PBF program attends families which are below the poverty line5, giving
priority to families with pregnant women or children or adolescents under age 17. Regarding
ﬁnancial values, a ﬁxed amount of R$77 (Brazilian currency) is transferred to extremely poor
families irrespective of family structure.
In addition, a variable amount between R$35 and
R$175 is passed on to poor and extremely poor families depending on the family structure.
Having that the PBF program only addresses families below the poverty line, the PETI pro-

4Schooling grant and Minimum Wage, respectively.

monthly per capita income, respectively.

gram was reconﬁgured to focus on families child laborers from families above the poverty line.
However, the value transferred is expressively lower than that of the PBF program – R$ 25 per
child to families who reside in rural or urban areas with less than 250 thousand inhabitants and
R$ 40 per child to families who reside in urban areas with more than 250 thousand inhabitants6.
Most empirical studies which sought the eﬀect of CCT programs on child labor analyze its
eﬀect on the time allocation of children and adolescents. Findings from international studies
such as Ravallion and Wodon (2000) and Maluccio and Flores (2005) point out that CCT
programs produce positive eﬀect on schooling and inverse eﬀect on child labor. Attanasio et al.
(2006) also, empirically, supported this ﬁnding aﬃrming that CCT programs cause signiﬁcant
increase in time allocated to studies and also increases the school enrollment of children who are
prone to enter the labor market early. However, studies such as Duryea and Morrison (2004)
and Glewwe and Olinto (2004) fail to ﬁnd eﬀect of cash transfer programs on child labor.

In Brazil, there are still very few empirical studies which investigated the eﬀect of the PBF

program on child labor. Therefore, no consensus is reached yet.

Cardoso and Souza (2004), using 2000 census data and propensity score methods, analyzed
the impact of the Bolsa Escola program7 on child labor and school attendance. These authors
found that the program had signiﬁcant positive eﬀect on school attendance for both boys and
girls. However, the program was found shorthanded in the task of reducing child labor. In
fact, the author observed that cash transfer were too small to persuade families to forgo income
from child work. Instead, families preferred children to combine work and school. They also
concluded that even if cash transfer could cover child’s income parents and children may not
be convinced to renounce extra income if the contribution of the child to family income is high.
Ferro and Kassouf (2005) used 2001 PNAD data to also verify if the Bolsa Escola had
signiﬁcant eﬀect on child labor. Speciﬁcally, these authors opted for probit models to identify
if the program inﬂuences the probability of a child to work or not, and adopted weighted least
square methods to ascertain if the program, at least, reduces the weekly hours of work of
children who are already in the labor market. Regarding working hours, Ferro and Kassouf
(2005) found evidence that participation in the program reduces about 3 working hours of child
laborers. However, these authors highlighted that such reduction has limited eﬀect in the sense
that it covers, mostly, children who do part-time work. This is because most children who
engage in full term jobs have less incentive to participate in the program due to its modest
values. Result concerning the probability of working pointed that children from families which
participated in the program are more likely to work.

In line with ﬁndings in Ferro and Kassouf (2005), Ferro et al. (2010) used 2003 PNAD data
to estimate probit models and propensity score matching approach. These authors concluded
that the Bolsa Escola program reduces the probability of children from beneﬁciary families
to work and increases the school enrollment of the same. However, no evidence was found
concerning working hours or conciliation of work and schooling. Speciﬁcally, Ferro et al. (2010)
pointed that the program reduces probability of working by 2 to 3 p.p. in the urban areas and
6 to 9 p.p. in rural areas.

Regarding the PBF program, Cacciamali et al. (2010) analyzed its impact on child labor
and school attendance using 2004 PNAD data to estimate probit models. The estimates from
these models indicated positive relationship between the PBF program and child labor, i.e,
children from beneﬁciary families are more likely to work. These conclusion was sustained in
models for urban and rural areas, and also in models for separate regions in Brazil. However,
Cacciamali et al. (2010) found that the program was eﬃcient in increasing school attendance
of children and adolescents. These authors clariﬁed that, diﬀerent from the PETI program, the

main objective of the PBF program is not to eliminate child labor but to reduce poverty.

Still on the eﬀect of the PBF program, Araujo et al. (2010) sought empirical evidence
regarding its role on child labor among beneﬁciaries who reside in Brazilian urban areas. The
methodological strategy used to reach this objective was that of propensity score matching
using 2006 PNAD data. Similarly to previous authors, Aquino et al. (2010) concluded that
the PBF program was eﬃcient in increasing the school attendance and enrollment of children
and adolescents. However, the program presented shortcomings regarding the reduction of child
labor. These authors also buttressed the role of household unobservables in the decision of child
labor supply and participation in the PBF program. Also adopting propensity score matching
method for 2011 PNAD data, Do Nascimento et al. (2016) concluded that participation in the
PBF program has no signiﬁcant eﬀect neither on the probability of a child to work nor working
hours. However, evidence was found that the sum transferred to families contribute to reduce
the probability of child labor, likewise working hours.

Conclusively, these studies pointed that the participation in PBF program has no conspicu-
ous eﬀect on the probability of children and adolescents to work. However, most studies found
its eﬀect in reducing working hours. Such unsatisfactory eﬀect of this program may be due
to, ﬁrstly, the low elasticity of child labor to changes in poverty as pointed by Kassouf (2001),
Schwartzman and Schwartzman (2001), Emerson and Souza (2003) and Cacciamali et al. (2010).
It is also important to take into account that, as theoretically pointed out by Das and Deb
(2006), the value transferred to families are relatively too low compared to the income of child
laborers. Thus, extremely poor families are less motivated to participate in the program and
those who opt to participate are less willing to withdraw children from work8.

Labor Inspection

As aftermath of the dramatic increase in the number of children and adolescents working in
the 1980s, the Brazilian government recognized child labor as a problem which deserves priority.
One of the adopted measures was the Labor Inspection with focus on child labor. These Labor
Inspection activities are conducted by the Secretariat of Labor Inspection (SIT), which is part
of the Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE).

Concerning the inspection process, an annual plan is drawn by the Regional Superinten-
dencies of Labor and Employment (SRTEs) based on the guidelines of the SIT. ThiS plan is
sketched taking in account the reports of child labor, prioritizing the worst forms of child la-
bor. Having planned, labor inspectors are responsible for the preventive actions and inspection
activities. The preventive actions involve awareness-creation by publicizing the negative im-
pacts of child labor through lectures, seminars, debates and campaigns to children, employers
and families. Months after preventive actions labor inspectors conduct inspection activities,
which involve visit of businesses or workplaces in urban and rural areas throughout the country
(ILO/SIT, 2010).

During these visits, inspectors identify irregularities concerning child labor, ﬁll out an ex-
amination form regarding the characteristics of the work exercised by the child, withdraw child
from work and issue infraction reports regarding exploiter, which may lead to ﬁning. In order
to avoid return to work, children and adolescents are included in social welfare programs. In
speciﬁc, children under the age of 14 are enrolled in cash transfer programs conditioned to
school attendance and participation in social, educational and health care projects. Moreover,
adolescents above the age of 14 are enrolled in apprenticeship programs, which oﬀer technical
training in workplaces with the intention of learning and not production. In addition, the SIT

Kassouf (2015).

published data regarding the undertaken inspection activities in the Information System of
Child Labor (SITI) since 2006.

The ILO/SIT (2010) report pointed out to positive results of the Labor Inspection in Brazil
concerning the number of children which have been withdrawn from work. Still, this report
added that the eﬃciency of the inspection activities should not be measured only take into
account the number of children removed from work, but also by the awareness-creation. This is
because the preventive actions undertaken by inspectors increased the visibility of child labor
issues in the society, which impacted on the attitude of the media, governmental institutions,
employers and families.

The only empirical study found regarding the eﬀect of Labor Inspection on child labor till
date9 was that of Almeida (2015). Having that most inspection decisions are taken based
on complaints ﬁled regarding child labor, the estimation of the eﬀect of Labor Inspection on
child labor is subdue to underestimation and endogeneity. Therefore, this author adopted a
two-step generalized minimum least squares method using data for 2000 and 2010 from census
and SITI database. In the ﬁrst stage estimation the distance between inspection agencies and
ﬁrms and the number of labor inspectors were used as instruments in order to estimate number
of inspections. Subsequently, the estimate for Labor Inspection was inserted as regressor in
the second stage model, which was for child labor. As for year 2000 and 2010 data, it was
found that 1% increase in the number of labor of inspection reduces the proportion of child
laborers between age 10 and 17 in 0.22% and 0.26%, respectively. In absolute terms, the Labor
Inspection accounted for the reduction of, approximately, 8,658 and 8,856 child laborers in year
2000 and 2010, respectively.

Based on the empirical literature presented in this section, it is possible to create insight
of the signs and challenges expected from our modeling exercises. We expect an inverse re-
lationship between poverty and child labor rate. However, previous studies point that the
degree of such relationship is lower than expected. Reviewed studies indicate that child labor
is lower in urban regions, i.e, we expect a negative relationship between urbanization and child
labor rates. As to sectoral distribution, one expects to ﬁnd higher rates of child labor in the
agricultural sector compared to the service, trade and industrial sectors. As to unemployment
rate, consensus was observed in empirical studies towards a positive sign, i.e, the increase in
unemployment rate should lead to increase in the rate of child labor. Last but not the least, the
signs expected from the main variables of interest, PBF and Labor Inspection, are negative. On
the one hand, most empirical studies found that children from poor families who beneﬁt from
the PBF program have lesser probability of working compared to children from poor families
who do not participate in the program. On the other hand, empirical evidence sustain the
hypothesis that the Labor Inspection contributed to reduce child labor in Brazil.

The major challenge for the modeling exercise is endogeneity. The variables of interest
PBF and Labor Inspection are suspected to be highly endogenous since they are governmental
factors which are also determined by the level child labor. The empirical strategy adopted to
circumvent this challenge will be detailed in the next section.

Source: Prepared using data from PNAD.
Note: Number of observations is 270, except for the inspect variable which has 207 observations.

As we focus on the macro-level determinants of child labor and the eﬀect of intra-national
policies adopted by the Brazilian government to combat child labor, individual data from PNAD
were aggregated to Brazilian state level. Therefore, both continuous and dummy variables were
transformed in means and proportions computed using the weights or sample expansion factors
provided by the IBGE in the data ﬁles. By aggregating data to state level and covering the
period between 2004 and 2014 (without data for 2010), we create a panel data composed
by 27 states over 10 years. Note that data concerning the Labor Inspection only covers the
period between 2006 and 2014 and had missings for some states. Thus, instead of having 210
observations (27 states times 10 years), we ended up with the total of 207. However, the overall
panel data is strongly balanced, even though with few gaps.

Table 1 presents the mean and standard deviation for variables that are considered for
model speciﬁcation. Note that the standard deviation is decomposed into between and within
deviations. From this table, we observe that the former is greater than the latter for all variables.
This implies that there is expressive heterogeneity among states.

The rate of child labor among individuals between age 5 and 15 during the period of 2004 to
2009 and 2011 to 2014 was about 6.29%. As per family variables, an average Brazilian family is
comprised of, on average, 4 members and the level of education of mothers was approximately
8 years. During this same period, the average per capita family income was, approximately,
R$ 715. Regarding the childeduc variable, it is quite impressive to observe that about 92%
of children between age 5 and 15 were enrolled in school during the period in view10. The two

variables of interest, PBF and inspect, indicate that the average per capita value transferred
by the PBF is about 88 reais and that about 176 work inspections are conducted all over the
states during the period of 2004–2009 and 2011–2014. We also observe that the unemployment
rate during the referred period was at about 6%.
It is quite important to recall that these
statistics are only for general insight concerning the magnitude and scale of variables.

3.2. Econometric Procedures

In order to adequately model the macro-level determinants of child labor in Brazil we
adopted a procedurally constructive strategy and present the results in Table 2. Note that the
focus here is on estimates, but on the choice of model which best suits the objective of this
study.

In terms of model speciﬁcation, the response variable is the rate of child labor. Speciﬁcally,
child laborer is any individual between the age of 5 and 15 involved in any labor activity deemed
formal or informal, domestic or non-domestic, temporary or permanent, paid or unpaid labor
activities, except in condition of apprenticeship. This variable is denoted as childlabor.

The group of regressors is composed of the: proportion of children and adolescents between
age 5 and 15 enrolled in school (childeduc); average family income per capita (famincome); av-
erage years of mothers’ schooling (mothereduc); average number of family members (familysize);
per capita value transferred by the PBF program to states (PBF); number of Labor Inspections
with focus on child labor (inspect)11; unemployment rate among economically active popu-
lation (unemp); urbanization rate (urban): group dummy for years to control for time shocks
(years), and lastly; control for long-run tendency of a time series eﬀect of child labor (trend).

The starting point of the modeling exercise was the pooled regression

childlaborit = α + x(cid:48)

itβ + uit where uit = αi − α − εit

(1)

estimated by OLS method alike a cross-sectional model. childlaborit is a column vector of
it is a matrix of N × K regressors which vary over time, t, and across
the response variable, x(cid:48)
state, i, and uit is the idiosyncratic error term which consists of time-invariant factors (αi)
and time-variant omitted factors (εit). Similarly to the conventional OLS model, the Pooled
OLS model also assumes exogeneity of regressors, E(uit|xit) = 0, conditional homoskedasticity,
it|xit) = σ2, and conditionally uncorrelated observations, E(uit ujt|xit xjt) = 0, where i (cid:54)= j.
E(u2
The violation of the exogeneity assumption leads to inconsistency of β estimates, whereas the
violation or relax of the last two assumptions makes the Pooled OLS model no longer fully
eﬃcient.

The results from this initial model is provided in column OLS of Table 2. The Breusch-Pagan
test for heteroskedasticity on this model provided a valthe OLS model, all likely unobservable
and omitted factors are incorporated with the error term, uit, and are assumed uncorrelated
with the regressors. However, in light of the heterogeneity among states, it is important to
control for states’ ﬁxed eﬀects. The reason for this is that factors such as cultural, ideological
and social beliefs may sprout innate diﬀerences among states (Basu, 1999). Such control is not
possible in the OLS models, so we resort to Fixed and Random Eﬀect models (FE and RE,
respectively). These models admit the presence of a time-invariant component in the error,
thus permitting control of state time-invariant unobservables.

tive changes over time.

11Due to unavailability of this focused inspection for years prior to 2006, little adjustments were made while

modeling equations with this variable so as to avoid observation loss for other regressors

Note: Standard errors in parentheses; ***, ** and * denote signiﬁ-
cance at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively; All variables, both the res-
ponse variable and its regressors, are logarithmized; The constant
term is the average eﬀect of state unobservables; N is the number
of observations.

Despite the FE and RE models account for unobservables, the treatment given by both
diﬀer. As to the FE model, the unobserved eﬀects, αi, are eliminated by mean-diﬀerencing,
since they are assumed to be time-invariant. Thus Eq. 1 is transformed in
(childlaborit − childlabori) = (xit − ¯xi)(cid:48)β + (εit − ¯εit).

(2)

Compared to the OLS model, the consistency of β in the FE model requires a weaker assumption
that E(εit|αi, xit) = 0. In other words, the time-invariant component, αi, of the composite
error, uit is permitted to correlate with regressors.

An extended version of the FE model was provided in the Stata software, where Eq. 2 is

written as follows

(childlaborit − childlabori + childlabor) = (xit − ¯xi + ¯¯x)(cid:48)β + (εit − ¯εit + ¯¯ε)

(3)

whereby ¯¯y, ¯¯x and ¯¯ε are grand mean of yit, xit and εit, respectively. The advantage of this
extension is that an intercept estimate and its respective level of signiﬁcance are provided,
which is the average of unobservables, αi.

The Random Eﬀect model (RE) is quite similar to the Fixed eﬀect model (FE) in the sense
that it admits and controls αi. However, in the RE model αi is assumed to be purely random
and not permitted to correlate with regressors, i.e, E(εit|αi xit) = E(εit|xit) = 0. The results
for both models are presented in columns FE-I and RE-I, respectively.

To statistically back up the abandon of the pooled OLS model, the F -test and the Breusch
and Pagan Lagrange-multiplier test were carried out. The former tests between FE model and
pooled OLS model, whilst the later tests between the RE model and pooled OLS model. With

11

a F -test value of 5.62 we reject the null hypothesis of the nonexistence of unobservable state
time-invariant eﬀects, αi. Likewise, having a value of ¯χ2 = 30.11 for the Breusch and Pagan
Lagrange-multiplier test, we reject the hypothesis that var(αi) (cid:54)= 0. This conﬁrms that it is,
indeed, important to control for time-invariant unobserved factors.

To choose between the FE and RE models, the Hausmann test was performed. With a
test value of 36.52, we reject the null hypothesis of no correlation between regressors and state
unobservables. Therefore, the RE model was abandoned for the FE model.

Ramalho and Mesquita (2013), using 2001–2009 PNAD data to estimate dynamic panel data
models, aﬃrmed the existence of temporal dynamics of child labor rate in Brazil. However,
the models estimated till now do not permit the inclusion of lagged dependent variable as
regressor. Following the steps of these authors, as per the control for temporal dynamic, we
used the System Dynamic Panel-Data Estimator (henceforth, GMM). Thus, our dynamic model
of order 1 in childlaborit is represented as

childlaborit = γ1childlabori,t−1 + x(cid:48)

itβ + αi + εit,

t = 1, ..., T and |γ| < 1

(4)

Aside providing consistent estimates for γ1 and β, the Arellano-Bond estimator accounts for
endogenous regressors. In model 4, xit can be treated as exogenous or endogenous. Exogenous
regressors are those which are uncorrelated with εit, they require no special treatment and
are used as instrument for themselves. As to endogenous regressors, E(xit εis) (cid:54)= 0 for s ≤ t
and E(xit εis) = 0 for s > t. However, such variables can be instrumented using their lagged
values. Moreover, due the moment condition that E(∆y1, t−1 εit) = 0, the GMM also permits
to use ∆childlabor1, t−1 as instrument (Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998).
In this study, we use all possible lags of endogenous variables as instruments, but we limited
lags of the response variable to the maximum of two. The reason for this is that, according to
Cameron and Trivedi (2010), the use of too many instruments for GMM estimator may cause
poor performance of asymptotic results.

The results obtained from the initial dynamic model are presented in column GMM-I of
Table 2. The variables considered exogenous in this model are unemp, familysize, mothereduc
and urban. The reason for this is that the decision of a child to work does not determine neither
of these variables at state level. On the contrary, the variables which we consider as endogenous
are famincome, gini, childeduc, PBF and inspect.

The famincome variable is suspected to be endogenous based on observation made by
Psacharopoulos (1997) and Basu (1999) that in extremely poor families, children tend to be
sole contributors to households income. In this sense, the endogeneity of the average per capita
family income tends to be high if the child’s income has signiﬁcant weight in the family income.
Despite the debate concerning the conciliation of work and schooling by a child, the simulta-
neous relationship between child labor and child education is in consensus in literature (Basu,
1999; Dessy and Pallage, 2001; Ranjan, 2001; Das and Deb, 2006). Therefore, the proportion
of enrolled children is potentially endogenous. However, such endogeneity is reduced if most
children conciliate schooling and work as observed by Kassouf (2002) and Kassouf (2015).

The government variables PBF and inspect are suspected to be highly endogenous. Specif-
ically, the number of Labor Inspections conducted in a speciﬁc region depends on the number
of complaints ﬁled about the use of child labor in the region. Similarly, the amount of money
transferred by the PBF to a certain region depends on the level of poverty of the region which,
in turn, determines the number of children working.

Arellano and Bover (1995) instructed that εit must be serially uncorrelated in order to
obtain consistent estimation of parameters. Formally, ∆εit are correlated with ∆εi, t−1, since
Cov(εit, εi, t−1 = Cov(εit − εi, t−1, εi, t−1 − εi, t−2) = −Cov(εi, t−1, εi, t−1) (cid:54)= 0, however, ∆εit
will not correlate with ∆εi, t−k for k ≥ 2. Loosely speaking, the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced errors, ∆εit,

12

are correlated in the AR(1) but not in subsequent orders. The statistic test that veriﬁes this
assumption is the Arellano-Bond test. The null hypothesis of this test is that there is no
autocorrelation in the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced errors. Another test used to verify if the dynamic panel
model is misspeciﬁed is the Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions. It is important to note
that this test assumes that errors are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), thus the
Sargan test cannot be run on the heteroskedastic-robust errors.

The Sagan test of overidentifying restrictions was performed on the GMM-I model to verify if
the instruments are valid. The model is considered overidentiﬁed because 189 instruments were
used to estimate 10 parameters, hence there were 179 overidentifying restrictions. Having that
the Sargan test assumes strict homogeneity of error, we apply this test on the regular standard
errors of the model. The value of this test was 209.87 with a p-value of 0.057, implying that
we do not reject the null hypothesis that overidentifying restrictions are valid at a level of 10%.
Note that Arellano and Bond (1991) pointed that the Sargan test overrejects in the presence of
heteroskedasticity. This might be the reason for the relatively low p-value, since there is clear
evidence of heteroskedasticity as observed in previous models.

Subsequently, the Arellano-Bond test for zero autocorrelation in ﬁrst-diﬀerenced errors was
performed since the GMM estimator requires that εit to be serially uncorrelated. Therefore,
we expect to reject the null hypothesis of no correlation at the ﬁrst order but not at higher
orders. The test value observed was z = −3.57 and p-value 0.004 at ﬁrst order and z = 0.92
and p-value 0.3557 at second order. Hence, the null hypothesis that Cov(∆εit, ∆εi, t−k) = 0 is
rejected at a level of 1%, i.e, error εit is serially uncorrelated.

At this point, we conclude that the GMM estimator best ﬁts the objective of this study. In
short, it permits to account for time dynamics, unobservable time-invariant factors and also to
control potential endogeneity caused by the loop of causality between the child labor rate and
its determinants.

Henceforth, the model GMM-I will be regarded as our benchmark model and all empirical

results will be based on this model and its variations.

4. Analysis of Empirical Results

The hypothesis which we analyze in this section is that Bolsa Fam´ılia cash transfer program
and the Labor Inspection activities contribute to reduce child labor rate in Brazil. To reach
this objective, as detailed in Section 3, we opted for dynamic panel models which permitted to
control the endogeneity of both governmental countermeasures.

In table 3, we present the benchmark model (GMM-I) from section 3.2 and two variations
of itself. In model GMM-II, we included lagged values of the main variables of interest, PBF and
insect, to verify if the eﬀect of both governmental countermeasures transcends to subsequent
periods. In the GMM-III model, we control for time shocks by including dummies for years
(years) so as to isolate the eﬀect of regressors from ﬁxed eﬀect of time in the rates of child
labor.

We statistically veriﬁed the importance of such control by performing the Wald test for
composite linear hypothesis. Having a test value of 44.25, we reject the null that all years
coeﬃcients are jointly equal to zero, therefore control for time ﬁxed eﬀects is necessary. Anal-
ogously, we tested the need to control for long-run tendency of time series (trend). The test
value was 10.73, thus, such control is statistically important. Nevertheless, we proceed with
empirical analysis by comparing results from this model with those from the benchmark model
so as to emphasize the importance of such controls.

From the benchmark model, which has no control for time shocks and lagged values of the
major variables of interest, PBF and inspect, we found empirical evidence which points that
both governmental countermeasures contributed to reduce child labor. However, with these

additional controls in model GMM-III, we notice that the eﬀect found for theses variables
turned not to be statistically signiﬁcant. Similar observation were made for the controls for
familysize and mothereduc. Thus, conclusion is drawn that in light of temporal shocks and
long-run tendency of time series there is no clear-cut empirical evidence concerning the eﬀect of
neither the Bolsa Fam´ılia conditional cash transfer program nor the Labor Inspection activities.
Similar results have been found in literature concerning the eﬀect of conditional cash trans-
fers in Brazil. For example, Cardoso and Souza (2004) and Ferro and Kassouf (2005) found
no empirical eﬀect of the Bolsa Escola program in reducing child labor, but found evidence
concerning its eﬀect on school attendance. Similarly, Aquino et al. (2010) and Do Nascimento
et al. (2016) found no eﬀect of the participation in the PBF program on the probability of
children to work or not. However, the latter authors found that the sum transferred to families
reduced the child labor, likewise working hours. Lastly, using the same estimation method as
that which we used in this study, (Ramalho and Mesquita, 2013) also found no signiﬁcant eﬀect
of the PBF. Nevertheless, we still argue that these authors omitted relevant controls and also
did no treat the endogeneity of the PBF program.

It is important to recall that the main objective of the program is poverty and not child
labor and also that the program has limitations concerning the coverage of child laborers since
it only focuses on families below the poverty line.

As per Labor Inspection, we acknowledge that Almeida (2015) provided the ﬁrst empirical
evidence concerning the eﬀect of inspection activities in reducing child labor. However, our
results do not provide suﬃcient empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. Notwithstanding,
we believe that the number of inspectors and inspection activities are still modest to account
for the scale of child labor in Brazil.

Nevertheless, as suggested by ILO/SIT (2010), we do not limit our deﬁnition of eﬃciency to
the outcomes and impacts of the Labor Inspection activities, but also recognize its unobservable
impacts on child labor. Speciﬁcally, the Labor Inspection aims to reduce child labor through
four channels: a) awareness creation, which prevents child labor in the ﬁrst place; b) inspection
which, directly reduces child labor; c) render of social assistance to withdrawn children, which
prevent them to return to work and; d) ﬁning of exploiters, which serves as penal measure to
caught ﬁrms and warning to others.

According to numerous studies (See Kassouf (2002), Hilowitz et al. (2004b), Inai´a (2008),
Aquino et al. (2010), Kassouf and Justus (2010), Marin et al. (2012) and ILO (2013), among
many others), the level of urbanization plays a very important role in the determination of the
rate of child labor. Speciﬁcally, evidence shows that most child laborers are found in the rural
area, especially in the agricultural sector. The incidence of child labor is higher in rural areas
mainly because of fewer inspections, high incidence of family agriculture and higher level of
poverty compared to urban areas. The importance of this variable is reﬂected in the magnitude
of its estimate. The coeﬃcient indicates that the rate of child labor reduces in, approximately,
1.2% for every increase of 1% urbanization rate.

According to Inai´a (2008) and Marin et al. (2012), child labor in the rural area tends to be
more hazardous because they involve the most invisible forms of child labor and are less passive
of reduction through inspection, especially in family agriculture and domestic services. Marin
et al. (2012) also aﬃrmed that child labor is higher in many Brazilian rural regions because it
is not considered as exploit, but as assistance, means of socialization and heir training. Note
that, in such cases, child labor is not necessarily caused by poverty, but by a category of social
norm which is referred to as ﬁlial interactions by L´opez-Calva et al. (2002). Rep´orter Brasil
(2013) concurs with Inai´a (2008) and Marin et al. (2012) regarding this, but added that child
labor in the urban area is more visible, however the most diﬃcult to eliminate.

Basu and Van (1998) and Galli (2001) theoretically demonstrated that child labor is posi-
tively related to adult unemployment in the sense that it reduces the level of family income and,

15

thus, may lead such household to send children to work. However, such relationship depends
on the labor market structure and the degree of substitution between adult and child labor. In
the case of an oligopsonic adult labor market, such relationship is observed, but Basu and Van
(1998) informed that the relationship between adult wage and child labor may be ambiguous in
a competitive labor market. Similarly, Galli (2001) pointed out that if child labor and unskilled
adult labor are substitutes, a exogenous increase in child labor supply can lead to the increase
in adult unemployment.

The estimate found for unemp indicates a negative relationship between the rate of child
labor and adult unemployment, thus, not corroborating the theoretical relationship pointed
by Galli (2001). However, the coeﬃcient observed goes in line with the evidence in Duryea
et al. (2007) for children between the age 10 and 14. A possible cause for this is that the
unemp variable captured the eﬀect of economic progress. In this way, one can interpret that the
reduction of economic progress led to both adult and child unemployment. Nevertheless, we
suggest further investigation of the eﬀect of the eﬀect of adult unemployment on child labor.

Finally, our results corroborate that found by Ramalho and Mesquita (2013) regarding the
existence of temporal dependence of the rate of child labor, γ. Speciﬁcally, we observed a
positive value of about 0.23. Similarly, these authors observed a positive sign and a value
of about 0.29.
In other words, despite the divergence of our model speciﬁcation from that
of these authors, we both conclude that the rate of child labor is dependent on itself over
time. Speciﬁcally, about 23% of previous rate of child labor is disseminated to current rates.
Therefore government policies to combat child labor may have time lagged eﬀect on the rate
of child labor.

5. Concluding Remarks

In this study, we investigated the determinants of child labor rate, however, paying special
attention to the role of two governmental social programs – PBF cash transfer and Labor
Inspection with focus on child labor. The hypotheses alleged was that both programs contribute
to reduce the child labor rate in Brazil. On the one hand, we alleged this hypothesis concerning
the Bolsa Fam´ılia program because it relieves poor and extremely poor families of ﬁnancial
burdens and conditions beneﬁciary families to enroll children in school. On the other hand, the
Labor Inspection is alleged to have mitigating eﬀect on child labor because it assumes the role
of withdrawing children from work so as to enroll them in school and give social assistance.
Moreover, it ﬁnes exploiters of child labor and creates awareness in the society concerning
magnitude and consequences of early work of children and adolescents.

These hypothesis were tested using dynamic panel models, which were estimated using
2004–2009 and 2011–2014 PNAD data aggregated by state. In light of time ﬁxed eﬀect, we did
not ﬁnd conclusive empirical evidence which permits to sustain the hypothesis that the PBF
and Labor Inspection contributed to reduce child labor rate in Brazil.

Among all factors controlled in the empirical model, only that for urbanization rate showed
elastic relationship with child labor rate. This indicate that adoption of regional policies that
promotes urbanization may cause highly responsive mitigating eﬀect on child labor rate. More-
over, urbanization sprouts other social beneﬁts as per access to better health, education and
infrastructural facilities, which in turn bolster overall economic growth. Despite these enticing
beneﬁts, it is noteworthy that urbanization policies have to take into account adverse eﬀects
such as increase in crime, unemployment, migration, poor living conditions, etc. Inclusively,
such conditions may end up wheeling child labor to invisible and worst forms such as prostitu-
tion, drug traﬃcking and street trading and services.

Lastly, we found empirical evidence which corroborates previous literature concerning the
intertemporal dependence of the rate of child labor in Brazil. Therefore, the eﬀect of govern-

16

mental countermeasures against child labor in a period may be disseminated to subsequent
periods.
