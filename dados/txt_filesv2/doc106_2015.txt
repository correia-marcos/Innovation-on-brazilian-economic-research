RESUMO  

O trabalho mostra que o modelo do supermultiplicador sraffiano prove um fechamento alternativo para a 
análise das relações entre crescimento, distribuição, utilização da capacidade e demanda efetiva em 
modelos heterodoxos de crescimento. O novo fechamento vem da variabilidade da razão entre as 
propensões média a marginal a poupar decorrente da hipótese da existência de gastos autônomos que não 
criam capacidade para o setor privado (que crescem a uma taxa exógena). Isto permite que a propensão 
marginal a investir determine a taxa de poupança da economia sem necessidade de mudanças na 
distribuição ou na propensão marginal a poupar. Junto com a hipótese adicional de que as mudanças na 
propensão marginal a investor são induzidas pela pressão competitiva que leva ao ajustamento gradual da 
capacidade a demanda, este ajustamento através the mudanças endógenas na razão entre as propensões 
média e marginal a poupar (a fração) nos prove um fechamento que  permite a reconciliação de 
crescimento liderado pela demanda, distribuição exógena e uma tendência a utilização normal da 
capacidade produtiva entre steady states. Uma análise comparativa tenta mostrar que este fechamento é 
uma alternativa mais satisfatória aos fechamentos tanto dos modelos  de crescimento da tradição de 
Cambridge quanto dos modelos kaleckianos.  

ABSTRACT 

The paper shows that the Sraffian Supermultiplier model provides an alternative closure for the analysis 
of the relationships between growth, distribution, capacity utilization and effective demand in heterodox 
growth models. The   new closure comes from the variability of the average to the marginal aggregate 
propensities to save entailed by the assumption of the existence of (independently growing) autonomous 
expenditures that do not generate capacity for the private sector. This allows the marginal propensity to 
invest to determine the savings ratio without the need of changes in distribution or in the marginal 
propensity to save. Provided that it is also assumed that changes in the marginal propensity to invest are 
induced   by the competitive   need to gradually adjust capacity to demand, this adjustment through 
endogenous changes in the ratio of the average to the marginal propensity to save (the fraction) gives   us 
a closure that allows us  to reconcile demand led growth, exogenous distribution and a tendency towards 
normal capacity utilization, even across steady states. A comparative analysis will try to  show that this is 
a more satisfactory alternative to the closures provided by both the Cambridge and the kaleckian growth 
models.

Introduction 

The paper has two purposes. The  first  is  to  show how   the Sraffian Supermultiplier model provides an 
alternative closure for the analysis of the relationships between growth, distribution, capacity utilization 
and effective demand in heterodox growth models. This    new closure comes from the variability of the 
average  to  the  marginal  aggregate  propensities  to  save  entailed  by  the  assumption  of  the  existence  of 
(independently  growing)  autonomous  expenditures  that  do  not  generate  capacity  for  the  private  sector. 
This allows the marginal propensity to invest to determine the savings ratio without the need of changes 
in distribution or in the marginal propensity to save. Provided that it is also assumed that changes in the 
marginal  propensity  to  invest  are  induced      by  the  competitive      need  to  gradually  adjust  capacity  to 
demand,  this  adjustment  through  endogenous  changes  in  the  ratio  of  the  average  to  the  marginal 
propensity  to  save  (the  fraction)  gives      us  a  closure  that  allows  us      to  reconcile  demand  led  growth, 
exogenous distribution and a tendency towards normal capacity utilization, even across steady states.  
The second purpose of the paper is to compare and constrast this new  closure with the closures provided 
by  both  the  Cambridge  and  the  kaleckian  growth  models  which  operate  ,  respectively,  through  the 
endogeneity    of    distribution  or  in  the  actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization.  It  will  be  argued  that  the 
closure based on the Sraffian Supermultiplier model and the fraction is a more satisfactory alternative to 
the closures provided by both   the Cambridge and the kaleckian growth models. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 first presents the Sraffian Supermultiplier model 
(in  the  version  used  in  Freitas  &  Serrano  (2015))  and  how  its  closure  operates,  as  capacity  adjusts  to 
demand and then shows the results of permanent effects of changes in the rate of growth of autonomous 
consumption and in income distribution (or in the marginal propensity to save) in the model.  Section 2 
compares and constrasts the   different closures and results of the Sraffian supermultiplier model with the 
Cambridge and the kaleckian growth models.  Section 3 contains brief final remarks.  
 

1.  The Sraffian Supermultiplier Growth Model 

1.1. The supermultiplier and the long period position 

 

We  shall  present  the  Sraffian  supermultiplier  growth  model  in  its  simplest  possible  form  in  order  to 
facilitate  the  identification  of  the  most  relevant  properties  of  the  model  and  the  comparison  with 
alternative growth models. Hence, we assume a closed capitalist economy without a government sector. 
The only method  of production in  use requires a fixed combination of  a  homogeneous labor input  with 
homogeneous fixed capital to produce a single homogeneous output. Natural resources are supposed to be 
abundant; we assume constant returns to scale and no technological progress. We also assume that growth 
is  not  constrained  by  labor  scarcity.  Moreover,  all  variables  are  measured  in  real  terms  and  output, 
income,  profits,  investment  and  savings  are  all  presented  in  gross  terms.  The  formal  analysis  will  use 
continuous time for mathematical convenience. 

In  this  very  simple  analytical  context,  the  level  of  capacity  output  of  the  economy  depends  on 

level of the capital stock and on the technical capital/output ratio according to the following expression: 

𝑌𝐾𝑡 = (

1
𝑣

) 𝐾𝑡 

(1) 

where 𝑌𝐾𝑡 is the level of the capacity output of the economy,  𝐾𝑡 is the level of capital stock installed in 
the  economy  and  𝑣  is  the  technical  capital/output  ratio.  Since  𝑣  is  given,  then  the  rate  of  growth  of 
capacity output is equal to the rate of capital accumulation  

 

2 

𝑔𝐾𝑡 = (

𝐼𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄

𝑣

) 𝑢𝑡 − 𝛿 

(2) 

where 𝑔𝐾𝑡 is rate of capital accumulation, 𝑢𝑡 = 𝑌𝑡 𝑌𝐾𝑡⁄
 is the actual degree of capacity utilization defined 
as the ratio of the current level of aggregate output (𝑌𝑡) to the current level of capacity output; 𝐼𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄  is the 
investment share in aggregate output defined as the ratio of gross aggregate investment (𝐼𝑡) to the level of 
gross aggregate output; and 𝛿 is exogenously given depreciation rate of the capital stock.1 According to 
equation (2) the rate of capital accumulation depends on the actual degree of capacity utilization and on 
the  investment  share.2  Given  the  capital/output  ratio,  the  change  in  the  actual  degree  of  capacity 
utilization through time is then described by the difference between the rate of growth of output and the 
rate of capital accumulation following the differential equation below: 

𝑢̇ = 𝑢𝑡(𝑔𝑡 − 𝑔𝐾𝑡) 

(3) 

where 𝑔𝑡 is the rate of growth of aggregate output.  

Aggregate  income  in  the  model  is  distributed  as  wages  and  gross  profits.  We  shall  assume  that 
besides the single technique in use, income distribution (either the normal real wage or the normal rate of 
profits)  is  also  given  exogenously  along  classical  (Sraffian)  lines.  We  accordingly  assume  that  there  is 
free  competition  and  that  output  (but  not  capacity)  adjusts  fairly  quickly  to  effective  demand  such  that 
that  market  prices  are  equal  to  normal  prices  that  yield  a  uniform  rate  of  profits  on  capital  using  the 
dominant  technique  when  the  actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization 𝑢𝑡  is  equal  to  the  normal  or  planned 
degree 𝜇.3 Note that we can make the assumption of normal prices at this stage of our analysis even when 
dealing with situations in which  the actual degree of capacity utilization can be quite different from the 
normal  or  planned  degree;  for  under  classical  competition,  individual  firms  do  not  have  the  power  to 
sustain  higher-than-normal  market  prices  when  the  actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization  of  a  particular 
firm is below (or very much above) the normal level and their actual unit costs are higher than normal.4 
Indeed,  at  higher  than  normal  prices  other  firms  already  in  the  market  may  be  operating  at  the  planned 
degree of utilization and can easily increase their market shares by undercutting the firms that have raised 
prices above the normal price. Moreover, these higher prices may also attract new entrants to the market 
which  would  also  be  able  to  operate  their  appropriately  sized  new  capacities  at  the  planned  degree  of 
utilization and reap higher than normal profits by undercutting incumbent firms that have raised prices to 
pass along their higher than normal actual average costs to market prices. Thus, both actual competition 
of existing firms as well as potential competition of new firms would ensure that effective demand will be 
met at the normal price even if the actual degree of capacity utilization is quite different from the normal 
or planned degree.5 

Since  we  are  assuming  that  output  adapts  quickly  to  demand,  when  normal  prices  prevail 
aggregate  demand  determines  the  level  of  output.  Effective  demand  is  composed  of  real  aggregate 
consumption  and  gross  real  aggregate  investment.  We  suppose  that  aggregate  consumption  has  an 
induced component and an autonomous one. The former is related to the purchasing power introduced to 
the  economy  by  the  production  decisions  of  capitalist  firms  when  they  pay  wages.  Given  consumption 
habits (i.e., a given marginal propensity to consume out of wages, 𝑐𝑤) and the wage share of output (𝜔), 
we  assume  that  there  is  a  positive  relationship  between  induced  consumption  and  aggregate  output 

)(𝑌𝐾𝑡 𝐾𝑡⁄ ) − 𝛿 = ((𝐼𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ ) 𝑣⁄ )𝑢𝑡 − 𝛿. 

                                                 
1 The equation of capital accumulation is derived from the equation  𝐼𝑡 = 𝐾̇ + 𝛿𝐾𝑡 that defines the level of aggregate gross fixed investment. Dividing both 
sides  of  the  equation  by  𝐾𝑡  we  obtain  𝐼𝑡 𝐾𝑡⁄ = 𝑔𝐾𝑡 + 𝛿.  Solving  this  last  equation  for  the  rate  of  capital  accumulation  gives  us  𝑔𝐾𝑡 = (𝐼𝑡 𝐾𝑡⁄ ) − 𝛿 =
(𝐼𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ )(𝑌𝑡 𝑌𝐾𝑡⁄
2 The logic underlying this equation appears to have first been outlined by Garegnani (1962). In his SVIMEZ report, Garegnani argued that what raises the rate 
of growth of capacity output is a rise in the investment share in  capacity output rather than in actual output. He furthermore noted that these two ratios can 
differ substantially from one another if the actual degree of capacity utilization can diverge from the normal or planned degree.  
3  Following  Ciccone  (1986,  1987),  we  interpret  the  normal  or  planned  degree  of  capacity  utilization  as determined,  among  other  things,  by  the  historically 
‘normal’ ratio of average to peak demand. This latter ratio, because it is presumably based on the observation of the actual cyclical pattern of the market over a 
very long period of time, is assumed to be unaffected by current oscillations of demand. 
4 If the actual degree of utilization is below the normal degree, fixed cost per unit of output will be higher than normal. If the degree of utilization is just above 
the normal degree unit costs will keep falling (giving rise, at normal prices, to extra profits) until at capacity utilization rates substantially above normal, the 
cost will begin to rise due to the extra expenses involved in operating capacity way above its cost minimizing range (Ciccone 1987). 
5  Normal  price  is  thus  a  kind  of  entry-preventing  ‘limit  price’  in  the  language  of  the  old  industrial  organization  literature.  Some  Sraffians  make  the  same 
argument in terms of a presumption of a uniformity of expected rates of profit on new investment (Garegnani 1992; Ciccone 1986, 2011).

regulated  by  the  marginal  propensity  to  consume  out  of  income  𝑐 = 𝑐𝑤𝜔  (with  0 < 𝑐 < 1,  since  0 <
𝑐𝑤 ≤ 1  and  0 < 𝜔 < 1).  In  order  to  simplify  the  analysis  of  the  model,  we  suppose  that  all  wages  are 
expended in consumption (i.e. 𝑐𝑤 = 1 and, hence, 𝑐 = 𝜔). On the other hand, the autonomous component 
𝑍𝑡 is that part of aggregate consumption financed by credit and, therefore, unrelated to the current level of 
output resulting from firms’ production decisions.   

We  further  assume  that  firms  undertake  all  investment  expenditures  in  the  economy  (i.e.,  we 
abstract from residential investment) and that the level of aggregate investment is an induced expenditure 
according to the following expression 

𝐼𝑡 = ℎ𝑌𝑡 

(4) 

where ℎ (with 0 ≤ ℎ < 1) is the marginal propensity to invest of firms, which we provisionally assume to 
be determined exogenously. 

Since we are thinking of a demand-led system, we assume that the marginal propensity to spend 
𝑐 + ℎ is strictly lower than one (if it was equal to one, Say’s Law would obtain).6 We must also assume 
that there is a positive level of autonomous consumption, otherwise no positive level of output could be 
profitably sold. 

The demand-determined level of output in a long-period position is: 

𝑌𝑡 = (

1

𝑠 − ℎ

) 𝑍𝑡 

(5) 

where 𝑠 = 1 − 𝜔 is the given aggregate marginal propensity to save and the term within the parenthesis is 
the  supermultiplier  that  captures  the  effects  on  the  level  of  output  associated  with  both  induced 
consumption and investment.7 

Given  the  existence  of  autonomous  consumption  expenditures,  we  have  that  the  marginal 
propensity  to  save  does  not  determine  the  actual  saving  ratio  (the  average  propensity  to  save)  in  this 
simple framework. The  saving ratio is  instead  determined by  and is  equal to the marginal propensity to 
invest: 

𝑆𝑡
𝑌𝑡

= 𝑠 −

𝑍𝑡
𝑌𝑡

= 𝑠𝑓 =

𝐼𝑡
𝑌𝑡

= ℎ 

(

(6) 

 

⁄

where 𝑓𝑡 = 𝐼𝑡 (𝐼𝑡 + 𝑍𝑡)
is what Serrano (1995b) called ‘the fraction’, the ratio between the average and 
the marginal propensities to save 𝑓𝑡 = (𝑆𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ )/𝑠.8 With positive levels of autonomous consumption (i.e., 
𝑍𝑡 > 0),  it  follows  that  𝑓𝑡 < 1  and 𝑆𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ < 𝑠.  Therefore,  the  given  marginal  propensity  to  save  defines 
only  the  upper  limit  to  the  value  of  the  saving  ratio  of  the  economy  corresponding  to  a  given  marginal 
propensity to save. In this case, the saving ratio depends not only on the marginal propensity to save but 
also on the proportion between autonomous consumption and investment. Thus, an increase (decrease) in 
the levels of aggregate investment in relation to autonomous consumption leads to an increase (decrease) 
in the saving ratio. As a result, the existence of a positive level of autonomous consumption is sufficient 
to make the saving ratio an endogenous variable. 

In  this  context,  for  a  given  level  of  income  distribution  (and  consumption  habits)  and,  hence,  a 
given  marginal  propensity  to  save,  the  given  marginal  propensity  to  invest ℎ  (equal  to  the  investment 
share  of  output)  uniquely  determines  the  saving  ratio  of  the  economy.  Hence,  an  exogenous  increase 

                                                 
6Neo-Kaleckians call this assumption ‘Keynesian stability’ (see, for example, Lavoie, 2014; Allain 2014). But in fact it is much more than that. It is actually 
what we mean when we say that output is demand-determined. For if the marginal propensity to spend were equal to one and there no autonomous demand we 
would have Say’s Law and if the marginal propensity to spend was lower than one but with no autonomous demand the economy would collapse and output 
would  fall  to  zero  (see  Serrano  1995a;  López  and  Assous  2010,  chapter  2).  Neo-Kaleckians  like  to  distinguish  such  ‘Keynesian  stability’  from  ‘Harrodian 
instability’  due  to  induced  investment  accelerator  effects.  This  distinction  is  much  less  useful  than  it  may  appear  to  be,  for  as  we  shall  see  the  latter  type 
stability also depends crucially on the aggregate marginal propensity to spend being lower than one when the economy is in the vicinity of the equilibrium 
position. 
7  On  the  marginal  propensity  to  consume,  see  Serrano  (1995a);  on  the  (not  fully  adjusted)  long-period  supermultiplier  with  a  given  marginal  propensity  to 
invest, see  Cesaratto, Serrano and Stirati (2003). Note that equation (5) can determine the level of output only if ut < 1. So for all t > 0 we must have YKt  > Yt 
= [1/(s – h)]Zt and, therefore, Zt < [ (s – h)/v]Kt.. That is, the level of output determined by effective demand is restricted by the level of capacity output for 
given values of s, h and v.  
8 According to (6), if there were no autonomous consumption (i.e., 𝑍𝑡 = 0) then 𝑓𝑡 = 1 and 𝑆𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ = 𝑠. That is, the marginal propensity to save determines the 
savings  ratio.  Note  also  that,  in  this  extreme  case  the  equilibrium  between  aggregate  demand  and  aggregate  output  with  a  given  income  distribution  also 
implies the endogenous determination of the investment share of output by the marginal propensity to save.

(decrease)  in  the  investment  share  of  output  in  relation  to  the  marginal  propensity  to  save  would  raise 
(reduce)  the  fraction  𝑓,  and,  therefore,  would  cause  a  decrease  (increase)  in  the  ratio  of  autonomous 
consumption to output 𝑍𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ and an increase (decrease) in the saving ratio. 

Now  let  us  suppose  that  autonomous  consumption  grows  at  an  exogenously  determined  rate 
𝑔𝑍 > 0.  Since  the  marginal  propensities  to  consume  and  to  invest  are  given  exogenously,  the 
supermultiplier  is  also  exogenous  and  constant.  Therefore,  aggregate  output,  induced  consumption  and 
investment grow at the same rate as autonomous consumption. The capital stock also tends to grow at this 
same rate since the growth rate of gross investment governs its trend rate of growth.9 Thus, starting from 
any  given  investment  share  of  output ℎ,  if  initially  the  growth  of  demand  is  equal  to  the  growth  of  the 
capital stock, the actual degree of utilization will remain constant over time. On the other hand, if initially 
the rate of growth of demand is higher (lower) than the rate of growth of the capital stock then the growth 
of the capital stock will increase (decrease) towards the rate of growth of demand (since a given h implies 
that gross investment is  growing at the same rate as demand).  In the context of our model with  a given 
marginal  propensity  to  invest,  this  implies  that  capacity  output  tends  to  grow  at  the  same  rate  as 
autonomous consumption. Moreover, the actual degree of capacity utilization will tend to a constant value 
as can be calculated from equation (3) above and its trend level can be determined using equation (2) as 
follows:10 

𝑢∗ =

𝑣(𝑔𝑍 + 𝛿)
 

ℎ

(

(7) 

According to equation (7) above, given the marginal propensity to invest h, a higher (lower) rate 
of  growth  of  autonomous  consumption  leads  to  a  permanently  higher  (lower)  actual  degree  of  capacity 
utilization.  Moreover,  for  any  exogenously  given  marginal  propensity  to  invest,  there  is  no  reason  why 
the  actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization  should  tend  to  its  normal  or  planned  level.  Therefore,  in  this 
simplified  long-period  supermultiplier  model,  the  growth  of  productive  capacity  follows  the  growth  of 
(autonomous  consumption)  demand,  but  the  level  of  capacity  may  be  quite  different  from  the  level  of 
aggregate demand. 

1.2.  The fully adjusted positions and the supermultiplier 

Let us now move on to the analysis of the slower, but always present, competitive tendency of capacity to 
adjust  to  demand.  From  what  we  saw  above  (equation  (7)),  we  know  that  given  the  growth  rate  of 
autonomous consumption, a higher (lower) propensity to invest will lead to a permanently lower (higher) 
actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization.  Therefore,  changes  of  the  marginal  propensity  to  invest  would 
appear  in  principle  to  allow  the  adjustment  of  the  actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization  to  its  normal  or 
planned level. 

In order to analyze the adjustment of capacity to demand we now add to the model a rule for the 
changes of the marginal propensity to invest. We will use the simplest possible (and yet not unreasonable) 
rule. We will assume that the process of inter-capitalist competition will lead to a tendency for the growth 
rate  of  aggregate  investment  to  be  higher  than  the  rate  of  growth  of  demand  (and  hence  of  output) 
whenever  the  actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization  is  above  its  normal  or  planned  level  and  vice-versa. 
Competition would ensure that firms as a whole will be pressed to invest in order to ensure they can meet 
future  peaks  of  demand  when  the  degree  of  utilization  is  above  the  normal  or  planned  degree  and  the 
margins  of  spare  capacity  are  getting  too  low.  Conversely,  firms  will  not  want  to  keep  accumulating 
costly  unneeded  spare  capacity  when  the  actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization  remains  below  the 
profitable normal or planned level. 

We  shall  also  assume  that  such  endogenous  changes  in  the  marginal  propensity  to  invest  are 
gradual  rather  than  drastic  and  therefore  compatible  with  the  view  expressed  in  the  principle  of  the 
                                                 
9The fact that the rate of growth of the stock of capital follows the rate of growth of gross investment can be shown as follows. From the definitional equation 
𝐼𝑡 = 𝐾̇ + 𝛿𝐾𝑡  we  can  obtain  the  differential  equation  𝑔̇𝐾 = (𝑔𝐾𝑡 + 𝛿)(𝑔𝐼𝑡 − 𝑔𝐾𝑡)  relating  the  rate  of  growth  of  the  flow  of  gross  investment  to  the  rate  of 
capital  accumulation.    From this  differential  equation  it  can be  seen  that, if  initially  the  rate  of  capital  accumulation is  different  from the  rate  of  growth  of 
investment, the rate of capital accumulation begins to move towards the rate at which investment grows. We can also see that the rate of capital accumulation 
only constant when it becomes equal to the given rate of growth of gross investment.  
10  From  equation  (2)  we  can  write  the  actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization  as  𝑢𝑡 = 𝑣(𝑔𝐾𝑡 + 𝛿) ℎ⁄ .  But  since  𝑔𝐾𝑡  converges  to  𝑔𝑍,  the  actual  degree  of 
utilization tends to the value described in equation(7).

adjustment of the capital stock associated with flexible accelerator models of induced investment. Thus, in 
our version of the flexible accelerator investment  function the marginal propensity to invest changes as 
follows:11 

ℎ̇ = ℎ𝑡𝛾(𝑢𝑡 − 𝜇) 

(

(8) 

where  𝜇 is  the normal  degree of  capacity  utilization discussed  above  (with 0 < 𝜇 < 1), and  𝛾 > 0  is  a 
parameter  that  measures  the  reaction  of  the  growth  rate  of  the  marginal  propensity  to  invest  to  the 
deviation  of  the  actual  degree  of  utilization 𝑢𝑡  from  the  normal  or  planned  level  𝜇.  From  equations  (4) 
and (8) we can see that the growth rate of investment 𝑔𝐼𝑡 is then given by the following expression: 

𝑔𝐼𝑡 = 𝑔𝑡 + 𝛾(𝑢𝑡 − 𝜇) 

(

(9) 

Given  our  investment  function  we  can  obtain  the  following  equation  for  the  growth  rates  of 

aggregate output/demand:12 

𝑔𝑡 = 𝑔𝑍 +

ℎ𝑡𝛾(𝑢𝑡 − 𝜇)
 

𝑠 − ℎ𝑡

(

(10) 

Equation (10) shows that when the actual and normal degrees of capacity utilization are different, the rate 
of growth of output and demand is determined by the rate of expansion of autonomous consumption plus 
the rate of change of the supermultiplier given by the second term on the right-hand side of the equation.  
Let  us  now  substitute  equations  (10)  and  (2)  into  equation  (3).  From  the  combination  of  the 
resulting equation and equation (8) we obtain a system of two first order nonlinear differential equations 
in  two  variables,  the  share  of  investment  h  and  the  actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization  u,  which  we 
present below:  

ℎ̇ = ℎ𝑡𝛾(𝑢𝑡 − 𝜇)

We will use the above system to develop the analysis of our fully adjusted version of the supermultiplier 
growth model. 

1.2.1.   The Fully Adjusted equilibrium 

The  equality  between  actual  and  normal  degrees  of  capacity  utilization  characterizes  the  fully  adjusted 
position of the economy according to the supermultiplier model. Setting 𝑢𝑡 = 𝑢∗ = 𝜇 in equation (8) we 
obtain ℎ̇ = 0, and since 𝜇 is constant we also have 𝑢̇ = 0. Thus, if 𝑢𝑡 = 𝑢∗ = 𝜇 then ℎ̇ = 𝑢̇ = 0 and we 
can verify that the fully  adjusted position is  an equilibrium of the supermultiplier model represented by 
the system comprising equations (8) and (11). 

From  equations  (9)  and  (10)  we  can  also  verify  that  in  the  fully  adjusted  position  of  the 
supermultiplier model the growth rates of output, demand and investment are equal to the growth rate of 
autonomous consumption. Moreover, since 𝑢̇ = 0 and 𝜇 > 0 then, from equation (3), the rate of capital 
∗ =
accumulation  is  equal  to the  growth rate of output.  Hence, in  the fully  adjusted position we have 𝑔𝐾
∗ = 𝑔∗ = 𝑔𝑍.  That  is,  the  growth  rate  of  autonomous  consumption  determines  the  equilibrium  growth 
𝑔𝐼
rates of  the capital  stock, investment and output  and demand. The model generates  an equilibrium  path 
where economic growth is consumption-led and normal utilization of productive capacity prevails. 

                                                 
11 On the flexible accelerator investment function see Goodwin (1951), Chenery (1952) and Koyck (1954). We have elsewhere explored other specifications of 
a flexible accelerator induced investment function; see Cesaratto, Serrano and Stirati (2003), Serrano and Wilcox (2000), Serrano (2007), Serrano and Freitas 
(2007)  and  Freitas  and  Dweck  (2010).  The  particular  function  used  here  was  chosen  as  the  simplest  for  the  purpose  at  hand,  i.e.  the  elucidation  of  the 
adjustment  of  capacity  to  demand;  but  the  essential  features  of  the  stability  conditions  discussed  below  are  basically  the  same  for  all  these  variants  of  the 
induced investment function. 
12 The equation is deduced as follows. Taking the time derivatives of the endogenous variables involved in expression 𝑌𝑡 = 𝑍𝑡 + 𝑐𝑌𝑡 + ℎ𝑡𝑌𝑡 and dividing both 
sides of the resulting equation by the level of aggregate output, we obtain 𝑔𝑡 = 𝑐𝑔𝑡 + ℎ𝑡𝑔𝑡 + ℎ̇ + (𝑍𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ )𝑔𝑍. If 𝑍𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ = 𝑠 − ℎ𝑡 > 0, then we can solve the last 
equation for the rate of growth of aggregate output and demand, obtaining 𝑔𝑡 = 𝑔𝑍 + ℎ̇ (𝑠 − ℎ𝑡)
. Finally, we can substitute the right-hand side of equation (8) 
in the second term on the right-hand side of the last equation, which gives us equation (10).

The last result shows that, according to the model, the growth of autonomous consumption drives 
the  pace  of  capital  accumulation  and,  therefore,  the  growth  of  productive  capacity.  Thus  it  is  able  to 
represent a sustainable process of demand-led growth. Such a result is compatible with the maintenance 
of  a  normal  or  planned  degree  of  capacity  utilization  throughout  the  equilibrium  path  because  the 
investment share of output (i.e., the marginal propensity to invest) assumes a required value h* given by: 

 

ℎ∗ =

𝑣
𝜇

(𝑔𝑍 + 𝛿) 

(

(12) 

The required investment share is uniquely determined by the rate of growth of autonomous consumption, 
the technical capital/output ratio, the normal degree of capacity utilization and the rate of depreciation.  

The  maintenance  of  the  equilibrium  between  aggregate  output  and  demand  in  the  fully  adjusted 
position of the model requires the endogenous determination of the saving ratio (or average propensity to 
save). As we mentioned above, the endogeneity of the saving ratio in the model is a consequence of the 
hypothesis of the existence of a positive level of autonomous consumption. Actually, the latter makes it 
possible for the fraction  𝑓𝑡 = ℎ𝑡 𝑠⁄  to  change its value  according to  the modifications of the investment 
share  of  output.  As  a  result,  𝑍𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ = 𝑠(1 − 𝑓𝑡) = 𝑠 − ℎ𝑡,  the  ratio  of  autonomous  consumption  to 
aggregate output can change, making the saving ratio an endogenous variable and allowing its adjustment 
to the investment share of output. In fact,  along the equilibrium path of the model, once the investment 
share  is  determined  we  can  obtain  the  equilibrium  values  of  the  fraction,  of  the  aggregate  autonomous 
consumption/output ratio and, accordingly, of the equilibrium value of the saving ratio as follows

We saw that the equilibrium investment share of output is positively related to the equilibrium rate 
of  growth  of  output.  Thus,  given  income  distribution  (and,  therefore,  the  marginal  propensity  to  save), 
according to equations (13), (14) and (15), a higher (lower) equilibrium rate of economic growth entails, 
on  the  one  hand,  higher  (lower)  equilibrium  values  of  the  fraction  and  of  the  saving  ratio,  and,  on  the 
other, a lower (higher) equilibrium value of the autonomous consumption/output ratio. 

Finally, by introducing the required level of the investment share h* in equation (5) we obtain the 

fully adjusted (final equilibrium) level of output:

Equation (16) shows that at each moment 𝑡 the level of autonomous consumption and the fully adjusted 
(final equilibrium) level of the supermultiplier (the term in parenthesis) determine the levels of output of 
the  fully  adjusted  positions  (final  equilibria)  towards  which  the  economy  is  slowly  gravitating.13  Thus, 
contrasting with the situation represented by the model in the long-period position, in the fully adjusted 
positions not only aggregate output but also the levels of capacity output and the capital stock adjust to 
the levels of aggregate demand. 

                                                 
13  In terms of the old  long-period method the fully adjusted position is thus a classical ‘secular’ rather than a long-period position (Ciccone  1986) just as a 
Solow  steady  state  is  a  secular  not  a  long-period  neoclassical  equilibrium  path.  In  the  terms  of  the  recent  neo-Kaleckian  literature  the  fully  adjusted 
equilibrium is a type of ‘final equilibrium’ and the long-period position would be a ‘medium- run equilibrium’ (see Lavoie 2014).

1.2.2.  The tendency towards the Fully Adjusted Position 

Let  us  now  look  at  the  stability  of  the  fully  adjusted  position  to  see  if  the  long-period  positions  of  the 
economy tend to move towards it. There are two conditions for this process of adjustment to occur. First, 
the investment share of output must be susceptible to change via the influence of the competitive process 
over capitalist investment decisions. This is guaranteed by the existence of an autonomous consumption 
component  of  aggregate  demand,  which  allows  the  proper  adjustment  of  the  saving  ratio.  In  fact,  from 
equations (9) and (10) we can obtain the following relations: 

𝑔𝐼𝑡 ⋛ 𝑔𝑡 ⋛ 𝑔𝑍 as 𝑢𝑡 ⋛ 𝜇 

 

According  to  them,  if  the  actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization  is  above  (below)  the  normal  level  the 
marginal propensity to invest increases (decreases). At the same time, the saving ratio (𝑆𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ = 𝑠𝑓𝑡) also 
increases  (decreases)  because  the  growth  rate  of  investment  is  higher  (lower)  than  the  growth  rate  of 
autonomous  consumption  and,  therefore,  the  fraction  𝑓𝑡 = 𝐼𝑡 (𝐼𝑡 + 𝑍𝑡)
  increases  (decreases)  while  the 
marginal  propensity to  save is  constant. These changes in  the investment  share of output  in  response to 
deviations from the normal degree of capacity utilization are necessary for the  adjustment of capacity to 
demand  and  the  corresponding  tendency  towards  a  fully  adjusted  position  of  the  model.  However,  they 
are not sufficient to assure such a result since the intensity of the adjustment must also be considered. The 
latter point leads us to the condition discussed below. 

⁄

The second condition is that the marginal propensity to invest changes gradually as a response to 
deviations of capacity utilization from its planned degree. The latter is required to assure that the value of 
the  marginal  propensity  to  spend  remains  lower  than  one  throughout  the  process  of  convergence  to  the 
fully  adjusted  position.  The  reason  for  that  is  quite  simple.  Given  that  empirically  it  is  plausible  that 
normal technical capital/output ratios for fixed capital tend to be greater than one, an immediate and full 
reaction of induced investment that tried to adjust capacity fully and immediately to any current deviation 
from  normal  utilization  (what  is  known  as  a  ‘rigid  accelerator’)  would  certainly  lead  to  a  marginal 
propensity  to  invest  greater  than  one.  Since  the  marginal  propensity  to  consume  is  positive,  the  overall 
marginal  propensity  to  spend  in  the  vicinity  of  the  fully  adjusted  position  would  be  much  greater  than 
one, implying that any positive level of autonomous expenditure would endogenously generate an infinite 
demand  stimulus,  and  any  fall  in  output  would  induce  the  collapse  of  the  economy.  Such  drastic 
adjustment however is highly unrealistic, both because of the durability of fixed capital (which means that 
producers want normal utilization only on average over the life of equipment and not at every moment) 
and also because producers know that demand fluctuates a good deal and therefore do not interpret every 
fluctuation in demand as indicative of a lasting change in the trend of demand.14 The precise meaning of 
this  second  sufficient  condition  is  that the aggregate marginal propensity to  spend in  the vicinity  of the 
fully adjusted position must be lower than one (see Freitas & Serrano (2015) for the proof). Therefore we 
assume that:  

𝑐 +

(𝑔𝑍 + 𝛿) + 𝛾𝑣 < 1

equilibrium propensity to spend (𝑐 +

We  can  interpret  (17)  as  an  expanded  marginal  propensity  to  spend  that  besides  the  final 
(𝑔𝑍 + 𝛿)) includes also a term (i.e., 𝛾𝑣) related to the behavior of 
induced  investment  outside  the  fully  adjusted  position.  The  extra  adjustment  term  captures  the  fact  that 
the  investment  function  of  the  model  is  grounded  in  the  capital  stock  adjustment  principle  (a  type  of 
flexible accelerator investment function) and that outside the fully adjusted trend path there must be room 
not only for the induced gross investment necessary for the economy to grow at its final equilibrium rate 
𝑔𝑍, but also for the extra induced investment responsible for adjusting capacity to demand. Thus,  ceteris 
paribus, for a sufficiently low value of the reaction parameter 𝛾 the system described above is stable.

1.2.3 Effects of changes in the rate of growth of autonomous consumption and in income 
distribution 
 

We  can  now  analyze  the  impact  on  the  fully  adjusted  (final  equilibrium)  positions  of  changes  in  the 
growth  rate  of  autonomous  consumption  (i.e.,  𝑔𝑍)  and  in  income  distribution  (i.e.  the  wage  share  𝜔), 
assuming that the fully adjusted equilibrium is stable both before and after the change.  

As  we  saw  above,  according  to  the  supermultiplier  growth  model,  the  rate  of  growth  of 
autonomous consumption determines the trend rate of growth of output/demand (i.e., 𝑔∗). So an increase 
(a decrease) in the rate of growth of autonomous consumption causes an increase (a decrease) in the trend 
rate of growth of output/demand. Therefore changes in 𝑔𝑍 have a growth effect on 𝑔∗. We also have seen 
∗ ). Hence a permanent 
that 𝑔𝑍 determines the value of the rate capital accumulation in equilibrium (i.e., 𝑔𝐾
∗ . Since, according to  the model, there is  a 
rise (fall) in  𝑔𝑍 causes a permanent  increase (decrease) in  𝑔𝐾
∗  
tendency for the economy to converge towards normal capacity utilization, this growth effect of 𝑔𝑍 on 𝑔𝐾
occurs  through  the  effect  of  𝑔𝑍  on  the  equilibrium  level  of  the  investment  share  of  output  (i.e.,  ℎ∗).  In 
fact, from Equation (12) we can see that the there is a positive relationship between 𝑔𝑍 and ℎ∗, such that a 
permanent increase (fall) in 𝑔𝑍 has a positive (negative) level effect on ℎ∗. Moreover, from Equations (13) 
to (15) we can observe that a rise (fall) in 𝑔𝑍 has, on the one hand, a positive (negative) level effect on the 
equilibrium value of the fraction (i.e., 𝑓∗) and on the equilibrium level of the saving ratio (i.e. (𝑆𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ )∗ =
𝑠𝑓∗)  and,  on  the  other,  a  negative  (positive)  level  effect  on  the  equilibrium  level  of  the  autonomous 
consumption  to  output  ratio  (i.e.,  (𝑍𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ )∗ = 𝑠(1 − 𝑓∗)).  Therefore,  the  supermultiplier  growth  model 
implies that there is a positive causal relationship running from the trend rate of growth of output/demand 
to the the investment share of output and the saving ratio. As argued above such a relationship is essential 
to  the obtainment of the distinctive results of the Supermultiplier  growth  model, according to  which an 
economy can be demand-led, while it mantains a tendency of the actual degree of capacity utilization to 
converge towards its normal level with a given income distribution. 

Now let us look at the effects of changes in income distribution. First, our analysis of the steady 
state  of  the  model  has  shown  that  the  equilibrium  rates  of  growth  of  output/demand  and  of  the  capital 
stock are independent from the value of the wage share. Hence, in the supermultiplier model there is no 
relationship between income distribution and the trend growth rate of output and demand. Next, since, as 
we just saw, a change in income distribution does not have a permanent growth effect, then equation (12) 
shows that a variation in income distribution does not have a permanent effect on the equilibrium value of 
the investment share of output. 

Nevertheless, although a change in income distribution does not have a permanent growth effect, 
such a change does have a  level  effect over the equilibrium values of all non-stationary variables  of the 
simplified  supermultiplier  growth  model  here  presented.  This  is  so  because  a  change  in  income 
distribution affects,  through its influence over the marginal propensity to save, the equilibrium value of 
the supermultiplier and, hence, the equilibrium value of aggregate output. So a change in the wage share 
has  wage  led  output  level  effect.  Indeed,  as  can  be  easily  verified,  an  increase  (decrease)  in  the  wage 
share  reduces  (raises)  the  marginal  propensity  to  save,  which  yields  an  increase  (a  decrease)  in  the 
equilibrium  value  of  the  supermultiplier  and,  accordingly,  an  increase  (a  decrease)  in  the  equilibrium 
level of output.15 

On the other hand, we know that, according to  the supermultplier growth model, the investment 
share  of  output  determines  the  saving  ratio.  Thus,  there  is  no  effect  of  a  modification  in  income 
distribution on the saving ratio also. Note, however, that a change in income distribution does affect the 
marginal propensity to save. In fact, since the latter variable is equal to the profit share (i.e. 𝑠 = 1 − 𝜔), 
an  increase  (decrease)  in  the  wage  share  would  reduce  (raise)  the  marginal  propensity  to  save  (i.e. 
𝑑𝑠 = −𝑑𝜔). But making use of equations (13) and (15) we can verify how this latter result is reconciled 
with  the  invariability  of  the  saving  ratio  in  relation  to  an  income  distribution  change.  Thus,  given  the 

                                                 
15 Note that, in this sense, the Supermultiplier growth model allows the extension of the validity of the paradox of thrift concerning the level 
of output to the context of analysis of the economic growth process.

value of the investment share of output, an increase (a decrease) in the marginal propensity to save leads 
to  a  fall  (an  increase)  in  the  level  of  output  that  causes  a  decrease  (an  increase)  in  the  fraction.    This 
explains why the saving ratio is unaffected by change in income distribution (since ℎ∗ = 𝑠𝑓∗). 

 

2.  A Comparison with other heterodox closures16 

 

In  this  section  we  shall  compare  the  main  results  obtained  in  our  discussion  of  the  Sraffian 
supermultiplier  growth  model  with  alternative  heterodox  growth  models  that  also  deal  with  the 
relationship between economic growth, income distribution and effective demand. More specifically, we 
will compare the supermultiplier, Cambridge and neo-Kaleckian growth models trying to point out their 
similarities and, more importantly, their main differences. The comparison will be made within the same 
simplified  analytical  context  used  in  the  discussion  of  the  supermultiplier  model.  Thus,  the  following 
assumptions  will  be  maintained:  we  have  a  closed  capitalist  economy  without  government;  aggregate 
income is distributed in the form of wages and profits; the method of production in use requires a fixed 
combination  of  homogeneous  labor  input  with  homogeneous  fixed  capital  to  produce  a  single  output; 
there  is  constant  returns  to  scale  and  no  technological  progress;  and  there  exists  a  permanent  labor 
surplus. Moreover, as occurred in the case of the supermultipier model, the alternative growth models will 
be presented in their simplest form in order to facilitate the comparisons and to draw our attention to the 
different theoretical closures provided by each model. 

2.1. Cambridge growth models 

Let  us  start  with  Cambridge  growth  models.  Maintaining  the  hypothesis  of  permanent  labor 
surplus, the version of the Cambridge growth model presented here17 supposes that the level of aggregate 
output is determined by the level of capacity output. So, contrary to the supermultiplier growth model, the 
equilibrium level of aggregate output is not determined by effective demand, but by the supply constraint 
associated with full utilization of productive capacity. That is, we have 

and thus 

𝑌𝑡 = 𝑌𝐾𝑡 =

1
𝑣

𝐾𝑡 

𝑢∗ = 1 

 

 

Also differently from the supermultiplier growth model, there is no autonomous consumption and, 
additionally  to  the  consumption  induced  by  the  wage  bill,  there  is  also  a  component  of  aggregate 
consumption  induced  by  total  current  profits.  We  retain  the  assumption  that  the  propensity  to  consume 
out of wages 𝑐𝑤 is equal to one (i.e., 𝑐𝑤 = 1) and suppose that the propensity to consume out of profits 𝑐𝜋 
is a positive constant and has a value lower than one (i.e., 0 < 𝑐𝜋 < 1). Thus the consumption function is 
given by the following expression 

𝐶𝑡 = (𝜔𝑡 + 𝑐𝜋(1 − 𝜔𝑡))𝑌𝑡 

 

where 𝜔𝑡 + 𝑐𝜋(1 − 𝜔𝑡) is the marginal propensity to consume, which is equal to the average propensity 
to consume since there is no autonomous component in the consumption function. Moreover, in contrast 
to the supermultiplier growth model, aggregate investment is an autonomous expenditure in this version 
of  the  Cambridge  model,  and  we  suppose,  for  the  sake  of  simplicity,  that  investment  expands  at  an 
                                                 
16This section is based on and confirms the main findings contained in the more general comparative analysis presented in Serrano (1995b, chapter 3). See also 
Serrano  and  Freitas  (2007),  for  an  early  discussion  of  the  main  differences  between  the  supermultiplier,  Cambridge  and  neo-Kaleckian  growth  models 
containing similar results to the ones here obtained.

exogenously determined rate 𝑔𝐼>0. From these hypotheses we obtain the aggregate demand equation of 
the Cambridge model 

𝐷𝑡 = (𝜔𝑡 + 𝑐𝜋(1 − 𝜔𝑡))𝑌𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 

 

Since  aggregate  output  is  determined  by  capacity  output,  the  equilibrium  between  aggregate 
demand  and  output  requires  that  the  former  adjusts  to  the  latter.  In  the  Cambridge  model  such  an 
adjustment involves a change in the marginal propensity to consume through the modification of income 
distribution  (i.e.,  of  the  wage  share).  Thus,  according  to  the  model,  a  situation  of  excess  aggregate 
demand  (supply)  raises  (reduces)  the  general  price  level  and,  with  a  relatively  rigid  nominal  wage,  it 
causes  a  decrease  (increase)  in  real  wages.  So,  given  labor  productivity,  the  excess  aggregate  demand 
(supply)  causes  a  reduction  (an  increase)  in  the  wage  share  𝜔  and,  since  0 < 𝑐𝜋 < 𝑐𝑤 = 1,  it  causes  a 
decline (rise) in the marginal propensity to consume. Therefore, the adjustment implies a tendency for the 
establishment of an equilibrium between aggregate demand and supply at the level of output capacity (i.e. 
the  level  of  potential  output),  which  in  equilibrium  determines  the  level  of  aggregate  demand.18  At  the 
same  time,  in  equilibrium  between  aggregate  demand  and  output  capacity  the  model  endogenously 
determines  the  income  distribution  between  wages  and  profits.  So,  in  the  Cambridge  model,  the 
determination  of  a  required  level  of  income  distribution  allows  the  adjustment  of  aggregate  demand  to 
potential  output,  while  in  the  supermultiplier  growth  model  it  is  the  appropriate  change  in  the  level  of 
aggregate output that explains the adjustment of aggregate output to the level of aggregate demand. 

Now,  in  equilibrium  between  aggregate  output  and  aggregate  demand,  we  have  𝑌𝑡 =

(𝜔∗ + 𝑐𝜋(1 − 𝜔∗))𝑌𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 and, thus 

∗ = 𝑠∗𝑌𝑡 = 𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔∗)𝑌𝑡 = 𝐼𝑡 
𝑆𝑡

 

where  𝑠𝜋 = 1 − 𝑐𝜋 is  the marginal propensity to save out  of  total  profits. The last  equation shows that, 
according  to  the  Cambridge  model,  aggregate  investment  determines  aggregate  (capacity)  savings, 
although, as we saw above, the level of potential output determines the level of real  aggregate demand. 
Furthermore,  dividing  both  sides  of  the  last  equation  by  the  level  of  aggregate  output,  we  have  an 
expression relating the saving ratio to the investment share of output as follows 

∗
)

𝑆𝑡
(
𝑌𝑡

= 𝑠∗ = 𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔∗) =

𝐼𝑡
𝑌𝑡

 

 

From the above equation we can see that in the Cambridge model the investment-output ratio determines 
the saving ratio 𝑠∗ = 𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔∗), a result shared with the supermultiplier growth model. But, since in the 
Cambridge  model  there  is  no  autonomous  consumption  component,  the  marginal  and  average 
propensities to save are equal to each other. Hence, the burden of the adjustment of the saving ratio to the 
investment  share  relies  on  required  modifications  in  the  marginal  propensity  to  save  and,  therefore,  on 
appropriate changes in income distribution. 

Let  us now discuss  the  determination of the equilibrium level  of the investment  share of output. 
From the assumption of full capacity utilization, the growth rate of output is given by the rate of capital 
accumulation (i.e., 𝑔𝑡 = 𝑔𝐾𝑡). Thus, if we have initially 𝑔𝐾𝑡 < 𝑔𝐼 (𝑔𝐾𝑡 > 𝑔𝐼), then we also have 𝑔𝑡 < 𝑔𝐼 
(𝑔𝑡 > 𝑔𝐼).  It  follows  that  the  investment  share  of  output  would  increase  (decrease)  and,  according  to 

                                                 
18Note  however  that  the  adjustment  mechanism  based  on  endogenous  modifications  of  income  distribution  only  guarantees  the  adjustment  of  aggregate 
demand to the level of potential output and not necessarily the adjustment of the  degree of capacity utilization to its full capacity level. As Kaldor (1955-6) 
argued  in  his  seminal  discussion  of  such  adjustment  mechanism,  the  latter  can  be  viewed  as  an  alternative  to  the  usual  Keynesian  adjustment  based  on 
variations of the level of aggregate output leading to the equilibrium between aggregate output and demand. In the present version of the Cambridge growth 
model, the maintenance of a full utilization of capacity resulting from the operation of the adjustment mechanism involving changes in income distributions is 
a consequence of the assumption that the binding supply constraint in the economy is the availability of capital. If the operative supply constraint were the full 
employment of the labor force, then the adjustment of aggregate demand to potential output based on endogenous changes in income distribution would not 
guarantee the full (or the normal) utilization of the available capital stock. In Kaldor’s full employment growth models (c.f. Kaldor, 1957, 1958 and 1962) the 
investment function is responsible for the adjustment of the degree of capacity utilization. For an analysis of this role of the investment functions in Kaldor’s 
full employment growth models see Freitas (2002, chapter 2; and 2009) and Palumbo (2009, pp. 343-345).

equation (2) and with the degree of capacity utilization constant, the rate of capital accumulation would 
increase  (decrease).  Eventually  this  type  of  adjustment  leads  to  the  convergence  of  the  rate  capital 
accumulation to the investment growth rate.19 Therefore in the equilibrium path of the model we have 

Substituting this last result in equation (2), solving for the investment share of output and recalling that 
𝑢∗ = 1, we have the equilibrium value of the investment share given by 

𝑔∗ = 𝑔𝐾

∗ = 𝑔𝐼

(

𝐼𝑡
𝑌𝑡

= 𝑣(𝑔𝐼 + 𝛿) 

 

Thus, according to  the Cambridge growth model, a higher (lower) rate of growth  of investment  implies 
higher (lower) equilibrium growth rates of capacity output and output. Moreover, with a constant capacity 
utilization rate, this result is possible because the equilibrium level of the investment share is positively 
related  to  the  growth  rate  of  investment  and,  therefore  to  the  equilibrium  growth  rates  of  output  and 
capacity  output.  This  last  result  is  shared  by  the  supermultiplier  growth  model  although  the  process  by 
which it is achieved is different from the process featured in the Cambridge growth model.  

It is important to note, however, that the growth determining role of investment in the Cambridge 
model follows from its effect on productive capacity and not from its influence on aggregate demand. As 
we  saw  above,  in  the  Cambridge  growth  model,  the  level  of  capacity  output  determines  the  level  of 
aggregate demand. Thus, a higher (lower) growth rate of investment only causes a higher (lower) rate of 
output  growth  because  it  raises  (reduces)  the  level  of  the  investment  share  of  output  and,  through  this 
way,  the  pace  of  capital  accumulation  and  the  growth  of  capacity  (or  potential)  output.  Therefore,  the 
Cambridge  model  displays,  in  fact,  a  supply  (capacity)  constrained  pattern  of  economic  growth,  and 
hence, it is not a demand-led growth model. 

Finally, we can substitute the expression for the equilibrium level  of the investment  share in  the 

equation relating the investment share and the saving ratio. Doing so we can obtain the following result  

(1 − 𝜔∗) =

𝑣(𝑔𝐼 + 𝛿)
 

𝑠π

(18). 

The last equation shows us the determinants of the required level of income distribution in the Cambridge 
model.  In  particular,  we  can  see  that,  given  𝑣,  𝛿  and  𝑠π,  a  higher  (lower)  growth  rate  yields  a  higher 
(lower) profit share of output. Thus, according to the Cambridge growth model and in contrast with the 
supermultiplier model, there exists a theoretically necessary relationship between income distribution and 
economic growth, the profit share of output (the wage share) is positively (negatively) related to the rate 
of economic growth. In the Cambridge model, such relationship is necessary for obtaining a growth path 
characterized by the equilibrium between aggregate demand and aggregate output with a constant degree 
of capacity utilization. Therefore, the closure provided by the Cambridge model requires the endogenous 
determination  of  an  appropriate  level  income  distribution,  which  must  be  compatible  with  various 
combinations of the values of the model’s exogenous variables and parameters.20 

                                                 
19 The adjustment process between the rate of capital accumulation and the expansion rate of investment can also be explained as follows. As we saw before, 
𝑔̇𝐾𝑡 = (𝑔𝐾𝑡 + 𝛿)(𝑔𝐼𝑡 − 𝑔𝐾𝑡), so, since 𝑔𝐼𝑡 = 𝑔𝐼, if initially −𝛿 < 𝑔𝐾0 ≠ 𝑔𝐼, then the capital accumulation rate would converge to the investment growth rate 
because from the last differential equation we can verify that 𝑔̇𝐾𝑡 ≷ 0 according to 𝑔𝐼𝑡 ≷ 𝑔𝐾𝑡.

2.2. Neo-Kaleckian growth models 

We  shall  now  compare  the  supermultiplier  and  the  neo-Kaleckian  growth  models.21  Like  in  the 
supermultiplier model, in the neo-Kaleckian growth model the level of aggregate demand determines the 
equilibrium level of aggregate output. Also, as occurs with the supermultiplier model, income distribution 
is  exogenously  determined  and,  therefore,  cannot  be  part  of  the  adjustment  mechanism  that  allows  the 
existence of the equilibrium path as in the Cambridge model. However, contrarily to the supermultiplier 
model,  aggregate  investment  is  autonomous  and  grows  at  an  exogenously  determined  growth  rate  𝑔𝐼 >
0,22 and also there is no autonomous component in aggregate consumption. In fact, in our representation 
of the basic neo-Kaleckian model we utilize the same specification for the consumption function used in 
the Cambridge model above. The only, but important, difference being that in the neo-Kaleckian model 
the wage share is exogenously determined and, accordingly, the marginal propensity to consume (equal to 
the average propensity to consume) is also an exogenous variable.  

With these hypotheses, aggregate demand is given by the following expression  

and in equilibrium between aggregate demand and output we have 

𝐷𝑡 = (𝜔 + 𝑐𝜋(1 − 𝜔))𝑌𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 

∗ = (

𝑌𝑡

1
) 𝐼𝑡 = (
𝑠

1

𝑠π(1 − 𝜔)

) 𝐼𝑡 

 

(19). 

According to  the last equation aggregate investment  is  the main determinant  of the equilibrium level  of 
output.  Further,  given  income  distribution  (i.e.  the  wage  share),  the  value  of  the  multiplier  1 𝑠⁄ =
1 (𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔))
⁄
is constant. Thus, in the neo-Kaleckian model, as can be verified from the last equation, 
the pace investment expansion determines the equilibrium output growth rate of the economy for a given 
level of income distribution. That is, we have 

𝑔∗ = 𝑔𝐼 

 

So  like  the  supermultiplier  growth  model,  the  neo-Kaleckian  model  produces  a  demand-led  growth 
pattern.  But  while  in  the  supermultiplier  model  we  have  a  consumption-led  growth  pattern,  the  neo-
Kaleckian model generates an investment-led growth pattern. 

From equation (19) we can also verify that  

∗ = 𝑠𝑌𝑡
𝑆𝑡

∗ = 𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔)𝑌𝑡

∗ = 𝐼𝑡 

and 

𝐼𝑡
∗ =
𝑌𝑡

∗
𝑆𝑡
∗ = 𝑠 = 𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔) 
𝑌𝑡

 

 

Thus, according to the first of the two equations above, the level aggregate savings adjusts to the level of 
aggregate investment through the variation of the level of aggregate output, the only endogenous variable 
in the equation. Note however that, as we can verify from the second equation above, given 𝑠𝜋 and 𝜔, the 
saving ratio, equal to the marginal propensity to save 𝑠, is exogenously determined and thus it determines 
the investment share of output in the neo-Kaleckian model. This feature of the model contrasts with the 
                                                 
21These models descend from Kalecki (1971) and Steindl (1952 and 1979) original contributions. The modern neo-Kaleckian model was presented originally 
by Dutt (1984) and Rowthorn (1981). See also Dutt (1990) and Lavoie (2014) for a formalization and comparison of the neo Kaleckian model with alternative 
growth models. For a detailed survey of the literature, see Blecker (2002). 
22Note that our presentation of the neo-Kaleckian model has some minor differences in relation to the usual presentation of these models. The main difference 
is that we specify the investment function in terms of the determinants of the investment growth rate, whilst the usual neo-Kaleckian specification is in terms 
of the determinants of the desired rate of capital accumulation. Observe that this difference doesn’t affect the equilibrium  values of the model’s endogenous 
∗ . 
∗ = 𝑔𝐾
variables  because,  since  by  definition  𝑔𝐼𝑡 = 𝑔𝐾𝑡 + 𝑔̇𝐾 (𝑔𝐾𝑡 + 𝛿)
Moreover, as we shall see shortly, our specification of the investment function doesn’t affect also the equilibrium stability condition. Therefore, we claim that 
nothing essential is altered by our specification of the investment function of the neo-Kaleckian model. 

  and  since,  in  equilibrium,  we  have  𝑔̇𝐾 = 0,  then  in  equilibrium  we  obtain  𝑔𝐼

related result obtained from the Cambridge and supermultiplier growth models. Indeed, as we pointed out 
before, in these latter models the investment share of output determines the saving ratio. In the Cambridge 
model  this  result  follows  from  changes  in  income  distribution  and  in  the  marginal  propensity  to  save, 
whilst in the supermultiplier growth model the same result follows from the existence of an autonomous 
component  in  aggregate  consumption  which  makes  the  saving  ratio  endogenous  even  though  income 
distribution  and  the  marginal  propensity  to  save  are  given  exogenously.  In  contrast,  the  neo-Kaleckian 
model  assumes  that  income  distribution  (and  thus  the  marginal  propensity  to  save)  is  exogenously 
determined and that there is no autonomous consumption component, which implies, in combination with 
the other assumptions of the model, the exogeneity of the saving ratio. 

Now,  since  the  saving  ratio  is  an  exogenous  variable  and  it  determines  the  investment  share  of 
output, then the latter variable cannot be changed according to the requirements of the pace of economic 
growth.  So,  in  contrast  with  the  supermultiplier  growth  model,  according  to  the  neo-Kaleckian  growth 
model, given income distribution, a change in the investment and output growth rates does not have any 
effect on the equilibrium value of the investment share of output. More importantly, from equation (2) we 
can verify that in the neo-Kaleckian model the rate of capital accumulation can only be reconciled with 
the output/demand growth rate if the degree of capacity utilization is properly adjusted. Indeed, since in 
the  neo-Kaleckian  model  the  saving  ratio  determines  the  investment  share  of  output,  then,  according  to 
equation (2), the rate of capital accumulation is given by 

𝑔𝐾𝑡 = (

𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔)

) 𝑢𝑡 − 𝛿 

 

𝑣

On the other hand, we saw that in the neo-Kaleckian model the growth rate of investment determines the 
equilibrium growth rate of output, so we have that 𝑔∗ = 𝑔𝐼. Thus, using these results in equation (3), we 
obtain the following differential equation for the dynamic adjustment of the degree of capacity utilization 

𝑢̇ = 𝑢𝑡 (𝑔𝐼 − (

) 𝑢𝑡 + 𝛿) 

(20) 

𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔)

𝑣

The  last  equation  shows  that  if  the  investment  growth  rate  is  higher  (lower)  than  the  rate  of  capital 
accumulation, then the degree of capacity utilization increases (declines) and this raises (reduces) the pace 
of capital accumulation. As a result, the capital accumulation rate converges to the investment growth rate 
through  changes  in  the  degree  of  capacity  utilization.  Therefore,  in  the  equilibrium  path  of  the  neo-
Kaleckian model we have 

∗ = 𝑔𝐼 = (
𝑔𝐾

𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔)

𝑣

) 𝑢∗ − 𝛿 

Now, solving the last equation for the equilibrium degree of capacity utilization we obtain 

𝑢∗ =

𝑣(𝑔𝐼 + 𝛿)
𝑠π(1 − 𝜔)

 

 

(21) 

Equation (21) shows the determinants  of the required  degree of capacity  utilization 𝑢∗ in  the simplified 
version of the neo-Kaleckian model here presented. This latter rate is the one that reconciles the rate of 
capital  accumulation  with  the  pace  of  economic  growth  and,  therefore,  allows  the  existence  of  an 
equilibrium growth path  in  the model. Observe that, in  its role as an adjusting variable, the equilibrium 
degree of capacity utilization has to able to assume any value between zero and one, however implausible 
it may be. Therefore the neo-Kaleckian model is not compatible with the related notions of planned spare 
capacity and normal (or desired) capacity utilization rate. Indeed, if we suppose the existence of a normal 
degree of capacity utilization, the closure provided by the model implies that it would be possible to have 
large and persistent deviations of the equilibrium degree of capacity utilization from its normal level and 

 

14 

also  that  such  divergence  would  not  have  any  repercussion  on  capitalist  investment  decisions.23  It  is 
important  to  be  remarked  that  the  required  long  run  endogeneity  of  the  equilibrium  degree  of  capacity 
utilization does not depend on the particular specification for the investment function adopted here, being 
in  fact  valid  for  all  the  usual  specifications  of  the  investment  function  in  neo-Kaleckian  models.24 
Actually, the necessity concerning the variability of the equilibrium degree of capacity utilization follows 
from  the  specification  of  the  consumption  function  and  not  from  the  particular  formulation  of  the 
investment function adopted in the model. As we argued above, it is the rigidity of the investment share 
of  output  implied  by  the  exogeneity  of  the  saving  ratio  that  leads  to  the  requirement  of  the  long  run 
variability of the equilibrium capacity utilization rate.  

∗ = (𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔) 𝑣⁄ )𝜇 − 𝛿. Now, if initially we have 𝑢0 = 𝜇 and 𝑔𝐼0 ≷ 𝑔𝐼

Further,  note  that  admitting  the  possibility  of  an  adjustment  of  the  actual  degree  of  capacity 
utilization to the normal one in the context of a neo-Kaleckian model only leads to an instability process 
of the Harrodian type.25 Indeed, suppose, following Skott (2008), that in trying to adjust the actual degree 
of capacity utilization to its normal level, capitalist firms change the investment growth rate according to 
𝑔̇𝐼 = 𝜂(𝑢𝑡 − 𝜇), 𝜂 > 0. Thus, in the equilibrium path of this particular model (i.e. with 𝑔̇𝐼 = 𝑢̇ = 0), we 
∗, then, 
would have 𝑢∗ = 𝜇 and 𝑔𝐼
according  to  equation (20), we would have 𝑢̇ ≷ 0, which implies that thereafter we would have  𝑢𝑡 ≷ 𝜇 
∗. So the equilibrium rate of growth would be unstable. Thus, according to 
and, hence, 𝑔̇𝐼 ≷ 0 and 𝑔𝐼𝑡 ≷ 𝑔𝐼
the neo-Kaleckian growth model, we would have a dilemma: either, on the one hand, we assume way the 
possibility of an adjustment of the actual degree of capacity utilization towards its normal level and admit 
the  possibility  of  obtaining  an  equilibrium  path  with  an  implausibly  high  or  low  equilibrium  degree  of 
capacity utilization or, on the other, we allow an adjustment of the actual to the normal degree of capacity 
utilization and obtain an unstable growth trajectory as we just saw. Observe, however, that the dilemma 
exists only if we restrict ourselves to the set of assumptions of the neo-Kaleckian model. In fact, once we 
admit the existence of an autonomous component in aggregate consumption the saving ratio becomes an 
endogenous variable and the investment share of output can change allowing the adjustment of the actual 
degree of capacity utilization to its normal level, as we have in the supermultiplier growth model.26 

Finally, we shall analyze the role of income distribution in the neo-Kaleckian growth model. Thus, 
in  the  very  simple  version  of  the  model  presented  here  there  is  no  relationship  between  the  pace  of 
economic  growth  and  the  level  of  functional  income  distribution.  Since  the  investment  growth  rate  is 
supposed to be an exogenous variable in the model, the equilibrium rate of output growth does not affect 
and is not affected by the level of the wage share of output. Nevertheless, a change in the wage share has 
a  level  effect  over  the  equilibrium  value  of  output  according  to  the  simple  neo-Kaleckian  model  under 
analysis.  In  fact,  an  increase  (decrease)  in  the  wage  share,  raises  (reduces)  the  value  of  the  multiplier 
1 (𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔))
⁄
 and, through it, such a change has a positive (negative) level effect on equilibrium output. 
These two latter results are shared with the supermultiplier growth model. On the other hand, in contrast 
with  the  latter  model,  from  equation  (21)  we  can  see  that,  in  the  neo-Kaleckian  model,  an  increase 
(decrease)  in  the  wage  share  leads  to  an  increase  (a  reduction)  in  the  equilibrium  degree  of  capacity 
utilization.  A  model  that  presents  this  type  of  result  is  classified  in  the  neo-Kaleckian  literature  as  a 
“stagnationist” or “wage led aggregate demand” model.27 

                                                 
23Compare equation (21) with the theoretical closure associated with the supermultiplier growth model as represented by equation (13) above. 
24For instance, the result under discussion is valid for the investment function given by equation (22) (below in the text). Indeed, the endogenous character of 
the equilibrium degree of capacity utilization and its implications are maintained as can be verified from equation (23) (below in the text) which is the equation 
that shows the determinants of the equilibrium degree of capacity utilization corresponding to the investment function represented by equation (22). The same 
point  is  valid  for  other  investment  functions  that  frequently  appear  in  the  neo-Keleckian  growth  literature  and,  in  particular,  it  is  valid  in  the  case  of  the 
investment function given by 𝑔𝐼𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽(𝑢𝑡 − 𝜇) with 𝛼,𝛽 > 0 and 𝜇 exogenous, Note that in the latter investment function the normal degree of capacity 
utilization appears as an argument. Nonetheless, the endogenous character of the equilibrium degree of capacity utilization is also maintained in this case and 
the corresponding value of the equilibrium rate is given by 𝑢∗ = (𝑣(𝛼 + 𝛿 − 𝛽𝜇)) (𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔) − 𝛽𝑣)
25In this connection, see Hein, Lavoie and van Treeck (2012) for a survey on Harrodian instability and the tendency for the normal capacity utilization rate in 
neo-Kaleckian growth models.

supermultiplier growth model presented in this paper.

We must say, however, that the independence between the pace of economic growth and income 
distribution in the simple version of the neo-Kaleckian model presented above is a direct consequence of 
the specific investment function adopted, which, as we saw, assumes the rate of investment growth to be 
completely exogenous. Indeed, if we consider the more usual formulations of the investment function in 
the neo-Kaleckian models, then we can obtain a causal relationship running from income distribution to 
the  pace  of  economic  expansion.  So  let  us  consider,  for  instance,  a  linear  version  of  the  investment 
function suggested by Marglin&Bhaduri (1990) and Bhaduri&Marglin (1990) 

𝑔𝐼𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑢𝑡 + 𝜌(1 − 𝜔) 

(22) 

where  𝛼 > 0  is  an  autonomous  component  of  the  investment  function,  𝛽 > 0  is  a  parameter  measuring 
the sensibility of the growth rate of investment to the capacity utilization rate, and 𝜌 > 0 is a parameter 
measuring the sensibility of the investment growth rate with respect to the profit share (i.e. (1 − 𝜔)). The 
introduction  of  an  induced  component  𝛽𝑢𝑡  in  the  investment  function  turns  the  investment  growth  rate 
into  an  endogenous  variable  of  the  model  thatpositively  depends  on  the  degree  of  capacity  utilization. 
With  such  specification  for  the  investment  function,  the  equilibrium  value  of  the  degree  of  capacity 
utilization is given by 

𝑢∗ =

𝑣(𝛼 + 𝛿 + 𝜌(1 − 𝜔))

𝑠π(1 − 𝜔) − 𝛽𝜐

 

(23) 

From the equation above we can see that an equilibrium with a positive value for the degree of capacity 
utilization  requires  that  𝛽 < 𝑠Π(1 − 𝜔) 𝑣⁄ .28  Also,  it  can  be  shown  that,  ceteris  paribus,  an  increase 
(decrease)  in  the  wage  share  raises  (reduces)  the  equilibrium  degree  of  capacity  utilization.29  Thus,  the 
model  still  is  classified  as  “stagnationist”  or  “wage  led  aggregate  demand”.  Now,  substituting  this  last 
result in the investment function, we obtain the equilibrium level of the investment growth rate as follows 

∗ = 𝛼 + 𝛽 (

𝑔𝐼

𝑣(𝛼 + 𝛿 + 𝜌(1 − 𝜔))

𝑠π(1 − 𝜔) − 𝛽𝜐

) + 𝜌(1 − 𝜔) 

 

Thus, since 𝑢∗ is positively related to the level of the wage share, then the effect of a change in the wage 
share  on  the  investment  growth  rate  can  be  either  positive  or  negative  according  to  the  value  of  the 
parameter 𝜌. As can be seen from the equation above, a higher value of the latter parameter reduces the 
positive  (and  indirect)  effect  of  a  change  of  the  wage  share  exerted  through  the  equilibrium  degree  of 
capacity utilization and increases the direct contribution of a change in the wage share through the third 
term on the RHS of the equation above. Hence, for a sufficiently  low value of 𝜌 the positive effect of a 
modification  in  the  wage  share  on  the  investment  growth  rate  through  the  capacity  utilization  rate 
dominates  the  direct  negative  effect  related  to  the  term  𝜌(1 − 𝜔).  In  this  case,  according  to  the  neo-
Kaleckian  literature,  the  model  would  produce  a  wage  led  growth  pattern.  On  the  other  hand,  for  a 
sufficiently high value of 𝜌 we would have the opposite situation and the model would generate a profit 
led pattern of economic growth.30 In both cases, a change in income distribution has a permanent growth

28 The inequality 𝛽 < 𝑠Π(1 − 𝜔) 𝑣⁄  is also necessary for the stability of the model. To see this, note that, in the case of the present version of the model, the 
equation 
by 
𝑢̇ = 𝑢𝑡(𝛼 + 𝛽𝑢𝑡 + 𝜌(1 − 𝜔) − (𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔) 𝑣⁄ )𝑢𝑡 + 𝛿) = 𝑢𝑡(𝛼 + 𝜌(1 − 𝜔) − ((𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔) 𝑣⁄ ) − 𝛽)𝑢𝑡 + 𝛿).  Observe  that  now  a  change  in  the  capacity 
utilization  rate  affects both  the  investment  growth  rate  and pace  of  capital  accumulation  in the  same direction. Thus, if  initially  the  investment  growth  rate 
were higher (lower) than the capital accumulation rate, then the capacity utilization rate would increase (decline). For its turn, this latter change would produce 
the  adjustment  between  investment  growth  and  capital  accumulation  rates  only  if  the  impact  of  a  change  in  the  capacity  utilization  rate  over  the  capital 
= 𝑠𝜋(1 − 𝜔) 𝑣⁄ > 𝛽 = 𝜕𝑔𝐼𝑡 𝜕𝑢𝑡
accumulation rate is greater than the impact of such a change on the pace of investment growth. That is, only if 𝜕𝑔𝐾𝑡 𝜕𝑢𝑡

which is the inequality mentioned above. 
29  Thus  taking  the  partial  derivative  of  𝑢∗  with  respect  to  𝜔  we  obtain  that  𝜕𝑢∗ 𝜕𝜔⁄

“stagnationist” or “wage  led aggregate demand” classification attributed to the model. Observe, however, that if a nonlinear specification of the investment 
function  were  adopted  then  it  would  be  possible,  according  to  neo-Kaleckian  literature,  to  obtain  a  negative  relationship  between  𝑢∗and  𝜔.  In  this  case, 
following the suggestion of Marglin and Bhaduri (1990), the model would be classified as “exhilarationist” (or “profit led aggregate demand”). See Blecker

effect. The existence of a relationship between economic growth and income distribution featured in the 
last version of the neo-Kaleckian model,  also  characterizes the Cambridge  growth model as we  saw.  In 
the  latter  model  there  is  an  inverse  relationship  between  the  wage  share  and  the  rate  of  output  growth, 
whereas  the  last  specification  of  the  neo-Kaleckian  model  admits  either,  a  positive  (in  the  wage  led 
growth  case)  or  a  negative  (in  the  profit  led  growth  case)  relationship  between  the  two  variables.  In 
contrast  with  these  results,  the  absence  of  any  permanent  relationship  between  income  distribution  and 
economic growth is an important feature of the supermultiplier growth model. 

2.3. General comparison  

Table 1 summarizes the principal results obtained from the above comparative analysis. The main 
conclusion that emerges from this analysis is that the supermultiplier growth model can be considered a 
true  heterodox  alternative  to  the  Cambridge  and  neo-Kaleckian  growth  models  in  the  analysis  of  the 
relationship  between economic growth, income distribution and effective  demand.  In this  sense, first of 
all, the supermultiplier growth model shows how is it possible for a heterodox growth model to obtain a 
tendency  towards  the  normal  utilization  of  productive  capacity  without  relying  on  the  endogenous 
determination  of  the  level  of  income  distribution  as  in  Cambridge  growth  model.  Thus,  the 
supermultiplier  model  does  not  impose  the  existence  of  any  necessary  a  priorirelationship  between 
income distribution and  economic  growth in  the  interpretation  of economic reality  and, therefore,  leave 
open the space for the determination of income distribution from outside the model by political, historical 
and economic factors not directly and necessarily related to the process of economic expansion. Secondly, 
the  model  also  shows  that  the  existence  of  a  stable  process  of  demand-led  growth  does  not  require  the 
endogenous determination of an equilibrium degree of capacity utilization as in the neo-Kaleckian growth 
model. Actually, the supermultiplier model shows that the existence of a demand-led pattern of economic 
growth  is  fully  compatible  with  the  tendency  towards  the  normal  utilization  of  productive  capacity. 
Therefore,  it  shows  that  allowing  the  possible  prevalence  of  arbitrarily  high  or  low  rates  of  capacity 
utilization and permanent deviations of the actual degree of capacity utilization from its normal level are 
not necessary requirements for the existence of a demand-led pattern of economic growth.

3.  Final Remarks 
In this paper we have shown how the Sraffian supermultiplier model with its hypotheses of growing non 
capacity  generating autonomous  demand and induced investment provides us with a distinct  closure for   
an  heterodox  growth  model.  Using  this  closure      changes  in  the  propensity  to  invest  can  determine  the 
saving  ratio  through  changes  in  the  fraction,  i.e.,  the  ratio  of  the  average  to  the  marginal  propensity  to 
save.  We  have  also  shown  how  the  gradual  changes  in  the  marginal  propensity  to  invest  that  allow 
capacity  to  adjust  to  demand  allow  also  for  the  reconciliation  of  demand  led  growth,  exogenous 
distribution and a tendency to normal degree of capacity utilization  even across steady states. This is in 
sharp contrast with the Cambridge model that has to resort to an implausible theory of distribution driven 
by accumulation in order to retain the idea of a tendency towards normal utilization. It constrast also with 
the  kaleckian    model  that  rightly  maintains  the  idea  of  the    lack  of  a  necessary  relation  between 
distribution and accumulation but does so at the cost of the implausible property of the  actual degree of 
utilization  being in  general  always different  from   the normal  degree, even across steady states.    In our 
view  (and  also  of  Cesaratto(2015))  the  Sraffian  supermultiplier  and  its  closure  through  an  endogenous 
saving  ratio  offer  a  useful  way  of  combining  the  classical  surplus  approach  to  distribution  and  the 
principle of effective demand in the same simple model that can be used as a tool to analyse the process 
of accumulation along the lines suggested by the pioneering work of Garegnani(1962[ 2015])).

Aggregate Demand 
determines the levels 
of aggregate output 
and capacity 
(potential) output 

Income distribution 

Endogenous  

Exogenous

ratio 

The investment share 
of output determines 
the saving ratio 

The exogenous saving 
ratio determines the 
investment share of 
output 

The investment share 
of output determines 
the saving ratio
