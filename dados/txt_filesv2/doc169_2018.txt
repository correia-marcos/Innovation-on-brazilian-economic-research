ABSTRACT
The present work aims to verify the sensitivity of Northeast agricultural production in relation to the
changes in precipitation and temperature levels in the Northeast region of Brazil. For that, data from
2006 to 2016 were used for 952 municipalities in the Northeast region, inserted in an econometric
methodology for panel data with spatial speciﬁcation. Through this procedure it was concluded that
in the last years the agricultural production of the Northeast of Brazil has become more sensitive
to the changes in precipitation levels. In addition, it was concluded that public policies to combat
the eﬀects of climate change on agriculture in the Northeast region will have greater impacts when
based on the water needs of municipalities.

INTRODUCTION

It is reasonable to assume that climate conditions aﬀect economic outcomes. The geographic
scenario in which a country or region is located, and changes which occur therein, will naturally
lead to diﬀerent results in terms of production. Therefore, how these changes in climate conditions
impact production, and by how much, has been cause for analysis and concern in recent years. The
environmental impacts caused by climate change have been an issue that has gained relevance in the
socioeconomic context since the late 20th and the beginning of the 21st century. In light of the recent
eﬀects of climate change on the environment and the global economy, tools have been put in place to
mitigate the impacts of climate-related economic activities worldwide (KUNWAR; BOHARA, 2017).
Thus, nations have recently taken greater responsibility for the eﬀects of climate change. For
example, the formulation of global goals and international agreements aims at minimizing these
eﬀects. An example of this was the Paris Agreement, set up at the 21st Conference of Parties
(COP21), in Paris, France. The agreement seeks to strengthen the global response to the threat of
climate change and strengthen the capacity that countries have to deal with the impacts of climate
change (Minist´erio do Meio Ambiente - Brazilian Ministry of Environment), (MMA, 2017).

Data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, 2017) show that the
average global temperature has increased since the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and
that global temperature growth rates began to increase after the 1940s, and intensiﬁed after the
1970s.

Yalew et al. (2017) using a microeconomic approach, ﬁnd that changes in the climate cause
diﬀerent socioeconomic impacts, that can be intensiﬁed depending on the sector analyzed. However,
the authors demonstrate that the sector that is most impacted by climate change is agriculture. As a
result, these impacts are more intense on economies which are mainly focused on the primary sector.
Nelson et al. (2009a) indicate that climate change will lead to future eﬀects that will have
major impacts, especially in economies based on the agricultural export sector. For the authors,
underdeveloped countries located along and south of the Equator will be more aﬀected.
In this
context, Rosegrant et al. (2008) forecast the inﬂuence of climate change and indicate a large future
loss of production in Brazil, especially in relation to sugarcane, rice and soybean crops.

Filho et al. (2016) highlight the eﬀects of climate change in some speciﬁc regions of Brazil.
The authors veriﬁed that the changes in the climate make it diﬃcult to exit the poverty condition in
rural areas in the North and Northeast regions of the country. In addition, the agricultural sector of
the Northeast of Brazil suﬀers greater impacts from the changes in the climate behavior, especially
when it comes to family and subsistence farming.

In this context, the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE, 2015) reports that
the general trend indicates a reduction in the level of precipitation in the Brazilian Northeast, as
well as the temperature diverging in relation to its historical average in the region. For Filho et al.
(2016), the main consequences of this phenomenon are the loss of proﬁtability of agriculture in the
region and the intensiﬁcation of poverty and social precariousness in the rural areas of the Northeast.
As discussed by Nunes (2016), the diﬀerent regions of a country, particularly one of continental
dimensions such as Brazil, suﬀer disparate eﬀects because of climate change.
In particular, says
the author, the North and Northeast regions are the most vulnerable to the current shifts in the
climate, because these regions are considered extremes in terms of environment. The author bases her
statement on the Climate Report of the Ministry of the Environment, the Secretariat of Biodiversity
and Forests and the Directorate of Biodiversity Conservation of 2015. Obermaier e Rosa (2013),
likewise, also point out that the semi-arid regions, such as the Brazilian Northeast, tend to feel a
greater impact of the variations in the climate.

In view of these considerations, the present work seeks to answer the question: What are
the impacts of climate change on the agricultural production in the Northeast of Brazil? Therefore,
the main objective of this research is to verify the sensitivity of the Brazilian Northeast agricultural

2

production in relation to the changes in precipitation and temperature levels. The hypothesis is
that the agricultural production of the Brazilian Northeast is spatially autocorrelated, generating
the spatial overﬂow of the changes in the production of a certain region to the neighboring spaces,
or municipalities.

The contribution intended concerns the quantiﬁcation of the sensitivity that the agricultural
sector has to climate change, in a region where the economy is highly dependent on agriculture. The
present work is subdivided into ﬁve sessions, including this brief introduction. The second, which
follows, encompasses the theoretical and literary foundation under which the work is based. The
third refers to the methodological framework used. The fourth discusses the results found. Lastly,
the concluding remarks are presented.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1 Climate change and its Eﬀects on the Agricultural Sector

Climate change has had worrying eﬀects in recent years, and these shifts have a stronger
impact on the agricultural sector, as discussed by various authors. This section intends to highlight
only a few of those discussions, in order to motivate the analysis performed.

In this sense, the economic literature has been giving signiﬁcant prominence to works that
analyze the behavior of agriculture in relation to climatic variations. Note, for example, Piao et al.
(2010), Parry et al. (2004), Fischer, Shah e Velthuizen (2002), and Wiebe et al. (2015), all of which,
on some level, ﬁnd correlation between shifts in the climate and economic productivity.

According to Nelson et al. (2009b), climate change has eﬀects on the agricultural sector and
aﬀects other sectors through existing sectoral integrations. Changes in the levels of greenhouse
gas emissions, temperature and precipitation cause direct changes in agricultural production, which
generate impacts on the prices of primary extraction products, impacting, thus, other sectors. Parry
et al. (2004) forecast global food production, taking into account the eﬀect of climate change and
the characteristics of population growth in the world in recent years. The authors conclude that
the consequences of climate change can be catastrophic over the next 60 years. For these authors,
it is necessary to implement long-term policies aimed at preventing the impacts suﬀered by the
agricultural sector caused by climate change, such as reducing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2)
and other greenhouse gases.

In the view of Calzadilla et al. (2013), the greatest impact on the agricultural sector as a result
of climate change is on the productivity of the factors of production. While analyzing assesses the
potential impacts of climate change and CO2 fertilization on global agriculture, using a version of
the GTAP-W model, which distinguishes between rainfed and irrigated agriculture and implements
water as an explicit factor of production for irrigated agriculture, the authors predict results for
agricultural production through projections up to the year 2050, taking into account the eﬀects of
climate change on the level of production of agriculture and the well-being of individuals. Calzadilla et
al. (2013) conclude that if the behavior of climate variables continues at the current pace, agricultural
production and welfare will fall worldwide in the next three decades.

Using a diﬀerent methodological approach, Evangelista et al. (2013) determine that the anal-
yses of the impact of changes in the climatic variables on the agricultural sector should consider the
spatial factor. The authors consider the modiﬁcations in the levels of precipitation and tempera-
ture and their impacts on the agricultural production in Ethiopia, where nearly all of the country’s
agriculture is dependent on rainfall. Evangelista, Young e Burnett (2013) verify, then, using a Max-
ent software ﬁt with crop data collected from household surveys and bioclimatic variables from the
WorldClim database to develop spatially explicit models of crop production in Ethiopia, that these
changes exhibit a common spatial behavior during the year.
In addition, the authors determine
that the impacts of climate change on agriculture are spatially concentrated in some periods and

3

subsequently spread throughout the area under analysis.

Ju et al. (2013), the changes in the temperature levels of the last decades have caused con-
siderable impacts on world agricultural production, which requires the development of adaptation
methods to these changes. However, the authors indicate that hydric changes resulting from the
alteration of rainfall levels have a greater impact on the agricultural sector. This result is also
veriﬁed by Kunwar e Bohara (2017), where the authors observe that the values of rural properties
show sensitivity to the changes of precipitations superior to the sensitivity of the changes in the
temperature.

The approach developed by Ochieng, Kirimi e Mathenge (2016), who estimate the eﬀects of
climate variability and change on agricultural revenues of small-scale farmers in Kenya, also indicates
that agricultural production can be impacted by changes in temperature and precipitation levels. The
authors, using a balanced panel household data set collected in 2000, 2004, 2007 and 2010 from eight
agro-regional zones and climate data from 1980 to 2010, argue that the interactions between these
two variables directly aﬀect the behavior of agriculture. In addition, the authors indicate an increase
in agricultural production elasticities related to precipitation and temperature levels in a projection
for the next three decades.

Performing a literary survey on climate issues in Brazil, Moraes e Filho (2013) point out
that it is necessary to understand the knowledge points concerning the issue of climate change in
Brazil, at least in its economic aspects. Furthermore, the authors argue that only from having such
knowledge it is possible to think about strategies, being this the main contribution of the works in
the area. Also, they emphasize that, in Brazil, mitigation policies are superior, in economic terms,
to the perspectives of vulnerability and/or adaptation to climate issues. However, in their opinion,
more consistent information is still necessary for society to plan its lines of action.

Cunha et al. (2013) emphasize that climate change in Brazil aﬀects mainly small producers.
Using a treatment eﬀect model with propensity score matching, the authors argue that rainfed family
agriculture is the most aﬀected by these phenomena, thus this type of production has a high sensitivity
with regard to changes in precipitation levels. Therefore, the authors stress that it is necessary to
implement measures that facilitate the technological adaptation of small rural producers to climate
variability in Brazil. Also, Cunha et al. (2013) cite irrigation as an adaptive measure to balance
the eﬀects of climate change on agriculture and highlight the importance of policies to support the
expansion of this technique for small farmers.

In this sense, Ara´ujo et al. (2014) analyze the eﬀect of climate change on the agricultural
productivity levels of the states of Northeast Brazil, considering the impact of temperature and
precipitation levels on the productivity of crops such as maize, sugar cane and manioc. The authors,
using a tobit model for panel data, conclude that the productivity levels of the crops studied could be
much higher than those that would be observable if there were no changes in the climate. In addition,
states such as Rio Grande do Norte, Para´ıba and Pernambuco may show productivity losses in the
three analyzed crops, both in the medium and long run. The authors also suggest that climate change
will negatively impact productivity levels in the municipalities of the South and Center-South of the
state of Bahia.

From another perspective, Domingues, Magalh˜aes e Ruiz (2011), analyze the impact of climate
change in the Brazilian Northeast from estimates of the implications on the availability of suitable
land for agricultural activity in a set of crops. The authors, using computable general equilibrium
models, conclude that climate change increases the potential for economic losses in the Northeast
region of the country, especially in the poorest states, pointing to the need for mitigation and emission
control policies. These authors further indicate that, if measures to prevent and lessen the eﬀects of
climate change are not implemented, the economic eﬀects on employment, for example, could have
a signiﬁcant impact on migratory ﬂows, impacting the high pressure on urban infrastructure of the
various metropoles of the Northeast and other regions of the country.

According to the work developed by Filho et al. (2016). agriculture in the Brazilian North-

4

east presents a high vulnerability to the changes in the climate, mainly in what concerns shifts in
pluviometry. The authors point out that in the coming years, the eﬀects of climate change on agri-
culture in the Northeast of Brazil will be intensiﬁed in a higher proportion than the other regions,
and hydric changes are the main issues responsible for the problem. The authors also point out that
family farming in the Northeastern region will suﬀer greater impacts from climate change than other
subsectors, thus arguing for the need to implement policies aimed at controlling and supplying water
to the region.

3 METHODOLOGY

3.1 Initial Speciﬁcation

While analyzing the impact of climate change on agriculture, Kunwar e Bohara (2017) assume
that the value of agricultural land is impacted by variations in rainfall and local temperature. Thus,
the authors use a spatial methodology for panel data to measure the impact of climate change on the
value of rural properties. Considering a Ricardian approach, Kunwar e Bohara (2017) assume that the
value of rural properties is a function of the value of the average precipitation, average temperature,
the deviations in precipitation and temperature, and the squared values of those variables.

In the present work, the approach used by Kunwar e Bohara (2017) is applied to the production
value of municipalities in the Brazilian Northeast. However, it is assumed here that the production
value is also impacted by the interactions between precipitation and temperature. In this sense, time
and space data are used, applied to a spatial econometric methodology. The following subsections
are intended to present the tools used for this procedure.

3.2 Data

The data used here comes from two diﬀerent sources. In relation to the value of agricultural
production, the sum of the total value of the production of temporary and permanent crops is
reported in the Municipal Agricultural Production (PAM, 2017), which is made available annually
by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, 2017) in the IBGE System of Automatic
Recovery (SIDRA, 2017). The value of production was corrected for December 2016 values by the
Brazilian Extended Consumer Price Index (IPCA).

Regarding the climate variables, the information was obtained in the Agrometeorological Mon-
itoring System (AGRITEMPO, 2017). The mean temperature and precipitation were constructed
using the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum daily estimates for each variable.

For the construction of climate variables by seasons, the arithmetic mean of the daily mean
values of precipitation and temperature was used. Following the speciﬁcations of INPE, the period
between December 21 and March 19 was considered as summer; March 20 to June 20 as autumn;
June 21 to September 21 as winter and September 22 to December 20 as spring1.

After the homogenization of the data, a total of 952 municipalities2 of the Brazilian Northeast
region comprise the database, being 30 municipalities of the state of Sergipe, 37 municipalities in
the state of Alagoas, 290 in the state of Bahia, 83 in the state of Pernambuco, 67 in the state of
Para´ıba, 55 in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, 112 in Cear´a, 338 in Piau´ı, and 140 in the state
of Maranh˜ao, Thus, the QGIS software was used to construct a digital layer in the shapeﬁle format

1It should be noted that in much of the Brazilian Northeast, climate seasons are not temporally well deﬁned as
speciﬁed, however, given the great variability in the deﬁnition of the seasons, and the lack of concrete information
about the time in which these seasons occur in each municipality of the region, the authors decided to consider the
period of the four conventional climate seasons as deﬁned by INPE.

2The other municipalities were disregarded in view of the lack of information on climate variables or the value of

agricultural production.

5

(cid:40)

using points for the delimitation of the geographic location of each municipality, and afterwards, the
Geoda software was used for the construction of the spatial weights matrices and calculation of the
spatial autocorrelation indicators.

The period between 2006 and 2016 was chosen for this work. This choice was due to the

greater availability of information on the climate variables featured in the Agritempo system.

3.3 Spatial Proximity Matrix

As the present work uses data distributed in time and space, the ﬁrst step to be considered is
to model the proximity of the spatial units in a numerical way. For this purpose, a spatial proximity
matrix is constructed, consisting of an instrument capable of identifying neighboring units of a given
region by means of the representation of areas in numerical terms. Based on the speciﬁcation given
by Almeida (2012), the neighborhood matrix has the following structure:

Wij =

1,
0,

if i and j are neighbors
if i and j are not neighbors

(1)

3.4 Global Spatial Autocorrelation

When dealing with spatial data, before performing any econometric procedure, it is necessary
to make an analysis of the characteristics of the spatial distribution of the data. This analysis is
done in the present work through the veriﬁcation of spatial autocorrelation, using the Moran Global
Index, presented by Almeida (2012) as:

(cid:80)

i

(cid:80)
(cid:80)n
j Wij(Zi − Z)(Zj − Z)
i (Zi − Z)2

I =

(2)

Where n represents the number of regions analyzed, Zi is the value of the analyzed variable in
area I, i, Z is the mean value of the variable in a certain area, and Wij represents the values indicated
by the spatial proximity matrix used. The rejection of the null hypothesis of Moran’s I, together
with the positive sign, indicates the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data. Non-rejection of
the null hypothesis or the negative sign indicates a random dispersion of the data.

3.5 Econometric Methodology

In order to verify the sensitivity of agricultural production to climate change, the present work
makes use of the method proposed by Kunwar e Bohara (2017), which uses a Ricardian approach to
measure the sensitivity of the value of rural establishments to climate change in Nepal.

Initially, a conventional model for panel data is considered, which is given by:

yit = αi + βCmedit + θCmed2

it + Cestdvit

+ νCest2

it + ω(precit ∗ tempit) + Γ(precit ∗ tempit)2 + φcontrol + it

(3)

Where α1, . . . , αn is a vector corresponding to the ﬁxed eﬀects. y is the natural logarithm of
the value of agricultural production, Cmedit is the annual mean of the climate variable (temperature
and precipitation)3 , Cestdvit represents the deviations of the climatic variables by season of the
year, prec represents the precipitation, temp is the temperature and it is the random error.

3Considering y as the value of rural establishments and X as the explanatory variables. Kunwar and Bohara (2017)
consider a model such that y = f (X, X2, Xdv). However, considering the problem of collinearity with the data used,
the climate variables by season were only approached in the present work in its quadratic form.

6

However, Anselin (1999) indicates that when dealing with spatial data, the assumption of
homogeneity must be addressed in the econometric procedures used. Non-homogeneity may indicate
that the coeﬃcient of an explanatory variable is statistically signiﬁcant in a given municipality and
not signiﬁcant in another spatial unit.

Some techniques for crossection estimations are able to control this problem. However, these
operations may not produce the same eﬀects for stacked data. Thus, Elhorst (2003) indicates that
the combination of stacked data with spatial models is one of the most robust tools in the ﬁeld of
spatial econometrics and that there are still unanswered questions about these methods, such as the
control of spatial heterogeneity over the estimated coeﬃcients.

Barreto, Almeida e Lima (2010) use ﬁxed eﬀects to control spatial heterogeneity, a procedure
also adopted in the present investigation. Still, Baylis, Paulson e Piras (2011) emphasize that in this
type of approach, one must also reduce errors by including factors external to the climatic variables
that aﬀect agriculture in the diﬀerent units of space such as population, infrastructure, income,
demographic density, conditioning factors irrigation etc. Therefore, the reduction of the eﬀects from
stochastic errors can be achieved by inserting a set of control variables into the estimates4.

In the present work, control variables were incorporated in view of data availability and taking
into account the procedures used in literature as done by Baylis, Paulson e Piras (2011) and Kunwar
e Bohara (2017). With this, the natural logarithm of the Municipal Gross Domestic Product (GDP)5.
the average area available per inhabitant6 and the natural logarithm of the municipal population7.
Beginning from Equation 4 and using the procedure of incorporation of the spatial eﬀects given
by Elhorst (2010), one arrives at a general ﬁxed eﬀects model that includes the spatial dependency
including spatial lags to have control of the spatial autocorrelation, being given by:

yit = αi + ρW1yit + βCmedit + θCmed2

it + Cestdvit + νCest2
+ Γ(precit ∗ tempit)2 + φcontrol + W1(βCmedit + θCmed2
+ Cestdvit + νCest2
+ Γ(precit ∗ tempit)2 + φcontrol)τ + ξt
with ξt = λW2ξt + t

it + ω(precit ∗ tempit)

it

it + ω(precit ∗ tempit)

(4)

Where W1yt is the dependent variable spatially lagged, W2t are the error terms spatially
lagged, W is the neighborhood matrix, and λ and ρ are the scalar spatial parameters, being τ a
vector of spatial coeﬃcients.

The general model of random eﬀects with spatial dependence is presented by Almeida (2012)

as:

yit =

ρW yit + βCmedit + θCmed2

it + Cestdvit + νCest2

+ Γ(precit ∗ tempit)2 + φcontrol + W (βCmedit + θCmed2
+ Cestdvit + νCest2
+ Γ(precit ∗ tempit)2 + φcontrol)τ + ξt
with ξt = λW ξt + t

it + ω(precit ∗ tempit)

it

it + ω(precit ∗ tempit)

(5)

4These variables were chosen based on various works in the literature, such as Baylis, Paulson e Piras (2011) and

Kunwar e Bohara (2017).

5Made available annually by the IBGE. In view of the non-availability of this information for the year 2016, an
estimate was considered, which was reached by multiplying the growth rate of the GDPs of 2014 and 2015 with the
GDP of 2015.

6Baylis, Paulson e Piras (2011) use population density. However, considering the collinearity problem of this
variable with the data used here, it was decided to use the average area per inhabitant, given by Area (municipal) /
Population.

7Population estimates made available by the IBGE were used.

7

Imposing the restrictionρ (cid:54)= 0, τ = 0 and λ = 0 to the model speciﬁed in Equation (4), one

obtains the ﬁxed eﬀects model with spatial lags given by:

yit = α + ρyit + βCmedit + θCmed2

+ Γ(precit ∗ tempit)2 + φcontrol + t

it + Cestdvit + νCest2

it + ω(precit ∗ tempit)

(6)

Imposing the restriction ρ (cid:54)= 0, τ = 0 and λ = 0 to the model speciﬁed in Equation (5), one

obtains the random eﬀects model with spatial lags given by:

yit = ρW yit + βCmedit + θCmed2

it + Cestdvit + νCest2
it

+ ω(precit ∗ tempit) + Γ(precit ∗ tempit)2 + φcontrol + ξt
with ξt = α + t

(7)

The spatial error model with ﬁxed eﬀects is also considered, which is characterized by featuring
the spatial autocorrelation in the form of an autoregressive error. In order to obtain this model, the
constraints ρ = 0, τ = 0 and λ (cid:54)= 0 are imposed on Equation (4), to achieve:

yit = α + βCmedit + θCmed2

it + Cestdvit + νCest2
it

+ ω(precit ∗ tempit) + Γ(precit ∗ tempit)2 + φcontrol + ξt
with ξt = λW ξt + t

(8)

For the spatial error model with random eﬀects, the constraints ρ = 0, τ = 0 and λ (cid:54)= 0 in

Equation (5) yield:

yit = βCmedit + θCmed2

it + Cestdvit + νCest2
it

+ ω(precit ∗ tempit) + Γ(precit ∗ tempit)2 + φcontrol + ξt
with ξt = α + λW ξt + t

(9)

The choice of the more appropriate model among the estimates is made using the criteria
indicated by Almeida Almeida (2012), where the choice of the appropriate model should be made
according to: (i) verifying if the observed eﬀects should be included in the estimates; (ii) choosing
the most appropriate model with unobserved eﬀects; (iii) the appropriate model with no observed
eﬀects is estimated; (iv) checking the spatial dependence of the residue; (v) verifying the presence
of spatial autocorrelation in the residues of the model with unobserved eﬀects, one estimates the
panel data model encompassing spatial autocorrelation; (vi) the model that does not present spatial
autocorrelation in the residues and that presents the least information criterion is chosen.

If the model chosen is the spatial lag model, as shown in Equation (6), it is possible to obtain
the local and total impacts of the climate variations by calculating the marginal eﬀects, which are
given by LeSage e Pace (2009) as:

δyi
δxir

δyi
δxjr

= Sr(W )ii

and

= Sr(W )ij

8

(10)

In which Sr(W ) = (In − φW )−1βr, i and j represent municipalities i and j respectively. βr is
the coeﬃcient of the r-th variable and Sr(W ) is an (n x n) matrix where the elements contained in
the main diagonal represent the direct impacts and the elements outside the main diagonal represent
the indirect impacts. The sum of these two impacts forms the total impact. Once the estimates
have been made and the appropriate model chosen, the next step is to calculate the sensitivity of the
agricultural production in relation to the level of precipitation and the temperature. Following the
procedure of Kunwar and Bohara (2017), and including the interactions between precipitation and
temperature, this process is given by:

E(

δln(y)
δprec

The average precipitation of the analyzed period was 2.7175 mm. which, in accumulated
values, would generate an average annual precipitation of approximately 990 mm. It is also observed
that the greatest precipitations occur during the summer and fall, which corresponds to the period
from December 21 to June 20.

The average temperature for the analyzed period was 25.7391oC. Checking the square of the
averages by seasons, it is observed that the highest temperatures occur in the spring, that is, between
September 22 and December 20.

The standard deviations inform how much the climate variables distance themselves from
the average, allowing an approximation of the quantiﬁcation of the climate changes. Regarding
precipitation and temperature, Table 1 shows that, on average, the greatest climate changes occur
during the winter, that is, between June 21 to September 21.

Before making any statistical inference, it is necessary to verify the temporal characteristics of
the data. Therefore, the stationarity condition of the variables was analyzed by the Levin-Lin-Chu
stationarity test. The results of this procedure are shown in Table 9, featured in the appendix. The
rejection of the null hypothesis conﬁrms that all the variables used are distributed around a ﬁxed
mean, with constant variance over time, which indicates the stationarity condition of the series.

Table 2 presents the results obtained with the Moran Global Index for the agricultural pro-
duction of the analyzed municipalities. For all the years considered in the sample, the Moran Global
Index presented a positive value and was statistically signiﬁcant. This result indicates that the agri-
cultural production of the studied municipalities is spatially autocorrelated. This implies a spatial
overﬂow of production, that is, changes occurred in the agricultural production of a given munici-
pality overﬂow in spatial terms, causing changes in the agricultural production of the neighboring
municipalities.

After verifying the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data used, the next step is to
measure the sensitivity of agricultural production in relation to precipitation and temperature by
means of a procedure that encompasses the eﬀects stemming from these phenomena. In the present
work this process is done through a spatial data panel. In order to decide which estimator should
be considered, an F test was initially used to verify the possibility of estimation of the models
through Ordinary Least Squares via a pooled model. With this procedure, the null hypothesis of
there being no signiﬁcant eﬀects was rejected. In addition, a Breusch-Pagan test was performed and
it was veriﬁed that it is not possible to ignore the presence of signiﬁcant eﬀects, which can only be
adequately treated through the Fixed Eﬀects estimator.

Once the estimates are obtained, one must check whether the eﬀects should be treated as ﬁxed
or random. For that purpose, the Hausman test is used in this work. It is veriﬁed that in all the
estimations the random eﬀects are invalid, and, therefore, the ﬁxed eﬀects model must be considered
to answer the problem here. The results of these procedures are presented in Table 3.

For models with spatial speciﬁcation, a neighborhood matrix of type K neighbors with K =
1 was used. The choice of this matrix was determined by the criteria indicated by Baumont (2004).
This mechanism consists in estimating the model without the spatial eﬀects, obtaining the model
residues and verifying the spatial autocorrelation of the residues through the Moran Global Index,
taking into account a set of neighborhood matrices9. Then, the matrix chosen will be the one that
obtains the greatest statistically signiﬁcant value for the Moran Global Index applied to the residuals
of the model without spatial eﬀects.

In order to choose the model that explains the problem in question more adequately, the
procedure indicated by Almeida (2012) was used. as speciﬁed in subsection 3.4. Having fulﬁlled
the prepositions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), the absence of spatial autocorrelation in the spatial
speciﬁcation of the ﬁxed eﬀects models was veriﬁed. Thus, the appropriate model that explains the

relationships analyzed is the spatial lag model, considering that it presented the lowest information
criterion.

Analyzing the spatial lag model, it is veriﬁed that the spatial autocorrelation coeﬃcient (ρ)
features a positive signal and was statistically signiﬁcant. This result may indicate the existence
of clusters for agricultural production in the Northeast region of Brazil. Furthermore, the value
obtained with the coeﬃcient (ρ) indicates that the changes in the production of a given municipality
overﬂow in spatial terms, also impacting neighboring municipalities. As a consequence of this result,
it should be pointed out that a public policy aimed at impacting the agricultural production of the
Northeast of Brazil should take into consideration the possibility of capturing the eﬀects arising from
spatial proximity.

The squares of the levels of precipitation by season show that increased precipitation in au-
tumn reduces the value of agricultural production in the Brazilian Northeast. The values obtained
with the coeﬃcients of the temperatures per season of the year in their quadratic form indicate
that temperature increases in autumn reduce agricultural production, while the increase in winter
temperatures leads to greater values of agricultural production in the Northeast.

The results obtained with the temperature deviations show that the increase in the positive
distance between the temperature in autumn and the average annual temperature causes increases
in the value of agricultural production in the Northeast. In relation to precipitation deviations, it
is observed that the increase in the positive distance between spring precipitation and the annual
average precipitation reduces the production value in the region.

Regarding the control variables, the results show that the increase of the available area for
each inhabitant as well as for the municipal population in general reduces the value of agricultural
production.

One of the advantages of estimating the spatial lag model is the possibility of quantifying
spatial overﬂow through direct. indirect and total marginal eﬀects10 . The results for this procedure
are presented in the appendix in Table 7. The averages for the marginal eﬀects of the quadratic
variables are outlined in Table 4. The average direct eﬀects of the squares of the precipitation levels
indicate that an increase in precipitation of a given municipality in 1 mm during the autumn season
reduces the value of the agricultural production of that municipality by approximately 0.0155%. The
indirect marginal eﬀects of this variable indicate that the increase of 1 mm in the average autumn
rainfall in a given municipality reduces by approximately 0.0038% the value of the agricultural
production of neighboring municipalities. The overall impact of the 1mm increase in the average
temperature in the fall is a reduction of 0.0194% in the value of agricultural production.

Regarding the squares of the temperatures by seasons, the direct eﬀects show that the increase

of 1 mm in the average autumn and winter temperatures of a given municipality reduces by 0.4523%
and increases by 0.1307%, respectively. the value of agricultural production in that municipality. On
the other hand, the indirect eﬀects indicate that the increase of 1 ◦c in the temperature of autumn
and winter in a certain municipality overﬂows spatially, reducing by 0.1127% and 0.0325% the value
of the agricultural production of the neighboring municipalities. Also, the total eﬀects indicate that
the 1 ◦c increase in autumn and winter temperatures in municipality i reduces by 0.5664% and
increases by 0.1631%, respectively, the value of the agricultural production in that municipality and
in the neighboring municipalities.

Continuing the analysis of the marginal eﬀects of the ﬁxed-eﬀects model with spatial lags, it
can be observed that the values of the direct eﬀects for the quadratic temperature in the autumn
and winter seasons and the deviations of the temperature in autumn and the precipitation in spring
diﬀer from the value of their respective coeﬃcients in the estimation described in Table 3. According
to LeSage e Pace (2009), this diﬀerence occurs as a result of the so-called feedback eﬀect, which
denotes changes in the value of agricultural production, which overﬂow in spatial terms and with the
passage of time returns to the municipality of origin.

Regarding the deviations of temperatures per season, the direct eﬀects indicate that the
increase of 1 ◦c in the fall temperature in relation to the annual average temperature causes a local
elevation of 0.3432% in agricultural production. On the other hand, the indirect eﬀects indicate that
the increase of 1 ◦c in the temperature of autumn in relation to the average annual temperature of a
given municipality increases by 0.0853% the agricultural production of its neighbors. The total eﬀects
indicate that the overall impact of this change is 0.4285% on the value of agricultural production.

The direct marginal eﬀects of seasonal precipitation deviations indicate that a 1 mm rise in
the distance between the average precipitation in the spring and the average annual precipitation
of a municipality reduces its agricultural production by 0.0259%, and in 0.0064% the production
of neighboring municipalities, respectively. The total eﬀects show that the overall impact of this
change, considering the speciﬁc municipality and its neighbors, is a reduction of 0.0323% in the value
of agricultural production.

The impacts of temperature and precipitation on agricultural production can only be visual-
ized by calculating the sensitivities as denoted in Equation 11. This procedure is demonstrated in
terms of averages for the Northeast region of Brazil in Figure 1.

From 2006 to 2011, agricultural production in the Brazilian Northeast was more sensitive
to changes in temperature levels than to changes in average precipitation. From that point on,
agricultural production became more sensitive to changes in precipitation levels, with the exception
of 2014. Also, comparing the year 2016 with the beginning of the analyzed period, agricultural
production in the Northeast region became more sensitive to changes in precipitation levels and less
sensitive to changes in temperature.

The trajectory of the sensitivities outlined in Figure 1 demonstrates an already expected
and well-known conclusion, which indicates a great dependence of the agricultural sector on rainfall
stability and that public policies to combat the eﬀects of climate change on agriculture in the Brazilian
Northeast region will have greater impacts when based on hydric soil characteristics.

The high levels of sensitivity of the Northeastern agricultural production to climate change,
as well as the intensiﬁcation of the average sensitivity to the changes in pluviometry described in

14

Figure 1, expose producers to a situation already veriﬁed by Burke e Emerick (2016), which indicate
that farmers need adaptation to the new climate scenarios, mainly with respect to technology and
other factors that inﬂuence agricultural productivity.

Figure 1: Average sensitivity of agricultural production in relation to precipitation and temperature.

Source: Elaborated by the authors using the research data.

The intensiﬁcation of agricultural production sensitivity in relation to changes in average
precipitation levels from 2014 can be explained mainly by the worsening water scarcity that has been
installed in most of the municipalities of the Brazilian Northeast in this period, as shown by the
World Bank document organized by De Nys, Engle e Magalh˜aes (2016).

Thus, it can be stated that the control of temperature shifts is an important mechanism for
the adequate performance of agricultural production in the Brazilian Northeast. However, as stated
by Filho et al. (2016), climate-friendly policies for the agricultural sector will produce greater impacts
if they are based on the control and eﬃcient use of local water resources.

Table 5 shows the mean sensitivities for the Brazilian Northeast and the states of the region.
It is veriﬁed that. on average. the increase of 1 mm in the level of annual rainfall increases the value
of agricultural production in the Northeast by 0.1874%, while the increase of 1 ◦c in the average
annual temperature raises agricultural production by 0.2129% in the region.

Furthermore, it is possible to observe that Cear´a was the state that showed the greatest average
sensitivity in relation to changes in annual precipitation, followed by the states of Rio Grande do
Norte and Para´ıba. In relation to temperature, the highest average sensitivity was obtained by the
state of Maranh˜ao, followed by the states of Piau´ı and Cear´a.

Considering the averages, only the states of Bahia and Maranh˜ao show sensitivity levels to
rainfall changes lower than the values obtained by the Northeast region as a whole. Regarding tem-
perature, this behavior was observed for the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Cear´a, Para´ıba, Pernambuco,
Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe.

Table 6 features a more detailed description of the average sensitivities of precipitation and
temperature, presenting values per year for each Brazilian state in the region. Regarding the average
sensitivities for precipitation, Table 6 shows that all the states in the region presented sensitivity
growth in the year 2016, when compared to the initial year of the sample. It should be noted that the
sensitivity of the agricultural sector to rainfall changes has already been veriﬁed for other localities,
as discussed by Kunwar e Bohara (2017), which analyzed Nepal, and Baylis, Paulson e Piras (2011),
which studied the United States of America.

Speciﬁcally, between 2006 and 2009, the state of Pernambuco was more sensitive to rainfall
changes. In 2011, this characteristic was observed for the state of Sergipe, and from 2010 onwards,
the greatest sensitivities to rainfall changes were observed in the state of Rio Grande do Norte.

Regarding the average sensitivity to shifts in temperature, it is veriﬁed that all the states in
the region had their sensitivities decreased, when comparing the values of 2016 with the initial year
of sample.

The greatest sensitivities were obtained by the State of Maranh˜ao, from 2006 to 2016. This
result is consistent with expectations, considering the geographic location of the state to the North-
west of the region, and its proximity to the Northern region of Brazil. Furthermore, according to
INPE (2015), the annual rainfall level of Maranh˜ao makes it stand out, presenting a tendency that
diﬀerentiates it from other states regarding temperature eﬀects.

In general, the results presented in Table 6 indicate that agricultural production in the North-
east region has become increasingly sensitive to variations in the precipitation levels, while changes
in average temperatures have inﬂuenced to a lesser extent the value of agricultural production.

Historically, agricultural production in the Northeast region of Brazil has suﬀered from a
lack of policies aimed at solving the problems arising from the region’s water shortages, such as the
application of measures to encourage the eﬃcient use of water resources in farming. Also, these
results indicate that public policies to combat the eﬀects of climate change on agriculture in the
Northeast region of Brazil will have greater impacts when based on the water needs of this region’s
municipalities.

Thus, it can be said that agriculture in the municipalities of the Northeast region of Brazil
has suﬀered from a greater lack of policies aimed at solving the problems stemming from the water
scarcity of the region. Also, the need to apply incentive measures to the eﬃcient use of water resources
in agriculture can be highlighted.

5 CONCLUDING REMARKS

The present work had as its objective to verify the sensibility of the agricultural production
in the Northeast region of Brazil in relation to changes in precipitation and temperature levels. For
that purpose, climate data was used, organized in terms of time period and geography, and the
sensitivities were estimated by means of an econometric procedure for spatial panel data.
i.e., the
adopted econometric procedure includes the eﬀects of the spatial proximity of the data units. Mean

17

precipitation and temperature data were used for a set of municipalities in the Northeast region of
Brazil between 2006 and 2016.

The results showed that the agricultural production of the municipalities of the Brazilian
Northeast is spatially autocorrelated over the years analyzed. The existence of spatial agglomerations
of agricultural production in the Northeastern municipalities was veriﬁed through the calculation
of the Moran Global Index, indicating that there are municipalities with high (or low) levels of
production, which have neighbors with these same characteristics. Through the estimation of a spatial
lag model, it was observed that changes in the production of a given municipality overﬂow spatially,
also impacting the neighboring municipalities. Thus, public policies to support the agricultural
sector of the Northeastern municipalities should be applied at a regional, and not just municipal,
level, allowing greater eﬃciency.

With the calculation of the sensitivities, it was also veriﬁed that from 2006 to 2011, the
agricultural production of the Brazilian Northeast was more sensitive to changes in temperature
levels than to changes in average precipitation. However, after the years 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016,
agricultural production has become more sensitive to changes in the precipitation levels.

It was also noted that in the analyzed period there was an increase in the average sensitivity
of the agricultural production in relation to the precipitation levels, while the average temperature
sensitivity showed a decrease. In addition, it was veriﬁed that, on average, the agricultural production
of the states of Pernambuco, Sergipe and Rio Grande do Norte present the greatest sensitivities to
rainfall changes, while agriculture in the state of Maranh˜ao is the most sensitive to changes in
temperature levels.

Lastly, it can be concluded that the agricultural production in the Northeast region of Brazil
has featured a lack of policies aimed at solving the problems arising from the region’s water shortages,
such as the application of measures to encourage the eﬃcient use of water resources in farming.
Furthermore, this work surmises that public policies to combat the eﬀects of climate change on
agriculture in the Northeast region of Brazil will have greater impacts when based on the water
needs of this region’s municipalities.
