This  article  analyses  the  relationship  between  fiscal  decentralization  and 
regional  inequalities  in  Brazil.  The  paper  utilizes  aggregated  data  for  the 
period  from  1980  to  2014  and  shows  a  negative  correlation  between  the 
process  of  fiscal  decentralization  and  regional  inequalities  in  Brazil.  The 
empirical estimates were made using dynamic panel data models with data 
for  the  27  Brazilian  states  over  a  period  of  20  years  (1995-2014).  The 
results  show  that  the  policy  of  fiscal  decentralization  has  been  an 
important  instrument  for  reducing  income  inequality  among  states.  We 
also  highlight  the  role  of  educational  policies  as  instruments  to  reduce 
inequalities.

Introduction 
 
Fiscal  decentralization is  a recurring theme in  the economic literature  as  a mechanism 
capable  of 
to  Oates  (1972), 
decentralization allows a better understanding of the population's preferences, allowing 
a  greater  efficiency  in  the  allocation  of  public  resources.  As  per  Tiebout  (1952), 
decentralization  stimulates  competition  among  federated  jurisdictions,  which  can 
generate innovations and improve the well-being of the population. 

improving  public  sector  efficiency.  According 

However,  there  are  countless  criticisms  of  decentralization,  one  of  which 
concerns  the  distribution  of  resources  within  the  federation.  Prudhomme  (1995) 
suggests  that  a  stronger  central  government,  namely,  a  more  centralized  public  sector, 
improves  the  distribution  of  resources  among  regions  as  it  tends  to  channel  resources 
from the richer regions to the poorer regions. 

Per  Canaleta,  Arzoz  and  Gárate  (2004),  there  are  two  lines  of  argument  that 
guide the debate on the relations between decentralization and regional inequalities, the 
first  one oriented to  the  theory  of public  choices, which suggests decentralization as a 
mechanism to reduce regional disparities and as another key to strengthening the central 
government to  reduce regional disparities. Dash (2014) points out that the relationship 
between  decentralization  and  regional  inequality  is  an  empirical  question.  Further,  the 
study states that this relationship is not direct and is associated with the specific context 
of each country. 

In  Brazil,  the  fiscal  decentralization  occurred  with  the  promulgation  of  the 
Federal  Constitution  of  1988.  The  new  federative  pact  increased  the  participation  of 
subnational  governments  (states  and  municipalities)  in  the  distribution  of  resources 
collected and in the incurrence of public expenditure. Among the characteristics of the 
tax  system  and  the  fiscal  federalism  adopted  in  Brazil,  it  is  noteworthy  that  there  is  a 
strong  fiscal  imbalance  vertically.  This  naturally  induces  intergovernmental  transfer 
mechanisms.  In  this  federative  arrangement,  there  is  a  reduction  in  the  role  played  by 
the States and an increase in the functional importance of the municipalities.  

In  the  1990s,  the  States  experienced  a  severe  financial  crisis.  Among  other 
factors, this crisis of the states originated in the federative redesign by the Constitution 
of 1988 and from the stabilizing policies adopted by the federal government from 1995 
onwards. The need for States to adapt to the new economic reality has further reduced 
their managerial capacity. Between 1991 and 2000, the internal debt of the states went 
from approximately 7.2% to 15% of the national GDP1. 

In the 2000s there was a relative improvement in state finances, with an increase 
in  fiscal  effort  and  a  significant  reduction  in  the  relative  debt  of  the  states  (in  2010  it 
represented  11.5%  of  the  national  GDP).  These  results  were  partially  due  to  the 
imposition  of  new  institutional  arrangements,  such  as  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  Law 
(LRF)  and  Law  No.  9,496/97,  that  mandated  new  directions  for  fiscal  policy  in  the 
states.  Araújo  and  Paes  (2015)  showed  that  the  average  fiscal  effort  of  the  states 
increased  by  32%  in  the  period  from  1995  to  2010;  the  authors  emphasized  that  the 
fiscal  performance  achieved  in  the  2000s  was  a  result,  among  other  factors,  of  the 
institutional adjustments imposed on the states in the late 1990s. 

On the other  hand, we have the socioeconomic  characteristics of  Brazil, which 
highlight  the  strong  economic  imbalance  between  the  five  regions  that  make  up  the 
country.  In  2014,  the  share  of  GDP  by  regions  was  5.3%,  9.4%,  13.9%,  16.4%  and 
54.9% in the North, Central-West, Northeast, South and Southeast regions, respectively. 
Regional inequalities have been identified by other economic and social indicators. For 
example,  the  percentage  of  illiterate  people  (aged  15  or  over)  in  Brazil  in  2014  was 

 

 

8.27%,  whereas  in  the  South  region  it  was  only  4.39%  and  in  the  Northeast  region  it 
was  16.81%.  These  socioeconomic  differences  between  regions  may  be  reversible; 
however, they are inherent to the historical process of economic formation in Brazil. 

In this context, the objective of this paper is to analyse the relationship between 
fiscal decentralization and regional inequalities in Brazil. Specifically, it seeks evidence 
that the fiscal policy of decentralization, heavily intensified in the re-democratization of 
the country, has some effects on the problem of regional inequality. To do so, we report 
some  stylized  facts  and  produce  some  estimates.  The  results  show  that  fiscal 
decentralization in Brazil contributes to reducing inequalities. The paper contributes to 
the empirical literature because it is a specific discussion about the Brazilian economy. 

The article has the following structure: The next section provides an overview of 
fiscal decentralization and regional inequality in Brazil. In the third section, we present 
the  data  and  the  methodology.  In  the  fourth  section,  the  results  are  discussed,  and  the 
fifth section provides the conclusions of the article. 
 
Fiscal decentralization and regional inequalities in Brazil (some indicators) 
 
Fiscal  decentralization  in  Brazil  was  closely  associated  with  the  process  of  re-
democratization  that  began  in  the  late  1970s,  and  both  were  consolidated  with  the 
promulgation of the Federal Constitution  in 1988. Among the tax changes imposed by 
the  new  Constitution,  we  highlight  the  redistribution  of  fiscal  control  and  the 
strengthening  of  mechanisms  for  intergovernmental  transfers.  The  new  federative 
design  has  given  subnational  governments  new  bases  of  collection;  however,  the 
expansion of fiscal obligations has made the current growth of local governments’’ own 
revenue  insufficient.  Thus,  the  changes  have  not  corrected  the  fiscal  imbalances; 
further, the role of intergovernmental transfers has been overestimated.  

Table  1  shows  the  change  of  the  participation  of  subnational  governments  in 
revenue  collection.  We  highlight  the  strong  growth  of  the  Brazilian  tax  burden  that 
increased  by  approximately  37%  in  the  period  from  1980  to  2010.  This  growth  is  a 
direct consequence of the tax reform mandated by the Constitution of 19882. In a little 
more  than  thirty  years,  the  states  increased  their  share  in  the  tax  burden  by  60%  and 
their  total  revenue  by  17%.  Although  the  share  of  municipalities  in  the  tax  burden  is 
small, it grew by 130%.

In  sharing  the  tax  burden,  the  states  were  responsible  for  the  collection  of  the 
“Tax on the Circulation of Goods and Services” (ICMS), which is the main excise tax. 
In  2014,  ICMS  revenue  was  equivalent  to  6.82%  of  GDP  and  represented  82%  of  the 
tax  revenue  of  the  states.  Thus,  the  vertiginous  growth  of  the  role  of  the  States  in  the 
composition of the tax burden is reflected specifically in the collection of ICMS. 

Decentralization can also be observed in the case of expenditure because of the 
role played by transfers that increase the revenue available to subnational governments. 
In Table 1, we observe that the participation of states and municipalities is greater in the 
execution of expenses than in the collection of revenues. The major net beneficiaries of 
the transfers are the municipalities. In 2014, municipalities accounted for 7.55% of GDP 
whereas their tax revenue was only 2.09% of GDP. 

Data  from  the  National  Treasury  Secretariat  (STN)  show  the  importance  of 
intergovernmental transfers in the budget of subnational governments. In 1989, the tax 
revenue (local revenue) of Brazilian municipalities represented approximately 9% of the 
total municipal expenditure; in 2014, this percentage was approximately 27%. However, 
revenues  from  intergovernmental  transfers  increased  from  64%  to  74%  of  total 
municipalities'  expenditure.  In  1989  and  2014,  state  revenue  accounted  for  56%  and 
61% of total state expenditure, respectively, whereas transfer revenue rose from 14% to 
22% of total state expenditure. 

The data describe the fiscal decentralization that took place in Brazil, evidencing 
a  reduction  in  the  participation  of  the  Federal  Government  in  the  collection  and 
execution  of  the  expenditure.  Araujo  and  Siqueira  (2016,  p.  4)  point  out  that  "the 
decrease  is  due  to  the  loss  of  tax  base  and  the  strengthening  of  intergovernmental 
transfer mechanisms instituted by the 1988 Constitution." 
The  tax  reform  implemented  by  the  1988  Constitution  had  the  clear  objective  of 
broadening the fiscal autonomy of states  and municipalities by giving them new fiscal 
powers.  Another  point  highlighted  was  the  need  to  correct  the  strong  regional 
disparities3.  Figures  1  and  2  show  the  change  in  the  value  of  the  indicator  of  regional 
inequalities4  for  Brazil  and  their  negative  correlation  with  the  indicator  of  fiscal 
decentralization5, respectively.

In the period between 1985 and 2014, the total reduction in regional inequality 
was  28%.  This  period  presents  two  strong  inflections:  the  first  one  between  1985  and 
1991 (in this period the reduction was 10%) and the second between 2009 and 2013 (the 
reduction was 9%). It is possible to gauge visually that there is an inverse relationship 
between  fiscal  decentralization  and  regional  inequality.  The  data  suggest  that  the 
reduction of regional inequality is associated with the growth of fiscal decentralization; 
this understanding is consistent with the theory of public choices. However, this relation 
does not take into account the influence of other variables. In the next section, we will 
present our methodology and the data used in the empirical analysis. 
 
Methodology and data 
 
The  data  used  in  this  research  concern  the  period  from  1995  to  2014.  This  period  is 
chosen due to the absence of disaggregated (reliable) data for subnational governments 
for years prior to 1995. To measure the inequalities between the states of the federation, 
we use the indicator of the relative per capita income (Iit)6, given by: 

 

𝐼𝑖𝑡 =   |

𝑥𝑖𝑡
𝑦𝑡

− 1|                                        (1), 

 
where xit is the per capita GDP of the ith state of the federation in year t, and yt is 
national  GDP  per  capita  in  year  t.  This  indicator  captures  income  disparities  across 
states. In a scenario of perfect equality, the value of the indicator would be zero.  

Fiscal  decentralization  (FD)  is  measured  by  the  share  of  state  spending  in  the 

total public sector expenditure: 

 

𝐹𝐷𝑖𝑡 =  

𝑧𝑖𝑡
𝑍𝑡

                                            (2), 

 
where  zit  is  the  budget  of  the  ith  state  in  year  t  and  Zt  is  the  consolidated 

expenditure of the public sector.  

We  chose  this  indicator  because  of  the  importance  of  intergovernmental 
transfers as the main fiscal decentralization mechanism in Brazil. Transfers increase the 
share  of  state  expenditure  regardless  of  whether  their  own  revenue  increases  (as 
described in section 2). 

 

 

The relationship between interregional inequality and fiscal decentralization will 
be  estimated  using  the  panel  data  technique  (FE,  RE,  FGLS,  and  SYS-GMM 
Estimators) and the following model: 

 

 

𝐼𝑖𝑡 =  𝛼 + 𝛽𝐹𝐷𝑖𝑡 +  𝛿𝑊𝑖𝑡 +   𝜀𝑖𝑡   𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁; 𝑡 = 1, … , 𝑇              (3), 

𝜀𝑖𝑡 =   𝜇𝑖 +   𝜈𝑖𝑡                             (4), 

 
where  Wit  is  the  sociodemographic  variables  vector.  W  is  composed  of  the 
following  variables:  inequality  of  human  capital,  size  of  the  industrial  sector,  and 
population.  The  indicator  of  human  capital  inequality  is  calculated  by  the  relative 
differences  in  the  average  years  of  education  of  the  population  (over  25  years  old)  in 
each  state.  The  size  of  the  industrial  sector  is  given  by  the  industry  share  (industrial 
GDP) in the total GDP of each state. 

According to Mincer (1958), Schultz (1964), and Becker (1964) it is possible to 
make a direct association between economic growth and human capital.  Therefore, we 
assume that interregional income inequalities are positively influenced by the indicator 
of human capital inequalities. 

In structuralist theory7, industrialization is the main means for reducing regional 
inequalities. Thus, we assume that increasing industry participation in the state economy 
should reduce income inequality. 

 
Results 
 

In  a  preliminary  analysis,  we  observe  the  behaviour  of  the  average  GDP  per 
capita of the states. Figure 3 shows that, on average, the per capita GDP of the states has 
approached the Brazilian per capita GDP. However, this seemingly strong reduction of 
inequality  is  not  confirmed  by  the  median  of  the  state’s  per  capita  GDP,  which, 
throughout the period, has remained below the average per capita GDP.

The fact that more than 50% of the States have a per capita income lower than 
the  average  income  is  mainly  due  to  the  high  economic  heterogeneity  among  the 
Brazilian  regions.  The  Federal  District  (Brasília–the  capital  of  the  country)  has  the 
highest GDP per capita throughout the period, and the states of Piauí and Maranhão are 

 

 

the  poorest  in  terms  of  GDP  per  capita.  In  2014,  the  per  capita  GDP  of  the  Federal 
District was 6 times the size of per capita GDP of the state of the poorest. Although this 
difference is very large, it is 38% smaller than that observed in 1995. 

Continuing with the exploratory analysis, we verify the correlation between the 
variable  that  captures  the  inequality  (Iit)  and  the  variable  that  captures  the  fiscal 
decentralization  (FDit).  We  estimated  the  Spearman  correlation  coefficient  and  pooled 
regression model using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). 

The results, presented in  Table 2, show evidence of a negative and statistically 
significant  association  between  income  inequality  and  fiscal  decentralization  and  that 
approximately  11%  of  the  variation  in  inequality  may  be  explained  by  fiscal 
decentralization. This result, even if simplistic, allows us to theorise that the behaviour 
of  income  inequalities  between  states  can  be  influenced  by  the  changes  in  fiscal 
decentralization.

In Table 3, we present a better analysis of the relationship between the variables 
studied.  We  report  here  the  results  of  the  estimation  of  the  data  model  in  a  dynamic 
panel  (GMM-SYS  estimators)8.  In  the  estimates,  we  considered  the  variables  “Human 
Capital”,  “size  of  the  industrial  sector”,  and  “population”  as  exogenous.  The  variable 
“tax  decentralization”  was  considered  endogenous.  We  used  instrumental  models  with 
one and three lags in the dependent variable. The specification tests indicated that there 
was  no  second-order  residual  correlation  and  that  the  instruments  were  valid  for  all 
estimated  models.  All  variables  are  in  natural  logarithm  values,  so  the  estimated 
coefficients represent the elasticity. 

An  extension  of  the  analysis  was  made  by  modifying  the  data  the  database. 
Estimates  were  made  for  an  average  of  4  years  and  without  the  data  of  the  two  states 
that  presented  the  highest  and  lowest  inequality  indicators,  which  were  the  Federal 
District and Rio Grande do Sul, respectively. 

In  all  the  estimated  models,  the  coefficient  of  fiscal  decentralization  was 
negative and statistically significant. The consistency of this result clearly confirms the 
theory presented in the descriptive analysis of the data (Figure 2 and Table 2). Thus, we 
can infer that the mechanisms of fiscal decentralization provide a reduction in regional 
inequalities. 

In  the  works  of  Bonet  (2006)  and  Liu  et  al.  (2017),  the  effects  of  fiscal 
decentralization  were  positive,  namely,  higher  values  are  associated  with  higher 
inequality.  Bonet  (2006)  emphasized  that  the  fiscal  decentralization  criteria  applied  in 
Colombia  prioritized  fiscal  stability.  In  the  case  of  China,  Liu  et  al.  (2017)  associated 
the positive effects with the large dimension of fiscal decentralization, noting that there 
is an exaggeration in the attributions of China's subnational governments9.  

 

 

On  the  other  hand,  Dash  (2014)  and  Kyriacou  et  al.  (2016)  show  that  fiscal 
decentralization  reduces  regional  inequality  in  India  and  in  a  set  of  countries  (both 
developed  and  developing),  respectively.  Dash  (2014)  underscores  the  importance  of 
decentralization  to  the  poorer  states  of  India,  and  Kyriacou  et  al.  (2016)  introduce  the 
need to incorporate the quality of each Government as a key variable in the analysis. 

The  relevant  literature,  despite  the  different  methodological  strategies,  clearly 
associates  the  effect  of  decentralization  with  the  particularities  of  each  country.  As 
described  in  Section  2,  the  main  mechanism  of  fiscal  decentralization  in  Brazil  is 
intergovernmental  transfers.  Among  them,  we  highlight  for  each  state  the  FPE  
characterized  as  an  unconditional  redistributive  transference.  As  an  example,  in  2015, 
the amount of  FPE transferred to  the States was  1.02% of  the  Brazilian GDP,  and the 
North-eastern  state  (the  poorest  region)  received  approximately  52%  of  the  total 
resources transferred. 

The  control  variables  we  used  are  also  statistically  significant.  As  expected, 
human  capital  inequality  has  an  inverse  relationship  with  regional  inequality.  Many 
papers use human capital as a variable to explain income inequality. Overall, the results 
show  an  inverse  relationship  between  inequality  and  human  capital.  In  this  study,  we 
used  a  different  approach:  we  measured  an  indicator  of  relative  inequality  of  human 
capital. The result confirms the theory that relative human capital gains result in relative 
income  gains.  Thus,  greater  income  inequalities  between  states  can  be  reduced  by 
implementing policies that promote the reduction of human capital inequalities. 

The secondary sector participation in the economy did not present the result we 
expected. Barros (2011), analysing the data on the  participation of the industrial sector 
in  the  Brazilian  regions,  showed  that  there  was  a  “catch-up”  of  the  industrial  sector; 
however regional inequalities were not reduced. The author concluded that there was no 
empirical support for the ECLAC ideas that attempt to explain the regional inequalities 
in Brazil. Our results confirm the non-empirical evidence of the hypotheses defended by 
Furtado (1959). 

Finally,  we  find  that  the  coefficient  of  population  size  has  an  inverse  relation 
with the growth of regional inequalities. Although this is not a variable that presents a 
clear theoretical  relation to  inequalities, we  can  assume population  size as a proxy for 
the size of the market. That can, within certain limits, justify its importance.

Checking the robustness 
 

To  check  the  robustness  and  sensitivity  of  the  relationship  between  regional 
inequality  and  fiscal  decentralization,  we  estimate  the  same  model  by  changing  the 
measures of inequality and decentralization. 

The  new  measure  of  inequality  uses  Equation  1;  however  we  use  per  capita 
household  income  as  a  variable.  Regarding  the  decentralization  indicator,  we  used  the 
proportion of the state revenue in the total revenue. The tables below show the results of 
the new estimated models. 

We  observed  that  for  the  alternative  inequality  measure,  the  estimated 
coefficient  for  the  decentralization  indicator  remains  statistically  significant  and 
preserves  an  inverse  relation  with  the  measure  of  inequality  (Table  4).  Thus,  the 

 

 

previous  interpretations  do  not  change.  Estimating  the  model  with  the  alternative 
decentralization  indicator  (Table  5),  we  observe  a  change  of  magnitude  of  the 
coefficient; however, the interpretations also do not change. 

These results show that the estimates presented in Table 3 are consistent and not 

sensitive to changes in the measure of the indicators.

Conclusions 
 
Fiscal decentralization is a relevant topic and much debated in the economics literature. 
For the Brazilian economy, the political administrative structure implemented with  the 
Constitution  of  1988  exalts  the  role  of  fiscal  decentralization.  This  work  sought  to 
investigate  the  relationship  between  fiscal  decentralization  and  regional  inequalities, 
which is a subject rarely explored in Brazil. 

 

 

The main result shows that fiscal decentralization is an important instrument for 
reducing  regional  inequalities.  Another  important  result  is  the  positive  relationship 
between human capital inequality and regional inequalities. 

These  results  may  contribute  to  the  debate  about  public  policies  aimed  at 
reducing  regional  inequality.  Policy  makers  should  seek  to  improve  decentralization 
mechanisms  by  strengthening  the  tax  structure  that  prioritizes  redistribution  problems. 
In regards to educational policy, it is not sufficient only to raise the education rates of 
the poorest states, but also to promote higher educational growth rates than those of the 
richer states. 

Finally, there are some issues that deserve to be investigated in order to improve 
the  understanding  of  the  relationship  between  regional  inequalities  and  fiscal 
decentralization in Brazil. First, the incorporation of new indicators and decentralization 
measures associated with government quality. Poor government quality can reduce the 
efficiency  of  redistribution  mechanisms  by  reducing 
the  positive  effects  of 
decentralization. Another important issue is the simulation of the impacts of alternative 
mechanisms  of  decentralization  through  transfers  or  expansion  of  the  own  tax  base. 
Further, for Brazil, it is also possible to analyse decentralization at the municipal level. 
 

 

 

 
                                                 

1. Central Bank of Brazil. 

2. Although no new types of tax were created, there was a significant increase in rates by  

allowing the creation of new tariffs and contributions that favored the growth of the tax 

burden. 

3. The Constitution expanded the Municipal Participation Fund (FPM) and the State 

Participation Fund (FPE), which are modalities for transfers of resources from the Federal 

Government to subnational governments. 

4. The inequality indicator is the coefficient of variation (CV) weighted by the population. 

According to Ezcurra and Pascual (2006), this measure of dispersion can be written as: 

𝐶𝑉𝑡 =  

1
𝜇𝑡

[∑ 𝑝𝑖𝑡(𝑥𝑖𝑡 − 𝜇𝑡)2

𝑛
𝑖=1

1
2⁄ , 
]

where xit and pit are the GDP per capita and the proportion of Brazil’s population in the ith unit 

of the federation in year t, respectively, and mutI is defined as::  

𝑛

𝜇𝑡 = ∑ 𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑥𝑖𝑡

 

𝑖=1

5. The indicator of fiscal decentralization is the proportion of the expenditure of the subnational 

governments (states and municipalities) in the national GDP. 

6. See Bonet (2006), Qiao, Martinez-Vazquez and Xu (2008), and Kyriacou et al. (2016). 

7. See Furtado (1959) and Prebish (1962). 

8. Estimates using FE, RE and FGLS were also performed. The results are reported in the 

attached table. 

9. Liu et al (2017) also show that fiscal equalization efforts reduce inequalities.
