Abstract 

 

 Since the early 1990s several countries have adopted inflation targeting (IT). However, 
IT  may  not  be  sufficient  to  ensure  fiscal  discipline,  and  governments  can  still  pursue 
irresponsible  fiscal  policies  under  IT.  As  a  consequence,  the  adoption  of  irresponsible 
policies  which  lead  to  a  weak  fiscal  credibility  could  undermine  the  credibility  of  the 
central bank. In this study, we argue that fiscal discipline is a key aspect for IT and for 
central  bank  credibility.  This  study  contributes  with  the  literature  since  it  provides 
empirical  evidence  for  the  determinants  of  both  fiscal  credibility  and  central  bank 
credibility. Moreover, the study presents evidence for the influence of fiscal credibility 
on  central  bank  credibility.  The  empirical  analysis  is  based  on  different  econometric 
techniques (OLS, GMM and TOBIT). The findings suggest fiscal credibility is important 
to  build  central  bank  credibility.  In  other  words,  when  agents  form  expectations  that 
public debt is under control, these expectations end up influencing inflation expectations.

Resumo 

 

A partir da década de 1990, vários países adotaram o regime de metas de inflação (RMI). 
Entretanto RMI pode não ser suficiente para garantir a disciplina fiscal, e governos podem 
continuar implementando políticas fiscais irresponsáveis sob RMI. Como consequência, 
a  adoção  de  políticas  irresponsáveis,  que  leva  a  uma  fraca  credibilidade  fiscal,  pode 
enfraquecer a credibilidade do banco central. Neste estudo argumentamos que a disciplina 
fiscal  é  um  aspecto  chave  para  o  RMI  e  para  a  credibilidade  do  banco  central.  Este 
trabalho  contribui  com  a  literatura  pois  fornece  evidências  empíricas  sobre  os 
determinantes  de  ambas  a  credibilidade  fiscal  e  a  credibilidade  do  banco  central. 
Ademais,  o  estudo  apresenta  evidências  da  influência  da  credibilidade  fiscal  sobre  a 
credibilidade do banco  central.  A  análise empírica é realizada com  diferentes métodos 
econométricos (OLS, GMM e TOBIT). Os resultados sugerem que a credibilidade fiscal 
é importante para construir a credibilidade do banco central. Ou seja, quando os agentes 
forma expectativas que a dívida pública está sob controle, essas expectativas influenciam 
as expectativas de inflação.

1. Introduction 
 

According  to  Blinder  (2000,  p.  1421),  credibility  matters  in  theory,  and  it  is 
certainly  believed  to  matter  in  practice.  In  his  study,  he  asks:  Why  is  credibility  so 
important to central bankers? And how can a central bank create or enhance credibility? 
Regarding central bank credibility, Blinder (2000) presents the following definition, 
which is in accordance with Kydland and Prescott’s (1977) argument: a central bank is 
credible if people believe it will do what  it says. Based on this definition, an inflation 
targeting  central  bank  has  credibility  when  people  believe  on  the  announced  inflation 
target; and, credibility is earned when the convergence of inflation expectations for the 
inflation target occurs (Agénor and Taylor, 1992; Svensson, 2000). Based on the idea that 
series  of  expected  inflation  could  be  applied  to  derive  a  credibility  index,  existing 
measures  of  central  bank  credibility  refer  to  a  gap  between  inflation  expectations  of 
economic  agents  and  the  central  bank  inflation  target  (e.g.,  Svensson,  2000;  de 
Mendonça, 2007).  

Earning  credibility,  however,  is  not  a  trivial  task  in  emerging  economies, 
particularly, in those countries that lived for several years with high inflation rates, and 
thus, have been presenting a history of low credibility. Since the early 1990s an increasing 
number  of  emerging  and  developed  economies  have  started  implementing  inflation 
targeting  as  the  framework  to  guide  monetary  policy.  However,  according  to  Mishkin 
(2007),  inflation  targeting  may  not  be  sufficient  to  ensure  fiscal  discipline,  and 
governments  can  still  pursue  irresponsible  fiscal  policies  with  an  inflation  targeting 
regime  in  place.  As  a  consequence,  the  adoption  of  irresponsible  fiscal  policies  which 
lead to a weak fiscal credibility could undermine the credibility of the central bank.  

In this study, based on the arguments presented in the seminal work of Sargent and 
Wallace  (1981),  we  go  further  and  argue  that  fiscal  discipline  and  absence  of  fiscal 
dominance are key aspects for inflation targeting and for central bank credibility. Thus, 
if both fiscal policies and public debt management are important for inflation targeters, 
how do we build fiscal credibility? Does fiscal credibility affect central bank credibility? 
This study contributes with the literature since it provides empirical evidence for 
the  determinants  of  both  fiscal  credibility  and  central  bank  credibility.  Moreover,  the 
study presents evidence for the influence of fiscal credibility on central bank credibility. 
As far as we know, there are no studies for the determinants of fiscal credibility as well 
as  for  the  relationship  between  fiscal  credibility  and  central  bank  credibility.  The 
empirical  analysis  is  based  on  different  econometric  techniques  (OLS,  GMM  and 
TOBIT),  and  considers  the  period  from  December  2001  to  February  2016  for  the 
Brazilian economy. 
 
2. The importance of credibility  
 

In the 2006 speech to the Annual Washington Policy Conference, the President and 
CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Janet Yellen, argued that, “credibility 
is not only virtuous; it is also useful. I will argue that one of its most important benefits 
is  shaping  public  expectations  about  inflation,  and  in  particular,  ‘anchoring’  those 
expectations to price stability. As a consequence, credibility enhances the effectiveness of 
monetary policy” (Yellen, 2006). 

A  credible  monetary  policy  implies  less  effort  by  the  central  bank  for  the 
achievement of the inflation target (de Mendonça and de Guimarães  and Souza, 2012; 
Montes  and  Bastos,  2014).  Empirical  evidence  suggests  that  a  high  credibility  is 
associated with a lower volatility of the interest rate for the achievement of the inflation 

target (de Mendonça and de Guimarães and Souza, 2012). This alignment of the central 
bank’s actions and the public’s expectations strengthens monetary policy effectiveness.  
Inflation targeting works as a guide for inflation expectations and it is associated 
with an increase in central bank transparency, which, in turn, increases accountability in 
the implementation of monetary policy and thus improves credibility (de Mendonça and 
de Guimarães  and Souza, 2012). However, the fulfillment of the inflation target is the 
main factor to influence inflation expectations.  

The inflation targeting regime has played a key role in macroeconomic stabilization 
in several developed and developing countries since the beginning of the 1990s (Walsh, 
2009).  Inflation  targeting  in  emerging  market  economies  has  been  a  more  challenging 
task  than  in  developed  economies  due  to  several  vulnerabilities  and  to  low  levels  of 
credibility (Minella et al., 2003). In fact, one basic task of emerging market central banks 
has been to build credibility. This requires actions consistent with the inflation targeting 
framework  (such  as  commitment  with  price  stability,  coordination  between  fiscal  and 
monetary policies as well as fiscal and financial stability) combined with high levels of 
transparency and communication with the public (Montes, 2010). 

The  success  of  the  inflation  targeting  regime  relates,  to  a  large  extent,  with  the 
earning of credibility. Credibility in this context means that private agents believe that the 
central bank will act consistently within the inflation targeting framework (Minella et al., 
2003),  but  also  the  government  will  act  committed  with  sound  fiscal  policies.  In  this 
sense,  the  gain  of  credibility  takes  time  and  it  depends  on  both  fiscal  and  monetary 
policies.  Thus,  what  is  the  importance  of  fiscal  sustainability  and  fiscal  credibility  for 
inflation targeting emerging countries? Why fiscal sustainability so important, and how 
does it influence fiscal credibility? 

 

2.1 Importance of debt management and fiscal sustainability to fiscal credibility 
 

According to Sargent and Wallace (1981), fiscal sustainability has an unequivocal 
impact on price stability and, thus, it represents an important condition to help monetary 
policy  keeping  inflation  low  and  stable.  As  Shirakawa  (2012)  stresses,  when  the 
government loses its credibility with respect to the sustainability of government debt and 
does not make enough effort to regain it, this ultimately leads to a higher inflation or a 
default on the debt (or both). Hence, fiscal sustainability itself is an essential precondition 
for the proper functioning of a central bank (Shirakawa, 2012), and thus, fiscal credibility 
represents an essential precondition to build central bank credibility. 

Regarding the relation between fiscal sustainability and price stability, high levels 
of government debt can lead to difficulties in controlling inflation. Sargent and Wallace 
(1981)  consider  the  situation  of  a  government  running  deficits,  which  are  financed  by 
issuing government bonds. If these deficits are unsustainable, in that government will not 
be  able  to  finance  deficits  indefinitely  through  issuing  bonds,  then  eventually  the 
outstanding debt will need to be financed by an increased level of currency, and hence 
could lead to higher inflation in the future. Sargent and Wallace (1981) also stress that a 
large public debt implies a difficulty for reducing the interest rate. Moreover, if demand 
for money depends on expected inflation, then unsustainable deficits could lead to higher 
inflation in  the present  period. These arguments  present  an important  relation between 
fiscal  and  monetary  policy  and  it  justifies  fiscal  sustainability  from  the  perspective  of 
inflation targeting.  

Fiscal stability is a basic necessary condition for inflation control and for inflation 
targeting.  An  important  lesson  from  Sargent  and  Wallace  (1981)  is  that  irresponsible 
fiscal  policy  puts  pressure  on  the  monetary  authorities  to  monetize  the  debt,  thereby 

producing rapid money growth and high inflation. If fiscal imbalances are large enough, 
monetary  policy  eventually  becomes  subservient  to  fiscal  considerations  (“fiscal 
dominance”) and an inflation target would have to be abandoned or modified. Thus, fiscal 
reforms,  which  help  keep  budget  deficits  from  spinning  out  of  control  are  needed  to 
prevent the fiscal imbalances that can lead to a collapse of an inflation targeting regime 
(Mishkin, 2008).  

One typical problem of emerging economies that have adopted inflation targeting 
is that a disinflationary monetary policy can cause a fiscal imbalance. The reason is that 
the basic interest rate is the main monetary policy instrument. But, in countries such as 
Brazil, public debt is strongly indexed to the interest rate. Therefore, increases in interest 
rate  to  reach  the  inflation  target  imply  increases  in  the  primary  surplus  required  for 
stabilizing the public debt/GDP ratio. 

The  fiscal  stability  can  be  achieved  by  a  policy  based  on  a  tight  fiscal  policy 
(increase in taxes or decrease in government spending) as a way of generating primary 
surpluses.  Another  possibility  for  achieving  fiscal  stability,  such  as  pointed  out  by 
Giavazzi and Missale (2004), is the low cost government funding. Therefore, public debt 
management can be an important tool for reducing fiscal vulnerability. 
 
3. Empirical analysis 

 

In 1999, Brazil adopted inflation targeting. Since then, central bank credibility is 
fundamentally explained by central bank’s commitment with inflation control. However, 
since  fiscal  policy  and  public  debt  management  also  exert  influence  on  inflation,  and 
aiming coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, the government launched in 
1999, the “Fiscal Stability Program” (FSP). This program had the intention to strengthen 
fiscal discipline, reduce the public deficit and stabilize the debt/GDP ratio. The program 
introduced targets for the primary surplus, set limits on indebtedness and increased fiscal 
transparency. 

In terms of public debt management, at the end of 1999, in an attempt to improve 
the  composition  of  government  liabilities,  efforts  were  made  to  increase  the  share  of 
fixed-rate  and  price-indexed  securities  and  to  reduce  the  share  of  floating  rate  and 
exchange  rate-indexed  debt.  Besides,  the  Brazilian  Treasury  announced  a  strategy  for 
extending  the  maturity  of  federal  securities  (de  Mendonça  and  Vivian  2008).1  The 
Brazilian  Government  adopted  this  strategy  in  order  to  improve  credibility,based  on 
models  of  public  debt  management  (Calvo  and  Guidotti,  1990;  Giavazzi  and  Pagano, 
1990; Barro, 2003; Missale, Giavazzi, and Benigno, 2002; Giavazzi and Missale, 2004). 
Thus,  it  is  important  to  verify  if  the  measures  in  terms  of  the  public  debt 
management adopted in Brazil have helped to build fiscal credibility. Furthermore, it is 
important to analyze the determinants of central bank credibility under inflation targeting. 
 
3.1 Data 
 

The period under analysis runs from December 2001 to February 2016, containing 
171 monthly observations. The database begins in this period due to availability of the 
data regarding expectations. The series used in this study are presented as follow.  

The central bank index (CBCI) is based on the idea of Agénor and Taylor (1992) 
that  series  of  expected  inflation  could  be  applied  to  derive  a  credibility  index.  As 
Svensson  (2000)  proposed,  the  credibility  can  be  measured  by  the  difference  between 
                                                           
1 See de Mendonça and Machado (2013), Gomes, Pires and Terra (2014) and de Mendonça and Pessanha 
(2014) for more details regarding public debt management in Brazil.  

expected inflation and the target. In this sense, the credibility index is the index proposed 
by de Mendonça (2007). The central bank credibility index has a value equal to 1 when 
the annual expected inflation (𝐸[𝜋]) is equal to the target (𝜋𝑇) and decreases in a linear 
way  while  inflationary  expectation  deviates  from  the  announced  target.  Therefore,  the 
credibility index shows a value between 0 and 1 strictly if the expected inflation is situated 
between the maximum and minimum limits (𝜋∗) established for each year and assumes a 
value equal to zero when the expected inflation exceeds one of these limits. The index 
uses  the  series  of  inflation  expectations  of  professional  forecasters  obtained  from  the 
Central Bank of Brazil (CBB), the inflation target defined by the monetary authority and 
the tolerance bands. Hence,

Moreover, central bankers take time to increase or to decrease its credibility. In this 
sense,  we  work  with  the  smoothed  series  (trend)  obtained  from  the  Hoddrik-Prescott 
filter. Figure 1 shows the graph of the index and its trend.

To define what drives central bank credibility we follow Blinder (2000). The history 
of honesty is an important aspect to build credibility. In this sense, the success in keeping 
inflation under control is an important factor. We check this effect through the inflation 
deviation from the target (INFD)2, expecting a rise in the INFD to reduce central bank 
credibility.  Moreover,  to  fight  against  inflation  is  also  important  to  build  credibility.

inflation, and then is expected to increase credibility.  

Due to the fact Brazil is an emerging economy, external factors are relevant to the 
conduct  of  monetary  policy.  The  pass-through  effect  from  exchange  rate  to  inflation 
suggests exchange rate variation can affect credibility (de Mendonça and Tostes, 2015; 
Minella et al. 2003). Hence, we also check the influence of the variation in the exchange 
rate (ER)4. 

The main goal of this paper it to show the relation between fiscal credibility and 
central  bank  credibility.  The  fiscal  credibility  index  (FCI)5  is  calculated  based  on  the 
indicator proposed by de Mendonça and Machado (2013). Since credibility represents the 
belief by the public in  the probability of  a successful execution of the policy (Drazen, 
2000), and taking into account  IMF’s recommendation and Maastricht limits  to  public 
debt, the fiscal credibility index seeks to capture government’s commitment to public debt 
sustainability  and,  thus,  the  public’s  expectations  regarding  fiscal  solvency.  The 
benchmarks  assumed  in  the  fiscal  credibility  index  are  in  line  with  the  IMF’s  (2002) 
calculations. Thus, the lower limit is a public debt to GDP ratio of 40% (debtMin) because 
it is a long-term target that should not be breached by emerging economies. The upper 
limit is a public debt to GDP ratio of 60% (debtMax) because this debt to GDP ratio target 
is part of the Maastricht treaty, and thus it is a useful reference for developed countries. 
Since credibility is  a forward-looking variable, the credibility index takes into account 
the  information  (monthly  frequency)  available  by  the  CBB  on  market  expectations 
regarding public debt to GDP ratio.  

Therefore, based on these benchmarks, the credibility index considers the following 
possibilities: (i) market’s expectations on the public debt for the next 12 months are lower 
than the lower limit (40%) - in this case the risk of fiscal imbalance is null and thus the 
credibility index is 1 (full credibility); (ii) market’s expectations for the next 12 months 
are greater than the upper limit (60%) - in this case there exists a high probability that a 
fiscal  imbalance  occurs  and  thus  the  credibility  index  is  0  (null  credibility);  and  (iii) 
market’s expectations for the next 12 months are between the above‐mentioned limits - 
in this case the risk of fiscal imbalance is decreasing as it approaches the lower limit and 
it is increasing as it approaches the upper limit, thus the range of the credibility index is 
from 0 to 1 (strictly) (de Mendonça and Machado, 2013). It is expected a positive relation 
between FCI and CBCI. The credibility index is a result of:

(forecasters) about their expectations for the debt/GDP ratio. The series is provided by the CBB.

To explain the behavior of the fiscal credibility we choose a group of variables 
important  to  the  sustainability  of  the  fiscal  policy.  Fiscal  credibility  is  undermined  if 
public debt presents an unsustainable path. Giavazzi and Missale (2004) argue that the 
main goal of public debt management in Brazil is the stabilization of the debt/GDP ratio 
(DEBT).6.  Thus,  we  expect  a  negative  relationship  between  DEBT  and  FCI.  The 
indexation composition and the maturity of the public debt are also important to fiscal 
credibility.  The  average  maturity  of  the  public  debt  (AMD)7  is  connected  to  the 
refinancing risk. A more extended period of maturity is one of the factors that reduces the 
amount of bonds that need to be rolled over in a period of crisis (Giavazzi and Pagano, 
1990). The series is used following the ideas of Giavazzi and Pagano (1990), Calvo and 
Guidotti (1990) and Missale, Giavazzi and Benigno (2002), thus, it is expected a positive 
relation between AMD and FCI.  

In relation to the indexation of the public debt, we create an index to simplify the 
interpretation.  We  follow  the  idea  of  Giavazzi  and  Missale  (2004)  that  most  of  the 
Brazilian public debt should consist of fixed-rate bonds and price indexed bonds, and that 
the proportion of exchange-rate indexed bonds and interest-rate indexed bonds should be 
reduced in order to improve the composition of public debt and, thus, the efficiency in 
the  management  of  public  debt.  Hence,  increases  in  fixed  rate  bonds  (FIX_B)  and 
inflation-linked bonds (INF_B) represent improvements in public debt profile, whereas 
increases in bonds indexed to the interest rate (INT_B) and indexed to the BRL/dollar 
exchange rate (EX_B) indicate a deterioration of the public debt profile. The index is a 
result of the difference between these parts. Therefore, the index is calculated as: 
 
(3) 
 

INDEX = (FIX_B + INF_B) – (INT_B + EX_B).

positive, it denotes a good quality of the indexation profile. On the other hand, when the 
INDEX is negative, it represents a bad quality in the public debt profile. The expected 
relation between INDEX and FCI is positive. Figure 3 shows in the second semester of 
2006 the INDEX became positive and there is a trend toward improvement

  A first condition  to  be analyzed, before applying the estimations,  is to  check if 
series  have  unit  root.  Therefore,  the  following  tests  Augmented  Dickey-Fuller  (ADF), 
Phillips-Perron (PP) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) were made (Table 
A.1, Appendix). Based on the tests, one can observe that all series are stationary. 

  The empirical analysis is conducted in two stages (as shown in Figure 2): first, the 
determinants of fiscal credibility (FCI) are estimated, and then the determinants of central 
bank credibility (CBCI) are estimated.

We  estimate  the  relationships  expressed  in  Figure  4  using  ordinary  least  squares 
(OLS), generalized method of moments (GMM), TOBIT and GMM system. One reason 
for using GMM is due to endogeneity problems. Besides, this method provides consistent 
estimators for the regressions (Hansen, 1982). As pointed out by Wooldridge (2001, p. 
95), “to obtain a more efficient estimator than two-stage least squares (or ordinary least 
squares), one must have overriding restrictions.” The weighting matrix in the equation 
was chosen to enable the GMM estimates to be robust, considering the possible presence 
of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of unknown form.  

Overidentification analysis  has an important  role  in  the selection of instrumental 
variables  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  estimators  (Cragg,  1983).  We  performed  a 
standard  J-test  with  the  objective  of  testing  this  property  for  the  validity  of  the 
overidentifying  restrictions  (Hansen,  1982).  The  chosen  instruments  were  dated  to  the 
period t−1 or earlier to help predict the contemporaneous variables, which are unavailable 
at  time  t  (Johnston,  1984).  We  also  present  the  Durbin–Wu–Hausman  test  of  the 
endogeneity of regressors (Durbin, 1954; Wu, 1973; Hausman, 1978). 

Furthermore,  we  use  the  TOBIT  method  (Tobin,  1958),  which  is  an  adequate 
method  because  the  credibility  indexes  are  continuous  variables  that  assume  different 
values between 0 and 1. It is worth noting that the values of the dependent variable (MCI 
and FCI) are not concentrated in censored values. In fact, as one can see through Figure 
1, the values for MCI are not concentrated at all, and the Figure 2 shows FCI concentrate 
less  than  30%  of  the  observations.  The  TOBIT  model  uses  all  of  the  information, 
including information about the censoring data, and provides consistent estimates of the 
parameters (Long, 1997).9 

The  lags  of  the  variables  were  determined  in  an  empirical  basis  following  the 
general-to-specific  method.  This  methodology  takes  into  consideration  not  only  the 
statistical significance of the parameters, but also diagnostic tests, in order to ensure that 
the chosen model has explanatory power and thus to guarantee a parsimonious equation 
(Hendry, 2001). 

Moreover, to assure the relation we propose in this work is in the correct direction, 
we  present  in  Table  1  the  Granger  Causality  Test  to  the  two  main  variables  of  this 
analysis, CBCI and FCI. To perform this test we choose the lag of the Granger Causality 
Teste  we  follow  three  information  criterions  (Akaike,  Schwarz  and  Hannan-Quinn), 
presented  in  the  table  A.2  in  the  appendix.  The  results  of  the  Granger  Causality  Test 
indicate the CBCI does not cause FCI, but the FCI is able to influence the CBCI. This 
results suggests we choose the right direction in our analysis.

OLS estimates are based on the estimator of Newey and West (1987), which is consistent 
in the presence of both heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of unknown form. In the 
GMM10 estimation, the J-statistic indicates that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the 
instruments selection is apposite. The Durbin-Wu-Hausman test indicate the regressors 
are exogenous.  

The  results  present  the  expected  signal  to  all  variables.  The  negative  signal  for 
DEBT  shows  that  higher  debt/GDP  ratio  reduce  fiscal  authority  credibility.  Thus, 
difficulties in stabilizing the debt/GDP ratio generate loss of fiscal credibility. The DEBT 
coefficients present  statistical  significance in  GMM  and TOBIT estimates.  The AMD 
and  INDEX  variables  present  positive  influence  over  FCI.  Increases  in  the  average 
maturity helps to reduce the risk of refinancing the public debt and then improve fiscal 
credibility. The result for the indexation profile implies fiscal authority can benefit of a 
good  quality  of  indexation.  When  the  INDEX  increases,  it  also  increases  the  fiscal 
credibility. Moreover, the basic interest rate (IR) presents negative signal in the results. 
When central bank rises the basic interest rate, it increases the cost of the public debt, 
reducing the fiscal credibility.  

In  this  sense,  the  evidence  shows  that  the  measures  adopted  by  the  National 
Treasury regarding the composition of public debt and lengthening the period of maturity 
of public debt contributed to increase fiscal credibility. Thus, the findings corroborate the 
arguments  and  recommendations  of  Calvo  and  Guidotti  (1990),  Giavazzi  and  Pagano 
(1990) and Giavazzi and Missale (2004). 

 

3.4 Estimations related to monetary policy credibility 
 

Aiming  to  explain  what  drives  monetary  policy  credibility  as  well  as  to  verify 
whether fiscal credibility is important for central bank credibility, we estimate equation 5 
below: 
 

  

 

Table 3 presents  the estimates. The reported t-statistics in the OLS estimates are 
based on the estimator of Newey and West (1987). The results do not present problems 
of specification. In terms of GMM11 estimation, the J-statistic indicates that we cannot 
reject the hypothesis that the instrument selection is correctly specified. The Durbin-Wu-
Hausman test indicate the regressors are exogenous.   

The results presents expected signals according to the literature. The positive signal 
for IR and the negative signal for INFD corroborate the idea of Blinder (2000) that the 
history  of  honesty  and  the  act  of  fighting  against  inflation  are  important  to  build 
credibility. The inflation deviation has negative influence over central bank credibility. 
When  the  inflation  deviates  from  the  target  it  represents  lacks  of  commitment  of  the 
central bank with the monetary policy goals and then reduce central bank credibility. In 
turn,  the  results  indicate  that  an  increase  in  the  basic  interest  rate  (IR)  signals  the 
commitment of the central bank to keep inflation under control and thus increases central 
bank credibility. Thus, to rise the interest rates is to fight against inflation and its helps 
central bankers to be credible. The D_ER variable also presents a negative relation with

Regarding OLS estimates, due to the problems of autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity, the reported t-
statistics in the OLS estimates are based on the estimator of Newey and West (1987). 

 

The FCI presents positive signal to all methods. This positive signal implies fiscal 
credibility can help to build central bank credibility. Fiscal credibility is related with the 
capacity  of  the  fiscal  authority  to  honor  its  debts  providing  public  debt  sustainability. 
Thus, the positive signals indicate when the fiscal authority is committed to a sound fiscal 
policy it helps to increase the central bank credibility. This result reinforces the argument 
of King (1995) that fiscal discipline enhances monetary policy credibility. This result also 

puts  light  in  the  fiscal  dominance  theory.  If  the  fiscal  authority  increases  it  debts  and 
deteriorate the confidence public has on the public debt sustainability, it will reduce the 
central bank credibility.  

Thus, the results indicate that when there is a commitment of the monetary authority 

and government with their goals, an increase in central bank credibility is verified. 
 
3.5 Systems of simultaneous equations  

 
Based  on  evidence  found  in  the  estimations  above,  fiscal  discipline  and  the 
policies  adopted  by  the  National  Treasury  in  terms  of  public  debt  management  are 
important to increase fiscal credibility. In turn, fiscal credibility and the commitment of 
the  monetary  authority  with  price  stability  are  important  to  enhance  central  bank 
credibility.  In  this  sense,  the  conduct  of  economic  policies  and  the  behavior  of 
policymakers are important  for macroeconomic stability and, thus,  to build both  fiscal 
credibility and central bank credibility.  

A way of testing the validity of the equations and coefficients previously achieved 
is through system of equations. For treating possible problems of endogeneity, the use of 
system  of  equations  which  applies  GMM  is  adequate  for  estimating  non-biased 
coefficients. Thus, in  order to  give robustness  for the results presented in the previous 
sections, one systems of equations are estimated12 with equation (4) and (5):  

 

 

  

 
 
The results presented in table 4 corroborate the previous findings. All coefficients 
present  the  same  signal  and  statistical  significance.  The  J-test  indicate  the  instruments 
respect the orthogonality restriction. Hence, the evidences provided by the GMM system 
provide robustness to previous results.  

Regarding  the  estimates  presented  in  Table  4,  all  coefficients  presented  the 
expected signs and statistical significance. The estimates show the importance of public 
debt  management  and  government  commitment  with  fiscal  targets  for  building  fiscal 
credibility. In other words, the improvement in the composition of public debt, a more 
extended period of maturity of public debt  and the commitment with  the fiscal  targets 
contributed  to  the  increase  of  fiscal  credibility.  Regarding  the  determinants  of  central 
bank  credibility,  the  findings  corroborate  those  already  found  and,  in  particular,  the 
estimates of the systems reveal,  as well as in the individual estimates, the influence of 
fiscal credibility on central bank credibility. 

 

4. Conclusion 
 

Since  the  adoption  of  inflation  targeting  by  several  developed  and  developing 
countries,  and  the  recognition  that  credibility  matters  not  only  in  theory  but  also,  in 
especially,  in  practice,  academics  and  policymakers  share  a  common  concern:  how  to 
build credibility.

This study investigates the determinants of both fiscal credibility and central bank 
credibility  in  Brazil.  The  findings  suggest  that  since  2002,  the  National  Treasury  has 
promoted improvements in public debt management that were important to build fiscal 
credibility: the improvement in the indexation profile and the lengthening of the country’s 
average  debt  maturity.  The  analysis  showed  the  commitment  with  an  appropriate  debt 
management and responsible fiscal policies are important to build fiscal credibility. 

Regarding  central  bank  credibility,  the  analysis  showed  that  inflation  deviations 
from  the  target  and  currency  devaluations  have  a  negative  effect  on  central  bank 
credibility. In turn, increases in the basic interest rate show the public the commitment of 
the central bank with a specified inflation. 

Moreover,  a  relevant  finding  obtained  through  the  empirical  analysis  is  the 
influence of fiscal credibility on central bank credibility, i.e., fiscal credibility is important 
to  build  central  bank  credibility.  In  other  words,  when  agents  form  expectations  that 
public debt is under control, these expectations end up influencing inflation expectations.
