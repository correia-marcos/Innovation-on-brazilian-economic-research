RESUMO: 
 

Com a recente urbanização e aumento da densidade demográfica em torno das grandes cidades brasileiras, 
o mercado imobiliário do país sofreu uma grande valorização. Além de fatores relacionados à demanda, 
mecanismos com potencial para limitar a oferta de casas também podem ter afetado o aumento de preços 
nesse mercado. O objetivo do presente trabalho é investigar o impacto das ordens de zoneamento (restrições 
de uso do solo) sobre a média do preço de alugueis e sobre o crescimento do estoque de casas. Através de 
uma análise entre cidades e utilizando algoritmos de matching, observou-se que o zoneamento gera um 
incremento que varia de 5,4% a 6,3% no preço médio de aluguéis, mas não afeta o crescimento de casas. 
Além  disso,  conduzimos  análises  de  sensibilidade  que  sugerem  que  esse  resultado  não  é  simplesmente 
guiado  por  confounders  não  observáveis.  Nossa  evidência  sugere  que  mesmo  sendo  uma  política  bem 
intencionada, o zoneamento tende a gerar custos sociais que precisam ser considerados.

ABSTRACT: 

Due to recent urbanization and the increased population density around major Brazilian cities, the real estate 
market in the country suffered a great appreciation. In addition to demand-related factors, mechanisms with 
potential to limit housing supply may have also affected the price increase in that market. The objective of 
this study is to investigate the impact of zoning orders (land use regulations) on the average rent prices and 
the real estate market growth in Brazil. Through an intercity analysis and using matching methods, it was 
observed  that  zoning  generates  an  increment  ranging  from  5.4%  to  6.3%  in  average  rents,  but  does  not 
affect the house growth. In addition, we conducted sensitivity analysis that suggests that this result is not 
simply  driven  by  unobservable  confounders.  Our  evidence  suggests  that  even  being  a  usually  well-
intentioned policy, zoning tends to generate social costs that need to be  taken into account in the analysis 
of the real estate market in Brazil.

1. Introduction 

 
In  recent  decades,  a  sharp  increase  in  population  concentration  took  place  in  major  Brazilian 
metropolitan areas, continuing the rapid urbanization process that has been occurring in Brazil over the last 
century. For example, the population density of the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo grew 12.7% between 
2000 and 2010. In new metropolitan areas such as Brasilia and Goiania, the population density increased 
by 23.7% and 22.7%, respectively (Brazilian Demographic Census 2010). Due to higher population density 
around cities and macroeconomic stability, which increased housing credit, the Brazilian real estate market 
underwent a price boom. According to the Fipe Zap index, which measures the selling price of properties 
and rentals in main Brazilian cities on a monthly basis, from 2010 to 2015, housing prices increased 223.5% 
in  Sao  Paulo,  whereas  rents  increased  at  a  rate  of  100.8%.  This  variation  was  significantly  higher  than 
inflation in the same period, which reached 54.6% (measured by IPCA).   
In addition to demand-related factors, supply-related factors such as the higher cost of  real estate 
 
development and the restrictions in urban land use may have also a connection with this great appreciation 
of the Brazilian real estate market. One of the main ways to regulate and restrict urban land use in Brazil is 
through zoning ordinances. Zoning ordinances are instruments of urban planning and management which 
are usually established by local governments and can regulate both the type of use (establishing residential 
areas,  commercial areas, industrial  or mixed)  and the intensity  of  use,  to  restrict  the  size,  the  weight  of 
buildings  or  the  flood-area  ratio  (McDonald  and  McMillen  2012).  Note  that,  in  addition  to  traditional 
zoning, there are other regulations that can be used to restrict urban land use, such as the minimum lot size 
requirements,  rules  governing  septic  systems,  subdivision  requirements,  wetland  regulations,  green  area 
requirements and others (Fischel, 2004; Glaeser and Ward, 2009). 
 
In Brazil, local governments (municipalities) are in charge of the adoption and the management of 
land use controls. These instruments have gained greater relevance in the late 70s and thus became regulated 
by  federal  laws.  For  example,  in  1979,  a  federal  law  that  regulates  urban  land  parceling  (Federal  Law 
6766/79) came into force. A key feature of this law is that it establishes a minimum lot of 125 square meters 
and, in addition, delegates to municipalities the autonomy to set their own guidelines for the allotment and 
the  breakup  of  land.    In  2001,  the  federal  government  created  the  “Estatuto  da  Cidade”  (Federal  Law 
10257/01), a law that established general urban guidelines and the obligation of master plans for a set of 
municipalities. In this context of federal regulation on urban planning instruments, a large increase in the 
number of municipalities that have their own zoning ordinance occurred: in 1978, only 64 municipalities 
had regulations for the urban land; in 2013, this number rose to 1,724 (Munic 2013). Despite the recent 
increase in the adoption of these regulations,  little is known about their impact on the Brazilian housing 
market. In this study, we will take advantage of the variability of the law between the municipalities to 
assess their impact on the average rental prices and on the real estate market growth. 
 
According to McDonald and McMillen (2012), the objective of the supporters of the law is to protect 
the residents' well-being from the adverse effects of industrialization, rapid and intense urbanization and 
high-impact  buildings.  Therefore,  zoning  would  be  useful  to  reduce  the  negative  externalities  that  are 
associated with certain types of land use or degrees of use. However, by restricting the land use and limiting 
new  developments,  urban  zoning  ends  up  bringing  changes  to  the  land  market  and  consequently  may 
increase the prices of existing buildings and residences (Quigley 2007; McDonald  and McMillen 2012). 
Thus, it creates a great incentive for homeowners to support, defend and claim for zoning laws (or other 
restriction instruments) with the aim of increasing the price of their houses, even in the absence of actual 
negative externalities (Quigley 2007; Fischel 2004).   

A large number of empirical studies investigates the impact of zoning and land use restrictions on 
the  housing  and  urban  land  market.  Quigley  and  Rosenthal  (2005),  Quigley  (2007)  and  McDonald  and 
McMillen  (2012)  make  a  detailed  review  of  these  studies.  Even  with  different  empirical  strategies  and 
analyzing  different  metropolitan areas  in the  United  States,  these  papers  show  a  similar  conclusion:  the 
degree of land use restrictiveness is positively correlated with property price and negatively correlated with 
new real estate developments (Quigley and Raphael 2005; Ihlanfeldt 2007, Glaeser and Ward 2009; Zabel 
and  Dalton  2011).  Additionally,  there  is evidence  that  lot  price is  higher  in  more regulated  areas  (Kok, 

Monkkonen and Quigley 2014) and that cities with more strict regulation suffer from a greater amplitude 
in the house price cycle, with more intense booms and bursts (Huang and Tang 2012).    

The  major  empirical  challenge  of  those  papers  is  to  solve  the  potential  endogeneity  in  the 
relationship between zoning and real estate prices. Typically, to overcome this problem, some studies add 
a wide range of control variables (Glaeser and Ward 2009 and Kok, Monkkonen and Quigley 2014), add 
fixed-effects  (Zabel  and  Dalton  2011)  or  employ  an  instrumental  variable  approach  (Ihlanfeldt  2007). 
However, not all omitted variables can be measured or are fixed in time, which weakens the first approach. 
Moreover, it is extremely difficult to find an instrument that satisfies the exclusion restriction. For example, 
Ihlanfeldt  (2007)  received  criticism  for  using  past  demographic  characteristics  as  an  instrument  to  the 
current level of land use restrictiveness. It turns out that past demographics can be correlated with other 
current characteristics  that affect  property price, weakening the exclusion restriction (Glaeser  and Ward 
2009). In addition to this unresolved empirical difficulty, another limitation of those studies is that they 
focus  only  on  the  US  housing  market.  However,  due  to  the  recent  urbanization  process,  the  real  estate 
market  of  developing  economies  can  behave  in  a  very  divergent  way  (Alterman  2013),  so  that  the 
conclusions of such papers cannot be easily extended to these countries.  

This  paper  contributes  by  analyzing  the  Brazilian  case,  where,  unlike  the  United  States,  the 
urbanization process only took off in the second half of the twentieth century. In addition, this study deals 
with endogeneity in a different way: rather than trying to solve the problem thoroughly, we will evaluate 
how  robust  is  our  evidence  in  the  presence  of  endogeneity  caused  by  omitted  variables.  In  this  sense, 
considering our goal of investigating the effect of zoning in average rent prices and in the real estate market 
growth,  we  employ  a  Propensity  Score  Matching  (PSM)  estimator  and  sensibility  analysis  proposed  by 
Rosenbaum (2002) and by Ichino, Mealli and Nannicini (2008). Furthermore, another contribution of our 
study is to use a measure of rental prices, which is adjusted by the property’s characteristics. Our results 
reveal that municipalities that adopt zoning as an urban planning policy have an average rental price 5.4% 
to 6.26% higher than that of similar municipalities that do not adhere to the order. A sensitivity analysis 
based on Rosenbaum bounds indicates that for our evidence to be invalidated there must be an unobservable 
variable that increases the odds in zoning adoption by 90% and is strongly correlated with the rental price. 
Moreover, the sensitivity analysis proposed by Inchino et al. (2008) shows that even if there are important 
confounders, our result remains valid. Thus, the sensitivity tests point that our evidence is not driven by 
endogeneity.  Additionally,  we also found that the zoning  law is not able to affect the  real estate market 
growth, suggesting that higher rental prices are not simply a reflection of a lower housing supply. 

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we discuss the evidence of previous literature that 
assess  the  impact  of  land  use  restrictions  in  the  perspective  of  developing  economies.  In  Section  3,  we 
present the institutional background and the origins of zoning in Brazilian municipalities. Section 4 details 
the  empirical  strategy.  Section  5  describes  the  data, the  covariates  and the  procedure  for  constructing  a 
constant quality rental price; Section 6 presents the main results and robustness tests and, finally, Section 7 
presents the final considerations. 
 
2. Zoning in developing countries: empirical evidence 

In  developing  and  recently  urbanized  countries,  policies  that  restrict  land  use  or  that  control  the 
intensity  of  use  have  consequences  on  the  housing  market  that  can  differ  substantially  in  relation  to 
developed  countries’  markets  (Alterman  2013).  Firstly,  strict  regulations  with  low  enforcement  power 
(which is common in developing countries)  may  generate a low level of compliance and therefore little 
influence in land and property prices. In addition, stricter regulations - by increasing the price of real estate 
development and reducing the supply elasticity of available lots - can cause an additional incentive to low-
income households decide to enter in the informal housing market and, thus, there is an increase in slums 
formation and in the number of low quality settlements (Cavalcanti and Da Mata 2013). Furthermore, the 
motivations for the regulation can  also be different. For example, in countries with lower income levels, 
the land-use restrictions can be used as a way to prevent strong densities, which could generate an overload 
in the poor urban infrastructure (Brueckner and Lall 2015). 

In a study conducted for Argentina, Monkkonen and Ronconi (2013) detected that in municipalities 
with more stringent regulations, both the level of compliance and the price lots were smaller. Although the 

negative correlation between the restrictions in urban land use and prices is counterintuitive in the face of 
the US cities’ evidence, the authors argue that by stimulating the growth of low quality houses and slums, 
land-use  restrictions  cause  negative  externalities  in  the  neighborhood  and,  therefore,  the  lots  suffer 
devaluation. In a descriptive study for the Offinso South Municipality, in Ghana,  Boamah (2013) shows 
that the land-use regulations have little practical effect, since most of the developers do not  comply with 
the order. According to the author, this is a common situation in African cities and it happens because the 
planning laws have a low enforcement level, are poorly adapted to local conditions and are guided by public 
offices with high levels of corruption. Similar results  were found by  Arimah and  Adeagbo (2000) for a 
Nigerian city. 

Although the low applicability of planning laws is an important point in the debate about the effects 
of  zoning  in  cities  in  developing  countries,  the  consequences  regarding  housing  affordability  and  slum 
formation have an even greater importance on the well-being of citizens. According to UN-Habitat (2003), 
about  30%  of  the  world's  urban  population  lives  in  slums,  where,  due  to  the  poor  condition  of  public 
infrastructure and low-quality housing, the quality of life of dwellers is very low. Some studies sought to 
verify the impact of the land-use restrictions on the growth of the informal housing market, considering the 
Brazilian case. In this sense, Biderman (2007) argues that the formal housing market is very connected to 
the informal ones. The author also shows evidence that there has been an increase in informality in Brazilian 
municipalities that have adopted zoning rules in the 1990s. More recently, Cavalcanti and Da Mata (2013), 
through a structural general equilibrium model, show that much of the 1980-2010 slum growth in Brazil is 
connected with rural-urban migration, with an increase in income levels and in the restrictiveness of land-
use regulations. 

Perceiving that land-use restrictions can increase house prices and, thus, worsen the welfare of poor 
households, some governments use inclusionary zoning as a way to generate affordable housing. However, 
despite  being  well  intentioned,  this  policy  does  not  always  attain  the  desired  effects.    For  example, 
investigating Brazilian cities, Lall, Wang, and Da Mata (2007) show that in municipalities that have adopted 
urban policies targeted at reducing the minimum lot size, there was an increase in the formal housing supply 
and  an  increase  in  population  growth  (via  migration).  Once  the  population  growth  was  higher  than  the 
formal housing growth, the policy also caused an undesirable effect: an increase in slum formation. This 
evidence is in line with the work of  Schuetz, Meltzer and Been (2011) showing that policies that aim to 
produce affordable houses through inclusionary zoning can also generate the opposite effect: higher prices 
and lower production rates.    

  

 

 

 

At this point, it is necessary to recognize that as one of the main instruments for urban planning, 
land-use restrictions and zoning affect many other aspects of the cities’ dynamics, going far beyond the 
effects  on  the  housing  market.    In  a  study  for  Indian  cities,  Brueckner  and  Sridhar  (2012)  found  that 
municipalities with stricter building height limits have larger spatial sizes. The authors show that a unity 
increasing in the floor-are ratio (FAR) limit can generate a reduction of approximately 20% of the area of 
an average city, which generates a yearly savings in commuting costs of about 0.7% of the annual income 
of a typical household.   

As can be seen by the above discussion, the majority of empirical studies focuses on assessing the 
impact of the urban land regulations on indirect outcomes, such as the informal housing market. However, 
for regulations to affect this type of market,  it is first necessary to prove that regulations also affect the 
prices of the formal housing market. Without this, the previous evidence is not very credible. Regarding 
the Brazilian case, little is known about the consequences of zoning in relation to rental prices or property 
prices. As far as we know, the study of Duarte, Silveira-Neto and Sampaio (2015) for the city of Recife 
(the center of the fourth largest metropolitan urban area of Brazil) is the only exception. More specifically, 
the authors investigated the price effect of a law that restricts the height of the buildings in a particular area 
of the city. Through a Differences-in-Differences strategy, the authors showed that the new ordinance had 
caused an increase of about 6% in the price of properties located in the area in which the ordinance was 
implemented. However, since this paper analyzes a municipal policy made for a relatively small area, it 
lacks external validity. In order to generalize the effect of land-use restrictions in Brazil, it is necessary to 
investigate the problem in a broader perspective. This study aims to fill this gap. 
 

3. Zoning and Urban Planning in Brazil: Historical and Institutional Background. 

 
Brazil is a country with relatively recent urbanization: in 1940, only 31.2% of the population lived 
in urban areas. That number grew throughout the century, rising to 84.3% in 2010 (Census 2010). This 
rapid urbanization process, linked to the industrialization of the country, brought a number of problems for 
the Brazilian cities. Not surprisingly, it becomes necessary to introduce some urban planning instruments. 
In Brazil, because of its federative character, the local governments (municipal level) are responsible for 
creating  and  establish  their  own  planning  laws.  It  was  only  at  the  end  of  the  1970s  that  the  federal 
government has assumed a coordinating role in urban issues involving municipalities. 

Initially,  the  first  urban  regulations  used  in  the  country  consisted  in  building  codes  and  limited 
ordinances. They were deployed in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo in the late nineteenth century, 
and, in many cases, resembled zoning rules with a more restricted coverage area. These instruments were 
demanded by high-income population, who used it as a way to defend their properties’ value against the 
aggravation of the problems generated by industrialization (Borges 2007). For example, the posture codes 
of Sao Paulo, created in 1886, prohibited the construction of low-income and working houses in the city's 
commerce  perimeter  (Nery  Júnior  2013).  It  was  only  in  the  1930s  that  urban  regulations  started  being 
disseminated to other Brazilian cities, such as Recife and Porto Alegre, but were still not comprehensive 
enough, and thus did not constitute a general rule of zoning. 

In the mid-1970s, a spread of general zoning ordinances took place. A milestone is the introduction 
of  the  law  7805/72  in  São  Paulo  city,  which,  among  other  things,  covered  the  whole  territory  of  the 
municipality and instituted exclusively residential areas and commerce corridors (Nery Júnior 2013). Figure 
1 shows the evolution in the number of municipalities that adopted their own zoning ordinance: in 1960, 
for example, only six cities had land use regulations.

In addition, it can be observed that, from the 198s on, there has been a great increase in the number 
of municipalities that have adopted zoning as an urban management instrument. Several interrelated factors 
can explain this growth. Firstly, it may be a natural consequence of the ongoing urbanization process in the 
country:  in  1980,  about  67.5%  of  the  population  already  lived  in  urban  areas.  Moreover,  in  line  with 
Gyourko, Saiz, and Summers (2008), the increase in wealth and education of Brazilian citizens can explain 
a greater awareness of the intensity and the use of the urban land. At that time, some institutional changes 
in  the  country  were  also  associated  with greater  diffusion  of  zoning  among  municipalities.  In  1979, the 
federal  government  took  on  a  coordinating  role  of  urban  policy  in  cities.  In  this  sense,  the  Federal  law 
6799/79 came into force, establishing general rules and guidelines for the division of urban land. This law 
also established the minimum lot size of 125 square meters, delegating to municipalities the option to adopt 
stricter  criteria.  Furthermore,  in  1988,  a  new  federal  constitution  was  created,  which,  because  of  its 

decentralized characteristics, favored the autonomy of the municipalities in formulating their own public 
policies and the management of fiscal resources. 

Due to intense city growth and to rural-urban movements, there was a strong increase in housing 
demand  without a  counterpart  of  the  supply,  causing  a  rise  in the  housing  deficit1  and  the  formation  of 
slums across the country. To alleviate this problem, and realizing that the urban land restrictions can cause 
higher housing prices, some municipalities have adopted a kind of inclusionary zoning: the Special Zones 
of Social Interest (ZEIS)2. These are constituted of demarcated areas within the cities with more flexible 
and more specific rules regarding zoning. Other important institutional framework for the country's urban 
planning policy is the approval of the Federal Law 10257/01, known as “Estatuto da Cidade” which, among 
other things, emphasizes the social function of property, encourages participatory planning and enforces 
the adoption of a city master plan by a set of municipalities. This federal law may also have driven the 
strong adoption of  zoning by the cities in the most recent period, from 2000 to 2013, where 1,013 new 
municipalities have adopted the order (figure 1). 

Note that, although the zoning ordinances are present in 1,724 Brazilian municipalities (about 31% 
of the total), little is known about their impact on the formal housing market.  In this work, we will take 
advantage of the variability of orders between the municipalities to verify the impact of land-use regulations 
on average rents and on the real estate market growth. 

 

4. Empirical Strategy 

4.1 Propensity Score Matching 

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of municipal zoning policies on average rent prices 
and on the real estate market growth. The great empirical challenge of this kind of analysis is to eliminate 
the possibility of endogeneity by reverse causality and by omitted variables. Although it is assumed that 
property  prices  can  be  explained  by  zoning  ordinances,  the  reverse  way  is  also  possible:  maybe  zoning 
occurs just in areas that have more highly valued houses (Quigley, 2007).  To reduce these concerns, we 
will apply a matching-based strategy in conjunction with a series of sensitivity analyses.  

In this sense, our goal is to make a match between treated observations (municipalities that have 
implemented zoning ordinances) and the control observations3 (municipalities that have not adopted zoning 
ordinances)  such  that  the control  group  can  be  considered  a  counterfactual  -  what  would  happen  to  the 
treatment group  had they not adopted  zoning. Consider 𝑍 a binary  variable that describes zoning. Thus, 
𝑍 = 1  if  the  municipality  has  implemented  the  ordinance  and 𝑍 = 0  otherwise.  𝑌0  and  𝑌1  describe  the 
potential  outcomes  that  vary  according  to  the  treatment  (zoning  order).  In  real  life,  only  one  of  these 
outcomes  can  be  actually  observed  for  each  municipality.  However,  the  causal  effect  is  defined  as  the 
difference  between  𝑌1  and  𝑌0.  We  are  interested  in  obtaining  an  estimate  of  the  average  effect  of  the 
treatment on the treated (ATT), defined as follows: 

 

𝐴𝑇𝑇 = 𝐸(𝑌1 − 𝑌0|𝑍 = 1)                                                                                                                        (1) 

Under a set of assumptions, various methods can be used to estimate the ATT. One of these is the 
Propensity Score Matching (PSM) developed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983). The propensity score is the 
probability of receiving the treatment (in our case, implementing a zoning ordinance) given the observed 
covariates (defined as the 𝑋 vector), i.e. 𝑃(𝑋) = 𝑃(𝑍 = 1|𝑋). The key identification assumption for the 
ATT is that 𝑌1 and 𝑌0 are independents of 𝑍 given 𝑃(𝑋). In other words, 𝑌1,𝑌0 ⊥ 𝑍|𝑃(𝑋). This is known as 
Conditional Independence Assumption (CIA). Additionally, it is also necessary that, for each treated unit, 
a matched control unit with similar 𝑋 exists. This assumption is known as overlap condition, and can be 

                                                             
1  According to calculations of the João Pinheiro Foundation (2010), the housing deficit in Brazil is of 6,490 million housing units. 
 
2 920 municipalities adopt the ZEIS through specific legislation, while 1,556 municipalities include the ZEIS as a part of the  city master plan 
(MUNIC, 2013). 
 
3 In Figure 1A of Appendix, we show the spatial distribution of municipalities by zoning adoption. 

written  as:  0  < 𝑃(𝑍 = 1|𝑋) < 1.  Finally,  assuming  that  the  CIA  and  the  overlap  condition  holds,  the 
impact of zoning on the city's average rental price which implemented the ordinance is given by: 

 

𝜏𝐴𝑇𝑇 = 𝐸(𝑌1 − 𝑌0|𝑍 = 1) = 𝐸[𝐸(𝑌1 − 𝑌0|𝑃(𝑋), 𝑍 = 1)]

= 𝐸[𝐸(𝑌1|𝑃(𝑋), 𝑍 = 1) −  𝐸(𝑌0|𝑃(𝑋), 𝑍 = 0)|𝑍 = 1 ]                                          (2) 

That  is,  under  these  assumptions,  we  can  use  the  outcomes  of  matched  control  municipalities  as  a 
counterfactual  for  the  estimation  of  ATT.    A  two-step  procedure  is  employed  to  obtain  an  empirical 
counterpart of (2). Firstly, a probabilistic regression model is estimated to get the propensity scores, 𝑃(𝑋). 
Second, based on algorithms, we make a match between the treated and non-treated municipalities which 
have a similar propensity score. For robustness purposes, we will apply three types of matching algorithms 
commonly  used  in  the  empirical  literature:  the  nearest  neighbor,  the  radius  matching  and  the  kernel 
matching. Caliendo and Kopeinig (2008) describe these algorithms in detail and discuss the advantages and 
disadvantages (in terms of bias and efficiency) of each one. 

4.2 The plausibility of the CIA and sensitivity analysis 

The  CIA  assumption  implies  that  the  adoption  of  zoning  is  completely  explained  by  observable 
variables. That is, the matching procedure is constructed by using all covariates that generate differences 
in the distribution of treated and non-treated units, making the probability of treatment equal between the 
matched pairs, as if there had been a random assignment (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2008). Thus, it is essential 
that the vector 𝑋 contain detailed information on the relevant characteristics of municipalities, which will 
be  possible  with  the  Brazilian  Demographic  Census  and  the  Survey  of  Basic  Municipal  Information 
(MUNIC). We will describe the variables used to obtain the propensity score in the next subsection.  
 
However, even with detailed information on the municipalities, there is a possibility that the CIA is 
not  valid  due  to  the  existence  of  unobservable  variables  (confounders)  that  affect  both  the  adoption  of 
zoning and the outcome variable. The existence of confounders can  make the ATT estimator biased and 
therefore hardly credible - this is the weakness of PSM strategies. Although the CIA is, by construction, a 
non-testable assumption and the absence of confounders is little convincing, we can - through a sensitivity 
analysis – either evaluate the strength that an omitted variable must have to invalidate our ATT estimate or 
simulate  potential  confounders.  In  this  sense,  we  will  use  two  different  kinds  of  sensitivity  analysis 
(Rosenbaum,  2002  and  Inchino  et  al.  2008)  to  verify  the  robustness  of  the  ATT  when  the  Conditional 
Independence Assumption fails. 
 
Firstly, we will apply the sensitivity analysis developed by Rosenbaum (2002), which  provides an 
indication  of  the  magnitude  of  the  omitted  variable  bias  that  would  be  necessary  to  invalidate  the 
associations  initially  observed  by  the  estimated  ATT.  This  method  is  based  on  the  parameter Γ,  which 
measures the difference in odds of receiving the treatment between observations with the same observable 
characteristics.  Therefore,  a  random  experiment  ensures Γ = 1,  and  when  that  Γ  grows,  the  experiment 
becomes more distant from randomization. For example, in an observational study, if  Γ = 3, then one of 
the units has three times as likely to receive the treatment due to unobservable factors, since the treated and 
untreated units are identical regarding the observable variables. Thus, the basic procedure for Rosenbaum 
sensitivity analysis is to select a series of Γ values and, for each one, calculate a bound of significance level 
(p-values) for the ATT in the case of a endogenous treatment selection (Diprete and Gangl 2004). 
 
In addition, we will also apply a sensitivity analysis proposed by Ichino et al. (2008). This strategy 
aims to verify the bias of the estimated ATT when the CIA fails in some specific and relevant way. First, it 
is  necessary  to  establish  values  for  the  parameters  that  characterize  the  distribution  of  a  specific 
confounding  factor,  denoted  by 𝑈.  It’s  assumed  that  this  variable  is  binary,  independent  and  identically 
distributed.  Thus,  the  distribution  of  𝑈 is  completely  characterized  by  the  choice  of  four  parameters, 
denoted by 𝑝𝑖𝑗: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

𝑝𝑖𝑗 ≡ Pr (𝑈 = 1|𝑍 = 𝑖, 𝐼(𝑌 > 𝑦̅) = 𝑗)                                                                                            (3) 

Where 𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ {0,1}, 𝐼  is  an  indication  function and  𝑦̅  is  the  mean  of  the  outcome  variable.  Based  on  the 
parameters defined by (3), a value of 𝑈 is given for each treated and control observation in accordance to 
one of the four groups to which the observation belongs. The simulated 𝑈 is considered as a new observable 
covariate and is then included in the set of variables used for the matching process.  Finally, the ATT  is 
computed  again  with  the  inclusion  of  confounder 𝑈.  Therefore,  by  modifying  the  parameters  that 
characterize the distribution of  𝑈, we can evaluate the robustness of the ATT against different assumption 
related to the nature of confound factor (Nannicini, 2007).  
We will follow the simulation exercises proposed by Ichino et al. (2008) and choose 𝑝𝑖𝑗 in order to 
 
make the confounder distribution similar to the empirical distribution of important covariates.  Furthermore, 
the confounders will be simulated to be threatening to the baseline ATT: will have positive correlation with 
the treatment status variable (𝑍) and with the outcome of non-treated units. 

 

 

 

 

 

5. Variables and Data 

This section describes the construction and choices of the variables that will be used to implement 
the  empirical  strategy  discussed  above.  More  specifically,  in  subsection  5.1,  we  discuss  the  database 
employed in the paper and the main motivations for the covariate choices. Moreover, in the subsection 5.2, 
we will argue over the importance and the procedure to discount the property attributes from the respective 
rental price, in order to get a cleaner outcome variable. 

5.1 Database and Covariates 

 

As  previously  discussed,  our  empirical  strategy  will  take  advantage  of  the  fact  that  some 
municipalities have adopted zoning ordinance while others do not. Information on urban policies that each 
city adopts are obtained from the survey of Basic Municipal Information (MUNIC), a database elaborated 
annually  by  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics  (IBGE)  to  gather  information  on  the 
dynamics, structure and functioning of local institutions. Thus, our treatment variable is dichotomous and 
takes the value of one if the municipality had a zoning law in 20044, and takes the value of zero otherwise. 
For robustness purposes, we also employ other treatment variable that measures the degree of rigidity of 
the minimum lot size endorsed by the municipality. It will  take the value of one in the case of the local 
administration set a minimum lot size greater than 125 m² and zero otherwise. 
Regarding the outcome variables, we will use two throughout the paper: the average rental prices 
 
(measured in 2010 and adjusted by the property quality) and the growth of formal houses in the 2000-2010 
period. We will follow the Caliendo  and Kopeing (2008) recommendation, and add only covariates that 
simultaneously affect the outcomes and the zoning adoption. To ensure that these variables are not directly 
affected  by  the  treatment,  they  will  be  fixed  in  time  or  measured  before  the  treatment  (year  2000).  The 
outcomes and the control variables were obtained from the Brazilian Demographic Census of 2000 and 
2010. It is necessary to point out that since our outcome variable was measured only in 2010, it is impossible 
to build a panel database. 
 
The  choice  of  the  control  variables  that  will  be  used  to  proceed  with  the  matching  between  the 
municipalities that adopt zoning and those that do not adopt was based on recent empirical literature (e.g. 
Ihlanfeldt 2007, Glaeser  and Ward 2009; Zabel  and Dalton 2011; Monkkonen and Ronconi 2013; Kok, 
Monkkonen and Quigley 2014). We split the covariates into five - not mutually exclusive - sets: I) Demand 
Factors:  characteristics  that  drive  the  intense  use  of  urban  land,  such  as  population  density,  population 
growth (1991-2000) and per capita income; II) Externalities Factors: activities that inflict damage to the 
natural and social environment of cities, causing greater pressure for the adoption of urban planning laws, 
which include urbanization and industrialization rate; III) Demographics: since the zoning orders are set by 
municipal legislators, local citizens have a strong influence on the conduction of urban policy. In this sense, 
we include the following variables: average years of schooling, the percentage of blacks, of working age, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                             
4  We opted to choose this particular year because the information available in the MUNIC 2004 is consistent with each consulted 
local zoning order. Information about zoning are also collected in MUNIC 1999, 2005 and 2009. However, for these surveys 
there is some degree of disagreement with the local zoning orders. Anyway, in section 6.3, we will evaluate the robustness of 
the results to changes in the treatment assigned in the 1999, 2005 and 2009 MUNIC. 

immigrants,  voter’s  turnout  and  percentage  of  homeowners;  IV)  Urban  Infrastructure:  as  discussed  in 
section 2, policies that restrict the urban land use can be simply a way to avoid high densities in places with 
poor  urban  infrastructure,  thus  we  include  the  following  variables  in  the  control  set:  percentage  of 
households  with  sewage,  with  electricity  and  pipe  water;  V)  Environmental  and  Fixed  Factors:  urban 
planning can also be established in order to protect the natural and cultural heritage from the real estate 
development. Thereby, cities that have coastline, units of natural conservation or historical-cultural capital 
may be more likely to adopt zoning orders. Therefore, we will use the year the city was founded as a proxy 
for the historical-cultural capital, coastline and conservation area dummies, and finally, the distance to the 
nearest capital city. In addition to these sets of covariates, we will also include state-fixed effects in the 
propensity score estimation. The use of this broad set of variables that characterize the municipalities aims 
to make the distribution of treated and untreated municipalities as similar as possible. However, it is very 
likely that there are  unobservables that affect the zoning assignment. Our argument in this study is that 
these variables are not important enough to invalidate our results. In the next section, we will discuss the 
main evidence of the work. 
 
5.2 Constructing constant quality rental prices 
 

An  important  concern  in  our  analysis  is  the  possibility  that  zoning  occurs  in  cities  with  better 
housing standards.  In this case, a positive relationship between zoning and average rental price could reflect 
only  a  simple  association  between  prices  and  their  hedonic  attributes.  In  this  study,  we  will  use  the 
correction proposed by Quigley and Raphael (2005), which seeks to adjust the rental prices in relation to 
property  characteristics.  This  strategy  aims  to  eliminate  the  influence  of  residences  attributes  of  their 
respective rental prices, in order to obtain an average rent that only reflects the city’s characteristics. 
 
Therefore, the first step is to estimate a hedonic regression for each Brazilian  municipality (5,507 
separate regressions), where the dependent variable is the rental price and the independent variables are the 
properties  characteristics  available  in  the  Demographic  Census  of  2010:  number  of  rooms,  number 
bathrooms, number of other rooms and a dummy that takes the value of one if the house is made of bricks 
and  zero,  otherwise  (Seabra and  Azzoni  2015).  The  dwelling  is  the  observation  unit  in this  analysis.  In 
Appendix, the Table A1 summarizes the mean of the estimated coefficients. As expected, all the hedonic 
characteristics affect the rental prices positively. The last step is to combine the estimated coefficients of 
each city with the average hedonic characteristics of Brazil, in order to estimate the average rental price 
with constant quality. This will be our main outcome variable.  

 

 

 

6. Results 
 

In  this  section,  we  will  present  and  discuss  the  results  obtained  by  applying  the  methodology 
described above. First, we will evaluate the matching quality and estimate the ATT considering different 
algorithms (subsection 6.1); then, we will conduct sensitivity analyses (subsection 6.2); and, finally, present 
some extensions and robustness checks (subsection 6.3). 
 
6.1 Baseline Results 
 

Table  1  shows  the  means  of  covariates  by  treatment  status  before  and  after  the  application  of 
matching procedure. Initially, we can see that cities that adopt zoning order are substantially different from 
those that do not.  For example, regulated cities have a higher per capita income, higher population density, 
are more urbanized, supply a better infrastructure, are closer to the state capital and also have more natural 
amenities. It is noted that the  mean difference for all observable characteristics is large and statistically 
significant between the two types of cities. This shows that a simple mean difference of rental price between 
municipalities with and without zoning is useless for impact evaluation. 

For this reason, is necessary to proceed with the matching between municipalities. The columns (5) 
and (6) of Table 1 show the covariates’ means after application of a nearest neighbor matching algorithm 
with replacement and imposing a common support. 35 treated municipalities (0.63% of the total group) 
were  outside  of  the  common  support  region  and,  therefore,  were  excluded.  We  can  see  that  after  the 
matching, the characteristics of both kinds of municipalities become very similar, so that  there were  no 
statistically significant differences5. This evidence suggests a good matching quality.

Table 2 summarizes the results of the propensity score estimation. We used a logit probability model 
with state fixed-effects. Although the choice of a probabilistic model is not critical to the ATT estimation, 
when compared to the probit function, the logit function has more density mass in the bounds (Caliendo 
and Kopeing 2008).  We note that most of the estimated coefficients take the expected signs based on what 
                                                             
5 We also use 27 state dummies to build the matching sample of Table 1. The results have been omitted for space constraints, but reveal that 
the mean difference (with respect to these variables) is not statistically significant between the two kinds of municipalities. 

has been discussed above and are consistent with the descriptive statistics of Table 1. Cities with higher 
income and more educated individuals are more likely to adopt zoning as an urban planning law, which 
conforms to Gyourko, Saiz, and Summers (2008). Areas that have a greater demand for land use (measured 
by population density), are more urbanized, which have a higher manufacturing share, and, a precarious 
urban infrastructure also adopt zoning more easily. This last fact suggests that, Brazilian cities may be using 
the zoning law as a legal instrument to limit development in areas with poor infrastructure.  Finally, the 
evidence in Table 2 also points a positive correlation between the use of zoning and the existence of natural 
amenities.

After obtaining the propensity scores, we will calculate the impact of zoning on the average rental 
prices  and  the  real  estate  market  growth  using  four  different  matching  algorithms.  Table  4  shows  the 
estimated ATT and the corresponding measures of matching quality suggested by Rosenbaum and Rubin 
(1983). In this case, the pseudo R² is obtained by estimating the propensity score using only the matched 
sample. It can be seen that for any of the matching algorithms, we obtain low values of pseudo R² and mean 
standardized  bias.  For  example,  considering  the  nearest  neighbor  algorithm  (column  (1)),  the  mean 
standardized bias dropped by about 90.8%6. These results support those obtained in Table 1, demonstrating 
that, in fact, it is perfectly possible to build groups of reasonably similar municipalities. 

The  estimated  ATTs  vary  from  0.054  to  0.062,  indicating  that  cities  that  adopt  zoning  as  urban 
planning policy have an average rent 5% higher compared to the non-adopters. This effect is substantial, 
since it  corresponds to about 12.46% of the unconditional difference of average rental between the two 
kinds of municipalities. Based on our discussion of Section 2, this evidence shows that the zoning orders 
drawn up by Brazilian municipalities have some level of  compliance. In addition, the positive impact of 
zoning on prices is also in line with the empirical literature that, when analyzing American cities, found

rent prices are corrected by their hedonic attributes (subsection 5.2).   

 
The panel B of Table 3 shows that, regardless of the matching algorithm used, the zoning law does 
not affect real estate market growth. Therefore, we  cannot associate the higher rental prices simply to a 
reduction in housing supply. There is a variety of mechanisms that can explain the causes of larger rental 
prices in regulated cities. For example, the need to comply with parameters and building codes can generate 
higher development costs (Quigley 2007), higher land prices (Kok, Monkkonen and Quigley 2014), or the 
land-use regulation can reduce housing supply elasticity, which favors large increases of prices in response 
to variations in demand. In addition, zoning can function as a kind of insurance against conflicting land 
uses,  thus  causing  an  appreciation  of  proprieties  (Zhou,  McMillen  and  McDonald  2008).  While 
understanding the mechanisms that underlie the relationship between zoning and higher prices is important, 
the aggregated nature of our database does not allow inferences in this way. 

Coming back to the ATT estimative on the average rental prices, how reliable are our estimates? 
The  answer  will  depend  on  how  the  estimated  ATTs  change  against  failures  in  Common  Independence 
Assumption (CIA). We believe that, even including important covariates to the propensity score estimation, 
there are unmeasurable variables that affect both the outcome variable and zoning adoption. For example, 
the degree of concern of municipal governments  with issues related to urban planning is not measurable 
and is a potential confounding factor that can invalidate the CIA. In the next subsection, we will conduct 
different kinds of sensitivity analysis. 
 
6.2 Sensitivity Analyses 
 

Firstly,  we  employ  the  Rosenbaum  (2002)  bounds  approach  to  measure  the  sensitivity  of  the 
baseline specification when our key assumption (CIA) is relaxed. Thus, we use different values of Γ  -which 
measures the difference in odds of receiving the treatment between observations with the same observable 
characteristics - to verify changes in inference due to the existence of unobservable confounders. Table 4 
shows the results for Γ ranging from 1 to 2 and the corresponding p-value bounds.  

It can be seen that up to Γ = 1.8, the estimated ATT remains statistically significant at the usual 
level of 5%. This indicates that a city may have a chance to adopt zoning 80% higher than the others due 
to unobservable characteristics and yet, our initial evidence remains reliable. Only when Γ = 1.9, the ATT 
is  no  longer  significant  at  the  usual  levels.  Thus,  for  the  higher  rental  prices  to  be  associated  with  a 
unobservable variable instead of zoning order, it is necessary that this confound increase by 90% the odds 

of  a  municipality  implement  the  zoning.  Consequently,  the  results  of  Table  3  cannot  be  explained  by  a 
simple moderate omitted-variable bias.

method is built based on the nearest neighbor matching without replacement. 
 

The results of the sensitivity analysis proposed by Inchino et al. (2008) can be seen in Table 5. We 
choose values of 𝑝𝑖𝑗 in order to simulate confounders with distributions analogous to those of the observed 
covariates  and  that  have  a  positive  correlation  with  treatment  and  outcome  variables7.  This  way,  we 
simulated  unobservables  with  a  similar  distribution  of  the  following  variables:  per  capita  income, 
population  density,  urbanization  rate,  average  schooling,  conservation  area  and  coastal  municipality 
dummy.  It is worth mentioning that the Inchino et al. (2008) procedure assumes that the distribution of 
simulated confounder is discrete8. Thus, to mimic the continuous covariates, we use the following criteria: 
the simulated binary variable will take the value of one if its value is above the mean (or median) of the 
distribution, and zero otherwise.

Note: The method is based on nearest neighbor matching with 200 interactions.  The outcome effect measures the impact of the unobserved 
variable on the untreated outcome, while the selection effect measures the impact of the unobserved variable on treatment assignment. *** p 
< 0.01, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.1. 
 

                                                             
7 This would be an unobserved variable with potential to explain the positive impact of zoning on rental prices. 
 
8 Through Monte Carlo simulations, the authors concluded that the assumption that the confounder assumes a discrete distribution when in fact 
it is continuous is not able to generate erroneous conclusions regarding the sensibility of the ATT. Moreover,  Wang & Krieger (2006) show 
that binary variables are more threatening to causal inference than continuous ones. 

From Table 5, it can  be seen that when the CIA does not hold due to the existence of a specific 
unobservable  confounder,  the  magnitude  of  the  ATT  changes  but  remains  qualitatively  important  and 
statistically significant. For example, even if we are omitting an unobservable that is too important to the 
adoption of zoning such as per capita income or population density (Alterman 2013, Gyourko, Saiz and 
Summers  2008),  our  initial  evidence  remains  valid.  These  results  reinforce  the  conclusion  reached  by 
applying the Rosenbaum bounds, indicating that, in fact, the positive impact of zoning on the average rental 
price does not seem to be driven by some omitted variable. 

 

6.3 Robustness Checks  
 

In  addition  to  the  sensitivity  analysis  described  in  the  previous  subsection,  we  also  verified  the 
robustness against changes in the definition of treatment and outcome variables. Firstly, it was considered 
a more specific measure of land-use restrictiveness: the minimum lot size. As discussed in Section 2, some 
municipalities determine a minimum lot size greater than the recommendation of Federal  Law 6799/79, 
becoming more rigid. Thus, we modify the treatment variable to a dummy that takes the value o 1 in case 
the municipality set a minimum lot size higher than 125m² and 0 otherwise. To get a clearer impact of this 
regulatory instrument, we dropped the municipalities that already have some zoning ordinance. Thus, the 
number of municipalities fell to 4,121, where 956 (23.19%) set a minimum lot size higher than 125m². The 
results of this exercise can be seen in panel A of Table 6.

Note: In panel A, the treatment variable is modified to a dummy that takes the value of 1 if the municipality adopts a minimum lot size (MLS) 
greater than 125 square meters and 0 otherwise. In panels B and C, the outcome variable is modified to the average/median rent prices without 
the hedonic correction. Analytical and bootstrap standard errors (200 interactions) are reported in round and square brackets, respectively. The 
Radius matching uses a 0.01 caliper and the Kernel matching is constructed using an Epanechnikov function. *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, *** p 
< 0.1. 
 

The estimated ATT indicates that in municipalities that adopt stricter criteria regarding the minimum 
lot size, the average rental prices are around 2.84% to 3.51% higher when compared to those who do not. 
This  result  is  in  line  with  our  previous  discussion  and  reveals  the  robustness  of  the  results  to  different 

treatment criteria. In panels B and C of Table 6, we change the outcome variable to the average and median9 
rental price without making any adjustments to the property characteristics. That is, the rental prices are not 
measured with constant quality. This robustness test is useful to demonstrate that the adjustment made in 
the  outcome  variable,  before  calculating  the  zoning  impact,  was  not  decisive  to  find  an  economically 
significantly result. In this case, the Figures of panels B and C indicate that there was a reduction in the 
magnitude  of  the  estimated  ATT.  However,  the  results  remain  economically  important,  indicating 
robustness. 

Finally, as argued in subsection 5.1, we chose to use the treatment assignment (zoning) based on the 
MUNIC  survey  of  2004.  Data  about  zoning  ordinances  were  also  collected in  MUNIC  1999,  2005  and 
2009.  However,  among  these  surveys,  there  are  some  divergences  regarding  the  information  about  the 
municipality  zoning  adoption.  The  2004  survey  has  a  higher  degree  of  compliance  with  local  laws, 
inspected manually. For this reason, this survey was chosen to define the municipalities that have zoning 
ordinances. Anyway, to demonstrate that our result was not driven by this choice, we also estimate the ATT 
modifying the treatment criterion to that one’s defined on MUNIC 1999, 2005 and 2009. The results are 
displayed in table 2A of Appendix (Panels A, B and C).  In panel D of Table 2A, the assignment is defined 
as follows: the municipality is treated (has zoning ordinances) if defined in at least one of MUNIC surveys. 
The result of table 3A shows that although there is a significant variation in the estimated ATTs, the results 
remain significant and economically relevant. That is, our conclusion is not sensitive to different MUNIC 
surveys. 
 
7. Conclusions 
 

In recent decades, due to the increased autonomy of local governments, the rising of income and a 
greater federal concern with urban planning issues, there has been, in Brazil, the diffusion of the idea of the 
urban land-use regulations. In this context, the number of cities with zoning law has grown from 64 in 1978 
to 1,724 in 2013. Nevertheless, little is known about the impact of these local policies on the functioning 
of the Brazilian real estate market. Our study sought to contribute to this debate. 

To reduce concerns about the endogeneity in the relationship between zoning and prices, we use a 
strategy  based  on  the  Propensity  Score  Matching  (PSM).  However,  a  necessary  assumption  is  that  the 
adoption of zoning is determined only by observable characteristics. This hypothesis, known as Conditional 
Independence Assumption (CIA), is little credible. Thus, through sensitivity analysis (Rosenbaum 2002, 
Inchino et al. 2008), we evaluate how our findings are robust to failures in the CIA. The results indicate 
that zoning generates an increase in the average rental price by 5.4% to 6.3%. Moreover, this evidence was 
robust to different matching algorithms, to the  fails in CIA and, also, to changes in the definition of the 
outcome and treatment variables. 

The fact that the cost of housing is higher in cities that restrict land use is consistent with previous 
studies  showing  that  regulations  favored  the  development  of  the  informal  housing  market  and  slum 
formation (Biderman, 2007, Cavalcanti and Da Matta 2013). Facing a higher price in the formal housing 
market, low-income households tend to migrate to the informal ones. Consequently, there is a welfare loss, 
since this type of market is characterized by poor urban infrastructures. In this way, zoning ordinances can 
be generating social costs that are not negligible. In terms of public policy, it is necessary that programs 
aimed  to  finance  affordable  housing  also  consider  the  degree  of  land  use  restrictiveness  in  the 
municipalities. Areas with more intense zoning may have  a wider coverage of these policies, in order to 
offset the adverse effects of land-use restrictions.
