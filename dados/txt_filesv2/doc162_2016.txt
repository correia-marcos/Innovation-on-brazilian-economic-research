Resumo 

Economias de aglomeração parecem ter um impacto significativo sobre mercados de trabalho locais. A interação 
de  firmas  e  trabalhadores  em  áreas  urbanas  densas  pode  gerar  vantagens  de  produtividade  que  resultam  em 
salários mais elevados. O tamanho da cidade tem um papel importante no poder de barganha de trabalhadores e 
firmas no mercado de trabalho relevante. Ao analisar a relação entre os salários locais e o ciclo de negócios – 
flexibilidade de salários, medida pela curva de salários –, esta influência parece ser maior no setor informal de 
áreas menos densas do Brasil. Assim, aglomerações maiores parecem proporcionar um poder de barganha maior 
para  os  trabalhadores,  já  que  nelas  eles  têm  acesso  a  mais  oportunidades  de  trabalho.  Adicionalmente,  o 
dualismo  no  mercado  de  trabalho  é  um  ingrediente  essencial  da  análise  da  curva  de  salários  em  países  em 
desenvolvimento.  Entretanto,  uma  análise  dual  do  mercado  de  trabalho  deve  ser  conduzida  no  nível  regional 
apropriado (mercados de trabalho locais), tornando possível encontrar impactos relevantes do tamanho da cidade 
no  poder  de  barganha  relativo  de  firmas  e  trabalhadores.  Nosso  estudo  busca  destacar  uma  nova  perspectiva 
teórica e empírica para a curva de salários, levando em conta as especificidades de países em desenvolvimento. 
A análise  aplicada  ao  Brasil mostra que  a flexibilidade de salários  é maior em áreas urbanas menos densas  e 
mais  elevada  no  setor  informal  quando  comparado  ao  formal.  Adicionalmente,  é  preciso  controlar  para 
características  locais  não  observadas  para  obter  a  ‘verdadeira’  elasticidade  de  salários  em  relação  às  taxas  de 
desemprego  locais,  e  efeitos  espaciais  devem  ser  considerado  quando  as  áreas  de  análise  são  suficientemente 
pequenas. Nesse caso, uma parte importante da diferença entre os setores formais e informais é originada pelos 
efeitos espaciais.

Abstract 

Agglomeration  economies  appear  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  local  labour  markets.  The  interaction  of 
workers and firms in dense urban areas may generate productivity advantages that result in higher wages. City 
size plays an important role in the relative bargaining power of workers and firms in the relevant labour market. 
When analysing the relationship between local wages and the business cycle – wage flexibility, measured by the 
wage curve –, this influence appears to be higher in informal sectors in less densely populated areas in Brazil. 
Therefore, large agglomerations are supposed to provide a higher bargaining power for workers, as they have 
more  job  opportunities.  In  addition,  labour  market  dualism  is  an  essential  ingredient  in  the  evaluation  of  the 
wage  curve  in  developing  economies.  However,  a  dual  labour  market  analysis  should  be  conducted  at  the 
appropriate regional level (labour market areas), making it possible to find a relevant impact of city size on the 
relative bargaining power of workers and firms. Our study aims to shed new theoretical and empirical light on 
the importance of the wage curve, taking into account various specificities of developing economies. The applied 
modelling  study  in  Brazil  shows  that  wage  flexibility  is  higher  in  less  dense  local  labour  markets  and  in  the 
informal  sector  in  relation  to  the  formal  sector.  Furthermore,  it  is  essential  to  control  for  unobserved  local 
characteristics in order to obtain the ‘true’ elasticity of wages to local unemployment rates, and spatial effects 
should be accounted for when the unit of analysis is rather small. In this sense, a significant part of the difference 
between the formal and the informal sectors originates from spatial effects.

1  Introduction 

The wage curve represents an empirical negative relation between wages and local unemployment rates at the 
regional level (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1994). This result is expected, as wage flexibility plays an important 
role  in  the  adjustment process of local  economies to adverse  shocks.  Moreover,  causality is  expected  to flow 
from unemployment size to the level of wages (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1995). Many empirical studies have 
corroborated  the  original  formulation  of  the  wage  curve  by  finding  negative  and  significant  relationships  in 
different socio-economic environments. Within the context of a developing country, with an abundant informal 
sector and a significant heterogeneity in terms of population density, the wage curve can be an expression of the 
degree of flexibility in the labour market. City size is one additional factor in this equation, as it increases the 
number of opportunities for a matching between firms and workers, and it can imply that firms and workers may 
have a more or less precautionary behaviour in their interactions in the labour market.  

Our  study  provides  a  comparison  of  the  formal  and  the  informal  sectors  in  Brazil,  and  how  the  intensity  of 
agglomeration factors affects them. Different aspects of the wage curve in Brazil are investigated, with various 
databases, regional aggregation levels, time periods, and data structures. Finally, an analytical framework based 
on different bargaining power levels for workers in the formal and the informal sector is developed, with a direct 
implication for the effect of urban size on the relative bargaining power of workers and firms. 

2  The wage curve  

An empirical relation between the level of wages and the unemployment rate in different regions is represented 
by the wage curve (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1995, 2005). A theoretical challenge associated with the wage 
curve is its robust pattern across countries and over time periods, despite the significant institutional differences 
among them. The wage curve can be interpreted as a measure of the flexibility of the labour market and several 
mechanisms  have  been  proposed  to  explain  it,  based  on  imperfect  competitive  structures:  bargaining  power, 
efficiency wage, labour contracts, and turnover costs. Some of these mechanisms have not necessarily become 
structured  theoretical  models,  and  most  importantly,  they  have  not  been  empirically  validated  (Nijkamp  and 
Poot,  2005).  An  exception  to  this  pattern  is  the  model  by  Campbell  and  Orszag  (1998)  based  on  the 
monopsonistic competition structure generated by turnover costs, further confirmed empirically by Morrison et 
al. (2006). Alternatively, Sato (2000) provided a simple search and matching framework combined with local 
productivity differentials. Their main conclusion was that regions with higher productivity would have higher 
wages  and  lower  unemployment  rates  in  equilibrium.  These  regions  also  present  a  higher  concentration  of 
people, and consequently, significant congestion costs that ensure the persistence of spatial inequalities. 

The wage curve is normally observed by comparing local labour markets. Spatial units and urban size can be 
related  in  two  ways:  neighbouring  areas  can  increase  accessibility  to  job  offers;  and  agglomeration  size  may 
increase local opportunities and influence the relationship of wages and the unemployment rate. Accessibility to 
jobs  can  affect  the  balance  of  the  bargaining  power  of  workers  and  employers  (Longhi  et  al.,  2006),  with  a 
positive  effect  on  the  local  wage  level.  In  addition,  the  unemployment  elasticity  to  pay  is  expected  to  be 
negatively  affected  by  a  higher  level  of  accessibility.  Then,  agglomeration  economies  may  increase  local 
productivity, leading to higher wages and lower unemployment rates (Sato, 2000), and they may be essential to 
determine the location of different local labour markets in the wage curve. Local labour markets can be subject 
to common shocks, with spatially autocorrelated  residuals, and spatial proximity can lead to a direct negative 
effect of unemployment in the neighbouring areas over local wages (Longhi et al., 2006). 

With these  considerations in mind, space  and  agglomeration  size  are  essential elements  in the  analysis  of  the 
wage curve. The effects of agglomeration are not restricted to the size of the labour market, but also to higher 
local  productivity.  Such  effects  can  be  heterogeneous  depending  on  the  degree  of  formalisation.  Therefore, 
formal and informal workers may have their bargaining power affected by local market size and higher local 
productivity to a different extent. This issue will be further explored in the following sections. 

3  Empirical literature 

The  empirical  literature  has  focused  on  the  analysis  of  this  relationship  by  comparing  countries  or  regions, 
controlling  for  individual  characteristics  and  other  relevant  microeconomic aspects.  Nijkamp  and Poot  (2005) 

3 

 
provided a meta-analysis of the coefficients estimated in more than 200 empirical wage curve studies, finding 
that there is a recurrent negative relationship between wages and the local unemployment rate. Correcting for 
publication and aggregation bias, this elasticity is estimated to be around -0.07. The most recent advances have 
made  a stronger  effort  to  control  for  worker heterogeneity  based on observed  and unobserved  characteristics, 
(Baltagi et al., 2009, 2012, for Germany, and Turunen,1998, for the United States).  

The inclusion of agglomeration effects and an explicit spatial dimension was based on recent advances in spatial 
econometrics techniques  (Baltagi  et  al., 2012;  Baltagi and Rokicki, 2014b;  Elhorst et  al., 2007;  Longhi et al., 
2006). Most studies have found that unemployment in surrounding areas also affects the equilibrium in the local 
labour  market,  as  workers  are  supposedly  aware  of  job  opportunities  in  these  areas.  In  the  absence  of  spatial 
spillovers, local unemployment elasticity is likely to be overestimated (Baltagi and Rokicki, 2014b). Longhi, et 
al. (2006) noted that the unemployment elasticity is lower in regions that interact more with others, meaning that 
more isolated areas have a less flexible labour market. Similar studies were conducted by Ramos et al. (2015) for 
Spain, Fingleton and Palombi (2013) in the UK, and Baltagi and Rokicki (2014b) for Poland, among others.  

In developing countries, usually a large share of the labour market is unregulated, based on informal relations 
and  does  not  follow  the  relevant  legislation  concerned.  This  has  important  implications  for  the  bargaining 
relationships  in  the  labour  market,  as  the  informal  sector  is  distinct  from  formal  jobs  and  unemployment. 
Economic shocks may be absorbed in this intermediate sector, with wages varying significantly given a change 
in the local unemployment rate. In Colombia, Ramos et al. (2010) found that the elasticity of individual wages to 
the  unemployment  rate  is  much  higher  in  the  case  of  informal  workers,  a  similar  result  as  the  one  found  by 
Baltagi  et  al.  (2013)  for  Turkey. When  controlling  for the potential  endogeneity  of unemployment  (FE-2SLS 
with the lagged value of the unemployment rate as an instrument), Baltagi et al. (2013) found a coefficient of -
0.071 for the formal sector and -0.263 for the informal sector (and -0.107 when both were considered together). 
Higher wage flexibility was also found for women, young individuals, with low tenure and low education. 

Labour  market  dualism  and  wage  differentials  between  workers  in  the  formal  and  informal  sectors  are  very 
relevant for the degree of wage flexibility in these sectors. However, Menezes-Filho et al. (2004) showed that 
when individual observed and unobserved characteristics are taken into account, most of the differences between 
wages  in  the  formal  and  the  informal  sectors  in  the  Brazilian  labour  market  vanish.  Therefore,  there  is  an 
indication of a self-selection process of more qualified workers in the formal sector, and any analysis trying to 
assess  labour  market  outcomes  from  the  perspective  of  sector  dualism  should  control  for  it.  With  data  from 
PME-IBGE (Monthly Employment Survey) on a more recent period (2003-2008), Corseuil and Foguel (2012) 
estimated  a  model  for  the  Brazilian  labour  market  with  a  similar  structure  as  a  wage  curve  (controlling  for 
individual  fixed  effects),  but  included  an  interaction  of  the  unemployment  rate  with  a  dummy  variable 
identifying whether the job is formal or informal. In an  economic  expansion, they find that the formality rate 
goes up and the wage gap between formal and informal workers increases. 

Wage curve estimation in Brazil has been focusing on the level of wage flexibility in the formal and the informal 
sectors, and between rural and urban areas. Barros and Mendonça (1997) applied this methodology to a pseudo-
panel combining gender, age groups, educational levels, and metropolitan regions with data from PME-IBGE, 
from 1982 to 1994. Their conclusion was that the degree of wage flexibility in Brazil was rather high during that 
period (a slope of -5), similar to the one observed in industrialised economies, but varied significantly over time 
(affected by the economic instability). They also found a lower wage flexibility for more qualified workers, a 
similar  result  as  the  one  obtained  by  Reis  (2006)  –  who  considered  state-level  data  from  1990  to  1999  from 
PNAD.  For  a  similar  period  (1989-1993),  with  data  from  PNAD,  but  evaluating  the  wage  curve  on 
macroeconomic terms (the ratio between the growth of real wages and the growth of the unemployment rate), 
Amadeo  and  Camargo  (1997)  found  a  slope  of  -10.  When  adding  informal  employment  variation  to 
unemployment variation, this slope fell to -4.5.  

Wage determination in Brazil has changed significantly over the past few decades. According to Carneiro and 
Henley  (1998),  at  the  beginning  of  the  1980s,  the  State  provided  a  centralised  wage  indexation,  weakening 
labour unions. Between the mid-1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, in spite of an increasing spur on the role 
of unions, extremely high inflation rates led the State to keep pursuing significant control over wage indexation. 
Finally, in the mid-1990s unions were able to bargain for higher real wages. Souza and Machado (2004) used 

4 

 
PNAD data from 1981 to 1999, following a two-stage estimation strategy (individual data in the first stage and 
macroregion-year  data in  the second).  Their  findings suggested that labour markets in urban  areas (-0.23)  are 
much more flexible than those in rural areas (-0.06). Silva and Monsueto (2012) considered a similar framework 
for the period 2002-2009, also with PNAD data. They found an elasticity of wages to unemployment of -0.0474, 
with  an  indication  that  low-education  segments  are  more  flexible.  Santolin  and  Antigo  (2009)  provided  an 
evaluation  of  a  dynamic  wage  curve  considering  averages  among  wage  groups,  gender,  race,  and  schooling 
years, in six metropolitan regions from 1997 to 2005 (with PNAD data). According to them, wage flexibility 
appeared to be higher for the whole group of workers (-0.15) than only for formal workers (-0.05). Furthermore, 
the coefficient of the lagged wage was close to zero, indicating that unemployment rates seem to be more related 
to the level of wages than to their change over time.  

A more recent piece of evidence on the wage curve relation in Brazil was presented by Baltagi et al. (2014a), 
analysing PNAD data from 2002 to 2009. Their estimations controlled for individual observed heterogeneity and 
state-level  fixed  effects,  instrumenting  the  unemployment  rate  by  its  lag.  When  the  formal  and  the  informal 
sectors were considered separately, only the latter presented significant results (-0.251, while the coefficient was 
-0.08 when both sectors were considered together). They also compared workers in the formal and the informal 
sectors  with  similar  probabilities  of  being  formal  (below  the  median),  and  the  elasticity  of  unemployment 
amounted to -0.129 and -0.305, respectively. Furthermore, they also found that men were more responsive to the 
unemployment rate (-0.13), while in the case of women the coefficient was not significant (women were more 
risk-averse, looking for more stable jobs). 

Summing up the results found in the literature, there is empirical evidence of the existence of a wage curve in 
Brazil, with different degrees of wage flexibility according to educational level, age, gender, size of the labour 
market and formalisation of the job. Furthermore, over time wage flexibility has decreased, accompanied by an 
increase in  economic  predictability  and  macroeconomic stability  of the  country,  a  formalisation  of the labour 
market  and  an  increase  of  the  educational  level  of  the  labour  force.  Clearly,  there  is  room  to  explore  further 
aspects  of  the  wage  curve,  in  particular,  spatial  dependence  and  agglomeration  economies,  the  control  of 
individual unobserved heterogeneity, and for a possible selection bias of the participation in the labour market.  

4  Labour market dualism in Brazil 

There are pronounced differences in the way individuals interact in the labour market of developing economies 
according to sector, location, firm size, educational level, and other characteristics. In this context, the literature 
on  wage  dualism  has  investigated  whether  similar  workers  in  different  sectors  (formal  and  informal)  receive 
different  payments  (Soares,  2004).  Labour  market  segmentation  can  be  generated  by  different  mechanisms, 
amongst  others:  i)  firms’  heterogeneity  (technology,  market  power,  size,  sector),  and  ii)  institutional  aspects 
(unions and/or labour legislation). The latter may lead to segmentation if it imposes effective restrictions on the 
labour market and if there is an inefficient structure of enforcement to follow these rules, applied only to a share 
of the agents (Pero, 1992; Ulyssea, 2006). The model discussed in the following section aims to represent the 
main  differences  between  the  formal  and  the  informal  sectors  in  local  labour  markets  that  generate  the  wage 
curve under potential labour market dualism. It allows for distinct flexibility degrees observed in different sectors 
in a dual economy of a developing country. This is achieved by combining turnover costs in an efficiency wage 
model  and  a  varying  bargaining  degree.  These  two  mechanisms  have  an  impact  in  the  observed  relationship 
between wages, productivity and unemployment (Booth, 2014). 

4.1 Theoretical framework: institutional costs, bargaining power and efficiency wages 

Firms in the formal sector may be subject to “labour codes” that regulate hiring and firing, and impose higher 
costs to them in terms of higher taxes and benefits that must be payed to workers (Fields, 2005). Under these 
conditions,  wages  may  not  adjust  completely  to  the  business  cycle.  The  main  characteristics  of  dual  labour 
markets indicate that bargaining power can vary significantly between these sectors. This may be generated by a 
higher presence of unions in the formal sector, as well as higher turnover costs that can be found in this sector. 
There is also the risk of a shortage of high-skilled workers necessary for specific tasks in the formal jobs sector, 
which  decrease the propensity  of dismissal  by  firms in this sector.  Therefore, one possible way  of modelling 

 
these differences is to consider that workers in the informal sector have less bargaining power than workers in 
the formal sector (Blien et al., 2013, them as keys to explain the wage curve). 

In our study, the model developed by Barth et al. (2002) is adapted for the context of a developing country with a 
formal and an informal sector. This model combines two mechanisms that generate the relationship of the wage 
curve:  efficiency  wage  and  wage  bargaining.  The  efficiency  wage  model  encompasses  endogenous  turnover 
costs (Campbell and Orszag, 1998), depicted in (1), which are dependent on the probability that the worker quits 
(negatively related to the unemployment rate). Under higher unemployment rates, turnover costs are supposed to 
be  lower.  Replacement  costs  per  worker  (𝐶)  are  given  by  the  multiplication  of  hiring  costs  (𝐻)  and  the 
probability that the worker quits (𝑞): 

5 

𝐶𝑟 = 𝐻𝑟𝑞𝑟 

(1) 

Extending the model proposed by Barth et al. (2002) from a single point economy to a spatial setting, migration 
is possible and quitting is affected by wages in other local labour markets (MORRISON; PAPPS; POOT, 2006). 
The elasticity of quits to the expected relative pay is – 𝜂 in the local labour market and −𝜇 in neighbouring areas. 
Wages  and  the  unemployment  rate  of  other  local  labour  markets  can  be  approximated  by  the  economy-wide 
values,  and they  are  weighted  by  an average migration cost  between  region 𝑟 and  other  regions  𝑟′, 𝛾(𝑐𝑟′𝑟)), 
where 𝛾′ < 0 and 𝛾′′ > 0. 

𝑞𝑟 = (

(1 − 𝑢𝑟)𝑤̅𝑟

−𝜂
)

𝑤𝑟

(
𝛾(𝑐𝑟′𝑟)(1 − 𝑢𝑟′)𝑤̅𝑟′

)

 

(2) 

Firm’s profits are given by 𝜋𝑟 = 𝑅𝑟(𝐿𝑟) − 𝐶𝑟𝐿𝑟 − 𝑤𝑟𝐿𝑟. In this equation, 𝑅𝑟(𝐿𝑟) is the revenue received by 
firms, and 𝐶𝑟 is the replacement cost defined in (1). Workers can go on a strike in a bargaining process. In this 
case, firms receive 0 payoff, while workers may receive a fraction 𝜑 ∈ [0,1] of the expected local alternative 
wage  or  a  fraction  of  the  alternative  wage  in  neighbouring  areas  (𝜃 ∈ [0,1]),  with  𝜃 + 𝜑 < 1.  Then,  the 
equilibrium is achieved through a Nash bargaining framework, which involves the optimisation of the weighted 
combination of gains of workers and firms: 

max 𝑁 = max(𝑤𝑟 − 𝜑(1 − 𝑢𝑟)𝑤̅𝑟 − 𝜃𝛾(𝑐𝑟′𝑟)(1 − 𝑢𝑟′)𝑤̅𝑟′)𝛽𝑟 𝜋𝑟

1−𝛽𝑟 

(3) 

In this setting, 𝛽 is the bargaining power of workers. In equilibrium, 𝑤𝑟 = 𝑤̅𝑟 = 𝑤̅𝑟′, and all firms are assumed 
to be identical. Then, following Manning (2011), the equilibrium wage will be given by: 

𝑤𝑟 = 𝑏𝑟 (

𝑅𝑟
𝐿𝑟

− 𝐶𝑟) + (1 − 𝑏𝑟)(𝜂 + 𝜇)𝐶𝑟 , 

where: 

0 ≤ 𝑏𝑟 =

 
1 − (1 − 𝛽𝑟)(𝜑(1 − 𝑢𝑟) + 𝜃𝛾(𝑐𝑟′𝑟)(1 − 𝑢𝑟′))

𝛽𝑟

(4) 

(5) 

When 𝛽 = 0, the model becomes solely based on the efficiency wage mechanism, with 𝑤𝑟
in this case the elasticity of wages to the unemployment rate is given by: 

∗ = (𝜂 + 𝜇)𝐶𝑟, and 

∗ =

𝜆𝑟

∗

𝜕𝑤𝑟
𝜕𝑢𝑟

𝑢𝑟
𝑤𝑟

∗ = −𝜂

(6) 

On the other hand, if 𝜂 = 𝜇 = 0 and turnover costs are taken as exogenous, 𝑤𝑟
of wage to unemployment will be: 

𝐵 = 𝑏𝑟 (

𝑅𝑟
𝐿𝑟

− 𝐻𝑟), the elasticity 

𝐵 =

(7) 

However,  the  combination  of  efficiency  wage  and  wage  bargaining  mechanisms  generate  a  rent  effect  of  the 
unemployment rate on bargained wages, whose elasticity is given by:

According to  Barth  et  al.  (2002),  this  result  can  be  interpreted in the  following way.  Under  a pure  efficiency 
wage  setting,  the  introduction  of  a  bargaining  mechanism  may  lead  to  a  higher  sensitivity  in  relation  to 
unemployment, if the efficiency wage effect is small and 𝜑 is high. However, as 𝛽𝑟 increases, the alternative 
wage effect embedded in the turnover costs term diminishes, and the rent-sharing goes up, leading 𝜆𝑟, which is 
negative,  to  values  closer  to  zero.  Then,  if  two  different  groups  of  workers  with  distinct  levels  of  bargaining 
power  are  compared,  those  with  a  higher  level  of  𝛽𝑟  will  face  less  wage  flexibility  in  the  labour  market.  In 
addition,  the  unemployment  rate  in  neighbouring  areas  is  inversely  related  to  turnover  costs.  This  term  is 
included in the rent effect, and a higher 𝑢𝑟′ will decrease wage flexibility to the local unemployment rate. On the 
other hand, the larger the commuting distance to other regions, the lower the turnover costs, indicating that the 
unemployment elasticity of pay will be greater in regions that are more isolated (Longhi et al., 2006). 

Agglomeration  economies  are  also  relevant  in  the  context  of  the  wage  curve,  as  they  are  related  to  higher 
productivity and higher wages, accompanied by lower unemployment rates (Sato, 2000). This is an additional 
mechanism to generate the wage curve. Therefore, regions with higher urban concentration are expected to be in 
the left-upper side of the wage curve, while less-agglomerated areas are on the lower-right side. On the other 
hand,  the  efficiency  wage  model  presupposes  that  regional  amenities  generate  spatial  differences  in  the 
equilibrium  of  wages  and  unemployment  (Card,  1995;  Elhorst  et  al.,  2007).  Then,  high-amenity  regions  are 
supposed  to  present  lower  wages  and  higher  unemployment  rates,  while  low-amenity  regions  will  be  in  the 
opposite location of the wage curve (high wages, low unemployment). This issue requires further investigation, 
but the agglomeration degree is an essential element to generate the wage curve. 

5  Empirical research strategy 

5.1 Model development 

The model discussed in the previous section indicates that there is a negative relationship between wages and the 
local level of the unemployment rate. A reduced form of this model can be represented by: 

𝑤𝑟,𝑡 = 𝛾1𝑢𝑟,𝑡 + ∑ 𝑋𝑟,𝑡,𝑘𝛽𝑘

+ 𝜃𝑟 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜖𝑟,𝑡,

𝑟 = {1, … , 𝑅}, 𝑡 = {1, … , 𝑇} 

(11) 

𝑘

However, as discussed in Section 3, the empirical literature has started to control for individual heterogeneity in 
order to obtain a coefficient that actually captures this relationship. Therefore, individual wages at the individual 
level  are  related  to  the  unemployment  rate  at  the  local  level,  controlling  for  observed  and  unobserved 
characteristics at both levels whenever possible.  

𝑤𝑖,𝑟,𝑡 = 𝛾1𝑢𝑟,𝑡 + ∑ 𝑋𝑖,𝑟,𝑡,𝑘𝛽𝑘

+ 𝜃𝑟 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑟,𝑡,

𝑘

𝑖 = {1, … , 𝑁}, 𝑟 = {1, … , 𝑅}, 𝑡 = {1, … , 𝑇} 

(12) 

7 

 
In this initial formulation, 𝑤𝑖,𝑟,𝑡 is the logarithm of the individual hourly wage and 𝑢𝑟,𝑡 is the logarithm of the 
unemployment  rate  in  region  𝑟.  Moreover,  𝜃𝑟  is  the  region  effect,  𝛿𝑡  is  a  time  effect  and  𝑋𝑖,𝑟,𝑡  is  a  set  of 
observed  characteristics  of  individual  𝑖  (age,  age2,  education,  sector,  occupation,  etc.).  Whenever  there  is 
longitudinal data available at the individual level, an additional term 𝛼𝑖 representing the individual fixed effect 
can be included to control for unobserved individual characteristics fixed in time. The parameter of interest in the 
equation  above  will  be  𝛾1,  representing  the  elasticity  of  wages  against  the  level  of  the  unemployment  rate. 
According to the main elements of the theoretical framework discussed before, these models will be estimated 
for different population groups. Namely, whenever possible, the estimation of the wage curve will be conducted 
for the formal and informal sectors separately and for different degrees of urban agglomeration. Furthermore, 
following the argument of Meghir and Whitehouse (1996), the analysis is restricted only to men, as they will 
most  likely  stay  in  the  labour  market  even  when  facing  adverse  conditions  (low  wages,  high  unemployment, 
inadequate work conditions). 

5.2 Extensions of the analytical framework 

5.2.1 Multi-level analysis 

The wage curve with controls for individual heterogeneity is characterised by variables in different aggregation 
levels.  If  this  multilevel  nature  of  the  data  is  not  taken  into  account,  there  may  be  a  miscalculation  of  the 
significance  of  the  effect  of  aggregated  variables  over  micro-units.  Considering  the  discussion  developed  by 
Moulton (1990), individuals in the same labour market may share some components of the variance that are not 
entirely  explained  by  their  observed  characteristics,  unobserved  heterogeneity  (constant  in  time)  or  by  more 
aggregated  variables,  such  as  the  unemployment  rate  (at  the  area  level).  In  this  case,  the  error  term  in  the 
equation associated with individual wages, 𝑋𝑖𝑟𝑡 and 𝑢𝑟𝑡 will be positively correlated across individuals in the 
same  local  market  and  as  a  consequence  the  standard  error  of  the  unemployment  effect  will  be  downwardly 
biased, generating higher t-statistics (Card, 1995). 

A solution proposed in some studies involves calculating averaged values of all individual-level variables at the 
area  level.  Then,  the  wage  curve  would  be  estimated  directly  at  this  aggregated  level  (Baltagi  et  al.,  2000; 
Blanchflower and Oswald, 1994; Santolin and Antigo, 2009). Another possibility is to estimate the wage curve 
in two stages (Bell et al., 2002). In the first stage, the logarithms of individual hourly wages are regressed against 
individual  characteristics  and  a  region-year  dummy,  which  will  synthetize  the  regional  characteristics  that 
explain wage differences over time. This first stage can be estimated either with repeated cross-sections or with a 
panel of individuals (with the control of the unobserved individual heterogeneity constant in time).  

𝑤𝑖,𝑟,𝑡 = 𝜆𝑟,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑡 + ∑ 𝑋𝑖,𝑟,𝑡,𝑘𝛽𝑘

+ 𝜂𝑖,𝑟,𝑡 

(13) 

𝑘

Then, the estimated region-year dummy 𝜆̂
explained by regional characteristics, including the unemployment rate. 

𝑟,𝑡 is used in the second stage as a dependent variable, which will be 

𝜆̂

𝑟,𝑡 = 𝜇𝑟 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝛾2𝑢𝑟,𝑡 + 𝜈𝑟,𝑡 

(14) 

The parameter of interest will be 𝛾2, while 𝜇𝑟 and 𝛿𝑡 are region fixed effects and time dummies.  

5.2.2 Endogeneity of the unemployment rate 

One of the main concerns of the empirical literature examining the wage curve regards the potential endogeneity 
of  the  unemployment  rate  due  to  simultaneity.  The  most  common  strategy  is  to  consider  time  lags  of  this 
variable as instruments, with the underlying hypothesis that wages in the present do not affect the unemployment 
rate in the past nor do they share a common causing factor. 

5.2.3 Selection bias 

Most  labour  market  analyses  may  be  subject  to  the  problem  of  selection  bias,  especially  when  the  idea  is  to 
obtain estimates that are representative for the whole population and not only for a specific group with available 
information.  In  the  case  of  the  wage  curve,  the  equation  is  supposed  to  represent  the  whole  population  of  a 
working  age,  while  data  is  observed  only  for  employed  individuals  (a  case  of  incidental  truncation  – 

 
Wooldridge,  2002,  p.  560).  Within  this  context,  the  sample  of  employed  individuals  for  whom  wages  are 
observed may not be randomly selected from the whole population. Card (1995) pointed out that Blanchflower 
and  Oswald  (1994)  failed  to  discuss  any  potential  effect  of  selection  bias  in  the  case  of  the  wage  curve,  but 
composition  bias  can  affect  the  elasticity  of  wages  with  respect  to  local  unemployment  rates.  The  selection 
model developed by Heckman (1979) aims to deal with this issue. It is possible to revise (12), rewriting it in a 
simplified version: 

8 

𝑤 = 𝛾1𝑢 + 𝑋𝛽 + 𝜀 

(15) 

But the wage is observed only if the person works (𝐿 = 1). The estimation of the parameters of interest must 
take into  account  this  additional information in  order to  correct  the limiting  distribution  of  the  estimator. The 
probability of being an employee is given by: 

𝐿 = 1[𝑍𝛿 + 𝜉 > 0] 

(16) 

in which 𝐿 represents the condition of being an employee, while 𝑍 is a vector of variables associated with this 
probability. The main assumptions underlying this method are the following: (i) 𝐿 and 𝑍 are always observed for 
all  individuals;  (ii)  (𝜀, 𝜉)  is  independent  of  𝑍  with  0  mean;  (iii)  𝜉~𝑁(0,1);  (iv)  𝐸(𝜀|𝜉) = 𝜃𝜉  (linear 
relationship  between  the  error  terms).  Then,  the  estimating  equation  can  be  derived  by  considering  that  the 
element to  be  estimated is  actually  𝐸(𝑤|𝑢, 𝑋, 𝐿 = 1). Combining  the  assumptions  above  with  this  statement 
generates the final model: 

𝐸(𝑤|𝑢, 𝑋, 𝐿 = 1) = 𝛾1𝑢 + 𝑋𝛽 + 𝜁𝜆(𝑍𝛿) 

(17) 

where 𝜆(∙) ≡

𝜙(∙)

Φ(∙)⁄

 is the inverse Mills ratio, which represents 𝐸(𝐿 = 1|𝑍) = 𝐸(𝜉|𝜉 > −𝑍𝛿) = 𝜆(𝑍𝛿). 

A consistent estimator of 𝛿 is obtained with a first-stage probit estimation of the selection equation for the whole 
population. After that, it is possible to consistently estimate 𝛾1 and 𝛽 by regressing 𝑤 against 𝑢, 𝑋 and 𝜆(𝑍𝛿̂) 
using the selected sample. 

5.2.4 Spatial dependence and neighbouring effects 

The  unemployment  rate  in  neighbouring  areas  could  affect  wages  directly  (with  a  negative  relationship)  or 
indirectly, by increasing local wage flexibility. In the literature, such effect was estimated including the spatial 
lag of the unemployment rate (Longhi et al., 2006) or spatial autocorrelation in the error and in the dependent 
variable (Baltagi et al., 2012; Fingleton and Palombi, 2013; Ramos et al., 2015; Elhorst et al., 2007; Buettner, 
1999). Departing from (14), at the region level, the error term can present spatial autocorrelation, which is tested 
using LM test statistics discussed by Elhorst (2014). Then, according to these tests results, two main options are 
available to account for spatial dependence. The spatial lag model can be specified as: 

𝜆̂

𝑟,𝑡 = 𝜇𝑟 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜌𝑊𝜆̂

𝑟,𝑡 + 𝛾2𝑢𝑟,𝑡 + 𝜈𝑟,𝑡 , 

while the spatial error model is written as: 

𝜆̂

𝑟,𝑡 = 𝜇𝑟 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝛾2𝑢𝑟,𝑡 + 𝜖𝑟,𝑡 

𝜖𝑟,𝑡 = 𝜑𝑊𝜖𝑟,𝑡 + 𝜈𝑟,𝑡 

(18) 

(19) 

(20) 

where 𝑊 is the spatial weights matrix based on inverse distances and common local labour market areas (see 
Subsection 6.4.1 for further details), constant in time. The error terms 𝜈𝑟,𝑡 are supposed to be independently and 
identically distributed for all 𝑟, with zero mean and variance 𝜎2.1 

5.2.5 Dynamic wage curve 

Another  possible  extension  to  the  basic  wage  curve  model  consists  of  including  time-lagged  wages  in  the 
original regression, obtaining a dynamic wage curve (Baltagi et al., 2009, 2012). The Phillips curve can be an 
alternative  explanation  to  the  relationship  between  wages  and  the  unemployment  rate  (Blanchard  and  Katz,

these  models 

 
1997). In the literature, the estimation of a dynamic wage setting equation aims to test which relationship is more 
prone to be happening in a certain country. For instance, considering data aggregated at the regional level over 
time, the wage curve to be estimated can be the following (Bell et al., 2002): 

𝑤𝑟,𝑡 = 𝑎𝑟 + (1 − 𝜆)𝑤𝑟,𝑡−1 + 𝛽𝑢𝑟,𝑡 + 𝑑𝑡 + 𝜀𝑟,𝑡 

(21) 

In  this  case,  there  are  three  possible  outcomes:  if  (1 − 𝜆) = 0,  then  𝜆 = 1,  and  the  wage  curve  explanation 
dominates; if (1 − 𝜆) = 1, 𝜆 = 0, and the Phillips curve seems to be more adequate; if 0 < 𝜆 < 1, there is a 
dynamic wage curve: the impact of past regional changes is prolonged over more than one time period, and the

6  Empirical analysis 

6.1 Introduction 

The empirical analysis of the wage curve in Brazil is clearly limited by data availability. Differently from other 
case  studies  mentioned  in  Section  3,  in  Brazil  there  is  still  no  longitudinal  database  with  national  coverage 
applied over a long period comparing the formal and the informal sectors.  

6.2 Wage curve in a more aggregated context: a comparison between the formal and the informal sectors 

Here  we  aim  to  measure  wage  flexibility  in  a  more  aggregated  context,  with  monthly  data,  controlling  for 
individual heterogeneity.  

6.2.1 Description of the database – Monthly Employment Survey 

This survey is conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), and here we consider 
data  from  March  2003  to  June  2015.  The  moving  panel  available  in  the  database  is  analysed  based  on  the 
methodology provided by Ribas and Soares (2010)2. A few steps were conducted to obtain the final database. 
Only male individuals aged 15 to 59 years old, working as employees in the formal or the informal sector were 
kept.  Formality  status  was  defined  by  the  existence  or  not  of  a  contract  under  the  CLT  regulation,  and 
individuals with wages equal to zero or with missing information, or with less than 20 or more than 60 working 
hours  per  week  were  excluded.  Only  individuals  observed  in  the  second  and  in  the  sixth  interviews  (twelve 
months  apart  from  each  other)  were  selected.  The  final  database  comprised  193,934  observations  (96,967 
surveyed individuals, observed in two moments in time, representing more than 49 million individuals over the 
period of more than 12 years when the sampling scheme was taken into account). The aggregate unemployment 
rate  was  calculated  for  each  metropolitan  region  for  each  month.  In  addition,  wages  were  deflated  by  local 
inflation indexes (National Consumer Price Index – INPC – in each metropolitan region. 

6.2.2 Descriptive statistics 

The average unemployment rate for the six metropolitan regions surveyed by PME decreased steadily from 2003 
to 2014 and increased in the last few months of the period analysed. On the other hand, wages for the formal and 
the informal sector presented an upward trend in the period, with the important remark that the formal sector 
paid higher salaries on average than the informal sector.  This general trend for wages and unemployment can 
also be  found when  each  metropolitan  region is analysed separately.  However, the timing  of adjustment may 
vary between them. Furthermore, in 2015 wages were higher in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Porto Alegre and 
Belo  Horizonte,  while  higher  unemployment  rates  could  be  found  in  Salvador,  Recife  and  São  Paulo. 
Considering the composition of the database over time3, it is possible to note an increase in the average age from 
2003 to 2015. São Paulo gained importance in the database, as well as higher education levels (especially 11 
years  of  schooling  or  more,  which  passed  from  45.0%  to  67.2%  of  the  population  in  the  period).  More 
importantly, the share of workers in the formal sector4 rose from 84.1% to 93.7%. Jobs in the industrial sector 
lost importance, while the share of workers in the construction and the financial sectors increased over time.

6.2.3 Results and preliminary conclusions 

The  first  set  of  results  attempted  to  control  for  the  issues  discussed  in  Subsections  5.2.2  and  5.2.5  (namely, 
endogeneity of the unemployment rate and the estimation of a dynamic wage curve). This was possible because 
of the longitudinal nature of the database, with high-frequency information. Other issues such as the selection 
bias were not treated here because PME focuses mostly on labour market outcomes, and does not detail other 
dimensions of the individual’s life. In the case of the models with individual fixed effects (two time-periods for 
each individual separated by one year), controls that did not vary over time for the same individual at least over a 
year were dropped (education level, age, month, among others). 

The  results  presented in  Table  1 indicated that  for the basic model  (OLS  estimation),  a wage  curve  could be 
observed only for the informal sector, while the coefficient for the formal sector was not significant. When these 
two sectors  were  aggregated, once  again it  was not  possible to obtain a  significant effect. However, Model 1 
controlled only for observed individual characteristics. When individual fixed effects were included (Model 2), 
all effects disappeared. Model 3 considered the same estimation as Model 1, but now unemployment rates were 
instrumented by their time lag. Then, once again, there was an indication of a wage curve relationship only for 
the informal sector. In Model 4, individual fixed effects were added to the regression, and this generated non-
significant coefficients. All these results indicated that the wage curve could be observed only in the case of the 
informal sector in  Brazil,  but this  result  may  be  generated  by  the  fact that observed individual  characteristics 
were not enough to control for all relevant variability.

Models  5  to  8  allowed  for  the  possibility  of  the  existence  of  a  dynamic  wage  curve.  When  individual  fixed 
effects were included (Models 6 and 8), it was not possible to find any significant results. On the other hand, 
when  only  the  cross-sectional  dimension  was  taken  into  account  (Models  5  and  7),  including  the  time  lag  of 
wages generated coefficients that were half of the size of Models 1 and 3 (in absolute terms) for the informal 
sector, while there was no significant relationship for the formal sector. The estimation of dynamic models also 
allowed for testing whether the relationship between wages and the unemployment rate could be better explained 
by  a  Phillips  curve.  Following  the  strategy  mentioned  in  Subsection  5.2.5,  the  results  presented  in  Table  2 
indicated that when only observed characteristics of the individuals were taken into account, the coefficient of 
the  lagged  wage  was  close  to  one  (meaning  that  the  Phillips  curve  could  be  a  better  analytical  framework). 
However, the inclusion of individual fixed effects led to a division by half of these coefficients, signalling that a 
dynamic wage curve was the more appropriate explanation. The complete regression results can be requested to 
the authors.

One interesting extension for the models presented in Table 1 is to check how estimations may vary over time. 
Figure 1 shows the evolution of the coefficients for the formal and the informal sectors (and their confidence 
intervals) based on the estimation of Model 1. Each observation on the x-axis was obtained by estimating the 
model for the previous twelve months (moving sample). The confidence intervals showed that elasticities were 
significantly  different  from  zero  only  in  specific  moments  for  the  informal  sector.  In  the  case  of  the  formal 
sector, the coefficient was not different from zero in a consistent way. These results indicated that even when a 
wage curve was found in aggregated terms, it will not necessarily be constant over time.

periods ending in each month.

The  coefficients  for  the  informal  sector  seem  to  match  the  main  results  found  in  the  literature  for  developed 
economies. However, metropolitan regions in a developing country such as Brazil do not necessarily represent 
the whole country – in general, they are much more diversified than other less dense areas, with better jobs and a 
labour market with particular characteristics. All models including individual fixed effects will compare them in 
only two points in time, reducing within variation, which may explain why no effect was found in these models. 
These individuals were observed more than once in the database only if they stayed in the same metropolitan 
region.  Finally,  unemployment  rates  were  observed  only  for  six  regions,  meaning  that  this  variable  does  not 
present very much variation between individuals.  

6.3 The rural-urban dichotomy and the wage curve 

The second set of results discussed here involve the estimation of the wage curve with repeated cross-sections 
that allow for the control of individual observed characteristics and state-level data.  

6.3.1 Description of the database – National Household Sample Survey 

PNAD  data  was  analysed  for  the  period  from  1996  to  2013,  after  the  macroeconomic  normalisation  and  the 
implementation  of the Real  as  the  currency  of the  country.  The  survey  was  not  conducted in  2000  and 2010 
(Census years). However, the fact that the time lag of the unemployment rate was considered as an instrumental 
variable requires the calculation of this rate for these missing years. This was done by obtaining the average of

the rates observed in the previous and posterior years. Due to this restriction, two different  periods of analysis 
were  compared,  1996  to  2013  and  2002  to  2009.  Furthermore,  rural  areas  of  the  states  of  Rondônia,  Acre, 
Amazonas, Roraima, Pará and Amapá were excluded from the analysis, as they were not surveyed before 2004.  

Only male individuals aged 15 to 59 years old were kept in the database. The population of interest comprised 
employees  with  positive  wages  working  in  the  private  sector  with  or  without  a  contract  under  the  CLT 
regulation. The unemployment rate was calculated for each state considering all economically active individuals 
(unemployed  and  employed),  and  wages  were  deflated  by  the  average  inflation  index  of  the  whole  country 
(National Consumer Price Index – Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor – INPC). It was not possible to 
correct wages for local components of this index because they were available only for some states. 

12 

6.3.2 Descriptive statistics 

The analysis must consider not only the characteristics of individuals in the formal and the informal sectors, but 
also  how  they  compare  with  individuals  outside  of  these  groups  (workers  in  other  occupations  –  domestic 
workers, self-employed, public employees, employers – unemployed individuals, people out of the labour force). 
The reason to follow this procedure is that these other groups were part of the comparison group in the Heckman 
selection model. Regarding the descriptive statistics of the database5, the first aspect to be highlighted is the fact 
that the formal sector presented a much higher wage than the informal sector. For the labour force ex-formal and 
informal,  this  average  was  calculated  only  for  those  who  work.  The  average  age  in  the  informal  sector  was 
lower, as well as their tenure at the same company. In the formal sector it was possible to observe higher values 
of per capital income ex-wages, meaning that these families had a more stable financial condition. In terms of 
their regional distribution, workers in the informal sector were relatively more concentrated in the Northeast and 
in the North, while workers in the formal sector were more present in the Southeast and the South. 

The education level of workers in the formal sector was higher (2013, 9% of them had 15 years of schooling or 
more, while only 3.8% of workers in the informal sector had achieved that level). It is noteworthy that between 
1996  and  2013,  real  wages  and  the  educational  level  of  the  population  increased  significantly,  while  the 
participation  of  informal  workers  in  the  labour  force  went  down.  Informal  jobs  were  relatively  more 
concentrated in agriculture, construction and services in 2013. At the same time, the formal sector was relatively 
more present in manufacture, transport and communication, and commerce. A similar pattern was observed for 
occupational  groups: those requiring  administrative, technical, artistic, scientific  and transportation skills were 
relatively  more  frequent  in  the  formal  sector.  In  the  informal  sector,  agriculture,  livestock  and  extractive 
occupations showed a much higher participation in 2013.

Finally, salaries and the unemployment rate should be compared in each state over time. It is possible to note 
from Figure 2 that in 1996 the aggregated relationship between wages and the local unemployment rate for the 
formal and the informal sectors seemed to have a positive sign, while in 2013 their correlation seemed negative 
(more negative for the informal sector). In fact, Morrison and Poot (1998) identified that aggregated data may

not  provide  any  convincing  evidence  of  the  wage  curve.  However,  when  individual  and  local  characteristics 
were  controlled  for,  this  pattern  may  change.  The  next  subsection  will  discuss  how  wage  flexibility  varies 
according to the sector and the local characteristics of the labour market.

6.3.3 Results 

The first set of results of the wage curve estimated with PNAD data was based on (12), (one-stage regression), 
with individual and regional-level data. This strategy was adopted here due to the limited number of regions (27 
states),  which  could  limit  large-sample  assumptions  for  a  possible  two-stage  estimation  as  proposed  in 
Subsection 5.2.1. Furthermore, as discussed in Subsection 6.3.1, two different time periods were analysed (1996 
to 2013 and 2002 to 2009), to assess the possible varying effects over time, as well as how the results may be

In  Table  3,  the  first  three  columns  present  the  results  for  pooled  cross-sections  OLS  estimates  of  individual 
wages  for  the  period  from  1996  to  2013,  controlling  for  state  fixed  effects.  For  the  whole  country  (rural  and 
urban),  all  coefficients  were  positive,  with  a  lower  value  for  the  informal  sector  (Models  1a,  2a  and  3a). 
However, then the model was estimated specifically for rural areas (Models 1b, 2b and 3b), only the elasticity of 
unemployment of the informal sector was significant, and with the expected negative sign. On the other side, for 
urban areas (Models 1c, 2c and 3c), all elasticities were positive and significant.

Finally,  the last three  columns in the  right  hand  side  considered  an  IV  estimation,  with a one-year lag  of the 
unemployment rate as an instrument for the actual unemployment rate in each state. Now, the coefficient for the 
unemployment  rate  over  wages  in  the  informal  sector  in  the  whole  country  was  no  longer  significant,  even 
though  the  coefficients  for  the  formal  sector  and  the  whole  economy  were  positive  (and  larger  than  the  ones 
observed  in  the  OLS  estimations).  When  only  individuals  living  in  rural  areas  were  taken  into  account,  the 
elasticity  of  the  unemployment  rate  with  both  sectors  analysed  simultaneously  was  negative  and  slightly 
significant,  while  the  elasticity  of  the  unemployment  rate  for  wages  in  the  informal  sector  increased  in 
comparison to the OLS estimation and reached -0.134. Finally, the IV estimation for the urban sector indicated 
that the elasticity for the informal sector was not significant, while it was positive and significant for the formal 
sector  and  for  the  whole  urban  labour  market.  For  all  models,  the  F  statistic  indicated  that  the  lag  of  the 
unemployment rate was a relevant instrument for the unemployment rate in 𝑡. 

When the period of analysis was restricted to 2002 to 2009, there seemed to be more indication of the presence 
of  a  wage curve in the  relationships  of the labour  market.  In  general,  elasticities were  lower or  even  became 
negative, a sign that the wage curve seemed to better express this specific period. This regression covered the

same period studied by Baltagi, Rokicki and Souza (2014a). Even though their results seemed to better confirm 
the expected shape of the wage  curve, the  main  conclusions  were  very similar to  the ones  found here. Wage 
flexibility seemed to be higher in rural areas and in the informal sector. This result was in accordance with the 
model discussed in Section 4 and added some conclusions to the conclusions obtained in Subsection 6.2.

The last set of results in this block refer to the estimation of the wage curve accounting for a possible selection 
bias. As mentioned before, each model had a different first stage estimation. All of them were based on probit 
models, but the dependent variable in the selection regression was specific for each case. For instance, in the case 
of the model for the formal sector in rural areas, the selection equation compared individuals in the formal sector 
against all other workers (including those in the informal sector) and people out of the labour force. Moreover, in

the second stage, all models were estimated with IV (and the instrument was the logarithm of the time lag of the 
unemployment rate). The results of Table 5 indicated that wage flexibility in the rural sector seemed to be even 
stronger when selection bias over observable characteristics was taken into account. In the case of Model 5b, the 
instrument did not explain much of the unemployment rate, generating problems for the estimation of the second 
stage of the IV model. 

In summary, the analysis of the wage curve with state-level data provided some insights into the differences of 
wage  flexibility  between  urban and  rural areas.  In  fact, more accessibility  to alternative  jobs  in agglomerated 
urban areas seemed to reduce the bargaining power of firms, decreasing their capacity to change offered wages 
according to the business cycle. There was also indication of labour market dualism and a much higher wage 
flexibility  could  be  found  in  the  informal  sector,  in  accordance  with  the  literature  and  with  previous  results 
discussed here (Section 3).  

6.4 City size, spatial dependence, and the wage curve 

There  is  a  strong  concern  of  whether  state-level  regional  aggregation  is  satisfactory  for  the  estimation  of  the 
wage curve. It is not clear if the unemployment rate in such large areas can substantially affect the decisions of 
economic agents at a more disaggregated local level. Furthermore, the state-level unemployment rate does not 
vary much between individuals, decreasing its explanatory power over the variation of wages. These issues may 
affect the estimation results. This subsection will be based on a multi-level analysis (see Subsection 5.2.1) and 
will  explore  the  wage  curve  in  a  more  disaggregated  context  (municipalities),  controlling  for  urban  size, 
proximity, spatial dependence, and a possible endogeneity of the unemployment rate. 

6.4.1 Description of the database – Demographic Census 

The analysis that follows was based on information obtained from the demographic censuses of 1991, 2000 and 
2010.  The  analysis  is  done  over  Immediate  Region  of  Urban  Articulation  (REGIC  areas),  that  constitutes  a 
labour market area  (IBGE, 2007).  Their configuration  was  harmonised  with  the 1991-2010 MCAs,  obtaining 
478  REGIC  areas.6  Once  again,  only  male  individuals  aged  15  to  59  years  old,  employed  with  or  without  a 
formal contract, working from 20 to 60 hours per week were kept. Furthermore, individuals without information 
about the location of their jobs were excluded. Wages in 2000 were deflated to real values of August 2010 by the 
national INPC index of the period. In addition, a sampling procedure was adopted to generate a computationally 
manageable  database.  The  original  sample  in  2000  comprised  2,237,102  interviews,  representing  19,381,332 
individuals in the population. In 2010, these numbers were 2,706,474 and 26,290,915, respectively. 

Finally, the results that follow were based in two-stage regressions (see Subsection 5.2.1), with the spatial wage 
obtained in the first stage being considered as the dependent variable in the second stage. However, there is not 
enough information  to obtain  estimates  for  all MCAs,  because  the  sample does not  cover the  whole  country. 
Then, when spatial dependence was explicitly considered in the second stage, it was necessary to input values 
for the missing data, and this was done by calculating the average of the spatial wage among the neighbours7.  

6.4.2 Descriptive statistics 

The main descriptive statistics of the Census database show that real wages increased between 2000 and 2010. 
Over  this  period,  education  attainment  of  the  population  also  went  up,  and  workers  were  dislocated  from 
agriculture to commerce and services. Manufacture had a relevant participation in the total employment analysed 
in this database, followed by occupations in commerce and service8. The first stage estimation generates a spatial 
wage at the MCA-year level, which then is used in the second stage as the dependent variable. Then, the upper 
part of Table 10 shows the mean spatial wages in 2000 for each group of MCAs, classified according to their 
density. It is noticeable that the spatial wage is higher for denser MCAs, in which it is also possible to find higher 
unemployment rates. However, the comparison of the estimated spatial wages for different sectors because they 
result from different regressions.

7 This procedure was adopted for 18 MCAs in 2000 and 3 MCAs in 2010 for the whole labour market (formal and informal), 
454 MCAs in 2000 and 170 MCAs in 2010 for the formal sector, and 63 in 2000 and 29 in 2010 for the informal sector.

6.4.3 Results 

 

The main focus of this subsection is in the relationship between the spatial wage and the local unemployment 
rate. This spatial wage is obtained as the MCA-year effect net of observed individual characteristics9. The initial 
results  of  the  second  stage  are  presented  in  Table  7.  First  of  all,  the  spatial  wage  of  the  informal  sector  is 
negatively correlated with the local unemployment rate, while for the total and the formal sectors the results are 
not  significant  (Models  1  to  3).  When  these  results  are  disaggregated  by  different  density  levels,  the  wage 
elasticity to the local unemployment rate is negative for all density classes in the informal sector, while for the 
formal  sector,  whenever  this  elasticity  is  negative,  it  is  significant.  There  is  a  U  shape  relationship  between 
wages and the unemployment rate according to density levels. This elasticity is higher in absolute terms for low 
and high-density MCAs, while it is lower for medium-density MCAs. 

As  mentioned  in  Section  5,  the  local  unemployment  rate  may  be  endogenous  to  the  wage  level.  Therefore, 
Models 7 to 12 provide a tentative instrumental variables estimation, with the 10-year lag of the unemployment 
rate  as  an  instrument  (and  the  lagged  unemployment  rate  iterated  with  density  groups).  Now,  all  significant 
coefficients are negative, corroborating the expected shape of the wage curve, but the formal sector is the only 
one that presents a significant elasticity for all MCAs (Models 7 to 9). However, there is a potential problem 
here. Local unobserved characteristics of the labour markets may be affecting the results. Therefore, in Table 8, 
fixed effects for MCAs are included. These results are very different from the main conclusions obtained from 
Table7. In fact, areas with higher population density will show a lower level of wage flexibility. Therefore, the 
main conclusions obtained from Table 7 were being driven by unobserved local effects. 

Finally, the last set of results allows for the existence of neighbourhood effects. As mentioned previously, the 
empirical literature has started to include not only the spatial lag of the unemployment rate as an explanatory 
variable, but also to control for spatial dependence. Models 1, 6 and 11 in Table 9 present the basic specification: 
the spatial wage is explained by local characteristics and the local unemployment rate. In this first estimation, 
LM  tests  indicated  that  the  spatial  autoregressive  model  (SAR)  seemed  to  be  the  most  appropriate  spatial 
specification.  Then,  the  spatial  lag  of  the  unemployment  rate  was  included  in  Models  2,  7  and  12.  Then,  the 
informal sector not only had a higher elasticity for the local unemployment rate, but also for the unemployment 
rate in the neighbouring areas. This formulation does not tackle the spatial dependence, according to LM tests. 
One last try before estimating the SAR model is to control for unobserved local characteristics, with MCA fixed 
effects.  As  expected,  the  elasticity  of  wages  in  relation  to  local  unemployment  rates  has  decreased,  but  the 
informal sector still showed the highest coefficients (Models 3, 8, 13).

In Models 4, 9 and 14, the estimation of a SAR model without local fixed effects indicates that the lag of the 
dependent variable is significant, but the unemployment elasticity becomes non-significant (at least for the total 
labour  market).  However,  the  coefficient  for  the  spatial  lag  of  the  unemployment  rate  is  still  negative  and 
significant. Finally, the last three models (5, 10 and 15) indicate that whenever a SAR model with spatial fixed 
effects is estimated, the elasticity of the spatial wage to the local unemployment rate is very similar in the local 
level for the informal and the formal sectors (-0.023 and -0.024). However, the elasticity for the unemployment 
rate in the neighbours is much higher for the informal sector (-0.117, against -0.038 in the formal sector). 

In sum, the estimation of the wage curve with disaggregated data shows that it is important to include spatial 
effects in the estimated model. In fact, the theoretical framework discussed in Section 4 had already indicated

that whenever another local labour market is sufficiently close to the region analysed, it is possible that workers 
look  for  opportunities  in  these  neighbouring  areas.  This  effect  is  supposed  to  be  even  more  important  here 
because REGIC areas (local labour markets) are composed by MCAs (the spatial unit of analysis). Therefore, a 
common shock inside the REGIC area is supposed to affect  all MCAs that  compose it, with spillover  effects 
between them. This result indicates that there are relevant spatial effects inside a common labour market area. In 
addition, workers in the informal sector seem to be more affected by these neighbourhood effects. This analysis 
is complemented by the results presented in Table 10. In that case, all models include the iteration between the 
local unemployment rate and the density group of the MCA. Furthermore, the inclusion of spatial effects is done 
through the iteration of the spatial lag of the unemployment rate and density groups.

The comparison of Models 1, 6 and 11 of Table 10 indicate that there is a higher wage flexibility in the informal 
sector. The elasticity of the spatial wage in relation to the local unemployment rate follows a U-shaped curve 
according  to  the  local  density.  These  results  corroborate  the  initial  conclusions  obtained  in  Tables  8  and  9. 
Furthermore, spillover effects seemed to be more relevant for the informal sector, especially when fixed effects 
at  the  MCA  level  are  taken  into  account  (Models  3,  8  and  13).  A  great  share  of  the  difference  in  the  wage 
flexibility between the formal and the informal sectors is captured by the spatial lag of the unemployment rate. 
This is an indication that the whole labour market area (REGIC area) seems to be more relevant for workers in 
the informal sector, while workers in the formal sector are usually more influenced by the unemployment rate at 
the MCA in which they are currently working. 

Once again, LM tests indicated that a spatial autoregressive model would be more adequate to deal with spatial 
dependence.  Combining  the  spatial  lag  of  the  dependent  variable  (spatial  wage)  with  density  groups  and 
controlling  for  local  fixed  effects,  Models  5,  10  and  15  showed  that  the  wage  flexibility  in  relation  to  the 
business cycle is much higher in absolute values in the informal sector, for low-density MCAs. In fact, these 
conclusions  meet  the  predictions  of  the  model  discussed  in  Section  4,  in  which  a  worker  employed  in  a  less 
dense  labour  market  has  a  lower  bargaining  power.  Being  surrounded  by  fewer  job  opportunities  (higher 
unemployment rates in the neighbouring areas) reduces once again workers’ bargaining power, and allow firms 
to adjust real wages according to the moment of the economy. The preferred estimates are Models 5, 10 and 15 
of Tables 9 and 10. They provide comparisons between the formal and the informal sectors and the whole labour 
market, control for unobserved local characteristics and try to deal with spatial dependence.  From Table 9, the 
estimated wage elasticity in relation to the unemployment rate is very similar for the formal and the informal 
sectors  (-0.024  and  -0.023,  respectively),  but  its  spatial  lag  has  a  much  larger  coefficient  in  the  case  of  the 
informal sector (-0.117, against -0.038 for the formal sector). 

The main conclusions of these results are the following: (i) wage flexibility is higher in less dense local labour 
markets; (ii) wages in the informal sector are more flexible than in the formal sector; (iii) it is essential to control 
for unobserved local characteristics in order to obtain the ‘true’ elasticity of wages to local unemployment rates; 
(iv) it is important to control for spatial effects when the unit of analysis is rather small; (v) a significant part of 
the difference between the formal and the informal sectors originates from spatial effects. 

7  Conclusion 

This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the wage curve in Brazil, exploring different databases 
in order to obtain a deep understanding of the mechanisms that are behind the process of wage bargaining. In 
order to do so, a theoretical framework combining wage bargaining, institutional costs and efficiency wages was 
designed, distinguishing the formal and the informal sectors by the relative level of bargaining power of workers 
employed in each of them. Many empirical issues were investigated, aiming to understand their influence on the 
relationship  of  wages  and  local  unemployment  rates.  Among  them,  we  highlighted  multilevel  analysis, 
endogeneity  of  the  unemployment  rate,  selection  bias,  spatial  dependence,  and  the  degree  to  which  the  wage 
curve is dynamic or not. 

The first set of results examined the wage curve in a more aggregated context, for six metropolitan regions. The 
informal sector seems be more flexible to economic downturns. This result seems to corroborate other findings 
in  the  literature  for  the  wage  curve  in  developing  economies.  In  the  particular  case  of  PME,  the  inclusion  of 
individual fixed effects does not leave enough variation to capture the wage curve relationship. State-level data 
from PNAD provided some new insights into the differences of wage flexibility between urban and rural areas. 
In fact,  a higher accessibility to alternative jobs in agglomerated urban areas seemed to reduce the bargaining 
power of firms, decreasing their capacity to change offered wages according to the business cycle. There was 
also an indication of labour market dualism while a much higher wage flexibility could be found in the informal 
sector, as supported by the literature (Section 3).  

Finally, Census data seems to provide the best regional disaggregation to study the wage curve in Brazil. When 
local  characteristics  are  adequately  controlled  for,  our  findings  suggest  that  wage  flexibility  is  higher  in  less 
dense local labour markets and wages in the informal sector are much more adjustable than those in the formal 
sector.  Furthermore,  spatial  dependence  is  a  relevant  issue  to  account  for  all  possible  effects  related  to  the 

20 

 
accessibility of jobs to neighbouring areas and for common shocks at the local labour market level. In this sense, 
a  large  part  of  the  difference  between  the  formal  and  the  informal  sector  is  due  to  the  spatial  lag  of  the 
unemployment rate. All these empirical results imply that labour market dualism is an essential ingredient in the 
evaluation of the wage curve in developing economies. When this analysis is done in the appropriate aggregation 
level, we are able to identify a relevant impact of city size on the relative bargaining power of workers and firms.
