Resumo 
Uma  crise  econômica  pode  ter  origem  nas  condições  macroeconômicas  internas  ou  nas  mudanças  da 
conjuntura/estrutura econômica internacional. A crise brasileira recente, que começou em 2014, teve, como 
características principais, o descontrole da inflação e das contas públicas, que exigiu uma política monetária 
contracionista  que  resultou  em  uma  das  mais  intensas  e  prolongadas  recessões  na  história  econômica 
brasileira.  Paralelamente,  a  conjuntura  econômica  internacional  mostrou-se  bastante  adversa,  com 
oscilações nos preços das commodities, o fim do programa de Quantitative Easing nos EUA e uma relativa 
perda de dinamismo na economia mundial, a despeito da recuperação econômica dos EUA. Nesse contexto, 
o presente trabalho tem o objetivo de avaliar se fatores internos, como a taxa de juros brasileira e a formação 
bruta de capital fixo, entre outros, ou externos, como os preços das commodities e o crescimento econômico 
mundial, podem ter afetado o desempenho econômico brasileiro.  Como metodologia, a pesquisa utiliza 
testes de precedência com o objetivo de verificar se os determinantes internos e externos precederam, “no 
sentido de granger”, o PIB brasileiro. Entre os resultados encontrados pela pesquisa, foi possível identificar 
que tanto variáveis de natureza interna quanto de natureza externa precederam o PIB brasileiro, sugerindo 
que a crise tenha se originado de uma combinação da fatores domésticos e externos.

Abstract 
An  economic  crisis  may  have  originated  in  the  internal  macroeconomic  conditions  or  changes  in  the 
environment / international economic structure. The recent Brazilian crisis, which began in 2014, had as its 
main features, a lack of inflation and public accounts, which required a contractionary monetary policy, 
resulting in one of the most intense and prolonged recessions in Brazilian economic history. In parallel, the 
international economic situation proved to be very adverse, with fluctuations in commodity prices, the end 
of  the  Quantitative  Easing  program  in  the  US  and  a  relative  loss  of  momentum  in  the  global  economy, 
despite the US economic recovery. In this context, this study aims to evaluate whether internal factors, such 
as the Brazilian interest rates and gross fixed capital formation, among others or external factors, such as 
commodity prices and global economic growth, may have affected Brazilian economic performance. For 
its  methodology,  the  research  uses  precedence  tests  in  order  to  verify  that  the  internal  and  external 
determinants preceded it, “in the sense of Granger,” the Brazilian GDP. Among the findings of the research, 
it was possible to identify both internal nature of variables and external nature preceded the Brazilian GDP, 
suggesting that the crisis originated from a combination of domestic and external factors.

1. Introduction 
 

From 2003 to 2008, the Brazilian economy was marked by economic growth combined with price 
stability.  In  2009,  the  real  GDP  had  negative  growth.  The  point  fall  in  GDP  in  2009  was  due  to  the 
international financial crisis that began in the US. In parallel, the international scenario was favorable and 
a lasting cycle of high commodity prices benefited the emerging countries in the first decade of this century. 
However,  early  in  the  next  decade,  Brazil’s  economic  growth  started  to  lose  momentum,  but  the  fiscal 
stimulus policies, through increased spending and tax cuts, coupled with monetary policy more lenient with 
inflation, continued to stimulate the market work through to 2014. 

Between  2014  and  2016,  the  Brazilian  economy  faced  one  of  the  worst  recessions  in  history. 
According to the Business Cycle Dating Committee of (Codace) of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, there 
was a Brazilian economic crisis that lasted for 11 consecutive quarters from the second quarter of 2014 to 
the last in 2016. The government’s official discourse and the economic team in the period when the crisis 
began it was that an international economic crisis would have “contaminated” the Brazilian economy. Thus, 
the domestic economic policy  would have little or no interference in  the crisis.  In fact,  economic crises 
have  many  variables  and  can  be  derived  from  multiple  causes  because  they  depend  on  the  economic 
characteristics  of  each  country  and  the  country’s  degree  of  integration  with  the  world  economy,  among 
other factors. 

It should be noted that in the period leading up to the crisis, there were changes that were not only 
internal, but also external in nature. From the internal point of view, the “Macroeconomic Tripod,” which 
consisted of the combination of primary surplus with inflation targeting and a floating exchange rate regime, 
was replaced by the so-called “New Economic Matrix,” which, according to Person (2013), consisted of an 
interpretation that was a combination of real interest rate of the Brazilian economy being set at high levels, 
combined with an appreciated exchange rate. In this scenario, the state should take a more interventionist 
and protectionist role in not only reducing the real interest rate, as well as expanding subsidized credit and 
devaluing the exchange rate, among other actions. 

In this context, this paper’s research object is to analyze the causes of the Brazilian economic crisis 
from 2014 to 2016, with the research problem the following question: was the economic crisis of the period 
2014-2016 caused by internal conduct of macroeconomic policy or by the international scene? The search 
for the answer to the research problem involves some intermediate goals, such as the approach of the pillars 
of  the  main  Brazilian  economic  policies  that  preceded  the  crisis,  and  verification  of  possible  biases  in 
national economic policies that have worsened the scenario. The work is justified by the need to understand 
the  determinants  of  the  largest  recorded  recessions  since  the  early  twentieth  century.  For  Codace,  the 
Brazilian  economic  crisis  that  lasted  for  11  consecutive  quarters,  had  an  accumulated  loss  of  Gross 
Domestic  Product  (GDP)  of  8.6%  in  these  11  quarters.  The  revision  of  the  national  accounts  by  IBGE 
showed a decrease in this period by 8.2%, which puts the recession period from 1981-83 as deeper than the 
recent. Despite the differences between the scenarios, the recovery process has proved slow compared to 
other crises experienced by Brazil. It is necessary, then, to analyze the structure of the Brazilian economy 
at  the  time,  along  with  its  main  pillars,  since,  in  the  period  leading  up  to  the  crisis,  the  country  was 
experiencing a growth cycle in the main sectors of the economy with record levels in the employment rate 
and increased income in the most disadvantaged classes.  

From  this  view,  the  article  is  structured  as  follows.  After  this  introduction,  the  next  section  will 
cover the theoretical framework on crisis and the debate about the causes of the crisis in Brazil, with  an 
emphasis on monetary and fiscal issues. In Section 3, a historical evolution of the Brazilian economy will 
be presented with the transition from the Macroeconomic Tripod for the New Economic Matrix. Later, in 
Section 4, the research methodology will be presented, which consists of applying Granger precedence tests 
in  order to  identify the variables of internal  or external  nature preceded the Brazilian GDP behavior.  In 
Section 5, the results and discussion will be presented. Finally, Section 6 presents the final considerations.

2. Theoretical Framework 
 

The impact of economic crises can vary according to the characteristics of each country, such as 
dependence on the international  market,  debt  and economic  expansion policies, among  others. To Fiani 
(2011), excessive state intervention in the economy can damage the economic environment, since the state 
has no entrepreneurial ability, and often acts in the economy with interests that are opposed to those that 
generate economic growth. Excessive intervention may occur through excessive regulation of the economy 
and in  commercial practices, which may lead to  a significant  decline in  the potential growth  rate of the 
economy. 

According to Filgueiras and Gonçalves (2007), the regulatory policies bring losses as transaction 
costs  attached  to  them  and  encouraging  opportunistic  relationships  between  public  and  private  actors, 
generating, for example, corruption. Thus, government failures happen when there is systemic inefficiency. 
Since there are transaction costs that arise from regulatory policies, there is thus asymmetric information in 
markets and institutional weaknesses and allocative activities, generating stunts and preferences between 
state and private actors, culminating in loans with subsidized interest rates and special terms and even with 
a preference for investments in politically stronger regions, to the detriment of others. Kindleberger and 
Aliber  (2016)  point  out  that  each  of  the  various  crises  in  history  follow  a  credit  expansion  and  credit 
expansions related to international capital flows. In this sense, there is a combination of internal and external 
factors that cause a crisis.Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) analyzed the determinants of the subprime crisis and 
identify both internal and external factors, such as potential determinants, of the 2008 US crisis.  

Gordon (2005) points out that the literature indicates at least 60 variables affecting the development 
and growth of the economy. The variables focus primarily on structural changes to mitigate government 
failures and its harmful effects on the economy as a whole. On the other hand, the author points out that 
internationalized economies are more susceptible to impacts of the international economic situation, since 
the  global  economic  environment  generates  interdependence  among  countries.  In  this  sense,  Baumann, 
Canuto and Gonçalves (2004), state that the degree of impact on open economies depends on three main 
factors: the magnitude of the internal market, the variety of import and export and technological capacity, 
and  trade  and  monetary  policy.  There  are  several  mechanisms  for  the  international  spread  of  economic 
instability or international economic cycles, and these mechanisms can be classified among the different 
spheres of international economic relations, such as the commercial, productive, technological, monetary 
and financial as Gordon (2005) noted. In the commercial sphere, the most obvious mechanism is the ratio 
of  exports  of  the  country  and  world  income.  The  multiplier  with  external  repercussions  expresses  this 
interdependence between macroeconomic aggregates two countries. For this reason, international economic 
crises may give rise to protectionist pressures worldwide, which is called a trade war (climbing protectionist 
measures). Even in the commercial sphere, global crises tend to promote competition in the world market 
via  currency  war  (climbing  exchange  rate  devaluations).  The  trade  and  foreign  exchange  wars  are 
instruments of mercantilist output economic crises. Countries with a high degree of export specialization 
in commodities are more susceptible to international economic instability, due to the inconsistency of the 
terms of trade resulting from trade and currency wars as Gordon (2005) showed. 

In  the  productive  sphere,  the  main  mechanisms  involve  strategies,  conduct  and  performance  of 
transnational or global enterprises. Countries with the highest degree of internationalization of production 
(denationalization) are more likely to have flows of goods, services, intangible assets and capital. In the 
context  of  a  global  crisis,  these  dependent  countries  suffer  most  from  the  re-allocation  of  resources  by 
transnational  corporations.  In  the  monetary  sphere,  while  the  world  economy  thrives,  there  is  an 
extraordinary increase mechanism of international financial flows, i.e., local banks capture the low interest 
rates,  foreign  currency  funds  and  lend  in  the  national  currency,  in  accordance  with  Harding  and  Pagan 
(2006).  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  world  economy  is  going  through  a  less  favorable  stage  with  the 
international liquidity contraction, there is no recovery of portfolios on a global scale and there is increased 
risk  aversion.  Harding  and  Pagan  (2006)  argue  that  countries  with  high  structural  external  vulnerability 
(due  to,  for  example,  high  net  external  liabilities  and  governance  deficits)  are  more  likely  to  suffer 
speculative attacks.

Filgueiras and Gonçalves (2007) point out that fiscal management is a key element in determining 
the dynamics of monetary economies of production and that fiscal policy influences, by various channels 
on  aggregate  demand:  directly,  through  taxes,  spending,  current  transfers  and  public  investment;  and 
indirectly  through  the  multiplier  effect  on  private  consumption  and  investment.  Baumann,  Canuto  and 
Gonçalves  (2004)  add  that  fiscal  policy  can  affect  economic  growth  in  both  the  short  and  long  term, 
including  favoring  the  occurrence  of  structural  changes,  due  to  its  effects  on  investments.  However, 
Filgueiras  and  Gonçalves  (2007)  point  out  that  since  the  emergence  and  consolidation  of  theories  and 
liberalizing macroeconomic policies in the 1980s, the discussion of the fiscal policy impacts on aggregate 
demand and growth started to show a relevant change: it is up to monetary policy to intervene in aggregate 
demand and maintain price stability through interest and exchange rates, variables that, in turn, affect the 
trajectory  of  debt  and  GDP,  while  fiscal  policy  must  compensate  for  these  effects  on  debt  and  increase 
fiscal effort when any threat to the stability of the debt trajectory is found. Baumann, Canuto and Gonçalves 
(2004) point out that public finances have become an important means of assessing the financial and capital 
markets, as indicators such as the primary surplus and the net debt of the public sector became part of the 
list  of  country  risk  indicators  and  have  been  incorporated  into  the  analysis  of  “national  economic 
fundamentals” that are the basis for the confidence of investors. 

In this context, many countries, especially developing ones, have adopted essentially austere fiscal 
policy, despite the evolution of its economy in the short and medium term according to Blanchard (2004). 
These  countries  also  subjected  their  fiscal  management  to  the  wishes  of  monetary  policy  and  the 
indispensability of stabilizing their economy, leaving ultimately, background economic growth. It was the 
need for a nominal anchor for inflation expectations of economic agents that led to the adoption of inflation 
targeting system in which the primary task of monetary policy is to control inflation. In this new monetary 
policy framework, inflation control is mainly for setting the value of the basic interest rate. Moreover, the 
growth  rates  of  monetary  aggregates  -  M1,  M2  or  M3  -  is  not  a  variable  over  which  central  banks  are 
interested in exercise any control according to Blanchard (2004). To Oreiro and Feijó (2010), the evolution 
of theory and monetary policy practice in developed countries has shown that the growing instability in the 
velocity of circulation of the currency, observed in those countries after the 1970s, made excessively fragile 
the relationship between the rate inflation and the growth rate of the monetary reference unit. 

Blinder (1999) points out that this phenomenon led economists to develop a new way of controlling 
inflation. For the author, the Central Bank should focus on the relationship between the rate of real effective 
interest rates and the real interest rate balance, instead of controlling the increase in the money supply. In 
this context, Blinder (1999) considers that the proper functioning of the inflation targeting system requires 
that the monetary authorities respond to the fundamental issues in the economy such as: What should be 
the target inflation rate pursued by the Central Bank? Should a zero inflation target be pursued in the long 
run? If not, what is the optimal rate of inflation? Should the responsibility for setting the inflation target fit 
the Central Bank or any other institution, as in the Brazilian case, CMN? How do you determine inflation 
expectations? Do these expectations reflect the perception of future developments in the inflation rate of 
formation of prices agents? Or do they just reflect the views of financial market operators? The answers to 
these questions define the governance structure of monetary policy, i.e. the institutional framework in which 
monetary policy is conducted. This model includes not only the set of institutions underlying the operation 
of monetary policy, but also those involved in the preparation and implementation of this policy. To Blinder 
(1999),  the  objectives  of  economic  policy  should  be  determined  by  broad  debate  among  the  various 
representative  segments  of  society.  In  the  specific  case  of  monetary  policy,  the  goals  should  reflect  the 
balance achieved between the “degree of social aversion” to inflation and the “degree of social aversion” 
to  the  loss  of  production  and  employment  resulting  from  disinflation  policy.  However,  in  the  current 
structure, the inflation targets do not reflect a social consensus on the “optimal rate of inflation” in the long 
run, much less about the speed at which this long-term goal to be achieved. 

For  Gordon  (2005),  the  inflation  targeting  system,  the  cyclical  action  against  the  Central  Bank, 
should not pose a risk to stability in the long term, since there would be a resulting inflationary bias of time 
inconsistency in the conduct of economic policy, without any benefit in terms of output and employment 
in the long run. As for Busato and Cavalcanti (2009), the credibility of economic policy is important, since 

3 

 

 
the agents use rational expectations to make decisions, creating the need for consistency of macroeconomic 
policies over time. Therefore, the monetary authority should be committed to the maintenance of stability 
and the achievement of goals. The realization of the desired goals, however, would only be possible with a 
largely independent Central Bank, that could take decisions without hierarchical subordination to any other 
bureaucratic agency. This, in theory, would eliminate the inflationary bias and, indirectly, favor economic 
growth. 

Considering  the  importance  of  both  monetary  policy  as  fiscal  policy  in  the  context  of  economic 
crisis, associated with external nature problems, as demand for exports depends on the global economy and 
consequently  affect  the  exchange  rate,  Balassiano  (2018)  analyzed,  using  the  synthetic  control  method, 
which factors (internal or external) were mainly responsible for the Brazilian economic crisis. Among the 
findings, the author pointed out that the internal factors were mainly responsible for the deterioration in the 
Brazilian  economy.  The  author  used  a  final  sample  of  14  countries,  which  do  not  necessarily  have 
convergent characteristics with the Brazilian economy, for synthetic control, which does not invalidate the 
results  of  the  study,  but  it  may  cause  some  bias  in  the  results.  In  addition,  the  country  chosen  as  the 
“placebo” for the analysis was Chile, which, according to the author, was the Latin American country that 
was characterized by the adoption of conventional macroeconomic policies in the analysis period. However, 
as was also highlighted by Borges (2017), the Chilean economy has a particular characteristic which cannot 
be ignored: it is the only emerging country that applies a counter-cyclical fiscal regime from the behavior 
of commodity prices, reducing both economic growth in the high cycles, as well as the drop in the economy 
in periods of low commodity prices, such as an automatic stabilizer.  

In  the  same  line  of  argument,  Balassiano  (2018)  and  Matos  (2016)  showed  that  external  factors 
cannot explain the slowdown of the Brazilian economy in  recent  years. Matos (2016) used a panel data 
model that included indicators for assessment of external shocks, such as the growth rate of the US and 
China, the options volatility index on the S & P 500 (VIX), the interest rate US 10 years and the terms of 
trade. As domestic factors, the variables analyzed were the investment and inflation rates, interest rates, the 
current account as a share of GDP, the output gap and the nominal deficit. 

Cubeddu et al. (2014) analyzed the impact of external shocks on developing countries and listed out 
from  the  point  of  view  of  external  shocks,  the  following  variables  as  relevant:  financial  and  trade 
liberalization,  trade  terms,  the  share  of  exports  to  the  Eurozone,  China  and  the  US  and  exports  of 
commodities in a sample of 54 countries from 2000 to 2013. The data study found that countries such as 
Chile, Peru and Venezuela were more affected than Brazil for the international scene, with the Brazilian 
economy occupying an intermediate position in terms of external impacts on the economy. 

In  contrast,  Borges  (2016)  and  Borges  (2017)  showed  that  domestic  economic  policies  did  not 
constitute the main determinant of the Brazilian crisis. Highlighting the fact that there was a long cycle of 
high commodity prices and comparing the Brazilian economy with countries with similar characteristics, 
the  author  states  that  exogenous  factors  to  domestic  economic  policy  and  any  unmapped  determinants 
explain the crisis in the interval between the percentages 40% and 60%. Borges (2016) and Borges (2017) 
points out the internal economic policies as being responsible for levels located in the 10% - 30% range 
drop  in  Brazilian  product  responsibility  during  the  crisis.  The  author  points  out  that  the  problems  of 
corruption that led to write-downs and the possibility of Petrobras’ insolvency affected the sovereign risk 
and the perception of agents on public accounts, and the fall in international oil prices from the end of 2014 
was the major determinant of the deterioration of the company’s value. Thus, concluded the author, the 
domestic economic policy has reduced share of responsibility in the Brazilian recession. 

Reinhart, Reinhart and Trebesch (2016) pointed out that the recent cycle of high commodity prices 
from 1999 to 2011, was one of the longest in history. The authors state that capital flows and fluctuations 
in commodity prices, as well as fluctuations in international interest rates, have been historically connected 
with episodes of financial crises and, according to estimates, the recent boom in commodity prices was the 
second highest since the eighteenth century and one of the four long cycles since 1815. the authors found 
evidence  of  financial  crises,  given  by  sovereign  default  in  subsequent  scenarios  to  high-end  cycles  in 
commodity prices.

3. Historical Evolution: From “Tripod Macroeconomic” to the “New Economic Matrix” 
 

The  analysis  of  the  relationship  between  developmentalism  and  populism  is  recurrent  in  the 
evolution  of  Brazilian  economic  history.  The  issue  has  even  returned  to  the  agenda  with  the  approach 
of new developmentalism and its proposal for a national development project that is not worth the “old” 
developmentalism, which would be saturated with populist practices as noted by Oreiro and Feijó (2010). 
The new developmentalism can be defined, according to Oreiro (2012) as a set of economic policies and 
institutional proposals that can cause the countries of intermediate development to reach the average income 
level  of  developed  countries.  In  this  context,  the  15  years  that  followed  the  end  of  World  War  II  were 
marked by the expansion of the Brazilian economy at a faster pace than any other Latin American country. 
The  annual  average  growth  rate  of  Brazil’s  GDP  in  this  period  was,  in  fact,  one  of  the  world’s  largest, 
surpassed in the West only by Germany, and in the East, only by Japan and the small economies of South 
Korea  and  Taiwan.  In  fact,  between  1946  and  1960,  the  annual  average  growth  rate  of  the  Brazilian 
economy was 6.3%; to Germany, 10.5%; Japan’s 9.1%; to South Korea, 6.5%; and Taiwan, 7.6%, according 
to  Maddison  (1997).  However,  the  early  1960s  marked  the  end  of  this  era  of  accelerated  growth  of  the 
Brazilian economy. Between 1963 and 1967, the rate of the country’s economic growth fell to half of that 
recorded in the previous decade, generating a heated debate about the type of economic reform that would 
be able to rescue the historical rates, as shown by Earp and Prado (2003). 

Some defended the separation between the economic and political spheres because they believed 
that the economy was rational, while the policy was passionate. Thus, the market with its rational pricing 
system, would ensure by itself economic development. State actions, on the other hand, would be innocuous 
or  even  harmful  to  the  economy,  according  to  Bresser-Pereira  (1982).  Others  understood  that  state 
interventions (mainly monetary instability) were at the heart of the Brazilian delay. For liberal economists, 
therefore, the idea was wrong that overcoming the crisis of development would be possible on the basis of 
reform and state intervention in the economy. In fact, excessive state intervention and neglect of economic 
stability  would  be  the  main  reasons  for  the  persistence  of  the  Brazilian  economic  backwardness.  These 
economists argued, therefore, that economic populism was the root of the problem, as it generated monetary 
instability and an inadequate climate for the expansion of private investment, according to Bresser-Pereira 
(1982). 

According to Bresser-Pereira (1982), there are three sources of imbalance in populism. Populism in 
fiscal policy, which led the state to carry out expenses that exceeded its tax collection capacity, generating 
inflationary  pressures;  populism  in  credit  policy,  which  financed  the  investment  with  expansion  of  the 
money supply, and not an increase in domestic savings, leading to a new source of inflationary pressure; 
and populism in wage policy, which led to an increase in payrolls higher than productivity growth. 

In this context, further to the developmentalism of the discussion, in 1999 the Brazilian economy 
got rid of one of the last bands of the stabilization process implemented in 1994: the rigidity of the exchange 
rate regime. Since then, a regime of inflation targeting was implemented. According to Oreiro (2015), in 
1999,  there  also  began  a  macroeconomic  policy  regime  that  became  known  as  the  “Macroeconomic 
Tripod,” that was based on the primary surplus combination with targeting regime inflation and floating 
exchange rate. Also according to Oreiro (2015), already in 2006 this regime had undergone transformations, 
with the change in accounting for investments in the primary surplus target. Other measures, such as the 
abandonment of the downward trend in inflation targets and the Brazilian Central Bank’s role in the foreign 
exchange market to minimize the nominal appreciation of the exchange rate, have made the tripod more 
flexible and stimulated the economy through incentives on the demand side. Morais and Saad-Filho (2011) 
showed that, from 2006, and especially in 2007-2010, the inflection of macroeconomic policy resulted in 
GDP growth. According to the authors, several aspects of the new macroeconomic matrix were defended 
by the new developmentalism. 

According to Jorge and Martins (2013), the financial crisis caused by the fall of Lehman Brothers 
in September 2008 had a significant impact on the world economy, reversing the trend of economic growth 
trajectory. The Brazilian economy was heavily impacted by the crisis and in the fourth quarter of 2008, 
GDP fell by an annualized 14.7% in the quarterly comparison. At the international level, the financial crisis 

5 

 

 
brought  a  significant  worsening  of  the  fiscal  situation  of  the  vast  majority  of  countries,  especially  the 
developed ones, requiring huge efforts from governments to rescue systemically important institutions. It 
is noteworthy, however, that even other countries that were not directly involved with the huge credit boom 
directed at real estate were not immune to the crisis. The degree of integration between financial markets 
was such that the derivatives originating from troubled countries hit financial institutions around the world. 
Although there was, in the years preceding the crisis, improvement in debt indicators in the country, there 
were no adjustments promoted to curb the rising government spending.

In  response  to  the  effects  of  the  crisis,  the  government  deepened  the  easing  of  Macroeconomic 
Tripod, as highlighted by Oreiro (2015). According to Jorge and Martins (2013), the government postponed 
the collection of taxes, such as the Tax on  Industrialized Products  (IPI), the Social  Integration Program 
(PIS),  the  Contribution  to  Social  Security  Financing  (Cofins)  and  the  tax  income  withholding  and 
accelerated the return of tax credits for businesses. Spending on the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) 
and social programs were maintained and scaled up, especially by the Treasury loans, public banks (mainly 
Bank  of  Brazil  and  Caixa  Economica  Federal)  and  the  National  Bank  for  Economic  and  Social 
Development ( BNDES). 

It is worth noting that one instrument that is important in the implementation of government stimulus 
is expandsion of  the BNDES balance sheet. The policy was aimed at the establishment / creation of national 
champions and the choice of “strategic” sectors that received subsidies, such as the automotive industry, 
and protection (in the form of local content and the price) in the case of the shipping industry, to name only 
two  examples.  Note  that  the  growing  volume  of  BNDES  disbursements  was  concentrated  to  large  and 
medium industries, especially the construction sector, as well as energy and food. As shown in Figure 1, 
there was a growth trend of the 2008 disbursements until 2013, when disbursements reached a total of R 
$190 billion. From then on, there is a reversal in disbursements in 2017, with values lower than in 2008 in 
nominal terms. 

Jorge and Martins  (2013) point out  that the permission  given by the  Budget  Guidelines  Law for 
abatement investments and exemptions from the primary surplus target required a lower tax effort from the 
viewpoint  of  control  of  expenses  and  allowed  the  expansion  of  public  spending  to  expand  aggregate 
demand.  Even  with  a  government  effort  to  achieve  the  primary  surplus  targets  not  slaughtered  by 
investments and tax relief, the authors point out that the deepening of the European crisis and uncertainty 
in the international environment, in addition to the drop in international commodity prices and Brazilian 
exports, generated effects on the slowdown of the Brazilian economy that was already beginning in 2013. 
Oreiro  (2015)  points  out  that,  from  2008,  primary  federal  spending  increased  considerably, 
providing  a  highly  expansionary  fiscal  policy.  A  modest  primary  surplus  was  able  to  maintain  a  stable  
debt-to-GDP ratio with a slight downward trend until the 2013, when the Gross Government Debt-to-GDP 
ratio reached the level of 51.69%, as can be seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of the general government debt as a proportion of GDP in Gross and 
net  terms.  It is possible to see a downward trend  in  the period 2008-2013, except  for the one-off effect 
resulting from the international financial crisis in 2009. However, from 2014, the trajectory moves upward 
with a considerable increase of the Gross Government Debt-to-GDP passing rapidly from about 51.69% to 
74%,  which  requires  of  the  public  sector  a  strong  contingency  of  investments  and  the  need  to  review 
exemptions and expansion of subsidized credit through BNDES. The pillars of the main economic policies 
of Brazil between 2010 and 2014 were based on government spending as a means of fostering public income 
policies.  In  the  Brazilian  economic  performance,  compared  with  the  major  world  economies  during  the 
crisis, there is a difference in the movements of the product, since the US economies, Eurozone and China, 
had sustained growth in the period, macroeconomic stability and no financial or economic crisis triggered. 
From an internal point of view, however, Paula and Pires (2017) pointed out that the  gross fixed capital 
formation was the main factor that contributed to the slowdown of the Brazilian economy in 2011, precisely 
in the context of the New Economic Matrix. 

It is possible to identify biases in the national economic policy that aggravated the economic crisis, 
an increase in public spending and the change in the nominal result of the public sector, from -3% in 2013 
to -10.30% in 2016, according to data obtained from the National Treasury. Note that the 2014-2016 crisis 
of the Brazilian economy originated from shocks on both the supply and the demand side, and, as pointed 
out  by  Barbosa  Filho  (2017),  was  mostly  caused  by  policies  that  reduced  the  growth  capacity  of  the 
economy Brazilian and generated a high fiscal cost. The growth rate of Brazilian GDP has fallen from an 
average of 4% per year to less than 2% per year. At the same time, the Brazilian public sector showed a 
surplus primary of 2.2% in 2012 and generated a primary deficit of 2.7% in 2016. 

Marconi (2017) pointed out that "the imbalances of macroeconomic prices and the absence of public 
investments"  as  preponderant  factors  for  the  economic  crisis  (Marconi,  2017,  p.107).  Macroeconomic 
prices, in the context of the new developmentalism theory, are the following: exchange rate, interest rate, 
wages, inflation and profits. For the author, the binomial high interest rates and overvalued exchange rate 
impede the development of the Brazilian economy. It is the same view approached and defended in Marconi 
and Brancher (2017).  

Lack of capacity government financial raised the reduction of several investments in the Brazilian 
economy from 2015, especially the reduction of public spending. Therefore, it generated a fiscal crisis that 
systematically raised the country risk, the interest rate and, consequently, the uncertainty of the markets, 
substantially  reducing  consumption  and  investment  in  2015  and  2016,  which  also  contributed  to  the 
recession, including due to loss the credibility of the Central Bank of Brazil, the price adjustment and how 
monetary policy was conducted, which had to greatly accelerate the upward cycle to reenter the rate set by 
the  National  Monetary  Council.  Barbosa  Filho  (2017)  noted  that  in  2012,  there  was  a  reduction  in  the

interest  rate  of  the  economy  in  the  inflation  acceleration  scenario  in  the  context  of  the  New  Economic 
Matrix. Barbosa, Camêlo and João (2016) estimated the real interest rate of the Brazilian economy and a 
Taylor Rule, in order to assess whether there may have been some change in the behavior of the Central 
Bank of Brazil. The study found evidence that, from 2011, the Central Bank of Brazil became more lenient 
with respect to inflation. 

In  parallel  with  the  fiscal  and  monetary  issues,  as  regards  the  external  sector,  the  movement  of 
exports and imports in billions of dollars from 2011 to 2017 can be observed in Figure 3. Note that there is 
a drop in exports between 2011 and 2016, combined with increased imports in the period 2011 to 2014, 
which meant that, as in 2013, the trade surplus was less than R $1 billion, with a deficit of R $6.6 billion in 
2014. The dynamics of the global economy, slowdown in growth in emerging countries and low European 
economic  growth,  coupled with  the fall in  commodity prices and the  appreciation  of the  Real, were the 
main determinants of this behavior. With the decline in the Brazilian GDP, the recession scenario in 2015 
and the effects of the currency devaluation caused by the crisis, imports dropped sharply and exports started 
to grow, even if slowly, recovering positive trade balances.

Figure 3 therefore shows an imbalance in Brazil’s balance precisely in the time of the economic 
crisis in 2014, when the balance was negative at $6.6 billion. In later years, there was a surplus in the trade 
balance, as in 2015, the positive balance was already US $17.7 billion and, in 2017, reached US $64 billion. 
Therefore, it is  important to  highlight the role of the trade balance of countries, mainly in exports, as  a 
component of long-term effective demand trend. The trade balance also has an important role in addressing 
the external funding needed for the development and economic growth. 

Already Figure 4 shows the real growth of US GDP. It is possible to see an upward trend in the 
2011-2015 period, averaging 2.2% per year and the peak of 2.9% in 2015. The US, as the largest economy 
in  the  world,  has  an  influence  on  all  other  countries,  according  to  the  dependence  and  strength  of  the 
economy in question. Historically it is possible to see a direct relationship of international economic crises, 
especially  in  1929  and  2008  with  respect  to  the  contagion  of  major  economic  powers  and  its  effects  in 
developing countries. 

In this context, Figure 4 shows a period of economic boom, with growth of US GDP, between 2013 
and 2016, coinciding with the period when Brazil faced one of the worst crises in its history. The interest 
rate can also be considered a barometer for the flow of capital. Thus, it appears that there was an increase 
in US interest rates in the period, which would justify an increase in the flow of financial capital of much 
of the world  (not only in Brazil) to  the US.  You can see also  that  the rise in  US  interest  rates caused  a 
slowdown in the growth trajectory of the US economy.

When analyzing the GDP of countries, the most obvious mechanism to use is the ratio of exports of 
the  country  and  world  income,  and  the  multiplier  with  external  repercussions  naturally  expresses  this 
interdependence  between  macroeconomic  aggregates  two  countries.  According  to  Gordon  (2005),  the 
international economic crisis may give rise to protectionist pressures worldwide and start a trade war. Even 
in the commercial sphere, global crises tend to promote competition in the world market via a currency war 
(climbing  exchange  rate  devaluations).  Countries  with  a  high  degree  of  export  specialization  in 
commodities  are  more  susceptible  to  international  economic  instability,  due  to  the  inconsistency  of  the 
terms of trade resulting from trade and currency wars, and in this sense, when analyzing the evolution of 
US GDP, there is no direct relationship with the Brazilian economic crisis.

By analyzing Figure 5, it is found that, in 2015, the basic Brazilian interest rate, Selic, reached its 
highest level since 2011, with a level of 14.3% per year and, from 2016, begins its trajectory decreasing 
until, in 2017, the lowest in recent years, from 7.0% a year. The increase in interest rates reflects the need 
to control inflation, which distanced itself from the target set by the CMN, and adjust monetary policy in 
the face of capital flight due to the increase in US interest rates and essentially the increasingly discredited 
international community in relation to domestic economic policies. 2014 to 2016 inflation pressures begin 
to  slow  down  the  increase  in  unemployment  and,  consequently,  a  significant  reduction  in  household 
consumption.

4. Methodology  
 

In  order  to  evaluate  whether  the  Brazilian  economic  crisis  originated  from  external  or  internal 
determinants, the research methodology of this study is to conduct Granger precedence tests to evaluate the 
variables that affected (or not) the Brazilian economic performance. According to the theory presented in 
Granger  (1969),  if  a  certain  variable  X  causes  another  variable  Z,  then  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  that 
variations in X are previous to variations in Z. This means that the variable X helps predict future values 
of Z for some time horizon. The completion of the test requires initially that the series used are stationary. 
Once the stationary series is completed, then the lag selection tests are conducted. Initial discussions took 
place on the selection of lags, in view of Maddala and Lahiri (1992), who indicated that the lag-scale process 
was  in  some  sense  arbitrary.  This  is  because  there  are  a  variety  of  alternative  methods  to  available 
todetermine the optimal  size of  gaps in a model. The development  of more recent  research  allowed the 
improvement of the tests used to check lags without arbitrariness. In this sense, Davidson and MacKinnon 
(1993) suggest trying to identify the number of lags in the first place and only then make up the causality 
tests. The authors argue that the choice of a large number of lags would be preferable, since it would check 
how the exclusion of some lags affect the outcome of the estimates. On the one hand, the choice of a few 
gaps can cause serious bias due to the omission of relevant variables. On the other hand, choosing more 
gaps than necessary can lead to bias inclusion of irrelevant variables. In fact, this is the modeling method 
originally proposed by Hendry (1980), which suggests that the choice of the best model should be done 
gradually, starting with a very general model, and from several tests, narrowing the scope of the model in 
the final analysis. 

To  solve  the  issue  related  to  the  optimal  choice  of  lags,  we  will  initially  estimate  a  model  of 
Autoregressive Vectors (VAR) with respective tests for lag selection in the template context. The use of 
Autoregressive  Vectors  models  is  widespread  in  economics  and  research,  and,  according  to  Cavalcanti 
(2010),  they  are  among  the  instruments  most  commonly  used  in  empirical  research  in  the  area  of 
macroeconomics. VAR models, largely, are popular because of the perception that they allow the analysis 
of the interrelationships between multiple variables from a minimum set of identification restrictions, i.e. 
restrictions  to  identify  the  “exogenous”  component  of  each  variable,  making  it  possible  to  estimate  the 
effect of a “shock” of this variable on the other. In the context of this study, the estimate of the VAR was 
used solely to determine the appropriate number of lags precedence to statistical tests. We will therefore 
estimate VAR models for each pair of stationary variables in order to identify the ideal number of lags for 
the statistical precedence test. 

In this context there will will be five tests / criteria applied for selecting the best model: Statistical 
test, sequential LR modified with each error at 5% significance level, the final prediction error test, Criteria 
of Akaike, Schwarz Criteria and Criteria of Hannan-Quinn. The tests are discussed in detail by Lütkepohl 
(2005). The tests will be realized with stationary variables in the context of a VAR model with estimates 
that choose from 1 to 5 lags. 

The variables used in the survey were collected on a quarterly basis starting in the 1st quarter of 
2008 to the 4th quarter of 2017 and are as follows: i) real growth rate of Brazilian GDP, represented by the 
acronym GDP_BR, which shows the quarterly change in national production and is the main variable of 
this study, given that all the other variables of the research were analyzed in relation to the Brazilian GDP, 
whereas the goal is to assess whether there is (or not) statistical precedence of other variables in relation to 
the behavior of Brazilian economy. The data source of this variable is the IBGE. ii) the US GDP growth 
rate, represented by the acronym, GDP_US, which represents the quarterly variation in production of the 
world’s leading economy, which usually impacts the economies of other countries. The source of this series 
is  the  Bureau  of  Economic  Analysis.  iii)  the  European  Union’s  GDP  growth  rate,  represented  by  the 
acronym, GDP_UE, which represents the quarterly variation in production of the countries of the Eurozone, 
whose source of data is Eurostat. iv) the global GDP growth rate, represented by the acronym, GDP_W, 
which represents the quarterly variation of world production and was obtained in Bloomberg. v) US interest 
rates, represented by the prime interest rate, obtained on the basis of Bloomberg and represented by IR_US. 
vi)  price  of  iron  ore  at  $  considering  that  Brazil  is  a  major  exporter  of  this  commodity,  represented  by

IronOre_P  variable  obtained  on  the  basis  of  Bloomberg.  vii)  Price  of  Brent  crude  oil  barrel  in  dollars 
represented by OIL_P obtained on the basis of Bloomberg. viii) price index US consumer, represented by 
P_US  also  obtained  on  the  basis  of  Bloomberg.  ix)  Exchange  Rate  R  $  /  US  $,  represented  by  ER  and 
obtained  the  Central  Bank  of  Brazil.  The  rate  refers  to  the  purchase  price  of  end  of  period.  x)  Brazil’s 
exports  in  dollars,  accumulated  in  the  last  12  months,  obtained  from  the  Central  Bank  of  Brazil  and 
represented by X and xi) Brazil’s imports from the rest of the world in dollars, accumulated in the last 12 
months, represented by M and also obtained by the Central Bank of Brazil. xii) Current account as a share 
of GDP represented and obtained by the Central Bank of Brazil and represented by X and xiii) Net debt of 
the public sector as a proportion of GDP, which clears the stock of debt in proportion to the product of the 
country, represented by DEBT_GDP obtained in Macrodados. xiv) Selic-over, which is the basic interest 
rate  of  the  Brazilian  economy,  represented  by  IR_BR.  The  rate  shown  is  sourced  from  site  of  Brazil’s 
Central Bank and was accumulated in the quarter. xv) Gross Fixed Capital Formation, expressed in terms 
of real quarterly growth, which represents the investment of the private sector of the economy, the IBGE 
obtained and represented by GFCF.

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of the variables. You can see that the average growth of the 
quarterly product of Brazil and the USA over that period, is very close to zero. The average per quarter of 
global growth was 3.2% in the period. The US interest rate had a very close minimum value of zero as a 
result of its expansionist policy after the financial crisis of subprime. 

It is of note that both the price of iron ore and oil fluctuated significantly in the period. The price of 
iron  ore  had  an  even  bigger  swing,  with  a  minimum  value  of  $38.49  and  maximum  of  $177.23.  The 
relationship between the real (R $) and the US dollar (US $) more than doubled between the minimum and 
maximum values, and, thus, large amplitude. The behavior of the variables can be seen in Figure 6. You 
can see that, especially at the beginning of the period, in 2008 and 2009, the variables related to production 
(GDP of Brazil, the United States, Europe and the World), the US interest rates, the level of prices and 
commodity prices (iron ore and oil) showed high oscillation.

To evaluate the stationarity of the series used for the estimate, which is a necessary procedure prior 
to  performing  the  tests  of  precedence,  there  will  be  the  root  test  unit  Dickey-Fuller  and  /  or  increased 
Dickey-Fuller (ADF) as Dickey and Fuller (1979). The number of lags for carrying out the ADF test was 
selected according to the best criterion offered by Schwarz, and additionally by the choice of the number 
of lags required to remove any residues of serial correlation. The test results can be observed in Table 2 and

(with or without constant and with or without bias). As can be seen in Table 2, it was possible to reject the

was adopted, which was adopted in two different ways.

For series that were not expressed in the percentage form, the log difference was applied, showing 
what  happened  to  the  iron  ore  price  series  (IRON_P),  with  oil  prices  (OIL_P),  exchange  rate  (ER)  and 
Exports (X). As for the variables Current Account balance to GDP and net public sector debt to GDP ratio, 
already expressed in the form of rate and proved non-stationary as the ADF test, was only applied to first 
difference for the series become stationary. In order to addresse the issue of non-stationarity of the series 
with the differentiation process, we proceeded to the choice of the best model in terms of the number of 
lags. 

As mentioned above, five tests were applied / criteria for selection of the ideal number of lags for 
carrying out the test precedence. In the estimation context of a VAR model bivariate with one of variables 
must be the Brazilian GDP, they were five tests conducted, whose results were presented in Table 3: LR, 
which is the statistical test modified sequential LR, the prediction error test end (FPE), Akaike (AIC), the 
Schwarz criterion (SC), and finally the criterion of Hannan-Quinn (HQ).

Therefore,  five  criteria  were  applied  in  each  of  the  15  estimates  of  the  variables  that  may  have 
preceded the Brazilian GDP. As can be seen in Table 3, in some cases, such as the pair GDP of Brazil and 
GDP in the euro zone, all of the criteria pointed  to one lag as the best option. This also occurred in the 
analysis of the Brazilian GDP to US prices, the exchange rate and exports, among other variables. In other 
cases, three or four criteria were identified as the optimal number of lags. Four criteria showed the optimal 
number of 3 lags for the joint analysis of Brazil’s GDP and the US and the optimal number of 4 lags between 
the GDP of Brazil and Brazilian imports from the rest of the world. The ratio between the Brazilian product 
and  the  world  was  reported  by  three  criteria  with  the  number  of  lags  equal  to  3  as  the  ideal.  This  also 
occurred with other variables, such as US interest rates, oil prices and iron ore, among others. 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
 

From transformation of non-stationary series in stationary with logarithmic difference or only with 
the application of difference to series that were already expressed in percentage and the definition of the 
optimal  number  of  lags  from  different  lag  length  selection  criteria,  the  Granger  precedence  test  was 
performed in order to identify whether internal or external command variable preceded Brazil’s GDP. 

According to what was presented in the methodology, the series has quarterly variables, beginning in 
the 1st quarter of 2008 to the 4th quarter of 2017 and, for all selected variables, the causality test was applied 
in the sense of Granger, regarding the Brazilian GDP. Table 4 shows the test results. The test has as null 
hypothesis, the fact that X does not cause, in the Granger sense, the variable Z. In this sense, the first column 
of the table shows the variables that were tested for precedence over the country’s GDP. Following, there 
is the number of observations used in the estimate, which ranged in front of the number of lags selected by 
the criteria and the fact that the original series or not stationary. The last two columns present the F-statistic 
and the p-value, respectively. 

As can be seen from Table 4, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the US GDP does not cause, 
in the Granger sense, Brazilian GDP. In other words, there is no evidence of precedence of US product on 
the  Brazilian  situation  during  the  period.  The  same  goes  for  the  product  in  the  euro  zone,  where  the  
F-statistic also does not allow rejection of the null hypothesis. In the case of global GDP, however, the null 
hypothesis can be rejected, which means that there are indications that global GDP has preceded,  in the 
Granger sense, the Brazilian GDP. Another variable that the test indicated as a precedent in relation to the 

 

14 

 
Brazilian GDP was the US interest rate, which suggests that the end of the Quantitative Easing period and 
the reversal of the monetary policy by the Fed impacted the Brazilian GDP.

With respect to commodity prices, especially with regard to oil and iron ore prices, you can see that 
it was possible to reject the null hypothesis that the two commodities prices do not cause, in the sense of 
Granger, the Brazilian GDP. Thus, it is emphasized that both the price of oil and iron ore proved precedent 
in relation to the Brazilian production. 

With regard to the US price level, the test results indicate that it is not possible to reject the null 
hypothesis of no causality, indicating therefore that US inflation had no effect on the Brazilian product. As 
for  the  exchange  rate  R  $  /  US  $  the  result  is  different.  The  exchange  rate  preceded  it,  in  the  sense  of 
Granger,  Brazil’s  GDP.  The  exchange  rate  includes  both  internal  and  external  determinants.  In  internal 
terms, a more expansionary monetary policy than that established by the Taylor  Rule may cause capital 
flight  and  further  devaluation,  as  in  the  context  of  the  New  Economic  Matrix  presented  previously.  In 
external terms, the end of Quantitative Easing program promoted capital inflows from emerging countries 
to the developed economies or, more specifically, to the US. 

For exports, the test  suggests no precedence between exports and  Brazil’s GDP. As for imports, 
even at the 5% significance level it is not possible to reject the null hypothesis, one can consider import 
precedence for the Brazilian GDP at a 10% significance level, which suggests that the growth of imports 
checked in the period before the crisis is one of the determinants of Brazilian GDP. 

Regarding the current account deficit as a proportion of GDP and, in addition, public debt to GDP, 
we can not reject the null hypothesis. In other words, it can be considered that the variables did not precede, 
in the Granger sense, the Brazilian GDP. This may be because the current account deficit has shown mild 
improvement  with  relative  stability  after  2010  until  2014.  With  regard  to  public  debt,  the  deterioration 
occurred from 2015, after the start of the crisis, which may have contributed to the result of the Granger 
test. 

In  terms  of  domestic  monetary  policy,  we  can  see  that  the  Brazilian  interest  rate  preceded  the 
Brazilian GDP, since it is possible to note that the null hypothesis can be rejected at a 1% significance level, 
which  means  that  monetary  policy,  now  expansionary,  now  contractionary,  was  responsible  for  the 
Brazilian  GDP  behavior,  especially  after  the  minimum  of  7.25%  floor  kept  for  a  period  than  needed 
according to analysis based on the Taylor Rule, among others, that made the cycle high more intense, with 
the interest rate reaching the level of 14.25%. 

15 

 

 
Finally, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation, which is an internal nature variable, and capturing in 
advance any imbalances between aggregate supply and demand in the economy, as well as to relate to the 
expectations of the business sector, not preceded GDP, in the Granger sense, at the 5% of significance level, 
but at the 10% significance level it was possible to reject the null hypothesis of no causality in the Granger 
sense.  It  is  possible  to  infer,  therefore,  that  there  is  precedence  of  GFCF  for  the  Brazilian  GDP.  These 
results go against those identified by Paula and Pires (2017), which showed the gross fixed capital formation 
as an important determinant of the slowdown of the Brazilian economy. 

Based on the results of causality tests in the Granger sense, you can say that as the Brazilian product 
is preceded by both internal factors and by external factors, the Brazilian economic crisis of 2014 to 2016 
was preceded not only the conduct of domestic macroeconomic policy and domestic variables, but also by 
the international environment variables. The domestic point of view, the basic interest rate of the economy, 
the exchange rate, Brazilian imports from the rest of the world and gross fixed capital formation preceded 
the Brazilian GDP. From the international point of view, commodity prices, such as oil and iron ore, the 
US interest rates and global GDP also showed precedent. The R $ / US $ exchange rate, which, to a certain 
extent, reflects both internal and external factors, also cannot be ignored. According to Gala and Araújo 
(2011),  the  devalued  exchange  rate  increases  domestic  savings  and  generates  investment  opportunities, 
increasing economic growth. As the pre-crisis period was marked by currency overvaluation, it is possible 
to point out the imbalance of the exchange rate as one of the important determinants of the crisis, as the 
new developmentalism pointed out. 
 
The methodology used in the study does not allow us to quantify the relative share of internal and / 
or external factors in the Brazilian crisis, but the results are close and they complete the analyses presented 
in studies with similar objectives. Balassiano (2018), for example, found that the rate of investment to GDP 
had a steeper fall than it should, according to the method of synthetic control, even with the limitations 
already mentioned the use of the Chilean economy as placebo research. Thus, in the view of Balassiano 
(2018), it is most likely that internal determinants were responsible for the crisis. 
 
The current survey also found results observed in studies with the opposite view, showing that the 
determinants of the crisis were predominantly internal in nature. Borges (2017) pointed out that the collapse 
of oil prices in the international market from 2014, in addition to issues related to corruption that influenced 
sovereign risk before the possible need for financial support to possible state of insolvency of Petrobras, 
were  important  determinants  of  the  Brazilian  crisis.  It  is  clear  to  say  that  Borges  (2017)  also  finds 
responsible domestic economic policies, especially fiscal, as causes of the crisis, in addition to the policy 
and  governance  crisis  that  marked  the  year  2014.  However,  the  point  made  by  the  author  is  that  the 
international  nature  of  factors  was  dominant.  Another  highlight  from  the  international  perspective, 
according  to  the  author,  is  that,  after  a  boom  in  commodity  prices,  the  exchange  rates  of  commodity-
exporting countries tend to appreciate, which causes sectoral allocative changes in the economy, from the 
tradables  sector  to  the  non-tradables,  which  has  lower  average  productivity,  constituting  an  additional 
determining factor for the crisis of 2014-2016. 
 
6. Concluding Remarks 
 

The Brazilian economy faced one of the worst recessions in history, which began in 2014 and had 
a total duration of 11 quarters, equaling in duration and approaching in intensity, the scenario experienced 
in  the early 1980s. Changes in  the  conduct  of domestic macroeconomic policy and the exchange  of the 
Macroeconomic Tripod for New Economic Matrix were identified by many authors as the main cause of 
the recessive scenario that Brazil experienced. At the same time, there were changes in the international 
scenario, with falling prices of major commodities, the end of the monetary stimulus program by the Federal 
Reserve and changes in the growth dynamics of the world economy, slowing growth in many emerging 
countries.  The  unfavorable  international  scenario  was  pointed  out  by  the  official  discourse  of  the 
government and the defenders in the New Economic Matrix as the main cause of the crisis, exempting the 
excess  of  interventionism  in  the  economy  through  excess  of  expenses  and  maintenance  of  interest  in 
excessively low levels with expansion of credit as main determinants.

In this context,  this study  aimed to  assess whether determinants  of  an internal  or external  nature 
precede  the  Brazilian  GDP  and  thus  evaluate  the  main  causes  of  the  Brazilian  economic  crisis,  so  it  is 
possible to anticipate, prevent and mitigate future crises of this nature. Based on the theoretical framework 
and the econometric methodology used, it can be said that the combination of internal and external elements 
resulted in the recessionary environment of 2014 to 2016. It is noteworthy, then, that there is evidence that 
the Brazilian economic crisis was caused by both the international and national scene. 

 The  impacts  of  economic  crises  can  be  distinguished  according  to  the  characteristics  of  each 
country, with their dependence on the international market, their level of indebtedness and macroeconomic 
policies adopted, among other things. In Brazil, changes in the conduct of monetary and fiscal policies were 
important determinants of the recession, since the reversion of monetary and fiscal expansion causes, of 
course, fall in aggregate demand and output, at least in the short term. 

Based on the results of causality tests in the Granger sense, you can say that as the Brazilian product 
was preceded by both internal factors and by external factors, the Brazilian economic crisis of 2014 to 2016 
was  caused  not  only  by  conduction  of  domestic  macroeconomic  policy  and  the  behavior  of  domestic 
variables, such as variables of the international economic situation. The domestic point of view, the basic 
rate of interest of the economy, the exchange rate, Brazilian imports from the rest of the world and gross 
fixed  capital  formation  preceded  the  Brazilian  GDP.  From  the  international  point  of  view,  commodity 
prices, such as oil and iron ore, the US interest rates and global GDP  are shown as preceding the Gross 
Domestic Product of Brazil. The precedence of the R $ / US $ exchange rate, which in a way reflects both 
internal and external factors, cannot be overemphasized. The methodology used in the study does not allow 
us to quantify the relative share of internal and / or external factors in the Brazilian crisis, but the results 
are  close  and  complete  the  analyses  presented  in  studies  with  similar  objectives,  as  presented  over  the 
course of the article. There was then convergence of this research with studies that indicate internal factors 
as being responsible for the crisis. At the same time, there is an approximation of the results of Granger 
causality tests with variables of the international scene. In addition, research has importantly contributed to 
the  pointing  out  of  the  presence  of  both  domestic  factors  and  international  ones    in  the  Brazilian  GDP 
behavior, and hence in recent Brazilian economic crisis. 

The research shows, however, some limitations. In addition to the inability to numerically quantify 
the combined effect of internal determinants and the combined effect of external factors on the proportion 
of the responsibility for the crisis, not all possible interference variables were incorporated into precedence 
tests.  We’re  not  included  in  the  domestic  perspective,  expectations  of  variables  both  consumers  and 
producers, as well as the effects of corruption, just as an example. From the international perspective, the 
behavior of emerging countries was also not properly captured in the variables used in the research. Other 
methods, in addition to those used in this study and in other studies included in the literature review, could 
be applied. 

Thus, it may be relevant to apply cointegration tests between relevant variables and the Brazilian 
GDP in order to identify the presence of a long-term relationship between the variables. Another possibility 
relates to the application of an autoregressive vector (VAR) model or a model of autoregressive vector error 
correction (VEC).  In such cases it would be possible to  analyze the variance decomposition  of  forecast 
errors  in  order  to  try  to  estimate  the  relative  contribution  of  each  of  the  internal  or  external  nature  of 
variables  in  determining  the  GDP  and  hence  the  responsibility  of  domestic  policies  or  the  international 
scene  in  terms  of  relative  share.  Given  the  importance  of  the  issue  and  the  possibilities  of  a  wealth  of 
understanding  of  the  issues  raised,  such  possibilities  should  be  included  as  relevant  topics  in  the  future 
research agenda.
