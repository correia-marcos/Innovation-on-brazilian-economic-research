Abstract

In this work we develop an agent-based model where hysteresis in major macroeconomic vari-
ables (e.g., GDP, productivity, unemployment) emerges out of the decentralized interactions of
heterogeneous ﬁrms and workers. Building upon the model in Dosi et al. (2016, 2017), we spec-
ify an endogenous process of accumulation of workers’ skills and a state-dependent process of
ﬁrms entry, studying their hysteretic impacts. Indeed, hysteresis is ubiquitous. However, this is
not due to market imperfections, but rather to the very functioning of decentralised economies
characterised by coordination externalities and dynamic increasing returns. So, contrary to the
insider-outsider hypothesis (Blanchard and Summers, 1986), the model does not support the
ﬁndings that rigid industrial relations may foster hysteretic behaviour in aggregate unemploy-
ment. On the contrary, this contribution provides evidence that during severe downturns, and
thus declining aggregate demand, phenomena like decreasing investment and innovation rates,
skills deterioration, and declining entry dynamics are better candidates to explain long-run un-
employment spells and reduced output growth.
In that, more rigid labour markets dampen
hysteretic dynamics by supporting aggregate demand, thus making the economy more resilient.

1 Introduction

In this work, we develop an agent-based model able to display the endogenous emergence of hysteresis
out of the interaction of heterogeneous ﬁrms and workers. The paper focuses on both the causes
and the consequences of the hysteretical properties of macroeconomic time series, including GDP,
productivity, and unemployment. Further, reﬁning upon Dosi et al. (2016, 2017), we introduce an
endogenous process of accumulation of workers’ skills, and a state-dependent process of ﬁrms entry,
studying their hysteretic eﬀects.

As we shall brieﬂy discuss below, there are diﬀerent notions of hysteresis. Basically, they boil
down to three diﬀerent interpretations of the phenomenon (more in Piscitelli et al., 2000, Hallett
and Piscitelli, 2002, Amable et al., 2004). The ﬁrst is formulated in terms of the persistence in
the deviations from some equilibrium path; the second is deﬁned as a random-walk dynamics in
equilibrium itself; the third, we believe a more genuine one, is in terms of the heterogeneous and non-
linear responses of a system characterised by multiple equilibria or path-dependent trajectories. Even
if Piscitelli et al. (2000) (p. 59-60) deﬁne the former two as bastard usages of the notion of hysteresis,
they have been the most common in economics, at least. In a representative example, Blanchard and
Summers (1986) famous paper used the second of the foregoing interpretations in attempt to explain
the structural unemployment in the late 1980’s in many European countries, at around 10% and
quite far from the predicted 2-3% equilibrium level. Two alternative hypotheses were proposed by
these authors in order to explain the emergence of hysteresis, a ﬁrst one resting on the membership
channel according to which only insider workers are able to exert pressure in the wage setting process,
and a second one based on the duration channel, because the long-term unemployed are less relevant
in the wage determination process.
In the latter case, unemployment duration can (a) induce a
process of worker skills deterioration, implying that the long-term unemployed experiences a fall in
their productivity; (b) trigger search discouragement in unemployed people, less re-employable, and
so less prone to search in the labour market.

Together with the supply side channels emphasized from the eighties, some acknowledgement has
gone to aggregate demand shocks conceived as potential sources of hysteresis in the current economic
crisis. Therefore, the notion of hysteresis has been extended from unemployment to permanent
output loss. Blanchard et al. (2015) revisit hysteresis as the permanent eﬀect exerted by crises on
the the levels of output relative to the pre-crises one. The work suggests a sustained output gap in
69% of the cases, among 22 countries in the period 1960-2010, where in 47% of them the recession
was followed by an increasing output gap, meaning that recessionary periods aﬀected not only the
levels but also the subsequent growth rates, an eﬀect named by Ball (2014) as super-hysteresis. In
fact, Ball (2014) reports that over 23 countries in the period 2007-2014, most of them have been hit
by severe recession, and some of them, like Greece, faced up to 30% losses in potential output.

The empirical detection of hysteresis, of course, goes together with the analysis of its determi-
nants. Agent-based models (Tesfatsion and Judd, 2006; LeBaron and Tesfatsion, 2008) are particu-
larly suitable to the task as one knows by construction the micro data-generating process and thus
can explore the possible hysteretic features of aggregate variables as emergent properties of the evo-
lutionary dynamics.1 The model, built upon the “Keynes meets Schumpeter” family of models (Dosi
et al., 2010, Napoletano et al., 2012, Dosi et al., 2013, Dosi et al., 2015, 2016, 2017), as we shall see,
is able to generically yield hysteresis in the macro variables under scrutiny both inter-regimes and
intra-regimes. Indeed, hysteresis is ubiquitous.

According to our analysis, hysteresis is not due to market imperfections but rather to the very
functioning of decentralised economies characterised by coordination externalities and dynamic in-
creasing returns. Contrary to what is suggested by Blanchard and Summers (1986), our model does

not support the hypothesis that rigid industrial relations, via the insider-outsider channel, are the
driving source of hysteresis in aggregate unemployment. On the contrary, more in line with Ball
et al. (2014), our work indicates that during severe downturns and thus declining aggregate demand,
phenomena like decreasing investment and innovation rates, skills deterioration, and declining en-
try dynamics are better candidates to explain long term unemployment spells and reduced output
growth. In such a framework, more rigid labour markets, by supporting aggregate demand, do not
foster hysteresis but rather dampen it, thus making the economy more resilient.

The paper is organised as follows. After this introduction, Section 2 discusses the nature and
the sources of hysteresis. In Section 3, we present the model structure. The empirical regularities
matched by the K+S model are discussed in Section 4. In Section 5, we study the emergence and
the causes of hysteresis. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

2 The nature and determinants of hysteresis

In this section, we provide a brief exploration on the sources and potential channels which might
induce hysteretic behaviours in the macroeconomic variables. Hysteresis, a concept adopted from the
natural sciences but with similar instances in economics, is a nonlinear mechanism, often implying
multiple (alternative) time trajectories and equilibria.
In a very broad perspective, a dynamical
system can be considered hysteretical when the time trajectories of some or all of its variables do
exhibit path-dependency, in turn also implying in non-ergodicity. The very notion of multiple paths
for the development of both socio-economic and natural complex systems ultimately rests on the idea
that history is an essential part of the interpretation of many dynamic phenomena. The property
that history matters is also intimately related to that of time irreversibility, that is, a situation where
it is not possible, even theoretically, to “reverse the arrow of time” and still expect to recover invariant
properties of the system under investigation.

However, in tackling path-dependent phenomena in the social sciences, an intrinsic diﬃculty rests
also in the fact that frequently only one of the many possible realizations of the system, dependent
on its initial state, is empirically observed.
In fact, is history-dependence only shaped by initial
conditions or does it relate also to irreversible eﬀects of some particular unfolding events (e.g., crises
or regime changes)? Related, how do the set of all possible evolutionary paths are shaped and
constrained by the structure inherited from the past?

In economics, the very notion of hysteresis has only been acknowledged with some scepticism
and often in the most restrictive interpretations. In the 1980’s and 1990’s, a stream of literature has
faced head-on the challenge of non-linearity of growth processes and thus the multiplicity of alter-
native paths and the related hysteretic properties (good examples are the contributions in Anderson
et al., 1988 and Day and Chen, 1993).2 However, such a stream of investigation was progressively
marginalized, possibly due to its “revolutionary” theoretical implications, particularly in terms of
equilibria selection and the welfare theorems. A usual “safer” path has been that of formalizing the
phenomenon based on linear stochastic models with close-to-unit-root auto-regressive processes. In
their seminal contribution, Blanchard and Summers (1986) identify hysteresis in the unemployment
series whenever the coeﬃcient of persistence ρ in the equation Ut = ρUt−1 + αt + t + θt−1 was
estimated to be greater or equal to one.

Whether or not a (close to) unit-root process is an adequate signal of hysteresis has been strongly
debated. Recently, Gal´ı (2015) explores, without conclusive results, three alternative sources to a
unit-root process of the European unemployment rate, testing whether it lies (i) in the natural rate
of unemployment (U n
t ), or
(iii) in the insider-outsider hypothesis (`a la Blanchard-Summers) via alternative speciﬁcations for

t−1 + t), (ii) in the central bank inﬂation target (π∗

t−1 + ∗

t = π∗

t = U n

1991, 1993.

the New Keynesian Wage Phillips Curve. In general, this modelling approach has been based on a
somewhat naive epistemology – like “Which processes should present unit-roots? The natural rate
of unemployment, the inﬂation target, or the wage setting curve?” –, but without jeopardizing the
underlying unique equilibrium assumption. The obvious dissatisfaction with the (linear) unit-root
process approach is currently bringing a revival on the importance of the detection of nonlinearities in
empirical macroeconomics, therefore questioning the widespread use of such methods. For example,
Beaudry et al. (2016) do ﬁnd evidence of cyclical recurrent patterns, not detectable when estimating
auto-regressive linear stochastic models, while examining empirical time series like unemployment
and working hours.

However, the critique to the unit-root process approach is deeper and concerns its very underlying
theory: as suggested by Piscitelli et al. (2000), Hallett and Piscitelli (2002), Amable et al. (2004) and
Bassi and Lang (2016), genuine models of hysteresis should embed a nonlinear structure – or at least
do not discard nonlinearity in advance. According to Piscitelli et al. (2000), three features characterise
hysteretic processes, namely, non-linearity, selectivity, and remanence. Being this memory process
nonlinear, reversing a shock may not drive the system to recover its starting point. Moreover,
selectivity means that not all shocks aﬀect the system in the same way in diﬀerent circumstances.
Finally, remanence entails that temporary or non-recurrent shocks may lead to permanent new system
states.

Widespread origins of hysteresis in the socio-economic domain are, ﬁrst, feedback mechanisms
related to coordination externalities, and, second, ampliﬁcation processes stemming from some form
of increasing returns.3 In particular, it is frequently derived from (i) positive feedbacks between levels
of aggregate activities and innovative search, and (ii) powerful interactions between the aggregate
demand and the diﬀusion of innovations. Whenever one abandons the unfortunate idea that the
macroeconomic system is held up to some mysteriously stable and unique equilibrium path, it could
well be that negative demand shocks exert persistent eﬀects, because less aggregate demand entails less
innovative search, which in turn entails less innovation stemming from technological shocks (Stiglitz,
1994).

Despite the 2008 crisis, many economists continue to believe in some version of the model un-
derlying the example A in Figure 1: the economy is bound to “spring back”, with no permanent
loss to its long-run equilibrium rate of growth. The econometric side of this belief is the Frisch-like
idea of the economy as a “pendulum”, responding to exogenous shocks.4 In this perspective, it seems
almost a “miracle” that in the empirical literature one recently ﬁnds impulse response functions with
multipliers signiﬁcantly greater than one. This, we suggest, is a witness of the depth of the current
crisis (see Blanchard and Leigh, 2013).

However, a small but signiﬁcant minority of the profession has been forced by the evidence to
accept case B in Figure 1: recession-induced output losses are permanent because even if the system
goes back to the pre-crisis rate of growth, that is associated with an absolute level gap growing
exponentially over time. Moreover, as discussed in Stiglitz (1994), imperfect capital markets and
credit rationing may well exacerbate the eﬀects of recessions, hampering the recovery of the growth
rate even further. Beyond that, recurrent negative demand shocks, such as those deriving from
austerity or labour market ﬂexibilization policies, might yield reduced long-term rates of growth: this
is what is shown in Dosi et al. (2016) and Dosi et al. (2016). In the latter scenario, as in the example
C in Figure 1, the pre- and post-crisis growth trajectories diverge, implying a reduced long-run rate
of the output growth.

2.1 Innovation, diﬀusion and investment

At the empirical level, a ﬁrst microeconomic channel5 which might induce hysteresis is the lower
innovation rate associated with a reduction in the aggregate demand, which turns out in a decline
in the productivity growth. Indeed, R&D expenditures are pro-cyclical. Moreover, the diﬀusion of
new technologies and the adoption of capital-embodied, best-practice techniques slows down during
crises. Reifschneider et al. (2015) document a drop in the yearly rate of growth of R&D expenditure
in the U.S. from 3.6% during the pre-crises period (1990-2007), on average, to 1.6% after 2007. Not
only the propensity to innovate, but also the process of adoption and diﬀusion of innovation is slowed
down by the contraction of aggregate demand. Both phenomena have been emphasized long ago by
Freeman et al. (1982) in their search for the patterns and determinants of long term ﬂuctuations in
growth and employment, and, more recently, theoretically investigated in Dosi et al. (2016, 2017).

Together with the slower rates of innovation, a process of destruction of the installed productive
capacity, due to the lack of sales prospects, seems markedly happening in the post-2008. Indeed,
even non-Keynesian commentators have identiﬁed the current economic crisis as one stemming from
the lack of aggregate demand. As the interest rate reached its zero lower bound without fostering
any surge in the investment rate, only accelerator-type investment processes seem able to explain
the deteriorating dynamics of the productive capacity. Consistently with the accelerator hypothesis,
Kothari et al. (2013) report that investments are ultimately aﬀected by the dynamics of sales, rather
than by the interest rate. According to their estimates, of the 23% total drop in investment during
2008-2009, “more than three-quarters (18.1%) can be explained by the drop in GDP and corporate
proﬁts in the fourth quarter of 2008” [ibid, p. 6].

Overall, lower innovation, diﬀusion and investment rates seem very plausible candidates to explain
the current slowdown in productivity. In turn, the fundamental point is that such changes may well
bear a long-term impact, that is hysteretic eﬀects, on the future dynamics of productivity, GDP and
employment.

5The order the channels are presented is not relevant in terms of the impact produced by each one upon hysteresis.

2.2 Entry dynamics

The second microeconomic channel is the declining entry rate of ﬁrms in the market, which has
been recently investigated especially in the U.S., as discussed in Gourio et al. (2014). Entry rates
have declined since 2006 by about 27%, a widespread phenomenon across all sectors of the economy.
This has been accompanied by steady exit rates and, consequently, also shrinking net entry rates.
One direct eﬀect of less entry is the reduced creation of new job opportunities. Decker et al. (2016)
document a long term pattern in the declining business dynamism which the authors attribute,
mainly, to the contracting share of young ﬁrms.
In a similar vein, Siemer (2014) introduces the
hypothesis of a missing generation of entrants after the 2008 crisis, as the results of the tightening
ﬁnancial constraints, primarily aﬀecting young ﬁrms. According to his estimates, the more ﬁnance-
dependent entrant ﬁrms reduced their the rates of job creation between 4.8 and 10.5 percentage
points relative to the less ﬁnance-constrained incumbents. In fact, constrained access to credit may
represent an important barrier to entry, together with the usual set-up costs, particularly during
crises and the associated tight ﬁnance availability. In a Minskian perspective, on the other hand,
periods of easy access to debt may induce a higher entry rate. Kerr and Nanda (2009) studied the
eﬀect of the banking deregulation in the U.S. upon the entry rate from the 1970s and estimated
an increase of 10% in the start-ups rate after the reforms. Similar ﬁndings have been reported by
Bertrand et al. (2007) at the industry level for France.

All in all, both in relatively bad or good times, the entry dynamics, aﬀected by credit and other

conditions, seems to be a potentially relevant source of hysteresis.

2.3 Skills deterioration

A third microeconomic channel which might trigger hysteresis is the workers’ skills deterioration
process. Once the economy enters a longer recessionary phase, ﬁrms tend to ﬁre workers. During
severe recessions, like the 2008 ongoing crisis, the incentive to ﬁrms to hire is signiﬁcantly weakened,
so unemployment which could be in principle temporary and cyclical turns out to be persistent,
implying that many workers experience long unemployment periods. Unemployed workers, as they
stop learning-by-doing and lose contact with the new practices and techniques being introduced by
ﬁrms, gradually deteriorate their existing skills during the unemployment period. As the economy
recovers and the unemployed are ﬁnally hired, their productivity is lower than incumbent workers,
reducing the overall productivity.

Looking at the recent ﬁgures, Reifschneider et al. (2015) document that the share of workers
who have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks peaked at 45% in 2011 and it was still about
30% in 2013. On a similar vein, Jaimovich and Siu (2012) analyse the speed of economic recovery
during diﬀerent economic recessions (1970, 1975, 1982, 1991, 2001, 2009) in the United States. Their
ﬁndings suggest that while in the ﬁrst three recessions aggregate employment begun to expand
within six months of the peak of the downturn, during the last three crises employment continued
to contract for about 20 months before turning around. Yet, at the end of 2013 employment had
not returned to the pre-crisis level. Finally, Abraham et al. (2016) studying the eﬀect of long-
term unemployment on employment probability and earnings ﬁnd evidence that long unemployment
duration is negatively associated with both job-ﬁnding rates and earning opportunities. On a similar
vein, Ghayad (2013), based on a r´esum´e review study, reports that employers have a strong rejection
for long-term unemployed applicants, even in case of equivalent or superior r´esum´e qualiﬁcation.

Hence, the eﬀects of long unemployment shocks upon skills and job-ﬁnding probabilities are yet

another important candidate as a source of macroeconomic hysteresis.

3 The model

We build a general disequilibrium, stock-and-ﬂow consistent, agent-based model, populated by het-
erogeneous ﬁrms and workers who behave according to bounded-rational rules. More speciﬁcally, we
extend the Keynes Meets Schumpeter (K+S) model (Dosi et al., 2010) with decentralized interac-
tions among ﬁrms and workers in both the product and the labour markets (Dosi et al., 2016, 2017),
introducing an endogenous process of workers’ skills accumulation and variable number of ﬁrms in
the markets.

The two-sector economy in the model is composed of three populations of heterogeneous agents,
F 1
t consumption-good ﬁrms, LS consumers/workers, plus a bank and the
t capital-good ﬁrms, F 2
Government.6 Capital-good ﬁrms invest in R&D and produce heterogeneous machine-tools whose
productivity stochastically evolves over time. Consumption-good ﬁrms combine machines bought
from capital-good ﬁrms and labour in order to produce an homogeneous product for consumers.
There is a minimal ﬁnancial system represented by a single bank that provides credit to ﬁrms to
ﬁnance production and investment plans. Credit is allocated to each ﬁrm according to their own
demand, which is constrained by their past performance, according to a loan-to-sales cap rule ap-
plied by the bank. Conversely, credit supply is completely elastic, adapting to the approved credit
demand. Workers submit job applications to a small random subset of ﬁrms. Firms hire according
to their individual adaptive demand expectations. The government levies taxes on ﬁrms proﬁts, pays
unemployment beneﬁts and set minimum wages, according to the policy setting, absorbing excess
proﬁts and losses from the bank and keeping a relatively balanced budget in the long run.7

3.1 The entry and exit processes

We expanded the K+S model accounting for a variable number of ﬁrms in both the consumption-
and the capital-good sectors (F 1
In the new version of the model, entry and exit are now
independent processes. As before, ﬁrms leave the market whenever their market shares get close to
zero or their net assets turn negative (bankruptcy). However, and in line with Dosi et al. (1995), we
now deﬁne the number of entrants by means of the random variables b1

rules already set in the original model. For more details, including the model conﬁguration, the timeline of events and

in each sector, y ∈ {i, j}, accordingly. So, M C z
t measures the sectoral liquidity-to-debt ratio and thus
the tightness of the credit market, and M Az
t is a proxy to its dynamics. Correspondingly, negative
(positive) values of M Az
t represent leveraged (deleveraged) markets, meaning debt is growing faster
(slower) than the accumulation of cash equivalents. This means that whenever the incumbents’
ﬁnancial conditions are sound – the overall liquidity-to-debt ratio is shrinking – ﬁrms are more
inclined to enter, and vice versa.

The adopted formulation for the entry process tries to model some well known facts in the
industrial dynamics and business cycle literature: (i) the number of entrants is proportional to the
number of incumbent ﬁrms (Geroski, 1991, 1995), (ii) entry is aﬀected by the easiness of access to
credit (Kerr and Nanda, 2009; Bertrand et al., 2007), (iii) the process is pro-cyclical (Gomis et al.,
2017; Lee and Mukoyama, 2015).

3.2 The labour market and skills dynamics

The labour market in the model implements a fully-decentralized search and hiring process between
workers and ﬁrms (more on that in Dosi et al., 2016, 2017). The aggregate supply of labour LS is
ﬁxed and all workers are available to be hired in any period. Also, the labour market is characterised
by imperfect information. When unemployed, workers submit a certain number of job applications to
ﬁrms. Employed workers may apply or not for better positions, according to the institutional set-up
(see Section 3.3 below). Larger ﬁrms, in terms of market share, have a proportionally higher prob-
ability of receiving job applications, which are organized in separated, ﬁrm-speciﬁc queues. Firms
decide about their individual labour demand based on the received orders (capital-good sector), the
expected demand (consumption-good sector), and the expected labour productivity level. Consid-
ering the number and the productivity of the already employed workers, ﬁrms decide to (i) hire
new workers, (ii) ﬁre part of the existing ones, or (iii) keep the existing labour force. Each hiring
ﬁrm deﬁnes a unique wage oﬀer for the applicant workers, based on its internal conditions and the
received applications. Workers select the best oﬀer they get from the ﬁrms to which they submitted
applications, if any. If already employed, they quit the current job if a better wage oﬀer is received.
There is no second round of bargaining between workers and ﬁrms in the same period and, so, ﬁrms
have no guarantee of fulﬁlling all the open positions (no market clearing). Moreover, there are no
ﬁring or hiring transaction costs.

We extended the K+S model to account for the process of workers’ skills accumulation and
deterioration. Such a process is driven by the worker-speciﬁc job tenures, assuming a learning-by-
doing process when employed and a gradual deterioration of skills while unemployed, assuming ﬁrms
keep introducing new techniques all the time, deprecating the skills of unemployed workers. The skill
level s(cid:96),t > 0 of each worker (cid:96) evolves over time as a multiplicative process:

s(cid:96),t =

(4)

with the learning rate τ ≥ 0 a parameter. As a consequence, when worker (cid:96) is employed her skills
improve over time, as she becomes more experienced in her task. Conversely, unemployed workers
lose skills. In particular, when a worker is hired, she may immediately acquire the minimum level
of skills already present in the ﬁrm (the existing worker with the lowest skills), if above her present
level. Also, workers have a ﬁxed working life. After a ﬁxed number of periods Tr ∈ N∗ in the labour
market, workers retire and are replaced by younger ones,8 whose skills are equivalent to the current
minimum level in the incumbent ﬁrms.

the same skills level.

to produce more (if s(cid:96),t > ¯st) or less (otherwise) when using a certain machine technology, in relation
to the expected vintage productivity. The worker eﬀective production depends, yet, on its utilization
in the production process, according to the ﬁrms desired production level Qd
j,t. Note that the sectoral
aggregation over the ﬁrm-level eﬀective productivities Aj,t is a truly emergent properties of the model,
resulting, simultaneously, from the technical innovation dynamics (mainly, the introduction of new
vintages Aτ
i ), the worker skills accumulation/deterioration process and the eﬀective demand, which
guides ﬁrms when deciding Qd
j,t, the capital stock dynamics and the employed machine mix (see Dosi
et al., 2010 for more details).

The inﬂuence of the workers’ skills upon production reﬂects a learning by tenure/doing mechanism
well established in the literature at least since the seminal contribution of Arrow (1962). On the
empirical side, for the links between job tenure, capability accumulation and ﬁrm productivity, see
Zhou et al. (2011) and Lucidi and Kleinknecht (2009), among others.

3.3 Alternative labour-market policy regimes

We employ the model described above to study two alternative policy regimes, which we call Fordist
(our baseline) and Competitive.9 The policy regimes are telegraphically sketched in Table 1.

Under the Fordist regime, wages are insensitive to the labour market conditions and indexed to
the productivity gains of the ﬁrms. There is a sort of covenant between ﬁrms and workers concerning
“long term” employment: ﬁrms ﬁre only when their proﬁts become negative, while workers are loyal to
employers and do not seek for alternative jobs. When hiring/ﬁring, ﬁrms aim to keep the more skilled
worker. Labour market institutions contemplate a minimum wage fully indexed to the aggregate
economy productivity and unemployment beneﬁts ﬁnanced by taxes on proﬁts. Conversely, in the
Competitive regime, ﬂexible wages respond to unemployment and the decentralised labour market
dynamics, and are set by means of an asymmetric bargaining process where ﬁrms have the last say.
Employed workers search for better paid jobs with some positive probability and ﬁrms freely adjust
(ﬁre) their excess workforce according to their planned production. Hiring/ﬁring workers by ﬁrms
are based on a balance between skills and wages, using a simple payback comparison rule. The
Competitive regime is also characterized by diﬀerent labour institutions: minimum wage is only
partially indexed to productivity and unemployment beneﬁts – and the associated taxes on proﬁts –
are relatively lower.

4 Empirical validation

The K+S model is able to generate endogenous growth and business cycles, emergent crises, and
to reproduce a rich set of macro (e.g., relative volatility, co-movements, etc.) and micro (ﬁrm size
distributions, ﬁrm productivity dynamics, etc.)
stylized facts (see Dosi et al., 2010, 2013, 2015,
2017). In addition, the labour-enhanced version of the model (Dosi et al., 2016, 2017), which explic-
itly accounts for microeconomic ﬁrm-worker interactions, has already proved to be able to robustly
reproduce most of the labour market macro empirical regularities.10

level. MC standard errors in parentheses. Non-rate series are Baxter-King bandpass-ﬁltered (6,32,12).

The extensions to the K+S model proposed here added some new empirical regularities matched
by the model. First, the new labour force learning dynamics dynamics produce fat-tailed skills
(worker level) and productivity (ﬁrm level) distributions, consistent with the empirical evidence
suggesting the presence of both ﬁrm- and worker-speciﬁc heterogeneity. Second, the improved entry
dynamics increased the number of the model variables that match the usual cross-correlation/lag
structure among aggregated macro indicators. As shown in Table 2, net entry is pro-cyclical and
lagging with respect to GDP, coherently with the speciﬁed state-dependent entry dynamics, but also
counter-cyclical and leading on GDP. Time series correlation structure of some ﬁnancial variables
also added new insights. While the Fordist regime presents the same lag structure already revealed
in Dosi et al. (2013), at least in terms of debt pro-cyclicality, in the Competitive regime debt is just
mildly pro-cyclical and more lagged.
In fact, credit (debt) is now also a slightly counter-cyclical
leading indicator to GDP, as suggested by empirical data.

5 At the roots of hysteresis

Let us study the emergence of hysteresis in our model, addressing the possible causes and discussing
the consequences for the economic dynamics. We will ﬁrst study inter-regime long-run hysteresis (cf.
Figure 1), also testing the Blanchard-Summers hypothesis (Section 5.1). We will then analyse the
emergence of intra-regime transient hysteresis (Section 5.2).

processes and on the related variables and parameters.

5.1 Regime change: super hysteresis

We begin with the long-run dynamics of the model, when aﬀected by an institutional shock, namely
the introduction of “structural reforms” aimed at increasing the ﬂexibility of the labour market,
leaving however untouched the technological fundamentals. In our policy typology, the reforms are
supposed to move the labour market regime from a Fordist to a Competitve set-up (see Section 3.3
above). In that, we are implicitly testing the insider-outsider hypothesis of hysteresis proposed by
Blanchard and Summers (1987). The normative implication of such hypothesis is the advocacy of
a more ﬂexible labour market, where unions have lower bargaining power in the wage formation
process, with the aim of making wages more respondent to unemployment conditions. In our model,
the transition from a Fordist toward a Competitive type of labour relations captures the structural
reforms, aimed at achieving both numerical (easier ﬁring) and wage ﬂexibility (wages more respondent
to unemployment), as illustrated in Table 1.11

In Figure 2, we report the time series of the main macroeconomic variables in the two regimes.12
The institutional shock occurs at time t = 100 (the vertical dotted line). The widening GDP gap
between the two regimes, as presented in Figure 2.a, shows how the structural reforms determine
not only super hysteresis (i.e., a permanently lower growth rate of the GDP), but even a form of
asymptotic hysteresis, whereby the eﬀects propagate in the very long-run (see also Dosi et al., 2017,
2016). The actual level of the long-run capacity utilization increases from the 85% to 90% after the
introduction of the Competitive regime (cf. Figure 2.b), hinting at a process of underinvestment
due to the worsened business opportunities for ﬁrms. In the Competitive regime, as a result of the
depressed wage dynamics, increased GDP volatility, and their eﬀect on the aggregate demand, ﬁrms
reduce the average expansionary investments, which depend on the diﬀerence between (demand-led)
desired and installed production capacity, pushing down the number of machines ordered from the
capital-good sector. As a result, ﬁrms decrease the gap between the eﬀective production and the
potential capacity, which leads to a cyclical surge in the capacity utilization, that is, during good
times ﬁrms utilize almost all the available capital to produce goods. The capital accumulation is
slower when structural reforms are in place: the long-run growth rate falls from 1.55% to 1.44% per
period. Figure 2.c shows the dynamics of unemployment and vacancy rates, which are negatively
correlated, consistent with a Beveridge Curve, while unemployment is signiﬁcantly higher in the
Competitive regime. The negative eﬀects of structural reforms spill over the long-run: the number
of successful innovations in the capital-good sector takes a sustained lower trajectory (Figure 2.d)
and the average level of workers skills is signiﬁcantly reduced (Figure 2.e). Finally, the trend of the
net entry13 of ﬁrms in the market is more turbulent after the reforms, indicating a higher level of
volatility in credit conditions (Figure 2.f).14

The diﬀerent performance of the two regimes is quantitatively summarised in Table 3, which
presents the averages and the ratios between selected variables of the two set-ups and also the p-
values for a t test comparing the averages. The results conﬁrm, at a 5% signiﬁcance level, that
after the introduction of structural reforms the short- and long-run performance of the economy
signiﬁcantly worsens. Note that as the technological conﬁguration of the model is invariant between
the two regime speciﬁcations, the signiﬁcant eﬀects on the productivity, innovation and imitation
rates are entirely caused by the institutional shock.15

11Indeed, the change of the political structure and of the balance of power between capitalists and workers and
the related results of a class struggle are phenomena which, if might have some economic roots, did occur at the
socio-political level. For this reason, we perform a comparative static analysis, mimicking a quasi-natural experiment
with a “treated” and “control” group.

12The presented series are the averages of 50 Monte Carlo simulation runs, over 500 periods. The initial 100

“warm-up” periods are not presented.

13The use of the two-sided H-P ﬁlter produces the diverging patterns of the two curves before time t = 100.
14Entry decision in the model is also driven by the average ﬁnancial conditions of the ﬁrms in each sector.
15In accordance with the behavioural rules set in the model (cf. Dosi et al., 2010 and Dosi et al., 2017), the dynamics
of innovation, of imitation, of new machines introduction and, consequently, of the ﬁrms productivity growth is directly

What are the drivers of the soaring super hysteresis in the model? The huge surge in unemploy-
ment reﬂects the widening gap between the long-run dynamics of real wages in the two regimes,16
which, in turn, leads to the emergence of Keynesian unemployment due to the contraction of aggre-
gate demand and the slowdown on the skills accumulation and on the productivity growth. Figure
3 shows the box-plot comparison between the Monte Carlo simulation runs for the two regimes, for
the long-term consequences in terms of the innovation and imitation rates, productivity growth, job
tenure, workers skills and net entry of ﬁrms (see Section 2). The results in the ﬁrst row of plots
(Figure 3.a, b and c) indicate a reduction in the innovation and imitation rates in the majority of the
simulation runs – the latter variables are calculated as the rate of successful innovators and imitators
in the capital-good sector – and, as a consequence, in the productivity growth rate. This is an indi-
rect outcome of the fall in the aggregate demand, which yields lower R&D expenditure by ﬁrms.17
In the same direction, the results in the second row of Figure 3 show the quite signiﬁcant fall on the
average tenure period (plot d) and the ensuing slower pace of the workers skills accumulation (plot
e), which, in turn, also has a direct and negative eﬀect on the growth of productivity. Finally, the
dynamics of net entry (number of entrants minus the exiting ﬁrms) is presented in plot f.18 According
to the adopted entry rule, the ﬁnancial conditions of incumbents do aﬀect the decision to enter in the
market. In the presence of overall improving ﬁnancial state of ﬁrms, e.g., whenever there is a grow-
ing sectoral diﬀerence between net worth (liquid assets) and debt, ﬁrms are more inclined to enter.
However, note that in the Competitive regime the ﬁnancial cycle is ampliﬁed due to the increased
volatility, exacerbating the entry dynamics:
in good times there are more entrants in Competitive
than in the Fordist regime, which exhibits a stabler ﬁnancial cycle, while the opposite occurs in bad
times. Both phenomena, the more pronounced leverage cycle and the tighter availability of credit,
have been documented by Ng and Wright (2013) as emerging business cycle stylised facts from the
last three recessions (1990, 2001, 2007).

The transmission channels in the model operate through both numerical and wage ﬂexibility.
First, higher numerical ﬂexibility, where workers are more freely ﬁred, determines a sharp drop in
workers job tenure and, indirectly, has a negative eﬀect on skills accumulation and, consequently,
on productivity. Not only the ﬁring rule, but also the ﬁring order criteria aﬀect the dynamics of
productivity growth. In the Fordist regime, ﬁrms hire (ﬁre) ﬁrst workers with higher (lower) skills.19

aﬀected by the overall macroeconomic conditions, including those directly impacted by the reforms. This creates a
(potentially hysteretic) reinforcing feedback process between the macro and the technological domains, which in part
explains the observed results.

16The real wages growth rates are 1.47% and 1.35% per period, respectively.
17See Dosi et al., 2010 for details on the innovation process.
18The diverging trend before time t = 100 is due to the two-sided H-P ﬁlter we employ to detrend the series.
19This is a necessary consequence of the ﬁrms unilaterally decided and homogeneously applied wage adjustments,

so skills are the only heterogeneous metric among workers in a Fordist ﬁrm.

guide to preferentially hire (ﬁre) workers with superior (inferior) ratios. Such a behaviour has a
negative impact on the aggregate skills level of the incumbent workers over time. On the other hand,
higher wage ﬂexibility, by limiting the wage indexation upon the productivity gains, causes a straight-
forward drop in the aggregate demand via the reduced consumption of workers. In turn, the shrinking
sales opportunities drive a fall in investment and labour demand, which induces more unemployment,
characterising a typical Keynesian feedback-ampliﬁed downturn. Moreover, the slower economy also
impacts upon the entry/exit and the innovation/imitation rates, via the overall cut in total R&D
expenditure and the higher volatility in the number of operating ﬁrms. In fact, Table 2 show the
signiﬁcant level of correlation between the business cycle and the net entry of ﬁrms in the market.

To sum up, our simulation experiments on the K+S model – extended with endogenous ﬁrms
entry and workers skills accumulation/deterioration – generically yield super hysteresis stemming
from an institutional shock. Indeed, institutions are a “carrier of history” (David, 1994) also here.
However, contrary to the insider-outsider hypothesis (Blanchard and Summers, 1987) “pro-market”
institutions bear a negative hysteretic eﬀect. However, our results seem to provide a more consistent
explanation for its main causes and also bring a critical warning. The model suggests that structural
reforms aimed at increasing the ﬂexibility in the labour market, may well spur even more hysteresis
instead of reducing it. Considering that, in the next section, we focus on intra-regime hysteresis
phenomena.

5.2 Detecting intra-regime hysteresis

Assessing the emergence of intra-regime hysteresis is not a trivial task as there is no unifying test or
even widely accepted criteria for this. However, there are several properties and techniques which do
help uncover particular aspects of hysteresis. In the following, we present a set of analytical methods,
summarized in Table 4, which provide evidence of the presence of hysteretical properties in the K+S
model. In line with the literature, we study whether the time series generated by the model present
evidence of (i) remanence, (ii) persistency, (iii) nonlinearity, (iv) path-dependency, and (v) super
hysteresis. Needless to say, these properties are to some degree overlapping.

Figure 4 illustrates the number of periods (grey area) necessary to put the economy back to
the pre-crisis growth trend (dashed line) in typical simulation runs.20 The analysis is inspired by
(Blanchard et al., 2015) and simply performs an extrapolation of the long-run GDP trend to detect
the recovery from crises under the presence of hysteresis. The results show the coexistence of shorter
business cycle downturns with longer, hysteretical crises, requiring signiﬁcant more times for the
economy to recover. Note also the presence of super hysteresis, revealed by the diﬀerent slopes of
the peak to to peak GDP trends (dashed lines).

Table 5 reports the average recovery duration for both the GDP and the mean unemployment
time (the average period a worker takes to ﬁnd a new job). While the duration of the GDP trend
recovery is similar among regimes (around 16 quarters), the unemployment time takes almost ﬁve
times more to return to its pre-crisis level in the Competitive case. In order to better assess the
severity of the crises, we also track the peak GDP trend deviation during the recovery period (the
farther the GDP gets from the pre-crisis trend) and the accumulated GDP losses in comparison to
the trend (the crisis “cost”). The model robustly shows how Competitive regime crises are about
two times deeper than in the Fordist scenario. The accumulated GDP losses comparison leads to a
similar conclusion.

In Table 6, we report a set of statistical tests to detect unit-roots/stationarity (Augmented

20A crisis is deﬁned by a 3% drop of the GDP in a single period which is not recovered in the next three periods.
The pre-crisis level is calculated as the average GDP for the four periods before the crisis and the trend, as the output
of an H-P ﬁlter at the period just before the crisis. The crisis is considered recovered when the GDP reaches back the
pre-crisis trend level.

results present the frequency of the rejection of the null hypothesis for the set of 50 runs at the usual
5% signiﬁcance level (see Table 6 for the deﬁnition of H0 in each case).

The results of the tests suggest that GDP, productivity and wage growth rates more frequently
exhibit stationary (no unit-roots) behaviour in both regimes. More borderline, the unemployment
rate time series seems to be more commonly stationary among simulation runs in the Fordist regime,
while more likely non-stationary in the Competitive case. The nonlinearity test indicates a more
nuanced situation: the unemployment series is the one more frequently nonlinear (not i.i.d.), partic-
ularly in the Competitive regime, while the wage growth rates series are more likely linear (i.i.d.).
Finally, the less powerful KS test cannot reject ergodicity for the majority of run pairs tested, while
WW indicates the non-ergodicity of all series.

There are a few take-home messages from the tests. The ﬁrst is that mixed results, e.g., on

In fact, they show the diﬀerent
statistical properties of alternative sample-paths: only an outright non rejection of the null hypothesis
could be claimed in support of the the lack of hysteresis. Second, but related, the tests aimed at
the detection of some underlying, emergent, non-linear structure, are quite encouraging despite the
limited length of the sample paths.22

We performed a global sensitivity analysis (SA) to explore the eﬀects of alternative model
parametrisations and to gain further insights on the robustness of our exercises on institutional
shocks.23 Out of the 57 parameters and initial conditions in the K+S model, we reduce the rele-
vant parametric dimensionality to 29, by means of an Elementary Eﬀect screening procedure which
allowed discarding from the analysis the parameters which do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the selected
model outputs.24 In order to understand the eﬀect of each of the 29 parameters over the selected
metrics, we perform a Sobol decomposition.25 Because of the relatively high computational costs to
produce the decomposition using the original model, a simpliﬁed version of it – a meta-model – was
build using the Kriging method and employed for the Sobol SA.26 The meta-model is estimated by
numerical maximum likelihood using a set of observations (from the original model) sampled using a
high-eﬃciency, nearly-orthogonal Latin hypercube design of experiments (Cioppa and Lucas, 2007).27
The main indicator used for the SA is the accumulated GDP losses during the crises’ recovery
It seems a sensible choice, as it conveys information about both the

periods, as deﬁned above.

22The choice of the adequate time window length is quite relevant when analysing hysteresis, as detailed in Section
2.1, and it is not driven by the availability of simulated data. For this reason we split the analysis in inter-regime
hysteresis, where the patterns are of long term type, and the intra-regime hysteresis. For comparability with empirical
data, to check for the intra-regime hysteresis we restricted the time span to 50 runs (12.5 years), which is closer to
the empirical time horizons. Note that taking longer time spans would simply “dilute” some hysteretic properties of
the series, like non ergodicity or non-stationarity: in the very long run most real economic series look stationary and
ergodic.

23For technical details on the global sensitivity analysis methodology, see Dosi et al. (2016).
24Brieﬂy, the Elementary Eﬀects technique proposes both a speciﬁc design of experiments, to eﬃciently sample the
parameter space under a one-factor-at-a-time, and some linear regression statistics, to evaluate direct and indirect
(nonlinear/non-additive) eﬀects of parameters on the model results (Morris, 1991, Saltelli et al., 2008).

25The Sobol decomposition is a variance-based, global SA method consisting in the decomposition of the variance
of the chosen model output into fractions according to the variances of the parameters selected for analysis, better
dealing with nonlinearities and non-additive interactions than traditional local SA methods. It allows to disentangle
both direct and interaction quantitative eﬀects of the parameters on the chosen metrics (Sobol, 1993, Saltelli et al.,
2008).

26In summary, the Kriging meta-model “mimics” our original model by a simpler, mathematically-tractable approx-
imation. Kriging is an interpolation method that under fairly general assumptions provides the best linear unbiased
predictors for the response of complex, non-linear computer simulation models (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006, Salle
and Yildizoglu, 2014).

27Due to space restrictions we cannot present all the tests statistics here but they can be requested to the authors.

duration and the intensity of the crises, as such among the key properties of hysteresis. Interestingly,
this indicator is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced only by a limited set of parameters (and no initial condition),
namely the learning rate parameter (τ ), the retirement age (Tr), the replicator equation parameter
(χ), the maximum technical advantage of the capital-good entrants (x5), and the minimum capital
ratio (Φ1) and the expected capacity utilization (u) of the consumption-good entrants. The two
parameters associated with the skills accumulation process, learning rate (τ ) and retirement age
(Tr), are jointly responsible for almost 80% of the variance of the losses indicator over the entire
parametric space in both policy regimes.

Figure 5.a and 5.b presents an exploration of the model response surface, using the Kriging
meta-model, for the two critical skills-related parameters. The rugged surfaces, in particular in the
Competitive regime, clearly indicate the nonlinear nature of the system, in tune with the require-
ments for hysteretic behaviours. The sensitivity analysis of the model seems to suggest that the
prominent parameters inﬂuencing the level of hysteresis observed in the losses indicator are those
directly connected with the workers skills accumulation process (τ and Tr), the ﬁrm entry mecha-
nism (Φ1, u and x5) and the market competitiveness (χ). Directly or in interaction among them,
these 5 parameters account for 95% of the variation of the GDP crises losses in the model for the
two scenarios. This ensures that the comparisons between policy regimes presented above are not
inﬂuenced by speciﬁc conﬁguration settings. As can be seen in Figure 5, the Competitive regime
tends to produce signiﬁcant higher GDP crises losses irrespective of the model set-up (notice that
the peak losses in plot (a), the blue dot, are at a lower z axis level than the deepest valley in plot
(b), the green dot). Finally, the response surfaces in both regimes show that in general the higher
the learning rate (τ ), the higher is the accumulated GDP losses during the crises’ recovery periods.
The latter positive marginal eﬀect hints at the fact that the higher the ﬁrm speciﬁc capabilities, the
more diﬃcult is to rebuilt the ﬁrm skills destroyed by a crisis, and to be back to the pre-crisis level.
All in all, the statistical tests results indicate that model has a rather frequent tendency to
produce runs which show the properties usually associated with hysteresis in its main variables, in
particular the unemployment rate, whenever hit by an endogenously-produced crisis. Recoveries can

social cost of unemployment, are severe. It is also signiﬁcant that such losses seem to increase after
the introduction of structural reforms of the type discussed above.

6 Conclusions

A revival of the debate on hysteresis has emerged in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Together,
the evidence forced revisiting the standard approach of modelling unit-root processes as good can-
didates to explain the persistent deviations from the pre-crisis trends. Not only the level trends of
GDP and unemployment, but even the growth rates in many countries are still persistently bellow
the pre-2008 ﬁgures, leading to the importance of a stronger notion of hysteresis.

As an alternative, an expanding tradition of scholars have been discussing the notions of hys-
teresis and path dependence, identifying in coordination failures and persistent eﬀects of aggregate
demand upon productivity the main sources of long-term deviation from stable growth trajectories.
Nested into the latter literature, here we have presented an ABM which intertwines a Schumpeterian
engine of growth and a Keynesian generation of demand, declined under two institutional labour-
market variants, labelled as Fordist and Competitive regimes. The transition from the Fordist to the
Competitive regime captured “structural reforms” aimed at increasing labour market ﬂexibility.

The model is able to generically exhibits path dependence, nonlinearity and non-ergodicity in
its main macroeconomic variables, presenting both inter-regime and intra-regime hysteresis as a
bottom-up emergent property. In a more speciﬁc instance, the model fails in providing support to
the Blanchard and Summers (1986) insider-outsider hypothesis, according to which more ﬂexible
labour relations might reduce hysteresis. On the contrary, the model suggests that both numerical
and wage ﬂexibility are quite prone to increase the hysteretic properties of the macroeconomic system.
