ABSTRACT 

The financial intermediary sector has big importance for developing countries. The main theories 
and hypotheses of industrial organization literature seek to analyze the bank market as profit-maximizing 
and wealth-generating. However, bank does not is a regular firm, because there is the social expectation 
under efficiency in its function of intermediation. At this point we raise the hypothesis that there is a positive 
relationship between market power and the demand behaviors, and we draw the objective of measuring the 
size of the deadweight-loss generated annually by the conduct of the banks in Brazil. Thus, we apply Daskin 
(1991)  approach  together  with  price  elasticity  of  demand  that  we  estimate  utilizing  the  Berry  (1994) 
procedure for the Time Deposit and Saving deposit segments and Berry Levinsonh and Pakes (1995) for 
the Loans segment. As a result, we find that the deadweight-loss produced by commercial banks in these 
segments oscillates between 0.29% to 0.42% of average annual Gross Domestic Product or between 7% to 
13% of average total revenue of the banking sector. The paper also brings the evolution of price elasticity 
of demand over 2009-2016 years for whole Brazil and its five macro-regions, besides of price elasticity of 
this period of each county on what there is a bank branch. 

 

RESUMO 

O setor de intermediação financeira tem grande importância para os países em desenvolvimento. As 
principais teorias e hipóteses da literatura de Organização Industrial buscam analisar o mercado bancário a 
partir  da  ótica  contábil  considerando  essas  firmas  maximizadoras  de  lucro  e  geradoras  de  riqueza.  No 
entanto, os bancos não são firmas regulares, pois existe uma expectativa social que permeia a eficiências 
destas firmas na intermediação financeira. Neste ponto, a hipótese de que existe uma relação positiva entre 
o poder de mercado e o comportamento da demanda é levantada juntamente com o objetivo de auferir o 
tamanho  do  peso-morto  gerado  anualmente  pela  conduta  dos  bancos  brasileiros.  Para  isso,  aplica-se  a 
abordagem  de  Daskin  (1991)  auxiliada  pela  elasticidade  preço  da  demanda  estimada  por  meio  do 
procedimento de Berry (1994) para os segmentos de Depósito a Prazo e Poupança e Berry Levinsonh and 
Pakes  (1995)  para  o  segmento  de  Empréstimos.  Dos  resultados,  verifica-se  que  a  perda  de  peso-morto 
produzida pelos bancos comerciais oscila entre 0,29% a 0,42% da média anual do PIB ou entre 7% e 13% 
da receita média total do setor bancário. O artigo também apresenta a evolução da elasticidade preço da 
demanda  ao  longo  dos  anos  2009-2016  para  todo  o  Brasil  e  para  as  cinco  macrorregiões,  além  da 
distribuição da elasticidade média deste período para cada município onde existe uma agência bancária.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The current approach of the industrial organization brings as consensus that the researcher should 
not  be  treat  the  financial  intermediation  like  an  ordinary  market.  Since  that  banks  must  make  decisions 
about risk and diversification, the relationship with managers of small firms seems to be the better way to 
reduce costs (Petersen & Rajan, 1994). Thus, the essence of financial intermediation is twofold: increase 
the banking  competition  through excessive risk-taking by banks;  and, or, allocate the resources in  large 
portfolios and to reduce costs through diversification. However, neither of these two extremes can generate 
an efficient financial system (Allen & Gale, 2004).  The maximum economics welfare is one whose the 
aggregate investment is a result of the effective multiplication of means of payment wherein the bank will 
no refuse good project, and both, the banker and investor, will maximize their surpluses (Yanelle, 1989). 

This  is  the  case  in  most  developed  economies,  but  it  is  still  somewhat  obscure  in  developing 
countries. The crisis sequence initiated by Mexico in 1994 (followed by the East Asia in 1997, Russia and 
Brazil in 1998 and Argentina in 2001) showed the fragility of the financial system of these countries depend 
on foreign investment. The development of this crisis sequences culminated in a period of large margins 
for Latin American banks, which began to divide the resources available for loans destined to the private 
sector or destined to the public sector (Chortareas, Girardone, & Garza-García, 2010). The need to finance 
government expenditures may, at some relative risk, shift available resources putting some strain on highly 
leveraged  firms  or  to  generate  working  capital  shortages  that  amplify  the  market  frictions  (see  Bonfim, 
2009). 
These working capital shortages represent a cost to society that is referred in industrial organization 
 
and microeconomics literatures as deadweight-loss (DWL). In Latin American, Brazil is the country with 
the lowest rate of lending, in terms of GDP (Gross Domestic Product), to the private market (Chortareas, 
Girardone, & Garza-García, 2010). However, the highest net interest margins make of this country facing 
the same problem as the other countries in the region (some degree of distrust of foreign investment). Thus, 
the  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  analyze  the  welfare  economic  due  to  the  conduct  of  commercial  banks 
presents  in  Brazil  that  act  in  segments  of  Loans  (LO)  and  Time  Deposits  (TD),  as  well  to  evaluate  the 
distribution  of  price  elasticity  of  demand  for  county  and  its  evolution  for  2009-2016  period  at  these 
segments.  
 
In Industrial Organization theory, researchers are testing so many theories for regular firms and its 
market  power.  In  this  context,  we  have  at  least  three  main  hypotheses:  original  efficiency  analysis,  by 
Structure-Conduct-Performance (SCP) hypothesis (see Smirlock, 1985), seeks the positive correlation for 
market  share-profit  relationship  that  signalizes  the  main  source  of  market  power.  However,  Shepherd 
(1986) proposes the Relative Market Power (RMP), that adds the concentration variable in the explanatory 
equation  of  profit  together  with  market  share,  under  the  assumptions  that  market  power  occurs 
independently of any source of domination. A third hypothesis is Quiet Life (QLH – initially proposed by 
Hicks, 1935) that indicates that an increase in the market power brings a decrease in efficiency and so an 
impossibility  of  a  bank  earning  higher  profitability.  In  QLH,  the  efficiency  is  key  for  explicating  the 
profitability and three points are central: allocation optics, production dimension and scale dimension (see 
e.g. Fiordelisi, 2004). To refute or accept Quiet Life Hypotheses talks with to refute or accept Competition-
Fragility  and  Competition-Stability  hypotheses.  These  last  two  hypotheses  are  specifically  for  bank 
literature and indicates that an increase in competition, decreases the bank efficiency and increase financial 
fragility for first and an increase in competition, promotes an increase in financial efficiency and increase 
stability in the financial intermediation sector for second. 
 
We  understand  that  all  these  hypotheses  concern  with  the  accounting  of  firms  (profitability 
generation  or  shareholder  wealth  and  its  consequences  for  other  banks).  Notwithstanding,  bank  is  not  a 
regular firm because it participates from the financial intermediation sector and, besides efficiencies, banks 
also exert the development paper. Thus, we propose to test is if the increase of deadweight-loss is positively 
correlated with increase of market power of bank (Lerner-Demand Hypothesis). In Short, these hypotheses 
are based in monopoly theory, where a monopolistic firms act in the elastic region of demand and, if the 

 

1 

deadweight loss generates by banks in each county is true, the correlation between market power (Lerner 
Index) and elasticities-price of demand, in absolute terms, should be positive2 and significative. 

In the banking literature of welfare analysis, Rhoades (1972) estimated the market power profit to 
monopoly banking over 2,000 markets (1,635 and 194 of 2,466 counties and 281 SMSAs of United States, 
respectively)  and  founded  a  welfare-loss  around  $11.9m  of  dollars.  However,  Rhoades  followed  the 
Harberger  (1954)  with  partial  equilibrium,  assuming  a  constant  unit  elasticity  of  demand.  From  this 
position, this author ignored the very differences of the banks and acts place in the market concentration 
that may  generate a bias in  analysis. We  propose to  correct  this  bias assuming the procedure of Daskin 
(1991) allied with the approach of Berry (1994) for calculating the price elasticity of demand.  In the Lerner 
Index  cost  we  considered  the  Fundação  Instituto  de  Pesquisa  Contábeis,  Autuariais  e  Financeiras 
(FIPECAFI, Foundation for Actuarial and Financial Accounting in English, 2004) report. 

Maudos & Guevara (2007) analyzed the relationship between market power, in loan and deposit 
segments, and X-efficiency for EU-15 countries in period of 1993-2002. The authors founded that welfare-
loss in 2002 was 0.54% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In line with Rhoades, Solís & Maudos (2008) 
used the Harberger’s triangle for Mexican banking between 1993-2005 and founded that the social cost 
attributable to market power in 2005 was 0.15% of Mexican GDP. The analysis of these authors assumes 
that banks competes via outputs. In this point, we argue that these analyses may fail in market whose banks 
do not compete as a Cournot market or when the analysis do not consider the outside good in decision of 
agents, because the financial intermediation is compounded by banks, credit unions, Grameen bank and so 
on.  Berry  (1994)  procedure,  in  calculating  the  price  elasticity  of  demand,  assume  the  theory  of  indirect 
utility of demand, where a consumer chose to demand deposits or loans through a set of bank factors. These 
technical features are like a transitive basket and satisfies the hypotheses of consumer theory. Therefore, 
we are assuming that  a determined bank adopts  it strategic considering  what of the other banks  that are 
adopting in market, like a theoretical Cartel structure. 

Finally, Silva and Lucinda (2017) analyzed structure of market from switching cost view and found 
that the relationship, between bank and costumer, produces an average cost of R$ 471,17 (four hundred 
seventh-one and seventeen cents of Reais) per account. We complement this analyzes with DWL calculated 
from ESTBAN (Data base of Central Bank of Brazil that brings banking statistic for Brazilian counties and 
bank  branch).  Thus,  we  contributed  by  mapping  the  distribution  of  the  elasticities  for  whole  Brazilian 
counties, where commercial banks act. We also present the evolution over time of elasticities throughout 
2009-2016 period. As a result, we find that the DWL produced by financial institutions in the downstream 
segments  oscillates  around  about  0.30%  of  Brazilian  GPD  annually  with  the  average  elasticity.  Time 
Deposit segment presented the ration DWL/GDP around about 0.06%, while the DWL/GDP ratio for the 
loans segment was 0.24%. However, in both, TD and LO segments, the average elasticity is different of the 
median elasticity and therefore the DWL  do not follows a normal  distribution  for counties. For this  we 
present a graph, that summarize the distribution of DWL as elasticity increases. This analyzes indicates a 
median elasticity region of 2.0 for Time Deposit segment and a median elasticity region of 3.0 for Loans 
segment. 

We structure this paper in more four parts: Section 2 describes the methodology used in the proposed 
analysis.  This  section  is  subdivided  in  demand  analysis,  deadweight-loss  analysis  and  econometric 
procedures.  Section  3  will  be  presenting  the  data.  Section  4  discusses  the  results  and  issues.  A  brief 
conclusion follows.  

 

2.  METHODOLOGY 

2.1. Stylized facts 
The  model  begins  with  indirect  utility  of  demand  approach.  The  methodology  procedure  is 
presented  by  Berry  (1994)  and  we  adapt  it  to  the  banking  sector  where  the  consumers  are  interested  in 
purchasing Saving Deposit (sv), Time Deposit (td) or Loans (l) services in m Brazilians counties’ markets 
(m = 1, ..., M) of j financial institutions (j = 0, …, J) in time t.  

                                                 
2 This point is positive in a direct analyze, theoretically the Lerner index is equal the inverse of elasticity in absolute 

term. In this view the relationship should be negative.

The researcher observes  the  individuals  I  (i = 1,  ... Im) in  aggregate forms by  counties and  your 
choices are view like a market share of each bank in these counties. However, the choices j = 0 (zero) means 
the outside-good allocation of consumer money. Is a like paper Money Held by the Public calculated in a 
Monetary Economic approach. This raises some implications for the relevant market because the individual 
may live in city m=i and have a bank account in county m=j (for i≠j).  

Thus, our relevant market is based on the microregions defined by Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia 
e Estatística (IBGE or Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography in English). For to compute the market 
shares with outside-good in each microregion, we considerate the total of remuneration presents in these 
localities  (sums  of  wages  of  formal  workers,  pensions  and  government  aids)  as  weighting  of  the  stock 
variables  (monthly  balance  of  TD,  SD  and  LO  segments)  disclosed  by  Banco  Central  do  Brasil  (BCB, 
Central Bank of Brazil in English).

The angular coefficients 𝛼𝑙 𝛼𝑡𝑑, 𝛼𝑎𝑑 e 𝛽 summarizes consumer preferences. 
 

 
Like Berry (1994), we suppose that term of error 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 is type 2 (two) i.i.d. with the “extreme value” 
distribution function exp (-exp (-ε)). Thus, the predict share of bank j for the three products (here appraised) 
is then given by the well-known logit formula:

The  linearization  of  the  Accumulated  Logistic  Distribution  Function  (FDA)  allows  us  to  find

The correlations presented by error of type 2 (two) listed above are due to the characteristics of the 
banks that are perceived by the individuals and highlighted by the BCB. Thus, we controlled this bias by 
three nested that resumes the features of banks. These categories are: commercial banks, public banks and 
multiple banks. By including these groups, the demand equation becomes:

2.3.The Deadweight-Loss 
In this paper, the DWL method of Daskin (1991) will use the elasticities estimated in equations (5.x) 
and (7.x). In theory, it is a demand with constant elasticity (isoelastic – price elasticity means of 2009-2016 
period) determined by: 

d =   𝛼4(1 −   𝑠𝑗𝑡

where Q is the quantity sold in industry, A (greater than zero) is a constant and ε is the absolute value of 
the price elasticity of demand. P is the price of the homogeneous product. Therefore, an industry with N 
firms, where qj is the quantity for the financial institution j. The profit of bank j is:

The  relationship  of  financial  institution  j  which  any  financial  institution  k,  shows  the  constant

 and replace it in equation (11) for obtain:

After a sequence of algebraic manipulations, we arrive at the equation (14) that can be rewriting in 

equation (15):

(14) 

(15) 

 
In equation (14), the sj is the share presented by equations (3.x) and |ϵ| is elasticity-price of demand. 

Remember that default Lerner Index is L= [P(Q)-C]/P(Q). Thus, the equation (15) can be rewriting in: 

 
𝑠𝑗(1− 𝛽𝑗)+𝛽𝑗

𝐿𝑗 = {

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(16) 

 
Equation (16) will be all the greater the greater the share of financial institution j. Intuitively, the 
DWL is the area whose producer surplus do not cover consumer surplus losses, when the firm increases 
your price. That is, the DWL is represented by the difference between the reduction in consumer surplus 
and the increase in producer surplus, when the producer ceases to be competitive and becomes a monopolist 
(HARBERGER, 1954). To calculate this area, we can use the integral presented by equation (18).

The  equation  (17)  have,  between  price  estimated  by  theoretical  Bertrand  and  price  estimated  by 
theoretical Cartel, in its first element, the consumer surplus (EC) and in the second element the producer 
surplus (EP). Assuming a Cobb Douglas demand, 𝐴𝑢−𝜀, and solving for it integral, we arrive at equation 
(18.2).

The total revenue is calculated for the entire industry (through the Cartel price) and the profit, πi, is 
the margin observed. The equation (23) is in generalized form, since it will only be used in segments that 
are  considered  cartelized  or  in  those  whose  observed  price  is  above  the  estimated  price  for  theoretical 
Bertrand. 

For  to  test  the  hypothesis  of  positive  relationship  between  market  power  and  price-elasticity  of 

demand in absolute term we will estimate the following equation: 

 
𝐿𝑚,𝑡 = 𝜀𝑚,𝑡 +   𝜇𝑚,𝑡 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(24) 

where L is Lerner index in county m in period t,  𝜀𝑚,𝑡 is the price-elasticity of demand of county m in time 
t and 𝜇𝑚,𝑡 is term of error. 
 

2.4. Econometric Procedures, Instruments and Controls 
Like Berry (1994), the demand equations 4.x and 6.x, will be estimated by Instrumental Variables 
(IV). If, the error correlation terms of equations 4.2 (6.2) and 4.3 (6.3) (TD and LO respectively) are strong 
enough, the procedure for the estimation will be via Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). However, 
if the correlation between two equations is not strong, then, in addition to the estimation by 2SLS, the Berry, 
Levinsohn and Pakes (BLP, 1995) procedure will be used.  

We also will perform the endogeneity tests, overidentification (Hansen J statistics) tests, unit-root 
(ADF – Augmented Dickey Fuller) testing and weak-instrument (Kleibergen-Paap F statistic) tests. Finally, 
we will perform the robust correction of the variance per cluster (microregions).  

The identification of demand is reached by variation in branch bank market shares controlled by 

variation in bank features. Thus, we decompose the optimal instruments into five groups: 

 
•  BLP_1: number of bank branches (all banks), number of specific branches and quantity of 

electronic service stations (ESS) – for all banks; 

•  BLP_2: interaction between the total cost of a bank branch and total number of ESS and the 

interaction between the added value of a specific bank branch and the total number of 
branches in a certain county; 
INT_1: interaction between debt index and total number of branches in a county, interaction 
between debt index and the quantity of specific bank branches, interaction between debt index 
and total number of ESSs; 
INT_2: ESS density, rival branch density, density of ESS rivals and branch density;

• 

• 

 

•  Shifter: liquidity index. 
We controlled the remuneration of deposits in determining bank in accordance with the Taylor’s 
rule, where the inflation gap is the distance between observed annual inflation and the center of its target, 
4,5%, and we considered the municipality output gap as the distance of observed output in period t and the 
largest output observed between 2009-2016 period. 

As in BLP procedure, restricting utility parameter to the segment features space and to a polynomial 
system is enough to identify the demand. This is important because the bank demand is a function of the 
features of all products and this invalidates our confidence in the “exclusion” constraint tests. 

The  Lerner-Demand  test  hypothesis  for  time  deposit  and  loans  will  be  performed  by  panel  with 
fixed effects. The panel season will be performed by time, because the relationship of banks in inter-finance 
market in these segments is a source of correlation for this estimate. Thus, we will analyze each Lerner 
index and price elasticities by time for whole banks presents in each county in determined time.  

Finally, if the GMM system will be necessary, the estimates are made with on-weight matrix for 
each micro-region and year and therefore, the restriction that the covariance between microregions is equal 
to zero is forced. 

 

3.  DATA

Tax3 on the CDI's profitability. In savings there is no incidence of income tax. The management fee (𝑝𝑗
represents the banks income to manages the “households” resources. It is a result of the division between 
the  accounts  71700009  and  41500002  of  the  balance  sheet  provided  by  report  4010  of  Central  Bank  of 
Brazil. The account services fees (𝑝𝑠𝑣) represent the average traded in the five working days before month 
end.  The  responsibility  for  information  lies  with  financial  institutions.  The  values  of  𝑝𝑠𝑣  are  the 
transformation of the available values for the logarithmic scale. 
 

4.  RESULTS 

4.1.Demand Analysis 
The  first  results  that  we  will  analyze  is  for  Time  Deposit  segments.  The  errors  between  savings 
deposit  and  time  deposit  were  considered  highly  correlated  (approximately  90%).  Thus,  the  estimated 
GMM system assumed the form of the system presented in equation (25). The nests desegregate up to six 
equations (three for SD and three for TD) totaling seven equations for model 2 and eleven for model 3.

In Table 3 the first and second columns are respectively the Logit and Nested Logit models (for 
multiple banks only). The third column presents the Nested Logit with three paths: public banks, private 
multiple  banks  and  private  commercial  banks.  In  addition  to  the  variables  presented,  controls  and 
instruments are also part of the regression (econometric procedure sections).

By results, the demand was identified and is statistically significant. The higher the management 
fee the lower the demand for time deposits. Note that given the existence of these management fees, when 
the difference between the yields of the CDI and the savings increases, the market share of the time deposits 
segment fall. This is because many of the large banks have paid 70 or even 60% of CDI's profitability to 
their applicators and there is still the incidence of Income Tax. Thus, the safe deposit is preferable to the 
time deposit.

The analysis of the coefficients of the management fees of the segment on the screen is only a prior 
one, since the consumers' sensitivity to the price also depends on the market share of each firm and the 
price charged by the financial institutions (since this is not in a logarithmic scale). The price elasticities of 
demand for the Time Deposit segment are presented in Table 4.

After analyzing the Mahalanobis distance, 1% of the elasticity of Bradescard bank was considered outlier, and therefore, 
although this bank is available in annex, the elasticities of the above Table did not consider it in the analysis. Elasticities are in 
absolute values.

From results, of Table 4, we have an elastic behavior of demand against management. The price 
elasticity of demand, in absolute value, distribution is asymmetric on the left, where the means values for 
two first models are concentrated between 25th and 50th percentiles. For 3 Nested Logit model the mean 
value is concentrated between 10th and 25th percentiles. 

The demand analysis for LO is presented in Table 5. The LO segment was performed by BLP. At 
first glance all validity tests of the instruments were rejected, however, such rejection occurred due to the 
number of observations.

The split of the value of this test (of all models) by the number of observations (OVER / N) shows 
that the correlations between second stage residuals and the instruments used are less than 1%. The random 
component of GLP was not statistically significant, indicating that local managers do not have much order 
to  decide  on  interest  rates.  Interest  rates  presented  negative  coefficients,  indicating  that  the  higher  the 
interest rates, the lower the demand for bank loans and, consequently, the lower the market share of banks 
(demand identification). 

The distribution of the absolute elasticities for the LO Segment (Table 6) is asymmetric to the right 

for all three estimated models.

Considering  the  first  model  of  the  five  largest  banks,  Bradesco's  demand  is  the  most  elastic  and 
belongs to the range of 75% to 90%. The price elasticity of the demand of banks Itaú-Unibanco, Santander, 
Caixa Econômica Federal and Banco do Brazil are between the 50% and 75% percentiles. 

 
4.2.Deadweight-loss Analysis 
In this part, we will use the elasticities-price of demand in equation (24) to obtain the DWL measure 
for TD and LO segments. We also present the hypothesis for both segments of the relationship between 
market power and price elasticity of demand. The DWL comparison will be made with GDP and the sums 
of profit of  five largest  downstream  banks. While most of European banks are stuck in  single digits, in 

10 

 

Brazil the return on equity (a measure of profitability) are of two-digit percentage (The Economist, 2018). 
In our analysis, the average firm surplus of five largest banks, in three segments, was nearly $31.61 Billion.  
In Table 7, we presented the results of Loans and Time Deposits deadweight-loss. The presentation 
of segments was analyzed in each line of the first column. In the second column, we presented the number 
of banks analyzed. The deadweight-loss is presented in millions of dollars in the third column. The Brazilian 
GDP means between 2009-2016 is presented in the fourth column. In fifth column is the DLW as percentage 
of GDP.

The as ratio of DWL with respect of average GDP for a Time Deposit segment was not negligible. 
On  average,  annually,  over  one  and  a  half  billion  ceases  to  be  applied  because  banks  conduct  in  this 
segment.  This  ratio  represents  between  0.05%  to  0.11%  of  Brazil's  average  GDP  (2009-2016)  or 
approximately  between  3.26%  to  6.90%  of  average  total  revenue  of  banks  in  this  segment.  The  Loans 
segment showed a greater gain in the deadweight-loss measures. Again, the values of the Deadweight are 
not negligible and indicate that approximately $7.0 billion are no longer undertaken annually due to the 
interest charged by financial institutions. This ratio represents an annual average between 0.24% to 0.31% 
of the average GDP or between 3.26% to 6.90% average total revenue of banks in this segment. The values 
presented  in  Table  7  are  a  median  basis,  however  the  distribution  of  elasticities  presented  in  demand 
analysis  are  asymmetric  to  right  for  a  Loans  segment  and  to  left  for  Time  Deposit  segment  and  each 
municipality can be a different price elasticity of demand. 

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the DWL (principal axis) when the price elasticity of demand, in 
TD  segment,  increases  (black  line).  The  value  of  elasticities  is  for  the  third  model.  The  secondary  axis 
allows analyzing the relationship between the number of banks in each municipality and the price elasticity 
of demand of these municipalities. The rings are each county and itss positions is with relation to number 
of banks. Remember that price-elasticity of demand in TD segment is normalized for 100 thousand people.

The optimal elasticity, in TD segment, occurs when the bank has inelastic demand. Most counties 
have a close elasticity between 2 and 2.5 (mean = median) with several banks ranging from 1 to 8 different 
brands.  In  these  counties,  the  DWL  value  to  go  between  $1,000  and  $1,800  million  of  dollar.  Few 
municipalities are on the competitive margins  (they  present  a peculiarity to save  regardless of the  yield 
proposed by the banks). 

In  Figure 2,  we have the evolution  of the DWL for  LO segment.  Its  analysis  is  the same that in 
previous figure.  In the case of banks, what  is  not  lent to  the households  or firms  can be directed  to  the 
government financing that in the period presented expenses growing.

Note that the second order condition of DWL in Figure 2 is greater than zero and that it does not 
have a point that touches the competitive market structure. Therefore, given the current characteristics of 
the Brazilian banks elasticity, it seems difficult to say that the lending segment is a competitive segment, 
as Nakane (2001) stated.

In addition, Figure 2 also reveals that in most counties have, on average, three brands of banks and 
that these municipalities have as characterizing an elasticity that orbits between 3.05 and 3.10. In this point, 
the DWL represents about 0.18% of Brazilian GDP (Table 7). This is different of ratio presented  in the 
median value (Table 7) and indicates that DWL can be at least $1B larger. 

We will present the hypothesis test of the relationship between market power and price elasticities 

of demand in Table 8. We perform the test for third model (Three nested logit).

In loans analysis, we have an unbalanced panel for time with 3,493 counties and in the time 

deposit segment we also have unbalanced panel fort time with 3,435 counties. The results indicate us, for 
both segments, that our hypothesis holds and the relationship between the Lerner index and price 
elasticities of demand is positive. 

The evolution of elasticity per year for the Time Deposit segment for whole of Brazil and itss five 
regions is in Figure 3. We use the third Model of elasticities to present these evolutions. The behavior of 
the elasticities does not change through the models, what changes are only the value of the elasticities. The 
five regions present a behavior different from Brazil. The elasticities increase over time, but in non-linear 
behavior.

In  northwest  region,  the  increase  of  elasticity  of  time  deposit  bank  demand  represents  a  relative 
reduction  in  the  market  power  of  banks  in  this  sector.  The  emergence  of  other  source  of  financial 
investments  like  increase  of  BM&F  Bovespa  participations  or  forex  applications  may  responds  these 
variations.  However,  it  is  a  source  for  another  analyzes.  The  same  question  may  be  applied  in  another 
regions, but the increase of elasticity around the period is not a clear like in the northwest region., 

The evolution of elasticity per year for the Loans segment for whole of Brazil and the five regions 
can be followed in Figure 4. In this segment, the five regions present a same behavior from Brazil. The 
elasticities increase over time.

In Panel  A of Figure 5  we can see the relationship  presented in  Figure  4. The region  with  more 
elastic  demand  of  Brazil  is  southeast  and  south.  In  these  regions  there  is  also  a  greater  banking 
concentration.  The  appeal  for  competition  is  greater  and  the  existence  of  surrogates  as  well.  This 
relationship shows the effectiveness of financial intermediation for local development. As an example of 
interpretation  of  Figure  5,  the  counties  of  the  northeast  that  do  not  have  banks  are  those  located  in  the 
northwest  of  Bahia  and,  south  of  Piauí.  The  hinterland  of  this  region  is  the  one  with  the  lowest  elastic 
demand, while the coastal region has a greater sensitivity to the variation of interest rates. 

The results of Panel B of Figure 4 follow the Panel A in places of demand relations. However, the 
distribution of elasticities intervals is the most homogenous between the five regions. Note, in figure 3, that 
the increase occurs in a small relative interval. The cost region has a more elastic demand, mainly in south, 
southeast regions and the Distrito Federal in Midwest region.

Our result is in line with those found by Maudos and Guevara (2007) for EU-15 countries (0,42% 
in the Brazilian case against 0.52% for European banks). However, our values are relatively higher than 
those found for Mexico by Solis & Maudos (2008). Silva and Lucinda (2017) shows that switching cost 
average duration between the bank and costumer is about 12.2 years.  Thus, the Lerner-Demand hypothesis 
indicates that an increase of competition endogenously, with increase of credit without political interest, 
may to redistribute the demand between the firms, because the price elasticity of the market is limited by 
price elasticity of demand and to reduce the lock-in time between bank and costumer or to reduce the cost 
of this lock-in effect. As Cardozo, Azevedo and Barboza (2018) show, an increase in bank competition is 
associated  with  a  greater  supply  of  credit.  In  line  with  our  results,  this  greater  credit  supply  means  a 
reduction of the social expectative here verified, since more projects will be approved. This relationship

may  be  capable  of  generating  new  jobs,  taxes  for  the  government  and  feasibility  of  projects  in  various 
regions of Brazil. 

 

5.  CONCLUDS 

The financial intermediary sector has big importance for developing country. The main theories and 
hypotheses of literature seek to analyze the bank market from financial optics. However, bank does not is 
a regular firm because there is the social expectation under efficiency in its function of intermediation. At 
this point we raise the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between market power and the demand 
behaviors, and we draw the objective of measuring the size of the deadweight-loss generated annually by 
the conduct of the Brazilian banks. In short, our objective was to measure the size of the Dead Weight-loss 
generated annually by the conduct of the Brazilian banks. 

Our  results  indicate  that  DWL  practice  is  maintained  in  practically  all  counties  to  which  banks 
operate. There were 3435 counties analyzed for the Time Deposit segment and 3493 counties for the Loans 
segment.  The  results  indicate  that  the  deadweight  loss  is  around  0.5%  and  0.11%  of  the  average  Gross 
Domestic Product of the period 2009 and 2016 for the term deposit segment and between 0.24% and 0.31% 
of GDP for the loans segment in the same period. In all segments, Brazil ceases to produce around $8 to 
$12  billion  of  Dollars  annually  because  of  the  conduct  of  the  banks.  Thus,  we  do  not  refute  our  initial 
hypotheses that DWL is not significant to test the Lerner-Elasticity relationship.  

This  study provides insights  in  terms of social,  financial and economic implications. Our results 
indicate that in the period the conduct of banks was in elastic part of demand for almost all counties of 
analyzes in both segments (deposits and loans). This is evidence that Lerner-Elasticity hypothesis is true, 
but nothing talks about efficiency, and capacity of generating profit in the period. Therefore, it is advisable 
that  policy  makers  should  concentrate  on  possible  market  fail  generated  by  conduct  of  commercial  and 
multiple banks. Thus, for continuity of this research, we recommend the test of efficiency, allocative and 
scale of banks from Relative Market Power Hypothesis.
