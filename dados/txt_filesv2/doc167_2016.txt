Abstract. The debate on Brazil's innovation performance has given little attention to the 
role of geography. Based on the broader literature about geography of innovation, this 
paper  addresses  this  gap,  applying  knowledge  function  approach  in  two  levels  to 
examine  the  effects  of  the  territorial  factors  on  innovation  in  Brazil.  The  empirical 
results  suggest  that  the  territorial  factors  are  strong  predictors  of  innovation 
performance,  even  in  developing  and  emerging  countries,  such  as  Brazil,  where 
innovations  tend  to  be  mostly  new  to  the  firm,  whereas  a  larger  proportion  of 
innovations  in  advanced  economies  is  new  to  the  world  as  a  whole.  In  particular,  the 
availability  of  skilled  labour,  the  economic  agglomeration  and  the  specialization  have 
played  a  fundamental  role  to  foster  degree  of  novelty  of  the  innovation  on  Brazil, 
whereas the spillovers or population agglomeration have no significance.

Territorial aspects of the degree of novelty of the innovation in Brazil 

 

Abstract. The debate on Brazil's innovation performance has given little attention to the 
role of geography. Based on the broader literature about geography of innovation, this 
paper  addresses  this  gap,  applying  knowledge  function  approach  in  two  levels  to 
examine  the  effects  of  the  territorial  factors  on  innovation  in  Brazil.  The  empirical 
results  suggest  that  the  territorial  factors  are  strong  predictors  of  innovation 
performance,  even  in  developing  and  emerging  countries,  such  as  Brazil,  where 
innovations  tend  to  be  mostly  new  to  the  firm,  whereas  a  larger  proportion  of 
innovations  in  advanced  economies  is  new  to  the  world  as  a  whole.  In  particular,  the 
availability  of  skilled  labour,  the  economic  agglomeration  and  the  specialization  have 
played  a  fundamental  role  to  foster  degree  of  novelty  of  the  innovation  on  Brazil, 
whereas the spillovers or population agglomeration have no significance.  

1. Introduction 

This  paper  investigates  empirically  how  locational  factors  affect  degree  of  novelty  of 
the innovation in Brazil.  The aim is to deepen and, at the same time, complement the 
discussion  of  how  regional  specificities  factors  in  which  the  firm  is  part  can  generate 
innovative  differential  to  them.  That  is,  as  firms  similar  in  some  aspects  may  differ 
degree  of  novelty  degree  of  novelty  due  to  its  location.  The  main  hypothesis  of  this 
study  is  that  regional  characteristics,  such  as  knowledge  spillovers,  agglomeration, 
regional  production  structure  and  the  availability  of  local  resources  can  affect 
innovation.  

The  ability  of  firms  to  innovate  is  the  subject  of  several  studies  in  recent  years.  The 
literature  suggests  that  innovation  is  highly  related  to  the  ability  that  firms  have  to 
absorb and transform the resources related to knowledge. These capabilities are closely 
linked  to  the  firms’  financial  and  human  resources  and  its  internal  organization.  In 
addition,  external  factors,  such  as  production  structure  and  knowledge  spillovers,  can 
also  affect  innovative  performance  of  the  firm.  It  should  be  noted  that  knowledge, 
especially  tacit  knowledge,  is  an  important  factor  of  the  geography  of  innovation. 
Knowledge is largely tied to the perception of those who transfer and those who receive, 
so  that  the  proximity  between  the  agents  tend  to  facilitate  the  acquisition  and 
dissemination  of  knowledge  and  thus  innovation.  Locational  factors  can  also  affect 
innovation, as several studies pointed it out. Empirical studies have proposed indicators 
of production and innovation to analyse the relations between innovation and territory.

Econometric analysis of the relation between regional characteristics and innovation is 
widespread  and  widely  discussed.  However,  these  studies  focus  on  analysing  the 
importance of the location of firm in aggregated form. This paper tries to contribute by 
using the knowledge production function to correlate innovative inputs at the firm and 
regional levels and the results of innovation at the firm level, thus making it possible to 
examine how local factors affect innovation in Brazil.   

Therefore, this paper can be able to advance the debate on innovation in Brazil in two 
specific  dimensions.  The  first  relates  to  the  understanding  of  how  the  features  and 
characteristics  of  firms  influence  their  innovations.  The  second  is  focused  on 
understanding  how  the  territorial  factors  can  shape  the  innovation  process.  Thus,  this 
study  can be able to  advance in  the small but  growing debate on economic geography 
about the dynamics of innovation in emerging countries, as Brazil. 

2. Background 

The relationship between innovation and geography has been studied by several authors 
in  different  contexts  (JAFFE  et  al.,  1993;  FELDMAN  and  AUDRETSCH,  1996; 
CARLINO et al, 2007; CRESCENZI et al., 2007). In general, the main assumption for 
the  importance  of  geography  lies  in  the  fact  that  the  knowledge,  main  input  of 
innovation, often requires spatial proximity to be better understood and shared.  This is 
because  the  knowledge,  especially  the  tacit,  is  conditioned  to  the  perception  and 
awareness  of  receiver  and  transmitter.  Thus,  the  proximity  between  the  agents  can 
facilitate  the  assimilation  of  tacit  and  complex  knowledge,  that  would  otherwise  be 
impossible  and  very  expensive  to  encode  (POLANYI,  1966;  MARSKELL  and 
MALMBERG,  1999;  STORPER  and  VENABLES,  2004;  BRESCHI  and  LISSONI, 
2001; GERTLER, 2007). In this sense, the innovation process is characterized by severe 
degrees of division of labour and knowledge flows that are more easily accessible in a 
locality  where  the  actors  interact  more  frequently  and  have  direct  contacts.  Therefore, 
the  innovative  activities  are  strongly  influenced  by  local  context.  Thus,  in  certain 
circumstances, a location can enhance or limit the innovative results of the firms.  

Although it is understood that the mere exposure to knowledge does not guarantee that 
the firm will innovate, it is emphasized that the concentration of agents tends to increase 
possibilities  for  combination  and  lower  costs  of  knowledge  exchange  which  make 
individuals  (firms)  more  productive  and  innovative  than  in  other  places.  Thus,  the 
literature points out that even within regions that spend the same amount on R&D, the 
innovation  levels  may  differ,  especially  when  they  have  different  degrees  of 
agglomeration. In other words, a "critical mass" of agglomeration is necessary in order 
to  expect  substantial  local  economic  effects  of  the  innovation  efforts  (AUDRETSCH 
and FELDMAN, 1996; VARGA, 2000; DURANTON and PUGA, 2001; CARLINO et 
al., 2007).  Thus, it is expected that firms inserted in drivers centres of innovation enjoy 
advantages  in  comparison  with  firms  in  other  regions.  This  explains  the  perpetuation 
and  deepening  of  geographic  concentration  in  the  world  of  expanding  markets, 
weakened barriers and sharper and inexpensive communication technology. 

The  importance  of  local  agglomerations  was  initially  treated  in  Marshall's  work.  For 
Marshall  (1920)  the  spatial  concentration  of  firms  is  justified  by  the  easy  access  to  a 

3 

 

range of benefits that are important to increase market competitiveness of these firms. It 
is  argued  that  the  agglomeration  of  firms  in  the  same  industry  generate  a  demand  for 
skilled  labour  to  the  specific  activity  of  the  industry.  This  demand  promotes  the 
attraction of skilled workers in anticipation of better jobs and wages, for example. The 
concentration of skilled labour generates a space of constant learning of new knowledge 
that can give conditions for the occurrence of innovations that spillover to other firms. 
However, the externalities are limited in space promoting agglomeration. Thus, there is 
a  circular  causality  between  the  concentration  and  its  externalities,  since  the  spatial 
concentration of activities in space generates benefits to firms that in turn tend to attract 
more firms to  the  region leading to more concentration in  space  (MARSHALL, 1920; 
JAFFE  et  al.,  1993;  AUDRETSCH  and  FELDMAN,  1996;  ROSENTHAL  and 
STRANGE,  2001;  CARLINO  et  al.,  2007;  VARGA,  2000;  FRITSCH  and 
SLAVTCHEV, 2010).  

In  this  context,  knowledge  spillovers  are  seen  as  an  important  element  that  reinforces 
the  importance  of  local  context  appropriate  for  innovation.  That  is,  important  portions 
of the knowledge generated in the firms go beyond their limits and become available to 
other  agents  in  surroundings.  In  this  sense,  through  knowledge  spillovers,  the  firms' 
innovation efforts may end up benefiting the innovative activities of all agents nearby. 
Similarly, the new knowledge generated in the local is more accessible to local agents. 
Thus, if firms have the ability to take ownership of knowledge from different sources, 
the  knowledge  spillovers  become  an  essential  source  of  knowledge  for  innovation 
(COHEN and LEVINTHAL, 1990; BRESCHI and LISSONI, 2001; AUDRETSCH and 
FELDMAN, 2003). 

However, on industrial context of innovation, agglomerations and its externalities, two 
distinct views emerge. On the one hand, there are those who argue that the interactions 
between  firms  and  individuals  of  similar  skills  and  that  respond  to  common  concerns 
that  generate  the  externalities.  These  advantages  stems  from  the  fact  that  specialized 
regions  in  a particular industry enjoy benefits  originating in  the expertise of suppliers, 
the existence of skilled labour on site and the availability of knowledge involved in the 
innovation  process.  Thus,  the  interactions  between  agents  and  skills  providers  and 
workers  endow  firms  in  specialized  areas  conditions  to  develop  their  activities  more 
efficiently  and  even  better  carry  out  of  innovative  activities  than  their  competitors 
elsewhere.  Therefore,  it  is  the  specialization  of  agents  that  ensure  externalities  that 
support  innovation,  commonly  called  Marshallian  advantages  in  view  of  the  seminal 
work of Marshall  (1920)1.  

On  the  other  hand,  backed  by  Jacobs's  work,  there  are  researchers  that  claim  that  the 
variety of industries located near each other in a region is what supports the innovation 
and  growth,  generally  referred  to  as  Jacobian  externalities.  In  this  way,  it  is  the 
proximity  of  diverse  and  distinct  industries,  not  specific,  that  promotes  imitation  and 
fosters  sharing  and  recombination  of  ideas  and  complementary  practices  between 

                                                           

1  Also  called  by  the  acronym  MAR  due  to  the  work  Marshall,  Arrow  and  Romer  that  dealt  with  the 
importance of spillovers between firms in the same sector

agents.  Therefore,  the  diversification  is  most  important  in  this  process.  Thus, 
innovations  are  associated  with  exchanges  of  knowledge  between  agents  in  different 
sectors. 

The  empirical  literature  provides  evidence  supporting  both  theories.  The  studies  by 
Audretsch  and  Feldman  (1999)  and  Carlino  et  al.  (2001)  for  American  regions,  Van 
Oort et al. (2002) for Netherlands regions, Co (2002), Fritsch and Slavtchev (2010) for 
German  regions,  highlight  the  benefits  of  diversity  to  promote  the  innovation. 
Furthermore,  according  to  the  authors,  specialized  agglomeration  can  be  harmful 
innovation,  since  it  can  lead  to  lock-in,  preventing  the  emergence  and  development  in 
other essential areas to innovation. In contrast, Henderson (1999) to the United States, 
Van der Panne (2004) for the Netherlands, Cabrer-Borrás and Serrano (2007) for Spain 
and Crescenzi et al (2012) for Chinese's regions, emphasize that it is more important the 
industrial  specialization  in  the  regions  to  foster  innovation,  therefore,  the  performance 
of  innovative  regions  depends  on  the  specialization  of  its  scientific  and  technological 
base. Joint evidence for both types of production structure have also been found by Paci 
and  Usai  (1999,  2000)  and  Greunz  (2004)  that  point  out  that  regional  innovation  is 
affected  positively  by  both  externalities  (specialization  and  diversification).  Thus,  the 
best  production structure (industry) that supports  innovation  can differ from  one place 
to another. 

In  short,  capacity  that  firms  have  to  innovate  is  determined  by  its  accumulated 
knowledge  generated  from  past  activities,  coming  from  R&D  efforts,  human  capital, 
organizational structure and environment. This is, the firms' internal efforts that enables 
them  realize  and  take  advantage  of  new  knowledge,  providing  them  competitive 
advantage. Furthermore, it depends on a number of external factors that may or may not 
accelerate  innovation.  In  other  words,  firms  do  not  innovate  just  with  their  internal 
resources,  but  also  depend  on  the  availability  of  a  set  of  factors  that  may  or  may  not 
speed  up  innovation.  Therefore,  innovation  should  not  occur  in  the  same  way 
everywhere,  usually  with  heavy  reliance  of  the  surroundings  where  the  company  is 
located. 

3. Empirical Model 

3.1 Data 

To  examine  how  the  territorial  factors  affect  innovation  in  Brazil,  a  specific  data  set, 
with 7,145 firms, derived mainly from two data sources is exploited.  

First,  the  firm-level  data  was  gathered  from  the  Innovation  Research  in  Brazil 
(PINTEC2)  which  is  conducted  by  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics 
(IBGE).  This  data  set,  according  to  the  IBGE,  is  a  cross  survey  that  covers  the 

                                                           

2     The  IBGE  conducted  and  published  a  total  of  five  editions  of  Innovation  Research,  which  were 
PINTEC 2000 that covers the triennium 1998-2000, PINTEC 2003 (triennium 2001-2003), PINTEC 2005 
(triennium 2003-2005), PINTEC 2008 (triennium 2006-2008) and PINTEC 2011 (triennium 2009-2011).

information  about  activities  of  innovation  in  Brazil,  such  as  expenditure,  sources  of 
financing, the impact of innovations. Second, the regional-level data was collected from 
the Annual  Report on Social  Information  (RAIS) of the Ministry of  Labour. This  data 
set  contains  the  register  of  all  establishments  and  its  employees,  which  allows 
constructing regional variables.  This register is also used at the firm level to allocate a 
region (city or micro-region) to a firm (using code of the firm headquarters identifier), 
since PINTEC data does not allow to identify firm location. 

For this research, it was used PINTEC and RAIS 2008, and PINTEC 2011. So, it was 
studied in  this  work only  the firms  present  in  both  PINTEC surveys. The main reason 
for  the  use  of  both  surveys  is  the  fact  that  innovative  efforts  (inputs)  do  not  translate 
into innovation output straightaway, requiring some period.  In this sense, the PINTEC 
2011 is used as innovation outputs, while the PINTEC 2008 and RAIS 2008 are used as 
inputs3. 

3.2 Dependent variable. 

A cross-section is estimated for 2008- 2011 on this data set to examine how the firms' 
innovation capacity can be affected by your location in Brazil. 

The firms innovation capacity (INNOVi,T) is the dependent variable which is an ordinal 
variable that takes value 1 if the firm did not innovate; 2 if the firm introduced product 
and/or process new for the firm, but existing in the domestic market; value 3 if the firm 
introduced  product  and/or  process  new  for  the  national  market;  and  value  4  if  the 
product and/or process is new for the world market.

3     It should be pointed out that time references are made of different ways for the different variables. In 
general,  the  variables  which  do  not  involve  value  record  are  accounted  in  three  consecutive  years,  i.e, 
from 2006 to 2008 for PINTEC 2008 and from 2009 to 2011 for PINTEC 2011. Variables with value are 
measured in the last year of the reference of the survey.

Figure  1  illustrates  the  innovation  in  Brazil.  What  stands  out  in  Figure  1  is  the  low 
number  of  firms  that  have  introduced  innovations,  for  the  world  market  only  3%  the 
total  firms.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  a  high  number  of  firms  that  did  not  present 
innovations. This shows the low level of innovation in Brazil.  

Figure  2  shows  the  distribution  of  innovation  in  Brazil.  Similar  to  those  of  other 
countries, Brazil's regions differ significantly in terms of their distribution of innovation 
capabilities. The distribution of innovation exhibits a tendency towards concentration in 
south and southeast regions, also the most developed regions. In 2011, 40% of all firms 
that  introduced  innovation  (new  for  firms,  domestic  market  or  world  market)  were  in 
São Paulo state (or Federative Unit  – UF), followed by Rio Grande do Sul, with 11%, 
Santa  Catarina  and  Minas  Gerais,  both  with  9%, Paraná,  with  8%  and  Rio  de Janeiro, 
with  6%.  These  six  UF  alone  compose  almost  85  %  of  the  complete  of  innovation 
numbers in Brazil that features 27 UFs.

The innovation, like all complex reality, depends on a wide range of factors that enable 
this process to be successful or not. In Brazil, this is not different, thus the reasons for 
the  low  innovative  dynamism  can  be  several.  Among  them,  we  can  point  the  weak 
engagement  of  firms  in  technological  activities,  particularly  in  Research  and 
Development (R&D). In contrast to what is seen in other countries, the universities, not 
the firms, which account for most of the expenditure on R&D and employ scientists and 

 

7 

engineers.  In  addition,  the  competitive  conditions  in  the  economy  combined  the 
heterogeneity  of  Brazilian  regions  also  affect  technological  activities.  Looking  at 
innovation from the point of view of location, the drives are diverse and can vary. It is 
for  this  reason  that  several  works,  like  this,  are  seeking  to  understand  how  and  why 
different local factors can make firms more prone to innovate.  

3.3 Explanatory Variables. 

It is possible to divide the independent variables into two levels: region and firm. At the 
level  of  the  region,  the  main  focus  of  this  paper,  four  are  the  characteristics  of  the 
regions that are studied. 

The first characteristics is knowledge spillovers - WRDi,T-t. The literature suggests that 
the  R&D  efforts  not  only  increase  the  capacity  to  generate  new  knowledge,  as  also,  it 
can give them the ability to internalize knowledge from other sources. In this sense, if 
the firms have this capability, the knowledge spillovers can represent an important input 
of your innovative activity4. To measure the knowledge spillovers it was used the sum 
of innovation  efforts  in  the city  where  the firm  is located, except  innovation efforts  of 
firm itself. 

The  second  characteristic  is  agglomeration.  We  use  two  agglomerations:  population 
and/or  economic.  The  degree  of  local  agglomeration  is  proxied  by  the  population 
density  -AggPi,T-t,  as  customary  in  the  literature.  In  addition,  the  degree  of  economic 
agglomeration is proxied by the GPD per capita of the firm's city - AggEi,T-t. 

The third variable is  the productive structure of  the region  in  which the  firms  operate, 
5.  This  variable  captures  the  degree  of  local  specialization  or  diversification 
Kindexi,T-t
where  the  firm  is  located.  To  do  this,  it  is  used the  Krugman  index,  calculated  in  two 
ways: first by the number of employees in the manufacturing in the regions - KindexM, 
and  the  second  by  the  number  of  employees  in  all  sectors  in  KindexT  regions.  The 
Krugman index is calculated as follows: 

 

k is part of a sector k in the region i on all firms in this region and νi,T-t

-k is part 
Thus, νi,T-t
of  the  same  industry  of  all  other  different  regions  of  i  divided  by  all  firms  of  other 
regions  of  different  i.  The  index  has  a  value  close  to  zero  if  the  micro-region  is  more

5 It should be pointed out that unlike other regional variables this variable is calculated for micro-regions, 
and not city, since that indicator is the better represented at this level.

to assess whether there is a different impact on the ability to innovate in  firms located 
on regions with specialized or diversified productive structure. 

Rounding  out  the  list  of  variables  at  the  region  level  there  is  an  indicator  that  aims  to 
capture the structure of productive resources available in firm's city, named Social Filter 
Index - SFi,T-t, as Crescenzi et al, 2007 and 2012. The Social Filter Index is constructed 
through Principal Component Analysis (PCA)6 of the individual variables that represent 
the  labour  force  employed  in  firm's  city  and  that  should  make  a  firm  more  or  less 
innovation prone. The individual variables are:  

 the  qualification  of  employees  measured  by  share  of  the  labour  force  who  have 
completed tertiary education (include masters and PhDs) in firm's city -Educ.  

 the  resources  in  Science  and  Technology  measure  by  percentage  the  labour  force 
employed in technological and science occupations in firm's city- ST7. 

  the demographic structure of employment measured by share of employees who are 
age between 15 and 24 in firm's city - Age. 

The combination of individual variables into one single composite indicator (the 'Social 
Filter  Index')  develops  a  quantitative  variable  of  the  local  structure  of  labour  force, 
making  it  possible  to  compare  the  social  filter  conditions  of  different  regions.  We  use 
the  first  principal  component.  All  the  variables  enter  the  first  principal  component, 
which  explain  46%  of  variation  in  the  variables  with  the  expected  sign.  The  tertiary 
education  and  S&T  variables  are  positively  associated  with  the  composite  social  filter 
variable, while the percentage of  young  employees has the negative sign. The level  of 
educational  attainment  of  the  employees  has  the  strongest  association  with  the 
composite variable whereas the weakest is related to the percentage of young employees 
(Appendix A). 

Regarding at the level of the firm, we employ a number of control variables which are 
correlated with the creation of knowledge and thus with innovation. The first variable is 
the  innovation  efforts  -  RDi,T-t  that  represent  total  (internal  and  external)  R&D 
expenditure.  This  variable  is  measure  by  the  sum  R&D  expenditure  divided  by  gross 
sale. 

The  second  variable  is  the  size  of  the  firm-  Sizei,T-t.  This  variable  allows  capturing 
differentials generated by more staff which can raise the possibility of combinations of 
knowledge. 

                                                           

6    The Principal Component Analysis is a technique which combines measures in a non-correlated order 
of importance, and describes the data variation. 
7    The data were selected from the 2002 Brazilian classification of Occupations (CBO2002) at subgroup 
level: 20-Polyscientific Researchers and Professionals; 21-Professionals in the exact sciences, physics and 
engineering; and 22-Professionals in the biological sciences, health and related.

The  third  variable  is  the  measure  of  productivity  of  the  firm  -  Prodi,t-T.  As  shown  by 
Cohen and Levithal (1990) and Teece and Pisano (1994) innovations are dependent on 
the trajectory of accumulation of firms, thus enabling differentiated gains. In this sense, 
this variable is measured by industrial added value divided by total employees. 

The  fourth,  fifth,  sixth  and  seventh  variables  are  dummies  to  control  regions,  sector, 
collaborations  and  capital  origin.  So,  Colli,t-T,  the  fourth  variable,  is  a  measure  of 
collaboration  between  the  agents  involved  in  the  innovation  process.  According  to 
Teese  and  Pisano  (1994),  collaborations  and  partnerships  can  be  a  vehicle  to  learning 
for the firm. Thus, this variable assumes binary value, 1 if the firm has been involved in 
cooperative  arrangements  with  other(s)  organization(s)  for  developing  innovative 
activities and zero otherwise. 

The  fifth  variable  is  CCOi,t-T    that  control  specificities  of  the  firm's  controlling  capital 
origin,  and  assumes  value  1  if  the  firm's  controlling  capital  is  national;  2  if  firm's 
controlling capital is foreign; and 3 if firm's controlling capital is both. 

The sixth variable is industry dummy - Sectori,t-T that controls the idiosyncrasies of each 
sector  that  may  affect  the  ability  of  firms  to  innovate.  To  select  the  sector  we  used 
Castellacci typology and added the extractive industry. 

Finally,  the  seventh  variable  at  the  firm  level  is  the  firm's  macro-region  -  MacroRi,t-T 
which controls the idiosyncrasies of each region. 

Thus, the model in this work can be represented by the following form:

The  results  are  presented  in  Tables  1  and  2.  Table  1  gives  the  main  results.  In  the 
estimates (1) through (6) each territorial factor was included singly. In the estimates (I) 
through  (VI)  are  exhibited  full  models  for  different  agglomeration  and  specialization 
index. On Table 2 the social filter index is decomposed into its constituent elements and 
include in the full models (I' to VI' estimation).

In  general,  the  results  show  three  territorial  factors  that  affect  innovation  positively, 
while others factors have no significance.  

Specifically, the coefficient R&D spillover (WRD) is not significant. Although nothing 
can be said of the relationship between spillovers and innovation in Brazil, it should be 
pointed  out  that  this  result  is  inconsistent  with  the  primary  conceptual  assumptions 
presented  on  the  discussion  which  firms  tend  to  take  advantage  of  spillovers  to 
innovate. We can point to two possibilities for this result. First, the innovative efforts of 
neighbour'  firms  are  not  potential  inputs  for  innovation,  since  there  are  low  amounts 
spent  on  R&D  by  firms  in  Brazil.  Second,  it  is  that  the  level  of  aggregation  used  to 
capture the spillovers is unable to measure them.  

Looking  at  the  role  of  agglomeration  effects,  the  coefficient  economic  agglomeration 
(AggE)  is  positive  and  significant  in  almost  all  estimations,  while  the  coefficient  of 
population  agglomeration  (AggP)  is  positive  and  significant  only  singly.    This  result 
shows that firms located in economically dense regions are more likely to innovate than 
firms  located  elsewhere.  Differently,  the  population  density  does  not  emerge  as  a 
differential innovative factor. Possibly, in a context of low labour mobility and skill as 
in  the  Brazil  the  local  interaction  density  (population  density)  does  not  seem  to 
stimulate  innovation  while  the  relative  concentration  of  wealth  can  be  a  differential 
source of competitive advantage for firms to promote innovation. 

This  result  is  reinforced  when  looking  that  the  social  filter  coefficient  is  positive  and 
significant.  This  is,  the  local  structure  of  productive  resources  seems  to  play  an 
important role in explaining differential innovative performance of firms. This suggests 
the  combination  the  resources  available  give  a  synergy  that  contributes  to  innovation. 
More specifically, the firms that are in areas with firms with more share of employees of 
higher  education  and  in  S&T  activity  and  less  young  employees  are  more  likely  to 
innovate  than  others.  In  light  of  these  results,  it  can  be  said  that  the  agglomeration, 
through  the  more  availability  of  inputs,  encourages  the  flow  of  ideas  that  stimulate 
innovative activities, but is  the best  qualification of the individuals that tends to  make 
the  firms  more  prone  to  innovate,  since  increasing  individual  skills  tends  to  raise  the 
skill  that the firm  has to recognize the value of  knowledge, assimilate them  and apply 
them  for  commercial  purposes,  to  innovate.  So,  it  is  not  enough  to  have  the  resource 
available, the innovation needs skilful resources available. 

Finally,  only  the  coefficient  for  the  Krugman  Index  in  all  sectors  (KindexT)  has  a 
positive  and  significance  connection  to  innovation.  This  denotes  that,  based  on  all 
sectors, the firms are more innovative in regions that have more specialized production 
structures.  Regarding  the  productive  structure  based  on  manufacturing,  diversification 
or specialization is not correlated with innovation. 

The coefficients for firm level variables, in general, are positive and significant, except 
CCO_B,  in  all  specifications.  This  demonstrates  the  strong  relationship  between 
innovation  and  firms  characteristics,  as  pointed  out  by  several  authors  (POLANYI, 
1966;  NELSON  and  WINTER,  1982;  COHEN  and  LEVINTHAL,  1990;  TEECE  and 
PISANO,  1994;  AUDRETSCH,  1998;  PENROSE,  2006).    In  particular,  we  find  that 
firms that collaborate (Coll) with others agents are more innovation prone than the ones 

16 

 

that do not. Besides, the greater is the chance to innovate when the firm is controlled by 
foreign capital (CCO_F) than national. Regarding R&D investment (RD), as expected, 
there is positive and significant relationship with innovation, reaffirming that firms are 
more  likely  to  innovate  when  making  greater  efforts  in  R&D.  In  additional,  the  larger 
firms and more productivity are more innovative. 

When  the  individual  components  of  the  social  filter  are  assessed  separately,  the 
significant  and  positive  effect  of  higher  education  (Educ)  and  S&T  variable  (ST)  is 
apparent,  while  young  employees  (Age)  are  insignificant.  Therefore,  it  is  not  just  the 
joint effect of the components of the social filter that is powerful, but also the individual 
components.  This  results  show  that  factors  such  as  high  levels  of  education  of 
employees and employment in S&T, taken individually, have an important influence on 
innovation. From the inspection of Table 2, the key resource for firms seems to be the 
percentage  of  employment  in  S&T  following  the  employees  holding  bachelors, 
postgraduate  or  professional  degrees.  The  other  results  remained  virtually  unchanged, 
the only exception is the index of specialization that loses its significance. 

Conclusions 

The  relationship  between  innovation  and  territory  has  been  the  subject  of  increasing 
attention in the literature because there is an increasingly perception that factors related 
to location can play an important role in fostering and stimulating innovation. However, 
this discussion has paid little heed in emerging countries. In this way, this paper sought 
to  contribute  to  decrease  this  gap  by  examine  how  the  territorial  factors  affect 
innovation in Brazil, applying the Knowledge Production Function (KPF) in two levels. 

The  main  results  that  comes  off  of  this  analysis  is  that,  even  in  developing  countries 
where the innovation levels are low and characterized mostly by imitation strategies, the 
territorial  factors  are  important  predictors  of  innovation.  More  specifically,  this  result 
suggests  that  the  combination  of  greater  availability  of  more  skilled  and  less  young 
labour is a strong factor that can make firms more susceptible to innovation.  

In  addition,  the  economic  agglomeration  and  specialized  productive  activities  have 
played an important  role for innovation  in Brazil. Firms  located in  more economically 
agglomerated  regions  or  that  have  production  structure  which  operates  mainly  in  a 
specific  industry  tend  to  be  more  innovative  than  others  elsewhere.  Meanwhile, 
population  agglomeration  or  knowledge  spillovers  did  not  show  significant  in  this 
process. 

Therefore,  more  than  a  critical  mass  is  necessary  in  order  to  expect  substantial  local 
economic effects of the innovation efforts. It is essential the skilled employees to absorb 
and disseminate the knowledge for the innovation to occur.
