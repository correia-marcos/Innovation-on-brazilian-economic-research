of  relatively  high  degree  of  uncertainty,  decisions  to  accumulate  capital  rely  heavily  on  retained 
earnings and are negatively affected by the persistent high level of interest rates. In our econometric

1.  Introduction 

 
Recent  Brazilian  development  has  been  disappointing.  Compared  with  other  emerging 
economies,  the  Brazilian  performance  has  been  one  of  the  lowest  among  developing 
economies.  In  the  2011-13  period,  for  instance,  according  to  the  World  Bank  Indicators, 
Brazil grew 2.1% in average against 8.2% in China, 5.5%, in India, 2.9% in Russia, 2.6% in 
South  Africa.  Despite  low  growth,  inflationary  pressures  have  being  increasing,  although 
Brazilian real interest rates are among the highest in the world.  
 
Conventional  wisdom  has  being  pointing  out  as  the  main  causes  to  the  dilemma  of  low 
growth and accelerating inflation lack of credibility in the political economy, constant delays 
in  microeconomic  reforms  aiming  at  giving  transparency  to  economic  institutions,  low 
investment  in  human  capital  and  infrastructure.  In  this  paper,  although  recognizing  the 
relevance  of  these  issues,  we  consider  that  they  offer  only  a  partial  explanation  for  the 
dilemma  of  low  growth  and  relatively  high  inflation,  as  they  do  not  consider  either  the 
distributional  impacts  of  economic  policies  measures  or  the  long-term  effects  of  these 
policies. In our view, they miss fundamental causal links that are essential to explain the main 
driving forces of economic growth.

The starting point to shed some light on the reasons why the Brazilian economy has lost its 
vigour is to assume that short-term stabilization polices relying on interest rate as the main 
instrument  to  control  inflation  have  long-run  effects  on  the  level  of  output,  and  so  on 
productivity, rather than on prices. This follows from two basic assumptions. On one hand, 
as in Keynes and Kalecki, we assume that prices are determined by costs, and so, when short-
term interest rate rises, it raises the relative prices of goods in which interest payments are an 
especially important ‘ingredient’ (Hannsgen, 2006, p. 216). In this sense, monetary policy is 
not distributional neutral on the supply side. On the other hand, movements in the interest 
rate changes ‘the distribution of income between those who earn interest and those who have 
few investments’(ibid, p. 216), and in this case it affects expenditures decisions. In both cases 
the rise of interest rate aiming at fighting inflation can lead not only to price increases, but 
also to the change in the composition and the amount of output. To put it in other words, 
monetary  policy  has  permanent  effects  on  the  real  side  of  the  economy  because  it  affects 
interest rate, and in Keynes´view, it is the rate of profit, via the rate of investment, that is 
adjusted to the rate of interest.  
 
The  central  role  of  interest  rate  in  short-term  economic  policy  in  the  so-called 
‘macroeconomic consensus’ (Woodford, 2008, for instance) has facilitated the deepening of 
the financialization. Following Palley (2007), financialization is a process whereby financial 
markets,  financial  institutions,  and  financial  elites  gain  greater  influence  over  economic 
policy  and  economic  outcomes.  Financialization  transforms  the  functioning  of  economic 
systems at both the macro and micro levels.1  
 
Since  the  economic  opening  in  the  early  1990s,  Brazilian  economy  experienced  several 
institutional  reforms  that  favoured  ‘financial  motives’  as  the  main  guidance  for  economic 
decision  making.  As  a  consequence,  interest  rates  are  among  the  highest  in  the  world, 
investment rate did not recover and Brazil is falling behind in terms of productivity growth. 
According  to  Bruno  et  al  (2011),  this  can  lead  to  a  stagnation  or  slowdown  in  the 
accumulation  of  productive  capital  in  the  economy.  Therefore,  "developing  countries, 
financialization becomes an even greater structural obstacle because it causes the functional 
re-concentration of income in favor of capital holders without necessarily inducing them to 
raise the level of productive investment…"(op. cit., p 747). 
 
In this paper we are interested in discussing how interest rate in Brazil affects growth through 
its impact on investment decision after price stabilization, in order to shed light on the reasons 
why investment rate does not improve. Investment might be sensitive to interest rate in many 
ways. A direct effect is on the cost of credit. As interest rate affects the price of credit, firms 
will not undertake an investment project if it yields a return less than this price. Another way 
of looking at this effect is consider the effect of interest rate changes on the generation of the 
cash flow. As cash flow is an important source of funding for the firm, changes in the cost of 
borrowing can either increase the preference for retained profits to finance investment or it 
can  induce  firms  to  purchase  financial  assets.  In  a  less  direct  form,  interest  rate  affects 

                                                 
1  According  to  the  author,  the  principal  impacts  of  financialization  are  to  (1)  elevate  the  significance  of  the 
financial sector relative to the real sector, (2) transfer income from the real sector to the financial sector, and 
(3) increase income inequality and contribute to wage stagnation. Additionally, there are reasons to believe that 
financialization may put the economy at risk of debt deflation and prolonged recession.

consumer borrowing, which greatly contribute to consumption expenses and so  to explain 
the dynamic of the domestic market.  In open economies, the level  of the  interest  rate can 
affect international flows of capital and so the supply of domestic credit.  
 
Our assumption is  that  as the Brazilian economy  has  been maintaining  high levels  of real 
interest  rate  compared  with  other  emerging  and  developed  economies  since  price 
stabilization, capital accumulation in physical assets has not been stimulated and capital gains 
might be sustained by the accumulation of financial assets. High real interest rates also add 
more uncertainty to long-term decisions, what induces firms to invest in the financial market 
in order to sustain their profits gains. The cumulative result of this behavior along time shows 
low  growth  rates  and  lost  of  economic  dynamism.  Recent  literature  on  globalization  and 
financialization helps to understand the behavior of capital accumulation of productive firms 
in  Brazil  as  it  highlights  the  interaction  between  financial  and  non-financial  firms.  So,  in 
what  follows  we  shall  investigate  the  behavior  of  investment  in  the  context  of  greater 
financial integration of the Brazilian economy and so contribute to the debate of the causes 
of the slow growth of the Brazilian economy in the present decade. 
 
This paper is organized in six sections, including this introduction. Section two presents a 
brief discussion about the relation between investment decision and the generation of profits. 
Next section introduces a discussion about the finance-led regime of capital accumulation. 
Section  four,  following  recent  financialization  literature,  analyses  stylized  facts  of  capital 
accumulation  in  Brazil  in  the  1990s  and  2000s.  Section  five  presents  the  results  of  an 
econometric estimation of the determinants of the investment rate in Brazil in the 1990s and 
2000s, and Section six briefly concludes the paper.  
 

2.  Investment decision and the firm´s flow of funds 

 

We  start  with  the  theoretical  assumption  that  the  investment  is  an  increasing  function  of 
profits, for  two main  reasons. The first  argument considers  the  role of  expected profits in 
investment  decision  and  can  be  interpreted  as  explaining  the  motive  to  invest.  Following 
Keynes’s  tradition,  investment  decision  is  supposed  to  be  a  portfolio  choice,  ie  the 
entrepreneur  chooses  which  portfolio  composition  to  hold  combining  fixed  assets  and 
financial  assets  (Keynes,  1936,  ch.  17).  Basically,  this  combination  will  depend  on  the 
expected stream of profits from fixed assets compared with other applications. Different from 
conventional  neoclassical  theory,  Keynes’s  investment  theory  is  based  on  fundamental 
uncertainty, that is to say, the stream of expected profits depends not only on the productivity 
of the new investment but also on the firm’s ability to estimate the size of the market for its 
products a number of years into the future.  
 
The second argument shows the importance of increasing profits to provide internal resources 
to finance investment, that is to say, it explains the means to invest enabling new investments. 
In this case, it is assumed that an increase in the profit share means, ceteris paribus, expansion 
of  internal  resources  to  firms,  which  may  alleviate  any  short-term  restrictions  on  new 
investments in fixed capital (Eichner, 1991, Feijo, 1993). 
 
We should consider now the importance of the interest rate to induce investment decisions. 
In Keynes’s view, firms can only guess the returns their investment might yield. This exercise 

 

4 

is  based  on  long-term  expectations,  rather  than  exact  calculation2.  So,  as  estimates  of  the 
stream of returns involve expectations over a long time horizon, firms, in order to estimate 
the real rate of return must also make estimates for the expected rate of inflation (Hannsgen, 
op. cit), and in an open economy, for the rate of real exchange as well. As the nominal interest 
rate is exogenously fixed, this implies that the central bank can affect the real interest rate, 
and so influence investment decisions.3  
 
However,  Keynes  also  assumed  that  expectations  on  profit  yields,  as  based  on  long  term 
expectations  under  uncertainty,  are  likely  to  vary  in  a  wide  range  and  so  interest  rates 
‘exercise  ….  a  great,  though  not  a  decisive,  influence  on  the  rate  of  investment.  Only 
experience,  however,  can  show  how  far  management  of  the  rate  of  interest  is  capable  of 
continuously  stimulating  the  appropriate  level  of  investment.’  (Keynes,  1936,  p.  164, 
emphasis added.)  In this case, the impact of short-term interest rate in financing investment 
should be analyzed considering the specificities of the financial and productive structure of 
the each economy in its historical context.4  
 
Besides influencing investment decision, interest rate also impacts the preference for retained 
profits. One conventional well accepted explanation why firms rely more on retained profits 
is  Kalecki’s  principle  of  increasing  risk.  According  to  this  principle,  greater  indebtedness 
increases  the  possibility  of  bankruptcy,  and  consequently  the  loss  of  control  to  creditors.5 
Because  of  that  Kalecki  assumed  investment  to  be  a  function  of  firm’s  retained  profit,  as 
retained profits could either be used to directly finance investment as well as be an evidence 
of sound financial situation.  
 
A  simple  way  of  showing  how  interest  payments  might  affect  internal  funds  is  through  a 
modified Eichner’s equation (1991, p.472), as presented by Hannsgen (op. cit). It explains 
the composition of the firm’s discretionary funds as follows:  

E = (Fk + Ff )+ΔD – DS 
E = (Fk + ΔD )+ (Ff – DS)    

 

  

(eq. 1) 

where E is the amount of discretionary funds available to the firm, Fk is the amount of internal 
funds obtained through the operational of the firm’s business and Ff  is the amount of receipt 
obtained from financial application (note that both represent the firm’s cash flow); ΔD is the 
amount it borrows during a given period and DS is the firm’s debt service costs on previously 
incurred debt, which increases in proportion to (r. ΔD), where r is the interest rate on the 
loan.  
 

                                                 
2 This means to say that for firms to be able to obtain the receipts that will allow them to validate their debts 
and to earn the profits they expected it is necessary that they are able to anticipate the right volume and structure 
of  aggregate  demand  to  be  generated.  We  can  consider,  with  Keynes  and  Kalecki,  that  consumption 
expenditures are induced by income. In a closed economy without government, aggregate profits depend on 
investment.  If  investments  are  not  realised,  not  only  some  firms  have  losses  but  also,  through  the  financial 
linkages, suppliers of funds are hurt. 
3 This is another way to say that it is the profit rate that adjusts to the interest rate. 
4  Chick,  1987,  argues  that  in  order  to  deepened  the  understanding  the  role  of  the  interest  rate  on  capital 
accumulation in Keynes, one should care about the role of the speculative demand for money. 
5 The emphasis on increasing risk is close to Minsky’s (1986) ‘two price’ theory.

In the presentation of equation 1 the terms are arranged to make explicit the options the firm 
has to increase its amount of discretionary funds (E). At first, the firm can increase E getting 
additional loans(ΔD term). However, additional loans affect E permanently adding to the 
DS term. But firms may also decide to allocate part of their internal funds in the financial 
market, obtaining part of their internal funds (Ff). So, eq. 1 shows that firms will try to balance 
the debt service with the receipt earned with cash applications in the financial market. The 
impact that an increase in the interest rate will have in the availability of future cash flow for 
discretionary purchases in the long term depends on the balance between debt commitments 
and the generation of cash flow to cover these commitments.6 
 
In this theoretical construction, the interest rate will adversely affect investment in physical 
assets as much as the firm depends on debt to finance capital accumulation. In a scenario of 
increasing interest rates, the degree of the firm’s indebtedness will rise, reducing the space 
for the financing of new investments.7 However, assuming as Kalecki, that firms rely most 
on retained profits to finance capital accumulation, one might take up that the interest rate 
will affect the allocation of internal resources of the firm, inducing them to the accumulation 
of financial capital when interest rate is increasing. This is a strategy to sustain the generation 
of internal profits, when investment in physical assets is not increasing. In aggregate terms 
this might mean that, in a scenario of increasing interest rates, the capital accumulation might 
not increase, not only because the debt service is increasing, but also because firms allocate 
resources  in  the  financial  market.  In  this  case,  capital  accumulation  follows  a  finance-led 
regime.  
 

3.  Financialization and Capital Accumulation  

 
Accumulation  of  capital  involves  many  variables  and  many  possibilities.  In  a  context  of 
increasing  financialization,  that  is  to  say,  when  economic  decisions  are  mainly  guided  by 
‘finance motives’, high interest rates affects income distribution and growth as it increases 
the  profit  share  of  wealth  owners  without  necessarily  increasing  investment  in  physical 
assets, productivity and real wages.  
 
Boyer (2000), for instance, makes a clear distinction between a growth regime induced by 
capital accumulation - known as 'Fordism’, and a growth regime guided by financialization, 
when  labor  productivity  increase  is  no  longer  a  strategic  target  to  non-financial  firm. 
According to him, in a finance-led growth regime, what matters is the financial profitability 
of the firm, regardless of whether this is accomplished via rapid productivity growth, increase 
in workforce efficiency or oligopolistic rents arising from the innovation (op. cit., p. 123). 

                                                 
6 This is the basic reasoning of Minsky’s financial postures describing how payment on debts and receipts of 
income must occur to keep the functioning of the firm in a smooth basis. (Minsky, 1986) 
7 The relationship between debt financing of investment in physical capital implies the payment of interest by 
productive firms, that is to say, part of the firm’s cash flow is appropriated by financial capitalists. Therefore, 
for a given increase in interest payment, investment in fixed capital decrease on the one hand and, while revenue 
from financial firms will increase by another. This is an important issue to be raised, as, according to  Oreiro 
(2013, p 52), an increase in interest income will result, in Kaleckian terms, in a reduction in the share of profits 
appropriated  by  the  capitalist  in  the  productive  sector.  If  this  occurs,  financialization  -  the  increase  in  the 
percentage  of  income  earned  by  financial  firms  -  could  generate  conflicts  among  capitalists  in  spite  of  the 
conflict between capital and labor. 

 

6 

The financialization approach to economic growth implies that the accumulation of wealth 
is not limited to expanding the stock of productive capital, but also to the accumulation of a 
diversified  basket  of  assets  combining  productive  and  financial  capital.  As  much  as  the 
increase in aggregate wealth is the result of the increased accumulation of financial assets, 
aggregate rates of income and output growth will be low and liquidity preference and interest 
rates  will  tend  to  be  high.  Moreover,  in  a  context  of  financial  integration  of  international 
capital markets and flexible exchange rates, opportunities for speculation are intensified. 
 
The  reason  for  that  is  because,  in  a  context  of  financialization,  decisions  involving  long 
period of time end up depending mostly on decisions made by financial firms to expand (or 
contract) funding to meet the demand for acquisition of capital goods or to roll over past debt. 
Under the uncertainty assumption about future prospective yields of funds being offered by 
financial firms, a deterioration in expectations will imply a contraction in the provision of 
new  loans,  either  absolutely  or,  more  likely,  in  relative  terms,  raising  interest  rates.  This 
reaction aims at avoiding the erosion of their safety margins on loans. In this sense, aggregate 
demand is contracted, but not necessarily the share of income earned by the financial sector.  
 
Actually, in the finance-led growth regime, the income share earned by wealth owners would 
tend  to  increase  regardless  the  pace  of  economic  growth.  In  periods  of  optimistic 
expectations, larger volume of loans would guarantee financial firms’ income, and periods 
of deteriorating expectations interest rates would rise when the volume of credit  would be 
reduced  and  growth  rate  decelerated.  This  special  role  of  the  financial  firms  in  the 
accumulation  of  capital  allow  the  financial  sector  to  increase  its  share  in  total  income, 
increasing  the  financial  wealth,  despite  the  deceleration  in  the  growth  rate  of  aggregate 
income and output. 
 
The share of profit of the non-financial sector in total income, on the other hand, depends on 
past capital accumulation. As shown by Kalecki, in a closed economy without government 
the  amount  of  profits  of  non-financial  firms  is  determined  by  past  investment  decisions 
(Kalecki [1965](1997), p.75). This reasoning shows a complex interconnection between the 
micro and macro levels of analysis: non-financial firm’s form, at the micro level, expectations 
of sales to  obtain profits;  but  the confirmation  of these expectations depends on the firms 
themselves spending the amount necessary to validate the sales expectations.8 
 
Since  decisions  to  invest  are  made  under  uncertainty,  confidence  on  expectations  guiding 
investment in fixed assets is built based on the validation of previous plans and expectations. 
Two sorts of risks are actually incurred by firms when deciding to invest in physical capital. 
One deals with the behaviour of their markets that will or will not allow them to validate their 
production and pricing decisions. Another one deals with the validation of their debts, that is 
to say, with the ability of the firm to keep the value of its assets balanced with that of their 
liabilities.  
 
The way that this balance can be assured is through the maintenance of an equilibrated cash 
flow along the periods. That is to say that the extent to which non-financial firms will be able 

                                                 
8 For individual firms the generation of profits on physical investment is a necessary condition to keep the value 
of their assets balanced with that of their liabilities.  

 

7 

to keep their business running in equilibrium will depend at first instance, on their ability to 
generate  a  cash  inflow  that  is  enough  to  meet  their  debt  commitments,  and,  on  a  second 
instance, on their ability to keep their borrowing capacity in the financial market. At each 
moment  in  time  the  degree  of  vulnerability  of  the  business  will  be  given  by  the  financial 
situation of the firm that will allow it to have more or less room for manoeuvre and keep its 
commitments updated in case production or sales expectations are disappointed.  
 
Therefore, for non-financial firms, in an uncertain world to keep part of the firm’s internal 
resources in financial assets, deviating resources from the accumulation of fixed assets, is a 
rational decision, as it makes options flexible in case expectations and confidence suffer a 
great change. This means to say that the higher (lower) the stock of financial assets in relation 
to its stock of debt, the higher (lower) will be its income from net interest.  
 
Assuming that retained profit is the main source of finance to capital accumulation, a higher 
(lower) investment in physical capital will imply higher (lower) share of future profit of non-
financial firms in aggregate income. So, in aggregate terms, non-financial firms will be able 
to  increase  their  share  of  profit  as  much  as  investment  in  physical  capital  increases  and 
aggregate income expands. This should occur when the expected return on physical capital 
should more than overcome the profit - or interest income - on the financial capital. If the 
opposite scenario occurs, retained earnings will not result in expansion of physical capital, 
but of finance capital, thus increasing the share of net interest income on total profit of non-
financial  firms.  In  the  finance-led  growth  regime,  less  capital  accumulation  will  imply  a 
reduction  in  the  growth  rate  of  the  economy  and  hence  the  aggregate  income,  without 
necessarily reducing the share of income appropriated by firms (financial and non-financial). 
 
If it is assumed that firms debt finance their investment expenditures in a large scale,  this 
means that they expect earnings generated through capital accumulation to grow at a faster 
rate than interest rate (as in eq. 1), so they can keep their cash flow balanced. A shortfall of 
profits  in  face  of  the  needs  for  cash  to  validate  debts  and/or  a  change  in  the  financial 
conditions to roll over past debt commitments, will increase the cost of additional debt (as 
demand  for  liquidity  increases),  implying  an  increase  of  income  to  be  transferred  to  the 
financial sector, depressing investment expenditures. 9 
 
In  short,  finance-led  growth  has  redistributive  regressive  aspects  because  financialization 
causes the relative decline in investment returns arising from fixed capital and an increase in 
returns  from  financial  investments,  increasing  the  share  of  income  appropriated  by  firms 
without necessarily increasing aggregate income and aggregate product. Palley (2007, p. 3) 
argues that financialization can cause economic instability and financial fragility, which is 
why policy makers should be concerned about the downward trend in the real rate of growth 
and  income  distribution,  because  the  crisis  generated  in  the  financial  sector  may  worsen 
income distribution and, consequently, economic growth. 
                                                 
9 In so far we have made the distinction between the profit share considering financial and non financial firms. 
It should also be added a word in relation to the profit and wages conflict. Capital accumulation in physical 
assets should increase labor productivity, and to the extent that this gain is appropriated by wage earners, the 
share of wage and profit in total income should not change. But if productivity gains are not incorporated in 
total or partially by wage earners, than there will be a tendency to the concentration of wealth in the hands of 
capitalists.

4.  The behavior of investment in the 1990s and 2000s: stylized facts for 

the Brazilian economy 
 

According to Palley (2014), financialization is manifested through changes in three different 
channels: in the behavior of non-financial firms, in economic policy and in the structure and 
operation of financial markets. In Brazil, in the first case, throughout the 1990s and 2000s, 
despite  important  changes  in  the  economic  environment  such  as  price  stabilization  and 
economic opening, the decision making process of private firms emphasized the short-term 
returns;  economic  policy,  on  its  turn,  has  been  characterized  by  a  stop-and-go  pattern, 
keeping  the  economy  in  a  ´trap´  low  exchange  rate  and  high  interest  rates;  lastly,  private 
financial firms did not evolve in providing resources to finance long-term investment. So, 
the three channels worked in the direction to deepen financialization process in the country. 
 
To understand the change in the behavior of Brazilian firms in the 1990s, when the economy 
conquered price stability and opened its economy, we should first recall the period of high 
inflation  of  the  1980s  and  early  1990.  During  high  inflation,  contract  indexation  was  a 
common practice that pervaded all monetary transactions.  The wide acceptance of indexation 
of contracts worked as a defense mechanism for firms to ensure adequate profit margins and 
cash  flow  to  preserve  their  financial  capacity  to  face  unexpected  changes  in  costs  and  to 
finance  investments  necessary  to  maintain  their  participation  in  the  market.  Contract 
indexation allowed non-financial firms when setting their prices to incorporate inflationary 
expectations,  feeding  up  the  inflationary  process  whenever  inflationary  expectations  were 
accelerated. As inflation rates increased continuously along the 1980s and early 1990s, being 
interrupted  only  when  a  stabilization  plan  was  launched,10  the  time  horizon  of  private 
economic decisions has been shortened, and long-term commitment of financial resources 
were strongly discouraged. In this context, the financial sector developed short-term financial 
products to provide short-term financial application alternatives. So, after the success of the 
stabilization  plan  in  1994,  the  Brazilian  economy  was  in  a  low  debt  situation.  Also,  as  a 
consequence of the long period of high inflation regime, the share of the financial sector in 
GDP reached more than 30% in 1993, and sharply decreased afterwards with the end of the 
gains with inflationary floating. 
 
It should be expected that price stabilization after 1994 should have contributed to enlarge 
the time horizon of private decisions of non-financial firms, improving investment rate and 
aggregate growth of the economy. However, for many different reasons the last two decades, 
this was not observed.11  
 
During  the  first  phase  of  the  stabilization  period  (1994-1998),  under  fixed  exchange  rate 
regime, economic policy relied a great deal in trade liberalization to increase competition and 
refrain  price  increase  in  tradables.  Firms,  in  general,  reacted  investing  in  technological 
upgrading taking advantage of the appreciation of the real exchange rate, with relatively low 

                                                 
10 This occured with the Cruzado Plan (February 1986), Bresser Plan (July 1987), Summer Plan (January 
1989) and Collor Plan (March 1990). 
11 Investment rate was 21.4% in the 1970s, 22.2% in the 1980s, 17.9% in the 1990s and 16.8% in the 2000s.

investment in fixed capital. As a result, aggregate productivity increased in the first years of 
price stabilization, in spite of low aggregate growth.  
 
One explanation why the rate of investment did not improve after the end of the high inflation 
regime  is  because  economic  opening  added  up  other  sort  of  uncertainties  to  the 
macroeconomic environment. Actually, stabilization of inflation did not go along with the 
recovery of growth, as GDP growth rates were 2.2% in average per year in the 1995-2003 
period  (Table  1).  During  the  stabilization  period  external  environment  did  not  favoured 
growth as a succession of external shocks occurred: in 1994 the Mexican crisis, in 1997 the 
Asian  crisis,  in  1998  the  Russian  crisis.  Additional  to  those  events,  in  2001  the  Brazilian 
economy suffered a severe electric energy crisis and in 2002 the country faced capital flight 
as the result of negative expectations of the presidential election of a candidate (Luiz Inácio 
Lula da Silva), who was then adversely evaluated by markets in Brazil. In an environment of 
unstable  macroeconomic  expectations,  the  performance  of  gross  capital  formation  was 
disappointing  (0.4%  in  average  per  year).  We  should  add  to  the  list  of  reasons  for  low 
investment  rate,  the  excessively  conservatism  of  the  economic  policy,  aiming  mostly 
stabilization goals. 12  
 
The commodity boom in the first half of the 2000s allowed the Brazilian economy to perform 
better in relation to the previous period. However, the period of relatively high growth (2004-
2008), when the average growth rate reached at 4.8% per year, was a short one. In this period 
gross fixed capital formation expanded 8.2% in average, and this expressive recovery was 
interrupted  in  2009,  after  the  international  financial  crisis,  and  the  sudden  change  in 
expectations about the return of long term commitment of resources. Since then, the Brazilian 
economy is decelerating its growth rates (2.6% in the 2009-2014 period) and the investment 
rate fell to less than a half of the in the last period compared with the 2004-2008.

Therefore, since price stabilization, the Brazilian economy has not decreased its degree of 
external  vulnerability,  what  did  not  contributed  for  the  recovery  of  the  investment  rate. 
Actually, the degree of vulnerability has increased, as a consequence of the long period of 
overvaluation of the real exchange rate, which led to an early de-industrialization process, 
deepening  the  country´s  dependence  on  exports  of  primary  products  and  industrial 

                                                 
12 As Serrano and Summa (2011, p. 27) point out, even when external constraints were relaxed in mid 2000s, 
"Brazilian authorities were a bit slow in realizing this and beginning to take advantage of the considerable policy 
space that was opened". They conclude that although the economic policy did not change the economy showed 
a better performance due to the boom of exports, which was interrupted after the international financial crisis.

commodities  based  on  natural  resources.13  So,  besides  the  external  fragility,  the 
implementation of neoliberal economic policies since the beginning of the 1990s, following 
the  Washington  Consensus  recommendations,  reduced  policy  space  for  pro-growth 
governmental initiatives. After the sequence of external shocks in the mid-1990s, the main 
policy  instruments  adopted  aiming  at  stabilizing  the  economy  were  inflation  targeting, 
primary  fiscal  superavits  and  flexible  exchange  rate.  This  prescription  resulted  in  the 
persistence  of  high  levels  of  nominal  and  real  interest  rates  and  real  exchange  rate 
misalignment. 14  
 
Graph 1 shows the evolution of the gross capital formation since 1995 and long-term interest 
rate. From 1996-2003, average investment rate was 16.5% and economic growth rate was 
2.5% per year; during the period of higher rates of growth  (2004-2008), GDP growth rate 
was 4.8% per year and the rate of investment was 17% of GDP. In the more recent period 
(2009-2014), GDP growth rate was 2.6% per year and the investment rate 18.5% in average. 
The slow evolution of the investment rate (increase of 2 percentage points) is related to the 
slow decline in the nominal long-term interest rate, that reached a level around 5% aa in the 
last years. It should be observed that during the second mandate of president Lula da Silva 
(2007-2010), growth became an explicit concern of economic policy, with the launching of 
a  governmental  plan  to  stimulate  investment:  the  PAC  -  Política  de  Aceleração  do 
Crescimento  (Policy  for  Accelerating  Growth).  Also,  in  the  first  mandate  of  president 
Rousseff, another attempt to promote growth was made with the launching in April 2013 of 
the  Plano  Brasil  Maior  (Mayor  Brazilian  Plan).  As  the  main  pillars  of  the  neo-liberal 
macroeconomic agenda - inflation target and primary fiscal surplus were kept untouched – 
these initiatives showed a poor result, and growth rates, as well as investment rates, did not 
resume.  
 
From the point of view of the financial sector, the end of high inflation and economic opening 
led to a strong concentration and internationalization of the banking sector. The consolidation 
process of the banking sector under price stability occurred through mergers and acquisitions 
that resulted in higher bank concentration and a reduction in the importance of public banks15. 
Banking sector was open to foreigners in 1997, based on the assumption that it would help 
to increase the sector’s efficiency as well as to reduce bank rates and spreads. Expectations 
about the positive effects of greater weight of private institutions in the banking sector and 
the entry of foreign banks were largely disappointed. The share of credit to firms in GDP was 
reduced from 36% in December 1994 to around 27% in December 2003. In other words, after 
the stabilization there was a setback in the financial development of the Brazilian economy. 
When the macroeconomic environment changed, due to the boom in foreign trade and the 
improvement  in  the  terms  of  trade  from  2004  onwards,  credit  market  showed  a  great 
recovery, increasing its share in GDP significantly. However, the remarkable change in the 

                                                 
13 See, for instance, Oreiro and Feijo, 2010; Feijo and Lamonica, 2012, among others. 
14 Several authors interpret that the formation of interest rate in Brazil is based on a 'convention'. Bresser-Pereira 
and Nakano (2002, p. 169) for instance, state that , "After the persistent maintenance of interest rates at very 
high level, it is natural that there is a fear of reduction and so that level becomes a convention in the Keynesian 
sense of the term, and also a trap. Therefore, there will not be easy to  escape the perverse equilibrium of the 
interest rate that we got ourselves into many years ago 
15 After 2008, the process of reducing the share of public banks in the financial sector was reversed.

performance  of  the  Brazilian  banking  sector  was  mostly  due  to  an  increase  in  credit  to 
households (Graph 2).

Evidence from the evolution of private credit suggests that firms still rely a  great  deal  on 
retained  profit  to  finance  capital  accumulation  in  Brazil.16  Indeed,  Table  2  shows  that  the 
ratio of retained profits to gross capital formation of non-financial firms covers around 80% 
or more of total investment in physical assets.17 In years of low growth, as 2001 and 2002 

                                                 
16 See Moreira e Puga (2001), for instance. 
17 It should be mentioned that large companies and those working in specific sectors can get finance through 
public investment banks, allowing them to carry out investment projects using long-term debt finance supplied 

 

12 

and  after  the  international  financial  crisis,  the  share  of  retained  profits  was  over  100%  in 
relation to gross capital formation. Such a high dependence of non-financial firms to internal 
resources  is  an  expression,  on  one  hand,  of  limited  funding  available  to  boost  capital 
accumulation in the Brazilian economy, in spite of the highly sophisticated financial sector.  
 
On the other hand, as investment rate is relatively low in comparison with other emerging 
economies in the period,18 one could suggest that part of retained profits might be allocated 
in  the  accumulation  of  financial  capital.  So,  the  investigation  of  the  specificities  of  the 
financialization process in Brazil should consider the macroeconomic scenario susceptible to 
external shocks, reduced policy space for pro-growth policies,19 and persistent high nominal 
and real interest rates, as driving forces which induce the accumulation of financial capital.

4.1- The specificities of the finance-led regime in Brazil  
 
Bruno et al (2011, p. 735), argues that structural and cyclical conditions contributed to turn 
the Brazilian economy into a finance-led growth regime. For the authors, high real interest 
rate  paid  by  governmental  bonds  strongly  attracts  savings  from  non-financial  firms.  This 
implies to say that in the Brazilian case, more than the increase in the private debt, it is the 
increase of the public debt that gives oxygen to the spreading of rentier’s behavior. 
 
It  would  be  reasonable  to  say  that  the  specificity  of  the  Brazilian  financialization  process 
rests on a great deal on the management of the monetary policy since price stabilization. As 
already mentioned, the Brazilian real interest rates are among the highest in the world, and 
according  to  Bresser-Pereira  and  Nakano  (2002),  the  high  level  of  the  nominal  and  real 
interest rates are due to a convention, which is harder to change in a inflation target regime.  
We should observe that inflation targeting has been showing relatively little effect to curb 
inflation in Brazil: since 1999, when inflation target regime has been implemented, until 2014 
in only 4 years official inflation reached the center of the target: 2000; 2006; 2007; 2009. A 
large  literature  discusses  the  causes  for  such  poor  results  (for  instance,  Modenesi  2008; 
Bresser-Pereira,  2012),  focusing  on  the  many  causes  for  inflationary  pressures,  which  are 
less affected by the interest rate policy.  
 
On the other hand, persistent high levels of interest rate have several deleterious effects on 
other macroeconomic indicators, besides turning the management of the public debt costly. 

                                                 
by public development banks. But assuming that most non financial firms in Brazil do not have access to public 
or foreign funds the accumulation process of most Brazilian firms takes place via retained earnings. 
18 According to the PenWorld Table statistics, from 1990-2011, the average rate of investment was 18.1% in 
Brazil; 20.8% in Russia, 22.6% in India; 33.3% in China and 20.1% in South Africa. 
19 According to Ocampo and Vos (2008), the neoliberal agenda of economic policy, as the one followed by the 
Brazilian economy after stabilization, reduces policy space in developing economies, since their growth cycles 
are determined by the external environment, and little room is left for contra-cyclical measures. 

 

13 

Also it increases interest rate differential attracting speculative capital, increasing external 
vulnerability.  In both  cases, the degree of uncertainty in  the economy is  augmented,  what 
deeply hurts capital accumulation. Thus, by adopting the inflation targeting since 1999, the 
Brazilian economy has been reducing its policy space to implement long lasting structural 
reforms to recover the investment rate.  
 
So, the financialization process in Brazil is reinforced by short-term economic policies which 
negatively affect long-term investment plans. The low expected return of the investment in 
fixed  capital  compared  to  the  returns  offered  by  short-term  financial  assets,  these  ones 
relatively safe as they are in a large scale issued by the government, induces the allocation of 
savings of non-financial firms to financial accumulation, affecting long-term growth. In this 
sense,  the  financialization  process  that  occurs  in  the  Brazilian  economy  depresses  capital 
accumulation via increased preference for financial assets within a purely rentier logic. The 
increase in basic interest rate contributes to the reduction of productive capital accumulation, 
most  because  it  turns  more  attractive  the  allocation  of  resources  in  financial  assets,  than 
because the cost of funding has been raised.  
 
In this context, the increased demand for financial assets does not imply an increase in the 
financing of investment in productive capacity, but rather a reduction in investment as the 
financial  capital  competes  with  productive  capital.  20  In  our  interpretation,  the  process  of 
financialization in Brazil, mainly in the 2000s, is largely due to the inflation targeting policy, 
maintaining high real interest rates and consequently increasing the liquidity preference of 
financial and non-financial firms. 
 
In sum, as growth rates have been relatively low and unstable since stabilization, we suggest 
that the macroeconomic policy, following the neoliberal agenda of economic reforms,  has 
not  privileged  capital  accumulation  in  Brazil.  The  financeirization  process  in  Brazil, 
differently from other international experiences, is not directly linked to the reduction of the 
wage share in total income, but it is the result of the increasing weight of financial income in 
total savings.21 So the financeirization process is explained, on one hand, by persistent high 
rates  of  interest  in  the  financial  market  which  establishes  a  too  high  floor  to  productive 
investment  to  compete,  and  on  the  other  hand,  by  the  high  vulnerability  of  the  Brazilian 
economy  to  external  shocks,  which  reduces  the  degree  of  confidence  in  expectations  that 
would support long term commitment of resources.  
 
5. Estimating an Investment Function for the Brazilian Economy in the 1990s 
and 2000s 

 

In the financialization literature, income distribution and its effects on capital accumulation 
play a key role in determining economic growth regimes. Our purpose in this  section is to 
estimate the behavior of the investment rate in the Brazilian economy after price stabilization. 
According  to  the  discussions  briefly  presented,  at  least  three  groups  of  variables,  as  in 

                                                 
20 According to Bruno et al (2011, p. 745) ´as firms do not get enough returns to justify productive allocation 
of resources, their gains or savings are allocated to the financial sector´.  
21 The share of savings from financial firms to total domestic savings increased from 8.9% in 2000 to 17.0% in 
2009, according to the National Accounts. 

 

14 

equation 2 below, can be tested to explain the investment rate: one expressing the weight of 
the cost of funds (r and ), other the weight of aggregate demand and the role of the income 
distribution  (u  and ),  and  another  the  weight  of  the  policy  space  to  grow  captured  by  a 
measure of the degree of external vulnerability and the cost to roll over public debt ( and , 
respectively), that can affect the investment drive of firms.  
 
In formal terms, the rate of investment (g), is expressed as:  

      (eq. 2) 

Where 0 stands for the growth rate of autonomous investment, r is the interest rate;  is the 
average degree of firm’s indebtedness; u is the degree of capacity utilization;  is the profit 
share;  the degree of  external  vulnerability;  the cost  to  roll over  the  public debt and   
stands for the term of the error (see description of the variables in the Appendix).  
 
The estimation of the rate of investment with these blocks of variables is an attempt to capture 
the impact of the financialization channels on the capital accumulation behavior of firms in 
Brazil. The first block captures the impact of changes in the interest rate on the investment 
decision  of  the  firms;  the  second  block  captures  how  firms  react  to  changes  in  aggregate 
demand  and  the  third  block  measures  the  impact  of  changes  in  the  macroeconomic 
environment due to the administration of economic policy which are reflected in the foreign 
and public indebtedness.  
 
The  cost  of  external  funds  for  firms  is  expressed  by  the  level  of  the  interest  rate  and  the 
average  degree  of  the  firm’s  indebtedness.  The  access  of  firms  to  debt  finance  their 
investment plans contributes positively to the growth of investment, although increase in the 
cost of funding should affect negatively. In Brazil, considering that debt security market it is 
not  well  developed  yet,  and  long  term  credit  is  only  supplied  by  public  banks,  it  will  be 
assumed that firms greatly rely on retained profit to finance their capital accumulation. This 
will imply that greater investment rate shall be related to negative cost of funds and higher 
degree of indebtedness.  
 
The pioneer work by Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) expressed the investment rate as a function 
of the capacity utilization and profit share. The impact of the profit share on growth depends 
on  its  effect  on  investment.  22  The  use  of  idle  capacity  as  a  proxy  for  variation  aggregate 
demand  in  an  investment  function  is  supported  by  Steindl  (1976),  for  whom,  producers 
operating in a market with some degree of oligopoly deliberately maintain an adequate level 
of spare capacity which enables the firm accommodate fluctuations in effective demand, thus 
preventing the entry of new competitors or the expansion of the market share of firms already 
established.  It  follows from  this competitive strategy that  increased effective demand in  a 
given  sector  will  be  accompanied  by  rising  investment  by  established  firms  seeking  to 
maintain the level of planned idle capacity. Increases (decreases) in aggregate demand in the 
short term, given a desired level of capacity utilization, will result in increases (decreases) in 
investment in physical capital. 

                                                 
22 The hypothesis that increased profit-share does not stimulate the expansion of investment has been made by 
Boyer (2000), Stockhammer (2007), Hein (2013) Palley (2014) among others, as, for them, the financialization 
process is responsible for the slow growth in developed economies.

Finally, given the structural dependence of the Brazilian economy on external savings, we 
add a variable to capture the importance of the external funds to domestic investment. Also 
the cost to roll over public debt is assumed to negatively affect capital accumulation, as the 
finance of public debt is a safe allocation of resources to increase financial accumulation of 
firms.  
 
5.1 Methodological procedures 
 
A first condition to be analyzed before applying the econometric analysis is to check if series 
are stationary. For this purpose, the Phillips and Perron (1988) test described by Hamilton 
(1994, Chapter 17) was carried out and the results are shown in Table A1 in the Appendix. 
The Phillips-Perron statistic adjusts the conventional t-statistic to allow for serial correlation 
in the regression error. This adjustment uses Newey and West's (1987) method to estimate 
the variance of the regression error. 
 
The empirical analysis makes use of generalized method of moments (GMM). One reason 
for  using  GMM  is  that  while  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  (Table  A2  in  the  Appendix) 
estimates have problems of serial autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity or non-linearity, which 
is typical in macroeconomic time series, this method provides consistent estimators for the 
regression (Hansen, 1982). Besides, a way of avoiding the problem of identification has been 
the use of GMM models (Hall, 2005). As pointed out by Wooldridge (2001, p. 95), “to obtain 
a more efficient estimator than two-stage least squares (or OLS), one must have overriding 
restrictions.” The weighting matrix in the equation was chosen to enable the GMM estimates 
to be robust, considering the possible presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of 
unknown form. 
 
5.2 Results 
 
All  the  coefficients  of  our  proposed  regression  (eq.2)  were  significant  and  presented  the 
expected signs. The basic interest rate, which is very high in Brazil, can be pointed out as 
one of the main reasons why investment rate is so low. In spite of the high level of interest 
rate,  the  degree  of  indebtedness,  represented  by  the  evolution  of  credit  loans  to  firms, 
presented  a  positive  sign,  showing  that  firms,  although  relying  on  retained  profits,  would 
react positively to more credit. Besides credit, our estimation showed that the increase in the 
degree of capacity utilization also influenced positively decision to invest in the period.  
 
The  relationship  between  the  investment  rate  and  the  profit  share,  in  the  context  of  our 
discussion, can be  ambiguous.  If profit share  shows a positive  coefficient, it validates the 
Keynesian-Kaleckian hypothesis, meaning that capitalists are accumulating more productive 
capital  as  profits  increase.  Otherwise,  the  profit-share  is  dominated  by  financialization, 
meaning  that  capitalists  are  using  a  larger  fraction  of  retained  earnings  to  accumulate 
financial capital without increasing the rate of investment. The estimation showed a positive 
relationship between g and π, implying that the income distribution between wage and profit 
has affected investment in the period.

The  variable  α  presented  a  negative  sign,  showing  that  the  external  vulnerability  of  the 
country negatively influences the investment decision. This is an expected result, since an 
increasing negative current account balance adds more uncertainty to the administration of 
the economic policy.  
 
Finally,  the  coefficient  of  β  also  showed  a  negative  sign,  which  can  be  interpreted  as  an 
expression  of  the  financialization  process  in  Brazil.  A  coherent  behavior  of  firms,  as 
suggested by eq. 1, is to allocate resources in financial papers in order to increase their cash 
flow for discretionary expenses. In Brazil, given that interest rates are very high, interest rate 
paid by governmental bonds strongly attracts savings from non-financial firms. In this sense, 
this sort of investment strongly competes with investment in capital accumulation.  
 

6.  Concluding remark 

 

Stabilization of inflation was conquered in the mid 1990s, but since then Brazilian economy 
has not shown a stable growth trend. In particular investment rate has been relatively low 
when compared with other similar economies. In this paper we discussed the reasons why 
investment rate does not increase, exploring recent financialization literature. 
 
Our main conclusion is that economic policy has not favoured long term decisions since price 
stabilization in the country. External vulnerability, which has always been a weakness of the 
economy, has not improved with the opening of the economy in the 1990s. Because of that, 
there is little space for pro-growth policies. In a macroeconomic environment of relatively

high uncertainty, decisions to accumulate capital rely a great deal on retained profit and are 
negatively  affected  by  the  persistent  high  level  of  the  interest  rate.  In  our  econometric 
exercise we observed that profit share has a positive correlation with the investment rate in 
the 1990s and 2000s, while financialization, evaluated through the cost to roll over public 
debt, presented a negative result.

Description of the variables 
(1995Q1 to 2011Q4)  
 
The series are available at the website of the Central Bank of Brazil and at the Brazilian 
Statistical Office (IBGE) 
 
g = (investment rate) Gross Fixed Capital Formation and Gross Domestic Product. 
r =(basic interest rate) SELIC interest rate. 
 =(debt ratio) Corresponds to the evolution of supply of loans to private firms, as a proxy 
to the degree of indebtedness. 
u =(capacity utilization) Obtainded from National Industrial Federation. 
  =  (profit  share)  Obtained  by  dividing  the  Gross  Operating  Surplus  -  including  self-
employed - by the sum of Gross Operating Surplus and Wages and Salaries. Gross Operating 
Surplus and Compensation of Employees estimates are only available as a total for the year, 
so they were transformed into a quarterly series according to the evolution of quarterly Gross 
Domestic Product estimates.  
  = Share of the current account balance to GDP. 
 =Share of interest paid by Public Sector to GDP (Brazil Central Bank, serie number 
5321).
