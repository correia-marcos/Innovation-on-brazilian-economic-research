Abstract

In this paper, we investigated two cases of regions that used expansionary ﬁscal policies in recent years to
increase short-term economic activity: the European Monetary Union and Brazil. Using impulse response
functions, we estimated the effects of ﬁscal stimuli in a New-Keynesian framework provided by the Markov-
switching dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (MSDSGE) model. We produced a set of regime-dependent
results that suggest that 1) economic policies should be analyzed from a coordination perspective and 2) the
selected cases need continuous institutional development in order to make better use of ﬁscal instruments and
to make more accommodative public debt decisions.

Keywords: Policy coordination, EMU, Brazil, Regime dominance, Markov switching, MSDSGE.

Resumo

Neste artigo investigamos dois casos de regiões que usaram políticas ﬁscal expansionistas nos últimos anos
para aumentar a atividade econômica de curto prazo: a União Monetária Européia e o Brasil. Usando
funções de impulso resposta, estimou-se os efeitos de estímulos ﬁscais em uma estrutura Novo-Keynesiana
fornecida pelo modelo Markov-switching dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (MSDSGE). Os resultados
dependentes dos regimes sugerem que 1) as políticas econômicas devem ser analisadas sob uma perspectiva
de coordenação e 2) os casos selecionados precisam de desenvolvimento institucional contínuo para fazer
melhor uso dos instrumentos ﬁscais e tomar decisões mais acomodativas sobre a dívida pública.

1 Introduction

The effectiveness of economic policy management depends on many factors, including how shocks affect
the economy and policy interactions. There is an increasing need for the coordinated use of economic policy
instruments (ECD, 2002; Tabak and Tabata, 2004; Sehovi´c, 2014; Cevik et al, 2014; Gros and Alcidi, 2015;
Leino and Saarenheimo, 2016). Thus, a variety of approaches to policy interaction and policy dominance emerge,
as found in Chung et al (2007), Fragetta and Kirsanova (2010), Troy and Leeper (2011), Traum and Yang (2011),
Cebi (2012), Bianchi (2012), Barros and Lima (2014), Bianchi and Ilut (2014), Cevik et al (2014), and Kliem
et al (2016).

The majority of countries that have engaged in expansionary policies in recent years are now facing
difﬁculties, as indicated by several consecutive periods of ﬁscal deﬁcits. In this sense, two cases of inﬂation
targeters (ITers) require our immediate attention, e.g., the European Monetary Union (EMU) and Brazil. While
the ﬁrst comprises a group of independent sovereign states, the second is a country of sovereign federative
states. In Brazil, the lack of coordination in its economic policies has often been the source of macroeconomic
imbalance. Pires and Andrade (2009) found that the greater the composition of the debt indexed to the short-term
interest rate, the longer the duration of the economic cycle.

Three arguments lead us to recognize these cases as a singular opportunity for analysis. First, both regions
present common components of business cycle dynamics. Second, the optimal decisions of their ﬁscal institutions
demand compliance from the member states (EMU) and federative states (Brazil). Third, during the sampled
period (2000-2016), both selected cases of study were experiencing multiple institutional changes that affected
their economic policy coordination and enforcement. From institutions point of view, the monetary policy in
Brazil is executed by the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) and in the EMU it is the European Central Bank (ECB).
The Brazilian ﬁscal holder, for instance, is the National Treasury Secretariat (STN), from recently created
Ministry of Economy, and in the EMU it corresponds to the European Commission (EC).

Thus, a conﬂict potentially emerges, since the institutional obligations of the ﬁscal holder regarding interest
rates and other goal variables are distinct from those of the monetary holder (Dixit, 2001). The considerable
debt crises in the EMU and Brazil and their effects led to an intense discussion about proposed diagnoses
and the effectiveness of policy recommendations (Checherita and Rother, 2010; Ferreira, 2014; Kramolišová
and Spáˇcilová, 2015). The EC established the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) in 1997, which imposes a
set of restrictions on members concerning deﬁcits and public debt. However, the new scenario of debt crisis
brought the reform of the SGP through the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG) and the
implementation of country speciﬁc recommendations (CSRs), which have proven to be difﬁcult in practice (Gros
and Alcidi, 2015).

In Brazil, the political cycle from the early 2000s was the main platform for short-term economic policies.
The Growth Acceleration Program (Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento – PAC), based on increasing credit
and massive investment in infrastructure, prevails form 2003 to 2006 and 2007 to 2011. Replaced by the New
Macroeconomic Matrix (Nova Matriz Macroeconômica – NME) (2011-2014 and 2016), the exhaustion of the
economic model led to a severe internal crisis also characterized by creative accounting and ﬁscal peddling
(Chalhoub et al, 2017). It was followed by stagﬂation (2012Q3-2013Q2 and 2014Q2-2014Q3), over 13 million
Brazilian people unemployed and an impeachment process in 2016. Hence, our motivation is to understand the
role of government expenditure and its effect on macroeconomic indicators in this unique cross-regional case, to
build more effective policy coordination in light of these experiences.

We ﬁrst estimate the parameters of policy dominance regimes for the period from 2000 to 2016. Next,
supported by a Markov-switching dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (MSDSGE) model originally proposed
by Davig and Leeper (2011), we simulate the dynamic impact of a positive increase in public spending using
these estimated parameters. This framework allows us estimate the regimes’ parameters and use them as the
contour conditions in the second stage of the modeling. We estimate the steady state and simulate the impulse

2

response functions (IRFs) of public spending increases to analyze how inﬂation control, interest rate and debt
sustainability decisions are coordinated. Our paper is divided into ﬁve sections in addition to this brief section 1.
In section 2, we present the speciﬁcation of the economic policy regimes and the MSDSGE setup. The data
sample and the estimation procedures are described in section 3, and the results are presented and discussed in
section 4. Finally, general conclusions are drawn in section 5.

2 Model setup

Sargent and Wallace (1981) were pioneers in studying the interaction between ﬁscal and monetary policy
and investigating determinants of the price level. Leeper (1991) describes possible regions for the parameter
spaces, i.e., their interaction and dominance given both forms of economic policy, which may be characterized as
follows: Region I – the monetary authority deploys its policies independently, and there is monetary dominance
(AM/PF), i.e., ﬁscal policy is passive; Region II – there is ﬁscal dominance, which is also referred to as active
ﬁscal policy (PM/AF); Region III – there is passive monetary and passive ﬁscal policy (PM/PF); Region IV:
there is active monetary and active ﬁscal policy (AM/AF). AM/PF is characterized by a balanced budget to
promote the stabilization of the debt/GDP relation . Hence, Ricardian theory is viewed as having prevailed.

The empirical evidence of ﬁscal-monetary policy coordination has been investigated in many countries using
different models (Dungey and Fry, 2009; Fragetta and Kirsanova, 2010; Cebi, 2012; Algozhina, 2012; Barros and
Lima, 2014; Cevik et al, 2014; Ferreira, 2014; Cazacu, 2015; Kliem et al, 2016). The model considers elements
of New-Keynesian paradigms found in real business cycle theory: nonlinearity and the correct identiﬁcation
of the matrix of contemporary effects between variables (Blanchard, 2018). The ﬁrst step is to deﬁne the
MS(M)-VAR(p) to represent the changes in monetary and ﬁscal policy regimes, deﬁned as xt. Then, we estimate
the parameters of the monetary side (αi) and ﬁscal side (βi). Krolzig (2000) describes the MSVAR as

xt = ν(St) + A1(St)xt−1 + ... + Ap(St)xt−p + εt.

(1)
ν(St), A1(St),..., Ap(St) are the parameter shift functions and describe the dependence of the parameters on
each realized regime. They indicate that a permanent change in the mean of such parameters in the current
regime causes an immediate jump in the observed time-series stochastic processes to a new once-and-for-all
level, depending only on the current regime. εt|St is a Gaussian term conditioned to each regime st, with
ε|St ∼ i.i.d. (0,∑(St)). In addition, p is the number of lags, n is the variables’ matrix dimension, and S is the
number of unobserved regime realizations, St ∈ {1,2} for our case. Therefore, the intercept term in equation (1)
assumes a different value depending on the current regime:

(cid:40)

ν(St) =

ν1, f or St = 1
ν2, f or St = 2

(2)

The stochastic processes of policies are such that the probability of being in state k in period (t + 1) depends
only on the current state. The conceived economy includes 1) governments – the ﬁscal authorities that tax
consumers, buy consumer goods, issue debt, and assume responsibility for the money supply as the monetary
holder; 2) households and 3) ﬁrms that produce the ﬁnal goods in monopoly competition. Finally, the hypothesis
of price frictions (Gali et al, 2003) is assumed, as well as the possibility of market imperfections.
1) Government

The set of policies is characterized for two transition equations, which represent the monetary (rt) and
ﬁscal sides (τt) of the investigated economies, described in equations (5) and (6), respectively. These equations
underline that 1) monetary policy endogenously depends on the basic interest rate reaction to changes in inﬂation
and the deviation in the output gap from the calculated values of the steady state and that 2) the government’s

3

revenue endogenously depends on deviations in public debt; government spending and the output gap, i.e., the
response of taxes to the output gap, change the responses to debt and government purchases. The dynamic
impacts of government purchases are assumed to be as in Davig et al (2006) and according to (Gt) are

log(Gt) = log( ¯G)(1− ρ) + ρlog(Gt−1) + εt.

(3)
where Gt are government purchases, ¯G are the steady state government purchases, ρ is the correlation parameter
of government spending, and εt ∼ N(0,σ2). Thus, the government’s optimal choice {Gt,Mt,Bt,τt} must satisfy
the ﬂow of its budget identity. Additionally, we adopted the standard concept of the sequential equilibrium of
markets, taking into account the need for market clearing for public funding.

where τt is the government’s purchase-to-output ratio, Bt is a public bond for one period, rt is the interest rate,
Pt is the price level in period t, and Mt is the money supply, with Mt−1 > 0 and (1− rt−1)Bt−1. The inference of
dating non-observable regimes is made by ﬁltering and smoothing the probabilities using the estimator developed
in Hamilton (1990). For parameter estimation, we use the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM) originally
described by Dempster et al (1977). Following Equation (1), the ﬁscal policy rule is

t

τt = γ0(SF
(5)
where ετ
indicates the ﬁscal policy regime, γ0 is the intercept, and γi represents the respective
elasticity parameters, while bt−1 is the debt-to-GDP ratio in (t − 1), and gt is the government’s primary spending
as the GDP ratio. If γb > 0, the ﬁscal policy is passive, if otherwise, the ﬁscal policy is active.

The institutional monetary policy frameworks of the EMU and Brazil are deﬁned by a Markov-switching
forward-looking Taylor rule (Taylor, 1993). The monetary authority manages a loss function, which represents
the side effects of its decisions on investment and the output gap. This rule means that the nominal interest rate,
rt, depends only on inﬂation πt and the output gap yt and is described as

t )ετ
t .

rt = α0(SM

(6)
where πt is the inﬂation rate, yt is the output gap, α0 is the intercept, αi represents the respective monetary
elasticity parameters and εr
indicates the monetary policy regime. Note that for απ > 1 and
αy > 0, monetary policy is active. Otherwise, it is considered passive. Both policies develop according to the
transition probability matrix T∗, described as follows:

The elements probi,k of the transition matrix represent the probability of being in regime i and of changing
to regime k, respectively. Hence, the MSDSGE allows us to simulate shocks depending on policy dominance

2) Households

There is an identical continuum number of households j ∈ (0,1) that receive remunerations for work, i.e.,
nominal wages, then decide the optimal allocation of consumption (Ct), money and bonds, whose returns are
risk free. Ct is deﬁned as the aggregate value of different consumption goods, Nt is the total amount of hours
worked, and Mt/Pt represents the real money supply. The representative household chooses {Ct,Nt,Mt,Bt} to
maximize the following utility function U:

There is a continuum number of ﬁrms j ∈ (0,1) that operate in monopolistic competition producing j goods
using labor N. The production function is given by y jt = ZNjt, where Z is the aggregate technology, which is
homogeneous among ﬁrms and considered to be constant. We observe the following demand curve of ﬁrm j by
aggregating consumer and government demand:

t , i.e., the ﬁrst-order condition, assumes that a 1− ϕ ratio of ﬁrms adjust
their prices in each period, while the remaining ϕ ratio update their prices according to the most recent inﬂation

4) Steady state

Public debt in the steady state is ﬁxed and independent of the regimes and it is calculated by replacing the
ﬁscal policy rule in the budget constraint equation of the government, maintaining the deterministic value of the
stationary state output equal to one. The ﬁscal policy rule for the intercept is solved as follows:

γ0(SF

t ) = G− m(

t )− β−1
1 + π )

(14)

where γ0(SF
the monetary policy rule into the money demand.

t ) and γ(SF

t ) change according to the current ﬁscal regime. This procedure is applied by substituting

Government purchases affect the equilibrium in this New-Keynesian framework by following transmission
channels: ∆Gt > 0 increases demand for the goods sold by monopolistically competitive intermediate goods-
producing ﬁrms. Thus, intermediate goods-producing ﬁrms face demand and set prices by raising their demand
for labor. Ceteris paribus, greater labor demand increases real wages (Wt/Pt) and real marginal costs. Next,
ﬁrms (i) that have the option to reoptimize their prices will increase them.

3 Estimation

We sampled data from the ﬁrst quarter of 2000 to the third quarter of 2016. The time series used were
collected from the ECB (EMU), the BCB and the STN (Brazil). Potential output was estimated using the
Hodrick–Prescott (HP) ﬁlter proposed by Hodrick and Prescott (1997). All series were calculated for quarterly
frequency, considering the previous period for each observation and removing the seasonal effect. To estimate
the public debt for Brazil, we ﬁrst decompose the federal revenues into National Treasury revenue (NTR) and
social security revenue (SSR). We performed the LR linearity test and estimated the reaction functions displayed
in Table 1. The monetary and ﬁscal reaction functions are both nonlinear.

Seeking robust results, we used different criteria for the changes, e.g., other speciﬁcations were tried,
from regime-dependent mean (MSM(M)-VAR(p)) to the regime-dependent intercept and heteroscedasticity
(MSIAH(M)-VAR(p)). Due to insufﬁcient degrees of freedom (micronumerosity), we estimated the MSM(M)-
VAR(p) considering two regimes. Two MSVAR systems of variables were estimated, including 1) monetary
variables: GDP gap, interest rate (Selic rate in Brazil) and inﬂation and 2) ﬁscal variables: public debt,
government spending and revenues. The ﬁrst regime (AM/PF) for the EMU is characterized by the use of
the interest rate as a reaction function to inﬂation. For regime 2, there is a passive monetary (PM/AF) policy
reaction function for both cases, given that απ < 1. Similarly, in regime 1, the parameter of reaction regarding
the potential output deviations was stationary, and during regime 2, it was negative.

The parameters associated with the public debt of the EMU were positive and statistically signiﬁcant,
indicating the AM/PF regime during the analyzed period. However, the parameter was smaller in the second
regime and considered less passive (AM/PF-), while compared to regime 1 (AM/PF+), it was considered more
passive. The ﬁscal authority had a stronger reaction to the soft budget constraint in the AM/PF+ regime. For
Brazil, the parameters of public debt were positive and statistically signiﬁcant only in regime 1 (AM/PF). Those
parameters associated with the GDP gap and government spending registered positive signs and were statistically

signiﬁcant in regime 2 (PM/AF). The transition matrix of the EMU T M
EMU (at left) indicates that the probability
of permanence in the AM regime is 96.39%, while the probability of changing to the PM/AF regime is 3.61%.
Furthermore, the probability of remaining in the second regime is 98.96%.

On the right, the probability of persistence in AM/PF (T M

BR) is 96.74%, while the probability of continuing
in the AM/PF regime is 99.12%. For the EMU, the T F
EMU matrix, for instance, reports that the probability of
persisting in the AM/PF+ regime is 95.79%. However, the probability of permanence in the AM/PF- is 93.31%.
In Brazil, the ﬁscal side represented by T F
BR indicates that the probability of remaining in the PM/AF regime is
95.79%, and the probability of persisting in the AM/PF is 93.31%.

Figure 3 in Appendix A (section 5) illustrates the probabilities of regimes 1 and 2. Both were more persistent
than those estimated in Davig and Leeper (2011) and Cevik et al (2014). Previous evidence in Brazil regarding
the AM/PF regime (1995-1997) was also observed in Tanner and Ramos (2003), Gadelha and Divino (2008) and
Barros and Lima (2014). They found that the implementation of the Real Plan was the cause of the changes. In
the EMU, the AM/PF+ regime was observed during 2002Q4-2004Q1 and 2006Q2-2009Q2, while the AM/PF-
regime prevailed during 2004Q2-2006Q1. From a monetary policy perspective, the change in regimes registered
in 2009 indicates an interest rate reduction. However, the AM/PF- regime was characterized by higher interest
rates (2.92%).

The very recent PM/AF regime, in turn, registered an interest rate of 0.45%. In addition, the change to the
PM/PF- regime (2009Q3-2012Q1). In this period, we veriﬁed a reduction in the public deﬁcit as a proportion
of GDP in the bloc. While Davig and Leeper (2011) registered for the US the AM/PF (2000-2001), PM/PF
(2002-2003) and PM/AF (2004-2011) regimes, distinct results were found for the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary and Slovenia by Cevik et al (2014). Figure 1 synthesizes the four possible combinations between
monetary and ﬁscal policy in the selected cases:

In Brazil, three policy regimes were observed: AM/PF (2000:Q1-2007:Q2), PM/PF (2007:Q3-2013:Q4),
and PM/AF (2013Q4-2016Q3). Table 2 shows the estimated parameters for ﬁscal and monetary rules used
to calibrate the MSDSGE model. For a goodness of ﬁt diagnosis of policy regimes, additional information

is displayed in Figure 4 in Appendix A (section 5). In addition, we followed the stability and identiﬁcation
conditions to obtain the steady state.

Among the theoretical considerations, we report that 1) if the expected inﬂation and the expected marginal
real cost present the same values in time, a ﬁrm chooses p∗ to equal the expected marginal real cost; 2) it should
be assumed that a ﬁrm expects an increase in marginal real costs in the future. Hence, anticipating this increase,
the ﬁrm chooses a p∗ that is higher than the expected marginal real cost, perhaps because it may not be possible
to adjust p∗ when the marginal real cost materializes (front loading); and 3) ﬁrms expect an increase in future
inﬂation that is higher than E(p∗). The lag of one period implies that the relative price of a ﬁrm falls. To
compensate, the ﬁrm incorporates future changes in the rate of inﬂation into p∗. This variable is also directly
affected by the proportion of ﬁrms that are allowed to update their prices (1− ϕ). If the proportion of such ﬁrms
rises, inﬂationary inertia also increases.

4 Results

The EMU’s GDP was below its potential during the periods from 2003 to 2006 and from 2009 to mid-2015,
also consequence of the 2008 crisis (Algozhina, 2012). Assuming that increased public spending would lead to
a rise in private consumption, particularly in the short term, the EC implemented expansionist policies through
ﬁscal stimulus packages. Fiscal policy was procyclical in the AM/PF+ regime, while it was countercyclical
in the AM/PF-. Besides, in periods of economic expansion our results suggest that governments reduce the
revenue/GDP ratio in the AM/PF+, while in the AM/PF-, this ratio increases. In parallel, with the annualized
inﬂation near the annual target of 2% (2002 – 2008), seems that the ECB enacted a quantitative easing policy.
This was indicated by the annualized basic interest rate reduction from 4.98% to 0.72% in the fourth quarter of
2009 and its negative correlation with the output gap.

Furthermore, the public expenditure parameters for both regimes were statistically signiﬁcant and had
negative signs. These outcomes suggest that an increase in the public spending/GDP ratio reduces ﬁscal
revenues. As a consequence, the public debt increased from 68.6% of GDP (2008) to 91.3% (2013). From this
period on, this value remained stable at near 90.7% of the EMU’s GDP in 2016. The Brazilian output was below
its potential in the period of 2002 to 2003, 2009 and during 2013 to 2016. It was registered an upward trend
in inﬂation (over 10% per year) and paradoxically, lower interest rates as well. The period of 2015-2016 was
characterized by rising interest rates, public expenditures in relation to GDP and unemployment for over 13
million Brazilian people. This latter period was marked by so-called creative accounting (2007-2013), which
mitigated and distorted information about public debt sustainability.

The elasticity of the demand of money, the velocity of monetary circulation and the steady state inﬂation
rate reﬂect that Brazil has historically experienced much more difﬁculty managing inﬂation than the EMU. The
steady state government spending/GDP, the steady state public debt/GDP, the parameters of debt and the GDP
gap in the AM/PF regime also highlight that ﬁscal instruments were less elastic in Brazil than in the EMU.
Figure 2 highlights the IRFs, which represent the simulation of positive shocks of 3% on the residues εt of
government spending (equation (5)).

As expected, the IRFs in Brazil were more elastic than those registered in the EMU and for all regimes, the

10

output gap increases. A greater magnitude of responses (> 1) is observed in the EMU when the PM/PF- regime
prevails, followed by the PM/PF+. In Brazil, the magnitude of responses (< 1) suggests the relative inefﬁciency
of public expenditure with respect to GDP. Except for the monetary dominance regime (AM/PF-), there is an
increase in private consumption, as claimed by ﬁscal theory. In the AM/PF regime, private consumption falls,
consistent with Ricardian theory, and the effect also implies a consumption drop. In the AM/PF regime the
shock suggests that the monetary holder reacts with higher nominal interest rates. Otherwise, the ﬁscal holder
must raise taxes to ﬁnance the increase in incremental expenditures. Thus, the agents incorporate this future
ﬁscal responsibility into their expectations, e.g., current and future consumption decisions. In contrast, increases
in interest rates were lower than increases in inﬂation in other regimes.

According to the hypothesis of monopolistic competition, the inﬂation increase is explained by two trans-
mission channels: 1) ﬁrms observe their real marginal costs and a proportion φ of them are characterized by a
forward-looking price reoptimization function. Thus, they can establish prices in anticipation of inﬂation. From
another perspective, it is possible that a proportion (1−φ) of ﬁrms with a backward-looking price reoptimization
function produce inﬂationary inertia, since ceteris paribus they reoptimize their prices by observing their past
real marginal cost; 2) given the increase in government spending, demand increases and, consequently, so does
the production of goods sold by ﬁrms in monopolistic competition. This increase in production implies a greater
demand for labor, pushing real wages up, which leads ﬁrms to increase the real marginal cost. A posteriori, the
increment of real marginal cost impacts the prices of goods, leading to inﬂation.

The closest results for inﬂation and interest rates were found in Fragetta and Kirsanova (2010), Kliem et al
(2016) for Italy and Cebi (2012) for Turkey. The temporary increase in inﬂation in the AM/PF regimes is lower
than that in other regimes. Hence, nominal interest rates increase with greater intensity, i.e., twice that observed
in the PM/AF (the most recent regime in the EMU), in which the monetary holder did not react to interest rate
increases. Meanwhile, negative real interest rate variation in the PM/AF and PM/PF regimes were registered in
Brazil. In addition, the real interest rate remains constant in the case of AM/PF, indicating the same proportion
of such changes in terms of increases in inﬂation.

However, the real interest rate in the EMU was three times the Brazilian rate during the PM/PF+ regime.
Less elastic expansionary ﬁscal policies were suggested by the transitory trajectories represented by the IRFs.
Public debt in the EMU increased to 2% (0.5% for Brazil) in relation to the steady state in the AM/PF+ regime.
This trend shows persistence, and after thirty quarters, its deviation is almost 1%, while the corresponding
response for Brazil is near zero. Public debt shows small ﬂuctuations in relation to the steady state for the EMU
and decreases between 1.5% and 2.0% for Brazil in the other regimes. In the EMU, taxes temporarily increased
in the PM/PF+ regime, while in the PM/PF-, there was a 1% of reduction. This suggests a procyclical rule, e.g.,
the output gap had a signiﬁcant rise in this regime.

Taxes had more elastic and positive responses in Brazil, registering a maximum of up to 5% in the PM/PF
regime. Furthermore, such outcomes for inﬂation, real interest rates and public debt differ from Barros and
Lima (2014). We found that taxes peaked at 3% in the EMU and 6% in Brazil during the PM/AF and PM/PF+
regimes, respectively. Comparatively, taxes increased in all regimes for the US in Davig and Leeper (2011),
particularly the PM/PF (up to 2.5%). The debt/GDP ratio rise was almost null in the PM/PF- regime in the EMU
and inelastic in Brazil. Besides, it increases instantaneously and strongly for the US in the PM/PF regime, also
veriﬁed for the interest rate. The inﬂation response in Brazil was lower. As a consequence, the nominal interest
rate was 180% in the US (PM/AF) and 50% in Brazil (AM/PF).

Considering the very last regimes for Brazil (PM/PF) and the EMU (PM/AF), Brazilian public debt has a
higher opportunity cost than that of the EMU. This is a consequence of the country’s 1) development state and
2) its debt ratio, which is almost 10% greater than similar countries and approximately 50% of GDP. Brazil also
presents fewer degrees of freedom in terms of discretionary conditions for public expenditure decreases. Our
empirical outcomes also support that it is necessary to reform the use of macroprudential tools to make them
more systematic and thus improve the defective macroeconomic EMU policy framework. In addition, the CSRs

11

must reduce the heterogeneous member states’ impacts on debt conditions to tighten ﬁscal policy.

5 Conclusion

The theoretical model of interaction and effectiveness of monetary-ﬁscal policy was built on micro foundations
and macro-essential characteristics in a New-Keynesian framework. Institutions play a fundamental role in
policy coordination, and their functioning was represented by the changes of regimes. The empirical strategy
consisted of two steps suggested that the rise in public spending increased the output gap and inﬂation in both
cases, in addition to increasing consumption and debt for the majority of regimes. Changes in the debt ratio and
government budget deﬁcits are found to be linearly and negatively correlated with growth.

The complex task of achieving ﬁscal balance in the EMU and Brazil led to public debt crises. Mainly from
2012 to 2016, PM/AF (ﬁscal theory) was observed in the EMU, which made the TSCG and CSRs necessary.
Nonetheless, the EMU must achieve the real convergence of member states for aggregate expenditure ceiling
establishes a commitment mechanism to countries forecast public expenditures. To stabilize successive primary
deﬁcits, Brazil needs urgent structural in-depth institutional reforms for the next several years. The ﬁrst step
in this agenda of transition to more accommodative debt management and a better use of ﬁscal instruments, is
pension reform. Pension reform could deliver a reduction in distortionary tax effects, before tax system reform.
Our results suggest that economic policy should be analyzed from a coordination perspective.

For economies with special characteristics such as Brazil, the opportunity cost of public choices is especially
high, while for some EMU member states, the budget constraint seems to be a concern as well. Further studies
might address how the debt crisis is endogenously transmitted to public bond risks in an open economy context.
Although not the subject of this study, the inﬂuence of the external sector must be observed with caution.
Improvements in macroprudential policy and qualitative analysis of public spending at the microeconomic level
would be welcome as well.
