Abstract: 
The aim of this paper is to study the interaction between monetary policy and prudential regulation in an 
agent-based modeling framework. Several relevant policy implications are drawn from this analysis. First, 
the  implementation  of  a  cyclical  capital  component  as  proposed  in  Basel  III  loses  its  efficacy  when 
combined with some interest rate rules. Second, interest rate smoothing is more effective than the other 
interest rate rules assessed, as it outperforms them concerning financial stability and performs as well as 
them regarding macroeconomic stability. Finally, there is  no long-run tradeoff between macroeconomic 
and financial stability regarding the assessed parameters. 
Resumo: 
O  objetivo  deste  trabalho  é  estudar  a  interação  entre  política  monetária  e  regulação  prudencial  em  um 
modelo baseado em agentes. Várias implicações relevantes relativas a política econômica emergem desta 
análise. Primeiro, a implementação de um componente cíclico de capital, tal como proposto em Basileia 
III, perde sua eficácia quando combinado com algumas regras de taxas de juros. Segundo, o smoothing da 
taxa  de  juros  mostrou-se  mais  efetivo  que  outras  regras  de  taxas  de  juros,  já  que  supera  as  mesmas 
relativamente  a  estabilidade  financeira  e  é  tão  eficaz  quanto  as  demais  no  que  tange  a  estabilidade 
macroeconômica.  Finalmente,  não  há  um  trade-off  entre  estabilidade  macroeconômica  e  financeira 
relativamente aos parâmetros avaliados.

1.  Introduction 
The 2008 financial crisis promoted a revival of the debate on the interaction between the real and 
 
financial  sectors.  Although  some  arguments,  as  the  financial  accelerator  proposed  by  Bernanke  and 
Gertler (1995), had already pointed out the existence of transmission channels from one sector to another, 
the crisis suggested that such interlinks could be much more complex than initially thought. It left clear 
that small disturbances in one sector, through essentially nonlinear relationships, could be amplified and 
spread across both.  Indeed, although the turmoil had its roots in U.S. subprime crisis, it has crossed the 
border of the financial sector, bringing heavy losses to the real economy. 
Before the crisis,  the reigning view concerning  macroeconomic policy  was that monetary policy 
 
and prudential regulation could pursue their goals – macroeconomic and financial stability, respectively – 
acting  independently,  without  any  need  of  coordination.  According  to  this  dominant  paradigm,  a 
monetary  policy  based  on  inflation  targeting  and  flexible  exchange  rates  and  a  financial  regulation 
grounded on microprudential measures would accomplish their objectives (Canuto and Cavallari, 2013).  
 
More recently, the balance started to be tipped in favor of a more harmonious interaction between 
monetary policy and prudential regulation. In fact, through linkages between real and financial variables, 
one  policy  may  affect  the  other’s  target,  sometimes  in  an  undesirable  way.  For  instance,  by  pursuing 
macroeconomic  stabilization  in  a  recession  scenario,  monetary  policy  may  reduce  the  interest  rate. 
However,  low  interest  rates  may  lead  to  less  banks’  incentive  to  monitor  borrowers,  over-leverage  in 
banks  and  the  bearing  of  higher  risks  by  agents  in  order  to  achieve  higher  returns,  bringing  threats  to 
financial  stability  (IMF,  2013).  Hence,  the  stand-alone  execution  of  policies  may  lead  to  unsatisfactory 
outcomes.  
 
To handle this issue  of policy coordination, existing macroeconomic models  should  be endowed 
with  an  attribute  which  proved  to  be  important  in  the  last  crisis:  the  ability  to  tackle  with  nonlinear 
interdependencies  between  real  and  financial  variables.  In  the  case  of  Dynamic  Stochastic  General 
Equilibrium  (DSGE)-type  models,  the  main  workhorse  of  most  central  banks,  this  is  done  through  the 
incorporation of financial frictions (BCBS, 2012). This allows the study of optimal combinations between 
monetary  policy  and  prudential  regulation  within  the  DSGE  framework,  as  has  been  done  recently  by 
some  researchers  (e.g.,  Agénor  et  al.,  2013;  Beau  et  al.,  2011;  Goodhart  et  al.,  2013;  Lambertini  et  al., 
2013).  
 
Nonetheless, DSGE models have some inherent characteristics which limit their usefulness to the 
assessment of policy actions. As discussed above, a key element to grasp the occurrence of crashes is the 
understanding of nonlinear feedbacks among financial and real variables. Nevertheless, the incorporation 
of  nonlinearities  in  DSGE  models  is  quite  limited,  as  they  are  usually  solved  through  log-linearization 
around a unique steady state. Furthermore, the embodying of some endogenous elements responsible for 
the propagation of the crisis, as irrational behavior and inefficient markets, is hard in DSGE models, due 
to  their assumption of forward-looking  rational  behavior (Canuto  and Cavallari, 2013).  Indeed, in  these 
models, the risk is brought in by exogenous shocks. Additionally, the hypothesis of perfect rationality and 
optimizing  behavior  is  even  more  unrealistic  during  crisis,  as  these  abilities  depend  on  historical 
relationships which no longer hold (Bookstaber, 2012).  
 
Another  strategy  has  been  the  development  of  new  approaches.  One  of  the  most  promising 
alternative  approaches  is  the  Agent  Based  (AB)  modeling.1  AB  modeling  conceives  the  economy  as  a 
complex  system,  defined  by  the  presence  of  emergent  properties,  that  is,  an  aggregate  behavior 
remarkably  distinct  from  the  simple  extrapolation  of  units’  behavior  (Krugman,  1996).  In  the  AB 
modeling  framework,  agents  (consumers,  firms  etc.)  are  rationally  limited  computational  entities.  They 
interact  with  each other following simple behavioral  rules, giving rise to  nonlinear patterns. Such  rules, 
grounded on incentives and information, may evolve according to their fitness – the payoff they provide 
to the agents adopting them. In this case, the model is called evolutionary. Once the initial conditions and 
parameters of the model are established, the modeler can observe how the system evolves over time.  
                                                 
1  By  AB  models  we  are  referring  to  computational  agent-based  models.  There  are  also  models  of  heterogeneous  interacting 
agents, solvable analytically through technics coming from statistical physics or Markov chains (Gallegatti and Kirman, 2012).

AB  models  have  some  advantages  over  DSGE  models  regarding  the  assessment  of  economic 
policy.  According  to  Fagiolo  and  Roventini  (2012),  such  advantages  belong  to  two  classes:  theory  and 
empirics. From the theoretical point of view, as they are not a priori required to be analytically solvable, 
they  allow  the  relaxing  of  several  simplifying  assumptions  (e.g.,  equilibrium  and  rational  expectations) 
necessary to mathematical tractability. Their disengagement from analytical solvability makes them cope 
with  nonlinearities  much  better  than  DSGE  models.  This  flexibility  is  the  base  of  their  empirical 
advantage;  it  enables  them  to  be  much  more  realistic  than  DSGE  models  in  the  case  of  inputs 
(assumptions more similar to the observed ones), as well as concerning the outputs (replication of stylized 
facts of interest). 
 
Policy experiments with AB models are typically done in the following way. First, the AB model 
is designed to reproduce relevant stylized facts of the policy target (e.g., price level). Then, it is gauged 
how the implementation or changes in some policy parameter (e.g., interest rate) impact the behavior of 
such  variable  (Fagiolo  and  Rovetini,  2012).  The  possibility  of  implementing  a  wide  range  of  policy 
measures  turns  AB  modeling  very  attractive  for  the  performance  of  policy  exercises,  as  has  been  done 
extensively in recent years.2  
 
The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  study  the  interaction  between  monetary  policy  and  prudential 
regulation  in  an  AB  modeling  framework.  In  the  model  proposed  here,  firms  borrow  funds  from  the 
banking system in an economy regulated by a central bank. The central bank is responsible for carrying 
out monetary policy, by setting the interest rate, and  banking prudential regulation. Among the multiple 
tools  available  for  prudential  regulation,  we  deal  with  a  specific  one  in  this  paper,  namely,  the  capital 
requirement  through  the  setting  of  a  cyclical  buffer.  Different  combinations  of  interest  rate  and  capital 
requirement  rules  are  carefully  evaluated  regarding  macroeconomic  and  financial  stability.  The  former 
depends negatively on output and price volatility and the latter is measured by the bad debt-to-credit ratio. 
While monetary policy employs Taylor-type interest rate rules, the capital requirement rules involve the 
establishment of a cyclical component, as proposed in the Basel III agreement. In the end, our purpose is 
to  gain  qualitative  insights  on  the  suitable  combinations  between  monetary  policy  and  prudential 
regulation.  
 
AB  modeling  has  been  extensively  applied  by  researchers  to  analyze  the  impacts  of  monetary 
policy on the economy. Usually, effects of monetary policy are explored through changes in the interest 
rate, as in Dosi et al. (2012). In some studies (Delli Gatti et al., 2005; Raberto et al., 2008; Mandel et al., 
2010),  such  changes  are  driven  by  Taylor-type  rules.  Prudential  regulation  has  also  been  the  object  of 
study of AB models. Teglio et al. (2012) and Cincotti et al. (2012) study the impact of capital requirement 
rules  on  the  economy  employing  the  EURACE  model3.  Krug  et  al.  (2014)  developed  a  stock-flow 
consistent  AB  model  to  assess  the  effects  of  the  main  components  of  Basel  III  on  financial  stability. 
Nonetheless, as far as we know, no available study is devoted to test different combinations of monetary 
policy  and  prudential  regulation  within  the  AB  modeling  framework.  Similar  exercises  were  conducted 
mainly  through the use  of DSGE models, as  referenced above.  A noteworthy  exception is  Barnea et  al. 
(2015),  which  developed  an  overlapping-generations  model  to  analyze  the  interaction  between  these 
policies. However, we believe that AB models, due to their greater flexibility to cope with nonlinearities, 
can shed new and relevant light on this issue.  
 
In addition to this introduction, this paper has more four parts. Section 2 outlines the model, while 
results of simulations concerning the baseline case are shown in Section 3. Meanwhile, Section 4 contains 
an  assessment  of  various  combinations  of  monetary  policy  and  prudential  regulation,  considering  their 
performance regarding both macroeconomic and financial stability. Concluding remarks are presented in 
the last section.  
 
2.  Structure of the model 

                                                 
2 See the excellent review in Fagiolo and Roventini (2012).  
3 EURACE is a large-scale, multi-sector agent-based model and simulator, which is under development since 2006 within an 
EU-funded research grant (Cincotti et al., 2011).

The model is composed by three groups of agents: firms, which produce consumption goods, the 
 
banking system, which provides credit to firms and receive deposits from firms and firm-owners, and the 
central bank, which is in charge of setting the base interest rate and the capital requirement ratio. 
 
This model has several ingredients of other models, such as Delli Gatti et al. (2010) and Dosi et al. 
(2013), in addition to several novel features. Indeed, our purpose is not to contribute methodologically to 
the literature on the agent-based economic modeling framework, but rather to explore a specific issue (the 
coordination  between  monetary  policy  and  prudential  regulation)  within  such  framework.  The  main 
feature  of  the  model  herein  is  the  supply/demand  mutual  restriction.  An  individual  firm’s  sales  are  a 
fraction of aggregate demand, but constrained by its own production. Hence, an individual firm’s output 
can  be  equal,  lower  (engendering  unfilled  demand)  or  higher  (engendering  unsold  production)  than  the 
firm’s  share  in  aggregate  demand.  It  is  supposed  that  firms  operate  in  an  imperfect  information 
environment, which allows them to set different prices. Market shares are a function of the corresponding 
markups:  firms  setting  relatively  lower  markups  increase  their  market  share.  Firms  with  negative  net 
worth are expelled from the model, and any bankrupt firm is replaced by a new one.  
 
On  the  financial  side,  firms’  demand  for  credit  with  the  banking  system  follows  the  “dynamic 
trade-off theory” proposed by Riccetti  et al. (2013), meaning that firms have a long-run leverage target. 
Firms’  credit  demand  is  fulfilled  following  a  pecking  order  according  to  their  net  worth.  The  banking 
system sets a different interest rate to each firm  according to its own soundness and  the firm’s leverage 
level. 
As  it  turns  out,  there  is  interdependence  among  the  individual  firms’  financial  robustness.  It 
 
operates through two channels. The first one is  the banking credit.  If a firm goes bankrupt,  the banking 
system’s net worth shrinks. As the maximum total credit is a multiple of the banking system’s net worth, 
the  available  credit  will  be  lower  in  the  next  period,  thus  eventually  preventing  other  firms  from 
producing  more.  The  second  such  channel  is  a  demand  externality.  By  producing  less,  firms  reduce 
aggregate demand, thus affecting the other firms’ revenues and profits.  
 
 
2.1. Accounting identities 
 
There  is  an  aggregate  consistency  between  assets,  liabilities  and  financial  resources  circulating 
among  the  components  of  the  model.  Firms’  liabilities  are  composed  by  net  worth,  NW,  and  loans,  B. 
Firms’ asset is capital, K. The banking system has, in the liability side, net worth, NWB, and deposits, D, 
while its assets are formed by loans, B, and voluntary, non-remunerated, reserves kept at the central bank, 
R. Firm-owners receive a fraction of profits as dividends, A. As in Delli Gatti and Desiderio (2014), we 
assume  that  there  is  no  currency  in  the  model,  with  all  funds  taking  the  form  of  inside  money.  Firms 
deposit  their  net  worth  at  the  banking  system  and  firm-owners’  dividends  totalize  their  deposits  in  the 
.  Loans  come  back  to  the  banking  system  as  new  deposits.  The  aggregate  equality 
banking  system, 
between  assets  and  liabilities  implies  that 
.  All  these  accounting  relationships  are 
represented in Table 1.

nominal wage and L is hired labor, is paid by firms and received by workers. A share of nominal profits is

received  by  firm-owners  as  dividends.  Nominal  debt  commitments, 
rate, flow from firms to the banking system. Nominal output, 
, where p is the price level and Y is the 
real output, is consumed by workers and firm-owners or stored.  
 
2.2. Firms 
 
A  large  number  of  firms,  indexed  by  i=1,…,  N,  produce  a  consumption  good  using  labor  and 
capital.  It  is  assumed that  firms operate under conditions  of imperfect  information  in  order to  allow for 
price heterogeneity.4 The output of each firm

There is a perfectly elastic supply of labor so an individual firm can hire as much labor as it wants 
. It is assumed that 

the  labor  contract  signed  by  firms  and  workers  establish  a  minimum  real  wage.  Therefore,  there  is  a 
reasonable limit to the possibility that financially fragile firms improve their financial situation as a result 
of  a  sharp  decline  in  real  wage  costs  (recall  that  labor  productivity  is  constant).  The  real  wage, 
, 

where 

 is nominal wage and 

 is the price level, has as lower bound a fraction ψ<1 of the initial real 

wage, 

. Therefore, the nominal wage, which is uniform across firms, is given by:

fraction of profits paid by the firm to its owner as dividends, which is uniform across firms, and π is the 
aggregate  nominal  profit  of  firms.  Thus,  we  assume  that  workers  consume  all  their  income  and  firm-
owners’ dividends are saved to be entirely spent in the next period.  
 

The nominal profit of an individual firm is given by:

The first term of the expression above is the firm’s revenue. It corresponds to its share, 

, of the 

aggregate demand, but it cannot be greater than its nominal production. Unsold production corresponds to 
inventories, 
. Remaining demand, if any, is confronted with firms’ inventories 

always  considering 

  until  its  complete  fulfillment  or  the  total  depletion  of  inventories.  Goods 

depreciate completely in one period, thus  every  firm starts  any  period with  no inventories. Firms’  costs

 and 

 is logarithm of the aggregate demand. The above expression can be interpreted in 

the  following  way:  if  the  firm  loses  market  share,  it  will  try  to  recover  it  by  reducing  its  markup  (see 
equation 7 below); moreover, a fall in aggregate demand also means lower profits, and the firm will adopt 
the same strategy in order to increase its market share and hence keeps its revenues. An individual firm’s 
market share evolves according to the following rule inspired in Dosi et al. (2013):

where 

 is the average markup at period t. Consequently, more competitive firms increase their market 

share.  
 

Meanwhile, the dynamics of the individual net worth is given by 

. At 

any period, firms  with  a negative net  worth  are  expelled from  the model. For simplicity, the number of 
firms  is  kept  constant.  The  sum  of  the  market  share  of  bankrupt  firms  is  randomly  distributed  among 
entrant firms. The other attributes of entrant firms (leverage target, net worth and markup) are drawn from

.  Thus,  the  banking  system  is  required  by  the  central  bank  to  keep  a  minimum  net  worth 

over the loans ratio equal to  k. The maximum flow of credit at  period t, 

, is given by the difference 

between the maximum credit supply allowed and the funds already lent: 

  

(8). 

 
We  suppose  that  the  firms’  capital  structure  is  determined  by  the  “dynamic  trade-off  theory” 
(Riccetti et al., 2013). The “trade-off theory” (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Myers, 1977) is based on the 
trade-off between the costs and benefits of debt, implying that firms choose a leverage level, defined as 
the  debt/net  worth  ratio.  Riccetti  et  al.  (2013)  proposed  a  dynamic  version  of  this  theory,  according  to 
which  the  adjustment  of  leverage  towards  a  long-run  target  is  governed  by  market  frictions.  The  credit 
demanded by firm i at period t is given by: 

 

(9). 

 

In the equation above, 

 denotes the desired leverage. Therefore, if the stock of debt of the firm 

in the beginning of the period is below the maximum it is willing to borrow  (

), it will ask for 

more loans. The desired leverage level evolves according to the following behavioral rule:

 is constrained to 10% per period, which is intended to impose enough 

cautiousness on agents’ willingness to adjust their desired leverage. A rise in the demand for their output

Therefore, the banking system receives the debt commitments of the firms with positive net worth

bankrupt  firms  follows  Delli  Gatti  et  al.  (2007):

3.   Simulations: the passive policy case 
 
In  this  section,  we  run  simulations  considering  that  economic  policy  (monetary  policy  and 
prudential regulation) is merely passive. Therefore, the policy instruments k and 
 are exogenous rather 
than  endogenously  updated  according  to  some  adaptive  rule.  The  parameters  and  initial  conditions  are 
reported in Table 3.7  
 
3.1. Baseline simulations 
 
Figures  1  and  2  displays  some  basic  statistics  generated  by  the  model,  where  we  considered  the 
average  of  100  simulations.  It  can  be  seen  that,  after  a  transient  period,  the  system  oscillates  around  a 
relatively  stable  long-run  level.  In  the  initial  periods,  the  more  competitive  firms  grab  a  bigger  slice  of 
aggregate  demand and  grow faster than the other firms,  which can be seen by the increasing variability 
concerning net worth and markup (Figure 3). After a big bust around period 80, when a great number of 
less competitive firms is eliminated, firms became more uniform, as entrant firms are random  copies of 
the  incumbent  ones.  Without  remarkable  differences  regarding  firms’  competitiveness,  as  measured  by 
their markups, oscillations became less pronounced. Inequality regarding firms’ net worth and real output, 
as  measured  by  the  Herfindahl-Hirschman  Index,  is  very  low,  although  it  increases  after  the  transient 
period.  
 
There  is  no  long-run  growth,  which  is  expected  given  the  lack  of  any  source  of  growth  (e.g., 
increase  in  the  number  of  firms  or  in  labor  productivity).  Similarly  to  other  agent-based  models,  the 
model herein is able to endogenously generate business cycles. When the economy is in the boom period, 
firms revise upward their leverage target, engendering higher levels of production and subsequent growth 

                                                 
6 In all simulation runs, no banking system bankruptcy was observed.  
7 No validation exercise on empirical data was performed, but using reasonable parameter values was always a  major concern. 
In fact,  most of the parameter values  were drawn  from existing studies (e.g., Riccetti et  al., 2013). We run simulations on a 
range of reasonable values and chose a set of parameters whose results were not counterintuitive on empirical grounds.

ensuring  the  necessary  supply  of  credit.  Such  solid  banking  system’  equity  position  pushes  the  interest 
rate  down,  while  prices  are  pushed  up.  The  credit  expansion,  combined  with  decreasing  returns  to  net 
worth, spawns a greater credit-to-output ratio. In the descending phase, firms cut down markups to try to 
keep their market shares and avoid higher losses. The consequent shrink in the leverage level reinforces 
the  reduction  of  output  and  aggregate  demand.  Eventually,  some  firms  go  bankrupt,  which  reduces  the 
banking system’s net worth. This can cause credit rationing, which creates a new source of instability.  
 
Note that the system is adaptive, in the sense that ill-suited firms are expelled from the model and 
new  firms  are  random  copies  of  the  surviving  ones.  Therefore,  the  financial  fragility  of  the  system 
decreases  over  time.  The  bad  debt  over  total  credit  stabilizes  around  1.5%.  The  number  of  firms 
eliminated  in  each  period  also  goes  down  until  around  2%  of  the  total  number  of  firms.  In  general, 
bankrupt firms are young, with an average age not higher than 10 periods, while this value is below 5 in 
the long-run. Inventories reach 8% of total output. All these dynamics are shown in Figure 4.  
 
3.2. Interest rate shock 
 

We then run simulations including an interest  rate shock, in  the form  of a temporary  increase  in 
.  The  base  interest  rate  is  the  instrument  used  by  the  central  bank  to  implement  its  monetary  policy. 
Thus, it is worth exploring how changes in this variable affect the real economy, as well as the price level 
and the financial fragility, which is measured here as the bad debt-to-aggregate credit ratio. 
  and,  after  50 
 
periods,  it  turns  back  to  its  previous  level.  Note  that  the  model  replicates  two  kinds  of  tradeoffs:  the 
inflation/output  tradeoff  and  the  inflation/financial  stability  tradeoff  (Figure  5).  Increases  in  the  base 
interest  rate  reduce  profits,  thus  affecting  negatively  consumption  (through  dividends)  and  output 
(through  retained  profits).  Cascade  effects  take  place,  provoking  further  decreases  in  aggregate  demand 
and  production.  In  order  to  minimize  profit  losses,  firms  reduce  markups  to  try  to  gain  market  share, 
which  pushes  prices  down.  Lower  profits  increase  the  occurrence  of  bankruptcies,  thus  worsening 
financial stability. An opposite mechanism takes place in case of a negative interest rate shock. 

We  considered  that,  at  period  1,000,  the  base  interest  rate  varies  positively  by 

For large absolute values of 

 (above 25% of base interest rate), the macroeconomic effects of 
negative and positive shocks became asymmetric, being much stronger in  the former case.  In  fact, they 
preclude  the  system  from  returning  to  its  original  path.  This  phenomenon  does  not  seem  to  have  much 
robust empirical support, but it can be logically and intuitively explained by characteristics of the model. 
After the transient period, eliminated firms have an average level of leverage which is smaller than that of 
the incumbent ones (Figure 2). With a positive interest rate shock, the resulting fall in aggregate demand 
forces  leverage  down.  However,  financial  fragility  increases,  which  attenuates    such  decrease  in  the 
leverage level and, consequently, in the output production: there will be more low-leveraged firms being 
eliminated and more high-leveraged firms being created, as entrant firms are random copies of incumbent 
ones. Meanwhile, a similar mechanism which can attenuate the change in leverage does not exist in the 
case of a negative interest rate shock. 
 
4.  Implementing monetary policy and prudential regulation 
 
In this section, we explore how the system is affected by an active economic policy. We assume 
that the central bank has two targets: macroeconomic stability (hereafter, MS) and financial stability (FS). 
To reach each one of these objectives, it relies on two instruments, respectively, the base interest rate 
 
and the capital requirement ratio k.  
 

The base interest rate is set according to a Taylor-type rule:

.  This  establishes  the  rule  proposed  by 

Taylor (1993) in his seminal paper.  
Interest-rate smoothing (IRS): 

, 

ii. 

, 

. In the actual conduct of monetary 

policy, central banks are frequently prone to adopt an inertial monetary policy, adjusting partially 
the policy interest rate. Clarida et al. (2000) estimate the smoothing parameter as ranging from 0.7 
to 0.9. Some researchers claim that this can be an optimal behavior on the part of the central bank. 
Sack and Wieland (2000), for instance, consider that interest rate smoothing may be optimal due 
to  three  features  of  the  environment  in  which  monetary  policy  is  conducted:  forward-looking 
behavior  by  market  participants,  measurement  error  of  key  macroeconomic  variables  and 
uncertainty regarding structural parameters.  
“Leaning against the wind” interest rate (LAW): 

. There is an intense 

, 

, 

discussion about whether monetary policy should react when an asset price bubble is identified or 
just after the bubble burst – the “lean versus clean” debate. The recent financial crisis has provided 
some arguments in favor of the first option (Canuto and Cavallari, 2013). We explore this rule by 
using a variable associated with the booming of asset bubbles, viz. the credit expansion. Then we 
incorporate to the TTR a component which is sensible to the credit-to-output gap. 

Regarding the capital requirement, we consider that it now incorporates a cyclical component 

: 

    

(14). 

As originally proposed by  the  Basel  III  accord (BCBS, 2010),  we  establish

, while

varies according to the credit-to-output gap:  

 

 

(15), 

where 

 is the credit-to-output gap and L (H) is the lower (higher) threshold. In BCBS (2010), 

the suggested values for L and H, which we adopt here, are 0.02 and 0.10, respectively.  
In the following analysis, this first rule is called the Basel III rule (BAS). Alternatively, we test a 
 
second capital requirement rule, which is adopted, for instance, in Agénor et al. (2013). Here, the capital 

requirement  is 

,  with 

.  In  the  following  analysis,  we  refer  to  this  rule  as  the 

unbounded capital requirement rule (UNB).  
 

Departing  from  UNB,  we  explore  two  more  rules.  Firstly,  we  analyze  the  effect  of  the  capital 

requirement  smoothing  (CRS)  rule,  by  setting 

.  The 

latter 

is 

underpinned by the same rationale of IRS. Capital requirement smoothing is a way to tackle the problem 
of  procyclicality  of  capital  requirement  rules  under  the  Internal  Ratings  Based  (IRB)  approach,  which 
includes  Basel  II  accord  (Hordy  and  Howells,  2006).  Finally,  the  use  of  the  deviation  of  the  credit-to-
output ratio from  its trend in  setting of capital  requirement is  criticized by  many authors. Repullo  et  al.

for  many  countries  the  credit-to-GDP  gap  is  negatively  correlated  with  GDP  growth.  Some  studies 
suggest that the credit growth rate is a better reference point. Therefore, we implement the credit growth 
capital requirement rule (CGR), according to which the capital requirement ratio is established according 
,  where  BT  is  the  potential  credit,  which  is  also  estimated  through  the 

to 

Hodrick-Prescott filter.  
 
As  stated  earlier,  the  central  bank  is  concerned  with  macroeconomic  stability  and  financial 
stability.  We  assume  that  the  former  depends  negatively  on  the  volatility  of  output  and  prices,  as 
measured  by  their  coefficients  of  variation,  while  the  latter  is  measured  by  the  ratio  bad  debt-to-total 
credit.  We  explore  how  the  behavior  of  these  three  variables  (coefficient  of  variation  of  real  output, 
coefficient  of  variation  of  prices  and  average  bad  debt-to-credit)  is  affected  by  each  combination  of 
monetary policy rule and capital requirement rule.  
 
4.1. Results 
 
Tables 4-5 show the results of simulations. For each combination, it was run 100 simulations of 
1,000 periods each. The values shown in the cells correspond to the difference between the average of the 
respective  combination  and  that  of  the  baseline  case  (fixed  capital  requirement  and  interest  rate).  We 
considered two cases: the mean across all the 1,000 periods (Table 4) and a similar series which excludes 
a transient phase comprising the first 200 periods (Table 5). We set r* = 0.02, χ = 0.5 and θC = 0.5 (0.1 for 
CGR). For the “leaning against the wind” rule, three values of θ3 were tested: 0.1, 0.5 and 1. 
 
Our results show that the available instruments are individually effective.  In fact, all the cyclical 
capital and interest rate rules, when applied alone, reduce their target variables (bad debt-to-credit in the 
first  case,  coefficient  of  variation  of  output  and  price  in  the  second  one).  However,  in  some  cases  this 
efficiency  has  a  temporal  dimension.  The  “leaning  against  the  wind”  interest  rate  rule  (LAW),  when 
implemented alone, does not exhibit a long-run effect (ignoring the transient period); it just alleviates the 
output  and  price  variation  during  the  transient  phase.  Only  few  combinations  present  a  long-run  effect 
regarding price volatility. It is worth noting that some cyclical capital rules (notably UNB and CRS) have 
short-run positive effects on macroeconomic stability.  
 
Some relevant policy implications can be inferred from the results. The cyclical capital component 
as suggested in the Basel III accord (BAS), notwithstanding being efficient when applied alone, loses its 
effectiveness  when  combined  with  an  interest  rate  rule.  A  possible  explanation  is  that  changes  in  the 
interest  rate  require,  in  order  to  avoid  a  worsening  of  financial  stability,  a  change  in  the  capital 
requirement greater than that allowed in the BAS case, where the buffer is limited to 2.5%. Moreover, it 
can  be  seen  that  the  unbounded  capital  requirement  rules  (UNB,  CRS  and  CGR)  perform  very  well  in 
articulation with interest rate rules, which provides further support to the possible explanation suggested 
above. 
 
The “leaning against the wind” rule proved very damaging to financial stability in the short-term, 
but may promote it in the long-run when the interest rate is not too sensitive to credit changes (θ3 = 0.1) 
and when it is combined with unbounded cyclical capital rules. Regarding the cyclical capital  rules, the 
unbounded options (UNB, CGR and CRS) do not present any noticeable difference among themselves.  
 
The best  results for financial stability involve the smoothing of interest  rate  changes  (IRS). This 
option  proved  slightly  worse  than  other  Taylor-type  rules  regarding  macroeconomic  stability,  but  this 
difference is not significant. Woodford (1999, 2001) discusses the optimality of interest rate smoothing. 
In  fact,  it  reduces  the  likelihood  of  reaching  the  zero  nominal  interest  rate  floor  in  a  low  interest  rate 
environment and decreases the average size of distortions caused by high interest rates (Woodford, 1999). 
Furthermore,  if  agents  are  forward-looking  in  such  a  way  that  current  aggregate  demand  is  affected  by 
future interest rates, monetary policy inertia is optimal (Woodford, 2001).  
 
This  result  goes  in  hand  with  the  standpoint  of  some  studies  according  to  which  interest  rate 
smoothing enhances financial stability. It is claimed that, as banks convert variable rate liabilities in fixed 
rate assets, inertia in interest rates is favorable to their solvency (Padoa-Scioppa, 2002). Furthermore, our 

 

10 

TtCtBBkklnln1*results corroborate the evidence found in Smith and van Egteren (2005), according to which IRS performs 
better with unbounded capital requirement rules. These authors point out that, if interest rate smoothing is 
in  place,  a  higher  capital  requirement  should  be  imposed,  in  order  to  avoid  moral  hazard  problems 
stemming from the fact that banks are prone to be more risk-taking in a stable environment.  
 
4.2. Extending the analysis: varying θC and χ 
 
From  the  analysis  above,  it  follows  that  two  parameters  are  crucial.  First,  the  preceding  results 
suggest that the sensitiveness of the cyclical capital requirement to credit variations (θC) should be strong 
enough to countervail changes in interest rate in order to avoid a worsening in financial stability. Second, 
the interest rate smoothing (0 < χ < 1) overcomes both the fixed interest rate (χ = 1) and the traditional 
Taylor rule (χ = 0) cases. Therefore, it is worth exploring a wider range of values of these parameters.  
We then changed θC between 0 and 1 in increments of 0.1. We used the UNB rule combined with 
 
three interest rate rules: TTR, IRS and LAW. For each value of the parameter 100 simulations were  run 
and  the  average  of  the  variables  of  interest  (mean  bad  debt,  coefficient  of  variation  of  real  output  and 
coefficient  of  variation  of  price)  was  calculated.  The  same  procedure  was  adopted  regarding  χ  with  a 
ceiling of 0.9. In this case, an interest rate rule (IRS) was combined with three cyclical capital component 
rules (UNB, CRS and CGR). In both situations, we analyze the no-transience-phase case and the one in 
which the transience phase comprises the first 200 periods.  
 
Figure  6  shows  that,  when  a  transient  period  is  considered,  there  appears  to  be  a  nonlinear  U-
shaped  relationship  between the variables  and θC. The  fit in  the convex curve is  poor when the interest 
rate  smoothing  is  applied,  considering  the  financial  stability,  which  is  shown  by  the  low  adjusted  R2 
(Table  6).  Such  result  is  expected,  as  in  this  case  the  financial  stability  stems  essentially  from  the 
smoothed interest rate and relies less on θC. However, in the transient phase case, while average bad debt 
keeps its convex relationship  with  θC, the variables related to  macroeconomic stability become concave 
functions  of  the  parameter.  This  can  be  explained  in  light  of  the  adaptive  process  which  takes  place 
during the transient phase. For values of θC below the turning point level (around 0.7), the elimination of 
less adapted firms – that is, those with lower net worth – due to a tightening of the credit supply is more 
severe. As entrant firms are random copies of incumbent ones, this increases firms’ average net worth. As 
a result, the peak of the aggregate output and price level is more pronounced.  
 
Regarding  the  smoothing  parameter  (Figure  7),  a  similar  result  is  observed.  In  the  long-run,  an 
increase  in  χ  contributes  to  greater  financial  stability  and  its  effects  on  macroeconomic  stability  are 
positive or negligible depending on the case. But in the short term output and price volatility is a convex 
function of the parameter. Again this can be understood by looking at the dynamics of the system in its 
early  stages.  When  smoothed,  the  interest  rate  does  not  rise  by  as  much  as  it  would  be  necessary  to 
dampen output and prices in the ascendant phase of the cycle.  
 
5.  Concluding remarks 
In this paper, we set forth an AB model well suited to performing macroeconomic policy analysis. 
 
The main purpose is to derive qualitative results regarding the appropriate coordination between monetary 
policy and prudential regulation within this framework.  
 
The model succeeds in replicating several important macroeconomic stylized facts (e.g., business 
cycles), as well as two tradeoffs which relevant to the issues addressed here: the inflation/output tradeoff 
and the inflation/financial stability tradeoff. A positive interest rate shock pushes both output and prices 
down. Furthermore, the resulting decrease in firms’ profits increases the likelihood of bankruptcies, thus 
threatening financial stability.  
 
We  also  explore  how  different  combinations  of  monetary  policy  and  prudential  regulation  rules 
affect  macroeconomic  and  financial  stability.  Some  relevant  policy  implications  are  drawn  from  this 
analysis.  First,  the  implementation  of  a  cyclical  capital  component  as  proposed  in  Basel  III,  while 
successful in reducing financial instability when applied alone, loses its efficacy when combined with the 
interest rate rules considered here. The reason might be that, in face of an interest rate change, it becomes 

 

11 

necessary  an  accompanying  change  in  the  capital  requirement  which  is  higher  than  that  allowed  by  the 
Basel III cyclical buffer rule.  
 
Second, interest  rate smoothing  is  more effective than the other  interest  rate rules assessed, as it 
outperforms them concerning financial stability and performs as well as them regarding macroeconomic 
stability.  Moreover,  interest  rate  smoothing  achieves  better  results  when  combined  with  unbounded 
capital  requirement rules. A possible explanation comes from  Smith  and  van Egteren (2005): banks are 
more prone to adopt a risky behavior in a stable environment, so that a higher capital requirement should 
be implemented when the smoothing interest rate is in place. 
Finally, there is no long-run tradeoff regarding the sensitiveness of the cyclical capital component 
 
to  the credit-to-output ratio,  as well as the smoothing interest  rate parameter.  In the long-run, there is  a 
nonlinear U-shaped relationship between the variables measuring financial and macroeconomic stability 
(bad debt-to-credit ratio and output and price volatility) and  the cyclical  capital  component to  credit-to-
output ratio. Furthermore, financial stability is well fitted by a concave function of the smoothing interest 
rate  parameter,  whereas  the  same  parameter  has  a  positive  or  negligible  effect  on  macroeconomic 
stability. Short-run tradeoffs appear due to the adaptive nature of the model.  
 
Needless  to  say,  all  these  qualitative  results  should  be  taken  with  caution.  Agent-based  models 
suffer from over-parametrization and their results are very sensitive to parameters and initial conditions. 
However, similar caution applies to  other  types of  models addressing the same issues. Furthermore, the 
model set forth here is underpinned by an aggregate consistency between stocks and flows, a coherence of 
assumptions and the replication of stylized facts. Therefore, we believe that agent-based models along the 
lines of the one developed in this paper can be an important tool in the assessment of economic policies, 
acting complementarily to existing ones.
