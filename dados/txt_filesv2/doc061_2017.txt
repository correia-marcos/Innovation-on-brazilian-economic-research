Abstract

The main objective of this paper is to measure the welfare costs related to per-
manent and transitory shocks for heterogeneous consumers. We use data from the
Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) and compute the average consumption in three
diﬀerent income groups:
low, middle and high income. We sort consumers from the
poorest to the richest and we create these three groups using income as a reference.
Then, we consider a model where consumers in diﬀerent groups face diﬀerent shocks.
Our ﬁndings indicate that the welfare costs of economic ﬂuctuations are higher than
previous works that explore heterogeneous agents argue. Moreover, our estimations
indicate that high-income consumers are more sensitive to both transitory and perma-
nent shocks than other classes of consumers.

Resumo

O objetivo principal deste trabalho é medir os custos de bem estar relacionados a choques permanentes
e transitórios para consumidores heterogêneos. Utilizamos dados da Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) e
calculamos o consumo médio em três grupos de renda diferentes: renda baixa, média e alta. Nós classiﬁcamos os
consumidores dos mais pobres aos mais ricos e criamos esses três grupos usando a renda como referência. Então,
consideramos um modelo em que os consumidores em diferentes grupos enfrentam diferentes choques. Nossas
descobertas indicam que os custos de bem-estar das ﬂutuações econômicas são maiores do que os trabalhos
anteriores que exploram agentes heterogêneos argumentam. Além disso, nossas estimativas indicam que os
consumidores de alta renda são mais sensíveis a choques transitórios e permanentes do que outras classes de
consumidores.

Introduction

Lucas (1987) argues that the welfare cost due to business cycles is small, about 0.04%
of personal consumption per-capita. Lucas made three basic assumption: (i) there is a
representative consumer, (iii) the welfare function is time-separable and iso-elastic (iii) the
log of annual per capita consumption is serially uncorrelated and normally distributed around
a linear trend. Subsequent work measured the cost of business cycles with diﬀerent methods
and data bases. In general, these works have either changed the environment of the problem
or relaxed Lucas assumptions. Some authors changed the preference utility and achieve high
welfare cost, as example we have Van Wincoop (1994), Dolmas (1998) and Tallarini (2000).
Although they found great welfare costs, these papers are criticized by Otrok (2001) who says
that it is trivial to ﬁnd big number for the welfare cost when we can choose preferences. Our
approach is to relax the assumption of representative consumer keeping CRRA preferences.
In our model, consumers are heterogeneous with respect to income. Then, we measure
how diﬀerent class of consumers are willing to pay (in terms of consumption) to eliminate
consumption uncertainty.

There are some works that relax the hypothesis of representative consumer and compute
the welfare cost of business cycles. Imrohoroglu (1989), Krusell and Smith (1999), De Santis
(2007), Krebs (2003, 2007), and others measured the costs of ﬂuctuations in economies where
agents are heterogeneous and markets are incomplete. Although one can expect that the
costs of ﬂuctuations would be higher, as bad income shocks hurt a few households severely,
the typical ﬁnding from these studies is that the costs of ﬂuctuations are only slightly higher
or even lower than the Lucas benchmark. It is also common in all works of this group the
use of calibration techniques on some well design economic models, which implies that the
individual consumption series is derived from simulations.

The literature that uses econometric tools to estimate the welfare cost of business cycles
have important results relaxing some of the assumption of Lucas. Obstfeld (1994) points
that, for reasonable calibrations, the costs of ﬂuctuations are small even if consumption is
inﬁnitely persistent. Exploring serial correlation in consumption series, Reis (2009) ﬁnds
that a high persistence of consumption in the data severely distorts conventional measures
of welfare cost of cycles and estimates a cost of ﬂuctuations between 0.5% and 5% of per
capita consumption. Issler et al. (2008) and Issler et al. (2014) split oﬀ the cost in welfare
costs due to permanent and transitory shocks and ﬁnds even negative numbers for the costs
of ﬂuctuations. We notice that all those works build on the assumption of a representative
consumer.

Our contribution to the literature is to measure the welfare costs related to permanent
and transitory shocks in heterogeneous class of consumers using microdata. For the best of
our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst work to use data from individual consumers to estimate the
welfare cost of business cycles.1 Our approach is similar to Issler et al. (2014) estimation of a
structural time-series models with long-run constraints. We assume a structural time-series
model, where the unobserved components are assumed to be normal and uncorrelated, as in
Harvey (1985) and Koopman et al. (2009). We put our problem in a state-space form and

to execute our estimations.

use Kalman Filter to estimate the transitory and permanent components of our model.

We ﬁnd evidence that consumers have a higher costs due to permanent shocks than the
costs due to transitory shocks. A intuitive result, since permanent shock aﬀects current and
future consumption, while transitory shocks can only direct change current consumption.
Also, high-income consumers have higher costs due to economic ﬂuctuations than other
income-classes of consumers. Finally, our results indicates that the total costs of economic
ﬂuctuations are higher than the related literature suggests. In general, works that keeps the
representative consumer hypothesis use aggregate consumption data, which may hide part of
the variation in the consumption of individual (or groups of) consumers. Also, it is possible
that the literature that explore heterogeneous consumers with incomplete markets can not
identify all the variation in consumption series, or they can not account the persistence of
consumption, which is a important component of the welfare costs as Reis (2009) shows.

2 Model

We consider a economy where there is a large number of individual indexed by i = 1, 2, . . . N.
All individuals have the same utility function:

u(ct,i) =

t,i − 1
c(1−φ)
1 − φ

.

where t represents the period of consumption and φ is the relative risk aversion coeﬃcient
of an agent. Each person lives forever and discount future utility at the rate β ∈ (0, 1).
Individuals maximize the following objective function:

Following Issler et al. (2014), we decompose ln(ct,i) as the sum of a deterministic term,

a martingale trend and a stationary and ergodic cycle:

is the deterministic term of log-consumption, t,i rep-
where, ln
resents an permanent shock and µt,i is a stationary shock for individual i. Here, we make an
assumption to allow us to use the Kalman ﬁlter to estimate properties of those shocks: we
suppose that shocks are uncorrelated and have a bivariate Normal distribution:

Considering the uncorrelated shocks hypothesis, the unconditional variance of ln(ci,t) is
k. Giving that the marginal distribution of a multivariate normal

distribution is also normal distributed, we have that

t,i ∼ N (0, σ11,i);
µt,i ∼ N (0, σ22,i).

Then, we can turn oﬀ either permanent or transitory shock and calculate counterfactual
log-consumption exposed to only one kind of those shocks.

In order to ﬁnd a consumption sequence only exposed to permanent shock, cP

tion exposed only to permanent shock and the consumption exposed to all macroeconomic

3 Estimation and data

We use the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) to gather income and expenditure data
at household-level. CEX program consists of two diﬀerent surveys, the Quarterly Interview
Survey and the Diary Survey, providing data of American consumers, expenditures, income,
and consumer unit (families and single consumers) characteristics. We only look at the
Quarterly Interview Survey, which tracks consumer units large expenditures, such as major
appliances and cars, and is conducted quarterly with each consumer unit. A consumer unit
appears up to four interviews, spaced three months apart. After its ﬁnal interview, a new

5

randomly selected household replaces this consumer unit. There are six types of data ﬁles
organized by quarter. However, we focus only at the FMLI ﬁle, also referred to as the
Consumer Unit (CU) characteristics and income ﬁle, contains consumer unit characteristics,
consumer unit income, and characteristics and earnings of the reference person and of the
spouse. The ﬁle includes weights needed to calculate population estimates and variances.2
Our sample is drawn from CEX data ﬁles corresponding to the period 1996:Q1 through
2014:Q4 (the latest quarter available at the time that the paper was written). We use three
variables from CEX data ﬁles: (i) Expenditure: total expenditures last quarter; (ii) Income:
amount of wage and salary income, before deductions, received by all CU members in past
12 months; and, (iii) CU replicate weight. To adjust for inﬂation, we deﬂate income using
implicit price deﬂators for gross domestic product, and expenditures using implicit price
deﬂators for personal consumption expenditures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis of
the U.S. Department of Commerce. The base-year for the deﬂated variables is 2009.

After some exclusions, we obtain a sample with 331,974 observations.3 For each period
we sort the data by income from the lowest to the highest income, respectively, I(cid:96)t and Iht .
t be income of consumer i
After that, we aggregate consumers in three income groups. Let I i
t ∈ [I(cid:96)t, Iht/3);
in period t. Then we create the following groups: Group 1 - consumers with I i
t ∈ [2Iht/3, Iht].
t ∈ [Iht/3, 2Iht/3); and Group 3 - consumers with I i
Group 2 - consumers with I i
Finally, we compute the average of the log-consumption of each groups for each period. As a
result of this aggregation, we have three consumption time series with 76 observations.4 As
a last treatment, we remove seasonal quarter eﬀects from our data using dummy variables.
Figure 1 presents our consumption time series for diﬀerent income levels and also the

mean consumption time series.

Before we describe the technique used in the empirical work, we brieﬂy describe an
additional assumption. It would be diﬃcult to report the λ’s for a big panel of consumers,
because it would require a long time series to estimate all of those parameters. Then, we
make the following assumption: individuals from the same income group receive the same
shocks and share a equal trend. Therefore, for a group with K < N individuals, we calculate
the average of the log-consumption:

ln(1 + α1,(cid:96))t − ω2

where g represents an income group. With that assumption, the average of ln(ct,i) keeps
the same permanent and transitory shocks that individuals receive. Then, we can calculate
the λ’s described in the last section for groups of individual. It is essential to our empirical
approach.

We estimate our model in a state-space form with normal disturbances using the Kalman
Filter. Following Drukker and Gates (2011) we apply the sspace to estimate a local-level

2There is no full form for the ﬁle name FMLI. In accord to the Bureau of Labor Statistics FMLI is a ﬁle

with characteristics, income, weights, and summary level expenditures for the Consumer Unit.

3We drop individuals in the bottom and top 1% of the income distribution. We do this to avoid consumers
with extremely low income (including zero income) and because without this exclusion our time series of
group 3 was composed only by one observation in many periods.

4For our estimation of welfare costs of economic ﬂuctuations, we have the implicit assumption that

consumers do not jump from one income group to another.

Following Issler et al. (2014), we impose that permanent and transitory shocks on con-
sumption are independent, relying on the structural time-series model of Harvey (1985) and
Koopman et al. (2009). The idea is to decompose a single integrated series in a trend and a
cycle by maximum likelihood, guaranteeing consistent and asymptotically Normal parameter
estimates. Applying the local-level model to our trend-cycle decomposition of consumption
for diﬀerent income levels consists in:

In ﬁgure 2 we can see that there is a higher shift in the consumption of a group if the
group has a higher income. Also, in accord to table 1, we notice that the volatility of
permanent and transitory shocks are increasing in the income group. There are two facts
that can explain it. First, we take averages of consumers using income groups and since the
income distribution is asymmetric, the amount of people is decreasing in the income terciles.
Therefore, the average is a bigger smoother of consumption series in groups 1 and 2 than in
group 3. Second, there is a higher heterogeneity among the richest consumers than among
the poorest consumers. Thus, when we group more heterogeneous agents it is natural to ﬁnd
a more volatile time series.

Figure 2: Consumption per income level proﬁle (deseasonalized logs)

High-income consumers have the biggest welfare cost due to cycles (see table 2) in our

cost and the marginal cost are incresing on φ.6 The results are in percent of consumption,
therefore, to avoid business cycle a high-income individual would give up a fraction of his
consumption between 0.14% and 1.44%, while low-income individuals would give up some-
thing between 0.02% and 0.17% of his consumption to avoid cycles. Those numbers are
higher than the ﬁndings in Issler et al. (2014). This give us some evidence that if we con-
sider consumer heterogeneity, the costs of cycles can be higher than previous results. The
marginal welfare cost of cycles presents the same interpretation we give to the welfare cost
of cycles.

Our estimations indicate that consumers are willing to pay a higher fraction of their
consumption to avoid variations due to economic growth (permanent shocks) than they are
willing to pay to attenuate cycles. To see that, one can contrast the number in tables 2 and
3.

We ﬁnd a non-linear relation between the welfare cost associated to economic growth
variation and our groups of income. People in group 2 are less sensitive to variations in the
permanent shocks on consumption. We interpret this result as an evidence that consumers
with intermediary income have a better adaptation when shocks are permanent than people
in the other income groups. However, we should note that in absolute values even this group
are more sensitive to permanent shocks in comparison to transitory.

When we analyze the cost associated to all macroeconomic uncertainty, we observe that
the cost due to economic growth predominates over cost associate with transitory shock (see
table 4). Also, we observe that the welfare cost is an increasing function of our income
groups as observed in the welfare cost of cycles.

In general, we ﬁnd a higher welfare cost due to economic ﬂuctuations than the related
literature. Estimations of Lucas (1987) and Issler et al. (2014) present a smaller welfare cost
than our numbers, because their measure of the variance of the shocks on consumption are
smaller than the numbers in table 1. Therefore, we have a evidence that a disaggregation of
the consumption can reveal a higher welfare cost than was previous suggested.

Our results also contrast with the literature that measure the welfare cost of cycles using
heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets. In general, those papers ﬁnd a very small cost
of cycles and only in extreme cases, welfare costs due to economic ﬂuctuations reresents a

5You should note that both the cost and the marginal cost of cycles presented in section 2 do not depend

on the discount factor. Thus, we present some estimations for those number only for diﬀerent φ’s.

6Despite we follow Issler et al. (2014), we do not measure the welfare cost for φ = 20 because we do not

guarantee the convergence conditions exposed in section (2) for high-income consumers.

bigger number. For example, Krusell and Smith (1999) argues that only very poor consumers
can present a cost up to 2%.7

7However, Krusell et al. (2009) present a new evidence that welfare costs can be higher (about 1%).

10

In the appendix, we present a exercise where we increase the number of income groups.
This exercise indicates that our ﬁnding of a higher welfare cost than previous literature is
robust to a increase in the number of groups.

5 Final remarks

In this paper, we use data from individual consumers to compute the welfare cost of economic
ﬂuctuations for diﬀerent income-group agents. We use a method similar to Issler et al. (2014)
that split oﬀ the cost in welfare costs due to permanent shocks and due to transitory shocks.
Our estimation is based in a state-space model and uses Kalman Filter to identify the diﬀerent
kinds of shocks. Our estimations indicate that the welfare costs of business cycles are bigger
than previous works with similar techniques found.
In addition, we present a robustness
exercise where we increase the number of groups of income and ﬁnd a stronger result: with
a bigger number of groups, there is an increase in the welfare costs in all groups except for
the group with the higher income. We interpret this exercise as a evidence that exploring
some heterogeneity of consumers can reveal a higher measure of the welfare cost of economic
ﬂuctuations.

In general, our results indicate that the welfare cost of economic ﬂuctuations can vary
from 0.20% to 35%, but it is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd a number around 2% of consumption. We
use data from individual consumers to compute averages for groups of consumers, which
contains more variation than the aggregate consumption used in similar empirical works.
Even compared to Issler et al. (2014) - our inspiration to split the variation in two kind
of shocks - our estimations indicate a higher cost of business cycles and economic growth
variation.
It is important to note that they permit a more ﬂexible form for the relation
between shocks.

Future work can beneﬁt from our ﬁnds that the assumption of representative consumer is
not a neutral one. There is also many of our assumptions that can be relaxed in future work,
for example: (a) we only use three and four classes of consumers, maybe with more classes
there will be heterogeneity in the welfare cost of business cycles, but we believe that our
general ﬁnds will keep; (b) the independence assumption can be relaxed in order to explore
the correlation between permanent and transitory shocks.

Appendix

In this appendix, we present the results of our estimations of the welfare costs in the presence
of permanent and transitory shocks with four groups of income. We use the same procedure
to create these groups. Given the dataset where for each period consumers where sorted by
income, we create the following groups:

• Group 1: consumers with I i
• Group 2: consumers with I i
• Group 3: consumers with I i
• Group 4: consumers with I i

t ∈ [I(cid:96)t, Iht/4);
t ∈ [Iht/4, Iht/2);
t ∈ [Iht/2, 3Iht/4);
t ∈ [3Iht/4, Iht].

In table 5 we present the parameters estimated using the Kalman ﬁlter. Comparing the
results with the estimations using three groups of income, we notice that there is a decrease in
the volatility of both transitory and permanent shocks in the group with the highest income,
while there is a increase the remaining groups. As we point out in the main text, there are
two reason for this eﬀect. We are reducing the denominator used to take the averages of
groups, then in the income groups where there was a big amount of people (groups 1 and 2 in
the main text) the average is not a big smoother of the aggregate group consumption. Only
part of the heterogeneity in group 3 of the main text is inside the group 3 of this appendix.
Figure 3 shows the estimated the stochastic trend and the consumption series of all new
income groups.

Tables 6, 7 and 8 presents the estimations of the welfare costs of economic ﬂuctuations.
As a general result, we ﬁnd higher estimated welfare costs as we increase the number of the
groups of income, except for the groups with the highest income. This result makes our
exercise of breaking the assumption of a representative agent more robust. It indicates us
that expending the heterogeneity of consumers can reveal higher welfare costs of economic
ﬂuctuations.
