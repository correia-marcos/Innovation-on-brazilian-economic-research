Switching  costs  are  the  leading  cause  for  customer  lock-in  in  banking,  reducing  the  extent  of 
competition and increasing market power of suppliers. This paper tries to estimate the extent of 
such  costs,  using  a  methodology  which  does  not  require  microdata  about  customers.  The 
estimates  obtained  in  this  study—by  using  the  banks’  accounting  information  collected  in  a 
quarterly basis from 2009 to 2011—indicate there are substantial switching costs in the deposit 
market,  and  these  costs    tend  to  be  lower  for  customers  of  larger  banks.  Additionally,  there  is 
some  evidence  that  much  of  a  bank’s  market  share  is  due  to  its  continued  relationships  with 
customers  over  the  quarters  (lock-in  effect).  Thus,  the  extent  of  potential  competition  in 
Brazilian banking could be severely limited by these costs. 

Resumo:  Custos de mudança são  a causa mais importante para  a fidelização de  consumidores 
no mercado bancário, o que reduz a competição e aumenta o poder de mercado dos produtores. 
O  presente  artigo  busca  estimar  a  magnitude  destes  custos,  usando  uma  metodologia  que 
prescinde  de  microdados  dos  consumidores.  As  estimativas  aqui  obtidas  –  a  partir  de 
informações contábeis trimestrais entre 2009 e 2011 – indicam que existem elevados custos de 
mudança no mercado de depósitos bancários, e que estes custos tendem  a ser menores para  os 
consumidores  de  bancos  maiores.  Adicionalmente,  foi  encontrada  evidência  que  uma  grande 
parte  da  participação  de  mercado  de  um  banco  se  deve  às  suas  relações  continuadas  com  os 
consumidores  ao  longo  do  tempo.  Portanto,  a  competição  potencial  no  mercado  brasileiro  de 
depósitos bancários pode ser fortemente reduzida por estes custos.

Introduction 

1. 

 

Even though there are anecdotal and incomplete evidence switching costs are important in 
the  Brazilian  banking  sector,  academic  studies  regarding  the  relevance  of  switching  costs  are 
scarce. The present paper aims to fill this gap, by measuring the switching costs in the Brazilian 
bank deposits’ market.  

There  are  some  striking  examples  of  the  high  value  of  the  acquisition  of  a  customer  in 
Brazil.  The  first  one  is  the  existence  of  the  so-called  “university  accounts”,  which  reduce  the 
customer’s  bank  fees  throughout  his  or  hers  college  education.  Another  example  is  the 
aggressiveness of banks in bidding for the right to manage public institutions’ payroll services, 
and  a  third  one  is  the  requirement,  valid  until  a  short  time  ago,  for  employees  to  receive  their 
salary in a bank account defined by the employer.  

All  these  examples  point  to  a  market  in  which  customers  face  a  high  cost  to  switch 
suppliers. These costs increase incentives to capture customers, may confer market power to the 
incumbent companies and act as a barrier to potential entrants, with important consequences for 
the competitiveness of the banking sector. 

These  high  switching  costs  may  also  explain  to  some  extent  the  difficulty  for  new 
suppliers to gain market share. An example is HSBC, which even being a major global player, 
has  a  lower  market  share  in  Brazil.  Despite  being  in  Brazil  since  1997  and  have  reached  the 
sixth position among the largest banks, HSBC total assets (BRL 146.6 billion) are only 34.0% of 
the ones of the next one in the ranking (Santander, with BRL 431.8 billion)3. The other banks in 
this  ranking  are  either  the  institutions  already  large  in  the  past  or  those  that  became  so  by 
acquiring of other large institutions – such as HSBC. 

The  model  used  to  estimate  the  switching  costs,  developed  by  Kim,  Kliger  and  Vale 
(2003), besides not requiring microdata on individual customers’ behavior, also makes possible 
to  estimate  some  implications  for  the  competitive  structure  of  the  market.  These  implications 
shed some light on the market power to the largest players derived from the switching costs. 

In  order  to  do  so,  this  paper  is  divided  in  five  sections,  including  this  introduction.  The 
section two presents the methodology for estimating switching costs. The session three presents 
the  dataset  and  the  baseline  specification,  followed  by  the  discussion  of  the  results  in  section 
four. And finally, the session five concludes.

Methodology 

The  methodology  used  in  this  work  follows  the  framework  developed  by  Kim,  Kliger 
and Vale (2003). They apply the model to the market of bank loans model, and here the focus 
will be on the provision of bank deposit services. 

The model is formulated to allow estimation of the structural parameters using aggregate 
data.  It  is  based  on  the  theoretical  analysis  of  the  effect  of  customer's  switching  costs  in  the 
market  developed  in  Klemperer  (1987a),  with  the  additional  assumption  the  customer  can 
change banks at every time period.

the 50 largest banks).

The  model  considers  an  n  firm  oligopoly  with  price  competition  (Bertrand),  with  non-
storable  goods.  Consumers  have  inelastic  total  demand  and  maximize  their  utilities  deciding 
from  which  firm  to  buy,  given  the  charged  prices.  It  is  assumed  that,  when  comparing  prices, 
consumers have in mind that the transfer between firms costly only to the extent of an additional 
cost  on  top  of  prevailing  prices.  This  additional  cost  subsumes  all  implicit  costs  of  changing 
suppliers. 

The customer's behavior described in  the model produces transition  probabilities which 
are  functions  of  prices  and  switching  costs.  The  aggregation  of  these  transition  probabilities 
generates the demand faced by the firm.  

The probability to continue purchasing from the same firm is defined as 

 

 

 

 

 

(1)  

in  which 

 is  the probability that a customer who  bought  in  the previous period  from  firm  i 

keep buying from the same firm in the next period. 

 is the price charged by firm i. 

 is an 

 vector of prices offered by rivals other than i. And 

 is a vector of switching costs, equal 

. Thus, the equation (1) means that 
to the scalar “s” multiplied by a unit vector 
the  probability  the  consumer  continues  his  relationship  with  the  bank  depends  on  the  price  all 
banks, taking the switching cost into account.  

: 

Since the switching costs are probably different  for each client, "s" is interpreted as the 
average switching cost. Customer specific deviations from this mean  are captured by the slope 
of the transition probability function, while the firm specific changes in average cost of a bank 
are captured by the level of the function. 

The conditional probability of changing the rival firm j to firm i is given by 

,   

 

 

 

(2) 

where 

 is  the probability that a customer who bought in  the previous period 

 of firm  j 

purchases from firm i in the subsequent period. The intuition for this equation is very similar to 
the previous one. 

Since  the  transitions  are  not  known  with  aggregate  data,  the  probability  of  passing  the 

purchase of firm I, not conditional on the identity of the rival, is given by  

,  

 

 

(3) 

where 

 is the probability that a customer of a rival go to buy the firm i.  The product of firm j 

in t-1 is 

. So 

 is the probability that a customer of a randomly selected rival is 

one who bought from firm j in the previous period. 

The total demand of firm  i in period t,     , depends on its own product in the previous 
period,  the  products  of  rivals  in  the  previous  period  and  the  transition  probabilities,  which  are 
the basis of current prices and costs: 

       (                               )

To obtaining the demand as a function of companies’ market shares, a linear first order 

approximation in the transition probabilities has been applied. 

From this linearization, the aggregation of transition probabilities results in the demand 

faced by firms, which determines the market share     of each firm 4:

In  the  supply  side,  it  is  assumed  that  the  firm  acts  to  maximize  the  present  value  of 

profits. For any moment,

where 

 is  the discount factor for one period, 

 the firm's period t profits  and 

 is the cost function, which specifies the technology of the firm. 

Solving  the  maximization  problem,  the  price-cost  margin  equation  for  period  t  is 

obtained: 

 ,

where 

 and

Some important results from the model developed are below. From equation (5) market 

share, we have 

a) 

Lock-in effect - the impact of t-1 market share on the firm's current market share 

is positive:

b) 

The impact of the existing market share (period t-1) in the current market share is 

increasing as the switching cost increases: 

  

c) 

Switching  costs  effect:  the  switching  costs’  impact  in  market  share  is  dubious: 

  

   are firm-specific intercepts, which capture the heterogeneity of the firm. The    coefficient

measures the sensitivity of the probability of transition to the price charged by the firm itself and    is 
the cross-price sensitivity. 
5 This assumption can be easily relaxed, as done in Alencar et al. (2005), to test it directly on estimation.

The switching costs operate in favor of firms which are greater than average and against 
firms lower than average. Thus, the existence of switching costs results in larger market shares 
for firms larger than the average. 

From equation (7), cost marginal price, one has:

d) 

The first term on the right side of the equation represents the benefit to the firm to 
capture  customers  in  period  t,  which  will  be  locked  in  future  periods.  The  higher  this  benefit 
(higher s or 

), the lower the price-cost marginal optimal in period t to capture customers. 

e) 

The second term of the equation represents the power of oligopoly in the current 

period of the firm. The larger the market share, the greater the net price – the marginal cost.

Data and model specification 
Data 

Two databases  have been used in  the analysis. The  main  data source for  the  paper is  the 
accounting information of financial institutions operating in Brazil, obtained from Central Bank 
of  Brazil  (in  Portuguese,  Banco  Central  do  Brazil  or  BCB).  The  database  contains  accounting 
information for financial institutions, broken down by Brazilian Tax ID Number (Report 4010), 
between  2009  and  2011  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Additional  information  was  obtained  from  the 
Central Bank, also on a quarterly basis, by Brazilian Tax ID Number, with respect to the number 
actives  and  non-actives  accounts  and  the  number  of  dependencies.  From  this  dataset,  only 
commercial  or  multiple  banks  with  commercial  activities  with  more  than  20  or  more  accounts 
and more than one branch were kept.  

Thus, the final  sample  contains 57 institutions, 46 multiple banks and nine commercial 

banks, together with public owned Bank of Brasil and Caixa Economica Federal.  

The next issue on the construction of the variables was the definition of deposit services, 
with implications on how to derive the correct price of service measure. To define the price of 
banking  deposit  price,  we  followed  Nakane,  Alencar  and  Kanczuk  (2005),  which  set  the  price 
(p_serv) as the ratio of revenues from services and the balance of bank deposits.  

This  definition  of  price  is  quite  broad,  encompassing  income  from  fund  management, 
investment  brokerage  income  rates,  technical  advice  rents,  lace  package  of  services  for 
individuals,  among  others.  In  this  database,  the  average  revenue  from  services  is  BRL  215.00 
million, with an average price is BRL 0.0085 for each deposited dollar.    

An  alternative  is  to  consider  only  the  income  from  maintaining  the  account  and  the 

transaction charges, since they are directly related to the usage of the current account. 

For this, the variable renda_cc was defined considering just some of the items of income 
from services. The items considered were earned income from services provided to individuals 
and  priority  services  to  businesses  (Registration  costs,  account  statement  providing,  transfers, 
credit card, among others) and the revenues from registration, deposit accounts, transfer funds, 
loans and other banking fee incomes. 

In considering this narrower concept of income, the price (p_cc) was defined as the ratio 
of  revenues  with  tariffs  strictly  related  to  current  account  balance.  The  average  price  is  BRL 
0.0368 for each BRL in sight deposit account. 

As a  comparison,  the variable renda_cc is  about 30% of  renda_servicos. Since there is 
uncertainty on which of the two concepts would be more appropriate, estimates were provided 
under both alternatives7. 

                                                           
7 To work with the information on a quarterly basis was necessary to adjust the revenue and expenditure 
information. According to Brasil Central Bank methodology, the accounting data relating to revenue and

It  is  important  to  notice  that,  especially  in  the  narrower  concept,  only  the  direct  and 
transactional fees are considered. Since the opportunity cost of resources held in the account is 
not  considered,  this  measure  understates  the  effective  economic  cost  of  keeping  the  account 
open.  However,  since  data  on  the  investment  alternatives  is  not  available,  this  was  the  only 
possibility. 

Another variable for which there might be disagreement is the number of bank accounts. 
The empirical analysis was carried out using the total number of accounts (cc), whose average is 
2.4  million  accounts  in  the  database,  and  the  number  of  active  accounts  (cca),  averaging  1.5 
million accounts. Exercises were also carried out considering both alternatives. 

In the period 2009-2011, it is observed that there is a high variability in bank sizes and 
most of them are relatively small. In the sample, 50% of banks have nine or fewer dependencies 
and  less  than  1881  active  accounts  on  their  balance  sheets.  Considering  the  market  share, 
measured  by  deposits  value,  note  also  that  50%  of  banks  have  up  to  0,147%  of  market  share, 
according to the table below.

From these values, only 5% of banks have more than 3375 branches and more than 14.7 
million active accounts. However, each of these banks holds 16.41% or more market share, an 
indication that few banks concentrate most of the banking market. 

Between 2009 and 2011, the country's biggest banks are Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, Itaú, 
CEF, HSBC and Santander. From the point of view of assets, in 2009 Banco do Brasil was the 
largest, while in 2010 this position has to be occupied by Itaú and in 2011 returned to Banco do 
Brasil. 

                                                                                                                                                                                          
expenditure of June and December record the accumulated between January and June and between July and 
December, respectively. I.e., the values reported in June and December refers to biannual. However, once in March 
and September data correspond to balances accumulated between January and March and between July and 
September, respectively, it was possible to obtain information relating to the second and fourth quarter, subtracting 
from June the March information and from December the September information. Reference:

If the  number of total  accounts (or active accounts)  is  used for ranking the institutions, 
the  ordering  may  change,  but  not  by  much.  In  2009,  the  three  criteria  indicate  the  Banco  do 
Brasil  as  the  largest  bank;  in  2010,  while  Itaú  has  the  largest  asset  base,  the  Banco  do  Brasil 
remains the institution with the largest number of accounts, regardless of criterion used. In 2011, 
Bradesco has the largest number of active accounts, while the total number of accounts and the 
number of assets is still higher in the BB. 

The  second  place  is  disputed  by  Bradesco  and  Itaú,  depending  on  the  year  and  the 

criteria used. HSBC ranks sixth in the ranking of banks, whatever the criterion.

The  market  shares  of  banks  show  a  quite  stable  pattern  over  time.  The  correlation 
between current market share and market share lagged by one quarter is 0.9969, 0.9960 in two 
quarters,  three  quarters  0.9952,  0.9948  in  four  quarters,  five  quarters  0.9944  and  six  quarters 
0.9929. 

Such  a  pattern  may  be  an  indication  that  there  is  little  change  of  customers  from  one 
bank to another in a quarter or even a year. However, as noted by Kim, Kliger and Vale (2003), 
"strictly speaking, a high correlation between intertemporal market shares can also results from 
intensive switching between banks, resulting in (near) zero change in net market share" (p. 42). 
The  model  to  be  estimated  has  the  aim  to  unveil  the  actual  changes  hide  in  the  evolution  of 
market share. 

 

3.2.  Model Specification 

The  starting  point  for  the  econometric  analysis  is  the  system  of  equations  formed  by 

equations (5) and (7), presented here again for the sake of convenience: 

8 

   

  

 

 

 

 

(5) 

(7) 

Kim,  Kliger  and  Vale  (2003)  estimated  these  equations  simultaneously  using  nonlinear 

3SLS8. In this system the variables

, 

, time differences of prices, time differences of 

deposits  and  market  shares  are  to  be  endogenous.  The  instruments  used  were  the  lags  of  the 
deposits, of the number of branches and of market shares. 

As noted in the model presentation, the coefficient   indicates the magnitude of switching 
coefficient, as demand 

costs. Another check on the adequacy of the estimates is the sign of the
is expected to be negatively related to prices. 

In  the  original  model  estimated  by  Kim,  Kliger  and  Vale  (2003),  the  variable  pmc  is 
defined  as  the  difference  between  price  and  marginal  cost.  In  this  paper,  it  is  assumed  the 
marginal cost of a bank in the provision of services is 20.03% of the price of the service9, in a 
similar  way  to  Alencar  et  al.  (2005),  who  apply  this  assumption  to  the  marginal  cost  of 
borrowing. 

The  20.03%  figure  was  computed  from  two  studies:  Fundação  Instituto  de  Pesquisas 

Contábeis,  Atuariais  e  Financeiras  (FIPECAFI)  (2004)  and  Nakane,  Alencar  and  Kanczuk 

(2005). The  results suggest  that 33% of interest  income on loans is used  to  pay  administrative 

costs. However, as 38.89% of the administrative costs would be related to the funding activity, 

20.03% of the income from lending activities would be used to cover administrative costs. The 

same proportion is assumed to hold for the provision of deposits. 

Equation (7), after the incorporation of marginal cost, is defined by

9 Initially, we have tested several specifications for the cost function in order to obtain the necessary parameters for 
estimating the  marginal cost  of banks. However, it  was not possible to obtain reasonable results,  which fulfill the 
desired purpose, since the estimation led to marginal costs predicted much higher prices found for the vast majority 
of banks in the sample, which does not seem reasonable.

Equations (8) and (9) were jointly estimated by nonlinear generalized method of moments 
(GMM)10. The variables relating to prices, market share and product are endogenous and  were 
instrumented with two to four lags of deposits, of the number of branches (agencies) and of the 
market share.

Results 

An important issue to be addressed during the estimation is the product dimension of the 
market, with the implication of which banks should be in the sample. As observed Kim, Kliger 
and  Vale  (2003),  "if  the  size  of  the  branch  network  affects  the  state  and  the  degree  of 
competition, for example, due to location preferences, then banks that have a very small number 
of agencies cannot be a good matching in a model that has the chance to mutual competition" 
(p. 43). 

A first filter was applied to limit the sample to banks that are potential competitors in the 
retail  banking  market,  offering  current  account  and  related  services.  Investment  banks, 
“multiple”  banks  with  no  retail  services,  credit  unions,  development  banks  that  are  not  part  of 
conglomerate  and  conglomerates  and  independent  institution  non-bank  were  dropped  from  the 
sample at this time. 

The same criterion was used to drop from the sample banks with less than 20 accounts on 
their  balance  sheets  (active  or  not),  as  well  as  those  that  do  not  reach,  throughout  the  sample 
period, more than one branch. 

Despite all these filters applied on the raw data, the final sample still presents banks with 
very  different  sizes.  Given  this,  the  strategy  suggested  by  Kim,  Klieger  and  Vale  (2003), 
estimating  the  system  of  equations  with  several  subsamples,  defined  by  different  minimum 
numbers of branches in order to compare the estimated costs11.  

The first set of estimates (estimation 1) considers the broader definition of services whose 
charges  are  defined  by  the  variable  renda_servicos,  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  and  the 
price by the ratio between these rates and total deposits (p_serv). For the second set of estimates 
(estimation 2) the definition of fees is restricted to include only those strictly related to current 
accounts  (renda_cc),  whose  revenues  were  expressed  as  a  share  of  demand  deposits.  The 
estimated coefficients are shown in the following table. 

                                                           
10 The  estimations  were  performed  using  the  econometric  software  STATA  /  MP  11.2.  We  used  the  function 
Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation, with the weighting matrix of the moment conditions robust to 
heteroskedasticity arbitrarily defined (wmatrix robust option) and initial parameter values  equal to -0.5 for 
 and 

.  The  estimates  were  not  sensitive  to  the  initial  values  and,  in  general,  showed  convergence  after  a 

0.5  for
maximum number of six iterations for the first stage and four iterations for the second stage. 
 
11 The authors also suggest running the estimates according to loan sizes, as a way to measure the capacity of the 
bank to provide all banking services. Since the focus of the present paper is on deposit services, this test was not 
carried out.

*  The table presentes the estimated parameters and heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors from the joint 
esimation of the system of equations composed of equations (21) and (22), for a balanced quarterly panel from 
2009/1 to 2011/4. All coefficients are significant at 1%.  
The column marked 1st is carried out with the full sample, the column marked 10 is the one using banks wih ten or 
more branches, and so forth.  

First  of  all,  it  is  important  to  notice  that  the   coefficient  is  in  the  range  that  implies 
transition  probabilities  between  [0,1]  in  all  estimations,  so  additional  restrictions  are  not 
required. 

In  all  estimates  -  for  different  concepts  and  subsamples  -  the  parameter  obtained  for  the 
average cost of changing providers   is positive and significant, which indicates the existence of 
switching costs in the Brazilian service banking market. Likewise, α1 (gradient of the transition 
probability  function)  is  also  statistically  significant  for  all  models.  The  negative  sign  for  α1  is 
also in line with expectations. 

Besides  positive  and  significant  for  the  Brazilian  banking  market,  the  estimated    
coefficient  indicates  that  the  switching  costs  are  high.  The  interpretation  of  the  estimated 
coefficient suggests that switching costs account for 40% of deposits in estimation  (1) with the 
full sample. 

Since the average deposit  by current  account is close to  BRL 11,400 for the full sample, 
the  estimated  coefficient  indicates  a  cost  of  change  would  be,  in  average,  BRL  4,574  per 
account. 

A  possible  criticism  of  this  estimate  would  be  this  is  a  result  of  the  implied  market 
definition, since the variables used are related to a broad definition of deposits, considering not 
only sight deposits, but also savings accounts, interbank accounts, among others. 

Thus, another exercise was carried out in which the fees definition was restricted to those 
strictly  related  to  sight  deposit  accounts  (renda_cc).  The  estimated  parameters  implied  an 
average  switching  cost  for  the  full  sample  being  74%  of  the  amount  in  the  sight  deposit 
accounts. For an average deposit  of  BRL  1,123 per account,  this implies an  average switching 
cost of BRL 832 for each sight deposit account.  

As in Kim, Kliger and Vale (2003), the switching cost decreases as we consider the largest 
banks only, but remained significant for all considered samples. Switching costs reach 30.2% of 
deposits in the estimation 1 and 26.2% of sight deposits in estimation 2.  

1111 

 

According  to  these  authors,  this  result  of  lower  switching  costs  for  larger  banks  may  be 
related to the fact that "banks with a larger network most often serve a greater portion of larger 
and more mobile clients (wholesalers) than smaller retail clients" (p. 44). 

This,  however,  does  not  seem  to  be  a  plausible  explanation  for  the  market  in  question, 
since, for the sample used, smaller banks have, on average, customers with higher deposits per 
account. 

One possible explanation for the results found in this work lies in evidence that customers 
of small banks have longer relationships than customers of big banks. This can be linked to the 
fact  that  large  Brazilian  banks  are  essentially  retail  banks,  while  smaller  banks  are  generally 
more  specialized.  The  service’s  specificity  can  lead  to  greater  importance  of  maintaining  the 
relationship between the customer and the bank, justifying thus the higher cost of change found. 

An  important  conclusion  is  the  estimated  coefficients  are  similar  regardless  of  the 
definition  of  services  considered:  either  total  or  sight  deposits.  The  decrease  in  the  switching 
cost for larger banks is also observed in both sets of estimates. 

The  most  significant  differences  between  estimates  were  observed  (i)  in  the  estimated 
coefficient for the  whole  sample, which was significantly higher in  the second estimation, and 
(ii) the estimated coefficient from the sample containing only the largest banks, which was lower 
in estimation 2. 

4.1. Additional Implications of Switching Costs 

The  estimated  parameters  from  the  model  developed  by  Kim,  Kliger  and  Vale  (2003), 
reported  in  section  8.2,  can  be  used  to  compute  quantitative  information  on  various 
characteristics of the relationship between customer and the bank.  The next table provides short 
descriptions  of  the  characteristics  to  be  explored,  with  information  on  how  to  compute  these 
values from the estimates.

The estimates above suggest that for a medium bank, the average probability of a customer 
to continue using the services from one quarter to the next is between 91.0% and 93%. In sight 
deposits, such probability goes from 83% to 92%. 

   The  average  probability  a  customer  that  use  the  services  of  rivals  migrate  to  a  specific 
bank varies between 1.8% and 2.8%, averaging 2.4% in the estimation 1, and 2.9% to 7.7% in 
estimation 2. Note that such probabilities increase for samples with the largest banks, while the 
probability of getting on the same bank decreases. 

Once  the  estimates  made  are  based  on  a  quarterly  period  annual  defection  rate  is  given 

 

by         (       )
.  Thus,  on  average,  31.4%  of  customers  change  banks  every  year  in  the 
estimation 1 and 44.3% in estimation 2. The time required for   percent of customers to switch 
can be defined as                          . For k = 99%,   changes from 12.2 to 15.3 years, 
with  an  average  of  12.2  years  for  the  estimation  1.  As  for  the  second  estimation,  the  results 
suggest that the average length of relationship between bank and customers would be around 8.5 
years on average, and the minimum value was 6.2 years and a maximum of 14.3 years. 

This result is in line with the estimates for other countries, in terms of the average length 
of  relationship  between  customer  and  bank.  Kim,  Kliger  and  Vale  (2003)  found  that  the  time-
client relationship bank in Norway is between 11.3 and 16.7 years if markets are defined by the 

13 

 
size of the branch network, or between 7.5 and 19.4 years if markets are defined according to the 
size of loans12.  

For Brazil, the results found by Alencar et al. (2005) suggest that the average bank-client 
relationship would be 5.03 years, below the results found in this study, but that was considered 
low by the authors themselves. Other features of the bank's relationship  with the customer can 
be deduced from the estimated model. 

From market share equation (5), the contribution of market share in the previous period to 

the current period (lock-in effect) is given by 

13. According to the 

obtained results, the lock-in effect for the market for banking services in Brazil is 0.892 for the 
full sample of total deposits in the market. In other words, 89.2% of the market share in a given 
quarter is due to the relationship between the banks and their clients in the previous quarter. The 
average for this estimation is 89.6% and for the estimation 2 is 81.0%. 

Another  important  result  that  can  be  derived  from  the  model  is  the  ratio  of  the  marginal 
value of customer captured (locked-in) to the growth of the present value of the bank. Estimates 
suggest  that  the  value  of  this  ratio  is,  on  average,  0.812  for  the  total  market  deposits.  Thus, 
81.2%  of  value  added  by  the  client  is  derived  from  the  lock-in  phenomenon  generated  by 
switching costs. For sight deposits, the value found was 73.4% on average. 

With the proposed approach, it is also possible to observe that the effect of switching costs 
impact in market shares is ambiguous and favor firms that are larger than average, against firms 
smaller than the average: 

 

As  an  example,  the  impact  of  switching  costs  for  banks  with  higher  and  lower  market 
shares was estimated. In September 2011, the largest volume of services income  was observed 
for Itaú Unibanco (21.6%), while the lowest was of the La Nacion Argentina Bank (0.00011%). 
Considering the estimated coefficients, the impact of switching costs on market share is negative 
for La Nacion Argentina bank, corresponding to about -0.04. On the other hand, the contribution 
of the switching costs for the market share of Itaú Unibanco is estimated at +0.44. In this sense, 
switching costs tend to act toward greater banking concentration. 

5. 

Conclusions 

Several  examples  suggest  switching  costs  may  be  relevant  for  the  Brazilian  banking 
sector.  The  existence  of  college  accounts,  the  aggressiveness  of  banks  bidding  for  the  right  to 
manage the payroll of  public servants  and the requirement,  the requirement,  valid  until a short 
time ago, for the salary to be paid to  a bank account defined by the employer are just some of 
them. 

Despite  anecdotal  and  incomplete  evidence  that  the  Brazilian  banking  sector  has 
significant  switching  costs,  presented  above,  studies  regarding  its  magnitude  and  implications 
for the competitive structure are still scarce. 

                                                           
12 Kim, Kliger e Vale (2003) note that these estimates are in line with findings for other countries, citing that in Italy

years, 7.8 years in Belgium.

In this context, the present study aimed to estimate the costs of switching suppliers in the 
bank  deposit  market  in  Brazil,  using  the  methodological  alternative  developed  by  Kim,  Kliger 
and  Vale  (2003).  The  methodology  allows  us  to  test  the  existence  of  switching  costs  without 
requiring the use consumer data, which are rarely available. 

The database used contains financial information, on a quarterly basis, between 2009 and 
2011  about  commercial  banks,  “multiple”  banks  with  commercial  portfolio,  as  well  as  public 
banks with commercial banking activities (Banco do Brasil and Caixa Economica Federal), with 
more than 20 accounts.  

In  general,  the  results  showed  the  cost  of  change  is  significant  for  the  market  of  deposit 
services  of  the  Brazilian  banking  sector.  Estimates  suggest  that  customers  with  sight  deposits 
have  an  average  cost  of  around  BRL  471.17  per  account  to  change  the  bank.  Switching  costs 
appear to be inversely proportional to the average size of the banks, indicating that customers of 
larger  banks  have  lower  switching  costs.  One  explanation  for  this  evidence  is  the  fact  that 
customers of smaller banks attribute more value to preserve the relationship with the institution, 
which may be associated with greater specialization of the smaller banks, in general specialized 
wholesale banks. 

As for features derived from switching costs, it was estimated that the average duration of 
the  customer  relationship  with  the  bank  is  8.4  years  in  Brazil,  with  evidence  that  for  smaller 
banks this length is even greater. 

The estimates also indicate that 81.0% of market share in a given time period is due to the 
relationship between the bank and the client in the previous quarter (lock-in effect) and 73.4% of 
value  added  by  the  client  is  derived  from  the  lock-in  generated  by  switching  costs,  a  further 
evidence  that  the  switching  costs  are  relevant  for  the  Brazilian  banking  market.  Even 
considering  that  the  switching  costs  are  lower  for  holders  of  larger  banks,  they  are  still  high 
enough  to  restrict  potential  competition  between  banks  -  either  latecomers  in  national  scale  or 
latecomers in geographically limited scale. 

Finally, it is noteworthy that the switching costs work in favor of firms which are greater 
than average and against firm smaller than average. Switching costs tend to act toward greater 
banking concentration and an unexpected effect of the recent wave of subnational governments 
to auction their payrolls is reduced competition. It is possible that part of the funds paid by the 
banks for acquiring the payroll services have been raised by higher mark-ups – with the already 
known negative effects in economic efficiency.
