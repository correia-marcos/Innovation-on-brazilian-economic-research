Abstract:  The  national  Law  of  Guidelines  and  Standards  of  Education  of  1996  stablished  2007  as  the 
deadline  for  all  Brazilian  basic  education  teachers  to  have  tertiary  education  level  habilitation.  This 
implied a significant change in the profile of teachers in basic education, the change in the provision of 
pre-service training, and it was expected to improve teaching quality and students’ achievement in Brazil. 
The  objective  of  this  study  is  to  investigate  the  effects  of  the  increase  in  the  share  of  public  upper 
secondary  school  teachers  with  higher  education  on  students’  performance  in  math  and  Portuguese  and 
analyze the role of pre-service training framework on the quality of teachers in recent  years.  We carried 
out an empirical analysis in which we estimate the Average Treatment Effect on Treated on public upper 
secondary  students  through  the  combination  of  difference-in-difference  and  propensity  score  matching 
method.  We  found  no  evidence  of  positive  effects  on  Portuguese  scores,  and  despite  the  statistically 
significant positive effect of the rise in teachers with higher education on math scores, we find no effect 
from  specific math training.  Finally, we discussed the possible reason  for the ineffectiveness  of teacher 
pre-service training, such as the quality of the training delivered by distance learning modalities and the 
low performance of secondary students that enter in the teacher schools.

1. Introduction 

In  the  last  two  decades  there  has  been  a  significant  change  in  the  profile  of  teachers  in  basic 
education,  resulted  from  tertiary  education  requirement  for  teaching  established  by  the  national  Law  of 
Guidelines and Standards of Education of 1996 (Law No. 9394/96, LDB). This law defined the year 2007 
as deadline for all Brazilian basic education teachers to have tertiary education level habilitation.1  

School  census  data  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MEC)  suggest  that,  although  this  goal  has  not 
been fully achieved, this law appears to have influenced profoundly pre-service teachers’ education. From 
1995 to 2007, the percentage of teachers of basic education with higher education increased from 49% to 
68%,  then  reached  83%  in  2015.  For  upper  secondary  school  teachers,  this  percentage  increased  from 
82% to 93% in the period between 1995 and 2007, remaining stable until 2015.  

At the same time, there was a significant increase in coverage of upper secondary education of 5.4 
to 8.1 million students from 1995 to 2015, which was achieved in detriment of improvements in quality. 
National  Assessment  of  Basic  Education  (SAEB)  results  show  a  drop  in  the  percentage  of  graduates  of 
basic education with adequate levels of learning in mathematics, from 11.6% to 7.3% of students, and in 
Portuguese,  from  45.4%  to  27.5%  of  students  from  1995  to  2015.  It  is  possible  that  the  massive 
incorporation  into  educational  system  of  out  of  school’s  children  from  lower  background  families  have 
negatively influenced the quality of elementary education at first and of secondary education years later. 
This  seems  consistent  with  the  trajectory  of  the  Portuguese  learning  indicator,  which  fell  sharply  up  to 
2005, showed a slight improvement until 2011 and stagnation afterwards, but do not seem to have had the 
same influence on math learning indicator. Thus, it is not clear whether the variation in enrollments was 
able to counterbalance the positive effects expected from the improvement in teachers' schooling.

The literature has established the central role of teachers on students learning, but there is still no 
consensus  on  how  teachers’  pre-service  training  affects  teacher  performance.  Studies  that  measure  the 
value-added  of  teachers  in  a  school  year  find  that  students  with  a  good  teacher  can  achieve  an  average 
gain  of  one  year,  and  students  with  great  teachers  might  gain  1.5  grade  levels  (Hanushek  and  Rivkin 
2010).  In  addition,  teachers  critically  impact  not  only  children’s  immediate  learning  progress,  but  also 
their longer-term development and life choices (Bruns and Luque, 2015). However, studies based on the 
educational  production  function  estimates  from  cross-sectional  data  and  on  regression  analysis  of 
aggregated levels of student performance  fail to find statistically significant effects of teacher education 
measures  (Hanusheck,  2003).  Other  series  of  studies  developed  since  2000s,  based  on  student-level 
longitudinal  data  and  involving  broader  sets  of  variables,  and  more  recent  researches  that  address  non-
observed heterogeneity and selection bias problems, find positive effects for some disciplines and grades 
and specific types of teacher pre-service education (Wayne and Youngs, 2003; Harris and Sass, 2011).

teaching in early childhood education and in the first years of elementary school.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of the increase in the share of public upper 
secondary school teachers with higher education on students learning in math and Portuguese and analyze 
the role of pre-service training framework on the quality of teachers in recent years. To this end, we first 
present  the  recent  changes  on  teachers’  pre-service  training  in  Brazil  and  an  overview  of  the  empirical 
literature  on  the  subject.  Subsequently  we  carry  out  an  empirical  analysis  in  which  we  estimate  the 
Average Treatment Effect on public upper secondary students and conclude with a discussion on how the 
current policies affect the quality of teachers in Brazil. 

 

2. Key issues on teachers pre-service training in Brazil 

Since the publishing of the LDB in 1996, whose article 62 defined the minimum requirements for 
teaching  in  basic  education,  a  new  regulation  on  pre-service  training  began  to  be  stablished.  Initially, 
LDB  determined  that  basic  education  teachers  should  be  trained  at  the  tertiary  level,  in  licenciatura 
courses. The exception was a specific upper secondary level training, called Normal course, for teaching 
exclusively  in  early  childhood  and  early  grades  of  primary  education.  In  1999,  the  decree  No.  3276/99 
established that the training for teaching in specific fields of knowledge, such as math, biology, physics, 
etc., would take place in specific courses (also licenciatura degree) designed specifically for this purpose.  
The  resolution  CNE  No.  02  of  2015,  which  defines  the  National  Curriculum  Guidelines  for 
Teacher  Training,  established  three  pre-service  training  options  that  habilitate  teachers  for  basic 
education: (i) licenciatura degree, with a duration of four academic years and a minimum of 3200 hours 
of  academic  work;  (ii)  second  licenciatura  degree,  for  licenciatura  degree  holders  that  want  to  teach 
another field, with a reduced minimum workload of 1200 hours; and (iii) pedagogical supplementation, 
for  bachelor  degree  holders,  which  require  a  minimum  of  1000  for  the  completion  depending  on  the 
equivalence between graduation already obtained and the field of the intended pedagogical training.2  

There are many questions about the quality of teachers in Brazil related to the framework of pre-
service  training  and  the  governance  of  the  system.  For  example,  what  was  the  effect  of  the  increase  in 
teacher education requirement  on basic education  students' learning?  Is the public education system not 
able to attract top performance secondary schools’ graduates? Do we have a problem of quality in teacher 
training courses? Regarding pre-service training, there are two major vectors  that may  affect the quality 
of  teachers:  the  first  considers  aspects  of  the  educational  background  of  those  interested  in  teaching 
career; the second is regarded to the profile and structure of tertiary education (Bruns and Luque, 2015).3  
The significant increase in coverage of primary and secondary education observed until the mid of 
2000 in Brazil required hiring new teachers, which resulted in a change in the profile of the freshmen in 
this career (Lerch et al, 2010). In response to the rapid increase in demand for teachers with degrees, there 
was a boom in the provision of tertiary education programs. This led to the inclusion in the teacher career 
of secondary education graduates from families of lower socioeconomic background.  

The  percentage  of  public  upper  secondary  education  teachers  with  higher  level  increased  from 
82% to 93% in more than 20 years, mainly due to licenciatura degrees (Figure 2). However, there are still 
teachers without higher education or with pedagogy degree, which is not focused on secondary education, 
whose  share  corresponds  to  7.6%.  Also,  due  to  a  lack  of  minimum  standards  for  teachers’  admission, 
States and municipalities selected teachers with distinct profiles. All these teachers may have been trained 
in different types of institutions that are practically autonomous to decide about their curriculum.  

Louzano et  al.  (2010) investigate the profile and preferences of secondary  school  graduates who 
declared themselves interested in  teaching  career in  2005.4 Only 10% of this group belonged to  the top 
performance students, and about a third were among the bottom performance students. These evidences 
suggest that the teaching career in Brazil is attracting a high share of less-skilled students. In fact, the cut-
off  ENEM  score  required  for  admission  to  public  higher  education  institutions  are  much  lower  for 
licenciatura courses in these universities. In year 2014 the mean cut-off score for licenciatura in specific 

                                                                                       
2 Pedagogical supplementation was instituted in 1997 as a provisional act and originally required a workload of 540 hours. Its 
provisional nature is reversed 2017, and the certification is now recognized in LDB as valid requisite for teaching.  
3 The authors find that Latin America countries are trapped in a low-level equilibrium with low standards for entry into teacher 
training programs, which are not prepared to produce the set of competences found in high performance educational systems.

disciplines  and  in  pedagogy  were,  respectively,  the  5th  and  the  2nd  lowest  in  a  classification  of  75 
courses.5 In addition, licenciatura offered by private institutions are among courses with less competition 
for admission and therefore might be the choice of students with weaker educational background.6

Other  factors  that  may  be  affecting  the  quality  of  trained  teachers  are  related  to  the  nature  and 
quality of teacher pre-service training programs. As pointed out by Bruns et al. (2012) and Carnoy et al. 
(2008), teachers pre-service training, in general, give low relative importance to didactics and techniques 
of teaching and classroom management. In order to shed light on these aspects we explore the changes in 
teacher pre-service training programs in the last ten years.

In the aggregate, the number of graduates in pre-service training courses practically stagnated and 
the bachelor's degree in typical secondary education fields dropped sharply in the period (Table 3). There 
was  a  decrease  in  the  presence  of  potential  teachers  with  a  bachelor  degree  in  favor  of  licenciatura 
degree. Furthermore, there has been a very small growth in the number of graduates from licenciatura in 
math. All licenciatura in specific subjects programs has suffered decrease in the number of graduates in 

                                                                                       
5 Data from the Unified Selection System (SISU) of the Ministry of Education. The most recent data available in a complete 
and systematic way for all public higher education institutions that participated in SISU were from year 2014. 
6  Dada  from  Synopsis  of  Tertiary  Education  Census  -  INEP/MEC  shows  that  the  average  number  of  candidates  per  offered 
place in licenciatura face-to-face courses is 0.68 and in bachelor degree face-to-face courses is 1.45.

the last five years, especially licenciatura in Portuguese.7 The stagnation in number of graduates in math 
and the tendency to extinction of the Bachelor degree may be affecting the quality of math teaching. Note 
that the percentage of bachelor degree teachers with pedagogical supplementation dropped from 11.4% to 
3.3% between 2009 and 2015 (Figure 2).  

Major changes have occurred on the composition of pre-service teaching programs in recent years, 
which may have affected the profile of freshmen in this career. Figure 6 shows that the private institutions 
increased their share on the provision of graduates in pedagogy and in Portuguese, but lost participation 
for graduates in math and practically faced no change for other licenciatura in specific subjects. Federal 
institutions, on the other hand, more than doubled their share in total number of graduates in licenciatura 
in  specific  subjects,  but  lost  participation  in  pedagogy.  Nowadays,  almost  half  of  the  graduates  in 
Portuguese and more than half in math and in other subjects come from public institutions programs.

The most remarkable change in the period was the emergence and growth of distance learning. In 
the  year  2015  about  half  of  pedagogy  graduates  and  one  fourth  of  the  graduates  in  specific  subject 
licenciatura attended this modality. Private institutions has been responsible for the highest shares in the 
number of graduates from distance learning courses, remarkably in pedagogy, whose share has been kept 
above  90%  since  2010  (Figure  8).  Despite  this  protagonist,  the  share  of  private  institutions  in  distance 
learning reduced among licenciatura in specific subjects, with exception to Portuguese, in which private

  The  increase  in  pedagogy  and  decrease  in  Normal  superior  course  graduates  is  related  to  a  new  regulation  in  2006,  which 
allowed pedagogy degree holders to teach in early childhood education and initial years of primary education.

institutions  showed  a  small  increase.  On  the  other  hand,  federal  institutions  increased  their  share  in 
distance  learning  in  specific  subjects  programs.  In  particular,  their  participation  in  the  total  number  of 
graduates in math rose from 12.6% to 36.8% in the period, while private institutions reduced their share. 
Among the graduates in Portuguese, the share of federal institutions went from none to 16% in the period. 
To  shed  light  on  the  potential  effects  of  these  recent  changes  on  the  quality  of  future  teachers, 
Tables  4  and  5  present  the  mean  performance  of  graduates  in  ENADE8  exam  and  a  measure  of  value-
added9  from  public  and  private  licenciatura  programs  in  year  2014.  In  general,  ENADE’s  results  show 
that  top  performance  students  are  enrolled  in  face-to-face  federal  university  and  private  non-for-profit 
institutions  programs  and  the  bottom  performance  are  in  state  and  private  for-profit  institutions.  Also, 
federal universities graduates performed better in both training modalities and graduates from private for-
profit  institution  programs  showed  the  lowest  results.  Finally,  besides  the  better  performance  of 
licenciatura graduates in face-to-face programs as a whole, when restricting to distance learning modality 
this difference almost disappears for graduates in math and pedagogy. In particular, in private institutions, 
the performance of the distance learning programs was superior to face-to-face programs.

In  aggregate,  private  institutions  tend  to  add  as  much  value  as  federal  institutions,  and  non-for-
profit institutions are more capable of adding more value in either training modalities. This advantage is 
even higher for face-to-face licenciatura programs in pedagogy and Portuguese. On the other hand, public 
institutions perform better in math programs, but nonprofit private institutions add more value that state 
institutions. Finally, distance learning tends to  add more value only  for licenciatura  in math for  private 
institutions.  Clearly,  higher  average  scores  in  ENADE  achieved  by  federal  institutions  programs  are 
partly due to the better learning background of their incoming students. Therefore, the higher value-added

of private programs may be due to decreasing returns to the educational production function, whereby it 
would be easier to obtain return from individuals with poor average educational background. 

The above findings allow us to point out a set of factors that may explain why the raise in teacher 
tertiary  education  does  not  seem  to  have  affect  students  learning  in  the  last  decade.  Beyond  the  low 
educational  background  of  incoming  students  and  the  raise  in  distance  learning  modality,  the  present 
analysis raises other key aspects. First, the preponderance of teachers with licenciatura and the sharp fall 
in bachelor degree in specific areas of knowledge may not have been benefic to teachers quality. It is well 
documented  that  the  majority  of  licenciatura  programs  assigns  little  importance  in  developing  core 
teaching competencies, like teaching techniques and planning and organizing classroom activities (Bruns 
et  al,  2011).  But  it  is  also  possible  that  they  fail  in  providing  the  necessary  knowledge  on  the  specific 
subjects taught too. Second, lack of effects may lie in the mismatch between the specific subject training 
of the teacher and the discipline he teachers (e.g.: math teachers that have not a licenciatura or bachelor 
degree in math). The data presently available allow us to test this mismatch hypothesis, as described later. 
Finally, the leading role of private institutions and of distance learning modality in the provision 
of pedagogy courses, while not directly affecting the quality of teaching in secondary education, can have 
effects on the quality of elementary and early childhood schools and, therefore, compromise the learning 
ability of students entering high school. This hypothesis will be addressed in an upcoming study. 

 

3. Empirical literature on teacher training and student learning 

The  quality  of  teachers  and  your  effect  on  students'  learning  is  a  central  theme  of  educational 
policy. The international literature indicates that a student with a low quality teacher ends the school year 
dominating at most half of the curriculum planned for this year, while students with an excellent teacher 
advance 50 percent more than expected (Farr, 2010; Hanushek and Rivkin, 2010). Thus, exposure to low-
quality teachers for years running can lead to insurmountable deficits of students' learning. 

Despite  the  recent  evidences  confirming  the  central  role  of  teacher  quality  on  students  learning, 
there's still no consensus on how much schooling and teacher training contribute to a greater and lesser 
degree, to raise the quality of education. The first works on the productivity of teachers were developed 
based on the educational production function estimates from cross-sectional data, and regression analysis 
of aggregated levels of student performance in teacher training measures and several other controls. 

In studies conducted until mid 1990s for the public schools of the United States, Hanushek (2003) 
identifies  170  estimates  of  the  effect  of  teacher  training  measures  on  the  performance  of  students  in 
United States, of which only 14% reported statistically significant results, 9% of which showing positive 
effects.  This  percentage  drops  to  zero  when  limited  the  analysis  to  only  the  studies  considered  by  the 
author  as  high  quality  (with  estimates  based  on  the  "value  added"  by  a  student  of  the  same  State).  The 
author suggests that the difficulty in capturing the effect of teacher education may be in part due to low 
variability of the indicator between American schools. Another compilation, spanning 63 studies applied 
to  developing  countries,  Hanushek  (2003)  reports  that  56%  of  estimates  of  the  effect  of  teacher's 
education school performance were positive and significant. 

Wayne and Youngs (2003) conducted an extensive review of the existing empirical literature until 
the  early  2000s,  when  most  of  the  evaluation  studies  of  the  effects  of  the  education  of  teacher  passes 
using student-level longitudinal data and involve broader sets of variables. Most of the work considered 
indicates  that  secondary  school  students  learn  more  math  when  their  teachers  have  higher  training  in 
mathematics, and no effect in relation to the lower grades and to other areas of knowledge. Moreover, the 
survey  indicated  that  the  quality  of  teacher  education  (measured  by  the  raking  of  the  institution)  has 
positive relationship on the performance of the students.  

Based  in  a  review  of  a  wide  range  of  empirical  studies,  Rice  (2003)  reports  positive  effects  on 
high  school  mathematics  and  science  achievement  of  students  whose  teachers  have  obtained  advanced 
degrees  in  these  subjects,  and  reports  mixed  evidence  regarding  the  impact  of  advanced  degrees  at  the 
elementary level. Also, there is a positive effect on high school mathematics achievement from certified 
teachers  only  when  the  certification  is  in  mathematics.  Finally,  reports  that  the  training  institution 
attended by teacher positive effect on student achievement, particularly at the secondary level, but points 
out that this can be a reflection of the cognitive ability of the teacher.

Harris and Sass (2011) carry out a survey of the researches developed up to 2010, highlighting the 
fragility  of  previous  work  to  control  the  heterogeneity  among  students  only  by  their  characteristics 
observed  (covariates  of  students).  The  authors  cite  evidence  that  students  who  present  greater  learning 
capacity  and  fewer  disciplinary  problems  tend  to  be  allocated  in  classes  with  more  experienced  and 
qualified  teachers,  so  that  the  lack  of  appropriate  controls  for  the  unobservable  characteristics  tends  to 
generate biased estimates of the effects associated with the training of teachers.  

Regarding  the  studies  that  have  addressed  the  problem  of  selection  bias,  Harris  and  Sass  (2011) 
points  out  eight  studies  that  used  fixed  effects  at  the  student  level  to  control  for  the  heterogeneity  not 
observed,  and  five  that  explored  random  assignment  experiments  between  students  and  teachers  or  that 
use natural experiments. None of the studies finds positive and statistically significant effect of the nature 
of higher education on the future teacher performance and the majority finds no relationship between the 
selectivity  of  higher  education  institution  and  teacher  performance.  Finally,  with  the  exception  of  two 
studies  that  have  identified  significant  and  positive  effects  of  master  degree  education  of  teachers  on 
students  math  scores,  all  other  studies  either  indicate  absence  of  statistically  significant  effect  or  even 
negative effect of holding a postgrad degree on math and language students’ performance. 

Since  unobservable  characteristics  of  teachers  (like  their  IQ)  can  influence  your  pre-service 
training and also affect  your future performance in the classroom, Harris and Sass (2011) incorporate in 
their study the teachers grade in the college admission exam as a way of controlling the effect of higher 
education for the pre-college skills, thus avoiding a major source of bias.10 The authors found no robust 
evidence that pre-service teachers training affect the productivity of the future teacher. 

For  Brazil,  Louzano (2010) did  not  find a significant  correlation  between pre-service training of 
teachers and the performance of students. Menezes Filho (2007), on the other hand, reported significant 
impact  of teacher's  education  only  on third  grade  secondary  education students, and  for teachers  with a 
degree in mathematics. The author also reports that teachers with 50 years or more of age positively affect 
students' learning. Such studies, however, do not use methods capable of dealing with various issues, in 
particular with the existing selection bias in the allocation between students, teachers and schools. 
 
4. Data and Descriptive Analysis 

In this study we use data from the National Examination of Secondary School (ENEM) and from 
the School  Census  for the  years 2009  and 2015,  which covers proficiency  indicators  and a broad set  of 
covariates at student and school levels, for potentially all Brazilian schools.11 In total, there were 20,979 
public  secondary  schools  in  ENEM  microdata,  of  which  17,214  appeared  in  the  year  2009,  19,847 
appeared  in  the  year  2015,  and  16,082  occurred  in  both  years.  Following  the  MEC  criteria  for 
disseminating  the  ENEM  results,  schools  with  less  than  10  students  from  the  3rd  grade  participating  in 
the exam were excluded, which resulted in 11,506 schools remaining in the sample. Of these, 151 schools 
with a participation rate above 100% were also excluded, leaving 11,355 schools at the base in both years.  
Based  on  the  School  Census  data,  two  school  level  variables  were  constructed  to  characterize 
teachers’ education for each field or discipline (math and Portuguese): (i) Percentage of classes taught by 
teacher with higher education, and (ii) Percentage of classes taught by teacher with higher education in 
the field. The calculation was restricted to the schools with at least three upper secondary school classes 
for each discipline, so that the indicators reflect at least one class for each series of this teaching stage.12  

Table  6  shows  statistics  for  outcomes  and  teachers  education  variables,  and  relevant  available 
covariates  in  this  sample.  The  average  math  score  dropped  from  475.6  to  450.8  points  in  this  period,  a 
reduction of 0.31 standard deviation from the average obtained in 2009. This decrease came together with 
the  increase  of  the  dispersion  of  results  among  students,  captured  by  the  rise  in  the  standard  deviation. 

                                                                                       
10 Harris and Sass (2011) investigate the effects of the specific areas of higher education of teachers (Education Major, Math 
Education Major, English Education Major, Math Major e English Major) so as to take advantage of the greater variability of 
these variables to try to capture some effect statistically significant on student performance. 
11 ENEM incorporate the  Item Response Theory  for scores calculation in 2009, when a proficiency scale  with an average  of 
500  points  and  standard  deviation  of  100  points  was  defined,  which  allowed  comparing  results  of  different  editions  of  the 
exam. Moreover, since this year students’ performance in ENEM has become the main access route to public university, which 
has significantly enlarged the number participants. The year of 2015 was the last year in which microdata are available. 
12 Resulted in 11,336 and 10,857 schools  with, respectively, at least three high  school  math and  Portuguese classes in  2009, 
and in 11,317 and 11,323 schools with, respectively, at least three high school math and Portuguese classes in 2015.

Portuguese average score, on the other hand, rose from 477.1 to 490.2 points, an increase of 0.15 standard 
deviation from the average obtained in 2009, and there was a reduction in the dispersion of scores.

In the same period, the percentage of classes taught  by teachers with  higher education increased 
by about 2 percentage points for both math and Portuguese. This result was accompanied by the increase 
of 4.6 percentage points in the percentage of math classes taught by teacher with higher education in this 
field, and the decline of almost 2.2 percentage points in the indicator for Portuguese classes. That is, the 
growth of teacher-specific training for the discipline, from an aggregate point of view, does not seem to 
have had a positive relationship with student performance. 

Some  important  changes  occurred  in  the  period  that  may  be  correlated  with  students’  results. 
Regarding  the  educational  offer  conditions,  the  percentage  of  students  attending  evening  classes 
decreased  from  40.2%  to  25.6%,  the  average  duration  of  classes  increased  from  4.4  to  4.8  hours,  the 
average  number  of  students  per  class  decrease  from  34  to  31,  and  schools  infrastructure  indicator 
increased  from  0.193  to  0.305.  In  relation  to  students’  profile,  the  percentage  of  students  who  have 
already worked decreased from 47.3% to 34.7%, the percentage of students with mothers with complete 
secondary  education  rose  from  38.2%  to  46.2%,  and  the  percentage  of  students  with  computer  and 
Internet access at home increased from 41.7% to 56.3%. The other covariates showed minor variation.  

Table  7  presents  the  percentiles  of  the  percentage  of  classes  taught  by  teachers  with  higher 
education  and  with  higher  education  in  the  field  in  years  2009  and  2015.  While  more  than  80%  of  the 
schools  already  had  all  math  and  Portuguese  classes  taught  by  higher-educated  teachers  in  2009,  big 
changes  occurred  in  the  lowest  percentiles.  For  example,  95%  of  the  schools  had  more  than  half  of  its 
math classes taught by teachers with higher education in 2009 and six year later the same proportion of 
schools had more of 66.7% of its math classes taught by teachers with that degree. For higher education 
in the field indicator, more than half of schools already had all Portuguese classes with teachers trained in 
this  discipline  but  the  proportion  of  math  classes  with  teachers  trained  in  math  is  much  far  from  being 
complete.  In  general,  while  the  changes  in  the  percentage  of  classes  taught  by  teachers  with  higher 
education were concentrated to the very lower percentiles of the distribution, for higher education in the 
field indicator the changes spread also  to higher  order percentiles.  So schools  seem  to  be  converging to 
universalization of teachers training at tertiary level, excepting for field training of Portuguese teachers.

More  interesting  would  be  to  see  how  many  schools  increased  the  indicator  and  to  what  degree 
this  happened.  Tables  8  and  9  show  the  transition  of  the  schools  between  percentile  strata  showed  in 
Table 7, based on 2009’s percentile intervals.  The blue cells show  how  many  schools  managed to raise 
the indicators in the period and the red cells show how many schools faced a decrease in indicators.

In  Table  8,  for  example,  note  that  some  schools  that  had  high  percentage  of  classes  taught  by 
teachers  with  higher  education  in  2015  (above  87.5%  for  math  classes  and  above  94%  for  Portuguese 
classes) was in lower strata of the distribution in 2009 (below 87.5% for math classes and below 94% for 
Portuguese  classes):  1,254  of  9,799  schools  and  1,262  of  9,527  schools,  respectively,  considering  the 
indicator for math and Portuguese classes. On the other hand, other schools that had a high percentage of 
classes taught by teachers with higher education in 2009 passed to lower levels of distribution in 2015: 
1,040 from 9,585 schools and 935 from 9,200 schools, respectively for math and Portuguese classes. 

These  transitions  from  lower  strata  to  the  highest  stratum  of  the  distribution  can  be  used  to 
characterize school treatment condition  in  the following sense: schools that  went  from  a lower strata to 
the  greater  stratum  of  the  distribution  are  considered  to  have  being  treated,  since  they  showed 
improvement  in  the  indicator  in  the  period;  and  schools  that  went  from  the  highest  stratum  to  a  lower 
strata of the distribution are considered to have undergone a negative treatment. Due to its large number, 
schools that remained in the highest stratum of the distribution are considered as control group.  

Based on the above strategy we constructed a set of variables that characterize different degrees of 
exposure  to  treatment,  here  understood  as  the  increase  (or  decrease,  for  negative  treatment)  in  the 
percentage of classes taught by teachers with higher education and by teachers with higher education in 
the  field.  We  subdivide  the  exposition  to  treatment  into  three  degrees  (and  four  degrees,  for  the  higher 
education in the field indicator) according to the stratum in which the school was in year 2009: treatment 
group  1  (Treated  1)  is  composed  of  schools  whose  indicator  was  in  the  stratum  immediately  below  the 
highest, treatment  group 2 (Treated 2) is  composed of schools whose indicator was  in the next stratum, 
and so on; so that the greater the order of treatment, the greater its intensity is. Similarly, the degree of 
negative treatment can also be characterized in degrees, according to the stratum of the school in 2015. 

We  see  in  Table  10  that  for  both  years  and  disciplines  the  average  scores  are  higher  among 
students  from  untreated schools, and are smaller for more intensively treated schools. This is  consistent 
with the hypothesis of positive correlated between teachers’ education and students learning. It would be 
also expected a higher increase in outcome among treated schools, especially among the most intensively 
treated  ones.  Data  on  Portuguese  scores  corroborate  with  this  hypothesis,  but  not  for  math,  as  students 
from treated and untreated schools perceived similar reduction in the average scores.

From  the  perspective  of  the  negative  treatment,  it  would  be  expected  that  the  mean  increase 
(decrease)  in  the  outcome  indicator  would  be  smaller  (greater)  among  treated  schools,  the  most 
intensively treated schools performing relatively worse. However, with the exception of the exposition of 
the students of math classes to higher educated teachers, there is no clear pattern indicating adherence to 

 

11 

the hypothesis (Table 11). Average scores in math decreased most for treated students, as expected. Also, 
average  scores  in  Portuguese  increased  least  for  treated  students,  excepting  for  the  most  intensively 
treated  school  (Treated  3),  which  showed  similar  advance  in  scores.  Similar  results  are  found  when 
analyzing  the  treatment  in  terms  of  percentage  of  classes  taught  by  teacher  with  higher  education  in 
Portuguese  (Treated  3  and  4),  which  may  reflect  schools  strategy  of  exchanging  higher  educated  but 
lower performance teachers by newer teachers, who perform better despite the lower schooling.

5. Causal inference strategy  

What effect did the growth in higher education schooling of upper secondary school teachers have 
on  students  learning?  One  way  to  answer  this  question  would  be  to  compare  the  performance  of  the 
students in schools with high percentage of teachers with a degree (treated group) with the performance in 
schools that did not raise this percentage (comparison group). The main  challenge we confront by doing 
this, however, is to address the problem of selection bias that may affect the estimation of this effect. This 
bias occurs when schools with certain characteristics, like the presence of more motivated and intelligent 
students,  which  have  higher  chances  to  achieve  higher  performance,  are  the  most  attractive  ones  for 
teacher  with  higher  education.  This  entails  in  an  overestimation  of  the  treatment  effects  due  to  reverse 
causality.13 Be enrolled in treated schools implies better students performance? Or characteristics related 
to the performance of students imply more treatment schools?  

In this sense, it is necessary to compare the performance of treated schools with a group of schools 
that  have  similar  chances  to  be  treated,  even  if  they  were  not.  We  do  this  by  applying  difference-in-
difference  estimation  on  matched  samples  obtained  by  propensity  score  matching,  which  allows  us  to 
control for several observed and unobserved school characteristics that may contribute to selection bias.  
Adapted from Cameron and Trivedi (2005), in a model of differences-in-differences, considering a school 
panel of two periods, the ATT can be obtained from the  parameter in equation (1): 

 

 

                                    

         

             

 

   (1) 

where: Yist is the achievement of the student i who attended school s in period t, with t = 0 for the pre-
treatment period and t = 1 for the post-treatment period; Ds indicates treatment condition of the school s, 

                                                                                       
13

 It is expected that better schools attract  or select higher performance teachers.  As an example,  Hanushek et al (2004)  find 
that teachers in Texas tend to move to schools with more proficient students, especially the more experienced ones, who often 
have the option of going through districts and choose the school within the district in which they teach. Thus, it is necessary to 
isolate the characteristics of students and schools in order to guarantee that the odds of attracting/retaining teachers with higher 
education  are  similar  for  both  treatment  and  control  schools.  In  this  sense,  the  treatment  status  between  schools  with  same 
characteristics would be random (conditional independence assumption).  

 

12 

with  Ds  =  1  if  the  school  has  been  treated  and  Ds  =  0  otherwise;  Xit  and  Wst    are  vectors  of  covariates 
(students and schools observable characteristics); 0, 1,  , and  are parameters and  and λ  are vectors 
of  parameters  to  be  estimated;  and  ɛist  =  cs  +  uist    where  cs  denotes  the  error  component  related  to  the 
unobservable characteristics that are constant in time of school s; and uist is an error term. 

Note that     is  basically  the  dif-in-dif estimator  computed in  a  regression of stacked students  for 
schools  and  years,  which  implicitly  assumes  constant  treatment  effect  for  schools.  In  order  to  eliminate 
the error in the estimation of ATT from specific characteristics of schools that are constant in the time, the 
parameters  of  the  equation  (1)  are  measured  by  fixed  effects  estimators  with  clustered  standard  errors. 
Besides, as almost all the high public schools in the state are managed by the state government, it is added 
to  the  linear  trend  model  dummy  variables  for  each  state  to  control  for  changes  in  the  state  education 
policies. Considering these policies vary widely among States, the omission of these trends could result in 
a substantial bias in estimating the impact of characteristics of teachers and other school variables.14 

Dif-in-dif  assumes  that  in  the  absence  of  treatment  the  original  difference  between  treated  units 
and comparison schools in the outcome remain constant over time. That is, consider the potential outcome 
  , where the subscript 1 indicates the result under the treatment and 
of a school s in time t like    
the subscript 0 indicates the result in absence of treatment. Thus, this assumption implies that:  

    and    

 

 

 

        

                    

 

        

          

 

                  

          

                   

         . 

                    
                  
 

            

Therefore,  under  the  condition  that         
difference of the difference in outcome in time of treated and non-treated schools, that is: 
 

          the  treatment  effect  could  be  estimated  as  the 

                                          . 

 
The model of equation 1 controls for several characteristics of schools and students and for non-
observed differences between schools by assuming that they are fixed in time. However, as we have only 
one year of pre-treatment data, it is not possible to verify if the difference in outcome between treated and 
comparison  schools  followed  a  constant  trend  over  pre-treatment  time.  Thus,  given  the  substantial  pre-
existent differences between treated and non-treated schools characteristics that may affect the outcomes, 
instead  of  relying  solely  on  this  model,  we  used  a  matching  strategy  to  non-parametrically  control  any 
remaining  differences  between  the  two  groups  in  the  pre-treatment  period  (see  Heckman  et  al.  1997, 
1998). Specifically, we use propensity score matching methods to attribute weights to non-treated schools 
in a way that they mimic the counterfactual of the treated schools.15 

To define a subsample not treated sufficiently similar to the sample treated in terms of covariates 
normally  the  following  protocol  applies  (Becker  and  Ichino,  2002).  First,  get  the  propensity  scores  of 
treatment of treated and untreated units, from estimating of               by a logit or probit model and 
select observations in common support. Then determine weight for each control unit in common support 
based on its proximity to  a treated unit, which  can be done by  alternative methods.16 Then test whether 
the  null  hypothesis  that  the  means  of  control  and  treatment  groups  covariates  are  equal  (balancing 
property). If null hypothesis is not rejected, use the weighted sub-sample in common support to estimate 
the  ATT.  In  the  end,  it  is  expected  that  the  estimated  propensity  scores  densities  are  overlapping,  what 
indicates the two groups of schools in the common support present similar pre-treatment characteristics. 

                                                                                       
14 Another assumption required by dif-in-dif is that the group composition does not change after the intervention, which is  a 
minor concern once we restricted the sample of schools only to those present in both “pre” and “post” treatment years.).   
15

  Rosenbaum  and  Rubin  (1983)  demonstrate  that  the  validity  of  the  above  strategy  depends  on  two  assumptions.  The  first, 
selection  on  observables  assumption,  states  that  the  potential  outcomes  are  independent  of  exposure  to  treatment  when 
          , where    is a vector of variables capable of explaining 
conditioning by a set of observable features, that is,    
the exposure to treatment. The second, common support assumption, states that there are no observations where the researcher 
knows for sure if the unit has been treated or not by observing only the covariates, that is,                      . 
16

  Nearest-neighbor  method  can  imply  that  for  a  treated  unit  the  propensity  scores  reported  by  its  controls  is  too  far  apart, 
which  affect  the  quality  of  the  matching.  Radius  method  circumvents  this  problem  by  imposing  a  condition  of  maximum 
distance between the scores of treated and control units, but if the distance chosen is too small, it is possible that some units not 
find control units. In Kernel method, the closer the score of the control unit is from a treated one, the larger weight is given to 
it.  The  choice  of  the  matching  method  implies  a  trade-off  between  size  and  quality  of  the  matching  sample,  so  the  joint 
application of the methods is recommended in order to assess the robustness of ATT estimates. 

     

 

13 

In summary, to  measure the effects  of teacher education on the performance of schools,  we first 
match the schools based on propensity scores, obtained by estimating a logit model of ex ante probability 
to be treated. Then, we apply, as a benchmark, the method of Radius matching, with maximum distance 
(radius)  of  0.01.  Then,  the  parameters  of  the  equation  (1)  are  measured  by  fixed  effects  estimators  on 
school level. To evaluate the sensitivity of the results to the matching method, the ATT is also estimated 
on  the  matched  sample  by  Kernel  method  (bandwidth  calculated  by  Silverman  rule).  The  procedures 
discussed here will apply to public upper secondary schools, observed at years 2009 and 2015.  

The implementation of this strategy requires that exposure to treatment be characterized by binary 
variables.  We  have  already  defined  them  as  the  three  (or  four)  dummy  variables  constructed  from  the 
percentiles of the teachers’ education indicators in the previous section. Such characterization allows the 
estimation of effects for different degrees of exposure to the treatment, with a sufficiently large number of 
schools in each of the n treated groups and a higher number of schools in the control group. 

 

6. Results 

In  order  to  provide  a  basis  of  comparison  for  the  causal  inference  strategy,  Table  A1  in  the 
Appendix  shows  the  results  of  the  fixed  effects  regressions  of  the  students  scores  on  the  percentage  of 
classes  taught  by  teachers  with  higher  education  and  by  teachers  with  higher  education  in  the  field, 
controlling  by  a  set  of  students  and  schools  characteristics.  The  coefficients  related  to  these  two 
explanatory variables were statistically significant only for Students Portuguese scores.  

Although statistically significant, the magnitude of the coefficients our two explanatory variables 
imply  in  very low effects, when compared to  the magnitude of  other variables that may affect  Students 
scores. For example, if the schools in 5th percentile (as presented in Table 8 of the Descriptive Analysis 
section) increased the Percentages of Classes Taught by Teachers with Higher Education and by Teachers 
with Higher Education in Portuguese to 100% we would expect an increase of only 1.5 and 2.4 points in 
Portuguese scores, respectively, less than 0.03 standard deviations from the year 2009’s mean. 

The estimated coefficients  suggest strong positive  effects on  students’ scores  from  the following 
attributes:  mother’s  education,  presence  of  computer  and  Internet  access  at  home,  and  having  attended 
private  primary  education.  Having  a  car  at  home  (proxy  for  income)  is  positively  correlated  to  math 
scores  but  negatively  correlated  to  Portuguese  scores.  Having  worked  or  being  working  is  negatively 
correlated and having attended evening classes during secondary school is highly negatively correlated to 
students’  math  and  Portuguese  scores.  Students’  access  to  the  Internet  at  home  is  positively  correlated 
with  performance in  the  exam. Also,  a higher proportion of female students  in  school  positively  affects 
Portuguese scores and negatively affects math scores, the duration of classes is positively correlated with 
students’ math  scores  and the  class size  is  negatively  correlated with  Portuguese scores, and  the  school 
infrastructure  indicator  did  not  capture  any  effect.  Finally,  the  addition  the  participation  rate  in  ENEM 
and the number of  secondary school classes does not  affect  the results for  the explanatory variables.  In 
fact,  the  participation  rate  in  the  ENEM  is  negatively  correlated  to  the  Portuguese  scores,  which  may 
indicate the presence of self-selection in the exam, as explained below. 

The use of ENEM scores as output indicator may present a selection bias problem, since student 
enrollment is voluntary and the worst students have less incentive to participate in the exam. Thus, worst 
schools are expected to have lower participation rates in the exam. On the other hand, a low participation 
rate may result from a deliberate action by the school administration to encourage only best students (or 
discourage  worst)  from  attending  the  exam,  which  may  artificially  raise  the  school's  average  grade.  To 
verify the sensitivity of the results in relation to this potential selection bias problem, we re-estimate the 
fixed effects regressions for a restricted sample, which excludes schools whose participation rates in 2009 
were below the median of the distribution.17 After carrying out the estimation, the coefficients for our two 
explanatory  variables  related  to  teachers  education  become  statistically  non-significant  also  for 
Portuguese scores, and do not change significantly the estimated coefficients of the other covariates.18 

                                                                                       
17

 MEC established a minimum participation rate in ENEM of 50% of the students for a school to have its results reported. As 
this filter would restrict the sample size to only 1,907 schools, we chose to restrict the sample of schools based on the median 
of the 2009’s participation rate distribution, which was 33.3%, which resulted in 5,349 schools remained in the base.

As we have seen in last section the validity of such estimates can be compromised by the presence 
of  teachers  selection  bias,  since  chances  to  be  employed  in  better  schools  are  higher  for  those  teachers 
with higher education. To deal with this problem, following the strategy of propensity score matching, we 
first estimate logit models of probability of treatment on a set of pre-treatment schools characteristics for 
each of the binary treatment variables defined in Section 4. The set of covariates used in this model and 
the criteria for their inclusion can be seen in Table 13.

We  then  apply  the  Radius  matching  method  to  generate  weights  for  the  schools,  in  order  to 
guarantee  that  an  appropriate  (that  attend  to  both  selection  on  observables  and  common  support 
assumptions)  matching  between  treated  and  control  schools.  Once  paired  the  samples  for  all  treatment 
conditions,  differences  in  means  between  control  and  treatment  groups  of  all  covariates  become 
statistically non significant, which support the validity of selection on observables assumption. Also, for 
all  paired  samples  the  estimated  propensity  scores  densities  are  overlapping,  which  indicates  that  the 
schools in the common support present similar pre-treatment characteristics (balancing property).19 

Table  14  presents  a  summary  of  the  Treatment  Effect  on  Treated  Schools,  estimated  from 
Equation  (1)  controlling  by  the  same  set  of  student  and  school  characteristics  considered  in  previous 
regressions,  for  both  no-matched  and  matched  samples.20  The  coefficients  for  the  no-matched  sample 
[column  (1)]  are  positive  and  statistically  significant  only  for  the  schools  that  experienced  the  greatest 
increase  in  percentage  of  Portuguese  classes  taught  by  teachers  with  higher  education  (Treated  3)  and 
with Higher Education in Portuguese (Treated 4). However, for matched samples [Columns (2) and (3)], 
the first coefficient becomes statistically non-significant and the coefficient of Treated 3 related to Higher 
Education in Portuguese becomes statistically significant at 10% of significance.  

Thus, the initial results indicate that the only change in teachers’ education indicators capable of 
affecting students’ scores was that related to the increase in Percentage of Portuguese Classes Taught by 
Teachers  with  Higher  Education  in  Portuguese,  especially  among  the  schools  that  had  the  highest 
increases (Treaded 4). For these schools, whose indicator was below 43% [or 20.1%, on average] in the

year  2009  and  has  risen  above  94%  [or  99.9%,  on  average]  in  the  year  2015,  the  estimated  ATT  is 
between  6.9  and  7.5  points  in  Portuguese  exam,  what  implies  in  an  mean  increase  between  0.086  and 
0.094 points for every 1 percentage point increase in teachers education indicator. This estimated effect is 
about  3 times the one previously estimated in  the regressions without characterizing the treatment  from 
binary variables, which considers all schools [see Table 13, Columns (10) to (12)].

Again, in order to verify the robustness of the results in relation to the presence in the sample of 
schools with low student participation rates in ENEM, we re-estimate the model for the restricted sample, 
which excludes schools whose participation rate in 2009 was below the median of the distribution. As we 
can  see,  the  estimated  coefficients  for  non-matched  sample  are  all  statistically  non-significant,  with  the 
exception of the coefficients for  Treated 2,3 related to the effect of the increase in the Teachers Higher 
Education on math scores and for  Treated 4 related to  the effect  of the increase in  the Teachers Higher 
Education in Portuguese on Portuguese scores.  

In  regressions  on  paired  samples  [Columns  (5)  and  (6)],  however,  the  only  coefficients  that 
remains  statistically  significant  are  those  for  Treated  2,3  related  to  the  effect  of  the  increase  in  the 
Teachers  Higher  Education  on  math  scores,  and  the  coefficient  of  Treated  3  related  to  the  effect  of  the 
increase  in  the  Teacher  Higher  Education  on  math  scores  becomes  statistically  significant  at  10% 
significance for the sample matched by the Kernel method. In special, the coefficients related to Higher 
Education in Portuguese on Portuguese scores become all statistically non-significant. 

In summary, the results indicate that the increase in Teacher Higher Education in Portuguese that 
occurred  in  Treated  3  and  Treated  4  schools  (most  intensively  treated  schools)  may  have  positively 
affected students’ Portuguese scores, but  that this result is  not  robust to  schools participation restriction 
on  ENEM.  Also,  the  increase  in  Teacher  Higher  Education  seems  to  have  positively  affected  students’ 
math  scores  of  Treated  2,3  schools  (those  whose  indicator  was  below  73.3%  in  2009  and  raised  above 

 

16 

87.5% in 2015). For these schools, whose indicator was below 73.3% [or 45.8%, on average] in the year 
2009 and has risen above 87.5% [or 99.2%, on average] in the year 2015, the estimated ATT is between 
4.2 and 4.5 points in math exam, what implies in an mean increase between 0.079 and 0.084 points for 
every 1 percentage point in Percentage of Math Classes Taught by Teachers with Higher Education. 

Table  15  presents  a  summary  of  the  so  called  negative  Treatment  Effect,  also  estimated  from 
Equation  (1)  controlling  by  the  same  set  of  characteristic  for  both  whole  sample  and  matched  samples. 
Again, the estimated results on the paired samples are statistically non-significant, except for the effect on 
Portuguese  scores  of  school  in  Treatment  group  2  in  relation  to  the  Percentage  of  Portuguese  Classes 
Taught by Teachers with Higher Education in Portuguese, whose coefficient is positive and significant at 
10% significance only when considering the sample matched by Radius method.

After  restricting  the  sample  by  participation  in  ENEM  exam,  the  only  statistically  significant 
coefficients are those related to the effect of the decrease in Teacher Higher Education on  Treated 1,2,3 
schools  scores in  Portuguese (schools whose indicator was  above 72.7%  in  2009 and dropped to  below 
72.7%  in  2015).  These  schools  seem  to  have  benefited  from  the  reduction  in  the  percentage  of  higher 
educated  teachers  in  the  period,  which  may  reflect  a  strategy  of  exchanging  higher  educated  but  lower 
performance teachers by newer teachers, who perform better despite the lower schooling. 

The  results  do  not  allow  us  to  reject  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  effect  on  Portuguese  scores,  and 
despite the statistically significant positive effects on math scores from the increase in percentage of math 
classes taught by teachers with higher education, we find no statistically significant effect from teachers 
with  higher  education  in  math.  The  lack  of  effect  on  Portuguese  scores  is  consistent  with  the  several 
studies  that  find  no  correlation  between  teachers  education  and  student  learning  (Hanushek  and  Rivkin 
(2006), Harris and Sass (2011)), and the positive effect on math scores partly contradicts the findings of 

 

17 

Wayne and Youngs (2003), that reports that upper secondary school students learn more math only when 
their teachers have higher training in mathematics, and no effect in relation to other areas of knowledge. 
 
7. Conclusions 

There  are  only  few  rigorous  studies  that  relates  teachers  educational  background  and  training  to 
the  students'  performance.  Given  the  total  amount  of  public  and  private  investments  to  provide  higher 
education training and the central role of teachers in student learning, understanding the relations between 
pre-service training and teachers’ quality is essential to shed light on the changes capable of reversing the 
learning crisis in Brazil. The present study aimed at contributing to fill this gap in applied research. 

We estimated the ATT effect of the change in the percentage of secondary school classes taught 
by  teachers  with  higher  education  and  with  higher  education  degree  in  the  field  on  the  achievement  in 
math  and  Portuguese  of  12  graders  students  of  public  schools  at  ENEM,  through  a  combination  of 
differences-in-differences  and  propensity  score  matching  methodologies.  In  summary,  we  find  no 
evidence of positive effects on Portuguese scores, and despite the statistically significant positive effect of 
the rise in teachers with higher education on math scores, we find no effect from specific math training. 

The incapacity of teacher education to influence students learning can have diverse origins. First, 
the  quality  of  the  teacher  may  be  mostly  determined  by  characteristics  other  than  pre-service  training, 
such  as  school  performance  records  and  innate  skills.  In  this  sense,  the  admission  of  weak  educational 
background individuals in pre-service training could explain the absence of impact on the quality of the 
teaching. This seems consistent with the fact that tertiary teacher training courses are among the easiest 
ones  to  access  in  Brazil.  Low  competition  to  enroll  in  these  courses  reflects  the  low  attractiveness  to 
higher performance graduates of basic education. 

A second explanation is based on the idea that lack of effect may be due to the inadequacy and/or 
poor quality of teacher training programs themselves, assuming that teacher quality is a function of pre-
service training.21 In this regard, Wayne and Youngs (2003) and Rice (2003) find positive effects of the 
quality of teachers’ pre-service education on students learning. Section 2 shed some light on the issue for 
Brazilian  case,  where  there  was  a  significant  change  in  the  profile  of  teacher  training  courses,  with  the 
rapid expansion of distance learning and other recent changes in the higher education provision structure.  
Our results point to a fragility in the training of teachers in the field of both math and Portuguese. 
It  is  likely  that  licenciatura  courses  are  failing  to  compensate  for  the  learning  deficits  accumulated  by 
their graduates during basic education. It is also possible that the incorporation of bachelor degree holders 
with stronger knowledge in these fields may contribute to raise the quality of upper secondary education. 
In this regard, the pedagogical supplementation certification may contribute to raise quality of teaching. 
However, the percentage of these certified teachers from 11.4% to 3.3% between 2011 and 2015 and only 
1.2% of math classes and 0.6% of Portuguese classes in public upper secondary education were taught by 
those  teachers  in  2015.  This  low  share  may  be  due  to  a  lack  of  supply  in  pedagogical  supplementation 
certification courses, the excessive increase of required duration for certification, selection barriers in the 
official exams, or simply the absence of interest of bachelor degree holders in joining teaching career.  

The convergence of teacher wages of public upper secondary  school  towards the average wages 
received  by  other  professionals  with  higher  education  degree  and  the  reform  of  the  national  basic 
education core curriculum may influence professionals with non-education degree to join teaching career 
and the universities to change their pre-service curriculums. Incentives could be created to promote both 
changes  through:  (i)  a  reduction  of  the  duration  of  pedagogical  supplementation  for  a  specialization  of 
360h to  allow join the public system top  performance professionals  with  higher  education (it requires a 
change  in  the  resolution  of  the  CNE);  (ii)  promoting  colleges  or  universities  to  restructure  their 
curriculum  of  licenciatura  degrees  in  accordance  with  the  new  national  core  curriculum  through 
requirements in students loans in private institutions and scholarship programs in public universities.  

It is still necessary, however, to deepen the analysis in search of understanding the reasons of low 

effectiveness of training teachers in leveraging learning of students from public schools.
