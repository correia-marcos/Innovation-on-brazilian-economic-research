1.  INTRODUCTION 

This  paper  aims  to  measure  the  positive  effects  of  governamental  support  to 

innovative activities on business firms’ R&D investments in Brazil using microdata from 

the Brazilian Innovation Survey 2003, 2005 and 2008 editions. 

Governmental  support  to  innovative  activities  is  usually  justified  on  the  grounds  that 

innovative  activities  are  subject  to  characteristics  that  cause  underinvestment. 

Imperfect  appropriability,  high  level  of  uncertainty  and  the  tacit  character  of 

knowledge justify governmental intervention.  

On  the  one  hand,  a  large  number  of  scholars  have  argued  that  governmental 

intervention  on  the  technology  environment  has  paid  off  (Mazzucato  2012,  Block 

2008,  Pelei  2006).  They  base  their  assertions  on  the  existence  of  an  entrepreneurial 

state  that  has  provided  knowledge  and  capabilities  to  the  carrying  out  of  innovative 

activities  of  business  firms.  On  the  other  hand,  another  stream  of  the  literature  has 

dedicated  efforts  to  measure  the  effects  of  R&D subsidies,  either  through  grants  and 

contracts, or through tax incentives, on private R&D investments. This latter literature 

has  got  a  rather  blurred  picture  about  the  effects  of  governmental  subsidies  on 
business firms’ R&D investments (David, Hall and Toole 2000, Hall and Reenen 2000).  

This  paper  is  dedicated  to  the  measurement  of  this  latter  issue  for  Brazil.  The 

relevance  of  this  investigation  is  that  in  recent  years  Brazil  has  strongly  shifted  its 

technology  policy,  improving  governmental  funding  and  grants  mechanisms  and 

extending  tax  incentives  to  R&D  to  the  whole  business  scenario.  It  is  therefore 

important to assess the impacts of this shift to contribute for policy making. 

The paper is organized in  five sections, including this introduction. In the  next section 

we  present  our  analytical  and  historical  background.  The  database  and  method  of 

analysis  are  described  in  section  three.  Section  four  shows  and  discusses  the  results 

from the analysis. Section five is dedicated to driving some conclusions.  

2.  ANALYTICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND  

2.1. Reasons for public support to innovative activities  

Innovative activities involve different sources of  knowledge and multiple applications. 

Knowledge  sources  may  be  related  to  new  scientific  knowledge, but  may  also  involve 

the  transfer  of  knowledge  from  customers  to  companies  or  even  across  different 

business firms. Therefore, the innovative process involves a complex system of market 

and  hierarchical  relations  (Fagerberg  2005).  Knowledge  has  some 

important 

characteristics.  First,  it  is  an  intangible  asset,  though  it  may  be  at  least  partially 

codified.  Second,  it  is  imperfectly  appropriated  and  thus  knowledge  has  public  good 

characteristics. It is non-rival, in the sense that the use of knowledge by one part does 

not  affect  its  use  by  another  part.  It  is  also  partially  non-excludable.  Partially  non-

excludability  derives  from  the  fact  that  in  order  to  absorb  knowledge  it  may  be 

necessary previously accumulated capabilities and skills and in some cases new effort. 

In  this  sense  R&D  is  characterized  by  having  two  faces:  one  that  is  dedicated  to  new 

solutions and the other that is characterized by the constitution of absorptive capacity 

(Cohen  and  Levinthal  1989).  Third,  it  is  not  perfectly  codified;  tacit  knowledge  is 

present  and  the  transmission  of  knowledge  may  require  interaction  between  agents 

and,  mostly  important,  the  transmission  may  be  costly.  Fourth,  knowledge  has  a 

cumulative character. Therefore, the knowledge effort made today may have an effect 

on  tomorrow’s  absorptive  capacity.  Fifth,  it  is  specific  in  the  sense  that  it  may  be 

applied to certain pattern of solutions but not to others. 

Innovative activities are also uncertain. Freeman (1989) relates investment in R&D and 

other  innovative  activities  to  high  level  of  uncertainty.  He  argues  that  apart  from 

effective  demand  uncertainty  (common  to  physical  capital  investments),  innovative 

activities  are  subject  to two  additional  types  of uncertainty: technological  uncertainty 

and  market  uncertainty.  Technological  uncertainty  is  associated  with  the  risk  of  not 

solving  technological  problems,  for  technology  outcomes  are  unknown.  Market 

uncertainty  is  the  risk  that  a  firm incurs  about  the  acceptance  of  the new  product by 
the market.  

The  presence  of  uncertainty  challenges  Modigliani-Miller’s  hypotheses  of  perfect 

financial markets, by which internal or external financing would be provided as long as 

the desired project has a positive net present value. In this sense, internal and external 

financing will not be neutral. Therefore, either lenders’ and/or borrowers’ risks would 
be affected.1 The presence of uncertainty may therefore deepen underinvestment.  

These  characteristics  stress  the  cause 

for  state 

intervention 

in 

innovative 

environments or activities. Pavitt (2005)  lists some cases where  governmental policies 

have  directly  influenced  and  funded  research  in  some  areas.  ICT  and  civil  aviation  in 

the  US  have  been  developed  through  projects  that  have  their  origin  in  Ministry  of 

Defense programs; high speed trains in France and Japan have been developed having 

governmental  programs  to  support  them.  Pavitt  (2005)  also  establishes  the  lines  of 

argument  for  framing  pros  and  cons  of  governmental  support,  stressing,  on  the  one 

hand, the presence of pressure groups and opportunity costs, and,  on the other hand, 

the  occurrence  of  commercial  constraints  and  the  gains  and  externalities  of  early 

technological learning and accumulation for international competition. 

Examples  of  the  role  of  technological  learning  and  accumulations  are  given  by 

Mazzucato  (2012)  that  shows how the  state  in  the  US has  engaged  in  Schumpeterian 

entrepreneurship due to the need to deal with uncertainty. Therefore, US government 

                                        
1 See Ughetto (2008) for a list of the five main sources for the preference for the use of internal sources 
in R&D investments. 

            

has  defined  new  broad  areas  of  technological  development  and  has  been  able  to 

provide  the business sector with knowledge necessary to develop major technological 

breakthroughs. 

Block  (2008)  argues  that  US  has  kept  hidden  a  developmental  State  that  has 

implemented  a  series  of  successful 

interventions.  The  emergence  of 

this 

developmental state is linked to the military disbursements for science and technology 

that  played  a  key  role  in  the  development  of  computers,  jet  planes,  civilian  nuclear 

energy,  lasers,  and,  ultimately,  biotechnology.  He  claims  that  Pentagon’s  Advanced 

Research  Project  Agency  (ARPA)  was  a  key  player  in  planning  and  defining  what 

technologies  to  explore  and  that  this  methods  have  been  adopted  in  other 

governmental  programs  and  agencies.  In  the  National  Institute  of  Health,  ARPA’s 

methods  were  used  to  develop  the  main  initiatives  related  to  biotechnology  and 

genetic  experiments  that  gave  the  US  a  leading  edge  in  these  technologies.  Block 

(2008)  argues  that  other  bills,  such  as  the  Small  Business  Investment  Company,  have 

been  proposed  and  efforts  have  been  carried  out  to  consolidate  this  developmental 

state. According to his research, the results are unchallenged:  

“For  forty-five  years,  R&D  Magazine  has  been  recognizing  the  one  hundred 

most innovative commercial products introduced in the previous year. In 1975, 

forty-seven  out  of  eighty-six  domestic  innovations  were  produced  by  Fortune 

500companies,  and  forty  of  these  involved  no  outside  partners.  By  2006,  the 

big firms were responsible for only six out eighty-eight innovations, and in most 

cases, they  had partners. In 2006, fifty of these innovations were the products 

of  researchers  at  U.S.  government  laboratories,  universities,  or  other  public 

agencies,  working  alone  or  in  collaboration with private  firms.  Another  eleven 

innovations  came  from  supported  spin-offs,”  relatively  new  firms  started  by 

scientists or technologists that had received considerable Federal funding both 

before  and  after  thefirm’s 

founding.  Of  the  remaining  twenty-seven 

innovations  that  belonged  to  private  sector  organizations,  at  least  another 

sixteen involved Federal dollars” (Block 2008:187). 

There  are  also  plenty  of  examples  outside the  US. Peilei  (2006)  argues  for  the  central 

role  of  government 

in 

the 

technological  development  of 

the  Chinese 

telecommunications 

industry  that  took  the  country  from  a  net 

importer  of 

telecommunication equipment to being a net exporter. Hansen, Rand and Tarp (2008) 

show a positive effect of different types of government intervention on firm growth in 

the Vietnamese case.   

On  the  other  hand,  Lerner  (2010)  argues  that,  although  uncertainty  and  externalities 

are  present,  there  is  always  a  risk  that  government  will  fail  to  direct  resources  to 

support  inept  programs.  This  risk  is  usually  related  to  the  quality  of  institutions. 

Furthermore,  influence  of  some  actors  in  the  technological  and  political  scene  may 

lead  to  waste  of  resources  and  agency  problems  may  arise.  Thus,  Lerner  (2010) 

suggests  that  caution  should  be  taken  in  understanding  non-technology  and  non-

production  obstacles  to  success  and  that  market  signals  should  be  respected.  Lerner 

(2010)  also  uses  case  studies  as  well  to  question  the  wisdom  of  wide  governmental 

intervention in innovative efforts.  

Another  stream  of  the  literature  investigates  a  second  type  of  governmental 

intervention: the use of government subsidies for R&D. Policy instruments in this case 

involve  R&D  grants,  subvention,  funding  and  tax  incentives.  A  large  set  of  studies 

attempt to measure the effect of governmental intervention regressing some measure 

of innovativeness, firm growth or productivity growth on governmental intervention or 

subsidies.  

David, Hall and Toole (2000) survey the literature on the effect of government finance 

and  grants  on  private  R&D  showing  mixed  results.  They  stress  however  that  most 

studies  find  a  positive  relationship  between  these  variables,  although,  as  argued  by 

Wallsten  (2000),  they  may  show  correlation  rather  than  causality.  Wallsten  (2000) 

analyzes  the  conceding  of  grants  to  innovative  enterprises.  He  argues  that  it  is  most 

likely  that  government  officials  fund  projects  that  are  commercially  viable  and  that 

would  find  their  way  to  success  by  market  means  and  therefore  that  government 

intervention  should  be  more  likely  to  crowd  out  private  R&D  efforts.  In  the  opposite 

direction,  screening  the  same  program,  Link  and  Scott  (2010)  find  that  a  high 

percentage of the research carried out by firms under the SBIR program  grants would 

not have taken place if the grant was not to be conceded. Furthermore, Link and Scott 

(2010a)  find  that  a  high  percentage  of  the  program  initiatives  end  up  being 

commercialized  but  another  part  does  not  get  into  commercialization  at  all,  showing 

that  the  selection  procedure  is  not  as  targeted  as  suggested  by  Wallsten.  Gelabert, 

Fosfuri and Tribó (2009) have tested the issue of the  impact of governmental support 

on  private  R&D  of  Spanish  firms.  They  find  a  consistent  positive  effect  of  public 

support  on  private  R&D  investment,  though  the  effect  is  dependent  on  the  level  of 

appropriability of the firm’s sector.   

Hall  and Reenen  (2000)  survey  the  literature  on the  effect  of  subsidies  on R&D.  They 

find  a positive  tax  elasticity  of  R&D  that  is  around one,  in  the  long  run,  and lower,  in 

the short run, due to adaptation issues. Their final conclusion is that it is worthwhile to 

provide  tax  incentives  as  social  return  to  R&D  tend  to  be  greater  than  the  private 

returns,  therefore,  an  increase  in these  returns  may  take  private  R&D levels  closer  to 

optima public levels.   

2.2. The Brazilian Institutional Framework 

The  Brazilian  governmental  support  to  innovations  involves  the  supply  of  non-

reimbursable and reimbursable funds, equity emission and equity sharing agreements 

to the supply of risk capital for small and medium enterprises, and fiscal incentives for 

innovation  (Bastos  2012).  In  the  beginning  of  the  2000’s,  the  amount  of  supply  of 

funds  for  innovation  averaged  less  than  R$  1.5  billion  a  year.  From  2004  on,  the 

Brazilian innovation policy suffered a major shift and, in 2010, the governmental funds 
to  innovation  reached  almost  R$  10  billion  a  year.2 The  increase  in  the  amount  of 
expenditures  was  due  to  important  policy  initiatives  carried  out  by  the  government. 

The  Innovation,  Technology  and  Trade  Policy  (PITCE)  was  the  first  step  taken  by  Luis 

Inácio Lula da Silva’s government in terms of a general framework of innovation policy. 

Articulated  to  the  general  framework  of  the  PICTE,  a  number  of  policies  and 

regulations  have  been  put  in  place  to  strengthen  Brazil’s  science  and  innovation 

potential.  The  Innovation  Law  (2004)  was  designed  to  strengthen  the  university–

industry  research  relationships,  promoting  the  shared  use  of  science  and  technology 

infrastructure by research institutions and firms, allowing direct government grants for 

innovation in firms and stimulating the mobility of researchers within the system. The 

transfer of university knowledge to companies would be achieved mainly by means of 

the  obligatory  creation  of  Technological  Innovation  Nuclei  (TIN)  at  universities  and  b 

the  release  of  laboratories  and  equipment  to  be  shared  between  science  and 

technology  institutions  (STI)  and  companies.  Furthermore,  for  the  first  time  in  the 

country  the  public  resources  could  be  transferred  as  non-refundable  funds  for 

enterprises,  sharing  the  costs  and  risks  of innovative  activities.  The  enactment of  this 

law  thus  permitted  the  creation  of  the  Economic  Subsidy  program,  in  2006, 

coordinated by FINEP, which provides resources for research and development (R&D) 

activities at the company. 

Law  11.196  was  enacted  in  2005  to  reinforce  advances  of  the  Innovation  Law.  It  was 

replaced  in 2007 by  Law 11.487,  which  became  known  as the  “Goodwill  Law”  (Lei do 

Bem).  This  Law  speeds  up  and  expands  incentives  for  investments  in  innovative 

activities, authorizing the automatic use of fiscal benefits for companies that invest in 

R&D  and  are  within  requirements,  without  any need  of  a  formal  request.  The  special 

tax  regime  and  fiscal incentives  for  companies  created  by the Goodwill  Law  stipulate, 

among  others:  deductions  from  income  tax  and  social  contributions  on  net  profits 

from  expenses  on  R&D  (between  60%  -  100%),  reductions  in  the  tax  on  industrial 

products  for  purchasing  machines  and  equipment  for  R&D  (50%),  economic  subsidies 

through  scholarships  for  researchers  in  companies  and  an  exemption  from  the 

                                        
2 In  total, from 2000 to 2010, the Brazilian government directed more than  R$ 50 billion  to innovation 
funds.  Most  resources (55%) have been channeled to companies using fiscal subsidies,  revealing a bias 

            

of  these  policies  toward  large  firms.  Most  small  firms  use  the  SIMPLES  (simple)  option  for  collecting 

income  taxes.  In  this  modality,  income  taxes  are  a  fixed  percentage  of  total  revenue,  disregarding  any 

specific conduct of the firm and not considering its costs and expenditures structures. Therefore, these 

firms  are  not  eligible  for  fiscal  incentives  to  innovative  activities.  This  kind  of  bias  is  clear  in  the 

institutional framework that was developed during the last decade, which emphasized fiscal incentives. 

Contribution  for  Intervention  in  the  Economic  Domain  (CIDE)  for  patent  deposits.  It 

also  includes  funding  to  firms  who  hire  employees  with  Masters  Degrees  and  PhDs. 

The  subsidy  can  reach  up  to  60  per  cent  of  the  salary  in  the  North  East  and  Amazon 

regions and 40 per cent in the rest of the country for up to three years. 

In  order  to  broader  the  focus  of  the  industrial  policy,  the  Productive  Development 

Policy  (PDP)  was  launched  in  2008  with  the  objective  of  sustaining  the  process  of 

economic  growth,  increasing  investment  and  economic  growth  rates.  The  main 

challenges  are  the  expansion  of  supply  capacity  in  the  country,  preserving  the 

robustness  of  the  balance  of  payments,  raising  the 

innovation  capacity  and 

strengthening  micro  and  small  enterprises.  Four  priorities  were  established  to  be 

achieved  by  2010:  the  increase  of  investment  rate, the  expansion of Brazilian  exports 

in  world  trade,  the  increase  of  R&D  expenditures  and  the  increase  in  the  number  of 

SME  exporters.  PDP  also includes  spending  targets  and  tax  breaks  for  key  sectors  like 

IT, biotechnology and energy as well as plans to increase international trade from 1.18 

per  cent  in  2007  to  1.25  per  cent  by  2010,  with  a  emphasis  in  high  tech  exports. 

Targets include boosting the number of micro and small businesses  that export goods 

and services by more than 10 per cent in 2010. One of the main objectives of strategy 

embodied  in  PDP,  although  not  explicit,  is  to  raise  the  innovation  capacity  of  the 

productive  sector.  In  fact, it  is  not  clear  what  is meant by  innovation  capacity  and  no 

indicators  are  offered  in  the  policy  document  to  measure  the  achievement  of  the 

objective.  The  main  goal  set  is  to  raise  private  business  research  and  development 

(R&D)  expenditures to 0.65% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2010,  over 0.51% of 

GDP in 2005. In addition, the accessory objective set is to double the number of patent 

deposits of Brazilian enterprises  in the local patent office (INPI) and triple the number 

of patent deposits abroad. 

3.  METHODOLOGY 

3.1. The Database 

The  paper  uses  data  from  the  Brazilian  Innovation  Survey  (PINTEC)  2003,  2005  and 

2008 editions. PINTEC has been published in four different editions, for the years 2000, 

2003,  2005  and  2008.  PINTEC  sample  design  produce  statistically  significant  samples 

for  companies  in  the  10  to  29,  30  to  99,  100  to  249,  250  to  499  and  covers  all 

companies  with  500  or  more  companies.  The  samples  are  also  built  in  order  to  have 

statistically  significant  representation  per  two-digit  International  Standard  Industrial 

Classification  (ISIC).  Also,  PINTEC  attempts  to  cover  all  companies  that  have  received 

any  governmental  support,  declared  to  have  formal  R&D  labs  or  applied  for  patents. 

PINTEC  2003  covered  a  sample  of  10,000  manufacturing  and  mining  firms;  PINTEC 

2005  covered  a  sample  of  13,575  firms;  and  PINTEC  2008  a  sample  of  14,355.  These 

samples  may  be  statistically  expanded  to  over  100,000  firms.  From  2005  on,  PINTEC 

has  included  service  firms  in  their  sampling.  We  restrict  our  analysis  to  Mining  and 
Manufacturing firms.  

The  paper  selects  and  uses  only  innovative  companies  that  were interviewed in  the 

three  PINTEC  editions.  Firms  are  considered  innovative  if  they  have  introduced 

process  or  product  innovations  that  consist  in  novelty  to  their  previously  used 

processes or previously produced  products in at least one of the three editions. 2,601 

firms  fell  into  those  criteria.  Table  1  shows  the  size  characteristic  of  the  sample.  On 

average, companies have over 900 employees. In 2008, the average size of firms in the 

Manufacturing  and  Mining  Industries  was  less  than  30  employees.  Therefore,  our 

sample is biased towards large firms.  

We  have  chosen  a  conduct  variable,  R&D  intensity,  represented  by  the  ratio  of  R&D 

expenditures  to  sales,  to  capture  the  effect  of  governmental  policies  and  to  be  the 

dependent  variable  of our  regressions.  The  sample  has  an  average  R&D  to  sales  ratio 

of 0,8% (see Table 1). The standard deviation is quite high, due to the large number of 

events  where  firms  appear  with  zero  R&D  expenditures:  4,380.  It  should  be  stressed 

that  half  of  the  variance  is  explained  by  within  group  effects,  that  is,  there  are  quite 

large variations in firms’ own R&D intensity across the years.  

As has been stated in the previous section there are a large number of options funding 

assistance  to  innovative  investments,  R&D  grants  and  fiscal  subsidies  to  innovative 

activities that the innovative firms can engage into. 

The  2003,  2005  and  2008  editions  ask  whether  companies  have  used:  (i)  fiscal 

incentives to R&D (law 8.661 and law 11.196); (ii) the law of informatics incentives (law 

10.664  and  law  11.077);  (iii)  governmental  grants  for  R&D  performance  (law  10.973 

and 

law  11.196);  (iv)  governmental  financial  support  for  R&D  activities;  (v) 

governmental  financial  support  for  the  acquisition of  machinery  and  equipment used 

to  introduce  innovation;  (vi)  grants  for  the  hiring  of  researchers  from  governmental 

support  agencies;  (vii)  governmental  support  to  risk  capital.  The  distribution  of  these 

benefits  across  firm  size  is  presented  in  Figure  1.  Fiscal  incentives  seem  to  dominate 

the setting in larger firms and acquisition of machinery equipment in smaller firm sizes. 

So,  in  some  cases,  selection  biases  may  exist,  but  in  others  they  are  unlikely  to  be 

present.  Some  of  the  selection  biases  will  be  related  to  innovative  capabilities,  but 

others will not.  

We  have  chosen  to  approach  the  subject  by  building  a  dummy  variable  that  takes 

value  one  if  the  firm  has  received  governmental  support  and  value  zero  if  it  did  not 

receive  governmental  support.  Table  1  shows  the  average  number  of  firms  that  are 

being  supported  in  the  whole  sample  and  the  overall,  between  and  within  group 

variance in our sample. It is shown that about 40% of the overall variance is explained 

by  within  group  variance,  that  is,  firms  that  have  received  governmental  support  in 

one  period  and  have  not  have  received  governmental  support  in  some  other  period, 

while 60% of the variance is explained by between group variance. This characteristic is 

quite  important  for  we  are  capturing  effects  of  governmental  intervention  in  firms’ 

own R&D portfolio as much as we are capturing differences across firms.

Table 2 shows by two-digit ISIC code the number of times firms have been classified as 

supported  and  non-supported  in  our  sample.  In  average,  23.51%  times  we  have 

classified  firms  as  governmentally  supported.  It  should  also  be  observed  that 

governmental  support  is  unevenly  distributed  across  sectors  and  across  size  (see 

Figure 2).  

Since  Schumpeter’s  Capitalism,  Socialism  and  Democracy,  economists  have  been 

worried  and  have  formulated  hypotheses  about  the  relation  between  innovative 

behavior and firm size and innovative behavior and market structure (Cohen and Levin 

1989).  There  are  two  Schumpeterian  hypotheses.  The  first  one  states  that  firms  with 

greater  market  power  are  more  likely  to  be 

innovative  and  therefore  more 

concentrated  markets  should  be  able  to  deliver  greater  innovativeness  and  firms  in 

these  markets  should  have  higher  R&D  expenditures.  The  second  Schumpeterian 

hypothesis was actually formulated by Galbraith and states that larger firms should be 

able  to  carry  out  greater  innovative  efforts  and  therefore  to be  more  innovative.  The 

paper  includes  firm  size  and  market  concentration  variables  to  deal  with  these 

hypotheses. Firm size is represented by the natural logarithm of the firm’s number of 

employees and market structure  is represented by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index of 

the firms’ market share at Brazilian Economic Activities Classification (CNAE 1) .

However,  technological  regimes  may  affect  the  effect  of  firm  size  and  market 

concentration  on  innovative  behavior  and  performance.  Different  types  of  firm  and 

market structures will have different  interactions with different technological regimes 

(Malerba  and  Orsenigo  1996,  Malerba  2005,  Breschi,  Malerba  and  Orsenigo 

2000).Furthermore,  technological  regimes  may  affect  the  size  of  the  effect  of 

governmental  support  on R&D  (Gelabert,  Fosfuri  and  Tribó  2009).  In order  to  control 
for these effects, we include two-digit CNAE1 sectoral sectoral dummies.   

We also include three additional firm level variables: (i) the rate of change of product 

in  the  market,  which  is  the  answer  to  PINTEC’s  question  number  7,  that  asks  the 

duration of  the  product in the  market. We  value the  answer  from 0  to  3,  three  being 

the  fastest  rate;  (ii)  the  age  of  the  firm in number  of  years;  and  (iii)  the nationality,  a 

dummy that values 1, if the firm is a multinational, and 0, otherwise. Table 1 presents 

descriptive statistics for the variables.

3.2. Empirical Strategy 

The paper presents two sets of models. First, it runs a tobit pooled data model in  the 

form: 

ܴܦ௜௧

∗ = max൫0, ࢞௜௧ࢼ + ݑ௜௧ ൯    

(1) 

Tobit pooled data models maintains an specified relation between ݑ௜௧ , the error term, 
and ࢞௜௧ ,  the  vector  of  independent  variables.  It  also  does  not  account  for  serial 
correlations between the error term and the dependent variable.  

Second, the paper estimates a tobit random effects panel data model: 

ܴܦ௜௧

∗ = max൫0, ࢞௜௧ࢼ + ܿ௜ + ݑ௜௧ ൯  

 

(2) 

where ܿ௜is an unobserved variable.  

The  estimation  of  the  effects  of  governmental  support  on  private  R&D  suffers  from 

problems  due  to  self-selection  and  governmental  official  selection  problems,  that  is, 

first, private companies, mostly small ones, may be attracted to present themselves for 

governmentally  financed  programs  In  order  to  access  easy  money.  This  may  be  the 

main  source  of  income  in  some  of  these  companies  due  to  their  overall  activity  and 

R&D  intensity.  Therefore,  these  programs  are  more  likely  to  attract  R&D  intensive 

firms.  Second,  governmental  officials  tend  to  select  firms  that  are  more  likely  to 

innovate  to  prove  the  effectiveness  of  their  programs.  These  effects  should  however 

be  more  relevant  whenever  dealing  with  grants  and  governmental  financing  of  R&D 

activities. In the case of tax incentives, they should not be present, though there could 

be some important cost transfer problems.  

Still, the paper uses the random effects panel data and the sampling strategy to tackle 

problems related with selection biases in three fronts: 

(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

They  deal  with  unobserved  individual  variables,  the ܿ௜′ݏ,  that  is,  variables 
that may be affecting the results but are not included in the regression; 

They provide a more homogeneous set of firms by choosing only innovative 

firms and therefore reducing selection biases; and 
They provide counterfactual cases both within and between groups. 

The  paper  first  presents  for  each  of  the  models  the  results  for  firm  specific 

characteristics  and  then  it  introduces  concentration  variables  and,  finally,  sectoral 

dummies to account for differences in technological regimes. 

4.  RESULTS 

The  results  to  the  regressions  are  presented  in  Table  3.  Equations  (1)  through  (3) 

present  Tobit  pooled  data  models,  while  equations  (4)  through  (6)  present  random 

effects  models.  Equations  (1)  and  (4)  deal only  with  firm  specific  variables,  equations 

(2)  and  (5)  include  market  concentration  variables  and  equations  (3)  and  (6)  include 

apart  from  market  concentration,  two-digit  sectoral  dummies.  Random  effects 

equations add explanation. The rho value in equations 4, 5 and 6 is positive and shows 

that random effects add an explanation to the whole variance of higher than 30%. 

Before discussing the result for the governmental support it is interesting to point out 

that  the  equations  reject  both  Schumpeterian  hypotheses.  Firm  size  is  always 

negatively related to R&D intensity and though the quadratic form has a positive sign, 

the  returns  do  not  become  negative  until  firms  are  over  90,000  employees,  which 

cover  the  whole  sample  of  firms.  Concentration  is  positively  correlated  with  R&D 

intensity, but  it loses significance when sectoral dummy variables are introduced. Age 

is, as expected, negatively correlated with R&D and the multinational dummy assumes 

a  positive  value,  though  it  loses  significance  in  equation  6,  again  when  sectoral 

dummies are introduced.  

In all six equations, governmental support is the most significant explanatory variable. 

The  effect  on  R&D  intensity  varies  from  2.7  (in  equation  6)  to  3.8  (in  equation  1) 

percentage points. It can be observed that as one includes more control variables, the 

effect of the governmental support variable decreases. The result is on line with  most 

of  the  early  studies  (see  David,  Hall  and  Toole  2000)  that  show  a  positive  effect  of 

governmental  support  on  R&D  intensity.  Some  important  comments  should  be  made 

on this result. First, the result does not measure a real per real relationship rather the 

relation between a dummy variable and an R&D intensity variable. The paper does not 

strike  the  effect  that  a monetary  unit of  subsidy will have  on net business  firms’ R&D 

expenditures.  Therefore,  one  important  issue  treated  by  David,  Hall  and  Toole  (2000) 

and  Wallsten  (2000)  on  the  complementarity/substitutability  of  public  and  private 

expenditures  is not  assessed  in  this  paper.  However,  the dimension  of  the  coefficient 

suggests  that  effects  are  quite  high  and  that  probably  complementarity  applies. 

Second, the paper does not separate by type of subsidy. Therefore, some further work 

is  still  to  be  carried  out  in  order  to  fully  qualify  the  results.  Third,  one  may  raise 
suspicion that there are still endogenous features to be cut off from the analysis.  

However,  the  paper  presents  some  lessons  to  be  followed.  In  section  3,  we  have 

stressed  the  occurrence  of  a  major  shift  in  technology  policy  in  Brazil.  Policies  were 

first focused on a few sectors and concentrated on tax incentives. From 2004 on, new 

instruments have been created and firms have been able to adhere to new policy lines. 

Figure  3  shows  that  there  was  a  sharp  increase  in  the  number  of  firms  covered  by 

governmental  programs.  The  number  of  firms  covered  by  governmental  programs 

almost doubled in 2008, compared to 2003. These doubling also came with a structural 

shift.  In  2003  most  of  the  governmental  support  to  innovation  occurred  through  the 

acquisition  of  machinery  –  which  is  mostly  related  to  embodied  technology  and  has 

very  few  effects  on  the  production  of  new  knowledge  inside  the  corporation  –  and 

through tax incentives. In 2008, two new types of programs have appeared: economic 

subvention  and  finance  to  autonomous  projects.  This  shows  a  quality  shift  as  well. 

Based  on  the  results of  this paper, one  can  argue  that  the  shift in policy has been  on 

the  right  direction.  Governmental  support  to  innovation  seems  to  obtain  positive 

results in terms of R&D investment. 

One  should  furthermore  focus  some  attention  on  the  problems  suffered  by  these 

policies  with  high  percentage  of  large  firms  involved  (see  Figure  2).  Some  attention 

must  be driven  to the  fact that  technology policy has  mostly  targeted large  firms  and 

that positive  effects  can be obtained if more  emphasis is put on  firms  of  smaller  size. 

Though policy lines have shifted, still little has been obtained and, as shown by Bastos 

(2012) most resources still go to tax incentives where only large firms are benefited.

A  final  topic  to  be  addressed  from  the  results  here  obtained  is  the  tradeoff  between 

policies.  The  paper  has  argued  that  business  firms  alter  their  behavior  in  the  willing 

direction in response to policy incentives. If resources are scarce, a further step would 

be  to  assess  the  results  of  different  science  and  technology  instruments  to  optimize 

the  allocation  of  governmental  resources.  In  this  sense,  some  further  work  may  be 

carried  out  in  order  to  see  the  benefits  of  alternative  allocations  of  science  and 

technology resources. 

5.  CONCLUSIONS  

This  paper  has  aimed  to  measure  the  effects  of  governmental  support  to  innovative 

activities on private R&D. The paper has used data from PINTEC 2003, 2005 and 2008 

editions  to  capture  these  effects.  The  main  conclusion  of  the  paper  is  that 

governmental support has a positive effect on R&D expenditures. 

The  paper  then  addressed  some  issues  related  to  science  and  technology  policy.  The 

paper  argues  that  technology  policy  is  still  imperfect  and  that  some  attention  should 

be driven to the asymmetries between large and small firms. Larger firms  seem to be 

privileged  by  governmental  policies,  though  recent  shifts  have  attenuated  this 

shortcoming. Furthermore, the paper recommends further assessments on concurrent 

instruments in order to better shape Brazilian technology policy.
