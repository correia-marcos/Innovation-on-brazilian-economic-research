Abstract:  The  objective  of  the  present  paper  is  to  show  that  the  macroeconomic  performance  of 
Brazilian economy in the last 12 years was mainly the result of shocks in terms of trade, where the 
exceptional  improvement  in  the  terms  of  trade  occurred  from  2006  was  a  major  cause  of  over-
valuation of real exchange rate, but also contributed to maintain inflation rate at low levels, to increase 
real wages and to reduce unemployment rate to a historically very low level. The exchange rate over-
valuation that was caused by the improvement in terms of trade was a driving force in the process of 
de-industrialization of Brazilian economy from 2006 on, since it induced a substitution of domestic 
production for imports, which explains the stagnation of industrial output after 2011 in a context of 
growing domestic absorption. This means that Brazil had very clear symptoms of “Dutch Disease”. 
The recession that started in Brazil in the last quarter of 2014 was mainly the reflection of a negative 
shock in terms of trade, which resulted in inflation acceleration, decreasing real wages and growing 
unemployment  rate.  The  positive  side  of  this  scenario  is  that  real  exchange  rate  returned  to  a 
competitive  level  in  the  second  semester  of  2015,  which  can  give  a  start  in  a  possible  re-
industrialization of Brazilian economy.

Resumo: O objetivo reside em mostrar que o desempenho macroeconômico da economia brasileira 
nos últimos 12 anos foi principalmente o resultado de choques nos termos de troca. Nota-se que a 
variável termos de troca foi uma das principais causas do excesso de valorização da taxa de câmbio 
real, mas que também contribuiu para manter a taxa de inflação em níveis baixos, auxiliou no aumento 
dos salários reais e na redução da taxa de desemprego para um nível historicamente baixo. A sobre-
apreciação da taxa de câmbio que foi causada pela melhoria dos termos de troca foi uma força motriz 
na  processo  de  desindustrialização  da  economia  brasileira  após  2006,  uma  vez  que  induziu  a 
substituição  da  produção  doméstica  por  importações,  o  que  explica  a  estagnação  da  produção 
industrial após 2011, em um contexto de crescente absorção doméstica. Isso significa que o Brasil 
tinha sintomas claros de "Doença Holandesa". A recessão que começou no Brasil no último trimestre 
de  2014  foi  principalmente  o  reflexo  de  um  choque  negativo  nos  termos  de  troca,  resultando  na 
aceleração da inflação, quada dos salários reais e crescente taxa de desemprego.

1 – Introduction.   

From  2003  to  2010  Brazilian  economy  experienced  a  period  of  high  growth  rates  with 
moderate levels of inflation. Average growth rate of GDP was 4.06% p.y during this period and the 
average  rate  of  CPI  growth  was  5.79%  p.y.  This  relatively  good  macroeconomic  performance 
changed dramatically after 2011. Average growth rate was reduced to 1.59% p.y in the period 2011-
2014, a reduction of almost 61% in average growth compared to the previous period. At the same 
time  inflation  accelerated  to  6.17%  p.y.  Moreover,  for  the  period  2015-2016  market  forecasts  for 
GDP growth showed a contraction of almost 8% in real output, at the same time that average inflation 
should rose to 7.5% p.y. This dramatic change in macroeconomic performance was mainly due to the 
stagnation  of  industrial  output  which  started  at  the  end  of  2010.  The  combined  effects  of  chronic 
exchange rate overvaluation - due to improvement in terms of trade - and profit squeeze - due to the 
wage growth above productivity growth - resulted in a fast reduction of external competitiveness of 
Brazilian manufacturing sector, inducing a substitution of domestic output for imports. Moreover, the 
reduction of profit rate in manufacturing sector, due to the reduction in profit margins, resulted in a 
contraction of investment in new machines and equipment, worsening the productivity problem of 
Brazilian  manufacturing  sector.  Federal  Government  in  Brazil  tried  to  solve  this  problem  by  the 
implementation of a new macroeconomic regime, the so-called New Macroeconomic Matrix. This 
macroeconomic regime was characterized by an easing of fiscal and monetary policies in order to 
increase aggregate demand. From the second semester of 2011 to the first semester of 2013, nominal 
interest rates were reduced as well as taxes over manufactured products. The result was a very modest 
increase in growth rate of GDP in 2013 in comparison with 2012, at expense of inflation acceleration 
and a reduction in the primary surplus of federal government (Oreiro, 2015). In the second semester 
of  2013,  due  to  inflationary  pressures,  Brazilian  Central  Bank  started  a  process  of  adjustment  in 
monetary policy, increasing the level of nominal interest rate. This change in monetary policy resulted 
– combined with the uncertainty generated by the political scandal of corruption inside PETROBRAS 
– in a growth deceleration in 2014, when Brazilian economy showed a growth rate of only 0.1%. The 
combined effects of tax reduction, growth deceleration and increase in interest rates resulted in a huge 
worsening of fiscal position of public sector. Indeed, the primary surplus of 1.8% of GDP in 2013 
was  transformed  into  a  primary  deficit  of  almost  0.7%.  Moreover  the  nominal  deficit  increase  to 
almost 7% of GDP at the end of 2014, starting from a level of 3,26% in November of 2013. As a 
result of worsening of fiscal position of public sector, Federal Government, in the beginning of 2015, 
had to start a fiscal adjustment, designed to stop the continuous increase in the ratio of public debt to 
GDP. This change in the fiscal policy, combined with a very tight monetary policy had contributed 
to worsen the growth perspectives of Brazilian economy. After a fall of almost 4% of real GDP in 
2015, the consensus among  analysts  of the financial sector is  that  Brazilian economy  will show a 
contraction of 3% in  2016. The objective of the  present  paper is  to  show that the macroeconomic 
performance of Brazilian economy in the last 12 years was mainly the result of shocks in terms  of 
trade, where the exceptional improvement in the terms of trade occurred from 2006 was a major cause 
of overvaluation of real exchange rate, but also contributed to maintain inflation rate at low levels, to 
increase real wages and to reduce unemployment rate to a historically very low level. The exchange 
rate overvaluation that was caused by the improvement in terms of trade was a driving force in the 
process of de-industrialization of Brazilian economy from 2006 on, since it induced a substitution of 
domestic production for imports, which explains the stagnation of industrial output after 2011 in a 
context of growing domestic absorption. This means that Brazil had very clear symptoms of “Dutch 
Disease”. The recession that started in Brazil in the last quarter of 2014 was mainly the reflection of 
a negative shock in terms of trade, which resulted in inflation acceleration, decreasing real wages and 
growing unemployment rate. The positive side of this scenario is that real exchange rate returned to 
a  competitive  level  in  the  second  semester  of  2015,  which  can  give  a  start  in  a  possible  re-
industrialization  of  Brazilian  economy.  The  article  is  organized  in  five  sections,  including  the 
introduction. In Section 2 we present our theoretical framework, which is a three goods version of the 
Dependent  Economy  Macroeconomic  Model.  In  Section  3  we  made  a  descriptive  analysis  of 

2 

 

macroeconomic performance of Brazilian economy from 2003 to 2015. In section 4 we made present 
some  empirical  evidence  regarding  the  role  of  terms  of  trade  shocks  in  the  macroeconomic 
performance  of  Brazilian  economy  through  the  use  of  correlation  analysis  and  multivariate  time 
series. In section 5 we present a brief summary of the conclusions. 

2 – Terms of Trade, Real Exchange Rate and Real Wages in a Dependent Economy Model 

In this section we will present a three goods dependent economy macroeconomic model based 
on  Agenor-Montiel  (1999)  in  order  to  analyze  the  effects  of  changes  in  terms  of  trade  over  real 
exchange rate and real wage of medium-income countries that are rich in natural resources as Brazil. 
Although  the  standard  macroeconomic  model  for  small  open  economies  is  the  Mundell-Fleming 
version of IS-LM, this framework is not suited to discuss the effects of changes in terms or trade since 
it  assumes  an  economy  that  specializes  in  the  production  of  a  single  (composite)  good,  which  is 
imperfect substitute for the single (composite) good that produced in the rest of the world (Agenor-
Montiel, 1999, p.52). In this setting there is no possible way to distinguish between terms of trade 
and real exchange rate. In order to do that it is necessary to introduce a three sector economy model 
with two tradable sectors and one no-tradable sector. Real exchange rate will be defined as the ratio 
between price of tradable and non-tradable goods, and terms of trade will be the ratio between export 
and import prices of tradeable goods. Terms of trade will be exogenous to domestic economy, which 
gives rise to its “dependent” nature. The model to be presented bellow can solved in order to show a 
full-employment (classical) or unemployment (Keynesian) equilibrium. Since the qualitative effects 
of changes of trade over real exchange rate and output composition does not depend on the type of 
equilibrium, we will focus our analysis only on the full-employment equilibrium.  

Let us consider  a dependent  economy that  had three sectors ℎ = (𝑥, 𝑖, 𝑛): a tradable  sector 
that produces a good that can´t be consumed in domestic markets (primary sector), another tradable 
sector  that  produces  a  good  that  can  be  consumed  either  in  domestic  or  external  markets 
(manufacturing) and a non-tradable sector (services). The output of each sector is supposed to be a 
function of the quantity of labor employed, which is the only input used in production.  Production 
technology of each sector is given by:  

𝑦ℎ = 𝑦ℎ(𝑛ℎ)    (1) 

𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒:  𝑦ℎ

´  (𝑛ℎ) > 0; 𝑦ℎ

´´ (𝑛ℎ) < 0  

Supposing that in all sectors firms operate in conditions of perfect competition and firms to 

be profit-maximizers, the aggregate labor demand in each sector is given by:  

𝑑 = 𝑛𝑥
𝑛𝑥

𝑑 (

𝜔

∗    (3𝑎) 

Where E is  the nominal exchange rate defined as the price of foreign currency in  terms  of 
domestic currency. Regarding the nominal exchange rate we will suppose the existence of a system 
of fixed exchange rate. Without loss of generality we can normalize E as equal to one. Price of non-

tradable  goods is  determined domestically. Domestic demand for manufactured and non-tradeable 
goods is taken to depend on the relative prices of the two goods, given by the real exchange rate, and 
on the total domestic absorption measured in terms of manufactured goods, 𝑎 , given by:  

Let  us  suppose  that  the  real  domestic  absorption  of  both  manufactured  and  non-tradeable 

 
goods is given by:  

𝑎 = 𝑎𝑖  +

      (4) 

𝑎𝑛
𝑧

𝑎 = 𝑎(𝜃; 𝑔)     (5)   

Where: 𝑔 is the real value of government expenditure and  

𝜕𝑎

𝜕𝜃

> 0; 

𝜕𝑎

𝜕𝑔

> 0 .Thus absorption 

depends positively on the terms of trade as well as on the shift parameter g. From equations (4) and 
(5) we can see that an increase in government expenditures and/or an improvement in terms of trade 
will result in an increase in domestic absorption. Changes in real exchange rate can displace domestic 
absorption  from  manufacturing  to  service  sector  and  vice-versa,  being  one  of  the  fundamental 
determinants of composition of output. Market-clearing in the non-tradable sector is:  

𝑦𝑛(𝑧𝜔) =   𝑎𝑛(𝑧; 𝑎);  

𝜕𝑦𝑛
𝜕𝑧𝜔

< 0    (6) 

 

Trade balance measured in units of manufacturing goods is given by:  

𝑏 = 𝜃𝑦𝑥 (

𝜔
𝜃

) + 𝑦𝑖(𝜔) − 𝑎𝑖(𝑧, 𝑎)  (7) 

Regarding the labor market, we will suppose that supply of labor is inelastic and equal to 𝑛̅. 

 
This means that full employment condition is given by:  

𝑛̅ = 𝑛𝑥

𝑑 (

𝜔
𝜃

) + 𝑛𝑖

𝑑(𝜔) + 𝑛𝑛

𝑑  (𝑧𝜔)    (8)      

 
In  order  to  solve  the  model,  we  will  suppose  that  terms  of  trade  are  exogenous,  being 
determined in the international markets. Being so, the model has three independent equations [(6)-
(8)] with three endogenous variables: z, 𝜔 and b. The system of equation is determinate. Putting (5) 
into (6) and taking the total derivative of the resulting equation we get:  

𝑑𝑧 = −

𝑎𝑛,2 (𝜕𝑎

𝑑𝑔     (9) 

 
From equation (9) we can derive the slope of NN curve, that is the loci of all combinations of 
real exchange rate and real wage rate for which there is market for non-tradable goods clears.  Taking 
𝑑𝜃 = 𝑑𝑔 = 0 in (9) we arrive at:

𝑑𝑍
𝑑𝜃

𝑎𝑛,2(𝜕𝑎

´ 𝜔 − 𝑎𝑛,1

  < 0  (9𝑏) 

 
That  is  for  a  given  real  wage  rate,  an  improvement  in  terms  of  trade  will  result  in  an 
appreciation of real exchange rate. In order to restore market clearing it is necessary to increase the 
level of output for non-tradeable goods. Since the real product wage in the non-tradeable sector is 
given by 𝑧𝜔, then real exchange rate has to appreciate, reducing the real product wage and thereby 
increasing the profit-maximizing level of employment. This will increase the level of output in the 
non-tradeable sector, eliminating the excess demand for non-tradable goods. Returning to the full-
employment condition, taking the total derivative of equation (8) we get:

From equation (10) we can derive the slope of LL curve, that is the loci of all combinations 
of real exchange rate and real wage rate for which full employment condition is met. Taking 𝑑𝑛̅ =

An improvement in the terms of trade, holding real exchange rate constant, will produce an 
increase in the level of real wage. Equations (9b) and (10b) show that an improvement in terms of 
trade is associated with a real exchange appreciation and an increase in the level of real wages, which 
can be seen in Figure 1.

This occurs because an improvement in terms of trade cause a reduction of real product wage 
in the primary sector, increasing the labor demand and real output of this sector. Since economy is 
working  at  full  employment,  in  order  to  increase  output  in  the  primary  sector,  workers  had  to  be 
transferred from the manufacturing and service sectors, what will require an increase in the real wage 
paid in the primary sector. Due to the fact labor is supposed to be a homogenous input and also due 
to  the hypothesis of perfect  mobility of labor between sectors,  an increase in  the real  wage in  the 
primary sector will result in an increase of real wage in the manufacturing and service sector as well. 
Due to the increase in real wages, real output and employment of the manufacturing sector will be 
reduced, given rise to a classic problem of “Dutch Disease”2.  

3 – Macroeconomic Performance of Brazilian Economy (2003-2015) 

This section presents first a descriptive analysis of the temporal variables real exchange rate, 
terms of trade, real wages, the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP), share of the gross fixed 
capital formation on GDP, share industry GDP on GDP, unemployment, inflation, real interest rates, 
share  of  the  public  sector  borrowing  requirements  on  GDP,  international  reserves  and  external 
accounts in the period 2003-2015, during the administrations of Presidents Luis Inacio Lula da Silva

3.1 – Real Exchange Rate Over-Valuation under Lula Government, 2003-2010 

From  the  first  quarter  of  2003  to  the  last  quarter  of  2005,  real  exchange  rate  presented  an 
appreciation of 33.98% (Figure 2). According to some studies about exchange rate misalignment, as 
the one of Oreiro, Punzo and Araujo (2012), real exchange rate in Brazil started to become overvalued 
in second quarter of 2004, reaching a level of 18% of overvaluation in the last quarter of 2007. In 
2006, Central Bank of Brazil begun to make sterilized interventions in exchange rate market by means 
of buying an enormous quantity of international reserves and sterilizing its effects over high powered 
money by selling Treasury bonds in  Repurchase  Agreements (Repo) operations. The consequence 
were the international reserves had grown at a rate of 50.7% in 2006 and 97.98% in 2007, reaching 
more than US$  206 Billion in  September of 2008 (Figure 4);  while Repo increased  from  1.7% of 
GDP in 2005 to 10.4% of GDP in 2008. This huge accumulation of international reserves meant that 
the free floating exchange rate regime was substituted by a de facto managed exchange rate regime, 
although without an explicit or even an implicit target for nominal exchange rate. The objective of 
the new exchange rate regime seemed to be to reduce and eventually stop the process of real exchange 
rate appreciation3.  Indeed, the pace of exchange rate appreciation was greatly reduced after 2006. 
Between 2003.Q1 to 2005.Q4, real exchange rate depreciated 33.98%, this rhythm of appreciation 
was reduced to just 8.06% in the period 2006.Q1 to 2008.Q3. 

It is also important to notice that export performance of Brazilian economy until 2005.Q3 was 
not due to an improvement in the Terms of Trade. As we can see in Figure 2, from the first 2003.Q1 
until 2005.Q3, the index of terms of trade remained almost constant around a level of 95. A modest 
improvement of 12.79% in terms of trade would only begin in the 2006.Q1, when the index of terms 
of trade increased from 96.45 to 108.75 at the end of the period4.  The export performance of Brazilian 
Economy  from  first  quarter  of  2003  to  last  quarter  of  2005  was  mostly  due  to  the  level  of  real 

                                                           
3 According with trilemma of Robert Mundell it is impossible to have at the same time capital mobility, autonomous monetary policy 
and managed exchange rate. Since Brazil had an open capital account and an inflation targeting regime, then a managed exchange rate 
was not a policy option. In this setting making sterilized interventions in exchange rate markets could only be ineffective over the level 
of nominal exchange rate (See Garcia, 2011). The first problem with this trilemma is that it does not consider the possibility of some 
sort of compromise between these options. For instance, a country may decide to impose some capital controls in order to have an 
autonomous monetary policy with a managed exchange rate (Bresser-Pereira, Oreiro and Marconi, 2014, p. 152). Capital account in 
Brazil is better characterized by imperfect capital mobility, due to the remaining capital controls (for instance, domestic currency, the 
REAL, is not convertible) and imperfect substitution between domestic and foreign bonds. Under these circumstances it is possible for 
the Central Bank to control the quantity of money (or rate) and nominal exchange rate at the same time (Montiel, 2011, chapters 6-8).     
4 It is noteworthy to see in figure 2 that until the 2005.Q3, real exchange rate appreciation can´t be the result of the improvement in the 
terms  of  trade.  During  this  period  terms  of  trade  remained  practically  constant,  but  real  exchange  rate  appreciated  almost  38%. 
Exchange rate appreciation is mainly due to the strong reduction in country risk premium occurred in this period (1200 to 250 b.p.).

exchange rate, that remained under-valued at least the end of 2004 (Oreiro, Punzo and Araujo, 2012, 
p. 926), and the strong growth of world economy during this period. 

Another important element for explaining macroeconomic performance is wage policy, more 
precisely, the policy for minimum wage. Between January of 1999 and February of 2006, minimum 
wage had an increase of 30.87% in real terms or an average real increase of 4.44% during this period. 
From March of 2006 to February of 2008, however, minimum wage had a real increase of 16.82%, 
i.e. a real increase of 8.4% p.y. during the entire period, almost twice of the increase observed in the 
last period. This acceleration of the rate of increase in minimum wage was due to a wage rule that 
President Lula negotiated with Labor Unions in 2007. According to this rule, the rate of increase in 
minimum wage from one year to the other will be equal to the rate of inflation observed in the last 
year plus the growth rate of real GDP observed two years before. The minimum wage policy also 
helped the increase in real wages (Figure 2). The implicit objective of such a rule was to induce an 
increase in the wage share, due to the fact that real wages are expected to increase at rate higher than 
labor  productivity.  This  should  produce  an  improvement  in  income  distribution  and  also  boost 
effective demand through the effect of increasing wage share over consumption expenditures. The 
increased consumption expenditures should induce capital accumulation by private sector due to the 
traditional accelerator effect. The final result should be an increase in investment rate (Figure 3) and 
hence  an increase of  growth rate of potential output.  Indeed,  flexible  tripod should achieve also  a 
higher rate of growth, stability of real exchange rate and a higher wage share (Figure 2 and 3).  

The growth performance of Brazilian economy in this period – called “growth spectacle” by 
President  Lula  –  allowed  a  remarkable  reduction  in  open  unemployment  rate  (Figure  2).  Indeed, 
President Lula first term had started with an unemployment rate around 13%. After reaching a peak 
of 13,8%% of labor force in the 2004.1, open unemployment rate begin to fall, around 8,7% of labor 
force in 2008.4. Up to Q3.2008, real exchange rate appreciation did not seem to produce any serious 
harm to  the performance of  Brazilian manufacturing sector. The  share of  industrial  GDP on GDP 
(Figure  3)  increased  from  12.34%  in  the  2002.Q4  to  14.09%  in  the  2008.Q3.  Compared  to  the 
2005.Q3, industrial GDP on GDP had fallen almost 1.0%, from 15.09% to 14.09%. It is noteworthy 
that this decreasing in the manufacturing share occurred almost at the same time of the reversion in 
the  current  account  from  surplus  to  deficit  and  the  growth  acceleration  in  period  2006-2008  (see 
Figure 5). These are clear signs that manufacturing sector was losing its dynamism due to the behavior 
of real exchange rate.  Facing a fall of almost 30% of industrial output and 14% in GDP occurred in 
the  2008.4,  Brazilian  government  reacted  by  means  of  a  strong  fiscal  expansion5,  followed  some 
months after by a considerable easing of monetary policy. At the same time, public banks  (Banco do 
Brasil and Caixa Econômica Federal) made a considerable increase in their credit lines in order to 
solve the credit crunch appeared after the collapse of international financial markets in 2008.Q4.  

The world financial crisis has a modest and temporary effect over Brazilian macroeconomic 
performance.  From  2008.Q4  to  2009.Q3  real  GDP  growth  was  reduced,  causing  an  increase  in 
unemployment rate above 11.6% of labor force (Figure 3). The combined effects of fiscal, monetary 
and credit expansion allowed Brazilian economy to recover quickly from 2008 crisis, exhibiting a 
real growth rate of 9,22% of GDP in the 2010.Q4 (Figure 3). Labor market reacted also very fast to 
aggregate demand stimulus, making unemployment rate to fall back at the level in the 2008.Q4. Just 
after  the  bankruptcy  of  Lehman  Brothers,  nominal  exchange  rate  in  Brazil  had  suffered  a  huge 
depreciation due to the precautionary demand for foreign currency by domestic residents in order to 
fulfill their commitments in future and derivative markets (Oreiro-Basilio, 2011). This movement of 
nominal  exchange  rate  produced  a  temporary  reversal  of  the  tendency  for  exchange  rate  over-
valuation observed in the period 2003-2008 (Figure 2). In the 2009.Q3, however, real exchange rate 
started again to appreciate. As matter of fact, from 2009.Q3 to 2011.Q4 real exchange rate had an 
appreciation of 19%, reaching its lowest level since 2003.   

                                                           
5 According to data of National Treasury, between 2008 and 2009, primary expenditures of federal government increased R$ 74.28 
billion, an increase of 14.91% in nominal terms.

In the period 2003.Q1 to 2008.Q9 the appreciation of real exchange rate in Brazil was due to 
the combined effects of reduction in sovereign risk premium (up to the 2005.Q4) and improvements 
in terms of trade (from the beginning of 2006 on). Now the real exchange rate appreciation appeared 
to be mainly the result of improvement in terms of trade. As we can see in Figure 2, terms of trade 
increased 24% between the 2009.Q3 to 2011.Q4. In order to face the real exchange rate appreciation 
problem,  Central  Bank  of  Brazil  continued  its  policy  of  intervention  in  exchange  markets  buying 
additional  quantity  of  international  reserves  (Figure  4).  The  international  reserves  increased  at  an 
average rate of 22.01% p.y in the period 2009-2011, reaching a value of US$ 352 billion at the end 
of 2011, an increase of almost 82% between 2008 and 2011. These interventions on foreign exchange 
market, however, are not fully sterilized. As we can see in Table I, the stock of Repo in R$ million 
and as a share of GDP had increased in 2009, but decreased strongly in 2010, showing that Central 
Bank  of  Brazil  had  increased  the  stock  of  high  powered  money  to  finance  the  acquisition  of 
international reserves. These developments were possible because the world financial crisis induced 
an easing of monetary policy in Brazil that resulted in a sharp decrease of nominal short-term interest 
rate.  The  combined  effects  of  improvement  in  terms  of  trade  and  reserve  accumulation  allowed 
Brazilian  economy  to  maintain  a  good  average  performance  in  the  external  fragility  indicators 
between 2008.Q4 to 2011.Q4  (external debt  as a ratio of GDP,  12,36%,  external  debt  on exports, 
122.31%,  reserves  on  external  debt,  112.22%,  and  current  account  on  GDP,  -2.41%),  clearly 
indicating a situation of solvency of external accounts  despite the over-valuation of real exchange 
rate. International reserves were larger than external debt, indicating that Brazilian economy had also 
a very comfortable liquidity position.

Table I – Evolution of Repo operations (2009-2011) 

The  behavior  of  current  account/GDP  ratio  (Figure  5)  indicated  a  clear  and  growing  over-
valuation or real exchange rate. In only two years, from 2008.Q4 to 2010.Q4, current account/GDP 
deficit almost double, increasing from 1.81% of GDP to 3.43% of GDP.  Since the increase in current 
account  deficit  (Figure  5)  was  followed  by  a  huge  improvement  in  terms  of  trade  (Figure  2),  this 
could  only  be  the  result  of  substitution  of  domestic  production  for  imports  in  the  manufacturing 
sector. The first symptoms of Dutch Disease were beginning to appear in Brazilian economy. 

But, without questioning the conduction of economic policy, comparing 2003 with 2010, the 
Lula  government  was  able  to  reduce  the  real  interest  rate,  the  nominal  interest  rate,  inflation  and 
unemployment. Brazil grew on average more than in the 90s and increased real income of the worker, 
the rate of investment on GDP and achieved investment grade by agencies of sovereign risk rating. 
There  was  a  strong  decline  in  public  debt  as  a  proportion  of  GDP.  This  exceptionally  good 
macroeconomic performance allowed the election of Dilma Rouseff from Labor Party (Partido dos 
Trabalhadores) as President of Brazil in 2010.Q4, as successor of Lula.   

3.2 – Stagnation and Recession under Dilma Government, 2011-2015 

The  substitution  of  domestic  production  for  imports  in  Brazilian  manufacturing  industry 
caused a stagnation of manufacturing output from the beginning of 2011 on. After a quickly recover 
of the effects of world financial crisis, output of manufacturing industry remained roughly constant 
at the beginning of 2011, despite Brazilian economy was still growing at a higher, although declining. 
Manufacturing industry was clearly loosing dynamism due to over-valuation of real exchange rate.

Dutch disease was becoming to cause a negative structural change in Brazilian economy, reducing 
the industrial GDP on GDP (Figure 3). A second wave of de-industrialization had begun (Oreiro and 
Feijó, 2010). The strength of de-industrialization of Brazilian economy could be seen. From 2008.Q4 
to 2011.Q4 manufacturing share in GDP had fallen from 13.92% to 11.8%, a decrease of 15.23% in 
the manufacturing share in only three years. From the 2011.Q4 until the 2013.Q3, Brazilian economy 
had  experienced  a  strong  growth  deceleration.  As  we  can  see  in  Figure  6,  the  12  month  moving 
average of real GDP growth fallen from 5.39% p.y in the 2011,Q4 to 0.84% p.y in the 2013.Q3.

Figure 6: Real GDP Growth and Manufacturing Industry Output (2011.Q4-2013.Q3) 

Moreover, the 12 month moving average of output in manufacturing industry had fallen 1.55% 
during  this  period.  After  a  quick  recover  of  2008  financial  crisis,  production  of  manufacturing 
industry  in  Brazil  stagnated,  and  this  situation  was  slowing  down  GDP  growth.  The  slowdown  in 
economic growth was not due to a cyclical downturn caused by a Keynesian problem of insufficiency 
of aggregate demand. During this period the output gap was positive, showing that Brazilian economy 
was growing above its potential or natural growth rate. The problem seemed to be a structural one: 
the potential growth rate was being reduced. Another way to see that growth deceleration was not due 
to a fall of aggregate demand is to compare the behavior of sales in the commercial sector with the 
behavior of manufacturing industry output. As we can see in Figure 7, although manufacturing output 
was declining up to the end of 2012, sales in the commercial sector were growing at a robust average 
rate of 5.62% p.y in real terms.

Thus  the  problem  did  not  seem  to  be  insufficiency  of  aggregate  demand,  but  the  revealed 
incapacity of Brazilian industrial firms to had access to effective demand. This means that stagnation 
of Brazilian economy was more likely to be the effect of real exchange rate appreciation (Figure 2) 
over  competitiveness  of  Brazilian  manufacturing  industry  both  in  external  and  domestic  markets 
(Bresser-Pereira, Oreiro and Marconi, 2014, chapter 6).   

The nature of Brazilian stagnation problem can be seen in Figure 8, where it is presented the 
temporal series of the 12 month moving average of Real Effective Exchange Rate/Wage ratio from 
January of 2003 to December of 2014. Since the beginning of President Lula government, Brazilian 

 

10 

manufacturing sector was losing external competitiveness and profit margins due to the combined 
effect of real exchange rate appreciation and increasing wages.

Figure 8: Evolution of Real Effective Exchange Rate-Wage Ratio (2003.1-2014.12) 

This process was stopped, but not reversed, under President Dilma Rouseff government. The 
stagnation of manufacturing industry output combined with a strong expansion of domestic demand 
resulted in the continuation of de-industrialization of Brazilian economy, measured by the industrial 
GDP  on  GDP  (Figure  3).  Due  to  the  fact  that  manufacturing  industry  is  the  source  of  increasing 
returns, this structural change resulted in a reduction of potential growth rate. The de-industrialization 
of Brazilian economy must not be under-estimated. From 2008.Q4 to 2014.Q4, the 12-month moving 
average of industrial GDP on GDP had fallen 32.13%, from 14.75% to 10.01% 6.Facing deceleration 
of GDP growth and a stagnation of industrial output since 2011, Brazilian government answered in 
the same way it done in 2008, by means of a new round of easing monetary and fiscal policy, trying 
to  boost  aggregate  demand.  One  of  the  objectives  of  easing  monetary  policy  was  to  induce  a 
depreciation of nominal exchange rate in order to reduce or even eliminate the over-valuation of real 
exchange rate. This means that monetary policy in Brazil clearly incorporated as one of its objectives 
to stabilize the real exchange rate, but without an explicit commitment with a target for nominal or 
real level of exchange rate. In order to avoid a conflict between the stabilization of real exchange rate 
and  inflation  targeting,  Central  Bank  of  Brazil  choose  to  make  an  informal  spreading  of  the 
convergence  period  from  one  year  to  the  “relevant  period  for  monetary  policy  to  operate”,  which 
means, in practice, that monetary authority has no commitment with any definite period for inflation 
to converge for the center of the target (4.5% p.y), although annual inflation must be lower than the 
ceiling defined by CMN (6.5% p.y). This means that in order to make possible an adjustment of real 
exchange rate, Central Bank of Brazil would tolerate a higher inflation rate, between 5.0% and 5.5% 
p.y, instead of 4.5% p.y. A higher real exchange rate was been traded for a higher inflation rate.  

Along with easing of monetary policy, Brazilian Central Bank tried to continue its intervention 
in  foreign  exchange  markets  by  means  of  buying  international  reserves  (Figure  4).  From  2011  to 
2012, Central Bank continued to increase international reserves at a rate of almost 20% p.y as it was 
done in previous years (after 2006). From 2012 on, however, the rate of reserve accumulation slowed 
down and then reversed in 2014. Clearly, the policy of reserve accumulation was now reaching its 
limits. From 2011 to 2012, reserve accumulation required a large increase in REPO operations as we 
can see in Table I in order to avoid a decrease in short term interest rate greater than the one desired 
by Brazilian Central Bank. At the end of 2013, REPO operations were near 10% of GDP, representing 
almost 20% of gross public debt. The large size of international reserves together with the size and 
cost of REPO operations were making the continuation of reserve accumulation a very costly policy 
for Brazilian Government. Due to the increasing fiscal difficulties that National Treasury started to 

                                                           
6 The re-primarization of exports signaled for a clear reduction in the growth rate that is compatible with the equilibrium in the balance 
of payments (Thirwall, 2002). For an empirical analysis of the impact of real exchange rate over income elasticities of exports and 
imports see Marconi, Araujo and Oreiro (2015).

face after 2013, the intervention in foreign exchange market by means of reserve accumulation would 
be stopped in 20147.   

Regarding  the  fiscal  policy,  Ministry  of  Finance  decided  that  a  reduction  of  the  primary 
surplus/GDP  was  both  possible  and  required.  The  reduction  of  real  interest  rate  due  to  easing  of 
monetary policy had reduced the primary surplus/GDP that was required to stabilize (net) public debt 
as  a  ratio  to  GDP8.  This  means  that  fiscal  space  was  created,  allowing  an  easing  of  fiscal  policy. 
Besides that, growth deceleration observed after 2011 signaled a weakness of aggregate demand that 
would demand some fiscal stimulus.  The issue was not if a fiscal stimulus was needed, but what form 
the fiscal stimulus must have. The decision of the Minister of Finance, Guido Mantega, was to use 
the  fiscal  space  to  promote  a  semi-permanent  round  of  tax  reduction  for  both  productive  sector 
(mainly automobile industry) and consumers instead of an increase in Public Investment, as it was 
defended by the Vice-Minister, Nelson Barbosa. The impact of this decision over the path of primary 
surplus were negative. The declared objective of the new macroeconomic regime according to the 
Finance Minister Guido Mantega9 was to produce a change in the combination of interest rate and 
exchange rate towards a lower nominal and real interest rate and a more competitive real exchange 
rate in order to (i) boost capital accumulation and economic growth in the medium term; (ii) stimulate 
manufacturing industry and revert the de-industrialization of Brazilian economy.  

Which was the result of the so-called New Macroeconomic Matrix? Growth almost stagnated, 
reaching  an  average  of  only  1.73%  p.y.  Despite  growth  deceleration,  output  gap  was  positive  on 
average during this period, indicating that Brazilian economy was growing above potential and also 
that growth potential was reduced. As a consequence, de-industrialization continued its course with 
manufacturing share reaching 10.29% in the 2014.Q1 (Figure 7). The failure of new macroeconomic 
matrix can be partially explained by the behavior of real exchange rate (Figure 2). The real exchange 
rate depreciated but this movement was not enough to restore real exchange rate at the level observed 
in the 2006.Q1, when it looked to be at a very comfortable level for both manufacturing industry and 
current account. Compared to the level 2006.Q1, real exchange rate remained with an over-valuation 
of  12.23%  in  the  2013.Q4.  The  surprising  feature  of  the  period  was  the  revealed  incapacity  of  a 
remarkable low level for real short-term interest rate to stimulate economic growth.  

Thus Brazilian economy was experiencing a  classical  situation of  profit squeeze  (Table  II) 
which had clear and strong negative effects over the rate of capital accumulation and moderate effect 
on the gross fixed capital formation on GDP (GFCF/GDP).

7 If average inflation was 5.15% in the second term of President Lula, in the period of 2011 to 2013, average inflation rose to 6.08% 
p.y. After the popular protests of 2013, the political conditions in Brazil made impossible for the government to tolerate greater inflation 
acceleration, making Central Bank to give up the attempt of adjusting real exchange rate to a more competitive level.

         From the first quarter of 2011 until last quarter of 2012, the moving average of the growth rate 
of investment decreased, reaching minus 4.4% p.y at the end of this period. During 2013 investment 
growth  experienced  a  temporary  recover  may  be  due  to  the  lagged  effects  of  monetary  and  fiscal 
policy  easing, but  it started again to  fall in the beginning of 2014.  Another important  element  for 
explaining  why  exchange  rate  over-valuation  did  not  cause  a  worsening  in  the  external  fragility 
indicators was the behavior of terms of trade. In the period 2011-2013 (Figure 2) the terms of trade 
remained stable at very high levels, sustaining the value of exports, despite the exchange rate over-
valuation.  At the end of 2013, however, terms of trade became to deteriorate, signaling clearly the 
end of commodity boom that begun in 2006. This would have a very strong and negative effect in 
Brazilian economy in 2014 and 2015, helping to transform a situation of economic stagnation in a 
depression  of  economic  activity.  We  observe  strong  sharp  decline  in  the  the  following  variables 
(Figures 3 and 4): growth rate of GDP, the investment rate, the share of investment to GDP, the share 
of industrial GDP on GDP and public sector borrowing requirements on GDP. Open unemployment 
rose from 6.9% to 13% in less than two years. From 2012 on, terms of trade became to deteriorate, 
but  remained at  a higher level  until the beginning of 2014. At the end of this  year, terms  of trade 
started a new decline, returning to the level prevalent at 2006. The deterioration of the terms of trade 
induced a sharp depreciation of real exchange rate (Figure 2)10. Due to the increase in the price of 
tradeable goods caused by exchange rate depreciation, real income per-worker started to decline from 
2014.Q3 (R$ 2422,00 to R$2209,00 in the 2015.Q3). 

4 – The effects on macroeconomic variables after shock in the Terms of Trade  

This section is dedicated to analyze the reaction functions in several macroeconomic variables 
of Brazilian economy, following a positive exogenous shock in terms of trade. The period of sample 
observations is 2003 to 2015, during the mandates of Presidents Lula (2003-2010) and Dilma (2011-
2015). Before the presentation of the results of the reactions functions, we adopted some statistical 
and econometric procedures, usually used when working with time series11, in order: (i) Correlation 
analysis between variables (4.1 topic) and Use of Temporal Multivariate Series (4.2 topic). 

4.1 - Multiple-Variable Analysis – Correlation Matrix 

Since we are interested in the relationship between two variables, more precisely, since we 
want  to  know  how  variation  of  one  affects  the  other,  by  a  shock  with  a  commanded  mechanism 
transmission in a model where there variable multipath by impulse function response of a multivariate 
model, we start from the bivariate correlation analysis to choose the variables to be inserted in the 
VAR. To multiple times series the familiar measure of dependence is the Pearson product-moment 
correlation coefficients between each of the random variables 𝑋i in the vector 𝑋′ =   [𝑋1 𝑋2 ⋯ 𝑋𝑛], 
𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋), is the matrix decomposition of the covariance matrix, Σ, which can be written:

the degree of correlation between variables (strong, moderate or weak), according to Table III.

10 The depreciation of real exchange rate occurred from 2005.Q2 on seemed to be more the result of the political crisis that erupted in 
Brazil after the beginning of President Dilma second term and the downgrade of Brazil by Rating Agencies in the 2015.Q3.

Table III –Degree of correlation between variables 

Correlations  were  calculated  on  32  samples  of  President  Lula  (2003-2010),  19  samples  of  
President Dilma (2011-2015) and 51 samples in the full period (2003-2015). All collected samples 
are quarterly order. Also in this context, some variables had to be calculated or even handled in such 
a way to adjust the database, namely the output gap, the domestic absorption, real interest rate and 
the  real  growth  rate.  The  usual  definition  of  the  output  gap  is  the  difference  between  the  product 
∗.  We  use  the  HP  filter 
(GDP)  logaritm,  𝑦𝑡,  and  the  product  potential  (potential  GDP)  logaritm,  𝑦𝑡
(Hodrick-Prescott 1997) and were calculated as the difference between the product and its trend: 

𝑥𝑡 = 𝑦𝑡 −   𝑦𝑡 

∗ ∴   𝑥𝑡 =   ∁𝑡 + 𝜃𝑡   (13) 

The  series  𝑥𝑡  is  made  up  of  a  trend  component,  denoted  by  𝜃  and  a  cyclical  component, 
denoted by ∁ such that in econometrics with disturb, 𝑥𝑡 =   ∁𝑡 + 𝜃𝑡 + 𝜖𝑡. For example, a positive value 
for the gap product can indicate the need raise the interest rate for contain demand pressures in the 
economy. The trend component that will solve minimizing the loss functions:

+ 𝜆. ∑[(𝜃𝑡+1 − 𝜃𝑡) −   (𝜃𝑡 − 𝜃𝑡−1) ]2

)  (14) 

𝑡=1

𝑑𝑡

𝑡=2

The  first  term  of  the  equation  is  the  sum  of  the  squared  deviations,  𝑑𝑡 = 𝑥𝑡 − 𝜃𝑡,  which 
penalizes the cyclical component. The second term is a multiple λ of the sum of the squares of the 
trend component's second differences. This second term penalizes variations in the growth rate of the 
trend component. The larger the value of λ the higher is the penalty. Hodrick-Prescott (1997) suggest 
λ =1600 as a value for quarterly data. And still T is the sample size. The variable domestic absorption, 
AD, was calculated as the difference between the gross domestic product at market price, GDPmp, 
and the net balance of exports of goods and services, NX: 

𝐴𝐷 = 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑚𝑝 − 𝑁𝑋  (15) 

We also calculate the real interest rate, r, using the following function: 

𝑟𝑡 = 100 ∗ {((𝑖𝑡 − 𝜋𝑡). (1 + 𝜋𝑡)−1) − 1}   (16) 

Where: 𝑖𝑡 is the nominal interest rate and 𝜋𝑡 is the inflation rate. For the nominal interest rate 
we use the accumulated SELIC interest in annualized month and the rate of inflation we use the Broad 
Consumer  Price  Index  (IPCA)  accumulated  in  12  months.  The  variable  real  growth  rate  of  gross 
domestic product accumulated in the last twelve months, %𝑃𝐼𝐵𝑟12𝑚𝑡, was calculated by deflating 
in terms of the accumulated IPCA in twelve months, 𝜋𝑡, as follows: 

%𝑃𝐼𝐵𝑟12𝑚𝑡 = 100 ∗ {(%𝑃𝐼𝐵12𝑚𝑡 − 𝜋𝑡). (1 + 𝜋𝑡)−1) − 1}   (17)

We divided the correlation analysis into three parts (Table IV): (i) government of President 

Lula (2003-2010); (ii) government of Dilma (2011-2015) and full period (2003-2015).  

 

Note: (i) Green: Positive Strong Correlation; (ii) Yellow: Moderate Positive Correlation; (iii) Grey: Low Correlation or not 
existent; (iv) Orange: Moderate Negative Correlation and (v) Red: Negative Strong Correlation. Source: Author´s own elaboration. 

Table IV – Correlations between terms of trade (TT) with other macroeconomic variables  

Based on the correlations we choose the endogenous variables inserted in the terms of trade 
model (TT) to dependence economy, where the shock will be given in terms of trade. The variables 
are: terms of trade (TT), Country risk premium (EMBIBR), Real Exchange Rate (TRC), Real Interest 
Rate (TRJ), gross fixed capital formation/GDP (GFCGGDP), Industrial GDP on GDP (GDPindGDP), 
Domestic  absorption(DA),  Output  gap  (GAP),  Public  Sector  Borrowing  Requirement  on  GDP 
(PSBRGDP), Real Labor Income(W), Unemployment(U), Inflation(IPCA). This is the starting order 
of the variables into VAR, chosen after the presentation of dependent economy model (Section 2). 

4.2 - Use of Temporal Multivariate Series 

We will use the methodology VAR to generate momentum (impulse or shocks) in terms of 
trade to observe the responses in the variables. For the empirical analysis we adopted the following 
in  order12:  (i)  specify  the  VAR  models  following  Sims-Stock-Watson(1990),  i.e.,  with  several 
variables in level, first differences or combinations of both, (ii) choose to lag optimal VAR(p) the 
criteria of Akaike (AIC), Final Prediction Error (FPE), Hannan-Quinn (HQ) and Schwarz (SC); (iii) 
estimate VAR models by Estimated Generalized Least Squares (EGLS) intercept, trend, restriction 
in coefficients via Top/Down method chosen by Akaike criteria; (iv) analyze the stability of VAR by 
eingelvalues  polynomial  reverse  feature;  (v)  make  the  structural  break  point  from  Chow  Forecast 
Test; (vi) make Cusum on each residual equation of the VAR, as Brown et al (1975); (vii) analyzing 
the  autocorrelation  of  residuals  through  the  auto-correlation  function  and  partial  auto-correlation, 
Portmanteau tests and Breusch (1978) and Godfrey (1978); (vii) analyze the normality of the residual 

                                                           
12 All these methods are described in Lukthepol (2005) and D’Agostini (2013).

The optimal lag order is chosen by minimizing one of the following information criteria for a 
range of lag orders n: Akaike (AIC), Final Prediction Error (FPE), Hannan-Quinn (HQ) e Schwarz 
(SC).  With  samples  of  the  2003.Q1  to  2015.Q3,  the  results  of  the  SC,  AIC,  FPE  and  HQ  tests, 
including  exogenous  variables  as  intercept,  trend  and  seasonal  dummyes  were  calculated,  always 
searched for one to ten lag. We can see the optimal criterion for lag selection for terms of trade model 
(TT model) is using the order of 3, 1 and 2 lags. The next step is to estimate the coefficients of the 
specifications proposed in TT Model, according with the optimal lags obtained, in this case 1 lag, but 
too 2 or 3 are used to convenience. To decrease the number of estimated parameters, we adopt the 
VAR  with  restrictions  on  the  coefficients,  said  VAR*  by  Estimator  Generalized  Least  Squares 
(EGLS) method and Top-Down procedure (TD), that chosen by Akaike criteria.  

After, we evaluate the stability of residues of each equation in the VAR. For strategy, began 
by analyzing the Kernel probability density function on residuals. Let (𝜇1, 𝜇2 , … , 𝜇𝑛) in each equation 
into VAR be an independent and identically distributed sample drawn from some distribution with 
an unknown density ƒ. The calculus of Kernel density estimator on residuals, 𝐾(𝜇), is: 

𝑓̂
ℎ(𝜇) ∴ 𝐾(𝜇) = 𝑛ℎ−1. ∑{𝐾(∗). [(𝜇 − 𝜇𝑖). ℎ−1]}

𝐾 is a non-negative function that integrates to one and has mean zero, and ℎ > 0 is a smoothing 
parameter called the bandwidth.  To illustrate the residual analysis (Figure 9), we take a simulated 
random sample from the standard normal distribution in the Kernel density, with h=0.05 at h=2.

We  observed  that  the  estimated  residuals  of  the  VAR  equations  have  similarities  with  the 
normal distribution (zero skewness and tree kurtosis). Some residues exhibit leptokurtic curves and 
others exhibit mesokurtics curves. Yet all residues exhibit some form of symmetry about zero. The 
next  step  is  to  perform  multivariate  normality  test  JB,  Jarque-Bera  (1987),  Lütkepohl  (1991)  and 
Doornik-Hansen (1994). The JB test is based on the third and fourth central moments of the standard 
normal distribution (skewness and kurtosis). The Lütkepohl tests and Doornik-Hansen show small 
systematic  deviations  of  skewness  and  kurtosis  observed  by  viewing  the  Gaussian  kernel  in  some 
residual, but do not reject the null hypothesis of multivariate normality of the residuals of the terms 
of trade model. As for the JB test, the results do not reject the null hypothesis of normality residual. 
One of the most important tests in the VAR model, when it incorporates stationary variables and non-
stationary, mixed way comments the article Sims Stock-Watson (1990), is to see if the set of equations 
of VAR has stability and consistent. The joint distribution of equations into VAR process is uniquely 
determined by the distributions 𝜇𝑡 process. The first and second time of VAR process, ie, the mean 
and covariance, are independent of time, therefore stationary and stable.  The VAR process is stable 
if the reverse characteristic polynomial has no roots inside the unit circle and the circle unit complex. 
Formally, this condition is given by: 

𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐼𝐾𝑝 − 𝐴. 𝑧) ≠ 0  ∴ 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐼𝐾 − 𝐴1. 𝑧 − 𝐴2. 𝑧2 − ⋯ − 𝐴𝑝. 𝑧𝑝) ≠ 0   (20) 
Where 𝐼𝐾 is  the identity matrix, A is the set  of matrix coefficients  and z is modulus of the 
eigenvalues of the reverse characteristic polynomial. We can filter VAR models eliminating those 
that have at least one value in module of eigenvalues of polynomial lower reverse feature that unit.

Finally, to check if VAR processes is stable we need to check the residual autocorrelation, as 
′ )=0 for 𝑠 ≠ 𝑡. In practice it is almost inevitable when there are several variables in 
in theory E(𝜇𝑡𝜇𝑠
the VAR system. However the use of optimum lag assists order to improve the problem of residual 
autocorrelation. Tests such as Portmanteau and Lagrange Multiplier Breusch-Godfrey Test13, help to 
determine whether, in general, there is residual autocorrelation in the VAR models. The Portmanteau 
test  and  Lagrange  Multipliers  Test  Breusch-Godfrey  has  the  null  hypothesis  not  residual 
′ =0, with 𝑠 = 𝑡 − 𝑖 and 𝑖 = 1,2, … , ℎ.The alternative hypothesis test is 
autocorrelation, 𝐻0 =E𝜇𝑡𝜇𝑡−𝑖
that at  least  one auto-covariance, and thus  a self-correlation  is  not  zero, showing auto-correlation. 
Using the Chi-Square distribution in both tests, with 5 % significance, both the Portmanteau test and 
Breusch- Godfrey test does not reject the null hypothesis of no residual autocorrelation.  

In this sense residual CUSUM tests and parameters constancy Chow tests were used to verify 
the parameter constancy. To test this, the  Figure  10  presents the Chow test  results14 for structural 
break in the last years of multivariate temporal series into VAR model. The dotted line show the p-
values with 5% and 10% of significance. The null hypothesis of constant parameters, including the 
residual covariance matrix,∑ ,𝑢  is rejected between 2012 and 2013 and strongly in 2015, government 
mandate of Dilma (see the section 2 to details of this moment). Replicating CUSUM stability test on 
residuals  proposed  by  Brown  et  al  (1975)  in  the  terms  of  trade  model,  over  the  past  years  (2009-
2015), the results observed indicate stability on VAR process, with 5% significance.

The total cumulative effects of impulses in the residuals, 𝑢𝑡’s, were obtained by addition of 
appropriate coefficients of Impulse Response Function (IRF). The responses, which generate a shock 
in terms of trade, can be observed in the Figure 11. As we can see a positive shock in Terms of Trade 
is associated with a permanent decrease in the sovereign risk premium measures by EMBI+, in the 
investment  rate,  industrial  GDP  on  GDP,  unemployment  rate  and  inflation.  Real  exchange  rate 
appreciates in first instance, and then depreciates.

Figure 11: Accumulated Responses in the variables after Impulse in the terms of trade (TT) 

The change from a good to a poor macroeconomic performance in Brazil after 2013 can be 
partially explained by the combined effects of a negative shock in terms of trade and a positive shock 
in domestic absorption due to the trend increase in primary expenditures to GDP. But these factors 
do not seem to be enough to explain the magnitude of the fall in GDP occurred in 2015. As we saw 
in figure 10 there is econometric evidence of structural break in the econometric model in 2012, 2013 
and, more strongly, in 2015. This structural break may be caused by the increased in the perception 
of uncertainty due to the recent Brazilian political crisis and the empirical evidence on Brazilian case 
about terms of trade and real exchange rate over-valuation. 

5 – Final Remarks 

What factors explain this collapse of Brazilian macroeconomic performance after 2014? We 
had that due to exchange rate over-valuation caused by the improvement in Terms of Trade, Brazilian 
economy  had  experienced  some  structural  negative  changes  like  de-industrialization  and  re-
primarization of exports that reduced its long-run growth  potential. These structural  changes were 
sufficient to explain a situation of near stagnation that Brazil experienced in the period 2011-2013; 
but  are incapable  for its  own to  produce  a deep  recession  as the one seen in  2015. A recession is 
always  and  elsewhere  caused  by  insufficient  effective  demand,  so  in  order  to  explain  why  Brazil 
entered in a deep recession we have to understand what factors caused a fall of aggregate demand at 
the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015. The first cause of the contraction of aggregate demand was 
the reduction of investment rate. As we can see in figure 3 below, investment had fallen from 20.92% 
of GDP in the first quarter of 2014 to 18.12% of GDP in the third quarter of 2015, a fall of 2.80% of 
GDP in less than two years.  This contraction of investment demand is for sure the result of ROE 
falling below the safe rate of interest after 2012 as we had seen in last section, i.e. a result of a profit 
squeeze. Besides that, the public scandal originated by police investigations of corruption (the so-
called  “operação  lava-jato”)  at  PETROBRAS  had  provoked  a  major  political  crisis  with  a  serious 
threat of impeachment of President Dilma Rouseff. This crisis had also a clear and negative (but until 
now  not  quantified)  effect  over  investment  expenditures  of  private  sector  since  it  increased  the 
perceived uncertainty in economic environment. Finally, the deterioration in terms of trade had also 
a negative effect over profitability of investment projects of the mining industry (oil and iron ore), 
which become increasing important in Brazil during the commodity boom. The second cause was the 
huge contraction of real income per-worker since the beginning of 2015. As we can see in figure 2, 
in the first semester of 2015 real income per-worker started to fall at a very fast rate, with the expected 
effects over consumption expenditures. The fall in real income per-worker was the result of inflation 
acceleration occurred in 2015 combined with the increasing in the rate of unemployment (Figure 3). 
To sum-up, a combination of change in international economic environment, delayed effects of errors

in  the  conduction  of  economic  policy,  profit  squeeze  and  a  major  political  crisis  had  created  the 
scenario of a perfect storm, generating a huge contraction of aggregate demand that reduced growth 
below potential. Since potential growth was reduced due to negative structural changes that Brazilian 
economy faced as a consequence of exchange rate over-valuation, the result was a deep recession, 
probably the deepest that occurred in Brazil since the end of Second World War. The positive side of 
this scenario is that real exchange rate seemed to return to a competitive level in the second semester 
of 2015. Indeed, nominal exchange rate had experienced a huge depreciation due to the combined 
effects of deterioration of terms of trade and uncertainty created by the political crisis in Brazil. From 
July of 2014 to July of 2015, nominal exchange rate had devaluated in 49,7%, reaching a value near 
R$ 3,40 in the beginning of august. If we consider the industrial equilibrium exchange rate (Bresser-
Pereira, Oreiro and Marconi (2014) and Marconi, 2012)) as the adequate measure for a competitive 
exchange rate. This means that exchange rate adjustment is done, which can give a start in a possible 
re-industrialization of Brazilian economy.
