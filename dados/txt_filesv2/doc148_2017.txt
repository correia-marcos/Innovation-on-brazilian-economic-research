Abstract

The recent period have present diﬃculties to predict sources of risk in Brazil. The objective
of this article was to analyze the spillover eﬀects and channels of volatility from and
to Brazilian stock market (Bovespa) in the period that goes from 2014 to 2016. In this
period, is marked as one of the most volatile periods since the subprime crisis. A political
and economic crisis, followed by federal police investigation combined with a period of
slow economic growth in the world, downtrend in commodities prices and unconventional
monetary policies in the world, makes the task to identify the sources of price risk dubious.
Using a MGARCH-BEKK, DCC and t-Copulas modelling, the main results of the article
suggest US monetary policy and rebalancing of portfolios generates volatility to Brazil.
However, Bovespa also generates volatility to commodity markets and US bonds market.
This is explained by the role that Brazil plays as mediator of these markets when allocators
diversify their positions with Latin America and in commodities. In this regard, Policy
Makers must observe portfolio rebalancing and its consequences to risk spreading before
implementing economic policies.

1 Introduction

In his seminal work about volatility transmission, Engle, Ito e Lin (1988) explains
the volatility process lies in an agile reaction to a contemporary information or in a sluggish
information pricing by the market. Particularly, in Brazil, the period between 2014 and 2016,
marked Brazilian ﬁnancial Market as one of the most volatile periods since the subprime crisis.
A political crisis, combined with the federal police investigation – called in a free translation as
“Car Wash”-, and geopolitical events as the BREXIT, expectations about monetary policy and
presidential elections in USA generated volatility on markets.

In the middle of this turbulence of information, it is diﬃcult for portfolio managers
to discern the relevant news. While most analysts attributed to politics the performance of
the stock market index, Vladimir Signorelli in Rapazza (2016) says that investors are not
interpreting Brazilian market well. The commodities were pushing Bovespa up to him. The
Figure 1 in section 5 shows the relationship of GDP, commodities and stock markets.

A correct understanding about the co-dependence between markets is critical to portfolio
performance and to policy makers interventions. The causes and consequences from Macro-
prudential Policies lies in implement the correct variables in models. A correct measurement of
correlation is used as input in diversiﬁcated portfolios. On the other hand, recent crisis revealed
the importance of the interdependence between ﬁnancial institutions and markets to systemic
risk (see Ibragimov, Jaﬀee e Walden (2011)).

Additionally, the technology advances in trading provides agility and easier access to
international markets to traders. Consequently, strategies of international diversiﬁcation, and
arbitrage opportunities, are easier to implement. Solnik (1995) suggest that internationally
diversiﬁcate portfolios perform better than domestically ones. Of course, as Markowitz (1952)
formalized in his seminal work, the low correlation between assets reduces risk while improves
return. However,Longin e Solnik (1995) shows that the correlation between countries tend to
variate in time, and to become higher in level, as well.

In a highly-integrated world, both in an economical and a ﬁnancial perspective, issues
about temporal cross dependence of assets return gain importance. The recent literature
recognizes the existence of ﬁnancial co-volatility movements. Particularly, considering these
features, they have the potential to carry out the best decisions of hedging, portfolio selection,
pricing of assets and derivatives, and market risk management Bauwens, Laurent e Rombouts
(2006). Engle (1982) pioneered the development in ﬁnancial econometrics risk measures, that
in advance allow to solve problems of aggregation of risk. Developing multivariate models as
MGARCH, CCC, DCC or models with ﬂexibilizations of normally distributed returns as copulas
1.

As noted by Bekaert, Hodrick e Zhang (2009), co-volatilities have received too much
attention because of the highly-correlated risk that marked crises in emerging markets. These
structural breaks in correlation patterns are termed as contagion. A profound discussion about
this survey can be ﬁnd in Calvo e Reinhart (1996);Dornbusch, Park e Claessens (2000);Forbes e
Rigobon (2002); Marçal e Pereira (2009).

This article deals with well-known and expected eﬀect of interdependence that occur
between markets in periods of stability, as referred by Forbes e Rigobon (2002). The transmission
of volatility in Brazil might occur, ﬁrst in pathway channels that institutional investors (pensions
funds, hedge funds) creates to gain exposure on commodities markets throughout Brazilian
companies (such Vale and Petrobras) or other emerging markets highly correlated with Brazil,
1 Patton (2009)presents a broad discussion about using Copula functions when modelling ﬁnancial times series,

and their desirable density distribution assumptions to risk modelling.

but with less liquidity. In this regard, Cardona, Gutiérrez e Agudelo (2017) attest to the
leadership role played by capital market of Brazil in Latin America.

A second motive to spillover of risk occur, relates to portfolio allocators pursuing emerging
market shares to balance their risk and return strategies. Of course, it cannot be ignored the
existence of herd behavior in markets, that drives mainly contagion eﬀect, but also, spillover of
risk. The literature that understand the channels and what generates capital ﬂow is too wide to
survey here, a profound analysis can be found in Bonizzi (2016), Froot e Donohue (2002), and
Hsieh et al. (2011).

The seminal paper of Engle, Ito e Lin (1988), stablished transmission eﬀects in comparison
with market eﬃciency. Modelling Yen/USD, to a wide group of markets, they tested the
hypothesis of Heat Waves and Meteor Shower. The ﬁrst relates to the fundamentals of an
economy, which must not widespread to other markets. In contrast, the Meteor Shower hypothesis
proposes the tendency of less eﬃcient markets to widespread information. The recent literature
on transmission eﬀects still is concerned with the impact of events in economic variables, or
about the identiﬁcation of factors that spread waves of risk among existing channels and with
the contagion eﬀect in times of crisis, as well.

Ahmadi, Behmiri e Manera (2016) investigates the eﬀects of diﬀerent oil-related shocks
on the volatility of agricultural prices using a Vector Autorregressive (VAR) model. The main
results suggest a signiﬁcant impact of oil volatility in agricultural markets. Baldi, Peri e Vandone
(2016) additionally uses a GARCH-BEKK model to identify transmission eﬀects between SP500
and commodities market, ﬁnding a negative relationship in transmission eﬀects. Beckmann
e Czudaj (2014) adopts a diﬀerent approach; using future markets they ﬁnd out a spillover
eﬀect within commodity prices. Gozgor, Lau e Bilgin (2016) broadens the precedent literature
by trying to measure the role of uncertainty and risk perceptions on commodity’s volatility.
However, the eﬀects of risk perception and uncertainty are statistically robust just for few
products.

Particularly, oil plays a leadership role in world’s economic activity. Broadstock, Cao e
Zhang (2012) in a fama-french three factor model, oil prices changes can be interpreted as a
systemic risk to related stocks from Chinese energy sector. In Broadstock e Filis (2014), the
authors disentangled oil-prices into speciﬁc shock series (supply, demand, aggregate demand)
and add US stock market. This approach is important to understand the existence of asymmetric
speciﬁc shock responses depending on economic signals and sectors. Boldanov, Degiannakis e
Filis (2016) expands the analysis to discern shocks in oil-exporting and oil-importing countries.
Supply side shocks tend to aﬀect both countries diﬀerently, whereas demand side tend to aﬀect
all countries positively.

The versatility of the Multivariate GARCH models is used to analyze the vulnerability
that countries face about regional or global shocks. Alotaibi e Mishra (2015) studies the eﬀects
of volatility spillovers from regional and global factors over GCC stock markets attesting
an asymmetry of responses. Cardona, Gutiérrez e Agudelo (2017) tested the hypothesis of
decoupling between United States and Latin American Countries – such as Mexico, Brazil, Chile,
Peru, Colombia, Argentina. They used a Multivariate GARCH-BEKK model to averiguate the
spillover relationships between these markets. The aftermath of the study suggests that Brazil
have a leadership role on the region since it transmits volatility to other countries. Additionally,
the country is the only one to transmit volatility to the United States. However, the results do
not provide support to the ﬁnancial decoupling hypothesis though.

Liu, Hammoudeh e Thompson (2013) and Hammoudeh et al. (2013) disentangle economic,
ﬁnancial and political risk on BRICS countries. Using a MTAR and an ADRL framework they
try to measure the transmission of risk by these factors.

3

A few works focusing on Brazil’s markets movements using MGARCH models can be
found. Using DCC and GARCH-BEKK models, Chaine (2011) tested the spillover eﬀect from
the S&P500 on the Bovespa index, along the subprime crisis. The hypothesis of transmission is
attested, suggesting that during the crisis co-movement is highly positively correlated. Righi
e Ceretta (2013) splits the sample in before, during and after the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008 to
evaluate the transmission eﬀect on Brazil’s stock market. The results are illustrative as they
reveal that Brazil index started to inﬂuence other indexes during the crisis, and after the crisis,
its market emerged as more integrated to the world. Ferreira et al. (2012) analyzes the contagion
eﬀect on the same period under sectorial indexes, ﬁnding evidences of a rising co-volatilities,
aﬀecting mainly the real estate and ﬁnancial sectors.

The stylized fact about non-normality of distributions in ﬁnancial series is a motivation
to use a more appealing modelling about this fact. Lee e Long (2009) proposes the use of a
Copulas function modelling Multivariate GARCH models such DCC, BEKK and VC. Another
approach in this sense is proposed by Christoﬀersen et al. (2011), that uses copula allowing to
asymmetries and tail dependence combined with DCC and DECO models.

Empirical studies applied to Brazil that we had access test the interdependencies in
periods of crisis. Therefore, they ﬁt better to Forbes e Rigobon (2002) deﬁnition of contagion
eﬀects, instead of transmission eﬀect. Barroso, Silva e Sales (2016) attempt to provide evidence
of a portfolio rebalancing eﬀect due to unconventional monetary policies in US. To attest the
eﬀects of Quantitative Easing on capital inﬂows in Brazil, the authors built a counterfactual
exercise. Their detailed analysis conﬁrmed some intuitions about spillover eﬀects from US
monetary policy. Capital inﬂows led to exchange rate appreciation, stock market boom, and
credit growth. Moreover, the results are as revealing as enlightening to the eﬀects of capital
ﬂows to economic variables in Brazil.

The objective of this article is to analyze and identify the transmission eﬀects and
channels of volatility from and to Brazilian stock market. The hypothesis tested here is the
existence of these channels because of: i) Brazil is a mediator of perturbance and volatility of
commodities (metals, energy, and agricultural) and Latin American markets; ii) The volatility of
ﬁnancial market in Brazil is highly dependent of international disturbances (politic, geopolitics,
economic); iii) The fundamentals of the Brazilian economy explain by themselves the volatility in
stock markets. The methodology chosen to test the transmission of volatility to Brazil is based on
Cardona, Gutiérrez e Agudelo (2017), that uses a bivariate and a trivariate GARCH-BEKK and
the estimation is based on Lütkepohl (2005) and Tsay (2013). Even though these models present
diﬃculties to encounter signiﬁcant parameters, their outcomes are intuitive and objective.

The diﬃculty to disentangle the sources of shocks is evident in the literature review, it
intensiﬁes in a country with political and ﬁscal instability as Brazil in this period. This factors
shed light on the need to clarify the right channels of risk to the ﬁnancial market in Brazil.
Portfolio managers and Policy Makers (see Barroso et al. (2014)) interventions decisions to
control systemic risk, can directly be beneﬁted by exercises like this. Moreover, the lack of
empirical applications focusing on Brazil highlights the contribution of this article.

Besides this introduction, this paper is organized in four additional sections. The next
present the data main features. The third section discusses the methodology applied, followed
by the fourth that presents and discusses the results. Finally, the ﬁfth section is the conclusion.

The agricultural commodities are justiﬁed due the close relationship they have with
economic activity in Brazil (see Figure 1). The American stock index and 10 years bonds, are
used to analyze rebalancing eﬀects due to unconventional monetary policies there. Exist evidence
they cause rearrangement of carry trade portfolios around the world (GUNES, 2012). Credit
Default Swaps (CDS) became known after the ﬁnancial crisis, as a source of security to default
of debt in Brazil, have been mostly used by analysts and academia as country risk indicator.
The descriptive statistics shows that some series present outliers, as US Bonds and
Iron. The test of normality rejects the null hypothesis of normality to almost all the series.
Additionnaly, is possible to identify that the agricultural commodities market has a more
disperse distribution than the metals and ﬁnancials. The excess of kurtosis diﬀerent from zero
suggests the adequacy of these series to a conditional heteroscedasticity modelling.

The political crisis in Brazil was one of the major features of the period of this study.
In some way, have driven prices on ﬁnancial markets due expectations relating conduction
of economic policy. Moreover, the presidential election in 2014 was cutthroat, it expanded
uncertainty and disturbed investor’s portfolios.

In fact, is possible to observe on Figure 1 the uptrend since 2014, followed by a reversal
movement that marks Brazilian stock market’s phase of downtrend. Amorim (2016) highlights
that the presidential election generated a polarized dispute between the candidate of Social
Democratic Party (PSDB) Aécio Neves and the representant of Labor Party (PT) Dilma Rousseﬀ.
The expectations of a possible election of the ﬁrst forced at that time a raising tendency of
stock markets’ prices until 2015. This pressure of buyers became known in a free translation as
“bull election’s market”.

Afterwards, in 2015, the political climate worsens. As Globo (2014) pointed the elected
president Dilma Rousseﬀ peddled a lie on society when she changed all the economic team
and pivoted to an austerity economic policy – meanwhile her proposals were about more ﬁscal
expansion policies. Moreover, Almeida e Salto (2016) explain that is in this period that the
problems about public debt becomes explicit. In the same period, the stock market’s prices of
the companies became more volatile.

August of the same year, the govern delivered to congress the budget of the next year in

5

a deﬁcit situation. This event is sparkled as the ﬁrst time on the history of the country (GLOBO,
2015). It reinforces the ﬁscal problems that the country faces, what motivates a downgrade on
credit rating by risk agencies Standard and Poor’s and Fitch. Finally, at end of the year the
leader of the government went to jail as suspect of bribery.

Nevertheless, this context conjectures a political crisis with consequences on Bovespa’s
(brazilizan stock exchange) volatility. Once an impeachment, in the prevailing political system
in Brazil could solve the crisis (ABRANCHES, 1988). Just the raising probability of these event
resulted in a bull market in Brazil. However, at the same period the international environment
enhanced beginning an uptrend as well. Is possible to note when observing the trend of prices
of Brent Oil, S&P500 index and the other commodities1. The high correlation between them
is explained by the highly dependence of Brazil of exports of primary products and due the
dynamic of trading of certain commodities as oil and iron. Speculators and investors might prefer
to reduce costs of trading by buy and sell ﬁnancial products of companies highly associated with
its markets as Vale and Petrobras. Its worsen analysis of portfolio managers making diﬃcult to
discern correlation from causality.

3 Methodology

Since Markowitz (1952), the analysis of risk is based on statistical measures. Sharpe
(1964), Lintner (1965) and Mossin (1966) relativized in a linear relationship the notion of risk
with the Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM). Problems of adherence to data experienced
by this models motivated Ross (1976) to propose Arbitrage Price Theory (APT) to increase
robustness of beta as measure of exposure to systemic risk.

However, Mandelbrot (1963) notes the misbehaving of models of risk measurement
due to the inconsistency between the assumption of normally distributed returns and real
world ﬁnancial returns behavior. Financial times series tend to cluster, a problem solved by
modelling the conditional heteroscedasticity. Proposed by Engle (1982) with the Autorregressive
Conditional Heteroscedasticiy(ARCH) model. Bollerslev (1986) proposed a generalization with
the Generalized ARCH(GARCH), pioneering a set of extensions trying to capture leverage eﬀect
of ﬁnancial time series.

Moreover, as Cardona, Gutiérrez e Agudelo (2017) suggest, the aftermath of ﬁnancial
crisis led scholars to propose models allowing to predict idiosyncratic risk and their eﬀects on
other markets. Additionally, portfolio managers must base their decisions of allocation on cross-
assets eﬀects (DANÍELSSON, 2011). Policy makers must feed up their macroeconometric models
with the interdependence between economic variable before taking a decision, as well. Although
valuable, the positive deﬁniteness and the excess of parameters generated by a multivariate
model, requires imposing some restrictions (FRANCQ; ZAKOIAN, 2011).

Among them, the most direct generalization is the VEC Model proposed in Bollerslev,
Engle e Wooldridge (1988) 2. The literature that comes after, state forms to solve the problem
of overparameterizations of VEC speciﬁcation. A model relying on univariate GARCH is
In the appendix, the ﬁgure 1 shows the relationship between economic activity in Brazil, its Stocks and
1
commodities.

2 Even though it assumes a multivariate form, its interpretations are closely related to univariate GARCH

models. Supposing a VEC(1,1):

ht = c + Aηt−1 + Ght−1

where ηt−1 and Ght−1 can be stacked by an operator vec(.) to become a vector. A and G are squared
parameter matrices and c is a vector.

the Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) Bollerslev (1990), an extension is the Dynamic
Conditional Correlation(DCC) model proposed in Engle (2002) and Tse e Tsui (2002).

As Tsay (2013) stablish, the DCC is used modelling the conditional correlation matrix

ρ = D−1

t

D−1

t

, Dt = diag(σii,t)

(1)

t

Dt is the diagonal of the variance-covariance matrix at time t. The model uses marginal
volatility series to extract the conditional correlation matrix of them. Supposing ηt = (η1t,··· ,
ηkt)‘ as the standardized innovation vector. In this regard, pt is the volatility matrix of ηt. The
model proposed by Engle (2002), diﬀers from Tse e Tsui (2002) because instead of assuming the
past correlation information just as feeding the model output, it considers the ηt.

Following the approach in Tsay (2013), is used a Copula function (C) to provide a better
understanding about the dependence structure of the joint distribution of this variables. This is
justiﬁed to empirical evidences suggesting the dependence structure between asset returns as
being non-normal(PATTON, 2006).

The Copula links together marginal distribution functions to form joint distribution
functions. Supposing a vector random variable X = [X1, X2,··· , Xn]‘, with distributions
F1, F2,··· , Fn. Their joint distribution function F (PATTON, 2009). It can be easily understood
using the Sklar (1959) theorem:

F(x) = C(F1(x1), F2(x2),··· , Fn(Xn),∀x ∈ Rn

(2)
Thus, a multidimensional distribution is represented by the product of n univariate
distributions and a copula function. As pointed by Patton (2009), extracting the marginal
distributions from a multivariate function, is very useful for time series modelling, because the
Copula function (C) does not requires the same distribution of all variables to extract information
from the model. Additionally, when dealing with ﬁnancial times series, the non-normality of
them is a stylized fact. Therefore, this is an advantage when the shape and the adherence of
the data is the main interest of the model. In this study, will be used a t-Copula function as
suggested by Tsay (2013). Using the model based in Creal, Koopman e Lucas (2013) to describe
the conditional volatilities and correlations in a manner analogous to a DCC model.

Another approach used in the literature to relax the tight conditions of VEC speciﬁcation
is the BEKK model. Engle e Kroner (1995) proposed a new parametrization for ht that imposes
it to take a positive semi-deﬁnite form. In other words, the BEKK model is an speciﬁc case of a
VEC model 3. To our application here, the use of this model will be important to understand
the direction of the ﬂow of shocks and volatilities the GARCH-BEKK model is appealing and
intuitive, even though it presents some diﬃculties of estimation.Resende (2015) proves that a
stochastic sequence of a variable X = (t)t∈N is a GARCH-BEKK model if:

Francq e Zakoian (2011) deﬁnes this relation as a strong GARCH process. Where K is
an integer, Ω, Aik and Bjk are square mxm matrices, and ω is positive deﬁnite; ηt is an i.i.d
sequence. The speciﬁcation ensures positive deﬁnites to Ht.
3

In applications, it is more used due the reduction of the number of parameters. Engle e Kroner (1995) proves
that the restrictions atributed on BEKK parameters, can easily be equivalent to a vech(.) form.

This model becomes more parsimonious than a vec speciﬁcation as it economizes on
parameters (ENGLE; KRONER, 1995). As stated by (TSAY, 2013), even though the framework
provided by the BEKK model produces some positive-deﬁnite volatility matrices and attractive
representations. It has problems of application, whereas their parameter are constantly non-
signiﬁcant at 5% level. To encounter a good estimation, the model should be used at maximum
three variables.

The process of estimation of the MGARCH-BEKK model in this article will follow
Cardona, Gutiérrez e Agudelo (2017) proposal, and the approach of (LÜTKEPOHL, 2005) and
(TSAY, 2013). 4 The algorithm used is as follows. First, we encounter the stationary series
applying the tests of unit root as Dickey-Fuller, Phillips Perron, and KPSS. Then, the series are
grouped in pairs with the Bovespa, and the estimation process will follow the CRAN Package

smoothing the covariance returns of the series using a Vector Autorregressive (VAR) model.
Then, their residuals are ﬁtted to capture the conditional heteroscedastic process in a univariate
GARCH model. Finally, these uncorrelated residuals will be used as input of a DCC and
t-copulas process, to capture the cross-dependence of this series. described in this section.

Thereafter, the Portmanteau Test select the models considered to analysis. Table 6 in
the appendix provides the test results of all Bivariate estimation done. This rigorous treatment
with the residuals of this series is justiﬁed because it will be followed by a structural analysis.
The ARCH parameter will be interpreted as a shock or a perturbance in the cross relation of
the series. Whereas the GARCH term represents the volatility transmitted to the other country.
The direction of this process is determined by the position of the coeﬃcients, the magnitude

4 Results

However, is of interest from Policy Makers and Portfolio Managers a correct measurement
of correlation risk. Correlation is an importante input when applying diversiﬁcation principle.
Moreover, recent crisis revealed the importance of the interdependence between ﬁnancial
institutions and markets to systemic risk (see Ibragimov, Jaﬀee e Walden (2011)).

4.1 Dynamic Correlation

A preliminary analysis on tables 3, 3 and 4 shows that in average, the most volatile
Variable is the CDS(58%), followed by Brent(38%), US treasury Bonds(36%) and Iron(29%).
The ﬁrst diﬀers from others because is a derivative. However, all of them are important variables
to Brazilian stock market. Reﬂecting monetary policy, world’s economic activity and, political
and default uncertainty in Brazil.

considering the t-Copulas. Whereas the second presents a negative correlation with the stock
market index.

These results are important because is expected that the US stock market aﬀects the
Brazil(BR) stock market, directly or indirectly. As referred in the introduction section 1,
important money ﬂow channels are encountered in portfolio balancing due unconventional
monetary policies in US (see Barroso, Silva e Sales (2016). In the following sections this results
become clear.

Another important result is that the average dynamic correlation with the stock market
in Brazil is low. Suggesting a good potential of diversiﬁcation among markets in this time span,
as well as, the Bovespa presents low vulnerability to commodities market. In the ﬁgure 4, is
possible to note that the agricultural commodities are in a downtrend of correlation in the
mid-term. Moreover, especially in high volatile variables(Brent and CDS), the correlation is
more unstable on time.

Comparing the diﬀerent models, whereas that in average correlation, the t-Copulas
model is more volatile than the DCC’s. Intuitively, this model considers in a higher precision,
tail movements in the joint distribution of the series.

Summing up, dynamic correlation between Bovespa and the variables of this study are
low to almost all of them. Just Bonds and S&P500 have relatively higher correlation. However,
some series, such Brent Oil and CDS have a more unstable relation with brazilian stock. This
can be noted in Figure 4, mainly when t-copulas - DCC is considered 5.

4.2 Bivariate Risk Transmission Analysis

Table shows the main results found in the estimation of a Bivariate GARCH-BEKK. In
the agricultural group of commodities, just soybeans lasts. Sugar, corn and ethanol did not ﬁt
well in the model, presenting serial autocorrelation. Therefore, they were excluded of the part
of the bivariate estimation.

A structural analysis in the table 3 estimation, given the signiﬁcance of the param-
eters, reveals that gold, iron ore, brent oil and US long term bonds cause a perturbance to
Bovespa, without persistence. Meanwhile, Brazil’s index does not aﬀect other variables. The
5 This experiment with a Copulas function might suggest the existence of some dependence behavior, more
proeminent on tails, that might be important to explain transmission between these markets. However, is
just a sign, and deeper analysis is needed.

interdependence in volatility generates a bidirectional channel with monetary policies in US,
and unidirectional from copper, iron and gold and to soy.

The use copper, as a main input in many real state business in China, and in the
production of electronics, is recently highly associated with the economic activity in the world.
This justiﬁes the eﬀects of copper on Brazil. The results of Gold suggest as it is a precious metal
used mainly as reserve of value by investors in a kind of ﬂight to security, that the movements
of gold that aﬀect the Bovespa are related to risk aversion behavior, not implying a problem in
the fundamentals of the economy. Extreme events tend to increase volatility of Gold, what per
se aﬀect the willingness by allocators to rebalancing their portfolio. These kinds of events tend
to have less persistence (ENGLE; ITO; LIN, 1988).

Extending the ﬁndings of Barroso, Silva e Sales (2016), where unconventional monetary
policies in US leads to an exchange rates appreciation, stock market’s boom and credit growth.
Whereas he suggests the existence of strong propagation channels based on inﬂow of excess
monetary supply from US to Brazil, the analysis here reinforce this channel as a path of risk
spreading to stock’s markets. In this regard, there is a portfolio rebalancing implication in carry
trade portfolios because there is a wealth eﬀect on the economy given the Quatitative Easing
(QE) policy. However, as Gunes (2012) propose, ‘fear factors’ incorporated on the Volatility
Index (VIX), have strong implications in carry trade balancing.

The results found with iron ore, brent oil and none relationship with SP500 is not
consistent to what is expected to capital market in Brazil. In part, it contradicts the results
found in Righi e Ceretta (2013), where before the subprime crises in 2008, S&P 500 generated
volatility to Brazil, and after the crisis, the transmission becomes bidirectional. Chaine (2011)
reinforces that Brazil was decoupling from US stock markets, but the crisis reversed this trend.
Ferreira et al. (2012) goes further, identifying that real state sector pursued a bidirectional
relationship of risk with US Stock Market.

The Bovespa index is mainly constituted by metals companies such CSN and Vale, a big
player in the oil market as Petrobras and some banking companies. Thus, the signiﬁcance of
these commodities is expected. Might exist some limitations in a bivariate analysis, whereas it
does not consider arbitrage eﬀects among stocks exchange along the world. Diﬀerent markets
closing and opening are suﬃcient to traders seek opportunities generated by the same news
in diﬀerent stock exchanges. In his seminal work, Engle, Ito e Lin (1988) has an intuitive
illustration about this:

"[...]when the monetary supply statistics are announced in the market in New
York at 4:10pm of Thursday, there are less than thirty minutes to trade actively
in New York. If all traders do not share the common belief about the meaning of
the announced money supply, then it takes a few hours of actual trading to settle
the diﬀerence in traders’ priors. [...]some types of technical analysis behavior could
have this characteristic. Suppose that there was a large yen appreciation in the
Tokyo maket. If the shock creates the expectation of more appreciation , then the
speculation may take place in the European markets of the same day and not wait
until the Tokyo market of the next day" (ENGLE; ITO; LIN, 1988, p. 5).

This article also intends to test the channel of investment ﬂows due to costs reduction –
invest in a pathway created by the high correlation of Petrobras and Vale with such commodities.
To accomplish this objective, the analysis will be expanded to a trivariate model, following
Cardona, Gutiérrez e Agudelo (2017). Being: i) Bovespa, Brent Oil, and Petrobras; ii) Bovespa,
Iron Ore, SP500; iii) Bovespa, SP500 and BR Bonds 10y.

4.3 Trivariate Risk Transmission Analysis

In contrast with bivariate models, the parameter of trivariate of the relationships arised
as dubious when treated in a direct manner. The ﬁrst insightful result is that the perturbance
from Bovespa to Brent Oil becomes signiﬁcant when Petrobras is introduced. Even though the
eﬀect of Oil on stock market is stronger (0.085vs − 0.037), what suggests that Bovespa plays
an indirect role on the oil market. This conclusion is reinforced by the dynamic assumed by
Petrobras and Brent Oil. While Brent oil causes shocks on Petrobras, the persistence waves
of risk are spread to oil market by Petrobras. This result deserves further study, because the
company does not play just the role of a big state oil company, but, recently have been target
of investigations about corruption. In some way, Petrobras is today a proxy of political stability
in Brazil. Furthermore, a more profound understanding about the interdependence between
oil companies around the world in a scenario of low oil price – EBITDA margins are harder to
obtain.

A similar eﬀect is found in the interconnection between Vale and Iron Ore market
given by the signiﬁcance of the parameters. Observing the vector containing SP500, Iron Ore
and Bovespa, both indexes become relevant to explain codependences in the Iron Ore market.
Additionally, Brazil’s index appears to have more vulnerability to disturbances of the commodity.
This interdependence becomes even more stronger when considering the vector of Bovespa, Iron
Ore, and Vale. Bovespa plays a bidirectional role with Iron Ore (−0.0190vs0.1181 respectively).
The intuition is that the index act as mediator in the transmission eﬀect to Vale, as the company
has a persistence of covolatility caused by the commodity.

All these results emphasize the ﬁrst channel of risk spreading proposed in this article.
Bovespa serves as pathway throughout fund managers open and close positions on commodities.
A diﬀerent perspective to the position of the Brazil in the international ﬁnancial market system
is when it plays a role of a negatively correlated asset to portfolio allocators. Solnik (1995)
proposed the beneﬁts that managers could accomplish in this approach and Gunes (2012) the
implication of these news to carry trade portfolios. The intuitive interpretation when observing
the connections between Bovespa, SP500 and US treasury bonds, diﬀerently than the bivariate
analysis, now the relation between SP500 and Bovespa is signiﬁcant with a unidirectional eﬀect
from SP500. Additionally, the US treasury bonds tend to aﬀect Bovespa, in both generating
perturbance and volatility. This results are aligned with the recent literature about portfolio
and of capital ﬂow.

Barroso et al. (2013) and Barroso, Silva e Sales (2016) suggested that QE policies aﬀects
portfolio rebalancing, generating ﬂow of capital to Brazil. Bonizzi (2016) attested the eagerness
of international investors for risk-return balancing. Gunes (2012) shed lights on the importance
waves of risk in a carry trade portfolio. All these arguments reinforce the result found about
transmissions channel between US bonds and stock markets and Brazil’s stock market due
portfolio rebalancing.

5 Conclusion

The objective of this article was to analyze the transmission eﬀects and channels of
volatility from and to Brazilian stock market. The hypothesis tested here is the existence of
these channels because of: i) Brazil plays a role of mediator of perturbance and volatility of
commodities (metals, energy, and agricultural) and Latin American markets such presented in
Cardona, Gutiérrez e Agudelo (2017) ; ii) The volatility of ﬁnancial market in Brazil is highly
dependent of international disturbances (politic, geopolitics, economic); iii) The fundamentals
of the Brazilian economy explain by themselves the volatility in stock markets.

The dynamic correlation models suggest that just US stock markets and Brazil trea-
sury bonds are highly correlated (positive and negative respectively) with Brazil stock index.
Commodities in general are low correlated with Bovespa, and the agricultural ones have a
downtrend association with the index.The empirical results suggest that the stock market in
Brazil is strongly aﬀected by monetary policies noises from US, and world economic activity.
Additionally, receives shocks of risk due risk aversion moves. In the trivariate analysis, the
evidences imply that Brazil is a mediator of waves of volatility, to and from Brent Oil, Iron Ore
and US treasury Bonds.

The literature review conjecture the existence of portfolio rebalancing of fund managers
investing in Latin America. Risk-return allocation and eﬀects of unconventional monetary
policies are appointed as determining money ﬂow to Brazil. Additionally, there are evidences
that Brazil is a pathway to intermediate trading in commodities such iron and brent oil. This
article contributes identifying the propagation of risk among these channels, helping traders,
fund managers and scholar’s, to identify the information that matters. Moreover, Policy Makers
may beneﬁt of this exercise by identifying the right incremental variables to implement in models
and the possible consequences and eﬀects of Macro Prudential Policies.

Further works could ﬁll the gap here answering: i) which channel is more relevant; and, ii)
quantify this channel. In this regard, should consider diﬀerent frequencies, periods and variables
to test. The limitations of multivariate modelling here must be surpassed with more robust
approaches, such copulas functions families or Extreme Value Theory(EVT). Other techniques
considered are neural networks or algorithms.
