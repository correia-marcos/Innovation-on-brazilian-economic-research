Abstract: Human capital attainment through higher education gives poverty-trapped individuals a 
chance  to  escape  poverty.  In  Brazil,  incentives  in  the  form  of  educational  loans  (FIES),  college 
scholarships (ProUni) and expansion of public universities (REUNI) are some of the paths through 
which  the  government  may  affect  human  capital  formation.  The  main  goal  of  this  paper  is  to 
develop  a  model  that  explains  how  governmental  incentives  for  higher  education  impact  on 
educational  choices  of  young  individuals.  The  analytical  results  indicate  that  agents  who  have 
enough resources to succeed in the selection process will further their studies in the public system, 
and  that  financially  constrained  individuals  may  prefer  working  and  saving  in  detriment  of  their 
studies.  The  partial  equilibrium  analysis  reveals  that  the  FIES  fund  allows  that  some  financially 
constrained  individuals  be  given  a  chance  to  attend  university,  as  does  the  ProUni  scholarship. 
However, the analysis suggests that REUNI is the most effective educational incentive in the sense 
that it favors equality of opportunity in the Brazilian higher education selection system.

Resumo: A obtenção de capital humano através da educação superior oferece a indivíduos pobres 
uma  chance  de  sair  da  pobreza.  No  Brasil,  incentivos  na  forma  de  empréstimos  educacionais 
(FIES), bolsas de estudos (ProUni) e expansão de universidades públicas (REUNI)  são alguns dos 
programas  através  dos  quais  o  governo  pode  estimular  a  formação  de  capital  humano.  O  objetivo 
principal deste trabalho é desenvolver um modelo que explique como incentivos governamentais ao 
ensino superior impactam nas escolhas educacionais de jovens indivíduos. Os resultados analíticos 
indicam  que  pessoas  que  possuem  recursos  suficientes  para  ter  sucesso  nos  processos  seletivos 
frequentam  uma  universidade  pública,  e  que  indivíduos  com  restrições  financeiras  podem  preferir 
trabalhar  e  poupar  em  detrimento  dos  estudos.  A  análise  de  equilíbrio  parcial  revela  que  o  FIES 
propicia aos jovens sem recursos uma chance de frequentar uma universidade, assim como o faz o

Introduction 

Over the last decades, the Brazilian government, through its Ministry of Education (MEC), 
has designed and implemented incentive programs for higher education, aiming to expand access to 
universities,  in  a  broad  sense,  and  more  specifically,  to  increase  the  stock  of  human  capital  in 
Brazil.  In  view  of  this  goal,  the  incentives  have  been  directed  at  young  individuals  belonging  to 
lower  social  classes,  both  through  the  expansion  of  public  universities  and  through  financing  and 
subsidy of private institutions. Investments  in  human capital  through schooling and training result 
in  skill  gains,  which  in  turn  have  a  positive  and  significant  effect  on  individual  labor  earnings 
(MINCER, 1974).  In the long  run,  such investments are  expected to  lead  to  increase in  economic 
growth,  as  well  as  decrease  in  income  and  wealth  inequality  (SCHULTZ,  1960;  BECKER,  1962; 
ROMER, 1989; GALOR; ZEIRA, 1993; BARRO, 2001; KOCHAR, 2008; CASELLI; CICCONE, 
2013), although the effects of current human capital investments on economic development in the 
future  is  contingent  to  what  happens  with  the  rate  of  return  to  education  between  now  and  then 
(BOURGUIGNON; FERREIRA; LEITE, 2003). 

In order to discuss the matter of formation of – and returns to – human capital in the context 
of  higher  education,  it  is  necessary  to  point  the  basic  differences  between  public  and  private 
university  in  Brazil.  The  more  notable  distinction  is  the  cost  –  while  public  institutions  of  higher 
education do not require payment of a tuition for attendance, private universities do, which makes 
them  inaccessible  to  poor  individuals  in  the  absence  of  financial  aid.  In  addition  to  being  free  of 
charge, public university is comparatively associated with higher education quality, seeing that the 
public  system  is  estimated  to  be  responsible  for  90%  of  the  scientific  production  in  the  country 
(HILU;  GISI,  2011).  The  selection  method,  which  ranks  candidates  based  on  an  exam  named 
ENEM3, tends to favor the applicants who had the resources to go to private school in the childhood 
and to take preparatory courses for the exam. Provided that public university in Brazil is typically 
excluding  to  candidates  coming  from  public  high  school,  it  raises  a  concern  over  the  matter  of 
inequality  of  opportunity4  in  the  higher  education  system,  known  to  be  conducive  to  income  and 
wealth inequality. 

The  Brazilian  government  has  approached  this  issue  through  the  implementation  of  three 
main programs: REUNI, ProUni and FIES. REUNI is a program intended to restructure and expand 
Brazilian  federal  universities.  It  aims  to  raise  the  number  of  openings  in  the  public  system  by 
expanding  courses,  reducing  dropout  rates,  and  occupying  vacant  positions.  Furthermore,  REUNI 
intends to  restructure the academic environment,  as well as renew higher  education pedagogically 
and improve quality of education. The expansion of federal institutions was initiated in the year of 
2003, with the inauguration of campuses on smaller cities across the country. As reported by MEC, 
until  2013  there  were  created  14  new  universities  and  over  100  new  campuses.  Additionally,  the 
number of enrolled students in public universities has reached 1.9 million, in contrast to 1.1 million 
in 2002. 

The University  for All  Program,  or ProUni, was  institutionalized in  the  year of 2005, with 
the  purpose  of  expanding  access  to  higher  education  for  financially  constrained  individuals.  If 
accepted  into  the  program,  the  student  is  awarded  with  a  full  or  a  partial  scholarship  in  a  private 
university. A candidate is eligible for a ProUni scholarship if she obtains the minimum of 450 out 
of 1000 points on ENEM, although the score may need to be higher, depending on the institution, 
the  course,  and  the  competition.  Furthermore,  the  candidate  must  prove  that  her  family  does  not 
have  the  means  to  afford  the  tuition  at  a  private  university.  In  that  interest,  the  monthly  family 
income  per  capita  cannot  exceed  3  times  the  minimum  wage.  Moreover,  the  individual  has  to 
satisfy at least one of the following conditions: complete high school in a public school; complete 
high school in a private school with a full scholarship; attend part of high school in a public school,

4Inequality  of  opportunity  is  borne  by  the  fact  that  wealth  and  social  status  affect  how  an  individual  does  in  life

and  part  in  a  private  school  with  a  full  scholarship;  have  a  disability;  be  a  teacher  in  elementary 
school. The number of ProUni scholarships has increased significantly – in 2005, 475 scholarships 
where offered, in contrast with the 128 thousand contracts in the year of 2013. 

FIES  is  a  student  finance  fund  that  makes  loans  to  private  university  attendees,  or 
candidates,  at  lower  rates  than  those  practiced  by  commercial  banks  –  MEC  stipulates  3.4%  per 
year  in  2015.  Such  as  ProUni,  the  goal  of  FIES  is  to  reach  less  privileged  high  school  graduates, 
which  is  why  eligibility  is  conditional  to  a  set  of  prerequisites  relating  to  family  income.  FIES 
finances  from  50  up  to  100%  of  tuition  costs,  and  the  beneficiary  has  to  start  paying  her  debt  18 
months after graduation, given that she completes the course. The program was institutionalized in 
1992,  but  it  went  through  several  changes  over  the  years.  Nowadays,  it  is  mandatory  that  the 
candidate take the ENEM exam, and the attainment of a low score may be disqualifying – a recent 
change in legislation determines that the minimum score must be 450, the same as  ProUni. While 
the selection criteria for FIES have become more rigorous, the offer of loans has increased over 6 
times since 2005, reaching almost 560 thousand contracts in 2013. A total of 688 thousand students 
were  contemplated  with  private  university  incentives  in  2013.  They  represent  almost  13%  of 
enrollments in the Brazilian private university system that year. 

Cavalcanti,  Guimarães  &  Sampaio  (2010)  demonstrated  empirically  that  inequality  of 
opportunity  in  Brazil  –  on  what  concerns  human  capital  formation  –  prevents  people  who  cannot 
afford  early  private  education  from  being  admitted  in  a  public  university,  and  thus,  impairs  the 
ability  of  these  individuals  to  better  their  skills.  Their  results  testify  to  the  perverse  effects  of  the 
combination  between  inequality  and  low  social  mobility  between  generations  (BOURGUIGNON; 
FERREIRA;  MENÉNDEZ,  2003).  In  the  same  spirit,  Galor  (2011)  asserts  that  income  inequality 
separates  society  into  two  clubs;  “a  club  of  poor,  uneducated  individuals  and  a  club  of  rich, 
educated  individuals”.  When  lack  of  resources  and  difficult  access  to  credit  prevent  individuals 
from  investing  in  education  or  training,  the  long  term  result  is  deficient  human  capital 
accumulation,  which  hinders  economic  development.  Galor  &  Moav  (2004)  develop  a  general 
equilibrium model that highlights the role of human capital in this interaction, and demonstrates that 
underinvestment  in  education  and  training  is  associated  with  credit  constraints  and  diminishing 
marginal returns in human capital formation. 

Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  human  capital  attainment  can  assume  various  forms,  such  as 
on-the-job  training  and  learning-by-doing  –  which  may  be  just  as  important  as  schooling  for  the 
process  of  accumulation  –  we  emphasize  the  role  of  the  latter  in  the  workings  of  social  mobility 
mechanisms. Education provides individuals with more than just tools to achieve a successful career 
and a sizeable income wage. Education spills over to society and contribute to development in many 
fronts, by inducing individuals to innovate, stimulate critical thinking and raise political awareness. 
Through  these  channels  education  enables  poverty-trapped  individuals  to  promote  the  structural 
changes necessary for them to actually move upward in the social ladder.  

Our main objective in this paper is to develop a theoretical model that explains the dynamics 
of higher education choice and its relation to governmental incentives in Brazil, building from the 
Theory of Search5. Although search models are more commonly applied to labor market  analysis, 
they  may  be  used  to  model  other  situations  that  involve  an  individual  (or  a  group  of  individuals) 
choosing between two different courses of action. We departure from the standard usage of search 
theory by applying it to a problem of higher education choice. In our model, heterogeneous agents 
who  have  finished  high  school  choose  whether  they  will  take  a  job  right  away  or  further  their 
education  before  starting  a  career.  They  make  decisions  according  to  their  preferences  and  the 
constraints  they  face.  Moreover,  those  who  decide  against  working  have  yet  to  choose  between 

                                                 

5Lucas  (1987)  described  search  theory  as  being  a  “real  social  science:  an  attempt  to  model,  to  understand,  human 
behavior  by  visualizing  the  situations  people  find  themselves  in,  the  options  they  face  and  the  pros  and  cons  as  they 
themselves  see  them”.  Search  models  are  widely  used  in  the  investigation  of  labor  markets,  in  particular  for  matters 
related  to job  search. They  place  unemployed  workers  in  a  setting  where  they  are  faced  with  work  opportunities  that 
arrive randomly, and where they have the option to reject an available offer if they think they will receive a better offer 
in the future. See McCall (1970) and Neal (1998) for more on job search models.

public or private university. We also contribute to the literature by modeling the trade-offs between 
different governmental policies – FIES, ProUni and REUNI – for human capital formation. 

The  results  indicate  that,  while  the  existence  of  FIES  allows  that  some  financially 
constrained  individuals  be  given  a  chance  of  overcoming  poverty,  the  fact  that  they  will  be 
acquiring debt and also giving up the opportunity of working  and saving presently deters many of 
them from attending private university. ProUni appears to be more effective in increasing the share 
of  poor  individuals  in  the  higher  education  system,  however,  when  we  look  at  public  university 
access, this form of incentive is not satisfactory. Given that  public university gives students better 
conditions to improve their skills, it is debatable whether ProUni does much for reducing inequality 
of  opportunity.  Accordingly,  the  analysis  indicates  that  the  expansion  of  public  universities 
(REUNI)  is  the  most  effective  educational  incentive  in  the  sense  that  it  prevents  wealth  bias  and 
promotes equality of opportunity in the higher education selection system.

The Model 

We develop  an overlapping  generations model in  which agents  live for two periods,  youth 
and adulthood. The dynamics between generations are such that each young individual is endowed 
with  a  bequest  that  is  a  result  of  the  optimal  choice  of  resource  allocation  made  by  the  previous 
generation,  given  that  each  adult  has  to  distribute  her  lifetime  income  among  consumption  and 
bequest.  The  latter  is  applied  to  the  investment  in  human  capital  for  the  offspring,  in  form  of 
education.  When  a  young  individual  is  finished  with  high  school  –  which  can  be  more  or  less 
suitable to the pursue of a higher education degree depending on family wealth – she has to choose 
whether to join the labor force straightaway (offering one unit of unskilled labor) or to continue her 
education in a university. If she decides to attend university, the subsequent choice is between the 
private and the public system of higher education. 

Public university is more desirable because it is free of charge and associated with a higher 
quality,  providing  a  higher  share  of  qualified  graduates  in  comparison  to  private  university.  The 
selection  process  benefits  those  whose  family  wealth  is  higher,  because  entrance  in  the  public 
system  is  constrained  by  the  costs  of  high  quality  basic  education.  The  way  through  which 
governmental  policies  can  affect  individual  choice  is  alleviating  the  financial  constraints  of  poor 
individuals. In this spirit, we model governmental incentives in form of loans and subsidies in the 
private  system  (FIES  and  ProUni)  and  mitigation  of  the  entrance  cost  in  the  public  system 
(REUNI).  Finally,  we  perform  a  theoretical  analysis  of  the  dynamics  in  the  model  economy,  in 
terms of the impact on the educational choices of young individuals. 

2.1  Overview of The Model 

The  economy  is  defined  over  an  overlapping  generations  model,  introduced  by  Samuelson 
(1958).  In  this  model,  agents  type 
  live  for  two  periods,  youth  and  adulthood.  There  is  no 
population growth, such that each adult has only one parent and only one child. We define that the 
, and it 
measure of the population is  the unity.  In this economy,  the initial  wealth of agents is 

varies across individuals. They optimize their discounted lifetime utility, where the discount rate is 
given  by .  Agents’  preferences  are  homogeneous,  and  defined  only  over  consumption,
,  if  the 

agent  hasn’t  reached  adulthood.  The  instantaneous  utility  for  a  young  individual  is 

.  In  the 

case  of  adults,  lifetime  utility  is  defined  over  consumption, 

,  and  future  utility  of  offspring, 

. The mechanism through which parents contribute to their children’s welfare, and therefore, 

to their own, is by saving and making intergenerational transfers, 

. Instantaneous utility for an 

adult can be written as:

where 

. 

The  problems  of  the  agents  will  be  solved  recursively.  To  make  notation  simpler,  we  will 
not use a time subscript on variables from now on, neither will we use a superscript to differentiate 
individuals. In this model, young agents choose whether they will further their education or not. If 
they choose not to go to a university, then they will join the workforce offering one unit of unskilled 
labor now and in the adulthood, earning 
 as income wage. If they choose to go to a university, 

they  subsequently  have  to  choose  between  a  public  or  a  private  institution.  Let 
be  the 
discrete variable that indicates the agent’s choice – its value is 1 when she goes to a university, and 
0 when she chooses to work. 

There exists a probability

 of becoming a skilled professional associated with graduation

worker is 

. Similarly, if the agent goes to a private institution, the probability that she becomes a 

skilled professional is

.  Furthermore,  private  universities  require  payment  of  a  tuition,

universities do not,  but  they  have  an entrance cost, 
exogenously, in terms of the final good in the economy. 

. We define that

Moreover, there exists a temporal gap which makes the payment of 
 relatively more costly 
than

attainment  of  a  good  grade  in  the  entrance  exam  which,  in  turn,  depends  on  the  quality  of  basic 
schooling and preparatory courses. Both these elements require that the family wealth is sufficiently 
large  when  the  individual  is  at  a  young  age,  so  public  universities  are  often  inaccessible  to  poor 
agents. Finally, there exists a government subsidy 
 which is given to agents to encourage them to 
attend private university. The aggregate state variables for all agents are the aggregate capital in the 
economy,

2.2  The Adult’s Problem 

For the adults in this economy, the individual state variables are wealth, 

, past choice of institution, 

, and characterization of labor, 

, past education, 
 (unskilled or 

skilled). The control variables for adults are consumption, 
The resulting optimization problem is:

In order to make facilitate the solution of equation (3), we will solve two different problems: 
one for the agents who attend university and other for the ones who do not. The agent whose choice 
is 
,  that  is,  work  instead  of  studying,  knows  that  she  will  be  offering  one  unit  of  unskilled 
labor now and in adulthood, so she knows exactly what her income wage will be in the future. The 
resulting problem is:

Partial Equilibrium Analysis 

3.1  Analytical Results 

Appendix shows the solution for the problems of each type of agent in the economy – adults, 
young individuals who go to public university, young individuals who attend private university, and 
young  individuals  who  don’t  further  their  studies  and  go  straight  to  the  work  market.  Those 
problems are solved recursively, starting with the adult’s problem and replacing the optimal value 
function into each young agent’s problem, so that we can find the optimal value functions for these 
individuals as well.  

Proposition 1: If 

, then: 

 

 

1. The consumption is optimal, i.e., 

 is given by equation (A16) in Appendix. 

2. 

 

Proof: According to Proposition 1, bequest does not constrain the agent’s decision as long as 
,  and  present 

  is  large  enough  to  pay  for  both  the  present  value  of  university  entrance  cost, 

.  With  regard  to 

, 
consumption, 
which  cannot  be  true,  since  the  agent’s  received  bequest  needs  to  be  large  enough  to  cover  her 
expenses. Therefore, 

. This condition holds if and only if 

:  by  contradiction,  if 

,  then 

. 

From  now  on,  we  will  distinguish  between  savings  made  by  agents  who  attend  public 
. It is already know, from (A18) and (A25), 

, and agents who go to public ones, 

institutions, 

that 

, given that 

. 

 

Assumption 1: 

 

The assumption above guarantees that, if an agent is rich enough, i.e., 

, 

with 
 given implicitly by (A16), then the agent who decides to further her education will choose 
a public university instead of a private one. Therefore, the choice of university depends on the agent 
not  being  constrained  by  her  wealth.  Moreover,  the  higher  the  cost  of  entrance  of  public 
universities,  the  higher  the  likelihood  of  being  constrained  by  wealth,  and  the  higher  the  share  of 
young agents who choose private institutions (if it is the case that they can afford both consumption 
and school debt in the next period of their lives). 

Putting such information in context with REUNI, an increase in the number of openings in 
the  public  system  of  higher  education  is  associated  with  a  decline  in  relative  competition.  In  the 
model  economy,  this  is  equivalent  to  a  decrease  in  the  cost  of  entrance, 
.  Consequently, 
expansions in public universities increase the share of young agents who attend public institutions. 

 

Proposition 2: 

 

education,  then  agent  with  wealth 

Proof:  Since  optimal  consumption  is  the  same  for  all  agents  who  choose  to  further  their 
  will  choose  a  public  university  if  and  only  if

have that: 

(8) 

 

We  will  call  the  expression 

  the  expected  income  wage  for  a  public 

university attendee, or 

. Similarly, the expression 

 will be called the 

expected  income  wage  for  a  private  university  attendee,  or 

.  Also,  from  equations 

(A17)  and  (A23)  we  have  that 

.  Replacing  these  expressions  into  equation  (8)  and 

rearranging the terms we get Assumption 1: 

(9) 

 

Moreover,  the  government  may  choose  to  give  a  subsidy, 

,  to  young  agents  who  attend 
private  universities.  The  government  may  choose  any  value  between  0  and  1  as  a  subsidy  rate.  If 
 then the agent’s debt will be equal to zero, which means that the government is paying in full 

for the agent’s education. Using equation (9): 

(10) 

 

The  existence  of  a  full  subsidy  makes  it  less  likely  that  an  agent  will  choose  a  public 
university,  because  the  subsidy  makes  it  relatively  less  costly  to  attend  a  private  institution. 
Accordingly,  the  share  of  financially  constrained  young  agents  who  choose  to  attend  private 
university in detriment of public university is higher. Note that an agent who is not constrained by 
wealth will choose a public university (see Assumption  1).  In  contrast,  when 
 the agent  will 
 to the government after her education is complete and she gets a job. Once more, we 
have to pay 
will use equation (9) to show that: 

(11) 

 

Firstly, if the cost of public university does not constrain the agent, she will choose a public 
university  regardless  of  whether  the  government  is  paying  the  costs  of  private  education  or  not 
(again,  see  Assumption  1).  On  the  other  hand,  for  the  case  of  a  financially  constrained  individual 
(for  whom  public  university  is  desirable  but  not  necessarily  accessible),  the  absence  of  a  subsidy 
(which  entails  that  the  agent  will  own 
  to  the  FIES  fund  in  the  future)  makes  attendance  to  a 
, 
private university  relatively more costly.  If a poor agent  goes through with university  with 

when she becomes an adult with budget constraint 
, it may be the 
case that she will not be able to pay for her FIES loan and save. Through this mechanism, it is likely 
that  the  next  generation  will  be  subjected  to  the  same  constraints.  This  result  is  consistent  with 
Galor & Zeira (1993), who have found that skilled individuals who pay student loans do not leave 
as  many  resources  for  the  next  family  generation  as  individuals  who  have  come  from  a  wealthy 
family. 

Therefore, equations (9) to (11) assure that the higher the subsidy 

 from the government, 
the  higher  the  share  of  agents  who  choose  to  attend  private  university.  For  those  individuals  who

,  and 
conversely, for those who do not want to (or cannot) risk acquiring educational debt (FIES) without 
guarantees of future income, subsidy in the form of a program such as ProUni may be the only path 
for escaping poverty. 

As  done  previously  for  other  agents,  we  will  call  the  savings  made  by  agents  who  do  not

Assumption 2: 

   

This assumption makes it so that the higher the share of young agents who are constrained 
by their wealth, the higher the share of agents who choose to work instead of going to a university. 
Furthermore, the higher the unskilled wage, the higher the proportion of young agents who choose 
to  work.  Additionally,  Assumption  2  guarantees  that,  if  agent  is  rich  enough,  she  will  choose  to 
further her education. 

Proposition  3: 

If

, 

is  so 

that 

, 

then 

. 

Proof: If studying in a public university is at least just as good as studying in a private one, 
then studying in a public university has to be better than not studying at all. Using equations (A10), 
(A16) e (A24) on 

 we can show that: 

(12) 

 

As  we  did  previously,  we  will  call  the  expression 

the  expected  income 

wage for a public university attendant,  or 

.  In  addition  to  that, from  equations  (A17) 

and (11) we have that 

. Using that information on equation (12) we get that: 

(13) 

 

It is interesting to notice that the term 

 represents the discounted income wage of a 
young  agent  who  chooses  to  work  instead  of  studying.  We  don’t  call  it  expected  income  wage 
because  we  know  for  sure  that  an  agent  who  does  not  attend  university  will  offer  one  unit  of 
unskilled labor, and therefore will receive 
 as payment for her work. Moreover, from equations 
(11) and (13) we have that:  

(14) 

 

 
Equation  (14)  indicates  that  higher  values  of  unskilled  wage  and  private  university’s  costs 
are associated with a smaller share of agents attending private university and consequently a higher 
share  of  young  agents  joining  the  labor  force.  When  we  consider  individuals  with  limited  family 
wealth, faced with the possibility of a position as a skilled professional in the future (alongside with

consumption  and  maybe  saving),  foregoing  university  attendance  may  be  the  best  option  for  the 
bulk  of  young  agents  in  this  position.  The  temporal  gap  between  unskilled  and  (possibly)  skilled 
wage  may  be  too  costly  for  some,  so  they  choose  consumption  and  saving  over  investments  in 
human capital which, in turn, may result in families being poverty trapped for generations to come. 

3.2  Qualitative results 

 and 

Figure  1  shows  that  individuals  born  with  bequest  inferior  to 

  choose  not  to  attend 
university. Those born with bequest between 
 choose to study in  a private institution 
and pay back the FIES fund when they are through with their studies. Note that the government is 
paying a fraction of the costs through ProUni. Moreover, anyone born with bequest superior to 
 
chooses  public  university.  This  corroborates  Assumption  1  in  the  previous  section:  as  long  as  the 
agent  is  not  constrained  by  her  wealth,  that  is, 
,  she  will  choose  to  attend  a 
public  university,  where  her  chances  to  become  a  skilled  professional  in  the  future  are  higher. 
Wealth  inequality  makes  it  so  that  only  individuals  with  a  minimal  amount  of  wealth  are  able  to 
make  unconstrained  decisions  of  higher  education,  in  detriment  of  poor  agents.  As  Banerjee  & 
Newman  (1993)  have  argued,  differences  in  wealth  at  least  partially  explain  different  choices  of 
occupation (or comparatively, education).  

A  change  in  the  subsidy  parameter  to 

,  which  means  that  the  government  gives  no 
financial  aid  to  poor  individuals,  results  in  the  situation  depicted  in  Figure  2.  When  subsidies  for 
private university  (ProUni) do not  exist, attending university is not  an option for poor individuals 
 is the level of wealth associated with 
(see the trajectory of function value 

). We have that 

attendance of public university. Actually, the fact that an individual has the means to attend a public 
institution of higher education is indicative of the existence of enough resources to go through with 
private university. However, as we already know, an agent who is not financially constrained will 
prefer to continue her studies in the public system. 

The  outcome  we  get  when  the  government  gives  full  subsidy  to  poor  individuals  is 
). In this case, the existence of full 
illustrated in Figure 3, the case of ProUni full scholarships (
subsidy  allows  individuals  born  with  wealth  between 
  access  to  higher  education  in 
private institutions, which accounts for a much wider range of assistance then what we observed in 
Figure 1. The wealth threshold for public university, in contrast, becomes extremely high. Note that 
the trajectory of 
 in the visible area of the graph. This suggests, on the one 

 does not reach 

  and 

hand, that public university is accessible to a very small share of young individuals in the presence 
of 
.  On  the  other  hand  –  and  more  intuitively  –  it  may  simply  be  a  case  of  ill-directed 
governmental incentive.  

The case of REUNI is illustrated in Figure 4. When the government chooses to direct part of 
the  budget  for  higher  education  incentive  to  the  expansion  of  public  universities  (which  is 
associated with  a decrease in  the cost  of entrance 
, given Assumption  1) we  get  that  the wealth 
gap  between  individuals  who  choose  private  university  and  those  who  choose  public  university 
diminishes  substantially  –  note  the  distance  between 
  in  the  graph.  Although 
individuals who are not as rich as 
 will not be able to further their education, among those who 
will  do  it  there  will  be  more  equality  of  opportunity  in  the  competition  for  spots  in  public 
universities. Consequently, poor and rich individuals will have, if not equal, at least similar chances 
of becoming skilled professionals when they graduate6.

parameter while keeping others at their baseline values and (ii) repeating first step for all interesting parameters while 
returning the previous parameter to its baseline value. We found that the model is robust to 1 and 5% increases in the 
parameters of interest Q0, Q1, ∅, 𝜏 and 𝛿.

Concluding Remarks 

This research aimed to contribute to the debate on human capital investment, and to develop 
a  theoretical  model  that  is  fit  to  explain  how  individuals  make  educational  choices  in  Brazil,  and 
how the government can affect these choices through educational policies. This is the first effort of 
a broader investigation – the model developed in this paper will be calibrated for the case of Brazil 
in  order  to  analyze  the  effects  of  governmental  incentives  on  macroeconomic  variables  such  as 
economic growth and wealth inequality. Moreover, simulation will provide quantitative results for 
variables such as skill premium. 

The analytical results are consistent with the observed reality of higher education in Brazil – 
they reveal that public university is more desirable than private university, and that agents who have 
enough resources to succeed in the selection process will further their studies in the public system. 
Furthermore, the analysis reveals that individuals who are constrained by their wealth may choose 
not  to  further  their  education.  Finally,  the  results  indicate  that  the  existence  of  governmental 
subsidies make it more likely that a financially constrained individual attend university. 

The  partial  equilibrium  analysis  give  us  some  insight  on  the  impacts  of  governmental 
incentives on human capital formation through education. While the existence of FIES allows that 
some  financially  constrained  individuals  be  given  a  chance  of  overcoming  poverty,  the  fact  that 
they  will  be  acquiring  debt  and  also  giving  up  the  opportunity  of  working  and  saving  presently 
deters many of them from attending private university. In comparison, ProUni appears to be more 
effective in increasing the share of poor individuals in the higher education system. However, when 
we  look  at  public  university  access,  this  form  of  incentive  is  not  satisfactory.  Given  that  public 
university  gives  students  better  conditions  to  improve  their  skills,  it  is  debatable  whether  ProUni 
does  much  for  reducing  inequality  of  opportunity.  Accordingly,  the  partial  equilibrium  analysis 
indicates that the expansion of public universities is the most effective educational incentive in the 
sense  that  it  prevents  wealth  bias  and  promotes  equality  of  opportunity  in  the  higher  education 
selection system.
