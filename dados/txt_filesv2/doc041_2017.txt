We test for the presence  of three types  of rational  bubbles in the BRICS  exchange  rates 
against the US dollar. For the fundamental value of the exchange rate, we use two structural 
specifications: the exchange rate defined by the pure PPP rule, and by a PPP rule adjusted 
for  the  interest  rate  differential  between  the  two  countries.  For  the  bubble  dynamics,  we 
consider explosive bubbles, periodically collapsing bubbles and intrinsic bubbles. We find 
evidence consistent with of the presence of at least one of these bubbles for each country 
in the group, except for South Africa, confirming the results of other periodically recurring 
bubble tests for this dataset.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Rational  bubbles  are  present  in  asset  prices  when  they  deviate  from  their 
fundamental values, which is determined by the fundamental economic factors driving their 
long  term  behavior,  which  is  derived  from  a  partial  or  general  equilibrium  model.  It  is 
important to detect their presence and understand their behavior because they may  distort 
agents'  decisions,  as  shown  by  Brunnermeier  and  Oehmke  (2013),  or  lead  to  economic 
fluctuations,  recessions,  and  financial  crisis  when  the  bubble  bursts,  as  exemplified  by 
Kindlerberg and Aliber (2005). 

 
The model for the fundamental value must be based on the principles of profit and/or 
utility maximization, inter-temporal budget balance, the risk-return tradeoff characterized by 
the CAPM (capital asset pricing model) in one of its versions, and the inexistence of riskless 
arbitrage  opportunities.  The  exogenous  variables  which  appear  in  the  fundamental  price 
model are called the fundamentals. 

The theory of such phenomena started with Blanchard (1979), that showed rational 
decision  making  in  a  stochastic  dynamic  environment  can  produce  rational  bubbles  that 
display  an  explosive  behavior.  Blanchard  and Watson  (1982)  generalize  that  model  and 
consider a specification that  allows for an exogenous probability of the bubble collapsing. 
Several tests for explosive bubbles were proposed by them, and several other have been 
proposed since  then  and  applied to  a number  of  different  asset  markets,  as surveyed  by 
Brunnermeier (2008). Flood and Garber (1980) perform some the first tests for the presence 
of deterministic bubbles in  prices, using the framework  of the Cagan (1956)  model  of the 
German hyperinflation, and conclude that there is no evidence of the presence of bubbles.   
Diba and Grossman (1984)  propose the use of stationarity tests to reject the presence of 
explosive  bubbles.  Diba  and  Grossman  (1988)  apply  such  tests  to  stock  prices  using  a 
model  that  considers  allows  for  the  presence  of  unobservable  variables  among  the 
fundamentals. Froot  e Obstfeld (1991)  argue for  the  use  of  intrinsic bubbles, i.e.  bubbles 
where all of their variability is derived from exogenous economic fundamentals and not from 
extraneous factors  nor  expectations  of long  run  arbitrage,  and  apply  it to  modeling stock 
market prices. They claim it is a more plausible empirical account of deviations from present-
value pricing than that of the earlier types of rational bubbles.  

 
Evans  (1991)  developed  a  model  where  bubbles  that  collapse  periodically  which 
avoids the theoretical restrictions of Blanchard (1979)  whereby rational bubbles cannot be 
negative and, once they emerge they must burst and eventually disappear. Whenever the 
bubble exceeds a certain value, it enters into a regime that shifts its behavior between two 
trajectories: it can either grow faster, or it can collapse  and revert to the mean. He shows 
that the tests developed by Diba and Grossman (1984) are unable to detect the presence 
of this class of rational bubbles. Van Norden and Schaller (1993) propose an alternative to 
Evans' specification, where the probability of the regime switch is a function of the size of 
the bubble, rather than being fixed, and where the regime is unobservable. They apply their 
model to a sample of stock exchange returns,  and are unable to reject the hypothesis that 
bubbles are present. Bohl (2003) tests for the presence of Evans bubbles in a sample of the 
US  stock  market  index  using  the  momentum  threshold  autoregressive  (MTAR)  model 
proposed by Enders and Siklos (2001), and is unable to reject their presence. 

Periodically collapsing bubbles have been used to model exchange rates series. Van 
 
Norden (1996) specifies a particular probabilistic model for the regime change and for the 
size of the bubble in each regime and  tests for the presence of speculative bubbles in the 
exchange rates of Canada, Japan and Germany against the US dollar from 1977 to 1991. 
He uses the long term exchange rate from a modified PPP model as the fundamental and 
use an exogenous value to anchor its level. Maldonado, Tourinho and Valli (2012) extend 
that model by using a non-linear specification for the size of the bubble in the survival regime 
and allowing the endogenous determination of the fundamental value level. One advantage 
2 

 

of the extended model is that it allows the rationality in the formation of expectations in the 
foreign exchange market to be tested.  

The BRICS countries group (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) is often 
singled out for special consideration in the set of emerging market economies because of 
the size and importance of the countries that compose it, and because they are at a roughly 
similar stage of economic development. Also, economic crisis in the countries of the group 
display  some  correlation,  which  can  be  assessed  by  examining  episodes  in  stock  and 
foreign exchange markets where these asset prices display bubble-like behavior. This can 
be  done  by  estimating  regime-switching  bubbles  or  by  using  semi-parametric  testing 
procedures. An example of the first approach Maldonado, Tourinho and Abreu (2016), that 
use the Maldonado, Tourinho and Valli (2012) methodology to model to the exchange rates 
to the BRICS  against the US dollar, and find that the model passes most of the standard 
specification tests for each country, yielding evidence of the presence of rational bubbles in 
all of them. They also explore the existence of regularities spanning all the countries in the 
group  regarding  the  timing  of  the  inception  and  collapse  of  bubbles  by  testing  for 
cointegration  between  the  relative  (proportional)  bubbles  in  the  exchange  rates,  and 
estimate a vector error correction model (VEC) that captures the interaction between them. 
They  find  evidence  of  cointegration,  and  argue  this  means  that  there  is  transmission  of 
shocks between the foreign exchange markets for the currency of these countries. 

This  paper  tests  the  presence  of  other  types  of  bubbles  in  the  exchange  rates  of 
BRICS  countries:  Blanchard's  (1979)  explosive  bubbles,  Froot  e  Obstfeld  (1991)  intrinsic 
bubbles, and Evans (1991) bubbles periodically collapsing bubbles. The paper proceeds as 
follows.  Section  2  describes  the  theoretical  specification  of  the  three  types  of  rational 
bubbles  considered  here,  section  3  presents  the  data,  and  section  4  discusses  the 
estimation and tests of the models. We present the conclusions in section 5. 

2.  THREE TYPES OF SPECULATIVE BUBBLES 

 
As discussed  above, the bubble  is the  difference  between  the  observed  exchange 
rate and its fundamental value. A test for the presence of bubbles in the time series for the 
price of a given asset is in fact a joint test of the presence of the specified bubble and of a 
particular  model  for  the  fundamental  (long  run)  value  of  the  asset.  Here,  since  we  are 
interested in exchange rates, we adopt the simplest and most universal model for the long 
term interest rate, namely, Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). This approach  is also adopted 
in many other studies, and finds its empirical support in an extensive literature. In particular, 
we  consider  here  two  of  the  three  models  proposed  by  Maldonado,  Tourinho  and  Valli 
(2012), and also used in Maldonado, Tourinho and Abreu (2016). They rationalize the use 
of pure PPP by requiring the absence of riskless arbitrage opportunities for firms operating 
in the foreign exchange market. They further extend that model to derive an extended PPP 
rule  which  takes  into  consideration  the  interest  rate  differentials  between  the  home  and 
foreign country.  This  is  done by  extending their  model to  take  into  consideration  that the 
firm, in setting up the arbitrage portfolio, may have the opportunity to borrow funds. These 
two rules can be formalized as follows.1 

 

The fundamental value of the pure PPP model, denoted 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

(1)

, is given by: 

𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

(1) = 𝑘1 (

𝐼𝑃𝐷𝑡
𝐼𝑃𝐹𝑡

)   = 𝑘1𝐼𝑡

(1)                                                          (1) 

where 𝐼𝑃𝐷𝑡 and 𝐼𝑃𝐹𝑡 are, respectively, the domestic and foreign price indices, and 𝑘1 is a 
normalization constant. In the van Norden model it is determined by the ratio of the exchange 
rate  and  the  relative  price  index  at  a  reference  date  when  he  considers  a  bubble  is  not

present. In general, it should be endogenously estimated, if the specified bubble model is 
able  to  identify  that  parameter.  The  second  model  is  similar  to  the  first  one  but  adds  a 
correction for the interest rate differential between the two countries: 

𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

(2) = 𝑘2 (

𝐼𝑃𝐷𝑡+1
𝐼𝑃𝐹𝑡+1

) (

1 + 𝐼𝑅𝐹𝑡
1 + 𝐼𝑅𝐷𝑡

(2)

) = 𝑘2𝐼t

                                                (2) 

where 𝐼𝑅𝐹𝑡 e 𝐼𝑅𝐷𝑡 are the foreign and domestic interest rates and the other variables are as 
before.  

 

These fundamental values satisfy the following non-arbitrage condition: 

𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

(𝑖) − 𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡 = 𝑎𝐸𝑡[𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡+1

(𝑖) − 𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡+1] 

where 𝑎 ∈ (0,1) is a discount factor. Successive forward substitutions yields: 

𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡 = 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

(𝑖) + 𝐵𝑡

(𝑖)

 

(𝑖) = lim
T→+∞

(𝑖) ]  . Under regularity conditions for the stochastic 
where 𝐵𝑡
processes involved in the above expression, it is not difficult to prove that the exchange rate 
bubble 

𝑎𝑇𝐸𝑡[𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡+𝑇 − 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡+1

satisfies the classical explosive bubble equation: 

(𝑖) = 𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡 − 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡
𝐵𝑡

(𝑖),                                                         (3) 

𝐸(𝐵𝑡+1

(𝑖) |𝛺𝑡 ) = 𝑎−1𝐵𝑡

(𝑖),                                                             (4) 

where Ω𝑡 is the information set at 𝑡. Thus, in expected value, the rational bubble will grow 
indefinitely over time.  

2.1. Explosive Bubbles 

The main difficulty in testing for the presence of rational bubbles  in series represented by 
equation (3) is to decompose the observed price between the bubble and the fundamentals, 
since the latter is  unobservable. The  approach developed by  Diba  and Grossman (1988) 
address this situation and test null hypothesis of presence of explosive bubbles in the price 
series  (in  their  case,  the  stock  market  index),  even  when  some  fundamentals  are  not 
observable. They observe that, over time, prices are expected to move further away from 
the  asset's  fundamental  value  (equation  (4))  and  propose  the  use  of  unit  root  tests  and 
cointegration to test for the presence of explosive bubbles.  

 
If the price and the fundamental value have a long-term equilibrium relationship, the 
presence of explosive bubbles is ruled out. When this does is not the case, it is not possible 
to reject the hypothesis that bubbles are present in the series. However, it is not possible to 
state that they are present, since the absence of a long-term relation can be due to  other 
factors (for example, it can be due to the non-stationarity of the fundamental). 

2.2. Periodically Collapsing Bubbles 

Several models of periodically collapsing bubbles are available in the literature, as indicated 
earlier.  For  exchange  rates,  one  of  the  most  successful  is  the  van  Norden  (1996)  model 
which is  based in  a  dynamics  characterized  by the  occurrence  of non-observable  events 
(collapse and survival of the bubble). An  extended version ot that model has been applied 
to the exchange rates of BRICS countries in Maldonado, Tourinho and Abreu (2016).  

To better characterize the nature of these differences, and maybe understand bett er 
their implications,  we  estimate  an  alternative  bubble  model  which has  a sharper  dynamic 
behavior, and more clearly reflects the change from a mostly stationary phenomenon to an 
essentially  explosive  one.  This  is  the  case  of  the  Evans  (1991)  model,  which  can  be 
formalized as:  

4 

 

{

𝐵𝑡+1 = (1 + 𝑟)𝐵𝑡 𝑢𝑡+1

𝐵𝑡+1 = [𝛿 + 𝜋 −1(1 + 𝑟)𝜃𝑡+1(𝐵𝑡 − (1 + 𝑟)−1𝛿)]𝑢𝑡+1

if 𝐵𝑡 ≤ 𝛼                 (5) 
 
if 𝐵𝑡 > 𝛼                (6)

 
where  𝛿 is the constant discount factor,  0 < (1 + 𝑟)−1 < 1,  and 𝛼 is  a positive parameter, 
such  that  0 < 𝛿 < (1 + 𝑟)𝛼,  𝑢𝑡+1  is  an  independent  and  identically  distributed  positive 
random variable with 𝐸𝑡[𝑢𝑡+1] = 1, 𝜃𝑡+1 is an independent and identically Bernoulli random 
variable which is equal to 1 with probability 𝜋, and 0 with probability 1 − 𝜋, where 0 < 𝜋 ≤ 1. 
Whenever  𝐵𝑡  is  smaller  than  𝛼,  the  bubble  will  grow  at  the  average  rate  1 + 𝑟,  and  the 
collapse probability is null. However, after the size of the bubble exceeds 𝛼, the bubble starts 
growing faster, at the average rate (1 + 𝑟)𝜋 −1 and can collapse with a probability  (1 − 𝜋). 
When it does collapse,  𝐵𝑡  does not become null, but rather assumes a small value  𝛿, and 
the process restarts. 

The 

threshold  autoregressive  model  (TAR)  and 

 
threshold 
autoregressive model (MTAR) developed by Enders and Siklos (2001) can be used to test 
for the presence  of this type  of bubble,  as indicated  by Bohl (2003) for  the case  of stock 
prices.  Applying  the  same  methodology  to  our  exchange  series,  we  estimate  the 
cointegration relation between  the spot  exchange rate  and the fundamental  value divided 
by the scaling factor:  

the  momentum 

𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡 = 𝛽̂

0 + 𝛽̂

1(𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

(𝑖) 𝑘𝑖⁄ ) + 𝜇𝑡 = 𝛽̂

0 + 𝛽̂

(𝑖)
1𝐼𝑡

+ 𝜇𝑡;                            (7) 

(𝑖)

(𝑖)

 is the index associated with the 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

where 𝐼𝑡
 according to equations (1) and (2). The 
dynamics  of  this  type  of  bubbles  suggest  there  is  asymmetry  of  the  residuals  of  the 
cointegration  regression  which  can  be  captured  by  cumulative  deviations  𝜇𝑡  above  the 
threshold, followed by an abrupt fall to the threshold. This can be detected by estimating the 
following error correction model: 

𝑝−1

∆𝜇𝑡 = Γ𝑡𝜌1𝜇𝑡−1 + (1 − Γ𝑡)𝜌2𝜇𝑡−1 + ∑ 𝛾𝑖

∆𝜇𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑡;                              (8) 

𝑖=1

where the indicator variable Γ𝑡 is defined (for the TAR model) as follows: 

Γ𝑡 = 1  𝑖𝑓  𝜇𝑡−1 ≥  𝜏,                                                                 (9) 
Γ𝑡 = 0  𝑖𝑓  𝜇𝑡−1 <  𝜏,                                                               (10) 
where 𝜏 represents the threshold value of the cumulative deviations. The MTAR model is 
similar to TAR, but the indicator variable is as follows:  

Γ𝑡 = 1  𝑖𝑓  ∆𝜇𝑡−1 ≥ 𝜏,                                                             (11) 
Γ𝑡 = 0  𝑖𝑓  ∆𝜇𝑡−1 < 𝜏,                                                             (12) 
According to Enders and Siklos (2001) in many economic applications the value 𝜏 =
 
0 can be  adopted. Alternatively,  𝜏 can  be chosen using the  methodology in Chan  (1993), 
which is based  on  the  time series  of  estimated  residuals,  as follows.  The  15% larger  and 
smaller valued residuals are discarded, the TAR and MTAR models are estimated for each 
of the remaining values, and the threshold which yields the smaller residual sum of squares 
is chosen. The models for which the threshold is estimated in this manner are denominated 
MTAR-consistent (MTARC) and TAR-consistent (TARC). 
 
Two  hypothesis  tests  are  sequentially  performed.  First,  no-cointegration  can  be 
tested either by testing 𝐻0: 𝜌1 = 0 and 𝜌2 = 0 with the 𝑡-statistic, or by testing 𝐻0: 𝜌1 = 𝜌2 =
0, with the 𝜙-statistic, using the critical values provided by Enders and Siklos (2001). If the 
no-cointegration  hypothesis  is  rejected,  a  second  test  is  performed  where  the  null  is  the 
presence  of  symmetry:  𝐻0: 𝜌1 = 𝜌2.  If  the  estimate  of  the  coefficient  𝜌̂1  is  significantly 
different from zero, has a negative sign, and its absolute value is larger than the estimate of 
𝜌̂2,  the  hypothesis  of  a  symmetrical  adjustment  is  rejected.  If  both  hypothesis  (no 
5 

 

cointegration  and  presence  of  symmetry)  are  rejected,  the  inexistence  of  periodically 
collapsing bubbles is rejected, and their presence is accepted. 
 

2.3. Intrinsic Bubbles 

The  bubble  examples  discussed  above  do  not  contemplate  an  interaction  between  the 
bubble and the fundamentals, but there may exist situations where there is reason to believe 
such an interaction exists.  Froot and Obstfeld (1991) specify a type of rational bubbles, the 
intrinsic  bubble,  where  this  possibility  if  modeled  in  and  extreme  form  by  assuming  the 
bubble is  a  deterministic function  of the fundamentals,  and does not depend  on  extrinsic 
factors. For a given (constant) level of fundamentals, the bubble remains constant over time 
but, when fundamentals change, an overreaction of asset price may occur. For example, in 
their application of this formulation to model  the US stock market index, the bubble depends 
only on the dividends stream. Following this approach,  we assume the fundamental  value 
(𝑓𝑡

(𝑖)) follows a random walk with drift: 

(𝑖) = ln 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

where 𝜉𝑡+1 ~ 𝑁(0, 𝜎2). The intrinsic bubble for the exchange rate is then defined by: 

(𝑖) = 𝜇 + 𝑓𝑡
𝑓𝑡+1

(𝑖) + 𝜉𝑡+1,                                                          (13) 

𝐵𝑡 = 𝑐 ⋅ (𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

(𝑖))

𝜆

                                                          (14) 

which must satisfy the fundamental bubble equation (4):   

(𝑖) )
𝐸𝑡 [(𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡+1

𝜆

] = 𝑎−1(𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

(𝑖))

𝜆

                              (15) 

For this equantion to be satisfied, the parameter 𝜆 must satisfy certaind conditions. 

 
To see this, recall that equation (13) implies the following: 

(𝑖) = 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡
 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡+1
(𝑖) )
(𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡+1

= (𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

𝜆

(𝑖) exp{𝜇 + 𝜉𝑡+1}, and 

(𝑖))

𝜆

exp{𝜆𝜇 + 𝜆𝜉𝑡+1} 

Taking the expected value  of both sides  of this expression  above and recalling that 

 
the right-hand side is a log-normal random variable, yields: 

(𝑖) )
𝐸𝑡 [(𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡+1

𝜆

] = (𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

(𝑖))

𝜆

exp {𝜆𝜇 +

𝜆2𝜎2

2

}. 

Substituting  for  the  expectation  in  equation  (15),  it  is  clear  that  𝜆  must  satisfy  the 
 
following  quadratic  equation  (𝜎2 2⁄ )𝜆2 + 𝜇 𝜆 + ln 𝑎 = 0,  which  always  has  a  real  solution, 
since 𝑎 < 1. Therefore, the intrinsic bubble is defined by (14) for that particular value for  𝜆. 
Using the definition of the bubble (equation (3)), yields the following equation for  the spot 
exchange rate: 

𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡 = 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

(𝑖) + 𝑐 ∙ (𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡

(𝑖))

𝜆

                                          (16) 

Recalling that the fundamental value of the exchange rate has been defined here by 
 
(𝑖)
equations (1) and (2), which can be written more concisely as  𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡
 
is either the index of relative prices or the index of relative prices  adjusted for the interest 
rate differential, equation (16) it can be written as:  

(𝑖) = 𝑘𝑖𝐼𝑡

, where 𝐼𝑡

(𝑖)

𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡
(𝑖) = 𝑘(𝑖) + 𝑐𝑖 ∙ (𝐼𝑡
𝐼𝑡

(𝑖))

𝜆−1

                                               (17) 

𝜆

where 𝑐𝑖 = 𝑐 (𝑘(𝑖))
 is a parameter that characterizes the existence of the intrinsic bubble: 
it is present only if it is found to be significantly different from zero in the estimation of (17). 
It is important to note that it also yields an estimate of 𝑘(𝑖), which determines the level of the 
fundamental value.

3.    THE DATABASE 

To test the model, data is required for the spot (SPOT) and for the fundamental exchange 
rates (FUND1 and FUND2)  of each of the five BRICS countries against the US dollar. As 
indicated  earlier,  we  will  test  two  competing  models  for  the  fundamental  rate  for  each 
country. Model I, specified by equation (1), assumes that it satisfies the purchasing power 
parity  (PPP)  relation  while  Model  II,  specified  by  equation  (2),  modifies  that  relation  to 
include the interest rates  differential between  in the country and  the US. We use monthly 
data,  and  the time sample  varies between countries,  as  indicated in Table  1, due  to  data 
availability.

For China the sample starts at the date when the exchange rate ceased to be  pegged 
to  the  US  dollar  and  began  fluctuating  with  respect  to  a  basket  of  currencies  of  trade 
partners. For Russia the sample starting date  was chosen to exclude the period when the 
exchange rate band precluded the market determination of the exchange rate.  

The  spot  exchange  rates  were  obtained  from  the  database  of  the  International 
 
Monetary Fund (IMF). To calculate the index for the fundamental rate of  Model I, for each 
country we used the Producer Price Index (PPI) as the domestic price index and the United 
States PPI as an approximate measure of the international price index. The sources of PPI 
from China and Russia were National Bureau of Statistics of China e Federal State Statistics 
Service - Russian Federation, respectively. To complete the information required for Model 
II, we require indicator of the relevant international interest rate and of the domestic interest 
rate. For the former we used the sum of the interest rates paid on the T-Bill with four weeks 
term, and the Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI+) 2 rate of each country. For India, we 
used the JACI (JP  Morgan Asia Credit Index) rate  as  an  approximation for EMBI+,  which 
started being compiled  only in 2012. For the latter, we used the interbank market  interest

interest rates are from Reuters, via Datastream. 

4.  ESTIMATION AND TESTS  

Tests  were  performed  to  assess  the  presence  of  each  of  the  three  types  of  bubbles 
described in section 3, in exchange rate series of the BRICS countries currency against the 
US dollar. 

4.1. Explosive bubbles 

 
To  test  for  the  presence  of  explosive  bubbles,  first  the  ADF  (Augmented  Dickey-
Fuller), PP (Phillips-Perron) and KPSS (Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin)  unit root 
tests were performed to check for the presence of a unit root. Then the Johansen and Engle-
Granger cointegration tests between the spot and fundamental rates  were used to identify 
the existence of a long-term equilibrium relationship between these series.

For all countries, the ADF e PP  tests did not reject the presence of unit root for the 
SPOT, FUND1 and FUND2 (level) series, and rejected it for their first difference. The KPSS 
test rejected the null hypothesis that the (level) series are stationary, but did not reject the 
hypothesis that its first difference stationary. Therefore, all the exchange rate series, for all 
the countries, were classified as I(1),3 and it was possible to test for cointegration of the spot 
and fundamental rates.  

 
The  Engle-Granger  cointegration  test,  using  the  critical  values  from  MacKinnon 
(2010), show (Table 2) that the presence of a unit root in the residuals of the cointegration 
relation  cannot  be  ruled  out  for  any  country,  at  a  significance  level  of  5%,  and  that  the 
cointegration  hypothesis  can  be    rejected.  Therefore,  this  test  is  unable  to  reject  the 
hypothesis that bubbles are present in the exchange rate series of all BRICS countries.  The 
results of the Johansen cointegration test (Table 3 and 4) confirm these results and indicate 
the  rejection  of  the  cointegration  hypothesis  for  all  countries,  except  for  South  Africa. 
Therefore, it is not possible to rule out the presence of explosive bubbles in the exchange 
rates of Brazil, Russia, India and China. For South Africa, although the Engle-Granger test 
points to no cointegration, Johansen's test results indicate that the series cointegrate and 
the presence of explosive bubbles is discarded for that country.

4.2. Evans' Periodically Collapsing Bubbles 

We tested the exchange rates of the BRICS for the presence of bubbles consistent 
with the Evans (1991) specification estimating TAR, MTAR, TARC and MTARC models of 
equation (8). Here we report only the results for MTAR and MTARC tests, using the critical 
values in  Enders  and Siklos (2001), because Bohl (2003) shows they  are  more  p owerful 
than  the  TAR  and  TARC  tests.  Recall  also  that  the  difference  between  the  MTAR  and 
MTARC tests is that in the former 𝜏 = 0, while in the latter it is calculated from the series of 
estimated residuals. As will be seen below, both tests arrive at the same conclusion for all 
countries, except India. Table 5 shows the results of the estimation for each country.

For  Brazil  and  Russia,  both  MTAR  and  MTARC  reject  the  null  hypothesis  of  no 
cointegration  (H0: ρ1 = ρ2 = 0)  and  the  hypothesis  of  symmetry  (H0: ρ1 = ρ2)  at  the  5% 
significance level, but the hypothesis  of  absence  of bubbles is not rejected  because  ρ1 is 
positive. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of periodically recurring bubbles.  
 
For  India,  MTAR  and  MTARC  report  different  results.  Since  our  time  series  is  not 
long, the estimate of τ for MTARC may not be accurate, because its consistency relies on 
asymptotic results. Therefore, it will be more convenient the use of the MTAR test. Using 
this  method, the  hypothesis  of no cointegration  and symmetry cannot  be rejected, so the 
hypothesis  of no  existence  of  periodically collapsing bubbles cannot be rejected for India 
and thus, it is accepted. For China and South Africa the hypothesis of no cointegration and 
symmetry  cannot  be  rejected,  so  the  hypothesis  of  inexistence  of  periodically  collapsing 
bubbles cannot be rejected, and is accepted.   

4.3. Intrinsic Bubbles 

To test for the presence of intrinsic bubbles in the exchange rate series we fitted the 
non-linear equation (17) and obtained the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters 
using the methodology in Davidson and MacKinnon (2003) to allow the errors to be AR(1) 
i.e. follow a first order auto-regressive process which was detected in a first stage estimation.  

Namely, 

𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡
(𝑖) = 𝑘(𝑖) + 𝑐𝑖 ∙ (𝐼𝑡
𝐼𝑡

(𝑖))

𝜆−1

+ 𝑢𝑡;    𝑢𝑡 = 𝜌𝑢𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑡,   𝜖𝑡 ∼ 𝑁𝐼𝐷(0, 𝜎𝜖

2) 

The  analysis  of the statistical significance  of  each  parameter  allowed us to  test for 
the  presence  of  this  type  of  rational  bubble.  The  results  are  shown  in  Table  6.  We  find 
significant  positive  values  for  𝑐𝐢  only  for  Brazil,  for  both  models  of  the  fundamental  rate 
(FUND1  and  FUND2),  and  for  India,  for  the  fundamental  rate  FUND2.  The  estimated 
parameter 𝜆̂ − 1 was not significant for any of the countries. Therefore, there is evidence of 
the presence of intrinsic bubbles only for Brazil and India.

The estimated value of 𝑘(𝑖) and the relative price index of the relevant model for the

5.  CONCLUSIONS 

Rational  bubbles  are  present  in  asset  prices  when  persistent  deviations  between  the 
observed  price  and  the  fundamental  rate  which  satisfy  the  fundamental  bubble  dynamic 
equation. This paper tested for the existence of rational bubbles in the exchange rates of 
BRICS countries of three particular types: explosive bubbles, periodically collapsing bubbles 
of the type proposed by Evans (1991), and intrinsic bubbles proposed by Froot and Obstfeld 
(1991).  

Two structural models were used to obtain produce the series for fundamental value 
 
of the exchange rate. One is based on the pure purchasing power parity (PPP) relation and 
the other is  a modified version of that model that included a term to capture the effects of 
the interest differential between the BRICS country and the USA.  

The results of the tests are summarized in Table 7; in the second line it is stated the 
null hypothesis that is being tested. In summary, the tests for explosive bubbles does not 
reject the existence of them for all countries except South Africa. The no rejection does not 
imply the acceptance of existence of explosive bubbles, since other factors may cause the 
absence  of cointegration. There is  no  evidence  of the  presence  of  periodically collapsing 
bubbles of the Evans (1991) type for all the countries in the BRICS group. There is evidence 
of  intrinsic  bubbles  only  for  Brazil,  for  both  models  of  the  fundamental  rate  (FUND1  and 
FUND2), and for India, for FUND 2. Looking at all tests for each country, we conclude that 
for  Brazil  and  India  there  is  evidence  of  the  presence  of  explosive  and  intrinsic  rational 
bubbles (they are either not rejected or present in at least one test), for Russia and China 
only explosive bubbles might exist and for South Africa there is no evidence of any of these 
types of exchange rate bubbles.
