Resumo 

Analisar os diferenciais de rendimentos nas ocupações dos trabalhadores brasileiros é o foco central deste 
trabalho. Em virtude da vasta diversidade de ocupações catalogadas pelo IBGE (cerca de 800), aplica-se 
um  procedimento  teórico  para  reduzi-las  em  apenas  sete  a  fim  de  permitir  tratamento  estatístico  dos 
dados.  São  estimadas  equações  mincerianas  quantílicas,  sobre  as  quais  são  feitas  decomposições  para 
verificar o hiato entre os rendimentos dos indivíduos com atributos inerentes distintos, bem como entre 
aqueles  residentes  em  regiões  mais  e  menos  desenvolvidas  do  país.  Os  resultados  das  estimações 
ratificam a importância da análise desagregada em estratos ocupacionais e por quantis, uma vez que os 
efeitos  das  variáveis  explicativas  são  distintos  ao  longo  das  distribuições  de  rendimentos  e  entre  as 
ocupações. Em relação às lacunas existentes entre as distribuições de rendimentos, verifica-se um glass 
ceiling effect em algumas ocupações, ou seja, a defasagem é maior no topo da distribuição. Entretanto, na 
maioria dos casos, a ocorrência do hiato é maior na base da distribuição – sticky floor effect. Além disso, 
diferente das lacunas entre  gêneros, que são decorrentes  apenas da remuneração às  características dos 
indivíduos (discriminação), os diferenciais de rendimentos entre raças e regiões também decorrem das 
diferentes características dos trabalhadores.

Abstract 

Analyzing the income differentials amongst the Brazilian workers’ occupations is the focus of this paper. 
Due to the wide diversity of occupations cataloged by the IBGE (around 800), a theoretical procedure is 
applied  to  reduce  them  to  only  seven  in  order  to  allow  statistical  treatment  of  the  data.  The 
methodological approach is based on Mincer quantile equations to be estimated in various strata of the 
workers’ income distribution, on which a breakdown is made to check the gap among the individuals’ 
income  with  distinct  inherent  attributes  and  between  those  living  in  both  more  and  less  developed 
regions. The estimation results ensure the importance of breakdown analysis for occupational strata as 
well as for quantiles, since the effects of explanatory variables are distinct along the income distribution 
and vary  among occupations. Regarding the  gaps in this distribution, there is a  glass ceiling  effect in 
some occupations, that is, the gap is greater at the top of distribution. However, in most cases the gap is 
greater at the bottom of the distribution – sticky floor effect. Moreover, contrary to the gap in gender, 
which  is  due  to  the  compensation  characteristics  of  individuals  only  (discrimination),  income 
differentials between regions and races also occur from the heterogeneous characteristics of workers.

1.  INTRODUCTION   

Economic growth and the increase in demand for jobs has generated significant changes in the 
Brazilian job market dynamics. Besides that, the recent phenomenon of income inequality reduction has 
a direct implication for the transformations that have occurred in the market occupational distribution, be 
it transformations in demand, be it supply ones. (BARROS, 2007). 

However,  centuries  old  problems  such  salary  inequalities  between  individuals  who    work  at 
similar activities and also have the same qualifications, are still observable. For instance, the salary gap 

2 

 
between  men  and  women,  between  whites  and  non-whites  and  between  residents  of  more  and  less 
developed regions. In some cases, acquired attributes such as education level and work experience seem 
to have less relevance than a worker’s gender or race. As an illustration to grasp this idea, data from the 
Brazil’s National Household Sampling Survey (PNAD) of 2011 reveals that for individuals 10 years and 
older, the averages of education years of women and men are respectively 7,5 and 7,1, which means a 
5,6% superiority in favor of women. On the other hand, the men’s average monthly earning are 73,7% 
higher than that for women, that is, R$1.129 and R$650, respectively. 

So, it becomes relevant to investigate how education and other personal attributes have affected 
the Brazilian worker. It is also believed to be indispensable such analysis to take into account not only 
distinctions  between  inherent  attributes  and  regionalization,  but  also  differences  among  the  diverse 
occupational categories due to requirements on each of them regarding human capital level.  

On an empirical application of such nature, it is usual to get theoretical support based on Mincer 
equations that spot the effects of explanatory factors on the average variation of the individual worker’s 
income.  Worth  reminding  is  that  the  impact  of  every  factor  can  significantly  vary  among  the  income 
distribution strata. It is expected, for instance, that effects of inherent characteristics such as ethnicity and 
gender,  or  acquired  characteristics  such  as  human  capital  to  differentiate  according  to  occupation  and 
income stratification.  Therefore, the results obtained by applying this methodological technique on non-
stratified samples, which is often applied in literature, produce inconsistent and distorted effects. 

This paper relies on quantile Mincer equations to verify the impact of explanatory variables on 
every earning distribution quantile, allowing for the occurrence of differentiated effects when stratifying 
workers’  income  distribution  by  occupation.  Starting  from  strata,  an  investigation  about  the  lagging 
between  workers’earning  caused  by  gender,  ethnicity  and  region  differences,  according  to  the 
methodology  by  Machado  and  Mata  (2005),  which  expands  the  formulation  of  the  Blinder-Oaxaca 
Decomposition (BLINDER, 1973; OAXACA, 1973). For this purpose, the conditional wage distributions 
of  these  categories  are  estimated  via  quantile  equations,  marginal  distributions  are  obtained,  when 
comparisons are made between the abovementioned categories, they turn possible the decomposition of 
differences in income distributions into two components: one that comes from observable characteristics 
of  workers  and  another  from  the  returns  to  these  characteristics,  which  may  be  interpreted  as 
discrimination.  

The  main  methodological  hurdle  for  the  actualization  of  the  estimations  is  the  considerable 
number  of  more  than  eight  hundred  occupational  categories  designated  by  The  Brazilian  Institute  Of 
Geography and Statistics Foundation (FIBGE) . To overcome such hurdle and make estimations possible, 
it is vital to implement a special handling on the data so as to   create occupation groups and then have a 
statistically-practicable  numbers  that  lead  to  inferences  of  greater  degree  of  freedom  and  accuracy, 
despite the possibility of information loss. 

The  seminal  contribution  to  the  investigation  of  occupational  choices  is  believed  to  have  been 
made by Roy (1951), who identified in such choices, the skills and these skills’ return distribution  for 
every occupation.  In order for a proper continuity of this analysis through the application of adequate 
inference  methods  with  discrete  choices,  some  researchers  suggested  the  grouping  of  those  numerous 
occupational categories in smaller strata.  

One of the earliest proposals was made by Erickson, Goldthorpe and Portocarrero (1979) which 
was later honed by Goldthorpe,  Llewellyn and  Payne  (1987), who designed  a scheme known as EGP 
(named  after  the  initials  of  the  first  authors).  It  is  comprised  of  seven  occupational  classes  and  it  is 
internationally used, including by the CASMIN Project (an acronym for Comparative Analysis of Social 
Mobility  in  Industrial  Nations),  whose  purpose  is  centered  on  the  analysis  of  labor  mobility  in  the 
industrial realities of various European Union  countries.   Later on, many other  grouping formulations 
came up, and all of show similarity to the EGP proposal. Among them, the Vale Silva (1988) formulation 
stands  out,  for  it  incorporates  significant  axes  for  the  identification  of  similarities  and  differences 
between  categories,  such  as  the  dichotomy  between  rural  and  urban  sectors  as  well  as  the  dichotomy 
between  manual  and  non-manual  labor,  so  it  grouped  the  numerous  categories  into  eighteen  sets. 
Nevertheless, such scheme has not been widely used due to its analysis difficulty, so researchers have 
been opting for the implementation of a grouping proposal which contains a lower number of categories.

It is expected that this study will contribute to the debate about this subject when it conducts an 
analysis  of  the  earning  distribution  quantiles  of  every  occupation,  and  by  individual  characteristics,  it 
identifies  the  factors  that  affect  them.  When  using  the  EGP  scheme,  firstly  a  recoding  of  the 
PNAD(Brazil’s National Household Sampling Survey) data is required to effectively group those various 
occupational  categories  into  just  seven  sets,  and  then  an  analysis  of  the  Brazilian  job  market  by 
occupational categories is conducted. Such analysis is approached by the estimation of Mincer quantile 
equations and by identifying   and decomposing the existing hiatus between men’s income and women’s 
incomes,  whites  and  non-whites,  individuals  who  reside  in  the  Northeast  region  or  in  another  more-
developed region (namely the South, the Southeast or the Midwest). Besides verifying the strata in which 
the  applied  explanatory  variables  affect  the  income  distribution,  this  procedure  makes  possible  the 
detection of distortions that may occur between personal attribute effects and  in addition it also detects 
the  existence  of  likely  effects  such  as  glass  ceiling  or  sticky  floor,  as  previously  seen  in  economic 
literature.  Once  the  distribution  strata  that  are  affected  by  each  factor  are  identified,  it  becomes  less 
difficult to implement policies that aim to reduce income inequalities, which leads to the improvement of 
workers’ well-being.  

This article comprises four additional sections. A selective review of the literature is highlighted 
in the next section, followed by a discussion of both the methodology and the results. The last section is 
reserved to the final remarks.  
2.  A  SELECTIVE  REVIEW  OF  LITERATURE:  MINCER  EQUATIONS,  DECOMPOSITION 

OF INCOME DISTRIBUTION AND OCCUPATIONS  

In  the  20th  century,  Schultz  (1961)  and  Ben-Porath  (1967)  formulated,  despite  the  absence  of 
theoretical strictness, the relation between education and income. However, the debates and the empirical 
applications  were  intensified  after  the  publishing  of  the  seminal  article  by  Mincer  (1974),  which 
formalized the theory of the derivation of such relation whose equation specifies the worker’s income as 
a function of his or her formal education and experience acquired on the job. It is worth mentioning, that 
most  applications  use  a  simplified  version  of  the  Mincer  model  in  which  the  rigidity  hypothesis  is 
assumed, that is, returns from education and experience are invariable among individuals.  However, the 
most general of his model, and the most realistic one, acknowledges the possibility of such returns to 
vary among individuals. And that leads to a random-coefficient model (HARMON et al, 2003). So, when 
one stratifies earning distribution as it is done herein, this is the model to be applied. 

In this sense, this paper uses equations which have that methodological structure, despite having a 
focus that differs from the focus usually seen in literature. For each occupational stratus, analyses of the 
Brazilian  workers’  income  distribution  and  of  the  factors  that  cause  changes  in  such  distribution  are 
conducted. Initially, quantile mincerian equations are estimated to investigate the effects of variables like 
education  and  experience  on  the  workers’  income  distribution.  From  these  results,  conditional 
distributions  are  obtained  from  which  in  turn,  the  marginal  ones  will  be  extracted.  Thus,  it  becomes 
possible to decompose the workers’ income distributions into various components.  
 
The first works that contained this kind of analysis were done by Oaxaca (1973) and by Blinder 
(1973),  which  decomposed  the  income  distributions  of  males  and  females  into  a  component  that  is 
attributed to distinct individual characteristics, and into another component derived from the differences 
between the returns to these characteristics. Such decomposition, however, was conducted via the Least 
Squares method (LS), only for the average of the distribution. Later studies applied quantile regressions 
in order to perform such analysis, thus giving information pertaining not only to the income distribution 
center, but also pertaining to the substrata. 
 
A similar procedure was applied by Blau and Kahn (1996) to analyze the income inequalities in 
the  United  States  in  comparison  to  nine  OECD  countries,  with  data  from  the  1980’s.  Through  the 
estimation of the income densities of male workers, the authors concluded that salary inequality in the 
U.S. is greater than in all other OECD countries. However, after disaggregating the income distributions 
into  several  parts,  Blau  and  Kahn  verified  that  inequality  in  the  United  States  is  considerably 
larger/smaller than in other countries in the lower/higher quantiles, respectively.   

4 

 

DiNardo et al. (1996) applied nonparametric methods to measure the effects of institutions and 
the effects of job market factors on the changes of income distribution in the United States from 1979 to 
1988. They concluded that labor unions and supply and demand shocks are vital to the understanding of 
the  income  inequality  rising  in  that  period.  Besides,  they  also  found  evidence  that  the  decline  of  the 
actual  minimum  salary  value  explains  most  of  such  inequality  increase,  especially  due  to  the  gender 
factor. 

Based  on  the  Blinder–Oaxaca  decomposition  by  applying  quantile  regressions,  Albrecht  et  al. 
(2003) found in the Swedish workers’ income distribution what is conventionally named in literature as 
the glass ceiling effect, that is, the  difference in income between men and women is positive, it grows 
along the distribution and  intensifies at the top.   

The technique proposed by Machado and Mata (2005) has been applied in many recent articles. It 
utilizes quantile regressions to identify and decompose gaps between the incomes of different categories 
at different points in time. They applied the method with the purpose of verifying the changes in income 
distribution in Portugal regarding the period from 1986 to1995, and concluded that the changes of the 
individuals’ attributes as well as the returns of such attributes do contribute to the increase of income 
inequality. They also concluded that education contributed in a decisive way to this increase. 

Albrecht et al. (2009) provided with greater theoretical support to the methodology of Machado 
and  Mata  (2005)  by  evidencing  the  asymptoptic  consistency  and  normality  regarding  such  technique, 
besides  taking  into  consideration  sample  selection  adjustments.  The  empirical  application  of  such 
technique aimed to test the hiatus between genders among Dutch workers’ income, and it was then that 
these researchers noticed the presence of a  glass ceiling effect on that distribution. Using these authors’ 
methodology,  Paredes  (2012)  also  analyzes  the  gender  discrimination  in  the  Chilean  economy  by 
grouping up occupations in sets of nine1, and identifies that the income hiatus between men and women 
has been narrowed in categories such as managers, upscale self-employed professionals, and especially 
in  occupations  dealing  with  finances  and  insurance.  Similarly  for  Brazil  and  using  data  from 
PNAD/2007, Coelho et al (2010) have also identified such an effect through the earning distribution gap 
of black and white brazilian women by performing quantile regression with semiparametric correction 
for sample selection bias. Their main finding is that the returns to education are higher at the top of the 
distribution. 

 This work also follows the Methodology of Machado and Mata (2005), but it also verifies the 
changes in the Brazilian workers’ income distributions by occupational groups which has more accurate 
results. So it will benefit policies that aim to reduce salary inequalities as those policies will be designed 
in a more efficient way. 

The studies abovementioned analyze the variations of salary distributions either in a n aggregate 
way  or  considering  gender  differences.  This  research  proposes  an  analysis  that  takes  into  account 
individuals’ different occupations. The most difficult task in researches that focus on this approach is to 
narrow down occupational cathegories due to the high number of disaggregated job specifications. So it 
becomes vital to aggregate them in order to accomplish a practicable analysis, even if that may lead to 
some  information  loss.  Thus,  various  researchers  have  proposed  different  ways  to  aggregate  such 
categories into smaller groups while simultaneously trying to avoid information loss.  

The  first  versions  of  occupational  distribution  were  proposed  by  Erickson,  Goldthorpe  and 
Portocarrero (1979) and improved by Goldthorpe, Llewellyn and Payne (1987), scheme internationally 
known as EGP (first authors’ initials), which is comprised of seven classes. Based on this aggregation, 
occupations  were  then  grouped  in  several  countries  studied  by  the  CASMIN  Project  (Comparative 
Analysis  of  Social  Mobility  in  Industrial  Nations),  which  was  coordinated  by  Goldthorpe  in  the  early 
1980’s. 

This  methodological  scheme  takes  into  account  the  work  relations  between  employers  and 
employees in both rural and urban activity sectors. According Ribeiro and Scalon (2001) the resulting 
classes at the end of the aggregation are classes of comparable individuals in terms of their income level,

financial safety degrees, career-advancement probabilities and these individuals’ autonomy to perform 
work.  

There are other class-aggregation proposals, but all of them share some degree of similarity with 
the proposal by Goldthorpe. Pastore (1979), by proposing that the aggregation of numerous categories to 
be done by forming six groups and that accentuates the heterogeneity of each of them due to the reduced 
number of strata. Aiming to reduce such in-between groups difference, Silva (1988) proposed the use of 
eighteen categories. Silva’s proposal was not used by other researchers as they considered this too high a 
number of categories. The opposite happened to Scalon (1999) who rearranged Silva’s (1988) eighteen 
categories into nine but managed to minimize the loss of information. To achieve this, Scalon applied 
cluster analysis techniques and also a criterion for combining categories based on log-linear models. 

With the goal of verifying which are the determinants of the distinctions in Brazilian workers’ 
earning  distributions,  this  research  uses  the  EGP  scheme’s  theoretical  principle    and  comes  with  a 
recoding  of  the  PNAD  data  about  occupations,  for  it  grouped  more  than  eight  hundred  occupational 
category classifications into just seven as follows: professional managers, routine non-manual laborers, 
small  business  owners,  rural  owners/employers,  skilled  manual  laborers  such  as  technicians  and 
supervisors,  unskilled  manual  laborers,  and  rural-sector  unskilled  manual  laborers.  Opposite  to  the 
analyses usually found in literature, where job market approaches are done in an aggregate fashion, this 
research stands out for its   partitioning of the market by occupational category strata, and that leads to 
inferences that produce more realistic results for more efficient policies.   
3. METHODOLOGY 
 
The  applied  methodology  comprises  two  procedures.  In  the  first  procedure  it  is  measured  the 
returns  to  workers’  education  through  quantile  Mincer  equations  which  were  estimated  for  each 
occupational  stratum.    The  second  procedure  is  a  counterfactual  decomposition  of  workers’  earning, 
taking into account differences of gender, ethnicity and region. The data used and the variables that make 
up the models are to be described in the next sections. 
3.1 Earning Equations 
 
The first empirical exercise is the estimation of earning equations in the traditional way, however 
a little differently as this estimation applies a quantile regression model created by Koenker and Basset 
(1978).  This  way,  a  detailed  analysis  of  workers’  income  distribution  can  be  conducted  and  it  differs 
from the usual application of the LS method in this   kind of investigation which provides only with the 
characteristics of a part of the distribution of the response variable. However, for developing countries 
such as Brazil, where there is a marked  heterogeneity among workers in terms of income and also in 
terms  of  inherent  and  acquired  attributes,  where  the  impact  of  individual  characteristics  on  earnigs  is 
utterly significant, the analysis by quantile regressions is the most suitable one. Equations like these are 
also  used  in  order  to  obtain  the  conditioned  income  distributions  that  are  so  necessary  for  the 
decomposition proposed by Machado and Mata (2005), which is described as follows. 
3.2 Decomposition of Earning Distribution 
 
Counterfactual  decomposition  can  be  understood  as  a  generalization  of  the  Blinder–Oaxaca 
(1973) procedure, that applies the LS method to obtain the estimations of the median of the distribution, 
but with the advantage of using quantile regressions that are modeled on each distribution quantile. This 
technique allows for the decomposition of the differences of income distributions of various categories. 
For  instance,  men  and  women  become  two  components  which  derived  from  differences  between 
observable characteristic distributions ( education, experience,etc ) for genders, and also derived from the 
returns  of  these  characteristics.  Therefore,  decomposition  makes  possible  to  identify  the  existing  gap 
between the incomes of  distinct classes and also to measure how much of this gap is distributed as a 
consequence of characteristics and coefficients. The effect of this may be considered as discrimination 
between categories. This decomposition has some stages to be described as follows.

3.2.1 Conditioned Income Distributions 
 
The  first  phase  of  decomposition  is  to  derive  the  conditioned  income  distributions  which  are 
estimated  through  the  quantile  Mincer  equations.  This  kind  of  equation  models  the  relation  between 

regressors type (𝑧𝑧) – education level, experience, square experience, gender, ethicity, regionalization – in 
the corresponding quantiles of the dependent variable [w = 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(earning)]: 
𝑄𝑄𝑞𝑞(𝑤𝑤|𝑧𝑧)=𝑧𝑧′𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞                                                            (1) 
Where   𝑄𝑄𝑞𝑞(𝑤𝑤|𝑧𝑧),  for 𝑞𝑞∈[0,1],  is  the  conditional 𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡ℎ  quantile  of  the    distribution  of  the  dependent 
variable and 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞 is the 𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡ℎ coefficient vector of the mincerian equation. 
way, 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞  can be estimated by solving this following problem (KOENKER AND BASSET, 1978): 
 ∑
(1−𝑞𝑞)�𝑤𝑤𝑚𝑚−𝑧𝑧𝑚𝑚′𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞�
𝑁𝑁𝑚𝑚:𝑤𝑤𝑚𝑚<𝑧𝑧𝑚𝑚′𝛽𝛽

  As the sample average is the solution to minimizing a residual sum of squares and the median is 
the solution to a sum of absolute values of the residuals ,  the quantile  regression  can be defined as a 
solution to an asymmetric minimization of a weighted sum of the absolute values of the residuals. This 

Despite not having an explicit form, this problem can be efficiently solved by the application of 
linear programming methods and the standard errors can be known by bootstrapping (MARTINS and 
PEREIRA,  2004).  Besides,  Cameron  and  Trivedi  (2009)  emphasize  that  quantile  regressions  become 
robust in the presence of outliers and the absence of normality of the dependent variable, and they do not 
need the existence of the conditional mean to be consistent. These characteristics favor and justify its 
application in numerous economic investigations just like this one.

This simulation procedure characterizes the conditional quantiles for all z, but it does not gives 

After specifying the conditional quantile function, the estimated parameters are used to simulate 

also on the distribution of covariates g(z). Aiming to generate a random sample of the marginal density 

the conditional distribution of w given z, by applying the Probability Integral Transform Theorem : If 𝑌𝑌 
is a continuous random variable with  𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝐹𝐹𝑌𝑌(𝑦𝑦), then, the random variable 𝐹𝐹𝑌𝑌−1(𝑋𝑋),  where 𝑋𝑋 is 𝑈𝑈(0,1), 
has  a  distribution 𝐹𝐹𝑌𝑌(𝑥𝑥),  if    U  is  a  uniformly-distribruted  variable  in  [0,1],  then 𝐹𝐹−1(𝑈𝑈)  has  density 
function 𝐹𝐹F. If  𝑞𝑞1,𝑞𝑞1,…,𝑞𝑞𝑀𝑀  derives from a uniform distributio (0,1), the corresponding M estimations 
of  the  quantiles  of  the  w  condicionals  to   𝑧𝑧𝑚𝑚, 𝑤𝑤�𝑚𝑚≡ {𝑧𝑧𝑚𝑚′𝛽𝛽̂𝑞𝑞}𝑚𝑚=1𝑀𝑀 ,  constitute  a  random  sample  of  the 
(estimated) conditional distribution of the income given  𝑧𝑧𝑚𝑚.  
the w marginal density, once this marginal density depends not only on the conditional function 𝛽𝛽̂𝑞𝑞, but 
w, one can simulate g(z) data lines and, for every 𝑧𝑧𝑚𝑚 line, starting from a distribution 𝑈𝑈(1), simulate a 
random 𝑞𝑞𝑚𝑚 and then form   𝑤𝑤�𝑚𝑚≡𝑧𝑧𝑚𝑚𝛽𝛽̂𝑞𝑞𝑚𝑚′ , which is a simulation of the w density implied by the model. By 
function  𝑄𝑄�𝑞𝑞(𝑤𝑤|𝑧𝑧) with the distribution of s z and q to obtain 𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤�)=∬𝑄𝑄�𝑞𝑞(𝑤𝑤|𝑧𝑧)𝑙𝑙(𝑧𝑧)𝑑𝑑𝑧𝑧𝑑𝑑𝑞𝑞.  

replicating  this  technique  several  times,  it  is  possible  to  simulate  a  random  sample  of  the  desired 
distribution. This procedure is equivalent to numerically integrating the estimated quantile conditional 

Inferring about the gap between the incomes of two categories (e.g. between men and women) 
requires to estimate two marginal densities of earnings: the density function estimated according to the 
women’s  earning  distribution  –  based  on  a  sub-sample  –  can  be  defined  as  the  marginal  distribution 
derived from the model; and the counterfactual density function, which in this case corresponds to the 
men’s  density  function  related  to  the  women’s  characteristic  distribution  (MACHADO  and  MATA, 
2005). 

The procedure to calculate the marginal distribution derived from the model is summarized by 

these steps: 

 

1.  A size-M random sample is generated corresponding to the M estimates of the conditional 

quantiles, from a distribution 𝑈𝑈(1): 𝑞𝑞1,𝑞𝑞1,…,𝑞𝑞𝑀𝑀.

2.  Using data about female individuals, it is then estimated that: 𝑄𝑄𝑞𝑞𝑚𝑚(𝑤𝑤|𝑧𝑧)= 𝑧𝑧′𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞. As a result,  
M estimates for the quantile regression coefficients , 𝛽𝛽̂𝑓𝑓𝑞𝑞𝑚𝑚; where the f  symbol refers to

of  the  estimated  vector  of  coefficients  times  the  generated  size-M  vector  of  covariates: 

where  the  m  symbol  represents  males.  The  difference  of  these  two  density  functions  defines  gender 
discrimination in a given period.   

The counterfactual distribution is calculated according to the procedure above, but, on step 2 , it is

The  described  procedure  conducts  the  investigation  on  the  gaps  between  earning  distributions 
caused by differences of gender, ethnicity  and region. Then, for  every occupational stratum, threefold 
replications of the procedure are required, for every set of the binary characteristics, namely: gender, race 
and region.  
3.3 Database 

The  database  for  the  estimation  of  the  proposed  models  was  obtained  from  Brazil´s  National 
Household  Sampling  Research  (PNAD),  which  is  conducted  yearly  by  The  Brazilian  Institute  Of 
Geography  and  Statistics  (IBGE).  Information  regarding  the  year  2011  was  gathered  (the  most  recent 
period of available data).  
3.3.1 Occupation Definitions 
 
Starting from the theoretical principle of the EGP scheme, a recoding of the PNAD data was done 
so as to aggregate more than 800 occupational categories into just seven which are described as follows:   
1.  Profissional general directors and managers (P.G.D.M.) 

 Legislators,  general  managers  of  government  departments,  operation  and  production  managers, 
bioengineering  professionals,  biotechnology  and  genetic  engineering  professionals,  mechatronics 
engineers, mathematicians, physicists, chemists, architects, doctors, surgeon dentists,  veterinarians ,

operators, office juniors, storekeepers and warehouse keepers, postmen, checkout operators and box 
office staff, receptionists, telephone operators, telemarketers, clerks, pollsters/interviewers. 

3.  Small business owners  (S.B.O.) 

Employers of more than five employees, providing they have declared themselves as employers or 
self-employed individuals: wholesale agents and sales technicians, dry-cleaners, laundry workers and 
similar  kinds  of  professionals,  replenishers  and  retail  associates  responsible  for  markups  and 
markdowns, sales supervisors.  

4.  Skilled manual laborers such as technicians and supervisors (S.M.L.T.S.)

preparation, textile craft, feeders in production lines. 

6.  Rural owners/employers (R.O.E.) 
7.  Rural-sector unskilled manual laborers (R.S.U.M.L.) 

Due  to  the  heterogeneity  among  rural  and  urban  workers,  as  well  as  the  different  work 
environments  in  which  these  two  groups  operate,  the  categories  (6)  and  (7)  were  excluded  from 
sampling. These categories are the ones including rural workers. The purpose of such exclusion was to 
give the analysis the necessary robustness. With the purpose of homogenizing the sample, the northern 

8 

• 

 
workers  were  left  aside,  due  to  certain  socio-geographic  peculiarities  of  the  north  region  that  may 
disguise the urban characteristics of native workers as compared to the other regions of the country.  
3.3.2 Variable Definition 

•   (w) is the main work’s wage logarithm 
• 

For  each  occupational  group  mentioned  in  the  previous  subsection,  quantile  Mincer  equations 
were estimated, and then from these equations, a counterfactual decomposition of wage distribution was 
conceived. The equations were estimated according to the following specification: 

𝑤𝑤𝑚𝑚= 𝛼𝛼+𝛽𝛽1𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚+𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚+𝛽𝛽2(𝑥𝑥𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚)2+𝛽𝛽3𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟ç𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚+𝛽𝛽4𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚+𝛽𝛽5𝑓𝑓𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚+𝛽𝛽6𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚+𝛽𝛽7𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚+𝛽𝛽8𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚+𝑢𝑢𝑚𝑚     (2) 

(ed) are the education years – corresponds to a grade or  a level. For the purpose of equivalence, 
each accomplished passed grade is considered as one education year.  
(xp)  is  the  calculated  experience,  it  conceived  as  age  minus  six,  minus  the  education  years  2. 
When adopting this procedure, it is assumed that all individuals started out their school years at 
the age of six and they do not spend any time outside school in the market (BERNDT, 1991 apud 
KASSOUF, 1998), that is, school-attending individuals do not work. Besides, it is hypothesized 
that the sample accounts for only individuals in the range of 15 – 55 years of age. 
(ETH) is for ethnicity - 1 for whites and 0 for non-whites; 
(GEN) is for gender - 1 for female and 0 for male; 
(MW) represents Midwest– 1 for the midwest region residents and 0, otherwise; 
(NE) Northeast- 1 for the northeast region residents and 0, otherwise; 
(SE) Southeast- 1 for the southeast region residents and 0, otherwise; 
(S) South- 1 for the south region residents and 0, otherwise; 
The descriptive statistics of the variables applied in the model of each occupational category is 
shown  in  Table  1.  The  wide  amplitude  in  the  variations  of  the  continuous  variables  points  for 
heterogeneity  among  the  occupational  categories,  which  in  turn  justifies  the  suitability  of  the 
disaggregation performed. It is worth noting that the low relative representativeness of the small business 
owners category may lead to results that diverge from those of other categories.

In  this  section,  the  results  of  both  proposed  empirical  enterprises  are  presented.  In  the  first 

4 RESULTS 
 
subsection brings the quantile mincerian equations, followed by the earning decomposition.  
4.1  Quantile Mincerian Equations 

The quantile mincerian equations estimates by occupational stratum, as well as by LS are shown 
in Table 2. They reveal that all the coefficients are significant up to a maximum of 5%. In the majority of 

                                                 
2 This procedure was adopted because the PNAD did not have information about individuals’ experience.

the cases, besides differing from the estimation by LS, the effect of the explanatory variables is distinct 
along the distribution of the dependent variable distribution. Such characteristic is statistically proved by 
the Wald Test, whose results are shown in Table 4 of Appendix A. This effect also varies between the 
occupational  strata  and  can  be  easily  seen  on  the  graphs  1–5  of  Appendix  B.  These  graphs,  besides 
showing the results by LS estimation, also evidence the influence of each explanatory variable on the 
dependent quantiles by occupational category.  

The  coefficients  of  education  (ed)  and  experience  (xp)  variables  are  positive  in  all  cases,  with 
stronger effect on the general directors’ and managers’ category (P.G.D.M.) This implies, following the 
literature, that human capital contributes significantly to the increase of workers’ earnings.  It is worth 
emphasizing  that,  except  for  the  unskilled  manual  laborers’  category  (U.M.L.),  the  effect  of  these 
variables  is  greater  at  the  top  of  the  earnings  distribution.  For  the  total  number  of  workers,  a  similar 
effect  was  noticed  in  the  U.S.A.  (Chamberlain,  1994;  Buchinsky,  1994),  Germany  (Fitzenberger  and 
Kurz,  1997),  Uruguay  (González  and  Miles,  2001),  Zambia  (Nielsen  and  Rosholm,  2001),  Portugal 
(Machado and Mata, 2005) and Brazil (Coelho et al, 2010) for a sample of women in the range of 20–60 
years of age. The xp2 variable coefficients measure to what extent additional experience years translate 
into  salary  increases.  This,  in  most  cases,  shows  the  expected  negative  sign,  evidencing  that  at  some 
point the effect of experience on salaries goes null or even negative. In certain points of the distribution 
of some occupational strata, these coefficients differ from what was expected. Although positive, they 
are in fact practically null.  

Gender and ethnicity show a negative-and positive sign coefficients, respectively, in all quantiles 
and occupations, evidencing that if a worker is a female or a non-white person, she or he will get smaller 
earnings. Regarding gender, this result is similar to the result found by Machado and Mata (2005) in their 
study about Portuguese workers.The effects of these variables between the quantiles are distinct in the 
magnitudes of the coefficients between occupations.For the effect is stronger on some of higher quantiles 
while in some others, the opposite is true. 

Inserted  in  the  model  to  detect  differences  in  earnings  variation  between  residents  of 
more-and  less-developed  regions,  the  dummy  variables  proved  to  be  relevant  in  most  of  the 
studied cases. As expected, the negative effects are predominant on the earnings of individuals 
who reside in the least-developed region (the northeast) in almost all quantiles and occupations. 
Except  for  Small  Business  Owners,  on  which  the  null  effect  prevails  in  all  regions,  but 
principally in the southeast, and also income strata whose results might have been derived from 
the homogeneity degree and low sampling representativeness relative to the other occupations.  
4.2 Decomposition of Earning Distribution 

In order to decompose the workers’ earning distribution into two components – a component due 
to  individual  distinct  characteristics  and  another  one  that  comes  from  the  coefficients  (that  is, 
remuneration  to  these  characteristics)  –  the  procedure  described  in  section  3  was  conducted  with  a 
replication number M equals to 1000. The characteristics included were: years of education, experience, 
ethnicity (when conducting decomposition by gender) and gender (when conducting decomposition by 
ethnicity and by region). 

The results of  the decomposition of the gap that exists in-between men’s and women’s income, 
as well as results of the whites and non-whites and workers residing in the northeast region residents in 
comparison to  other regions, by occupational stratum, are shown in table 3. 

Regarding  the  gap  between  the  men’s  income  and  women’s  income,  it  is  clear  that  in  all 
occupational  strata,  the  gap  is  negative  while  it  is  significantly  wider  in  the  unskilled  manual  laborer 
category, where in smaller quantiles, it surpasses 100% mark, and that the proportion originated by the 
characteristics is positive. Therefore, the wage differential has to do with the coefficients, that is, it has to 
do with the  remuneration  given to the individual due to his or her characteristics,  and this means the 
presence of discrimination by gender in the job market. A similar result was verified by Albrecht (2008) 
for the Netherlands and by Arulampalam, Booth and Bryan (2005) for several European countries.

The  gaps  between  whites’  and  non-whites’  incomes  who  reside  in  the  northeast  or  in  another 
region are also negative gaps. Except for the small business owners category, is that there are positive 
gaps in some points of the distribution. Just like in the decomposition by gender, the largest part of these 
lags  come  from  the  coefficients,  which  evidences  the  existence  of  discrimination.  However,  the 
proportion that comes from the workers’ characteristics is also negative. Such fact means that non-white 
individuals who reside in the northeast region have characteristics (years of education and experience) 
that make them get smaller incomes than those of white individuals or individuals who reside in other 
regions.  The  implementation  of  policies  that  promote  social  integration  of  these  categories  becomes 
highly advisable, in the light of the evidences shown herein.   

Graphs  6,  7  and  8  in  appendix  C  generated  by  the  Stata  software  after  the  decomposition 
procedure,  illustrate, for every occupational stratum, the gaps between  the men’s and women’s income 

12 

 
distributions,  as  well  as  between  whites  and  non-whites  and  northeast  residents  and  other  regions, 
coming from the coefficients (discrimination)with a 95% trust interval. Some occupations show a glass 
ceiling effect, that is, the lag is higher at the top of the distribution. That can be observed, for instance, in 
the Professional General Directors and Managers category  (P.G.D.M.), likewise in decompositions by 
gender and by race, where the income hiatus is higher than 19% in the bottom part of the distribution and 
higher than 30% at the top part. However, the incidence of a sticky floor effect is more likely. It is an 
effect whose name was used by Arulampalam, Booth and Bryan (2005) for situations when the hiatus is 
higher in the bottom part of the distribution.In the decomposition by regions, such effect is observed in 
all occupational strata, indicating that discrimination decreases as distribution evolves. 

The results of the decomposition over all of the distribution can be better seen in graphs 9, 10 and 
11, depicted in appendix F. It is clear the hiatus variation between the incomes along the quantiles and 
between  occupations.  In  the  decomposition  by  ethnicity,  for  example,  in  the  category  of  Professional 
General Directors and Managers, the income differential significantly varies along the quantiles and does 
a strikingly distinct trajectory, different from the trajectory seen in the Small Business Owners (S.B.O.) 
category. Facts like these ratify the importance of disaggregated analysis of occupational strata and by 
quantiles.  
 FINAL REMARKS 

By grouping hundreds of occupational categories (as they were characterized by the PNAD/2011 
survey)  into  just  five  categories,  and  also  by  following  the  schematic  EGP  theoretical  principle,  an 
analysis has been conducted herein, of the Brazilian urban job market, by occupational stratum.  

Quantile Mincer equations were estimated to test the effect of inherent and acquired attributes on 
various  quantiles  along  workers’  earning  distribution.  Abiding  by  the  Machado  and  Mata  (2005) 
methodology,  a  decomposition  of  such  distribution  has  been  conducted  in  order  to  verify  the  earning 
differentials  between  men  and  women,  between  whites  and  non-whites,  between  northeast  region 
residents and other regions’ residents.  This procedure made it possible to evidence how much  of the 
difference between these categories’ incomes is caused by distinctions in characteristics (experience and 
education)  and  how  much  of  the  difference  is  caused  by  dissimilarities  in  remuneration  to  such 
characteristics, which conclusively means discrimination.  

The results of the quantile Mincer equations ratify the importance of disaggregated analysis of 
occupational strata by quantiles, once the effects of the explanatory variables are distinct along income 
distributions and do vary between occupations. This suggests an alternative and realistic view of  Mincer 
equations with variable coefficients, especially regarding human capital return.  Variables such as years 
of  education  and  experience,  bring  on  a  growth  effect  on  workers’  wages,  mainly  in  the  Professional 
General  Directors  and  Managers  category.  On  the  other  hand,  regional  variables  show  that  the  wages 
earned by workers who reside in the northeast is smaller, except for the Small Business Owners category. 
Regarding the gaps between men’s and women’s income distributions, between whites and non-
whites, and between northeast-region residents and other-region residents, some occupations display the 
presence of   glass ceiling effect, that is, the lag is bigger at the top of the distribution. However, in most 
cases,  there  is  a  sticky  floor  effect,  meaning  that  the  hiatus  is  bigger  in  the  bottom  part    of  the 
distribution.  In  the  decomposition  by  region,  such  effect  is  observable  in  all  occupational  strata, 
indicating that discrimination decreases as distribution progresses. 

Regarding  the  income  differential  between  men  and  women,  it  is  negative  in  all  occupational 
strata, expressively higher in the Unskilled Manual Laborers category and the proportion derived from 
the characteristics is positive. It shows that wage differential is originated mainly from the coefficients, 
that is, from remuneration to individual characteristics, which evidences discrimination by gender in the 
Brazilian job market. 

Similarly, the gaps between the incomes of whites and non-whites as well as between the incomes 
of  northeast  residents  and  other-region  residents  are  negative.  Solely  in  the  Small  Business  Owners 
category, and on few distribution points, these gaps are positive. These lags are mostly consequential to 
coefficients that indicate discrimination. However, unlike to what happens to gender, the differentials are 
also resultant from these workers’ distinct characteristics. This indicates that non-white individuals and 

13 

 

 
northeast  region  residents  have  characteristics,  such  as  years  of  education  and  experience,  that  cause 
them to get smaller income than the income earned by white individuals  and  residents of other regions. 
This  fact  confirms  the  imperativeness  of  policies  that  foster  aid  and  the  social  integration  of  these 
categories.
