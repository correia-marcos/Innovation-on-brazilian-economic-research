RESUMO 

Os  investimentos  em  pesquisa  e  desenvolvimento  (P&D)  têm  desempenhado  um  papel  fundamental  na 
promoção  de  melhorias  de  produtividade  e  crescimento  econômico.  No  Brasil,  as  atividades  de  P&D  são 
fortemente  dependentes  do  financiamento  público  e,  na  última  década,  houve  uma  tendência  de  queda  nos 
investimentos  em  P&D  no  País.  Este  artigo  explora  os  efeitos  econômicos  do  financiamento  público  de 
investimentos em P&D no Brasil, levando em conta as mudanças na produtividade total dos fatores (PTF) nos 
setores  de  alta,  média  e  baixa  tecnologia.  A  análise  procede  de  uma  estratégia  empírica  em  dois  estágios 
integrados. No primeiro, estimou-se a elasticidade da PTF em relação aos investimentos em P&D. No segundo, 
simulamos uma retirada dos investimentos em P&D e da TFP vinculados ao financiamento público a partir de 
um modelo CGE baseado em P&D, que reconhece a relação fluxo-estoque entre investimento em P&D e capital 
do conhecimento. Sem o financiamento público de investimentos em P&D, as principais conclusões indicam 
um desvio do PIB real abaixo da trajetória de previsão da linha de base, afetando negativamente os mercados 
interno e externo da economia brasileira. Assim, haveria uma mudança na composição setorial do capital do 
conhecimento e investimentos em P&D, com perdas relativas nas indústrias de alta e média-alta tecnologia, 
tornando a base tecnológica do país mais dependente do setor público, especialmente para a educação.

ABSTRACT 

Investments  in  research  and  development  (R&D)  have  played  a  key  role  in  promoting  productivity 
improvements and economic growth. In Brazil, R&D activities are heavily dependent on public funding and, 
in the last decade, there has been a declining trend in R&D investments in the country. This paper explores the 
economics effects of public R&D investment funding in Brazil, taking into account the changes on total factor 
productivity (TFP) in high-, medium- and low-technology sectors. The analysis proceeds from an empirical 
strategy  in  two  integrated  stages.  In  the  first,  we  estimated  the  elasticity  of  TFP  with  respect  to  R&D 
investments. In the second, we simulate a withdrawal of R&D investments and TFP linked to public financing 
from  an  R&D  based  CGE  model,  which  recognizes  the  stock-flow  relation  between  R&D  investment  and 
knowledge capital.  Without public R&D investment funding, the main findings indicate a deviation on real 
GDP  below  the  baseline  forecast  path,  negatively  affecting  both  the  internal  and  external  markets  of  the 
Brazilian  economy.  There  would  be  a  change  in  sectoral  composition  of  knowledge  capital  and  R&D 
investments,  with  relative  losses  in  high  and  medium-high  technology  industries,  making  the  country’s 
technological base more dependent on the public sector, especially for education.

1  Introduction 

The rapid internationalization of production processes and markets over the last five decades has boosted 
the  development  and  diffusion  of  new  technologies  in  the  world,  affecting  production  and  trade  patterns 
(Athreye and Cantwell, 2007; Lam and Shiu, 2010; Mallidis et al., 2012). Production systems are increasingly 
fragmented and globally integrated (Los et al., 2015; The World Trade Organization, 2011). More technology-
intensive economic sectors are growing and gaining participation in the world, leading to the outsourcing of 
activities in general and a rising demand for highly educated workers (Inklaar and Timmer, 2007). In this global 
scenario of accelerated pace of change, R&D investments are recognized as a key piece to influence and change 
the productivity levels and economic growth of a country (Grossman and Helpman, 1991; Jones, 1995; Romer, 
1990). R&D investments can promote the production of knowledge and raise human capital levels (Becker 
1964), generating gains in TFP and expanding physical capital stock.  Evidence indicates that approximately 
65% of productivity growth variance depends on R&D intensity, that is, gross domestic expenditures on R&D 
expressed  as  percentage  of  the  GDP  (Coccia,  2009).  Given  the  recognition  of  these  impact channels  at  the 
national and industry levels, tax incentives, subsidies, public expenditures (e.g., on patents, research projects 
and research institutions) and other forms of public capital support for R&D investments have become most 
popular and recurrent policy instruments in various nations (OECD, 2005). The challenge is to combine these 
policy instruments in order to make a given economic region more intensive in R&D (Ortega-Argilés, 2013).  
Coccia (2009) points out that an R&D intensity rate of between 2.3% and 2.6% would maximize its long-run 
impact on productivity growth. For example, the European Union, the United States and China achieved a rate 
of 1.95%, 2.74% and 2.05% in 2015, respectively  (OECD, 2018). Nevertheless, at a much lower level, the 
Brazilian R&D intensity was 0.69% in 2016  (IBGE, 2017). Even so, this rate is slightly higher than that of 
developing countries such as Mexico (0.52), Argentina (0.61%) and Chile (0.38%) (OECD, 2018).  

In  Brazil,  public  financing  funds  are  still  scarce  to  meet  the  projects  related  to  the  innovation  area  of 
Brazilian  companies  (De  Negri,  2012;  Negri  et  al.,  2009).  In  the  last  two  editions  of  the  Survey  of 
Technological  Innovation  (Pintec),  2011  and  2014,  elaborated  by  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and 
Statistics  (IBGE,  2015a,  2013),  public  capital  represented  the  second  largest  funding  source  for  industrial 
expenditures on internal R&D activities and external acquisition of R&D in Brazil, a position behind inhouse-
resource funding only. There are few empirical studies about the role of public R&D funding in the literature 
(Avellar, 2009; Avellar and Alves, 2008; De Negri, 2012; Kannebley Jr and Porto, 2012; Kannebley Júnior et 
al., 2016; Negri et al., 2009; Taveira et al., 2019). However, no applied research stresses the long-run economic 
repercussions of this policy instrument in Brazil. This type of analysis of impact on the overall economy is a 
complex task because requires a theoretical framework on knowledge stock and R&D investment (Bor et al., 
2010). Our paper contributes to filling this gap and analyzes the economic deviations of public R&D funding 
from the Brazilian  baseline forecast path  up to 2025. To do so, our research simulates a withdrawal of R&D 
investments financed by public capital and the resulting effect on the TFP of the Brazilian economy, which may 
be  observed  between  2011  and  2016.  To  accomplish  this  task,  we  propose  an  articulation  between  an 
econometric model and dynamic R&D-based CGE (computable general equilibrium) model. Both models are 
pioneers  and  contribute  to  the  literature  highlighting  the  estimated  TFP  elasticity  associated  with  R&D 
investment,  as  well  as  the  role  of  public  R&D  funding  in  Brazil.  Besides  this  introduction,  this  paper  is 
comprised of five other sections. The second section briefly reviews previous research on R&D, productivity 
and  public  funding,  presenting  some  CGE  studies.  The  third  section  describes  the  econometric  model  and 
dynamic R&D-based CGE model, namely, the BIM (Brazilian Intersectoral Model). In turn, the fourth section 
covers the results of shock and the forecast of changes in the macro economy and sectoral structure over the 
next fifteen years. The sixth section presents the conclusions and remarks of the research.  

 

2  R&D, productivity and public support

From the endogenous growth models, R&D investments have been incorporated as one of the factors that 
determine the productivity of the primary factors (Diao et al., 1999; Jones, 1995; Romer, 1990). Since R&D 
activity is one of the main channels of knowledge production, it can change the technical coefficients and the 
capital-labor  ratio,  generating  technical  efficiency,  expanding  the  physical  capital  stock  and  reducing 
production unit costs for an economic activity (Bor et al., 2010). The literature about R&D and productivity is 
broad and indicated that R&D has a significant and positive effect on output growth, but with differentiated 
estimated R&D elasticities by sectors or nations, according to the detailed review of Ortega-Argilés (2013). A 
literature review of the period between 1969 and 2003 provides evidence that the estimated output elasticity of 
R&D varies from 0.05 to 0.60 for studies using individual firms, and from zero to 0.50 for sectoral studies, 
with a central tendency that ranges from 0.10 and 0.20 (CBO, 2005). In general, these econometric approaches 
assume  a  typical  production  function  with  quantities  of  the  factors  of  production  and,  after  estimation,  the 
residual  portion,  which  underlies  Solow’s  (1957)  productivity  residual,  could  be  regressed  against  the 
knowledge stock, an intangible asset. This approach began with Coe e Helpman  (1995) and was applied to 
other empirical models (Adams, 1990; Krammer, 2014; Nishioka and Ripoll, 2012; O’Mahony and Vecchi, 
2009).  

On the other hand, several studies are turning to static and dynamic CGE models to analyze the economic 
effects of public R&D policy instruments and the relationships between knowledge development and economic 
growth (Bor et al., 2010; Bye et al., 2011, 2009; De and Ghosh, 2002; Diao et al., 1999, 1998; Ghosh, 2007; 
Hong  and  Lee,  2016;  Křístková,  2013;  Zürn  et  al.,  2007).  This  category  comprises  CGE  models  based  on 
Romer’s (1990) endogenous growth theory, which associated knowledge capital and  R&D investment. The 
concern of applied research is to explore the direct and indirect channels of production and consumption links 
established  by  the  theoretical  and  data  framework  of  the  CGE  models.  In  general,  most  studies  have 
implemented CGE models with the explicit recognition of knowledge capital as an additional primary factor, 
so that changes in TFP explain the performance of the economy better than standard CGE models (Hong et al., 
2014). This inclusion of knowledge capital prevents the effects of R&D investments on productivity from being 
overestimated (Meriküll et al., 2013).  Already CGE models in their recursive dynamic version have been used 
to evaluate policy effects on the baseline forecast path of an economy. In these types of modeling, knowledge 
capital is accumulated temporally according to R&D investments by a new perpetual inventory method, in which 
the allocation of R&D investment follows the logic of Tobin’s Q.  For example, Ghosh (2002) analyzed the 
effects of direct subsidies and commercial incentives on TFP. Bor et al. (2010) examined the impacts of public 
R&D investment and TFP  on the Taiwanese economy.  Hong and  Lee  (2016) used  a  knowledge-based  CGE 
model to analyze the effects of tax credits on R&D investment according to firm  size in  the South  Korean 
manufacturing industry. 

3  Empirical strategy 

  Our analysis of the public R&D funding policy in the Brazilian economy proceeds in two stages. In the 
first  step, a  residual  TFP  function  is estimated  as a  measure  of  technical  efficiency  gains  against  industrial 
R&D  investments  in  Brazil  between  2010  and  2016.  At  this  stage,  our  innovation  lies  in  computing  this 
information  for  the  67  economic  sectors of  the  Brazilian  economy  annually  and  based  on  the  tables  of  the 
System  of  National  Accounts  (SNA)  of  IBGE  and  the  gross  fixed  capital  formation  matrix  or  capital  flow 
matrix  (CFM)  estimated  by  Miguez  (2016),  whose  version  was  update  by  Miguez  and  Freitas  (2019).  The 
estimated TFP elasticity of R&D investment is used to simulate productivity losses in a scenario with absence 
of R&D investment associated with public funding in the second stage. Thus, both TFP changes and reduction 
in R&D investments will be political shocks in a dynamic CGE model. This two-step integration allows us to 
consider some spillover effect underlying R&D activities in the CGE model. This model follows some applied 
studies  (Bor  et  al.,  2010;  Hong  et  al.,  2014;  Křístková,  2013).  Our  present  model  does  not  capture  the 

 

innovation  and  productivity  spillover  from  R&D  activities,  but  such  strategy  between  the  CGE  and 
econometric models partly mitigates such deficiency. However, this empirical articulation allows to treat the 
links between R&D investments and TFP changes explicitly. Moreover, we can compare the impact of TFP 
and R&D investments in Brazil up to 2025.

3.1  The estimation model 

In order to obtain the relationship between technology and R&D investments in the Brazilian economy, 
we  initially  adopt  a  typical  Cobb-Douglas  production  function,  in  which  only  the  supply  of  the  production 
factors is exogenous in relation to the productive process in the short-term. In this function, the technology 
represents a residual contribution to production and it is not measured by primary factors (Solow, 1957). That 
is,

where 

  is  the  output  of  sector 

  in 

; 

and 

  are  the  capital  and  labor 

employed in production, respectively; and 

 and 

are the elasticities of capital and labor, respectively. The 

term 

  is  a  technology  index  (TFP),  which  encompasses  other  latent  factors  in  the  production  function. 

Taking  logarithms  and  defining  TFP  as  a  measure  of  effects  in  total  product  caused  by  technological 
improvements, equation (1) can be redefined as:

the second stage, this residual portion (

of Krammer (2014) and Messa (2015) considering a panel data structure. For the estimation of equation (2), 
we  adopted  the  fixed  effects  model,  which  controls  for  fixed effects  at  the  sector  level;  that is,  it  does  not 
require that the explanatory variables be uncorrelated with the effect not observed (term). The estimation of 
equation (3) was also performed by fixed effects. The underlying assumption is that the R&D investment effect 

has a contemporary effect on TFP. Nevertheless, the idiosyncratic error

 was tested to verify the presence 

of serial correlation. 

 

The measure of the output (

IBGE’s System of National Accounts (SNA)2 and deflated for the year 2010. Labor (

perpetual inventory method, taking into account the CFM estimated by Miguez and Freitas (2019). For this, 
we compute the gross rate of return on capital and the annual depreciation rate with data on gross fixed capital 
formation (GFCF), without R&D, gross operating surplus (GOS) and  capital stock provided by the Institute 
for  Applied  Economic  Research  (Ipea,  2017).  In  2010,  the  gross  rate  of  return  on  capital  was  20%  for  all

(GFCF)  according  to  the  new  asset  boundary  (including  intellectual  property  products),  and  as  a  product  in  the  intermediate 
consumption matrix and the production of the R&D activity. The availability of this R&D information is limited until the year 2016 
and, therefore, the data for the other variables in the two-stage econometric model are restricted to this time interval (2010 to 2016).

sectors, i.e., this rate to capital was calculated as the ratio of GOS relative to initial capital stock. The sectoral 
composition in GOS is different from that of the CFM of Miguez and Freitas (2019).  

On the other hand, R&D expenditures  are divided between  public and private. The total public R&D 
output3 is defined as non-mercantile (or intangible asset) and exclusively absorbed by the GFCF. In turn, the 
private R&D output is classified between mercantile and non-mercantile. The mercantile share is absorbed by 
intermediate input-output, whereas the non-mercantile output is also allocated to GFCF (IBGE, 2015). In the 
SNA, the annual average of the non-mercantile portion was only 6% of the total Brazilian R&D output between 
2010 and 2016. Moreover, the Pintec provides information on net sales revenue, as well as on the expenditures 
on internal R&D activities and external acquisition of R&D by the main private sectors. In order to make the 
sectoral distribution of private R&D investments feasible and to evaluate the consistency of information, we 

elaborated  two  vectors  for  each  year:

,  where  the  coefficient 

  is  obtained  by  dividing  R&D 

expenditures in relation to  net sales revenue,  both from the Pintec;

, where 

 is computed from the 

ratio between private R&D output and total output for all sectors of the SNA.  

When sectorally compared, the coefficients in these two vectors are very close. Only Petroleum Refining

and Biofuel activities presented positive coefficients in vector 
these two positive coefficients because they are traditionally R&D-intensive economic activities in the country. 
Two sectoral coefficients were added within 
, which presented a higher level of sectoral detail 
and, therefore, was more heterogeneous internally. The real value of private R&D investment was, therefore, 
distributed according to the sectoral structure of a vector of elements originally calculated by weighting the 
coefficients of 

and the total output of each activity.

3.2  The CGE model 

Our  study  developed  a  computable equilibrium  model  capable  of  analyzing  the  effects  of  investment 
policies  on  the  Brazilian  economy.  The  model  was  named  R&D-based  BIM  and  extends  the  theoretical 
specification of capital accumulation and the relationship between the rate of return on capital and investments 
of the Orani-RD model. Capital stock is decomposed between physical and knowledge capital, which present 
a  lagged  adjustment  to  the  respective  investments.  We  are  assuming  a  one-year  gestation  lag.  In  the  main 
mechanism of recursive dynamics, there is a new stock-flow relation between R&D investment and knowledge 
capital, similarly to Bor et al. (2010) and Hong and Lee (2016). In addition, investors produce new units of 
physical and knowledge capital demanding input in different ways, whose data structure is derived from the 
distinct investment allocation behavior in the CFM of Miguez and Freitas (2019). 

3.2.1  Theoretical framework  

The demand behavior of the producers, investors, and typical household represents a nested structure by 
assigning the assumption of weak separability (Dixon et al., 1982). Figure 1 depicts this nested structure. At 
the  top  level  of  the  production  structure  (Figure  1a),  industries  produce  one  or  more  goods  demanding 

intermediate inputs composites 

 and added value composites 

 in fixed proportions.  At the second 

level, all the composites are derived from a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function aggregation. Each 
intermediate  input  composite  is  formed  by  an  imperfect  substitution  (Armington,  1969)  depending  on  the 

relative  prices  between  domestic

 

and  imported  inputs

.  The  value  added  consists  of  an aggregate 

formed from the imperfect substitution via price between labor 

, land 

, physical capital 

 and 

knowledge capital 

. Thus, in both types of composites, changes in the relative prices among primary

factors or between intermediate inputs induce imperfect substitution in favor of relatively cheapened inputs 
(cost-minimizing assumptions). This nested structure of two-level production is defined by:

the proportions of inputs and primary factors may vary among them. 

   

Figure 1 – Main theoretical nested structures 

Figure 1b shows the forms of capital creation. The inputs used for capital creation are also subject to the 
investor’s cost-minimization problem. Similarly to the production structure, investors  combine intermediate 
input  composites  by  a  Leontief  function  at  the  first  level.  In  each  composite,  a  CES  function  controls  the 
arrangement of domestic and imported inputs. As in Hong et al. (2014), the investor uses only the domestically 
, because imported R&D is absent in the BIM database. 
produced R&D to create knowledge capital 

 

Public  activities  demand  their  own  R&D  output  to  create  knowledge  capital,  whose  specification  is  in 
accordance with IBGE (2015). Yet, no primary factors are used directly as inputs for the formation of physical 
and  knowledge  capital.  The  requirements  for  production  factors  are  recognized  in  the  value  added  of  the 
productive  suppliers  of  physical  investments  and  R&D,  respectively.  The  structure  of  investments  is 
determined as:

In the main recursive mechanism of the model, physical 

 and R&D

in  the  capital  accumulation  function  by  a  conventional  perpetual  inventory  method  with  constant  rate  of 
depreciation:

Both capital-accumulation methods are similar. The allocation of investments proceeds by following the 
logic of Tobin’s Q (Hong et al., 2014), So, the expected rate of return is a positive function of the ratio between 

the unit rental price and the unit asset price of capital, i.e.,  

.  Thus, in a logistic function, 

7 

the gross rate of growth of each type of capital in the next period is defined by: 
 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(7) 

in which 

 is the growth trend of capital stocks in the economy, 

represents an exogenous term, so that 
 

it limits a maximum value for the gross rate of  capital growth next period: 

; 

is an 

 

investment elasticity; and 

 measures the relation between the expected rate of return 

 and the normal 

rate of return 

 of capital j for investor I; that is, 

. Thus, the growth rate of capital j 

in sector i 

 

will exceed its respective growth trend 

 if, and only if, the expected rate of return 

 surpasses the investor’s normal rate of return

. This circumstance is verified mainly in the short-

term  (Dixon  and  Rimmer,  2002).  The  structure  enclosed  by  a  dotted  box  in  Figure  1  establishes  the  link 
between the growth rate of each capital stock and corresponding investment, which is guided by rates of return.  
In  turn,  households  determine  an  optimal  composition  of  their  consumption  “baskets”  from  a  linear 
expenditure system (LES) derived from  Klein-Rubin (1947), subject to a budget constraint (see Figure 1c). 
The LES function is mathematically expressed as: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(8) 

where 

is the total demand for the good 

 
 is a residual of the consumer’s budget and identifies product i as a ‘luxury’ or ‘supernumerary’ good, 

represents expenditures on necessary goods (subsistence); 

; 

which varies according to consumer income; and 

denotes the share of this residual allocated to each luxury 

good relative to total luxury expenditure — the marginal budget shares. The demand for luxury goods depends 
on household income and the relative prices of the products, affecting the scale of consumers’ utility function. 
Households also act rationally in the choice between domestic and imported goods through a CES technology. 
Finally, the model assumes the small economy hypothesis in international trade, meaning that changes 
in the Brazilian foreign trade do not influence international prices. The export demand is inversely related to 
that traditional commodity's price with constant exchange rate, but it is positively affected by the exogenous 
expansion of international income.  Government demand is exogenous, and it may or may not be associated 
with household consumption or tax collection. Inventories are accumulated according to production variation. 
Finally,  there  is  a  lagged  adjustment  process  in  the  labor  market,  between  real  wage  growth  and  national 
employment  supply.  Therefore,  we assume  that  while  employment  is  above  its  forecast  level  due  to  policy 
shocks,  the  real  wage  rate moves  further and  further  above its  forecast  level.  This suggests  that  the  shocks 
which are unfavorable to labor produce short-term decreases in employment and long-term decreases in real 
wages (Dixon and Rimmer, 2002).

change form and in deviations from an initial solution – Johansen type (Johansen, 1960). In its dimensions, 
there  are  67  sectors  which  produce  one  or  more  commodities  using  as  inputs  domestic  and  imported 
commodities and  five primary factors (i.e., labor, land, physical capital and knowledge capital). The model 
also contains other representative agents – 65 investors, one household type, government, foreign consumer 
and inventories. There are 4 margins, split between one retail trade and three freight transport services (road, 
rail, and waterway). These margins are required proportionally for each market transaction (the movement of 
a commodity from the producer to the purchaser). The costs of the margins and indirect taxes are included in 
purchasers’  prices  but  not  in  basic  prices  of  goods  and  services.  The  core  database  is  based  on  the  2010 
Brazilian Input–Output Matrix (IBGE, 2010). The database shows that, in 2010, the R&D product accounted 
for 0.53% of the total production and 52.47% of the total R&D output came from the public sector. The R&D 
product sells about 94% of its output to investment (not mercantile) and 6% to intermediate consumption. The 
country does not import R&D. 

Some behavioral parameters were calibrated according to the CGE models of Domingues et al. (2014) and 
Betarelli Junior & Domingues (2014). The steady state was defined as 2.4%, whose rate represents the average 
annual growth of capital stock between 2000 and 2016. We assumed a knowledge capital depreciation rate of 
15%, which is similar to some studies (see Nadiri and Prucha 1996; Hong et al. 2014). Zawalińska, Tran, & 
Płoszaj (2018) conclude that R&D stock depreciation rates are at least two times higher than those of physical 
capital. For a knowledge capital depreciation rate of 15% and steady state of 2.4%, the trend ratio between 
R&D investment and knowledge capital stock was 17.4%, with the gross rate of return on R&D investments 
being about 20%, with a net rate of return of 5%. Following Nishioka & Ripoll (2012) and Krammer (2014), 
the initial knowledge capital stock was estimated by dividing sectoral R&D investments by the sum between 
depreciation rate and average growth rate of real investment. Lastly, the ratio of physical investments relative 
to physical capital stock was 8.3%, resulting in a depreciation rate of almost 6% with steady state of 2.4% as 
well. Given that the physical investments and the gross operating surplus (GOS) associated to physical capital 
presented distinct sectoral structures, the gross rate of return oscillated up to 20% across industries.  

4  Closure, policy analysis and results 

Recursive dynamic models produce sequences of annual solutions linked by dynamic mechanisms such 
as physical capital  accumulation. Policy  analysis represents the comparison of two alternative sequences of 
solutions.  The  first  sequence  is  created  without  policy  change  and  presents  a  base  forecast  for  the  future 
(baseline closure). The other sequence has policy change in place. Thus, baseline projection serves as a control 
path from which deviations are measured in evaluating the impacts of the policy shock  (Dixon and Rimmer, 
2002). Figure 2 depicts these differences and sequential solutions from the baseline and policy simulations. 
Historical  (observed)  and  forecasting  simulations  form  the  baseline  scenario  (i.e.  reference  scenario).  Our 
policy simulations are applied between 2011 and 2016. Since all the investments were simulated in the baseline, 
we implemented a policy of cuts in those private R&D investments linked to public financing with effects on 
TFP. Therefore, we have the effects of the policy change as deviations in the economic variables of the baseline 
scenario. This type of policy simulation offers two analytical perspectives. First, this analysis indicates what 
would have been the positive effect of public policy for the Brazilian economy to reach the reference scenario 
until  2025.  This  positive  effect  on  an  economic  variable  is  given  by  the  difference  between  historical  and 
forecast baseline and baseline without public funding (Figure 2). Second, the analysis presents also the negative 
deviations of the economic variables in relation to the baseline that were caused by the cuts in private R&D 
investments associated with public financing. Both cases present a reciprocal way of quantifying the role of 
public R&D funding in Brazil.  In summary, if we are evaluating the negative deviation from the baseline, we 
are also pointing out the positive effect of the same policy to raise the reference baseline. We chose to present 
the second way of analysis, that is, the negative deviations of the policy from the scenario.

Moreover, in the baseline closure, we assumed that the main macroeconomic aggregates are exogenous, 
such as real GDP, investment, household consumption, government demands, export volume and aggregate 
employment.  This  choice  is  necessary  to  accommodate  observed  and  forecast  variations  in  these 
macroeconomic  indicators.  Conversely,  some  macro  variables  are  swapped  and  endogenous  (shift  in  final 
demand, national wage and TFP). Variables of corresponding normal rates of return are also endogenous to 
accommodate observed changes on physical and R&D investments. The observed and forecast shocks to the 
main macroeconomic indicators in the baseline scenario are reported in Table 1.

The  observed  data  comprise  IBGE  SNA  statistics.  Changes  in  import  prices  are  obtained  from  the 
Foundation for Foreign Trade Studies Center (Funcex) for the years 2011 to 2016. In 2017, physical investment 
and R&D are the same as aggregate investment, as the SNA Tables for 2017 will only be announced by the 
end  of  2019.  The  forecasts  for  the  macroeconomic  scenario  follow  the  BNDES  forecast  report  (2018).  In 
general,  the  macroeconomic information shows  that  in  the  2011-2016  period, there  was  a  slowdown  in the 
Brazilian  economy,  with  sharp  declines  in  domestic  demand  components  in  2015,  such  as  household

consumption,  investments  and  government  expenditures.  In  the  same  period,  exports  started  to  register 
significant growth, when compared with those of 2014. This recessive scenario should be maintained between 
2016 and 2018 and the recovery is expected after this period. Exporting sectors will be the first to recover due 
to  the  scenario  projected  for  the  Brazilian  economy.  Productive  activities  which  are  highly  dependent  on 
internal market dynamics must face slower recoveries until 2025. 

Physical and R&D investment paths were similar to the aggregate investment between 2011 and 2016. 
Public R&D participation was increasing and relatively higher than private R&D, reaching 64.5% in 2016, an 
increase  of  9  percentage  points    (p.p.)  in  relation  to  2011  (Figure  3).  Despite  this  greater  share  in  R&D 
composition, the real expansion of the public sector was only of 1.5% between 2011 and 2016. Private R&D 
decreased almost 31% in the same period, and its fall affected the Brazilian R&D intensity by 0.69%, i.e., a 
decline  of  0.16  p.p.  when  compared  with  2011.  Thus,  the  technological  base  of  innovative  companies  has 
retracted in the country, evidencing that public R&D funding can be an alternative to reverse this declining 
trajectory. For the United States, for example,  Goel et al. (2008) indicated a larger role of federal R&D relative 
to  non-federal  R&D  in  growth.  When  we  analyze  public  R&D  expenditures  in  the  last  two  editions  of  the 
Pintec (2011 and 2014), it can be observed that it accounted for 13.8% of the total private R&D in Brazil. The 
manufacturing industry is the sector that received public funding the most (15.1%) in the 2012-2014 triennium, 
followed by service activities (9.5%). Overall, industrial sectors often occupy an important role in the economy 
for some reasons. First of all, their greater capital intensity allows greater potential for productivity gains due 
to the technology absorption incorporated in new machines and equipment. Second, industrial activities are 
seen as a key source of innovations for the productivity of other sectors, despite the growth of certain services 
as innovation sources. Finally, this type of sector is traditionally perceived as a source of higher quality jobs 
and  lower  turnover,  which  enables  the  development  of  specific  human  capital  with  a  positive  impact  on 
productivity (Messa, 2015).

These public financing shares in relation to the total R&D expenditures of the last two editions of the 
Pintec (2011 and 2014) were used to elaborate policy shocks. To do so, after a correspondence with the 67 
productive sectors of the BIM model, a simple weighted mean of the participation of public financing and the 
R&D investment by the private sector was calculated. This weighting calculation allowed the investment value 
to be associated only with public financing in each year. Given that the 2014 Pintec provides values declared 
in the last year of the triennium, we assigned the share of public funding in 2012 and 2013 as being an average 
of those observed in the 2011 and 2014 Pintec. In 2015 and 2016, there was the same percentage reported in

the 2014 Pintec. Table 2 displays the annual variations in R&D investment made from public financing by 
activity,  highlighting  technological  intensity  following  OECD  (2011)  criteria.  High  and  medium-high 
technology-intensive sectors were those most demanding of public financing between 2011 and 2016, with an 
annual  average  of  15.6%.  These  are  industrial  activities  with  the  largest  participation  in  private  R&D 
investments in 2016 (10.6%). On the other hand, knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) showed a 10% 
public contribution for R&D investments, being the second most representative of the private R&D distribution 
in the Brazilian economy. We simulate a policy shock of falling private R&D investments in proportion to the 
public  funding  shortfall,  considering  that  the  domestic  R&D  product  is  associated  exclusively  with  the 
formation of knowledge capital in the CGE model, without a close substitute. The portion of public funding 
used includes all current policies in Brazil: Innovation Law (Law 10.973 / 2004) and the Law of Good (Law 
No. 11,196 / 2005) Brazilian National Research Council (CNPQ), venture capital programs from the Brazilian 
Development Bank (BNDES) and the Brazilian Innovation Agency (FINEP). 

 

Table 2 –R&D investments and public funding share 

 

 

Therefore, it is expected that KIBS, high and medium-high technology-intensive industries, as well as 
its productive suppliers, will be the ones most impaired by the cut of public financing in private R&D. These 
values  will  represent  the  reduction  shocks  on  private  R&D  investment  in  policy  closure  between  2011  and 
2016. A closure swap was made, that is, the R&D investment variable became exogenous to receive the policy 
shock and normal rate of return variable became endogenous. The reduction of private R&D investments due 
to the absence of public financing has a negative effect on TFP in the Brazilian economy. In this variant, our 
study estimated the equation (2) to obtain TFP residual or the not observed effect (first stage), whose variable 
is  then  regressed  against  R&D  investments  (second  stage),  according  to  equation  (3).  Both  stages  were 
estimated by fixed effects at the economic sector level. Table 3 provides the results of this 2-stage econometric 
model  with  the  Durbin-Watson  test  statistics  modified  by  Bhargava  et  al.  (2006)  and  Baltagi-Wu  statistics

this, equation (3) was estimated  by (within) fixed effects, assuming that the disturbances follow an AR (1) 
process.

The result found indicates a TFP elasticity of 0.015 with respect to R&D investments (Table 3), which 
is well below the rate found in developed countries. Based on estimates for sectoral data, Bartelsman  (1990) 
estimated the R&D elasticity as ranging from 0.11 to 0.15 in the 1958-1986 period for the US, whereas Coe 
and Helpman (1995) found an elasticity of 0.23 for G7 countries. The elasticity for the Brazilian economy is 
closer  to  estimates  for  OECD  countries  not  participating  in  the  G7,  which  was  estimated  at  0.08  (Coe  and 
Helpman, 1995), or earlier estimates for Australia, for which elasticity was estimated to be 0.02 in the 1975-
1991 period, according to the Australian Industry Commission (1995) report. On average, our estimation result 
is within the estimated range in these studies. The estimated elasticity in our paper will be weighted by the 
negative variation of private R&D investments in a scenario of absence of public  financing. This percentage 
will be simulated as TFP effect for each activity sector. For that, the shocks were applied in the technological 

variable 

of equation (4) between 2011 and 2016, as in Křístková (2013). So, GDP movements depend both 

on changes in the TFP itself and on changes in capital stock and employment, which in turn depend on many 
factors apart from changes in R&D stock. 

 

4.1  Results 

Figure 4 illustrates the main causal relationships underlying the aggregate results of the model. According 
to the structure of the model, without public R&D funding, investors would find greater constraints to produce 
new units of knowledge capital. Lower R&D investment demand generate a direct reduction in the output of 
R&D-producing activities. Accordingly, the input requirement per unit of output decreases, causing a negative 
impact  on  the  primary  factors  and  prices  of  intermediate  inputs  in  the  economy.  Given  the  possibility  of 
substitution among the primary factors, the cut in public development would alter relative prices, leading to a 
shift  in  demand  toward  the  relatively  cheaper  primary  factor.  Moreover,  investors  foresee  potential  lower 
returns and household income and consumption are lower. Nevertheless, production costs generate a reduction 
in  the  prices  of  composite  commodities, transmitted  by  sectoral  interdependencies  (price  effect).  In  a  cost-
competitiveness approach, some producers become more competitive (production costs go down), encouraging 
the  external  demand  especially  –  which  requires  more  intermediate  inputs  and  primary  factors  and,  thus,

reasonably pushes up input prices. Labor-intensive and/or traditionally exporting activities would start to sell 
more abroad, mitigating the initial negative effect on internal demand. Again, these certain positive effects are 
transmitted  to  other  markets  of  the  economy  (activity  effect),  with  the  increase  in  production  costs  being 
reinforced by TFP in R&D-demanding activities, because the productive processes begin to require relatively 
more primary factors per unit of output (i.e., the unitary cost declines with the expansion of production). The 
competitiveness  of  domestic  products  in  the  economy  decreases.  Therefore,  the  productive  inefficiency 
associated  with  cutting  private  R&D  investments  affects  not  only  the  internal  market,  but  also  long-term 
external demand.

Table  4  provides  the  deviations  from  the  main  macroeconomic  indicators  provided  by  the  policy  in 
relation to the baseline forecast, considering the separate effects of the absence of public R&D funding and the 
subsequent withdrawal on TFP. The absence of public R&D funding and the reduction in associated TFP have 
a  negative  impact  on  the  GDP  growth  rate  between  2011  and  2016,  slowly  decelerating  over  time.  The 
declining in the time path of deviations in the GDP and other macroeconomic variables is due to the lagged 
movement of the real wage and the capital stock (e.g., Figure 5, Panel a). Together, both simulations led to a 
shrinkage of -0.56% of the GDP between 2011 and 2016, accumulated at -0.69% by 2025. The effect of the 
loss of productive efficiency is more perverse on the country’s economic activity (-0.45%), representing almost 
65%  of  the  total  negative  effect  in  the  long-term.  The  trajectory  of  deviations  generated  on  household 
consumption  is  similar  to  that  of  the  GDP,  since  negative  changes  in  aggregate  real  income  would  affect 
household  consumption  according  to  the  proportion  of  this  expenditure  component.  By  2025,  the  negative 
deviation  on  the  growth  rate  of  household  consumption  would  total  0.75%.  As  households  maximize  their 
utility by expanding their consumption basket, a policy of cutting public funding with the adverse TFP effect 
generates a decrease in welfare (Table 4). The negative deviation in the utility of households was, on average, 
1.42% below the baseline forecast path in 2025. As the productive activities no longer obtain the TFP gain 
related to R&D investments from public financing, unitary production costs expand and, consequently, there 
is an upward pressure on the economy’s domestic prices, affecting both external and internal markets in the

long-term. The trade balance registers a marginal reduction of 0.72% due to the TPF effect. According to the 
contribution of each market to expenditure-side real GDP, the expansion of the external market resulting from 
the  absence  of  public  R&D  funding  is  lower  than the  negative  effect  generated  by  productive  inefficiency, 
resulting in a total deviation of -0.02% in the long term (2025). The negative impact on the internal absorption 
components of output is softened by the growth of the external demand. The export volume grows because of 
the decline of the GDP deflator over the years.

By the competitiveness-cost approach, external demand is negatively related to the behavior of domestic 
prices and, therefore, generalized cost reductions stimulate a growth rate of exports above the baseline forecast 
path. Moreover, given the production complementarity and the possibility of imperfect substitutability between 
domestic  goods  and  the  imported  equivalent,  negative  deviations  from  domestic  prices  would  reduce  the 
volume of imports, with an accumulated deviation of about -0.28% in 2025. Hence, the trade balance presents 
a negative deviation by 2025, but the terms of trade decline. These  results suggest that the difference in the 
effects of exports and imports generate savings in the economy due to the need to adjust the marginal surplus 
in the trade balance. The terms of trade, defined by the difference in prices of exported and imported  goods, 
have negative effects, reproducing the decrease in domestic prices and costs in the Brazilian economy. Since 
the physical and the knowledge capital stocks present a lagged movement from one year to another in relation 
to current investments, the adjustment of the sectoral production occurs mainly by the labor market, whereas 
the labor factor is mobile intersectorally and its supply is relatively more elastic. Thus,  GDP decline in both 
policy simulations is associated with an aggregate employment below employment trends in the short-term, 
negatively affecting the real wage in the following period. On the other hand, according to mechanisms of a 
lagged adjustment process in the labor market, the initial employment growth negatively reaches the real wage 
in  the  subsequent  years.  The  reduction  of  the  real  wage  rates,  which  represents  a  cost  decrease  for  each

employment trend in 2025. This time path occurs both in the absence of public financing and in the TFP effects 
(Table 4). 

During  the  period  covered  by  the  policy  simulations,  the  decrease  in  economic  activity  generates 
shrinkage in the capital demand of the economic system. This creates a downward pressure on capital rentals 
due  to  the  imperfect  substitutability  among  the  primary  factors  and  by  the  explicit  relations  of  one-year 
gestation lag between the capital accumulation functions and the allocation of investments, which is guided by 
rates of return. Then, in both experiments, the reduction of capital rentals and asset prices negatively affects 
investors’  current  and  expected  return  rates,  discouraging  the  volume  invested  for  subsequent  years. 
Nevertheless, to the extent that capital depletes in the following years, the drop in the supply of physical and 
knowledge capital to a given production requirement gradually increases, which causes capital rentals and the 
expected rates of return and investment in each subsequent year to decrease as well. The volume of investments 
reacts positively to an outdated move, which would contribute to capital accumulation. Following this process, 
there is a continuous cooling of the negative changes in investments and capital until 2025. The inflection of 
the declining trajectory of investments and capital occurs shortly after the period of simulated policies.  For 
example, the trajectory of the knowledge stock is inflected in 2018, one year after the very inflection of R&D 
investment. Given the theoretical specification of capital and investments,  a slight  resumption of economic 
activity occurs mainly through the hiring of additional labor in 2017. In the long-term, cutting public R&D 
investment  funding and the related productivity loss  lead to knowledge stock deviations  below the baseline 
forecast path (around -3.79%).  

However, the negative effects indirectly influence physical investment itself, because the reduction of 
production requirements in the R&D-producing sectors cause physical capital rental to decrease, lowering the 
volume  of  physical  investments  in  the  years  when  the  policy  is  implemented.  In  general,  capital-intensive 
activities  face  larger  declines  in  their  output  and  expected  rate  of  return  (Table  4  and  Figure  5,  Panel  b). 
Medium-high and high technology-intensive industries are the ones that would most shrink in the long run 
without public funding and with the loss of productive efficiency (Table 5). By definition, they are sectors that 
are intensive in physical and knowledge capital, that absorb the largest shares of public  funding and are the 
most important in the country’s technological base. Together, these two types of industries accounted for 15% 
of total R&D investment and 34% of private R&D in the country during the period analyzed (see Table 2). 
Knowledge capital stock contracts by more than 20% in relation to the baseline until 2025. Given the capital-
accumulation  method,  this  cumulative  fall  of  the  knowledge  capital  is  traced  by  the  declining  time  path  of 
private R&D investments (Table 5). 

In addition,  Figure 7 reports the main sectoral activities which are intensive in R&D and suggests that 
sectors such as Automobiles, trucks and buses, Machinery and mechanical equipment, Parts and accessories 
for vehicles, Other transportation equipment and Chemicals in general are those with medium-high and high 
technological intensity that present the highest losses in knowledge capital stock. The internal and external 
sales of these economic activities would accompany this negative trend. In general, R&D-intensive industries 
and KIBS, both dependent on public financing, are those with the largest declines in output, investment, and 
capital stock, including physical capital. The greater part of these negative effects is caused by TFP loss. The 
agricultural sector benefited from the deflationary effect of costs caused by the public financing cut policy, but 
only in the short term. Thus, disregarding the adverse TFP effect, the absence of public financing, by penalizing 
industrial and service activities, could promote some movement of economic primarization and specialization 
in the short term. By 2025, the downturn in domestic and external markets negatively affects all activity sectors 
in the country, even those that are labor-intensive (Figure 6, Panel a).

Due to declining in demand and the increase in unit production costs, R&D production in the Brazilian 
economy decreases by about 6.3% in 2025, despite the growth of public R&D in the period. Consequently, the 
R&D intensity rate (% GDP) in the Brazilian economy reduces by almost 0.11 p.p. in relation to the baseline

forecast  path,  from  0.68%  to  0.57%. The  industry  loses  its  share in the  sectoral composition  of  knowledge 
capital  and  R&D  investment,  with  a  drop  of  5  p.p.  and  6  p.p.,  respectively.  Investments  and  public  R&D 
production increase due to the lowering of the primary factors in private production costs, allowing additional 
units of knowledge capital creation – a cumulative deviation of around 4.87% in 2025 (Table 5 and Figure 6, 
Panel b). Therefore, policy simulations suggest that the lack of public financing in private R&D investment 
makes the public sector even more responsible for producing the country’s technological base in a scenario of 
declining R&D intensity. Public education is one of the main sources of expansion of knowledge stock (with 
an accumulated deviation of 4.7%), although the Brazilian economy is less intensive in R&D (Figure 7). These 
results corroborate the assertions of Pellens et al.  (2018), who point out which economic downturns would 
systematically modify the composition of public R&D spending, leading  to a countercyclical strategy of the 
private sectors with the highest technological intensity. 

5  Concluding Remarks  

This paper offers contributions on the role of public financing in private R&D investments, evaluating 
what would be the main economic effects if this form of public policy were inexistent in the Brazilian economy. 
Given that the benchmark scenario of the Brazilian economy had already been observed,  we sought to fully 
withdraw the R&D funding amounts and to assess deviations from the main macroeconomic indicators and the 
main sectoral groups. R&D investments promote productivity gains of the primary factors. In this sense, the 
absence  of  public  financing  policies  also  implies  TFP  loss  in  the  productive  system.  Thus,  the  research 
proceeded from the development of an empirical strategy of integration of a two-stage econometric model, 
which estimated the TFP elasticity in relation to R&D investments, alongside a dynamic general equilibrium 
model  that  incorporate  applied  elements  within  its  theoretical  structure,  such  as  different  forms  of  sectoral 
allocation of investments and the flow-stock relationship between knowledge capital and R&D investment. 
This CGE model allowed us to consider direct and indirect channels for the production and consumption links 
established  with  knowledge  capital,  R&D  investment  and  changes  in  TFP,  whose  elements  treat  the 
performance of the economy better than standard CGE models 

The main findings show that the cutback in public financing policies and the loss of productive efficiency 
would cause the country to be less R&D intensive, and the public sector to be even more responsible for and 
pressured into producing the country’s knowledge stock. The role of public education in this regard would be 
even  greater  in  promoting  R&D  in  Brazil  in  the  face  of  a  possible  cut  of  funding  in  the  public  budget.  In 
addition, the cutback in public investment to private R&D spending would also generate indirect and adverse 
effects on the formation of physical capital, in view of the loss of return on capital and investments between 
2011 and 2025. There would be, in general, a decrease in the GDP (for domestic and external markets) and in 
the level of activity of the industrial sectors of high and medium-high technological intensity, the very ones 
which depend on public R&D the most. This scenario of reduction of the country’s technological base would 
counteract the tendency of the main economies in the world, which seek to increase their R&D intensity in a 
context of rapid internationalization and fragmentation of production processes around the world.
