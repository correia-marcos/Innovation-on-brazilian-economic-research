Abstract

This paper analyzes whether rural households uses labor allocation to mitigate the eﬀect
of drought shocks in the Northeaster Brazilian context. We ﬁrst document that water
scarcity leads to lower income derived from farm work as main, and higher income from
secondary jobs. We then examine the extent to which extreme droughts aﬀect time labor
allocation. Our results indicate that an additional drought shock per year is associated
with greater likelihood of have more than one job, lower share of farm activities in the
total hours worked, and higher share of secondary job. The eﬀects are higher for poorer
municipalities. These ﬁndings are consistent with a mitigation response to reduced agri-
cultural proﬁtability due to water scarcity.

Introduction

A consolidated body of research suggests that the incidence of extreme weather events, such
as droughts and ﬂoods, will rise in the coming century as a result of increased global average
temperature (Coates et al., 2014; IPCC, 2013). The economic costs of these climate-related
extreme events may be substantial and far-reaching. Much of the discussion in literature has
focused on the direct impacts of extreme weather events on health, agriculture, and income.1
However, increasing attention is being paid to the mechanisms underlying these relationships.
One intriguing question is whether families adopt income mitigation strategies in response to
extreme weather events. While previous studies provide strong evidence that droughts and
ﬂoods can have an immediate eﬀect on rural income, the extent to which families adjust labor
supply to mitigate these eﬀects has been very little investigated.2 Documenting the quantitative
importance of these labor supply and other behavioral household responses is crucial for guiding
the targeting of policies intended to mitigate the adverse consequences of climate change.

Extreme weather events can have in particular important eﬀects on time allocation of la-
bor. In context where irrigation and genetically improved seed are unavailable, rainfall shocks
are likely to negatively aﬀect agricultural productivity, most notably causing lower yields of
subsistence crops and reduce income from cash crops. As a result, engaging in agricultural
activities become less attractive and household should rise the supply of non-agricultural work
to hedge against declining agricultural proﬁtability and smoothing consumption. Therefore,
oﬀ-farm income plays a signiﬁcant role in rural households by reducing income volatility.

Understanding the labor supply responses to weather shocks is particularly relevant in de-
veloping countries. Since these countries are located in areas that are warmer, they are expected
to experience a disproportionate share of extreme weather events in the future due to climate
change. Moreover, these countries have limited social safety nets and weak institutions, so
households do not have access to the portfolio of adaptation strategies or avoidance behaviors
often available in more developed countries.

In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the relationship between rainfall shocks
and household’s labor allocation in the Northeast Brazilian context. We believe that focus
on Northeastern Brazil provides a compelling setting to investigate this question. First, it
is the driest Brazilian region and it has long been subject to harsh climatic conditions, with
recurrent events of drought and rising temperatures, leading to further enhance evaporation and
reduce water availability (Ab’S´aber, 1999; Marengo, 2009). Second, one of the most populated
semi-arid area of the world is localized in Brazilian Northeast, where more than 10 million
inhabitants are located in rural areas. For a huge fraction of this population collecting water
for consumption, hygiene, and agricultural production is a daily task that demands energy
and resources. Lack of adequate access to water also increases the susceptibility to climatic
shocks associated with ﬂuctuations in rainfall (Ab’S´aber, 1999; Cirilo, 2008; Insa/MCTI, 2014;
Rocha and Soares, 2015). Furthermore, half of all Brazilian rural dwellers and family farming
establishments are in Northeast. Almost all of the total area sown in the region is rainfed.
Only 2 percent of net area is irrigated.3 Therefore, we would expect rainfall to be an important
driver of agricultural productivity and household income.

We make use of high frequency gridded information on precipitation and temperature to

construct a municipality-by-year weather dataset which then is combined with household mi-
crodata by using place and survey month. Our identiﬁcation strategy exploits variation in
rainfall records over time within municipalities, and relies on the assumption that weather
shocks, conditional on municipality and year ﬁxed-eﬀects, are not correlated with other latent
determinants of labor supply. This identifying assumption is plausible insofar as households
are unlikely to anticipate precisely a rainfall shock at a given moment in time and place.

We begin our analysis by providing evidence that negative rainfall shocks aﬀect household
income in our setting. Although income registries are likely to be subject to considerable
measurement error in household surveys, we still observe that drought shocks are signiﬁcantly
associated with lower income derived from the main job. This is especially true when we
consider income derived from agricultural activities. Moreover, higher incidence of drought
shocks are signiﬁcantly associated with increased income from secondary jobs. These results
give us conﬁdence that rainfall shocks are in fact an income shifter in our setting.

We then explore the extent to which drought shocks aﬀect labor time allocation. We ﬁnd
that negative rainfall shocks are associated with greater likelihood of being employed in more
than one job, lower share of farm activities, and higher share of secondary job. We also assess
whether these eﬀects vary heterogeneously according with municipality’s level of development.
The results indicate stronger eﬀects among families residing municipalities with lower per capita
income. Taken in their entirety, these results are consistent with a mitigation response to
reduced agricultural proﬁts due to water scarcity.

A potential identiﬁcation issue pervading our analysis is migration. What if families migrate
away from areas aﬀected by extreme droughts? Empirically this would be problematic only if
families that migrate in response to a negative rainfall shock are diﬀerent from those who do
not. To explore this issue, we estimate the main regressions considering only families that live
for at least ﬁve years in the current municipality. The results are broadly similar compared
to our benchmark speciﬁcation.
In addition, when we explore whether rainfall shocks are
associated with predetermined individual or household characteristics, we ﬁnd no evidence that
this happen. Thus, selective migration is unlikely to be a major problem. This is consistent
with recent work in rural Pakistan that ﬁnds no eﬀect of rainfall on the mobility of men or
women (Mueller et al., 2014).

A small number of papers, focused mostly on reallocation of main job, have examined the
relationship between weather and labor allocation. As part of a larger analysis, Jessoe et al.
(2017) evaluate the eﬀects of annual ﬂuctuations in weather on employment in rural Mexico.
They ﬁnd no eﬀect of rainfall or temperature shocks on agricultural sector, but show that
non-agricultural labor decreases with increases in extreme temperature. Rose (2001) looks at
rural Indian farm households to test labor supply responses to rainfall shock. She ﬁnds that
the probability of participating in the labor market is signiﬁcantly greater when unexpectedly
low levels of precipitation are faced. To our knowledge, there has been no study of drought
shocks on labor allocation as mitigation strategy in Brazil. In this paper, we use more detailed
information of the individual’s work. We know the number of works the person is employed,
whether the individual is employed in agricultural sector or not for each job, and the hours
worked in both main and secondary job. The fact we know the hours worked supply and not
just whether the person participates or not in the labor market, allow us to look at farm and
non-farm work as complementary rather than as substitutes only.

We start in the next section with our motivating model of the joint rural household decision
regarding farm and oﬀ-farm labor supply. Section 3 describes our data and empirical strategy.
Section 4 presents our ﬁndings and robustness checks. Section 5 concludes.

2 A model of rural household labor

We developed a simple model of the joint rural household decision regarding farm and oﬀ-farm
labor supply. The household decides to allocate the time T among three activities:
leisure
(lz), farm labor (lf arm) and oﬀ-farm labor (lof f ), such that T = lz + lf arm + lof f . Let c be
consumption. The rural household utility function U (c, lz) is concave and twice diﬀerentiable.
The total utility function of the rural household is:

U (c, lz) = u(c) + αlz

(1)

Let w denote the oﬀ-farm wage and, since the agricultural household is a price-taker in all
markets (Singh, Squire and Strauss, 1986), we assume that w is determined exogenously. So,
household will be paid wlof f for time spent working in oﬀ-farm labor. Let π be the revenue from
agriculture, which is given by agricultural production. Agricultural production is determined by
the amount of farm labor, weather shocks, and ﬁxed capital and land. It may be represented
by the production function q(lf arm, R, K), where lf arm is the quantity of labor allocated to
farm activities, R the weather shock, and K is capital and land.4 R is a random variable
that aﬀects farm proﬁts, a higher value of R indicates better weather. It could be deﬁned as
the deviation between the total rainfall in given moment of time and the historical average
rainfall.5 Literature shows that rural Northeastern Brazil turns positive rainfall shocks into
unequivocally beneﬁcial events, enabling us to assume that ∂q
∂R > 0.6 Total rural household
income is given by the sum of farm revenue and oﬀ-farm income, and it may be represented by
I = P q(lf arm, R, K) + wlof f . Thus, consumption will be

c = I

(2)

(3)
The time allocated to leisure is expressed by lz = T − lf arm − lof f . Thus, we can substitute

c = P q(lf arm, R, K) + wlof f

this into the maximization problem to get

U(cid:2)P q(lf arm, R, K) + wlof f , T − lf arm − lof f(cid:3)

lf arm,lof f

We consider the case where rural households allocate time for both farm and oﬀ-farm ac-

tivities. In this case, the ﬁrst order conditions of the optimization problem (4) are given by

where u(cid:48)(c) is the marginal utility of the consume and α is the marginal utility of leisure.

We are interested in the eﬀect that weather shocks have on the optimal level of both farm
and oﬀ-farm labor. That is, how would we expect an adverse weather shock to aﬀect the rural
household labor decision? They would use oﬀ-farm labor as a mitigation strategy to weather
shocks? These questions lead us to our two testable hypothesis:

Proposition 1. Negative rainfall shocks decrease household farm labor supply.

Proof. It follows from the ﬁrst order condition:

(cid:4)

Farm work has a positive relationship with R. In other words, an increase (reduction) in R
implies in increasing (decreasing) farm labor. In this model, there is only one way that weather
shocks aﬀect the choice of farm work. When a drought is faced, the marginal productivity of
agricultural labor will reduce, which implies a diminishing in the return of farm labor. Thereby,
agricultural activities become less attractive. Household will allocate less time to farm labor,
thus reducing lf arm. However, positive rainfall shocks increase the beneﬁt to farm working,
agricultural wage rises and household will increase farm labor supply.

Proposition 2. Negative rainfall shocks increase household non-agricultural labor supply.

Proof. From the ﬁrst order condition, we can derivate the eﬀect of weather shocks on the
optimal choice of oﬀ-farm working:

Weather shock has two eﬀects on the optimal level of oﬀ-farm labor. First, a drought
decreases both farmland productivity and the value of agricultural work, which aﬀect the beneﬁt
of time spent in farm labor. Thus, oﬀ-farm labor becomes more attractive, and household will
increase lof f . Second, droughts decreases the value of marginal productivity of farm labor.
Since the marginal return associated to oﬀ-farm activities is higher, the household could choose
oﬀ-farm labor above the optimal level, leading to rising the total income, and mitigating the
shocks eﬀect.

3 Data and Empirical Strategy

3.1 Household data

Our basic source for labor market outcomes in the rural Northeast is from the Brazilian House-
hold Survey (PNAD). Every year since 1967, the Brazilian Bureau of Statistics (IBGE) has
implemented the PNAD throughout Brazil during the month of September.7 It is nationally
and regionally representative, and contains detailed information on socio-economic and demo-
graphic characteristics. Since its implementation, PNAD passed through many methodological
alterations along the years. Thus, we restrict our analysis to the period between 2001 and 2014,
for which questionnaires and consistent sampling methodologies were maintained.

Importantly for our study, the PNAD asks whether respondents work with agriculture, are
self-employed, wage-employee, employers, or whether they grow for their own consumption. In
addition, respondents are asked to provide information about the number of jobs they have,
and the amount of hours usually spent in each job per week. This allows us to calculate the
participation of each job in the total of hours worked. The rural sample is comprised of 145,425
individuals from 40,519 households in 150 municipalities. Employment data are available for
92,006 individuals, among which 47,295 are the head of household.8

We restrict the sample to those living outside of urban areas because our causal factor
of interest, rainfall, should mainly have an eﬀect in rural areas. We also restrict the sample
to individuals aged 10 to 70. The householder’s characteristics, just as gender, age, years of
schooling, and family size, are also collected from the PNAD. Our main outcomes of interest
include probability of have more than one job, ratio of farm work in the total worked, share of
secondary job in the total of hours worked, and likelihood of at least one family member being
employed in nonagricultural work (oﬀ-farm likelihood). Table 1 presents summary statistics of
these variables. In rural Northeastern, more than 70% of individuals report agriculture as their
principal economic activity. Most of them are self-employed, while 25% help another member
of the household and do not receive any salary. On average, only seven percent of individuals
are employed in more than one job, and the share of time spent on these secondary occupations
of the total hours worked is 2,82%.

3.2 Climate data

Weather data are based on a reanalysis model, ERA-Interim. The ERA-Interim database
provides daily temperature and precipitation information with horizontal resolution of 12 Km
and covers the period from 1 January 1979 onwards. We use a geo-spatial software to aggregate
the data to the municipality level and calculate an average of the points located inside the

7Except in the Brazilian Censuses years, that is conducted of each ten years.
8The basic idea underlying our empirical approach is to compare householders who experienced diﬀerent
climatic conditions in a given moment in time. Using diﬀerent rounds of the PNAD, we can compare fami-
lies (individuals) in diﬀerent moments in time and place, so that there is a great amount of variation across
municipalities and years in weather conditions and our dependent variables. PNAD is not longitudinal, so we
are unable to observe the same individuals in diﬀerent years. However, this does not jeopardize our empirical
approach. As we discuss below in more detail, our identifying assumption is that, conditional on municipality
and year ﬁxed eﬀects, weather shocks are orthogonal to other determinants of the variables of interest. This
plausible assumption is suﬃcient to estimate the impact of weather shocks on our labor outcomes. Thereby, the
relevant source of variation in our study is at the municipality-level.

municipality limits.9 We make use of this daily data in order to construct drought shock
measures.

To analyze the eﬀect of weather on rural labor allocation, we construct several measures
of drought shocks. Our ﬁrst measure is the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI).10 The
SPI calculation is based on the long-term precipitation record for a desired period. This long
term-record is ﬁtted to a probability distribution, which is then transformed into a normal
distribution (Mckee et al., 1993). Its probabilistic nature gives it historical context, and since
it is spatially consistent, it allows for comparisons between diﬀerent locations, both are well
suited for decision-making. Negatives SPI values indicate less than median precipitation and
characterizes a drought. The drought intensity depends which value SPI reaches. Whether
it reaches until -0.99 is within the “mild dryness” category, from -1 to -1.49 is “moderate
dryness”, if it is between -1.50 and -1.99 “severe dryness” and from -2 onwards is “extreme
dryness” category. Any value above zero is not considered an negative rainfall event. Figure 1
presents the yearly averages for SPI.

To calculate the SPI index, we ﬁrst aggregate weather data to the municipality-by-month-
by-year level. These collapsed data contain total precipitation and average temperature for
each municipality in a given month and year. We then deﬁne drought as equal to 1 if SPI is
below -1 and 0 otherwise for a given month in each municipality. This deﬁnition is similar to
the one employed by Kaur (2013), Rocha and Soares (2015) and Shah and Steinberg (2017).
Having deﬁned a drought month, our ﬁnal measure of exposure to droughts is computed as the
number of months that each municipality faced a drought shock over the 12 months prior to
PNAD survey month. Figure 2 reports the time series for the drought variable, indicating the
percentage of municipalities with SPI below -1. One can see that there are periods with no
municipality facing a drought, and others with drought heating 90 percent of the municipalities.
This shows how the intensity of negative shocks varies geographically within a given month.

Our second measure of drought shock is the longest consecutive dry days (CDD). Consecu-
tive dry days is the greatest number of consecutive days for the period over the twelve months
prior the survey, with daily precipitation amount below 1 mm. Figure 3 portrays the CDD in
1979 and 2016, respectively, for entire Northeastern Brazil. It shows that drought shocks at
a point in time are not homogenous throughout the Northeastern region. Some areas may be
suﬀering harsh rainfall conditions, spending more than three hundred days without rain, while
others may not be.

3.3 Empirical strategy

To identify the impacts of weather shocks on rural household labor allocation, we estimate the
following model:

Hijt = α + β1Djt + β2Xijt + ωTjt + θj + ϕt + ξijt

(11)

where Hijt is the labor outcome of interest for individual i, in municipality j and year t.
The labor outcomes in this study are the number of jobs, ratio of farm work in the total worked
and share of secondary job in the total of hours worked. We also consider these outcomes at
the family level, since literature suggests that time allocation is a household decision-making

9Considering the small grid used, almost all municipalities (1,485 out of 1,794) have had points inside their
limits. For those that have had not, we use the four closest points on the grid to the center of the municipality,
using the linear distances from the municipality’s centroid to each node as weights.

10See Mckee et al. (1993) for more details.

process rather than an individual one.11 In particular, we consider a dummy indicating whether
at least one household member is mainly employed in the oﬀ-farm market. Djt is a drought
shock measure (either the longest consecutive dry days in the 12 months prior to survey or
the number of drought months in the same period) in year t and municipality j, which is our
regressor of interest. We also control for householder’s characteristics, just as gender, age, race
and family size, by including the vector Xijt. Tjt is the average temperature in the municipality
j, on year t.12

The model includes municipality ﬁxed eﬀects (θj), which absorb any unobservable time
invariant factors, including initial conditions and persistent municipality characteristics such
as geography. Year ﬁxed eﬀects (ϕt) capture aggregate shocks impacting all Northeast region,
including aggregated demand shocks, and regional policies and programs. Standard errors
are clustered at the municipality level to account for serial correlation (Bertrand et al., 2004;
Wooldridge, 2003).13

The parameter of interest β1 measures the relationship between rainfall shocks and labor
market outcomes. The identifying assumption underlying this statistical approach is that, con-
ditional on municipality and year ﬁxed eﬀects, there are not determinants omitted of labor mar-
ket outcomes correlated with the incidence of weather shocks. This seems plausible, given that
the occurrence of extreme weather event at a given moment in time and place is unpredictable.
Thus, our approach exploits arguably random ﬂuctuations in rainfall from municipality-speciﬁc
deviations in long-term rainfall after controlling for all seasonal factors and common shocks to
all municipalities.

Although much of the variation in rainfall shocks over time within municipalities appears
to be idiosyncratic, an identiﬁcation issue could arise when following this speciﬁcation.
In
particular, one may be concerned whether rural families respond migrating away from areas
aﬀected by extreme droughts. This would be problematic only if families that migrate in
response to an extreme rainfall shock are diﬀerent to families who do not. We address this
issue in two way. First, we estimate the main regressions considering only families that live for
at least ﬁve years in the current municipality. If regression results are similar to the ones derived
from the baseline, we would be more conﬁdent that selective migration is unlikely to be a major
issue. Second, we explore whether rainfall shocks are associated with predetermined individual
or household characteristics. If diﬀerent families are more likely to respond to rainfall shocks
by migrating, one would expect to see signiﬁcant eﬀects of rainfall shocks on predetermined
characteristics. As we shown below, there is very little evidence that this is the case. Perhaps,
this is not very surprisingly, given we are exploiting temporary deviations in rainfall from the
historical norm. Migration is likely to be a more salient issue in the case of prolonged and
permanent changes in rainfall.

11See, for example,D´emurger et al. (2010), Ellis (2000), Janvry and Sadoulet (2001), Jonasson and Helfand

(2010), Mishra and Goodwin (1997), and Vergara et al. (2004).

12We also control for bins of temperature in order to capture its nonlinear impacts. The results were the

same, with temperature presenting no statistical signiﬁcance.

13We also compute standard errors clustered at micro and macro-region level. Statistical signiﬁcance is the

same.

4 Results

4.1 Eﬀects of Drought Shocks on Rural Labor Allocation

We begin by examining the eﬀects of drought shocks on income. Table 2 presents the results
from estimating equation (11) for the primary and secondary income. All regressions results
are based on a speciﬁcation that adjust for municipality ﬁxed eﬀects, year ﬁxed eﬀects, a set
of demographic characteristics of the household head. Sample sizes and R-squared’s of the
regressions are shown at the bottom of the table.

Column (1) explores the eﬀects of extreme negative rainfall shocks on income derived from
the main job. The results indicate that negative rainfall shocks are signiﬁcantly associated
with lower income derived from the main job, especially for those engaged with farm activities
(column 2). This is what one would expect given that a considerable fraction of population in
this region depends on farming and related agricultural activities for living. The fact that we
observe signiﬁcant reductions in income associated to extreme droughts is reassuring given that
data on income are generally measured with substantial error in household surveys.

Column (3) investigates the eﬀects on income derived from secondary jobs. The point
estimate of the coeﬃcient of interest is 0.0251 (standard error =0.0119), which statistically
diﬀerent from zero at the 5 percent level of signiﬁcance. This estimate suggests that drought
shocks are associated with higher income from secondary jobs. An increase of one drought per
year implies an increase of 5.45 percent in the dependent variable. We interpret this result as
preliminary evidence that rural families respond to negative rainfall shocks by increasing the
supply of secondary jobs. In particular, this evidence is consistent with a mitigation response
to reduced income from cash crops due to water scarcity.

Having established that drought shocks aﬀect rural household income, we turn to the anal-
ysis of labor supply responses. We present estimates of equation (11) for a series of labor
outcomes in Table 3.14 Panel A presents the results from using drought shocks based on Stan-
dardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as our key independent variable. Instead, Panel B considers
the longest consecutive dry days (CDD) as the rainfall shock measure. The ﬁrst three columns
show results for outcomes measures for the head of household, while the last three consider labor
allocation outcomes measures at household level, which assume that labor allocation is a col-
lective decision rather than an individual one. We present results with sampling weights, which
ensure that our ﬁnal follow-up database is representative of the entire initial study population,
although the results are very similar when ignoring sampling weights.

Panel A, column (1) shows that there is a positive and statistically signiﬁcant relationship
between drought and the number of jobs. One more drought shock per year increases by 5.63
percent the likelihood of being employed in more than one work. Column (2) looks at the
share of farm job as main source of income in the total hours worked. The results suggest that
there is a statistically signiﬁcant negative eﬀect of drought on the supply of farm work. The
coeﬃcient on ratio of agricultural activities in the total work is -0.567. Relative to the mean of
69, this suggests an small decrease of 0.82 percent. But note that the estimate in column (3)
implies an eﬀect that is an increase of 6.6 percent in the share of hours worked in secondary
job, relative to mean of 4.7. These results may indicate that they oﬀer more hours to oﬀ-farm
activities not trough a large decrease of farm labor supply but increasing the total amount of

worked hours. This way they can compensate the loss of farm income, and mitigate the shock.
Columns (4) to (6) explore the eﬀects of drought shocks on the outcomes measures at the
family level. In columns (4) and (5), the results are qualitatively similar to the ones observed
at the head of household level. In column (6) we ﬁnd a statistically insigniﬁcant relationship
between drought shocks and the likelihood of at least one family member chooses oﬀ-farm
as main occupation. In addition, the estimated coeﬃcient are very small in magnitude. For
instance, the estimated coeﬃcient of interest is -0.0004, which means that, one more drought
month implies an eﬀect that is 0,10% of the average and 0,0005% of the standard deviation in our
dependent variable. In Panel B, we present analogous results using CDD as the independent
variable. The qualitative patterns are similar - indicating in this case that droughts shocks
are associated with rural households labor allocation, although the quantitative patterns are
smaller. In light of the results from Table 3, we concentrate from now on on the sum of drought
months based on SPI as our preferred independent variable.

To assess potential heterogeneities of the eﬀects of negative rainfall shocks we stratify the
sample according to level of municipality GDP per capita. Exploring GDP is of special interest
since it is a reasonable proxy for local development. It seems to reasonable to expect smaller
impacts of extreme droughts on income and thus on time labor allocation in more developed
areas where there are often higher access to credit markets, more formal social safety net
programs, and where the capacity of adaptation is higher. Figure 4 portrays the coeﬃcients,
90 and 95 percent conﬁdence intervals from estimating equation (11) for both municipalities
with low and high GDP per capita separately. If the municipality is characterized by GDP per
capita at the 50th percentile of the Northeast GDP distribution it is considered a low GDP
municipality, otherwise it is a high GDP one.

In Panel A, we regress labor outcomes of the head of household on drought shocks. One
can see how the eﬀect of negative rainfall shocks changes with income per capita. Lower
income seems to be associated with higher impacts of rainfall variation. When we compare the
likelihood of being employed in more than one work, one can observe a positive signiﬁcant eﬀect
of drought shocks in municipalities with low GDP per capita and a statistically insigniﬁcant
eﬀect in those with high GDP. Individuals faced a drought shock in the previous year are 0.67
percentage point more likely to report having more than one job in the survey month, this is an
increase of 5.58 percent from a mean of 0.12. While one more drought shock is not statistically
signiﬁcant to impact the share of farm work in high GDP municipalities, for those whom live
with low income the point estimate of the coeﬃcient of interest is -0.74 (standard error =0.29),
which statistically diﬀerent from zero at the 5 percent level of signiﬁcance. The eﬀect is larger
in the share of secondary employment, increasing 7.5 per cent relative to a mean of 4.82. Panel
B plots our baseline model for dependent variables at the family level. The qualitative and
quantitative patterns are similar to ones ﬁnd in Panel A. The results show that individuals with
lower income are more vulnerable to weather shocks, and conﬁrm the importance of adjustments
in labor allocation to protect income due to decreasing in agricultural productivity.

The Northeastern presents vast variation in precipitation within year and between munici-
palities. One might expect there to be signiﬁcant heterogeneity according to prevailing rainfall
patterns. So we asses if drought shocks will have the same impacts on labor outcomes where
rainfall levels are bellow 50th percentile of historical average (low rainfall patterns) as they
would in areas that are above the median (high rainfall patterns). In Table 4, we regress labor
outcomes on weather shock, as well as their interaction with a dummy indicating whether the
municipality is low or high rainfall pattern. The interaction term indicates whether the eﬀect of
the drought shock depends on more general climate conditions. This is similar to the strategy

9

employed in Blakeslee and Fishman (2017). The drought variable shows similar coeﬃcients to
those found before, and the drought shock interaction term are small and not signiﬁcant. Thus,
there is no evidence that the eﬀect of negative rainfall shocks is mitigated by higher median
rainfall levels.

4.2 Further Results and Robustness Checks

We assess the robustness of our estimates to alternative speciﬁcations and sample selection
criteria. As mentioned before, we expect that much of the variation in rainfall shocks over
time within municipalities is idiosyncratic, but an identiﬁcation issue could arise whether rural
families respond to rainfall shocks by migrating away from areas aﬀected by extreme droughts.
We assess on this issue in two way. First, in Appendix Table A1 we replicate the baseline
speciﬁcation using only the rural households that live for at least ﬁve years in the current
municipality. As can be seen from the table, the results are very similar to the baseline. We
obtain the same order of magnitude for all estimated coeﬃcients, as well as for standard errors.
The only exception is share of hours spent in agricultural main job in the total, where the
estimated coeﬃcients of interest are not signiﬁcant. However, this result may be due to low
statistical power given the reduced sample size. Point estimates are in fact very similar to the
baselines and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that both estimates are the same.

Second, as discussed above, if diﬀerent families are more likely to respond to rainfall shocks
by migrating, one would expect to see signiﬁcant eﬀects of rainfall shocks on predetermined
characteristics. To explore this issue, Table A2 estimates whether rainfall shocks are associated
with any individual or household characteristics for all economically active population in our
sample. All regressions results are based on a speciﬁcation that adjust for municipality ﬁxed
eﬀects, year ﬁxed eﬀects and are clustered at the municipality level. Columns (1) to (3) assess
estimates of the eﬀect of rainfall negative shocks on the head of household characteristics such as
age, gender and education. Column (4) shows estimates for family size as dependent variable.
Out of four estimated coeﬃcients of interest, none is statistically signiﬁcant. Thus, there is
little evidence that our baseline results are in fact driven by migration.

Rainfall variation across space and time should generate corresponding variation in agricul-
tural output and thus should mainly have a bigger eﬀect in rural areas rather than urban. To
assess if this occur in Northeastern Brazil, we examine the eﬀect of drought shocks on labor
outcomes of urban households. Table A3 presents the estimates for this subsample. As can
be seen from the table, there is no signiﬁcant eﬀect of negative rainfall shocks on urban labor
outcomes; most eﬀects are concentrated in rural areas.

5 Conclusion

It is already well documented in the literature the acute vulnerability of developing countries
to extreme weather events. Water scarcity is a major problem for a large fraction of the rural
population in these countries. Climate change is likely to make it an even more recurrent phe-
nomenon in the coming decades. Considering the economic situation of most rural households
in developing countries, adaptation will play a limited role in mitigating the impacts of climate
change on agricultural production. Thus, this paper investigates the eﬀects of drought shocks
on rural household non-agricultural labor supply.

Reducing the variability of agricultural income streams is of paramount importance to im-
prove welfare of rural dwellers. Given the constraints faced in the insurance and credit markets

10

by most rural families in developing countries, labor reallocation can be one of the main chan-
nels by which poor rural households mitigate negative rainfall shocks. Engaging in oﬀ-farm
labor market might help households to smooth income.

The strategy outlined here presents evidence of a relationship between negative rainfall
events and labor time reallocation. We ﬁnd that drought shocks are signiﬁcantly associated
with lower income derived from the main job. This is especially true when we consider income
derived from farm activities. Moreover, higher incidence of drought shocks are signiﬁcantly
associated with increased income from secondary jobs. Our results show that droughts aﬀect
negatively hours spent on farm work, whereas lead to increased supply of non-agricultural
job. One can also observe stronger eﬀects among families residing in municipalities with lower
per capita income. Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that families adjust labor supply to
mitigate the income eﬀects of water scarcity.
