Abstract

This paper investigates how the disclosure of new information regarding the
recent behavior of in(cid:135)ation a⁄ects in(cid:135)ation expectations. Using a panel of more
than 100 professional forecasters and the release of a signal about the in(cid:135)ation rate
to identify the e⁄ects, we (cid:133)nd that new information leads individual forecasters to
update their expectations immediately, supporting Carrol(cid:146)s (2003) results. However,
the parameter is not very high, which is consistent with sticky information and
staggered updating of expectations. The precision of new information also matters:
when precision increases agents put more weight on the piece of information received.
These results, which are found to be robust, are consistent with Morris and Shin(cid:146)s
(2002) model. Estimates also suggest that the magnitude of the updating depends
on the distance between the sinal that agents receive and their current expectations.

1 Introduction

Expectations are a key ingredient in macro and microeconomic models, and have be-
come central to the conduct of monetary policy. In macroeconomic models, for instance,
staggered updating of expectations generates strong and persistent real e⁄ects following
nominal shocks (Mankiw and Reis, 2002; Sims, 2003; Ma·ckowiak and Wiederholt, 2009).
The e⁄ects of these frictions are similar to those of price rigidity. The introduction of
information frictions in macroeconomic models is also known to produce di⁄erent impli-
cations for policy making (Reis, 2011; Paciello and Wiederholt, 2014) and helped to solve
several empirical puzzles (see Ball et al., 2005).

There are two main approaches to rationally incorporate information frictions in
macroeconomic models.
In Mankiw and Reis (2002) agents update only infrequently
because collecting and processing information is costly. However, if agents update, they
gain full information. In Sims (2003) agents update continously but face a limited ca-
pacity of attention, which makes it impossible to process all information available. Yet,
in these two approaches there is no di⁄erence as to how di⁄erent agents process informa-
tion. In contrast, Carrol (2003) argues that professional forecasters and regular people
respond di⁄erently to new information: professional forecasters are rational and pay close
attention to all macroeconomic facts, responding immediately to news, but regular people
react only slowly, absorbing the economic content of media news from period to period in
a way similar to an epidemiology.

Despite the importance of expectations and di⁄erences in theoretical approaches, there
In
is still only sparse empirical evidence about how people form their expectations.
particular, how individual agents update their expectations when new information arises
remains an open question. For instance, does it take time for agents to react when new
information is released or is reaction instantaneous? Does the precision of new information
matter for the updating process? Is the updating a linear function of the magnitude of
the surprise or reaction increases, for example, when precision is higher?

This paper aims to estimate the e⁄ects of new information on the updating of ex-
pectations of market specialists. Our analysis makes use of a panel of more than 100
professional forecasters from a unique survey of expectations conducted by the Central
Bank of Brazil (CBB). The distinctive feature of the BCB(cid:146)s survey is that data are col-
lected every single day, allowing to identify the reaction of expectations at the moment
that speci(cid:133)c events take place.

Our study o⁄ers a direct test for the signi(cid:133)cance of the impact of new information

2

on the updating behavior by using the release of a signal about the in(cid:135)ation rate. The
paper focuses on in(cid:135)ation expectations for the current month and covers the period be-
tween January 2006 and September 2013. In Brazil, the o¢ cial IPCA in(cid:135)ation rate is
calculated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), but Getulio
Vargas Foundation (FGV) has developed and since 2006 releases a daily (cid:135)ash estimate
that mimics the IPCA, called In(cid:135)ation Monitor. Every month, the Monitor covering the
same reference period as the IPCA is released about eight days before the o(cid:133)cial IPCA.
This means that the Monitor released on this date can be viewed as a signal about the
IPCA in(cid:135)ation. We explore these events assuming as crucial identifying assumption that
the window we use around the release dates is short enough to ensure that the Monitor
release is the only information causing changes in expectations. This approach is possible
because we have daily data on in(cid:135)ations expectations.

Our paper is closely related to studies that analyze the expectations formation process
empirically. Amantier et al. (2013) use an experiment embedded in a survey to invetigate
how consumer(cid:146)s in(cid:135)ation expectations respond to new information. Coibion (2010) and
Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2012) document evidence consistent with information rigidi-
ties. Lamla and Sarferaz (2012) show that the updating of in(cid:135)ation expectations changes
substatially over time and that either the quantity and quality of the news received mat-
ter. Carvalho and Minella (2012) have also used the BCB(cid:146)s survey to assess a wide set of
aspects characterizing market forecasts in Brazil. However, to the best of our knowledge
no other paper in the literature uses speci(cid:133)c events of disclosures of information as we
do in the present paper to identify the e⁄ect on the updating behavior. Our paper also
provides a direct empirical application of the Morris and Shin(cid:146)s (2002) model.

The results of our estimations support the view that new information leads individual
professional forecasters to update their expectations immediately, supporting Carrol(cid:146)s
(2003) results. The parameter measuring the e⁄ect of new information is higly statistically
signi(cid:133)cant. When new information indicates that in(cid:135)ation for the current month may be
higher than the individual forecast, the agent increases their expectations; and he/she
decreases expectations in the opposite case. This also provides evidence that professional
forecasters consider the Monitor a valuable signal about the in(cid:135)ation dynamics in Brazil.
However, the parameter of new information is not very high (around 0.35), which is
consistent with sticky information and staggered updating of expectations. The precision
of new information is also found to matter a great deal(cid:151) the higher the precision, the
greater the size of the updating. In e⁄ect, the impact is nonlinear: when precision increases
agents put more weight on the new information received. In summary, these results, which

3

are subjected to several robusness checks and found to be robust, support the conclusions
of Morris and Shin(cid:146)s (2002) model.

We also estimate a threshold model to test more formally another nonlinear e⁄ect
suggested by the data: that individual(cid:146)s reaction depends on the distance of the sinal
that agents receive from their current expectations. Estimates of the model using the size
of the market surprise caused by the new information as the threshold variable support
these conclusions. Point estimates of the coe¢ cient of new information is almost twice as
large in the state of great surprise compared to that in the state of low surprise.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a simple signal
extraction model to motivate the empirical analysis and provides some prediction on how
new information a⁄ects the updating of expectations. Section 3 describes the datasets
used and section 4 presents the empirical results. Section 5 concludes.

2 Theoretical framework

We consider a simple signal extraction model as in Morris and Shin (2002) to motivate
the empirical analysis. Our speci(cid:133)cation is similar to that in Crowe (2010), but here the
toy model has three periods. In the (cid:133)rst two periods each forecaster tries to guess the
in(cid:135)ation rate (cid:25) with the information they have. In the third period the actual in(cid:135)ation
rate is released. In each period, agent i chooses a forecast fi to minimize the squared
error of this in(cid:135)ation forecast, given the actual in(cid:135)ation rate (cid:25):

Li(fi; (cid:25)) (cid:17) (cid:0)(fi (cid:0) (cid:25))2:

(1)

Suppose that, in the (cid:133)rst period, agents only observe their own private signal about

the in(cid:135)ation rate and that this signal is noisy:

(cid:25)i = (cid:25) + (cid:16) i;

(2)

(cid:27)2
(cid:16)

(cid:16): Denote the precision of the private
where (cid:16) i is an i.i.d. error term with variance (cid:27)2
. We can rationalize this private signal as the whole set of information
signal as (cid:11) (cid:17) 1
that agents collect and process privately to construct their projections, including their
econometric models.
In this case, the agent i(cid:146)s best forecast of in(cid:135)ation is their own
private signal:

f(cid:3)i = (cid:25)i:

4

(3)

In the second period, in addition to the private signal, we assume that agents observe

a noisy public signal about the in(cid:135)ation rate:

(cid:25)P = (cid:25) + (cid:17);

(4)

with the variance of the i.i.d. error term (cid:17) denoted as (cid:27)2
de(cid:133)ned as (cid:12) (cid:17) 1

: We also assume that:

(cid:27)2
(cid:17)

(cid:17) and the precision of this signal

(cid:16) i ? (cid:16) j ? (cid:17); for all periods and for all individuals i and j:

Now forecasters optimally weight the signals according to their relative precisions:

f(cid:3)i =

(cid:11)

(cid:11) + (cid:12)

(cid:25)i +

(cid:12)

(cid:11) + (cid:12)

(cid:25)P :

(5)

And the update of the agent i(cid:146)s in(cid:135)ation forecast from period one to period two, that is,
the change in their forecast after receiving the new piece of information is:

ui = (cid:20) (cid:11)

(cid:11) + (cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:25)i +

(cid:12)

(cid:11) + (cid:12)

(cid:25)P(cid:21) (cid:0) (cid:25)i

(6)

=

(cid:11) + (cid:12)

((cid:25)P (cid:0) (cid:25)i) :

Therefore, agents update their expectations depending on whether the public signal
brings information about the in(cid:135)ation rate that is di⁄erent or close to individual agents(cid:146)
current view. If new information brought by the public signal suggests that in(cid:135)ation rate
will be very close to agents(cid:146)current forecasts, there is no reason to change their expecta-
tions. In this case, the new informational content only rea¢ rms their expectations, and
the impact will probably be only on the cross-sectional dispersion of forecasts. But if the
public signal di⁄ers much of the informational content already embedded in their expecta-
tions, forecasters recognize that new information tells a di⁄erent story about the in(cid:135)ation
rate and change their forecasts accordingly, weighting the piece of new information by its
relative precision. In summary, the magnitude of the update depends on two variables: (i)
how far new information released is from the individual agent(cid:146)s current forecast (we name
this term as "surprise") and (ii) the relative precision of the new information received.

Equation (6) also suggests an interaction between the relative precision of new infor-
mation and the term of surprise (the informational content brought by the public signal).
Thus, the e⁄ect of new information on the size of the updating is nonlinear: the higher the

5

relative precision of new information, the higher the weight that agents put on the piece
of new information released, and, consequently, higher the size of the update of agents(cid:146)
expectations.

3 Data

We employ two datasets to test the predictions of the model. The (cid:133)rst dataset is the
survey conducted by the CBB among market experts. The CBB collects on a daily
basis market expectations of several key macroeconomic variables amongst more than 100
professional forecasters since the early years of the in(cid:135)ation targeting regime in Brazil.
Although the survey includes a number of variables, we focus on in(cid:135)ation expectations.
The survey compiles in(cid:135)ation expectations for di⁄erent horizons, from the current month
until 12 months ahead. Thus, we use daily information on individual in(cid:135)ation forecasts of
a panel of market experts covering the period between January 2006 and September 2013.
In(cid:135)ation forecasts refer to the Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA), which is
used for the o(cid:133)cial in(cid:135)ation target.

The second dataset comes from the daily estimates of in(cid:135)ation calculated by the
Brazilian Institute of Economics at Getulio Vargas Foundation (IBRE-FGV), which is an
institution devoted to the production and publication of macroeconomics statistics and
applied economics research. Since January 2006, FGV calculates a daily (cid:135)ash estimate
of the IPCA in(cid:135)ation for moving periods of 30 days ending on the date of computation.
The whole set of daily information produced by FGV is named In(cid:135)ation Monitor.1
It
should be emphasized that the o¢ cial IPCA is calculated by the IBGE, not by FGV. But
FGV developed a high frequency measurement of in(cid:135)ation that mimics the IPCA. The
In(cid:135)ation Monitor has the same basket and coverage as the IPCA, but it is released every
day.

Figure 1 below presents schematically the disclosure of the Monitor and the IPCA
information for a given month t. The IPCA measures the in(cid:135)ation rate for the period
between the (cid:133)rst day and the last day of the reference month, represented in Figure 1
respectively by dates j and j(cid:3). However, the o(cid:133)cial result is only known some days after
the end of the reference period(cid:151) IBGE releases the IPCA between the 5th and the 12th
day of the subsequent month. In our scheme below the release date of the o(cid:133)cial IPCA
is represented by j(cid:3) + m. But every day FGV releases its moving 30-days measure of

on the Consumer Price Index - Brazil (IPC-BR).

in(cid:135)ation. Note that on day j(cid:3) the Monitor covers exactly the same reference period as
the IPCA. This means that the release of the Monitor on day j(cid:3) is a good signal about
the IPCA in(cid:135)ation rate that will be announced only a few days later. Between j(cid:3) and
j(cid:3) + m the Monitor in(cid:135)ation rate for the current month has already been released but
agents do not know the o(cid:133)cial IPCA yet. Release dates are reported in Tables (4) and
(5) in the appendix.

We explore these events (the Monitor releases) that happen every month on day j(cid:3)
to identify the e⁄ects on the updating behavior, by estimating the impact of this piece
of information that agents receive about the IPCA in(cid:135)ation rate on the market experts(cid:146)
in(cid:135)ation expectations.

4 Empirical analysis

The model of section (2) predicts a nonlinear relation between new information and the
size of the update of expectations, which depends on the relative precision of new infor-
mation. Yet, precisely estimating a nonlinear relation with limited data is likely to be
di¢ cult. Thus, we (cid:133)rst use a linearized version of equation (6), and then we explore the
possibility of nonlinearities.

The linear approximation of equation (6) is:

ui;t ’ (cid:13)0 + (cid:13)1pi;t + (cid:13)2si;t;

(cid:13)1 > 0;

(cid:13)2 > 0;

(7)

where, for the individual i, ui;t is the update of expectations, pi;t measures the precision
of the public signal relative to the private information, and si;t captures the surprise, i.e.,
the di⁄erence between the piece of new information received and the private information.
Taking this relation to the data using the Monitor release on days j(cid:3) of each month
requires some identifying assumptions: (a) that individuals consider that piece of infor-
mation a valuable signal about the IPCA and react to it; and (b) that the window around

7

j(cid:3) is short enough to ensure that the only information a⁄ecting changes in expectations
is the Monitor release. So, the window cannot be too short, such that there is no time
for the BCB survey capture the changes in expectations, or too large that others events
begin to a⁄ect agents(cid:146)in(cid:135)ation expectations. Hence, we use a two-day window around j(cid:3)
in our estimations.

It must be recognized that the empirical countepart for ui;t may contain measurement
errors and/or be contaminated by idiosyncratic time-varying shocks to forecasts(cid:146)accuracy.
We assume that these components are captured by a linear error term "i;t. We also consider
that there may be individual unobserved e⁄ects, ci. Then, our empirical speci(cid:133)cation of
equation (7) is given by:

(cid:1)(cid:25)e

i;t = (cid:13)0 + (cid:13)1pi;t + (cid:13)2si;t + ci + "i;t;

i;t represents the change in the agent

4.1 Results

This section presents the empirical results. As a (cid:133)rst pass, we show a simple graphical
result that illustrates the relation between the surprise and the update of in(cid:135)ation expec-
tations. It than goes on to present the baseline regression results and to outline a number
of robustness exercises. Finally, it presents the results of nonlinear estimations.

Monitor. The changes in expectations are calculated in the two-day window around the
Monitor releases. The sample covers the whole period from January 2006 to September
2013 and includes all market specialists in our dataset. The relationship appears to be
positive. Figure 2 shows a large concentration of points near zero, indicating that when
new information is only slightly di⁄erent from the information that individuals have,
the reaction is small.2 However, there is evidence that new information brought by the
Monitor leads individuals to update their expectations, as predicted by the model.

4.1.2 Baseline results

The results of estimating equation (8) is presented in Table 1. Considering the possibility
of unobserved individual e⁄ects, we carried out estimations using OLS and Fixed E⁄ect
methods. We estimate two speci(cid:133)cations by the two methods. Columns I and III present
estimates of a speci(cid:133)cation in which the relative precision term is supressed, including
only the new information term si;t, using OLS and Fixed E⁄ect, respectively. Columns II
and IV show estimates of the full equation.

2It is important to mention that points on the zero axis are not caused by individuals that did not
report their new expectations after the Monitor release. Here we consider only those who have updated.
But some decided not changing their expectations.

The results in Table 1 provide strong evidence supporting the predictions of the theo-
retical model. First, the estimates of the coe¢ cient of si;t either by OLS or Fixed E⁄ect
are highly statistically signi(cid:133)cant. This means that new information brought by the dis-
closure of the Monitor a⁄ects the process of expectation formation. When the number
reported by the Monitor for the current month in(cid:135)ation is higher than market experts(cid:146)
forecasts, they update their perceptions, increasing their expectations. The opposite hap-
pens when the signal suggests that expectations might be too high: agents update their
forecasts down. This updating process is also very rapid, since our estimations capture
changes in expectations in a two-day window around the Monitor release. These (cid:133)nd-
ings support Carrol(cid:146)s (2003) results that professional forecasters pay close attention to all
macroeconomic facts and respond immediately to new information. However, the esti-
mated coe¢ cient of si;t is around 0.35, which is far from 1. This result is consistent with
sticky information and staggered updating of expectations. Second, there is evidence that
the relative precision of the signal matters. The coe¢ cient of pi;t is positive and highly
statistically signi(cid:133)cant. The higher the precision of the signal, the greater the size of the
update of expectations.

4.1.3 Robustness checks

A number of robustness checks were carried out to con(cid:133)rm the results of the previous
subsection. First, the baseline estimations using the full equation were replicated for the
Top 5 forecasters. In the BCB survey, professional forecasters are ranked according to
their performance under three di⁄erent forecast horizons: short, medium and long term.
Every week the BCB announces the Top 5 forecasters. Since our focus is on the current
month expectations, we use the short-term Top 5 forecasters in our exercise. Table 1
shows the results using OLS and Fixed E⁄ect estimators. The results for the coe¢ cient

10

of si;t are the same as those in the baseline estimation. The coe¢ cient of pi;t is positive,
but not signi(cid:133)cant, probably because the small number of observations in this exercise.

Second, we extended the full equation including some macroeconomic variables as
controls. As our identi(cid:133)cation strategy uses a two-day window, and the disclosure of
macroeconomic variables typically does not occur in such a high frequency, we do not
have many macroeconomic variables available to use as controls. But Table 1 reports

estimates using changes in the exchange rate (cid:0)(cid:1)ei;t = e0i;t (cid:0) ei;t(cid:1) and changes of swap
rate(cid:0)(cid:1)ri;t = r0i;t (cid:0) ri;t(cid:1) in the window around j(cid:3) as controls. The results are essencially

unchanged compared to the baseline. Also note that, since the macroeconomic variables
are not statistically signi(cid:133)cant, this exercise provides evidence in favor of our crucial
identifying assumption: that the only event causing changes in expectations in the window
around j(cid:3) is the Monitor release.

4.1.4 Placebo datasets

To provide evidence that previous results capture the impact of new information brought
by the Monitor on the update of expectations, and not the e⁄ect of any other event, we
replicate the baseline estimations using two placebo datasets. Here is essencial noting
that the Monitor on day j(cid:3) measures the in(cid:135)ation rate for the current month t. This
means that the Monitor is not a good signal for the in(cid:135)ation of the month t + k, such
as, for example, the third or the ninth month ahead.
In(cid:135)ation expectations for these
months should not be directly a⁄ected by the Monitor(cid:146)s informational content. Obviously
there are indirect e⁄ects, via in(cid:135)ationary inertia mechanisms, since higher in(cid:135)ation in

11

month t puts upward pressure on in(cid:135)ation in month t + k. But if the time horizon k is
long enough, the impact of inertia disappears. Thus, in our placebo experiment we use
in(cid:135)ation expectations of the third and the ninth month ahead.

Figure 3 shows the scatter plot of changes in in(cid:135)ation expectations for the third and
the ninth month ahead against our measure of new information brought by the Moni-
tor. Table 3 presents the estimates of the baseline speci(cid:133)cation using these two placebo
datasets. There is no evidence of impact from the "placebo new information" in either
case, suggesting that previous results are not due to chance or any other event.

4.2 Nonlinear estimations

In this subsection we explore the possibility of nonlinearities in the updating behavior of
forecasters(cid:146)expectations. First, from the theoretical point of view, the model of section 2
predicted that new information would have a nonlinear impact on the updating process,
which depends on the precision of the signal. In addition, from the empirical viewpoint,

 .2 .10.1.2.3Change in expectations .6 .4 .20.2.4.6New information3th month ahead .2 .10.1.2Change in expectations .4 .20.2.4.6New information9th month aheadFigure 2 shows a mass of points concentrated around zero, indicating that there may be
di⁄erent updating behavior depending on whether agents receive a signal that is very
close or too far from their current expectations. In which follows we explore these two
possibilities.

To test the nonlinear e⁄ect suggested by the theoretical model, we use the baseline
dataset to estimate a formulation more close to equation (6), introducing the interaction
term pi;tsi;t:

(cid:1)(cid:25)e

i;t = (cid:13)0 + (cid:13)2si;t + (cid:13)1pi;tsi;t + ci + "i;t:

(9)

We assume that the unobserved individual components ci are not correlated with the
error term and use the pooled OLS method to estimate the equation, adopting a robust
variance-covariance matrix to deal with autocorrelation in the residuals. The estimates
presented below support the nonlinear impact predicted by the theoretical model. The
coe¢ cient of the cross term pi;tsi;t is quantitatively signi(cid:133)cant. The estimate is also
statistically signi(cid:133)cant as well as the parameter of the si;t term. These results thus provide
clear evidence that when precision increases, agents put more weight on the piece of new
information received, and, consequently, more strongly agents respond changing their
forecasts. In summary, the higher the precision of new information, the higher the size of
the update.

To explore the e⁄ect suggested by Figure 2 we use a di⁄erent strategy. Since the
possible nonlinearity seems to come from the size of the surprise, we use a threshold
model to test the existence of two states:

(cid:1)(cid:25)e

i;t =(cid:2)(cid:13)1

0 + (cid:13)1

2si;t(cid:3) I (qt < (cid:28) ) +(cid:2)(cid:13)2

0 + (cid:13)2

2si;t(cid:3) I (qt (cid:21) (cid:28) ) + "i;t;

13

(10)

where qt = jstj is the threshold variable; I (:) is an indicator function that takes value
zero or one, depending on whether qt is larger or smaller than (cid:28); and (cid:28) is the threshold
value. In this type of models, the sample is divided in parts based on the value of an
observed variable(cid:151) if it surpasses or not the threshold value. The model is estimated in
two stages. First, the threshold value is estimated using a search grid, minimizing the
sum of squared residuals. In the second stage, conditional on the estimated threshold, the
sample is divided and the other parameters are estimated by OLS (see Franses and Van
Dijk, 2000, Caner and Hansen, 2004).

To avoid problems with having a model with an endogenous threshold variable, we
do not use as the variable determinig changes of states a function of si;t, which is our

explanatory variable. Instead, we de(cid:133)ne qt = jstj = jMt (cid:0) M ed(cid:0)(cid:25)e

is the median of expectations for the current month in(cid:135)ation considering all forecasters in
the BCB(cid:146)s survey when the Monitor is released. That is, the threshold variable captures
the size of the surprise considering all forecasters, which is measured by the absolute value
of the di⁄erence between the Monitor and the median of in(cid:135)ation expectations.

i;t(cid:1)j, where M ed(cid:0)(cid:25)e

Figure 4 in appendix A shows that the sum of squared residuals is clearly V-shaped,
indicating that the threshold value ((cid:28) = 0:12) is well estimated. The other parameters
of the model are presented in equation below. They strongly support the view of a
nonlinear e⁄ect of new information on the updating behavior. The coe¢ cient of si;t is
highly statistically signi(cid:133)cant in both states. Point estimates suggest that the coe¢ cient
when the Monitor information produces a big surprise (qt (cid:21) 0:12) is almost the double
2 = 0:392) than when the Monitor is close to the market consensus about the in(cid:135)ation
((cid:13)2

5 Conclusions

Despite the importance of expectations in macro and microeconomic models, there is still
sparse empirical evidence about how people form their expectations, and how they change
their perception when new information arises. This paper contributes to the literature
by outlining a direct empirical test for the signi(cid:133)cance of the impact of new information
on the updating behavior of market experts(cid:146)in(cid:135)ation forecasts, exploring the release of a
signal about the in(cid:135)ation rate in Brazil.

Results for a panel of more than 100 professional forecasters indicate that agents
update immediately their expectations after the release of new information, but the mag-
nitude of the coe¢ cient is consistent with staggered updating of expectations. There is
also evidence that the precision of the signal received matters for the size of the update:
the impact increases when precision of new information is higher, consistent with Morris
and Shin(cid:146)s (2002) model. Another documented source of nonlinearity is the own size of
the surprise brought by the piece of new information.

A priority for further research should be exploring two aspects of our data that can
shed light on the updating behavior when individuals have partial information or groups
of individuals have di⁄erent information sets. First, it is important noting that our
identi(cid:133)cation strategy explored changes in expectations around dates in which the Monitor
released covered exactly the same reference period as the IPCA. But the Monitor is a daily
estimate for moving periods of 30 days. This means that in the days preceding the closing
of the reference period agents already have partial information about the in(cid:135)ation rate
to be captured by the Monitor (and by the IPCA) in that month, and probably react
to that information. Since this reaction happens before our iden(cid:133)tication window, it is
not captured and reduces our estimates. The e⁄ect of partial information is not explored
in this paper. Second, we have assumed that all agents receive the same piece of new
information. However, FGV o⁄ers a paid service in which subscribers have access to
Monitor in(cid:135)ation rate and a full set of detailed information. Further work is also needed
to explore di⁄erences in the updating behavior of these two groups of forecasters.
