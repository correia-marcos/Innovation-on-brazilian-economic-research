Abstract: Previous works emphasize the role of tax rates as the key feature of tax competition. 
This  paper  brings  into  attention  how  local  jurisdictions  jointly  consider  the  level  of  public 
provision  in  infrastructure  and  the  business  tax  rates  as  fiscal  instruments  to  compete  for 
capital. Using data for approximately 5,000 municipalities in Brazil over a seven-year period, 
we find strong evidence that tax competition is driven by both public input spending and tax 
rate  choices.  Our  main  findings  indicate  that  local  governments  react  to  tax  rate  cuts  from 
neighboring  jurisdictions  in three possible ways:  also cutting their tax rates, increasing their 
public infrastructure spending, or combining both strategies.

1.  Introduction 

 

There is a broad tax competition literature that approaches how local jurisdictions compete for 
business or corporate tax to attract mobile capital. This early literature emphasizes the role of 
government choices on tax rates as the key feature of tax competition. Most previous empirical 
work  suggests that the tax differential across  localities  causes higher competition  for capital 
and leads to lower business tax rates (see Devereux et al., 2008, for a comprehensive overview 
of the literature). 

Differently, some recent literature has noted that local governments can explore several fiscal 
instruments to influence capital  allocation. Specifically, some authors have emphasized  that 
local governments affect capital allocation by strategically choosing the business tax rate and 
the level of public input provision. Hindricks et al. (2008), for example, develop a two-stage 
model in which tax rate choices are considered strategic complements of local public provision. 
In  this  setting,  a  local  jurisdiction  anticipates  tax  competition,  and  in  equilibrium,  localities 
voluntarily underinvest in public provision in the first stage to smooth tax rate competition in 
the  next  stage.  This  model  contrasts  with  Keen  and  Marchand’s  (1997)  simultaneous  game 
framework in which local governments provide more investments to the more mobile agents 
(e.g., infrastructure for capital) in opposition to lower public spending for less mobile agents 
(e.g., local welfare services for residents). 

Recently, Hauptmeier et al. (2012) extend the standard model of tax competition by including 
public  input  investment  as  another  relevant  fiscal  instrument  used  by  a  local  jurisdiction  to 
attract  capital.  In  their  analysis,  governments  set both  policy  instruments  strategically,  such 
that  the  business  tax  rate  is  a  function  of  the  government’s  own  level  of  input  in  public 
investment and vice versa.1 The novelty in Hauptmeier et al.’s (2012) model is that now public 
infrastructure and business tax rate are jointly determined simultaneous variables. Empirically, 
this approach is very interesting since it also allows local governments to strategically interact 
with neighboring jurisdictions’ choices over tax rate and public inputs.  

In  this  paper,  we  apply  the  analytical  framework  developed  by  Hauptmeier  et  al.  (2012) to 
investigate how  local  jurisdictions  in  Brazil  jointly consider the  level of public provision  in 
infrastructure and the business tax rates as fiscal instruments to compete for capital. Using data 
for approximately 5,000 municipalities over a seven-year period, we find strong evidence that 
tax competition is driven by both public input spending and tax rate choices. The results suggest 
that municipalities mimic each other in business tax rate as well as in infrastructure spending. 
More interestingly, the results indicate that communities respond to neighboring tax rate cuts 
by increasing their own public infrastructure spending, or concurrently, municipalities respond 
to an increase in neighboring public input spending by cutting their own tax rates. 

Considering that not only the dependent variable (business tax rate) but also some explanatory 
variables  (public  input  expenditure)  from  neighboring  observations  can  be  spatially  lagged, 
this  paper  tackles  several  econometric  issues.  Different  from  Hauptmeier  et  al.  (2012),  we 
control  for  spatial  and  time  fixed  effects  and  estimate  a  community’s  tax  reaction  function 
using a spatial Durbin model (SDM). This method allows us to control for community-specific 

                                                             
1 This is true assuming that public consumption is also endogenous. See Hauptmeier et al. (2012) pp. 408 for a 
discussion.  More  recently,  Han  et  al.  (2017)  argue  that  tax  coordination  does  not  eliminate  infrastructure 
competition among local jurisdictions. The authors suggest that tax competition is “carried over” to infrastructure 
spending choices, which is in fact the only adjustment variable.

non-observable and invariant attributes, such as regional policies and institutional aspects, that 
can produce biased estimations in a cross-sectional approach (Elhorst, 2017). Additionally, we 
lag the dependent variable in a dynamic approach. Since previous literature on corporate tax 
suggests that tax rate does not change frequently, a dynamic model is more accurate to address 
high  persistence  over  time  (Redoano,  2007).  Finally,  we  compare  results  from  the  dynamic 
panel data to the cross-sectional approach, and we provide evidence that our main findings are 
robust and conservative compared to Hauptmeier et al.’s (2012) findings. 

To  discuss  capital  competition  in  Brazil,  this  paper  proceeds  as  follows.  Section  2  briefly 
discusses some hypotheses regarding spatial interaction of public input provision and business 
tax  rate  based  on  previous  literature.  Section  3  depicts  the  empirical  approach.  Section  4 
describes the Brazilian  institutional  framework. The results are shown  in Section 5. Finally, 
Section 6 presents the conclusion. 

 

2. Expected effects of local business tax and public input competition  

Early contributions to the business tax competition literature consider tax rate choice the main 
fiscal  tool  used  by  communities  to  compete  for  capital.  Differently,  based  on  the  works  of 
Wildasin  (1991)  and  Hindricks  et  al.  (2008),  Hauptmeier  et  al.  (2012)  suggest  that  local 
governments compete for mobile capital using a mix of fiscal instruments.  

Assuming a federation with two homogeneous jurisdictions, Hauptmeier et al. (2012, pp. 408-
409) build a model in which capital is perfectly mobile and fixed in supply and in which the 
public  input  improves  the  marginal  productivity  of  the  private  factor  of  production.  In  this 
framework, the objective function of local governments is to maximize welfare, which depends 
on total output, capital income, tax revenue and public input provision. In equilibrium, capital 
net return is equalized across communities. 

One interesting assumption of the model is that public input funding is not based on only capital 
taxes. Thus, governments can choose more than one policy instrument to compete for capital. 
In this context, the local decision on tax rate depends not only on the average tax rate but also 
on  the  public  input  spending  of  neighboring  jurisdictions.  Alternatively,  local  public  input 
spending  reacts  concurrently  to  the  average  tax  rate  and  the  infrastructure  spending  of 
neighboring  jurisdictions. The parameters of  interest are the slope of the tax rate and public 
input  reaction  functions,  as  in  the  general  functions  𝜏𝑖 = 𝑓𝜏(𝜏𝑗, 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑗)  and  𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑖 =
𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡(𝜏𝑗, 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑗).  

Thus,  the  model  of  Hauptmeier  at  al.  (2012)  provides  several  insights  on  the  strategic 
interactions of local communities to attract capital. The main implications are summarized in 
this section in four main hypotheses. Those hypotheses constitute the analytical foundation of 
our empirical analysis. 

Hypothesis 1: If a neighboring community cuts its tax rate, the optimal reaction is to decrease 
local taxes as well.  

The positive association between local tax rate and neighboring average tax rate has been noted 
by  several  authors  in  tax  competition  literature  (See  Brueckner,  2003  for  a  comprehensive 
discussion). In fact, this is the baseline hypothesis of tax mimicking literature. 

Hypothesis 2: If the neighboring community increases its supply of public inputs, a region will 
respond by spending more in inputs. 

 

3 

Previous  literature has approached public  input competition separately  from tax rate choice. 
Keen  and  Marchand  (1997),  for  example,  discuss  how  communities  tend  to  privilege 
productivity-enhancing public spending compared to public goods associated with the welfare 
of their citizens. Bucovetsky (2005) suggests that public  input competition  is different from 
other  fiscal  variables  because  of  agglomeration  effects  caused  by  skilled  works  and 
infrastructure quality. Differently, Hauptmeier at al. (2012) establish  an  interaction  between 
neighboring  input  spending  and  local  spending  within  a  community.  A  positive  slope  is 
expected  in  the  public  input  reaction  function  in  a  similar  fashion  to  the  tax  mimicking 
literature. 

Hypothesis  3:  If the  neighboring  community  increases  (decreases)  its tax  rate,  a  region  will 
respond by providing less (more) public input. 

Hypothesis 4: If the opponent provides more (less) public inputs, it is optimal to cut (increase) 
the tax rate. 

Hypotheses 3 and 4 are the main insights in Hauptmeier et al.’s (2012) model. The pioneering 
authors describe how local governments enact strategic behavior by simultaneously choosing 
tax  rate  and  public  input  spending  according  to  the  decisions  of  neighboring  jurisdictions 
concerning both instruments. In this framework, local jurisdictions compete for capital using 
tax  and  non-tax  instruments.  According  to  hypotheses  3  and  4,  a  negative  association  is 
expected  between  the  tax  rate  (or  public  input)  behavior  of  a  community  and  that  of  a 
neighboring  community.  Thus,  to  compensate  for  a  neighbor’s  tax  rate  cut,  a  community 
responds by  increasing public  input, or to counterbalance an  increase  in a  neighbor’s public 
input, the local community cuts its own tax rate. In the next sections, we detail the empirical 
approach to test these hypotheses and investigate the Brazilian institutional framework.  

 

3. Empirical approach 

In Hauptmeier et al. (2012), communities compete for capital considering tax rate and public 
input spending simultaneously. The strategic interactions between these fiscal instruments can 
be represented by two linearized reaction functions in a simultaneous system of equations as 
depicted below: 

 

𝜏𝑖 = 𝛾𝜏𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑖 + 𝛼𝜏 ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝜏𝑗 + 𝛽𝜏 ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑗 + 𝜑𝜏𝑋𝑖 + 𝑢𝑖  (1.1) 

 

𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑖 = 𝛾𝐼𝜏𝑖 + 𝛼𝐼 ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝜏𝑗 + 𝛽𝐼 ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑗 + 𝜑𝐼𝑋𝑖 + 𝜗𝑖  (1.2) 

 
where  τ  and  Input  indicate,  respectively,  the  business  tax  rate  and  the  local  public  input 
spending from community i in the tax reaction function (1.1) and in the input reaction function 
(1.2).  The  subscript  j  indicates  the  community’s  neighboring  jurisdictions.  The  parameters 
𝛴𝑤𝑖𝑗𝜏𝑗𝑡 and 𝛴𝑤𝑖𝑗𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑗𝑡 denote, respectively, the average neighboring tax rate and the average 
neighboring  input  spending  excluding  the  local  community  and  weighted  by  predetermined 
spatial matrix W. The term X represents the vector of control variables (including a constant) 

 

4 

in  both  equations.  Finally,  μ  and  ϑ  denote  the  residuals  in  the  tax  rate  and  input  reaction 
function, respectively.2  

The problem with the system of equations approach described in (1.1) and (1.2) is that to the 
best of our knowledge, as discussed by Klemm and Van Parys (2012, footnote 14 pp. 400), the 
only econometric approach available  for spatial simultaneous relations  is the cross-sectional 
estimator, developed by Kelejian and Prucha (2004) and used in Hauptmeier et al. (2012) 

Another possible strategy considers a spatial panel model in which each reaction function (1.1 
and 1.2) can  be estimated separately.  Thus, to investigate  both the  interaction  effects of  the 
neighboring jurisdictions on the tax rate and on the public input spending of jurisdiction i; it is 
possible to use the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM). In terms of the tax reaction function (1.1), 
we have the SDM specification (2.1): 

𝜏𝑖𝑡 = 𝜆 ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑡𝜏𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝜃 ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑡𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑗𝑡 + 𝜑𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜎𝑡 + 𝑐𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡  

(2.1) 

where the term t indicates the time period.  The terms ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑡𝜏𝑗𝑡 (and ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑡𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑗𝑡 ) capture the 
interaction effect of business tax rate (input spending) in jurisdiction i with respect neighboring 
jurisdictions j and own’s jurisdiction (i) reaction to neighboring (j). Both terms are weighted 
by  the  spatial  matrix  W.  Additionally,  𝑋𝑖𝑡  indicates  a  vector  of  exogenous  covariates,  ci 
indicates a spatial fixed effect and 𝜎𝑡indicates a time fixed effect.  

Similarly, function 2.2 brings the public input spending reaction function as: 

 

𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑡 = 𝜆 ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑡𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑗𝑡 +   𝛽𝜏𝑗𝑡 + 𝜃 ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑡𝜏𝑗𝑡 + 𝜑𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜎𝑡 + 𝑐𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 

(2.2) 

 

As discussed in Elhorst (2014a), unlike non-spatial models, the coefficient estimate in the SDM 
is not exactly the marginal effects of a change in the explanatory variables. In terms of function 
(3.1), a change  in a specific  jurisdiction  i associated with  infrastructure spending affects the 
own  community  tax  rate  (direct  effect)  and  can  affect the  tax  rate  in  all  other  communities 
indirectly (spillover effect). The novelty here is that, compared to Hauptmeier et al. (2012), the 
direct  effect  includes  feedback  effects  that  arise  as  a  result  of  impacts  passing  through 
neighboring units (units j) and back to the unit that the change originated from (unit i). These 
feedback  effects  are  partly  due  to the  coefficient of  the  spatially  lagged  dependent  variable 
(𝑊𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑗𝑡)  and  partly  due  to  the  coefficient  of  the  spatially  lagged  value  of  the  explanatory 
variable itself (𝑊𝑖𝑡𝑋𝑗𝑡) (Elhorst, 2014a; LeSage and Pace, 2009). Thus, to obtain the marginal 
effect  on  the  dependent  variable,  one  should  take  the  derivatives  from  the  reduced  form  of 
function (3.1).3 

(R.1) 

                                                             
2 We note that the simultaneous approach allows for cross-sectional interdependence in the residuals as described 
in R.1 and R.2: 
𝑢𝑖 = 𝜌𝑢∑𝑗𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑢𝑗 + 𝜖𝑖 
𝜗𝑖 = 𝜌𝑣∑𝑗𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑣𝑗 + 𝜀𝑖 
where  ρ  accounts  for  spatial  correlation  in  each  function  and  ɛ  and  ϵ  are  assumed  to  be  error  terms  that  are 
independently and identically distributed.  
3 In fact, someone should consider the matrix of partial derivatives of the expectation of the dependent variable, 
with respect to the kth explanatory variable in unit 1 up to unit N. The diagonal and off-diagonal elements of this 
relation indicates the direct and spillover effects, respectively. In the SDM it follows  (𝐼 − 𝜌𝑊)−1[𝛽𝑘 + 𝑊𝜃𝑘]. 
Differently, the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) model does not tackle the spillover effect and  the direct effect is 

(R.2)

We  also  estimate  fiscal  a  dynamic  version  of  functions  (3.1)  and  (3.2)  including  a  lagged 
dependent variable (the term it-1) in the model, as also we run a standard spatial autoregressive 
(SAR) model, without the spatial lag of the explanatory variable. As the SAR model does not 
use the additional matrix W in the explanatory variable, the spillover effect is obtained from a 
common multiplier over the explanatory variables (LeSage and Pace, 2009). We estimate both 
SDM  and  SAR  models  using  a  maximum  likelihood  estimator  (MLE).  We  discuss  the 
robustness of our findings in Section 5.1 (Results). Next, subsection 3.1 describes the spatial 
weight matrix used in functions 1 to 3.  

 

3.1  

Spatial Matrix 

To capture the effects of community j on the reaction function of community i, we consider a 
standard contiguity matrix (Wij) in which the bordering communities are considered neighbors. 
The  weight  Wij  is  uniformly  distributed  according  to  the  number  of  total  neighboring 
communities  and  standardized  to  create  rows  summing  to  one  for  each  community  i 
(∑ 𝑊𝑖𝑗 = 1)

 as depicted in function (4): 

𝑖≠𝑗

𝑤𝑖𝑗 =

𝑉𝑖𝑗

∑

𝑘≠𝑖

𝑉𝑖𝑘

  (4) 

 
where  Vij  indicates  the  j  neighbor  of  community  i  and  assumes  the  value  of  one  if  the 
communities are contiguous and zero otherwise. The contiguity matrix should capture spatial 
interdependence and potential spillover effect from tax rate choices and public input spending 
across the local community and its neighbors. In the next section, we describe the institutional 
framework and how we collect data from Brazilian municipalities. 

 

4. Brazil Institutional Framework and Data 

Brazil is a federation composed of three different levels of government, namely, federal, state 
and  municipality.  Municipalities  are  the  lowest  tier  of  government.  There  were  5565 
municipalities  in  26  states  in  the  year  2015.  Although  municipalities  are  autonomous  in 
political  and  administrative  terms,  they  have  weak  fiscal  autonomy.  In  fact, there  is  a  great 
fiscal  imbalance  between  the  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  government.  Meanwhile,  the  federal 
budget accounts for approximately two-thirds of total public revenues, but it makes up less than 
half of total expenses on public services, such as health and education. 

Local government depends strongly on non-conditional grants  from the central government. 
Differently  from  most  federations,  there  is  not  an  equalization  grant  system  that  produces 
incentive effects in the tax base; e.g., an increase in communities’ efforts to collect taxes tends 
to  negatively  affect  how  much  they  obtain  from  equalization  grants.  Non-conditional  grant 
distribution across  municipalities  essentially  follows demographic criteria. In approximately 
97% of the municipalities, grant allocation depends on 17 populational cutoffs in which less 
populous  communities  obtain  more resources  per  capita than  more  populous  municipalities. 

                                                             
𝛽𝑘. In the SAR model it follows the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of (𝐼 − 𝜌𝑊)−1𝛽𝑘.  See Halleck Vega and 
Elhorst (2015) pp. 345, for a discussion. 

 

6 

On average, resources from states and central government represent approximately two-thirds 
of municipalities’ total revenues. 4 

Regarding local expenditures, budget allocation must respect legal rules on minimal spending 
(bottom limits). According to Brazilian legislation, municipalities should spend at least 25% 
of their budget (total revenues) on elementary and secondary educational services and at least 
15%  on  health  services.5  Additionally,  local  public  provision  includes  the  maintenance  of 
recreational  areas,  such  as  parks  and  squares,  and  public  infrastructure  investment,  such  as 
garbage collection, public transportation (excluding subway), street repair and lighting, as well 
as pavement, bridge and tunnel  maintenance. According to  Afonso et  al. (2005, pp. 29), the 
local government is responsible for approximately 85% and 25% of total public spending in 
urbanism and transportation, respectively. Thus, we consider as public infrastructure spending 
per  capita  the  total  community  expenditure  in  urbanism,  transportation  and  energy.  Those 
expenses  should  capture  jurisdictions’  investments  in  street  and  road  maintenance,  street 
lighting and public transportation. 

With respect to local taxes, municipalities collect two main taxes: business tax and property 
tax.  Municipality  taxes  represent  on  average  only  20%  of  their  total  revenues.  The  local 
business tax is applied by local services that do not trade goods directly, such as restaurants, 
cafeterias,  hairdressers,  vehicle  repair,  travel  agencies,  private  health  care,  financial  and 
education services. Retailers such as gas stations and market chains collect VAT but not the 
business tax. The business statutory tax rate ranges from 2% to 5% and is set by federal law. 
Tax rates vary by economic sector.6  

It is noteworthy that, different from most countries in Europe and North America, property tax 
in Brazil is not a very important source of revenues for municipalities. General statutory tax 
rate is very low (less than 2%), and there are many households that are tax exempt. According 
to Carvalho (2009), from 2002 to 2005, on average, only 30% of households paid property tax, 
and property tax accounts for less than 0.5% of gross domestic product (GDP). In our sample, 
revenues from business tax rate are two times larger than revenues from property tax.  

Therefore, it seems appropriate to consider that the business tax constitutes the main tax that 
municipalities  can  choose  to  attract  capital.  Regarding  public  infrastructure,  how  public 
investment can be capital enhancing to small- and mid-sized firms is less straightforward. It is 
expected that local infrastructure is positively associated with commuting and that the demand 
of local services should benefit from better public input. Additionally, public urban structure 
can impact the costs of private services. Nevertheless, how capital location responds to public 
infrastructure  spending  in  urbanization,  such  as  street  maintenance,  sidewalks,  lighting  and 
public  transportation,  is  an  empirical  question,  as  is  Hauptmeier  et  al.’s  (2012)  analysis  on 
German firms.  

A problem with business tax (and for property tax in Brazil) is that there is not a systematic 
compilation  of  the  tax  rate  across  the  5,655  municipalities  and  by  economic  sector.  To 
circumvent this problem, we follow Jacobs et al. (2010) and Hayashi and Boadway (2001), and 
we calculate the average effective tax rate (AETR) of the business tax. AETR is usually defined 
as the ratio of tax revenues to a firm’s total revenues or profits. We calculate the business AETR 
                                                             
4  In  Brazil,  VAT  and  vehicle  tax  are  states’  duty.  States  return  approximately  25%  of  total  revenues  to  the 
communities where the taxes were collected. Additionally, there are categorical grants for education and health. 
For a comprehensive description in English of grants in Brazil, see Shah (1991).  
5 It follows, respectively, Law nº 9424 de 1996 (Lei das Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Nacional  – LDB) and 
Emenda Constitucional 29/2000. 
6 It follows Lei Complementar 116/2003 and Emenda Constitucional 37/2002.

as the ratio of the total municipality revenue from business tax to the total direct value-added 
contribution  of  the  services  sector  to  municipality  gross  domestic  product.  We  note  that 
information on firms’ revenues is available for only the state level in the Brazilian Bureau of 
Economics  and  Statistics  (IBGE)  dataset.  Moreover,  considering  data  on  states,  the  direct 
value-added contribution presents a correlation above 80% with information on firms’ revenues 
in the services sector. Thus, we assume that this variable is representative of firms’ revenue. 

There are some advantages in using AETR instead of statutory tax rates in our context. First, 
AETR changes more frequently and is less rigid across time than statutory tax rates. Second, 
AETR  should  present  more tax  salience  than  statutory  tax  rates (e.g.,  firms  should  be  more 
concerned with the average tax burden between communities than with statutory rates). Third, 
AETR should capture the effect of the business tax rate over the fiscal base. Finally, data for 
calculating AETR are available on the IBGE. 

Following  previous  literature  on  tax  competition,  we  control  for  municipalities’  additional 
sources  of  revenues.  First,  we  collect  data on  unconditional  grants  that  communities  obtain 
from the central government. Additionally, we include municipalities’ annual current account 
balance  per  capita.  We  expect  that  higher  public  debt  should  negatively  impact  investment 
spending, such as infrastructure. Finally, we also control for some demographic characteristics 
such as municipalities’ share of  young and elderly, population size (level and squared term) 
density and whether the municipality is inside a metropolitan area or not.  

We  obtain  data  from  two  main  sources.  Data  on  the  public  spending  and  revenue  of 
municipalities  are  available  at  the  Finanças  do  Brasil  (FINBRA)  dataset  provided  by  the 
National Secretary of the Treasury. Information on number of firms in the services sector by 
municipality  is  available  at  the  Cadastro  Central  de  Empresas  (CEMPRE)  provided  by  the 
Brazilian Bureau of Economics and Statistics (IBGE). We also collect additional information 
on  economic  and  demographic  variables  from  the  IBGE.  All  monetary  variables  are  in 
Brazilian Reais (R$) and are deflated to their real values  in 2010 using a national consumer 
index. Data are not available for all 5,565 Brazilian municipalities in the same number of time 
periods.  For  this  reason,  we  build  a  balanced  panel  with  information  from  2006  to  2012 
considering 5004 communities.

medium-sized firms. Regarding demographic variables, municipalities present on average 34 
thousand inhabitants, and of the total population, approximately 27% are under fifteen years 
old, and 11% are above sixty years old. It is important to note that the share of infrastructure 
spending is quite low compared to municipalities’ total spending. On average, infrastructure 
spending per capita accounts for only 14% of the total local budget, but it represents 81% of 
public investment spending. Next, we present the results for the methodological approach for 
tax and public input interaction across communities in Brazil. 

 

5. Spatial Panel Data Results 

Table  2  shows  the  main  results  regarding  Brazilian  municipalities’  reaction  function  on 
neighboring  tax  rate  choice.  Following  function  (3.1),  columns  I  and  II  present  the  ML 
estimator results for, respectively, a static and a dynamic Spatial Durbin Model (SDM). The 
main difference between the two specifications is that the latter controls for higher persistence 
in  the  dependent  variable,  as  also  allows  to  estimate  short-term  effects  of  the  lagged 
explanatory  variable  (public  input  spending).  As  a  robustness  check,  column  III  brings  the 
results of the SDM specification with two additional covariates: unconditional grants, and per 
capita public debt. Column IV brings the results for a dynamic spatial autoregressive (SAR) 
model without the spatial lagged explanatory variable in the public input variable.  

As discussed in Section 3, the coefficients estimated in the SDM are not exactly the marginal 
effects  of  a  change  in  the  explanatory  variables.  We  focus  our  discussion  on  the  direct  and 
indirect  effect  for our  variables  of  interest.  In  addition  to  control  for  spatial  and  time  fixed 
effects, we add demographic characteristics as size of population (also squared population), 
population  density,  share  of  young  and  share  of  elderly.  All  results  bring  the  estimation 
outcomes for a row-standardized contiguity matrix. 

We  begin  our  analysis  looking  at  the  coefficients  of  the  tax  rate  and  public  input  spending 
variables. First, note that the estimated coefficients for neighboring tax rates are positive and 
significant for all specifications, ranging from 0.51 to 0.64. In fact, an estimated coefficient of 
0.56  (column  II)  suggests  that  an  average  tax  increase  of  one  percentage  point  among 
neighboring  municipalities  is  associated  with  a  0.56  percentage  point  increase  in  the  local 
community tax rate. This result indicates a spatial spillover effect on communities’ business 
tax rate, as discussed in hypothesis 1 from Section 2. Interestingly, the estimated coefficient 
for the spillover effect on tax rate is similar but a bit larger in the SDM specifications compared 
to the SAR model. 

Additionally,  we  note  that  the  coefficient  on  the  lagged  tax  rate  variable  is  positive  and 
significant  for  all  dynamic  specifications  (Columns  II  to  IV).  This  finding  suggests  that 
business tax rate presents persistence over time or, similarly, that communities with a high tax 
rate in period t tend to set a high tax rate also in the next period.

Regarding direct impacts, observe that in Column II (Dynamic SDM), the long run coefficient 
estimate of 0.0074 on public input spending per capita (per $ 100 Reais) is different from the 
direct effect estimate of 0.0099. Considering this  difference, that  suggests that  local tax rate 
would  increase  by  approximately  0.025  percentage  points  due  (positive)  feedback  effects, 
which amounts to approximately 25% of the direct effect. LeSage and Pace (2009) notes that 
these  occur  since  the  municipality  is  considered  a  neighbor to  its  neighbor, thus  the  effects 
passing through neighboring jurisdictions will generate an influence (feedback effect) on the 
jurisdiction itself. Importantly, these feedbacks effects originated from the own tax rate are not 
so small (in our sample, the average tax rate is approximately 1.6%) and suggest a significant 
impact passing through to neighboring municipalities and back to the own jurisdiction. In the 
SAR model (Column IV), the feedback effect presents a similar magnitude of approximately 
26% of the direct effect. Differently, in the static SDM (Colum I) the difference between the 
direct effect estimate and the coefficient estimate is very small, approximately only 0.0001 (we 
come back to this finding below).

All regressions include municipality and time fixed effects.We use the variation of 500 simulated parameter combinations drawn from the multivariate normal distribution implied by the ML estimates.   *** Significant at 1%, **  significant at 5%, * significant at 10%.However,  whereas  results  in  Table  2  suggest  that  a  change  in  infrastructure  spending  in  a 
municipality presents a positive effect in the business tax rate in the municipality itself, we also 
find that the neighboring public input spending presents a negative spillover (indirect) effect in 
municipality’s tax rate in both SDM specifications. In particular, those results indicate that an 
increase of 1000 Reais per capita in the neighboring jurisdiction infrastructure causes a 0.02 
percentage points decrease on business tax rate of municipality i. Again, the spillover effect is 
larger in the dynamic specification.  

Thus, in Column II, results for the total effect (summing up direct and indirect effect) indicate 
that for each additional investment of 1000 Reais per capita in local public input, local tax rate 
would increase (in the long run) by approximately 0.08 percentage points. Results suggests that 
indirect effect reduces the direct impact around 20%. Moreover, the spillover effect is around 
four times smaller than the direct effect. According to (Elhorst, 2014b), it is expected that the 
impact of a change will probably be larger in the jurisdiction that provoked the change.  

Regarding short term, our estimations for direct effects of infrastructure spending are smaller 
than  long  term  counterparts.  It  seems  reasonable  to  assume  that  that  takes  time  to  the 
municipality’s infrastructure spending fully influence own tax rate. Surprisingly, the short-term 
spillover effect is similar to the long term estimated effect (-0.0017 and -0.0019, respectively). 
These  results  suggest that  while  municipality  takes  longer  to  increase  its own tax  rate,  own 
jurisdictions reacts faster to an increase in neighboring infrastructure spending by cutting their 
tax rate. Additionally, the long-term effects (both direct and indirect) are greater in the dynamic 
SDM compared to the static model. This result points out that the static model underestimates 
long term effects, and the potential bias is more severe for the direct effect than for the spillover 
effect for this case. 

On the other hand, it is noteworthy to point out that in the SAR model, although the estimated 
direct effect is very close to the SDM model, the indirect effect is not. In fact, results in Column 
IV reveals a positive and significant spillover effect for an increase in neighboring public input 
spending on own tax rate. This result contradicts hypothesis 4 from our analytical framework 
as  also  the  SDM  results.  In  fact,  it  seems  that  the  SAR  model  fails  to  proper  estimate  the 
spillover  effect  because  it  does  not  consider  the  spatial  lagged  term  in  its  functional  form.  
Compared to the SDM model, the main drawback of the SAR specification is that it does not 
consider the heterogeneous impact from a change in the explanatory variable (public input) in 
total effects (see discussion in Section 3). 

Finally, as in previous works on tax competition, Column III brings the results for the SDM 
regression with two additional covariates: grants and current account balance. Compared to our 
baseline  model,  results  indicate  a  significant  decrease  in  the  direct  long  run  effect  estimate 
(from 0.099 to 0.035), although there is still a positive feedback effect. Interestingly, results in 
Column III suggest that the spill-over effect represents around 70% of the direct effect (versus 
20% in Column II). It  is  important to  note that in all three SDM specifications the spillover 
effect is solid: it presents the expected sign, is significant and similar. Moreover, the inclusion 
of covariates associated to jurisdictions’ revenues increases the explanatory power of the model 
(R squared increases from 0.12 to 0.20). 

Elhorst (2014a) notes that, in general, several researches fail to reject the null hypothesis that 
the  coefficients  of  the  spatially  lagged  explanatory  variable  are  not  significant,  and 
concurrently,  do  not  obtain  a  significant  estimate  of  spillover  effect,  because  they  do  not 
observe  a  large  number  of  cases  over time  or  have only  cross-sectional  data.  However, one 
contribution of this paper is the number of units in our sample is quite large and leads us to 
estimate both direct and spillover effect in the dynamic SDM significantly at 5% level. 

 

11 

Overall, results in the SDM (Columns I to III) specifications suggest two forces at work that 
affect jurisdictions’ tax rate choice. First, there is a positive effect of infrastructure spending 
on own tax rate that is exacerbated by feedback effects. This result shows that, in some manner, 
further spending in infrastructure allows the community to increase the local tax rate without 
damaging capital competition. Second, whereas an increase in infrastructure spending present 
a  positive  impact  on  own  municipality  tax  rate,  it  causes  a  tax  rate  cut  in  neighboring 
jurisdictions.  This  last  result  suggests  that  the  municipality  can  try  to  counterbalance  an 
improvement in neighboring infrastructure conditions by cutting its own business tax rate.7 As 
predicted in hypothesis 4 from our analytical framework, if the neighbor municipality increases 
the public provision of inputs, the local jurisdiction reacts by cutting its tax rate.  

 

5.1 Cross Section Results and Robustness8 

In order to provide additional comparison, we present the results for a simultaneous equation 
model for cross-sectional data as in Hauptmeier et al. (2012). Thus, we take the average from 
our  seven-year  data  and  build  a  cross-section  version.  With  this  data,  we  re-estimate  the 
original model (functions 1.1 and 1.2) using a spatial system estimator as suggested by Kelejian 
and Prucha (2004). The generalized spatial two stage least squares (GS2SLS) approach consists 
of three steps (See Hauptmeier et al. (2012), Section 3.2 for details). We use again a normalized 
spatial contiguity matrix.  

Results using cross section data (GS2SLS) are on Table 39 The main difference here is that the 
cross-sectional approach considers that the effect of the neighboring tax rate and local public 
inputs  on  own  fiscal  decisions  are  jointly  determined.    In  fact,  LeSage  and  Pace  (2009) 
emphasize that  spatial cross-sectional  model and spatial panel data model can produce quite 
different  estimates  coefficients,  even  if  both  approaches  are  properly  specified.  Meanwhile 
cross-sectional data tend to underline spatial dependence, spatial panel model could indicate 
relatively greater temporal dependence than spatial temporal dependence.10 

 

                                                             
7 We note that inter-jurisdiction investments in infrastructure are federal or state responsibilities. Thus, potential 
externality effects should not be driven by communities’ own spending. 
8  In  the  Appendix,  we  provide  the  results  with  infrastructure  spending  as  dependent  variable,  as  described  in 
function (2.2). Overall, we note that our main findings are maintained.  
9 We note that Hauptmeier et al. (2012) use as instrumental variable for the averaged values of neighboring tax 
rate  and  public  input  spending,  the  share  of  communities’  church  members  and  specific  grants  for  roads, 
respectively.  We  use  as  instrumental  variable  for  the  averaged  values  of  neighboring  business  tax  rate  and 
infrastructure spending, respectively: the share of local workers and the share of elderly; and the share of workers 
and per capita sales tax grants (from States). The 2SLS approach is done in Stata using the spivreg command as 
developed by Drukker et al. (2013). 
10 Since a cross-sectional spatial model does not provide an explicit role for the passage of time, it emphasizes the 
change in the relationship between independent and dependent variable moving to a new steady-state equilibrium. 
See Lega and Pace (2009) Section 7.2 for a discussion. 

 

 

12 

Overall, estimated coefficients on neighboring tax rate are similar to the estimations in Table 
2. On the tax rate function, results indicate a positive and significant coefficient of 0.66 for the 
tax  interaction  parameter.  Since  the  cross-sectional  approach  does  not  control  for  the 
persistence overtime, it is expected a higher coefficient estimation for this variable in a static 
approach compared to its dynamic counterpart (0.66 against 0.56, respectively). 

More important, Table 3 shows that an increase of 1000 Reais per capita in local infrastructure 
spending would rise local tax rate around 0.074 percentage points. Moreover, results suggest

0.033 percentage point fall in community’s own tax rate.  

Comparing  results  from  cross-section  estimations  to  Table  2,  one  notes  that  cross-section 
model  results  indicate a  larger estimated  spillover effect regarding neighboring spending on 
community’ tax rates (0.003 versus 0.002) but a lower total effect (0.007 versus 0.008) for own 
community’s public spending on  business tax rate. Those differences (positive and  negative 
bias, respectively) could be associated to time effects or feedback effects that are not captured 
in the cross-section approach. 

However,  it  is  important to  point  out that  all  the  estimated  coefficient  for  fiscal  interaction 
parameters present the signal as predicted by Hauptmeier et al. (2012) model as discussed in 
Section 2. The own input spending is positively associated to tax rate (column I) as well vice 
versa  (column  II).  Overall,  our  results  reinforce  the  idea  that  strategic  interaction  in  capital 
competition, different from previous research, depends not only on tax rate interaction among 
communities but also on fiscal variables related to capital investment, such as local spending 
on public infrastructure. 

 

6. Conclusion 

There is  much theoretical and empirical literature on capital tax competition. However, only 
recently has this literature incorporated the idea that tax competition between localities depends 
on several fiscal variables such as tax rate and the provision of public input. In this paper, we 
explore Hauptmeier at  al.’s (2012)  framework to investigate spillover effects in tax rate and 
public  infrastructure  across  local  communities  in  Brazil.  Our  data  include  information  on 
approximately 5000 municipalities for a seven-year period. 

The novelty here is that we consider a panel data approach in which it is possible to control for 
local fixed effects and to incorporate a dynamic component. Using separated regressions with 
business tax rate and public input spending as dependent variables confirm Hauptmeier at al.’s 
(2012) hypothesis. In fact, the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) produces greater spillover effect 
compared to the cross-section model. Our main findings indicate that local governments adjust 
their tax rate  based  not only on the tax rate of the neighboring communities  but also on  the 
neighbors’ public input spending. Importantly, this paper presents strong evidence that local 
governments react to tax rate cuts from neighboring jurisdictions in three possible ways: also 
cutting  their  tax  rates,  increasing  their  public  infrastructure  spending, or  combining  the two 
strategies.  The  results  confirm  that,  in  Brazil,  local  public  infrastructure  seems  to  be  very 
important  in  fiscal  competition.  This  new  evidence  is  probably  valid  for  other  regions  with 
similar characteristics.

APPENDIX 

Table A.1 presents regressions on public input spending per capita as the dependent variable. 
Although,  the  analytical  reference  in  tax  competition  suggests  that  infrastructure  spending 
leads to tax rate changes, we also test the opposite to verify the robustness of our findings.  
Different from previous estimates on tax rate, results in Table A.1 suggests  less evidence of 
persistence over time. In fact, the lagged public input spending is significant (columns II and 
III), but the magnitude of the coefficient is lower than the coefficient for the lagged tax rate 
(estimated  average  of  0.17  against  0.27  in  Table  2). This  finding  suggests  that  public  input 
spending is more volatile (less persistent) over time compared to business tax rate. 
Additionally,  Table  A.1  points  out  that  a  change  in  business  tax  rate  in  a  municipality  is 
positively associated to the public input spending in that jurisdiction. Regarding direct impacts, 
we note that in Column II (Dynamic SDM), the long run direct effect estimate of $ 1417 Reais 
on business tax rate is somewhat different from the coefficient estimate of $ 1203 Reais. Since 
our  effect estimate  is superior to the coefficient estimate, this result  indicates that the direct 
effect on  local  infrastructure spending  is approximately $ 200 Reais  larger due to (positive) 
feedback effects.  
Regarding indirect effects, similarly to our previous results (on business tax rate as dependent 
variable),  results  in  the  SDM  regression  also  indicate  a  negative  spillover  effect,  but  in  this 
case, the indirect effect  is not significant. According to results in column II, one percentage 
point  increase  in  neighboring’s  tax  rates  leads  to  a  decrease  of  about  $  116  Reais  on 
infrastructure on own municipality. This result is an evidence in favor of hypothesis 3, if the 
opponent cuts its tax rate, it is optimal to the own community to provide more public inputs.  
Thus, in Column II, results for the total effect (summing up direct and indirect effect) indicate 
that for an additional increase of one percentage point in local tax rate, public input spending 
would rise around $ 1301 Reais per capita. Interestingly, compared to the regressions in Table 
2, the spillover effect here is much smaller and not significant: approximately 12 times smaller 
than the direct effect (in the regressions with tax rate as dependent variable, the indirect effect 
is  four  times  smaller  than  the  direct  effect).  These  results  reinforce  the  idea  that  the  causal 
relationship is stronger from public input to tax rate than the opposite. 
As in the case with the business tax rate as dependent variable, in the SAR model, although the 
estimated direct effect is similar to the SDM model, the indirect effect suggests the opposite. 
Results in the SAR model in Column III indicates a positive and significant spillover effect on 
public input spending. This result contradicts SDM results and hypothesis 3 from our analytical 
framework.  
Interestingly, results on Column II suggest that short term spillover effects are fair greater than 
long term effects. Similarly to our findings in Table 2, one possible interpretation to this result 
is that neighboring jurisdictions reacts faster to an increase in business tax rate than the own 
tax jurisdiction. 
Finally, comparing Table A.1 to Table 3, we find that coefficients for the tax rate parameters 
in the spatial panel regressions are fairly different from the GS2SLS regression. Coefficients 
are  approximately  four  to  five  times  greater  in  cross-sectional  approach  compared  to SDM. 
These differences suggest that infrastructure spending is more susceptible to time effects.
