Abstract 

Taking into account the pull-push debate on the weight that external or internal factors have on the behavior 
of capital flows and country-risk premium of  developing economies, the aim of this article is to  assess 
empirically the extent by which the push factors, linked to global liquidity and interest rates (compared to 
country-specific factors), play on the changes in the risk premium of a set of countries of the periphery, in 
the period 1999-2019. This done using the methodology of Principal Component Analysis, which can relate 
the information from different countries to its common sources. We also test for a structural change in the 
premium  risk  series  in  2003,  by  means  of  structural  break  tests.  We  find  that  push  factors  do  play  the 
predominant role in explaining country risk changes of our selected peripherical countries and that there 
was indeed a substantial general reduction in country risk premia after 2003, confirming that the external 
constraints of the periphery were significantly loosened by more favorable conditions in the international 
economy in the more recent  period. The results are in line both with the view that cycles in peripherical 
economies  are  broadly  subordinated  to  global  financial  cycles,  in  but  also  that  such  external  conditions 
substantially improved compared to the 1990s.  

Key-words: country-risk premium, pull-push debate, external constraints, peripherical economies, global 
financial cycles. 

Resumo 

Levando em consideração o debate “pull-push” acerca do peso que fatores externos e internos têm sobre o 
comportamento dos fluxos de capital e o prêmio de risco das economias em desenvolvimento, o objetivo 
deste  artigo  é  avaliar  empiricamente  a  extensão  pela  qual  os  fatores  tipo  “pull”,  ligados  à    liquidez 
internacional e às taxas de juros externas (em contraposição a fatores específicos de cada país), influenciam 
nas mudanças do prêmio de risco de um conjunto de países da periferia no período de 1999-2019. Utiliza-
se a Análise de Componentes Principais, que pode sintetizar as informações de diferentes países a fatores 
comuns. Adicionalmente, testa-se a existência de uma mudança estrutural na série de prêmio de risco, por 
meio de testes de quebra estrutural. Descobrimos que fatores tipo “pull” desempenham papel predominante 
na  explicação  das  variações  do  prêmio  de  risco  de  países  periféricos  selecionados  e  que  houve  uma 
substancial  redução  geral  nos  prêmios  de  risco  após  2003,  confirmando  que  as  restrições  externas  da 
periferia  foram  significativamente  afrouxadas  por  condições  internacionais  mais  favoráveis  no  período 
mais recente. Os resultados estão alinhados com a visão de que os ciclos nas economias periféricas estão 
amplamente  subordinados  aos  ciclos  financeiros  globais  e  que  tais  condições  externas  melhoraram 
substancialmente em comparação com os anos 1990.

1. Introduction 

Since the 1990s, the reintegration of some developing countries (that had been excluded after the debt crises 
of the 1980s) to international financial markets has been a key feature to understand its economic cycles. 
Medeiros (2008) shows that from 1990 on, the economic cycles of peripheral countries, usually correlated 
to commodity prices, regain a financial aspect related to their integration to international financial markets. 
The liberalization of capital accounts and the consequent flow of capital became a new source of instability 
for these countries.  

From an  empirical perspective, the data from the 1990s raised a great debate over the main factors behind 
the flow of capital to developing economies (Hannan, 2018; Koepke, 2018). Indeed, the inspiration for this 
debate was the return of developing economies to international markets at the end of the 1980s (Calvo et 
al., 1993) and the first findings stressed the major role of external factors related to global liquidity (the 
also  called "push" factors). This   view was reinforced in  the 2000s when impressive flows of capital  to 
developing economies are observed again (Rey, 2015).  

The aim of this article is to inquire empirically to what extent the push factors linked to global liquidity 
play a major role (compared to  country-specific  factors) on the  changes in the  risk  premium of a set  of 
developing or “peripheral” economies in the period 1999-2019. The empirical motivation for the current 
investigation is given by Figure 1, which presents a strong correlation between a general measure of risk 
spread  expressed  by  the  EMBI+  and  the  specific  EMBI  Brazil3  risk  premium.  This  apparent  strong 
correlation is remarkable because the EMBI+ is composed by very different countries such as Brazil, Egypt 
and Malaysia. 

We test this connection between risk premium indicators by employing the Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA) as presented in Johnson and Wichern (2002) and Jolliffe (2002). According to this methodology, we 
try to find the fraction of the total variance of a set of sovereign risk series which can be explained by a 
subset of one or two principal components. We use the group of countries considered in the EMBI+ index 
for the period between January 1999 to January 2019. Depending on the size of this fraction, we may show 
the relative importance of common factors as determinant of the sovereign risk despite the differences in 
country-specific countries. The original use of this approach is found in Calvo et al. (1993).  

We also note in Figure 1 that both the EMBI+ and EMBI Brazil risk spreads seem to have been significantly 
reduced  after  2003  (in  spite  of  a  spike  around  the  time  of  the  global  financial  crisis).  So,  we  apply  a 
structural  break  test  in  order  to  test  for  changes  in  the  pattern  of  sovereign  risk  spreads  in  the  2000s. 
Moreover, we provide evidences that the common factors behind our set of country-risk premium can be 
explained by financial variables, namely the US interest rate, oil price and the VIX. 

                                                           
3  The  Emerging  Bond  Index  (EMBI+)  is  a  market  index  calculated  by  JP  Morgan  that  measures  the  difference  between  the 
interest rate on dollar denominated sovereign bonds issued by emerging economies and the US Treasuries of the same maturity. 
We will return to this definition in the next sections.

As the country risk premium can be considered as part of the floor to feasible  domestic interest rates under 
international capital mobility (Serrano and Summa, 2015), our results on its main determinants of sovereign 
risk  may  be  relevant  to  assess  the  level  of  financial  dependency  of  developing  economies  regarding 
international  financial  cycles.  Therefore, our  empirical  results reinforce the push literature in  the period 
1999-2019 and confirm empirically that the expansionary financial cycle in the 2000s (Akyüz, 2017; Freitas 
et al., 2016; Serrano, 2013) largely explain the fall in country-risk for selected developing economies.  

The paper is organized into five sections. After this introduction, the following section details the debate 
on pull-push factors on capital flows and the determinants of country-risk. In this section, we also discuss 
our  main  findings  on  country-risk  determinants  through  the  Principal  Component  Analysis.  The  third 
section provides an economic interpretation  of the previous results and how the changes in  the selected 
country-risk premium are related to changes in external financial conditions in the 2000s. The final section 
concludes the paper.  

 

 

2. Country risk determinants 

2 .1. The pull-push literature 

Calvo et al. (1993) note that the resumption of the flow of foreign capital to Latin American countries in 
the early 1990s occurs broadly, after the interruption in the middle of the previous decade. This fact seemed 
puzzling for these authors, since capitals return to flow into different developing countries, not just those 
who had supposedly adopted the reform agenda advocated in the period4. The amount of capital that flowed 
into the Latin American countries in the form of direct foreign investments and investments in portfolios 
reached US$ 670 billion in the period 1990-94 and it was five times the same amount that flowed in the 
period  1984-89  (Calvo  et  al.,  1996). When  analyzing  the  dynamics  of  variables  such  as  international 
reserves, real exchange rate and inflation for ten Latin American countries5, Calvo et al., (1993) found that 

                                                           
4 The reform agenda, such as privatizations, financial liberalization, and fiscal adjustment were part of the conditionalities of 
the IMF and World Bank lending packages. For a review see Taylor (1997).

indicators. The authors also found correlation among the co-movement of these factors and the recession 
of the US economy in the early 1990s, as well as the FED interest rate reduction process initiated in the 
second half of 1989. 

Based on Calvo et al. (1993) findings, Fernandez-Arias (1996) and Taylor and Sarno (1997) proposed to 
control  the  inflow  of  capital  in  the  emerging  economies  by  domestic  factors.  Calvo  et  al.  (1993)  also 
inspired several empirical studies with the aim to measure the role of external or internal factors prevailing 
in  explaining  the  resumption  of  capital  flows  to  Latin  America  in  the  1990s  –  also  known  as pull-push 
debate. As  described  by  the  survey  of  Koepke (2018) for  those  who  defended  the  prevalence 
of push factors, the reasons for the resumption of the capital flow would be the fall of the Fed's interest rate 
and the recession in the US economy at the beginning of the 1990s. However, over the same decade, the 
Fed's interest rate has risen again, and the US economy recovered, but the capital flows to Latin America 
did  not  fall. In  this  context, those  who  defend  the  predominance  of  domestic  factors  to  determine  the 
attraction of capital gained some space. Associated with these factors would be the situation of the external 
accounts,  the  commercial  and  financial  opening  and,  according  to  them,  the  adjustment  of  the  public 
accounts. However, the indiscriminate capital inflows to different Latin American economies throughout 
the  1990s  suggests  that  domestic  factors  hardly  explain  the  capital  flow  on  their  own  (Koepke, 
2018). Moreover,  throughout  the  literature,  the  domestic  factors  commonly  found  as  being  empirically 
significant were those associated with the situation of the external accounts of each country, which reflect 
the external vulnerability of developing economies. Hannan (2018) lists the domestic factors often put forth 
by the pull literature: trade liberalization, international reserves, exchange rate regime, institutional quality, 
per  capita  income,  capital  account  opening  and  financial  market  development -  and  none  of  them  are 
associated with fiscal policy choices. 

In  the  2000s,  after  the  international  financial  crisis  and  the  consequent  monetary  easing  in  the  US  and 
Europe,  the push side regained  strength,  as  seen,  for  example,  in  Bruno  and  Shin  (2013) and 
Rey (2015). For these authors, the monetary policy of the central economies is the main determinant of the 
global financial cycles. Thus, these studies seek to measure empirically the consequences of FED interest 
shocks on global risk perception and the international liquidity levels. An initial negative (positive) shock 
in the US interest rate may change the perception of global risk by itself and this movement triggers a wave 
of capital inflows (outflows) in emerging economies. This type of analysis is strongly connected with the 
sharp fall of interest rates in the central economies after 2009.  

It is worth noting that the pull-push literature was concerned not only with the measurement of capital flow 
determinants  but  also  with  its  impact  on  the  macroeconomic  variables  in  the  countries  analyzed.  This 
literature, from Calvo et al. (1993) to Rey (2015), sought to observe the impact of the international capital 
flow in  the  series  of  foreign  exchange,  reserves,  bank  credit,  asset  prices,  and  stock  market 
performance. Hence,  it  was  tried  to evaluate  how  the  global  financial  cycle  could  impact  the  national 
economies.  The main concern of these authors was also to propose a policy recommendation for countries 
with  external  vulnerability  related  to  financial  cycles. Rey  (2015) argues that  the  supposed  impossible 
trinity (or trilemma) is in fact a dilemma: given that global liquidity is the main factor determining the flow 
of external capitals to developing countries, the choice is simply between the autonomy of monetary policy 
or the free mobility of capital, regardless of the exchange rate regime adopted. For this literature, the way 
in  which  international  financial  cycles  are  absorbed  locally  imposes  the  need  for  capital  control  in 
developing economies. 

The pull-push debate interests us to the extent that the sovereign risk premium reflects the appetite of non-
resident  investors  to  apply  their  resources  in  developing  economies. Since  the  country-risk  premium,  in 
addition to the foreign interest rate and the expected devaluation of the exchange rate, define the floor for 
the domestic interest rate, its variation is central to understand the inflow/outflow of capital in developing 
economies. Therefore, we approach the pull-push controversy through the analysis of the determinants of 
the country-risk premium.

The literature on the determinants of sovereign  risk for  Latin America countries is much influenced   by 
Blanchard (2004),  which  proposes    a  link  between  domestic  factors  (fiscal  indicators)  and  the  level  of 
country risk. Gupta et al. (2008) recognizes that the empirical literature linking country risk to fiscal policy 
is limited, but they try to demonstrate from a panel of thirty countries between 1997 and 2007 that levels 
of public deficit and debt are indicators of sovereign default. Thus, the authors try to show that these fiscal 
variables negatively affect the level of country risk. Using a panel data from 1998 to 2002 with 66 countries, 
Canuto et al. (2012) seeks to identify the variables that can explain the risk assessment by rating agency 
scores6. As a result, the authors find statistical significance in the gross public debt variable as a percentage 
of public revenues to explain the country risk scores. 

On the other side, there are authors who find co-movements for different series of country risk in emerging 
economies, which can be interpreted as push factors for the flow of capital. McGuire and Schrijvers (2003), 
using the factorial decomposition methodology, find that a single common factor explains about 80% of 
the common variance of the country risk premium for a basket of 15 countries7.  Moreover, these authors 
observed a negative correlation of the common primary factor with interest rates indicators in the US and 
positive  correlation  with  global markets  volatility indicator.  Accordingly,  the  co-movements  of  the 
sovereign risk series are linked to the global financial cycles, as in the pull-push debate. In the same way, 
Longstaff et  al. (2011) conduct  a  principal  component  analysis  and  find  that  the  first  three  principal 
components  account  for  more  than  50%  of  the  common  variance  of  the  Credit  Default  Swap (CDS) 
series for a group of 26 countries. After this exercise, the authors run regressions of the monthly variations 
of the CDS series against local factors and external indicators. The average result is that the local factors 
chosen  (local  stock  exchange  volatility,  official  reserve  variance,  and  nominal  exchange  rate  variation) 
explain,  on  average,  one-third  of  the  CDS  variation. The  remainder  would  be  explained mainly by 
indicators of return on the US stock market and return of US Treasury bonds. 

The  existing  empirical  evidence  on  co-movements  of  sovereign  risk  series  for developing countries 
supports  the  intuition  behind  our  Figure  1  in  the  introduction.  More  specifically,  we  examine  a  set  of 
developing economies between 1999 and 2019 and try study to what extent common (push) factors explain 
the variation in country-risk. Therefore, we will analyze the co-movements of the sovereign risk series of 
the economies that are part of the JP Morgan’s EMBI+. Before our empirical exercise, we briefly explain 
the country-risk indicators that we use in this paper. 

 

 

2.2.  EMBI + x CDS 

The Emerging  Market  Bond  Index (EMBI+)  is  one  of  the  most  widespread  country  risk  indicators  and 
began  to  be  calculated  in  1993  by  JP  Morgan  Chase. The  index  reflects  the  weighted  average  of  the 
difference between the daily returns of sovereign debt instruments of emerging countries and the difference 
in yield of US Treasury securities of the same maturity. Originally, the index consisted of three types of 
debt  instruments  from  emerging  countries: Bradies,  Eurobonds  and  external  loans  from sovereign 
entities. The weight of each is given by the fractions of its emission on the total issued. On March 31, 2016, 
the EMBI+ included 155 instruments from 16 emerging countries with a face value of US $ 309.2 billion 
and  a  market  value  of  US  $  325.4  billion. JP  Morgan  Chase  still  makes  the  EMBI+  index  available 
separately 
is  called 
EMBI+br. Its spread is  known  as  Brazil’s  country-risk  and  corresponds  to  the  weighted  average  of  the 
premiums paid by Brazilian foreign debt in relation to US Treasury of the same maturities.

6 Our focus is to investigate country-risk determinants derived from market indices, which seek to reflect the risk priced perceived 
by  sovereign  bond  investors.  We  discard  in  this  work  the  analysis  of  risk  ratings  classified  by  rating  agencies  for  two  main 
reasons:  (i)  these  agencies  have  commercial  strategies  that  often  do  not  translate  the  truly  perceived  market  risk;  (ii)  these 
strategies also tend, in a longer run, to pursue market priced country risk, with no relevant difference between risk ratings and 
country risk indices.  
7 The authors use EMBI Global as an indicator of the country risk premium. We will discuss these indicators later.

Typically, another widely used country risk indicator is the Credit Default Swap (CDS). The CDS is a credit 
derivative  and  has,  in  theory,  the  function  of  protecting  its  buyer  in  relation  to  the default risk of 
securities. In fact, the CDS is the main instrument in the credit derivative market, accounting for 89.3% of 
the credit derivatives transacted in the North American market8. The spread of the CDS corresponds to the 
premium  paid  for  the  derivative  of  the  buyer  and  its swap occurs  only  in a situation  of  "credit  events": 
bankruptcy,  prepayment  obligations,  missed  payments,  default  and  restructuring (Farhi,  2009). This 
premium 
risk  premium  because,  by  arbitrage, 
the insured's premium is  directly  correlated  with  the  implicit  risk  in  the  differential  of  the  remuneration 
between the sovereign debt and Treasury bills. Thus, it is expected by arbitrage that the trends of the EMBI+ 
and CDS series will converge. 

is  ultimately  equivalent

to 

Farhi  (2009) argues that in  the last  years of the  first  decade of 2000, the country  risk, measured  by the 
EMBI+, had begun to lose its significance as an indicator of risk, due to two factors: (i) lower liquidity in 
the secondary markets and (ii) stronger volatility of US Treasury bills. CDS, on the other hand, had a strong 
growth  in  its  trade  rate  in  the  same  period,  becoming  an  important  indicator  of  the  investors’  risk 
perception. Farhi  (Ibid.)  points out  that the greater liquidity of the CDS  would justify its greater  use by 
market analysts since its spread would better reflect the perception of country risk by investors. 

However,  the  perception  that  the  CDS reflects  better  the  perception  of  risk  than  the  EMBI+ may not 
be true. Since  the  CDS  correspond  to  the  purchases  and  sale  of default insurance in  exchange  for  the 
payment  of  a  premium,  this  market  can  grow  unconnected  with  the  growth  of  the  stock  of  bonds 
negotiated. In the Brazilian case, for instance, there was a negative net variation of the securities available 
abroad in the  years 2000 (stock of the federal external public debt fell from US$ 166 billion in January 
2016 to US$ 148 billion in December 2018).  CDS’s faster reaction dynamic would be due to its greater 
liquidity despite the stagnation of issued sovereign bonds. However, the greater liquidity makes it possible 
for the CDS buyer to earn profits even without the occurrence of  a "credit event" since the CDS can be 
resold if there is an increase in its price (which translates into a CDS rise for a specific country). Therefore, 
investors can earn profits if they choose a short position whenever the CDS of a given country starts to rise. 
In this example, as it becomes clear the profitability of the short position, investors may buy more CDS and 
contribute to its increase.  This very speculative movement can cause the elevation of the CDS of this given 
country. It is not difficult to conclude that this dynamic makes the CDS a highly speculative derivative. 

Despite  the  greater  liquidity  of  the  CDS,  in  this work  we  consider  the  EMBI+  as  the  main  indicator  of 
sovereign risk. First, because both have a very similar trend. It is worth noting that the CDS is consistently 
below the EMBI+ level during the last decade (Figure 2). This is explained by the fact that this instrument 
is normally linked to shorter maturities operations than EMBI+ (Central Bank of Brazil 2007). Second, as 
we have argued, the CDS can respond to strong speculative movements that do not reflect variations in the 
external fragility position of a country. Third, the EMBI+ has a longer track record than the CDS, as well 
as being made available to a larger number of countries. 

In our empirical study, we consider the EMBI+ country risk series for the following countries: Argentina, 
Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, Egypt,  Ecuador, Philippines, Malaysia, Mexico,  Panama,  Peru,  Russia, 
Venezuela,  Ukraine, and  Turkey9. The  older  series  available  begin  in  January  1998,  but  some  countries 
have series starting later, as in the case of Malaysia, which has data only from July 2010 on. All series end 
in January 2019.

2.3. Principal component analysis results 

The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) goal is to summarize the information present in numerous time 
series in fewer time series that will contain the essential information of this original set of series (Jolliffe, 
2002). It models the variance and covariance structure of a set of time series from linear combinations of 
the  original  series  (their  principal  components). The  principal  components  are  then  generated  from  the 
variance-covariance  matrix  derived  from  the  series  of  original  random  variables,  without  requiring  any

The smaller number of components able to 
explain the greater variability of the original set of time series is interpreted as common factors that explain 
the variation of these series.  
In  this  paper,  we  will  follow  this  interpretation  to  infer the  degree  of  relevance  of  common  factors in 
explaining the country risk premium variables of different developing countries.  These common factors 
are usually linked to factors external to these countries in the push literature (Calvo et al., 1993). According 
to Johnson and Wichern (2002), the scalars associated with each time series in the eigenvalues obtained in 
the  analysis  are  very  similar  in  numerical  terms  to  the  correlation  of  the  original  series  with  the  main 
component.  It  is  also  possible  to  address  the  correlation  of  the  main  components  with  exogenous 
variables. For example, it is  possible to  evaluate the correlation between  one or more main components 
obtained with an indicator such as the VIX (Volatility Index), which measures the volatility of stock options 
in the S&P 500. 

As noted in Figure 03, the trajectories of the country risk premium curves have in common a sharp decline 
after 2004 and to rise in the years of the subprime financial crisis. The matrix of simple correlations among 
the country risk series reinforces the suspicion that there are common generating factors in these series. It 
is  worth  mentioning  that  Table  1  does  not  include  Bulgaria,  whose  series  ended  in  March  2014,  and 
Malaysia, whose series began only in July 2010.

Simple correlation is greater than 0.50 in most cases. Negative correlations are observed, especially in the 
cases of the series of Egypt and Venezuela. In the case of the former, this is due to an abrupt rise of country 
risk during the Arab Spring, in which the central power was forcibly overthrown, and a new government 
was reestablished. This increase in country risk in 2010 was not accompanied by other countries. In the 
case of Venezuela, the country risk has raised since 2017, due to the current political crisis and recurrent 
coup threatens over these years. Again, this movement was not accompanied by other countries. It is worth 
mentioning, therefore, that situations of extreme political crisis, which  threatens the current  authority of 
central  power,  is,  in  fact,  an  idiosyncratic  factor  that  affects  the  country  risk  premium  of  an  economy 
without necessarily being linked to an external factor. 

When dealing with common factors there is also a possibility of contagion. Extreme situations associated 
with  insolvency  in  foreign  currency,  as  was  the  case  of  Argentina  in  2001,  can  be  transmitted  to  the 
premium country risk of other countries. There was a direct contagion, as can be seen in the curves of 
Latin  American  countries  that  seem  to  be  affected  by  the  Argentine  shock,  as  well  as  by  an  indirect 
contagion mediated by the deterioration in the perception of global risk, which would be damage the risk 
premiums of countries such as the Philippines and Turkey. 

In addition to correlation, the principal component analysis indicates that it is possible to explain the EMBI+ 
series  of  developing  economies  with  a  few  common  factors.  We  present  four  different  groupings  of 
countries  in  order  to  verify  if  the  results  of  the  principal  component  analysis  were  robust.  Moreover, 
although we have chosen to carry out the present analysis from the EMBI+ series, as explained previously, 
we apply the principal component analysis also to two groupings of countries from their CDS. The results 
are summarized in Figure 04, which shows the cumulative proportion of the global variance explained by 
the first and second major components.

explained by the first component. Jolliffe (2002) points out that this percentage would be enough to choose 
only one principal component to summarize the original set of series. When aggregating the second major 
component, the explained percentage jumps to 91% in one of the clusters. This indicates, as we shall see, 
that consideration of the two main components will suffice for economic interpretation. It is worth noting 
that results are maintained when the CDS is considered as a country risk indicator. The results found here 
confirm  others  works with  the same methodology  (Longstaff  et  al.,  2011) and are in  line  with  the push 
literature on capital flows. Annex I to this Article contains the individual and cumulative proportions of all 
the major components for each grouping.

In Group 1, the emerging economies that currently make up the EMBI + index were included, excluding 
Bulgaria, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria and Poland due to the unavailability of data in the period considered. 
In addition, we excluded Egypt and Venezuela due to an extreme political crisis, as already mentioned. In 
Group 1.1 we removed Ukraine from the sample, allowing the analysis to begin in July 1999 and capture, 
for example, the Argentine crisis of 2001. Group 1 comprises 10 countries with very different realities such 
as Russia and Philippines, and the principal component analysis indicates that 86% of the original variance 
of the risk premium can be explained by two main components (71% is explained by only the first principal 
component).  In  Group  2,  only  Latin  American  economies  were  selected,  while  Group  2.1  excluded 
Venezuela  to  control  how  this  country  could  change  the  outcome.  The  intent  of  applying  the  main 
component analysis only in Latin American economies was to check whether the common factors become 
more relevant to a subset of economies that may be more subject to the contagion effect. The result indicates 
that there is slightly greater relevance of the first two main components in explaining the original variances 
of the series. 

So  far,  we  showed  the  relevance  of  the  first  and  second  principal  components  in  explaining  the  total 
variance of the original series, which is a strong evidence of common factors determining the country-risk 
premium. In the next section, we will evaluate in more detail the economic interpretation of these results. 

3. An economic interpretation of the main component analysis results: international liquidity in the 
years 2000 and its developments for analyzed developing economies 

3.1. The international liquidity expansion the 2000s 

Medeiros (2008) claims that the reintegration of Latin America countries to the financial markets in the late 
1980s and early 1990s preceded an era of financial instabilities associated with commodity prices cycles. 
Crises arising from disruptions to the financial flow were frequent in the 1990s and particularly affected

showed that the country-risk premium, which is an important constraint to domestic interest rate in terms 
of external  financing, is  largely determined by  common factors among developing economies. Now we 
explore the link among the common factors and the international liquidity cycles.   

According to Freitas et al. (2016) and Akyüz (2017), in the 1990s, the greater integration of the developing 
world  led to  a synchronization of cycles and,  from  the 2000s, this integration, together  with  changes in 
economic policies of a large number of developing countries,  also contributed to a decoupling of the growth 
trend of the developing economies relative to the advanced countries. This movement would be strongly 
linked to the change in the external financing pattern of developing economies, expressed both by the large 
inflow  of  foreign  capital  to  these  countries  and  by  the  new  trend  of  a  substantial  accumulation  of 
international reserves.

Accoding to   Serrano  (2013) and  Freitas et  al.  (2016), four  factors help  to  explain the  changing  pattern 
observed  in  developing  economies  since  the  2000s:  (i)  the  maintenance  of  low  interest  rates  in  central 
countries; (ii) the large flow of capital to peripheral countries; (iii) the increase in the relative prices of the 
main mineral and agricultural commodity; and (iv) the rapid expansion of the domestic market and imports 
of  the  Chinese  and  other  large  developing  economies  in  the  period.  Factors  (i)  and  (ii)  are  strongly 
associated to the expansion of international liquidity in the search for higher yields. Thus, in addition to the 
low-interest  rates,  there  is  a  general  movement  of  improved  risk  perception  of  developing  economies 
(Frenkel and Rapetti, 2011). 

This new pattern of external financing to developing economies is reflected in Figure 05. As Frenkel and 
Rappetti (2011) point out, the Latin American economies taken together presented a surplus in the current 
account between 2003 and 2007. After that, deficits have returned to the negative field, but the inflow of 
capital by the financial account more than compensated the deficit in current transactions. Serrano (2013) 
adds  that  many  developing  countries  took  advantage  of  this  window  of  opportunity  and  improved  the 
management  of  their  balance  of  payments  (and  particular  their  financial  accounts),  something  that  
contributed to this new and more positive external financing scenario. Many of these economies achieved 
to pay its official foreign debt stock, accumulated international reserves (Figure 05) and some established 
(or  increased  the  assets  in)  Sovereign  Funds.  Central  Banks  also  adopted  a  "dirty"  managed  floating 
exchange rate regime, in other to mitigate speculative attacks. These measures made developing countries 
more resilient to international shocks and allowed  growth not be interrupted by the Balance of Payments 
constrain. This also led to a tendency to appreciate the exchange rate, with the exception of some Asian 
countries, in the period from 2004 until the 2008 international crisis, with a resumption of this movement 
in 2010. The general exchange appreciation movement of commodity exports, in its turn, contributed to the 
upward trend of commodity prices, exported by developing countries. Eichengreen (2016) identifies a sharp 
fall in the number of episodes of exchange rate crisis from 2003 onwards (Figure 06).

3.2. Structural breaks for the country-risk premium 

This changing pattern in global liquidity translated into a fall of the country-risk premium (EMBI+) from 
an average of 864 from 1998 to 2002 to a level of around 350 in 2003 onwards. In the case of Brazil, which 
motivated our present work, the same movement occurred simultaneously at the EMBI Brazil and the CDS 
Brazil, from 2004 on (figure 07).

This structural change was captured by Bai and Perron (2003) structural break tests, in its different versions, 
as shown in Table 2. Additionally, it was performed two unit roots with structural breakpoints tests11. These 
tests are not consensual about the existence of the unit root in this series, but this was not the purpose of

The interest is only to corroborate the results of the test Bai Perron, showing that possible 
break dates match those found by Bai-Perron test. 

Tests indicate then an important change in the behavior from the second half of 2002, both for the specific 
series to Brazil and for the EMBI+, the year from which the risk had a significant drop and 2004/2005 as 
the year from which the settles down to a lower level. In the case of the CDS, whose series started in 2002, 
tests  indicated  a  break  in  2004,  a  year  from  which  the  series  was  significantly  lower  (Figure  07).  Our 
empirical  results  reinforce  both  our  central  argument  about  external  factors  determining  country-risk 
premium  and  the  impact  of  international  liquidity  expansion  in  the  2000s  on  the  external  financing  of 
developing countries. In other words, the liquidity expansion in advanced economies increased the capital 
flows to the periphery, and the combined effect of faster growth in South-South trade, better terms of trade  
and the massive accumulation of foreign reserves in a large number of developing countries contributed to 
a fall in the country-risk premium spreads.

3.3. Country risk-premium and the international liquidity variables 

Following Calvo et al.(1993), we show the correlation among the first principal component – which we 
interpret as “common factors” to developing economies – and three key variables for determining the global 
financial cycle (in particular for developing economies): the interest rate corresponding to the Federal Fund 
Rate (FFR) and the interest rate corresponding to the 5-year Treasury Notes as an indicator of international 
reference interest rates, the Brent oil barrel price as a commodity price indicator and the VIX index as an 
indicator of risk perception.

Table 03 presents the simple correlation analysis for the first principal component generated by Group 1.1 
with each one of the above economic indicator of the global financial cycle. Due to the lack of consensus 
of unit root tests, and the possibility of structural breaks, we also tested the hypothesis of cointegration by 
using Lütkepohl et al. (2003) procedure. The test indicates that these four variables cointegrate as a group. 
Additionally, the test for the first component and each of one of three variables indicates the rejection of 
the null hypothesis  of no cointegration  (annex).   We then  estimate a cointegrated  regression, supposing

The  empirical  exercise  suggests  then  that  an  increase  in  the  international  interest  rate  coincides  with  a 
greater common perception of risk, as well as the increase in the VIX volatility index. It is worth mentioning 
that the correlation is higher with the 5 years rate and the volatility indicator. A possible explanation for 
this relationship is the fact that these variables carry implicitly the perception of market agents about the 
possible future trajectory of the US basic rate. The main principal factor is also negatively correlated with 
the oil price, which is expected, given the large weight of primary goods in exports. 

The series representing the two main components of Group 1.1. of our study (composed of 10 emerging 
economies)  are  represented  in  Figure  0812.  The  numerical  calculation  for  obtaining  the  principal 
components  alone  is  devoid  of  economic  significance  since  they  represent  only  the  common  factors  to 
different time series. However, as the first principal component curve suggests, this major component of 
the country-risk series coincides with the change in the pattern of external financing observed from 2004 
onwards. This may explain, even, its correlations with interest variables, market volatility, and commodity 
prices expressed in Table 02 and Equation (1). Put in another way, the first principal component replicates 
the changes in the global liquidity scenario.

The curve of the first major component also highlights two particular moments that reflect a deterioration 
in the perception of risk in the emerging economies. The first one refers to the 2008 international financial 
crisis and, in this case, the curve quickly returns to the previous level. The second one was also a large rise 
in the risk level in 10 emerging economies in 201413. Akyüz (2017) shows that this period was characterized 

                                                           
12  The  main  components  are  generated  from  the  normalized  eigenvalues.  For  a  more  detailed  discussion,  see  Johnson  and 
Wichern (2002). 
13 It is worth noting that the second principal component presented in Figure 08 is also relevant, accounting alone for explaining 
about 15% of the total variance of 10 original series of country risk. This component seems to reproduce the effect of Argentina's 
external debt default on the perception of country risk of the emerging countries in 2001 and 2002. This effect would last until 
2005, suggesting a memory of default episodes on the trajectory of country risk. The second principal component also seems to 
counterbalance the more general rise observed in the risk premium at the time of the international financial crisis in 2008. This

Turkey. The flow of capital to Latin American countries and their reserves also ceased to grow, although 
there is no loss of reserves. The author addresses this inflection in the path of the risk to the perception of 
a  crisis  in  the  Euro  Zone  and,  back  in  2013,  with  the  signaling  by  the  Fed  that  the  cycle  of  liquidity 
expansion could be coming to an end. These two factors are highlighted by Figure 09, which points to the 
increase in the VIX volatility index at the end of 2014 and the US future interest rate (T-Note of 5 years) 
in May 201314. 

Therefore, the rise in country-risk premium during the years of 2013-2015 was largely due to a reversal in 
the  international  liquidity  despite  domestic  economic  or  political  facts.  In  this  regard,  Naqvi  (2018) 
conducted  41  interviews  with  participants  of  the  sovereign  bond  markets  in  Hong  Kong  and  Singapore 
between January and April 2013, in parallel with a detailed analysis of the specialized media in the period. 
His conclusion is that the perception of risk of market players on the domestic fundamentals of the emerging 
economies is strongly influenced by international liquidity conditions. According to the author: 

“Relying on extensive interviews with market participants and examination of the financial press, this paper 
argues that not only was the post-global financial crisis (GFC) investment boom into EM sovereign bonds 
driven by push factors, including some not  emphasized  in existing  literature such as crisis  in  unrelated 
markets  that  offered  a  similar  risk/return  profile,  but  also  that  investors’  perceptions  of  domestic 
fundamentals (the pull factors) were themselves influenced by these push factors, and so became divorced 
from reality. In addition to the macro-level push factors themselves, the micro-foundations of investors’ 
decision making, including investors’ reliance on heuristics and shortcuts, the ways in which investors used 
market  data  to  predict  market  reactions  to  changes  in  the  push  and  pull  factors,  and  the  investment 
mandates  and  business  models  of  institutional  investors,  made  investors  even  more  susceptible  to  the 
influence of push over pull factors.” (Naqvi, 2018, p. 2). 

The rapid reversal of country risk growth, observed in the first half of 2016 in several developing countries, 
is correlated with the fall in external volatility and 5 years T-Note interest rates (Figure 09). The rise of 
14% in the commodity prices in 2017, after a falling from 2012 to 2016 (40% drop in metal and agricultural 
commodities measured by the IMF), also help to explain the improvement in external conditions.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                           
is because some countries, notably Argentina and Brazil, experienced a relatively small increase in their country-risk premium 
in this period. 
14  It  is  worth  noting  that  despite  the  threat  of  a  tightening  of  monetary  policy  by  the  FED,  which  automatically  triggered  an 
escalation of future interest rates, it only actually occurred in 2016. Since the emerging risk perception seems more correlated to 
future interest than to basic interest, this effect had already been felt in 2013/14 by emerging economies.

4. Final Remarks 

The  present  paper  sought  to  investigate  the  role  of  financial  integration  of  developing  economies  to 
international markets in  the variability of the country risk variable. We recalled the pull-push debate on 
determinants of capital inflows in order to contextualize our empirical analysis. Our Principal Component 
Analysis of the country-risk spread series of ten emerging economies from 1999 to 2019 revealed that 86% 
of  the  total  volatility  of  the  original  series  can  be  represented  by  only  two  components,  suggesting  the 
prevalence of common factors in determining country risk. This evidence, reinforced by the correlation of 
the first major component with global liquidity indicators, corroborates our hypothesis that the sovereign 
risk trend is driven by external factors, in line with the push literature. 

Our contribution is to strengthen the thesis, expressed in Medeiros (2008), about the subordination of cycles 
in developing economies to global financial cycles. This in effect imposes an (asymmetric) constraint for 
the management of domestic monetary policy. To avoid capital outflows and/or successive exchange rate 
devaluations, the domestic interest rate should not remain lower  than the international reference interest 
rate added to its risk premium (Serrano and Summa, 2015). This constraint, as we have seen, has changed 
significantly in the 2000s.  In the recent expansionary cycle of global liquidity, many developing economies 
seems to have taken advantage of this window of opportunity to simultaneously grow more and reduce their 
external  vulnerability.  These  two  movements  ended  up  having  the  combined  effect  of  lowering  the 
collective external fragility of the developing economies (Freitas et al., 2016; Serrano, 2013). As a result 
of this change, developing economies experienced a virtually unprecedented period of reduction of Balance 
of payments crises.  

As we have shown above, these favorable developments led to a once for all structural break at the level of 
sovereign risk spreads, that have fallen significantly after 2002. This seems to be the reason why the risk 
has not risen again to the levels prevailing in the 1990s. Although the risk spreads continued to respond to 
international  financial  indicators  and  has  risen  both  during  the  2008/2009  world  financial  crisis,  and  in 
2014/15, when the FED threatened to raise the interest rate and cut the nonconventional monetary policies 
mechanisms, developing economies are in a better position to deal with those changes. This is what we read
