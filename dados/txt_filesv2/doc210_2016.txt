Esse artigo se insere na discussão acerca dos impactos sociais das Zonas Econômicas Especiais ao analisar a 
dinâmica  da  pobreza  e  da  desigualdade  no  Estado  do  Amazonas,  onde  está  localizada  a  Zona  Franca  de 
Manaus  (ZFM).  A  partir  das  técnicas  de  decomposição  e  de  análise  contrafactual,  usando  os  dados  dos 
censos  de  2000  e  2010,  o  presente  artigo  mostra  que  a  renda  do  trabalho  foi  o  principal  responsável  pela 
redução da pobreza e da desigualdade no município de Manaus na década de 2000-2010. A comparação com 
munícipios  com  características  ex-ante  similares  em  termos  de  critérios  demográficos  e  de  distribuição  de 
renda  corrobora  com  a  hipótese  de  que  há  em  Manaus  um  relativo  sucesso  em  termos  de  redução  de 
pobreza,  tendo  a  renda  do  trabalho  contribuído  de  forma  importante  para  tal  redução.  Já  no  restante  do 
estado do Amazonas, foram as rendas não provenientes do trabalho que desempenharam contribuíram para  
a evolução dos indicadores de pobreza e desigualdade. A evolução contrastada dessas variáveis sugere que a 
ZFM exerceu impacto positivo, ainda que com limitações, sobre a região de Manaus.

Abstract 

 

This  study  contributes  to  the  literature  on  the  social  impacts  of  Special  Economic  Zones  by  analyzing  the 
dynamics  of  poverty  and  inequality  in  the  Brazilian  state  of  Amazonas,  where  the  Free  Trade  Zone  of 
Manaus  (FTZM)  is  located.  Using  census  data,  statistical  micro-decompositions  and  counterfactual 
simulations,  we  show  that  labor  income  was  a  major  driver  of  poverty  and  inequality  declines  for  the 
municipality  of  Manaus  in  the  2000-2010  decade.  Comparison  with  ex-ante  ‘similar’  municipalities,  in 
terms  of  distributional  and  demographic  criteria,  corroborates  a  relative  success  in  terms  of  poverty 
reduction in Manaus as well as the essential role played by labor income. Non-labor income was far more 
important in the rest of the state of Amazonas. These contrasting results help illustrate both the benefits and 
limitations of the influence of the FTZM.

POVERTY AND INEQUALITY DYNAMICS IN MANAUS: LEGACY OF A FREE 

TRADE ZONE? 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Special economic zones (SEZs) can be broadly defined as “demarcated geographic areas contained within a 
country’s national boundaries where the rules of business are different from those that prevail in the national 
territory”  (see  Farole  and  Akinci,  2011).  The  creation  of  these  zones  inside  a  country’s  borders  has  been 
used  in  past  decades  as  a  policy  instrument  to  generate  employment,  promote  industrialization,  enhance 
regional integration and, ultimately, as a tool to foster economic development and raise peoples’ standards 
of living. The number of SEZs has indeed surged in the world, particularly in developing countries, and a 
wide range of them can now be found with different goals and distinct strategies.1  

Despite this widespread use of SEZs in developing countries, their economic and social record has remained 
controversial.  Although  SEZs  can  drive  up  job  creations  and  technology  transfers,  attract  foreign  direct 
investment  and  multinational  companies,  strengthen  integration  into  global  value  chains  and  create 
backward  and  forward  linkages  with  the  rest  of  the  economy,  they  can  also  create  distortions  (tax-based, 
geographical,  etc.)  and  their  impact  on  labor  standards  and  human  development  is  still  a  subject  of 
considerable  debate.  Recent  reviews  of  descriptive  case  studies  point  out  how  gains  from  zone  operations 
vary across countries, but also within countries and across zones and time (see Aggarwal, 2007, 2012; FIAS 
2008; Farole, 2011, Sargent and Matthews, 2004). 

One  area  in  which  evidence  is  still  scarce  (partly  due  to  data  availability  problems  and  measurement 
difficulties) has to do with the potential poverty-alleviating effect of SEZs in developing countries.2 Some 
recent  studies  find how SEZs  might offer better job  opportunities, particularly for more vulnerable groups 
(women, young people, minorities and poor people in general), which may include higher wages (Amengual 
and Milberg, 2008;  McCallum, 2011) and better  labor  conditions (Jenkins, 2005;  Cling  et al., 2005;  Glick 
and  Roubaud,  2006;  Cling  et  al.,  2009;  Aggarwal,  2007;  Amengual  and  Milberg,  2008;  De  Hoyos  et  al., 
2012). These factors may lead to poverty and/or inequality reduction. At the same time, several case studies 
(Oberai et al., 2001; Kwaku Akpokavie, 2001; ILO, 2003 and 2008; Glick and Roubaud, 2006; McCallum, 
2011) also find some troubling signals associated with the development of SEZs, such as lax enforcement of 
labor  laws  (unrestrictive  firing  regulations  and  a  lack  of  social  protection),  lower  labor  standards  (with 
respect  to  social  dialogue,  freedom  of  association,  collective  bargaining,  etc.),  high  turnover  due  to 
“sweatshop”  working  conditions  in  factories  (working  hours,  pace  of  work,  health  and  safety),  and 
persistently low wage levels over time. However, almost none of the abovementioned studies focus on the 
ultimate effects of SEZs on household poverty and inequality and indeed few are based on individual data 
(average  sector  data  or  aggregate  firm-level  data  are  more  frequently  used).  Among  the  exceptions,  Glick 
and  Roubaud  (2006)  and  Cling  et  al.  (2005,  2009),  for  Madagascar,  do  focus  on  workers’  earnings  using 
individual-level labor force surveys in the Malagasy capital (Antananarivo), and De Hoyos et al.(2012), for 
Honduras, is one of the rare studies to look at the effects of SEZs on total household income poverty.  For 
example, Cling et al. (2005) find that, in the 1995-2001 period, firms in the Malagasy Zone Franche offered 
wages as high as the formal private sector ones, while employees’ working conditions were in general more 
generous  (with  the  exception  of  working  hours).  The  econometric  study  of  De  Hoyos  et  al.  (2012)  also 
shows for Honduras that workers in the maquila sector earned higher wages between 1991 and 2006 and the 
authors  evaluate,  through  a  partial  equilibrium  simulation  exercise,  that  poverty  would  have  been  higher 
without the maquila sector.  

Depending on the set of characteristics and the environment of each SEZ, the consequences for poverty and 
inequality at a local or regional level can be very different.3 For example, the type of activities promoted and 

                                                 
1 The denomination ‘SEZ’ covers a broad range of more specific zone types such as Free Trade Zones (FTZ), Export Processing Zones (EPZ), 
Enterprise  Zones,  Free  Ports  and  others.  See  Farole  (2011),  Farole  and  Akinci  (2011),  and  Siroën  and  Yücer  (2014)  for  descriptions  and 
classifications of different types of SEZs in the world.  
2 However the link between trade liberalization and poverty has been the subject of extensive research (for a recent literature review, see Winters 
and Martuscelli, 2014)

their links with the local economy matter. Consequently, the role of SEZs in poverty alleviation and, more 
generally, in income distribution changes still calls for clarification and an in-depth analysis of each specific 
case,  and  in  the  end,  remains  an  empirical  issue.  Our  aim  is  to  contribute  to  the  literature  by  analyzing 
poverty  and  inequality  changes  in  the  Free  Trade  Zone  of  Manaus  (FTZM)  and,  more  generally,  in  the 
Brazilian state of Amazonas in the past decade.  

The FTZM in Brazil is an interesting case study to analyze the impact of SEZs on distributional outcomes. 
First,  the  creation  of  the  FTZM,  in  the  center  of  the  Amazon  Forest,  was  designed  from  the  outset  to 
contribute  to  the  economic  and  social  development  of  the  Amazon  Region,  one  of  the  poorest  regions  in 
Brazil4, and to step up its political integration into the rest of the country. The municipality of Manaus is an 
isolated enclave where the only means of transportation are the Amazon River and airplane. Despite these 
problems with transport and market access (local, regional, domestic and foreign), the creation of the FTZM 
prompted  the  development  of  an  important  industrial  hub  in  Manaus  that  has  posted  particularly  good 
economic  outcomes  over  the  last  decade.  By  way  of  illustration,  between  2000  and  2010,  gross  domestic 
product in Manaus posted high levels of growth (4.4% on an annual average basis),  resulting in major job 
creations.5  As  of  2010,  the  manufacturing  sector  represented  a  higher  share  of  employment  in  the 
municipality  of  Manaus  than  the  average  for  Brazil  as  a  whole  and  even  for  Brazil’s  urban  areas  only.6 
Defenders  of  the  FTZM  argue  that  this  economic  boom  generated  economic  gains  as  well  as  positive 
environmental  and  social  effects.  However,  if  the  FTZM’s  good  economic  performance  can  be  related  to 
particularly relevant improvements in poverty and inequality indicators in the municipality of Manaus, and 
more widely in the poor state of Amazonas, still needs to be documented.  

This  study  uses  two  statistical  micro-decomposition  methods  to  identify  and  quantify  the  relevant  factors 
that account for observed changes in income poverty and inequality from 2000 to 2010 in the municipality 
of  Manaus,  where  the  Free  Trade  Zone  is  established,  and  in  the  rest  of  the  Amazonas  state.  Based  on  a 
series  of  counterfactual  simulations,  this  approach  has  been  recently  employed  in  the  analysis  and 
comparison of poverty and inequality dynamics in developing and emerging countries, in particular in Latin 
American  countries  (Azevedo  et  al.  2013b;  Inchauste  et  al.  2014).  The  first  methodology  is  a  Shapley-
Shorrocks  estimate  of  the  standard  Datt-Ravallion  (1992)  decomposition  method,  which  sets  out  to  assess 
the  intricate  relationship  between  poverty,  economic  growth  and  inequality  by  breaking  down  changes  in 
poverty  into  the  two  main  poverty  reduction  mechanisms:  growth  and  redistribution  components.  Our 
second  decomposition  method  seeks  to  gauge  which  income  sources  and  household  characteristics  make 
large contributions to  changes in  poverty  and/or  inequality. We  use  the Azevedo et al. (2012a and 2012b) 
recently  developed  Shapley-value  decomposition,  which  builds  on  the  Barros  et  al.  (2006)  method,  to 
quantify contributions to distributional changes due to changes in demographics, employment, labor income 
and  non-labor  income.  Though  these  decomposition  methods  are an  accounting  exercise  and  do  not  prove 
causality,  understanding  the  relative  importance  of  the  proximate  determinants  considered  in  our  analysis 
can inform discussions on the potential particularities of Manaus within the region and the country as well as 
the  role  that  different  types  of  public  policies  may  have  effectively  played  in  the  area’s  poverty  and 
inequality dynamics. These accounting  methods are thus applied separately to  the municipality  of Manaus 
and  the  rest  of  the  state  of  Amazonas  (also  to  total  and  urban  Brazil  census  samples  to  offer  a  country 
perspective).  In  an  effort  to  provide  a  framework  of  comparison,  we  have  also  implemented  our 
decomposition methods for the rest of Brazilian municipalities, keeping those with similar initial conditions 
(in  terms  of  income  distribution  and  demographic  characteristics).  As  we  discuss  later  in  the  paper,  the 
municipality of Manaus, where the FTZM is located, is a rather unique case in Brazil, which does not allow 
the implementation of standard impact evaluation methods (such as experimental, cost-benefit or synthetic 

                                                 
4According  to  the  Institute  of  Applied  Economic  Research  Poverty  Series  (see  www.ipeadata.gov.br),  high  levels  of  poverty  are  historically 
encountered mostly in the Northeast and North. Taking their longest time series available (which uses a poverty line based on an estimation of 
basic needs in terms of calorie intake), the proportion of poor in 1976 was estimated as 62% in the Northeast and 42% in the North (with values 
ranging from 32% to 20% in the other regions). In 2011, poverty numbers fell, but rankings across the regions remained almost the same: 28% in 
the Northeast, 25% in the North and around 7% elsewhere (IPEA, 2015). 
5 GDP growth in the municipality of Manaus, and even that observed at the level of the state of Amazonas (5.3%), was higher on average than 
the growth observed in Brazil (3.6%) in the 2000-2010 decade.

control methods) to quantitatively evaluate the effects of the FTZM. However, our decomposition analysis 
sheds  light  on  the  extent  of  the  FTZM’s  influence  on  household  income  distribution  and  its  potential 
spillover effects on the rest of the state of Amazonas and, therefore, contributes to a better understanding of 
the effects of such trade and industrial policies on poverty in underprivileged areas. 

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the FTZM regime, its characteristics and 
its  economic  performance  in  the  last  decade.  Section  3  describes  the  data,  samples  and  variables  used 
(subsection  3.1)  and  provides  some  summary  statistics  (subsection  3.2).  Section  4  presents  our  two 
decomposition  methods  and  Section  5  summarizes  the  distributional  decomposition  results  as  follows: 
Subsection 5.1 presents decomposition results for the growth and redistribution components; Subsection 5.2 
presents decomposition results for the demographics and income components; and Subsection 5.3 explores 
comparability  of  results  by  looking  at  the  situation  of  the  municipality  of  Manaus  with  its  FTZM,  among 
Brazilian municipalities presenting ex-ante similar characteristics. Lastly, Section 6 concludes. 

2. THE FREE TRADE ZONE OF MANAUS (FTZM) 

The  Free  Trade  Zone  of  Manaus  (FTZM)  was  established  in  1967,  although  the  issue  of  the  Amazon 
Region’s  economic  development  and  political  integration  had  been  on  Brazil’s  official  agenda  for  a  long 
time. Following the collapse of the rubber-based economy in the early twentieth century, many government 
measures were adopted to create incentives and enhance the region’s development, suffering as it was from 
a lack of economic buoyancy, poverty and geostrategic handicaps.  

Decree-Law No. 288 of February 1967 created “an area of free trade of imports and exports and special tax 
incentives,  established  with  the  purpose  of  creating  an  industrial,  commercial,  agricultural  and  livestock 
center”  in  the  Amazon  region,  with  a  government  agency  -  the  Superintendent  of  the  Manaus  Free  Trade 
Zone  (SUFRAMA)  –  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  incentive  schemes.  Since  its  creation,  the 
FTZM has nevertheless undergone a number of economic, legal and institutional changes following changes 
to the government’s development strategy. In the 1970s, for example, the objective of deepening Brazilian 
industrialization (with an import substitution strategy) prompted stricter restrictions on imports in the FTZM 
to encourage the emergence of local industry. The industrial hub gradually flourished as wholesale and retail 
trade  activities  declined.  In  the  1990s,  Brazilian  trade  liberalization  measures  reduced  import  restrictions 
nation-wide,  especially  in  the  FTZM  where  a  system  of  federal  incentives  with  counterparts  was  also 
implemented (firms applying for these benefits had to comply with some minimum requirements in terms of 
tasks,  number  of  jobs  and  investment  in  R&D).7  Since  the  1990s,  only  minor  changes  have  been  made  to 
FTZM policies, such as firms’ contributions to public R&D funds in the Amazon region.  

Consequently, the FTZM is now a “fiscal incentive area” (Garcia, 2009), and its fiscal benefits were recently 
extended through to 2073 by an amendment to the Brazilian Constitution.8 The main incentives granted to 
firms in the industrial hub in the 2000-2010 decade were federal, state and local tax breaks and exemptions.9 
Firms in the FTZM also have the benefit of infrastructure. 

An  important  feature  that  differentiates  the  FTZM  from  many  SEZs  around  the  world  is  the  fact  that  it 
imports many inputs from abroad to sell most of its output to the domestic market. As pointed out by Siroën 
and Yücer (2014), the FTZM is more of an import processing zone than an export processing zone, which is 
the  more  usual  type  of  SEZ.  In  the  2000-2010  decade,  around  50%  of  inputs  were  imported  from  foreign 

                                                 
7 Launched  in  1991, the “Basic  Productive  Process” program (Processo Produtivo  Básico or PPB) grants tax reductions or exemptions for all 
products  (except  arms  and  munitions,  alcoholic  beverages,..  See  art.3º,  Decree-Law  288/1967  for  a  complete  list)  to  companies  that  set  up  a 
manufacturing  process  for  these  products  in  the  FTZM.  The  PPB  scheme  is  used  for  the  FTZM  and  the  special  tax  regime  that  applies  to 
information technology (IT Law, 2001 and 2004).  
8 A first extension of FTZM incentives was granted in 2003 through to 2023, with the second extension in 2014 through to 2073. 
9 The main measures in the system of FTZM fiscal incentives were: (i) 88% reduction of or exemption from import duties on inputs (depending 
on the product’s final destination) and total exemption for capital goods, (ii) a 75% reduction on corporate tax (Imposto de Renda sobre Pessoa 
Jurídica  -  IRPJ),  (iii)  exemption  from  federal  tax  on  industrial  products  (Imposto  sobre  produtos  industriais  -  IPI),  (iv)  exemption  from  or 
reduction of a number of social contributions (such as PIS/PASEP and COFINS, which are employers’ contributions based on sales), (v); a 55% 
to 100% reduction on the state tax on value-added (ICMS – Imposto sobre a Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços, Brazilian VAT) for industrial 
goods, and (vi) exemption from local taxes on real estate (Imposto sobre a Propriedade Territorial Urbana - IPTU). This last exemption applied 
only to firms with more than 500 employees and was phased out in 2008.

markets and more than 90% of sales were made either to other Brazilian states (the majority) or to the rest of 
Amazonas. Consequently, the FTZM’s external trade balance showed an increasing deficit while its internal 
trade balance posted a growing surplus.  

<Figures 1a and 1b> 

The fiscal incentive policies have created a thriving industrial center in Manaus, with a growing share of this 
Amazonian industry in national production.  The Annual Industrial Survey by the Brazilian Census Bureau 
(PIA/IBGE)  reports  that  the  share  of  the  state  of  Amazonas  (the  survey’s  smallest  geographical  unit)  in 
Brazilian  manufacturing  production  reached  3.7%  in  2010  (while  Manaus  accounts  for  just  0.9%  of  the 
Brazilian population).10 After a decade of high growth, Amazonas’ manufacturing production had grown by 
a factor of 3.4, with an annual average growth rate of 13% (see Figure 1a). SUFRAMA data on the firms set 
up in the FTZM present a similar pattern of growth in the FTZM’s sales, also posting average annual growth 
of 13% between 2000 and 2010 (compared with -2% from 1995 to 2000). This economic buoyancy drove a 
huge  wave  of  job  creations  (see  Figure  1b).  In  the  state  of  Amazonas,  manufacturing  employment  almost 
doubled between 2000 and 2010: PIA/IBGE data show that the number of workers in formal manufacturing 
industries  grew  from  59,586  to  116,503  over  the  period  -  a  96%  increase  soaring  above  Brazil’s  average 
50%.  In the FTZM specifically (SUFRAMA  data), the number of employees  rose from 50,005 in  2000 to 
103,673 in 2010 (+107%). In the same time period, the number of firms rose from 307 to 431 (on an annual 
average basis) while the structure of the FTZM industries remained highly concentrated.  

One  explanation  of  the  FTZM’s  dynamism  in  the  2000-2010  period  is  its  production  specialization  in 
durable  goods  for  the  domestic  market.11  Throughout  the  last  decade,  Brazilian  GDP  growth  was  driven 
strongly by rising household consumption and growing investment. The growth in household consumption is 
linked both to an increase in household income (labor earnings along with pensions and social transfers) and 
a boom in consumer credit (IPEA, 2010). Household income growth together with the upturn in credit gave 
low-income families the means to buy durable goods. Motorcycles and electronic devices, the FTZM’s main 
industrial sectors, largely benefited from this increase in domestic demand. Among other factors, Machado 
and Sá (2012) also underline the positive  impact on business expectations of the  stated time extensions of 
the FTZM incentives and some improvements to the fiscal incentive system that stimulated the development 
of the production of intermediate goods in the area.  

The  FTZM’s  costs  and  benefits  are  the  subject  of  long-standing  ongoing  debate  among  Brazilian 
economists. FTZM detractors talk about the cost of the tax incentives and the allegedly poor competitiveness 
of the goods produced in the FTZM. Defenders of the FTZM argue that it generates economic gains as well 
as  positive  social  and  environmental  effects,  because  industrial  activities  add  up  to  less  deforestation  and 
predatory vegetal extraction.12 The success of a SEZ and its effect on the economic development of a region 
also depend on its backward and forward linkages with the rest of the regional economy. On average for the 
2000-2010 decade, 52% of inputs were imported from abroad, 28% produced by “regional firms”13 and 20% 
by companies in the rest of the country.14 Sá (2015) believes that the FTZM’s regional linkages might still 
be  too  weak  considering  policymakers’  expectations  and  should  therefore  be  strengthened.  However,  the 
FTZM does have linkages with local and national suppliers albeit with regional differences.15 

                                                 
10 Almost all the formal manufacturing activities covered by PIA/IBGE in the state of Amazonas are concentrated in the FTZM. 
11 Electronics (basically consumer electronic goods), computers, two-wheelers and beverages are the FTZM’s main sectors. In 2010, the state of 
Amazonas’ computer and electronics industries represented 40.5% of Brazilian gross output (compared with 39.9% for São Paulo). In addition, 
the FTZM became the main producer of two-wheelers in the country in the 2000-2010 period.  
12 For more details on this argument, see Rivas et al (2009). 
13 SUFRAMA publishes statistics on the origin of intermediate goods differentiating between regional, national and foreign markets. Regional 
inputs  are  those  bought  either  in  the  FTZM  itself  or  in  the  other  Amazonian  regions  whose  incentives  are  administered  by  SUFRAMA  (see 
footnote 7 on Brazilian FTZs). 
14 Average sales for the 2000-2010 decade show that 75% of FTZM goods were produced for the domestic market, 18% for the region and only 
7% were exported. 
15  A  total  of  79.3%  of  electronics  inputs  came  from  abroad  in  2010,  while  most  two-wheeler  inputs  were  “regional”  (44.3%  of  inputs  were 
produced in the FTZM or the region, 30.3 % in the rest of the country). Other sectors – like optical products and industries intensive in natural 
resources (paper and metallurgy) – import most of their inputs from the rest of the country.

In  a  move  to  gauge  how  the  FTZM’s  good  economic  performance  in  the  past  decade  may  have  helped 
improve  social  outcomes  in  the  area  and  see  if  wider  regional  effects  are  in  play,  we  present  all  our 
descriptive statistics and decomposition results separately for the municipality of Manaus and the rest of the 
state of Amazonas. Focusing in the municipality of Manaus to capture the FTZM is not without reason. The 
municipality  of  Manaus  represents  during  this  decade  around  80%  of  Amazonas’  GDP  and  the  FTZM  is 
clearly a central economic activity, responsible for the majority of job creation. Both direct and indirect jobs 
have  consequences  on  household  income  distribution,  which  is  our  main  outcome  of  interest  in  order  to 
measure poverty and inequality over total population.  

3. DATA AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS 

3.1. The data 

The  usual  data  source  in  Brazilian  income  poverty  and  inequality  studies  is  the  Pesquisa  National  por 
Amostra  dos  Domicilios  (PNAD),  a  well-known  Brazilian  household  survey  conducted  annually  by  the 
Brazilian  Census  Bureau.  This  survey  has  detailed  data  on  income  and  its  sources  and  now  boasts  both 
national and Federation Unit representativeness. However, two important limitations made it unsuitable for 
our study: (i) its representativeness and coverage do not extend to below state level, and (ii) prior to 2003, 
the sample excluded rural areas in six Federation Units (including the Amazon region, and it was not until 
2004  that  the  PNAD  achieved  total  national  coverage).16  So  in  order  to  focus  on  Manaus  and  remain 
representative at the municipality level, we turned to census data. In this paper, we use the two most recent 
Brazilian  Population  Census  datasets  for  the  years  2000  and  2010.17  Census  data  are  collected  every  ten 
years in Brazil and cover the entire population. A detailed questionnaire (questionario da amostra) including 
household  and  individual  information  on  socio-economic  variables  is  administered  to  a  census  sample  of 
around  11%  of  the  Brazilian  population  in  such  a  way  as  to  maintain  population  representativeness  at  the 
municipality level.18  

The  variable  used  in  this  study  to  compute  poverty  and  inequality  measures  over  the  2000-2010  period  is 
total  monthly household income  per capita, expressed  in  2010 Brazilian Reais  (deflated using  the national 
price  index).  A  major  issue  when  estimating  income  poverty  and  inequality  indicators  is  the  quality  of 
income data, which usually includes measurement errors and outliers, often more prevalent at the two tails 
of the distribution. A common practice is to simply trim a certain number or percentage of observations at 
the  top  and  bottom  of  the  income  distribution.19  In  our  case,  we  decided  to  use  additional  Census 
information  on  households’  non-monetary  welfare  conditions  and  essentially  exclude  from  the  top  and 
bottom  income  quintiles  those  households  that  declared  inconsistent  information  on  asset  holdings. 
Basically, we excluded from our sample those households in the top income quintile that said they had no 
electric lighting or water supply problems (i.e. no municipal supply or water well in the household), a type 
of dwelling other than a house, flat or room (i.e. makeshift, collective, etc.), no toilet in the household, or no 
more than one asset on the following list: refrigerator, washing machine, phone line, computer, television, 
car.  Observations  of  monthly  household  per  capita  income  over  R$  100,000  were  also  excluded  from  the 
sample. From the bottom income quintile, we excluded those households that said they had all the assets in 
the above list and those with a household head declaring more than 14 years of schooling.20 Also, as is usual, 
households  with  missing  information  on  variables  were  dropped  from  this  study.  All  in  all,  data  cleaning 

                                                 
16 The rural areas not covered previously by the PNAD are in the states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia and Roraima. 
17  Our  focus  on  the  2000-2010  decade  is  not  without  reason.  First  of  all,  it  allows  us  to  concentrate  on  a  period  where  the  overall  Brazilian 
extensive  trade  liberalization  reform  had  already  taken  place,  and  economic  and  distributional  indicators  seem  to  have  generally  improved, 
which  permits  to  better  understand  and  isolate  the  relative  effect  of  the  FTZM.  Moreover,  the  definition  of  period  of  activity  for  income 
variables changed in the last two census datasets, and proper comparisons with previous census years is troublesome. 
18 Basically, this detailed questionnaire is put to a sample of 10% of households in municipalities with more than 15,000 inhabitants, and to a 
sample of 20% of households in municipalities with up to 15,000 inhabitants. 
19 For example, Hoffmann and Ney (2008) make inequality comparisons using data from the 2000 Census as well as the PNAD and the National 
Accounts. In their study, they conclude that the proportion of households declaring zero income in the Census is suspiciously larger than in the 
PNAD. They also report some very extreme income values at the very top. They end up trimming all zero incomes as well as observations with 
household incomes over R$ 30,000 in 2000 Brazilian Reais.  
20 We believe that excluding zero incomes from our analysis could misrepresent rural areas in the Amazon region. But as a robustness test, we 
also  computed  all  our  results  eliminating  all  zero  incomes  and  setting  a  lower  top  income  threshold  (R$  50,000  in  2010  Brazilian  Reais),  as 
found in some other studies on Brazil. All our main conclusions remain unchanged.

eliminated  about  10%  of  the  sample.  Yet  since  we  use  Census  data,  our  final  sample  sizes  are  still  very 
large.  For  Manaus,  we  have  some  131,000  observations  (representing  around  1.3  million  individuals)  in 
2000 and around 77,000 observations (representing around 1.6 million individuals) in 2010. For the rest of 
the state of Amazonas, our sample sizes are respectively approximately 150,000 observations (representing 
1.2 million individuals) in 2000 and 192,000 observations (representing 1.5 million individuals) in 2010.21  

Given that we are interested in understanding which factors contribute to changes in poverty and inequality, 
our  decomposition  exercises  differentiate,  among  others,  between  labor  and  non-labor  income  sources. 
Labor income is defined here as the proportion of total monthly household income per capita earned from all 
household  members’  jobs.  Non-labor  income  covers  retirement,  pensions,  rents,  social  transfers, 
unemployment  insurance  and  others.  Note  that  although  the  2000  Census  specified  the  income  quantities 
corresponding to different non-labor income sources, the 2010 Census database only provides a constructed 
aggregate for total  non-labor income. Thus, the distinction between labor and  non-labor income sources is 
the only one that we can fully identify at the municipality level between 2000 and 2010.22 

3.2. Descriptive statistics 

Table  1  reports  on  the  descriptive statistics  for  the  poverty  and  inequality  indicators  in  2000  and  2010,  as 
well  as  for  the  mean  household  per  capita  income  levels.  Two  poverty  thresholds  are  used  to  measure 
poverty:  a  R$  70  line  that  we  consider  captures  extreme  poverty;  and  a  R$  140  line  to  include  more 
moderate poverty in our numbers.23 Two poverty and two inequality indicators are presented: the headcount 
ratio and the poverty gap index (which places more weight on the poorest households), the Gini index and 
the  Theil  T  measure.  We  differentiate  between  the  municipality  of  Manaus  and  the  rest  of  the  state  of 
Amazonas (RAM hereafter), and present total Brazil and urban Brazil as benchmarks. 

<Table 1> 

As  expected,  poverty  decreased  in  the  four  areas  considered  between  2000  and  2010,  irrespective  of  the 
poverty  threshold  or  indicator  used.  Poverty  levels  (and  changes)  in  the  municipality  of  Manaus  are  very 
close to the average Brazilian situation (so still worse off than in urban Brazil). 

In  the  RAM,  where  urban  areas  accounted  for  just  51%  of  the  population  in  2000  and  58%  in  2010 
(compared to 99% for the metropolitan area of Manaus), poverty levels were three times higher (or more) in 
2010 than in  the state capital of Manaus (irrespective of the poverty line or  indicator used). In percentage 
points, poverty reductions were lower in the RAM with the exception of extreme poverty when considering 
the poverty gap index (with a decrease of 22.4% compared to 18.7% in Manaus). 

Turning  to  inequality,  Gini  and  Theil  index  decreases  are  again  observed  everywhere,  though  they  are 
smaller  in  Manaus  and  in  the  RAM  than  at  the  national  level  (urban  and  total  Brazil).  This  implies  that 
whereas  the  municipality  of  Manaus  had  a  slightly  less  unequal  income  distribution  than  the  average 
observed in Brazil in 2000, it was slightly more unequal in 2010.  

In  terms  of  average  income  (and  wage)  levels,  the  municipality  of  Manaus  posted  a  sharp  rise  in  the  last 
decade (a 38% increase in both mean monthly per capita income and mean hourly wages). This performance 
outweighs – by far for hourly wages - the already good results for urban Brazil (respectively 33% and 23%). 
Although household income levels were still lower in Manaus than the Brazilian averages (urban and total), 
workers were being relatively better paid in Manaus (with hourly wages averaging at R$ 10) than in urban 
Brazil (respectively at R$ 9.1) by 2010. In the RAM, mean household per capita income weighed in at just 
27% of the Brazilian average in 2000. Although the situation had improved by 2010 (at 32% of the Brazilian 
average), income (and wage) levels remained strikingly low.  

                                                 
21  For  urban  Brazil,  we  have  13.6  million  observations  (representing  122.5  million  individuals)  in  2000  and  14.7  million  observations 
(representing 148.4 million individuals) in 2010. For Brazil, the samples cover 18.1 million observations (representing 151.5 million individuals) 
in 2000 and 19.3 million observations (representing 176.9 million individuals) in 2010. 
22 Studies at the country level based on the Brazilian household survey (PNAD) can actually disentangle the different non-labor income sources, 
but as explained and unlike the Census data, the PNAD is not representative of the municipalities.  
23 Though Brazil does not have an official poverty line, ad-hoc administrative poverty lines of R$ 70 and R$ 140 can be used respectively for 
extreme poverty and poverty. They correspond to the 2009 values used to define the monetary benefits for the Brazilian main cash assistance 
program, Bolsa Familia. 

7 

 

To  sum  up,  although  poverty  and  inequality  indicators  fell  everywhere  in  the  2000-2010  decade,  income 
distribution  levels  and  trends  differed  between  Manaus  and  the  RAM.  Manaus  generally  posted  better 
indicators  close  to  the  average  situation  for  Brazil  and  even  sometimes  for  urban  Brazil,  while  the  RAM 
remained poor with high inequality. 

4. DECOMPOSITION METHODS 

Our first step to better understand the links between the economic performance of the area where the FTZM 
is established and observed changes in poverty and inequality indicators, is to perform a Shapley-Shorrocks 
estimate  of  the  standard  Datt-Ravallion  (1992)  poverty  decomposition  into  growth  and  redistribution 
components. Although there is  little doubt  that  economic growth  contributes  to  poverty  reduction,24 initial 
conditions  (in  terms  of  economic  development  or  inequality  levels)  and  growth  patterns  (i.e.  the  sector 
and/or  geographic  composition  of  economic  activity)  are  usually  behind  the  observed  heterogeneity  in  the 
poverty-growth relationship.25 Our aim is to explore if the state of Amazonas (both Manaus and the rest of 
the state) presents particularities compared to Brazil. 

Let the level of poverty at period t be written as a function 𝑃𝑡 = 𝑃(𝑧𝑡, 𝜇𝑡, 𝐿𝑡 ), where 𝑧𝑡 is the poverty line, 
𝜇𝑡 is the mean income and 𝐿𝑡 is the associated Lorenz curve, at date t, representing distributional inequality. 
Holding the poverty line constant over time, the overall change in poverty from the base period to the end 
period is equal to  

∆𝑃 = 𝑃(𝜇1, 𝐿1) −  𝑃(𝜇0, 𝐿0 ), 

The  Datt-Ravallion(1992)  method  measures,  in  a  ceteris  paribus  strategy,  how  much  of  observed  poverty 
changes  can  be  attributed  to  changes  in  income  growth  and  how  much  to  changes  along  the  income 
distribution, respectively known as the growth and redistribution effects, and represented below: 

Growth effect  = ∆𝜇 = 𝑃(𝜇1, 𝐿0) −  𝑃(𝜇0, 𝐿0 ) 

Redistribution effect = ∆𝐿 = 𝑃(𝜇0, 𝐿1) −  𝑃(𝜇0, 𝐿0 ) 

Note that  these expressions are counterfactual outcomes. In  order  to  amount to  observed poverty changes, 
they need to include a third argument, the residual, interpreted as an interaction effect between the growth 
and redistribution components. Additionally, different decompositions are possible depending on the period 
of reference (or path) taken, and no particular one is preferable a priori. In order to deal with these concerns, 
Shorrocks  (1999)  proposed,  and  Kolenikov  and  Shorrocks  (2005)  empirically  implemented  the  Shapley 
approach, deriving a single decomposition value that is always accurate (i.e. includes no residual) and treats 
all  possible  routes  symmetrically.  In  this  paper,  we  calculate  this  Shapley-Shorrocks  estimate  for  each 
component of the Datt-Ravallion decomposition using an algorithm proposed by Azevedo et al. (2012b). 

The  second  decomposition  method  we  apply  in  this  paper  generates  entire  counterfactual  income 
distributions  and  quantifies  the  contributions  that  changes  in  demographics,  employment,  labor  and  non-
labor  income  sources  may  have  made  to  observed  poverty  and  inequality  changes.  Following  the 
methodology proposed by Azevedo et al. (2012a), which builds on previous work by Barros et al. (2006), 
we decompose the contributions of different household income factors to observed distributional changes by 
simulating  the  distribution  of  monthly  total  household  per  capita  income,  changing  only  one  income 
component at a time and keeping everything else constant. 

In  concrete  terms,  we  begin  by  modelling  household  per  capita  income  (𝑦𝑝𝑐)  as  the  sum  of  individual 
income sources 𝑦𝑖 divided by the number of household members 𝑛. 

𝑦𝑝𝑐 =

24  A  partial  list  of  contributions  include  cross-country  studies  such  as  the  World  Bank  (1990,  2000),  Ravallion  and  Chen  (1997),  Datt  and 
Ravallion  (2002),  Dollar  and  Kray  (2002).  Recent  evidence  on  Latin  America  or,  more  specifically,  Brazil  includes  Menezes-Filho  and 
Vasconcellos (2006) and Inchauste et al. (2014).

If  we  assume  that  only  individuals  older  than  15  years  old  contribute  to  household  income,26  and  if  we 
capture  labor  (𝑦𝐿)  and  non-labor  (𝑦𝑁𝐿)  income  sources  separately,  we  can  write  per  capita  household 
income as: 

𝑦𝑝𝑐 =

𝑛𝐴
𝑛

(

𝑛𝐴

𝑛

𝐿
∑ 𝑦𝑖

𝑖=1

+

𝑛𝐴

∑ 𝑦𝑖

𝑁𝐿

) 

𝑛

𝑖=1

where  𝑛𝐴  is  the  number  of  adults  (as  of  15  years  old)  in  the  household.  Since  not  all  adults  work  in  a 
household,  we  can  go  one  step  further  and  differentiate  the  number  of  employed  (𝑛𝐸)  adults  from  those 
unemployed or inactive in the household such that our final decomposition reads: 

𝑦𝑝𝑐 =

𝑛𝐴
𝑛

(

𝑖=1

This equation enables us to decompose income changes into changes in two demographic components – the 
share of adults in the household and the share of the  occupied adults – and two income components – the 
contribution  of  labor  income  per  occupied  adult  and  the  contribution  of  non-labor  income  per  adult.  The 
decomposition  method  consists  in  constructing  counterfactual  distributions  by  substituting  the  observed 
distribution  for  each  component  in  one  period,  one  at  a  time,  until  we  attain  a  complete  change  from  that 
period to the next. For each counterfactual distribution, poverty (or inequality) measures are computed and 
interpreted as  the  level  of  poverty  (or  inequality)  that  would  have  prevailed  in  the absence  of  a  change  in 
that  indicator.  Note  that  since  sample  sizes  may  differ  from  one  period  to  the  next,  a  rank  rescaling 
procedure  is  applied  between  the  two  periods.  In  addition,  since  results  are  again  sensitive  to  the  order  in 
which effects are calculated (by component and over time), a Shapley value rule is also implemented here 
and decompositions calculated across all possible paths to present average results for each component (for 
more details on the decomposition method, see Azevedo et al. 2012a). 

In  order  to  capture  what  happened  in  the  Free  Trade  Zone  of  Manaus  and  place  our  results  in  a  country 
perspective, all estimations are again repeated separately for the municipality of Manaus, for the rest of the 
state  of  Amazonas  (RAM)  and  for  urban  Brazil  and  Brazil  as  a  whole.  Our  decomposition  results  are 
described in the next section. 

5. DECOMPOSITION RESULTS 

5.1. Decomposition Analysis into Growth and Redistribution Components 

The  Shapley-Shorrocks  estimate  of  the  Datt-Ravallion  (1992)  decomposition  quantifying  the  relative 
contributions of (distribution-neutral) growth versus redistribution to changes in poverty is performed using 
the headcount ratio and the poverty gap index, and using our two poverty thresholds (R$ 70 and R$ 140). 
Findings are reported in Table 2. Between 2000 and 2010, we find that growth explains a slightly larger part 
of the observed reduction in poverty (R$ 140) in Brazil; that is, if the Lorenz curve had remained constant 
over the decade, the poverty indexes would have decreased by approximately 54% due solely to growth in 
mean  incomes  over  the  period.27  When  we  focus  on  extreme  poverty  (poverty  line  fixed  at  R$  70),  the 
relative importance of the growth component generally drops in Brazil (down to values of 50% of the total 
change based on the headcount ratio). This decrease is larger when we focus on urban areas of Brazil only 
(from 54% down to values of 48 %). In Manaus, where the reduction in inequality was less significant over 
the  decade,  changes  in  poverty  over  the  same  time  period  are  essentially  explained  by  the  growth 
component, irrespective of which poverty indicator or threshold is used (the growth percentage contribution 
ranges  from  56%  to  63%).  In  the  RAM,  where  inequality  levels  are  more  persistent  and  still  very  high  in 

                                                 
26  Although  the  Brazilian  Census  surveys  ask  all  household  members  from  10  years  old  up  about  earnings,  given  that  schooling  in  Brazil  is 
compulsory until 14 years old, we fixed the bottom age threshold of our sample at 15.  
27 This result of growth as the slightly larger contributor to poverty reduction is in line with what is found by Inchauste et al. (2014) for Brazil 
using PNAD data for the similar 2001-2009 period (note that they use different international poverty lines, in PPP dollars, in order to draw up 
international comparisons). In their study (Figure 3.2 on page 45), Brazil appears as one of the three Latin American countries where the growth 
component contributes the least to poverty reduction (only Argentina and Paraguay display lower contributions of growth to poverty reduction 
over the decade).  

9 

 

2010,  the  observed  reductions  in  poverty  over  the  decade  are  clearly  the  result  of  distribution-neutral 
growth. 

<Table 2> 

To  conclude,  our  findings  from  the  above  decomposition  show  that,  over  this  decade  of  particularly  good 
economic  performance,  especially  in  the  FTZM,  growth  played  an  important  role  in  the  observed  poverty 
changes in the Amazonas state (not exclusively in the municipal area of Manaus). The role of redistribution, 
though similar to the growth component in Brazil, seems to have counted less in RAM and Manaus. If most 
of  the  poverty  reduction  observed  in  Manaus  and  the  RAM  in  this  past  decade  was  the  result  of  mean 
income growth, the obvious question that arises is how household per capita income growth reduced poverty 
and which particularities can be found for the FTZM area.  

5.2. Decomposition Analysis into Demographics and Income Components 

Our  second  decomposition  exercise  provides  a  better  understanding  of  the  factors  behind  poverty  and 
inequality  reductions.  At  least  three  factors  could  have  influenced  poverty  and  inequality  declines: 
demographic  changes  (particularly  the  share  of  adults  per  household);  growth  in  labor  income  (either 
because  more  people  are  employed  or  because  their  earnings  have  increased),  and  growth  in  non-labor 
income (in the form of public or private transfers or possibly savings patterns).  

<Table 3> 

Before  presenting  our  decomposition  results,  Table  3  shows  descriptive  statistics  on  the  changes  in  these 
factor components for the entire population as well as for the poor and extremely poor to make it easier to 
understand our  decomposition  exercise.  Over the  2000-2010  decade,  the  average number  of  hours  worked 
decreased everywhere (Manaus, RAM, urban and total Brazil), for the whole population as well as for poor 
households.  This  change,  together  with  the  observed  overall  increase  in  hourly  wages,  captures  the 
economy-wide improvement in working conditions in the country.28 Note that, whereas the average number 
of hours worked was higher in Manaus than in Brazil in 2000 (looking at both urban and total samples), this 
was  no  longer  the  case  in  2010.29  Over  the  same  time  period,  the  share  of  adults  per  household  increased 
everywhere.  Indeed  Brazil  has  been  experiencing  a  typical  demographic  transition  in  recent  decades,  with 
sustained declines in  mortality rates since the 1940s and fertility falling sharply  at  a  much faster  rate than 
mortality  since  the late 1960s  (see,  for  example,  Gragnolati  et  al.,  2011).  As  expected  in  such  a  large and 
heterogeneous  country,  demographic  indicators  in  Brazil  vary  considerably  across  geographic  areas.  Here 
we see that both Manaus and the RAM have lower shares of adults per household than found in the national 
figures.  When  we  focus  on  the  poor  or  when  figures  include  rural  areas  (total  Brazil  compared  to  urban 
Brazil; the RAM compared to Manaus), the relative number of adults in the household is smaller. The share 
of occupied adults in the household increased over the 2000-2010 decade for the entire population and in all 
areas considered, but converse trends appear when only the poor are considered (irrespective of whether we 
look  at households with an income per capita  under R$ 70 or  R$ 140).  In  terms of levels, the situation in 
Manaus is close to the Brazilian average while the share of occupied adults in the household is much smaller 
in the RAM. 

Table  4  displays  the  results  of  our  decomposition  into  demographic  and  income  components  for  poverty 
measures  and  Table  5  for  inequality  measures.  We  present  the  respective  contributions  of  demographics, 
employment, labor income and non-labor income factors to observed reductions in poverty and inequality in 
the  municipality  of  Manaus,  in  the  RAM,  and  in  urban  and  total  Brazil.  We  will  first  present  the  results 
common  to  all  areas.  Then  we  will  identify  particularities  in  the  area  of  Manaus  that  could  point  to  the 
influence  of  the  FTZM  and  the  existence  (or  absence)  of  spillover  effects  in  the  rest  of  the  state  of 
Amazonas.  

                                                 
28 Brazil’s labor market performed well in the 2000s, with strong rates of job creation and formal job growth outpacing informal job growth by a 
three-to-one ratio (see below and, among others, Berg, 2010).  
29 Although the general decrease in the number of hours worked can be linked to a positive reading of increased formality and improved working 
conditions,  the  fact  that  the  lowest  work  duration  is  found  among  the  extreme  poor  in  all  samples  may  reveal  some  barriers  to  employment 
opportunities for certain disadvantaged population groups. 

10 

 

<Table 4> 

First  of all, the demographic transition  that  started in  Brazil in  past decades and  continued over the 2000-
2010 period, with rises in the share of the working-age population and the elderly, contributed everywhere to 
a reduction in poverty, irrespective of the poverty measure or threshold used (Table 4), as it did to inequality 
declines  (Table  5).  With  respect  to  the  poverty  decompositions,  the  RAM,  which  includes  many  rural 
municipalities,  is  where  demographics  plays  a  greater  role  (shares  increasing  16.5%  to  21.3%),  while  the 
share of adults per household accounts for up to 14% in Manaus. When it comes to reductions in inequality, 
however, the demographic transition has the greatest impact in Manaus, not in the RAM. Yet differences are 
less marked within the state. 

When we focus on the role played by the share of occupied adults per household, we obtain mixed results in 
both  poverty  and  inequality.  Looking  at  the  poverty  decompositions  (Table  4),  although  the  share  of 
working  adults  per  household  declined  among  the  poor  in  all  our  samples  over  the  decade  (Table  3),  this 
change had a different effect across the income distribution. The household employment rate drop is found 
to have a positive impact on poverty reduction when the higher R$ 140 threshold is used, but not necessarily 
when  we  focus  on  the  extreme  poor.  This  may  be  interpreted  as  a  positive  effect  of  better  labor  market 
conditions,  particularly  growth  in  mean  hourly  wages,30  which  could  possibly  allow  young  household 
members to  stay in  school and older adults to retire.  Yet this  effect would only  apply  to those individuals 
closer  to  the  higher  poverty  thresholds.  At  lower  income  levels,  the  positive  effect  of  employment  rate 
decreases  in  the  household  could  actually  become  negative.  Note  that  there  is  not  a  clear  pattern  to  the 
relative  importance  of  this  factor  across  samples,  which  is  probably  linked  to  this  dual  role  across  the 
income distribution. Inequality decompositions, on the other  hand, display a systematically positive,  albeit 
small,  role  of  household  employment  shares  in  Manaus  (7%  to  12%  using  the  Gini  and  Theil  indexes 
respectively), with a fairly large negative effect in the RAM (similarly, 52% to 57%). Thus, the increase in 
employment  shares  within  households  across  the  total  population  (see  Table  3)  is  a  source  of  income 
inequality  in  the  RAM  whereas  it  slightly  reduces  it  in  Manaus.  Differential  changes  in  the  sector-based 
structure  of  employment  may  explain  these  results:  for  example,  the  share  of  public  administration  jobs 
(known to  be  among the better paid jobs) in the RAM increased over the decade, while there the share of 
agricultural jobs contracted. The sector-based employment structure is much more stable in Manaus. 

Turning  now  to  labor  income,  we  find  that  growth  in  labor  income  almost  always  leads  to  a  decline  in 
poverty. The only exception is when we look at extreme poverty using the poverty gap index, particularly in 
those samples that include rural areas (the RAM and our total Brazilian sample). The fact that the influence 
of  labor  income  on  poverty  reduction  seems  to  fade  away  for  these  extremely  poor  populations  when  the 
poverty gap index is used (an index that overrepresents the poorest of the poor) may be explained by the fact 
that the extremely poor do not yet have full access to the Brazilian labor market and do not benefit as much 
from the recent positive developments on this market at the country level.31 The impact of labor income on 
poverty  reduction  is  much  greater  relatively  speaking  in  Manaus  than  in  the  three  other  areas  considered, 
irrespective of the poverty measure or threshold used (ranging from 20% for the poverty gap to 50% of total 
poverty reduction based on the headcount index with the lowest R$ 70 threshold). In the RAM, the greatest 
impact on poverty reduction by labor income reaches just 26% (again with the headcount index and the R$ 
140 poverty line). In urban Brazil, it jumps as high as 35% (again for the headcount and the R$ 140 line), a 
number  significantly  lower  than  observed  in  Manaus.  Turning  now  to  our  results  for  the  inequality 
decompositions (Table 5), the highest contributor to inequality reduction is without doubt labor income, both 
in Manaus and Brazil (urban and total samples), with the highest impact of labor income again observed in 
the municipality of Manaus. In the RAM, however, the non-labor income factor takes the lead in reducing 
both Gini and Theil indexes.  

                                                 
30 Note that the average number of hours worked by the poor dropped over the decade, so it is probably not due to workers working more hours. 
An alternative explanation might be found in the increase in social protection coverage (pensions and social transfers). Yet it is less clear why 
the poorest of the poor would benefit less in this case. A mix of the two factors is probably at play. 
31  Lavinas  (2013,  p.  31)  comes  to  a  similar  conclusion  for  Brazil:  “The  effects  of  economic  growth  were  not  as  favorable  to  those  living  in 
extreme poverty as they had been for those classed simply as ‘poor’. The much lower levels of schooling, and the even more precarious, badly 
paid jobs held by the indigent, make them much less likely to benefit from upward trends in the job market.”

<Table 5> 

Lastly, changes in non-labor income over the 2000-2010 decade always lead to a reduction in poverty. The 
contribution  of  non-labor  income  to  poverty  changes  is  higher  when  poverty  is  measured  using  the  lower 
poverty threshold of R$ 70 or the poverty gap index. So as expected, the relative weight of non-labor income 
grows  when  we  focus  on  the  poorest  of  the  poor:  either  by  restricting  our  study  to  changes  in  extreme 
poverty (capturing households below R$ 70 per month) rather than including households with monthly per 
capita incomes of between R$ 70 and R$ 140 in our poverty numbers; or by giving the poorest of the poor 
more weight in our poverty calculations by using the poverty gap index instead of the headcount ratio. Note 
that,  although  our  measure  of  non-labor  income  covers  a  range  of  heterogeneous  sources  (theoretically 
including social transfers, pensions, capital income, etc.), the fact that our poverty decompositions focus on 
the very low end of the income distribution allows us to presume the essential role played by public transfers 
in  this  non-labor  income  component.  In  particular,  we  can  assume  that  pensions32  and  the  Bolsa  Familia 
Program  (BFP)  –  Brazil’s  “flagship”  conditional  cash  transfer  program  covering  12.8  million  families  in 
2010 despite its relatively  small  benefit amounts33 – have  both  played  a role  in improving extremely poor 
families’  living  standards.34  Our  inequality  decompositions,  which  are  not  restricted  to  the  low  end  of  the 
distribution,  find a mixed role for non-labor income.  Although non-labor income  reduces inequality in the 
RAM  and  in  Brazil  (urban  and  total  samples),  it  drives  up  inequality  in  Manaus.  In  addition,  non-labor 
income  plays  a  smaller  role  when  only  the  urban  sample  is  considered  than  when  the  entire  Brazilian 
population  is  taken  into  account.  These  mixed  results  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  non-labor  income 
measure contains more capital income in urban areas.  

The  relative  weight  of  the  labor  income  factor  in  poverty  and  inequality  reduction  in  emerging  and 
developing countries compared to other factors such as non-labor income is a subject of recent debate. For 
example, Inchauste et al. (2014), using a similar time frame (2001-2009) to ours and international poverty 
lines  in  PPP  dollars35,  show  for  a  sample  of  21  countries  (including  Brazil)  that,  "The  most  important 
contributor to reductions in moderate poverty has been the growth in labor income. In particular, among 12 
of  them  with  substantial  declines  in  poverty,  changes  in  labor  income  and  employment  explain  more  than 
half of the change in poverty; in another 6 countries, the same changes account for more than 40 percent of 
reduced poverty".  

In the specific case of Brazil, our results are in line with recent evidence despite the fact that our study uses 
census data and is therefore not strictly comparable to research based on Brazilian household surveys. For 
example, Inchauste et al. (2014) find in their abovementioned study of Brazil (using PNAD surveys) that the 
most important factor for poverty reduction when measured by the lowest poverty lines (US$ 1.25 a day) is 
growth in non-labor income.36 It is only when the highest poverty line is considered (US$ 4 a day) that labor 
income  becomes  the  most  important  contributor.  On  inequality,  Azevedo  et  al.  (2013b)  -  using  the  same 
decomposition technique and PNAD surveys for the 2001-2011 period - show that the contributions of labor 
income and non-labor income to the Gini coefficient downturn come to 45% and 46% respectively. Using a 
similar  decomposition  approach  (despite  some  methodological  differences)  and  again  PNAD  surveys, 
Barros  et  al.  (2010)  find  that  decreases  in  inequality  (measured  successively  by  a  Gini  coefficient  and  the 
ratio between the income of the richest 20 percent and the poorest 20 percent)  were due to changes in the 

                                                 
32 Public pensions have largely benefited from growth in the minimum wage as two thirds of public pensions correspond to the minimum wage 
(Lavinas, 2013).  
33  According  to  data  from  the  Social  Development  Ministry  (Ministerio  do  Desenvolvimento  Social),  5.6%  of  the  people  living  in  the 
municipality of Manaus received the BFP in 2010, compared to 8% for the state of Amazonas and 6.7% in Brazil as a whole. 
34 Soares (2012) reviews several studies on the impact of the BFP on poverty and inequality in Brazil: the BFP has had a growing impact on 
poverty  reduction  over  time  and  its  influence  is  also  stronger  when  the  intensity  of  poverty  is  taken  into  account.  Nevertheless,  although 
evaluations vary greatly (mainly because of studies’ methodological differences), the BFP has had a modest effect on inequality reduction. The 
author also underlines that the cost of the BFP - dubbed “a little big program” (p. 6) - is low considering its wide coverage, but “in spite of the 
improvement of welfare among those who remain poor, greater impacts on the percentage in poverty require higher benefits” (p .22). 
35 Inchauste et al. (2014) consider several international poverty lines, respectively US$1.25, US$2.50, US$4.00 for Brazil (the two lowest ones 
being the most adequate for comparisons with our two poverty lines). 
36 Taking the US$ 1.25-a-day poverty line, the shares are 47.9% for non-labor income versus 44.7% for labor income based on the headcount 
ratio  and  75.3%  and  28.1%  respectively  using  the  poverty  gap  index.  Taking  the  US$  2.50-a-day  poverty  line,  non-labor  income  is  the  most 
important contributor in the case of the poverty gap index (45.2% versus 41.7%), but not with the headcount ratio (31.7% versus 44.8%).

distribution of non-labor income per adult37 in 40-50% of cases and to changes in the distribution of labor 
income per adult (taking the proportion of working adults and labor income per working adult) in 31-46% of 
cases between 2001 and 2007. Our results on inequality in Brazil find that labor income has an even greater 
influence. In addition, we find a clear distinctive pattern within the state of Amazonas: the predominant role 
that labor income appears to play in Manaus contrasts with the major influence of non-labor income in the 
RAM in explaining poverty and inequality dynamics. This greater relative importance of labor income in the 
municipality  of  Manaus  might  be,  at  least  in  part,  due  to  the  FTZM’s  good  economic  performance 
throughout the 2000-2010 decade. 

5.3. Comparability issues on contributions to poverty reduction.  

Attempts to clearly capture the FTZM’s causal effects on welfare outcomes would call for a counterfactual 
of  the  situation  without  the  FTZM,  which  is  not  possible.  Alternative  quasi-experimental  methods  that 
exploit  time  and  cross-section  variations  in  SEZs’  establishment  across  municipalities  have  been  recently 
implemented to understand the impact of SEZs on some economic outcomes (for example by Wang, 2013). 
Unfortunately,  the  FTZM  is  a  rather  unique  and  evolving  experience  in  Brazil  (for  example,  as  already 
mentioned,  the  FTZM  is  the  only  Brazilian  FTZ  engaged  in  production  operations  in  the  2000s),  which 
makes  such  methods  inapplicable.  The  synthetic  control  approach,  which  provides  a  way  to  address  the 
problem of having only one single observation unit being treated, is often cited as an alternative evaluation 
technique.  However,  this  method  is  not  a  panacea  despite  its  many  advantages.  For  example,  it  requires 
various years of comparable pre-intervention data for treated and control units. Moreover, the method fails 
to  create  suitable  synthetic  counterfactual  matches  in  the  pre-treatment  period  in  the  absence  of  a  large 
subset of units in the population looking a priori ‘similar’ to the treated unit (and Manaus can be considered 
a  singular  case  in  Brazil).  Facing  such  limitations,  we  have  nevertheless  tried  to  provide  a  framework  for 
comparison by running our statistical micro-decomposition methods on the rest of Brazilian municipalities. 
To  the  initial  year  5209  municipalities,  we  have  added  some  additional  constraints  in  order  to  focus  on  a 
subsample  of  municipalities  with  ex-ante  ‘similar’  characteristics  in  terms  of  demographics  and 
distributional  outcomes.  In  particular,  we  concentrate  on  those  municipalities  that  initially  are  in  the  same 
Brazilian quartile than Manaus, in terms of share of urban population, mean per capita household income, 
mean  number  of  wealth  assets,  mean  years  of  schooling  and  mean  number  of  children  in  the household.38 
We have also restricted to those municipalities where the manufacturing sector represents more than 10% of 
the working population. These selection criteria leave us with only fifteen other ex-ante ‘similar’ municipal 
areas, showing how specific the case of Manaus within Brazil is.39  

<Figure 2> 

Figure 2  plots all  observed poverty changes during the 2000-2010 decade in  these municipalities  and puts 
them  in  perspective  with  respect  to:  (i)  their  growth  component  in  the  Datt-Ravallion  decomposition 
(Subfigure  2a)  and  (ii)  their  labor  income  component  in  the  demographics  versus  income  decomposition 
(Subfigure  2b).  We  see  that  among  this  subsample  of  municipalities,  Manaus  has  been  the  one  where 
poverty  has  diminished  the  most  in  percentage  points  during  the  2000-2010  decade,  after  Fortaleza  (the 
capital of the state of Céarà in the North East, and one of the main touristic destinations in Brazil). In terms 
of  the  importance  in  observed  poverty  changes  of  the  growth  component  versus  redistribution,  Manaus  is 
among  the  three  top  shares.  Though  Manaus  does  not  have  the  largest  labor  income  component  in  our 
demographics  versus  income  components  decomposition,  it  nevertheless  figures  among  the  highest  (only 

                                                 
37  The  authors  decomposed  non-labor  income  in  seven  sources:  rents,  interest  and  dividends,  private  transfers  from  non-residents,  private 
pensions  and  three  types  of  public  transfers  (pensions  and  other  standard  contributory  social  security  benefits,  Beneficio  de  Prestaçào 
Continuada – BPC is a transfer for people aged 65 and over and disabled –Bolsa Familia and similar programs). Public transfers explain 49% of 
the total reduction in inequality with the role of contributory transfers being predominant (almost 30%). 
38 Note that we are not imposing to select municipalities with equal mean values, which would clearly be too restrictive, but only to select those 
with  a  similar  quartile  position in  the  Brazilian distribution  of means,  for  each  criterion.  Also,  we  are  calculating  quartiles  on  all  initial  5209 
municipalities for each criterion, and not sequentially in remaining subsamples, which could artificially diminish sample size. A similar position 
criterion defined by quintiles ended us selecting a sample of even less municipalities.  
39 Among the fifteen municipalities, one corresponds to the state of Céarà (Fortaleza); six to Minas Gerais (Araxa, Coronel Fabriziano, Ipatinga, 
Joao Monvelade, Sao Lorenço and Timoteo), one to Rio de Janeiro (Mendes), six to Sao Paulo (Campo Limpo Paulista, Cubatao, Embu-Guaçu, 
Hortolandia, Itaperica da Serra, and Jandira) and one to Mato Grosso (Varzea Grande).

five municipalities seem to have experienced higher labor income shares, but all at lower levels of poverty 
reduction). These results hint once again to the positive influence of the good economic performance of the 
FTZM within the municipality of Manaus on poverty reduction.40 

 

6. CONCLUSION 

The recent proliferation and wide range of SEZs in emerging and developing countries show that these types 
of policies are more than just a trade openness instrument. They are part of a broader economic development 
strategy  to  promote  additional  investment,  scale  up  technology  transfers,  increase  employment  and  fight 
regional  inequalities,  among  others.  Although  SEZs  appear  to  have  found  increasing  support  among 
developing  nation  governments  as  a  means  to  expand  and  modernize  the  economy,  their  economic 
effectiveness and social repercussions are the subject of ongoing debate. 

This  article  focuses  on  the  case  of  the  Free  Trade  Zone  of  Manaus  (FTZM)  in  Brazil  to  gain  a  better 
understanding of the impact of SEZs on distributional outcomes. The FTZM is a particularly suitable case 
for an analysis of the influence of a SEZ on poverty and inequality due to its location in an isolated, poor 
enclave  of  the  country.  The  FTZM  was  designed  from  the  outset  as  a  regional  development  strategy  to 
address the lack of economic buoyancy and harsh living conditions in the area. Trade liberalization measures 
and, more generally, fiscal incentives have now made it a dynamic industrial hub  - operating as an import 
processing zone - in the middle of the Amazon rainforest.  

The  2000-2010  decade  was  a  period  of  significant,  widespread  improvements  in  poverty  and  inequality 
indicators in Brazil. The state of Amazonas, where the FTZM is located, was no exception to this trend. This 
analysis  seeks to  identify the possible sets of factors behind the reduction in  poverty and inequality in  the 
Amazonas state, and investigate the role played by the FTZM. In order to do so, we use census data to study 
the municipality of Manaus, where the FTZM is established, representing the central economic activity, and 
also look at the rest of the state of Amazonas for potential spillover effects. 

In the 2000-2010 decade, income growth was the most important factor behind observed poverty changes in 
Amazonas  state  (not  solely  in  the  municipal  area  of  Manaus).  The  role  of  redistribution,  although  very 
similar in importance to the growth component in Brazil, seems to have always counted less in Manaus and 
especially in the rest of the state of Amazonas (RAM). Among the poverty and inequality reduction drivers, 
our second micro-decomposition exercise finds that labor income plays a major role in Manaus (whereas the 
contribution  of  non-labor  income  is  far  more  important  in  the  RAM).  Comparison  with  a  priori  ‘similar’ 
municipalities, at least with respect to a short list of distributional and demographic criteria, corroborates the 
relative  success  in  terms  of  poverty  reduction  observed  in  Manaus  as  well  as  the  essential  role  played  by 
income  growth,  and  labor  income  specifically.  We  believe  our  results  illustrate  both  the  benefits  and 
limitations of the FTZM’s good economic performance over the last decade. 

Labor  market  buoyancy  in  the  municipality  of  Manaus  is  closely  linked  with  the  FTZM’s  success  driving 
direct  and  indirect  job  creations.  Not  only  did  the  share  of  employed  adults  in  households  grow,  but  the 
income  gains  perceived  by  the  workers  also  rose  while  the  number  of  hours  worked  fell,  evidencing  an 
improvement in job quality. Our micro-decomposition approaches find that these labor market developments 
contributed significantly to poverty and inequality reduction in the state capital. And robustness tests show 
that these results could not be attributed to alternative explanations, such as, for example the slightly larger 
presence of public administration and defense jobs in Manaus. 

In  the  RAM,  where  poverty  and  inequality  levels  were  still  high  in  2010  and  considerably  higher  than  in 
Manaus,  the  much  lower  incidence  of  the  labor  income  component  points  to  problems  of  weak 
“employability” among the poor (as already mentioned, migration across municipalities in Amazonas state 
and  also  to  other  states  is  particularly  low  in  this  region).  The  spillover  effects  of  the  FTZM  in  the  state 
might  be  said  to  be  still  limited.  However,  without  the  FTZM,  the  situation  would  probably  have  been 

                                                 
40 Similar results for inequality decompositions have been estimated where Manaus appears about half way in terms of inequality reduction in 
percentage points. In any case, among the selected municipalities, only five show a larger role for labor income in the fall of inequality.

worse,  not  only  in  terms  of  social  outcomes,  but  also  possibly  from  an  ecological  point  of  view.  For 
example, in a household-level interview study of Ecuadorian Amazon migrant farmers in 1990, Murphy et 
al.  (1997)  already  discuss  how  economic  development  in  small  urban  areas  in  the  Amazon  Rainforest 
Frontier  could  increase  employment  opportunities  (in  local  government,  retail  sales,  services  and 
ecotourism) and how increasing such opportunities could alleviate pressure to keep clearing the forest. More 
recently, comparisons of deforestation and predatory vegetal extraction rates with other Amazonian states in 
Brazil rate the state of Amazonas among the lowest ranks. This result is often put forward as an indicator of 
the  FTZM’s  positive  environmental  impact  since  the  FTZM’s  attractiveness  and  buoyancy  have 
concentrated people and economic activity in the capital city of Manaus (see Rivas et al. 2012). In addition 
to  ecological  arguments,  the  creation  of  the  FTZM  is  also  regarded  as  a  successful  regional  development 
strategy,  contributing  to  the  spatial  decentralization  of  Brazilian  industrial  activities  (see  Saboia  and 
Kubrusly, 2015).41 

While the FTZM’s spillover effects may still be limited, it is also rather bothersome to find that non-labor 
income appears to contribute less to poverty reduction in the RAM than in Brazil as a whole. We interpret 
this  result  as  probable  evidence  of  social  transfer  targeting  problems  in  remote  areas  of  the  state. 
Recommendations to improve social outcomes in poorer areas of the Amazon region could include the need 
for training programs for the poor to improve their “employability” and better targeting of social policies in 
the area. 

The  work  in  this  paper  suggests  a  number  of  extensions.  Up  to  now,  we  have  focused  on  the  total 
population,  to  better  capture  evolutions  of  income  distribution  measures  such  as  monthly  household  per 
capita income poverty and inequality. Though beyond the scope of this paper, a detailed analysis focusing 
only  on  workers  from  the  FTZM  is  our  natural  step  forward.  In  future  research  we  should  dig  into 
disentangling how much of observed overall changes in the wage distribution in the FTZM specifically, and 
in Manaus, could be attributable to changes in observable characteristics of the population, and how much 
would remain unexplained (that is, due to changes in returns to labor market skills or other factors).

41 In Brazil, federal and  state  governments and  municipalities have  implemented measures in  past  decades to  attract investments  and firms  to 
regions less developed than the main urban coastal areas. The FTZM is seen as successful from this  point of view (see Saboia and Kubrusly, 
2015).  Naturally,  the  FTZM’s  special  regime  has  a  cost,  and  the  recent  extension  of  fiscal  incentives  through  to  2073  may  suggest  that  the 
federal government does not believe the region is ready for autonomous development.
