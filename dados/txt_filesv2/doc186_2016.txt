Abstract 

The  Brazilian  Sertão  is  the  most  populous  semiarid  region  in  the  world,  and  faces  the  highest  rates  of 
poverty  and  food  insecurity  in  Brazil.  Irregular  rainfall  and  climate  variability  make  these  social 
constraints  even  more  difficult  to  be  solved  in  the  short  term,  since  basic  economic  activities  in  the 
region,  such  as  dairy  farming  and  subsistence  agriculture,  tend  to  be  affected  mainly  by  recurrent  and 
prolonged droughts. This study analyzes the impacts of climate conditions on the agricultural production 
and  how  adaptative  strategies  may  alleviate  such  effects.  First,  it  analyzes  the  dynamics  of  climate 
variables  between  1974  and  2013  in  the  semi-arid  region  of  the  State  of  Bahia,  the  largest  and  most

1.  Introduction 

With  a  population  estimated  at  more  than  22  million  people  in  2010,  the  Brazilian  Sertão  is  the  most 
populous semiarid region in the world. Despite recent improvements, the region still presents the highest 
rates of poverty and food insecurity in Brazil. Irregular rainfall and climate variability make these social 
constraints even more difficult to be solved in the short run, since basic economic activities in the region, 
such  as  dairy  farming  and  subsistence  agriculture,  tend  to  be  affected  mainly  by  the  recurrence  of 
prolonged droughts.  Studies suggest  that the  average temperature in  Sertão increased  by  approximately 
2°C  over  the  past  40  years,  while  the  average  precipitation  fell  between  300  and  450  mm,  which 
corresponds to a reduction of 30% (Burney et al. 2014). 

The practice of extensive livestock farming prevails in the region and exposes the animals directly to the 
natural environmental conditions and, hence, to the impacts of climate changes. Studies suggest that the 
loss  in  milk  production  in  the  region  may  vary  from  3  to  7  kg/day,  depending  on  the  extent  of  climate 
changes (Silva et al. 2010). Moreover, according to the most pessimistic forecasts, an increase of almost 
6° C in the average temperature would induce a drop in land availability and provoke negative effects on 
the regional GDP, which could decrease by nearly 14% (Domingues, Magalhaes, and Ruiz 2011; Krol et 
al. 2001). The agricultural activities would suffer a significant decline, with a reduction of nearly 20% in 
all states of the region. 

In such a relevant environmental, social and economic context, this study has three main objectives. First, 
it analyzes the dynamics of climate variables between 1974 and 2013 in the semi-arid region of the State 
of Bahia, the largest and most populous State of the Sertão. Secondly, based on a panel with climatic and 
production data, it assesses the ex-post impacts of these climate variables on the agricultural production 
of the municipalities in  the region.  Thirdly, it estimates the relation  between several  adaptive strategies 
and the agricultural family farmers’ production, based on microdata of the Brazilian Agricultural Census 
2006 for small farmers in the region. The study evaluates five main agricultural productions: milk, cattle, 
goat, sheep and corn. The final and general aim of this study is to discuss the effectiveness of strategies 
for  small  farmers  which  would  create  climate  resilience  and  attenuate  the  negative  impacts  of  climate 
change on the agricultural production of this vulnerable region. 

 

2.  Theoretical background 

Climate changes are expected to cause several impacts on the semiarid regions, including water scarcity, 
increases in average temperature and the frequency of extreme events, such as prolonged droughts (IPCC 
2014; Kahil, Dinar, and Albiac 2015). There is also the risk of desertification in some areas, as a result of 
reduced  natural  vegetation  and  increasing  degree  of  soil  aridity  (Becerril-Pina  et  al.  2015;  Herrera-
Pantoja and Hiscock 2015). 

In  Brazil,  the  agricultural  activity  prevailing  in  semiarid  regions  is  the  extensive  livestock  in  family 
farms, which directly exposes the animals to natural environmental conditions and, consequently, to the 
impacts of climate changes (Andrade-Montemayor et al. 2011). In addition to high exposition to natural 

2 

 

 
phenomena, these less developed regions simply lack basic social and economic capital that is needed to 
adapt  to  new  environmental  constraints,  such  as  investments  in  infrastructure  and  adaptative  strategies 
(Maharjan and Joshi 2013; Wreford, Moran, and Adger 2010; Mendelsohn and Dinar 2009). 

The climatic instability can severely limit livestock productivity in these regions, through, for example, 
water scarcity, reduction in the provision and quality of pastures and forages, and increasing number of 
animal  deaths  associated  with  prolonged  droughts  and  severe  conditions  of  heat  stress  (Megersa  et  al. 
2014;  Lioubimtseva  and  Henebry  2009).  As  a  result,  climate  change  may  also  impact  on  the  farmers’ 
choices  for  different  types  of  agricultural  activity.  Kabubo-Mariara  (2008),  for  example,  suggests  that 
increasing average temperatures and reducing precipitations tend to make farmers more likely to migrate 
from dairy to beef cattle, and from goat to sheep farming. 

The  change  toward  herds  that  are  naturally  more  resistant  to  the  extreme  climate  conditions  of  the 
semiarid regions may be a growing trend with climate changes. Larger animals face more difficulties to 
eliminate the excess of  heat,  which would  reduce their  food intake and  make them more susceptible to 
suffer  from  heat  stress  (Wreford,  Moran,  and  Adger  2010;  Maharjan  and  Joshi  2013;  Mendelsohn  and 
Dinar  2009).  Larger  animals  are  also  more  vulnerable  to  water  and  food  scarcity  compared  to  smaller 
animals like goats and sheep. 

Several  adaptative  strategies  can  also  attenuate  the  impacts  of  climate  changes  on  the  agricultural 
activities  of  semiarid  regions.  According  to  Wossen  et  al.  (2014),  combined  strategies  of  credit  and 
irrigation  supply  have  been  effective  in  reducing  poverty  rates  and  the  risk  associated  with  climate 
variability  in  drought  years.  Pinheiro  (2012)  and  INSA  (2008)  also  highlight  the  need  of  structural 
changes in farms, such as the confinement and shadding of the livestock, which are essential to minimize 
production losses, alleviating the negative  effects of increases in temperature.  Burney et  al.  (2014) also 
highlight  the  potential  benefits  of  irrigation  and  supplemental  feeding  of  animals.  Although  both 
irrigation and food supplementation are cost-effective, they depend severely on the availability of water 
and  infra-structure  in  the  farms.  Thus,  public  and  private  programs  to  subsidize  the  access  to  water  for 
small farmers are essential, either through groundwater or the construction of dams or tanks.  

 

3.  Empirical framework 

3.1.Data source 

Minimum comparable areas 

The  impact  of  climate  change  on  agricultural  production  is  analyzed  using  the  smaller  territorial  units 
available  in  Brazil.  Although  socio-economic  data  for  266  municipalities  of  the  Bahia  semi-arid  region 
were  available,  many  of  them  have  emancipated  in  the  period  of  analysis.  This  means  that  the  total 
number  of  municipalities  in  1974  does  not  correspond  to  that  of  2013,  neither  do  their  regional 
boundaries.  In order to  consider the changes implemented in  the  Brazilian Territorial  Division  between 
1974  and  2013,  the  266  municipalities  of  Bahia's  semiarid  region  were  aggregated  into  206  Minimum 
Comparable  Areas  (MCAs)  according  to  the  methodology  proposed  by  the  Brazilian  Institute  of 
Geography  and  Statistics  (IBGE)  and  the  Institute  of  Applied  Economic  Research  (IPEA)  (Reis  et  al. 
2011). Each MCA consists of one or more municipalities, historically comparable, i.e., integrated areas of 
the territory before emancipations realized during the analysis period. 

 

Climate data 

Climatic data were obtained from conventional weather stations of the National Meteorological Institute 
(INMET). These data refer to historical series of climatic variables for the 26 weather stations in Bahia 
and  4  stations  located  in  the  northern  region  of  Minas  Gerais,  all  them  located  in  semi-arid  regions. 
Variables comprise daily data of maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature and 

 

3 

 
total precipitation between the years 1974 and 2013. However, information for the years 1981-1985 and 
1989-1991 were not available. 

Daily  data  were  interpolated  through  the  206  MCAs  located  in  the  semiarid  region  of  Bahia.  The 
interpolation was performed by the method of Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) using the package gstat 
of geostatistical analysis developed by (Pebesma 2004) for the statistical program R. The IDW method is 
based on the weighted linear combination of the data collected in each meteorological station, using the 
inverse  of  the  distance  as  weighting  factor  (Amorin  et  al.  2011).  After  interpolation,  the  average  daily 
values of climate variables were estimated for each of the MCAs in the region. 

The description and  average values of the  climate variables used in  the  analyses are shown in  Table 1. 
Overall, results highlight the high levels of average temperatures and the low levels of rainfall, measured 
by the number of days per year without rain. The average annual temperature varied between 23 C and 
24  C,  while  the  number  of  days  per  year  with  precipitation  lower  than  1  mm  varied  between  232  and 
272.

Agricultural production 

Information  of  agricultural  production  and  population  in  the  semiarid  of  Bahia  were  obtained  from  the 
IBGE  System  of  Automatic  Recovery  (SIDRA)  and  refer  to  the  following  surveys:  i)  Municipal 
Livestock  Survey  (PPM);  ii)  Demographic  Census.  This  information  was  originally  available  to 
municipalities, that were aggregated into the 206 MCAs. Table 1 describes the variables used in analyses, 
which were largely limited to the availability of annual information for all semiarid locations. Five types 
of  production  and  productivity  were  considered:  productivity  of  milk  (variable  pmilk),  cattle  (cattle), 
goats (goat), sheep (sheep) and production of corn (corn). Information on milk productivity refers to the 
period  1974  to  2013.  Information  on  livestock  production,  goat  and  sheep  refers  to  the  period  1974  to 
2012.  In  turn,  information  on  corn  production  was  available  exclusively  for  the  period  2003-2013. 
Information on rural population (prural) was only available for the census years: 1970, 1980, 1991, 2000 

 

4 

 
and 2010.  Values between the  census  years were estimated  based on  the average  growth  rates  for each 
MCA. 

Despite the persistence of rural exodus in recent decades, the semiarid of Bahia still has a significant rural 
population,  with  2.6  million  residents  in  2014.  The  productivity  of  milk,  one  of  the  main  agricultural 
products in the region, is low: 499 liters per cow in 2013, a value that is substantially below the national 
average, which was 1492 liters per cow in the same year. Cattle farming prevails in the region (nearly 6 
million heads in 2013), although the number of goats and sheep are also significant: 2.3 and 2.6 million 
heads, respectively. Corn production in the Bahian semiarid (631 thousand tons in 2013) is mainly used 
for  animal  feed,  and  represented  29%  of  the  total  state  production  (less  than  1%  of  the  total  national 
production). 

 

Characteristics of small farms 

The associations between characteristics of small farmers and agricultural production are analyzed using 
data  of  the  Agricultural  Census  2006  of  IBGE.  The  Agricultural  Census  allows  us  to  consider  a  wide 
range of socioeconomic  characteristics of farms  as determinants  of the  agricultural  production. Thus, it 
allows  us  to  establish  the  relationship  between  the  production  and  characteristics  of  farms  and  the 
production system, such as the use of strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on agricultural 
production.  It  also  allows  a  specific  analysis  for  the  production  of  small  family  farms,  since  this 
classification  is  available  in  the  Agricultural  Census.  So,  despite  the  fact  that  the Census  allows only  a 
static  comparison  of  farm  production  under  different  climatic  conditions  (only  the  impacts  in  2006),  it 
allows us to evaluate the potential impacts of adaptive measures on agricultural production, such as use of 
mechanical technology, technical guidance and treatment of soil. 

The Agricultural Census contains data for the total population of farms in Brazil. In this analysis, we used 
the  information  of  family  farms  in  the  semiarid  region  of  Bahia,  which  represented  509,775 
establishments  in  2006.  Family  farms  were  classified  according  to  the  variable  "Family  Farm-  Law 
11326  of  07/24/2006."  In  addition  to  information  on  the  value  of  production,  analyses  also  consider 
characteristics  of  the  farmer,  such  as  education  and  membership  of  a  cooperative  or  agricultural 
association,  and  the  production  system,  such  as  the  use  of  technologies,  soil  treatment  and  technical 
guidance. The list of variables associated with the characteristics of the farms, farmers and the production 
systems are described in Table 2 and Table 3. All variables refer to the 2005-2006 harvest. 

Similarly to the analysis of the municipal production, five types of production were considered in these 
analyses, identified by the variables milk, cattle, goat, sheep and corn. Among the small family farmers, 
cattle  and  sheep  farming  also  prevail,  practiced  with  a  very  low  level  of  intensification.  The  average 
number of heads of cattle per farm was 6.6, and the average number of heads per hectare of pasture was 
only  0.8.  Similar  results  are  found  for  sheep  and  goat,  with  an  average  number  of  heads  per  farm 
respectively equal to 2.9 and 3.6 and average number of head per hectare equal to 0.4 in both cases. The 
average milk yield per family farm is 123 liters per year, which amounts an average yield of 1045 liters 
per cow (123 liters / 0.12 cows = 1045 liters / cow). This milk yield is higher than that estimated for the 
whole territory (Table 1), which considers all types of farms and is based on estimates for the municipal 
production, but it is still significantly below the national average per family farm (1556 liters / cow). In 
turn, the average corn production per family farm is 1.4 tons. 

The farm size (atotal) controls the physical capital. In the case of production of cattle, sheep, goats and 
milk,  five  types  of  land  use  are  considered:  natural  pasture  area  (anatpast),  degraded  pasture  area 
(adegpast),  non  degraded  pasture  area  (andegpast)  planted  area  of  forage  (aforage)  and  area  of  forest 
(aforest).  The  planted  area  of  corn  (acorn)  is  used  in  the  corn  production.  The  average  farm  size  is  14 
hectares, which is used predominantly for livestock farming. The pasture areas represent more than half 
the farm size: on average 3.4 hectares of non-degraded pasture, 0.9 of degraded pasture and 3.6 of natural 

 

5 

 
pasture. Areas of forage (especially palm) adds 0.4 hectare, on average, and forests (savanna) 4.5 more 
hectares. The average planted area with corn is 1.4 hectares.

The labor force is controlled by the variable lf, which corresponds to the sum of family labor (including 
managers)  and  hired  labor.  Proxies  for  social  capital  are:  membership  of  cooperative  (coop);  or 
membership  of  farm  association  (assoc).  Farms  have,  on  average,  roughly  2  workers,  and  only  1%  of 
them are members of cooperatives. Participation in farm associations is more usual: 42%.

education  (school11);  complete  technical  or  secondary  education  (school21);  and  complete  college 
education  (school31).  Results  highlight  that  farmers  are  relatively  elderly  by  Brazilian  standards,  since 
34% of farmers are 60 years old or more, and they present very low levels of education, since 40% of the 
farmers have no formal education.

The  use  of  technologies  is  analyzed  by  the  variables  atraction  (if  the  farm  uses  animal  traction)  and 
mtraction  (if  the  farm  uses  mechanical  traction).  The  variable  guidance  indicates  whether  the  farm 
received technical assistance by qualified professionals. The use of good agricultural practices considers: 
the fertilization of pastures and crops (fertilizep and fertilizec); the use of lime or other corrective of soil 
ph (soilcor); the use of fallows, rest or crop to recover pastures (fallow); and the use of pasture rotation 
(rotation). The use of animal or mechanical traction is low among family farms in the semiarid of Bahia: 
39%  used  animal  and  27%  used  mechanical  traction.  The  percentage  of  farms  that  received  some 
technical guidance in agricultural production is also remarkably low, only 5% in 2006. Technics of soil 
treatment  are also  rare:  3% applied lime or other correctives of soil pH,  2% fertilized their pasture and 
20%  fertilized  their  crops.  The  rest  of  pasture  is  practiced  by  only  14%  and  rotation  by  only  19%  of 
family farms.

The use of adaptive strategies for droughts in the farm is analyzed by the existence of cisterns (cistern), 
wells (well), natural  lake or weir (weir);  and control of diseases or parasites in  animals  (diseasec). The 
construction  of  cisterns  has  been  the  main  policy  to  fight  droughts  in  the  Brazilian  semiarid  region.  A 
quarter  of  family  farms  in  the  region  had  cisterns  in  2006.  Weirs  (or  natural  lakes)  are  also  relatively 
frequent, 15%. And the control of diseases or parasites in animals is practiced by almost half of family 
farms. 

Two variables defined by the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization) and INCRA (National Institute 
of Colonization and Agrarian Reform)  (Guanziroli 2001), helped to characterize the production  system: 
the degree of specialization and the degree of market integration. The degree of specialization, which is 
measured by the ratio between the production value of the main product and the total production value, is 
analyzed  by  3  categories:  highly  specialized  (specialized1),  with  a  degree  of  specialization  equal  to  1; 
specialized (specialized2), with a degree of specialization lower than 1 and greater than 0.65; diversified 
(specialized3),  with  a  degree  of  specialization  lower  than  0.65.  Almost  half  of  farms  did  not  have  a 
specific specialization in agricultural production. In other words, the value of the main product of these 
family farms did not represent more than 65% of total production value. 

In turn, the degree of market integration, which is measured by the ratio between the total revenue from 
agricultural  activity  and  the  total  value  of  agricultural  production  was  analyzed  by  the  3  categories: 
highly  integrated  (integrated1),  with  a  degree  of  integration  higher  than  0.9;  integrated  (integrated2), 
with  a  degree  of  integration  between  0.5  and  0.9;  poorly  integrated  (integrated3),  with  a  degree  of 
integration  between  zero  and  0.).  More  than  half  of  the  family  farms  were  poorly  integrated,  i.e.,  their 
revenues  from  agricultural  products  represented  less  than  50%  of  total  agricultural  production,  which 
reflects the prevalence of self-subsistence agriculture in the region. 

Finally, the access to credit is analyzed by the binary variable credit, which identifies whether the family 
farm  obtained  funding  from  PRONAF  (National  Program  to  Strengthen  Family  Farming),  which  is  the 
main  public  funding  program  for  small  family  farms  in  Brazil.  Although  the  percentage  of  farms 
receiving PRONAF in 2006 was substantially low (7%), it must be considered that this value refers only 
to loans contracted in 2006. Since the period of payment is up to 10 years, with up to 3-year grace period, 
the percentage of family farms assisted by PRONAF is probably much higher. 

 

3.2.Statistical analyses  

Climate clusters 

In order to  consider nonlinear  patterns of  relationship between  climate and agricultural  production, this 
study  defined  climatic  clusters  in  the  semiarid  of  Bahia.  The  variables  used  in  these  analyses  are  those 
presented  in  Table  1:  average  annual  temperature  (avgtemp),  maximum  temperature  (maxtemp), 
minimum  temperature  (mintemp),  relative  humidity  (humidity),  annual  precipitation  (precip),  total 
number of days in the year with preciption lower than 1 mm (norain). Each climatic cluster corresponds 
to  a  set  of  MCAs  with  relatively  homogeneous  values  for  the  selected  variables.  The  groups  consider 
climate  for  the  MCAs  in  each  year  of  analysis  (1974-2013).  This  means  that  there  were  206  (MCAs) 
observations for each year of analysis, making 6,592 observations in 32 years with valid observations in 
the period. Thus, a MCA may belong to a specific cluster in one year and to another cluster in other year. 

The classification of municipal observations in cluster was defined by the technique of Cluster Analysis 
(CA). The CA defines hierarchical  groups of observations within a data set.  There are several  methods 
that can be employed in this process,  but  all  are based on the same principle of hierarchical  clustering. 
Initially, each observation is a cluster. The two closest clusters are joined to form a new cluster, and so 
on,  until  the  method  forms  a  maximum  number  of  clusters  that  is  predetermined  according  to  the 
analytical  convenience.  The  difference  between  the  methods  is  basically  the  way  the  distance  (or 
dissimilarity)  between  the  clusters  is  calculated.  The  clustering  method  used  in  this  study  is  the  Ward 
method, an aggregation strategy based on the analysis of variance within and between the groups formed. 

8 

 

 
The aim of this method is to create hierarchical groups in such a way that the variance within the groups 
is minimal and the variances between the groups is maximal (Crivisqui 1999). The aggregation criterion 
consists  of  finding  the  next  group  which  minimizes  the  variability  within  the  newly-formed  group.  To 
facilitate  the  understanding  of  the  variability  within  the  groups,  they  are  usually  divided  by  the  total 
variance to represent a ratio of the maximum achieved variability (R2 semipartial). 

 

Panel data analysis of the municipal production  

The relationship between the dynamics of climate clusters and the agricultural production of MCAs was 
analyzed using panel data models. The analysis of panel data allows  us to evaluate more accurately the 
cause and effect relations between the dependent (Y) and independent (X) variables, since it allow us to 
control  unobserved  factors  associated  with  MCAs  (ci)  which  are  considered  constant  in  time.  The 
dependent  variable  of  each  model  is  represented  by  the  natural  logarithm  of  the  types  of  agricultural 
production. The logarithmic transformation aims to approximate to linearity the relationship between the 
dependent variable and covariates X. It also allows us to analyze the relative variation (%) in the type of 
production due to marginal variations in X. The relationship is given by: 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

Where ln Yij is the natural logarithm of the dependent variable (pmilk, cattle, goat, sheep and corn) and Xj 
is the j-th regressor of interest. Covariates were represented by the rural population in the MCA (prural) 
and binary variables discriminating the climate clusters obtained in the previous analysis. The coefficient 
α  is  the  intercept  and  βj  is  net  impact  of  Xj  on  ln  Y.  The  coefficient   refers  to  the  time  trend  of  the 
dependent variable and represents for example, factors associated with technological advances and other 
unobserved factors that are constant between the MCAs in time. The factor ci refers to unobserved factors 
that are associated with MCAs (human and social capital, or soil quality, for example). The variable  is 
the idiosyncratic error, uncontrolled factors that are not associated with municipalities and/or time. 

Although the factor ci is not be observed, it can be controlled by the fixed effects approach (Wooldridge 
2002).  The  fixed  effects  approach  considers  that  the  ci  factor  represents  a  population  parameter,  which 
can  be  controlled  through  binary  variables  (binary  variables  estimator)  or  through  algebraic 
transformations (within estimators).  In this work, we adopted the  within transformation, which, through 
algebraic transformations, excludes the factor  ci  from  the original specification (equation 1), preserving 
the  relationship  established  for  the  other  parameters  of  interest  (α, j  and ).  Estimators  were  obtained 
using the xtreg command from Stata software. 

 

Cross section analysis of the small farm production 

The potential impacts of the characteristics of farms and adaptive strategies on the production of family 
farming in the semiarid region of Bahia is based on models with cross-sectional data of the Agricultural 
Census 2006, sponsored by IBGE. The relationship between the variables is given by:

Where ln Yi is the natural logarithm of the production of family farming. The subscript i refers to the i-th 
family  farm.  The  set  of  dependent  and  independent  variables  (Xj)  is  presented  in  Table  2  and  Table  3. 
Coefficients  were  estimated  by  the  method  of  Ordinary  Least  Squares  (OLS)  using  PROC  REG 
procedure of SAS software. Standard error estimators are robust to heteroscedasticity and were obtained 
using ACOV option of PROC REG.

A model was adjusted for each type of  production, whose dependent variables are very similar to those 
used in previous analyses of panel data models: (i) total liters of milk (variable milk); (ii) head of cattle 
(cattle);  (iii)  head  of  sheep  (sheep);  (iv)  head  of  goat  (goat);  and  (v)  tons  of  corn  per  year  (corn).  The 
main difference in relation to the previous analysis refers to the dependent variable associated with milk 
production,  which  now  refers  to  the  total  production  in  liters  rather  than  the  yield  per  cow.  This 
modification  is  due  to  the  fact  that  this  model  showed  a  greater  explanatory  power  and  has  produced 
more  consistent  estimates  for  the  coefficients.  In  any  case,  the  analysis  of  production  efficiency, 
measured by the milk yield (liters/cow) is not compromised because the number of cows (cow) is used as 
a control variable. In other words, the coefficients of this model indicate a greater or lesser production of 
milk holding constant the number of cows, thus giving a measure of production efficiency.

4.1.Climate Clusters 

Initially,  CA  was  applied  to  identify  groups  of  obsevations  with  relatively  homogeneous  values  for  the 
variables:  average  temperature  (avgtemp),  maximum  temperature  (maxtemp),  minimum  temperature 
(mintemp),  relative  humidity  (humidity),  annual  precipitation  (precip)  days  in  the  year  with  the 
precipitation  lower  than  1  mm  (norain).  Each  observation  represents  a  MCA  in  a  specific  year.  Six 
clusters were initially selected, and the differences between the mean values of these clusters accounted 
for 91% of the total variability (R2 semipartial) observed between the annual values of MCAs. Since one 
of the clusters represented a rare climatic condition, observed for a low number of observations (462), it 
was incorporated into the cluster with closer characteristics to  permit a more significant analysis. Thus, 
analyses were based on 5 climatic clusters, with average characteristics presented in Table 4.

From the 1st to the 5th cluster, the climate conditions tend to be better, with lower average temperatures, 
and greater rainfall and humidity. Clusters 1 and 2 have the higher temperatures, lower relative humidity 
and  precipitation  and  larger  numbers  of  days  with  a  precipitation  lower  than  1  mm.  Cluster  1  presents 
more extreme conditions compared to cluster 2 with respect to precipitation, humidity and days without 
rain.  Clusters 3 and 4 represent  intermediate  climate  conditions  in  the region  and cluster 5 presents  the 
best climate indicators. For example, the average temperature in cluster 5 is 1.5 °C lower than in cluster 1 
and the annual precipitation is almost 3 times higher.

4.2.The impacts on agricultural production 

The analysis of the relationship between the dynamics of climate clusters and the agricultural production 
in  the  MCAs  is  based  on  the  estimates  of  model  for  unbalanced  panel  data  (Equation  1),  containing 
information for the 206 MCAs in the semiarid of Bahia between 1974 and 2013. The aim of this analysis 
is  to  understand  how  the  climate  clusters  positively  or  negatively  affect  each  type  of  agricultural 
production in the MCAs. Five models were adjusted, one for each type of agricultural production (i) liters 
of milk per cow (pmilk); (ii) head of cattle (cattle); (iii) head of goats (goat); (iv) head of sheep (sheep); 
(iv) tons of corn (corn). 

Among the independent variables Xj of the multiple regression model (equation 1), four binary variables 
were  used  to  assess  the  impacts  of  climate  clusters  on  agricultural  production.  For  example,  the  binary 
variable cluster1 assumes 1 when the MCA i belongs to the climate cluster 1 in year t. The same is true 
for  binary  cluster2,  cluster3  and  cluster4.  Cluster  5,  which  represents  the  best  climate  condition  in  the 
region, is used as reference of analysis. Thus, the coefficient βj indicates the average difference between 

the  climate  cluster  j  and  the  Cluster  5  (reference).  The  expression 
difference (percentage) between the clusters (Halvorsen and Palmquist 1980). 

  obtains  the  average  relative 

Two  other  binary  variables,  cluster1_2  and  cluster2_2,  were  also  considered  among  the  independent 
variables  in  order  to  evaluate  the  impacts  of  the  recurrence  of  extreme  climate  events.  These  binary 
assume  the  value  1  if  the  climate  groups  with  the  most  extreme  conditions,  clusters  1  and  2,  occur 
repeatedly in two consecutive years. For example, if the MCA is classified in the climate cluster 1 for two 
consecutive years (t and t1), the variable cluster1_1 assumes 1 in the year t. Thus, suppose that 1 is the 
coefficient  associated  with  the  binary  cluster1  and  1_2  the  coefficient  associated  with  the  binary 
cluster1_2. The mean difference of Y between clusters 1 and 5 will be equal to 1 + 1_2 when the MCA 
is classified in the cluster 1 for two consecutive years. That is, the relative difference between the  mean 

values  of  the  Y  between  clusters  1  and  5  will  be  given  by 
.  Similar  analysis  can  be  derived 
using  the  binary  variable  cluster2_2,  which  takes  1  when  the  MCA  is  classified  in  cluster  2  for  two 
consecutive years. 

The recurrence of clusters 1 and 2 for more than two consecutive years was tested, but  ignored because 
results were insignificant. Similarly, the recurrence of other climate groups (3 and 4) was also tested, but 
their effects were largely insignificant, and the variables were dropped to facilitate analysis. It should be 
noted  that  the  inclusion  of  lagged  values  of  covariates  (Xt1)  tends  to  generate  multicollinearity, 
increasing the standard errors of the estimators. 

The logarithm of the rural population was included among the independent variable as a proxy for labor 
supply  in  agriculture.  A  time  trend  was  also  incorporated  in  the  model,  which  was  controlled  by  the 
variable t with values ranging between 0 (for 1974) and 39 (for the year 2013). This variable identifies a 
common linear trend in the local production, which would be associated, for example, with technological 
or socio-economic development in the region. 

Table 5 exhibits the fixed effects estimates for the coefficients of equation (1). Each column refers to one 
of  the  dependent  variables.  Estimates  appear  in  the  first  line  of  each  regressor.  The  p  values  consider 
standard errors robust to the presence of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.  Table 5 also contains in 
its final  lines statistics of  goodness of fit. The total  number of observations used in  each estimation (n) 
differs between the models, since there is a distinct availability of data for each type of production. The 
statistics  R2  indicate  that  adjustments  have  explanatory  powers  ranging  between  3%  and  12%.  These 
coefficients  refer  exclusively  to  variability  within  the  MCAs,  i.e.,  they  do  not  account  the  variability 
between MCAs. All models showed significant statistics F, i.e., the models add significant contributions 
to explain each type of agricultural production. Although the values of R2 are relatively low, the relatively 
low  number  of  covariates  used  to  explain  a  long  history  of  extremely  heterogeneous  variations  of 
municipal  agricultural  production  must  be  highlighted.  Several  factors  that  affect  production  are  not 
considered, such as access to infrastructure, credit, human and social capital, since these variables are not 

11

available for the whole period of analysis. These variables are controlled by the fixed effects representing 
the municipal heterogeneities and the trend variable representing the temporal heterogeneity.

The estimates for the coefficients associated with the rural population highlights that cattle raising is the 
most sensitive to the population size. The expected number of head of cattle increases by 0.28% for each 
1%  increase  in  the  rural  population.  The  other  productions  showed  no  significant  relationship  with  the 
rural population, suggesting that cattle farming is the most labor intensive production in the semiarid of 
Bahia, albeit with a low elasticity. 

The coefficients  associated with each climate cluster indicate the relative differences between the mean 
production during the years in which the MCA is classified in a respective climate cluster and the years in 
which  the  same  MCA  is  classified  in  the  reference  group  (cluster  5).  For  example,  the  estimate  for  the 
coefficient  associated  with  the  cluster  1  (variable  cluster1)  for  the  milk  yield  suggests  that  holding 
constant  other factors, the milk  yield  in  the  years in  which the MCA is classified in  the  cluster  1 is on 

average 8.1% lower (
) than that observed in the years in which the MCA is classified in cluster 
5.  The  occurrence  of  climate  conditions  similar  to  that  of  clusters  2  and  3  also  negatively  impacts  the 
milk yield in MCA, when compared to the yield in the climate cluster 5. The mean  yield in cluster 2 is 

3.1% lower (

) than in cluster 5 and it is 3.0% lower (

) in cluster 3. 

Although the impact of the second most extreme climate event (cluster 2) is lower than that of the most 
extreme  event  (cluster  1),  the  effects  of  cluster  2  are  boosted  when  the  MCA  is  classified  for  two 
consecutive years in this category. In these years (MCA classified in cluster 2 for two consecutive years), 

) that that in the years in which the MCA is classified in 
the mean milk yield is 6.7% lower (
cluster 5. Thus, while the main impact of more extreme climate event (cluster 1) in milk yield is of short-
term, the impact of cluster 2 is of medium-term, i.e., with the recurrence of the climate phenomenon for 
two consecutive years in the same locality. 

The most significant impact of climate change on the number of head of cattle occurs with the recurrence 
of extreme events, particularly the classification of the MCA in the climate cluster 1 for two consecutive 

 

12 

1084,0e1031,0e1031,0e1038,0031,0e 

years.  In  such  years,  the  number  of  head  of  cattle  is  on  average  10.2%  lower  (
)  than  in 
cluster 5. The recurrence of extreme weather events also tends to cause significant impacts on the head of 
sheep and goats. When the MCA is classified in cluster 2 for two consecutive years, the number of head 

of  goats  is  on  average  7.7%  lower  (

)  than  that  of  the  years  in  which  this  same  locality  is 

classified  in  the  climate  cluster  5.  The  value  is  7.9%  lower  (
sheep. 

)  for  the  number  of  head  of 

Among  the  types  of  agricultural  production  analyzed,  the  corn  production  is  undoubtedly  the  most 
affected  by  climate  change  in  the  semiarid  of  Bahia.  In  years  when  the  MCA  is  classified  in  the  three 
hottest and driest climatic clusters (clusters 1, 2 and 3), the average corn production is substantially lower 
than in the years when the same locality is classified in cluster 5. For example, compared to the years in 

which the  MCA is classified  in  cluster 5, corn production is  on average 72.7% lower (

) when 

the  climate  conditions  in  the  MCA  is  equivalent  to  the  cluster  1;  46.6%  lower  (

)  when  such 

conditions are equivalent to that of cluster 2; and 21.6% lower (
) when the MCA is classified in 
cluster 3. The impacts in corn production are of short- term, i.e., it occurs in the same year as the climate 
event,  since  the  recurrence  of  the  most  extreme  events  (clusters  1  and  2)  has  shown  an  insignificant 
impact on corn production. 

Finally, the coefficients associated with the variable t indicate trends for each type of production in time, 
assuming  constant  the  climate  conditions  and  the  dynamics  of  the  rural  population  (control  variables). 
The  trends  for  the  milk  yield  and  the  cattle  farming  are  not  relevant.  In  turn,  the  trends  for  sheep  and 

especially  goats  present  the  most  substantial  growth:  1.1%  per  year  (

)  for  sheep  and  2.4%  per 

year (

year (

 

) for  goats.  In turn, corn production  fell in  the period,  with  a negative trend of 4.9% per 

). 

4.3.Adaptative strategies for small farms production 

The potential impacts of the farms’ characteristics on the production of family farming in the semiarid of 
Bahia  are  estimated  by  multiple  linear  regression  models  fitted  to  the  2006  Agricultural  Census  data 
(Equation  2).  A  model  for  each  production  type  was  adjusted,  with  some  adaptations  in  the  dependent 
variable compared to the previous analyses: (I) total liters of milk (variable milk); (ii) cattle herd (cattle); 
(iii) sheep herd (sheep); (iv) goats (goat); and (v) corn production (corn). The natural logarithm was also 
applied  to  all  the  dependent  variables  to  obtain  a  linear  relationship  between  the  variables.  The  main 
difference  from  the  previous  analysis  refers  to  the  dependent  variable  associated  with  milk  production, 
which now refers to the total milk production in liters (and not to the production per cow). The reason is 
that  this  model  has  shown  a  greater  explanatory  power  of  the  dependent  variable  and  presented  more 
accurate  estimates  for  the  model  coefficients,  besides  a  greater  explanatory  power.  In  any  case,  the 
analysis  of  productive  efficiency,  measured  by  the  milk  productivity  (liters  /  cow)  is  not  compromised 
because the number of cows (cows) was used as a control variable. In other words, the coefficients of this 
model indicate a higher or lower impact on milk production while keeping constant the number of cows, 
thus giving a measure of production efficiency. 

The set of independent variables used as determinant and control of production are presented in Table 6 
(producers’  and  farms’  characteristics)  and  Table  7  (production  systems’  characteristics).  The  climate 
conditions were controlled by four binary representing the MCAs classification in 2006, according to the 
methodology  explained  in  Part  2:  cluster1,  cluster2,  cluster3,  cluster4.  The  climate  cluster  5  is  used  as 
reference  for  the  analysis.  Unlike  previous  analyses  with  panel  data  (Equation  1),  the  analysis  of  the 
equation  2  does  not  necessarily  establish  a  cause  and  effect  relationship  between  the  independent 
variables  and  the  agricultural  production.  This  is  because  climate  clusters  tend  to  be  correlated  with 
unobserved factors in  the territory, which also  determine the production, such as the adaptability of the 
producer to regional conditions. Nevertheless, the most important result of these cross-sectional models is

to  allow  the  assessment  of  the  conditional  association  between  adaptation  strategies  and  agricultural 
production.  However,  these  analyses  should  also  be  performed  with  caution  because  a  conditional 
association relationship does not necessarily mean a cause-effect relationship.

The  estimates  for  each  type  of  production  are  presented  in  Tables  Table  6  (characteristics  of  the  farms 
and  of  the  farmers)  and  Table  7  (characteristics  of  the  production  system).  All  the  adjustments  were 
significant,  that  is,  with  at  least  one  estimate  statistically  different  from  zero  (F  statistics).  The 
coefficients  of  determination  of  the  adjusted  models  (R2)  vary  between  21%  (sheep)  and  88%  (corn), 
highlighting reasonable goodness of fit measures.  

As  expected,  the  farm  area,  used  as  proxy  of  physical  capital,  tends  to  have  significant  and  positive 
association with the production. The marginal effect tends to be larger to the area with forage cultivation. 
For  example,  for  each  1%  increase  of  the  forage  cultivation  in  the  farm’s  total  area,  one  expects  an 
increase  of  0.13%  in  the  milk  production,  keeping  constant  the  other  variables.  Cattle  is  particularly 

14 

 

 
influenced by the area with non-degraded grazing (elasticity of 0.16%), while goats and sheeps are less 
influenced  by  the  grazing  areas,  probably  because  of  their  ease  in  adapting  to  different  environmental 
conditions.  The livestock appear to  depend mostly on forage  areas.  In turn, corn is  extremely elastic to 
cultivated area: for each 1% variation in the area, a variation of 2.1% in the production is expected. This 
is an expected result, since corn production in these areas employs very low levels of technology and lis 
strongly correlated with the total cultivated area.  

On  the  other  hand,  the  total  workers  in  the  agricultural  activity  have  little  impact  on  production  since 
other  factors  are  controlled.  For  example,  for  each  additional  worker,  a  variation  of  only  1.6%  in  the 
cattle  production  is  expected,  keeping  constant  the  other  production  factors.  These  results  should  be 
analyzed with caution, though they initially suggest that the production of family farming in the semi-arid 
of Bahia is inelastic to the use of labor, since it would be associated with very small-scale production. 

The  association  of  cooperativism  with  livestock production  is  positive  and  significant,  but  insignificant 
with the cultivation of corn and negative with milk production. The average production of the cooperative 
farms is 6.9% higher (e0.0661) than that of non-cooperative farms for cattle production, 5.1% (e0.0491) 
for  the  sheep  production  and  3.0%  superior  (e0.0291)  for  the  goat  production,  ceteris  paribus.  The 
negative association of cooperativism with the milk production would probably relate to the lower scale 
of  the  family  agricultural  production  associated  to  the  local  cooperatives.  The  most  productive  milk 
producers  tend  to  be  those  associated  with  the  agriculture  association  membership:  production  is  on 
average  8.9%  higher  (e0.0861)  than  those  of  non-associated.  Similarly,  sheep  and  goat  production  also 
tends to be higher for producers associated with the agriculture association membership: 3.3% (e0.0331) 
and 5.5% (e0.0541), respectively. 

Farms  run  by  women  predictably  present  a  lower  livestock  production  than  men’s  due  to  the  need  for 
heavy manual work. Such a lower average production value may be also associated, for example, with the 
absence of a partner to share the livestock activities, which usually demand intense physical effort. The 
production  is  14,1%  lower  (e0.1521)  for  the  cattle.  In  the  corn  production,  farms  managed  by  women 
tend to present a bigger production (7,4% higher on average), which probably would be associated with a 
greater allocation to agricultural practice. 

The milk and cattle production tend to be greater for those farms managed by older people. For example, 
the number of cattle on  the farms managed by  over 60-year olds are on  average 27% higher  (e0,23911) 
than that of those farms managed by people up to 29 years old. The acquisition of cattle, particularly of 
selected species, requires capital accumulation that may be not be easily  accessible to  younger farmers. 
Farms  run  by  younger  people  tend  to  be  associated  with  the  production  of  goat,  sheep  and  especially 
corn, which require lower initial capital. 

Education  is  another  important  factor  in  explaining  all  types  of  production.  The  higher  the  educational 
level, the greater will be the production of cattle and lower the production of other agricultural activities 
(milk,  goats,  sheep  and  corn).  Farmers  that  can  only  read  and  write  (variable  escola01)  present,  for 
example,  a  production  of  cattle  that  is  7.8%  (e0,0751)  higher  than  that  of  farmers  with  no  education. 
Production grows more intensively if the farmer has fundamental education or more (variables escola11, 
escola21  and  escola31).  For  example,  production  is  on  average  23%  higher  (e0,2071)  if  the  farmer  has 
finished  university  education  (compared  to  the  production  of  those  with  no  education).  In  turn,  the 
strongest negative association was observed for the production of milk, suggesting a strong specialization 
of production among those more educated (cattle) and less educated (milk). 

The  use  of  animal  traction  is  positively  associated  with  milk  and  cattle  production,  while  the  use  of 
mechanical traction is positively associated with milk and corn production. The mean production of milk, 
for example, is 21.8% (e0,1971) higher on farms with mechanical traction, holding constant other factors. 
In  turn,  the  number  of  head  of  sheep  and  goats  is  negatively  associated  with  the  use  of  animal  and 
mechanical traction, suggesting that these types of production prevail in fams employing lower levels of 
technology.

Family  farms  receiving  technical  guidance  present  a  production  of  goats  and  sheep  that  is  expressively 
higher than others: 24.6% for goats (e0,2201) and 19.7% for sheep (e0,2251). This result may reflect the 
efforts  of local  agencies of agricultural  extension in  disseminating the raising of goats  and sheep  in  the 
region, species that would be more adapted to the climate conditions of the semiarid. For other activities, 
the differences are negligible. 

The effect of fertilizer is positive and significant for most types of production, with the exception of cattle 
farming.  For  example,  farmers  that  fertilize  pastures  present  a  mean  milk  production  that  is  27% 
(e0,2391) higher than others, irrespective of other control factors. Similar net effects are observed in the 
goat  and sheep farming.  The corn production  is  on average 37.2% higher  (e0,3171) for producers  using 
fertilization. In turn, the use of lime or other types of correction of soil pH is negatively associated with 
all types of agricultural  production.  These results indicate that the correction of soil pH would be more 
common in other agricultural activities in the state. 

Pasture  rotation  is  positively  and  significantly  associated  with  milk  production  and  cattle  farming. 
Farmers who perform pasture rotation have a mean milk production 74.3% higher (e0,5561) than others, 
and a mean number of head of cattle 61.9% (e0,4821) higher. In turn, the fallow, resting or strategies to 
cultive crops for pasture recovery only has a positive association with the cultivation of corn, a crop that 
may  be  being  used  in  crop-livestock  integration.  Nonetheless,  this  result  reflects  only  the  short-term 

16 

 

 
impacts  on  livestock.  There  is  no  information  available  to  evaluate  the  impacts  on  the  total  value  of 
production and or the sustainability of the system in the long term. 

Among the production techniques under analysis, the control of diseases and pests in animals is the one 
with  the  largest  partial  effects  on  livestock  farming.  Farmers  who  perform  this  type  of  control  have  a 
mean number of head of cattle that is more than twice as high as others (e0,8421 = 132.2%). The impact 
is  lower  in  the  case  of  goat  farming  (e0,2111),  suggesting  that  this  species  is  more  resistant  to  diseases 
and parasites that occur in the region. 

Common  adaptive  strategies  in  the  region,  such  as  the  use  of  wells,  tanks  and  cisterns,  have  different 
effects  on agricultural  production. The partial effect  of wells is  higher in  the cattle farming:  production 
11.9% higher (e0,1121) for those with wells. The use of lakes and weirs is also positively associated with 
cattle  farming  -  production  that  is  15.9%  higher  (e0,1471)  -  sheep  farming  -  production  16,0%  higher 
(e0,1491). In turn, the use of cisterns is more associated with goat and sheep farming: the production of 
goats is on average 23.2% higher (e0,2081) in farms with weirs and the sheep production is on average 
31.8% higher (e0,2761). 

Specializing in  few agricultural  products  does not  have a unidirectional  effect  on all types of activities. 
The high specialization has a positive effect only on cattle farming. Even so, the partial effect is not very 
substantial. Highly specialized farms, that is, where the value of the agricultural production comes almost 
exclusively from the cattle farming, present a production that is  on average 5.5%  (e0,0531) higher  than 
diversified farmers, irrespective of other characteristics. In turn, specialization in the production of milk, 
with some diversification into other agricultural activities, shows relevant positive results: the production 
is  on  average  28.3%  higher  (e0,2491)  than  diversified  farmers.  Moreover,  the  results  of  specialization, 
especially high specialization, is  significantly negative for the production of  goats,  sheep and  corn. For 
example, the average production of goats from highly specialized farmers is 9.5% lower (e0,0991) than 
that  of  diversified  farmers.  These  results  may  suggest  that  the  integration  of  an  agricultural  crop  with 
sheep and goat farming would have a positive impact on these activities. 

In turn, the degree of integration with the market, i.e., the share of the total agricultural production that is 
commercialized  in  the  market,  has  a  positive  and  significant  impact  on  most  types  of  production.  The 
impacts  of  the  high  integration,  in  which  virtually  all  agricultural  production  is  sold  in  the  market,  is 
positive and significant, especially in the case of cattle and sheep farming. Highly integrated farms have a 
cattle  production  that  is  on  average  21.5%  higher  (e0,1951)  than  poorly  integrated  farms,  and  a  sheep 
production that is on average 22.9% higher (e0,2061). The effects are more relevant when there is more 
interaction  between  the  production  for  sale  and  the  production  for  self-consumption  or  animal  feed.  In 
integrated  farms,  where  the  ratio  between  the  agricultural  production  and  the  revenue  from  agricultural 
production is between 0.5 and 0.9, the milk production, for example, is 24% higher (e0,2151) that that of 
highly integrated farms. 

The access  to  agricultural  credit (PRONAF) is  positively  related to  milk  production and cattle farming. 
For example, farmers who received PRONAF in 2006 showed an average milk production 16.2% higher 
(e0,1501)  than  those  who  did  not.  In  turn,  the  access  to  PRONAF  is  negatively  associated  with  the 
production  of  goats,  sheep  and  corn,  once  other  factors  are  controlled.  These  results  would  reflect  the 
greater allocation of public credit resources to the livestock industry in the region. 

Finally, climate variables identify associations between the climate conditions that farmers are submitted 
to and their agricultural production. The most relevant trends indicate a positive association between the 
production  of  sheep  and  goats  to  the  most  extreme  climate  groups  (clusters  1,  2  and  3),  as  well  as  a 
negative association between cattle farming and milk production with the hottest and driest groups. That 
is, farms would naturally shift from cattle farming to raising goats and sheep since the climate conditions 
of the territory are getting worse.

5.  Concluding remarks and policy implications 

The  climate  changes  observed  in  the  semiarid  of  Bahia  in  the  last  40  years  are  relevant.  The  average 
temperature  has  grown  at  a  rate  of  0.27oC  per  decade,  and  the  maximum  temperature  shifted  from  an 
average of 28.7oC in the 1970s to 30.2oC in the 2010s. At the same time, the number of days without rain 
over  the  year  has  increased  (from  an  average  of  251  in  the  1970s  to  275  in  the  2010s),  and  total 
precipitation has reduced (from 923 mm to 667 mm). Short cycles of more extreme conditions were also 
witnessed in the second half of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, as well as a longer cycle in the 
2000s. 

In parallel with these climate changes, there is an accelerated abandonment of the rural areas and major 
structural breaks in the agricultural production. Recent climate changes in the semiarid of Bahia, such as 
the  growth  of  average  temperature  and  reduction  of  rainfall,  are  likely  to  cause  significant  adverse 
impacts on all types of production (milk, cattle, sheep, goats and corn). The impacts are more significant 
in  the  production  of  corn  and  these  impacts  are  in  short-term.  The  losses  in  milk  production  are  also 
significant, and tend to worsen with the recurrence of extreme events. In livestock farming, the impacts 
are  greater  with  the  recurrence  of  extreme  events,  after  which  most  of  the  producers  tend  to  sell  their 
livestock. 

It  must  be  highlighted  that  these  results  are  based  on  the  estimates  of  average  impacts  of  different 
climatic groups on the municipal farming production over the period of analysis. The climate groups used 
in  this  study  to  estimate  these  impacts  only  summarize  the  main  climate  patterns,  and  are  not  able  to 
represent  the  complexity  of  climatic  phenomena  that  occur  in  the  region.  Periods  of  exceptionally 
atypical conditions can cause even more substantial losses in production, as observed in 1995 and 1996. 
Moreover, extreme situations that are recurrent tend undoubtedly to aggravate the scenario of production 
losses.  Although  the  impacts  of  two  consecutive  years  of  extreme  events  have  been  tested,  it  must  be 
considered  that  the  statistical  analysis  with  many  lagged  values  of  climate  variables  tends  to  present 
insignificant estimates due to the strong relationship among the independent variables (multicollinearity). 

Another  limitation  of  this  analysis  is  that  it  only  considers  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  the  whole 
agricultural  production  of  a  spatial  locality.  Unfortunately,  there  is  no  historical  information 
disaggregated  for  the  different  types  of  farmers.  In  other  words,  these  estimates  are  probably 
conservative, which means they underestimate the real impact on family farming production. The impactc 
would  probably  be  greater  among  smallholder  farmers,  since  they  are  usually  subjected  to  the  most 
vulnerable socioeconomic and productive conditions. Unfortunatelly, this factor could not be taken into 
consideration due to the unavailability of data. 

This  scenario  of  production  losses  is  extremely  troublesome  in  places  which  already  face  extremely 
vulnerable productive  and socioeconomic  conditions. Besides the climate conditions, the characteristics 
of farms, farmers and their production systems reinforce the low agricultural productivity in the semiarid 
of Bahia. Family farmers are largely unable to read or write, are of an advanced age, do not participate in 
cooperatives  and  employ  few  technological  resources.  Governmental  policies  to  promote  agricultural 
activity had a very limited range in 2006, since the percentage of producers receiving technical guidance 
for the production or even credit-oriented to family farming was very low. 

The production of milk and cattle requires high initial investment and tends to be larger on farms run by 
older  people.  There  is  also  a  strong  specialization  of  production  in  cattle  among  those  with  higher 
education, and of production of milk among those with less education. The association with cooperatives 
tends  to  generate  more  positive  effects  on  livestock  production  (cattle,  goats  and  sheep),  while  the 
association with farming associations tend to be more positive for the milk production. 

Agricultural  production  also  depends substantially  on the  characteristics of the  production system, such 
as mechanization, technical  guidance, soil treatment, access to credit and integration with the consumer 
market. Animal traction is associated with higher milk and beef production, while mechanical traction is 
associated with the highest production of milk and corn. Family farmers who receive technical guidance

have a production of goats and sheep markedly superior to the others, which is probably associated with 
the  efforts  of  local  agencies  of  agricultural  extension  in  disseminating  these  activities  in  the  region. 
Fertilization tends to  generate positive and significant results in virtually all types of activity, while the 
pasture rotation generates positive and substantial effects on milk production and cattle farming. 

The control of diseases and parasites in animals also appears to be a key strategy for increasing livestock 
production. Rural credit in the region is strongly directed to the production of cattle and milk. Among the 
most widespread strategies of adaptation to drought in the region, cisterns can bring positive results to the 
sheep  and  goat  farming,  while  the  use  of  lakes  and  weirs  would  be  more  positive  for  cattle  and  sheep 
farming. 

The  positive  impacts  of  some  characteristics  on  agricultural  production  provide  important  elements  to 
address adaptive measures to the negative impacts of climate changes. Albeit still limited in the region, 
institutional  policies  aimed  to  promote  access  to  education,  credit  and  technical  guidance  showed 
significantly positive impacts on different types of production and should be prioritized, as well measures 
to increase the technification of the production system or even the integration of family farmers in supply 
chains in the region. 

In this sense, local, state and federal government institutions  need to introduce new resilience measures 
that are economically efficient. Among the main strengthening links in climate resilience, the following 
are  suggested:  (i)  a  productive  climate  resilience  reference  system;  (ii)  credit  oriented  to  finance  this 
system; (iii) technical assistance for its implementation; (iv) strengthening of cooperative institutions; (v) 
agro-industrialization of products to add value, and (vi) improving access to markets.
