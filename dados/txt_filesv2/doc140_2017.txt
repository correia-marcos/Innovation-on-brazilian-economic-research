1. Introduction 
 

The electric power market is key to the growth and development of any economy. One 
of the most important issues in this area is to understand how the demand for residential energy 
changes when both the price of electricity and the income of consumers are varying (Dilaver 
and  Hunt,  2011;  Chang  et  al.,  2014).  The  correct  identification  of  the  demand  function 
parameters  for  residential  energy  consumption  is  relevant  for  the  provision  of  estimates  of 
future demand. An accurate estimation of price and income elasticities for residential electrical 
consumption serve as valuable inputs for policymakers and for electric companies in terms of 
investments  in  infrastructure,  energy  production,  distribution  structure,  and  profitability 
analysis (Medlock III and Soligo, 2001; Silk and Joutz, 1997; Beenstock et al., 1999; Chang et 
al., 2009; Nakajima and Hamori, 2010; Labandeira et al., 2017). 

Although there are many publications regarding the energy sector in Brazil, there are 
few studies that estimate the price and income elasticities for the residential urban sector and 
even fewer that use some level of disaggregated data. This paper fills a gap in the literature on 
residential  energy  consumption  in  Brazil.  We  are  the  first  to  empirically  estimate  price  and 
income  elasticities  for  residential  electricity  consumption  using  disaggregated  data  at  the 
household  level.  Household  level  data  is  more  informative  because  we  can  monitor  the 
consumers in different periods of time using a panel structure. It also allows us to control for 
household  and  family  characteristics  that  might  affect  energy  consumption,  seasonality,  and 
other unobservable characteristics by using fixed effects. 

 We use data from the Pesquisa de Orçamento Familiar (POF, or Household Budget 
Survey)  which  is  conducted  by  the  Fundação  Instituto  de  Pesquisa  Econômica  (FIPE,  or 
Economic Research Institute Foundation). The data collected by the POF survey is not entirely 
open to the public because it contains private information regarding the interviewed families.  
We  had  access  to  the  complete  sample  and  could  obtain  information  about  the  household’s 
energy  consumption,  family  income,  property  details,  among  other  variables.  The  sample 
covers  residences  in  the  metropolitan  area  of  São  Paulo  and  was  available  at  two  different 
periods,  1998-99  (POF98)  and  2008-13  (POF08),  which  enabled  us  to  adopt  panel  data 
estimation  procedures  and  to  control  for  a  variety  of  fixed  effects.  In  general  terms,  the 
estimated price elasticities range from  -0.46 to  -0.56, and the income elasticities range from 
0.20 to 0.32. Therefore, our main contribution to empirical research is an accurate estimation 

of  price  and  income  elasticities  for  the  residential  electrical  consumption  for  the  São  Paulo 
metropolitan area. 

The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  The  next  section  provides  an 
overview  of  the  residential  electrical  energy  market  in  Brazil,  followed  by  a  brief  empirical 
literature review in Section 3. Subsequently, in Section 4, the model specification and data are 
presented  and  discussed.  Next,  we  present  the  empirical  results  with  a  robustness  checks 
section. Finally, conclusions and political implications are discussed in section 6. 
 
2. Production, distribution, price policies and residential energy consumption in Brazil 
 
 According  to  the  Brazilian  Energy  Balance  (MME,  2016),  electricity  generation  in  Brazil 
comes  mainly  from  hydropower,  corresponding  to  64%  of  the  domestic  electricity  supply. 
Other main sources are natural gas (12.9%), biomass (8%), oil sub-products, coal, and coal sub-
products (9.3%). The Wind, solar and nuclear sources account for the remaining 5,91%. Public 
service  plants  are  the  largest  producers,  generating  83%  of  total  capacity.  Electricity 
consumption and generation have been growing since the 1970s, experiencing short periods of 
decline  (as  in  the  energy  crises  of  2001).  The  residential  use  of  firewood  and  other  indoor 
polluting  energy  sources  have  declined  with  the  expansion  of  the  electric  system  to  rural 
locations. The Federal program Luz Para Todos (Light for All), launched in 2003, is the most 
famous initiative and aimed at bringing access to electricity, free of charge, to more than 10 
million rural people living in vulnerable conditions (WEO, 2013). Besides these expansion and 
inclusion policies, the residential sector has experienced growth rates of 4.9% a year (from 2003 
to 2012) mainly due to easy credit conditions for consumers with reflections over the sales of 
home electrical  appliances (Villareal  and Moreira, 2016;  Achão and Schaeffer, 2009; WEO, 
2013). In 2015 the residential electric consumption corresponded to 25% of the total market,  
the industrial sector is the main consumer, with 37.6% (MME, 2016). Although expected to 
continue growing in  the  upcoming  years, when compared to  developed countries, electricity 
consumption in Brazil is still very small (Villareal and Moreira, 2016). 
 
With regards to household electricity prices, the majority of consumers face flat rates, 
that is, retail prices are fixed and defined by ANEEL (National Agency for Electric Energy). 
Created in 1997, ANEEL is  responsible for regulating and supervising the power sector and 
energy prices and for boosting efficiency advances in the generation and distribution of energy 
(WEO,  2013;  ANEEL,  2008).  The  main  players  in  the  sector  are  the  energy  generating 
companies, that produce the energy; the transmission companies, responsible for transporting 
energy from the point of generation to the consumer centers; and the distribution companies, 
which take energy to the home of the consumer. The costs of generation (31.33%), transmission 
(6.25%)  and  distribution  (28.98%)  are  included  in  the  final  consumer's  bill,  plus  taxes  and 
charges at different levels of government (33.45%)1. Energy tariffs for the electric sector are 
revised every 4-5 years (obeying regulatory periods for concessions' contracts) to establish a 
new  plateau  for  prices  and  are  also  adjusted  annually  in  accordance  with  inflation  rates  and 
other distribution costs (Corton et al., 2016; ANEEL, 2008). Following these rules, from 2003 
to 2007, residential electricity prices had a real increase of 32% (ANEEL, 2008). 
 
Until 1993, energy prices were uniform for the entire territory. Federal Law 8.631 ended 
this model and the tariff became fixed by concession area: a geographic territory where each 
distribution  company  is  contractually  obliged  to  supply  electricity,  which  may  or  may  not 
coincide with the limits of the federative units (a single state can have more than one concession 
area and, therefore, more than one energy tariff). Thus, according to ANEEL (2008), energy 
tariffs reflect the peculiarities of each region, such as the number of consumers, the size of the

consumer  market  or  the  distribution  network,  state  and  local  taxes,  among  other  factors. 
Additionally,  in  Brazil,  the  electricity  tariff  is  calculated  according  to  consumption  classes: 
residential;  industrial;  commercial  and  services;  rural;  public  power;  street  lighting;  public 
service,  and  own  consumption.  Each  class  has  a  distinct  tariff  structure,  according  to  the 
peculiarities of energy consumption and power demand.  

Regarding residential consumers, energy prices vary according to the type of residential 
connection:  whether  in  single-phase,  two-phase  or  three-phase  circuits.  There  are  also  low 
income  and  indigenous  groups  that  receive  substantial  energy  subsidies.  The  Social  Energy 
Tariff was created in 2002 by the Federal Law 10.438 and it is intended to give a discount to 
the  energy  bill  of  low-income  consumers  in  different  categories  of  consumption  with  the 
objective of expanding and democratizing the access to electricity. Federal Law 12.212/2010 
and  Decree  7.583/2011,  defined  the  socio-economic  criteria2  for  receiving  the  benefit  and 
stipulated the discounts3. Prior to that, ANEEL was the responsible for the direct regulation of 
the abatement4.  
 
3. Brief empirical literature review 
 
 
Several international studies seek to estimate the price and income elasticities for the 
residential electricity consumption. However, the literature for Brazil is still relatively scarce 
(Uhr et al., 2017). In this section, we present a short review of the empirical studies for the field. 
 
3.1 International literature 
 
 
The international empirical literature is rich, mainly at the country level (e.g., Table 1) 
but also for regional applications (Zhang et al., 2017; Gomez et al., 2013; Hosoe and Akiyama, 
2009).

Table 1 presents selected empirical studies that seek to identify the price and/or income 
elasticities for household electricity demand, for the short and long terms or both. Calculated 
elasticities are shown at the end of the table. It should be noted that the identification of price 
elasticities receives more attention in the literature than the estimation of income elasticities. 
Table 1 also depicts data location, the period of analysis, and employed methodology for each 
selected study. 
 
3.2 Brazilian literature 
 

 
Although there are many publications regarding the energy sector in Brazil5, there are 
few studies that estimate price and income elasticities for residential electricity consumption 
and  even  fewer  use  some  level  of  disaggregated  data.  Table  2  presents  a  summary  of  the 
empirical studies published in Brazil that estimate such elasticities.

Uhr  et  al.  (2017)  is  the  only  study  with  some  level  of  disaggregation.  The  authors 
estimate short-term  and  long-term price  and income elasticities for the  residential  electricity 
consumption using data for the Brazilian states with a panel structure and a Difference GMM 
approach (Arellano and Bond, 1991). They estimate seven models incorporating different sets 
of control variables and find short-term price elasticities varying between 0.13% to -0.18% and 
the long-term price elasticity ranging between -0.617% to -1.472%. The short-term estimates 
for the income-elasticity range between 0.08% and 0.12%, and long-run coefficients between 
0.324% to 1.095%.   

All the remaining studies are based on time series analysis and aggregated data for Brazil 
or for specific regions mainly because of “data availability” issues (Villareal and Moreira, 2016; 
Viana and Silva, 2014; Irffi et al., 2009; Siqueira et al., 2006; Mattos and Lima, 2005; Schmidt 
and  Lima,  2004;  Andrade  and  Lobão,  1997;  Modiano,  1984).  Some  estimate  only  long-run 
elasticities and only Villareal and Moreira (2016) work with recent data.

energy requirements and electricity end-uses, structural changes in electricity consumption, consumption by 
income classes and in different regions, determinants of electricity use, rural electrification, production and 
distribution costs, energy crisis in 2001, and other related subjects.   

4. Model Specification and Data 
 
4.1. Model 
 
 
 

Consider the Cobb-Douglas demand function with the following form: 

𝐶𝑖𝑡 = 𝐴𝑖𝑡(𝑃𝑖𝑡)𝛼1(𝐼𝑖𝑡)𝛼2𝑒 𝑋𝑖𝑡𝜹   

 

 

 

(1) 

 

In equation (1) the subscript  i represents the individual and the subscript  t represents 
different time periods.  𝐶𝑖𝑡 is the demand for residential energy, 𝑃𝑖𝑡 is the price of electricity 
(energy tariff),   𝐼𝑖𝑡 is  the real  income, and  𝑋𝑖𝑡 is  a vector of control variables that affect  the 
energy consumption. Taking the natural logarithm of equation (1), we have: 
 

𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑖𝑡 = lnA𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼1𝑙𝑛𝑃𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼2𝑙𝑛𝐼𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡𝛿 

 

 

 

(2) 

 

Replacing lnA𝑖𝑡 by the terms (𝜇𝑖 + 𝜃𝑡) and adding a stochastic error term 𝑢𝑖𝑡 in equation 

(2), we come to the following econometric specification: 
 

𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑖𝑡 = 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜃𝑡 + 𝛼1𝑙𝑛𝑃𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼2𝑙𝑛𝐼𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡𝛿 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡   

 

    (3) 

 

Equation (3) requires a panel data approach to control the fixed effects relative to the 
characteristics of the consumer that are constant over time (𝜇𝑖). It should be noted, however, 
that  the  residential  consumer  might  have  his  electricity  consumption  level  associated  with 
household structural characteristics (h) and/or family characteristics (f). In addition, the weather 
might have seasonal/monthly effects (m) on the energy bill, as might specific years (y), e.g., 
during summer or a year with abnormally high temperatures. Therefore, our empirical strategy 
follows the following equation: 

 

𝑙𝑛𝐶ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦 = 𝜇ℎ + 𝜋𝑓 + 𝜔𝑚 + 𝜃𝑦 + 𝛼1𝑙𝑛𝑃ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦 + 𝛼2𝑙𝑛𝐼ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦 + 𝑋ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦𝛿 + 𝑢ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦  (4) 

 
Terms  𝜇ℎ,  𝜋𝑓,  𝜔𝑚,  𝜃𝑡  are  the  mentioned  fixed  effects.  The  subscripts  h,  f,  m,  and  t, 
 
represent, respectively, the same household, the same family observed in the two different time 
periods  of  the  sample  (1998-99  and  2008-13),  the  month  of  observation,  and  year  of 
observation. The dependent variable, 𝑙𝑛𝐶ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑡, is the residential energy consumption, defined 
as the natural logarithm of the consumed kWh (kilowatts per hour). The coefficients of interest 
are  𝛼1  and  𝛼2,  which  represent,  respectively,  the  price  and  income  elasticities  of  household 
electricity demand, which are associated with variables 𝑙𝑛𝑃ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑡 and 𝑙𝑛𝐼ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑡. The first is the 
amount paid per kWh and the last the household income. The interpretation of the coefficients 
is straightforward: 

 

𝜕𝑙𝑛𝐶ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦
𝜕𝑙𝑛𝑃ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦

= 𝛼1  and   

𝜕𝑙𝑛𝐶ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦
𝜕𝑙𝑛𝐼ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦

= 𝛼2  

 

 

 

(5) 

 
The  vector  containing  the  control  variables  is  represented  by  𝑋ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑡.  The  parameter 
vector 𝛿 identifies the effects of the controls on energy consumption. Finally, 𝑢ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑡 represents 
the random disturbance. 

Controls  are  separated  into  5  groups:  Group  1  representing  household  architectonic 
characteristics  (number  of  rooms,  bathrooms  and  restrooms  in  the  residence),  Group  2  for 
electrical equipment ownership (number of sound systems, air conditionings, vacuum cleaners, 

electric  showers,  microwaves,  refrigerators,  irons,  washing  machines,  and  computers  in  the 
residence),  Group  3  representing  property  status  (if  own  residence,  residence  in  acquisition, 
leased, rented, and others) and kind of residence (if house, apartment or flat, and others,) Group 
4  containing  household  occupant’s  characteristics  (average  age  of  the  residents,  number  of 
occupants under 18 years, and the instruction degree of the head of the family), and Group 5 
for  social  benefits  variables  (if  one  of  the  occupants  receives  Bolsa  Familia6  or  enrolls  in 
another social benefit program or if this person receives at least half of the national minimum 
wage). 
 
For the correct identification of the price and income elasticities, we must make sure 
that all possible sources of bias in the parameters are controlled for. Basically, we might have 
three major sources of endogeneity: measurement error, simultaneity, and omitted variable bias. 
The first is unlikely because data collection was done randomly by a known research center 
with  experienced  personnel.  It  should  be  noted  that  there  is  no  selection  bias  in  the  sample 
because data collection did not depend on the choice of the consumers. The second source of 
endogeneity,  the  simultaneity  problem,  is  not  sustainable  because  electric  energy  prices  are 
regulated by the central government and the residential energy tariff is rigid in the short-run (it 
does not react to changes in demand). If doubts, check section 2.  

The third source of endogeneity must be carefully considered. The omitted variable bias 
occurs  when  we  disregard  relevant  variables  that  are  potentially  correlated  with  the  other 
explanatory variables (prices and income). On that case, the error term becomes correlated with 
the  explanatory  variables  and  the  estimates  become  biased  and  inconsistent.  The  panel  data 
approach allows us to eliminate that bias when the omitted variables are constant over time, 
such as those within a given household, or a given family.  
 
4.2. Data 
 

We  use  data  from  the  Pesquisa  de  Orçamento  Familiar  (POF,  or  Household  Budget 
Survey)  which  is  conducted  by  the  Fundação  Instituto  de  Pesquisa  Econômica  (FIPE,  or 
Economic Research Institute Foundation). The data collected by the POF survey is not entirely 
open to the public because it contains private information regarding the interviewed families.  
We  had  access  to  the  complete  sample  and  could  obtain  information  about  the  household's 
energy  consumption,  family  income,  property  details,  among  other  variables.  The  sample 
covers  residences  in  the  metropolitan  area  of  São  Paulo  and  was  available  at  two  different 
periods,  1998-99  (POF98)  and  2008-13  (POF08).  For  the  first  sample,  information  was 
collected  from  1,207  residences  between  1998  and  1999,  with  households  being  selected 
randomly. The second period of the collection took place during the years 2008 to 2013 and 
information was collected from 3,126 residences. The second survey followed the households 
of the first sampling, and randomly enlarged the sample, that is, domiciles interviewed in the 
first  sample  were  also  interviewed  for  the  second  sample.  This  allowed  us  to  control  for 
residential and family fixed effects as mentioned before. 

To estimate price and income elasticities for the residential electricity consumption we 
consider those families that had information about the electricity bill, with the consumption of 
electric  energy  (kWh)  and  paid  values.  Thus,  the  valid  sample  for  the  POF98  was  627 
residences and for the POF08, 947 households. There are 270 domiciles with information for 
the light bill that are observed in both samples. Missing data on electric power consumption is 

                                                           
6 The Bolsa Família Program (PBF) is an income transfer program of the Brazilian Federal Government 
instituted by Provisional Measure 132, dated October 20, 2003, converted into a law on January 9, 2004, by 
Federal Law n. 10,836. Enrollment in the program is a necessary condition for reducing the light bill. 

likely caused by the resident not having the energy bill for that month available for presentation 
to the researcher at the time of the interview7. 

 The variable for the household energy consumption is given by the kilowatts appearing 
in the light bill that were consumed in the same month of the interview. The interviewers did 
not  consider  previous  electricity  bills.  Therefore,  consumed  energy  and  paid  values  were 
collected only upon the exhibition of the current light bill. Since energy tariff information was 
not gathered by the research, we calculate the electricity price by dividing the total paid value 
by  the  amount  consumed  in  that  residence8.  For  the  empirical  analysis,  both  variables  are 
transformed  to  the  natural  logarithm.  The  per  capita  family  income  was  calculated  by  the 
summing up all individual incomes and then dividing it by the number of economically active 
agents in that residence. For the empirical analysis, this variable was also transformed to the 
natural logarithm. The use of these variables in the natural logarithm form allows us to directly 
identify  the  price  and  income  elasticities  that  are  represented  by  the  associated  angular 
coefficients in the linear regressions.  

Control  variables  are  divided  into  five  groups.  Group  1  representing  household 
architectonic  characteristics  (number  of  rooms,  bathrooms  and  restrooms  in  the  residence), 
Group  2  for  electrical  equipment  ownership  (number  of  sound  systems,  air  conditionings, 
vacuum  cleaners,  electric  showers,  microwaves,  refrigerators,  irons,  washing  machines,  and 
computers in the residence), Group 3 representing property status (if own residence, residence 
in acquisition, leased, rented, and others) and kind of residence (if house, apartment or flat, and 
others,) Group 4 containing household occupant's characteristics (average age of the residents, 
number of occupants under 18 years, and the instruction degree of the head of the family), and 
Group 5 for social benefits variables (if the person who pays the bill receives Bolsa Familia9or 
enrolls in another social benefit program – SocialTariff1 –  or if this person receives as paycheck 
not more than half of the national minimum wage – SocialTariff2)10. For the variables in group 
4, the average age of the residents is constructed by dividing the sum of the ages of all residents, 
by the number of people living in the domicile. The instruction degree of the head of the family 
is given by seven education dummies11.  

Additionally, we have dummy variables identifying if the same residence is observed in 
both  periods  (POF  98  and  POF08)  if  the  same  family  continued  living  in  the  interviewed 
households12, the month of data collection and the year of data collection. In that way, we could 
control for household  fixed-effects,  family  fixed-effects,  seasonal/monthly  fixed-effects,  and 
macroeconomic/policy shocks captured by year fixed-effects.  

Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics separated by the two sampling periods, POF98 

and POF08.  

 

                                                           
7 We can consider that the domiciles left the panel randomly because we have information for all the other 
variables besides the energy bill. According to Cameron and Triverdi (2005) and Baltagi (2008), if missing data 
are random, then converting it into a panel structure results in a nonbiased sample. Therefore, analysis 
considering unbalanced or incomplete panels entails, at most, only a loss of efficiency. 
8 We are dealing with the actual cost of electricity to the families, considering the costs of generation, 
transmission, and distribution, that are incorporated into the energy tariff, plus taxes and charges at federal, state, 
and municipal levels. Paid values were deflated using the Consumer Price Index (General prices) calculated by 
FIPE (IPC/FIPE) and January 1998 as the reference period.

instituted by Provisional Measure 132, dated October 20, 2003, converted into a law on January 9, 2004, by 
Federal Law n. 10,836. Enrollment in the program is a necessary condition for reducing the light bill. 
10 People in those conditions are entitled to an energy discount and/or are eligible for the Social Energy Tariff 
program.  
11 The seven indicative variables are Illiterate; Elementary school incomplete, elementary complete, Secondary 
incomplete, secondary complete, University incomplete, University complete or more. 
12 Approximately 37% of the sample in the second period is composed of households with the same family.

We  can  see  from  Table  3  that  both  periods  have  similar  means  for  most  variables. 
However, it's important to note that both electricity consumption and energy prices are lower 
for  the  second  period  of  sample13.  Regarding  the  controls,  the  majority  remains  very  close 

                                                           
13 The energy/rationing crises of 2001 changed the Brazilian habits regarding energy consumption. Even with 
lower prices, the residential energy consumption returned to 2000 levels only in 2005 (WEO,2013). During the 

between periods, except for the number of dishwashers, number of computers, and the average 
age of the residents. 
 
 
5. Empirical results 
 

Estimation  results  for  equation  (4)  are  reported  in  Table  4.  We  present  nine  models 
differing  basically  in  the  use  of  control  variables.  Specification  1  is  a  Pooled  OLS  with  no 
controls and/or fixed-effects. Subsequent models add separately both the fixed effects as well 
as the control variables and are estimated using panel data techniques.  In the last specification 
(Model  9)  all  controls  and  fixed-effects  are  considered.  Price  and  income  elasticities  of 
household  electricity  demand,  for  each  specification,  are  represented  by  the  𝜀𝑃  and  𝜀𝐼 
coefficients, respectively.

elasticity  
(𝜀𝑃)  has  the  expected  sign,  being  negative  for  all  proposed  specifications  and  it’s  mostly 
inelastic. This means that an increase in the residential cost of energy reduces the amount of 
kWh consumed by the individual households, but with smaller impact reflecting the “essential-
good” characteristic of electric energy. In more specific terms, the calculated price elasticities 
vary between -0.4445 (model 3) and -0.5644 (model 1). For the complete specification (Model 
9), a 1% increase in the residential electricity cost reduces the residential energy consumption 
by 0.50%.

The  results  for  income  elasticity  (𝜀𝐼)  also  show  the  expected  signs,  with  positive 
coefficients across specifications. The coefficients magnitudes vary between 0.1977 (model 8) 
and  0.3222  (model  1),  reflecting  that  increases  in  real  income  produce  positive  impacts  on 
energy consumption. However, as for the price elasticities, these impacts are small. Considering 
the  Model  (9),  a  1%  increase  in  the  average  household  income  implies  an  increase  of 
approximately  0.21%  in  residential  electric  energy  consumption.  That  is,  the  residential 
consumption of electric energy is income-inelastic.  

In general terms, the results in Table 4 are different from those at previous works for 
Brazil. The comparison of our results with the existing literature is hard because the periods of 
analysis are different, as well as the applied methodologies and the data’s degree of aggregation. 
As highlighted in the literature review, no other work for Brazil has identified price and income 
elasticities with this level of data disaggregation, nor with the applied methodology. It should 
be noted, however, that Siqueira et al. (2006) fond relatively close coefficients. Their calculated 
price  and  income  elasticities  are,  respectively,  0.30,  and  0.18.  They  use  aggregated  data  for 
Northeast Brazil and the 1970-2003 period.  

With  respect  to  the  international  literature,  the  works  of  Schulte  and  Heindl  (2017), 
Wang and Mogi  (2017), Zhou and Teng (2013), Arthur et al.  (2012), Filippini and Pachauri 
(2004), and Nesbakken et al. (1999) found a price elasticity of electric energy demand close to 
-0.50, for different countries and different data structures. Zhou and Teng (2013), using urban-
household level data for China, also found an income elasticity close to 0.21. 

The next section presents robustness checks for our results.

5.1.  Robustness Checks 
 
 
Here  we  consider  different  samples  and  methodologies  than  from  the  previous 
section. We first identify the price and income elasticities by disaggregating the valid data 
for  each  sample  separately  (POF98  and  POF08).  In  model  (1)  we  calculate  the 
coefficients considering the POF98 using a standard OLS approach. In specification (2) 
we  consider  observations  from  POF08  and  estimate  de  elasticities  also  using  an  OLS 
methodology.  

In  the  model  (3)  data  are  aggregated  and  price  and  income  elasticities  are 
estimated using a random effects approach (RE-FGLS). For the model (4) we restrict the 
sample  only  to  the  households  that  appear  in  both  samples  and  run  the  regression 
assuming the random effects hypothesis (RE-FGLS). In specification (5) we also restrict 
the sample to repeating residences but calculate the coefficients with a First-Difference 
methodology.  Finally,  we  present  the  fixed  effects  model  only  for  the  households  that 
repeat in both samples (balanced panel with fixed-effects, model 6).  

Table 5 presents the results for all six models, considering robust standard errors 

for heteroscedasticity in all specifications.

Notes: Significance level, * < 0.10; **<0.05; ***<0.01; Robust t-statistics in parentheses. We consider all 
the  controls  from  Model  9  in Table  4,  except  for  specifications  1  and  2  because  they  are  cross-sections 
estimated with OLS approach (the fixed effects of residence and family are not considered). Is Model 3, 
the hypothesis of random effects is considered for households, but family, month and year fixed effects are 
also included. Models 4 to 6 are balanced panels. Model 4 is estimated under random effects. Models 5 and 
6 control for household fixed-effects using first-difference and fixed-effects techniques, respectively. 
 
 
In Table 5, all estimations show the expected signs and are statistically significant 
 
for the price elasticity (𝜀𝑃) and the income elasticity (𝜀𝐼). Models 1 and 2 show a large 
variation  between  the  estimated  coefficients  for  the  two  different  periods  using  OLS 
methodology. Models 4 to 6 show more similar results to table 4, even though they have 
significantly smaller samples. Price elasticity ranges between -0.505 and -0.498. Income 
elasticities  are  between  0.278  and  0.17.  We  apply  a  Hausman  specification  test  to 
compare  models  4  and  6  and  results  suggest  that  the  fixed  effects  approach  is 
recommended (Chi² of 84.35 with a p-value of 0.0017).  

Model  6,  restricting  the  sample  to  only  those  households  that  appear  in  both 
samples (balanced panel with fixed-effects), produced the same coefficients as Model 9 
in  Table  4  (unbalanced  panel  with  all  controls  and  fixed-effects).  Therefore,  in  both 
models, the price elasticity of residential energy demand is -0.5038 (𝜀𝑃), and the income 
price elasticity for residential energy demand is 0.2054 (𝜀𝐼). 
 
6. Conclusions and Policy Implications 
 

This paper fills a gap in the literature on residential energy consumption in Brazil. 
We  are  the  first  to  empirically  estimate  price  and  income  elasticities  for  household 

electricity consumption using microdata and a panel approach. Household level data is 
more informative than aggregated data because we can control for household and family 
characteristics that might affect energy consumption, seasonality, and other unobservable 
characteristics,  such  as  macroeconomic/policy  shocks,  by  using  fixed  effects.  We  also 
include  a  variety  of  observable  variables  as  controls  for  household  architectonic 
characteristics,  electrical  equipment  ownership,  property  status,  kind  of  residence, 
household  occupant’s  characteristics,  and  social  benefits.  No  previous  work  for  Brazil 
employs  this  level  of  disaggregation  and  such  comprehensive  list  of  individual 
characteristics to estimate the parameters. Therefore, our main contribution to empirical 
research is an accurate identification of price and income elasticities for the residential 
electrical consumption for the São Paulo metropolitan area. 

The estimated price elasticity ranges from -0.26 to -0.64, and the estimated income 
elasticity between 0.11 and 0.32. Considering the most appropriate model, the price and 
income elasticities of the demand for residential electric power are, approximately, -0.50, 
and 0.21, respectively. Results are robust even for different methodologies and selected 
smaller  samples.  The  unbalanced  panel  with  all  controls  and  fixed-effects  included 
(Model  9  in  Table  4)  produced  the  same  coefficients  as  the  balanced  panel  with  the 
smaller  sample  and  fixed  effects  (Model  6  in  Table  5).  Considering  those  models,  the 
price-elasticity  of  residential  energy  demand  and  the  income-elasticity  of  residential 
energy  demand  are,  respectively,  -0.50  and  0.21,  revealing  that  the  consumption  of 
electricity is inelastic and responds very little to increases in the cost of energy or family 
income.  

The policy implications of the presented results are diverse. We have identified 
that the consumer's sensitivity to price and income variations is small so that increases in 
real family income will have little impact on the demand for energy, as increases in the 
energy cost. The calculated elasticities can be used by policymakers, energy production 
and distribution companies to target investment and/or forecasting strategies. In addition, 
indirectly,  the  results  can  serve  as  instruments  for  environmental  policies  and  studies 
associated with the generation of greenhouse gases.
