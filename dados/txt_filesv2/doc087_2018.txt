ABSTRACT 

The paper argues that Harrodian instability is an instance of what Hicks (1965) called static instability, related to 
the  direction  (and  not  to  the  intensity)  of  the  disequilibrium  adjustment  process.  We  show  why  such  instability 
obtains in demand-led growth models in which the ratio of capacity creating private investment to output ratio is 
given  exogenously  by  the  aggregate  marginal  propensity  to  save.  We  also  show  that  Sraffian  Supermultiplier 
model overcomes the Harrodian instability and that its demand-led equilibrium is statically stable. It is explained 
that  the  latter  results  do  not  follow  from  the  presence  of  autonomous  non-capacity  creating  expenditure 
component  as  such  but  from  its  presence  within  a  model  in  which  investment  is  driven  by  the  capital  stock 
adjustment  principle  (i.e.,  the  flexible  accelerator).  Finally,  we  argue  that,  although  being  statically  stable,  the 
equilibrium growth path of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model can be  dynamically stable or unstable depending 
on the intensity of the reaction of investment to demand. We then provide a discrete time sufficient condition for 
the dynamic stability of  such equilibrium that implies that the marginal propensity to invest remains lower than 
the marginal propensity to save during the adjustment process, a modified Keynesian stability condition. 

 

RESUMO 

O artigo argumenta que a instabilidade de Harrodiana é um exemplo do que Hicks (1965) chamou de instabilidade 
estática,  relacionada  à  direção  (e  não  à  intensidade)  do  processo  de  ajuste  em  desequilíbrio.    Nós  mostramos  a 
razão pela qual este tipo de instabilidade é obtida em modelos de crescimento liderados pela demanda nos quais a 
taxa de investimento é determinada exogenamente pela propensão marginal a poupar. Também mostramos que o 
modelo  do  Supermultiplicador  Sraffiano  permite  superar  o  problema  da  instabilidade  de  Harrodiana  e  que  seu 
steady-state é estaticamente estável. Explicamos que estes últimos resultados não decorrem apenas da presença de 
um componente autônomo da demanda agregada que não cria capacidade, mas sim da sua presença num modelo 
em que o investimento é impulsionado  pelo princípio do ajustamento do estoque de capital (isto é, o acelerador 
flexível).  Finalmente,  argumentamos  que,  embora  seja  estaticamente  estável,  a  trajetória  de  crescimento  de 
equilíbrio  do  modelo  Supermultiplicador  Sraffiano  pode  ser  dinamicamente  estável  ou  instável  dependendo  da 
intensidade  da  reação  do  investimento  à  demanda.  Em  seguida,  fornecemos  uma  condição  suficiente  em  tempo 
discreto para a estabilidade dinâmica de tal equilíbrio. Esta condição implica que a propensão marginal a investir 
permanece  menor  que  a  propensão  marginal  à  poupar  durante  o  processo  de  ajustamento  ao  equilíbrio,  uma 
condição Keynesiana de estabilidade modificada.

The Trouble with Harrod: the fundamental instability of the warranted rate 

in the light of the Sraffian Supermultiplier 

 

INTRODUCTION 

1 
 

Harrod’s  (1939,  1948,  1973)  concept  of    the  “Fundamental  Instability  of  the  warranted  rate  of  growth”, 
now known as  “Harrodian instability”, has  for long been seen as an obstacle  to the development of satisfactory 
demand-led  growth  models  based  on the  “marriage  between  the multiplier and  the accelerator”.  The paper  uses 
the results of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model1 to explain under which conditions and, more importantly, why 
this  “fundamental  instability”  characterizes  the  equilibrium  path  of  the  Harrodian  model.  From  our  analysis,  it 
follows  that  the  possible  incompatibility  between  demand-led  growth  models  and  capacity  creating  private 
investment  being  driven  by  the  (flexible)  accelerator  is  only  apparent.  The  Sraffian  supermultiplier  model 
overcomes  such  apparent  incompatibility  by  combining  the  investment  function  based  on  the  capital  stock 
adjustment principle with the presence of an autonomous non-capacity creating component in aggregate demand. 

Our analysis proceeds in two successive steps. First, we clarify the economic meaning and some important 
theoretical  implications  of  the  Harrodian  notion  of  warranted  rate  of  growth  and  the  related  “principle  of 
fundamental instability”. For this purpose, we use the theoretical results provided by the Sraffian Supermultiplier 
model (Serrano 1995a, 1995b), together with Hicks’s notions of  “static” and “dynamic” stability (Hicks, 1965), 
the latter being related to the distinction between the direction versus the intensity of a disequilibrium adjustment. 
We then explain why the Harrodian warranted rate of growth path is indeed fundamentally or statically unstable 
under  very  general  conditions.2  This  step  in  our  argument  is  important  because  sometimes  Harrodian  instability 
has been misinterpreted as being the consequence of the intensity of the investment reaction to the disequilibrium 
between capacity and aggregate demand. In contrast, we argue that real problem behind the Harrodian instability 
is that the adjustment of capacity towards normal utilization requires changes in the investment to output ratio that 
the  Harrodian  model  cannot  produce  since  the  saving  ratio  (the  marginal  propensity  to  save)  is  exogenously 
determined. Thus, the investment function based on the capital stock adjustment principle should not  be blamed 
for the Harrodian instability. The latter is characterized by the wrong direction of the disequilibrium adjustment 
process, being, thus, a case of static instability in the Hicksian sense.  

In the second step of our analysis, we explain why this type of Harrodian instability does not occur in the 
Sraffian  Supermultiplier  model.  In  this  connection,  we  show  that  the  presence  of  autonomous  non-capacity 
creating  demand  implies  that  the  reaction  of  induced  investment  to  an  initial  imbalance  between  capacity  and 
demand has, at some point during the disequilibrium adjustment process, a greater impact on the rate of growth of 
productive  capacity  than  on  the  rate  of  growth  of  demand.  The  latter  result  reverts  the  tendency  towards  an 
increasing deviation of the actual degree of capacity utilization from its normal level that characterizes Harrodian 
instability. Thus, we argue that the demand-led growth equilibrium path of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model is 
statically  stable, in direct contrast with the static instability that characterizes the Harrodian  equilibrium. As we 
explain, it is important to note that the latter result does not follow from the presence of a non-capacity creating 
expenditure component as such, but from its presence within a model in which investment is driven by the capital 
stock  adjustment  principle.  Nonetheless,  we  argue  that,  although  being  statically  stable,  the  equilibrium  growth 
path of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model can be dynamically stable or unstable depending on the intensity of the 
reaction of investment to demand. We then provide a discrete time  sufficient condition for the dynamic stability 
of such equilibrium that implies that the marginal propensity to invest remains lower than the marginal propensity 

                                                           
1 This model is characterized by distribution being exogenous (and determined along Sraffian lines), investment being totally induced by the adjustment of capacity 
to demand and the importance of autonomous demand components that do not create capacity for the private sector of the economy. These hypotheses were largely 
inspired by the work of Garegnani (1962), which explains why the model was called Sraffian Supermultiplier in Serrano (1995a, 1995b). Recently, Cesaratto (2016) 
has  discovered  that  the  idea  of  adapting  Hicks’s  (1950)  trade  cycle  Supermultiplier  for  the  analysis  of  the  trend  of  demand-led  growth  driven  by  autonomous 
demand  was  first  introduced  by  Ackley  (1963)  in  an  econometric  model  developed  for  the  Italian  economy  and  published  only  in  Italian.  The  latter  work  was 
probably  influenced  by  discussions  relating  to  Garegnani  (1962).  Recently,  chapters  III  and  IV  of  the  latter  work  have  been  p ublished  in  English  as  Garegnani 
(2015).  
2 In this paper we are not concerned with the other problem pointed out by Harrod, that is, the reconciliation of the warranted rate of growth and a “natural rate” of 
growth given by the sum of exogenous rates of growth the labor force and its productivity. 

 
to  save  during  the  adjustment  process.3  Finally,  it  is  argued  that  the  latter  condition  is  a  modified  “Keynesian 
stability”  condition  in  the  sense  that  it  can  deal  with  the  variability  of  the  propensity  to  invest  required  by  the 
operation of the flexible accelerator.

It should be stressed that our purpose here is not to present an exegetical analysis Harrod’s writings. What 

matters to us here is the general problem posed by the Harrodian model to modern heterodox growth theory.4 

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  section  2  we  present,  very  briefly,  Hicks’s  notions  of 
static and dynamic stability. In section 3 we discuss the meaning of Harrod’s warranted rate and show that growth 
at this rate is indeed fundamentally or statically unstable, as the adjustment always goes in the wrong direction. In 
section  4  we  discuss  the  Sraffian  Supermultiplier  and  show  that  while  the  model  is  statically  stable,  it  may  be 
dynamically  stable  or  unstable  depending  on  the  intensity  of  the  reaction  of  investment  to  demand.  The  next 
section  (section  5),  situates  our  contribution  in  relation  to  the  recent  literature  on  the  Harrodian  and 
Supermultipler growth models. Finally, in the last section, we present some final remarks. Appendices A and B 
contain  discrete  time  formal  proofs  of  Harrodian  fundamental  or  static  instability,  and  a  set  of  sufficient 
conditions for the dynamic stability of the Sraffian Supermultiplier, respectively. 

 

2  HICKS ON “STATIC” AND “DYNAMIC” INSTABILITY 

 
For Hicks, the distinction between “static” and “dynamic” instability relates to the  direction and intensity 
of  the  disequilibrium  adjustment  process,  respectively.  Thus,  an  equilibrium  is  statically  unstable  if  the 
disequilibrium adjustment process leads the economic system in the “wrong” direction, away from its equilibrium 
state, independently  of  the  intensity  (or  speed)  of  the  adjustment  process.  However,  even  an  equilibrium  that  is 
“statically” stable can still be “dynamically” unstable, if the adjustment process is too intense  so as to lead to a 
chronic overshooting of the equilibrium position through undamped cycles. “Static” stability is thus a necessary, 
but  not  sufficient  condition  for  “dynamic”  stability.  On  the  other  hand,  a  “statically”  unstable  model  is  thus 
inherently unstable. 

In  a  long  footnote  Hicks  (1965,  p.  18,  fn.  2)5  clarifies  these  concepts  with  the  simple  example  of  a 
Neoclassical partial equilibrium analysis of a market with given supply and demand curves. In this context, if the 
resulting excess demand function is negatively sloped the equilibrium is statically stable. On the other hand, if for 
some reason the excess demand function is positively sloped, the  equilibrium of the model is statically, and thus 
inherently, unstable. However, assuming that the excess demand function is well behaved and negatively sloped is 
not  sufficient  to  ensure  dynamic  stability.  Indeed,  if  the  reaction  of  the  market  price  to  excess  demand  is  not 
continuous but happens in discrete or lumpy jumps, for  sufficiently high  values of the parameters one may  find 
that the equilibrium is dynamically unstable. In this case,  although static conditions point the adjustment process 
in the right direction as defined by economic theory, there can be an overshooting of the equilibrium point, as in 
the well-known undamped cycles of the cobweb theorem. Conversely, if the reaction parameters are sufficiently 
small, there will be a tendency towards equilibrium whether monotonic or through dampened cycles. Thus, static 
stability does not depend on the intensity or magnitude of the reaction to disequilibria but only on its  direction. 
Dynamic stability, on the other hand, depends on the magnitude of the adjustment parameters and, therefore, on 
the intensity of the adjustment process. 

Hicks (1965) concludes that static stability conditions are more basic, in the sense that if they are not met, 
the equilibrium of the model in question will be dynamically unstable for any value of the adjustment parameters 
compatible  with  the  subjacent  economic  theory.6  We  believe  that  Harrod’s  principle  of  the  “fundamental 
instability” of growth at the “warranted rate” can  be fruitfully interpreted as an example of “static” instability in 
the sense of Hicks. 

                                                           
3 We  develop  the  model  in a discrete  time  framework  because  we  believe  that it provides  a more  intuitive  description  of  the  economic  meaning  of  the  dynamic 
adjustment processes between capacity and demand. 
4 We readily acknowledge that in our analysis we left out some specific characteristics of Harrod’s own analytical framework such as: the use of instantaneous rates 
of  growth;  the  discussion  of  the  short-term  disequilibria  between  production  and  demand;  the  assumption  of  a  large  set  of  available  techniques  with    only  one 
chosen at the exogenously given rate of interest; some nonlinearities in the behavior of the saving ratio and the technical capital-output ratio; the integrated analysis 
of both the trend and the cycle, among others. On these matters see Besomi (2001). 
5 To the best of our knowledge, Hicks never used these concepts to interpret either Harrod or his own version of Supermultiplier model. The present paper is not 
about Hicks’s own work. We are taking from him just the crucial distinction between the direction and the intensity of disequilibrium adjustments.  
6  For  a  fuller  discussion  of  the  importance  of  these  Hicksian  concepts,  illustrated  by  the  debate  between  Sraffian  and  Neoclassical  theories  of  distribution  and 
relative prices, see Serrano (2011).

3  HARROD’S WARRANTED RATE AND THE PRINCIPLE OF “FUNDAMENTAL 

INSTABILITY” 

 

3.1 

The actual, capacity and warranted growth rates 

 
Harrod (1939, 1948 and 1973) presented a growth model that was to be based on the “marriage between 
the  ‘principle  of  acceleration’  with  the  ‘theory  of  the  multiplier’.”  The  combination  of  the  multiplier  and  the 
accelerator should allow him to deal with the dual character of investment. The multiplier treats investment7 as a 
source  of  aggregate  demand,  while  the  accelerator  deals  with  the  capacity  creating  role  of  investment  and  its 
possible impact on further investment decisions. Harrod investigates the conditions for steady growth in  a simple 
model, i.e., under which conditions the demand and capacity effects of investment can be reconciled, allowing the 
existence of a growth path in which productive capacity and demand are balanced with a continuous utilization of 
productive capacity at its normal or planned level.8 

These  conditions  are  expressed  using  Harrod’s  “fundamental  equation”,  derived  from  the  equality 
between investment and saving when output is equal to demand, divided by the capital stock. The right-hand side 
component of such equality can be tautologically decomposed as follows: 

𝑔𝐾𝑡+1 =

𝐼𝑡
𝐾𝑡

=

𝑆𝑡
𝑌𝑡

∗
𝑌𝑡
𝐾𝑡

𝑌𝑡
∗ =
𝑌𝑡

𝑠
𝑣

𝑢𝑡 

1) 

The above expression tells us that the rate of growth of the capital stock is identical to the product of the 
average  propensity  to  save  (𝑆𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄ ),  the  reciprocal  of  the  normal  capital-output  ratio  (𝑣 = 1 (𝑌𝑡
)  and  the 
∗⁄ ). In Harrod’s model, the average propensity to save is equal to 
actual degree of capacity utilization (𝑢𝑡 = 𝑌𝑡 𝑌𝑡
and  determined  by  the  marginal  propensity  to  save  (𝑠),  taken  here  as  exogenously  determined  by  consumption 
habits and income distribution. In his analysis of the fundamental instability of the warranted rate, Harrod did not 
consider the existence of an autonomous and independently growing level of autonomous consumption.  

∗ 𝐾𝑡⁄ )

⁄

Thus,  with all  consumption  being  induced, the  actual  level  of  output  determined  by  effective  demand  is 

given by: 

𝑌𝑡 =

𝐼𝑡
𝑠

 

2) 
Thus, in this model, for a given value of the marginal propensity to save, the actual rate of growth of the 
economy  (𝑔𝑡)  is  equal  to,  and  determined  by,  the  rate  of  growth  of  investment  𝑔𝐼𝑡  (since  consumption 
expenditures always grows at the same rate as investment). Moreover, the rate of growth of the capital stock (and 
capacity  output)  (𝑔𝐾𝑡)  also  always  follows,  with  a  certain  lag,  the  rate  of  growth  of  investment.  This  happens 
because the relation between the rate of growth of  (net) investment and the rate of growth of the capital stock is 
given by:9 

𝑔𝐾𝑡+1 = 𝑔𝐾𝑡 (

1 + 𝑔𝐼𝑡
1 + 𝑔𝐾𝑡

) 

3) 

Which is always tending to 𝑔𝐾𝑡 = 𝑔𝐼𝑡. Thus, it follows that (1) will tend to: 

𝑔𝐼𝑡 =

𝑢𝑡  

𝑠
𝑣

4) 
From (4) we obtain Harrod’s (1939, p. 17) “fundamental equation” by setting the actual degree of capacity 

utilization equal to its planned value (𝑢𝑡 = 𝑢𝑛 = 1):  

𝑔𝑊 =

𝑠
𝑣

  

                                                           
7In this paper by investment we mean only those expenditures that can create productive capacity for the private business sector of the economy. We thus leave out 
of our analysis private residential investment and investment by government and state owned enterprises. 
8  In  what  follows  we  are  making  a  number  of  standard  simplifying  assumptions.  The  economy  is  closed  and  there  is  no  distinct  government  sector. We  take  all 
magnitudes net of depreciation. We also assume that the economy produces a single product using only homogenous labor and itself as fixed capital, by means of 
single  method  of  production  with  constant  returns  to  scale.  We  also  assume  that  labor  is  always  abundant  and  thus  capacity  output  is  given  by  the  size  and 
efficiency  of  the  capital  stock.  We  take  the  real  wage  and  labor  productivity  (no  technical  progress)  as  exogenously  given.  We  further  assume  that  firms  have 
𝑚𝑎𝑥.  We  normalize  the  normal  or  planned  degree  of  capacity 
planned  spare  capacity  so  that  normal  or  potential  output  𝑌𝑡
utilization as 𝑢𝑛 = 1 so that 𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝑌𝑡
∗⁄ = 1 + 𝛾 (where 𝛾 is the percentage of planned spare capacity). Finally, we suppose that short-term expectations are 
always correct so that there is no involuntary accumulation of inventories. 
9 The capital available at the beginning of period 𝑡 + 1 is 𝐾𝑡+1 = 𝐾𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡. Hence, we have 𝑔𝐾𝑡+1 = 𝐼𝑡 𝐾𝑡⁄ = (𝐼𝑡−1 𝐾𝑡−1
(1 + 𝑔𝐾𝑡)).

5) 
Equation (5) shows the condition for the balance between the growth of capacity and demand in Harrod’s 
model.  Harrod  called  “warranted  rate”  this  particular  rate  of  growth  (𝑔𝑊).  The  warranted  rate  is  a  positive 
function of the marginal propensity to save and a negative function of the normal capital-output ratio.  

Although one of Harrod’s aims was to extend to the longer run (when the capacity effects of investment 
matter)  some  of  Keynes’s  arguments  that  were  presented  in  a  short  run  context,  actual  growth  at  the  warranted 
rate  has  to  be  understood  as  a  condition  for  the  validity  of  Say’s  Law  in  the  longer  run.  In  fact,  note  that  the 
warranted rate is not the actual rate of growth of aggregate demand and output, which, as we have seen above, is 
determined  by  the  actual  rate  of  growth  of  investment  (𝑔𝐼𝑡).  The  warranted  rate  is  also  not  the  actual  rate  of 
growth  of  the  capital  stock  and  potential  output.  The  rate  of  growth  of  the capital  stock,  as  we  saw above,  also 
tends to grow at the same rate as investment grows. Instead, Harrod’s warranted rate represents the rate of growth 
of potential output that would only occur if investment happened to be in every single period, including the initial 
one,  exactly  equal  to  and determined  by  the  saving  obtained at normal  or  planned capacity  utilization  (capacity 
saving  from  now  on).  Growth  at  the  warranted  rate  would  only  occur  if  demand adjusted itself  to  the  level  and 
growth rate of productive capacity. As Harrod follows Keynes in rejecting Say’s Law, he concludes correctly that 
there is no reason for a market economy to grow at the warranted rate. If we take the rate of growth of investment 
as provisionally given, we know that the actual rate of growth of the economy will be determined by this rate of 
growth  of  investment  (𝑔 = 𝑔𝐼).  On  the  other  hand,  for  a  given  technique,  we  know  that  the  actual  degree  of 
capacity utilization will change according to the ratio between the rate of growth of demand 𝑔𝑡 (and output) and 
the rate of growth of the capital stock 𝑔𝐾𝑡: 

6) 
With an exogenously given rate of growth of investment 𝑔𝐼, both aggregate demand (and output) and the 
capital stock (with some lag) will tend to grow at this given rate and thus the actual degree of capacity utilization 
will tend to stabilize at the level: 

𝑢𝑡 = 𝑢𝑡−1 (

1 + 𝑔𝑡
1 + 𝑔𝐾𝑡

) 

𝑢𝑡 =

𝑔𝐼
𝑠 𝑣⁄

 

7) 
Hence, an actual rate of growth of investment and output above the warranted rate (𝑔𝐼 > 𝑔𝑤) would lead 
to  persistent  overutilization  of  productive  capacity  (𝑢 > 1)  and  that, conversely,  a  rate  of  growth  of  investment 
below the warranted rate (𝑔𝐼 < 𝑔𝑤) would make the economy tend to a situation of persistent underutilization of 
productive capacity (𝑢 < 1). Thus, with decisions to invest being independent from decisions to save, growth at 
Harrod’s warranted rate would happen only as a fluke. 

 

3.2 

The fundamental instability of growth at the warranted rate  

 
Harrod went beyond demonstrating that there was no reason for the economy to grow at the warranted rate 
(𝑠 𝑣⁄ ) and that the actual degree of capacity utilization would tend to a level different from the planned level if 
investment grew at a given exogenous rate. Harrod showed that, if investment is taken to be induced, in the sense 
of being driven by  what we now call the principle of capital stock adjustment (i.e., the accelerator), any rate of 
growth  of  investment  different  from  the  warranted  rate  would  cause  a  cumulative  disequilibrium  process, 
illustrating what he called the “principle of fundamental instability” of growth at the warranted rate. 

One way of representing the operation of the principle of fundamental instability is by taking the reaction 
of the rate of growth of investment to the deviation of the actual degree of capacity utilization from its planned 
level, according to:  

8), 
where  𝛼 > 0,  in  accordance  to  the  capital  stock  adjustment  principle.  Equation  (8)  shows  that  an 
overutilization  of  capacity  (𝑢 > 1)  will  make  firms  increase  the  rate  of  growth  of  investment,  while 

𝑔𝐼𝑡 = 𝑔𝐼𝑡−1 + 𝛼(𝑢𝑡−1 − 1 ) 

(

(

(

 
underutilization (𝑢 < 1) will make them reduce it. In both cases, this (reasonable) type of reaction, when firms are 
trying to adjust capacity to demand, will make the economy move further away from its warranted rate.10 

6 

While  a  given  rate  of  growth  of  investment  𝑔𝐼  leads  to  a  stable  level  of  the  actual  degree  of  capacity 
utilization, every time the growth rate of investment changes, the corresponding equilibrium level of the degree of 
capacity utilization also changes. This follows from the fact that the initial effect of a rise in  𝑔𝐼 is the increase in 
the rate of growth of aggregate demand by more than the growth of capacity, because investment is always first an 
increase in demand and only later it leads to an increase in productive capacity (conversely a fall in 𝑔𝐼 makes the 
growth  of  demand  𝑔  fall  before  the  fall  of  𝑔𝐾  according  to  equation  (3)).  Therefore,  each  round  of  increases 
(reductions)  in  the  rate  of  growth  of  investment  due  to  the  actual  degree  of  utilization  being  initially  higher 
(lower)  than  the  planned degree  would  lead  to  a  new,  even  higher  (lower), actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization 
and so on, as described by equation (6). This is the core of the principle of “fundamental instability” of Harrod’s 
warranted  rate.  Any  divergence  between  the  actual  and  planned  degree  of  utilization  would,  by  the  mechanism 
just described, be self-reinforcing. 

This  instability  was  considered  fundamental  by  Harrod  because  the  adjustment  occurs  in  the  wrong 
direction, independently of the (positive) magnitude of the reaction parameter α. Harrod himself noted that it was 
“independent of lags”. It is also easy to note that introducing more lags in the connection between the growth rate 
of  investment  and  deviations  of  capacity  utilization  from  planned  levels  would  not  change  the  problem,  as  this 
would not change the direction of the adjustment process.  The reason why growth at Harrod’s warranted rate is 
fundamentally unstable has to do with the direction and is, in fact, independent of the intensity of the adjustment, 
being thus a case of Hicksian static instability (see Appendix A below for a formal proof). 

This fundamental or static character of Harrod’s instability principle has naturally given to many authors 
the impression that a demand-led growth model simply has to assume that, at least in the longer run, the growth 
rate  of  investment  is either  totally  autonomous  or,  at  most,  that  it  reacts in a  quite  limited  way  to  the  deviation 
between  actual  and  planned  degrees  of  utilization.  A  limited  reaction  in  the  sense  that  the  rate  of  growth  of 
investment or the desired rate of capital accumulation must have an autonomous (“animal spirits”) term and must 
reach a given stable value even if the actual degree of capacity utilization is still different from its planned degree 
(as  in  the  Neo-Kaleckians  models,  Lavoie  (2014)).  Any  other  investment  function,  fully  compatible  with  the 
capital stock adjustment principle (such as equation (8) above) would simply generate instability. 

Note also that things would in fact be much worse if assumptions were made that, somehow, make growth 
at Harrod’s warranted rate dynamically stable.  First, because in this case, we would necessarily have to assume, 
directly or by some indirect route, that the rate of growth of investment in the economy, in fact, increases when 
the  degree  of  capacity  utilization  is  lower  than  the  planned  level  and  decreases  when  there  is  overutilization, 
something  that  is  highly  implausible.  Secondly,  and  to  make  matters  even  worse,  if  somehow  it  is  proven  that 
growth at Harrod’s warranted rate is stable, we would, at the same time, have also “proved” the validity of Say’s 
Law  in  the  longer  run.  For  if,  for  instance,  the  warranted  rate  were  stable  then  an  increase  in  the  marginal 
propensity to save would cause a permanent increase  in the levels and rates of growth of investment, output and 
capacity output. 

 

 

4  THE SRAFFIAN SUPERMULTIPLIER  

However, the fact that growth at the warranted rate  𝑠/𝑣 is inherently unstable does not mean, as it may 
seem,  that  any  demand-led  growth  model  with  investment  induced  according  to  the  principle  of  capital  stock 
adjustment  will  also  be  necessarily  unstable.  In  fact,  we  may  reach  quite  different  results  if  we  include  an 
exogenous and independently growing component of autonomous expenditures that do not create capacity for the 
private  business  sector  of  the  economy.  The  “marriage  between  the  accelerator  and  the  multiplier”  can  indeed 
succeed  if  this  source  of  autonomous  demand  is  present  and  its  growth  may  lead  to  a  stable  process  of  truly 
demand-led growth. 
                                                           
10  Although  we  are  here  making  the  rate  of  growth  of  investment  a  function  of  the  deviation  between  actual  and  the  planned  degrees  of  utilization,  the  same 
reasoning would apply if we use different specifications of the investment function based on the capital stock adjustment principle. For instance, the same results 
obtain if we make the growth rate of investment a function of an expected trend rate of growth, partially revised in the light of actually observed rates of growth of 
the  economy,  or  if  the  rate  of  growth  of  investment  depended  both  on  the  expected  rate  of  growth  and  the  deviation  of  the  actual  degree  of  utilization  from its 
planned  degree.  As  we  shall  explain  shortly,  the  fundamental  instability  result  follows  from  the  fact  that  aggregate  demand  always  rises  and  falls  in  the  same 
proportion as investment, not on the specific form of the induced investment function based on the capital stock adjustment principle.

Autonomous consumption and the fraction  

7 

To  see  why  let  us  assume  that  there  is  an  autonomous  component  in  consumption  𝑍  that  grows  at  an 
exogenous rate 𝑧.11 Now, differently from the Harrodian model from the previous section, the aggregate marginal 
and average propensities to save are not the same. Indeed, the average propensity to save (S/Y) is given by: 

𝑆𝑡
𝑌𝑡

= 𝑠 −

𝑍𝑡
𝑌𝑡

 

9) 
The  marginal  propensity  to  save  does  not  determine,  but  only  imposes  an  upper  bound,  to  the  average 
propensity to save. Although the marginal propensity to save is exogenously given, the average propensity to save 
now  depends  on  the  actual  level  of  output.  An  increase  in  the  level  of  output  in  relation  to  autonomous 
consumption,  caused  by  an  increase  in  investment  in  relation  to  output,  reduces  the  relative  weight  of  the 
“dissaving” represented by the autonomous consumption component, increasing the ratio between average and the 
marginal propensities to save. 

The  latter  result  becomes  more  clear  when  we  express  the  average  propensity  to  save  in  terms  of  the 

(

independent variables that determine it. As 𝑆𝑡/𝑌𝑡 = 𝐼𝑡/𝑌𝑡 and 𝑌𝑡 = (𝐼𝑡 + 𝑍𝑡)/𝑠, then: 

𝑆𝑡
𝑌𝑡

= 𝑠 (

11) 
The  endogenous  variable  𝑓  is  what  Serrano  (1995b)  called  “the  fraction”.  It  corresponds  to  the  ratio 
between  average  and  marginal  propensities  to  save.  Equation  (10)  shows  that  the  average  propensity  to  save 
depends both on the marginal propensity to save and on the level of autonomous consumption relative to the level 
of investment. An increase in the latter increases now both the level and the share of saving in output. Below the 
upper  limit  given  by  the  exogenous  marginal  propensity  to  save  s,  it  is  the  (relative)  level  of  investment  that 
determines (through changes in the fraction f) the share of investment and saving in aggregate output. 

4.2 

The average propensity to save and the Supermultiplier 

 
Let us now add the assumption that investment is an induced expenditure. In a first step, let us assume it is 

determined as a share of output: 

𝐼𝑡 = ℎ𝑌𝑡 

(

12), 

 
where ℎ is the propensity to invest that is exogenously given. Now the level of output is determined by the 
level  of  autonomous  consumption  and  a  Supermultiplier  that  takes  into  account  both  induced  consumption  and 
induced investment: 

𝑌𝑡 =

𝑍𝑡

 

13) 
Given the marginal propensity to save and the propensity to invest, effective demand and output will grow 
at  the  rate  𝑧  at  which  autonomous  consumption  grows.  In  this  case,  the  average  propensity  to  save  is  entirely 
determined  (for  any  value  strictly  below  the  marginal  propensity  to  save  𝑠)  by  the  propensity  to  invest.  Indeed, 
from equation (13) we get the share of autonomous consumption in output: 

𝑠 − ℎ

Replacing this latter result in equation (9) we obtain: 

𝑍𝑡
𝑌𝑡

= 𝑠 − ℎ 

𝑆𝑡
𝑌𝑡

= ℎ

Lavoie (2017), who call such expenditures “semi-autonomous”.

The Static or fundamental stability of the adjustment of capacity to demand  

Our Supermultiplier model allows us to rewrite equation (4) above as: 

8 

(

𝑧 =

𝑢 

ℎ
𝑣

16) 
Due to the presence of autonomous expenditures that do not create capacity and grow at an exogenous rate 
𝑧,  the  fact  that  investment  is  induced  in  the  sense  discussed  above  does  not  lead  to  fundamental  or  static 
instability  as  in  the  Harrodian  model.  In  fact,  contrary  to  what  happens  in  the  latter  model,  the  autonomous 
consumption  Supermultiplier  presented  here  is  fundamentally  or  statically  stable  in  Hicksian  terms,  since  the 
reaction of investors put the economy in the direction of the equilibrium point. In Harrod’s case, as seen above, if 
initially the growth rate of investment happens to be above the warranted rate 𝑠/𝑣, the actual degree of capacity 
utilization will be above its planned level and, conversely, if the rate of growth of investment happens to be lower 
than the warranted rate this will lead to a situation of underutilization of capacity. If investment follows the capital 
stock  adjustment  principle,  the  disequilibrium  process  drives  the  economy  away  from  the  equilibrium  point, 
because overutilization (underutilization) leads to a higher (lower) rate of growth of investment and this will, by 
its turn, make the actual degree of utilization increase (decrease) even further.12 

In  the  case  of  the  Sraffian  Supermultiplier  model,  growth  at  Harrod’s  warranted  rate  is  still  unstable 
because, as will see, that rate only determines  an upper limit to feasible demand-led rates of growth. But in this 
model, where the rate of growth of the trend of demand is given by the rate of growth of autonomous expenditures 
𝑧, growth at this rate is fundamentally or statically stable. Indeed, starting from a situation in which utilization is 
equal  to  its  planned  degree,  if  the  rate  of  growth  of  investment  𝑔𝐼𝑡  happens  to  be  initially  above  𝑧,  the  rate  of 
growth of aggregate demand will be lower than the growth of capacity, which will lead to an underutilization of 
capacity.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  rate  of  growth  of  investment  happens  to  be  below  the  rate  of  growth  of 
autonomous  demand,  demand  will  grow  by  more  than  investment,  and  this  will  lead  to  an  overutilization  of 
productive capacity.  

If  induced  investment  behaves  according  to  the  capital  stock adjustment  principle,  either  directly  by  the 
deviation of the actual degree of utilization from its planned degree, or by the effect of actually observed growth 
rates on the expected growth rate of the trend of demand (or both) this gives the signals in the right direction for 
the change in investment. In the case of underutilization (overutilization), there will be a tendency for investment 
to  grow  less  (more)  than  demand,  i.e.,  towards  a  lower  (higher)  investment  share  ℎ,  which  will  tend  to  make 
capacity grow by less (more) than demand. 

As an example, let us assume  that starting from a situation in which capacity and demand are balanced, 
there is a reduction in the rate of growth 𝑧 of autonomous consumption. This reduction will provoke a reduction 
to the same extent of the rate of growth of demand and output  𝑔 for given values of the marginal propensity to 
consume and of the investment share. The actual degree of capacity utilization will be reduced (leading to a value 
𝑢 < 1),  as  initially  aggregate  demand  will  start  to  grow  less  and  only  later  the  rate  of  growth  of  productive 
capacity  and  the  capital  stock  will  tend  to  expand  at  this  same  lower  rate  according  to  equation  (3).  The  lower 
growth of capacity will prevail when the capacity effect of the lower absolute rate of growth of investment, for the 
given propensity to invest, ℎ, materializes. Investment will grow at the same lower rate of growth as autonomous 
expenditures,  reducing  also  the  rate  of  growth  of  the  stock  of  capital.  When  the  rate  of  growth  of  the  stock  of 
capital  adapts  itself  to  this  lower  rate  of  growth  of  demand  and  output, the actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization 
will  stabilize  at  a  level  lower  than  the  planned  or  normal  degree,  according  to  equation  (16)  above  (i.e.,  𝑢 =
𝑣𝑧 ℎ⁄ ).  

However, it seems to be reasonable to assume that, over time, the investment share ℎ will itself be reduced 
to some extent as a response to the underutilization of capacity  and/or to a reduction of the actual rate of growth 

                                                           
12 Some authors (but not Harrod) have extended this idea of the warranted rate of growth for the case in which there are autonomous components in demand (𝑍). In 
this case  the  modified  warranted  rate  would be  equal to  𝑔𝑤 = (𝑠 − 𝑍/𝑌∗)/𝑣, the  ratio between the  average propensity  to  save  at a  position  in  which  capacity  is 
utilized at its planned degree and the normal capital-output ratio. This modified warranted rate would measure the potential rates of growth of capacity saving, and, 
in general, is not constant over time, as 𝑍/𝑌 could only remain constant in case the rate of growth of autonomous consumption by chance happened to be equal to 
the  rate  of  growth  of  capacity  output.  For  references  and  a  detailed  analysis  of  this  modified  warranted  rate  and  the  confusion  between  this  supply  side  rate  of 
growth with the demand led Sraffian Supermultiplier see Freitas & Serrano (2015). 

 
of demand. This gradual reduction of the propensity to invest13 will have two effects. First, it will further reduce 
the  growth  of  aggregate  demand  and  output,  lowering,  even  more,  the  actual  degree  of  capacity  utilization. 
Nevertheless,  later  on,  the  lower  investment  share  will  reduce  the  rates  of  growth  of  the  capital  stock  and 
productive capacity. The presence of autonomous consumption demand growing at an exogenous rate  𝑧 implies 
that the  rate  of  growth  of  aggregate  demand  and  output  will  fall  proportionately  less  than  the  rate  of  growth  of 
investment (for otherwise the investment share could not have fallen). The ensuing reduction in the rate of growth 
of capacity and of capital stock will be equal to the fall in the rate of growth of investment.  This means that the 
actual degree of capacity utilization will eventually start to rise, because, while aggregate demand is growing at a 
slower pace than before, the final reduction of the rate of growth of the capital stock is even greater (something 
that would be impossible without the presence of autonomous consumption). 

9 

The process described above will continue to work  as long as the actual degree of capacity utilization is 
below the planned degree. It will only stop when the investment share ℎ has been sufficiently reduced to a level 
that would allow that, at the planned degree of capacity utilization, the rate of growth of the  capital stock is fully 
adapted  to  the  lower  rate  of  growth  of  autonomous  consumption.  However,  depending  on  the  value  of  the 
parameters  defining  the  intensity  of  the  reaction  of  investment  to  demand  growth  and/or  the  gap  in  capacity 
utilization,  this  adjustment  process  may  overshoot  and  cause  a  cyclical  adjustment.  If  the  resulting  cycle  were 
dampened, this would not cause any problem. But that will depend, as we shall see below, on the conditions for 
dynamic, not static, stability. 

Symmetrically,  the  same  process  of  adjustment  of  the  propensity  to  invest  occurs  in  the  case  of  a 
permanent  increase  in  the  rate  of  growth  of  autonomous  consumption  𝑧.  We  would  then  have  an  initial 
overutilization  of  capacity  and,  gradual  increases  in  the  investment  share  ℎ  that  first  would  increase  further  the 
degree  of  overutilization.  However,  the  higher  investment  share  will  eventually  make  the  capital  stock  and  the 
productive capacity grow at a faster pace than the aggregate demand and output. As a result,  the actual degree of 
capacity  utilization  would  gradually  fall  back  to  its  planned  degree  either  monotonically  or  through  dampened 
cyclical oscillations, and the level and rate of growth of the productive capacity of the economy will adapt itself to 
the permanently higher rate of growth of autonomous demand 𝑧.  

The crucial point is that the process of growth led by the expansion  of autonomous consumption is thus 
fundamentally or statically stable. This is so because the reaction of induced investment to the initial imbalance 
between capacity and demand has, at some point during the disequilibrium process, a greater impact on the rate of 
growth of productive capacity than on the rate of growth of demand. Thus, in the case of an initial underutilization 
(overutilization) of capacity, the consequent reduction (increase) in the rate of growth of investment in relation to 
the  growth  rate  of  demand  and  output  eventually  leads  to  a  situation  in  which  the  rate  of  growth  of  the  capital 
stock (and capacity) is lower (higher) than the rate of growth of demand/output. The operation of the capital stock 
adjustment principle combined with the existence of an autonomously growing non-capacity creating expenditure 
reverts  the  initial  tendency  towards  an  increasing  deviation  between  actual  and  planned  degrees  of  capacity 
utilization. In this sense, we may say that disequilibrium process in the Sraffian Supermultiplier model goes in the 
correct direction. 

In  the  Harrodian  model  this  reaction  always  causes  instability  because,  without  the  autonomous 
consumption component (𝑍 = 0), the rate of growth of demand and output always changes by exactly the same 
amount  as  the  rate  of  growth  of  investment.  Given  income  distribution,  the  lack  of  autonomous  consumption 
demand ensures that no matter how much the levels of investment change, the investment share cannot change, 
since  it  is  uniquely  determined  by  the  marginal  propensity  to  save 𝑠  in  the Harrodian  model.  In  contrast,  in  the 
Sraffian Supermultiplier, the average propensity to save is entirely determined by the propensity to invest decided 
by firms. If the latter increases (decreases) with overutilization (underutilization) and/or with increases (decreases) 
in the rate of growth of aggregate demand, the same occurs with the average propensity to save (𝑆/𝑌), that adjusts 
itself to the investment share that is required to adjust the level and growth rate of capacity to that of demand. In 
equation (11) above, given 𝑠 and 𝑣, changes in the propensity to invest ℎ modify the “fraction” 𝑓 = [𝐼/(𝐼 + 𝑍)], 

                                                           
13 The central idea is that investors attempt to adjust the size of the capital stock to the trend level of demand. This implies that the investment share will respond to 
changes in the expected demand trend to situations of over/underutilization of capacity or to both. There are many forms to represent this process in simple terms in 
Supermultiplier models. One option is to assume that the investment share reacts linearly to discrepancies between the actual and the planned degree of capacity 
utilization, as done in Freitas & Serrano (2015) and Serrano & Freitas (2017). Here we adopt a different specification in which the investment share reacts linearly 
to the revisions on the expected trend rate of growth of demand, as suggested in Cesaratto, Serrano & Stirati (2003).

to  the  extent  that  is  necessary  for  the  economy  to  endogenously  generate  the  saving  ratio  required  by  the 
expansion of aggregate demand, leading to the tendency of the degree of capacity utilization towards its planned 
degree  (𝑢 = 1).  In  this  sense,  if  we  were  to  reinterpret  the  “warranted  rate  of  growth”  as  the  ratio  between 
average propensity to save and normal capital-output ratio (see note 14 above), in the Supermultiplier model, it is 
the “warranted rate” that would adjust itself to the actual rate of growth through changes in the  average (but not 
the  marginal)  propensity  to  save,  triggered  by  induced  variations  in  the  investment  share.  The  upshot  of  our 
analysis  is  that  the  “marriage”  between  the  “accelerator”  and  the  “multiplier”  can  in  principle  indeed  be 
consummated, but only if a third element, autonomous expenditures that do not create capacity, is present. 

 

4.4 

Dynamic Stability and the limits to demand-led growth 

 
In the discussion of the adjustment of capacity to demand above we have alluded to the idea of a gradual 
adjustment of the propensity to invest in relation to discrepancies between the actual (𝑢) and the planned degree 
(𝑢 = 1) of capacity utilization. The reason for this is that the fundamental or static stability of the adjustment of 
capacity to demand is certainly a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the viability of a demand-led growth 
regime described by the the Sraffian Supermultiplier. The partial or gradual adjustment of the investment share is 
what is required to provide a set of sufficient conditions for the dynamic stability of the whole process.  

If,  for  instance,  given  an  increase  in  the  growth  rate  of  autonomous  consumption  𝑧  and  the  consequent 
increase  in the  rate  of  growth  of  aggregate  demand  and  of  the  ensuing  overutilization  of  capacity,  the  marginal 
propensity  to  invest  reacts  too  intensely  and  increases  too  much,  it  is  possible  that  the  whole  process  of 
adjustment  of  capacity  to  demand  becomes  dynamically  unstable.  This  is  so,  because,  although  the  process  is 
going in the right direction, its intensity may be excessive if induced investment increases too much. In fact, if the 
increase in the investment share is sufficiently large, the consequent growth of aggregate demand may become so 
high that it may be impossible to increase the supply of output at such a rate. Formally, it is easy to see that if the 
propensity to invest ℎ when added to the marginal propensity to consume  1 − 𝑠 becomes greater than one, then 
any  positive  level  of  autonomous  consumption  demand  will  induce  an  infinite  total  level  of  aggregate  demand, 
which is, of course, impossible to meet with increases in output. The dynamic stability of the related to the model 
requires  that  this  situation  does  not  occur.  This  is  why  the  model  requires  the  additional  assumption  that  the 
changes  of  the  propensity  to  invest  induced  by  the  changes  in  the  actual  growth  rates  of  demand  and/or  in  the 
deviations from the planned degree of utilization should be gradual. 

This  idea  of  a  partial  or  gradual  adjustment  can  be  illustrated  by  a  version  of  the  model  in  which  the 
investment share depends only on the technical normal capital-output ratio and the expected rate of growth of the 
trend of aggregate demand 𝑔𝑒. The central point is that the investment share does not depend only on the actual 
rate of growth 𝑔𝑡−1 observed in the most recent period (as in the so called “rigid” accelerator) but on the expected 
trend of demand growth over the life of the new capital equipment. When the actual rate of growth of aggregate 
demand  𝑔  changes,  the  expected  trend  rate  of  growth  of  demand  𝑔𝑒  will  be  revised,  but  only  partially  and 
gradually.  This  is  so  because  firms  understand  both  that  demand  is  subject  to  fluctuations  that  may  not  be 
permanent and that in an economy that uses fixed capital equipment, the purpose of firms is to adjust capacity to 
demand over the lifetime of the equipment and not at each moment in time. This gradual or partial adjustment of 
demand expectations is known as the “flexible accelerator” as opposed to the “rigid accelerator” in which firms 
try  to  adapt  capacity  to  demand  immediately  and  treat  all  changes  in  demand  as  permanent.  Thus,  the  gradual 
adjustment of the propensity to invest can be represented as follows: 

𝑒 
ℎ𝑡 = 𝑣𝑔𝑡

𝑒 = 𝑔𝑡−1
𝑔𝑡

𝑒 + 𝛽(𝑔𝑡−1 − 𝑔𝑡−1

𝑒

) 

17), 

(

(

18), 
where  0 ≤ 𝛽 ≤ 1  is  an  adjustment  parameter  in  the  equation  of  (adaptive)  expectation  formation.  Of 
course,  𝛽 = 0  would  mean  that  the  investment  share  is  exogenous,  in  which  case  we  would  obtain  the 
Supermultiplier  model  with  a  given  propensity  to  invest  analyzed  above.  On  the  other  hand,  𝛽 = 1  would 
represent the case of the “rigid accelerator”. Finally, a positive and small 𝛽 being the more realistic case of the 
“flexible accelerator”.

Mathematically (see Appendix B below for details), a sufficient condition for the dynamic stability of the 
discrete time Sraffian Supermultiplier is that the aggregate marginal propensity to spend, both in consumption and 
investment,  has  to  remain  lower  than  one  during  the  adjustment  process,  in  which  the  marginal  propensity  to 
invest will naturally be changing. In the analysis of this condition we must take into account the investment share 
permanently  induced  or  required  by  the  trend  rate  of  growth  of  the  economy  𝑣𝑧,  the  marginal  change  in  the 
investment  share  induced  by  the  revision  of  the  expected  trend  of  growth  𝑣𝛽  out  of  equilibrium  and  the 
interaction  term  involving  the  two  previous  terms,  𝑣𝛽𝑧.  For  the  stability  condition  to  be  met,  the  sum  of  these 
components must be lower than the marginal propensity to save 𝑠:14 

19) 
From the above condition, we can show that, for a given value of 𝛽, there is a well-defined upper bound to 
what  can  be  characterized  as  a  demand-led  growth  regime.  This  limit  shows  that  the  economy  is  in  a  proper 
demand-led regime only if the growth rate of autonomous demand 𝑧 is not “too high”, namely if: 

𝑣𝑧 + 𝑣𝛽 + 𝑣𝛽𝑧 < 𝑠 

𝑧 < (

𝑠
𝑣

− 𝛽)

1

1 + 𝛽

 

20) 

 
If  condition  (19)  is  met  and  the  equilibrium  of  the  Sraffian  Supermultiplier  is  dynamically  stable,  there 
will  be  a  tendency  for  the  investment  share  to  adjust  itself  to  the  value  required  by  the  trend  rate  of  growth  of 
demand,  which  of  course  will  be  equal  to  and  determined  by  the  rate  of  growth  of  autonomous  consumption 𝑧 
(𝑔𝑒 = 𝑔∗ = 𝑧): 

ℎ∗ = 𝑣𝑧

Therefore,  there  is  a  tendency  for  the  levels  of  capacity  output  to  follow  the  evolution  of  the  trend  of 
effective demand and for the rate of growth of demand to be led by the expansion of the autonomous expenditures

The  research  based  on  the  Sraffian  Supermultiplier  was  set  out  to  determine  under  which  conditions 
growth  could  be  unambiguously  demand-led  under  exogenous  distribution  and  with  investors  driven  to  adjust 
capacity to demand. Three such conditions were found to be required. The first is the existence of an autonomous 
component in aggregate demand that does not create capacity for the private business sector of the economy. The 
second  was  that  investment  must  be  induced  by  the  capital  stock  adjustment  principle.  The  third  is  that,  in  the 
adjustment of capacity to demand, the further amount of induced consumption and investment generated should 
not be excessive (i.e., infinite). This third condition has two elements. First, one structural element is that the rate 
of  growth  of  autonomous  demand  must  be  lower  than  Harrod’s  warranted  rate  𝑠/𝑣  as  the  share  of  required 
induced  investment  to  meet  the  expansion  of  autonomous  demand  𝑣𝑧  must  be  permanently  lower  than  the 
marginal propensity to save 𝑠, which implies that 𝑧 < 𝑠/𝑣. The second element is due to the fact that room must 
be made also for the extra induced investment that is necessary to bring the economy back to the planned degree 
of  capacity  utilization  when  it  deviates  from  it  during  the  adjustment  process  (i.e.,  𝑣𝛽).  Including  this  second 
element (and its interaction with the first one) we get a lower maximum rate of demand-led growth, described by 
equation (20) above (i.e., we have (𝑠 𝑣⁄ − 𝛽)(1 [1 + 𝛽]

) < 𝑠 𝑣⁄  for 𝛽 > 0).

Note however that this more stringent condition (20), while sufficient, is not strictly necessary and could 
be relaxed to some extent if some of the model parameters were variable. This relaxation could be accomplished 
                                                           
14  Existing  proofs  of  the  dynamic  stability  of  the  Sraffian  Supermultiplier  by  Freitas  &  Serrano  (2015),  Pariboni  (2015),  Dutt  (2015)  and  Allain  (2015)  use 
continuous time and are equivalent to 𝑣𝑧 + 𝑣𝛽 < 𝑠. In discrete time we see that we have to add the interaction term 𝑣𝛽𝑧 to the marginal propensity to invest. Note 
also that this condition shows that the usual stability conditions for trendless multiplier-accelerator models of business cycles in which autonomous demand remains 
constant, namely, 𝑣𝛽 < 𝑠 appear here as a special case of equation (19), by setting 𝑧 equal to zero.

if we assume that the marginal propensity to spend happens to be higher than one in the vicinity of the position 
where capacity is fully adjusted to demand, but then becomes lower than one again when the economy is further 
away  from  that  position,  generating  a  limit  cycle.  There  are  many  reasons  for  these  type  of  assumptions,  some 
reasonable,  some  quite  arbitrary  and  implausible.  Some  of  these  possibilities  will  be  the  subject  of  further 
research. But it is important to note that the structural character of the third condition above related to the fact that 
the maximum rate of demand-led growth must be lower than Harrod’s warranted rate15 simply cannot be relaxed, 
for it is a necessary condition. In this sense, from the standpoint of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model, Harrod’s 
warranted  rate  of  growth  has  to  be  reinterpreted  as  an  upper-limit  for  a  demand-led  growth  process  compatible 
with a normal degree of capacity utilization. 

5  DISCUSSION OF THE LITERATURE 

 

5.1 

On  Harrodian instability 

 
We  have  shown  above  that  the  fundamental  instability  of  Harrod’s  warranted  rate  is  valid  under  very 
general conditions. We argued that Harrodian instability is a case of static instability, in the sense of Hicks (1965), 
as  the  adjustment  goes  in  the  opposite  direction  in  relation  to  the  equilibrium  position,  independently  of  the 
magnitude of the reaction parameter 𝛼. 

These quite general results stand in sharp contrast with a recent contribution by Trezzini (2017), where he 
explicitly  argues  that  the  “the  cornerstone  of  Harrodian  instability”  (Trezzini,  2017,  p.2)  is  the  intensity  of  the 
reaction of invest to demand: “the assumption of the elasticity of investment to any divergence between actual and 
planned utilization must be reconsidered. As the concept of Harrodian instability is based on this assumption, it 
appears  to  lose  most  if  not  all  of  its  relevance”  (Trezzini,  2017,  pp.  21-22).  As  we  saw  in  section  3  above  and 
confirmed in appendix A below, Harrodian instability is fundamental or static precisely because it depends only 
on  the  sign  but  not  on  the  magnitude  of  the  reaction  of  investment  to  demand  or  to  the  deviation  of  capacity 
utilization from its planned level. Low reaction coefficients will certainly not prevent the instability of economic 
growth at Harrod’s warranted rate. 

Our results also make us somewhat skeptical of Setterfield (2016) claim that the canonical Neo-Kaleckian 
model  may  avoid  Harrodian  instability  if  investment  only  reacts  to large  deviations  from  the  planned  degree  of 
utilization. The argument is developed as if investment is done by a single firm and it is not clear that it could be 
generalized to a number of different firms. To us it seems reasonable to think that if only a few  firms experience 
underutilization  (or  overutilization)  of  its  capacity  large  enough  to  trigger  the  proper  capital  stock  adjustment 
principle, then a process of reduction (increase) in induced investment would quickly drag the degree of capacity 
utilization of other firms outside their tolerance bands and joint in the explosive contraction (expansion). In any 
case,  even  if  aggregate  investment  does  not  react  to  discrepancies  between  capacity  and  demand,  it  would  be 
growth  at  the  rate  determined  by  the  pace  of  capital  accumulation  as  given  by  the  Neo-Kaleckian  investment 
function and not growth at Harrod’s warranted rate, that could be considered stable.  

Our results on Harrodian instability also differ from a claim made by Dejuán (2016). The author uses his 
variant of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model that has an autonomous component that does not create capacity and 
thus, as we have seen above does not suffer from Harrod’s fundamental or static instability. He does make further 
assumptions  that  firms  immediately  adjust  the  propensity  to  invest  to  the  trend  rate  of  growth  of  autonomous 
demand and perform temporary levels of investment to deal with initial under or overutilization of capacity. These 
latter  “ancilliary”  investments,  according  to  him,  have  no  further  accelerator  effects  as  they  do  not  affect  the 
expected  trend  rate  of  growth.  The  author  is  correct  in  attributing  the  strong  (dynamic)  stability  of  his  own 
Supermultiplier  model to these (in our view unrealistic) assumptions that firms know how to distinguish clearly 
permanent  from  temporary  changes  in  demand  and  also  know  that  the  trend  of  the  economy  depends  on  the 
growth of autonomous demand component.  However, he also argues that: “[t]he absence of proper autonomous 
demand in Harrod’s model hindered the structural way out. But even in his simple model, stability would prevail 
if  it  were  not  for  the bizarre  reaction  function  bestowed  on  investors” that  “links  investment  both  to permanent 
and  transient  demand;”  (DeJuán,  2016,  p.  22).  Here  he  claims  that  his  assumptions  on  the  ability  of  firms  to 
distinguish  between  permanent  and  transient  changes  in  demand  would  be  sufficient  to  ensure  that  “stability 

                                                           
15 This is the maximum rate of growth proposed initially by Serrano (1995a, 1995b).

would  prevail”  in  the  Harrodian  model  without  autonomous  demand.  But  what  would  be  “stable”  in  such 
circumstances,  and  in  the  mere  sense  of  being  constant  over  time,  would  be  the  actual  rate  of  growth  of 
investment, which would not change given the assumed inelasticity of demand expectations. As he readily admits, 
this  actual  rate  of  growth  would  be  different  from  Harrod’s  warranted  rate  and  the  actual  degree  of  capacity 
utilization  would  correspondingly  be  permanently  different  from  its  planned  level.  Therefore,  despite his  claim, 
DeJuán  (2016)  analysis  is  not  really  capable  to  deny  that  growth  at  Harrod’s  warranted  rate  is  fundamentally 
unstable, if investment is allowed to respond to demand or to the deviation of capacity utilization from its planned 
degree.  

On  the  other  hand,  our  results  allows  us  to  understand  the  analytical  properties  of  Harrodian  models  in 
which  growth  at  the  warranted  rate  s/v  is  made  to  become  dynamically  stable.  In  such  models  static  Harrodian 
instability  is  avoided  by  making  explicit  assumptions  that  either  economic  policy  (Dumenil  &  Levy,  1999, 
Franke, 2017), or the reaction of private investment to labor market conditions (Skott, 2010), is such as to reverse 
the sign of the response of investment based on the capital stock adjustment principle. For instance, Franke (2017, 
p.10) recognizes that in order for one to be “Keynesian or Kaleckian in the short run but classical in the long run” 
one would need that the sign of the total reaction of the growth of investment to the deviation between the actual 
and the planned degree of utilization should be negative. In our terms this can occur only if 𝛼 < 0. 16 

 

5.2 

On the dynamic stability of the supermultiplier  

 
Franke  (2017)  has  also  argued  that  even  a  dynamically  stable  adjustment  of  capacity  to  demand  via  a 
flexible accelerator Supermultiplier can be made unstable, if combined with another adjustment process such as 
those  used  to  stabilize  growth  at  Harrod’s  warranted  rate.  But  we  know  (see  footnote  12  above)  that  the  latter 
adjustment  process  implies  that  the  rate  of  growth  of  investment  increases  when  the  degree  of  utilization  falls 
below the planned level (and decreases with overutilization). Thus in the context of the Sraffian Supermultiplier if 
this  added  effect  is  sufficiently  strong  it  could  counteract  the  capital  stock  adjustment  principle  and  would  be 
equivalent  to  assuming  a  negative  value  for  the  reaction  of  investment to  demand  parameter  𝛽. We  do  not  find 
that  the  assumptions  leading  to  this  result  to  be  plausible,  but,  in  any  case,  it  should  be  noted  that  under  such 
extreme  circumstances  it  would  be  the  Sraffian  Supermultiplier  that  would  become  statically  unstable  as  the 
adjustment process would be clearly going in the wrong direction. 

The conditions for the static and dynamic stability of the autonomous demand-led supermultiplier growth 
model has been misunderstood by Dávila-Fernández et all (2017) who attempt to criticize the model arguing that 
the mere presence of an autonomous component of demand is not sufficient to ensure the  stability of the process 
of  adjustment  of  capacity  to  demand.  As  pointed  out  by  Lavoie  (2017)  no  such  claim  was  ever  made  by  the 
proponents  of  such  models.  The  critique  shows  a  lack  of  understanding  that  even  the  static  stability  of  the 
supermultiplier  requires  both  that  there  is  an  autonomous  component  in  demand  and  capacity  generating 
investment follows the capital stock adjustment principle. And that the sufficient condition for dynamic stability 
(as  shown  in  section  4  and  proved  in  appendix  B)  depends  on  a    gradual  or  partial  reaction  of  the  investment 
share.  

Recently,  some  Neo-Kaleckian  authors  have  used  the  adjustment  mechanism  of  the  Sraffian 
Supermultiplier,  with  autonomous  demand  allowing  the  endogenous  adjustment  of  the  investment  share  to  its 
required  value  through  changes  in  the  ratio  between  the  average  and  marginal  propensity  to  save,  in  order  to 
tackle  what  they  call  the  “Harrodian  instability”  of  their  original  demand-led  growth  models  (Allain,  2015  and 
Lavoie,  2016).  These  authors  are  correct  in  considering  that  Neo-Kaleckian  models  without  autonomous  non-
capacity creating demand are subject to Harrodian  instability if investment is allowed to follow the capital stock 
adjustment  principle  consistently.  They  are  also  correct  in  seeing  that,  in  models  that  do  include  such  an 
autonomous  demand  component,  the  equilibrium  can  be  dynamically  stable  if  the  reaction  of  investment  to 
demand  is  not  excessive.  The  problem  of  the  traditional  Neo-Kaleckian  models  without  non-capacity  creating 
autonomous demand is indeed one of Harrod’s  fundamental or static instability. That is why instability depends 
only on the sign of the parameters and not on its magnitude. However, in the case of their Supermultiplier type of 
models,  the  notion  of  Harrodian  (fundamental)  instability  does  not  apply.  The  long  run  (fully  adjusted) 

                                                           
16 In this respect, see also Dutt (2011) and Hein et all (2012). 

 

14 

equilibrium  of  these  models  can  of  course  also  be  unstable  if  the  reaction  of  investment  is  too  strong. 
Nevertheless,  if  this  happens  to  be  the  case,  it  is  a  matter  of  dynamic,  not  static  or  fundamental  instability. 
Moreover, as the dynamic stability condition for the Supermultiplier is directly related to the requirement of the 
marginal propensity to spend to be lower than one during the adjustment process, it is clearly a variant of what the 
Neo-Kaleckians  call  “Keynesian  instability”  (marginal  propensity  to  invest  lower  than  marginal  propensity  to 
save) instead of “Harrodian instability”. We thus think that the notion of Harrodian instability should be used only 
in  demand-led  models  without  autonomous  demand,  where  the  investment  share  is  determined  by  a  given 
marginal  propensity  to  save.17  It  should  not  be  applied  to  Supermultiplier  models  (whether  of  Sraffian  or  Neo-
Kaleckian inspiration) to avoid confusing the necessary conditions of fundamental or static stability with those of 
the sufficient conditions of dynamic stability.18  

 

6  FINAL REMARKS 

 
The  upshot  of  our  analysis  in  this  paper  is  that,  after  all,  Harrod’s  principle  of  fundamental  (or  static) 
instability  of  his  warranted  rate  is  valid  under  very  general  conditions,  but  should  not  be  seen  as  a  “problem”. 
Given  the  fact  that  the  warranted  rate  𝑠/𝑣  is,  at  best,  an  upper  limit  of  feasible  rates  of  demand-led  growth  of 
capacity output, there is indeed no reason for such a rate of growth to be stable. This is so, because there is no 
reason  for  investors  following  market  signals  in  a  decentralized  monetary  capitalist  economy  to  make  the 
economy expand along a path described by Harrod’s warranted rate. So we do not think it is either theoretically 
fruitful  or  realistic  (given  that  we  would  have  had  to  assume  a  completely  implausible  positive  reaction  of 
investment to underutilization) to try to stabilize growth at Harrod’s warranted rate. 

The  latter  result,  however,  does  not  imply  that  the  multiplier-accelerator  interaction  in  the  analysis  of 
growing economies is, in general, fundamentally unstable. Quite the contrary, if there is an autonomous demand 
component  that  does  not  create  capacity  in  the  model,  as  shown  by  the  Sraffian  Supermultiplier,  demand-led 
growth at the rate at which this component grows is fundamentally (or statically) stable. We also argue that the 
latter result follows from assumptions about the non-capacity creating expenditures and not from those about the 
investment  function.  However,  although  the  adjustment  is  fundamentally  stable,  assumptions  on  the  investment 
function, in particular, that of a gradual or flexible accelerator, are relevant because, if the accelerator effect is too 
strong  (as  measured  by  a  high  value  for  the  reaction  parameter  𝛽)  the  model  may  nevertheless  be  dynamically 
unstable.  This  does  not  reduce  in  our  view  the  relevance  of  the  Sraffian  Supermultiplier  model,  as  we  do  think 
that for both theoretical and empirical reasons, a flexible accelerator moderate reaction of the investment share to 
demand is a reasonable assumption.19

APPENDIX A: On the Fundamental or Static Instability of Growth at Harrod’s Warranted Rate  

 
We start from the equations for the determination of the level of output and the rate of growth of investment: 

and 

𝑌𝑡 =

𝐼𝑡
𝑠

 

𝑔𝐼𝑡 = 𝑔𝐼𝑡−1 + 𝛼(𝑢𝑡−1 − 1) 

with the reaction parameter 𝛼 > 0 in accordance with the capital stock adjustment principle.  
Next, we take the growth rate of the capital stock given by: 

(A.1) 

(A.2) 

(A.3) 

𝑔𝐾𝑡+1 =

𝑢𝑡 =

𝑢𝑡 

ℎ𝑡
𝑣

𝑠
𝑣

where ℎ𝑡 = 𝐼𝑡 𝑌𝑡⁄  is the investment share, which is equal to and determined by the exogenous marginal propensity 
to save 𝑠. 
The following difference equation gives the dynamics of the actual degree of capacity utilization: 

𝑢𝑡 = 𝑢𝑡−1 (

1 + 𝑔𝑡
1 + 𝑔𝐾𝑡

) 

(A.4) 

Since  the  marginal  propensity  to  save  is  an  exogenous  variable,  it  follows  from  equation  (A.1)  that  the  rate  of 
growth of output is equal to the growth rate of investment: 
𝑔𝑡 = 𝑔𝐼𝑡 

(A.5) 

Therefore, from the equations above, we obtain the following system: 

𝑔𝑡 = 𝑔𝑡−1 + 𝛼(𝑢𝑡−1 − 1) 

In equilibrium, we have 𝑢𝑡 = 𝑢𝑡−1 = 𝑢∗ and 𝑔𝑡 = 𝑔𝑡−1 = 𝑔∗. Therefore, the system yields: 

𝑢𝑡 = 𝑢𝑡−1 (

1 + 𝑔𝑡−1 + 𝛼(𝑢𝑡−1 − 1)

) 

1 + (

𝑠
𝑣) 𝑢𝑡−1

𝑢∗ = 1 

(A.6) 

(A.7) 

(A.8) 

 

𝑔∗ = 𝑔𝐼

∗ = 𝑔𝐾

∗ =

𝑠
𝑣

 

17 

(A.9) 

Thus,  along  the  equilibrium  path,  we  have  normal  capacity  utilization  and  growth  at  Harrod’s  warranted  rate, 
which is a supply (capacity) constrained growth rate.  
We  shall  now  investigate  the  stability  of  the  Harrodian  equilibrium.  Evaluated  at  the  equilibrium  point,  the 
Jacobian matrix is:

which is also satisfied since the three terms on the left-hand side of the above inequality have a positive value. 
The second condition is not satisfied. To see why, from the condition under analysis we obtain: 

𝛼 < 0 

(A.15) 

However,  according  to  the  capital  stock  adjustment  principle,  the  value  of  𝛼  is  clearly  positive.  Therefore,  the 
positive  sign  of  the  𝛼  parameter  is  a  sufficient  condition  for  the  instability  of  the  Harrodian  equilibrium. 
Moreover, the latter equilibrium is unstable in a strong sense, since the instability depends only on the sign of the 
reaction parameter and not on its magnitude. In this sense, the Harrodian equilibrium is indeed characterized by a 
fundamental, or static (in Hicksian terms) instability.  
 
APPENDIX B: On the dynamic stability of a discrete time Sraffian Supermultiplier 
The basic equations of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model in terms of discrete time are the following: 
 

𝑍𝑡

𝑌𝑡 =

𝑒 
𝑠 − 𝑣𝑔𝑡
𝑒𝑌𝑡 

𝐼𝑡 = 𝑣𝑔𝑡

𝑒 = 𝛽𝑔𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝛽)𝑔𝑡−1
𝑔𝑡

𝑒

 

𝑒 
𝑔𝐾𝑡+1 = 𝑢𝑡𝑔𝑡

(B.1) 

(B.2) 

(B.3) 

(B.4) 

 

Based on the equations above, we can obtain a system of difference equations in 𝑔 and 𝑔𝑒: 

𝑢𝑡 = (

) 𝑢𝑡−1 

1 + 𝑔𝑡
1 + 𝑔𝐾𝑡

𝑔𝑡 = 𝑧 +

𝑣(1 + 𝑧)𝛽(𝑔𝑡−1 − 𝑔𝑡−1

𝑒 = 𝛽𝑔𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝛽)𝑔𝑡−1
𝑔𝑡

𝑒

(B.5) 

(B.6) 

(B.7) 

 
𝑒 = 𝑔𝑒, which from equations (B.6) and (B.7) implies 
The equilibrium is given by 𝑔𝑡 = 𝑔𝑡−1 = 𝑔∗ and 𝑔𝑡
that in equilibrium we have that the rate growth of autonomous consumption determines the equilibrium rate of 
growth of output and expected rate of of growth of demand (i.e., 𝑔𝑒 = 𝑔∗ = 𝑧). Further, from equation (B.5), in 
order to obtain a stationary value for the degree of capacity utilization (i.e., for 𝑢𝑡 = 𝑢𝑡−1 = 𝑢∗) we need the rate 
∗ ). Thus, the rate of growth of 
of growth of output to be equal to the rate of growth of the capital stock (i.e. 𝑔∗ = 𝑔𝐾
autonomous  consumption  also  determines  the  rate  of  growth  of  the  capital  stock  and  productive  capacity.  As  a 
result, we obtain: 

𝑒 = 𝑔𝑡−1

𝑔𝑒 = 𝑔𝐾

∗ = 𝑔∗ = 𝑧 

(B.8) 

Therefore, contrary to what happens in the Harrodian growth model, the Supermultiplier model exhibits a demand 
(consumption) led pattern of economic growth.  

Finally,  from  equations  (B.4)  and  (B.8)  we  can  determine  the  equilibrium  value  of  the  degree  of  capacity 
utilization as:  

𝑢∗ = 1 

(B.9) 

The  latter  result  shows  that  in  equilibrium  capacity  fully  adjusts  to  demand  at  the  planned  or  normal  degree  of 
capacity utilization.  

As for the analysis of the stability of the equilibrium, the Jacobian matrix of the dynamic system evaluated at the 
equilibrium point is: 

𝐉∗ =

From (B.10), we can obtain the values of the trace and determinant of the Jacobian:

𝑣(1 + 𝑧)𝛽

(B.12) 

Again, the stability conditions involving the trace and determinant of the Jacobian matrix are the following: 20  
 

                                                           
20 Note that these conditions are different from the trace and determinant conditions used so far in the analysis of the stability of the 
steady-state  of  Supermultiplier  growth  models  (cf.,  Freitas  &  Serrano,  2015;  Allain,  2015;  Dutt,  2015;  and  Pariboni, 2015). The 
reason is that, instead of the continuous time, we are here in a discrete time setting. In a continuous time analysis, stability requires 
that  the  real  characteristic  roots  are  negative  and  that  the  complex  roots  have  negative  real  parts,  a  condition  on  the  sign  of  the 
eigenvalues  of  the  Jacobian  matrix  of  the  dynamical  system.  On  the  other  hand,  in  discrete  time  dynamical  systems,  the 
requirement  is  for  characteristic  roots  with  absolute  values  (moduli)  smaller  than  one,  a  restriction  on  the  magnitude  of  the 
eigenvalues of Jacobian matrix. The three inequalities below are derived from the Schur stability  conditions in the case of a 2X2 
system and guarantee that the (real or complex) eigenvalues obey the required conditions. In this respect, see Gandolfo (1997, pp. 
58-59), Sydsaeter et alli (2005, pp. 404-405 and pp. 410-411), and Galor (2007, pp. 96-105).

1 − 𝐓𝐫(𝐉∗) + 𝐃𝐞𝐭(𝐉∗) > 0 

1 + 𝐓𝐫(𝐉∗) + 𝐃𝐞𝐭(𝐉∗) > 0 

From the last condition, we have that: 

2 − 𝛽 +

Since  from  the  assumptions  of  the  Sraffian  Supermultiplier  model  we  have  0 < 𝛽 < 1  and  𝑣, 𝑧, 𝑠 > 0,  thus 
inequality (B.13) holds if 𝑠 − 𝑣𝑧 > 0 or: 

𝑧 <

 

(B.14). 

Inequality  (B.14) shows that a  necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the stability of the equilibrium of the 
model is that the rate of growth of autonomous consumption must be lower than the Harrodian warranted rate of 
growth  and  the  latter  is  an  upper-limit  to  a  demand-led  growth  process  with  normal  utilization  of  productive 
capacity. 
Next, from the second condition we obtain: 

𝛽 > 0 

(B.15). 

This  condition  is  met  since,  as  we  already  pointed  out,  the  adjustment  parameter  𝛽  assumes  values  within  the 
interval 0 < 𝛽 < 1. 
Finally, from the first stability condition above, we obtain: 

or

(B.17). 

Inequalities (B.16) and (B.17) correspond, respectively, to inequalities (19) and (20) in the text. They represent, in 
two alternative ways, the sufficient condition for dynamic stability of the equilibrium of the Supermultiplier model 
that we analyze here. Inequality (B.16) represents the stability condition in the form of a generalized Keynesian 
stability  condition  that  says  that  the  equilibrium  is  stable  whenever  the  disequilibrium  marginal  propensity  to 
invest  is  smaller  than  the  marginal  propensity  to  save.  On  the  other  hand,  inequality  (B.17)  says  that  a  stable 
demand-led  growth  path  is  possible  whenever  the  rate  of  growth  of  autonomous  consumption  is  below  a 
maximum  rate  of  growth  expressed  by  the  term  on  the  right-hand  side  of  the  inequality.  Note  also  that,  for 
positive  values  of  𝛽,  we  have  the  following  set  of  inequalities  that  represent  the  necessary  and  sufficient 
conditions for the stability of the equilibrium:
