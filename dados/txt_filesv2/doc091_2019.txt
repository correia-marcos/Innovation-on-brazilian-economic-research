ABSTRACT 

Many  scholars  have  highlighted  the  role  of  infrastructure  in  reducing  income  inequality.  Developing 
economies  present  immense  regional  and  income  discrepancies,  which  are  correlated  with  unequally 
distributed  infrastructure  in  territorial  and  population  terms.  In  this  paper,  we  assess  the  effects  of 
infrastructure  supply  on  income  inequality  and  verify  whether  these  effects  vary  according  to  the 
infrastructure  sector  and  its  degree  of  quality  and  access  in  Brazil.  The  analysis  is  based  on  spatial 
hierarchical models. Results allow us to say that infrastructure correlates negatively with income inequality. 
Hence, policies aimed at improving infrastructure quality and  expanding access  are crucial for  reducing 
income concentration.

RESUMO 

Muitos estudiosos destacam o papel da infraestrutura na redução da desigualdade de renda. As economias 
em desenvolvimento apresentam imensas discrepâncias regionais e de renda, as quais estão correlacionadas 
com infraestruturas distribuídas desigualmente em termos territoriais e populacionais. Neste artigo, avalia-
se os efeitos da oferta de infraestrutura sobre a desigualdade de renda e verificamos se esses efeitos variam 
de acordo com o setor de infraestrutura e seu grau de qualidade e acesso no Brasil. A análise é baseada em 
modelos hierárquicos espaciais. Os resultados indicam que a infraestrutura se correlaciona negativamente 
com a desigualdade de renda. Assim, políticas destinadas a melhorar a qualidade da infraestrutura e ampliar 
o acesso à mesma são cruciais para reduzir a concentração de renda.

1. INTRODUCTION 

In  a  context  of  strong  fiscal  adjustment,  economic  stagnation  and  rising  income  inequality  in  many 
developing countries, many economists have pointed to investment in infrastructure as a key variable that 
can foster economic growth with a reduction in poverty and social inclusion (Ali & Pernia, 2003; Calderón 
& Servén, 2014). Previous studies have proven the importance of infrastructure as a promoter of economic 
growth through increasing productivity of production factors, improvements in competitiveness and trade, 
as well as its complementary effects in the formation of higher levels of private investment (Aschauer 1989, 
2004;  Calderón,  Moral-Benito  &  Servén,  2014;  Munnell,  1992).  Nevertheless,  the  possible  channels  of 
transmission of infrastructure on income inequality are unclear. 

From  a  theoretical  perspective,  an  adequate  infrastructure  provides  several  positive  social  impacts  that 
include,  in  addition  to  improving  environmental  conditions  and  energy  use,  better  education  and  health 
conditions, access to public goods and services, equality and social inclusion. Finally, infrastructure is seen 
as  a  tool  for  structural  change  in  the  economy  since  it  unites  transversal  advances  in  economic, 
environmental  and  social  terms,  generating  a  process  of  sustained  economic  and  inclusive  growth,  thus 
benefiting the poorest part of the population (Sanchez et al., 2017; United Nations, 2016). 

Empirical studies about that theme, however, are still very scarce, with substantial differences found in the 
main results. While some conclusions point to  a positive or null relationship between infrastructure and 
income inequality (Bajar & Rajeev, 2015; Makmuri, 2017; Mendoza, 2017), other researches indicate that 
infrastructure  expansion  is  a  key  factor  in  reducing  inequalities  (Calderón  &  Chong,  2004;  Calderón  & 
Servén, 2004, 2010; Hooper et al., 2017; Makmuri, 2017; Raychaudhuri & De, 2010; Seneviratne & Sun, 
2013). In addition to the scarcity of studies, many limitations can be noted in the existing literature. A first 
point concerns the variables used. Few studies take into account different aspects of infrastructure, such as 
supply,  quality  and  access.  Infrastructure  supply  indicators  alone  may  say  little  about  the  impacts  of 
infrastructure  on  issues  such  as  inequality  and  poverty,  since  the  expansion  of  these  assets  can  be 
concentrated on richer and urbanized regions, not necessarily translating into greater supply for the poorest. 
Another  issue  that  is  not  explicitly  addressed  in  the  literature  on  infrastructure  and  inequality  concerns 
spatial issues. Theoretically speaking, infrastructure affects the choices of both firms and families, and since 
it is distributed asymmetrically between regions, it decisively influences agents’ localization decisions such 
as  migration,  establishment  of  new  companies,  capital  investment  in  different  locations  etc.  (Ottaviano, 
2008).  Empirical  studies  on  infrastructure  and  economic  growth  have  proven  the  existence  of  such 
proximity spatial interactions (Arbués et al., 2015; Cosci & Mirra, 2017; Del Bo & Florio, 2008, 2012); 
however, although it is likely, it is unknown whether the same pattern of interaction can be observed for 
inequality. 

The Brazilian case presents interesting peculiarities. We observe a setback of a long cycle of falling income 
inequality, which began at the end of the 1990s. In 2015, the country shows the first high in the Gini Index 
since the turn of the century. In addition to the worsening of inequality indicators, there is a sharp drop in 
infrastructure investment, which was around 1.5% of GDP in 2017 (ABDID, 2018), one of the lowest levels 
of infrastructure investment in the country history. While these investments exceeded 6% of GDP in the 
1970s,  the  current  ratio  does  not  even  cover  the  infrastructure  losses  that  occur  through  depreciation. 
Decades of insufficient investment has contributed to a precarious current infrastructure in several aspects, 
which include insufficient supply, poor quality and limited population access in most sectors. 

Another  intriguing  specificity  of  the  Brazilian  economy  refers  to  the  immense  regional  and  income 
discrepancies.  In  relation  to  the  regional  contrasts,  there  are  large  regional  heterogeneities  in  general 
represented by an extremely poor and unequal North–Northeast region and a richer and more egalitarian 
Center–South region. Similarly, one can observe strong spatial autocorrelation patterns in the incidence of 
inequality in Brazilian states and municipalities (Silva & Leite, 2017), since more unequal municipalities 
perpetuate similar conditions in terms of poor infrastructure, low educational level, limited governmental 
technical  capacity,  poor  quality  of  health  etc.,  propagating  a  vicious  cycle  of  transmission  of  these 
inequalities to their neighbors. The distinctions of income are also remarkable. In 2015, about 85% of the 
richer population was served with Internet service, while only 21% of the poorer population was covered 
2 

 

by this same service. A similar situation is observed with regard to sewage, and there is still a considerable 
parcel of the poor population who are without access to treated water (Raiser et al., 2017). 

In a context that includes immense spatial heterogeneities, as in the Brazilian case, are there any effects of 
infrastructure supply on income inequality? Do these effects vary according to the infrastructure sector and 
its degree of quality and access in a particular state or municipality? In order to answer these questions, a 
broad database of varied indicators for the transportation, power, telecommunications and sanitation sectors 
is elaborated. This paper tests, for the first time, many of these indicators. The inclusion of several sectoral 
infrastructure  measures,  which include supply, quality and  access  in  the  sectors analyzed,  allow  a more 
realistic and specific analysis of the effects of these sectors on income inequality. In this way, the existence 
of  heterogeneous  effects  of  the  infrastructure  itself  can  be  verified.  Another  contribution  of  this  study 
concerns the inclusion of spatial aspects in the econometric model. In this sense, the use of hierarchical and 
spatial models is proposed, which allows us to treat both spatial heterogeneity (data distributed at different 
levels, such as municipalities and states) and spatial autocorrelation (spatial proximity interactions). This 
is,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  the  first  study  that  empirically  investigates  the  relationship  between 
infrastructure and income inequality, taking into account spatial dependencies and heterogeneities, as well 
as infrastructure effects heterogeneities. 

The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the variables used in the study as well as their 
respective  sources  and  treatment  methods.  The  third  section  describes  the  methodologies  utilized.  The 
estimated  results  of  infrastructure  effects  on  income  inequality,  taking  into  account  both  spatial 
heterogeneity and spatial dependence through spatial hierarchical models, are reported in the fourth section. 
Finally, the conclusions of the work are made. 

 

2. DATABASE AND INFRASTRUCTURE MEASUREMENT STRATEGY 

Due  to  data  limitations,  the  representative  variables  of  supply  and  quality  of  the  transport,  energy  and 
telephony sectors will be arranged in state aggregations. Toward the categories of sanitation and Internet 
and  the  access  indicators  representing  electricity  and  telephony  services,  the  aggregation  is  taken  in 
municipal character. As it is possible that infrastructure investments take some time to mature and generate 
effects  on economic development  (Hooper et  al.,  2017;  Makmuri, 2017),  we sought  to  include previous 
years together with the year 2010. However, another limitation arising from the unavailability of data  is 
related to the time at which data on infrastructure is available, period that varies according to the sector 
analyzed. To mitigate possible problems of discrepant observations or null values for some years, averages 
were calculated for the supply and quality variables for the period 2004–2010. Exceptions are given in the 
case  of  telecommunications,  where  data  are  available  for  the  2007–2010  period,  and  for  infrastructure 
access variables, which, in turn, are for the year 2010. The data sample contains 5,426 observations. 

In  this  way,  the  infrastructure  variables  were  created  following  the  national  and  international  literature, 
considering the different sectors that make up the concept of infrastructure (Bajar & Rajeev, 2015; Calderón 
& Chong, 2004; Calderón & Servén, 2004, 2010; Chakamera & Alagidede, 2017; Makmuri, 2017; Straub 
& Hagiwara, 2010). Variables to represent the sectors of transportation, power, telecommunications and 
basic  sanitation  are  captured.  Then,  the  variables  disaggregated  by  sectors  are  used  to  generate  new 
measures  in  order  to  better  describe  the  multidimensional  aspect  of  infrastructure  (Calderón  &  Servén, 
2014).  Therefore,  indexes  representing  infrastructure  supply,  quality  and  access  are  created  through 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which each one includes—whenever it is available—variables from 
all infrastructure sectors analyzed in this work. 

Finally, we used the variables of supply, quality and access to create “hybrid” indexes of infrastructure, 
analyzed by sector and in aggregate form. It is assumed that quality can act as a burden that enhances (or 
limits) the effects of infrastructure supply on income inequality (Chakamera & Alagidede, 2017). Similarly, 
it  is  argued  that  access  to  infrastructure  may  weigh  the  relationship  between  infrastructure  supply  and 
income inequality, whereas this infrastructure can be allocated asymmetrically in the population. In this 

 

3 

way, indices for the various sectors were created as the interaction of the supply variables with those of 
quality and access. 

 

2.1 Infrastructure supply 

The first group of representative infrastructure variables is related to their supply level. This type of variable 
captures the provision of a given infrastructure sector for a given state or municipality. In other words, it 
concerns the stock of power, transportation, telecommunications and sanitation that is offered for general 
use by the population. 

In relation to the transportation sector, the natural logarithm of the total extension of paved and unpaved 
roads (km) divided by the state population is used as a proxy variable. To represent the power sector, the 
indicator residential energy consumption (GwH) per capita is used. Regarding telecommunication sector, 
two  quantity  variables  are  used.1 The  first  one  represents  Internet  supply,  being  arranged  by  the  natural 
logarithm  of  Internet  accesses  divided  by  the  number  of  inhabitants  of  each  municipality.  The  second 
measure consists in the natural logarithm of the sum of fixed and mobile telephony accesses divided by the 
number of state inhabitants.  Municipal  sanitation  quantity is represented by the logarithm  of the  treated 
water volume distributed per day (m³) per capita, which is collected from the National Survey of Basic 
Sanitation for the year 2008 (IBGE, 2008). 

 

2.2 Infrastructure quality 

The second group of infrastructure variables seeks to capture the quality of the sectors, or their efficiency. 
In  this  sense,  these  measures  represent  the  capacity  of  a  given  infrastructure  to  effectively  provide  the 
expected services, such as the moving of people with safety and speed, water with adequate conditions for 
people’s health etc. Given that none of the supply variables contain these characteristics, it is fundamental 
to include the indicators of infrastructure quality, since supply effects can be heterogeneous according to 
their efficiency (Calderón & Servén, 2010, 2014; Makmuri, 2017; Straub, 2011). 

The transportation quality is represented by the percentage of total length of highways (km) classified as 
being  in  good  and  excellent  condition.  It  is  believed  that  the  variable  chosen  in  this  study  is  adequate 
because, besides taking into account the paving of highways, it considers other qualitative issues related to 
road safety and conservation (CNT, 2018). 

Regarding  power  quality,  the  natural  logarithm  of  the  ANEEL  (National  Electric  Energy  Agency) 
Consumer Satisfaction Index (IASC) will be used. This index allows evaluating the residential consumer 
satisfaction with the services rendered by the electric power distributors, capturing items such as: perceived 
quality; perceived value (cost-benefit ratio); overall satisfaction; confidence in the supplier; and fidelity. 
For those states that were served by more than one electric power distributor, simple arithmetic averages 
of distributors were calculated. 

In relation to the telecommunication sector, two variables are used to capture Internet and telephony quality. 
The first one refers to the proportion of Internet accesses with speed above 512 Kbps, connection that are 
classified as non-slow speed. The choice of this variable followed the classification made by Swiss (2011). 
Telephony quality is represented by the Completed Originated Call Rate. In the telephony case, since the 
states are served by more than one provider, state averages of these rates were calculated. 

To represent sanitation quality or, in this case, inefficiency, we use the proportion of hospitalizations from 
waterborne diseases. This variable captures qualitative aspects related to inefficiency in the treatment of 
water and sewage, with consequent implications on the number of hospitalizations due to diseases caused 
by sanitation quality. 

 

2.3 Infrastructure access 

 

4 

The  last  range  of  variables  used  refers  to  that  representing  population  access  to  infrastructure,  all  with 
municipal scope. Access, in the sense used in this work, is understood as the ability or the possibility that 
people have to utilize some infrastructure service. 

In order to depict access to infrastructure, variables of the Demographic Census are collected. This survey 
allows us to evaluate household access to infrastructures. Then, household measures are aggregated at the 
municipal level.  Regarding transportation sector,  there are no  available variables fulfilling the proposed 
requirements for this type of variable. Power access is represented by the percentage of households with 
electricity. Similarly, telecommunications access, reproduced here by telephone services, is represented by 
the percentage of households with access to fixed or mobile telephone. In turn, basic sanitation access is 
represented by the percentage of households with adequate water supply and sanitary sewage. Table A1 in 
Appendix summarizes the infrastructure variables used. 

 

2.4 Composite indices: an application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 

The indexes are created by Principal Component Analysis according to infrastructure characteristic and its 
aggregation.  Therefore,  for  the  supply  case  two  indices  are  calculated,  one  containing  the  state-level 
variables, and the other with the municipal level variables. The same is true for quality measures. In relation 
to access indicators, a single index is created in municipal aggregation. A full description of the method 
can be obtained in Dunteman (1989). 

Table  A4  in  Appendix  describes  the  proportion  of  the  variance  and  its  accumulation  with  the  different 
components for the indices created. In all cases, we chosen to use those components that had an eigenvalue 
greater than one, following the Kaiser’s criterion (Kaiser, 1958). The indices are described in the equations 
below: 

𝑆𝐼𝑆 =   −0,283 ∗ 𝑂𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝 + 0,696 ∗ 𝑂𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔 + 0,661 ∗ 𝑂𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐2 
𝑀𝐼𝑆 = 0,707 ∗ 𝑂𝑠𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑎 + 0,707 ∗ 𝑂𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐1 
𝑆𝐼𝑄 =  0,689 ∗ 𝑄𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝 + 0,663 ∗ 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔 + 0,291 ∗ 𝑄𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐2 
𝑀𝐼𝑄 =   −0,707 ∗ 𝑄𝑠𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑎 + 0,707 ∗ 𝑄𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐1 
𝐼𝐴𝐼 = 0,503 ∗ 𝐴𝑠𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑎 + 0,593 ∗ 𝐴𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔 + 0,628 ∗ 𝐴𝑡𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐

            (5) 

The first index created, named State Infrastructure Supply Index (SIS), condenses the information about 
power,  telephony  and  transport  state-level  variables.  According  to  equation  1,  power  and  telephony 
indicators  have  a  substantial  weight  in  the  index,  with  a  positive  sign.  The  second  index,  designed 
Municipal  Infrastructure  Supply  Index  (MIS),  added  information  on  sanitation  and  Internet  provision 
indicators, which have the same positive weight in the composite index. 

A similar procedure is implemented for quality measures, creating the State Infrastructure Quality Index 
(SIQ) and the Municipal Infrastructure Quality Index (MIQ), with the same sectors as the supply indexes. 
While in the municipal index the variables of sanitation inefficiency  and  Internet quality have the same 
weight, in the state index the variables that hold the highest weight are those linked to the transportation 
and power sectors. 

Finally,  the  Infrastructure  Access  Index  (IAI)  synthesized  information  on  the  variables  of  access  to 
electricity, telephony and sanitation. All variables had a significant influence on the index, in such a way 
that it represents well the access to infrastructure in the Brazilian municipalities. The composite indicators 
described in the equations above are used in the subsequent econometric analysis. 

 

2.5 Hybrid indices: interactions between infrastructure characteristics 

The hybrid indexes proposed in this paper seek to simultaneously capture the aggregate effects of access, 
quality and infrastructure supply indicators. When analyzing the links between infrastructure and income 
inequality, having only one supply indicator is insufficient. In addition, separate analysis of the effects of 
provision,  access  and  quality,  may  not  fully  reveal  the  impact  of  the  infrastructure,  which  is  a  great 
5 

 

challenge in the causality test. Finally, no studies using a hybrid aggregate index that considers both the 
infrastructure stock and access were found, in such a way that it becomes a contribution of this study to test 
such interactions in the econometric models. Hybrid indices can be described as: 

𝑆𝑆𝑄 = 𝑆𝐼𝑆 ∗ 𝑆𝐼𝑄 
𝑀𝑆𝑄 = 𝑀𝐼𝑆 ∗ 𝑀𝐼𝑄 
𝑆𝑆𝐴 = 𝑆𝐼𝑆 ∗ 𝐼𝐴𝐼 
𝑀𝑆𝐴 = 𝑀𝐼𝑆 ∗ 𝐼𝐴𝐼  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    (9) 

(6) 
(7) 
(8) 

In equations 6 and 7 the interactive indices are described between supply and quality both at the state and 
municipal level, respectively. In relation to hybrid indicators of quantity and access, two indicators were 
also created, both state and municipal level (equations 8 and 9, respectively). This choice was chosen due 
to the fact that the telephony and power sector have municipal access indicators, however, their supply is 
arranged by state. On the other hand, sanitation access and provision are given at the municipal level, and 
an interaction at this level is necessary. The same procedure is done for the disaggregated variables. The 
multiplication between supply and quality is named with the initials S (supply) and Q (quality) (example 
SQtransp to the transportation sector), while the interaction between supply and access is named with the 
initials S and A (access) (example OAenerg to the power sector). 

 

2.6 Income inequality and control variables 

In order to represent income inequality, we use “Ratio 10/40 (r1040),” a measure that compares the average 
per capita household income of the individuals belonging to the richest decile of the distribution, with the 
average per capita household income of the individuals belonging to the poorer two-fifths of people. The 
universe of individuals is limited to those who live in permanent private households. 

The control variables are represented by the logarithm of the industrial value added per capita, the logarithm 
of the aggregate value of agriculture per capita, the logarithm of the value added of the services sector per 
capita,  logarithm  of  the  education  human  development  index,  logarithm  of  health  human  development 
index,  formalization  degree  of  employed  persons,  rate  of  infant  mortality  and  the  logarithm  of  total 
population. All control variables, as well as the dependent variable, are from the year 2010.2 Table A2 in 
Appendix summarizes this  group of variables, while Table  A3 describes  the descriptive statistics  of the 
variables used in the work. 

 

3. INFRASTRUCTURE EFFECTS ON INCOME INEQUALITY IN A REGIONAL APPROACH: 
THE HIERARCHICAL SPATIAL AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL (HSAR) 

Since spatial heterogeneities and dependencies patterns can coexist, it is necessary to treat these two types 
of problem together. A model that solves such difficulties is the hierarchical spatial autoregressive model 
(HSAR), proposed by Dong and Harris (2014). According to the authors, the purposes of HSAR are: i) to 
avoid the “ecological fallacy,” which occurs when transferring relations between variables on an aggregate 
scale  for  individuals;  ii)  to  avoid  the  “atomistic  fallacy,”  when  correlations  between  variables  are 
investigated  exclusively  at  individual  level,  without  taking  into  account  the  context;  iii)  investigate  and 
quantify contextual effects; and iv) provide better estimates of model parameters and their standard errors 
in the presence of group effects. 

The motivation of Dong and Harris (2014) in HSAR elaboration was linked to the inability of conventional 
hierarchical  models  to  deal  with  spatial  issues  that  went  beyond  group  heterogeneity.  According  to  the 
authors, classical hierarchical models would be able to treat the so-called “vertical group dependence” (or 
spatial heterogeneity at the macro level), which occurs when lower level units are similar, since they absorb 
identical group effects. However, such models fail to treat the so-called “horizontal group dependence” (or 
spatial autocorrelation), characterized by interactions and spillovers that occur due to geographic proximity.

The HSAR model, by including the hierarchical data, provides more efficient and accurate estimates for 
the  regression  coefficients.  In  addition,  it  provides  more  correct  estimates  of  the  intensity  of  spatial 
interaction at the lower level, separating it from the measurement of regional effects, with which it can be 
confused. In this sense, the HSAR model simultaneously integrates spatial autoregressive processes (SAR) 
for both the response variable and the upper level residues within a classical hierarchical approach. The key 
feature of the SAR process is that it allows the observed values of a dependent variable y in a particular 
locality  to  be  directly  dependent  to  the  values  observed  in  neighboring  locations  (or  spatial  lag  of  y), 
providing both specification and measurement of interaction effects (or spatial spillovers) (LeSage & Pace, 
2009). HSAR model specification follows as: 

𝑦 = 𝜌𝑊𝑦 + 𝑋𝛽 + 𝑍𝛾 + ∆𝜃 + 𝜀

Where y is a column vector N × 1 of the dependent variable values; ρ is the level 1 spatial autoregressive 
parameter; W is the spatial weights matrix at municipal level; X is a matrix N × K of independent variables

The  spatial  multipliers  ρ  (Corrado  &  Fingleton,  2012)  and  λ  indicate  nothing  more  than  that  spatial 
dependence process can have causes such as: i) spatial externalities coming from explanatory variables; ii) 
spatial externalities coming from not observed factors; and iii) a feedback or diffusion effect on y; in other 
words, some unobserved spatial factor that is captured in the error term. Since there are spatial interaction 
effects, a variation in some independent variable in municipality i has a direct effect on municipality i and 
an  indirect  effect  on  other  municipalities.  The  same  is  true  for  a  variation  in  a  state-level  independent 
variable. The direct, indirect and total effects calculation methods can be seen in Dong and Harris (2014). 
HSAR  model  estimation  is  implemented  through  a  Bayesian  simulation  approach  using  Markov  Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. 

 

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The  first  practical  step  is  to  test  the  existence  of  global  spatial  autocorrelation  using  Global  Moran’s  I 
statistic.3 As described in Table A5 in Appendix, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no spatial 
autocorrelation  in  all  the  variables  analyzed,  except  for  transportation  supply  and  telephony  quality. 
However, the Moran’s I statistic is purely global, thus not allowing us to determine possible clusters and 
spatial  outliers  between  the  municipalities.  Local  measurements  of  spatial  autocorrelation  are  more 
adequate for this type of inference. Figure 1 graphically depicts  Local Moran’s I statistic for the income 
inequality measure. The  map  includes municipal values for the Moran Scatterplot that were statistically 
significant at the 5% level. 

It can be seen from Figure 1 that there are clusters for income inequality. Without great details, Brazil can 
practically  be  divided  in  two.  North  and  Northeast  regions  have  large  clusters  of  positive  spatial 

 

7 

autocorrelation  highlighting  high  inequality  areas,  that  is,  municipalities  with  high  inequality  values 
surrounded by other municipalities also with high income disparities. South and Southeast regions, although 
to a lesser extent in relation to the North and Northeast, present sets of municipalities, in proximity, with 
low income inequality.

Before proceeding with spatial model estimations, we estimate the null conventional hierarchical model in 
order to analyze the importance of including a second (state) hierarchical level in the analysis. The value 
of intraclasses correlation coefficient of 0.66 indicates the importance of modeling the variance between 
groups. In other words, about 66% of the variance of income inequality can be explained by the hierarchical 
structure of the data. 

Since  spatial  exploratory  analysis  indicated  remarkable  spatial  dependence  patterns  in  the  analyzed 
variables and the null conventional multilevel model indicated the presence of group dependence, the next 
step of the work is the application of the spatial hierarchical model. According to the HSAR model estimates 
set  out  in  Appendix  (Tables  A6,  A7,  A8,  A9),  both  spatial  parameters,  ρ  and  λ,  are  significant  in  all 
specifications, indicating the importance of considering neighborhood interactions at the lower (municipal) 
and  upper  (state)  levels,  respectively.  Regarding  the  control  variables,  it  can  be  observed  that  the 
formalization degree of workers, the level of educational and health  human development, and industrial 
value added correlate negatively with income inequality. On the other hand, the larger the population of the 
municipality,  the  infant  mortality  rate  and  the  value  added  in  the  service  sector,  the  lower  the  personal 
income equality in the municipalities. 

When we include the supply variables without any type of weighting (Table 1), it can be observed that only 
sanitation and telephony supply indicators correlate significantly with the municipal income inequality. The 
total effect of a 1% increase in the sanitation supply provides an income ratio of the richest 10% over the 
poorest  40%  (r1040)  0.149  times  lower.  This  total  effect  comes  from:  i)  direct  impacts  of  sanitation 
expansion in the municipality in which it is done, where a 1% increase in the basic sanitation provision 
correlates directly  with  a ratio  (10/40) 0.105 times lower; and ii) a feedback mechanism that spreads to 
neighboring municipalities and returns to the municipality itself, generating a return in terms of lower levels 

 

8 

of income inequality of approximately 0.044. Similarly, a 1% expansion in the telephony state-level stock 
correlates with a “10/40 ratio”, on average, 6.93 times lower (with a direct impact of -4.878 and an indirect 
effect of -2,052).

The Municipal Infrastructure Supply (MIS) Index also spreads significant effects on income concentration. 
The increase of 1% in the MIS negatively affects the income ratio by 0.375 units (-0.264 as direct impact 
and  -0.111  via  spatial  interactions).  Since  MIS  captures  information  on  the  Internet  service  and  basic 
sanitation municipal supply, this result indicates that the expansion of these services is an important factor 
for municipalities to reach higher levels of income equality. 

The  results  presented  so  far  provide  good  evidence  about  infrastructure  effects  on  inequality,  which 
corroborate  much  of  the  related  literature  (Calderón  &  Chong,  2004;  Calderón  &  Servén,  2004,  2010; 
Raychaudhuri & De, 2010) where negative effects of infrastructure supply on personal income inequality 
were  found.  However,  a  more  careful  analysis  encompasses  the  study  of  various  infrastructure 
characteristics, such as its quality and access. Next, the supply variables are weighted for their respective 
quality,  in  order  to  capture  possible  heterogeneities  in  supply  infrastructure  effects  on  income 
concentration. 

Table 2 shows the total, direct and indirect infrastructure supply effects weighted by its quality. Since we 
have included interactive variables between supply and quality, we have the supply term involved in two 
regression  parameters  (for  example, 𝑟1040 = 𝛽1 ∗ 𝑆𝑠𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑎 + 𝛽2(𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝 ∗ 𝑄𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝)).  The  marginal 
= 𝛽1 +
effect of an expansion in infrastructure supply can be obtained with the partial derivative 
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ indicates the average value of a certain quality infrastructure indicator. The 

𝛽2 ∗ 𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦
mean values used to calculate the marginal effects can be obtained in Table C3 in Appendix C. 

̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅, where 𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦

With  the  proposed  weighting,  the  results  change  considerably.  Both  parameters  representing  sanitation 
supply and quality were significant  and had an expected signal. The total effect of a 1% increase in the 
logarithm of the distributed water volume per capita, given the average sanitation quality, negatively affects 
the inequality measure by 0.166 units. Quality, in this case, ponders the infrastructure provision in the sense 
that  the  greater  the  proportion  of  waterborne  diseases  in  a  given  municipality,  the  less  negative  the 
infrastructure effects on inequality will be. This result was expected, since the returns of water and sewage 
provision may be higher in places with adequate treatment conditions. Since the poor may be more subject 
to precarious water and sewage treatment situations, expanding the sector in union with higher quality can 
guarantee more appropriate health conditions for the lower income group, as well as lower medicines and 
hospitalization expenses, perpetuating productivity gains to them and greater equality of income within the 
municipalities.

Regarding the transportation sector, we can note that while the supply coefficient remains non-significant, 
its  interaction  with  quality  is  significant  and  has  the  negative  sign.  This  result  indicates  that,  given  the 
existing level of transportation infrastructure, only expansion in conjunction with the improvement of this 
infrastructure is capable of providing lower levels of income inequality. The total effect of a 1% expansion 
in the highways supply, taking the average quality of the sector equal to 0.29, correlates with an appropriate 
income of the richest 10% being 1,975 times lower compared to the poorest 40%. The transportation quality 
helps  to  alleviate  income  inequality  by  increasing  the  region’s  comparative  advantages  for  trade,  the 
productivity of established businesses and the income of its workers. The reasonable explanation for this 
result would be that a better road network has a considerable distributional impact on household income. 
Since the lowest income layer in the population has a chance to access productive opportunities, their return 
access to better roads may be higher than the returns earned by high-income households. 

In relation to the power sector, the inclusion of the interaction between supply and quality has made the 
coefficient of the supply variable significant, as it occurs with the coefficient of interaction. The expansion 
of the state  power supply, taking the average quality of the sector, negatively  affects  income inequality 
(total effect of -0.24). It is noted that power quality acts as a supply-weighting factor so that the higher the 
quality,  the  greater  the  returns  from  power  stock  expansion  in  terms  of  lower  levels  of  income 
concentration. It is argued that a greater supply of infrastructure means little about income inequality, since 
it is not known whether the poorest localities and the poorest people are benefiting more from this supply 
than the non-poor. In turn, energy infrastructure quality is represented by an index that takes into account 
residential consumer satisfaction issues, such as cost-benefit and quality of services provided. In this sense, 
while people are being served by an infrastructure with lower cost and higher quality, it is very likely that 
the  poorest  are  the  most  benefited.  This  can  occur  because  this  parcel  of  population  is  the  one  most 
vulnerable to the payment of higher tariffs for power services, and also the one that suffers most from the 
loss of electrical appliances due to interruptions and poor quality of electricity supply services. 

The parameter related to the interaction between municipal supply and quality infrastructure (MSQ) was 
statistically  significant.  Given  the  average  quality  of  municipal  infrastructure,  a  1%  increase  in  the 
Municipal Infrastructure Supply Index (MIS) affects income inequality in approximately -0.371 units. In 

10 

 

this  case,  the  importance  of  the  expansion,  with  quality,  of  the  services  of  sanitation  and  Internet  is 
indicated. These findings corroborate some of the studies found in the literature (Calderón & Chong, 2004; 
Calderón & Servén, 2004, 2010; Seneviratne & Sun, 2013), in the sense that infrastructure quality plays an 
important role for localities to reach higher levels of income equality. In addition, the explanation given by 
Calderón and Chong (2004) that the quantitative link is stronger than the qualitative one is contradictory, 
since,  in  many  cases,  the  beneficial  infrastructure  supply  effect  on  lower  levels  of  inequality  seems  to 
necessarily result from a joint expansion in terms of supply and quality. 

The next step in the econometric analysis is to include the interactions between infrastructure supply and 
access. It is emphasized that the specifications set out in Table 3 are essential for the study of inequality 
that is conducted here, while capturing the infrastructure coverage/access effects, that is, the proportion of 
a certain population that, in fact, can receive the benefits of a particular infrastructure sector. Many of these 
indicators have not been tested in the literature, providing new evidence for the study about infrastructure 
and inequality. 

All parameters, except for those related to sanitation access and the interaction between supply and state 
infrastructure  access  (SSA),  are  significant.  Infrastructure  supply  has  maintained  its  negative  effect  on 
income inequality. A peculiar result is found in the power sector case. The average effect of an increase of 
1% in power supply, taking the average of access in the sector, on income inequality is 0.265. That is, it 
correlates with greater inequality. This initial effect, however, is weighted by people’s access to electricity. 
The greater the access, the more the returns from infrastructure expansion tend to be negative, correlating 
with lower levels of income concentration. A particularity of the indicator of access to electricity should be 
mentioned.  Even  in  2010,  the  year  of  this  indicator,  the  vast  majority  of  the  Brazilian  population  had 
electricity facilities, as observed by a maximum value of the indicator of population served of 100% and an 
average  of  97%.  The  lowest  values  of  this  measure,  with  a  minimum  number  of  27%,  are  found  in 
municipalities with a high proportion of residents in rural and low-income areas, notably in the northern 
region of the country. The municipalities in the North of the country, in turn, have, in general, the highest 
indicators of income inequality. In this sense, it can be expected that the returns of an expansion in power 
infrastructure in these regions are still very high, while in “average” municipalities, in terms of access to 
energy, the effects are smaller.

The  negative  returns  of  telephony  on  income  inequality  (-6,187),  in  turn,  are  reinforced  by  a  greater 
population access to fixed or cellular telephone. The effects of telecommunication expansion on inequality 

 

11 

are enhanced while more individuals have the means to use the services. Since there is  ample telephony 
coverage  in  a  given  municipality,  more  people,  including  the  poor,  can  benefit  from  better  productive 
opportunities, media, access to information and social interactions through telephony. 

The State Infrastructure Supply Index (SIS) has a direct impact on inequality (-2.63), so that the higher the 
state supply, the lower the levels of municipal income concentration tend to be. Finally, a 1% change in the 
Municipal Infrastructure Supply Index (MIS), taking the average of the Infrastructure Access Index (IAI), 
generates a negative effect of 0.52 on the “10/40 Ratio.” The results of the composite indices provide strong 
evidence that infrastructure affects inequality when more people actually access these infrastructures, rather 
than when such infrastructures have a greater degree of supply. In this sense, the theoretical argument made 
by Straub (2008) and Calderón and Servén (2014) is corroborated in that it is imperative to include variables 
of access and quality of infrastructure to better explain their relations with issues such as inequality and 
poverty. 

The final procedure in the analysis of the HSAR models is to verify whether the infrastructure supply effects 
are maintained when all of its characteristics are included. The results of this specification are set out in 
Table 4. The results, in general, resemble those obtained in the access weighting in the previous subsection. 
Nevertheless, there are changes in the magnitude of infrastructure returns on income inequality.

At  average  levels  of  quality  and  access,  the  higher  the  infrastructure  stocks,  the  smaller  the  municipal 
income disparities tend to be. The exception to this assertion is in the power sector, while supply expansion, 
on average, has positive effects on inequality. For comparative purposes, Table 5 describes the summary 
of the results of the HSAR models, showing the infrastructure supply returns of each interaction type. 

A perceptible consensus concerns the role of infrastructure access. This characteristic correlates negatively 
with  inequality  in  all  sectors  analyzed,  confirming  its  fundamental  role  in  ensuring  egalitarian  use 
conditions of essential basic services such as water, sewage, Internet and electricity. In general, it can be 
argued that the analysis of supply indicators, on its own, does little to say about the infrastructure effects 

12 

 

on  inequality,  since  only  three  in  seven  supply  variables  tested  had  their  significant  parameters.  The 
inclusion  of  infrastructure  quality  and,  especially,  access  make  most  of  the  parameters  significant, 
indicating important heterogeneities of the infrastructure characteristics for the Brazilian case.

5. CONCLUSIONS 

This work applies recent advances in hierarchical and spatial modeling econometric techniques to evaluate 
the  infrastructure  effects  on  income  inequality  in  Brazil  in  2010.  A  broad  database  representing 
infrastructure  in  Brazil,  both  at  the  municipal  and  state  levels  is  developed.  We  include  various 
infrastructure  sectors  and  characteristics.  It  is  argued  that  in  the  Brazilian  case,  the  possible  relations 
between  infrastructure  and  inequality  become  much  more  complex  due  to  their  regional  and  income 
heterogeneities. In general, the North  and Northeast regions have extremely poor conditions in terms of 
infrastructure supply, quality and coverage, while the South and Southeast regions and, to a lesser degree, 
the  Midwest  have  better  indicators.  In  addition,  there  is  a  considerable  correlation  between  states  and 
municipalities with better infrastructure and lower levels of inequality. 

The results obtained in this work do not only point towards a negative correlation between infrastructure 
and  income  inequality,  but  also  validate  the  theoretical  and  empirical  concerns  that  analyze  the  spatial 
interactions and their importance in studies on infrastructure. They also provide practical warnings referring 
to  representativeness  of  infrastructure  variables,  since  there  are  important  heterogeneities  between  its 
sectors and characteristics. Estimates obtained through hierarchical spatial models allow us to conclude that 
the  infrastructure  supply,  with  the  exception  of  the  power  sector,  contributes  to  lower  levels  of  income 
concentration in the Brazilian municipalities. Some caveats, however, deserve attention. First, the inclusion 
of  supply  indicators  alone  gives  weak  evidence  of  the  infrastructure  effects  on  inequality,  while  most 
parameters were not significant. Only with the inclusion of quality and access weights, did we obtain the 
majority of significant parameters. The main results demonstrate that public infrastructure policies aimed 
at improving infrastructure quality and, essentially, expanding access are crucial for achieving lower levels 
of income concentration. 

13 

 

In order to understand the dynamic mechanisms of infrastructure interaction and income inequality in space 
and time, panel data models need to be specified and interpreted in future research. Due to the unavailability 
of data, this work was limited to cross-section analysis. In addition, we do not address possible problems 
of endogeneity between infrastructure and income inequality. 

 

NOTES 

1.  Both  Internet  and  telephony  indicators  represent  the  physical  or  logical  means  by  which  a  user  is 
connected  to  a  telecommunications  network  (ANATEL,  2012).  Therefore,  these  indicators  capture  the 
telecommunications provision to the total population, including people and firms. 

2. The variables used are available for municipal disaggregation only in the Demographic Census prepared 
by IBGE (2010). However, since most of the infrastructure variables used are not available for the period 
preceding to the year 2000, a temporal analysis was not feasible. 

3. To create spatial lags, first-order queen type matrices are created for each hierarchical level. It is the most 
commonly matrix used in space econometric studies. Therefore, both W (municipal) and M (state) matrices 
are  constructed  by  contiguity,  where  states/municipalities  that  have  a  common  border  are  considered 
neighbors.
