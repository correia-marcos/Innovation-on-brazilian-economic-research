ABSTRACT 

 

 

This paper investigates the returns to education in terms of individuals' health in Brazil.  We 
use the Heckman procedure (1979) and a nonlinear model that allows the consideration of the 
existence  of  increasing  returns.  The  study  employs  microdata  from  National  Survey  by 
Household  Sample  for  2003  and  2008.  The  health  status  is  measured  by  self-assessment  of 
individuals. We determine that the rate of returns decreases until the fourth and fifth years of 
schooling,  that  is,  until  the  completion  of  primary  education  when  increasing  returns  start. 
The evidence also indicates that the rate of return to education is lower for individuals in poor 
health;  for  people  with  15  or  more  years  of  schooling,  the  rate  of  return  is  10%  to  14.5% 
lower for those who are unhealthy.

RESUMO 

 

 

O  artigo  investiga  o  efeito  do  estado  de  saúde  na  taxa  de  retorno  da  educação.  O  método 
empregado  consiste  em  um  modelo  não  linear,  que  permite  a  existência  de  retornos 
crescentes,  e  no  procedimento  de  Heckman  (1979).  O  estado  de  saúde  é  mensurado  pela 
autoavaliação dos indivíduos. Com  base nos dados da PNAD de 2003  e  2008,  é encontrado 
que a taxa de retorno da educação decresce até o quarto e quinto ano de escolaridade, isso é, o 
retorno  se  torna  crescente  apenas  a  partir  da  conclusão  das  séries  iniciais  do  ensino 
fundamental. Os resultados também apontam que a taxa de retorno é inferior para indivíduos 
que  não  referiram  uma  boa  saúde;  para  indivíduos  com  15  ou  mais  anos  de  escolaridade,  a 
taxa de retorno é de 10% a 14.5% menor para indivíduos não saudáveis.

1. Introduction 
 
 
 
The relationship between health with schooling and income is well established by the 
literature.  This  relationship  has  been  found  in  different  countries  and  various measures  of 
health have confirmed these findings.  
 
First,  healthier  populations  might  have  higher  schooling  levels.  Grossman  (2000) 
argues  that  healthy  people  may  be  more  efficient  producers  of  additions  to  the  stock  of 
knowledge. Individuals in poor health miss more days of school and they learn less during the 
school  year.  Previous  studies  have  shown  empirical  evidence  of  this  relationship  by 
addressing  the  effect  of  low  birth  weight  on  adult  outcomes  in  twins  (Black,  Devereus  & 
Salvanes,  2007;  Oreopoulos,  Stabile,  Walld  &  Roos,  2008),  individual  shocks  in  utero 
(Almond, 2006; Almond, Edlund & Plame, 2009) and early childhood nutrition (Maluccio et 
al., 2009). 
 
Second, better health is associated with higher labor productivity and time available to 
work, which are essential factors in the labor market and, therefore, income. Healthier people 
tend  to  have  higher  labor  productivity  due  to  their  greater  physical  energy  and  mental 
clearness,  besides  having  a  greater  investment  in  human  capital,  the  main  driver  of 
productivity (Bloom & Canning, 2000). Furthermore, Smith (1999) showed that poor health is 
associated with lower income and fewer accumulated assets because people with poor health 
have increased medical expenses and limitations on working, so healthier people can work for 
more hours in a week and more weeks in a year. Bloom and Canning (2000, p.1209) conclude 
that  “poor  health  is  more  than  just  a  consequence  of  low  income;  it  is  also  one  of  its 
fundamental causes”. 
 
On  the  other  hand,  although  the  literature  is  replete  with  studies  of  the  relationship 
between  health  status  and  socioeconomic  variables,  especially  education  and  income, 
estimates  of  return  to  education  that  include  health  status  are  limited.  In  this  paper,  we 
investigate whether the returns to education change in the context of poor health and the year 
of schooling for which the difference intensifies. Specifically, we examine the rate of return to 
education in terms of individuals' health in Brazil.   

The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  section  2  provides  a  brief 
summary  of  studies  in  relation  the  rate  of  return  and  nonlinearity;  section  3  explains  our 
empirical strategies and describes the data set from Brazil; in section 4, the empirical findings 
are reported. Finally, section 5 presents the paper’s conclusions.       

 
 
  

 

2. Nonlinearity in the education 
 
 
 
In  the  literature  on  the  schooling  returns,  Mincer  (1974),  in  his  seminal  work, 
estimates  the  wage  equation  in  which  the  logarithm  of  hourly  earnings  is  explained  by 
schooling  years,  experience  and  the  square  of  experience.  In  this  model,  the  estimated 
coefficient  of  schooling  is  interpreted  as  the  return  of  an  additional  year  of  schooling.  The 
pioneering  work  of  Mincer  has  been  repeated  by  several  authors  for  different  countries  and 
periods (Psacharopoulos, 1994; Psacharopoulos & Patrinos, 2004; Rauch, 1993; Blackburn & 
Neumark, 1993; Moretti, 2004; Pons & Gonzalo, 2001). 
 
In particular in Brazil, numerous studies estimated the return to education based on the 
Mincer  equation,  such  as  Psacharopoulos  (1987),  Leal  and  Werlang  (1991),  Blom,  Holm-
Nielsen  and  Verner  (2001)  and  Araújo  Júnior  and  Silveira  Neto  (2004).  These  studies, 
although  important  in  the  literature,  did  not  consider  the  sample  selection  bias  discussed  by 
Heckman (1979). 

 

the  bias 

investigated 

Heckman  (1979) 

 
 
that  resulted  from  estimations  using 
nonrandomly  selected  samples  to  analyze  behavioral  relationships.  For  example,  when 
observations  on  wage  are  available  only  for  those  who  are  working,  the  wage  offered  by 
employers exceeds their personal reservation wage. A two-step process is used to correct the 
bias. The Heckman approach has been largely used in Brazilian empirical analysis, including 
Kassouf  (1994),  Sachsida,  Loureiro  and  Mendonça  (2004),  Resende  and  Wyllie  (2006)  and 
Dias et al. (2013). 
 
In general, a linear rate of return to education is often used in such literature. However, 
additional  empirical  studies  indicate  the  nonlinearity  of  the  returns.  Linear  models  assume 
that the returns to education are identical for each level of education, while nonlinear models 
allowing for different returns with different educational years. 

Analyzing  the  return  to  education  by  country,  Psacharopoulos  (1985)  found  that  the 
returns are highest for primary education. Heckman,  Lochner and Todd (2008) considered a 
nonparametric  approach  and  nonlinear  earnings  for  each  year  of  schooling.  They  estimated 
the marginal internal rates of return to education using data from U.S. decennial Censuses and 
the Current Population Survey. It is found that the returns for graduating from high school are 
larger  than  the  returns  of  graduating  from  college.  Park  (2011)  explored  the  return  to 
education in terms of respondents to the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth who changed 
jobs after an intervening period of education reinvestment. A linear rate of return to education 
is  rejected.  The  marginal  rate  of  return  increases  in  the  former  education  level  and  with  15 
years of the former level, the maximum, the real hourly rate of pay increases approximately 
20% with an additional year of investment. In Brazil, Dias et al. (2013) estimated the rates of 
return by establishing the possibility of increasing returns with a nonlinear model. They found 
that increased returns to education start between four and five years of schooling and that the 
rate  of  returns  for  the  first  year  decreases  in  the  subsequent  years.  It  is  reached  again  only 
after almost concluding secondary education. 

In  terms  of  specific  groups,  Lamichhane  and  Sawada  (2013)  estimated  the  rate  of 
returns  to  education  for  individuals  with  disabilities  in  Nepal.  The  results  indicated  that  the 
return  to  investment  in  education  among  persons  with  disabilities  is  between  19.3%  and 
25.6% higher than those without disabilities. High returns are associated with low educational 
level group.  
 
 
3. Methodology 
 
3.1. Nonlinear model 

 

 

 
Acemoglu (1996) discussed a microfoundation for increasing returns in human capital 
accumulation, emphasizing the matching effect, that is, the rate of return for other firms will 
also increase when a group of firms invests more, which affects the educational decisions of 
workers. In other words, if a group of workers increases its education, firms will invest more 
hoping to employ these workers, so wages will increase for all, even for some of the workers 
who have not invested in their human capital. Acemoglu explores a non-Walrasian approach. 
In  contrast,  Dias  et  al.  (2013)  developed  a  Walrasian  allocation  of  the  Acemoglu  model, 
following the model proposed by Yamarik (2008).  

The  theoretical  model  of  Dias  et  al.  (2013)  investigates  the  returns  to  scale  in 
producing human capital from the relationship between the wage rate with years of schooling, 
schooling  squared,  schooling  cubed,  experience,  experience  squared,  and  other  control 
variables. 

 

This  paper  employs  the  Dias  et  al.  (2013)  model,  with  returns  to  scale  in  producing 
human  capital  but  including  a  health  variable.  Accordingly,  we  consider  that,  in  addition  to 
education and experience, health also plays an important role in human capital.  

It  is  assumed  that  there  are  n  competitive  firms  in  producing  the  product,  yn.  The 

 

production function of firm n is 

 

 

                                                   
 

                                                  (1)

 

where An is technology, and Kn is the capital stock, both of which depend on qualified human 
capital. Hn is the level of production that is dependent on the choice of human capital. Thus, 
human capital has the following specification 

 

                                               
 

 

=

                        (2) 

Ln  is  the  amount  of  human  capital  with  qualification  i  (hi)  hired  by  the  company  n.  Thus, 
human  capital  is  a  function  of  schooling  (S),  experience  (E),  health  (H)  and  other 
characteristics of the individual (O). 
 
However,  it  is  not  always  possible  for  the  firm  to  choose  the  level  of  education  of 
individuals  to  hire  because  it  cannot  find  available  people  with  such  human  capital.  The 
education  level,  i,  is  given,  and  the  firm  chooses  only  the  optimal  amount  of  this  human 
capital, Ln. Therefore, the condition for profit maximization follows 

 

 

 

                                                      

                                              (3) 

 
In  the  proposed  model,  wages  (

)  depend  on  technology  (A),  the  capital/labor 

(kn=Kn/Ln) and human capital associated with the experience,  schooling and health. Because 
An and kn are given at one point in time, wage depend on the human capital of the worker i.  

According  to  equation  (3),  rates  of  return  are  associated  with  education,  with  an 
expected  higher  rate  of  return  to  higher  educational  levels.  Similar  to  education,  individual 
health  is  also  correlated  with  rates  of  return,  so  individuals  with  better  health  should  have 
higher  returns.  The  technology  (An)  and  the  capital  stock  per  worker  (kn)  influence  the  real 
wage, but have no effect on the rate of return to education. 

Given a simple extension of the Mincerian equation, the authors investigated possible 
increased returns due to individual human capital, and, if increasing returns exist, it is possible 
to determine the level of schooling at which they begin (threshold effect).  

Finally,  adding  to  the  equation  the  interaction  of  health  with  schooling,  schooling 
squared  and  schooling  cubed  with  the  purpose  of  considering  health  status  on  the  rate  of 
return to education, we have 
 
          ln(  
 
where X is a matrix of control variables. Thus, the estimated rate of return to education is

The  health  variable  (H)  assumes  a  value  of  one  for  healthy  individuals  and  is  zero

Therefore, the above theoretical model allows the estimation of gains for each school year.

3.2. Econometric Model Specifications 
 

 

The estimated model takes the following form:  

 

 

     Ln (wi)= 0+ 1S + 2S2 + 3S3 + 4(exp) +5(exp)2 + 6(dformaljob) + 7(dfemale) +     (7) 
             8(dmarried) + 9(d2008) + (dreportedhealth) + γ1(race) + γ2(region) + εi  
 
where ln (wi) denotes the logarithm of the monthly wage per hour; S is schooling; and (exp) is 
experience. The following are dummy variables: (dformaljob), assumes a value of one if the 
worker has a formal  job  and is zero otherwise;  (dfemale), assumes  a value of one if woman 
and  is  zero  otherwise;  (dmarried),  assumes  a  value  of  one  if  married  and  is  zero  otherwise; 
(d2008),  assumes  a  value  of  one  if  year  2008  and  is  zero  otherwise;  (dreportedhealth), 
assumes  a  value  of  one  if  individual  reported  health  and  is  zero  otherwise;  (race),  four  dummy 
variables to distinguish between white (base), black, yellow and brown; (region), five dummy 
variables to distinguish the Northeast (base), North, Midwest, Southeast and South.  
 
To  avoid  a  possible  selection  bias,  which  occurs  because  unemployed  people  only 
accept a job if the earnings are higher than their reservation wage, we used Heckman’s (1979) 
approach. Thus, it is considered the selection equation, namely: individual works (dependent 
variable), schooling; married, number of family members, woman with children under age 14, 
searched for work and chronic diseases. 
 
3.3. Data Description 
 
 
years 2003 and 2008, which have a special supplement on health. 

The data we used are from the National Survey by Household Sample (PNAD) for the 

Health status is measured by individual self-assessment. The individual evaluates their 
health as very good, good, fair, poor or very poor. In this paper, we consider good health to be 
very good or good health and poor health otherwise.  

For  the  sample  selection,  the  following  filters  were  used:  the  sample  includes 
individuals  between 20  and 64  years old; individuals with  an hourly  wage  of up to  R$ 600; 
and  the  Federal  District  (Brasília)  was  excluded  from  the  sample  because  its  economic 
activity  is  concentrated  in  the  public  sector.  Experience  is  calculated  as  the  individual's  age 
minus the age when they started working. Schooling is considered in years and ranges from 0 
to  15  years,  where  15  refer  to  15  or  more  years  of  study.  Table  1  shows  the  descriptive 
statistics of the variables used in this paper.

Fig. 1 shows the  average  hourly  wage  by  years  of  schooling  in  terms  of  self-reported 
health. In brief, those who reported good health have an hourly wage that is higher than those 
who  indicated  poor  health,  with  a  marked  difference  especially  for  highly  qualified  people 
with 15 years or more of schooling.

4. Returns to Education  
 
The returns to education are analyzed in two ways according to the table 2. i) The first 
 
column presents the results of equation (4) and includes the interaction between education and 
health.  ii)  The  second  column  shows  the  estimation  of  equation  (7)  for  individuals  in  poor 
health, and the third column shows the estimate for individuals in good health. Both cases use 
equations (5) and (6) to estimate the rate of return and the marginal rate.  

The equations are estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) and use the procedure of 
Heckman  (1979)  to  correct  the  selectivity  bias.  The  statistical  test  indicates  that  the  sample 
selection bias, athrho, was statistically significant at 5% in all models, indicating a correlation 
between the wage equation and the selection equation. Therefore, the Heckman method is the 
most  appropriate  for  the  analysis.  In  addition,  sample  weights  and  stratification  are 
considered. 
 
In all estimates, the coefficient of the formal job indicated that, considering the effects 
of other variables, the wage of individuals with a formal job was superior to that of all other 
individuals,  especially  among  groups  who  reported  poor  health.  Females  indicated  wages 
approximately  24%  less  than  men  in  all  groups,  while  married  people  had  wages 
approximately  10.6%  higher  than  unmarried  people.  For  race,  blacks  and  browns  had  the 
lowest wages, approximately 14% lower than whites (omitted), while yellow presented wages 
of  15%  higher  than  whites.  All  regions  showed  a  wage  higher  than  those  in  the  Northeast 
(omitted).  The  Southeast  region,  which  had  better  wages,  reported  an  hourly  wage 
approximately  45%  higher  than  that  in  the  Northeast.  Moreover,  based  on  the  interaction 
(HealthXSchooling), a positive effect of schooling on health was observed.

Table 3 and 4 summarizes the rate of return to education and the marginal rate. Years 
of  schooling  are  presented  at  the  end  of  the  educational  stages  in  addition  to  average 
schooling.  @  represents  the  years  of  schooling  that  mark  the  start  of  increasing  returns  to 
schooling.  

First, the rate of return is analyzed with interaction between education and health†. The 
return to  education is  higher for individuals in  good health  for  almost  all of  the 15  years of 
schooling in comparison to those in poor health. For people with 7 and 8 years of schooling, 
the rate of return was found to be equal independent of health status. Increasing rate of return 
to  education  starts  from  4.7  years  of  schooling  for  those  in  poor  health  and  5.4  years  of 
schooling for those in good health.

Fig.  1  illustrates  the  rate  of  return  over  15  years  of  schooling,  as  well  as  for  poor 
health and good health. The differential in the rate of return is higher at the ends. The rate of 
return for an individual without education is 30.3% lower for those in poor health. For those 
with  15  or  more  years  of  schooling,  the  rate  of  return  is  14.5%  lower  than  those  with  good 
health.

Next  it  is  reported  estimates  for  separate  equations  (good  and  poor  health) ‡.  The 
Hausman  test  (1978)  is  performed  to  confirm  whether  there  are  differences  between  the 
coefficients. Estimates of the same equation but for group health show there are differences in 
the  rate  of  return  for  all  years  of  schooling  and  that  this  differential  increases  with 
qualifications (Table 4).

The Hausman test allows us to determine whether the estimated coefficients for good 
and  poor  health  in  Table  4  are  significantly  different  or  not.  The  null  hypothesis  is  that  the 
differences  in  coefficients  are  not  systematic.  The  test  showed  that  the  null  hypothesis  was 
rejected, indicating that the differences are systematic; that is, there are differences in the rate 
of return to education between individuals in poor and good health (Appendix). 
                                                           
‡ Column (2) and (3) of table 2. 

 

 

The  average  schooling  of  the  two  groups  is  noteworthy;  individuals  with  health 
problems have on average 5.6 years of schooling, while individuals without health problems 
have  a  much  higher  average  schooling,  8.3  years.  This  result  has  been  found  in  several 
studies. The relationship between health and education is well established in the literature, as 
argued by Eide and Showalter (2011).  

Therefore,  although  individuals  in  good  health  present  higher  educational  levels,  the 
results  suggest  that,  when  healthy  and  unhealthy  people  have  the  same  level  of  education, 
they are not remunerated equally,  causing a differential in the rate of return to education. In 
other words, lower returns to education are obtained by individuals in poor health. 

In specific for people with 15 or more years of schooling, wherein the rate of return is 
10%  to  14.5%  lower  for  those  who  are  unhealthy,  some  characteristics  of  the  groups  are 
highlighted as potential explanations of this differential. The group who reported poor health 
is older and has more women, mean age of 45 years and 61% are women, while the mean age 
of  the  group  who  reported  good  health  is  39  years  and  56%  are  women.  Another  important 
difference  between  the  groups  refers  to  the  sector  to  which  they  belong.  There  is  a  higher 
proportion of individuals with poor health working in the educational sector (33%) and lower 
proportion  in  the  health  sector  (7%),  compared  to  individuals  with  good  health,  24%  and 
12%. 

 
 

5. Conclusion 

 

 
In Brazil, twenty-five percent of people reported being in poor health, making a large 
population  subject  to  the  well-established  limitations  described  in  the  literature.  There  is 
strong  evidence  that  health  plays  a  central  role  in  education  and  income;  however,  we  also 
analyzed the rate of education considering health status. 

In general, the rate of return decreased until four and five  years of schooling, that is, 
until  primary  education  was  completed,  at  which  point  increasing  returns  began.  After  this 
point,  the  returns  reach  a  maximum  with  15  years  of  schooling.  The  estimation  result  also 
shows  that  the  rate  of  return  to  education  is  lower  for  individuals  in  poor  health;  for 
individuals with 15 or more years of schooling, the rate of return is 10% to 14.5% lower for 
those who are unhealthy, which may discourage schooling by this group of individuals.  

Another  point  is  the  different  characteristics  found  between  healthy  and  unhealthy. 
The average amount of schooling is 8.2 years for those in good health and 5.7 years for those 
in  poor  health.  In  specific  for  people  with  15  or  more  years  of  schooling,  the  group  who 
reported poor health is older and has more women. Finally, our results suggest the importance 
of  programs  targeted  to  individual  health,  or  in  the  other  ways  improve  their  health  levels, 
given its relationship to key variables throughout the individual's life, such as education and 
return.
