Resumo 

 
O trabalho  infantil  vem  diminuindo desde meados da década de 1990. Foi  também  nesse período que a 
inspeção do trabalho no Brasil começou a dar maior importância ao combate ao trabalho infantil. Assim, 
o  presente  estudo  teve  por  objetivo  analisar  o  efeito  da  inspeção  do  trabalho  sobre  a  queda  no  trabalho 
infantil,  em  2000  e  2010.  As  análises  foram  realizadas  utilizando  o  método  de  mínimos  quadrados  em 
dois  estágios.  Os  resultados  encontrados  para  o  ano  2000  mostram  que  o  aumento  de  1%  na  inspeção 
reduziu a porcentagem de crianças e adolescentes que trabalham em todas as faixas analisadas. A redução 
foi de 0,22% para a faixa de 10 a 17 anos, de 0,45% para a faixa de 10 a 14 anos, de 0,19% para aqueles 
com  15  anos  e  de  aproximadamente  0,09%  para  a  faixa  de  16  a  17  anos.  Os  resultados  foram 
estatisticamente  significativos.  Para  o  ano  de  2010  os  resultados  mostraram  que  o  aumento  de  1%  na 
inspeção reduziu a porcentagem de crianças e adolescentes que trabalham em todas as faixas analisadas. 
A redução foi de 0,26% para a faixa de 10 a 17 anos, de 0,66% para a faixa de 10 a 13 anos, de 0,41% 
para  a  faixa  de  14  a  15  anos  e  de  0,08%  para  a  faixa  de  16  a  17  anos.  Todos  esses  resultados  foram 
estatisticamente significativos a 1%, com exceção da última faixa etária.

Abstract 

 
Child labor has been on the decline in Brazil since the mid-1990s. It was also during this period that labor 
inspections in the country began to attach more importance to fighting child labor. Thus, this study aimed 
to analyze the effect of labor inspections on the drop observed in child labor rates in Brazil in 2000 and 
2010  using  the  two-stage  least  squares  method.  According  to  the  results  for  2000,  a  1%  increase  in 
inspections reduced the percentage of working children and adolescents in all the analyzed age brackets. 
There were reductions of 0.22%, 0.45%, 0.19%, and approximately 0.09% for the 10-17, 10-14, 15, and 
16-17 age brackets, respectively. The results were statistically significant. For the year 2010, they showed 
that a 1% increase in  inspections reduced the percentage of working children and adolescents  in  all the 
age brackets that were analyzed. There were reductions of 0.26%, 0.66%, 0.41%, and 0.08% for the 10-
17,  10-13,  14-15,  and  16-17  age  brackets,  respectively.  All  these  results  were  statistically  significant  at 
1% level, except for the last age group.

1. Introduction 
 

Child labor is still a problem in Brazil and one that is deeply rooted in Brazilian society. Since the 
sixteenth century, children of indigenous origin were forced to  perform various tasks. From the moment 
that Brazil started to use slave labor brought from Africa, the children of these slaves were also forced to 
work like their parents. The problem persisted during Brazil’s industrialization period, which began in the 
late  nineteenth  century,  when  there  was  a  large  increase  in  the  number  of  children  working  in  both  the 
secondary  sector  and  in  new  activities  created  in  the  tertiary  sector.  There  were  reports  of  child  labor 
during that period and measures were taken to try to remedy the situation2. However, despite all efforts, 
child labor persists to this day (BRASIL report, 2011).  

According to the International Labor Organization  - ILO (2010a), in the 1980s there was a large 
increase in child labor. Di Giovanni (2004) shows that child labor continued to increase during part of the 
1990s, when a peak was reached, but after that the number of working children and adolescents began to 
decline. According to the author, data from the National Household Sampling Survey (PNAD) show that 
the peak was recorded in 1992, when 21.8% of all children and adolescents from 5 to 17 years old were 
working. However, that figure dropped to 12.6% in 2002.  

According  to  the  ILO  (2010a),  the  large  increase  recorded  in  child  labor  in  the  1980s  can  be 
attributed to the simultaneous occurrence of at least three events: i) a population explosion that began in 
the 1960s; ii) an increase in income concentration3; and iii) the prevalence of a culture that favored child 
labor4. 

The  good  news  is  that  child  labor  has  been  on  the  decline  since  the  mid-1990s.  By  analyzing 
PNAD  data,  Barros  and  Mendonça  (2011)  saw  that  child  labor  rates  have  dropped  between  1992  and 
2009.  This  shows  that  Brazil  has  been  successful  in  implementing  policies  designed  to  eradicate  child 
labor. 

Kassouf  (2015)  also  uses  PNAD  data5  to  analyze  the  evolution  of  child  labor.  In  Figure  1,  the 
author  shows  the  evolution  observed  in  the  percentage  of  working  children  and  adolescents  in  Brazil 
between  1992  and  2011  for  three  age  groups:  i)  children  between  5  and  9  years  old;  ii)  children  and 
adolescents  aged between 10 and 15; and iii) adolescents  in  the 16-17 age bracket6.   It  can be observed 
that child labor rates decreased in the three age ranges during the period. 

The data show that the highest incidence of child labor throughout the period was recorded among 
adolescents between 16 and 17 years old. However, this was also the group for which the sharpest drop in 
child  and  adolescent  labor  was  recorded  in  percentage  points.  Early  in  the  period,  about  45%  of  them 
were working, while later that figure dropped to about 23%, i.e. there was a drop of 22 percentage points 
in this incidence.  

                                                           
2  On  January  17,  1891,  Decree  No.  1,313  was  published.  It  set  out  measures  designed  to  legalize  the  work  of  children  and 
adolescent employed in factories in the Federal Capital.  
3  According  to  the  ILO  (2010a)  the  income  concentration  became  more  intense  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  but  according  to 
Hoffman (1973) this is not correct. Hoffman (1973) argues that the income concentration became  more intense in the 1960s 
and 1970s.  
4 The ILO (2010a) pointed out the existence of a culture that favors child labor, although it is not as strong today as it was then. 
That thought stems from the idea that child labor could solve the problems faced by poor children, who could work instead of 
attending  school.  This  is  because,  in  this  case,  studying  was  seen  as  a  waste  of  time,  based  on  the  notion  that  poor  children 
wouldn’t  have a better life even if they  had studied. So people thought that  working  was better  for them, or else they could 
become delinquents. 
5 The figure does not show data for 2000 and 2010 because the census was carried out in those years. The National Household 
Sample  Survey  is  not  carried  out  in  censuses  year.  Moreover,  the  PNADs  carried  out  in  1996  and  1997  didn’t  include 
information of working children under the age of 10. 
6 According to Kassouf (2015, pp. 17), “a worker was defined as a child or adolescent who had worked in the week preceding 
the interview, who has produced food for his or her own consumption, who had worked in construction for his or her own use 
or who had not worked in the week preceding the interview because he or she was on vacation or had a health problem. Thus, 
paid  or  unpaid  work  for  one  hour  or  more  in  the  week  preceding  the  survey  was  included,  while  children  and  adolescents 
looking for work or engaged in domestic work in the household were not included. In Figure 1, adolescents 16-17 years old 
falling under the category of ‘registered worker’ were excluded, but registered domestic workers were included. Adolescents 
14-15 years old working as apprentices with a formal contract were also excluded”.  

 

Approximately 23% of all children and adolescents between 10 and 15 years old were working in 
1992. This percentage dropped to 7% in 2011, i.e. there was a decrease of about 16 percentage points. For 
children between 5 and 9 years old, the incidence of child labor was already lower than 4% in 1992. In 
2011, the figure hit the mark of 0.4%.

     Note: the data don’t include adolescents aged from 13 to 17 formally registered as workers and neither rural areas of the  

north region. 

 

Data  from  population  censuses  also  show  that  child  labor  has  dropped.  Table  1  shows  the 
evolution of child labor in Brazil using data from the population censuses of 1991, 2000 and 2010. These 
data  confirm  the  downward  trend  in  child  labor,  showing  that  there  was  a  decrease  in  the  number  of 
working  children  and  adolescents  from  5,493,538  to  3,406,514  between  1991  and  2010.  However,  it 
should be emphasized that the data collected by the National Household Sample Survey differ from those 
collected  by  the  Census.  Despite  the  differences  in  the  figures,  data  from  the  two  sources  suggest  that 
child labor rates have declined since the 1990s.

There is no consensus in the literature around the factors that led to this sharp drop in child labor 
in  Brazil.  But  what  can  be  said  is  that  the  efforts  made  by  both  government  and  non-governmental 
agencies to fight child labor were stepped up in the late 1980s.  

According to Di Giovanni  (2004), the fight  against  child labor took new directions in  the 1980s 
both  from  the  legal  and  institutional  points  of  view.  The  author  argues  that  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and 
Employment (MTE) was already carrying out some actions to fight child labor at that time, but these were 
insufficient, given the size of the problem. However, from that moment on, a series of changes began to 
be implemented.  

Contributions from national institutions, such as from the Ministry of Labor and Employment, and 
from international institutions, such as from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the ILO, 
were  instrumental  in  bringing  about  those  changes.  Among  other  facts  that  marked  this  change,  the 
following  ones  deserve  special  mention:  (i)  the  promulgation  of  the  new  Constitution  of  1988,  which 
ensures  protection  to  all  children  and  adolescents;  (ii)  the  approval  of  the  Statute  on  Children  and 
Adolescents  (ECA)  in  1990;  and  (iii)  the  implementation,  in  1992,  of  the  International  Program  on  the 
Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC) (Di GIOVANNI, 2004; ILO, 2010a). 

 Based  on  this  information,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  more  recent  process  of  fighting  child  labor 
began  in  the  1980s  and  was  intensified  in  the  1990s.  According  to  the  ILO  (2010a),  it  was  also  in  the 
1990s that labor inspection in Brazil started to focus more on fighting child labor. In 1995, the MTE set 
up State Committees Against Child Labor, which were groups of labor inspectors specialized in fighting 
child  labor.  That  was  when  child  labor  was  included  in  the  agenda  of  the  MTE,  more  precisely  of  the 
Labor Inspection Secretariat, the agency in charge of labor inspection in Brazil. 

  After this new ally in the fight against child labor was established, the following question arose: 
did  labor  inspections  have  any  effect  in  reducing  child  labor  in  Brazil? With  the  aim  of  answering  this 
question, our paper analyzes the impact of labor inspections on child labor based on 2000 and 2010 data. 
Its importance lies in the fact that this issue had not been addressed by the literature so far. Almeida and 
Carneiro (2012) analyzed the effects of labor inspection, but for working adults only. This paper is based 
on the study developed by Almeida and Carneiro (2012), but our goal is to analyze the issue taking into 
account child labor. 
 

2. Labor inspection in Brazil 

 
According  to  the  ILO  (2010b),  labor  inspections  began  to  be  carried  out  in  Brazil  in  the  late 
nineteenth century and they were mainly focused on inspecting child and adolescent labor in factories set 
up in the federal capital, which at that time was Rio de Janeiro. They began to be carried out after Decree 
No. 1,313 of January 17, 1891 was issued. That decree stated that factories could not hire children under 
the age of 12. However, from 8 to 12 they could work as apprentices in textile mills. Girls aged from 12 
to 15 and boys in the 12-14 age range were allowed to work for up to seven non-consecutive hours a day, 
as continuous work could never exceed four consecutive hours. In addition, male adolescents from 14 to 
15 years old were allowed to work for up to nine hours a day under the same conditions. 
 
According to Werneck  Vianna (apud Oliveira, 2002 apud Miguel,  2004), that decree  established 
that  children  and  adolescents  should  not  be  engaged  in  dangerous  and  unhealthy  occupations.  To  make 
sure  that  this  decree  was  complied  with,  factories  should  be  inspected  every  month  by  an  inspector 
general from the Ministry of Interior, who should present a report in January describing the most notable 
events occurred in the previous year and suggesting measures to be taken to improve the situation of those 
minors. In addition, the decree impose pecuniary penalty for violators. However, according to the author, 
even though the decree was published in the Official Diary, it was never actually enforced. 
 
According  to  the  ILO  (2010b),  the  pillars  of  what  is  now  known  as  labor  inspection  in  Brazil 
began  to  be  erected  in  the  mid-twentieth  century.  Several  measures  marked  that  period,  including  the 
establishment of the Ministry of  Labor,  Industry and Commerce  in  1930. That  Ministry  was  created by 
Decree  No.  9,433  of  November  26,  1930.  According  to  Miguel  (2004),  the  creation  of  the  Ministry  of 

5 

 
Labor  made  it  possible  to  set  up,  in  1931,  the  National  Labor  Department,  the  agency  in  charge  of  the 
internal organization of the Ministry of Labor.   
Another important measure was that of establishing the Regional Labor Inspectorates (Inspetorias 
 
Regionais)  in  the  states  in  1932.  These  inspectorates  were  charged  with  monitoring  the  enforcement  of 
laws  designed  to  protect  workers.  In  1940,  they  became  the  Regional  Labor  Offices  (Delegacias 
Regionais  do  Trabalho  -  DRTEs).  Another  important  measure  was  that  of  creating  the  career  of  labor 
inspector in 1944. 
 
Internationally, workers gained a strong ally in 1919, when the International  Labor Organization 
was  created.  ILO  was  not  only  concerned  with  making  and  implementing  international  labor  standards, 
but  also  with  strengthening  labor  inspections,  since  this  is  an  instrument  that  can  be  used  to  ensure 
worker’s rights. Thus, in 1947 the ILO adopted Convention No. 81, which states that labor inspections are 
mandatory for countries that ratify the convention (ILO, 2010b). 

The  ILO  Convention  No.  81  was  passed  by  the  Brazilian  Congress  in  1956  through  Legislative 
Decree No. 24 and promulgated by Decree No. 41,721 of June 25, 1957. However, Brazil denounced the 
Convention in 1971, reinvigorating in December 1987.  

According to Miguel (2004), despite having denounced Convention No. 81 in 1971, the military 
government took measures that are now part of the Brazilian labor inspection system. These included the 
creation  of  the  Federal  Labor  Inspection  System  (SFIT).  The  SFIT  was  established  at  the  end  of  the 
military regime as part of the National Labor Protection System, which was created by Decree No. 3,194 
of December 14, 1981. Still according to the author, two other measures taken after the end of the military 
dictatorship contributed to consolidating the labor inspection system in Brazil: i) the establishment of the 
Labor  Prosecution  Office  (after  the  Constitution  of  1988  was  promulgated);  and  ii)  the  creation  of  the 
Federal Labor Inspection System Development Program in 1989. 

According to Cardoso and Lage (2005), in the 1990s the MTE adopted innovative ways to settle 
labor-related  disputes  detected  in  labor  inspection  operations  by  trying  to  implement  channels  for 
negotiations  between  the  parties  to  the  disputes.  Corseuil,  Almeida  and  Carneiro  (2012)  highlight  two 
new measures: i) the publication of a Manual do Mediador (mediator’s manual) in 1996 as a primer with 
instructions  on  how  to  settle  disputes  between  employers  and  employees;  and  ii)  the  establishment  of 
“negotiation  round  tables,”  where  it  was  possible  to  negotiate  with  employers  new  ways  to  remedy 
violations of labor laws detected by labor inspectors. 

In  their  analysis  of  the  labor  inspection  system  in  Brazil  between  1995  and  2006,  Corseuil, 
Almeida and Carneiro (2012) argue that there was a change in the way labor inspectors acted during that 
period. Initially, labor inspectors in Brazil acted in response to reports of violations of labor laws or based 
on a random selection of sites for inspection. The way that inspectors were paid was an integral part of 
this inspection model. Auditors were given bonuses based on their performance, which was related to the 
number of inspected facilities, the amount collected in fines, and other measures. This bonus system was 
a  means  used  by  the  SFIT  to  stimulate  the  inspectors  to  do  a  good  job.  However,  many  changes  were 
made  in  recent  years  with  the  aim  of  enhancing  the  efficiency  of  inspection  activities  (CARDOSO  and 
LAGE, 2005; CORSEUIL, ALMEIDA & CARNEIRO, 2012; ILO, 2010b). 
 
In  2008,  Law  11,890  was  passed  with  the  aim  of  eliminating  the  bonuses  given  to  several 
categories of civil  service professionals,  including to  labor inspectors, turning them into subsidies. This 
was a major change, as it was meant to make sure that the only purpose of inspections was that of fighting 
violations of labor laws and to prevent them from being used as a way to increase the wages of inspectors 
(ILO, 2010b). 

Since then, inspectors began to carry out their actions based on clear-cut plans and not in response 
to  reports  of  violations  of  labor  laws  any  longer.  Such  reports  still  lead  to  inspection  actions,  but  since 
then  inspectors  began  to  play  a  more  active  role  in  planning  those  actions.  This  made  their  work  more 
efficient (Corseuil, Almeida and Carneiro, 2012).

2.1 Framework of the labor inspection system in Brazil 
 
 
According  to  the  1988  Federal  Constitution,  it  is  up  to  the  Federal  Administration  to  organize, 
maintain  and  carry  out  inspection  actions  in  Brazil.  The  MTE  is  the  agency  in  charge  of  ensuring 
compliance  with  that  provision,  and  it  delegated  this  role  to  one  of  its  executive  secretariats:  the  Labor 
Inspection Secretariat (SIT) (CARDOSO and LAGE, 2005; ILO, 2010b). 
 
Article 14 of Decree No. 5,063 of May 3, 2004 provides that the powers of the SIT include that of 
“defining  and  proposing  guidelines  for  labor  inspection,  including  of  labor  in  ports,  giving  priority  to 
establishing a policy designed to fight forced and child labor, as well as all forms of degrading work.” It 
is  divided  into  two  departments:  i)  the  Labor  Inspection  Department  (DEFIT);  and  ii)  the  Safety  and 
Health  at  Work  Department  (DSST).  Both  the  DEFIT  and  the  DSST  are  responsible  for  planning  and 
defining  guidelines to  be followed in  inspection  actions. However, the former  guides its actions toward 
enforcing  labor  laws,  while  the  latter  focuses  its  actions  on  monitoring  standards  related  to  safety  and 
health at work (CARDOSO and LAGE, 2005; ILO, 2010b). 
 
In  addition  to  these  departments,  the  MTE  has  agencies  in  all  the  Brazilian  states,  which  are 
divided into three categories: i) Regional Labor and Employment Superintendences (SRTEs); ii) Regional 
Labor and Employment Offices (GRTEs); and iii) Regional MTE Agencies (ARTEs). The SRTEs operate 
in 26 states and in the Federal District and their main role is that of implementing the administrative and 
labor policies defined by the MTE. The GRTEs report to the SRTEs and assist the Superintendences in 
providing services to workers. The Regional Agencies also operate in all states, but they exceed the others 
in number (in 2010, there were 480 of these agencies). Their primary role is that of providing services and 
information to citizens (ILO, 2010b). 
According  to  information  provided  by  the  MTE,  there  were  27  SRTEs  and  109  GRTEs  in 
 
operation  in  2013,  totaling  136  units  around  the  country.7  Figure  2  shows  the  distribution  of  these 
superintendences and regional offices in the 26 states and in the Federal District.

The SRTEs are located in state capitals. Thus, in figure 2 above, states whose figures are equal to 
one  only  have  SRTEs.  These  states  are:  Acre,  Amapa,  Rondonia,  Roraima,  Tocantins  and  the  Federal

District. States whose figures are equal to two have one SRTE and one GRTE (Alagoas, Espirito Santo, 
Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, Paraiba, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe). Sao Paulo is 
the state with more Regional Offices than any other, as it has 21 Offices and one Superintendence. Minas 
Gerais  ranks  second  in  this  regard,  with  20  Offices  and  one  Superintendence.  One  could  think  that  this 
disparity in the number of Regional Offices is due to the fact these two states are located in the southeast 
region,  Brazil’s  wealthiest  region.  However,  one  should  take  into  consideration  that  these  are  the  states 
with  the  largest  number  of  municipalities  in  Brazil.  According  to  the  2010  Census,  while  the  states  of 
Minas  Gerais  and  Sao  Paulo  have  853  and  645  municipalities,  respectively,  the  states  of  Acre,  Amapa, 
Rondonia and Roraima have 22, 16, 52 and 15 municipalities, respectively. Because each Regional Office 
is  in  charge  of  supervising  municipalities  around  it,  the  fact  that  states  with  a  large  number  of 
municipalities also have many Regional Offices is only natural. 

Labor  inspections  are  carried  out  by  labor  inspectors  (AFTs).    Labor  inspectors  are  hired  after 
being  approved  in  a  public  competitive  examination.  After  being  hired,  these  inspectors  report  to  the 
MTE for technical matters and to the SRTE to which they are assigned for administrative matters (ILO, 
2010b). 

Figure 3 shows the distribution of inspectors by state in 2001. It can be seen that of a total of 3,052 
active inspectors in that year, more than one-third were concentrated in the southeast region (639 in Sao 
Paulo,  359  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  249  in  Minas  Gerais).  As  stated  above,  the  states  of  Sao  Paulo  and 
Minas Gerais concentrate a large number of SRTEs and GRTEs, which may explain the large number of 
inspectors working in those states. Roraima is the state with the lowest number of inspectors, only five.

Figure  4  shows  the  distribution  of  inspectors  by  state  in  2010.  Again,  the  southeast  region 
concentrates a little more than one-third of the 2,983 inspectors who were active in that year. There was a 
slight drop in the number of inspectors in 2010 as compared to 2001. The states that lost most inspectors 
were the following ones: Sao Paulo (in 2001 it had 639 labor inspectors and in 2010 that figure dropped 
to 525), Rio de Janeiro (in 2001 it had 359 labor inspectors and in 2010 that figure decreased to 274) and 
Ceara (in 2001 it had 165 labor inspectors and in 2010 that figure dropped to 131). The states in  which 
the number of inspectors increased sharply in relation to 2001 were the following ones: Acre, Tocantins, 
Roraima, Amapa and Amazonas.

According  to  the  ILO  (2010b),  a  new  methodology  to  guide  the  planning  of  inspections  was 
implemented  in  April  2010.  From  that  moment  on,  the  planning  of  inspections  was  to  be  organized 
according  to  three  basic  guidelines:  i)  the  Multi-Year  Plan  (PPA);  ii)  the  Labor  Inspection  Secretariat 
(SIT); and  iii) the capacity of the local labor market  and of SRTEs to actually implement the proposed 
projects. The PPA is the planning instrument of the federal government that sets out objectives, strategies 
and actions to be carried out over a four-year period. For example, one of the goals of the 2008-2011 PPA 
was to eradicate child labor. 

After setting goals and establishing compulsory topics, the SIT: i) lists topics to be included in the 
mandatory  projects  of  all  SRTEs;  ii)  stimulates  the  SRTEs  to  draw  up  mandatory  projects  of  regional 
interest both in relevant sectors for the region’s economy and in sectors facing greater difficulties; and iii) 
defines  national  targets  for  every  Superintendence.  This  is  done  using  different  information,  such  as 
information  about  resources  available  in  each  SRTE  (e.g.  number  of  inspectors  available  in  them)  and 
about  the  labor  market  in  the  region.  This  new  methodology  made  it  possible  for  the  SRTEs  to  enjoy 
greater  autonomy  to  define  projects  to  be  implemented.  Despite  this  new  methodology  based  on  the 
planning  of  inspection  actions,  reports  of  violations  of  labor  laws  continue  to  guide  the  work  of  labor 
inspectors (ILO, 2010b). 
 

2.2 Effects of inspections on the labor market  

Studies suggest that the increasing planning of inspection actions has enhanced the effectiveness 
of  labor  inspections  in  Brazil  (CARDOSO  and  LAGE,  2005;  CORSEUIL,  ALMEIDA  &  CARNEIRO, 
2012; PIRES, 2013). Therefore, what are the effects, if any, of this phenomenon on the labor market? In 
this section, we will present some studies that address this issue. 
 
 Corseuil,  Almeida  and  Carneiro  (2012)  observed  a  significant  increase  in  the  growth  rate  of 
formal  employment  throughout  the  2000s.  In  their  study,  the  authors  set  out  to  analyze  to  what  extent 
labor  inspections  contributed  to  that  increase.  For  this  purpose,  they  used  municipal  data  for  the  1996-
2006 period. They obtained the data from  the Annual  Social Information  List (RAIS), from  the Federal 
Labor  Inspection  System  (SFIT)  and  from  the  IPEADATA  database.  Their  idea  was  to  analyze  how 
variations in  the intensity  of labor inspections in  both  temporal  and regional terms affected the creation 
and  destruction  of  jobs  in  municipalities.  The  results  were  presented  based  on  the  frequency  and 
efficiency of labor inspections. A tendency to create jobs was observed in municipalities in which labor 

                                                           
8 The reference is the number of active labor inspectors in December.

inspections became more frequent. However, the authors found no evidence that the increased frequency 
of inspections had any impact  on the aggregate job destruction rate. The  efficiency of labor inspections 
led  to  a  downward  trend  in  the  job  creation  rate,  but  no  effect  of  such  efficiency  on  the  aggregate  job 
destruction rate was observed.  
Almeida  and  Carneiro  (2009)  analyzed  the  effect  of  enforcing  employment  regulations  on 
 
company size in Brazil. Company size was measured according to the following variables: employment, 
production,  sales  and  capital  stock.  The  study  considers  the  fact  that  labor  regulations  are  not  enforced 
uniformly in Brazil. The authors argue that despite the efforts made by the Ministry of Labor to make sure 
labor regulations are complied with uniformly throughout the country, this hardly happens because Brazil 
is  a  continental  country  and  the  area  that  inspectors  must  cover  to  ensure  that  labor  laws  are  strictly 
enforced is huge. Furthermore, the number of inspectors is very small in relation to the geographical size 
of the country.   

According  to  the  authors,  there  are  two  channels  through  which  the  enforcement  of  labor 
regulations  may  reduce  the  size  of  companies:  i)  they  increase  costs  for  companies,  which  could  lead 
them to hire less workers and probably reduce their output;  and ii) the larger a company, the greater its 
visibility, which increases its likelihood of being inspected. Thus, reducing the size of companies could 
reduce the number of inspections (ALMEIDA and CARNEIRO, 2009).  

The  variable  used  to  measure  the  enforcement  of  labor  regulations  is  the  number  of  companies 
inspected by labor inspectors in  a  given municipality in  2002. However,  the authors argue that it  is  not 
possible to  assume that  every variation in  the measure that was used to  check the enforcement  of labor 
regulations  is  exogenous.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  in  some  municipalities  inspections  could  be  more 
frequent  simply  because  they  are  known  for  violating  labor  laws  or  because  they  are  more  developed 
municipalities. To solve this problem, the authors used the costs incurred in carrying out inspections as an 
instrument for the number of inspected companies. The variable that was used to measure this cost was 
the  distance  in  hours  between  a  municipality  where  a  company  is  located  and  the  regional  labor  office 
closest  to  the  municipality  in  question.  The  greater  the  distance,  the  higher  the  cost  of  inspections. 
Therefore, larger distances are likely to reduce the number of inspections in a municipality (ALMEIDA 
and CARNEIRO, 2009).  

The  results  indicate  that  increased  labor  inspections  reduce  the  size  of  companies.  It  was  found 
that a 1% increase in inspections reduced employment by 0.47%, reduced production by 0.48%, reduced 
sales  by  0.46%,  and  reduced  capital  stock  by  0.52%,  although  the  coefficient  for  capital  stock  was  not 
statistically significant (ALMEIDA and CARNEIRO, 2009).  

In a subsequent study, Almeida and Carneiro (2012) analyzed the impact of labor inspections on 
some  variables  related  to  the  Brazilian  labor  market.  More  specifically,  the  authors  analyzed  how 
increased  labor  inspections  affect  formal  and  informal  employment.  The  authors  argue  that  in  the  early 
1990s  labor  inspectors  began  to  step  up  inspections  with  the  aim  of  checking  whether  labor  rights  and 
compulsory  benefits  of  workers  were  being  ensured,  such  as,  for  example,  their  right  to  the  Severance 
Indemnity Fund for Employees (FGTS).  

The authors set out to measure the impact of inspections on the labor market using variations in 
their frequency in the municipalities based on a set of data for 2000. The problem with this strategy is that 
inspections are not determined randomly. Inspections can be more intense in municipalities with reports 
of violations of labor laws or because these municipalities are more developed institutionally (ALMEIDA 
and CARNEIRO, 2012).  

In  order  to  solve  this  problem,  the  authors  argue  that  it  is  necessary  to  determine  the  necessary 
“inputs”  to  define  the  “inspection  technology.”  According  to  them,  two  inputs  are  necessary:  i)  the 
number of labor inspectors available in each regional labor office (GRT); and ii) the distance between the 
municipality where an inspection will be carried out and the nearest GRT. Thus, the greater the distance 
between a municipality and a GRT, the less likely that companies in that municipality will be inspected. 
However, the availability of a larger number of labor inspectors in municipalities reduces the importance 
of the distance between them and a GRT. Thus, the empirical strategy adopted by the authors was that of 
comparing  the  differential  impact  of  the  distance  between  a  municipality  and  the  nearest  GRT  on  the 

10 

 
variables  related  to  the  municipality’s  labor  market  through  states  with  different  numbers  of  labor 
inspectors available (ALMEIDA and CARNEIRO, 2012). 

Almeida and Carneiro (2012) found that increased labor inspections in a municipality, which was 
measured  as  the  interaction  between  the  distance  to  the  nearest  GRT  and  the  number  of  inspectors  per 
firm  in  the  state,  have  the  following  effects  on  its  labor  market:  i)  increase  in  formal  employment;  ii) 
reduction  in  informal  employment;  iii)  increase  in  unemployment;  iv)  decrease  in  self-employment;  v) 
reduction in the wages of formal workers;  and vi) increase in the income of self-employed workers (the 
vast majority of whom are informal workers). 
 
3. Methodology 
 

This article uses the study by Almeida and Carneiro (2012), which was presented in the previous 
section, as the base for the creation of the instrumental variables. However, the methodology is different 
because we believe that the most appropriate method to be used is the Two-stage Least Squares Method 
(2SLS). 
 

3.1 Data 
 

We will use data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses to create the variable  ‘proportion of working 
children and adolescents in the 10-17 age range,’ which will be our main dependent variable. To create 
this variable, we calculated the total number of children and adolescents from 10 to 17 years old engaged 
in  any  activity  for  one  hour  or  more  during  the  reference  week  and  divided  by  the  total  number  of 
children  and  adolescents  in  that  age  bracket.  These  data  were  obtained  from  the  Automatic  Recovery 
System  of  the  Brazilian  Institute  for  Geography  and  Statistics  (SIDRA)9.  To  calculate  the  number  of 
working  children  and  adolescents  in  2000,  we  used  data  from  table  2954,  which  contains  the  variable 
“People aged 10 or above who were occupied in the reference week by education, sex and age brackets.” 
For 2010, we used data from table 3907, which contains the variable “Total number of people from 10 to 
17  years  old  who  were  either  occupied  or  unoccupied  during  the  reference  week,  by  age  and  literacy 
status.”  

The  data  on  labor  inspection  were  obtained  from  the  Ministry  of  Labor  through  the  Labor 
Inspection  Secretariat  (SIT).  Those  data  contain:  i)  the  number  of  labor  inspectors  (AFTs)  by  state  in 
2001 and 2010; ii) the location of Regional Labor Offices and Superintendences;  and iii) the number of 
inspected establishments in the municipality in 2002 and 201010. The labor inspectors work at Regional 
Labor Offices (GRTs) and at Regional Labor Superintendences (SRTs).  

Another variable that was used, which is related to labor inspection, is the distance (as measured 
in hours by car) between each municipality and the closest Regional Labor Office or Superintendence in 
the state. This variable was calculated using the Google Maps tool11.  

The total number of companies in 2000 and 2010 by municipality and state was obtained from the 

Central Register of Enterprises.  

The  control  variables  were  obtained  from  municipal-level  data  available  in  the  Ipeadata 
database12. These variables include per capita GDP, share of agriculture in the GDP, share of industry in 
the  GDP,  share  of  services  in  the  GDP,  geographic  area  as  measured  in  square  kilometers,  number  of 
beneficiaries of the Bolsa Familia Program13, current transfers of state taxes to municipalities, transfers to 
municipalities  related  to  the  value-added  tax  (ICMS)  and  the  municipal  expenses  by  function  in:  i)

of Labor. For 2010, the data were exclusively collected for this study.

management and planning; ii) care and welfare; iii) communications; iv) education and culture; v) legal 
spending; vi) municipal spending; vii) health care and sanitation; and viii) transportation.  

Moreover,  we  used  data  on  the  institutional  development  of  municipalities,  as  published  by  the 
Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE)14. These data include an index of access to justice 
in  a  municipality,  an  index  of  the  managing  capacity  of  a  municipality,  and  an  index  of  political 
concentration in a municipality. 

According  to  Naritomi,  Soares  and  Assunção  (2012),  the  index  of  access  to  justice  was  created 
based on a definition of access to justice proposed by the IBGE. The index ranges from 0 to 3 and was 
calculated  based  on  the  sum  of  three  binary  variables  representing  the  existence,  in  a  municipality,  of 
Small  Claims  Courts,  Guardianship  Councils  for  children  and  adolescents  and  a  Consumer  Protection 
Committee. The index was calculated based on 2001 data. 

According  to  Naritomi,  Soares  and  Assunção  (2012),  the  index  of  the  managing  capacity  of  a 
municipality  is  calculated  by  the  IBGE  and  its  purpose  is  measuring  the  quality  of  the  municipal 
administration.  It  is  also  used  by  the  Ministry  of  Planning  as  a  tool  to  monitor  the  administrative 
performance  of  municipalities.  Still  according  to  these  authors,  the  index  of  political  concentration  in  a 
municipality is the Gini coefficient for land distribution in Brazil, which was calculated in 1996 based on 
data  from  the  Agricultural  Census.  The  Gini  coefficient  for  land  can  be  used  as  a  measure  of  political 
concentration  because,  as  argued  by  Acemoglu  and  Robinson  (apud  Naritomi,  Soares  and  Assunção, 
2012),  individuals  don’t  need  to  belong  to  political  institutions  to  exercise  political  power.  The 
concentration of economic resources in the hands of an elite is also a source of political power.    

Finally,  the  Municipal  Human  Development  Index  (IDHM)  calculated  by  the  United  Nations 
Development Program (UNDP) was also used. This index includes three human development indicators: 
longevity, education and income.  
 
3.2 Empirical Strategy 

 
To analyze how labor inspections at municipal level affect child labor, initially we wanted to use 
the  number  of  companies  inspected  in  a  municipality  as  a  measure  of  labor  inspection.  The  problem  is 
that this variable cannot be defined at random. Therefore, since  it is not an exogenous variable, we will 
use econometric techniques in order to fix the problem. 

How labor inspectors define the companies they will inspect has already been discussed in section 
2.  We  have  seen  that  despite  the  fact  that  inspection  actions  are  carried  out  based  on  plans,  reports  of 
violations  of  labor  laws  continue  to  guide  the  work  of  inspectors  (ALMEIDA  and  CARNEIRO,  2012; 
CORSEUIL,  ALMEIDA  &  CARNEIRO,  2012;  ILO,  2010b).  Almeida  and  Carneiro  (2012)  also  argue 
that in municipalities that are more developed institutionally the number of inspections may be higher. 

To  solve  this  problem,  we  need  to  find  a  variable  that  is  related  to  the  number  of  inspected 
companies but is not conditioned to the number of reports of violations of labor laws. For this purpose, 
we  must  understand  how  inspections  are  carried  out  in  Brazil.  In  the  section  2,  we  saw  that  labor 
inspections are carried out by labor inspectors (AFTs) working at SRTEs and GRTEs. A labor inspector 
travels by car from the SRTE of GRTE where he or she works to where an inspection is to be carried out. 
Most  municipalities  don’t  have  a  SRTE  or  GRTE,  meaning  that  labor  inspectors  must  travel  from  the 
municipality in which they work to the one where a company to be inspected is located.  

This shows that two important factors must be taken into account when analyzing how inspections 
are  carried  out:  (i)  the  number  of  labor  inspectors  by  state;  and  (ii)  the  distance  between  an  SRTE  or 
GRTE  and  the  municipality  where  a  company  to  be  inspected  is  located.  Municipalities  located  at  a 
greater distance from an SRTE or GRTE are less likely to be visited by labor inspectors as compared to 
municipalities that are closer to them. Furthermore, this restriction is more important in areas where less 
labor inspectors are available. 

Thus,  the  hypothesis  of  this  study  is  that  the  number  of  labor  inspectors  by  state  is  positively 
correlated with the number of inspected companies and that the distance is negatively correlated with the 

                                                           
14 These data are used in Naritomi, Soares and Assunção (2012) and were provided by Rodrigo Soares. 

 
number of inspected companies, but  the number of labor inspectors by state and the distance factor are 
uncorrelated with reports of child labor. If this is the case, we can use the number of inspectors by state 
and the distance factor as instrumental variables for the number of inspected companies. 

Thus,  the  best  method  to  estimate  the  parameters  of  our  model  is  the  Two-stage  Least  Squares 

12 

Method (2SLS).  

 

3.3 The Model 
 

Our  goal  is  to  analyze the effect  of labor inspections on  child labor in  2000 and 2010.  For  each 
year, four models were created that differ among them according to the dependent variable. Our primary 
dependent variable is the logarithm of the proportion of working children and adolescents from 10 to 17 
in each year. However, the analysis was also performed for other age groups. We thus have the following 
dependent variables: i) logarithm of the proportion of working children and adolescents 10 to 17 years old 
in 2000; ii) logarithm of the proportion of working children and adolescents 10-14 in 2000; iii) logarithm 
of the proportion of 15-year-old working adolescents in 2000; iv) logarithm of the proportion of working 
adolescents  aged  16  and  17  years  old  in  2000;  v)  logarithm  of  the  proportion  of  working  children  and 
adolescents 10-17 years old in 2010; vi) logarithm of the proportion of working children and adolescents 
between 10 and 13 in 2010; vii) logarithm of the proportion of working adolescents 14 and 15 years old 
in 2010; and viii) logarithm of the proportion of working adolescents 16 and 17 years old in 201015. 

To measure labor inspections, three variables were created. To calculate the first variable (which 
in the model we refer to as 𝑙𝑛_𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑐), we multiplied the number of inspected companies in a municipality 
by 100 and divided the result by the total number of companies in the municipality. We added a unit to 
this result and then calculated its logarithm. To calculate the second variable (which in the model we refer 
to  as 𝑙𝑛_𝑎𝑓𝑡),  we  multiplied  the  total  number  of  labor  inspectors  (AFTs)  available  in  a  state  by  10,000 
and divided the result by the total number of companies in the state. We then calculated the logarithm of 
this result. To create the third variable (which we refer to as  distance), we calculated the travel time (in 
hours) by car between a municipality where a company to be inspected is located and the closest Regional 
Labor Superintendence or Office. 

As shown in section 3.2, inspection is possibly an endogenous variable. To solve this problem, we 
use the variables 𝑙𝑛_𝑎𝑓𝑡 and distance as instruments for 𝑙𝑛_𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑐. We thus use the two-stage least squares 
method (2SLS).  

In the first stage, we estimated the following model:  
 
𝑙𝑛⁡_𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑚𝑠 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑠 + 𝛼2𝑙𝑛⁡_𝑎𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑠 + 𝛼3(𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑠 ⁡ × ⁡ 𝑙𝑛⁡_𝑎𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑠) + 𝜹𝐗𝑚𝑠 + 𝑣𝑚𝑠                                                                                                                       

(1) 
 
where m represents the municipality, s represents states and the Federal District, v is the error term and 𝐗 
is a matrix composed of the model’s control variables, namely: per capita GDP, share of agriculture in the 
GDP, share of industry in the GDP, share of services in the GDP, geographic area as measured in square 
kilometers,  number  of  beneficiaries  of  the  Bolsa  Familia  Program,  current  transfers  of  state  taxes  to 
municipalities, transfers to municipalities related to the value-added (ICMS) tax, municipal  expenses by 
function16,  an  index  of  access  to  justice  in  the  municipality,  an  index  of  the  managing  capacity  of  the 
municipality,  an  index  of  political  concentration  in  the  municipality,  the  Human  Development  Index  of 
the municipality and dummies for the states and the Federal District (UF).  

 
 
 

                                                           
15  As  already  stated  in  section  3.1,  these  data  were  obtained  from  the  SIDRA  system.  In  this  system,  age  brackets  were  not 
defined in the same way for 2000 and 2010. So while we have an age bracket with children and adolescents aged between 10 
and 14 years old and another one with adolescents aged 15 in 2000, we have an age group with children and adolescents aged 
between 10 and 13 years old and another one with adolescents aged 14 and 15 in 2010.  
16 Section 3.1 has all the expenses included.

In the second stage, we estimated the following model: 

                             𝑙𝑛⁡_𝑌𝑚𝑠 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1ln⁡_𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑐̂

𝑚𝑠 + 𝜹𝐗𝑚𝑠 + 𝑢𝑚𝑠                              (2) 

 
where  m  represents  the  municipality,  s  is  the  unit  of  the  federation,  𝑢  is  the  error  term,  𝐗  is  the  matrix 
composed  of  the  control  variables17,  ln⁡_𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑐̂   is  the  inspection  estimated  from  the  first  stage  and  𝑙𝑛⁡_𝑌 
represents the logarithm of the proportion of working children and adolescents. As stated at the beginning 
of this section, the variable 𝑙𝑛⁡_𝑌 actually represents eight different dependent variables. For each one of 
them we estimate the model’s parameters using the 2SLS method.  

Unfortunately, there is a discrepancy in the data that were used to create the variables 𝑙𝑛_𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑐 and 
𝑙𝑛_𝑎𝑓𝑡 for the year 2000. The data for the number of inspected companies are from 2002 and those for 
the  number  of  inspectors  available  by  state  are  from  2001.  However,  because  our  empirical  study  is 
intended to estimate the effect of inspections on child labor considering variations in the distance between 
each  municipality  and  the  nearest  Regional  Labor  Superintendence  or  Office  in  states  with  a  varying 
number of labor inspectors available18, we believe that these discrepancies are not relevant.     
 
4. Results 

 

In this section, we present the results of applying the two-stage least squares method to estimate 
the  effect  of  labor  inspections  on  child  labor.  Altogether,  we  have  eight  results  that  differ  among  them 
according  to  the  dependent  variable  that  was  used.  The  dependent  variables  can  be  differentiated  from 
each  other  according  to  the  year  (2000  or  2010)  and  to  the  age  group  of  the  working  children  and 
adolescents. 

The  two  tables  presented  in  this  section  contain  the  coefficients  of  the  main  variables  of  the 
estimated  model.  In  the  first  stage,  we  have  the  following  exogenous  variables:  i)  distance;  ii)  𝑙𝑛_𝑎𝑓𝑡; 
iii)⁡𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 × 𝑙𝑛_𝑎𝑓𝑡.  The  first  two  variables  were  defined  in  section  3.3  and  the  third  variable 
represents the interaction between the first two variables19. These are the instrumental variables that were 
used  in  the  first  stage.  The  dependent  variable  in  the  first  stage  is  𝑙𝑛_𝐹𝑖𝑠𝑐,  which  is  our  measure  of 
inspection.  The  estimated  value  of  this  variable  in  the  first  stage  is  used  to  estimate  the  effect  of 
inspection on child labor in the second stage. 

Table  2  presents  the  results  of  applying  the  two-stage  least  squares  method  to  four  age  ranges 
using data for 2000. The coefficient of the distance variable has a negative sign, which is in line with the 
expected  result,  namely,  that  the  greater  the  distance  between  a  municipality  and  a  Regional  Labor 
Superintendence  or  Office,  the  smaller  the  number  of  inspected  companies  in  a  municipality.  All  these 
results are statistically significant at a probability of 5%. The coefficient of the 𝑙𝑛_𝑎𝑓𝑡_2000 variable has 
a positive sign in all age groups, which is also in line with the expected result, namely, that the higher the 
number  of  inspectors  available  in  a  state,  the  higher  the  number  of  inspected  companies  located  in 
municipalities  in  that  state.  These  results  are  statistically  significant  at  1%.  The  coefficient  of  the 
interaction variable is not statistically significant in any of the age groups, not even at a probability level 
of 
10%. 

                                                           
17 These are the same variables of the first stage. 
18 The number of inspectors available by state in 2001 and 2010 can be seen in section 2.1. 
19 We put the interaction between the two variables because it was used in the study by Almeida and Carneiro (2012), which 
we used as the base for the creation of ours exogenous variables, and also to capture all the possible effects of the variables.

Table 2 also shows the results for the second stage. The result for children and adolescents 
from  10  to  17  years  old,  which  is  shown  in  the  second  column  of  the  table,  reveals  that  a  1% 
increase in inspections reduced the number of working children and adolescents by 0.22% in 2000. 
This result is statistically significant at 1%. According to the Census, there were 3,935,495 working 
children and adolescents in this age range in 2000. Thus, this result indicates that a 1% increase in 
inspections would remove approximately 8,658 children and adolescents from work. 

For  the  10  -  14  years  old  group,  shown  in  the  third  column  of  Table  2,  a  1%  increase  in 
inspections reduced the number of working children and adolescents by 0.45%. Data from the 2000 
Census show that there were 1,142,438 working children and adolescents in this age range in Brazil 
in  that  year.  Thus,  a  1%  increase  in  inspections  suggests  that  approximately  5,140  children  and 
adolescents would be removed from work. 

For 15-year-old  adolescents,  the result for the second stage shown in  the fourth column of 
Table  3  suggests  that  a  1%  increase  in  inspections  reduced  the  number  of  these  adolescents  by 
0.19%  in  2000.  For  this  age  group,  the  2000  Census  data  show  that  there  were  649,042  working 
adolescents  in  Brazil.  So,  a  1%  increase  in  inspections  indicates  that  1,233  adolescents  were 
removed from work.   

 Finally,  for  adolescents  in  the  16-17  age  range,  a  1%  increase  in  inspections  reduced  the 
number  of  working  adolescents  in  this  age  group  by  approximately  0.09%.  According  to  Census 
data,  there  were  2,144,014  working  adolescents  in  this  age  group  in  Brazil  in  2000.  Thus,  a  1% 
increase  in  inspections  results  in  the  removal  of  approximately  1,929  adolescents  aged  16  and  17 
years old from irregular working conditions.  

The results for the year 2000 show that the effect of inspections was higher in reducing child 
labor for the 10-14 age range. In addition, this effect decreases as the children and adolescents grow 
older.  

It  is  to  be  expected  that  more  inspections  are  carried  out  in  municipalities  that  are  more 
developed institutionally. However, this greater institutional development can also be an incentive 
for companies to comply with the law and thus use less child labor. To control for this effect, some 
indexes of the institutional development of municipalities were used, including an index of access 
to justice. It is expected that the higher this index, the more intense the inspections. Analyzing the 
first stage for all age brackets in 2000, it was observed that the signs are consistent with what was to 
be expected and is statistically significant at 1%. As for the second stage, it could be expected that 
the greater the access to justice, the less child labor. However, for the age groups where the signs is 
in line with what was to be expected, the coefficients are not statistically significant.  

The economic status of municipalities can influence the number of companies operating in 
each city. It is to be expected that wealthier municipalities will have more companies operating as 
compared to  less wealthy  ones. The fact  that more companies are operating in  a municipality can 
lead to more inspections being carried out. To control for this effect, we used the share of each of 
the sectors of the economy in the GDP. However, results for the first stage are not in line with what 
would be expected.  

Human  development  in  a  municipality  can  affect  child  labor.  It  is  to  be  expected  that  the 
more a municipality is developed in this area, the less child labor. To control for this effect, we used 
the Human Development Index of the municipality. For the first two age  ranges, the results are in 
line with what we expected, but in none of the cases the coefficients are statistically significant.  

It is believed that child labor rates are lower in municipalities with more beneficiaries of the 
Bolsa  Familia  program.  However,  the  coefficient  only  has  a  negative  sign  and  is  statistically 
significant for the last age range.  

Some  municipal  expenditures,  such  as  spending  on  education,  culture,  communications, 
judiciary  costs,  health  care,  among  others,  were  also  used  as  control  variables.  However,  most  of 
these  variables  were  not  statistically  significant  for  any  of  the  age  ranges.  Finally,  dummies  were 
used for the states and Federal District. 

16 

 

Table 3 shows the results for 2010. For the first stage, the coefficient of the distance variable 
has a negative sign and is statistically significant at 1% in all the age range analyzed. The negative 
sign  of  the  coefficient  shows  that  the  greater  the  distance  between  a  municipality  and  the  nearest 
Regional  Labor  Superintendence  or  Office,  the  lower  the  number  of  inspected  companies  in  the 
municipality. 

The  coefficient  of  the  variable  𝑙𝑛_𝑎𝑓𝑡_2010  has  a  positive  sign  and  is  also  statistically 
significant at 1% in all the age ranges analyzed. The positive sign shows that the higher the number 
of inspectors in a state, the higher the number of inspected companies located in municipalities in 
the  state.  The  coefficient  of  the  variable  𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 × 𝑙𝑛_𝑎𝑓𝑡_2010  has  a  positive  sign  and  is 
statistically significant at 1% in all age groups.  

Table  3  also  presents  the  results  for  the  second  stage  estimation  in  2010.  For  children  and 
adolescents in the 10-17 age range, the result shows that a 1% increase in inspections reduced the 
number  of  working  children  and  adolescents  in  this  age  group  by  0.26%,  which  means  removing 
8,856 children and adolescents from irregular working conditions. 

For the 10-13 age range the coefficient shows that a 1% increase in inspections reduced the 
number of working children and adolescents by 0.66%. The 2010 Census indicated that there were 
710,139 working children and adolescents in that age bracket and so 4,686 children and adolescents 
10 to 13 years old were removed from irregular working conditions as a result of inspections.  

The  result  for  adolescents  between  14  and  15  years  old  shows  that  a  1%  increase  in 
inspections reduced the number of working adolescents by 0.41%, representing a reduction of 3,642 
adolescents from irregular working conditions in 2010. 

For  the  16-17  age  bracket,  a  1%  increase  in  inspections  reduced  the  number  of  working 

adolescents by 0.08% in 2010. However, this result is not statistically significant at a 10% level. 

The results show that the effect of inspections on reducing child labor in 2010 is higher for 
younger children and adolescents (10-13 years old) and that their impact decreases as these children 
and adolescents grow older. 

In summary, the results show that more inspections reduced child labor in all the age ranges 
that  were  analyzed  in  2000  and  2010.  All  these  results  were  statistically  significant,  except  for 
adolescents from 16 to 17 years old in 2010.

5. Conclusion 
 

The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of labor inspection in reducing child 
labor using data from population censuses of 2000 and 2010 by municipality. We ran the two-stage 
least squares method, using the distance between each municipality and the nearest Regional Labor 
Superintendences  or  Offices  and  the  number  of  labor  inspectors  available  in  the  state  as 
instrumental variables. Analyses for both 2000 and 2010 showed that more inspections reduce child 
labor. 

The  analyses  were  carried  out  by  age  ranges.  In  the  two  years  that  were  analyzed,  it  was 
seen that the effect of inspections was greater in the age range of younger children and adolescents 
and that this effect diminishes as these children grow older.  

Thus,  in  2000 it  was  found  that  a  1%  increase  in  inspections  decreased  child  labor  among 
children  and  adolescents  in  the  10-14  age  bracket  by  0.45%,  while  reductions  of  0.19%  and  of 
approximately 0.09% were observed among 15-year-old adolescents and adolescents aged from 16 
to 17 years old, respectively. Analyzing the 10-17 age bracket, a 1% increase in inspections led to a 
decrease of 0.22% in child labor. 

Based on these results, it was estimated that approximately  8,658 children and adolescents 
from 10 to 17 years old, 5,140 children and adolescents from 10 to 14 years old, 1,233 fifteen-year-
old adolescents and 1,929 adolescents aged 16 and 17 were removed from work in 2000. 

In  relation  to  2010,  it  was  found  that  a  1%  increase  in  inspections  reduced  the  number  of 
working children and adolescents in the 10-13, 14-15 and 16-17 age ranges by 0.66%, 0.41% and 
0.08%,  respectively.  For  the  10-17  age  group,  the  reduction  was  0.26%.  These  results  were 
statistically significant at 1%, except for the 16-17 years old.  

Based on these results, it was estimated that approximately 8,856 children and adolescents 
aged  from  10  to  17  years  old,  4,686  children  and  adolescents  in  the  10-13  age  bracket  and  3,642 
adolescents aged from 14 to 15 years old were removed from work in 2010. 

These  results  show  that  labor  inspections  are  an  important  mechanism  for  fighting  child 

labor. Therefore, intensifying them can be a good strategy to speed up reductions in child labor.  

One of the limitations of this study was that it was not possible to obtain robust results by 
creating a Panel with data from the two years that were analyzed, namely, 2000 and 2010. This is so 
because  there  is  no  sufficient  variability  in  the  data  that  were  used  to  define  the  instrumental 
variables.  The  distance  between  municipalities  does  not  change  over  time  and  changes  in  the 
number of labor inspectors by state were not sufficient to capture any effect. We therefore hope that 
further research on the subject will be carried out and that a way to overcome this difficulty will be 
found.
