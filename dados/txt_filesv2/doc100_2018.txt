ABSTRACT 

This  paper’s  objective  is  to  contribute  to  the  debate  on  relations  between  China  and  Latin 
America  (LA).  The  question  is  whether  the  trade  agreements  between  these  regions  are 
complementary  or  if  they  strengthen  the  dependence  of  Latin  America  on  the  international 
scene.  For  this  purpose  we  aim  to  observe  the  impacts  of  China's  growth  in  LA  countries 
through  the  Computable  General  Equilibrium  model  (CGE).  The  chinese  growth  has  been 
simulated  through  an  expansion  of  China's  capital  stock,  as  has  occurred  over  the  past  few 
decades. The results point to a pattern of reprimarization of the export agenda and decline in 
the  industrial  activity  of  the  selected  countries  of  the  LA,  mainly  in  the  sectors  of  high 
technological intensity.  In addition,  there is  an increase in  welfare in  the  LA, mainly due to 
gains in the terms of trade (commodity boom).

RESUMO 

O  presente  trabalho  pretende  contribuir  para  o  debate  a  respeito  das  relações  entre  China  e 
América Latina (AL), a questão que se coloca é se os acordos comerciais entre essas regiões 
são  mutualmente  benéficos  ou  se  reforçam  a  dependência  da  AL  no  cenário  internacional. 
Para isto objetiva-se observar os impactos do crescimento da China nos países da AL através 
do modelo de equilíbrio geral computável. O crescimento chinês foi simulado através de uma 
expansão do estoque de capital deste país, tal como ocorreu ao longo das últimas décadas. Os 
resultados  apontam  para  um  padrão  de  reprimarização  da  pauta  exportadora  e  queda  na 
atividade  industrial  dos  países  selecionados  da  AL,  principalmente  nos  setores  de  alta 
densidade tecnológica. Além disso, observa-se o aumento de bem-estar na AL principalmente 
por ganhos nos termos de troca (boom das commodities).

1.  INTRODUCTION 

 
China  is  one  of  the  main  trading  partners  of  Latin  America  (LA).  Trade  relations  between 
these  regions  are  “strategic”,  since  LA  has  abundant  natural  resources  that  are  essential  to 
Chinese  industries  such  as  soybeans,  iron  ore  and  oil.  In  contrast,  LA  represents  a  large 
consumer market for Chinese products, which are characterized by manufactured goods.

Beside  trade  flows,  China  has  been  intensifying  its  diplomatic  and  political  relations  with 
governments  of  Latin  American  countries.  "Win-win"  expressions  are  used  by  Chinese 
representatives to highlight the mutual benefits in relations between China and LA. 
 
In 2008 China launched the so-called first White Paper on Latin America and the Caribbean, 
and  in  2016  the  second  one.  Both  documents  highlight  where  there  could  be  considerable 
cooperation  among  these  regions,  such  as  greater  political  proximity,  intensification  of 
bilateral  trade,  investment  in  productive  infrastructure,  financial  support,  social  support  and 
exchanges, cultural, international cooperation, peace and security agreements (China, 2016).  
 
Chinese  investments  in  the  LA  are  based  on  participation  in  public  services  concessions 
(energy,  telecommunications  and  transportation)  and  direct  investments  based  on  financing 
projects to consolidate road, rail and mineral resources (Silveira, 2017). 
 
However,  the  question  is  whether  the  trade  and  investment  agreements  of  these  regions  are 
mutually  beneficial  or  if  strengthen  the  dependence  of  Latin  America  on  the  international 
scene,  considering  that  LA  is  a  region  characterized  by  exporting  primary  goods  and 
technologically  dependent  from  the  foreign  market  since  the  beginnings  of  its  colonization 
(Bázquez-Lidoy,  Rodríguez  and  Santiso,  2006,  Jenkins,  Peters  and  Moreira,  2008,  Ferchen, 
2011, Cintra, 2013, Kim and Lee, 2014 and Silveira, 2017). 
 
To contribute to this debate, this paper seeks to analyze the interdependence structure of trade 
relations between selected LA countries- Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, 
Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay  and  Venezuela- and China 
through a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) approach using the Global Trade Analysis 
Project (GTAP), version 9.0, with 2011 how reference year. 
 
The  empirical  strategy  is  to  simulate  the  effect  of  the  growth  of  the  Chinese  economy  by 
expanding  its  capital  stock  by  10%,  which  corresponds  to  the  average  annual  growth  of  its 
capital stock in recent decades, according to Penn World Table 9.0. The aim is to evaluate the 
impact of the growth of the Chinese economy in the sectorial production, exports and imports 
and on welfare variation in the selected countries of the LA and in China itself.  
 
In addition to this introduction, this paper presents a brief review of the relationship between 
LA and China in  the second section, the third section presents a description of the database 
and the GTAP model, the fourth brings the results of the model, and finally, the fifth section 
brings the final considerations. 
 
 

2.  CHINESE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ITS IMPACT IN LATIN AMERICA 
 

China  has  undergone  considerable  changes  in  its  economic  and  social  structure,  especially 
since the 1990s. Chinese industrial development is the result of planning, the famous phrase 
of  the  ruler  Deng  Xiaoping  in  1978  "it  does  not  matter  whether  the  cat  is  white  or  black, 
provided he takes the mouse”, illustrates the Chinese economy, which, in a parallel among a 
centralized  economy  and  a  market  economy,  is  now  the  world's  second  largest  economy  in 
terms of production (Cintra, 2013).

From  the  structural  point  of  view,  a  number  of  factors  responsible  for  Chinese  success  are 
highlighted,  such  as  the  establishment  of  Special  Economic  Zones,  which  consisted  in  the 
creation of strategically concentrated clusters near Hong Kong to attract foreign investments 
as  well  as  positive  spillovers,  gradual  opening  of  China's  trade,  intellectual  appropriation  of 
production  techniques,  government  investment  in  science  and  technology,  and  other 
incentives (Nonnenberg, 2010). 
 
The increase in China's productive capacity was based on an "extensive factor of production" 
model,  ie  the  widespread  use  of  cheap  labor  and  growth  in  investment.  China  grew  mainly 
through  high  capital  plant  investment,  gross  fixed  capital  formation  increased  from  29%  to 
42% of GDP over the period 1980 to 2010 (Beim, 2011). 
 
In this context of expansion, China has enlarged its trade and financial relations with several 
countries, including the Latin American ones. Trade relations between LA and China began to 
grow  in  2002,  with  China  joining  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  and  intensified  in 
2004  with  Hu  Jintao's  visit  to  LA  in  which  trade  and  investment  agreements  were  signed 
(Medeiros and Cintra, 2015). 
 
In the period between 2000 to  2016, it is  possible to  observe heterogeneities in  the share of 
exports  from  the  selected  countries  from  LA  to  China.  There  are  Latin  American  countries 
that  do  not  have  a  definite  trajectory  of  growth  of  their  exports,  like  Colombia,  Panama, 
Paraguay and Venezuela. Chile, Peru, and Brazil stand out for their significant increase in this 
post-crisis participation of 2008 (Figure 1).

Figure 2 shows that the selected LA countries show a growth trend of imports from China over 
the  period  2000-2016.  With  the  exception  of  Costa  Rica,  most  countries  presented  in  2016 
more  than  16%  of  their imports  from  China.  It  is  noted  that China  has  a  larger  share  of  the 
total imported by the selected countries of the LA compared to yours exports.

China,  on  the  other  hand,  is  less  "dependent"  of  LA  in  terms  of  trade  flows,  as  shown  in 
Figures 3 and 4. 
 
Participations  of  selected  LA  countries  in  the  volume  exported  and  imported  by  China  vary 
between  0%  and  4.5%.  Regarding  the  destination  of  Chinese  exports,  Brazil,  Mexico, 
Panama, Chile and Argentina stand out. As for the origin of Chinese imports, Brazil and Chile 
stand out. 
 
There  is  a  reduction  in  the  share  of  Chinese  exports  to  selected  LA  countries  from  2010, 
which can be explained by the augment in total exports from China to other countries and not 
by  the  loss  of  importance  of  Chinese  sales  to  LA  once  they  grew  significantly  in  the  post-
crisis period of 2008. 
 
Costa Rica stands out for drop sales to China in 2015-2016. This may be linked to Intel's exit 
from Costa Rica in 2014.

In  addition  to  the  differences  in  the  amount  of  exports  and  imports,  there  are  qualitative 
differences  in  the  commercial  pattern  of  the  LA  and  China,  which  reflects  a  primary  export 
structure of LA, to the detriment of the industrial standard and greater technological content 
from China, as shown in Figures 5 and 6.

It is noteworthy that Latin American countries, with the exception of Costa Rica and Mexico, 
exhibit  a  pattern  of  exports  of  primary  products  and  of  medium/low  technology  industrial 
products to China. The primary products correspond to the greater part of the export portion 
of  Argentina,  Bolivia,  Colombia,  Mexico,  Peru  and  Venezuela.  Mexico  and  the  rest  of  the 
World  have  a  more  diversified  export  agenda  with  China,  presenting  parcels  of  the  most 
distributed  exports  among  the  sectors  of  their  economy.  Costa  Rica  is  the  only  country  that 
has most of its exports to China from the high-tech industrial sector in 2011.

With regard to imports from China, their technological pattern is opposite to exports to China, 
focusing mainly on industrial segments: high, medium and low technology products. Primary 
products and services correspond to less than 10% of the imports in the selected countries. 

 

In general, there is a greater commercial dependence of the LA with China than the opposite, 
as well as an antagonism in the commercial pattern between these regions, which reflects in a 
primary  export  structure  of  the  LA  in  detriment  of  the  pattern  of  industrial  trade  and  of  the 
greater technologic content of imports from China.  
 
The  antagonism  in  trade  relations  between  LA  and  China  can  be  explained  by  the  different 
trajectories  of  economic  growth  and  external  insertion  adopted  by  these  two  economies, 
especially  since  the  1990s  (Barbosa,  2011).  While  China  concentrated  investments  to 
restructure  its  productive  structure  in  industrial  follow-ups,  LA's  industrial  policies  cooled 
down in this period. 
 
However trade relations between LA and China are controversial. Blázquez-Lidoy, Rodríguez 
and  Santiso  (2006)  evaluate  whether  China  can  be  seen  as  an  "angel"  or  "demon"  for 
emerging economies. In the short term, these authors state that China would have a positive 
influence on Latin America, especially in commodity-exporting countries, due to the "demand 
shock", with improved terms of trade and higher exported volumes (commodity boom). The 
negative  short-term  effect  would  be  mainly  in  countries  with  a  competing  export  and 
production  pattern  of  Chinese  products,  such  as  Mexico,  Costa  Rica  and  Brazil.  In  the  long 
run, though, the authors state that there is  an incentive to  the reprimarization the production 
and export agenda the AL, which would lead these economies to become more vulnerable to 
shocks (recessions and booms) in commodity prices. 
 
Jenkins, Peters and Moreira (2008) also analysed the perspective that trades between LA and 
China  brings  winners  and  losers.  In  addition,  the  authors  question  the  thesis  that  producers 
and exporters of raw materials, such as South American countries  - Argentina, Brazil, Chile 
and  Venezuela  -  were  the  "winners"  and  that  Mexico  and  the  Central  American  countries, 
specialized in chains of merchandise, were the losers. The authors drew attention to the fact 
that  the  bilateral  trade  nature  of  LA  and  China  reproduce  the  core-periphery  pattern  of  the 
exchange  of  manufactures  for  raw  materials,  in  addition  to  not  taking  into  account  the 
ecological, economic and social sustainability of these relations in the long run. 
 

3.  DATABASE AND METHODOLOGY 

 

3.1  Database 

 

The database is provided by the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), a project coordinated 
by  the  Department  of  Agricultural  Economics  at  Pardue  University  in  the  Center  of  Global 
Trade  Analysis.  The  GTAP  has  a  standard  multi-region  and  multi-sector  model  of  CGE 
analysis,  with  140  regions  and  57  commodities.  RunGTAP  software  and  version  9  of  the 
GTAP static model, which has 2011 as the reference year, are used.  
 
The  140  regions  that  make  up  the  GTAP  base  were  aggregated  in  16  regions:  Argentina, 
Bolivia,  Brazil,  Chile,  China,  Colombia,  Costa  Rica,  Ecuador,  Mexico,  Panama,  Paraguay, 
Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, rest of Latin America5 and rest of the World6. 
                                                           
5 Rest of South America, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, rest of Central America and Dominican 
Republic.

The primary  factors of production are divided into three  categories:  land,  capital,  and labor. 
Labor and capital are movable factors of production, whose mobility is given by an elasticity 
of  constant  transformation.  The  land  factor  is  immobile  and  is  present  only  in  the  primary 
goods production sector. 
 
The  sector  aggregation  of  the  57  sectors  of  the  GTAP  base  is  fundamented  on  the  OECD 
(2011)  parameters  that  defines  four  categories  of  technological  intensity  for  industrial 
products:  low,  medium-low,  medium-high  and  high  technology.  In  addition,  the  services 
sector  and  the  primary  goods  production  sector  are  analyzed  separately.  The  products 
corresponding to each sector are presented in Annex 1. 
 
3.2 The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) 
 
CGE models describe all economic activities such as consumption, production, employment, 
taxes, domestic and foreign trade, and savings. These models involve two equations structures 
given by countries' social accounting matrices and by the microfoundation economy, in order 
to characterize and match these matrices among the different agents (Castilho, 1994). 
 
The  GTAP  model  is  a  multi-region  and  multisectorial  CGE  model.  The  assumptions  of  the 
GTAP are perfect competition and constant returns to scale. Figure 7 shows the structure of 
an economy modeled by GTAP. 
 
At the top of the figure is the "regional household", responsible for capturing and distributing 
all the expenses and income of the economy, coming from the payment of the firms by the use 
of  production  factors  (VOA)  and  the  collection  of  taxes  (TAX),  and  which  forming  the 
regional income. 

 

The regional income is distributed to private household (PRIVEXP), government (GOVEXP) 
and global savings (SAVE), based on the Constant Function of Difference of Elasticity (CDE) 
non-homothetic utilities functions, flexible to changes in prices and income (Liu et al., 1998). 
 
Another  agent  is  the  sector  of  goods  and  services  production  (producer),  that  agent  has  its 
revenues  from  the  sale  of  its  products  to  private  household  (VDPA),  the  government 
(VDGA),  other  producers  (VDFA)  and  the  rest  of  the  World  (VXMD).  Besides  that,  the 
productive  sector  is  financed  by  global  savings  (NETINV).  Production  sector  expenses  are

used to pay the primary factors for production of land, capital and labor (VOA), for domestic 
intermediate inputs (VDFA) and imported (VIFA).

Firms  production  functions  are  modeled  by  Leontief-type  technology,  with  constant 
substitution  elasticity,  both  to  for  the  intermediate  goods  demands  (inputs  from  other 
industries  or  from  them)  and  for  the  ''production  primary  factors  (land,  capital  and  labor) 
(Hertel et al., 2012). Moreover, by separability hypothesis, substitution between intermediate 
goods and production factors is not allowed. 
 
The  bilateral  trade  for  intermediate  goods  is  outlined  by  the  Armington  assumption,  which 
guarantees  that  firms,  by  minimizing  their  costs,  decide  the  optimal  mix  of  domestic 
intermediate  goods (VDFA) and imported  (VIFA) and only then decide on the origin  of the 
imports. 
 
The  external  sector  of  the  economy  (rest  of  the  World)  also  interacts  with  the  private 
household and the government through the purchase of imported goods and services  - VIPA 
and VIGA, respectively. 
 
The  model  also  deals  with  trade  margins  and  the  taxes  or  subsidies  of  domestic  or  foreign 
production. Exports are valued at Free On Board (FOB) and imports at Cost Insurance Freigh 
(CIF) which include insurance or freight  costs, if any. Export (XTAX) and import (MTAX) 
revenues are also directed to the regional household.

In  addition,  the  GTAP  presents  a  global  banking  sector,  which  mediates  global  savings  and 
trade, leaving no gaps between supply and demand for goods (Hertel and Tsigas, 1997). 
 
The  closure  of  the  model,  in  other  words,  the  choice  of  the  endogenous  and  exogenous 
variables  is  the  GTAP  standard,  in  which  the  capital  stock  is  considered  fixed.  The  model 
allows variations of investment in the different regions, however, because it is a static model, 
these investments are not fed back into the economy. 
 
3.3 Empirical Strategy 

 

The  strategy  is  to  simulate  the  growth  of  the  Chinese  economy  through  expanding 
investments in capital (increase of the total capital stock). Chinese's capital stock growth rate, 
at 2011constant prices, was 6% between 1955-1970, 7.5% between 1971-1980, 7.6% between 
1981-1990, 9.5% between 1991-2000 and 11.72% from 2001 to 2014. 
 
Chinese's capital stock growth rate between 1981 and 2014 is 9.6% and the empirical strategy 
is to simulate a 10% (rounded) growth in the China's capital stock by verifying the impacts of 
this  growth  in  production  sector,  exports  and  imports,  and  in  the  welfare  of  selected  LA 
countries and in China itself.

The impacts of Chinese growth on sectorial output in the selected countries of LA, China and 
the rest of the World are presented in Table 1.

decrease  in  production  in  LA  countries  is  higher  in  the  high-tech  sector.  The  only  positive 
changes in industrial production are in the medium-high, medium-low and low-tech sectors of 
Costa Rica and in the low-tech sector in Paraguay. 

 

There  is  also  an  expansion  in  the  production  of  the  services  sector  in  the  countries  under 
analysis.  Production  of  primary  products  also  increased,  with  the  exception  of  Colombia  (-
0.11), Ecuador (-0.01) and Venezuela (-0.04), which varied negatively the production in this 
sector. 
 
In China the expansion in the capital stock led to an enlargement of production in all sectors, 
especially in the industrial sectors linked to high and medium-high complexity technologies. 
 
From Table 2, it's noticeable that LA’s exports varied negatively in the industrial and services 
segments,  given  the  shock  of  Chinese  capital  expansion.  With  the  exception  of  Costa  Rica, 
that increased its exports in the industrial of medium-high, medium-low technology and in the 
services sectors and Mexico, which positively varied its low-technology industrial exports and 
services.

Mexico has diversified its productive structure over the years and Costa Rica is characterized 
by  the  manufacture  of  computers  chips  and  other  electronics,  especially  after  the  country 
started  to  export  to  Lenovo,  HP  and  Dell,  which  maintains  their  assembly  lines  in  China 
(Medeiros  and  Cintra,  2015,  Castillo  and  Neto,  2016).  The  rest  of  the  World  also  increased 
services exports given the increase in China's capital stock. 
 
Primary  good's  sector's  exports,  with  the  exception  of  Colombia  and  Paraguay,  also  varied 
positively, which refers to a process of reprimarization of the exporting parcel of AL.

In  contrast  to  the  LA  countries,  China  has  expanded  its  exports  in  the  industrial  sectors, 
particularly in the high and medium technology sectors. Along with that, Chinese exports of 
primary goods declined. 
 
Table 3 shows the variation  in  imports.  LA in  general  showed an increase in  imports in  the 
industrial segments, especially in the high technology sector. Costa Rica and Mexico showed 
a  fall  in  imports  from  the  industrial  sectors.  A  decrease  in  Latin  American  primary  goods 
imports  can  be  observe,  with  the  exception  of  Brazil,  Peru  and  Mexico  that  augmented 
importation in this segment. 

 

China, on the other hand, experienced  a decline in imports from the high and medium-high 
technology sectors and an expansion in imports from technological lower-intensity industrial 
sectors,  services  and  primary  products,  with  emphasis  to  the  increase  in  imports  from  the 
primary sector (7.15).

The welfare variation is  calculated from the equivalent variation, representing the change in 
wealth that would be equivalent to the change in prices, in terms of its impact on well-being 
(Mas-Collel,  1995).  The  welfare  decomposition  effect  portrays  the  shock's  impacts  on 
economic contributions, measured in monetary units. 

 

According  to  Burfisher  (2011)  the  welfare  decomposition  effect  can  be  divided  into  six 
components:  a)  allocative  efficiency  effect:  showing  the  excess  of  each  tax,  b)  endowment 
effect: due to changes in the quantities of production factor's (eg, the capital) that change the 
productive capacity of an economy, c) technology effect: due to changes in the productivity of 
factors and/or intermediate products which change the effective endowments of an economy 
and  its  productive  capacity,  (d)  effect  on  trade  in  goods  produced  (terms  of  trade):  due  to 
changes  in  the  rest  of  the  world  and  in  the  economy  in  relation  to  prices  of  exported  goods 
and services (fob) and imported goods and services (cif), e) savings-investment effect: due to 
a  change  in  the  price  of  capital  goods  in  relation  to  the  saving  price  in  the  global  bank,  f)

effects change in preferences: due to changes in private consumption, government actions and 
savings in national spending. 

 

With  the  positive  shock  of  10%  in  the  Chinese  capital  stock,  it  is  noticeable  that  the  net 
welfare  variation  was  positive  for  all  countries,  except  for  Costa  Rica.  Countries'  welfare 
variations  are  due  to  the  allocation  effect,  endowment  effect,  terms  of  trade  effect  and 
investment-savings, as shown in Table 4.

It’s visible that only China has had an effect on factor endowments thanks to the increase in 
its capital stock. The welfare decomposition effects point to a positive allocation effect in the 
analyzed regions, with the exception of Peru and Costa Rica. 

 

The effect on terms of trade measures the purchasing power of an economy and is calculated 
using a proportion between exported goods price's and imported goods prince's. Thus, given 
that  China's  increased  industrial  goods'  production  and  an  raised  in  its  demand  for  primary 
products  (commodity  boom),  LA  countries  benefited  from  trade  due  to  improved  terms  of 
trade. The change in  the terms  of trade was negative  for China and Costa Rica which could 
have was a "competitive" outcome with the Chinese production. 
 
The  effect  of  investment-savings  relationship  is  different  between  countries  and  depends  on 
whether the country is a demander or a net supplier of savings. 
 
Overall, the biggest gains in welfare are in China, which received a 10% shock on its capital 
stock.  It  is  also  worth  mentioning  the  welfare  rise  in  Brazil,  which  has  China  as  its    main 
trading partner (Brazil, 2017).

5.   CONCLUSIONS 

 
This paper proposes to empirically observe, through the  CGE model, the impacts of China's 
growth  in  the  selected  LA  countries  and  on  China  itself.  Chinese  growth  was  simulated  by 
expanding  its  occurred  country's  capital  stock  by  10%  such  as  it  has  over  the  past  few 
decades. 
 
Latin American countries are export mostly of primary products to China, as well as products 
of low technological intensities. In contrast, Chinese exports to LA consist of products linked 
to  industrial  segment,  such  as  high-  and  medium-technology  sectors,  in  addition  to  Chinese 
manufactures of low technological intensity and low cost. The impacts of the Chinese growth 
simulation  show  a  declivity  in  the  selected  LA  countries'  industrial  production  and  an 
expansion in the production of primary products and in the service sector of that region. 
 
However,  there  are  exceptions,  such  as  Costa  Rica,  that  escalated  in  production  and 
exportation  of  industrial  sectors,  except  in  the  high  technology  sector,  as  well  as  had  a 
reduction in industrial imports. It’s important to accentuate that Intel's exit from Costa Rica in 
2014 may have had an impact on the country's commercial relationships.  
 
Mexico is also a particular case of the Latin American general rule, with a decline in medium 
and  low  technology  industrial  imports.  The  Mexican  economy  has  been  experiencing  an 
improvement  in  its  exports  in  recent  years.  At  the  same  time  that  it  is  undergoing  for 
competition and commercialization with China, Mexico has more intense trade relations with 
the United States. 
 
Still,  the  general  scenario  in  LA  is  worrisome,  since  in  one  hand  the  partnership  between 
China and LA increased the general well-being of these economies throughout the years 2000, 
with  the  commodities  boom  the  reality  is  an  indication  of  deindustrialization  in  Latin 
American countries with a decrease in the industrial production share and an increase in the 
production in the services and primary goods sectors. 
 
On  the  other  hand,  China  has  been  increased  its  industrial  production  and  technological 
intensity,  and  is  no  longer  just  an  exporting  economy  of  cheap  manufacturing  products,  but 
competing in the high technology segments, including being able to preclude the advance of 
Latin American production in these segments. 
 
So the question is: multual benefits or dependence on trade relations between China and LA? 
LA  is  a  cradle  of  natural  resources,  however,  the  dependence  that  these  countries  face  in 
relation  to  the  production  of  these  resources,  makes  them  vulnerable  in  the  international 
scenario,  that  is,  susceptible  to  booms  and  falls  in  commodity  prices.  Chinese  economic 
growth and the consequent increase in the demand for commodities by this country stands as 
a demonstrative of the degree of specialization in the productive and export  LA agenda and 
its fragility to the competition in industrial segments. 
 
If  Latin  American  countries  want  to  build  a  success  story  in  pursuit  of  their  economic 
development, they need to rethink their trade relations with China, not forgetting to watch for 
their internal deficiencies. Investing in quality human capital, infrastructure, seeking technical 
advance  with  a  planned  industrial  policy  with  all  segments  of  society,  including  the  market 
and the State, are necessary conditions for LA to get out of the bonds of dependence on the 
international stage.
