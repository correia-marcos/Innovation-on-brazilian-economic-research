Resumo

O processo de globalização produtiva, especialmente após a década de 2000, reconﬁgurou a
dinâmica dos ﬂuxos de investimentos internacionais. As ﬁrmas multinacionais tiveram, e ainda
têm, um papel fundamental neste novo cenário internacional. Um ponto interessante, da per-
spectiva microeconômica, é entender o que leva a essas ﬁrmas a expandirem suas operações em
outras economias. Com base no modelo de Yeaple (2009), busca-se avaliar se o nível de produ-
tividade das ﬁrmas multinacionais brasileiras e outras variáveis exógenas impactam as decisões
de investimento estrangeiro direto (IED). Ao utilizar microdados e diferentes modelos empíri-
cos, concluí-se que há, de fato, uma tendência das ﬁrmas brasileiras mais produtivas em estarem
presentes em um maior conjunto de países e, sobretudo, em maior escala. Veriﬁca-se também
que as características-país, tais como Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), PIB per capita e distância
são relevantes, na maioria dos casos, em explicar as decisões de IED das ﬁrmas brasileiras.

Abstract

The process of the globalization of production, especially after the decade of 2000, reconﬁg-
urated the dynamics of foreigns investiments ﬂows. Multinational ﬁrms had, and still have,
a fundamental role in this new international economic scenario. An interesting point, on the
microeconomic perspective,is to understand what it takes these ﬁrms to expand it’s operations
in other economies. Based on the model constructed by Yeaple (2009), we aimed to evaluate
if the level of productivity within the ﬁrms and other exogenous variables impact the decisions
of foreign direct investiment (FDI). Using microdata and diferent empiric models, we con-
cluded that there is, in fact, a tendecy in the most productives brazilian ﬁrms to be present in a
larger set of countries and with higher levels of scales of operations. It is also veriﬁed that the
country-charactheristics, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), GDP per capita and distance
are relevant, in most cases, in explaining the decisions of FDI of brazilian ﬁrms.

Key-words: Productivity, Multinational companies, Brazil.

Introduction

The technological gains achieved since the 1990s have encouraged the economies to
turn to foreign trade in the pursuit of trade gains. The globalization process has mitigated trade
barriers and encouraged investment foreign trade, promoting greater freedom to trade goods
and services between countries. Thus, the role of multinational ﬁrms in this phase of economic
integration has assumed a strong relevance in determining the ﬂows of foreign direct investment
(FDI).

Brazilian FDI outﬂows in the early 1990s, according to Amal e Kegel (2012), was re-
garded as relatively insigniﬁcant. From the late 1990 and early 2000, due to the economic
reforms carried out previously, brazilian ﬁrms moved towards the international markets through
foreign direct investment. This process has accelerated since 2001, driven by a new cycle of
business in the world economy. Since then, brazilian companies has been more actively in-
volved in global value chains through its subsidiaries and has increasingly promoted foreign
investment direct.

Studies carried out by Yeaple (2009) suggest that the most productive ﬁrms promote
foreign direct investment in a larger set of countries and, in general, the revenues obtained
from these investments are greater in relation to the lesser productive ﬁrms. In addition, coun-
tries with a speciﬁc set of characteristics, such as large GDP and GDP per capita, population
size, smaller distances, bilateral or multilateral trade agreements, have a greater number of
subsidiaries of multinational ﬁrms, with a relatively lower level of productivity, compared to
countries with less attractive individual characteristics.

For Brainard (1993) and Yeaple (2009), the direction of the investment ﬂows of multi-
national ﬁrms tends to the markets with more proximity (in terms of distance) and fewer eco-
nomic restrictions to the movement of international investments. Using data for the United
States, evidence was found that more productive ﬁrms have subsidiaries in a larger set of foreign
economies and, in general, have higher revenues. In addition, the results showed the presence of
a pecking order of FDI, i.e., more productive ﬁrms are present in countries with less attractive
characteristics, while, on the other hand, less productive ﬁrms engage in FDI only in attractive
localities.

Therefore, this paper seeks to test if the predictions described by Helpman, Melitz e
Yeaple (2004) and, especially, by Yeaple (2009), ﬁt for the case of brazilian multinational ﬁrms.
The lack of scientiﬁc work that speciﬁcally addresses the outﬂows of Brazilian foreign invest-
ment, taking into account the economic theory developed about multinational ﬁrms, is the main
motivation of this research. Furthermore, the paper has two central goals:
to ﬁnd how the
subsidiaries of Brazilian multinationals are spatially distributed; and what are the determining
factors in the decision of multinational ﬁrms to serve foreign markets and how level of produc-
tivity and the other variables determine this decision paradigm.

The article is divided into 5 sections, in addition to this introduction. The second section

2

deals with the revisions of the theoretical literature and its contributions to the development of
the theory of multinational ﬁrms. The third section deals with the empirical literature developed
in recent years. The fourth section is the methodology of the work, divide in obtaining the
data and the empirical strategies adopted. The results section is divided into 5 sub-sections:
descriptive analysis, scope, scale, country characteristics and cutoff point. The ﬁnal section is
devoted to the ﬁnal considerations.

2 Literature Review

Dunning (1977) reinforces the role of multinationals in investment ﬂows. In the initial
starting point of the traditional theory of multinationals, multinational ﬁrms have a set of spe-
ciﬁc advantages vis-à-vis domestic ﬁrms that justify the establishment of a subsidiary in another
country. Dunning denominates these advantages as OLI.

The ﬁrst advantage concerns about the sub-paradigm of property. Multinationals have,
in most cases, competitive advantages over domestic ﬁrms. These advantages are a result of
the possession of technological assets - such as technology and differentiated products - in a
monopolistic competition structure. The locational advantage consists of the natural and ﬁxed
inputs in a foreign country which, together with the technological superiority, logistics and
administration of multinational ﬁrms, favors foreign investment in these localities. Finally,
internationalization refers to the advantage of which multinationals beneﬁt from the differences
in the prices of factors of production between countries, in order to reduce production costs as
well as to obtain economies of scale.

The eclectic approach of FDI and the role of multinationals encompasses a multitude of
factors from the OLI advantages. Other studies with a more speciﬁc approach on the different
modalities of FDI were carried out during the 1980s. These studies addressed two types of
foreign direct investment: Vertical FDI and horizontal FDI.

Helpman (1984) assesses the decision-making processes of multinational ﬁrms regard-
ing vertical FDI. In his article, Helpman (1984) analyzes the conditions necessary for ﬁrms to
internationalize their production processes through FDI in order to identify the role of multina-
tional companies in the determination of international investment ﬂows. The main contribution
of Helpman (1984) regarding the theory of multinational ﬁrms is the theoretical clariﬁcation of
the determination and movement of international investments. Countries differ in the allocation
of factors of production and multinationals have the capacity to exploit these divergences in the
remuneration of production factors, diversifying its production activities in lower cost areas.

Markusen (1984) departs from Helpman’s approach of FDI. Markusen (1984) proposes
that the decisions of multinational ﬁrms to promote FDI are not based on the relative endowment
of factors, but on the degree of technological instruction of the ﬁrm. In addition, the horizontal
FDI derives from the interactions of companies at the plant level with ﬁrms activities such as
RD, marketing, advertising and distribution.

3

Markusen (1984) develops a model in which multinational (multi-plant) companies can
compete with domestic (single-plant) companies. In many respects, the model presents some
key elements, such as the role of multinationals in the determination of FDI, given technical
superiority, as well as the income gains of the recipient countries, due to the effects on the
intersectoral allocation of economic activity.

2.1 Foreign Direct Investment Theory: the 1990 decade

Several contributions were made about the theory of multinational ﬁrms in the 1990.
While the 1980s theorists considered the divergence between the remuneration of factors of
production as the main driver of FDI, the approach adopted by the authors during the 1990s at-
tached greater importance to technological capabilities and economic incentives in determining
foreign direct investment. One of these authors were Brainard (1993).

Brainard (1993) analyzes the decision-making process of multinational companies fac-
ing two possible choices: on the one hand, maximizing the proximity of the consumer mar-
ket of their products and, on the other hand, concentrating the productive process aiming for
economies of scale.

The traditional approach of the 1980s predicted that the decisions of multinationals are
based on the difference in the allocation of production factors and, therefore, the prices of these
factors between the countries, which would encourage the ﬁrms to promote vertical FDI.

Not taking into account the existence of differences between prices of production factors,
Brainard (1993) states that ﬁrms will be more likely to use resources to open a branch in a
foreign country the higher are the costs related to trade barriers and transportation costs, and
lower are the costs related to barriers to foreign investment and the size of economies of scale
at the industry level at the corporate level in aggregate terms. In short, given that factor prices
do not differ, ﬁrms choose to produce abroad or export by comparing the additional ﬁxed costs
of opening a subsidiary in a foreign country and the variable costs of exporting.

2.2 FDI and heterogeneous ﬁrms

The Helpman, Melitz e Yeaple (2004) model deals with the behavior of multinational
ﬁrms regarding direct foreign investment decisions, in the context of inter-sectoral heterogene-
ity. Initially, the authors work with the conception of horizontal FDI that was highlighted in
Markusen (1984) and the choice of ﬁrms between promote this type of FDI and exclusively
serve to the foreign market via export. The model differentiates inter-sectoral productivity
among domestic ﬁrms, exporters and ﬁrms which promote FDI. In general, the authors’ initial
observations are four:

1. Only the most productive ﬁrms undertake activities abroad;

4

2. Among ﬁrms operating in other economies, only the most productive ﬁrms engage in

foreign direct investment (FDI);

3. Assuming a high intra-ﬁrm heterogeneity, the sales of the ﬁrms that operate under FDI

are substantially higher than those of ﬁrms that carry out exports;

4. Firms with low productivity operate only in the domestic market of their nationality.

A ﬁrm in a country i will, in all cases, serve the domestic market through local pro-
duction. Nevertheless, it may also expand its commercial activities to foreign markets, through
exports or foreign direct investment.

The graph constructed by HMY demonstrates analytically the main proposition of the
authors: the relation between the proﬁt functions and the degree of productivity, and the impact
of this relation in the decision of investment. At ﬁrst, all proﬁt functions are linearly increasing
at the same level of demand, given the same labor productivity. Secondly, the proﬁts of ﬁrms
that opt for FDI are initially lower than the others, given the ﬁxed operating costs. In addition,
the proﬁt function of exporting ﬁrms is less inclined due to transportation costs.

activities once they obtain negative proﬁts. Firms that operate in the interval between (ai j
and (ai j

I )1−ε exclusively serve the domestic market.
At the point of intersection between the proﬁt functions of exporting ﬁrms and ﬁrms that
prioritize FDI, the level of proﬁt is the same for both. However, ﬁrms with productivity higher
than (ai j

I )1−ε have higher proﬁtability than others.

2.3 Empirical Evidence

Brainard (1993) extensively addressed the trade off faced by multinational ﬁrms on one
hand, concentrating productive activities in one location, aiming at economies of scale and, in
the other, the proximity of the consumer public.

Brainard (1993) analyzed activities directed abroad, both on the share of exports and the
share of sales of afﬁliates in the with the purpose of evaluating the idiosyncrasies of recipients of
exports and foreign direct investment by US ﬁrms. Then, she promoted empirical tests related
to the activities of foreign companies in the United States. Similar to the initial estimates, the
purpose of this phase is to quantitatively analyze the characteristics of the US economy in order
to draw conclusions about the determinants of foreign ﬁrms’ decisions to export and carry out
FDI. The results suggested that a higher level of trade barriers and transportation costs would
reduce export incentives while making it more attractive to open an afﬁliate in another country,
as her theory indicates.

Head e Ries (2003) proposed an adaptation of the HMY model in the case of ﬁrms of the
Japanese manufacturing sector with the objective of evidencing the parity between predictions
of the HMY model and the model alternative. The HMY model suggests a positive correlation
between the degree of dispersion of productivity among ﬁrms in a sector and the relative sales of
ﬁrms that promote FDI in relation to exporting ﬁrms in foreign markets.Nevertheless, the degree
of productivity determines the level of operation of a ﬁrm, such that only the most productive
ﬁrms serve the foreign markets by direct investment.

However, Head e Ries (2003) have shown that there are several ways of estimating
productivity and, therefore, the relationship between export decisions and direct investment is
subject to the parameter used to quantify the productivity.

In addition, the empirical model of Head e Ries (2003) showed that the heterogeneity in
the ﬁrm’s productivity seems to interact with the heterogeneity in market size and factor prices
of potential recipient countries. Finally, the relationship between ﬁrm size and the market in
which it operates is similar to that predicted by the HMY model.

Yeaple (2009) took a different approach to the HMY model. In dealing with US ﬁrms,
Yeaple (2009) divided the analysis in scope (number of a ﬁrm’s subsidiaries in a foreign market),
and scale (size in terms of sales of the afﬁliates of the ﬁrms). One of the main predictions re-
sulting from Yeaple’s contribution (2009) is: as the productivity of the multinational increases,
the same happens with the scope and scale of operations of their afﬁliates, that is, more produc-
tive ﬁrms have subsidiaries in more countries, and obtain higher revenues from the sale of their
products.

Futhermore, Yeaple (2009) considers the effect of individual characteristics of coun-
tries in determining the range that makes foreign direct investment relatively more proﬁtable
than export. Thus, more attractive countries receive direct investment from ﬁrms that are both
productive and less productive, whereas only ﬁrms with high levels of productivity supplies

6

countries considered to be less attractive.

As the empirical results of Yeaple (2009) suggest, for US ﬁrms, there is a pecking order
in relation to the level of productivity of ﬁrms and the scale of operations of their afﬁliates. The
results of the tests also point out that economies with larger GDP?s, higher GDP per capita and
closer to the United States tend to reduce the average productivity of the incoming afﬁliates of
US ﬁrms.

Fariñas, Martín-Marcos e Velázquez (2018) analyze the HMY model, allied with the
Yeaple model (2009), in the case of the multinational activities of the European ﬁrms. The au-
thors seeked to demonstrate the existence of a relationship between the degree of productivity of
European ﬁrms and the decisions of expansion in foreign markets by FDI or exported activities,
(given by the cut-off point shown in Figure 1, presented in section 1.2) and also to analyse the
order of chain of ﬁrms in relation to the scale and scope of multinational activities, given the
level of productivity and the individual characteristics of the countries

Unlike Helpman, Melitz e Yeaple (2004) and Yeaple (2009), who used only the United
States as a reference country in their research, Fariñas, Martín-Marcos e Velázquez (2018)
proposed an analysis with several european countries, controlling the heterogeneity from the
variability of the data. Another contribution of the authors was the distinction between own-
ership - ownership of the majority subsidiaries -, and control - direct control of afﬁliates - of
multinational ﬁrms.

3 Empirical Strategy

3.1 Methodology

3.1.1 Scope and Scale

The empirical strategy is used to measure the scope and scale of brazillian multinational
activity. Statistical methods of linear regression and linear probability models were used to
promote the estimations. Most of the equation used in this empirical strategy were derived from
Yeaple (2009) and Fariñas, Martín-Marcos e Velázquez (2018).

To examine the relation between scope of operations and productivity, controled by

sector and country, Yeaple (2009) used:

DNh j j = β0 + β1 ∗ lnPNh jh + θp + θs + ε j

(1)

Onde:
DNh j j : Binary variable. If the multinational ﬁrm from country h is present in country j, it
equals 1. Else, it equals 0;
lnPNh jh : the natural log of domestic ﬁrms revenue. It is a proxy for productivity; θp : country
j ﬁxed effects ;

7

θs : sectorial ﬁxed effects.
ε j is the regression error.

The estimation of the scale of operations by the multinational ﬁrms is given by the

TOBIT model. The equation that describes the model is:

SNh j j = β0 + β1 ∗ PNh j j + θp + θs + ε j

(2)

Onde:
SNh j j : afﬁalite sales in a country j by ﬁrm from country h which have an afﬁliate in country j;
PNh j j : domestic ﬁrm revenues;
θp : the country ﬁxed effects for country j ;
θs : sectorial ﬁxed effects for country j.
ε j is the regression error.

For McDonald e Mofﬁtt (1980), the use of the TOBIT model is generally adequate to
model data with the presence of corner solutions, that is, a frequency distribution with right
asymmetry and a large number of observations with null value. In this context, the traditional
method of Least Squares becomes inadequate given the regression bias to negative values.

3.1.2 Country characteristics

Next, it is estimated if the individual characteristics of the countries are decisive factors
for the decision making of the multinational ﬁrm, when choosing between entering foreign
markets via export or FDI. In this context, countries with individual characteristics considered
attractive to multinational companies would reduce the gap where export proﬁtability is higher
than FDI proﬁtability, encouraging the latter. Thus, the empirical strategy is based on the use of
the Ordinary Least Squares model for three different equations.

The ﬁrst equation consists in the estimation of the number of branches, as a dependent
variable, by the set of variables related to the characteristics of the countries. In this case, the
aim is to evaluate if the characteristics of the countries impact the FDI decisions of ﬁrms in
expanding their multinational activities through new afﬁliates.

Ni = β0 + β1 ∗ GDP + β2 ∗ GDPpc + β3 ∗ DIST + β4∗ RTA + εi

(3)

Onde:
Ni is the number of afﬁliates in country i;
εi is the regression error.

The second equation associates the revenues of the subsidiaries with the country char-

8

acteristics, as follows:

SNi = β0 + β1 ∗ GDP + β2 ∗ GDPpc + β3 ∗ DIST + β4 ∗ RTA + εi

(4)

Onde:
SNi is the afﬁliate revenue in country i;
εi is the regression error.

Finally, the third equation deals with the average productivity of multinationals with
country characteristics, that is, the logarithm of domestic revenue of ﬁrms that have a subsidiary
in the same set of country characteristics, divided by the number of subsidiaries that they have
in a country i. The equation is given by:

(lnPN j

i /Ni) = β0 + β1 ∗ GDP + β2 ∗ GDPpc + β3 ∗ DIST + β4 ∗ RTA + εi

(5)

Onde:
PN j

i is the average productivity of ﬁrm j in country i. εi is the regression error.

3.1.3 Cut-off point

According to Yeaple (2009), the cut-off point of multinational activity (PN) is the point
in which FDI proﬁtability exceeds the proﬁtability of other foreign trade activities 1. It repre-
sents the lowest level of productivity in which a multinational ﬁrm promotes FDI in a foreign
economy. The estimation seeks to verify if the characteristics of the countries reduce or enlarge
this cut-off point. Thus, the equation deﬁned by:

lnPNi = β0 + β1 ∗ GDP + β2 ∗ GDPpc + β3 ∗ DIST + β4 ∗ RTA + εi

(6)

Onde:
lnPNi is the logarithm of domestic revenue of ﬁrm i;
εi is the regression error.

3.2 Data

The present work is based on the collection of data from a sample of 112 Brazilian
multinationals with the purpose of analyzing and, above all, evidencing the decisions of ﬁrms
to practice foreign direct investment, given their sectoral characteristics, their productivity levels

and, and ﬁnally, the relations with the macroeconomic variables of the countries whose ﬁrms
have commercial activity.

In this way, it is conﬁgured in a quantitative research. It should be emphasized that the
analysis proposed by this work only covers the year 2016, due to the restriction of information
regarding previous years. Finally, the data obtained are in cross-section format.

4 Results

4.1 Descriptive Analysis

The organizational structure of Brazilian multinational ﬁrms and their subsidiaries, ac-
cording to the various theoretical arguments made in the course of this research, should follow
a pecking order, of which, more productive ﬁrms, that is, with a larger number of domestic
sales, serve a greater number of external markets and, in addition, have a higher average value
of revenue in these markets. On the other hand, ﬁrms with low productivity enter less countries
and the average value of their revenues is lower.

Graph 2 shows the distribution of Brazilian branches in foreign economies. Of the 61
multinational ﬁrms, 74% have only one branch in an overseas market, while only 2% have more
than 6 afﬁliates. We can see here a high concentration of ﬁrms with only one subsidiary, indi-
cating that, on average, these ﬁrms have lower productivity than the others and, consequently,
have lower revenues.

Graph 3 shows the composition of the Brazilian afﬁliates in the countries analyzed.
From the 61 Brazilian ﬁrms, 31 are located in Argentina and 15 are located in Mexico. Thus,
75% of the Brazilian multinational companies are concentrated in these two countries. This
implies that these a set of characteristics - economic, social and political - that make them more
favorable to the entry of the Brazilian subsidiaries

Figure 3: Geographic Distribution of brazilian afﬁliates

It should be noted that given the individual characteristics of the countries - such as dis-
tance, GDP of the recipient country, GDP per capita of the receiving country, size of population

11

and level of country productivity - those with higher productivity levels are more likely of hav-
ing fewer Brazilian branches in their economies, while countries with low levels of productivity
are more likely to have a greater presence of these.

Graph 4 shows the number of Brazilian branches by sector. The Chemical and Food
sectors are distinguished from the others, presenting, in that order, 16 branches each. Next, we
highlight the Metals sector, which has 15 branches. In total, three sectors jointly represent 41%
of the multinational activity of Brazilian ﬁrms.

In addition, ﬁgure 5 shows the number of countries in which the Brazilian branches
of a certain sector are inserted. It is noted that the food industry branches are the most dis-
persed internationally, distributing in 11 countries, while the branches of the lumber sector are
concentrated in only 2 different countries.

The sectorial distribution of the Brazilian subsidiaries is a fundamental aspect of the
analysis of inter-sectoral heterogeneity, especially with respect to the level of productivity of
a given industry and the extension of the multinational activity of the Brazilian subsidiaries,
within a speciﬁc sector, in foreign economies.

Graph 6 lists the aggregate domestic revenues of Brazilian ﬁrms by country group (5
countries per group), ranked in ascending order by number of subsidiaries present. Group 1, for
example, has the smallest number of subsidiaries in a given country, while group 5 presents a
group of countries with a greater presence of subsidiaries.

The behavior of the revenue logarithm is in a chaining order with a moderate growth
trend. However, this order is only partially obeyed. In this case, the assumption that the most
productive ﬁrms - higher levels of domestic revenue - invest in a larger set of countries, regard-
less of the individual characteristics of these ﬁrms fairly adjust for the brazilian case.

12

Figure 6: Logarithm of the aggregate domestic revenue by country group

Graph 1, presented in section 2.2, is based on the assumption that ﬁrms differ in produc-
tivity in such a way that more productive ﬁrms opt for foreign direct investment from a certain
cut-off point, as they obtain larger proﬁts through sales revenues of its subsidiaries, while ﬁrms
with lower levels of productivity access foreign markets via export.

Thus, countries with individual characteristics that reduce the level of productivity re-
quired to become direct investment at least as proﬁtable as exports will have a greater presence
of multinationals. This hypothesis about the effect of the country characteristics on the cut-off
point of the level of proﬁtability and, consequently, on the investment decision of the multina-
tional ﬁrms will be tested empirically.

Next, econometric tests will be carried out to estimate the relationship between the de-
gree of productivity of Brazilian ﬁrms and the scope and scale of the ﬁrms operations in foreign
markets.

4.2 Scope

Table 1 shows the results of the estimation of the scope of multinational activity of
Brazilian ﬁrms in relation to productivity. In the ﬁrst column, the linear probability model was
used to estimate the scope in relation to the level of productivity of the ﬁrm, controlling the
ﬁxed effects country and sector.

Thus, the ﬁrm’s participation in a given market is determined by its productivity, whose
dependent variable is binary: 1 if it participates and 0 otherwise. In the second column, the
PROBIT model is applied in order to verify the robustness of the model treated in column 1.

The results in column 1 are statistically signiﬁcant and positive. They suggest that the
greater the domestic proceeds of Brazilian ﬁrms, proxy for productivity, the more likely these
companies to open a subsidiary in a foreign market.

Column 2 presents the result of the estimation of the same equation proposed for col-
umn 1, but in this case, using the PROBIT model. In this conﬁguration, the result suggests
that, controlled country and sector ﬁxed effects, there is statistical signiﬁcance and positive re-
lation between domestic revenue and afﬁliated sales, corroborating with the results found in the
column 1.

4.3 Scale

Table 2 shows the scale of the multinational activity of Brazilian ﬁrms. Columns 1 and
2 include the results of the estimations of equation 2 by the OLS model. In column 1, the sector
ﬁxed effects were inserted in order to test the speciﬁcation bias that this variable could cause
in the regression. Column 2, on the other hand, does not include sector ﬁxed effects. This
procedure has the purpose of evidencing the robustness of the independent variable, similar to
the PROBIT model in the estimation of the scope of the Brazilian ﬁrms. Column 3 presents the
result of the estimation of the scale of the Brazilian ﬁrms on the productivity proxy, using the
TOBIT model.

The results of column 3 indicate that the estimated values are statistically signiﬁcant
and positive. In the speciﬁcation of the model, there is a positive relationship between domestic
revenue and revenues of the subsidiaries of Brazilian multinational ﬁrms. Thus, the greater
the productivity of multinational ﬁrms - resulting in higher domestic revenues - the higher the
revenues of these ﬁrms’ branches from commercial activities in a given economy.

4.4 Country Characteristics

Table 3 presents the results referring to the estimated values parameters of the regressors
estimates that associate the characteristics of the countries in relation to the variables of the
Brazilian multinational ﬁrms.

Given the restriction of the number of observations of the country characteristics (limited
to the number of countries analyzed), it was decided to disaggregate the data in the country-
industry sample format. This approach allows, on the one hand, to indirectly control intra-
sectoral heterogeneity and, on the other hand, to extend the sample so that it is possible to
produce a statistically signiﬁcant linear regression model.

It should be noted that industrial dummy variables were included in the models presented

Column 1 shows the results of the estimation of the number of subsidiaries by country-
industry in relation to the characteristic variables of the countries. The estimated coefﬁcients
of the disaggregated sample for column 1 have the predicted signal.
In this case, countries
with larger markets (higher GDP), richer in terms of per capita (higher GDP per capita) and less
distant (less DIST) have a higher number of Brazilian subsidiaries. All variables are statistically
signiﬁcant at the signiﬁcance level of 10%, but only GDP and DIST are statistically signiﬁcant
at the signiﬁcance level of 5%. The binary variable representing the existence of commercial
agreements (RTA) was statistically insigniﬁcant.

In the speciﬁcation of the linear regression model for afﬁliated sales, shown in column
2, only the per capita GDP coefﬁcient is non-signiﬁcant. Estimates for GDP and DIST have
the predicted signal and are statistically signiﬁcant, indicating that a 1% increase in GDP re-
sults in a 1.71% increase in revenue from afﬁliated sales of Brazilian subsidiaries, while a 1%
increase in distance (DIST) reduces the revenues of subsidiaries by 4.52%. Nevertheless, the
RTA coefﬁcient, although statistically signiﬁcant, did not obtain the predicted signal.

Column 3 presents the coefﬁcients of the regression of the average productivity in rela-
tion to the country characteristics. In this context, the average productivity is the ratio between
the domestic revenue of Brazilian ﬁrms - proxy for productivity - and the number of subsidies,
in the sample disaggregated by country-industry.

All variables except RTA are statistically signiﬁcant. However, only the sign of GDP
per capita is similar to that predicted, that is, contrary to the sign of the coefﬁcient of the
variables of column 1. The results indicate that the average productivity of ﬁrms is increasing
for GDP and decreasing for GDPpc and DIST. Thus, countries with higher GDP, lower GDP per
capita (China, for example) and closer to Brazil receive brazilian subsidiaries with increasing

16

productivity, in average.

4.5 Cut-Off Point

The purpose of this section is to test whether country characteristics determine the cut-
off level of multinational activity. The cut-off point, in the context of ﬁrms that participate in
the international market, is the point at which FDI proﬁtability outperforms export proﬁtability.
Thus, only the most productive ﬁrms would be able to go beyond this point and engage in
foreign direct investment. However, Yeaple (2009) states that the characteristics of the countries
would induce a reduction or increase of the cut-off point, such that more productive ﬁrms would
perform FDI independently of the country characteristics, while less productive ﬁrms would
only promote FDI in the most attractive locations.

The results of the estimation of the cut-off variable with the country characteristics are
shown in Table 4. According to Yeaple (2009), the cut-off variable, representative of the cut-
off point, is the value minimum of the logarithm of the domestic revenues of a Brazilian ﬁrm
that has a subsidiary in a given country-industry. In this way, it represents the lowest level of
productivity required to promote FDI in a sector of a foreign economy.

The results obtained for the coefﬁcients are statistically signiﬁcant at the signiﬁcance
level of 10 %, except the RTA. The signs of the coefﬁcients are similar to those in column
3 of table 3. Following the results, the productivity cutoff point is higher in countries with
larger markets (GDP), with lower per capita income (GDPPC) and greater distance from Brazil
(DIST).

5 Conclusion

This paper aimed to demonstrate the relationship between the heterogeneity of produc-
tivity levels and the decisions of multinational ﬁrms to participate in the international market
through FDI with a greater or lesser degree of intensity. In a broader context, the aim was to
evaluate if the characteristics of the countries affect the minimum level of productivity to per-
form FDI in a certain sector of a foreign economy, with positive proﬁts and higher than the
export alternative. For this, the models of Helpman, Melitz e Yeaple (2004) and Yeaple (2009)
were used as theoretical and empirical basis for the case of Brazilian ﬁrms.

It was analyzed whether the Brazilian multinationals met the pecking-order hypothesis,
from which more productive ﬁrms engage in higher FDI levels in locations considered less at-
tractive to foreign investment than the others, less productive. In this sense, it was evidenced
that more productive companies participate more actively, through a greater presence of sub-
sidiaries, for a certain set of countries. However, it should be noted that the strong presence
of zeros in the data regarding the domestic revenues of the ﬁrms implies that the productiviy
pecking-order found is not a sufﬁcient condition to evaluate the foreign investment ﬂows of
Brazilian ﬁrms. That is, the economic signiﬁcance of zero-value revenues may not have been
captured by group aggregation, thus requiring an additional method to assess the robustness of
results.

To verify the effect of productivity on the scope and scale of the multinational activity
of Brazilian ﬁrms, the PROBIT and TOBIT models were used on the number of subsidiaries
and afﬁliated sales of the Brazilian multinationals, respectively. The results presented suggested
a positive relationship between productivity and number of subsidiaries, and productivity and
afﬁliated sales, thus providing a favorable argument for the pecking-order of multinational com-
panies.

The results found in this study met, for the most part, the objectives proposed initially.
However, it is worth mentioning that there is an informational problem about data on Brazil-
ian FDI. As Calderón (2014) pointed out, it became difﬁcult to identify the ﬁnal sectors and
recipient countries of FDI of Brazilian ﬁrms.

New research carried out in this ﬁeld should take into account the fact that more robust
techniques for the treatment of the strong presence of zeros and the concentration of the data
are employed in order to generate even more precise results.
