Resumo: Este artigo apresenta a estrutura e os resultados de um modelo computacional baseado 
em vários agentes heterogêneos que mede os efeitos das mudanças nas taxas de juros básica e 
esperada  sobre  a  série  do  valor  intrínseco  da  carteira  teórica  do  Ibovespa.    Isto  possibilita 
insights  originais  sobre  o  mecanismo  de  transmissão  da  política  monetária  sobre  o  valor 
intrínseco  da  carteira  teórica  do  Ibovespa  no  período  de  2008/2010.  Os  resultados  do  modelo 
quantificam bolhas no mercado de  capitais (bullmarket) e também situações de  bearmarket. O 
modelo também estima uma série semanal de hiato de valor para o Ibovespa. O hiato de valor 
(GV) é um novo índice de value investing proposto pelos autores. Duas conclusões do modelo: 
(i)  o  mecanismo  de  transmissão  da  política  de  juros  do  Copom  afetará  o  GV  do  Ibovespa 
negativamente  somente  quando  as  companhias  que  fazem  parte  deste  índice,  apresentarem 
geração agregada líquida de caixa negativa; e (ii) as decisões do COPOM de aumentar (diminuir) 
a taxa Selic resultarão em aumentos (reduções) no GV do Ibovespa. 
Palavras-chave: economia computacional baseada no agente, índice de hiato de valor, mercado

Abstract: This article presents the structure and the results of a computational model based on 
several heterogeneous agents that measures the effects of changing basic and expected interest 
rates on the series of the intrinsic value of Ibovespa`s (Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index) 
theoretical portfolio. This may give original insights on the effects of the transmission 
mechanism of monetary policy on this series in the period of 2008/2010.  The model results 
quantify both bull market and bear market. The model also estimates a weekly time series of gap 
values of the Ibovespa. Gap value (GV) is a new index of value investing proposed by the 
authors. Two conclusions of the model are: (i) COPOM’s decisions to increase (reduce) the 
benchmark interest rate will invariably result in increased (reduced) Ibovespa`s GV; and (ii) the 
transmission  mechanism of monetary policy will affect Ibovespa`s GV negatively only when 
the companies that make up this index have, aggregated negative net cash generation3. 
Keywords: agent-based computational economics (ABCE), gap value index, stock market and 
monetary policy transmission mechanism.

1. Introduction 

This  paper  introduces  a  computer-based,  multi-agent  financial  model  (henceforth, 
“computational  model”  or  “model”)  that  uses  stock  valuation  techniques  and  computer 
simulation to estimate two time series: one with intrinsic values for Bovespa (Sao Paulo Stock 
Exchange) Index Theoretical Portfolio  and another with a proposal of a index of value investing, 
named Ibovespa`s gap value.

Section 2 describes the computer-based model and its five modules. It also introduces the 
notion of “gap  value”4, GV, which intends to be an index to detect and measure financial market 
bubbles and circumstances under which Ibovespa (Bovespa Index) market value is higher than 
its  intrinsic  value  (bull  market)  or  the  other  way  round  (bear  market).  Section  3  presents  the 
corollaries of the model. Section 4 reports the results of a graph analysis of Ibovespa series of 
intrinsic  value  elasticity  and  GV  elasticity  compared  to  a  series  of  benchmark  and  expected 
interest  rates.  It  particularly  highlights  the  events  that  have  influenced  the  series  behavior. 
Section 5 provides final remarks. 

 

2.  Model Development 

The model includes four modules as described in the following subsections.  

 

2.1. Module 1 – Ibovespa companies’ cash flow 

The model, developed using the software packages Mathematica 75 and Excel 2007,builds 
on  the  discounted  cash  flow  technique  (DCF).  According  to  Damodaran  (2012),  leveraged 
companies are best assessed on the basis of their free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)6. FCFF is 
derived from EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). Table 1 shows how this process occurs, 
including their meaning and data source. The cash flows included in the model were extracted 
from 816 accounting statements7 from 2008 through 2010.The cash flows for the two subsequent 
years (the 2011-2012 biennium) were estimated using the least squares method8.

4In the rest of text, this term wil be called  GV. 
5The  use  of  this  software  relies  on  its  power  to  work  with  symbolic  mathematics  (or  literal  algebra).Calculations 
using  symbolic  mathematics  are  common  in  models  of  macro  and  microeconomics  as  well  as  in  computer-based 
models.  
6Leveraged companies are those companies that use debt to finance their operations. They are not necessarily very 
debt-laden companies, but companies with any given burden of debt ( Damodaran 2002  and Bisciari, Durré & 
Nyssen 2003). 
7These  data  are  the  standardized  financial  statements  available  from  the  Brazilian  Stock  Market  Regulatory 
Comission (Comissão de Valores Mobiliários/CVM) website. 
8Excel 2007 was used to calculate the cash flows, and function PROJ.LIN was used to calculate the least squares.

2.2. Module 2 – Inter-temporal discounting model 

This model includes the time horizon of the cash flow projections to be discounted. Before 
projecting a company’s cash flow, it is important to decide how many periods or stages will be 
included for cash flow in perpetuity. In accordance with Cuberthson & Nitzsche (2004: 21) and 
Stewart III (1991: 97), a number of stages can be identified in a business growth to maturity9, 
depending on the characteristics of each company. As one of the goals of the model is to build a 
series of weekly intrinsic values for the companies making up the Bovespa Index, they will be 
assumed  to  have  two  stages  for  the  sake  of  simplicity.  In  this  assumption,  the  first  stage 
corresponds to the short term, while the second stage refers to an infinite time horizon (i.e., in 
perpetuity)10. The formula for the first stage11 is: 

=

Where: IVA stands for the intrinsic value in the first stage, FCFF1 is the cash flow in the present 
period,  and  it  refers  to  the  benchmark/base  interest  rate  as  determined  by  COPOM  (Monetary 
Policy Committee, Central Bank of Brazil). All these variables are calculated on a weekly basis. 
The  intrinsic  value  in  stage  1  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  results  of  a  simple  discount  formula  in  a 
given period, where the basic interest rate i 12 substitutes every company’s weighted average cost 
of  capital  (WACC),  a  variable  commonly  adopted  in  finance  and  valuation  techniques13.  The 
second  stage  assumes  that  the  net  cash  flow  result  is  in  perpetuity14.  The  inter-temporal 
discounting formula in the second stage is as follows:

Where: IVB stands for the intrinsic value in the second stage, FCFF3 refers to the free cash flow 
to the firm in the third period (t+2), ie is the expected basic interest rate, g2 corresponds to the 
growth rate in the second stage. All these variables are calculated on a weekly basis. As shown, 
discounting formula (2) includes an expected growth rate (g2) and an expected interest rate (ie)15. 
Rate g2 is a geometric mean including the per share profit variation in period 2001-2010 plus an 
investors’ confidence component (Y
 ) stands for the stockholders' 
willingness to invest. This variable corresponds to an adjusted average rate of return on equity in 
the 1996-2010 period and a rate of variation obtained from the exam of  the technical analysis 
                                                            
9Growth to maturity: period of transition and adjustment of a company's return and risk. 
10According  to  Bodie,  Kane  &  Marcus  (2003)  and  Damodaran  (2011),  two-stage  valuation  models  adopt  the 
simplifying hypothesis that the companies will not experience any extraordinary changes in the upcoming years, yet 
they  will experience some changes to their capital  structure, and growth and productivity patterns. Therefore, the 
ideal is to project an adjustment period (the first stage).The dividend policy will not be definitive before the second 
stage, which includes the perpetuity. The first stage is expected to have a distinct level of growth with higher levels 
of net investments, both in tangible assets and working capital. 
11For a discussion of this formula, see Damodaran (2011: 301), McKinsey & Co. (2000: 76) and  Stickney, Weil & 
Schipper (2009: 143). 
12It corresponds to the basic Selic interest rate as defined by the Monetary Policy Committee. Selic is the acronym of 
Custody and Settlement Special System (Sistema Especial de Liquidação e Custódia).  
13The underlying hypothesis is that the companies making up t the Ibovespa theoretical portfolio have the Selic rate 
as  a  proxy  of  capital  cost.  This  is  a  useful  simplifying  hypothesis,  as  it  allows  for  aggregating  all  Ibovespa 
companies  without performing individual accounting calculations, which would be laborious and make the model 
unfeasible. This hypothesis is realistic, as most companies making up the Ibovespa borrow funds from BNDES1 at 
lower rates than the COPOM-defined Selic rate. Therefore, the major Ibovespa companies' WACC is assumed not to 
be distant from ib. 
14 The second stage is the period in which the investment will yield returns at percentages quite close to that of the 
minimum return rate demanded by the capital providers (creditors and stockholders). 
15 The source for the expected Selic rate (ie) is the Focus Report, which is published by the Central Bank of Brazil on 
a weekly basis.

trend graphics16. Each variable has a weighting of 0.5. It was also used to calibrate the model for 
the weekly  changes in the investors' confidence  about the company's stocks. The  animal spirit     
( Y
 ) is incorporated into the g2 calculation. By including inter-temporal discounting rates (ib  and 
ie),  the  model  integrates  the  financial  data  provided  by  the  cash  flows,  a  variable  of  monetary 
policy  (the  Selic  rate  defined  by  COPOM),  and  the  decision  rules  guiding  the  behavior  of  a 
representative agent. Indeed, this computer-based financial model is also multi-agent-based, and 
both  inter-temporal  discounting  rates  can  be  understood  as  minimum  attractive  rates  for  the 
multiple agents making up in the model. 
 
2.3. Module 3 – IV and GV in Ibovespa theoretical portfolio 

This  module  targets  the  IV  and  GV  of  both  companies  and  the  Ibovespa  theoretical 
portfolio. In general terms, the module is composed of the sum of intrinsic values in both stages. 
The weekly intrinsic value of a company is, therefore17:

Following  the  model  methodology,  68  intrinsic  values  are  generated  (building  on  the 

discounted cash flows).18 

The concept of GV, as introduced in this paper, is aimed as an index that predicts financial 
market bubbles as well as bull market and bear market conditions. The GV is determined using a 
weekly time series that comprises the difference between intrinsic values (as shown in Module 2) 
and market values (number of shares x share price on the cash market) that make up the Ibovespa 
theoretical portfolio. Equation (5) is a matrix equation that calculates the GV:

Where: GV(68x156) is the gap value, MV(68x156) is the market value of the 68 shares in the Ibovespa 
theoretical portfolio, and IV(68x156) is the intrinsic value. All these variables are calculated for 1 
week, as represented in the vector columns. 

The results are placed in a matrix, where the rows represent the weeks and the columns 
represent the weekly intrinsic values. Subtracting values of every row vector gives the GV. The

Stressing the result of the GV matrix and using an alternative notation gives:

17General formula based on Damodaran (2012). 
18The model generates, therefore, 68 weekly time series of intrinsic values of the shares making up the Ibovespa`s 
theoretical portfolio. These weekly series include 52 observations each. The results are placed in a matrix, where the 
rows represent the weeks and the columns represent the weekly intrinsic values. Summing up the values in each row 
vector  gives  the  weekly  intrinsic  value  of  the  Ibovespa´s  theoretical  portfolio.  It  will  become  clearer  in  the 
description of the following module of the model.

2.4. Module 4 – gap value elasticity in relation to benchmark and expected interest rates 

 GV elasticities are deduced from equations (8) using software package Mathematica 719 as 

follows. 

Differentiating (8) in relation to ib, which is a weekly benchmark interest rate20, gives the 
matrix equation (12), which shows the several elasticity values of the intrinsic values of every 
share  in  the  Ibovespa  theoretical  portfolio  in  relation  to  COPOM’s  benchmark  interest  rate. 
Elasticity (12) herein determines the effect of, for instance,  an 1-percentage-point variation on 
the intrinsic value of a share in the Bovespa Index.

Partitioning  matrix  (12)  gives  the  row  values  that  represent  the  elasticity  curve  of  all 
Ibovespa`s  stocks  in  relation  to  the  several  levels  of  interest  rates  determined  by  COPOM 
throughout  156  weeks  (in  the  2008-2010  triennium).Summing  up  these  row  vectors  gives  the 
series of Ibovespa`s GV elasticity in relation to the Selic rate, the first objective of this paper.

After  that,  matrix  (8)  is  differentiated  in  relation  to  the  expected  interest  rate.  The 
calculations, similar to those provided before, give the series of GV for every Ibovespa`s stock in 
relation  to  the  expected  interest  rate,  as  well  as  the  series  of  GV  of  the  Ibovespa`s  theoretical 
portfolio  as  a  whole  in  relation  to  this  very  variable  (expected  interest  rate).  Therefore,  result 
(14) below attains the second objective of this paper.

Partitioning matrix (12) gives the row values that represent the elasticity curve of all Ibovespa 
stocks in relation to the several levels of interest rates determined by COPOM thought 156 weeks 
(in the 2008-2010 triennium). Now let each expression contained in the matrix (14) cells be
wGV , 
where s stands for the number of stocks in the Ibovespa`s theoretical portfolio (listed in alphabetical 
order),  and  w  stands  for  the  week  to  which  a  given  share’s  market  value  and  intrinsic  value

3.  Corollaries of the model 

The  GV  results,  particularly  from  equation  (5)  onwards,  fall  in  three  categories: 

downside, upside, and balance (IV and MV are equal). These categories are shown in Table 2.  

As Table 2 shows, the GV elasticity in relation to the benchmark interest rate (Selic rate 

defined by COPOM) is negative only in B; it is positive in all other conditions.  

This  means  that  the  transmission  mechanism  of  monetary  policy  will  affect  Ibovespa`s 
GV negatively only when the companies that make up this index have, altogether, negative net 
cash generation.  

Otherwise,  coeteris  paribus,  COPOM’s  decisions  to  increase  (reduce)  the  benchmark 

interest rate will invariably result in increased (reduced) Ibovespa`s GV.

4.  Results of the model simulations: graph analysis of years 2008 through 2010 

This  section  provides  the  results  of  the  macroeconomic,  computer-based,  agent-based 
financial model for the 2008-2010 triennium21. Each subsection analyses the events of each year 
of  the  triennium  that  influenced  the  elasticity  curve  of  Ibovespa`s  IV  and  GV  in  relation  to 
changes to the benchmark and expected interest rates. The simulations were carried out on Excel 

                                                            
21The events related to the monetary policy and the financial market evolution in the triennium under scrutiny are 
based on the Central Bank of Brazil’s annual reports and on several editions of the ConjunturaEconômicamagazine 
and the Valor Econômico newspaper.

2007  by  calibrating  the  growth  rate  parameters  (g2)  in  vector  (11)  equations.  This  series  is 
calculated on a weekly basis, and refers to the 156 weeks in the triennium.22 

All the following subsections provide graph analysis for the computer-based simulations. 
The  subsections  are  divided  according  to  the  year  to  which  they  refer.  The  weekly  series 
correspond  to  the  following  row  vectors:  (1)  IV  –  intrinsic  value  vector  for  the  Ibovespa`s  
theoretical  portfolio,  which  is  the  sum  of  the  52  weekly  time  series  of  the  intrinsic  values 
estimated  by  the  computer-based  model  for  the  68  stocks  in  the  Ibovespa`s  theoretical 
portfolio23;  (2)  MV  –  market  value  vector  for  the  Ibovespa`s  theoretical  portfolio24;  (3)  Selic 
defined  by  COPOM    short-term  interest  rate,  represented  as  effective  interest  rates  that  were 
weekly compounded; and (4) Expected interest rate – containing expected values as published by 
the  Central  Bank  of  Brazil  in  the  Focus  Report  for  the  respective  weeks  of  the  period  under 
scrutiny. 
 
 
4.1. Effect of the interest rates (benchmark and expected) on the Ibovespa`s IV and GV in  
2008 

The  increased  expected  inflation  (referred  to  by  the  Central  Bank  of  Brazil  as  a  "benign 
scenario"  deriving  from  excess  of  aggregate  demand  over  supply)  led  COPOM  to  interrupt  in 
April  2008  the  policy  of  progressively  mild  interest  rates  that  started  in  September  2005.As  a 
result, the benchmark interest rate goal, which was 11.25% since September 2007, increased 50 
basis  points  (bps)  in  April  2008,  and  suffered  other  increases  upon  three  other  COPOM 
meetings.  It  eventually  reached  13.75%  p.a.  in  December  2008.The  ex-ante  real  interest  rate, 
calculated by the Central Bank of Brazil for a period of one year after surveying analysts in the 
private sector,25 increased throughout the first nine months of 2008.In October, the expectations 
for the benchmark interest rates had reduction tendency, which led to a rate of 7.2% p.a. by the 
end of the year (0.7 percentage points higher than that registered for the same month in 2007). 
COPOM’s  contractionary  monetary  policy  measures  in  the  beginning  of  2008  continued  the 
decisions  of  previous  meetings  in  2007,  in  which  the  committee  members  assessed  that  the 
international economic conjuncture and the expanding domestic economic activity required some 
prudential measures from the monetary policy maker. The Committee eventually decided to keep 
the  Selic  rate  at  11.25%  p.a.,  without  bias,  and  opted  for  monitoring  the  macroeconomic 
conjecture  and  thus  gain  time  to  deliberate  about  potential  changes  to  the  monetary  policy  in 
subsequent  meetings26.  As  the  expected  inflation  was  increasing,  COPOM  increased  the  Selic 
rate  in  50  bps  in  two  meetings.  Assuming  that  risks  of  increasing  prices  still  existed  in  July, 
COPOM  decided  to  increase  the  Selic  rate  to  13%  p.a.,  without  bias.  The  committee  still 
believed  in  a  tendency  of  increasing  prices  in  September  (the  already  mentioned  “benign 
scenario”). The committee, thus, opted for a new increase on 75 bps in the Selic rate, without 
bias,  even  in  a  scenario  of  international  economic  recession  (see  Graph  1).In  October  and 
December,  COPOM  finally  noticed  the  effects  of  the  economic  slowdown  and  the  increased 
economic  uncertainty  resulting  from  the  international  financial  crisis  that  was  also  affecting

26In April and June, however, the COPOM members assessed that the inflationary pressures -- that were initially 
localized -- could pose risks of increasing inflation. This risk was aggravated by the tight aggregate demand and the 
factor market, besides potential supply constraints in important sectors.

several  sectors  in  the  Brazilian  economy  (especially  the  credit  channels)  as  well  as  the 
consumers’  and  entrepreneurs’  confidence.27As  for  the  dynamics  of  monetary  aggregates,  a 
reduction  of  2.3%  was  registered  for  the  average  daily  balance  of  narrowly  defined  money 
supply  (M1).28M1  velocity  of  money  remained  relatively  stable,  and  the  monetary  base  (as 
measured according to the average daily balances) increased 1.5% in the year. The Central Bank 
of Brazil assumed other expansionary pressures on the monetary supply, which led to an increase 
of 933 million Brazilian Reais in the monetary base (using the criterion of available balance by 
the end of the period). The monetary authority, therefore, decided to implement changes to the 
rules of compulsory deposits, which translated into: reductions in rates, increases in the amounts 
to be deducted from callable reserves, changes in earnings on reserve requirements, together with 
discounts on amounts to be deposited as an incentive to negotiation of assets among medium- 
and small-sized financial institutions.29 

Graph  1  synthetizes  the  explanations  provided  so  far  and  shows  the  negative  effects  of 
having  increased  real  interest  rates  (benchmark  and  expected)  on  the  intrinsic  value  of  the 
Ibovespa theoretical portfolio. Obviously, the Ibovespa intrinsic value was also affected by other 
variables that are beyond the scope of the model such as:1) the default of the three mentioned 
financial  institutions,  and  worsening  animal  spirits  among  the  entrepreneurs  in  the  productive 
sector;  2)  reduced  volume  of  foreign  investments  in  shares  (Graph  2);  3)  the  devaluated  real 
exchange rate’s effect on the companies making up the Ibovespa theoretical portfolio; and 4) the 
remarkably reduced international trade flows.

27The  COPOM  analysis  pointed  to  the  need  of  preventing  inflationary  pressures  because  the  families'  rates  of 
consumption  growth  were  still  accelerated  despite  the  higher  stability  of  the  commodity  prices.Therefore,  the 
committee kept the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a., without bias, in both meetings.It trusted that the reduced liquidity in 
the international market and the expectation changes would help the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy 
and inhibit price increases (Graph 1).

As for the  Ibovespa performance, it is worth noting the Petrobras30  stock split that took 
place in the seventh week of the year31. In addition the period from January from May witnessed 
a  number  of  repeated  records  of  increased  index  values,  which  reached  73,516  point  on  May 
20th32. From late May to the end of  year, the Ibovespa experienced a sharp drop (of 42.1% in 
relation to the prevailing level by the end of 2007) and increased volatility. 33 

Graph 2 shows that the GV is positive until the 40th week and is negatively correlated with 
the real interest rates (benchmark and expected), as mentioned in the previous section.  34From 
then  on,  the  GV  is  negative,  reflecting  Lehman  Brothers',  Fannie  Mae's  ,  and  Freddie  Mac's 
collapse. 

This moment of structural collapse in the GV series evinces that the intrinsic value of the 
Ibovespa`s    theoretical  portfolio  declined  at  a  fast  pace  and  started  a  progressive  upside 
(tendency of profit)35.

31This explains the inflexion of both intrinsic and market value curves in the period, as Petrobras is the company is 
the greatest weight in the Ibovespa portfolio. 
32This was due to the positive effects derived from the upgrade of sovereign debt rating to investment grade that was 
granted by two risk rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s , and Fitch Ratings. 
33Therefore, the greatest value (that of May 20th) represented the bull market apex of a period that started in year 
2005 and experienced high Ibovespa returns.

variations depend on the IV elasticity, and on MV elasticity to both rates, as shown in matrix equations (12) and 
(14).Therefore, GV reduced significantly in 2008 as these rates increased from the 25th week to the end of the year. 
35A characteristic phenomenon of fundamental analyses based on the notion of value investing in periods of bear 
market.  
36Results  of  this  nature  are  of  special  interest  for  policy  makers  (especially  those  concerned  with  making  and 
executing  the  monetary  policy),  financial  executives,  and  the  representative  agent  of  the  computer-based  model.

4.3. Effect of the interest rates (benchmark and expected) on the Ibovespa intrinsic value 
and GV in 2009 

The quarterly growth rates of real GDP in 2009 showed that only the service sector was not 

affected by the financial crisis, which, as mentioned before, had its epicenter in August 2008. 
The industrial and agricultural GDPs reduced in the first three quarters of the year, and only 
improved in the last. 

The  consequences  of  the  world  crisis  worsened  from  the  last  quarter  2008,  when  the 
domestic economic activity faced strong recession in response to the reduced credit availability, 
worsened expectations, and increased levels of risk aversion. The external scenario changed at a 
fast pace, and the Central Bank of Brazil changed the contractionary orientation of the monetary 
policy, and reduced 500 bps of the base Selic rate. In late 2008, COPOM interrupted a series of 
four consecutive rate increases, which had started in the April meeting of that year and translated 
into a 250-basis-point increase of the Selic rate. In October and December, however, COPOM 
took the new scenario described before and unanimously took the decision to keep the Selic rate 
at 13.75% p.a., without bias. 

In the first meetings of 2009 (in January and March), COPOM decided to reduce the Selic 
rate in respectively 100 and 150 basis points. The decision built on the assumption that a strong 
inhibition  of  the  expected  inflation  and  the  reduced  economic  activity  would  make  IPCA 
(Extended National Consumer Price Index) follow a trajectory that would be consistent with the 
inflation targets determined by the  National Monetary Committee (CMN).  In March, COPOM 
understood that the reduced levels of economic activity was ensuring a level of idle capacity that 
could refrain the risks of worsening demand inflation despite the effects of adjusting the balance 
of  payments  and  persisting  with  transmission  mechanisms  in  some  contracts.  In  the  third  and 
fourth meetings (April and June), the committee promoted two reductions of 100 basis points in 
the  base  Selic  rates.  The  committee  recognized  that  such  measures  were  needed  to  gradually 
recover the industrial production rates, industry capacity utilization rates, employment rates, and 
both investors’ and consumers’ confidence. In the following meeting, in July, COPOM reduced 
the Selic rate in 50 bps to 8.75% p.a.; it kept this rate in the subsequent meetings, in September, 
October, and December, assuming that a more prudential attitude was needed.37 

As  for  the  monetary  aggregates,  the  expansionary  monetary  policy  implemented  in  mid-
20008 to remediate the effects of the intense contraction of credit both internally and externally 
produced  an  actual  increase38  of  5.7%  in  M1.  Despite  this  increase,  M139  velocity  of  money 
remained relatively stable in the year. The average daily balances of the monetary base increased 
14.9%  in  the  year  due  to  increases  to  its  components  (the  average  balance  of  issued  currency 
increased 14.3%, and bank reserves grew 16.8%40). In 2009, monetary aggregates M2, M3 and 
M4  enlarges  respectively  8.6%,  15.5%,  and  16.1%.  Graph  3  synthetizes  these  data  and  relate 
them to the time series of Ibovespa`s IV`s that was obtained using the model simulations. 
                                                                                                                                                                                               
They help policy makers and financial executives measure and detect speculative bubbles in the share market. They 
also inform the model representative agent’s decision: if the GV is declining and the agent trust in a positive future 
scenario  for the Ibovespa tendency  in the long term,  s/he  will opt  for increasing investments  in this  index; if  the 
value is increasing, however, s/he  may decide to  keep his/her levels of  investments or sell shares  if this  increase 
magnitude is great enough to yield him/her the desired profit. 
37The real expected interest rates (or ex-ante defined) declined from January to July in the year under scrutiny1.In the 
interest  derivatives  market,  the  interfinancial  swap  deposit  contracts  (DI)  x  360-day  pre-DI  swap  registered 
decreasing rates in the first semester 2009, dropping to the lowest rate of 8.97 p.a. in July. A reversal took place in 
this  downward  trend  in  the  expected  interest  rates  throughout  the  second  semester  of  the  year.  By  the  end  of 
December,  the  rates  of  the  negotiated  contracts  was  10.46%  p.a.,  a  level  171  bps  lower  than  that  registered  in 
December 2008.

5.3. Effect of the interest rates (benchmark and expected) on the Ibovespa intrinsic value 
and GV in 2010 

As  for  the  real  interest  rates  (both  benchmark  and  expected  rates),  COPOM  kept  the 
targeted Selic rate at 8.75% p.a. throughout the first quarter of 2010.In other words, the targeted 
base interest rate was kept at 8.75 in the two first COPOM meeting of the year, the lowest rate in 
a series that began in 1999. In the subsequent meetings, however, which took place in the second 
and third quarters, COPOM made a series of increases in the rate that summed up 200 bps. In the 
last three meetings of the year, the committee kept the rate at 10.75% p.a.45. The  yearly  IPCA 
(Extended National Consumer Price Index) reached 5.91%, which was close to the upper limit of 
a range of 2.5% to 6.5% that was defined as inflation target for 2010 by the National Monetary 
Council (CMN). As a result, the effective accumulated Selic rate was 9.7% in 2010, while the 
real  accumulated  Selic  rate  deflated  by  IPCA  hit  3.7%.The  expected  real  rate46  jumped  from 
5.1% in the end of 2009 to 6.2% p.a. in the end of 2010. In the second semester, however, the 

                                                            
44In fact, investors turned opted for variable-income assets (the foreign investments in shares increased substantially 
as shown in Graph 2).The GV trajectory in Graph 6 reflects this upward tendency. 
45Such  an  interest  policy  was  implemented  in  response  to  the  inflationary  pressures  related  to  the  increased 
commodity prices (from the international economy perspective) and the inconsistency between the aggregate supply 
growth and the expansion of domestic demand (from the domestic economy perspective).

contracts proved to be volatile and ended up negotiated at 12.03% p.a. by the end of 201047. In 
December, CMN and the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Brazil decided to implement 
some  measures  aimed  at  strengthening  the  financial  regulation  and,  therefore,  sustaining  the 
stability  of  the  financial  institutions  that  make  up  the  National  Financial  System  (SFN)  and 
ensuring a safe process  of credit market expansion. These measures became known as macro-
prudential regulatory measures48. Still, they needed to be articulated with  COPOM’s policy  of 
base  interest  rates.  Accordingly,  COPOM  assessed  at  the  last  meeting  of  the  year  that  the 
economic  scenario  showed  no  major  risks  of  aggravating  the  until-then  benign  process  of

also shows a negative correlation between both series of interest rates (benchmark and expected) 
and the series of IV and MV. 

The  public  offering  of  Petrobras`  stocks  reached  a  trading  volume  of  120.2  billion 
Brazilian Reais, a number that boosted the primary offering of debentures, promissory notes, and 
shares  listed  in  the  Brazilian  Security  Exchange  Commission  (CVM)  in  2010.The  volume 
increased 341% in relation to the previous year50. The correlation level between IV and MV was 
99% in the period. 

In 2010, the Brazilian economy saw a GPD growth rate of 7.5%.Such a rate had not been 
recorded for over two decades. Nevertheless, the worsening expectations about the US economy 
indexes,  along  with  the  reduced  credit  availability  in  China  and  the  fiscal  crises  in  important 
Eurozone  countries  (i.e.,  Portugal,  Greece,  Spain,  Italy,  and  France)  caused  considerably 
increased  uncertainty  in  the  productive  and  financial  market  worldwide,  which  eventually 
reduced the Ibovespa companies' MV.  

In the second quarter, the international scenario remained alarming and led investors who 
usually buy variable-income assets to focus their concern on the European fiscal crisis effects on 
the very Europe countries and on the Chinese economy. Such concerns reflected the fact that the 
export dynamics of several major Brazilian companies is strongly linked to the market growth in 
China, Europa and the USA – the Chinese market having increasingly gained more importance 
than the others in the last ten years). Foreign investments also declined in the first quarters of the 
year. They dropped to  U$ 274 billion in the first quarter  and hit U$ 622 billion in the second 
quarter – still quite lower than the U$ 2.99 trillion in the last quarter of 200951.  

In addition to this downturn scenario of the world economy, the domestic conjuncture also 
imposed  more  inflationary  pressure  and  eventually  caused  COPOM  to  pursue  a  cycle  of 
increased Selic rates. In turn, the interest rates and the foreign investors’ expectations caused a 
declining trend in the GV of the Ibovespa theoretical portfolio. 

 

 

 

 
 

                                                            
47This rate was 157 bps higher than the rate registered by the end of 2009. 
48Two  of  them  were  especially  relevant:1)  increased  compulsory  reserve  requirements;  and  2)  increased  capital 
requirements for operations involving credit to individuals for periods longer than 24 months. 
49The  Committee,  however,  opted  for  wait  some  time  to  contemplate  the  impacts  of  the  increased  Selic  rates 
(implemented since early 2010) and the macroprudential measures (adopted in December) on the IPCA evolution. 
The maintenance of the Selic rate in the December meeting was based on this analysis of the committee. 
50The  market  value  of  the  companies  making  up  the  Ibovespa  theoretical  portfolio  increased  10.1%  in  2010.It 
reached  2.6  trillion  Brazilian  reais  in  December,  while  it  had  been  2.3  trillion  in  the  year  before.  The  Bovespa 
average daily trading volume increased 22.4% in the year, totalizing 6.4 billion Brazilian reais.

In the third quarter -- more specifically in September --, the Ibovespa reached the historical 
record  of  ca.  70,000  points.52The  IPCA  rates  were  indicating  that  the  inflationary  process  had 
been restrained, and the Focus Report pointed a growth of 7% in the Brazilian economy by the 
end of 2010.Consequently, Brazil saw an inconsistency between its strong economic growth and 
the  the  I  bovespa  growth  setback  (60,000  points).This  inconsistency  was  associated  with  the 
effects  of  the  European  crisis53  and  the  Brazilian  investors’  replacement  of  variable-income 
assets with fixed-income assets. Despite this adverse scenario, the GV behavior was found to be 
largely positive. The higher MV compared to IV pointed to a downside condition.54

 

 

6. Final remarks 

The  computer-based  financial  model  herein  described  is  a  multi-agent  model  and 
incorporates techniques from finance (the share valuation model), computational economics, and 
monetary economics. 

The  agents  in  the  model  are  the  shareholders  of  the  companies  making  up  the  Ibovespa 
theoretical portfolio. These agents’ expectations are linked to these companies’ profit rates. The 
expected profit rates are combined – in a valuation formula, i.e., that of free cash flow to the firm 
– with the benchmark and expected interest rates, which serve as inter-temporal discounting rates 
or minimum attractive rates for negotiating the given shares)55. 

The model has first estimated the cash flows of all Ibovespa`s company in all the years of 
the triennium under analysis. Subsequently, it has projected the flows to years 2011 and 2012, 
and then discounted them to obtain intrinsic value estimates for every stock. These estimates are 
summed  up  and  weighted  according  to  their  contribution  share  to  the  Ibovespa`s  theoretical 
portfolio. The total result is the IV estimate of the Ibovespa. Finally, the herein proposed notion 
of GV is deduced, this being the difference between Ibovespa’s market and intrinsic values. This 
series of GV index is useful to detect and measure speculative bubbles in the financial market as 
well  as  bear  market  conditions. The model methodology has drawn  from readings of  Lebaron 
(2006),  Testfasion  (2006)  and  Judd  (2006).They  all  have  built  on  the  seminal  work  by 
Testfatsion  &  Judd  (2006).Besides  these  texts,  this  paper  also  draws  on  insights  of  simulation 
and  calibration  techniques  as  described  in  Law  &  Kelton  (1991),  Werker  &  Brenner  (2004), 
Menner (1995) and Miranda (2002). 

The  analysis  of  the  model  results  evinces  the  correlation  between  the  series  of  intrinsic 
values and market value and the correlation between the weekly series of IV and of GV with the 
trajectories of the benchmark and expected interest rates. In addition, the analysis also sought to 
show  the  effect  of  exogenous  factors  on  the  series  under  study.  In  other  words,  it  sought  to 
correlate  the  model-generated  trajectories  with  such  events  as  the  US  financial  institution's 
default, the Petrobras` stock split, the expansionary  fiscal  and monetary policy  adopted by the 

                                                            
52This was an event with strong impact on Petrobras capitalization in the Bovespa, which reached ca. 30.4 billion 
Brazilian reais. 
53Approximately one-third of the Bovespa activities refer to foreign investors. 
54The GV was negative only in the period between the 9th and the 22th weeks of the year. That is, the COPOM-
defined interest rates increased, while IV declined in the period; even so IV was higher than MV, indicating upside 
in this short period of time. This observation can be seen in Graph 9. 
55According  to  Bodie,  Kane  &  Marcus  (2009),  share  valuation  techniques  can  be  top-down  or  bottom-up  in 
fundamental analysis. The analyst uses the former when s/he first desires to assess the macroeconomic environment, 
then the sector in which the company operates, and finally the company’s accounting statements and management 
quality.  Inversely,  s/eh  uses  the  second  technique  when  s/he  desires  to  assess:  first  the  company's  accounting 
statements and  management  quality, then its sector, and finally the  macroeconomic environment of the company. 
The model herein described used the bottom-up approached, as multi-agent computational simulations are usually 
used with a view to studying complexes tendencies that emerge from the micro level of the systems to their macro 
level.

Brazilian  government,  the  macro-prudential  decisions  of  market  regulation,  and  the  European 
financial crisis. 

Another  relevant  conclusion  of  the  model  is  the  transmission  mechanism  of  monetary 
policy  will  affect  Ibovespa`s  GV  negatively  only  when  the  companies  that  make  up  this  index 
have, aggregated negative net cash generation.
