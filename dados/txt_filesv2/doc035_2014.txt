Resumo 

O presente artigo investiga se as empresas industriais brasileiras possuem restrições de crédito por meio do uso 
de  base  de  dados  com  mais  de  3.000  firmas  brasileiras  do  setor  industrial,  com  características  que  podem 
influenciar  o  grau  de  restrição  de  crédito,  tais  como,  tamanho,  listagem  na  bolsa  de  valores  e  capacidade  de 
exportação.    Nossos  resultados  indicam  que  todas  as  dimensões  aqui  consideradas,  ou  seja,  firmas  maiores, 
aquelas  listadas  na  bolsa  de  valores  ou  que  possuem  alta  capacidade  exportadora  estão  associados  a  níveis 
menores de restrição de crédito ou até mesmo a inexistência desta. Mais especificamente, no que se refere ao 
tamanho  das  firmas,  nossos  resultados  vão ao encontro  do  previsto  na  teoria e dos  resultados  encontrados  na 
literatura internacional. Esses resultados diferem dos encontrados por Aldrighi & Bisinha (2010). Terra (2003), 
por sua vez, consegue resultados similares apenas para um período limitado. Além disso, os efeitos de ser listada 
e exportadora não são influenciados pelo tamanho. Mesmo as pequenas ou médias firmas não trazem indício de 
restrição de crédito quando listadas na bolsa ou quando possuem alta capacidade exportadora.

Abstract 

This paper analyses whether industrial Brazilian firms are credit restricted. In order to do so, we use a database 
with more than 3,000 brazilian firms from the manufacture sector with features that can influence the degree of 
credit restriction, as size, being listed in stock markets and the level of exports’ sales. Our results show that all 
dimensions  considered  here,  greater  size,  listed  in  the  stock  market,  and  export  capacity,  are  associated  with 
inexistence or less credit restriction. More specifically related to size effects, our results are in accordance with 
theory and the results presented in the international literature. These results, however, differ from Aldrighi and 
Bisinha  (2010)  in  their  analysis  of  Brazilian  firms.  We  provide  results  in  accordance  with  Terra  (2003)  for 
Brazil, although her estimates are found only for a limited time span. Moreover, the  influence of being public 
and  an  exporter  is  beyond  any  possible  correlation with  size:  even  small  firms  are  not  restricted  when  either 
being listed in the stock market or with high export revenue.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Credit constraint is a widespread  market failure, especially in developing countries, as evidenced by 
Banerjee  and  Duflo  (2005).  Its  adverse  consequences,  inhibiting  entrepreneur  capacity  to  make 
investments,  are  particularly  important  to  these  countries,  which  needs  to  accumulate  capital  and 
implement innovations to accelerate growth. 

This  paper  investigates  whether  Brazilian  companies  are  credit  constrained  considering  the 
investment-cash  flow  model  proposed  by  Fazzari,  Hubbard  and  Petersen  (FHP,  1988).  The  main 
interest  in  this  case  is  to  verify  the  sensitiveness  of  firm’s  investment  to  cash  flow  as  synonyms  of 
credit constraint. The use of a large and yet few exploited dataset is one of the main contribution of the 
paper. It contains balance sheet information for more than 3,000 industrial firms with characteristics 
that  may  affect  the  degree  of  credit  constraints,  for  example,  size,  the  participation  in  the  Brazilian 
stock market and level of export’s sales. 

Despite  heterogeneity  in  our  sample,  presence  of  non-listed  firms  imposes  some  difficulties.  In 
particular,  Tobin’s  Q  can  not  be  used  as  a  proxy  for  investments  opportunities.  This  problem  is 
circumvented  by  using  multiple  proxies  controlling  for  investment  opportunities.  For  instance,  we 
consider  variation  of  sales  at  firm  level  and  sector  variation  in  investment  and  in  value  added  at  an 
aggregate level in order to control for investment opportunities. 

Our main results indicate  that Brazilian firms were credit constrained in recent  years (2008-2010). 
Cash flow coefficient is indeed larger than what is usually obtained in the literature for other countries, 
such as Carpenter and Guariglia (2008), suggesting a higher degree of imperfections in the Brazilian 
credit market. Furthermore, this coefficient is different when firms are classified according to the three 
categories that may properly approximate the degree of credit constraint: size, listed on stock markets 
and the level of export’s sales. In the first case, Brazilian firms are classified as small, middle and large 
considering the number of employees. Although previous evidence that analyses the impact of size on 
credit  restrictions  has  been  mixed  in  Brazil,  as  observed  in  Terra  (2003)  and  Aldrighi  and  Bisinha 
(2010), our results are in line with the traditional literature: cash flow coefficient is insignificant or at 
least (depending on the econometric specification) has a lower elasticity magnitude for larger firms. 

Our two other categories, companies listed on the Brazilian stock market (public versus non-public 
firms)  and  level  of  export  to  sales  ratio  (no  export  at  all,  below  and  above  the  median)  provide 
evidence  that  investments  for  firms  listed  in  stock  markets  and  for  those  large  exporters  are  not 
sensitive  to  cash  flow  variation.  Besides,  the  influence  of  these  categories  is  beyond  any  possible 
correlation with size. When interacting those dummies, listed and export, with size groups, our results 
suggest that while no-large firms are in general credit constrained, this credit restriction was softened 
for  listed  firms  and  large  exporters.  In  this  context,  understanding  stock  market  participation  as  a 
“domestic”  source  of  external  investment’s  funds  and  the  level  of  export’s  sales  as  a  proxy  for 
“foreign”  source,  once  export  revenue  may  be  seen  as  a  collateral  to  get  access  to  international 
financing, our results suggest that these firms’ characteristics are effective to evaluate their degree of 
credit restrictions.1 

In  order  to  perform  our  investigation,  this  paper  is  structured  in  5  sections  apart  from  this 
introduction.  Section  2  provides  a  brief  survey  of  the  literature.  Section  3  presents  methodology  to 
analyze  credit  restriction.  Data  description  is  presented  in  Section  4  as  well  as  some  descriptive 
statistics  on  the  main  variables.  Next,  we  present  and  discuss  our  results,  followed  by  robustness 
outcomes. Last section concludes.

or to export, especially the requisites of transparency, is what is relevant to suppress credit constraints.

2. RELATION TO THE LITERATURE AND THE BRAZILIAN CONTEXT 
 
In  a  world  of  perfect  capital  markets,  without  transaction  costs  and  taxes,  the  Modigliani-Miller 
Theorem  asserts  that  financial  structure  of  firms  are  irrelevant  for  their  real  decisions,  in  particular 
investments. But in reality all these assumptions are non-valid, and a special focus of the literature has 
been  the  case  of  asymmetric  information.  The  asymmetries  in  financial  markets  may  be  due  to 
differential information about types, where borrowers have more information about their projects risks 
or managerial abilities than creditors, or due to difficult verifiability of actions, where creditors cannot 
observe investment choices or the real capacity of repayment from borrowers. The main consequence 
is  a  gap  between  the  internal  (for  example,  retained  profits)  and  external  (for  example,  bank  credit) 
cost of funds, explained by the creditor need to raise funds to compensate risk of bad quality borrowers 
(the adverse selection problem) or costly monitoring (the moral hazard problem) (Stiglitz and Weiss, 
1981). 

An  empirical  testable  implication  of  higher  costs  from  external  sources  is  that  increases  in  firm`s 
cash flow must push more investment. Moreover, as supposed by major part of the literature, another 
implication should be a more sensitive correlation between cash flow and investment in firms where 
information costs (and hence the gap between the internal and external costs of funds) are higher. 

The seminal researchers testing these hypotheses were Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen (FHP, 1988). 
They split a sample of US firms in three categories regarding dividend payments, high, medium and 
low, and showed that the relation between cash flows and investments were significantly higher in the 
last  group,  which  corroborates  the  hypothesis  when  one  assumes  that  these  kind  of  firms  are  more 
likely to suffer credit restrictions.  

This paper lead to an extensive empirical literature, where two main themes have been emphasized: 
the need to control in an appropriate manner for investment opportunities, where otherwise a positive 
association between cash flow and investment may simply say that better opportunities induce firms 
investment and at the same time impact cash today, and a critic of the basic methodology employed in 
FHP regarding the criteria for splitting the firms in different classes of information costs. 

Concerning the first problem, the initial proxy used for controlling investment opportunities, Tobin`s 
Q, was criticized because what can be constructed using real data (mean Q) is equivalent to what in 
theory reflect investments opportunities (marginal Q) only under strong assumptions. Moreover, since 
Tobin`s  Q,  as  the  ratio  between  firm  market  value  and  recomposition  cost  of  capital,  only  reflects 
investment  opportunities  from  an  outside  point  of  view,  which  may  not  properly  capture  real 
opportunities under imperfect capital markets (Carpenter and Guariglia, 2008). Besides, this proxy is 
simply absent when one analyses data with non-traded firms (Baum et al., 2011; Guariglia et al., 2011). 
The  response  to  this  problem  has  been  mixed  in  the  literature,  ranging  from  the  development  of 
alternative  proxies  that  can  better  capture  investment  opportunities  to  a  change  in  methodology  that 
abandons the necessity of using Tobin’s Q. For the first approach, prospect of future expense in capital 
goods  is  used  to  complement  information  in  Tobin’s  Q  in  order  to  capture  the  internal  view  of 
opportunities (Carpenter and Guariglia, 2008), or more aggregate variables are used in this regard, as 
industry-level value-added growth when data base contains firms not traded publicly (Guariglia, Liu e 
Song, 2011). For the second, it is better exemplified by the “Euler equation approach” to the problem, 
where one tests if the firms’ investment behavior is consistent with the first-order condition that may 
prevail when they solve  a dynamic programming problem under perfect  markets (Bond and Meghir, 
1994). Although many of these proposed solutions may be ingenious, the fact is that it is really very 
hard to do a proper control. Most studies are subject to the critic that a statistically positive correlation 
between cash flow and investment may reflect mis-measured investment opportunities.    

Another  challenge  to  this  literature  is  given  by  how  to  classify  firms  regarding  to  levels  of 
information costs. In an influential paper, Kaplan and Zingales (KZ, 1997) argued that theoretically the 
relation  between  the  dependence  of  investments  to  internal  funds  and  information  costs  was  not 

2 

 

necessarily  monotonic.  They  reviewed  the  seminal  article  of  FHP,  and  splitting  their  low  dividend 
payment  sample  with  respect  to  the  probability  of  liquidity  need,  they  showed  that  in  firms  more 
propense to be short of liquidity, the relation between cash flow and investment was weaker, contrary 
to the original hypothesis sustained by FHP. Moreover, an interesting insight raised by KZ is that it is 
difficult  to  say  if  this  result  is  at  odds  with  the literature  so  far,  because  in  many  known  papers  the 
financial criteria used to classify firms between more or less credit restricted may not correspond to the 
real information costs and hence effective credit constraint of this firms: for instance, firms linked to a 
bank  (conglomerates)  may  be  less  credit  constrained  under  an  adverse  selection  story  where  the 
“lemons risk” limits access to capital markets, but otherwise may be more financially dependent under 
a story of monopsonic power of incumbent creditor. 

KZ paper was the origin of a huge controversy in this literature, with some authors reaffirming KZ 
findings  (Clearly,  1999)  while  others  criticizing  their  approach  (for  instance,  Hubbard  1998  or 
Allayannis and  Mozumdar, 2004). One of the main arguments against  KZ is that  firms classified as 
most  prone  to  suffer  illiquidity  are  in  general  financially  distressed,  where  creditors  may  seize  their 
new  generated  funds as  repayment for old debts weakening in this way the relationship cash flow – 
investment.  Beyond  this  controversy,  a  point  that  must  warm  researchers  refers  to  the  properly 
classification  of  firms  by  categories  that  really  measure  information  costs.  In  fact,  Cleary  (2007) 
arguments  that  the  sensitivity  of  cash  flow  –  investment  between  firms  with  more  or  less  financial 
restriction depends crucially on what variables are used to classify firms as credit constrained. 

The relation between investment and cash-flow was also studied in Brazil. In fact, the structure of 
Brazilian  capital  markets  is  suggestive  that  firms  may  be  subject  to  credit  constraints.  While  the 
banking system is considered robust and sophisticated, the segment of long term credit is a point of 
weakness,  being  covered  almost  exclusively  by  state-owned  institutions.  The  market  for  corporate 
bonds is incipient, due, for instance, to the difficult of developing a secondary market that may provide 
liquidity for potential investors. On the other hand, stock market is relatively well developed, but only 
a few firms have access to it. 

Terra (2003) is one of the main references in the Brazilian literature. More recently, we can cite the 
work of Aldrighi and Bisinha (2010). The general conclusion of these authors is that Brazilian firms 
are indeed credit-constrained. However, in odds with the conventional literature, firms that should be 
more credit constrained when using some standard measure (size, for instance) do not appear to have a 
more significant coefficient in the investment – cash flow equation. In Terra (2003), the hypothesis that 
the  cash  flow  coefficient  is  equal  for  large  and  small  firms  cannot  be  rejected,  unless  in  a  limited 
period  of  time  (1994-1997)  when  credit  constraints  were  softer  among  large  firms2.  In  Aldrighi  and 
Bisinha (2010), the cash flow coefficient is always significant, and indeed increases with firm size. The 
authors suggest that financial difficulties between firms with smaller size may explain their findings, as 
the desire to maintain a “financial slack” avoiding in this way future liquidity problems may weaken 
the investment – cash flow relationship.  

A  main  feature  of  both  papers  is  that  they  use  information  of  firms  which  are  required  by  law  to 
make their balance sheet data public, since their shares are available in the stock market. As mentioned 
in  the  introduction,  we  contribute  to  this  literature  by  analyzing  also  firms  not  listed  in  the  stock 
market, which correspond to the major part of Brazilian firms. And for the two main concerns of the 
literature cited before, our paper controls for investment opportunities using variables at the firm, as 
well  as  at  the  sectorial  level.  Furthermore,  regarding  the  classification  of  firms  within  different 
information  costs,  we  believe  that  the  categories  we  use,  size,  access  to  capital  markets,  and  export 
capacity, can properly measure credit constraints.

For eliminating firm-effect, we estimate equation (1) by fixed-effect and first-difference. Time-effect 
is  controlled  by  imposing  dummies  for  instant  t.  Furthermore,  to  control  for  industry-effect,  another 
way  to  embody  investment  opportunities,  we  have  included  dummies  for  each  industry  j  interacted 
with time dummies in all estimated models.             

The  OLS  in  first-difference  may  present  the  problem  of  endogeneity.  Due  to  this  fact,  we  apply 
Generalized Method of Moments approach (GMM) based on Arelano and Bover (1995) and Blundell 
and Bond (1998). This approach combines the standard set of equations in first-difference with lagged 
levels  of  regressors  as  instruments,  with  the  incorporation  of  equations  in  levels  with  lagged  first-
difference as instruments.                        
The  parameter  of  interest  is  dˆ .  In  the  presence  of  imperfection  in  credit  market,  the  estimated 
coefficient  dˆ  should be positive and statistically significant, i.e., the firm’s investment is sensitive to 
the cash flow, as discussed previously.  

Although the main aim of the paper is to evaluate whether Brazilian manufacturing firms are credit 
constraint,  we  also  investigate  whether  there  are  differences  in  the  cash  flow  coefficient  across  the 
following groups of firms: (i) their size, evaluated by number of employees; (ii) whether they are listed 
or not on the stock market; and (iii) the level of firm’s exports, given by the ratio between exports and 
sales  revenue.  All  these  classifications  allow  coefficients  of  control  variables  to  differ  across 
observations in the distinct sub-samples and it will indicate the level of financial constraints faced by 
firms. Thus, cash flow variable may be interacted with different dummies variables:

4. DATA AND SUMMARY STATISTICS 
 

In  order  to  evaluate  the  link  between  cash  flow  and  investment,  we  use  four  different  sources. 
SERASA  is  the  main  source  as  it  contains  balance  sheet  information  for  more  than  28  thousand 

4

Brazilian firms with annual revenue over R$ 10 million (around US$ 5 million)3. From this dataset, we 
use  different  measures:  capital,  investment,  cash  flow  and  sale’s  revenue.  Capital  is  the  fixed  assets 
value of each firm and investment is its variation. Cash flow is measured by Earnings Before Interest, 
Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). The dataset comprehends all sectors of the economy 
from 2006 to 2010, yet focus here will be given to industry sector from 2007 to 2010.  

There are two reasons for this restriction. First, investment opportunities data is only available for the 
industry sector among 2007 and 2010. Basically, sectorial investment opportunities variables are given 
by the industry-level value added growth as well as the industry-level of fixed asset growth. These two 
variables  are  obtained  from  PIA-IBGE  database  (Brazilian  Annual  Survey  of  Industry).  Second, 
industrial firm level data for 2006 is very reduced, including less than 1,000 firms. It is different from 
the period among 2007 and 2010 with more than 3,000 industrial firms. Therefore, we focused on firm 
level data starting in 2007 in order to keep cross-section information as wider as possible.  

Two  other  sources  are  utilized  for  this  investigation.  Number  of  employees  of  each  firm  from  the 
Annual Social Information Report (Relação Anual de Informações Sociais – [RAIS]) of the Ministry of 
Labor is used to control for size. Additionally, information of the Foreign Trade Secretary (Secretaria 
de  Comércio  Exterior  –  [SECEX])  of  the  Ministry  of  Industrial  Development  and  Foreign  Trade 
regarding how much each firm has exported is considered.  

To control for potential influence of outliers, we exclude firms with observations in the one percent 
tails of each of investment and cash flow variables. Finally, if firm’s information is missing in any year 
from the period, we dropped it. Our final data consists of a balanced panel with 3,343 firms related to 
all industrial sectors. We divide our sample in three ways: listed on the Brazilian stock market (Listed); 
and large firms compared to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME); and their export status. As seen, 
the majority of firms in our sample are not listed in the stock market as well as they are SME.

As shown in Table 1, firms in our sample have around 246 employees where their exports represent 
only 6% of their revenues. Overall, figures represent what is expected: Firms listed on the stock market 
are larger in any term either by the number of employees. Regarding investment over capital, Brazilian 
firms in the industrial sector invest  around  a quarter of its capital every  year. Moreover, there is no 
large difference between them, even when considering among the three categories defined above. What 
is striking is that firms not listed on the Brazilian stock market, SME and low exporters generate on 
average cash flow around their capital stock. On the other hand, large firms generate only 63% cash 
flow compared to its capital, public firms generate 44% and high exporters, 75%.  

Moreover, considering these descriptive statistics, we may infer that SME firms, for instance, might 
be credit restricted since they have to generate much more cash flow in order to invest at the same rate 
as  large  firms.  The  same  interpretation  might  be  done  for  those  not  listed  on  the  stock  market.  An 
important  difference  emerges  in  export  status.  Investment  rate  in  large  exporters  is  lower  than  no-
exporters or those exporting below the median. However, their capacity to generate funds is lower than 
those other two  groups.  In other words, it seems that being a large  exporter enables them to be less

restricted.  All  these  outcomes  are  rough  evidences  which  should  be  corroborated  by  econometric 
scrutiny. 

Finally,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  SERASA  database  consists  mainly  in  no-listed  firms, 
covering a huge range of size. In this way, our study appears more suited for an investigation of credit 
restrictions than the ones focused on firms listed on stock markets, which are larger than the average 
firm  in  a  developing  country  like  Brazil.  Furthermore,  it  is  worth  to  mention  that  there  are  correct 
incentives  for  firms  to  provide  true  information  to  SERASA,  because  this  information  may  be 
disclosed  to  the  banking  system  and  contributing  to  potential  access  to  credit  in  more  favorable 
conditions. The dataset is indeed representative of the Brazilian industrial sector, covering 27% of total 
revenues and 43% of total employment in the manufacturing sector.4  
 
5. EMPIRICAL RESULTS 
 
Our  results  from  specification  (1)  are  presented  in  Table  2.  Using  data  from  2008  to  2010,5  three 
approaches are explored: pooled ordinary least square (OLS); within groups (WG); and SYS-GMM. In 
the case of GMM approach, instruments are available for 2008. As said, two variables are applied as 
covariates in order to capture the sectorial investment opportunities effect: the industry-level of value 
. At the firm level, 
added growth 
we impose the firm’s annual sales growth variable 
 in order to control also for investment 
opportunities. Time dummies and time dummies interacted with industry dummies were included in all

All  estimated  models  have  evidenced  that  firms  are  credit  constraint  even  after  controlling  by 
industry-level variables. However, cash flow coefficients estimated by GMM have a superior impact 
when  compared  to  others  methods.  This  result  may  indicate  that  within  groups  estimates  may  still 
suffer from endogeneity bias.

Both  sales  and  industry  investment  growth  are  only  significant  for  pooled  OLS  estimates. 
Controlling  for  firm-effect,  value  added  growth  became  statistically  significant  at  the  10%  level, 
nonetheless,  with  a  wrong  signal.  The  model  in  column  6  reveals  an  estimated  coefficient  equal  to 
0.25.  Evaluated  at  the  sample  mean,  this  indicates  an  elasticity  of  the  cash  flow  to  capital  ratio 
correspondent  to  0.98.  Indeed,  this  is  a  striking  result:  the  impact  of  cash  flow  on  investment  is 
practically  equivalent  to  the  unity.  The  estimated  coefficients  of  sales  growth  and  investment 
opportunities are not significant at the 10% level.    

We now evaluate the impact of cash flow on investment by classifying firms according to categories 
that may properly proxy for the degree of credit constraint. The first category considered is the firm’s 
size, as shown in Table 3. Due to the fact that pooled OLS and within  group coefficient may suffer 
from endogeneity problem, all models from now on are estimated only by system GMM. Table 3 is 
structured as follows: first column presents results without controls; second with controls not classified 
by firms’ size; third column shows results where only sector controls are divided according to firms’ 
size; last column presents outcomes where all controls are multiplied by firms’ size.6 

The  first  two  models  in  columns  1  and  2  indicate  that  all  cash  flow  estimated  coefficients  are 
significant  at  the  10%  level.  In  addition,  it  is  not  possible  to  reject  the  hypothesis  that  cash  flow 
coefficients are equal across groups, according to the p-value of 

2c  test at the bottom of Table 3. 

When covariates are also classified by size groups, as observed in columns 3 e 4, the coefficients of 
cash flow for large firms become non-significant as a result of a significant and positive influence of 
sales growth variable. One should note that the middle firm’s investment is still sensitive to cash flow 
even with the fact that the sales growth coefficient is positive and significant. The elasticity associated 
to cash flow of middle companies, evaluated at the mean, reaches 0.37. Considering the small group, 
the cash flow impact on investment is reduced when investment opportunities variables are considered, 
such that, the model’s elasticity in column 4, evaluated at the sample mean, is 0.60. This reduction may 
be explained by the presence of positive and significant impact of industry value of added growth.  

In all models, Sargan test reveals that instruments are valid. Given that in column 3 and 4 the cash 
flow  coefficient  for  large  groups  individually  is  not  significant  at  conventional  levels,  the  tests  that 
assess whether estimated coefficients are equal across groups associated to these models also include 
an additional null hypothesis, i.e., 
. As a result, the test reveals that estimated coefficient 
for large firms differs from the others groups. Otherwise, there is evidence that the impact of cash flow 
on investment is identical for small and middle firms.

When  all  variables  are  classified  by  size  groups,  we  observed  that  the  investment  opportunities 
variables have important information about firm’s investment. This outcome is essential given that the 
lack of control of the sales growth effect, for example, have misinterpreted the conclusion about the 
credit constraint validation for the group of large firms.

In all models, it is not possible to verify a positive and significant impact of cash flow on investment 
for public companies. As discussed previously, 35 manufacturing firms available in SERASA database 
are listed on the stock market, yielding 105 observations from 2008 to 2010. Even after controlling for 
sales growth and investment opportunities, only no-listed companies reveal that credit is restrict. In this

case, the elasticity, evaluated in the sample mean, is similar to GMM coefficients results of Table 2, 
given that the vast majority of firms compounding the database are not listed on the stock market.  

Furthermore, when assessing whether estimated coefficients are equal across both groups, with the 
exception  of  model  in  column  1,  the  null  hypothesis  is  not  rejected  at  conventional  level  for  three 
models, despite their isolated significance. 

Finally, the last way to evaluate the degree of credit constraint is classifying firms by their export to 
sales  ratio,  as  presented  in  Table  5.  As  discussed  before,  export  revenue  may  be  seen  as  potential 
collateral,  in  this  way  facilitating  access  to  international  financial  markets  and  alleviating  credit 
constraints.  

According to Table 5, with the exception of the first model, when firms have a large ratio of export 
over  sales,  the  impact  of  cash  flow  on  investment  is  statistically  null  as  a  consequence  of  the 
significant  effect  of  the  control  variables,  specially,  sales  growth  and  industry-level  of  investment 
growth. On the other hand, financial constraint condition remains valid for both no-exporters and low-
export firms.   

The model in column 4 has an elasticity of cash flow on investment for non-exporters, evaluated at 
the  sample  mean,  equal  to  0.52,  whereas  elasticity  for  lower  exporters  is  smaller  (exactly  0.35). 
However,  taking  into  account  that  the  cash  flow  impact  is  null  for  the  high-export  group,  the  null 
hypothesis of the test that assumes that coefficients are equal across these groups is not rejected at the 
10% level. In fact, only in the case of large exporters, it is possible to reject the null hypothesis. 

Comparing  these  outcomes  with  that  related  to  the  models  in  Table  3,  we  can  found  some 
similarities.  Firstly,  the  proxy  variables  for  investment  opportunities  are  important  to  explain  firm’s 
investment.  Furthermore,  they  alter  the  magnitude  of  cash  flow  coefficient  associated  to  the  groups 
with  high  level  of  credit  constraint.  The  most  important  evidence  is  that  without  the  presence  of 
covariates,  the  cash  flow  is  always  significant  even  for  the  group  with  the  lowest  degree  of  credit 
constraint.

6 – ROBUSTNESS CHECKS 

              

In  our  previous  analysis,  it  is  possible  that  listed  firms  on  stock  markets  and  their  export  shares  on 
sales  are  really  not  size  independent.  Instead,  larger  firms  tend  to  be  over-represented  in  these  two 
groups,  such  that,  the  credit  constraint  degree  measured  by  these  two  classifications  is  again  an 
evaluation between large and non-large firms. To prevent this kind of effect, these groups (firms listed 
or not on the stock market and export’s share) are interacted to groups of size. Tables 6 and 7 report 
these results. 

Table  6  presents  the  estimated  models  considering  four  different  firm’s  groups  created  by  the 
interaction between dummies of firms listed or not on stock market and size. As both small and middle 
size firms  have  evidenced that cash flow coefficient is statistically equal  across  groups  (see Table 3 
outcomes),  we  re-classify  them  into  large  and  no-large  firms.  The  latter  includes  small  and  middle 
enterprises (SME). The main reason for this procedure is to create different financial constraints groups 
with sufficient number of observation. This is an important procedure given that there is only one small 
firm listed on the stock market while middle size companies sum eleven. 

   According to columns 1 to 3 of Table 6, the estimated models continue to evidence that credit is 
constrained for closed firms. Considering the model in column 4, only the group of unlisted and no-
large firms have evidenced that credit is constrained as a consequence of the significant and positive 
impact of the sales firm’s growth variable. Hence, Brazilian firms listed on the stock market are not 
credit  constraint  and  this  condition  is  valid  even  for  non-large  firms.  Associated  to  this  result,  with 
exception of the model in column 2, the test that evaluate whether cash flow impact on investment are 
equal across no-large firms reveals that the null hypothesis is rejected.  

In  general, size classification does not influence the  general results about the relationship between 
cash  flow  and  firms  listed  on  the  stock  market.  Regardless  size  interaction,  the  investments  of 
companies listed on BMF&BOVESPA is not sensitive to cash flow. In this sense, there is evidence that 
this classification is not capturing size effect. It seems a good proxy for the degree of firm’s external 
financial  constraint  related  to  a  type  of  domestic  accessibility  to  credit  resources.  A  possible 
explanation for this is related to the prerequisites to become a public company. Public companies must 
have  independently  audited  balance  sheets,  protect  minority  shareholders,  among  other  corporate 
governance  issues.  These  restrictions  provide  a  positive  signaling  to  capital  markets  and  might, 
therefore, help to alleviate credit constraints.      

Furthermore, it is important to point out that, in the model in column 4 the elasticity for closed and 
non-large companies, evaluated at sample mean, is 0.66, i.e., the impact of 1.0% in cash flow implies 
an  increase  of  0.66%  in  investment,  similar  to  the  elasticity  of  small  firms  groups  in  regressions  of 
Table 2. Moreover, the coefficient of value added growth for no-large and closed companies is positive 
and  significant.  Nevertheless,  opportunity  investment  information  does  not  affect  the  significance  of 
cash flow on firm’s investment.

Table 7 reports the outcomes related to the models where variables are classified by firm’s size and 
by the firm’s degree of exports to sales ratio, together. One should note that, as shown in Table 5, both, 
no-exporters as well as low-export firms are credit constrained and coefficients associated to them are 
statistically equal across the two groups. In this sense, we reclassify them into the following groups:  
 referring to firms with exports to sales ratio which falls below the 50th percentile of 
EXP
the export to sales ratio distribution, and 

 indicates the opposite.

Considering the same export group, with the exception of model 2, firm’s size does not influence the 
impact of cash flow on investment, especially when dummies interactions are extended to the control 
variables. Similarly to the general results of Table 5, the cash flow coefficient is statistically null for 
large exporters. Focusing on firms with significant cash flow impact, i.e., the no-high exporters group 
(firms with zero or low export to ratio sales), there is not strong evidence that the coefficients across 
these two groups are different. 

In this sense, interacting export groups to the firm’s size do not affect the mainly results reported in 
Table  5.  It  suggests  that  export  status  proposed  here  does  not  capture  size  effect.  Otherwise,  as 
discussed,  this  classification  may  be  associated  to  our  perspective,  i.e.  the  degree  of  firm’s  external 
financial constraint.  

Finally,  one  caveat  with  the  above  analysis  is  that  there  are  too  few  firms  that  are  simultaneously 
listed  on  stock  market  and  small,  so  comparison  between  public  versus  closed  small  firms  lacks 
robustness.  Otherwise,  results  here  are  in  line  with  those  obtained  when  we  interact  size  and  export 
capacity, what give us more confidence that the influence of both being listed on stock markets and 
export  capacity  are  beyond  any  possible  correlation  with  size:  while  in  general  no-large  firms  are 
credit-constrained,  this  restriction  was  softened  for  firms  in  this  group  who  are  listed  on  the  stock 
market, or those who attained significant revenues from exports.

7. CONCLUSION 
 
In  this  paper,  we  evaluate  whether  Brazilian  firms  are  credit  constrained  and,  especially,  which 
conditions  prevail  for  the  existence  of  credit  restrictions.  Our  results  back  up  previous  studies  using 
Brazilian data, which say that they are credit restricted. Moreover, we found that Brazilian firms’ cash 
flow  to  investment  elasticity  is  on  average  5  times  larger  than  British  firms’  elasticity,  suggesting  a 
greater degree of constraints in Brazilian credit market.8  Despite confirming what has been previously 
investigated, we found that firms not listed on the stock market are credit constraint yet those listed are 
not. Terra (2003) and Aldrighi and Bisinha (2010) found that firms listed on the stock market are credit 
constrained.  

Regarding  results  on  firms’  size,  our  findings  go  on  the  usual  direction  of  international  literature, 
where credit constraints are softened for larger firms, while in Aldrighi and Bisinha (2010) prevail the 
opposite result and Terra (2003) can only replicate a result similar to ours in a limited period of years 
in  her  sample.  In  addition,  we  find  that  companies  more  devoted  to  exports,  measured  as  the  ratio 
exports/sales,  are  not  credit  constrained,  whereas  firms  that  export  below  the  median  are  credit 
restricted. Our results are valid, indeed, when one considers the size’s bias. That is to say, even small 
companies  that  are  public  or  high  exporters  do  not  experience  credit  restrictions,  accordingly  to  our 
outcomes. 

Yet,  it  is  important  to  note  that  not  only  does  the  period  of  time  are  quite  different  but  also  the 
composition of firms covered by those studies, and we should also note that the latter authors ignore 
some important methodological issues which are acknowledged in this paper, such as endogeneity and 
sector opportunities investments controls. 

Our findings in this paper may also have some valuable policy implications. First, we have noticed 
that credit restriction occurs with firms generating resources around their capital stock level, in other 
words, when ratio of cash flow over capital is close to one. Having those results in mind, this might be 
an indication on which firm is restricted to invest, since they are already investing all they can with 
their own resources. Thus, if this ratio is close to one, those firms might be target for public policy. 
However,  other  criteria  are  also  relevant  for  public  policy  design.  For  instance,  investment  in 
intangible  assets  was  not  considered  in  this  investigation,  and  therefore  some  apparently  non-credit 
restricted firms might depend on internal funds to invest in innovation. Thus, we can´t use our measure 
of  credit  restriction  as  the  only  criteria  for  public  policy  design,  and  some  other  targets  for  public 
funding must be elected, as exemplified by the current focus of BNDES in innovation.  

Second, in a developing country like Brazil, where capital is scarce and long term credit is usually 
provided  by  state-owned  banks,  availability  of  other  sources  of  funds  are  vital  for  accelerating 
economic  growth.  If  we  understand  the  stock  market  as  an  “inside”  source  of  funds  for  firms  in  a 
country and export capacity as a proxy for “outside” source of funds, once export revenue may be seen 
as a collateral to get access to international financing, our results suggest that both were valuable for 
mitigating credit restrictions in Brazilian firms.  

Of course, what our methodology strictly permits to investigate is a comparison of the levels of credit 
constraints among firms with certain characteristics (size, listed or not on the Brazilian stock markets 
and export capacity), and some hidden factors may determine both the degree of credit constraints and 
these characteristics. But, at the same time, our results show that the categories mentioned systematic 
reduce credit constraints for Brazilian firms, even after controlling for a series of observable variables 
that may impact the investment decision, reinforcing our suspicion that there is indeed a casual effect. 
Whether  this  is  the  case,  we  can  propose  that  government  efforts  should  be  made,  for  instance,  to 
develop  the  stock  market  (or  to  help  firms  to  achieve  the  standards  required  to  go  public)    and  to

stimulate  exports,  in  this  way  contributing  to  alleviate  credit  constraints  of  domestics  firms  and 
sponsoring  their  investments.  It  is  indeed  what  BNDES  does  by  its  subsidiaries:  BNDESPAR;  and 
BNDES-Exim. In the former, BNDES offers support for firms aiming to offer their shares in the stock 
market, while export support is offered by the latter. At the same time, support from BNDES must not 
be restricted to these kind of programs, and indeed large and well established exporting and already 
listed firms should receive financing, for instance for projects  generating positive externalities in the 
economy. 

In sum, it is feasible to emphasize that there is room for public policy implications considering our 
credit  restriction  results.  BNDES  is  aware  of  this  market  failure  and  its  operational  policy  proposes 
different types of support to overcome this shortcoming. Moreover, actual world economic situation, 
after the economic crisis initiated in 2008, presents even more challenging scenarios for governments 
to address this market failure. Certainty is the importance of governments to mitigate credit restriction 
for private firms.
