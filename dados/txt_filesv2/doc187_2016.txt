The likelihood of a water market in Brazil

June 29, 2016

Abstract: The paper examines the likelihood of a water market in Brazil. The US water
market, probably the oldest and most well-documented case, is initially analyzed. In the Amer-
ican West, water permits were transformed into property rights more than 140 years ago. How-
ever, mainly due to high transaction costs, only recently the trading became regular. Analyzing
the Brazilian case, it is clear that the country does not have the problem of water availability
that the American West has. On the other hand, Brazil has poor water infrastructure. As such,
more than 35% of cities had no water for months in 2012, although the country possesses 12%
of the world’s fresh water. To implement a water market, the ﬁrst step would be to change the
water diversion entitlements in keeping with the property rights. It is argued that this would be
an opportunity to force users to invest in water infrastructure. Thus, a model is built to study the
conditions under which the market would lead to a Pareto superior situation. Keywords: water
right, water market, Brazilian water law.

Resumo: O artigo examina os indicativos de um mercado de água no Brasil. O caso dos
EUA, provavelmente o mais antigo e bem documentado, é inicialmente analisado. No Oeste
Americano, as outorgas foram transformadas em direitos de propriedade há mais de 140 anos.
Todavia, devido principalmente aos altos custos de transação, apenas recentemente o comércio
se tornou regular. Analisando caso do Brasil, ﬁca evidente que o país não tem um problema
de disponibilidade hídrica como tem o Oeste Americano. Por outro lado, o Brasil tem uma
pobre infraestrutura hídrica, de modo que mais de 35% das cidades tiveram falta de água por
meses em 2012, embora o país tenha 12% da água mundial. Para iniciar um mercado, primeiro
seria necessário transformar as outorgas em direitos de propriedade. Argumenta-se que isso
seria uma oportunidade para forçar os usuários a investir em infraestruturas hídrica. Assim, um
modelo é construído para estudar as condições em que o mercado levaria a uma situação Pareto
superior. Palavras-chave: outorga de direito de uso de recurso hídrico, mercado de água, lei

Introduction

In 1997, Brazil established a national plan to manage water resources with three main ele-
ments1: water diversion entitlements (“outorgas de direito de uso de recurso hídrico,” in Por-
tuguese), contributions and basin committees. Under this approach, the water users need per-
mits from the government, and they must contribute ﬁnancially to watershed preservation. The
aim of the basin committees is to monitor the permits, establish the contributions, and invest in
water conservation.

In 2015, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published
an evaluation of the Brazilian plan. The report indicates that the users rarely contribute ﬁnan-
cially, as outlined by the law. In fact, only 4 in 174 committees had implemented the policy
by 2012 (ANA, 2013), mainly because there is much resistance from users against the contri-
butions. In conclusion, the report suggests that the diversion entitlements could be converted
to tradable property rights, and the taxation on trading could ﬁnance watersheds maintenance.
According media reports, the Brazilian Water National Agency (ANA) is considering this pos-
sibility in response to the water crisis2. Although this is not a new discussion in Brazil; a law
project with this purpose was debated between 2002 and 2013 in the National Congress.

The establishment of ﬁnancial contributions and primitive markets for water diversion enti-
tlements, often called “water rights,” has been promoted since Roman times. Scott and Coustalin
(1995) show that the idea came up several times throughout history, motivated by many differ-
ent causes, but always as to balance different uses in dry times and in arid places. Today water
markets in some form exist in the United States (US), Mexico, Australia, South Africa, Chile,
India, China, Israel, Portugal, and Spain.

Among these countries, the US case is probably the oldest and best documented. According
Anderson and Hill (1975) and Littleﬁeld (1983), the modern idea of tradable water permits
started in the 1850s with the California gold rush, where river fractions were allotted by the
miners themselves by date of ﬁrst use, giving them an early form of the water rights. At the
end of the gold rush period, farmers started buying these water rights, and during the following
years they started a primitive marketplace among the settlers. During the 20th Century, activity
in this market was reduced by the popularization of groundwater exploitation as a substitute
source. However, in the later years, it has restarted because there are not more options to supply
water in the American West – water availability is being redistributed by the market.

The literature in economics began to take a special interest in this issue in the 1980s. There
seems to be a consensus that the market is a good way to force the efﬁcient water use under a
scarcity situation, provided that there are ways to reduce transaction costs and negative exter-
nalities3. In this sense of scarcity, the data show that Brazil has a “functional” lack of water,
i.e., the country has a considerable lack of water infrastructure and does not have an issue of
availability. In fact, Brazil has 12% of the world’s fresh water, but more than 35% of the cities
lacked water in 2012 because there were not ways to adequately management the watersheds
(OECD, 2015).

Given the likelihood of a water market in Brazil, or at least a more frequent discussion of the
idea, this paper has two purposes. First, it produces a literature review to contribute to a clearer

debate about this issue. It points out what has been learned about the historical development of
water rights, the formation of a marketplace, and the situations in which it has become beneﬁcial
to society. Second, this article analyzes at what point the conversion of permits to water rights
(i.e., tradable property rights) can be an opportunity to solve water problems in Brazil – for this,
an economic model is developed to study how the market would lead to a “Pareto superior”
situation.

In this way, the second section presents water market development and current data, with
special attention to the US case. Section 3 discusses the hydric situation, the imminence of the
water market and the distribution possibilities of water rights in Brazil. Final remarks conclude
the paper.

2 The US water market

Gleick (1993) describes many conﬂicts related to droughts, and the reason for this is quite
simple: water is a fundamental resource, integral to all ecological and societal activities, in-
cluding food and energy production, transportation, waste disposal, industrial development,
and human health. In any inhabited place where water becomes scarce for a long time, some
kind of human conﬂict emerges. Among these quarrels exists a special case in the US during
the second half of 19th Century. It is emblematic because from it comes up with the idea of
water rights as property rights separate from land rights (Anderson and Hill, 1975; Littleﬁeld,
1983; Scott and Coustalin, 1995). This section ﬁrst presents this history, and later some data of
the market that has emerged from it.

2.1 The history

The 1848 California discovery of gold caused a massive immigration movement to the
American West (what is today the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana,
Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming). Besides mining,
many economic activities suddenly emerged, especially those related to agriculture to provide
food. As most of the territory is semi-arid, and water is an essential input for mining and
agriculture, the conﬂicts among users were inevitable.

While the state presence was growing, a court system was installed. At that time the notion
Its main principle
of justice in relation to water was the “riparian doctrine” of British law.
was that the land ownership gives the right to use the water inside and adjacent of property.
However, with few water endowments in a vast territory, poorly deﬁned property rights and
conﬂicts emerging everywhere, this principle did not make sense – and a new doctrine was
needed to establish order.

In 1855, the California Supreme Court judged a case known as Irwin v. Phillips that became
a turning point for water laws. Irwin’s mining was exploiting a creek while Phillips started
another mining operation downstream. Eventually there was not sufﬁcient water for both, and
neither had land rights. After much debate, the court ruled “ﬁrst in time, ﬁrst in right” and that
the rights over water and land can be separated. As such, Irwin gained the water-use priority,
even without having the land rights. This was the ﬁrst principle of the “priority doctrine” that
would be established in the following years.

During the 1860s, mining was in a decline, and farmers were claiming the water that had
been used in now-abandoned mines. So, the courts began deciding which water uses were

3

more important to communities. This was called the “beneﬁcial use” principle, and it helped to
prioritize water use. But, often ditches were needed to divert water from mining points to farms,
frequently complicating land uses (i.e., creating negative externalities). So, the water right
transfers were conditioned with the presentation of a plan for ditches as well as neighbourhood
agreements – this was called the “third-party” principle. From these three principles (ﬁrst in
time, beneﬁcial use, and third-party), the modern water rights concept was born. However, the
idea of a market had not yet emerged.

In the 1870s, with the end of the civil war, a new massive immigration movement to the
American West had begun, and these new settlers needed access to water. In this way, the gov-
ernment gave the water rights to news users under the three principles of the priority doctrine.
These entitlements recorded the source and way of diverting water, authorized use, and priority
number in case of shortages (older users ﬁrst). But the key point of these papers was that water
rights were considered property rights, so they could be sold, leased or exchanged. At this time,
the possibility of a marketplace was born.

Since the end of the 19th Century, new users were required to apply for a new right from
a government agency or look for an existing right in the marketplace, both of which were
challenges. If a new user was applying for a new right, the law required that existing users
not be negatively affected, which was a difﬁcult condition to meet. And in the marketplace,
besides being rare to ﬁnd a seller and set a fair price, there could be a high transaction cost to
properly divert the water from properties. But these challenges had begun to be less important
with the proliferation of water wells – because they were free of water rights.
In this way,
the substitution between surface water and groundwater stopped market development for many
years.

In the ﬁrst half of 20th Century, a countless number of water wells began operating through-
out the American West, while water shortage problems began to worsen in rivers and creeks.
With the development of geological sciences, it was possible to show that the groundwater ex-
ploitation was drying the surface sources because the aquifers were partially recharged by the
inﬁltration of surface water. But the worst discovery was that these aquifers were ﬁlled over
geologic time, and they could not be fully recharged by the hydrological cycle. These sources
were as exhaustible as oil reserves4

Gopalakrishnan (1973), Garner (1997), and Hobbs (1999) show the perception that it was
only a matter of time before the “water chaos” forced sweeping changes to laws during the
1960s. By the mid-1970s, all US western states had developed speciﬁc rules for groundwater
use, and this forced a revision of all water rights. To illustrate the issue, Table 1 shows the
number of permits and population in Colorado by decades. By the middle of 20th Century,
there were close to 20,000 water rights awarded with a population of nearly 1.5 million. In other
words, there were almost 14 rate permits per thousand people. Under the new law, more than
55,000 wells with speciﬁc water rights were recorded and monitored in the 1970s, increasing
the rate to 35 per thousand people.5

4In addition, Burness and Quirk (1979, 1980) and Saleth et al. (1991) have investigated theoretically and empir-
ically the effects of the “ﬁrst in time, ﬁrst in use” principle in regards to water management. They found indications
that this principle has not encouraged investment in infrastructure because the users with greater economic power
could buy the priority rights rather than making new investments. So, the presence of this principle would aggravate
the problem of shortages.

5In the Colorado case, virtually all permits awarded after the 1980s are related to the drilling of small wells. In
other words, new surface water permits were rarely awarded. Nowadays, all catchment systems above 15 gallons
(56.8 liters) per minute must to be supported by a water right (regardless of the source), being that 86.5% of the
rights are used for agriculture, 6.8% are used for industrial and mining purposes, and the remaining 6.7% are for
municipal use, which is the treatment and distribution of water for residences and business.

Howe et al. (1986), Lyon (1986), Swaney (1988), and Shupe et al. (1989) report that the
new laws created difﬁculties for a groundwater market, but also created new possibilities to
incentivize the development of surface water markets with the purpose of reallocating water
availability between agents with bigger marginal values of use. The main idea possibly is
the “water bank” – it can be broadly deﬁned as an institutional mechanism that facilitates the
transfer and market exchange of various types of surface and storage entitlements. In effect, the
bank can act as an intermediary that brings together buyers and sellers. In addition, this ﬁgure
can provide a host of administrative and technical functions to reduce transactions costs. For
example, it can implement a derivative market where farmers have an option to buy or sell water
in case of a future drought, or it can implement an auction system for storage volumes.

Even with the new institutional framework developed over the 1970s, Howe (1998), Howe
(2005), and Whitford and Clark (2007) show that the water markets worked poorly at least
until the 1990s – only some isolated business occurred.
In most cases, the reason was that
the transaction costs remained high and inﬂexible. Besides the engineering problems (piping,
pumping, evaporation, contamination etc.), there was also: the difﬁculty of ﬁnding buyers and
sellers close enough to transfer water; the speculative movements frequently hampering price
negotiation; and, the possibility that a neighbour would create a judicial problem.

As described by Donohew (2009), in all western states in order to change aspects of a water
right (the owner, point of diversion, type of use etc.) a government agency needs to approve
it. In most states, the applicant has to hire a certiﬁed examiner to study the case and report
it to the agency. The agency must then determine if the change will negatively affect wildlife
and other users. Furthermore, a public announcement of the proposed trade is made, usually
in a newspaper, and a comment period is opened to allow the public to raise objections to the
transfer. If the transfer is protested, a hearing is held by a water court and both sides present
their cases. If there is potential harm, the agency accepts or denies the application, or may
attach conditions, such as a reduction in the total water transferred. And, by law, the potential
buyer or leaseholder pays all costs – which discourages a lot of trading.

On the other hand, Howe and Goemans (2003) and Lepper and Freeman (2010) also show
examples between the 1990s and 2000s where the marketplace worked well. Speciﬁcally, this
happened where there is an institution, like a water bank, that provided: low transaction costs
(efﬁcient administrative and engineering procedures); access to information (databases to ﬁnd
buyers, sellers and prices); and, sufﬁcient market scope (some concentration to create a range of
transactions). The reference market in this sense is the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy
District (NCWCD), where a public agency administrates the water distribution and acts as a
water bank, using 12 reservoirs and more than 200 km of tunnels and canals. The system pro-
vides supplementary water for more than 260,000 hectares of irrigated agriculture and 900,000
people.6

Analyzing the most recent years, Donohew (2009), Iseman et al. (2012), and Culp et al.
(2014) report examples of other places that are trying to operate like the NCWCD. This stems
from the fact that historically many projects were developed in the American West to augment
water supplies by building dams, reservoirs and canals to capture, store and transmit water.
But nowadays, most areas in the water basins have been claimed, and environmental objections
to new projects further reduce supply growth as a feasible way to meet increasing demand.
Consequently, meeting the needs of new users via new sources has been largely replaced by the
reallocation of existing supplies using the water markets.7

Furthermore, irrigators consume more than 80% of the fresh water in the American West,
frequently for the production of low-valued crops such as hay and alfalfa (Brewer et al., 2008).
Urban uses and high-valued crops have far greater marginal water values. Therefore, a combi-
nation of scarcity and application in low-valued production are creating a new opportunity for
markets to reallocate water to higher valued uses. As will be seen below, as in the past when
water rights were moved from mining to agriculture, today they are going from agriculture to
urban uses.

2.2 The contemporaries data

The best source of information about water markets in the US is the “Journal of Water”,
because it produces a regular survey of the transactions in the state agencies8. However, even
this dataset underestimates the reality in at least two ways (Hansen et al., 2014). First, there
are informal leases that are not included in its surveys. And second, frequently the transactions
recorded do not have all data disclosed by the agencies, such as prices, because the disclosure
depends on state laws. Despite this, the University of California, Santa Barbara provides a
comprehensive compilation of these surveys between 1987 and 2009.9

As Table 2 displays, there were at least 4,608 transactions over 23 years observed in the
American West, and they moved more than 43 billion m3 in assets – as a point of reference,
in Brazil the maximum volume of the Cantareira System in São Paulo is close to 1 billion
m3. Colorado had almost half of the transactions due to the operations in the NCWCD, and
California had the greatest volumes traded10. Table 2 shows also the populations11, pointing

8See journalofwater.com.
9See bren.ucsb.edu.
10Hansen et al. (2008) provide an empirical analysis of this case.
11The number of water rights awarded is not publicly available in all states. In Colorado and Oregon there were
129,355 and 88,379 rights, respectively, in 2015. Comparing these numbers with the populations, it is possible to

6

that even in relative terms Colorado has the most transactions (443 per million inhabitants) –
which corroborates with the idea presented earlier that the ﬁgure of a water bank is fundamental
to increase the trading by reducing the transaction costs.12

Also in Table 2, note that despite the fact that Colorado has had more transfers, the assets
have relatively had less volume. This reﬂects the fact that in Colorado most of the transfers are
among irrigation farms, while in Arizona, California and Idaho, for example, most transfers are
from agriculture to municipalities – with the purpose of protecting the cities from lacking water
(Brookshire et al., 2004).

Table 3 shows the origins and destinations of the transfers considering agriculture zones,
urban areas, and the environment (Donohew, 2009). The numbers show that 16.4% of the
transfers have had origin and destinations inside the agriculture zones. Moreover, 82.9% of all
transfers originated in this sector, and the main destinations were the urban areas, followed by
the environment (basically the recharge of degraded watersheds). This reﬂects the fact that the
irrigators have the highest number of water rights in the American West. On the other hand, as it
was discussed earlier, urban users have greater marginal values for water, thus they are looking
for farmers to try reallocating resources. This movement involves a lot of money too – despite
less than 2/3 of the observations having values recorded in the dataset, the total was more than
5.6 billion of dollars.

estimate that there are around 25 rights per 1,000 inhabitants in the American West. In these terms, there would be
more than 2 million rights in this region, and the trading of 4,608 rights could be less than 0.5% of the total.

12Payne et al. (2014) provide an empirical analysis for this point in the Colorado case.

Ahead Figure 1(a) shows that the transactions have had an ascending trend during the period
analyzed, and that the leases’ operations have had as much presence as sales13. This ascending
trend can be justiﬁed by the drought risk. To illustrate the situation, Figure 1(b) is showing
the supply and demand in the Colorado River Basin system between the 1920s and 2000s – the
basin provides approximately 42% of the fresh water in the American West. While the supply
historically offered by the hydrological cycle is around 18 billion m3 per year14, the average
demand for water in the basin has exceeded this level every year since 2003. This is forcing the
users to get water from other systems, using the marketplace as a solution (Culp et al., 2014;
Iseman et al., 2012; Pullen and Colby, 2008).

In short, the marketplace in the US has been asleep for almost 100 years (between the 1890s
and the 1990s), but the lack of new water resources and an increasing demand are waking
it up. Moreover, the data corroborate that in a situation of shortage, the market for water-
access entitlements can be a tool of reallocation to sectors with larger marginal values of use if
transaction costs are low enough, which depends on the available infrastructure and legislation.

13In addition to these operations, there were also exchanges (not plotted) representing less than 5% of transac-

tions.

14The supply concept is of the “hydric availability”.

shortages is becoming more popular. However, there is not a common model; each country
is working with its own arrangements and different motivations15. But even in the US, which
apparently has the oldest and most experience with water markets, what is to come is not very
clear. The market still is very immature, and nobody seems to predict with some certainty how
this marketplace will be throughout the 21st Century.

3 The likelihood of a water market in Brazil

OECD (2015) presents a detailed evaluation of the contemporary Brazilian water gover-
nance16. Among its many contributions, the report summarizes the literature that describes the
basin committees’ difﬁculties introducing the users’ contributions system, as set by law in 1997.
Consequently, there are few ﬁnancial resources to improve water management.17

The report also describes the government’s advances in controlling access to hydric re-
sources by emission and supervision of water diversion entitlements. However, this control is
still too weak to enforce an efﬁcient allocation and utilization among the users. According ANA
(2013), there were 204,607 permits recorded in 2012 in Brazil, which is not signiﬁcant for a
country with more than 200 million people. To compare, in Colorado, a state with 5 million
residents, there were 129,355 permits recorded in the same year.

In short, OECD (2015) pointed that there is ample resistance from the system of contribu-
tions, many challenges in the controlling and planning of the use of watersheds, and signiﬁcant
issues related to the lack of infrastructure and management of water availability. In conclu-
sion, the report suggests that the transformation of permits into water rights (i.e., entitlements
with tradable property rights) could be a complementary tool for governance, and perhaps even
replace an ineffective system of contributions.

The OECD proposal is in line with the law project #6979/2002 that was under discussion
in the National Congress until 2013. In this project, the general idea was that a market could
reallocate water between users during droughts or in the Brazilian semi-arid, and a percentage of
traded value could increase the contributions to the watersheds’ management. Moreover, insofar
as the market maturing, possibly there would be greater interest on behalf of the economic
agents to fund large storage and distribution infrastructures.

But regardless of the proposals, looking at the US case, it has been evident that the birth of
a water market is determined fundamentally by four variables: water scarcity, heterogeneity in
water endowments, different values of use, and transaction costs. In the absence of a threshold
of these magnitudes, it may not make much sense to talk about a market. Thus, to analyze the
likelihood of a marketplace in Brazil, these points will be considered in sequence.

3.1 The Brazilian hydric availability

As OECD (2015) points out, Brazil has 12% of the world’s “hydric availability,” i.e., the
amount of water that can be removed from watersheds without substantially altering the hydro-
logic cycle and the opportunities for future use. But this fact does not imply that the country
is operationally abundant in water, because the abundance does not mean much without the
existence of ways to exploit it.18

To illustrate that it is not easy to exploit this abundance, Figure 2 shows the spatial dis-
tribution of the hydric availability and of the urban consumption19. The left map shows that
86.4% of Brazilian water is in the Amazonic hydrographic region (the darker area), 7.9% is
in the hydrographic regions of Paraguai and Paraná (the less dark area), and the rest is spread
throughout the area closer to the coast20. On the other hand, Figure 2(b) shows that the urban
consumption is on the opposite side of the country – thousands of km away from the Amazon
region. The maps are like an inverse mirror of each other, and it can be concluded that almost
all urban needs must rely solely on 13.6% of available water there.

(b) Urban consumption.

But, even without considering the Amazon region, the data indicate that Brazil still will
have water availability, though not necessarily water access. Table 4 displays the water use by
sectors to illustrate the distance from a chronic problem. According the ANA surveys in 2006
and 2010, the total consumption increased from 54.1 to 72.3 billion m3 between these years.
In terms of water availability, the numbers indicate that was used 14.5 and 19.4% of the limit

18See The Economist, April 26, 2014, “Water in Brazil: Nor any drop to drink.”
19To be consistent with the data shown for the US case, the sum of urban and industrial uses recorded in ANA

(2013) are considered urban consumption.

20Some readers may be surprised that the area of the São Francisco River is not darker in color, but it must be
remembered that the map is showing water availability, and that this basin was at the limit of its use capacity in the
recent years.

To compare, as Figure 1(b) displayed previously,
the majority of the American West is above 100% in this indicator. Consequently, even without
counting the Amazon region, there is a good water supply, although there is an indication of
increasing consumption.

As can be seen too in Table 4, the agricultural use increased from 31.6 in 2006 to 44.5 billion
m3 in 2010 – meaning an increase of 40.8%, while the increase in the urban use was 23.5%.
This indicates that agriculture is signiﬁcantly increasing water consumption, and there are at
least two explanations for it (ANA, 2013). First, besides being a larger water user by nature,
the sector is performing economically better than urban sectors in recent years. And second,
irrigation activities are growing faster than other agricultural activities.

However, despite the water availability in Brazil, drought problems are frequent. Table 5
shows more than 10% of the municipalities of the country frequently have intense or moderate
scarcity problems. And, more than 35 percent of the cities lacked water in 2012.

At any rate, as pointed out by OECD (2015), the fact is that there are not water problems due
to a widespread drought, like in the case of the American West. The water problems in Brazil
are more connected to a lack of infrastructure. And under the imminence of water market
implementation, a more basic issue must be pointed out: the permits need to be transformed
on tradable rights. In this way, this transformation can be explored like an opportunity, and a
mechanism for the distribution of water rights can be useful in aligning incentives and to take
advantage of water availability. This is addressed in sequence.

3.2 An economic model to analyze incentives and transaction costs

To better understand when the market can be a solution for water problems (and when it
cannot), a simple model is developed here. In this way, as Figure 3 describes, nature might re-
veal a “normal time” (i.e., water availability at least equal to the sum of volumes in all permits),
or a “dry time” – when the government needs to reduce the volumes of all the water diversion
entitlements (e.g., in a river).

In this scenario, each user indexed by i has a permit to divert wi with no cost. More-
over, during a normal time, each user could invest in some infrastructures for storage ωi at the
marginal cost c (including all engineering and transaction perspectives). The government wants
to enforce all possible hydric infrastructures to use in dry times, and the maximum ωi that each
user can offer is supposed to be known21. For that reason, the government is analyzing an “if
invest you may trade” rule – i.e., if the user invests to reach ωi, he will have the right to trade
water. Therefore, in this model the water rights are granted for the users that built water storage
infrastructures determinate by the government.
i for any volume ai ≥ 0, with α > 0. Then each user
has two options: “invest,” which gives him a payoff Vi = (wi + ωi + xi)α − pxi − cωi, where p is

the market price and xi is the choice of water fraction to trade (if xi > 0 he chooses to buy, and
if xi < 0 he chooses to sell); or “no invest,” which gives him a payoff vi = wα

the value of use only of the permit. The price and potential volumes traded are determined by a
static game of complete information among the users, then the strategies are: “invest” and trade

Nash equilibrium implies in a Pareto superior situation). To identify the determinants of this
situation, conveniently the permits can be written as deviations of the average hydric available
to trade: wi = qiw, for any qi ≥ 0. Then U

water value is different between users because the permits are not equal, and it implies that trade
in a pure exchange economy puts the users in a Pareto superior situation – a known result by
economic theory in the absence of market failures. Complementary, the potential proﬁt of the
water production is positive ever the market price is larger than the marginal cost involving the

i > 0 occurs even if the proﬁt is negative, provided that it is smaller
(in absolute value) than the pure exchange economy outcome. Putting this together, Figure 4
illustrates all net payoffs possible in the Nash equilibrium.

reﬂected by the solid line in the right graph, that is plotting U

price and marginal costs are equal, or in a pure exchange economy situation). If the user permit
is smaller than the average hydric availability (i.e., 0 ≤ qi < 1), he desires to buy water because
he has a bigger marginal value of use. On the other hand, if qi > 1 he desires to sell because he

Considering the US case, where it is well documented that the transaction costs are high
< c and ωi (cid:44) 0
and there are a lot of investments in infrastructure, the possibilities where p
seem to be closer to the reality. The point is that if the user has very little water (qi → 0),
the marginal beneﬁt to have more water is very high. Consequently, some ﬁnancial loss in the
present investment is acceptable to get beneﬁts in a potentially future dry, if this loss is not
∗ − c)ωi > 0 needs to happen
greater than a threshold – in the model, the result (1− α)wα + (p
(i.e., the pure exchange economy outcome when qi = 1 needs to be bigger than the potential loss
of the investment in infrastructure). On the other hand, if the user has much water (qi → +∞),
the market is an even better result for him – because he can sell the excess volume.23
In short, in the model developed here there are four points (not mutually exclusive) involving
a Pareto superior scenario. First, a shortage situation needs to exist to adjust the permits wi
and/or motivate the offer of supplementary water ωi. Second, this situation needs to create
some heterogeneity in the endowments – i.e., qi (cid:44) 1. Third, the marginal beneﬁts for water
use needs to be different between users – in the model, α < 1 permits this. Finally, there is a
threshold when the absence of proﬁt in the production of supplementary water precludes the
market – i.e., p

∗ can be smaller than c until a limit.

In its simplicity, the model developed here can explain some facts observed in the US case,
as the prevalence of market operations at the same time where there are high transaction costs.

23The numbers of this movement trade were discussed previously for the US case in the analysis of Table 3.

14

In addition, the model is also potentially useful for a deeper discussion about the possibility of
the implementation of a water market in Brazil. And thus, it may also be useful as a basis for
the development of other economic models that include aspects closer to reality.

The model can be expanded in many ways. First, some dynamics can be included, and thus
can be considered a probability distribution of the risk of dry times in future – the game gains
an aspect of incomplete information. Second, ωi can be considered a private information of
players, where the government and other players have only partial information on how much
supplementary water each user can offer – the game gains an aspect of imperfect information.
Third, other types of infrastructure can be incorporated in addition to the storage capacity, such
as a system of channels that may reach different users or transport water of differing qualities
and evaporation levels. Fourth, other transaction costs and externalities may be incorporated
in the model, such as the judicial costs and other aspects discussed in Donohew (2009). Fifth,
it can imcorporate the simultaneity of the market and the system of contributions, as well as
the resistance from the users to exchange governance models as discussed in OECD (2015).
Sixth, bargaining rules may be implemented in the case that the Nash equilibrium is not Pareto
superior, but at the same time the social gain is large enough to implement the market – i.e., if
∗
i > 0, there is space to bargain the social beneﬁts

and implement the market.

i < 0 for some i = 1, ..., I < n and(cid:80)n

Regardless of the potential expansions, using the model in the simplest version, a forthcom-
ing example is developed to show how the transformation of permits into water rights can be
explored as an opportunity to take advantage of Brazilian hydric availability. Speciﬁcally, the
idea is to better understand how the government could deﬁne the levels ωi (which has hitherto
been considered exogenous). To do this, illustratively, a real case is considered.

3.3 The water bank example and the ω determination

To exemplify the possibility of aligning the incentives to have a better hydric infrastructure,
the case of the interconnection between the Paraíba do Sul river and the Cantareira system in
São Paulo is examined. It is a construction of 20 km, at cost of 140 million of dollars, funded by
the state government to mitigate future water crisis, that could be a water bank24. Downstream
there are about 1,100 users with permits to divert a total of almost 2 billion m3 per year, and
in the Cantareira side the SABESP25 is allowed to divert another billion. While the river ﬂow
is above the sum of the permits, the bank could be ﬁlled. In the future, during dry times, the
ﬂoodgates could be opened to supply water. So, this project could be funded by a private agent
(a water banker) in exchange for some kind of water rights. In this case, the law could give the
right for the banker encash these users for the water recharging services.

The potential banker could be a big economic player among the river users, such as the
CSN. This ﬁrm is the second largest steel-maker company in Brazil, and its permits represents
more than 12% of the total volume of diverts allowed in Paraíba do Sul. As such, this ﬁrm is
one of the most interested users in the functioning of a safe system to supply water, and it has
ways to fund the project.

24See Folha de São Paulo, Dec. 10, 2015, “SP, MG e RJ fecham acordo de gestão do rio Paraíba do Sul para

beneﬁciar Cantareira.”

25It is the largest utility company in the world by market capitalization, providing water and sewage services to
residential, commercial and industrial users in the city of São Paulo and in 363 of the 645 municipalities in São
Paulo state.

15

In this scenario, suppose that with certainty of a dry future occurs wi = 0 for all i – i.e.,
the river’s hydric availability is at its limit, and nobody can divert anything more. On the other
hand, consider that there is an user indexed by b (the banker) funding a infrastructure upstream
with capacity ω.

In the model terms, this situation implies ωb = ω and ωi = 0 for all i (cid:44) b. The banker
can open the ﬂoodgates to supply xi for each user i downstream diversions (including himself).
Moreover, it is considered that all users are honest – i.e., nobody diverts if he does not pay,
and when somebody diverts the volume is exactly equal to what it is paid. In this case occurs:
∗
= α/(ω/n)1−α. Since qi = 0 for all i,
i = w = ω/n for all i (cid:44) b; x

including the banker, substituting this results in equation (1), the net payoffs are:

With these net payoffs, if ω ≤ ([1+α(n−1)]/[cnα])1/(1−α), the government can enforce any

limit in ω is illustrated in the left graph of Figure 5). To choose ω, the government can use a

4 Final remarks

This paper has been analyzing the likelihood of a water market in Brazil, accordingly with
what the media has published in recent months. As this issue is still an uncommon discussion in
economic literature of Brazil, this analysis has started by looking at the history of these markets
– in particular the US market, which is potentially the oldest and most well-documented case.
In the American West, water access entitlements were transformed into property rights more
than 140 years ago, and they are known today as “water rights”. Despite the water rights trading
be possible for many years, a marketplace began to operate regularly just a few years ago,
because the transaction costs are too high. In fact, the increased water demand and the non-
existence of new sources are becoming the market a feasible option to allocate endowments.

Analyzing the Brazilian data, it is easily noted that the country does not have a water avail-
ability problem – as is the case in the American West. On the other hand, Brazil has a con-
siderable lack of infrastructure to store and distribute water. Hence that a fact with no sense is
regularly observed: the country has 12% of the world’s fresh water, while more than 10% of the
cities frequently lack water.

To implement a water market, the ﬁrst step is to change permits to divert water within one’s
water rights. In this paper, it was argued that this can be an opportunity to align the incentives
of economic agents to build new water infrastructures. Using an economic model, it was shown
that a game can be implemented to put society in a Pareto superior situation. This outcome
intrinsically depends on the transaction costs, expected water availability in the future, and
different marginal beneﬁts of water use among players.

Lastly, this research observed that water markets are increasing all around the world, and
this is a relatively new research agenda in many countries. But even in the US, which has the
most experience in this type of trading, the market is still very immature. There are few data to
analyze, and many challenges wanting answers from economy theory.
