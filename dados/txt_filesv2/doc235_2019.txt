Abstract

This paper estimates the payroll tax exemption effects by two alternative approaches. First, a Quasi-
experiment–based on Scherer (2015)–which takes into account the fact that ﬁrms under the tax regime
called simples already do not pay payroll taxes to deﬁne such group of ﬁrms as control. In order to
increase treatment and control groups similarities, at ﬁrst only ﬁrms with less than 50 employees were
considered. Even though such procedure leads to control and treatment groups with similar trends and to
signiﬁcant estimated coefﬁcients, regressions with the whole sample and with only ﬁrms with 30 to 50
workers suggest that these identiﬁcation strategy lacks external validity, i. e. results are valid only for
small ﬁrms. The other approach used was a structural model–based on Petrin and Sivadasan (2013)–which
considers payroll tax as a source of market imperfection, whose effects can be estimated from production
function coefﬁcients. Such market imperfections estimates were reduced in a range between 5% and 20%
to simulate policy effects. This procedure lead to results which also suggest that Quasi-Experimental
methodology used overestimates policy effects and the conclusion is that this policy had reduced effects.

Resumo

Este artigo estima os efeitos da política de desoneração da folha de pagamentos de duas maneiras.
Primeiro, em um quase-experimento–baseado em Scherer (2015)–que leva em conta o fato de que as
ﬁrmas que fazem parte do regime de tributação simples já não pagam este imposto e que, por isso, este
grupo de ﬁrmas pode ser tratado como o grupo de controle. Para aumentar a similaridade entre os grupos
de tratamento e de controle, inicialmente foi considerada uma amostra somente com ﬁrmas com menos
de 50 funcionários. Embora este procedimento tenha gerado grupos de tratamento e de controle com
características similares, as regressões com toda a amostra e considerando somente ﬁrmas com 30 a 50
funcionários sugerem que os resultados obtidos por meio dessa estratégia de identiﬁcação não possuem
validade externa, isto é, os resultados estimados são válidos somente para ﬁrmas pequenas. A outra
abordagem usada foi um modelo estrutural–baseado em Petrin and Sivadasan (2013)–que considera o
imposto sobre a folha de pagamentos como uma distorção no mercado de trabalho cujos efeitos podem ser
estimados por meio dos coeﬁcientes da função de produção. Tais estimativas de imperfeição de mercado
foram então reduzidas entre 5% e 20% para simular os efeitos da política. Os resultados obtidos também
sugerem que os resultados obtidos por meio do quase-experimento sobrestimam os efeitos da política,
levando a conclusão de que a política teve resultados reduzidos.

1 Introduction

There has been an intense discussion about the best approach to evaluate public policies; some authors
such as Angrist and Pischke (2010) announced the beginnings of a "Credibility Revolution in Economics",
based on Quasi-Experimental or Randomized Control Trials (RCTs), which are already widespread in
medical sciences. Even though RCTs have their merits, not all public policies are amenable to be evaluated
using such techniques. Nevo and Whinston (2010) pointed out that in Empirical Industrial Organization
sometimes the focus is on "external validity", and a structural model would be a more fruitful approach.

Such discussion is especially useful in analysis of policies like the payroll tax exemption for Brazilian
industries, which will be the subject of the present paper. The policy changed the payroll tax payment by a
tax charged on company sales, leading to a decrease in the ﬁrms’ total tax bill.

The payroll tax exemption was enacted in the beginning of 2012 by changes in labor tax law, which
beneﬁted four industries at ﬁrst. From 2012 to 2014, another ﬁve changes in the labor tax laws increased the
number of beneﬁted industries to forty-ﬁve. In 2015 it became optional for all beneﬁted industries and in
2017 the policy ended. However, payroll taxes further reduction or exemption are still discussed by policy
makers, which makes it important to understand the policy effects.

This program was large enough to have important effects on the funding of Brazilian Social Security
system. Some estimates from Brazilian Agency of Industrial Development (ABID)1 put the losses at about
20 billion BRL for the two ﬁrst years of the policy and at about 90 billion BRL from 2013 to 2017. These
large estimated costs coupled with the absence of any prior analysis of the program effectiveness make this
study especially relevant.

So far, three most relevant studies carry out a RCT analysis by using difference-in-difference methodol-
ogy: Dallava (2014), Scherer (2015) and Garcia et al. (2018). Even though those researchers use similar
methodologies, different identiﬁcation strategies lead to divergent results. While Scherer (2015) estimated
positive and signiﬁcant policy effects, Dallava (2014) and Garcia et al. (2018) found no signiﬁcant effects.
In this research, some of the RCT assumptions and results–especially those of Scherer (2015)–are
reviewed in the light of a structural model based on the methodology developed by Petrin and Sivadasan
(2013). The authors deﬁne the difference between the value of marginal product of a factor and its marginal
cost, which they call the gap, a distortion that moves the market from competitive equilibrium. Therefore, a
policy such as the payroll tax exemption can be analyzed as a decrease in the gap for the industrial labor
market equilibrium, and this decrease in market imperfections allows identiﬁcation of likely policy effects.
In what follows, section 2 describes the economic scenario that impelled the payroll tax exemption
implementation and presents the most important policy facts. In section 3, there is a brief discussion about
alternative policy evaluation methodologies and their relationship with this speciﬁc case. Section 3 also
presents the RCT strategy, market imperfection estimation methodology and the dataset used. Section 4
brieﬂy discusses the production function estimation, which is the ﬁrst and central step for market imperfection
estimation. Section 5 describes simulation procedures and presents the results. Section 6 concludes this
research.

2 Economic scenario and policy rationale

Concerns about Brazilian industry performance were widespread among policymakers for quite a few
years before 2012. Data from Applied Economic Research Institute (IPEA)2 shows that between 2000
and 2013 the industrial sector has grown less than the rest of the economy; while the whole economy has
grown 3.36% per year, –and agriculture and services have grown at 3.71% and 3.42% per year respectively–,
industrial sector has grown only 2.60% per year. This smaller growth rate resulted in the industrial share on
economy decreasing.

Brazilian Ministry of Industry, Foreign Trade and Services (MDIC) data3 shows that in 2014 the
manufacturing sector had its worst result on balance of trade, when imports have exceeded exports in
US$109 billion. In addition, according to the National Industries Confederation (CNI) data presented by
Werneck et al. (2012), the ratio of imports and consumption of manufactured goods in Brazilian economy
increased from 11.6% to 20.7% between 2000 and 2011, in current prices, and from 17.0% to 18.5% in
constant prices. According to Werneck et al. (2012), stagnation in industrial performance was one of
the most harmful problems in Brazilian economy, made worse by the macroeconomic scenario in past
years. The author argues the agricultural increasing exports overvalued Brazilian currency, stimulating
industrial goods imports and increasing the sector’s deﬁcits. Besides an overvalued currency, there were
also microeconomic distortions on Brazilian economy, just as in other Latin American countries. These
misallocations were so severe that, according to Busso et al. (2013), their elimination would increase
Latin America manufacturing productivity by a factor between 45% and 127% if eliminated. Lewis (2005)
considered the huge government’s participation on Brazilian economy–measured by high taxes– an important
reason for this reduced productivity. Similarly, Werneck et al. (2012) pointed out the share of taxes on
Brazilian GDP increased from 24% to 36% between 1990 and 2010. For Oliveira (2011), the literature
usually considers high social contributions and labor market rigidity as important sources of Brazilian
industry lack of competitiveness.

The effects of industrial policies such as changes in payroll tax policies are controversial, as pointed out
by the survey of Coronel et al. (2014): part of the literature is critical, because they generate imbalances;
other authors consider that such polices can reduce the damage caused by adverse economic scenarios and,
therefore, the government should protect industry using instruments such as credit expansion, subsides and
tax reductions. Drawing from this positive assessment of industrial policies, the payroll tax exemption
was enacted as a part of the "Programa Brasil Maior" (PBM), created to stimulate Brazilian industry
competitiveness.

The payroll tax exemption substitutes payroll tax for a sales tax, reducing in most cases the total tax
burden. The payroll tax change had three main objectives: reduce producer costs, increase employment and
increase the share of labor force formally employed. Therefore, this policy assumes high labor taxes reduce
Brazilian competitiveness in international markets, therefore reducing labor demand, exports, employment
and production.

Discussions on how best to increase formal employment in Brazil has been going since the mid-nineties,
with the acknowledgment of its effects on Social Security funding. In 1995, labor beneﬁts costs surpassed
tax revenues, which made this problem worse according to Neri (2003). Some authors, such as Neri (2003)
and Bordonaro (2003), considered a reduction in labor taxes as an way to increase the size of formal labor
market, and this kind of rationale led to two constitutional amendments, one in 1998 and other in 2003. The
most important policy acts related to payroll tax exemptions are presented in table 1.

These constitutional amendments changed the article 195 of the National Constitution, which regulates
ﬁnancing of Social Security System. The 1998 constitutional amendment allowed different tax collections
according to ﬁrms’ economic activity and to employment used in production. A constitutional amendment of
2003 allowed to substitute payroll tax collection by a sales revenue tax. In 2008, a constitutional amendment
project was discussed in Brazilian Congress, and lead to a series of changes in labor tax law, enacted from
2012 to 2014.

Sometimes the change had an opposite effect from what is expected, by increasing the total tax burden.
When ﬁrms had a small workers by revenue rate, the beneﬁt from labor tax reduction by shifting the tax
burden from labor to sales might be too small to compensate the increasing in tax charged on sales4 .
Even though these cases were discussed in Brazilian National Congress, the policy was mandatory at ﬁrst,
but in 2015, the Law 13.161/2015 made this tax system optional. In March of 2017, the constitutional
amendment 774/2017 ended this policy to manufacturing sector, maintaining the payroll tax exemption only

Estado de S.Paulo" of February 2nd of 2012 titled "Payroll tax exemption raises the total of tax paid by the ﬁrm in some sectors".

Considering only labor costs, the policy indeed reduces labor tax burden. Figure 1 shows the payroll tax
exemption effect for a hypothetical monthly wage of BRL1,000. In Brazil, a worker who receives a monthly
wage of BRL1,000 pays 8% of his or her wage to the National Social Security Institute (INSS), for a net
receipt of BRL920. The other taxes are paid by ﬁrms and are calculated as percentages of monthly wage: the
payroll tax is 20% (BRL200); "other entities" 5.8% (BRL58); and "accidents at work insurance" (SAT) 2%
more (BRL20)5. These costs sum 27.8% of the wage, for a gross wage bill of BRL1.278 in this example.
According to the proposed changes, the same worker would cost BRL1.078 to the company, a reduction of
71.9% of the labor taxes, and by 15.6% of the total wage cost of a formal laborer.

Before payroll tax reduction implementation, some studies aimed to discuss its likely effectiveness.
Luchiezi Jr (2011) concluded economic growth, interest rate and credit stimulate formal hiring more than
tax reductions. The author also considers this policy as a way to increase companies’ proﬁts without much
change in employment level. Paiva and Ansiliero (2009) also criticize this policy, considering it distorts the
Social Security System.

On the other hand, Ulyssea and Reis (2006) pointed out some evidences that labor costs affect formal
labor hiring, and therefore reductions in labor taxes boost employment. Bordonaro (2003) analyzed data
from nine Latin American countries, from 1980 to 2000, trying to identify formal employment causes, and
found that reductions in labor costs improve formal hiring, even though economic growth has a greater
impact. Fernandes et al. (2004) developed a general equilibrium model considering various changes in
taxation to calculate employment and production effects. Their estimations showed that substituting labor
taxes to consumption taxes potentially increases production by 6.5% and employment by 2.0%.

Looking at the relationship between labor demand and labor regulations, De Barros and Corseuil (2004)
tried to identify the effects of changes in labor legislation. Even though ﬁring costs increased almost four
times during the period analyzed by the authors, no signiﬁcant change on estimated labor demand curves
where observed.

5Some speciﬁcities can change the total amount of taxes paid by the ﬁrm. The tax for accident at work insurance (SAT), for
instance, can vary from 1% to 3% according to the hazard characteristics of the speciﬁc work that the employee is hired for, and
according to the companies’ investments on training and on security. There are also some additions in the base wage paid by the
ﬁrm according to the dangerousness related to the speciﬁc work. However, the example illustrates most of the cases for industrial
companies considered in this research.

approach after its implementation: Dallava (2014), Scherer (2015) and Garcia et al. (2018). The ﬁrst two
studies evaluated the policy effects for textiles, garment and leather and shoes industries, which were the
three manufacturing industries beneﬁted by the policy before its expansions in 2012 and 2014. Garcia et al.
(2018) estimated the effects for all industries affected by the policy from 2012 to 2017. Meanwhile Dallava
(2014) and Garcia et al. (2018) did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant effect, Scherer (2015) estimated an increasing of
14.4% for ﬁxed effects and 13.8% for difference-in-difference regressions.

Such a large disparity draws attention to its study identiﬁcation strategy, which will be analyzed closely
on this research. These estimates around 14% calculated by Scherer (2015) were estimated considering
only companies with less than 50 employees, which is more suitable for this study identiﬁcation strategy
according to the author. However, considering ﬁrms of all sizes, the estimated effect reduces to 4,6% for
ﬁxed effects regression. In this regard, both Dallava (2014) and Garcia et al. (2018) did not consider only
small ﬁrms on their sample used to estimate policy effects.

3 Methodology

Regarding the credibility of public policy evaluation, the Journal of Economic Perspectives published
in 2010 three articles whose main objective was to discuss the tradeoffs between RTCs methodologies and
structural models. The discussion was based on the classic work of Leamer (1983), who pointed out the lack
of credibility in empirical analyses. Angrist and Pischke (2010) classiﬁed the changes in this research ﬁeld
since then as a "credibility revolution". Nevo and Whinston (2010) summarized the discussion considering
much of this "credibility revolution" was related to improvements in quality and in availability of databases.
The development of several new methodological frameworks, more complex and able to deal with a large
number of cases, is also pointed out and the better understanding of the relationship between economic
theory and applied research also played an important role. They concluded that considering the wide range
of alternative methodologies, the choice among them relies mainly on speciﬁcs and, therefore, there is no
reason to rely more on experimental analysis or on structural analysis. However, the authors also pointed out
to the importance of external validity, that means, whether the results are valid for different contexts or even
different samples than the ones considered on RCTs models, which may be the reason for the divergence
among the studies which implemented such framework to evaluate the payroll tax exemption.

There are many factors to control in empirical analysis which affect industry performance and make
difﬁcult policy effects identiﬁcation. Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations, changes in international markets, or
changes in input markets can affect industrial performance and lead to biases in estimated policy effects.
Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the effects of the policy on a group of ﬁrms by comparing its effects
with what would have happened to this same group of ﬁrms if they were not beneﬁted by the policy. Since
it is impossible to observe it, the researcher must create a group of ﬁrms very similar to those which were
beneﬁted by the policy, but ended up not being affected by it.

In this section, our empirical strategy is based on Scherer (2015) in order to ﬁnd out the relationship
between the assumptions made by the author and his policy estimated effects. The author noticed that ﬁrms
under the tax regime called simples already did not pay the payroll tax before the policy. Therefore, ﬁrms
from the same sector which were under simples regime and had similar characteristics to ﬁrms beneﬁted by
the payroll tax exemption were considered as proxies to the behavior of the ﬁrms that were affected by the
payroll tax exemption, i.e. ﬁrms under simples are the control group and ﬁrms not under such tax regime and
affected by the policy are the treatment group.

Accordingly, the regression used to estimate the policy effect is as follows:

𝑌𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛿0𝑇𝑡 + 𝛽1𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑐ℎ𝑔𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽3𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡 + 𝑎𝑖 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡

(1)

where 𝑌𝑖𝑡 is the number of employees, 𝑇𝑖𝑡 is a dummy for time (being one for 2012), 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡 is the

6

treatment (being one for ﬁrms not under simples in 2012), 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑐ℎ𝑔𝑖𝑡 is a dummy for ﬁrms which changed its
tax regime from simples to non-simples or vice versa, 𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡 is the share of workforce with education level equal
or above the intermediary level. This equation is estimated by Fixed Effects and by difference-in-difference.
A non-parametric estimation of difference-in-difference indicates the changes in averages for outcome
variables across groups and time.

Since simples is a tax regime applied for smaller ﬁrms, Scherer (2015) considers that the suitable control
group is composed only by ﬁrms with less than 50 employees, which will also be the case in this study for
the baseline estimations. In order to investigate different ﬁrm sizes inﬂuence on policy effects estimations,
regressions will also be implemented considering only ﬁrms with 30 to 50 employees and the whole sample.
Regarding the structural model approach, according to Petrin and Sivadasan (2013), the difference
between the value of marginal product of a factor and its marginal cost, called gap, is a result of anything
that moves the economy away from neoclassical equilibrium in which they are equal, such as mark ups,
ﬁring and hiring costs, capital adjustment costs, taxes and subsides. Therefore, the payroll tax exemption is a
potential decrease in the gap on industrial labor market.

The gap is deﬁned by Petrin and Sivadasan (2013) as follows:

𝑖𝑡 = |𝑉 𝑀 𝑃 𝑙
𝐺𝑙

𝑖𝑡 − 𝑤𝑖𝑡|

(2)

where 𝐺𝑙

𝑖𝑡 is the gap on labor market, 𝑉 𝑀 𝑃 𝑙

𝑖𝑡 is the value marginal product of labor and 𝑤𝑖𝑡 is wage. The
gaps are calculated in Petrin and Sivadasan (2013) for two types of work: blue collar (unskilled employees)
and white collar (skilled employees).

Applying equation 2 to Chilean manufactory sector between 1980 and 1990, Petrin and Sivadasan (2013)
identiﬁed an increase in the labor market gaps. The authors considered that this increase was associated with
changes in Chilean labor market regulation, which increased hiring and ﬁring costs, as well as bureaucratic
costs.

Taking this approach to data, the ﬁrst step to estimate the gap is to calculate the value of marginal product
𝑖𝑡 is estimated as follows:

𝑖𝑡). Considering a Cobb-Douglas production function, the 𝑉 𝑀 𝑃 𝑙

of labor (𝑉 𝑀 𝑃 𝑙

𝑉 𝑀 𝑃 𝑙

𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽𝑙

𝑌𝑖𝑡
𝐿𝑖𝑡

(3)

where 𝑌𝑖𝑡 is output, 𝐿𝑖𝑡 is labor and 𝛽𝑙 is its marginal effect on output, calculated by the estimated

production function.

To simulate the policy effects on employment, 𝑌𝑖𝑡 was replaced in expression 3 by the Cobb-Douglas
production function in order to have the value of marginal product of labor (𝑉 𝑀 𝑃 𝑙
𝑖𝑡) in terms of production
function inputs. By substituting this relationship into gap deﬁnition in expression 2 and rearranging terms,
the quantity of labor used in production can be expressed in terms of other inputs, their coefﬁcients, wage
and gap as follows:

𝐿𝐵𝑖𝑡 = 1{0<𝑊 𝑙𝑏

3.1 Database

In order to evaluate the payroll tax exemption effects by using the RCT methodology, the variables
used are from the Annual Social Information Report (RAIS). The data are provided annually and contain
information about the ﬁrm size, location, ﬁrms sector, tax regime and employees characteristics.

A panel data set of existing ﬁrms in 2010, 2011 and 2012 was used. The variables used in this
research were the identiﬁcation of the ﬁrms, ﬁrms economic sector according to the National Economic
Activities Classiﬁcation (CNAE), tax regime and proportion of employees with schooling level equal or
above intermediary level.

Picture 2 shows the frequency of employees which work for companies grouped by the number of hired
workers separated between ﬁrms under simples regime and not under simples regime. For the whole sample,
for instance, 84.60% of employees hired by ﬁrms not under simples work for companies with one hundred or
more employees, meanwhile for companies under simples only 24.54% of employees work in companies
of such group. On the other hand, 5.56% of employees hired by ﬁrms under simples work for companies
with one to four employees, while only 1,02% of employees hired by ﬁrms not under simples work for such
group of ﬁrms. This means that simples is a tax regime which is adopted mainly by smaller companies.
Since the identiﬁcation strategy separates ﬁrms under simples as control group and ﬁrms not under simples
as treatment groups, the observed discrepancy between the groups for the whole sample suggests that such
strategy may not be suitable for the whole sample.

Picture 2 also shows that the distribution between groups of ﬁrms is much more similar between simples
and non-simples ﬁrms considering only ﬁrms with less than 50 workers. Non simples group still have
more employees on larger companies, but the discrepancy between groups is much lower in this sample. It
means that to consider ﬁrms with less than 50 employees makes treatment and control groups much more
similar, which endorses such identiﬁcation strategy. However, one can question whether the estimated effects
calculated by this methodology is valid for ﬁrms of all sizes. That is, by selecting only part of the sample,
the estimated effect may be speciﬁc for a particular kind of ﬁrms and not have external validity.

The average number of employees per ﬁrm –which is the variable used to estimate the policy effect–is
very close between treatment and control groups. This similarity is expected since treatment and control
groups consider both only ﬁrms with less than 50 employees, which makes the employment distribution
among ﬁrms similar between the groups as picture 2 showed. The average hourly wage, however, is higher
for treatment group, which may be related to the higher share of employees with education level equal or
above intermediary on treatment group. The share of male workers is also higher in treatment group.

Regarding the structural model, all variables are from the Annual Industrial Research - Enterprise (PIA -

All variables from "PIA-Empresa" were recorded at ﬁrm level. IBGE makes public only industry level
data, but data at ﬁrm level can be used after IBGE’s authorization and under IBGE’s supervision due to data
security reasons.

The 2011 ﬁrms’ assets were used as a proxy for capital stock. The 2010 capital values were calculated
subtracting the investments and adding back the depreciation from 2011 values, following the perpetual
capital stock method; this procedure was applied to construct the capital stock series for all years. This
procedure was used because capital stock values for the years before 2000 were not collected. The number

9

of employees in December 31st was used as labor quantity and their total compensation was used as wage
measure. Raw material purchases were used as intermediate consumption. Electric energy and fuel purchases
were used as purchased electricity and outsourcing expenditures as hired services. The revenues from sales
of industrial products were used as output measure.

All values were adjusted for inﬂation when suitable. The price index used to deﬂate the capital stock
series is the "implicit deﬂator of capital formation", published by IBGE through the Nacional System
Accounting. For other series, the index was the "wholesale price index", published by Getulio Vargas
Foundation (FGV). All monetary variables were expressed in 2011 BRL.

The period analyzed is from 1996 to 2011. The ﬁrms were grouped in industries according to the National
Economic Activities Classiﬁcation (CNAE). Industries with less than 1,000 observations during these 16
years were not considered. This procedure resulted in 183,940 observations, grouped in 52 industries. Among
these 52 industries, 4 presented problems on capital series construction. Therefore, the estimation sample
included 48 industries. From this set of industries, 9 presented econometric problems on production function
estimation, such as negative coefﬁcients, identiﬁcation problems or serial correlation. Therefore, the gap was
estimated for 39 industries. From these 39 industries, 31 were beneﬁted by the payroll tax exemption and
8 were not. In order to analyze the policy and to compare its results with those of the RCT approach, the
estimation of the policy results at ﬁrst were considered only for six industries, which are classiﬁed in three
groups: Textile, Garment and Leather and shoes.6

4 Production Function Estimation

The functional form considered was the Cobb-Douglas production function with production factors as

such:

𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽𝑙𝑏𝑙𝑏𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽𝑙𝑤𝑙𝑤𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑡 + 𝜔𝑖𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑡

(5)

where lower case indicates the natural logarithms, 𝑖 represents ﬁrms and 𝑡 years. 𝑦𝑖𝑡 is sales revenue,
𝑘𝑖𝑡 is capital, 𝑙𝑏𝑖𝑡 and 𝑙𝑤𝑖𝑡 are number of unskilled employees (blue collar) and skilled employees (white
collar) respectively, 𝑚𝑖𝑡 is value of intermediate materials, 𝑒𝑖𝑡 is value of purchased electricity and 𝑠𝑖𝑡 is
value of hired services. The terms 𝜔𝑖𝑡 and 𝜖𝑖𝑡 represent productivity shocks, where the ﬁrst is a transmitted
component, and the second is an iid (unexpected) productivity shock.

There are several potential biases in Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation of such a production
function. The econometric literature has focused mainly on simultaneity bias, which led to several alternative
methodologies. Table 4 contains a summary of alternative estimators that aim to correct the simultaneity bias,
as well as a brief description of the assumptions made and the most important references for each estimator.
The main source of simultaneity bias in production function estimation is the relationship among ﬁrms’
input choices and productivity shocks observed by ﬁrms, but not by the econometrician. In empirical
applications, this problem usually leads to an upward bias on labor coefﬁcient and to a downward bias on
capital coefﬁcient (Van Beveren, 2012, p.5).

Assuming each ﬁrm relates productivity expectations and input usage in the same way over the years,
this could be solved using the ﬁxed effects estimator (FE). In fact, Van Beveren (2012) pointed out that the
FE estimator was introduced in Economics by Mundlak (1961) in order to correct the simultaneity bias of
production functions. However, empirical practice shows this assumption is not valid, and the FE estimation
procedures has shown little advantage over the OLS to correct the simultaneity bias. Besides, for the series
which does not show much variability across time and have measurement error problems, ﬁxed effects
estimates are plagued by attenuation bias.

6Scherer (2015) estimate the effects of the policy also for services, which were also beneﬁted by the policy in 2012. However,

the production function estimation is not suitable for these industries.

An alternative is to consider some persistence in productivity shocks (usually an AR(1) process), which
results in a dynamic speciﬁcation for the production function. However, as pointed out by Cameron and
Trivedi (2005), the dynamic is not free of simultaneity bias, requiring instrumental variables. Arellano and
Bond (1991) developed an estimator that uses lagged values of variables as instruments in a Generalized
Method of Moments (GMM) estimator. However, Griliches and Mairesse (1995) pointed out that Arellano
and Bond (1991) instruments are valid but weak in this case, not helping with the downward bias on capital
coefﬁcient estimates, even though the labor parameters problem is solved. Besides, another issue commonly
observed in GMM production function estimators is a too low returns to scale estimate.

According to Bond (2000), the weak instruments problem can be solved by increasing the information
set used in estimation, which can be done by the use of suitably lagged ﬁrst differences of the variables as
instruments for the equations in levels. Both sets of moment conditions can be exploited as a linear GMM
estimator in a system containing both ﬁrst-differenced and levels equation. Combining both sets of moment
conditions provides the System GMM (SGMM) estimator. The authors show that the SGMM corrects the
capital downward bias and lead to a more reliable returns to scale estimates (Bond, 2000, p.7 and p.13).

The alternative way to treat simultaneity bias without considering a dynamic speciﬁcation is by con-
sidering the ﬁrms’ decisions about some other variable as a function of productivity shocks and try to use
this variable as a proxy for the unobserved productivity. Olley and Pakes (1996) originally developed this
methodology relating productivity and investment decisions, assuming a monotonically relationship between
them. With these assumptions in hand, it is possible to specify the productivity in terms of investment and
capital by a polynomial approximation. However, investments data might not be available in a way to help
estimation. Considering this problem, Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) developed a very similar methodology
using intermediate materials instead of investments as instrumental variables.

In both cases Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), the estimation has two steps:
in the ﬁrst step the labor coefﬁcients are estimated; in the second step the other coefﬁcients are estimated
non-parametrically. However, Ackerberg et al. (2006) pointed out the risk of collinearity in this procedure
and, in order to avoid econometric problems, suggested estimation of labor coefﬁcients in the second step
also. Wooldridge (2009) developed a GMM estimator that takes into account the considerations of Ackerberg
et al. (2006).

Since the literature does not have reached any consensus on which estimator is better in any econometric
sense, we compared the results of ﬁve different estimators: Fixed Effects, GMM, System GMM (SGMM),
Levinsohn and Petrin (LP) and Wooldridge. Figure 3 presents a kernel density histogram for the estimated

parameters of the six inputs in equation 57.

There is no expected bias on the coefﬁcients for intermediate materials, purchased energy and hired
services because most of the econometric considerations about simultaneity bias on production function
estimation consider only labor and capital as inputs. Nonetheless, Petrin and Sivadasan (2013) used the same
speciﬁcation and use same estimators as here; therefore, their results can guide our analysis.

The average estimated coefﬁcients for these three inputs obtained by Wooldridge’s methodology are very
close to the ones presented by Petrin and Sivadasan (2013), albeit using a different dataset. The intermediate
materials coefﬁcients estimated by Wooldridge’s methodology are more widespread than the ones estimated
by Petrin and Sivadasan (2013), which are more similar to the LP estimates.

Considering all methods, there is no big difference in estimates using different estimators. For hired
services, the FE, GMM and SGMM coefﬁcients are lower in average and have lower dispersion. The
distribution of capital coefﬁcient estimates is in accordance with the literature. Both FE and GMM coefﬁcients
are close to zero in most industries, suggesting the attenuation bias playing a role here. Besides, as pointed
out by Bond (2000), the GMM estimator cannot eliminate the simultaneity bias. By increasing the instrument
set, the SGMM was supposed to deal with this problem, and these results point in this way also. The LP and
Wooldridge estimators were able to correct the effects of simultaneity bias on capital as well.

Finally, literature points to an upward bias on labor coefﬁcient estimates; however, the LP estimated
parameters for the white collar labor are higher than the others. This result may be related to the problem in
Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) method pointed out by Ackerberg et al. (2006). For blue collar labor estimates,
the Wooldridge’s estimator leaded to lower coefﬁcients than the others estimators.

Therefore, the labor’s coefﬁcients estimated by productivity proxies–i.e. LP and Wooldridge–were apart
from each other and were not in accordance with prior literature. Besides that, the econometric tests revealed
a smaller number of industries with identiﬁcation problems for SGMM estimates than the others.

7The coefﬁcients and their identiﬁcation and serial correlation tests are presented on table 8 in Appendix.

The RCT approach applied in this research was based on Scherer (2015). The author’s results are very
different from other works which applied similar methodology, i. e. Dallava (2014) and Garcia et al. (2018).
Scherer (2015) found out divergent results when considering only ﬁrms with less than 50 employees and the
whole sample. Considering the whole sample, the payroll tax exemption estimated effect was 4.6%, while
the effect for the reduced sample was 14.4%. Such difference makes it important to understand the impact of
the sample considered to identify the policy effect. For that reason, in this research the policy impacts were
estimated considering three different samples: (i) ﬁrms with less than 50 employees, which is in accordance
with the identiﬁcation strategy; (ii) the whole sample, which harms the identiﬁcation strategy; and (iii) ﬁrms
with 30 to 50 employees, which is also in accordance with the identiﬁcation strategy, but eliminates the
smallest ﬁrms.

In order to check the common trend between treatment and control groups, picture 5–presented in
appendix–shows the average number of employees per ﬁrm evolution for the three samples and for treatment
and control groups in the period before the policy, i.e. 2010 and 2011, and right after the policy implementa-
tion in 2012. For ﬁrms with less than 50 employees, there is a common trend for average employees per ﬁrm
between 2010 and 2011, which endorses the identiﬁcation strategy. Also, both groups have close average
employees per ﬁrm–from 9.5 to 11. In 2012 this values grows markedly more for the treatment group, which
may be related to he payroll tax exemption, even though it is necessary to control other variables effects.
The common trend is not so accentuated considering ﬁrms with 30 to 50 employees. However, both groups
have very close average employees per ﬁrm, and the divergence between the values is reduced. Finally, for
the whole sample there is a remarkable divergence between the groups both for the variable trend before
the policy and for the average values. Therefore, the identiﬁcation strategy is justiﬁed and seems to be
consistent. However, it throws away as important part of the sample and may lead to a result which does not
have external validity, i. e., the estimated policy effect only for small companies.

The payroll tax exemption effects is estimated by equation 1 for the three samples and for Fixed Effects
and Difference-in-Difference procedures. Estimates are presented in tables 6 and 7 on appendix. For ﬁrms
with less than 50 workers, estimates are very close do the results found by Scherer (2015). With these
estimates and considering the average number of employees, the percetual impact on employment for each
samples, which is showed in table 5.

Accordingly to Scherer (2015) results, the estimated effects on employment are considerably higher for
the sample with less than 50 workers than for the whole sample both for ﬁxed effects and difference-in-
difference, even though the disparity is lower for our estimates. However, to consider the whole sample
increases disparity between control and treatment groups. In order to investigate if the policy impact depends
on ﬁrms sizes, policy effects were estimated for ﬁrms with 30 to 50 workers, which does not harm the
identiﬁcation strategy and allows to identify the effect for larger ﬁrms. The results presented indicated that
policy indeed have more effect on smaller ﬁrms, since the effects reduces from at around 14% to around 8%
for larger ﬁrms both for ﬁxed effects and difference-in-difference. Therefore, these estimates suggests that
Scherer (2015) results overestimate payroll tax exemption total effects and that the policy affects smaller
ﬁrms more.

Such conclusion may be interpreted in line with what Nevo and Whinston (2010) called the "external
validation". The best identiﬁcation strategy in this case for RCT methodology is to consider only ﬁrms
with less than 50 employees, and the results found by this research and by Scherer (2015) are consistent.
However, these results does not have external validation and it is not correct for the researcher to consider
such estimates for policy evaluation as a whole.

Regarding the payroll tax effects estimated by the structural model, the gaps used on the simulation were
calculated according to expression 2 with production function coefﬁcients estimated according to expression
4. These coefﬁcients where used to estimate the value of marginal product of blue and white collar labors
according to expression 3. The estimated gaps are in line with the results presented by Petrin and Sivadasan
(2013) for Chilean industry, both in terms of the relationship between gaps and average wage and for the gap
evolution across time.

To simulate the payroll tax exemption effects it was supposed 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% reductions
on gaps. The gaps used for simulation were gaps of 2011, the year before the payroll tax enforcement.
The simulation was calculated for all industries separately and for gaps calculated based on all production
function estimators, both for blue collar jobs, for white collar jobs, and both the general effect (i.e. blue
collar jobs plus white collar jobs). Gaps were estimated using the production function coefﬁcients estimated
by the ﬁve alternative estimator presented on section 3, i. e., System GMM (SGMM), GMM, Wooldridge,
Levinsohn and Petrin (LP) and Fixed Effects.

First, in order to check the relationship between the policy estimated effects by RCT approach and by
the structural model, the gap simulations ﬁrst presented are those for textile, garment and leather and shoes
industries, which were the industries also considered for the RCT estimates. Picture 4 shows the total effect
for the three sectors together, as well as estimated effects for each one. RCT estimative for ﬁrms with less
than 50 employees estimated by difference-in-difference are indicated by dashed lines.

Policy estimated effects are directly related to gaps sizes, which in its turn is also directly related to
production function coefﬁcients. As mentioned on section 4, Fixed Effects and LP resulted in overestimated
labor coefﬁcients, which are related to the higher policy effects estimated based on these coefﬁcients.
Considering total effects, textile and garment, these estimators lead to results close to those estimated by RCT

For leather
and shoes, these estimators lead to simulated changes on employment closer to difference-in-difference,
but even these results were signiﬁcant inferior to those calculated by RCT approach. This also means
that estimates presents by Scherer (2015) for the effects on this sector, which was 35.4% increasing in
employment, is overestimated.

Taking into account SGMM coefﬁcients, which were the coefﬁcients with best econometric tests perfor-
mance, structural model simulated policy effects are lower than those estimated by the RCT approach, even
considering 20% of gap reduction for all sectors. Considering aggregate effects on these three industries, the
results which considered only 5% of gap reduction are close to the estimates presented by Dallava (2014) and
Garcia et al. (2018), which did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant policy effect. For textile, structural model simulated
effects were also close to zero.

Since the payroll tax effects estimated by the gap methodology are based on production function
coefﬁcients, and not on observed statistics, it is possible to carry out counterfactual analysis in order to
estimate the policy likely effects on industries not affected by the policy. Therefore, the simulation was
calculated for all industries of the simples, i.e. for industries beneﬁted and not-beneﬁted by payroll tax
exemption. Since the non-beneﬁted industries were not affected by the policy, these results are projections of
likely effects of the policy, while beneﬁted industries estimates intend to estimate the changes that actually
happens as consequence of the policy. This is one advantage of structural approach over RCT models, which
cannot estimate likely effects on non-beneﬁted sectors.

Considering only industries beneﬁted by the police between 2012 and 2017, results show that payroll tax
exemption has an impact of 4.13% on employment for gap reductions of 5% on each sector. It is important to
notice this is not an estimative of the total effect of policy, since the group of industries considered here does
not include some sectors that were beneﬁted by it, as the Information Technology, for instance. This estimate
is higher than those of Garcia et al. (2018), which estimated no signiﬁcant policy effect for all industries
which were beneﬁted by the policy considering the whole time that it was in force.

Considering the same gap reduction of 5%, simulated policy effect for industries which were beneﬁted
in 2012 was 2.3%. Since the policy effect for all industries was 4.13%, the policy expansion on further
years increased the policy impacts by including sectors which were more sensitive to the policy. For all
industries, the simulated employment expansion caused by the same gap reduction is 3.71%. This means
further expansions on the group of beneﬁted industries would have positive but marginally decreasing effects.

6 Conclusion

A wide range of methodological frameworks and available data allows researchers to choose among
many alternative procedures to evaluate public policies. This research tried to study a case–payroll tax
exemption for Brazilian ﬁrms–in order to understand the relationship and complementarities between
Quasi-experiment–or RCT–and Structural Model.

Based on literature, the RCT approach considered at ﬁrst only ﬁrms with less than 50 employees in order
to increase similarities between control and treatment groups. Even though such procedure leads to similar
trends between control and treatment and to signiﬁcant estimated coefﬁcients, regression with whole sample
and only ﬁrms with 30 to 50 workers suggest that these identiﬁcation strategy lacks external validity, i. e.
results are valid only for small ﬁrms. Results from structural model also indicates that this RCT procedure
overestimates policy effects, since its results were lower than RCT’s even considering gap reductions of 20%.
Regarding the structural model estimates, results which considers gap reductions of 5% are more close to the
literature results which show that the policy had reduced effects, boosting employment only by 2.3%. This
approach also allows estimates of likely effects on other industries than only those beneﬁted by the policy.
This estimates shows that payroll tax expansions during 2012 and 2014 included industries which react more
to payroll tax exemption than the industries beneﬁted by the policy at ﬁrst, but further expansions would
improve employment by a lower rate. As conclusion, even though this research found positive effects for

15

payroll tax expansion, huge tax collection reductions for small impact on employment casts doubt up on this
policy cost-beneﬁt.
