Abstract 

transparency  can  mitigate 

 
Central  banks 
the  problems  regarding  asymmetric 
information  on  credit  market.  Therefore,  better  credit  market  conditions  can  induce 
banks  to  reduce  credit  spread.  The  present  study  analyzes  the  effect  of  central  bank 
transparency on credit spread based on a database of 65 countries for the period 2000 to 
2014. In order to evaluate the effect of central bank transparency on credit spread two 
transparency measures were used: transparency of financial stability and transparency of 
monetary  policy.  The  results  indicate  that  countries  in  which  central  banks  are  more 
transparent, credit spread is smaller. Moreover, credit spread in development countries 
are more impacted by central bank transparency than developed countries.

Resumo 

 
 
A transparência dos bancos centrais  pode mitigar os  problemas relativos  à informação 
assimétrica no mercado de crédito. Portanto, melhores condições do mercado de crédito 
podem  induzir  os  bancos  a  reduzir  o  spread  de  crédito.  O  presente  estudo  analisa  o 
efeito  da  transparência  do  banco  central  sobre  o  spread  de  crédito  com  base  em  um 
banco  de  dados  de  65  países  para  o  período  de  2000  a  2014.  Para  avaliar  o  efeito  da 
transparência do banco central sobre o spread de crédito foram usadas duas medidas de 
transparência:  transparência  da  estabilidade  financeira  e  transparência  da  política 
monetária.  Os  resultados  indicam  que  os  países  em  que  os  bancos  centrais  são  mais 
transparentes, o spread de crédito é menor. Além disso, o spread de crédito nos países 
em  desenvolvimento  é  mais  afetado  pela  transparência  do  banco  central  do  que  os 
países desenvolvidos.

1. Introduction 
 

Literature  about  credit  spread  emphasizes  the  role  of  risk  in  banking  activities. 
An important element, which justifies the risk effect on the credit spread, is the absence 
of  perfect  information  in  the  credit  market.   Hence,  the  lack  of  clarity  in  the  credit 
market  might  cause  banks  to  increase  their  risk  aversion,  generating  impacts  on  the 
credit  spread  (Ordoñez  2012;  Kwart,  2002;  Japelli  and  Pagano,  2000).  Credit  spread 
represents the margin charged by the banks to engage in financial intermediation. Since 
a stable financial system is known for being capable of continuously perform financial 
intermediation (Woodford, 2010; BCBS, 2010; Schinasi, 2004), high credit spreads can 
affect financial stability. 

Information  asymmetry is a typical  problem in  financial  markets,  as much as a 
financial  stability  risk.  Central  banks  transparency  are  able  to  minimize  the  current 
asymmetric  information  in  the  markets  and  reduce  the  uncertainty,  mitigating 
information  problems  on  the  credit  market  (Blinder  et  al.,  2008;  Knutter  et  al.,  2011; 
Born et al., 2012; Geraats, 2002). Therefore, better credit market conditions can induce 
banks to reduce credit spread. 

In order to measure the degree of transparency of the central bank as well as its 
impacts, the literature developed indexes which would capture the different degrees of 
central bank transparency of monetary policy (Eijffinger and Geraats, 2006; Dincer and 
Eichengreen,  2014).  After  the  crisis,  the  literature  on  central  banks  transparency 
expanded and metrics capable of measuring the transparency regarding the management 
of  financial  stability,  were  also  developed  (Cihak  et  al.,  2012;  Horvárth  and  Vasko, 
2016).  

The present study contributes to the literature by analyzing the effect of central 
bank  transparency  on  credit  spread.  For  that,  two  transparency  measures  are  used:  the 
financial  stability  transparency  measurement  (FST),  following  the  methodology 
developed  by  Horváth  and  Vasko  (2016),  and  the  transparency  measurement  of 
monetary policy used (MPT), an index developed by Dincer and Eichengreen (2014).  

In order to  consider the impact of Central  Bank Transparency on credit spread, 
panel  data  models  are  used.  The  sample  consist  of  65  countries  in  the  period  between 
2000  and  2014.  The  results  indicate  that  credit  spreads  are  smaller  in  countries  where 
the  central  bank  are  more  transparent.  In  addition,  the  effect  of  central  bank 
transparency  on  credit  spread  in  developing  countries  is  stronger  than  in  developed 
countries.  The  findings  of  this  paper  shed  light  on  a  possible  course  of  action  of 
policymakers  to  reduce  credit  spread.  Efforts  to  increase  transparency  in  the 
management of financial stability and transparency of monetary policy can lead to  the 
reduction of the credit spread, with consequent gains for financial stability. 

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  the  next  section  presents  the  data  and 
methodology  used  in  this  work.  In  section  3  the  results  are  presented  for  the  total 
sample and for two segmented samples: developed countries and developing countries. 
Finally, section 4 presents the conclusion of this study. 
 
2. Data and Methodology 

 

In order to evaluate the effect of central bank transparency on credit spread two 
 
transparency measures were used, transparency of financial stability and transparency of 
monetary  policy.  One  strand  of  the  central  bank  transparency  literature  follows 
Financial Stability Transparency (FST), that can be represented by the index developed 
by  Horváth  and  Vasko  (2016).  Another  related  strand  is  based  on  monetary  policy 

transparency index developed by Dincer and Eichengreen (2014) (hereafter referred to 
as  MPT). The summary  of the methodologies proposed by Horváth  and  Vasko (2016) 
and Dincer and Eichengreen (2014) are presented in the appendix, Table A6 and A7. 

In  addition  to  the  transparency  effect,  this  study  makes  use  of  other  variables 
that  the  literature  indicates  as  relevant  to  the  determination  of  credit  spread  (Aydemir 
and Guloglu, 2017, Birchwood et. al., 2017, Peria and Mody, 2004, Lima and Resende, 
2004, Maudos and De Guevara, 2004). In order to capture the effect of credit risk on the 
credit spread, the non-performing credit rate (NPL) is used. With the purpose of capture 
the effect of credit on credit spread the ratio Credit-to-GDP is introduces on analyzes. In 
view of the possible effects of monetary policy on the credit spread, the monetary policy   
interest  rate  was  used.  All  variables  extracted  from  the  database  of  the  World  Bank 
Group  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund.  Finally,  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  the 
Subprime Crisis on the spread, a crisis dummy which assumes the value of 1 in the years 
in  which  the  crisis  was  most  acute  (2008  and  2009)  and  zero  in  the  other  years,  was 
used. The description of the database, as well as the descriptive statistics of the variables 
used in this study, are presented in the appendix, Table A1 and A2, respectively.  
 
For a preliminary  analysis  of the relation  between the credit spread and  central 
bank  transparency,  figure  1  and  figure  2  are  presented.  The  negative  relation  between 
credit spread and financial stability transparency (FST), figure 1, and credit spread and 
transparency  monetary  policy  (MPT),  figure  2,  suggest  that  countries  whose  central 
banks are more transparent have a reduced credit spread.

As pointed out by Blinder et. al. (2008), the central bank releases have a prompt effect 
on  the  financial  markets,  however,  it  is  expected  that  the  other  variables  should  take 
effects in a lagged way. Moreover, it is reasonable to consider that credit spread is not 
independent  of  what  was  observed  in  the  past,  in  other  words,  there  is  a  persistence 
effect.  Finally,  considering  the  relevance  of  the  NPL  in  determining  the  credit  spread, 
the model proposed in this study is the following:  
 
                                                                                           (1)

real interest rate) and the CRISIS is a dummy variable, which assumes the value of 1 in 
the years in which the crisis was most acute (2008 and 2009) and zero in the other years 
and

is the error term.  

In order to estimate equation 1, we used OLS (Ordinary least squares), GMM in 
 
first difference (D-GMM) and system-GMM (S-GMM). It is important to highlight that 
the  use  of  the  dynamic  panel,  in  which  the  lagged  dependent  variable  is  used  as  an 
explanatory  variable,  allows  to  analyze  the  transparency  effect  on  the  spread  in  a 
parsimonious  model.  This  is  possible  due  to  the  fact  that  the  lagged  spread  possesses 
large  part  of  the  explanation  in  itself.  Despite  this  advantage,  the  use  of  the  lagged 
dependent  variable in  the models  generates  a dynamic  panel  bias  and inconsistency in 
OLS  estimators  (Baltagi,  2005).  To  overcome  this  problem,  the  literature  uses 
generalized moments methods (GMM), as suggested by Bond et al. (2001). 
 
It is important to highlight that the main results are those estimated by S-GMM 
method,  in  which  the  estimation  is  performed  using  instruments  at  differences  and 
lagged  levels,  which  mitigate  the  bias  risk,  low  accuracy  and  weak  instruments  that 
might  be  generate  by  the  first-difference.    (Blundell  and  Bond,  1998;  Arellano  and 
Bover,  1995;  Staiger  and  Stock,  1997).  Hence,  S-GMM  improves  the  performance  of 
the GMM first-difference estimator.  Despite the  problems pointed out  in  the OLS  and 
D-GMM methods, the results were reported in order to confirm the results of S-GMM. 
 
It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  the  instruments  in  the  estimations 
must  satisfy  the  proposed  conditions  by  Roodman  (2009),  that  is,  the  condition  of 
overidentification  of  the  instruments  must  be  guaranteed,  so  that  the  cross-section 
number is higher than the number of instrumented variables in order not to create results 
with bias. Thus, in order to confirm the validity of the instruments in the models, the J 
statistic  was  performed  as  a  test  of  excessive  identification  moment  conditions,  as 
suggested by Arellano (2003). 
 
 
3. Results 
 
 
This  section  presents  empirical  evidence  of  the  impact  of  central  bank 
transparency  on  credit  spread.  For  that,  two  subsections  are  presented:  the  first 
subsections  evaluates  the  effect  of  central  bank  transparency  on  credit  spread  for  the 
total  sample.  In  the  second  subsections,  from  the  restricted  samples  of  developed  and 
developing  countries,  it  is  analyzed  whether  there  are  distinct  impacts  of  the  effect  of 
central bank transparency on the credit spread between developing countries.  
 

 
3.1 – Does the central bank transparency reduce the credit spread? 
 

Taking  into  account  the  total  sample,  the  result  regarding  the  effect  of  central 
bank  transparency  on  the  credit  spread  are  presented  in  Table  1  and  2.  Table  1 
demonstrates the effect of financial stability transparency, and Table 2 demonstrates the 
effect of monetary policy transparency on the credit spread.  

The statistical significance from different methods (OLS, D-GMM and S-GMM) 
indicates that all forms of central bank transparency (FST and MPT) have an effect on 
credit  spread.  The  negative  signal  for  the  models  of  transparency  of  financial  stability 
and monetary policy suggests that, countries in which the central banks act with greater 

ittransparency, a reduction of the credit spread is perceived. That is, when central banks 
are more transparent they mitigate the credit market failure arising from the asymmetry 
of  information  between  banks  and  policymakers,  which  allows  banks  to  reduce  their 
risk aversion, therefore, reducing the credit spread.  

The lagged variable of the credit spread is significant and positive in all models, 
which suggests a persistence effect on the spread behavior. The positive signal and the 
statistical  relevance  of  the  credit  risk  (NPL)  indicates  that  the  higher  credit  risk,  the 
higher should be the credit spread, that is, the banks raise the spread as a way to protect 
themselves from possible future losses. 
Regarding  the  credit/GDP  ratio  on  the  spread,  the  results  are  contradictory  in 
 
terms of signal and significance. On the other hand, as expected, the interest rate and the 
dummy for crisis are positive and significant in all models. Hence, faced with a rise in   
interest  rate,  banks  react  with  an  increase  in  the  credit  spread  in  the  expectation  of 
defending themselves against a possible deterioration of the debtors' income. The crisis 
effect  on  credit  spread  suggests  that  banks  react  to  an  increase  in  risk  aversion  in  the 
economic environment through credit spread.

developing countries compared to developed countries? 
 
 
Central  banks  of  developed  countries  are  more  transparent  than  in  developing 
countries (Horváth and Vasko, 2016 and Dincer and Eichengreen, 2014). In this sense, 
the purpose of this subsection is to analyze whether there is a difference in the effects of 
central bank transparency on credit spread for developing and developed countries.  
In  general,  the  coefficients  of  the  transparency  indexes  (FST  and  MPT)  for 
 
developing  and developed countries present  statistical  significance  and negative signal 
similar to those reported in Table 1 and 2. In other words, the results presented in Table 
3,  4,  5  and  6  corroborate  the  findings  that,  countries  whose  central  banks  are  more 
transparent, tend to have lower credit spreads. The results reported in the Table (1 to 6) 
exhibit that all GMM estimates are overidentified (test J), and the serial autocorrelation 
tests (AR (1) and AR(2)) reject the hypothesis of the serial autocorrelation presence.  

 

It  is  important  to  highlight  that  the  coefficients  of  transparency  of 
financial  stability  and  monetary  policy  transparency  are  higher  in  developing  countries 
(Table 3) than developed countries (Table 4). One possible explanation for this result is 
that  in  the  least  developed  countries  there  is  less  information  available  in  the  credit 
market, which, therefore, makes the effect of central bank transparency more relevant in 
developing  countries  than  in  developed  countries.  At  last,  the  coefficients  on  the  other 
explanatory  variables  in  the  models  (SPREAD,  NPL,  CRED,  IR,  Crisis)  do  not  present 
significant  changes  from  those  observed  in  the  estimations  presented  in  the  previous 
subsections.

Robustness Analysis   

 
The results of the estimations in the previous subsections indicate that FST and 
MPT leads to a decrease in credit spread. In order to check the validity of this result we 
testing risk spread. The risk spread is available in the Global Economic Monitor (World 
Bank) and represents the difference between the lending interest  rate and the Treasury 
bill (USA short-term debt). The results are presented in table 7. 

In regarding the risk spread, it is important to highlight that the coefficients on 
FST  and  MPT  are  statistically  significant  and  negative  in  all  models.  Moreover,  the 
coefficients on the other explanatory variables in the models do not present significant 
changes  from  those  observed  in  the  estimations  presented  in  the  previous  subsections. 
Therefore, the results corroborate the effect of central bank transparency on credit spread find in 
this study.

Conclusion 
 
This  study  analyzed  the  effect  of  central  bank  transparency  on  the  credit 
 
spread for a sample of 65 countries in the period from 2000 to 2014. For that, we used 
two  measures  of  central  bank  transparency:  transparency  of  financial  stability  and 
transparency of monetary policy and a measure of credit spread disclosed by the world 
bank. 
The results of this study indicate that central bank transparency has an effect 
 
on  the  reduction  of  the  credit  spread.  This  result  suggests  that  the  transparency  of  the 
central  bank  is  able  to  mitigate  the  informational  problems  of  the  credit  market.  The 
findings  also  suggest  that  the  effect  of  central  bank  transparency  on  spread  in 
developing  countries  is  more  intense  than  in  developed  countries,  which  indicate  the 
relevancy  of  such  transparency  in  these  countries.  In  other  words,  efforts  to  increase 
central bank transparency can mitigate the informational problems of the credit market 
and thus improve financial intermediation through reduction of the credit spread.
