Abstract 
The  global  financial  crisis  and  the  debt  crisis  of  the  EU  countries  revealed 
serious  weaknesses  in  fiscal  reporting.  As  a  consequence,  uncertainties  regarding  the  real 
situation of the public accounts of the countries raised doubts in relation to the effectiveness 
of  government  policies.  Since  then,  countries  are  undertaking  reforms  in  order  to  improve 
fiscal  transparency.  The  present  paper  analyzes  whether  countries  are  making  efforts  to 
enhance fiscal transparency, and whether fiscal transparency affects government effectiveness 
as  well  as  government  spending  efficiency.  We  consider  two  channels  through  which  this 
effect  happens.  The  first  channel  is  indirect  and  it  works  through  public  debt.  The  second 
channel  is  the  direct  effect  that  transparency  has  on  government  effectiveness  once 
transparency  enhances  accountability  and  thus  the  task  of  resource  allocation.  We  use  a 
sample of 82 countries (68 developing and 14 developed) for the period 2006-2014, and panel 
data  analysis.  Comparing  the  scores  of  fiscal  transparency  between  2006  and  2014,  we 
observe  that  approximately  80  per  cent  of  the  countries  made  efforts  to  improve  fiscal 
transparency.  The  results  suggest  fiscal  transparency  is  important  to  improve  government 
effectiveness and government spending efficiency.

aumenta  a  responsabilidade  e  a  prestação  de  contas  dos  governos,  e,  portanto,  a  tarefa  de 
alocação  de  recursos.  Utilizamos  uma  amostra  de  82  países  (68  em  desenvolvimento  e  14 
desenvolvidos)  para  o  período  2006-2014,  e  a  análise  é  feita  pela  metodologia  de  dados  de 
painel. Comparando as pontuações da transparência fiscal entre 2006 e 2014, observamos que 
aproximadamente  80%  dos  países  se  esforçaram  para  melhorar  a  transparência  fiscal.  Os 
resultados  sugerem  que  a  transparência  fiscal  é  importante  para  melhorar  a  eficácia  do 
governo e a eficiência dos gastos públicos.

1. Introduction 

 
Fiscal  transparency  makes  the  formulation  of  policies  and  the  management  of  fiscal 
risks more effective, and ensures that governments provide more accurate information to the 
public  (IMF  2012).  Empirical  studies  have  found  that  transparency  in  the  management  of 
public  accounts  improves  fiscal  performance  and  fiscal  sustainability,  as  well  as  it  reduces 
corruption and markets volatility, and enhances the economic outlook (e.g., Kopits and Craig 
1998;  Islam  2006;  Alt  and  Lassen  2006a,  b;  Glennerster  and  Shin  2008;  Kolstad  and  Wiig 
2009; Peat et al. 2015; Arbatli and Escolano 2015). 

As the adoption of more transparent practices represents a  trend in the management of 
public accounts, the following questions arise: Are countries making efforts to enhance fiscal 
transparency?  Countries  with  higher  fiscal  transparency  also  present  increased  government 
effectiveness  and  higher  levels  of  government  spending  efficiency?  This  last  question  is 
important  since  uncertainties  regarding  the  real  situation  of  countries’  public  accounts  raise 
doubts in  relation  to  the effectiveness  of  government policies, and because the effectiveness 
of government policies is essential for the development of countries. 

In the present paper, we assess the efforts made by 82 countries in terms of increasing 
fiscal  transparency,  and  based  on  panel  data  methodology,  we  analyze  the  effect  of  fiscal 
transparency on both government effectiveness and government spending efficiency. As far as 
we  know,  this  study  is  the  first  to  present  such  empirical  evidences,  representing  a 
contribution  to  the  literature.  Based  on  the  argument  that  a  more  transparent  fiscal  system 
provides  policymakers  with  incentives  to  adopt  better  policies  (Arbatli  and  Escolano  2015), 
we suggest fiscal transparency improves government effectiveness and efficiency. 

Recently, Montes and Pachoal (2016) provided empirical evidence for the determinants 
of  government  effectiveness  for  a  set  of  130  countries  (30  developed  and  100  developing). 
Based  on  cross-country  analysis,  they  find  evidence  that  countries  with  the  most  indebted 
governments,  on  average,  have  less  government  effectiveness.  Nevertheless,  Montes  and 
Pachoal (2016) do not address the effect of fiscal transparency on  government effectiveness. 
In turn, Arbatli and Escolano (2015) find evidence that higher levels of fiscal transparency are 
associated with lower debt to GDP ratio.  

Similar  to  the  study  of  Arbatli  and  Escolano  (2015)  that  addressed  direct  and  indirect 
channels  through  which  fiscal  transparency  affect  credit  ratings,  we  consider  two  channels 
through which fiscal transparency affect government effectiveness (and government spending 
efficiency). The first channel is indirect and it works through the effect of fiscal transparency 
on public debt.  The second channel  is  the direct  effect  that transparency  has  on government 
effectiveness:  due  to  higher  transparency,  the  society  is  more  vigilant  and  more  active  in 
monitoring the accurate accountability of the government, which induces governments to  be 
more effective. 

As  a  measure  of  government  effectiveness,  we  use  the  “government  effectiveness” 
indicator  from  The  Worldwide  Governance  Indicators  (WGI)  project  –  provided  by  The 
World  Bank  Group.  Besides,  in  order  to  check  robustness,  we  build  an  indicator  of 
government spending efficiency based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA).

Regarding fiscal transparency, we use the fiscal transparency index of the International 
Budget Partnership (IBP) – the Open Budget  Index (OBI).1 The use of the OBI is due to its 
wide country coverage, public availability, and acceptance in the literature (Peat et al. 2015; 
Arbatli and Escolano 2015). Besides, according to Wehner and de Renzio (2013, pp. 99), the 
thoroughness  and  independence  of  the  OBI  research  process,  including  the  publication  of 
peer  reviews  and  editorial  decisions,  make  it  far  less  susceptible  to  government 
manipulation.2  

Comparing  the  scores  of  fiscal  transparency  for  the  82  countries  between  2006  and 
2014,  we  observe  that  approximately  80  per  cent  of  the  countries  made  efforts  to  improve 
fiscal transparency. Besides, the results indicate, for the three samples, that fiscal transparency 
plays an important role to improve government effectiveness. Furthermore, the results suggest 
the following implication for economic policy: developing countries aiming at amplifying the 
effects of fiscal transparency on government effectiveness should adopt inflation targeting. 

 

2. Data and Methodology 
 

We use a set of 82 countries (14 developed economies and 68 developing economies)3 
grouped in three samples: the first sample contains all 82 countries (full sample), the second 
sample  is  formed  by  68  developing  countries,  and  the  third  sample  is  formed  by  54 
developing  countries  that  do  not  adopt  Inflation  Targeting  (IT).  The  IT  framework  requires 
absence  of  fiscal  dominance,  and  thus  mechanisms  that  might  be  able  to  enhance  fiscal 
discipline.  The  study  of  Minea  and  Tapsoba  (2014)  find  evidence  that  the  adoption  of  IT 
improved  fiscal  discipline,  especially  in  developing  countries.  In  this  sense,  fiscal 
transparency represents an aspect able to increase fiscal discipline, and therefore, a necessary 
condition  that  countries  must  meet  in  order  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of  the  IT  regime. 
Hence,  the  idea  of  analyzing  developing  countries  that  do  not  adopt  IT  is  to  check  whether 
these  countries  improve  government  effectiveness  when  they  enhance  fiscal  transparency  – 
even if they do not adopt a commitment technology to inflation stability that demands fiscal 
discipline (such as IT). 

The period under analysis  is  from  2006 to  2014 with  annual  frequency.  The choice of 
the period is due to data availability – data for the OBI (the indicator of fiscal transparency), 
for example, begins in 2006. Below, we describe the variables used in the analysis.4 

The  dependent  variable  is  the  indicator  of  “Government  Effectiveness”  (GOV_EFF) 
which  is  obtained  from  the  World  Bank  WGI  data  base  (The  Worldwide  Governance 

                                                           
1  The  IBP  conducts  surveys  that  cover  the  availability  of  key  budget  documents,  which  relate  to  budget 
formulation,  budget  execution  and  budget  audit  processes,  the  legislative  strength  and  the  strength  of  the 
supreme  audit  institution.  The  main  OBI  survey  covers  the  availability,  clarity  and  quality  of  different  budget 
documents.  The  main  OBI  is  based  on  questions  that  cover  the  quality  and  comprehensiveness  of  eight  key 
budget documents: pre-budget statement, executive’s budget proposal, enacted budget, citizen’s budget, in-year 
reports,  mid-year  review,  year-end  report  and  audit  report.  The  Open  Budget  Survey  is  an  initiative  of  the 
International  Budget  Partnership,  an  independent  organization  that  evaluates  the  extent  to  which  governments 
make  their  budget  information  accessible  to  the  public  in  a  timely  manner.  For  our  analysis,  OBI  represents  a 
better measure of fiscal transparency than other measures  – such as, the International Monetary Fund’s Reports 
on  the  Observance  of  Standards  and  Codes  (ROSC)  and  stock-flow  adjustments  (SFA).  The  arguments  follow 
Peat et al. (2015). 
2 Wehner and de Renzio (2013) present several features that make the OBI data superior to those provided by the 
IMF. 
3 Table A.1 in the appendix presents the list of countries. The classification as developed and developing 
countries follows the International Monetary Fund (World Economic Outlook – WEO). 
4 Table A.2 presents the descriptive statistics for all variables used in the analysis.

Indicators).5 The indicator ranges from -2.5 (weak effectiveness) to 2.5 (strong effectiveness). 
This indicator is used in several empirical studies as regressor and as dependent variable. As 
dependent variable, the indicator was used, for example, in the studies of Garcia-Sanchez et 
al. (2013) and Montes and Paschoal (2016). 

In  turn,  the  main  explanatory  variable  is  fiscal  transparency.  As  a  measure  of  fiscal 
transparency  (named  TRANSPARENCY),  we  use  the  “Open  Budget  Index”  (OBI).6  In 
relation  to  the  OBI,  de  Renzio  and  Masud  (2011)  point  out  that  the  index  is  effective  and 
governments around the world are increasingly interested in their scores, and that civil society 
groups  had  been  using  their  recommendations  to  pressure  governments  to  improve  the 
transparency  related  to  budgetary  decisions.  According  to  Seifert  et  al.  (2013),  the  OBI 
contributes  in  an  exclusive  and  independent  manner,  providing  objective  data  regarding  the 
transparency  related  to  budgetary  procedures  of  a  number  of  countries  over  time.  This 
independent process guarantees the reliability of the presented data (Seifert et al. 2013). The 
OBI  ranges  from  0  to  100,  where  100  is  the  maximum  of  fiscal  transparency,  and  zero 
represents total opacity. 

Besides  the  direct  effect  of  fiscal  transparency  on  government  effectiveness,  we  also 
analyze  its  indirect  effect.  The  idea  of  this  indirect  effect  comes  from  Arbatli  and  Escolano 
(2015).  Therefore,  following  Alt  and  Lassen  (2006b)  and  Arbatli  and  Escolano  (2015),  we 
check  the  effect  of  fiscal  transparency  on  the  debt  to  GDP  ratio  (DEBT);  and,  following 
Montes and Paschoal (2016), we check the effect of the DEBT on GOV_EFF. The series of 
DEBT is obtained from the International Monetary Fund. 

In turn, according to Montes and Paschoal (2016), corruption causes resource leaks that 
undermine  government  effectiveness.  In  addition,  since  corruption  creates  waste,  it  leads 
governments  to  spend  more,  and  therefore,  to  become  more  indebted.  Cooray  et  al.  (2017) 
suggest that an increase in corruption leads to an increase in public debt. Thus, the corruption 
variable  is  used  in  the  analysis  explaining  both  DEBT  and  GOV_EFF.  As  a  proxy  for 
corruption, we use the Control of Corruption Perception Indicator (named CORRUPTION) – 
obtained from the World Bank WGI data base. CORRUPTION varies between  -2.5 and 2.5, 
in which the greater the indicator the greater is the control of corruption. 

The control variables used to explain the DEBT comes from the literature (e.g., Alt and 
Lassen,  2006b;  Arbatli  and  Escolano,  2015).  In  this  sense,  we  use:  the  GDP  growth  rate 
(GROWTH)7, the government expense as a percentage of GDP (EXPEND)8, and, following 
IMF (2007), we include the degree of globalization (GLOBAL)9. 

In addition to using DEBT and TRANSPARENCY to explain GOV_EFF, we follow the 
literature (e.g., Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2013; Montes and Paschoal 2016) and use the following 

                                                           
5 According to its definition, the indicator reflects perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the 
civil service and the degree of its  independence  from political pressures, the quality of policy  formulation and 
implementation, and the credibility of the government’s commitment to such policies. 
6 The OBI is obtained from the International Budget Partnership (IBP). For the IBP, fiscal transparency is central 
and should be translated into greater access of the society  to information about different types of expenditures, 
and how tax revenues and other public resources are used by governments. In this sense, the IBP launched the 
“Open Budget Initiative” through the Open Budget Survey  – a comprehensive analysis and survey that assesses 
whether governments give the public access to budget information and opportunities to participate in the budget 
process  at  the  national  level.  From  this  initiative,  in  order  to  measure  the  global  commitment  of  the  countries 
surveyed with transparency and to allow cross-country comparisons, the IBP created  – based on the research – 
the OBI. 
7  GROWTH  is  the  annual  percentage  growth  rate  of  GDP at  market  prices  based  on  constant  local  currency  – 
aggregates are based on constant 2005 U.S. dollars – obtained from the World Bank Data. 
8 Obtained from the World Bank Data. 
9  The  overall  globalization  index  is  the  index  of  globalization  proposed  by  Dreher  (2006),  obtained  from 
http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/.  The  idea  is  that  globalization  enhances  fiscal  discipline,  once  it  reinforces 
market discipline of fiscal policies, bringing improvements in debt structures (IMF, 2007).

control  variables:  the  inflation  rate  (INFLATION)10,  GDP  per  capita  (GDP_PC)11,  trade 
openness (TRADE)12, the indicator of rule of law (RULE)13, and CORRUPTION.  

Regarding  fiscal  transparency,  following  Wehner  and  de  Renzio  (2013),  countries  can 
be  divided  into  five  groups  based  on  their  overall  index  scores,  distinguishing  governments 
that disclose extensive (81– 100; Group 1), significant (61–80; Group 2), some (41–60; Group 
3),  minimal  (21–40;  Group  4),  and  scant  or  no  information  on  the  budget  (0–20;  Group  5). 
Considering the sample of all countries, figure 1 shows the graph with this groups and reveals 
the countries that presented improvement in fiscal transparency in terms of changing from one 
group to another over time (comparing 2006 to 2014). The graph uses darker colors to denote 
groups  of  countries  with  more  fiscal  opacity,  and  as  the  regions  become  clearer  this  means 
more fiscal transparency. The results reveal the following changes: from Group 5 to Group 4 
(Angola  and  Burkina  Faso);  from  Group  4  to  Group  3  (Albania,  Nicaragua,  Honduras, 
Ecuador,  Azerbaijan,  El  Salvador,  Mongolia,  Bangladesh  and  Uganda);  from  Group  3  to 
Group  2  (Philipinnes,  Malawi,  Mexico,  Bulgaria  and  Russian  Federation);  from  Group  2  to 
Group 1 (Norway and Sweden).

Figure  1  shows  that  66  countries  improved  their  fiscal  transparency  (corresponding  to 
80 percent of the sample). When we consider the 68 developing countries, we observe that 56 
countries improved their fiscal transparency (which corresponds to approximately 82 percent 
of  the  sample  of  developing  countries);  and,  when  we  consider  the  54  developing  countries 
that do not adopt IT, we observe that 44 countries improved their fiscal transparency (which 
corresponds  to  approximately  81  percent  of  the  sample  of  developing  countries  that  do  not 
adopt IT). 

In order to analyze the influence of fiscal transparency on government effectiveness, we 
consider  two  different  channels  through  which  fiscal  transparency  affects  government

effectiveness. The first channel is indirect. Following Alt and Lassen (2006b) and Arbatli and 
Escolano  (2015),  the  idea  is  that  fiscal  transparency  is  strongly  associated  with  lower  debt 
levels  because  a  more  transparent  fiscal  system  provides  policymakers  with  incentives  to 
adopt responsible fiscal policies. Therefore, the first channel is analyzed through equation (1) 
below:  

 

                                                     
 
where the subscript i=1,2,…,82 is the country and t=1,2,…,9 is the period. The set of control 
variables (     ) consists of: GROWTH, EXPEND, CORRUPTION and GLOBAL. The set of 
control  variables  follows  the  literature  (e.g.,  Alt  and  Lassen  2006b;  IMF  2007;  Arbatli  and 
Escolano 2015). In turn,    captures country specific effect,    takes into account the relevant 
time effect and      is a random error term that captures the effect of all omitted variables. 

(1) 

The second channel is the direct channel, and it is analyzed through equation (2) below: 

 
                                                                
 
where     captures country specific effect,     takes into account  the relevant  time effect  and 
      is  a  random  error  term  that  captures  the  effect  of  all  omitted  variables.  The  term        
represents  a  vector  of  control  variables.  In  order  to  define  the  set  of  control  variables,  we 
follow  Montes  and  Paschoal  (2016)  and  Garcia-Sanchez  et  al.  (2013),  which  analyze  the 
determinants of government effectiveness. Thus, the set of control variables (     ) consists of: 
INFLATION, GDP_PC, TRADE, RULE and CORRUPTION. Different from Garcia-Sanchez 
et  al.  (2013)  and  Montes  and  Paschoal  (2016),  our  analysis  includes  the  effect  of  fiscal 
transparency. 

(2) 

We use panel data analysis. Besides usual OLS method for panel data analysis, we make 
use of dynamic panel  data framework (D-GMM  and S-GMM).  As pointed out  by  Arellano 
and  Bond  (1991),  an  advantage  of  using  the  dynamic  panel  data  method  (GMM)  is  that  it 
eliminates the non-observed effects  on the regressions and the estimates are reliable even in 
the  case  of  omitted  variables.  In  particular,  the  use  of  instrumental  variables  allows  the 
estimation  of  parameters  more  consistently,  even  in  the  case  of  endogeneity  in  explanatory 
variables and the occurrence of measurement errors (Bond et al. 2001).  

Although D-GMM and S-GMM estimation approaches are suitable for a small number 
of time periods (t) and a large number of individuals (i), in the case of small samples,  when 
the instruments are too many, they tend to over-fit the instrumented variables creating a bias 
in  the  results  (Roodman  2009).  Therefore,  with  the  objective  of  avoiding  the  use  of  an 
excessive number of instruments in the regressions and thus lose the power of tests, we report 
the  number  of  instruments  (as  suggested  by  Roodman  2009)  through  the  number  of 
instruments/number  of  cross-sections  ratio,  which  must  be  less  than  1  in  each  regression. 
Moreover, in order to confirm the validity of the instruments in the models, the test of over-
identifying restrictions (J-test) was used as suggested by Arellano (2003). In addition, tests of 
first-order (AR1) and second-order (AR2) serial correlation were performed.  

 

3. Results 
 

Tables 1, 2 and 3 show the results of the estimates for equation 1, for the full sample, 
the sample of developing countries, and the sample of developing countries that do not adopt 
IT,  respectively.  The  results  for  all  the  samples  indicate  that  there  is  a  significant  effect  of 
fiscal transparency on DEBT, i.e., an increase in fiscal transparency reduces the debt to GDP 
ratio.

Arbatli and Escolano (2015) found that fiscal transparency, in advanced economies, has 
a significant effect on the debt to GDP ratio, but regarding the full sample and the sample of 
developing  economies,  they  found  evidence  that  the  effect  of  fiscal  transparency  on  debt  is 
small  and  it  does  not  present  statistical  significance.  Our  results  support  the  idea  that  fiscal 
transparency is important to fiscal performance, no matter the sample we are considering. 

In  terms  of  control  variables,  the  estimates  show  (for  all  the  three  samples)  that  low 
economic  growth  leads  to  higher  debt  accumulation  –  this  result  corroborates  the  evidence 
presented by Ogawa et al. (2016). In turn, the estimated coefficients for EXPEND present the 
expected positive sign and statistical significance in all GMM estimates for the three samples, 
implying that the higher the government expenditure, the higher the public debt to GDP ratio 
– this result corroborates Cooray and Schneider (2017). Moreover, the estimates for the three 
samples reveal that the effect of globalization on public debt was found to be negative – this 
result  is  in  line  with  the  ideas  presented  by  IMF  (2007):    globalization  enhances  fiscal 
discipline  once  it  reinforces  market  discipline  of  fiscal  policies,  bringing  improvements  in 
debt structures. 

Regarding the relationship between CORRUPTION and DEBT, the findings reveal that 
countries with higher scores in terms of control of corruption also present lower public debt. 
Therefore,  the  control  of  corruption  is  an  important  aspect  to  improve  fiscal  performance. 
This  finding is  consistent  with  the evidence provided by Elgin  and Uras  (2013) and Cooray 
and Schneider (2013).  

In  turn,  tables  4,  5  and  6  show  the  results  of  the  estimates  of  equation  2,  for  the  full 
sample,  the  sample  of  developing  countries,  and  the  sample  of  developing  countries  that  do 
not adopt IT, respectively. 

In  relation  to  the  direct  effect,  the  results  indicate  that  countries  with  higher  scores  of 
fiscal  transparency  also  present  higher  levels  of  government  effectiveness.  Therefore,  more 
transparent fiscal procedures are important to improve government effectiveness. Comparing 
the  coefficients  obtained  from  the  three  samples  through  GMM  estimates  (D-GMM  and  S-
GMM), the findings suggest that the effect of fiscal transparency on government effectiveness 
is  higher  in  the  sample  of  developing  countries.  However,  the  estimates  reveal  that  IT  is 
important,  i.e.,  the  estimated  coefficients  through  D-GMM  and  S-GMM  for  the  effect  of 
TRANSPARENCY on GOV_EFF for the sample of developing countries that do not adopt IT 
are  smaller  than  those  for  the  sample  of  developing  countries  (which  also  contains  IT 
developing  countries).  In  this  sense,  the  results  offer  an  interesting  insight  that  suggests  the 
following  implication  for  economic  policy:  developing  countries  that  seek  to  achieve 
amplified  effects  of  fiscal  transparency  on  government  effectiveness  should  adopt  a 
commitment technology, such as the inflation targeting regime. 

In  turn,  the  estimates  reveal  (for  the  three  samples)  that  DEBT  affects  GOV_EFF.  In 
line  with  the  findings  presented  by  Montes  and  Paschoal  (2015),  the  results  indicate  that 
countries  with  the  most  indebted  governments,  on  average,  have  lower  government 
effectiveness. In this sense, the results indicate the existence of a transmission mechanism and 
thus the indirect effect that fiscal transparency has on GOV_EFF through DEBT. 

In  terms  of  control  variables,  the  findings  for  the  three  samples  suggest  that  countries 
with higher inflation rates present lower levels of GOV_EFF. Besides, the evidence points – 
with statistical significance for all samples – that, an increase in rule of law represents a good 
strategy  to  improve  GOV_EFF.  Moreover,  estimates  for  the  effect  of  TRADE  had  positive 
coefficients  for  all  samples,  and  statistical  significance  was  found  for  all  the  three  samples. 
All these results are in accordance with the findings of Montes and Paschoal (2015). 

Regarding  the  effect  of  corruption,  the  evidence  points  that  corruption  affects 
GOV_EFF  –  statistical  significance  is  found  for  the  three  samples.  Thus,  the  reduction  of 
corruption is an important condition to improve GOV_EFF.

4. Fiscal transparency and government spending efficiency: robustness analysis 
 

In this section, we check the robustness of our empirical results by analyzing the effect 
of fiscal transparency on the efficiency of government spending. For this, we use an indicator 
of government spending efficiency (GSE) that we build for each of the 75 countries14 of our 
sample  for  the  period  2006-2014.  Following  Gupta  and  Verhoeven  (2001)  and  Chan  et  al. 
(2017), government spending efficiency is defined as the ability of the government to produce 
more outputs for a given level of resources. In this sense, the indicator of GSE is build based 
on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA).  

DEA  is  a  non-parametric  statistical  technique  used  to  assess  public  sector  efficiency. 
Hence,  to  construct  the  indicator  of  GSE  we  follow  the  literature  that  uses  DEA  to  assess 
public sector efficiency and government spending efficiency (e.g., Smith and Mayston 1987; 
Afonso  et  al.  2005,  2010;  Afonso  and  Aubyn  2005;  Afonso  and  Fernandes  2006;  Rayp  and 
De  Sijpe  2007;  Hauner  2008;  Chan  et  al.  2017).  The  indicator  of  GSE,  besides  providing 
robustness to the results obtained in the previous section, contributes to the literature once an 
analysis for the influence of fiscal transparency on government spending efficiency has never 
been done.  

DEA  is  a  linear  programming  method  that  had  been  popularized  by  Charnes  et  al. 
(1978).15  DEA  is  based  on  Pareto-efficiency,  where  the  most  efficient  decision-making  unit 
(DMU) is said to operate on the frontier and the DMUs below the frontier are considered as 
inefficient as compared to the benchmark bank.  In the present  study, the  DMUs refer to  the 
countries where we assume that the government  uses  an input (Government  Expenditure) to 
achieve goals. 

DEA was originally based on the assumption of constant returns to scale (Charnes et al. 
1978), where the DMU is assumed to proportionately increase their inputs and outputs in their 
production process to achieve efficiency. Banker et al. (1984) further revised the DEA model 
to account for variable return to scale (VRS) situation. According to Chan et al. (2017), VRS 
is  more  realistic  for  real-world  application,  where  the  DMUs  are  constraint  with  market 
imperfection such as imperfect competition, government regulations and financial constraint, 
which  leads  to  a  disproportionate  increase  in  inputs  and  outputs  in  the  production  process. 
Thus, such as Chan et al. (2017), we adopt the DEA model based on the VRS assumption.  

Below  we  present  the  analytical  description  of  the  linear  programming  problem  to  be 
solved in the VRS hypothesis. The DEA estimation based on VRS assumption is presented in 
Equation (3). 
 
                                           (3)    
                 
             
         
       

                                                           
14 Initially, the sample consisted of 82 countries. However, due to availability of data for the construction of the 
indicator,  the  following  countries  were  taken  from  the  sample:  Congo  Dem.  Rep.,  Algeria,  Iraq,  Niger,  Papua 
New Guinea, Sudan and Tuvalu. 
15  Using  linear  programming,  a  frontier  of  best-practice  countries  is  constructed  based  on  input-output  data, 
which  is  then  used  as  a  benchmark  against  which  the  performance  of  less  efficient  units  can  be  assessed.  The 
estimated frontier thus “envelops” all available observations, and each deviation from that frontier is interpreted 
as an inefficient combination of inputs and/or outputs. Farrell (1957) first suggested that such linear convex hull 
approach could be used for estimating the frontier of production possibilities and measuring efficiency. Charnes 
et al. (1978) then formalized the DEA methodology using linear programming to construct the frontier.

where   is the efficiency for each country i with 1/  as the technical efficiency scores which 
range between 0 and 1.16    − 1 is the proportional increase in outputs that could be achieved 
by  the  ith  country  at  a  given  level  of  input,  and  1  ≤    <  .  The  vector  xi  is  the  input  for 
country ith and the vector qi represents the output for country ith. In turn,   is a I × 1 vector 
constant, which measures the weights used to compute the location of an inefficient DMU if it 
were  to  become  efficient.  The  restriction            imposes  convexity  of  the  frontier, 
accounting  for  variable  returns  to  scale.  Dropping  this  restriction  would  be  tantamount  to 
admitting that returns to scale were constant. X is a matrix formed by the transpose vectors of 
outputs of all DMUs in the sample; Q is a matrix formed by the transpose vectors of inputs of 
all DMUs in the sample. 

The  input  and  outputs  used  in  the  DEA  follow  Afonso  et  al.  (2005,  2010).  We  use  as 
input the General Government Final Consumption Expenditure (% of GDP)17, and as outputs 
we  use  indicators  of  public  sector  performance  divided  into  two  types:  “opportunity 
indicators”  and  “Musgravian  indicators”18.  Regarding  opportunity  indicators,  we  use  three 
variables of the administrative dimension (corruption, red tape and quality of judiciary)19, one 
variable  of  the  educational  dimension  (quality  of  math  and  science  education)20,  and  two 
variables for the dimension of health (life expectancy at birth and infant survival rate)21. For 
the  Musgravian  indicators,  we  use  one  variable  to  capture  distribution  (Gini  coefficient)22, 
two  variables  for  the  stability  dimension  (inflation  and  stability  of  GDP  growth)23,  and  two 
variables  for  the  dimension  of  economic  performance  (unemployment  and  GDP  growth 
rate)24.  To  build  the  indicator  of  GSE,  we  used  the  software  R  –  package  “Benchmarking” 
developed by Bogetoft and Otto (2011). 

 After  constructing  the  indicator  for  the  75  countries,  we  estimate  equation  4  below 

through S-GMM.  

 

                                                          
 
where  the  subscript  i=1,2,…,75  is  the  country;  t=1,2,…,9  is  the  period,     captures  country 
specific effect,    takes into account the relevant time effect and      is a random error term 
that captures the effect of all omitted variables.       is a vector of control variables formed by 
the same control variables of equation (2). Again, the estimates are made for the full sample, 
the  sample  of  developing  countries,  and  for  the  sample  of  developing  countries  that  do  not 
adopt IT.

18  According  to  Musgrave  (1959),  the  government  has  three  basic  functions:  allocative,  distributive  and 
stabilizing. 
19 Data for “corruption” obtained from the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). Data for “red tape (burden 
of regulation)” and “quality of judiciary” are both obtained from Global Competitiveness Report. 
20 Obtained from Global Competitiveness Report. 
21 Data for “life expectancy at birth” is obtained from the World Bank (WDI). The series of “infant survival rate” 
(ISR) is calculated using the “infant mortality rate” (IMR) obtained from the World Bank, where, ISR = (1000 – 
IMR) /1000. 
22 For this series, we used the construction (100 – Gini). The data is obtained from the World Bank. 
23  The  series  of  “inflation”  is  calculated  using  the  Consumer  Price  Index  (annual  percentage  change)  obtained 
from the World Bank data – and to build the indicator of GSE, we use its inverse. For the series of “stability of 
GDP growth”, we use the inverse of the coefficient of variation of “per capita GDP growth” (obtained from the 
World Bank (WDI)).  
24 Both “unemployment” and “GDP growth rate” are obtained from the World Bank data.

the  expected  signs,  and  statistical  significance  (in  the  three  samples),  indicating  that  an 
increase  in  fiscal  transparency  increases  government  spending  efficiency.  Once  again,  the 
estimates  reveal  that  IT  is  important,  i.e.,  the  estimated  coefficients  for  the  effect  of 
TRANSPARENCY on GSE for the sample of developing countries that  do not adopt  IT are 
smaller than those for the full sample and for the sample of developing countries (which also 
contains  IT developing countries). Therefore, developing  countries aiming at  amplifying the 
effects of fiscal transparency on government spending efficiency should adopt IT. 

In relation to the effect of public debt on the indicator of GSE, the estimates show (for 
the three samples analyzed) that countries with higher public debt tend to have less efficiency 
in  government  spending.  As  a  consequence,  the  results  also  indicate  the  existence  of  a 
transmission mechanism and, therefore, the indirect effect that fiscal transparency has on GSE 
through public debt. Therefore, the results highlight the importance of fiscal transparency for 
keeping governments accountable in relation to their debts and spending, and thus to increase 
efficiency. 

Regarding  the  control  variables,  the  results  obtained  for  the  three  samples  suggest 
higher inflation rates are related to lower GSE. Therefore, inflation is  harmful to the process 
of  resource  allocation  and  makes  governments  less  efficient.  In  addition,  estimates  for  the 
effect  of  GDP  per  capita  and  trade  openness  on  GSE  present  positive  coefficients  for  all 
samples, and with statistical significance, corroborating the findings previously reported, and 
some findings in the literature (e.g., Afonso et al. 2010). 

 The results also suggest an increase in the rule of law improves the efficiency of public 
spending, with statistical significance for all samples. In turn, an important result concerns the 
effect of the control of corruption on the efficiency of government spending. Since corruption 
distorts  the  process  of  resource  allocation,  it  makes  governments  less  efficient.  The  results 
indicate, with statistical significance for the three samples, the control of corruption positively 
affects government spending efficiency.

5. Concluding remarks 

 
This  study  aims  at  showing  the  efforts  made  by  countries  in  order  to  increase  fiscal 
transparency,  and  as  a  consequence,  it  aims  at  capturing  the  relationship  between  fiscal 
transparency and government effectiveness. Based on a sample of 82 countries (14 developed 
countries and 68 developing  countries)  grouped  in  three samples, the results suggest (for all 
the  samples)  that  fiscal  transparency  has  a  statistically  significant  influence  on  both 
government effectiveness and government spending efficiency. The positive effect is relevant, 
and robust to different specifications and the inclusion of control variables. 

Based  on  the  findings,  fiscal  transparency  has  a  direct  effect  on  government 
effectiveness (and efficiency), and an indirect effect through its role in promoting better fiscal 
policies.  The  results  indicate  that  both  developed  and  developing  countries  can  benefit 
significantly in terms of lower public debt by increasing their fiscal transparency. 

We can draw the following policy conclusion from our findings. Governments seeking 
to  improve  effectiveness  and  efficiency  should  increase  fiscal  transparency.  Besides,  if 
governments  of  developing  countries  aim  at  amplifying  the  effect  of  fiscal  transparency  on 
effectiveness and efficiency, they should adopt IT.
