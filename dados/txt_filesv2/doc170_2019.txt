ABSTRACT: Several studies have been developed to assess the presence of polycentric cities analyzing 
the spatial distribution of employment into urban space. Most of these studies are concerned to cites in 
developed countries and few have explored the polycentric urban structure of cities in developing countries, 
particularly  to  Latin  America.  Furthermore,  the  use  of  urban  planning  policies  and  their  influence  in 
promoting subcenters has been left aside in empirical work. In that sense, the city of Curitiba (Brazil) 
emerges as focal point in this analysis. Since the 1970’s Curitiba adopted a TOD oriented urban planning 
policy searching to promote polycentricity. The core of this policy is the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system 
in combination with land-use patterns which were established over the last decades and are the main force 
influencing the distribution of people and economic activities across the city. This paper aims to assess the 
presence of employment subcenters in Curitiba and how it intertwines to the BRT system. In order to 
identify the employment subcenters we use the semi-parametric approach developed by McMillen (2001) 
and  to  assess  whether  the  CBD  remains  as  the  main  employment  attractor  in  a  polycentric  city.  The 
employment database contains data on formal employment at the firm level provided by the Ministry of 
Employment for the year of 2010, representing 50,553 firms and 658.061employees in the city. These data 
were georeferenced in grid cells of 1 square kilometer over the city. The results show that Curitiba has a 
polycentric structure composed by nine employment subcenters. The spatial distribution of these subcenters 
is highly correlated to the BRT network, evidencing the role of TOD urban planning policy in shaping the 
polycentric structure.

RESUMO:  Diversos  estudos  foram  desenvolvidos  para  avaliar  a  presença  de  subcentros  de  emprego 
analisando a sua distribuição espacial no espaço urbano. Em sua maioria eles analisam países desenvolvidos 
e poucos estudos exploraram as cidades dos países em desenvolvimento, particularmente a América Latina. 
Além disso, a relação entre políticas de planejamento urbano e sua influência na formação de subcentros 
pouco foi analisada em trabalhos empíricos. Nesse sentido, a atenção se volta para a cidade de Curitiba 
(Brasil). Desde a década de 1970, Curitiba adotou uma política de planejamento urbano orientada para o 
desenvolvimento  de  subcentros.  O  núcleo  dessa  política  é  o  sistema  BRT  (Bus  Rapid  Transit)  que 
combinado com as políticas de uso da terra que foram estabelecidas nas últimas décadas compõem as 
principais forças que influenciam a distribuição de pessoas e atividades econômicas na cidade. Este trabalho 
tem como objetivo avaliar a presença de subcentros de emprego em Curitiba e como eles se relacionam 
com o BRT. Para identificar os subcentros de emprego e avaliar se o CDB permanece como o principal 
atrator de emprego na cidade utilizamos a abordagem semi-paramétrica desenvolvida por McMillen (2001). 
A base de dados contém informações sobre o emprego formal no nível da empresa fornecido pela RAIS no 
ano  de  2010,  contendo  50.553  empresas  e  658.061empregados  na  cidade.  Esses  dados  foram 
georreferenciados em células de 1 quilômetro quadrado sobre a cidade. Os resultados mostram que Curitiba 
possui uma estrutura policêntrica composta por nove subcentros de emprego. A distribuição espacial desses 
subcentros  é  altamente  correlacionada  à  rede  BRT,  evidenciando  o  papel  da  política  de  planejamento 
urbano na formação de subcentros de emprego.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Initial models of economic urban theory developed by Alonso (1964), Mills (1967) and Muth (1969) 
hypothesized a concentric city that concentrated employment in the Central Business District (CBD). In 
recent years the urban spatial structure of large cities has seen a trend away the monocentric model.  

The reconfiguration process of employment location in a city has been verified through the analysis 
of  employment  location  and  land  use  patterns.  Both  point  towards  a  relocation  and  concentration  of 
employment in different centers other than the CBD. Those secondary centers are known as Subcenter 
Business District (SBD).  
Polycentricity  has  been  empirically  verified  in  several  studies  in  major  North  American  cities 
 
(Giuliano and Small, 1991; McMillen, 2001; Yang et al, 2019) and across Europe (Veneri, 2013; Krehl, 
2016; Mulicek and Maly, 2019). Recent trend has explored the urban configuration in developing countries, 
predominantly on Chinese municipalities (Yue et al, 2010; Lv et al, 2017; Xie et al, 2019). Nevertheless, 
little has been explored in other developing countries, particularly in Latin America (Fernandez-Maldonado 
et al, 2014; Belmiro, Rodrigues and Neto, 2016; Campos and Chagas, 2017). 
 
Further, the use of urban planning policies and their influence in promoting subcenters has been left 
aside in empirical work. In that sense, the city of Curitiba (Brazil) emerges as focal point in this analysis. 
The Transit Oriented Development (TOD) policies developed since the 1970’s that implemented the Bus 
Rapid Transit (BRT) system in combination with land-use patterns reshaped the city’s landscape.   

Also, within the country’s economy, Curitiba plays an important role. The city is ranked as the fifth 
municipality that most contributes to the country’s GDP with 1.40% overall3. Further, is the eighth largest 
city in Brazil, with 1.917.185 million residents4.  

The primary focus of the present study is to assess whether the city of Curitiba has employment 
subcenters. Also, to which extent do subcenters influence in the attraction of employment in comparison to 
the CBD. Further, the TOD policies adopted since the 70’s that reshaped the city structure in recent years 
might be related to those subcenters, locating in close proximity to the main BRT lines. Further, theoretical 
work acknowledges the commute patterns of employees in accordance to the location of their residences 
and  work.  Ultimately,  it  will  be  explored  the  commuting  flows  of  employees  to  the  CBD  and  the 
employment subcenters. At this stage it will be investigated to which extent the SBDs are employment 
attractors within the other municipalities of the RIT. 

It also must be stressed that other studies focus in the analysis of polycentric urban structures within 
a metropolitan region, which accounts for a larger area of analysis (Giuliano and Small, 1991; McMillen, 
2001; Krehl, 2016). The greater area of investigation might absorb a municipality’s CBD as an employment 
subcenter when compared to the region’s most prominent employment concentration. Further, Curitiba is 
the main employment municipality of the region, attracting workers of the nearby cities. As it was pointed 
in the aforementioned paragraph, our focus is in Curitiba and the relationships between the core of the BRT 
network system and the city’s employment subcenters.  

The  present  work  contributes  to  the  empirical  research  of  polycentric  structures  in  the  Latin 
American context while examining a major Brazilian city. It also adds to the literature over estimation 
procedures in order to assess employment subcenters. Further, the analysis of Curitiba, which has a strong 
urban planning culture, sheds light into the relationship of TOD and polycentricity.  

Including  this  brief  introduction,  this  paper  is  organized  into  six  sections.  The  second  section 
explores the city of Curitiba and its TOD policies. The third section is a literature review followed by the 
identification strategy. The fourth, explores the estimation procedure. The fifth, displays the results and 
discussion. Lastly, the conclusion.

2. CURITIBA AND THE TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT  

This rapid growth spurt experienced by Curitiba between 1950 and 1980 that doubled its population 
influenced the proposal of a new master plan in 1966. This new urban policy was a result of the problems 
that were already being faced by the populational growth. This plan focused on public transportation, road 
system and mixed land use. The main goal was to integrate mixed land use patterns to the road system and 
the public transportation system5.  

According  to  Rabinovitch  (1996,  p.  53)  the  key  principles  involving  the  Master  Plan  were: 
decongestion  of  the  central  area;  infrastructure  development;  economic  support  to  urban  development; 
demographic control and management; imposing a linear urban growth trend. Furthermore, the plan had in 
view  the  creation  of  a  specific  neighborhood  to  accommodate  industrial  venues,  the  Industrial  City  of 
Curitiba (henceforth, CIC). Located approximately ten kilometers from the CBD6.  

Within the core of the plan is the zoning regulations that intertwine between the transit network. As 
shown  by  Shertzer  et  al  (2018)  and  Twinam  (2018),  land  use  regulations  have  a  stronger  impact  in 
determining  the  location  of  commercial  and  industrial  activities  in  the  urban  space  rather  than  the 
transportation network. In the case of Curitiba, the zoning restrictions are strongly related to the public 
transportation  system.  Therefore,  it  is  expected  that  there  is  a  relationship  between  the  distribution  of 
employment in the city and it’s TOD policy. 

According  to  Dou  et  al  (2016)  a  Transit-Oriented  Development  (TOD)  must  include  three 
dimensions: density, diversity and design. Curitiba’s urban development contemplates those three aspects.  
The transportation system was initially conceptualized in four main axes, north-south and east-west. 
A fifth axis was later incorporated in the southeast direction. These five axes are the main core of the Bus 
Rapid Transit (BRT) network. The lack of available resources and investments faced at the time hindered 
the construction of a subway system. The solution was to build a similar surface transport system, which 
culminated in the BRT network.  

Another key point of the policy is the trinary road system developed around each axe. The main 
road consists of segregated bus lanes traveling in opposite directions followed by slow speed traffic lanes 
and parallel parking. One block away from the main road in are high speed car lanes, each road travelling 
on different ways.  

The five main axes were also envisioned to accommodate populational growth through mixed land-
use policy while also promoting high-density populational areas.  Within the main road it was authorized 
to build high-rise constructions.  In the first two floors of those buildings it is encouraged their use in 
economic activities. Further, the height of the buildings decay within distance from the main road.  

The high populational concentration within the main axes also contributes to make the BRT network 
self-financing, once it’s expected that the residents living nearby will chose the public transportation as 
their preferred modal7.  

Furthermore, another key issue was the road hierarchy promoted by the BRT network. The arterial 
roads were the five main axis and core of the system. Followed by the priority roads whose purpose was to 
link the streets of the arterial axis. Finally, the collector streets accounted for general purposes and to 
connect the structural roads to neighborhoods without reaching the CBD (RABINOVITCH, 1996).  

The design around the transportation system also plays a fundamental role. In the areas that were 
already developed the plan redesigned the surrounding locations in order to enable the full potential of the 
area8. The undeveloped areas were envisioned to accommodate the expansion of the BRT network and 
populational growth taking into consideration the design around neighboring areas 9. The design around 

 

5 Curitiba has had international recognition for the Bus Rapit Transit (BRT) and the efforts around its development since the 
1970s when the first bus lines started to operate and the incentives towards mixed land-use pattern alongside it. For further 
references see Cervero and Dai, 2014; Duarte and Ultramari, 2012; and Khayesi and Amekudzi, 2011. 
6 The previous Master Plan developed in 1941 and 1943 differed in the transportation strategy when compared to the 1966 Master 
Plan, nevertheless the former plan also had contemplated the development of employment subcenters. See Macedo (2004). 
7 The work developed by Duarte and Ultramari (2012) show evidence of the contrary.  
8 See Rabinovitch (1996) for more details.  
9 Cervero and Dai (2014, p. 132) cite the problems faced in the implementation of the BRT system in Bogotá (Colombia) where 
“aligning corridors in mostly economically stagnant zones that were largely built out has suppressed land development”. They 
also point that “siting BRT in busy roadway medians, which limited land supplies for leveraging TOD and resulted in mostly 
 
3 

the main road is key to the success of the mixed-land use and expansion of the CBD economic activities to 
the remainder of the city through the transport axes.  

Throughout the years the Master Plan suffered several modifications, but the plan’s core established 
in 1966 still serves as the main guideline in the urban planning and development of Curitiba. Therefore, the 
1966 Master Plan was not only conceived to promote an efficient public system transportation. It is a plan 
that has been implemented over the last fifty years that redesigned the shape of the city through land-use 
policy.

Nowadays, the BRT network expanded to other municipalities around Curitiba. The adjacent cities 
embraced by the BRT including Curitiba are known as the Integrated Transport Region (henceforth, RIT). 
As it is exposed in Table 1, Curitiba concentrates most of the formal employment and economically active 
population in the RIT.  

Moreover, Curitiba is the main economic driving force within the region, as it can be seen by the 
difference between the number of formal employees and the economically active population in the other 
municipalities  of  the  RIT.  Therefore,  it  should  be  expected  that  employees  that  reside  in  neighboring 
locations commute to Curitiba to work.  

3. FROM THE MONOCENTRIC TO POLYCENTRIC URBAN PATTERN 

The Alonso-Mills-Muth Model analyses a concentric city where a predetermined single location 
concentrates the firms, the Central Business District (CBD). Notwithstanding, Alonso (1964), Mills (1967) 
and  Muth  (1969)  acknowledged  the  possibility  that  cities  could  incorporate  other  concentrations  of 
employment within its limits besides the CBD10.  
 
A  theoretical  microeconomic  model  proposed  by  Fujita  and  Ogawa  (1982)  argue  in  favor  of 
different urban pattern equilibria that comprises a polycentric city. Further, the literature review by Berry 
and Kim (1993) and Anas, Arnot and Small (1998)11 sheds light to the polycentric urban pattern. Both 

 

unattractive pedestrian environments immediate to stations”. Those problems were not faced in Curitiba once the policy was 
developed to accommodate future populational expansion. 
10 Moses and Golstein (1973) indicate the modification that Muth (1969) made to his model in order to incorporate smaller 
centers of employment located in the residential area. However, they are considered to small and have no effect on prices or land 
area occupied to exert any influence over space. Likewise, Mills (1967) cites an example of shopping centers and their possibility 
to exhibit increasing returns to scale sufficient enough to hinder housing from an area. Although, this force is not enough to be 
defined as a central location. But considering this possibility in the model would complicate its solution. 
11 The work of Anas, Arnot and Small (1998) comprises a section describing the historic conditions of the urban structure in the 
United States.

recurring urban pattern in major American cities.

The work empirical research of Shukla and Wadell (1991) and Wadell and Shukla (1993) focus on 
the analysis of land-use patterns to assess the presence of employment subcenters within the urban space 
for  the  Dallas-Fort  Worth  region.  Even  so,  they  were  able  to  determine  that  the  region  has  several 
subcenters.  

Several studies developed a methodological approach to determine employment subcenters within 
the urban context. Their focus shifted towards the analysis of employment rather than land-use patterns in 
order to determine SBDs.  

The study of McDonald (1987) proposes an empirical method to identify employment subcenters. 
In  order  to  address  the  issue,  he  determines  that  local  peaks  in  either  gross  employment  density  or 
employment-population ratio can determine subcenters. Simplifying, a site can only be considered as an 
employment subcenter if the employment-population ratio or gross employment density doesn’t decline the 
further a location is to the CBD.  

Further, gross employment density and the employment-population ratio are calculated considering 
the employment in manufacturing and the total employment in each location. The local peaks occur when 
the indicator for a particular site exceeds the value of the contiguous observations on at least one of the two 
categories. 

The proposed identification of subcenters by McDonald (1987) has several issues. In the case of the 
gross densities his calculations are subject to tract sensitivity once the total areas of each zone and the 
contiguous zones, which the densities are compared to, might vary. Also, if the choice of contiguity zones 
is modified, the results might differ as well. Further, his procedure is not subject to statistical testing in 
order to assess the subcenters significance. 

The  procedure  of  Giuliano  and  Small  (1991)  to  determine  subcenter  candidates  is  quite 
straightforward  and  replicable  in  other  study  regions.  They  define  an  employment  center  as  a  set  of 
contiguous zones that share a common boundary of least a quarter of a mile. Each zone has to have a 
minimum total gross employment density of ten employees per acre. Also, all the zones combined to form 
the subcenter must have at least 10.000 employees. The zones that do not meet the minimum density per 
acre or the minimum number of total employees are not classified as an employment center.

The  procedure  of  Giuliano  and  Small  (1991)  to  determine  subcenter  candidates  is  quite

the subcenter must have at least 10.000 employees. The zones that do not meet the minimum density per 
acre or the minimum number of total employees are not classified as an employment center.  

Nevertheless, their choice for the cutoffs is discretionary. As it is mentioned in their study, the total 
employment in a cluster is reduced in order to keep the CBD of other three counties significant. Further, 
the study of Cervero and Wu (1998) also use density cutoffs of seven workers per acre and 9.500 workers 
in contiguous tracts for the San Francisco Bay Area. According to McMillen (2001) and Redfearn (2007), 
the arbitrariness involved in the choice of values for the thresholds might be due to previous knowledge of 
the area studied. 

Another problem that arises from the proposed method is that the further a site locates from the 
CBD the lower its employment density. Thus, the minimum density per acre and total employment per 
center are difficult to achieve. This difficulty is further enhanced by their use of census tracts. Therefore, 
their methodology fails to detect employment concentrations in distant areas of the CBD and those sites 
that represent a local peak in comparison to the surrounding area. Taking into consideration that most of 
the employment in an urban area is not concentrated, rather dispersed, choosing such criteria favors the 
identification of SBDs closer to the CBD. The comparison made by Redfearn (2007) between results of the 
procedures of Giuliano and Small (1991) and McMillen (2001) confirms the previous affirmation. 

The  work  developed  by  Craig  and  Ng  (2001)  tries  to  remove  the  high  degree  of  subjectivity 
pertained in the studies of McDonald (1987) and Giuliano and Small (1991). They use a non-parametric 
employment density quantile splines regression.  

The focus of their procedure relies on the analysis on the probability distribution of the observations 
on the top quintile of the density function. According to the authors this is an advantage since they aim at 
the median and not the mean of the distribution. Another gain by their procedure is the use of a non-
parametric approach when compared to the linear estimation of parametric models that would possibly 
disregard subcenters.  

The employment density function estimates the logarithm of the employment density of a census 
tract  conditioned  to  its  distance  from  the  CBD.  Since  the  distance  to  the  CBD  is  being  used  as  the 
explanatory variable this yields concentric circles around the CBD. Those rings that present an employment 
gradient greater than what would be expected12 have a subcenter. Further, they choose the sites with the 
highest employment13 density within that ring as the SBD.  

The procedure proposed by Craig and Ng (2001) allows for statistical testing and since it is a non-
parametric  approach  it  captures  the  high  employment  density  areas  in  comparison  to  their  neighbors. 
Allowing the parameters to vary also takes into account possible geographical restrictions. Nevertheless, 
their method can only assess rings with high employment density gradients, it cannot determine specific 

 

12 According to Craig and Ng (2001, p. 102) the ring that present an “employment gradient greater than what would be expected 
from a smoothly declining density quantile spline and use the variation in the gradient to define the location of an employment 
center”.  
13 Craig and Ng (2001, p.102) mention that “using the upper quantile spline, however, greatly increases the chances the chosen 
point is one that influences the top quantile spline, and so is consistent with finding an employment concentration”.

sites as subcenter candidates. In order to so, within those rings that have gradient peaks they choose the 
census tracts with the highest employment density. 

The methodology proposed by McMillen (2001) tries to identify subcenters that can be applied to 
different cities without the use of threshold values and prior knowledge of the specificities of the city. His 
two-stage semi-parametric procedure identifies statistically significant sharp local rises in the employment 
density while conditioning to the distance from the CBD. His methodology is also suited for different units 
of  analysis  and  takes  into  consideration  the  possibility  that  the  distance  from  the  CBD  may  influence 
variations in the employment density.   

The  methodology  proposed  by  Redfearn  (2007)  determines  employment  subcenters  through 
nonparametric regression. His main goal was to determine employment concentrations that are significantly 
higher than the neighboring areas. In his work he also considers the extent of subcenters.  

While analyzing the census tracts of the greater Los Angeles area he aggregates them in small 
subsamples that do not alter the employment density structure of the region. In the first step, he estimates 
two Locally Weighted Regressions (LWR) for employment density using a 24% window size and a tricube 
kernel weight14 considering as the independent variables the North-South and East-West directions.  

The highest points in the first step are considered to be candidate subcenters. In the second step he 
analyzes the tracts that are inside the local maxima previously estimated. Redfearn (2007) considers that 
local employment density around each maximum to determine the contour lines of the candidate subcenter 
in a way to approximate the resemblance of the shape of the area estimated in the first step. They are then 
analyzed through an iterative selection of a group of partitions of neighboring tracts located around the 
local maximum.  

For each maxima another LWR is estimated and those tracts that are considered to be part of the 
subcenter receive the values estimated by the LWR and, those outside, the average value of the employment 
density in the area. The partitions that are considered to be the best fit are those that have the lowest sum 
of squared residuals. Further, for each partition there are other partitions within that minimize the average 
between the Akaike and Schwartz Information Criterion. The test for significance for the subcenters is 
taken through a bootstrapped difference-in means test. 

Redfearn (2007) compares the results in his model with the ones of McMillen (2001) for the greater 
Los Angeles area. He states that McMillen’s (2001) methodology finds employment subcenters of any 
given significance throughout the entire region the results of McMillen’s (2001) estimations leads to the 
most significant employment subcenters in the highly urbanized areas of Los Angeles.  

Nevertheless,  Redfearn’s  (2007)  methodology  has  different  discretionary  choices,  as  in  the 
aggregation of tracts prior to the first step. Further, in the second step the choice of employment density to 
determine the contour lines of the subcenters estimated in the first step are also discretionary. Lastly, other 
problems in the estimations such as multicollinearity are not mentioned to be solved for.  

The works of McMillen (2001) and Redfearn (2007) sheds light in the problems faced while using 
density cutoff values and the traditional parametric negative exponential estimation in order to identify 
employment  subcenter.  Both  agree  in  the  sense  the  model  specification  should  be  nonparametric, 
accounting  for  variations  in  the  urban  area  that  influence  employment  location.  Thus,  the  literature 
searching to identify employment subcenters has reached a consensus in the model specification, the use 
of nonparametric models.  

Therefore, the estimation procedure proposed by McMillen (2001) appears to be the most suited to 
assess subcenters15 within the highly urbanized area of Curitiba. The proposed methodology is readily

4. DATA AND ESTIMATION PROCEDURE  

In the present study, the presence of employment subcenter within Curitiba’s urban space will be 

determined through the two-stage semi-parametric approach developed by McMillen (2001).  

Considering that the analysis in this study relies on spatial distribution of the employment density, 
first is necessary to georeference the employment through the city. Using the data provided for the year of 
2010 by the Brazilian Ministry of Employment (MTE) which conducts an annual report at the firm16 level, 
known as RAIS, gathering socioeconomic17 data of their formal employees18.  

The data was narrowed to the number of formal employees registered in December 31st and the 
firms’ ZIP codes, which enables the georefencing of the employees to determine employment density. The 
latter  was  possible  through  the  streets  network  shapefile  provided  by  IPPUC  (Instituto  de  Pesquisa  e 
Planejamento Urbano de Curitiba) that contains the ZIP codes of all streets in Curitiba.  

The  initial  data  provided  138.094  firms.  After  the  removal  of  companies  that  had  no  formal 
employees, that closed throughout the year and those that provided human resources to other firms19 it 
remained 50.497 firms. Further, public employees were not taken into consideration. Nevertheless, formal 
employees at public offices were considered. The initial data at the firm level provided 658.937 formal 
employees, given the aforementioned considerations, 586.021 employees were georeferenced. 

The georeferencing of the data was enabled by the street-level data of Curitiba provided it had the 
ZIP codes of each street. The firm-level data also had the ZIP codes of each companies located in the city. 
The merge between the two datasets allowed the georeferencing of the firms.  
The spatial location of each firm allowed the georeferencing of the employees since key variables facilitated 
the merge of the firm- and employee-level data, thus matching each individual to their workplace.  

The firm’s employment was georeferenced using grid cells of one kilometer by one kilometer20. 
This removes possible tract sensitivity when using the census tracts as McDonald (1987), Giuliano and 
Small (1991) and McMillen (2001). The study of Krehl (2016) analyzes employment subcenters through 
McMillen’s (2001) procedure also employing grid cells. The methodology proposed in McMillen (2001) 
allows for different units of analysis and the use of grid cells should not cause any impact in future results. 
Therefore, the employment density is the number of employees per square kilometers.  
 
The first stage of the procedure developed by McMillen (2001) serves as benchmark for the number 
of subcenter candidates. In this step, the procedure uses a non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression 
(LWR) to smooth the natural logarithm of employment density (yi) over the distance to the CBD (DCBDi). 
The use of the LWR contributes to identify rises in the employment density function considering only 
observations that are close to the unit of analysis. Also, it accounts for the difference in the employment 
density gradients through the area studied.  

This initial smooth is also efficient to remove possible sensitivity of the results caused by tract size. 
The method developed uses a large window size, the nearest 50% of observations of a given site i are 
attributed a weight. The further an observation is from the site i, smaller its weight. This large window size 
leads to a smoother employment density estimate, allowing to identify the sites that have significantly 
positive residuals, that is, outliers. These sites are possible subcenter candidates.    

 

16 As mentioned, the data is collected at the firm level. In the case of a firm with multiple production plants, franchises or offices 
that are in a different address or facility the data is recorded separately even though they belong to the same company.  
17 RAIS collects data for the following information: number of employees in December 31st; employees admitted and dismissed 
according to their gender, years of education, time employed, their wages and nationality; the data is also available according to 
the business occupation and sector; the firms’ data is also disaggregated according to country region, state and municipality 
(IBGE, 2019).  
18 According to the methodology proposed in RAIS formal employees are considered those that have their job information in 
their employment/work card, public employees, temporary workers with a predetermined contract expiration and single workers 
contracted through syndicates (IBGE, 2019). 
19 The firms classified in the ISIC (2008) at the three-digit level as 783 descripted as “Other human resources provision” were 
removed provided that the employees provide services to other firms. Therefore, their workplace is not at the provided address 
by the firm. 
20 Using a grid cell of 1km2 is not expected to influence the results of the estimation since the city of Curitiba has a north-south 
extension of 35km and east-west extension of 20 km (PMC, 2019).

𝑦(=𝑔(𝐷𝐶𝐷𝐵()   

In this step, McMillen (2001) uses the distance between the centroid of grid cell i to the CBD21 as 

the explanatory variable. The LWR regression in the first step is: 
 

 

                         

(1) 

 
 
The subcenter candidates are sites that exceed the smoothed employment with residuals that are 
significantly greater than zero at a five percent significance level22. In order to avoid multicollinearity when 
several sites are in close proximity, McMillen (2001) narrows the candidates to those that have the highest 
residuals within a three-mile radius, approximately five kilometers. As the author mentions, this radius is 
arbitrary, in the present work it will be used a three-kilometer radius23.  
 
Until this moment it has been identified possible subcenter candidates through local rises in the 
employment density function. However, this first step does not identify if those sites have a statistically 
significant  effect  over  the  outline  of  the  employment  density  function.  The  second  step  uses  a 
semiparametric regression to determine the significance of the subcenter candidates obtained in the first 
step, as it follows: 
 

                    		𝑦(=	𝑔(𝐷𝐶𝐵𝐷()+	∑ 9𝛿;)𝐷()<;+	𝛿=)𝐷()>+𝑢(

@)A;

      (2) 

   

The third term in equation (2) estimates the distance between a subcenter candidate site i and a site 
j in level (Dij) and inverse (Dij -1) form. The distance in level form displays those subcenters that have an 
effect over the region analyzed, while the inverse form displays subcenters that have a local impact in the 
employment density function. Hence, if δ1j is significant, a subcenter is called a local subcenter, and if δ2j 
is significant, a subcenter can be considered a global subcenter.  The last term, ui, is the error. The DCDBi 
continues to represent the distance between site i and the CBD.  

In the second step McMillen (2001) uses a highly flexible function to estimate DCDBi. As the author 
indicates, it can be used the LWR, cubic splines or a kernel procedure. In his work it was chosen a Fourier 
function. In our estimations we considered an LWR, the same as in the initial smooth. As Krehl (2016) 
points out, in the first step the focus was to estimate a smooth employment density, though, at this moment 
the focus is to approximate the employment density function the best way possible.  

A problem that might appear is multicollinearity when multiple distance variables are incorporated 
in the regression caused by a large amount of candidate subcenter sites. To solve this issue McMillen (2001) 
uses a stepwise procedure in order to determine the subcenter candidates. The estimated coefficients of 
both distance variables (level or inverse) are positive when the site is close to a subcenter. The subcenter 
distance variable that scores the lowest t-value is excluded, even if the variable is statistically significant. 
The smaller regression is then estimated. This procedure is repeated until all subcenter distance variables 
are statistically significant at the 20% confidence level. Then, the subcenter candidates are those sites that 
have positive coefficients on either one or both Dj and Dj -1 after the stepwise procedure is finished.  

Therefore, the procedure proposed by McMillen (2001) provides statistical criteria to analyze the 
presence of employment subcenters within a region. Nonetheless, this methodology overcomes ad hoc 
definitions  to  determine  the  presence  of  SBD  is  a  site  that  has  a  significant  impact  in  the  estimated 
employment density.  

McMilllen (2001) also searches to determine the extent to which a variable related to the proximity 
of a subcenter improves the goodness of fit of the logarithm of the employment density function related to 
the distance of the CBD. Therefore, he uses a gravity variable to represent the possible outcomes linked to 
the proximity of a subcenter.  
 

22 The significance level is: (yi - 𝑦B()/(𝜎B() > 1.96. Where 𝑦B( is the estimated ln-density of y at site i and 𝜎B( is the estimated standard

error for the prediction in site i.  
23 In McMillen’s (2001) work he analyzes metropolitan areas with large area (kilometers squared): Chicago (12,450.07), Dallas 
(15,415.61), Houston (16,871.183), Los Angeles (13,750.25), New Orleans (7,270.097) and San Francisco (11,046.3). In this 
study is only analyzed the data for the city of Curitiba, not taking into consideration nearby cities nor the metropolitan area.

context, the definition of density is referred to as the number of observations that are nearby. When applying 
the weight of the terms in their estimated densities, therefore placing less weight on remote subcenters, 
which tend to be surrounded by grids with little or no employment.  

The estimated regression with the inclusion of the gravity variable is:  
 

 
 
The inclusion of the gravity variable contributes to assess whether the CBD is the main contributor 
to the spatial distribution of the densities in the studied area. Hence, the inclusion of this variable contributes 
to acknowledge whether the CBD is the main driving force in attracting employment in the urban context.  
 
Furthermore, the data available for the Origin-Destination (OD) survey for 2017 will be used to 
analyze commuting flows of workers. The weight variable is not available and, therefore, each individual 
is attributed the same weight. This might hinder possible inferences. Nevertheless, at this moment the 
analysis will be restricted to individuals that commute from other municipalities to Curitiba’s CBD or 
SBDs. In order to do so, we restrict our analysis only for the morning commuters that are travelling from 
their residence to their workplace. 
 
In order to match the zoning system of the OD survey and the employment grid cells we considered 
in  our  analysis  all  the  individuals  that  worked  in  the  zones  inside  (entirely  or  not)  a  cell  that  had  an 
employment subcenter. To analyze the commute between the zone of an individual’s residence and the 
SBD we created a straight line between the respective centroids.   
 
5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The grid cell considered as the CBD for Curitiba was the one that had the highest employment 
  
density. As it was expected, the CBD is located in the downtown area and in close proximity to the five 
main axes of the BRT network, as it is shown in Figure 3.  

In order to estimate the first step of the procedure the distance between the i-th observation to the 
CBD was measured. The results LWR estimation provided 180 subcenter candidates significant at the five 
percent level. The results for the initial smooth can be seen in Figure 2. Considering the large number of 
candidates, in order to avoid multicollinearity, it was applied the three-kilometer radius to each observation 
with the highest residuals. After this removal, the number of subcenter candidates lowered to 25.  

Further, the stepwise procedure eliminated more 15 observations, resulting in the final list of ten 
subcenters. Out of those SBDs, six were considered as Global and four as Local Subcenters. The location 
within the urban space to the main axes of the BRT system and feeder lines are shown in Figure 3.  

It worth analyzing separately subcenter 402. As it can be seen in Figure 3, the SBD is surrounded 
by low density tracts, which consequently turns his density significantly higher than the neighbors. Also, 
his density is significantly lower when compared to the other global subcenters. As it can also be seen in 
Figure  3,  center  402  has  limited  interaction  to  the  BRT  network.  Therefore,  despite  being  statistically 
significant, this subcenters appears to be spurious.  

The results for the two-step estimation show that the SBDs concentrate a considerable amount of 
employment. The firm’s specialization in each grid cell were classified considering a three-digit level firm 
classification of the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) shown in Table 2. As it would 

 

10 

be expected, the CBD embraces several firms. The largest firm of the center employs 1.391workers and 
only concentrates 0,04% of the employment in the region.

Nevertheless, most of the global subcenters are specialized in the service sector. Only one of those 
centers is in the industrial sector. Also, two SBDs out of the five relate to transportation activities. And the 
highest concentration of firm’s employees within the grids are in those two transportation firms.  
It should be mentioned that the procedure of McMillen (2001) does not capture the extent of the 
 
subcenters,  whether,  high  employment  density  nodes.  When  comparing  his  procedure  with  the  ones 
proposed  by  Giuliano  and  Small  (1998)  and  Redfearn  (2007),  both  estimate  the  size  of  the  SBDs, 
accounting for a higher proportion of employment. Hence, it is expected that the share of employment from 
the McMillen (2001) procedure within the subcenters is significantly lower.

In the case of the local SBDs, the highest employers in the grid concentrates more employment 
when compared to global subcenters. Further, two SBDs are specialized in the construction sector, one in 
retail and the other on the provision of public utilities. As it can be seen in Figure 3, three subcenters locate 
near one another, but within the 3-kilometer radius to avoid multicollinearity. 

Focusing  on  the  individual  level  data  it  can  be  observed  a  strong  correlation  between  years  of 
education and income within the SBDs. The subcenter 432 has the highest proportion of employees that 
abandoned high school and the lowest that did graduate high school. Also, it is the second to last in the 
proportion of workers that have a bachelor’s degree. Therefore, as it can be seen in Table 3, this SBD has 
the lowest income of all subcenters.

The SBD with the highest income not only has the most employees with bachelor’s degree but also 
the highest age average within all subcenters. Given these two statements this result should be expected, 
confirming the relationship between years of education and experience. It is worth mentioning that the 
average income in this grid is two times greater than the average for the CBD. Further, it should be taken 
into consideration the level of education within all SBDs, revealing that only two of those subcenters do 
not have a proportion of high school graduates higher than 40%.  

Moreover,  when  considering  the  high  school  graduates  and  those  with  bachelor’s  degree,  the 
proportion of employees with high level of human capital within the SBDs are over 55%. Except in the two 
cases mentioned in the previous paragraph. 

Taking into consideration only the mains axes of the BRT network, four subcenters are located 
within a close range of the network. While also considering the main feeder lines of the network only two 
subcenters are not located adjacent to the transportation network. Nevertheless, local subcenters 79 and 432 
are located the farthest from the network, as it can be seen in Table 4.

Therefore,  as  it  was  expected,  given  the  results  in  Shertzer  et  al    (2018),  Twinam  (2018)  and 
Redfearn (2007) there is a strong relationship between the TOD policy and the land use regulations which 
lie behind it in the promotion of employment subcenters within Curitiba’s urban space and their close 
proximity to the BRT network.  

Analyzing the commute flows towards the CBD, it would be expected that since Curitiba and its 
CBD concentrates most of the employment within the region, that individuals that reside in surrounding 
cities commute daily to the region. The evidence shown in Figure 4 support this view.

The pattern for the Global SBDs is similar to those observed in the CBD, with a strong outreach to 
nearby and outer municipalities. Furthermore, it can be seen that the majority of the interviewed individuals 
residing in different cities, do locate near the SBD. In the case of the Local SBDs it can be observed that 
there is an outreach to other municipalities of the RIT but not as strong as the Global ones.  

Furthermore,  the  use  different  years  across  the  databases  in  the  study  enables  to  infer  if  the 
subcenters estimated for 2010 are still relevant in the influx of workers. In this case, the only subcenter that 
draws a low number of workers in 2017 was node 402, as seen in Figure 5. This was the only subcenter 
with the predominant employer in the retail sector. This suggests that this SBD no longer exists.  

Finally, the inclusion of the gravity variable in the model searches to determine whether the CBD 
is the main employment attractor within the urban context. At this moment, the analysis returns its focus 
exclusively to Curitiba.  

The reported coefficients for the estimation including gravity leads us to infer that the CBD is no 
longer determines the spatial trends in the employment densities within Curitiba. Further, the estimated 
coefficients for this case follow the same signals as those reported by McMillen (2001) for the cities whose 
CBD no longer are the main driving force in employment location.

6. CONCLUSION 
 
This paper intended to determine whether Curitiba (Brazil) has employment subcenters within its 
urban context and how do they relate to the TOD policies that have been developed and implemented since 
the 1970’s. Further, it was also explored whether the CBD still is the most influential location in the spatial 
trends of employment density. 
Finally, it was also investigated the outreach of the subcenters to other municipalities comprising the RIT. 
In order to do so, the chosen estimation procedure was the one proposed by McMillen (2001). This 
methodology was preferred because it relies mostly in statistical criteria in order to determine employment 
subcenters, removing possible ad hoc definitions. The opposite of the proposed procedure by Giuliano and 
Small (1991).  

The results confirm the initial hypothesis. Therefore, Curitiba is indeed a polycentric city with the 
presence of nine subcenters. Out of those, four are considered to be local subcenters and the six remainder 
subcenters are global. 

Further, the inclusion of the gravity variable sheds light to the fact that Curitiba’s CBD is no longer 
the  main  determinant  of  the  employment  location  in  the  urban  context.  Therefore,  the  employment 
subcenters can be considered to be influential in the attraction of employment in the city. Further, the spatial 
distribution of these subcenters is highly correlated to the BRT network, evidencing the role of TOD urban 
planning policy in shaping the polycentric structure. 
 
The analysis of the OD survey for the year of 2017 show that the CBD has more capillarity to other 
municipalities within the RIT when comparing to the SBDs. Nevertheless, the Global SBDs have a higher 
outreach to other outer locations in comparison to the Local subcenters. Nevertheless, the unavailability of 
the weights hinders a deeper comprehension of the commuting flows within the RIT.

Furthermore, the policies developed through the BRT network, which promoted the development 
of subcenters, in consonance with the results in the model that included the gravity variable, show that the 
presence of SBDs in Curitiba is not a phenomenon, but rather a trend.  

Considering the results when including the gravity variable, further research should investigate the 
preferred transportation modal according to wage and other socioeconomic variables. In order to do so, 
estimating adequate weights for the OD survey should be necessary.
