Abstract: This paper sets forth a classical model of economic growth in which the distribution of 
income  features  the  possibility  of  profit  sharing  with  workers,  as  firms  choose  periodically 
between two labor-extraction compensation strategies. Firms choose to compensate workers with 
a base wage or a share of profits on top of  this base wage. In accordance with robust empirical 
evidence,  labor  productivity  in  profit-sharing  firms  is  higher  than  labor  productivity  in  non-
sharing firms. The frequency distribution of labor-extraction compensation strategies and average 
labor  productivity  in  the  population  of  firms  is  evolutionarily  time-varying.  The  paper  derives 
two main results which carry relevant theoretical and policy implications. First, heterogeneity in 
labor-extraction  compensation  strategies  across  firms  can  be  a  stable  long-run  equilibrium. 
Second, in the long-run equilibrium, a higher frequency of profit-sharing firms can yield a higher 
net profit share in income and thereby higher rates of net profit and economic growth. 

Keywords: profit sharing, income distribution, economic growth, evolutionary dynamics. 
 
Resumo: Este artigo propõe um modelo clássico de crescimento econômico em que a distribuição 
de renda conta com a possibilidade de compartilhamento de lucros com os trabalhadores, pois as 
firmas escolhem periodicamente entre duas estratégias de remuneração para extração de trabalho. 
As  firmas  escolhem  remunerar  os  trabalhadores  com  um  salário  base  ou  com  uma  participação 
nos lucros em adição a esse salário base. Conforme evidência empírica robusta, a produtividade 
do trabalho é maior nas firmas que adotam compartilhamento de lucros que naquelas que não o 
adotam. A distribuição de frequência das estratégias de remuneração para extração de trabalho e 
da produtividade média do trabalho na população de firmas varia ao longo do tempo de maneira 
evolucionária. O artigo deriva dois principais resultados com relevantes implicações teóricas e de 
política  pública.  Primeiro,  a  heterogeneidade  nas  estratégias  de  remuneração  para  extração  de 
trabalho entre as firmas pode ser um equilíbrio de longo prazo estável. Segundo, no equilíbrio de 
longo prazo, uma maior frequência de firmas que adotam compartilhamento de lucros pode gerar 
uma maior parcela líquida dos lucros na renda e, por meio disso, de taxas mais elevadas de lucro 
líquido e crescimento econômico.

1. Introduction 

Employee profit sharing has experienced an increasing (even if fluctuating) popularity in 
several advanced economies in the last few decades (D’Art and Turner, 2004, Kruse et al., 2010). 
Meanwhile, from a longer-term perspective, there have been rising and falling waves of interest 
in employee profit-sharing schemes since their inception in the 19th century (Mitchell et al.,1990, 
D’Art and Turner, 2006, Blasi, et al., 2013). 

The  main  motivation  behind  a  firm’s  offering  of  profit  sharing  to  workers  is  that 
connecting workers’ earnings to the profit performance of the firm is believed in theory to induce 
workers  to  increase  commitment,  effort  and  other  attitudes  leading  to  their  higher  productivity. 
Indeed,  attitude  surveys  find  that  employers  and  employees  usually  believe  that  profit  sharing 
helps improve firm performance in several dimensions (Weitzman and Kruse, 1990, and Blasi et 
al., 2010). 

Other  compensation  mechanisms  through  which  workers’  earnings  depend  on  the 
performance of the firm (or work group) are gain sharing, employee ownership and stock options. 
Profit-sharing  plans  themselves  vary  considerably,  and  some  major  ways  in  which  they  differ 
concern  what  is  shared  (e.g.,  total  profits  or  profits  above  some  target  or  threshold  level),  how 
and when sharing is  made (e.g., in  cash or  company stocks, in  a deferred or non-deferred way) 
and  with  whom  sharing  is  made  (e.g.,  directly  to  workers  or  to  some  workers’  retirement  or 
pension plan). Yet, there is survey evidence that non-deferred and in cash profit sharing is ranked 
first by employees as a motivation device (Blasi et al., 2010). 

There  is  considerable  empirical  evidence  that  profit  sharing  raises  labor  productivity. 
Although the estimated magnitude of the productivity gain varies from study to study, it is often 
non-negligible. Weitzman and Kruse (1990) apply meta-analysis to sixteen studies to find that the 
productivity  gain  of  profit  sharing  is  positive  at  infinitesimal  significance  levels.  Doucouliagos 
(1995)  applies  meta-analysis  to  forty-three  studies  to  find  that  profit  sharing  is  positively 
associated  with  productivity.  Cahuc  and  Dormont  (1997)  use  French  data  to  find  that  profit 
sharing  firms  outperform  other  firms  in  productivity  and  profitability.  Conyon  and  Freeman 
(2004),  using  UK  data,  find  that  profit-sharing  firms  tend  to  outperform  other  firms  in 
productivity  and  financial  performance.  D’Art  and  Turner  (2004)  use  data  for  11  European 
countries  to  find  that  profit  sharing  is  positively  associated  with  productivity  and  profitability, 
while  Kim  (1998),  using  U.S.  data,  finds  that  albeit  profit  sharing  raises  labor  productivity, 
profits  do  not  rise,  as  gains  from  profit  sharing  are  cancelled  out  by  increased  labor  costs.  In  a 
field,  quasi-experimental  study,  Peterson  and  Luthans  (2006)  randomly  assigned  profit-sharing 
plans at three of twenty-one establishments within a U.S. firm, finding that labor productivity and 
profits rose in the profit-sharing establishments relative to the control group. 

Also motivated by the above empirical evidence, this paper sets forth a classical model of 
economic growth, in which the distribution of income can feature profit sharing with workers. In 
attempting to extract labor from labor power more effectively, firms can behave heterogeneously 
as regards the choice of compensation strategy. Firms choose to compensate workers with either 
only a conventional base wage or a share of profits on top of this conventional base wage. In line 
with  the  empirical  evidence  reported  above,  workers  in  profit-sharing  firms  have  a  higher 
productivity than their counterparts in non-sharing firms. Meanwhile, any observed heterogeneity 
in labor-extraction compensation strategies across firms and the resulting additional productivity 
gain  that  accrues  to  profit-sharing  firms  are  not  parametric  constants,  but  rather  co-evolve 
endogenously towards the long-run as driven by an evolutionary process. Therefore, our model is 
well fitted to explore possible explanations for evidence such as that U.K. firms switch modes of 
employee  compensation  frequently,  with  the  gross  changes  in  modes  (which  include  profit 
sharing) being far more numerous than the net  changes (which suggests that firms  have trouble 

 

1 

optimizing and that the transaction costs of switching are relatively low) (Bryson and Freeman, 
2010). 

Moreover,  we  explore  the  implications  of  the  coupled  dynamics  of  the  distribution  of 
labor-extraction  compensation  strategies  across  firms  and  the  additional  productivity  gain  that 
accrues to profit-sharing firms for the distribution of aggregate income between profits and wages 
and thereby capital accumulation and economic growth. Arguably, given the essential role of the 
functional distribution of income in the classical tradition, it is fitting to explore the implications 
of  profit  sharing  for  capital  accumulation  and  economic  growth  in  a  model  that  conforms  to 
essential tenets of this tradition.1 

The remainder of this paper is  organized  as follows. Section 2 describes the structure of 
the  model  and  investigates  its  behavior  in  the  short  run.  Section  3  explores  the  coupled 
evolutionary  dynamics  of  the  frequency  distribution  of  labor-extraction  compensation  modes 
across firms and the additional productivity gain that accrues to profit-sharing firms. This section 
also investigates the implications of such coupled evolutionary dynamics for income distribution 
and  thereby  capital  accumulation  and  economic  growth  in  the  long  run.  The  final  section 
summarizes the main conclusions reached along the way. 

2. Structure of the model and its behavior in the short run 

The  model  economy  is  closed  and  without  government  activities,  producing  a  single 
(homogeneous) good for both investment and consumption purposes. Production is carried out by 
a large (and fixed) population of firms, which combine two (physically homogeneous) factors of 
production,  capital  and  labor,  by  means  of  a  fixed-coefficient  technology.  Firms  produce  (and 
hire labor) without facing realization (or effective demand) constraints, thereby being able to sell 
profitably all its output production at the prevailing price level. However, the model is cast in real 
terms. 

In  attempting  to  extract  labor  from  labor  power  more  effectively,  an  individual  firm 
chooses periodically between two worker compensation strategies: it compensates workers with 
  (non-sharing  labor-extraction 
either  only  a  conventional  (or  subsistence)  base  wage 
compensation  strategy)  or  with  a  conventional  base  wage  and  a  share  of  profits 
 
(profit-sharing  labor-extraction  compensation  strategy).  In  a  given  period  there  is  a  proportion 
,  is 
composed by non-sharing (or type n) firms. In accordance with the empirical evidence on profit 
sharing  reported  in  the  preceding  section,  a  profit-sharing  firm  is  willing  to  play  such  labor-
extraction  compensation  strategy  because  the  resulting  labor  productivity  gain  is  strictly  higher 
than  otherwise.  Productivity  is  homogeneous  across  workers  in  firms  playing  a  given  worker 
compensation strategy. Since the conventional base wage is assumed to be the same under both 
labor-extraction compensation strategies, a worker hired by a sharing firm does receive a higher 

  of  profit-sharing  (or  type  s)  firms,  while  the  remaining  proportion, 

                                                           
1 From a mainstream (of New Keynesian variety) perspective, Weitzman (1985) claims that profit sharing 
can deliver full employment with low inflation. If part of workers’ total compensation is shared profits, so 
that  the  base  wage  is  lower,  the  marginal  cost  of  labor  is  lower  and  firms  will  be  willing  to  hire  more 
workers.  As  the  marked  up  price  is  lower,  a  real  balance  effect  creates  a  higher  aggregate  demand  and 
hence a higher desired output. Therefore, Weitzman (1985) implicitly sees involuntary unemployment as 
due to downward wage inflexibility (Davidson, 1986-87, Rothschild, 1986-87). In our model, the fraction 
of  profit-sharing  firms  and  the  average  labor  productivity  are  endogenously  time-varying.  Also,  we 
explore implications of profit sharing for growth performance in a classical model, in which the functional 
distribution of income plays a key role.

domain given by strictly positive profits for sharing firms.2 

To  keep  focus  on  the  dynamics  of  the  distribution  of  labor-extraction  compensation 
strategies  and  its  implications  for  the  functional  distribution  of  income  and  thereby  economic 
growth,  we  simplify  matters  by  assuming  that  the  conventional  base  wage, 
,  and  the  profit-
,  remain  constant  over  time.  The  distribution  of  labor-extraction 
sharing  coefficient, 
compensation strategies across firms, 
, which is given in the short run as a result from 
previous  dynamics,  changes  beyond  the  short  run  according  to  an  evolutionary  dynamic  (the 
replicator  dynamic).  In  the  short  run,  for  given  values  of  the  conventional  base  wage,  profit-
sharing  coefficient,  productivity  differential,  distribution  of  labor-extraction  strategies  and, 
therefore,  individual  and  average  profit  shares,  the  short-run  equilibrium  value  of  the  rate  of 
economic growth is determined. As the economy evolves towards the long-run, the co-evolution 
of the distribution of labor-extraction strategies and the labor productivity differential, by leading 
to  changes in  the  average share of profits, causes  changes in  the short-run equilibrium value of 
the rate of economic growth. 

Formally, we define the productivity differential as: 

(1) 

 

, 

where 

of type 

 denotes labor productivity in firms of type 

, 

 is total output of firms 

, and 

 is total employment of firms type 

. For simplicity, we normalize 

labor productivity in non-sharing firms, 

, to one, so that we obtain 

 in (1). As it turns 

out,  profit-sharing  firms  can  be  intuitively  described  as  firms  willing  to  bet  on  the  prospect  of 
attaining a productivity differential, 
, which is high enough to allow them to have a lower unit 
labor cost than non-sharing firms. At the end of the day a sharing firm expects such productivity 
differential to be high enough to allow it to have a higher net profit rate (i.e., net of shared profits) 
than a non-sharing firm. However, as explored in the next section, the resulting labor productivity 
differential may fall short of the level required for the profit-sharing bet to prove successful. 

 

Using (1), the total profits of sharing and non-sharing firms are, respectively: 

(2) 

and: 

(3) 

 

 

; 

, 

which  requires  further  assuming  that 

.  Using  (2)  and  (3),  the  shares  of  profit  in 

output of sharing and non-sharing firms in the short-run are given, respectively, by: 

(4) 

 

and: 

; 

                                                           
2  Empirical  evidence  shows  that  profit  sharing  has  a  meaningful  effect  on  worker  total  compensation 
(Kruse et al., 2010). In fact, Capelli and Neumark (2004) find that total labor costs exclusive of the sharing 
component  do  not  fall  significantly  in  pre/post  comparisons  of  firms  that  adopt  profit  sharing.  This 
suggests that profit sharing tends to come on top of, rather than in place of, a base wage.

. 

The profit share expression in (4) denotes the proportion of gross profits in the output of sharing 
firms, since an exogenously given fraction of such profits, given by 
, is shared with 
workers. Using (4), the net unit return of sharing firms in the short-run is given by: 

(6) 

 

, 

Using (5) and (6), the short-run value of the average net profit share can be expressed as: 

(7) 

 

. 

 
As  regards  capital  productivity,  to  keep  focus  on  the  main  issue  of  the  effect  of  profit 
sharing  on  the  rate  of  economic  growth,  we  simplify  matters  by  assuming  that  the  maximum 
output  that  can  be  produced  by  fully  utilizing  one  unit  of  capital, 
,  is  an  exogenously  given 
constant common to all firms: 

(8) 

 

where 

. 

, 

 is the output to capital ratio (and 

 is the total capital stock) of firms of type 

Using (2)-(5) and (8), the (gross) profit rates of sharing and non-sharing firms in the short 

run can then be expressed as follows: 

(9) 

 

and: 

(10) 

 

; 

. 

Using (6) and (9), the net profit rate of sharing firms in the short run is then given by: 

(11) 

 

. 

Therefore, using (10) and (11), the short run value of the average net profit rate can be expressed 
as: 

(12) 

 

. 

Therefore,  a  comparison  between  (7)  and  (12)  shows  that  the  average  net  profit  share  and  the 
average net profit rate always move in the same direction.

dynamics.3  

,  can  all  be  taken  as  predetermined  by  previous 

The  economy  is  inhabited  by  two  classes,  capitalists  who  own  the  firms  and  workers. 
Workers  provide  labor  and  earn  a  base  wage  income,  when  they  work  for  non-sharing  firms. 
Workers  in  sharing  firms  also  receive  a  share  of  the  latter’s  profit  income,  which  is  the  entire 
surplus  over  the  respective  base  wage  bill.  We  assume  that  workers’  total  compensation  is  all 
spent  on  consumption,  while  capitalists  homogeneously  save  a  fraction, 
,  of  their 
net  profit  income.  As  we  further  assume  that  capitalists  save  in  order  to  fully  finance  their 
investment  decisions,  it  follows  that  all  income  not  consumed  is  automatically  invested. 
Therefore, individual firms are able to sell all their production at the prevailing price level, so that 
aggregate  demand  will  adjust  to  remove  any  excess  aggregate  (and  individual)  supply  in  the 
goods  market.  In  short-run  goods  market  equilibrium,  therefore,  it  follows  that  aggregate 
investment, 

, is identically equal to net aggregate savings, 

. 

Using (8)-(11), the net aggregate savings as a proportion of the capital stock  at period 

 

can be expressed as follows: 

(13) 

. 

Thus, by substituting (13) in the goods market equilibrium identity given by 

, and 

assuming  for  simplicity  that  the  capital  stock  does  not  depreciate,  we  obtain  the  short-run 
equilibrium growth rate: 

(14) 

 

. 

Note that  the short-run equilibrium growth  rate depends on parametric constants  along with  the 
labor  productivity  differential, 
labor-extraction 

the  frequency  distribution  of 

,  and 

compensation  strategies, 

,  which  are  predetermined  in  the  short  run  and  co-evolve  in  the 

transition from the short to the long run (as described in the next section). Expectedly, in light of 
the classical nature of the macroeconomic dynamic, the short-run equilibrium growth rate varies 
positively  with  the  common  saving  propensity  of  capitalists  and  the  average  profit  share  in 
income.  This  is  so  because  economic  growth  is  driven  by  capital  accumulation  from  the 
aggregate saving of capitalists. 

3. Behavior of the model in the long run 

In  the  long  run  we  assume  that  the  short-run  equilibrium  value  of  the  rate  of  economic 
growth is always attained, with the economy moving towards the long run due to changes in the 
 and 
aggregate stock of capital, 

, coming from changes in the individual stocks of capital, 

, the supply of available  labor, 

, the labor productivity differential, 

, and the  frequency 

distribution  of  labor-extraction  compensation  strategies, 
that  can  be  produced  by  fully  utilizing  one  unit  of  capital  is  an  exogenously  given  constant 

.  However,  as  the  maximum  output 
 

                                                           
3 As in the next section we explore the behavior of the economy in the transition from the short to the long 
run,  thereafter  we  attach  a  subscript 
  to  the  short-run  value  of  all  variables  (be  they  endogenous  or 
predetermined).

. Meanwhile, to sharpen focus on the 

coupled  dynamics  of  the  frequency  distribution  of  labor-extraction  compensation  strategies  and 
the  productivity  differential  as  state  variables,  we  further  assume  that  the  supply  of  available 
labor grows endogenously at the same rate as the aggregate capital stock.4 

Let  us  then  start  by  deriving  the  dynamics  of  the  productivity  differential.  At  a  given 
 of the population of firms, which may vary 

 there is a fraction 

(short-run) period 

from  one  period  to  the  next  one,  adopting  the  profit-sharing  labor-extraction  strategy.  The 
complementary fraction 
 is made up of firms that pay only the conventional base wage. Let 

 be the average earnings of workers at period 

, where 

 

and 

  are  the  earnings  of  a  worker  in  a  profit-sharing  firm  and  a  worker  in  a  non-sharing 

firm  in  period 
average  earnings  can  be  written  as 

,  respectively.  Therefore,  the  differential  between  the  higher  earnings  and  the 
.  In 

  for  all 

accordance  with  the  empirical  evidence  reported  earlier,  we  assume  that  the  extent  to  which 
productivity  in  profit-sharing  firms  is  greater  than  productivity  in  non-sharing  firms  varies 
positively  with  the  relative  earnings  differential  given  by 
.  Formally,  we  consider  the 

following labor-extraction differential function: 

(15) 

 

where 

that 

, 

 and 

 for all  earnings  differential 

. Moreover, we assume 

.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  the  empirical  evidence  that  the  labor 

productivity  gains  arising from profit sharing are not  unlimited, the  labor-extraction  differential 
in  (15)  not  only  rises  at  a  decreasing  rate,  but  also  tends  to  become  insignificant  for  very  large 
values of the relative earnings differential.5 We can use (2) to re-write (15) as follows: 

(15-a)   

. 

As  re-written  in  (15-a),  the  labor-extraction  differential  function  has  an  intuitive 
  is  the 

  is  the  output  per  worker  of  a  profit-sharing  firm  and 

interpretation.  Given  that 

respective unit cost of labor, it follows that 

 is the profit per worker of a profit-sharing firm 

and 

 is the amount of profit per worker of a profit-sharing firm which is shared with its 

workers.  Therefore,  given 

  and 

,  the  next-period  labor-extraction  differential  varies 

positively  with  the  profit-sharing  coefficient  and  negatively  with  the  conventional  base  wage. 
,  the  next-period  labor-extraction  differential  increases  with 
Meanwhile,  given 

  and 

, 

                                                           
4  Consequently,  the  constancy  of  the  productivity  differential  and  the  distribution  of  labor-extraction 
compensation  strategies  in  the  long-run  equilibrium  guarantee  the  constancy  of  both  the  average  labor 
productivity and the average employment rate. In fact, using (1) and (8)-(9), the average employment rate 

in  the  short-run  equilibrium  is 

,  where  the  expression  in  square 

brackets  represents  the  weighted  average  of  the  inverse  of  the  individual  productivities 

  and 

. 

5 In the meta-analyses in Weitzman and Kruse (1990) and Doucouliagos (1995), the size of the estimated 
effect of profit sharing on labor productivity is usually on the order of 3 to 7 percent.

indicator of the prospects of not receiving any shared profits in the next period. Since an increase 
in 
 acts as an incentive on workers in profit-sharing firms in the next period to yield a higher 

productivity differential, it follows that

profit-sharing firm. 

In  fact,  note  from  (15-a)  that

 and for any 

 (recall that the latter  condition  was assumed earlier to  ensure 

strictly positive gross profits for profit-sharing firms in (2)). The greater the proportion of sharing 
firms  in  a  given  period,  the  smaller  the  labor-extraction  differential  between  sharing  and  non-
sharing  firms  in  the  next  period.  One  firm’s  decision  to  play  the  profit-sharing  labor-extraction

strategy  in  a  given  period,  by  reducing 

  for  a  given 

valuable to  workers to  be employed by  a sharing firm  in  the next  period, has a negative payoff 
externality on all other sharing firms. Thus, there is strategic substitutability in the firms’ choice 
of  labor-extraction  compensation mechanism. Meanwhile, if  all firms  choose to  play  the  profit-
sharing

labor-extraction  strategy

 vanishes. In this case with all firms playing the profit-sharing strategy, 

given  that  labor  productivity  becomes  uniform  across  all  firms,  and  should  be  higher  than  the 
average  labor  productivity  when  all  firms  pay  only  the  conventional  base  wage  (recall  that  the 
productivity  in  non-sharing  firms  was  normalized  to  one),  we  further  assume  that 
. 

Conversely,  if  all  firms  choose  to  play  the  non-sharing  strategy 

,  the  potential  relative 

earnings differential  given by 

 takes its maximum value. In this case, a non-

sharing firm  which switches compensation to the  profit-sharing mode is able to reap the largest 
possible  additional  labor-extraction  gain,  since 
  for  all 

 and for any 

. In order to better convey the substance of all these properties 

of the labor-extraction differential function (15-a), they are displayed in Figure 1.

The following intuitive rationales can be proposed for the additional labor-extraction gain 
in  (15).  First,  the  average  earnings  can  be  seen  by  a  worker  as  a  conventional  estimate  of  her 
outside  option  or  fallback  position.  Consequently,  workers  who  receive  a  share  of  profits  in

productivity  gain  they  would  offer  if  remunerated  with  only  a  conventional  base  wage)  which 
increases  with  the  excess  of  the  higher  earnings  over  their  outside  option  or  fallback  position. 
Second,  the  average  earnings  can  be  perceived  by  a  worker  as  a  norm-based  reference  point 
against  which  a  compensation  package  featuring  a  conventional  base  wage  and  shared  profits 
should  be  compared  when  she  is  deciding  how  much  above-normal  productivity  to  provide  in 
return.  Therefore,  above-average  earnings  could  be  seen  by  workers  as  warranting  the  offer  of 
above-normal  levels  of  productivity.  In  fact,  Blasi,  Kruse  and  Freeman  (2010)  propose  an 
interesting  rationale  for  profit-sharing  compensation  based  on  reciprocity  and  gift  exchange  (as 
these notions are articulated in Akerlof (1982)): a “gift” of higher worker compensation through 
profit sharing raises worker morale, and workers reciprocate with a “gift” of greater productivity. 
More generally, a “gift” of profit-sharing compensation on top of a conventional base wage can 
be seen as helping to create and reinforce a sense of shared interests and the value of a reciprocal 
relationship. Alternatively, the norm-based reference point offered by the average earnings can be 
interpreted  as  reflecting  workers’  earnings  expectation  under  uncertainty.  Thus,  a  worker 
compensation package that features a conventional base wage and shared profits is  greeted as a 
pleasant surprise which warrants the offer of above-normal levels of productivity. 

While  the  frequency  distribution  of  labor-extraction  compensation  strategies  is  given  in 
the short run, an individual firm revises periodically its choice of compensation strategy in a way 
described by the following replicator dynamic:6 

(16) 

 

where 

, 

  is  the  average  net  profit  rate,  which  is  given  by  (12),  and  the  latter 

equality  is  obtained  using  (10)  and  (11),  so  that 

  and 

  are  given  by  (5)  and  (6), 

respectively.  According  to  the  replicator  dynamic  in  (16),  the  frequency  of  the  profit-sharing 
labor-extraction  strategy  in  the  population  of  firms  increases  (decreases)  exactly  when  it  has 
above-average (below-average) payoff. 

Using (5) and (6), the replicator dynamic in (16) becomes: 

(16-a)   

. 

Thus, the state transition of the economy is determined by the system of difference equations (15-
a)  and  (16-a),  whose  state  space  is 
,  as  represented  by  the 

shaded area in each panel in Figure 2. 

 
We  will  show  that  the  dynamic  system  given  by  (15-a)  and  (16-a)  has  two  long-run 
equilibria  featuring  survival  of  only  one  labor-extraction  compensation  strategy.  These  pure-
strategy equilibria are denoted by 
 in the three panels in Figure 2. Moreover, we will 

 and 

show the possible existence of a third long-run equilibrium (denoted by 

 in panel (b) in Figure 

2), now featuring the survival of both labor-extraction compensation strategies. 

                                                           
6  The  replicator  dynamic  can  be  derived  from  a  model  of  (social  or  individual)  learning  as  in  Weibull 
(1995, sec. 4.4).

We  demonstrate  in  Appendix  1  that

  in  Figure  2,  is  given  by  the  state

  in 

Figure  2,  is  represented  by  the  state

extraction compensation strategy as the only survivor. 

 

Finally, if 

 for any 

, the difference equation in (16-

a) is satisfied if the individual profit shares in (5) and (6) (and hence the profit rates in (10) and 
(11))  are  equalized.  Given  that  the  labor-extraction  differential  (which  is  equal  to  the  labor-
extraction  in  profit-sharing  firms)  is  the  only  adjusting  variable  among  the  determinants  of  the 
individual profit shares in (5) and (6), the latter become equalized when the long-run equilibrium 
value of the labor-extraction differential is: 

(18)

where  we  assume  that

  for  all

difference equation in (15-a) is satisfied if the following condition holds:

As demonstrated in Appendix 2, there is a unique 
following necessary and sufficient condition is satisfied: 

 which satisfies (19) if the

Therefore, if the condition in (20) is satisfied, there exists a third long-run equilibrium given by 

the state 

 (and denoted by

both labor-extraction compensation strategies in the long run. 

The  well-defined  ordering  in  (20),  which  implies  and  is  implied  by  the  existence  and 
, can be interpreted intuitively with recourse to 

uniqueness of the mixed-strategy equilibrium,

proportion  of  profit-sharing  firms  at  period

Figure 3. Ordering of labor-extraction differentials when there is a mixed-strategy long-

run equilibrium 

Let us now explore the dynamics of the system towards the long run as governed by the 
 isocline is the locus of all the states 

motion equations (15-a) and (16-a). The 

of  the  set  given  by 

.  Therefore,  this  isocline  connects 

the equilibrium solutions 

 and 

, as depicted in  Figure 2.  In order to  know more about  the 

 isocline, we can use (15-a) to compute the following derivative: 

(21) 

 

. 

The  sign  of  (21)  in  the  neighborhood  of  both  pure-strategy  long-run  equilibria  (

  and 
) can be determined by taking the limit of (21) as the state of the system approaches each 

of these equilibria. These limits are given by: 

(22) 

 and 

, 

with the sign of the second limit in (22) coming from (A-2.2) in Appendix 2. The reason why in 
the  vicinity  of  the  extinction  of  one  of  the  existing  labor-extraction  strategies,  the  higher  is  the 
labor-extraction  differential,  the  lower  is  the  proportion  of  profit-sharing  firms,  is  that  a  higher 
relative  earnings  differential  is  then  necessary  to  generate  a  higher  labor-extraction  differential 
(recall  that  because  there  is  strategic  substitutability  in  the  firms’  choice  of  labor-extraction 
compensation mode, the labor-extraction differential in (15) rises at a falling rate). 

 

Meanwhile, the 

 isocline is the locus of all the states of the set given by 

set is represented by a semi-inverted H-shaped isocline. 

From  the  local  stability  analysis  carried  out  in  Appendices  3-5,  the  following  results 
emerge. In the configuration depicted in panel (a) in Figure 2, the additional labor-extraction gain

In this case, 
, with no firm playing the profit-
there are only two pure-strategy long-run equilibria, 

sharing  labor-extraction  strategy,  and 

,  with  all  firms  rather  playing  the  profit-

sharing labor-extraction  strategy. As shown in Appendices 3 and 4, 

 is a repulsor, 

while 

 is an attractor. 

Meanwhile,  in  the  situation  depicted  in  panel  (c)  in  Figure  2,  the  additional  labor-
extraction  gain  for  profit-sharing  firms  ensured  by  a  given  relative  earnings  differential  is 
, 
relatively  high.  Consequently,  there  are  only  two  pure-strategy  long-run  equilibria, 

with all firms playing the non-sharing labor-extraction compensation strategy, and 

, 

with all firms rather playing the sharing labor-extraction strategy. As shown in Appendices 3 and 
4, while 

 is an attractor, 

 is a repulsor. 

Finally,  in  the  configuration  depicted  in  panel  (b)  in  Figure  2,  the  additional  labor-
extraction gain accruing to profit-sharing firms is relatively moderate. In this case, there are two 
,  and  also  one  mixed-strategy 
pure-strategy  long-run  equilibria, 

  and 

long-run  equilibrium, 

,  which 

features  heterogeneity 

in 

labor-extraction 

compensation  strategies  in  the  population  of  firms.  As  shown  in  Appendices  2-5,  while 
 is  an attractor if condition  (A-5.4) in 

 are repulsors, 

 and 

Appendix 5 is satisfied.7 

Nonetheless,  since  the  state  space  of  the  system  is  positively  invariant  (as  shown  in 
Appendix 6), in this configuration heterogeneity in labor-extraction compensation strategies does 
persist  in  the  long  run  even  if  the  mixed-strategy  long-run  equilibrium  is  not  an  attractor.  This 
positive  invariance  implies  that,  if  the  long-run  equilibrium  with  coexistence  of  both  labor-
extraction compensation strategies is not an attractor, the system keeps undergoing endogenous, 
self-sustaining  and  persistent  fluctuations  in  the  frequency  distribution  of  labor-extraction 
compensation  strategies  and  the  average  productivity,  with  the  average  levels  of  the  income 
shares  and  economic  growth  persistently  fluctuating  as  well.  In  fact,  Mitchell  et  al.  (1990)  and 
D’Art  and  Turner  (2006)  find  that  the  adoption  of  profit  sharing  schemes  has  tended  to  be 
cyclical  in  nature  in  many  advanced  countries  since  the  origin  of  these  schemes  in  the  19th 
century. 

It  is  worth  computing  the  long-run  equilibrium  values  of  the  functional  distribution  of 
income  and  economic  growth  in  each  one  of  these  three  configurations  as  regards  the  relative 
magnitude  of  the  additional  labor-extraction  gain  which  accrues  to  profit-sharing  firms,  as 
depicted in Figure 2. We can use (7) to establish:

7  As  implied  by  the  analysis  in  Appendix  5,  the  output  to  capital  ratio, 
,  is  likely  to  be  a  bifurcation 
parameter, as the long-run equilibrium with coexisting labor-extraction strategies is likely to lose (local) 
stability as the output to capital ratio crosses a given threshold from below. We leave this issue for future 
research.

may  not  occur  in  panel  (b),  as  shown  in  Appendix  5),  the  coupled  evolutionary  dynamics  of 
profit-sharing  adoption  and  labor-extraction  gain  takes  the  economy  to  a  position  in  which  the 
average net profit share, the net profit rate and the rate of economic growth are all at their highest 
possible long-run equilibrium levels. 

 
Finally,  note  that  despite  the  possibility  of  a  stable  long-run  equilibrium  outcome  with 
strategic  dualism,  the  evolutionary  dynamic  in  (16)  ensures  that  the  (net)  rates  of  profit  of  the 
coexisting labor-extraction strategies become equalized. However, in our one-sector model, profit 
rate  equalization  is  brought  about  not  by  classical  competition  with  capital  mobility  across 
sectors,  but  by  evolutionary  competition  with  firms’  (and  their  capital)  mobility  across  labor-
extraction compensation strategies. 

4. Conclusions 

This  paper  is  motivated  by  several  pieces  of  suggestive  empirical  evidence.  First, 
historically,  there  has  been  a  persistent  heterogeneity  in  worker  compensation  strategies  across 
firms,  and  profit-sharing  schemes  have  experienced  a  fluctuating  popularity.  Second,  profit 
sharing  raises  labor  productivity  in  the  firm,  and  surveys  find  that  both  employers  and  workers 
usually  perceive  profit  sharing  as  helping  to  improve  firm  performance  in  several  dimensions. 
Third,  surveys  find  that  non-deferred  and  in  cash  profit  sharing  is  ranked  first  by  workers  as 
motivation  device.  Fourth,  firms  switch  mechanisms  of  worker  compensation  (which  include 
profit sharing) frequently, with the gross changes in mechanisms being more numerous than the 
net  changes.  Fifth,  profit  sharing  has  a  meaningful  effect  on  worker  total  compensation,  which 
suggests that profit sharing tends to come on top of, rather than in place of, a base wage. 

Against  this  empirical  backdrop,  this  paper  formally  models  firms  as  periodically 
choosing to compensate workers with either a conventional base wage or a share of profits on top 
of  this  conventional  base  wage.  As  a  result,  the  frequency  distributions  of  labor-extraction 
compensation strategies and labor productivity in the population of firms are evolutionarily time-
varying.  Moreover,  we  explore  implications  of  this  coupled  evolutionary  dynamics  for  income 
distribution and economic growth. 

When the additional productivity gain for profit-sharing firms is relatively low, there are 
two long-run equilibria, one featuring all firms sharing profits and the other with no firm sharing 
profits. While the former is a repulsor, the latter is an attractor. When the additional productivity 
gain  for  profit-sharing  is  relatively  high,  the  economy  has  the  same  two  long-run  equilibria. 
However, the long-run equilibrium with  all firms  sharing profits is  an  attractor, while the long-
run equilibrium with no firm sharing profits is a repulsor. When the additional productivity gain 
for profit-sharing firms is relatively moderate, there is another long-run equilibrium, now one that 
features  heterogeneity  in  worker  compensation  modes  across  firms.  In  this  case,  the  long-run 
equilibria  with  survival  of  only  one  strategy  are  repulsors,  while  the  long-run  equilibrium  with 
coexistence  of  both  strategies  can  be  an  attractor.  However,  even  if  the  long-run  equilibrium 
configuration with coexistence of both labor-extraction strategies is not an attractor, the economy

labor-extraction compensation strategies and average labor productivity (which accords with the 
empirical  evidence),  with  functional  income  distribution  and  economic  growth  persistently 
fluctuating as well. 

Meanwhile,  when  there  is  convergence  to  some  of  the  three  long-run  equilibria,  the 
average  net  profit  rate  (which  excludes  shared  profits)  and  the  rate  of  economic  growth  are  at 
their  highest  possible  long-run  equilibrium  values.  Moreover,  there  is  profit  rate  equalization 
even in the long-run equilibrium with coexisting labor-extraction strategies. However, this profit 
rate equalization is brought about by evolutionary competition with firms’ mobility across labor-
extraction compensation strategies and not by  classical competition with capital mobility across 
sectors.

Appendix 1 - Existence and uniqueness of a long-run equilibrium with all firms playing the 
non-sharing labor-extraction strategy 

Let

positive fixed point, i.e, there is a unique real value 

 such that 

. 

We can accomplish this by using Theorem 3 in Kennan (2001, pp. 895), which makes it possible 
to  ascertain  that 
  is 

,  if  the  following  conditions  are  satisfied:  (i) 

  has  a  unique 

increasing;  (ii) 

  is  strictly  concave;  (iii) 

;  (iv) 

  for  some 

;  and  (v) 

 for some 

.  

Conditions  (i)  and  (ii)  are  satisfied.  Since 

  and 

  in  the  entire  domain  of 

,  it 

follows that for all 

 we have: 

(A-1.2) 

 and 

. 

Therefore, the function 

 is strictly increasing and strictly concave. 

Condition (iii) is also satisfied. Since 

, it follows that

Condition (iv) is also satisfied. Given that

increasing  and

Condition  (v)  is  also  satisfied.  Recall  that  we  have  assumed  that

since 

  for

can  deduce  that 

,  where  in  the  last  equality  we  have 

used L'Hôpital's rule. Thus, we can assert that for every

 such that for 

all 

  we  have 

.  This  last  inequality  can  be  re-written  as 

,  since 

such  that  for  all

simplified Samuelson conditions for the quadratic polynomial in (A-5.2):
