Abstract

A strong assumption of the standard tobit model is that its errors follow a normal
distribution. However, not all applications are well modeled by this distribution.
Some efforts have relaxed the normality assumption by considering more ﬂexible
distributions such as t and log-alpha-power. Nevertheless, presence of asymmetry
cannot be described by these ﬂexible distributions. To overcome this problem, we
propose a tobit model with errors following a Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. We
discuss some of its properties including maximum likelihood estimators, residuals
and global and local inﬂuence diagnostic tools. As part of a further extension
of this paper, we leave the following issues. The implementation of Monte Carlo
simulations to evaluate the performance of both the maximum likelihood estimators
and residuals, and the application to real data.

Resumo

Um forte pressuposto dos modelos tobit é que os erros seguem uma distri-
buição normal, mas nem todas as aplicações são modeladas da melhor forma
com essa distribuição. Esforços no sentido de relaxar a hipótese de normalidade
consideram distribuições mais ﬂexíveis como a t e a log-alpha-power, contudo
essas não modelam assimetria. De modo a resolver o problema, propomos um
modelo tobit basedo na distribuição Birnbaum-Saunders e discutimos algumas de
suas propriedades, incluindo estimadores de máxima verossimilhança, resíduos
e ferramentas de diagnóstico de inﬂuência global e local. Como parte de uma ex-
tensão natural desse artigo, deixamos os seguintes problemas. A implementação
de simulações de Monte Carlo para avaliar o desempenho dos estimadores de
máxima verossimilhança e dos resíduos, e a aplicação a dados reais.

1 Introduction

The tobit model was proposed by Tobin (1958) for limited dependent (responses)
variables and named tobit by Goldberger (1964), because of its similarity with the pro-
bit model. According to Amemiya (1984), Tobin (1958) was motivated to develop his
model by a case-study where he needed to study the relationship between house-
hold expenditure on a durable good and household incomes. The common regression
approach with ordinary least squares could not be used because there were many
observations where the expenditure was zero, which obviously destroyed the assump-
tion of linearity. To solve the problem, Tobin (1958) proposed a model that could ﬁt
the data appropriately formulating a regression model whose response was limited (or
censored) to a preﬁxed limiting value.

Tobit models have been used extensively to describe censored data in economet-
rics. The censoring occurs when the response of the regression model is not directly
observable but its independent variables. Although tobit models were born in eco-
nomics, they have been applied in biology and engineering as well. The biology re-
search relies most in analyzing the survival time of a patient (Leiva et al., 2007); the
engineers use it to model time to failure of various types of materials or machines
(Villegas et al., 2011); whereas the sociologists employ it to describe the duration of
marriage, residing in a particular region or unemployment, as well the time between
births, but the tobit models have also been used to describe inheritance, ratio of un-
employed hours to employed hours and expected age of retirement (Amemiya, 1984).
Tobit models could also be used in environmental sciences, where censored data also
are present (Thorarinsdottir and Gneiting, 2010; Helsel, 2011).

As mentioned, tobit models have a strong normality assumption. Proposals of tobit
models that relax the assumption of normality are of great importance in empirical
economics, because most of the data available in the real-world cannot be modeled
optimally with a normal distribution. Barros et al. (2010) noticed that the asymmetry
of the data and its kurtosis can be, and usually are, different from the expected for a
normal distribution, so that more ﬂexible models are needed.

The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution has been widely studied. It is positively
skewed, has a failure rate with upside-down bathtub shape, and a close relation with
the normal model; see the seminal paper by Birnbaum and Saunders (1969) and the
books by Johnson et al. (1995, pp. 651-663) and Leiva (2016). The BS distribution was
derived in terms of shape and scale parameters, but the latter is also its median. Thus,
the BS distribution can be seen as an analogue to the normal model, but in an asym-
metrical setting, where the median can be a better measure of central tendency than
the mean. The BS distribution has been applied to biological, economic, engineering
and environmental data, which have been conducted by international, transdisciplinary
groups of researchers. Some of its recent applications are attributed to Qu and Xie
(2011), Ferreira et al. (2012), Li et al. (2012), Saulo et al. (2013), Leiva et al. (2014,
2015a,b), Garcia-Papani et al. (2016) and Marchant et al. (2016a,b).

The main objective of this paper is propose a tobit-BS model by relaxing the as-
sumption of normality and supposing that its errors follow a BS distribution, which ac-
cording to the best of our knowledge, it is a topic that has not been studied before. The
secondary objectives of this paper are: (i) to develop inference for the tobit-BS model

2

based on the maximum likelihood (ML) method; (ii) to derive residuals and global and
local inﬂuence tools for model checking and diagnostics. As part of a future extension,
we leave the implementation of Monte Carlo simulations and an application to real
data.

The paper presents, along with this introduction, ﬁve sections. Section 2 provides
a background of classic tobit models and of the BS and log-BS distributions. Section
3 formulates the tobit-BS model along with inference and estimation based on the
ML method. Section 4 derives diagnostics for the proposed model including residuals
analysis and local inﬂuence tools. Finally, Section 5 discusses some conclusions and
future works.

2 Background

2.1 The tobit model

Let Y = (Y1, . . . , Ym, Ym+1, . . . , Yn)⊤ be a sample of size n, that is, independent
(IND) random variables but not independent identically distributed (IID) necessarily.
Assume that this sample includes m censored data to the left and n − m observed
(complete or uncensored) data. Thus, such censoring scheme can be visualized un-
der a regression setting with a censored response Y ∗, which is a (unobserved) latent
variable. Hence, the m censored data (unobserved)correspond to the values of Y ∗
less than or equal to a threshold point y0 (censoring to the left), so that all of these
data take the value y0. The other n − m data (observed) are related to values of Y ∗
greater than y0, which can be described by a linear regression structure of the type
x⊤
i β. All this modeling environment may be formulated by the normal tobit model with
censored response to the left as

Yi =(yo,

x⊤

i β + εi,

if Y ∗
if Y ∗

i ≤ y0,
i > y0,

i = 1, . . . , m;
i = m + 1, . . . , n;

(1)

IID∼ N(0, σ2) is the model error term, β is a vector of regression coefﬁcients
where εi
corresponding to unknown parameters to be estimated, and xi is a vector containing
the values of explanatory variables (covariates). Observe that y0 given in (1) is a
preﬁxed limiting value that does the response of the regression model deﬁned in (1) to
be limited (or censored), as mentioned by Tobin (1958).

is deﬁned, However, instead of using x⊤β, from (2) and (3), the expected response is
formulated as

E[Y |x] = P(Y = 1) = P(Y ∗ > y0) = P(x⊤β + ε > y0) = 1 − Φ(y0 − x⊤β),

(4)

where Φ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribu-
tion. Note that other CDFs might be assumed for Φ in (4), so expanding the covering
of the probit model.

Probit and tobit models are the same for the latent variable (Y ∗), but models for the
observed response (Y ) are different. In the tobit model, we know the value of Y ∗ when
Y ∗ > y0, whereas in the probit model we just know that Y ∗ > y0, but we do not know
its value. Thus, there is more information in the tobit model than in the probit model.
Also, the estimates of β in the tobit model are more efﬁcient than in the probit model.
Moreover, for the censored cases of the probit model, it is not possible to estimate the
variance of Y ∗. However, in the tobit model, this variance can be estimated from the
data. For more details, see Scott (1997, p. 199).

2.2 The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution

If a random variable T follows a BS distribution with shape parameter α and scale
parameter σ, we use the notation T ∼ BS(α, σ). This distribution can be deﬁned by its
CDF given by

t > 0, α > 0, σ > 0.

(5)

Then, the probability density function (PDF) of T obtained from (5) is expressed as

FT (t; α, σ) = Φ(cid:18) 1

fT (t; α, σ) =

t > 0, α > 0, σ > 0,

where φ is the standard normal PDF. Thus, the PDF in (6) can be rewritten as

fT (t; α, σ) =

t > 0, α > 0, σ > 0.

(6)

(7)

Note that the results provided in (5) and (6) may be obtained from the transformation
theorem of random variables by using

T = σ(cid:18)αZ/2 +q(αZ/2)2 + 1(cid:19)2

,

(8)

where Z ∼ N(0, 1). Also from (8), it may be veriﬁed that a continuous random vari-
able T has a BS distribution with parameters α > 0 and σ > 0, if and only if Z =

(1/α)(cid:0)pT /σ−pσ/T(cid:1) ∼ N(0, 1). Some properties of the BS distribution are presented

as follows. If T ∼ BS(α, σ), then: (i) E(T ) = σ(1 + α2/2) and Var(T ) = (ασ)2(1 + 5α2/4);
(ii) for b > 0, bT ∼ BS(α, bσ), which means that the BS distribution is closed under

4

scalar multiplication (proportionality); (iii) 1/T ∼ BS(α, 1/σ), implying that the BS distri-
bution is closed under reciprocation; (iv) the median of the distribution of T is σ, which
can be directly obtained when q = 0.5 from its quantile function given by

t(q; α, σ) = F −1

0 < q < 1,

T (q; α, σ) = σαz(q)

+s(cid:18)αz(q)

where z(q) is the standard normal quantile function; and (v) the BS distribution is
positively skewed as α increases and approximately symmetrical around σ as α goes
to zero; see Figure 1(left). Properties of proportionality and reciprocation given above
in (ii) and (iii) are easily veriﬁed by using once again the mentioned transformation
theorem.

The survival function (SF) and hazard rate (HR) of T ∼ BS(α, σ) are given respec-

tively by

2.3 The log-Birnbaum-Saunders distribution

When modeling data with the BS distribution, its logarithmic version (log-BS) is
needed. A random variable Y has a log-BS distribution with shape (α > 0) and
location (µ ∈ R) parameter, which is denoted by log-BS(α, µ), if and only if Z =
(2/α)sinh((Y − µ)/2) ∼ N(0, 1). Then, the CDF of Y is given by

Consequently, from (9), the PDF of Y is obtained as

log(fY (y; α, µ)) = − log(2)−

y ∈ R.
(11)
Some properties of the log-BS distribution are presented as follows. If Y ∼ log-BS(α, µ),
then: (i) T = exp(Y ) ∼ BS(α, σ), which means that the log-BS PDF given in (10) can
be obtained from the standard normal PDF as in (9) or from the BS PDF deﬁned in
(7); (ii) E (Y ) = µ; (iii) there is no closed form for the variance of Y , but based upon

α

5

an asymptotic approximation for the moment generating function of the log-BS distri-
bution, it follows that, if α → 0, then Var(T ) = α2 − α4/4, whereas that, if α → ∞, then
Var(T ) = 4(log2(√2α) + 2−2 log(√2α)); (iv) if X = ±Y + d, then X ∼ log-BS(α,±µ + d);
and (v) the log-BS distribution is symmetric around µ, unimodal for α ≤ 2 and bimodal
for α > 2; see Figure 1(right).

3 The tobit-BS model

3.1 Formulation

Consider the BS regression model

Ti = exp(x⊤

i β)δi,

i = 1, . . . , n,

(12)

originally proposed by (Rieck and Nedelman, 1991), where Ti is the response, xi and
β are analogously deﬁned as in (2), and δi ∼ BS(α, 1) is the model error. By applying
logarithm in (12), we obtain

Yi = x⊤

i β + εi,

i = 1, . . . , n,

(13)

where Yi = log(Ti) is the log-response i, xi and β are similar to (1), and εi = log(δi) ∼
log-BS(α, 0) is the error term of the model. Then, based on (1) and (13), we propose a
tobit-BS model as

Yi =(y0,

i > y0,

where Y ∗

3.2 Estimation

We estimate the parameters of the tobit-BS model deﬁned in (14) with the ML
method, in which case the log-likelihood function for θ = (α, β⊤)⊤ obtained from (11)
takes the form

l(θ) = −(n−m) log(2)−(n−m)

To obtain the ML estimators, it is necessary to maximize the log-likelihood given in

However, the system of equations deﬁned by these two equations does not have an
analytic solution. Leiva et al. (2007) suggested the use of the Broyden-Fletcher-
Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm, using as a starting values for the numerical procedure

composed by the rows xi. Recall that the log-BS distribution can be bimodal if α > 2.
It implicates that the log-likelihood function has more than one maximum value. How-
ever, Rieck and Nedelman (1991) and Leiva (2016) argued that α > 2 is unusual in
practice, which means that the maximum point is often unique.

3.3 Inference

Assuming that the regularity conditions deﬁned in Cox and Hinkley (1974) are sat-

isﬁed, the ML estimatorsbα and bβ are consistent and follow a multivariate normal joint

asymptotic distribution. This distribution has an asymptotic mean vector with elements
α and β and have an asymptotic covariance matrix equal to J (θ)−1, which can be
approximated by the expected Fisher information matrix. Therefore, as n → ∞, we
have that
(18)
where J (θ) = limn→∞(1/n)I(θ), with I(θ) being the expected Fisher information ma-
trix. In addition, d→ means convergence in distribution to and 0p+1 is a p × 1 vector of
zeros. Note thatbI(θ)−1 is a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance-covariance
matrix of bθ, J (θ)−1 say. In practice, one may approximate the expected Fisher infor-

of the diagonal of the inverse of the observed information matrix can be used to ap-
proximate the corresponding standard errors (SEs). The observed Fisher information
matrix is obtained from the Hessian matrix, which contains the second partial deriva-
tives of (15) and given by

4 Diagnostic analysis

4.1 Residual analysis

The objective of the residual analysis is to assess if the errors hold the distribu-
tional, heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation assumptions, as well the presence of
atypical data.
In classic regression models, Pearson and studentized residuals are
often used. However, in tobit models, in general, even under normality, these type of
residuals are inadequate Barros et al. (2010). For the tobit-BS model, we propose a
deviance component (DC) and martingale-type (MT) residuals. These residuals are
often used in generalized linear models and survival analysis, respectively.
In general, the DC residual is deﬁned as (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989)

rDC

i = sign(2δi)q2(ℓi(bθs) − ℓi(bθ)),

i = 1, . . . , n,

of θ for the saturated model (a model with n parameters), θ is the ML estimate of the

where ℓi(θ) represents the log-likelihood function for the case i, bθs is the ML estimate
model of interest, and bµi is the expected value of Yi, E(Yi) say. Davison and Gigli

(1989) speciﬁed the DC residual for censored data as

i = 1, . . . , n

(23)

rDC

i = sign(2δi)q−2 log(bSY (yi; θ)),

rDC

i = 1, . . . , m;

The MT residual in deﬁned as

sign(x) = {−1, 0, 1}, for x < 0, x = 0 and x > 0, respectively. For the tobit-BS model
and from (23), the DC residual using is described as

where bSY is the corresponding SF of the model and the sign function is deﬁned as
i =
sign(2bδi)q−2 log (Φ(− 2

sign(2bδi)q2 log (cosh(bδi)) + 2
i )p−2(rM
i = ηi + log (bSY (yi)),

with bSY being the ML estimate for the SF of Y (Klein and Moeschberger, 1997; Ortega

et al., 2003). For the tobit-BS model and from (26), the martingale residual takes the
form

α2 (sinh(bδi))2,

i + ηi log(ηi − rM

where ηi = 0 indicates that the case i is censored, whereas ηi = 1 indicates that the

sent the deviance component of the tobit model, instead it merely is a transformation of
the martingale residual that produces symmetrically distributed residuals around zero.

(2007) and Barros et al. (2010).

4.2 Global inﬂuence

A global inﬂuence method commonly used in statistical modeling is the Cook dis-
tance, which allows us to assess the effect of each case on the estimated parameters.
The methodology proposed by Cook (1977) and Cook and Weisberg (1982) suggests
the deletion of each observation and the evaluation of the log-likelihood function with-
out the case i. The generalized Cook distance (GCD) for a standard tobit model was
given by Barros et al. (2010) and it takes the form

GCDi(θ) =

(bθ −bθ(i)) ¨ℓ−1(bθ −bθ(i)),

i = 1, . . . , n,

(28)

where p is the number of model coefﬁcients and bθi is the ML estimate of θ without the
case i. In order to facilitate the calculations, a ﬁrst order approximation bθ −bθi ≈ ¨ℓ−1

is used in (28) and it becomes

9

in (29), we must calculate the GCD eliminating each case. However, with this approx-
imation, we need to calculate the GCD just once. Usually, the diagnostics analysis
relies on the vector β of coefﬁcients. Then, in that case, (28) becomes

GCDi(β) =

(bβ − bβ(i)) ¨ℓ−1(bβ − bβ(i)),

i = 1, . . . , n.

(30)

To determine whether the case i is potentially inﬂuential on β, we use the same bench-
mark used by Zhu and Zhang (2004) and Barros et al. (2010), which is 2/n. If the value
of the GCD for the case i is greater than 2/n, the case i is potentially inﬂuential on the
estimated vector of parameters.

4.3 Local Inﬂuence

One way to assess the effect produced by one case on the ML estimates is the
deletion of each of them from the data set and then evaluate if it exercises inﬂuence
on the estimates or not. This approach is known as global inﬂuence. However, the
local inﬂuence method relies on a geometric differentiation, taking the curvature of
the plane of the log-likelihood function. This method does not require any deletion.
Often the differential comparison is made before and after a perturbation. There are
many ways to conduct a local inﬂuence analysis. We use case-weight, response and
covariate perturbation schemes.
Recalling that θ = (α, β⊤)

is the vector of parameter, let ℓ(θ|ω) be the log-
likelihood function of the model deﬁned in (14) perturbed by ω, where ω is a subset of
Ω ∈ Rn. One way to evaluate the inﬂuence of a perturbation over the estimates of θ is
to use the likelihood displacement (LD), which is given by

⊤

(31)

LD(ω) = 2(ℓ(bθ) − ℓ(bθω)),

where bθω is the ML estimate of θ based on ℓ(θ|ω). To detect what case exercises

inﬂuence on LD(ω) deﬁned in (31), we use the normal curvature in the direction of
the vector l, with ||l|| = 1. The normal curvature given by Barros et al. (2010) can be
expressed as
(32)
where ∆ is a matrix of perturbations and ¨ℓ is the Hessian matrix given in (19). The
matrix ∆ has elements

Cl(θ) = 2|l⊤∆⊤ ¨ℓ−1∆l|,

∂2ℓ(θ|ω)/∂θj∂ωi,

j = 1, . . . , p + 1, i = 1, . . . , n,

and must be evaluated at θ = bθ and ω = ω0, where ω0 is a non-perturbation vector.

To determine what case are inﬂuential under small perturbations, Barros et al. (2010)
proposed an index plot based on the eigenvector of lmax, which can be constructed by
using the maximum eigenvalue of

B(θ) = |∆⊤ ¨ℓ−1∆|,

(33)

evaluated at θ = bθ. On the one hand, if the interest relies just on the vector of param-

eter β, (32) becomes

(34)

Cl(θ) = 2|l⊤∆⊤( ¨ℓ−1 − B1)∆l|.

10

Note that (34) removes α from the analysis. Thus, the inﬂuence detection is only made
on β, where B1 under a tobit-BS model takes the form

On the other hand, if the interest is just on α, (32) becomes

where B2 for the tobit-BS model is given by

0

B1 =(cid:18) tr(G)−1 0
0 (cid:19) .
Cl(θ) = 2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)l⊤∆⊤( ¨ℓ−1 − B2)∆l(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,
0 (X ⊤V X)−1 (cid:19) ,
B2 =(cid:18) 0

0

with tr(G) and (X ⊤V X)−1 being obtained from the Hessian matrix of the tobit-BS
model given in (19).

The maximum normal curvature vector, denoted by lmax, is an important direction

to assess the local inﬂuence on bθ, however it is not the only one. The vector li = ein

denotes the direction of the case i, where ein is the canonical basis of Rn. It assumes
zero for every case except the case i, which assumes the value one. The normal
curvature of each observation is given by Ci(θ) = 2|bii|, where bii represents the ith
element of the matrix deﬁned in (33) for each observation. A observation is potentially

inﬂuential on θ if Ci(bθ) > 2C(bθ), where C(bθ) is the mean of the Ci‘s for i = 1, . . . , n;

see Lesaffre and Verbeke (1998). Below we present three perturbation schemes and
each of their corresponding perturbation matrix ∆

Case-weight Perturbation The case-weight perturbation scheme allows us to eval-
uate the cases that, under different weights, affect the ML estimates of θ. Suppose
=1 ωiℓi, with ℓi given in (15) and
ωi ∈ [0, 1] is a perturbation vector. Considering the partial derivative with respect to
ω⊤, we obtain

that the log-likelihood function is given by ℓ(θ|ω) =Pn

The case-weight perturbation matrix given by ∆ in (38) can be decomposed in ∆α =
(a1, . . . , an) and ∆β = X ⊤ diag{b1, . . . , bn}.

Response perturbation There are different scenarios that one can consider for the
response perturbation. We consider here a response perturbation scheme with an
additive perturbation, which is deﬁned by

Yiω = Yi + ωiSY , i = m + 1, . . . , n,

where SY is a scale component that can be the standard deviation of the response. Let
us consider that the log-likelihood function of the tobit-BS model is given by ℓ(θ|ω) =

i=1 ℓi(θ|ω), with

Pn
ℓi(θ) =(Pm

i = m + 1, . . . , n;

(39)

where ζi1ω1, ζi2ω1, ζ c
i2ω1 are as deﬁned in (16) after changing Y for Yiω. The process of
obtaining the perturbation matrix in this scheme is composed by two steps, ﬁrst the
derivative of (39) with respect to ω⊤ is taken, i.e.,

∂ℓi(θ|ωi)

∂ω⊤ =(0⊤

SY

ζi1ω1(cid:17) − ζi2ω1ζi1ω1,

i = 1, . . . , m,

i = m + 1, . . . , n.

(40)

Then, the partial derivative of (40) with respect to θ is computed and evaluated at

θ = bθ, to obtain the response perturbation matrix ∆ with elements
(sech (δi))2(cid:19) .

∆α = (c1, . . . , cm), ∆β = X ⊤ diag{d1, . . . , dm},

Note that the response perturbation scheme, in a tobit model, makes sense only for
the non-censored part of the data. This occurs because the censored part of the data
is either unobservable or below the threshold y0, otherwise, the case i receives the
same value y0. Then, there is no perturbation in this part of the data.

Covariate Perturbation As in the response scheme there are several ways to insert
covariate perturbation. Here, we insert an additive perturbation that takes the form

5 Concluding remarks

It is widely known that the normal distribution does not model perfectly a consid-
erable part of real data sets.
In this paper, we have proposed an extension of the
standard tobit model, the tobit-BS model, by assuming a Birnbaum-Saunders distribu-
tion. We have discussed maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. We
have also provided global and local inﬂuence tools for the tobit-BS model. In special,
as a global inﬂuence tool we have derived the generalized Cook distance, and for local
inﬂuence procedures we have derived the normal curvatures under different pertur-
bation schemes. Research regarding the implementation of Monte Carlo simulations
and the application to real data is currently in progress and we hope to report some
ﬁndings in a future paper.
