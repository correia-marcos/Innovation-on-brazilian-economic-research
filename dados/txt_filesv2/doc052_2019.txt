Scenario Analysis Trough DSGE Model 

 

RESUMO 

O  objetivo  central  deste  artigo  foi  analisar  sob  diferentes  cenários,  a  trajetória  da  dívida  pública 
considerando que o governo segue uma regra para o teto dos gastos correntes. A modelagem está baseada 
em um modelo Dinâmico Estocástico de Equilíbrio Geral (DSGE), calibrado para a economia brasileira. 
Testaram-se as respostas das variáveis de interesse em dois cenários distintos, assumindo o cumprimento 
ou não da nova regra fiscal por parte do governo. Assim, nas simulações em que o governo não cumpriu o 
teto, considerando que os gastos superaram em 3% a meta definida pela regra, o resultado primário caiu 
de forma significativa e a dívida do governo cresceu persistentemente ao longo do tempo, mesmo diante 
dos  choques  positivos  de  produtividade  e  sobre  os  tributos.  Por  outro  lado,  para  os  cenários  onde  o 
governo cumpriu a regra do teto, a  responsabilidade fiscal foi capaz de corrigir o desequilíbrio em suas 
contas,  tanto  diante  do  choque  de  produtividade,  como  também,  frente  aos  choques  fiscais  sobre  os 
tributos.  Em  suma,  os  resultados  apontam  que  um  ajuste  fiscal,  por  meio  de  uma  regra  que  controle  os 
gastos, tem efeito relevante sobre a sustentabilidade da dívida do governo.

ABSTRACT 

 

The main goal of this work is to analyze the public debt trajectory under different fiscal scenarios, where 
government does or does not follow a rule that limits public expenses, within the structure of a Stochastic 
Dynamic General Equilibrium Model (DSGE) calibrated for Brazilian economy. The variables responses 
were tested in simulations on which government did not comply with the public expenses limit rule and 
spent  3%  beyond  the  rule’s  limit  and  in  a  scenario  where  it  spent  3%  below  the  rule’s  limit.  When  the 
fiscal authority spent below the rule, the fiscal posture was able to correct fiscal unbalance in face of taxes 
or productivity shocks. Otherwise, when government did not follow the rule, it was unable to equilibrate 
fiscal budget even under positive shocks. The results point out that a fiscal adjustment through a rule that 
controls expenditures would have a relevant effect on the sustainability of government debt.

1.INTRODUCTION 

Current  macroeconomic  debate  in  Brazil  has  been  focused  on  questions  related  to  fiscal 
unbalance.  Since  the  rapid  growth  of  public  debt  between  2014  and  2017  we  have  seen  a  consensus 
between economists that the use of fiscal instruments based on prefixed rules can be a solution.  On this 
sense,  in  2016,  the  federal  government  approved  a  bill  (PEC  55/2411)  indexing  the  growth  of  public 
expenses in one year to the inflation rate of past year. 

 
The  fall  in  Brazilian  government  revenues  started  in  2011  added  to  the  continuous  growth  on 
public  primary  spending,  that  presented  a  growth  average  of  5%  between  1997  and  2015,  are 
indispensable  to  comprehend  the  recent  deterioration  on  Brazilian  fiscal  balance.  If  in  the  beginning  of 
XXI  century  we could  observe  a  comfortable fiscal  situation, with  a primary  surplus of 2% in  2000, in 
2014 the situation were drastically different, with a primary deficit of 3%. As a direct effect, gross public 
debt GDP/ratio jumped from 51.5% in 2013 to 74.2% in 20172.   

 
As  a  way  to  correct  this  explosive  debt  path,  Temer  Administration  presented  a  constitutional 
amendment  (EC/95),  approved  in  2016,  objectifying  the  establishment  of  a  new  fiscal  rule.  This  rule, 
represented in final instance by the PEC 95/241, contains a set of particular characteristics as: 

(i)  Some  expenses  are  excluded  form  the  proposal,  as  the  case  of  constitutional  transfers  to 
federation  states  and  municipalities,  FUNDEB  complementation,  electoral  justice  expenses  and 
also state companies capital increase; (ii) expenses on public health and education are adjusted by 
previous  period  inflation  rate;  (iii)  the  expenses  limit  is  dividual  for  each  government  sector,  in 
case  of  on  sector  bypass  the  limit,  this  sector  is  prevented  to  realize  public  employee  selections 
and give a wage raise to its employees. HORTA (2016, p. 286)3 

 
Different  economists  have  evaluated  the  impacts  of  fiscal  rules  in  Brazilian  economy,  and  we 
highlight the works of Souza Junior and Santos (2017), Cavalcanti and Vereda (2014) and Saraiva et. al. 
(2017).  

Souza Junior and Santos (2017) made a series of simulations under different scenarios on which, 
one  of  the  scenarios,  include  the  public  expenses  limit  rule  (PEC  95/241).  They  could  observe  that  the 
medium-term  effect  of  the  rule  is  a  primary  surplus  generation,  and  as  consequence,  in  the  long  run  it 
would consistently affect the public debt reduction.  

Cavalcanti and Vereda (2014) using a DSGE model, observes the impacts of different fiscal rules 
on  Brazilian  case.  From  a  set  of  public  expenses  data,  including  and  splitting  expenses  as  goods  and 
services, government investments, welfare expanses and expenses on public workers’ salaries, they could 
notice  that  when  a  fiscal  rule  is  applied  on  one  of  those  types  of  expenditure,  there  is  no  significant 
positive  short-term  effect  on  the  GDP.  However,  there  is  a  positive  medium-term  effect  on  the  GDP, 
where they assume that the public investment multiplier, under the rule adopted by them,  is greater than 
one. 
 
Other  work  on  the  subject,  which  searches  for  alternative  fiscal  rules  on  Brazilian  economy,  is 
Santos (2017) where the author structured a DSGE model including government capital and an exogenous 
risk shock on government bonds. He tested three different scenarios: i) with a primary surplus rule; ii) a 
rule to limit primary expenses in proportion with GDP; iii) a rule similar to PEC 95/241. Santos (2017) 
found that (iii) has a positive effect on GDP and aggregated consumption level stabilization.

individualizado por poder, e em caso da extrapolação destes limites, o poder fica impedido da realização de concurso público, 
conceder aumento salarial e contratar pessoal. HORTA (2016, p. 286). 

 

Saraiva  et.  al.  (2017)  intents,  through  a  calibrated  DSGE  model,  to  analyze  the  effects  of  PEC 
 
95/241 on population welfare levels on different scenarios. Paper results indicates a non-significant effect 
of  the  rule  on  welfare.  Otherwise,  if  the  rule  relaxes  the  limit  in  which  concerns  public  investment, 
superior gains on welfare can be achieved. 

On  this  research,  we  aim  to  analyze  the  public  debt  path  in  two  different  fiscal  scenarios 
associating  the  public  expenses  limit  rule  to  exogenous  shocks  of  productivity  and  taxes.  The  modeled 
scenarios are going to be part of a low fiscal dominance regime4 and tested within the structure of DSGE 
model. The theoretical basis of our work is the model developed by De Resende and Rebei (2008), which 
allowed  us  to  incorporate  an  intertemporal  optimization  problem to  the  fiscal  policy  rule.  This  research 
empirical strategy consists in a parametric calibration method, the emulated model adherence test, and the 
responses  function  behavior  to  productivity  and  taxes  shocks  in  two  different  scenarios:  the  first 
associated with the enforcement of public expenses limit rule; and the second with the no enforcement.  

This  paper  contains  this  brief  introduction,  four  sections  and  a  short  conclusion.  If,  on  the  first 
section of this paper we discuss the fiscal rule in Brazil, in the second, we expose our theoretical model to 
present, in the third and fourth section the method and the results. 
 

2.THEORETICAL MODEL 

 
The  theoretical  model  structure  assumes  the  hypothesis  of  a  closed  economy  with  three  sectors 
and is based on propositions of Smets and Wouters (2003) and Galí et.al.(2007). Not only, the benchmark 
of the model general structure is the theoretical proposal of De Resende; Rebei (2008).

2.2.1  Final goods firms 
Following the structure as defined by De Resende e Rebei (2008), the model adopted assumes two 
 
kinds  of  firms:  The  first  is  a  final  goods  firm,  which  aggregates  intermediate  goods  in  the  process  of 
production and acts at a perfectly competitive market5, with one homogeneous good   . The second is a 
continuous  set  of  firms  indexed  by               which  produces  intermediate  goods  in  a  monopolistically 
competitive market. 

From  Dixit-Stiglitz  (1997)  standard  aggregation,  we  have  that  the  firms  which  produces  final 

 
goods    combine intermediate goods      according to the following production function: 

  

   
 
                   (∫     

 

 

 

   

  )

                     ( ) 

Given  the  nominal  prices  of  final  and  intermediate  goods  as      e      ,  the  profit  maximization 

problem of the final good firm can be represented as: 

 

            

        

        ∫     

                        ( ) 

 

 

Solving the function (3) we obtain the first order condition: 

As (5) represents the demand for different intermediate good, we shall substitute it on function (3). 

 
So, we get that the final good price will be determined by the following pricing rule:  

                            (

  )

       ( ) 

 

2.2.2  Intermediate Goods Firms  

In  order  to  produce  the  intermediate  good   ,  the  firm  combines  two  inputs:  labor  and  capital.  In 
this sense, if we assume a competitive market of production factors, the Cobb-Douglas function is going 
to be given as: 

                                                                                                    

 

       ( ) 
    

        is the capital stock used by the firm, while the services obtained from labor force are represented 
by      .  More,  the  productive  shock  on  (7)  will  follow  an  autoregressive  process  AR  (1),  where      
    (    )      ,  with      (   ) e                (

Following  the  rule  defined  by  De  Resende  and  Rebei  (2008),  we  introduced  a  nominal  price 
rigidity  a la Calvo (1983). With this, the firm will always when possible re-optimize the goods price at

The Government 

Further the use of a long-term fiscal policy rule based De Resende; Rebei (2008), we introduced 

 
into the model a fiscal rule which limits the primary expenditure as a intertemporal resources restriction: 

 

 

(        )      

(       )

  

 

    
  

(        )

                                                                                                                      (  ) 

(       )

    and 

  

    
  
(       )

  

As  can  be  seeing,  term  (        )      is  the  public  primary  expenses  limit  rule  equation  and 
 
takes in account the subordination of government current expenditure growth at time t from inflation rate 
(        )  is  the  financial  expenditure  with  public  debt  average  interest  rate  and 

in      .  Also, 

  are  the  revenues  corresponding  to  bond  and  money  issue  in  between  the  two 

periods. 

Excluding  the  debt  interest  expenses  restriction  and  financial  revenues,  the  primary  surplus  and 

 
seigniorage at moment t can be defined as:   

          

      

                                                     (  ) 

 

Otherwise, the public level indebt dynamic in successive periods of time will follow the structure: 

                              

   

(         )

  

                                 (  ) 

 
                                    ∑
   

       
 
   

∏ (      )

                            (  ) 

Where primary surplus is given by         and    is the economy interest rate. As we assumed that fiscal 
authority  follows  a  expenses  limit  rule  and  chases  a  primary  surplus  in  all  infinity  periods,  govern 
intertemporal utility function can be: 

                               [∑   (  

    (      )(        )    )

]           (  )    

 

   

Where       (   )  represents  the intertemporal  discount  factor and      (      )(        )     are  the 
government primary expenditure limited by the adopted rule. According with Alper et. al. (2006), the use 
of  this  type  of  utility  function  comes  from  the  assumption  that  the  government  behavior  is  rational  and 
rigid when it comes to political and economy decisions. 

However, we also assume that the government will spend as much as he can in between the rule 

 
limits. So the optimization problem will have a convex restriction as: 

 

                                                               (        )                         (  )   

With  restriction  (16)  the  government  expenditure  intertemporal  optimization  problem,  can  be 

represented by the following Lagrangean: 

        

                                (      )(        )    

   ((      )(        )    
  (        )    )                                                                                                    (  ) 

Where   is the Lagrange multiplier. Solving the problem related to     , we have: 

  

     

   (      )(        )    ((      )(        )   (        ))      

                                 

 

     

                      (  ) 

From (18), is notable that a government decision of expenses expansion aim to stimulate the economy can 
bring adverse effects on fiscal variables behavior. Deriving the same problem in relation to  , we get: 

  

  

  (      )(        )       (        )        ; 

             (  ) 

With  the  government  problem  defined  from  condition  (19)  we  can  make  some  considerations: 
 
from  utility  function  (15),  when        ,  trivial  solution  is  the  same  as  the  function  of  expenses  rule, 
being  this  the  parametric  value  that  maximizes  utility  and  the  economy  path  in  absence  of  exogenous 
shocks.  

As  we  already  know  government  budget  restriction  (11),  taxes  on  consumption  and  income, 
  e    will follow a stochastic process AR (1) gave by the ratio between the logarithms of 

respectively   
them in relation to stationary values defined by: 

                                                                                  (

RESULTS ANALYSIS 

3.1 

Structure Parameters Calibration 

In this work the chosen strategy was one involving parameters calibrations derived from the past 
decades Brazilian economy structural changes. According to Cavalcanti and Vereda (2014), depending on 
the model complexity can be harder to estimate and comprehend the model structural parameters. On this 
way,  we  adopt  as  references  to  calibrate  the  parameter  SAMBA7  model  as  developed  by  Castro  et.  al. 
(2015), and also the parameter on De Resende e Rebei (2008) and Ornellas (2011) papers. Between the 

                                                           
6 The budget restriction present value is backed up by the non-waste of revenues hypothesis.  
7 SAMBA  means  Stochastic Analytical Model with Bayesian Approach, and is the name  of a Brazilian Central Bank  model, 
used as a decision basis. 

calibrated  parameters,  disposed  on  Tables  1  and  2,  intertemporal  discount  factor     presents  a  value 
slightly lower than 18, a economy interest rate of approximately 8.5% p.a. and a inflation target of 4.5% 
p.a.

The   parameter express proportion between capital income and economy aggregated income, and 
 
had its value calibrated according to Castro et. al. (2015). Furthermore, the capital depreciation factor was 
adjusted  to  0.015  quarterly,  coming  close  to  Bonelli  and  Fonseca  (1998)  and  Fernandes  Neto  (2014) 
estimates. At the same time, capital adjustment cost parameter had its value placed as 6.59, following the 
Ornellas  (2011)  estimates.  This  value  is  slightly  different  from  the  Smets  and  Wouters  (2003)  and 
Christoffel et. al. (2008), when corresponding values are 5.9 and 5.8. 

Calvo  rigidity  parameter  was  assumed  at  0.74,  what  implies  an  adjustment  probability  of  0.26. 
This  value  converges  with  Carvalho  and  Valli  (2010)  estimates  that  were  found  at  0.738  and  also  the 
values  commonly  found  on  international  literature,  as  in  the  works  of  Smets  and  Woulters  (2003)  and 
Galí et. al. (2007).  

The  persistency  parameters  related  to  exogenous  shocks,  as  in  example  the  productive  shock 
persistency9  had  been  settled  according  to  Castro  et.  al.  (2015).  At  the  same  time,  the  taxes  shock 
persistency had been defined following the estimates of De Resende and Rebei (2008). 

                                                           
8 The intertemporal discount parameter value is smaller than 1, indicating that the agent discounts the future. 
9 The estimations corresponding values to the coefficient were in most studies defined between [0,60;0,98]. 

 Lastly,  we  highlight  the  two  most  important  parameter  in  calibration  process:  the  first  is  ,  in 
wich the fixed value was 0.93, what according to equation (26) configures a low fiscal dominance regime. 
The second is  the parameter related to  the government expenses limit  rule, and was calibrated from  the 
fiscal  authority  desire  of  accomplish  or  not  the  expenses  limit  rule.  On  this  sense,  when  government 
follows the rule        , when it doesn’t         and the optimum point is when        . 

On  Table  2  we  present  some  macroeconomic  aggregates  calibration  reasons.  Government 
GDP/Expenses ratio had been extracted from Fernandes Neto (2014), whom uses a Hodrick-Prescott filter 
on government consumption and GDP series, which allows him to infer the expenses proportion through 
smoothed  series.  Furthermore,  government  gross  indebt  level  had  been  fixed  expressing  the  real  long-
term variable tendency.

Consumption  and  income  taxes  had  been  calibrated  according  to  Ornellas  (2011)  definitions, 
whom  uses  consumption  taxes  related  to  GDB  basic  prices,  and  income  taxes  related  to  economy 
production. 

3.2  Empirical Model Adherence Test  
After  parameters  calibration,  a  cyclical  analysis  of  the  artificial  economy  properties  is  needed. 
 
Following Kanczuk (2004), Mussolini  and Teles (2012) and Divino  et.  al. (2012) analytical  method we 
used  quarterly  data  from  1999  to  2018,  and  smoothed  then  using  Holdrick-Prescott  filter,  meaning  to 
detach  the  tendency  from  the  cyclical  component  and  then  evaluate  second  moments  with  the  standard 
deviations  and  the  contemporary  correlation  components.  The  considered  variables  were:  (1)  Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP); (2) Consumption; (3) Investment; (4) Government Spending; (5) Government 
debt/GDP Ratio; (6) Monetary offer; (7) Interest Rate; and (8) Inflation Rate. 

So  we  compare  cyclical  behavior  of  the  artificial  economy  and  data  of  real  Brazilian  Economy 
 
responses to productive shock and also the different outcomes from government fiscal posture related to 
the  expenses  limit  rule.  Two  different  postures  were  analyzed:  in  the  first  speculated  scenario,  the 
government does not accomplish the rule, and spent 3% beyond the budget imposition, so            . 
In the second speculated scenario, the government accomplishes the rule and spent 3% below the budget 
imposition, and we have             . 

On  Table  3  we  present  the  moments  generated  by  the  artificial  economy  on  both  speculated 
 
scenarios. The model cyclical behavior and data adherence can be verified from the variables directions 
related  to  gross  domestic  production.  On  this  sense,  the  observation  parts  from  the  contemporary 
correlation coefficient between each variable and the gross domestic production.  

 
Initially,  we  can  attest  that  most  variables  present  a  pro-cyclical  behavior  on  both  real  and 
artificial  economy,  and  we  can  highlight  the  variables  consumption,  investment  and  monetary  stock, 

which  indicate  a  good  data  adherence.  Also,  the  fiscal  variables  present  a  pro-cyclical  tendency  at  the 
same moment that the public debt presents a counter-cyclical behavior in the real economy, this finding is 
reinforced by Vegh (2015) results, that appoints the pro-cyclical role of government spending. 

However,  in  the  simulated  scenario  1  where  government  spends  3%  more  then  allowed  by  the 
fiscal  rule,  the  debt  signal  is  inverse,  and  presents  a  pro-cyclical  behavior.  Otherwise,  in  the  simulated 
scenario 2, when government saves 3% more, the behavior is counter-cyclical.

In Table 3 we can see that production, consumption and government spent were more volatile on 
 
real economy. Otherwise, the investment volatility was close between the real economy and the scenario 
1 artificial economy.  From  this, we can conclude that artificial economy  can consistently  reproduce the 
cyclical behavior of Brazilian economy within the observed period. 

 
The  debt  volatility  pardon  also  presents  a  close  relation  between  real  economy  and  simulated 
scenario  1,  when  government  spends  beyond  the  fiscal  rule.  From  which  we  can  conclude  that  the 
government accomplishment of fiscal rule, represented by scenario 2, reduces debt volatility.

Productivity and fiscal shocks response functions reaction analysis  

In  this  section,  we  discuss  the  results  from  the  reaction  of  response  functions  when  introduced 
productivity and taxes shocks. In a time horizon of forty quarters, we analyze the scenarios 1 and 2, when 
government spends beyond the Public Expenses Limit Rule and when government spends below the rule.

The goal here is to evaluate the fiscal primary result and the government gross debt trajectories dynamic 
in different fiscal postures related to exogenous shocks.  

3.3.1 Scenarios with              and                

As  we  already  defined  before,  in  scenario  1  government  spends  3%  beyond  the  limit  while  in 
 
scenario  2  it  spends  3%  bellow.  The  figures  4,  5  and  6  express  the  different  variables  responses  when 
exogenous shocks on productivity and taxes are introduced. 

 
Figure  4  express  both  scenarios  behavior  when  productive  shock  is  introduced  to  the  model.  As 
standard, the theory appoints that a productive shock impel positive effects on product, consumption and 
investment. Not only, generates rebounds on fiscal variables improving the public finances as a function 
of taxes revenues expansion. The response functions corroborate with literature, as the GDP, consumption 
and investment level reactions are positive to a productive shock, and it is reinforced by the endogenous 
effect on monetary basis growth. 

The  interest12,  by  its  side,  positively  respond  to  inflation  rate  increase  and  stabilized  from  fifth 
 
period. This relation between inflation and interest rate are similar in all emulated scenarios. According to 
De Resende and Rebei (2008), this result indicates that indirect endogenous effect dominates exogenous 
productivity shock. In this case, we understand that the first is a function of monetary expansion while the 
second refers to technological shock propagation, which results in a net inflation increase.

We  can  see  in  Figure  4  that  in  a  scenario  when  public  expenses  limit  rule  are  not  enforced,  the 
variables  related  to  fiscal  policy  (government  primary  result  and  public  debt)  presents  a  irregular 
behavior.  We  noticed  that  primary  deficit  suffers  an  expressive  expansion  and  stabilizes  only  on  the 
fifteenth period after the productive shock while the government debt presents a positive response to the 
shock and starts to fall only from the same period. 

 
On the other hand, when government spend 3% bellow the established by the rule, we visualize a 
primary surplus with  growth in  the first  five quarters after the shock. Public Debt  presents  a significant 
retraction  and  maintains  its  trajectory  below  the  steady  state  level  through  all  the  period,  showing  the 
importance of fiscal rule respect. Also, in this scenario, when the shock is on consumption taxes and not 

                                                           
12 As can be noticed the monetary authority posture characterize a low fiscal dominance regime in the simulations. This can be 
identified as monetary authority assumes a active posture increasing interest in response to inflation. 

on productivity taxes, GDP is not negatively affected but presents some volatility and stabilizes above the 
stationary  state  only  after  twelfth  period.  This  GDP  expansion  dynamics  can  be  explained  from  the 
endogenous  government  expenses  growth,  which  dominates  the  direct  effect  of  the  taxes  exogenous 
shock positively affecting the aggregate demand.

On a scenario when the shock corresponds to income and not consumption taxes, we can see on 
 
Figure  6  that  variables  dynamics  is  modified  principally  on  the  scenario  1,  where  government  does  not 
follow  the  Public  Expenses  Limit  Rule.  A  drastically  investment  reduction  is  followed  by  a  GDP 
reduction,  indicating  the  effects  of  productivity  and  capital  profitability  retraction.  Consumption  is  also 
strongly affected, as disposable income is lower, the wealth effective is negative and remains bellow the 
stationary state through all the period. So, we can conclude that on this scenario the dynamics of this three 
variables have been negatively affected after the taxes shock on income.

Comparing Figures 5 and 6 and evaluating the fiscal  variables dynamics behavior on scenario 1, 
 
seems clear to us that on both types of shock we have a deterioration on fiscal balance outlook. As we can 
see,  surplus  and  debt  walks  on  opposite  directions.  Contrarily,  on  scenario  2,  where  government  more 
than accomplish the expenses limit  rule, the primary result increases, the indebt level  decreases and the 
fiscal balance equilibrates. This means that even when we have a taxes expansion, this is not enough to 
equilibrate  public  budget  if  the  Public  Expenses  Limit  Rule  is  not  followed.  Therefore,  in  all  analyzed 
scenarios, an adjustment on government budget through an expenses limit rule is a relevant mechanism to 
the stability and sustainability of the public debt in the long run. 

4.CONCLUSION 

The present article have as its goal analyze the government debt level trajectory in distinct fiscal 
scenarios associated to the expenses limit rule and exogenous shocks on taxes and productivity at a low 
fiscal dominance regime within the structure of a DSGE model. 

On model structure we taking in account the nominal prices rigidity hypothesis and considered a 
set of political rules. In relation to this, we used a long-term fiscal policy rule based on De Resende and 
Rebei  (2008)  assuming  that  some  part  of  the  government  constant  debt  has  to  be  backed  up  by  the 
primary surplus value. Not only, the other part of this debt has to be backed up by seigniorage revenue. 

In  respect  to  the  theoretical  model  contribution,  this  one  incorporates  some  innovation  when 
comparing to the original model, mainly in the government action respect. We include a fiscal policy rule 
limiting public expenses based on PEC 55/241. Distinctively from De Resende and Rebei (2008) model, 
the government expenses were assumed as endogenous from the intertemporal optimization problem, in a 
way  that  government  decision  from  the  utility  function  were  restricted  to  the  new  rule  based  on  the 
parameter   .   

The presented results came from the response functions reaction to each exogenous shock relating 
them  to  the  different  government  fiscal  posture.  In  all  stochastic  shocks  the  non-respect  of  public 
expenses limit rule negatively reflects on fiscal variables. Specifically on this scenario, the reactions show 
an expressive fall on primary fiscal result and consequently the government indebt growth. 

From what we conclude that even with some positive effects derivate from productivity and taxes 
shocks  on  fiscal  balance,  the  result  point  in  the  direction  of  a  government  necessity  in  accomplish  the 
public expenses limit rule in a way to stabilize the public debt. The use of a limit rule on public expenses 
shows consistent effects on the indebt level stabilization.
