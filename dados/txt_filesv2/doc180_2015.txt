Abstract 
This  paper  extends  Evans  and  Jovanovic  (1989)’s  entrepreneurship  model  to  incorporate  the 
informal sector. Specifically, entrepreneurs can operate either in the formal sector  – in which they 
have  limited  access  to  credit  markets,  but  have  to  pay  taxes  –  or  in  the  informal  sector  –  in 
which they can avoid paying taxes, but have no access to credit markets. In addition, technology in 
the informal sector is both less productive and more labor intensive than that in the formal sector. 
We calibrate the model to the Brazilian economy, and evaluate the impact of credit frictions and 
taxation  on  occupational  choices,  aggregate  output  and  inequality.  Removing  all  distortions  can 
improve aggregate efficiency considerably, largely because this induces entrepreneurs to switch to the 
formal sector, where technology is superior. Most of this effect comes from removing credit market 
frictions, but taxes on formal businesses are also important. The elimination of distortions can also 
reduce inequality, but this comes from credit constraints and labor income taxation. Reducing taxes 
on formal businesses actually increases inequality in the model.

Resumo 
Este  trabalho  busca  incorporar  a  coexistência  de  um  setor  informal  ao  modelo  de  Evans  e 
Jovanovic  (1989).  Empreendedores  podem  operar  no  setor  formal  –  com  acesso  limitado  ao 
mercado  de  crédito  e  sujeitos  a  cobrança  de  impostos  –  ou  no  setor  informal  –  evitando  a 
tributação,  mas  sem  acesso  a  crédito.  Adicionalmente,  a  tecnologia  no  setor  informal  é  menos 
produtiva e mais intensiva em trabalho. O modelo é calibrado com base em dados da economia 
brasileira. Avaliam-se os efeitos de restrições no mercado de crédito e tributos sobre as escolhas 
ocupacionais, produção agregada e desigualdade. Remover todas as distorções melhora a eficiência 
agregada  de  maneira  considerável,  principalmente  por  conta  da  migração  de  agentes  para  o 
empreendedorismo formal, que opera com uma tecnologia superior. A restrição de crédito possui o 
maior  efeito,  mas  os  impostos  sobre  empresas  formais  também  possuem  papel  importante.  A 
eliminação  de  distorções  também  permite  reduzir  a  desigualdade  de  renda,  sendo  que  tal  efeito 
advém da restrição de crédito e de impostos sobre a renda do trabalhado. Diminuir impostos sobre 
empreendimentos formais provoca elevação da desigualdade no modelo.

1 Introduction

Large informal sectors are a distinctive feature of developing economies.1 Firms operate
informally as a means of avoiding regulations and taxation. However, there are costs
to this action, such as lack of access to formal credit markets and to the legal system.
Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that (cid:133)rms in the informal sector are also less
productive (De Paula and Scheinkman, 2006).

In the present paper, we explore some elements of this tradeo⁄ by embedding a
standard entrepreneurship model (Evans and Jovanovic, 1989) with an informal sector.
Speci(cid:133)cally, there are two sectors: the formal sector and the informal sector.
In the
formal sector, entrepreneurs have imperfect access to credit markets and have to pay
taxes, while in the informal sector they can evade the payment of taxes but are barred
from credit markets. Furthermore, technology is less e¢ cient and more labor intensive
in the informal sector.

Agents are heterogeneous in their entrepreneurial talent and wealth. Based on this,
they decide between three occupations: wage working, entrepreneurship in the formal
sector and entrepreneurship in the informal sector. Di⁄erently from Evans and Jovanovic,
we also allow wages to be endogenous, which gives rise to nontrivial e⁄ects on income
distribution.2 We calibrate the model to approximate features of the Brazilian econ-
omy, and evaluate the e⁄ects of taxation and credit constraints on e¢ ciency (aggregate
output), formalization and inequality.

Taken together, the frictions included in the model are able to generate substantial
ine¢ ciency. Particularly, in our basic calibration, aggregate output is 30 percent below
that of an undistorted economy. Most of this e⁄ect comes from credit constraints on
formal entrepreneurs: removing this friction (holding taxes constant) reduces the level
of ine¢ ciency to less than 3 percent. Taxation on formal businesses also has an important
impact on output: ine¢ ciency is nearly halved when we equal such taxes to zero. These
e⁄ects come largely from the migration of entrepreneurs from the informal to the formal
sector, where productivity is higher.

We also evaluate how taxes on labor income (uniform across sectors) a⁄ect total
output. Reducing such taxes can actually make the economy less e¢ cient (although the
e⁄ect is small in magnitude), since it lowers gross wages, thus making the informal sector
(which is labor intensive) more attractive.

Removing all frictions also reduces income inequality in the model. This e⁄ect is
attributed to relaxing borrowing constraints and lowering labor income taxes, which

1See, for instance, Schneider (2005).
2Gasperini (2010) also considers endogenous wages in Evans and Jovanovic(cid:146)s model.

contribute to raise wages (the e⁄ects on income inequality are basically driven by the
behavior of wages, since most of the individuals in the model choose wage working).
Eliminating taxes on formal businesses raises inequality, since it stimulates the migration
of (cid:133)rms to the formal sector (less labor intensive), thus lowering labor demand.

Our work is related to a large literature that evaluates the e⁄ect of credit market
frictions on entrepreneurship (see for instance Evans and Jovanovic, 1989; Blanch(cid:135)ower
and Oswald, 1998; Paulson and Townsend, 2004; Buera, 2008). Our main contribution
is to add two di⁄erent sectors (formal and informal) to the classic model of Evans and
Jovanovic. This allows us to analyze not only the e⁄ect of credit constraints, but also
of taxation. Moreover, these e⁄ects can be larger than in a model with a single sec-
tor, since changes in parameters induce individuals to switch sectors that have di⁄erent
technologies.

The focus on e¢ ciency is motivated by the literature on misallocation (Hsieh and
Klenow, 2007; Restuccia and Rogerson, 2008), especially Jeong and Townsend (2007) and
Banerjee and Moll (2010), which analyze the e⁄ect of credit market frictions on aggregate
productivity. Regarding the e⁄ect on inequality, our work is particularly related to
Cagetti and De Nardi (2006). Once more, considering the informal sector can amplify
the e⁄ect of such frictions, since they in(cid:135)uence the sector (and therefore technology) in
which individuals choose to operate. The present study is also related to papers that
model the informal sector, such as Rauch (1991), Amaral and Quintin (2006) and De
Paula and Scheinkman (2009).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section
3 explains how the model was calibrated to the Brazilian economy. Section 4 presents
simulations regarding changes in credit frictions and taxation, and analyzes the e⁄ects
on e¢ ciency, occupational choice and inequality. Section 5 concludes.

2 Model

Our starting point is the model proposed by Evans and Jovanovic (1989). Speci(cid:133)cally,
there is a set of individuals, heterogeneous on their wealth and entrepreneurial talent.
Each of them chooses either to be an entrepreneur or a wage worker. To become an
entrepreneur, the individual may need to borrow resources. The presence of borrowing
constraints then implies that occupational choice depends not only on entrepreneurial
talent, but also on wealth.

We add to Evans and Jovanovic (1989) by introducing two di⁄erent sectors in which
the entrepreneur can operate: the formal sector and the informal sector. In the former,

2

the entrepreneur may borrow a limited amount of resources to (cid:133)nance her business but
has to pay taxes, whereas in the informal sector the individual can evade the payment of
taxes, but has to rely exclusively on her wealth (she has no access to credit markets). We
consider a small open economy, so that the interest rate is exogenously (cid:133)xed. Nonethe-
less, di⁄erently from Evans and Jovanovic (1989), wages are set according to a market
clearing condition.

2.1 Technology

There is a continuum of mass 1 of individuals, which are heterogeneous in two dimensions:
entrepreneurial talent (cid:150) (cid:18) 2 [0;1) (cid:150)and wealth (cid:150) z 2 [0;1). They are distributed in
the population according to the pdf f ((cid:18); z). Output is homogeneous and may be either
produced in the formal sector or in the informal sector. An entrepreneur of talent (cid:18)
operating in the formal sector combines capital (Kf ) and labor (Lf ) to generate output
using the following technology:

Yf = (cid:18)(cid:0)K (cid:11)

f L1(cid:0)(cid:11)

f

(cid:1)(cid:13)

where (cid:13) 2 (0; 1) is a span of control parameter, as in Lucas (1978). For this same
entrepreneur, production in the informal sector is given by:

Yi =  (cid:18)(cid:16)K (cid:12)

i L1(cid:0)(cid:12)

i (cid:17)(cid:13)

where Ki and Li stand for the amounts of capital and labor employed the entrepreneur
in this sector, and   is a parameter that does not depend on (cid:18). We assume 0 <   < 1
and (cid:12) < (cid:11), that is, production in the informal sector is both less productive and more
labor intensive.3

2.2 The formal sector

If a person decides to be an entrepreneur in the formal sector, she may need external
funds to (cid:133)nance her capital. However, there are credit constraints: an agent can borrow
up to a multiple of her wealth. Speci(cid:133)cally, an individual with wealth z is able to
borrow at most ((cid:21) (cid:0) 1)z, where (cid:21) 2 [1;1) is a parameter that measures how lax is the
borrowing constraint. The entrepreneur then has this amount plus her own wealth (cid:150)
that is, ((cid:21) (cid:0) 1)z + z = (cid:21)z (cid:150)available for investment. This implies that the capital stock
employed by her (cid:133)rm (Kf ) cannot exceed (cid:21)z.

3We follow Amaral and Quintin (2006) when assuming that the informal sector is labor intensive.

3

Net earnings of a formal entrepreneur with wealth z and talent (cid:18) are given by:

(cid:25)f ((cid:18); z) = max

Kf ;Lff(1 (cid:0) (cid:28) f )(cid:18)(cid:0)K (cid:11)

f L1(cid:0)(cid:11)

f

(cid:1)(cid:13)

(cid:0) wLf (cid:0) r(Kf (cid:0) z) + T :

0 (cid:20) Kf (cid:20) (cid:21)zg

where (cid:28) f is the tax rate on output (if produced in the formal sector), w is the wage
rate, r (cid:0) 1 is the real interest rate and T is a lump-sum transfer. Tax revenues are
distributed uniformly across the population in a lump-sum fashion. In other words, T
depends neither on the person(cid:146)s characteristics, nor on her occupation. If the borrowing
constraint does not bind (unconstrained entrepreneur), optimality conditions imply that:

K(cid:3)f u = "
L(cid:3)f u = "

1(cid:0)(cid:13)

(cid:13)(cid:18)(1 (cid:0) (cid:28) f )

1(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:1)(1(cid:0)(cid:11))(cid:13)# 1
(cid:0) r
(cid:11)(cid:1)1(cid:0)(1(cid:0)(cid:11))(cid:13)(cid:0) w
1(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:1)1(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:13)# 1
(cid:11)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:13)(cid:0) w
(cid:0) r

(cid:13)(cid:18)(1 (cid:0) (cid:28) f )

1(cid:0)(cid:13)

which are the amounts of capital and labor chosen by an unconstrained entrepreneur. In
this case, the individual uses the e¢ cient quantities of both inputs, and her choice does
not depend on wealth. On the other hand, if the entrepreneur is constrained, we have
that:

K(cid:3)f c = (cid:21)z

L(cid:3)f c = (cid:20)(cid:13)(cid:18)(1 (cid:0) (cid:28) f )(1 (cid:0) (cid:11))((cid:21)z)(cid:11)(cid:13)

w

(cid:21)

1

1(cid:0)(cid:11)(1(cid:0)(cid:13))

Therefore, if the constraint binds, the entrepreneur(cid:146)s wealth a⁄ects the scale of her
enterprise. The optimal choice of inputs by an entrepreneur in the formal sector can
then be expressed as:

K(cid:3)f = (cid:26)(cid:21)z; if K(cid:3)f u > (cid:21)z
L(cid:3)f = (cid:26)L(cid:3)f c; if K(cid:3)f u > (cid:21)z

K(cid:3)f u, otherwise

L(cid:3)f u, otherwise

2.3 The informal sector

The entrepreneur in the informal sector has a problem analogous to that in the formal
sector with two key di⁄erences: (i) she can evade the payment of taxes ((cid:28) f = 0), and
(ii) she has no access to credit markets, having only her own wealth to use as capital
((cid:21) = 1). Net earnings are thus given by:

(cid:25)i((cid:18); z) = max

Ki;Lif(cid:18) (cid:16)K (cid:12)

i L1(cid:0)(cid:12)

i (cid:17)(cid:13)

(cid:0) wLi (cid:0) r(Ki (cid:0) z) + T :

0 (cid:20) Ki (cid:20) zg

4

The optimal choice of inputs by an unconstrained entrepreneur is then:

1
1(cid:0)(cid:13)

K(cid:3)iu = 264
L(cid:3)iu = 264

(cid:13) (cid:18)

1(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:17)(1(cid:0)(cid:12))(cid:13)375
(cid:16) r
(cid:12)(cid:17)1(cid:0)(1(cid:0)(cid:12))(cid:13)(cid:16) w
1(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:17)1(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:13)375
(cid:12)(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:16) w
(cid:16) r

(cid:13) (cid:18)

1
1(cid:0)(cid:13)

while a constrained entrepreneur chooses:

K(cid:3)ic = z

L(cid:3)ic = (cid:20) (cid:13) (cid:18)(1 (cid:0) (cid:11))z(cid:12)(cid:13)

w

1

1(cid:0)(cid:12)(1(cid:0)(cid:13))

(cid:21)

The optimal decision of an entrepreneur in the informal sector is then summarized

by:

K(cid:3)i = (cid:26) z; if K(cid:3)iu > z
L(cid:3)f = (cid:26)L(cid:3)ic; if K(cid:3)iu > z

K(cid:3)iu, otherwise

L(cid:3)iu, otherwise

2.4 Wage worker

A person who decides to be a wage worker receives the wage (net of taxes), the lump-
sum transfer and interest on her wealth, which is lent to entrepreneurs that need external
funds. Each wage worker supplies one unit of time inelastically. In other words, labor
income does not depend on entrepreneurial talent. Following Amaral and Quintin (2006),
we suppose no segmentation in the labor market, so that wages are equalized across
sectors. Net earnings of a wage worker with wealth z are then:

where (cid:28) n is the tax rate on labor income.4

(cid:25)w(z) = (1 (cid:0) (cid:28) n)w + rz + T

4In the model (cid:28) f drives the wedge across sectors. We assume that the tax on labor income is uniform
across sectors (that is, it has to be paid independently of the sector the worker chooses), so that (cid:28) n does
not capture this wedge as well.

5

2.5 Equilibrium

The decision of each agent is static. Given talent and wealth, she chooses the occupation
which gives her the highest net income: wage worker, entrepreneur in the formal sector, or
entrepreneur in the informal sector. Therefore, (cid:25)((cid:18); z) = maxf(cid:25)f ((cid:18); z); (cid:25)i((cid:18); z); (cid:25)w(z)g
are the net earnings of an individual with wealth z and talent (cid:18). The fraction of agents
opting for each occupation j 2 ff; i; wg is:

Oj =Z Z 1f(cid:25)((cid:18); z) = (cid:25)j((cid:18); z)gf ((cid:18); z)d(cid:18)dz

where the subscripts f, i and w stand for entrepreneur in the formal sector, entrepreneur
in informal sector and wage worker, respectively. The equilibrium wage is such that:

Of + Oi + Ow = 1

and that the supply of labor from wage workers (left-hand side of the equation below) is
equal to the demand for labor from formal and informal entrepreneurs (right-hand side):

Ow =Z Z 1f(cid:25)((cid:18); z) = (cid:25)f ((cid:18); z)gL(cid:3)f f ((cid:18); z)d(cid:18)dz +Z Z 1f(cid:25)((cid:18); z) = (cid:25)i((cid:18); z)gL(cid:3)i f ((cid:18); z)d(cid:18)dz

Furthermore, since tax revenues are transferred back uniformly to the agents, we

have that:

T =Z Z 1f(cid:25)((cid:18); z) = (cid:25)f ((cid:18); z)g(cid:28) f (cid:18)(cid:0)K(cid:3)(cid:11)

f L(cid:3)1(cid:0)(cid:11)

f

(cid:1)(cid:13) f ((cid:18); z)d(cid:18)dz + Ow(cid:28) nw

where the terms on the right-hand side are the proceeds from taxation on formal entre-
preneurs and on labor income, respectively.

3 Calibration

Our main objective is to understand the e⁄ects of taxation and borrowing constraints
on occupation choice, aggregate e¢ ciency and inequality, in an environment in which a
signi(cid:133)cant fraction of output is produced in the informal sector. To do so, we calibrate
the model to approximate some features of the Brazilian economy. Along with values
for the model(cid:146)s parameters, we need functional forms for the distributions of wealth and
entrepreneurial talent.

3.1 Parameter values

Table 1 presents our baseline calibration for the model(cid:146)s parameters. Some of these
values were chosen in conformity with the literature, while others were set to replicate
features of the Brazilian economy. Speci(cid:133)cally, we choose (cid:21) = 2 for our borrowing
constraint parameter, which means that the amount borrowed by a formal entrepreneur
cannot be larger than the value of her own wealth. This value is in line with Paulson,
Townsend and Karaivanov (2006)(cid:146)s study on the Thai economy. Buera (2008) and Evans
and Jovanovic (1989) use similar values for the U.S.

As for the production parameters, we follow Gollin (2002) and Buera (2008) and
set (cid:11) = 0:35. The analogous parameter for the informal sector is (cid:12) = 0:25 (Amaral
and Quintin, 2006; Pessoa and Pessoa, 2006). We choose (cid:13) = 0:65 for the span of
control parameter, which is close to the value used by Hsieh and Klenow (2007). The
parameter   is set at 0:7. This value guarantees that both sectors are active in our
baseline calibration.

Tax rates on wages and formal output were set at (cid:28) n = 0:176 and (cid:28) f = 0:345.
These values were estimated by Pereira and Ellery (2011) for the Brazilian economy.
Finally, based on the average Brazilian real interest rate between 2003 and 2009, we set
r = 1:0795.5

5To calculate the annual real interest rate, we use the short-term nominal interest rate (SELIC) in
annual terms, targeted by Brazilian Central Bank for monetary policy purposes, minus the annual rate
of CPI in(cid:135)ation (IPCA).

3.1.1 Distribution of wealth and entrepreneurial talent

We suppose that wealth and talent are independently distributed. Regarding wealth, we
z). The standard deviation (cid:27)z can
choose a log-normal distribution, i.e., log z (cid:24) N ((cid:22)z; (cid:27)2
be mapped into the Gini index through the following formula:
Gini = 2(cid:8)((cid:27)z=p2) (cid:0) 1

where (cid:8)((cid:1)) is the cdf of the normal distribution. To our knowledge there are no wealth
surveys in Brazil, which could provide direct estimates of the wealth Gini index. Davies
et al (2011) use data from countries with wealth surveys to project the wealth Gini
of other countries. For Brazil, their estimate is 0:784. We use this value to calibrate
(cid:27)z = 1:75.

Entrepreneurial talent is an unobservable variable. Our strategy is to assume a
uniform distribution (cid:150) (cid:18) (cid:24) U (0; A) (cid:150) and calibrate the parameter A, along with the
parameter (cid:22)z from the wealth distribution, using statistics from the Brazilian economy.
Speci(cid:133)cally, for several combinations of A and (cid:22)z, we simulate the model and compute
the following objects: (i) share of informal output in GDP, (ii) share of wage workers
in population, and (iii) share of wages in GDP. From the data, we approximate (i)
using the Underground Economy Index (˝ndice de Economia Subterr(cid:226)nea), from the
Getulio Vargas Foundation. The share of wage workers in the population comes from
the Brazilian Household Survey and corresponds to the fraction of employees on total
employment. Finally, the share of wages in GDP comes from the Brazilian National
Accounts. Table 2 summarizes these statistics. We target averages between 2003 and
2009, since all three statistics are available in this period.

For each pair ((cid:22)z; A) we simulate the model and compute (i)-(iii), along with the
squared di⁄erence between each of these objects and their corresponding values in the
data, as displayed in Table 2. We choose the pair which minimizes the sum of such
squared di⁄erences. This yields A = 30 and (cid:22)z = 0:26, and completes our calibration.

4 Simulations

Our simulations are based on a random draw of 100,000 individuals from the distributions
of talent and wealth described above. Before turning to the quantitative implications of
the model, we provide some intuition on its inner workings, particularly regarding the
e⁄ects of credit constraints and taxation on occupational choice.

Figure 1(a) plots agents according to their characteristics and occupational choices,
in an environment with no taxes ((cid:28) f = (cid:28) n = 0) and no credit constraints on formal
entrepreneurs ((cid:21) = 1).
In this case, all entrepreneurs operate in the formal sector.
Moreover, occupational choice depends only on talent: if (cid:18) is su¢ ciently high, the indi-
vidual becomes an entrepreneur; otherwise, she chooses to be a wage worker. All Figures
are in the Appendix.

Figure 1(b) introduces the borrowing constraint on formal entrepreneurs. We keep
tax rates at zero, so that it is still not optimal to operate in the informal sector. This is
the case studied by Evans and Jovanovic (the only di⁄erence here is that wages are en-
dogenous). Now occupational choice depends on wealth as well as talent. In particular,
there are two margins of ine¢ ciency entailed by the borrowing constraint: (i) the inten-
sive margin, that is, individuals with high (cid:18) and low z become constrained entrepreneurs
and have to operate at scales lower than optimal, and (ii) the extensive margin, that is,
some of these high-talent individuals prefer to become wage workers. These e⁄ects also
reduce the demand for labor and, therefore, equilibrium wages.

Figure 2 introduces, in addition to credit constraints, the second source of friction in
the model: taxes on formal entrepreneurs and on labor income. Now the informal sector
becomes pro(cid:133)table for some individuals, since they can avoid paying taxes. In particular,
for a given level of wealth, the least talented individuals opt for wage working. Increases
in talent then induce individuals to become informal entrepreneurs: since their scale is
relatively low, they prefer to operate informally in spite of not having access to credit
markets. Further increases in (cid:18) (for the same level of z) are then related to larger scale:
access to credit markets becomes essential, thus inducing such individuals to operate in
the formal sector.

Table 3 presents some descriptive statistics about our calibrated economy. About 65

9

percent of all individuals are wage workers, and 18 percent are entrepreneurs operating
in the formal sector. The informal sector employs the majority of workers (52.1%), but
produces only 22 percent of the output in this economy. This is because such sector
is both more labor intensive and less productive than the formal sector. Wage workers
are the least talented individual of this economy, while formal entrepreneurs are slightly
more talented than informal ones on average. Nonetheless, informal entrepreneurs are
wealthier, especially those unconstrained: since these individuals do not need to borrow
to operate at the optimal scale, they choose the informal sector in order to avoid paying
taxes.

4.1 Implications for e¢ ciency

To measure e¢ ciency, we compare our model(cid:146)s total output (formal and informal) to
that of an economy with no distortions. Speci(cid:133)cally, let Y ((cid:21); (cid:28) f ; (cid:28) n) be the total output
of an economy with parameters (cid:21); (cid:28) f and (cid:28) n. Output in the absence of distortions is
given by Y (1; 0; 0). We de(cid:133)ne e¢ ciency gap as 1 (cid:0) Y ((cid:21); (cid:28) f ; (cid:28) n)=Y (1; 0; 0).

Table 4 displays the e¢ ciency gap for selected combinations of tax rates and borrow-
ing constraint parameters. In column (1), both tax rates are zero. Column (2) considers
the case in which taxes on formal output are null, but the tax rate on labor income is
positive. Column (3) does the opposite, i.e., allows taxes on formal output to be pos-
itive, but keeps taxes on labor income at zero. Finally, in column (4) both tax rates
are positive. As for the borrowing constraint parameter, along with our calibrated value
((cid:21) = 2), we consider two extreme situations: (cid:21) = 1 (that is, without such constraint)
and (cid:21) = 1 (that is, no access to credit markets, even for formal entrepreneurs).6

6In all exercises, informal entreprenuers have no access to credit markets.

The e¢ ciency gap of our calibrated economy is highlighted in bold. The combination
of taxes and borrowing constraints generates an e¢ ciency loss of 30 percent, relative to an
economy with no distortions. Most of this e⁄ect is attributed to borrowing constraints:
the e¢ ciency loss is reduced to 2.8 percent, when we make such constraint unimportant
(that is, when (cid:21) is increased from 2 to in(cid:133)nity), while keeping tax rates constant.

Though smaller in magnitude, the e⁄ect of taxes on total output is also substantial:
the e¢ ciency loss is nearly halved when one makes both tax rates equal to zero, but keeps
(cid:21) = 2 (column (4) versus column (1)). This e⁄ect is basically driven by taxes on formal
output (column (4) versus column (2)). When one reduces only the tax rate on labor
income to zero (column (4) versus column (3)), the e¢ ciency gap actually increases.
This is because the fall in (cid:28) n lowers gross wages, thus making the informal sector (which
is labor intensive) more attractive. In other words, some entrepreneurs migrate to the
informal sector, which is also less productive, leading to a fall in total output.

Notice that this negative e⁄ect of (cid:28) n is absent in the extreme situations (cid:21) = 1
and (cid:21) = 1. The reason is that, in these cases, the movement of entrepreneurs across
sectors is severely reduced. For instance, when (cid:21) = 1, there is no incentive to operate
formally, since entrepreneurs do not have access to credit markets in either sector (but
in the informal sector they do not pay taxes). Therefore, changes in (cid:28) n will not entail
movements of individuals across sectors. Similarly, when (cid:21) = 1, there is little incentive
to operate informally, which reduces the mass of entrepreneurs reacting to an increase
in (cid:28) n.7

In what follows, we provide further detail on the mechanisms behind the e⁄ects tax

rates and the borrowing constraint parameter on e¢ ciency.

7In these cases, a high (cid:28) n leads to ine¢ ciency because it distorts the choice between wage working

and entreprenuership.

4.1.1 Changes in (cid:21)

We now analyze the impacts of changing the borrowing constraint parameter on formal-
ization and e¢ ciency. Figure 3 displays percentage changes in total output, as well as
formal and informal output (relative to our baseline calibration, i.e., (cid:21) = 2). Increasing
(cid:21) implies that individuals in the formal sector have more access to credit. This sector,
as a result, becomes more attractive, leading to a decrease in informal output. Total
output rises because of two channels: (i) the intensive margin, that is, individuals that
maintain their status of formal entrepreneurs (constrained) and can expand their scale
since there is more credit available, and (ii) the extensive margin, that is, individuals
that switch from the other two occupations and become formal entrepreneurs.

Table 4 decomposes the impact on total output into these two margins.8 We also
show the share of output produced in the informal sector, as well as the share of each
occupation in the population. For instance, raising (cid:21) from 2 to 2.5 leads to a 20 percent
increase in total output; the share of informal sector decreases from 22 to 15.4%. This
e⁄ect comes mostly from the extensive margin, i.e., from individuals that become formal
entrepreneurs as a result of an increase (cid:21) (cid:150) speci(cid:133)cally from entrepreneurs that leave
the informal sector, since the share of wage workers is relatively constant across di⁄erent
values of (cid:21).

8To calculate the intensive margin, we add the change in output across entreprenuers that did not
alter their occupational choices as a result of a di⁄erent value for (cid:21). The intensive margin is the change
in production from entreprenuers that did alter their status.

12

4.1.2 Changes in (cid:28) f

Table 5 and Figure 4 perform a similar exercise, but for changes in (cid:28) f . As a result of
increasing taxes on formal businesses, some individuals (cid:133)nd more pro(cid:133)table to operate
informally. Therefore, output in the informal sector rises at the expense of output in the
formal sector. Moreover, nearly 100% of such e⁄ect comes from the extensive margin.
Notice that the model is quite sensitive in this dimension. For instance, if (cid:28) f rises
by 0.5 percentage points, the informal sector share in total output jumps from 22 to
31.6%.9 Total output falls as a result, as some entrepreneurs switch to a less productive
technology when they move to the informal sector. The share of wage workers also
increases in response to higher taxation on formal entrepreneurs. This is because the
expansion of the informal sector (which is labor intensive) is associated with an increase
in wages. As a result, some individuals switch to this occupation.

4.1.3 Changes in (cid:28) n

Table 6 and Figure 5 exhibit results regarding changes in labor income taxation. As
previously noted, an increase in (cid:28) n raises e¢ ciency, because it makes gross wages higher
and, as a result, reduces relative pro(cid:133)tability in the informal sector (which is more labor
intensive). This induces some entrepreneurs to move to the formal sector, where the
technology is more productive. This e⁄ect appears in the extensive margin, which is
positive for increases in (cid:28) n. The intensive margin, nonetheless, goes in the opposite

9For this reason, we chose values of (cid:28) f very close to each other in Table 5.

13

direction, since entrepreneurs that do not switch sectors face higher costs, thus reducing
their scale. Moreover, net wages fall, thus reducing the share of individuals that opt for
wage working.

In spite of the e¢ ciency gains, increasing labor taxation worsens income inequality
in the model, since most individuals are wage workers. In the following subsession, we
discuss the distributional e⁄ects of changes in taxation and in the borrowing constraint
parameter.

4.2 Implications for inequality

We measure inequality by the income Gini coe¢ cient, which is equal to 0.469 in our
baseline calibration. In other words, the model is able to generate considerable inequality,
despite not featuring di⁄erences in labor productivity (in the data, the average Brazilian
Gini index is equal to 0.562 during the 2003-2009 period). Table 7 is analogous to Table
4, but shows the impact of tax rates and the borrowing constraint parameter on income
inequality in the model. As in the case of e¢ ciency, the highest reduction in inequality
occurs when one eliminates the credit market friction (that is, comparing (cid:21) = 2 and
(cid:21) = 1 in column (4)). Inequality also falls when we make the tax rate on labor income
equal to zero (column (4) versus column (3)), but rises when we set the tax on formal
enterprises at zero (column (4) versus column (2)).

Furthermore, notice that the parameter (cid:21) has a non-monotonic e⁄ect on the Gini
coe¢ cient: raising (cid:21) from 1 to 2 increases income inequality, but increasing (cid:21) further
to in(cid:133)nity reduces this index. The relationship follows an inverted-U, where inequality
peaks at (cid:21) roughly equal to 2.2.

This follows because (cid:21) has two contradicting e⁄ects on wages (and, therefore, in-
equality, since most individuals choose wage working in this economy). On the one
hand, relaxing borrowing constraints boosts labor demand, as (cid:133)rms in the formal sector
are able to reach larger scales of production. On the other hand, the increase in (cid:21) induces
movements of entrepreneurs from the informal to the formal sector, which lowers labor
demand since informal (cid:133)rms operate a labor-intensive technology. When (cid:21) is close to
one (and all output is produced in the informal sector), the second e⁄ect dominates. As
(cid:21) increases further, the (cid:133)rst e⁄ect becomes more important.

A smaller tax rate on labor income lowers e¢ ciency, but reduces inequality, since the
net wage falls in response to higher (cid:28) n. The opposite occurs for reductions in (cid:28) f : this
stimulates the migration from the informal to the formal sector, which increases total
output but reduces the wage (since the informal sector is labor intensive).

5 Concluding remarks

This paper analyzed the e⁄ect of taxation and credit market frictions on occupational
choice, aggregate e¢ ciency and income inequality, in an environment where a large
fraction of output is produced in the informal sector. In particular, we extended the
model of Evans and Jovanovic (1989) to consider two sectors: the formal sector, in
which entrepreneurs have limited access to credit markets, but have to pay taxes; and

15

the informal sector, in which entrepreneurs can evade the payment of taxes, but have to
rely exclusively on their wealth to (cid:133)nance their capital. Individuals are heterogeneous on
their wealth and entrepreneurial talent, and have to decide between three occupations:
wage worker, entrepreneur in the formal and entrepreneur in the informal sector.
In
addition, the informal sector is both less productive and more labor intensive than the
formal sector.

The model is calibrated to approximate features of the Brazilian economy in the
2000s. For our baseline parameters, the frictions included in the model are able to
generate a considerable degree of ine¢ ciency: total output is 30 percent below that
of an economy with no distortions. This is largely attributed to credit frictions, but
taxes on formal businesses are also important. Relaxing such frictions can the have a
considerable impact on total output, mostly because it induces entrepreneurs to switch
to the formal sector, which features a superior technology.

Regarding income distribution, removing all frictions also reduces inequality. This
comes from relaxing borrowing constraints and lowering taxes on labor income. Lowering
taxes on formal businesses improves aggregate e¢ ciency, but worsens income inequality.
