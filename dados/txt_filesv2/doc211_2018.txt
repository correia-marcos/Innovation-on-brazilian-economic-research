Abstract:  The  growth  of  the  elderly  population  and  the  changes  in  the  household  composition  raise 
important  questions  regarding  the  level  of  well-being  of  elderly  in  developing  countries.  Traditional 
analyzes of poverty often ignore the question of  intra-household  distribution of resources.  This  paper is 
the  first  to  apply  a  collective  consumption  model  to  analyze  the  level  of  well-being  of  the  elderly  in 
Brazil.  Our  results  indicate  considerable  economies  of  scale  associated  with  living  in  a  couple  and  a 
husband’s share that is increasing in total expenditures. We find that the decrease in material well-being 
due  the  wife’s  death  is  rather  significant  for  elderly  men  and  the  opposite  was  observed  for  elderly 
women  in  Brazil.  Finally,  we  conclude  that  disregarding  the  intra-household  distribution  of  resources 
generally means underestimating the poverty of the elderly in Brazil.

1.  Introduction 

 

The  population  ageing  process  all  over  the  world  is  a  well-acknowledged  fact.  Whereas  the 
demographic  transition  lasted  over  a  century  in  developed  countries,  these  changes  are  occurring  much 
more  quickly  in  developing  countries.  This  is  due  to  the  controlling  of  fertility  and  the  reducing  of 
mortality  rates.  According  to  Kinsella  and  He  (2009),  France  had  115  years  to  duplicate  its  elderly 
population  from  7  percent  to  14  percent;  this  relatively  slow  process  was  common  in  other  European 
nations  and  in  North  America.  Japan,  the  oldest  country  today,  was  unusual  case  in  that  this  same 
transition took place in only 26 years, from 1970 to 1996. According to the authors, most of developing 
countries  are  aging  in  the  same  rate  or  even  faster  than  Japan.  In  LAC  –  Latin  America  Countries,  for 
example,  Chile  is  transitioning  at  the  same  pace  as  Japan;  Brazil  is  projected  to  do  it  in  21  years;  and 
Colombia  in  19  years.  In  LAC  the  share  of  the  elderly  in  the  population  increased  from  around  6%  in 
1950 to more than 8% in 2000, while it is expected to reach 24% at the end of this century. This ageing 
process implies an estimate of around 200 million people older than 60 in LAC by 2050. 
 
In  addition  to  the  increase  in  the  number  of  elderly  people  in  developing  countries,  the 
composition of households in this segment of the population has also changed. There is a big increase in 
the number of elderly people living alone, especially among women. According to Gasparini et al. (2010), 
elderly  people  tend  to  live  in  households  of  smaller  size  than  younger  people.  On  average  in  LAC,  for 
example,  the  elderly  live  in  households  with  1.5  persons  less  than  the  rest  of  the  population.  This  gap 
varies  from  1  person  in  Colombia  and  Venezuela  to  around  2  in  Guatemala,  Argentina  and  Bolivia. 
According to data from the IBGE (2016), the proportion of Brazilian elderly people living alone in 2013 
was  15.1%  for  men  and  17.8%  for  women.  It  should  be  noted  that  in  1970  this  proportion  was 
approximately  5%  for  men  and  8%  for  women.  This  phenomenon,  due  to  improved  health  and  greater 
independence of the population, tends to increase in the coming decades. 

Both  the  growth  of  the  elderly  and  the  changes  in  the  household  composition  raise  important 
questions regarding the level of well-being of elderly in developing countries, like Brazil. There is great 
concern  about  their  vulnerability,  their  potential  state  of  poverty  and  the  possible  permanence  in  a  low 
level of economic well-being by the elderly. This is justified because older people are generally less likely 
to  recover  from  a  decrease  in  income  and  have  difficulties  to  (re)enter  the  labor  market,  since 
characteristics such as productivity and employability decline with age from a certain moment of life that 
often occurs around the  age of 60. Therefore, the difficulty of recovering  from  negative income  shocks 
implies that poverty among the elderly tends to be more permanent than in other groups of society (Hurd, 
1991). 
 
However, most studies that tried to understand poverty among elderly people did not consider the 
distribution  of  resources  within  the  household.  The  understanding  of  how  individual  preferences  on 
private  and  public  consumption  behave,  as  well  as  who  holds  greater  power  over  intra-household 
consumption, is crucial in analyzing the implications of welfare policy reforms and understanding issues 
such  as  poverty  among  the  elderly.  Although  common,  the  use  of  the  unitary  consumption  model2  may 
underestimate poverty in some cases and overestimate in others, depending on issues such as household 
composition, sharing of goods, and bargaining power within household. 
 
Traditional  analyzes  of  poverty  often  ignore  the  question  of  intra-household  distribution  of 
resources, assuming that all household  members consume the same amount  of goods. While there is  an 
extensive  literature  on  poverty  in  many  household  settings,  the  intra-household  implications  of  poverty 
have received little attention. Thus, the present study will be related to a growing empirical literature on 
collective  consumption  model,  intra-household  distribution  and  individual  poverty  measures.  Based  on 
the collective consumption model, it is possible to analyze poverty among the elderly, taking into account 
the potential difference in the distribution of resources between an elderly couple and an elderly person 
living  alone,  an  approach  ignored  in  the  traditional  analysis  of  poverty  among  this  segment.  Thus,  it  is 

                                                           
2  The  so-called  unitary  consumption  model  is  the  one  that  considers  the  household  as  the  unit  of  decision,  not  taking  into 
account the allocation within the household (Haddad and Kanbur, 1990).

essential to reach estimates that show an alternative approach to traditional welfare and poverty analysis 
among elderly. 
 
This alternative approach is the so-called collective consumption model, whose definition would 
be  that  a  household  is  formed  by  a  group  of  individuals,  each  of  them  having  a  well-defined  utility 
function,  and  interacting  to  generate  decisions  in  household  level.  In  these  models,  household 
consumption  data  is  used  to  retrieve  information  about  family  members.  We  must  emphasize  that  the 
international  literature on intra-household  allocation clearly shows that resources are not  equally shared 
within families3, justifying the use of the collective consumption model. 

Therefore,  the  application  of  a  collective  consumption  model  will  allow  answering  a  number  of 
important  questions  related  to  the  poverty  analysis  such  as:  on  average,  how  much  income  an  elderly 
person  living  alone  would  need  to  get  the  same  living  standards  as  when  he  was  married?  What  is  the 
percentage  of  the  couple's  expenses  that  benefits  the  elderly  men  or  the  elderly  women?  How  much 
money  does  an  elderly  couple  save  on  consumption  by  living  together  compared  to  being  in  a  single 
arrangement? These issues are  fundamental  to  analyze the  economic well-being  and poverty  among the 
elderly.  
 
Although  few  studies  have  analyzed  poverty  among  the  elderly  in  Brazil,  internationally  several 
recent  studies  have  been  carried  out  to  analyze  the  well-being  and  poverty  among  this  segment  in 
developed  countries  (Engelhardt and Gruber (2004),  Sevak et  al.  (2004), McGarry  and Schoeni  (2005), 
Zaidi (2006) and Cherchye et al. (2012)).We will try to follow closely Cherchye et al. (2012) analysis to 
Netherlands  data  and  adapt  it  to  the  Brazilian  case,  giving  that  the  demographic,  economic  and  social 
characteristics of both countries are very different. Due to its characteristics, the collective consumption 
model used by Cherchye et al. (2012) is able to  analyze important themes for the formulation of public 
policies and income transfer for the elderly in Brazil, such as the calculation of life insurance and death 
pensions. One possible result of this work, for example, is to show how much a widow(er) should receive 
to  be  as  well  (materially)  as  she(he)  was  when  married.  Thus,  this  application  becomes  relevant  in  the 
Brazilian context, since the vast majority of the elderly survive from income transfer programs, such as 
death  pensions  and  retirement,  for  example.  In  addition,  the  above  model  will  provide  poverty  rates 
different  from  those  used  by  traditional  analysis,  allowing  a  comparison  with  those  used  by  the  World 
Bank. Such an approach highlights the importance of the theme for both the public sphere and economic 
agents.  We  must  emphasize  that  the  present  work  is  the  first  to  analyze  poverty  among  elderly  using  a 
collective  consumption  model  in  a  developing  country,  and  uses  a  different  and  more  representative 
basket of consumption than that used in Cherchye et al. (2012). 
 
Our  results  show  considerable  economies  of  scale  and  a  husband’s  share  that  is  rising  in  total 
expenditures.  OECD  scale  underestimates  poverty  among  elderly  women  in  couples  and  overestimates 
poverty  among  elderly  men  in  couples.    In  the  case  of  widow  and  widowers,  in  most  of  the  periods, 
OECD scale underestimates poverty rates. Finally, we find that the drop in material well-being following 
the wife’s death is rather substantial for men and the opposite was observed for women in Brazil. 
 

2.  Theoretical Framework 

 

The  collective  consumption  model  recognizes  that  each  member  has  his  individual  preferences 
and  the  result  of  the  allocation  decision  is  made  by  the  individuals  who  compose  the  household. 
Following many authors4, the unitary consumer model of household will initially be presented. It will be 
used  in  the  case  of  single  person  households.  Next,  the  collective  consumption  model  and  analytical 
concepts of well-being that emerge from this model will be presented.

2.1.Unitary consumption model 

 
Following  Cherchye  et  al.  (2012)  and  Browning  et  al.  (2013),  we  will  use  the  unitary  model  of 
consumption  for  a  household  with  only  one  individual  𝑘,  where  𝑘 = 𝑚  if  the  household  consists  of  an 
elderly man, while 𝑘 = 𝑤 if the individual is an elderly woman. We assume that a total expenditure 𝑥𝑘 is 
spent for a given household over a period of time with 𝑛 goods. These can be purchased in non-negative 
quantities (𝑞𝑖

𝑘) with fixed prices (𝑝𝑖). The budget constraint can be written as follows: 

 

𝑥𝑘 = 𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖
 

𝑘,  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

        

 

(1) 

By  using  the  equal  sign  we  assumed  that  the  consumers  in  the  household  will  always  reach  the 
upper  limit  of  its  range  of  possibilities,  implying  no  satiation.  In  addition,  the  above  equation  assumes 
that the expenditure 𝑥𝑘 is determined separately from the decision to purchase. 

 

𝑘 𝑈𝑘(𝑞𝑖

𝑘 = 𝑥𝑘,  

𝑘) subject a 𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖

The unitary consumption model can be constructed by optimizing the utility  function, subject  to 
the  budget  constraint  (Deaton  and  Muellbauer,  1980a).  Preferences  are  represented  by  a  two-times 
𝑘). Therefore, 
differentiable direct utility function, strictly increasing and strictly quasi-concave as 𝑈𝑘(𝑞𝑖
the individual 𝑘 faces the following problem: 
 
max𝑞𝑖
 
where  𝑈𝑘(𝑞𝑖

𝑘 = 𝑔𝑖
𝑞𝑖
 

𝑘)  is  the  utility  function;  𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖
𝑘, the amount consumed of good 𝑖; e 𝑥𝑘, the total expenditure. 

The  solution  of  the  first  order  condition  will  result  in  the  Marshallian  or  non-compensated 

𝑘 = 𝑥𝑘,  the  budget  constraint;  𝑝𝑖,  the  price  of  good  𝑖,  ∀ i =

𝑘(𝑝𝑖 𝑥𝑘⁄ ),

2.2.Collective consumption model 

 

Unlike  the  traditional  unitary  consumption  model  that  describes  the  behavior  of  households,  the 
collective consumption model explicitly recognizes that a household is composed of several members do 
not  necessarily  behave  as  a  single  decision  maker.  In  other  words,  the  collective  consumption  model 
recognizes  that  each  member  has  his  individual  preferences  and  the  result  of  the  allocation  decision 
within the household is Pareto efficient. Thus, considering a household consisting of two elderly (𝑚 e 𝑤)5 
where  both  individuals  do  not  participate  in  the  labor  market,  it  is  possible  to  write  Pareto  efficiency 
decisions of the couple as a constrained maximization of a weighted sum (Cherchye et al., 2012): 

 

 

 

 

 

 

𝑚),  

𝑤) + 𝑈𝑚(𝑞𝑖

𝑈̃ = 𝜇(𝑝′/𝑥, 𝑠)𝑈𝑤(𝑞𝑖
 
𝑚) are the elderly individual utility 
where 𝜇(𝑝′/𝑥, 𝑠) is the Pareto efficient weight; and 𝑈𝑤(𝑞𝑖
functions, twice continuously differentiable, strictly increasing and strictly quasi-concave. This equation 
can  be  interpreted  as  the  welfare  function  of  the  household,  although  the  relative  effect  of  individual 
utility  function  of  household  members  may  vary  according  to  price  and  distribution  factors  (𝑠). 
Alternatively,  equation  (4)  may  result  from  a  bargaining  model  (Nash's  model of bargaining,  for 
example), in which distribution factors affect individual decisions. Efficient Pareto weight μ is defined as 
the  spouse  bargaining  power  and  can  generally  depend  on  the  prices,  total  expenditure  and  distribution 
factors  vector  𝑠,  defined  as  variables  without  direct  impact  on  preferences,  consumer  technology  or 

𝑤) and 𝑈ℎ(𝑞𝑖

        

(4) 

 

                                                           
5  For  simplicity,  we  will  use  the  words  "married"  and  "spouse",  but  individuals  who  make  up  the  household  does  not 
necessarily need to be married. In addition, we will not consider households composed by other people beside the elderly due 
to the need to identify the individual demands in the collective consumption model.

budget constraint, but that can influence the decision-making process by affecting the bargaining power in 
the household. The model assumes that households do not suffer from money illusion. Possible examples 
of distribution factors include individual salary (Browning et al., 1994), or income outside work (Thomas, 
1990),  or  individual  benefits  provided  by  relatives  such  as  inheritance  (Rubalcava  and  Tomas,  2000). 
Therefore,  if  𝜇(𝑝′ 𝑥, 𝑠⁄
)  increases  due  to  a  distribution  factor  𝑠,  then  the  wife's  bargaining  position 
improves following this increase in 𝑠. This implies that the wife is able to request greater share of utility 
than before by an intra-household allocation that is more favorable to her. 

According  to  Browning  et  al.  (2013),  the  economies  of  scale  of  living  as  a  couple  should  be 
considered  in  a  collective  consumption  model.  Consequently,  the  aggregate  consumption  of  the  elderly 
couple 𝑞 = 𝑞𝑤 + 𝑞𝑚 will not necessarily be equal to the basket of goods 𝑧 purchased by the household. 
In this context,  according to  Vermeulen  (2002),  some goods  are purely private and other purely public, 
with the added generality that some goods may be public and private. Following Cherchye et al. (2012), 
examples  of  goods  that  may  have  a  public  nature  are  rent  or  heating:  consumption  of  it  by  one  of  the 
spouses does not  reduce the supply available  for the other spouse,  while  no individual can be  excluded 
from consuming it. On the other hand, goods like beverages are purely private: every bottle of coke drunk 
by  one  of  the  members  cannot  be  drunk  by  the  other  one.  However,  in  reality,  the  distinction  is  not 
necessarily  that  easy.  For  example,  a  car  driven  alone  or  in  couple  could  be  modeled  as  two  separate 
𝑚) or  purely  public  (𝑞 = 𝑥𝑗 2⁄   with  an  additional  restriction  that 
goods,  purely  private  (𝑞 = 𝑞𝑗
𝑤 = 𝑥𝑗
𝑥𝑗

𝑚). As the examples show, many goods will have both a private and a public component6. 
Following  Browning  et  al.  (2013),  we  assume  that  a  couple  is  characterized  by  a  consumption 
technology  that  transforms  the  household’s  purchased  quantity  vector  z  into  two  individual  vectors  of 
𝑚.  Often  the  linear  consumption  technology  used  is  mathematically 
private  good  equivalents  𝑞𝑖
identical  to  Gorman’s  linear  techniques7  (1976),  except  that  we  apply  in  the  context  of  a  collective 
consumption model. For simplicity, the consumer technology will be restricted to a simple Barten-type: 

𝑤  and  𝑞𝑖

𝑤 + 𝑞𝑗

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(5) 

        

𝑧 = 𝐴𝑞,  
 
where  the  technology  matrix  A  is  a  diagonal  n  by  n  matrix,  with  entries  that  are  between  0.5  and  1. 
Diagonal  elements  associated  with  purely  private  goods  are  equal  to  1,  while  entries  associated  with 
𝑤 =
purely  public  goods  are  equal  to  0.5.  Remark,  however,  that  purely  public  goods  also  imply  that  𝑞𝑗
𝑚,  which  is  not  imposed  here.  Goods  that  have  both  a  public  and  a  private  component  are  associated 
𝑞𝑗
with an entry that is between 0.5 and 1. As discussed by Browning et al. (2013), the above consumption 
technology is  similar to  Becker’s (1965) household  production model. The crucial difference is  that the 
goods purchased at the market serve as inputs to produce a greater quantity of the same goods via sharing, 
and thus are not inputs to produce household goods as in a Beckerian model.  
Taking  into  account  that  the  couple  faces  a  budget  constraint  𝑥 = 𝑝′𝑧,  the  elderly  couple's 
 
consumption  behavior  is  different  from  the  elderly  behavior  in  a  one-person  household  (the  unitary 
consumption  model  is  distinct  from  the  collective  consumption  model).  Given  all  this,  the  couple's 
optimization  program  can  be  formulated.  This  program  boils  down  to  the  assumption  that  the  spouses 
maximize the weighted sum of utilities subject to the consumption technology and the household's budget 
constraint:

The  optimization  program  results  in  a  set  of  n  household  demand  functions  and  two  sets  of  n 

private good equivalent demand functions: 

                                                           
6 See Browning and Chiappori (1998) and Cherchye et al. (2007) for collective consumption models that explicitly account for 
different uses (private, public or both) of the purchased consumption bundle. 
7 The Gorman’s linear technology demand model of consumption (1976) can be specified as follows:  𝐹(𝑧) = 𝐴ℎ𝐵 (

𝐴′𝑝

𝑥−𝑎′𝑝

𝑎. Barten (1964) is the Gorman’s model (1976) with 𝑎  =  0 and 𝐴 as a diagonal matrix.

Browning  et  al.  (2013)  also  derived  a  dual  representation  of  the  household’s  optimization 
program.  This  dual  representation  summarizes  into  a  two-stage  budgeting  process:  in  a  first  stage, 
household  members  divide  the  household’s  aggregate  resources  among  each  other.  In  the  second  stage, 
each individual maximizes her/his own utility function subject to the resulting shares and taking account 
the  personalized  prices.  Following  Cherchye  et  al.  (2012),  in  a  collective  model  with  only  private 
consumption,  these  personalized  prices  are  equal  to  observed  market  prices.  In  a  context  with  public 
consumption,  personalized  prices  are  a  vector  of  Lindahl  prices;  at  these  prices  and  the  individual’s 
fraction  of  the  household’s  aggregate  resources,  each  individual  is  willing  to  consume  her/his  vector  of 
private good equivalents. Hence, the Lindahl type vector of personalized prices are:

Given  these  personalized  prices  and  a  sharing  rule  𝜂(𝑝/𝑥, 𝑠),  constrained  between  0  and  1,  we 

have: 
 
𝑤 = ℎ𝑖

The Lindahl type vector of personalized prices are normalized such that the household’s aggregate 
resources are equal to 𝜋′(𝑞𝑤 + 𝑞𝑚) = 1, whereas the shares η e (1 – η)  of the household’s resources that 
are  allocated  to  the  wife  and  husband  are  respectively  equal  to  𝜋′𝑞𝑤  and  𝜋′𝑞𝑚.  Similar  to  the  Pareto 
weight μ, the sharing rule η is a measure of the wife’s weight in the household’s decision making process. 
Ceteris paribus, the higher the share η, the higher the utility that will be attained by the wife by means of 
a higher private consumption 𝑞𝑤8.  

 

2.2.1.  Analytical concepts of well-being 

 

Once  the  above  collective  consumption  model  is  identified,  three  useful  welfare-analytical 
concepts  can  be  derived.  They  are  potential  analytical  tools  of  the  collective  consumption  model,  in 
addition to the traditional tools of demand models, such as price and income elasticities.  

 

2.2.1.1.Bargaining power among the elderly 

 

One of this paper’s objectives is the analysis of the resource allocation among the elderly and the 
possible bargaining power within the household. The tool offered by the collective consumption model to 
make this analysis is the sharing rule 𝜂(𝑝/𝑥, 𝑠), a direct measurement of the intra-household bargaining

shadow prices, given the observed household demand function, see Browning et al. (2013).

power.  If  all  goods  are  considered  private,  without  economies  of  scale  or  scope  in  consumption  (if 
𝑞𝑤 + 𝑞𝑚 = 𝑧), then 𝜂 would be exactly equal to that part of x that was used to buy the basket consumed 
by the husband 𝑞ℎ. Browning and Chiappori (1998), using only household data, showed that this measure 
of bargaining power can only be identified in very specific situations. In contrast, according to Browning 
et al. (2013), as described above, by  combining the household  demand  function and individual demand 
function of the elderly, 𝜂 sharing rule is completely identified. 
 

 

2.2.1.2.Economy of scale in consumption 

 

Another  important  analytical  concept  of  well-being  that  emerges  after  the  identification  of  the 
collective consumption model is measure of the economies of scale in consumption within the household. 
Following Browning et al. (2013), a global measure of economies of scale from living together within the 
household can be defined as: 
 

𝑝′(𝑔𝑖

𝑤(

𝜋(𝑝/𝑥)
𝜂(𝑝/𝑥,𝑠)

) +𝑔𝑖

𝑚(

𝜋(𝑝/𝑥)

1−𝜂(𝑝/𝑥,𝑠)

))

𝑚, 𝑥 is what the 
where given the estimated vector of private good equivalents of the model 𝑞𝑖 = 𝑞𝑖
𝑚) is the cost of purchasing the private good equivalents 𝑧. 
household spends to acquire 𝑧 and 𝑝′(𝑞𝑖
In  other  words,  the  above  equation  compares  the  expenditure  required  to  finance  the  aggregate  private 
consumption if both individuals lived alone rather than forming a couple, given the expenditure required 
for the consumption bundle 𝑧. It is clear that the more sharing inside the household, the higher economies 
of scale will also be. 

𝑤 + 𝑞𝑖

𝑤 + 𝑞𝑖

(14) 

      

 

 

 

Following Cherchye et al (2012), two extreme cases can be distinguished. First, the case when the 
aggregate private consumption 𝑞 would be the same to the observed couple’s consumption bundle 𝑧. In 
this case, the consumption would be purely private and the measure for the economies of scale  𝑒 would 
be equal to zero, reaching its minimum.  Second, the case when the aggregate private consumption would 
be  the  same  of  two  times  the  couple’s  consumption  bundle  𝑧.  In  this  case,  the  consumption  would  be 
purely public and the measure for the economies of scale 𝑒 would be equal to 1, reaching its maximum.  
 

2.2.1.3.Indifference scales 

 

It should be stressed that the measure for the economies of scale assumes that there is no shift in 
the  individual  consumption  pattern  when  both  spouses  would  live  alone  rather  than  in  a  couple.  If 
individuals live alone, they are confronted with market prices instead of the individual shadow prices. If 
both  sets  of  prices  do  not  coincide  (as  expected),  the  optimal  consumption  pattern  can  be  different. 
Following the application of the collective consumption model of Cherchye et al (2012), the indifference 
scale  for  the  wife  and  husband  in  a  household  composed  only  by  an  elderly  couple  are  respectively 
defined by:   
 

min𝑞𝑤∗(𝑝′𝑞𝑤∗|𝑈𝑤(𝑞𝑤∗)=𝑈𝑤(𝑞𝑤))

𝑥

,   

min𝑞𝑚∗(𝑝′𝑞𝑚∗|𝑈ℎ(𝑞𝑚∗)=𝑈ℎ(𝑞𝑚))

𝑆𝑤 =
 

𝑆𝑚 =
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

     

     

 

 

 (15) 

 (16) 

The  numerators  of  the  equations  above  represents  the  minimum  expenditure  required  for  an 
elderly living alone to achieve the same indifference curve as living as a couple, and get the same vector 
of  private  good  equivalents  𝑞𝑤  e  𝑞𝑚,  respectively.  The  denominator  is  equal  to  the  couple’s  total 
expenditure  𝑥  which  is  used  to  support  household  consumption  𝑧.  Thus,  according  Browning  et  al. 
(2013), the definition of 𝑆𝑖(𝑝/𝑥, 𝜂) depends only on the household resources and the degree of which the 

 

7 

consumption  is  shared  within  the  household.  So  the  indifference  of  scale  can  be  identified  without  any 
cardinalization of utility function or assumptions related to interpersonal comparability.  
 

3.  Empirical Application 

 

The  demand  of  the  single-person  elderly  households  will  be  estimated  by  the  traditional  unitary 
consumption  model.  At  the  same  time,  assuming  equality  of  preferences,  we  will  estimate  individual 
preferences of the couple via collective consumption model, where the other components of the structural 
model  (specifically  the  sharing  rule  and  the  Barten  scale)  are  identified.  Finally,  we  present  the 
information about the database and the construction of the price index.  
 

3.1.1.  Individual’s demand system 

 

We used Deaton and Muellbauer (1980b) Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS). The AIDS model 
brings  together  almost  all  the  properties  theoretically  and  empirically  desirable:  it  is  an  arbitrary  first 
order  approximation  for  any  demand  system;  satisfies  the  axioms  of  choice;  perfectly  integrates 
consumers while still allowing non-linear Engel curves; and the properties of homogeneity and symmetry 
can  be  tested  and  imposed  by  simple  constraints  on  the  parameters.    Therefore,  the  individual  indirect 
utility function is assumed to be of the following form (𝑘 = 𝑤, 𝑚):

The  parameters  of  the  AIDS  demand  systems  were  estimated  by  the  programming  routine  for 
STATA described in Poi (2008). Due to limited degrees of freedom and thus to improve the efficiency of 
our estimates the demand restrictions are imposed. The adding up constraint was imposed by treating one 
of the goods as "residual" and the demand systems were estimated for 𝑛 − 1 goods, and the homogeneity 
and  symmetry  constraints  were  imposed  on  the  demand  systems  by  parameter  restrictions  (Yen  et  al., 
2003).  Using  the  adding  up  restriction,  it  is  possible  to  retrieve  the  parameters  and  calculate  the 
elasticities  for  that  good.  The  demand  equations  were  estimated  by  a  seemingly  unrelated  nonlinear 
regression  system  (SUR),  according  to  STATA's  NLSUR  command.  The  method  used  was  IFGNLS 
(Iterated  feasible  generalized  non-linear  least  squares),  with  results  similar  to  the  Maximum  Likelihood

estimates.  Thus,  in  order  to  make  statistical  inference  about  the  values  of  the  elasticities,  the  so-called 
"delta  method"9  is  applied,  which  allows  to  transform  the  variance-covariance  matrix  of  the  estimated 
parameters into the variance-covariance matrix of the parameters of interest (Durham and Eales, 2010).  

Finally,  as  in  Cherchye  et  al.  (2012),  we  can’t  identify  if  the  elderly  is  a  widow(er)  or  just  an 
𝑘  will be the same across both types 
individual living alone. Therefore, the parameters 𝛼𝑖
of female and male individuals, but  real expenditures and prices appearing in the demand equations will 
differ between widow(er)s and individuals in couples, as we will illustrate next.

3.1.2.  Consumption technology 

 

Now  we  will  turn  attention  to  the  structural  model  components  that  are  only  associated  with 
elderly couples. As we said earlier, we will assume a Barten type linear consumption technology function. 
Consequently, given a basket of consumer goods z observed by the couples and the set of private goods 
equivalents for the two elderly (qw e qm), the consumer technology function is given by:  
 
z = Ai(qw + qm),  
 
where  Ai  is  the  corresponding  diagonal  of  matrix  A  (see  equation  (5)).  In  the  empirical  application,  Ai 
will be restricted between 0.5 and 1 (which are respectively purely public and purely private consumption 
cases), assuming the following functional specification for Ai (i  =  1, . . . , n): 
 

(21) 

      

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Therefore, the demand system for couples will have the shadow prices according to this equation:

3.1.3.  Sharing rule 

 

As we discussed earlier, the sharing rule (𝜂) is a measure of the wife’s weight in the household’s 
decision  making  process,  or  a  direct  measurement  of  intra-household  bargaining  power.  That  is,  the 
higher  the  share  𝜂,  the  higher  the  utility  that  will  be  achieved  by  the  wife  due  to  a  higher  private 
consumption  qw.  In  our  empirical  application,  the  sharing  rule  among  elderly  will  depend  on  the 
following  distribution  factors:  the  real  expenditure  of  couple  (𝑠1);  a  dummy  variable  that  indicates 
whether the female has a strictly higher income than the male (𝑠2); the education level of the female (𝑠3); 
and a dummy variable that indicates if both individuals’ contribute to the household income (𝑠4).  

By the definition, we can see that the sharing rule is restricted between 0 and 1. Therefore, we use 

the following functional specification:  
 

𝜂 =

𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝛿0+𝛿1𝑠1+𝛿2𝑠2+𝛿3𝑠3+𝛿4𝑠4)

1+𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝛿0+𝛿1𝑠1+𝛿2𝑠2+𝛿3𝑠3+𝛿4𝑠4)

,  

 

 

 

 

 

   

     

 

 (24) 

 
where 𝑠𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, 2 3, 4) are the respectively household specific distribution factors and 𝛿𝑖 (𝑖 = 0, 1, 2 3, 4) 
are the parameters to be estimated.

3.1.4.  Couple’s demand system  

 

By  the  definition  of  the  Barten  type  linear  consumption  technology  function  (equation  22),  the 
shadow prices (equation 23) and the sharing rule (equation 24), we can define the equation of the elderly 
couples’  demand  system  in  the  collective  consumption  model.  Thus,  for  the  individual  preferences 
represented by the AIDS model, the budget of the equation’s portion applied to a household 𝑘 with two 
elderly people is as follows:

 (25) 

                                                                                       

This  equation shows that the budget  shares of the couple are equal  to  a  weighted average of the 
elderlies’  budget  shares,  with  weights  given  by  the  income  sharing  rule  𝜂 and  1 − 𝜂.  Therefore,  the 
parameter 𝜂 represents both the percentage of resources controlled by the widow and the extent to which 
the household’s demand liken her demand, evaluated at shadow prices.  

We emphasize that the parameters of the collective consumption model consist of all parameters 
𝑚;  the  Barten  scale,  𝐴𝑖;  and  the 
of  the  AIDS  model  of  both  the  single’s  budget  shares,  𝑤𝑖
parameters  of  the  sharing  rule, 𝜂.  We  will  use  a  two-stage  procedure  to  estimate  the  complete  system, 
where the individual preference parameters are first estimated and then used in equation (25) to estimate 
the  parameters  of  the  Barten  scale  and  the  sharing  rule.  This  strategy  has  the  virtue  of  simplicity  of 
estimation depending on the household arrangement (for example, in a household consisting of a couple, 
it  is  enough  to  estimate  two  traditional  AIDS  systems  and  then  a  joint  system).  Therefore,  both  stages 
were estimated by SUR, according to STATA's NLSUR command (nonlinear system of equations). The 
method used was IFGNLS - iterative feasible generalized nonlinear least squares.

3.2. Brazilian Household Budget Survey – POF 

 

We  used  the  microdata  of  the  Brazilian  Household  Budget  Survey  -  Pesquisa  de  Orçamentos 
Familiares (POF) conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - Instituto Brasileiro de 
Geografia  e  Estatística  (IBGE,  v)  in  1995/96,  2002/03  and  2008/09,  which  collected  households’ 
expenditure on consumption goods/services from 11 metropolitan areas, in the case of POF 1995/96, and 
all Brazilian territory, in the case of the last two researches, POF 2002/03 and POF 2008/09. The POFs 
are a cross sectional national surveys which gathers information on household expenditures, incomes and 
sociodemographic information.  

Since the sample of POF 1995/96 was restricted to Brazilian main cities, we restricted our sample 
accordingly,  gathering  data  from  11  metropolitan  areas:  1.  Rio  de  Janeiro;  2.  Porto  Alegre;  3.  Belo 
Horizonte; 4. Recife;  5. São Paulo; 6.  Municipality of  Brasília-DF;  7. Belém;  8. Fortaleza;  9. Salvador; 
10.  Curitiba;  and  11.  Municipality  of  Goiânia10.  For  simplicity,  we  will  call  all  of  them  metropolitan 
areas.  We  also  select  our  sample  with  only  single  elderly  men  and  women  who  are  aged  60+  and  for 
couples with no one else in the household and where each individual is aged 60+. This results in a sample 
that consists of 772 widows, 292 widowers and 680 couples. 

                                                           
10 According to POF 2008/09 data, there  were 12,905,981 households headed by elderly people in Brazil,  where 10,744,628 
belonged  to  urban  areas  (83.3%  of  all  households),  4,539,422  to  metropolitan  areas  (35.2%  of  all  households  and  42.3%  of 
urban  households)  and  4,033,494  to  the  eleven  metropolitan  regions  analyzed  (31.3%  of  all  households,  37.6%  of  urban 
households  and  88.9%  of  metropolitan  households).  In  addition,  there  were  41,620,280  adult-headed  households  in  Brazil, 
where  35,236,113  belonged  to  urban  areas  (84.6%  of  all  households),  15,547,667  to  metropolitan  regions  (37.4%  of  all 
households  and  44.1%  of  urban  households)  and  13,364,201  to  the  respective  metropolitan  areas  (32.1%  of  all  households, 
37.9% of urban households and 86% of metropolitan households). These information shows that the eleven metropolitan areas 
covered in the study are relevant in relation to the total households, to those located in urban areas and to those located in the 
metropolitan regions as a whole in Brazil.

demographic  variables  are  allowed  to  affect  both  the  preferences  of  each  single’s  budget  shares. 
Following  Asano  and  Fiúza  (2001),  price  indexes  were  constructed  for  the  six  categories.  The  price 
indexes allow for comparisons both across-time and across-region.

According to equations (20) and (25), since the demand systems will be composed of 5 goods and

parameters regarding the distribution factors of the sharing rule (𝛿𝑖 = 5) and 1 parameter referring to the 
sharing rule itself (𝜂 = 1), resulting in a total of 118 parameters of the AIDS model to analyze the well-
being of the elderly.

4.1. Descriptive statistics 

 

 

First,  we  discuss  the  main  descriptive  statistics  from  our  database.  Table  2  provides  summary 
statistics from our sample by household type. We can see that the average age is practically the same in 
the different households, around 70 years, and the average age of elderly couple households is the highest, 
71.1 years. The average education level is higher for elderly couple household type, 6.10 years, in view of 
4.87 and 5.88  years in  widower  and widow household  type, respectively. The level  of education  is  still 
relatively low for these household types, since an individual with 6 years of schooling did not complete 
Elementary School12.

enrollment is compulsory for all people between the ages of 6 and 14.

Another important statistic is related to Government transfers. Most of the elderly household types 
receive  some  kind  of  government  benefit.  We  can  highlight  the  elderly  women  households  and  elderly 
couple  households  that  almost  84%  and  85%  of  them  respectively  receive  some  kind  of  government 
transfer. This information can be justified by the increase in the Federal Social Programs at the beginning 
of  the  21st  century  in  Brazil,  mainly  the  benefit  called  Benefício  de  Prestação  Continuada  (BPC),  a 
government social assistance benefit that aims to provide a minimum wage for all elderly of 65 years or 
older and disabled people who are not entitled to social security, cannot work or lead an independent life 
and receive up to ¼ of the minimum wage as per capita family income (Brasil, 2006).   

In relation to the monthly income, we can see that households composed only by elderly men have 
on  average  higher  income  than  households  composed  only  by  elderly  women,  US$1,031.91  and 
US$643.15  respectively,  that  is,  there  is  still  an  income  inequality  between  genders  in  Brazil.  This 
inequality in the distribution of income has a direct influence on the consumption of goods and services, 
since elderly with higher income have greater purchasing power, which may influence their life quality. 
As expected, income in couple’s elderly households was higher than individual’s elderly households.  

Data  reveals  that  the  expenditure  on  Housing  is  the  main  item  on  the  elderly  household 
representing about 43.3% and 38.2% of the budget shares in elderly women and elderly couple household 
types, respectively. All the budget shares are similar in the elderly household types, with the exception of 
Transportation - where the share is lower in elderly women households (4.6%) compared to elderly men 
(8.9%) and elderly couples households (9.9%) - and Health care - in which the share is lower in elderly 
men households (10.6%) compared to elderly women (17.6%) and elderly couples households (16.3%).

4.2. Couple’s demand results 

 

We  focus  our  attention  on  the  estimation  results  with  respect  to  the  parameters  in  the  elderly 
couple model: the sharing rule, distribution factors and consumption technology parameters13. The main 
results for our elderly couple model are displayed in Table 3.

The  first  part  of  Table  3  shows  the  estimated  parameters  for  distribution  factors  (𝒔𝒊).  Ceteris 
paribus,  higher  real  expenditures  imply  a  higher  share  for  females.  This  result  is  in  line  with  earlier 
findings  in  the  literature  (see  Cherchye  et  al.  (2012)  and  Browning  et  al.  (2013)).  If  elderly  women  in 
couple have more income than elderly men, this will also contribute to a higher share for females. This 
result  may  indicate  a  greater  bargaining  power  in  households  where  the  elderly  woman  has  a  higher 
income than the elderly man, benefiting more the private consumption of the elderly woman. On the other 
hand,  all  else  equal,  the  share  that  is  shifted  to  the  woman  is  slightly  lower  when  she  has  a  higher 
education level than her husband and if both elderly contribute to the household income. The first result 
was found in Cherchye et al. (2012) too, and the second one can indicate that husbands tend to control the 
income inside household. To confirm this, we show the results of the sharing rule (𝜂). The average share 
was close to 0.43 with a minimum of 0.27 and a maximum of 0.58. This implies that the average couple’s 
consumption pattern is  more in  line  with  that of husbands, but  there is  quite some heterogeneity  across 
couples.  The  sharing  rule  estimated  in  Cherchye  et  al.  (2012)  for  Netherland  elderly  couples  was  0.63 
with  a  minimum  of  0.54  and  a  maximum  of  0.73,  which  implies  that,  unlike  in  Brazilian  elderly

households,  the  couple’s  consumption  pattern  in  Netherlands  elderly  households  are  more  in  line  with 
that  of  wives.  Browning  et  al.  (2013)  on  Canadian  data  of  prime  age  employed  individuals  obtained  a 
share  of  0.63  at  the  mean  of  their  data  (with  minimum  and  maximum  shares  of  respectively  0.47  and 
0.75). However, our estimation results are very similar to the shares calculated by Gómes (2017), which 
used  a  micro-level  dataset  from  POF  2008/2009  of  Brazilian  traditional  families  (married  couples  with 
zero to three children). He found a higher resource share for men in all household compositions14.  

 

The estimation results with respect to the consumption technology are presented in the second and 
third part of Table 3. The second part of the table shows the consumption technology parameters 𝑎𝑖, while 
the third part shows the implied entries of the diagonal technology matrix 𝐴𝑖. It turns out that Housing and 
Other expenses are close to being purely private goods, while Health care are close to be a public good. 
Food  is  somewhere  in  between  and,  Transportation  and  Clothing  although  presented  missing  standard 
errors15,  were  considered  purely  public  and  purely  private  goods,  respectively.  With  the  exception  of 
Housing, our results were very intuitive and agrees with those found in Cherchye et al. (2012).  
 
Another useful tool to interpret the couples’  demand results is the measure for the economies of 
scale of living in a couple (see equation 11).  We calculate this measure at de mean point in the sample 
and the result was 0.33, with a minimum value of 0.27 and a maximum value of 0.40. The interpretation 
of this value is simple: a scale close to zero would refer to a case where most of the consumption is purely 
private,  while  a  scale  close  to  one  would  be  associated  with  a  case  where  most  of  the  consumption  is 
purely public. So our model suggest that a large part of elderly couples’ consumption has a private nature. 
This result was close to the one found in Cherchye et al. (2012), which found a measure equal to 0.38.  
 

4.3. Poverty among the elderly in Brazil 

 

In this section, we will follow the application of Cherchye el al. (2012) to analyze poverty among 
elderly  people  in  Brazil  using  the  methodology  of  the  collective  consumption  model.  The  idea  of  this 
section  is  to  illustrate  the  impact  of  choosing  a  different  methodology  to  calculate  poverty  indexes, 
comparing  our  results  with  those  obtained  by  the  traditional  analysis  based  on  the  OECD  modified 
equivalence scale. Therefore, the difference between our approach and the OECD will be the fact that the 
collective  consumption  model  allows  for  household  members  that  have  different  preferences,  unequal 
sharing of resources in couples and the economies of scale of living in a couple.  
 

4.3.1.  OECD versus collective poverty analysis 

 

In  Table  4  we  present  the  results  for  the  evolution  of  poverty  rates  for  individuals,  elderly  in 
couples  and  elderly  in  total  and  poverty  values  in  Brazil  using  the  OECD  modified  and  collective 
consumption  approach.    The  OECD  poverty  is  calculated  in  three  steps:  first,  equivalent  expenditures 
were  calculated  by  dividing  household  expenditures  by  the  modified  OECD  equivalence  scale  - 
household  expenditures  are  either  divided  by  1  (single  individuals)  or  by  1.5  (couples)16;  second,  the 
resulting  equivalent  expenditures  of  elderly  women,  elderly  men  and  individuals  in  elderly  couples  are 
used  to  obtain  the  median  of  the  equivalent  expenditures  for  the  three  periods;  and  third,  the  elderly  is 
considered to be poor if  the equivalent expenditures are lower than 60 percent of the time period specific 

                                                           
14 Velilla-Gómez (2017) found a mean value for men resources shares of 0.53 in childless couple’s households, 0.41 in couples 
with one child, 0.38 in couples with two children and 0.36 in couples with three children. On the other hand, the author found 
woman resources shares of 0.47 in childless couple’s households, 0.406 in couples with one child, 0.35 in couples with two 
children and 0.34 in couples with three children.  
15 Missing standard errors are usually produced by nearly singular variance covariance matrices.  This is usually associated to 
database  and/or  model  specification  issues.  We  tried  to  test  several  model  specifications  with  several  estimation  procedures, 
but the results continued to present missing standard errors for these parameters. Therefore, we conclude that this result is due 
to limitations of the database. 
16 It is important to  notice that  modified OECD scale  follow  economies of scale  measure of 0.33, the same  of our estimated 
collective model.

median  equivalent  expenditures  (CHERCHYE  et  al.,  2012).  The  collective  consumption  poverty  is 
different  from  the  OECD  poverty  rate:  first,  we  must  calculate  the  expenditures  on  private  good 
equivalent consumption that may differ across spouses and, as discussed earlier, depend on the economies 
of scale associated with living in a couple and on the sharing rule; second and third steps are the same as 
in  OECD  poverty  rate,  but  using  the  private  good  equivalent  consumption  for  individual  elderly  in 
couples.

Table 4 demonstrates that the poverty rates for the different elderly groups in Brazil are relatively 
high between 1995 and 2009. However, the rates in both approaches were declining for all elderly groups 
if  we  compare  the  first  and  the  last  period  of  analysis.    In  general,  if  we  compare  our  results  to  those 
found  in  Cherchye  et  al.  (2012)  for  elderly  in  Netherlands,  our  poverty  rates  are  more  than  ten  times 
higher,  except  for  Elderly  men  in  couples.  This  result  is  quite  worrying,  because  if  you  look  for  the 
Elderly in total group in our last period, despite in better situation than the elderly in 1995/96, almost 25% 
of them are still below the poverty line.  Our results agree in part with those found in Turra et al. (2008), 
Coetlar  and  Tornarolli  (2009)  and  Turra  and  Rocha  (2010).  These  authors  state  that  income  transfer 
programs  (especially  the  Bolsa  Família  Program)  and  the  expansions  of  the  non-contributory  social 
security system  explain much of the reduction of poverty and inequality  in  Brazil during the last  years, 
and we can confirm this poverty reduction using the collective consumption methodology. However, the 
magnitude of this reduction is much greater in those papers than in our results. For example, Coetlar and 
Tornarolli (2009) state that the poverty rate among the elderly in Brazil in 2008 fell from 49.3% to 4.2% 
after  taking  into  account  income  transfers.  Turra  and  Rocha  (2010)  confirm  that,  considering  public 
transfers, less than 5% of elderly in Brazil can be considered poor using the World Bank's poverty line17.  

                                                           
17 Turra and Rocha (2010) estimated poverty rates based on the World Bank's poverty line of US$ 2.00 per day in purchasing 
power parity in 2005 with and without public transfers including contributory and non-contributory retirement benefits, as well 
as conditional cash transfers from the Bolsa Família program.

If we look for the different groups, poverty was higher in the Elderly women (42.4% and 40.9%) 
and men (41.3% and 39.4%) groups respectively in both approaches in the first period of analysis. In the 
last period, the poverty rates were similar on the groups, but  Elderly men (27.2% for both) and women 
(26.2% and 26.6%) were still poorer. However, in the last period, the highest poverty rate was in Elderly 
women  in  couples  using  the  collective  approach  (29.9%),  as  well  of  for  the  period  of  POF  2002/03 
(40.8%). This result can be explained by the fact that an important part of the household’s budget is spent 
on  public  consumption  and  that  the  sharing  rule  for  our  collective  model  is  more  favorable  to  men. 
Therefore, elderly men in couples are able to attract a relatively higher share of private good equivalents, 
with the obvious consequence that they are less likely to be labelled as poor (and vice versa for women) 
when households have increasing financial means, as is the case in our data. These results show that much 
of  the  poverty  among  the  elderly  in  Brazil  comes  from  the  issue  of  inequality  in  the  intra-household 
distribution of resources. Therefore, disregarding this question means greatly underestimating the poverty 
of the elderly. Lise and Seitz (2011) already showed that traditional measures of consumption inequality 
only  reﬂect  inequality  at  the  household  level,  when  it  is  assumed  that  there  is  no  intra-household 
inequality.  

We  conclude  from  our  above  results  that,  as  well  as  in  Cherchye  et  al.  (2012),  although  OECD 
and collective poverty rates are of the same magnitude on average, the OECD approach underestimates 
most of the poverty rates (6 of 12, and the results of 2 of 12 were the same) in the periods and population 
groups in the analysis, mainly in the case for Elderly women in couples. This difference happens because 
the  OECD  poverty  measure  does  not  take  into  account  intra-household  allocation  of  resources,  unequal 
sharing of resources in couples and the economies of scale of living in a couple. 
 

4.3.2.  Economic consequences of being alone (widow(er)hood) 

 

This  subsection  reveals  another  important  policy  issue  that  can  emerge  in  the  collective 
consumption model: the economic consequences of being alone, either by having become a widow(er) or 
divorcee18.  As emphasized in Cherchye et al. (2012), we must make two considerations about the results 
presented here: first, we only look at the impact on the expenditures on private good equivalents (material 
goods)  of  being  alone  and  don’t  concern  about  the  emotional  impact  of  this  event  on  the  indifference 
curves; and second, the results we show are based on a time series of cross-sections, so we are not able to 
analyses the impact of being alone on an individual specific basis. Results are presented in Table 5 and 6.  
Table  5  shows,  for  individuals  in  elderly  couples,  the  average  minimum  expenditures  needed 
when living alone to reach the same indifference curve as when living in a couple (see the numerator of 
equations 12 and 13). These expenditures are calculated for the four different quartiles of the distribution 
of total household expenditures from the couple’s households. This table also shows, for elderly women 
and  men  living  alone,  the  observed  household  expenditures.  Table  8  further  shows  the  corresponding 
average  indifference  scales  for  elderly  women  and  men  in  couples  (see  equations  15  and  16).  By 
definition, the indifference scale for elderly living alone equals 1.  

If  we  look  for  the  results  on  Table  5,  it  is  possible  to  compare  the  individual  household 
expenditure (Elderly men and women) with the minimum expenditures needed when living alone to reach 
the same indifference curve as when living in a couple (Elderly women or men in couples), to conclude 
about  the material  impact  of an individual being  alone (or become  widow(er) or divorced).  For a  given 
expenditure  quartile  and  POF  period,  the  material  impact  to  become  a  widow(er)  corresponds  to  the 
difference  between  the  actually  observed  expenditures  for  elderly  men  or  women  and  the  minimally 
required expenditures of individuals in couples to be materially equally well off when living as a single 
(in case a widow(er) or divorced). So the results on Table 5 suggests that men in all expenditures quartiles 
are  materially  better  off  when  living  in  couple  than  when  living  alone  in  each  period  of  POF  database. 
The reverse pattern was observe for women: on average, with the exception of the POF 1995/96  period 
                                                           
18  We  have  to  be  cautious  here,  because  in  our  database  the  elderly  in  individual  households,  referred  here  as  widows  and 
widowers, are  not observed as  women or  men  who are living  in couples before the death or being divorced of their partner. 
However,  to  interpret  the  results  in  Table  5  and  6,  we  use  the  assumption  that  widow(er)s  are  comparable  to  individuals  in 
couples who are situated in the same expenditure quartile. 

 

16 

and fourth quartile in POF 2008/09 period, women are materially better off when living as a widow than 
when living in a couple. Therefore, these results follow our previous subsection suggesting the prevalence 
of  economies  of  scale  and  a  sharing  rule  more  favorable  to  men.  Cherchye  et  al.  (2012)  found  similar 
results, but the difference was that elderly women in Netherlands are more favored by the intra-household 
bargaining power.

Finally,  we  focus  on  the  average  indifference  scales  by  POF  periods  and  quartiles  presented  on 
Table 6. Results show that the indifference scales depend on total household expenditures given the time 
period.  Therefore,  men  in  couples  that  are  situated  in  the  first  expenditure  quartile  need  77%  of  the 
couple’s expenditure to be equally well off as being alone (widower) as when living in a couple. Women 
in elderly couples in the same quartile need about 56% of the couple’s total expenditures. When we look 
for  the  fourth  expenditure  quartile,  men  need  on  average  83%  of  the  couple’s  resources  to  achieve  the 
same indifference curve  as a widower or divorced man, while women only  would need about  60%. So, 
again these results follow our previous subsection result suggesting the prevalence of economies of scale 
and a sharing rule more favorable to men and, because of this, they need more resources than women to 
be as well of when they become widower or divorced.

5.  CONCLUSIONS 

 

Our  results  for  the  collective  consumption  model  indicate  considerable  economies  of  scale 
associated  with  living  in  a  couple,  and  a  husband’s  share  that  is  rising  in  the  elderly  couple’s  real 
expenditures. We calculated collective consumption model poverty rates and put in contrast to traditional 
poverty rates, which are based on OECD modified equivalent scales for expenditure. Collective poverty 
rates explicitly take into account  the different  intra-household  distribution of resources.  For most of the 
time periods in  our analysis,  collective poverty rates turn out  to  be higher than traditional poverty  rates 
that  are  based  on  the  modified  OECD  equivalence  scale.  These  results  show  that  much  of  the  poverty 
among  the  elderly  in  Brazil  comes  from  the  issue  of  inequality  in  the  intra-household  distribution  of 
resources.  Therefore,  disregarding  this  question  generally  means  underestimating  the  poverty  of  the 
elderly. 
 
Our last conclusion arise in the analysis of the economic (material) impact of become a widow(er) 
or  being  divorced.  Our  results  indicate  a  considerable  drop  in  material  well-being  following  the  wife’s 
death for men.  The opposite conclusion holds for women. After becoming a widow, Brazilian women are 
generally  materially  better  off  than  when  living  in  a  couple  and  these  result  can  be  explained  by  the 
economies of scale of living in a couple, in combination with a sharing rule that is favorable to men.
