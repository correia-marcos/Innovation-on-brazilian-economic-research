Abstract:  Brazil  is  facing  a  demographic  challenge  due  to  important  changes  in  age  structure  of  its 
population. In the last fifty years, the proportion of people aged under 10 dropped from 30% to 17% while 
the proportion of aged over 60 increased from 5% to 10%. Changing in age structure population can affect 
both demand and supply of goods and services. On the demand side, changes in age distribution can alter 
the  composition  of  household  consumption  among  types  of  goods  and  services.  It  occurs  because 
preferences  usually  vary  along  life-cycle.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  estimate  the  association  between 
household  expenditure  composition  and  the  presence  of  children  and  elderly  individuals  in  households. 
This is the first attempt to estimate how household expenditure composition varies among households with 
different age structure in Brazil. A typology of households was built to take into account household age 
structure.  Seven  household  groups  were  defined.  The  association  between  household  age  structure  and 
consumption  composition  was  estimated  through  econometric  models  for  consumption  items  present  in 
Expenditure  Consumption  Survey  (Pesquisa  de  Orçamento  Familiar,  abbreviated  as  POF)  which  were 
aggregated into 15 groups. For each household group and each type of product, a model was run allowing 
the estimation of “household- type semi-elasticity”. Mains results showed that households with elderly or 
children present different patterns of consumption when compared to households composed by only two 
adults. The marginal effects are greater for health-related goods, specifically health insurance and inpatient 
care.

Resumo: O Brasil está enfrentando um desafio demográfico devido a importantes mudanças na estrutura 
etária da população. Nos últimos 50 anos, a proporção de pessoas com idade inferior a 10 caiu de 30% para 
17%, enquanto a proporção de idosos acima de 60 anos aumentou de 5% para 10%. A alteração na estrutura 
etária da população pode afetar tanto a demanda e quanto a oferta de bens e serviços. Do lado da demanda, 
as mudanças na distribuição etária podem alterar a composição do consumo das famílias entre os tipos de 
bens  e  serviços.  Isto  ocorre  porque  as  preferências  normalmente  variam  ao  longo  do  ciclo  de  vida.  O 
objetivo deste trabalho é estimar a associação entre a composição das despesas domiciliares e a presença 
de crianças e idosos nos domicílios. Esta é a primeira tentativa de estimar como composição das despesas 
domiciliares varia entre os domicílios com diferente estrutura etária no Brasil. Uma tipologia domiciliar foi 
construída  considerando  a  estrutura  etária  dos  domicílios.  Foram  definidos  sete  grupos  domiciliares.  A 
associação entre a estrutura etária dos domicílios  e a composição do consumo foi estimada por meio de 
modelos econométricos para os itens de consumo presentes na Pesquisa de Orçamento Familiar – POF que 
foram  agregados  em  15  grupos.  Para  cada  tipologia  domiciliar  e  cada  tipo  de  produto,  um  modelo  foi 
estimado  obtendo  assim  uma  “semi-elasticidade  de  tipologia  domiciliar”.  Os  principais  resultados 
mostraram que os domicílios com idosos ou crianças apresentam diferentes padrões de consumo quando 
comparado com os agregados domiciliares compostos apenas por dois adultos. Os efeitos marginais são 
maiores para produtos relacionados com a saúde, especificamente plano de saúde e serviços de atendimento 
hospitalar.

1.  Introduction 
 

The  demographic  transition  has  occurred  differently  across  countries  depending  on  the  level  of 
economic development. In most developed countries, the demographic transition process has already been 
completed and took two centuries to occur. By contrast, in some developing economies, such as China and 
Brazil, this process has been fast and is still in its second stage, which is characterized by declining fertility 
rates and increasing mortality rates. As other developing economies, Brazil is facing another demographic 
challenge due to important changes in age structure of its population. In the last fifty years, the proportion 
of people aged under 10 dropped from 30 to 17% while the proportion of aged over 60 increased from 5 to 
10%.  According to United Nations projections, in 2050, the proportion of elderly people (aged over 60) 
will represent 29% of the whole population (United Nations, 2011).  

Changing in age structure population can affect both demand and supply of goods and services. On 
the demand side, changes in age distribution can alter the composition of household consumption among 
types of goods and services. It occurs because preferences usually vary along life-cycle. As a consequence, 
if  population  is  aging  very  fast  this  process  might  involve  changes  in  household  consumption.    It  is 
necessary to reorganize the supply of goods and services to face these significant changes in the aggregated 
demand  composition.  In  turn,  such  changes  are  likely  to  trigger  substantial  sectorial  shifts  (Denton  and 
Spence, 1999; Fougère et al., 2007; Lefèbvre, 2008). 

Some important research has been done in this topic. Dewhurst (2006) used an input-output matrix, 
disaggregated for elderly and non-elderly, to quantify sectorial impacts of changes in consumption pattern 
associated to aging. Luhrmann (2005) using Almost  Ideal Demand System (AIDS) estimated household 
demand for goods and services in Germany between 2000 and 2040. Lefèbvre (2006) used a pseudo panel 
to examine the aging effect on aggregate consumption in Belgium in two steps. In the first step the author 
estimated the aging effect on the household expenditure of goods and services and in the second step, taking 
into account the household consumption composition, the author predicted the aggregated consumption by 
industrial sectors until 2050. Main results showed that an increase in expenditure on housing, health and 
leisure and reduction in expenditure on clothing, equipment and transport.   

Recently, Kim et al. (2015) have proposed an extension to the regional econometric input–output 
model  (REIM)  for  the  Chicago  region  integrated  into  a  demand  system  that  allows  heterogeneity  in 
household consumption. The authors used aggregate consumption data present in Consumer Expenditure 
Survey (CES) for the years of 1987–2011 and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to estimate the almost ideal 
demand system (AIDS) with age- or income group fixed effects.  In the extended model, distinct spending 
patterns by cohort are major forces that drive differentiated changes in output, employment, and income. 
The main conclusions reveal that a demographic change (e.g. an aging population) results in compositional 
changes in consumption in the long run, consequently influencing other variables.  

In  the  Brazilian  context,  Almeida  (2002),  using  data  from  The  Consumer  Expenditure  Survey 
(Pesquisa  de  Orçamento  Familiar  -  POF)  estimated,  for  Brazilian  metropolitan  areas,  the  consumption 
pattern  considering  two  types  of  households:  households  with  an  elderly  head  and  households  with  all 
residents aged below 60. Main results showed that increasing age increases the probability of consuming 
medicines products, goods and services related to health, and personal expenses and leisure. Similar work 
was  done  by  Neri  et  al.  (2004).  The  authors  compared  the  consumption  vector  observed  in  the  whole 
population with that one observed   in households in which the proportion of elderly people is equal or 
higher than 50%. Recently, Zanon (2012) by using an input-output matrix examined how population aging 
affects  the  Brazilian  productive  structure.  Data  from  Consumer  Expenditure  Survey-2008  was  used  to 
disaggregate household consumption vector between elderly households (households with at least 50% of 
elderly)  and  nonelderly  households  (households  with  less  than  50%  of  elderly).  All  of  these  studies 
indicated  that  population  aging  causes  an  increase  in  expenses  of  goods  and  services  related  to  health, 
domestic services, leisure goods and services in general. 

The aim of this paper is to estimate the association between household expenditure composition and 
the presence of children  and elderly individuals in  households. This  is the first  attempt to  estimate how 
household  expenditure  composition  varies  among  households  with  different  age  structure  in  Brazil.  A 
typology of households was built to take into account household age structure. Seven household  groups 

 
were  defined.  The  association  between  household  age  structure  and  consumption  composition  was 
estimated through econometric models. For each household group and each type of product a model was 
run  allowing  the  estimation  of  household-  type  semi-elasticity.  All  consumption  items  present  in 
Expenditure Consumption Survey were aggregated into 15 groups. In fact, 13 semi-elasticity’s coefficients 
were  estimated  for  each  type  of  household.  Finally,  a  consumption  vector  was  also  estimated  for  each 
household group making it possible to compare the consumption pattern among households with different 
age structure.

2.  Data 

 
This paper uses Consumer Expenditure Survey data set for the years of 2002-2003. This survey is 
carried  out  by  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics  (Instituto  Brasileiro  de  Geografia  e 
Estatística  –  IBGE,  2004)  every  five  years.  The  main  aim  of  this  survey  is  to  estimate  household 
consumption expenditure in order to subsidize the build of the National Consumer Price Index (INPC).  

The 2002/2003 survey contains information about the population living in urban and rural areas in 
Brazil. Its sample is representative for the 27 federal units, nine metropolitan areas, as well as for the whole 
country.  The  sample  size  included  182,333  individuals  living  in  48,470  households.  Data  collection  is 
conducted  through  six  questionnaires,  five  of  them  are  organized  according  to  type  of  expenditure:  1) 
household and residents characteristics; 2) collective expenditure in durable household goods 3) collective 
expenditure in  food  and  cleaning, 4) individual expenditure;  5) individual earnings  and wages.  The last 
questionnaire investigates living conditions perception (IBGE, 2004).  
 
In this paper, we use all collective and individual expenditure items calculated and annualized by 
IBGE. The expenditure of goods and services were mapped into 15 categories of goods and services: food, 
textiles and clothing, fuel and transportation, medicines, health insurance, inpatient care , durables goods, 
other  goods,  energy,  private  education,  financial  services  and  insurance,  services,  services  provided  to 
families, food consumed out of the household and housing. Services provided to families include mainly 
caregivers to elderly and children. All expenditures are calculated and annualized by IBGE. 
 
3. Household Typology 

 
In order to analyze aging effect on expenditure composition it is necessary to classify households 
according to the presence of elderly residents and children. The classification of households is done taking 
into account the number of adults (residents aged from 15 to 59 years stratified into two age groups), elderly 
persons (residents aged over than 59 stratified into three age groups) and children (residents aged from 0 to 
14 years stratified into three age groups) in the household. The disaggregation of elderly individuals and 
children by age is important to allow the use demographic projections, even though their use is out of the 
scope of this paper.  

Seven types of households were defined:  households  with  only two  adults;  households with  two 
adults and one child (0-4 years old, 5-9 years old, 10-14 years old); households with two adults aged from 
15 to 49 and one adult aged from 50 to 59; households with two adults aged from 15 to 49 years and one 
elderly  aged  from  60  to  69  and  finally  two  adults  aged  from  15  to  49  years  and  one  elderly  over  70´s. 
Households including only two adults (15-49) were considered as the reference category for the comparison 
of expenditure composition. In order to allow the identification of aging effect, households with elderly and 
children living together were excluded from the sample. The seven groups of households defined in our 
typology represents 20% of the total sample (48.470 households) surveyed by POF in 2002-2003, that is, 
9.516 households. Table 1 reports the distribution of households according to each group. The largest group 
corresponds to households with only two adults (3.221 observations).

Table 2 shows the distribution of expenditures disaggregated by the 15 groups of goods and services 
for each household type. It is worth mentioning that the most important expenditure items are common to 
all types of households. Independently of the presence of children or elderly residents, three groups of goods 
and services represent at least 40% of the whole budget: food, durable goods and housing. Despite of the 
same  consumption  pattern,  it  is  observed  that  the  consumption  of  food  increases  with  the  presence  of 
children or elderly in the household, while expenditure with durable goods highly decreases for households 
with  elderly  over  seventies.  Another  item  of  expenditure  sensitive  to  household  composition  is  the 
consumption of services that expand their participation from 6% in households with two adults to around 
15% for domiciles with two adults aged from 15 to 49 and one adult aged from 50 to 59 years. Regarding 
health  services,  the  presence  of  elderly  over  seventies  matter  for  health  insurance  and  inpatient  care 
expenditure. Even though these items do not represent high participation in the whole budget, they increase 
substantively:  health  insurance  expenditure  increases  from  1.3%  to  around  3%  for  households  with  one 
elderly over seventies. Finally private education expenditure is also conditioned on the presence of children 
in the household.

3.  Methodology 

 

The aim of this paper is to analyze the effects of household composition, especially the presence of 
elderly and child, will be explored in terms of the allocation of household expenditure on consumer goods. 
Specifically, the effects of presence of elderly and children are measured through the estimation of demand 
semi-elasticities of household composition. 

One difficulty of estimating  semi-elasticities on  household  expenditure regards data distribution. 
Usually,  there  is  a  large  portion  of  zeros,  especially  when  household  expenditure  is  disaggregated  by 
various products. The presence of high number of zeros occurs due to a significant fraction of households 
present  no  any  expenditure  on  various  products.  The  tables  1  and  2  in  the  Appendix  B  reports  the 
expenditure distributions for all product groups taking into account the household typology. One possible 
method of estimation is the Tobit Model which provides consistent estimates by maximum likelihood. The 
censored  regression  analysis  usually  applies  when  the  dependent  variable  is  censored.  Regarding 
expenditure  distributions,  observations  assume  only  non-negative  values,  which  means,  that  data 
distribution is left-censored at zero. In this cases, zero values are obtained as a result of the choice of optimal 
consumption vector.  

In a censored distribution, only values above the censoring point (in this case, expenditure = 0) are 
relevant for the estimation of the dependent variable, which means a non-negative expenditure constraint 
on the estimation of the  expenses5. Typically, the  Tobit model expresses the observed response (
) in 
terms of an underlying latent variable. The general formulation of the Tobit model can be represented by 
the following relation (Tobin, 1958):

5 The usual least squares estimator fails in this case, being biased even in large samples where: a) the zeros in the data are kept 
and treated like any other observation, or b) all zero observations are removed. Thus, the estimators for the coefficients would 
be inconsistent (Wooldridge, 2000; Cameron and Trivedi, 2005; Cameron and Trivedi, 2009).

The Tobit model is based on homoscedastic variance of the error term . If 

 – normal 
and homoscedastic – then the 
 estimator is consistent and efficient. Otherwise, it is inconsistent. Pagan 
and  Vella  (1989)  describe  the  conditional  moment  test  that  can  be  implemented  after  the  Tobit  model 
estimation. If one of the null hypothesis of normality or homoscedasticity of errors is discarded, one option 
is  to  use  the  Censored  Least  Absolute  Deviations  (CLAD)  estimator  (Powell,  1984;  Wooldridge,  2000; 
Cameron and Trivedi, 2005), which is consistent since the median

The CLAD estimator is a generalization of the semiparametric estimator Least Absolute Deviations 
(LAD)  proposed  by  Powell  (1984)  as  an  alternative  to  the  Tobit  model  when  data  distribution  is 
heteroscedastic. Unlike the standard censored regression estimator, Tobit, or other approaches by maximum 
likelihood, the CLAD estimator is robust to heteroscedasticity being consistent and asymptotically normal 
for a wide class of error distributions. The properties of the LAD estimator are presented in Koenker and 
Basset (1978).

For the linear model, the CLAD method provides estimates of regression coefficients by minimizing 
the sum of absolute residuals. It is a generalization of the sample median to the context of regression as 

 is 
well as OLS is a generalization of the sample mean to the linear model. If the dependent variable 
observed, then the median is the regression function 
 under the condition that the errors have a median 
equals zero. Thus, the estimated CLAD can be used to estimate the unknown coefficients (Wilhelm, 2008). 
Powell shows that the consistency of this estimator does not depend on any other assumption about 
the error distribution. Thus, 
 is robust to heteroscedasticity, consistent, and asymptotically normal for a 
wide class of error distributions, since it only considers the median equals zero (see Deaton, 1997, Powell,

1984 and Buchinsky, 1994). The CLAD estimation procedure is operational by an algorithm proposed by 
Buchinsky (1994) 7. 

As  a  limitation  of  the  model,  the  estimator  requires  that  at  least  50%  of  the  observations  are 
uncensored. However, in some cases, depending on the context analyzed, another quantile than the median 
can be used in estimate and the parameters are obtained from a censored quantile regression model (for 
further details see Wooldridge, 2000; Buchinsky, 1994).

3.2 Model Specification  
 

In  this  paper,  an  econometric  model  CLAD  is  run  to  estimate  the  semi-elasticities  of  types  of 
households.  y. Additionally, a bootstrap procedure is estimated to obtain consistent estimations of standard 
errors. The data source is 2002-2003 POF. One model for each product (except food and housing) and each 
household  type  is  estimated  in  order  to  obtain  semi-elasticities  of  household  composition.  Six  different 
specifications  for  each  product  (13)  are  estimated.  For  all  models  the  household  reference  category  are  
households  with  only  two  adults  living.  Semi-elasticities  on  food  and  housing  expenditures  are  not 
estimated  because  these  types  of  expenditure  are  common  to  all  individuals  living  in  the  household, 
therefore it is not adequate to assume that elderly or children living in the domicile can cause variations in 
the budget share of these consumption items. 

In all household typologies only 25% of total households present positive expenditures on health 
insurance and education (See Appendix A). Specifically for inpatient care, only 10% of households spend 
with this product. As noted earlier, a limitation of the CLAD model lies in the fact that the estimator requires 
that at least 50% of the observations are uncensored. In that manner, it is not possible to estimate median 
semi-elaticities  for  these  three  products  (education,  hospital  care,  health  insurance).  In  order  to  find  a 
solution,  these  products´  estimation  were  done  using  other  quantiles.  In  these  cases,  Least  Absolute 
Deviations (LAD) model was used. For each type of household (k) 13 models were estimated corresponding 
to different products (i).  To accomplish this task 78 models were estimated, 13 products and 6 types of 
household.  

Table  3  describes  dependent  and  independent  variables  included  in  the  estimation.  Independent 
variables regards socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of households. The dependent variables 
are the annual expenditure per product for each household typology. Households were classified in seven 
categories according to the number of adults, elderly and children: households with two adults, two adults 
and one child aged 0-4, two adults and a child of 5-9 years, two adults and one child 10-14, two adults and 
one adult aged 50-59, two adults and an elderly 60-69, two adults and an elderly 70 years or more. The total 
sample  was  split  into  k  groups  according  to  household  typology.  Each  subsample  was  composed  by 
households with only two adults and households for each type defined in the household typology. In order 
to identify each type of household a dummy variable was built corresponding to zero if the household is 
composed by two adults (reference category) and 0 otherwise. 

 These  dummy  variables  aim  to  capture  marginal  effects  on  consumption  of  goods  and  services 

resulting from the presence of children and elderly in the domiciles. 

Control  variables  concerns  socioeconomic  status,  head  of  household  characteristics  and  local  of 
residence. The annual total expenditure per capita is used as independent variable instead of the total annual 
income.  Annual  total  expenditure  is  a  proxy  for  household  permanent  income,  being  therefore,  more 
adequate  to  estimate  marginal  effects  regarding  household  composition.  Usually  household  expenditure 
fluctuates  less  than  income  because  individuals  can  use  savings  or  credit  to  finance  their  consumption. 
Besides, it is less subject to measurement errors in the Consumer Expenditure Survey because individuals 
have to register all expenditures in a booklet provided by the interviewer while income information is self-
reported. Schooling of household head is also included in the model as proxy variable to socioeconomic 
status.  It  also  allows  to  control  for  information  effect.  Individuals  can  choose  to  consume  differently 
conditioned on their information. It is particularly important for healthcare services and goods. The local

of residence is  included  because there may be regional differences in  the cost  of living.   A categorical 
variable was built considering 5 great regions in Brazil: Southeast, Northeast, North, South and Midwest.

4.  Results  
 

This paper used the CLAD approach to estimate censored models instead of Tobit models. Tobit 
models are usually adequate for dependent variables presenting normal and homoscedastic distributions. 
The  test  results  regarding  Tobit  estimations  rejected  the  null  hypothesis  that  the  data  come  from  a  normally 
distributed  population  (Appendix  B).  Table  1  of  Appendix  B  shows  that  Tobit  estimations  presented 
heteroscedastic  and  non-normal  distribution  of  errors,  resulting  in  inconsistent  estimated  parameters 
(Wooldridge,  2000;  Cameron  and  Trivedi,  2005;  Powell,  1984).  According  to  Wilhelm  (2008)  when 
heteroscedasticity  or  non-normality  cause  bias,  CLAD  model  proposed  by  Powell  (1984)  is  the  best 
alternative to the censored regression. Given the large number of models (78 differ models), this section 
focus on the main results concerning the coefficients of the six household dummies. Full results are reported 
in Appendix C8. All estimations were implemented using Stata 11 software. 

In  general,  the  models  present  a  satisfactory  goodness  of  fit  to  the  data.  Most  of  the  estimated 
coefficients for control variables are statistically significant. Table 4 reports the marginal effects estimated 
for each type of household using CLAD.  As the dependent variable is the logarithm of the expenditure 
with each product, household dummy coefficients can be interpreted as semi-elasticities since captures the 
marginal effect of the presence of an elderly person or to a child at domiciles compared to the reference 
household. The reference category are households with only two adults living.  

Analyzing the dummies coefficients, the results corroborate the hypothesis tested: households with 
elderly or children show different  patterns of consumption when compared to  households  composed by 
only  two  adults.  For  all  types  of  household  composition  marginal  effects  are  greater  for  health-related 
goods,  specifically  health  insurance  and  inpatient  care.  Other  important  result  regards  the  association 
between age and medicines expenditure. The semi-elasticity estimated for medicine´s expenditure increases 
monotonically with elderly age.  

Private education expenditure also shows association with presence of children in the household. 
Semi-elasticities estimated points out  the expected effect,  a higher increment is  found for children aged 
between 5 and 15. This association is also important for household with adults aged between 50 and 59. 
This pattern can be related to university expenses to youth.

Concerning medicines expenditure (third row of Table 4), it is observed that the presence of one 
elderly persons aged over 70 increases this annual expenditure in 187% compared to households with only 
two adults living. A smaller effect is also found for the presence of children in households. For households 
with two adults and one child, independently of child age, the coefficient is always higher than zero and 
significant. Besides there is a child age effect on household expenditure on medicines. Child growth reduces 
the needs of medicines as their immunological is more developed. The coefficient decreases as the child 
age increases, showing that there is life-cycle effect on this type of expenditure. For households with the 
presence of one child aged between 0-4 years this coefficient is 0.94, decreasing to 0.72 for the presence of   
a child aged between 5-9 years and to 0.49 for the presence of a child aged between 10-14 years.  

With respect to health insurance expenditure (Table 4), the magnitude of the effect associated to the 
presence of children and elderly individuals is very high. The presence of one child aged between 0-4 years 
increases  the  health  insurance  expenditure  in  319%  compared  to  households  with  two  adults  while  the 
presence of an elderly person aged over 70 increases this type of expenditure in 208%. An age effect is also 
observed for this type of health expenditure. Estimated semi-elasticities present a well-behaved pattern, the 
U-curve. It starts with a high effect for children aged 0-4 (319%), after decreases as child age increases and 
then increases with age of elderly individuals. 

The  expenditure  effect  associated  to  inpatient  care  is  also  important  mainly  to  households  with 
elderly person aged over 70. In these households this expenditure increases by 217 % when compared to 
households  composed  of  only  two  adults  (Table  4).  Despite  this  significant  association,  age  effect  on 
inpatient care expenses is not well behaved as it was observed for other types of healthcare expenditure. In 
this case the U-shaped curve is not observed.  This different pattern is probably related to acute events that 
occur independently of age.   

 

5.  Conclusion 
 

This paper investigated the empirical relationship between household expenditure composition and 
the  presence  of  children  and  elderly  individuals  in  households  of  Brazil.  For  this,  it  was  proposed  a 
methodology to  disaggregate the consumer expenditure  by  age  groups using the Consumer Expenditure 
Survey  (2002-2003).  As  the  information  of  Consumer  Expenditure  Survey  of  Brazil  is  aggregated  by 
households, the CLAD model was used to capture the marginal effects of each age group (adults, elderly, 
and children) in household expenditure. 

Similar  to  what  other  studies  (e.g.  Luhrmann,  2005;  Dewhurst,  2006,  Lefèbvre,  2006;  Almeida, 
2002; Zanon, 2012), the results showed that changes in the age structure of the population have significant 
effects  on  Brazilian  aggregate  consumption.  The  results  obtained  in  the  econometric  model  revealed 
different consumption patterns depending on the household type. 

 Analyzing the dummies coefficients, the results showed that the presence of children and elderly 
individuals changed the  consumption pattern resulting in  different  budget  allocation favoring healthcare 
expenditure. For the healthcare categories expenditure, semi-elasticities increased monotonically with age. 
The results also showed that expenditures on medicines are more important for extreme age groups, which 
means in the age group between zero and four years old and in the age group for persons 70 years old or 
more. 

This  paper  is  the  first  attempt  to  estimate  effects  of  changing  population  age  structure  over 
consumption  profiles.  Results  showed  that  aging  can  affect  aggregate  demand  through  changes  in 
consumption pattern. The parameters estimated in this paper can subsidize public policy and planning of 
healthcare supply and other goods and services.
