Water  using restrictions  and  their  economic  impacts  in  the Sub-Middle  Hydrographic 

Region of the São Francisco  River Basin in Brazil 

RESUMO 
Atualmente,  há  muita  discussão  sobre  os  desafios  de  combinar  questões  econômicas  e 
ambientais.  O  governo  brasileiro  tem  investido  na  expansão  das  áreas  irrigadas,  especialmente  no 
Nordeste  do  Brasil.  O  Projeto  de  Transferência  de  Água  do  São  Francisco,  que  envolve  recursos 
da  ordem  de  R  $  8,2  bilhões,  procura  expandir  a  infra-estrutura  de  água  para  abastecer  a  Bacia 
Sub-Médio  do  Rio  São  Francisco.  A  água  para  os  novos  projetos  de  irrigação  no  Nordeste  virá 
diretamente  do  rio  São  Francisco  ou  dos  canais  em  construção.  Há  estimativas  de  que,  em  cerca 
de  três  décadas,  a  área  sob  irrigação  fornecida  pela  bacia  Sub-Médio  poderia  aumentar  em  mais 
de  10  vezes  sua  média  atual.  Juntos,  as  mudanças  climáticas  e  a  expansão  das  áreas  irrigadas  no 
Nordeste  podem  aumentar  os  conflitos  entre  outros  usos  da  água.  Neste  contexto,  devem  ser 
estabelecidas  políticas  públicas  para  promover  esquemas  de  alocação  de  água  inter  e  intra-
setoriais  mais  eficientes.  Este  estudo  usou  uma  matriz  regional  de  insumo-produto  ano  2010 
adaptada  para  a  região  hidrográfica  do  Sub-Médio  São  Francisco  (IO-SMSF),  para  simular 
impactos  econômicos  que  acompanham  mudanças  na  disponibilidade  de  água  pelo  setor 
econômico  na  sub-bacia  de  acordo  com  decisões  de  alocação  de  água.  Os  resultados  indicaram 
até  que  ponto  a  restrição  de  água  impacta  a  produção  de  atividades  altamente  dependentes,  como 
a  agricultura  e  o  emprego  local.  Os  resultados  obtidos  fornecem  uma  medida  para  os  custos  de 
oportunidade  de  usar  a  água  para  fins  diferentes  das  necessidades  locais.  Palavras  Chave:

ABSTRACT   
the  challenges  of  combining  economic  and 
Currently 
environmental  issues.  The  Brazilian  government  has  been  investing  the  expansion  of  irrigated 
areas,  especially  in  the  Northeast  of  Brazil.  The  São  Francisco  Water  Transfer  Project,  involving 
resources  on  the  order  of  R$  8.2  billion,  seeks  to  expand  the  water  infrastructure  to  deliver  water 
from  the  Sub-Middle  São  Francisco  River  Basin.  The  water  for  a  significant  part  of  the  new 
irrigation  projects  in  Northeast  will  either  come  directly  from  the  São  Francisco  River  or  from 
the  channels  being  constructed.  There  are  estimates  that  in  about  three  decades,  the  area  under 
irrigation  supplied  by  the  Sub-Middle  basin  could  increase  by  more  than  10  times  its  current 
average.  Together,  climate  changes  and  expansion  of  irrigated  areas  in  Northeast  may  increase 
conflicts  between  other  water  uses.  In  this  context,  public  policies  must  be  established  to 
promote  more  efficient  inter  -and  intra-  sector  water  allocation  schemes.  This  study  used  a 
regional  2010  Input-output  matrix  adapted  for  the  Sub-Middle  hydrographic  region  of  the  São 
Francisco  river  basin  (IO-SMSF),  to  simulate  economic  impacts  accompanying  changes  in  water 
availability  by  economic  sector  in  the  sub-basin  according  to  water  allocation  decisions.  The 
results  indicated  the  extent  to  which  water  using  restrictions  impacts  on  production  of  highly 
water  dependent  activities 
like  agriculture  and  on  local  employment.  The  obtained  results 
provide  a  measure  for  the  opportunity  costs  of  using  water  for  purposes  other  than  the  local 
necessities.  Keywords:  Input-Output,  water resources  and transposition.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Although  Brazil  has  about  12%  of  the  available  fresh  water  on  the  planet,  about  80%  of  this 
water  is  in  the  Amazon,  and  the  remaining  20%  is  unevenly  distributed  among  the  other  regions. 
Currently,  irrigated  agriculture  in  Brazil  is  the  largest  consumer  of  fresh  water  available  on  the 
surface,  with  61%  of  water  diverted  from  rivers  and  lakes  for  irrigation.  The  largest  share  of 
irrigated  area  is  in  the  Southeast  with  37%,  followed  by  the  South  with  27%,  22%  in  the 
Northeast,  the  Midwest  and  the  North  with  12%  and  2%  respectively.  Despite  being  a  naturally 
dry  region,  and  not  being  one  of  the  most  irrigated,  the  Northeast  (NE)  region  produces  about 
30%  of  national  agricultural  production,  only  behind  the  South  East  (54%),  which  demonstrates 
the  potential  of irrigation  in  this  region  (IBGE,  2006).  

The  São  Francisco  River  Basin  provides  approximately  70  per  cent  of  the  surface  water  for  the 
Northeast  of  Brazil.  About  95  percent  of  the  irrigation  projects  in  the  NE  region  use  surface 
water  diverted  from  the  regional  rivers,  particularly  the  São  Francisco  River.  The  basin  takes  up 
about  8  per  cent  of  Brazil’s  area  and  the  river  has  an  average  annual  flow  of  about  three  thousand 
cubic  meters  per  second.  The  basin  has  a  diverse  ecosystem  with  average  temperatures  ranging 
from  20  degrees  Celsius  in  the  center-southern  portion  of  the  basin  to  twenty-six  degrees  Celsius 
in  the  northeastern  areas.  The  rainfall  rates  also  differ  both  seasonally  and  in  the  different  areas. 
Because  of  these  differences,  policy  makers  and  institutional  researchers  have  divided  the  basin 
into  four  hydrographic  sub-  regions:  from  the  highlands,  through  a  middle  region  and  then  a  sub-
middle  region,  to sea level  when  it  nears  the ocean. 

Among  these  hydrographic  regions,  the  Sub-Middle  (SM-SFRB)  hydrographic  region  is  the 
driest  one.  The  region  (SM-SFRB)  contributes  to  water  availability  in  the  overall  basin  with  an 
inflow  of  approximately  4%.  The  different  water  demands  in  the  region  represent  33%  of  the 
entire  basin.  Related  to  the  water  uses  /  users,  there  is  a  history  of  a  series  of  conflicts  in  this 
region.  Currently, 
irrigated 
agriculture.  There  are  important  and  large  reservoirs  that  were  built  for  electricity  generation  and 
are  essential  for  river  control  (to  avoid  floods  and  ensure  navigation)  and  hydro  electric 
generation  for the  region.   

that  between  electricity  generation  and 

the  most 

important 

is 

The  Sub-Middle  region  also  includes  a  highly  diverse  agricultural  system  that  includes  well-
capitalized  export-focused  enterprises,  medium-  and  small-scale  commercial  farmers  and  semi-
subsistence  farmers.  In  Brazil  as  a  whole,  irrigated  agriculture  can  be  divided  into  private  and 
public  schemes.  Public  schemes  or  projects  are  mostly  in  the  northeast  region  (67  percent  of  the 
total  irrigated  area  in  1996).  These  are  based  in  complex  productive  systems  and  capital  and 
water    intensive  use  (CASTRO,  2011;  DNOCS,  2013;  CODEVASF,  2013)  and  in  charge  of  two 
federal  institutions:  Companhia  de  Desenvolvimento  do  Vale  do  São  Francisco    (CODEVASF) 
and (DNOCS). 

As  the  driest  part  of  the  basin  and  with  conflicts  already  established,  the  SM-SFRB  had  all  of  its 
sub-basins  classified  as  critical  or  with  an  indispensable  need  for  management,  according  to  an 
evaluation  of  availability  and  water  resources  demand  made  by  the  United  Nations,  and 
publicized  a  decade  ago  in  the  Ten  Year  Plan  of  the  São  Francisco  Basin  Committee  (CBHSF, 
2004).

This  conflict  between  irrigated  agriculture  and  energy  production  has  the  potential  to  worsen 
over  time.  Starting  from  the  San  Francisco  River  Basin,  two  channels  (are  being  built  to  deliver 
water  to  the  north  and  the  east  of  the  region.  This  large  water  transfer  project  is  known  as  the 
Transboundary  Project  of  São  Francisco  River  (Projeto  de  Transposição  do  São  Francisco  - 
PTSF).    In  response  to  this  project,  many  public/  private  irrigation  schemes  have  been  projected 
and  are  expected  to  increase  the  areas  under  irrigation  in  the  whole  of  the  Northeast.    The  water 
for  the  significant  part  of  these  new  irrigation  projects  will  either  come  directly  from  the  San 
Francisco  River  or  from  the  artificial  canals  being  constructed.  There  are  estimates  that  in  about 
three  decades,  the  area  under  irrigation  supplied  by  that  region  could  increase  by  10  times  the 
number  of  hectares  affected.  This  can  worsen  the  conflict  of  use  already  existing  between 
irrigated  agriculture  and energy  production  (MORAES,  et al.,  2016). 

In  this  context,  public  policies  must  be  established  to  promote  more  efficient  inter-  and  intra-
sector  water  allocation  schemes.  Economic  models  are  able  to  support  effective  management 
instruments  that  induce  economically  optimal  and  equitable  allocations.  It  is  very  important  that 
evaluations  of  water  allocation  policies  consider  direct  and  indirect  economic  impacts.  Different 
water  allocation  values  not  only  lead  to  different  economic  impacts,  affecting  all  water  users  and 
uses,  but  also  have  backward  and  forward  linkages  associated  with  the  inputs  and  outputs  of  the 
production  cycle.  Moreover,  impacts  need  to  be  differentiated  according  to  different  social  strata 
to assess  impacts  on the  most  vulnerable  and the poorest  users  (ROGERS  et al.,  1998). 

The  question  of  measurements  of  indirect  and  sector-based  economic  impacts  of  water  policies 
(the  demand  management  side) 
the  large  and  growing 
significance  of  these  impacts.  Water  policy  impacts  can  also  be  compared  in  terms  of  impacts  on 
job creation  and welfare  (UNEP, 2011).

is  of  particular 

The  present  study  used  a  regional  Input-output  matrix  adapted  for  the  Sub-Middle  hydrographic 
region  of  the  São  Francisco  river  basin  (IO-SM-SFRB),  to  simulate  direct  and  indirect  economic 
impacts  from  different  strategies  used  in  supply  and  demand  management.  An  increase  in 
demand  for  sugarcane  for  ethanol  production  as  well  as  a  decrease  in  water  production  for 
agriculture  in  the  basin,  due  to  transposition,  were  simulated  and  the  effects  of  final  demand  and 
production  were measured  using  a regionalized  Matrix. 

This  article  presents,  in  addition  to  this  introduction,  four  more  sessions:  methodology  where  it  is 
described  how  the  regional  input-ouput  table  was  computed  and  how  the  water  consumption

2. METHODOLOGY   

 

2.1 Regional Input-Output  Model

The  input-output  model  is  a  recommended  methodology  for  measuring  economic  impact  taking 
into  consideration  the  inter–sectoral  linkage  of  a  given  region  or  country.  The  degree  of 
interdependence  among  the  sectors  of  an  economy  can  be  assessed  through  the  inter-sectoral 
requirement  coefficients  of 
input-output  matrixes  can  be 
elaborated  in  two  ways:  by  using  research  performed  directly  with  data  relating  to  the  regional 
economy  (survey  methods)  and  by  regionalizing  national 
input-output  matrixes  (non-survey 
methods).  Since  the  costs  involved  in  direct  research  are  prohibitive,  the  usual  method  is  to  resort 
to regionalization  procedures.

The  method  for  regionalizing  a  national  input-output  matrix  used  here  is  the  Location  Quotient 
(LQ)  method.  This  mixes  survey-type  procedures  with  non-survey  routines  (KRONENBERG, 
R,  is  related  to  the 
2009).  The  LQ  method  assumes  that  each  regional  technical  coefficient  aij

To  estimate tij,  which  quantifies 
technical 
coefficients,  the  relative  importance  of  an  industry  is  considered.  This  importance  is  determined 
precisely  by  the  Location  Quotient  (LQ):  LQ  “(...)  is  a  measurement  that  compares  the  relative 
importance  of  an 
the  nation” 
(RICHARDSON,  1978, p. 120).

However,  if  LQi  <  1,  this  means  that  activity  “i”  is  underrepresented  in  the  productive  structure 
of  the  region,  in  comparison  with  the  national  situation.  Therefore,  this  region  absorbs  national 
production  in  this  sector,  making  it  an  importer  (KRONENBERG,  2009).  In  Equation  1,  tij  is 
replaced  by the  LQi value  calculated. 

In  the  case  where  LQi  >  1,  sector  “i”  meets  local  needs.  In  this  case,  and  in cases where LQ i = 1, 
tij = 1:  i.e.  the  regional  technical  coefficient  is  equal  to  the  national  one.  Thus  it  is  possible  to

The  result  presents  a  regional  Input-Output  matrix  (MIPR).  In  this  article,  it  was  not  necessary  to 
estimate  the  value  of  regional  production  (XR)  by  means  of  the  Location  Quotient,  since  the 
Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and  Statistics  (IBGE)  provides  official  regional  accounts  for 
Brazil  and  for  the  states  for  22  sectors.  The  municipal  GDPs  weighted  by  the  gross  value  of 
production  of  the  regional  accounts  of  the  states  of  Pernambuco  and  Bahia  were  used  as  the 
production  value  for  the  regional  matrix.  The  RAS  method  was  applied  to  correct  possible 
imbalances. 

The  Sub-Middle  São  Francisco  River  basin  (SMSF)  comprises  13  municipalities  over  two 
Brazilian  states:  Pernambuco  and  Bahia.  In  these  municipalities  about  32%  of  the  workers  are 
employed  in  rural  activities.  Then,  water  availability  is  essential  for  local  economies  and  its 
scarcity  may  induce  important  negative  effects  on  income  and  jobs.  In  this  work  we  will  discuss 
the  methodology  of our  study,  the  database, and the  results.

The  input-output  model  can  cover  extensions,  incorporating  the  use  of  water.  The  technical 
coefficients  of  direct  water  use  measure  the  primary  water  use  factor  as  input  from  the  various 
economic  sectors.  Using  the  coefficients  obtained,  both  the  Direct  and  Indirect  Effects  on  the 
Regional  economy  of  the  different  limitations  in  the  water  input  can  be  measured  by  different 
allocation  policies  used in  the basins,  as described  below.

2.2 Water Supply 

The 
technical  coefficients  of  direct  water  use  are  one  of  the  so-called  Exogenous  Input 
Coefficients  (NAKAMURA  and  KONDO,  2009).  Through  these,  it  is  possible  to  measure  the 
effects  on  the  economy  of  a  limitation  in  water  resources,  resulting  from  changes  in  the  supply  or 
demand  management  of  the river  basins. 

To  obtain  the  technical  coefficients  of  water  use,  the  inputs  needed  for  production  are  divided 
into  endogenous  and  exogenous  inputs.  The  endogenous  inputs  are  the  economic  ones  and  the 
exogenous  ones  are the  environmental  inputs,  in  this  work that  is  the 'water  supply'. 

 

Proces =  ( Input
Output

Where:    

   x′i  = i’s  Endogenous  inputs; 

               z′i  = i’s  exogenous  inputs  (water); 
               x′   = Production  of  the good x; 
               w′  = Waste production. 

) = (

)      

x′i

(7) 

If  we  divide  the  endogenous  and  exogenous  inputs  by  the  production,  that  is,  the  amount  of 
inputs  (endogenous  and exogenous)  needed to produce a unit  of  x: 

i
x′

ai = x′
bi = z′

x′

;                                                                            (8) 

.                                                                            (9) 

As  all  inputs,  both  endogenous  and  exogenous,  are  required  for  the  production  of  an  end  product, 
then  assumption  is  made  that  xi > 0  and  zi > 0,  for  all  i.  And,  by  definition,  ai > 0  and  bi > 0. 
Rewriting: 

i =  ai. x ′;        
x ′
z′
i =  bi. x ′.         

 

 

 

 

                                (10) 

                               (11) 

However,  the  hypothesis  ai > 0  is  required,  which  means  that  x ′
i < ′,  that  is,  the  input  amount 
has  to  be  less  than  the  product  amount,  but  this  alone  is  not  a  sufficient  condition.  If  ai ≥ 1,  the 
amount  of  product  does  not  exceed  the  amount  of  input  used  in  production,  then  the  process  is 
not  efficient.  Therefore,  the  sufficient  condition  is  0 < ai < 1.  Consider  a  model  with  n  sectors. 
Dividing  the demand  into  the  intermediate  and final  demand  gives: 

 

 

 

 

  xj = xij + yj.                    

 

     xj = aij. xj + yj.            

 

 

 

                    (12)   

 

           (13) 

Where  aij. xj  is  the  intermediate  demand  for  good  j  and  yj  the  final  demand  for  good  j.

    B̂ = Matrix  Exogenous  Input  Coefficients  (n x n); 

 

When  the  matrix  B  corresponds  to  water,  then  the  application  of  the  above  equation  in  the  input-
output  model  allows  the  calculation  of  virtual  water  [B̂(I − A)−1].  Otherwise,  the  vector  Z  takes 
into  account  the  direct  and  indirect  needs  of  water  in  the  economy.  As  the  water-associated 
element  of  vector  B  represents  the  direct  needs  of  each  sector,  then  Leontier’s  matrix  aggregates 
the  two to represent  the total  impact.     

As  the  exogenous  /  environmental  inputs  are  usually  scarce,  their  supply  is  limited.  Substituting 
Equation  (18) into  Equation  (19), it  is obtained  Z = B̂X. Considering  that  Z is scarce: 

 

 

 

X ≤ B̂ −1Z         

 

 

 

 

 (20)

That  is,  production  is  limited  by the  water  input. 

Using  the  technical  coefficients  (B)  and  different  water  distributions  it  can  be  predicted  the 
maximum  economic  return,  or  economic  production  due  to  water.  This  means  that  we  can 
associate  different  allocations  of  water  with  different  economic  products  by  sector.  In  addition, 
this  reallocation  will  also  cause  a  variation  in  the  final  demand.  Rewriting  Equation  (19),  we 
have: 

                      Y = (I − A)(B̂)−1Z                

 

 

 

      (21) 

 

In  this  way,  it  is  possible  to  realize  that  a  reallocation  of  scarce  input,  water,  which  can  be 
simulated  for  different  allocation  models,  resulting  in  different  values  of  Z,  which  causes  a 
change  in  production,  X,  and  in  the  final  demand,  Y  (NAKAMURA  and  KONDO,  2009).  This 
then  can  be  measured  using  the  technical  coefficients  (vector  B)  and  the  input-output  matrix  of 
the  region  (matrix  A). 

As  the  region  to  be  evaluated  is  the  sum  of  the  municipalities  of  the  Sub-Medium  basin,  it  is 
hereafter  referred  to  as  the  Sub-Medium  of  São  Francisco  (SBSF).  This  work  had  the  objective 
of  simulating  the  possible  scenarios  of  water  management  in  the  SBSF  (ΔZ),  especially  for 
irrigated  agriculture.  Following  this,  to  estimate  the  consequence  on  the  demand  (ΔY),  the 
production  (ΔX)  and employment  (ΔL): 

∆Y = (I − A)(B̂)−1∆Z             
∆X = (I − A)−1∆Y              

 

    ∆L = EMP̂ ∙ ∆X

3. DATABASE    

As  a  database  to  estimate  the  IO-SMSF  we  have  the  IO-Brazil  (2010),  the  Brazilian  Regional 
Accounts  2010  and  the  municipal  GDP  from  IBGE.  Some  procedures  were  adopted  to  aggregate 
this  information  into  tables  that  relate  demand  and  supply  to  the  eighteen  sectors.  The  first 
procedure  was  to  aggregate  the  53  sectors  of  the  national  input-output  matrix  to  the  18  sectors  of 
our study.  

The  information  for  the  Brazilian  VBP  is  available  in  the  National  Accounts  System,  while  the 
information  for  the  states  of  Pernambuco  and  Bahia  can  be  found  in  the  Regional  Accounts.  The 
two  pieces  of  information  were  already  available  for  the  new  GDP  calculation  methodology.  To 
estimate  the  VBP  of  the  sectors  in  the  Municipal  Accounts,  the  procedure  was  somewhat 
different.  This  is  because  there  is  no  information  available  for  the  Gross  Value  of  Municipal 
Production,  neither  by  sector  nor  by  aggregate.  The  assumption  adopted  here  was  that  the 
technology  employed  in  each  sector  in  the  regions  was  similar  to  the  technology  employed  in  the 
state.  Thus,  the  participation  of  the  Intermediate  Consumption  Sector  in  the  sector's  VBP  for  the 
State would  be similar  to the  municipalities.  On the basis  of  this  hypothesis:

R  is  the  value  to  be  estimated  for  the  VBP  of  sector  i  in  the  region  R.  VPBi

sector  i  in  region  R.  Information  on  VA  in  municipalities  was  available  aggregated  for  four 
sectors  (Agriculture  and  Livestock,  Industries,  Services  and  Public  Administration).  Thus,  the 
estimation  was  made  considering  these  sectors.  After  using  the  Location  Quotient  method,  we 
obtained  the  regional  coefficient  matrix,  the  regional  product  vector,  and  the  regional  inter-
industry  consumption  matrix.   

The  direct  coefficients  of  water  use  were  identified  for  irrigated  agriculture,  livestock,  industry 
and  services.  To  estimate  the  direct  coefficients  of  water  use  for  irrigated  agriculture  in  the 
region,  the  Technical  Coefficients  Matrix  for  Water  Resources  published  by  FEBRABAN  in 
2011  was  used  as  the  basis.  For  livestock,  the  coefficient  of  withdrawal  per  animal  (liters/day) 
per  type  of  animal  published  by  Funarbe,  2011  was  used.  This  coefficient  was  applied  to  the 
number  of  heads  for  the  municipalities  of  the  SBSF.  For  all  other  sectors,  the  IWE-MAIN 
coefficient  applied  to  the  number  of  persons  employed  by  sector  (in  the  municipalities  of  the 
SBSF) as published  in  the 2010 IBGE  demographic  census  was used.

4. RESULTS   

The  sectors  that  generated  the  largest  production  in  the  region  are:  public  administration, 
manufacturing  industry  and  agriculture  (sum  of  temporary  agriculture,  permanent  and  livestock). 
However,  the  sectors  that  use  the  most  amount  of  water  (Z)  are  the  agricultural  ones,  as 
expected.  All  sectors  together  consumes  29%  of  water  flow.  agricultural  alone  accounted  for 
approximately  27% of this  flow.  Table  2 presents  the main  results  of IOM-SBSF 2010.

The  agriculture  and  livestock  sectors  are  the  ones  that  use  the  most  water  in  the  SBSF,  with  the 
highest  direct  coefficients  (B).  Therefore,  these  are  the  sectors  that  present  the  greatest  Virtual 
Water  consumption  (Total  effect).  High-user  non-agricultural  sectors  include  food  and  domestic 
services.  The  manufacturing  industry  stands  out  among  the  non-agricultural  sectors  in  relation  to 
Virtual  Water  use.    Despite  its  low  direct  coefficient,  both  its  participation  in  production  and 

large  indirect  effect  increases  its  weight  on the Virtual  Water effect. 

 

 

The  SBSF  Region  is  a  major  exporter  of  fruit  (Sector  2,  Permanent  Agriculture),  and  potential 
producer  of  sugar  cane  (Sector  1,  Temporary  Agriculture).  To  understand  the  direct  and  indirect 

effects  of  the  increase  in  demand  in  this  sector,  assuming  an  increase  in  exports,  for  example,  the 
impact  of this  increase  (1 R$ million  more  in  the  demand  for  this  sector)  is shown  in  Table  3.

Analyzing  the  impact  on  product  (third  column  on  Table  3),  an  increase  of  1  R$  million  in  the 
demand  for  permanent  agriculture  would  generate  a  total  increase  in  the  product  of  1.31  R$ 
million  for  the  local  economy.  That  is,  1.00  million  for  the  sector  itself.  In  the  case  of  production, 
this  would  spread  not 
the  non-agricultural  ones:  The 
manufacturing  industry  (0.105  R$  million),  commerce  (0.054  R$  million)  and  electricity  (0.04 
R$ million).   

the  agricultural  sectors,  but

With  regard  to  the  employment  generated  (fourth  column  on  Table  3),  almost  all  the  effect  is  on 
the  sector  itself.  The  demand  shock  would  generate  a  total  of  95  jobs,  of  which  86  would  be  in 
the  sector  itself.  Others  for  the  sectors,  temporary  agriculture,  livestock,  commerce  and  services. 
For  effect  on  virtual  water  (final  column  on  Table  3),  the  demand  shock  would  generate  a  total 
impact  of 850.07 million  m3 of water  (27 m3/sec).

In  addition  to  the  demand  shock,  we  simulated  the  supply  shock  on  the  exogenous  water  supply. 
In  this  case,  we  supposed  a  decrease  in  the  available  water  for  the  productive  sectors  of  the  São 
Francisco  sub-middle  basin  as a consequence  of  the river  transposition. 

As  mentioned  above,  the  project  of  integration  of  the  São  Francisco  River  (PISF),  a  project  of  the 
Federal  Government,  was  conceived  with  the  objective  of  guaranteeing  water  supply  for  the 
semi-arid  region  of  the  four  States  of  the  Northern  Northeast  (Paraíba,  Pernambuco,  Rio  Grande 
do  Norte  and  Ceará).  Two  hydraulic  systems  are  being  built  (North  Axis  and  East  Axis)  and  will 
be operated and maintained  by the  Parnaíba  and São Francisco  Valley  Development  Company  -  

The  North  Axis  has  an  extension  of  about  400  kilometers  and  is  composed  of  three  pumping 
systems  with  a  total  height  of  169  m  and  is  designed  for  a  maximum  capacity  of  99  m³/s.  The 
North  Axis  will  operate  with  a  continuous  flow  of  16.4  m³/s.  The  East  Axis  has  an  extension  of 
about  220  kilometers  to  the  Paraíba  River  and  its  storage  in  the  Itaparica  reservoir,  for  a 
maximum  capacity  of  28  m³/s,  the  East  Axis  will  operate  with  a  continuous  flow  of  10  m³/s 
(CASTRO, 2011). 

The  supply  shocks  for  the  water  input  are  considered  in  this  work  based  on  the  scenarios 
designed  by  Silva  (2017)  when  estimating  the  post-implementation  demand  curve  of  the  PISF 
considering  the  costs  of  transposition.  Silva  (2017)  determines  three  scenarios:  the  Baseline 
scenario  that  predicts  a  continuous  withdrawal  of  26.4  m³/s,  scenario  A2  that  predicts  an  increase 
in  average  withdrawal  flow  of 86 m³/s,  and scenario  B1 an increase  in  average  flow  to 76.5 m³/s.    

The  municipalities  of  the  sub-middle  region  downstream  from  the  Sobradinho  dam,  which  is 
likely  to  be  the  direct  source  of  water  destined  for  the  new  axes.  To  simulate  this  competition, 
two scenarios  are drawn  here  from  the Sobradinho  dam  flow.   

The  first  scenarios  for  years  that  have  more  rain  are  the  shocks:  Baseline,  A2  and  B1  on  a 
concession  of  1300  m³/s  for  the  Sobradinho  dam.  The  second  driest  scenario  considers  the  same 
shocks  for  a  concession  of  700  m³/s.  The  table  below  represents  these  shocks  to  water  supply 
over the  total  water  used in  the sub-average  São Francisco.

Table  5  presents  the  results  impact  on  the  Final  Demand,  Product  and  Employment  if  this  water 
restriction  were  only  applied  to  the  agricultural  sectors.  The  reduction  of  water  availability  to  the 
agricultural  sectors  would  cause  a  decrease  in  demand,  in  the  sense  that  there  would  be  less 
water  for crops. That  in  turn  would  also  cause  a drop in  production  and employment.

As  expected,  the  effect  on  the  production  (ΔX)  is  greater  than  the  effect  on  demand  (ΔY)  due  to 
inter-sectorial  relations.  The  effect  on  employment  (ΔEMP)  follows  the  same  logic  as  the  effect 
on  production  (ΔX),  a  fall  in  the  availability  of  water  for  agriculture  would  cause  a  decrease  in 
the  number  of  jobs for  the  agricultural  sectors.   
This  reduction  in  the  supply  of  water  also  affected  all  productive  sectors  of  the  sub-region  of  São 
Francisco,  and  not  only  to  the  agricultural  sectors.  The  effect  is  greater  on  temporary  agriculture 
than  on  permanent  agriculture,  which  is  what  requires  the  high  water  requirement  of  temporary 
crops, in  space Sugarcane. 
Table  6  presents  the  results  of  this  shock  on  the  final  demand  (ΔY),  production  (ΔX)  and  the 
employment  (ΔEMP).    The  drop  in  total  demand  for  the  São  Francisco  sub-basin  would  range 
between  R$237  million  and  R$1,434  million.  And  since  all  sectors  would  be  affected  by  the 
water  scarcity,  the  sectors  that  suffer  the  greatest  shock  on  the  final  demand  are  the  most 
important  sectors  for the  region  (Table  2): Public  Administration,  Manufacturing  and trade.   

The  same  logic  applies  to  production  and  employment.  The  fall  in  production  would  range 
between  R  $  310  million  and  R  $  1,874  million.  This  represents  a  variation  between  2%  and  12% 
on  the  total  production  in  the  region,  demonstrating  the  importance  of  water  resources.  Job 
availability  reflects  on  the  generation  of  income  and  the  well-being  of  the  population  of  the 
region  in  general.    In  the  worst  case  scenario,  a  drop  in  water  supply  could  result  in  48,198  fewer 
jobs.

The  Brazilian  government's  policy  of  expanding  irrigated  areas,  especially  in  the  Northeast  of 
Brazil,  tends  to  increase  competition  for  water  resources.  From  the  regional  input-output  matrix 
adapted  to  the  sub-river  basin  region  of  the  São  Francisco  River,  it  was  possible  to  simulate 
economic  impact  from  changes  in  water  available.  Considering  only  the  productive  sectors  with 
license  for  use,  our  study  showed  agriculture  and  livestock  to  be  the  sectors  with  the  highest 
coefficient  of  withdrawal,  but  they  would  not  be  the  only  ones  affected  by  the  reduction  of 
available  water,  as  a  result  of  the  São  Francisco  River  transposition,  for  example.  Even  if  the 
restriction  applies  only  to  the  agricultural  sectors,  the  damage  to  the  region  would  expand  to  all 
sectors.  Evaluating  the  effects  of  this  restriction  on  other  sectors  included  of  the  matrix,  the 
impact  would  be  even  greater,  reaching  12%  in  the  fall  of  production,  and  a  total  of  48,198  fewer 
jobs,  across  all  sectors.  The  scarcity  of  water  in  the  semi-arid  region  of  the  Brazilian  Northeast 
certainly  represents  a  hurdle  for  the  development  of  that  region,  but  the  transfer  of  water  from 
another  region  does  not  necessarily  mean  expansion  of  the  supply  of  water  to  the  two  regions  if 
water  is limited  and already  suffers  from  competition  between  allowed  and non-allowed  uses.
