RESUMO  

O  presente  estudo  estima  o  efeito  de  mudanças  nas  condições  econômicas  sobre  a  saúde  de  bebês 
nascidos (medido por peso ao nascer) entre 1998 e 2014 na Colômbia. Este artigo explora o aumento dos 
preços internacionais do ouro dos anos 2000 como  um  experimento  natural  que  gera choques exógenos 
para  as  economias  locais.  Usando  o  modelo  de  diferenças  em  diferenças,  verifica-se  que  o  boom 
melhorou  as  condições  de  saúde  dos  recém-nascidos.  Também  se  encontra  que  o  choque  aumentou  a 
fertilidade para as mães com menos escolaridade e diminuiu o número de consultas pré-natais (atividade 
de tempo intensivo). Posteriormente, analisa-se  o canal  do mercado de trabalho através do qual  o boom 
pôde ter afetado os resultados ao nascer e encontra-se que o choque teve  efeitos positivos significativos 
sobre  a  participação  das  mães  no  mercado  laboral.  No  geral,  destaca-se  que  o  efeito  renda  é  mais 
importante do que qualquer outro efeito oposto na procriação de crianças saudáveis.

ABSTRACT 

This paper estimates the effect of changes in economic conditions on the health of babies born (measured 
by  birth  weight)  between  1998  and  2014  in  Colombia.  We  exploit  the  2000s  surge  international  gold 
prices  as  a  natural  experiment  generating  exogenous  shocks  to  local  economies.  Using  a  difference-in-
differences  strategy,  we  document  that  the  boom  improved  the  health  status  of  newborns.  We  also  find 
that  the  shock  increased  fertility  for  less-educated  mothers  and  decreased  the  number  of  prenatal  visits 
(time-intensive  activity).  Next,  we  investigate  the  labor  market  channel  and  show  that  the  shock  had 
significant  positive  effects  on  the  labor  participation  of  mothers.  Taken  together,  we  highlight  that  the 
income effect is more important than any other opposite effect on the production of healthy children.

1.  Introduction  
 

In the  early  2000s, increases in  mineral  prices  contributed to  propel both  the mining industry  as 
economic  growth  in  many  mineral-producing  countries.  However,  the  existence  of  mineral  wealth  in  a 
developing  economy  is  usually  associated  with  negative  outcomes  as  such  corruption  and  rent  seeking, 
conflicts  and  environmental  damages,  which  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  living  conditions  of  the 
population  (VAN  DER  PLOEG,  2011;  BALAND  and  FRANCOIS,  2000).  Despite  its  relevance  in  the 
public debate and important welfare implications, there is no general agreement regarding of the effect of 
the mining sector (e.g., gold mining) on human well-being. An important topic to know is the effects of 
commodity  price  shocks  on  health  indicators  because  health  is  closely  related  to  determining  factors  of 
individual  well-being.  Examples  of  this  factors  are  the  accumulation  of  human  capital  and  labor 
productivity. 

Accordingly,  this  paper  sheds  light  on  the  effect  of  economic  conditions  on  newborns'  health  in 
Colombia  by  using  the  2000s  boom  in  international  gold  prices  as  a  natural  experiment  generating 
exogenous shocks to local economies1(municipalities in this paper). We take advantage of the persistence 
of the shock, which we can assume is exogenous due to two factors: (i) Colombia has no market power to 
influence  international  gold  prices  (Colombia  ranks  21th  in  gold  production  worldwide)  and  (ii)  gold 
mines are randomly distributed among municipalities by natural factors. We also explore how such boom 
affects  parental  behavior  in  both  health  and  labor  market  participation  as  possible  mechanisms  through 
which these effects may play out. Infants are of interest for at least two reasons.  First,  governments are 
highly motivated to  protect  these most vulnerable members of society. Second, it has been documented 
that a variety of prenatal shocks can lead to poor health at birth, which has long-lasting negative effects in 
health  and  consequently  on  economic  capabilities  (see,  for  example,  BARKER,  1995;  BEHRMAN; 
ROSENZWEIG,  2004;  CASE;  FERTIG;  PAXSON,  2005;  ALMOND,  2006;  BLACK  et  al  2007; 
BARRECA, 2010 , among other) 2. 

The  theoretical  implications  of  the  effects  of  economic  shocks  on  child  health  are  ambiguous 
because  changes  in  labor  earnings  have  both  income  and  substitution  effects.  On  the  one  hand,  higher 
wages may increase the opportunity cost of carrying out time-intensive activities. This may provide less 
incentives to allocate time devoted to children health production3. This is the substitution effect.  On the 
other  one,  higher  wages  allow  households  to  increase  the  expenditures  on  maternal  and  fetal  related 
health items. This is the income effect.  

Additionally,  gold  mining  are  associated  to  environmental  damage  (e.g.,  release  of  heavy  metal 
pollution  and  deforestation,  among  other  effects)  and  conflicts  which  could  affect  human  health4.  In 
Colombia  context,  commodity  booms  or  busts  can  affect  the  levels  of  violence  in  mining  producing 
regions. Dube and Vargas (2013) find a positive relationship between natural resource price shocks and 
violence  (measured  by  the  No.  annual  non-state  armed  groups  attack,  clashes  and  casualties,  among 
other). This fact can have effects on health indicators at birth. In fact, according to Camacho (2008) the 
exposition  to  random  landmine  explosions  during  a  woman’s  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  is  robustly 
correlated with lower birth weight. Camacho (2008) explains this impact through the relationship between 
stress in the early stages of pregnancy and outcomes at birth. In our study, unfortunately, we do not have 

                                                           
1 The gold production is distributed around the country,  with about 20% of  municipalities showing  geological prospects and 
mining activities occurring in at least 12 of Colombia’s 32 departments (MASSÉ and LE BILLON, 2017). For one department, 
Chocó, the gold represents more than 5% of GDP. In relation to Colombian exports, the gold, which is a non-traditional export, 
equaled in value to traditional exports such as ferronickel and coffee  (Ministry of Mines and Energy, 2010). 
2The proposition that health conditions at birth have a lasting impact on adult life achievements comes from the so-called “fetal 
origins hypothesis”. The first premise originated with David Barker in the 1980s. See  Barker (2001) and Almond and Currie 
(2011) for a review of the epidemiological evidence in support of this hypothesis.  
3For  example,  activities  as  practicing  good  hygiene  and  traveling  to  distant  facilities  for  free  preventive  and  primary  health 
service require time to be performed. 
4 It is estimated that artisanal gold Mining in Colombia releases 130 tons of mercury annually, which makes Colombia one of 
the countries with the highest mercury per capita rate in the world (DEHEZA and RIBET, 2012). 

 

information in our database that allows us to separately identify each of the previously mentioned effects. 
Therefore, taking advantage of the fact that these effects work in opposite directions, we estimate the net 
effect of their combined influence. Thus, our research offers evidence about relative importance of time, 
environmental  degradation  and  stress  versus  current  income  in  the  production  of  healthy  children. 
Because credit constrains and other market imperfections are more common in developing countries, we 
expect  that  our  results to  be  consistent  with  growing  evidence  that  the  income  effect  is  more  important 
other  effects  to  produce  healthy  children  (see  for  example,  BAIRD;and  COLAB.,  2011;  BURLANDO, 
2014; BOZZOLI and QUINTANA-DOMEQUE, 2014 )5. 

In  our  empirical  analysis,  we  use  a  difference-in-differences  model  which  compares  births 
outcomes  across  municipalities  whose  local  economies  have  different  degrees  of  dependence  to  gold 
production.  We  use  birth  weight  (and  other  indicators  such  as  preterm,  extreme  preterm  and  Apgar6 
(Appearance,  Pulse,  Grimace,  Activity  and  Respiration))  as  a  proxy  variable  for  initial  health 
endowments.  Specifically,  we  classify  each  child  according  to  his/her  birth  weight  in  low  birth  weight 
(LBW), which are those born with a weight less than or equal to 2500 grams, and very low birth weight 
(VLBW) that  are children with  a birth weight  of  1500 grams  or less. We  use birth weight  because it is 
determined  by  fetal  growth  rate  at  a  given  gestation  length,  which  in  turn  is  largely  influenced  by 
nutrition  (Kramer,  1987)  7.  This  feature  makes  it  an  attractive  measure  for  the  study  of  the  effects  of 
historical events that altered the in utero environment on health at birth8.  

Our results indicate a positive (negative) relationship between gold price shocks and birth weight 
(LBW  and  VLBW),  with  price  increases  inducing  an  improvement  in  child  health  conditions  among 
municipalities whose economies rely heavily on gold production. Sensitivity analyses show these results 
are  robust  to  alternative  specifications  or  standard  errors  estimates  (available  on  request)  and  the 
coefficients  do  not  suffer  large  changes  whether  controls  or  fixed  effects  are  included  or  excluded.  To 
give  more  support  to  our  finding,  we  examine  the  impact  of  the  gold  boom  on  the  distribution  of  birth 
weight. That is, we estimate the effect of gold shocks on the probability that birth weight is below a given 
threshold: 1,000; 1,500; 2,000; 2,500; 3,000 and 3,500 grams. In addition, we repeat the same procedure 
for the possibility that birth weight is above 3,500 grams. We find that there is a negative and statistically 
significant relationship between gold price shocks and birth weight below certain threshold. We find that 
the  positive  relationship  between  gold  shocks  and  health  at  birth  holds  for  the  number  of  weeks  of 
gestation  and  APGAR  score.  These  evidences  suggest  that  health-related  benefits  associated  to  the 
income  effect  during  booming  periods  prevail  over  the  potential  negative  impacts  represented  by  the 
substitution effect and the negative environmental externalities from the increasing mining production.  

Our findings are in line with Aragón and Rud (2013), who highlight the dominance of the income 
effect in the case of the Peruvian economy. They studied the effect of the expansion of the largest gold 
mine  in  Peru  on  local  living  standards  using  households’  survey  data  for  the  period  1997  to  2006.  The 
authors  found  that  the  expansion  of  the  mine  has  a  positive  impact  on  nominal  and  real  income  of  the 
local population. They argue that a possible channel of transmission through which these effects emerge 
is the existence of backward linkages. To try to verify whether this is true for the case of Colombia, we 
present an exploratory analysis of the relationship between the proportion of mothers with a contributory 
regime  and  the  boom  in  gold  world  price.  This  type  of  social  protection,  according  to  the  Colombia’ 
Ministry of Health, is mandatory for formal workers and other people with the capacity to pay. While the 

                                                           
5 Constraints on savings and borrowing weigh not only on households’ consumption smoothing but also on their ability to pay 
for basic investments in their children. 
6 Apgar score is a composite index of a child’s health at the first and fifth minute of birth. It takes into account factors: activity 
and muscle tone, heart rate, grimace, skin coloration, and respiration. Each of this factors is worth 2 points. 
7Medical literature has established a strong link between low birth weight and health problems such as cerebral palsy, deafness, 
epilepsy, blindness, asthma, and lung disease (BROOKS et al., 2001; KAELBER; PUGH, 1969; LUCAS; MORLEY; COLE, 
1998;  MATTE  et  al.,  2001;  NELSON;  GRETHER,  1997;  PANETH,  1995).  Low  birth  weight  has  been  also  shown  to  be  a 
strong predictor of impaired development of the brain. Children born with very low birth weight are more likely to suffer from 
attention deficit, dyspraxia, and impaired learning (MARLOW et al, 1989; 1993). 
8 In this point, what becomes relevant is to understand the malleability of health at birth. Today it is not difficult to think that 
the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drug cause intrauterine  growth retardation, or that good nutrition and better 
access to medical care have positive effects on fetal health (Currie, 2011). 

other  regime,  subsidized,  is  for  the  unemployed,  informal  sector  workers  and  the  poor.  Therefore, 
knowing if the mother is affiliated or not to the contributory regime is a good proxy to have information 
about  their  labor  participation.  We  find  a  positive  relationship  between  these  two  variables  which 
suggests  that  the  gold  boom  generated  a  positive  effect  on  mothers’  labor  participation.  This  result 
reinforces the idea that the income effect is greater in magnitude than any other opposite effect 

Our  study  makes  a  few  contributions  to  literature  examining  the  effects  of  economic  shocks  on 
children health. First, although there is a rich theoretical literature that suggest that countries and regions 
with  an  abundance  of  natural  resources  fail  to  provide  better  standards  of  living(SACHS;  WARNER, 
1999; MEHLUM et al, 2006, among others), our results show, at least in the short term, the gold boom 
had  a  positive  impact  on  the  living  standards  of  the  local  population  and  improved  the  children  health. 
Second,  we  see  our  empirical  work  as  a  first  attempt  to  examine  the  effects  of  the  abundance  of  gold 
within a country on birth outcomes of the cohorts affected by the gold boom. This is a contribution to a 
literature  that  emphasizes  the  long-lasting  effects  of  the  fetal  exposure  to  economic  shocks  or  health 
insults  on an individual’s economic well-being (see, for example,  ALMOND, 2006; OREOPOULOS  et 
al.,  2008;  BARRECA,  2010).  Third, as  will  be  seen  later,  our  work  also  contributes  to  literature  on 
fertility.  Specifically,  our  empirical  evidence  that  the  gold  boom  led  to  increases  to  fertility  for 
disadvantaged  women  (low-educated  women)  is  consistent  with  life-cycle  models  in  which  credit 
constraints and skill depreciation during pregnancy are important in fertility decisions.  

Finally,  we  also  highlight  the  importance  of  prenatal  interventions  as  a  mechanism  to  reduce 
disparities in the accumulation of human capital in the long-run. This is of particular interest in view of 
the growing evidence indicating that interventions focused on the prenatal period are more effective and 
substantially less expensive to be implemented (DOYLE  et al.,  2009). This is especially important in the 
context of Colombia because current policies are focused on the population over six years old. 

The  remainder  of  this  paper  proceeds  as  follows.  Section  2  describes  our  micro  data  and  the 
identification  strategies.  Section  3  contains  our  main  results.  In  Section  4,  we  present  some  robustness 
check.  Section  5  provides  a  possible  exploring  market  channel  through  which  the  gold  boom  impacts 
birth weight. Finally, section 5 presents conclusions. 

 

2. Data and Identification strategy 

2.1 Data  

2.1.1 Vital Statistics Records 
 

The  main  source  of  data  for  this  study  is  the  vital  statistics  of  Colombia,  Estadísticas  Vitales  – 
EEVV-,  which  is  collected  by  the  Administrative  Department  of  Statistics  (DANE)  each  year  as  from 
1998.  The  EEVV  correspond  to  the  birth  certificates  filled  out  by  hospitals  after  delivery.  The  data  not 
only  register  the  health  status  of  newborn,  but  also  contain  information  on  the  characteristics  of  the 
parents including age, marital status and education, type of insurance. In addition to this information, the 
birth certificate allows us to observe the behavior of the mother during pregnancy, as it contains details 
about prenatal care. We obtained data from1998 to 2014 for the 1120 municipalities in Colombia, which 
corresponds- approximately to 11 million birth records. An advantage of this data is that weight, length, 
Apgar score, and gestation time recorded at the time of the delivery in the hospital should be accurately 
measured  variables.  The  sample  is  limited  to  births  that  were  certified  by  a  physician,  which  implies  a 
reduction of about 6% in the number of observations. We have also disconsidered births that occurred in 
municipalities  in  which  we  have  no  information  on  the  levels  of  production  of  gold.  Thus,  the  final 
sample  of  our  study  consists  of  about  5,152,269  births.  We  aggregate  the  data  into  cells  defined  by 
municipality of residence of the mother, year and months of birth, and gender of the baby. 

The Table 1 shows a statistical summary of natality data. The prevalence of LBW in Colombia is 
on  the  order  of  6.28%.  Almost  0.58%  of  infants  had  VLBW.  About  13%  of  the  births  in  the  analysis 
period  had  a  weight  above  3500  gr.  The  average  of  5  minute  Apgar  score  is  5.99.  Of  all  infants  born 
51.28% were male. As for preterm deliveries, 13.11% of babies were born before week 37 and 0.23% of 
them were born before week 28. Regarding the characteristics of mothers, approximately 40.70% of them 

had a primary education level or less (<5 years of schooling). Also, 25.63% of mothers are under 19 years 
of  age,  19.21%  were  married.  Finally,  the  average  number  of  prenatal  visits  is  around  5  visits.  At  least 
50.85% of mothers in our sample had 5 or fewer prenatal visits. 

 

2.1.2 International gold price  

We use the World Bank’s commodities prices series, which offers monthly price information for 
different commodities (such as coffee, oil and coal, to name but a few) from 1960 to the present. Figure 1 
shows the evolution of average annual of gold world prices for the period 1900 to 2014. We can observe 
that the trend of prices  was approximately stable between 1990  and 2001 and it increased continuously 
from 2002 to 2012. This trend provides us a natural experiment from which we can analyze the effect of 
gold mining on birth outcomes. We use the average of the natural log of the international gold price in the 
12 months prior to birth in year y and month t for the construction of our main independent variable.  

2.1.3 Local gold production 

 
   
We  rely  on  two  data  sources  to  construct  time  series  of  the  local  gold  production.  First,  we  use 
gold  production data provided by  Dube  and Vargas (2013) . This  dataset  includes information  on  other 
commodities,  such  as  coffee,  oil  and  coal.  This  information  is  useful  not  only  for  the  analysis  of  gold 
boom, but also to make a series of robustness checks, which will support our empirical result. Second, we 
use the gold  production data from  The System of Mining  Information of Colombia as a complement to 
avoid  losses  of  municipalities  that  do  not  have  records  in  the  database  of  Dube  and  Vargas  (2013). 
However,  due  to  missing  data  in  the  gold  production  databases,  we  can  only  recover  information  from 
990  municipalities,  which  is  equivalent  to  88%  of  the  total  municipalities  in  Colombia.  Figure  2  and  3 
show  the  cross-sectional  variation  of  gold  production  in  2004  across  different  areas  of  Colombia.  In 
Figure 2, we can observe that the distribution of production varies substantially across the municipalities 
that  are  at  or  above  the  75th  percentile.  In  this  part  of  the  distribution,  the  maximum  production  was 
34.11 thousand grams, which was 33.56 thousand grams greater than the production of the municipality 
that  produced  the  least  (0.54  thousand  grams).  Additionally,  the  standard  deviation  in  gold  production 
across of these municipalities is around 10 thousand grams. As a result of this variation, as we shall see, 
different areas experienced differential changes in child health in response to changing gold world prices. 
This is the basis of our empirical strategy.

2.2 Identification strategy  
 

The estimation of the causal effect of income variations on birth outcomes raise some endogeneity 
issues,  since  some  determinants  of  health  at  birth  are  unobservable  to  the  econometrician.  A  family's 
unobserved characteristics, for instance, might  be correlated with  family  income as well as with health-
related  expenditures.  This  situation  could  lead  to  a  classic  case  of  failed  inference.  To  avoid  these 
identification problems, it is necessary to find an exogenous source of income variation. In the absence of 
a randomized controlled trial (for example, to assign randomly individuals different levels of permanent 
income),  we  exploit  the  2000s  boom  in  international  gold  prices  as  a  natural  experiment  generating 
exogenous  shocks  to  local  economies.  This  variable  is  a  proxy  to  measure  the  gold  boom  in  each 
municipality.  The  assumption  here  is  that  variations  in  the  world  gold  prices  are  exogenous  to  local 
conditions in producing municipalities in Colombia. This assumption is not unrealistic since Colombia is 
not among the main gold producers in the world and therefore the country may be considered a price taker 
in the international gold market (Colombia ranks 21th in gold production worldwide). 

One  should  note  that  the  world  price  of  gold  is  invariant  across  regions.  This  invariance  would 
leave  the  analysis  without  an  adequate  control  group  to  measure  the  effect  on  birth  outcomes,  since  all 
municipalities  would  be  exposed  to  the  same  price  variation.  Our  empirical  strategy  exploits  the 
interaction between global gold prices and municipality gold production capabilities as treatment variable. 
Because the mother’s nutritional status at the time of conception could also be an important predictor of 
child’s initial health endowment, we use the average of gold prices in the 12-month period before birth to 
take into account that effect pre-pregnancy. Accordingly, to all the above considerations, our econometric 
strategy follows a difference-in-differences estimator by assessing whether changes in gold prices affect 
birth  outcomes  disproportionately  in  municipalities  that  produce  more  of  this  commodity.  In  this 
approach,  time  variation  stems  from  movements  in  prices.  Put  differently,  we  estimate  how  health 
indicators at birth vary in a way that is proportionate to both (i) the average of gold prices in the 12-month 
period  before  birth  (ii)  the  economic  importance  of  gold  in  one’s  birth  municipality  (defined  as 
production  level  of  gold).  Our  specific  measure  of  the  impact  of  gold  price  utilizes  both  sources  of 
variation simultaneously. We define non-producing municipalities as those with production equal to zero 
and  producing  municipalities  as  those  with  positive  production.  As  previously  seen,  the  level  of  gold 
production varies between producing municipalities. Thus, this strategy can be considered as a difference 

in difference model with intensity in the treatment9. This analysis is based on a municipality-by month of 
birth panel. So, the benchmark regression is the following: 
 

𝐻𝑚𝑑𝑔𝑦𝑡 = 𝛼 +  𝛽(𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚𝑑 × 𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣12𝑡𝑦)+𝛿′𝑋𝑚𝑑𝑔𝑦𝑡+ 𝜂𝑚𝑡 + 𝛾𝑦𝑡 + 𝜂𝑑 × 𝑦 + 𝜖𝑚𝑑𝑔𝑦𝑡            (1)  

here  the  left-hand-side  variable,  𝐻𝑚𝑑𝑔𝑦𝑡  ,is  a  measure  of  health  outcome  (average)  for  infants  born  in 
municipality m , department 𝑑 and with gender 𝑔 (male or female) , on year y and month t (with t = 1, 2, 
…,  12).  Our  key  dependent  variables  (𝐻𝑚𝑑𝑔𝑦𝑡)  are  low  and  very  low  birth  weight,  but  we  also  look  at 
other  health  outcomes  such  as  length  of  gestation,  and  APGAR  score.  𝑋𝑚𝑑𝑦𝑡  is  a  vector  that  contains 
mother-specific  controls  such  as  age,  educational  attainment,  and  marital  status  (municipality  average). 
(𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚𝑑  is  the  gold  production  level  in  municipality  m  and    the  department  d  during  2004  and 
𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣12𝑡𝑦 denotes the average of the natural log of the international gold price in the 12 months prior 
to  birth  in  year  y  and  month  t10.  𝜂𝑚𝑡  is  a  set  of  municipality-by-month  fixed  effects,  which  take  into 
account  the  possibility  that  any  time-invariant  differences  between  municipalities  (like  Geographical-
Features) may be correlated with (𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚𝑑   ×   𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣12𝑡𝑦)and 𝐻𝑚𝑑𝑔𝑦𝑡.  

The  𝛾𝑦𝑡 is  a  set  of  year-by-month  fixed  effects,  which  captures  unobserved  aggregate  shocks 
impacting  the  entire  country  and  secular  trends  in  health  outcomes  at  birth.  To  address  potential 
unobserved  long-run  differences  in  improving  public  health  and  other  socioeconomic  characteristics 
across  department,  department-specific  linear  time  trends  ( 𝜂𝑑 × 𝑦)  are  included  in  our  benchmark 
specification.  This  linear  time  trend  is  common  to  all  municipalities  included  in  a  given  department 
(average of 38 municipalities per department). Further, all our models use robust standard errors adjusted 
for clustering at the municipality-month level to account for serial correlation (BERTRAND et al.,  2004). 
We weight observations by the number of births, which has two purposes: First, it emulates a regression 
at  the  individual  level.  Second,  the  weighted  regression  may  control  for  the  fact  that  smaller 
municipalities  can  generate  some  noise  in  the  analysis  due  to  lower-quality  data  collection.  Thus, 
variations of smaller areas are given a lower weight. 

Finally,  the  identifying  assumption  of  our statistical  approach  can  be  summarized  in  three  parts: 
First, the world price of gold is exogenous to local conditions in Colombian municipalities, i.e., it is not 
affected  by  Colombia’s  gold  production.  Second,  we  exploit  the  fact  that  this  natural  resource  is  not 
evenly distributed across the country (the distribution depend on natural factors), which produces a totally 
random assignment of the effect of a boom or bust associated to  gold prices. Third, in the absence of a 
boom or bust in international  gold  price, municipalities in  the treatment and control groups would have 
experienced the same trends in the outcome of interest (𝐻𝑚𝑑𝑦𝑡). This assumption would be violated only 
if  there  were  differential  trends  in  time-varying  determinants  of  outcomes  across  treated  and  untreated 
areas.  For  example,  if  poorer  municipalities  were  converging  to  richer  ones  in  terms  of  income  or  any 
other potential determinant  of infant  health, then it may  lead to  overestimates of the effects  of the  gold 
boom on infant health. To provide an assessment on the validity of this assumption in our context, Figure 
4 shows the difference  in the temporal  trend in  the rate of newborns with low birth weight between the 
two types of municipalities (producer and non-producer)11. In this figure is observed that before 2004 the 
rate  of  children  with  LBW  evolved  relatively  similar  between  the  two  groups  and  only  after  that  year 
different  tendencies  were  visualized.  This  observation  would  give  meaning  to  the  application  of  our 
difference-in-differences setup.      

 
              

                                                           
9  This  type  of  methodology  has  been  widely  used  in  recent  studies  (  See,  for  instant,  Dube  and  Vargas  (2013),  Miller  and 
Urdinola (2010) and Acemoglu et al ( 2013)). 
10We measure prices in logs so we can assess its effects in percent terms.  The results are robust when prices are specified in 
levels. 
11 In this figure, we define as a non-producing municipality those with gold production equal to zero and producing 
municipalities as those with gold production in the 95th percentile or above it.

4.  Empirical results 
 
4.1 Main results 
 

Table  2  presents  the  main  empirical  results.  The  results  are  obtained  using  OLS  regression  of 
LBW and VLBW on our measure of prenatal gold shocks controlling for different regressors (from 1998 
to  2014).  In  our  most  basic  specification  presented  in  the  first  column,  we  regressed  our  child  health 
measure on  a set  of  controls, which includes month-by-year, municipality  and  year fixed effects.  In the 
remaining  columns  we  add  to  the  firth  specification  other  control  variables  as  follows:  Column  2  with 
municipality-by-month  fixed  effects,  column  3  with  mothers’  characteristics  and  newborns’  sex,  and 
column 4 with department specific linear time trends.  

Overall, the coefficients in columns (1)–(4) seem to suggest that gold price shocks have a positive 
relationship  with  infant  health,  that  is  to  say:  when  international  gold  price  increases,  health  at  birth 
improves differentially in municipalities that produce gold more intensively. In all the specifications the 
coefficient  of  interest  𝛽  suggest  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  the  incidence  of  LBW  caused  by 
exposure to gold boom during twelve months prior birth. It is notable that our results are extremely robust 
across specifications, including for department-specific linear time trends and mother's characteristics. To 
understand the magnitude of the estimated, consider an increase in PGoldav12ty of 0.20 log points and the 
coefficient estimated in column (4), which is  our specification base. For the average gold  production in 
producing  municipalities,  which  is  2.335  (hundred  thousand  grams),  the  coefficients  imply  that  the 
increase  in  prices  induced  -0.02  less  newborn babies  with  LBW,  relative  to  the  non-producing 
municipalities.  Now  when  this  effect  is  divided  by  mean  of  LBW  rate,  the  resulting  effect  size  is  a 
decrease of -0.30% in the prevalence of LBW in producing municipalities relative to non-producers. We 
labeled  in  this  and  subsequent  tables  as  ‘‘%  Impact  ([coef*∆  log  price*    𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑̅̅̅̅̅̅]/mean)’’.  This  impact  is 
greater for municipalities with production levels greater than 𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑̅̅̅̅̅̅. 

This effect estimated of -0.30% that we uncover for the boom in gold world price is almost three 
times smaller in absolute value than the -1.02% reduction in the cases of  LBW due to the introduction of 
the  Food  Stamp  Program  (FSP)  in  United  States  estimated  by  Almond,  Hoynes  and    Schanzenbach 
(2011). Moreover, our estimated impact  for  LBW is a little lower than  -0.50% reduction in  babies with 
LBW explained by a 1% increase in the unemployment rate in the US labor market (see DEHEJIA et al, 
2004).  Comparing  the  coefficient  found  in  our  work  (which  is  -0.04074)  in  relation  to  that  found  by 
Bozzoli  and  Quintana-Domeque  (2014)  for  the  Argentine  economic  collapse  is  0.026  lower  in  absolute 

value  than  the  -0.067  calculated  by  them.  These  comparisons  suggest  that  our  estimates  are  not  so  far 
from what has already been found in empirical studies analyzing economic shocks in the pregnancy stage. 
We obtain similar results when applying the same estimation procedure for VLBW. Specifically, 
from column (1) through (4) in panel B of the Table 2, we observe a significantly negative coefficient of 
effect of the gold boom on the rate of VLBW. These results are also very robust to the addition of more 
control  variables  to  the  model.  As  in  panel  A,  we  calculate  the  impact,  evaluated  in  the  average  gold 
municipality, in percentage terms of an increase of 0.20 log points in 𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣12𝑡𝑦,the resulting effect size 
is between -0.68 % and -0.71 % of reduction in cases of very low birth weight in producing municipalities 
relative to non-producers. In general, in Table 2, we view the specification with department specific linear 
time trends as very encouraging, because we have addressed a potential concern regarding the possibility 
of that our estimator is driven by common omitted factors correlated both with 𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚𝑑   ×   𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣12𝑡𝑦 
and health at birth. 

Now, we examine the impact of the gold boom on the distribution of birth weight. That is, we use 
specification  (4)  to  estimate  the  effect  of  gold  shocks  on  the  probability  that  birth  weight  is  below  a 
certain  threshold:  1,000;  1,500;  2,000;  2,500;  3,000  and  3,500  grams.  In  addition,  we  repeat  the  same 
procedure for the possibility that birth weight is above 3,500 grams. Results are presented in Table 3. On 
the  one  hand,  we  find  that  there  is  a  negative  and  statistically  significant-  with  the  exception  of  birth 
weight  below  3500  grams-  correlation  between  gold  price  shocks  and  birth  weight  below  certain 
threshold.  Note  that  the  largest  reductions  are  obtained  at  the  lower  thresholds-  1,000  to  2,000-.  The 
observed  impact  becomes  gradually  smaller  as  the  threshold  increases,  until  the  point  where  gold  price 
shocks  do  not  generate  effects  on  births  below  3500.On  the  other  hand,  the  last  column  shows  that  an 
increase  of  0.20  log  points  in  the  international  gold  prices  is  associated  with  a  0.43%  increase  in  the 
incidence of the birth weight above 3,500 grams in the average gold producing municipality. 

In  general,  our  estimates  unveil  a  clear  pattern:  they  show  a  positive  relationship  between  gold 
price  shocks  and  health  at  birth  measured  by  birth  weight,  with  price  increases  inducing  a  differential 
improved  in  child  health  among  municipalities  that  exploit  more  this  natural  resource.  Sensitivity 
analyses  show  that these  results  are  robust  to  alternative  specifications  or  standard  errors  estimates  (see 
appendix  B),  and  the  coefficients  do  not  suffer  large  changes  whether  controls  or  fixed  effects  are 
included or excluded.   

Taken together, this pattern of results seems  to  suggest that income shocks are a more powerful 
determinant  of  health  at  birth  than  the  joint  effect  of  the  opportunity  cost  of  time,  environmental 
degradation  and  stress  to  produce  healthy  children.  However,  due  to  the  level  of  aggregation  of  the 
analysis, we cannot rule out that the main result may be driven by changes in the composition of births, 
composition  of  parturients  (fertility  decisions)  and  the  health-related  behavior  of  pregnant  women.  To 
address  these  possible  channels,  we  test  for  impacts  of  the  gold  shocks  on  total  births,  mothers' 
demographic  characteristics  and  parental  behaviors  related-health.  These  results  are  presented  in  the 
following subsections.

4.2 Other newborn outcomes 
 

We  next  explore  whether  the  gold  boom  improves  other  health  measures  in  addition  to  birth 
weight.  Results  are  presented  in  Table  4.  To  carry  out  this  analysis,  we  use  the  same  specification  of 
equation (1). The analysis is undertaken with the following birth health measures: the rate of premature 
babies  (less  than  37  weeks’  gestation),  rate  of  extreme  prematurity  (less  than  28  weeks’  gestation)  and 
low 5 minutes APGAR (Apgar score < 8). In panel A we show the results for the fraction of prematurity 
with  different  specifications.  We  can  observe  that  coefficient  is  significantly  negative  and  robust  to  the 
inclusion  of  additional  controls.  Similar  results  we  obtained  for  all  other  birth  outcomes.  Overall,  the 
results show an improvement in health indicators at birth.

Notes:  The dependent variable is the fraction of children born - by sex, municipality, month and year The effect of a 20% increase in gold 
prices are computed by multiplying the average production of gold- producing municipalities by the coefficient on Gold production2004 x 
gold price, and dividing the resulting value by the mean of dependent variable. “Other controls” include the newborn's sex, mother’s school 
attainment,  maternal  age  and  mother's  marital  status.  Estimates  are  weighted  using  the  number  of  birth.  Robust  standard  errors  are  in 
parentheses and are clustered at the municipality-months level. Significance: ∗ p < 0.10 ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01. 
 
 
5.  Robustness check 
 

In this subsection we present  a number of  robustness  tests  designed to  assess the validity of our 
identification strategy. Specifically, we explore whether our findings are influenced by inclusion of other 
commodities (coal, coffee and oil), changes in mother behavior and changes in the composition of births 
or parturients. In general, the results from these robustness checks are reassuring.  
  
5.1 Mother Characteristics 

 

The gold  boom  can lead to  increase in  fertility  for women with  low educational  level  and credit 
restrictions against those women who have a better economic status.  This  change in  the composition of 
the  sample  could  bias  downward  our  estimator.  Table  5  presents  the  results  for  mothers  with  primary 
education or less, mothers with high school incomplete or less, mothers with high school and mother with 
college  or  more.  The  coefficients  in  columns  (1)  and  (2)  show  that  gold  price  shocks  have  a  positive 
relationship with the proportion of mothers with low socioeconomic status (SES):  when the price of gold 
increases,  babies  born 
in 
municipalities that produce gold more intensively.  

low-SES  (low-educated  women)  mothers 

increase  differentially 

to 

This  pattern  in  mothers’  education  distribution  support  the  hypothesis  of  that  low-SES  mothers 
who are more likely to  face credit constraints will tend be more fertile than high-SES women when the 
economy experiences positive macroeconomic shocks (see, for example, DEHEJIA et al, 2004). Overall, 
we consider the estimates in Table 5 are encouraging because they suggest that our main results (Table 2) 
are biased downwards by endogenous sample selection, which means that the effects of gold shocks on 
health at birth is greater than estimated.

5.2 Behavioral changes 
 

We next study the cyclicality of time-intensive child health investments. In addition to changes in 
the  composition  of  parturients,  gold  price  shocks  could  also  encourage  behaviors  that  could  harm  or 
improve infant health. In Table 6, we present the results of this empirical exercise. To obtain these results, 
we  use  the  specification  of  equation  (1).  According  to  the  existing  empirical  literature;  we  also  find  a 
countercyclical relationship between prenatal care visits and the gold boom. From column (1) to (3), we 
observe  a  significant  deterioration  in  the  use  of  the  prenatal  care  service  among  mothers:    the  average 
number  of  prenatal  care  visits  decreases,  the  proportion  of  mothers  with  less  than  5  prenatal  care  visits 
increases,  and  the  proportion  of  mothers  with  more  than  7  prenatal  care  visits  decreases.  This  result  is 
consistent  with  the  fact  that  time-intensive  activities  decrease  as  a  result  of  a  positive  shock  in  the 
economy (DEHEJIA; LLERAS-MUNEY, 2004). Additionally, this result supports our hypothesis that the 
income  effect,  in  the  case  of  gold,  is  more  important  than  other  factors  in  the  production  of  healthy 
children.

and  (3),  The  dependent  variable is  the  fraction  of  children  born  -  by  sex,  municipality,  month  and  year.  Estimates  are  weighted  using  the 
number of birth. Robust standard errors are in parentheses and are clustered at the  municipality-months.Significance : ∗ p < 0.10 ∗∗ p < 0.05, 
∗∗∗ p <0.01 
 

5.3 Composition of births 

 
Another  potential  concern  that  could  arise  is  that  gold  shocks  may  generate,  through  selective 
mortality,  gradual  changes  in  the  composition  of  birth  cohorts.  Put  differently,  babies  born  during  the 
gold boom may be different, for example in terms of health, from what would otherwise they have been. 
This  empirical  analysis  is  presented  in  the  Table  7.  The  finding  in  column  (1)  suggests  that  gold  price 
shocks have a procyclical relationship with the total number of births: when the price of gold increases, 
the  total  number  of  babies  increases  differentially  in  municipalities  that  produce  gold  more  intensively. 
Overall, this result is reassuring, because the increase in total births could be interpreted as indicative of 
the improvement in survivability of marginal fetuses, which would lead to a negative composition effect 
on  child  health.  That  is  to  say,  this  change  in  composition  of  births  leads  to  a  bias  downward  in  the 
estimated effect of the gold boom on health outcome at birth.

5.4 Other commodity and child health  

 

Another potential problem pervading our analysis concerns to the possibility existence of spillover 
effects in municipalities that are also producers of other commodities or are close to other municipalities 
that produce these commodities.  To address this concern, we use data from production levels of oil and 
coal, and hectares cultivated coffee for the years 1988, 2004 and 1997,  respectively. Based on this data, 
𝑟 ×
we  estimate  a  broader  specification  of  our  base  model  (Equation  1)  adding  the  term  𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑚𝑑
𝛾𝑦𝑡 for each commodity which is an interaction between the production (or cultivated area) and year-by-
month  fixed.  In  this  specification,  we  consider  some  possible  contemporary  booms  or  busts  to  gold  in 
other  commodities,  which  could  drive  our  estimator  of  the  impact  of  gold  shocks  on  early  health 
outcomes. 

Table 8 shows the results to this exercise. The column (1) is our benchmark specification, which 
we  use  to  compare  it  with  the  other  specifications.  In  columns  (2)  to  (3)  we  look  whether  the  main 
estimator changes in magnitude and significance when we control for oil production, coal production and 

coffee  hectares.  Note  that  the  results  for  LBW  and  LVBW  are  reasonably  robust  across  the  alternative 
specifications.  Indeed,  when  we  include  all  three  commodities  in  the  same  specification,  our  finding 
remains  unchanged  in  both  the  level  of  statistical  significance  and  the  magnitude  of  the  effect.  These 
results  reduce  concerns  that  the  improvement  in  health  at  birth  may  be  due  to  price  variations  in  other 
commodities than gold.

6.  Exploring market channel 
 

We  next  study  whether  the  surge  in  gold  world  prices  propelled  economic  activity  in  the 
municipalities that produce this precious metal. The literature on the curse of natural resources points out 
that  the  abundance  of  natural  resources  would  fail  to  provide  a  better  quality  of  life  for  the  population, 
and in particular, under the context of poor quality institutions and bad governance. However, the debate 
is still open. A recent contribution by Aragón and Rud ( 2013) studied the effect of the expansion of the 
largest gold mine in Peru on local living standards using households’ survey data for the period 1997 to 
2006. The authors found that the expansion of the mine has a positive impact on nominal and real income 
of  the  local  population.  They  argue  that  a  possible  channel  of  transmission  through  which  these  effects 
emerge is the existence of backward linkages.  

Given our limited information  on the labor market,  we will try to  verify whether the increase in 
international gold prices has led to changes in the labor participation rate of mothers in the gold producing 
municipalities.  For  this  purpose,  we  will  use  information  regarding  the  type  of  mother’s  social  security 
regime  in  health.  In  particular,  we  estimate  the  relationship  between  the  proportion  of  mothers  with  a 
contributory  regime  and  our  main  dependent  variable.  This  type  of  social  protection,  according  to  the 
Colombia’ Ministry of Health, is mandatory for formal workers and other people with the capacity to pay. 

While  the  other  regime,  subsidized,  is  for  the  unemployed,  informal  sector  workers  and  the  poor. 
Therefore, knowing if the mother is affiliated or not to the contributory regime is  a good proxy to have 
information  about  their  labor  participation.  Table  9  presents  the  results  for  this  exercise.  In  this 
specification,  we  restricted  the  sample  to  municipalities  with  gold  production  in  2004.  Note  that  in  all 
cases,  the  estimates  of  are  significantly  positive  and  robust  to  the  inclusion  of  additional  controls.  This 
result reinforces the idea that the income effect is greater in magnitude than any other opposite effect.

7.  Final remark 
 

 

 

 

This  paper  exploits  the  local  economic  shocks  induced  by  the  2000s  surge  international  gold 
prices  to  provide  credible  estimates  of  the  effect  of  economic  conditions  on  infant  health  in  the 
Colombian  context.  We  take  advantage  of  the  persistence  of  the  shock,  which  we  can  assume  is 
exogenous  due  to  two  factors:  (i)  Colombia  has  no  market  power  to  influence  international  gold  prices 
(Colombia ranks 21th in gold production worldwide) and (ii) gold mines are randomly distributed among 
municipalities by natural factors. Using information of around 11 million births between 1998 and 2014, 
we have found that the prenatal exposure to gold boom improved the initial health endowments.  

Because the type of women who have children in positive business cycles may differ from those 
who choose to postpone fertility, we check whether the shock of gold led to changes in the composition 
of parturients. Knowing this is important since parental characteristics are correlated to the health status 
of children and therefore, a change in  the selective timing of conceptions can lead to differences  in  the 
birth outcomes during the economic cycle. In this analysis, we find that less-educated mothers are more 
likely  to  have  children  during  gold  boom,  thus  decreasing  the  average  health  status  of  their  babies.  In 
contrast, we observed that high-educated mothers choose to postpone fertility. In addition, the gold boom 
may  lead  to  change  in  mothers'  health-related  behaviors.  We  find  evidence  that  gold  price  shock  had  a 
negative effect on prenatal care visits, which would lead to a decrease in children's health. 

Overall, our results can be interpreted as follows: fetal exposure to the boom in international gold 
price led to improve in initial health endowments differentially in areas that produce more gold, even with 
negative  effects  such  as  the  increase  in  the  proportion  of  low-SES  mothers,  decrease  in  the  number  of 
prenatal  visits  and  the  degradation  of  the  environment.  This  suggests  that,  given  that  women’s  health 
behavior  worsens  with  gold  boom  and  that  incomes  are  higher  in  this  cycle,  it  would  seem  that  the 
income effect is an important determinant of health at birth. Our main results are compatible with those 
obtained by Bozzoli and Quintana-Domeque (2014) and Burlando (2014) ,who found a net negative effect 

on health at  the birth of the Argentine  macroeconomic collapse between 2001 and 2002 and an electric 
blackout in Tanzania, respectively. 

Regarding  possible  mechanisms,  we  analyze  the  relationship  between  main  dependent  variable 
and the proportion of women with a contributory health regime, which covers formal workers and other 
people  with  the  capacity  to  pay.  We  find  a  positive  relationship  between  these  variables.  This  suggests 
that  the  shock  may  have  generated  an  increase  in  the  real  income  of  the  locating  households  in  the 
producing municipalities, which led to an improvement in the health of both the mother and the newborn. 
This  result  reinforces  the  idea  that  the  income  effect  is  greater  in  magnitude  than  any  other  opposite 
effect. 

There  are  certain  limitations  of  this  study  that  must  be  acknowledged.  Probably  the  most 
important one is the absence of information on direct measures of mothers' labor market outcomes which 
prevents  us  from  obtaining  accurate  estimates  of  the  labor  market  mechanism.  However,  our  findings 
represent an advance in understanding the impact of changes in economic conditions on children’s health, 
which is important for policy formulations that aim to reduce economic inequality among individuals.

APPENDIX  

Postnatal gold fluctuation 

At this point, a possible problem with our estimation strategy would arise if the prevalence of LBW and 
VLBW are correlated  with  postnatal gold  fluctuations (one to  nine months after birth). We address this 
concern  estimating  our  base  specification  (4)  by  controlling,  in  addition  to PGoldav12ty,  for  the  average 
logarithm of the world gold price in the nine months after birth. Specifically, we estimate the following 
model: 

𝐻𝑚𝑑𝑦𝑡 = 𝛼 +  𝛽(𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚𝑑 × 𝐵𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣12𝑡𝑦) +𝜎(𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚𝑑 × 𝐹𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣9𝑡𝑦) + 𝛿′𝑋𝑚𝑑𝑦𝑡 +    𝜂𝑚𝑡 + 𝛾𝑦𝑡 +  𝜂𝑑 × 𝑦 +
𝜇𝑚𝑑𝑦𝑡     (2)   

 
where    FPGoldav9ty  is  the  log-average  of  world  gold  price    in  the  12  months  after  to  birth  for  a  birth 
occurring in month t in year y and 𝜇𝑚𝑑𝑦𝑡  is  a random error term. The remaining controls are those used 
in  our base specification (equation 4). Hmdyt is  a  measure of health outcome (municipality average) for 
children born in municipality m, on year y and month t. In this specification, the standard errors are also 
clustered at municipality-month level. 𝜎 reflects the sensitivity of health at birth to postnatal fluctuations 
in our measure of gold intensity. 

Columns 1 and 2 in Table 1 in this appendix show the results of these robustness checks. In the cases of 
column (2), the main coefficient (β) is similar to estimated in the baseline regression -column (1)-. Note 
that the interaction of gold production by municipalities indexed in 2004 with the average of the natural 
log of the international is insignificant, while the interaction with log-average of world gold price in the 
12 months before to birth remains negative, with little change in magnitude and significant. This finding 
reduces concerns that the baseline results reflect some anticipated effect of gold shocks. Indeed, we can 
take this result as a falsification test for our empirical strategy.
