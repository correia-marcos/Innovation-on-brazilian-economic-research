Abstract 
This article explores some key aspects of the debate about the potential efficacy of a fiscal rule that sets a government 
expenditure ceiling for the stabilisation of the public debt-to-output ratio. We develop a demand-led macromodel that 
assumes a closed economy operating with excess  productive capacity and show that a fiscal rule that sets a limit for 
government spending, excluding the payment of interests, may not ensure a non-explosive trajectory of the public debt-
to-output  ratio.  Our  model  allows  us  to  map  out  different  outcomes  in  terms  of  the  stabilisation  of  the  public  debt 
stemming from the process of fiscal consolidation and conclude that the commitment of the fiscal authority to comply 
with the ceiling by cutting government spending is less likely to stabilise the public debt-to-output ratio in economies 
enduring excessively high interest rates accompanied by more regressive taxation systems. Our model also suggests that 
a more progressive tax structure may often increase the chances of achieving public debt stabilisation in the long run.

Resumo 
Este artigo explora alguns aspectos-chave do debate sobre a eficácia de uma regra fiscal que define um teto de gastos do 
governo para a estabilização da relação dívida pública como proporção do produto. Desenvolvemos um modelo formal 
para  uma  economia  fechada  operando  com  excesso  de  capacidade  instalada  e  mostramos  que  uma  regra  fiscal  que 
estabelece um limite para os gastos do governo, excluindo o pagamento de juros, pode não garantir uma trajetória não 
explosiva da dívida pública. Nosso modelo nos permite mapear diferentes resultados em termos de estabilização da dívida 
pública  decorrentes  do  processo  de  consolidação  fiscal  e  concluir  que  o  comprometimento  da  autoridade  fiscal  em 
cumprir com o teto cortando os gastos do governo tem menor probabilidade de estabilizar a dívida pública em economias 
com  taxas  básicas  de  juros  excessivamente  altas,  acompanhadas  por  sistemas  de  tributação  mais  regressivos.  Nosso 
modelo  também  sugere  que  uma  estrutura  tributária  mais  progressiva  pode  aumentar  as  chances  de  alcançar  a 
estabilização da dívida pública no longo prazo.

Introduction 

 
1 
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial collapse in the U.S. followed by the Eurozone crisis, some of the world's 
major economies have entered a vicious cycle of slow growth, declining tax revenues and rising public debt. 
In this context, discussions on fiscal adjustment have gained importance in the debate amongst scholars from 
different academic circles and policymakers across the globe.  

One way to operationalise the fiscal tightening process is through the implementation of fiscal policy rules, 
defined  as the imposition of restrictions on fiscal  parameters. The  supporters of this view claim that in  the 
absence of a sound fiscal policy rule, some factors such as uncertainties associated with the macroeconomic 
scenario, structural imbalances and the aging of the population can prevent the economies from growing at 
their full potential (Kopits and Symansky, 1998). Ljungman (2008, p. 3) states that ‘fiscal rules can foster fiscal 
discipline  by  simplifying  decision  making,  promoting  an  interest  in  sustainability  issues,  and  reducing  the 
scope for time-inconsistent decisions’. A large number of fiscal rules can be adopted so that the type of rule to 
be  implemented,  as  well  as  its  potential  effectiveness,  is  intrinsically  related  to  the  political-institutional 
arrangement and the idiosyncratic structural condition of a particular country.  

The conventional view on public debt and fiscal policy, by and large, assumes that the economies tend to 
operate at full employment and so fiscal expansion is likely to conduct to higher inflation. In this framework, 
spending cuts eventually result in lower inflation and declining public debt as a proportion of output. However, 
given that market economies tend to operate with either desired (in order to accommodate unexpected demand 
shocks) or undesired (due to insufficient demand) excess capacity, an expansionary fiscal policy may have a 
significant impact on the level of activity without necessarily producing unwanted inflationary effects. Further, 
the dynamics of the public debt-to-output ratio following spending cuts becomes much more ambiguous once 
the effects of public expenditure on the level of economic activity are taken into account. Having said that, this 
paper contributes to the related literature by advancing a neo-Kaleckian framework that assumes an inflation-
free, closed economy operating with excess capacity in order to assess some aspects of the debate about the 
efficacy  of  expenditure  ceilings  in  promoting  public  debt  stability.  Unlike  the  conventional  view  on  public 
debt, the post-Keynesian growth literature have extensively discussed the importance of a more active fiscal 
policy  on  issues  such  as  the  stabilisation  of  economic  cycles,  income  distribution,  and  the  sustainability  of 
public debt (see e.g. Arestis and Sawyer, 2003; Hein, 2016; Palley, 2013; Ros, 1994; Setterfield, 2007; Skott, 
2016; Tcherneva, 2012; You and Dutt, 1996). However, this literature has neglected the possible effects on the 
trajectory of public debt and the level of economic activity caused by the adoption of a government expenditure 
ceiling.  This  paper  shows  how  a  fiscal  rule  that  merely  sets  a  limit  for  public  spending,  excluding  interest 
payments,  may  not  be  enough  to  ensure  a  non-explosive  trajectory  of  the  public  debt  to  output  ratio.  We 
demonstrate that the adoption of a government expenditure ceiling is less likely to stabilise the public debt in 
more unequal countries with more regressive tax systems and high interest rates compared to countries with a 
more even income distribution,  more progressive tax systems  and low interest  rates. However, in  countries 
enduring  excessively  high  levels  of  interest  rates,  our  model  shows  that  there  may  not  exist  a  level  of 
government  spending  as  a  proportion  of  output  within  the  economically  relevant  domain  that  ensures  the 
stabilisation of the public debt-to-output ratio and so the implementation of a government expenditure ceiling 
becomes completely ineffective.  

The remainder of this paper consists of section 2 wherein we briefly discuss some aspects involving the 
implementation  of  a  government  expenditure  ceiling  and  provide  some  preliminary,  motivating  empirical 
evidence.  Section  3  presents  the  structure  of  the model  in  the  short  run. Section  4  advances  the  theoretical 
framework describing the public debt dynamics in the long run and discusses its stability properties as well as 
some policy implications. Lastly, we conclude.

2  Government expenditure rules: a brief discussion 

2.1  Government expenditure rules and its features 
This paper focuses the analysis on the adoption of a government expenditure ceiling, which is understood as 
the  commitment  made  by  the  government  not  to  exceed  a  given  maximum  level  of  expenditure  previously 
announced. This leads us to the following questions: Why to choose a government expenditure ceiling instead 
of another fiscal policy rule? Ayuso-i-Casals (2012) lists the comparative advantages of expenditure rules over 
alternative fiscal rules. The author argues that the imposition of budget balance rules may be undesirable, as it 
is likely to lead governments to adopt pro-cyclical measures and so increase the tax burden at times of low 
activity levels. Alternatively, cyclically adjusted budget balance rules may be more effective in ensuring fiscal 
discipline  over  time  by  taking  into  account  fluctuations  in  the  economic  activity.  However,  one  of  the 
weaknesses of these rules is related to the uncertainties associated with the measurement of the cycle, which 
creates  difficulties  to  the  effective  conduct  of  fiscal  policy.  The  author  also  points  out  that  the  potential 
shortcomings of budget balance rules regarding its pro-cyclical features also apply to debt rules and revenue 
rules,  since  raising  taxes  during  crisis  is  not  usually  recommended  as  such  a  measure  could  further  reduce 
aggregate demand and aggravate the ongoing recession. Certainly a multi-annual deficit or revenue rule may 
mitigate the pro-cyclical bias. However, the problems associated with the assessment of the cycle may still 
emerge. The author, then, argues that such limitations of budget balanced rules, debt rules and revenue rules 
can be used to justify the implementation of expenditure rules. By imposing fiscal policy rules exclusively over 
the part of the budget that the government controls, the uncertainty regarding the attainment of the fiscal target 
is reduced and the goals of stability and predictability of the long-run public debt trajectory and the economic 
fluctuations  are  more  easily  achieved.  Additionally,  expenditure  ceilings  can  be  more  clearly  established, 
simpler to monitor and more transparent in terms of accountability and enforcement than other types of rules. 
Another important aspect of this discussion is the coverage of government spending. On the one hand, fiscal 
discipline requires all public expenditures to be subject to the ceiling. However, Ljungman (2008) states that 
other objectives, such as macroeconomic stability, may justify excluding from the ceiling some components of 
the government spending. In the short term, a large part of entitlements, such as health care and social security 
benefits,  is  fixed.  Nevertheless,  it  is  considered  that  through  changes  in  legislation  and  negotiations  in  the 
congress, in the medium term these social benefits can also be included under the ceiling. Thus, it is up to the 
policymaker  to  decide  which  items  that  constitute  government  spending  may  fall  outside  the  constraints 
imposed  by  the  expenditure  ceiling.  The  main  candidates  are  interest  payments  on  treasury  bonds  and 
cyclically-sensitive public spending items. 

In fact, interest payments are usually excluded from the expenditure ceiling. There are some arguments to 
justify this measure. Short-term interest rate fluctuations may affect the structure of the government debt. If 
these  interest  payments  were  included  under  the  ceiling,  an  increase  in  the  interest  rate  could  force  the 
government to reduce spending in other areas. Similarly, a reduction in interest would enlarge the fiscal space 
for the government to expand its spending in other key areas. Therefore, it is argued that short-term interest 
rate fluctuations tend to cancel out over time, which makes it difficult to justify the inclusion of debt service 
under the ceiling with the aim of maintaining the sustainability of the long-run public debt. A stronger argument 
against the inclusion of interest  payments  under the ceiling is  related to  the fact  that such a measure could 
create incentives for the government to sell public assets in order to reduce the stock of public debt. 

There is also a debate about whether or not to include spending restrictions on items that are sensitive to the 
business cycle, such as unemployment insurance and corporate subsidy programs with the aim of reheating the 
labour market. The possibility of smoothing economic fluctuations through fiscal corrective measures depends 
heavily  on  the  comprehensiveness  of  the  ceiling1.  However,  despite  the  debate  about  the  effectiveness  of 

                                                           
1 Case studies are not able to show the effectiveness of including or excluding such expenditures under the ceiling limits. In countries 
like  the  Netherlands  and  Sweden  these  expenses  are  included  in  the  ceiling.  In  the  case  of  Finland,  most  of  the  cycle-sensitive 
expenditure is outside the ceiling (Ljungman, 2008).

countercyclical measures in the literature, there seems to be some consensus in favor of allowing automatic 
stabilisers to operate freely (Perroti, 2005). As aforementioned, it is expected that in times of decline in the 
level  of  economic  activity,  spending  will  expand  due  to  the  increase  in  the  granting  of  benefits  such  as 
unemployment insurance and subsidies for companies, thus helping to recover the GDP growth trajectory. 

Notably,  there  is  a  large  consensus  amongst  a  number  of  scholars  and  policymakers  that  setting  a 
government expenditure ceiling associated with greater government commitment to comply with the fiscal rule 
seems to be the best way to ensure long-run public debt sustainability and growth. Nevertheless, the presumed 
efficacy of such a policy recommendation is heavily based on empirical evidence and case studies conducted 
exclusively for OECD and EU countries (Alesina and Bayoumi, 1996; Badinger, 2009; Debrun et al, 2008; 
Hallerberg et  al,  2007;  von Hagen, 1991;  von Hagen and Wolff, 2006). And  yet,  in  the case of developing 
countries and emerging markets enduring relatively high levels of interest rates, the theoretical justification for 
the simple adoption of a ceiling on public expenditure may seem like a patch of new clothes on an old garment, 
since this type of rule may even increase the instability of the long-run public debt by diminishing the effects 
of automatic fiscal stabilisers designed to mitigate economics fluctuations. The use of active fiscal policy as 
an  instrument  of  economic  stabilisation  may  be  especially  needed  in  times  of  poor  economic  performance 
accompanied by soaring risk premium and increased interest payments and so the adoption of a ceiling may 
unnecessarily prolong economic downturns and economic crises. 

2.2  An empirical assessment using quantile regressions 
Now  we  conduct  a  motivating,  preliminary  empirical  exercise  in  order  to  merely  illustrate  the  relationship 
between the adoption of a government expenditure ceiling and the dynamics of the public debt as a proportion 
of output across groups of countries at different stages of economic development. 

The sample consists of 29 developed and 17 developing countries2 and covers the period 1985-2015 (see 
the list of countries in the Appendix 1). The dependent variable in the model is the variation of the public debt 
(%GDP) and the independent variables are the lagged variation of the public debt (%GDP), general government 
net  lending  (%GDP),  GDP  growth  rate  and  a  dummy  accounting  for  the  implementation  of  government 
expenditure rules (see the descriptions of the variables in the Appendix 2). 

In this empirical model we will use quantile regression with panel data to estimate the parameters of interest. 
In  their  seminal  work,  Koenker  and  Bassett  (1978)  develop  a  methodology  that  allows  us  to  estimate  the 
relationship between a vector of regressors and different percentiles of the response variable. In the standard 
conditional mean analysis, the minimisation of the sum of squares of residuals ensures that the same number 
of observations above and below the median is obtained. Quantile regression, on the other hand, allows us to 
map out the partial effect of a specific regressor on any point of the conditional distribution of the dependent 
variable.  For  instance,  quantile  regression  permits  to  describe  how  regressor  variables  affect,  not  only  the 
median, but also all the 𝜏th quantile of the regressand. Moreover, this methodology is robust to asymmetric 
conditional distributions.  

The first step is to determine the order of integration of each variable. Then, we conduct panel unit root tests 
for all the variables of the model (see the results in Appendix 3) and conclude that the baseline equation to be 
tested is the following: 

∆𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0(𝜏) + 𝛽1(𝜏)∆𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛽2(𝜏)𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽3(𝜏)𝐺𝐺𝑁𝐿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽4(𝜏)𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ𝑖,𝑡 

where 𝜏 ∈ (0,1); the subscripts 𝑖 and 𝑡 account for country and time-period, respectively; 𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡 denotes the 
public  debt-GDP  ratio;  𝐸𝑅  is  the  expenditure  rule  dummy  which  is  equal  to  one  during  the  period  𝑡  when 
country 𝑖 adopts the rule and zero otherwise; 𝐺𝐺𝑁𝐿 stands for general government net lending as a proportion 
of GDP; and 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ is GDP growth rate. 

                                                           
2 We divide the countries in advanced and emerging markets according to the IMF’s WEO Database classification. 

 

Given  the  panel  data  structure  of  our  sample,  we  will  estimate  the  quantile  regression  on  stacked  data 
without allowing the autoregressive term to cut across cross-sections.  It is worth saying that it is out of the 
scope of this work to treat unobserved effects and endogeneity problems3. Thus, we are simply testing if the 
adoption  of  expenditure  rules  may  be  associated  with  the  stabilisation  of  the  public  debt-GDP  ratio. 
Additionally, we want to provide an answer to the following question: Do expenditure rules affect differently 
small and large variations of the public debt-GDP ratio? In other words, we seek to assess if countries exhibiting 
an  explosive  public  debt  trajectory  can  be  better  off  by  adopting  a  government  expenditure  rule.  Since 
variations in the lower (higher) quantiles are considered small (large), the quantile regression approach permits 
the description of the effectiveness of expenditure rules for different degrees of variation of the public debt-
GDP ratio.  

5 

So let us examine both figures below: 
 

[FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE] 

 

[FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE] 

 
The upper-left quadrants of Figures 1 and 2 show how the adoption of expenditure rules affects differently 
the  trajectory  of  public  debt-GDP  ratio  in  developed  and  developing  countries  respectively  across  all  the 
quantiles  of  the  conditional  distribution  of  the  dependent  variable.  As  shown  in  the  upper-left  quadrant  of 
Figures  1,  the  impact  of  the  implementation  of  expenditure  rules  on  variations  of  public  debt-GDP  ratio  is 
negative and statistically significant between the 20th and the 80th quantiles4, thus implying that, in advanced 
countries, periods in which public spending rules are being adopted are linked to a decrease in the public debt-
GDP  ratio  (the  quantile  curve  is  below  the  zero  line  for  all  the  percentiles).  Moreover,  note  that  the 
implementation  of  expenditure  rules  seems  to  be  more  effective  in  advanced  countries  exhibiting  larger 
variations  of  public  debt-GDP  ratio,  which  means  that  these  rules  are  indeed  associated  with  public  debt 
reductions  in  these  countries.  Meanwhile,  the  upper-left  quadrant  of  Figure  2  shows  that  the  adoption  of 
government spending rules in developing countries may affect adversely the  public debt-GDP trajectory. In 
these economies, the impact of the implementation of expenditure rules on the annual variation of the public 
debt-GDP ratio is positive and non-significant for all the percentiles of the conditional distribution (the quantile 
curve is now above the zero line for all the percentiles). Lastly, it is worth mentioning that all the other variables 
exhibit their expected signs in both groups of countries. That is, the lagged variation of public debt-GDP ratio 
affects positively the current variation of the public debt-GDP (upper-right quadrants of Figures 1 and 2), while 
both government net lending and GDP growth reduce the public debt variation across most of the quantiles of 
the conditional distribution (lower-left and lower-right quadrants of Figures 1 and 2, respectively). 

Although preliminary, our estimates suggest that, in spite of the variety of institutional forms of expenditure 
rules considered in the sample, by and large, setting limitations to government spending may not be enough to 
reduce and/or stabilise the public debt-GDP ratio in developing economies. In the next section, we move on to 
the analysis of a formal model and the conditions under which the implementation of a government expenditure 
ceiling may or may not yield greater stability of the government debt-to-output ratio. We seek to show that 
some  salient  features  commonly  associated  with  less  developed  countries  tend  to  reduce  the  capacity  of 
expenditure rules to tame public debt. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that, for simplicity, in the next sections 
we model only one type of expenditure rule as a representative case. We assume that the government sets a 
limit on public spending as a percentage of output. 

                                                           
3 In order to correctly estimate the baseline equation above one needs to take into  account the existence of unobserved time- and 
country-specific  effects.  Normally,  this  problem  can  be  solved  by  allowing  into  the  model  period-  and  country-specific  dummy 
variables. Moreover, simultaneity or reverse causality  must be  properly controlled for, since the explanatory variables  tend to be 
endogenous to the public debt dynamic. 
4 For the 30th percentile it is significant at 10%.

3  Capacity utilisation, capital accumulation and output growth in the short-run 
Suppose a closed economy with excess capacity utilisation that produces one type of good which is used for 
consumption  and  investment5.  Given  that  the  economy  operates  below  full  capacity,  the  rate  of  capacity 
utilisation adjusts to accommodate any excess demand or supply. Also assume that the functional distribution 
of income before taxation remains constant and that the price level of the economy does not change either, thus 
implying that the model is cast in real terms; this is a plausible assumption in an economy characterised by the 
existence of excess capacity, constant unit labour cost and constant mark-up factor.  There are two classes in 
the economy, workers and capitalists. Workers earn only wages and consume all their income. Capitalists are 
divided  into  entrepreneurs  and  rentiers.  While  entrepreneurs  earn  profits  of  enterprises  and  save  a  constant 
fraction of their income, rentiers earn income from the stock of credit granted to the government at a given 
interest rate set by the central bank and also save a constant fraction of their income. Suppose as well that there 
is  not  substitutability  between  labour,  physical  capital  and  financial  assets.  Thus,  the  function  of  aggregate 
consumption (𝐶) as a proportion of the potential output (𝑌𝑝) is given by: 

𝑐𝑣 =

𝐶
𝐾

𝐾
𝑌𝑝

= (1 − 𝜏𝑤)𝜎𝑢𝑣 + (1 − 𝑠)(1 − 𝜏𝑐)[(1 − 𝜎) + 𝑟𝜆]𝑢𝑣                           (1) 

where 𝑐 = 𝐶 𝐾⁄  is the ratio of aggregate consumption to the stock of capital (𝐾), 𝑣 = 𝐾 𝑌𝑝⁄ , 𝜏𝑤 and 𝜏𝑐 are the 
tax rates on labour and capital income, 𝜎 is the wage share of income, 𝑢  is equal to the ratio of output (𝑌) to 
the stock of capital, 𝑠 is the marginal propensity to save of capitalists, 𝑟 is the real interest rate (since prices 
are constant in the model, nominal interest rate equals real interest rate), 𝜆 = 𝐵 𝑌⁄  is the ratio of the stock of 
public debt (𝐵) to output. To save notation, it is assumed henceforth that the ratio of the capital stock to the 
potential output equals unity (𝑣 = 1) and so 𝑢 denotes the capacity utilisation. 

Assuming a simplified investment function where capital accumulation plans are positively related to the 
current rate of net profits of firms, which is taken as a proxy for the expected profits (Kalecki, 1971; Robinson, 
1956, 1962), we have: 

𝑖 =

𝐼
𝐾

= 𝛼0 + 𝛼1(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎)𝑢                                                   (2) 

where 𝑖 = 𝐼 𝐾⁄  is the total investment (𝐼) as a proportion of the capital stock, and 𝛼0, 𝛼1 > 0 are parameters. 
Our model assumes no depreciation of physical capital, for simplicity. 

Finally, we assume that government expenditure (𝐺), including the consumption of goods and services, is 

given as a proportion of capital stock: 

𝑔 =

𝐺
𝐾

= (𝑧𝛾 + 𝛾𝑇)𝑢                                                               (3) 

where 𝛾 = 𝐺 𝑌⁄ , 𝛾𝑇 is the government-stipulated expenditure ceiling as a proportion of output, and 𝑧𝛾 ≡ 𝛾 −
𝛾𝑇 is the expenditure gap. Note that for any positive (negative) value of the expenditure gap 𝑧𝛾 the government 
is spending above (below) the ceiling. Since this study aims to analyse the consequences of fiscal tightening, 
the initial condition of the model assumes that 𝑧𝛾 > 0.   

Since income in a demand-led closed economy is determined by the sum of consumption, investment, and 

government spending, we have: 

𝑢 = 𝑐 + 𝑖 + 𝑔                                                                   (4) 

                                                           
5 This model is close in spirit to Dutt (1984) and You and Dutt (1996).  

 

Assuming that 𝜏𝑤, 𝜎, 𝑟, 𝑠, 𝜆, 𝑧𝛾 and 𝛾𝑇 remain constant in the short run, by substituting from (1) – (3) into 

(4), and then solving for 𝑢, we obtain: 

7 

𝑢∗ =

𝛼0

𝜇 − 𝑧𝛾 − 𝛾𝑇

                                                                  (5) 

where 𝜇 = 1 − (1 − 𝜏𝑤)𝜎 − (1 − 𝑠)(1 − 𝜏𝑐)[(1 − 𝜎) + 𝑟𝜆] − 𝛼1(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎). Then 𝑢∗ is the degree of 
capital capacity utilisation that balances the goods market in the short run. The stability condition of the goods 
market  equilibrium in  (5) is  𝜇 − 𝑧𝛾 − 𝛾𝑇 > 0, which is  equivalent  to,  all else  constant,  the sum  of demand 
leakages being more responsive to changes in capital capacity utilisation than the sum of demand injections. 
Note  that  the  wage  share  is  directly  related  to  the  equilibrium  capacity  utilisation  𝑢∗.  Conversely,  given  a 
sufficiently low value of 𝛼1, a tax system that disproportionally burdens the lower class (∆𝜏𝑤 > 0 accompanied 
by ∆𝜏𝑐 < 0) impacts negatively on aggregate demand. Lastly, an expansionary fiscal policy, or a raise in 𝑧𝛾, 
subject to the constraint given by 𝜇 − 𝑧𝛾 − 𝛾𝑇 > 0, spurs aggregate demand.  

Substituting (5) into (2), we obtain: 

𝑖 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1

𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎)

𝜇 − 𝑧𝛾 − 𝛾𝑇

                                                     (6) 

Equation (6) represents the equilibrium accumulation rate in the short run.  
Lastly, we obtain the output growth rate in the short-run equilibrium. Considering that the capital capacity 

utilisation is constant, in equilibrium we have 𝑌̇ 𝑌⁄ = 𝑌̇𝑝 𝑌𝑝 =⁄

𝐼 𝐾⁄ . This gives: 

𝑦 =

𝑌̇𝑝
𝐼

𝑖𝑣                                                                        (7) 

where 𝑦 = 𝑌̇ 𝑌⁄ . If 𝑣 = 1, then 𝑌̇𝑝 𝐼 =⁄

1 as well. Equation (7), then, becomes: 

That is, the output growth rate equals the rate of capital accumulation. 
Next we develop the formal framework describing the public debt dynamics and discuss to which extent a 

government expenditure ceiling can contribute to the stabilisation of the public debt ratio over time. 

𝑦 = 𝑖                                                                          (8) 

4  The public debt and the government spending: the long-run dynamics 

4.1  The stability analysis 
As discussed in the introduction, setting a ceiling for government spending, not including interest payments, 
has been one of the main economic policy recommendations aimed at stabilising the business cycles and the 
trajectory of public debt over time. The aim of this section is to compare the stability conditions of the public 
debt dynamics before and after the implementation of  a government  expenditure ceiling. At this point, it is 
worth asking the following questions: Why, in a closed economy framework, should a sovereign government 
that issues treasury bonds in national currency care about the public debt trajectory? A quick answer to this 
question is that after a certain threshold the supply of bonds may exceed the demand of the public for bonds, 
thus forcing the government to finance new debt with seignorage6. Then, one may continue to ask: Why, in an 

                                                           
6 Another possibility is when the lender’s risk is a function of potential political chicanery (e.g., House Republicans in the U.S. 
refusing to increase the debt ceiling), as perceptively suggested by one of the anonymous referees.

economy with excess capacity, cannot the government monetise the public debt with domestic currency until 
it attains full employment with stable inflation? As a possible rejoinder, we can argue that the government does 
not have unlimited capacity to force the public to always accept additional money. This stems, for instance, 
from  the idea that the acceptability of money is  a social convention. Dequech (2013, p. 268) states that “if 
people do not believe that the state will be able to enforce tax liabilities, they will stop accepting that which 
the  state  establishes  as  the  means  of  payments  of  taxes”.  In  moments  of  economic  crises  and  soaring 
indebtedness,  governments  tend  to  lose  legitimacy,  thus  reducing  their  capacity  to  impose  taxes.  In  this 
scenario, the public may refuse to accept the current money and start using alternative means of payment to 
conduct  domestic transactions (Wray, 1998). Notably,  the limitations to the issuance of fiat  money  may be 
even  more  stringent  in  developing  countries  with  weaker  currencies  in  the  international  monetary  system. 
Therefore, even sovereign states that issue public bonds in their own currencies should pay attention to their 
level of indebtedness. 

That said, let us continue with the formal model. In the long-run dynamics the short-run equilibrium values 
of the variables are consistently attained so that in the long run the economic dynamics can be analysed through 
the behaviour of two short-run state variables, namely, the expenditure gap and the public debt-output ratio. 
For simplicity, assume that the high-powered money remains constant and so the overall government spending 
is financed through the issuing of public debt, as follows: 

𝐵̇ = (𝐺 − 𝑇) + 𝑟𝐵                                                              (9) 

where 𝑇 accounts for the total tax revenue. 

By definition, taxes as a proportion of output are given by: 

𝑇
𝐾

= 𝜌𝑢 = 𝜏𝑤𝜎𝑢 + 𝜏𝑐[(1 − 𝜎)𝑢 + 𝑟𝜆𝑢] 

𝜌 = 𝜏𝑤𝜎 + 𝜏𝑐[(1 − 𝜎) + 𝑟𝜆]                                                (10) 

where 𝜌 = 𝑇 𝑌⁄ . 

Given that the short-run equilibrium in the goods market is always satisfied, by substituting equations (9) 

and (10) into the time differential of 𝜆, which is given by 𝜆̇ = 𝜆(𝐵̇ 𝐵⁄ − 𝑖), we obtain: 

𝜆̇ = 𝑧𝛾 + 𝛾𝑇 − 𝜏 + [(1 − 𝜏𝑐)𝑟 − 𝛼0 − 𝛼1

𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎)

𝜇 − 𝑧𝛾 − 𝛾𝑇

] 𝜆                   (11) 

where 𝜏 = 𝜏𝑤𝜎 + 𝜏𝑐(1 − 𝜎) denotes the tax on labour income and physical capital income. Note that the total 
tax revenue as a proportion of output also includes the tax on financial income, that is 𝜌 = 𝜏 + 𝜏𝑐𝑟𝜆.  

The next step is to define the dynamical  equation of government spending constrained by  a government 

expenditure ceiling. This equation of motion can be defined as follows: 

𝑧̇𝛾 = −𝜃(𝑧𝛾 − 𝑧𝛾

𝑒)                                                             (12) 

𝑒 ≥ 0 is the expenditure gap desired by the fiscal authority, and 𝜃 is a parameters that accounts for the 
where 𝑧𝛾
speed of spending cuts. Equation (12) states that when current expenditure gap as a proportion of output 𝑧𝛾 is 
𝑒, public spending should be reduced until it converges towards the desired 
above the desired expenditure gap 𝑧𝛾
expenditure gap. On the other hand assume that it is irrational from the policymaker standpoint to maintain the 
current  level  of  public  expenditure  systematically  below  the  ceiling;  this  is  a  plausible  assumption,  as  the 
maintenance  of  the  current  government  spending  below  the  ceiling  over  a  prolonged  period  of  time  may 
underheat the labour market and engender social pressures for corrective fiscal policy measures. Note that, if 

𝑒 = 0.7 However, as a more general case, assume that initially we have 𝑧𝛾

 
the government is fully and credibly committed not to consistently spend beyond the ceiling, than 𝛾 = 𝛾𝑇 and 
𝑒 > 0. It is worth remarking 
hence 𝑧𝛾
that  we  have  introduced  the  variable  𝑧𝛾  instead  of  𝛾  in  order  to  normalise  the  equilibrium  level  of  public 
spending as a proportion of GDP to zero. Such a procedure was followed for methodological purposes in order 
to make the formal model more easily and intuitively tractable, as will become clear later on. 

Now assume that the risk and liquidity premia set  by the rentiers is positively related to the public debt-

output ratio, as follows: 

9 

𝑟 = 𝜂0 + 𝜂1𝜆                                                                  (13)  

where 𝜂0 and 𝜂1 are parameters. From rentiers’ standpoint, the higher the public debt as a proportion of output, 
the higher the default risk, and hence the higher the risk and liquidity premia lenders will require in order to 
keep  financing  new  government  spending.  However,  one  should  expect  that  sufficiently  low  levels  of 
indebtedness variations in the public debt-output ratio will not affect interest rates as the risk of default may be 
negligible. In the same manner, for an excessively high level of public debt-output ratio rentiers will not be 
willing  to  grant  more  credit  to  the  government  and  so  supply  of  credit  is  drastically  interrupted  as  lenders 
consider that the government will fail to fulfill its obligation. Thus, it is assumed that interest rates only respond 
to variations in the public debt-output ratio within the domain 𝜆𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝜆 < 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥, where 𝜆𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 are, 
respectively, the maximum and minimum values of  𝜆, which are exogenously given. Therefore, in order to 
simplify the analysis, suppose that the level of public debt-output ratio in the model falls within the domain 
given by 𝜆𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝜆 < 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥. 

The equilibrium level of public debt that satisfies the condition 𝜆̇ = 𝑧̇𝛾 = 0 in the long run is a forth degree 
equation and so it may have up to four real roots within the economically relevant domain 𝜆𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝜆 < 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥. 
For  simplicity,  assume  that  the  system  𝜆̇ = 𝑧̇𝛾 = 0  has  only  one  solution  within  this  domain,  which  is 
(𝑧𝛾

𝑒 ≥ 0, 𝜆𝑒 > 0). 
Equations (11) and (12) form a two-dimensional dynamical system. The Jacobian matrix evaluated at the 

equilibrium solution (𝑧𝛾

𝑒, 𝜆𝑒) is constituted by the following elements:

where 𝜇𝜆 = −(1 − 𝑠)(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(𝜂0 + 2𝜂1𝜆𝑒) < 0.  

Note that 𝐽11 and 𝐽12 are ambiguously signed. The stability condition of the system requires a negative trace 
and a positive determinant of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the equilibrium solution. Since 𝐽22 is invariably 
negative and 𝐽21 is equal to zero, the stability of the system depends exclusively on the sign of 𝐽11. That is, if 
𝐽11 < 0,  then  𝑇𝑟(𝐽) = 𝐽11 + 𝐽22 < 0  and  𝐷𝑒𝑡(𝐽) = 𝐽11𝐽22 − (0)𝐽21 > 0,  thus  implying  that  the  system  is 

                                                           
7 It is out of the scope of this paper to address the social costs stemming from the impossibility of meeting the ceiling. For a discussion 
on how the imposition of fiscal rules may encourage policymakers to engage in ‘creative accounting’ practices, thus reducing the 
transparency in the government budget, see Milesi-Ferreti (2003).

resulting in a saddle-point equilibrium solution.  

Figures  3  and  4  below  illustrate  both  the  unstable  and  the  stable  equilibria  solution  of  the  linearised

dynamical system in the long run, respectively:

Given  the  importance  of  the  sign  of  𝐽11  for  the  stability  of  the  public  debt  in  the  long  run,  we  raise  the 
following question: Does the implementation  of  a ceiling change the stability  condition  of the  public  debt-
output trajectory? In terms of the model, we want to compare two different scenarios: (i) The stability condition 
𝑒 = 𝑧𝛾0 > 0; (ii) The stability condition of the 
of the public debt trajectory before the fiscal adjustment when 𝑧𝛾
𝑒 is the temporary equilibrium 
economy after the fiscal adjustment when 𝑧𝛾
level of total public spending as a proportion of GDP before the fiscal adjustment around which the current 
level  of  government  spending fluctuates.  In this case, the fiscal  authority is  not  necessarily  concerned with 
pursuing the target 𝛾𝑇. In (ii) we have the case in which the fiscal authority makes a binding commitment with 
the fiscal rule and so effectively cuts public spending in order to meet the ceiling. More formally, equation (12) 
after the fiscal adjustment becomes 𝑧̇𝛾 = −𝜃𝑧𝛾. 

𝑒 = 0. In (i) it is assumed that 𝛾𝑇 + 𝑧𝛾

In order to address this question, consider 𝐽11 = 0 and rearrange the terms, as follows: 

𝜓𝑏2 − 𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎)𝑏 + 𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎)𝜆𝑒𝜇𝜆

𝑏2

= 0        (14) 

𝑒 − 𝛾𝑇 > 0. Therefore, the stability condition of the 
where 𝜓 = (1 − 𝜏𝑐)(𝜂0 + 2𝜂1𝜆) − 𝛼0 ≷ 0 and 𝑏 = 𝜇 − 𝑧𝛾
dynamical system is 𝜓𝑏2 − 𝛼1𝛼0𝑏 + 𝛼1𝛼0𝜆𝑒0𝜇𝜆 < 0. The real roots of the quadratic equation in (14) are given 
by: 

𝑏1 =

𝑏2 =

𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎) − √Δ
 

2𝜓

𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎) + √Δ
 

2𝜓

where Δ = [𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎)]2 − 4𝜓𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎)𝜆𝑒0𝜇𝜆 ≥ 0. Since 𝜇𝜆 < 0, the term Δ cannot 
be less than zero. Additionally, given that 𝜇𝜆 is strictly negative, we also conclude that 𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 −
𝜎) < √Δ.8 To save notation, let us examine exclusively the more general case in which the term Δ is strictly 
positive. 

From equation (14), now we analyse the stability properties of two possible scenarios: A) 𝜓 < 0; and B) 
𝜓 > 0. Scenario A (Scenario B) presents an economy where interest rate after taxation, (1 − 𝜏𝑐)(𝜂0 + 2𝜂1𝜆), 
is lower (higher) than the autonomous component of the investment function, 𝛼0.9 Since developing countries 
usually exhibit higher interest rates, it is plausible to state that scenario A (in which 𝜓 < 0) is more likely to 
illustrate  a  developed  economy,  while  the  scenario  B  (wherein  𝜓 > 0)  tends  to  represent  the  case  of  a 
developing country.

√[𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎)]2 = [𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎)]. 
9 Note that, from equation (13), we know that 𝑟 = 𝜂0 + 𝜂1𝜆, thus implying that 𝜓 can be rewritten as 𝜓 = (1 − 𝜏𝑐)𝑟 − 𝛼0. So, if 
interest rate is sufficiently low (high), we have 𝜓 lesser (greater) than zero.

From equation (14), we know that 𝑏 is strictly positive, 𝑏 = 𝜇 − 𝑧𝛾

𝑒 − 𝛾𝑇 > 0, in order to satisfy the stability 
condition  in  the  goods  market.  Given  that  𝜓 < 0  and  𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎) < √Δ,  the  term  𝑏2  is  strictly 
negative  and  hence  falls  outside  the  economically  relevant  domain  𝑏 > 0.  Therefore,  let  us  examine  the 
stability conditions both before and after the fiscal adjustment around 𝑏1 > 0. 

Assume in the first case that the expenditure gap before de fiscal adjustment 𝑧𝛾𝐵

∗ > 𝑏1. Suppose 
also that the government is fully committed to meet the ceiling and so the expenditure gap after the adjustment 
∗ > 𝑏1. Note in Figure  5 that the public debt-output ratio is  in  a stable path 
is 𝑧𝛾𝐴
before and after the fiscal adjustment. In terms of the model, we have the following stability condition: 

∗ = 0 which  gives 𝑏𝐴

∗  yields 𝑏𝐵

∗ > 𝑏𝐵

∗ < 𝑧𝛾𝐵

∗ < 𝜇 − 𝛾𝑇 − (

) < 𝜇 − 𝛾𝑇 

Since both 𝑧𝛾𝐵

∗ > 0 and 𝑧𝛾𝐴

∗ = 0 satisfy simultaneously the stability condition of the dynamical system 𝐽11 <
𝑒 − 𝛾𝑇 > 0 we conclude that in this case the public 

0 and the stability condition of the goods market 𝑏 = 𝜇 − 𝑧𝛾
debt-output ratio is stable before and after the fiscal adjustment. Figure 5.1 illustrates this dynamics. 
 

[FIGURE 5.1 ABOUT HERE] 

 
Assume now the case in which the expenditure gap before de fiscal adjustment 𝑧𝛾𝐵

∗ < 𝑏1. It implies 
that  in  the second  case  the  expenditure  gap  before  the  fiscal  adjustment  is  greater  that  the  expenditure  gap 
∗ = 0 
before de adjustment in the first case shown above. Again, the expenditure gap after the adjustment is 𝑧𝛾𝐴
∗.  We  can  see  in  Figure  5  that  the  public  debt-output  ratio  starts  in  an  unstable 
which  gives  𝑏𝐵
trajectory but the austerity measures effectively stabilise the public debt dynamics. Thus, we have the following 
stability condition: 

∗ < 𝑏1 < 𝑏𝐴

∗∗  yields 𝑏𝐵

The  expenditure  gap before the adjustment satisfies the stability  condition in  the  goods market  𝑏 = 𝜇 −
𝑒 − 𝛾𝑇 > 0, but  not  the dynamical  system stability condition given by 𝐽11 < 0. However, in  this case, the 
𝑧𝛾
∗  
government may stabilise the public debt-output ratio by meeting the expenditure ceiling. Also note that if 𝑧𝛾𝐵
violates  the  goods  market  stability  condition,  then  𝑏 < 0  which  is  impossible  in  the  model. See  Figure  5.2 
below. 
 

 [FIGURE 5.2 ABOUT HERE] 

 

 
There is a third case where we have 𝜇 − 𝛾𝑇 < |(𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎) − √Δ) 2𝜓⁄

|, which is equivalent 

to: 

12 

𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎) − √Δ

𝜇 − 𝛾𝑇 − (

2𝜓

) < 0 = 𝑧𝛾𝐴

∗ < 𝑧𝛾𝐵

∗ < 𝜇 − 𝛾𝑇 

In this case, the stability condition 𝐽11 < 0 does not hold and so the public debt-output trajectory is unstable 

before and after the fiscal adjustment. Figure 5.3 shows this case. 
 

[FIGURE 5.3 ABOUT HERE] 

 
Therefore, the model allows us to map out three different cases, as shown in Table 1: 

 

 

[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE] 

In order to further explore the three scenarios shown in Table 1, let us create two binary variables, namely, 
𝐷𝐵 coded 1 when the debt-GDP ratio is stable before the fiscal adjustment and 0 in the opposite case; and 𝐷𝐴 
coded 1 when the debt-GDP ratio is stable after the fiscal adjustment and 0 in the opposite case.  

In scenario A, the conditional probability of sustaining a stable debt-GDP ratio after the fiscal adjustment, 
given  that  the  debt-GDP  ratio  is  already  stable  before  the  expenditure  cut  is  equal  to  unity, 
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝐷𝐴 = 1|𝐷𝐵 = 1) = 1. On the other hand, scenario A shows that achieving a stable debt-GDP ratio after 
a fiscal tightening process becomes unequivocally less likely if the debt-GDP ratio is initially in an unstable 
trajectory, that is 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝐷𝐴 = 1|𝐷𝐵 = 0) = 𝜃0, wherein 0 ≤ 𝜃0 < 1. 

Next we analyse scenario B illustrating a development economy with sufficiently high interest rates in order 

to draw some comparisons.  
 
Scenario B – Developing economy (𝝍 > 𝟎) 
Now, the graphical representation of the stability condition (14) is given by: 
 

[FIGURE 6 ABOUT HERE] 

 
Again, from equation (14), we know that 𝑏 must strictly positive when the stability condition in the goods 
market holds. Given that 𝜓 > 0 and 𝛼1𝛼0 < √Δ, the term 𝑏1 < 0 does not satisfy such a condition and hence 
falls  outside  the  economically  relevant  domain,  that  is  𝑏 > 0.  That  said,  we,  then,  analyse  the  stability 
conditions both before and after the fiscal adjustment around 𝑏2 > 0.  

In  the  first  case,  the  expenditure  gap  before  de  fiscal  adjustment  𝑧𝛾𝐵

∗ < 𝑏2.  If  the  government 
∗ <
effectively meets the ceiling, then the expenditure gap after the adjustment is 𝑧𝛾𝐴
𝑏2. If we assume at first that 𝜇 − 𝛾𝑇 < |(𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎) + √Δ) 2𝜓⁄
|, then the public debt-output ratio 
can be stable before and after the government carries out the austerity measures. More formally, we have the 
following stability condition:  

∗ = 0, which gives 𝑏𝐵

∗   yields  𝑏𝐵

∗ < 𝑏𝐴

Note  that  both 𝑧𝛾𝐵

∗   and  𝑧𝛾𝐴

∗   satisfy  the  goods  market  and  the  dynamical  system  stability  conditions.  See 

Figure 6.1 below for a graphical representation. 

 

[FIGURE 6.1 ABOUT HERE] 

 
∗  
In the second case, suppose once more that the expenditure gap before de fiscal adjustment given by 𝑧𝛾𝐵
yields 𝑏𝐵
|. It means that for 
∗ = 0 the stability condition of the dynamical system does not hold after the fiscal adjustment. In terms of 
𝑧𝛾𝐴
the model, we obtain the following stability condition: 

∗ < 𝑏2. However, assume now that 𝜇 − 𝛾𝑇 > |(𝛼1𝛼0𝑠(1 − 𝜏𝑐)(1 − 𝜎) + √Δ) 2𝜓⁄

In  the  second  case  the  expenditure  gap  before  the  fiscal  adjustment  given  by  𝑧𝛾𝐵

∗   satisfies  the  stability 
condition of the dynamical system represented by 𝐽11 < 0. However, by meeting the expenditure ceiling, the 
government violates the stability properties of the system and so the commitment with the fiscal rule may set 
the public debt-output trajectory in an explosive path over time. Therefore, in this case, the fiscal authority is 
better off by not cutting public expenditure since it maintains the public debt-output ratio in a stable trajectory. 
The second case is shown in Figure 6.2. 

 

[FIGURE 6.2 ABOUT HERE] 

 
We also have the third case in which expenditure gap before de fiscal adjustment 𝑧𝛾𝐵

∗ . It 
means that in this case the expenditure gap before the fiscal adjustment is greater than the expenditure gap 
before de adjustment in the first two cases of scenario B. Again, since the expenditure gap after the adjustment 
is 𝑧𝛾𝐴

∗∗. Thus, we have the following stability condition: 

∗ = 0, we have 𝑏2 < 𝑏𝐵

∗  yields 𝑏2 < 𝑏𝐵

∗∗ < 𝑏𝐴

In this case, the public debt-output ratio is in an explosive path and a greater commitment of the fiscal authority 
to meet the ceiling does not help the government to stabilise the public debt as a proportion of output. Figure 
6.3 shows this case. 
 

 
In short, in an economy with excessively high interest rates we have the following cases: 

[FIGURE 6.3 ABOUT HERE] 

14 

 

 

[TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE] 

 
This section allows us to draw some conclusions regarding the efficacy of a government expenditure ceiling 
for  the  stabilisation  of  the  public  debt-output  ratio.  Comparing  scenarios  A  and  B  (for  developed  and 
developing economies, respectively) we see that the implementation of a government expenditure ceiling in 
economies enduring excessively high interest rates, 𝜓 > 0, increases the propensity for public debt instability 
caused  by  the  process  of  fiscal  consolidation.  Note  that  while  in  scenario  A  illustrating  economies  with 
sufficiently  low  interest  rates  we  have  one  case  in  which  the  fiscal  adjustment  destabilises  the  public  debt 
trajectory, in scenario B we have two cases wherein the public debt-output ratio becomes unstable after the 
fiscal tightening process.  

More  formally,  consider  again  the  two  binary  variable  𝐷𝐵  and  𝐷𝐴  aforementioned.  In  scenario  B,  the 
conditional probability of sustaining a stable debt-GDP ratio after the fiscal adjustment, given that the debt-
GDP ratio is already stable before the expenditure cut is less than unity, 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝐷𝐴 = 1|𝐷𝐵 = 1) = 𝜃1, where 
0 ≤ 𝜃1 < 1. It is worth noting that in the same case for scenario A we have 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝐷𝐴 = 1|𝐷𝐵 = 1) = 1.  

 On the other hand, scenario B shows that achieving a stable debt-GDP ratio after the fiscal adjustment is 
nearly impossible if the debt-GDP ratio is initially in an unstable trajectory, that is 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝐷𝐴 = 1|𝐷𝐵 = 0) =
0. Note that in the same case for scenario A we have 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝐷𝐴 = 1|𝐷𝐵 = 0) = 𝜃0, where 0 ≤ 𝜃0 < 1. 

Therefore, our model suggests that the strictly dominant strategy for developing economies with explosive 
public debt path is not to adopt fiscal austerity measures. In this particular case, a fiscal tightening process may 
only reduce the wellbeing of the population by cutting the provision of essential public goods and services, 
without eventually achieving the supposedly positive outcome of debt stability. 

4.2  The role of a more progressive tax system for public debt stability  
When  a  cutting-based  fiscal  consolidation  does  not  result  in  a  stable  level  of  public  debt-output  ratio, 
policymakers  may  resort  to  tax  increases.  In  this  context,  the  analysis  of  the  efficacy  of  different  taxation 
strategies  (regressive,  proportional  and  progressive  taxes)  becomes  particularly  relevant.  In  this  section  we 
investigate, without loss of generality, the impact of a taxation strategy that burdens disproportionally low-
income groups on the stability properties of the dynamics of the public debt-output ratio. In other words, we 
seek to assess whether a more regressive tax structure may or may not help to stabilise an unstable public debt 
dynamics.  

Assuming  the  overall  tax  rate  is  kept  constant (𝜌̅),  a  drop  in  the  tax  rate  on  capital  income  results  in  a 
proportional rise in the tax rate on labour income. By substituting equation (13) into (10) and then rearranging 
terms, we have: 

Plugging (15) into 𝐽11, and assuming that the fiscal authority effectively meets the ceiling 𝑧𝛾

𝑒 = 0, we have:  

𝜏𝑐 =

Note  that  𝜓  is  ambiguously  signed  (and  so  a  sufficiently  high  tax  rate  on  labour  income  increases  the 
propensity for obtaining 𝜓 > 0), 𝑡 > 0 is the stability condition in the goods market, 𝜇𝜆 remains negatively 
signed, Φ is invariably positive, and Ω is ambiguously signed (but Ω > 0 makes it more likely that the stability 
condition in the goods market will be satisfied). The sign of Ω will not alter the outcomes of the model as long 
as 𝑡 remains positively signed. 

Suppose that initially the public debt-output ratio is in an unstable trajectory, that is 𝐽11 > 0. Then, what is 
the  partial  effect  of  a  raise  in  the  tax  rate  on  labour  income  𝜏𝑤  on  the  stability  condition  𝐽11?  The  partial 
derivative of 𝐽11 with respect to 𝜏𝑤 is given by:

In equation (17) the only term that contributes to a reduction in 𝐽11 following a raise in the tax rate on labour 
′ < 0. Therefore, an after-tax redistribution of income in favour of capital, that is a raise in 𝜏𝑤 
income 𝜏𝑤 is 𝜇𝜆
accompanied by a proportional  drop in  𝜏𝑐, increases the propensity for obtaining an  explosive public debt-
output  trajectory  over  time.  In  other  words,  everything  else  constant,  more  regressive  tax  structures  that 
disproportionally burden low-income households may reduce the effectiveness of the fiscal austerity measures. 
In terms of policy, this results show that a more progressive tax system may often be a key contributing factor 
to the stabilisation of the level of public debt as a proportion of output. 

5  Conclusions 
This paper reassesses the potential efficacy of a binding ceiling on government expenditure in promoting the 
sustainability of public debt in a demand-led macromodel along neo-Kaleckian lines.  

The proponents  of the conventional  view on public debt  argue that the implementation  of  a government 
expenditure ceiling may help economies enduring unsustainable public debt trajectories to achieve public debt 
stability over time. However, our empirical and theoretical frameworks show that by merely setting a limit for 
public  spending  without  including  interest  payments  under  the  ceiling  may  not  ensure  a  non-explosive 
trajectory  of  the  public  debt-to-output  ratio,  particularly  in  the  case  of  developing  countries  enduring  high 
levels  of  interest  rates  and  more  regressive  taxation  systems.  Further,  we  demonstrate  as  well  that  a  less 
regressive taxation structure may increase the propensity of the system to a stable  public debt dynamics. In 
short, we show that the implementation of a ceiling on public spending is more likely to reinforce the stability 

16 

 
conditions of the public debt-to-output ratio in economies where the public debt trajectory is already in a stable 
path. In economies where the level of public indebtedness is already in an explosive trajectory, the contribution 
of a government expenditure ceiling to the stabilisation of the public debt seems to be considerably much less 
effective. 

Lastly, one might argue that our model rests on some restrictive hypotheses such as fixed wages and prices, 
absence of credit to firms, no external sector, and no revision of the government expenditure ceiling. In fact, 
relaxing such assumptions might create a number of interesting scenarios, especially some incorporating fixed 
and  floating  exchange  rate  regimes,  inflation  and  inflationary  tax  in  an  economy  possibly  operating  at  full 
capacity  utilisation  as  well,  and  different  revision  rules  for  a  non-binding  ceiling  on  public  expenditure. 
However interesting, given our focus on the derivation of a first set of clear-cut analytical results, we leave 
these further interesting questions for future research.

The Panel Unit Root test proposed by Im et al (2003) was chosen as it is the most appropriate technique for 
unbalanced panels. Note that the evidence of non-stationarity of the variable 𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡 in level is mixed for the 
sample of developed countries, while it seems unambiguously non-stationary for developing countries. Thus, 
we take the first difference of this variable before estimating the econometric model. The test also suggests 
that  variable  𝐺𝐺𝑁𝐿  is  stationary  in  developed  countries,  but  the  results  for  developing  countries  are 
inconclusive. In this case we decided to include the variable in level in the baseline equation in order to favour 
comparability  between  the  estimates  of  both  groups  of  countries.  Lastly,  the  test  shows  that  the  variable 
𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ is invariably stationary.

Description 
General government gross debt (% GDP) consists of all liabilities that require payment or payments 
of interest and/or principal by the debtor to the creditor at a date or dates in the future. This includes 
debt liabilities in the form of SDRs, currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, insurance, pensions 
and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable.  
Expenditure rules set limits on total, primary, or current spending. Such limits are typically set in 
absolute terms or growth rates, and occasionally in percent of GDP with a time horizon ranging often 
between three to five years (Schaechter et al, 2012).  
General  government  net  lending  (+)/borrowing  (-)  (%  GDP)  is  calculated  as  revenue  minus  total 
expenditure.  This  balance  may  be  viewed  as  an  indicator  of  the  financial  impact  of  general 
government activity on the rest of the economy and nonresidents.  

𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ  Gross  domestic  product,  constant  prices  (percent  change).  The  base  year  is  country-specific. 
Expenditure-based GDP is total final expenditures at purchasers’ prices (including the f.o.b. value of 
exports of goods and services), less the f.o.b. value of imports of goods and services.

Notes: The null hypothesis is that the variable follows a unit root process in all groups, while the alternative hypothesis is that at least 
in one group the variable is stationary. In order to control for potential autocorrelation and cross-sectional dependence in the residuals, 
we included lagged differences of the variable in each test. The choice of lags was based in the Schwartz information criterion. We 
report the p-values in brackets below the test statistics.
