ABSTRACT 
The  understanding  of  the  scenario  of  social  inequalities  in  Brazil  reveals  the  overrepresentation  of  the 
black population in lower education and income classes, as well as the concentration of high victimization 
rates  on  blacks,  exposing  the  fragility  of  a  conception  of  racial  democracy.  In  this  work,  the  research 
efforts  were  directed  to  identify,  at  the  national  level,  the  mechanisms  of  reproduction  for  the 
phenomenon of racial  discrimination  manifested by homicides and physical  assault,  as well as to verify 
how  this  situation  is  expressed  according  to  the  specific  realities  of  each  Brazilian  Federative  Unit. 
Combining the information  from  the PNAD (2009) to  the mortality data  of the SIM/DATASUS  for the 
same  period,  the  methodology  of  decomposition  of  Oaxaca-Blinder  was  applied.  The  obtained  results 
reveal that a significant portion of the differential of victimization between blacks and non-blacks is due 
to racial discrimination in the country. Complementarily, in the period under review, both for homicides 
and  for  physical  assault,  a  more  discriminatory  scenario  was  observed  on  the  black  population  that 
converges to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, regions historically characterized by high social 
inequalities and violent mortality.

RESUMO 
A  compreensão  sobre  o  cenário  de  desigualdades  sociais  no  Brasil  revela  a  sobrerrepresentação  da 
população negra nas classes de escolaridade e renda mais baixas, além da concentração de elevadas taxas 
de vitimização sobre indivíduos negros, expondo a  fragilidade de uma  concepção de democracia racial. 
Neste estudo, portanto, os esforços de pesquisa foram direcionados para identificar, no plano nacional, os 
mecanismos  de  reprodução  do  fenômeno  de  discriminação  racial  manifesto  pela  vitimização,  por 
homicídios  e  agressão  física,  bem  como  verificar  como  esta  situação  se  expressa  segundo  as  realidades 
específicas  a  cada  Unidade  Federativa  brasileira.  Combinando-se  as  informações  da  PNAD  (2009)  aos 
dados  sobre  mortalidade  do  SIM/DATASUS  para  o  mesmo  período,  aplicou-se  a  metodologia  de 
decomposição  de  Oaxaca-Blinder.  Os  resultados  obtidos  evidenciaram  que,  parcela  significativa  do 
diferencial  de  vitimização  entre  negros  e  não  negros  indica  dever-se  à  discriminação  racial  no  país.  De 
forma complementar, no período em apreço, tanto para homicídios quanto para agressão física, observou-
se  um  cenário  mais  discriminatório  sobre  a  população  negra  que  converge  para  as  regiões  Norte  e 
Nordeste do Brasil, regiões historicamente caracterizadas por elevados índices de desigualdades sociais e 
de mortalidade violenta.

1.  Introduction 

through 

In  Brazil,  despite 

the  universalizing  progress,  consolidated 

 
the  process  of 
redemocratization,  as  for  the  protection  of  human  and  civil  rights,  the  absence  of  strong  initiatives  to 
guarantee the availability of security for the entire population - verified through the understanding of the 
Brazilian inequality framework, taking also into account violent crimes -, reveals the intensity with which 
criminality  and  victimization  rates  have  expanded  in  our  country  since  the  1980s  (SOUZA,  2009; 
CARVALHO; SILVA, 2011; WAISELFISZ, 2015; CERQUEIRA et al., 2018). 
According  to  Cerqueira  et  al.  (2018),  Brazil  registered  a  total  of  62,517  homicides  in  2016, 
 
representing  an  increase  of  25.8%  in  this index  compared  to  the  year  of  2006,  when  there  were  49,704 
violent deaths in the country. 
 
In turn, the National Household Sampling Survey (PNAD) of 2009 reveals that, in this same year, 
nearly  2.5  million  people  suffered  some  kind  of  physical  assault.  This  context  is  corroborated  by  the 
National Research of Victimization, published in 2013, in which 14.3% of those interviewed experienced 
some sort of aggression or threat to their integrity (MINISTÉRIO DA JUSTIÇA et al., 2013). 
 
These  studies  and  surveys  testify  that,  even  though  they  are  dispersed  heterogeneously  both 
temporally  and  spatially  in  the  country,  violence  against  physical  integrity  (homicides  and  physical 
assaults)  are  concentrated  among  the  male  population,  especially  among  young  individuals6,  of  low-
income  class  and  with  black  ethnic-racial  identity7  (PNAD,  2009;  MINISTÉRIO  DA  JUSTIÇA  et  al., 
2013;  CERQUEIRA  et  al.,  2018).  Not  to  mention,  such  researches  uncover  that  the  dynamics  of 
victimization have two dimensions: (i) interiorization, concentrated on the states, according to the gaps in 
the  performance  of  the  state,  forming  an  intra-state  movement;  (ii)  dissemination/spreading,  which 
similarly  to  the  previous  concept,  constitutes  an  interstate  tendency,  concentrated  on  specific  regions, 
such  as  the  north  and  the  northeast,  with  a  lack  of  public  resources  and  inefficient  state  performance 
(WAISELFISZ, 2015; CERQUEIRA et al., 2018). 
 
Therefore, at the national level, it is observed that victimization unveil a trajectory corresponding 
to  the  persistence  of  a  discretionary  profile,  especially  in  relation  to  the  categories  of  race/ethnicity, 
income, age group and gender/sex. This scenario of violence is closely related to the Brazilian inequality 
framework,  which  is  deep  and  inextricable  from  the  historical  process  of  the  socio-political-economic 
constitution  of  Brazil  (COELHO,  1978;  PAIXÃO,  1990;  ADORNO,  1995;  MISSE,  2007).  In  this 
context, there is an overrepresentation of black people, either in the lower-income8 strata or in the lower 
levels of education9 (PNAD, 2015). 
 
Regarding lethal violence, in the period between 2006 and 2016, while black homicide rates rose 
by  23.1%,  a  rate  for  non-black  experienced  a  contraction  of  6.8%.  Moreover,  in  2016,  the  index  of 
homicides  for  black  people  (40.2%)  surpassed  two  and  a  half  times  the  non-black  homicide  rate  (16%) 
(CERQUEIRA  et  al.,  2018).  In  addition,  the  Index  of  Youth  Vulnerability  to  Violence  and  Racial 
Inequality (IVJ - Violence and Racial Inequality), published in 2017 -  base year of 2015 - noticed that in 
the national average, the young black population is 2.7 times more likely to become victims of murders 
than young whites (BRASIL, 2017). 
 
As  stated  by  the  PNAD  (2009),  a  higher  relative  frequency  of  occurrences  of  physical  assault 
among blacks (1.8%) prevails when compared to non-blacks (1.3%). This condition was also certified by 

                                                 
6  Nevertheless,  besides  the  deep  scenario  of  social  inequality,  such  numbers  also  reveal  the  human  capital  subtraction  -  a 
fundamental element for the development and economic growth of any nation -, corresponding, in 2010, for the Brazilian case, 
a portion of 1.5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (CERQUEIRA; MOURA, 2013a). 
7 According to the methodology proposed by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the category "blacks" 
includes  the  subcategories  "blacks"  and  "browns".  This  methodology  is  adopted  by  several  surveys  and  empirical  studies 
carried out by different institutions and research entities. 
8 According to information from PNAD (2015), the black population represents 74.0% of the income percentile of the poorest 
10% of the Brazilian population - while the white population represents only 26.0% -, and only 28.8% of the income percentile 
of the richest 10% - and the white population represents 71.2%. 
9 According to information from PNAD (2015), in the segment of the population with educational level up to seven years of 
study, 59.6% corresponds to blacks  against 40.4% of non-blacks. In the segment  with 12  years of study or  more, the blacks 
correspond to 34.7%, whereas the white population represents 65.3% of the total.

the National Research of Victimization released in 2013 (MINISTÉRIO DA JUSTIÇA et al., 2013). 
This context suggests forceful evidence for the argument in favor of contestation to the possibility 
 
that  the  Brazilian  nation  is  currently  erected  under  solid  values  of  a  racial  democracy,  as  postulated  by 
Freyre  (1933,  1936).  For  this  reason,  this  study  proposes  to  understand  how  ethnic-racial  identity 
differentiates victimization by physical assault and by homicide in Brazil, focusing on the period between 
September/2008  and  September/2009.  Furthermore,  the  comprehension  of  the  possible  connections 
between victimization and racial inequality in Brazil supposes an exploration in depth of the mechanisms 
that allow its reproduction and perpetuation. 
This  paper  comprises  four  sections  besides  this  introduction.  The  second  section  presents  the 
 
theoretical framework that serves as the basis for the other sections. The third section is composed by the 
methodology,  in  addition  to  exploring  the  databases.  Section  four  sets  out  the  adjustment  estimates  for 
both  variables  of  interest  (homicides  and  physical  assault),  as  well  as  the  corresponding  results  and 
analyzes  for  the  Oaxaca-Blinder  decomposition  for  each  victimization  variable.  Finally,  the  main 
conclusions of this study are presented. 

2.  Literature review 

 
Despite  the  wide  debate  about  the  phenomenon  of  criminal  violence  within  the  Economic 
Sciences10 since the late 1960s, with the pioneering works of Fleisher  (1963, 1966) and Ehrlich (1967), 
however,  the  Economic  Theory  of  Crime  has  consolidated  as  an  independent  field  of  economic 
knowledge, and with a specific theoretical framework, only with the seminal studies proposed by Becker 
(1968)  and  Ehrlich  (1973)  (CERQUEIRA;  LOBÃO,  2004).  Among  the  criminological  approaches  that 
encompass the basic  components that make it possible to  understand the process  of victimization11 as a 
result  of  crime,  we  can  highlight  the  Theory  of  Social  Disorganization,  Lifestyle  Theory,  and  Routine 
Activities Approaches Theory. 

With  the  publication  of  seminal  empirical  studies  developed  by  Shaw  and  McKay  (1969),  the 
Theory of Social Disorganization inaugurates a  new perspective on the  analysis of crime, incorporating 
other  factors  such  as  environmental  and  socioeconomic  aspects.  Thus,  this  theoretical  approach  focuses 
on the dynamics of local communities, understanding them as a complex system of formal and informal 
relationships,  kinship,  friendship  and  others  that  act  in  the  individual  process  of  social  and  cultural 
learning.  Moreover,  such  connections  would  be  shaped  by  structural  issues  such  as  economic  status, 
ethnic diversity, residential mobility, urbanization and family cohesion. The social disorganization level 
would  condition  the  establishment  of  complex  networks  of  systemic  connections  that  would  allow  to 
determine the degree of social control (SAMPSON, 1997). As a result, the criminal phenomenon would 
emerge  as  a  consequence  of  the  disorganization  of  this  intricate  network  of  community  relations 
(ENTORF; SPENGLER, 2002). 
Regarding  Lifestyle  Theory,  the  contributions  and  studies  developed  by  Hindelang  et  al.  (1978) 
 
focus on analyzing the connections between victimization and the individual's lifestyle, highlighting the 
central role of individual expectations - a set of personal preferences and behavioral patterns, determined 
by  personal  characteristics  and  cultural  norms/rules  -  and  the  social  structure;  or  in  the  process  of 
mediation between the private and the public, the external environment - the society, or the State - infers 
limitations to  the individual  who tmust adapt. The authors  emphasize that both,  expectations and social 
structure,  depend  on  demographic  conditions,  although  the  former  are  not  the  result  of  demographic 
circumstances.  In  addition,  Hindelang  et  al.  (1978)  postulate  that  the  victimization12  process  comprises 

                                                 
10 The subject of crime finds fertile ground among the classics of economic literature, since the seminal studies of Adam Smith 
(1776) and Bentham (1789, 1843), to Durkheim (2002). 
11 In order to understand the criminal behavior, the economic literature considers the criminal phenomenon as analogous to a 
market. In this sense, in order to adapt to the theoretical methodology in question, it is understood the problem of victimization 
as a demand for crimes. 
12  In  this  sense,  the  probability  of  attending  to  this  set  of  factors  and,  therefore,  victimization  is  not  a  uniformly  distributed 
phenomenon, but depends on innumerable constraints, such as specific time and location, potential victims and criminals with 
particular  demographic  characteristics,  as  well  as  potential  connections  between  the  potential  victim  and  the  offender 
(HINDELANG et al., 1978).

the  articulation  of  three  situations:  the  temporal  encounter  between  a  victim  and  an  offender;  the 
perception  of  a  potential  victim  by  the  offender;  and  the  impetus  by  the  offender  to  use  violence  to 
achieve their goal. 

Faced  with  the  advance  of  academic  clashes  over  crime,  the  Routine  Activities  Approaches 
Theory,  postulated  by  Cohen  and  Felson  (1979),  proposes  an  extension  of  the  Hindelang  et  al.  (1978), 
arguing  that  the  achievement  of  crimes  presupposes  the  confluence  of  three  elements,  namely:  the 
potential victim; the potential criminal; and, a safety/security mechanism, determined by the lifestyle of 
the potential victim. As the lifestyle depends on the individual's idiosyncratic characteristics - the way of 
seeing, feeling and reacting, specific to each person -, their age and gender, as well as family, professional 
and social relationships. For this reason, assuming that the worldview does not depend on the individual's 
skin  tone,  it  is  understood  that  younger  individuals  would  be  exposed,  due  to  their  circle  of  social 
relations  and  set  of  riskier  activities,  to  homicidal  violence.  In  addition,  family,  professional  and  social 
relationships  are  related  to  socioeconomic  status  -  educational  level,  housing  conditions,  etc.  -  and 
accessibility  to  the  institutional  and  legal  structure  -  availability  of  mechanisms  for  protection  and 
resolution  of  social  conflicts  -,  revealing  that  such  a  marginalized  population  is  more  likely  to  be 
victimized (COHEN; FELSON, 1979). 

Regarding the issue of racial discrimination, it should be emphasized that the Economic Theory of 
Crime does not present a specific approach that considers this theme completely. Therefore, the economic 
literature on crime that deals with this discussion uses racial discrimination theories developed within the 
scope of the Economics of Education and Labor Economics. In this context, there are theoretical models 
that  associate  the  socioeconomic  condition  of  the  black  population  -  a  reflection  of  historical  processes 
such as the abolitionist model, and the intrinsic patriarchal and racist ideology - with consequences in the 
scope of educational process and insertion in the labor market (BEHMAN; GAVIRIA; SZÉKELY, 2001). 
In  addition,  some  theories  discuss  the  persistence  of  intergenerational  discrimination  by  understanding 
that the conservative ideals  of machismo and patriarchalism  are consistent  with the perpetuation  of low 
levels  of  education  for  blacks,  since  the  transmission  of  teachings  to  children  is  transferred  to 
responsibility of mothers with low educational level (BLACK et al., 2005).  

Other theoretical approaches in the labor market argue about the performance of employers who 
censure hiring and even the career plan of black individuals, according to Becker's (1971) mechanism for 
a  taste  for  discrimination.  On  the  other  hand,  some  theories  understand  that  the  discriminatory  action 
relative to a certain social group favors the persistence of the marginalization of the black population in 
the  labor  market.  According  to  the  perspective  of  the  labor  demand,  the  phenomenon  called,  by  Arrow 
(1973), of statistical  discrimination, occurs when  the employer, in  the face of a problem  of  information 
asymmetry about the possible candidates, hires and/or pays wages according to an observable (subjective) 
criterium,  which  is  the  individual's  skin  tone.  From  the  viewpoint  of  the  job  offer,  Silvério  (2002) 
identifies the discriminatory issue as a consequence of psychological problems and self-esteem that afflict 
individuals seeking employment. 

This  scenario  consolidates  the  phenomenon  called  by  Oliveira  Junior  and  Lima  (2013) 
institutional racism, which derives from the state's organizational deficiency to respond to daily demands 
and  contributes  to  the  maintenance  of  racial  discrimination.  Furthermore,  it  is  understood  that  the 
connection  point  between  the  theoretical  approaches  of  the  Crime  Economy  with  the  economic  aspects 
related to the labor market and the educational process is the understanding that the socioeconomic and 
environmental  factors  are  reproductive  mechanisms  of  racial  discrimination  that,  when  associated  with 
the  racist  culture/ideology  -  which  socially  stigmatize  the  black  population  and  perpetuate  racial 
stereotypes  -  contributes  to  the  concentration  of  victimization  and  marginalize  blacks  from  access  to 
public power in Brazil (CERQUEIRA; MOURA, 2013b; CERQUEIRA; COELHO, 2017). 

3.  Methodology 

Given that in both regressions - homicides and physical assault - constitute dummy variables, the 
Oaxaca-Blinder  mechanism,  through  the  adaptation  proposed  by  Yun  (2004),  allows  for  the 
decomposition  for  nonlinear  models.  This  procedure  comprises  two  interrelated  stages,  namely:  (i) 

 

4 

estimation - and later competition13 with the probit model - of the logit model, for both regressors; and (ii) 
the  differential  decomposition  of  the  probability  of  victimization  by  violent  mortality  and  physical 
assault, among black and non-black14 population groups, applying the Oaxaca-Blinder methodology. 

3.1. Racial discrimination and violence against physical integrity 

For this reason, adapting the methodology proposed by Cerqueira and Coelho (2017)15, the logit16 
  
model  estimated  for  both  victimization  variables  -  whether  for  homicide  or  for  physical  assault  -  will 
include the following structure: 

                                                                                               (1) 

where, β0 is the constant term. βl, with l = 1, 2 and 3, are the estimated parameters for the three blocks of 
the  model’s  explanatory  variables,  namely:  (i)  individual  characteristics  -  gender,  age  group, 
ethnicity/race and marital status -; (ii) a set of socioeconomic attributes - income17 and educational level 
(years  of  study);  and,  (iii)  place  of  residence  -  state/Federative  Unit  (UF)  and  great  geographic  region. 
Finally, εit corresponds to the stochastic/random error term of the econometric model. 

As argued above, both dependent variables represented in (1) by Victmizationit=[1,0] estimate the 
probability  of  the  individual  “i”  becoming  a  victim  (Yi  =  1)  regarding  the  probability  of  not  being 
victimized (Yi = 0), respectively, for homicide and physical assault, also called by  relative risk (or odds 
ratio), at time t. 

3.2. Empirical strategy 

The  basic  mechanism  proposed  by  Oaxaca  (1973)  and  Blinder  (1973),  is  the  estimation  of 
mincerian18 equations for blacks and non-blacks. In this study, the explained variables are homicides and 
physical  assault,  and  as  regressors  there  are  three  blocks  of  variables,  which  are:  (i)  individual 
characteristics; (ii) a set of socioeconomic attributes; and, (iii) the place of residence. 

Through the following two equations, the counterfactual victimization of blacks is estimated in the 

possibility that they present the condition of non-blacks, incorporating the estimated coefficients (
s) of 
the  equations  for  non-blacks  (white,  "W")  in  the  respective  equations  for  black  (black,  "B").  Thus,  in 
general,  for  the  linear  decomposition  technique,  the  equations  for  each  ethnic-racial  group  j  could  be 
expressed as follows:  

, 

e 

                                                                                                (2) 

where, 

 represents the matrix of average characteristics for each group j; the 

s refer to the partial 

coefficients of the variables, revealing the return to this set of characteristics; 

 is the average predicted 

value of the dependent  variable  for individuals of each  population  group;  and, finally, 
counterfactual mean of these explanatory variables for blacks. 

estimates the 

                                                 
13  With  the  impetus  to  test  and  prove  the  efficient  adequacy  of  the  two  proposed  econometric  models  -  whether  in  terms  of 
robustness, or in relation to non-omission of relevant variables -, the estimation/competition between probit and logit nonlinear 
decomposition models is proceeded. 
14  In  this  study,  the  “yellow/asians"  and  “indigenous"  are  disregarded,  according  to  the  understanding  that  their  inclusion 
would cause a possible bias. Each of these groups has characteristics that are significantly different in relation to the groups in 
which they are inserted. 
15 The authors argue that the inclusion of a set of socioeconomic variables and identification of the Federative Unit  mitigate 
possible  problems  associated  to  the  bias  caused  by  the  omission  of  variables  highly  correlated  to  the  variable  referring  to 
race/color. 
16  It  should  be  emphasized  that  all  variables  -  explanatory  and  dependent  -  are  constructed  according  to  a  methodology 
proposed by França, Duenhas and Gonçalves (2014), Souza and Cunha (2015) and Cerqueira and Coelho (2017). 
17 Used only in the estimation of the model related to physical assault. 
18  In  the  salary  model  proposed  by  Jacob  Mincer  (1974),  the  mincerian  equation  of  wage  determination  corresponds  to  a 
structure used to estimate returns with education and experience.

expressed as: 

                                                                                         (3) 

However,  according  to  Yun's  (2004)  adaptation,  due  to  the  binary  character  of  the  variables  of

,  and  assuming  that 

interest  -  where  the 

distribution  function  (CDF)  -,  the  discrimination  component,  expressed  by  homicides  and  physical 
assault, is estimated at the national level, by the following nonlinear decomposition: 

                                     (4) 

where, 

and 

                                           (5) 

Note  that,  in  both  (3)  and  (4),  the  left  side  of  equality  shows  the  total  difference  and  the  right  side 

indicates  the  sum  of  the  price-effect  -  or  the  portion  of  the  difference  between  the
s  -  with  the 
characteristic-effect - or the portion of the difference derived from the difference between the explanatory 
) variables. According to the literature, the price-effect corresponds to the discrimination component. 
(
 
The decomposition technique developed by Yun (2004) seeks to correctly weigh the contribution 
of  each  explanatory  variable  to  the  characteristic  and  price  effects,  represented  in  the  above  equation, 
.  And,  to  obtain  an  adequate  weight,  the  author  proposes  two  types  of 
respectively,  by 

  and 

approximation:  (i) to  evaluate the value of the function using the average of the characteristics; and (ii) 

applying a first-order Taylor expansion to linearize the characteristic and price effects around 

 and 

, respectively (YUN, 2004). 
 
In  order  to  show  the  participation  of  each  specific  set  of  characteristics  -  individual, 
socioeconomic  and  place  of  residence  -  to  explain  the  discriminatory  phenomenon  under  consideration, 
the explanatory variables were grouped in  their respective blocks of attributes for the application of the

The databases required  for this  purpose are:  (i) for the  analysis of homicides19, according to the 
methodology  developed  by  Cerqueira  and  Moura  (2013b)20,  the  set  of  information  on  all individuals  of 
interest,  selected  by  the  PNAD,  data  set  for  2009,  were  combined  with  mortality  data  collected  in  the 
Mortality  Information  System  (SIM/MS/SVS/DATASUS)21,  for  the  same  period  of  the  PNAD;  on  the 
other hand, (ii) the analysis of physical assault uses the PNAD (2009). 

3.2.1.  Victims of homicidal violence 

The  homicide  database  is  a  probabilistic  sample representative  of  the  Brazilian  population,  aged 
15 years or older, for the period between September/2008 and September/2009. Composed by the PNAD 
(2009)  information  set,  combined  with  mortality  data  collected  in  the  SIM/DATASUS,  with  the  time 
frame  in  correspondence  to  the  aforementioned  edition  of  the  PNAD,  all  observations  related  to 

                                                 
19 The construction of the homicide variable will be based on the conjunction of the categories of deaths related to aggressions 
(X85-Y09) and legal interventions/war operations (Y35-Y36), based on the methodology proposed by Cerqueira and Coelho 
(2017). 
20 This same methodology was also adopted and widely applied in studies developed by Cerqueira and Coelho (2015, 2017).

PNAD  (2009), maintained their respective weights,  established by specific methodology. Therefore, the 
resulting database  contains 350,425 observations, which with the sample weights represent 147,061,444 
individuals of the Brazilian population for the period of analysis. 

Table  1  summarizes  the  descriptive  statistics  -  based  on  the  means  of  the  variables  used  in  this 
survey - of the population of interest, revealing the proportion of each category in relation to the total of 
the  sample  used.  It  is  noteworthy  that  49,630  (0.03%)  individuals  of  this  population  were  victims  of 
homicidal violence in the period in question. Now, focusing on the population groups of blacks and non-
blacks  -  even  in  Table  1  -  it  can  be  observed  that,  while  the  black  population  generally  represents  just 
over  half  of  the  Brazilian  citizens  (approximately  50.27%),  they  are  underrepresented  in  the  strata  of 
higher  education,  and  suffer  a  higher  prevalence  of  lethal  violence,  32,483  homicides  of  blacks  - 
corresponding to a rate of 0.04% of this population - compared to 14,532 (0.02%) among whites, in 2009. 
The  black  population  also  has  a  higher  proportion  of  single,  with  a  younger  profile  and  lower  life 
expectancy - in the age group of 60 years or more, a representativity of 16.81% is observed for whites, in 
contrast to only 12.97% among blacks.

3.2.2.  Victims of physical assault 

On the other hand, the data on physical assault were extracted from PNAD (2009), constituting a 
probabilistic  sample  that  represents  the  Brazilian  population,  aged  10  years  or  more,  for  the  period 
between  September/2008  and  September/2009;  in  addition,  all  observations  maintained  their  respective 
weights,  according  to  the  methodology  adopted  by  IBGE.  Therefore,  the  resulting  database  contains 
337,510  observations  that,  according  to  the  sample  weights,  represent  164,640,165  individuals  of  the 
Brazilian population for the time frame analyzed. 

Table 2 compiles the descriptive statistics of the population of interest, revealing the proportion of 
each  category  in  relation  to  the  full  sample.  It  is  observed  that  of  this  population,  2,549,827  (1.55%) 
individuals  became  victims  of  physical  assault  during  the  study  period.  Focusing  on  the  population

groups  of  blacks  and  non-blacks  -  also  in  Table  2  -  it  is  observed  that,  while  more  than  half  of  the 
Brazilian citizens are self-declared blacks (around 51.04%), they are overrepresented in the lower levels 
of education and income, suffering higher prevalence of physical assault, revealing that 1,488,691 blacks 
- a rate of 1.79% of this group - reported having experienced this type of violence, contrasting with the 
report of 1,041,719 white individuals (1.30%) in the same period. In a similar way, to the study case for 
homicides,  with  the  same  time  frame,  it  is  emphasized  that  the  black  population  has  a  younger  profile, 
with lower life expectancy and higher proportion of singles.

4.1. Adjustment estimation and efficient adaptation of the models 

Tables 3 and 4 present the estimated coefficients in terms of marginal effects - estimation (2), for 
the  probit  model,  and  estimation  (5)  for  the  logit  model,  and  the  robust  standard-errors  associated  in 
parentheses,  respectively,  for  homicides  and  physical  assault.  Note  that,  in  both  models,  there  is  a  high 
statistical  significance  for  the  majority  of  the  parameters;  besides  observing  the  correct  adjustment  of 
these,  according  to  the  LR  (Maximum  Likelihood  Ratio)  test.  However,  in  relation  to  the  partial 
coefficients - more realistic, because they are more smoothed in terms of impact for the logit models - and 

                                                 
22 It should be emphasized that all the models proposed in this methodological section were also estimated without assigning 
the respective sample weights, attesting to the consistency of the results obtained; moreover, the correlation matrix between the 
explanatory variables ensures the absence of multicollinearity for all the estimated models. 

8 

 

for the robust standard-errors - relatively higher in probit estimations - the logit regressions prove to be 
better  adjusted  and  efficiently  the  most  appropriate,  comparatively,  the  probit  regressions  for  both 
dependent variables under consideration.  

Otherwise,  the  model  adjustment  tests  also  attest  to  the  preference  for  the  logit  model  for 
homicides  and  physical  assault,  due  to:  (i)  McFadden's23  Pseudo-R²  higher  value  -  -  even  if  only  for 
homicides,  in  equality  for  physical  assault  -;  (ii)  higher  proportion  of  correctly  predicted  observations  - 
superior  to  homicides,  and  equal  to  physical  assault;  and,  (iii)  lower  value  for  the  Akaike  Information 
Criterion (AIC*), for both dependent variables. 

Moreover,  according  to  Pohlman  and  Leitner  (2003),  the  logit  regressions  prove  to  be  better 
adjusted  and  efficiently  the  most  appropriate  for  the  analysis  in  question,  compared  to  the  probit 
regressions,  due  to  the  characteristic  of  the  logistic  cumulative  distribution,  with  slightly  heavier  tails  - 
smoothing  the  variations  of  the  estimated  partial  coefficients  -,  besides  the  relative  mathematical 
simplicity characteristic to the logit models. 

The  analysis  of  the  partial  coefficients  estimated  by  the  logit  model  -  Table  3  -  for  homicides 
shows that: (i) in relation to the block of individual characteristics, white, female and married individuals, 
in general, are less likely to suffer this type of violence, compared to the respective base-categories under 
consideration,  and  the  probability  of  suffering  homicide  increases  with  age,  reaching  the  peak  in  the 
group between 18 and 24 years, gradually reducing since then; (ii) regarding the block of socioeconomic 
attributes, it is observed that individuals with a higher education level are exposed to a lower probability 
of  suffering  lethal  violence.  These  results  confirm,  not  only  the  descriptive  statistics  proposed  by 
Waiselfisz  (2015)  and  Cerqueira  et  al.  (2018),  but  also  the  empirical  results  obtained  by  Cerqueira  and 
Moura (2013b) and Cerqueira and Coelho (2017).

Complementarily,  Figure  1  presents  the  estimated  probability  distributions24  -  by  applying  the 
logit model - of suffering homicidal violence, according to age and educational level, for both population 
groups. It is observed in Part A that in the age group corresponding to the youth (between 15 and 29 years 
of age) there is an intensification of the mortality differential between blacks and non-blacks; and at the 
apex  of  lethality  for  both  groups  at  age  of  20,  the  probability  of  blacks  becoming  victims  exceeds  by 
approximately  164%  to  the  non-blacks.  In  Part  B,  it  is  noted  that  the  mortality  differential  between  the 
groups is higher, precisely in the educational segment that concentrates the victimization, for individuals 
with up to seven years of study.

Note: In Part A only the interval between 15-91 years is considered, due to the high incidence of missing values in the higher 
age groups. 

 

The partial coefficients estimated by the logit model for physical assault - Table 4 -, similarly to 
homicides, reveal that: (i) in relation to the block of individual characteristics; white, female and married 
individuals,  in  general,  are  less  likely  to  suffer  this  type  of  violence,  compared  to  the  respective  base-
categories under evaluation, and the probability of suffering physical assault increases with age, reaching 
the apex in  the group between 18 and 24  years of age,  gradually reducing since then; (ii) regarding the 

                                                 
24 Figure 1 relates in a two-dimensional way the ethnic-racial identity of homicide victims with their age and educational level. 
A  more  appropriate  and  robust  econometric  analysis  should  jointly  consider  other  socioeconomic  dimensions  and  attributes 
that affect, directly and/or indirectly, the probability of individuals becoming victims of homicide (CERQUEIRA; COELHO, 
2015),  which  is  rightly  proposed  by  the  methodological  approach  in  this  study.  The  option  to  express  the  age  variable  in 
continuous  form,  in  the  logit  regression  (Figure  1),  aims  to  externally  point  out  the  estimated  probability  distribution  of 
suffering homicidal violence.

socioeconomic  attributes  block,  it  can  be  observed  that  individuals  with  higher  education  and  income 
levels are exposed to lower probabilities of physical assault. In this case, as for homicides, the results of 
the  estimated  model  also  confirm,  not  only  the  descriptive  statistics  proposed  by  Waiselfisz  (2015)  and 
Cerqueira  et al. (2018),  but  also  the empirical  results obtained by Cerqueira and Moura (2013b),  Souza 
and Cunha (2015) and Cerqueira and Coelho (2017).

Extending  the  results  obtained  in  the  probit  and  logit  models,  Figure  2  shows  the  estimated 
probability  distributions25  -  through  logit  regression  -  of  suffering  physical  assault  according  to  age, 
educational level and income, for blacks and whites. Also in Figure 2, Part A, it is noted that in the age 
group  between  25-39  years  of  age  the  differential  of  victimization  among  the  population  groups  is 
intensified;  and  at  the  apex  of  the  aggressions  on  both  groups,  between  18-24  years,  the  probability  of 
blacks becoming victims exceeds by approximately 28% to the non-blacks. In Part B, it can be observed 
that  the  differential  of  victimization  by  aggressions  between  the  groups  is  higher,  precisely  in  the 
educational segment that concentrates the victimization, for individuals with up to seven years of study. 
Finally, with regard to income, although the aggressions on the Brazilian population are concentrated on 
the  segment  of  up  to  half  a  minimum  wage,  it  is  verified  that  the  greater  amplitude  between  the 
population groups occurs for individuals who earn between two and fice minimum wages (Figure 2, Part 
C).

25  Figure  2  relates  in  a  two-dimensional  way  the  ethnic-racial  identity  of  the  victims  of  physical  assault  with  their  age, 
educational  level  and  budget  allocation.  A  more  appropriate  and  robust  econometric  analysis  should  jointly  consider  other 
socioeconomic dimensions and attributes that affect, directly and/or indirectly, the probability of individuals becoming victims 
of  violence  against  physical  integrity  (CERQUEIRA;  COELHO,  2015),  which  is  rightly  proposed  by  the  methodological 
approach of this study.

4.2. Decomposing the differential of victimization between blacks and non-blacks 

Having  set  the most  adequate and  efficient models  for both  explained variables  - homicides  and 
physical  assault  -  the  second  phase  of  the  proposed  methodology  follows  the  decomposition26  of  the 
characteristic  and  price  (or  discriminatory  component)  effects,  through  the  application  of  the  Oaxaca-
Blinder technique. 

Table 5 presents the results of the effects decomposition, characteristic (“explained” portion) and 
price  (“unexplained”  portion),  at  the  national  level,  for  homicides  and  physical  assault.  Note  that  the 
Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition presents high statistical significance for all partial coefficients estimated.

Note:  Robust  standard-errors  in  parentheses,  and  adjusted  for  27  clusters  (at  Federative  Unit  level).  ***Significant  at  1%; 
**Significant  at  5%;  *Significant  at  10%.  Regarding  the  blocks  of  characteristics,  the  categories  omitted  were,  respectively: 
age (60 years or more); income per capita (up to 1/2 MW), only in the estimation for physical assault; education (8-11 years); 
and the Northeast region (for homicide) and the North region (for physical assault). 

The  analysis  of  the  estimated  parameters  associated  with  the  decomposition  for  both  dependent 
variables - still in Table 5 - shows that: (i) the differential, at the national level weighted by the respective 
population  groups,  is  positive,  with  the  probability  of  victimization  for  blacks  (group  1)  surpassing  in 
129% the probability for non-blacks (group 2) in the case of homicides, and in 42% in case of physical 
assault,  demonstrating  the  relative  concentration  of  the  victimization  process  on  the  black  population, 
                                                 
26  Estimates  for  homicides  and  physical  assault  without  sample  weights  attest  to  the  consistency  of  the  partial  coefficients 
obtained by this study.

considering,  in  addition,  all  three  blocks  of  characteristics  (individual,  socioeconomic  and  place  of 
residence) previously presented; (ii) it is also noted that this differential, in general, is equally distributed 
between  the  characteristic  and  price  effects;  (iii)  with  respect  to  the  characteristic-effect,  it  is  observed 
that  individual  and  socioeconomic  attributes  infer  greater  relative  weight  in  its  composition;  lastly,  (iv) 
the higher participation of the price-effect - due to unobservable (subjective) effects -, in the composition 
of the differential between both groups, raises strong evidence regarding racial discrimination, expressed 
here  by  its  violent  character.  Results,  which  corroborate,  not  only  the  descriptive  statistics  proposed  by 
Waiselfisz  (2015)  and  Cerqueira  et  al.  (2018),  but  also  the  empirical  results  obtained  by  Cerqueira  and 
Moura (2013b), Souza and Cunha (2015) and Cerqueira and Coelho (2017). 

Table  6  presents  the  results  of  the  decomposition  for  homicides  among  the  population  groups  - 
and  even  between  price  and  characteristic  effects  -  for  each  geographic  region  of  Brazil.  Statistically 
significant  -  at  1%  -  this  differential  was  not  statistically  significant  only  in  the  southern  region,  for 
which, on average, there are relatively close probabilities of suffering homicidal violence between blacks 
and non-blacks. It is also observed that this differential is more intense in the northern region, passing to 
the  northeastern  and  midwestern  regions,  to  the  situation  of  the  lower  differential  in  the  southeastern 
region (Figure 3, Part A).

Finally,  by  focusing  on  the  particular  spatial  dynamics  of  the  price-effect,  Figure  3  -  Part  B27  - 
reveals that the discriminatory racial phenomenon emanating from lethal violence intensifies as it moves 
from  the  Midwest  and  North  towards  the  states  in  the  Northeast  region  of  the  country.  Moreover,  this 
approach, based on previous analyses, corroborates the reality widely discussed in the literature specific 
to the topic of racial discrimination in Brazil. 

Figure  3  -  Distribution  analysis  of  the  differential  of  probability  of  suffering  homicide  between  blacks  and  non-blacks  and

Table 7 shows the results of the decomposition for physical assault among the population groups, 
as well as the participation of the price and characteristic effects, for each Brazilian region. It is observed 
that, statistically significant - at least 5% - this differential is more intense in the southern region, passing, 
in sequence, to the Midwest, Southeast and Northeast regions, to the situation of the lower differential in 
the North region (Figure 4, Part A).

region, the states of Amapá, Rio Grande do Norte, Goiás, Espírito Santo and Paraná. 

Specifically with respect to the price-effect, Figure 4 - Part B28 -, although only significant for two 
Brazilian regions, it is noted that the spatial dynamics for discriminatory racial phenomenon expressed by 
physical assault reveals a tendency to deepen while the analysis is directed from the southeastern region 
to the states of the northern region of the country. As a complement, this analysis is incorporated to the 
previous  approaches,  proving  the  scenario  problematized  by  specific  research  to  the  theme  of  racial 
discrimination in Brazil.

composition of the differential of probability of suffering physical assault between blacks and non-blacks.

5.  Concluding remarks 

This  work  was  motivated  by  the  impetus  to  understand  how  ethnic-racial  identity  affects 
differently  the  victimization  by  physical  assault  and  homicides  in  contemporary  Brazil.  Due  to  the 
unavailability  of  more  recent  information  on  the  issue  of  physical  assault,  in  addition  to  maintaining  a 
temporally  appropriate  treatment  for  the  phenomenon  of  victimization  due  to  violence  against  physical 
integrity,  the  year  of  2009  was  analyzed  for  both  variables,  combining  information  from  PNAD  (2009) 
with  data  on  violent  mortality  from  the  Mortality  Information  System  (SIM/DATASUS),  with  the  time 
frame in correspondence to the aforementioned edition of the PNAD. 

The  theoretical  approach  was  necessary  to  support  the  understanding  of  the  context  of  social 
inequalities  that  are  perpetuated  in  the  Brazilian  society  even  today,  as  a  direct  consequence  of  the 
inexistence  of  solid  mechanisms  -  social,  political  and  economic  -  to  ensure  the  civil  rights.  Revealing 
that  these  inequalities  are  concentrated  on  the  black  population,  being  this  overrepresented  in  the 
segments of lower education and income; in addition, they are more vulnerable to situations of physical 
violence  and  even  lethal  violence.  This  scenario,  therefore,  makes  it  inevitable  and  even  necessary  to 
challenge the veracity of a nation founded on principles of a racial democracy. 

Through  the  proposed  econometric  procedures,  the  severity  of  this  discriminatory  racial  reality 
could  be  verified,  proving  that:  (i)  besides  the  existence  of  a  profound  difference  in  the  probability  of 
victimization,  whether  by  homicidal  violence  or  physical  assault,  between  blacks  and  non-blacks  in 
Brazil; (ii) there is an intense participation, in the composition of this differential between the two groups 
-  for  the  two  variables  under  consideration  -,  of  an  “unexplained”  component  -  or  price-effect  -  by  the 
observable  characteristics  inserted  in  the  model  and,  therefore,  it  suggests  strong  evidence  on  the 
presence,  at  the  national  level,  of  a  discriminatory  racial  character  in  the  social  relations,  constituting, 
according to the literature, a direct channel of concentration of victimization on the black population; (iii) 
on the other hand, in relation to the “explained” component of this victimization differential between the 
groups, the presence of socioeconomic factors stands out  for both variables of violence against physical 
integrity,  constituting  an  indirect  reproduction  channel  of  this  scenario;  (iv)  and,  as  a  complement,  it  is 
observed that this discriminatory phenomenon reveals tendencies to deepen  while the analysis moves to 
the northern and northeastern regions of the country.

Conclusively,  this  scenario,  expressed  by  the  concentration  of  victimization  -  both  by  physical 
assault  and  by  homicidal  violence  -  on  the  black  population  of  the  Brazilian  society,  allows  for  the 
extrapolation of this discriminatory condition for other social relations. In other words, once it has been 
established  that  at  the  limit  of  human  civilization,  according  to  the  scenario  of  violence  and  even 
homicidal mortality, there is evidence of racial discrimination, the apprehension about the socioeconomic 
channels  of  reproduction  of  this  phenomenon  reveals  its  implicit  diffusion,  as  approached  by  literature, 
through the educational, labor and institutional spheres more broadly. 

However, this study and consequent analyses do not exhaust this complex scenario. This research 
only gives a new perspective, trying to keep this discussion fundamentally necessary for the construction 
of a more inclusive and democratic society. For this reason, it is understood that only the full guarantee of 
the democratic rights - among them, especially the right to life - in a society called egalitarian will only be 
achieved  through  the  complete  promotion  of  universal  social  aspects  such  as  a  qualitative  education, 
equity in working conditions, access to housing structure, etc. For this purpose, the state vanguard in the 
planning and implementation of public policies is necessary. 

The achievement of these basic civil  and socio-economic conditions, constitutionally established 
in our Magna Carta - the “Citizen” Constitution of 1988 - and democratically necessary, are presented as 
minimum prerequisites for achieving the national development project - of building a democratic nation - 
sustainable  and  sustained,  in  line  with  the  civilizing  social  aspects  of  the  most  virtuous  and  prosperous 
societies.
