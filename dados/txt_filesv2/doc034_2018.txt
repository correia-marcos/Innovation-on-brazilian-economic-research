Abstract

We analyzed the effects of inﬂation targeting (IT) implementation and functioning through the reaction
function of monetary authorities from Latin American inﬂation targeters (ITers), e.g., Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Mexico and Peru. We adapted the Value-at-Risk and CoVaR to the Inﬂation-at-Risk (IaR)
and Co-Inﬂation-at-Risk (CoIaR), respectively, to estimate the inﬂation at the extremes of its probability
density functions. The results suggested that the IT was able to reduce inﬂation risk for all ITers. Chile
and Peru are further ahead in terms of inﬂationary control, whereas in Brazil, it is more difﬁcult. We
propose the IaR and CoIaR as additional risk-management tools.

1 Introduction

Macroeconomic policies, a subject of interest for academics and policymakers, are deﬁned by the set of
objectives and goals. They cover multiples elements and institutional framework in order to ﬁnd a sustainable
economic path. In this manner, an adequate economic policies framework must satisfy two fundamental
conditions, which are consistency among operational goals and sustainability of long-term economic growth.
Hence, policy makers should undertake macroeconomic and risk management policies, considering domestic
economic issues from a global perspective (Montinari and Stracca, 2016). Among their most important
decisions, inﬂation control and maintaining a stable inﬂationary dynamic are widely investigated.

The inﬂation targeting (IT) regime, for instance, consists of a management system to control inﬂation,
mainly using the basic interest rate as the instrument. (Ardakani et al., 2018) observed that 27 countries,
including both developed and developing countries, have adopted IT, i.e., have become inﬂation targeters
(ITers). The adoption of this regime by some Latin American (LA) countries, e.g., Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Mexico and Peru, has brought current inﬂation below two-digit levels, although it should be noted that for
some of these ITers, there are still periods of high price level acceleration. Thus, (Kim, 2008) state that some
aspects of the macroeconomic tripod must be considered to increase monetary management accuracy.

Whereas (Hall and Jaaskela, 2011), (Thornton, 2016) and (Ardakani et al., 2018) found no signiﬁcant
difference in terms of the inﬂation average and inﬂation volatility between ITers and non-ITers, (Carrasco
and Ferreiro, 2014), (Sayari and Lajnaf, 2017), (Kose et al., 2018) and (Glenn et al., 2018) concluded that
ITers experienced greater inﬂation decreases. However, their outcome was associated with increased inﬂation
volatility, possibly as a consequence of the constrained ﬂexibility of IT to accommodate adverse shocks. On
the other hand, the monetary authorities’ asymmetry preferences in ITers’ countries have been reported by
several studies (Svensson, 2003, 2008; Eyzaguirre, 1998; Gonzalez and Gonzalez-Garcia, 2006; Cukierman
and Muscatelli, 2008; Sweidan, 2008; Strachman, 2013; Aragon and Medeiros, 2015). Nonetheless, since
the early contributions of (Phillips, 1958), (Friedman, 1968) and (Phelps, 1967), few studies have provided
evidence about extreme inﬂation values, volatility and its implications (Kim and Lin, 2012; Hossain, 2014;
Rizvi et al., 2014; Barugahara, 2015; Eisenstat and Strachan, 2016).

In this sense, the main goal of this research is to evaluate the effects of IT implementation and functioning
of selected ITers in terms of evidence of inﬂation risk and the monetary authorities’ role under extreme
conditions. Institutionally, the IT regime is only feasible with independence of the monetary authorities–in
most cases, central banks. This means that ITers can decrease local inﬂation rates and make them less
susceptible to political cycles. Rather than using the ordinary inﬂation volatility, we provide empirical
evidence of the extreme inﬂation risk measures based on the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Co-VaR. The VaR is a
measure of the risk of loss for investments. Statistically, it represents the minimum or the maximum event
observed associated with a probability of occurrence over a speciﬁc time frame. The CoVaR, developed by
(Adrian and Brunnermeier, 2016), was adapted based on the Inﬂation-at-Risk (IaR) (Santos et al., 2010),
following the bivariate speciﬁcation of (Taylor, 1993).

Hence, the Co-Inﬂation-at-Risk (CoIaR) refers to the degree of effort (interest rate) required of the
monetary policy maker to control the inﬂation under distress conditions, i.e., periods of extreme acceleration
of inﬂation. This alternative framework based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) (Embrechts et al., 1997) can
estimate the risk associated with inﬂationary control for different quantiles, and for this reason, it can be
more informative than other measures. Our main concern about extreme events, which are quite common in
ﬁnancial markets, implies that it is useful to investigate how the monetary policy makers of LA ITers behave
under distress conditions. Such conditions could emerge from a lack of monetary-ﬁscal policy coordination
(Dungey and Fry, 2009; Fragetta and Kirsanova, 2010; Davig and Leeper, 2011; Cebi, 2012; Cevik et al.,
2014; Cazacu, 2015; Kliem et al., 2016; Jawadi et al., 2016), which usually impacts price acceleration.

This study is divided into ﬁve sections in addition to this brief introduction. section 2 emphasizes the
effort of the LA ITers to control inﬂation and different stages of countries concerning this task. section 3
presents the econometric methods used in the estimations. section 4 provides information about how the
data were prepared for analysis. section 5 addresses the estimated inﬂation risk measures. Finally, section 6
highlights the ﬁnal conclusions.

2 Inﬂation and the IT regime in Latin America

The LA economy relies on the exportation of commodities from agricultural and mineral products, which
are exported mainly to Europe, the United States of America (US) and China. Otherwise, the volume of trade
between the LA countries is relatively low, especially due to the concentration in the roll of tradable products
of the bloc, with low aggregate values. For this reason, institutional aspects make them risky in terms
of investments. Another factor that generates restrictions on the economic development and commercial
integration of LA countries is the lack of multimodal transportation and other infrastructure problems.
Despite all these restrictions, trade between LA countries has been increasing over the years, being mainly
inﬂuenced by the Common Market of the Southern Cone (Mercosur). It was established by the Treaty of
Asunción between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay on March 26, 1991.

Argentina, an important member state of Mercosur, entered into default in 2001 on about US$24 billion

2

in international debts. After a long term under the rule of the Kirchner family (2003-2015), the country is
still recovering in terms of several of its economic indicators. In 2016, the country had an inﬂation rate of
40%, similarly high interest rates and a high degree of dollarization. Furthermore, the Argentinian industry,
which is concentrated in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Rosario, is still a great concern since
almost two decades have passed with little progress being achieved. In this direction, inﬂation control is an
important means to advance in terms of creating the necessary conditions to facilitate regional economic
development, since Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Mexico together account for approximately 70% of
the region’s GDP (World Bank, 2017).

Thus, we analyzed the LA countries that have adopted IT, rather than sample the current member states
of Mercosur, which include Argentina, Bolivia and Venezuela. This last country is facing a deep crisis: 1) its
economy shrank by 10% in 2016; 2) inﬂation is estimated to be greater than 13,000% this year according
to the IMF; 3) forecasts indicate that by 2018, the GDP will be 3/4 of what it was in 2013; and 4) as a
consequence of this severe scenario, more than 1 million Venezuelans have left the country. This situation
represents one of the larger refugee crisis worldwide. Brazil also faces political turbulence; e.g., in less
than 30 years, two presidents were impeached as result of corruption. As stated by (Winter, 2008), the LA
political scenario has deteriorated as whole, considering the strong interference of presidentialist regimes
with the economic policies of the region, which is susceptible to populist regimes (Castro and Ronci, 1991).
Given the devastating effects of such populist policies on inﬂation, inﬂation control proves to be one of
the main conditions for LA’s development. In empirical terms, inefﬁcient policies manifest in the form of
clusters of volatility in exchange rates and inﬂation, which negatively impact expectations, thus making it
difﬁcult for monetary policy makers to smooth its collateral effects on the level of economic activity. From
an international perspective, the challenges have increased in the aftermath of the crisis of 2008. Unlike
the crises that occurred in the 1990s, such as the Mexican crisis in 1995, which generated increases in
international reserves, especially in developing countries, this last crisis has strongly impacted economies
worldwide. Hence, (Coenen et al., 2012) point out that ﬁscal multipliers and public debt sustainability have
again become a focus of discussions regarding optimal economic policies.

Other LA countries also exhibit characteristics of economic dollarization (Herrero and Glockler, 2000;
Berg et al., 2002). Chile and Peru are ahead in terms of institutional development, i.e., the coordination
policy level. The Central Bank of Chile (Banco Central de Chile - BCCh), for example, has been the Chilean
monetary policy maker since its announcement in 1990, with full independence being adopted in September
1999 (Eyzaguirre, 1998; Larraín, 2007). In Peru, which has the lowest inﬂation target among LA ITers, 2%,
the Central Bank (Banco Central de Reserva del Perú - BCRP) is the autonomous monetary policy maker.
The BCRP, founded in 1931, establishes an inﬂation tolerance band between 1% and 3%. Noticeably, beyond
impacting the average inﬂation rate, all these aspects also have deep consequences in terms of the trajectory
of the variance in inﬂation. The greater the variance is, the less efﬁcient the responses of monetary policy
makers to protect the purchasing power of money.

The region faces great costs from (Fischer, 1981; Smal, 1998; Guerron-Quintana, 2011) and implications
of (Fraga et al., 2004) inﬂation, which makes it important to evaluate the IT implementation and estimate
the inﬂation risk. Endogenously, the deep institutional difﬁculties, mainly from ﬁscal and external points of
view (Aizenman et al., 2011; Huang and Yeh, 2017; Soe and Kakinaka, 2018), could be improved by IT
adoption (Hyvonen, 2004; Carrasco and Ferreiro, 2014; Sayari and Lajnaf, 2017; Kose et al., 2018; Glenn
et al., 2018). In terms of game theory, the institutional conﬂicts between policies’ goals and policy makers
could be described by mechanism designs leading to different screening equilibrium. In the IT regime, the
monetary authority’s goal could be expressed by a metric, which express its reaction function in each given
state of the economy. In practice, this regime establishes responsibilities to the monetary and ﬁscal policy
makers.

As underlined by (Bernanke et al., 1999), the mechanism of monetary transmission is characterized by
how the policy maker’s decisions impact inﬂation and also the GDP. In this sense, Taylor’s Rule expresses

3

how the monetary authority decides the interest rate using the expectation of future inﬂation. In addition, it
manages a loss function, which means the side effects of the reaction function on the investments and the
GDP. The ﬁrst function of IT is to coordinate the expectations, especially for the ﬁnancial market, and the
second is a guide to full transparency for the monetary policy management, which depends on the difference
between the actual inﬂation and the established targets. (Lowenkron and Garcia, 2007) evaluates IT as one
of the new consensuses about macroeconomic fundamentals, which establishes that the price stability is a
necessary condition for economic growth.

Among the advantages of the IT, there are the transparency and credibility of monetary policy information
for the economy, e.g., the accountability, ﬂexibility and possibility of monitoring and evaluating the currency
management. The main disadvantages of this regime are related to the variation in inﬂation, its degree of
forecasting, and the deﬁnition and scope of the target, similar to the high degree of exchange rate ﬂexibility
(Arestis and Sawyer, 2003; Fraga et al., 2004). Once the target is established, the monetary policy maker
must accomplish it. In addition, the institutional framework must be able to tolerate external shocks and
establish the correct incentives to minimize them. Figure 1 reports the numerical inﬂation targets in place,
their tolerance bands, and the observed inﬂation before and aftermath the crisis of 2008. The target indicates
yearly inﬂation in the case of Brazil, where the current target has been 4.5% since 2005, and Colombia,
where the target has been 3% since 2010. The situation is similar in Chile and Mexico, where the current
targets have been 3% for approximately two years.

of 2008

Hence, aftermath the crisis of 2008, there was a dispersion and increase in the observed inﬂation in
the sampled ITers in relation to the respective targets. This indicates that with the exception of Peru, all
the studied ITers seems to exhibit changes in preferences of their monetary policy makers. Such changes
may characterize the differences among economic cycles and the degree of inﬂuence of external prices.
In Chile, where there was a inﬂation of 4.5% before the crisis, the average inﬂation increased to 9% after
the crisis. This observation demonstrates that this economy is vulnerable to both imported inﬂation and
deﬂation through tradable goods. We point out that the IT institutional framework attempts to maintain
inﬂation between the tolerance bands. It also avoids deﬂation in order to efﬁciently calibrate the loss function,
smoothing effects on the economic activity and pursuing the inﬂation target.

The symmetric tolerance band indicates that monetary policy makers avoid both inﬂation and deﬂation.
Hence, CoIaR allows for the monetary policy maker to manage the inﬂation risk under extreme conditions by
quantile and its costs in terms of higher interest rates. By using this information to smooth the loss function,
the monetary policy maker could achieve low inﬂation without necessarily conﬂicting with the other policy
instruments. Once inﬂation volatility is asymmetric, the IT plays symmetric tolerance bands. Thus, the
measures of IaR and CoIaR provide us with some advantage, since the parameters are estimated according to
the distributions for each investigated quantile. Consequently, they are obtained using quantile regression
(QR), which was developed by (Koenker and Bassett-Jr., 1978). We also emphasize that the literature about
such metrics (Embrechts et al., 1997) applied in the inﬂationary context is quite limited. In this sense, our
empirical proposition have monetary-policy implications, since it is possible to use such measures in addition
to or even rather than static and symmetric tolerance bands for inﬂation.

3 Methodological procedures

Value-at-Risk (VaR), initially proposed by JP Morgan, is a method for risk estimation used in ﬁnancial
markets (Jorion, 2007). It is an alternative risk estimator that can quantify the volatility among different
quantiles, i.e., from i-th quantile probability distribution functions. Regularly, this framework is used to
represent the expected potential losses associated with stochastic processes during a period of time, according
to the desired probability of occurrence. For a random variable Xt, deﬁne VaRXtq as the value of Xt, such
that the probability of obtaining a value equal to or less than Xt given by q%, i.e., VaRq is described as the
quantile q%, such that

(1)
By assuming VaRq as a positive number when q > 50%, a higher risk is associated with superior VaRq.
The metric called Inﬂation-at-Risk (IaR) is based on the VaR concept but focused on inﬂation analysis in the
following manner:

q ) = q%

Pr(Xt ≤ VaRXt

(2)
in which πt denotes the inﬂation. Intuitively, the IaRπtq indicates the value of πt such that the probability
of obtaining a value equal to or less than πt is given by q%. Furthermore, because Pr(πt ≤ IaRπtq ) is the
cumulative distribution function, F, of the random process πt, one can also write

q ) = q%

Pr(πt ≤ IaRπt

such that solving for IaRπtq results in

F(IaRπt

q ) = q%

IaRπt

q = F−1(q%)

which is also known as the q%-quantile of πt. The regression model for quantile level q% is

(3)

(4)

Qq(yi) = β0(q) + β1(q)xi1 + . . . + βp(q)xip,

(5)
where q denotes the quantile level, Qq(yi) = Qq(Y|X) is the conditional quantile of yi given xip, and the βi(q)
(cid:32)
are estimated by solving the following minimization problem:

In other words, CoVaR j|C(X i

t )

The IaR provides the risk measure of inﬂation, as very ﬁrst estimated in (Santos et al., 2010). Estimation
using quantile regression enables analyzing the stochastic processes studied from different desirable quantiles
q% of the distribution. In this direction, it could be used to evaluate observed events in the tails, i.e., extreme
occurrences (Embrechts et al., 1997). However, IaRq is a univariate metric that does not consider the marginal
impact of the stochastic process j on process i, or vice versa. In this context, (Adrian and Brunnermeier,
2016) argue that the identiﬁcation of the marginal contribution of the risk of j in the stochastic process i
could provide important information. In this context, CoVaR j|C(X i
is deﬁned as the VaR estimation for the
stochastic process j, conditioned by some event C(X i

is implicitly deﬁned by the quantile q% of the conditional probability

From this measure, (Adrian and Brunnermeier, 2016) developed the ∆CoVaR j|i, which can be described as
follows:

ditional value at risk using the ∆CoVaR deﬁnition. As suggested by the aforementioned authors, the
multivariate measure is an estimate of CoVaR using the QR. In the current research, we used a bivariate
functional form based on (Taylor, 1993, 1995) to estimate the marginal effect of interest rates on inﬂation,
but different from other empirical studies, we considered extreme inﬂation occurrences. Deﬁning the interest
rate as (rt) and inﬂation as (πt), the reduced form of Taylor’s Rule that will be estimated for the distribution
extremes may be expressed by the following speciﬁcation:
rt = r + αq(πt − π∗

(9)
in which r denotes the real interest rate, απ is the elasticity of interest rate response with respect to inﬂation
deviations from target, and εt represents the stochastic error term i.i.d(0,1). This empirical evidence is
important in the context of how monetary policy makers face risks in decision making processes; the
speciﬁcation used to estimate the CoIaR (marginal impact of πt over rt) is

t ) + εt

∆CoIaRrt|πt

, VaRrtq is ﬁrst estimated, conditioned to VaRπtq using the QR. Consider the

The QR, a method that was initially proposed by (Koenker and Bassett-Jr., 1978) enables the estimating
of parameters based on the various quantiles of the sample, which include the median itself or any other
desired quantile under analysis. CoIaR is an adapted version of this measure that can be used to estimate
any desirable inﬂation quantile of the distributions. The quantiles of 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% and 95% were
used for our purpose, different from the analysis employed in ﬁnancial markets, which usually consider
the left-hand tail of the distribution, i.e., the return losses in quantiles of 25%, 10%, 5% and 1% of the
distribution; these values cannot not be obtained using the ordinary least squares method (OLS), which
instead provides estimates for the conditional average of the inﬂation. According to (Koenker, 2005), ColaR
lead to a more complete statistical analysis of the stochastic relation between the studied variables.

This method has been used for over the last few years, emerging as an alternative approach for statistical
analysis of data through linear models, expanding toward nonlinear models, hence increasing the capabilities
of the regression methods. (Koenker and Bassett-Jr., 1978) consider that an advantage of using QR rather
than OLS to estimate the median is that the result of it may be more robust in response to outliers, or to
platykurtic distributions, in addition to being related to the absence of distributional assumptions about the
residual term1. There is also a body of literature that uses and evaluates the CoVaR, such as (Lopez-Espinosa
et al., 2012), (Girardi and Ergu, 2013), (Almeida and Frascaroli, 2014), and (Mainik and Schaanning, 2014),
among others. In addition, it is important to analyze the changes in the estimated parameters, e.g., IaR
and CoIaR, and test the results according to the adoption of the IT. In this manner, we used the Chow Test,
developed by (Chow, 1960), which considers the structural changes exogenously determined to represent
structural break points, given by two relevant events: the country’s IT adoption and the ﬁnancial crisis
that started in 2008. Intuitively, this test divides the sample into k subsamples, and then, after performing
individual regressions for each sample division, an F test is performed to test the parameters’ signiﬁcance.
Formally, we have

Qq(yi) = x(cid:48)λ(q)

for n1

Qq(yi) = x(cid:48)γ(q)

for n2

(15)

(16)

Qq(yi) = x(cid:48)β(q)

(17)
where λ(q) and γ(q) are the estimated coefﬁcient vectors for the ﬁrst and second sub-samples (n1 and n2,
respectively) and β(q) is the estimated coefﬁcient vector for the full sample (n = n1 + n2). The parameters
stability Chow Test use the sum of the square of the residuals (SQR) of the different estimated models. The
null hypothesis of the test (H0) is that the parameters are stable, i.e., there is no structural change in the
estimations. The F statistic calculated from the models with the critical value F(k,n1+n2−2.k) is compared.

for n = n1 + n2

Following the differences among economic, political and institutional factors of the LA ITers, the inﬂation
averages and estimated parameters led us to deﬁne three subsets of countries: (a) Chile and Peru, (b) Brazil,
Colombia and Mexico and (c) the non-ITer LA countries. Thus, we considered model (I), speciﬁed using
the whole time frame sample, including the period before and the aftermath of IT adoption, and model
(II), regarding the estimations using the sub-sample after the adoption of IT. Seeking robust results, ﬁrst,
we estimate the inﬂation conditional risk considering contemporaneous relations; this form is denoted
(i). We also estimated a one-period-lagged speciﬁcation between inﬂation and interest rates (ii). This last
speciﬁcation is a typical backward-looking functional form and diverges from the proposition of (Lucas,

1 Se (Lima et al., 2011) for the VaR case.

7

1976). The speciﬁcation tentatives are important to test the effects of the central banks’ reaction function
over time. Robust empirical evidence is also obtained by testing (A) the adoption of the IT regimes and (B)
how the crisis of 2008 impacted on the central banks’ reaction functions. In this sense, to understand those
effects, four other models also with functional forms (i) and (ii) were estimated.

4 Sample Design and Data Processing

The inﬂation and interest monthly data cover the period from January 1994 through April 2016. We used
the software R Statistics, and seeking robustness, the results were controlled from different perspectives. Our
estimations considered the periods of IT adoption to test the effectiveness of IT in terms of reducing the
average inﬂation and the inﬂation risk. Furthermore, we also estimate the IaR for a subset of non-ITer LA
countries. Hence, for counterfactual comparative analysis, we set this group as (c). As pointed out by the
Table 1 and Figure 2, the highest monthly inﬂation rate was registered in Mexico, followed by Colombia and
Brazil, respectively. We observed that inﬂation volatility was highest in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil, in
this order, indicating signiﬁcant variance in the decrease in inﬂation over time.

uncertainties in the political scenario in 2002, the inﬂation volatility decreased and then increased, although
with considerably less variation after 2013. In contrast, in Colombia and Mexico, inﬂation seems to be
stable at more than 1% per month. We also observe an excess of observations in the right-hand tail of the
distribution in Colombian case. This may indicate the persistence of the Colombian central bank to decrease
inﬂation several times to almost zero. On the other hand, Chile and Peru (a) appeared as cases in which
inﬂation averages are lower, 0.32% and 0.33% each, whereas the variance presented values of 0.16 and 0.15,
respectively.

5 Results

Arguments alongside the empirical analysis are divided into the following categories: 1) institutional,
which indicates that political risk are signiﬁcant in some studied ITers, e.g., there are difﬁculties supporting
the central banks’ independent decisions; 2) a univariate measure of the inﬂation risk; 3) the analysis of the
reaction function under distress conditions, provided by the CoIaR; and 4) control variables and speciﬁcation
tests, such as the crisis of 2008 as a proxy of ITers’ external vulnerability to shocks. The IaR estimated
parameters conditioned to different quantiles are highlighted in Table 2.

For the 95% quantile, Mexico and Colombia presented superior values of 2.44% and 1.89%, respectively,
for IaR, higher than the other ITers. This result means that whereas Mexico has a 95% probability of monthly
inﬂation being smaller than 2.44%, Colombia has analogous probability of registering inﬂation less than
1.89%. We ﬁnd that in 13 episodes (≈ 4.85%), the monthly inﬂation exceeded the extreme value estimated by
the IaR. Note that its value is superior to the tolerance band indicated in Figure 1. In contrast, the estimated
IaR values were 1.00% and 1.12% for Chile and Peru, respectively. This group (a) exhibited the lowest
estimated values of inﬂation risk conditioned to the 95% quantile. In other words, the probability of the

9

monthly variation of Chilean inﬂation is less than 1% in 95% of occurrences in our sample. In a similar
situation, Peru presented an IaR95% of approximately 1.12%, in which only 13 observations of monthly
inﬂation were superior or at least equal to the extreme value given by IaR. Different from (Gonçalves and
Salles, 2008), this result suggests a low inﬂation volatility, i.e., low inﬂation risk compared to the subset (b)
and even lower compared to the non-ITer subset (c).

From the perspective of IaR, Brazil is a hybrid case (a-b), relatively close to the subset with the highest
IaRq%, although with a negative trend in long-term inﬂation. This result reﬂects the monthly inﬂation
volatility risk of 1.57% for the quantile of 95%, i.e., lower than the tolerance band of 2%. In addition, the
estimations for the other quantiles were somehow proportional. On average, the Brazilian parameter was
0.78%, also near the values for Mexico and Colombia (c). The only exception occurred for the parameter
in Mexico for the 75% quantile, 0.86%, lower than for Colombia, which registered 0.92%. We also report
that Chile’s effort to keep inﬂation within the tolerance band is higher, with 42 violations, compared to Peru,
with 65 in total. Otherwise, its magnitudes were small, which strongly suggests macroeconomic ﬁne-tuning.
Furthermore, Colombia and Mexico were similar in terms of violation of their targets’ tolerance bands,
despite highlighting some differences between the estimated IaR values. Colombia has higher parameters
for three of the considered quantiles, with the exception of the 95% values. However, in the Mexican case,
there is a signiﬁcant decrease in inﬂation after the adoption of IT, which was observed for all cases. Turning
the analysis to subset (c), it is possible to observe that in general, they have a much higher inﬂation risk,
highlighted by Ecuador, which registered 5.06% inﬂation risk at the 95% quantile, followed by Bolivia and
Uruguay, both with 3.11%. We veriﬁed a signiﬁcant decrease (42.89%) in Ecuador’s IaR between the 95%
and 90% quantiles, reinforcing the idea of high inﬂation volatility risk also indicated by the changes of the
IaR among these quantiles. Finally, Argentina (1.45%) and Paraguay (2.06%) are the non-ITer countries
with the lowest levels of inﬂation risk. However, such cases are not monetary policy ﬁne-tuning due their
magnitudes, as mentioned previously.

Moreover, the results presented by IaR of subset (c) suggest that the lack of solid rules in institutional
response relative to price increases are an open avenue for inﬂation mismanagement. On the other hand, the
results also indicate that countries that are under IT frameworks are more able to control the average inﬂation,

10

in addition to reducing its volatility. In order to empirically test the higher performance of ITer countries in
terms of inﬂation control, we estimate the Chow Test on the IaR parameters, with the breakpoint given by IT
adoption. Table 3 presents the results of the structural changes test. We report signiﬁcant changes in the
IaR parameters after the adoption of IT for all investigated ITers, whereas for all analyzed quantiles, with
the exception of Chile in the 95% and 90% percentiles, it was not possible to reject the null hypothesis of
parameter stability.

The estimations indicated that the IT was successful in the control of inﬂation, an outcome also in line
with (Carrasco and Ferreiro, 2014), (Sayari and Lajnaf, 2017), (Kose et al., 2018) and (Glenn et al., 2018).
The subsequent reductions of inﬂation volatility were, on average, approximately 50%. The three best
performances in terms of inﬂation risk reduction were, in descending order, Mexico, Colombia and Brazil,
from group (b) of ITers. Before IT adoption in Mexico, the IaR parameter was 4.18% at the 95% quantile,
compared with 0.83% in the aftermath of the adoption of IT. Speciﬁcally, Mexico reduced the inﬂation
volatility risk by approximately 75%, whereas Colombia decreased it by approximately 60%; in Brazil, the
inﬂation risk was reduced to half of that observed in the period before IT adoption in 1999.

Regardless, Brazil exhibits the highest IaR, and it holds for all other estimations. In contrast with the
Mexican estimated parameters, these results for Brazil indicated the constrained ﬂexibility reported by
(Gonçalves and Salles, 2008). Such outcomes even suggest that (1) IT seems to be related to institutional
factors, as emphasized by (Emara, 2012) and (Hove et al., 2017); (2) whereas the other studied ITers reduced
the inﬂation target to 3%, Brazil missed this opportunity and kept the target at 4.5% at year. The signiﬁcant
presence of presidentialism in Brazil may have led to a negative impact of the political cycle on economic
decisions, mainly as a consequence of a type of Neo-Populism in the country2. At this stage of the research,
the estimated CoIaR parameters revealed some advantages relative to other multivariate frameworks, in
which parameter estimations are conditioned to inﬂation events’ average values. QR allows for us to estimate
the marginal impact of interest rates on inﬂation, considering different extreme quantiles.

Table 4 and Table 5 illustrate the point that for most part of the investigated ITers and quantiles, the central
banks’ responses are statistically signiﬁcant at 5%. The best speciﬁcation for the central banks’ reaction
functions was (ii), i.e., the backward-looking functional form. The parameters were superior compared to
those estimated in (i), considering contemporary effects between interest rates and inﬂation. Nonetheless,
some of the estimated parameters were not statistically signiﬁcant for both speciﬁcations (i) and (ii). Some

2This so-called Neo-Populism was based on ﬁscal trickeries, i.e., the loss of the macroeconomic tripod, which brought inﬂation

and more than 14 million people unemployed since 2013.

of these outcomes demonstrate that there are distinct levels of efforts by the ITers’ central banks, in addition
to problems due to asymmetric preferences.

Similar to the IaR, the CoIaR could also be a consequence of the small number of observations in each of
the analyzed quantiles. After the studied countries become ITers, this made the analysis difﬁcult, depending
on the extreme right-hand quantile. Independent of the speciﬁcations, the magnitudes of the estimated
∆CoIaR parameters suggested that the central banks usually decide to smooth the interest rate trajectories, as
a consequence of management of the loss function. Apparently, the concave form of their reaction function
reveals less-elastic responses in periods of extreme inﬂation, which may impact its own reputation. For the
Brazilian case, we note that for both (i) and (ii), statistical signiﬁcance of the ∆CoIaR was not veriﬁed. This
outcome indicates the difﬁculty of estimating the reaction function of the central bank, depending on the
extreme quantiles.

Parameters with negative signals in the 95% and 90% quantiles were estimated, considering the mentioned
aspects of their reaction functions’ concavities. This result suggests that the Brazilian central bank does not
exhibit elastic responses to extreme inﬂation, which registered 10.67% in 2015. The monetary policy makers

from the investigated ITers from group (b) are not as independent as necessary for efﬁcient calibration of
Taylor’s Rule and well functioning of the IT regime. The exceptions were Chile and Peru from (a), in which
the volatility was very close to zero, as also estimated by (Larraín, 2007) for the Chilean case. These ITers
do not register statistical signiﬁcance for the ∆CoIaR at the 95%, 90% and 85% quantiles of the distribution,
mainly due to the absence of observations in these quantiles. However, in quantiles 80% and 75%, the
parameters were statistically different from zero. These outcomes indicate that the central banks from (a) are
relatively inﬂuenced by inﬂation’s extreme events. In this case, the inﬂation volatility could be consequence
of the constrained ﬂexibility and external factors, maybe with no elastic responses to interest rates.

Colombia and Mexico from (b) presented parameters with statistically signiﬁcant positive signs, suggest-
ing evidence for central banks’ positive reaction to extreme inﬂation events, even in small-scale terms, i.e.,
ﬁne-tuning. This veriﬁcation suggests that the ITers that made more institutional policy coordination efforts
were able to decrease inﬂation more intensely without necessarily overuse of the interest rates. The Chow
Tests for speciﬁcations (A) and (B), considering (i) and (ii), with the likelihood ratios and F statistics in
brackets, are presented in Table 6 and Table 7, in section 6. It was not possible to reject the H0 hypothesis for
all ITers whose ∆CoIaRChow were denoted by dashes. This ﬁnding means that the F statistic was lower than
the density percentile F(k,n1 + n2− 2k). On the other hand, the values indicated by stars indicate differences
in the parameters estimated; thus, H0 was rejected. For all cases, considering both functional forms, with the
exception of Colombia and Mexico for the highest quantiles, the ∆CoIaRChow parameters were superior for
the subsamples considering the period after IT adoption (A), although, the parameters estimated at quantiles
90% and 95% have negative signs.

For (B), the most affected was Mexico, followed by Chile. With the US as the main trading partner, it is
possible to associate this outcome with imported inﬂation, since the Mexican economy is directly linked
to the international crude oil price variation. Meanwhile, the Chilean inﬂation risk is also vulnerable to
exogenous shocks according to the crisis of 2008 tests. However, Chile faces imported inﬂation through
tradable goods, as also pointed out in (Aizenman et al., 2011; Huang and Yeh, 2017; Soe and Kakinaka,
2018). In other cases, such as Brazil, the structural change was statistically insigniﬁcant. Hence, Brazilian
IT’s framework depends more on structural domestic conditions. According to targets and the averages of
inﬂation displayed in Figure 1, Peru, followed by Chile, Mexico, Colombia and Brazil, in this order, are
likely to be more aligned with the commitments arising from the IT regime.

The IaR and the CoIaR vary considerably depending on the 210 tested speciﬁcations. In general, whereas
Brazil is the lowest-ranked country in terms of efﬁcient IT functioning, Chile and Peru (a) have better
outcomes. The parameters obtained using the functional form (ii) were superior to those resulting from
(i), suggesting that the central banks from studied ITers take a month on average to respond to extreme
inﬂationary episodes. However, the longer it takes the central bank to react to extreme inﬂation, the higher the
costs in terms of interest rates’ elasticity responses. In summary, the results seem to indicate deep differences
among economies and institutional development, mainly among the studied ITers from group (b). This
requires efﬁcient policy coordination with special attention to the independence of central banks. Principles
such as ﬁscal balance, transparency and accountability, in addition to ﬁnancial development (Huang and Yeh,
2017), are among the main conditions for proper functioning of IT.

According to the identiﬁed characteristics, Chile and Peru were better placed in terms of IT functioning,
whereas Mexico and Brazil, in the opposite condition, are still in transition in terms of the regime’s adoption.
In Brazil, the inﬂation and interest rates were consequences of the domestic ﬁscal crisis and the loss of the
macroeconomic tripod. The use of public expenditure to push government’s electoral agenda, mainly during
the period from 2007 to 2012, was the principal source of Brazilian performance. This deteriorated due to
increasing corruption, leading the country to a serious domestic crisis since 2013, as previously mentioned.
As pointed out by (Castro and Ronci, 1991) and (Winter, 2008), the political risk is also one of the great
barriers for the development of LA countries. Therefore, we observed that the management of monetary
instruments is diffuse, as also reported in (Svensson, 2003), (Svensson, 2008), (Arestis and Sawyer, 2003),

13

(Cukierman and Muscatelli, 2008) and (Sweidan, 2008).

6 Conclusion

We analyze the implementation and the functioning of IT, focused on inﬂation, its targets and tolerance
bands, in addition to empirical measures of the inﬂation risk. The IaR and the CoIaR estimated measures for
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru were computed by using historical data combined with theoretical
and institutional factors for this purpose. We also estimated parameters considering the vulnerability to
institutional and external shocks by testing multiple speciﬁcations for inﬂation risks. The results indicated
high numbers of internal uncertainties among the studied ITers, despite the decreased inﬂation, suggesting
that the ITers are in distinct IT development stages.

The alternative measure provided by the IaR and CoIaR based on EVT reinforce the importance of
maintain an orderly process of formation of expectations and prices. First, the IaR outcomes demonstrated
that IT reduced the inﬂation volatility in all of the investigated cases. Furthermore, the CoIaR underlined
that the responses of the ITers’ central banks to extreme inﬂationary events were limited. This may be a
consequence of the preferences of the LA central banks for smoothed interest rates, minimizing, in this
manner, the loss function side effects. Nonetheless, the presented literature and the empirical evidence of
inﬂation risk address the asymmetry of the LA central banks’ preferences, which could be motivated by
the strong presence of presidentialism in the region. In this sense, the diagnosis is quite similar among LA
countries: urgent in-depth reforms toward more accommodative public decision stances, in particular, the
better use of ﬁscal instruments to reduce current distortionary tax effects.

Besides, the intra-regional aspects of LA, the economies’ openness, and the heterogeneity of domestic
interests rates must be considered for coordinated monetary policy decisions. From an institutional point of
view, Chile and Peru are better placed in terms of the performance of inﬂationary control, whereas Mexico
and Brazil are still in transition in terms of the whole implementation of the IT regime. Comparing the IT
beneﬁts and costs between ITers and the other investigated LA countries, the empirical evidence suggests
that it could be a tool to reduce domestic inﬂation and its risks. Hence, as already mentioned, we propose
using such measures, possibly in addition to the static and symmetric tolerance bands for inﬂation in the IT
regime. For future investigations, we indicate the use of CoIaR to provide empirical evidence of inﬂation for
other subsets of ITers and compare it with other inﬂation risk measures.
