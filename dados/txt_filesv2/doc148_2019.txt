ABSTRACT:  This  paper  addresses  commercial  openness  as  a  technology  transfer  channel  using  a 
database for 58 countries over a period of 45 years. It is proposed to identify the impact of openness in 
Total  Factor  Productivity  (TFP)  and  to  verify  if  the  interaction  between  openness  and  internal 
technological efforts impacts productivity. We use a fixed-effect panel model in Instrumental Variables 
(IV).  The  results  suggest  that  TFP  growth  is  not  affected  by  long-term  openness,  although  it  has 
temporary  positive  effects.  For  developing  countries,  openness  negatively  affects  TFP,  even  when 
variation in the degree of openness interacts with internal technological efforts.

RESUMO: Este artigo aborda a abertura comercial como um canal de transferência de tecnologia usando 
um banco de dados para 58 países durante um período de 45 anos. Propõe-se identificar o impacto da 
abertura  na  Produtividade  Total  de  Fatores  (PTF)  e  verificar  se  a  interação  entre  abertura  e  esforços 
tecnológicos  internos  impacta  a  produtividade.  Utilizamos  um  modelo  de  painel  com  efeito  fixo  em 
Variáveis  Instrumentais  (IV).  Os  resultados  sugerem  que  o  crescimento  da  PTF  não  é  afetado  pela 
abertura a longo prazo, embora tenha efeitos positivos temporários. Para os países em desenvolvimento, 
a abertura afeta negativamente a PTF, mesmo quando a variação no grau de abertura interage com os 
esforços tecnológicos internos.

Introduction 

The discussion about the relationship between trade openness and economic growth commonly 
arise both theoretical models and empirical works. That is a classical concern in economic theory and 
currently has become relevant because of the controversial visions on the commercial policy has taken 
place  for  the  global  economy.  More  specifically,  part  of  the  literature  proposes  openness  as  a  factor 
determining productivity. For example, Miller & Upadhyay (2000) found that a country’s openness has 
a significant and robust positive effect on total factor productivity (TFP). Therefore, the question is what 
the  mechanism  to  lead  openness  to  affect  productivity  growth.  To  answers  this,  the  literature  also 
identifies  the  trade  as  a  likely  channel  of  knowledge  diffusion  among  countries  and  consequently 
considering the possibility to be a factor that influences the TFP growth. 
 
The theoretical assumption behind the international trade as a channel of technological diffusion 
is  that  “international  trade  of  tangible  commodities  leads  to  an  exchange  of  intangibles  ideas” 
(GROSSMAN & HELPMAN, 1990), more specifically, these commodities, are understood as capital 
and intermediate goods. As Eaton & Kortum (2001), Grossman & Helpman (1991), and Caselli & Wilson 
(2004) stated, countries with more openness in machinery and equipment imports tend to take advantage 
from external knowledge efforts to improve their growth in total factor productivity (TFP).  

However, there are also opposing visions such as those that empirical findings have shown up to 
now. Theoretical models show ambiguous results between trade openness and growth. For example, there 
is evidence of a positive relationship between both variables along with the idea that learning by doing 
is  a  key  issue  in  the  accumulation  of  human  capital  (LUCAS,  1993).  Furthermore,  a  positive  and 
significant  correlation  has  been  found  between  the  openness  variable  and  long-run  economic  growth 
(ULAȘAN,  2012).    Nonetheless,  another  work  state  that  trade  openness  is  negative  for  developing 
countries because these  countries would produce  goods of a very low learning  rate  (YOUNG,  1991). 
Additionally,  in  other  recent  paper  McMillan,  Rodrik  and  Verduzco-Gallo  (2014)  argue  that  an 
intensified globalization process for developing countries have represented a disadvantage, even more, 
if those countries are revealed with comparatives advantages in natural or primary commodities. They 
explain  that  it  is  due  to  mobility  frictions  on  the  labor  market  founding  evidence  that  workers  have 
dislocated from higher productivity sectors for the lower ones.  
 
Thus,  there  seem  to  be  certain  differences  when  we  refer  to  technology  spillovers  between 
developing and developed countries. Moreover, Xu & Chiang (2005) argue that the literature has focused 
on  industrialized  countries  and  this,  indeed,  represents  a  serious  limitation,  due  to  the  structural 
differences  between  both  types  of  countries.  In  addition,  Ang  &  Madsen  (2013)  state  that  almost  all 
available  studies  on  knowledge  spillovers  have  focused  exclusively  on  the  mature  OECD  countries. 
Hence, it is convenient to identify at least two groups of countries, since results obtained from a sample 
of mature industrialized countries do not necessarily extend to developing ones.  

An important exception is a work by Coe, Helpman, & Hoffmaister (1997), who investigate the 
influence  on  the  productivity  of  knowledge  spillovers  through  the  channel  of  imports  from  OECD 
countries to 77 developing countries. Their study focused mainly on the following aspect: knowledge 
spillovers through the channel of imports from North to South. However, they did not consider the effect 
on  the  productivity  of  domestic  knowledge  in  developing  countries,  international  knowledge 
transmission  through  channels  other  than  imports,  and  knowledge  spillovers  among  developing 
countries. However, there are not many works that consider the fact that openness defined by imports 
plus  exports  to  gross  domestic  product  (as  a  single  variable)  could  have  some  relationship  with  TFP 
growth, in a technology-spillover sense, with exception of Madsen (2009, 2008) that consider openness 
like a determinant of productivity growth, but only for OECD countries. However, this author states that 
the interaction between the propensity to import, understood as openness, and its influence on the growth 
of  research  intensity  in  developing  countries  has  not  been  tested  so  far.  That  is,  it  is  not  clear  what 

 

3 

 
connection this openness holds to a country’s own productivity and technological efforts. Therefore, we 
start from the hypothesis that trade openness might be a channel of knowledge transmission but with the 
purpose of potentiating/optimizing internal efforts to impact on TFP growth. Madsen (2009) also argued 
that one of the main problems faced by developing economies is that they do not yet have the educational 
and research capacity to exploit effectively the technology that has been developed elsewhere. 

Thus, the contribution of this paper is summarized as follow. We associate openness to growth 
considering the possibility that openness is a carrier of technology spillovers. This is the key issue under 
investigation here: finding out the link between these two variables and proving the hypothesis mentioned 
above, proposing to go beyond that countries of OECD limitation, including a sample with developed 
and developing countries to test our hypothesis not just for High-income  countries,  but also for other 
categories of countries by income criteria.  Furthermore, two additional objectives are proposed: first, to 
investigate  the  long-run  and  short-run  effects  of  openness  in  TFP  growth,  using  the  cointegrated 
equations approach. Second,  to  verify  the positive relationship between  foreign  knowledge stock like 
technology  spillover  on  productivity  growth,  for  a  large  sample,  including  developed  and  developing 
countries. In order to answer these questions, we use the knowledge spillovers approach across countries 
using openness as an added variable to pick up the trade relationship degree, beyond the typical spillovers 
variables build from resident patents data. Our results for the short-run analyses show that in general for 
the countries intensify trade relations enhance its productivity in technological terms but in the long-run 
not seems to have a clear link. However, when we able the interaction of openness with domestic patent 
data, it prejudices the internal knowledge productivity, even in the short-run. That finding suggests being 
in line with the capacity to absorption theory, which variance depends on the features of each country in 
terms of economic structure, and cultural or law institutions.  Finally, we find a very strong influence in 
the short-run of imports from more close countries of technological frontier over productivity growth. 
 
The  rest  of  the  paper  is  presented  as  follow:  Information  on  the  database  and  methodological 
issues are presented in Section 2.  The results, discussion, and the sensitivity analysis are carried out in 
Section 3 and 4, respectively. Finally, Section 5 concludes this work. An appendix section is included to 
present the construction of the variables and additional tests for the estimated models.

Data and Methodology  

2.1 Database 
 

The  dataset  covers  the  period  from  1969  to  2014  and  comprehends  58  countries:  Argentina, 
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Switzerland, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Germany,  Denmark,  Dominican  Republic,  Ecuador,  Egypt,  Spain,  Finland,  France,  United  Kingdom, 
Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Honduras, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Iran, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Japan, 
Kenya, Republic of Korea, Morocco, Mexico, Malaysia, Nigeria, Nicaragua, Netherlands, Norway, New 
Zealand,  Panama,  Peru,  Philippines,  Portugal,  Paraguay,  Romania,  Singapore,  Sweden,  Thailand, 
Tunisia, Turkey, Uruguay, United States, Venezuela, and South Africa.  

Data on TFP, GDP, trade and national accounts, and human capital (hc) were obtained from the 
Penn World Table 9.0 (PWT 9.0). Data on patent applications by resident and non-resident were obtained 
from the World Bank (WB) Database, which uses the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) 
as the source. All data but labor – which is measured as an annual average of worked hours by employees 
– are in US$ million at constant 2011 prices and transformed into natural logarithm form (ln), except for 
TFP and openness, which are expressed as indexes. From the previous descriptions, Table 1 specifies the 
variables used in this study, the expected sign and the data source.

2.2 Empirical strategy  
 

The empirical strategy followed in this work is based on the data panel techniques. The estimates 
make through Fixed Effect (FE) or Random Effect (RE).  Furthermore, the Instrumental Variable (IV) is 
used to solve possible endogeneity effects of country productivity on the trade variable. Lastly, estimate 
via robust errors is used to obtain correct standard errors through heteroskedastic panels. 

Based on the specification of Coe & Helpman (1995) and Madsen (2009), the first basic model 

to be estimated is:  

5 

∆(cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) = (cid:11)(cid:12) + (cid:11)(cid:14)
&(cid:8)(cid:9),                                                                                                                                                                                                                       (cid:23)1(cid:25)

(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:25) + (cid:11)(cid:26)

(cid:15)(cid:16)∆(cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:17)(cid:8)(cid:9)

(cid:20)(cid:16)∆(cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:17)(cid:8)(cid:9)

(cid:20)(cid:18) +  (cid:11)(cid:21)

where  tfp  is  total  factor  productivity,  Sd  is  the  domestic  knowledge  capital,  Sf is  the  foreign  stock  of 
knowledge spillovers through the trade channel, O is the level of trade openness, O(Sd) is the interaction 
between openness and domestic knowledge stock, hc is a human capital index, I is a vector of selected 
instrumentals variables, and ε is an error term. ∆ is the first difference operator, the subscripts i and t 
signify country and time, respectively, and β is the respective coefficient.  

The term O(∆ln Sd) is constructed in order to test the hypothesis that openness associated with 
domestic R&D efforts positively affects tfp in the long run. It is expected to be positive if the trade of 
product varieties between advanced and less developed countries improves innovative activities provided 
that the existence of absorptive capacity in less developed countries. The opposite case could be evidence 
for supporting the argument of Rodríguez & Rodrik (2000), who state that the presence of some trade 
barriers may be good for the internal development of knowledge and technology. 

Additionally,  we  also  are  interested  in  observing  the  short-term  effects  of  openness  on 
productivity.  For  this  purpose,  we  include  two  more  variables:  openness  in  first  difference,  ∆O,  and 
interaction with domestic knowledge, ∆O(∆ln Sd). Thus, we have a second equation to estimate:  

∆ ln (cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) = (cid:11)(cid:12) + (cid:11)(cid:14)
&(cid:8)(cid:9),                                                                                                                                                                                                                       (cid:23)2(cid:25)  

(cid:22)(cid:15)(cid:23)∆(cid:24)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:16)∆ ln (cid:27)(cid:8)(cid:9)

(cid:22)(cid:23)∆(cid:24)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:25) + (cid:11)(cid:26)

(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:23)ℎ (cid:25) + (cid:11)!

(cid:15)(cid:16)∆ ln (cid:17)(cid:8)(cid:9)

(cid:15)(cid:18) +  (cid:11)(cid:19)

(cid:15)(cid:18) + (cid:11)(cid:28)

$(cid:23)%(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:25) +

(cid:20)(cid:16)∆ ln (cid:17)(cid:8)(cid:9)

(cid:29)(cid:30)"(cid:23)ℎ (cid:19)(cid:25) + (cid:11)#

(cid:20)(cid:18) +  (cid:11)(cid:21)

Two brief comments are needed at this point. First, it is not possible to include both variables of 
openness in the same equation, for methodological reasons. That is because the estimation would present 
collinearity since we consider openness to be probably endogenous and we use openness lagged and in 
differences as instruments in order to exclude such endogeneity.  

Second, the first difference operator (cid:23)∆) is included to capture the influences of economic cycles. 
About this, the literature in micro studies has generally shown a positive association between increased 
exports and productivity growth. However, the relationship between imports and productivity growth is 
often negative. That observed pattern is likely to be since countries tend to export goods in which they 
have a comparative advantage and to import goods in which they do not, which generates inability to 
distinguish between the expected positive effect of imports on TFP growth in the long run and the fact 
that  imports  are  drawn  to  low  productivity  sectors  where  a  country  does  not  have  an  international 
advantage. In addition, the observed relationships could also be explained by the well-known pro-cyclical 
nature of productivity growth: this tends to be higher when output is growing and falls during recessions 
or low-growth periods. Therefore, if greater import penetration is accompanied by a contraction of the 
domestic  industry,  productivity  growth  is  expected  to  fall  as  well.  This  is  known  as  the  simultaneity 
problem (HARRISON, 1996).  

To solve this issue, some authors, such as Quah & Rauch (1990), use trade shares as a proxy for 
openness to decompose the short- and long-run effects of openness on economic growth and take out the 
trend component of the series. They find that most of the observed positive relationship between openness 

 

6 

 
and growth is due to short-run cyclical fluctuations. Furthermore, the choice of the model makes through 
the Sargan-Hansen test, which is applied by the IV. The null hypothesis  says that the overidentifying 
assumptions are valid. That is, it tests the validity of the used instruments. 

2.3 Descriptive statistics analyses 

The  descriptive  statistical  analysis  of  the  data  is  now  presented.  Table  2  shows  the  mean  and 
standard deviation of the main variables used in the model, organized by a group of countries, and each 
variable  denotes  Domestic  Knowledge  Capital,  Sd
it,  and  Openness, 
Ocit. Moreover, the last column presents the percental distribution of the sample by country category.  

it,  Foreign  Knowledge  Spillover,  Sf

Due  to  characteristic  differences  between  countries,  which  may  affect  the  knowledge 
transmission among developed and developing economies through intermediate varieties imports, we use 
a  classification  suggested  by  Ghimire,  Kapri  &  Rahman  (2018).  According  to  the  World  Bank 
convention, countries with per capita income (in US dollars) below 1,025 are defined as lower-income 
economies, per capita income between 1,025 and 4,035 defines lower-middle-income economies, upper-
middle-income  economies  have  per  capita  income  between  4,035  and  12,475,  and  countries  with  per 
capita income above 12,475 are defined as high-income economies. The correlation matrix (presented in 
the appendix) shows the main variables in this study. We also include the control variable and instruments 
used in section 3. Such variables are explained by solving endogeneity problems of openness. The most 
important object here is to observe any possible collinearity relation between the explanatory variables. 
However, as the table shows, this problem does not seem to exist because the correlation coefficients do 
not exhibit high values. In addition, the correlation coefficient among the explanatory and the explained 
variable, TFP, states how strong the relation between them is. In this case, the Foreign Knowledge Stock, 
Sf, has the strongest correlation, in addition to showing a positive sign, followed by the Unemployment 
Rate Growth and Openness in First Difference, with negative and positive signs, respectively.

Additionally, Figures 1 and 2 show the scatterplot for TFP and Openness. In the first figure, we 
can  observe  a  positive  trend  for  the  annual  average  variation.  However,  there  is  a  clear  presence  of 
outliers in both directions, as the case of Hong Kong or Singapore, which are countries with a very high 
openness volume and, at the same time, increasing productivity rates. In contrast, we find that Iran is in 
a very opposite situation, with a negative productivity growth rate and the lowest rate for openness in the 
sample.  In Figure 2, nevertheless, there seems to be no clear relationship between the TFP annual average 
growth rate and the annual average of the openness level. This could suggest that TFP and Openness are 
more closely linked in the short-run, which is also supported by the coefficient between ∆ln tfp and ∆O 
presented in the correlation matrix.

Estimation Results 
Table  3  shows  the  coefficients  for  the  entire  period  (1969-2014).  The  tests  for  instruments 
overidentification do not reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are exogenous at 10% significance 
level. Openness (O) is measured by import plus export to GDP, the estimated coefficients of this variable 
in  level  are  statistically  insignificant,  except  for  the  estimates  when  the  Openness  Variation  (∆O)  is 

 

7 

 
considered.  In  general,  these  results  suggest  that  openness  has  no  permanent  effects  on  productivity 
growth but may have direct temporary positive effects on growth.  

In  turn,  when  we  analyze  the  interaction  variable,  ∆O*∆ln  Sd,  there  is  a  significant  negative 
coefficient. This result is an interesting finding because, although the openness itself does not seem to be 
clearly related to the growth of productivity, and even the openness change rate is positive and highly 
significant,  it  suggests  that  higher  openness  could  decrease  TFP  even  when  the  domestic  knowledge 
efforts are considered, at least in the short-run. This result is in line with what is suggested by Rodriguez 
and Rodrick (2000). According to these authors, there is a conceptual distinction between quantity and 
quality effects of trade policies on growth. 

That  is,  openness  influences  higher  volume  of  trade,  but  it  does  not  necessarily  improve 
productivity growth in the same sense or directions, because the volume of trade may also be influenced 
by other factors, like changes in world demand or geographical relations, which in turn affect growth. 
Then, when we investigate openness as one possible channel that affects the internal knowledge progress, 
we  find  results  that  suggest  a  negative  link  among  these  variables  in  the  sense  to  affect  productivity. 
Moreover,  this  interaction  term  is  tested  for  different  categories  of  countries,  keeping  the  negative 
relation in Middle and Low-income countries, but only being significant in emerging countries. In High-
income countries, however, the relationship is positive but not significant.  The estimated coefficients of 
Foreign Spillovers (∆lnSf) are consistently positive and highly significant.

Because  ∆lnSf  is  based  on  the  interaction  between  import  penetration  and  foreign  stock  of 
knowledge, this result suggests that openness has temporary growth effects, provided that the country 
trades with countries that have increasing knowledge stocks.  

About  the  control  variables,  we  find  that  the  Human  Capital  is  slightly  significant  and  has  a 
negative link with the growth rate of productivity, but when we take the square of this variable, it appears 
to  be  positively  related  and  significant.  This  implies  that  Human  Capital  (hc)  performs  better  as  a 
quadratic form, that is, the more investment and development in human capital, the more productivity 
grows at a proportionally higher rate. In addition, a set of instrumental variables to openness are involved 
as indicated by the last section. Although most of these variables are not significant, it is important to 
include them in order to solve endogeneity issues.  

Table 4 shows the results for the same regression, for the first half of the period, from 1969 to 
1991. We chose this period because, after it, the global geopolitical order changed due to the fall of the 
Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  (USSR),  which  could  have  affected  the  international  trade  flow. 
Openness, in this case, is significant and positive in relation to productivity growth, whereas its variation 
is mostly positive and  significant. These  results  suggest that openness was important for productivity 
growth  in  this  period,  but  that  the  beneficial  effects  of  openness  come  from  knowledge,  as  is 
demonstrated by the  growth rate of the  Foreign  Spillovers coefficient,  which is positive and strongly 
significant.

Notes: The Hansen J statistic is the overidentification test for all instruments. The following instruments are used for openness: 
the human capital index, the population in logarithmic form, population density, rate of unemployment, changes in the rate of 
unemployment, inflation, and all years’ time dummies. As excluded instruments, we use the first difference of openness and the 
agricultural GDP growth. For these results, we take out China; however, similar results are obtained if China is included in the 
models. 

 

 

Besides, when we observe the interaction between both variables for Openness and the Domestic 
Knowledge Stock, it is positive although not significant, but, if we explore within countries by income 
categories, we find that for it is positive and strongly significant for low-income countries. This suggests 
that openness had positive temporary and permanent effects, along these two decades, on the internal 
efforts of this type of countries.

Finally, consider the results for the last 22 years of the sample in Table 5. The level of Openness 
does  not  have  significance,  but  its  variation  rate  is  strongly  significant  and  positive  in  relation  to 
productivity  growth.  However,  specifically,  when  we  analyze  the  interaction  in  differences  regarding 
knowledge internal efforts, ∆O*∆Sd, it has a negative and significant relation.  

In the estimation, by categories of countries, we can see a positive but not significant relation for 
the High-income countries, while the relation is highly significant but negative for the Emerging-income 
countries. This result suggests that, while openness may have been beneficial for developed countries in 
terms  of  their  knowledge  productivity,  high  degrees  of  openness  does  not  seem  to  be  suitable  for 
developing  emerging  economies.  However,  for  the  rest  of  the  countries  categories,  Middle  and  Low-
income, the coefficients are also negative but do not present significance for the openness-knowledge 
link. In general, this may suggest that, although trade relations among countries have intensified in the 
last two decades in contrast to the estimation of previous years, the result has been positive for developed 
countries as opposed to developing countries, that is, openness has had temporary negative effects for 
the latter along the last two decades.   

For  these  results,  we  can  analyze  that  the  variation  rate  of  the  openness  itself  has  a  direct 
relationship with productivity growth, but when we test this specifically in relation to internal knowledge 
efforts,  the  trade  becomes  a  negative  factor  for  countries’  internal  development  of  knowledge  and 
technology, even more so for developing economies. That may suggest  that  a lower openness degree 
would be good for such economies.  Thus, according to these first results, the hypothesis that trade leads 

 

 
to knowledge spillovers between countries in terms of internal development efforts is only confirmed for 
the High-income category along nearly the last three decades. In contrast, for the rest of the countries 
evaluated in the present study, this hypothesis is not confirmed, because openness is either negative or 
not significant.

Following the seminal work of Coe and Helpman (1995) and the strategy used by Madsen (2009), 
as well as the related empirical literature, we include such interaction term. Coe and Helpman (1995) 
interacted O and ∆lnSf to capture the role of international trade. They reasoned that, although Sf constructs 
by the import-weighted stock of knowledge, these weights are fractions that add up to one and, therefore, 
do not implies necessarily openness. In this study, we use the weights like Lichtenberg and de la Potterie 
(1998) to construct Sf, whose weights do not add up to one, but are influenced by imports. Madsen (2009) 
states  that  the  importance  of  making  the  interaction  between  O  and  lnSf  is  to  investigate  whether 
knowledge spillovers through the openness channel influence growth in a non-linear way.  

The  results  for  this  analysis,  presented  in  Table  6,  show  that  the  estimated  coefficients  of 
∆O*∆lnSf  are  not  significant,  which  suggests  that,  for  most  of  the  countries  in  the  sample,  a  higher 
openness index does not influence the country’s capacity to absorb knowledge. However, the estimated 
coefficients of ∆lnSf keep positive and strongly significative, which suggests that, for these countries, the 
quality  of  their  imports  is  more  important  than  the  openness  degree  of  the  economy.  In  other  words, 
knowledge spillovers are more efficient in improving productivity when imports come from countries 
closer to the technological frontier.  

A second sensitivity test is presented, as suggested by Coe and Helpman (1995). Below, we allow

Table 7 shows the estimated results of this test. Both capital and labor coefficients are significant, 
with the elasticity of the labor being larger than the elasticity of the physical capital. That could suggest 
that most of the countries in the sample have more share of the labor factor than capital. That is, it is 
probable that the developing countries involve more labor-intensive processes while developed countries 
are more capital-intensive. For the rest of the essential variables in the present study, although they lose 
significance, the main results of the coefficient signs are not modified.

The variable ∆O appears to be not significant for the output but keep its positive sign. Moreover, 
the principal finding of this test is observed by the elasticity of the interaction between Openness (O and 
∆O) and Domestic Stock of Knowledge (∆lnSd), which confirms its negative relation, such as one of our 
main results of the original model indicates, even when we observe the countries by category.

Conclusions 
 
This article provides an empirical study on the influence that trade openness has on the growth of 
TFP in the sense that it is a channel of transmission of knowledge spillovers that affect the countries’ 
technological capacity. The focus of this paper was to extend this discussion to a sample that also includes 
developing countries. Therefore, it aimed not only to study openness as a channel of spillovers but also 
to  investigate  how  it  influences  the  domestic  generation  of  knowledge  and  the  productivity  of  the 
economies by categories of countries. 
 
The results reveal that the degree of openness does not have a permanent effect on TFP growth, 
although its variation rate shows a significant  and positive  impact on TFP, which implies that, in the 
short-run, a higher openness degree leads gains of TFP growth. This result is supported by all estimates. 
Another  variable  that  presents  a  very  important  influence  on  TFP  growth  is  the  Foreign  Stock  of 
Knowledge that countries receive from others with higher levels of technological development. For the 
countries that are more distant from the technological frontier, it is important, in the short term, to contact 
those countries that have technologically developed intermediate and finals goods because this implies 
savings  in  terms  of  time  and  resources  when  it  is  necessary  to  carry  out  any  productive  or  industrial 
process.  However,  it  does  not  necessarily  imply  that  these  technologies  are  developed  internally  by 
developing economies. It is necessary to associate imports of capital and intermediate goods to active 
learning strategies such as domestic technological efforts. 

 

The main idea investigated in this study was the interaction between openness (in level and in 
first difference) and the Domestic Stock of Knowledge, finding a significant negative link for the entire 
sample in most of the estimates. This suggests that more openness may impede productivity gains even 
domestic technological efforts are present. The reason could be associated with the predatory competition 
that does not allow the development of infant industries. Therefore, in order to present new evidence on 
this  issue,  both  with  theoretical  and  policy  implications,  we  proposed  to  also  test  this  hypothesis  by 
categories of countries. We found that the level of openness, when interacted with domestic R&D efforts, 
has a positive but not significant impact on TFP in high and middle-income countries.  For the rest of 
countries, the relationship is negative, being significant for emerging-income, both related to temporary 
and permanent  effects. Hence,  according to these results, these countries’ performance is in line with 
Rodriguez and Rodrick’s (2000) hypothesis, which is that countries with a large share of commodities in 
their  GDP  tend  to  specialize  in  this  type  of  market  to  the  detriment  of  their  domestic  technology 
industries.  
 
Nevertheless, another interesting finding of our research is that the interaction between openness 
and domestic knowledge is positive and significant only for the low-income countries in the first two 
decades of the sample, from 1969 to 1991. We can note in the figures of descriptive statistics that after 
the 1990s trade relations among countries intensified through financial integration and trade agreements. 
The results suggest that the liberalization of trade after these two decades has been little beneficial for 
developing  countries because, in the estimate for the second half  of the period, 1991-2014, the  scene 

 

15 

 
changes drastically, the coefficients turn negative and insignificant. In general, we conclude that in, in 
the  short  run,  openness  is  effectively  a  carrier  of  technological  spillover  that  improves  productivity 
growth  but  does  not  have  a  permanent  effect  in  the  long  run,  which  corroborates  the  results  of  the 
literature. Nevertheless, when we test how the economies react internally in industrial and technological 
terms, openness has negative effects on productivity in developing countries, as exposed above. Finally, 
we performed the sensitivity analyses, finding slight or no changes in the main results for the research 
purposes. It is important to make a final comment. Although these results have been tested by different 
robustness  tests,  for  future  work  is  recommended  contrasting  such  results  using  other  measures  of 
openness and stock of knowledge.

Appendix  

Tests and Diagnostics 

In this section, we proceed to do some tests on the prior estimations in order to identify several 
econometrics issues related to panel data methodology, following the guide proposed by Torres (2007). 
First, we prove if Fixed Effects (FE) is the appropriate model for this panel data through the Breusch-
Pagan Lagrange multiplier (LM), which helps in the choice between a FE regression or a simple Ordinary 
Least Square (OLS) regression. The null hypothesis in the LM test is that variances across entities are 
zero. This is, there is no significant difference across units and, therefore, no panel effect. In our case, 
table A1 shows the results for the LM test. For the p-value at a significance level of 95%, we reject the 
null  hypothesis  and  conclude  that  FE  is  appropriate.  I.e.,  there  is  evidence  of  significant  differences 
across countries, so a simple OLS regression cannot be run.

The  following  test  proves  the  presence  of  heteroskedasticity  in  the  estimated  model.  The  null 
hypothesis  is  homoskedasticity  or  constant  variance.  It  is  expected  that  this  hypothesis  will  not  be 
confirmed, because there are likely to be differences in variance between countries. Table A2 shows the 
results for this test. The p-value is < 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis of constant variance and, 
therefore, the model has the presence of heteroskedasticity.

One possible solution for this issue is to use the robust option into the FE and RE models to obtain 
heteroskedasticity-robust  standard  errors,  also  known  as  Huber-White  estimators.  For  this  reason, 
Section 4 only presented estimates for the models in their robust version. 
 
Table  A3  shows  the  results  from  the  first-stage  instrumental  variable  regressions.  Most  of  the 
instruments used for trade in level are significant and the r2 is of high value, which suggests that such 
instruments are valid and suitable to include into the model. The r2 are lower in the regressions side in 
which ΔO are dependent variables, and most of the estimated coefficients are insignificant. These results 
suggest  that  the  instruments  used  for  ΔO  are  not  of  high  quality  and  that  they  may  potentially  give 
misleading coefficient estimates of ΔO. We conclude that the openness lagged 1 year and the agricultural 
GDP (gross domestic product) are valid instruments, supported also by the Sargan-Hansen tests.

In order to test de cointegration revised in section, we proceed to apply the Wooldridge (2003) 
test  for  autocorrelation  and  the  Kao  (1999)  and  Westerlund  (2005)  tests  of  cointegration  on  a  panel 
dataset.  In the case of the Wooldridge test, there is the null hypothesis of no first-order autocorrelation. 
For the case of Kao and Westerlund tests, there is the common null hypothesis of no cointegration. The 
alternative hypothesis of the Kao test is that variables are cointegrated in all panels, while the Westerlund 
test supposes that the variables are cointegrated in some of the panels. This implies more constraint in 
the Kao test because it assumes a stronger hypothesis in relation to the other test.   
 
When  the  first  difference  of  a  nonstationary  process  is  stationary,  the  process  is  said  to  be 
integrated of order one, denoted I (1). When a linear combination of several I (1) series is stationary, the 
series  are  said  to  be  cointegrated  (ENGLE  &  GRANGER,  1987).  We  test  for  cointegration  because 
cointegration implies that the I (1) series are in a long-run equilibrium; they move together, although the 
group of them can wander arbitrarily.  In our case, we are interested in observing the long-run relationship 
between the growth rate of productivity and the openness in level, which is a nonstationary series, since 
it contains a unit root as proved by the Levin-Lin-Chu test and the Breitung test in section 3.4. From the 
p-value results of Tables A5 and A6, we cannot reject the null of the Autocorrelation test (for α=5%), 
and we reject the null of the Cointegration test. Hence, we conclude that the series is cointegrated and 
the inclusion of the variable openness in level is valid.
