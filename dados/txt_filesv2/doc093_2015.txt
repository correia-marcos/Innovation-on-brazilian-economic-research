Abstract: The article addresses the non-linear and heterogeneous relationship between public debt and economic
growth considering the recent combination of increasing public expenditures and debt with continuing low economic
growth observed in many countries, controlling the results by an institutional quality multidimensional indicator.
Economic theory generally supports a negative relationship between debt and growth in the long-run, whereas in the
short-run ﬁscal stimulus may induce positive eﬀects. Empirical literature provides some evidence for both, showing
that the negative relationship might become more important after reaching a certain threshold, but the results are
not absolutely conclusive. Problems of unobserved heterogeneity might be a major reason for that. To tackle the
problem of unobserved heterogeneity we suggest a two-stage procedure applied to a large sample of 154 countries.
We ﬁrst use cluster analysis to group the countries by their governance quality using the Worldwide Governance
Indicators (WGI) database. In a second step the relationship between public debt and growth is investigated using
simple and threshold multiple panel regression models (TMR). The results conﬁrm the coeﬃcients to be negative
in the long-run and to vary across country groups (clusters) depending on institutional quality.

Economic growth and public debt: addressing unobserved

heterogeneity

1

Introduction

Debt ranks high on the public agenda, not only in certain European countries where the ﬁnancial
crisis turned into a crisis of public debt. Governments all over the world have tried to stimulate
economic activity by means of tax relieves, subsidies and cheap money, creating and aggravating
ﬁscal imbalances. In many cases, growth remained low or declined even further. It is therefore
more than ever important to understand the impact of ﬁscal policy, public expenditure and debt
on economic growth and social welfare. Economic literature still provides insuﬃcient advice for
economic policy. Against this background, we review the existing literature on the relationship
between public debt2/public spending3 and economic growth.

Economic theory generally supports a negative relationship between debt and growth in the
long run through the traditional crowding out eﬀects, whereas in the short run ﬁscal policy may
temporarily induce growth through demand side stimulus, especially if households assume non-
Ricardian behavior and economic output is far from production capacity. Empirical evidence is
less clear. The ﬁndings vary considerably and are sensitive to the deﬁnition of the sample and
temporal coverage. Problems of endogeneity, nonlinearities and causality have been continuously
discussed. Proving causality is a very ambitious goal - probably the most ambitious one - and
general knowledge on growth econometrics provides little advice. Nonlinear and threshold mod-
els indeed have been an intensive area of research in recent years and considerably improved
knowledge and consistency of results. However, latest contributions have pointed to considerable
biases through hidden factors and unobserved heterogeneity (e.g. Panizza and Presbitero (2013),
Kourtellos et al. (2013)).

In order to estimate appropriately the nonlinear relationship and threshold given the hetero-
geneous sample of countries, we propose a two-stage approach to address this short-coming. We
account for unobserved heterogeneity by grouping the countries based on the quality of gover-
nance and institutions, making it observable. We use a cluster methodology based on the six
dimensions of the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) database to classify the large sample
of 154 countries into 5 more homogeneous groups. In a second step we apply the commonly used
linear and nonlinear models to investigate the relationship between public debt and growth to
each of the country groups.

The article is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the existing theoretical and empirical
literature including indications for unobserved heterogeneity. Section 3 discusses the possibilities
to address heterogeneity and motivates the utilization of institutional quality indicators. Section
4 presents our approach to control heterogeneity by means of cluster analysis and presents the
resulting country groups. Section 5 then evaluates several estimation techniques and analyses

2In this paper, government debt or public debt refer to gross general government debt, i.e. public liabilities
at all levels of government - central, provincial and local. We do not address the discussion about the impact of
federalism. The eﬀects of the allocation of ﬁscal power, transfer payments and the various redistribution channels
are not easy to measure, and the discussion on revenue sharing between central and local governments would go
well beyond the scope of this analysis. Gross general government debt covers external as well as domestic debt.
Even though there are valid arguments to distinguish external and domestic debt (domestic debt, issued under
domestic legal jurisdiction, is more easy to get rid of by inﬂation or changing credit or tax regulation), we do not
address them separately. The discussion seems less important today, than it has been before. Many emerging
markets rely much more on domestic creditors today as in the 1980s and 1990s. Rational markets should take into
account foreign and domestic debt alike.

3We basically focus on public debt. However, as public debt and public spending go hand in hand, it is beneﬁcial

to have a look at ﬁndings from research on public spending and other related areas as well.

the existence of a negative relationship between debt and growth and disclose the existence of
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in debt coeﬃcients between the sub-samples. Section 6 comments and
concludes.

2 Literature review

According to the conventional economic view, debt reﬂecting deﬁcit ﬁnancing due to government
spending or tax reduction, might stimulate aggregate demand and output in the short run.
In the long-run, an increase of public debt will indeed reduce the growth rate through lower
productivity4. No matter whether the debt inﬂuences the economic activity through crowding-
out eﬀects, higher interest rates, higher volatility due to reduced ﬂexibility of the government
to perform an anti-cyclical ﬁscal policy and/or uncertainties about future policies and taxation,
at the end debt reduces investment, hamper the increase of the capital stock and thus ﬁnally
slow down growth in productivity and economic growth. Lower productivity in turn means lower
competitiveness and will therefore negatively impact the trade balance. And ﬁnally with growth
being reduced, tax revenue is likely to decrease, increasing the probability of further budget
deﬁcits and recourse on credits, initiating a vicious cycle.

The eﬀects of debt and ﬁscal policy on growth depend on the structure as well as on the level
of taxation and expenditure. The literature distinguishes various types of taxes and expenditures
- e.g. more and less distortionary taxes, public consumption versus investment, unproductive
versus productive spending or diﬀerent public expenditure categories, i.e. military, social secu-
rity, education or health expenditures (e.g. Devarajan et al. (1996) or Kneller et al. (1999)).
Productive expenditures are generally found to have more positive impact unless ﬁnanced by
distortionary taxes.

The extent of the eﬀect of ﬁscal policy may be reduced by partial or complete Ricardian
behaviour (Barro, 1974). That is, if individual actors anticipate the future impact of public
expenditure and increasing debt and adapt their behaviour to neutralize the eﬀect. Even in
presence of such a situation of anticipatory market participants where the theory of debt neutrality
or Ricardian equivalence would be perfectly met, the impact of additional debt will, however,
most probably not be zero. Government consumption and future taxation may involve changes
in relative utilities and have distortionary eﬀects as a whole.

Empirical ﬁndings on the relationship between public debt and growth are not clear and
sometimes even inconsistent. Many studies provide evidence for a negative relationship between
public expenditure, government consumption, budget deﬁcits or public debt and growth (e.g.
Aiginger and Falk (2005) or Kumar and Woo (2010)). Nonetheless, evidence has been generally
inconclusive, sensitive to the selection of the sample and time-period investigated and smaller than
expected. Also endogeneity and causality issues have been disputed. In principle, this is little
surprising. The literature on the relationship between public debt and growth builds on the vast
research on the determinants of medium and long-run growth. Therefore, the same challenges and
concerns about robustness, speciﬁcation of the explanatory variables and intermediating factors
apply (see Sala-i Martin (1997), Sala-i Martin et al. (2004) or also the comprehensive summary
on growth econometrics by Durlauf et al. (2005)).

Attempts to unravel the puzzling relationship between debt and growth have intensiﬁed re-
cently. Especially gained momentum the idea of a nonlinear relationship and the existence of
a ”debt threshold”. Of special importance has been the analysis of Reinhart and Rogoﬀ (2012)
who - based on a comprehensive panel consisting of 44 countries and a two-centuries time span -

4Elmendorf and Mankiw (1999) give a comprehensive overview of the theoretical literature on the macroeconomic

eﬀects of government debt.

ﬁnd evidence for a signiﬁcant negative relationship between debt and growth for countries with
”high” debt levels (higher than 90 percent of GDP), whereas the link between debt and growth
seemed to be weak at ”normal” debt levels. Reinhart and Rogoﬀ (2012) have been criticized and
challenged by Herndon et al. (2013) who show that the threshold eﬀect vanishes after correcting
for a coding error and using a diﬀerent weighting of the data. Nevertheless the work has inspired
a vast and growing empirical literature devoted to conﬁrm the existence of causal relationships
as well as nonlinearity and thresholds eﬀects. Several contributions conﬁrmed the existence of
nonlinearity, whilst others did not ﬁnd such evidence.

Besides this recent revitalized empirical research, Tanzi and Zee (1996) and Devarajan et al.
(1996) already suggested a couple of years ago that the relationship between growth and ﬁscal
variables may not be monotonic and that not only the type of use and sourcing (distortionary
vs. undistortionary) is important, but also the level of the expenditure. Devarajan et al. (1996)
showed that even productive expenditures could become unproductive if there is an excessive
amount of them.

Searching for nonlinearity Checherita and Rother (2010) used a sample of 12 euro area coun-
tries and data between 1970-2008. They found evidence for an inversely u-shaped relationship
between government debt and growth with a turning point between 90%-100%. Baum et al.
(2013) also analysed 12 Euro area countries, but limited to a more narrow period between 1990-
2010, and conﬁrmed these results. For high debt ratios above 95%, additional debt has a clearly
negative impact on economic activity. Cecchetti et al. (2011), for a sample of 18 OECD coun-
tries and a period of 1980-2009, ﬁnd a negative impact of public debt on the subsequent average
growth. A 10 percentage points increase in the debt ratio is associated with a 17-18 basis points
reduction in growth. Taking into account threshold eﬀects, they state indeed, that government
debt only starts to reduce economic growth once it crosses a threshold of about 85 percent. Be-
low this level the relationship is insigniﬁcant. On the other hand, Pescatori et al. (2014) do not
ﬁnd any particular debt threshold. Notwithstanding, they ﬁnd evidence that the debt trajectory
might have an important impact on future growth. A country’s debt trajectory can even be as
important as the level of debt. Countries with high but declining debt, can experience the same
growth rate as a low indebted country. However, Pescatori et al. (2014) also ﬁnd evidence that
higher levels of debt are associated with a higher degree of output volatility.

The majority of the empirical research focuses on advanced economies for data availability
reasons (OECD data) or for other considerations. But evidence exist that growth eﬀects diﬀer
between country groups. For a more comprehensive sample of 155 countries, Afonso and Jalles
(2013) ﬁnd a much lower debt ratio threshold of 59%. The endogenous thresholds is slightly
higher at 79% of GDP for emerging countries whereas for the Euro area it is 58%. Kumar and
Woo (2010) use a series of panel data estimators for a sample of 38 emerging and developing
economies over the period of 1970-2009. They ﬁnd a negative relationship between debt and
growth - on average a 10 percentage points increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with
a slowdown in annual real per capita GDP growth of 0.2 percentage points per year - as well as
evidence for nonlinearities with high debt levels having a proportionately larger negative eﬀect.
In addition they detect the impact of debt to be smaller in advanced economies. Advanced
economies experience a lower slowdown of around 0.15%–0.2%, whereas the eﬀect in emerging
economies is twice as large (0.3%–0.4%).

Emerging market countries experience diﬃculties in raising additional funds at higher debt
levels that would be manageable by advanced country criteria without any problem. At the same
time they experience high incentives to increase spending - meeting need to invest in education,
social security, and public goods, what favours a policy of expanding public expenditures. Rein-
hart et al. (2003) state that in the case of emerging markets the risk of a credit event starts to
increase signiﬁcantly at levels of external debt above 30-35% of GNP already. Cases of external
debt default have occurred at a ratio of debt to GNP as low as 47% in the case of Mexico in

4

1982, at a ratio of slightly above 50% in the case of Argentina in 2001 or 20% in Ecuador in 2008
(Reinhart and Rogoﬀ (2009)). All this evidence suggests that cross-country heterogeneity can
dramatically aﬀect the empirical analysis.

The language utilized in the debt-and-growth literature implicitly suggests a link going from
debt to growth - our contribution is no exception - most probably because such a link seems
desirable from an economic policy perspective. But causality remains undetermined. Panizza
and Presbitero (2012) using a sample of 17 advanced economies conclude that a causal link going
from public debt to economic growth may not exist. And Lof and Malinen (2014), using a panel
vector auto-regression (PVAR) model for a panel of 20 developed countries, ﬁnd no statistically
signiﬁcant eﬀect of debt on growth for any level of debt, while GDP growth is found to have
a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect on debt. While causality will remain diﬃcult to establish, the
robustness of results can be improved by controlling for unobserved heterogeneity.

Data limitations, varying samples of countries across studies, diﬀering time periods or prob-
lems with endogeneity or multicollinearity can result in lack of robustness and consequently
inconsistent results. Researchers address these problems by delimiting to a core set of growth
determinants on the basis of general growth econometrics. Many contributions also work with in-
strumental variables and use TSLS or GMM models. Some did robustness test as well, estimating
their models for various sub-samples - using segmentations on income or development levels, ge-
ographical aﬃliation, membership in international organizations etc. GMM models however are
only partially suitable for macroeconomic cross-country datasets as the number of observations
is generally relatively small. Kumar and Woo (2010) show that the results obtained with GMM
estimations are similar to the results with standard OLS, with OLS coeﬃcients being somewhat
smaller than the GMM ones. Reinhart et al. (2012) and Panizza and Presbitero (2013) provide
good summaries of the empirical literature and the diﬀerent approaches used.

Even though recent analysis has produced more robust evidence, there has been an increase in
the literature and improvements in econometric methods that allowed for a better understanding
of the nature of the relationship, the possibility to derive concrete policy measures and their
acceptance is still limited. The empirical evidence has been weaker than generally assumed.

Some recent contributions have claimed attention for misleading estimates of nonlinearity and
thresholds by using pooled and panel data without controlling appropriately the heterogeneity
between countries. Panizza and Presbitero (2013) demonstrate that aggregate data produces
an inverted U-shaped relationship between growth and public debt even though the country-
speciﬁc regressions generally indicates a U-shaped or even positive relationship between debt and
growth. They state: “the relationship is characterized by very large cross country heterogeneity
[...]” and “[...] may depend on institutional quality, on the dimension of the public sector, on
how and why debt has been accumulated, and on the structure and composition of public debt”.
Kourtellos et al. (2013) - who also emphasize that not accounting for parameter heterogeneity
may be an important limitation of many existing work and lead to spurious results - address
parameter heterogeneity by including democracy as a control variable for institutional quality.
They speciﬁcally ﬁnd that the relationship between debt and growth depends on the extent of
democracy.

Overall however, the problem of parameter heterogeneity has received little attention so far
and variables on the institutional environment have widely been ignored, even though several
papers have provided evidence that countries with diﬀerent institutional structures - e.g. economic
and systemic arrangements - likely have diﬀerent debt levels and start facing negative eﬀects
from additional debt at diﬀerent levels. Controlling for institutional quality variables or for
macroeconomic structures is therefore an important area for further research.

3 Controlling heterogeneity using institutional quality indicators

Heterogeneity is in the center of any cross-country study. Observed and not observed diﬀerences
are combined to explain diﬀerences in other depending variables. As the independent variables
rarely capture the entire cross-country diﬀerences, additional control for unobserved heterogeneity
is necessary. In case of unobserved heterogeneity, the use of pooled techniques can be misleading
and some authors therefore suggest to not utilize it (Panizza and Presbitero, 2013). On the other
hand, switching to an individual country-speciﬁc analysis is usually not feasible, due to insuﬃcient
observations in the individual country sample. For this reason, the use panel data became the
most common method to investigate empirically the correlation between public debt and growth
at macroeconomic level. Fixed or random eﬀects models have been commonly used to isolate the
eﬀect of heterogeneity in order to compute the debt coeﬃcient in a consistent and eﬃcient way.
These traditional ﬁxed or random eﬀects help to isolate the cross-country heterogeneity and to
estimate more signiﬁcant and eﬃcient debt regressors. But they do not help to explain the origins
of the heterogeneity. Although the heterogeneity is isolated in diﬀerent country’s intercepts with
ﬁxed or random eﬀects, the problem of parameter heterogeneity remains.

Another predominant practice has been to group countries according to some pre-deﬁned cri-
teria, generally default deﬁnitions like OECD, Asian or Euro area countries for example, without
motivating the selection. A common characteristic to classify countries - apart from geograph-
ical ones - is income per capita. Well known examples include the Worldbank classiﬁcation
distinguishing low, medium and high-income countries. The existing empirical literature on the
relationship between debt and growth provides evidence for diﬀerent debt-growth relationships
in emerging market economies as opposed to advanced economies. Income-based classiﬁcations
can possibly be useful, of course, depending on the purpose at stake, but cannot explain or dis-
entangle the existence of heterogeneity. At best, these criteria allow to compute more signiﬁcant
and eﬃcient regressors, without explaining the origins of heterogeneity and its eﬀects over the
debt-growth relationship. The heterogeneity itself and its consequences on the relationship be-
tween debt and growth continue unknown. An explicit control for heterogeneity variables, e.g.
using methods for grouping such as cluster analysis, can overcome this problem and therefore
improve the results. The advantage will be illustrated in the next sections.

We further argue that income-based classiﬁcation criteria alone do not capture well the driving
factors behind a country’s ﬁscal policy. A country’s institutional setting may be a key factor
explaining the design and reliability of its ﬁscal policy. Kourtellos et al. (2013) provide evidence
in this direction. They ﬁnd higher public debt to have a negative eﬀect on growth in low-
democracy regimes, whereas in high-democracy regimes no statistically signiﬁcant relationship
can be found.

There are several reasons why institutional quality and macroeconomic stability may shape
the relationship between debt and growth. Markets can be more sensitive to debt increases and
changes in ﬁscal and economic policy in the cases of countries with weak institutions and/or
with unstable macroeconomic environment. A variety of channels may connect the institutional
and macroeconomic environment to the relationship between debt and growth. In case of weak
institutional quality:

• Uncertainty may generally be higher.
• Interest rates may react more strongly as lenders request a higher risk premium.
• Crowding-out eﬀects may be more pronounced.
• Pressure to pursue an expansionary monetary policy may be more accentuated due to lower
central bank autonomy, leading to an increase in inﬂation. Reinhart and Rogoﬀ (2012) show

6

that high public debt levels empirically coincide with higher inﬂation in emerging market
countries, whereas in advanced economies it generally does not.

• Political and economic power may be less balanced - favoring some sectors at the detriment

of others - leading to public and social costs through ineﬃcient allocation.

• Tax revenue needed to cover debt and interest rate payments may have a more distortionary
and consequently more negative impact as taxation is supposed to be more diﬃcult in case
of countries with weak institutions. Tax evasion is supposed to be high, the tax base
generally small and the collection of revenues more costly and control-intensive, leading
governments to develop tax systems that are ineﬃcient from an economic perspective and
exploit whatever they can (Tanzi and Zee (2000)).

• Corruption may be more prevalent and part of the money will dissipate.

Making a long story short, the quality of the prevailing institutions may inﬂuence the “return

on investment” of (additional) public expenditure and public debt.

The Worldwide Governance Indicators

To capture the eﬀect of governance and institutional quality, we refer to the Worldwide
Governance Indicators, WGI. We brieﬂy resume the main characteristics of the indicators below
which are well suited to control heterogeneity and help to estimate threshold models appropriately.
For a complete methodology of the WGI dataset see Kaufmann et al. (2010) and Kaufmann et al.
(1999b).

The WGI summarize the multiple views on the quality of governance. It has been developed
with the support of the World Bank in 1999. The database covers more than 200 countries and
compiles several hundred individual variables on governance taken from 32 data sources. The
WGI are based exclusively on subjective or perceptive measures of governance, an approach that
is justiﬁed ﬁrst by the fact that this kind of information (perceptions, impressions, views) is what
drives agents’ actions, second because there are no objective measures available in many areas
of governance, and third because the distinction between “subjective” and “objective” measures
is often less clear-cut than it might seem. The data are gathered from a number of survey
institutes, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and private
sector ﬁrms.

Six aggregate indicators are derived using a statistical tool known as unobserved components
model (UCM)5 and available for a period of 1996-2013.6 The full WGI dataset is available at
www.govindicators.org.

The six indicators refer to three aspects of governance (Kaufmann et al., 2010):

1. The process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced;

• Voice and Accountability - capturing the extent to which a country’s citizens are able to
participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, association
and media;

• Political Stability and Absence of Violence - capturing the likelihood that the govern-
ment will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including
politically motivated violence and terrorism;

2. The capacity of the government to eﬀectively formulate and implement sound policies;

5See Kaufmann et al. (1999a) for a detailed discussion of the aggregation methodology used.
6Between 1996 and 2002 the indicators are available every second year only. As from 2002, they are updated

on a yearly basis.

7

• Government Eﬀectiveness - capturing the quality of public services, the quality of
the civil service and its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy
formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government’s commitment
to such policies;

• Regulatory Quality - capturing the ability of the government to formulate and imple-
ment sound policies and regulations that permit and promote private sector develop-
ment;

3. The respect of citizens and the state for the institutions.

• Rule of Law - capturing the extent to which agents have conﬁdence in and abide by
the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property
rights, the police and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence;

• Control of Corruption - capturing the extent to which public power is exercised for
private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as “capture”
of the state by elites and private interests.

As any synthesizing indicator, also the WGI database has its strengths and weaknesses. Main
critics involve scaling (the data always relies on observed characteristics, i.e. the world average
is the same in each year) or the source and quality of the underlying perception data which
may show correlated errors, be biased towards perceptions of the elite or inﬂuenced by the
recent performance of the country. Kaufmann et al. (2007) respond to these critics, which we
acknowledge but consider to be of minor importance and generally inevitable.

The alternative would be to rely on objective or de jure measures. The democracy variable
from the “Polity IV Project“ database used by Kourtellos et al. (2013) as a proxy for institutional
quality is based on de jure criteria. The major disadvantages of de jure measures are that they
contain limited information about peoples’ real incentives and show little variance especially for
advanced economies in the recent past. We consider these drawbacks to be more substantial.

Finally, the WGI data are convenient to use in cluster analysis as all of them are quantitative

variables and are already standardized.

4 Cluster Analysis

We classify the countries according to their institutional quality measured by the WGI indicators
and utilize cluster technique to group them into more homogeneous clusters. Thereafter the
resulting sub-samples can be used in panel regressions. The two-stage procedure allows to explore
at the same time the pooled data (increasing the degree of freedom of the model), estimate ﬁxed
or random eﬀects and control for institutional variables that account for heterogeneity.

Cluster analysis is a major technique to group heterogeneous individuals by ﬁnding relatively
homogeneous groups based on multivariate characteristics. The cluster methodology is frequently
used in medical research, in biology, in marketing and many other social sciences, but still less
common in economics.

Some recent research has applied clustering techniques to cross-country data to isolate het-
erogeneity. Zielenkiewicz (2014) and Unlukaplan (2011) both apply cluster methods to WGI data
to analyse the socio-economic development process. But both papers restrict to EU countries.
V´azquez and Sumner (2012) and Aubyn (2007) use cluster techniques to identify cross-country
groups on a global scale, Aubyn (2007) uses data from the World Economic Forum, V´azquez and
Sumner (2012) create their own database based on various sources.

Cluster analysis groups individuals in order to maximize within-group similarity while at
the same time maximizing dissimilarity between groups, based on a set of distinct variables

8

Xp = {X1, ..., XP} characterizing each individual i = {1, ...j, ..., n}. In principle, cluster analysis
does not start from a theoretical argument and does not even make an explanation of why a cluster
exists. Cluster are based on a distance measuring in RP space. Nevertheless it is important to
have a conceptual basis to explain why groups might exist.

There are three important decisions in any cluster analysis: the determination of (1) the
clustering variables, (2) the dissimilarity or distance measure, and (3) where to stop the agglom-
erating of the individuals or decide how many group must exist. In contrast to other multivariate
techniques, the clustering variables are speciﬁed by the researcher. The focus of a cluster analysis
lies on the comparison of the individual distances, not on the variables.

We argue that the governance indicators are appropriate variables to account for institu-
tional weakness and the quality of the prevailing institutions in turn inﬂuences the “return on
investment” of public expenditure and public debt, as explained in the previous section. Clusters
based on the quality of governance may be an important diﬀerential, therefore, in the relationship
between debt and economic growth.

Similarity or dissimilarity between the diﬀerent countries is determined on the basis of the
selected variables and only refer to the P variables entering the cluster analysis, i.e. the WGI in
our case. The hypothesis that the resulting groups show similar or dissimilar behaviour regard-
ing variables not entering the grouping (e.g. government debt or GDP growth) remains purely
speculative and has to be detected separately. This is convenient for our purpose, as the cluster
analysis does neither anticipate the result nor interfere with the following analysis of the relation-
ship between debt and growth. We use all six dimensions covered by WGI as cluster variables
and thereby assume that countries are similar if they show similar institutional quality. Using
only the WGI indicator to cluster the countries is an advantageous strategy, as we can isolate the
variables used to observe heterogeneity from that macroeconomic variables used in the economic
model.

Several clustering algorithms or methods and measures of dissimilarity exist. Since the number
of countries is ﬁxed and we do not know the number of clusters that will emerge, we use the Ward
(1963) hierarchical method which directly bases upon the squared Euclidean distance measure.
The Ward method takes the minimization of the variance of the sum of all squared Euclidean
distances before and after fusion in a certain step k as criterion for fusion.

The Euclidean distance and squared Euclidean distance are amongst the most frequently used
distance measures in cluster analysis. It is deﬁned as the distance between two observations (i
and j) which corresponds to the sum of the squares of the diﬀerences between observations i and
j for all variables Xp. The squared Euclidean distance is given by equation (1):

dij =

(Xip − Xjp)(cid:48)(Xip − Xjp) where

i = {1, ..., j, ..., n}

(1)

p=1

where i, j identify the individual (country), p = {1, ..., P} is the number of characteristic variable
used, dij is a matrix with nxn dimension and n is the number of cross-section units or countries
in our case.

A Ward’s Euclidean distance matrix (nxP ) in equation (2) is computed in each step k in
order to determine the minimum variance. It is slightly diﬀerent from the Euclidean i, j distance
in equation (1) as it is computed against the average of the existing groups ¯Xp.

The Ward method is a hierarchical agglomerative method. Starting from the bottom, where
each individual (country) is a cluster by itself, a recursive procedure runs up and continuously
groups individual by individual into an existing cluster. At the top, after the last step, only one
big cluster remains, including all the countries.

The procedure is executed k = 1, ..., n − 1 times.

In each step k a new bigger cluster Cij will emerge merging the closest clusters Ci and Cj, as the

Our clustering variables are ﬁrst the three-year averages between 2010 and 2012 for all the
six dimensions covered by WGI, i.e. voice and accountability, political instability and absence of
violence, government eﬀectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption. The
three year averages avoid giving too much emphasis on one single year. Second, we also include
the variation in each of the six WGI dimensions over the whole period 1996-2012. Therefore, the
Ward matrix has a dimension nx12.

There is no single objective procedure to determine the correct number of clusters. For hier-
archical methods, the change in total heterogeneity as the number of clusters decreases provides
an indication. We base our decision on a graphical analysis (cf. dendrograms in ﬁgure (1)) and
on a sample of commonly used dissimilarity criteria (table (1)).

We decide to work with ﬁve country clusters. The Calinski-Harabasz test does not provide
a decision criterion in our case, as it does not show a maximum7.
In case of the Duda-Hard
stopping rule, the strategy is to identify one of the largest Je(2)/Je(1) values that corresponds
to a low pseudo-T-squared value. Larger values for Je(2)/Je(1) statistics indicate more distinct
clustering, whereas at the same time smaller pseudo-T-squared values indicate more distinct
clustering. Based on the Duda-Hard index alone, we would probably select to work with 8
groups then. However, as the values for 5 clusters are fairly good and Calinski-Harabasz as well
as practical reasons suggest to work with a smaller number of clusters, we decide in favour of 5
groups. These groups are used subsequently to split up the data on debt and growth into diﬀerent
sub-samples.

The analysis of the variance of the clustering variables between the detected clusters demon-
strates that the model is well-shaped as is displayed in table (2). All clusters are signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent across the WGI variables. Furthermore, the variance with regard to GDP growth and
government debt also provides ﬁrst evidence for our hypothesis on the impact of institutional
quality on GDP growth and government debt. The diﬀerent country clusters show signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent growth and government debt levels.

Figure 2: Cluster characteristics

Cluster analysis has some major deﬁciencies of course. Adding a new individual, or a new
country in our case, can signiﬁcantly change the resulting groups and a country that belonged
to one group may change to another. Cluster analysis is therefore unsuitable for application in
sample studies, where the number of cross-section units varies. This restriction does not aﬀect
our case, as we are working with a complete and predetermined set of countries. Another critical
point is that the grouping variables are determined discretionarily by the researcher and not
due to a corresponding previous analysis. In addition, Nielsen (2011) criticizes the large degree
of freedom in choosing among alternative distance measures and cluster algorithms, and the
diﬃculty to periodically update the taxonomy.9

5 Models on the relationship between debt and growth

Given heterogeneity across countries, we investigate how the detected diﬀerences in institutional
characteristics help to explain the relationship between debt and growth. We use simple and
threshold multiple regression models (TMR), adapting the threshold autoregressive models de-
veloped by Tong (1978, 1983). We start with some descriptive statistics of the data. To make

natural partition of the data.

8WGI indicators three-year averages 2010-2012, GDP growth and government debt in 2012.
9Nielsen (2011) develops an alternative approach to overcome this deﬁciencies, noting lack of clarity with regard
to the underlying rationale of the existing UNDP, World Bank, and IMF classiﬁcation. Nielsen’s approach is based
on Lorenz curves. In his classiﬁcation methodology a discretionary number of country groups are built in a way
that all groups show the same error between the actual and an even distribution within each group.

12

the procedure as transparent as possible, we then perform estimations for a linear model without
threshold comparing various estimation methodologies such as pooled OLS, between estima-
tor (BE)10, ﬁxed eﬀects (FE), two-stage-least-square (TSLS) and general method of moments
(GMM) in a panel framework. Regressions are ﬁrst computed without clustering the countries.
In sequence, we proceed with the analysis for the sub-samples previously determined by cluster
analysis using GMM estimator with period and country ﬁxed eﬀects to compute linear models,
and ﬁnally go on to nonlinear sample-split models with exogenous threshold. The analysis focuses
on the observed heterogeneity across clusters and controls remaining unobserved heterogeneity
of macroeconomic variables across countries by ﬁxed eﬀect estimator.

5.1 Data and descriptive statistics

We analyse data for 154 countries covering the period 1990-2012 and refrain from using a longer
time span in order to exclude structural changes and to get more meaningful results for today’s
economy. The key variable, gross government debt-to-GDP ratio, is compiled by the IMF for
a large cross-section of countries and a long time-period.11. The other variables - GDP growth
as well as control and instrumental variables - originate from the World Development Indicators
(WDI) database.12 Time-series on inﬂation as measured by consumer prices are taken from the
IMF World Economic Outlook database, as these series are more complete.

The boxplot in ﬁgure (3) shows the distribution of our key variables GDP growth and gov-
ernment debt for the ﬁve country clusters. Considerable diﬀerences exist depending on the level
of institutional quality. Better institutional quality (e.g. cluster 5 compared to cluster 1-4) seems
to go hand in hand with increasing debt but also with decreasing growth. However, the overlap
between the groups is relatively large. Within-group variation is considerable and displays a
non-continuous development with regard to the institutional quality dimension. Within-group
variation in GDP growth is typically larger than the variation of government debt except for
cluster 5 whose members show very little variation with regard to economic growth.

Figure 3: Distribution of GDP growth and government debt by country cluster

In the subsequent analysis of the relationship between debt and growth, we check for a set
of control variables, using adjusted R2, the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR), F statistic and

J-statistic as a criteria to select the control variables. As the panel is not balanced, we refrain
from including desirable variables in a few cases, e.g. in case of education or interest rates. The
inclusion of these variables would result in a massive loss of observations. The resulting list of
control variables is given below:

• Investment, % of GDP - measured as gross capital formation (formerly gross domestic
investment) consists of outlays on additions to the ﬁxed assets of the economy plus net
changes in the level of inventories;

• Trade openness, % of GDP - (imports+exports)/GDP;
• Inﬂation, annual % - consumer prices;
• GDP per capita, in current USD;
• Government consumption, % of GDP - to approximate the share of public sector production

in contrast to private sector production;

• Government consumption growth, annual %;
• Population growth, annual %.

Table (4) gives some descriptive statistics - mean values and standard deviation - for the

control variables for each of the sub-samples as well as the entire sample of 154 countries13.

In the next sections we estimate a variety of models using aggregated and clustered data
applying linear and nonlinear models to empirically analyse the dynamic between growth and
public debt.

5.2 Model without cluster and without threshold

The ﬁrst model is the more aggregated and general one. We compare several estimation methods,
pooled, between estimator (BE), ﬁxed eﬀect (FE) computed by OLS, TSLS estimation as well as

13Depending on the availability of data the total number of countries may vary between 154 and 176.

14

generalized moments (GMM), all of them applied to the entire data sample without clustering and
without threshold. Estimations of this kind are frequently reported in the literature. The results
given in table (5) can thus be contrasted to a multitude of existing results by various authors. An
auto-regression term of GDP growth in t − 1 is included to avoid potential correlation between
the endogenous variable and the error term, thereby converting the model into a dynamic panel.

Our base model takes the following form:

yit = α + λDit + βyit−1 + X(cid:48)

itγγγ + µt + νi + it

(4)

where Di,t is the variable for government debt, XitxK depicts the matrix of control variables
{1, ..., K} and µt and νi are the terms for period and country ﬁxed eﬀects.

In the case of TSLS and GMM, instrumental variables are added to the model, which assume

the following forms:

yit = α + λDit + βyit−1 + X(cid:48)

itγγγ + Z(cid:48)

(5)
where Zit is a matrix of dimension ZitxL corresponding to {1, ..., L} instrumental variables and
γγγ and δδδ are a Lx1 column vector of the coeﬃcients.

itδδδ + µt + νi + it

Multiple regression models of this kind are a typical starting point in the empirical literature
on public debt and growth. The list of control variables may diﬀer somewhat. Almost always
price level, interest rates and the business cycle need to be adjusted, however. Price level, because
the real value of the debt is, for most purposes, more important than the nominal value - in our
case, as debt data is already PPPGDP adjusted, this is not necessary; interest rate, to capture the
market value of the debt - we refrain from including it due to many missing values; and business
cycle, because the deﬁcit rises automatically when economic activity slows and vice versa. The
short-term business cycle ﬂuctuation is often captured using ﬁve-year-ahead overlapping averages
of GDP growth rates. As ﬁve-year averages also level out variances that are not attributable to
business cycles, we prefer to stick to the annual data and alternatively decide to include an auto-
regressive term for GDP growth. Additionally, where speciﬁed, period and country ﬁxed eﬀects
are controlled.

The model formalized in equation (4) is computed by pooled and OLS panel and equation
(5) by instrumental variables techniques. In the latter case two-stage-least-square (TSLS) and
generalized method of moment (GMM)14 estimators are used. Our results are consistent with the
existing empirical literature, despite the diﬀerences with regard to the sample, covering a large
number of countries and unbalanced data between 1990 to 2012, and the prevailing diﬀerences
in the selected control variables. All the estimators in table (5) compute a negative coeﬃcient
of GovDebt but vary based on consistence and eﬃciency reasons, resulting from omitted and
endogenous variables. The global government debt coeﬃcient is negative in the range of -0.008 to
-0.0518 depending on the estimation methodology used. Similar result were found by Kourtellos
et al. (2013), Cecchetti et al. (2011), Kumar and Woo (2010) and many others.

Economic growth and government debt are both highly aggregated macroeconomic variables
and therefore subject to many inﬂuences from a multitude of other variables, and even more
than this, in a complex temporal dynamic. For this reason, estimating a complete model with
exogenous variables is an almost impossible mission, and the best option is to use instrumen-
tal variables techniques. As the results given in table (5) conﬁrm, the coeﬃcient of GovDebt
signiﬁcantly improves in comparison to the traditional pooled, between and ﬁxed eﬀects models
in the case of instrumental variables techniques (TSLS and GMM). Signiﬁcant diﬀerence exists
between the TSLS and GMM estimators. The SSR statistics is not useful to select the best
estimator in this case. We decide in favour of GMM estimator because the signiﬁcance of all

14Since the model is a dynamic and linear one, the Arellano Bond two step estimator or White period system

covariances is applied.

coeﬃcients is higher comparing with TSLS. This result is important for the re-estimation of the
model considering clustered data. We will do this in the next sections using the GMM estimator.
As Kumar and Woo (2010) describe in detail, the pooled and BE estimations suﬀer from
many biases - both due to omitted-variables and measurement errors. They argue however
that other things equal, these measurement errors tend to reduce the correlation between the
regressors and the country ﬁxed eﬀects, and therefore reduce the heterogeneity bias. Controlling
for ﬁxed-eﬀects across countries and over the time (FE and FE+TE) addresses the problem of
the omitted-variables bias but exacerbates the measurement error problem. However, TSLS and
GMM would at least theoretically and as long as instruments are valid, i.e. uncorrelated with
the errors, address the omitted-variables bias, endogeneity, and measurement errors. Strong and
valid instruments are diﬃcult to encounter. Yet a further and major limiting factor of GMM
models is their infeasibility for the analysis of small samples.

For the analysis of macro data GMM models should be generally used with caution. The main
motive is the diﬃculty to ﬁnd appropriate instruments, mainly in the case of multiple regression
model, as in our case. The common practice in macroeconomics with regard to instrumental
variables is the use of lagged values of endogenous variables as instruments. We use two lagged
observations of each potential endogenous variables as instruments.

5.3 Linear model with cluster without threshold

We apply GMM estimation controlling for period and country ﬁxed eﬀects to the sub-samples
previously determined by cluster analysis. Table (6) lists the respective results for all of the ﬁve
country groups in comparison to the entire sample. The debt coeﬃcient is positive for cluster

16

1 (poor institutional quality countries) and negative in all other cases. Nonetheless, the size
and signiﬁcance of the impact of the debt coeﬃcient varies considerably, ranging from -0.045 for
cluster 2 to -0.159 for cluster 3, which indicates an impact that is about three times higher. Debt
coeﬃcients for clusters 1, 3 and 4, are considerably higher than for the overall estimation (column
6). These results conﬁrm the advantage of observed heterogeneity controlled by institutions, as
suggested in this paper. Controlling the unobserved heterogeneity by cross-country ﬁxed eﬀect
in panel data is not suﬃcient to capture the appropriate correlation between debt and growth.

It is interesting to note that the institutional quality heterogeneity does not display a mono-
tonically increasing or decreasing correlation regarding the relationship between growth and debt.
On the contrary. The results indicate that in addition to a possible within-group quadratic or
otherwise nonlinear relation between debt and growth (which we did not investigate so far), also
the inﬂuence of institutional quality on the relationship between debt and growth is highly com-
plex. Further research on the channel between institutional quality and the debt-and-growth
relationship is therefore certainly indicated.

An interesting linkage to explore might be the propensity of changes in institutional quality
or the reliability of the persistence of a country’s institutional setting in periods of crisis, which
might be higher for some groups than for others. Countries ﬁguring in medium (3) and good
(4) governance quality environments could be more diﬃcult to classify from a political credibility
point of view as countries in group (5). They might be more suspect to succumb to populist
policy measures, to experience a higher risk of institutional quality changes and therefore suﬀer a
more negative impact from additional debt. At the both extremes, poor and top, there are little
doubt about the permanence of institutional environment and this, in a certain way, remains
priced. In the middle, the institutional quality may be more prone to change. A possible starting
point to test this hypotheses could be a detailed investigation of the variation in the institutional
quality variables or the propensity of changes in credit market ratings. Risks of downgrading are
typically very low for countries with top institutional governance as their credibility is scarcely
called into question. On the other hand, the positive coeﬃcient in cluster 1 can be theoretically
justiﬁed by myopia or very strong preferences for present public expenditures given the uncertain
future of these countries.

if we consider that in the poor institutional countries, each public cents help to burst the
growth because the per capita income or productivity as a hole is equally so low that even a
bad allocation of public resources has greater returns than the low productivity observed abroad,
overcoming the negative eﬀects.

The coeﬃcients of the control variables generally have the expected sign and are in most cases
statistically signiﬁcant. It is interesting to note that a higher level of government consumption
is associated with lower growth in all institutional conditions. This means that a higher share of
public consumption is generally supposed to be negative e.g. because of lower eﬃciency and high
risk of persistence. Surprisingly however, also government consumption growth shows a negative
sign in most cases but for cluster 2 and for the insigniﬁcant coeﬃcient in cluster 3. This suggests
that successful short-term ﬁscal stimulus may be a very challenging policy in most situations.
Of special interest is the comparison of the goodness of ﬁt of the sub-sample model estimations
compared to the estimation for the entire sample. For all sub-samples but the medium one,
the models are clearly superior to the overall estimation. We can check this dividing the total
SSR by the number of observations. This substantiates the relevance of institutional quality as
a parameter for the debt and growth relationship and conﬁrms the suitability of the variables
to control for unobserved heterogeneity. Further analysis to investigate other existing sources of
unobserved heterogeneity and sources of the nonlinearity in institutional quality are still needed.

5.4 Nonlinear model with cluster and exogenous threshold

As a next step we investigate the existence of a nonlinear relationship within each of the sub-
samples. The common practice in debt and growth literature follows the methodology developed
by Caner and Hansen (2004), that is using a sample split function of the form (6):

yit = α + λ1d1it ∗ Dit + λ2d2it ∗ Dit + βyit−1 + X(cid:48)

(6)
where d1 and d2 are dummy variables taking on the value 1 if debt is above a given threshold d∗
in case of d1, or if debt is below a given threshold d∗ in case of d2.

itδδδ + µt + νi + it

itγγγ + Z(cid:48)

We exogenously determine the threshold at a level of 90% as this level has been of special
importance in the economic literature and political discussion and estimate the threshold model
(6) using GMM estimator.15 The number of observations above and below the threshold varies
considerable and ranges from 10% above vs. 90% below in case of the medium institutional
quality cluster and 31% above vs. 69% below in case of the countries with poor institutional
quality. Table (7) depicts the respective results for all sub-samples.

The results are very similar to the ﬁndings from the previous linear regression without thresh-
old and the quality of the models is practically identical. The estimated inﬂuence of government
debt on growth above the determined threshold diﬀers only slightly from the estimated coeﬃcient
below threshold.

Altogether the result suggest that the existence of a government debt threshold at a level of
90% of GDP cannot be conﬁrmed. This outcome should not be misinterpreted in the sense that
no threshold exists or the relationship is better approximated by a linear model indeed. In fact,
to exogenously set a threshold at 90% is too short sighted and a mere attempt to test an existing
presumption.
In reality, the level of the threshold might vary between the sub-samples and

15We refrain from testing diﬀerent threshold levels by two simple reason: we focus on the observed heterogeneity

rather than in threshold options and by restriction of space.

should be assumed to be unknown. Further testing using endogenously determined thresholds
are therefore the next step to consider.

6 Concluding remarks

The empirical analysis of the relationship between debt and growth is demanding. Unobserved
parameter heterogeneity can considerably bias the results and might be one of the major problems
in the existing literature.

Addressing heterogeneity by prepending a cluster analysis to detect similarities in the coun-
tries’ institutional quality turns out to be a well-suited approach to address this short-coming.
More complex estimation techniques and model speciﬁcations could potentially account for the
problem of unobserved parameter heterogeneity as well. But these kind of models are increas-
ingly diﬃcult to understand and the results are therefore hard to interpret. This makes them
diﬃcult to translate to a broader audience (e.g. politicians) and to apply to real world situations.
A two-stage procedure, as suggested in this paper, seems more appropriate and has the great
advantage to explicitly disclose the heterogeneity between the countries.

Our approach delivers sound and very promising results. The estimated coeﬃcients for gov-
ernment debt vary considerably between the detected country groups and the quality of the
estimation is in many cases superior to a combined overall estimation. The results are valid
especially for countries that have passed a fair level of institutional quality.

Nevertheless several limitations of the approach still persist and additional investigation on
endogenous threshold, on the channel between institutional quality and the debt-and-growth
relationship, and on further sources of unobserved heterogeneity are necessary. We are convinced
that future research will have to move in this direction.
