Abstract 
This paper provides the first estimates of intra-household consumption allocation in Brazil and evaluates 
individual  poverty  based  on  resources  allocated  to  each  family  member  among  Brazilian  families. 
Building  on  a  collective  model  of  household  consumption  and  using  the  Pesquisa  de  Orçamentos 
Familiares (POF 2008-2009), we also estimate adult economies of scale in households from Brazil. Our 
results show that men‗s  share of total  expenditures is  slightly larger than women's shares for  almost  all 
the family structures considered in our study. The magnitude of children‗s shares is in turn comparatively 
smaller.  Moreover,  we  find  that  standard  poverty  indices  overstate  the  incidence  of  child  poverty.  The 
estimates  also  indicate  substantial  scale  economies  of  living  together  which  affect  poverty  measures. 
Adult poverty is then smaller because parents are highly compensated by the scale economies due to joint 
consumption. Finally, our results establish that the distribution of resources within households is crucial 
to  the understanding of its members‘ material  well-being and for the design of redistributive policies in 
Brazil.

Resumo 

Este trabalho fornece as primeiras estimativas do processo de alocação de consumo intrafamiliar no Brasil 
e avalia a pobreza individual com base nos recursos atribuídos a cada membro do domicílio das famílias 
brasileiras.  Com  base  em  um  modelo  coletivo  de  consumo  das  famílias  e  usando  a  Pesquisa  de 
Orçamentos Familiares (POF 2008-2009), são também estimadas as economias de escala nos domicílios 
do Brasil. Os resultados indicam que a parcela dos gastos totais dos homens é ligeiramente maior do que 
as parcelas das mulheres para quase todas as estruturas familiares consideradas no presente trabalho. Por 
sua  vez,  a  magnitude  das  parcelas  das  crianças  é  comparativamente  menor.  Outros  resultados  também 
mostraram  como  as  medidas  tradicionais  de  pobreza  tendem  a  superestimar  a  incidência  da  pobreza 
infantil. As estimativas também indicam que as economias de escala dos adultos são grandes e afetam as 
medidas  de  pobreza.  Especificamente,  a  pobreza  entre  adultos  é  menor  porque  os  pais  são  altamente 
compensados  pelas  economias  de  escala  decorrentes  do  consumo  conjunto.  Finalmente,  os  resultados 
estabelecem que distribuição dos recursos nos domicílios é importante para a compreensão do bem-estar 
material de seus integrantes e para a formulação de políticas redistributivas no Brasil.

1.  Introduction 
 

Understanding  the  welfare  of  individuals  has  been  one  of  the  central  questions  in  development 
economics.  Two  leading  measures  of  economic  well-being  are  poverty  and  income  distribution  among 
households. Although poverty rates and income concentration have undergone an evident drop in Brazil 
during 2000s3, the country is well known for having one of the highest worldwide inequality levels which

3According to De Souza (2012, p. 7), Brazil‘s GINI Index of the household per capita income has slowly decreased from 0.594 
in 2001 to 0.539 in 2009 indicating a rather significant problem of income disparity. Regarding poverty, from 2004 to 2009 the 
1 

 

has attracted attention of economists from all over the world (KAKWANI et al., 2010; ROEMER, 2013; 
LUSTIG et al., 2013; among others). In this context, the question of poverty intensity becomes relevant 
because it is crucial to assess whether all household members are equally poor or whether some persons 
are disproportionately poor. Hence, ignoring resource allocation behavior within the household can lead 
to failure in targeting the population group of concern in policy and social program designs. 

Despite the voluminous literature on inequality and poverty, there is still a relatively small body of 
research  concerning  the  distribution  of  resources  within  households  and  poverty  at  the  individual  level. 
To account for the intra-household resource allocation process, individual consumption must be used, but 
empirically,  consumption  is  typically  measured  at  the  household  level4.  One  possible  solution  to  this 
problem  is  the  use  of  a  collective  household  model  to  fill  in  the  missing  information  about  the  within-
household  allocation  of  resources5.  Menon  et  al.  (2012)  argued  that,  given  household-level  data,  useful 
measures of individual consumption expenditures are resource shares  (i.e., each member‘s share of total 
household consumption expenditures) which reveal if there is intra-household inequality. Thus, standard 
per-capita calculations assuming equal resource shares to all household members are invalid measures of 
individual  well-being.  Following  an  earlier  literature  dated  back  to  Becker  (1965,  1981)  and  Chiappori 
(1988,  1992),  the  collective  models  have  become  increasingly  popular  for  analyzing  household 
consumption  behavior.  The  more  recent  versions  of  this  approach,  including  Lewbel  and  Pendakur 
(2008), Browning et al. (2013), Dunbar et al. (2013), Bargain and Donni (2012a; 2012b) and Bargain et 
al.  (2014),  rely  on  the  identification  of  resource  shares  from  household-level  expenditures.  This 
identification  is  important  for  many  economic  topics  such  as  welfare  and  poverty  analysis  (e.g., 
DUNBAR  et  al.,  2013,  or  BARGAIN  et  al.,  2014;  CHERCHYE  et  al.,  2015),  and  social-level 
redistribution  or  determination  of  alimony  and  life  insurance  payments  (e.g.,  LEWBEL,  2003; 
ATTANASIO; LECHENE, 2014). 

In  this  paper,  we  provide  estimates  of  the  share  of  household  resources  accruing  to  adults  and 
children, and its implications for the levels of poverty in the Brazilian context. Building on the framework 
developed  by  Bargain  and  Donni  (2012)  and  Bargain  et  al.  (2014),  we  retrieve  the  intra-household 
resource allocation in order to compute a direct measure of individual poverty for Brazil. This approach is 
a generalization of the conventional  Rothbarth-Gronau method6.  In the  context  of developing countries, 
this  method  has  been  used  to  measure  the  cost  of  children  and  the  existence  of  gender  discrimination 
among  children7.  However,  the  disadvantage  of  Rothbarth-Gronau  method  is  that  it  considers 
consumption as a purely private activity. But the consumption of some goods and services is an activity 
partially,  or  completely  collective  (in  the  case  of  household  public  goods)  that  generates  economies  of 
scale in multi-person households.  

                                                                                                                                                                                                            
share of the population with less than a minimum wage per month decreased from 71% to 58%, yet in 2009 the extremely poor 
accounted  for  4.7%  of  the  population  and  the  poor  came  to  almost  9.4%  of  Brazilians  and  people  vulnerable  to  poverty 
amounted to around 44% of the total population (OSORIO et al., 2011). More recent figures indicate that, in 2014, the Brazil‘s 
GINI Index was 0.494, and the rates of extreme poverty and poverty were 2.8% and 7.3% of the population, respectively. See 
Brazil (2015). 
  4 Traditionally, microeconomic theory considers the households as single decision-making units. This so called unitary model 
only  considers  allocation  among  households  and  disregards  questions  concerning  individual  preferences  and  intra-household 
inequalities,  which  may  lead  to  wrong  welfare  implications  (HADDAD;  KANBUR,  1990,  1992).  Unitary  model  has  been 
criticized both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective by several authors who have developed alternatives termed as 
collective approaches to household behavior (BOURGUIGNON; CHIAPPORI, 1992). 
5  The  collective  models  of  household  consumption  are  those  in  which  the  household  is  described  as  a  group  of  individuals, 
each of whom is characterized by particular preferences, and among whom intra-household bargaining and collective decision 
processes are assumed to take place (VERMEULEN, 2002). According to Xu (2007, p. 3), the collective framework explain 
phenomena that cannot be understood under the unitary approach and reshape policy instruments to make social welfare and 
individual development programs more efficient. 
6 As clearly explained in Bargain et al. (2014), the Rothbarth approach ―… is a method that allows retrieving how household 
resources  are  allocated  between  parents  and  children.  It  consists  in  examining  the  extent  to  which  the  presence  of  children 
depresses the household consumption of adult-specific goods‖ (see, particularly, p. 262, and the references therein).

As a benchmark, our study not just deals with the fact that individual allocation within families are 
practically unobserved, but also with the appropriate inclusion of joint consumption8 in the household to 
measure  individual's  welfare.  Our  analysis  thus  implies  that  poverty  rates  often  ignore  not  only  the 
distribution  of  resources  within  households,  but  the  gains  from  joint  consumption.  Alternatively,  using 
anthropometric  information  as  measure  of  individual  welfare,  some  studies  have  revealed  a  significant 
level  of  intra-household  inequality  (e.g,  HADDAD;  KANBUR,  1990;  SAHN;  YOUNGER,  2009)  and 
significant impacts of economic policy on child poverty (e.g, THOMAS, 1990; THOMAS et al., 1996). In 
addition, there is evidence that parent-specific characteristics as well as the resulting pattern of household 
decision-making  power  sharing  can  play  an  important  role  on  the  welfare  of  other  members  of  the 
household, particularly children (e.g., DOSS, 2013). Based on this observation, we estimate a measure of 
resource allocation in a multi-person model consistent with consumption economies of scale and parental 
bargaining.  More  specifically,  our  framework  allows  the  estimation  of  indifference  scales  in  Lewbel 
(2003)‘s  sense9,  and  thereby  to  account  for  the  existence  of  scale  economies  and  for  the  possibly 
diverging opinions of the parents.  

Our results indicate that the differences in consumption behavior between singles and couples can be 
explained by the sizeable scale economies within multi-person households. The empirical findings based 
on our baseline model also show that the parents' expenditures made for children living in the household 
amount to about 20% of the resources for one-child households and 26% for families with four children. 
Regarding the distribution of resources between adults, spouses' education (as well as their age) seems to 
be related to a larger fraction of the total expenditure they receive. The share of total expenditure devoted 
to  household  members  is  positively  related  to  urban  residency,  house  ownership,  white  persons  and 
woman's participation in the labor market (in the case of women and children). In particular, the share of 
total expenditure devoted to children increases with their number and their age, but the average share per 
child tends to decrease. In addition, we do not find evidence of gender discrimination in the allocation of 
resources among children.  

Another interesting finding is that adult's scale economies are large and affect poverty measures. That 
is, adult poverty is smaller because parents are highly compensated by the scale economies due to joint 
consumption. Despite that the children command a reasonably large share of household  resources, such 
share  is  not  enough  to  avoid  having  higher  rates  of  poverty  than  their  parents.  We  also  show  how 
resources  devoted  to  each  household  member  vary  by  family  size  and  structure,  and  we  find  that, 
particularly,  standard  poverty  measures  tend  to  overstate  the  incidence  of  child  poverty.  One  important 
consequence  of  this  is  that  standard  per-capita  poverty  measures,  which  by  construction  ignore  intra-
household  inequality,  present  a  misleading  picture  of  poverty,  particularly  for  children.  Thus,  our 
estimates  are  important  for  redistributive  policy  interventions,  because  they  constitute  more  accurate 
measures  of  the  relative  material  welfare  of  Brazilians  in  households  of  varying  composition. 
Furthermore, the fact that it is plausible to measure of each member‗s resource shares within households 
is a very useful step in measuring actual individual poverty, and thus informing in a more precise way to 
policy makers which are focused on poverty alleviation. 

The  rest  of  our  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  Section  2,  we  present  the  framework  and  the 
theoretical results on which the empirical analysis is based. Section 3 summarizes the functional form, the 
estimation  method,  and  the  process  to  compute  inequality  within  the  household  as  well  as  poverty 

                                                           
8  Joint  consumption  is  the  shared  use  of  commodities  in  multi-person  households,  i.e.  collective  enjoyment  of  goods,  like 
housing, television, fridge, or utilities, which are in the nature of ‗public goods‘ to the family and by which ‗scale economies' 
take  place.  In  family  economics,  household  consumption  can  be  divided  into  private  or  collective  (public)  depending  on  the 
type of good being shared among the household members. This applies to household goods such as furniture, housing, family 
car, home heating/cooling, etc. 
9 In the Lewbel (2003)‘s sense, an indifference scale is a scalar that equates the utility of a person living alone to the utility of 
the same individual if he or she lived with a partner. More generally, an indifference scale represents the income adjustment 
applied to person when living in a multi-person household (with or without children) for her/him to reach the same indifference 
curve as when living alone.

present and discuss the main empirical results. Section 5 concludes. 

2.  Theoretical Framework 

 

We  follow  closely  the  theoretical  framework  of  Bargain  and  Donni  (2012a)  and  Bargain  et  al. 
(2014). Our model assumes three types of households n = 1,2,3 denoting single adults, childless couples, 
and couples with children. Let superscripts k = 1,…,K refer to goods and subscripts i refer to household 
members,  with  i=  m,w,c,  indicating  men,  women,  and  children,  respectively.  Let  x  denotes  the  log 
household expenditure and let p be the vector of log prices. For each individual i living in a household of 
type  n,  there  is  a  set  of  utility  functions,  a  set  of  sharing  functions,  and  a  set  of  scaling  functions.  In 
particular, individual log resources for single-person households (n = 1) is the same as the household log 
expenditure x whereas multi-person households (n > 1) individual log resources (xi,n) is assumed to have 
the following structure: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2.1) 

where log ηi,n > 0 is the logarithm of the share of total expenditure accruing to individual i in household n, 
log si,n > 0 represent the logarithm of the economies of scale associated to this individual's consumption, 
and  z  is  a  vector  of  individual  and  household  characteristics  (such  as  age,  education  or  region  of 
residence).  The  utility  of  individual  i  living  in  a  household  of  type  n  can  be  characterized  by  a  well-
behaved indirect utility function that takes the form:  

   

 

 

 

 

 

(2.2) 

where  zi  is  a  vector  of  individual  characteristics,  with  ηi,n(p,z)  =  si,n(p,z)=  1  if  n  =  1  by  convention.  In 
general, collective models posit that each household member has a utility function. Two important points 
worth  mentioning  in  this  regard:  First,  the  utility  function  vi(∙,p,zi)  of  each  family  member  does  not 
depend  on  the  type  n  of  the  household  once  we  controlled  for  the  sharing  of  total  expenditure  and  the 
existence  of  joint  consumption.  Thus,  scaling  and  sharing  functions  can  explain  the  differences  in 
expenditure  patterns  between  a  person  living  alone  and  an  individual  living  with  other  people.  This 
assumption implies that the individual preferences across household types are stable, as in the Rothbarth 
method  (GRONAU,  1988,  1991;  BARGAIN  et  al.,  2014).  Second,  preferences  of  children  in  the 
household are aggregated into a unique index, which could then be used to  represent the indirect  utility 
function  of  the  children  living  in  the  household.  This  does  not  imply  the  strong  assumption  that  the 
resource shares are equally distributed among children. In effect, the total share of children are allowed to 
depend  on  demographic  characteristics  (z)  which  includes  (among  others)  the  age  of  children  and  the 
number of boys versus girls in order to test for any potential discrimination among children in household 
expenditure. 

The set of sharing functions ηi,n(p,z) allows identifying the intra-household allocation and control of 
resources  among  household  members.  We  employ  a  two-stage  budgeting  decision  process  based  on 
Browning  et  al.  (1994)'s  collective  approach.  Specifically,  household  resources  are  supposed  to  be 
allocated  between  household  members  according  to  some  sharing  rule  at  the  first  stage.  At  the  second 
stage,  each  member  i  maximizes  their  own  utility  function  subject  to  an  individual  budget  constraint 
given  by  the  fraction  of  ηi,n(p,z)  ∙  exp(x),  choosing  in  this  way  consumption  expenditure  vectors.  The 
basic assumption here is that sharing function is independent of household total expenditure, so that the 
resource  shares  depend  on  the  socio-demographic  variables  and,  possibly,  variables  that  capture  the 
relative  bargaining  position  of  the  parents.10  This  assumption  is  made  for  the  sake  of  identification 

                                                           
  10  In  the  literature  on  equivalence  scales,  this  restriction  that  resource  shares  are  independent  of  expenditure  is  known  as 
‗independent of base‘ (IB) scaling of consumption (BLACKORBY; DONALDSON, 1993; LEWBEL, 1991). IB is a function, 
independent  of  total  expenditure  –and,  hence,  of  the  utility  level  –  at  which  it  is  evaluated,  which  scales  the  expenditure  of

restriction  is  potentially  strong,  it  fortunately  can  be  tested  empirically  and  tends  to  be  supported  by 
recent evidence (MENON et al., 2012; BARGAIN al., 2014). 

The  set  of  scaling  functions  si,n(p,z)  characterizes  the  adult  economies  of  scale  and  scope  in 
consumption.  This  functions  must  be  individual-specific11.  Following  Lewbel  and  Pendakur  (2008)  and 
Bargain et al. (2014), we assume that the ‗value‘ of total expenditure is inflated by the presence of several 
persons in the household (e.g., a married couple that always rides together in a car 'will consume' gasoline 
twice) and that economies of scale have a pure wealth effect. That is, scale economies generated by joint 
consumption can be represented by the deflator si,n(p,z). As explained previously, the scale si,n(p,z) < 1 is 
then interpreted as a measure of the cost savings experienced by person i as a result of scale economies in 
the household. The general budget constraint to which the individual consumption behavior is subject can 
be calculated if the Roy's identity is applied to equation (2.2). If we assume that households face constant 
prices, the individual budget shares equation for good k of person i living in household n become then in:

for i = w, m, c,    n = 1, 2, 3, and k = 1,…, K, 

 

where 

 represents the ‗reduced-form‘ budget share on good k of person i in household of type n 

as a function of household (log) expenditure x and household characteristics z and 

(z) = 

is 

a elasticity of the scaling function si,n with respect to the kth price, following the explanation provided in 
Lewbel and Pendakur (2008)12. Household expenditures on each good k can thus be written as the sum of 
individual expenditures on that good. Intuitively, if we divide this identity by the total expenditure exp(x), 
then we obtain the household budget share function for households of any type n as follows: 

 

             

   

(2.4) 

for any good k, with φn the set of indices for all the persons living in a type-n household. 

Two  important  concepts  must  be  clarified,  namely  indifference  scales  and  joint  consumption. 
First, Ii,n(z) = ηi,n(z)/si,n(z) indicates indifference scales, i.e. the adjustment (applied to total expenditure) 
which allows a person living in a multi-person household to reach the same indifference curve as if living 
alone. These scales can be used to compare the welfare of the same individual in two different situations 
and are particularly useful to measure poverty at the individual level. Second, the level of the scale si,n(z) 
cannot be interpreted directly; it must be compared to the level of the corresponding share ηi,n(z), i.e. the 
fraction  of  total  expenditure  which  is  consumed  by  individual  i.  Thus,  a  normalized  indicator  of  the 
‗individual‘ scale economies for each person living in a household of type n ≥ 2 is defined as: 

 

 

 

 

 

     

 

 

(2.5) 

which is equal to 0 in the purely private case and to 1 in the purely public case. The purpose here is to 
identify the main structural components of the model, si,n(z) and ηi,n(z), for i = w,m,c and n = 1,2,3, from 
the  knowledge  of  the  deterministic  components 
.  Finally,  the  fact  that  young  children  are  never 
observed  living  alone  (i.e.,  they  are  always  observed  living  with  their  parents)  implies  that  the  terms 

                                                                                                                                                                                                            
each  individual  in  the  household  and  represents  the  economies  from  joint  consumption  (LEWBEL;  PENDAKUR,  2008; 
BARGAIN et al., 2014). 
11 See Bargain and Donni (2012a) and Lewbel and Pendakur (2008) for recent discussions in detail on this intuition. 
12 The price elasticity 

 is a translation function specific to good k and it is related to the differences that may exist between 

goods with respect to the possibility of joint consumption. Bargain and Donni (2012a, p. 797) point out that scale economies 
may  have  a  wealth  effect  and  a  substitution  effect  represented  by  log  si,n  and 
,  respectively.  This  latter  effect  can  be 

positive or negative depending on the nature of good k, i.e. if good k is essentially public or private.

2.1. Identification strategy 

In  this  section,  we  offer  a  brief  nontechnical  description  of  how  we  identify  each  person‘s  resource 
share  in  the  collective  household.  Technical  discussion  and  formal  identification  proofs  are  in  Bargain 
and Donni (2012a). The main identification result arises from the fact that we observe at least one adult-
specific good for each adult living in the household and utility functions of all the children are aggregated 
into  a  single  representative  index.  Furthermore,  under  some  regularity  conditions  (including  the  non 
linearity of budget share equations with respect to x and the constant prices) and normalization, the main 
parameters (i.e., ηi,n(z) and si,n(z) for i = m, w or c and n = 1,2,3) can be identified from the estimation of 
.  To  account  for  unobserved  factors,  we  add  error  terms  to  the 
the  budget  share  equations 

household  budget  shares: 

  which  is  the  stochastic  extension  of  the  deterministic 

  for  n=1,2,3  and  k=1,  …,  K;  and  where 

component 
  can  be  interpreted  as  optimization  or 
measurement  errors.  Alternatively,  the  stochastic  component  of  the  budget  shares  could  be  seen  as 
resulting from unobservable heterogeneity in the individual budget share equations, in the scales or in the 
resource shares (BARGAIN; DONNI, 2012a).  

Our  identification  strategy  consists  of  three  steps:  (1)  the  basic  budget  share  equations  can  be 
identified from a sample of single women and another of single men since preferences are stable across 
household types n; (2) once basic budget share equations are recovered, the sharing functions and scaling 
functions  for  n  =  2  can  themselves  be  identified  from  a  sample  of  couples  without  children;  (3)  using 
expenditure  on  adult-specific  goods,  the  adults'  sharing  and  scaling  functions  for  n  =  3  can  also  be 
identified  with  the  same  method  as  in  step  2  from  a  sample  of  couples  with  children.  Since  the  basic 
budget  share  equations  of  children  are  unknown,  the  adding-up  condition  of  sharing  functions,  given 
,  has  to  be  exploited  to  identify  the  children's  share.  In  this  light,  the  share  of  total 
by

expenditure  devoted  to  the  child  is  then  obtained  as 

  where  i=m,w  and  the  function 

sc,3(z)=1 for  children. 

3.  Empirical Approach 

3.1. Functional forms 

 

For  our  empirical  application,  we  introduce  an  index  h  for  households  observed  in  the  data.  The 
specification of the model includes the basic budget share equation for the different demographic groups. 
The  individual  preferences  are  assumed  to  be  consistent  with  a  generalization  of  the  PIGLOG  indirect 
utility functions, proposed by Banks et al. (1997). In particular, the specification adopted is: 

         

 

(3.1) 

where xi,n,h = xh + logηi,n,h − logsi,n,h represents the log resources for individual i in household h of type n; 
,  and  µi  are  parameters  and  zi,h  are  socio-demographic  variables.  Specifically,  the  socio-
demographics  variables  include,  in  the  adults‘  case,  age  and  level  of  education  and  dummies  for  house 
ownership, women‘s work participation and urban and regional residency, and in the children‘s case, the 
number  of  children  in  the  household,  their  average  age,  the  proportion  of  boys  and  dummies  for  home 
ownership, urban resident and state of residence. Following Bargain et al. (2014), the socio-demographic 
), and through the 
variables enter the specification through the translation  of budget share equations (

translation  of  log  resources  (µi).  In  the  case  of  multi-person  households  n  ≥  2,  and  non-adult-specific 
goods, the household budget share equations is expressed as

is the error term, 

(⋅,zi,h) individual functions as already specified and three other components 

that are defined as follows. First, the sharing functions are specified using the logistic form: 

 

             

     

(3.2) 

 

 

 

 

for i = m,w,c,       

     

(3.3) 

where 

and 

represent parameters and 

 denotes socio-demographic variables. These latter consist 

of all the variables in zi,h for adults. In the children‘s case, socio-demographic variables comprise all the 
variables in zi,h plus a dummy for mother‘s work participation. For the constants and the parameters of the 
variables  that  enter  several  individual  indices  of  the  logistic  function,  normalization  is  required  and  the 
corresponding coefficients are simply set to zero. We specify σi,n rather than si,n from the inversion of Eq. 
(2.5) in the previous section, the log scaling functions that translate expenditure within the basic budget 
shares are specified as: 

      with  

      for i = m,w, 

     

(3.4) 

and 

are parameters and 

where 
 are socio-demographic variables  (here, they  include only the 
number  of  children,  with  the  restriction  that  σi,n,h ∈  [0,1]).  The  function that  translates  the  basic  budget 
is  price  elasticity.  In  order  to  attempt  measuring  price  effects  and  their  interaction  with 
shares 

demographics, we restrict the derivative of σi,n with respect to log price of good k to be a constant and that 
of ηi,n to be zero. We then compute 

as the derivative of the log of si,n with respect to pk. 

3.2. Estimation method 

 

Our  estimation  method  corresponds  to  the  iterated  Seemingly  unrelated  regressions (SUR) 
in  each  budget  share 

method.  In  order  to  account  for  the  likely  correlation  between  the  error  terms 

function and the log total expenditure, each budget share equation is augmented with the ‗Wu–Hausman 
residuals‘ as in Banks et al. (1997), Blundell and Robin (1999), Bargain and Donni (2012a) and Bargain 
et  al.  (2014).  According  to  Bargain  et  al.  (2014),  these  residuals  can  be  calculated  from  reduced-form 
estimations of x on all exogenous variables used in the model plus some excluded instruments, precisely, 
a polynomial of a convenient degree in household disposable income. Given the budget shares sum up to 
one, equation for good K is unnecessary. The household budget share equations for the K-1 goods and for 
the three demographic groups are estimated simultaneously. Once corrected for endogeneity of log total 
expenditure, the error terms are supposed to be uncorrelated across households and with the demographic 
structure of the household,  but  correlated across  goods within households (BARGAIN; DONNI, 2012a; 
BARGAIN et al., 2014). The perturbation terms are also  assumed to be homoskedastic for each  type of 
household (and covariance matrices are supposed to be different for single males and females). 

 

3.3. Measures of intra-household inequality and individual poverty 

 

We  compute  inequality  within  the  household  using  the  resource  shares  ηi,n(z)  estimated  for  each 
adult  member  and  for  the  children  as  a  whole.  Specifically,  we  calculate  the  amount  of  household 
expenditure accruing to each adult as: 

 

 

for a= w,m and n= 1, 2 3 

 

      

(3.5) 

with log ηi,n(z) = 0 for single individuals. In the children case, the individual expenditure per child, i. e., 
child resources divided by the number of children in the household: 

  

 

for n= 3

for  each  person  in  the  sample  and  compare  it  to  a  poverty  line  that  may  depend  on  the  size  and  the 
composition of the household. Following Dunbar et al. (2013) and Bargain et al (2014), we use the World 
Bank's poverty threshold of US$2 per adult and day and US$1.20 per child and day applied to the entire 
household.  These  poverty  levels  arising  here  are  ―unadjusted‖  poverty  measures  of  adults.  To  test  the 
hypothesis  that  parents  are  highly  compensated  by  joint  consumption,  the  measure  of  adult  poverty  is 
adjusted for economies of scale: 

 

 

for a= w, m and n= 1, 2 3 

 

        

(3.7) 

Based on these measures of individual poverty, poor persons are redefined as poor because the resources 
they receive in the household are below the aforementioned poverty lines (BARGAIN et al, 2014). 

 

4.  Data and sample selection 

 

We use Brazilian household expenditure and demographic data. The information comes from the 
microdata of Pesquisa de Orçamentos Familiares (POF) conducted by  Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia 
e Estatística (IBGE). This is a high-quality household survey that is also used in poverty and inequality 
research (DE SOUZA, 2012). The POF is a cross sectional national survey which gathers information on 
household  expenditures,  incomes  and  socio-demographics  for  55,970  representative  households.  In  our 
empirical analysis, we make use of the most recent available survey for Brazil, namely POF of 2008-2009 
(IBGE,  2010a).  Our  selection  criterion  is  as  follows.  To  begin  with,  we  restricted  the  sample  to 
monogamous,  nuclear  household  (i.e.,  either  adults  living  alone  or  married  couples  with  or  without 
children). Specifically, the family types that we included are single men, single women, childless couples 
and couples with one to four children. This selection drops 25% of the initial sample. These households 
satisfy  the  following  additional  sample  restrictions:  (1)  we  select  households  where  adults  are  aged 
between 20 and 65 years; (2) households with more than one family or unit consumption are excluded; (3) 
we  drop  households  where  children  are  aged  15  or  more  in  order  to  differentiate  children's  clothing 
expenditures from adults ones in the data (since clothing is the central good used in the identification of 
our model)13;  (4) single parents  living  with  children are excluded in  our baseline estimations; (5)  Since 
leisure is not modeled here, but is likely endogenous to consumption (and  hence savings) decisions, we 
restrict our sample to households where men are economically active; (6) observations with any missing 
data on the age or education of members are excluded; (7) we finally exclude households with zero food 
expenditure  together  with  obvious  outlying  observations.  The  final  sample  is  composed  of  9,771 
households (about to 18% of the initial sample)14. 

Our  private  assignable  goods  are  based  on  clothing  expenditures  (i.e.,  one  adult  male-specific 
good and one adult female-specific good). These goods, as well as a residual good, are just what we need 
to  identify  the  main  components  of  the  model.  However,  we  also  consider  other  non-durable  goods  to 
improve  the  efficiency  of  the  estimations  and  to  generate  tests,  namely,  food,  transport,  personal  goods 
and services, household operation and communications or ‗housing‘, leisure goods and services, footwear 
and paraphernalia, and a children-specific good (i.e., child clothing). Table 1 presents a description of the 
variables and goods that we use in the estimations. Specifically, we use observations for K=9 non-durable 
commodities: food, transport, leisure goods and services, male, female and child clothing, footwear and 
paraphernalia,  personal  goods  and  services,  and  household  operation  and  communications  (being  this 
latter commodity the omitted good in the Engel curve system). The system estimation comprises a total of 
20 individual Engel curves, that is, 3 private assignable goods (men, women, and children clothing) and 6 

                                                           
13 In POF of 2008-2009, children's clothing expenditures are defined as the acquisition and rental of children's clothing up to 
14 years (IBGE, 2010a). 
14 This selection can potentially distort our  measures of poverty. However,  we have  some reasons  to believe  that our results 
will not be significantly affected. Indeed, the aggregate poverty rate at the level of our study sample using a traditional poverty 
line (the exact definition of which is given below) amounts to 5.7%, which is of the same order of magnitude as the poverty 
rate in the extended sample including all family types (8.7%). Of course, our results could still be misleading if the distribution 
of resources among selected households is very different compared to the rest of the population.

ownership, residence in an urban location and ethnicity (reference category: non-white). All demographic

5.  Empirical Results 

 

 

Table 2 provides summary statistics of our sample by household type and number of children. We 
observe that the average education level across family types ranging from 7.1 to 8.4 (8.5) years between 
men  (women),  where  8  years  is  the  modal  education  level  for  both.  The  representative  households  are 
composed  of  adults  aged  over  30.  Single  women  are  older  than  single  men,  but  married  women  are 
younger  than  married  men  according  to  the  average  ages  of  men  and  women  in  the  subsamples.  In 
general, household structures analyzed here are constituted by urban residents, with a lower frequency of 
couples  with  four  children  in  urban  areas.  Budget  shares,  in  turn,  show  that  household  operations  and 
communications  are  the  main  items,  representing  more  than  40%  of  household  expenditures.  Another 
important  item  is  food,  which  comprises  of  more  than  20%  of  expenditures  in  households.  These 
descriptive  statistics  are  consistent  with  previous  analysis  using  POF  (2008)  data  (see,  e.g.,  IBGE, 
2010b).

We  will  now  consider  a  Rothbarth  perspective  on  the  variation  in  consumption  when  household 
composition changes. Data reveals that the household budget shares devoted to adult-specific goods tend 
to decrease with the presence of one additional child. For instance, while childless couples allocate 2.8% 
(2.4%) of their budget to female (male) clothing, it drops to 2.2% (1.9%) and 2% (1.8%) in couples with 
one  child  and  two  children  respectively.  The  shifts  in  consumption  patterns  are  in  line  with  notion  that 
children impose economic costs on their parents. The traditional Rothbarth way of thinking then suggests 
that, on average, when the family size becomes larger the parents‘ welfare is likely to be declined due to 
an  income  effect  which  re-allocate  limited  resources  of  the  parents  to  accommodate  children's  needs 
(BARGAIN; DONNI, 2012a; BARGAIN et al., 2014). The budget share of all the public goods (such as 
household  operations  and  transport)  decreases  with  family  size  while  the  budget  share  of  private  goods 
(total clothing and food) increases. These patterns are consistent with the simplest interpretation that the 
economies of scale are significant and different across goods. In fact, it can be interpreted that, to some 
extent, economies of scale generate a wealth effect that shifts consumption from public goods to private 
goods. 

Our  strategy  follows  Bargain  and  Donni  (2012a)  in  assuming  that  the  presence  of  private 
assignable  goods  can  aid  in  the  identification  of  individual  welfare.  In  other  words,  by  observing  how 
expenditures  on  clothing  vary  with  total  expenditures  in  the  sample  of  single-person  households,  it  is 
possible  to  recover  how  total  household  expenditures  on  all  goods  are  divided  up  among  household 
members.  Table  3  presents  monthly  expenditures  on  men's,  women's  and  children‘s  clothing.  Single 
women‘s monthly expenditures on clothing are on average larger than monthly expenditures on clothing 

 

10 

of  single  men.  This  may  reflects  that  women  likely  have  a  more  evident  taste  for  clothing  than  men. 
Married  women  (men)  spend  around  50  (43)  BRL  reais  on  clothing  per  month  while  mothers  (fathers) 
spend  37.4,  35.5,  27.5  and  17  (32.5,  32.7,  26  and  17.7)  BRL  reais  in  households  with  1,  2,  3  and  4 
children respectively. This may implies that, on average, women control a larger proportion of household 
resources than men, except in couples with 4 children where husband spend more than wife on clothing. 
However, we cannot rule out the alternative interpretation that wives drop their expenditure on clothing as 
a consequence of economies of scales.  It  is  imperative to  clarify these controversial  explanations. More 
generally,  it  can  be  confirmed  that  children  represent  a  cost  for  their  parents  due  to  the  fact  that  the 
absolute value of expenditures, as well as the budget clothing shares declines with the number of children.

One  source  of  endogeneity  in  our  setting  is  that  total  expenditures  may  suffer  from  measurement 
error. This source of bias can arouse either because of recall errors, since total consumption is measured 
by asking households to recall their past expenditures, or because of the infrequency of purchases create a 
wedge  between  total  expenditures  and  actual  consumption  (DUNBAR  et  al.,  2013).  Another  important 
issue  is  that  identification  of  sharing  and  scaling  functions  necessitates  that  budget  share  equations  are 
non-linear  in  log  total  expenditure  (BARGAIN;  DONNI,  2012a).  To  check  both  endogeneity  of  total 
expenditure  and  non-linearity  of  budget  share  equations  in  log  expenditure,  we  perform  a  Durbin–Wu–
Hausman  test  on  subsamples  of  each  household  type.  In  a  preliminary  step,  we  perform  reduced-form 
estimations  (not  reported  here)  and  directly  testing  exogeneity  of  log  total  expenditure  through  the 
significance  of  the  Wu–Hausman  residuals  in  the  regressions.  The  budget  shares  for  male  and  female 
clothing  are  then  regressed  on  age,  education,  the  dummies  for  white,  woman's  participation,  house 
ownership  and  urban  residency,  as  well  as  the  log  total  expenditure  and  its  squared  value.  The  Wu–
Hausman residuals are then sequentially added to the explanatory variables of the regression. For all the 
subsamples,  the  results  suggest  that  the  budget  share  equations  show  a  quadratic  pattern.  The  same 
conclusion  is  obtained  by  Banks  et  al.  (1997),  Bargain  and  Donni  (2012a)  and  Bargain  et  al.  (2014). 
Regarding  the  coefficients  of  the  Wu–Hausman  residual,  the  estimates  are  not  markedly  affected  by  its 
introduction  and  it  is  negative  and  significant  in  almost  all  subsamples.  These  results  suggest  that 
expenditure  is  not  exogenous.  Therefore,  the  Wu-Hausman  residuals  must  also  be  included  in  the 
structural Engel curve estimations. 

 

5.1. Estimation of the resource shares and the economies of scales 

 

In this section we use a system which incorporates 7 budget share equations into a completely general 
specification.  The  specification  allows  for  free  variation  of  the  parameters  of  the  functional  form 
discussed  in  Section  3.  Additional  equations  were  used  to  generate  overidentifying  restrictions,  as  in 
Bargain and Donni (2012a)15 and Bargain et al. (2014). By estimating this multiple equation system, it is 
possible to estimate the structural components of the model with significant precision and to check for the 
stability of preferences over consumption (BARGAIN; DONNI, 2012a). The Wu–Hausman residuals for 
log  total  expenditure  and  its  square  are  included  in  each  budget  share  equation.  The  estimates  of  the 
coefficients of the sharing and scaling functions as well as indifference scales are reported in Table 4. We 
essentially consider four variations of the model described above: Model (a) which is the baseline model 
estimated with the sample described in the previous section; Model (b) in which the normalized measures 
                                                           
15  The  model  allows  testing  the  hypothesis  that  preferences  over  consumption  are  stable.  For  this,  we  perform  a  simple 
Breusch-Pagan  test  for  independent  equations.  The  Breusch-Pagan  statistic  for  independence,  which  follows  a  Chi-squared 
distribution  under  the  null  hypothesis,  is  about  to  33,015.  The  null  hypothesis  is  then  rejected  at  the  1%  level.  Thus,  the 
assumption that the parameters for singles and couples are the same seems to be a reasonable approximation.

The  resource  shares  ηi,n(z)  are  computed  at  the  average  point  of  the  sample  for  each  family  type. 
From the Model (a) we see that, for all the family types, the average shares of total expenditure is slightly 
larger for men than for women, except for couples with more than two children. The average men's share 
amounts to 0.526 for childless couples while it amounts to 0.411 and 0.372 for couples with one or two 
children, respectively. These differences between men and women switch in larger families where wife‘s 
share  of  total  expenditure  is  larger  than  the  husband‘s.  In  a  few  words,  men  seem  to  have  the  leading 
voice in childless couples and households with less than three children while in families with at least three 
children, women control a larger fraction of household resources than men. Then, a first suggestive point 
is that the notion created by descriptive data, according to which the fraction of total expenditure received 
by men is smaller than for women can be rejected here.  

                                                           
16 We implement a simple test for the IB restriction, following closely Menon et al. (2012, p. 741). In particular, we pool all 
the  household sizes,  which  would give a test  with  more  statistical power, and estimate  coefficients  from regressions  of each 
individual  resource  share  on  a  linear  and  quadratic  models  in  expenditure  which  include  a  categorical  variable  for  each 
household  size  and  dummies  for  each  federal  unit  of  residence.  The  results  indicate  that  none  of  the  log  expenditure  is 
individually statistically significant. This suggests that the hypothesis that resource shares do not vary with expenditure is not 
violated in these data and thus that identification of resource shares on the basis of IB restriction is valid. 

12 

 

The estimations of resource shares are comparable to those previously obtained in the literature. In 
particular, the results for households with at most two children are in line with Dunbar et al. (2013), who 
found that in Malawi, husband's shares of total expenditure are larger than wife‘s ones in households with 
several children. Our estimates for couples with at least three children in which larger shares are found for 
women  are  consistent  with  Browning,  Chiappori,  Lewbel  (2013)  on  Canadian  data,  Bargain  and  Donni 
(2012a) on  French data  and Bargain  et  al.  (2014) on  Ivorian data. Estimations of the average children's 
share  increase  in  a  plausible  way  with  household  size  ranging  0.20  to  0.42.  Another  relevant  point  to 
mention  when  examining  Model  (a)  in  Table  4  is  that  the  parameters  of  the  scaling  functions  are 
significantly different from 1. This finding may reflect the existence of sizeable economies of scale in the 
household which invalidates the traditional Rothbarth approach (BARGAIN; DONNI, 2012a). If σi,n are 
restricted to be the same for husband and wife as in Model (b), it is interesting to note that the difference 
between  men's  and  women's  shares  of  total  expenditure  is  relatively  less  marked.  This  illustrates  that 
taking  economies  of  scales  that  are  specific  to  both  spouses  into  account  may  explains  notably  the 
differences in women's  and men's expenditure on clothing.  Overall it seems  that the estimates of  scales 
for childless couples are rather large. For instance, women‘s scale for a representative childless couple is 
equal to 0.912; so the cost of living for a married woman is 91.2% of the cost he would experience should 
she  live  alone.  Nevertheless,  economies  of  scale  increase  (i.e.,  deflators  si,n  decrease)  in  larger  families 
(with one or more children) compared to childless couples. 

One  important  contributor  to  household  economies  of  scale  may  be  expenditure  on  household 
operations;  hence  expenditure  on  housing  can  hardly  be  ignored  from  the  analysis  (BARGAIN  et  al., 
2014). The estimations of expenditure shares, scaling factors and indifference scales obtained with Model 
(d) are not significantly or systematically different from those of the other models. In fact, the estimates 
of  Model  (d)  are  practically  identical  to  those  obtained  from  Model  (a).  In  general,  models  (a)  and  (b) 
provide the most precise estimates, judging by the lower magnitude of standard errors. Because of these 
low standard errors together with the facts that the Model (c) is based on too restrictive assumptions and 
the  similarity  of  models  (a)  and  (d),  we  consider  that  the  results  given  by  models  (a)  and  (b)  are  more 
consistent.  

Rejecting Model (c), the average women's share goes to 0.474 and 0.485 for childless couples. The 
proportion of resources devoted to children varies between 0.201 and 0.207 for household with one child, 
between 0.265 and 0.286 for household with two children, between 0.285 and 0.304 for household with 
three children, and between 0.393 and 0.423 for household with four children. Note that the level of the 
total  share  of  household  resources  devoted  to  children  rise  as  the  number  of  children  increases,  but  the 
average share allocated to each child declines. One-child families devote, on average, around 20% of its 
expenditures  to  children‘s  consumption.  With  two  children,  this  share  rises  to  roughly  26%,  with  three 
children,  to  approximately  29%,  and  to  four  children,  to  about  42%.  The  resource  share  per  child  in 
households  with  three  or  four  children  is  around  10%.  These  results  are  in  line  with  those  obtained  by 
Dunbar  et  al.  (2013)  and  Bargain  et  al.  (2014).  Using  the  Model  (a)  in  Table  4,  we  compute  that  for  a 
household  with  one  child,  the  average  fraction  of  total  expenditure  received  by  child  represents  about 
49% of the resource of the mother. This proportion is smaller than the child‘s need of resources estimated 
in the modified OECD scale (i.e., 60% of the need of an adult). Similar results are provided by Bargain et 
al. (2014) on data from Côte d'Ivoire. 

However,  note  that  inequality  at  the  level  of  individual  shares  does  not  necessarily  mean  large 
difference  in  individual  welfare,  since  goods  may  have  a  large  public  component,  and  persons  do  not 
generally  benefit  from  the  same  level  of  joint  consumption  in  the  household  (LEWBEL;  PENDAKUR, 
2008; BARGAIN; DONNI, 2012a; BARGAIN et al., 2014). Indeed, we find substantial scale economies 
of  living  together,  according  to  economies  of  scale  deflators  si,n(z)  in  Table  4,  which    are  considerably 
lower than 1 in most of the cases with the exception of childless couples in Model (b). Recall that si,n(z)  
should  lie  between  ηi,n(z)  (purely  public  consumption)  and  1  (purely  private  consumption).  To  take  an 
example,  a  scale  of  0.587  (resp.  0.534)  for  a  man  (resp.  woman)  living  in  a  couple  without  children  in 
Model  (a)  indicate  that  his  (her)  cost of living in a  couple is  around 59% (resp. 53%) the cost  he  (she) 
would experience if living alone. Hence joint consumption among households is  remarkably large. As a 
consequence, it can be shown the existence of sizeable indifference scales, defined as the ratio of shares 

13 

 

and scales. In Model (a) estimated indifference scales are greater than 0.80 for husband, at least 0.65 for 
wife, and close to one for both spouses with four children. Thus, given the estimates from Model (a), the 
household income must be multiplied by no more than (1.54≈1/0.65) for a woman and (1.19≈1/0.84) for 
man to obtain the same level of welfare in a couple with a child than when alone. Such a woman (man), if 
living alone, would need a fraction 0.888 (0.897) of the couple‘s income to reach the same indifference 
curve as when in couples without children. This implies that single persons would not benefit from these 
important scale economies. The estimated indifference scales in Model (b) for both spouses are close to 
one,  except  for  childless  couples  where  they  are  0.532  and  0.520  for  women  and  men  respectively. 
Following Bargain et al. (2014), we use later these estimated indifference scales, specifically those of the 
model (a) as explained below, for compute poverty measures at the individual level. 

 

5.2. Factors associated with the resource shares and the scale economies 

 

We estimate the effect of demographic variables on the resource shares for the four models. Table 5 
gives estimated parameters of sharing functions. The estimates are consistent across all models. We note 
that several variables are explanatory of the intra-household allocation process. We find that spouses' age 
seems to  be related to  a  larger fraction of the total  expenditure they  receive. The education level  of the 
woman does not much affect the resource shares, but the education level of the man is positively related 
to  the  husband's  share.  It  seems  also  that  the  white  race,  urban  residency  and  house  ownership  are 
positively related to the share of total expenditure devoted to each household member. The effect of urban 
residency on the share of total expenditure devoted to the child, however, is not statistically significant. 

On the other hand, woman's participation in the labor market seems to influence the distribution of 
resources among spouses in the household: an increase in the wife‘s work participation entails a shift of 
the  distribution  of  total  expenditure  from  the  husband  to  the  wife.  If  we  interpret  this  as  due  to  a 
distribution factor, then it can be interpreted that if women have more bargaining power, then their ability 
to  extract  within-household  resources  would  be  larger.  We  also  included  a  measure  of  the  household 
income in the regressors of the sharing functions. This last regressor was dropped due to collinearity with 
the explanatory variables of the men‘s and children‘s indices. We thus observe that, for women, it seems 
that the level of income of the household has a positive effect on wife‘s share, but this effect is not very 
significant  across  the  models.  However,  other  variables  in  the  models  (e.g.,  education,  urban  residency 
and home ownership) can be considered as proxies for household income. 

Regarding  the  distribution  of  resources  between  children,  as  the  number  and  the  average  age  of 
children  increases,  the  total  share  of  household  resources  devoted  to  them  goes  up.  These  results  are 
consistent with Dunbar et al. (2013) and Bargain et al. (2014). The fraction of total expenditure received 
by boys is relatively smaller than for girls but the effect is not statistically significant. This result suggests 
that there is no evidence of discrimination in favor of boys. In contrast, Rose (1999) Bargain and Donni 
(2012a) and Dunbar et al. (2013) show that discrimination in favor of boys is revealed by the structure of 
consumption17.  Our  results  are  in  line  with  those  obtained  by  Deaton  (1989)  and  Bargain  et  al.  (2014) 
who  found  no  evidence  of  child  gender  bias  in  the  overall  treatment  of  boys  and  girls  in  Côte  d'Ivoire. 
The  effect  of  the  white  race,  mother's  work  participation  and  house  ownership  on  the  share  of  total 
expenditure devoted to children, on the other hand, is positive and statistically significant. 

 
Table 6 shows the estimated parameters of the scaling functions. In model (a) economies of scale 
seem  to  be  more  favorable  to  men  and  dependent  of  the  number  of  children.  In  particular,  joint 
consumption  for  husbands  (resp.  wives)  represents  roughly  50%  (resp.  45%)  of  the  consumption  of  the 
other  members  in  the  household.  Economies  of  scale  are  expected  to  increase  in  families  with  children 
compared to childless couples. 

 

                                                           
17 The presence of child gender bias in these latter studies might be attributed to cultural aspects of such countries. On the other 
hand,  evidence  of  gender  discrimination  among  children  in  developing  countries  often  pertains  to  long-term  expenditure  on 
children,  especially  ‗productive‘  investments  on  children‘s  education  and  health  (Sen,  1981).  However,  the  literature  on 
differences in education and health expenditures is extensive and beyond the scope of our study.

Although reasonable in magnitude, these parameters of scale economies are not very precisely estimated 
because they are not very statistically significant and there is a fair amount of instability in their estimates 
across  models.  For  these  reasons,  we  believe  that  the  results  given  by  model  (a)  are  more  reliable.  In 
particular,  the  baseline  model  provides,  in  our  opinion,  the  most  precise  scale  economy  parameter 
estimates because it is based on less restrictive assumptions and it is more statistically powerful than the 
other models. Yet,  even this model's standard errors are uncomfortably large. Thus, in what follows we 
only consider model (a) for the analysis of poverty at individual level. 

 

5.3. Individual poverty rates 

 

Considering first the empirical results described so far, we estimated the levels of resource shares and 
the marginal effects of various demographic factors on them. Although estimated shares tell us how total 
expenditure is allocated among persons in reference households, they do not automatically reflect needs 
of  each  individual  or  intra-household  inequality  in  terms  of  welfare.  On  the  other  hand,  resource 
allocations could change across household sizes due to the fact that the demographic factors  themselves 
covary with household size (DUNBAR et al., 2013). Thus, to evaluate the implications of our estimations 
on  the  distribution  of  individual  consumption  for  the  different  family  members,  it  is  illustrative  to 
consider the allocation of total expenditure shares in households of different sizes. For the reasons stated 
in the previous section, we focus on our baseline model.  

The upper panel of Table 7 presents a few summary statistics on the sharing of total expenditure for 
people in households of different composition. It is worth noting that the minima and maxima values of 
resource shares do not fall outside the range between zero and one for any person in any household in the 
sample. As Table 13 shows, the dispersion of resource shares is relatively large. To take an example, the 
total expenditure share of a women living in a childless couple varies between 0.351 and 0.715 depending 
on the demographic variables. The distribution of shares of men and children are also largely dispersed. 
Nevertheless, total expenditure shares do not necessarily include unobserved heterogeneity (BARGAIN et 
al., 2014). One possible interpretation is then that the effects of the demographic variables are important 
on resource shares. Hence, these factors are as important as the household sizes themselves. This justifies 
that  it  is  pertinent  not  only  identify  the  level  of  resource  shares  but  their  response  with  respect  to 
demographic variables. 

Two different approaches have tried to measure  poverty at individual level based on the distribution 
of resources within households, namely the models of Dunbar et al. (2013) and Bargain et al. (2014). In 
this respect, these two approaches are similar in using the total expenditure shares and comparing them to 
the  World  Bank's  poverty  threshold  of  US$2  per  day  for  adults  and  US$1.20  per  day  for  children 
(according  to  the  OECD  estimate  of  the  relative  needs  of  children,  i.e.,  60  %  that  of  adults).  We  thus 
follow these two studies and use such poverty thresholds applied to our sample of households. Firstly, in 
the lower panel of Table 13 we report under the label of ‗household poverty‘  and based on the standard 
headcount  ratio,  the  estimated  poverty  rates  for  households  of  different  sizes  and  composition.  These 
measures assume that each household member gets an equal share of household income. In general, we 
observe that poverty tends to systematically increase with household size or with the number of children. 
In  particular,  poverty  ranges  from  5.6%  of  single  men  and  3%  of  single  women  to  9.1%  of  childless 
households  and  18%,  26%,  44%  and  64%  of  households  with  one,  two,  three  and  four  children, 
respectively. Yet it is unclear why singles are remarkably less affected by poverty than couples. 

To  disentangle  these  patterns  of  distribution  across  households,  it  may  be  necessary  to  account  for 
inequality within the household. For this, we use our estimates of the resource shares ηi,n(z) to construct 
individual-level expenditures. Specifically, we calculate the amount of household expenditure accruing to 
each individual (i.e., household expenditure times the resource share) and compare this to the thresholds 
of  US$2  per  day  for  each  adult  and  US$1.20  per  day  for  each  child.  We  first  compute  the  individual 
resources for each person in the sample and then aggregate into poverty rates at the individual level. The 
lower panel of Table 7 provides these measures referred to as men's, women's and children's (unadjusted) 
poverty levels. We can see that the poverty rates are also lower for singles than for adults in couples with 
and without children. Table 7 also reports the level of poverty adjusted for scale economies. In all cases, 
we observe a stunning decrease in poverty levels among adults in couples. For example, for women (resp. 
16 

 

men)  in  childless  couples  the  poverty  rate  drops  from  17.7%  (resp.  11.2%)  to  2.4%  (resp.  2%).  The 
reduction  in  poverty  rates  is  larger  for  married  women  than  for  men  in  couples  in  almost  all  cases; 
couples with 3 and 4 children indicate the contrary. In terms of joint consumption, the poverty decline is 
compatible  across  all  types  of  households  and  with  the  gender  differences  in  scale  economies  stated  in 
previous section. These results compare well to those of Bargain et al. (2014), in which the poverty rates 
of adults living alone and in a family are of the same order of magnitude because the fact that adults in 
families  must  share  resources  is  compensated  by  the  gains  from  joint  consumption  (i.e.,  economies  of 
scale).

It  is  worthwhile  to  note  that  the  per  capita  measures  overstate  poverty  levels  among  adults  and  the 
incidence  of  child  poverty,  mainly  for  large  families18.  Overall,  child  poverty  level  goes  up  with  the 
number  of  children  and  it  ranges  from  6.4%  for  one-child  household  to  55%  in  households  with  four 
children. In particular, for one-child families the incidence of child poverty (6.4%) is of the same order of 
magnitude as women‘s poverty with adjustment for scale economies (6.2%). This might either reflect that 
children's needs are not necessarily those assumed in the OECD scale applied to the poverty line  or that 
there is limited redistribution from parents to their child (BARGAIN et al., 2014). However, poverty rates 
are dramatically higher for  larger families, i.e. more than 10%, 40% and 50% for households with  two, 
three and four children, respectively. Although the high child poverty rates could over-estimate the child 
needs,  we  cannot  rule  out  the  possibility  that  the  allocation  of  resources  skewed  in  favor  of  adults  in 
larger families explains the gap between one-child households and larger households (BARGAIN et al., 
2014).  This  finding  underlines  that  the  expenditure  per  child  tends  to  systematically  decrease  with  the 
number of children. By comparison, Bargain et al. (2014) find that the per capita children's shares become 
smaller  in  families  of  several  children  compared  to  one-child  families  in  Côte  d'Ivoire.  Dunbar  et  al. 
(2013) drew the same conclusion in Malawi. Alternatively, it is possible that larger families may benefit 
from  large  economies  of  scale  among  children  because  they  can  share  child  specific  goods  (e.g.,  food, 
toys or clothes). For this reason, the increase in  child poverty among larger families could  be narrowed 
due  to  the  existence  of  scale  economies  induced  by  joint  consumption  among  children.  However,  these 
economies  of  scale  are  not  modeled  here  and,  therefore,  results  regarding  children‘s  poverty  levels  in 
Table 7 must be interpreted with caution. One way to put into a context our results of poverty rates is to

compare them to previous calculations for Brazil. For example, Osorio et al. (2011) found that in 2009 the 
income poverty level among adults aged between 19 and 64, and children aged 14 or younger was around 
7.2% and 26.4%, respectively. Osorio et al. (2011, p. 26) also found that poverty rate is about 3.5% for 
childless  families,  while  it  amounts  to  14.6%  (62.8%)  for  persons  living  in  households  with  1-3  (4  or 
more children). 

6.  Final Remarks 

 

In this paper we estimate the share of total expenditure accruing to children and adults, as well as 
poverty  at  individual  level  in  Brazil  using  a  model  consistent  with  scale  economies  and  parental 
bargaining. Note that this contribution is one of the rare applications of a collective model that reassess 
these  issues  in  a  developing  country.  We  conducted  a  joint  estimation  on  pooled  sample  of  single 
individuals, childless couples and couples with 1-4 children, and we applied it for three types of persons 
(men, women, and  young children). Clearly, we  have limited the application  of our approach to  singles 
and  couples  with  0-4  children.  In  order  to  measure  how  our  estimations  change  with  the  household 
structure and size, it would be easy to extend our framework to more diversified demographic structures. 
This  constitutes  an interesting  path  for  future  research.  Our  main  results provide  evidence  of  inequality 
and economies of scale within Brazilian households, which leads us to the rejection of the unitary model 
as  well  as  the  traditional  Rothbarth-Gronau  approach  for  Brazil.  Our  findings  also  indicate  that  men‘s 
share  of  total  expenditures  is  slightly  larger  than  women's  shares  for  almost  all  the  family  structures 
considered here. The magnitude of children‘s shares, interpreted as the cost of children for the parents, is 
in turn comparatively smaller.  In addition, we find that mothers seem to contribute more resources than 
fathers  to  children,  and  we  do  not  find  evidence  of  gender  but  age  differences  in  children‘s  resource 
shares.  Also,  results  provide  evidence  indicating  that  women‘s  bargaining  power  within  the  household 
improves with their age, level of education and participation in the labor market.  

Overall,  the  empirical  analysis  we  report  suggests  that  ignoring  intra-household  inequalities 
affects the assessment of levels of poverty. In particular, the neglect of unequal distribution of resources 
among  household  members  leads  to  a  large  overestimation  of  child  poverty.  However,  child  poverty 
levels are computed based on the differentiation in individual needs across household members, but they 
do not take joint consumption among children into account. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that 
our results might still overestimate the incidence of child poverty. In particular, the levels of child poverty 
may be apparently high due to two reasons. As noted above, the empirical model does not include scale 
economies from joint consumption among children in households. Furthermore, with the method we use, 
the information on the household production is not incorporated in the collective model framework. This 
may be a source of bias in our estimations. Indeed, omitting the household production would imply that 
the rate of child poverty in the sample is higher than in the corresponding population. If this is the case, 
our estimations may be incapable of capturing adequately children's total expenditure shares and may lead 
us  to  wrongly  ignore  if  children  consume  relatively  more  of  the  goods  produced  within  the  household. 
These last issues deserve more research work. Given its preliminary nature, the present study allows for 
many possible extensions. For instance, the incorporation of the scale economies among children in these 
models is one of the major challenges for future research. On the other hand, we acknowledge that scaling 
factors,  interpreted  as  economies  of  scale  in  households,  may  capture  not  only  changes  in  individual 
preferences  but  consumption  externalities  across  household  types.  In  order  to  better  understand  these
