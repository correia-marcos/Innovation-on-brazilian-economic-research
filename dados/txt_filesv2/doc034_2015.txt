Abstract 

This paper aims to analyse the structural transition undertaken by Brazil and South Korea from the 1950s to 
2000s in terms of sectoral diversification in a inter and intra-sectoral perspective. Additionally, through the 
so-called  structural  decomposition  analysis  (SDA)  was  investigated  factors  which  contributed  to  the 
movement  of  specialisation  observed  in  these  economies.  Moreover,  the  paper  consolidated  the 
understanding of the structural economic dynamics via movements related to the density of industrial chains. 
The main findings of this study showed that, (i) Brazil was affected by a process o premature specialisation 
in inter and intra-sectoral levels; (ii) South Korea increased sharply the share of medium/high-sectors in the 
economy while Brazil although more diversified, remained dependent of less dynamic sectors; (iii) The SDA 
methodology revealed the output growth of manufacturing was much more intense than in Brazil, particularly 
from 1995 to 2003. Furthermore, from 1995 to 2008, South Korea output growth in South Korea was pulled 
mainly  by  Exports,  while  in  Brazil  from  2003  to  2008  the  domestic  demand  composed  the  main  source  of 
economic  dynamism;  (iv)  During  2003  to  2008  both  countries  registered  a  significant  rise  of  imported 
coefficients in the domestic production, but with distinct impacts over the share of manufacturing in the total 
value added.

Resumo 

Este  artigo  tem  como  objetivo  analisar  a  transição  estrutural  empreendida  pelo  Brasil  e  Coréia  do  Sul  da 
década de 1950 aos anos 2000 em termos de diversificação setorial em uma perspectiva inter e intra-setorial. 
Adicionalmente, através da chamada análise de decomposição estrutural (ADS) foram investigados os fatores 
que  contribuíram  para  o  movimento  de  especialização  observado  nessas  economias.  Ademais,  o  artigo 
consolidou o entendimento da dinâmica estrutural da economia via movimentos relacionados à densidade de 
suas cadeias produtivas. As principais conclusões do estudo mostraram que, (i) O Brasil foi afetado por um 
processo de especialização precoce em nível inter e intra-setorial; (ii) A Coreia do Sul aumentou nitidamente 
a participação de setores de media/alta tecnologia na economia enquanto o Brasil, embora mais diversificado, 
permaneceu  dependente  de  setores  menos  dinâmicos;  (iii)  A  metodologia  de  (ADS)  revelou  que  o 
crescimento  da  produção  da  manufatura  na  Coreia  do  Sul  foi  muito  mais  intenso  que  no  Brasil, 
particularmente de 1995 até 2003. Ademais, de 1995 até 2008, o crescimento da produção na Coreia do Sul 
foi especialmente puxado pelas exportações, enquanto no Brasil de 2003 até 2008 foi a demanda domestica 
que  compôs  a  principal  fonte  de  dinamismo  econômico;  (iv)  Durante  2003  até  2008  ambos  os  países 
registraram um significante aumento dos coeficientes de insumos importados para produção domestica, mas 
com distintos impactos sobre a participação da manufatura no valor adicionado total.

Introduction2 

 
Despite  of  the  Brazilian  economic  boom  from  2002  until  the  global  financial  crisis  of  2008,  the 
neoliberal  shock  of  the  1990s  produced  deleterious  economic  changes.  The  country  faced  a  productive 
disarticulation  and  the  absence  of  sustained  economic  growth.  In  a  “stop  and  go”  performance,  the 
manufacturing sector has gradually decreased. In this process the domestic industrial chains has shrunken and 
been  affected  by  ‘predatory’  imports.  In  other  words,  imported  inputs  played  a  substitutive  role  in  the 
productive  chain.  Moreover,  the  economy  has  exposed  a  specialisation  in  less  dynamic  sectors  such  as 
services  and  commodities.  Furthermore,  in  terms  of  trade,  the  economy  has  increased  its  dependence  on 
exports of primary products, i.e., commodities which in turn affected negatively the Brazilian trade pattern.  

 
In  South  Korea,  along  the  same  period,  were  also  adopted  reforms  regarding  trade  and  financial 
liberalisation.  However,  the  economic  reforms  were  totally  different  to  the  messianic  endeavour  seen  in 
Brazil.  In  fact,  economic  reforms  in  South  Korea  were  much  more  pragmatic  in  order  to  continue  and 
strength the existing ambitious strategy of industrialisation. Even during de Asian crisis in 1997, despite of 
the  re-articulation  between  State  and  private  sector,  the  whole  of  the  State  remained  fundamental.  To 
overcome  the  crisis  there  was  a  reorganization  of  the  corporate  structure  with  processes  of  mergers  and 
acquisitions  gaining  momentum.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  at  no  time  the  manufacturing  sector 
was  neglected.  Therefore,  the  South  Korean  State  remained  active  promoting  the  consolidation  and 
expansion  of  the  industrial  structure  and  exports.  In  this  process  imports  of  inputs  had  fundamentally  a 
complementary  role  in  the  productive  process.  Moreover,  in  a  strategy  of  productive  and  trade  upgrading, 
South  Korea  took  advantage  of  the  special  properties  of  manufacturing  as  engine  of  growth.  Not  by 
coincidence, the South Korean economic growth has been higher and much more sustainable when compared 
to the Brazilian economy.  

 
Therefore,  inserted  in  this  short  background,  this  paper  seeks  to  analyse  the  structural  transition  of 
Brazil and South Korea. Through the input-output framework, in a comparative perspective, the paper makes 
an  effort  to  investigate  these  economies  regarding  their  pattern  of  productive  diversification,  structural 
transition and density of industrial chains. Therefore, the contributions of this paper to the existing literature 
are threefold. First, the paper adopt the methodology proposed by Imbs and Wacziargs (2003) in an inter and 
intra-sectoral  perspective  to  indentify  the  path  of  economic  diversification  undertook  by  Brazil  and  South 
Korea over the decades. Second, in a complementary analysis, the input-output framework is used to identify 
and  quantify  factors  that  contributed  to  this  pattern  of  specialisation.  The  method  used  was  based  on  the 
Structural  Decomposition  Analysis  (SDA)  inspired  particularly  by  Chenery’s  studies.  Third,  the  paper 
advances in the input-output methodology employed by Rocha (2011) to estimate imported input coefficients 
for Brazil and South Korea through the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). 

 
Therefore,  the  paper  is  organised  as  follows.  First  section  discuss  the  long-lasting  debate  about 
specialisation or diversification and apply the method proposed by Imbs and Wacziarg (2003) to investigate 
the stages of sectoral diversification presented by Brazil and South Korea over the decades. In this part is also 
described the methodology, including database and level of sectoral aggregation. Second section focuses on 
the  sectoral  composition  of  manufacturing  in  these  economies  and  their  economic  dynamism  in  a  global 
perspective. Third section through the so-called structural decomposition analysis (SDA) investigates distinct 
factors, i.e. demand, trade and technological change, which contributed to the movement of structural change 
observed in these economies. In the fourth section, the paper consolidates the understanding of the structural 
economic  dynamics  via  movements  related  to  the  density  of  industrial  chains.  Fifth  section  concludes  the 
paper.

1.  Structural change and economic dynamic: Specialization vs. Diversification 

 
The  neoclassical  view  stresses  that  specialisation  based  on  comparative  advantages,  whatever  its 
nature, was a superior solution for economic growth. In this thinking, through the process of specialisation, 
resources  become  more  efficiently  allocated  and  consequently  countries  are  mutually  benefited  in  terms  of 
welfare  (Krugman  and  Obstfeld,  2006).  Influential  neoclassical  visions  such  as  Schultz,  (1964),  Lipton 
(1968)  and  Chayanov  (1966)  grounded  their  analyses  on  the  neoclassical  theory  of  comparative  advantage 
and recommended that late development countries (LDC) should specialise in the production and exports of 
primary commodities and import manufactured products from industrialised economies. Although the idea of 
comparative advantage has received further developments in the current mainstream approach, particularly in 
the New Structural Economics (NSE) framework, specialisation according to the country’s factor endowment 
structure continues to be an integral part of policy advice (Lin, 2012). As pointed out by Rodrik (2004, p. 6) 
many  economists  that  “associate  underdevelopment  with  inadequate  exposure  to  international  markets 
generally imply – although this is often left unstated – that specialization according to comparative advantage 
is an essential ingredient of development”. Currently this understanding is also supported by the World Trade 
Organization  (WTO)  which  advocates  in  favour  of  market  friendly  policies.  The  WTO  (2009)  states  that 
“countries prosper first by taking advantage of their assets in order to concentrate on what they can produce 
best,  and  then  by  trading  these  products  for  products  that  other  countries  produce  best.  Moreover, 
specialization  on  comparative  advantages  through  liberal  policies  would  sharp  competition,  motivate 
innovation and breed success. 

  In  a  critical  perspective,  the  Structuralist-Kaldorian  view  points  out  the  limitations  of  a  strategy  of 
economic  development  based  in  comparative  advantages.  Therefore,  based  in  the  argument  that 
diversification  in  manufactured  products  is  the  main  engine  of  growth,    authors  such  as  Rosenstein-Rodan 
(1943),  Prebisch  (1949),  Lewis  (1954),  Rostow  (1952),  Furtado  (1961),  Hirschman  (1958),  Kaldor  (1966; 
1967) and Chenery (1960; 1979) belong to the handful of economic thinkers that emphasised the importance 
of  diversification  to  economic  development.  According  to  them,  development  is  essentially  a  process  of 
structural change. In other words, sustained economic growth is associated with the capacity to diversify the 
structure of domestic production, i.e. generate new activities to expand possibilities of production, linkages 
and  higher  value-added  goods  by  providing  incentives  to  manufacturing.  According  to  Kaldor  (1966), 
economic  growth  is  brought  about  by  shifting  productive  sectors  with  decreasing  returns  to  those  with 
increasing  returns.  This  shift  creates  dynamic  economies  of  scale  and  triggers  a  process  of  cumulative 
causation in the economy. The author states that manufactured goods is the one with the greatest capacity to 
do  so  and  therefore  its  expansion  plays  a  key  role  in  promoting  sustainable  growth  in  the  long  term  and 
consequent modernization and diversification of the production structure.  

1.1. The U-shaped curve for Brazil and South Korea 

Recently  this  long-lasting  debate  about  economic  specialisation  or  diversification  was  approached  by 
empirical studies that tried to modelling the trajectory of economic diversification undertook by a vast range 
of  economies.  In  an  important  paper,  Imbs  and  Wacziarg  (2003)  investigated  the  stages  of  sectoral 
diversification  in  a  large  cross-section  of  countries.  Using  OECD,  ILO  and  UNIDO  databases,  this  study 
employed a non-parametric methodology based on locally robust weighted scatter plot smoothing (Lowess) 
to identify regularities about the process of productive diversification. Thus, the authors detected a non-linear 
relationship between specialization and GDP per capita, described as U-curve.  

In  this  U-shaped  curve,  low-income  countries  present  a  very  specialised  productive  structure.  As 
countries  move  from  low  to  medium  levels  of  income,  diversification  takes  place  in  the  economy.  This 
process goes on until relatively late in the process of economic development. On average, the diversification 

takes place until the country reaches a turning point around $ 9,000 GDP per capita. Thereafter, the sectoral 
distribution  exhibits  re-specialisation  with  the  curve  presenting  an  ascendant  trajectory.  From  this 
perspective,  as  pointed  out  by  Rodrik  (2004),  Imbs  and  Wacziargs’  findings  suggest  that  specialisation 
according  to  comparative  advantage  conventionally  understood  cannot  be  the  driving  force  of  economic 
development. In other words, countries growth and reach a high level of income per capita during the phase 
of diversification and not specialisation.  

 
Therefore,  seeking  to  evaluate  the  movement  of  structural  change  undergone  by  Brazil  and  South 
Korea,  in  a  comparative  perspective,  this  section  employed  the  Imbs  and  Wacziargs  methodology  to 
investigate these economies both intersectoral, i.e., between primary sector, manufacturing, civil construction 
and  services,  as  well  as,    intra-sectoral  (among  manufacturing  subsectors)3.    In  order  to  calculate  the 
economy inter-sectoral curve of specialization, the GGDC 10-Sector Database and the IBGE database were 
used  to  South  Korea  and  Brazil  respectively.  For  the  intra-sectoral  analysis  to  South  Korea,  the 
manufacturing value added of 23 subsectors from the UNIDO database was used. In the case of Brazil, due to 
lack of long-term data, this study used the ECLAC-PADI database with 28 manufacturing subsectors. Since 
this  paper  seeks  to  compare  Brazil  and  South  Korea,  both  databases  were  aggregated  in  a  common  level 
involving  14  manufacturing  subsectors.  Additionally  to  the  same  aggregation  level,  figures  3.3  and  3.4 
presents two distinct graphics. The first graph plots the Gini-Hirschman index (GHI) against GDP per capita, 
along  with  a  non-parametric  Lowess.  The  second  shows  the  sectoral  share  between  primary  sector, 
manufacturing, civil construction and services. The graphs are presented together to investigate particularities 
regarding the process of economic diversification and structural change undergone by these economies.  

 
In  an  inter-sectoral  view,  based  in  a  developmental  premise  that  industrialisation  in  general  and 
manufacturing specifically is a central condition to economic development, South Korea raised constantly its 
share  of  manufacturing  followed  by  a  substantial  decrease  of  the  primary  sector.  From  1953  to  2010  the 
former  rose  320.7%  while  the  latter  fell  93.7%. Moreover,  a  joint  analysis  between  data  from  the  curve  of 
diversification  and  sectoral  share  of  the  economy  revealed  that  the  movement  of  intersectoral  structural 
change  pursued  by  South  Korea  followed  two  stages  of  manufacturing  expansion.  In  the  first  stage,  from 
1953 to 1980, South Korea moved to a strategy of economic diversification expanding remarkably not only 
the  manufacturing  sector  but  also  civil  construction  (and  strongly  services  during  the  1950s).  During  this 
period manufacturing rose 236.6%, while civil construction increased 337.9% and services 13.3%. Thus, in 
the end of the 1980s the South Korean economy achieved a considerable degree of diversification. 

 
In  the  second  stage,  from  1980  to  2010,  although  the  pace  of  structural  change  decreased,  with 
manufacturing  and  services  growing  respectively  25.1%  and  17.6%,  the  economy  engendered  a  process  of 
economic specialisation. The share of services and manufacturing from the begging to the end of this stage 
clarifies the magnitude of this trajectory. While in 1980 manufacturing and services together accounted for 
approximately 74% of the economy value added, in 2010 this number jumped sharply to 90%.  It was only 
possible  because  the  expansion  of  both  sectors  took  place  mainly  by  the  reduction  of  the  primary  sector. 
Even  during  the  decades  of  1990s  and  2000s,  the  clear  rise  of  services  was  not  followed  by  a  loss  in 
manufacturing.  Therefore,  the  figure  3.2  illustrates  clearly  that  despite  of  the  large  share  of  services  in  the 
economy, South Korea has perused a pattern of specialisation based in the expansion of the manufacturing 
sector.

In  a distinct trend to South Korea,  Brazil did not present the same process of structural change and 
productive diversification for the period analysed. As a matter of fact, the country smoothed data did not fit 
well to the U-shaped curve. However, two import issues must be considered. Firstly, an important period of 
economic  diversification  not  captured  by  the  data  was  engendered  by  the  Brazilian  economy  during  the 
1930s and 1940s. In other words, as widely documented in the Brazilian economic literature, the process of 
economic  diversification  was  initiated  in  the  1930s  after  the  great  world  economic  crisis  in  1929.  At  that 
time, Brazil moved from a primary export model to a strategy of Import Substitution Industrialisation (ISI). 
Secondly, despite an upward sloping, the country maintained a diversified inter-sectoral productive structure 
until the first half of the 1970s. As a matter of fact, from 1950 to practically 1980, the share of manufacturing 
and civil construction grew respectively 67.6%, 66.6%, while the primary sector and services dropped 54.7% 
and 3.5%. Moreover the GDP per capita expanded continually.  

 
However,  with  the  outbreak  of  the  debt  crisis  (in  1982)  and  rise  of  neoliberal  policies,  Brazil 
embarked  in  a  regressive  trajectory.  From  1980  to  2010,  not  only  manufacturing  and  civil  construction 
declined sharply in terms of GDP share (around 48.1% and 18.6% respectively) but also income per capita 
regressed in many periods like 1981-1983, 1988-1992, and 1998-1999. In this sense, Brazil different to South 
Korea  did  not  expose  the  same  long-term  dynamism  in  manufacturing  and  GDP  per  capita  growth. 
Additionally,  one  of the most impressive  effects  of  marked  friendly  policies,  intensified  during  the  second 
half of the 1990s, were the collapse of manufacturing share in the total GDP. The economy gradually lost the 
manufacturing  sector  to  the  point  of  present  a  lower  share  than  in  1950.  The  figure  3.2  illustrates  these 
processes.

As  aforementioned  the  intra-sectoral  movement  inside  manufacturing  was  also  analysed.  As  it  is 
possible to see in the Figure 3.3, both Brazil and South Korea exposed a U-Shaped trajectory. However, in a 
comparative perspective, the U-Shaped pattern also presented three important differences. First, the phase of 
economic  diversification  was  more  intense  in  South  Korea.  Second,  in  terms  of  value  added,  the  South 
Korean economy showed the point of maximum diversification in 1988 with $7,621 GDP per capita4, while 
in Brazil it occurred in 1975 with $4,187 GDP per capita. After these stages both economies engendered an 
ascendant  and constant trend of re-specialisation.  Nevertheless,  as showed by the  Figure 3.3, South Korea 
after 1988 specialised its manufacturing in subsectors that enabled a substantial increase in terms of GDP per 
capita. Thus, from 1988 to 2008 the GDP per capita increased 168.8%, reaching $ 20,482 in 2008. In the case 
of  Brazil,  the  premature  trajectory  of  re-specialisation  culminated  in  a  less  dynamic  productive  structure 
that trapped  the  economy into  a  'low-growth  landscape'.  From  1975  to  2008  the  GDP  per  capita  increased 
only  54.7%  and  the  economy  exposed  a  chronic  dynamic  of  ‘stop  and  go’.  The  following  section  analyses 
manufacturing subsectors and their evolution over time.   

 

 

 

                                                            
4  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  turning  point  to  a  trajectory  of  re-specialisation  is  significantly  lower  than  those  observed  in 
advanced countries. For more details see Imbs and Wacziarg (2003).

1.2. Sectoral composition and economic dynamism  

 
Another dimension that deserves a close analysis to understand the path of specialisation undertaken 
by the Brazilian and South Korean manufacturing industries in relation to the GDP per capita is the evolution 
of  this  process  over  time.  In  this  context,  simply  taking  into  account  the  share  of  each  manufacturing 
subsector in the total value added and specialisation indexes over decades is possible to trace the pattern of 
specialisation underway in this economies. Moreover, through this analysis is also possible to investigate the 
pattern  of  specialisation  in  terms  of  technology  intensity.  Therefore,  starting  in  1990,  table  3.1  shows  the 
evolution of sectoral composition of the manufacturing value added in Brazil and South Korea, at an interval 
of five years in each decade. 

The  trajectory  of  intra-sectoral  specialisation  in  South  Korea  was  marked  by  a  significant  drop  of 
 
low-tech sectors into the economy compensated by a strong expansion in high sectors. From 1990 to 2008, 
the  former  slumped  from  33.2%  to  13.9%  while  the  latter  increased  sharply  from  43.4%  to  59.3%.  In  this 
trend, the sharp increase of ‘Machinery, Nec’ draws attention particularly due its expressive rise in the total 
value  added  of  the  economy,  i.e.,  10.1%  of  share  gain.  Recognised  as  knowledge  intensive  subsector  of 
manufacturing,  the  Structuralist-Schumpeterian  literature  has  stressed  the  growth-inducing  effects  of  the 
machinery subsector particularly regarding introduction and diffusion of technological change. Other sector 
that composed expressively to expand the high-tech group was ‘Transport Equipment’ that rose from 10.5% 
to 16.8%. Additionally, the increase of medium-tech subsectors, although in a lesser extent, also contributed 
for  the  productive  specialisation  (and  economic  dynamism)  varying  positively  in  3.4%.  In  short,  the 
South Korea's pattern of intra-sectoral specialisation was marked by a gradual share concentration in medium 
and high-tech sectors that together reached 86.1% of the total value added in 2008.  

 
In  Brazil,  the  pattern  of  productive  specialization  was  also  marked  by  the  expansion  of  high-tech 
subsectors  such  as  ‘Machinery,  Nec’,  ‘Electrical  and  Optical  Equipment’  and  ‘Transport  Equipment’. 

However, despite of the substantial increase of 9.6% in this group the pace and proportion of this expansion 
was clearly lower than in South Korea. Moreover, although the low-tech sector exposed a clear drop of 7.7%, 
the Brazilian economy remained dependent of less dynamic sectors such as ‘Food, Beverages and Tobacco’ 
in  which  represents  15.1%  of  the  total  value  added  in  the  economy.  Furthermore,  the  medium-tech  group 
presented a slight descendent trajectory varying from 26.5% in 1990 to 24.7% in 2008. In this group the most 
expressive  loss  was  in  ‘Rubber  and  Plastics’  that  dropped  2%.  In  brief,  Brazil  presents  a  manufacturing 
sector  more  diversified  than  South  Korea  but  in  less  dynamic  sectors.  In  a  comparative  perspective  of 
economic  development  this  dichotomy  stimulates  differently  processes  of  cumulative  causation  and, 
consequently, divergence in countries’ growth rates.

The inter and intra-sectoral composition of Brazil and South Korea culminated in distinct economic 
 
performances. In a comparative perspective it can also be illustrated with the global economy. Thus, figure 
3.4 shows the evolution of their shares in both global manufacturing and GDP elucidating the South Korean 
thriving  economic  dynamism  vis-à-vis  the  Brazilian  poor  performance.  Therefore,  over  the  decades  South 
Korea  exposed  a  sustained  economic  growth  taking  advantage  of  dynamic  economies  of  scale,  increasing 
returns and spill-over effects that set in motion processes of  cumulative causation. From 1950 to 1980, the 
share of South Korea in global GDP expanded 133.1% and manufacturing rose 210.7% (from 1970 to 1980). 
Even after the turbulent 1980s and the rise of neoliberal policies in the development world particularly in the 
1990s, the economy kept the impetus of growth  increasing its share in the global GDP and manufacturing. 
Brazil by contrast, although with a considerable increase of these variables from 1950 until 1980, collapsed 
with  the  outbreak  of  the  debt  crisis.  During  the  1980s,  Brazil  was  trapped  in  an  economic  dynamics  that 
sentenced  the  country  to  a  poor  economic  performance  in  subsequent  decades.  From  the  1990s  with  the 
advent  of  neoliberal  reforms  the  economy  not  only  remained  stagnated  in  the  evolution  of the  global  GDP 
share and but also lost a significant share in the global manufacturing.

2.  The structural decomposition analysis  

Seeking to understand the results found in the previous section, this section tries to find factors that 
 
led  the  path  of  structural  change  observed  in  Brazil  and  South  Korea  in  light  of  liberalising  policies 
implemented in these economies during the second half of 1990s. Therefore, based on the pioneer analysis 
developed by Leontief (1936 and 1941), the theoretical approach is based on the input-output method. Over 
the years this methodology has been widely used in structural analyses to study effects of distinct economic 
policies  over  the  structure  of  production.  Thus,  from  an  analytical  input-output  framework,  the  so-called 
structural  decomposition  analysis  (SDA)  inspired  by  Chenery  (1960),  Chenery  et  al.  (1962),  Chenery  & 
Syrquin (1980) and Chenery et al. (1986), has been applied for many countries in vast range of contexts and 
periods  to  identify  and  quantify  factors  that  contribute  to  a  given  change  in  the  sectoral  structure.  This 
method is usually adopted to investigate distinct factors, i.e. demand, trade and technological change, which 
contributed to a certain change in the industrial structure.   

 
Differently to the framework of neoclassical models, which consider economic growth as  a process 
limited by the supply side, the SDA is a method of growth account by the demand side. Furthermore, it takes 
account  inter-relationships  between  various  sectors  (and  subsectors)  of  the  economy,  rather  than  sectoral 
trends  in  isolation  from  one  another.  Using  this  methodology,  it  is  possible  to  empirically  investigate  the 
economic  role  of  a  productive  sector  without  restricting  the  analysis  to  its  “direct  effects”  on  the  economy 
regarding  generating  production,  employment,  value-added  products,  tax  revenue,  and  exports.  With  this 
method, it is possible to also investigate the “indirect effects”, i.e., the effects that a sector can exert on other 
sectors through channels established by input/output transactions between different economic sectors.  

 
Over  the  years  the  SDA  methodology  was  improved  as  analytical  tool  and  different  methods  were 
developed. In this sense, Feldman et al. (1987), Skolka (1989), Rose & Casler (1996) and Dietzenbacher & 

Los  (1998)  were  particularly  relevant.    Contemporaneously,  many  studies  analysed  the  economic  structure 
though  this  line  of  methods.  Kupfer  el  al.  (2003)  decomposed  the  output  and  employment  variation  of  the 
Brazilian economy between 1990 and 2001. Tregenna (2012) applied this method to South Africa from 2000 
to 2007. And Zakariah & Ahmad (1999) used the factor decomposition approach to Malaysia from 1978 to 
1987.  However,  none  employed  the  SDA  methodology  in  a  comparative  perspective  between  Brazil  and 
South Korea through a common database.  Therefore, the data available at the World Input-Output Database 
(WIOD)  were  used  to  analyse  the  output  decomposition  between  two  periods:    1995-2003  and  2003-2008. 
These  breakdowns  were  applied  more  due  data  availability  than  to  distinct  economic  policies.  In  addition, 
input-output  tables  were  estimated  in  constant  prices  using  the  database  available  in  both  current  and 
previous  years’  prices.  Therefore,  analogously  to  Chenery,  Robinson  and  Syrquin  (1986)  this  paper 

decomposed output growth (∆ܺ) in manufacturing into the following four components5: 

• 

•  Domestic  demand	(∆ܦ):  Refers  to  the  direct  and  indirect  effect  of  variations  in  the  domestic  final 

demand  throughout  the  economy  on  the  sector  (or  subsector)  output.  Domestic  demand  includes 
household  consumption  expenditure,  government  consumption  expenditure  and  gross  capital 
formation. 

•  Export	(∆ܧ):  Indicates  the  direct  and  indirect  variation  of  exports  on  each  sectoral  (or  subsector) 

output. It is important to note that this component is affected by intersectoral relationships. In other 
words,  it  is  affected  not  only  by  exports  of  the  sector  under  analysis,  but  also  by  exports  of  other 
sectors with which this sector is linked.   

Import substitution	(∆ܯ): Refers to the direct and indirect variation of sectoral  output associated to 

the substitution of imports (intermediates and final goods) for by domestic production. Analogously 
to  export  expansion,  this  component  is  affected  by  intersectoral  relationships  and  consequently 
reflects not only import substitution in a specific sector, but also import substitution in other sectors 
with which a sector is linked.  

•  Technological  change	(∆ܶ):    Indicates  the  variation  on  sector  (or  subsector)  output  associated  with 

changes  in  the  production  processes  which  affect  the  economy  coefficients  (input-output 
coefficients). Thus, this component is obtained through changes in the table of technical coefficients, 
which  shows  the  flow  of  intermediate  inputs  (domestically  and  imported)  into  the  production  of  all 
goods and services of the economy.  

 
Tables 3.2 and 3.3 show the results for both countries from 1995 to 2003 and 2003 to 2008. For each 
sector (or subsector) the contributions of the four components (domestic demand, export, import substitution 
and technological change) to economic growth are presented. Inter and intra-sectoral results are presented to 
provide subsidies to understand the process of specialisation in Brazil and South Korea. In order to maintain 
a robust intra-sectoral analysis, results of the SDA were presented as close as possible to the aggregation of 
the  last  section.  Thus,  manufacturing  was  aggregated  in  15  subsectors.  Additionally,  manufacturing  was 
divided by technology intensity (low, medium and high tech) according to UNIDO classification.  

3.  Interpreting results in light of distinct economic policies 

 
During the 1990s Brazil and Korea faced distinct economics polices. In Brazil, after a turbulent and 
critical passage through the 1980s marked by economic stagnation and high inflationary rates, the Real Plan 
(Plano Real) was adopted in 1994 aiming to stabilise the economy. The economic policy of the period was 
essentially  based  on  liberalising  reforms  that  south  through  high  interest  rates,  currency  overvaluation  and 
wage squeeze stabilise the economy. Measures such as trade liberalisation (reduction of tariff and non-tariff 
barriers),  privatisation  of  state-owned  enterprises  and  capital  account  openness  culminated  in  a  disastrous 
                                                            
5 Technical details about methodology are summarised in Appendix 3.1.   

economic  environment  for  the  national  industry.  Moreover,  from  1998  to  2003  the  Brazilian  economy 
experienced  a period of  balance-of-payment crisis and currency depreciation that associated to a  restrictive 
macroeconomic policy based on the inflation target regime undermined any attempt of significant recovery in 
the manufacturing sector.  

Therefore, as showed in Table 3.2, from 1995 to 2003 manufacturing output increased only 9.1% and 
 
exports pushed only 15.9% of this component. Additionally, it is important to note that during this period all 
components  of  the  Brazilian  manufacturing  sector  registered  negative  variations.  In  an  intra-sectoral 
perspective  results  of  the  structural  decomposition  analysis  revels  that  many  manufacturing  subsectors 
affected were those inserted in the medium and high-tech group. Remarkable examples are the subsectors of 
‘rubber  and  plastics’,  ‘non-metallic  mineral’  as  well  as  ‘electrical  and  optical  equipment’.  By  contrast  the 
primary  sector  output  based  on  the  Brazilian  comparative  advantage  grew  43.0%  mostly  driven  by  exports 
that  represented  26.0%  of  this  expansion.  Furthermore,  during  this  period  services  output  expanded  18.0% 
probably as a result of the privatisation process of the decade particularly in subsectors of infrastructure such 
as energy and telecommunications.   

In a distinct economic dynamism South Korea did not embarked in the same type of ‘fundamentalist’ 
 
economic reforms. As a matter of fact, although financial and trade liberalisation marked South Korea during 
the 1990s, it was much more pragmatic in order to continue and strength the existing ambitious strategy of 
industrialisation. Over de decades the South Korean history of economic development has been marked the 
special properties of manufacturing as a key sector to economic growth. Therefore economic reforms were 
implemented  as  pragmatic  mechanism  to  help  lift  specific  pressing  economic  and  financial  constraints  in 
order to expand the manufacturing sector. Even during de Asian crisis in 1997, despite of the re-articulation 
between  State  and  private  sector,  the  whole  of  the  State  was  central  to  keep  the  industrial  dynamism.  To 
overcome  the  crisis  there  was  a  reorganization  of  the  corporate  structure  with  processes  of  mergers  and 
acquisitions gaining momentum. Additionally, the South Korean State remained active either through long-
term  programmes  for  the  development  of  high-tech  sectors,  either  ensuring  important  long-term  funding 
sources through public banks. 

 
Therefore,  in  an  inter-sectoral  and  intra-sectoral  perspective  Table  3.2  highlights  the  dichotomy 
between  Brazil  and  South  Korea.  From  1995  to  2003  manufacturing  production  in  South  Korea  increased 
58.3%  wherein  50.7%  was  explained  by  exports.  Moreover  the  booming  expansion  of  medium/high-tech 
industries composed one of the main sources of economic dynamism. During the 1980s and 1990s, the South 
Korean  government  engendered  a  massive  effort  to  constitute  a  solid  strategy  based  in  technology 
development enhancing the industrial structure toward dynamic manufacturing industries. For example, the 
output  in  ‘chemicals  and  chemical  products’,  ‘rubber  and  plastics’,  ‘basic  metals  and  fabricated  metal’, 
‘machinery,  nec’,  ‘electrical  and  optical  equipment’,  and  ‘transport  equipment’  expanded  significantly 
mainly  pulled  by  exports.  In  numbers,  electrical  and  optical  equipment,  and  transport  equipment  increased 
the output production in 317.2% and 86.4% respectively where exports corresponded to 222.1% and 69.7%.  
Not by  coincidence, the  South Korean economic  growth has been higher  and much more sustainable when 
compared to the Brazilian economy.

From  2003  until  the  outbreak  of  the  global  financial  crisis  in  2008,  the  pattern  of  economic 
 
development  for  these  two  economies  exposed  interesting  movements.  According  to  Table  3.3,  in  South 
Korea  exports  of  the  manufacturing  sector  was  maintained  as  engine  of  economic  growth.  However,  the 
‘flying  geese’  movement  of  regional  productive  fragmentation  associated  to  the  economic  policy  based  on 
paradigm  of  global  value  chains  affected  negatively  the  component  of  import  substitution.  Although  the 
country  presented  a  higher  output  expansion  when  compared  to  the  Brazilian  economy,  the  productive 
reallocation of components and labour-intensive assembly-end part to other countries of the Asian block such 
as the 'third-tier' NICs (particularly China) slowed the pace of output growth during the period. As showed by 
Table  3.3,  although  the  output  growth  rose  39.1%  mainly  pushed  by  exports,  the  component  of  import 
substitution  affected  negatively  the  manufacturing  sector  in  8.6%.  In  an  intra-sectoral  view,  despite  the 
consolidation  of  medium/high  tech  manufacturing  subsectors  as  engine  of  economic  dynamism,  the  same 
industries  were  badly  affected  with  a  negative  variation  of  import  substitution.  In  this  aspect,  notable 
examples were ‘Coke, Refined Petroleum and Nuclear  Fuel’, ‘Chemicals and Chemical Products’, ‘Rubber 
and  Plastics’,  ‘Other  Non-Metallic  Mineral’,  ‘Basic  Metals  and  Fabricated  Metal’,  ‘Machinery,  Nec’,  and 
‘Transport  Equipment’.  In  short,  the  economic  dynamism  of  the  South  Korean  economy  was  not  higher 
because of deleterious effects of imports in the domestic production.     

 
In  Brazil,  inter  and  intra-sectoral  results  indicates  a  different  pattern  of  economic  growth  but  also 
some common trends. While South Korea the pattern of economic development was in both periods (before 
and after 2003) driven by  exports of manufacturing products, in  Brazil the domestic demand  from 2003 to 
2008 composed the key  variable of economic  growth.  In this period, the so-called commodity prices boom 
and the credit-led consumption-boom boosted the economy. The former affected the economy promoting the 
exports of primary products while the latter pushed the domestic demand as a whole. However, even in this 
context  once  again  manufacturing  performed  worse  when  compared  to  services  that  exposed  the  most 
dynamic  output  growth.  Not  even  the  Brazilian  National  Development  Bank  (BNDES)  providing  many 
benefits for national producers, such as funding with very low interest rates and certain benefits to stimulate 
exports (especially for producers that use domestic inputs) was capable to reverse this trend. In an extreme 
adverse macroeconomic policy marked by high and volatile interest and exchange rates the industrial policy 
became innocuous.  

 
Moreover, a comparative intra-sectoral analysis between Brazil and South Korea revels that low-tech 
manufacturing subsectors such as ‘leather, leather and footwear’ and ‘wood and products of wood and cork’ 
(in  the  case  of  Brazil)  exposed  a  negative  output  variation  while  ‘machinery,  mec’,  ‘electrical  and  optical 
equipment’  and  ‘transport  equipment’  expanded  significantly  in  both  economies.  Finally  another  common 

trend  between  Brazil  and  South  Korea  was  the  clear  negative  variation  of  import  substitution  in  the  total 
output. In both economies the demand has been attended by imports either means of production either inputs. 
Therefore seeking to evaluate this common trend in detail next the section turns to this issue.

4.  The density of industrial chains 

Data  regarding  import  input  coefficients  for  Brazil  and  South  constitutes  an  important  indicator  to 
 
analyse  the  density  of  domestic  industrial  chains.  Thus,  through  data  available  at  the  World  Input-Output 
Database (WIOD) and some input-output techniques is possible to measure the evolution of such confidents 
over time.  In this way, tables 3.4 and 3.5 elucidate that in each economy this coefficients followed a distinct 
trend  marked  by  contrasting  economic  policies  and  strategies  of  development6.  In  South  Korea,  over  the 
years the process of industrialisation was characterised by a constant expansion of manufacturing and gradual 
density increase of the domestic industrial chains. However, as showed by table 3.4, from 1995 to 2002 this 
process sketched movements related to an increasing share of imported inputs in the domestic manufacturing 
sector  that  were  consolidated  in  the  subsequent  period.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  from  2003  to  2008  the  South 
Korean economy significantly increased the share of imported inputs not only in the manufacturing sector but 
also  in  the  economy  as  a  whole.  The  reasons  for  that  are  twofold.  The  first  relates  to  the  new  productive 
environment  marked  by  the  global  value  chains  (GVC)  where  the  productive  structure  has  been  gradually 
fragmented  over  the  years.  In  this  view  productive  fragmentation  is  seen  as  an  important  source  of  firm 
efficiency through improvements in competitiveness both in domestic and international markets and by cost 

                                                            
6 Rocha (2011) analysed the participation of imported input coefficients only in the Brazilian industrial chains. Additionally, in this 
study the analysis adopted the IBGE database.  

 

savings.  The second reason relates to the ‘flying geese’ process of industrialisation, where the productivity 
capacity  at  a  certain  stage  of  the  economic  development  is  transferred  to  the  less  developed  country 
(particularly Nics-2 and China) in a process of regional fragmentation of the productive chain. Although both 
reasons are associated to the concept of productive fragmentation they might be seen as different sides of the 
same  coin.  It  is  because  the  fist  reason  is  related  to  cost  savings  per  se  and  a  premature  process  of  de-
industrialisation,  while  the  second  one  relates  to  a  regional  strategy  of  development  and  expansion  of 
manufacturing in the economy. Since South Korea expanded not only the presence of imported inputs in its 
productive structure but also the share of manufacturing, the second reason becomes more likely.

In the Brazilian economy, unlike South Korea, the manufacturing sector fell apart during the so-called 
lost decade in the 1980s. Moreover, the  restrictive neoliberal  economic policy  grounded in market friendly 
mechanisms  led  to  a  process  of  premature  de-industrialisation  without  an  end  in  sight.  In  this  dynamic, 
industrial restructuring involved mainly defensive adjustments in a context where investments were kept to a 
minimum  level.  Thus,  the  productive  fragmentation  seeking  cost  savings  was  widely  adopted  without  any 
long-term economic planning. Additionally, under a high and volatile interest and exchange rates, in periods 
of demand expansion (as during the 2000s) substitution of national inputs for imported ones constituted the 
easiest  way  to  attend  the  demand.  Analysing  the  import  input  coefficients  is  possible  to  realise  the 
dependence of the Brazilian domestic industry in relation to the international supply and the progressive loss 
of  density  in  its  industrial  chains.  It  associated  to  a  gradual  shift  to  free  market  policies  intensified  the 
presence of imported inputs the domestic industry. 

 
From 1995 to 1999 the ascendant trend of import input coefficients appeared blurred. However from 
this  period  onwards  these  coefficients  raised  almost  constantly.  Furthermore,  particularly  after  2002  this 
process  gained  speed  essentially  due  the  economic  recovery  (pushed  by  the  commodity  boom)  and  the 

structural  mismatch  between  the  structures  of  supply  and  demand.  The  most  representative  examples  of 
subsectors that exposed a substantial ascendant trajectory of imported inputs were ‘coke, refined petroleum 
and nuclear fuel’, ‘chemicals and chemical products’, ‘rubber and plastics’, ‘electrical and optical equipment’ 
and  ‘transport  equipment’.  Additionally,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  most  affected  manufacturing 
subsectors  were  those  inserted  in  the  medium/high-tech  group.  In  this  sense,  it  is  not  by  chance  that  the 
Brazilian economy has not structured the bases for a long-term economic growth. In fact, contemporaneously 
the only achievement of the Brazilian economic policy has been the establishment of successive short cycles 
of ‘stop and go’ arising from a decreasing share of manufacturing in the value added and the disarticulation 
of domestic industrial chains especially in medium/high-tech subsectors.

5.  Concluding remarks 

This  empirical  paper  sought  to  provide  a  comprehension  of  the  structural  transition  undertaken  by 
 
Brazil  and  South  Korea  in  a  comparative  perspective.  Therefore,  the  first  section,  through  the  Imbs  and 
Wacziargs’  methodology,  analysed  the  pattern  of  inter  and  intra-sectoral  diversification  exposed  by  these 
economies  before  and  after  the  1980s.  Firstly  the  data  showed  that  Brazil  was  affected  by  a  process  o 
premature specialisation in inter and intra-sectoral levels. Secondly the intra-sectoral data of manufacturing 
revealed that during the specialisation stage South Korea increased sharply the share of medium/high-sectors 
in  the  economy  while  Brazil  although  more  diversified,  remained  dependent  of  less  dynamic  sectors.  In  a 
comparative  perspective  of  economic  development  this  dichotomy  propelled  different  processes  of 
cumulative causation and, consequently, impacted the countries’ growth rates distinctly. Therefore, it is not 
by coincidence that the constant drop of the Brazilian share in the global manufacturing was followed by a 

regressive  evolution  in  the  global  GDP.  Consequently,  Brazil  remained  trapped  in  a  middle-income 
landscape translated in an unsustainable economic performance.  

 
In the second and third section, the analysis turned to the understanding of factors (demand, trade and 
technological change) that contributed to the formation of these productive structures in light of liberalising 
policies  implemented  during  the  second  half  of  1990s.  Thus,  from  1995  to  2003  during  the  height  of 
neoliberal reforms Brazil increased its manufacturing output in only 9.1%. In this period, with the exception 
of exports, all components registered negative variations. In a distinct economic dynamism, the South Korean 
manufacturing  production  increased  58.3%  wherein  50.7%  was  explained  by  exports.  Furthermore,  this 
expansion  was  composed  mainly  by  medium/high-tech  industries.  In  the  subsequent  period,  from  2003  to 
2008, South Korea maintained manufacturing as engine of economic growth but with an expressive increase 
of imports mainly due the ‘flying geese’ movement of regional productive fragmentation marked specially by 
the  rise  of  China  as  the world's  factory.  While  the  South  Korean  pattern  of  economic  development  was  in 
both  periods  (before  and  after  2003)  driven  by  exports  of  manufacturing  products,  in  Brazil  the  domestic 
demand from 2003 to 2008 composed the key variable of economic growth pushed mainly by the credit-led 
consumption  of  the  period.  In  this  dynamic,  the  so-called  commodity  prices  boom  also  played  a  central 
whole to boost the economy. However, even in this context once again manufacturing performed worse when 
compared to services that exposed the most dynamic output growth. 

 
In  the  fourth  section  was  measured  the  density  of  domestic  industrial  chains  through  import  input 
coefficients.  In  South  Korea,  from  1995  to  2002  this  process  sketched  movements  related  to  an  increasing 
share  of  imported  inputs  in  the  domestic  manufacturing  sector  that  were  consolidated  in  the  subsequent 
period. From 2003 to 2008 the South Korean economy significantly increased the share of imported inputs 
not  only  in  the  manufacturing  sector  but  also  in  the  economy  as  a  whole.  This  finding  is  consistent  to  the 
aforementioned ‘flying geese’ process of industrialisation where the productivity capacity at a certain stage 
of the economic development is transferred to the less developed country (in this case particularly China) in a 
process of regional fragmentation of the productive chain. By contrast, Brazil did not follow this pattern of 
economic development. As a matter of fact, the manufacturing sector fell apart during the 1980s and 1990s in 
a process of premature de-industrialisation without an end in sight.  In this productive disarticulation, many 
manufacturing  industries  kept  investments  to  a  minimum  level.  Furthermore,  the  productive  fragmentation 
seeking  cost  savings  per  se  was  widely  adopted  without  any  long-term  economic  planning.  Additionally, 
under a high and volatile interest and exchange rates, in periods of demand expansion (as during the 2000s) 
substitution of national inputs for imported ones constituted the easiest way to attend the demand. This fact 
not only revealed the dependence of the Brazilian domestic industry in relation to the international supply but 
also the absence of important intra-sectoral linkages.

Lowess Methodology and the U-shaped curve 

Analogously  to  the  procedure  adopted  in  Imbs  and  Wacziarg  (2003),  the  study  employs  a  non-parametric 
methodology based on locally robust weighted scatter plot smoothing (LOWESS)7. In this procedure, each 
estimate  x  is  a  function  of  the  xi’s  in  the  neighbourhood  to  be  estimated,  with  the  closest  observations 
receiving more weight than the more distant observations. The LOWESS smoother requires specification of a 
span, which is the percentage or total number of observations to be included in the estimated regression at 
observation  i.  In  this  study  the  span  adopted  is  0.60  which  means  that  40  of  total  observations  are  used  in 
each  local  regression.  Moreover,  the  LOWESS  uses  a  tricubic weighting  function  with  the  following 
formula:   

 

 

 

 

 

w୧ = ൬1 − ቚ୶ି୶౟

ୢ(୶)ቚଷ൰ଷ

 

 

 

(3.1) 

 
Where x is the smoothed response, xi are the nearest neighbours of x as defined by the span, and d(x) 
is the distance along the abscissa from x to the most distant predictor value within the span. In the present 
study, as well as in Imbs and Wacziarg (2003), the response variable y corresponds to a measure of sectoral 
specialisation, while the independent variable x is the GDP per capita of each country (in 2005 dollars). The 
observations of x and  y  are the annual values of  each indicator for the country under  consideration.  In this 
sense, the x values estimated by the nonparametric local regression will give form to a smoothed curve (U-
curved) that connects x to y and represents the relationship between specialization and GDP per capita. The 
measure of sectoral specialization employed is the Gini-Hirschman index (GHI) which is obtained by taking 
the  square  root  of  the  Hirschman-Herfindahl  Index  (HHI)  and  multiplying  it  by  a  100.  These  indexes  are 
defined as follows:

୶୨ቁଶ
HHI =	∑ ቀ୶౟ౠ

7 This method was first proposed by Cleveland (1979) and further developed by Cleveland and Devlin (1988). 

 
In these equations, xij is the value added of sector i and x is the total value added of the country j and 
n is the number of sectors. Therefore, the higher is the GHI, the more specialised is the economy.  The GHI is 
within a certain limit value. The maximum value of the index is 100 and in this case there is only one sector 
in the economy.  

Decomposition of output growth  

Analogously  to  the  method  used  in  Chenery  (1960,  1962),  the  so-called  Structural  Decomposition 

 
Analysis (SDA) is applied following Miller and Blair’s (2009) approach. The total output is defined as:  

ܺ = (ܫ −ܣௗ)ିଵ(ܦ +ܧ) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(3.4) 

Where, ܣௗ is the matrix of domestic inputs, ܦ is the domestic demand of national goods and ܧ is the exports. 
Considering the basic Leontief model for two periods ݐ and +ℎ , the vector of gross output (ݔ) can be written 

as follows:  

 

 

 

x୲ା୦ = L୲ା୦(D୲ା୦ +E୲ା୦)	and	x୲ = L୲(D୲ +E୲)	

 

 

(3.5) 

                                 

 

 

 

 

Where  the  matrix  ܮ(݊ݔ݊)  represents  the  Leontief  matrix  of  direct  and  indirect  production  coefficients 
defined as	ܮ = (ܫ − ܣௗ)ିଵ. Thus, the change in gross output between two periods ݐ and +ℎ , can be rewritten 

as: 

 

 

Δx = x୲ା୦ −x୲ = L୲ା୦(D୲ା୦ +E୲ା୦)−L୲(D୲ +E୲)			  

 

(3.6) 

 

 

Then through basic matrix algebraic manipulation, changes in ܮ and	D+ E, and consequently effects 

 

on	∆ݔ are represented as: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Δx = L୲ା୦(D୲ +E୲ +ΔD+ΔE)−൫L୲ା୦ −ΔL൯(D୲ +E୲)	   
Δx = (L୲ +ΔL)(D୲ା୦ +E୲ା୦)−L୲ା୦൫D୲ା୦ +E୲ା୦ −ΔD−ΔE൯   

 

 

 

(3.7) 

(3.8) 

 
Additionally  the  equations  are  summarised  according  to  the  average  approach.  As  argued  by 
Dietzenbacher and Los (1998) this method enhances the SDA methodology. Thus, summing   equations (3.7) 
and (3.8), and applying the average approach the following equation is obtained: 

 

 

Δx = ଵ

ଶ(ΔL)(D୲ +D୲ା୦ +E୲ +E୲ା୦)+ ଵ

ଶ(L୲ +L୲ା୦)(ΔD)+ ଵ

ଶ(L୲ +L୲ା୦)(ΔE)	    

(3.9) 

 

 

 

Where the first term indicates the effects of the change in the Leontief coefficients over the change in gross 
output, the second term refers to the effects of the change in domestic demand, and the third, exports. 

Assuming		ܣௗ = ܣ − ܣ௠,  where ܣ  is  the  matrix  of  total  inputs  and ܣ௠  is  the  matrix  of  imported  inputs, 

equation 3.9 can be re-written as: 

 

ଶ൫ܮ௧ +ܮ௧ା௛൯(߂ܦ)  + ଵ

߂ݔ =  ଵ
ܦ௧ା௛ +ܧ௧ +ܧ௧ା௛) 

 

ଶ൫ܮ௧ +ܮ௧ା௛൯(߂ܧ) + ଵ

ଶሾܮଵ(߂ܣ)ܮ௧ሿ൫ܦ௧ +

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(3.10)   

 

 

The  four  components  of  total  output  change  for  any  sector  or  subsector  over  the  period ℎ  are  thus 

 
calculated as follows: 

ଶ൫ܮ௧ +ܮ௧ା௛൯(߂ܦ +	߂ܧ) 

Domestic demand	(∆ܦ) = ଵ
Export	(∆ܧ) = ଵ
Import substitution	(∆ܯ) = ଵ
Technological change	(∆ܶ) = ଵ

ଶሾܮ௧ା௛(−߂ܣ௠)ܮ௧ሿ(ܦ௧ +ܦ௧ା௛ +ܧ௧ +ܧ௧ା௛)

The density of industrial chains 

 

Rocha  (2011)  through  the  input-output  framework  decomposed  import  coefficients  between  inputs 

and final goods. In this analysis, import input coefficients by sector are defined as ܫܫܥ and the total import 
input coefficient for the economy as	TIIC.  
Firstly define ܣ௠	(௡௫௡) as the matrix of direct import input coefficients: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ܣ௠ =	௓಺
௫  
where ݔ௡௫ଵis the vector of gross is output and ܼ௡௫௡ூ
is the matrix of intermediate consumption.  
Considering the Leontief matrix of direct and indirect production coefficients defined as	ܮ = (ܫ − ܣௗ)ିଵ and 
multiplying it by ܥூthe following equation is obtained: 

(3.11)
