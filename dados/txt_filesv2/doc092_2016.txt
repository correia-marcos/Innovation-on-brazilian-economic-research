Abstract

Did the threat of communism inﬂuence income distribution in developed capitalist
economies during the Cold War? This article addresses this question by regressing top
income shares of 18 OECD countries on the distance to events linked to the spread of
communism - revolutions and USSR invasions. We run a ﬁxed eﬀects panel for the 1950-
1990 period, controlling for institutional and economic conditions. This is an original
contribution to the recent literature on inequality, which stresses the importance of do-
mestic institutions and the two World Wars but fails to address the role of the Cold
War in redistributing income. We ﬁnd a robust and negative relationship between top
income shares and the distance to communist events. The results suggest that the spread
of communism redistributed income through a domestically conditioned mechanism: the
creation of common interest states.

Introduction

Inequality is one of the most important and controversial topics of our time. It has converted
into a central issue not only among socialists and anti-globalisers, but also the general public,
the media, politicians from diverse aﬃliations and academics. Many authors have diverted from
Lucas’ mainstream approach to inequality. According to (Stiglitz, 2014, p.6) “of the tendencies
that have marked modern macroeconomics, the most seductive and poisonous is the failure to
pay due attention to inequality”.

This renewed interest in the subject is related to the high levels inequality has recently
attained.1 Piketty (2014) shows that inequality has increased across the developed world, es-
pecially in Anglo-Saxon countries, since the 1980s, resuming to levels as high as those of the
early twentieth century. Several possible explanations arise in this context. Timmer et al.
(2014) explain the recent surge in inequality as a result of technological innovation and glob-
alisation. Piketty et al. (2014) argue that technology cannot explain diﬀerences in inequality
across continental Europe and Anglo-Saxon countries. Therefore, the authors explore the role
of institutions such as tax policy in explaining variations in inequality. Atkinson et al. (2011)
stress the role of the World Wars of the twentieth century in destroying massive stocks of
capital, both physical and ﬁnancial. In order to ﬁnance the wars and to repay the national
debts, post-war governments reached a consensus to increase tax rates, which played a role in
distributing income.

In spite of the importance of explaining the surge in inequality, it remains to be explained
the persistence of low levels of inequality in developed countries during the period that extends
from the post-war to the 1980s. This paper argues that this literature misses a relevant event
that marked the post-war period: the emergence of the communist block.2 The rise of the
Soviet Union as a world power after 1945 increased the threat of communist revolutions around
the world.

We argue that such context was favorable for the appearance of what Besley and Persson
(2013) call a common-interest state: a consensus among diﬀerent groups in a society that
enabled the state to increase ﬁscal capacity in order to protect its existence. For this consensus
to be reached, it was crucial that the ruling elites should have accepted to lose power. As
Przeworski (2009) and Conley and Temimi (2001) show, in the context of franchise extension,
this only happens when politically excluded groups impose a credible threat. Aidt and Jensen
(2014), in their study on the relation between revolutions and franchising in Europe between
1820 and 1938, observe that elites were more likely to expand franchising the closer the threat,
either domestically or abroad. This paper extends this argument to a context of democratic
countries and a credible external threat: the Cold War.

In order to test this hypothesis empirically, we constructed a variable that captures the
distance between the capital of OECD countries and the location of communist revolutions and
invasions carried out by the Soviet Union. The Cuban Revolution in 1959 and the Red Army
invasion of Prague in 1968 are famous examples of such events3. The variable is deﬁned as a
dummy for years with communist revolutions or USSR invasions weighted by the inverse of the
Euclidean distance between the capital of the country where the revolution/invasion happened
and the capitals of each OECD country.4 We use this variable to test, using a panel on OECD
countries, whether the threat of communist revolutions represented a force that lead to the

1This renewed interest is translated into several books recently published on the theme. See, e.g, Piketty

(2014), Atkinson (2015), Scheve and Stasavage (2016) and Milanovic (2016).

and prestigious book.

The article is organized in seven sections, including this introduction. Section II reviews
the related literature and develops our argument. Section III describes the data and discusses
evidence based on descriptive statistics. Section IV proposes an empirical model and Section
V presents the main results of the paper. Section VI runs robustness tests and Section VII
concludes the article.

2 Conceptual discussion and related literature

Inequality has been increasing in developed countries since the 1980s. This trend has at-
tracted a great deal of interest among academics as well as the greater public. Economists
have debated the causes of income concentration and identiﬁed a number of drivers of this
process. In their seminal article, Katz et al. (1999) stress the role of technology and labour
market globalisation in the rise of income concentration in rich countries. Globalisation nar-
rowed down the technological gap between developed and developing economies. It also reduced
trade barriers, which enabled relatively poor new industrial economies to access large consumer
markets abroad. This process shifted low-skilled labour industries to less developed countries.
As a consequence, the share of capital and high-skilled labour increased and the demand for
low-skilled labour fell in developed economies (Timmer et al., 2014).

In his ground-breaking study of inequality in developed countries, Piketty et al. (2014)
emphasize the role of institutional factors in explaining the diﬀerences in the evolution of
top income shares across western countries. The authors claim that tax policy reforms have
engendered behavioural changes among top earners. They introduce a richer model of pay
determination in which bargaining plays a decisive role. Wages do not simply reﬂect marginal
productivity in such framework. The model calculates three diﬀerent elasticities between tax
rates and wages. The ﬁrst one is the traditional eﬀort elasticity, according to which higher
marginal tax reduces the incentives for hardworking. The second elasticity is related to avoid-
ance eﬀorts. When marginal taxes are high, individuals have a greater incentive to search for
other forms of income sources, such as dividends and stock options. Finally, higher taxes make
top earner less likely to bargain for additional income.

Alvaredo et al. (2013) ﬁnd a strong and positive association between earned and capital
income. They infer that networking makes born-rich individuals more likely to get high paying
employment better paid. Moreover, top executives are more able to accumulate wealth.5 Roine
et al. (2009) conclude that ﬁnancial development and GDP growth signiﬁcantly increased top
incomes vis-a-vis other income levels.

Most of the literature focuses in the recent period, starting from 1980s. This is natural given
the speed at which inequality has been rising. Few authors address the following fact: western
societies became more unequal in the last three decades because income was remarkably well
distributed to start with. Piketty (2014) documents that top income shares fell during the
inter-war period and remained at record low levels in the post-war. The understudied question
of why inequality was so low then is as valid as the hot question of why it has been increasing
lately.

Only a few authors have recently studied the causes of the fall in inequality in the twenty
century. Piketty et al. (2014) presents the destruction of capital during the two world wars
and the rise in tax marginal rates in the post-war as the main explanations for the fall in top
income shares. Similar points appears in Atkinson et al. (2011), who also stresses the role the
equalization of earned income. Goldin and Margo (1992) refer to this process as ‘the Great
Compression’.

5There is a growing literature on social networks and inequality. See, e.g., DiMaggio and Garip (2011).

Omitted variable bias, however, may compromise these results, especially the marginal tax
eﬀects. It is possible that a common variable have reduced the political power of the elites,
leading to an increase in marginal taxes and to a fall in top income shares. Piketty et al. (2014)
are aware of this methodological problem. They propose a micro-approach by assessing how
CEO‘s behaved when taxes rose in a panel of countries. Nonetheless, the authors ﬁnd similar
results in their macro and micro-approaches.

This article addresses this omitted variable problem by assessing whether the Cold War
determined the fall in inequality. The most important military rivalry of the twenty century,
the Cold War conditioned the world order after 1945. Maier (2010) asserts that the potential
worldwide spread of communism played a decisive role in the conﬁguration of forces among
western countries.

Our hypothesis is the following: the more national elites were under the threat of communist
revolutions, more the state introduced policies that reduced top income shares. This hypothesis
derives from relevant social science and historical literatures.
It is striking, however, that
scholars from these ﬁelds have not studied the relationship between the Cold War and inequality
whatsoever.

Without appraising speciﬁcally the Cold War, social scientists make the case that military
conﬂicts and the risk of revolutions are likely to provide the state with the tools it needs to
promote income distribution. Persson and Besley (2009) and Besley and Persson (2010) show
that states raised taxes, predominantly income and wealth taxes, in periods of armed conﬂicts.
Scheve and Stasavage (2012) reach similar conclusion when studying inheritance taxes. Aghion
et al. (2012) ﬁnd that governments invest more in primary education in times of wars.

Przeworski (2009) and Conley and Temimi (2001) show that ruling elites only agree to
expand franchising when politically excluded groups impose a credible threat. Along the same
lines, Aidt and Jensen (2014) ﬁnd a positive relation between revolutions and franchising in
Europe between 1820 and 1938. The authors observe that the elites in each individual country
responded to civil unrest not only within their borders, but also in neighboring country. Elites
were more likely to expand franchising the closer the threat, either domestically or abroad.

This social science literature provides a useful insight for the study of Cold War and inequal-
ity. At ﬁrst the threat of revolutions pressured the elites to distribute power; once franchise
became universal, they had to distribute wealth. The earlier stage happened in Europe before
the Second World War. By the time the Cold War begun, the European elites had nothing but
their own wealth to share.

While social scientists relate wars to wealth distribution but miss the Cold War, historians
that study the Cold War miss its role in income distribution. The historical literature focuses
on international politics, which is natural given the nature of that conﬂict. The few pieces that
draw parallels between the Cold War and inequality do so incompletely or indirectly.

Kirshner (1998) asserts that western policymakers distributed wealth during the post-war
because inequality would have prevented the application of an “optimum foreign policy”. The
author argues that unequal economies grow less, compromising the capacity of states to spend
in defence and diplomacy. Besides downplaying the impact of inequality on domestic stability,
Kirshner (1998) does not test his argument empirically.

A number of studies have related the Cold War to issues indirectly linked to inequality in
the United States. However, this literature fails to reach a conclusion. Dudziak (2011) argues
that the threat of communism forced the American government to re-evaluate its approach to
civil rights. The laws that discriminated African-Americans fostered anti-Americanism around
the world, particularly among left-wingers, and compromised the country‘s role as the leader
of the “free world”. On the other hand, Schrecker (1998) states that the union laws launched
under Mccarthyism weakened labour movements, making unions more docile and less likely
to pressure for higher wages. Similar point appears in Brown (1997), according to whom

4

Mccarthyism explains why the private sector plays a greater role in healthcare, education and
social programmes in the USA than in Europe.

The historical literature on post-war Europe openly rejects any relation between the Cold
War and low inequality. Wegs (1991) claim that social classes stopped playing a signiﬁcant role
in Western Europe’s politics after the end of the Second World War. Similar point appears in
Whyte (1981) and Billiet (1996), according to whom religion was more important than classes
in European post-war elections. (Conway, 2004, p.68) argues that the Cold War was nothing
more than a “straightjacket” because inequality was virtually irrelevant.

Perhaps historians have found that issues related to classes were unimportant in post-war
Europe because European governments kept the gap between classes narrow to prevent the
threats of communism from disturbing the domestic status quo. By testing the role of the Cold
War in the fall in inequality this article provides an original contribution to that historical
literature. The article also contributes to social science literature that studies wars and state
capacity, and to the recent empirical literature on the dynamics of inequality.

3 Data description and descriptive statistics

This article tests the following hypothesis: national elites of developed countries redis-
tributed income in the post-war to avoid communist revolution in the context of the Cold War.
As an empirical strategy, we run a panel of 18 OECD countries, from 1950 to 1990 6. This
section describes the variables and sources used in this exercise.

The dependent variable is a measure of income inequality based on top income shares.7 We

use data on top income shares (1%, 5% and 10%) from the World Top Incomes Database 8.

We construct a variable that captures the distances between the capital of OECD countries
and the location of communist revolutions and invasions carried out by the Soviet Union. The
Cuban Revolution in 1959 and the Red Army invasion of Prague in 1968 are famous examples
of such events9. The variable is deﬁned as a dummy for years with communist revolutions or
USSR invasions weighted by the Euclidean distance between the capital of the country where
the revolution/invasion happened and the capitals of every OECD countries. That is:

CRit =

CRjt

distanceij

(1)

where CRjt is a dummy for the occurrence of the event communist revolution/USSR invasion
at country j in period t and distanceij is the geographical Euclidean distance between the
capitals of countries i and j. Thus, CRit captures two assumptions we test in with this exercise:
(i) the spread of communism during pos-war represented an external threat to Western elites;
(ii) this threat was unevenly distributed across Western countries.

In addition to this external threat, we also test whether domestic groups of interest have
pushed for communism. This is captured by two variables: (i)the share of communist parties in
Parliament; and (ii) the presence of left-wing parties in the executive. The former, communist
vote share is a measure of the electoral importance of communist parties in legislative elections.
It is calculated as the share of seats obtained by communist parties through each electoral cycle
between 1945 and 1990. The data was collected from each country‘s congress websites. Besides
legislative elections, a variable that considers government partisanship as proposed by Scheve

6A list of countries in the sample can be found on appendix.
7This article regress top income shares rather than Gini Index because it aims to test whether the threat
of communism fostered the emergence of the common-interest state, in which the elite had a smaller share of
national income.

and Stasavage (2009), has additional interest because it can capture the governments‘ ability
to implement redistributive policies. Following Scheve and Stasavage (2009), we use a dummy
variable Left Executive that equals one if the country had a president or prime minister from a
left-wing party.

Strong trade unions may also have pressured for income distribution. This appears in
Atkinson (2015), although the author has not provided robust evidence. We test for the role of
labour institutions with two variables. Firstly, we measure the density of trade unions from 1945
to 1990, whose source is Golden et al. (2014). Secondly, we capture diﬀerent wage bargaining
processes with a dummy that diﬀerentiates countries with centralized wage bargaining, involving
whole industries nationwide, from those where employers and employees of individual ﬁrms
negotiate directly (Scheve and Stasavage, 2009).

Besides the variables described above, we use covariates in order to control for other factors
that may have aﬀected top income shares. The empirical literature on state capacity emphasizes
the role wars in building state capacity. In order to test for this, we use the variable - War
Risk - as deﬁned by (Aghion et al., 2012, p.16): “war risk is a binary indicator set equal to
one if the country was engaged in an interstate war in the previous 10 years, according to the
variable ‘interstate war’ in the Correlates of War (COW) database”.

The model also controls for the role of democracy in determining inequality, an inﬂuential
point in the literature (Acemoglu et al., 2015). We deﬁne this variable as Polity IV score, as
in Marshall et al. (2011). Atkinson et al. (2011) draw attention to the eﬀects of global forces,
especially globalisation, in income distribution. We control for this by including the variable
TradeOpenness, deﬁned as the ratio between trade ﬂow and GDP (Roine et al., 2009).

The model includes the ratio between government expenditure and GDP to control for the
role of welfare state in income redistribution, as suggested by Atkinson (2015). This variable
also controls for a possible relation between the emergence of welfare state and the Cold War.
The data is from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.

We do not include income or income per capita among the independent variables to avoid
endogeneity. These are arguably correlated to state capacity Persson and Besley (2009). In
addition, we do not include top marginal tax rates, which is a common variable in the literature.
Acemoglu et al. (2015) argue that top marginal tax rates may lead to bad control problems,
as the increase in taxes, especially those linked to the top incomes, could be inﬂuenced by the
Cold War.

4 Empirical Strategy

This section details the empirical strategy of the article and interprets the results. We run
a ﬁxed-eﬀect model on a panel of 18 OECD countries covering the period from 1945 to 1990.
The data is in a ﬁve years average basis. The benchmark speciﬁcation is deﬁned by equation
(2):

ln(T opshare)it = β1 ∗ CRit + β2 ∗ Xit + λt + µi + εit

(2)

where ln(T opshare)it is the logarithm of the top percentile income share for each country i
at time t. The ﬁrst term in the right-hand side, CRit, is the measure deﬁned above that capture
the eﬀects of socialism as an external disciplining device to inequality in western countries. Xit
is a vector of control variables containing additional political and economic forces that may
explain top income inequality, λt is period-ﬁxed eﬀects, µi is the country ﬁxed-eﬀect and εit is
the model error term.

The model relies on the identiﬁcation strategy that β1 captures the eﬀects of the spread of
socialism on income inequality, controlling for other possible channels of political economy and
external inﬂuence and allowing for country and period ﬁxed eﬀects. As the countries in the
sample were not directly aﬀected by Soviet invasions or communist revolutions, there is rather
limited room for endogeneity problems.

Results from Table 2 point to a negative relationship between the occurrence of communist
revolutions and the share of top percentile between 1950 and 1990. The introduction of the
control variables do not reduce explanatory power of the variable CRit.

The coeﬃcient of union density has the expected signal: workers’ bargaining power, reﬂected
by union density, is associated with a reduction in income inequality, in line with the bargaining
game explanation proposed by Piketty et al. (2014). As for the variables that capture the threat
of communism, the ideology of the party in oﬃce does not seem to have an impact on top income
inequality. The share of communist parties in Parliament has a positive although less signiﬁcant
relationship with top inequality.

The control variable Polity IV conﬁrms that democracy did reduce inequality, in line with
Acemoglu et al. (2015). The coeﬃcient of the variable on labour institutions suggests that
countries where wage bargain is decentralised are more unequal. Although not strongly signif-
icant, the variable War Risk suggests that the escalation of the Cold War reduced inequality.
Cruacially, this variable barely aﬀect the main variable Communist Revolution. Trade openness
shows a strong and negative relationship between globalisation and inequality. This is at odds

with the conclusions in Timmer et al. (2014) for the post-1970s period. This suggests that
globalisation had a diﬀerent eﬀect in inequality depending on the period of analysis. Finally,
the coeﬃcient for government expenditures as a share of GDP is not signiﬁcant.

The results in Table 3 show a negative and robust relationship between top income inequal-
ity and the external threat of communism. The coeﬃcient remains robust when controlling for
additional variables that capture external conﬂicts, domestic political institutions, decentral-
ization in wage bargaining process and the size of government.

4.2 Mechanisms

This section tests the possible mechanism through which external events related to com-
munist revolutions may have aﬀected income distribution domestically. It analyses the eﬀects
of the interaction between our variable Communist Revolution and domestic features that may
have transmitted the threat of communism to the fall in inequality. Table 4 speciﬁes the results
of these mechanisms.

Notes: The analysis is based on a country-by-period panel data set covering the period 1950-1990. Sample
includes 13 OECD countries. Dependent variable is the ln of top income percentile share. All regressions
include period and country ﬁxed eﬀects. Control variables in the regressions above are the same from
estimation (5) of Table 3. Robust standard errors are clustered at the country level. Signiﬁcance: ***
p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Table 4 suggests that a few domestically-deﬁned variables transmitted the eﬀect of exter-
nal threats into domestic pressure for less inequality. The variables are: the level of labour
mobilisation, the strength of the communist parties, and the level of democratic institutions.

4.3 Robustness tests

Given such complex transmission mechanisms, communist revolutions may have had a
lagged eﬀect on inequality. Such lags may persist in spite of the ﬁve year averages in the
sample. We test for this eﬀect by lagging the variables analysed in tables 3 and 4. Table 5
reports the results of such robustness check.

The results in Table 5 are rather similar those in Tables 3 and 4. This is especially the
case when all variables are lagged. Hence, the eﬀect of communism on inequality had a lagged
eﬀect, but this does not change the basic conclusion of this article.

According to the literature on franchise extension (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000; Aidt and
Jensen, 2014), the Cold War contributed for income distribution because it reduced the power
of national elites. If that is so, the threat of communism must have aﬀected the very top income
more than the lower top income cohorts. In order to test for this hypothesis, we divide the top
income shares into three groups: top 10%, top 5% and top 0.1%. Table 6 shows the results
of this exercise. The sample of countries is restricted to those with disaggregated data on top
income shares.

The table shows a declining eﬀect of communist revolutions on top income shares. Although
all coeﬃcients are negative, only the coeﬃcients on top 0.1% and top 1% are signiﬁcant. This
result reinforces the conclusion that the Cold War had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on income distribution
because it reduced the elite’s income share.

5 Conclusion

This paper shows that the threat of communism was a disciplining device to inequality in
OECD countries during the Cold War. It contributed to the recent literature on top income
inequality in explaining the causes of inequality beyond the marginal productivity framework.
The literature stresses the role that domestic factors and, in few cases, the two World Wars
played in distributing income (Atkinson et al., 2011). We introduce contributions from the State
Capacity literature in this discussion by acknowledging that wars may reduce the power of the
elites, forcing them to distribute some of its wealth (Persson and Besley, 2009). Our results
suggests that the Cold War conditioned the creation of common-interest states, as Besley and
Persson (2011) deﬁned. A new form of social cohesion appeared under this post-war common
interest states, which conditioned the fall in top income shares. The spread of communist
revolutions created an external threat that redistributed income.
