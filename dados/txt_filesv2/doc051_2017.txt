Abstract  

This paper investigates the direct impact of monetary policy on variation to the relative 
prices and, in turn, the direct effect of the change in relative prices on the inflation rate 
considering the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC). Thus, we analyze the indirect 
impact of the change of Federal Funds Rate on the inflation rate through the change in 
relative prices. We use GMM with instrumental variables to estimate several systems of 
two equations for the U.S. economy based on quarterly time-series from 1975 to 2015. 
The empirical results show that a change of the Funds Rate has a direct effect on change 
in  relative  prices  and  that,  in  turn,  affects  indirectly  the  inflation  rate,  through  the 
change  in  relative  prices.  Hence,  change  in  the  relative  prices  affects  directly  the 
inflation rate via NKPC. In this context, variations of relative prices can be interpreted 
as  a  transmission  channel  of  monetary  policy.  Furthermore,  there  are  empirical 
evidences that the change of relative prices Granger-cause the inflation rate.

1. Introduction 

Economists  discuss  the  relationship  between  relative  prices  and  general  price 
level  for  decades.  This  issue  is  relevant  because  the  quantitative  theory  of  money 
(QTM) assumes that there is no relation between change in relative prices and change in 
general price level. It is a useful paradigm of economic theory because only real forces 
explain  the  relative  prices  and,  hence,  the  variations  in  relative  prices  are  not  related 
with the quantity of money.   

More precisely, the quantity theory of money states that changes in real variables 
such  as  real  GDP,  employment  and  technological  shocks  explain  only  changes  in 
relative  prices,  while  changes  in  the  money  supply  explain  only  absolute  price 
movements.  This postulate is known as dichotomy between relative prices and general 
price  level.  This  dichotomy  means  that,  other  things  equal,  such  as,  supply  of  money, 
velocity of money and level of output, changes induced by a real shock  on the relative 
prices  generate  compensatory  variations  in  other  relative  prices,  in  order  that  the 
absolute level of prices remain unchanged (Humphrey, 1997). 

One the one hand, it is difficult to defend the postulate of the dichotomy between 
absolute  prices  and  relative  prices,  because  the  net  effect  of changes  in  relative  prices 
across the economy on the index of general prices, stemming from a real shock, should 
be  null.  This  assumption  of  quantitative  theory  can  be  valid  in  the  long  run,  however 
there is stickiness of prices in the short run and, therefore, it is expected that the effects 
of  real  shocks  on  relative  prices  and,  consequently,  the  variability  of  relative  prices 
resulting  from  real  shocks  affects  the  absolute  level  of  prices.  On  the  other  hand,  it 
becomes  even  more  difficult  to  accept  that  monetary  shocks  do  not  affect  the  relative 
prices and, furthermore, if they affect, there is not effect of relative prices on the general 
price level considering an economy with stickiness of prices. 

Rigidities may occur due to pressure from trade unions, employment contracts, 
etc.,  but  also  due  to  the  nature  of  the  goods.  The  prices  of  tradable  goods  are  more 
volatile  than  the  non-tradable  goods.  The  price  of  services,  for  instance,  tends  to  be 
more  stable.  In  addition,  a  change  in  monetary  policy  does  not  affect  all the  prices  of 
goods and services at the same time nor in the same intensity. In another perspective, a 
change  in  monetary  policy  does  not  affect  all  the  prices  of  goods  and  services  at  the 
same time nor in the same intensity across the different sectors of the economy.   

In  this  sense,  it  is  reasonable  assume  that  the  monetary  policy  executed  via 
change in the money supply or via change in basic interest rate affects one of the most 
important  relative  prices,  i.e.,  the  real  wage.  For  example,  if  we  assume  that  nominal 
wage  is  rigid  in  the  short  run  and  the  prices  of  the  goods  and  services  rises  due  to  an 
expansionist  monetary  policy,  it  means  that  the  monetary  policy  affects  the  relative 
prices, because the workers' purchasing power decrease.  

Ohanian,  Stockman  and  Kilian  (1995)  show  that  monetary  shocks  affect  the 
relative prices, based on hybrid model of an economy with many industries that produce 
different goods, in which have flexible prices, as well as sticky prices. The authors show 
that  unexpected  changes  in  the  money  supply  change  the  relative  price  of  the  sticky-
price  good  in  terms  of  the  flexible-price  good,  so  the  real  effects  of  monetary 
disturbances  differ  across  sectors.  Moreover,  they  show  that  in  the  sticky-price  model 
with  demand-determined  output,  relative  prices  fluctuate  in  response  to  monetary  and 
real shocks. The authors also stand out that any variability on the relative prices in this 
model is entirely due to the existence of price stickiness. 

In this paper, we are interested in analyze at first, the effect of a demand shock 
on the relative prices, rather than the supply shock on relative prices. More specifically, 
we  are  interested  in  evaluate  the  effects  of  change  in  the  basic  nominal  interest  rate 
practiced  by  Federal  Reserve  on  variation  of  relative  prices.  However,  what  kind  of 
mechanism links the change in basic interest rate and relative prices in the same chain? 

This  link  can  be  explained  because  a  change  in  interest  rate  promoted  by  the 
Central Bank affects unequally the capital structure and the price of the different kind of 
markets. In this context, a variation in quantity of money in the economy generates the 
conditions to provoke changes in relative prices. Following this pattern, a change in the 
quantity of money can distort relative prices and, therefore, modify the signals emitted 
by prices. Here the return rates of the various combinations of capital are altered. This 
new  arrangement  of  relative  prices  will  be  distinct  from  those  generated  by  the 
fundamentals. In this sense, the new relative prices generate an increase in the profits of 
some companies at the expense of others firms (Hayek, 1933 and 1935).  

Many  studies  have  shown  that  the  change  in  relative  prices  can  improve  our 
understanding of the inflation rate. One of approaches regarding this thematic, evaluates 
whether  relative  prices  changes  can  help  to  clarify  the  Phillips  Curve  relationship 

between  inflation  and  output  or  not  (Vining  and  Elwertowski,  1976;  Fischer,  1981; 
Domberger, 1987; Ball and Mankiw, 1994 and 1995; Roberts, 1995; Aoki, 2001; Çatik, 
Martin  and  Onder,  2011).    Generally,  changes  in  relative  prices  are  used  as  proxy  of 
supply  shocks  in  Phillips  curve  equations,  in  order  to  model  the  short  run  output-
inflation trade-off. Based on empirical literature, changes in the relative prices, such as 
food  and  energy,  are  commonly  used  as  a  measure  related  to  shocks  of  supply,  which 
shift the Phillips curve in the short-run. In the presence of price stickiness, these shocks 
can  modify  aggregate  real  product,  as  well  as  the  general  price  level.  Nevertheless, 
relative  prices  can  be  affected  by  several  factors  other  rather  than  supply  shocks,  for 
example, elasticities of substitution between goods and demand shocks (Aoki, 2001).   

Parks and Cutler (1983) standout that in 1970’s and the beginning of 1980’s the 
economists  have  discussed  more  closely  the  connection  between  the  inflationary 
process  and  the  movements  in  relative  prices.  The  authors  point  out  that  there  was 
accumulated considerable evidence to show that the distribution of relative prices and of 
aggregate  price  level  are  interrelated.  However,  the  nature  of  the  connection  was  not 
fully  understood,  because  the  original  question  of  causation  is  the  following:  whether 
relative  prices  changes  cause  inflation  or  inflation  causes  relative  prices  to  change 
(Parks and Cutler, 1983).   

As  already  explained  the  quantitative  theory  does  not  admit  an interconnection 
between relative prices and general price level. However, what are the implications of a 
connection between aggregate and relative movements in prices?  Why is this question 
so  important?  Because,  whether  relative  prices  changes  cause  inflation  or  vice-versa, 
then either one of causal effect alone is sufficient to question the view that inflation is 
not  neutral.  Cukierman  (1983)  argues  that  exists  some  misunderstanding  about  this 
issue, because the economy  is fundamentally neutral to monetarily induced changes in 
the  price  level.  Nevertheless,  according  to  the  same  author,  because  of  temporary 
confusions  between  general  and  relative  movements  in  prices,  money  growth  is  non-
neutral in the short term. 

However,  what  kind  of  economic  interactions  show  links  among  change  on 
Federal  Funds  Rate,  changes  on  relative  prices  and  inflation  rate.  We  model  a 
relationship  between  changes  in  relative  prices  and  changes  in  the  basic  interest  rate 
based  on  the  quantity  theory  of  money.  Furthermore,  we  highlight  critically  the 
postulate  of  quantitative  theory  of  money  (QTM)  in  which  states  the  existence  of  a 
dichotomy between absolute prices and relative prices. After that, we discuss the effect 
of  monetary  policy  on  the  relative  prices  taking  into  account  the  stick  prices  and  the 
direct  link  between  the  relative  prices  and  general  price  level.  We  connect  the 
relationship  between  relative  prices  and  general  price  level  with  the  Phillips  curve 
literature.  Finally,  we  also  discuss  the  interdependence  between  change  in  relative 
prices and inflation rate and show Granger-causality tests for both variables.  

In this paper, we are interested to analyze at first, the effect of a demand shock 
(nominal  interest  rate  shock)  on  the  relative  prices,  rather  than  supply  shock,  or  more 
specifically, the effect of change in the basic nominal interest rate practiced by Federal 
Reserve  on  variation  of  relative  prices.  In  turn,  based  on  a  modified  Phillips  curve  in 
which  is  introduced  relative  prices  as  explanatory  variable,  we  evaluate  the  impact  of 
change  in  the  relative  prices  on  aggregated  inflation  rate.  This  paper  combines  three 
distinct literatures: the quantitative theory of money, the Phillips curve and the literature 
on the effects of changes in relative prices on the inflation rate.  

Using quarterly data from 1975:01 to 2015:02 for the U.S. economy, we perform 
an econometric analysis based on systems estimative of two regressions to evaluate the 
following  issues:  i)  the  direct  effect  of  the  variation  in  the  Federal  Funds  Rate  on  the 

changes  in  relative  prices;  ii)  the  direct  effect  of  the  change  in  relative  prices  on  the 
inflation rate considering Phillips curve; iii) the indirect impact of the change of Federal 
Funds  Rate  on  the inflation  rate  through the  variation  in  relative  prices; iv)  the  causal 
relationship between variations in relative prices and changes in absolute price level. 

           Our  database  allows  evaluating  distinct  relative  prices.  We  opt  for  combining 
pairs of several indexes price to represent the relative price variable, such as consumer 
price index, producer price index, house price index and implicit price deflator index.  

From  the  point  of  view  of  monetary  policy,  there  is  an  important  difference 
between the supply and demand shock effects on the relative prices and therefore on the 
inflation rate. On the one hand, in the case of supply shocks, they are exogenous shocks 
to the monetary policy formulator. For example, a shock in the price of oil can provoke 
disturbance  in  the  relative  prices  of  several  markets,  which  in  turn  can  affect  the 
inflation rate. 

On the other hand, a demand shock due to changes in the basic interest rate can 
significantly affect the relative prices, which in turn can affect the inflation rate. As the 
FED uses the basic interest rate to keep the inflation rate close to an inflation target, one 
should  take  into  account  that  changes  in  monetary  policy  can  also  significantly  affect 
the relative prices, which in turn can affect the inflation rate. In this context, changes in 
relative prices can be considered as transmission mechanisms of monetary policy. 

Besides  this  introduction,  we  present  in  the  section  2  the  theoretical  and 
empirical  aspects  in  which  show  firstly  an  economic  relationship  between  changes  in 
the  relative  prices  and  variations  in  the  nominal  interest  rate,  taking  into  account  the 
quantitative  theory  of  money  (QTM).  Secondly,  we  discuss  one  of  the  QTM’s 
postulates known as dichotomy between relative prices and absolute prices, in which it 
refers  to  the  effects  of  real  and  nominal shocks  on  relative  prices  and  on  the  absolute 
level  of  prices  respectively,  considering  price  stickiness.  We  introduce  a  New 
Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) adjusted with the introduction of a change in relative 
prices.  Finally,  we  show  the  database  and  the  econometric  approach.  In  the  section  3, 
we display the empirical results and in the section 4, we discuss the final remarks.  
2. Theoretical and empirical aspects  

The  quantitative  theory  of  money  proposes  a  positive  relationship  between 
variations in the money supply and variations in price of goods and services in the long-
term  context.  The  QTM  asserts  that  increasing  the  quantity  of  money  in  the  economy 
will  eventually  generate  to  a  proportional  percentage  rise  in  the  prices  of  goods  and 
services. The equation of quantitative theory is  

                                                           (1) 
where Ms represents the money supply, V represents the velocity of money, P represents 
the average price level and Y represents the real output.  Since our interest is to discuss 
the effect of monetary policy on relative prices, it is required a new price index P’ such 
as P’ ≠ P. Hence, we can modify the equation (1) in the follow way: 

                                                               (2) 

In addition, after some algebraic transformation we have 

where k = 1/V.   Now we show the demand function for money represented as 

                                                                    (3) 

PYVMsYPPVPMs''YPPkPMs''                                                                      (4) 

where  > 0 and  

 < 0 represent the parameters associated to real income (Y) and 

nominal interest rate ( R ) respectively. In this context, we can make 

 to 

obtain a relation between relative price and nominal interest rate 

                                                                   (5) 

where  
 If we take the logarithm of both sides in the equation (5) and, after 
that, we also apply a total differentiation, we found the equivalence between change in 
relative price and change in nominal interest rate such as  

                                                              (6) 

we can test empirically the equation (6) as follow 

                          (7) 

Since  that  the  equation  (7)  shows  an  stochastic  relation  between  change  in 
nominal  interest  rate  and  change  in  relative  prices,  i.e.,  shows  the  impact  of  monetary 
policy on change in relative prices, it becomes necessary has a link between change  in 
relative prices and change in absolute  price level, in which can be found in a modified 
Phillips curve.  

Despite have originally been proposed for more than half a century, the negative 
correlation between inflation and unemployment shown in the Phillips curve; remains at 
the center of the current macroeconomic debate. The importance of this relationship can 
be  proven  by  the  fact  that  studies  of  the  Phillips  curve  are  common  in  most  central 
banks  around  the  world,  especially  those  that  adopt  the  regime  of  inflation  targeting 
(Hargreaves et alii, 2006). In addition, Annable (2007) states that the Phillips curve is 
among the most important relationships studied by macroeconomics. 

An extensive literature on the inflation dynamics is based on the New Keynesian 
Phillips  curve,  i.e.,  a  fixing  pricing  model  with  nominal  rigidities  that  implies  that 
inflation can be explained by the expected evolution of the real marginal cost (Cogley 
and Sbordone, 2006). Empirically there is a large econometric debate on the relevance 
of  the  New  keynesian  Phillips  curve.  The  studies  of  Galí  and  Gertler  (1999)  and  Galí 
and Lopez-Salido (2001) present statistical results favorable to the NKPC, we also have 
studies  suggesting  that  the  empirical  relevance  of  the  Phillips  curve  should  be 
considered weak (Rudd and Whelan, 2005; Lindé, 2005; and Bardsen et al,2004). 

We  estimate  an  open  economy  New  Keynesian  Phillips  Curve  (NKPC)  to 
characterize  the  inflation  dynamic  of  the  U.S.  economy  based  initially  on  “hybrid” 
model of the Phillips Curve, proposed by Gali and Gertler (1999), so that 

                                         (8) 

  captures  the  relative  weight  on  the  forward-looking  price  setting, 

where 
is  the 
discount rate and mc is the proportional deviation of marginal cost from its steady-state 
value.  We  introduce  change  in  the  relative  prices  and  the  pass-through  effect  in  the 
equation (8) such as  

     (9) 

where we assume that output gap can be used as a proxy to marginal cost (Çatik, Martin 
represents change in the real exchange rate 
and Onder, 2011). Moreover,

According  to  Sims  (1999,  2001)  a  forward-looking  specification  has  an 
equivalent backward looking model. In this line, we assume that expected inflation rate

and 

 

In this context, we can analyze three cases. When 

= 0, one obtains the original 
Phillips  curve,  whether  we  do  not  consider  the  exchange  rate  and  the  relative  prices. 
There  is  only  a  simple  relation  between  inflation  rate  and  output  gap  –  proxy  for 
unemployment  rate.  When 
  is  positive,  the  inflation  rate  depends  not  only  on  the 
output  gap,  but  also  on  lagged  inflation  rate,  of  real  exchange  rate  changes  and  of 
relative prices. Finally, if 
= 1, the output gap, the real exchange rate changes and the 
variation of relative prices affect not the inflation rate, but the variation of inflation rate. 
In  sum,  in  this  section,  we  introduce  a  model  to  evaluate  if  change  in  the 
nominal interest rate really produces effects on change in relative prices and, thereafter, 
if these changes in relative prices influence on the inflation rate. For that, we estimate a 
system of two simultaneous regressions via GMM. The first regression shows the effect 
on variation of relative prices due to variation in the nominal interest rate (Funds_rate), 
and the second one displays the effect on inflation rate due to change in relative prices. 
The first equation is estimated as 

 

 

 

 

(11) 

where Δ (Pi/Pj) identifies the change in relative prices and Δ (Funds_rate) is the change 
in  the  nominal  interest  rate,  specifically  change  in  the  effective  Federal  Funds  Rate.  
The federal funds rate (R) can be understood as the interest rate in which the depository 
institutions  trade  overnight,  or  from  a  day  to  other  one,  federal  funds  with  each  other. 
The  federal  funds  rate  is  the  basic  interest  rate  in  the  American  financial  market.  The 
parameter 
 in the autoregressive components captures the inertia in the dynamics of 

the dependent variable and 

is the error term.  

The second equation of the system is a NKPC adjusted with the introduction of a 

change in relative prices specified as 

Equation 12 estimates the impact of our variable of interest on the inflation rate, 
  is 

i.e.,  the  effect  of  changes  in  the  relative  prices  on  the  rate  of  inflation,  where 

defined as the change in consumer price index. This equation take into account as well,

.  The  inflation  rate  also  responds  to  change  in the 

real exchange rate, as well as  it responds to the output gap. Thus, we have systems of 
simultaneous equations to estimate and evaluate.  

We  investigate  the  indirect effect  of  the change  in  the  nominal  interest  rate  on 
, in which it is the result of 

the inflation rate through the relative price by the term

the product of their respective estimated coefficients. We also assume that 

 

The system composed by equations (11) and (12) is subject to some sources of 
endogeneity. The Federal Reserve (FED) has adopted the Taylor rule since 1980s1 and 
we  use  time  series  since  1975.  Then,  it  is  possible  that  exist  some  sources  of 
endogeneity,  because  in  the  1970s  possibly  the  variable  of  the  FED  control  was  the 
money  supply  (exogenous  variable)  and  consequently  the  federal  funds  rate  was  an 
endogenous variable.   

Equations  (11)  and  (12)  define  a  simultaneous  equations  model.  Because  can 
exist  endogeneity  problem,  we  use  GMM  (Generalized  method  of  moments)  with  IV 
(instrumental variables). In this context, the instruments must be "good instruments" to 
be  relevant  and  valid  for  the  appropriate  use  of  the  IV  method.  It  means  that  the 
instruments  must  be  not  only  correlate  with  endogenous  regressors,  but  also  has  to  be 
orthogonal  to  the  disturbance.  In  this  sense,  we  use  some  statistical  tests  for  our 
econometric specification: the test of underidentification (Cragg and Donald, 1993), the 
test of overidentifying Sargan-Hansen, in which it is  also known as J-statistic, and the 
Stock-Yogo  test  (Stock  and  Yogo,  2005)  to  analyze  the  hypothesis  of  instruments 
weakness. 

We stand out that specific problems arise in conventional inference regarding to 
OLS  regressions  when  the  variables  are  not  stationary.  In  this  sense,  Johnston  and 
DiNardo  (1997)  highlight  the  relevance  of  knowing  whether  similar  issues  happen  in 
the  two-stage  approach,  least  squares  regressions.  Hsiao  (1997a,  1997b)  analyzes  this 
problem and concludes that the inference with two-stage least squares estimators using 
IV stays effectual, even in the case in that time series are considered non-stationary or 
non-co-integrated.  In  that  context,  the  conclusions  of  Hsiao  are  valid  when  GMM  is 
applied.    

 
We  use  the  procedure  of  Newey  and  West  (1987a,  1987b)  for  all  estimated 
models  to  solve  the two  problems  of  the  serial correlation arising  of  the  residuals  and 
unknown heteroscedasticity. They have suggested a more general covariance estimator, 
which is consistent in the presence of both  heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of an 
unknown form. 

   
In  order  to  analyze  the  causal  relation  between  changes  in  relative  prices  and 
change  in  absolute  price,  it  is  used  the  methodology  of  Granger  (Hamilton,  1994).  To 
carry out the Granger causality test, it is necessary, at first, to verify the stationarity tests

significance of the coefficients. In this case, if Ho is not accepted, we conclude that the 
estimated coefficients are statistically different from zero and a given variable causes, in 
the Granger sense, another one.

We use proxies to relative prices  (Pi/Pj) based on combination of several index 
prices  such  as  Consumer  Price  Index  (CPI),  Producer  Price  Index  (PPI),  House  Price 
Index  (HPI),  Implicit  Price  Deflator  (GDPDEF),  in  which  results  in  the  following 
relative  prices:  CPI/GDPDEF,  PPI/GDPDEF,  HPI/GDPDEF,  CPI/PPI,  HPI/CPI, 
HPI/PPI. Moreover, we use the Effective Federal Funds Rate (Funds_rate) to represent 
the variable of monetary policy.   

 
The  specification  of  Phillip  curve  (equation  12)  uses  the  change  of  CPI  as 
dependent variable (cpi_rate) and the lag of inflation rate [cpi_rate(-1)], change in real 
exchange  rate  (d_exch_rate),  output  gap  and  change  in  relative  prices  (d_Pi/Pj)  as 
independents variables. The variables RGDP and (Pi/Pj) are transformed in logarithmic. 
Hence,  d_Pi/Pj  =  Log[Pi/Pj)t  /  (Pi/Pj)t-1]  and  output  gap  =  Log(RGDP)t  –  HPtrend,  where 
HPtrend  is  obtained  via  HP  filter  (Hodrick-Prescott  Filter).  The  others  variables  is 
defined as: cpi_rate = log(cpit/cpit-1) and  d_exch_rate = (exch_ratet - exch_ratet-1). 

The next section shows the econometric results of the estimated models defined 
by  equations  (11)  and  (12)  based  on  generalized  method  of  moments  (GMM).  We 
analyze four systems of equations for each pair of tables. Each system is composed by 
two equations. In this sense, we have 3 pairs of tables: tables 2 and 3, tables 4 and 5 and 
tables 6 and 7.  For example, the first system is composed by the models 1A (table 2 – 
Equation  11)  and  1B  (tables  3  –  Equation  12).  The  forth  system  is  composed  by  the 
models  4A  (table  2  –  Equation  11)  and  4B  (tables  3  –  Equation  12).  Hence,  one  can 
evaluate the indirect effect of the change in the federal funds rate on the rate of inflation 
through the relative price. 

3. Econometric results 

This  section  shows  empirical  evidences  on  the  connection  among  monetary 
policy, relative prices and inflation rate at subsection 3.1 and presents Granger-causality 
tests between change in relative prices and change in absolute price level at subsection 
3.2.   

3.1 Monetary policy, relative prices and inflation rate 

Table  2  displays  the  regressions  according  to  equation  11,  i.e.,  the  models  1A, 
2A, 3A and 4A. The empirical results presented show that for any of these models, all 
variables are statistically significant at the 1% level, except the constant terms of models 
3A and 4A. The J-statistics present p-values higher than 0.12 and, thus, these results do 
not provide evidence to reject the hypothesis of overidentification. Therefore, the model 
specification is not rejected. 

At the end of Table 2, the F statistic shows empirical evidences for the rejection 
of  the  null  hypothesis  of  weak  instruments.  The  value  of  Cragg-Donald  F-statistic  is 
40.24375  and  the  Stock-Yogo  critical  values  at the  5% level  of  significance  are  20.23 
for  the  models  1A  and  2A.  The  models  3A  and  4A  also  present  values  of  F-statistic 
(29.53132) higher than critical values at the 5% level (20.84). 

The effects of the percentage change in the federal funds rate on the percentage 
change in the relative prices are positive for all models in Table 2. In this context, there 
is  an  empirical  evidence  that  changes  in  relative  prices  are  explained  by  changes  in 
nominal interest rate. In other words, monetary policy affects changes in relative prices, 
specifically the change in Consumer Price Index/  Implicit Price Deflator and Producer 
Price Index/Implicit Price Deflator.

Table  3  displays  the  estimates  results  of  the  Models  1B,  2B,  3B  and  4B 
according  to  equation  (12).  The  results  presented  by  Models  1B  to  4B  revel  that  all 
estimated  coefficients  are  significant  at  5%  level,  except  the  coefficient  of  output  gap 
relative to model 2B. As expected, the estimated coefficients of output gap and change 
in real exchange rate present positive signs.   

The first system is exhibited by Model 1A in Table 2 and by model 1B in Table 
3.  Model  1B  demonstrates  the  direct  effect  of  the  percentage  change  in  the  relative 
prices  on  the  inflation  rate,  on  which  the  estimated  coefficient  value  is  0.865427. 
However, the indirect effect demonstrates that variations in the federal funds rate affect 
relative prices (Model 1A), which thereafter affect the rate of inflation (Model 1B). This 
means that a quarterly increase of 1% in d_funds_rate will affect positively Δ(Pi/Pj) (%) 
by  0.001067%.  Given  that  a  1%  increase  in  Pi/Pj  (%)  increases  inflation  rate  (  π  )  by 
0.865427%, the final effect of a 1% increase in d_funds_rate (%) will cause a quarterly 
increases in π in 0.000923%, i.e., 0.001067*0.865427. Notice that if the relative prices 
were defined as (Pj / Pi), opposite to (Pi / Pj), the estimated coefficients of the change in 
relative prices will display opposite signs to those found in Tables 2 and 3. 

The  second  system  is  composed  by  Model  2A  in  Table  2  and  by  model  2B  in 
Table 3. Model 2B shows the direct effect of the percentage change in the relative prices 
on the inflation rate, in which the value of the estimated coefficient is 1.014896. Hence, 
the  indirect  effect  shows  that  variations  in  the  federal  funds  rate  affect  relative  prices 
(Model  2A),  which  in  turn  affect  the  rate  of  inflation  (Model  2B).  This  means  that  a 
quarterly  increase  of  1%  in  d_funds_rate  will  positively  affect  Δ(Pi/Pj)  (%)  by 
0.001068%. Given that a 1% increase in Pi/Pj (d_cpi_gdpdef) increases inflation rate by 
1.014896%, the final effect of a 1% increase in d_funds_rate (%) will cause a quarterly 
increase in π in 0.001084%. 

In the same vein, the third system is represented by Model 3A in Table 2 and by 
model  3B  in  Table  3.  The  empirical  results  show  that  a  quarterly  increase  of  1%  in 
d_funds_rate  will  positively  affect  Δ(Pi/Pj)  (%)  by  0.006319%  based  on  Model  3A. 
Given  that  a  1%  increase  in  Pi/Pj  (%)  increases  inflation  rate  (d_ppi_gdpdef)  by 
0.100262%, the final effect of a 1% increase in d_funds_rate (%) will cause a quarterly 
increase in π in 0.000633%. In the same line, the fourth system is composed by Model 
4A in Table 2 and by model 4B in Table 3. A quarterly increase of 1% in d_funds_rate 
will positively affect Δ(Pi/Pj) (%) by 0.006685%, according to Model 4A. Given that a 
1%  increase  in  Pi/Pj  (d_ppi_gdpdef)  increases  inflation  rate  by  0.104621%,  the  final 
effect  of  a  1%  increase  in  d_funds_rate  (%)  will  cause  a  quarterly  increases  in  π  in 
0.000699%.

Table 4 displays the regressions according to equation 1, i.e., the models 1C, 2C, 
3C and 4C. The  empirical evidences  show that all variables are statistically significant 
at  the  5%  level  for  any  of  these  models.  The  J-statistics  do  not  provide  evidence  to 
reject the hypothesis of overidentification, take into account a p-values higher than 0.14. 
In this way, the model specification is not rejected. 

There  is  empirical  evidence  for  the  rejection  of  the  null  hypothesis  of  weak 
instruments, based on F statistic, as displayed in Table 4. The value of Cragg-Donald F-
statistic is 77.65620 and the Stock-Yogo critical values at the 5% level of significance is 
20.23 for models 1C and 2C. The models 3C and 4C also present values of  F-statistic 
(29.53132) higher than critical values at the 5% level (20.84). 

The effects of the percentage change in the federal funds rate on the percentage 
change in the relative prices are negative for all models in Table 4. In this context, there 
is empirical evidence that monetary policy affects changes in relative prices, specifically 
the  changes  in  Consumer  Price  Index/Producer  Price  Index  and  House  Price  Index 
/Implicit Price Deflator.

Table  5  shows  the  estimates  of  the  Models  1D,  2D,  3D  and  4D  according  to 
equation  (2).  The  results  shown  by  Models  1D  to  4D  indicate  that  all  estimated 
coefficients are significant at 5% level. 

The  first  system  is  represented  by  Model  1D  in  Table  5  and  by  model  1E  in 
Table 6. The indirect effect shows that variations in the federal funds rate affect relative 
prices (Model 1D), which in turn affect the rate of inflation (Model 1E). This means that 
a  quarterly  increase  of  1%  in  d_funds_rate  will  negatively  affect  d_cpi_ppi  (%)  by  -
0.002633%. Given that a 1% increase in d_cpi_ppi (%) reduces inflation rate (cpi_rate) 
by  -0.033912%,  the  final  effect  of  a  1%  increase  in  d_funds_rate  (%)  will  cause  a 
quarterly increases in π in 0.000089%.  

The  indirect effect  of  the  variations in  the  federal  funds  rate  on  relative  prices, 
which in turn affect the rate of inflation for the second (Models 2C, 2D) , third (Models 
3C,  3D)  and  fourth  (Models  4C,  4D)  systems  are  -0.002696*-0.056674=0.00015,  -

Table  6  displays  the  regressions  according  to  equation  11,  i.e.,  the  models  1E, 
2E,  3E  and  4E.  The  results  show  that  for  any  of  these  models  all  variables  are 
statistically significant at the 1% level, except the constant term of model 1E which the 
estimated coefficient is not statistically significant at 10% level. The J-statistics, based 

on  p-values  higher  than  0.30,  do  not  provide  evidence  to  reject  the  hypothesis  of 
overidenfication. Hence, the model specification is not rejected. 

The F statistic indicates evidence for the rejection of the null hypothesis of weak 
instruments,  as  shown  in  Table  6.  The  value  of  Cragg-Donald  F-statistic  is   22.32817 
and the Stock-Yogo critical values at the 5% level of significance is  20.86 for models 
1E and 2E. The models 3E and 4E also present values of F-statistic (50.92116) higher 
than critical values at the 5% level (20.86). 

The effects of the percentage change in the federal funds rate on the percentage 
change in the relative prices are negative for all models in Table 6. In this context, there 
is empirical evidence that monetary policy affects changes in relative prices, specifically 
the  changes  in  House  Price  Index/Consumer  Price  Index  and  House  Price  Index/ 
Producer Price Index.

In  sum,  the  empirical  results  show  that  the  monetary  policy  affect  changes  in 
relative prices. Moreover, changes in relative prices, resulting from changes in federal 
funds  rate,  are  transmission  mechanisms  of  monetary  policy  because  they  indirectly 
affect the inflation rate.  

Besides,  all  the  estimated  coefficients  regarding  to  Phillips  curve  estimations, 
according equation (12), present the coefficient
, i.e., the coefficient of the lagged 
inflation rate é lower one unit.  It means that, in the considerate period, there is a trade-
off between output gap and inflation rate, rather than between output gap and variation 
of inflation rate.   The lagged values of the inflation rate represent an inertial effect of 
past  inflation  on  current  inflation.  Nevertheless,  such  lagged  values  also  reflect  some 
price  rigidity  in  the  economy.  The  idea  of  inflationary  inertia  is  well  aligned  with  the 
idea of nominal rigidity in the new Keynesian approach. 

A relevant result, which is not highlighted in the literature, refers to the lagged 
variables  associated  with  changes  in  relative  prices.  Tables  2,  4  and  6  show  that  the 
estimated  coefficients  of  these  variables  are  statistically  significant  and  show  some 
degree of "relative prices rigidity". 

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  relative  prices  associated  with  the  house  price 
index,  such  as  d_hpi_gdpdef  (table  4)  and  d_hpi_cpi  (table  6),  show  the  highest 
estimated  coefficients  among  all  relative  price  changes  lagged,  around  0,67.  When 
comparing  this  value  of  0.67  with  the  estimated  coefficient  highest  of  the  lagged 
inflation rate, we find a similar value around 0.66 in table 5. This means that the rigidity 
of the inflation rate, which is the variation of the absolute price level, is as high as the 
rigidity  of  the  change  in  relative  prices.  These  results  are  intriguing.  Which  explains 
rigidities  in  relative  price  changes?  Why  are  they  so  high?  What  are  the  economic 
implications of such rigidities? Why the house index price stands out among the others 
ones. 

The  real  estate  price  index  evaluates  prices  of  goods  that  can  be  considered 
durable  consumer,  as  well  as  capital  goods.  Perhaps,  this  peculiar  nature  of  this  good 

11may partly explain the inertial effect of their relative prices. In this context, the viscosity 
of the relative prices of the real estate market in relation to the average prices of other 
goods  can  become  larger.  The  aforementioned  aspects  may  somehow  to  explain  the 
effects of the housing bubble of the American economy, known as subprime crisis. This 
is  not  the  purpose  of  this  article,  but  perhaps  these  considerations  may  inspire  future 
research. 

3.2 The interdependence between relative prices and the general price level  

The tables show Granger's causality tests among the changes relative prices and 
the inflation rate (CPI). Considering that all the variables are stationary, as shown in the 
appendix, the optimal number of lags can be obtained based on the SC, HQ,  LR,  FPE 
and AIC criteria via VAR models. 

The  table  8  shows  the  pairwise  Granger  causality  tests  between  the  variables 
D_CPI_GDPDEF  and  CPI_RATE.  The  empirical  results  show  a  causality  for  both 
variables,  i.e.,  D_CPI_GDPDEF  Granger-cause  CPI_RATE  and  CPI_RATE  also 
Granger-cause D_CPI_GDPDEF. The results are valid for the different lags combined 
with  their  respective  criteria.  Of  course, it  is  expected  a  mutual  Granger-causality  (bi-
causality) between the change of CPI index and the change of the ratio CPI index / GDP 
deflator, because CPI is part of both indicators.   

However,  the  empirical  results  of  Granger  causality  tests  between  CPI_RATE 
and changes of the other relative prices are different. Tables 9 to 13 show that change of 
relative  prices  Granger-cause  the  change  of  absolute  price  for  all  kind  of  criteria 
associated with their respective lags.

Taking into account the empirical results, it is possible analyze the implications 
of these results. In terms of economic policy, the results suggest that if the policymaker 
imposes variability of the basic interest rate used by the  FED to conduct the monetary 
policy, it is expected some variability in relative prices and, consequently, variability of 
inflation rate as well. It means that the policymaker should not make abrupt changes in 
monetary  policy  to  avoid  undesirable  and  unpredictable  fluctuations  on  the  inflation 
rate.  

4. Final remarks 

Based  on  quarterly  database  of  the  U.S.  economy  for  the  period  1975:01  to 
2015:02, the empirical results show that variations in the federal funds rate have effect 
on change of relative prices, which in turn indirectly affect the inflation rate  via change 
of  the  same  relative  prices.  In  sum,  the monetary  policy  directly  affects  the change  of 
relative prices and, in turn, the changes of relative prices directly affect the inflation rate 
via NKPC. Hence, the monetary policy indirectly affects the inflation rate via change of 
relative  prices.    Besides,  we  found  empirical  evidences  in  which  change  in  relative 
prices Granger-cause change in inflation rate measured by CPI rate. 

In this context, exist a relevant implication that must be considered regarding to 
monetary policy transmission mechanisms, which occurs through the changes in relative 
prices.  There  may  be  more  difficulty  for  policymakers  predict  the  outcome  of  the 

monetary policy on relative prices and, hence, on variables of interest, such as inflation 
rate. Therefore, we find empirical evidences in which the change of relative  prices can 
be considered a transmission channel of monetary policy. 

Besides,  all  the  estimations  Phillips  curve  show  the  coefficient  of  the  lagged 
inflation rate lower than one unit does.  It means that, in the considerate period, there is 
a  trade-off  between  output  gap  and  inflation  rate  rather  than  between  output  gap  and 
variation of inflation rate.   

A relevant result, which is not highlighted in the literature, refers to the lagged 
variables associated with changes in relative prices, i.e., refer to inertial effects. These 
results  show  some  degree  of  "relative  prices  rigidity".  Based  on  the  empirical  results, 
one  can  inquire  which  explains  rigidities  in  relative  price  changes.  What  are  the 
economic  implications  of  these  rigidities?  These  issues  can  be  investigated  in  further 
researches.
