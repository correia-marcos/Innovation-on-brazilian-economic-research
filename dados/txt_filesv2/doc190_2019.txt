Abstract

This study provides evidence of how commodities price shocks aﬀect local economic activity
in Colombia. As identiﬁcation strategy, we exploit the interaction between international coﬀee
prices that aﬀect the local economic growth diﬀerentially across municipalities that have a diﬀerent
intensity in coﬀee production. Using satellite images of light density at night as a proxy of local
economic activity, we document a positive and strong eﬀect of coﬀee price shock on local economic
outcome. We also examine some potential channels by which this association may have played
out. We document that more illuminated areas report better schooling outcomes and a reduction
in mortality. Our ﬁndings help to understand the economic dynamic in an accurate way at a
sub-national level in Colombia, where data about GDP at municipality level are not available.

1 Introduction

Many studies have investigated the eﬀects of commodity price shocks on the economic activity at the
national level in both developed and developing countries (see e.g., Chen and Nordhaus, 2011; Michaels,
2011; Acemoglu et al., 2013; Caselli and Michaels, 2013, among others). Although the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) is a traditional indicator used to analyze these eﬀects, the researchers usually have to
deal with some inconsistent and bias that could arise in their estimated results. This is due to the
fact that GDP itself is often inadequately measured, mainly in developing countries (Henderson et al.,
2012). In contrast, few papers have analyzed whether these eﬀects vary at a more disaggregated level.
The diﬃculty in this type of analysis is related to the unavailability of data at the subnational level,
oﬃcial authorities in developing countries often do not have the infrastructure and resources to generate
accurate statistical data on GDP.

This paper studies these questions by examining the eﬀects of shock in coﬀee prices on the local
economic growth in Colombia measured as intensity of night-lights1. We do this by exploiting the
variation in international coﬀee prices, which enable us to assess how the changes in the economic
environment aﬀected the Colombian municipalities’ economic growth among 1992-2005. In particular,
we focus the period between the years 1994-1997, in which internal coﬀee prices increased sharply as a
consequence of a frost episode in Brazil.

The use of luminosity data as a proxy of economic activity has been documented and tested in the
pioneering work by Henderson et al. (2012). We could expect that most human activities in the evening,
represented as more consumption and more production, required more artiﬁcial lights. This could be
understood because the majority of goods used at night need lights. Therefore, we could assume that
regions with more light intensity are regions with more economic activity (Elvidge et al., 1997; Doll
et al., 2006; Chen and Nordhaus, 2011). Consequently, we would expect that its income to be higher
(Henderson et al., 2012; Lessmann and Seidel, 2017).
In this order of ideas, it seems reasonable to
assume that night-lights can be used as a proxy of GDP for regions where data are poorly measured
or data are not available. To shed a light on this hypothesis, we provide consistent evidence on the
relationship in our empirical application at the subnational level in Colombia2.

The use of luminosity data is attractive for several reasons. First, this data could help to deal with
potential problems of no availability or little reliability that plague oﬃcial data in developing countries
(Henderson et al., 2012; Chen and Nordhaus, 2011; Sutton et al., 2007). Colombia is an example of this
lack of information and data on GDP at municipality level does not exist3. Second, luminosity data
are available over time and for all places on Earth with uniform measure and over the very ﬁne level of

1Other measures of economic activity have been used as proxies of GDP such as electricity consumption. However,
electricity consumption often are not available for many countries at sub-national level. In the case of Colombia, electricity
consumption information are not available over time and at the municipality level

2For a ﬁrst view of the validity of this hypothesis, Figures A1 and A2 in the appendix show a plot of log GDP and

log lights for the country as a whole and at the department level. We can observed a strong and positive relationship.

3To the best of our knowledge, the most disaggregate data on GDP that at available in Colombia is at the department

level. Department are analogous to states in the United State.

resolution. Finally, even though potential problems concerning measurement errors can appear, related
to how the satellite captures the lights, or climatic conditions, or human culture in the use of lights, this
kind of measurement errors are not correlated with traditional GDP data errors (Pinkovskiy and Sala-i
Martin, 2016).

Our identiﬁcation strategy compares the night-lights intensity of producing and non-producing mu-
nicipalities before and after coﬀee price shocks in a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence approach. This analysis is
important in the sense that it can suggest to the governments to encourage (or to discourage) the agri-
cultural sector in speciﬁc municipalities. We ﬁnd diﬀerential and statistically signiﬁcant increases in the
night-lights intensity in municipalities that produce more coﬀee when the price rises exogenously. In
particular, the estimated coeﬃcient from our preferred speciﬁcation reports an elasticity in coﬀee price
shocks of 0.20, which represent an increase of 0.26 percent relative to the baseline mean. We also show
that our results are robust with respect to a diﬀerent speciﬁcation. In particular, we conﬁrm that the
results are robust with respect to control for municipality and year ﬁxed eﬀects, municipality-speciﬁc
linear time trends, diﬀerent cluster speciﬁcations as well as to control by a set of socio-economic char-
acteristic of municipalities. Furthermore, we obtain similar results when we used diﬀerent night lights
density measures.

Having documented that the coﬀee price shock have a strong and robust eﬀect on nighttime lights,
we then present suggestive evidence for some potential mechanisms through which the coﬀee price shock
may be have aﬀect the nighttime density. We focus on two factors that have been traditionally linked by
the literature with to local economic conditions: schooling and mortality rates. First, we use the 2005
Colombian Demographic Census to construct the average of years of education by municipalities for the
population with 25 or more years old and then we estimate the link between light nigh intensity and
years of education. The estimates suggest that in areas with greater luminosity reﬂect higher years of
education. Consistent with our results, there is some evidence showing that geographic units (counties,
states, countries) with better economic condition reﬂect as more school resources have a positive eﬀect
on years of education (see e.g., Case and Deaton, 1999; Duﬂo, 2001; Paxson and Schady, 2002; Card
and Krueger, 1996)

Second, using data about vital statistic from the Colombian National Administrative Department of
Statistics (DANE), we construct the mortality rate of each municipality. Then, we estimate our preferred
speciﬁcation using mortality rate as dependent variable. A reduction of the mortality variable could be
interpreting as an increase in survival chances, which could be reﬂect better economic conditions in that
speciﬁc area. We show that an increase of 1 percent in our coﬀee shock variable is associated with and
decrease in the mortality rate.

This paper is related to a large literature that uses satellite images as a proxy of economic activity
(see e.g., Pinkovskiy and Sala-i Martin, 2016; Alesina et al., 2016; Michalopoulos and Papaioannou,
2013; Henderson et al., 2012, among others). For example, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013) use
luminosity data to investigate the role of deeply rooted pre-colonial ethnic institutions over regional
development in Africa. Alesina et al. (2016), in its turn, construct measures from luminosity data in

2

order to investigate the consequences and origins of ethnic inequality. Speciﬁcally, they ﬁnd evidence of
those geographic endowments between ethnic countries that could explain inequality. Pinkovskiy and
Sala-i Martin (2016) use nighttime lights as tools in order to show how much weight is necessary to
give to national accounts GDP per capita and household surveys to obtain a better predictor of income.
They ﬁnd that the best predictor of the log of true income must receive nearly 100% of the weight on
GDP per capita.

Our work is also related to the voluminous literature that assesses the eﬀects of macroeconomic
shocks on several local economic variables (see e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2013; Monteiro and Ferraz, 2010;
Vizcaino, 2017; Carreri and Dube, 2017, among others). Acemoglu et al. (2013), for example, using
oil price shocks as an instrument for income, assess the changes in health spending in the southern
United States. Vizcaino (2017), using a similar empirical strategy, documents that a gold boom has
a positive and statistically signiﬁcant impact on birth outcomes in Colombian children. Monteiro and
Ferraz (2010), in its turn, analyzing how the increase in Brazil’s oil production aﬀect local democracy
ﬁnd that royalty payments produce a large incumbency in the short-term.

Most closely related to our study are the contributions of Dube and Vargas (2013), Miller and
Urdinola (2010) and, Santos (2018). Dube and Vargas (2013), for example, show how the commodities
price shocks have an eﬀect on armed conﬂict in Colombia. More speciﬁcally, the authors document
that changes in the price of agricultural goods are negatively related to violence, while changes in the
price of natural resources are positive. Meanwhile, Miller and Urdinola (2010), exploiting world coﬀee
price ﬂuctuations in order to examine the cyclical nature of infant and child mortality in Colombia,
ﬁnd a procyclical relationship in child death. Finally, Santos (2018) analyzing the gold boom found a
decrease in local unemployment by 3.5% in the short term in Colombia. To the best of our knowledge, the
present study is the ﬁrst to exploit a quasi-experimental design to empirically investigate the relationship
between coﬀee price shocks and a more accurate measure of local economic growth (night-lights density)
in Colombia. As a product of this analysis, our ﬁndings also contribute with a new estimation of
economic growth for Colombia at the municipality level.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 brieﬂy reviews the Colombian coﬀee market.
Section 3 describes the data and how our variables were constructed. Section 4 presents the empirical
strategy. Section 5 provides the main results and robustness tests. Finally, section 6 concludes.

2 Background

Colombia is well known for being one of the largest coﬀee producers in the world. During the largest
part of the century XX, the Colombian economy is being associated with coﬀee production, which has
played an important role in the development and economic growth of the nation (C´ardenas et al., 1997).
Most coﬀee production in Colombia is concentrated in the mountainous region, at the departments
of Antioquia, Caldas, Quindio, and Risaralda. The altitude in this region ranging from 1000 to 2100
meters, and the average temperature varying between 18 and 22 degrees Celsius. Rainfall is frequent
with measure approximately of 1500 to 2000 millimeters. In some regions, according to its geographic

3

characteristics, coﬀee can be produced during all year in two harvests. The main harvest is carried out
between October and December, and the second between April and May. We will take advantages of
this environment conditions in our empirical strategy.

Colombian coﬀee sector is known to be, over the period of our analysis (1992-2005), the most im-
portant agricultural sector. There are several reasons that could understand this importance. First,
coﬀee has been the second largest export commodity during the decades of the 90s. Its participation
in the total GDP and the agricultural GDP are about 1.7 and 23.9 percent between 1995 and 1999,
respectively (Giovannucci et al., 2002). Second, Colombian coﬀee cultivation employs the largest num-
ber of workers than in other agricultural sectors. Speciﬁcally, at the beginning of the 90s, the coﬀee
sector represented near to 34 percent of the agricultural employment, which could be translated in a
750 thousand full-time jobs (Junguito and Pizano, 1991). Finally, incomes of about 18 percent of rural
households depend directly on coﬀee production in 1997 (Giovannucci et al., 2002). This dependence
is associated either with the beneﬁts for crops or wages labor. Given the importance of this sector,
the favorable environment condition that is necessary for coﬀee cultivating and the high quality and
availability of data, the study of the coﬀee market becomes very attractive.

3 Empirical strategy

The empirical strategy follows a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence estimator and seeks to examine whether changes
in international coﬀee prices have a diﬀerent impact in areas that are more suitable to produce more
coﬀee on local economic growth measured as the night-lights intensity. Thus, with the objective of
obtaining the causal eﬀects, we could compare the intensity of the light in producing and non-producing
municipalities before and after the shock of prices. In particular, our variable of interest is the interaction
between the log of average annual of international coﬀee prices and the intensity of coﬀee production
in each municipality in 1997. Thus, we can interpret this variable as our measure of exposition to the
price variation or macroeconomic shocks.

Two potential endogeneity problems could threaten the validity of our empirical strategy. On one
hand, we could face coﬀee price endogeneity due to Colombia rank as the second exporter during a large
part of our time of study and this could have an inﬂuence on international coﬀee prices (Dube and Vargas,
2013). Following Dube and Vargas (2013), we address this concern using data on the export volume of
Brazil, Indonesia, and Vietnam, the other three major coﬀee producers, as an instrument for the internal
coﬀee price. On the other hand, coﬀee production could be endogenously determined because we do
not have a measure of the production of this commodity at the beginning of our period of studies. To
deal with this issue, we follow the strategy proposed by Dube and Vargas (2013), and instrumentalize
coﬀee intensity with rainfall and temperature for each municipality4. Rainfall and temperature could
be excellent candidates for instruments due to the fact that geographic conditions of each municipality
determine which are more suited to produce coﬀee5.

4See Miller and Urdinola (2010) for a similar approach.
5See section 2 for details about these conditions. Temperature and rainfall data come from Dube and Vargas (2013).

Formally, we can carry out the estimation in two stages. The second stage can be speciﬁed as:

lmdt = αm + ρd + λt + µm × t + β(Cof f eemd × logP Cof f eeavt) + ΦZmdt + εmdt

(1)

where lmdt is the log of the sum of luminosity intensity in the municipality m, department d, and year
t; Cof f eemd represents a measure of land destined to coﬀee production in 1997 for each municipality;
logP Cof f eeavt represents the annual average of the natural log of the international coﬀee prices. The
vector Z including time-varying controls, like the natural log of population, that are included in some
our speciﬁcations. The model also include municipality ﬁxed eﬀects (αm) and department ﬁxed eﬀects
(ρd), which absorb any unobservable time-invariant factors between municipalities and department such
as geographic characteristics that could confounder de coeﬃcient. We also include year ﬁxed eﬀects (λt),
which captures aggregate shocks impacting the entire country but that can change over time. The term
εmdt, in its turn, is the idiosyncratic error term. Finally, we also control for speciﬁc-municipality linear
tends µm × t to take into account possible factors changing over time that might aﬀect the outcome of
interest.

The ﬁrst stage for coﬀee, in its turn, can be represented as:

Cof f eemd × logP Cof f eeavt = αm + ρd + λt + µm × t +

jr × T n

jr × F Et)θhn + ΦZmdt + ξmdt (2)

(Rm

h=0

n=0

jr is the average annual rainfall of municipality m of department d raised to the power h; T n

where Rm
jr is
the average annual temperature of municipality m of department d raised to the power n; θhn = 0; F Et
is the log coﬀee export volume of Vietnam, Brazil, and Indonesia; all exogenous variables considered in
the second stages are included in this stage also. Our main estimation uses 2SLS and all our models use
robust standard errors for clustering at the department level to control for potential serial correlation
(Bertrand et al., 2004).

The parameter of interest is

in the equation (1), which show us the diﬀerential impact of coﬀee
price shock on the economic growth in municipalities that cultivate more coﬀee. The key identifying
assumption of our approach is that in the absence of coﬀee price shocks, municipalities with diﬀerent
coﬀee production have experienced the same proportional changes in light-nights intensity. We also
exploit the fact that this commodity is not uniformity distributed all over the country.
In fact, its
distribution depends on demographic characteristics (temperature and rainfall) as we have mentioned
before. Therefore, we can assume that any eﬀects of coﬀee price shocks are randomly assigned. Thus,
any changes in the proxy of the intensity of coﬀee cultivation are not correlated with our measurement
of economic activity, once we have controlled for all independent variables.

4 Data

4.1

International Coﬀee Prices

This paper constructs a time series data on the international coﬀee prices form the International Coﬀee
Organization. The data correspond to the period of 1992 until 2005. The focus of our study is between
1994 to 1997, the period in which the coﬀee price increased exogenously as a consequence of a frost
episode in Brazil that produced a substantial harvest loss6. Figure 1 shows the time series of average
annual of international coﬀee prices7. We can visualize the three peak that we mentioned before.
Speciﬁcally, focus on our period of study, coﬀee prices rose dramatically of $1.53 per kilogram in 1993
to a high of $4.17 per kilogram.

[Figure 1 approximately here]

4.2 The intensity of Coﬀee Production

The National Federation of Coﬀee Growers (NFCG) had developed three censuses since its creation in
19278, at the beginning of the 70s, at the beginning of 80s, and the last one at the middle of 90s. For the
purpose of this study, the measure of the intensity of coﬀee production is the number of hectares planted
with coﬀee in each municipality in 1997, the most recent data available. We obtained this information
from Dube and Vargas (2013). The ﬁnal sample contains information about 966 municipalities, which
correspond to 86% of total Colombia’ municipalities. Figures 2 and 3 draw the geographical distribution
of coﬀee production and the distribution of coﬀee intensity production at the municipality level in 1997,
respectively. Note that although the coﬀee cultivation is concentrated on departments of Antioquia,
Caldas, Quindio, and Risaralda, there is a signiﬁcant dispersion among the municipalities, which show
us that importance of coﬀee production varies substantially across the municipalities. More speciﬁcally,
549 municipalities producing coﬀee that is approximately 57% of our sample. Given this heterogeneity,
municipalities are exposed to diﬀerent changes in their economic activity. These changes will play a
very important role in our empirical application.

[Figure 2 approximately here]

[Figure 3 approximately here]

6There are other episodes of exogenous changes in the international supply of coﬀee that could be exploited like frosts
and drought in Brazilian’s coﬀee harvest during 1975 and 1985, respectively; or the collapse of the International Coﬀee
Agreement during 1989-90 (See Figure 1 for a graphic illustration). Nonetheless, the date on the intensity of night-lights,
our independent variable, is only available since 1992 until 2013.

7Figure A2 in the appendix shows the tendency of internal coﬀee price for Colombia since 1990 to 2005. Again, we

can observe that between 1994 and 1997 prices increased sharply.

4.3 Nighttime light

We use luminosity intensity as our main variable of economic activity across Colombian municipal-
ities. Data came from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System
(DMSP/OLS) provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) since the
1970s. We use data from 1992 to 2005 due to its digital availability9. Each satellite observes each place
on Earth every night between 8:30 to 10:00 pm local time. The data are collected and saved in a digital
number (DN), which ranged from 0 to 63 with a resolution of 30 arc-second area pixel, or approximately
0,86 square kilometers at the equator10. The dataset covering 75N to 65S latitude and 180W to 180 lon-
gitude. The data are processed overlaying all daily images obtained during the calendar year, removing
ephemeral lights like lightning and forest ﬁres, those light that are shrouded by cloud or overpowered
by the aurora or solar glare (near the poles), and other factors that can confound the results. Figure 4
illustrates graphically how the night-lights intensity evolved over Colombia in 1992 and 2005. We can
observe that the intensity of the lights increased signiﬁcantly in many municipalities already illuminated
as well as in some municipalities unlit in 1992. In general, the sum of the night-lights intensity rose in
mean by 4.09% during this period.

We use a raster calculator tool to construct our proxy of GDP. Speciﬁcally, we sum up all the digital

numbers across pixels for each Colombian municipalities for each year11.

lightmdt =

×(# of pixels in municipality m, department d, and year t with DN = i)

(3)

i=0

This measure of night-lights intensity has been frequently used to construct indexes over countries
and year in this kind of literature. Following Henderson et al. (2012), we take the natural log of this
sum in order to construct our main dependent variable.

[Figure 4 approximately here]

4.4 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

As we have mentioned before, the disaggregated national account in developing countries is unavailable or
available with poor quality. In Colombia case, GDP data only are available at national and department
level. We use data on GDP at the national level from the World Bank from 1992 to 2005. Meanwhile,
department GDP data come from Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad´ıstica (DANE for its
acronym in Spanish), which there are available only since 2000.

9Six sensors have collected this time series of DMSP/OLS nighttime lights for the period of 1992-2013: F10 (1992-1994);

F12 (1994-1999); F14 (1997-2003); F15 (2000-2007); F16 (2004-2009), and F18 (2010-2013).

10Note that the luminosity intensity ranking between 0 and 63, where a value of 0 mean no light and 63 the largest

luminosity.

11Other measures are calculated like mean, median and, standard deviation of night-lights density. We use these
measures in auxiliary regression as robust tests. In this article, we present this estimation on standard deviation, others
estimations are available on request.

4.5 Census Data

In our analyses we use a set of municipality’s characteristic in order to provide robustness to the results.
This data from the 1986, 1993 and 2005 Colombian census, which are available through the Integrated
Public Use Micro Sample (IPUMS)12. The IPUMS data provide demographic and socioeconomic infor-
mation about 10 percent of individuals randomly extract to the original census. The information are
weighted in order to preserve the representativeness. For our purpose, we construct the average weighted
of years of schooling, which we use as dependent variable in our mechanism section. In this exercise, We
limit the sample to individuals over 25 years old, which probably their schooling decisions have already
ﬁnished. On the other hand, we construct the data about the number of household with electricity and
water supply and we include as a control variable in our main results.

5 Results

5.1 A ﬁrst overview of the data.

Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics for producing and non-producing municipalities separately.
One feature of potential interest are the values in the row that summarize the changes in light density at
night between treatment and control group before and after macroeconomic shock. In general, we can
observe that on both non-coﬀee and coﬀee producer municipalities the night-lights intensity increased.
On average, the sum of the light intensity of non-producer municipalities passed from 940.60 to 983.90,
while coﬀee producer municipalities passed from 551.82 to 562.33, which represented an increase of 4.6%
and 1.90%, respectively.

5.2 Relationship between Night-lights and GDP

[Table 1 approximately here]

Henderson et al. (2012) and Pinkovskiy and Sala-i Martin (2016) have documented the strong correlation
between night-lights and GDP at the national level for a high set of countries. However, this relationship
exists speciﬁcally for Colombia? Are the night-lights a good proxy for GDP a geographic disaggregated
level? In this subsection, we investigated these questions and we brought statistical support to the
strong relationship plotted in Figures A1 and A2. Speciﬁcally, using OLS estimator, we regressed the
log of night-lights intensity on log GDP at the department level. The result is presented in Table 2.
Our most basic speciﬁcation is presented in column (1), we do not include any controls. In the next
speciﬁcations, we add controls to the baseline speciﬁcation. Thus, column (2) add year ﬁxed eﬀects,
column (3) department ﬁxed eﬀects and, column (4) department speciﬁc linear time trends.

In overall, the coeﬃcients in columns (1) to (4) suggest a positive and statistically signiﬁcant linear
relationship between log night-lights and log GDP. In addition, we can see that the estimated relationship
remains very similar in its magnitude across diﬀerent speciﬁcation, although its signiﬁcance falls from
1 percent in column (1) to 10 percent in the remains. Column (4) provides the elasticity of night-lights

with respect to GDP of 0.283, with a standard error of 0.148. This result is in line with previous studies
developed by Pinkovskiy and Sala-i Martin (2016) who ﬁnd a coeﬃcient of 0.661 when they do a similar
regression of the log light per capita on log GDP per capita13. Taken together, these results can bring
strong support to the hypothesis that the night-lights intensity can be used as a good proxy of economic
activity at a more disaggregated level (municipal level, which is the focus in our study).

5.3 Eﬀects of Coﬀee Price Shocks on Night-lights Density

[Table 2 approximately here]

Table 3 reports the main regression results of the average eﬀects of coﬀee price shocks on night-lights
density. It also shows in detail how the estimated treatment eﬀect varies across diﬀerent speciﬁcations.
In the baseline calculation, column (1), we only adjust for demographic characteristics (natural log
of population and coca cultivation). Then, we in each column add a diﬀerent set of controls. Thus,
column (2) adjusted the regression adding region ﬁxed eﬀects, while column adding (3) year ﬁxed
eﬀects. Column (4) reveals the estimated coeﬃcient from our preferred speciﬁcation. This regression
incorporates all the control of the ﬁrst three columns and department speciﬁc linear tends. The estimated
coeﬃcient suggests a positive and statistically diﬀerent from zero eﬀect, which suggests that the night-
lights intensity of coﬀee producer municipalities increases more in response to coﬀee prices increases
than coﬀee non-producer municipalities.

To interpret the magnitude of the estimated coeﬃcients, we consider the coﬀee boom represented
as the variation of the natural logarithm of coﬀee prices between 1994 and 1997 when coﬀee prices
increased by 0.20 log points . We also consider the average coﬀee intensity of municipalities in 1997,
which was 1.52 thousand hectares. Taken this together, the estimated coeﬃcient suggests an increase
of 0.014 in the natural log of night-lights density. When we compare this result with the mean of the
distribution, this increase reaches up to about 0.26% in the luminosity. This result aligns with the
ﬁndings in Corbi et al. (2014), who ﬁnd an increase in luminosity between 1.3 and 1.5 percent when the
Fundo de Participa¸c˜ao dos Munic´ıpios (FPM for its acronym in Spanish) increase in 10 percent.

5.4 Robustness Checks

[Table 3 approximately here]

We have conducted a number of diﬀerent speciﬁcation check in order to investigate the robustness of the
main ﬁnding. In Table 4, we estimate our main results using the average coﬀee intensity of municipalities
from the 1980 coﬀee census instead of 1997, the results are essentially unchanged14. We ﬁnd an estimate
coeﬃcient of 0.20 (standard error==0.082), which is statistically signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level of
signiﬁcance. The magnitude of this coeﬃcient is relatively similar to the baseline model.

13We also estimated this relationship using the variables in terms per capita and the results are very similar (Results

are available on request).

14The 1980 coﬀee census was conducted about one decade before our period of study, we believe that this measure are
not correlated with our dependent variable in the period studied. However, 1980 and 1997 coﬀee cultivation intensity are
strongly correlated.

6 Mechanims

As showed in previous section, there is a strong and positive relationship between the shock coﬀee
prices and night lights intensity. Nevertheless, what is behind this relationship? In this section, we
try to answer this question investigating some potential channels that may explain this relationship.
Speciﬁcally, we estimate our main speciﬁcation (equation 1 and 2) but use variables capturing this
potential mechanisms as a dependent variables. Again the variables are transformed using natural
logarithm, which the estimated coeﬃcient can be interpreted as elasticities due to our price shock
variable are measured in terms of log points also. Table 5 show the results our this exercise. More
speciﬁcally, the estimated coeﬃcient suggests a positive eﬀect of the price coﬀee shock on years of
education and a negative eﬀect on mortality. This results can be interpreted as a a better economic
condition of the coﬀee producer municipalities after the increase of international coﬀee prices.

7 Conclusion

This paper has oﬀered new evidence on the eﬀects of macroeconomic shocks on local economic growth
in a developing country. For this purpose, we have used a novel measure of local economic activity.
In particular, we have used data of satellite images on light density at night as a proxy of GDP. This
question is particularly important in developing countries where shock in commodities prices have an
important inﬂuence in the local economic activity and often data at sub-national level are not available
or are plagued with measurement errors. Thus, we can obtain a more accurate measure of local economic
growth that allows us to have a better understanding of the welfare of the population.

We advance in the understanding of how changes in environment economic aﬀect the local economic
growth. For that, this paper exploits the boom of coﬀee that Colombia experimented in the middle of
90s in order to explain the economic growth measured as the intensity of artiﬁcial light at night. Using
a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence as an empirical approach, our estimates provide two important results. First,
we identiﬁed that coﬀee producer municipalities’ experienced a diﬀerential and statistically signiﬁcant
increase in the night-lights density compared to non-coﬀee producer municipalities. Our main estimate
provides an elasticity in coﬀee price shock of 0.20 that can be understood as an increase of 0.26% in the
natural log of night-lights density if we compare with the respective mean of the distribution. Second,
we provide a new proxy of GDP at municipality level that could be useful for future researches once
data that are not available for this country.

Notes: The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the sum of luminosity intensity in municipality m, department

peak in 1997 – 1994, the coﬀee intensity (1.52), the estimated coeﬃcient, and dividing the resulting value by the mean of
the dependent variable. Robust standard errors clustered at department level are into parentheses. Following the strategy
development by Dube and Vargas (2013), we instrumentalize the interaction of the internal coﬀee price and coﬀee production
intensity by the interaction of coﬀee export volume of Brazil, Indonesia and Vietnam with temperature, rainfall, and rainfall
multiplying with temperature. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
