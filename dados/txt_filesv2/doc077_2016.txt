Abstract
Judicial efﬁciency matters for economic development. Nevertheless, the determinants of judicial productivity
growth are not entirely understood in the literature. Using data of Brazil’s state courts for the period of 2009
to 2014, this paper analyses judicial productivity change and its possible determinants over time in a two
stage approach. First, data envelopment analysis is used to calculate Malmquist productivity measures which
are decomposed in: technical change (frontier-shift effect) and efﬁciency change which is composed of pure
efﬁciency change (catch-up effect) and scale efﬁciency change (size effect). In the second stage, ﬁxed effect
models are estimated to evaluate the determinants of judicial productivity growth. The ﬁrst stage results show a
slight improvement in judicial productivity trend, which is deﬁned mainly by efﬁciency change, since technical
change deteriorated in the period. While the second stage ﬁndings suggest the inexistence of a trade-off between
judicial quality and efﬁciency improvement, while judges remuneration, legal complexity and technology use
affect judicial productivity, however not always in the expected direction.

Resumo
A eﬁciência judicial é importante para o desenvolvimento econômico, contudo os determinantes do cresci-
mento da produtividade da justiça não são totalmente compreendidos na literatura. Usando dados de tribunais
estaduais do Brasil para o período de 2009-2014, este artigo analisa a mudança da produtividade judicial e seus
possíveis determinantes ao longo do tempo em uma abordagem de dois estágios. Primeiro, a análise envoltória
de dados é usada para calcular medidas de produtividade de Malmquist que são decompostas em: mudança
tecnológica (frontier-shift effect) e mudança de eﬁciência, sendo esta dividida em mudança pura de eﬁciência
(catch-up effect) e mudança de eﬁciência de escala (size effect). Na segunda etapa, modelos de efeitos ﬁxos são
estimados para avaliar os determinantes do crescimento da produtividade judicial. Os resultados do primeiro
estágio mostram uma ligeira melhoria na evolução da produtividade judicial, deﬁnida principalmente pela vari-
ação da eﬁciência, uma vez que a mudança tecnológica se deteriorou no período. Por sua vez, os resultados
encontrados no segundo estágio sugerem a inexistência de um trade-off entre a qualidade judicial e a melhoria
da eﬁciência, enquanto que a remuneração do judiciário, a complexidade criminal e o uso de tecnologia afetam
a produtividade judicial, no entanto, nem sempre na direção esperada.

1. Introduction

Legal system effectiveness relies on efﬁcient courts. An unenforceable law is no different than an inexistent
rule. Economic agents react to incentives and the legal system is the basic society’s formal incentive framework.

1

However, an inducement mechanism only works if the incentives are credible, otherwise a rational agent would
be indifferent between following or not the norm. Law’s credibility derives mainly from its enforceability to
which the judiciary plays a central role.

As the New Institutional Economics has been showing, institutional design and performance are key factors
for economic development. The ﬁrmly establishment of the rule of law is essential to generate a stable and
predictable environment in developing countries. In addition to directly improve doing business conditions, it
is also crucial to overcome other social problems that affect these nations, such as corruption and human rights
violations. In this sense, since the nineties, the World Bank has been supporting justice reforms in emerging
economies. Initially, those programs were focused on legislation reforms. However, quickly the Bank realized
that laws alone would not be enough to achieve the reforms goals (World Bank, 2002). Therefore, it started to
encourage and provide assistance to develop the institutions responsible to implement and enforce the law in
these countries, thus mainly judicial reforms programs.

This new approach stimulated the creation of judicial statistics databases in several countries which favoured
the development of empirical studies on judicial efﬁciency1. Indeed, some research has been conducted even on
cross country basis (Buscaglia and Ulen, 1997, Dakolias, 1999, Blank et al., 2004). Although it is undeniably
important to assess legal institutions’s quality in a comparative perspective, cross nation judiciary efﬁciency
analyses are affected by the diversity of legislations which lessen their ability to reveal the managerial deter-
minants of court efﬁciency. Consequently, since at national level several factors that cannot be controlled by
the courts (such as the legislation) but can affect their efﬁciency are intrinsically controlled by the data, within-
country assessments have been more common (Pedraja-Chaparro and Salinas-Jimenez, 1996, Rosales-López,
2008, Yeung and Azevedo, 2011, Elbialy and García-Rubio, 2011, Dalton and Singer, 2013). However, most
of those studies are cross-section analysis which neglect the time variable. Time is the dimension in which
institutions evolve (North, 1994), thus it is crucial to reveal the determinants of judicial efﬁciency growth.

This paper analyses changes in judiciary efﬁciency and its determinants in a two stages approach. First,
data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to calculate the Malmquist index (a measure of productivity growth).
The use of a productivity change index is preferable since it allows an analysis of the judicial performance
evolution over time, including technical (innovation aspects) and efﬁciency variations. On the second stage,
ﬁxed effects models are estimated to assess the role of relevant variables, such as decision quality, courts’ and
external factors on productivity growth. As done by Posner (2000), Rosales-López (2008), Mitsopoulos and
Pelagidis (2010), Dimitrova-Grajzl et al. (2016), reversal rate is used as a proxy for judicial decisions quality.
The data used is from the 27 Brazil’s state courts for the period of 2009 to 2014. This country’s particularities,
especially its continental dimensions, population and cultural diversity2, combined with its relatively uniform
legislation provide a singular database. Moreover, the covered period did not register any major legislation
change (especially procedural law) while it encompasses different economic performances3.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The second section presents a discussion about the
importance of judiciary efﬁciency. Section 3 brieﬂy describes the structure of the Brazilian judiciary. Sections
4 and 5 present the methodology and the data used. Section 6 reports the results while section 7 concludes.

2. Judicial efﬁciency matters

Institutions play a central role in the economic development process. They are the incentives framework of a
society. How individuals will and should behave, thus shaping economic outcome, as it has been demonstrated

2Cultural traits might affect court efﬁciency, especially through the demand side (Landes, 1971, Vereeck and Muhl, 2000). How-
ever, in this paper those issues are controlled using ﬁxed effects regressions, admitting that these features do not have an abrupt
change in the short time.

by the new New Institutional Economics (North, 1991, Acemoglu et al., 2005). The legal system is an obvious
example of an institution. It represents the formal constraints that aim to frame people’s behavior, consequently
it must affect society’s economic performance as Law and Economics scholars have been revealing in the last
decades (Friedman, 2000, Ginsburg, 2000, Glaeser and Shleifer, 2002). However, a good legal system can only
make a difference if enforcement does exist, since without it individuals might not have incentives to obey the
rules of the game 4.

Adopting a Weberian concept5, the State is the ultimate law enforcer in a society. Indeed, as soon as it took
over the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force, it also dragged the obligation to protect its citizens’
rights. A modern state performs this duty through three branches: Legislative, Executive and Judiciary. The
ﬁrst one is responsible to enact the rules within a society. While the Executive’s task is to execute and enforce
the law, it can only well accomplish its mission if the law is interpreted and applied that are the functions of the
third one. In fact, the main function of the Judiciary is to exercise the State’s monopoly over jurisdiction (from
the Latin iuris, "law", and dicere, "to speak"). Indeed, considering that the emergence of the State itself is
related to dispute resolution6 (Hobbes, 1968), the judiciary is a fundamental institution in any modern society.
Its primary role is to assure society’s members that there is an ultimate impartial third party which will resolve
their disputes according to publicly available principles and rules, thus in a generally predictable manner Saez
Garcia (1998). Hence it reduces uncertainty, consequently fosters economic growth.

As stated by Ronald Coase (1960), transaction costs are a major obstacle for market efﬁciency. Among
them, enforcement costs are crucial. Contracts can only be efﬁciently concluded if the parties believe that the
counterpart will comply with the agreement’s clauses and if the promisor eventually breaches the contract, the
promisee will be able to take an appropriate action against him to resolve the dispute. However, this action is
not costless. To force a contractor to perform his promise (or to pay damages), in a modern society, means to
use the Judiciary7. Consequently, the cost of a lawsuit is essentially a transaction cost, thus the higher it is, the
less efﬁciently allocated the resources will be within a society.

Lawsuit’s costs can be classiﬁed as direct and indirect. The direct costs of a lawsuit are the amount of money
that the parties must spend to use the courts (lawyers’ remuneration, courts’ fees and so on). Indeed, those
expenses might even affect the access to justice, especially in developing economies (Fauvrelle and Almeida,
2013). Whereas indirect costs can be deﬁned as the nonmonetary ones (the time it takes, the decision’s quality
and so forth). Henceforth, the indirect costs of a lawsuit are intrinsically correlated to judiciary efﬁciency.

As deﬁned by Landes and Posner (1979), the judiciary produces both a private and a public good. The
decision taken by the court ends the parties’ dispute, thus it is a private good for the plaintiff and the defendant.
Nevertheless, at the same time, the decision creates also a precedent, an information which can be useful for
every society’s member that is facing (or will face) a situation similar to the one decided by the court, therefore
it is also a public good. In this sense, efﬁcient courts are in the best interest not only of the lawsuit’s parties,
but also in the interest of the entire community.

An efﬁcient judicial system might also indirectly enhance economic development. Expectations play a
central role in the economy. The belief that your property will be respected is a vital incentive to invest. In-
deed, as demonstrated by Torstensson (1994), Dincer (2007) and Besley and Ghatak (2010) property rights do
affect economic performance. In the case of developing countries, property rights’ deﬁnition and protection
might have an even stronger role (Sherwood et al., 1994). As found in Field (2005), strengthening property

of the legitimate use of physical force.

rights in urban slums increases residential investment. This is critical in order to overcome the favelas’ con-
ditions in which a large part of their population lives. Furthermore, as shown by Lichand and Soares (2014)
using Brazilian data, by securing property rights and enforcing contracts, the judiciary might also incentivize
entrepreneurship which is fundamental for long-term growth and aggregate productivity.

Judiciary efﬁciency is also important in crime deterrence. Considering Becker (1968), the crime level in a
society would be a function of, among other factors, the probability to be apprehended and convicted. Brieﬂy,
rational criminals balance the utility they can get by committing a wrongful act and the expected disutility of
its punishment. Since the expected penalty depends on the probability to be arrested and sentenced, an efﬁcient
judiciary should discourage crimes, hence decreases crime level, thus fosters social welfare. Moreover, as
the literature on drug prohibition has shown (Rasmussen et al., 1993, Cooney, 1997, Fryer et al., 2005), the
unavailability of non-violent dispute resolution mechanisms (mainly courts) is associated with criminality.
Concisely, since drugs are illicit, dealers and consumers cannot use ofﬁcial institutions (police, judiciary and
so on) to resolve their disputes. Hence, they need to use their own methods, mainly violence, to overcome
their problems. Analogically, it is straightforward to suppose a correlation between inefﬁcient judicial systems
and crime rates, since the extreme case (a completely inefﬁcient judiciary) would be no different than courts
unavailability.

Judicial inefﬁciency can also indirectly inﬂuence social welfare through human rights protection and cor-
ruption. Excessive pretrial detention is a clear example of how courts backlogs can directly violate individuals’
fundamental rights. Additionally, it also contributes to prison overcrowding, deteriorating the conditions of the
entire penitentiary system (Hafetz, 2002). Moreover, an weak judicial system is a condition to corruption (Jain,
2001). Indeed, corruption can be both cause and consequence of judicial inefﬁciency (Damania et al., 2004,
Ismail and Rashid, 2014).

3. Summary of the Brazilian Judiciary structure

Brazil is a civil law jurisdiction composed by 27 federal unities. Although the Federal Constitution provides
some autonomy in the law making process for the states (as well as for the federal district and the municipali-
ties), most of the Brazilian legislation is made on the Federal level. For instance, the civil and criminal codes
(together with the civil and procedure codes) are both federal laws. Consequently, the Federal Republic of
Brazil has a relatively uniform legislation, if compared to other federal states, such as the United States of
America.

The Federal Constitution also sets the guidelines for the organization of the judiciary. At the top of the
system is the Supreme Court which deals mainly only with constitutional cases (mostly appeals of lower Courts
decisions on constitutional matters). Below it, there are the specialized (Superior Labour Court, Superior
Military Court and Superior Electoral Court) and the general (Superior Court of Justice) superior courts, all
located in Brazil’s capital city (Brasilia). The specialized tribunals have also lower courts (regional court of
labour, regional electoral court and so on), usually one for each state, which are the second instance for the
ﬁrst level specialized judges. Since Brazil is a federation, it has Federal and State courts, both of them have
the Superior Court of Justice as the third level tribunal. The Federal judiciary has its competence speciﬁed by
the Constitution (basically cases involving the Federal State itself, indigenous communities, international cases
and other speciﬁc proceedings).

Henceforth, the state courts’ competence is residual: everything that the Constitution does not specify
to another judiciary branch must be judged by them. Consequently, the majority8 of the cases in Brazil are
handled by the state courts. Every federal unit (26 states and the federal district which is considered in this
work as a state) has its own ﬁrst instance (state judges) and appellate courts. Although, the federal law (Federal
Constitution and the National Judiciary Organic Law) provides the general guidelines for their framework, the

8For instance, in 2014, the state courts received about 70% of the new cases ﬁlled in the entire Brazilian judicial system.

states are responsible for the organization of their own judiciary. As a consequence, each state has a different
structure: the quantity of judges and public servants, their remuneration, the number and specialization degree
of the judicial districts, the budget and so forth. Therefore, considering that the legislation applied by the courts
is basically the same across the country, the differences among courts’ productivities should be inﬂuenced by
their own factors.

4. Methodology

To achieve the goals set, this empirical analysis is comprised by two stages. The ﬁrst builds a productivity
index of the courts using nonparametric efﬁciency measures. The second stage evaluates the relationship
between productivity growth and relevant factors that might affect it, as set by the literature.

4.1. Stage 1: Malmquist Index

According to Färe et al. (1994b) and Färe and Grosskopf (1996), the Malmquist index measures the total
factor productivity (TFP) change over time, where this indicator can be decomposed into two main components:
efﬁciency change (EC) and technical change (TC). The former, also known as catch-up effect, measures relative
efﬁciency over time, indicating whether production converges or diverges to the frontier. If EC>1, we have a
convergence process, in which courts with initial low productivity levels adopt more efﬁcient techniques already
implemented by the other courts. The TC, alias frontier-shift effect, captures the change in productivity which
is due to innovation. This index based on input and output data using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was
developed by Färe et al. (1994b).

Färe et al. (1994b) calculate the Malmquist productivity index using a geometric mean of two reasons: the
ﬁrst uses as a reference the frontier of the period t and then the frontier of the period t + 1. This indicator is a
geometric mean of two ratios of function distance9, considering the technical frontier at different moments and
the relationship between outputs (y) and inputs (x). Equation 1 expresses the Malmquist index:

(cid:20) dt(xt+1, yt+1)

dt(xt, yt)

(cid:21)1/2

m(xt+1, yt+1, xt, yt) = m =

× dt+1(xt+1, yt+1)

dt+1(xt, yt)

.

(1)

Note that m > 1 reveals an improvement in the judicial productivity between periods t and t + 1, while
m < 1 indicates a decline in TFP. Equation 2 shows the Malmquist index decomposed into change of TC (or
frontier-shift effect) and EC (or catch-up effect):

dt+1(xt+1, yt+1)

where: EC =

. The TC is calculated as

The DEA approach calculates the functions distance d(·). In short, to calculate m it is necessary to resolve
four linear programming problems. In all cases, we have: λ ≥ 0.
where: x and y represent a given input and output used in t and t−1, X and Y indicate the vectors of inputs and
outputs, λ is a weight, φ is the efﬁciency score ∈ [1,∞] and θ = (φ)−1 represent the efﬁciency score ∈ [0, 1].
In two problems (A, B), the functions distance evaluate the decision making units (DMUs) with the cor-
responding technology available (contemporary frontier), and others evaluate the production plans in a given
period with the technology of another moment in time (C, D). In this work, following Färe et al. (1994b), we

To calculate the rate of productivity growth between 2009 and 2014, we adopt the Malmquist method of

assessment with adjacent periods, i.e.:

m(xt+1, yt+1, xt, yt), m(xt+2, yt+2, xt+1, yt+1), ..., m(xt+n, yt+n, xt+n−1, yt+n−1).

In the VRS model the constraint(cid:80) λi = 1 is included in d(·) equations. When calculating the efﬁciency

scores, we can project the optimal level of inputs and outputs. Thus, we compute the goals projected by the
DEA model in order to make each DMU efﬁcient using Equation 3.

We identify the type of returns to scale from the following inequality: if θV RS = θCRS, the DMU operates

are equal, the DMU operates with excess of inputs (decreasing scale); otherwise, the DMU operates with
increasing scales (Färe et al., 1994a, Ramanathan, 2003).

The changes in scale efﬁciency (SC), based on Färe et al. (1994b), is deﬁned by: SC =

EC and PEC respectively are calculated by DEA-CRS and DEA-VRS. Therefore, we can verify in Malmquist
index the scale effect over time:

4.2. Stage 2: Econometrics with panel data

The procedures described in the ﬁrst stage allow the calculation of the judicial productivity growth rates
for the period under analysis. Then, to assert the impact of its possible determinants, a panel data with ﬁxed
effects model is estimated according to the Equation 6:

ln Y j

(cid:48)
(cid:48)
itα + γt + ai + it
itΓ + EF
it = β0 + β1RRit + CF

(6)
where: ln Yit represents the indicator j of the State Court i in period t, with j ={Malmquist index (m), efﬁ-
ciency change (EC), technical change (TC)}; RR is Reversal rate, used as proxy for judicial decision quality;
CF is a vector with information about courts factors, including remuneration of jugdes and judicial staff, in-
vestment rate, technology resources used by each court (investment and electronic ﬁling); EF is a vector that
include external factors to the courts such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and a index for legal par-
ticularities (rate of criminal cases); ai is the ﬁxed effect involving the environment conditions of each Courts i

(such as cultural diversity, moral aspects etc.); γt captures the ﬁxed effect of time in the year t; it is the random
error term.

A main concern about improving judicial productivity is if it would not be caused by a decrease in the
quality of the decisions. For instance, a system in which, instead of analyzing the cases, the judges just ﬂip a
coin to decide a case would be tremendously efﬁcient from a quantitative perspective. However, as discussed
in section two, the judiciary’s primary role is to reduce uncertainty, resolving disputes in a predictable manner.
Consequently, quality is as important as quantitative efﬁciency. The result of the parameter β1 aims to capture
if the quality of the decisions is related to judicial productivity growth. The percentage of sentences reversed
by the upper court is used as a proxy for judicial output quality, as done by Posner (2000), Rosales-López
(2008), Mitsopoulos and Pelagidis (2010), Dimitrova-Grajzl et al. (2016). Will the courts with higher quality
index (lower reversal rate) have productivity losses? The estimation of the β1 coefﬁcient aims to answer this
question.

According to the fair wage-effort hypothesis (Akerlof and Yellen, 1990), salary and effort, thus productivity,
are positively correlated. Moreover, the public choice model of judicial decision making predicts that judges10,
as everybody else, follow self interest rules (Shepherd, 2011). Indeed, as Posner (1993) proposed, judges are
rational agents and utility maximizers. Furthermore, Deyneli (2012) highlights that higher remuneration might
incentivize productivity and reduce the chances of corruption. Additionally to the incentives-effort effect,
higher remuneration can also make the judge’s career more attractive for high quality workers. However, Choi
et al. (2009) suggest that higher wages would only affect judicial efﬁciency if judges could be sanctioned due to
bad performance (mainly facing termination risk) and if the judge’s selection process is sophisticated enough
to screen out low-ability candidates.

Investment is, by deﬁnition, an expenditure related to an expected increase on the future production, thus it
should affect productivity growth. Speciﬁcally, technology investment rate is expected to positively inﬂuence
the dependent variable since it improves the degree of informatisation. As Palumbo et al. (2013) suggested,
spending on computerisation should smooth court functioning and improve its efﬁciency, mainly by promoting
new case-ﬂow management techniques. Indeed, a good degree of informatisation permits the introduction of
better procedures to monitor and enforce judicial deadlines. Furthermore, it can contribute to improve courts
accountability and transparency (Kourlis and Gagel, 2008).

Electronic ﬁling is a proxy for the diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) among
courts. As discussed above, the use of new technologies should increase courts efﬁciency, thus a higher per-
centage of new cases ﬁled electronically is expected to positively affect the court productivity.

GDP per capita and the rate of criminal cases are the external factors, in the sense that they might inﬂuence
the courts’ efﬁciency, but cannot be controlled by the court. The former is used to estimate the impacts of
socioeconomic factors on judicial productivity, as done by Djankov et al. (2003), Gorman and Ruggiero (2009).
The latter is used as a proxy for particularities of the substantive/procedural law. In a cross-country analysis,
Djankov et al. (2003) found that legal formalism might affect judicial efﬁciency. Criminal and civil cases are
formally distinct, following a different path in the judiciary. For instance, since criminal and non criminal cases
have diverse burden of proof standards (Fleming Jr., 1961), they have different complexity levels. In this sense,
the rate of criminal cases tries to capture the effects of the legislation on judicial productivity.

5. Data

The data used in this paper was extracted from the database of the Courts in Figures which is an annual
report developed by the Brazilian National Council of Justice (Conselho Nacional de Justiça). It covers all the

10Due to data limitation, the remuneration of judges and justice staff is used as a proxy for judges’ wages. Indeed, notwithstanding
the fact that the judge is the main decision maker, it is plausible to assume that the court’s output is a result of the judge’s and his
staff’s efforts combined.

The variables used in the second stage are reported in Table 2. According to Posner (2000), Rosales-López
(2008), Mitsopoulos and Pelagidis (2010), Deyneli (2012), the selected variables aim to identify the role of
decision’s quality (measures by reversal rate), courts’ factors (remuneration, investment rate, technology rate
and electronic ﬁling) and external factors (GDP per capita and rate of criminal cases) on growth of judicial
productivity.

Since the goal is to study the determinants of productivity growth rate and its components (efﬁciency change
and technical change), the regression model is made for 5 periods. Given the existence of missing values in
reversal rate, we estimate a panel data model with ﬁxed effects to an unbalanced panel which made the total
number of observations drop from 135 to 131.

6. Results

6.1. Judicial Efﬁciency

Productivity growth and its components were calculated for the 27 Brazilian state courts over the period
2009-2014. As one of the basic components of the Malmquist index is the efﬁciency change, Table 3 reports
the evolution of pure technical efﬁciency over time for each Brazilian state court.

Under the assumption of variable returns to scale (VRS), Table 3 shows that most Brazilian State courts
were technically inefﬁcient between 2009 and 2014. On average, the overall level of pure efﬁciency was 0.83,
indicating that the number of judgments (output indicator) could increase by about 20% per year.

Between 2009 and 2014, the courts of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Roraima (RR), Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Sao
Paulo (SP) and Acre (AC) show the best performance in terms of higher production results with lower input
use. Among the most efﬁcient units there are courts located in both more (RJ, RS and SP) and less (RR and
AC) developed states in Brazil.

At the bottom of the rank, the courts of Piaui (PI) and Mato Grosso (MT) have the worst technical per-
formance over time. For example, Court of PI in 2009, given the resources used, should increase its judicial
production by 2.33 times. On global average (2009-2014), considering the score of 0.44 and taking into account
the benchmarks units, the Court of PI would need to increase its production by 127.3% per year to optimize
the input-output relationship.

A relevant literature on judicial efﬁciency (Finocchiaro Castro and Guccio, 2012, Schneider, 2005, Yeung
and Azevedo, 2011, Deyneli, 2012) relies on the assumption that courts operate with constant returns to scale
(CRS) which implies that the courts’ sizes are optimal. However, as Voigt (2016) discusses, this is not always
the case. Courts may operate with variable returns to scale (VRS). Some judicial units might have increasing
return to scale, while others can be already too big.

Table 4 shows the scale efﬁciency of the courts in the period, including the dominant scale types of the
court in each period. These results complement the previous analysis, because the courts may be technically
efﬁcient and operate in an incorrect production scale or be doubly inefﬁcient (in technical and scale terms).
And yet, the DMU can operate on an optimal scale of production and have technical efﬁciency.

Most State Courts of Brazil operate with increasing returns to scale over time (see Table 4), indicating
that in addition to pure technical inefﬁciency the courts have problems related to incorrect scale functioning.
Among the technically efﬁcient Courts, only Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Rio Grande do Sul (RS) do not have scale
problems between 2009 and 2014, operating at optimal scale of production. On the other hand, Roraima (RR)
and Sao Paulo (SP) feature scale inefﬁciency, the ﬁrst of which operates with increasing returns and the second
works basically with decreasing returns.

The courts with increasing and decreasing returns present more problems in the input-output relationship
(technical efﬁciency problem) than in incorrect scale production. Evaluating the production, the units with
optimal scale of production have an output, on average, higher in 11.9% than those operating with decreasing
returns. While in the inputs, these differences are even more pronounced, reﬂecting the DMUs with decreasing
returns also work with excess human and ﬁnancial resources – particularly in the number of judges and the
courts expenditures.

What would be the adjustments in inputs and output in the aggregate to transform technically inefﬁcient
units into efﬁcient ones? To answer this question, Figure 1 shows the cumulative adjustments, based on DEA-
VRS model, to the inputs and outputs to increase judicial efﬁciency. Therefore, this illustration presents ac-

year.

Although the efﬁciency model is output-oriented, DMUs exhibit excess in the use of inputs, such that
assuming the possibility of all courts adjusting their inputs and outputs, we would have globally reductions in
all considered inputs and an average expansion of output in 13.26%. Among the inputs, those with higher slacks
were the court expenditures and the number of judges, which on average would need to be reduced respectively
by 12.6 % and 11.7% in the period. What is noticeable regarding these results is that in order to achieve
technical efﬁciency, inefﬁcient courts should increase their relative production and necessarily minimize the
use of ﬁnancial and human resources.

In practical terms, given contractual rigidity in the Brazilian public sector (specially with human resources),
adjustments should primarily occur in the output level of courts and/or by frontier shifting up (improvements
in technological change). Thus, for a better evaluation of the judicial productivity over time, also taking into
account the technical changes, Table 6 presents the Malmquist index and its components for each state court.
Note that the Malmquist index can be obtained by two approaches: m = T C × EC or m = T C × P EC × SC.
In the last approach, we detail the changes in scale efﬁciency.

The results presented in Table 6 are summarized by the global average which demonstrates that Brazilian
courts showed a slight tendency to improve their productivity in the period. The average productivity growth
by Malmquist index was 1.5% per year. This productivity growth, on average, can be attributed more to the
efﬁciency component than to innovation (technological change). We observe, globally, that 57.8% of the State
courts during the study period present a progress in net productivity. This information conﬁrms the trend of a
slight improvement in judicial productivity over time.

As it can be seen more clearly in Figure 2a, the evolution of judicial productivity in Brazil occurs unsteadily,
being basically deﬁned by efﬁciency changes over time. With the exception of 2009-2010, throughout the
designated period the technical change evolved under EC and Malmquist index, with a downward trend in the
period.

Decomposing the efﬁciency change over time, we note from Figure 2b that pure efﬁciency change has
superimposed the effects of changes in efﬁciency scale. Globally, the EC has a growth of 4%, with 82.5% of
which is due to the catch-up effect (pure efﬁciency change). Despite the average annual growth, changes in
scale effect contribute only 17.5% with EC growth over time.

Indeed, among all courts only RJ, with an average annual technical change of 2.3%, progressed from a
technological perspective (positive frontier effect). All the other tribunals faced a decrease in the technical
change indicator (negative frontier effect). The courts with higher rates of productivity growth per year were,
respectively, Alagoas (AL, 21.1%), Piaui (PI, 14.3%) and Mato Grosso (MT, 11.1%). Decomposing the pro-
ductivity indicator, we ﬁnd that the key to achieving growth for these courts was due to better input-output ratio
(pure efﬁciency change) obtained by these courts.

As seen in Table 3, these courts (AL, PI and MT) have the lowest technical efﬁciency indicators. Consid-
ering the hypothesis of diminishing marginal returns, the most inefﬁcient units tend to have a higher relative
evolution in time.

6.2. Econometric Results

Table 7 evidences the econometric results of the relationship between judicial productivity change (Malmquist

index) and the variables discussed in the methodology (decision quality, courts’ and external factors). The es-
timations are made by ﬁxed effect model with cluster-robust standard errors.

The statistical insigniﬁcance of the reversal rate on judicial efﬁciency improvement, in all the models,
suggests that the productivity improvement is not a result of a decrease in judicial decisions quality, which is in
line with the results found by Rosales-López (2008), Dimitrova-Grajzl et al. (2016). Consequently, it supports
the assumption that judicial efﬁciency and quality maximization are not mutually exclusive.

The positive effect of remuneration on judicial productivity change is in line with the public choice model
of judicial decision-making and also with the ﬁndings of Deyneli (2012). Considering the coefﬁcient in model
(4), which presents the best ﬁt and speciﬁcation, a change of 1% in remuneration increases the productivity
growth by 0.53%. This evidence can support the assumption that well paid judges are more motivated, thus
more productive. It also suggests that courts which pay the highest salaries attract the most productive workers.
Considering Choi et al. (2009) and that, in Brazil, judges are protected by life tenure, the second interpretation
seems more plausible.

Both general and technological investment rates are not statistically signiﬁcant. This result can suggest that
either the courts are badly investing or that their investment returns do not affect the same year output11. GDP
per capita also does not affect judicial productivity, in any of the models, suggesting that judicial productivity
growth does not depend on social-economic factors.

The negative and statistically signiﬁcant estimate of the new cases electronically ﬁled might seem counter-
intuitive, since more paperless lawsuits were expected to result in more efﬁcient courts. The model shows that
a marginal change in the percentage of electronic ﬁling generates, on average, a reduction of approximately
0.22% in judicial productivity growth. However, a possible explanation for this issue is the fact that electronic
ﬁling systems are a relatively new technology and the employees would need time to adapt to this new tech-
nique. Moreover, the technology itself changed over the years which might support the adaption hypothesis.
Indeed, in the beginning (late 00’s), there was no uniformity in the electronic cases technology which means
that several different kinds of paperless systems were adopted by the courts. It was only in 2011 that the Na-

11This hypothesis could be tested introducing a lag on those variables. However, the database time series length analysed in this

paper is too short to perform this task.

15

tional Council of Justice decided to release an uniform system (“Processo Judicial Eletrônico-PJe”) which has
been gradually implemented by the courts. This explanation is reinforced by the result of this coefﬁcient in the
TC(1) model in Table 8 which shows that this variable contributes to induce a negative frontier-shift effect.

Table 8 reports the role of explanatory variables considered on the decomposition of productivity measures
change (EC and TC). These relationships aim to complement the previous analysis, because we can see if there
are differences between the determinants of the EC (efﬁciency) and TC (technological) growth.

Basically, the main results of EC(2) model, such as monetary incentives and null statistical effect of the
reversal rate, replicate the signals observed on the determinants of productivity growth. This replication ﬁnding
was expected, since the behavior of the Malmquist index, as done in the previous subsection, is deﬁned over
time by efﬁciency change. Thus, estimates of the determinants of technological change (frontier effect) are
differentiated information exhibited in Table 8.

The negative coefﬁcient of the criminal cases rate on the TC(2) model is interesting from a Law and Eco-
nomics perspective. It suggests that particularities of the substantive/procedural law do affect judicial pro-
ductivity through a reduction in the technical component, which is in line with the ﬁndings of Djankov et al.
(2003). Indeed, combining the results of that variable with the years’ coefﬁcients (which capture the conjunc-
ture variables that affect all the courts) in this model might suggest that the legislation in Brazil evolved in a
manner that decreased the innovation growth of the courts.

7. Concluding remarks

The New Institutional Economics states that institutions matter for economic growth since they form the
incentives framework of a society. Among them, the legal system is an important element for the economy’s
performance, as the Law and Economics have established. However, the laws’ effectiveness relies on judicial
efﬁciency. Hence, efﬁcient courts are a key factor for society’s welfare maximization.

16

In this work, we provide evidence that Brazilian courts globally had an average slight improvement in judi-
cial productivity between 2009 and 2014. Thus, the initiatives developed by the courts are generating progress
in terms of efﬁciency change, however this development has not occurred equally among all state courts and
the speed of change is still slow (about 1.5% per year). An important result observed is that the evolution of
total productivity is being deﬁned by gains in efﬁciency scale and, specially, pure efﬁciency change. Despite
the relative improvement of the input-output relationship, the Brazil’s state courts technical frontier declined
on average by 1.7% per year over time, with the exception of Rio de Janeiro’s court. Consequently, the pro-
ductivity trend of the courts in the analyzed period can be seen as a consequence of the convergence process
in which the tribunals with low initial efﬁciency levels recover their productivity gap in relation to the most
efﬁciency courts instead of being an innovation result.

Finally, the regression analysis revealed the determinants of judicial productivity growth.

It suggested
the nonexistence of a trade-off between judicial decisions’ quality and efﬁciency improvement. Among the
courts’ factors, the model conﬁrmed the assumption that wages and productivity are positively correlated.
Nevertheless, it also shown that technology introduction might not always produce the expected results, at least
in the short run. Furthermore, the model results conﬁrmed the assumption that Law particularities matters for
judicial performance, which is in line with the Law and Economics literature.
