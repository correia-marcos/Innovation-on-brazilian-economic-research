Abstract

This paper investigates how Bitcoin’s (BTC) return volatility is affected by its own innovative aspects, by
the main global ﬁnancial market indicators, and by shocks on volatility and uncertainty. The strategy was
ﬁrst estimate structural break tests to ﬁnd signiﬁcative regime switching in BTC returns. Next conditional
volatility parameters are estimated from multivariate perspective using the DCC-MGARCH model. At this
stage, the Standard & Poor 500 index, China’s SSEC stock index and the price of gold were used to estimate
the quasi-covariances and quasi-correlations matrices. In the last step it was also estimated impulse response
functions to understand how BTC returns are affected by risk and uncertainty shocks coming from distinct
sources. It was found that there are many factors and uncertainty surrounding the BTC market microstructure
and indicators of a speculative bubble from the end of 2017 to mid-2018.

1 Introduction

Some postindustrial events highlight how the worldwide economy is changing. This is evidenced by massive
investments on the production of intangible goods, such as information, services, values, symbols, and aesthetics,
which has been accelerated by portable technology, such as the smartphone, along with ﬁnancial innovation
(World Economic Forum, 2015). Hence, instruments of exchange have materialized as digital payment methods,
also known as ﬁntechs, e.g., as digital wallets, such as PayPal, Google Wallet, MoneyGram, Apple Pay, and
Venmo. This payments’ ecosystem also includes cryptocurrencies, which are similar to other e-commerce tools.
Examples such as Bitcoin (BTC), bKash (Bangladesh), NEO (China), mPesa (Kenya), and Auroracoin (Iceland),
Coinbase – which link bank accounts or credit cards to cryptocurrencies, suggest that cash is following the path
of information goods.

This ﬁntechs make new business proﬁtable by introducing less bureaucratic and costly protocols to process
information (Baur and Dimpﬂ, 2018; Luther, 2016b). Merge of technologies are also observed as the Gemini,
which is a regulated cryptocurrency exchange, and the creation of the BitLicense1 in 2015. In April 2017 BTC
was recognized as a currency by Japan. In October of the same year, the US Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) approved LedgerX as the ﬁrst company to serve as a clearinghouse for cryptocurrencies
using swaps. In March 2018, Germany also recognized BTC as a currency. Lagarde (2017) forecasts the end of
the current state of the art of banking and the popularization of cryptocurrency, calling this dollarization 2.0.

These events were followed by the launching BTC futures contracts on December 10, 2017 by the Chicago
Board Options Exchange (CBOE) (Baur and Dimpﬂ, 2019). Eight days later, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
& Chicago Board of Trade (CME Group) initiated similar operations. In this sense, besides being the ﬁrst
cryptocurrency, BTC has the higher disruptive impact among the more of 1,634 known cryptocurrency. However,
this complex ecosystem of cryptocurrencies is contestable, since there are 1,634 non-BTC entrants to date
competing in the market (White, 2015). It is a digital token with the highest daily trading volume on the ﬁnancial
markets, an open source accounting system, with a ledger that resides on thousands of computers.

Although, the adoption of cryptocurrencies depends on a special type of network externality where the degree
of utility gained by an individual (node) depends on the number of users (other nodes) of the same good, i.e., the
network matters (Catalini and Gans, 2017). The blockchain, which keeps track of all BTC transactions, has been
making possible new smart-contract applications (Fanning and Centers, 2016). Part because it is not possible to
duplicable BTC by its users Miller (2014) and this make possible to introduce continuous competition in this
market (Lo and Wang, 2014; White, 2015). Nonetheless, BTC is often diffuse and too opaque for regulators as
well, which affects its price, brings volatility and also evidence of an speculative bubble from end of 2017 to
mid-2018 (Corbet et al, 2018a).

Rumors, hack attacks, and other orthogonal events suggests that BTC price formation depends on multivariate
events, and that there are much uncertainty in this market (Fang et al, 2019). The role of information technology,
new understandings of BTC behavior and applications, which also includes its acceptance as payment method,
are among their ﬁrst obstacles. Facing so many simultaneously events, this paper provides multivariate empirical
evidence of how distinct sources of volatility, risk and uncertainty shocks affect BTC returns. The main global
ﬁnancial market indicators were used to assemble new evidence on some previous univariate contributions such
as Lo and Wang (2014), Ciaian et al (2016), Frascaroli and Pinto (2016), Urquhart (2016), Chan et al (2017),
Scaillet et al (2017), Ardia et al (2018), Baur and Dimpﬂ (2018), Blau (2018), Li et al (2015), Peng et al (2018),
Zargar and Kumar (2018), Silva et al (2019) and Zargar and Kumar (2019).

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index (S&P500), China’s main stock index (SSEC) and the price of gold (XAU)
(Klein et al, 2018) are used. Such ﬁndings will be important to understand what are the sources of BTC volatility
and how markets could deal with it. The empirical strategy is composed of four steps which tries to control the

ﬁndings considering distinct sources of volatility, risk and uncertainty shocks. Thus, the ﬁrst step is to estimate
the structural breaks in BTC returns, considering historical events that may have affected its dynamics. Second,
the univariate volatility parameters of BTC returns are estimated. Third, a multivariate empirical investigation to
track BTC return volatility is detailed. In the fourth step, BTC conditional volatility and estimated residuals
were used as inputs in a vector autoregressive framework to simulate impulse response shocks coming from
distinct sources, including uncertainty.

This paper is divided into ﬁve sections in addition to this brief section 1. section 2 describe the literature
review. Next, section 3 provides the empirical strategy. Sample planning and treatment are detailed in section 4.
The empirical ﬁndings obtained are discussed in section 5, and section 6 delivers summary and conclusions.

2 Literature

BTC is the name of the cryptocurrency, its units, and the payment network on which the digital tokens are
stored, traded and moved. The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on 18 August, 2008 developed by
Satoshi (2008). The ﬁrst protocol was put in practice with BTC using peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to run
decentralized value trade through a collective trust agreement process by using independent computer networks.
This allows BTC trading be validated using algorithms, where each computer works simultaneously as a server
and a user, i.e., such network enables operations without the strict need for third parties. In this framework,
miners are one of the most important components as their computers are tasked to process new transactions
coming onto the blockchain ledger and constantly updating it (Corbet et al, 2018b).

This makes BTC resembles mineral-types of money because its supply theoretically expands according to a
known stochastic process, in which a hash2 function can map variable-length data and return ﬁxed-length data.
The mining structures compete to receive the payout in synthetic commodity money every ten minutes, making
BTC similar to electronic money (Selgin, 2015). They are forced to search for a number, based on prime number
algorithms created to be deﬂationary by nature, i.e., the core protocol itself is in charge of preventing new issues.
Thus, they could be efﬁcient from the point of view of inﬂation (Rogoff, 2014), besides enable more secure,
agile and customized ﬁnancial services.

Hence, while anyone can use computers to mine BTC, only specialized hardware is capable of winning this
race. Such decentralized, globally distributed and competitive network system make sure that the blockchain
be trustworthy. This also because the system allows each network node to hold a copy of the blockchain itself
(Luther, 2016a). It means that each BTC user can have as many public keys as desired, but at least two keys: one
public and one private. The public key identiﬁes the user on the network and uses a digital signature algorithm
called ECDSA (Nair and Cachanosky, 2017). As the public key assigns a hash to each new information, it is
possible to confront the transaction to the trader’s public key, eliminating the possibility of double spending
(Chakravorti et al, 2016).

This open source transparency is one of the most important factors of BTC market microstructure because
allows data scientists and researchers worldwide to collaborate in a digital platform innovation3. However,
while it is possible to verify in the blockchain the traded amounts of BTC at any time, it is not possible to
directly identify users involved in the transactions. This makes cryptocurrencies able to support criminal
activities4, ransom and Ponzi schemes (Foley et al, 2018). Fanusie and Robinson (2018) found that a quarter of

2A hash is a unique data identiﬁer consisting of 64 characters, in a one-way function. Thus, each block mined informs the next

block’s hash (Paar and Pelzl, 2010).

3One example is the Airfox, a Boston-based mobile ﬁnancial services company, which is using the blockchain to provide a cheaper,

easier (through an app), and much more modern alternative to credit access in Brazil.

4Locky Ransomware attack12, the OneCoin scheme and the Silk Road website, which was mainly used to trafﬁc narcotics in 2013,

and AlphaBay, shut down in July 2017, are also examples of this misuse of cryptocurrencies (Fanusie and Robinson, 2018).

all transactions went into Europe (2015-16), which hosted 38% to 57% of all illicit transactions, while Gandal
et al (2018) identiﬁed episodes of suspicious trading activity and frauds.

Moreover, these risks are increased by hack attacks, such as that against Mt. Gox, a popular Japanese
exchange company that has been hit more than 150,000 times by hackers and declared in February 2014 that
750,000 BTC had been stolen. Another attack was registered in August 2016, against the major BTC exchange
Bitﬁnex, when nearly 120,000 BTC were stolen. This approximately $65 USD million theft caused a 10%
drop in BTC price, and all transactions on the virtual exchange were suspended. It took one week for the
security breach to be investigated and transactions reestablished. This also characterize a vulnerability, since
approximately 40% of the world’s total BTC is owned by 1,000 users, e.g., more than $100 million BTC per
person on average.

Empirical evidence has point out that BTC returns follow non-normal distribution, exhibit heavy tails (Chan
et al, 2017), is subject to jumps (Scaillet et al, 2017) and regime changes (Ardia et al, 2018; Silva et al, 2019).
On the other hand, while 60% of BTC is mined by ﬁve entities, F2Pool, AntPool, BW.COM, BTCC Pool and
ViaBTC, Choi et al (2018) found that network limit the ability of arbitrages in this market. They also indicate
that the BTC premia are positively related to transaction costs, conﬁrmation time in the blockchain, and to
BTC return volatility. Concerning such volatility, there is evidence of long memory (Peng et al, 2018; Zargar
and Kumar, 2018, 2019), asymmetry distribution (Baur and Dimpﬂ, 2018), and volatility transmission among
cryptocurrencies (Yi et al, 2018).

Furthermore, the recent remarkable increase in BTC prices at the end of 2017 and its fall in ﬁrst six months
of 2018 has raised the question of whether it has just experienced one of history’s biggest speculative bubbles.
Blanchard and Watson (1982) highlight that bubbles have mostly been accompanied by volatility in international
events. The questions addressed here are important puzzles, which reinforce risks and uncertainties around BTC.
Thus, a business that makes use of cryptocurrencies needs to carefully consider its risks (Grant and Hogan, 2015;
Choi et al, 2018). Thus, is necessary to identify global drivers and uncertainty sources of BTC price formation
and access its valuation.

3 Empirical strategy
3.1 Dynamic conditional correlation multivariate GARCH model

The estimation of volatility from autocorrelations, the mean and the variance of BTC returns comes from the
pioneering contributions of Bollerslev (1982) and Bollerslev (1986). In addition to estimating structural changes
that affect BTC price dynamics, a dynamic speciﬁcation of the MGARCH is used to estimate BTC conditional
volatility and to identify the drivers of its quasi-covariances and quasi-correlations. The multivariate framework
provides information about other stochastic processes important to predicting BTC returns and volatility. Engle
(2002) developed the DCC-MGARCH, wherein Rt follows a GARCH (1,1) process. The parameters of Rt are
not standardized to be correlations and are called quasi-correlations. To maintain parsimony, all correlations are
constrained to follow the same dynamics.

The DCC-MGARCH is signiﬁcantly more ﬂexible and does not introduce a much larger number of pa-
rameters for the number of stochastic processes. It utilizes weighted nonlinear combinations of time-variant
univariate GARCH. The diagonal elements of Ht are modeled using univariate GARCH. The remaining elements
are estimated by nonlinear functions based on the terms resulting from the diagonal:

(1)
where the terms hii,t and h j j,t characterize the GARCH process, and ρi j,t represents the dynamic process (Engle,
2002). The DCC-MGARCH can be written using a DVECH (1,1) as follows:

hi j,t = ρi j,t + σi,tσ j,t

independent variable vector that may contain lags of yt, H1/2
is the Cholesky factor of the time-variant
conditional covariance matrix Ht, vt is a vector of order mx1, which is a vector of zero mean and i.i.d. with unit
variance, and Dt is a diagonal conditional variance matrix, which in this case has a (4 x 4) dimension.

When Qt is stationary, the matrix R is the weighted average of the covariance matrix of the standardized
residuals ˜εt. It is denoted by ¯R and the unconditional average of Qt, described by ¯Qt. Because Qt (cid:54)= Rt, R
does not represent the correlation matrix or the unconditional average of Qt. For this reason, the parameters
in R are called quasi-correlations. Alternatively, the estimator developed by Tse and Tsui (2002) assumes the
VECH-diagonal form. This means that Equation 5 also applies to the conditional covariance terms in which
i,t is replaced, for instance, by εi,t for 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ K. Therefore, considering
σ2
i,t is replaced by σi,t− j, and ε2
their contribution, it is also assume that the time-varying conditional correlation matrix εt is generated from the
recursion:

where Γ = {ρi j} is a time-invariant KxK matrix, also deﬁned as a positive parameter matrix, with unit diagonal
elements; and Ψt−1 is a KxK matrix whose elements are functions of the lagged εt. The parameters θ1 and θ2
are free of the non-negative condition, since it was ﬁt a univariate EGARCH in ﬁrst step of estimations. Tse

and Tsui (2002) point out that Γt is a weighted average of Γ, Γt−1 and ψt−1. If ψt−1 and Γ0 are well-deﬁned
correlation matrices, Γt will also be a well-deﬁned correlation matrix. They propose considering the following
speciﬁcation for Ψt−1 = ψi j,t:

∑M
h=1 εi,t−hε j,t−h

h=1 ε2

The ﬁtted models EGARCH (p,q), introduced by Nelson (1991), and the Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle
GARCH (GJR-GARCH) model (Glosten et al, 1993) do not need the non-negativity constraint of the parameters
for the variance be not negative. Thus, unlike the symmetric GARCH (p,q), these functional forms provide
better ﬁt. The EGARCH conditional variance in logarithmic form is expressed as:

It is assumed that the impact of η2

t on the conditional variance h2
t is distinct depending on whether ηt is
positive or negative. Hence, It−l is a dummy variable, i.e., assumes 1, if ηt−l < 0, or 0, if otherwise, ηt−l ≥ 0. If
γ1 = ... = γq = 0, it implies that the shocks impact curve is symmetric, i.e., past positive and negative shocks
equally impact current volatility. Thus, the null hypothesis of no leverage effect is easy to test in the GJR
functional form. Following Baur and Dimpﬂ (2018), the asymmetric speciﬁcation adopted by both functional
forms, also allows volatility to respond more quickly to positive returns. It eliminates the possible consequence
of the leverage effect, i.e., an unexpected BTC price drop increases volatility more than an analogous unexpected
price increase.

3.2 Impulse response function simulations

This paper also uses BTC conditional volatility, the conditional quasi-correlations and the estimated residuals
as inputs on a vector autoregressive framework (Sims, 1980) to simulate the impulse responses’ shocks. Thus,
from an adaptation of Jurado et al (2015) and Scotti (2016), shocks coming from risk and uncertainty measures
were simulated to understand how the selected drivers affects the BTC returns. The unrestricted VAR model is
described in its simplest form in terms of lagged variables:

(12)
where Φl for l = 1,2, ..., p is a matrix k× k of the BTC covariate parameters, and εit is the vector of errors i.i.d.
Hence, this term is used to simulate the shocks through impulse response functions (IRFs).

4 Data sample design and processing

The used data were obtained from Datastream and covers the period from September 13, 2011, to June 19,
2018. The daily logarithmic returns of global ﬁnancial indexes’ total sample has 2,472 interpolated observations
of BTC, S&P500, SSEC and XAU. The S&P500 representing the US stock market index reﬂects potential
startups that could develop new technologies from blockchain. This indicator is composed of 500 large companies
listed on the NYSE/NASDAQ that together represent approximately 80% of US market capitalization. China’s
main stock index (SSEC Composite Index) represents Asia, identiﬁed as the global leader in BTC trading
services since 2015-16, hosting over half of total transactions (Fanusie and Robinson, 2018). They justiﬁes that
the SSEC has performed a role similar to that of the S&P500 in BTC price formation.

Similar to mineral-type commodities, the BTC price depends on the miners’ marginal costs (Selgin, 2015).
Thus, considering this synthetic money aspect of BTC, the price of gold (XAU) was also used to track the
multivariate volatility. Figure 3 and Figure 4 in the Appendix A exhibits the trajectories of BTC (USD$/BTC)
and the logarithmic returns of the selected variables. To test structural changes in BTC returns the Chow test,
developed by (Chow, 1960), was used to control the results.

5 Empirical ﬁndings

The results of Chow tests performed are in Table 4 in the Appendix A. They reveal that the hack attack against
Bitﬁnex was statistically signiﬁcant and initiate a new regime for BTC returns. Thus, it was set the regime 1 for
the period of September 13, 2011, to July 7th, 2016, with 1,783 observations. The regime 2 refers to the period
from August 8, 2016, to June 19, 2018, with 680 observations. Moreover, the descriptive statistics regards the
used variables are illustrated in Table 1. The columns at right corresponds to the Augmented Dickey-Fuller
(ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests.

All returns are stationary, since the null hypothesis is rejected at 1% for ADF and PP and not rejected for
the KPSS test. The maximum daily return of BTC was 36.14%, which occurred on 16 April 2013, while its
minimum was -31.09% observed on 18 August 2012. The sample revealed skewness and kurtosis, with attention
to SSEC data. Excess kurtosis postulates platykurtic series, which are commonly present in ﬁnancial time
series. This strengths the argument for selecting a model capable of measuring volatilities from a multivariate
perspective, in opposite to univariate analysis. Several models with different estimators and speciﬁcations were
tested, including a set of functional forms ARFIMA (p,d,q) for testing long memory volatility (Peng et al, 2018;
Zargar and Kumar, 2018, 2019), but results suggested no improvements.

Following Ardia et al (2018), the stochastic processes also pointed for two different regimes better described
by the ARMA (2,1) EGARCH (1,1) (regime 1) and ARMA (1,1) GJR-GARCH (2,1) (regime 2), respectively. It
was conﬁrmed by the log-likelihood and the serial correlation (ARCH test) for both regimes. The null hypothesis
is no ARCH, which was rejected according to Table 5 in Appendix A. The estimation of the MGARCH model
follows two steps. First, the univariate EGARCH and GJR-GARCH are estimated for each of four variables.

7

Second, the multivariate model and proceed to the diagnosis tests were performed. The best ﬁt for both of the
regimes was using the estimator developed in Tse and Tsui (2002). This estimator considers a constant in the
variance parameter (Constσ2) for the second regime, which does not depend on time t and was signiﬁcative at a
95% conﬁdence level.

The results of the univariate estimations are summarized in Table 6 in Appendix A. The parameter α is
from ARCH model, while βi are GARCH parameters, θi are EGARCH parameters, and γ is the GJR parameter
speciﬁcation, respectively. They presented strong convergence, i.e., the estimators are asymptotically consistent.
The sampled mean of squared residuals was used to start recursion, and these were obtained through the sandwich
formula, i.e., robust standard errors. This univariate model estimate that a volatility innovation in response to
εt−1 increases, indicated by the negative parameter α for regime 1, while it diminish as consequence of the
positive parameter α for regime 2.

The parameter β, for instance, illustrates high volatility for regime 1 (close to unity), while for regime 2
β2 > β1 indicates that volatility is falling over time. Positive shocks in long run BTC return volatility increases
it by more than negative shocks for regime 1. Similar to Baur and Dimpﬂ (2018), this is illustrated by the
asymmetry parameter θ2, which is different from zero at a 99% conﬁdence level. The asymmetry parameter
γ for regime 2 is not different from zero at a 99% conﬁdence level. Table 2 summarizes the results of the
DCC-MGARCH, considering regimes 1 and 2, respectively:

The parameters ρi j reveal the quasi-correlation described in Equation 7. By assuming BTC=1, S&P500=2,
SSEC=3 and XAU=4, the parameters for regime 1 were ρ21 = 0.02408, ρ31 = −0.23239, and ρ41 = −0.19233,
while for regime 2, they were ρ21 = −0.00752, ρ31 = −0.03266, and ρ41 = 0.01797, respectively. The estimated
parameters underlines that the degree of interdependence between BTC return volatility was evidenced in regime
1, where all quasi-correlation parameters were statistically signiﬁcant at a 99% conﬁdence level. However, it
changes dramatically for the very recent regime (regime 2), where only SSEC was statistically signiﬁcant at a
90% conﬁdence level. Other changes in relation to regime 1 were observed, as the parameters α and β, which
become not statistically signiﬁcant for the second one.

Such outcomes indicates that the effects of shocks on BTC return volatility at time t when the shock occurs,
and volatility’s persistence, are only signiﬁcative for the ﬁrst regime. Moreover, the estimations are also in line
with Ciaian et al (2016) for regime 2, since they did not reveal signiﬁcant conditional variance parameters for
any of the selected variables. Similar to Klein et al (2018), the estimated dynamic conditional correlation of
BTC for regime 1 presented a positive signal for the S&P500 and a negative signal for the SSEC and the XAU.
The parameters for regime 2 seem to emphasize that BTC volatility follows a less interdependent trajectory,
mainly characterized by heavy uncertainty around BTC events. Table 3 exhibits the results of the best ﬁt for
both of regimes:

The goodness-of-ﬁt criteria were based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Schwartz Bayesian
Criterion (SBC), and the Shibata and Hannan-Quinn (HQ). The less the values of these statistics are, the better
the model ﬁts the data. Table 7 and Table 8 in Appendix A exhibit the normality tests and the autocorrelation
tests on the returns’ residuals and the squares of the returns’ residuals, respectively. Thereafter, autocorrelation
tests (Q statistic) of the returns’ residuals and squared returns’ residuals were performed. They suggested that
the models completely corrected residual autocorrelation. Figure 1 shows the DCC-MGARCH estimations for
BTC conditional variance, conditional covariances and correlation for S&P500, SSEC and XAU.

Great volatility cluster for the conditional variance of BTC during mid-2012 to 2013 was observed for
regime 1. In addition, the conditional covariances suggests a positive-to-negative relation of BTC with the
S&P500, while the opposite is observed regarding the SSEC and XAU. The quasi-correlations reveal a similar

9

positive-to-negative relation with S&P500 and negative-to-positive relations with SSEC and XAU. Regime 2
indicates completely distinct trajectories, with various conditional volatility clusters since mid-2017 to mid-2018.
The conditional covariances point to a negative relation between the BTC and the S&P500 and SSEC and
a positive relation with XAU. This regime is also characterized by high volatility of all series, mainly the
quasi-correlations. They presented as negative for the S&P500 and positive for SSEC and XAU.

There is still no information about how the BTC returns are affected by other shocks beyond information
provided by the GARCH-type models. Hence, it was used unrestricted VAR framework to estimate IRFs, which
consists of positive orthogonal shocks of 3% on the term εit from Equation 12. For this purpose, the conditional
variances and the estimated residuals obtained in step 3 were used. It was consider predictions 30 days ahead for
BTC, SP&500, SSEC and XAU on the BTC returns. The IRFs are illustrated in Figure 2:

SSEC and XAU risks and uncertainty on BTC returns

On the top part of the ﬁgure are the estimated responses for ﬁrst regime, and below these are the estimated
responses for regime 2. The estimated responses to risks represent the shocks of the conditional variances of each
variable. Uncertainty consists of shocks coming from sources that were not explained by the GARCH-types of
models. The estimated residuals from step 3 were used as proxies for this purpose. All shocks have instantaneous,
short and transitory effects on BTC returns, whose predictions are indicate on the horizontal axis. All shocks
coming from risk presented as being approximately -2% on BTC returns for regime 1, while for regime 2, they
are positive for BTC (2.2%), SSEC (5%) and XAU (4.3%) and negative for S&P500 (-3.5%).

Shocks coming from uncertainty point to oscillatory effects from BTC for regime 1; positive from the
S&P500 (2.3%) and XAU (4%) and not statistically signiﬁcant from the SSEC (-3.0%). This paper found
empirical evidence based on univariate approaches that asymmetry parameter for regime 2 was not statistically
signiﬁcant, and that volatility is falling over time. However, according to VAR, they were negative for BTC
(-3%) and not statistically signiﬁcant for other sources. The outcomes also suggests that the highest effect among
estimated shocks comes from BTC uncertainty. The volatility tends to rise in response to negative news for BTC

10

prices, making excess returns lower than expected. Otherwise, volatility tends to fall in response to good news,
making excess returns higher than expected, i.e., a negative correlation between BTC returns and changes in
return volatility.

It was difﬁcult to ﬁt any covariates to predict BTC returns and to ﬁnd evidence to support any quasi-
correlation. In addition, the most relevant cluster of volatility found aftermath from May 19, 2015, indicates a
regime changing in BTC returns. The IRFs also register an instantaneous, strong and transitory effect coming
from BTC uncertainty, also in line with the evidence found in White (2015), Urquhart (2017), Corbet et al
(2018b) and Li et al (2015). This makes uncertainty coming from own BTC price formation important to
explain its returns, while other sources of shocks were statistically nonsigniﬁcant. While in regime 1 BTC return
volatility is also explain by ﬁnancial global indicators, in regime 2 such volatility mainly depends on its own
market microstructure.

Moreover, distinct from other assets, BTC return is affected depending on how such technology is consumed.
Combined, the increasing demand for anonymity in the international ﬁnancial system and derivatives collateral-
ization issued by CME, CBOE and LedgerX, could had accelerated BTC speculation in short-term, while has
potential to split volatility in long-term, as found by Baur and Dimpﬂ (2019). BTC prices appreciated more than
thirty times in sixteen months from US$604.10 (August 5th, 2016) to US$19,187.00 (December 14th, 2017).
According to multivariate analysis, there is clear signals of a BTC speculative bubble from the end of 2017 to
mid-2018. All uncertainty distancing BTC prices from the forces that affect an ordinary asset’s fundamental
aspects, such as earnings per share, the discounted present value and expectations about the future.

6 Summary and conclusions

Fintechs reﬂect macroeconomic changes by allowing to individuals to access fully transparent ﬁnancial
services governed by open source algorithms. One of the main advantages of this distinct ecosystem is to create
incentives for those who maintain and check all of the information in the network. Blockchain as ﬁnancial
innovation and new type of decentralized, globally distributed and competitive network allows startups to
collaborate without permission from other network users. Nonetheless, the success of BTC as well as of other
ﬁntechs depends, in turn, on which effect will prevail in terms of their utilization in businesses: that from the
underground economy or that from the aboveground economy.

However, government announcements, rumors, hack attacks, etc., may turn out to be a distraction and
generates more uncertainty and speculative market behavior concerning a still under-developed system. On
the other hand, if the regulatory frameworks of countries do not follow the evolution of cryptocurrency and
create the appropriate economic incentives, BTC and other ﬁntechs will become largely worthless. To better
understand how the threats against this new ecosystem materialize into volatility and uncertainty, some empirical
evidence provided indicates that BTC returns appear to follow two regimes.

BTC return volatility was estimated using dynamic conditional heteroskedasticity models, and the outcomes
of quasi-correlations and quasi-covariances between volatilities demonstrated high volatility, subject to uncer-
tainty shocks, mainly from the end of 2017 to mid-2018. Meanwhile, this information technology framework
with publicly available usage data does not require oversight by any monetary authority. Since these algorithms
could be permanently and continuously audited, this characteristic should be better explored to reduce its return
volatility.

These last events could toward possible equilibrium: If the CME and CBOE, in addition to LedgerX, fully
collateralize their operations, then a number of startups will be able to bring institutional investments without
increasing volatility. Competition among altcoins could lead to hybrid monetary arrangements with private and
government monies issuers. Thus, this paper propose investigations on algorithm regulation, their costs and
beneﬁts. Thereby, it also could help to decrease the risk and uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency.
