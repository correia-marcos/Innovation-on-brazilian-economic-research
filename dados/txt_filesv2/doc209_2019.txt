ABSTRACT 

We provide evidence on the effect of changes in economic conditions on the health outcomes at birth and 
infant mortality condition of cohorts born between 1998 and 2014 in Colombia. Our approach exploits the 
2000s  international  gold  prices  surge  as  a  natural  experiment  generating  exogenous  shocks  to  local 
economies.  The  results  indicate  that  higher  gold  prices  are  associated  with  gains  in  metrics  of  infant 
health,  including  birth  weight,  gestation,  and  infant  mortality  in  municipalities  producing  more  gold. 
Investigating  mechanisms,  we  find  that  (1)  the  price  shock  increased  fertility  for  less-educated  mothers 
and  decreased  the  number  of  prenatal  visits  (time-intensive  activity),  and  (2)  the  shock  had  significant 
positive effects on the labor participation of mothers. Taken together, we highlight that the income effect 
is more important than any other opposite effect on the production of healthy children.

RESUMO  
O  presente  estudo  estima  o  efeito  de  mudanças  nas  condições  econômicas  sobre  a  saúde  ao  nascer  e 
condição de mortalidade infantil de cortes nascidas entre 1998 e 2014 na Colômbia. Este artigo explora o 
aumento  dos  preços  internacionais  do  ouro  dos  anos  2000  como  um  experimento  natural  que  gera 
choques  exógenos  para  as  economias  locais.  Os  resultados  indicam  que  maiores  preços  do  ouro  são 
associados  com  ganhos  em  medidas  de  saúde  infantil  tais  como  peso  ao  nascer,  período  de  gestação  e 
mortalidade  infantil  em  municípios  que  produzem  com  maior  intensidade  o  ouro.    Investigando  os 
mecanismos, encontra-se (1) um efeito positivo sobre a decisão de fertilidade das mães menos educadas e 
um  efeito negativo sobre o número de visitas pré-natais (intensivas em  tempo), e (2) o choque teve um 
efeito significativo e positivo sobre a participação no mercado laboral da mãe. No geral, destaca-se que o 
efeito renda é mais importante do que qualquer outro efeito oposto na procriação de crianças saudáveis.

1.  Introduction  
 

The  effect  of  natural  resource  abundance  on  economic  development  in  producer  economies  has 
stirred  a  heated  debate1.  The  existing  empirical  literature  suggests  that  abundance  of  natural  resources, 
predominately in developing countries, is associated with negative outcomes as such corruption and rent-
seeking,  neglect  of  education,  conflicts  and  environmental  damages,  which  have  a  direct  effect  on  the 
living  conditions  of  the  population  (GYLFASON,  2001  ;  VAN  DER  PLOEG,  2011).  Most  of  the 
evidence, however, capture the effects of resource abundance on development indicators using aggregate 
data  at  the  country  level,  which  offer  few  details  about  the  local  economic  effects  of  natural  resource 
price booms/ busts. 

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether natural resources can improve living conditions 
of  the  local  population.  For  this  purpose,  we  focus  on  exogenous  income  shocks  induced  by  the  2000s 
boom  in  international  gold  prices,  and  estimate  how  these  shocks  affected  the  health  outcomes  at  birth 
(such  as  birth  weight)  and  infant  mortality  condition  of  cohorts  born  between  1998  and  2014  in 
Colombia2,3. Furthermore, we try to explore how such boom affects parental behavior in both health and 
labor market participation as possible mechanisms through which these effects may play out. The focus 
on  infants  is  compelling  to  understand  the  short-run  health  effects  of  income  shocks  for  at  least  three 
reasons.  First,  governments  are  highly  motivated  to  protect  these  most  vulnerable  members  of  society. 
Second, it has been documented that a variety of prenatal shocks can lead to poor health at birth, which 
has long-lasting negative effects in health -as infant mortality- and consequently on economic capabilities 
(see,  for  example,  BARKER,  1995;  BEHRMAN  AND  ROSENZWEIG,  2004;  CASE  ET  AT.,  2005; 
ALMOND,  2006;  BLACK  ET  AL.,  2007;  BARRECA,  2010  ,  among  other)4.  Second,  analyzing  the 
infants'  health  outcomes  offers  us  a  link  of  cause  and  effect  cleaner  and  immediate  than  focusing  on 
adults' health status because adults’ diseases today may reflect exposures to other health shocks, such as 
pollution, that occurred during the course of their lives (CURRIE;NEIDELL, 2005). 

The  theoretical  implications  of  the  effects  of  economic  shocks  on  child  health  are  ambiguous 
because  changes  in  labor  earnings  have  both  income  and  substitution  effects.  On  the  one  hand,  higher 
wages may increase the opportunity cost of carrying out time-intensive activities. This may provide less 
incentives to allocate time devoted to children health production5. This is the substitution effect.  On the 
other  one,  higher  wages  allow  households  to  increase  the  expenditures  on  maternal  and  fetal  related 
health items. This is the income effect.  

Additionally,  gold  mining  are  associated  to  environmental  damage  (e.g.,  release  of  heavy  metal 
pollution  and  deforestation,  among  other  effects)  and  conflicts  which  could  affect  human  health6.  In 
Colombia  context,  commodity  booms  or  busts  can  affect  the  levels  of  violence  in  mining  producing 
regions. Dube and Vargas (2013) find a positive relationship between natural resource price shocks and 

                                                           
1  See,  for  instance,  Allcott  and  Keniston,(2017);  Sachs  e  Warner,  (1999);Sachs  e  Warner,  (2001)  and  Mehlum,  Moene  and  
Torvik, (2006), among others. 
2 We take advantage of the persistence of the shock, which we can assume is exogenous due to two factors: (i) Colombia has 
no market power to influence international gold prices (Colombia ranks 21th in gold production worldwide) and (ii) gold 
mines are randomly distributed among municipalities by natural factors. 
3 The gold production is distributed around the country,  with about 20% of  municipalities (analogous to counties in the US) 
showing geological prospects and mining activities occurring in at least 12 of Colombia’s 32 departments (analogous to states). 
For one department, Chocó, the gold represents more than 5% of GDP. In relation to Colombian exports, the gold, which is a 
non-traditional export, equaled in value to traditional exports such as ferronickel and coffee  (Ministry of Mines and Energy, 
2010). 
4The proposition that health conditions at birth have a lasting impact on adult life achievements comes from the so-called “fetal 
origins hypothesis”. The first premise originated with David Barker in the 1980s. See Barker (2001) and Almond and Currie 
(2011) for a review of the epidemiological evidence in support of this hypothesis.  
5For  example,  activities  as  practicing  good  hygiene  and  traveling  to  distant  facilities  for  free  preventive  and  primary  health 
service require time to be performed. 
6 It is estimated that approximately 100 tons per year of mercury are released by artisanal mining, which makes Colombia the 
world's highest per capita mercury polluter (Cordy et al.,2011; Telmer and Veiga 2008). 

 

violence  (measured  by  the  No.  annual  non-state  armed  groups  attack,  clashes  and  casualties,  among 
other). This fact can have effects on health indicators at birth. In fact, according to Camacho (2008) the 
exposition  to  random  landmine  explosions  during  a  woman’s  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  is  robustly 
correlated with lower birth weight. Camacho (2008) explains this impact through the relationship between 
stress in the early stages of pregnancy and outcomes at birth. In our study, unfortunately, we do not have 
information in our database that allows us to separately identify each of the previously mentioned effects. 
Therefore, taking advantage of the fact that these effects work in opposite directions, we estimate the net 
effect of their combined influence. Thus, our research offers evidence about relative importance of time, 
environmental  degradation  and  stress  versus  current  income  in  the  production  of  healthy  children. 
Because credit constrains and other market imperfections are more common in developing countries, we 
expect  that  our  results to  be  consistent  with  growing  evidence  that  the  income  effect  is  more  important 
other  effects  to  produce  healthy  children  (see  for  example,  BURLANDO,  2014;  BOZZOLI  AND 
QUINTANA-DOMEQUE, 2014 )7. 

In our empirical analysis, we use a difference-in-differences model which compares infant health 
indicators  across  municipalities  whose  local  economies  have  different  degrees  of  dependence  to  gold 
production.  Specifically,  our  empirical  strategy  exploits  the  interaction  between  the  exogenous 
international  commodity  price  with  the  amount  of  the  commodity  produced  in  each  municipality.  As 
metrics of infant  health  we use   infant  mortality(probability of dying  with  less than one  year) and  birth 
weight (and other indicators such as preterm, extreme preterm and Apgar (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, 
Activity and Respiration)) 8,9We use birth weight because it is determined by fetal growth rate at a given 
gestation length, which in turn is largely influenced by nutrition (Kramer, 1987) 10. This feature makes it 
an attractive measure for the study of the effects of historical events that altered the in utero environment 
on health at birth11.  

The  results  of  our  analysis  provide  evidence  that  the  2000s  boom  in  international  gold  prices 
generated a positive impact on infant health outcomes in general. More specifically, we find a reduction 
both in the cases of low and very low birth weight (LBW and VLBW) and in infant mortality rates per 
thousand  live  births,  with  price  increases  inducing  an  improvement  in  child  health  conditions  among 
municipalities  whose  economies  rely  heavily  on  gold  production12.  Sensitivity  analyses  show  that  the 
coefficients  do  not  suffer  large  changes  whether  controls  or  fixed  effects  are  included  or  excluded. 
Investigating  mechanisms,  we  find  that  (1)  the  price  shock  increased  fertility  for  less-educated  mothers 
and  decreased  the  number  of  prenatal  visits  (time-intensive  activity),  and  (2)  the  shock  had  significant 
positive effects on the labor participation of mothers. These pieces of evidence suggest that health-related 
benefits  associated  to  the  income  effect  during  this  booming  period  prevail  over  the  potential  negative 
impacts  represented  by  the  substitution  effect  and  the  negative  environmental  externalities  from  the 
increasing mining production. 

Our findings are in line with Aragón and Rud (2013), who highlight the dominance of the income 
effect in the case of the Peruvian economy. They studied the effect of the expansion of the largest gold 
mine  in  Peru  on  local  living  standards  using  households’  survey  data  for  the  period  1997  to  2006.  The 

                                                           
7 Constraints on savings and borrowing weigh not only on households’ consumption smoothing but also on their ability to pay 
for basic investments in their children. 
8 Apgar score is a composite index of a child’s health at the first and fifth minute of birth. It takes into account factors: activity 
and muscle tone, heart rate, grimace, skin coloration, and respiration. Each of this factors are worth 2 points. 
9 we classify each child according to his/her birth weight in low birth weight (LBW), which are those born with a weight less 
than or equal to 2500 grams, and very low birth weight (VLBW) that are children with a birth weight of 1500 grams or less. 
10Medical  literature  has  established  a  strong  link  between  low  birth  weight  and  health  problems  such  as  cerebral  palsy, 
deafness,  epilepsy,  blindness,  asthma,  and  lung  disease  (BROOKS  et  al.,  2001;  KAELBER;  PUGH,  1969;  LUCAS; 
MORLEY; COLE, 1998; MATTE et al., 2001; NELSON; GRETHER, 1997; PANETH, 1995). Low birth weight has been also 
shown to be a strong predictor of impaired development of the brain. Children born with very low birth weight are more likely 
to suffer from attention deficit, dyspraxia, and impaired learning (MARLOW et al, 1989; 1993). 
11 In this point, what becomes relevant is to understand the malleability of health at birth. Today it is not difficult  to think that 
the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drug cause intrauterine  growth retardation, or that good nutrition and better 
access to medical care have positive effects on fetal health (Currie, 2011). 
12 These same results are found when we use the number of weeks of gestation and APGAR score. 

authors  found  that  the  expansion  of  the  mine  has  a  positive  impact  on  nominal  and  real  income  of  the 
local population. They argue that a possible channel of transmission through which these effects emerge 
is the existence of backward linkages. To try to verify whether this is true for the case of Colombia, we 
present an exploratory analysis of the relationship between the proportion of mothers with a contributory 
regime  and  the  boom  in  gold  world  price.  This  type  of  social  protection,  according  to  the  Colombia’ 
Ministry of Health, is mandatory for formal workers and other people with the capacity to pay. While the 
other  regime,  subsidized,  is  for  the  unemployed,  informal  sector  workers  and  the  poor.  Therefore, 
knowing if the mother is affiliated or not to the contributory regime is a good proxy to have information 
about  their  labor  participation.  We  find  a  positive  relationship  between  these  two  variables  which 
suggests  that  the  gold  boom  generated  a  positive  effect  on  mothers’  labor  participation.  This  result 
reinforces the idea that the income effect is greater in magnitude than any other opposite effect. 

Our  study  makes  a  few  contributions  to  literature  examining  the  effects  of  economic  shocks  on 
children health. First, although there is a rich theoretical literature that suggest that countries and regions 
with an abundance of natural resources fail to provide better standards of living(Sachs and Warner, 1999; 
Mehlum  et  al,  2006,  among  others),  our  results  show,  at  least  in  the  short  term,  the  gold  boom  had  a 
positive impact on the living standards of the local population and improved the children health. Second, 
we  see  our  empirical  work  as  a  first  attempt  to  examine  the  effects  of  the  abundance  of  gold  within  a 
country on birth outcomes of the cohorts affected by the gold boom. This is a contribution to a literature 
that emphasizes the long-lasting effects of the fetal exposure to economic shocks or health insults on an 
individual’s  economic  well-being  (see,  for  example,  Almond,  2006;  Oreopoulos  et  al.,  2008;  Barreca, 
2010).  Third, as  will  be  seen  later,  our  work  also  contributes  to  literature  on  fertility.  Specifically,  our 
empirical  evidence  that  the  gold  boom  led  to  increases  to  fertility  for  disadvantaged  women  (low-
educated  women)  is  consistent  with  life-cycle  models  in  which  credit  constraints  and  skill  depreciation 
during pregnancy are important in fertility decisions.  

Finally,  we  also  highlight  the  importance  of  prenatal  interventions  as  a  mechanism  to  reduce 
disparities in the accumulation of human capital in the long-run. This is of particular interest in view of 
the growing evidence indicating that interventions focused on the prenatal period are more effective and 
substantially less expensive to be implemented (Doyle  et al.,  2009). This is especially important in the 
context of Colombia because current policies are focused on the population over six years old. 

The  remainder  of  this  paper  proceeds  as  follows.  Section  2  theoretical  framework.  Section  3 
describes our micro data and the identification strategies. Section 4 contains our main results. In Section 
5,  we  present  some  robustness  check.  Section  6  provides  a  possible  exploring  market  channel  through 
which the gold boom impacts birth weight. Finally, section 7 presents conclusions. 

2.  Theoretical framework 

        Grossman and Joyce (1988) and Rosenzweig e Schultz (1982) are two seminal papers that presented 
the concept of infant health production functions. Under this framework, infant health is assumed to be a 
function of several factors. First, baseline health status. Second, the time spent on activities that increase 
health (exercise, cooking, sleeping, time to go to visits to the doctor, among others). Third, health related 
goods (e.g. healthy food).  

Following  Rosenzweig  e  Schultz  (1982),  we  assume  that  parents  maximize  the  following 

 
intertemporal utility function: 

                                  𝑈 = 𝑈(𝑋, 𝑌, 𝐻)                                                               (1) 

This equation indicates that a family gets utility from three types of goods: H the health of each of 
 
its children (or child in utero); (Y) goods that do affect infant (growth of the fetus) and/or maternal health 
(e.g.  medicines, vaccines and food), and X which are health-neutral (have no effect on H, such as books).  
 

The child health production function is given by 

                                  𝐻 = 𝑓(𝑌, 𝑍, 𝜇), 𝐹𝑦, 𝐹𝑧, 𝐹𝜇   ≠ 0                                         (2) 

where  Z  is  the  purchased  market  inputs  such  as  medical  services  (general  medical  care  during 
pregnancy or particular prenatal care procedures/advices), which affect U through their effects on H. 𝜇 is 
the component of child (fetal) health due to genetic or environmental conditions uninfluenced by parental 

The  problem  facing  the  family  is:  To  maximize  (1)  given  (2)  subject  to  the  budget  constraint, 

behavior and preferences. The child health production function has the property that it is imbedded in the 
constrained utility maximization behavior of the family.

where I is exogenous income and 𝑃𝑥, 𝑃𝑦 and 𝑃𝑧  are, respectively, the prices of the health-neutral 
 
good,  X,  health-related  consumer  good,  Y,    child  health  investment  goods.  Expressions  (1)–  (3)  can  be 
manipulated to yield health input demand functions of the form    
                                                      𝑋 =   𝐷𝑥(𝑃𝑥, 𝑃𝑦, 𝑃𝑧 , 𝐼, 𝜇)                                                       (4) 

                                                      𝑌 =   𝐷𝑦(𝑃𝑥, 𝑃𝑦, 𝑃𝑧 , 𝐼, 𝜇)                                                       (5) 

                                                      𝑍 =   𝐷𝑧(𝑃𝑥, 𝑃𝑦, 𝑃𝑧 , 𝐼, 𝜇)                                                        (6)                  

The effects of changes in the prices of the three types of goods on the level of child health can be 

  
derived from these equations, noting that 
                                                     𝑑𝐻 =   𝐹𝑦𝑑𝑌 +   𝐹𝑧𝑑𝑍 +   𝐹𝜇𝑑𝜇                                               (7) 
From (2), these effects can be written as:

where 

𝑑𝜇
𝑑𝑃𝑖

 = 0, for i= x,y,z . Expressions (8), (9), and (10) indicate that price effects on child health 

depend on the effects of changes in prices on the demand for health production inputs as well as on the 
marginal products of these inputs in the production of health. In (10), if  𝐹𝑦 >0 (goods that benefit health) 
and since Z considers intensive inputs in time, a reduction in wages would increase the demand for Z and 

decrease  the  demand  for  Y  (

𝑑𝑌
𝑑𝑃𝑧

  <  0)  leading  to  an  ambiguous  effect  on  child’s  health.  Therefore,  the 

existence of credit constraints and other market imperfections, which lead families to make an incomplete 
consumption smoothing, make health vulnerable to negative economic shocks (income effect greater than 
effect substitution). 
 
Now an expansion of government expenditure would affect health and health behavior through the 
demand  equation  (4)  -(6).  Suppose  an  increase  in  public  spending  is  reflected  in  the  creation  of  more 
social  programs.  Thus,  such  programs  may  reduce  the  prices  of  the  health  inputs,  through  direct 
subsidization, or indirectly by increasing access. In the latter case, making services or inputs more readily 
available, i.e., by placing services in a remote area, reduce the time or travel costs to use the service. In 
addition, public programs may provide information on how to produce health more efficiently. This might 
include information on new inputs or on efficient practices with conventional inputs - when to breastfeed, 
how to sterilize baby formula, etc. - which yield greater survival rates for given total expenditures. 
 
3. Data and Identification strategy 

3.1 Data  

3.1.1 Vital Statistics Records 

The  main  source  of  data  for  this  study  is  the  vital  statistics  of  Colombia,  Estadísticas  Vitales  – 
EEVV-,  collected  by  the  Administrative  Department  of  Statistics  (DANE),  which  records  births  and 
deaths  of  children  under  one  year  of  age.  For  births,  the  Dane  registered  them  since  1998,  and  infant 
deaths since 1979. The data recorded in the birth certificates not only register the health status of newborn 
and the exact date of birth, but also contain information on the characteristics of the parents including age, 

marital status and education, type of insurance. In addition to this information, the birth certificate allows 
us to observe the behavior of the mother during pregnancy, as it contains details about prenatal care. We 
obtained  data  from  1998  to  2014  for  the  1120  municipalities  in  Colombia,  which  corresponds- 
approximately  to  11  million  birth  records13.  Likewise,  the  death  certificates  from  the  DANE  provide 
comprehensive  information  on  date  and  cause  of  death,  birthdate,  race,  and  gender,  and  mother’s 
characteristics (education, marital status  and age) are also provided for individuals  who were under one 
year  of  life  at  death.  This  certificate  covers  over  96  percent  of  all  annual  deaths  inferred  from 
demographic census.  

The  Table  1  presents  basic  descriptive  statistics  from  theses  certificates.  On  the  one  hand,  the 
prevalence of LBW in Colombia is on the order of 6.28%. Almost 0.58% of infants had  VLBW. About 
13% of the births in the analysis period had a weight above 3500 gr. The average of 5 minute Apgar score 
is  5.99.  Of  all  infants  born  51.28%  were  male.  As  for  preterm  deliveries,  13.11%  of  babies  were  born 
before week 37 and 0.23% of them were born before week 28. Regarding the characteristics of mothers, 
approximately  40.70%  of  them  had  a  primary  education  level  or  less  (<5  years  of  schooling).  Also, 
25.63%  of  mothers  are  under  19  years  of  age,  19.21%  were  married.  Finally,  the  average  number  of 
prenatal visits is around 5 visits. At least 50.85% of mothers in our sample had 5 or fewer prenatal visits. 
On the other hand, the infant mortality rate per thousand births for the analysis period is 23.28 deaths on 
average. 
3.1.2 International gold price  

We use the World Bank’s commodities prices series, which offers monthly price information for 
different commodities (such as coffee, oil and coal, to name but a few) from 1960 to the present. Figure 1 
shows the evolution of average annual of gold world prices for the period 1900 to 2014. We can observe 
that the trend of prices  was approximately stable between 1990  and 2001 and it increased continuously 
from 2002 to 2012. This trend provides us a natural experiment from which we can analyze the effect of 
gold mining on birth outcomes. We use the average of the natural log of the international gold price in the 
12 months prior to birth in year y and month t for the construction of our main independent variable.  
3.1.3 Local gold production 
   
We  use  gold  production  data  provided  by  Dube  and  Vargas  (2013)  .  This  dataset  includes 
information on other commodities, such as coffee, oil and coal. This information is useful not only for the 
analysis of gold boom, but also to make a series of robustness checks, which will support our empirical 
result. Figure 2 and 3 show the cross-sectional variation of gold production in 2004 across different areas 
of  Colombia.  In  Figure  2,  we  can  observe  that  the  distribution  of  production  varies  substantially  across 
the municipalities that are at  or above  the 75th  percentile.  In this part of  the distribution, the maximum 
production  was  34.11  thousand  grams,  which  was  33.56  thousand  grams  greater  than  the  production  of 
the  municipality  that  produced  the  least  (0.54  thousand  grams).  Additionally,  the  standard  deviation  in 
gold production across of these municipalities is around 10 thousand grams.  As will be seen in the next 
section, this variation is essential for our empirical strategy. 

 

3.2 Estimation strategy  
 

The estimation of the causal  effect  of income  variations on  infant  health  raise some endogeneity 
issues, since some determinants of health are unobservable to the econometrician. A family's unobserved 
characteristics,  for  instance,  might  be  correlated  with  family  income  as  well  as  with  health-related 
expenditures. This situation could lead to a classic case of failed inference. To avoid these identification 
problems, it is necessary to find an exogenous source of income variation. In the absence of a randomized 
controlled  trial  (for  example,  to  assign  randomly  individuals  different  levels  of  permanent  income),  we 
exploit the 2000s boom in international gold prices as a natural experiment generating exogenous shocks 
                                                           
13 An advantage of this data is that weight, length, Apgar score, and gestation time recorded at the time of the delivery in the 
hospital  should  be  accurately  measured  variables.  The  sample  is  limited  to  births  that  were  certified  by  a  physician,  which 
implies  a  reduction  of  about  6%  in  the  number  of  observations.    We  have  also  disconsidered  births  that  occurred  in 
municipalities  in  which  we  have  no  information  on  the  levels  of  production  of  gold.  Thus,  the  final  sample  of  our  study 
consists of about 5,152,269 births. We aggregate the data into cells defined by municipality of residence of the mother, year  
and months of birth, and gender of the baby. 

to  local  economies.  This  variable  is  a  proxy  to  measure  the  gold  boom  in  each  municipality.  The 
assumption here is that variations in the world gold prices are exogenous to local conditions in producing 
municipalities in Colombia. This assumption is not unrealistic since Colombia is not among the main gold 
producers in the world and therefore the country may be considered a price taker in the international gold 
market (Colombia ranks 21th in gold production worldwide). 

One  should  note  that  the  world  price  of  gold  is  invariant  across  regions.  This  invariance  would 
leave  the  analysis  without  an  adequate  control  group  to  measure  the  effect  on  birth  outcomes,  since  all 
municipalities  would  be  exposed  to  the  same  price  variation.  Our  empirical  strategy  exploits  the 
interaction between global gold prices and municipality gold production capabilities as treatment variable. 
Because the mother’s nutritional status at the time of conception could also be an important predictor of 
child’s initial health endowment, we use the average of gold prices in the 12-month period before birth to 
take  into  account  that  effect  pre-pregnancy.  Accordingly,  to  all  the  above  considerations,  we  employ  a 
difference-in-differences  design  to  estimate  the  effects  of  the  boom  in  the  gold  prices  on  infant  health 
outcomes. We define non-producing municipalities as those with production equal to zero and producing 
municipalities as those with positive production. As previously seen, the level of gold production varies 
between  producing  municipalities.  Thus,  this  strategy  can  be  considered  as  a  difference  in  difference 
model with intensity in the treatment14. This analysis is based on a municipality-by month of birth panel. 
So, the benchmark regression is the following: 

 

𝐻𝑚𝑑𝑦𝑡 = 𝛼 +  𝛽(𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚𝑑 × 𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣,𝑡𝑦)+𝛿′𝑋𝑚𝑑𝑦𝑡+ 𝜂𝑚𝑡 + 𝛾𝑦𝑡 + 𝜂𝑑 × 𝑦 + 𝜖𝑚𝑑𝑦𝑡            (11)  

here  the  left-hand-side  variable,  𝐻𝑚𝑑𝑔𝑦𝑡  ,is  a measure  of  health  outcome  (average)  and  infant  mortality 
rate in the municipality m , department 𝑑, year y and month t (with t = 1, 2, …, 12). Our key dependent 
variables are LBW and VLBW and infant mortality rate per thousand births (IMR)9, but we also look at 
other  health  outcomes  such  as  length  of  gestation,  and  APGAR  score.  𝑋𝑚𝑑𝑦𝑡  is  a  vector  that  contains 
mother-specific  controls  such  as  age,  educational  attainment,  and  marital  status  (municipality  average). 
(𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚𝑑  is  the  gold  production  level  in  municipality  m  and    the  department  d  during  2004  and 
𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣,𝑡𝑦 denotes the average of the natural log of the international gold price in the 12 months prior to 
birth in year y and month t15for LBW and VLBW and 18 months before dying for infant mortality. 𝜂𝑚𝑡 is 
a  set  of  municipality-by-month  fixed  effects,  which  take  into  account  the  possibility  that  any  time-
invariant  differences  between  municipalities  (like  Geographical-Features)  may  be  correlated  with 
(𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚𝑑   ×   𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣,𝑡𝑦)and 𝐻𝑚𝑑𝑔𝑦𝑡.  

The  𝛾𝑦𝑡 is  a  set  of  year-by-month  fixed  effects,  which  captures  unobserved  aggregate  shocks 
impacting the entire country and secular trends in health outcomes. To address potential unobserved long-
run  differences  in  improving  public  health  and  other  socioeconomic  characteristics  across  department, 
department-specific linear time trends ( 𝜂𝑑 × 𝑦) are included in our benchmark specification. This linear 
time trend is common to all municipalities included in a given department (average of 38 municipalities 
per  department).  Further,  all  our  models  use  robust  standard  errors  adjusted  for  clustering  at  the 
municipality-month level to account for serial correlation (Bertrand et al.,  2004). We weight observations 
by the number of births, which has two purposes:  First,  it emulates  a regression at  the individual level. 
Second,  the  weighted  regression  may  control  for  the  fact  that  smaller  municipalities  can  generate  some 
noise  in  the  analysis  due  to  lower-quality  data  collection.  Thus,  variations  of  smaller  areas  are  given  a 
lower weight. 

Finally,  the  identifying  assumption  of  our statistical  approach  can  be  summarized  in  three  parts: 
First, the world price of gold is exogenous to local conditions in Colombian municipalities, i.e., it is not 
affected  by  Colombia’s  gold  production.  Second,  we  exploit  the  fact  that  this  natural  resource  is  not 
evenly distributed across the country (the distribution depend on natural factors), which produces a totally 

                                                           
14 This type of  methodology  has been  widely  used in recent studies ( See, for instant,  Dube and Vargas (2013), Miller and l 
(2010) and Acemoglu et al ( 2013)). 
15We measure prices in logs so we can assess its effects in percent terms.  The results are robust when prices are specified  in 
levels. 

random assignment of the effect of a boom or bust associated to  gold prices. Third, in the absence of a 
boom or bust in international  gold  price, municipalities in  the treatment and control groups would have 
experienced the same trends in the outcome of interest (𝐻𝑚𝑑𝑦𝑡). This assumption would be violated only 
if  there  were  differential  trends  in  time-varying  determinants  of  outcomes  across  treated  and  untreated 
areas.  For  example,  if  poorer  municipalities  were  converging  to  richer  ones  in  terms  of  income  or  any 
other potential determinant  of infant  health, then it may  lead to  overestimates of the effects  of the  gold 
boom on infant health. To provide an assessment on the validity of this assumption in our context, Figure 
4 shows the difference  in the temporal  trend in  the rate of newborns with low birth weight between the 
two types of municipalities (producer and non-producer)16. In this figure is observed that before 2004 the 
rate  of  children  with  LBW  evolved  relatively  similar  between  the  two  groups  and  only  after  that  year 
different  tendencies  were  visualized.  This  observation  would  give  meaning  to  the  application  of  our 
difference-in-differences setup.      

4.  Empirical results 
 
4.1 Main results 

Table  2  presents  the  main  empirical  results.  The  results  are  obtained  using  OLS  regression  of 
LBW, VLBW and IMR on our measure of prenatal gold shocks controlling for different regressors (from 
1998 to 2014). In our most basic specification presented in the first column, we regressed our child health 
measure on  a set  of  controls, which includes month-by-year, municipality  and  year fixed effects.  In the 
remaining  columns  we  add  to  the  firth  specification  other  control  variables  as  follows:  Column  2  with 
municipality-by-month  fixed  effects,  column  3  with  mothers’  characteristics  and  newborns’  sex,  and 
column 4 with department specific linear time trends.  

Overall, the coefficients in columns (1)– (5) seem to suggest that gold price shocks have a positive 
relationship  with  infant  health,  that  is  to  say:  when  international  gold  price  increases,  child  health 
improves differentially in municipalities that produce gold more intensively. In all the specifications the 
coefficient  of  interest  𝛽  suggest  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  the  incidence  of  LBW  and  IMR 
caused by exposure to gold boom . It is notable that our results are extremely robust across specifications, 
including  for  department-specific  linear  time  trends  and  mother's  characteristics.  To  understand  the 
magnitude  of  the  estimated,  consider  an  increase  in  PGoldav,ty  of  0.20  log  points  and  the  coefficient 
estimated  in  column  (4) and  (5).  For  the  average  gold  production  in  producing  municipalities,  which  is 
2.335  (hundred  thousand  grams),  the  coefficients  imply  that  the  increase  in  prices  induced  -0.02  less 
newborn babies with LBW, relative to the non-producing municipalities. Now when this effect is divided 
by  mean  of  LBW  rate,  the  resulting  effect  size  is  a  decrease  of  -0.30%  in  the  prevalence  of  LBW  in 
producing  municipalities  relative  to  non-producers.  We  labeled  in  this  and  subsequent  tables  as  ‘‘% 
Impact  ([coef*∆  log  price*    𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑̅̅̅̅̅̅]/mean)’’.  This  impact  is  greater  for  municipalities  with  production 
levels greater than 𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑̅̅̅̅̅̅. 

This effect estimated of -0.30% that we uncover for the boom in gold world price is almost three 
times smaller in absolute value than the -1.02% reduction in the cases of  LBW due to the introduction of 
the  Food  Stamp  Program  (FSP)  in  United  States  estimated  by  Almond,  Hoynes  and    Schanzenbach 
(2011). Moreover, our estimated impact  for  LBW is a little lower than  -0.50% reduction in  babies with 
LBW explained by a 1% increase in the unemployment rate in the US labor market (see DEHEJIA et al, 
2004).  Comparing  the  coefficient  found  in  our  work  (which  is  -0.04074)  in  relation  to  that  found  by 
Bozzoli  and  Quintana-Domeque  (2014)  for  the  Argentine  economic  collapse  is  0.026  lower  in  absolute 
value  than  the  -0.067  calculated  by  them.  These  comparisons  suggest  that  our  estimates  are  not  so  far 
from what has already been found in empirical studies analyzing economic shocks in the pregnancy stage. 
After finding that the gold boom led to a substantial decrease in the cases of LBW, we turn to the 
analysis  of  the  effects  of  the  gold  boom  on  infant  mortality.  Column  (5)  shows  that  gold  price  shocks 

                                                           
16 In this figure, we define as a non-producing municipality those with gold production equal to zero and producing 
municipalities as those with gold production in the 95th percentile or above it. 

have a negative relationship with IMR: when the price of gold increases, IMR decrease differentially in 
municipalities  that  produce  gold  more  intensively.  This  estimate  is  of  statistical  and  economic 
significance.  In  magnitude,  the  resulting  effect  size  is  a  decrease  of  -0.56%  in  the  IMR  in  Colombia’s 
gold producing areas relative to non-producers. Finally, we obtain similar results when applying the same 
estimation procedure for VLBW. Specifically, from column (1) through (4) in panel B of the Table 2, we 
observe a significantly negative coefficient of effect of the gold boom on the rate of VLBW. These results 
are also very robust to the addition of more control variables to the model. As in panel A, we calculate the 
impact, evaluated in the average gold municipality, in percentage terms of an increase of 0.20 log points 
in 𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣,𝑡𝑦,the resulting effect size is between -0.68 % and -0.71 % of reduction in cases of very low 
birth  weight  in  producing  municipalities  relative  to  non-producers.  In  general,  in  Table  2,  we  view  the 
specification with department specific linear time trends as very encouraging, because we have addressed 
a  potential  concern  regarding  the  possibility  of  that  our  estimator  is  driven  by  common  omitted  factors 
correlated both with 𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑚𝑑   ×   𝑃𝐺𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑎𝑣,𝑡𝑦 and health at birth. 

In  general,  our  estimates  unveil  a  clear  pattern:  they  show  a  positive  relationship  between  gold 
price  shocks  and  health,  with  price  increases  inducing  a  differential  improved  in  child  health  among 
municipalities that exploit more this natural resource.  

Taken together, this pattern of results seems  to  suggest that income shocks are a more powerful 
determinant  of  health  at  birth  than  the  joint  effect  of  the  opportunity  cost  of  time,  environmental 
degradation  and  stress  to  produce  healthy  children.  However,  due  to  the  level  of  aggregation  of  the 
analysis, we cannot rule out that the main result may be driven by changes in the composition of births, 
composition  of  parturients  (fertility  decisions)  and  the  health-related  behavior  of  pregnant  women.  To 
address  these  possible  channels,  we  test  for  impacts  of  the  gold  shocks  on  total  births,  mothers' 
demographic  characteristics  and  parental  behaviors  related-health.  These  results  are  presented  in  the 
following subsections. 
 
4.2 Other newborn outcomes 

We  next  explore  whether  the  gold  boom  improves  other  health  measures  in  addition  to  birth 
weight.  Results  are  presented  in  Table  3.  To  carry  out  this  analysis,  we  use  the  same  specification  of 
equation (11). The analysis is undertaken with the following birth health measures: the rate of premature 
babies  (less  than  37  weeks’  gestation),  rate  of  extreme  prematurity  (less  than  28  weeks’  gestation)  and 
low 5 minutes APGAR (Apgar score < 8). In panel A we show the results for the fraction of prematurity 
with  different  specifications.  We  can  observe  that  coefficient  is  significantly  negative  and  robust  to  the 
inclusion  of  additional  controls.  Similar  results  we  obtained  for  all  other  birth  outcomes.  Overall,  the 
results show an improvement in health indicators at birth. 

 

5.  Robustness check 
 

In this subsection we present  a number of  robustness  tests  designed to  assess the validity of our 
identification strategy. Specifically, we explore whether our findings are influenced by inclusion of other 
commodities (coal, coffee and oil), changes in mother behavior and changes in the composition of births 
or parturients. In general, the results from these robustness checks are reassuring.  
  
5.1 Mother Characteristics 

The gold  boom  can lead to  increase in  fertility  for women with  low educational  level  and credit 
restrictions against those women who have a better economic status.  This  change in  the composition of 
the  sample  could  bias  downward  our  estimator.  Table  4  presents  the  results  for  mothers  with  primary 
education or less, mothers with high school incomplete or less, mothers with high school and mother with 
college  or  more.  The  coefficients  in  columns  (1)  and  (2)  show  that  gold  price  shocks  have  a  positive 
relationship with the proportion of mothers with low socioeconomic status (SES):  when the price of gold 
increases,  babies  born 
in 
municipalities that produce gold more intensively.  

low-SES  (low-educated  women)  mothers 

increase  differentially 

to 

This  pattern  in  mothers’  education  distribution  support  the  hypothesis  of  that  low-SES  mothers 
who are more likely to  face credit constraints will tend be more fertile than high-SES women when the 
economy experiences positive macroeconomic shocks (see, for example, Dehejia et al, 2004). Overall, we 
consider the estimates in Table 4 are encouraging because they suggest that our main results (Table 2) are 
biased downwards by endogenous sample selection, which means that the effects of gold shocks on health 
at birth is greater than estimated. 

5.2 Behavioral changes 

We next study the cyclicality of time-intensive child health investments. In addition to changes in 
the  composition  of  parturients,  gold  price  shocks  could  also  encourage  behaviors  that  could  harm  or 
improve infant health. In Table 5, we present the results of this empirical exercise. To obtain these results, 
we  use  the  specification  of  equation  (11).  According  to  the  existing  empirical  literature;  we  also  find  a 
countercyclical relationship between prenatal care visits and the gold boom. From column (1) to (3), we 
observe  a  significant  deterioration  in  the  use  of  the  prenatal  care  service  among  mothers:    the  average 
number  of  prenatal  care  visits  decreases,  the  proportion  of  mothers  with  less  than  5  prenatal  care  visits 
increases,  and  the  proportion  of  mothers  with  more  than  7  prenatal  care  visits  decreases.  This  result  is 
consistent  with  the  fact  that  time-intensive  activities  decrease  as  a  result  of  a  positive  shock  in  the 
economy  (Dehejia  and  Lleras-Muney,  2004).  Additionally,  this  result  supports  our  hypothesis  that  the 
income  effect,  in  the  case  of  gold,  is  more  important  than  other  factors  in  the  production  of  healthy 
children. 

5.3 Composition of births 

Another  potential  concern  that  could  arise  is  that  gold  shocks  may  generate,  through  selective 
mortality,  gradual  changes  in  the  composition  of  birth  cohorts.  Put  differently,  babies  born  during  the 
gold boom may be different, for example in terms of health, from what would otherwise they have been. 
This  empirical  analysis  is  presented  in  the  Table  6.  The  finding  in  column  (1)  suggests  that  gold  price 
shocks have a procyclical relationship with the total number of births: when the price of gold increases, 
the  total  number  of  babies  increases  differentially  in  municipalities  that  produce  gold  more  intensively. 
Overall, this result is reassuring, because the increase in total births could be interpreted as indicative of 
the improvement in survivability of marginal fetuses, which would lead to a negative composition effect 
on  child  health.  That  is  to  say,  this  change  in  composition  of  births  leads  to  a  bias  downward  in  the 
estimated effect of the gold boom on health outcome at birth. 

 

5.4 Other commodity and child health  

Another potential problem pervading our analysis concerns to the possibility existence of spillover 
effects in municipalities that are also producers of other commodities or are close to other municipalities 
that produce these commodities.  To address this concern, we use data from production levels of oil and 
coal, and hectares cultivated coffee for the  years 1988, 2004 and 1997, respectively. Based on this data, 
𝑟 ×
we  estimate  a  broader  specification  of  our  base  model  (Equation  1)  adding  the  term  𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑚𝑑
𝛾𝑦𝑡 for each commodity which is an interaction between the production (or cultivated area) and year-by-
month  fixed.  In  this  specification,  we  consider  some  possible  contemporary  booms  or  busts  to  gold  in 
other  commodities,  which  could  drive  our  estimator  of  the  impact  of  gold  shocks  on  early  health 
outcomes. 

Table 7 shows the results to this exercise. The column (1) is our benchmark specification, which 
we  use  to  compare  it  with  the  other  specifications.  In  columns  (2)  to  (3)  we  look  whether  the  main 
estimator changes in magnitude and significance when we control for oil production, coal production and 
coffee  hectares.  Note  that  the  results  for  LBW  LVBW  and  IMR  are  reasonably  robust  across  the 
alternative specifications.  Indeed, when we include all three commodities in  the same specification, our 
finding  remains  unchanged  in  both  the  level  of  statistical  significance  and  the  magnitude  of  the  effect. 
These results reduce concerns that the improvement in  health at  birth  may  be  due to  price variations in 
other commodities than gold. 

 

6.  Exploring market channel 
 

We  next  study  whether  the  surge  in  gold  world  prices  propelled  economic  activity  in  the 
municipalities that produce this precious metal. The literature on the curse of natural resources points out 
that  the  abundance  of  natural  resources  would  fail  to  provide  a  better  quality  of  life  for  the  population, 
and in particular, under the context of poor quality institutions and bad governance. However, the debate 
is still open. A recent contribution by Aragón and Rud ( 2013) studied the effect of the expansion of the 
largest gold mine in Peru on local living standards using households’ survey data for the period 1997 to 
2006. The authors found that the expansion of the mine has a positive impact on nominal and real income 
of  the  local  population.  They  argue  that  a  possible  channel  of  transmission  through  which  these  effects 
emerge is the existence of backward linkages.  

Given our limited information on the labor market,  we will try to  verify whether the increase in 
international gold prices has led to changes in the labor participation rate of mothers in the gold producing 
municipalities.  For  this  purpose,  we  will  use  information  regarding  the  type  of  mother’s  social  security 
regime  in  health.  In  particular,  we  estimate  the  relationship  between  the  proportion  of  mothers  with  a 
contributory  regime  and  our  main  dependent  variable.  This  type  of  social  protection,  according  to  the 
Colombia’ Ministry of Health, is mandatory for formal workers and other people with the capacity to pay. 
While  the  other  regime,  subsidized,  is  for  the  unemployed,  informal  sector  workers  and  the  poor. 
Therefore, knowing if the mother is affiliated or not to the contributory regime is  a good proxy to have 
information  about  their  labor  participation.  Table  8  presents  the  results  for  this  exercise.  In  this 
specification,  we  restricted  the  sample  to  municipalities  with  gold  production  in  2004.  Note  that  in  all 
cases,  the  estimates  of  are  significantly  positive  and  robust  to  the  inclusion  of  additional  controls.  This 
result reinforces the idea that the income effect is greater in magnitude than any other opposite effect. 

7.  Final remark 
 

This  paper  exploits  the  local  economic  shocks  induced  by  the  2000s  surge  international  gold 
prices  to  provide  credible  estimates  of  the  effect  of  economic  conditions  on  infant  health  in  the 
Colombian  context.  We  take  advantage  of  the  persistence  of  the  shock,  which  we  can  assume  is 
exogenous  due  to  two  factors:  (i)  Colombia  has  no  market  power  to  influence  international  gold  prices 
(Colombia ranks 21th in gold production worldwide) and (ii) gold mines are randomly distributed among 
municipalities by natural factors. Using information of around 11 million births between 1998 and 2014, 
we have found that the prenatal exposure to gold boom improved the initial health endowments.  

Because the type of women who have children in positive business cycles may differ from those 
who choose to postpone fertility, we check whether the shock of gold led to changes in the composition 
of parturients. Knowing this is important since parental characteristics are correlated to the health status 
of children and therefore, a change in  the selective timing of conceptions can lead to differences  in  the 
birth outcomes during the economic cycle. In this analysis, we find that less-educated mothers are more 
likely  to  have  children  during  gold  boom,  thus  decreasing  the  average  health  status  of  their  babies.  In 
contrast, we observed that high-educated mothers choose to postpone fertility. In addition, the gold boom 
may  lead  to  change  in  mothers'  health-related  behaviors.  We  find  evidence  that  gold  price  shock  had  a 
negative effect on prenatal care visits, which would lead to a decrease in children's health. 

Overall, our results can be interpreted as follows: exposure to the boom in international gold price 
led  to  improve  in  initial  health  endowments  differentially  in  areas  that  produce  more  gold,  even  with 
negative  effects  such  as  the  increase  in  the  proportion  of  low-SES  mothers,  decrease  in  the  number  of 
prenatal  visits  and  the  degradation  of  the  environment.  This  suggests  that,  given  that  women’s  health 
behavior  worsens  with  gold  boom  and  that  incomes  are  higher  in  this  cycle,  it  would  seem  that  the 
income effect is an important determinant of health. Our main results are compatible with those obtained 
by  Bozzoli  and  Quintana-Domeque  (2014)  and  Burlando  (2014)  ,who  found  a  net  negative  effect  on 
health  at  the  birth  of  the  Argentine  macroeconomic  collapse  between  2001  and  2002  and  an  electric 
blackout in Tanzania, respectively. 

Regarding  possible  mechanisms,  we  analyze  the  relationship  between  main  dependent  variable 
and the proportion of women with a contributory health regime, which covers formal workers and other 

people  with  the  capacity  to  pay.  We  find  a  positive  relationship  between  these  variables.  This  suggests 
that  the  shock  may  have  generated  an  increase  in  the  real  income  of  the  locating  households  in  the 
producing municipalities, which led to an improvement in the health of both the mother and the newborn. 
This  result  reinforces  the  idea  that  the  income  effect  is  greater  in  magnitude  than  any  other  opposite 
effect. 

There  are  certain  limitations  of  this  study  that  must  be  acknowledged.  Probably  the  most 
important one is the absence of information on direct measures of mothers' labor market outcomes which 
prevents  us  from  obtaining  accurate  estimates  of  the  labor  market  mechanism.  However,  our  findings 
represent an advance in understanding the impact of changes in economic conditions on children’s health, 
which is important for policy formulations that aim to reduce economic inequality among individuals.

Notes:  The dependent variable is the fraction of children born - by sex, municipality, month and year. The effect of a 20% increase 
in gold prices is computed by multiplying the average production of gold- producing municipalities by the coefficient on Gold pro- 
duction2004 x gold price, and dividing the resulting value by the mean of dependent variable. “Other controls” include the newborn's 
sex, mother’s school attainment, maternal age and mother's marital status. Estimates are weighted using the number of birth. Robust 
standard errors are in parentheses and are clustered at the municipality-months level. Yes that means that the group of variables is 
included in the regressions. Significance : ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.
