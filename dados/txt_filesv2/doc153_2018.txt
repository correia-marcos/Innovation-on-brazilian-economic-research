Abstract

This paper analyzes the evolution of opportunity inequality in Brazilian municipalities over the
period 2000-2010. Given the complementarity in the provision of basic services, a Multidi-
mensional Human Opportunity Index is estimated in order to directly account for such eﬀect.
While Brazil improved its fairness in terms of the simultaneous access to public goods over the
years, adequate sanitation and safe water remained the country’s most severe housing infrastruc-
ture bottlenecks. Regarding the spatial association patterns, Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis
corroborated the recent literature evidences of spatial autocorrelation and a North-South polar-
ization in the period.

Resumo

O presente estudo analisa a evolução da desigualdade de oportunidade nos municípios brasileiros
no período 2000-2010. Dada a complementariedade na provisão de serviços básicos, o Índice
de Oportunidade Humana Multidimensional foi estumado de modo a considerar diretamente tal
efeito. Apesar do Brasil ter melhorado ao longo dos anos sua justiça social em termos de acesso
simultâneo a bens públicos, saneamento adequado e água encanada ainda são os gargalos de
infraestrutura residencial mais serveros no país. Com relaçnao ao padrão de associação espacial,
análises exploratórias de dados espaciais demonstraram evidência de autocorrelação espacial e
reforçaram os resultados da literatura sobre uma polarização Norte-Sul no período.

1 Introduction
The research on the emergence of social inequalities among individuals has produced a variety of theoretical
and empirical studies. From the viewpoint of the full distribution of resources among the members of a
society, the existence of inequality would constitute an obstacle to social justice. Yet, from the seminal
work of Rawls (1971), outcome diﬀerentials would only be considered morally and normatively acceptable
if originated from factors for which individuals are held responsible.

Within the realm of Economics, the interplay of outcome, opportunity, innate characteristics and eﬀort
was ﬁrst discussed in Roemer (1998). A fair society would not be the one in which equality of outcome
is necessarily observed, but the one in which there is universal access to the necessary goods and services
for future individual development.
In this sense, as long as the access to these fundamental services is
conditioned by circumstances, inequality of opportunity will prevail. Thus, in order to ensure distributive
justice, public policy is to be designed as to equalize opportunities among individuals within society, not
their outcome.

Brazil is a country profoundly characterized by diversity and inequality. Although the empirical literature
is rather scarce, there are evidences that inequality of opportunity not only represents a signiﬁcant share
of total inequality (Figueiredo and Ziegelmann, 2010; Figueiredo and Silva, 2012), but is also unevenly
distributed in space (Dill and Gonçalves, 2013; Ferreira et al., 2017). Yet, as discussed in Islam and Mitra
(2017), equality of opportunity should be understood through a multidimensional framework in which the
complementarity in the provision of each basic service is directly accounted for. The present paper, to the
best of our knowledge, is the ﬁrst study to measure such complementarity through the Multidimensional
Human Opportunity Index using Brazilian data. The latter index was developed by Islam and Mitra
(2017) and is constructed by assessing the joint access to basic services by children under 16 years of age.
Methodologically, the Multidimensional Human Opportunity Index extends the Human Opportunity Index
of Barros et al. (2009) to a holistic approach. Furthermore, the focus on children is assumed as to expurgate
the inﬂuence of eﬀort on the access to these services.

The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we evaluate the degree of opportunity inequality in the
Brazilian municipalities through estimates of the Multidimensional Human Opportunity Index using data
from the 2000 and 2010 Demographic Censuses. The obtained results suggest that Brazil has substantially
improved its fairness in terms of equalizing the access to adequate sanitation, safe water, electricity and
basic education during the period. Second, spatial association patterns are evaluated in order to statistically
identify potential inequality clusters and outliers within Brazil. Based on global Moran’s I statistics, there are
evidences of positive spatial autocorrelation in both 2000 and 2010. In addition, a North-South polarization
was identiﬁed through local Moran’s I statistics. In fact, high-high clusters were found in the Centre-South
region whereas the North and Northeast regions reported the presence of low-low clusters. Overall, the
results extend those obtained by Ferreira et al. (2017).

Besides this introduction and the concluding remarks, the paper is organized in ﬁve sections. First,
Section 2 focuses on the theoretical interplay of distributive justice and equality of opportunity. Section
3 discusses the empirical results obtained by both the international and Brazilian literature concerning
inequality of opportunity. Section 4 describes the methodological aspects of the Multidimensional Human
Opportunity Index. Section 5 evaluates the estimates of the logistic regressions as well as the results for
the Multidimensional Human Opportunity Index at the municipality level. Last, but not least, Section
6 presents the estimates for the spatial association patterns, discussing spatial autocorrelation and the
existence of spatial clusters and outliers.

2 Distributive Justice and Equality of Opportunity
The distributions of beneﬁts and burdens in a society are intrinsically related to the social, political and
economic structures from which they are built on. Theories of distributive justice are particularly concerned
with the morality of these structures and their resulting distributions. Given the limited resources of any
society, principles of distributive justice therefore provide the moral guidance to the political processes and
structures that deﬁne the allotment of these burdens and beneﬁts among its members.

In A Theory of Justice, Rawls (1971) outlines the notion of justice as fairness in the sense that it is

2

considered to be what free persons holding equal basic rights would agree to as fundamental features of the
social contract within an egalitarian societal structure. Under the aegis of the veil of ignorance (that is, the
deprivation of knowledge of individuals about their characteristics and their position within the society), the
social contract would be designed as to establish moral and social principles according to which all members
of society would agree to abide. Moreover, in contrast to the teleological reasoning of utilitarianism, the
existence of an inviolability founded on justice should ensure the non-violation of basic human liberties even
in the course of fomenting aggregate welfare. Hence, justice is responsible for securing a fair distribution of
primary social goods, that is:

All social values – liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases of self-respect –
are to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution of any, or all, of these values is to
everyone’s advantage. (Rawls, 1971, p. 64)

Consequently, injustice should then be considered as “inequalities that are not to the beneﬁt of all” (Rawls,
1971, p. 62). From the viewpoint of social justice, the amount of primary social goods held by an individual
deﬁnes their socio-economic and legal statuses. Ultimately, the resulting basic structure depicted by the
social contract in Rawls (1971) does not necessarily imply maximizing the amount of primary social goods
of the worst-oﬀ group.

On fair equality of opportunities, Rawls (1971) emphasizes that the merely availability of suﬃcient
opportunities to the least advantaged members of society does not satisfy the underlying requirements of a
fair societal structure. From the Rawlsian perspective, the equality of opportunities within society must also
account for factors beyond individuals’ responsibility. However, outcome diﬀerentials solely determined by
factors for which individuals are held responsible are perceived as normatively acceptable. Note that the fair
equality of opportunity argument does not require perfect equality of wealth and/or income per se, but the
compensation of characteristics beyond individual control, so that outcome disparities are exclusively due
to diﬀerences arising from factors individuals are deemed responsible. Equality of opportunities translates
into equality of primary social goods.

The central problem associated with the Rawlsian concept of justice, according to Sen (2009), is its
foundation on the perfect arrangement of a social contract. Even under the hypothetical veil of ignorance,
establishing a single set of principles to select just institutions would be virtually unfeasible due to the plural
nature of human reasoning, i.e., “there may be no reasoned agreement at all, even under strict conditions of
impartiality and open-minded scrutiny [...] on the nature of the ‘just society’ [...]” (Sen, 2009, p. 6). Further,
Sen (1979) also criticizes the resourcist approach in Rawls (1971). For the purposes of a theory of justice,
opportunities should not be purely indexed to the amount of primary social goods one has, but measured
by the substantive freedoms and abilities one has to convert the latter goods into well-being in the context
of their individual characteristics.

The seminal work of Sen (1979), Equality of What?, presents the concept of equality of opportunities as
freedom to achieve equal functionings. From the perspective of the capability approach, these functionings
are referred to as observable states of “beings” and “doings”, that is, “the various things that [a person] man-
ages to do and be in leading a life” (Sen, 1993, p. 31). Capabilities are then deﬁned as alternative sets of
valuable functionings an individual is able to eﬀectively achieve and to freely choose from. Consequently,
the purpose of distributive justice is to equalize capabilities, compensating unequal capacities to convert
primary goods (e.g. wealth and income) into functionings. Equality of opportunities is thus regarded as
attainment equality.

Despite also rejecting the utilitarian framework of maximization of welfare, the luck egalitarian concep-
tion of distributive justice, ﬁrst propelled by Dworkin (1981a,b), emphasizes that unequal distributions of
resources due to brute luck should be compensated for, whereas inequalities arising from option luck are
deemed fair. As Dworkin (1981b, p. 293) deﬁnes,

Option luck is a matter of how deliberate and calculated gambles turn out – whether someone
gains or loses through accepting an isolated risk he or she should have anticipated and might
have declined. Brute luck is a matter of how risks fall out that are not in that sense deliberate
gambles.

3

In this sense, brute luck constitutes outcomes an individual achieves that are not a (direct) consequence
of their decisions and intentional actions. The distinction between brute luck and option luck implicitly
identiﬁes in which situations redistribution is morally justiﬁable or not. Hence, the equalization of brute
luck among individuals within society would ensure equality of opportunity.

However, for Arneson (1989), the emphasis on resources as the equalisandum for distributive justice is
not appropriate. Opportunity should be deﬁned as the “chance of getting a good if one seeks it” (Arneson,
1989, p. 85). Consequently, in contrast to the equality of resources in Dworkin (1981a,b), the moral purpose
of justice is to equalize opportunities for welfare. Instead of relying on the insurance mechanism under a veil
of ignorance, Arneson (1989) proposes that resources are to be distributed among individuals so that equal
opportunity for welfare achievement holds. Yet, regarding actual welfare achieved, outcome diﬀerentials are
fair insofar as they are the result of individuals’ own choices. Here, the conception of personal responsibility
requires the accountability of only choices which are under absolute control of those concerned. Hence,

Whether or not two persons enjoy equal opportunity for welfare at a time depends only on
whether they face eﬀectively equivalent arrays of options at that time. [...] We may say that in
an extended sense people share equal opportunity for welfare just in case there is some time at
which their opportunities are equal and if any inequalities in their opportunities at later times
are due to their voluntary choice or diﬀerentially negligent behavior for which they are rightly
deemed personally responsible. (Arneson, 1989, p. 86)

In a similar fashion, Cohen (1989) underscores the intertwined relationship among preferences, innate
characteristics and resource availability, advocating against full accountability of individuals’ own decisions.
By integrating the principles of resource equality and welfare equality, Cohen (1989) accounts for access
to advantage as the proper equalisandum for distributive justice, being advantage deﬁned as both welfare
and resources. By the term access, the author refers to the standard concept of opportunity as well as
the ability to exploit such opportunity. Accordingly, the equal access to advantage approach therefore
stipulates that the only permissible inequalities are those arising from choices individuals can sensibly be
considered responsible. As stated by Cohen (1989, p. 934), “In a theory of distributive justice whose axis is
the distinction between luck and choice, the positive injunction is to equalize advantage, save where inequality
of advantage reﬂects choice.”

Within the realm of Economics, the interplay of outcomes, opportunities, exogenous characteristics
and eﬀort saw its ﬁrst formalization in Roemer (1993). Socio-economic and genetic characteristics, which
are beyond individuals’ responsibility, are conceived as circumstances, whereas eﬀort is articulated as the
autonomous behavior individuals’ are to be held accountable for. Outcome inequalities are just insofar as
they are only the result of diﬀerent eﬀort levels. For Roemer (1993, p. 181), “[...] equality of opportunity
for X holds when the values of X for all those who exercised a comparable degree of responsibility are
equal, regardless of their circumstances.” Consequently, unfairness arises due to either the direct or indirect
inﬂuence of circumstances on outcome. Therefore, in terms of distributive justice, such unfairness is to
be corrected through the removal of diﬀerences in circumstances or the compensation of their eﬀect on
individual achievements.

3 The Empirics of Inequality of Opportunity
Despite being a growing ﬁeld, the Economics of Distributive Justice is still considered relatively limited. In
recent years, empirical research has attempted to evaluate the extent to which inequality of opportunity
aﬀects individual achievement. In general, these studies are usually categorized into two strands of work,
which are reliant on their use of either ex ante or ex post approaches. More speciﬁcally, from an ex ante
perspective, equality of opportunity is assessed by evaluating the diﬀerences between outcome prospects
and the availability of opportunities across diﬀerent types of individuals, that is, across diﬀerent groups of
individuals partitioned on the basis of shared circumstances. Neither identiﬁcation nor measurement of eﬀort
is required. On the contrary, the ex post approach addresses outcome inequalities among individuals with
diﬀerent circumstances but similar levels of exerted eﬀort, thus requiring a measure for the latter variable.
As a consequence, inequality of opportunity is perceived as inequality within the class of individuals at
the same eﬀort level. Note that both direct and indirect measures of inequality of opportunities as well

4

as parametric and nonparametric estimation methods are viable within each of these strands.1 However,
due to the rather unobservable nature of eﬀort and circumstances, the ongoing debate on the appropriate
measurement procedure is yet far from being settled.

Even though ex post empirical assessments are rather scare, the literature has grown in the last few years.
For instance, Pistolesi (2009) analyzed the extent of inequality of opportunity for earnings acquisition in
the United States. Eﬀort consists of two characteristics, namely human capital accumulation (identiﬁed as
individual schooling attainment) and labor supply behavior (identiﬁed as annual working hours). Circum-
stances are comprised of individual social background. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics from
1968 to 2001, the results showed that schooling choices are relatively more aﬀected by social background
in comparison to the eﬀects on labor supply decisions. In order to measure inequality of opportunity, the
observed earnings distributions are thus compared to the simulated counterfactual distributions of equalized
eﬀort and of identical circumstances. Inequality of opportunity was found to account for 20 to 43 percent
of earnings inequality over the period considered.

In contrast to the parametric proposal in Pistolesi (2009), the ex post analysis in Checchi and Peragine
(2010) implemented the mean logarithmic deviation – a nonparametric index with path-independent de-
composition – as the inequality index for the smoothed distribution of earnings acquisition in Italy. The
latter index is then decomposed to evaluate the share of inequalities due to circumstances (gender, family
background and geographic location). In general, their ﬁndings suggest that inequality of opportunity for
the entire Italian population is responsible for 19.5 percent of overall inequality. Nevertheless, given the
Italian population heterogeneity, inequality of opportunities in the North is greater than in the South, cor-
responding to 18 and 16.6 percent of overall inequality, respectively. Gender decomposition showed that
women are the most penalized group in terms of inequality of opportunity, especially in Southern regions.
On the other hand, relative to the ex post approach, the ex ante strand of work has received more
attention from researchers over the years. Focusing on the contribution of unequal opportunities to earnings
inequality in Brazil, Bourguignon et al. (2007) decomposed the eﬀect of opportunities on earnings into direct
and indirect components, where the transmission channel of the latter is established through eﬀort variables.
Based on data from Brazil’s 1996 National Household Survey (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios,
PNAD), the obtained estimates indicate that 10 to 37 percent of the Theil index for male earnings in urban
Brazil is due to circumstance factors (namely race, place of birth, father’s occupation, and mother’s and
father’s education), with 60 percent of this result being attributed to the direct eﬀect. Parental education
was found to be the dominant circumstance aﬀecting earnings, followed by the occupation of the father and
race.

In an ex ante study for nine developed countries during the 1990s, Lefranc et al. (2008) proposed the
use of nonparametric stochastic dominance tests to evaluate equality of opportunity. More speciﬁcally,
the authors deﬁned that opportunities are more equally distributed if the outcome distribution conditional
on circumstances cannot be ranked according to the stochastic dominance criteria. Their results indicate
considerable disparities in the equality of opportunity across countries over the years, with Italy and the
United States being the most unequal ones. On the contrary, estimates for the Gini of Opportunities index
are the lowest for the Scandinavian countries. In general, inequality of opportunity was mostly driven by
diﬀerences in mean income conditional on social origin.

Based on the social welfare function proposed in Sen (1976), an alternative set of ex ante studies on
inequality of opportunity focus on the unequal access to basic social services. First presented by Barros
et al. (2009), the Human Opportunity Index – a synthetic measure of inequality of opportunity in basic
services for children – combines both the coverage rate of basic services and the degree of equity in their
distribution within society. Using data for 19 Latin American and Caribbean countries from 1995 to 2005,
Barros et al. (2009) found evidences of overall low levels of opportunity in El Salvador, Guatemala and
Nicaragua whereas Chile presented almost universal access to the basic services considered. However, the
results are heterogeneous across the speciﬁc opportunities within each country. For instance, despite the
virtually universal access to electricity in Brazil, the estimates for sanitation and education are rather low.
On the other hand, Jamaica showed relatively high levels of equity regarding the access to education, but
1Direct and indirect measures refer to the amount of inequality that remains after any disparities in eﬀort have been eliminated
and to the amount of inequality that remains after equalization of opportunities among individuals, respectively (Ramos and
Van de Gaer, 2012).

precarious provision of water and sanitation.

Regarding the Brazilian literature, Dill and Gonçalves (2012) evaluated the inequality of opportunity
in terms of access to basic services in Brazil from 1999 to 2009. Through an application of the Human
Opportunity Index using data from the 1999 and 2009 waves of PNAD, the authors provided evidences
of considerable improvement during the period. Shapley decompositions showed that diﬀerences within
subgroups (such as race or residence location) are more relevant to the observed national inequality than
diﬀerences between subgroups. However, given the extent of heterogeneity among Brazilian regions, Ferreira
et al. (2017) underscored the importance of estimating the latter index for the Brazilian municipalities in
order to provide a better understanding of regional disparities as well as an analysis of potential spatial
correlation. Using household data from Brazil’s 2010 Demographic Census and Exploratory Spatial Data
Analysis (ESDA), the authors presented evidences of well-deﬁned spatial clusters in the Northeast and
Centre-South regions, which are characterized by direct and positive spatial correlation.

Finally, in a recent study closely related to this paper, Islam and Mitra (2017) proposed a multidi-
mensional approach to the Human Opportunity Index by considering the joint access to a bundle of basic
services.2 Besides measuring how socio-economic characteristics beyond the control of the child inﬂuence
their access to basic services, the Multidimensional Human Opportunity Index is also able to account for
complementaries among multiple services. Despite the individual access to basic services being almost uni-
versally available, the application of the latter multidimensional index to two Himalayan states of South
Asian countries indicated that only about 63 percent and about 50 percent of the population in Bhutan and
Nepal have access to the bundle of basic services over the period 2011–2012, respectively.

4 The Multidimensional Human Opportunity Index
In terms of development strategies, the equitable provision of basic opportunities across individuals is con-
sidered a necessary condition for intergenerational mobility and, ultimately, escaping ongoing poverty traps.
Developed by Barros et al. (2009), the Human Opportunity Index consists of a synthetic measure of in-
equality of opportunity in basic services for children.3 By combining both coverage rate and the degree of
equity in their distribution, the latter index is sensitive to biased distribution of basic opportunities toward
speciﬁc groups of children. Equality of opportunity is only attainable if the access to basic services is not
correlated to circumstance variables. Since circumstances are personal and/or family characteristics a child
cannot be deemed accountable for, detrimental allocation of opportunities to any particular social group is
perceived as ethically unjust (Molinas Vega et al., 2012). In this sense, the design of public policy should
ensure further distribution of these opportunities as to mostly beneﬁt vulnerable groups, that is, any increase
in the coverage rate of basic services should be mainly biased toward groups composed by children from
disadvantaged households.

Assume the existence of a society with N total children, such that i = 1, . . . , N. Deﬁne a binary
variable yi which assumes value 1 if the i-th child has access to a basic opportunity. Let X be the set of k
circumstances, with xj ∈ X, where j = 1, . . . , k. Consequently, xij corresponds to the j-th circumstance of
the i-th child. As the probability of access to a given opportunity is a function of the set of circumstances,
this relation can be estimated by means of a logistic regression model, so that

ˆpi(yi = 1|x1, . . . , xk) =

exp(cid:16) ˆβ0 +Pk
1 + exp(cid:16) ˆβ0 +Pk

(cid:17)
j=1 xij ˆβj
j=1 xij ˆβj

(cid:17) ,

(1)

where equation (1) is the estimated probability of the i-th child having access to a speciﬁc basic opportunity
conditional on circumstance variables.

As in Barros et al. (2009), the coverage rate is computed by averaging the estimated conditional proba-
bility across all children. In general, it provides information on the availability of a bundle or speciﬁc basic
service. Therefore,

2Even though Islam and Mitra (2017) ﬁrst presented an analytical treatment for the Multidimensional Human Opportunity

Index, the concept was already brieﬂy discussed by Molinas Vega et al. (2012).

3According to Molinas Vega et al. (2012), since children (ages 0 to 16) cannot be held responsible for their fate, they were

established as the unit of focus as to isolate the endogeneity problem of eﬀort and choice.

Here, C corresponds to the coverage rate, with 0 ≤ C ≤ 1. As C → 1, the greater is the availability of a
speciﬁc basic service within society.

However, this measure is insensitive to how equitably these services are distributed across individuals.
The degree of opportunity inequality is then assessed by the Dissimilarity Index, an indicator responsible
for measuring the diﬀerences in the access to a given service for groups deﬁned by circumstance factors
compared with the coverage rate for the whole population. In the words of Barros et al. (2009, p. 6), the
Dissimilarity Index “[...] can be interpreted as showing the fraction of all available opportunities that need
to be reassigned from better-oﬀ groups to worse-oﬀ groups to achieve equal opportunity for all.” Hence, it is
considered a measure of opportunity inequality. Algebraically, it is given by

(3)

with 0 ≤ D ≤ 1. As D → 0, the greater is the degree of equity and fairness regarding the access distribu-
tion within society. Given that equation (3) represents inequality of opportunity, (1 − D) is consequently
interpreted as the percentage of properly allocated opportunities (Barros et al., 2009).

Accordingly, the Human Opportunity Index is composed by equations (2) and (3), so that

HOI = C × (1 − D),

(4)
with 0 ≤ HOI ≤ 1. This index is generally interpreted as an equality of opportunity-sensitive coverage rate
(Molinas Vega et al., 2012). Note that if opportunities are not correlated to circumstances, D = 0. As a
consequence, HOI = C. Thus, as basic opportunities are usually not available (that is, C < 1), there will
always be loss of opportunity equality across members of society.

Yet, as discussed in Islam and Mitra (2017), one might be interested in evaluating the probability of
having access to a bundle of basic services, that is, the joint access to multiple services. Let Y be the set
of m basic services, with yh ∈ Y , where h = 1, . . . , m. If the i-th child has access to the h-th service, then
yih = 1; otherwise, yih = 0. We deﬁne strict joint access as the situation in which the child has access to
all basic services. Thus, a child is considered to be disadvantaged if they are unable to access any of the
services. Algebraically, the strict joint access is given by

(5)

Note that γi = 1 corresponds to the full access to the basic services by the i-th child; γi = 0, otherwise.

On the other hand, one might consider a child as disadvantage if they lack access to less than z services,

with 0 < z < m by deﬁnition. This ﬂexible joint access is represented by

ψi = I

,

(6)

with I[·] being an indicator function which assigns the value 1 when the statement is true and 0 otherwise. In
case of ψi = 1, the i-th child has ﬂexible access to the basic services, thus not being considered disadvantaged.
According to Islam and Mitra (2017), analyzing the results for diﬀerent values of z provides a robustness
check.

Despite the multidimensional nature of equations (5) and (6), the probability of strict (or ﬂexible)
joint access to basic services conditional on circumstance variables can also be estimated through a logistic

regression model as in equation (1). First, deﬁne ωi =(cid:8)γi; ψi

(cid:9). Consequently, we have

respectively. Note that the latter two measures are symmetrical versions of equations (2) and (3).

Finally, the Multidimensional Human Opportunity Index is given by

MHOI = ˜C × (1 − ˜D).

Similarly to the Human Opportunity Index in equation (4), the multidimensional approach accounts
only for the coverage of a bundle of services that is adequately allocated among distinct circumstance
groups. Therefore, universal coverage of all services could be achieved by either improving total availability
of services (coverage), by further equalizing opportunity across circumstance groups (distribution equity),
or by combining both strategies.

5 Equality of Opportunities in Brazilian Municipalities
In a society where circumstances are determinants of access to basic services, inequality of opportunity and
outcome are inexorable facts. People are not homogeneous in terms of their innate characteristics. And
these assertions are valid for Brazil, a country profoundly stratiﬁed by race, gender and geographic location.
For instance, in 2000, the probability of having simultaneous access to all basic services (adequate sanitation,
safe water, electricity and basic education) for a 10-year-old white girl in a three-people urban household,
located in a metropolitan area of the Southeast region, where the household head is a literate woman with
annual per capita income of US$ 3,739.12, is approximately 114 times larger than for a 10-year-old non-white
boy in a ﬁve-people rural household, located in a non-metropolitan area of the Centre-West region, where
the household head is an illiterate man with annual per capita income of US$ 693.5 (Table 1).4

However, the eﬀect of circumstances on the access to these services have changed over the years (Tables 1
and 2). Even though girls were found to have a higher chance of accessing all basic services, the discrepancies
relative to boys decreased from 2000 to 2010. More speciﬁcally, in 2000, the chance of a girl (ages 6 to 16)
having simultaneous access to all services was 1.25 times higher than a boy.
In 2010, the same chance
decreased to 1.08. Overall, results for each service suggest that gender has one of the largest eﬀects in
determining the probability of access to basic education: girls were nearly 1.36 and 1.28 times more likely
to have access to basic education than boys in 2000 and 2010, respectively. These ﬁndings are intrinsically
related to the recent reversal of the gender gap in Brazilian education mainly due to the resolutions of
international conferences engendered by multilateral organizations (e.g. the IV Conference on Women in
1995; the World Education Forum in 2000; and the Millennium Summit in 2000) as well as the historical
eﬀort by the feminist movement in the last century (Beltrão and Alves, 2009). Note that gender has been
found to be not statistically signiﬁcant, at the 5% level, for adequate sanitation and safe water.

4The annual per capita income of US$ 3,739.12 corresponds to the Brazilian per capita income in 2000. As for the value of

US$ 693.5, it corresponds to the annualized international poverty line of US$1.90 a day.

Similar gains were observed concerning ethnic discrimination. Relative to non-white children, the chance
of a white child having access to all services decreased from 1.50 to 1.27 over the period (Tables 1 and 2).
Notwithstanding the positive advance, racial inequality remains a challenge in Brazil. Moreover, whether
the household is located in a rural or urban area was found to be an important driver behind the probability
of a child having access to the basic services in Brazil. In fact, the results are rather striking regarding
housing conditions. In 2010, a child living in an urban area had 10.92 times more chance of having access to
electricity than a child in a rural area (Table 2). Although nearly 18 percent of the total population under
16 years of age, children in rural areas compose roughly 86 percent of those without access to electricity in
2010. Moreover, for the same year, a child in an urban area was 6.85 and 5.28 times more likely to have
access to adequate sanitation and safe water than a child living in a rural area, respectively. As for the
simultaneous access to all services, the chance of a child in an urban area was 6.49 times greater than a
child in a rural area in 2010 – a 8.2 percent increase in relation to 2000 (Tables 1 and 2).

The obtained results also suggest that a child in a male-headed household had 1.12 more chances of
having access to all services than those who live with a female household head in 2000 (Table 1). However,
in 2010, a female-headed household would lead to a chance 1.05 times higher than a male one (Table
2). Among the potential explanations for such increase, one must highlight the cumulative eﬀects of the
deinstitutionalization of marriage and the higher life expectancy for women in comparison to men (Barros,
2001) as well as the process of female empowerment through (i) greater participation of females in the labor
market (Haussmann and Golgher, 2016) and (ii) erosion of patriarchal precepts of gender (Gandelman, 2009).
In quantitative terms, among those children without joint access to the four basic services (approximately
58 percent of the total population under 16 years of age), nearly 64 percent were living in a male-headed
household in 2010.

Higher per capita income leads to greater probability of access to basic services in both 2000 and 2010
(Tables 1 and 2). Yet, this positive correlation has decreased over the years for all services considered.
Similarly, the presence of a literate household head is also positively correlated with the probability of
access to basic services during the period. With exception of adequate sanitation, the higher the number
of people living in a household, the lower the probability of a child having access to basic services. Since
larger households in Brazil are generally poorer (Ferreira et al., 2003; Stampini et al., 2016), this negative
relationship corroborates the stylized fact that poorer households have consistently had less access to basic
services. The latter results are in accordance with those found in the Brazilian literature on the Human
Opportunity Index (Barros et al., 2008; Dill and Gonçalves, 2012, 2013; Ferreira et al., 2017).

Metropolitan location is positively correlated to the joint access to the four basic services in both 2000
and 2010 (Tables 1 and 2). In fact, a child living in a metropolitan household was 1.16 times more likely to
have simultaneous access to the services in 2000. In 2010, the same child would have a chance 1.39 times
higher. This result is similar to those in which the access to each services is individually considered. Finally,
relative to the North region, children living in the Southeast and South regions have the highest probability
of accessing the services. For instance, in 2010, the likelihood of a child having simultaneous access to all
basic services in the Southeast region is 6.51 times greater than a child in the North region.

Even though these ﬁndings provide valuable information on the importance of each circumstance in
determining the probability of access to basic services in Brazil, evaluating coverage rates and distribution
patterns of these services within each Brazilian municipality is still imperative in order to fully comprehend
intra-national heterogeneity regarding human opportunities. Consequently, the Human Opportunity Index
emerges as an eﬀective tool for that purpose. Subsection 5.1 is responsible for such analysis.

5.1 Evidences from the Multidimensional Human Opportunity Index
Human Opportunity in Brazil has increased considerably between 2000 and 2010. The Multidimensional
Human Opportunity Index (henceforth, MHOI) grew by approximately 5.5 percent per year over the period
(Table 3). This result seems to be mainly driven by the growth in the access to basic education, with annual
change of 7.6 percent, followed by access to safe water (2.2 percent per year) and electricity (1.4 percent
per year). Adequate sanitation and to a lesser extent safe water are the most challenging services in terms
of provision and distribution in Brazil. These ﬁndings are in line with the evidences for Latin American
countries (Barros et al., 2009; Molinas Vega et al., 2012).

Overall availability also increased during the period. The coverage rate for the joint access to all basic

11

services improved from 29.6 percent in 2000 to 44 percent in 2010 – an annual growth rate of 4 percent
(Table 3). Among the four services, basic education experienced greater expansion: its coverage rate roughly
increased 5.8 percent per year, which corresponds to an overall growth of 76.1 percent from 2000 to 2010.
According to Bruns et al. (2012), the expansion of basic education in Brazil is the outcome of several
innovations in education policy since 2000, such as education ﬁnance equalization and reduction of schooling
costs for poor children through conditional cash transfer programs. Although beyond the scope of this
study, one should also mention that this educational expansion was mainly focused on the sole increment of
enrollments, without any major concerns about quality and ineﬃciency (Oliveira, 2004).

But to what extent did the distributive aspects of opportunities change between 2000 and 2010? The
dissimilarity level for the joint access to all four basic services decreased 2.7 percent per year (an overall
decrease of 24 percent) over the period, which suggests that Brazil was rather successful in the pursuit of
the equitably allocation of opportunities among the population (Table 3). Although the dissimilarity index
for basic education decreased substantially (17.5 percent per year), inequality of opportunity in access to
electricity remained as the lowest one in both 2000 and 2010. The latter result might be explained by
the eﬀectiveness of the Luz para Todos (Light for All; henceforth, LPT) electriﬁcation program, which was
adopted by the Brazilian government in November 2003. For instance, the literature has provided evidences
for the positive inﬂuence of the LPT program on rural development (Gómez and Silveira, 2010; Coelho and
Goldemberg, 2013) and, more generally, on the components of the Human Development Index (Bezerra
et al., 2017).

Yet, the unequal access to adequate sanitation remains a severe constraint in Brazil. Since sanitation
deﬁcits are mostly correlated with low-income households, usually located in rural areas and/or small munic-
ipalities, the higher provision costs associated to these characteristics led to the continued underinvestment
in the sector (Toneto Junior and Saiani, 2006). In fact, the ﬁndings for 2000 suggest that, in average, ap-
proximately 28 percent of the sanitation opportunities would need to be reassigned from the non-vulnerable
groups to the vulnerable groups for equality of opportunity to prevail (Table 3). In 2010, this redistribution
would consist of 23 percent – an annual decrease of 1.9 percent.

Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that Brazil has improved its fairness in terms of equality of opportunity.
However, Brazil is a multicultural and socio-economic diverse country, characterized by profound regional
heterogeneity. Therefore, in order to eﬀectively contemplate such regional heterogeneity, the spatial dis-
tribution of opportunities among the Brazilian municipalities is evaluated. Figure 1 presents the results
for the MHOI among the Brazilian municipalities in 2000 and 2010. Even though overall improvement is
readily evident, North and Northeast regions remained with the worst indicators. For instance, only 45.5
percent of the Brazilian municipalities exhibited MHOI above the national average – 25.6 percent (Table 3)
– in 2010. Yet, Northern and Northeastern municipalities composed merely 12 percent of those above the
national average. In other words, from a total of 2242 municipalities in these regions, only 303 reported
MHOI above 25.6 percent in 2010. Note that the highest value in these regions was 50.5 percent, which
corresponds to the MHOI of Fernando de Noronha, in the state of Pernambuco.

The ﬁndings also suggest that opportunities to the joint access to basic services are more equitably allo-

cated in the South and Southeast regions in comparison to the rest of the country. Southern municipalities
presented an average MHOI of 22.7 percent and 30.2 percent in 2000 and 2010, respectively. As for the
Southeast region, the average MHOI was 23.1 percent in 2000 and 32.7 percent in 2010. Note that these
results were above the national average in both years. In fact, approximately 74.5 percent of the Brazilian
municipalities with MHOI above 25.6 percent were located in these regions in 2010. More speciﬁcally, the
state of São Paulo concentrated nearly 24 percent of the latter municipalities, followed by the states of Minas
Gerais (18 percent) and Paraná (11 percent).

The distribution patterns vary substantially across basic services. Despite the marginal improvement
between 2000 and 2010, opportunity to access adequate sanitation still remained Brazil’s biggest housing
infrastructure deﬁcit. Yet, the results for the Northeastern municipalities suggest a slight advance toward
equality in the region (Figure 2). More speciﬁcally, the Human Opportunity Index (henceforth, HOI) for
adequate sanitation increased, in average, 6.2 percentage points – from 18.9 percent in 2000 to 25.1 percent
in 2010. However, both results were bellow the national average for the service (Table 3). On the other hand,
the Centre-South region has historically shown results above the national average – 39.5 percent in 2000
and 46.4 percent in 2010.5 During the period, the standard deviation of the HOI for adequate sanitation
decreased from 15.3 to 14.4 in the region. The latter ﬁndings imply that not only did the Centre-Southern
municipalities improve their position in terms of access to adequate sanitation, but they also became slightly
more homogeneous.

In regard to the access to safe water in Brazil, signiﬁcant progress was achieved over the years. The
national average for the HOI increased from 58.5 percent in 2000 to 73.1 percent in 2010 (Table 3). Nonethe-
less, these results are characterized by high dispersion among Brazilian municipalities. Despite a 28 percent
decrease, the HOI for safe water reported a standard deviation of 14.5 in 2010. Similarly to the case of
adequate sanitation, the low opportunities for safe water are mainly concentrated in the North and North-
east regions (Figure 3). In 2000, the average of the HOI for safe water for the Northern municipalities was
approximately 50.2 percent, that is, 8.3 percentage points bellow the national average. The situation in the
Northeastern municipalities was even more precarious in 2000: an average of 38.6 percent. Even though
these regions remained bellow the national average, the HOI for safe water increased to 65.1 percent in the
North region and to 60.4 percent in the Northeast region in 2010. As for the Centre-South region, the HOI
for safe water increased from 70.5 percent in 2000 to 82.2 percent in 2010 – both results being above their

respective national averages. While these ﬁndings suggest that Brazil has recently embarked on a trend
toward equalizing opportunities to safe water among its municipalities, further improvements in the North
and Northeast regions are still needed.

Figure 3: Human Opportunity Index for Safe Water – Brazilian Municipalities

(b) 2010

Between 2000 and 2010, access to electricity became virtually universal among children in Brazil. The
HOI for electricity increased from 82.3 percent to 95.7 percent during the period. Yet, this positive growth
was mainly driven by the results for the North and Northeast regions (Figure 4). In average, the opportunities
to electricity increased 30 percent in the Northeastern municipalities, whereas in the Northern municipalities

14

this increase was of 17.6 percent. For instance, in 2010, 92.7 percent of electricity services were available and
equitably allocated in the Northeast region; the ﬁgure was around 93.3 percent in the North region. Besides,
the dispersion of the HOI for electricity among these municipalities decreased considerably. In the North
region, the standard deviation declined from 9.2 to 3.5 between 2000 and 2010. Similarly, the standard
deviation for the Northeast region declined from 9.8 to 3.1 during the period. Hence, these ﬁndings reﬂect
not only the eﬀectiveness of governmental eﬀorts to provide children with equitable access to electricity,
mainly through the LPT program, but also a development process toward homogeneity in the regions.
Moreover, despite the average increase of 10 percent in the period, the opportunities to electricity were
nearly universal and uniform in the Centre-South region (HOI of 97.5 percent and standard deviation of 2
points) in 2010.

Figure 4: Human Opportunity Index for Electricity – Brazilian Municipalities

(b) 2010

The case of opportunities to basic education is similar to the latter one. Between 2000 and 2010, the
equitable access to education essentially doubled in Brazil (Table 3). The expansion of the national HOI for
basic education is mainly determined by the respective gains of the North and Northeast regions (Figure 5).
In 2000, the these regions reported HOI for basic education of 34.4 percent and 29.3 percent, respectively.
These ﬁndings are the direct result of the low coverage rate and the highly unequal distribution of educational
services within those regions. For instance, only 38 percent of children in the North and Northeast regions
were in the correct grade for their respective age in 2000. Yet, in 2010, these regions improved substantially
their ability to provide children with equitable opportunities to education. In fact, the Northeast region
reported average HOI for basic education of 78.5 percent in 2010, which indicates that approximately four-
ﬁfth of the educational services were available and equitably allocated among its municipalities. Similarly,
the North region presented average HOI for basic education of 79.6 percent – a growth of 132 percent relative
to 2000. Nonetheless, the Centre-South region also underwent considerable improvement during the period.
In 2000, the region’s education HOI was 50 percent, meaning that nearly 50 percent of educational services
were available and equitably allocated within Centre-Southern municipalities. In 2010, the region achieved
a HOI of 84.9 percent for this indicator, that is, a geometric growth rate of 5.4 percent per year.

In general, the obtained results suggest heterogeneous patterns of spatial distribution among Brazilian
municipalities for both the MHOI and the HOIs for the four basic services considered. However, between
2000 and 2010, regional disparities have shown a tendency to gradually decrease, further suggesting the
presence of regional convergence processes throughout the country. Comparatively, the largest improvement
was observed in the opportunities to basic education, but signiﬁcant improvement was also noted in the

15

Figure 5: Human Opportunity Index for Basic Education – Brazilian Municipalities

access to safe water. Electricity achieved almost universal access among the Brazilian municipalities whereas
adequate sanitation still is the country’s greatest housing infrastructure bottleneck. Note that these ﬁndings
are in line with other evidences for Latin America (Barros et al., 2009; Molinas Vega et al., 2012) and Brazil
(Dill and Gonçalves, 2013; Ferreira et al., 2017).

6 Spatial Association Patterns of Equality of Opportunities in Brazilian

Municipalities

So far, the results for the MHOI have shown signiﬁcant heterogeneity in terms of spatial distribution within
Brazil. More speciﬁcally, the ﬁndings suggest that inequality of opportunity is mainly prevalent in the North
and Northeast regions. Yet, a quantitative statistical assessment of potential spatial association patterns is
still needed. To this end, Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) is performed. This subsection further
analyzes the existence of spatial regimes and spatial clusters in order to draw precise conclusions on the
interaction of opportunity inequality among the Brazilian municipalities.

The ﬁrst step in a spatial analysis is to determine whether there exists any spatial autocorrelation in
data. Accordingly, we ask, are opportunities randomly distributed in space? The underlying null hypothesis
of spatial randomness is rejected for 2000 and 2010, implying the presence of spatial dependence in the
MHOI. In fact, the global Moran’s I statistics (Moran, 1948) for the MHOI of both years reported strong
positive spatial autocorrelation among the Brazilian municipalities (Table 4).6 Consequently, there were
more municipalities with a high (low) MHOI surrounded by municipalities with a high (low) MHOI than
would be the case if opportunities were randomly distributed. These results indicate that equality of multi-
dimensional opportunity was spatially clustered within Brazil, which is in consonance with the preliminary
assessment of vulnerable children being concentrated in the North and Northeast regions (Figure 1). Yet,
the latter positive spatial association slightly decreased during the period considered. Note that these results
are highly signiﬁcant at p < 0.001.

The HOI for each basic service also presented positive spatial autocorrelation for both years (Table 4).
Despite the decline between 2000 and 2010, basic education and safe water remained as the services with the
highest positive global Moran’s I statistics. For instance, the global Moran’s I for basic education is 0.892

assumptions. These results are available upon request.

in 2000 and 0.890 in 2010, which suggests a rather well-deﬁned spatial polarization pattern in the period.
According to these results, as opportunity inequality in neighboring municipalities increases, the likelihood
of relatively higher opportunity inequality in their neighbors increases as well. Similarly to the results for
the MHOI, the latter ones are also signiﬁcant at p < 0.001.

Although global indicators are compelling tools to evaluate spatial association, they are not capable
of identifying potential spatial patterns at the local level, such as local clusters or spatial outliers. First
introduced by Anselin (1995), local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) provide useful information
on the matter. The underlying null hypothesis assumes no local spatial association. Consequently, the
rejection of the null hypothesis suggests the existence of local clusters (e.g. a low value surrounded by low
values) or local spatial outliers (e.g. a low value surrounded by high values).

Accordingly, the local Moran’s I statistics (Anselin, 1995) for the MHOI indicate the presence of spatial
grouping among the Brazilian municipalities in both 2000 and 2010 (Figure 6). These results are statistically
signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. A North-South polarization is readily evident. In fact, municipalities with high
MHOI surrounded by neighbors with high MHOI as well (that is, high-high clusters) were mostly located
in the Centre-South region. For instance, the Northern municipality of Espigão d’Oeste, in the state of
Rondônia, was the only high-high cluster core located outside the Centre-South region in 2000. In 2010, six
municipalities outside the latter region were classiﬁed as high-high cluster cores.7 In general, the number
of high-high clusters did not change dramatically during the period. On the other hand, most of the
municipality clusters with low MHOI (that is, low-low clusters) were in the North and Northeast regions
during the period. Only 10 percent of the low-low municipality clusters were found outside the latter regions
in 2000; the ﬁgure was around 8 percent in 2010.

Based upon the above evidences, the spatial segregation regarding the equal access to basic opportuni-
ties seems to be intrinsically related to the uneven development of Brazilian regions. As discussed in Smith
(1991), the perpetuation of unequal development patterns, coupled with regional economic growth dispari-
ties, would reinforce social stratiﬁcation even further. Governmental eﬀorts toward spatial (re)planning are
still imperative in Brazil. In the words of Roemer (2006, p. 243), “The rate of economic development should
be taken to be the rate at which the mean advantage level of the worst-oﬀ types grows over time.” Therefore,
in order to promote regional socio-economic development, public policy must be holistically designed as to
ensure greater access to basic opportunities to the population of these vulnerable areas.

7 Concluding Remarks
Has equality of opportunity recently increased among Brazilian municipalities? Even though the existing
literature provides evidences of the overall improvement regarding the access to basic opportunities in Brazil,
7The six municipalities are Espigão D’Oeste (state of Rondônia; North), Recife and Paulista (state of Pernambuco; North-
east), Lauro de Freitas and Simões Filho (state of Bahia, Northeast), and Fortaleza (state of Ceará; Northeast). Note that
Recife and Fortaleza are the state capitals.

analyzes at the regional level are rather scarce. In this paper, we evaluate the degree of opportunity inequality
in the Brazilian municipalities concerning the access to adequate sanitation, safe water, electricity and basic
education by children under 16 years of age. Speciﬁcally, we compute a multidimensional version of the
Human Opportunity Index for the Brazilian municipalities, in which the simultaneous access to the basic
services is used as the criterion to deﬁne whether a child is socially disadvantaged or not. The obtained results
suggest that Brazil considerably improved its fairness in terms of equality of opportunity between 2000 and
2010. Yet, access to proper sanitation facilities and safe water remained as severe housing infrastructure
bottlenecks. With regard to the inﬂuence of circumstances, whether a child lives in a rural or urban area was
found to be the most important source of opportunity inequality within Brazilian municipalities, followed by
per capita income and the presence of literate household head. These results are in line with recent studies
for Latin America.

Visual inspection provided preliminary evidences that opportunities were heterogeneously distributed in
space, with the Northern and Northeastern municipalities reporting the worst results for the Multidimen-
sional Human Opportunity Index. In order to statistically assess the spatial distribution of opportunities
within Brazil, Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis is performed. Based on the global Moran’s I, we found
evidences of positive spatial autocorrelation for both 2000 and 2010 indexes. Furthermore, local Moran’s I
estimates indicate the presence of a North-South polarization, with high-high clusters located in the Centre-
South region and low-low clusters located in the North and Northeast regions. More speciﬁcally, given that
the number of spatial clusters with below-average equality of opportunities increased in the North region
during the period (especially in the states of Amazonas and Pará), these ﬁndings suggest the intensiﬁcation
of diﬀusion eﬀects within the area.

As the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of equal opportunities among the Brazilian municipalities
is linked to their rather uneven development process, public policy is to be holistically designed and then
conducted as to reduce regional disparities. Only by eﬀectively targeting children in vulnerable circumstance
groups will Brazil be able to lead advances in reducing inequalities among its population.
