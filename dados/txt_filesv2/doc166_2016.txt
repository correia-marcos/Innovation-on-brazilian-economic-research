Abstract

In a competitive market situation a symmetric price transmission is expected,
the speed of adjustment of the market should be equal, no matter which direction
input prices are going (up or down). Any deviation from this situation is called price
asymmetry transmission. This study aims to answer three questions: i) Is there price
asymmetry in Brazilian Gasoline Market? ii) Is asymmetry a ﬁrm or a market fea-
ture? iii) Which variables contribute to the likelihood of gas stations to respond
asymmetrically? To answer these we run an AECM for more than 17,000 gas sta-
tions. Results indicate that there is heterogeneity across gas stations: 71% of them
have no asymmetry, 23% have positive asymmetry and 6% have negative asymme-
try. Gas stations with higher margins, less rivals nearby and non-white ﬂags have
higher probability to have positive asymmetry. Results reinforce the link between
power market and positive price asymmetry and bring the novelty of relating posi-
tive price asymmetry to spatial competition.

Resumo

Em um mercado competitivo uma transmissão simétrica de preços é esperada,
a velocidade do ajuste aos choques não deve ser diferente para choques positivos
nos custos e para choques negativos. Qualquer desvio desse padrão é chamado de
assimetria de preços. Esse trabalho objetiva responder a três perguntas: i) Existe as-
simetria de preço no mercado brasileiro? Assimetria é uma característica das ﬁrmas
ou do mercado como um todo? iii) O que aumenta ou diminui a chande de um posto
praticar assimetria? Foi usado um AECM para mais de 17 mil postos e os resul-
tados indicam para a existência de heterogeneidade: 71% dos postos não responde
assimetricamente, 23% responde positivamente e 6% negativamente. Postos com
maiores margens e com bandeira diferente da branca possuem maior probabilidade
de ter assimetria positiva. Os resultados reforçam o link entre assimetria positiva e
poder de mercado e trazem a contribuição ao relacionar assimetria com concorrên-
cia espacial.

Introduction

In a competitive market situation a symmetric price transmission is expected, and the
speed of adjustment of the market should be equal, no matter which direction input prices
are going (up or down). Any deviation from this situation is called price asymmetry trans-
mission. When input prices increase, ﬁrms need to pass on costs to avoid negative proﬁt
situation. When they go down, ﬁrms reaction is in direction to avoid losses of market
share (I am considering that inputs are common for the whole market, so, the other ﬁrms
also face to a reduction in costs). But, how fast do ﬁrms react? Do they react always in
the same way? Or the speed of reaction depends on the nature of costs shocks: positive
shocks having different speeds than negative shocks? Answering these questions is pre-
cisely what we do when studying (a)symmetry transmission price.

The standard pattern (price symmetry) is when ﬁrms react fully and with the same
speed in both situations: when input prices go up and when they go down. The most
common deviation of that is when retailers adjust output prices faster when input price
goes up than when it goes down. This situation is called as positive asymmetry, or
a "rockets and feathers pattern"1 (Tappata, 2009). Previously, positive asymmetry was
only related to market power, being used to quantify the extent of that and motivating
anti-cartel and antitrust policies. The intuition is that, as ﬁrms have more market power,
more they delay input prices decreases and the more they accelerate input price increases.
This behaviour allows to capture an extra consumer’s surplus, providing extra proﬁts in
the short run.

Mainly after Peltzman (2000), price asymmetry is not addressed exclusively to market
power or collusive behavior, being these only one of some possible explanations. Other
recognized reasons are consumers search costs (Yang and Ye, 2008, Tappata, 2009), menu
costs and inﬂation (Ball and Mankiw, 1994) and asymmetry in consumers search inten-
sity (Bragoudakis and Sideris, 2012, Lewis and Marvel, 2011) 2.

In the empirical literature, each study deﬁnes what is input and output prices. There-
fore, it is possible to investigate asymmetry into different points of market chains. It is
possible to say that input price are oil prices and output prices are the gasoline pump
prices or that terminals prices are the input prices and pump prices are output ones.

Speciﬁcally about gasoline retail market, Bacon (1991) found evidence of positive
asymmetry in UK market in a speciﬁcation that do not allow ﬁrms heterogeneity, hence,
the conclusions are related for the whole market. Deltas (2008) addressed heterogeneity
regarding US states (units are the 48 contiguous states, except Nevada) and concluded in
favour of positive price asymmetry.

Regarding Brazilian market, there are three (known so far) important references for
the price asymmetry studies. Uchôa (2008) testing price asymmetry between oil prices

1Price rises like a rocket, but falls like a feather.
2When gasoline price at pumps goes up, consumers tend to search more than when pump price go
down. This search asymmetry allows, by itself, ﬁrms to have positive price asymmetry (Bragoudakis and
Sideris, 2012, Lewis and Marvel, 2011).

and gasoline prices, concluding for the presence of positive asymmetric price. Canêdo-
Pinheiro (2012), following the same econometric approach of Uchôa (2008), used an
Asymmetric Error Correction Term to test asymmetric transmission between oil prices
and diesel prices. He concludes for existence of positive asymmetry. Note that, so far,
studies for the Brazilian market did not allow for heterogeneity across states, cities or any
other more disaggregated spatial unit, so the conclusions are for the market as a whole
yet.

The ﬁrst study to allow for some heterogeneity in Brazil was da Silva et al. (2014).
Authors investigated the asymmetry regarding distributors prices and pump prices. The
study used a city-level dataset and the conclusions were that around 70% of the cities
showed a symmetry transmission. The most important conclusion is to point that sym-
metric or asymmetric price is not an issue for the whole market, since there is heterogene-
ity across spatial units (states in this case). The point is: if it is possible the existence of
two cities with different behaviors regarding price asymmetry, why not to have this het-
erogeneity also across ﬁrms? A city-level is an important novelty, but still suffer with
bias summation, the effect of a gas station with positive asymmetry could be cancelled
out by a gas station with negative asymmetry in an aggregated database.

Therefore our study tries to contribute to this literature arguing that price asymmetry
is a ﬁrm-level feature, meaning that it should be tested at ﬁrm-level and not at country,
state or city level. This contribution was possible just because we had access to a rich
dataset that allowed ﬁrm-level information. The database is mainly from Brazilian Na-
tional Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuel Agency (ANP) with data from 2004 to 2011,
on weekly basis. Covering around 10% of Brazilian cities and including all state capitals,
the database brings information such as purchase price (input prices), selling price (out-
put prices), gas station address, gas station ﬂag, brand of provider and other. The total of
gas stations in Brazil is close to 35.000, after ﬁrst screening, dropping observations with
incomplete information, we still have more than 2 million observations and more than
17.000 gas stations covered by the sample. Around 40% of these 17.000 gas stations
sampled are covered each week in all cities selected of our sample. Hence, regarding
to city-level there is a balanced panel data, but regarding gas station-level we have an
unbalanced one.

Having the physical address of each gas station allowed us to achieve the geographical
coordinates of each observation3. To geocode the database allows to calculate distance
based variables such as: distance to the closest neighbor, number of rivals within certain
distance, to know if gas station has a white ﬂag gas station nearby, and others. With all
these information, this study tried to give one step ahead in the empirical literature of
explanations for price asymmetry, relating that to spatial competition. Thus, this study
aims to answer the following two questions:

Q1: Is there price asymmetry in the Brazilian Retail Markets at the ﬁrm-level?

3I strongly suggest a batch code tool to help in this task. Thanks to Chris Bell for providing the geocode

tool and for gently answered users questions at his website (www.doogal.co.uk).

Q2: Which ﬁxed effects increase (or decrease) probability of a ﬁrm to have asymmetric
behaviour? Is there any distance related variable important on that? Can we support
any relation between spatial competition and price asymmetry?

Procedures involve the use of an Asymmetric Error Correction Model (AECM) to deﬁne
how ﬁrms respond to input prices changes and a logistic regression to verify which ﬁxed
effects impact the odds to have positive price asymmetry.

Results indicate that asymmetry is really a ﬁrm-level feature. Brazilian gas stations
respond heterogeneously: 71% (8,015 gas stations) had no asymmetry, 23% (2,577) had
a positive asymmetry pattern ("rocket and feathers") and 6% (633) had negative asym-
metry. Regarding which ﬁxed effects could explain the probability to have positive price
asymmetry, higher margins, a minor number of rivals nearby and being a non-white ﬂag
increase the odds to have positive asymmetry4.

The rest of this study is organized as follows. After this introduction, next section
has a background of previous literature studies about price asymmetry. Third section
presents the database, followed by the econometric strategy and results. Finally, the ﬁnal
considerations are made in the last section.

2 Background

In a perfect competitive market, decreasing costs should be transmitted instantly; the ﬁrst
seller to react decreasing output prices would get the whole market, forcing all sellers to
decrease prices. In the same way, increasing costs should be transmitted instantly because
ﬁrms are operating at the zero proﬁt point, where small increases would be enough to put
the ﬁrm in a negative proﬁts area. Hence, changes in marginal costs are passed through
price instantly and fully, no matter what signal of the shock (positive or negative). The
fully and symmetric transmission is what the literature know as price symmetry transmis-
sion. Any deviation of this pattern, either to not fully transmit or to do not be symmetric,
is called by price asymmetry.

How price asymmetry affects consumers will depend on the speed of adjustment to
economic shocks, the sign of the shock (positive or negative) and the magnitude of the
shock (Cramon-Taubadel, 1998, Meyer and Cramon-Taubadel, 2004). Price asymmetry
necessarily causes changes in how surplus is distributed, being an issue with large im-
pacts on the consumers welfare, stressing its importance for policies purposes. Before
shows some examples how public policies can create price asymmetry, it is appropriate to
highlight the deﬁnition of positive and negative asymmetry. So, as deﬁned by Peltzman
(2000) and summarized by Meyer and Cramon-Taubadel (2004), we have:

4The percentages were calculated regarding total of valid observations (11225). Valid observations are
the gas stations with more than 50 observations and which showed a stable long run relationship between
input and output prices. It is better explained in page 11.

i) Positive Asymmetry: When output prices react fuller or faster to an increase in

input prices than to a decrease5;

ii) Negative Asymmetry: When output prices react fuller or faster to a decrease in

input prices than to an increase.

Returning to public policies creating price asymmetry, ﬂoor price policies, for instance,
could generate positive asymmetry (Kinnucan and Forker, 1987). As far as the whole-
salers believe that reduction in prices will be related with a trigger government interven-
tion, if they know that reduction on prices will be just temporary, they do not need to
adjust prices so fast, they can wait for the government intervention. In this case, public
policy input some positive asymmetry into the market, rearranging welfare, transferring
consumers’ welfare to producers.

These concerns about effects of price asymmetry in consumers’ welfare motivated
studies from regulation agencies and other organizations, most of them relating positive
price asymmetry to market competition. Bacon (1991), for example, studied the hypoth-
esis of collusive behavior based on price asymmetry. He used data from 1982 to 1989
and concludes that, in his sample, for United Kingdom, there is evidence of rocket and
feathers pattern. Note that the studied was supported by Monopolies and Mergers Com-
mission.

As studied by Peltzman (2000), a price asymmetric behavior is not just an exception,
actually he found a higher probability of a market to be asymmetric than symmetric. He
studied 282 products(77 consumer and 165 producer goods) and concluded that there
is a probability larger than 2/3 that prices react faster to an increase than a decrease in
costs. He also found a negative correlation between asymmetry degree and input volatil-
ity price. Results showed that price asymmetry seems to be the rule and not the exception
and it is, a priori, inconsistent with conventional microeconomic theory, which generated
challenges for the theory (Yang and Ye, 2008).

These challenges pushed literature to look for explanations for price asymmetry, some
of them independent of a competitive market assumption, which made a disruption be-
tween positive price asymmetry and market power or collusive behavior. The most com-
mon explanations for price asymmetry are summarized below:

i) Market Structure - if ﬁrms have some market power, it is natural to expect some
positive asymmetry. Here the link between price asymmetry and market power is
explicit (more market power is related to more positive price asymmetry practices);

ii) Consumer Search Cost - this factor is pointed frequently as reason for a non-
permanent deviation from marginal costs, for a rocket and feathers pattern of price
asymmetry (positive asymmetry) (Yang and Ye, 2008, Tappata, 2009). In Tappata
(2009), partially-informed consumers and search costs are the main driven force

5Literature usually calls this asymmetry as rockets and feathers asymmetry or rockets and feathers

pattern, because prices rise like rockets and fall like feathers.

to create price asymmetry. In Yang and Ye (2008), their model divided consumers
into searchers and non-searchers and it leads to differences into knowledge of the
true state, allowing a slow falling of prices. Note that, in both cases, the search cost
generates some local market power;

iii) Consumer Behaviour - Bragoudakis and Sideris (2012) pointed that during increas-
ing price periods, consumers tend to buy more gasoline (if they expect further
increases), while in decreasing prices periods the opposite is not true, or it does
not happen with the same speed. Other evidence comes from Lewis and Marvel
(2011), who studied gasoline retail market using trafﬁc statistics and conclude that
consumers search more when prices rise than when they fall, providing a "search-
based" explanation for positive asymmetry;

iv) Menu Costs and Inﬂation - Ball and Mankiw (1994) constructed a model where
menu costs argument6 in combination with inﬂation leads to positive asymmetric
price. Once there are costs to change prices, it is possible that the best strategy
to lead to costs reduction is to wait that inﬂation dissipates those costs reduction,
specially regarding small cost decreases.

Cited examples are important to highlight the importance to avoid reaching foregone
conclusions that price asymmetry is evidence of collusive behavior and/or power market
abuse. A more supported statement is that price asymmetry is evidence to a deviation
from a perfect competitive market, but not necessarily power market or collusive behav-
ior.

Regarding to control heterogeneity agents into price asymmetry issues, more recently,
using a database for lower 48 states in US, Deltas (2008) also found a rockets and feath-
ers pattern (positive asymmetry) for some states. In this paper there is an attempt to relate
price asymmetry with market power, and the author found that gas stations with high av-
erage margins have a slower adjustment and a more asymmetric response: "retail prices
respond faster to wholesale price (i.e.,marginal cost) changes in states with smaller price-
cost margins." (p. 614). Since this study provided evidence from a state-level sample, a
welcomed agenda is to try to ﬁnd similar evidence in gas station-level sample, such as
the Brazilian dataset used here.

Faber (2009) studied the gas stations pricing behavior in the Netherlands in a gas sta-
tion level and found that there is heterogeneity regarding price transmission. The sample
has around 4,300 gas stations and it was provided by Althon Car Lease. The company
leases cars with a "fuel card", from which information about price and location is pro-
vided. A bias selection could arise from this feature of the database, because only the gas
stations chosen by drivers are sampled, if they do not care for price (drivers do not pay for
the gas, their companies do), so gas stations with good extra services and higher prices
could be oversampled. Results indicate that 38% of the gas stations (897 gas stations)
showed positive asymmetric behavior, 7% has negative symmetric behavior and the rest

6Original argument is from Barro (1972).

(55%) has symmetric behavior. As far known so, this is the only paper addressed to treat
asymmetry as ﬁrm-level feature.

Pinkse et al. (2002) did a deep investigation about the nature of competition in termi-
nals. Terminals are not the same as retail gas stations. In the gasoline chain, terminals
are located between reﬁners and gas stations, they store large quantities of gasoline and
sell it to the gas stations. Their sample is a cross section with 305 terminals of fuel for
48 lower states7. Terminals may have global competition (prices of all rivals matter for
each terminal price explanation) or a local competition (prices of closer rivals have a
larger importance for each terminal price). In this question, distance has a central role
and the georeferenced database is necessary. They found that terminals competition are
localized. As highlighted by the authors, because of the database nature (a cross section),
temporal effects could give a more global feature to the competition, therefore, a panel
database is one of indications for future research.

Regarding studies related to the Brazilian market, Uchôa (2008) tested the asymmet-
ric transmission from oil prices and exchange rate to gas stations’ prices. He concludes
that increases in costs (higher oil prices or higher exchange rates8) are fully transmitted
to gas stations’ prices in the next period in 90% of cases. Meanwhile, decreases in costs
(lower oil prices or lower exchange rates) will be transmitted in the next period just in
5% of cases. Using similar approach, an Asymmetric Error Correction Model (AECM),
Canêdo-Pinheiro (2012) studied transmission from wholesale diesel prices and ﬁnal con-
sumers prices (pump prices). He concludes that there is price asymmetry and surplus
transmission from consumers to wholesalers.

Other important contribution regarding the Brazilian market is da Silva et al. (2014),
This study investigates price asymmetry in the transmission from distributors to the pump
prices for gasoline market. This is the most disaggregated study regarding price asym-
metry using a Brazilian dataset. However, even in the city-level, it is not possible to ac-
complish all heterogeneity because it is possible to have many different price responses
within a city, becoming possible that city-level samples suffer by bias summation. In a
hypothetical city with just two gas stations, one with positive asymmetric behaviour and
other with negative one, there is high chance that this city accepts the null of a symmetric
behaviour. The present study will try to overcome this problem with a gas station level
dataset.

3 Data

Our database is a weekly survey from National Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuel
Agency (ANP). It is an unbalanced panel, units observed are not present in all peri-
ods. The level of disaggregation is larger than municipality level, and each unit is a gas
station. Even though in small cities the sample covers all population (all gas stations are
consulted every period), in larger cities the sample is a random sample of 30% of gas sta-
tions. The survey has information as purchase price and selling price for gasoline, name
of gas station, address, brand, city, state and brand of provider.

The sample goes from 03 of January/2005 to 31 of September/2011 on weekly basis.
There is no gas station with prices collected only once. It has 606 different cities (Brazil
has around 5,500 cities, so it covers a little more than 10% of the country’s cities), and all
27 federation units are represented, around 300 gas station ﬂags and the total of 2,176,883
observations with complete information.

Units (gas stations) with less than 50 observations were dropped9, resulting in a ﬁ-

Our sample indicated that Brazilian market has around 29% of unbranded gas sta-

9Next section will detail the procedures to test asymmetry, because I run the model for each gas station,

and a minimal number of observations had to be chosen.

10We choose to encode gas stations by geographic coordinates. Therefore, we may have wrongly ex-
cluded some units, observations with different company name, but the same coordinates. The other two
options would be to encode by company name and by the address, but there are a lot of duplicate records
with much similar names located at the same place, which would wrongly duplicate some observations (in
small towns some street names, as streets with ex-presidents’ names, are very common).

Unbranded ﬁrms have roughly the same margins (Pinp − Pout)/Pinp) than the whole
sample, with average margins around 16%. The value also do not change if the ﬁrm
is part of the 3-largest companies. Regarding differences across states, Acre and Mato
Grosso have the largest margins (around 21%), meanwhile, Rio de Janeiro e São Paulo
have the smallest ones (less than 15%). Comparing ethanol and gasoline, ethanol ﬁrms
has, on average, 3% higher margins.

4 Econometric Strategy and Results

4.1 Is price asymmetry a ﬁrm-level feature?
Our ﬁrst goal is to test if price asymmetry is a feature of the whole market or a ﬁrm-level
issue. In order to accomplish that we will test how gas stations pass-through input prices
(values paid by each gas station to the distributors) to output prices (retail prices, pump
prices). Departing from a simple equation relating both prices, we have:

t = α + β.Pinp
Pout

t + εt

(1)

Equation 1 shows a long run relation between Pout

. The problem is that if
both prices have unit roots (and it is true for our sample), we have a spurious regression.
This problem can be overcome using a cointegration approach:

t

t

and Pinp

∆Pout

t = θ + γ.∆Pinp

t + ρ.ECTt−1 + εt

(2)

Instead of estimating Equation 1 with I(1) prices, Engle and Granger suggest to es-
timate the ﬁrst differences prices in Equation 2 followed by the one period lagged Error
Correction Term (ECT). Once the ﬁrst difference of a I(1) is I(0) the only problem re-
garding unit roots into Equation 2 is related to the stationary of ECT. Note that ECT
is the residual of Equation 1 and its stationarity means that there is a long run stable

9

relationship between input and output prices. Therefore, to guarantee that Equation 2 is
not biased, ECT needs to be stationary, input and output prices need to be cointegrated.
Regarding Equation 2, parameters γ and ρ show the short run and the speed of adjust-
ment of the model around a long run equilibrium, respectively. The greater is | ρ |, the
faster the model return to the long run path. Note that Equation 2 just allows symmet-
ric adjustment, in order to include asymmetric adjustment, ECT was divided regarding
positive and negative residuals. The equation with this split becomes:

∆Pout

t = θ + γ.∆Pinp

t + ρ1.ECT +

t−1 + ρ2.ECT−

t−1 + εt

(3)

If residual of Equation 1 is a positive value (ECT +), we are in a point where Pout is
higher and/or Pinp is lower than long run equilibrium, consequently, margins are higher
than long run equilibrium (consumers are in a worse position and ﬁrms are in a better
situation, ceteris paribus). If residual has a negative value (ECT−), it means that margins
are lower than their long run path (ﬁrms are in a worse situation and consumers are in
better situation, ceteris paribus).

t−1 and ECT−

Therefore, ρ1 and ρ2 are the measurement of speed of adjustment of the model when
we have ECT +
t−1, respectively. As the direction of transmission is from
input to output prices, ρ1 is the speed of adjustment for decreases in input prices
and ρ2 is speed adjustment for increases in input prices. Hence, we have asymmetric
adjustment around a long run path when ρ1 and ρ2 have different values, that is:

i) ρ1 = ρ2, symmetric price transmission;
ii) | ρ2 |>| ρ1 |, output prices respond slower to decreases in output prices than to
increases, rocket and feathers pattern - positive asymmetry - consumers are in a
worse situation than their long run path;

iii) | ρ2 |<| ρ1 |, output prices respond quicker to increases in output prices than to
decreases - negative asymmetry - consumers are in a better situation than their
long run path.

Then, to check asymmetry at ﬁrm level, the Equation 3 will be estimated, including resid-
uals of Equation 1, for each gas station in the sample and a F-test will be used to classify
gas stations among symmetric transmission, positive asymmetry and negative asymme-
try. Gas stations that we reject the null (H0 : ρ1 = ρ2) with conﬁdence higher than 95% is
addressed to be asymmetric response; gas stations that we do not reject H0 are considered
gas stations with symmetric response.

We depart from 17,273 gas stations, and excluding gas stations with less than 50 ob-
servations we remain with 14,489 different gas stations. The next data ﬁlter is regarding
gas stations that did not show a stable relationship regarding input and output prices.
Hence, we dropped more 3264 observations using the Engle and Granger cointegration
test in residuals of Equation 1.

Finally, remaining only the gas stations with cointegrated relation and with more than

10

50 observations ( total of 11,225, which hereafter I will call by "valid gas stations").
Therefore, running the AECM for each one of this 11,225 gas stations we found that price
asymmetry is not a feature of the whole market, where some gas stations showed posi-
tive asymmetry, some of them showed positive asymmetry and some of them showed no
asymmetry. This heterogeneity indicates that asymmetry should not be treated as market,
state or city feature, at least, for the Brazilian Market.

Detailing the results, around 29% (3,270) of valid gas stations showed asymmetric
price adjustment, 79% of them with positive asymmetry, a rocket and feathers pattern,
and just 6% of them with negative asymmetry. Hence, from the total of valid gas stations
we have 2,577 gas stations with positive asymmetry, 633 with negative asymmetry and
8,015 with no asymmetry. If I just consider | ρ2 |>| ρ1 | (without to use the F-test), I
ﬁnd that it is true for 58% of gas stations. Note that this number is reduced for 23%
in the main result because I consider as a positive asymmetry gas station units who had
| ρ2 |>| ρ1 | and did not accept the null that | ρ2 |=| ρ1 | using a F-test. Results are sum-
marized in Table3.

Trying to compare our results with the international literature, Faber (2009) found in

his study that 38% of ﬁrms has positive asymmetry, 7% has negative asymmetry and 55%
has no asymmetry. It seems that Brazilian gas stations have asymmetric price behaviour
in proportions close to the Netherland’s ones.

Regarding sensitivity of the results to signiﬁcance level of the test, if I chose 1% of
signiﬁcance, the number of positive asymmetric ﬁrms is reduced to 2577 (23% of valid
observations) and the number of negative asymmetric ﬁrms is reduced to 693 (6% of
valid observations), so the reduction on the asymmetric ﬁrms would be compensated by
the increase in the symmetric ones which would be around 71% of valid observations
(7955 ﬁrms). On the other hand, if I decrease the rigour of the test (changing signiﬁcance
to 10%), the number of positive and negative ﬁrms would increase. Number of positive
asymmetric ﬁrms would increase to 3956 ﬁrms (35% of valid observations) and the num-
ber of negative asymmetric ﬁrms would be 1303 ﬁrms (11% of valid observations). In

11

this case, the number of symmetric ﬁrms would decrease to 5966 ﬁrms (55%).

Regarding relationship between ﬂag and asymmetric responses, the share of white
ﬂags (unbranded) is 5% smaller into positive asymmetric ﬁrms than into other two groups
(negative and symmetric). The percentage of ﬁrms from one of the three largest compa-
nies is also around 5 or 6% higher in the positive asymmetry group. These differences
make us to think about which attributes could explain the likelihood of a ﬁrm to practice
positive or negative asymmetry. Which is the subject of next subsection.

4.2 Which ﬁxed effects could explain positive price asymmetry?
Once pointed out that there is heterogeneity in how gas stations pass-through the cost
shocks, in this next step I will try to contribute to bring some insights about what could
explain the probability of having a positive asymmetric ﬁrm. To achieve this goal I
constructed a dummy variable called "rockets":

rockets =

i f

0, otherwise.

| ρ2 |>| ρ1 |;

(4)

(cid:26)1,

The parameters used to construct rockets variable are those calculated in Equation - 3.

After that I constructed some variables that are time-ﬁxed for each gas station, for
example: the brand of the gas station, the brand of the closest rival, the average margins,
the number of rivals within some selected distances and the distance to the closest rival.
The idea is to check which of these variables can change the probabilities of gas stations
to practice positive asymmetry (remembering that rockets = 1 means positive asymme-
try).

In sum, I will use the rockets variable to run it against the ﬁxed attributes of gas

stations, and I will check if:

i) Does Spatial competition has a role in this probabilities? Number of rivals within
selected distances and distance to the closest rivals are signiﬁcant to explain the
likelihood to be rockets=1?

ii) Is it possible to tie the link between market power and asymmetry? Margins and

white ﬂags are signiﬁcant to explain the likelihood to be rockets=1?

For this regression I have the results of each valid gas stations (total of 11,225 valid units
- only gas stations with a stable long run relationship are used, i.e., gas stations that show
cointegration between output and input prices). The summary statistics for this second
part are in Table 4.

Exploring a little more the data from Table 4, around 45% of gas stations (valid ob-
servations) has no neighbours within 0.5km, and the mean of rivals within 0.5km is 1.69.
Regarding margins (Pinp−Pout)/Pinp), they have mean of roughly 15%, less than 10% of
gas stations has margins of 10% or less. On the other hand, just 10% of gas stations has

margins higher than 20%, with less than 1% with margins higher than 25%. Regarding
the dummy variables, the interpretation is straightforward, the mean is how much of the
category represented by one we have in the sample, so, there are 23% of valid gas stations
with positive asymmetry (rockets variable).

Note that I turned a F-statistic results into a binary variable and it was used to verify,
with a logistic regression, which variables increase (or decrease) the probability to be a
positive asymmetric gas station (rockets =1). Hence, I will procedure a logistic regres-
sion where p(x) is the probability to have positive asymmetry (rockets=1) and [1− p(x)]
represents the probability to have no asymmetry or negative one. The logistic regression
is given by:

logit[p(x)] = β0 +∑

j

β jXi j

(5)

Where the left side term, the logit[p(x)], is the log of odds ratio between p(x) and
1 − p(x). For example, if p(x) = 0.20, 1 − p(x) = 0.80 and logit[p(x)] = log(1/4).
Substituting logit[p(x)] by log[p(x)/1-p(x)]:

log[p(x)/1− p(x)] = β0 +∑

j

β jXi j

Taking exponential of both sides:

[p(x)/1− p(x)] = exp(β0 +∑

j

β jXi j)

13

(6)

(7)

In Equation 7, the ﬁrst term (the odds ratio) is explained by explanatory variables Xi j.
A logistic regression in the log form (Equation 7) is performed for two main reasons: i)It
gives us rapid answers about what is happening, a positive β j means that higher values of
Xj increase p(x) and negative β j means that higher values of Xj decrease p(x); ii) Only
applying exponential on the coefﬁcients, the odds ratios are easily reached. So, the results
of Table 5 explain the probability of the ﬁrm to practice positive asymmetry (rockets=1)
using the ﬁxed effects cited in Table 4.

In Table 5, the odds ratios have the same signiﬁcance levels and t values of the

Results indicate that the number of rivals within 0.5 km decrease the probabilities of hav-
ing a rockets and feathers pattern (positive asymmetry). It is the expected result, once
the increase of spatial competition should decrease the possibilities of arbitrage. Other
interesting result is related to white ﬂags (unbranded gas stations): being white ﬂag (un-
branded gas stations) decreases the probabilities of having positive asymmetry. This
result is in line with Hastings (2000), which argues that unbranded gas stations are corre-
lated with a lower equilibrium price and with markets that are more competitive. Pricing
strategy of white ﬂags gas stations is not related only with lower prices (Hastings, 2000),
but also with no differences regarding price transmission.

In the link between power market and positive asymmetry, higher margins are posi-
tively related with a higher odd of to have positive asymmetry, which again is an expected
result. Other variables were used to explain the rockets variable, but they were not re-

14

ported here because they were not relevant for the regression, and these variables are:
dummy for the 3 largest brands (1 when gas station has the same brand of the 3 market
leaders, 0 otherwise), dummy for each of the 3 largest brands separately, dummy for the
same brand of the closest neighbor and the brand of the closest neighbor. Controls as
the number of cars and the population of the city were used and the results remained the
same.

I tested some alternative speciﬁcations matching for the gas stations’ zip code and for
the city, and using the number of rivals between 1.0 and 0.5 km to avoid some overlap-
ping (source of multicolinearity), but the results found were basically the same of those
reported in Table 5.

Regarding the results from number of rivals within 1.0km, a counter-intuitive sign
was found, the increase of number of rivals within this distance increases the probability
to have positive asymmetry. We have some explanations for that:

i) It is possible that 1.0km is too far, meaning that there is no spatial competition
within this distance. One evidence for that is the larger probability changes for
rivals within 0.5 than 1.0 km (Table 5);

ii) All omitted variables that we do not have access with this database, presence of
convenience stores and service bays, for example, are positive correlated with prob-
abilities to have positive asymmetry. It means that omitted variables have clearly
a positive bias. The inclusion of those would increase the magnitude of marginal
effect of 0.5 rivals variable and likely change the signal of 1.0km rivals variable.

In other words, we cannot precise estimate the direction of rivals within 1.0 km, but once
all omitted variables have positive bias, we can guarantee that the signal of rivals within
0.5km is really negative, concluding in favour of existence of a link between spatial com-
petition and positive price asymmetry strategies.

To illustrate the impacts of each variable variable on the probabilities to have positive
asymmetry, I calculated the probability of being rockets=1 for some selected percentiles
(P10, P25, P50, P75 and P90). To construct Figure- 1 I did not use the central value of
each percentile, but the threshold. Therefore, for P10, for example, it was used the value
that divide the sample between P10 and P11.

In Figure 1 what matters is not only the value of probability, but how it changes
when I vary only the value of variable itself, holding constant everything else. For those
gas stations with lowest margins, around 11%, the probability that they are a ﬁrm that
practice positive asymmetry is lower than 20%, when we compare with highest margins
(P90), where this probability increases to more than 27%.

For white ﬂags, I calculated the probability just for one and zero values. To be a white

ﬂag, ﬁrm decreases the probability of having positive asymmetry in more than 2%.

Regarding the rivals within 0.5 km, when I change from 0 to 10 rivals, the probability
of having positive asymmetry decreases almost 4%. Note that these estimates are results
from changes in only one explanatory variable, and using the average values of all other

controls.

One possible gap in our estimates is to consider the role of distance in a homogeneous
way. For example, a distance from the closest rival could matter for rockets probabilities
for gas stations exposed to lower number of rivals nearby (such as gas stations located at
roads and small cities) but not for gas stations exposed to many rivals nearby (likely gas
stations located at downtown in capital states). In addition, the number of rivals could
matter for high competition observations and not for low competition gas stations. In or-
der to test that, I divided the sample by number of rivals into 3 equal groups: low, middle
and high number of rivals nearby.

The low density of rivals has no neighbors or just one rival within 1km (mean of
0.30); the middle density has between 2 and 6 neighbors (mean of 3.29); and the high
density group has between 7 and some outliers with 50 rivals (mean of 11). The idea with
this division is to verify if distance-based variables have different results according to the
number of rivals, regarding competition intensity. Therefore, we used two dummies to
separate the sample into 3 equal groups by competition intensity.

Results indicated that the coefﬁcient of distance from the closest rival kept insignif-

Estimated coefﬁcients for margins and the dummy for white
showed the expected signs and they were strongly signiﬁcant for all subsamples. The
only result that changed the behavior across subsamples was the number of rivals within
0.5 km. For the low competition we already expected a non-signiﬁcant coefﬁcient, once
the variable has low variability, being zero for the majority of the subsample. The surpris-
ing result was the insigniﬁcant coefﬁcient in the middle competition intensity subsample,
becoming signiﬁcant and with expected sign just for high competition subsample. These
results indicate that the number of rivals nearby seems to be relevant just for high
competition areas, not for the low and middle competition ones.

5 Final Remarks

The ﬁrst goal of this study was to test if there is price asymmetry in the Brazilian gas
stations, more speciﬁcally, to test if pricing strategies regarding cost pass-through are not
homogeneous across gas stations. Hence, we estimated an Asymmetric Error Correction
Model for 17,273 gas stations, from which the relevant subsample was 11,225 (units with
more than 50 observations and with cointegration relationship between input and output
prices). Regarding these 11,225 gas stations, it was found symmetric pass-through in
71% of gas stations, positive asymmetric relation in 23% and negative asymmetry in 6%
of gas stations. These results are in line with Faber (2009) and reinforce the assumption
that price asymmetry should be treated as a ﬁrm-level feature.

The second goal was to explain in which extent some features ﬁxed for each gas sta-
tion (brand, brand of the closest neighbor, number of rivals within some distances, white
ﬂag dummy, leader market dummy (3 largest companies), distance from closest neighbor,
average margins and others) can inﬂuence the probability to have a gas station with price
asymmetric response. I constructed a dummy called by "rockets" to distinguish positive
asymmetric gas stations from the other gas stations. After that I run this dummy against
cited ﬁxed effects. Results indicate that the number of rivals within 0.5km decreases the
probabilities to be a positive asymmetric gas station, and white ﬂags also seems to pro-
mote a more equal pass-through, in line with Hastings (2000). Hence, being a white ﬂag
(unbranded) decreases the probability of to be a ﬁrm with positive asymmetry. Positive
price asymmetry (rocket and feathers pattern) seems to be closely related with higher
margins (in line with Deltas (2008)), strengthening the most popular explanation for pos-
itive asymmetry, the market power.

This research is part of a larger agenda with many other questions that this study is

not covering here, for instance:

i) How to explain the role of distance in price competition not just in the ﬁxed effects
(smaller sample), but in the whole sample, using a approach similar to Pinkse et al.
(2002);

17

ii) How to measure the impact of a new rival in the neighborhood, relating this with

potential entrance theories and/or spatial competition approaches;

iii) How to measure in which extent convenience stores and service bays could bias

the results;

iv) I treated the probability of being a positive asymmetric ﬁrm (rocket and feathers -
positive) as binary, but it is also possible to use the probabilities of F-tests to have
a continuous variable of interest;

v) How to separate positive from non-asymmetric and negative asymmetric gas sta-

tions, giving more attention to negative asymmetric gas stations;

vi Here there is only one answer for asymmetry for each gas station, I am assuming

that the gas station do not change the pricing strategy, which could be relaxed;

vii) Finally, our investigation dealt only with gasoline fuel, but information for diesel
and ethanol fuels is also available. Therefore, investigating if gas stations deﬁne
different strategies for each fuel is also an interesting question for future research
agenda.
