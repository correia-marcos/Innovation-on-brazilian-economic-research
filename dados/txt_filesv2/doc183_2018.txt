environmental offenders. We employ a unique dataset of infraction notices registered by IBAMA, for the 
years 2000 to 2010, at the individual level, within the Brazilian territory, through the Survival  Analysis 
methodology.  This  paper  contributes  to  the  international  literature  on  the  rarely  addressed  subject  of 
recidivism  by  providing  new  and  strong  evidence  on  the  enforcement  effects  of  the  environmental  law. 
The  results  shows  that  the  delays  in  the  legal  process  increase  the  risk  of  recidivism  against  the 
environment in Brazil.

The Brazilian administrative law enforcement process and its effects on environmental recidivism 

1.  Introduction 

 

 
 

In Brazil, the Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) exerts the 
power of environmental police in Federal cases as part of the Brazilian Environmental Protection System 
(SISNAMA), is also performs the role of judging authority in administrative environmental law, as it is 
responsible  for  enforcing  administrative  sanctions  within  its  competence.  IBAMA  was  created  in  1989, 
and  it  is  linked  to  the  country’s  Ministry  of  Environment  (MMA).  The  agency  can  propose  and  edit 
environmental norms to the Environmental Council (CONSEMA), establish criteria for managing the use 
of natural resources, and regulate its procedure for investigating environmental infractions and imposing 
penalties  on  offenders.  According  to  the  IBAMA  normative  instruction  No  10/12,  when  a  violation  is 
verified,  a  notice  of  infringement  is  issued  by  the  inspection  agent,  and  administrative  sanctions  are 
indicated to the transgressor following the legislation. In this “investigation phase,” the assessed is given 
the possibility of defense. After that, IBAMA will proceed with a trial, and the offender may appeal the 
decision  to  superior  officials  in  the  SISNAMA’s  hierarchy.  Once  the  notice  of  infraction  has  its  final 
approval (after all appeals have been decided), then the law enforcement stage begins. At this point, the 
offender  is  ordered  to  pay  the  fine  assigned  to  him  at  the  time  of  notice  of  infraction,  being  the  value 
increased  or  reduced  by  mitigating  or  aggravating  circumstances  if  any  is  applicable.  Additionally, 
IBAMA must inform the Public Ministry if the violator’s conduct also configures environmental crime. If 
it is the case, alongside the administrative investigation, the criminal prosecution will take place, as civil 
liability procedures may also apply according to article 225, § 3rd. 

The  country  has  seen  immense  advances  in  monitoring  technology,  mainly  concerning 
deforestation in the Amazon region. According to IBAMA (2010), inspections  are planned and directed 
using  remote  sensing,  satellite  images,  and  geo-referenced  location,  acting  throughout  the  country. 
Instead of pulverized actions, monitoring operations became larger and focused on "major violators" and 
critical  areas.  Also,  the  electronic  assessment  of  infractions  is  making  possible  for  IBAMA  to  track  all 
current and past notifications, therefore the efficiency of the Institute in enforcing the law is increasing, as 
demonstrated by the higher rates of collected charges (IBAMA, 2010).  Administrative sanctions are far 
more  common  than  civil  or  criminal  suits  in  Brazil,  as it  happens  in  other  countries,  fines  are  the  most 
frequent sanctions1  (Levia et al., 2004; Billiet and Rousseau, 2011; Alm and Shimschak, 2014; Uhr et al., 
2018).  Previous  studies,  such  as  Assunção  et  al.  (2013),  Uhr  and  Uhr  (2014),  and  Uhr  et  al.  (2018) 
appoint that fact for Brazil, as fine charges became, thus, essential to discourage deforestation and further 
environmental offenses. 

However, the Brazilian enforcement process is often regarded as inefficient and weak concerning 
administrative  sanctions  (Hochstetler,  2002;  Kirchhoff,  2006;  McAllister,  2008;  Barreto  and  Mesquita, 
2009; Rooij and McAllister, 2014; Souza, 2016; Da Silva and Bernard, 2016; Garcia and Fonseca, 2018). 
Barreto  and  Mesquita  (2009)  point  that  the  effectiveness  of  administrative  sanctions  is  diminished  by 
IBAMA’s failure to comply with the legal deadlines for the investigation/ratification of infraction notices, 
there  is  a  high  rate  of  cases  with  long  processing  periods  until  final  judgment,  which  leads  to  statutory 
limitations,  and  non-compliance  to  the  imposed  fines.  The  authors  conclude  that  the  current  impunity 
perception  favors  new  offenses2.  Da  Silva  and  Bernard  (2016),  for  instance,  show  that  over  a  span  of 
twelve  years  only  1%  of  fines  applied  for  wildlife-related  infractions  were  actually  paid  in  the  state  of 

                                                           
1 Souza (2016) states that there are three main administrative  penalties at the disposal of IBAMA: the application of sanction 
charges,  the  imposition  of  embargoes,  and  the  confiscation  of  the  means  used  for  illegal  purposes.  As  pointed  by  Uhr  et  al. 
(2018), fines are issued with or without other sanctions, therefore being applied to all administrative infractions in every case. 
That is not the case for the remaining penalties. 
2  In  another  paper,  Barreto  et  al.  (2009)  focus  on  criminal  prosecution.  Analyzing  data  from  51  violations  against  protected 
areas in the state of Pará, the authors concluded that the criminal liability was ineffective: only 14% of criminals were punished 
and  15%  of  all  cases  prescribed.  Among  the  cases  concluded,  there  was  rarely  a  requirement  to  repair  or  compensate  for 
environmental damage associated with the application of other restrictive penalties. 

 

 

Pernambuco. Souza (2016) also points that an increasing in the collection of sanctions charges should be 
the  main  topic  to  improve  efficiency  in  this  field.  In  a  more  recent  article,  Garcia  and  Fonseca  (2018), 
evaluating  mining  companies,  suggest  that  the  impact  of  administrative  sanctions  is  likely  reduced  for 
two main reasons. The first being that, fines are disproportionally under evaluated considering the size of 
non-compliant  companies  and,  the  second,  that  issued  penalties  tend  to  go  through  several  years  of 
processing span. The authors also state that, even when recidivism is identified, fine values do not change 
much  (Garcia  and  Fonseca,  2018).  Therefore,  being  a  continental  country,  Brazil  faces  enormous 
challenges not only to monitor offenders in a Federal level, but also to enforce environmental legislation. 

The international literature on environmental infractions and recidivism is very scarce concerning 
empirical evidence3 mainly because data on such cases is almost non-existent (Levia et al., 2004)4. Levia 
et al. (2004), analyzing data for the European Union, indicate that the benefits of administrative sanctions, 
such  as  being  faster  and  less  costly  compared  to  criminal  proceedings,  are  compromised  by  the 
application of low fine values, a lack of aggravation in  the case of recidivism, among other issues. The 
authors also stress the importance of sanctioning recidivism with higher severity and in creating a central 
and  public  available  register  of  recidivist  companies.  By  comparing  the  effects  of  civil,  criminal,  and 
administrative lawsuits on recidivism rates for US companies, Miller (2005) have concluded that criminal 
trials significantly reduce recidivism among environmental perpetrators. Also, that civil lawsuits are not 
more  effective  than  administrative  actions.  However,  civil  lawsuits  against  firms  with  one  or  more 
incidents  significantly  reduce  recidivism  by  carrying  stronger  punishments  due  the  punitive  damages 
legal institute. In that way, Miller (2005) emphasizes the central issue of continuing enforcement to assure 
compliance  with  the  environmental  law.  In  a  literature  survey  of  empirical  studies  regarding  the 
determinants of imposed fines for the USA, Canada, and the European Union, Rousseau (2009) point that 
sanction  charges  tend  to  be  higher  for  repeat  offenders.  Blondiau  and  Rousseau  (2011)  test  how 
punishment decisions are taken in Belgium by using a dataset of criminal and administrative enforcement 
cases.  They  find  that  repeat  offenders  have  a  higher  sanction  probability  and  are  consistently  given 
stricter  penalties  than  first-time  violators.  Additionally,  firms  receive  stringent  punishments  than 
individuals.  

Our primary goal is to analyze the effect of the Brazilian administrative law enforcement process 
on  the  recidivism  behavior  of  environmental  offenders5.  We  focused  on  the  processing  status  of 
administrative infraction notices, with emphasis on the actual payment of imposed fines6 as an index of 
efficacy. We also consider a comprehensive set of 53 control variables that are related to the possibility of 
criminal  prosecution,  offender  characteristics,  local  environmental  monitoring,  and  socioeconomic, 
geographical, and institutional aspects of the municipality where the infraction took place. To do that we 
employed a unique dataset of infraction notices registered by IBAMA, for the years 2000 to 2010, at the 
individual  level,  within  the  Brazilian  territory,  and  applied  the  Survival  Analysis  methodology.  We 
contribute,  therefore,  to  the  international  literature  on  environmental  policy  enforcement,  on  the  rarely 

                                                           
3  The  theoretical  framework  on  recidivism  and  enforcement  is  well  established.  Examples  include  Endres  and  Rundshagen 
(2016),  Mungan  (2010),  Emons  (2003,  2007),  Chu  et  al.  (2000),  Polinsky  and  Shavell  (1998),  and  Polinsky  and  Rubinfeld 
(1991). 
4  Current  international  research  on  environmental  violations  and  deterrence  focuses  on  aspects  other  than  the  imposition  of 
administrative  fines:  criminal  prosecution,  threat  of  imprisonment,  spillover  effects,  corruption,  the  importance  of  local 
governments, and decentralized monitoring and enforcement (Almer and Goeschl, 2010; Billiet and Rousseau, 2011; Gray and 
Shimshack, 2011; Faure and Svatikova, 2012; Aklin et al., 2014; Blondiau et al., 2015; Sjöberg, 2016, Lynch et al., 2016). 
5 We use a broad concept of recidivism, which refers simply to the commitment of a new environmental infraction without 
considering specific legal aspects. In this way, recurrence may include general (the practice of new environmental 
infringement of diverse nature) or specific cases (same nature).  
6 Information on the current situation of each process, which comprises a total of one hundred and one possibilities, has been 
subdivided into seven status categories: (i) paid fines; (ii) assessments in progress; (iii) converted into other minor sanctions; 
(iv) payment of the fine in installments; (v) fine values enrolled in the active debt of the Union; (vi) prescribed cases; and (vii) 
canceled, suspended, or deleted records. We possess data on sanction charges indicated at the time of assessment by the 
inspection agent, however, at that point, fine values do not consider the offender's recidivism, if any. Monetary values may be 
increased or reduced later by the judging authority, and we lack that information. Therefore, we decided not to employ fine 
values in the analysis. 

 

 

addressed  topic  of  recidivism.  In  this  sense,  we  provide  new  and  strong  evidence  on  the  effects  of 
administrative sanctions and the enforcement of environmental legislation in Brazil. 

The  results  indicate  that  the  highest  risk  of  recidivism  occurs  when  the  process  is  extinguished. 
The second major effect on the risk of recidivism occurs when the legal process is subjected to statutory 
limitations.  Thirdly,  fact  that  the  process  is  placed  in  the  official  active  debtors  list  of  the  state,  and, 
finally, the fact that the proceeding takes too much time to be concluded. 

The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Firstly,  we  present  the  Brazilian 
environmental  legislation  regarding  recidivism  in  the  next  section.  Data  and  descriptive  statistics  are 
discussed  in  part  three.  Section  four  describes  the  applied  methodology  (Survival  Analysis  Models). 
Empirical results are discussed in part five. In the part six we analyzed the sensitivity of the coefficients 
of the section five. Final thoughts are presented under Conclusions. 
 
 
2.  Brazilian Environmental Legislation, Recidivism and Legal Procedure7 

 
Brazilian Environmental Law is organized in Constitutional, Legal and Normative rules. Being the 
most  important  rule  in  this  matter  regarded  in  article  225  of  the  Federal  Constitution  that  considers  the 
Right to an Equilibrated Environment a Fundamental Right for all. The paragraph third of article 225 also 
predicts the administrative, criminal and civil liability as applicable for damages to the environment. 

The  Administrative  Environmental  Law  is  organized  under  the  Environmental  Protection 
System’s    -  SISNAMA  Act  (Lei  6.938/81)  which  is  composed  by  the  Environmental  Ministry  (MMA), 
which is responsible for the administration of all Environmental Policies under the Federal Jurisdiction, 
the  Federal  Environmental  Council  (CONSEMA),  and  the  Federal  Environmental  Agencies  IBAMA 
(responsible  for  environmental  compliance  in  general)  and  ICMBIO  (specialized  in  the  protection  of 
biodiversity and the control of Federal Preservation Areas) responsible for environmental compliance and 
licensing  in  the  Federal  level.  In  State  level  this  structure  is  repeated  being  the  State’s  Office  for 
Environmental affairs the equivalent to the MMA, the State’s Environmental Council to CONSEMA and 
the  State’s  Agencies  usually  comprises  the  roles  of  IBAMA  and  ICMBIO,  the  same  is  true  for  the 
Municipalities level as the County’s Environmental Office is a counterpart to MMA and CONSEMA and 
a  local  Agency  is  usually  equivalent  to  IBAMA  and  ICMBIO.  Along  with  the  agencies,  offices  and 
councils, SISNAMA also is helped to investigate environmental non-compliance occurrences by the local 
Police Departments with special environmental squads. 

The  Environmental  Offences  and  Administrative 

the 
Environmental  Crimes  Act  (Lei  9.605/98)  which  predicts  sanctions  divided  by  themes  such  as  Crimes 
against the Fauna and Flora, Biodiversity, National Parks, etc. In this law, any environmental crime can 
be regarded as  an Administrative  Infraction, though  administrative infractions can be predicted in other 
acts,  as  the  Criminal  offenses  are  restricted  to  actions  previously  specified  in  Law.  As  for  the  Civil 
Liability  for  environmental  damages,  it  is  predicted  in  the  Paragraph  Third  of  the  article  225  of  the 
Federal  Constitution  as  it  is  also  mentioned  in  article  14  of  the  SISNAMA  Act  and  is  one  of  the 
exceptional cases of strict liability under Brazilian torts law. 

Infractions  are  consolidated 

in 

Finally, concerning the institute of recidivism, Law 9.605/98 does not mention the administrative 
consequences  for  this  matter,  although  it  does  predict  Criminal  consequences  in  article  15,  I  as  an 
aggravation or qualification circumstance to environmental penalties. Law 6.938/81 mentions recidivism 
in  administrative  sanctions  as  a  measure  to  aggravate  fines,  as  it  is  often  regarded  as  a  way  to  chose 
between different administrative sanctions given by Environmental Law (Lei 6.938) such as simples fine 
versus daily fine (article 14, I); restriction or loss of tax benefits of licenses conceded by the State (article 
14,  II);  suspension  or  loss  of  participation  in  financial  modalities  in  state-owned  credit  establishments 
(article 14, III); suspension of the firm activity (article 14, IV). 

                                                           
7 Uhr et al. (2018) do an extensive review of the current Brazilian environmental regulation concerning the general legislation 
on environmental infractions and the administrative process for monitoring and enforcement. Here, our focus is specifically on 
recidivism aspects. 

 

 

As for the Brazilian Administrative Procedure, its length can vary according to specific normative 
for  each  Agency.  Though  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (Lei  9.784)  gives  its  general  lines.  The 
procedure  will  follow  phases  such  as  installment,  instruction  and  trial  to  reach  a  decision  about  the 
appliance of the administrative section according to the stances presented by the State and the Defendant, 
though differently from the Civil and Criminal procedures, if the defendant do not pose its defense acts, 
the procedure will follow automatically by the State thus the will of the people should prevail on private 
ones,  being  any  abnormally  extended  procedure  length  thus  attributed  to  the  State’s  lack  of  interest  or 
capacity to continue the procedure itself. Though if the Administration fails to present documents, notices 
or  data  require,  the  procedure  could  be  subjected  to  archival  (extinction  without  a  final  decision) 
according to article 40. Article 51 predicts the causes of extinction without a final decision, which are the 
desistance of the plea of disposable rights or when its object is considered impossible, useless or harmed 
by a future event. In addition, the Administration can void its own acts when based upon legality issues, 
and  can  revoke  them  by  opportunity  and  convenience,  respected  acquired  rights.  The  right  to  void 
administrative  acts  are  limited  to  5  years  by  the  law.  Finally,  article  56  states  that  the  administrative 
decisions are subjected to appeals which can be imposed upon three Administrative stances according to 
the  hierarchy  of  the  Administrative  Agency  (article  57).  In  addition,  Administrative  decisions  are 
subjected to Legal Courts control according to article 5th XXXV of the Constitution. 

If  an  administrative  sanction  is  applied  to  environmental  infractions,  it  can  be  done  throughout 
simple  fines,  daily  fines,  activity  suspension,  detainment  of  actives  such  as  machines  and  other  goods 
necessary to production and the license of operation’s extinction, being the sanctions applied accordingly 
to the magnitude of the consequences of the infringement (article 72 and 6th of Lei 9.605/98). Though if 
the sanction applied is  the simple fine, it could  be converted to  lesser sanctions such as preservation of 
green  areas,  improvement  of  the  environmental  quality  and  other  actions  given  by  the  State  (article  72, 
§4th), though, if the procedure takes a time span larger than 3 years, it can be subjected to the extinctive 
effects  of  the  statutory  limitations  of  article  1st,  §  1st  of  Lei  9.873/99  which  established  the  statutory 
limitations on the Acts of the State. 

The  same  rational  about  the  Administrative  Procedure  can  be  applied  to  the  Civil  and  Criminal 
procedure,  thus  both  can  be  archived  by  a  lack  of  procedure  acts  due  to  the  plaintiff  or  the  State  as 
extinguishment  of  the  procedure  can  be  made  regarding  formalities  required  to  perform  procedure  acts, 
although in Civil procedure the latest reforms restricted extinguishment possibilities to a complete lack of 
performance of the plaintiff since article 76 of the Civil Procedure Code requires that the judge ask for the 
party  to  redo  any  act  that  may  extinguish  the  procedure  without  a  final  decision.  The  Statutory 
Limitations for the Civil Liability lawsuits are 3 years counting from the act itself, according to the article 
206,  §  3rd  of  the  Civil  Code.  As  for  the  Criminal  Procedure,  the  phases  before  the  presentation  of  a 
denounce from the Public Ministry, such as the investigation can bring possibilities of archival, firstly by 
the Police Authorities that declares a lack of interest of factual possibilities of continuing the investigation 
or  later  by  the  Public  Ministry  in  its  appreciation  of  the  Police’s  report.  Though  if  made  by  the  Public 
Ministry,  the  decision  must  be  reviewed  by  a  judge  according  to  article  28  of  the  Criminal  Procedure 
Code,  who  will  confirm  or  deny  the  archival  of  the  procedure.  The  Criminal  Procedure  Code  can  be 
suspended to resolve any controversy about facts and proofs needed for the decision of the judge to apply 
or not a sanction to the defendant,  as the judge can also suspend the penalty itself from 2 to 6  years on 
penalties  of  reclusion  and  detention  lesser  than  2  years  if  the  defendant  has  good  precedents,  and  the 
circumstances shows that it will not be subject of recidivism. The article 8 of the Environmental Criminal 
Act also predicts the conversion of the penalty to services provided to the community to compensate the 
damages  caused;  the  Statutory  Limitations  in  Criminal  Cases  are  variable  according  to  the  Penalty 
Applied,  according  to  article  109  of  the  Criminal  Code,  though  since  the  penalties  of  Environmental 
Crimes  vary  from  1  to  5  years  mostly,  from  4  to  12  years  before  the  final  sentence,  although  there  are 
more  cases  of  statutory  limitations  in  Criminal  Law  which  can  be  studied  further  through  the  Criminal 
Procedure Code, the Criminal Enforcement Act and other legislations on the subject.  

 
 
 

 

 

3.  Data 

 
The main dataset on infraction notices in administrative federal circuit is available for download at 
IBAMA’s website8. The employed  data covers administrative infractions against the Brazilian flora, for 
the years between 2000 and 20109, at the individual level totaling 127,873 records and 98,006 violators. 
Raw  data  contains  information  about  the  infringement  record  number,  the  violator’s  information  (if 
physical or legal persons, if public or private firms, including their names and social registry number), the 
date  and  municipality  of  the  fact,  the  magnitude  of  the  applied  fine,  the  status  of  the  administrative 
procedure10, and the legal basis of the assessment, indicating violations that can also give rise to criminal 
proceedings (potential environmental offense). 

Table 1 shows how infraction records behave concerning recidivism. The amount of data censored 
by the right (no recurrence) is 76.64%, and the average number of violations is 1.3047 per violator. The 
average  time  to  failure  or  censorship  is  2,309.58  days  (counted  from  the  first  record,  that  is,  after  the 
occurrence of the first offense, or after the appearance of a new infringement event for the same violator, 
if more than one case of recurrence). Recidivism cases correspond to 23.36% of the total infringements, 
that is, 29,867 occurrences and the violators who experience this event are 14,791, or 15.1% of the total 
number of offenders. Of these, 62.67% recidivate once, 16.92% recidivate twice, 7.53% recidivate three 
times, and 12.88% four times or more.

Table 2 shows the description and descriptive statistics on our essential variables, which relate to 
the processing status of administrative infraction notices, with emphasis on the payment of imposed fines. 
Information  on  the  current  situation  of  each  record,  comprising  a  total  of  one  hundred  and  one 
possibilities  in  the  dataset,  was  subdivided  into  seven  great  categories:  (i)  actually  paid  fines;  (ii) 
assessments  in  progress,  including  notified  cases  that  are  under  analysis/investigation,  awaiting 
approval/ratification,  etc.;  (iii)  sanction  converted  into  other  lesser  sanctions,  which  include  simple 
warnings  (no  fine  charged),  community  service  performance  or  social  compensation  for  the 
environmental damage; (iv) payment of the fine in installments; (v) fine values enrolled in the active debt 

                                                           
8 The information provided by IBAMA contained some issues that had to be addressed, such as duplication of records, fines 
with lower values than allowed by law, errors in the description of the municipalities where the violations took place, as well 
as missing data. For the latter case, the records were removed from the analysis. 
9  After  the  publication  of  Complementary  Law  140  of  2011  by  the  Federal  Government,  it  is  the  municipalities  that  have, 
through their environmental secretaries, the prerogative to supervise administrative issues within their area. This competence is 
absorbed by the regional entities when the municipality does not have its own secretariat and by IBAMA only when they are 
linked  to  national  parks  or  when  they  are  of  federal  competence.  Therefore,  as  of  2011,  the  records  registered  by  IBAMA 
reflect only part of the total administrative infractions. 
10 Data  were collected in May  2016; therefore, the current situation of the infringement processes  may be different  from the 
ones in our database.

Notes: Data collected in May 2016. Source: Records of infraction notices against flora collected from IBAMA, with 

occurrence between 2000 and 2010. 

 

Records with paid fines (QUI) correspond to 37,61% of total offenses and infraction notices with 
the debt negotiated in installments (SPA) matching only 1,77% of the data, giving an overall of 39,38% 
of fines paid or in the course of payment. Only 0,6% of violations were converted into simple warnings or 
other  lesser  sanctions  (CEO).  The  other  main  category,  assessments  in  progress  (TRA),  shows  that 
40,66% of the records in 2016 are still under analysis/investigation or awaiting approval/ratification. That 
represents  a  minimum  of  6  years  for  the  processing  time  of  this  phase,  supposing  the  infringement 
occurred in  2010. Other categories favoring impunity  are cases enrolled in the active debt  of the Union 
(IDA),  subjected  to  statutory  limitations  /  “prescrição”  (PRE),  and  extinguished,  suspended,  or  deleted 
(CBS), corresponding to almost 20%. Therefore, we can consider that roughly 40% of infraction records 
were actually an administrative sanction in the analyzed period. 

For the empirical analysis, we also considered a comprehensive set of 53 control variables, which 
are  organized  into  eight  categories  plus  the  possibility  of  criminal  prosecution.  They  are:  (i)  offender 
characteristics,  regarding  the  violation  performance  by  individuals  or  private/public  entities;  (ii) 
municipal environmental monitoring, including the existence of an environmental police station, presence 
of  IBAMA  superintendence  or  separate  technical  unit,  and  the  number  of  environmental  NGO;  (iii) 
municipal  geographical  characteristics;  (iv)  local  agricultural  production  and  fire  outbreaks;  (v)  other 
municipal  socioeconomic  variables;    (vi)  local  institutional  aspects,  including  the  existence  of  specific 
environmental  legislation  and  municipal  council  for  the  environment,  among  others;  (vii)  other 
municipal  characteristics;  and  (viii) 
local  expenses  with  environmental  control,  management, 
preservation,  and  recovery.  The  full  set  of  control  variables  and  descriptive  statistics  is  available  in 
Appendix A.  

Concerning  the  possibility  of  criminal  prosecution,  the  legal  basis  of  assessment  in  the  dataset 
indicates  if  the  offender  violated  articles  38  to  53  of  the  Environmental  Crimes  Act  (Lei  9.605/98).  In 
these cases, IBAMA must inform the Public Ministry and, alongside the administrative investigation, the 
criminal  prosecution  might  take  place.  Those  cases  correspond  to  25.9%  of  the  violations,  or  33,117 
records. Appendix B shows how criminal records in our dataset behave concerning recidivism. 
 

 

 

4.  Method11  

 
Survival Analysis is concerned with assessing the  expected span of time  of the occurrence of an 
event, or the amount of time until a failure (Cleves et al., 2004). In social sciences these methods are also 
called  “Duration  Analysis”.  In  our  case,  the  event  in  question  is  recidivism,  and  failure  denotes 
reoffending. According to Monnery (2013), since the seminal work of Schmidt and Witte (1989), a large 
amount  of  studies  employ  such  methods  instead  of  binary  or  linear  models  to  study  recidivism.  Our 
interest is, therefore, not only in the occurrence, or the probability of reoffending, but also when it takes 
place.  The  most  important  functions  in  the  analysis  are  the  Survival  Function, 𝑆(𝑡),  and  the  Hazard 
Function,  ℎ(𝑡),  where  𝑇 = 1, . . , 𝑡  is  a  non-negative  random  variable  denoting  time  to  failure.   𝑆(𝑡) 
denotes  the  probability  of  surviving  beyond  time  t  and    ℎ(𝑡)  is  the  instantaneous  rate  of  failure, 
conditional  on  having  survived  to  that  time  (Cleves  et  al.,  2004).  The  Hazard  Function,  along  with  the 
Cumulative Hazard Function12, 𝐻(𝑡), help to answer what is the risk – the intensity with which recidivism 
occurs - of the event at time 𝑡. According to Cleves et al. (2004), hazard functions give an easier way to 
understand how the co-variables affect the risk and the process that generates failure (reoffending). 

Traditionally, subjects are followed over time until  the first failure, and the observation on that 
individual  stops  at  that  point.  However,  in  our  case,  data  collection  does  not  stop  when  the  violator 
recidivates, and we consider the possibility of repeatable events, that is, multiple reoffences. We worked 
with longitudinal data on infringements in the span of 11 years and violators could join the study at any 
time, from 2000 to 2010. Also, we had access to the precise number of days between the subject’s first 
violation and the date of the following infractions, if any. Therefore, we dealt with repeated event models 
to  investigate  the  process  that  generates  recidivism.  The  large  time-span  and  number  of  events  of  our 
dataset, along with the “fail precision”, improve the consistency of our estimates and provide satisfactory 
statistical power.  

The  recurrent  event  analysis  with  multiple  co-variables  imposes  some  particularities.  Non-
parametric models13 do not provide effect estimates for multiple variables of interest. In that case, semi-
parametric14  or  parametric  models15  allow  for  the  analysis  of  recidivism  with  respect  to  our  focus 
variables  simultaneously,  which  is,  they  provide  estimates  for  the  effect  of  each  category  of  the 
processing status of infraction notices. Also, repeated event data is correlated thus we considered multiple 
recurrences  for  the  same  offender  (repeated  measures  for  an  individual).  Frailty  models,  which  account 
for unobservable heterogeneity or random effects (the violator’s own disposition to recidivate) consider 
the  presence  of  correlation  and  were  used  to  model  dependence  in  multi-variables  survival  data16.  The 
first  are  termed  “Unshared  Frailty  Models”  and  the  latter  are  referred  to  as  “Shared  Frailty  Models” 
(Cleves  et  al.,  2004).  We  assume  frailty  to  be  a  characteristic  of  the  infringer,  that  is,  frailty  is  not  a 
                                                           
11 The “Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health” provides and overview on survival analysis data, methods, and 
main questions, along  with a  comprehensive list of  further  readings.  This section is largely based on their  website. It can be 
accessed at https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/population-health-methods/time-event-data-analysis 
12 Usually, the relationship among these functions translates as: an increase/decrease in h(t) will lead to an increase/decrease in 
H(t), which translates into a decrease/increase in S(t). 
13  Nonparametric  approaches  do  not  rely  on  assumptions  about  the  parameters  in  the  underlying  population.  The  most  well-
known estimators are the Kaplan-Meier and the Nelson-Aalen (Kaplan and Meier, 1958, Aalen, 1978, Nelson, 1969, Nelson, 
1972). These methods are generally used to describe the data with respect to the factor under analysis by estimating S(t). 
14 The Cox Proportional model is the most commonly used multivariable semi-parametric approach in Duration Analysis. The 
model consists of a non-parametric element, represented by the baseline  hazard,  ℎ0(𝑡), and a parametric  module comprising 
the covariate vector, 𝑔(𝑋′𝛽). The proportional hazards (PH) hypothesis presumes that the covariate vector multiples ℎ0(𝑡) by 
the same amount regardless of time, that is, risk rates (hazard ratios) are proportional and constant among individuals for the 
entire period of analysis (Cox, 1972).  
15  In  parametric  models  the  distributions  of  the  covariate  vector  and  the  hazard  function  are  both  stipulated  based  on 
assumptions about the underlying population. In that case, the estimation of the baseline hazard is of interest. The PH approach 
can  also  assume  the  parametric  form.  Parametric  models,  when  correctly  specified,  are  more  efficient  and  have  more  power 
than semiparametric counterparts, providing smaller standard errors and more precise estimates (Cleves et al., 2004). The most 
frequently used distributions for the hazard function are: the Gompertz, the Exponential, and the Weibull. 
16 Vaupel et al. (1979) are among the firsts to suggest an individual random effects model for time-to-event analysis with the 
notion of frailty, meaning that subjects with shorter times to failure are more “frail” than others (Cleves et al, 2004; Gutierrez 
(2002). 

 

 

specific observation but  causes of violation for the same subject who are correlated. The Shared Frailty 
controls this latent individual effect.  

Therefore, frailty is shared at the violator level and can be assumed to follow either a gamma or 
inverse-gaussian distribution (Vaupel et al., 1979; Hougaard, 1984; Cleves et al., 2004). In this case, the 
hazard ratio’s17 interpretation will be conditional on frailty (Gutierrez, 2002). Therefore, ℎ(𝑡𝑖𝑗|𝑥𝑖𝑗, 𝛼𝑖) =
𝛼𝑖ℎ(𝑡𝑖𝑗|𝑥𝑖𝑗), for data consisting of 𝑛 groups, with the 𝑖th group comprised of 𝑛𝑖 observations. The index 𝑖 
denotes the offenders (𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛), and 𝑗 denotes the observation within groups, for 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑛𝑖 , where 
“group”  represents  a  single  subject  for  which  multiple  offense  episodes  may  be  observed,  𝛼𝑖  are  the 
individual frailties and 𝑡 is the time period (Cleves et al., 2004; Gutierrez, 2002).  

Therefore,  to  analyze  the  effect  of  processing  status  of  administrative  infraction  notices  on  the 
recidivist behavior from environmental violators we employed the semi-parametric approach of the Cox 
Proportional  Model,  the  parametric  versions  of  the  Proportional  Hazards  (PH)  Models  considering 
different  distributions  (Gompertz,  Exponential,  and  Weibull)18,  and  the  Shared  Frailty  Approach.  The 
Kaplan-Meier and the Nelson-Aalen non-parametric approaches are also presented as a form to describe 
the  data.  To  compare  models  run  with  different  parametric  forms,  we  use  the  Akaike  Information 
Criterion  (AIC)  and  the  Bayesian  Information  Criterion  (BIC).  Sensitivity  analysis  is  done  by  the 
evaluation of two measures: the pseudo R2 (Cox and Snell, 1989) and the Log-Pseudolikelihood. 

 
 

5.  Results 

 
In this section we will present the results of the application of survival  analysis models to assess 
the  effects  of  the  Brazilian  administrative  procedure  on  the  recidivism  of  environmental  violators.  The 
analysis is structured in two phases, the non-parametric analysis of Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen and 
the application of proportional risk models. 

 

Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier Survival function 

 

 

In order to illustrate failure time we chose to use the Kaplan-Meier Survival Graph, whereby one 
can  observe  how  individuals  experience  recurrence  over  time.  Figure  1  shows  that  the  probability  of 
survival  declined  by  approximately  30%  during  the  analyzed  period,  and  this  decrease  occurs  more 
sharply in the first quarter of the time analyzed. 

Table  3  presents  the  results  of  the  survival  function  given  by  Kaplan-Meier  non-parametric 

                                                           
17 In a simple form, HRs reflect the relationship between the instantaneous hazards for two groups of covariates, describing the 
differences in the relative hazard, and are often treated as a ratio between failure probabilities.  
18 The exponential distribution assumes that the hazard depends only on model coefficients and covariates and is constant over 
time. The Weibull distribution assumes a monotonic hazard that can either be increasing or decreasing. The Gompertz 
distribution is a PH model that is equal to the log-Weibull distribution, so the log of the hazard function is linear in t.

From Table 3 can be inferred that the value of the survival function decreases at decreasing rates 
over time. The value of  this function reflects  the probability of occurrence of recidivism not  happening 
until  a certain  period.  For the  first  year,  after the basic registration, 90.18% of the cases do not  present 
recurrence, for the second year this value decreases to 84.26% and in the third year to 80.49%, decreasing 
at ever lower rates until arriving in 66.63% for the eleventh year. 

Table 4 presents the results according to Nelson-Aalen's non-parametric estimation. Following the 
same structure as the previous table, in which the first column represents time, subdivided into categories, 
in the second and third column, the number of recurrences in the period and its cumulative number and

The value of the  accumulated risk function  grows at  decreasing rates over time. As the value of 
the  function  reflects  the  cumulative  risk  of  recidivism  after  a  certain  period.  For  the  first  year  after  the 
basic registration, the cumulative risk of recurrence is 10.33%, for the second year the cumulative risk is 
16.7%, this accumulated risk increases at ever lower rates until reaching 40.6% % for the eleventh year. 

Now,  if  we  look  at  Kaplan-Meier's  survival  function  for  the  categories  of  the  legal  process 
situation  (Figure  2).  Which  is,  the  procedural  situation  of  the  infraction  that  caused  the  entry  of  the 
individual  in  the  analysis  affects  the  function  of  recidivism  that  he  observes  for  the  next  periods.  In  all 
seven  categories  the  survival  function  is  decreasing  with  decreasing  rates  over  time  and  categories 
intensify this decrease. 

 

 

 

Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Survival function 

 

 
The lighter survival function is the base records categorized as CEO, and below it are the survival 
curves for the records categorized as QUI, SPA and PRE. These curves are close to each other. Registries 
categorized  as  TRA  and  IDA  present  near  survival  curves  and  slightly  above  the  survival  curve  for 
records categorized as CBS, which has its survival function with the highest intensity of decrease. Thus, 
the records categorized as CBS have a probability of experiencing the recidivism event close to 45%, in 
the half of the analyzed period, for those categorized as QUI, the probability falls close to 20%. 

It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  to  correctly  evaluate  the  effect  of  the  variables  of  the 
administrative  procedure  situation  on  the  risk  of  recidivism  of  infractions  against  the  environment  in 
Brazil  we  must  use  correctly  the  sample  that  we  have.  The  sample  is  structured  as  follows,  we  have 
multiple records per violators on failures that may happen repeatedly. In addition, co-variables of interest 
change  over  time.  Then,  with  this  "complex"  structure,  we  must  specify  strong  standard  errors  thus  the 
data follow the violator identity variable, and this implies in the estimation that clustering will be defined 
by  the  violator.  So,  all  estimates  consider  this  structure  for  analysis.  And  in  order  to  control  the 
heterogeneity  between  individuals  we  added  the  shared  fragility  component.  Therefore,  in  Table  5  we 
present  the  results  for  the  proportional  risk  (PH)  models  (Cox,  Gompertz,  Exponential  and  Weibull, 
respectively).  When  the  estimators  allow19  us  to  add  regressions  containing  both  the  shared  frailty  with 
the Gamma distribution and the shared frailty with the Inverse Gaussian distribution. The estimates were 
performed using all  control groups described in the data section. 

The coefficients presented in Table 5 should be interpreted as follows: when they are represented 
by  a  number  below  zero,  the  risk  of  recidivism  of  infraction  decreases.  In  contrast,  if  the  coefficient  is 
given by a number above zero, the risk of recurrence increases. As for the set of variables regarding the 
process status, the difference between their risk rates is obtained through their coefficients, and the basis 
of  comparison  between  them  is  the  QUI  variable.  To  derive  the  variation  on  the  risk  of  recidivism  we 
should  apply  the  exponential  to  the  estimated  value,  subtract  one  unit  and  multiply  by  100,  for  all 
coefficients found in Table 7. For example, consider the Cox semi-parametric model in the first column. 
In this model, the SPA variable has a coefficient of 0.153, so by applying the exponentiation to this value, 
we have 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝛽) = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(0,153) = 1,165, so the risk ratio for the SPA category in relation to the risk of QUI 
is 16.5% greater than that of the base variable. 

The  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  presents  a  negative  coefficient  for  the  CEO  variable  and 
positive  for  the  variables  SPA,  PRE,  IDA,  TRA  and  CBS.  These  positive  variables  are  statistically 
significant, the  first  at  least  10%  and the others  at  1% in  significance level.  In the parametric  model  of 
proportional risks with Gompertz distribution we have the negative coefficient for the CEO variable and 
positive  for  the  other  variables.  The  coefficients  of  SPA,  PRE,  IDA,  TRA  and  CBS  are  statistically

database. 

 

 

significant,  being  the  first  two  at  least  5%  and  the  other  at  1%.  Then,  the  model  with  Gompertz 
distribution and shared frailty with  Gamma distribution was estimated and, later, the model considering 
the shared fragility with Inverse Gaussian distribution. The coefficients of both models presented negative 
values in the CEO variable, and positive in the variables SPA, PRE, IDA, TRA, CBS. In both models, the 
coefficients  of  the  CEO  and  SPA  variables  were  not  significant,  while  for  the  others,  they  were 
statistically significant at least 1% significance level. 

We  follow  the  same  rationale  for  proportional  hazards  model  with  Exponential  distribution,  the 
coefficients  were  negative  for  the  CEO  variable  and  positive  for  the  SPA  variable,  the  first  being  not 
significant and the second significant with at least 10% of significance level. For the variables PRE, IDA, 
TRA, CBS the coefficients  are positive and significant  to  at  least  1% of significance level.  Considering 
the  frailty  shared  with  Gama  distribution  and  with  Inverse  Gaussian  distribution,  the  models  presented 
coefficients  with  negative  values  in  the  CEO  variable,  and  positive  in  the  variables  SPA,  PRE,  IDA, 
TRA, CBS. In both models, the coefficients of the CEO and SPA variables were not significant, while for 
the others, they were statistically significant at least 1% of significance level. 

Finally, we considered the parameterization with Weibull distribution. When frailty is disregarded, 
the  SPA  variable  is  significant  at  least  10%  confidence  level.  When  considering  the  shared  frailty,  for 
both models the coefficients presented negative values in the CEO and positive variables in the variables 
SPA, PRE, IDA, TRA, CBS, with the variables CEO and SPA not significant and the other coefficients 
significant at least 1% of significance. 

In  general,  we  can  conclude  that  the  variables  PRE,  IDA,  TRA  and  CBS  are  significant  in  all 
proportional risk models utilized. The coefficients appoints to the same direction, which means that they 
all  increase  the  risk  of  recidivism  of  the  violators.  The  selection  of  the  most  appropriate  model  is 
performed  by  the  AIC  and  BIC  criteria,  in  which  smaller  values  indicate  which  modeling  is  most 
appropriate.  The  model  selected  by  these  criteria  is  the  Weibull  with  Inverse  Gaussian  Shared  Frailty. 
This model presents the lowest values for both criteria, which are respectively: 71245.2 and 71775.9. In 
addition, the LR statistic referring to the theta parameter indicates rejection of the null hypothesis, so the 
unobserved heterogeneity is statistically significant at 1% of confidence and should be considered. 

The  parametric  model  of  proportional  hazards  with  Weibull  distribution  and  shared  Inverse 
Gaussian  frailty  shows  that  PRE,  IDA,  TRA  and  CBS  significantly  affect  the  risk  of  recidivism  of 
infringements against the environment. The results indicate that the components of the law enforcement 
process increase the risk of recidivism of violators against the environment. The highest risk of recidivism 
occurs when the process is  extinguished (CBS),  with  effect  of approximately 79.9%. The second  major 
effect  on  the  risk  of  recidivism  occurs  when  the  legal  process  is  prescribed  (PRE),  with  effect  of 
approximately  33.4%.  The  fact  that  the  process  is  recorded  in  the  active  debt  increases  the  risk  of 
recurrence by approximately 29.7%. Finally, the fact that the proceeding remains in progress increases the 
risk of recidivism by approximately 29.1%. 

These  results  suggest  that  both  the  delays  in  the  legal  process  and  the  eventual  ability  of  the 
offender to be assisted by lawyers who can extend the process in court, possibly resulting in cancellation 
or  limitation,  increase  the  risk  of  recidivism  of  these  offenders  against  the  environment.  Therefore, 
institutional policies that stimulate both the settlement of fines and acceleration of the judgments would 
reduce the risk of recidivism of environmental infractions in Brazil.

6.  Sensitivity Analysis 

 

In this section we analyze the sensitivity of the coefficients of the parametric model of 
proportional hazards with Weibull distribution and shared Gaussian inverse frailty. The Table 
6 presents ten different strategies for this parametric model. The first modeling considers only 
the variables of interest and disregards all controls.  

The results of this strategy are reported in column (01) and indicate that all variables 
of  interest  are  statistically  significant,  CEO,  PRE  IDA  TRA  and  CBS  at  1%  level  of 
significance,  while  SPA  is  significant  at  5%  confidence.  The  magnitudes  of  the  coefficients 
are  close  to  those  found  in  the  previous  section.  The  largest  difference  occurs  in  the 
significance  of  the  CEO  and  SPA  variables.  The  first  indicates  that  the  conversion  of  the 
process  into  other  sanctions  reduces  the  chance  of  recidivism  by  approximately  30.8%.  The 
debt installment would increase the risk by approximately 15.3%. 

The estimation (02) considers as control in the empirical model only the variable that 
characterizes if the infraction is considered a crime. The results remain close to those of the 
estimation  (01).  In  addition,  in  the estimation  (03) is  added the  group of  controls  associated 
with  the characteristics of the violators (Control Group 1), and the  statistical  significance of 
the CEO variable is lost, the magnitudes of the coefficients associated with SPA and PRE are 
close to those found previously.  

In  the  estimation  (04)  the  municipal  characteristics  of  monitoring  and  facing 
environmental infractions are considered (Control Group 2), and the coefficients also remain 
close to those of the previous equations. Following this logic, subsequent estimates consider, 
respectively,  controls  of  geographical  characteristics  (Control  Group  3),  agricultural 
production  and  burnings  (Control  Group  4),  socioeconomic  variables  (Control  Group  5), 
institutional aspects (Control Group 6) and other municipal characteristics (Control Group 7). 
Even  so,  the  magnitudes  of  the  variables  of  interest  remain  statistically  significant  and  with 
magnitudes close to each other.  

It  should  be  noted  that  in  the  estimations  of  (03)  to  (09)  the  effect  of  the  debt 
installment  increases  the  risk  of  recurrence  by  approximately  27.6%.  When  we  add  the  last 
group  of  controls  related  to  local  expenditures  on  environmental  control  (Control  Group  8), 
the debt repayment loses statistical significance. But the variables PRE, IDA, TRA, and CBS 
remain strongly significant, with coefficients close to those previously found. 

The analysis of column (10) is the same found in the previous section. From Table 6, 
we can assess that when the control group 8 is added in the analysis, the estimate (10) has its 
sample  reduced  to  69582.  This  is  due  to  missing  data  in  the  controls  regarding  local 
expenditures  on  environmental  control.  Even  with  a  smaller  sample  size,  the  value  for  the 
Log-Pseudolikelihood  in  (10)  was  the  largest  among  the  estimates  in  Table  8,  that  is,  -
35564.6. In addition, the highest value of Cox & Snell's Pseudo R-Squared is also that of the 
estimation (10), with 0.114. Then, we can conclude that specification (10) presents the best fit 
for the model. In addition, the LR test indicates that consideration of heterogeneity is required 
in all estimated models, therefore shared frailty must be considered for correct inference. 

The  purpose  of  this  article  was  to  analyze  the  effect  of  the  Brazilian  administrative 
procedure on the recidivist behavior of environmental offenders. The results were  robust for 
all estimation strategies in Table 8, showing that the coefficients were not significant due to 
chance,  nor  were  their  magnitudes  influenced  by  the  strategy  used.  Thus,  we  are  confident 
about the results found.

7.  Conclusions 

 

This  work  aimed  at  analyzing  the  effects  of  the  Brazilian  administrative  law 
enforcement procedure on the recidivist behavior of environmental violators. We focused on 
the legal processing of administrative infractions registered by IBAMA, with emphasis on the 
payment status of the fines imposed by the agency. Additionally, we considered as controls a 
large  set  of  variables  related 
the  possibility  of  criminal  prosecution,  offender 
characteristics,  local  environmental  monitoring,  and  socioeconomic,  geographical,  and 
institutional aspects of the municipality where the infraction took place. 

to 

This paper contributes to the international literature on environmental enforcement, on 
the rarely addressed subject of recidivism. As seen, data on this topic is almost inexistent and 
most studies work with restrict datasets, accompanying a limited number of infringements for 
a specific region during a short period of time. We are the first to provide empirical evidence 
for  a  large  database  disaggregated  at  the  individual  level,  spanning  the  whole  Brazilian 
Federation, spanning for several years. In this sense, we provide new and robust evidence on 
the  enforcement  effects  of  the  environmental  law,  considering  the  processing  status  of 
administrative  violation  records.  Therefore,  this  research  fits  in  the  field  of  Empirical  Law 
and Economics.  

Evidence  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  enforcement  efforts  in  Brazil  is  mingled. 
Some  studies  point  that  administrative  fines  are  essential  to  discourage  deforestation  and 
further  environmental  offenses,  while  others  emphasize 
impunity  favors  new 
infringements insofar that IBAMA fails to comply with legal deadlines, processing times are 
too  long,  and  favor  the  incidence  of  statutory  limitations  as  fines  are  seldom  collected 
(Barreto  and  Mesquita,  2009;  Assunção  et  al.,  2013;  Uhr  and  Uhr,  2014;  Da  Silva  and 
Bernard, 2016; Garcia and Fonseca, 2018; Uhr et al., 2018). 

that 

Our results show that the delays in the legal process do increase the risk of recidivism 
of these offenders against the environment. That is, the results indicate that the highest risk of 
recidivism  occurs  when  the  process  is  extinguished.  The  second  major  effect  on  the  risk  of 
recidivism  occurs  when  the  legal  process  is  subjected  to  statutory  limitations.  Thirdly,  fact 
that  the  process  is  placed  in  the  official  active  debtors  list  of  the  state,  and,  finally,  the  fact 
that  the  proceeding  takes  too  much  time  to  be  concluded.  Therefore,  we  highlight  that 
IBAMA has a low capacity to guarantee compliance to environmental standards, particularly 
when  it  comes  to  recurrence.  As  shown,  even  if  the  efficiency  of  the  Institute  in  collecting 
fines is increasing (IBAMA, 2010), 60% of offense records in the analyzed period were still 
not sanctioned in a span of a minimum of six years (supposing that the infringement occurred 
in  2010).  Souza  (2016)  points  that  increasing  the  collection  of  sanction  charges  is  the  main 
issue for improving law enforcement. 

Future  researches  could  test the hypothesis  that treating repeat offenders  more harshly 
encourages  compliance  or  if  such  remedy  is  inefficient  due  to  higher  obedience  costs.  Our 
dataset shows that the sanction fine is significantly higher for recidivists (2,6 times) than for 
non-recidivists, as is the percentage of offenders facing the possibility of criminal prosecution 
(from  23%  to  31%).  However,  the  percentage  of  fines  paid,  with  debt  in  installments  or 
converted  into  warnings  or  lesser  punishments,  is  considerably  lower  for  the  group  with 
repeated  violations  (dropping  from  51%  to  31%).  On  the  other  hand,  categories  favoring 
impunity, such as assessments in progress and extinguished, suspended, or deleted cases, rise 
from  43%  to  57%.  Such  evidence  seems  to  favor  the  hypothesis  of  high  compliance  costs 
regarding environmental law in a Federal level.
