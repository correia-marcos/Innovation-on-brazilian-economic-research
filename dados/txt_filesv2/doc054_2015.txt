Abstract  

There  are  a  studies  suggesting  that  inequalities  in  human  capital  emerge  from  differences  in  endowments. 
Characteristics  of  health  and  cognitive  abilities  determined  before  human  capital  accumulation  process 
exemplify  these  endowments.  The  consequences  of  impairments  in  endowments  can  be  mitigated  or 
exacerbated  through  parental  investment.  A  classic  model  of  intra-family  resource  allocation  predicts  that 
worse endowments discourage parental investment due to the lower returns to investment in human capital. 
At the same time, poor environmental conditions in utero have been shown to have adverse consequences on 
these endowments. Weather conditions, for instance, are a potential negative influence in utero. Motivated by 
these  considerations,  we  examine  the  effects  of  early  exposure  to  heat  waves  on  parental  investment  in 
human capital. We do so in the context of Colombia by using a within-municipality identification strategy. 
Our results indicate that in utero exposure to heat waves has negative effects on parental investments in child 
health care and schooling.  Our preferred interpretation  of these results is that early  exposure to  heat  waves 
negatively  affected  individual  endowments  and,  therefore,  the  returns  to  investment  in  human  capital 
decreased. As a result, families responded by reallocating resources.

Resumo 

Estudos  recentes  sugerem  que  as  variações  dessas  capacidades  decorrem  das  diferenças  individuais  nas 
dotações  iniciais.  Características  de  saúde  e  de  habilidades  cognitivas  determinadas  antes  do  processo  de 
formação de capital humano exemplificam tais dotações. As conseqüências na formação de capital humano 
de  deterioras  nessas    dotações  podem  ser  mitigadas  ou  exacerbadas  através  do  investimento  dos  pais.  Um 
modelo clássico de alocação de recursos sugere que piores dotações iniciais desestimulam o investimento em 
devido  a  que  o  retorno  do  investimento  em  capital  humano  diminui.  Ao  mesmo  tempo,  tem  sido 
documentado  que  pobres  condições  ambientais  no  útero  trazem  conseqüências  adversas  sobre  as  dotações 
individuais. Os eventos climáticos extremos, por exemplo, é uma potencial negativa influência das condições 
no  útero.  Motivados  por  essas  considerações,  este  estudo  examina  o  efeito  da  exposição  no  útero  a 
temperaturas extremas de calor sobre os investimentos dos pais em capital humano no contexto da Colômbia. 
Usa-se uma estratégia de identificação que explora variações aleatórias na temperatura de cada município. Os 
resultados indicam que a exposição no útero a ondas de calor tem efeitos negativos sobre o investimento em 
cuidado de saúde e educação. A interpretação preferida desses resultados é que a exposição no útero a ondas 
de calor afetou negativamente as dotações dos indivíduos e, como conseqüência, os retornos ao investimento 
em capital humano diminuíram. Como um resultado, as famílias responderam realocando os recursos.

1.  Introduction 

 

Individual capabilities are an important determinant of human capital. Recent studies suggest that inequalities 
in  capabilities  emerge  from  differences  in  endowments.  Characteristics  of  health  and  cognitive  and  non-
cognitive  abilities  determined  before  human  capital  accumulation  process  exemplify  these  endowments 
(CUNHA;  HECKMAN,  2008, 2009). The human capital  consequences of  impairments in  endowments can 
be mitigated or exacerbated through parental investment. Becker and Lewis (1973)’s seminal study suggests 
that  worse  endowments  discourage  parental  investment  due  to  the  lower  returns  to  investment  in  human 
capital. At the same time, a literature argues that birth outcomes are closely related to these endowments. For 
example,  it  has  been  documented  that  low  birth  weight  children  are  likely  to  have  brain  damage  and 
impairments  in  the  growth  of  brain  structures  related  to  learning  (ABERNETHY;  PALANIAPPAN; 
COOKE,  2002;  HACK;  KLEIN;  TAYLOR,  1995).  Along  these  lines,  exposure  to  poor  environmental 
conditions  in  utero  has  been  shown  to  have  adverse  consequences  on  birth  outcomes  (ALMOND,  2006; 
BARRECA, 2010; CURRIE; ROSSIN-SLATER, 2013). 

Altogether,  these  facts  suggest  that  weather  shocks  could  have  long-term  impacts  on  human  capital 
accumulation  of  cohorts  exposed  prenatally  during  these  periods.  Episodes  of  high  temperatures  can 
adversely  affect  birth  outcomes,  thereby  affecting  endowments  through  changes  in  disease  environment, 
agricultural activity, and maternal stress. Heat waves may favor the survival of vectors that transmit diseases 
such  as  malaria,  which  can  harm  the  fetus  through  direct  transmission  from  the  mother  and/or  oxygen 
deprivation associated with anemia (CRIMMINS; FINCH, 2006). In addition, episodes of high temperatures 
can  adversely  affect  agricultural  production  and,  in  turn,  lead  to  inadequate  nutrition  due  to  lower  food 
production and less variety of diets. Furthermore, a pregnant woman may be more susceptible to heat stress 
(STRAND; BARNETT; TONG, 2012; WELLS; COLE, 2002). And stress has been linked with increases in 
levels of hormones that regulate growth and development of the fetus (WADHWA et al., 1993). As a result, 
prenatal exposure to  heat  waves potentially  affect  parental investment  in human  capital  through changes in 
individual endowments. 

While there are studies  that  evaluate  the effects  of different  prenatal environments  on investment in 
human  capital  (ADHVARYU;  NYSHADHAM,  2014;  BARRECA,  2010),  there  has  been  little  systematic 
research on the effects of early weather conditions. Understanding the effects of weather shocks is important 
in  view of projections indicating that the annual  temperature will increase in  the next  decades due to  man-
made pollution, making more frequent extreme weather episodes  (IPCC, 2007). Therefore, estimates of the 
effects of early exposure to heat waves may be of particular interest to policy makers. 

In this study, we examine the effects of early exposure to heat waves on parental investment in human 
capital. We do so in the context of Colombia by using a within-municipality identification strategy. Colombia 
is  a  country  with  a  temperature  that  varies  widely  through  short  periods  of  time  and  has  been  the  World’s 
third most hit country by weather-related losses (CATARIOUS; ESPACH, 2009; GERMANWATCH, 2011). 
In  particular,  Colombia  is  exposed  to  El  Niño  and  La  Niña,  which  are  weather  events  that  take  place,  on 
average, every four years and cause episodes of extreme temperatures.  Some projections suggest that in the 
coming decades, weather events will affect 8 out of 10 Colombians living in vulnerable areas (CATARIOUS; 
ESPACH, 2009).   

Our approach for discerning the impacts of temperature from unobserved influences is based on three 
main components. First, we use high frequency information in order to build a weather dataset, which can be 
linked to microdata by using date and place of birth. Second, we use temporary temperature deviations from 
historical  averages  to  limit  the  influence  of  unobservables  co-varying  with  temperature  levels.  Third,  we 
2 

 

 
control  by  a  full  set  of  municipality,  month,  and  year  fixed-effects  in  order  to  account  for  time  invariant 
characteristics, aggregate shocks, and seasonal factors that might be related to temperature shocks. Thus, our 
approach  exploits  random  fluctuations  in  temperature  from  municipality-specific  deviations  in  temperature 
after controlling for all seasonal factors and common shocks to all municipalities.  

 

We  start  showing  evidence  of  the  effects  of  heat  waves  on  birth  outcomes.  Using  natality  data,  we 
find  that  increases  in  temperature  are  associated  with  poorer  birth  outcomes.  Specifically,  we  find  that 
exposure to heat waves in the first trimester of pregnancy reduces the Apgar score and increases the risk of 
low  birth  weight.  Our  main  results  focus  on  the  effects  of  early  temperature  conditions  on  parental 
investments. Using census data, we find adverse effects on investment in child health care and schooling. In 
particular,  an  increase  of  one  standard  deviation  in  temperature  during  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  is 
associated with a 1.8% reduction in the likelihood of pre-school attendance.  

Our  favorite  interpretation  of  these  results  is  that,  given  constant  returns  to  child  quality,  worse 
endowments involve negative externalities on the ability of parents to invest in human capital. But we find 
this  is  not  all  that  is  going  on.  Rather,  early  exposure  to  temperature  shocks  changed  the  returns  to  child 
quality  and  families  responded  by  reallocating  resources.  This  interpretation  is  made  somewhat  more 
plausible by the results in the previous studies documenting a positive intra-family correlation between initial 
endowments  and  parental 
(ALMOND;  MAZUMDER,  2013;  DATAR;  KILBURN; 
LOUGHRAN, 2010;  ROSALES-RUEDA, 2014), and by our results.  In particular, a possible interpretation 
of our findings is that early temperature shocks impair cognitive abilities and this increases the cost of child 
quality, which, in turn, leads to disincentives to invest in human capital. 

investments 

We  should  recognize  that  there  are  several  threats  to  the  validity  of  our  conclusions.  First,  there  is 
evidence  documenting  that  temperature  increases  result  in  declines  in  economic  activity,  even  in  non-
agricultural  sectors,  which  could  reduce  wages  and/or  employment  (DELL;  JONES;  OLKEN,  2012). 
Therefore,  one  possibility  is  that  our  results  are  reflecting  a  persistent  decline  in  family  income  which 
negatively  affected  human  capital  investment.  Since  the  drop  in  income  is  caused  by  temperature  shocks, 
their  omission  does  not  introduce  a  bias  in  our  estimates  per  se,  but  rather  affects  the  interpretation  of  the 
estimated  relationship.  Thus,  in  the  presence  of  persistent  falls  in  income,  the  effect  of  weather  shocks  on 
investment  in  human  capital  cannot  be  attributed  only  to  variations  in  individual  endowments.  But  if  the 
persistent fall in income plays a key role in explaining our results, then we should see that the parental time-
intensive investment should increase for children exposed to heat waves in utero as a result of lower value of 
time,  as  suggested  by  the  findings  of  Miller  and  Urdinola  (2010).  In  general,  the  use  of  health  services  in 
Colombia  is  cheap  or  free  but  requires  a  considerable  amount  of  time.  However,  we  find  that  parental 
investment  in  child  care  not  only  not  increase,  but  decrease.  In  addition,  we  also  do  not  find  that  early 
temperature  conditions  negatively  affected  maternal  labor  supply,  which  is  not  consistent  with  persistent 
reductions  in  value  of  time.  As  an  exploratory  analysis,  we  examine  the  relationship  between  early 
temperature  conditions  and  parental  investment  including  a  proxy  variable  of  shocks  in  local  economic 
activity  to  investigate  the  role  of  persistent  drop  in  income.  All  our  estimates  remain  unaffected  when  we 
control  for  such  proxy  variable.  Although  we  cannot  completely  rule  out  the  possibility  that  persistent 
changes in  income play  a role, the evidence suggests that they  are not  the main mechanism explaining our 
results. 

Second, it could be argued that our results reflect changes in the composition of births. For example, a 
possibility is that families mitigate temperature shocks by migrating and families who  make these decisions 
have  higher  socio-economic  status.  Thus,  our  results  may  reflect  the  fact  that  less  educated  mothers,  on 
average, are exposed to  higher temperature and they tend to invest less in their children regardless of early 

 

3 

 
weather conditions. To address this issue, we investigate if maternal characteristics, such as age or schooling, 
are related to early temperature conditions. We find no evidence that temperature predicts systematic changes 
in maternal characteristics, suggesting that there are no compositional changes in births. 

 

Third, it could be argued that heat waves increase the rate of fetal death. If those weaker fetuses are 
the most likely to die, then our regressions samples would be based on a select  group of “healthy” infants. 
Any  selection  bias  that  results  from  using  this  select  group  will  likely  lead  to  an  underestimate  of  the  true 
effect  of  early  temperature  shocks.  We  show  that  the  number  of  births  does  not  systematically  vary  with 
temperature  shocks,  suggesting  that  such  a  selection  bias  is  not  present.  As  an  additional  exercise,  we 
investigate whether temperature shocks affect the sex ratio. This provides a way of assessing the presence of 
fetal selection bias in view of literature suggesting that poor conditions in utero has worse consequences on 
the male fetuses  (ALMOND;  MAZUMDER,  2011;  ERIKSSON et  al., 2010;  KRAEMER, 2000). Hence, if 
there is any fetal selection bias we should observe that increases in temperature lower the sex ratio in favor of 
the  girls.  Our  results  show  no  evidence  supporting  a  statistically  significant  relationship  between  sex  ratio 
and temperature shocks. 

Our  study  is  related  to  literature  that  evaluates  the  importance  of  poor  environmental  conditions  in 
utero  on  parental  investment.  Using  the  introduction  of  malaria  eradication  programs  in  Mexico, 
Venkataramani  (2012)  found  that  individuals  with  lower  in  utero  exposure  to  malaria  started  school  at  an 
earlier age. Adhvaryu and Nyshadham (2014) show that an iodine supplement program during pregnancy in 
Tanzania  increased  breastfeeding  duration  and  vaccinations  among  children.  Almond,  Edlund,  and  Palme 
(2009)  study  the  effects  of  radioactive  fallout  caused  by  the  Chernobyl  accident  in  Switzerland  and  also 
provide indirect evidence that the investment in human capital decreased. Parman (2013) finds that exposure 
in utero to the 1918 influenza pandemic implied less investment in schooling.  

Our  study  makes  a  few  contributions  to  this  literature.  First,  we  see  our  study  as  a  first  attempt  to 
show the systematic importance of early weather conditions on human capital investments. Most of previous 
studies  have  investigated  the  influence  of  unique  and  uncommon  historical  events  and  the  validity  of  its 
conclusions to the world today may be questionable. In contrast, the Earth’s climate is expected to  become 
hotter  in  the  near  future,  which  would  increase  the  frequency  of  heat  extreme  episodes.  Second,  we  use  a 
broader  set  of  parental  investment  measures.  Most  of  previous  studies  use  limited  measures  or  rely  on 
indirect  evidence.  For  example,  Almond,  Edlund,  and  Palme  (2009)  argue  that  parents  adopt  reinforcing 
strategies because the effect of fetal exposure to the radioactive fallout on cognitive skills was greater in poor 
families.  This  evidence  is  compelling,  but  it  turns  out  to  be  only  suggestive.  In  contrast,  we  use  direct 
measures of parental investment such as pre-school attendance and childcare. Third, we also offer interesting 
new evidence of potential mechanisms. In particular, we investigate whether prenatal exposure to heat waves 
involves  changes  in  fertility  decisions.  This  is  important  given  that  families  with  unhealthy  children  could 
change their future demand for children (SCHULTZ, 1997), which would affect investment in child quality 
as  predicted  by  the  quantity-quality  model  of  fertility  (BECKER;  LEWIS,  1973).  Therefore,  if  there  are 
significant  effects  on  fertility,  this  would  be  supportive  evidence  that  variations  in  endowments  involve 
externalities in the ability of parents to invest in human capital. 

The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  The  next  section  presents  a  simple  framework 
that  explains  the  relationship  between  individual  endowments  and  parental  investment.  The  third  section 
describes the data used. The fourth presents the econometric model. The fifth section presents the results. The 
sixth section presents an overview of the results of several exercise of robustness. Finally, the seventh section 
concludes.

2.  Framework 

 

To  illustrate  how  the  early  temperature  conditions  could  affect  parental  investment  in  human  capital,  the 
human capabilities formation model developed by Heckman (2007) and Cunha and Heckman (2007) can be 
used.  The  model  argues  that  early  individual  endowments  and  parental  investment  interact  and  it  defines 
human capital formation. Parents can offset or reinforce a shock that affected the initial endowments through 
investment in human capital. To formalize this, we assume two periods (pre-natal and post-natal) and use the 
following capabilities’ production function:  

ℎ = 𝐴ℎ(𝐼) 

where h is a measure of human capital formation, and I the parental investment during the post-natal period4. 
The term A represents a productivity factor that is directly related to the innate endowments of individuals. 
This implies that the investment would have a larger effect on the formation of human capital in  either the 
most  productive  or  the  best  endowed  individuals,  a  feature  that  is  known  as  “complementary  dynamics”. 
Another  implication  of  this  production  function  is  that  the  initial  endowments  can  have  a  direct  effect, 
individuals with more initial skills accumulate more human capital given constant levels of investment. This 
second feature is known as “self-productivity”. Thus, this function production has all the properties discussed 
in Heckman (2007).  

For this study’s proposals, we assume that the first-period exposure to heat waves has negative effects on 
the  initial  endowments  and  parents  see  such  endowments.  The  optimization  problem  of  parents  consists  in 
distributing resources on investment in human capital and the consumption of other goods. The parents are 
altruist and their utility increases with higher levels of h. Then, worse initial endowments as a consequence of 
a  pre-natal  shock  caused  by  heat  stress  implies  a  reduction  in  the  returns  to  investments.  As  a  result,  the 
optimal strategy would be to increase consumption in other  assets and reduce investment in human capital. 
Therefore, this simple model predicts that parents would adopt reinforcement strategies if temperature shocks 
negatively affect initial endowments. This prediction is consistent with Becker and Tomes (1973)’s model.  

3.  Data 

3.1.Weather Data 

We use monthly temperature and precipitation data provided by Matsuura and Willmott (2012). This dataset 
provides  estimates  of  climate  around  the  world  at  a  level  of  about  56x56  kilometers.  These  estimates  are 
based  on  information  collected  from  several  nearby  weather  stations.  The  data  provided  geographical 
coordinates  that  identify  the  spatial  location  of  weather  information.  Weather  information  is  provided  for 
each  of  these  coordinates  or  nodes,  constituting  a  monthly  series  for  the  period  1900-2010.  In  order  to 
construct a municipality-by-month of weather panel over this period, we use a strategy similar to Rocha and 
Soares  (2015).  To  start  with,  we  compute  the  centroid  for  each  municipality.  Then,  using  the  centroid  for 
each of these municipalities, we located the four nearest nodes. Thus, we build monthly series of temperature 
and precipitation for each municipality as the weighted average of estimates related to the four nodes. We use 
the  inverse  of  the  distance  of  each  municipality  to  each  of  the  four  nodes  as  weights.  This  information  is 
merged with the microdata described in the next section.   

                                                           
4We  assume  that  investment  in  prenatal  period  is  irrelevant  compared  to  the  postnatal  period  in  monetary  terms.  In  order  to 
maintain  simplicity,  we  assume  that  the  production  function  contains  only  the  postnatal  investment.  We  also  assume  that  h  is  a 
strictly concave in I, indicating that there are diminishing marginal returns on postnatal investments.  

5 

 

 

We  build  our  measure  of  temperature  fluctuations  for  the  municipality  j,  month  m  and  year  t,  as 

 

follows: 

 

𝑇𝑗𝑚𝑡 =

                       
𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑗𝑚𝑡 −𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑗𝑚

𝑠𝑑 (𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑗𝑚 )

                                   (1) 

This measure indicates how many standard deviations the temperature is above (or below) the historical 
average for a given municipality and point in time. We calculate the historical mean and standard deviation 
for each municipality using information from the  

period 1900-2010. Our measures of prenatal exposure to temperature changes during the q trimester for each 
individual are calculated as follows: 

3𝑞

𝑇𝑗𝑞       =     𝑇𝑗𝛤

  3   

𝛤=3𝑞−2

where 𝛤 corresponds to the months of gestation. This calculation assumes that individuals were nine months 
in  utero.  Thus,  the  use  of  this  variable  would  lead  to  a  measurement  error  in  exposure  of  individuals  who 
were born prematurely. Our main response to this concern is that to the extent that this measurement error is 
important, it will lead to a downward bias in the effect of temperature changes. If it is so, our results showing 
large  impacts  would  become  even  more  telling.  As  a  robustness  analysis,  we  estimate  the  impact  of 
temperature changes on birth outcomes using the sample including all infants and a subsample that excludes 
premature births. 

Figure  1  shows  the  evolution  of  standardized  temperature  for  the  period  1995-2010.  The  figure  shows 
that the temperature varies widely over time. The years with highest temperature are 1998 and 2010.It is also 
observed that the temperature is almost never below one standard deviation from the historical average, while 
periods  of  heat  waves  are  more  frequent.  Figure  2  shows  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  incidence  of  heat 
waves (defined as 1.5 standard deviations above the historical average). The figure shows that the incidence 
of  high  temperatures  also  varies  significantly  across  municipalities.  Episodes  of  extreme  heat  occur,  on 
average,  in  10%  of  the  Colombian  municipalities.  Yet,  there  are  periods  with  pervasive  heat  waves  hitting 
almost 80% of the municipalities and periods with no municipality experiencing a heat wave.    

3.1. Natality Files 

The  Colombian  Department  of  Statistics  (DANE)  is  the  source  of  the  birth  certificate  microdata  which  are 
publicly available from  2009. We obtained these data for 2009  and 2010 within the 1120 municipalities in 
Colombia-  approximately  1.4  million  birth  records.  The  data  include  the  exact  date  of  birth,  duration  of 
pregnancy,  sex,  birth  weight,  Apgar 5 scores  and  maternal  characteristics  such  as  marital  status,  age  and 
education.  Importantly,  the  information  about  municipality  of  residence  is  also  provided.  The  sample  is 
limited to births that were certified by a physician, which implies a reduction of about 2%. We also dropped 
the 269,642 births with either less than 37 weeks gestation or missing gestation information. The final sample 
consists  of  about  1,057,912  births.  The  dependent  variables  of  interest  are  5  minute  Apgar  score,  low  5 
minute Apgar score (<8), and low birth-weight (≤2,500 gr.). Using the municipality of residence of mother 

                                                           
5 The Apgar test is a clinical test that is given to the newborn in which five parameters are assessed. The parameters evaluated are 
muscle tone, respiratory effort, heart rate, reflexes and skin color. The test provides a total score between 0 and 10, where a higher 
score means healthier.

and  date  of  birth,  we  merge  these  data  with  our  weather  database.  Thus,  we  identify  prenatal  exposure  to 
temperature changes for each infant who was conceived between 2008 and 2010. Table 1 shows a statistical 
summary of the birth data. 

 

The  short  period  of  study  raises  some  concerns  about  the  variation  in  the  prenatal  exposure  to 
temperature.  However,  this  has  little  empirical  support.  Indeed,  there  is  substantial  variation  over  time  and 
space  in  that  short  window  of  time.  Figure  3  shows  that  while  in  most  months  of  2008  the  temperature  is 
located practically in its historical average, from 2009 it is placed between 2 and 4 standard deviations above 
it. In fact, there are months in which temperature is placed nearly 4 standard deviations above the historical 
average. The figure also shows that these changes were heterogeneous across municipalities. For example, in 
the first months of 2010 there are municipalities where the temperature is at about 1 standard deviation above 
average,  while  in  others  it  is  at  almost  4  standard  deviations  above.  This  suggests  that  there  is  substantial 
variation in that narrow window of time, which allows us to assess the effects of temperature shocks.      

3.2.Demography and Health Surveys 

To  evaluate  the  effects  of  early  weather  conditions  on  investment,  we  use  the  Colombian  Demography 
Health  Survey  (DHS),  which  is  a  nationally  representative  survey  of  women  of  childbearing  age  and  is 
conducted every five years from 1986. We use the DHS of 2005 and 2010 because, with the exception of the 
DHS  1990,  the  DHS  of  previous  years  do  not  provide  information  about  the  municipality  of  residence. 
Without  this  information  we  are  unable  to  identify  pre-natal  exposure  to  temperature  fluctuations.  Our 
sample consists of 31,557 children born between 1999 and 2010. This survey provides information about the 
exact date of birth, but the municipality of birth is not directly known. But the survey provides information 
on the years of residence in the current municipality. From this information, we can identify children born in 
the  current  municipality  of  residence.  Limiting  the  sample  to  these  children  implies  a  loss  of  13%  in  the 
number of observations. We also dropped 536 dead children at the time of the survey. We also eliminated to 
2,860 children who are less than 6 months old. The size of our basic sample consists of 23,790 observations, 
but it varies across estimations because there are variables with missing values. 

This  survey  allows  us  to  study  two  types  of  parental  investment  measures:  health  care  and 
development activities. As measures of health care, we use breastfeeding duration and vaccinations. To study 
breastfeeding, we focus on children over two years old. Most of the children in this group have completed or 
is  not  breastfeeding.  This  variable  is  subject  to  measurement  error  because  it  is  based  on  retrospective 
information.  Our  identification  strategy  requires  that  this  measurement  error  is  uncorrelated  with  pre-natal 
temperature exposure. This seems plausible.  

We constructed dummies indicating vaccination status for each of the following variables: hepatitis B, 
DPT, polio and measles. For hepatitis B, we created a dummy variable indicating whether a child received 
the third dose, which is expected to be received between 6 and 18 months of age. For DPT and polio, we use 
created dummies indicating whether a child received the second or third doses. The DPT doses are expected 
to be received between six and eighteen months of age, while polio doses are expected in children between 4 
and  18  months  of  age.  For  measles,  we  create  a  binary  variable  equal  to  one  if  the  child  received  the  first 
dose, which is expected to be received between 12 and 15 months old. The models using the measles vaccine 
status as the dependent variable excludes children who are under the age of twelve months. 

The  variables  regarding  development  activities  are  available  only  in  the  2010  DHS.  One  perhaps 
more appropriate measure would be the time spent on these activities, as in Hsin (2012). However, DHS does 
not  provide  this  information  and,  therefore,  we  are  limited  to  examine  whether  parents  do  or  not  these

activities.  We  use  dummy  variables  for  playing,  walking,  reading,  and  singing  activities  (see  Table  2  for 
summary of data).  

 

3.3.Census 2005 

To investigate the potential effects of early temperature shocks on parental investment in education, we use 
microdata  from  the  2005  census.  The  Integrated  Public  Use  Microdata  Series  (IPUMS)  provides  a  one 
percent  sample  for  2005.  Data  on  month,  year  and  place  of  birth  of  individuals  are  provided.  However, 
IPUMS re-classified birthplace in blocks of municipalities. For example, Ebejico, St. Jerome, and Sopetran 
municipalities represent a block. Thus, the 1120 Colombian municipalities are classified in about 533 blocks, 
indicating that on average a block contains two municipalities. Given this, we can identify only the block of 
birth and not the municipality. To link this information with our weather data, we build a block-by-month of 
weather panel over the period 1900-2005. These data were merged using the date and block of birth6.   

From  census  data,  we  use  two  measures  of  parental  investment.  The  first  is  a  dummy  variable 
indicating  pre-school  attendance  for  a  child  between  three  and  six  years  of  age.  The  second  is  a  dummy 
variable indicating whether a child between 7 and 9  years old never went to school. The reasoning for this 
variable is that children who never went to school receive less investment in education. We focus on this age 
group because in Colombia the minimum school age is six years. We do not include older children because 
the decision to go to school is more likely to depend on them. We also study the effects of pre-natal exposure 
to temperature shocks on human capital formation using IPUMS. With this in mind, we use illiteracy status 
and education years for children between seven and nine years of age. 

From  census  data,  we  study  two  additional  variables.  The  first  is  a  dummy  variable  indicating 
whether  a  child  between  two  and  nine  years  old  has  a  younger  brother  from  the  same  mother.  The  second 
variable of interest is maternal labor force participation status for children between one and nine  years old. 
We  are  interested  in  analyzing  how  fertility  and  labor  force  participation  are  affected  by  exposure  during 
pregnancy to the temperature shocks.  

4.  Empirical Strategy 

We regress each outcome 𝑦 on a set of temperature exposure measures. Separate exposure measures for each 
trimester during pregnancy are included simultaneously. We use the following specification: 

 

 

𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡 = 𝛼 +   𝛽𝑞 𝑇𝑗𝑞    

3
𝑞

+ 𝛾𝑍 + 𝜇𝑗 + 𝜁𝑚 + 𝜆𝑡 + 𝜉𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡        (5) 

where 𝑇𝑗𝑞     is the exposure of trimester q of gestation for the individual i, born in the municipality j in 
the month m in of the year t. Z is a vector of control variables including maternal and child characteristics. Z 
also includes precipitation and precipitation squared. In our analysis of parental investments, we also include 
a  vector  of  municipality  specific  time  trends.  The  inclusion  of  these  trends  is  possible  in  the  analysis  of 
parental  investments  because  we  have  children  who  were  born  within  a  period  longer  than  two  years.  The 
terms 𝜇 are municipality fixed effects. The month and year fixed effects are 𝜁, and 𝜆, respectively. The term 
of random error is 𝜉. 

The validity of any estimate of the impact of pre-natal exposure to temperature fluctuations based on 
(5)  relies  crucially  on  the  assumption  that  its  estimate  will  produce  unbiased  estimates  of 𝛽𝑞 .  For  this,  we 
require the following identification assumption: 

                                                           
6 To facilitate the presentation, we use the terms municipality blocks and municipalities interchangeably.   

8 

 

 

𝐶𝑜𝑣 𝑇𝑗𝑞    , 𝜉𝑖𝑗𝑚𝑡  | 𝑍, 𝜇𝑗 , 𝜁𝑚 , 𝜆𝑡  = 0∀𝑞 = 1, 2, 3 

 

In other words, including municipality, year and month fixed effects, the impact of fetal exposure is 
identified from  municipality-specific  deviations in  temperature after controlling for all seasonal factors and 
common  shocks  to  all  municipalities.  This  variation  is  assumed  to  be  random  and  therefore  should  not  be 
correlated with omitted determinants of birth outcomes or parental investments. Furthermore, the inclusion of 
specific  time  trends  in  the  investment  models  control  for  long-term  differences  in  weather  and  socio-
economic  factors  across  municipalities  correlated  with  parental  investment  and  human  capital.  Given  these 
conditions, we are able to identify the causal impact of early temperature shocks.  

 
Despite  random  variation  in  temperature  argued  above,  there  are  challenges  to  our  identification 
strategy.  First,  poor  conditions  in  utero  due  to  heat  waves  may  increase  the  rate  of  fetal  death,  as 
hypothesized  by  Lam  and  Miron  (1996).  Empirically  this  is  problematic  because  we  only  observe  birth 
outcomes for those born alive. If those weaker fetuses are the most likely to die, then would arise a selection 
bias.  This  bias  may  also  arise  if  surviving  fetuses  are  those  from  mothers  with  better  economic  status.  A 
second potential problem is that changes in temperature may affect the probability of conception. If the least 
fertile or healthy mothers are less likely to conceive during heat wave episodes, then exposure to temperature 
would be correlated with unobserved factors. A third potential source of bias is that parents can respond to 
temperature shocks migrating. As a result, we would assign incorrectly fetal exposure to temperature changes 
for these infants. In the presence of these sources of bias, our estimates may underestimate the true effect of 
temperature shocks on birth outcomes. 

We do not have a perfect remedy for these potential threats, but we can investigate its relevance. In 
particular,  we  investigate  as  total  births  responds  to  changes  in  temperature.  Insignificant  estimates  would 
suggest that fetal selection bias caused by fetal death is not present. We also investigate other sources of bias 
by running placebo regressions. Favorable results in these tests do not allow us to rule out the possibility that 
our estimates are plagued by these sources of bias. Thus, we conservatively interpret our estimates as lower 
bounds of the true effect of pre-natal exposure to temperature shocks. All specifications use robust standard 
errors clustered at municipality level.  

5.  Results 

5.1.Results from Natality Data 

Table 4 presents the results for Apgar score, low Apgar score, and low birth-weight. Each column is from a 
separate regression. These results include controls related child and mother characteristics mentioned above. 
At the bottom of the table, we present a measure of goodness of fit and the total number of observations. 

Column (1) indicates that exposure during the first trimester to an increase of one standard deviation 
in temperature reduces the Apgar score at around 0.008 points. This result is significant at the 1% level. In 
magnitude,  the  estimated  effect  is  small  relative  to  the  mean  of  the  Apgar  score  (0.08%≈100*0.008/9.6). 
Exposure during the other trimesters has no statistically significant effects. 

The results in column (2) indicate that an increase of one standard deviation in temperature in the first 
trimester implies a statistically significant increase of 0.10 percentage points in the likelihood of low Apgar 
score.  This  impact  is  large  in  magnitude  (10%≈100*0.00102/0.001),  indicating  the  presence  of 
disproportionate effects across Apgar score distribution. Again, there are no significant effects for the second 
and third trimester. 

 

9 

 

Column  (3)  shows  no  detectable  effects  on  the  risk  of  low  birth  weight  in  the  third  and  second 
trimester. However, increases in temperature during the first trimester significantly increase the likelihood of 
low birth weight. In magnitude, one additional standard deviation in temperature implies in an increase of 2% 
in the risk of low birth weight.  

 

5.2.Results from DHS and Census Data 

Table  5  shows  the  results  for  child  health  care.  Columns  (1)-(4)  presents  the  results  for  vaccines,  while 
column (5) for breastfeeding duration. The goodness of fit and number of observations are presented at the 
bottom of table. Robust standard errors are clustered at municipality level.   

We found a statistically significant reduction of exposure in the second trimester in the probability of 
hepatitis  B  vaccine  (Column  (1)).  The  point  estimate  is  -0.019  with  a  standard  error  of  0.0067.  Given  the 
mean  rate  of  75%,  this  implies  that  one  standard  deviation  above  mean  in  temperature  lead  to  a  2.5% 
reduction in the likelihood of hepatitis B vaccine. The columns (3) and (4) show that exposure during the first 
trimester  is  associated  with  a  reduction  in  the  probability  of  polio  and  measles  vaccines.  Specifically,  an 
increase of one standard deviation implies a reduction of 0.8 and 1.04 percentage points in the probability of 
these vaccines, respectively. Relative to mean rates, these coefficients imply a reduction of 0.85 and 1.1%.  

Table  6  presents  the  results  for  parental  investment  in  stimulating  activities  and  schooling.  Column 
(1) shows the results for playing activities and significant exposure effects are observed in the first and third 
trimester.  Children  who  were  exposed  to  one  standard  deviation  higher  in  temperature  during  the  first 
trimester have a reduction of 1.3 percentage points in the likelihood of playing activities. The corresponding 
reduction for the third trimester is 0.8 percentage points. These effects are significant at the 1 and 10% level, 
respectively.  The  results  in  column  (2)  show  that  only  exposure  in  the  third  trimester  affects  walking 
activities.  The  reduction  in  the  likelihood  of  walking  activities  of  exposure  to  increases  of  one  standard 
deviation in temperature in the last trimester is 1.7 percentage points. This effect represents about 2% of the 
mean rate. For reading activities, the effects of the first and third trimester are negative but not statistically 
significant. There are no effects for singing activities.  

Column (5) presents the results for likelihood of preschool attendance. As can be seen, fetal exposure 
to temperature conditions has significant negative effects in all the trimesters. The estimated parameters are 
precisely estimated. In magnitude, exposure in the third trimester has the greatest effect. The reduction in the 
probability  of  attending  pre-school  for  infants  who  were  exposed  in  the  third  trimester  to  one  standard 
deviation  higher  in  temperature  is  4.8  percentage  points.  Given  the  mean  rate  of  61%,  this  implies  that 
exposure  reduces  the  likelihood  of  attending  pre-school  at  7.8%.  The  same  exposure  during  the  first  and 
second trimester leads to reductions of 1.8 and 1.4%, respectively.  

The  most  striking  finding  is  the  increased  probability  of  never  school  attendance  when  a  child  is 
exposed  during  the  first  trimester.  The  point  estimate  is  0.0368  with  a  p-value  of  0.001.  This  coefficient 
implies that a child exposed to one standard deviation higher in temperature increases the likelihood of never 
school attendance by 27%. We also find that those with similar exposure in the second trimester have to 10% 
of increase (significant at 5%).  

5.3.Investigating Reasons for Differential Investments 

We  now  present  evidence  of  reasons  why  early  temperature  shocks  affect  parental  investment.  We  started 
investigating  whether  there  are  persistent  economic  shocks  influencing  our  results.  Persistent  reductions  in 
economic  activity  would  have  two  potential  effects  on  parental  investments.  On  the  one  hand,  lower  labor 

10 

 

 

 
participation may imply falls in family income. This would negatively affect the financial ability of parents to 
invest. In this way, pre-school attendance could be adversely affected. On the other hand, lower labor force 
participation  could  increase  parental  investment  in  time-intensive  inputs.  Miller  and  Urdinola  (2010)  show 
that  when  the  cost  of  time  is  low,  mothers  tend  to  invest  more  in  child  health  care.  Therefore,  persistent 
declines in the opportunity cost of time could positively affect vaccines and stimulation activities. However, 
our results suggest that there are other most important mechanisms since investment in these inputs tend to be 
lower for children who were prenatally exposed to higher temperatures. 

 
To empirically investigate these possibilities, we run all the above specifications but now included as 
a  control  variable  shocks  in  the  GDP  in  the  year  immediately  after  birth7.  The  results  of  this  exercise  are 
presented in Table 7. Each line in the table represents a separate regression. Columns (1) to (3) represent the 
effects of exposure from first to third trimester. Column (4) has the coefficient of early GDP shocks. There is 
virtually  no  change  in  the  coefficients  with  pre-natal  exposure  to  temperature  changes.  In  fact,  the 
coefficients  increase  slightly  in  many  cases.  Early  GDP  shocks,  in  turn,  do  not  appear  to  be  statistically 
significant  in  most  of  the  time.  This  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  temperature  shocks  do  not  affect 
economic activity. Rather, it means that the effects of temperature on economic activity are not persistent. In 
any case, controlling for GDP shocks does not change our results. This suggests that changes in value of time 
are not the main link between temperature shocks and parental investment. 

 
We  now  explore  how  the  labor  force  participation  of  mothers  responds  to  early  temperature 
conditions. The maternal labor force participation could be affected not only by changes in value of time, but 
also  by  the  initial  endowments  of  their  children.  A  mother  could  reduce  their  labor  supply  to  take  care  of 
unhealthy children. Conversely, unhealthy children could increase financing requirements, which would lead 
to  an increase in  labor force participation. Panel  A of Table  8 presents  regressions in  which the  dependent 
variable is a binary variable equal to one if the mother participates in the labor market. The results indicate 
that there are no significant effects. Thus, this suggests that changes in labor force participation are unlikely 
to play an important role.   

 
It  has  been  well  documented  that  children  growing  up  in  larger  families  receive  less  investment  in 
human  capital  due  to  decreased  per  capita  income  (BECKER;  LEWIS,  1973).  The  theoretical  model  of 
Becker and Tomes (1976) suggests that families can change their fertility decisions in response to variations 
in endowments. The predictions of this model are ambiguous. On the one hand, less healthy children increase 
the cost of child quantity. That is, if prenatal exposure to high temperature reduces life expectancy, then, it 
would increase the number of births that a family requires to achieve a given number of surviving children. 
Then, early temperature shocks would increase the shadow price of child quantity, which lead to a reduction 
in  fertility. On the other  hand, unhealthy children mean lower returns of  parental investment,  which would 
increase the shadow price of child quality. Under the quantity-quality tradeoff in this model, this would lead 
to  an  increase  in  fertility.  In  addition,  the  lower  life  expectancy  of  unhealthy  children  may  increase 
replacement fertility, given constant prices of child quantity and quality (DOEPKE, 2005).  

 
In Panel B of Table 8 we investigated if early temperature conditions affect fertility. For this, we use 
the subsample of children between two and nine years old and estimate a model where the dependent variable 
is a dummy indicating if a child has at least one sibling from the same mother. The intuition is that a child 
who does not have a younger brother implies that the mother does not increase fertility. The results suggest 
that exposure in the third trimester reduced the likelihood of having an additional child. The point estimate is 

                                                           
7 Given that in Colombia there are no official estimates for GDP at the municipal level, we use as a proxy for GDP municipal 
revenues. 

11 

 

 

 
-0.011, being significant at the 1% level. Relative to the mean, this implies a marginal effect of -2.5%. These 
results  suggest  that  pre-natal  exposure  to  temperature  shocks  leads  to  reductions  in  fertility.  Thus,  this 
indicates that children exposed pre-natally to high temperature are benefited by the reduction in family size. 
However, this also suggests that there is another mechanism annihilating the benefit of reduced fertility.  
 

6.  Robustness of Findings 

 
We perform a number of robustness tests designed to assess the validity of our identification strategy8. First, 
we  evaluate  whether  the  estimates  of  the  effect  of  early  temperature  conditions  on  birth  outcomes  are 
affected when premature infants are included in the sample. We had excluded this group because infants born 
prematurely are more likely to  have adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, using the sample of infants  with 
normal  length  of  gestation, we can more accurately  assign temperature exposure. All  estimates are broadly 
similar to those of the baseline, but the effect on the risk of low birth weight is estimated less precisely. The 
second  exercise  investigates  the  role  of  the  fetal  selection  bias.  As  we  mentioned  before,  whether  the  heat 
waves  lead  to  more  miscarriages  in  weak  fetuses,  then  our  estimates  may  underestimate  the  true  effect  of 
early  temperature  conditions.  As  a  practical  matter,  we  estimate  the  relationship  between  temperature 
conditions and the births. If such bias is present, then, we should observe a negative relationship between the 
births  and  temperature  conditions.  We  found  no  significant  effect  on  the  number  of  births.  We  also 
investigate whether sex ratio is affected by temperature conditions.  If there is any fetal death bias, then we 
should  expect  that  temperature  shocks  lower  the  sex  ratio  in  favor  of  the  girls,  as  predicted  by  literature 
suggesting  that  poor  conditions  in  utero  have  worse  consequences  for  the  male  fetuses  (ALMOND; 
MAZUMDER,  2011;  ERIKSSON  et  al.,  2010;  KRAEMER,  2000).  We  found  no  significant  effects  on  the 
sex ratio. Finally, we investigated whether there are changes in the composition of births due to, for example, 
selective  timing  of  conception  or  migration.  For  this,  we  estimate  the  relationship  between  temperature 
conditions  and  maternal  characteristics.  To  the  extent  that  our  estimates  do  not  reflect  the  compositional 
changes  in  births  due  to  strategic  maternal  behavior,  prenatal  exposure  to  temperature  shocks  should  not 
predict  maternal  characteristic  changes.  We  found  no  significant  effects,  suggesting  no  changes  in  the 
composition of births.  
 

7.  Conclusion 

 

Analyzing the relationship between early temperature conditions, endowments, and parental investments has 
been the main subject of this study. We found that in utero exposure to heat waves has adverse consequences 
on the initial  endowments.  The most important  timing is  the  first  trimester, since we found  greater effects. 
We  also  show  that  early  exposure  to  heat  waves  decreases  parental  investment  in  child  health  care  and 
schooling.  We  believe  that  variations  in  endowments  due  to  fluctuations  in  temperature  could  have 
negatively  affected  returns  to  the  quality  of  children.  As  a  result,  parents  responded  by  adopting 
reinforcement strategies. However, other mechanisms may play some role. For example, we found that early 
temperature  conditions  affect  fertility  decisions,  suggesting  the  possibility  that  variations  in  endowments 
involve  externalities  in  the  parents'  ability  to  invest  in  human  capital.  Furthermore,  although  our  evidence 
does not suggest that there are persistent changes in income explaining our results, we cannot completely rule 
out this possibility. 
 

Our findings provide evidence suggesting that parents respond to changes in initial endowments. This 
has implications for studies evaluating the fetal programming hypothesis, which states that chronic diseases

in the final stages of life stem from the uterus. For example, an influential work by Almond (2006) found that 
individual  exposed  prenatally  to  pandemic  influenza  were  more  likely  to  report  physical  illnesses,  besides 
lower  educational  attainment  and  wages.  However,  in  the  presence  of  parental  response  to  variations  in 
endowments,  as  our  results  suggest,  parents  could  enlarge  the  initial  disadvantages  by  investing  less  in 
human  capital.  Therefore,  part  of  the  effects  found  in  Almond  (2006)  may  reflect  the  lower  parental 
investment  in  health  care  during  childhood.  As  a  result,  these  studies  may  overestimate  the  role  of  fetal 
programming. 

 

At  this  point,  we  should  point  out  that  there  are  various  caveats.  First,  our  estimates  represent  the 
effect of the reduced form of prenatal exposure to temperature shocks. Given the multidimensional concept 
of capabilities, our estimates do not allow us to disentangle what type of initial endowment has more or less 
influence on parental investment. This could be important in view that parental response to a cognitive shock 
could be different from a health shock, as hypothesized by Yi et al (2014). Our methodology provides only 
suggestive evidence of the combined effect of these channels. Second, it is not clear the external validity of 
our  results  for  countries  with  different  climatic  characteristics.  For  example,  the  effects  of  temperature 
increases on the initial endowments may be different for countries with very low temperatures. In fact, there 
is evidence based on correlations suggesting that increases in temperature are beneficial to the fetus in these 
countries.  Thus,  setting  aside  the  issue  of  generalizability,  the  fact  that  weather  shocks  will  become 
increasingly  common  implies  that  understanding  the  short  and  long  term  consequences  of  temperature 
variations is an important question per se. Therefore, our study is at least a clarion call for future research in 
this area.
