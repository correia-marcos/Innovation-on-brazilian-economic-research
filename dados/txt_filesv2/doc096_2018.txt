Abstract 

China’s accession to the WTO has shifted international trade and the literature on its impact in 
other countries’ exports is still scant. This paper aims to contribute to this literature by investigating the 
impact  of  Chinese  expansion  in  the  international  trade  in  the  exports  of  three  Latin  American  (LA) 
countries:  Brazil,  Mexico  and  Peru.  Considering  developed  and  developing  countries  as  destinations 
from  these  LA  countries,  results  suggest  that  these  three  countries  were  affected  by  the  insertion  of 
China in the international trade. Overall, firms of these three countries lost 5.7% of their exports to the 
US and 7.2% to the  EU  due  to  China expansion. In terms of volume,  these  three  countries  lost  USD 9 
billion  dollars  of  exports  just  in  the  US  market.  Comparing  the  outcomes  between  countries,  Brazil 
seems to be the most affected compared to Mexico and Peru in relative terms. Looking at the margins 
and  types  of  goods,  final  goods  suffered  more  from  the  Chinese  competition  compared  to 
intermediaries,  yet  it  is  not  feasible  to  distinguish  which  margin,  intensive  or  extensive,  was  mostly 
affected. 
 

 

Resumo 

A  entrada  da  China  à  OMC  mudou  o  comércio  mundial  e  a  literatura  sobre  seus  impactos 
permanece escassa. Esse artigo visa contribuir para essa literatura ao investigar o impacto da expansão 
chinesa  no  comércio  internacional  nas  exportações  de  três  países  da  América  Latina:  Brasil,  México  e 
Peru. Considerando países desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento como destinos das exportações desses 
três  países, os  resultados sugerem  que  os mesmos  foram  impactados  negativamente  pela  entrada  da 
China no comércio mundial. De  uma forma geral, as firmas desses três países perderam 5,7%  de  suas 
exportações para os EUA e 7,2% para a União Europeia por conta da expansão da China. Em termos de 
volume,  esses  três  países  deixaram  de  exportar  US$  9  bilhões  somente  para  o  mercado  americano. 
Comparando os resultados entre os países, o Brasil apresenta ser o mais afetado comparado a México e 
Perú em termos relativos. Olhando as margens e os tipos de produtos, os produtos finais sofreram mais 
com a competição chinesa em comparação aos produtos intermediários, porém não é factível distinguir 
qual margem, intensiva ou extensiva, foi a mais afetada.

Introduction 
Trade  policies  (such  as  trade  liberalization,  trade  agreements  and  so  forth)  have  dominated  to 
international trade literature as the main economic shock to affect trade. However, this emphasis began 
to  be  questioned  by  some  scholars.  For  instance,  Goldberg  and  Pavcnik  (2016)  argues  that  other 
economic  shocks,  such  as  Chinese  productivity  growth  and  its  entrance  to  the  WTO  in  2001,  became 
more  relevant  to  affect  international  trade  than  trade  policies  per  se.  Different  scholars  have  already 
started to investigate the impacts of China in developed and developing countries [see Acemoglu et al 
(2016), Autor et al (2013) and Pierce and Schott (2016) for the USA, Mion and Zhu (2013) for Belgium, 
Utar and Ruiz (2013) and Blyde et al (2017) for Mexico, Costa et al (2016), Moreira and Lage de Sousa 
(2017)  and  Paz  (2017)  for  Brazil].  Majority  of  these  papers  focuses  on  labor  market  adjustments  and 
some  on  firm’s  efficiency.1  Although  Chinese  import  penetration  has  displaced  some  domestic 
producers, it has also substitute imports from other countries in a diverse range of markets. While the 
effects on the former are widely explored, the impacts on the latter are still scant. Closer to the spirit of 
this paper is Bas and Bombarda (2012), since it investigates the liberalization occurred in Asian countries 
on the French exports. This paper tries to fill out the gap in the literature on how exports from other 
developing countries have been affected by the entrance of China in the WTO using export micro data 
from three developing countries: Brazil, Mexico and Peru. 
This paper contributes to that literature on the effects of trade on the extensive margin. A part of the 
literature investigates the impact of trade in general on the extensive margin, such as Feenstra (1994) 
and Broda and Weinstein (2006) and their results suggest a substantial impact of trade on the extensive 
margin. Another part assess the impact of trade policies on the extensive margin either new variety or 
new destination [Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997), Arkolakis et al (2008) and Goldberg et al (2010)], 
while another on the extensive margin of entry [see Caliendo et al (2015) as an example]. Klenow and 
Rodriguez-Clare (1997) and Arkolakis et al (2008) found limited impact of trade policy on the extensive 
margins in Costa Rica, yet these results are not corroborated in Goldberg et al (2010) in India since their 
results suggest an impact in new products. Moreover, Caliendo et al (2015) evidences infer that trade 
policy  has  a  large  impact  on  firm  entry  and  the  effect  is  more  pronounced  in  developed  than  in 
developing  countries.  Therefore,  much  more  work  in  this  area  should  be  pursued  in  order  to  have  a 
general assessment of the effects of trade on the extensive margins, as pointed by Goldberg and Pavcnik 
(2016). 
Given this background, this paper adds in the literature in two fronts. First, it assesses the impact of an 
economic shock, China shock, more relevant to international trade than a trade policy per se. Moreover, 
it  was  a  shock  at  international  scale  which  has  affected  a  diverse  range  of  countries  not  only  inward 
their economies but also outward. Second, it contributes to the recent investigation on the margins of 
trade, which has received increasingly attention by the literature. 
In order to investigate this issue, this paper uses export firm-level data from three Latin American (LA) 
countries  representing  three  different  economic  trade  blocks:  Brazil  (Mercosur);  Peru  (Andean 
Community); Mexico (NAFTA).2 Using a detailed firm-level data, this investigation evaluates how much 
firms  from  these  countries  have  reduced their  exports  to  relevant  markets,  such  as  the  United  States 
and  European  Union,  and  to  other  developing  countries,  which  is  represented  by  the  bilateral  trade 
between them. Additionally, differences between intensive and extensive margins are explored as well 
as  products  classification  between  final  and  intermediate  goods.  Results  suggest  that  firms  in  these 
countries were negatively affected by the expansion of Chinese goods in any kind of markets. Moreover, 

                                                           
1 Only Blyde et al (2017) and Moreira and Lage de Sousa (2017) investigate the effect on other firms’ performance, 
for example productivity. All other papers listed investigate only labor outcomes.

Jenkins et al (2008), Machado e Ferraz (2006) and Pereira (2014).

final goods suffered more from the Chinese competition compared to intermediaries, yet it is not clear 
which  margin,  intensive  or  extensive,  was  mostly  affected  by  the  China  shock.  Although  it  is  not 
distinguishable  between  intensive  and  extensive  margins,  outcomes  are  robust  to  find  an  impact  of a 
trade shock in the margins, which is contribution to the literature which was controversial as described 
in Goldberg and Pavcnik (2016). 
In order to explore this issue, this paper is structure as follows apart from this introduction. Section 1 
provides an economic background of these countries export performance after the emergence of China 
in the international trade market. Methodology is described in Section 2 followed by data description in 
the  next  section.  Section  4  provides  the  results  in  different  markets.  Different  angles  of  exports  are 
explored in Section 5, such as intensive versus extensive margins as well as distinct types of goods. Last 
section provides the concluding remarks. 
Economic Background 
The  three  countries  investigated  in  this  paper  have  close  ties  to  the  United  States  (US)  and  European 
Union  (EU).  For  instance,  nearly  90%  of  Mexican  and  a  quarter  of  the  Brazilian  and  Peruvian  exports 
were destined to the US market in 2000. After 13 years, their export shares to the US have reduced to 
78.8% for Mexico, 10.2% for Brazil and 18.3% for Peru. One part is explained by the increase importance 
of China in the export basket from these LA countries, but another is their loss of market share in the US 
market.  In order  to  have  an  idea  on  how  much  these  countries  have  lost  market  share  in the US  and 
European market, Graph 1 presents the share of these three countries in both markets from 90’s until 
2013.3 As shown, similarities between these two destinations exist, but also there are distinct patterns. 
One different fact is that China already had a larger share of the EU imports compared to these three 
countries in the 90’s, but the opposite occurs in the US market. Another distinction between these the 
US and EU markets is that the shares of Chinese exports and the share of these three LA countries were 
stable in the EU market in the 90’s, yet an upward trend in the US market is perceived for both (China 
and LA countries) during the same period. The path changes completely after 2000 for China and these 
three LA countries. On one hand, China remains acquiring market share in the US, reaching 20% of total 
US imports. On the other hand, these LA countries stalled completely around 12.5% in the twenty first 
century.  In  the  EU  market,  China  shares  jumped  to  over  10%  while  imports  from  these  three  LA 
countries remained less than 2%. 

INSERT GRAPH 1 HERE 

Overall,  China  gained  substantial  market  share  in  the  US  and  EU  markets  since  their  ascension  in  the 
WTO  (10.6  p.p.  and  6.7  p.p.,  respectively),  while  these  three  LA  countries  stagnated.  The  increased 
participation  of  Chinese  goods  in  these  markets  enhanced  the  competition  for  exporters  from  those 
three LA countries. 
Chinese  export  success  is not  restricted  to the main  markets,  US  and  EU; thus  it  is  also  interesting  to 
consider the impact of China in the exports from these three LA countries to other developing countries. 
As Brazil, Mexico and Peru are considered similar in terms of their export performance, according to the 
World  Bank,  considering  each  of  them  as  a  destination  from  another  one  seems  reasonable.  In  other 
words, how much was lost from Brazilian exporters due to the imports of Chinese products in Mexico 
and Peru is considered in this investigation. This might  be  important for Brazil and to a less extent  to 
Mexico  and  Peru,  since  Brazil  manufacturing  exports  to  Latin  America  is  a  relevant  share  of  its  total 
exports.  
Methodology 
Our  empirical  strategy  begins  by  pooling  all  export  information  from  three  origin  countries  (Brazil, 
Mexico  and  Peru)  to  five  destinations:  USA,  European  Union  and  the  other  two  Latin  American 
                                                           
3 The share of these LA countries is the total US or EU imports from these three countries divided by the total 
imports from the US and EU.

countries. For instance, Mexico and Peru are the destinations considered in the Brazilian exports, and so 
forth. For econometric specification, this paper follows the commonly empirical trade literature which 
works with firm-level data, sometimes named “shift-share” analysis. While the dependent variable is at 
firm level, the main important independent variable is aggregated at product level, which provides an 
exogenous measure for the referred investigation. In summary, basic econometric specification utilized 
in this paper is described by equation 1.  
Log(Yiodp,t+1)= c + γ log(ChinaSharedp,t)+ α V’iodp,t + µiodp + θt + εiodp,t  
         (1) 
Yiodp,t+1  is  the  export  value  of  firm  i  from  country  o  to  destination  d  of  product  p  in  time  t+1, 
ChinaSharedp,t  is  the  Chinese  export  share  in  destination  d  of  product  p  in  time  t,  V’iodp,t  is  a  vector of 
controls, µiodp is the firm-origin-destination-product fixed effect, θt is the year fixed effect and εiodp,t is the 
error  term.  In  other  words,  the  estimations  consider  fixed  effects  in  terms  of  firm,  product,  origin, 
destination  and  year.  Therefore,  all  time-invariant  characteristics  which  could  explain  any  of  these 
dimension, such as country’s geographical location, natural comparative advantage to produce a certain 
product, bilateral trade advantage, or even firm’s location close to good infrastructure, are captured by 
these fixed effects. 
Moreover,  the  specification  has  one-year  lag  between  the  independent  and  dependent  variable  to 
provide a more exogenous independent variable, which is commonly used in the literature, see Bas and 
Bombarda  (2012)  as  an  example.  As  the  main  variables  are  in  logs,  the  coefficient  gamma  (γ)  is  the 
elasticity between the import share of Chinese goods and firm’s export of the referred product. 
For  controls,  aside  the  fixed  effects,  a  combination  of  time-variant  characteristics  is  also  considered. 
First, total exports of the firm to the world is utilized to capture any size variation at firm level. Since the 
independent variable is lagged one-year, then the total amount exported in the previous year is utilized 
as  a  measure  of  firms’  size.  As  there  are  other  factors  at  firm  level  that  varies  over  time,  such  as 
efficiency measured by productivity, firm-year fixed effect is included to capture the entire time-varying 
characteristic at firm level that affects firms’ capability to export. 
Other  two  extra  controls  are  considered  at  product  level.  First,  goods  exported  from  these  countries 
face  different  import  tariffs  in  distinct  destinations.  Therefore,  effective  import  tariffs  faced  by  each 
product  at HS 4 level in each destination is included to absorb that, as used in Li and Moreira (2018). 
Products from these countries might have a different performance over the years, for example a policy 
aiming to improve the productivity of specifics products, thus share of each product for each country in 
the  world  market  is  calculated  to  capture  any  kind  of  improve  of  comparative  advantage  obtained 
during the period or even any kind of change bilateral trade agreement. 
After having the full picture of the exports of all three investigated countries in four markets, being two 
developed markets and  other  two  developing  countries,  it  is  interesting  to  break  down  the  sample  in 
order  to  investigate  the  effects  in  each  market.  First,  effects  in  the  EU  and  US  markets  should  be 
investigated. Therefore, all the firm-level database from Brazil, Mexico and Peru are pooled to see if the 
Chinese share in the American and European market have reduced level of exports of these three Latin 
American countries as a whole. In order to estimate this, one fixed effect should be discarded as only 
one  destination  for  all  countries  is  considered,  therefore  fixed  effect  shifts  from  firm-product-origin-
destination to firm-product-origin only. However, firms in each country face different market access, for 
instance, Mexican firms have NAFTA yet Brazilian and Peruvian not, yet when estimating by country, it is 
relevant to remove another fixed effect (origin), therefore fixed effect remains solely as firm-product. 
Aside time-invariant characteristics, this paper estimate the model combining some characteristics with 
year to control for any characteristic-year fixed effects to capture any kind of time variant characteristics 
which  might  interfere  the export  performance  of a  product  from  a  firm originated  from one  of  those 
three countries to the investigated destinations, such as any change in the trade policy that might have 
benefited specific firms to export a particular good originated from one LA country to one of the four 
destinations considered. As described in the time-invariant fixed effects, each data used will require a 

4 

different  characteristic-year fixed effect,  ranging from firm-product-origin-destination-year fixed effect 
to only firm-product-year fixed effect depending on which data is considered. 
Although  the  main  variable  is  lagged  in  time  and  aggregated  at  product  level,  it  remains  endogenous 
since an exogenous demand shock might be correlated to the participation of China in the total import 
from  each  country.  Following  Autor,  Dorn  and  Hanson  (2013)  methodology,  the  share  of  China  in  a 
similar region lagged another three years is used as instrument. For example, if when investigating the 
effects of China imports in the US market on the Brazilian exports, the share of Chinese imports in the 
European Union market is used as an instrument lagged in time, and vice-versa. For exports to other LA 
countries, information between them is triangulated. Since these countries are similar in terms of export 
performance, using the remaining country as instrument seems reasonable. For instance, the share of 
Chinese imports in Peru as the instrument lagged in time is used when estimating the impact of Chinese 
goods in the exports of Brazilian firms to Mexico, and so forth. 
Data 
To  implement  this  investigation,  export  firm-level  dataset  from  the  three  countries  mentioned 
previously  is  utilized:  Brazil,  Mexico  and  Peru.  Peruvian  and  Mexican  datasets  are  from  the  Export 
Dynamic  Database  created  by  the  World  Bank,  see  Fernandes,  Freund  and  Pierola  (2016)  for  further 
information. While the Brazilian export data was provided by the Brazilian Trade Secretary (Secretaria de 
Comercio Exterior – SECEX). All these data are disaggregated as firm-year-product-destination.  
Different HS classification occurred in the investigated period. Cebeci (2015) is used as a guide to create 
a  homogenous  product  classification  over  the  years.  The  period  available  differs  from  each  country, 
while Peruvian data is from 1993 until 2007, the Mexican ranges from 2000 until 2007 and the Brazilian, 
from  1997  until  2010.  Therefore,  the  common  period  for  this  investigation  is  from  2000  until  2007, 
which is the base period for this paper.4 
Our independent variable is constructed by using the UNCOMTRADE product-year level dataset from the 
following  economic  regions:  European  Union,  United  States,  Brazil,  Mexico  and  Peru.  Chinese  import 
shares  in  the  European  Union  and  United  States  are  used  for  the  three  countries  investigated.  The 
information on the  Chinese  import share in each of the investigated country is used in triangular way 
between them, as explained in the empirical strategy. 
Controls measured at product level have two different sources. Tariffs are extracted mainly from WITS, 
but some more detailed information are obtained from the Latin-American Integration Association (its 
acronym  ALADI  in  Spanish)  or  Central  American  Common  Market  (CACM).  The  value  of  the  tariff 
represents  the  preferential  tariff  which  each  product  of  these  countries  face  in  each  market.  For  the 
share of each product from each particular country, trade information from the UNCOMTRADE dataset 
is utilized. 
Results 
First results are presented in Table 1 and they are based on estimating equation 1 using the firm-level 
data from the three  countries pooled together to all destinations considered in this investigation. The 
first three columns present the outcomes using only fixed-effects approach, while the last three columns 
show the results using IV approach, where the share of Chinese goods in the other market lagged three 
years is utilized as instrument. The first columns of each method (columns 1 and 4) present results using 
only the time-invariant FE at firm, product, origin and destination level as well as year FE. The second 
columns  (2  and  5)  incorporate  the  firm-year  FE.  The  last  columns  (3  and  6)  is  the  most  complete 
specification since it considers firm-origin-destination-year FE.  
Considering  controls  used,  they  all  present  the  expected  outcomes,  which  is  larger  firms  and  those 
exporting products with higher comparative advantage (measured by the product share in total exports

this paper and available upon request.

averaged at firm-level) tend to export more, while those facing larger barriers by import tariffs appears 
to  export  less.  Focusing  on  the  main  investigated  variable,  results  back  up  the  idea  that  Chinese 
penetration in the international trade has reduced the exports of LA firms, since it is negative despite 
which  approach  is  considered.  Although  negative,  some  results  seem  to  be  elastic  while  others  not 
much. Using the IV estimation with all the controls available, for every 1% increase of Chinese exports to 
US, a firm in these countries diminishes its export of that good by 0.9%. It is important to mention that  
instrument used shows reasonable first-stage evidence. 

INSERT TABLE 1 HERE 

Estimating the effects in the US market is important because it was the market which Chinese goods had 
an incredible growth reaching nearly 1 in every 5 dollars imported from Americans. Then, focus on this 
market to evaluate what was the impact of Chinese imports is relevant. Table 2 shows the results in the 
USA market following the same structure from Table 1. 

INSERT TABLE 2 HERE 

Results on the US market remain similar to those presented in Table 1. For controls, the only difference 
occurs in the tariffs which become non-significant in most cases, including the most complete one. The 
main reason might be that existent trade agreements have removed the explanation power of tariffs in 
firms’ export performance, especially considering that most of the observations are from Mexico which 
signed NAFTA in the  90s. Looking at  the main investigated variable, China Share, it is easy to observe 
that  the  Chinese  expansion  has  reduced  the  level  of  exports  from  each  firm;  however,  at  a  lower 
magnitude.  In  the  most  complete  model,  the  elasticity  is  0.75  which  means  that  any  1%  increase  in 
imports from China would reduce the export from Latin American firms by 0.75%. 
Another  important  market  for  Latin  American  countries  is  the  European  Union.  Table  3  presents  the 
results considering only this destination as a market for LA goods. Results become even more similar to 
Table  1,  since  the  parameter  for  tariffs  shift  back  to  negative  consistently.  The  China  Share  persists 
negative  across  specifications  as  in  previous  results.  However,  the  magnitude  is  larger  in  all 
specifications, which means that the elasticity regarding the European market is higher. Considering the 
most reliable estimate, column 6, an increase of 1% of Chinese exports to the European Union reduces 
the exports by 1.6% from firms of these three LA countries. In other words, the effects on the European 
market  is  twice  more  intense  than  in  the  US  market.  This  might  indicate  that  the  commercial  ties 
between US and these Latin American countries are stronger than those with European Union. 

INSERT TABLE 3 HERE 

Analysis shifts to how Chinese import penetration in the US and EU markets has impacted each of these 
three countries individually. Although these three countries are similar in terms of export performance, 
they still have their own particularity, especially in terms of their export destination. Table 4 shows the 
estimation of equation 1 for each of these three countries and the US as a destination of their exports. 
The  first  6  columns  show  the  estimation  without  instruments  and  the  last  6  columns,  using  an  IV 
approach. Each country has two columns. Those with odd numbers does not contemplate the firm-year 
FE, but it includes size as a control. Columns with even numbers includes the firm-year FE, which drops 
the size as control.  

INSERT TABLE 4 HERE 

Results remain consistent with all the countries pooled together, which means: Chinese penetration in 
the US market  has reduced the exports of firms in these three  LA countries.  Using or not  instrument, 
firms in Brazil, Peru and Mexico have their exports reduced to the US due to the increase competition of 
China goods. However, countries differ in term of the effects. Looking at the IV results using firm-year 
FE, Brazil and Peru show elasticity equal to one, while Mexico show a lower magnitude. For every 1% 
increase of Chinese imports in the US market reduced the export volume of a Brazilian or Peruvian firms 
by  around  1%,  but  only  0.65%  from  a  Mexican  firm.  These  results  may  suggest  that  countries  with  a 
trade agreement tend to suffer much less than others. For instance, Mexico has a trade agreement with 

6 

the US since 1994 and the effect of Chinese goods on Mexican exports was inelastic and around a third 
lower of what Brazilian and Peruvian firms suffered.  
As described previously, it is relevant to investigate the effects in the EU market. Table 5 presents the 
outcomes on how these three LA countries were affected by the import of Chinese goods from the EU 
market following the structure of Table 4. Results remain similar to those from Table 4, since the main 
estimated  parameters,  China  Share,  are  negative  in  most  specifications.  For  comparison  between 
countries, the most reliable result is considered, which contain the IV estimation and controls for firm-
year FE (columns 8, 10 and 12). Looking at these results, it is feasible to conclude that Brazil and Mexico 
were more impacted than Peru, around 10 times. For every 1% growth of Chinese imported goods in the 
EU market, exports from Brazilian and Mexican firms are dropped by 2% yet from Peruvian firms, only 
0.2%.  This evidence confirms that Chinese goods tend to be more substitutes of Brazilian and Mexican 
goods compared to Peruvians, which seems plausible as the economies of Brazil and Mexico are more 
diverse than from Peru. 

INSERT TABLE 5 HERE 

Another interesting comparison is in which market these countries were most affected by the increase 
competition of Chinese goods in the US and EU markets. Peru seems to be less impacted in its exports to 
EU market than to US market, because results are more robust across specifications in the later than in 
the former. Moreover, the elasticity in the US market is five times higher in magnitude than the same 
for  the  EU  market.  In  this  regard,  results  suggest  that  Peruvian  exports  tend  to  be  more  similar  to 
Chinese goods in the US market than in the EU market. 
Brazil and Mexico suffered more from the competition of Chinese goods in the EU market than in the US 
market,  yet  these  two  countries  differ  substantially  in  terms  of  their  intensity  in  each  market.  While 
Mexican firms were affected nearly four times in EU (2.3/0.6) than in the US, Brazilian firms less than 
double  (1.9/0.9).  For  Mexico,  one  possible  explanation  might  be  the  length  of  time  of  Mexican  trade 
agreement with these two destinations. Mexico has signed a NAFTA free trade agreement in 1994 and 
with EU six years later; therefore, trade relationships between Mexico and the USA seem more resistant 
that  those  between  Mexico  and  EU  to  an  exogenous  shock  (the  emergence  of  China).  This  evidence 
suggests that the length of a trade agreement might attenuate the effects of the China shock.  
The impact of Chinese goods is not restricted to the main markets, such as the US and EU, but rather all 
other destinations. In order to evaluate the impact of the Chinese expansion in developing world, the 
impact  on  the  export  of  these  countries  to  each  other  is  estimated,  as  explained  in  the  empirical 
strategy section. Table 6 shows the results using the most complete method, which is the IV approach 
using firm-year FE (last columns from each case in previous tables).  

INSERT TABLE 6 HERE 

Brazil and Mexico are the countries which have a larger export base than Peru to developing countries, 
especially  in  terms  of  manufacturing  goods.  As  a  consequence,  these  two  countries  were  the  most 
affected  by  the  Chinese  import  penetration while  exporting  to other LA  countries.  The  elasticity  from 
these two countries ranges from 1.5 to 2, which means that every 1% increase  in imports from China 
reduces the export of Brazilian and Mexican firms by nearly from 1.5% to 2%. Peruvian exporters were 
the only ones not affected by the competition of Chinese goods in the Brazilian and Mexican markets, 
since the elasticity estimated is non-significant. Overall, it is feasible to infer that Peruvian goods are not 
competitors of Chinese goods in developing countries, while Brazilian and Mexican are. Moreover, these 
results  suggest that  the  loss  derived  by  the  Chinese  competition  for  Brazilian  and  Mexican  exports  to 
developing  countries  are  similar  to  those  observed  in  EU.  Therefore,  firms  from  Brazil  and  Mexico 
compete with similar Chinese products in developing countries as in the European market. Therefore, a 
policy  recommendation  might  be  the  expansion  of  trade  agreements  within  LA  countries  in  order  to 
mitigate the impact of China expansion in these markets.

Further Results 
Outcomes from this paper have shown that Brazilian, Mexican and Peruvian exporters were affected by 
the Chinese penetration in a diverse range of markets, but so far, they are silent in what type of exports 
has  been  mostly  affected,  such  as  by  intensive  versus  extensive  margins  and  by  product  type  (final 
versus intermediary).5 In this section, these possibilities are explored. Initially, intensive versus extensive 
margins is assessed by dividing the sample into these two categories. In sequence, extensive margin is 
split into entry in the investigated market and exporting a new product to this aforementioned market. 
Every export  belonging to the  intensive margin means that a firm has exported the same  good to the 
same destination in a previous year. If they have started to export to the investigated destination or a 
new product to the designated destination, then it is considered an extensive margin.6 Basically, data is 
divided according to the diagram below:

Extensive Margin Product 

Outcomes  for  intensive  and  extensive  margins  are  presented  in  Table  6  for  all  three  LA  countries 
investigated in this paper to all destinations considered: developed region (US and EU) and developing 
countries (Brazil, Mexico and Peru). The table is structured as follows, the first four columns show the 
results in the US market, followed by other four columns on the EU market and the last six columns to 
the LA countries as destinations. The first four lines show the results on intensive margin, followed by 
other four lines on the extensive margin, another four lines for extensive margin entry and the last four 
lines, extensive margin product. All results are based on the most reliable result as shown in Table 6: IV 
approach with firm-year FE for countries individually and firm-origin-year FE when pooling Brazil, Mexico 
and Peru together (columns 1 and 5). Contrary to the existent literature on the effects of trade shocks 
on the margins,  our results suggest robust  evidence that China shock  has impacted negatively on any 
kind of margin. 

INSERT TABLE 7 HERE 

Overall, the Chinese invasion in the US market has impacted negatively exports of intensive margin from 
these  tree  countries  jointly,  but  this  result  is  mostly  driven  by  Brazil  and  Peru,  since  Mexican  exports 
were  not  impacted.  This  is  evidence  that  the  bilateral  trade  developed  after  NAFTA  came  into  force 
might have attenuated the Chinese impact. In the EU market, all countries show a negative sign in the 
intensive  margin,  not  only  jointly  but  also  isolated. Brazil  was  the  most  affected  as  an  increase  of 1% 
from Chinese imports reduced the exports in the intensive margin of Brazilian goods by 2.5%, while the 
Mexican by 1.8% and Peru 0.5%. Comparing these results with the US, Brazil has suffered more in the EU 
market, but  Peru in the US market. When estimating these elasticities  in the intensive margin for the 

                                                           
5 Nearly 90% of the HS products are from the manufacturing sector and estimating for manufacturing goods does 

not differ from the overall results. 

6 As it is investigating only one destination, it is assumed that a new country destination is considered a new entry. 
For instance, consider a firm which was exporting to other countries but not the US, if it starts exporting to the US, 
it  is  considered  a  new  entry  rather  than  a  new  destination.  Moreover,  classification  of  intensive  and  extensive 
margin  is  made  on  a  year  by  year  case.  For  instance,  it  is  considered  the  previous  year  to  establish  if  it  is  an 
intensive or extensive margin, as well as to classify them by entry or product.

exports  to  developing  countries,  Brazil  and  Mexico  were  also  affected  by  the  Chinese  penetration  in 
these markets; Peru does not show any effect. However, the magnitude is similar to what was observed 
to the European market. Comparing which markets, either from developing countries or from developed 
countries,  only  Peruvian  exports  shows  a  distinction,  since  only  their  exports  to  developed  countries 
that were affected by the Chinese expansion in the international trade market. 
The  effect  of  China  expansion  in  international  trade  seems  to  have  distinct  impacts  in  the  extensive 
margin compared to intensive margin depending on which bilateral trade is considered. Considering the 
three LA countries jointly, outcomes suggest that extensive margin was more impacted in their exports 
to the US compared to intensive margin, yet differences in the  European market does not allow us to 
say which margin suffered more. In the US market, Mexico is the only case which it is possible to infer 
that  the  extensive  margin  was  more  affected  than  intensive  margin.  Thus,  although  existent 
relationships  between  Mexico  exporters  and  US  importers  appears  to  not  be  impacted  by  the  China 
Shock, the possibility to enter in the US market, either by a new firm or by exporting a new product, has 
become harder for Mexican exporters due to the increase presence of China in the US market. In terms 
of exports of extensive margin to developing countries, Peru remains not being affected by the Chinese 
invasion  in  the  Brazilian  and  Mexico  markets,  yet  Mexico  and  Brazil  were  negatively  affected  in  their 
bilateral trade.  
Looking  at  the  impacts  of  the  two  types  of  extensive  margin,  Chinese  competition  was  fiercer  in  the 
extensive margin of entry compared to the extensive margin of products in the US market (1.1 versus 
0.7), yet the opposite occurs in the EU market (1.6 versus 0.9). In other words, Chinese imports in the US 
makes it more difficult for LA firms to enter in this market than in the EU market, but the exports of a 
new product  from these three  LA countries  to the EU become more challenging compared to the US. 
This  suggests  that once  firms  from LA  countries  are able  to  establish  a  relationship  with  the  US,  they 
suffer  less  from  other  competitors  compared  to  the  EU  which  entrance  seems  easier,  yet  difficult  to 
export a new good. Regarding the extensive margin for entry and product to developing countries, only 
Brazilian  exports  to  Mexico  show  robust  results  in  the  two  dimensions  (entry  and  product).  Mexican 
exports to either Brazil or Peru were also negatively impacted at the introduction of a new product in 
these markets by the Chinese competition. 
Evidence  on  extensive  and  intensive  margin  are  linked  with  the  idea  that  Mexican  and  Brazilian 
economies tend to export products similar to Chinese  goods compared to Peru. Therefore, larger and 
more diversified economies in developing world tend to suffer more from the competition from Chinese 
goods. Moreover, the elasticities obtained in this paper are generally above one, which means that for 
any increase of Chinese exports, firms from those countries tend to lose much more. 
Another venue which could be explored is evaluating the impact on distinct types of goods, as done in 
Bas and Bombarda (2012). Following this aforementioned paper methodology, products are reclassified 
into  two  categories  from  the  BEC:  final  and  intermediary.  Following  the  format  of  Table  7,  results 
splitting the sample into these three products categories are presented in Table 8. The only difference 
from Table 7 is how  lines are distributed. The first  lines  are now  for final goods, followed by lines  for 
intermediary goods and lastly by lines for capital goods.  

INSERT TABLE 8 HERE 

In  terms  of  final  goods,  Brazil  and  Mexico  seem  to  be  the  most  affected,  since  all  the  elasticities 
estimated are superior to what is encountered in Peru regardless which destination, either developed 
countries  (EU  and  US)  or  developing  countries  (Mexico  or  Peru).  According  to  the  outcomes,  Brazil 
appears to be mostly affected than Mexico, especially in the US and in developing countries. Moreover, 
most  of  all  the  significant  elasticities  are  above  one,  which  means  that  any  increase  of  imports  of 
Chinese final goods will reduce the export of those countries more than proportionally. 
As for intermediaries, the elasticity is lower in the US market compared to EU, which is the opposite of 
what  was  found  for  final  goods.  In  the  US  market,  only  Mexico  seems  to  be  affected  by  Chinese 

9 

imported goods and with an elasticity below one, which means that the effect in the US market was very 
limited. In the EU market, estimated elasticities for Brazil and Mexico are above two, and then exports 
of  these  two  countries  suffered  more  than  proportionately  by  the  import  of  Chinese  goods.  In 
developing market, the effect is very similar to the EU market, as the estimated elasticity was around 2 
for  Brazil  and  Mexico.  Peruvian  intermediary  goods  exported  were  not  affected  by  the  Chinese 
competition in neither market: developed and developing regions. 
Conclusion 
In this paper, the impact of Chinese goods in the exports of three LA countries (Brazil, Mexico and Peru) 
to  developed  and  developing  regions  is  estimated.  These  three  countries  represent  different  trade 
economic zones in LA: MERCOSUR, NAFTA and Andean Community. Results suggest that these countries 
were  highly  affected  by  the  Chinese  competition  in  both  regions.  Overall,  elasticities  estimated  show 
that an increase of Chinese penetration in any market generally imposes a larger loss in these countries 
export, since the elasticities magnitude is over 1 in most cases. Considering the expansion of China was 
7.7%  in  the  US  and  4.5%  in  the  EU  from  2000  until  2007,  the  loss  of  the  exports  due  to  the  Chinese 
expansion in these markets was 5.7% and 7.2%, respectively.7 This evidence contrasts with those using 
aggregate data, which showed a higher impact in the US rather than in the European Union, see Pereira 
(2014). However, results using aggregate data are based on the comparison of absolute value of the loss 
in USD. In this paper, just considering the US as a destination, these three countries lost USD 9 billion 
dollars in exports because of Chinese goods. 
Comparing results of which country was mostly affected, outcomes suggest that countries with a trade 
agreement, such as NAFTA from Mexico and the US, tend to be less impacted by the inclusion of a new 
competitor in relative terms, but these results need to be corroborated with other investigations since 
most of the effect might have taken place before signing the trade agreement.8 Despite this discussion 
on trade agreements, it is evident that Brazil was the most affected by the China shock, since elasticities 
estimated are predominantly higher in the Brazilian case.  
Impact  of  trade  shocks  on  the  margins  is  still  debatable  in  the  current  trade  literature  [Goldberg  and 
Pavcnik (2016)], but outcomes of this paper provide robust evidence on the effect of the China shock on 
the margins of trade. However, it is not clear which margin, intensive or extensive, was mostly affected 
by  the  Chinese  shock,  because  results  differ  substantially  across  countries.  However,  evidence  on 
different types of goods seems more robust as they show a higher impact on final goods compared to 
intermediary  goods.  These  results  on  types  of  goods  are  complementary  to  what  Bas  and  Bombarda 
(2012) found for French exporters. According to their findings, intermediary goods were more imported 
after  the  liberalization  process  occurred  in  Asian  countries,  especially  China,  which  means  that  these 
countries are assembling goods in their territory to export to other countries. This is not surprising  as 
China has become the main manufacturing country in the world. 
Although  this  paper  has  shed  some  lights  on  the  impacts  of  China  in  exporting  firms  from  other 
developing  countries,  other  venues  should  be  explored.  For  instance,  outcomes  suggest  that  trade 
agreements  might  be  an  important  tool  to  mitigate  the  impact  in  trade  relations  originated  by  an 
exogenous  shock,  especially  by  the  increase  competition  from  other  countries.  However,  further 
research  should  be  pursued  in  order  to  confirm  this  hypothesis,  which  may  provide  an  additional 
argument to foster trade agreements between countries.

the Mexican case is definitely larger than the other two countries, although estimated elasticity is lower.
