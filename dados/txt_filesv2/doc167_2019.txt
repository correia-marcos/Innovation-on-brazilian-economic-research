Abstract 

Understanding consumers' long-run response to electricity prices is essential for efficient market 
regulations,  supplier  planning  decisions,  and  evaluation  of  economic  policies  for  the  economic 
development of the country. The long-run elasticities of residential energy demand are estimated 
for the five geographic regions in Brazil: North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and South, with 
monthly frequency from January 2003 to June 2015. We use a dynamic econometric model in a 
cointegration  setup  in  order  to  estimate  the  long-run  elasticities.  We  find  that  long-run  price-
elasticity is inelastic for each geographic region and that the region most sensitive to variations in 
price is the South.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Electricity is obtained from many energy sources and supplied to consumers via complex system, 
divided  into  three  steps:  generation,  transmission  and  distribution.  Brazil  has  plentiful  water 
resources and the main source of the nation‚Äôs electricity is hydropower. Electricity generation in 
Brazil  in  2015  had  the  following  breakdown1:  hydraulic  (61.9%);  natural  gas  (13.7%),  biomass 
(8.2%); petroleum derivatives; (4.4%), coal and derivatives (3.3%); nuclear (2.5%); wind (3.7%); 
and others (2.3%). 

Electricity supply is segmented by classes of consumers, among which the principal are residential, 
industrial  and  commercial.  In  the  period  analyzed  (2003-2015),  there  was  little  variation  in  the 
relative shares of the consumption classes, with averages of 43% by the industrial class, 25% by 
residential  consumers,  17%  by  commercial  users  and  15%  by  other  consumers.  The  residential 
segment is very important, since it is the second largest in terms of demand and is subject to strong 
influence of price fluctuations. The economic theory associated with the behavior of this type of 
consumer suggests that demand is generally more elastic to prices in the long term in relation to the 
short  run  (Topel  and  Rosen  (1998),  Athukorala and  Wilson  (2010)).  Residential  consumers  face 
resistances from some factors, such as replacement of durable goods and consumption habits that 
can take years to respond completely to price changes. This makes the response of demand to prices 
in the long run to significantly exceed the short-term response. 

The main objective of this work is to estimate the long-term price elasticity of residential demand 
for  electricity  in  Brazil,  segmented  by  the  five  official  geographic  regions  ‚Äì  North,  Northeast, 
Midwest,  Southeast  and  South  ‚Äì  during  the  period  from  January  2003  to  June  2015.  The 
investigation of the price elasticity is relevant for the electric power sector, where the actors make 
long-run decisions. For market regulators, forecasts of this elasticity are essential for the design of 
mechanisms  and  support  for  efficient  allocation.  For  generators  and  distributors,  optimized 
investment in capacity and infrastructure requires precise predictions of the long-range response of 
demand to  changes in  prices. In relation to policymakers, knowing the price elasticity is  vital to 
measure demand for electricity and direct investments for the economic development of the country. 
Therefore, estimating the long-run price elasticity can help generators, distributors and regulators 
make wise decisions about public policies for the electricity sector.  

In  this  study  we  also  estimate  the  long-run  elasticity  of  demand  to  income,  which  measures  the 
percentage variation in demand in relation of a change in income of consumers. We consider the 
influence  of  other  variables  on  residential  demand,  such  as  the  total  index  of  manufacture  of 
electrical machines, apparatuses and materials and the index of appliance prices. We also note that 
a part of the observed variation in prices is driven by specific events that affect demand in large 
geographic areas, such as during exceptionally hot summers. On the other hand, since the country‚Äôs 
electricity  is  predominantly  hydric,  the  variation  in  precipitation  can  affect  the  energy  price. 
Therefore, we consider the exogenous variables temperature and rainfall. 

 

A.  Related Work 

Various  studies  have  examined  residential  energy  demand  functions  using  cointegration 
techniques  to  estimate  the  long-run  elasticities.  The  results  and  implications  of  these  studies 
obviously depend on the econometric methods applied, the frequency of the data, the development 
stage  of  a  country  or  region  and  the  type  of  variables  considered.  Generally  they  are  based  on 
aggregated variables  of price  and  income  along with  some  additional  factors,  such  as  climate or

urbanization. We can mention the works of Athukorala and Wilson (2010) for Sri Lanka, De Vita, 
Endresen, and Hunt (2006) for Namibia; Narayan and Smyth (2005) for Australia; Galindo (2005) 
for  Mexico;  Kamerschen  and Porter  (2004)  for  the  USA,  and  Beenstock  et  al,  (1999)  for  Israel. 
Athukorala and Wilson (2010) investigated the short-term dynamics and the long-run equilibrium 
relations between residential electricity demand and factors that affect its behavior for the economy 
of Sri Lanka. Using annual data for the 1960-2007 period, they demonstrated that a long-run relation 
exists and found a long-run price elasticity of -0.62. Vita, et al. (2006) used data for the Namibian 
economy from 1980 to 2002 and the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach 
to  cointegration  to  estimate  the  long-run  energy  demand  elasticities.  With  inclusion  of  some 
exogenous variables such as temperature, they found a long-run price elasticity of -0.34. Galindo 
(2005)  estimated  the  demand  for  electricity  in  Mexico  for  different  types  of  consumption  in  the 
1965-2001 period. He found a small long-term price elasticity, of around -0.2. Narayan and Smyth 
(2005) estimated the long- and short-run elasticities of residential demand in Australia. The results 
showed a long-term elasticity of demand of -0.541 and short-term elasticity of -0.263. Kamerschen 
and Porter (2004) investigated the electricity demand for the residential and industrial classes in the 
United States in the period from 1973 to 1998. Using a simultaneous equations model, they found 
long-run  elasticity  between  -0.85  and  -0.94  for  the  residential  sector.  Beenstock,  et  al.  (1999) 
estimated demand in Israel using two dynamic models with cointegration restrictions and found that 
‚Äúthe long-run price elasticity of demand is -0.194 and -0.202‚Äù respectively. Other works related to 
this research are Achicanoy and Jimenez (2015), Dicembrino and Trovato (2013), Gonzalez et al 
(2012), Jim√©nez (2015), MohammadZadeh and Masoumi (2010) and Zadeh and Masoumi (2010). 

The literature for Brazil in this respect is sparse. We can mention the study of Schmidt and Lima  
(2004) and Irffi and Catelar (2009) as the most important. Schmidt and Lima (2004) estimated the 
price elasticity in the 1963-2000 period using annual data and concluded that the long-run elasticity 
of  demand  for  the  residential  class  is  -0.15.  Irffi  and  Catelar  (2009)  estimated  the  residential, 
commercial and industrial demand for electric energy in the Northeast of Brazil during the period 
1970-2003. They found that the demand is inelastic to price, with a value of -0.68.  

In this article, we contribute to the literature in two ways: bringing new evidence for residential 
demand  in  Brazil  with  monthly  frequency  data  and  estimating  the  long-run  elasticities  in  a 
disaggregated analysis in five geographic regions of Brazil. We also identify the effects of rain and 
temperature on demand. The results show that demand is inelastic to price, as found by studies in 
other countries, and that the region most sensitive to variations in price is the South. 

 

II.  METHODOLOGY 

A.  Demand model 

 

  The general form of the residential demand equation is:  
 

ùëë = ùëë(ùëù, ùëâ, ùë¢)  

 
Where ùëë is average consumption of electric energy, ùëù is the marginal electricity price, ùëâ is a vector 
of  all  other  relevant  variables  and ùë¢ is  a  disturbance  term.  Residential  demand  for  electricity  is 
driven  by  the  individual  needs  of  household  members,  whose  level  of  consumption  depends  on 
variables such as prices and income. We propose the following model to describe this demand: 
 

ùëëùë° = ùëòùëùùë°

ùõºùë¶ÃÉùë°

ùúÉùëíùë°

ùõæùëôùë°

ùõøùëíùë•ùëù(ùë¢ùë°),    ùëò > 0, ùõº < 0, ùúÉ > 0, ùõø < 0 , ùõæ > 0                  (1) 

Where: 

ùëëùë° : is the electricity consumption at time t; 
ùëùùë° ‚à∂ is the tariff (price) of electricity at time t; 
ùë¶ÃÉùë°: is the average household income at time t; 
ùëíùë°: is the index of production of machines and apparatuses at time t; and 
ùëôùë°: is the price of electrical appliances time t. 
ùë¢ùë°: is the disturbance term in time t. 

 
We use a modified residential electricity demand model in neperian logarithmic form. Taking the 
logarithm in equation (1), we have a linear demand equation:  
 

Logùëëùë°

ùëñ = ùêøùëúùëîùëòùëñ + Œ±ùëñ Log ùëùùë°

ùëñ + ùúÉùëñLog yÃÉùë°

ùëñ +Œ≥ùëñ Log ùëíùë°

ùëñ +   Œ¥ùëñ Log ùëôùë°

ùëñ + ùë¢ùë°                (2)   

 
ùëñ + ùë¢ùë°. We use equation (2) to estimate the 
or expressed as ùê∑ùë°
demand function. We add the sub-index ùëñ to identify a model for each of the five regions of the 
country: North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and South. 
 

ùëñ = ùêæùëñ + Œ±ùëñ ùëÉùë°

ùëñ + Œ≥ùëñ ùê∏ùë°

ùëñ + ùúÉùëñ ùëåùë°

ùëñ + Œ¥ùëñùêøùë°

B.  Econometric model 

  Some caution needs to be taken to estimate the long-run relationship with non-stationary time-
series data. The treatment in this case leads us to deal with the series with first differences before 
any estimation is done. The major problem with this procedure, however, is that by taking the first 
differences, the low frequencies are eliminated from the data, leaving only one model capable of 
explaining  the short-term  relationships.  In  this  paper,  we  argue  that  since energy  prices  and  real 
income appear to be non-stationary processes, econometric modeling of energy can be successful 
through cointegration analysis with error correction. Consider a Gaussian vector autoregression of 
finite order p, VAR(p): 

 ùë¶ùë° = ùúô1ùë¶ùë°‚àí1 + ùúô2ùë¶ùë°‚àí2 + ‚ãØ + ùúôùëùùë¶ùë°‚àíùëù + ùúÄùë°                              (3)                   

where ùë¶ùë° is  a  vector  of  n  first-order  integrated  I(1)  and  endogenous  variables, ùúôùëñ = 1, ‚Ä¶ , ùëù are 
matrices  of  dimension  n √ó n  and  ùúÄùë°~ùëÅùëúùëüùëöùëéùëô (0, Œ©) ,  ùê∏(ùúÄùë°) = 0 ,  ùê∏(ùúÄùë°ùúÄùúè) = {Œ©, ùë†ùëí ùë° = ùúè  and 
0ùëõ√óùëõ, if  ùë° ‚â† ùúè}; where Œ© is not singular. The model (1) can be written equivalently as: 
 

  Œ† (ùêø)ùë¶ùë° =   ùúÄùë°                                                                      (4)                                                     

ùëù
ùëñ=1

 is  a  polynomial  matrix  in ùêø,  and ùêø represents  the  lag  operator. 

Where Œ† (ùêø) = ùêºùëõ ‚àí ‚àë ùúôùëñùêøùëñ
ùëù
Furthermore, Œ† (1) = ùêºùëõ ‚àí ‚àë ùúôùëñ
ùëñ=1
 
The demand can be represented by a VAR(p) model with ùëõ = 5 stacked variables in the vector ùë¶ùë° =
[ùê∑ùë° ùëÉùë° ùëåùë° ùê∏ùë° ùêøùë° ]‚Ä≤ .  Considering  the  polynomial  transformation  Œ† (ùêø) =  Œ† (1)ùêø + Œ†‚àó(ùêø)‚àÜ  in  the 
VAR(p) model given by equation (4), where ‚àÜ‚â° (1 ‚àí ùêø), we can rewrite it as: 

 when ùêø = 1. 

‚àÜùë¶ùë° = ‚àíŒ† (1)ùë¶ùë°‚àí1 +  ‚àë Œìùëó

ùëó=1

Equation  (5)  is  known  as  the  vector  error  correction  model  (VECM)  or  error  correction  model 
(ECM).  The  parameters  of  the  first-difference  variables  represent  the  short-term  components, 
whereas the parameters of the variable in level (ùë¶ùë°‚àí1) denote the long-run coefficients.  
 
c.1 Long-run restrictions (cointegration) 
 
  The following hypotheses are assumed: 
 
Assumption 1: The (n √ó n) matrix Œ† (‚àô)  satisfies:  
 

1.  ùëüùëéùëõùëò( Œ† (1)) = ùëü, 0 < ùëü < ùëõ such that Œ† (1) can be expressed as Œ† (1) = ‚àíùõºùõΩ‚Ä≤, where ùõº 

and ùõΩ are (n √ó r) matrices with full column rank r. 

2.  The characteristic equation |Œ† (1)| = 0 has ùëõ ‚àí ùëü roots equal to 1 and all others are outside 

the unit circle. 

  Assumption  1  implies  that ùë¶ùë°  is  cointegrated  with  order  (1,  1).  The  elements  of ùõº  are  the 
adjustment  coefficients  and  the  columns  of ùõΩ  span  the  cointegration  space.  Decomposing  the 
polynomial matrix Œ†(ùêø) = Œ† (1)ùêø + Œ†(ùêø)‚àÜ, where ‚àÜ= (1 ‚àí ùêø) is the difference operator, a vector 
error correction model (VECM) is obtained: 
 

         ‚àÜùë¶ùë° = ùõºùõΩ‚Ä≤ùë¶ùë°‚àí1 +  ‚àë Œìùëó

ùëù‚àí1

ùëó=1

‚àÜùë¶ùë°‚àíùëó + ùëãùë°‚Ä≤ùúë + ùúÄùë°                              (6) 

ùúôùë†

ùëù
ùë†=j+1

 
where  ùõΩ‚Ä≤ = ‚àíŒ† (1)  ,  Œìùëó = ‚àë
  (ùëó = 1, ‚Ä¶ , ùëù ‚àí 1)  and  Œì0 = ùêºùëõ .  If  we  add  ùëö  exogenous 
variables, ùëãùë°, in equation (3), equation (5) can be expressed as equations (6), where ùúë is a vector 
of ùëö √ó 1 dimension. For instance, if rainfall (rain) and temperature (temp) are add in model, ùëãùë° is 
‚Ä≤ = [ùëüùëéùëñùëõùë°, ùë°ùëíùëöùëùùë°]‚Ä≤ .  So,  we  can  obtain  the  long-run  elasticity  from  long-run 
defined  as  ùëãùë°
ùëñ and 
relationships ùõΩ‚Ä≤ùë¶ùë°‚àí1 by estimation of the ECM. By normalizing the cointegration vector in ùê∑ùë°
considering  a  constant  in  the  cointegration  vector,  we  can  denote  the  deviations  from  long-run 
equilibrium for each region ùëñ as:  
 

ùõΩùëñ‚Ä≤ùë¶ùë°‚àí1

The  series  of  average  consumption  (ùê∑ùë° ),  in  MWh,  and  the  electricity  tariff  (ùëÉùë° ),  in  R$2,  were 
obtained from the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL). The index of appliance production 
(ùê∏ùë°) was obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). For the price of 
appliances in time (ùêøùë°), we use the Comprehensive Consumer Price Index (IPCA), also computed 

2 Brazil‚Äôs  currency  is  the  Real  (R$).  Over  the  study  period  of  this  paper,  the  exchange  rate  with  the  dollar  fluctuated  in  an  interval  between 
approximately R$1.56/US$ and R$ 3.97/US$, with a rough average of R$ 2.28/US$. 

                                                           

by the (IBGE), as a proxy. The average household income (ùëåùë°) was also obtained from the IBGE, 
based on the Monthly Employment Survey (PME). The average rainfall series was obtained from 
the  company  Della Coletta  Bioenergia.  Notice  that  capital  letter indicates variables  expressed in 
logarithm.  Finally,  the  mean  temperature  series  was  obtained  from  the  National  Institute  of 
Meteorology (INMET).  Figure 1 shows the graphs of aggregate residential demand. It can be seen 
that  the  region  with  the  highest  consumption  is  the  Southeast.  The  demand  in  each  region  is 
associated with its wealth. The Southeast is the richest and most populated, covering the states of 
Esp√≠rito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo.  
 
Figure 2 shows the average price by region. The price of electricity generally increased in the period 
analysed, with a particularly large increase in 2015, due to increase in rates in reaction to the low 
reservoir levels caused by the shortage of rainfall in 2014.

A.  Unit root tests 
The vector ùë¶ùë° in equation (1) is defined as of n first-order integrated I(1). So, we proceed to unit 
root test. Table I reports the results of these tests. The results show the presence of unit roots in the 
series on demand (ùê∑ùë°), price (ùëÉùë°) and income (ùëåùë°) in all the regions. The variables ùê∏ùë° and  ùêøùë° also 
have  a  unit  root 3 ,  as  do  all  the  variables  that  compose  the  vector ùë¶ùë° = [ùê∑ùë° ùëÉùë° ùëåùë° ùê∏ùë° ùêøùë° ]‚Ä≤,  i.e., 
ùë¶ùë°~ùêº(1). Hence, the first condition is satisfied. The next step is to test the existence of a long-run 
relation of these variables. For this purpose, we identified the order of lags of the VAR(p) model 
according to the Akaike, Schwarz and Hannan-Quinn information criteria. The results show that 
ùëù = 1 for all the regions.

B.  Resultads of the long-run elasticities 

 

Table III presents the estimated long-run elasticities of demand to price and income. It can be 
observed that demand is inelastic in relation to electricity price and also to income. The majority of 
the  coefficients  related  to  price  are  not  statistically  significant.  This  implies  that  the  long-run 
elasticity is perfectly inelastic. Despite this, some insights can be obtained through these results. In 
relation  to  income,  most  of  the  regions  had  statistically  significant  parameters.  Moreover,  the 
demand is only elastic in the North region. This means it is more sensitive than in the Midwest, 
Southeast,  Northeast  and  South  regions.  This  behavior  of  sensitivity  of  demand  in  function  of 
income variations can be explained by the need to operate devices incorporated in people‚Äôs lifestyle. 
Another  explanation  can  be  attributed  to  the  increased  acquisition  of  electrical  and  electronic 
appliances  with  rising  income,  requiring  households  to  consume  more  electricity  to  use  them. 
Observation of the values estimated in relation to the regions provides the following insights:  

The Midwest region has a higher impact of price on consumption of electricity, with an elasticity 
value of -0.018 measuring the sensitivity of consumers when price increases. This means that on 
average an increase in price of 1% among consumers causes a decrease of 0.018% in  electricity 
demand. The result in the Northwest is -0.038, characterizing inelastic demand in relation to price. 
This  means  that  the  variation  in  price  does  not  have  a  meaningful  influence  on  electricity 
consumption:  a  price  increase  of  1%  reduces  demand  by  0.038%.  The  inverse  occurs  with  an 

increase of income, although the result is also inelastic, but with a significant increase in demand 
with  rising  income  in  the  region:  a  1%  increase  in  income  raises  demand  by  0.916%.  Since  the 
region  has  many  low-income  people  who  do  not  have  many  appliances  that  need  electricity  to 
operate,  when  income  rises,  so  does  ownership  of  appliances,  and  consequently  demand  for 
electricity. Our income elasticity result for the Northeast is close to that of 0.876 obtained by Irffi 
and Catelar  (2009) in the same region.  

In the North, demand is also inelastic in relation to price, but the sensitivity is higher than found in 
the regions mentioned above. Here an increase of 1% in price causes a decline of 0.13% in demand. 
Income in this region, unlike in the others, is elastic, with a result greater than unity. Therefore, an 
increase of 1% in income leads to a rise of 1.05% in electricity demand. As in the Northeast, the 
North also has pent-up demand for electrical and electronic appliances, so higher income spurs the 
purchase of these devices and thus increases energy demand. Another characteristic of the region is 
that many households still do not have access to electricity, despite rural electrification initiatives 
such as the ‚ÄúLight for All‚Äù program, according to the Ministry of Mines and Energy.

In the Southeast, consumers are inelastic in relation to income. An increase of 1% in income causes 
demand  to  rise  by  0.39%.  This  region  is  the  richest  in  the  country,  with  virtually  universal 
connection  to  the  power  grid,  so  the  use  of  appliances  is  commensurately  greater,  for  which 
electricity is essential.  

In the South, as in the other regions, the signs are in accordance with those found in the literature. 
Demand is inelastic with respect to price, because a rise of 1% in price causes demand to fall by 
0.19%. In turn, the relation between demand and income is inelastic: an increase of 1% in income 
leads demand to rise by 0.56%.  

 

 

 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

The aim of this paper is to estimate the long-run price and income elasticity of demand for residential 
electricity in Brazil for each of the country‚Äôs five geographical regions.  

The  results  found  demonstrate  that  demand  is  inelastic  to  price,  as  found  by  studies  in  other 
countries, and that the region most sensitive to variations in price is the South. An increase of 1% 
in the cost of electricity causes consumers to reduce demand by 0.018% in the Midwest, 0.038% in 
the Northeast, 0.134% in the North, 0.056% in the Southeast and 0,193% in the South.  

With respect to income elasticity, the results show that demand for electricity is elastic in the North 
and  inelastic  in  the  other  regions.  An  increase  of  1%  in  income  causes  increased  electricity 
consumption of 0.7% in the Midwest, 0.91% in the Northeast, 1.05% in the North, 0.39% in the 
Southeast and 0.56% in the South. Therefore, demand for electricity is most sensitive to variations 
of income in the North and Northeast.
