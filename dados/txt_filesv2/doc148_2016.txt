The  underlying  geographical  structure  of  global  value  chains  is  the  object  of  study  in  the  paper.  Our 
objective is elucidating this geographical structure, with special attention to the spatial interdependencies 
of  Brazilian  states,  by  means  of  the  hierarchical  feedback  loop  methodology.  In  essence,  this 
methodology  offers  a  detailed  view  of  economic  interactions,  first  by  identifying  the  paths  of  influence 
across regions,  and then  by proposing a hierarchical  extraction method to  identify the paths  in  terms of 
their  economic  importance.  The  application  in  our  paper  differs  from  previous  studies  adopting  this 
methodology as it takes  into account  value-added flows involved in  the supply chains. The hierarchical 
feedback  loop  methodology  is  applied  to  a  novel  country-state  input-output  table,  covering  the  27 
Brazilian states and 39 foreign countries (and the rest of the world as another country), for the year 2008. 
In our empirical results, a great degree of production sharing among the Brazilian states is also observed. 
The results indicate that fragmentation within great regions is a major phenomenon for the Southeast and 
(secondary  to  the  links  with  São  Paulo)  the  South  regions.  For  states  elsewhere  in  the  country,  supply 
chain  connections  with  the  more  developed  states  in  Brazil  overshadows  production  sharing  with 
neighbouring  states.  At  global  level,  a  spatial  structure  is  observed  where  the  flows  linking  major 
economies  across  trade  blocks  are  dominant.  Therefore,  our  results  support  the  observation  that 
production  fragmentation  is  a  truly  global  phenomenon,  not  being  merely  circumscribed  to  trading 
blocks. 
 
A estrutura geográfica subjacente às cadeias de valor globais é o objeto de estudo do presente trabalho. 
O objetivo é elucidar tal estrutura geográfica, com especial atenção às interdependências espaciais dos 
estados  brasileiros,  por  meio  da  metodologia  de  feedback  loop  hierárquico.  Essencialmente,  essa 
metodologia  provê  uma  visão  detalhada  das  interações  econômicas,  primeiramente  identificando  as 
trajetórias  de  influências  das  regiões  e,  então,  propondo  um  método  de  extração  hierárquica  para 
classificar  tais  trajetórias  em  termos  de  sua  importância  econômica.  A  aplicação  do  presente  trabalho 
difere  de  estudos  anteriores  que  adotaram  a  metodologia  ao  analisar  os  fluxos  de  valor  adicionado 
envolvidos nas cadeias globais, tais como representados em um novo modelo de insumo-produto países-
estados, abrangendo os 27 estados brasileiros e 39 países estrangeiros (e o resto do mundo como região 
adicional),  para  o  ano  2008.  Nos  resultados  empíricos,  um  elevado  grau  de  compartilhamento  da 
produção é observado entre os estados brasileiros. Os resultados indicam que a fragmentação produtiva 
dentro  das  grandes  regiões  é  um  fenômeno  importante  para  as  regiões  Sudeste  e  (secundariamente  às 
ligações com São Paulo) Sul. Para os estados nas demais regiões, as ligações produtivas com os estados 
mais desenvolvidos do país superam as ligações com os estados vizinhos. Em nível global, é observada 
uma  estrutura  espacial  em  que  são  dominantes  os  fluxos  entre  as  grandes  economias  em  diferentes 
blocos de comércio; os resultados indicam que a fragmentação produtiva é um fenômeno de fato global, 
não circunscrito aos blocos regionais.

1. Introduction 
 

Over  the  last  few  decades,  the  fragmentation  of  production  processes  has  redefined  comparative 
advantages  at  global  level,  inducing  great  changes  in  the  spatial  location  and  organization  of  economic 
activity.  At  the  same  time,  the  reorganization  of  value  chains  generated  a  complex  system  of 
interdependent flows, linking regions all over the world. As the process of fragmentation continues, inter-
regional  dependency  will  assume  even  greater  importance  in  explaining  the  growth  and  path  of 
development  of  economies  (HEWINGS;  OOSTERHAVEN,  2015).  Therefore,  there  is  increasing 
relevance  in  studying  the  spatial  organization  of  production  systems,  a  topic  that  has  not  received 
sufficient attention in the literature. 

For  studying  production  fragmentation  across  space,  the  inter-regional  input-output  (IO) 
methodology  constitutes  a  natural  and  important  analytical  framework.  In  this  paper,  our  objective  is 
elucidating the geographical structure of global value chains’ (GVCs) flows by means of the hierarchical 
feedback loop analysis. In essence, this methodology offers a detailed view of economic interactions by 
first identifying the paths of influence across regions and then proposing a hierarchical extraction method 
to identify the paths in terms of their economic importance flows (POLENSKE; HEWINGS, 2004). 

The  hierarchical  feedback  loop  methodology  has  already  been  applied  for  analyzing  the  spatial 
structure  of  gross  trade  flows  within  Europe  (SONIS  et  al,  1993),  Asia  (SONIS  et  al,  1995),  and  the 
Midwest  region  in the  USA (SEO  et al, 2002).  It has  also  been employed for identifying the  economic 
interactions  among  industries  within  Chicago  region  (LIU;  HEWINGS,  2014).  Our  paper  focuses  on 
supply  chain  dependencies  of  the  27  Brazilian  states,  but  also  taking  into  account  their  linkages  with 
producers  abroad.  This  is  relevant  as  international  and  inter-state  fragmentation  are  fundamentally 
interconnected  and  trends  in  local  income  have  recently  become  much  more  dependent  on  the  extent 
subnational  regions  manage  to  contribute  to  GVCs    (LOS  et  al,  2015).  In  this  way,  our  analysis 
distinguishes  67  regions  in  the  world,  comprising  the  global  economy,  as  in  the  year  2008.  Another 
differential  is  that instead of gross trade  analysis, which problems  of double-counting  are serious in  the 
presence  of  production  fragmentation  (KOOPMAN  et  al,  2014),  we  consider  the  value-added  flows 
involved in global production processes.  
 
The remainder of this paper is  organized as follows.  In the rest  of this  Introduction, background 
perspectives are provided on how the fragmentation of production processes leads to a reorganization of 
economic  activities  around  the  globe  and  within  countries.  In  section  2,  the  hierarchical  feedback  loop 
methodology is explored. Section 3 presents our results, exploring the relevance of spatial fragmentation 
for  each  region  considered  and  then  identifying  the  spatial  structure  of  the  main  supply  chains  flows  at 
global level. Section 4 concludes.   
 
1.1. Fragmentation and spatial reorganization of production systems 
 

According to Krugman (2011), the world economic history can be staged as a play in three acts: 
“the fall and rise of comparative advantage”. In Act I, before World War I, trade was primarily between 
countries  with  very  different  resources  exporting  very  different  products,  so  this  trade  fitted  the 
comparative  advantage  paradigm  well.  In  Act  II,  comprising  the  recovery  of  international  flows  after 
World War II, trade between similar countries became dominant. To explain the increasing intra-industry 
trade, the existence of advantages of specialization due to increasing returns was stated. However, in Act 
III  starting  in  the  1990s,  comparative  advantage  staged  a  comeback:  more  and  more  world  trade  take 
places  between  countries  at  different  levels  of  development,  with  different  resources,  factor  prices  and 
technologies. 

The role of technological developments in connecting services activities for global fragmentation 
is  emphasized  by  Jones  and  Kierzkowski  (2005).  The  authors  indicate  that  the  new  comparative 
advantages  came  into  play  in  world  production  systems  due  to  the  lowering  of  costs  for  service  link 
activities,  such  as  communication  and  transportation.  In  their  pioneer  general  framework  for  analyzing 
fragmentation  (JONES;  KIERZKOWSKI,  1990),  the  authors  highlight  how  production  processes  are 
being split into subsequent production blocks that are undertaken separately in the space, and need to be 

3 

 
connected  by  service  links.  Differing  from  the  new  economic  geography  (NEG)  literature,  under  the 
authors’ fragmentation paradigm it is not the firm that present (internal) increasing returns, but the service 
links. This leads to an important reversal of the view often expressed in NEG literature that increases in 
the  level  of  economic  activity  leads  to  spatial  agglomeration  of  such  activity.  Under  the  fragmentation 
framework, increases in the scale of production might encourage its fragmentation. 

In  the  simplified  version  of  the  model,  Jones  and  Kierzkowski  (2005)  assume  that  the  services 
links exhibit increasing returns associated with fixed costs invariant to the scale of output.  1 For a given 
degree of fragmentation of the production process, the nature of service links leads to average costs that 
are decreasing with total output. Further increases in output encourages a finer degree of fragmentation in 
order  to  reduce  production  costs  if  the  extra  cost  of  the  service  links  is  more  than  balanced  by  lower 
marginal  costs  obtained  by  a  closer  match  of  factor  intensities  with  net  factor  productivities.  In  the 
aggregate,  average  costs  of  production  decrease  with  output  for  a  given  degree  of  fragmentation,  and 
marginal  costs  decrease  discontinuously  at  the  point  the  degree  of  fragmentation  is  increased.  Thus, 
lowering  of  costs  for  service  links  promotes  greater  spatial  separation  of  production  processes,  for  any 
output level. Increases in the scale of production might also encourage the dis-agglomeration of economic 
activity,  with  consequential  increased  trade  of  intermediates,  at  both  international  and  inter-regional 
levels. 

Therefore,  a  central  point  in  the  fragmentation  paradigm  is  that  each  production  block  can  be 
carried out in the best possible location. Differences in productivities and factor prices then become very 
relevant  for  the  determination  of  the  geographical  pattern  of  production  (JONES;  KIERZKOWSKI, 
2005).  As  indicated  by  Romero  et  al  (2009),  the  multinational  corporations  are  currently  reconsidering 
where to locate their plants, based on the regional characteristics such as cost of production factors, size 
of  internal  markets  and  regulatory  issues.  Therefore,  globalization  is  bringing  about  significant 
transformation  of  international  and  inter-regional  division  of  labor,  which  is  altering  the  geography  of 
production around the world.  

We might ask, however, what is the extent of the spatial re-organization of production systems.  

Baldwin  (2006)  indicates  that  the  fundamental  forces  that  have  fostered  international  fragmentation  of 
production – reduction in costs of moving ideas, products, and people, i.e. the service links of Jones and 
Kierzkowski  (2005)  –  might  result  in  regionalized  fragmentation.  According  to  the  author,  because  the 
reduction in the cost of moving ideas (due to large technological advancements in communications) has 
greatly surpassed the reduction in the cost of shipping products and even more that of passenger transport 
(given increasing opportunity cost of time of skilled staff), regionalizing off-shoring is a way of saving of 
the  costs  of  trade.  In  this  context,  the  literature  discusses  whether  the  international  fragmentation  of 
production  processes  is  actually  global,  involving  countries  that  are  geographically  distant,  or  mainly 
regional, taking place between neighboring countries or within regional trade blocks. As indicated by Los 
et al (2014), this has important implications for trade policy. In the case fragmentation is a truly  global 
phenomenon,  extensive  multilateral  trade  agreements  are  required  to  enhance  the  production  benefits 
from supply chain trade; if not, regional trade arrangements might be sufficient.  

The  empirical  evidence  on  this  matter  is  mixed.  Johnson  and  Noguera  (2012b),  based  on  their 
series  of  global  IO  tables  for  1970-2009,  find  that  value  added  to  exports  (VAX)  ratios  are  lower  and 
falling  more  rapidly  over  time  among  countries  within  geographical  regions,  which  suggests 
regionalization  of  production  processes  to  be  more  important  than  globalization.2  In  the  same  sense, 
Baldwin  and  Lopez-Gonzalez (2014, p. 14) claim  that “supply chain  trade is  not  global  – it is  regional. 
‘Global value chains’ is  a great buzzword but it is inaccurate in aggregate”. Such claim is based on the 
observation that international gross trade flows within regions are much larger than those across regions, 
as depicted on the tables from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) project. On the other hand, also 
based  on  WIOD,  Los  et  al  (2014)  argue  that  trends  toward  regional  fragmentation  might  have  been 

                                                           
1  According  to  the  authors,  it  makes  more  sense  with  communications,  but  transportation  costs  are  also  declining  with 
quantities transported. 
2 See Johnson and Noguera (2012c) for detail on the dataset. The author combine data from several sources for constructing the 
global input-output tables, including  the OECD Input-Output Database,  the IDE-JETRO Asian Input-Output Tables, and the 
UN Trade Database. The dataset is organized for four composite industries, covering 42 countries.

dominant in the 1980s and early-1990s, but that true global fragmentation has been more important in the 
2000s. The authors find that in almost all product chains, the share of value added outside the country-of-
completion has increased since 1995, which indicates increasing international  fragmentation. Moreover, 
they find that this share is mainly added outside the region to which the country-of-completions belongs, 
suggesting that value chains are truly global. 

In our analysis of the spatial organization of GVCs, we will assess the fragmentation of production 
processes both within and across blocks of countries (here, NAFTA, EU27, and East Asia), as in the year 
2008.  By  means  of  the  feedback  loop  approach,  the  bilateral  supply  linkages  will  be  evaluated 
hierarchically at global level. 
 
1.2. Inter-regional trade under the fragmentation paradigm 
 

In our application, we are especially  interested in  fragmentation within countries, i.e. production 
sharing  between  subnational  regions.  For  Krugman  (2015),  within  the  USA  the  ability  to  slice  up  the 
value chain is not going to lead to a significant rise in inter-regional trade. In this way, the explosion of 
international trade is not matched by comparable growth in inter-regional trade. According to the author, 
the regions in the USA are homogenizing, so they have less reason to trade with each other than once did. 
So,  “to  the  extent  that  Americans  are  doing  pretty  much  the  same  thing  everywhere,  the  rationale  for 
specialization  and  inter-regional  trade  is  reduced”  (KRUGMAN,  2015,  p.  33).  However,  if  contrary  to 
Friedman, the world is not flat (KRUGMAN, 2015), the world inside nations is not flat either, but rather 
space is spiky and uneven (HEWINGS; OOSTERHAVEN, 2015). This is especially valid for a country 
like Brazil, which we focus in our empirical application and is heterogeneous in several aspects.  

Jones  and  Kierzkowski  (2005)  note  that  international  trade  allows  a  greater  degree  of 
concentration  of  productive  activity  nationally,  often  in  urban  areas,  as  it  cuts  the  dependence  of  local 
consumption upon a corresponding range of local production, so that distance to market loses some of its 
importance.  Alternatively,  while  at  the  international  level  the  possibilities  to  fragment  production 
processes  allow  more  countries  to  join  the  supply  chains,  leading  to  dispersal  of  productive  activity, 
increases in levels of international trade may encourage national agglomeration.  

Thus,  under  the  fragmentation  paradigm,  when  the  benefits  of  agglomeration  exceed  those  of 
spatial  fragmentation  (due  to  a  closer  match  elsewhere  between  factor  intensities  and  net  factor 
productivities),  the  firms  find  it  more  profitable  to  locate  close.  However,  if  significant  differences  in 
productivities  and  factor  prices  are  to  be  found  at  regional  level,  according  to  Parr  et  al  (2002), 
agglomeration  economies  are  supplemented  and  perhaps  replaced  by  less-spatially  constrained 
advantages.  

The  authors  emphasize  the  significant  role  being  played  by  changes  in  firm  organization  (with 
most plants now being part of multiregional enterprises) in conditioning location decisions. In the single-
establishment firm, economies of scale, scope and complexity, if realizable, would only be available at a 
particular geographic location, and any one of these would form the basis for an agglomeration economy. 
However, the changing relationship between the establishment and the firm has resulted in economies of 
scope and complexity being realized at the level of the firm, while specific product economies of scale are 
exploited  within  individual  establishments  with  the  best  possible  location.  With  this,  the  ties  that  once 
bound establishments in close spatial proximity seem to be unravelling in favor of spatial association at 
multi-state level (PARR et al, 2002).  

The schematic process is illustrated in Figure 1. With high costs for transportations (i.e. Jones and 
Kierzkowski’s service links),  market  areas were  limited and thus  the ability to  explore scale economies 
were spatially circumscribed. As a result, each establishment often produced more than one product in a 
given  location.  Declining  transportation  costs  and  changes  in  firm  organization  brought  about  intra-
establishment  specialization,  with  drastic  transformation  of  the  spatial  structure  of  production.  Value 
chain  now  involves  more  interstate  movements.  With  the  boost  in  interstate  trade  flows,  the  main 
implication of these changes is  an increase in inter-regional spillover and feedback effects (HEWINGS; 
OOSTERHAVEN, 2015).

Therefore,  regions  are  becoming  both  more  competitive  and  interdependent  over  time,  so  that 
understanding the spatial structure of production across subnational regions and countries is increasingly 
relevant. In our empirical application, we will analyze the spatial organization of value chains across the 
Brazilian  states.  In  Brazil,  the  geographical  heterogeneity  results  in  diverse  regional  competitive 
advantages,  many  of  them  aroused  by  natural  endowments.  This  also  adds  to  the  complexity  of  inter-
regional  dependency.  Here  we  are  not  interested  so  much  in  the  generating  factors  of  regional 
interdependency, but in recognizing its spatial pattern as in 2008. 
 
2. Methodology  
 

In this paper, we focus on the spatial organization of production processes. Note that, in contrast 
to  trade  in  value  added  (TiVA)  studies,  we  are  not  interested  in  a  country’s  contribution  to  final 
consumption,  but  in  its  contribution  to  the  output  value  of  a  given  consumption  good.  Several 
methodologies can be employed for analyzing inter-regional and intersectoral dependencies. In this paper, 
we address the identification and interpretation of global economic structure by means of the hierarchical 
feedback  loop  analysis  of  value  added  flows  within  GVCs.  In  essence,  this  approach  offers  a  more 
detailed view of economic interactions by first identifying the paths of influence across regions and then 
proposing  a  hierarchical  extraction  method  to  identify  the  paths  in  terms  of  their  economic  importance 
flows (POLENSKE; HEWINGS, 2004). In this paper, we analyze the macro-level (where all transactions 
are aggregated into one industry) structure of the feedback loops.  

For our empirical analysis, we apply the full country-state IO table that was estimated for the year 
2008. It follows the procedure that was proposed by Dietzenbacher et al (2013) for combining a world IO 
table (WIOT) with an inter-regional IO table (IRIOT), thus estimating a country-state IO table for Brazil. 
In this approach, we do not to take one of the datasets (say the WIOT) as a starting point and adapt the 
other dataset (i.e. the IRIOT) accordingly, instead we construct input coefficients for which both datasets 
are used. We use the WIOT for 2008 that was constructed in the WIOD project (see Dietzenbacher et al, 
2013b).3  It  is  a  full  inter-country  IO  table  covering  40  countries  and  the  rest  of  the  world  as  a  41st 
“country”.4 One of the countries included is Brazil. The IRIOT for 2008 is  for Brazil and covers the 27 
Brazilian states (GUILHOTO et al, 2010).

Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, 

 
 
2.1. Supply chains’ value added flows 
 

From  the  basic  Leontief  model,  the  total  output  of  an  economy  can  be  expressed  as  the  sum  of 

intermediate consumption and final consumption (MILLER; BLAIR (2009)) as 

           
(     )

where   is the n×1 total output vector (n is the number of industries in the system),   is the n×n direct 
input  coefficients  matrix,     is  the  n×1  final  demand  vector,  and     is  the  Leontief  inverse  matrix. 
Considering   as the n×n diagonal matrix of value added coefficients, we can describe the value added 
related input-output model as: 
 
from (3): 
 
where   is the n×1 value added vector. 
 
In  our  empirical  analysis,  we  applied  a  state-country  input-output  model.  In  this  way,  the 
dimensions of the above matrices and vectors become: a)  ,  , and  , size [(r.n) × 1]; b)  ,  , and  , size 
(r.n) × (r.n).  
Having in mind the definition of a GVC of final good according to Timmer et al (2015) (the set of 
 
value-adding activities needed in its production, and identified by the country-industry in which the last 
stage  of  production  happens),  we  are  interested  in  the  spatial  structure  of  value  added  flows  from  each 
region to each GVC in the world economy.  In order to estimate these flows, we construct  the   (r.n) × 
(r.n) diagonal matrix of final demand, which elements correspond to the sum of a given industry’s  final 
demand across destination regions (either domestic or foreign). Then, we compute 
 
where   is the (r.n) × (r.n) matrix of supply chain’s value added flows.

Figure  2  illustrates  the  framework  for  the  supply  chain’s  value  added  flows  as  represented  in 
matrix  . For the value chain of the final product t with completion in the region j, we define the foreign 
value added as all value added outside the region of completion j: 

 

    ∑ ∑    

  

 

    
  
Here,     

   

 
  is  the  value  added  generated  directly  and  indirectly  in  industry  s  of  region  i  for  the 
production of final products by industry j of region t, i.e. in the GVC of industry j of region t. There is one 
column for each GVC, characterized by the region-industry of completion, with cells showing the origin 
of value added. The sum across all industries participating in a GVC is equal to the gross output value of 
the  final  product,  given  by  the  bottom  row.  Since  final  output  values  equal  global  expenditure  on  the 
product, the summation of final output across columns equals world GDP, measured from the expenditure 
side. A given row in Figure 2 represents the value-added from a given region-industry to all GVCs. Thus, 
the  summation  across  the  row,  depicted  in  the  final  column,  equals  the  value  added  in  an  industry. 
Summed across all industries, this equals  world  GDP, measured from the production side (TIMMER  et 
al, 2015).

2.2. Hierarchical feedback loop analysis 
 

In  our  empirical  application,  we  apply  the  hierarchical  feedback  loop  approach  developed  by 

Sonis and Hewings (1988, 1991) to facilitate the identification of the spatial structure of the GVCs.5 

We consider the (r.n) × (r.n) block matrix  , of supply chain’s value added flows: 

 

      (

             
             

 

 

 

 

             

) 

where each block 
      ‖   

  ‖ 

 
represents the value added from sectors in region i to the GVCs of region j. Define: 

   

   

(7) 

(8) 

  
      ∑    

  

 
as the sum of flows between all industries within each submatrix    . Hence, the r×r matrix of aggregate 
flows is defined as: 

(9) 

   

 

    ‖   ‖ 
(10) 
The major focus of our empirical application in this paper is the identification of feedback loops 
that reveal the economic influence of each region. A series of aggregate transactions is specified such that 
each region is allowed precisely one transaction flow entering it and one flow leaving it. Such a series of 
transactions is called “feedback loop”, since each and every region influences itself at the end of the loop. 
A feedback loop is complete if it includes all regions. A complete feedback loop is either closed or can be 
decomposed into a set of closed subloops. If the entering flow and the leaving flow for the same region 
are  identical,  the  smallest  closed  subloop  possible  has  been  identified,  i.e.  the  influence  that  a  region 
directly exerts on itself, its domestic self-influence. 

 

Economically, a series of transactions represents a chain of bilateral influences which are based on 
either backward or forward linkages. Thus, the economic meaning of a feedback loop is indicating how 
strongly (at each hierarchical level) each region is connected to all other regions included in the loop. By 
focusing on complete loops, one can evaluate the place and position of each region relative to all others. 

For a set of n regions, the amount of all complete feedback loops is equal to n!. One method for 
dealing  with  this  large  amount  of  complete  feedback  loops  is  the  derivation  of  some  hierarchical 
structure. Essentially, the hierarchical  feedback loop approach, proposed  by Sonis  and Hewings  (1988), 
                                                           
5 This section draws on Sonis et al (1995).

extracts  complete  feedback  loops  that  successively  account  for  the  largest  possible  sum  of  transaction 
flows  in  each  stage  of  the  selection  process.  This  procedure  continues  until  all  transaction  flows  have 
been included. 

A  complete  feedback  loop  is  presented  by  a  submatrix      of  flows  extracted  from  the  matrix 
    ‖   ‖ of aggregate transaction flows.    must include in each row and in each column precisely one 
non-zero entry from the matrix   and zeros elsewhere. Replacing all the non-zero entries of    by units, a 
so-called permutation matrix    is obtained, corresponding to a permutation of the sequence of numbers 
1,  2,  …,  r.  This  permutation  (of  regions)  represents  the  structure  of  the  flows  in  the  corresponding 
feedback loop. Hence, the submatrix    is referred to as a quasi-permutation matrix. Moreover, the flow 
intensity of a complete feedback loop (  ) is defined as the sum of all transaction flows of   . 

Within  the  hierarchical  feedback  loop  approach,  the  hierarchy  of  complete  feedback  loops  is 
defined  as the sequence  of quasi-permutation submatrices     chosen according to the  rank-size of their 
flow intensities   . Thus, on the top of the hierarchy, one finds the complete feedback loop with maximal 
flow intensity. The procedure is summarized in the following steps: 

  Step  1:  For  the  matrix      ‖   ‖  of  aggregate  transaction  flows,  find  the  quasi-permutation 
submatrix      (and  the  corresponding  permutation  matrix    )  associated  with  the  complete 
feedback loop with maximal flow intensity (  ). This loops stands on the top of the hierarchy. 

  Step 2: Replace in   the flows from    by arbitrary large negative numbers. For this new matrix 
    find  the  quasi-permutation  submatrix      (and  the  corresponding  permutation  matrix    ) 
associated  with  the  complete  feedback  loop  with  maximal  flow  intensity  (  ).  Since  the  flows 
from the top feedback loop have been replaced by arbitrary large negative numbers in   , they will 
not be included in this hierarchically subsequent loop. 

  Step 3 through r-1: repeat step 2 for the matrix   . 
After  r-1  steps,  one  obtains  a  sequence  of  r  complete  feedback  loops,  ordered  according  to  the 
decreasing  size  of  their  flow  intensities.  For  this  paper,  a  Matlab  program  was  compiled  to  find  the 
hierarchical sequence of r complete feedback loops at regional scale. 
 
3. Results 
 

In order to understand the spatial configuration of global production processes, first we look at the 
individual national / state level,  focusing on where each region sources the intermediate inputs  required 
for  its  final  production.  This  works  as  an  indication  of  each  region’s  dependency  on  the  international 
supply networks. Next, we take the global perspective and apply the feedback loop methodology for our 
inter-country  input-output  table  for  hierarchically  identifying  the  myriad  of  economic  interaction  in  the 
GVCs. 
 
3.1. Supply chain interdependency 
 

Table 1 presents, for selected countries in our model, the foreign value added shares in total final 
output  of  their  set  of  value  chains.  The  countries  of  origin  of  supply  chain’s  value  added  flows  are 
grouped into five blocks: Brazil (i.e. Brazilian states), NAFTA, EU27, East Asia, and “Others and RoW” 
comprehending the rest of the global economy. In this way, we intend assess each country’s dependency 
on the sourcing of intermediates from abroad, distinguishing their geographical origin. 

Of  all  blocks,  the  degree  of  fragmentation  within  the  NAFTA  block  is  the  lowest.  On  average, 
only 2.3% of its final production’s total output corresponds to value added from other NAFTA members. 
This  result  is  due  the  USA’s  self-sufficiency  in  intermediates  and  particularly  its  value  chains’  little 
reliance  on  other  NAFTA  countries.  Also  due  to  USA’s  self-sufficiency,  of  all  blocks,  NAFTA  is  the 
least integrated block with the rest of the world. The largest foreign value added share is sourced by the 
block  “Others  and  RoW”,  which  includes  important  energy  and  food  producers  in  the  world  (e.g.  the 
Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries).  For  both  Mexican  and  Canadian  value  chains, 

9 

 
fragmentation within the block is more important, i.e. their dependency on USA’s intermediates is larger 
than the other way around.  

Within the EU27, we find much tighter production sharing relationships. In this block, the average 
value chain has 8.1% of its total output corresponding to value added produced by other EU27 members. 
The reliance on intermediates sourced within the block is especially important for the Eastern European 
countries. Alongside Ireland and the Benelux countries, the largest shares of foreign value added sourced 
within the block correspond to the newer EU27 members’ set of value chains, especially Hungary, Slovak 
Republic,  Czech  Republic,  Slovenia,  Bulgaria,  and  Estonia.  Thus,  as  Los  et  al  (2014),  we  observe  that 
many  value  chains  in  the  EU27  are  predominantly  fragmented  within  the  block.  For  17  of  the  EU27 
countries,  the  share  of  foreign  value  added  sourced  within  the  block  was  larger  than  the  share  from 
elsewhere  in  the  world.  However,  it  is  very  important  that  most  of  the  exceptions  are  major  EU27 
countries,  which  value  chains  are  significantly  globalized,  relying  more  strongly  on  upstream  activities 
outside EU27. Still concerning the Eastern European countries, Table 1 shows that the contribution of the 
block “Others and RoW” for the final production is especially relevant for these countries. This is because 
of  their  expressive  production  sharing  with  Russia  (especially  in  Bulgaria  and  Lithuania),  and  in  lesser 
extent with Turkey (especially in Bulgaria and Romania). In fact, the interdependency seems to work both 
ways  with  Turkey,  as  sourcing  of  intermediates  from  EU27  as  a  whole  is  relatively  significant  for  this 
country’s value chains.  In the case of Russia, it is largely  self-sufficient in intermediates, so the foreign 
content in its value chains is quite small. However, Russia’s largest foreign value added share is in fact 
produced in EU27. 

As for East Asia, the production sharing within the block is more expressive than NAFTA’s, but 
quite timid compared to EU27’s. Value chains in Japan are especially self-sufficient in intermediates, so 
that only 1.5% of its total output correspond to value added from elsewhere in East Asia. The  relatively 
small East Asia share in the foreign value added of Chinese final production also seems to be at odds with 
the  suggestion  of  a  highly  integrated  production  network  with  other  countries  in  the  block  providing 
intermediates for further processing in China. As indicated by Los et al (2014), the small East Asia share 
does  not  contradicts  this  suggestion,  but  reflects  that  the  highly  integrated  Asian  production  system 
pertains to a relatively small part of final output in China (e.g. production of electronics). At global level 
and considering the absolute values, the interdependency among East Asia countries is quite important, as 
we will observe in the next subsection. Value chains in both Korea and Taiwan rely more  (than those in 
Japan  and  China)  on  upstream  activities  East  Asia.  They  are  also  important  for  the  value  chains  of 
Australia, Indonesia, and India, included in the block “Others and RoW”. Of the other blocks specified in 
Table 1, East Asia is the main source of foreign value added for final production in these three countries.

From Table 1, we observe that Brazil as a whole is mostly self-sufficient in intermediates. Of the 
countries in our model, the foreign content in the set of Brazil’s value chains is larger only than USA’s 
and Russia’s. However, there is a great degree of fragmentation among Brazilian states. For the average 
value chain, 15.3% of its final output’s value are added in a state other than where it has its completion. 
This is larger than the share observed for EU27, indicating even tighter production sharing relationships. 
Focusing the supply chain network within Brazil, Table 2 presents the regional value added shares in each 
state’s final production. In order to emphasize the spatial characteristics of the value chains, the Brazilian 
states are grouped into five regions.

In  the  Brazilian  supply  network,  the  dependency  of  all  states’  value  chains  in  relation  to 
Southeast’s  intermediates  is  outstanding.  For  every  state,  the  largest  value  added  share  in  their  final 
production  correspond  to  the  Southeast  region.  São  Paulo’s  upstream  activities  are  especially  important 
on average for final production anywhere in the country; their value added correspond to at least 4% (in 
Maranhão)  and  as  much  as  12%  (in  Amazonas)  of  final  output  in  the  other  states.  To  a  lesser  extent, 
intermediates from the South region also have significant contribution to all regions’ value chains. 

11 

 

Therefore,  we  observe  that  for  Brazilian  value  chains  the  fragmentation  within  the  regions  is 
considerably less relevant for final production than production sharing with the more developed Southeast 
and  South  regions.  Besides  Southeast  and  South  regions,  interdependency  within  the  region  is  more 
relevant for states in the Northeast; however, this is very much outshined by the supply networks across 
Brazilian regions. 

Table  2  also  presents  the  foreign  value  added  shares  in  the  states’  value  chains.  Alongside 
Amazonas and Paraná, São Paulo is the state which value chains are more integrated with the rest of the 
world; almost 10% of their final output consisted of value added in foreign countries (note, however, that 
it is  quite limited compared to  other countries in  our model).  Intermediates from  the block  “Others and 
RoW” are the most important for São Paulo’s final production, being followed by those sourced by EU27. 
Concerning the origin of foreign value added, Amazonas is distinguished as its final production absorbs 
intermediates  from  East  Asia  almost  as  much  as  from  the  block  “Others  and  RoW”.  This  is  due  the 
assembling of electronics in the Free Trade Zone of Manaus, which incorporates large amounts of parts 
from East Asia. 
 
3.2. Aggregate feedback loops 
 

In the previous subsection, we have analyzed, for each region in our model, the reliance of their 
final production on intermediates produced elsewhere in the world. Now, we take the global perspective 
and  identify  the  paths  in  global  supply  chains  in  terms  of  the  order  of  their  economic  importance,  by 
means of the hierarchical feedback loop approach. 

At  the  first  level  of  analysis,  all  the  supply  chain’s  value  added  flows  are  aggregated  into  one 
industry  to  reveal  the  macro-level  structure  of  feedback  loops.  Table  3  summarizes  the  hierarchy  of 
complete feedback loops, which are ordered according to the decreasing size of their flow intensities. In 
our analysis, we will focus on the top ten feedback loops, which together represented 94.6% of the global 
supply chains’ value added flows in 2008. 

Inspection of the aggregate supply chain’s value added flows shows that by far the largest are the 
domestic  flows.  Thus,  Step  1  of  the  hierarchical  procedure  produces  a  diagonal  quasi-permutation 
submatrix    .  Associated  with  this  set  of  flows  is  a  corresponding  permutation  matrix          and  the 
permutation  p1,  indicated  in  Table  3,  which  corresponds  to  the  domestic  flows  within  each  state  or 
country. The flow intensity of this complete feedback loop is equal  to    = 50,856,717 million US$ and 
accounts  for  84.9%  of  total  supply  chain’s  value  added  flows.  The  remaining  percentage  of  the  total 
flows, 15.1%, are the inter-regional flows. 

Next, we consider the direction and magnitude of the complete inter-regional feedback loops. Step 
2 of the hierarchical procedure results in the quasi-permutation submatrix   . The flow intensity of this 
complete  feedback  loop  is  equal  to        =  1,180,642  million  US$  and  accounts  for  13.1%  of  total  inter-
regional supply chain’s value added flows. Associated with these flows is a permutation matrix    which 
corresponds to the permutation p2, as in Table 3.  

It  is  broken  down  into  17  independent  closed  subloops.  The  dominant  subloop,  i.e.  the  subloop 
with  largest  flow  intensity,  (USA  RoW)  corresponds  to  the  pair-wise  exchange  between  the  USA  and 
RoW.  It  accounts  for  62.4%  of  the  flow  intensity  that  is  represented  in  the  complete  loop.  The  second 
most  important  (in  intensity  terms)  subloop  (CHN  KOR  IDN  IND  TWN  AUS JPN)  corresponds  to  the 
Oceania  and  Asia’s  countries  in  our  model.  The  supply  chain’s  value  added  flows  go  from  China,  to 
Korea, to Indonesia, to India, to Taiwan, to Australia, to Japan, and back to China. The flow intensity of 
this subloop is 15.7% of   . The third most important subloop (DEU FRA ITA ESP PRT LUX IRL GBR) 
includes the central economies in EU27, comprising the flows starting in Germany and going via France, 
Italy, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, Ireland and Great Britain going back to Germany. Its flow intensity 
represents 12.0% of   . The other subloops also have a clear geographical definition: Eurasian countries 
in (RUS TUR); the North American countries other than the USA in (MEX CAN); the South and East of 
EU27 in (AUT HUN ROM BGR GRC CYP SVN MLT EST FIN POL CZE SVK); the Benelux countries 
other than Luxembourg in (BEL NLD); the Nordic countries other than Finland in (DNK SWE); and the 
Baltic countries other than Estonia in (LTU LVA).

The remaining of the supply chain’s value added flows in the second feedback loop corresponds to 
eight closed subloops within Brazil. The dominant subloop within Brazil (MG RJ SP) corresponds to the 
most  developed  states  in  the  Southeast  region,  including  the  flows  going  from  Minas  Gerais,  to  Rio  de 

13 

 
Janeiro, to São Paulo and back to Minas Gerais. Its flow intensity is 2.1% of   . Excepting the subloop 
(AM PA ES BA PE PB  CE RN RO), which comprises states from  the North, Northeast,  and Southeast 
regions, each of the six other subloops includes states from exclusively one Brazilian region. 

Figure  3  presents  the  second  complete  feedback  loop  graphically.6  The  spatial  nature  of  the  top 
rank inter-regional feedback loop is readily apparent. The supply chain network described by this loop is 
geographically  concentrated  within  blocks  of  countries.  However,  we  must  remember  that  dominant 
subloop, which accounts for 62.4% of the flow intensity in  the loop,  corresponds  to  production sharing 
relationships  across  blocks  (between  the  USA  and  the  composite  region  RoW).  In  order  to  evaluate 
correctly the importance of fragmentation within blocks in opposition of global fragmentation, we must 
analyze the subsequent complete feedback loops, as we do in the following. 

As for Brazil, the top rank inter-regional feedback loop singles out supply chain networks within 
great regions. However, the apparent importance of fragmentation within each Brazilian region should be 
considered having in mind the adopted hierarchical procedure. In each step, it searches for the complete 
feedback loop with maximal flow intensity, with the constraint that each region is allowed precisely one 
transaction flow entering it and one flow leaving it. Thus, the presence of  the Southeast  states’ subloop 
precludes others states to display flows with this great region in the same loop. Given this, the procedure 
then  points  out  the  South  region’s  subloop  as  part  of  the  complete  feedback  loop  with  maximal  flow 
intensity. With the preclusion of flows entering in (and leaving from) both Southeast and South regions, 
then for the other states the maximal flow intensity is found in within-great regions flows.

Step  3  of  the  hierarchical  procedure  gives  the  next  complete  feedback  loop.  All  the  flows 
identified  in  the  first  two  steps  are  now  eliminated  from  further  consideration.  The  resulting  quasi-
permutation  submatrix     has  flow  intensity      =  1,088,000  million  US$  (12.1%  of  total  inter-regional

supply chain’s value added flows). From the permutation matrix   , we identify the permutation indicated 
in Table 3.  

Figure  4  present  the  third  complete  feedback  loop  graphically.  This  complete  feedback  loop  is 
divided into twenty  closed subloops. The dominant  subloop is  now (CHN RoW), which corresponds to 
the  pair-wise  exchange  between  China  and  RoW.  It  accounts  for  55.1%  of  the  flow  intensity    .  Also 
important  in  intensity  terms,  there  is  the  subloop  (USA  CAN)  of  cross-border  exchanges  between  the 
USA  and  Canada,  corresponding  to  21.4%  of    .  Accounting  for  13.3%  of    ,  we  identify  the  subloop 
(BEL GBR NLD DEU ITA FRA ESP), which comprises central economies in EU27, including the flows 
from Belgium to Great Britain, to the Netherlands, to Germany, to Italy, to France, to Spain and back to 
Belgium. As in the previous step, the EU27 countries are connected among themselves in this loop. The 
exceptions  are:  Romania  in  the  (ROM  TUR)  of  pair-wise  exchange  with  Turkey;  Poland,  which  is 
connected to Russia in (RUS POL); Denmark and Ireland, which are in the more complex subloop (MEX 
DNK IRL TWN IDN JPN KOR), which also includes countries from America and Asia, and Malta in the 
subloop (AP MLT RR) with states from the North region of Brazil.  

The result of Malta being connected to states from the North region of Brazil at a major feedback 
loop  should not be interpreted as an indication of strong economic linkage;  instead, we need to  have in 
mind  the  adopted  hierarchical  procedure.  In  each  step,  the  solution  determines  a  series  of  transactions 
with  maximal  flow  intensity  such  that  each  region  is  allowed  precisely  one  transaction  flow  entering  it 
and one leaving it. For small economies such as Malta and these states, a likely result is that their main 
partners are already connected to third regions at major feedback loops, so they end up being connected to 
other small economies. 
 
As for the Brazilian states, also in this third feedback loop they join closed subloops comprising 
exclusively  domestic  flows  (with  the  exception  of  Malta).  The  states  in  the  Southeast  region  again 
compose  the  dominant  subloop  within  Brazil  (MG  SP  RJ),  now  corresponding  to  flows  starting  from 
Minas Gerais and going via São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro back to Minas Gerais. The flow intensity of this 
subloop corresponds to 1.9% of   . We still observe a closed subloop comprising the states in the South 
region, but for the other regions in the country the transaction flows become more spatially spread out.

Proceeding  with  the  hierarchical  procedure,  in  the  step  4  we  obtain  the  quasi-permutation 
submatrix    with  flow intensity     = 832,397 million US$  (9.2% of total inter-regional  supply chain’s 
value added flows). Associated with these flows is a permutation matrix   , representing the permutation 
presented in Table 3. 

Figure  5  present  the  fourth  complete  feedback  loop  graphically.  It  is  composed  by  eleven 
independent  closed  subloops.  Differently  from  the  previous  loops,  here  the  dominant  subloop  does  not 
correspond  to  exchanges  between  two  regions,  but  to  a  sequence  of  transactions  centered  on  RoW  and 
involving  countries  from  Asia,  Europe,  Oceania,  and  America.  In  this  subloop  (RUS  DEU  RoW  JPN 
TWN  MEX  IDN  AUS  KOR),  the  supply  chain’s  value  added  flows  go  from  Russia,  to  Germany,  to 
RoW, to Japan, to Taiwan, to Mexico, to Indonesia, to Australia, to Korea, and back to Russia. The flow 
intensity of this subloop is 52.7% of   . The second most important (in intensity terms) subloop is (CHN 
USA) corresponding to the pair-wise exchange between China and the USA. It accounts for 31.4% of the 
flow intensity that is represented in the complete loop. Also important, we find a subloop of transactions 
connecting older and newer members of EU 27 (plus Turkey). This subloop (AUT CZE POL SWE NLD 
GBR IRL PRT ESP ITA GRC TUR BGR ROM SVN SVK HUN) accounts for 9.0% of   . 

The Brazilian states continue to be connected among themselves in this loop (excepting Roraima 
and  Amapá,  connected  to  Malta  in  (AC  RR  MLT  AP)).  The  dominant  subloop  within  the  country  (TO 
MA MT SC RJ PR SP RS MG GO MS AL PI) comprises states from all Brazilian regions and is centered 
on São Paulo,  which is connected to  states from the South  region.  The flow intensity of this subloop is 
2.6% of   .

Note: the red cell indicates the largest flow in the loop; orange cells, the dominant subloop. 

 

In each of the fifth to the tenth complete feedback loops, the largest flow involves the composite 
region RoW (incoming flows from Japan and from Great Britain in the fifth and sixth loop, respectively; 
outgoing flows directed to India, Germany, France, and Great Britain from the seventh to the tenth loop, 
respectively).

The  fifth  complete  feedback  loop  still  presents  a  supply  chain  network  that  is  geographically 
concentrated within blocks of countries: it includes the flow intensive subloops  (USA MEX) and (DEU 
GBR  ESP  FRA),  besides  the  chain  of  value  added  flows  going  from  Korea,  China,  and  Japan  in  the 
dominant subloop. From the sixth  loop,  we do not  observe such a clear spatial  pattern for supply  chain 
networks.  Although  these  loops  still  present  many  links  between  countries  within  EU27,  the  major 
economies  in  the  block  also  connect  to  outside-block  countries  (e.g.  Germany  is  linked  to  China  in  the 
sixth  and  seventh  loops;  Great  Britain  connects  with  the  USA  in  the  seventh  and  eighth  loops;  France 
links with the USA appear in the ninth and tenth loops). 

As  for  the  Brazilian  states,  with  exception  of  minor  flows  involving  small  EU27  countries,  they 
continue being linked exclusively among themselves in these loops. In fact, it is only in the 13th feedback 
loop  that  an  expressive  supply  chain  flow  takes  place  between  a  Brazilian  state  and  a  foreign  country 
(with  flows  of  value  added  from  Espírito  Santo  to  Indonesia’s  vaue  chains).  Within  Brazil,  we  observe 
that the subloops increasingly spread out geographically, depicting supply networks across great regions. 
In each of the loops, the dominant subloop is centered on São Paulo.  

Having this in view, Table 4 presents the pairwise São Paulo’s supply chain interactions, sorted in 
decreasing order of the bilateral flow’s intensity. The fact that the hierarchy of feedback loops reflects the 
rank-size  of  São  Paulo’s  links  with  other  Brazilian  states  is  an  evidence  of  the  polarizing  role  of  São 
Paulo for production fragmentation within Brazil.

On  the  other  hand,  we  observe  this  does  not  hold  for  São  Paulo’s  foreign  supply  chain 
interactions.  The  pairwise  interaction  with  the  composite  region  RoW,  which  bilateral  flow  intensity  is 
smaller only than the intra-regional’s for São Paulo, is depicted only in the 21th and 28th feedback loops 
(value added flows going from São Paulo to RoW’s value chains, and the other way around, respectively). 
This shows that even though the production sharing with foreign countries is important for the state itself, 
at global level its supply chain flows are relatively small. 

In  summary,  the  top  ten  feedback  loops  reveal  a  spatial  structure  for  the  global  supply  chains 
networks where the flows linking major economies across trade blocks are dominant. It is only secondary 
to  this  structure  that  supply  chains  are  well  defined  within  trade  blocks.  Together  with  the  results  for 
supply  chain  interdependency  for  individual  countries,  obtained  in  subsection  3.1,  we  observe  that 
production fragmentation is truly global, and not merely circumscribed to trade blocks.  

Therefore,  our  finding  stands  with  the  results  of  Los  et  al  (2014)  and  seem  to  be  at  odds  with 
Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez (2014), as well as with Johnson and Noguera (2012). We find no evidence 
for  the  statement  of  Baldwin  and  Lopez-Gonzalez  (p.  37,  2014)  that  “international  supply  chains  are 
mostly regional. Most supply-chain trade happens within have been called Factory Asia, Factory Europe 
and Factory America”. In fact, of the supply chain’s international value added flows, less than one forth 
takes  place  within  those  blocks  (4%,  16%,  and  4%  of  the  world  total,  respectively  within  East  Asia, 
EU27, and NAFTA). 

What  may  explain the divergence in  the studies’  conclusions? As indicated by  Los  et  al (2014), 
even though the findings of  Baldwin  and  Lopez-Gonzalez (2014) are  also  based on WIOD, there is  the 
crucial difference that they focus on an analysis of trade in intermediates rather than in value added, as we 
and  Los  et  al  (2014)  do.  There  is  a  large  literature  on  how  gross  trade  analysis  suffers  from  double-
counting  problems  (e.g.  Koopman  et  al,  2014),  as  the  gross  value  of  products  in  downstream  stages  of 
production also include the value added from upstream activities. For the analysis of the spatial structure 
of value chains it is crucial that if trading within a trade block is more in downstream intermediates than 
outside the block, within-block trade will be overestimated (in comparison with outside-block trade). We 
indicate  this  also  affects  the  findings  of  Johnson  and  Noguera  (2012)  for  the  VAX  ratio.  With  an 
overestimated denominator, logically the VAX  ratio among partners within blocks will be undervalued; 
interpreting this indicator may then lead to an overstatement of production sharing within trade blocks. 

As  for  the  spatial  structure  of  supply  chains  networks  within  Brazil,  the  main  feature  is  the 
dominance of the Southeast region’s states, especially São Paulo. That is, not only these states have major 
weight as suppliers of intermediates to other regions’ value chains, as seen in subsection 3.1, but also in 
absolute terms they have central roles for the Brazilian value chains. Fragmentation within great regions 
is a major phenomenon for the Southeast and (secondary to the links with São Paulo) the South regions. 
For  states  elsewhere  in  the  country,  supply  chain  connections  with  the  more  developed  states  in  Brazil 
overshadows production sharing with neighboring states. Focusing in supply chain interdependency and 
applying  the  hierarchical  feedback  loop  methodology,  our  findings  concerning  the  spatial  structure  of 
Brazilian  states’  interdependency  are  in  line  with  other  studies  for  the  inter-regional  linkages  in  the 
country, such as Perobelli et al (2006).7 
 
4. Concluding remarks 
 

The fragmentation  of production processes has induced  great  changes in  the spatial  location and 
organization of economic activity. In this paper, our objective was analyzing the geographical structure of 
GVCs’  flows  as  in  2008  by  means  of  the  hierarchical  feedback  loop  methodology.  In  contrast  to  other 
studies  that  employed  this  methodology  previously,  we  considered  the  regional  interdependencies  as 
depicted  in  a  country-state  input-output  table  comprising  the  global  productive  system.  Our  application 
also  differs  as  we  take  into  account  value-added  flows  involved  in  the  supply  chains,  rather  than  inter-
regional gross trade.

applying the extraction method by Dietzenbacher et al, 2003.

At  global  level,  our  analysis  primarily  reveals  a  spatial  structure  for  the  global  supply  chains 
networks where the flows linking major economies across trade blocks are dominant.  In fact, more than 
75% of supply chain’s international value-added flows link countries in different trade blocks. It is only 
secondary  to  this  structure  that  supply  chains  are  well  defined  within  blocks.  On  average,  within-block 
production fragmentation is more intense for countries in EU27 than in NAFTA or East Asia. In EU27, 
the average value chain has 8.1% its total output corresponding to value added produced by other country 
members.  In  NAFTA  and  East  Asia,  only  2.3%  and  3.3%  respectively  of  their  final  output  correspond 
within-block  foreign  value  added.  Thus,  our  results  indicate  that  production  fragmentation  is  a  truly 
global phenomenon, not being merely circumscribed to trade blocks. 

For  Brazil  as  a  whole,  we  observed  that  the  country’s  value  chains  are  mostly  self-sufficient  in 
intermediates. Moreover, even for the states where production sharing with foreign countries is relevant, 
such as Amazonas, Paraná, and São Paulo, at global level its supply chain flows are relatively small. On 
the  other  hand,  there  is  a  great  degree  of  fragmentation  among  Brazilian  states.  In  the  average  value 
chain,  15.3%  of  final  output  corresponds  to  value-added  from  a  state  other  than  where  it  has  its 
completion. This  is  larger than the share observed for EU27,  indicating  even tighter production sharing 
relationships in the Brazilian production networks.  

When it comes to the spatial structure of supply chains networks within Brazil, the main feature is 
the  dominance  of  the  Southeast  region’s  states,  especially  São  Paulo.  Not  only  these  states  have  major 
weight as suppliers of intermediates to other regions’ value chains, but also in absolute terms (as indicated 
by  the  feedback  loop  analysis)  they  have  central  roles  for  the  Brazilian  value  chains.  Fragmentation 
within great regions is a major phenomenon for the Southeast and (secondary to the links with São Paulo) 
the South regions. For states elsewhere in the country, supply chain connections with the more developed 
states in Brazil overshadows production sharing with neighboring states.  

Because  of  space  limitations,  the  results  of  the  application  of  the  feedback  loop  approach  at 
sectorial  level  have  been  omitted.  Yet,  they  contribute  by  evidencing  the  nature  of  the  inter-regional 
dependencies.  For  São  Paulo’s  value  chains,  for  example,  we  observed  that  the  state’s  final  production 
mainly  promotes  agricultural  activities  in  the  South  region.  With  the  other  main  state  partners,  supply 
chain trade seems primarily based on comparative advantages mostly from mineral natural endowments, 
alongside deliberate policies directed to manufacturing poles elsewhere in the country. 

Our results concern the production systems as in the year 2008. At global level, we may wonder 
what were financial crisis’ effects on the fragmentation of value chains. The aforementioned study of Los 
et  al  (2014),  with  basis  on  the  WIOD  tables  for  2009  to  2011,  indicates  that  the  steady  increases  in 
international fragmentation continued until the onset of the crisis in 2008. The crisis induced a major dip 
on  the  participation  of  foreign  value  added  in  final  product  outputs  in  2009,  but  this  appeared  to  be  a 
short-run effect for virtually all chains.  Concerning the crisis’ effects on the geography of value chains, 
the authors observe that it seems to have propelled the trend toward truly global fragmentation. Contrary 
to regional fragmentation, global fragmentation of value chains picked up immediately after the crisis and 
had  reached  the  precrisis  level  again  in  2011.  In  this  movement,  China  appears  to  have  played  an 
important role in the global relocation of activities.  

Regarding  the  spatial  organization  of  value  chains  within  Brazil,  it  seems  unlikely  that  major 
changes  took  place  since  2008.  According  to  the  Regional  Accounts  (IBGE,  2014),  between  2008  and 
2012 the Southeast and the South region lost participation in the national value added to the other regions, 
especially the Central-West. However, this relocation involved only 1% of the country’s value added. In 
fact,  the  geography  of  production  within  Brazil  remains  quite  similar  over  the  years.  For  example, 
Perobelli  et  al  (2006)  evaluated  the  interregional  linkages  based  on  an  input-output  table  for  the  year 
1996, and obtained results close to ours indicating the dominance of São Paulo in the Brazilian productive 
structure, and the low level of interdependency of the states within the North, Northeast and Central-West 
regions. These results should be observed in the designing of regional development policies. For example, 
our results indicate that the installation of a manufacturing plant in a state from the Northeast region, on 
average,  will  not  impact  value  adding  activities  of  its  neighboring  states  as  much  as  will  impact  the 
developed Southeast region.

In the case policies intend to alter the configuration of regional interdependencies, its generating 
factors must be evaluated, which was not our focus in this paper. However, from what was observed for 
the global fragmentation process it seems that the lowering costs of service links activities, which brought 
out profound changes in the spatial structure of economic activities worldwide, may also lead to  spatial 
reorganization  within  Brazil  (with  limitations,  of  course,  as  many  activities  cannot  be  relocated  at 
regional level). In this regard, investments in transportation infrastructure, acting as shortener of distances 
across regions (HADDAD, 2004), deserve special attention in development policies.
