Abstract 
The objective of this work is to test empirically the relationship between exchange rate and 
the structural change for the Latin American countries over the period 1975-2017. For this 
purpose, it is employed four variables to represent the structural change; the sectoral share of 
GDP  of  industry,  services  and  primary  sectors,  the  economic  complexity  index,  and  the 
growth of industrial share of employment. Two different specifications are performed. The 
empirical findings of first specification suggest that a devalued (overvalued) exchange rate 
promotes the industrialization (a structural change towards services) and the sophistication 
of productive structure. Yet, the results of the second specification point that an overvalued 
exchange  rate  promotes  the  deindustrialization,  but  a  devalued  exchange  rate  does  not 
necessarily  promote  the  industrialization.  Therefore,  in  Kaldorian  terms,  an  overvalued 
exchange  rate  hurts  the  long-run  growth  of  Latin  American  economies,  but  a  devalued 
exchange rate does not necessary boosts the long-run growth via the indirect effects in the 
structural change towards industry.

Resumo 
O objetivo deste trabalho é testar empiricamente a relação entre a taxa de câmbio e mudança 
estrutural para os países da América Latina no período entre 1975 e 2017. Para tanto, quatro 
variáveis foram utilizadas para mensurar o processo de mudança estrutural: a parcela do PIB 
da  indústria,  serviços  e  setores  primários,  o  índice  de  complexidade  econômica  e  o 
crescimento  da  parcela  industrial  do  emprego  em  duas  diferentes  especificações.  Os 
resultados  da  primeira  especificação  indicam  que  uma  taxa  de  câmbio  desvalorizada 
(valorizada) promove um processo de industrialização (mudança estrutural em direção aos 
setores  de  serviço)  e  a  sofisticação  da  estrutura  produtiva.  No  entanto,  os  resultados  da 
segunda especificação sugerem que uma taxa de câmbio valorizada contribui para o processo 
de  desindustrialização,  ao  passo  que  uma  taxa  de  câmbio  desvalorizada  não  gera 
necessariamente um processo de industrialização. Deste modo, em termos kaldorianos, uma 
taxa  de  câmbio  valorizada  reduz  o  crescimento  de  longo  prazo,  mas  uma  taxa  de  câmbio 
desvalorizada não impulsiona necessariamente o crescimento de longo prazo via os efeitos 
indiretos na mudança estrutural.

Introduction 

1. 
 
Structural change is an engine of growth within the heterodox economics. In so far as the 
manufacturing sectors are characterized by the higher ability to generate innovative activities 
than  other  sectors,  the  increasing  returns  to  scale  and  the  backward/forward  linkages, 
growing manufacturing sectors boost the productivity and the long-run growth. There exist 
some stylized facts according which manufacturing sectors play a central role in promoting 
the productivity and the long-run growth widely known as the Kaldor’s laws. Specifically, 
the  manufacturing  sectors  play  a  special  role  in  promoting  the  long-run  growth  for  the 
developing countries as its productivity growth depends on the access to the technology of 
developed  countries  and  the  promotion  of  structural  change  towards  modern  sectors 
(Ocampo and Vos, 2008). 

The exchange rate policy comes up as a tool for development of developing countries 
as far as it makes the access to northern innovative activities possible by means of changes 
in  the profitability of tradable sectors and its effects  in  the capital  accumulation. Also,  an 
exchange  rate  policy  orientated  towards  the  development  allows  for  the  structural  change 
(Gabriel  and  Missio,  2018)  and  industrial  diversification  (Rodrik,  2006)  as  it  protects  the 
infant industries and promotes the capital accumulation of tradable sectors.  

This  paper  aims  at  testing  empirically  the  relationship  between  exchange  rate 
movements and structural change for Latin American countries over the period 1975-2017.3 
For this, it is employed various variables to represent its structural change; the sectoral share 
of GDP in terms of industry, primary sectors and services, the economic complexity index 
and  the  industrial  share  of  employment.  Controlling  other  variables,  it  is  performed  two 
alternative  specifications  in  a  panel  setting  considering  the  measure  of  exchange  rate 
misalignment calculated by Couhard (2017). The first specification introduces the exchange 
rate misalignment variable directly in order to test the effects of exchange rate movements in 
the  structural  composition.  The  second  specification  splits  up  the  exchange  rate 
overvaluations from the devaluation movements with a view to test the effects of exchange 
rate movements in the structural composition separately. Both estimates are tested employing 
short-panels using five-year averaged database and long-panels using yearly database.  

The  results  of  the  first  specification  showed  that  devaluations  (overvaluations)  of 
exchange rate are associated to structural changes towards the industry (services) in terms of 
GDP share and employment and to a productive structure (less) more sophisticated. In turn, 
the results of second specification displayed that exchange rate overvaluations are associated 
to the deindustrialization process in terms share of GDP and employment, but exchange rate 
devaluation  are  not  an  enough  policy  to  promote  the  industrialization  of  Latin  American 
economies.  

This paper has four sections besides this short introduction. Second section discusses 
the relationship between structural change and long-run growth. Third section presents the 
arguments  in  literature  according  which  the  exchange  rate  affects  the  structural  change.

Structural change and long-run growth: the structuralist perspective 

The  relationship  between  sectoral  composition  of  economy  and  long-run  growth  is 
controversial within the economics. A strand of literature states that structural change stems 
from growth. The economic growth is accompanied by changes in sectoral composition of 
output so that structural change is a consequence instead of growth’s cause.4 In this view, the 
expansion  of  economy  and  markets  reconfigures  the  structural  composition  of  economies 
from primary sectors to secondaries and, then, to tertiary sectors in terms of contributions to 
output, employment and investment (Ocampo  et  al, 2009). In developed economies (or in 
high-income economies) the industrial sectors play a timid role in terms of contribution to 
GDP  to  detriment  of  service  sectors.  Meanwhile,  the  poorest  economies  are  essentially 
dominated  by  primary  sectors  with  serious  constrains  to  access  modern  technology  and 
unable to provide increasing returns to scale (Ocampo et al, 2009). According to this view 
structural change does not matter or simply has a passive role. 

Other strands of economics see the structural change as the engine of long-run growth. 
Within the structuralist perspective, the long-run growth is a dynamic process characterized 
by  a  continuing  transformation  of  the  productive  structures  based  upon  the  creative 
destruction  in  the  Shumpeterian  sense  (Ocampo,  2005).  Or,  within  classical  development 
economics  a  la  Lewis  (1954),  higher  long-run  growth  rates  may  be  achieved  through  the 
reallocation  of  labor  from  low-  (non-industrial  sectors)  to  higher-productivity  activities 
(industrial sectors).  

From  this  angle,  the  key  point  is  the  sectoral  specificities  with  respect  to  ability  to 
generate innovative activities, to boost the productivity growth and to integrate the domestic 
sectors. The industrial sectors play a central role in the promotion of long-run growth because 
of its higher productivity growth to extent that they are more dynamic in terms of innovative 
activities and have increasing returns to scale (Ocampo et al, 2009). Besides, manufacturing 
sectors  have  a  larger  potential  to  induce  the  domestic  integration  via  the  backward  and 
forward linkages with other sectors of the economy a la Hirschman (1958) in a manner that 
the manufacturing growth exerts a pulling effect in the economy (Tregenna, 2008).  

Szirmai  (2012)  offers  a  summary  on  the  theoretical  arguments  in  favor  of 
industrialization as the main engine of long-run growth. First, manufacturing sectors require 
more  capital  accumulation  than  other  sectors.  Second,  manufacturing  sectors  present 
economies of scale and encompass more embodied and disembodied technological progress. 
Third, manufacturing sectors have more backward and forwards linkages than other sectors. 
Those arguments suggest that manufacturing is more productive than other sectors so that a 
structural change towards manufacturing sectors boosts the long-run growth (Szimai, 2012). 
Su and Yao (2016) showed empirically that, in the case of middle-income economies, the 
manufacturing  sectors  are  associated  to  higher  savings,  faster  pace  of  technological 
accumulation and stronger contributions of human capital and institutions to growth. 

In this line, the manufacturing sectors play a crucial role to explain the differences of 
long-run  growth  between  countries  within  the  Kaldorian  growth  theory.  The  first  law  of 
Kaldor states that faster growth in industry lead to faster growth of the economy. The ability

to promote the structural change to industry is associated to success or failure concerning the 
long-run  growth.  Developed  countries  are  those  that  promoted  the  industrialization  of  its 
productive  structure,  whereas  the  developing  countries  are  those  trapped  in  a  primary 
productive structure.  

The  Kaldorian  growth  theory,  anchored  in  the  circular  cumulative  causation  a  la 
Myrdal  (1957),  puts  the  presence  of  increasing  returns  to  scale  at  the  center  of  growth 
explanation (Ros, 2015). Following Ros (2015), the growth of aggregated labor productivity 
   and  non-industrial  productivity 
p  is  a  weighted  sum  of  industrial  productivity  growth  pind
growth pnind: 

𝑝 = 𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑑 + 𝑏𝑝𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑑                                                     (1) 
The second law of  Kaldor, in  turn, states that manufacturing productivity  growth  pind is  a 
positive function of industrial production growth qind in a manner that: 

 𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑑 = 𝛼0 + 𝑣𝑞𝑖𝑛𝑑                                                       (2) 
where the constant α0 is the autonomous rate of capital accumulation per worker, and v is the 
Verdoorn’s coefficient – or the pace of capital accumulation induced by demand growth and 
the  pace  of  technical  progress  incorporated  in  capital  accumulation  (Dixon  and  Thirlwall, 
1975). As the growth rate of industrial labor productivity is the difference between the growth 
rate of output qind and industrial employees eind, equation (2) may be re-written as: 

𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑑                                                    (3) 
The  Verdoorn’s  coefficient  is  supposed  to  be  less  than  one  in  order  to  exist  a  positive 
relationship  between  industrial  employment  growth  and  industrial  productivity  growth 
(increasing returns to scale) (Ros, 2015).  

𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑑 =

In  contrast, as  the non-industrial  sectors  are unable to  generate  increasing returns to 
scale, its productivity growth 𝑝𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑑 is determined residually as the difference between output 
growth 𝑞𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑑 and employment  growth 𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑑 (Ros, 2015). It is  assumed that there exists a 
linkage  between  non-industrial  and  industrial  sectors,  so  that  the  output  growth  of  non-
industrial sectors is a function of industrial output growth: 

 𝑞𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑑 = 𝑐0 + 𝑐1𝑞𝑖𝑛𝑑                                                      (4) 
The non-industrial employment growth is defined as the difference between the labor supply 
growth n and industrial employment growth 𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑑: 

𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑑 = 𝑛 − 𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑑                                                           (5) 

Representing the employment growth e as the following identity: 

𝑒 = 𝜓𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑑 + 𝜓𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑑                                              (6) 
where  𝜓𝑖𝑛𝑑  and  𝜓𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑑  are  respectively  the  share  of  industrial  and  the  non-industrial 
employment in the overall employment. Assuming that 𝑛 equals 𝑒, and introducing (6) into 
(5): 

𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑑                                           (5.1) 
Ros (2015)’s formalization leads to following determination of productivity growth of

Equation  (1.1)  represents  the  third  Kaldor’s  law  and  states  that  the  productivity  of  the

of  Kaldor)  and  via  the  classical  development’s  mechanism  represented  by  the  structural 
change promoted by the reallocation of employment from non-industrial to industrial sectors 
inasmuch  as  the  industrial  production  is  positively  associated  with  industrial  employment 
(Ros,  2015).  Besides,  the  industrial  expansion  increases  the  non-industrial  productivity 
indirectly via the linkage’s effect (Ros, 2015). In another words, equation (1.1) shows that 
the  long-run  performance  represented  by  overall  labor  productivity  growth  depends 
positively  (negatively)  on  industrial  production  and  on  structural  change  towards 
manufacturing (population growth) (Ros, 2013).  

Yet,  structural  change  is  a  broader  process  than  the  growth  of  industry  and  modern 
services, it is about the ability to create new activities and to integrate the domestic sectors 
(Ocampo  and  Vos,  2008).  In  a  hand,  recent  literature  moved  forward  incorporating  other 
aspects  of  structural  change  besides  the  industrial  share  of  employment.  Tregenna  (2008) 
highlights  the  importance  of  understanding  the  structural  change  not  only  in  terms  of  the 
share of industrial employment, but also in terms of share of industry in GDP as far as the 
Kaldorian processes operate via employment and output. Hidalgo et al (2007), in turn, put 
into  the  picture  a  discussion  on  structural  change  and  economic  performance  in  terms  of 
economic  complexity.  Growing  economies  sophisticate  its  products  and  exports  towards 
goods that require infrastructure, institutions, and human and physical capital (Hidalgo et al, 
2007).  The  economic  complexity  is  associated  to  useful  knowledge  embedded  in  its 
productive structure in a manner that higher the complexity of economy, faster the growth 
(Hausmann, Hidalgo et al 2011).  

In  another,  the  Kaldorian  literature  moved  on  discussing  other  aspects  associated  to 
Verdoorn’s mechanism. Setterfield (1995) argues that the returns to scale are obtained under 
a specific technological state-of-the-art, human capital and institutions which creates a lock-
in  point.  Growing  economies  under  an  obsolete  technological  paradigm  generate 
endogenously the conditions for a lock-in point in a period with lower increasing returns to 
scale and labor-productivity (Setterfield, 1995). Setterfield and Cornwall (2003) endogenized 
the  parameters  α0  and  v  of  second  law  of  Kaldor  with  respect  to  institutional  regime 
connecting  historical  elements  and  institutional  differences  to  economic  performance  in 
Kaldor (1970) model. In a similar fashion, Ocampo (2005) endogenized the parameters α0 
and v regarding the technological capabilities, the degree of innovativeness, the incentives 
and institutions of economies.  

Naastepad  (2005),  Hein  and  Tarassow  (2010)  and  Hartwing  (2013)  associated  the 
Verdoorn’s mechanism to the effects of income distribution into demand growth a la Baduhri 
and Marglin (1990). Those authors concluded that income distribution has different effects 
on  productivity  growth  via  Verdoorn’s  mechanism  depending  on  the  demand  regime  of 
economy (wage- or profit-led). Romero and Britto (2017), in turn, combined the Kaldorian 
and  the  Schumpeterian  traditions  associating  the  research  intensity  and  knowledge 
accumulation  with  the  size  of  Verdoorn’s  coefficient.  Iasco-Pereira  and  Romero  (2017) 
associated  the  size  of  Verdoorn’s  coefficient  to  colonial  institutions  for  the  Brazilian 
municipalities case.  In a nutshell, the recent literature within Kaldorian literature supports 
the  vision  according  which  the  Verdoorn’s  mechanism  is  more  complex  than  simply 
increasing demand growth as far as the increasing returns to scale are associated to supply-
side elements. 

In sum, in the structuralist perspective the structural composition of economy matters 
for the long-run growth. The structural change, as a broader process in which demand growth 
and  elements  of  supply  side  are  interwoven,  is  the  engine  of  long-run  growth  instead  of 

5 

 

consequence. Policies that promote the structural change toward modern sectors (in terms of 
industrial share of employment/GDP or economic complexity) are the key for the long-run 
growth. Next section discusses briefly the literature on the profitability/development channel 
through which an exchange rate policy for development affects the labor productivity growth.   

 

3.  Why does the exchange rate matter for long-run growth?  
 

There exists a vast  empirical  literature that documented the effects  of exchange rate 
movements  on  economic  growth.  The  bulk  of  this  literature  states  that  exchange  rate 
undervaluation  boosts  the  growth  whilst  overvaluation  hurts  it  (Razin  and  Collins,  1997, 
Easterly,  2001,  Acemoglu  et  al,  2003,  Hausmann,  Pritchett  and  Rodrik,  2005,  Vieira  and 
MacDonald,  2012,  Glüzmann,  Levy-Yeyati  and  Sturzenegger,  2012,  among  others).  In  a 
hand, part of this literature confirmed that this relationship is especially valid for developing 
countries  (Gala,  2008,  Rodrik,  2008,  Rapetti,  Skott,  and  Razmi,  2011).  In  another,  some 
authors (Ros and Skott, 1998, Frenkel and Ros, 2006, Rodrik, 2008, Ros, 2013) indicate that 
the  transmission  channel  from  exchange  rate  movements  to  growth  is  the  profitability  of 
tradable  sectors  in  which  the  production  has  increasing  returns  to  scale  (manufacturing 
sectors). Such transmission channel is the profitability-development channel (Ros, 2013). 

Ros  and  Skott  (1998)  modelled  the  effects  of  trade  liberalization/exchange  rate 
overvaluation in a theoretical model with two assumptions: a sluggish wage adjustment and 
increasing returns to scale in tradable sectors. They concluded that the first assumption means 
that  trade  liberalization  leads  to  an  overvaluation  of  domestic  currency  whilst  the  second 
assumption creates the possibility of multiple equilibria. The existence of multiple equilibria 
points that overvaluations (devaluations) have contractionary (expansionary) effects in long-
run growth due to reduction (expansion) of capital accumulation (Ros and Skott, 1998).   

Frenkel and Ros (2006) examined the role played by the exchange rate in determining 
employment  performance  and  its  channel’s  transmissions.  They  pointed  the  existence  of 
three channels.  The  macroeconomic  channel suggests that higher competitiveness sparked 
by devaluations leads to higher exports, demand, output and employment even with the co-
existence of contractionary effects caused by falls in real wage (Frenkel and Ros, 2006). The 
labor intensity channel adds a further variable in determining the effects of devaluation in 
unemployment;  the  negative  effects  on  labor  costs  of  tradable  sectors.  This  channel  is 
associated  to  the  effects  of  exchange  rate  movements  in  the  structural  composition  of 
economies via changes in its relative prices. In a hand, devaluations boost the profitability of 
tradable sectors and encourage the more intensive labor use. In another, overvaluations cut 
off the profitability but encourage firms to increase its competitiveness via reducing the labor 
use  (Frenkel  and  Ros,  2006).  The  development  channel  associates  the  devaluations  to  the 
export  promotion  industrialization  as  the  exchange  rate  establishes  the  relative  prices  of 
tradable and non-tradable goods and acts as a uniform tariff (subside) on imports (exports). 
A competitive exchange rate then rises the profitability of tradable sector and encourages its 
production, employment and investment, promoting a structural change towards those sectors 
(Frenkel and Ros, 2006). 

In a similar fashion, Rodrik (2008) argues that devaluations boost the profitability of 
tradable sectors, especially the manufacturing sectors, increasing its importance in productive 
structure. Rodrik (2008) offers two explanations for the causal link between exchange rate 
devaluation, profitability of tradable sectors and growth. The first explanation is the idea that 
bad institutions of low-income countries act as a higher tax on tradable sectors, resulting in 

6 

 

a misallocation of resources in terms of investment. Accordingly, by increasing profitability, 
exchange  rate  devaluations  increase  investment  and  efficiency.  The  second  explanation  is 
that one according which undervaluation acts as a substitute for industrial policy to remediate 
the market failures of tradable sectors. Rodrik (2008) argues that, insofar as the economic 
development is a process of structural change towards a productive structure more diversified 
and  complex  and  that  market  failures  are  more  severe  in  new  lines  of  production, 
devaluations of exchange rate induce the production of new products and entails higher long-
run growth.  

Although  the  literature  supports  the  view  according  which  exchange  rate  affects 
directly  long-run  growth,  some  authors  indicate  the  existence  of  an  indirect  effect  via 
structural change. The exchange rate is connected to the profitability of tradable sectors and 
to  its  investment  and  employment  decisions.  As  devaluations  (overvaluations)  distort  the 
relative  prices  in  favor  of  tradable  (non-tradable)  sectors  and  decrease  (increase)  the  real 
wage,  the  higher  (lower)  profitability  enhances  (lowers)  its  production  and  investment 
promoting the reallocation of resources towards tradable (non-tradable) sectors. Therefore, 
as  the  tradable  (non-tradable)  sectors  encompass  the  manufacturing  sectors  (services), 
devaluations (overvaluations) of exchange rate boost (hamper) the long-run growth directly 
and indirectly via its effects on profitability and then on structural composition of economy.  
Next section discusses the empirical strategy and the database employed in estimates.  

 
Empirical strategy  

4. 
 

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  there  are  few  works  that  assessed  empirically  the 

relationship between the exchange rate and structural change performance.  

Vaz and Baer (2013) documented the effects of exchange rate movements on the output 
growth  of  industrial  sectors  for  39  countries,  including  Latin  America,  in  a  panel  setting. 
They  concluded  that  exchange  rate  devaluations  may  be  part  of  a  growth  strategy  in 
promoting the growth of industrial output and that its effects are stronger in Latin American 
economies.  

Gabriel  and  Missio  (2018)  assessed  the  effects  of  exchange  rate  movements  on 
industry,  primary  and  services  sectors  in  terms  of  its  values  added  in  GDP  and  on  the 
economic complexity index for 118 countries in a panel setting. Their results pointed that an 
undervalued exchange rate affects positively the industrial sectors specially in in developing 
countries.  In  addition,  their results  also  showed that  an undervalued exchange rate  affects 
positively  (negatively)  the  primary  sectors  of  developed  (developing)  countries,  but,  in 
another hand, the exchange rate was not significant in the regressions estimated to explain 
the  services  sectors.  Lastly,  a  devalued  exchange  rate  was  positively  associated  with 
economic complexity.  

The empirical strategy of this paper consists of estimating two different specifications 
in a panel data setting using a five-years average database and a yearly database. The database 
comprises 14 countries5 and covers the period 1975-2017 or 9 five-years periods from 1975-
1979 to 2015-2017. The structural change (dependent variable) is represented by three sets 
of  variables:  (1)  the  GDP  share  of  industry,  primary  and  services  sectors  provided  by  the 
World Bank, (2) the economic complexity index calculated by the observatory of economic

complexity, and (3) the growth rate of industrial employment share from GGDC 10-sector 
database.  The  movements  of  exchange  rate  are  represented  by  the  exchange  rate 
misalignment  𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡  calculated  by  Couharde  et  al  (2017).  This  measure  of  exchange 
misalignment  is  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  indeed  exchange  rate  and  the 
equilibrium  exchange  rate.6  Negative  values  are  associated  with  undervaluation  episodes 
whilst positive values with overvaluation episodes.  

The two specifications are presented as follow: 

 
𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠 + 𝑓𝑖 + 𝑓𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡                                    (8) 
 
𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 =  𝛼 + 𝛽𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠 + 𝑓𝑖 + 𝑓𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡       (9) 

 

where i and t represent country and time dimensions, respectively. Both specifications are 
performed with a constant 𝛼 and a full set of countries and time dummies (𝑓𝑖 and 𝑓𝑡). The 
first specification employs the exchange misalignment 𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡 as an explanatory variable in 
estimates.  A  negative  (positive)  signal  of  𝛽  means  that  devaluations  are  positively 
(negatively) associated to structural change whilst overvaluations are negatively (positively) 
associated to structural change.  

The  second  specification  splits  the  exchange  misalignment  𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡  into  two  new 
variables; 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑡 that results from the multiplying 𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡 by a dummy variable that represents 
the overvaluation episodes (1 for positive values of 𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡, zero otherwise) and 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑡 which 
results  from  the  multiplying  𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡  by  a  dummy  variable  that  represents  the  devaluation 
episodes (1 for negative values of 𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡, zero otherwise). The aim of second specification is 
to test the effects of devaluation and overvaluation episodes in structural change separately. 
Moreover,  the  regressions  control  other  variables.  The  profit-share  of  GDP  is 
introduced in the right side of estimates in order to capture the effects of profitability channel 
on the measures of structural change. This variable is calculated by subtracting the values of 
wage-share calculated by Tosoni (2017) from one hundred.  

Following  the  structuralist  perspective,  the  terms  of  trade  are  controlled  in  the 
regressions. The idea is that the international trade between southern and northern economies 
is distinguished by a deterioration of the terms of trade according to which there is an upward 
trend of manufacturing prices and a downward trend of agricultural prices (Prebisch-Singer 
hypothesis) (Di Filippo, 2009). Insofar as the structural change towards modern sectors of 
southern  economies  depends  on  the  imports  of  capital  and  technologies  from  northern 
economies,  the  deterioration  of  the  terms  of  trade  entails  lack  of  international  reserves  to 
carry over a structural change process (Cimoli and Porcile, 2011).  

Further  variables  are  introduced  to  control  the  possible  effects  of  trade  openness, 
government  consumption,  inflation  rate  and  the  level  of  income.  Table  1  describes  and 
presents the sources and the basic statistics of all variables used in estimates.

6 Couharde et al (2017) considered three variables as the fundamentals of the real effective exchange 
rate  to  calculate  the  equilibrium  exchange  rate:  the  income  per  capita  (Balassa-Samuelson  effect),  the  net 
foreign asset position and the terms of trade.

The  regressions  were  performed  employing  the  current  and  the  lagged  values  of 
exchange rate variables. All controlling variables were employed in lagged values (except 
for the terms of trade and the inflation rate). The first set of regressions was performed using 
the 5-years average of database in level. In turn, the second set of regressions was performed 
using the yearly database and the econometric method of Panel Corrected Standard Errors 
(PCSE)  to  handle  with  the  residual  correlation  (over  time  and  across  panels).  It  should 
highlight that all variables were employed in first difference to assure its stationarity (except 
the exchange rate misalignment measure).7 Next section presents the empirical findings.

Empirical findings 

The  estimates  of  first  and  second  specifications  are  presented  in  this  section.  The 
estimates  employing  the  5-years  average  database  are  estimated  with  robust  errors  to 
heteroskedasticity.  In  turn,  the  estimates  employing  the  yearly  database  are  estimated 
considering robust errors to heteroskedasticity, and the residual correlation are modelled as 
an AR (1) process for each panel.  

 

5.1. 

Estimates with 5-years average database 
 

Table  2  presents  the  estimates  of  first  specification.  The  parameter  of  𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡  is 
statistically significant in all regressions except when the GDP share of primary sectors is the 
dependent  variable. Yet, the signal  of 𝛽 differs across the  different  measures of structural 
change. In terms of GDP share, the parameter of 𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡 is negative for industry and positive 
for services, meanwhile it is negative for the complexity index and industrial employment. 
In a hand, these results suggest that exchange rate devaluations are associated with increasing 
(decreasing) share of industry (services) of GDP, as well as with increases of industrial share 
of employment and with a more sophisticated productive structure in terms of complexity. 
In another, they also suggest that exchange rate overvaluations are associated with increasing 
(decreasing) GDP share of services (industry), with falls of industrial share of employment 
and with a less sophisticated productive structure. The parameter 𝛽 of 𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡−1 is statically 
significant and negative in the regressions employing the complexity index as the dependent 
variable.  
 

[TABLE 2 AROUND HERE] 

 

Table  3  presents  the  results  of  second  specification.  The  parameter  𝛽𝑑𝑒𝑣  is  not 
statistically  significant  in  all  regressions  performed.  However,  the  parameter  𝛽𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟  is 
statistically  significant  at  1%  critical  values  and  negative  in  the  regressions  performed  to 
explain  the  industrial  share  of  GDP  and  the  growth  of  industrial  share  of  employment. 
Interestingly, the results of second specification suggest that exchange rate devaluations are 
not an enough condition to promote the structural change towards industry. Nonetheless, they 
suggest that exchange rate overvaluations have deleterious effects on the industrial share in 
terms of GDP and employment.  

                                                           

7 The panel unit root tests Levin-Lin-Chu, Hadri LM, Harris-Tzavalis, (to balanced variables), and Im-
Pesaran-Shin and Fisher (to unbalanced variables) pointed that all variables of yearly database are I(1), except 
the exchange rate misalignment which is I(0).

[TABLE 3 AROUND HERE] 

 

The  controlling  variables  of  first  and  second  specifications  tell  the  same  story.  The 
parameters  of  profit-share  of  GDP,  trade  openness  and  inflation  rate  are  not  statistically 
significant at 5% or 1% critical values in all regressions. The parameter of terms of trade is 
statistically significant and negative in all regressions, except in the case of the sectoral share 
of services in GDP and the growth of industrial employment share. Such result means that 
improvements in terms of trade are negatively associated with the performance of industrial 
and primary sectors in terms of GDP share and with the sophistication of structure productive. 
The  parameter  of  the  government  consumption  variable  is  significant  and  positive  in  the 
regressions of GDP share of services and complexity index. The parameter of income level, 
in  turn,  is  statistically  significant  only  in  the  regressions  performed  considering  the  GDP 
share of industry and primary sectors as the dependent variable with, respectively, negative 
and  positive  signals.  Therefore,  higher  the  income-level,  lower  (higher)  the  industrial 
(primary) share of GDP. 

The  results  of  estimates  of  first  specification  using  the  5-years  average  database 
suggested  that  an  undervalued  exchange  rate  promotes  the  structural  change  of  Latin 
American economies to industry in terms of industrial share of GDP and employment and 
economic complexity. It also suggested that an overvalued exchange rate favors the service 
sectors. In another hand, the effectiveness of a policy for structural change to industry based 
on a devalued exchange rate was not corroborated by the results of second specification. That 
is,  its  results  suggested  that  episodes  of  a  devalued  exchange  rate  are  not  statistically 
significant for any variable of structural change. Yet, episodes of overvalued exchange rate 
are statistically significant with a negative parameter for the industrial share of GDP and the 
growth of industrial share of employment. This way, those results suggest that an overvalued 
exchange  rate  promotes  the  deindustrialization,  but  a  devalued  exchange  rate  does  not 
promote the industrialization or the sophistication of productive structure.  

Estimates with yearly database 

 
5.2- 
 
Table 4 presents the results of first specification employing the yearly database. The 
parameter of 𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡 is statistically significant in all regressions except when the GDP share of 
primary  sectors  and  the  complexity  index  are  the  dependent  variable.  The  signal  of  𝛽  is 
negative in the regressions performed to explain the GDP share of industry and the growth 
of industrial share of employment. Meanwhile, the signal of 𝛽 is positive in the regressions 
performed to explain the GDP share of services. As previously obtained, those results suggest 
that exchange rate devaluations are associated with increasing (decreasing) share of industry 
(services) in GDP and with positive variations of industrial share of employment. Plus, it also 
suggests that exchange rate overvaluations are associated with increasing (decreasing) share 
of services (industry) in GDP and with decreasing growth of industrial share of employment. 
The parameter 𝛽 of 𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡−1 is statistically significant and negative only in the regressions of 
growth of industrial share of employment.

Table 5 presents the results of second specification employing the yearly database. As 
previously  obtained,  the  parameter  𝛽𝑑𝑒𝑣  is  not  statistically  significant  in  all  regressions 
performed.  However,  the  parameter  𝛽𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟  is  statistically  significant  and  negative  in  the 
regressions performed to explain the industrial  share of GDP and the  growth of  industrial 
share of employment anew. Once more these results suggest that exchange rate devaluations 
do not promote the industrialization by itself, but that exchange rate overvaluations promotes 
the  deindustrialization  in  terms  of  GDP  and  employment  share.  The  parameter  𝛽𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟  of 
𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑡−1 is statistically significant and negative only in the regressions performed to explain 
the growth of industrial share of employment.  
 

[TABLE 5 AROUND HERE] 

 

Regarding  the  controlling  variables  of  first  and  second  estimates,  the  regressions 
displayed that the parameter of profit-share of GDP is statistically significant and positive 
only  for  the  industrial  share  of  GDP.  The  parameter  of  terms  of  trade  is  statistically 
significant and negative in the regressions performed to explain the GDP share of industry 
and the complexity index. The variable trade openness is statistically significant for the GDP 
share  of  primary  and  services  sectors  and  the  complexity  index.  However,  its  signal  is 
positive for the GDP share of primary sectors and for the complexity index, and negative for 
the  GDP  share  of  services  sectors.  The  parameter  of  government  consumption  is  not 
significant in all regression. The inflation rate is significant for industrial and primary sectors 
in terms of GDP share and its signal is, respectively, positive and negative. 

The results of first specification using the yearly database are attuned to the empirical 
findings of section 5.1. They showed that an undervalued exchange rate is associated to the 
promotion  of  structural  change  to  industry  in  terms  of  industrial  share  of  GDP  and 
employment  and  the  reduction  of  services  sectors.  In  turn,  an  overvalued  exchange  rate 
increases  the  importance  of  services  in  GDP  rather  than  industry  in  terms  of  GDP  and 
employment. The foregoing results of second specification are also corroborated. Episodes 
of overvalued exchange are associated to deindustrialization meanwhile episodes of devalued 
exchange rate are not  associated to  industrialization. On the other hand,  estimates of both 
specifications employing the yearly database suggested that the profitability channel is valid 
to explain the industrial performance in terms of GDP share.  Then, policies that boost the 
profit-share of GDP seems to be associated to the industrialization in terms of GDP share.  

 

Final Remarks 
 

In the kaldorian-structuralist perspective, the structural change towards industry is the 
engine of long-run growth. The manufacturing sectors have special properties, such as higher 
ability  to  generate  innovative  activities,  increasing  returns  to  scale  and  backward/forward 
linkages,  so  that  its  added  value  and  employment  contribute  more  to  growth  than  other 
sectors. The policies of promotion of structural change are the key for the long-run growth.  
In this respect, the exchange rate become essential in the promotion of industrialization 
or  sophistication  of  productive  structure.  Even  though  the  literature  supports  the  view 
according which exchange rate affects directly the long-run growth, recently some authors 
point the existence of an indirect channel via its effects in the structural change. The argument 
is  that  exchange  rate  is  connected  to  the  profitability  of  tradable  sectors  and,  then,  to  its 
investment and employment decisions. The positive effects of exchange rate devaluations in 

11 

 

the  profitability  take  place  through  the  distortions  of  relative  prices  in  favor  of  tradable 
sectors and by reducing the real wage. A devalued exchange rate promotes the reallocation 
of resources towards tradable sectors by increasing its profitability and, then, its production 
and investment. Into the extent that tradable sectors encompass the manufacturing sectors, 
devaluations of exchange rate boost the long-run growth directly and indirectly via its effects 
on profitability and then on structural change toward manufacturing sectors. 

This paper performed econometric regressions following two different specifications 
and using two databases, a five-years averaged and a yearly. Controlling for other variables, 
the  empirical  findings  of  first  specification  suggest  that  an  undervalued  (overvalued) 
exchange  rate  affects  positively  (negatively)  the  industry  in  terms  of  share  of  GDP  and 
employment. It also suggested that an overvalued (devalued) exchange rate affects positively 
(negatively)  the  services  in  terms  of  GDP  share.  Therefore,  in  the  kaldorian-structuralist 
outlook,  the  exchange  rate  devaluations  boost  the  long-run  growth  of  Latin  American 
economies  by  promoting  an  industrialization  process.  On  the  other  hand,  the  empirical 
findings of first specification point that an overvalued exchange rate hampers the long-run 
growth of Latin American economies due its positive effects in the services to the detriment 
of its negative effects in the industry. Furthermore, the results of first specification displayed 
that  exchange  rate  devaluations  raise  the  economic  sophistication  of  Latin  American 
economies (only the regressions employing the five-years averaged database). 

However, the effectiveness of a policy for structural change towards the industry based 
on a devalued exchange rate has been put in doubt by the the empirical findings of second 
specification.  The  episodes  of  a  devalued  exchange  rate  are  not  statistically  significant  to 
explain any variable of structural change. However, the episodes of overvalued exchange rate 
are statistically significant with a negative parameter to explain the industrial share of GDP 
and the growth of industrial share of employment. Thus, the results of second specification 
point  that  an  overvalued  exchange  rate  promotes  the  deindustrialization,  but  a  devalued 
exchange  rate  does  not  promote  the  industrialization  or  the  sophistication  of  productive 
structure. Or, in another words, an overvalued exchange rate hampers the long-run growth of 
Latin American economies, but a devalued exchange rate does not necessary boosts the long-
run growth via the indirect effects in the structural change towards industry.
