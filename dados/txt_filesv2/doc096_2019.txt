The Dutt Model revisited: Uneven Development and the Balance of Payments Constrained Model. A 

debate on Terms of Trade, Economic Cycles, and Productivity Catching-up. 

Danilo Spinola* 

Abstract 

This  paper  expands  the  Dutt  (2002)  version  of  the  Balance  of  Payments  Constrained  Model  (BPCM) 
questioning the price-neutrality assumption, in which terms of trade and real exchange rate grows at zero rate in 
the long-run, do not affect the equilibrium economic growth. This research offers a Post-Keynesian/Structuralist 
alternative in which BPCM results hold without the price-neutrality assumption, becoming compatible with the 
Prebish-Singer hypothesis, with the presence of a long-term decline in terms of trade. The research focuses on 
three  main  elements:  (1)  the  long-run  behavior  of  the  terms  of  trade  in  a  Structuralist  framework.  (2)  the 
cyclical  endogenous  dynamics  in  the  relationship  between  economic  activity  and  income  distribution  à  la 
Goodwin.  (3)  Productivity  gap  and  catching-up.  Dutt  (2002)  presents  a  north-south  model  that  explicitly 
develops the transition between short- and long-run in the Thirlwall system. We modify the model by (a) adding 
a productivity gap dynamics in which the south has a catching-up element, (b) Model the labor market of the 
southern  economy  by  including  a  Phillips  Curve  for  the  relationship  between  employment  rate  and  economic 
activity, (c) Add a labor supply dynamics that considers the Lewisian labor transfer problem between traditional 
and modern sectors. The inclusion of these elements changes the main structure of the model, resulting in a 4-
dimensional  dynamic  system  that  captures  uneven  development  and  cyclical  convergence  patterns  in  the 
trajectory between short- and long-run. We find that the structuralist/evolutionary arguments hold in the BPCM 
framework even when the Thirlwall law is questioned. For the BPCM theorists, accepting price non-neutrality 
mean a return to the neoclassical world in which prices adjust the model to the equilibrium. We challenge this 
statement and offer a Structuralist alternative to question the price neutrality assumption, turning the Thirlwall’s 
BPCM more compatible with the classical Latin American Structuralist tradition.

1.  Introduction 

Thirlwall’s framework, aka the Balance of Payments Constrained Model (BPCM),  is one of the most relevant 
contributions  of  the  Post-Keynesian  school  of  thought  to  economic  theory  (Davidson,  1990;  Dutt,  2002).  It 
states  that  the  growth  rate  of  an  economic  system  must  be  compatible  with  the  constraints  imposed  by  the 
balance  of  payments.  Assuming  that  terms  of  trade  and  financial  flows  are  stable  in  the  long  run,  Thirlwall 
derives a rule in which the growth rate of an economy depends directly on the income elasticity ratio between 
exports and imports. This in the literature became known as the Thirlwall Law (Mccombie, 1989). 

There  is  a  large  literature  tradition  focused  on  estimating  the  parameter  of  the  Thirlwall  Law,  measuring  the 
income elasticity of imports and exports for different countries (Alonso & Garcimartín, 1998). These measures 
show that the Thirlwall law offers a very good proxy to explain long-run growth rates, especially in developed 
countries.  In  developing  economies,  however,  the  correlation  between  observed  growth  rates  and  the  ones 
predicted by the BPCM are not direct, as the short-term effects of terms of trade fluctuation and financial flows 
volatility systematically deviates the actual growth rates from the one predicted by the law (A. P. Thirlwall & 
Hussain, 1982).

Despite the strong relevance of the Thirlwall law in the development economics literature, the strict focus on the 
law  itself  neglects  some  important  aspects  of  the  BPCM  (Dutt,  2002)  such  as  uneven  development  and  the 
short-  to  long-run  transition  dynamics.  This  article  tackle  these  two  important  aspects  usually  ignored  in  the 
broad debate about the Thirlwall framework. 

A  central  assumption  of  the  Thirlwall  law  is  that  price  effects  are  stable  in  the  long-run.  This  assumption, 
however,  is  subject  to  many  critiques  (described  in  McCombie  (2012)).  It  contradicts  the  core  of  the 
Structuralist tradition, condensed in the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis, which defends the existence of a declining 
trend in the terms of trade for developing countries. This  trend is caused by a specialization of the productive 
structure in  products  with  smaller income  elasticity of demand (primary  commodities). As income  grows, the 
relative prices of primary commodities increase at a smaller rate than manufactured goods, resulting in a decline 
in the terms of trade. This reinforces the uneven development conditions between north and south.  

From  the  long-run  world  of  the  Thirlwall  Law  to  the  short-run  one  described  in  the  Thirlwall  framework  we 
discuss  the  transition  dynamics.  In  the  short-run  both  price  and  quantity  effects  serve  as  adjustment 
mechanisms:  price-  and  income-elasticity  of  imports  and  exports,  the  terms  of  trade  (real  exchange  rate),  and 
financial flows serve as  adjustment mechanisms. We study the transition between short- to  long-run from  the 
explicit imports and exports equations. We follow the Dutt (2002) model, that offers a possible solution to the 
transition  dynamics endogenizing the terms of trade  evolution  towards the long-run adjustment.  Dutt builds a 
model with a north-south dynamics in which the north follows a monopolistic Keynesian-Kaleckian framework 
while  the  south  is  modelled  in  perfect  competition  with  a  Marx-Lewis  (Lewis,  1954)  dynamics.  Despite 
critiques to this model related to the way south is modeled, we see it as an important contribution to start the 
discussion between uneven development and transition dynamics in the BPCM.  

Economic volatility is another important  element in economic development, a source of uneven development. 
Countries  with  bigger  GDP  oscillations,  usually  developing  countries,  face  higher  challenges  in  achieving  a 
stable  development  process.  Regular  patterns  of  oscillation  (cycles)  may  emerge  in  the  transitory  dynamics 
between short-run and long-run. A canonic contribution goes back to the Goodwin (1967) model, that discussed 
the emergence of endogenous cycles from the relationship between economic activity and income distribution. 
When  considering  the  BPCM,  the  volatility  sources  come  from  terms  of  trade  and  financial  flows,  which  are 
ignored in the Thirlwall law. This concept of volatility in the Thirlwall model is directly related to the concept 
of fragility, the resilience of an economic system to external shocks.  

The role of the productive structure is brought to the model by the Structuralist theory. In Prebisch (1950), the 
behavior  of  the  terms  of  trade  is  defined  by  the  productive  structure  of  a  country  in  the  context  of  an 
international  division  of  labor.  A  specialized  structure  with  smaller  labor  productivity  level  has  a  high 
productivity gap between laggard south and advanced north. This impacts in a decline in the terms of trade, as 
the  southern  economy  is  specialized  in  products  with  smaller  income  elasticity,  which  reduces  the  growth 
possibilities  of  the  south.  On  the  other  hand,  the  productivity  gap  may  follow  its  own  dynamics.  Laggard 
economies may have higher opportunities for learning, getting closer to the productivity levels of the north. So 
the Gap may create opportunities.  

The objective of this research is to observe the transition dynamics in the BPCM capturing economic cycles, the 
productivity  gap,  and  the  behavior  of  terms  of  trade.  We  initially  follow  the  baseline  model  defined  by  Dutt 
(2002) and expand it by: (a) adding a productivity gap dynamics in which the south has a catching-up element; 
(b)  model  the  labor  market  of  the  south  economy  by  including  a  Phillips  Curve  to  discuss  the  relationship 
between employment rate and economic activity; (3) add a labor supply dynamics that considers the  Lewisian 
problem  of  the  labor  transfer  between  traditional  and  modern  sectors  (Lewis,  1954).  The  inclusion  of  these 
elements changes the structure of the Dutt model, resulting in a 4-dimensional expanded dynamic system that is 
able  to  generate  interesting  patterns  in  the  trajectory  between  short-  and  long-run.  We  study  the  model  and 
present some scenarios to discuss the following research questions:  

2 

 

How  do  the  Price  dynamics  affect  the  results  of  the  BPCM  when  we  assume  price  non-neutrality?  How  can 
technology  efforts  and  structural  change  relate  to  the  Price  Effects?  Are  the  countries  away  from  the 
technological  frontier  more  fragile  and  volatile?  What  determines  the  magnitude  of  the  cycles?  Under  which 
conditions can we reach a virtuous development process in the context of non-neutrality of price effects? What 
are the effects on economic growth? 

After this introduction, in section 2 we develop a brief literature review discussing the BPCM. In section 3 we 
raise the research questions related to this research. In section 4 we show the development of the baseline model 
based on Dutt (2002). In section 5 we add the expansions to the model. In section 6 we discuss the properties of 
the expanded model. In section 7 we study the signs of the model to discuss stability and cycles. In section 8 we 
develop some scenarios and analyze the results in section 9. Finally, in section 10 we conclude this paper. 

2.  Literature review 

2.1.  Thirlwall’s Law and the Thirlwall Model 

The Thirlwall model (Thirlwall, 1979) is a growth model that links the economic growth possibilities with the 
constrains  imposed  by  the  balance  of  payments.  The  model  can  be  explicitly  derived  from  export  and  import 
functions. Using the variables defined in Dutt (2002) we have: 

 

𝑀 = 𝜃𝑀(1 𝑃⁄ )−𝜇𝑌𝜀 

𝛿 
𝑋 = 𝜃𝑋(𝑃)−𝜈𝑌𝑓

(1) 

(2) 

𝑀  and  𝑋  represent  total  imports  and  total  exports,  respectively.  𝜃𝑀  and  𝜃𝑋  are  constants.  𝑌  is  the  domestic 
income and 𝑌𝑓 the foreign income. The relative price 𝑃 represents the price ratio between domestic prices (𝑃𝑑) 
and foreign prices (𝑃𝑓), in domestic currency – multiplied by the real exchange rate (𝐸). 𝑃 = 𝑃𝑑 𝐸𝑃𝑓
. 𝜇 and 𝜈 
are  the  price  elasticities  of  imports  and  exports,  respectively.  Finally,  𝜀  and  𝛿  are  the  income  elasticity  of 
imports  and  exports.  Imports  increase  with  higher  domestic  income  while  exports  grow  with  higher  foreign 
income. Import falls with increases in the relative price while exports  rise. Price elasticities define the growth 
sensitivity to price changes and income elasticities the growth sensitivity to output/income changes. 

⁄

The variable 𝐹 represents the financial flows. The equilibrium of the balance-of-payments occurs when we have 
balance between net exports plus net financial flows and net imports: 

 

Writing eq.(3) in terms of growth rates we have: 

𝑃𝑋 + 𝐹 = 𝑀 

[1 − (𝐹 𝑀⁄ )][𝑃̂ + 𝑋̂] + (𝐹 𝑀⁄ )𝐹̂ = 𝑀̂ 

 

(3) 

(4) 

In which the hat above the letters implies growth rates. When we replace 𝑀, 𝑋 and 𝑃 by eq. (1), (2) and 3, we 
end up with the Thirlwall growth equation, which is given by:  

𝑌̂ = (1 𝜀⁄ ){(1 − 𝜇 − 𝜈)𝑃̂ + [1 − (𝐹 𝑀⁄ )]𝛿𝑌𝑓̂ + (𝐹 𝑋𝑁⁄

)[𝐹̂ − (1 − 𝜈)𝑃̂]} 

(5) 

 

In the long-run, Thirlwall considers that there is no change in the Terms of Trade (𝑃̂ = 0), and Capital Flows 
are constant (𝐹̂ = 0). These assumptions result in the  Thirlwall Law. Net capital flows are stable in the long 
run, and the growth rate will depend on the ratio between income elasticities of exports and income elasticity of 
imports, multiplied by the rate of growth of foreign GDP. 

𝑌̂ = (𝛿 𝜀⁄ ) 𝑌𝑓̂  

(6)

or 

(7) 
Income growth rate depends on the income elasticities, which is usually considered exogenous1.  

𝑌̂ = (1 𝜀⁄ ) 𝑋̂ 

The  usual  simplification  (𝑃̂ = 𝐹̂ = 0)  results  in  some  theoretical  and  empirical  problems.  (1)  As  pointed  by 
Dutt  (2002),  the  simplification  ignores  the  transitional  dynamics.  We  cannot  observe  the  trajectory  between 
short-  and  long-run,  which  neglects  some  possible  effects  in  the  adjustment  process  that  may  affect  the  final 
outcome (steady state). (2) There are also a high number of articles discussed in Blecker (2016) and McCombie 
(2012), that question the empirical validity of the Thirlwall law, especially for developing regions (effective rate 
diverging  from  the  income  elasticity  ratio).  (3)  The  BPCM  assumes  that  terms  of  trade  are  do  not  affect  the 
long-run, contradicting the decline in the terms of trade theory (𝑃̂ < 0).   

2.2.  Uneven Development and the Transitional Dynamics 

Dutt (2002) proposes to treat transition dynamics in an open north-south framework. In this model he focuses 
on uneven development, an important but usually neglected matter raised by Thirwall (2012). 

In  the  old  structuralism  (Prebisch,  1950),  the  position  of  an  economy  in  the  international  division  of  labor 
defines its development possibilities. A country specialized in the production and export of raw materials tends 
to progressively lag behind than those that produce and export manufactured goods. Products are heterogeneous 
in  terms  of  price  and  income  elasticity  of  demand.  Those  with  higher  income  elasticity  of  demands 
(manufactured  goods)  see  a  rise  in  their  demand  as  international  economy  grows,  resulting  in  higher  relative 
prices  than  raw  materials.  This  results  in  an  uneven  development  in  which  the  core  countries  of  the  system 
advance  in  their  productive  structure  while  the  periphery  remains  trapped.  According  to  the  old  structuralist 
ideas, the solution in this system is to increase government intervention towards the creation and development 
of modern manufacture high-productive sectors. 

The  Thirlwall  framework  does  not  focus  on  productive  heterogeneity  but  on  the  role  of  changes  in  terms  of 
trade  and  financial  flows.  The  growth  rate  considers  the  structural  aspects  of  the  economy  (captured  by  price 
and income elasticity of imports and exports). There is no inherent trend of decline of the terms of trade as in 
the old structuralist ideas, as price does not play a role in stablishing the growth possibilities. In the Thirlwall 
model  autonomous  demand2  is  endogenous  to  the  behavior  of  the  external  sector,  so  investments  are  then 
endogenous to the balance of payments possibilities. 

2.3.  Assumptions and Empirical validity of the Thirlwall Law. 

As observed in section 2.1, the Thirlwall model depends on two assumptions to keep its validity. That (I) terms 
of trade and (II) financial flows grow at zero-rate in the long-run. This can be condensed in what Blecker (2016) 
highlights as the main assumption in the Thirlwall model: price effects are neutral in the long-run. In order to 
have that, we must assume that either price-elasticity is too low (“Elasticity Pessimism”: 𝜇 + 𝜈 ≈ 1), or that the 
real exchange rate grows at zero rate in the long run (𝑃̂ = 0), and financial flows balance itself close to zero in 
the  long-run  (𝐹̂ = 0).  Accepting  these  three  assumptions  lead  to  economic  adjustments  to  the  equilibrium  in 
quantities  rather  than  prices.  As  price  effects  are  neutral,  the  domestic  growth  rate  adjust  the  system  to  the 
conditions  imposed  by  the  balance  of  payments  constrains.These  three  assumptions  have  been  passive  to 
critiques from BPCM researchers. Empirically we still have an open debate if actually price effects are neutral 
in the long-run. 

2.4.  The role of price effects and the incompatibility between Prebisch and Thirlwall 

                                                           
1 There are however articles focused on endogenizing the income elasticities in the structuralist theory, relating income elasticities to 
the behavior of the productive structure (Cimoli & Porcile, 2014; Porcile & Spinola, 2018).

In  the  new  structuralist  ideas  (Cimoli  &  Porcile,  2014),  theories  by  Raul  Prebisch  and  Anthony  Thirlwall  are 
usually  seen  as  complementary.  However,  there  is  a  very  important  element  that  is  usually  neglected  in  the 
discussion and that raises a big contradiction in the theory. In Prebisch-Singer hypothesis  there is a long-run 
tendency to a decline in the terms of trade (𝑃̂ < 0). When accepting the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis and the 
Marshall-Lerner  condition  holds  (price  elasticity  imports  is  bigger  than  1),  price  effects  are  not  neutral  in  the 
long-run, but declining in developing countries. This perspective contradicts the main assumption that results in 
the Thirlwall Law, that 𝑃̂ = 0.  

With the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis, adjustments to the equilibrium may not occur only in quantities, but also 
on  prices  (terms  of  trade),  defining  the  long-run  economic  growth  rate.  In  this  sense,  price  effects  impact  on 
long-run economic growth. 

3.  Research Question and methodology 

This research proposes to relate (1) the behavior of the terms of trade with (2) cyclical endogenous volatility, 
and  (3)  the  productive  sector  (productivity  gap).  It  consists  in  a  Thirlwall-Goodwin  model  with  elements  of 
technological catching-up. 

Why are we using the Dutt (2002)  model? The seminal Dutt  (2002) model offers a starting point to answer 
our  research  questions.  It  criticizes  the  Thirlwall  Law  offering  a  theoretical  proposal  inside  the  BPCM 
framework to  challenge  the idea that prices are neutral  in  the long-run. This  model allows us to  approach the 
Prebisch-Singer  hypothesis,  in  which  prices  decline  in  the  long-run,  while  observing  transition  dynamics  and 
uneven development. 

Why do we want to expand the model?  

Our goal is to link three central structural issues of developing economies: Balance of payments constrains, high 
growth volatility and a fragile productive structure. The original model restricts itself to the behavior of terms of 
trade, and how it evolves from capital accumulation. We add elements that deal with the matter of volatility in 
developing countries using the Goodwin cyclical dynamics, discussing its determinants and effects. Following a 
Structuralist  perspective,  we  associate  the  regular  volatility  (cycles)  to  the  fragile  structural  conditions  of  the 
south.  Productivity  gap,  which  is  associated  to  the  topics  of  structural  change  and  technological  dynamics, 
closes the model. 

Research Questions: 

RQ1: How do the Price dynamics affect the results of the BPCM when we assume  𝑃̂ endogenous and 𝑃̂ ≠ 0? 
What conditions the behavior of the Terms of Trade, how can we observe a Prebisch-Singer behavior (𝑃̂ < 0) ?  

RQ2: How can technology efforts and structural change relate to the Price Effects? What defines the conditions 
to  a  virtuous  catching-up  process?  Are  the  countries  away  from  the  technological  frontier  more  fragile  and 
volatile? 

RQ3:  Considering  the  effects  of  volatility  in  the  process  of  economic  development.  What  determines  the 
magnitude of the cycles? What are the impacts of a higher volatility? 

RQ4: Under which conditions can we reach a virtuous development process in the context of non-neutrality of 
price effects? What are the effects on economic growth?

4.  The baseline Dutt (2002) model 

A  basic  North-South  model  based  on  the  Thirlwall  law  states  that  the  relationship  between  growth  rates  in 
North and South depends on the ration between income elasticity of imports in the North and South.  

𝑌𝑆̂ 𝑌𝑁̂⁄ = 𝜀𝑁 𝜀𝑆⁄  

(8) 

 

Dutt (2002) discusses two economies that interact through their external sector: (i) a southern economy, marked 
by perfect competition with fixed real wage and unemployment labor (following a Marx-Lewis structure), and 
(ii)  a  northern  economy  that  has  imperfect  competition,  in  which  firms  practice  mark-up  pricing  and  excess 
capacity, with a Kalecki-Keynes structure. 

The monopolistic north has its price level defined by a markup function over costs, with price-making firms:  

 

𝑃𝑁 = (1 + 𝑧)𝑊𝑁𝑏𝑁 

(9) 

In which 𝑃𝑁 is the price level in the north; 𝑧 consists in the mark-up (𝑧 ≥ 1); 𝑊𝑁 is the wage level in the north 
and  𝑏𝑁  is  the  fixed  unit  labor  requirement  for  the  northern  good  (also  understood  as  the  inverse  of  labor 
productivity). An increase in markup and/or on costs (unitary wages) raises price levels, as well as a reduction 
in labor productivity (increases in productivity have a negative impact on prices).  

The south follows a perfect competition specification. Southern GDP (𝑌𝑆) operates at full capacity. It follows a 
fixed the relationship between capital stock in the south (𝐾𝑆) and the fixed capital-output ratio in the south (𝑎𝑆). 

 

Real wages in the south (𝑉𝑆) is defined as the ratio between nominal wages (𝑊𝑆) and price index in the south 
(𝑃𝑆): 

𝑌𝑆 = 𝐾𝑆 𝑎𝑆⁄  

(10) 

𝑉𝑆 = 𝑊𝑆 𝑃𝑆⁄  

(11) 

 

Consumers  in  the  north  consume  all  their  income,  while  capitalists  save  a  fraction  (𝑠𝑁)  of  their  income.  The 
north  spends  a  fraction  𝛼  of  their  consumption  expenditure  on  southern  goods  (and  the  rest  on  the  northern 
goods). This fraction is equal to: 

𝛼 = 𝛼0𝑌𝑁

𝜀𝑁−1𝑃1−𝜇𝑁 

(12) 

  
𝛼0  is  the  autonomous  part  of  the  northern  expenditure  in  southern  goods;  𝑌𝑁  is  the  GDP  in  the  north. 
Considering 𝐸 = 1, The terms of trade (𝑃) is given by the ratio between prices in the south (𝑃𝑆) and prices in 
the north (𝑃𝑁):  

𝑃 = 𝑃𝑆 𝑃𝑁⁄

 

(13) 

  
In  the  south,  workers  spend  all  their  income  on  southern  goods.  Southern  capitalists  save  a  fraction  (𝑠𝑆)  and 
consume  the  rest.  Part  of  the  consumption  (𝛽)  is  spent  on  the  northern  good.  Analogous  to 𝛼;  𝛽  can  be 
described as: 

𝛽 = 𝛽0(𝜎𝑆𝑌𝑆)𝜀𝑆−1(1 𝑃⁄ )1−𝜇𝑆 

(14) 

  
𝛽0 is the autonomous part of the southern expenditure in northern goods.  𝜎𝑆 is the profit share of southern total 
income. This profit share is the residual from the wage share (𝜔𝑆) on total output: 𝜔𝑆 = 𝑏𝑆𝑉𝑆. The profit share 
can be specified as the part of total income that does not go to wages: 

6 

 

  
In which 𝑏𝑆 is the labor-output ratio in the south (𝑏𝑆   = 𝐿𝑆 𝑌𝑆⁄ ). 

𝜎𝑆 = (1 − 𝑏𝑆𝑉𝑆) 

(15) 

The  investment  function  follows  a  Kaleckian  specification  based  on  Bhaduri  &  Marglin  (1990),  in  which 
capacity utilization affects the capitalists perception of economic activity. When capacity utilization increases, 
capitalists  perceive  it  as  an  increase  in  effective  demand,  which  stimulates  them  to  increase  total  capacity  by 
immobilizing capital in order to sustain the increases in the demand. Investments in the north are then given by: 

𝑔𝑛 = 𝐼𝑁 𝐾𝑁⁄

= 𝛾0 + 𝛾1(𝑢) 

(16) 

  
In which 𝐼𝑁 is total investment in the north, 𝛾0 and 𝛾1 are positive constants. 𝑢 consists on the rate of capacity 
utilization, which is given by 𝑢 = 𝑌𝑁 𝐾𝑁⁄
. The next step is to find explicit equations for northern and southern 
exports. Considering the equations for 𝑃𝑆 and 𝑋𝑆, the total value of southern exports is given by: 

𝑃𝑆𝑋𝑆 = 𝛼{[1 + (1 − 𝑠𝑁)𝑧]/(1 + 𝑧)}𝑃𝑁𝑌𝑁 

(17) 

  
Applying eq.(12) on eq.(17), we end up with the equation for southern exports, which can be given in its 
reduced form as: 

  
In which 𝜃𝑆 = 𝛼0[1 + (1 − 𝑠𝑁)𝑧]/(1 + 𝑧). 𝜃𝑆 is a constant. 

𝑋𝑆 = 𝜃𝑆𝑃−𝜇𝑁𝑌𝑁

𝜀𝑁 

(18) 

The northern total exports to the south are equal to the southern imports from the north, being the southern total 
imports 𝑀𝑆 = 𝛽𝜎𝑆𝑌𝑆 we have: 

  
Using eq.(14) on eq.(19), the equation for northern exports is given by: 

𝑃𝑁𝑋𝑁 = 𝛽𝜎𝑆𝑃𝑆𝑌𝑆 

  
In which we have the constant 𝜃𝑁 = 𝛽0𝜎𝑆

𝜀𝑆. 

𝑋𝑁 = 𝜃𝑁(1 𝑃⁄ )−𝜇𝑆𝑌𝑆

𝜀𝑆 

(19) 

(20) 

This simple static model highlights the properties of the north-south interaction. Southern and Northern exports 
are explicitly addressed in order to reach equilibrium in current account, balancing the values of exports in north 
and south. 

4.1.  Dynamics properties of the Thirlwall model 

The  dynamic  properties  of  the  Dutt  (2002)  model  are  derived  from  the  excess  demand  (𝐸𝐷)  functions  in  the 
north and south. In the south, excess demand (𝐸𝐷𝑆) is given by: 

𝐸𝐷𝑆 = 𝐶𝑆𝑆 + 𝐼𝑆𝑆 + 𝑋𝑆 − 𝑌𝑆 

 
And as 𝑀𝑆 = 𝐶𝑆𝑆 + 𝐼𝑆𝑆 − 𝑌𝑆 = and 𝑀𝑆 = (
 

1

𝑃

) 𝑋𝑁: 

𝐸𝐷𝑆 =   𝑋𝑆 − (

1
𝑃

) 𝑋𝑁 

  
While, analogously, excess demand in the north (𝐸𝐷𝑁) is given by: 

 

(21) 

 
(22) 
 

7 

  

𝐸𝐷𝑁 = 𝐶𝑁𝑁 + 𝐼𝑁 + 𝑋𝑁 − 𝑌𝑁 

𝐸𝐷𝑁 = 𝐼𝑁 − 𝑆𝑁 + 𝑋𝑁 − 𝑃𝑋𝑆 

Following a market clearing equilibrium, there is no excess demand in the long-run: 

  

𝐸𝐷𝑖 = 0 

(23) 

(24) 

(25) 

The equilibrium condition can be used in eq. (21) and (23). When substituting all variables and applying the 
equilibrium in eq. (24), the results give us the following static equations for terms of trade and capacity 

utilization 𝐸𝐷𝑆 =   𝑋𝑆 − (

1

𝑃

) 𝑋𝑁 = 0: 

Then substituting eq.(26), we have: 

𝑋𝑁 = 𝑃𝑋𝑆 

 

From the Saving-Investment balance condition in the north (𝐼𝑁 = 𝑆𝑁): 

𝑃 = [(𝜃𝑆 𝜃𝑁⁄

)(𝑢𝐾𝑁)𝜀𝑁(𝑎𝑆 𝐾𝑆⁄ )𝜀𝑆]1 (𝜇𝑁+𝜇𝑆−1)

In  the  long-run  the  capital  stock  grows  according  to  the  rates  of  capital  accumulation  in  the  two  regions 
(𝑔𝑖 = 𝐼𝑖 𝐾𝑖⁄ ). The short-run conditions are always satisfied (𝐸𝐷𝑖 = 0). In this sense accumulation in the north is 
given by: 

In the south, savings determine investments.  Southern workers do not save, only southern capitalists do save. 
The savings function is then given by the propensity to save times the profit share, times output: 

𝑔𝑁 = 𝛾0 + 𝛾0𝛾1 [𝑠𝑁𝜎𝑁 − 𝛾1]
 

⁄

(27) 

The investment function is then given by the value of total savings in domestic currency: 

𝑆𝑆 = 𝑠𝑆𝜎𝑆 𝐾𝑆 𝑎𝑆⁄  

𝐼𝑆 = 𝑃𝜉𝑆𝑆 

(28) 

(29) 

𝜉 is a constant with positive value. The next step is to define the savings – investment conditions for the south. 
Combining eq. (28) and (29) to the south we have the following equation for capital accumulation: 

When deriving eq.(25) we get the dynamic properties of the model. Terms of trade then fluctuate following the 
relationship between capital accumulation in the north and the south: 

𝑔𝑆 = 𝑠𝑆𝑃𝜉 𝜎𝑆 𝑎𝑆⁄  

(30) 

 

𝑃̂ = [1 (𝜇𝑁 + 𝜇𝑆 − 1)

⁄

](𝜀𝑁𝑔𝑁 − 𝜀𝑆𝑔𝑆) 

(31) 
 

Terms of trade (𝑃) fluctuates depending on the gap between investment (growth) in north and south weighted 
by their respective income elasticity of imports. Terms of trade here are not neutral in the long-run. 

5.  Expansion of the Dutt-Thirlwall Model 

The original Dutt model results in a one dynamic equation for the dynamics of the terms of trade. This depends 
on the gap between capital accumulation in the north and in the south. In this expansion we focus on creating a 
productivity  dynamics  that  is  able  to  define  other  patterns,  rather  than  a  monotonic  convergence  and/or 
divergence.

5.1. 

Productivity Dynamics 

In  eq.(9),  northern  price  levels  are  defined  as  function  of  mark-up  over  costs  𝑃𝑁 = (1 + 𝑧)𝑊𝑁𝑏𝑁.  From  this 
equation we introduce an initial productivity and wage rate dynamics to the north, which follows a constant rate 
of growth: 

 

̂ = −𝛽𝑁 
𝑏𝑁

𝑊𝑁̂ = 𝛽𝑁 

 

(32) 
 
(33) 

𝛽𝑁 is a constant. Labour productivity in the north (𝜆𝑁 =
) grows exogenously, and wages track productivity, 
growing both at the same rate. 𝑌𝑆 = 𝐾𝑆 𝑎𝑆⁄  remains for the south, considering that there is no idle capacity, and 
that the capital-output ratio is constant. 𝑊𝑆 𝑃𝑠⁄ = 𝑉𝑆 defines the value of real wages. In this sense, productivity 
and real  wages follow the same path,  growing according to  technological  progress.  Technological  progress  in 
the north is assumed constant and stable3. 

𝑁

1

In Dutt (2002), the real wages in the south (𝑉𝑆) are fixed. Capitalist’s income (𝑌𝑆,𝐾) in south is equal to 𝑌𝑆,𝐾 =
(1 − 𝑏𝑠𝑉𝑠)𝑃𝑠𝑌𝑆 and the share of that in total income is 𝜎𝑠 = (1 − 𝑏𝑠𝑉𝑠). We endogenize 𝑏𝑠 and 𝑉𝑠 developing a 
labor  productivity  dynamics.  There  is  also  the  need  to  specify  𝑏𝑠𝑉𝑠,  so  they  stay  within  bounds  (wage  share 
cannot be smaller than zero or higher than one). 

Labor productivity (𝜆𝑖) is the inverse of the unit labor requirement for the production of a good: 

Using this this definition, the productivity gap4 (𝐺) between north and south is: 

𝜆𝑖 =

1
𝑏𝑖

 

(36) 

𝑏𝑆
𝑏𝑁
̂ = 𝛽𝑁. We consider in the south an extra effect 
In eq.(32), productivity grows in the north at a constant rate 𝜆𝑁
which rises on this economy for being a laggard one, a gap dynamic effect. Labor productivity growth in south 
can  be  written  as  a  constant  rate  (𝛽𝑆)  plus  the  effect  of  the  productivity  gap,  which  we  put  as  a  catching-up 
effect: 

) =   ln (

𝐺 = ln (

𝜆𝑁
𝜆𝑆

(37) 

) 

Being 𝛽𝑆 < 𝛽𝑁, and considering the definition of productivity gap on eq.(37), we can work out the dynamics o 
the technology gap (𝐺̂) as: 

̂ = 𝛽𝑆 +  𝜌𝐺 
𝜆𝑆

(38) 

𝐺̂ = (𝛽𝑁 − 𝛽𝑆) − 𝜌𝐺 

(39) 

5.2.  Labor market and the Phillips curve 

A second addition to the model consist in developing a labor market dynamics. In order to do so we endogenize 
real wages. We use, in the southern economy, a modified version of the Phillips curve, relating real wages to 
the employment rate: 

𝑉𝑆̂ = −𝑚 + 𝑛 (

𝐿𝑆
Λ𝑆

) = −𝑚 + 𝑛𝑙𝑠 

(40) 

                                                           
3 We understand, on the other hand, the central aspect of evolutionary major technological change happening in waves. (Schumpeter, 
1939) 
4 Cimoli & Porcile  (2014) 

9 

 

m  and  n  are  constants.  𝐿𝑆  consists  on  total  employment,  and  Λ𝑆  the  total  workforce.  In  this  sense,  the 
employment rate (𝑙𝑠) can be defined as: 

𝑙𝑠 =

𝐿𝑆
Λ𝑆

 

(41) 

Here we observe that this addition changes the characteristics of the model. equations (12) - (16) stay the same, 
but the profit share 𝜎 = (1 − 𝑏𝑠𝑉𝑠) is no longer a constant. Defining the wage share in the south as 𝜔𝑆 = 𝑏𝑆𝑉𝑆, 
its growth rate is given by: 

The growth rate of the profit share in the south (σS) follows an opposite variation of the wage share (𝜔S): 

𝜔𝑆̂ = 𝑏𝑆

̂ + 𝑉𝑆̂ = −𝛽𝑆 − 𝜌𝐺 − 𝑚 + 𝑛𝑙𝑆 

 

(42) 

𝜎𝑆̂ = −𝜔𝑆̂ = 𝛽𝑆 + 𝜌𝐺 + 𝑚 − 𝑛𝑙𝑆 

 

(43) 

Equation  (27)  does  not  change.  But  for  equations  (30)  and  (31)  𝜎𝑆  becomes  a  variable,  not  a  constant 
(𝜀𝑁𝑔𝑁 − 𝜀𝑆𝑔𝑆).  If  we  expand  𝑔𝑁  and  𝑔𝑆  from 

parameter.  From  equation  (31)  we  have  that  𝑃̂ =

equations (27) and (30) respectivelly, we end up with the following equation for the evolution of the terms of 
trade:

5.3.  Employment rate, population growth and the Lewis dynamics 

We may consider two different situations that lead to the same result. The first occurs in an economy divided by 
a  traditional  and  a  modern  sector.  With  higher  labor  income  share,  workers  have  the  incentive  to  move  to 
formal/modern  activities  of  the  economy.  The  second  sitation  is  related  to  migration.  A  higher  wage  share 
incentivizes  workers  to  move  from  one  country  to  the  other  looking  for  better  life  conditions,  increasing  the 
labor supply in the receiver country. 

Considering a linear specification relating the increases in wage share (and reduction in profit share) in the labor 
supply we have: 

𝜑  is  the  constant  autonomous  population  growth  and  𝜓  is  a  constant  that  measures  the  elasticity  to  move  to 
from the traditional to the formal sector (migration cost). As we defined in eq.(41)  𝑙𝑆 = 𝐿𝑆/𝛬𝑆, then: 

Λ𝑆̂ = 𝜑 − 𝜓𝜎𝑆 

 

(46) 

̂ = 𝐿𝑆̂ − Λ𝑆̂ 
𝑙𝑠

(46) 

 

Total employment dynamics: 𝑏𝑆 =

̂ + 𝑌𝑆̂  

Employment rate dynamics: 𝑙𝑠

̂ = 𝐿𝑆̂ + Λ𝑆̂ = 𝑏𝑆

̂ + 𝑌𝑆̂ − Λ𝑆̂ 

As we have the capital-output labor 𝑏𝑆 = 𝐿𝑆/𝑌𝑆, the total labor growth in the south is 𝐿𝑆 = 𝑏𝑆𝑌𝑆. In growth 

rates: 

 

𝐿𝑆̂ = 𝑏𝑆

̂ + 𝑌𝑆̂  

(48) 

10 

From  Eq.  (10)  𝑌𝑆 = 𝐾𝑆 𝑎𝑆⁄ .  As  there  is  no  depreciation,  therefore  𝐾𝑆̂𝐾𝑆 = 𝐼𝑆.  From  the  Savings-Investment 
southern condition (𝐼𝑆 = 𝑃𝜉𝑆𝑆) and being 𝑆𝑆 = 𝑠𝑆𝜎𝑆𝑌𝑆, 𝐼𝑆 = 𝑃𝜉𝑠𝑆𝜎𝑆

. This result in: 

𝐾𝑆
𝑎𝑆

As 𝑎𝑆̂ = 0, 𝐾𝑆̂ = 𝑌𝑆̂  resulting in the dynamic equation for the employment rate. From 𝑙𝑆

In summary, we end up with a system of four differential equations:

𝐺̂ = (𝛽𝑁 − 𝛽𝑆) − 𝜌𝐺 

This  system  defines  the  north-south  dynamics  between  terms  of  trade,  distribution  in  the  south,  southern 
employment  rate  in  the  south  and  the  productivity  gap.  The  trajectory  defines  the  relationship  between  the 
short- and the long-run in the model.  The next step is to analyze the dynamic properties of this system. 

6.  Dynamic properties of the expanded model 

From  the  four  equations  of  our  system  we  analytically  calculate  the  steady  state  conditions  and  the  Jacobian 
studying the trajectory and stability conditions. 

̂ = 𝐺̂ = 0. The Jacobian is a matrix 
For the Steady State we set our dynamic variables equal to zero. 𝑃̂ = 𝜎𝑆̂ = 𝑙𝑆
of the partial derivatives of all pair of dynamic variables involved in the system. After computing the Jacobian 
we study the signs of all its elements one by one.  

The Steady State is (for the mathematical passages, see the annex):

between  𝑃 and 𝑙𝑆. 

 

7.  Defining values for each of the parameters. 

In this section we discuss the expected values for each parameter. In this way we can define the possible values 
for the Jacobian and the stability conditions of the model.

Dutt (2002) states that the variable 𝜉 is smaller than 1 and bigger than 0. 
Price  elasticity  of  imports  of  the  North  and  the  South  are  usually  considered  small  in  the  BPCM 
theory, what Blecker ((2016)) calls “elasticity pessimism”. Considering them n their absolute value 
𝜇𝑁 > 0 and 𝜇𝑆 > 0. We follow the Marshall-Lerner condition, in which  𝜇𝑁 + 𝜇𝑆 > 1. 
The same for point III. We consider 𝜇𝑁 ≈ 1 and 𝜇𝑆 ≈ 1 
According to Dutt (2002), when 𝜀𝑁   <  1, increases in northern income results in a lower proportion 
of  expenditure  in  the  Southern  good,  so  the  southern  good  is  income-inelastic.  As  increases  in 
southern income will result in a higher proportion of expenditure in the Northern good, 0 < 𝜀s < 1. 
The  value  of  the  income  elasticity  of  import  demand  is  always  higher  than  zero  (𝜀𝑁 > 0).  It  is 
possible to consider two cases, the one in which a higher income results in higher expenditure in the 
Northern good (0 < 𝜀𝑁 < 1). And the case in which a higher income results in higher expenditure in 
the Southern good (𝜀𝑁 > 1) – this is the one we decide. 
𝑠𝑁  consists  in  the  fraction  of  income  saved  by  capitalists.  As  defined  before  𝑠𝑁 =
consider 0 < 𝑠𝑁 < 1. 
Idem for point VII. 0 < 𝑠𝑆 < 1. 
From  the  model,  𝑏𝑆 = 𝐿𝑆 𝑌𝑆⁄ .  Using  the  PWT  we  can  calculate  these  values  from  many  countries

As observed in point IX, developing countries have higher values for the labor-output ratio, so 
0 < 𝑏𝑁 < 𝑏𝑆 < 1. 
𝛾0 and 𝛾1 are positive constants, which shows that the Northern investment rate depends on the rate 
of capacity utilization measured by 𝑌𝑁/𝐾𝑁, because higher capacity utilization implies more buoyant 
markets and higher profits. We consider 𝛾0 the animal spirit. It does not have an economic meaning 
in  itself,  but  we  consider  its  value  between  0  (low  capitalists  confidence)  and  1  (high  capitalists 
confidence).  0 < 𝛾0 < 1. 
𝛾1 > 0 is the sensitivity of capacity utilization changes on the investment-capital ratio. We consider 
this value close to 0 but positive. 𝛾1 ≈ 0. 

XIII.  𝑚 and 𝑛 are the effects on the southern real wage dynamics. 𝑚 is the constant rate of decrease in real 
wage growth. In this work we consider a small value (about 1% decrease maximum). So 0 < 𝑚 ≤ 1. 
XIV.  𝑛 is the elasticity of real wage to changes in the employment rate. It also has a value between 0 and 

1. 

XV.  The constant profit rate of the north follows the range between zero (all income goes to wages) and 

one (all income goes to profits). So 0 < 𝜎𝑁 < 1. 

XVI.  𝛽𝑆 and 𝛽𝑁 are the exogenous parameters in the growth rate of labor productivity. We consider that 
the  exogenous  rate  of  technical  change  improvements  is  higher  in  the  North  than  in  the  South: 
𝛽𝑁 > 𝛽𝑆. Usually this value is very close to zero.  

XVII.  According to the previous 𝛽𝑁 – Exogenous growth of labor productivity – between 0 and 0.1. So we 

have 0 < 𝛽𝑆 < 𝛽𝑁 < 0.1. 

XVIII. 𝜌 is the effect of changes in the gap on the evolution of labor productivity in the south. Increases in 
𝐺  also  increases  the  productivity  gap  and  have  negative  effects  on  the  southern  productivity.  We 
then  consider  𝜌  having  a  positive  value  (so  −𝜌  is  negative).  We  consider  it  usually  has  a  value 
between 0 and 1. So 0 < 𝜌 < 1. 

XIX.  𝜑 is the autonomous population growth.  In developed countries it is very often negative while still 
positive in many developing countries. We will consider it having a positive value very close to zero 
𝜑 > 0 and 𝜑 ≈ 0. 

XX.  𝜓  is  the  elasticity  of  the  labor  supply  to  increases  in  the  wage  share.  It  has  a  positive  number 

between zero and 1.

Based on these parameter values we are able to build some scenarios for our model.  We then define a baseline 
situation for the Southern and the Northern countries.  

8.  Scenarios 

 

15 

8.1.  Baseline 

The baseline model is built as part of an effort to create credible parameters for a  developing economy in the 
South  and  a  developed  in  the  North.  The  developing  economy  is  marked  by  a  low  industrialization  (capital-
output  ratio)  close  to  3  (levels  close  to  Mexico  and  Argentina).  It  follows  the  Marshall-Lerner  condition 
(𝜇𝑁 + 𝜇𝑆 > 1). The income elasticities of imports are higher in the north than in the south. Savings rate in the 
north is  around 35%  while in  the south it is  around 18%.  Initial value  for the profit rate in  the south  is  30%, 
being 40% in  the north.  Exogenous increase in  labor force is  about  4%  while the country shows higher labor 
force elasticity to increases in the wage share. The parameters used for our baseline are the following:

The baseline results show a situation in which the technology gap is constant at its initial level of 0.5. Terms of 
trade oscillate around a stable trend. Southern profit shares oscillate between the values of 29% and 31%. And 
the Employment rate between 92% and 93.5%.

Scenario 1: Declining terms of trade in a lagging behind scenario  

From this baseline we define a case in which the economy is under a more fragile situation. It consists in a less 
industrialized economy (smaller 𝑎𝑠), in which the learning process occurs at a slower pace (reduced 𝜌) and the 
autonomous productivity growth is smaller (reduction in 𝛽𝑆). It is also an economy in which there is a smaller 
elasticity to move from the traditional to the modern sector.

The structure of a less industrialized, more fragile economy, consist in specialization in the exports of products 
with  smaller  technology  intensiveness.  In  this  economy  there  are  smaller  learning  efforts  and  the  structural 
change goes towards less productive sectors. The results can be seen on Figure 2. This more fragile economy 
reaches an equilibrium hit a higher productive gap than the baseline model. 

The  Prebish-Singer  hypothesis  is  valid  in  this  scenario.  The  southern,  peripheral  county  has  a  decline  in  its 
terms  of  trade.  This  decline  follows  a  cyclical  adjustment  toward  a  new  equilibrium  value  (𝑃∗ = 0.182)  that 
would be reached after many time periods. Capital accumulation and domestic growth would follow the same 
trajectory as the terms of trade (𝑌̂𝑆 = 𝑔𝑆 = 𝑠𝑆̅ 𝑃𝜉 𝜎𝑆 𝑎𝑆̅̅̅)⁄

, showing a reduction in the growth rate. 

This  more  fragile  economy  also  shows  the  presence  of  higher  oscillations.  When  calculating  the  standard 
deviation  in  the  baseline  we  have  that  𝑆𝐷𝑏(𝑙𝑠) = 0.007  and  𝑆𝐷𝑏(𝜎𝑠) = 0.008.  For  scenario  1  we  have 
𝑆𝐷𝑠1(𝑙𝑆) = 0.046  and  𝑆𝐷𝑠1(𝜎𝑆) = 0.061.  We  see  a  high  increase  in  the  amplitude  of  the  oscillations.  The 
steady  state  values  are  equal.  However,  a  more  specialized  economy  shows  a  higher  endogenous  pattern  of 
volatility, increasing the amplitude of the oscillations. 

8.3. 

Scenario 2: Increases in the Terms of Trade and Catching-Up. 

In this scenario we emulate an economy which, starting from the baseline, focus on two main aspects: structural 
change and catching-up.  In this scenario we increase the capital-output ratio, the exogenous productivity rate, 
the catching-up and the rate to which workers from the traditional sector can move to the modern one.

This scenario 2 show the opposite situation compared to the previous scenario 1. The southern economy reduces 
the  productivity  gap  with  the  north.  There  is  economic  diversification  and  structural  change  towards  more 
productive sector. In this scenario, the country reverses the tendency to reduce its terms of trade, and increase 
its growth rate, rising the terms of trade. 

This  growth  and  structural  change  process  creates  oscillations.  However,  these  are  less  intense  then  when 
compared to baseline, resulting in smaller volatility than Scenario 1: 𝑆𝐷𝑠2(𝜎𝑆) = 0.048 and 𝑆𝐷𝑠2(𝑙𝑆) = 0.048.  

9.  Answer to the research questions 

RQ1:  How  do  the  Price  dynamics  affect  the  results  of  the  BPCM  when  we  assume  𝑷̂  endogenous  and 
𝑷̂ ≠ 𝟎?  What  conditions  the  behavior  of  the  Terms  of  Trade,  how  can  we  observe  a  Prebisch-Singer 
behavior (𝑷̂ < 𝟎) ?  

The  price  dynamics  directly  affect  the  behavior  of  the  effective  economic  growth,  as  we  have:  𝑌̂𝑆 = 𝑔𝑆 =
𝑠𝑆̅ 𝑃𝜉 𝜎𝑆 𝑎𝑆̅̅̅⁄ .  The  effective  growth  rate  will  then  depend  on  the  dynamic  behavior  of  prices  (𝑃)  (terms  of 
trade/real exchange rate) and income distribution (𝜎𝑆). This changes the structure of the BPCM in the sense that 
the in this scenario economic growth is dependent on price effects. Quantity effects also play a role, defining the 
behavior of income distribution. The final result for long-run economic growth is however in this scenario much 
more complex than the result highlighted in the Thirlwall model.  

The  Prebisch-Singer  hypothesis  can  be  observed  under  some  specific  conditions,  in  which  𝜀𝑆

).  Considering  the  northern  characteristics  as  fixed,  this  would  mean  that  a  decrease  in 

𝜀𝑁𝛾0 (1 +
industrialization (reduction of  𝑎𝑆), a smaller in the wage share (rise in  𝜎𝑆), rise in the propensity to save (𝑠𝑆) 
and a rise in the income elasticity of imports (𝜀𝑆) – reducing productive capacity and specialization result in a 
pattern in which there is a trend to a decrease in the terms of trade – and on economic growth.

RQ2: How can technology efforts and structural change relate to the Price Effects and economic growth? 
What  defines  the  conditions  to  a  virtuous  catching-up  process?  Are  the  countries  away  from  the 
technological frontier more fragile and volatile? 

 

19 

A  southern  country  that  does  not  advance  with  structural  change  and  learning  opportunities,  and  does  not 
include  workers  from  the  traditional  to  the  modern  sector,  has  the  tendency  to  follow  the  Prebisch-singer 
hypothesis. Specialization in low technology intensive sectors and a lack of learning opportunities will results in 
a decline in terms of trade (and economic growth). In terms of technology efforts this is an indirect effect, as 𝐺 
does not affect 𝑃, but 𝑙𝑆 and 𝜎𝑆. Increases in the technology gap reduce the growth rate of the employment rate, 
but increases the growth rate of the profit rate.  

RQ3: Considering the effects of volatility in the process of economic development. What determines the 
magnitude of the cycles? What are the impacts of a higher volatility? 

Following the ideas of the Goodwin model, cycles here come from the relationship between economic activity 
and income distribution. Oscillations are endogenous to all economies, as we can see in the baseline model. We 
observe that both a catching-up and a falling behind pattern raise volatility.  

From the analysis of the model, an increase in volatility rises when the absolute values of  

𝜕𝑙̂𝑆
𝜕𝜎𝑆

without changing their sign. As 

= −𝑛 and 𝑛 > 0, when 𝑛 increases we have higher oscillations. The same 

𝜕𝜎̂𝑆
𝜕𝑙𝑆

= 𝑃𝜉𝑠𝑆

𝑎𝑆

for when 

− 𝜓 rises its value. In this sense, industrialization reduces volatility (rise in 𝑎𝑆), as well 
as  a  reduction  in  the  elasticity  between  employment  rate  and  wages  (a  flexible  labor  market  rises  volatility). 
Increases  in  the  autonomous  propensity  to  save  rises  volatility,  as  well  as  economic  growth  (increases  in  the 
terms of trade). In this sense, growth brings an increase in volatility, but it can be compensated by increases in 
structural change.

RQ4:  Under  which  conditions  can  we  reach  a  virtuous  development  process  in  the  context  of  non-
neutrality of price effects? What are the effects on economic growth? 

Higher  growth  happens  when  𝑃 > 0,  so  the  south  can  grow  at  a  higher  rate  than  the  north.  This  occurs  in  a 
scenario  in  which  a  virtuous  structural  change,  learning  opportunities  and  high  quality  employment  are  a 
priority in the economic development of an economy, as we can see in Scenario 2.  

The  results  of  this  research  are  aligned  with  the  structuralist  perspective.  And  they  hold  in  the  BPCM 
framework even considering a case in which the Thirlwall law is not entirely valid.  

10. Conclusion 

This article expands the canonical Dutt (2002) model. Dutt, in a critique to an excessive focus of the literature 
on  the  Thirlwall  law,  highlights  some  usually  neglected  central  aspects  of  the  Thirlwall  framework:  uneven 
development and transition dynamics. The author endogenizes, from a North-South model, the behavior of the 
terms of trade in a balance of payments constrained model (BPCM) framework.  

Our  paper  adds  to  the  Dutt  (2002)  model  a  Goodwin  cyclical  dynamics  (using  a  Phillips  curve),  a  Lewisian 
labor market transition between traditional and modern sectors, and a productivity (and technological) catching-
up dynamics for the southern economy in relationship to the northern one. In this sense we extend to the BPCM 
a  post-keynesian  distributive  dynamics  and  a  structuralist-evolutionary  aspect  of  structural  change  and 
technological catching-up. 

In large part of the paper we focus on the development and consistency of our expanded model, which results in 
a 4-dymensional dynamic system. The value range defined for the parameters show  a convergence pattern with 
cycles. Cycles emerge from the relationship between distribution (profit share) and employment rate (economic 
activity).  This  cyclical  relationship  affects  the  terms  of  trade  dynamics,  which  adjusts  cyclically  to  its 

 

20 

equilibrium rate of growth. Productivity and technological catching-up occur when a southern country presents 
structural  change  towards  more  productive  sectors  and  when  there  are  conditions  to  benefit  from  learning 
opportunities. This catching-up virtuous patters has the effect of reducing endogenous volatility. 

From the scenarios we see that increases in industrialization and learning efforts generate a pattern with higher 
growth,  increases  in  the  terms  of  trade,  reduction  in  the  technology  catching-up  and  smaller  volatility  when 
compared to the falling behind scenario. 

The  main  question  in  this  article  concerns  what  happens  in  the  Thirlwall  framework  when  we  criticize  the 
assumption  of  price  neutrality,  offering  a  solution  to  the  transition  dynamics.  What  we  observe  is  that  it  is 
possible to have structuralist/evolutionary arguments in the Thirlwall framework even when the Thirlwall law is 
under  siege.  In  the  Thirlwall  law,  learning  and  structural  change  are  brought  to  the  model  by  endogenizing 
income elasticities of imports and exports (Cimoli & Porcile, 2014). In our expanded version of the BPCM, this 
comes from the behavior of productivity catching-up and terms of trade. The Prebisch-singer hypothesis can be 
reproduced from the expanded Thirlwall framework. We offer then a proposal to conciliate the theory of decline 
in the terms of trade to the balance of payments constrained model when prices are not neutral.
