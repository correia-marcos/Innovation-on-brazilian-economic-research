LOST IN TIME AND SPACE: THE DETERRENCE EFFECT OF CARTEL

BUSTS ON THE RETAIL GASOLINE MARKET

EESP - FUNDACAO GETULIO VARGAS

ABSTRACT. In this paper we intend to focus on the preventive goal of anti-cartel policy. We
investigate if cartel busts have an effect on prices, price margins and price variance in the
future knowing that a typical feature of cartel behavior is to increase prices and margins, as
well as to reduce price variance. We do that looking for the Brazilian case which we believe
is particularly apt to study this research question. Our results indicate that immediately after
a cartel bust, price levels and price margins drop for the municipality where the collusion
took place as well as for the markets that are somehow closer related to it (here expressed
by the cities in the same State as the municipality where the cartel operated). The results
for price variance, nonetheless, are inconclusive since we don’t identify a difference in the
coefﬁcient of variance between the markets during the cartel operation. Still these changes
are largely neutralized after a few weeks in the market as a whole, although there seem to be
a long lasting reverse to the mean for the collusive and the nearby markets, that is, they seem
to obey the market rule after the breakdown of the cartel.

Key-words: cartel bust, deterrence effect, retail gasoline stations.

RESUMO. Neste trabalho tem como objetivo o analisar o efeito preventivo da política
anti-cartel. Investigamos se rupturas do cartel têm efeito sobre os níveis de preços, as margens
e variâncias de preços no futuro, sabendo que uma característica típica do comportamento de
cartel é aumentar preços e margens, bem como reduzir a variação de preços. Nós fazemos
isso olhando para o caso brasileiro que acreditamos ser particularmente apto a estudar esta
questão. Nossos resultados indicam que, imediatamente após a ruptura de um cartel, os
níveis e as margens de preços caem para o município em que houve a colusão, bem como
para os mercados que estão de alguma forma relacionados mais proximamente a eles (aqui
expressos pelas cidades pertencentes ao mesmo Estado em houve o funcionamento do cartel).
Os resultados para variância de preço, no entanto, não são conclusivos, uma vez que não
identiﬁcam a diferença no coeﬁciente de variação entre os mercados durante a operação de
cartel. Ainda assim essas mudanças são em grande parte neutralizadas no mercado como um
todo depois de algumas semanas seguidas a ruptura, embora pareça ter havido uma inversão
à média que se manteve nos municípios onde houve o conluio e os mercados próximos a eles,
isto é, eles parecem obedecer a regra de mercado após o colapso do cartel.

Palavras-chave: ruptura do cartel, efeito dissuasão, postos de combustíveis.

1. INTRODUCTION

The design and application of competition law, in particular law against price ﬁxing,
involves a combination of corrective, retributive and preventive justice: society deems it
is fair to punish parties guilty of a price ﬁxing offense (correction); sometimes forcing them
to compensate victims, that is, buyers (retribution); hoping that the example of justice meted
out will move ﬁrms away from price ﬁxing in the future (prevention).

In this paper, we focus on the preventive goal of anti-cartel policy. Speciﬁcally, we ask
the following question: do cartel busts have an effect on the likelihood of cartel-like prices
in the future? This is not exactly the right question when it comes to prevention; the right
question would be: do cartel busts reduce the likelihood of future cartels? However, knowing
that a typical feature of cartel behavior is to increase prices and margins, as well as to reduce
price variance and volatility, we can ask the question of whether cartel busts have an effect
on price levels, price margins and price volatility.

In order to address our basic research question, we analyze data from Brazilian gasoline
retail pricing. Our data includes retail and wholesale prices at the retail pump level for
a large sample of gasoline stations across Brazil’s 26 states, from July 2001 to December
2011. During this period, many cases of cartel behavior were discovered and punished.

The Brazilian case is particularly apt to study the research question at hand for three
reasons. First, while there is a federal competition policy authority (Conselho Administrativo
de Defesa Econômica, or CADE for short), retail gasoline price-ﬁxing cases are typically
initiated at the municipal level by the local prosecutor as a criminal act. Second, gasoline
producers and retailers have separate ownership by law; and while some retailers own
multiple stations, downstream ownership is typically local. Third, Brazil is a large country,
and while all states share the same language and national media, there is also considerable
separation across states in the way news are presented (for example, a considerable fraction
of newspapers readership is at the state level).

We expect that immediately after a cartel bust, price levels and margins drop; and price
volatility increases. However, these changes are probably largely neutralized after a few
weeks. Moreover, we believe that these effects are greatest in the municipality where the
cartel bust takes place; lower in neighboring municipalities; and lowest (essentially zero) in
out-of-state municipalities. This is essentially the research question we want to answer. In
other words, we would like to be able to answer if and how the effects of a cartel bust are
lost in time and space.

There is a large body of literature on cartel screening and the internal functioning of
cartels. In the ﬁrst group Harrington [2005b], Abrantes-Metz et al. [2006], Ellison [1994]
among many others suggest many different techniques on how to identify cartel behavior.
In the second group Porter and Zona [1993], Asker [2010], Clark and Houde [2014] give
detailed information on how cartels operate and how they create incentives to sustain the
agreement.

At the same time, the impact of regulatory activities is believed to be of great importance to
law enforcement, which on its turn can inﬂuence the companies pricing behavior. This idea
was ﬁrst introduced by Stigler [1966] in which the author presents a quantitative notion of
the effects of the antitrust laws. He concludes that his ﬁndings were sparse and unassertive.
Stigler [1966] states that the Sherman Act had a modest effect in reducing concentration, but
it reduced the availability of the most efﬁcient methods of collusion and thereby reduced the
amount and effects of collusion.

Antitrust enforcement can chance the ﬁrms’ perception regarding the probability of
detection and conviction if charged for anti-competitive activities. For that matter, we would

2

expect prices to fall across all markets in response to an antitrust enforcement. Theoretical
and empirical works predict that the probability of prosecution and subsequent penalty deter
anticompetitive behavior, with deterrence effects declining over time. Feinberg [1980] and
Block et al. [1981] present models demonstrating this features.

Feinberg [1980] examines the effects of antitrust indictment on subsequent ﬁrm behavior;
the results presented indicate that the Sherman Act charges against a ﬁrm hold a deterrent
impact on deviations of price from cost, lowering the ﬁrms’ market power (represented by
the Lerner Index) by more than two percentage points.
In addition the author ﬁnds that
indictments against other ﬁrms in the industry tend to make a ﬁrm’s pricing behavior more
cautious, although this result is somewhat weak. The author makes no statement regarding
the timing of any price effects of antitrust activity, owing to the fact that he did not dispose
of time series data.

Block et al. [1981] formulate and test a model of collusive pricing in the presence of
public and private antitrust enforcement. The authors show that a cartel’s optimal price
is an intermediate price between the competitive price and the price that the cartel would
set in the absence of antitrust enforcement, that is, the cartel price depends on the levels
of antitrust enforcement efforts and the penalties charged by the antitrust authority in case
of conviction. Applying to the bread industry, Block et al. [1981] ﬁnd that: (i) increasing
antitrust enforcement capacity or ﬁling a price-ﬁxing complaint had the deterrent effect of
reducing industry’s markups; (ii) a price-ﬁxing case against bakers in one city induces bakers
in neighboring cities to reduce markups; and (iii) if discovered and prosecuted, convicted
ﬁrms tend to reduce their markups in the following year. Importantly, the authors ﬁnd that
the effective deterrent mechanism to price ﬁxing was not the ordinary government-imposed
ﬁnes but the credible threat of large damage awards to private class actions (treble damage
in the case of the U.S. antitrust authority ruling).

Many other studies follow trying to ﬁll this literature gap and the results as to the
advantages of the antitrust enforcement as a deterrence mechanism on price-ﬁxing cases are
inconclusive. Some studies are in line with Feinberg [1980] and Block et al. [1981] arguing
to the beneﬁts of the antitrust activity, such as Feinberg [1986] which found evidence of
relatively short-term deterrence effects but little long-term impact when examining European
antitrust cases. Clarke and Evenett [2003] analyze a global cartel and ﬁnd evidence that the
cartel inﬂicted greater harm in economies without active antitrust enforcement measures 1.
Coatney and Tack [2014] analyze the impacts of an antitrust investigation on the
purchasing practices of a buying collaboration and its common bidding agent. They ﬁnd that
auction prices in the targeted auctions: (i) signiﬁcantly increased as soon as the targets were
made aware they were under investigation; (ii) remained higher as long as the investigation
was open; and (iii) systematically declined to the same low pre-knowledge state after the
closure of the investigation without prosecution.

Finally, Block and Feinstein [1986] evaluate how the threat of antitrust enforcement spills
over from one industrial submarket to another through a formal model later applied to the
highway construction industry. This study is closely related to ours regarding its objective.
The authors ﬁnd that primary states - a state which has suppliers in common with at least
one state where an indictment has already occurred - are more responsive than the remaining
states. Surprisingly, the authors do not ﬁnd stronger deterrent effect of antitrust enforcement
in states where an indictment occurred when comparing to non-indictment states.

Our analysis also explore the spill over effects of an antitrust action as a deterrence
mechanism in other markets. Our results indicate that the deterrence effect is indeed higher

1Other papers that defend the beneﬁt of an active competition agency are: Baarsma et al. [2012], Werden
[2003], Werde(2008), among others.

3

for the indictment markets (primary states in Block and Feinstein [1986] terminology) since
their shift from the market norm is higher than the others and they just as well converge to
the market norm post cartel bust.

Other studies ﬁnd mixed evidences regarding the advantages of a competition agency.
Feinberg [1984] accesses weather the various stages of the antitrust process inﬂuenced
pricing behavior. Some evidence of a deterrent effect is found with real prices lower than
their pre-investigation level following the conclusion of the case; a major part of the pricing
reaction occurs prior to the ﬁling of formal charges. The author also provides additional
evidence of the existence of such a short-term ’strategic’ reaction of price reduction to
the onset of investigation in a sample of industries for which investigation never led to
indictment. He suggest that different industries should bring different deterrence effects
on future prices and indicate that the deterrence effect of an indictment should weaken over
time2.

Lastly, some papers argue against an active antitrust agency. Sproul [1993] found no
signiﬁcant effects of antitrust prosecution on prices charged by ﬁrms indicted for price ﬁxing
when analyzing U.S. antitrust cases. Also Crandall and Winston [2003] assesses the effects
of antitrust policy and enforcement on consumer welfare and ﬁnd no evidence that antitrust
policy in the areas of monopolization, collusion, and mergers has provided much beneﬁt to
consumers and, in some instances, they ﬁnd evidence that it may have lowered consumer
welfare. They also do not ﬁnd any evidence that antitrust policy has deterred ﬁrms from
engaging in actions that could harm consumers. Further, Newmark [1988] re-access Block
et al. [1981] empirical results and deny them, showing that the deterrence effect found by
Block et al. [1981] disappear when using a more appropriate dataset to the same problem 3.
In this paper, we focus on the deterrent effect of cartel busts on pricing of the
municipalities where the collusive activity was uncover as well as in other, geographically,
close and distant markets. The deterrent effects are only likely to occur if ﬁrms’ believe that
the uncover of speciﬁc cases raises the likelihood of future cartel detection by the antitrust
authority, modifying their pricing behavior.

Our hypothesis is that the closer the market is to the busted case the stronger should be the
ﬁrms reaction to the collapse of the anti-competitive activity because: (i) it will have easier
and faster access to the news; and (ii) it will assume that the antitrust agency will analyze
nearby markets in conjunction to the uncovered one even if solely to use as a comparison
because of market similarities as well as common suppliers.

We believe our work is relevant as it contributes to the literature that access the
effectiveness of cartel busts as a deterrence mechanism. We do ﬁnd that the deterrence effect
is limited to reverse the busted and the nearby market prices and margins to the national
average which is maintained over time, although no effect of price/margin reduction has
been encounter in the market as a whole. That is, we ﬁnd a restricted deterrence effect of
cartel busts on time and space.

2. DATA

The data used in this study is from the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP),
Sistema de Levantamento de Preços (SLP), that comprises weekly data from July 2001
through December 2011 (548 weeks) for 555 municipalities in Brazil, approximately 10%
of the municipalities in the country.

2Other papers that are inconclusive with respect to the beneﬁts of an antitrust agency are: Baker [2003], Ciarreta
[2012] and Cyrenne [1999], among others
3Smith et al. [1987] and Thompson and Kaserman [2001] also ﬁnd evidence against the competition authority’s
practices.

4

The data corresponds to weekly gasoline prices on the gas station level. Not all stations are
audited on a weekly basis, in fact the number of gas stations audited each week is previously
determined. The assortment of gas stations that will be audit each week is randomly assigned
by the national agency, making the dataset an unbalanced panel. Note that the gas station
employees do not know which gas stations have been assigned until the agency’s technician
is at the designated stations.

It is important to mention that during this period eighteen cases of cartel activity were
uncover and condemned in Brazil. Mostly they were investigated by CADE because of
a previous criminal investigation by the local prosecutor authority. There are evidence of
anti-competitive activity in Bauru (SP), Belo Horizonte (MG), Caxias do Sul (RS), Cuiabá
and Várzea Grande (MT), Florianópolis (SC), Goiânia (GO), Guaporé (RS), Lages (SC),
Londrina (PR) and its metropolitan region, Manaus (AM), Recife (PE) and its metropolitan
region, Santa Maria (RS), Teresina (PI) and Vitória and its metropolitan region (ES). These
cases were uncovered and then analyzed and condemned by the Brazilian Antitrust Authority
(CADE).

Among 5,287,996 observations compiled 5,247,280 (99.23%) reported prices for gasoline.
These gas stations had their prices measured during 548 weeks (Jul/2001 through Dec/2011),
covering on average 9,989.09 gas stations per week (minimum of 1 and maximum of 12,690)
and 604 municipalities, with 32,715 gas stations overall in the sample. Each municipality
had on average 66.44 gas stations audited each week (minimum of 1 and maximum of 840),
although that varies according to the size of the municipality as well as the time within the
survey. In the beginning, the survey had a much smaller scale than it has in the more recent
period.

The dataset contains information on prices of retail and acquisition of gasoline for each
gas station sampled. We will take the prices of which the retailer buys gasoline from the
distributor (the acquisition price) as a cost proxy. We understand that there are many other
costs related to the operation of a gas station such as labor and rent but we believe this is the
main cost. That is, with the acquisition price even if we don’t know the exact cost function
of the ﬁrm we have the single most important variable cost of the business which is the
price with which the establishment acquires its main retail product4. The data also contains
information on its location/address, company owner, and brand in the case which the station
is not independent and has a distributor associated with it.

We have also included data on automobile ﬂeet for all municipalities. The data is of
monthly frequency, so for the weeks that correspond to the same month the values were
repeated among those weeks.

Finally, we obtain detailed information on each cartel case, including relevant dates,
through court ﬁles. Primarily, we are interested in identifying the exact or most approximate
date when the cartel was uncover. This means not necessarily when the antitrust agency
or the local court started investigating it but rather when the participants of the collusive
agreement learned that they where being indicted. Other relevant dates are also included.

In what follows we will describe the variables that will be used as well as provide some

descriptive statistics.

2.1. Dependent Variables. Knowing that a typical feature of cartel behavior is to increase
prices and margins, as well as to reduce price variance, we will analyze the effect of cartel
busts on price levels (natural logarithm of price), price margins measured in percentage

4The cost data is not reported for every single data entry. In this sample, 65.70% of the gas stations reported
the price with which they acquired the gasoline they were retailing. For the remainders we input the average
acquisition price of the referred week. From now on this price will be referred as the cost proxy variable.

points (we constructed the price margins using our cost proxy variable) and price variance
(measure by the coefﬁcient of variation).

SdP ricect

¯Pct

where i indexes each gas station at city c in week t. P is price, ¯P is the average price

across all gas stations i and SdP rice stands for standard deviation of prices.

2.2. Independent Variables. We have variables that
indicate the collusive periods -
d_cartel - as well as the cities where they took place - d_M. We have also created a variable
- d_S - that represents the States where there was a cartel excluding the cities where the cartel
took place. We use this variable to represent a closer related market, via news or business
related matters. Finally, among the variables that we are interested we have d_bust_Xw
where Xw represents 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks following a cartel bust. The 2w time
frame represents the time from the bust until 2 weeks after, 4w is from 2 to 4 weeks, 8w is
from 4 to 8 weeks and so forth; witch means that these variables are complementaries and
have no intersection between them.

We interact these variables to get the effect of a cartel bust on the city that the collusion
took place - d_bustxw*d_M -, on the state to which this city belongs - d_bustxw*d_S -, and
the overall market - d_bustxw - during the above mentioned time frames.

Finally, other variables included as control variables are the number of stations in the
market, the price of acquisition of gasoline, a measure of number of different brands and the
proportion of branded and independent stations5 in the market.

3. RESULTS

We are interested in the effect that a cartel bust has on price, price margin and price
variability in the municipality that it took place, in the in-state municipalities (closer cities)
and in out-of-state municipalities. As well as how this effect, if existent, behaves over time.
For that we estimate the following model using cross-section as well as panel data. We
also estimate the models in aggregate terms, that is, using each city’s weekly average variable
to check if the results hold in aggregate terms.

Yit =

(1)

β0 + β1 ∗ cartelict + β2 ∗ cartelict ∗ d_Mict + β3 ∗ cartelict ∗ d_Sict

+Γ ∗ d_bustxwict + Θ ∗ d_bustxwict ∗ d_Mict + Ω ∗ d_bustxwict ∗ d_Sict

+α ∗ controls + µi + δt + it

where:
Yit can be price (ln_price), price margins (M argins_pp) or price dispersion

(Coef_V ariation) depending on the equation;

cartelit is a cartel dummy that equal 1 for the weeks when there was an operating cartel

and zero otherwise;

d_M embers is a dummy that equals to 1 for the gas stations that took part in the collusive
agreement and zero otherwise. When the Union was responsible for organizing the cartel
I assume all the gas stations were involved in the agreement and so all the gas stations
operating in that municipality at that time were considered members;

d_M is a dummy that equals to 1 for the gas stations operating in the municipalities where
a collusion took place at some point in time (excluding the gas station that were members of
the cartel) and zero otherwise. When all the gas stations took place in the agreement (case in
which the cartel was organized by the Union) this variable is zero for the municipality since
the effect of the cartel bust in the municipality excluding the cartel members is nil.

d_S is a dummy that equal 1 for all municipalities inside the State where there was a cartel
except for the city where the cartel actually happened (since they are represented by d_M)
and zero otherwise.

d_bustxwit is the dummy variables that indicate the time after a cartel bust, where xw can
represent weeks 2 (0-2 weeks following the bust), 4 (2-4 weeks following the bust), 8 (4-8
weeks following the bust), 12 (8-12 weeks following the bust), 16 (12-16 weeks following
the bust) and 20 (16-20 weeks following the bust) as described above. The dummies are
equal to 1 for the x weeks appointed following a cartel bust (for the entire sample) and zero
otherwise;

µi is the gas station ﬁxed effect in the panel version and is the municipality’s ﬁxed effect

in the cross-section version;

δt is the time ﬁxed effect (weekly measured);
ict is the error term.
Table 2 reports the results from our estimates. Columns (1) and (2) are estimated in
cross-section data using city’s ﬁxed effects. In addition, columns (2) incorporates time ﬁxed
effects. Columns (3) and (4) are estimated using panel data with gas station ﬁxed effects,
with (4) adding time ﬁxed effects.

From the results regarding prices, we obtain that during a cartel, prices tend to be higher
in the municipalities where the collusion takes place, but also in the State to which they
belong as it can be seen in equation (4) which includes time ﬁxed effects. Following our
intuition, the effect is larger at the municipality than at the State level but we can still
observe a negative externality from the anti-competitive agreement on the geographically
nearby markets. Following the cartel bust we observe that the collusive market’s price
immediately reverts to the national average. The non-signiﬁcance of the coefﬁcient in any
direction (positive or negative) indicates that there is no shift of the city in relation to the
overall market. There is, nonetheless, a shift towards the average.
The variable d_bust2wict ∗ d_Sict indicates that immediately following a cartel uncover
the other state municipalities still charge prices above the market average but is effect is
dissipated after only two weeks. This is most likely due to the time news take to arrive to
more distant locations. We also notice that during weeks 5 till 12 following a cartel bust
gasoline prices in the cities that were colluding are signiﬁcantly below average, but other
than that, the effect of an antitrust investigation and operation seems to have no impact of
reducing prices below average in the municipality, state or national levels, even though it is
successful in reverting prices back to the market average. This is seen by noticing that the
interaction variables on city and State - d_bustxwict ∗ d_Mict and d_bustxwict ∗ d_Sict - are
not signiﬁcantly different from zero and neither is the bust variable - d_bustxwict. With that,
we take that the deterrence effect on the extensive market is non existent, but it is successful
in preventing prices in the cities and state municipalities to remain above the market average.
Moving to the analysis of price margins we observe that margins are consistently higher
in the cartel municipalities but lower in-State municipalities. It is also interesting to notice
that the coefﬁcient on d_cartel - negative and signiﬁcant - indicates that the cartel period is
a time for low price margins in the overall market, that is, cartel periods are periods where
the overall market tend be experiencing below average margins, although this result is not
sustained in the panel estimation with time ﬁxed effects. With respect to the deterrence affect
post-bust, again we observe a reverse to overall market price margin on the municipality and
also in the in-State markets. Columns (1) through (3) indicate that there is an increase in
the overall market price margin average during this period with respect to the overall market
during periods not affected by a cartel or a cartel bust. This is seen by the coefﬁcients in the
out-of-state variables - d_bustxwict - that are positive and signiﬁcant.

Finally, the results regarding price variance are not very conclusive. The cartel variables
indicate that during collusive periods the overall market is undertaking a lower variance
period and that the municipality where the cartel took place does not behave different than
the national market, that is, it doesn’t stray far from the market rule, although this is not
sustained when we include time ﬁxed effects on the equations. Independently of the equation,
the in-state municipalities clearly have higher dispersion of prices than the overall market
which would indicate that the nearby cities are not inﬂuenced by the collusive agreement.
The same pattern is repeated after the bust with the in-state municipalities having higher
dispersion and the collusive and the overall market behaving like the period unaffected by
a cartel or its bust. It is only 9th week following a cartel that the collusive market seem to
increase its price variance, which doesn’t last after the 12th week.

The explanation we ﬁnd for this rather odd results considering price variance is that: (i)
these cartels in most cases are not perfect cartels in the sense that all the gas stations in that
market participate, but rather some of the competitors ﬁx prices through agreements which
implies that variance not necessarily decreases substantially; (ii) once the cartel is uncover,
the competitors, including the ones that did not participate on the cartel feel threatened and
for that matter tend to avoid deviate from the market norm.

10

Overall, we conclude that: (i) during cartel period the anti-competitive agreement seem
to generate a negative externality on its neighbors in terms of prices even though it doesn’t
translate into higher margins than the overall market (represented here by the municipalities
in the same State); (ii) this cannot be evidenced by lower price variance as we would expect
it would; and (iii) the deterrence effect of a cartel bust seem to work on the city and the
State where the cartel took place as to revert the price and margin to the market average but
not reducing them. This effect is sustained over time since prices and margins don’t rise
again, however, it is lost in space - it does not reach further markets - as evidences by the
non-signiﬁcance of the out-of-state variables - d_bustxwict.
3.1. Robustness Check. We now turn to a robustness check where instead of representing
the post bust period with dummy variables we try to model the price, margins and variance
trend trajectory for the 20 weeks following the uncover of a cartel. We create a variable t that
is deﬁned as the current week minus the week when the cartel was busted for the interval
up to 20 weeks after the bust; assuming value zero before and after this period. We then
calculate the quadratic and the cubic terms of it and include them when they help to better
specify the path followed by the variables after the bust. In addition, we interact with the
dummy for municipality and in-state municipalities in the same fashion as previously done.

Thus, we estimate the equation below:

Yit = β0 + β1 ∗ cartelict + β2 ∗ cartelict ∗ d_Mict + β3 ∗ cartelict ∗ d_Sict

+Γ ∗ trendict + Θ ∗ trendict ∗ d_Mict + Ω ∗ trendict ∗ d_Sict

(2)
where trendict can be t, t2 and/or t3.

+α ∗ controls + µi + δt + it

Table 4 presents the results for equation 2. For the price equations we conﬁrm the result
that the collusion agreement has negative externalities on the in-state markets, translated
here by positive and signiﬁcant coefﬁcients on the cartelict ∗ d_Sict variable. The trajectory
of prices post cartel uncover indicate that prices initiate a trend of decrease in prices at an
essentially constant rate, but the same cannot be said about the deterrence effect in other
markets, in-state or out-of-state. This would translate into the fact that the uncover of a
cartel has no signiﬁcant impact in terms of deterrence in the markets except for the one
where the collusion took place. The exact same conclusions can be taken when we analyze
market margins.

In regards to the coefﬁcient of variation we can’t identify any difference between the
variation in the collusive market and the more distant markets during cartel period, whilst
the in-state markets present higher price variance. Still, the post bust period maintains the
same behavior. With respect to the price variance in the in-state markets it presents a positive
and signiﬁcant trajectory of price variance but the coefﬁcients are essentially zero.

We have also estimated the models using the data collapse on weekly average variables
and with city ﬁxed effect as oppose to gas station ﬁxed effects. The results are fairly similar
and corroborate the pattern seen in the disaggregate data.

4. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we intended to focus on the preventive goal of anti-cartel policy. We
investigated if cartel busts have an effect on prices, price margins and price variance in the
future knowing that a typical feature of cartel behavior is to increase prices and margins, as
well as to reduce price variance.

We believe the Brazilian case is particularly apt to study this research question because
there is a federal competition policy authority, but retail gasoline price-ﬁxing cases are
typically initiated as a criminal offense at the municipal level by the local prosecutor. Also,
gasoline producers and retailers have separate ownership; and while some retailers own
multiple stations, downstream ownership is typically local. Finally, there is also considerable
separation across states in Brazil in the way news are presented in addition to the national
media.

Our results indicate that immediately after a cartel bust, price levels and price margins drop
for the municipality where the collusion took place, not below the market rule but it is no
longer shift upwards as it is during cartel activity, as well as for the markets that are somehow
closer related to it (here expressed by the cities in the same State as the municipality where
the cartel operated). The results for price variance, nonetheless, are inconclusive since we
don’t identify a difference in the coefﬁcient of variance between the markets during the cartel
operation. We do ﬁnd that during the collusive period in-state municipalities have higher
price variance but the price variance in the collusive municipality is not different than the
overall market during or off cartel periods.

Very little is seen in terms of over compensating the collusive period, that is, prices and
margins don’t go substantially low in the municipalities where the cartel took place and
price variance doesn’t became higher after a cartel uncover, mostly there seem to be a long
lasting reverse to the mean for the collusive and the nearby markets, that is, they seem to
obey the market rule after the breakdown of the cartel. This means that even though the
deterrence effect is not persistently strong in the overall market it is successful in avoiding
the re-insurgency of the cartelized market. That is, the deterrence effect is greatest in the
municipality where the cartel bust took place; lower in the municipality that take part in the
same state; and lowest (essentially zero) in out-of-state municipalities. In other words, the
effects of a cartel bust are lost in time and space.
