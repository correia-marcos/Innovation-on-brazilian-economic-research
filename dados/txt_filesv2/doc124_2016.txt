Abstract

This paper uses a principal-agent model to investigate how public school managers react to government
incentives based on previous school performance. Using data from the Brazilian Student Evaluation Exam
(Prova Brasil) and the School Census, we estimate a managerial effort function by quantile regression. The
ﬁndings show a regular non-linear relationship between managerial effort and lagged school performance,
indicating that marginal effort is decreasing when a previously ineffective school manager becomes effective
on reaching a performance goal. This evidence is in line with the adopted theoretical approach and provides
new parameters for educational policies designs.
Keywords: School management, Managerial effort, Educational goals, Asymmetric information.

Resumo

Este trabalho utiliza um modelo de principal-agente para investigar como diretores de escolas públicas
reagem a incentivos do governo com base no desempenho escolar defasado. Usando dados da Prova Brasil
e do Censo Escolar, estimamos uma função de esforço gerencial por regressão quantílica. Os resultados
mostram uma relação não-linear com regularidade entre esforço gerencial e desempenho escolar defasado,
indicando que o esforço marginal é decrescente quando um diretor previamente ineﬁcaz atinge uma meta
de desempenho escolar. Essa evidência está em linha com a abordagem teórica adotada e fornece novos
parâmetros para formulação de políticas educacionais.

1. Introduction

In Brazil, one can say that the purpose of universal primary education has been achieved. According to
the Population Censuses of 1991 and 2010, conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
(Instituto Brasileiro de Geograﬁa e Estatística - IBGE, 2013), the school attendance of individuals between
6 and 14 years of age reached 96.7% in 2010, from a frequency rate of 75.5% at the beginning of the 1990s;
furthermore, the population’s illiteracy rate at 15 years of age or older decreased from 20.1% to 9.6%, a
result possibly associated with the universalization of elementary education in the country.

Despite this improvement, the quality of education in Brazil is well below the levels observed in devel-
oped countries. According to the report of results from the Programme for International Student Assessment
(PISA) of 2012, provided by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Brazil

is in 58th place among the 65 countries evaluated in the average score in mathematics, surpassed by Latin
American countries such as Costa Rica, Uruguay, Mexico, and Chile (OECD, 2014). In this environment
of low-quality education, the increase in average schooling in Brazil may not have the expected effective-
ness in economic growth, given the direct relationship between the development of cognitive skills and the
dynamism of an economy (Hanushek and Woessmann, 2008, Hanushek, 2013).

A relevant question for empirical research on education is the understanding of the role of public schools
in producing real differences for students in learning gains and not merely replicating the socioeconomic
conditions that are beyond the control of school management (Hanushek, 1986). In this sense, the institu-
tional dimension that governs incentives for the degree of commitment of public school manager1 is critical
to the quality of the educational system, especially when the mechanisms to control managerial effort are
not well deﬁned and/or have informational restrictions on behalf of the authorities responsible for all schools
of a given region.

Studies on education have revealed that the school manager, as the school’s leader, plays an important
role in the educational outcomes of students (Eberts and Stone, 1988, Brewer, 1993, Ross and Gray, 2006,
Gates et al., 2006, Robinson et al., 2008, Béteille et al., 2011, Coelli and Green, 2012, Miller, 2013). Ac-
cording to Béteille et al. (2011), this role proves to be greater in schools with an unfavorable socioeconomic
context, low levels of educational performance, and a greater number of inexperienced teachers.

Additionally, the effects of the management on school performance occur through a variety of mecha-
nisms, including the following: the motivation of the school’s staff, composed of ofﬁcials and teachers; the
articulation of educational vision and goals; the resolution of interpersonal conﬂicts at school; the alloca-
tion of school resources; and the development of organizational structures to support teaching and learning
(Eberts and Stone, 1988, Ballou and Podgursky, 1995, Grissom and Loeb, 2011, Loeb et al., 2012).

In Brazil, much of the literature has been devoted to researching the relationship between the socioe-
conomic background of students and the results on educational performance indicators (Gomes-Neto and
Hanushek, 1994, Soares and Andrade, 2006, Machado and Gonzaga, 2007, Sampaio et al., 2011, Almeida,
2014). The documented results conﬁrm the relevance of the socioeconomic background of students in
academic performance, showing that Brazilian schools generally have little effect on cognitive gains.

In this context, the literature on school management remains in its infancy, meaning much of the ev-
idence found is based only on empirical relationships. On the other hand, as noted by Ferris (1992), the
interests of the public administration (principal) and the school manager (agent) cannot be the same. The
school manager may have either different conceptions, multiple purposes and deﬁnitions of educational
performance or other goals that conﬂict with the objectives of the public administration (Dixit, 2002). Such
purposes are both legitimate and uncontradictory, but they compete with each other for the scarce resources
that schools have. Thus, the principal-agent conﬂict can arise when higher authorities (such as state and
local governments) and the school manager choose different purposes.

In this paper we uses a theoretical principal-agent model that incorporates asymmetric information in the
relationship between local government administration and school manager. In particular, we explore how
managers react to government signaling mechanisms based on previous performance (achieving educational
goals).

In addition to the introduction, the article has 5 other parts. Section 2 presents the principal-agent
theoretical model. The empirical strategy used to evaluate the theoretical propositions for the Brazilian case
is detailed in Section 3. In Section 4, the database, sample selection, and variables used are described. In
Section 5, there is a discussion of the results. Lastly, Section 6 is reserved for ﬁnal remarks.

1In this paper, the term school manager is used as equivalent of school principal to avoid confusion with the expression of the

principal-agent model.

2. Asymmetric information and incentives for school management

The relationship between managers of public schools and rulers can involve costs caused by information
asymmetries (Ferris, 1992). Generally, public school managers better know their own level of effort2 than
the municipal, state, or federal administrator, which can induce changes in behavior characterized by the
misalignment of interests. By contrast, the means available to the government to monitor the activities of
the school managers, such as school indicators on standardized tests from previous years, are restricted
and limited. According to Dixit (2002), the use of such information may generate useful signals for the
government to devise incentives and therefore to change the behavior of school managers in terms of effort.
The model developed below, inspired on Hart (1983), Dixit (2002), Cahuc and Zylberberg (2004), Ed-
mans et al. (2009), highlights problems involved in the principal-agent relationship in a context of asym-
metric information. However, we emphasize and adapt this problem in the case of public schools. Public
school managers represent the agent and the government (municipal or state), the principal. In the ﬁrst
part of this section, the determinants of the agent’s managerial effort and its relationship to the degree of
contractual incentives provided by the principal’s interests are discussed. Next, the principal-agent model
is expanded with the incorporation of the previous distribution of school performance in terms of educa-
tional goals. In this context, an analysis of the effects of this signaling mechanism on determining contracts
(incentive design) and the behavior of school managers is conducted.

2.1. A theoretical principal-agent model

The public administrator is responsible for all schools in a given region. Its utility function up is repre-

sented by:

up = k(e(δ)) − cp(e(δ)),

(1)

where k(.) is a function which represents a technology to produce political capital3; cp(.) is a cost function
in monitoring agent activities under asymmetric information; e(.) is an effort function of agent, which
directly depends on contract price δ ≥ 0, e(cid:48) > 0.

Equation (1) indicates that the well-being of the principal is the difference between political capital
k(e) and monitoring costs cp(e) and that both functions depend on agent’s managerial effort. We suppose
political capital formation under decreasing marginal productivity, k(cid:48) > 0, k(cid:48)(cid:48) < 0, and increasing marginal
costs of monitoring4, c(cid:48)

We assume that the agent responds to monetary and non-monetary incentives, i.e, his managerial effort
yields “social reputation” to the principal, k, and it is paid at δ > 0, a contract price which means an
award for productivity5 (Dixit, 2002, Edmans et al., 2009). However, the agent’s effort in school generates
an opportunity cost because it implies less time devoted to leisure or other activities that provide greater
private beneﬁt. The agent’s utility function ua is determined by the net beneﬁt of his/her efforts:

p > 0.

ua = w + δk(e) − ca(e),

(2)

where w is ﬁxed remuneration on public sector; ca(.) is the agent’s cost of opportunity (disutility of time
spent at work) which is increasing in effort (c(cid:48)

a > 0, ca(0) > 0).

2In this study, the effort of a school manager is understood as any proactive action that is aligned with the improvement of

3This function yields a non-monetary compensation – political capital accumulated by the principal. It is expressed, for
example, by issues tied to reputation and political prestige in the community (voters), which is a vital factor for remaining in
elective public ofﬁces.

4To avoid a corner solution, we also assume a ﬁxed cost of monitoring cp(0) > 0.
5By simplicity, whether δ is a monetary incentive, we suppose that it generates a low marginal impact on the government

school results.

budget.

The solution of the principal-agent model (1)-(2), in a case in which there is an incentive design for
the agent (δ > 0), requires that the principal choose a reward for productivity considering the agent’s
preferences. Therefore, the ﬁrst order condition for agent’s optimal effort e∗ under any incentive contract
δ > 0 is given by maximizing the utility function (2):
δk(cid:48)(e∗) = c(cid:48)

(3)

a(e∗).

Equation (3) shows that optimal agent’s effort is reached by equality between marginals beneﬁt and

cost.

The ﬁrst order condition for principal’s optimal contract price δ∗ determination yields:

(δ∗) =

dk
de

(δ∗).

dcp
de

(4)

According to Equation (4), the optimal contract requires that marginal beneﬁt of agent’s effort be equal

to marginal cost of monitoring.

In order to discuss explicit solutions for the problem above, we assume the following speciﬁcation for

political capital production:

k(e) = s0 + e − (e − e)2.

(5)
where s0 ≥ 0 is the initial stock of the principal’s “social reputation”; e ∈ [0, e] is the degree of the agent’s
managerial effort and e > 0 is the maximum effort supported by the agent6.
In the case of minimal effort on the part of the agent (e = 0), the political capital of the principal would
be reduced by s0 − e2, whereas for maximum effort e, the accumulation of maximum capital would be
given by k(e) = s0 + e, according to Equation (5). Furthermore, it is assumed that the process of political
capital formation is not linear and is subject to diminishing marginal productivity. For example, an increase
in the managerial effort of an agent who initially has low productivity is valuable to society, which quickly
assimilates this change in behavior and transfers it in the form of a higher reputation for the principal. With
respect to a very skilled agent, an increase in effort is also transferred to society in gains of political capital
but at a relatively lower rate7.

To keep the simplicity, we also assume the case where both costs functions are linear. Thus, the princi-

pal’s monitoring cost and the agent’s opportunity cost are respectively given by:

cp(e) = α0 + αe,

ca(e) = θ0 + θe,

(6)

(7)

where α e θ represent marginal costs, while α0 > 0 and θ0 > 0 are ﬁxed costs.
In a case in which there is no contract (explicit or implicit) between the principal and the agent (δ = 0),
the agent’s optimal managerial effort is the minimum value e∗ = 0, and the “initial reputation” of the
principal is reduced by e2. Therefore, in the absence of signaling mechanisms, the agent maintains a position
of evading his/her responsibilities to improve the teaching and learning process of the school environment
(moral hazard).

On the other hand, using the condition (4) is straightforward to show that agent’s effort function for any

contract price δ > 0 is written as:

e∗(δ) =

1

1 − θ

7Note that k(cid:48)(e) = 1 − 2(e − e) > 0 ∀ e ≤ e; k(cid:48)(cid:48)(e) = −2 < 0 ∀ e ∈ [0, e].

Equation (8) shows that managerial effort8 has a direct relationship with the parameter of incentives
δ > 0 and an inverse relationship with the agent’s marginal opportunity cost e(cid:48)
e(cid:48)
θ < 0. However, the agent’s
effective behavior is conditioned at the choice of an optimal contract for the principal, as stated in the
following theorem.
Theorem 1. (Optimal contract) Let e∗ be the agent’s optimal level of effort. Then, the optimal contract (δ∗)
agreed upon by the principal and the agent that maximizes the utility of the former is established by the
ratio of the monitoring cost and the opportunity cost of the school manager:

δ∗ =

θ
α

.

(9)

Theorem 1 reveals that the optimal choice of contract depends on the ratio of marginal costs between
the agent and the principal. For example, if the marginal cost of monitoring the agent α is high, then there
will be little beneﬁt for the principal to reward the agent’s productivity. If the agent has a high marginal
opportunity cost for effort at school θ, then she/he should be compensated with more incentives.

2.2. Asymmetric information and managerial effort

The main consequence of Theorem 1 is a negative relationship between asymmetric information degree

and school manager effort. The corollary below summarizes this result.
Corollary 2. (Asymmetric information and managerial effort) Given the optimal contract δ∗, the agent’s
managerial effort is negatively related to the principal’s marginal cost in monitoring school management:

e∗(α) =

1
2

[1 − α] + e.

(10)

Corollary 2 suggests that the value α is decisive in the incentive design and the agent’s managerial ef-
fort9. Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that α is, on one hand, directly related to the asymmetric
information between the principal and the agent and, on the other hand, negatively associated with the de-
gree of the principal’s commitment to the public administration of education. First, the lower the access to
information on the agent’s activities is, the greater the time/effort that the principal must use in monitoring
the agent with regard to contractual rules (educational guidelines). Second, a principal who is very com-
mitted to educational management may have a low marginal valuation of time spent on other activities that
generate private proﬁt and thus can better address monitoring costs.

By contrast, any structural changes involving major assignments for the public administrator (princi-
pal) and/or centralization of school management10 can also increase the marginal cost of monitoring the
education system and therefore produce lower agent productivity.

2.3. Incentive design and managerial effort

According to Cahuc and Zylberberg (2004), the principal in most circumstances can reduce the informa-
tion asymmetry evaluating the accuracy, speed of response and quality of the tasks performed by the agent.
In educational area, information asymmetry problems can be managed based on the analysis of previous
indicators of school performance on standardized tests. In this case, the rulers has outdated information on
the performance of schools in the achievement of educational goals and may discriminate between incen-
tives according to the initial distribution of the degree of effectiveness in meeting the learning goals at the
school.

8Two corner solution are possible. The ﬁrst e∗ = e requires δ = θ and the second e∗ = 0 is related to δ = θ

1+2e. Therefore,

a necessary condition to an interior solution is

θ

1+2e < δ < θ.

9To ensure that the solution is interior, it is necessary that: 1 < α < 1 + 2e.
10Centralized management would tend to raise the monitoring costs in situations that allow “professional” relationships be-
tween the principal and the agent. In the case of non-professional proximity, decentralization does not necessarily imply lower
monitoring costs because this closeness could hinder the degree of recovery, even resulting in possible moral hazard problems.

5

Consider an extension of the principal-agent model (1)-(3) with a goal system (signaling mechanism)
established by an external regulatory agency. If this agency sets a goal for educational outcomes γ, then
the principal knows the initial distribution of the degree of agent’s effectiveness in achieving this goal γ0.
Therefore, two scenarios must be accounted for: (a) ineffective agent, if γ0 < γ; and (b) effective agent, if
γ0 ≥ γ.

In this goal system, the principal’s political formation also depends on interaction between current
agent’s effort and its previous performance in terms of the distance from the established target γ. Thus, we
assume γ0 (cid:54)= γ and rewrite Equation (5) as:

k(e) = s0 + [1 + (γ0 − γ)] e + (e − e)2.

On the other hand, it is possible that marginal cost of monitoring agent’s behavior set according to
previous information about γ0. To make it tractable, we suppose that principal’s cost in monitoring agent’s
is given by:

cp(e) = α0 + [α + (γ0 − γ)] e.

(11)

(12)

As shown in Equation (12), a goal system allows some knowledge about previous agent’s performance
and it affects the strength of asymmetric information. Then, monitoring one more unit of ineffective agent’s
effort costs α +|γ0 − γ| to government, while getting additional information about the behavior of effective
agent requires α − |γ0 − γ| at margin11. Moreover, using Theorem (1) is possible to demonstrate that
s, where δ∗ is
optimal contract price is relatively high in the case of previous effectiveness, i.e, δ∗
the optimal contract price without a goal system (γ0 = γ), s and f are used to index the information about
agent’s effectiveness and ineffectiveness, respectively.
Considering two possible regime equilibrium (δ∗

s) – one for each scenario –, it can be
demonstrated not only that agent’s effort change, but also that marginal effort is decreasing when a previous
ineffective agent becomes effective on reaching system goals. This occurs because agent’s effort function
is non-linear (concave) on contract price as summarized by the corollary below.
Corollary 3. (Signaling, optimal contract and managerial effort) Given different optimal contracts δ∗
f , δ∗
s,
which are established according to the degree of effectiveness of each agent in meeting goals (γ0 − γ),
the marginal effort of agents with low initial effectiveness in response to an increase in incentives will be
greater than that of agents with higher effectiveness in educational outcomes:

f < δ∗ < δ∗

(13)

In general, Corollary 3 indicates that if the initial distribution of educational outcomes enables the sig-
naling of contractual amounts conditioned on monitoring costs, then any contractual stimuli should produce
relatively higher marginal efforts for school managers with low commitment to their management activities.

3. Empirical strategy

In this section, the empirical strategy of the present study is presented to test the main results of the
theoretical model developed. First, the methodology used in calculating the Index of Managerial Effort
(IME), which represents a proxy for the agent’s level of effort, is described. Next, observations are made
regarding the econometric model.

3.1. Item Response Theory and the Index of Managerial Effort

Item Response Theory (IRT) is part of the framework of psychometrics, which enables an identiﬁcation
of the underlying properties of individuals’ responses on tests, quizzes, and other similar instruments that

measure skills, attitudes, and other unobservable (or latent) characteristics, as highlighted by Baker (2001)
and van der Linden and Hambleton (2010).

In this approach, the probability of an individual correctly answering a given item is directly proportional
to latent capacity (Θ), using a logistic function to model the relationship. When considering a dichotomous
response item, the Item Characteristic Curve (ICC) depends on 2 parameters: a parameter for difﬁculty (d),
which determines the position of the ICC; and a parameter for discrimination (a), which indicates the slope
of the ICC. Thus, the ICC can be estimated using the Maximum Likelihood method (ML):

Pr(Uij = 1|Θi) =

1

1 + exp[−aj(Θi − dj)]

,

(14)

where Pr(Uij = 1|Θi) is the probability of individual i’s correctly answering j-th item, conditioning the
value on latent trait i, Θi; aj is the discrimination parameter of item j; dj is the difﬁculty parameter of item
j, deﬁned by the point on the ability scale where the probability of success is 50% with d ∈ (−∞, +∞); Θi
is the ability level of the individual examined, with Θi ∈ (−∞, +∞); and Uij is the response of individual
i for item j, with Uij = 1 if the response is correct, Uij = 0 if not.

In a case in which aj = 1 in Equation (12), the ﬂatter the ICC is, the lower the power of item discrimina-
tion between individuals with low and high ability. Regarding the position of the ICC, an item with greater
difﬁculty (dj) requires a higher level of the latent trait, meaning that the individual has at least a 50% chance
of success in the response.

As some characteristics of the evaluated items may involve ordered polychotomous responses, we adopt
an extension of the IRT model, such as the Generalized Partial Credit Model (GPCM) of Muraki (1992) and
Muraki (1993), which generalizes the model represented by Equation (14). In this case, the expression of
the GPCM that adjusts the ICC is deﬁned by Equation (15), which shows the probability of an individual’s
answering k-th category of the mj categories available for item j. The estimation process of the parameters
is also performed by ML.

Prjk(Uij = k|Θi) =

,

(15)

exp[(cid:80)k
(cid:80)mj
c=1[exp(cid:80)c

v=1 aj(Θi − djv)]

v=1 aj(Θi − djv)]

where dj1 is deﬁned arbitrarily, assuming the value of 0. When the choices are dichotomous (mj = 2), the
GPCM reduces the IRT model for the case of dichotomous answers.

The estimation of the parameters of the items consists of a calibration process for IRT. Among the differ-
ent calibration techniques, the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm is used, suitable for complex ML
problems because it enables the estimation of parameters for items, η, iteratively in the case of unobserved
random variables, Θi (Andrade et al., 2000). By calibrating parameters a and d for each item j, the estimate
of Θi can be performed using the Bayesian method known as the Expected a Posteriori (EAP) estimator or
the Posterior mean estimate. The Bayesian estimate for Θi is basically composed of the deﬁnition of distri-
butions a priori for the parameters of interest, the construction of the new a posteriori distribution, and the
estimate of Θi based on the characteristics of the a posteriori distribution (van der Linden and Hambleton,
2010).

Using the responses of school managers and teachers on issues involving the managers’ proactive be-
havior, incentive practices, and teachers’ awareness of management practices and management actions, this
research uses the value of Θi as a proxy for the IME. In the database section, the items considered are further
detailed. Moreover, in order to simplify the interpretation, we normalize the IME to range from 0 to 100%
max(Θ)−min(Θ) ×100, where minimum and maximum values represent
by the following expression: IM E = Θ−min(Θ)
the theoretical results of latent skills. IME is equals to 100% means that the agent is at the maximum level
of managerial effort among the evaluated items, while IM E = 0 represents the minimum effort.

3.2. Econometric Model

We propose an empirical model which is a stochastic counterpart of Equation (8) under two different
regimes according to previous school performance in achieving educational system goals (Corollary 3).

7

Thus, controlling IME variation for school manager attributes, locational and institutional factors, we in-
vestigate the presence of non-linearity in managerial effort function, i.e, if school managers change their
marginal productivity after reaching educational system goal. Accordingly, consider the following model:

IM Ei,τ = α1,τ E(t−1)i + α2,τ [E(t−1)i − 1] × [D = 1|E(t−1)i ≥ 1] + Xϕτ + ξi,τ ,

(16)
where IM Ei,τ ∈ [0, 100%] is the Index of Managerial Effort of the i-th school manager in quantile τ ∈
[0, 1]; Et−1 ∈ [0, +∞] is the previous rate of effectiveness in terms of achieving a goal in education, whose
goal is normalized to 1; D is a binary variable that receives the value of 1 if the managed school has achieved
the goal in the previous period and has a value equal to 0 if not; X is a matrix that incorporates variables
regarding the manager’s attributes (gender, education, and experience), which are related to maximum
effort supported by manager; school environment, such as socioeconomic status of students, proportion of
temporary teachers, infrastructure, school size, school system, the appointment to the position of school
manager and location factors (regional variables and area of location)12; α1,τ and α2,τ are parameters; ϕτ is
a vector of parameters; and ξi,τ a random error term.

According to the result shown in Corollary 3 of subsection 2.3, it is expected that there is a non-linear
function of effort around the goal for educational results α1,τ > 0 and α2,τ < 0, that is, managers whose
schools were ineffective in fulﬁlling the IDEB13 goal in period t − 1 should have a steeper effort function
than effective managers. In other words, the use of prior information on school performance can induce
different incentives for effective and ineffective schools and ultimately produce different results based on
changes in incentives, in particular regarding the marginal productivity of school managers.

In Brazil, the IDEB – created in 2007 by the Anísio Teixeira National Institute of Educational Studies
and Research (Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira - INEP) – is consid-
ered an indicator of educational quality that links student’s academic progress and performance averages
in mathematics and in Portuguese language on standardized tests. With this indicator, INEP traces educa-
tional quality goals for education systems (INEP, 2007). Therefore, one can consider the level of school
management effectiveness in terms of educational quality (Et−1) based on the relative distance between the
(t−1)i. Thus,
actual IDEB and the goal IDEB for the school i in a given period: E(t−1)i = Ideb(t−1)i/Idebe
the ineffective schools have Et−1 < 1 and the effective E ≥ 1.

The estimation of Equation (16) was performed by quantile regression (QR), with emphasis on 10th
(inferior), 50th (median), and 90th (superior) quantiles, enabling the veriﬁcation of possible behavioral
changes over the distribution of effort. Moreover, according to Koenker (2005), one of the advantages of
using QR is that it neither assumes that the random error term has a Gaussian distribution nor that it is
homoscedastic.

4. Database and treatment of variables

The data used in the present study for the empirical model refer to public schools (state and local) in
the ﬁrst stage of primary education and come from microdata from the Brazilian Student Evaluation Exam
(Prova Brasil – PB) in 2011 and 2013 and the School Census14 for 2011, available on the website of the
INEP. PB records various types of information on the characteristics of the students ﬁnishing the ﬁnal years
of the 2 phases of elementary school and on teachers, schools and managers, thus allowing research on a
wide range of possible factors related to school performance. In turn, the school census shows a snapshot
of enrollment, teachers, and classes in all public and private schools in Brazil, including infrastructure
characteristics for basic education.

Since 2007, INEP and the Ministry of Education have provided information on the IDEB, including
actual and projected performance, which enables the identiﬁcation of schools that are meeting educational

12A detailed description of the covariates in the model is given in the section on the database and treatments of variables.
13IDEB is the Basic Education Development Index (Índice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica).
14It is noteworthy that the managerial effort of school managers in 2011 is related to the school’s math score in the PB in the

years 2011 and 2013 at the end of the results section.

quality goals. In this scenario, the effectiveness level of school management in terms of meeting IDEB
goals, despite the delay in disclosure, is an instrument of control and a signaling mechanism for the public
administration in the regulation and recovery of the commitment of public school managers, mainly for
ineffective schools.

4.1. Calculation of Indices for Managerial Effort, Socioeconomic Level of Students, and School Infrastruc-

ture
We compute an indicator for the school manager effort (IME) with the application of IRT to 2 sets of
data on the managerial characteristics of the school manager collected in the questionnaires from PB in
2011: (a) questions answered by the manager him/herself and (b) questions answered by school teachers.
These questions address actions to improve the updating process, teaching, and learning in schools, and they
also capture the perception of teachers regarding the school manager’s performance (Ballou and Podgursky,
1995). Out of 212 questions in the questionnaire for the school manager in PB, 19 questions related to the
proactive attitude of the school’s management, which were converted into 16 items15. In turn, the teacher
questionnaire, in the 2011 PB, consists of 152 questions (teacher proﬁle, training, perceptions of school
functioning, violence, teaching practices, etc.), 9 of which speciﬁcally address teachers’ opinions on the
managerial performance of the school manager.

To combine the information on managerial actions according to answers from the school managers and
teachers, the school managers’ IME was computed using Equation 17. The calculation of the IME, using
the average of ˆΘ1 and ˆΘ2, aims to compute the manager’s effort with less bias.

where IM Ei ∈ [0; 100%] is the total Index of the Managerial Effort of the i-th school manager; ˆΘ1i is the
Index of Managerial Effort according to the items directed to the i-th school manager; ˆΘ2ij is the Index of
Managerial Effort according to the perception of the j-th teacher regarding of the i-th school manager; and
J is the total number of teachers interviewed at the school i. The school managers with the highest level of
IME have greater proactive practices, with 0 is minimum effort and 100% represents maximum effort.

It is important to note that both ˆΘ1i and ˆΘ2ij were calculated using IRT, considering the EAP estimator
for respective samples of 55,063 school managers and 226,098 teachers with at least 50% valid responses
for the items considered16.

Table 1 stands for the 16 items selected for the school manager and employees in the calculation of
Θ1i, in addition to the scale of responses, the numbers of questions in the manager questionnaire of PB,
the relative frequency of responses to the choices available in each of the items, and the parameters of
discrimination (a) and difﬁculty (d) of each item estimated by IRT.

15Of the 24 questions related to actions of managerial effort, a total of 79% of these questions was used, considering that the
others address, for example, detailing the composition of the school board and programs that depend on conditions of school
demand (such as student admissions criteria).

16In the case of estimates Θ1i and parameters of the ICC, a sample of 55,063 school managers, equivalent to 97.9% of
managers surveyed in PB in 2011, was considered. The sample selected for teachers (226,098) corresponds to 74.3% of the
teachers questioned in the same survey. It is important to emphasize that to better calibrate the parameters of the IRT model and
discriminate latent abilities in the questionnaire responses, the number of observations used includes a greater number of public
schools than that used in the ﬁnal sample of the research. This strategy is consistent with the ML model used to calculate the
parameters of interest.

Source: Test Brazil (Prova Brasil)/Inep 2011. Prepared by authors. For dichotomous items, with scale 0-1, it is assumed the value 1 for answers yes and 0 otherwise.
Note: *It refers to the number of questions in the original questionnaire of school managers in Test Brazil.

As highlighted in the data, most of the items are dichotomous, with 1/4 having more than 2 ordinal
choices, and there is a higher concentration of responses in the choices of the items with a positive direction.
However, only in 4 items is the relative frequency of responses greater than 90%. With regard to the
parameters estimated by IRT, it is noted that items that have greater power to discriminate between low
and high latent ability of managers are, respectively, the variables related to the promotion of programs to
reduce disapproval (a = 2.64), reduce school dropout (a = 1.68) and support learning (a = 1.61). These
items are relatively more important in the calculation of Θ1i. By contrast, questions on the criteria for
assigning classes to teachers, the guidelines to prevent student absences where parents are called to speak at
meetings, and participation in continuing education have the lowest values for the discrimination parameter
in the ICC.

The difﬁculty of the item is another important parameter in calculating Θ1i. Thus, the managers’ actions
in guiding staff to reduce student absences (speciﬁcally items 12 and 15) and the choice on participatory
development of the education program are the issues that require a higher level of managerial effort for a
positive response, with a probability of at least 50%. In the case of item 5 for the choice of scale 4, for
example, a latent ability of 3.48 is the minimum amount required for a response with a high chance of
success for a manager who adopts this type of action in school. Meanwhile, for this same item for the
choice of scale 3, the required skill level would be lower, given that d = −2.46, indicating a lower degree
of difﬁculty for the response.

Table 2 reports the 9 items in the teacher questionnaire from PB that were used to estimate Θ2ij. The
selected questions attempt to capture the perceptions of teachers regarding the managers practices. The data
presented refer to the description of the items, scale, question number in the teacher questionnaire in PB,
the percentage of answers to the options available in each of the items, and the parameters of discrimination

10

(a) and difﬁculty (d). In this case, the scale of all items considered is a Likert scale, in which teachers give
their opinions on the administrative characteristics of school manager according to the following options: 0
– completely disagree, 1 – disagree, 2 – indifferent, 3 – agree, and 4 – completely agree.

Based on the responses, there is a tendency for teachers to evaluate the managers with the most favorable
scales (3 and 4) due to the higher percentage of responses attributed to partial and full agreement with the
managerial attitudes. Accordingly, items that have greater power to discriminate between managers with
low and high latent ability from the perspective of teachers are, respectively: trust in the school manager
as a professional (a = 4.24), managerial attitudes that give special attention to student learning (a = 3.80)
and encourage innovative activities (a = 3.55). In comparison, items 9, 7, and 6 show lower power of
discrimination. According to the parameter of difﬁculty, the options of scale 3 and scale 4 of item 2 require
the highest value of latent ability, whereas the options of scale 0 of all 0 items requires the lowest latent
ability (d = 0).

It is noteworthy that the explanatory variables related to the socioeconomic status of students (SSS)
and the school infrastructure indicator (SII) were also calculated for IRT. To calculate the SII, a model was
used with 2 parameters with dichotomous responses from a set of 52,488 schools with at least 50% valid
responses, whereas, for the SSS, GPCM was used with a sample of 1,974,016 students, in which the SSS of
the school is deﬁned by the average of the students’ SSS. The items that compose these indicators is based
on other studies applied to Brazil, such as Soares and Andrade (2006) and Alves and Soares (2012) for the
case of socioeconomic status and Soares-Neto et al. (2013) for school infrastructure.

4.2. Sample Selection and Descriptive Statistics

In accordance with the objective of this study, we made a series of cuts from the main sample. Of
the total of 56,222 federal, state, and municipal schools in the sample of PB from 2011, only state and
municipal schools were considered with grades in PB from 2011 and 2013 for students from the 5th year of
primary school, with IME, SII, and SSS estimated for 2011 and with no missing observations in the set of
selected variables. After these ﬁlters, the ﬁnal sample was composed of 23,887 state and municipal schools.
Based on Ballou and Podgursky (1995), we select a set of variables for empirical analysis. They can be

grouped into the following dimensions:

Note: *It refers to the question order in the original questionnaire of teachers in Test Brazil.

• Signaling mechanisms - the level of school effectiveness in fulﬁlling the IDEB goal in 2009 (E),
deﬁned by the ratio of the IDEB goal for the school and the actual IDEB (this variable is determined
by INEP);

• School Context – the school size (total enrollment by 1,000, according to data from the School Census
of 2011); a binary variable for the school system (state or municipal); a dummy variable for the
manager position (occupied by appointment or other criteria); the school size squared; the average
socioeconomic status of students (SSS), the school infrastructure index (SII); a percentage indicator of

12

temporary teachers (a binary variable that has a value of 1 if the school has more than 50% ineffective
teachers and 0 if not);

• Manager’s attributes - gender (a binary variable that is 1 if the manager is male and 0 if female);
higher education (a dummy equal to 1 if the manager has higher education and 0 if not); and time
working for the school (a set of 8 dummy variables with a value of 1 according to the manager’s
experience and 0 if not);

• Location factors - binary variables for location, referring to sector (a binary variable that has a value
of 1 if the school is in urban areas and 0 if located in the countryside), and for states, including the
Federal District (a set of dummy variables with a value of 1 based on the federal unit where the school
is located and 0 if not).

Figure 1 presents the estimates of probability densities for the IME, SII, and SSS indicators obtained by

IRT. The descriptive statistics of the selected variables are presented in Table 3 below.

Figure 1: Probability densities for selected indicators

(a) IME

(b) SSS

(c) SII

Source: Prepared by authors.
Note: Density estimates using the Kernel function with Gaussian core. The following optimal parameters were used for smooth-
ing the densities of the IME: 1.423 - Total IME; 1.788 for IME - based on the school manager survey; and 1.941 for IME - based
on the teacher survey. Regarding the densities of SSS and SII, the following values were adopted: 0.4171 and 1.883, respectively.

Figure 1a shows that the distributions of the variables of the IME based on the information provided
by the school manager (IME - Manager) and the IME of the manager based on the teachers’ perceptions
(IME - Teachers) record different characteristics. While IME - Manager has an asymmetric distribution to
the left, IME - Teachers has a bimodal distribution. In the ﬁrst case, there is a high concentration of the
probability of managers who report productive practices. In the second, there is a group of teachers who
report that the manager’s effort is below average and another group that reports above average management
practices. However, when considering the distribution of the total IME (see Equation (17), the distribution
presents symmetry/unimodality, that is, the distribution becomes not biased after weighting the information
provided by the managers themselves and the teachers.

With respect to the distribution of the SSS, one can see a symmetrical format around the mean (-0.01);
see Figure 1b. Figure 1c shows that the SII distribution is bimodal, i.e., there is a group of schools with
infrastructure conditions below the central value (median) and another group of schools with good infras-
tructure conditions (mode higher than the median).

According to the descriptive statistics reported in Table 3, most managers are women (86.3%), have
higher education (95.4%), and have between 2 and 5 years of experience in school management (33.6%);
54% of them took the position through a technical or policy appointment. On average, schools have 636
students enrolled, with the majority being male (51%). By contrast, 72.7% of schools are part of the
municipal school, 78.8% record that more than half of the teaching staff is composed of non-temporary
workers, and 98.9% are located in urban areas, especially in the states of São Paulo (16.3%), Minas Gerais
(12.7%), and Rio de Janeiro (7.1%).

In terms of proﬁciency, the math average scores among schools in 2011 and in 2013 were 208.9 and

14

210.1 points on the SAEB scale17, respectively. Additionally, the average value of the effectiveness index
in 2009 (1.10) shows that the typical school in the selected sample exceeded the goal for the IDEB.

The proportion of students who work is 13.4%, while the age-grade discrepancy indicator (0.86) shows

that, on average, the typical student is behind the grade suitable for his/her age.

5. Results

Table 4 presents the results of estimates from the function of managerial effort of public school managers
(see Equation 16). Four regressions were performed: one regression using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
and 3 quantile regressions using ML for the quantiles 0.50 (median), 0.10 (lower quantile), and 0.90 (higher
quantile). This strategy allows us to evaluate how the determinants of the agents’ managerial effort behave
in different parts of the distribution of effort and to ensure greater ﬂexibility in the stochastic distribution of
this variable (Koenker, 2005).

Before driving the analysis for the main question in this empirical part (the test about corollary 3), we
will make a brief discussion of the control variables and manager’s attributes. The results of Table 4 are
also highly suggestive with regard to possible differences in the productivity of managers according to the
degree of centralization/decentralization of the public management of education. It is worth noting that
the estimated coefﬁcients for the variables “municipal school” and “appointed position” are negative and
statistically signiﬁcant at 1% in all regressions.

More speciﬁcally, the ﬁndings suggest that managers in municipal schools (decentralized management)
have a lower IME compared to managers in state schools (centralized management – omitted category).
This result indicates that the decentralization theorem18, as highlighted by Oates (1972), does not gener-
ate incentives for increased managerial effort in Brazilian public schools. A possible explanation for this
evidence is the presence of moral hazard generated by greater proximity between the rulers and munic-
ipal school managers in small towns19 or higher information costs than centralized case, which may not
stimulate incentive mechanisms for productivity. According to Prud’homme (1995), the beneﬁts of decen-
tralization in allocative efﬁciency are not as obvious as indicated by decentralization theorem, in which
there may be some practical dangers: low administrative and technical capacity, lack of transparency and
modern management processes etc.

When technically or politically appointed managers are compared with managers who received this
position by other means (election, for example), the results show that there is less managerial effort in
the group of appointed managers. Considering Tucker and Codding (2002) and Dixit (2002) about theory
of incentives, the manager’s appointment position can increase the marginal cost of monitoring, because
the collection channels by principal are more politically costly, which may imply a lower result of agent’s
efforts. Thus, based on empirical results, schools with managers appointed by rulers tend to practice less
effort, given a higher cost of the ruler to require a greater commitment.

The size of the school, measured by quantitative enrollment, is an indicator of the scale of operation of
supplying educational services, meaning that school units of different sizes can have different contexts for
the manager’s performance. These ﬁndings initially indicate a non-linear (U-shaped) relationship between
school size and the manager’s effort in the models considered, except for the estimated coefﬁcients for the
0.10 quantile. In the case of the models conditioned for the mean, median, and 0.90 quantile, the inﬂection
point is 3,200, 2,700 and 2,300 enrolled students, respectively. Thus, for increments of students in school
units with enrollments below these numbers, the relationship between school size and the IME is negative.

17National Basic Education Assessment System (Sistema de Avaliação da Educação Básica – SAEB) scale is com-
posed by intervals of PB proﬁciency levels which aims to identify the student’s cognitive skills. For more details, see
http://provabrasil.inep.gov.br/escalas-da-prova-brasil-e-saeb.

18The decentralization theorem of Oates (1972) notes that the provision of public services tends to be more efﬁcient when it is

performed in a decentralized manner, given the better identiﬁcation of local preferences.

19In Brazil, according to the Population Census of 2010, approximately 90% of Brazilian municipalities have up to 50,000
inhabitants, and more than 70% have 20,000 or fewer inhabitants, which suggests a large number of municipalities with small
populations.

By contrast, in schools with enrollments above these thresholds, there is a positive relationship. How-
ever, given the small amount of public schools with over 2,300 enrolled students (corresponding to only
0.4% of the total number of public schools in the sample), the relationship between school size and the IME
is mainly negative. Therefore, in general, larger schools and thus schools with a more complex organization
tend to increase the opportunity cost of the manager’s effort. This result is not observed for the locus of the
conditional distribution of the IME for the less hardworking managers (0.10 quantile), indicating that the
efforts made by these individuals do not depend on the range of educational services offered.

Additionally, with regard to the school context, the empirical results show that managers in public
schools with better infrastructure conditions put forward more effort in terms of management practices, sug-
gesting the importance of the complementarity between physical capital and human capital.Furthermore,

16

this result indicates that, in schools with poor infrastructure, the managers feel less encouraged to apply
more managerial effort. By contrast, in schools where there are students with higher socioeconomic sta-
tus, there also seems to be more managerial effort from the managers, possibly due to the greater weight
of family participation in schools, which contributes to forcing more proactive behavior from the school
manager.

The ﬁndings also show interesting aspects in the relationship between the IME and the personal at-
tributes (gender, education, and experience). In all regressions presented in Table 4, there is evidence that
male managers show relatively less effort than female managers (base category) and that managers with
a Superior educational level record greater managerial effort compared to those with a lower education
(omitted category). Moreover, it is observed that in general, managers with more time working in school
management have increased efforts in management practices compared with inexperienced managers (less
than 1 year of work at the school – the reference category).

The signaling system of efforts through educational goals for each school seems to be insufﬁcient in
eliminating the behavioral changes of public school manager (moral hazard).
In this sense, the results
for the variable [E(t−1)i − 1] × [D = 1|E(t−1)i ≥ 1] suggest that there is a nonlinear (concave) response
of the agents’ managerial effort in terms of the school’s position with respect to the IDEB goal in the
previous period. That is, school managers who were ineffective in achieving the projected IDEB in the
previous period record marginal productivity/effort in response to higher incentives compared to agents
whose schools were effective, supporting the theoretical approach of the present study (see Corollary 3).
Figure 2 reports that this result does not show much heterogeneity over the conditional distribution of the
IME, including the most extreme quantile.

With regard to the evidence noted above, the ﬁndings are fairly regular, especially when the coefﬁcients
estimated by OLS and quantile regressions are collated (Figure 2 reinforces this result). For example, the
quantile regression for the median, the coefﬁcient associated with the variable “Effectiveness in 2009”, is
positive and statistically signiﬁcant at 1%, whereas the estimated coefﬁcient for the iterated variable, slope
change, (E − 1) × (D = 1|E ≥ 1) is negative and also signiﬁcant at 1%. It is also possible to observe
similar results for the estimates produced by OLS and quantile regression in the lower and upper parts of
the distribution of the IME.

Thus, the results suggest that if a typical manager of an ineffective public school receives an incentive
to closely approach the projected academic achievement, then this condition would lead to an additional
effort that is higher than that observed for a manager whose school has already met the goal proposed
by the government. These behavioral differences between groups of managers conditioned on the initial
distribution of the degree of effectiveness/ineffectiveness can be explained by the existence of moral hazard
in the relationship between school managers and rulers.

6. Final Remarks

The theoretical principal-agent model presented in this article suggests that a public school manager may
respond with more managerial effort in the face of a better incentive structure. However, the parameters of
the contractual design between a ruler and manager, in line with the interests of the ruler, depend on the
ratio of the manager’s marginal opportunity cost and the principal’s marginal cost of monitoring the agent’s
effort.

Under optimal contract arrangements, the agent’s managerial effort has an inverse relationship with the
marginal cost of monitoring. This result is expanded for the case in which there is a system of educational
performance goals and the schools’ distribution is known and acts as a signaling mechanism in the principal-
agent relationship. Thus, under the assumption of the same opportunity cost for agents, it is shown that the
principal should apply incentives that are directly related to their previous performance (due to different
monitoring costs) and, in this case, the function of the managerial effort becomes nonlinear around the
school’s goal.

The empirical ﬁndings showed that political or technical appointment to the post of school management
is a practice that reduce agents’ managerial effort. In line with the developed theoretical approach, this
study found that through improvements in contractual incentives, ineffective school managers can increase
their effort more sharply than those who are active in effective schools. This evidence characterizes the
presence of moral hazard, despite the signaling mechanism using goals for quality educational levels. Thus,
there seems to be a need for contractual designs that establish criteria for awards/punishment conditioned
on the distribution of educational outcomes.

Based on the theoretical propositions and the empirical evidence, educational policies in Brazil should
pay special attention to the managerial aspects of school units. In this study, the prominent role of school
managers in developing organizational structures to support teaching and learning can be observed in the
positive correlation between the level of proﬁciency in the school’s mathematics and the IME, particularly
in schools with the worst levels of proﬁciency. Therefore, it is extremely important to adapt the existing
signaling mechanisms – ﬂuid educational goals instead of goals designed by information at the starting
point on proﬁciency level and a shorter delay in data collection on educational performance, among other
things – or to create new mechanisms that act to reduce problems such as moral hazard.

Taking into account the relevance of the issue presented in this study, future research may propose a
dynamic extension of the theoretical model to assess the trajectories of managerial effort over time and/or
to evaluate the behavior of individuals in the face of a sequential game. Empirically, further studies on
this issue may advance the use of variables that best capture, for example, monitoring costs and test the
moral hazard hypothesis with longitudinal data on school managers and verify the effects of the IME on the
performance of students using, for example, multilevel models.
