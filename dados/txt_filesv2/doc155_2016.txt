From Rivers to Roads: Spatial Mismatch and Inequality of Opportunity in 

Urban Labor Markets of a Megacity

Abstract.  The  spatial  mismatch  between  residential  locations  and  jobs  can  be  particularly 
relevant for low-skilled individuals. In this paper, we first explore such phenomenon from the 
perspective  of  the  distance  of  the  residence  to  the  geographic  concentration  of  jobs,  and 
locational disadvantages of the urban form itself. Such unequal conditions in the labor market 
present  a  great  challenge  for  the  spatial  sustainability  of  the  multiple  equilibria  achieved 
simultaneously  at  the  labor  and  the  housing  markets.  We  estimate  the  main  aspects  that 
influence wage differentials among individuals, focusing on the role of accessibility on labor 
market outcomes. We suggest the inclusion of geographical characteristics as instruments to 
deal  with  endogeneity  problems  that  arise  in  the  estimation  of  urban  price  models.  Our 
strategy  is  based  on  the  inclusion  of  a  specific  geographic/historic  variable  as  instrument, 
namely the river shore access to the first school built by the Jesuits in São Paulo, the city’s 
founding  location.  Geography  acted  as  a  determinant  of  the  location  of  the  transportation 
infrastructure  in  the  region,  so  that  the  road  and  rail  networks  in  the  city  present  a  strong 
spatial  correlation  with  pre-urban  “waterways”.  Nowadays,  the  vast  majority  of  rivers  and 
creeks are covered with asphalt and cement, and economic agents are practically unaware of 
their existence.

Resumo.  O  descompasso  espacial  entre  locais  residenciais  e  postos  de  trabalho  pode  ser 
particularmente relevante para as pessoas menos qualificadas. Neste artigo, exploramos esse 
fenômeno  a  partir  da  perspectiva  da  distância  da  residência  à  concentração  geográfica  dos 
postos  de  trabalho  e  das  desvantagens  locacionais  inerentes  à  própria  forma  urbana.  Tais 
condições  desiguais  no  mercado  de  trabalho  apresentam  um  grande  desafio  para  a 
sustentabilidade espacial dos múltiplos equilíbrios alcançados simultaneamente nos mercados 
de  trabalho  e  de  habitação.  Estimamos  os  principais  aspectos  que  influenciam  as  diferenças 
salariais entre indivíduos, enfocando o papel da acessibilidade nos resultados do mercado de 
trabalho.  Sugerimos  a  inclusão  de  características  geográficas  como  instrumentos  para  lidar 
com  problemas  de  endogeneidade  que  surgem  na  estimativa  de  modelos  de preços  urbanos. 
Nossa  estratégia  é  baseada  na  inclusão  de  uma  variável  geográfica  /  histórica  como 
instrumento, ou seja, o acesso à primeira escola construída pelos jesuítas em São Paulo, local 
de  fundação  da  cidade  caminhando  pelas  margens  dos  rios.  A  geografia  agiu  como  um 
determinante da localização da infraestrutura de transportes na região, de modo que as redes 
rodoviárias  e  ferroviárias  da  cidade  apresentam  uma  forte  correlação  espacial  com  a  rede 
hídrica. Hoje em dia, a grande maioria dos rios e córregos é coberta por asfalto e cimento, e 
os agentes econômicos praticamente desconhecem a sua existência.

1. Introduction 
 
Location  decisions  of  firms  and  workers  shape  the  spatial  distribution  of  economic 
activity  between  and  within  cities.  On  one  hand,  the  interaction  between  cities  is 
widely  investigated  in  the  literature  of  regional  and  urban  economics,  which  tries  to 
assess  the  extent  to  which  urban  scale  affects  the  local  concentration  of  different 
skills, sectors, etc., apart from defining each city’s role in the regional system. On the 
other  hand,  within-city  dynamics  and  internal  heterogeneity  is  the  focus  of  urban 
labor economic theory, simultaneously analyzing land/housing markets with the labor 
market (Zenou, 2009).  
 
Furthermore, the spatial scale of analysis shapes the choice of tools and measures to 
investigate  specific  issues.  For  instance,  agglomeration  economies  are  usually 
assessed  by  aggregated  measures  such  as  total  population  or  density.  However,  this 
type  of  analysis  does  not  provide  a  complete  understanding  of  the  intra-urban 
distribution  of  agglomeration  economies  effects  (Melo  and  Graham,  2009).  An 
alternative  approach  requires  the  estimation  of market  potential  measures  over  labor 
market  indicators,  with  distance  decaying  effects  varying  over  space.  In  a  way, 
accessibility  to  jobs  embeds  the  concept  of  market  potential  and  a  higher  chance  of 
interactions  and  matching  in  the  job  market.  Thus,  agglomeration  economies  may 
have heterogeneous effects  within cities, affecting location decisions of  workers and 
firms. 
 
In this paper, we look at how economic agents benefit from such interactions within a 
specific urban labor market area. Any equilibrium in the labor market will be directly 
related to the housing market. Therefore, wages and housing prices will alternatively 
be  the  interest  variables,  being  jointly  affected  by,  among  other  characteristics,  the 
accessibility to jobs in the city. 
 
We use the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR), the main economic and financial 
center of Brazil, as our case study. SPMR is the fourth largest urban agglomeration of 
the world, and the largest urban agglomeration in the country, with about 10% of the 
national  population  (around  20  million  inhabitants),  and  responsible  for  19%  of 
Brazilian  GDP.  The  city  of  São  Paulo  is  the  core  of  the  metropolitan  area  and 
accounts for 5.9% of the country’s population  and 12% of its GDP. As we will see, 
the  spatial  mismatch  between  residential  locations  and  jobs  can  be  particularly 
relevant for poorer individuals, who rely more heavily on public transportation. 
 
In  what  follows,  we  explore  the  relationship  between  commuting  time,  accessibility 
and  urban  prices  in  the  context  of  urban  markets  in  a  megacity  in  the  developing 
world.  We  start  by  lining  up  the  theoretical  framework  that  permeates  the  empirical 
analysis. The key point is the simultaneous determination of land use and urban prices 
in the context of the family of spatial general equilibrium urban models we consider. 
That brings challenges for dealing with simultaneity bias in the  empirical estimation 
of  urban  wages  and  housing  prices  models.  We  address  this  issue  by  relying  on  an 
instrumental  variables  estimation  that  uses  the  river  shore  access  to  the  city’s 
founding location as instrument for accessibility to jobs. 
 
2. Theoretical Background

We use as the conceptual framework a spatial general equilibrium model of land use 
with  endogenous  job  locations  in  a  circular  city.  The  model  we  draw  on  was 
developed in Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg (2002) – henceforth, LRH – and represents a 
generalization  of  the  work  by  Fujita  and  Ogawa  (1982).3  The  model  was  further 
extended in Rossi-Hansberg (2004) to look at efficiency properties of land allocation 
in  the  context  of  the  same  conceptual  framework.4  The  theory  determines  the 
distribution of business and residential land together with employment and residential 
densities at all locations in the city, as well as urban prices (i.e. wages and land rents). 
Given  the  general  equilibrium  nature  of  the  theory,  one  should  be  aware  of  the 
potential  simultaneity  bias  in  the  empirical  estimation  of  wage  and  housing  price 
equations based on accessibility measures. 
 
In  this  framework,  productivity  is  higher  the  higher  is  employment  in  neighboring 
locations.  Following  Lucas  (2001),  the  specification  of  the  model  considers  such 
external  effect  of  employment  to  decline  exponentially  with  distance.  This  arbitrary 
form of production externalities will prove to be very useful for our empirical work. 
 
Despite  the  admittedly  very  stylized  nature  of  the  model,  it  can  be  used  as  a 
conceptual  framework  to  understand  the  interaction  of  forces  that  are  important  in 
determining urban structure. As such, it provides the structural background to obtain 
quantitative implications in more detailed empirical studies. 
 
The take-home results from LRH that are relevant for our empirical strategy are: 
 

1.  The  model  simultaneously  determines  the  location  of  jobs  and  workers,  as 

well as wages and land rents. 

2.  In equilibrium, wages within the city increase with employment density. 
3.  In equilibrium, land rents within the city also increase with density of workers. 
4.  As  a  consequence  of  (1)-(3),  accessibility  to  jobs  is  also  simultaneously 

determined, for any given commuting cost function. 

 
We will depart from reduced-form intra-urban prices equations based on accessibility 
to  capture production externalities in the form  proposed in  LHR. Many studies have 
already  considered  accessibility  as  a  key  variable  in  models  for  housing  prices  and 
land  rents.  Duranton  and  Puga  (2015)  have  surveyed  a  well-established  urban 
economics  literature  that  provides  evidence  that  accessibility  determines  land  and 
housing prices in different locations. However, a far less numerous literature provides 
evidence of accessibility determining intra-urban wages. 
 
In  the  case  of  land  and  housing  prices  models,  Duranton  and  Puga  (2015,  p.  471) 
points out that the patterns of accessibility are also affected by the location choices of 
firms and workers, which are determined by prices. Hence, the land use problem is in 
essence a hard equilibrium problem with many feedbacks. The authors also recognize 

                                                 
3  Zenou  (2009)  provides  a  modern  synthesis  of  urban  labor  economic  theory,  which  consolidates 
research that explicitly model both the land/housing market (where both the location of workers and the 
price  of  land/housing  market  are  endogenous)  and  the  labor  market  (where  both  wages  and 
unemployment are endogenous). 
4 The model in Rossi-Hansberg (2004) characterizes the optimal distribution of urban land. It is shown 
that  the  analysis  of  optimal  urban  structure  can  be  used  to  design  optimal  policies  to  improve  the 
efficiency of equilibrium allocations in the same setup.

that the literature first solved it by restricting accessibility to be solely about access to 
jobs  and  by  treating  the  location  of  these  jobs  as  exogenous  within  a  simple 
geography and with frictionless markets. In cities where the majority of jobs are well 
outside the urban core, it is also empirically problematic to equate accessibility to jobs 
(or even general accessibility) to the distance to the city center. In other words, better 
work is needed to reduce uncertainty.  
 
Focusing  on  the  labor  market  outcomes,  we  present  the  research  methodology 
discussing  the  strategy  to  get  rid  of  the  usual  identification  hypothesis  that  restricts 
job locations to the CBD. Our strategy allows dealing with the simultaneity nature of 
business  and  housing  locations  and  urban  prices  determination  in  a  richer 
geographical  setting.  Before  proceeding  to  that,  we  look  at  some  stylized  facts 
concerning the spatial structure of our study region. 
 
3. The Internal Structure of the SPMR – Some Stylized Facts 
 
From  a  stylized  perspective,  a  Muth-Mills-Alonso  urban  model,  having  as  the  CBD 
the  extended  center  of  the  city  of  Sao  Paulo  (Haddad  et  al.,  2015),  may  loosely 
approach  the  internal  organization  of  the  SPMR.  Even  though  the  broadly-defined 
CBD  concentrates  a  great  part  of  the  jobs,  a  considerable  level  of  employment 
decentralization  is  perceived  in  the  region  (Figure  1).  Households  are  spread  across 
the territory, mainly located in the surroundings of the center, with population density 
decay in the boundaries of the territory of the metropolis (Figure 2).

According  to  the  2010  population  census,  the  city  of  São  Paulo  –  the  core  of  the 
SPMR  –  received  daily  an  inflow  of  almost  one  million  commuters,  representing 
15.4%  of  workers  in  the  city.  The  great  majority  of  commuters’  flows  were  from 
peripheral regions in São Paulo and other municipalities to the metropolitan business 
centers in the central and western zones of São Paulo city. 
 
Low-income  residents  are  overwhelmingly  overrepresented  in  the  periphery  (Figure 
3). Considering that commuting patterns also vary across the SPMR, where the share 
of  job  commuting  trips  taken  by  public  transportation  tends  to  be  higher  in  the 
peripheral  areas  (Figure  4),  the  average  commuting  time  for  the  low-income 
population  tends  also  to  be  higher,  diminishing  considerably  their  access  to  job 
opportunities. 
 
One  important  implication  of  the  pattern  of  spatial  distribution  of  workers  and 
residents observed in SPMR, together with the travel demand behavior, is that it will 
make it harder for some workers to access jobs. In particular, the somehow diffuse job 
decentralization  makes  it  more  difficult  for  workers  with  no  car  to  reach  potential 
employers once these are located far from the focal points of accessibility associated 
with  the  public  transportation  infrastructure.  This  spatial  mismatch  makes  it  much 
harder for low-income workers to find employment since they traditionally reside in 
the less central parts of cities and depend heavily on the radial infrastructure of public 
transportation (Figure 5).

4. Research Design 
 
There  is  a  substantial  empirical  literature  concerned  with  variation  of  urban  prices 
within  cities.  The  grand  majority  relies  on  the  identification  hypothesis  that 
employment  is  concentrated  in  the  central  city.  We  revisit  the  usual  empirical 
strategies to estimate the effects of accessibility to jobs on urban prices, attempting to 
address  properly  the  problem  of  simultaneity  bias  that  emerges  from  adopting  the 
conceptual  framework  described  in  Section  2.  Our  goal  is  to  bring  empirical  work 
closer  to  theory.  Adopting  a  rich  geography  setting,  we  want  to  learn  more  about 
fundamentals,  rather  than  looking  at  the  relationship  between  urban  prices  and 
accessibility for its own sake.  
 
The  empirical  strategy  focuses  on  the  labor  market.5  The  model  is  based  on  the 
econometric estimation of a wage equation motivated by urban labor economic theory 
(Zenou,  2009).  To  estimate  the  model,  we  use  micro  data  for  a  large  sample  of 
households  in  the  SPMR  and  their  individual  household  members  with  information 
for their travel behavior. The regression analysis of the wage equation considers as the 
dependent  variable the earnings of each  worker in  the sample. Commuting time and 
an  index  of  accessibility  to  jobs  –  discussed  below  –  are  the  relevant  independent 
variables.  Long  commute  is  expected  to  decrease  workers’  productivity  as  longer 
commuting  time  may  induce  workers  to  arrive  late  at  work,  or  leave  earlier,  and 

                                                 
5  A  complementary  empirical  strategy  would  focus  on  the  housing  markets.  The  estimation  of  a 
hedonic  price  model  (with  the  effects  of  agglomeration  economies  on  housing  prices)  would  be  the 
more pragmatic approach.  One would ideally study the housing market based on repeated sales prices 
from  all  transactions.  However,  such  information  is  not  available  for  Brazilian  markets.  As  a 
suggestion for future studies, one way to deal with this issue would be to use the asking price of new 
residential developments registered by EMBRAESP. This database covers the SPMR since 1985, with 
geocoded  micro  data  at  the  housing  unit  level.  It  is  not  a  statistical  sample,  but  it  covers  all  new 
developments publicly announced in the formal housing market.

increase the number of absent days (Van Ommeren and Gutièrrez-I-Puigarnau, 2009); 
moreover  workers  experiencing  longer  commuting  trips  may  also  become  less 
productive  as  they  provide  lower  effort  levels  than  those  residing  closer  to  jobs 
(Zenou,  2002).  Agglomeration  economies,  captured  by  the  accessibility  index  that 
resembles  a  market  potential  measure,  are  expected  to  positively  influence  workers’ 
earnings. Workers are paid more in larger and denser markets because they are more 
productive there due to the presence of agglomeration economies (Melo and Graham, 
2009).6  
 
The main problem  with  the aforementioned approach is  a strong  theoretical  concern 
that,  since  wages  are  determined  simultaneously  with  accessibility  to  jobs,  the  latter 
will be potentially correlated with the error term, leading to bias and inconsistency in 
OLS  estimation.  In  the  following  discussion,  we  provide  evidence  about  the 
accessibility  effects  on  urban  prices,  attempting  at  tackling  the  fundamental 
simultaneity  problems  that  afflicted  previous  empirical  work  relying  on  the  strong 
identification  hypothesis  of  central  city  jobs.  The  solution  for  this  problem  requires 
finding a suitable instrument for our accessibility measure. 
 
Inspired  by  the  work  by  Duranton  and  Turner  (2011),  our  instrument  should  reflect 
the  suitability  of  SPMR  geography  to  build  the  urban  transportation  infrastructure, 
keeping in mind that it should be uncorrelated with the residuals in our regressions.  
 
Our instrumental variables strategy is based on the inclusion of a geographic/historic 
variable as the instrument for accessibility to jobs, namely the river shore distance to 
the first school built by the Jesuits in São Paulo, the city’s founding location currently 
known  as  Pateo  do  Collegio.7  The  city  has  since  expanded  around  that  location,  as 
can  be  attested  by  historical  maps  (Figure  6).  Today,  São  Paulo’s  official  “ground 
zero” lies a few blocks from there. We construct our instrument from a GIS database 
of the watershed within SPMR (Figure 7). The main task was to calculate the distance 
to the historical site from every observation unit in the database.8  
 
 

 

                                                 
6  Agglomeration  economies  captured  by  the  model  accessibility  index  are  of  the  “matching”  type 
(improved matching of labor and firms, as well as higher probability of matching). 
7  In  1553,  P.  Manuel  da  Nobrega,  after  a  visit  to  the  Inhambussu  plateau  (“the  one  you  see  in  the 
distance”),  decided  to  start  there  a  new  mission  for  the  Society  of  Jesus.  One  year  later,  with  the 
intention to teach and catechize the Indians who lived in the plateau of Piratininga, the Jesuits built the 
first  school  made  of  wattle  and  daub  (construction  technique  with  mud,  bamboo  and  straw).  The 
location  is  currently  known  as  Pateo  do  Collegio  and  it  is  considered  the  founding  site  of  the  city  of 
São Paulo. 
8 To create an “Origin-Destination Cost Matrix” we used the Network Analyst extension from ArcGIS. 
The parameter used to  build the OD Cost Matrix  was route length (in kilometers). We have assumed 
that people could walk in both directions along the bank of the rivers.

The justification for the choice of such instrument follows. Geography has acted as a 
determinant  of  the  location  of  the  transportation  infrastructure  in  the  region,  so  that 
the  road  network  in  the  city  presents  a  strong  spatial  correlation  with  pre-urban 
“waterways”  (natural  design  for  roads).  Nowadays,  the  vast  majority  of  rivers  and 
creeks  are  covered  with  asphalt  and  cement,  and  economic  agents  are  practically 
unaware  of  their  existence.  The  a  priori  case  for  the  exogeneity  of  our  instrument 
seems plausible. 
 
In a historical perspective, in the mid-nineteenth century, the city of São Paulo started 
a more systematic occupation of the floodplains of the main watercourses of the city. 
The  reason  was  associated  with  the  implementation  of  regional  and  urban 
infrastructure  (railways  and  roads).  In  1929,  the  Plano  de  Avenidas  elaborated  by 
Prestes Maia further reinforced the occupancy of the floodplains of rivers, by focusing 
in  the  development  of  large  avenues  in  the  thalwegs.  This  conception  of  the  use  of 
floodplains  as  the  preferential  space  for  circulation  prevailed  in  the  following 
development plans for the city, so that thalwegs avenues represent nowadays the main 
arteries of São Paulo (Travassos and Grostein, 2003; Meyer et al., 2004) (Figure 8).

4.1. Measuring Accessibility to Jobs9 
 
The previous discussion highlighted the importance of instrumenting for accessibility 
to  jobs  in  the  empirical  analysis.  The  accessibility  index  to  be  used  in  this  study  is 
based  on  Hansen’s  formulation  (Hansen,  1959),  which  defines  accessibility  as  the 
potential of opportunities for interaction. It weighs the travel time of each location to 

                                                 
9 This section draws on Vieira and Haddad (2015)

the various job locations in SPMR, in a rich geographical setting. This formulation is 
convenient to introduce the form of production externalities specified in LRH. 
 
According to Du and Mulley (2006), Hansen gravity-based accessibility measures can 
be considered the most robust approach to measure accessibility to a certain service, 
such  as  employment,  since  the  main  advantage  of  this  indicator  is  the  ability  to 
combine the effects  of transport and land use. The limitations are the  following:  the 
calibration of the impedance function and the segregation of the effects of separation 
and  attractiveness.  Nevertheless,  indicators  derived  from  Hansen’s  model  have  been 
widely used for this type of measurement in the literature (Raia, 2000). We show its 
basic formulation below: 
 
𝐴𝑖   =   ∑

        

𝑤𝑗

𝑛
𝑗=1

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
𝑑𝑖𝑗(𝑡)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

        

(1) 
 
According to this formula, the accessibility 𝐴 for each region 𝑖 is given by the sum of 
opportunities 𝑤 available at each region 𝑗, divided by the impedance 𝑑𝑖𝑗(𝑡) to go from 
𝑖 to 𝑗. 
 
We define the opportunities 𝑤𝑗 as the total employment 𝐸 in each region 𝑗. 
 
𝑤𝑗   =   𝐸𝑗 
(2) 
 
The values of 𝐸𝑗 can be extracted from the Origin-Destination (OD) Survey of 2007, 
conducted  by  the  São  Paulo  Metropolitan  Company,  in  which  30,000  households 
were interviewed to collect socioeconomic and commuting data on all residents. Thus, 
regions 𝑖 and 𝑗 are defined according to the 460 zones of the OD survey. 
 
We  define  the  impedance  function  𝑑𝑖𝑗(𝑡)  as  an  exponential  function  of  travel  time 
between each pair of zones. 
 
𝑑𝑖𝑗(𝑡) =   𝑒α𝑡   
(3) 
 
where α is a parameter to be calibrated. 
 
Figures 9 and 10 show the spatial distribution of two accessibility indices calculated 
for private vehicle mode and public transportation. Both maps  are colored according 
to a division of the 460 zones into 10 groups with 46 zones in each group; the darker 
the colors the higher the accessibility of the group. 
 
While  accessibility  by  private  vehicle  has  a  spatial  distribution  in  the  shape  of 
concentric  rings,  with  higher  accessibility  the  closer  the  zone  is  to  the  center, 
accessibility by public transportation follows a different pattern. In this case, we can 
observe  a  relationship  between  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  index  and  the  urban 
railway network of the city in an approximate radial shape.

Vieira  and  Haddad  (2015)  also  show  an  interesting  pattern  of  spatial  mismatch 
relating  accessibility  and  income.  They  find  strong  spatial  correlation  between 
accessibility  and  income,  i.e.,  there  are  significant  clusters  of  high  income  and  high 
accessibility  in  the  central  part  of  São  Paulo,  and  low  income  and  low  accessibility 
clusters in the periphery.

We  estimate  the  empirical  models  related  to  wages  determination.  We  consider  a 
mincerian wage equation in the following way: 
 
ln 𝑤𝑖 = 𝛼0 + 𝑋𝑖𝛽 + 𝑅𝑟(𝑖)𝛾1 + 𝑊𝑃𝑤𝑝(𝑖)𝛾2 + 𝜃𝐴𝑟(𝑖) + 𝜀𝑖 
(4) 
 
Where the individual wage (𝑤𝑖) is explained by a set of individual characteristics (𝑋𝑖), 
attributes  of  the  region  of  residence  (𝑅𝑟(𝑖))  and  the  region  of  work  (𝑊𝑃𝑤𝑝(𝑖)),  the 
accessibility  index  (𝐴𝑟(𝑖)),  and  the  error  term  𝜀𝑖.  There  are  potential  endogeneity 
issues related to simultaneity of 𝑤𝑖 and 𝐴𝑟(𝑖), as discussed above.10  
 
In  addition  to  a  vector  of  individual  characteristics  (years  of  education,  age  and 
gender),  other  controls  in  the  model  include  place  of  work  and  sectoral  dummies. 
While the place of work dummies attempt to capture the urban structure and the peaks 
and  valleys  of  the  wage  surface  in  a  multi-centric  urban  configuration  (Fujita  and 
Ogawa,  1982;  Lucas  and  Rossi-Hansberg,  2002),  the  sectoral  dummies  take  into 
account  the  industry-mix  and  differences  in  wages  (and  productivity)  across  sectors 
within the metropolitan area. 
 
5. Data and Descriptive Analysis 
 
The theoretical approach outlined in Section 2 is based on the simultaneous analysis 
of the labor and the housing markets within an urban area. The analysis that follows 
covers  the  SPMR  using  as  the  main  database  the  micro  data  of  the  aforementioned 
OD survey. 
 
5.1. OD Survey and the Wage Equation 
 
Origin-destination  (OD)  surveys  aim  at  gathering  information  on  trips  done  by  the 
population  of  a  given  metropolitan  area  in  a  typical  business  day.  They  provide  the 
basis  for  urban  and  transportation  planning,  feeding  simulation  models  to  forecast 
trips and evaluate future projects of the transportation network. 
 
On a decennial basis, the São Paulo Metropolitan Company carries out the OD survey 
in  São  Paulo.  The  most  recent  available  data  refers  to  2007,  with  169,625 
observations obtained from around 30,000 households about trips made in that year in 
the SPMR. The metropolitan region comprises 39 municipalities (including São Paulo 
city). These municipalities are subdivided in 460 survey zones, the basic spatial units 
of  analysis  (the  municipality  of  São  Paulo  itself  is  composed  by  320  zones).  The 
survey  uses  a  stratified  sampling  technique,  with  error  margins  below  5%  and 
confidence intervals of 95%. 
 

                                                 
10 Other sources of endogeneity may arise from workers’ behavior. On the one hand, workers 
are more prone to commute long distances in exchange for higher wages. On the other hand, 
individuals  with  higher  incomes  may  locate  further  away  from  their  jobs  to  have  access  to 
amenities usually displaced in the outskirts of the city (Melo and Graham, 2009). 

13 

 

The  OD  survey  provides  detailed  information  at  the  individual  level  (income,  work 
characteristics, house and durable goods ownership, household size, among others). In 
addition,  it  has  trip  information  on  time,  latitude  and  longitude  for  departure  and 
arrival,  transportation  mode,  reason  of  the  trip,  etc.  This  survey  is  the  main  data 
source to investigate the relationship between wages and commuting time. 
 
The analysis considers the information on employed individuals with positive wages 
and  their  trips  from  home  to  work.  An  important  distinction  is  made  among  people 
commuting  by  public  transportation  and  with  private  vehicles.  In  this  context,  the 
main descriptive statistics that are relevant for this analysis are presented in Table 1.

We can highlight a few important aspects of Table 1. First, average wage for private 
vehicle  users  is  more  than  twice  the  average  wage  of  public  transportation  users. 
Second,  commuting  time  is  much  higher  for  public  transportation  users,  despite  the 
location of their residences being on average just a few kilometers further away from 
downtown  than  the  average  location  of  private  vehicle  users.  Third,  private  vehicle 
users  have  a  higher  accessibility  to  jobs  from  their  zone  of  residence  than  public 
transportation  users.  Finally,  as  shown  in  Figure  11,  there  is  a  strong  negative 
correlation  between  accessibility  to  jobs  and  the  distance  to  the  historical  center  by 
the rivers.

The next section discusses the main results from different estimations. The focus is on 
the  relevance  of  our  instrument,  distance  by  rivers  to  the  historical  center,  as  an 
exogenous  measure  of  the  centrality  that  shaped  urban  infrastructure  and  urban 
markets. 
 
6. Results 
 
The  empirical  strategy  discussed  in  Section  4  requires  the  estimation  of  different 
models  to  assess  the  relevance  of  accessibility  to  jobs  to  explain  wages.  However, 
accessibility  is  potentially  endogenous,  implying  the  need  to  use  an  exogenous 
instrument to avoid bias in this analysis. 
 
Following a mincerian equation estimation strategy, Table 3 presents the main results 
for  users  of  private  vehicles  and  public  transportation  as  transportation  modes  for 
daily trips from home to work. The first two models consider commuting time as an 
explanatory  factor  for  individual  wages.  It  is  noticeable  that  this  element  has  a 
negative influence only on wages of individuals commuting by public transportation. 
In  fact,  dependency  upon  public  transportation  in  SPMR  may  limit  the  amount  of 
effective  time  spent  at  work,  as  discussed  on  Section  4,  resulting  in  a  lower  wage. 
Longer  commuting  time  by  mass  transit  may  be  also  associated  to  peripheral 
residences,  which  may  also  reduce  both  the  efficiency  of  the  search  for  jobs  and  its 
intensity due to lower accessibility.  
 
The  benchmark  models  usually  considered  in  the  literature  (Models  3  and  4  from 
Table  3)  include,  apart  from  individual  controls,  the  logarithm  of  the  Euclidean 
distance  to  “ground  zero”  from  the  zone  of  residence.  In  these  cases,  individuals 
commuting by private vehicles would perceive a higher negative effect of distance to 
the CBD on their earnings than individuals using public transportation would. When 
accessibility  to  jobs  is  considered  in  a  richer  geography  setting  (Models  5  and  6),

users.  Taken  together,  these  results  are  consistent  with  the  fact  that  cars  allow  more 
flexibility to individuals, who can follow a broader range of paths in space, while such 
flexibility  lessens  for  SPMR  public  transportation  users,  since  the  public  transport 
infrastructure  is  closer  to  a  radial  structure.  Therefore,  proximity  to  the  center  or 
accessibility  to  jobs  will  be  translated  more  easily  in  real  opportunities  in  the  labor 
market in the case of private vehicle commuters. 
 
Finally,  Models  7  and  8  aim  at  dealing  with  the  endogeneity  issue  raised  earlier. 
Accessibility to jobs is instrumented by the distance to the historical center (Pateo do 
Collegio), following a path formed by rivers. The main conclusion we get from these 
results  is  that  the  effects  measured  by  accessibility  seem  to  be  underestimated  in 
Models 5 and 6.

One of the aims of this paper is to understand the effects of agglomeration economies 
on  urban  markets  at  the  SPMR.  The  strategy  was  to  estimate  a  wage  equation  to 
measure the effects of agglomeration economies on workers` productivity. We could 
complement  this  analysis  by  analyzing  the  other  relevant  urban  price,  namely  the 
price  of  land.  This  could  be  done,  for  instance,  through  the  estimation  of  a  hedonic 
price model  (to  measure  the effects  of agglomeration economies on housing prices). 
However,  there  is  potential  endogeneity  from  the  inclusion  of  our  index  of 
accessibility  to  jobs  in  these  models,  requiring  the  adoption  of  an  instrumental 
variables  strategy.  To  do  so,  we  consider,  in  the  exercise  of  the  wage  equation,  an 
exogenous geographical  measure, of which economic agents are fully unaware  – the 
distance from the zone of residence to the historical center by “invisible” rivers. 
 
The orthogonality condition between an instrument and the dependent variable given 
all other controls  requires that wages are affected by this geographical  variable only 
through  the  relationship  it  has  with  the  accessibility  index  (and  consequently  by  its 
relation  with  the  transportation  system  of  the  city).  Because  of  that,  it  is  possible  to 
measure  how  accessibility  affects  wages  through  agglomeration  effects  that  arise  in 
the labor market.  
 
The  results  indicate  that  the  IV  models  imply  that  the  accessibility  coefficient  is 
higher  than  their  OLS  counterparts  are.  This  suggests  that  the  OLS  models  are 
underestimating agglomeration economies effects on workers’ productivity. This may 
be because wages and accessibility to jobs are simultaneously determined (see Section 
2). Therefore, a share of the true effect of accessibility on wages is being lost because 
a third determinant may be capturing part of that relationship. Given the exogeneity of 

                                                 
11 In the appendix, Table A.1 provides similar results whenever the commuting time variable is 
included in specifications  such as Models 3 to 8 of Table 3. Therefore, the main  results from 
Table 3 seem to be robust to this slight change.

coefficient for the instrumented accessibility variable. 
 
Therefore,  significant  biases  are  generated  by  estimating  directly  the  relationship 
between  wages  and  accessibility.12  This  research  shows  that  an  instrument  based  in 
geography with historical roots is able to control for at least part of this issue.  
 
7. Final Remarks 
 
In 1959 Hansen asked the question: “How does accessibility shape land use?” In the 
last several decades, a great deal of research has focused on the measurement of the 
impact  of  accessibility  on  urban  markets,  including  analyses  that  have  attempted  to 
identify  the  main  channels  through  which  accessibility  to  jobs  may  affect  urban 
prices.  
 
A  great  part  of  the  empirical  studies  has  adopted  the  identification  hypothesis  of 
concentration of jobs in the central city to get rid of the uneasy endogeneity problem 
that could have potentially emerged. While appeal to dual outcomes could be made, it 
seems  that larger metropolitan areas in  the developing world  rarely comply with  the 
pure monocentric paradigm. A considerable level of employment decentralization is a 
common characteristic of megacities like São Paulo. The very size of SPMR provides 
opportunities  that  could  not  be  realized  by  similar  workers  located  within  other 
metropolises elsewhere. The case of SPMR has been further complicated by an urban 
transport  infrastructure  that  until  recently  was  poorly  regulated  and  biased  towards 
investments in roads to the exclusion of other modes.  
 
There are significant spatial inequalities in a large metropolitan region such as SPMR. 
Depending on the transportation mode, workers may see harmed their productivity or 
their  opportunities  to  find  a  better  matching  in  the  job  market.  As  for  the  housing 
market,  individuals  who  can  afford  a  higher  price  dwelling  will  be  better  located  in 
the city, closer to their jobs. 
 
Our  empirical  analysis,  despite  being  motivated  by  a  theoretical  general  equilibrium 
framework,  was  based  on  partial  equilibrium  modelling  strategies.  A  complete 
structural  model  comprising  the  simultaneous  determination  of  the  housing  and  the 
labor  markets  can  provide  further  insights  on  these  relationships.  Nonetheless,  the 
inclusion of an exogenous instrument allowed us to control for at least a share of the 
bias generated in this context. Rivers, nowadays hidden by roads, seem to have helped 
shaping urban markets in SPMR.
