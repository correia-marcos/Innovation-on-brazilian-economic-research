Abstract 

 
In  the  last  decades,  we  witness  an  increase  of  the  R&D  performed  abroad  by  multinational 
companies. These companies have progressively adopted an internationally integrated approach to 
their  inventive  activities.  This  paper  contributes  to  the  literature  on  R&D  internationalization  by 
analyzing locational factors, which drive multinational companies to use captive offshoring to fund 
their R&D activities in developing countries.  The paper considers the R&D investment performed 
by the majority-owned foreign affiliates of U.S. parent companies abroad. We construct a temporal 
database  panel  containing  75  countries  and  apply  a  random-effect  Tobit  model.  The  results 
highlight  some  important  determinants  to  explain  U.S.  R&D  captive  offshoring  in  a  developing 
country:  (1)  R&D  investment  cumulativeness;  (2)  National  Innovation  Systems  maturity;  and  (3) 
Market size. This implies that attracting knowledge and innovative activities from abroad depends 
on policies designed mainly to enhance some elements of National Innovation Systems.  
 
Key words: Innovation, R&D internationalization, R&D captive offshoring, MNC.

Introduction: setting the scene and research questions 

1 
 

In the last decades  we testimony a  fast  and increase  growth  of R&D performed abroad by 
multinational companies  (MNCs, henceforth) (UNCTAD, 2005a, 2005b; OECD, 2008) which has 
become  recognized  by  many  scholars  who  got  interested  in  the  strong  trend  towards  its 
internationalization1.  Notwithstanding  that,  international  allocation  of  research  activities  is  not 
recent (Lall, 1979; Cantwell, 1995). 

The expansionary trend of private U.S. R&D performed abroad through foreign affiliates – 
the  so-called  R&D  captive  offshoring  –  provides  a  sound  example  of  private  R&D 
internationalization. Indeed, there are recent studies that demonstrate there is a continuing increase 
of  U.S.  private  R&D  abroad  (Laurens  et  al.,  2015;  NSB,  2016).  Figures  from  1997  illustrate  that 
U.S. R&D captive offshoring was USD 18,935 million and it reached USD 39,470 million in 20102. 
In  relative  terms,  it  represented  9.4%  of  overall  R&D  developed  at  home  in  1997  and  14.1%  in 
2010.  

Both economic and business literature has paid ample attention to the locational factors that 
affect  U.S.  R&D internationalization.  There are  numerous empirical  studies carried out  in  the last 
decades which revel that R&D intensity of U.S. affiliates is determined mainly by domestic market 
size,  overall  R&D  capability  and  cost  of  hiring  R&D  personnel  (Kumar,  1996,  2001;  Doh  et  al., 
2005;  Thursby  &  Thursby,  2006;  Flores  &  Aguilera,  2007;  Hegde  &  Hicks,  2008;  Athukorala  & 
Kohpaiboon,  2010).  Moreover,  there  are  other  relevant  factors  such  as  domestic  business 
environment  aspects  –  availability  of  technical  personnel,  nature  of  property  right  legislation,  tax 
concessions, political stability, foreign trade regime  (Athukorala & Kohpaiboon, 2010) – and also 
institutional and cultural aspects – political and legal systems, cultural similarities and levels of trust 
(Flores & Aguilera, 2007).  

That  being  said,  most  U.S.  R&D  captive  offshoring  is  performed  in  Europe,  Canada  and 
Japan – Triad countries (Chesnais, 1994). In fact, ‘Triad’ receives 73.6% of total U.S. R&D captive 
offshoring in 2010 and if we consider in this group other high-income countries such as Australia, 
New  Zealand  and  the  Asian  Dragons  (Hong  Kong,  Singapore,  Taiwan  and  South  Korea),  the 
concentration  increases  to  88.5%.  The  other  11.5%  goes  to  the  ‘Rest’of  which  Brazil,  China  and 
India  concentrate  77.1%.  Looking  at  a  long-term  perspective,  Brazil,  China  and  India  seem  to  be 
more and more attractive players in global R&D while other middle and low-income countries are 
still not part of the game.  

If  that  holds  true,  why  do  some  developing  countries  such  as  Brazil,  China  and  India 
concentrate more U.S. R&D investment? This question straightly leads to the following one:  What 
are  the  local  features  that  make  some  developing  countries  more  ‘inviting’  for  U.S.  R&D  captive 
offshoring? 

Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the locational factors that are more (or less) 
relevant in a developing country3 to attract R&D investment from MNCs headquartered in the U.S.. 
Once we identify those factors, we can provide insights to answer the previous questions. Although 
there is an academic literature that examines empirically the factors that drive the location choice of 
R&D  activity  abroad  (Demirbag  &  Glaister,  2010;  Siedschlag  et  al.,  2013),  there  is  a  limited 
number  of  studies  that  present  a  specific  analysis  regarding  developing  countries’  specificities 
focusing in  emerging markets  such as Brazil, China and  India, taking  into  account the U.S. R&D

captive offshore. In short, this paper fills this gap, throwing some light on the locational features of 
Brazil,  China  and  India  that  make  them  more  attractive  than  other  developing  countries  for  U.S. 
companies’ R&D investments. It also complements the work done by Chiarini (2017), who makes 
an exploratory analysis of the recent U.S. inward R&D-related FDI in Brazil, China and India. This 
is where the originality of this study lies and where it intends to make its contributions. 

The reminder of the  paper is  organized as follows. On section 2, we make an appreciative 
theorizing, showing that  R&D is  a key activity  and it is  performed  at  home (onshore) and  abroad 
(offshore). It is important to mention that by no means this section covers all the literature available 
on corporate R&D efforts and its internationalization as it goes beyond the scope of this paper and 
once  it  is  possible  to  find  it  elsewhere4.  Against  this  background,  on  section  3,  we  present  the 
empirical  methodology  (data,  some  descriptive  analysis  of  the  database  and  the  modelling).  On 
section 4, we present the econometric results. On section 5, we introduce an exploratory discussion 
on what  regards Brazil, China and  India as the  main developing countries receivers of  U.S.  R&D 
investment. Finally, in the last section, we address the main conclusions.  

 
Framing corporate investment in R&D: why to invest abroad 

2 
 
Companies’  competitive  advantages  come  from  their  accumulated  capabilities  to  create, 
 
transfer,  combine,  assemble,  integrate  and  exploit  knowledge  assets.  Knowledge  assets  help 
building  the  company’s  capabilities  which  in  turn  underpin  the  company’s  products  and  services 
offering to the markets  (Teece, 2004). Consequently, performing R&D is a relevant activity, once 
not only does it generate new knowledge, but also enhances the company’s ability to assimilate and 
exploit existing ones from the environment – what it is called a firms’ ‘absorptive’ capacity (Cohen 
& Levinthal, 1989, 1990).  

It is part of a company’s strategy to decide to perform R&D in the home country (onshore) 
and/or  in  a  foreign  country  (offshore).  In  order  to  take  advantage  of  foreign  technological 
capacities,  companies  locate  their  research  labs  and  production  facilities  in  many  locations  via 
networks of internal units (set of subsidiaries and headquarters) and via external networks. This way 
it  is  possible  to  access  the  tacit  part  of  technology  that  is  specific  to  the  context  in  which  new 
technologies  are  created.  To  access  the  complementary  assets  to  innovation,  MNCs  have  local 
presence  through  the  combination  of  research  (for  learning)  and  skills  related  routines  in  the 
production.  

We  can  say  that  the  innovative  efforts  are  a  principal  source  of  a  company’s  ownership 
advantages. In this way, the ownership advantages are dynamic: they seek to improve and to search 
news  advantages.  The  learning  process  that  leads  to  innovation  is  also  an  ownership  advantages, 
and  subsidiaries  can  enlarge  their  knowledge  base  from  the  global,  local  or  internal  knowledge 
network,  which  are  contingent  on  the  strategic  choice  made  by  the  headquarters  (Athreye  et  al., 
2016). Therefore, MNCs that are able to organize a network – subsidiaries and parent companies – 
to  knowledge  creation  and  exploitation  taking  advantage  of  local  specificities,  act  in  different 
National Systems of Innovation.       

Before  the  1980s,  innovative  activities  were  mainly  centralized  and  performed  in-house  in 
the home country (Kurokawa et al., 2007) especially because of supply-side reasons such as scale 
economies (Vernon, 1966) and because of higher appropriability of R&D efforts (Granstrand et al., 
1993). Notwithstanding that, it was also possible to see a growing R&D outsourced to providers in 
the home country, especially to universities and research institutes (Nelson, 1990).  

A  strong  trend  towards  the  internationalization  of  R&D  begins  in  the  1980s  (Archibugi  & 
Michie,  1997;  Archibugi  &  Iammarino,  2002;  UNCTAD,  2005a)  both  captive  offshoring  and 
offshore  outsourcing,  nevertheless  empirical  studies  show  that  the  former  is  still  preferred  to  the 
latter  (Albertoni  &  Elia,  2014).  The  increasing  offshoring  trend  is  driven  in  large  measure  by 
technology  factors  (Florida,  1997).  Thus,  companies  perform  R&D  abroad  to  secure  access  to

scientific and technical human capital (Florida, 1997) – even if they risk to have their R&D leaked 
to foreign competitors  (Athukorala & Kohpaiboon, 2010) – in order to improve existing assets and 
to tap into knowledge around the globe (Dunning & Narula, 1995). Accordingly, this trend reflects 
the global  character of knowledge assets  creation and exploitation  (Teece, 2004).  In fact,  a recent 
econometric study suggests that MNCs that offshore their innovative activities are more productive 
that those that offshore their non-innovative tasks (Tabrizy, 2017). 

Innovation  studies  literature  indicate  that  there  are  two  centrifugal  ‘forces’  capable  of 
explaining the dispersion of R&D activities abroad. Firstly, because of the need to adapt production 
processes and products to suit to local conditions and regulations, i.e., asset/competence exploiting 
or home-base-exploiting R&D (Dunning & Narula, 1995; Kuemmerle, 1999; Cantwell & Mudambi, 
2005).  In  fact,  a  large  share  of  R&D  investments  from  MNCs  has  been  focused  on  the 
adaptation/standardization to local demand conditions, especially in developing countries.  

Secondly, in order to benefit from localized technology spillovers in these locations, that is, 
companies  locate  R&D  facilities  abroad,  especially  in  prominent  centers  of  excellence  in  specific 
technologies, in order to enable themselves to enrich their own R&D (Athukorala & Kohpaiboon, 
2010),  i.e.,  asset/competence  augmenting  or  home-base-augmenting  R&D  (Kuemmerle,  1999; 
Dunning, 2009).  This is the case to overcome lock-in traps, i.e., MNCs perform research abroad to 
have access to  external  knowledge available  (Levinthal & March, 1993), to benefit from potential 
knowledge  spillover  opportunities  (Feinberg  &  Gupta,  2004)  and  to  take  advantage  of  qualified 
personnel (Lewin et al., 2009).  

Many developing countries try to attract high-value added activities (R&D, engineering and 
product  design)  from  abroad,  however,  attracting  foreign  investment  in  R&D  and  trying  to  host 
innovative activities may require the participation of the most productive MNCs that are likely to be 
larger in size (Tabrizy, 2017). This may have negative effects for emerging countries.  

For  example,  if  MNCs  acquire  indigenous  firms’  research  facilities,  the  host  country  loses 
the control towards the technology previously locally  produced and may  also  reduce the levels  of 
research done locally. As part of rationalization strategies, mergers and acquisitions may lead to a 
reduction of R&D activities and the remaining R&D becomes narrower in scope (or more focused) 
and its time horizon becomes shorter (UNCTAD, 2005b). There are empirical evidences that show 
that less developed countries are chosen for low-value R&D (or adaptive R&D), that is, product and 
processes adaptation to local conditions and activities not related to knowledge creation. Therefore, 
MNCs may impose a new type of international division of labor in which advanced countries carry 
high-value R&D activities while less developed countries carry low-value R&D. The former adding 
more  value  in  the  global  chains  and  the  latter  adding  relatively  much  less  value,  blocking  the 
national system of innovation access to the global knowledge network (Marin & Arza, 2009).  

The arguments developed in this section point to the many locational factors that affect the 
decision  of  a  company  to  offshore  R&D.  For  example,  different  levels  of  territorial  and  social 
embeddedness  may  or  may  not  motivate  overseas  R&D  and  its  location  (Cantwell  &  Piscitello, 
2002). Therefore, the motivations and determinants  to  establish R&D labs in  different  developing 
economies  may  diverge  and  only  a  small  number  of  them  are  able  to  attract  foreign  R&D 
investment.  In  the  next  section,  we  propose  different  econometric  models  that  help  us  understand 
why only a few of them can take part of this very fierce game.

3.1.1  Dependent variable: U.S. R&D captive offshoring data 
 

The departure point of the database is the dependent variable U.S. corporates’ R&D captive 
offshoring.  The  U.S.  Bureau  of  Economic  Analysis  (BEA)  provides  historical  series  for  outward 
direct  investment  including  R&D  figures  in  millions  of  current  U.S.  dollars  for  many  countries 
worldwide.  However,  for  many  others  BEA  presents  an  aggregate  value  for  a  group  of  them 
according to their geographical region, this is so to avoid disclosure of confidential information or 
because the value invested was relatively insignificant.  

We assumed null value for these grouped countries, since the sum by region was statistically 
irrelevant.  For  example,  in  2000  ‘other  European  countries’  accounted  for  about  USD  9  million 
(only 0.05% of U.S. R&D captive offshoring in total Europe). In the same year, for instance, ‘other 
South American countries’ accounted for less than USD 500 thousand. 

We  also  deflated  the  time  series  using  the  GDP  deflator  (year-base  2010)  available  at  the 
WB database. Once the database regarding the U.S. corporates’ R&D captive offshoring was done, 
the  first  things  to  note  was  its  increase  thorough  time  (Table  2)  and  its  fluctuation  together  with 
economic cycles. From 1997 to 2000, the average growth rate was 10.50% per year, however, with 
the Dot.com bubble burst in late 1990s, U.S. corporate R&D investment abroad falls and the rate in 
2001-04  reduces  to  3.97%  per  year.  In  the  following  period  (2005-08),  investment  starts  to  grow 
again,  reaching  9.90%  per  year,  when  there  is  an  economic  recovery.  However,  with  the  2008 
financial crises, R&D investment abroad reduces drastically and there is a negative growth rate of 
3.61%  (in  2009-10).  This  suggests  that  R&D  investment  is  pro-cyclical  and  it  is  sensitive  to 
economic conditions (Archibugi & Michie, 1995). Therefore, we control the models with a dummy 
trying to capture the economic cycles. 

Table  2  also  permits  us  to  verify  right  away  that  most  of  U.S.  R&D  captive  offshoring  is 
concentrated in developed countries and they concentrate as an average 91.09% of total U.S. R&D 
investment abroad (in 1997-2010).

Independent variable: Innovation system data 
 
Another variable used in the model is what we called ‘innovation system’ and we defined it 
as  the  first  factor  obtained  by  the  factor  analysis  technique  for  different  variables.  There  many 
possible  variables  used  in  the  literature  to  characterize  an  innovation  system  (IS)  ranging  from  a 
narrow to broad definition of IS (Lundvall et al., 2009). The previous focuses on effort-related and 
performance-related  indicators.  The  main  ones  proposed  are  R&D  expenditure,  S&T  expenditure, 
human  resources  allocation  in  R&D,  patent  applications,  scientific  publications,  etc.  (Lundvall  et 
al.,  2009).  However,  some  IS  elements  and  relationships  that  directly  affect  the  national  learning 
capacity  are  both  informal  and  difficult  to  measure.  For  this  reason,  in  a  broad  perspective,  other 
indicators that analyze social institutions, communication and education infrastructure, the type of 
relationship between actors, etc., should be considered (Lundvall et al., 2009). 

Unfortunately,  due  to  the  lack  of  comparable  data  in  historical  perspective  for  many 

countries, we opt to focus only on indicators from a narrow definition of IS. The ones selected are: 
 

a.  R&D investment; 
b.  Patents deposited at USPTO per capita; 
c.  High-technology exports; 
d.  Economic complexity index (ECI); 
e.  Scientific/technical journal articles per capita. 

 

‘R&D  investment’  is  the  current  and  capital  expenditures  (both  public  and  private)  on 
creative  work  undertaken  systematically  to  increase  knowledge.  R&D  covers  basic  research, 
applied research, and experimental development. ‘USPTO patents per capita’, on its turn, refers to 
the  number  of  patent  applications  filed  in  the  United  States  Patent  Office  by  country  of  origin  – 
based on the residence of the first-named inventor – per million inhabitants.  

The factor ‘High-technology exports’ represents products with high R&D intensity, such as 
in aerospace, computers, pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, and electrical machinery. And the 
factor ECI, according to Hausmann et al. (2013), is a scale that uses the theory of and calculations 

 

6 

for  economic  complexity  to  rank  countries  according  to  their  level  of  complexity.  It  ranks  how 
diversified and complex a country’s export basket is5.   

Finally, the factor ‘Scientific and technical journal articles per capita’ refers to the number 
of  scientific  and  engineering  (physics,  biology,  chemistry,  mathematics,  clinical  medicine, 
biomedical  research,  engineering and technology, and earth and space sciences)  articles published 
per million inhabitants. 

The  first  factor  is  able  to  explain  99.75%  of  total  variance.  Besides,  each  variable  has  the 
following  correlation  with  first  factor:  ‘R&D  expenditure’:  0.9646;  ‘USPTO  patents  per  capita’: 
0.8848;  ‘High-technology  exports’:  0.3671;  ECI:  0.7497;  ‘Scientific/technical  journal  articles  per 
capita’: 0.8162.   

 

3.1.3  List of countries 
 

Getting  a  temporal  database  for  a  large  number  of  countries  is  not  an  easy  task.  There  is 
non-negligible lack of information  for many of them, which makes quite hard to  form  a balanced 
panel  data.  We  made  an  exhaustive  work  to  make  databases  compatible  in  order  to  include  the 
largest number of countries as possible. We got in total 75 countries (dispersed all over the world) 
that appears at least one year at the sample (Table 3).  Unfortunately, we were not able to consider 
more countries since information were not available and among the considered 75 ones, there is still 
a lot of missing data, which means that we were obligated to deal with an unbalanced panel data6. 
These are probably unneglectable limitations of the database and consequently of the model. 

With the list presented in Table 3, we could separate them into developed versus developing 
countries. It is worth to  emphasize that the group of developing countries is not stable throughout 
our  period  of  analyzes  (1997–2010)  once  we  used  the  level  of  income  as  a  proxy  for  economic 
development. Therefore, some countries historically changed their income level status, according to 
the World Bank methodology. For example, Croatia is considered a high-income country only after 
2008,  so  from  1997  to  2007  it  is  grouped  as  a  developing  economy  (middle  and  low-income 
country).  Other  countries considered high income countries  are:  South  Korea  (from 2001), Saudi 
Arabia  (from  2004),  Trinidad  and  Tobago  (from  2006),  Barbados  (from  2006),  Czech  Republic 
(from 2006), Estonia (from 2006), Slovakia (from 2007), Hungary (from 2007), Latvia (from 2009) 
and Poland (from 2009). Consequently, the groups of developing countries vary yearly.

6   According to  Wooldridge (2008) this  should  not be considered a crucial problem,  since  the reason  for the lack of 

data of some observation i is not correlated with the idiosyncratic errors.

With  the  data  available,  we  opt  to  use  a  panel  data  econometric  method  for  censored 
outcomes  through  random-effect  Tobit  model7.    The  panel  data  is  important  considering  the  time 
interval (1997-2010) and it combined with a Tobit model since a large number of countries has null 
values for U.S. R&D captive offshoring during the period (so, a left-censored dependent variable in 
zero).  

The random-effects Tobit model is calculated using quadrature, which is  an approximation 
whose  accuracy  depends  partially  on  the  number  of  integration  points  used.  Then,  we  establish  a 
procedure to check the quadrature approximation, verifying whether the changes in the number of 
integration points affect the outcomes8. We define three distinct models: 

 

a.  a complete model with all the 75 countries in data base;  
b.  a model with only developed countries (high-income countries); and  
c.  a model with only developing countries (low and middle-income countries).   

 
To test the robustness of each model we tried two different specifications: 

 

a.  GDP per capita and population presented in logarithm values;  
b.  GDP per capita and population presented in natural value. 

 
Therefore,  we  have  six  different  models.  Finally,  we  performed  different  tests  to  find  the 
best  quadrature  for  all  six  models.  As  a  rule  of  thumb,  if  the  coefficients  do  not  change  by  more 
than  a  relative  difference  of  10−4  (0.01%),  the  choice  of  quadrature  points  does  not  significantly 
affect  the  outcome,  and  we  can  confidently  interpret  the  results.  We  reach  confidence  when 
considering  a  maximum  of  195  integration  points  (the  upper  limit  of  integration  points)  since  the 
model  with  developed  countries  subsample  specified  by  GDP  per  capita  presented  in  log  values 
(called Model 2) demands that.  Model 1 (full sample specified by GDP per capita presented in log 
values) reached consistent results with at least 120 integration points. We present the models in the 
next section. 

 
Econometric results and discussions 

4 
 

As  presented  in  section  3.2  before,  we  had  two  different  specifications  of  our  models.  We 
use  GDP  per  capita  and  population  data  in  both  logarithm  values  and  in  natural  values.  The  two 
specifications  seem  to  be  robust,  that  is,  GDP  per  capita  and  population  in  both  logarithm  and 
natural values do not change drastically the estimation results.  In Table 4, we present the parameter 
estimates and results for all the models, and then, in the next subsections, we propose some possible 
interpretations. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                           
7   There  is  no  way  to  proceed  with  a  parametric  conditional  fixed-effects  model,  as  it  does  not  exist  a  sufficient 
statistic allowing the fixed effects to be conditioned out of the likelihood. Unconditional fixed-effects Tobit models 
would be fit with the Tobit command, but the estimators would be biased. The software used is STATA 13. 

8   We use the quadrature check command in Stata (quadchk) to verify coefficient results’ consistency.

4.1 
 

Previous R&D investments 

We find there is a positive relation of current R&D expenditure with previous year’s R&D 
expenses  for  all  the  models  presented  in  Table  4.  This  positive  relation  may  be  derived  from  the 
rigidity of investment in innovative activities, since previous R&D investments define a sort of sunk 
cost  whose  maintenance  of  investment  becomes  necessary  for  the  maintenance  of  already 
established  R&D  activities.  In  other  words,  technological  knowledge  generation  may  be 
characterized by elements of a path-dependent persistence (Narula, 2002; Antonelli & Colombelli, 
2013). 

That  being  said,  one  can  propose  that  R&D  is  cumulative  and  complementary,  that  is, 
inventive  activities  are  conditioned  on  knowledge  levels  already  achieved  by  the  companies. 
Therefore,  the  generation  of  new  knowledge  is  built  upon  current  and  past  knowledge  (Nelson  & 
Winter, 1985; Malerba & Orsenigo, 1993) and innovative success yields profits that can be invested 
again  in  R&D  (Nelson  &  Winter,  1985),  encouraging  more  R&D  and  innovation.  According  to 
Antonelli  and  Colombelli  (2013),  the  “generation  of  new  knowledge  at  time  t  is  possible  only 

 

9 

standing upon the shoulders of the technological knowledge that has been generated until that time” 
(p.  31).  Therefore,  R&D  cumulativeness  and  complementarity  may  create  a  group  of  developing 
host  countries  where  U.S.  companies  keep  investing  in  R&D,  promoting  a  sort  of  R&D 
centralization.  

The  previous  finding  corroborates  other  empirical  studies  presented  in  the  literature.  For 
example, Demirbag and Glaister (2010) show that MNCs’ prior R&D activities in a specific country 
increases the likelihood of that country being selected by the MNCs for offshoring R&D projects. 

Indeed  that  is  exactly  what  data  presented  in  Table  2  shows:  most  U.S.  R&D  captive 
offshoring  throughout  the  years  is  still  confined  to  Triad  countries  even  though  it  seems  to  be 
evolving  into  a  ‘new  geography’  (Bruche,  2009),  increasingly  extending  its  investment  to  some 
developing countries. In this regards, Table 2 shows that, in 1990s the target of U.S. corporate R&D 
in  developing  economies  was  focused  in  Latin  American  countries  (huge  investments  in  Brazil). 
However,  in  the  2000s  there  is  a  turn  towards  South  Asian  countries.  China  and  India  enter  the 
global R&D scene (Bruche, 2009).  
 
4.2  Market size 
 

The  market  size  is  measured  by  two  aspects:  population  size  and  income  (whose  proxy  is 
GDP  per  capita).  While  population  size  presents  statistical  significance  for  all  the  models  (except 
for  Model  5),  GDP  per  capita  presents  statistical  significance  for  Model  1  and  Model  4  (which 
consider all 75 countries) and for Model 3 and Model 6 (which consider only developing countries 
through  the  years).  Model  2  and  Model  5  (which  consider  only  developed  countries)  do  not  have 
GDP  per  capita  statistically  significant.  That  said,  we  can  suggest  that  U.S.  corporate’  captive 
offshoring may be affected by host countries’ population and GDP per capita – market size proxies. 
This confirms the importance of demand as presented in some empirical studies (Cantwell & Janne, 
2000). This is an expected result, as local demands generate product adaptation needs. In this sense, 
cultural preferences, local infrastructure features or even climatic conditions – i.e., particularities of 
markets – are taken into consideration.  

For example, in Brazil it is well known that automotive industry performs what it is called 
‘tropicalization’(Costa,  2005;  Consoni  &  Quadros,  2006)  –  adaptation  of  products  to  local 
conditions. One example of this is that carmakers subsidiaries in the country need to equip cars with 
specially developed damping systems due to road conditions. 

 
International openness 

4.3 
 

In all models presented in Table 4, the sum of exports of goods and services plus imports of 
goods and services as a percentage of GDP – proxies for the country’s international openness – was 
not statistically significant. Therefore, data tell us that characteristics of international openness are 
not relevant for U.S. corporate R&D captive offshoring. 

This  finding  corroborates  the  empirical  analysis  proposed  by  Kumar  (2001)  that  says  that 
economic openness is not statistically significant for attracting U.S. R&D expenditure to developing 
countries.  His  openness  variable  is  different  than  the  one  proposed  here.  He  tries  to  capture  the 
relative policy openness of a country’s trade regime and his variable was estimated by adjusting the 
trade intensity (total merchandise trade as a percentage of GNP) for structural factors. According to 
him  “more  restrictive  trade  regimes  may  attract  more  R&D  investments  than  more  open  ones 
keeping  other  things  same,  especially  in  developing  countries.  A  possible  explanation  for  this 
outcome  is  that  import  barriers  encourage  MNE  affiliates  to  undertake  indigenization  and  hence 
product and process adaptations locally by making imported alternatives more expensive.” (p. 169). 
This  is  a  significant  result  once  it  goes  against  the  expectation  that  productive  integration 
would  be  an  inductor  of  the  technological  upgrade.  This  refers  to  other  inductive  factors,  and 
immediately to the role of the State capable of inducing such investments.

4.4 

Innovation system  

 

The factor representing the National Innovation Systems – R&D expenditure, USPTO patent 
application  per  capita,  high-technology  exports,  economic  complexity  index,  and  scientific  and 
technical articles per capita – is relevant for U.S. corporate R&D captive offshoring.  

Although the National Systems of Innovation are statistically significant in all models, there 
are  considerable  differences  in  coefficient  magnitudes.  Considering  only  developed  countries 
(Model 2 and Model 5) one can conclude that their Innovation Systems seem to be relatively more 
relevant to U.S. companies in their decision in R&D captive offshoring than developing countries 
(Model 3 and Model 6), which could confirm the knowledge augmenting type hypothesis of R&D 
abroad in developed countries (Kuemmerle, 1999; Dunning, 2009).  

The influence of the National Innovation System of a host country on the location decision 
of MNCs’ R&D activities was also  empirically  presented by  Demirbag  and Glaister (2010). They 
show  that  the  more  developed  the  knowledge  infrastructure  and  the  larger  the  pool  of  experts  for 
R&D projects of a country, the greater the likelihood of that country being selected by a MNC for 
offshore R&D projects. 

For  the  developing  countries,  it  seems  that  U.S.  companies  are  interested  in  their  level  of 
income, indicated by their GDP per  capita.  It  does not  mean, however, that developing countries’ 
Innovation  Systems  are  not  important  –  since  the  coefficient  of  this  variable  is  significant  – 
however  less  important  that  developed  countries’  innovation  systems.  This  could  corroborate  the 
thesis of knowledge exploiting or home-base-exploiting R&D in developing countries (Dunning & 
Narula, 1995; Kuemmerle, 1999).  

In  this  regard,  the  average  value  for  ‘Innovation  System’  variable  in  developing  countries 
with  positive  values  for  U.S.  R&D  captive  offshoring  is  -0.46,  and  -0.66  for  countries  with  null 
values.  In  developed  countries  these  values  are,  respectively,  1.04  and  -0.36.  Furthermore, 
comparing  trajectories  of  countries  that  have  reached  a  high-income  country  status  (proxy  for 
development) during the period gives interesting insights. Countries with null values for U.S. R&D 
captive  offshoring  –  Croatia,  Estonia,  Latvia,  Saudi  Arabia,  Slovak  and  Trinidad  and  Tobago  –  
have medium values of Innovation Systems equal to -0.56 in 1997 and -0.30 in 2010 (only Estonia 
presents  significance  improvement  on  results,  from  -0.48  to  0.46).  The  other  countries  –  Czech 
Republic,  Hungary,  Korea  Republic  and  Poland  –  obtained  an  average  growth  for  U.S.  R&D 
investments of 14.9% per year in the face of an average increase in the Innovation System’s value 
of 0.03 to 0.72.

Controlling variables 
 
For all the models presented, we use a group of controlling variables (distance and dummy 
for economic cycles). Geographical distance is not significant in any model, that is, U.S. companies 
do not consider the distance of the country where they are going to invest in R&D. This is so once 
those  ‘transactional  benefits  of  spatial  proximity’  are  much  less  important  today  than  they  were 
before (Dunning, 2009). Therefore, the decision to invest in R&D either in Brazil or in Mexico is 
not affected by the proximity to the U.S. This is congruent with other empirical studies that show 
that geographic distance has a relatively low impact on R&D investment (Castellani et al., 2013). 

The  other  controlling  variable  used  is  the  dummy  for  economic  cycles.  This  is  done  once 
there  are  fluctuations  of  R&D  investment  during  the  period  of  analysis.  From  Table  2,  we  can 
noticed  that  U.S.  R&D  captive  offshoring  declined  during  economic  crisis  (2000-01  and  2009) 
mainly  because  of  the  investment  reduction  in  developed  countries,  as  those  countries  were  the 
epicenter of the crisis (Lane, 2012). Therefore, we can expect that R&D expenditures are sensitive 
to economic cycles, as presented in the literature (Archibugi & Michie, 1995; Guellec & Ioannidis, 
1997; François & Lloyd-Ellis, 2009).  

Still on the same argument, looking at Table 4, we can see that the Dotcom Crisis (2000-01) 
was not statically significant for any model. However, the Financial Crisis (2009) was for  Model 1 

11 

 

and  Model  4  (which  consider  the  75  countries)  and  Model  2  and  Model  5  (which  consider  only 
developed  countries),  affecting  negatively  U.S.  R&D  captive  offshoring.  In  other  words,  in  those 
years,  U.S.  corporate  R&D  captive  offshoring  in  developed  countries  was  negatively  affect  by 
economic cycles. This is expected, once returns to R&D investment are subject to uncertainty and 
during national income drastic reductions companies do not expect to invest in risky and long-term 
activities.  

In what regards Model 3 and Model 6, crisis were not statistically significant to explain U.S. 
corporate R&D captive offshoring in developing countries. The previous finding may suggest that 
U.S.  R&D  captive  offshoring  in  those  countries  is  more  resilient  to  the  financial  crisis  than 
developed countries. This may be so once R&D performed in developing countries are home-base-
exploiting type. Therefore those countries, which did not suffer immediately the negative impacts of 
the crisis, continued to receive R&D investment from the U.S. (especially Brazil, China, India and 
Indonesia) in order to get adapted production processes and products to suit local conditions and to 
take advantage of their market size.  

We  could  also  suggest  that  the  strategy  of  U.S.  companies  in  what  regards  their  inventive 
activities is to reduce monetary inversions in countries where there is a higher stock of investments 
(developed  countries),  preserving  the  values  in  countries  with  lower  R&D  structure  (developing 
countries). The U.S. R&D captive offshoring average in developed and developing countries were, 
respectively,  USD  959.9  million  and  USD  56.4  million  during  all  period  of  analysis9.  During  the 
economic  downturns,  the  R&D  investment  decline  in  relation  to  the  previous  year  was  7.3%  for 
developed countries and 5.1% for developing ones in  the  first  cycle (2000–01) and 12.5%  for the 
former and 2.0% for the latter in the second cycle (2009). 

 
Brief analysis of the most attractive developing countries to U.S. R&D investment 

5 
 

Brazil  and  China  are  emblematic  cases  to  understand  the  evolution  of  U.S.  R&D  captive 
offshoring in developing countries and their ability in attracting it. During the period 199 –2010, the 
increase in GDP per capita was of 27.4% and 215.9% in Brazil and China, respectively.   

The  increase  of  U.S.  R&D  captive  offshoring  experienced  by  China  –  and  presented  in 
Table 2 – must have happened for the most part because of Chinese Innovation System. Brazil has 
its value for ‘Innovation System variable’ varying between -0.10 and -0.24 in the period, without a 
clear improvement trend. China, on the other hand, has seen its ‘Innovation System variable’ value 
jump from -0.49 in 1997 to 0.43 in 2010, in a constant upward trend.  

Therefore,  considering  the  models’  findings  presented  in  Table  4,  the  national  innovation 
capacity improvement is important to ensure China has a better long-term position to maintain and 
increase its attractiveness in R&D investments from U.S. companies. Therefore, if Brazil continues 
‘to  skid’  on  innovative  results,  its  trend  should  be  less  satisfactory  than  the  Chinese  ones. 
Consequently,  upgrading  S&T  infrastructures  and  institutions  must  be  a  continuous  policy  in 
developing countries. In fact, recent empirical studies demonstrate that those countries that join the 
league of receivers of knowledge and innovation from FDI invest in elements of absorptive capacity 
(Filippetti et al., 2017). For that reason, investments in human resources, physical infrastructure and 
R&D are the basic policies a developing country should focus on. 

Back  to  the  question  proposed  in  the  Introduction  of  this  paper:  why  do  some  developing 
countries  such  as  Brazil,  China  and  India  concentrate  more  U.S.  R&D  investment?    According  to 
our  models,  the  answer  lies  on  the  fact  that  those  three  countries  have  already  accumulated  great 
amounts  of  U.S.  R&D  investment,  the  size  of  their  markets  and  because  of  their  relatively  better 
Innovation System vis-à-vis other developing countries.  

Despite  the  increasing  of  U.S.  R&D  in  Brazil,  China  and  India,  some  recent  empirical 
studies demonstrate that favorable conditions of host countries may not lead to the enhancement of 
subsidiaries’  R&D  functions  (Achcaoucaou  et  al.,  2017).  Therefore,  knowledge  integrations

between  parent  companies  and  their  subsidiaries  are  not  simple  and  do  not  happen  automatically 
(Singh, 2008). 

In fact, in what regards the case of Brazil, China and India,  Chiarini (2017) show elements 
present in the literature that demonstrate that most R&D undertaken in the three previous countries 
is directed to local adaptations and not directed to new product development. In other words, R&D 
captive  offshore  in  Brazil,  China  and  India  is  focused  mainly  in  activities  devoted  merely  to 
adapting products to local reality, that is, ‘adaptive R&D’. 

 
Final considerations 

6 

 

With significant changes in international economic scenario, companies have changed their 
strategies  taking  into  consideration  the  governance  (outsourcing  versus  internal  development)  and 
geographical  location  (offshoring  versus  domestic)  of  their  innovative  efforts  (Mudambi,  2008; 
Martinez-Noya  et  al.,  2012).  Indeed,  large  MNCs  have  progressively  adopted  an  internationally 
integrated approach to their inventive activities. 

In this paper, we provided a statistical investigation aimed at gaining further understanding 
of  corporates’  R&D  internationalization,  which  has  been  increasing  in  the  last  decades  towards 
developing countries. From stylized facts of U.S. R&D performed by business enterprises abroad in 
their  majority-owned  foreign  affiliates,  we  presented  our  research  question:  what  are  the  local 
features that make some developing countries  – like Brazil, China and India  – more ‘inviting’ for 
U.S. R&D captive offshoring? 

To  present  quantitative  elements  to  answer  the  previous  question,  we  proposed  different 
models. Our models’ results were pretty much in line with those already identified in the literature 
on MNCs’ location choice decision; however, they extended it presenting additional considerations 
and identifications of relevant differences of R&D captive offshoring determinants for developing 
countries.  

Our  study  found  that  R&D  investment  cumulativeness,  National  Innovation  Systems’ 
features  and  market  size  are  important  determinants  to  explain  U.S.  R&D  captive  offshoring  in  a 
developing  country.  Notwithstanding  that,  our  study  revealed  that  international  openness  have  no 
statistical relevance for the same group of countries. 

It  is  necessary  to  say  that  each  country  may  benefit  differently  depending  of  the  type  of 
R&D  undertaken  and  to  the  particularities  of  their  National  Innovation  Systems.  Therefore,  even 
with  the  increase  of  U.S.  R&D  captive  offshore  in  Brazil,  China  and  India,  only  a  considerably 
small number of affiliates seem to be performing relevant R&D that goes further beyond adaptive 
R&D  and  only  a  few  of  these  centers  are  integrated  into  the  overall  innovative  strategy  of  the 
multinational  company.  Still,  even  if  R&D  is  integrated  into  global  value  chains,  the  benefits  to 
local society may not be reached if domestic absorptive capacity is low and if there are mechanisms 
that  do  not  permit  the  flows  of  tacit  knowledge  from  those  subsidiaries  to  indigenous  companies, 
affecting the national overall learning process.    

In  order  to  contribute  to  domestic  companies  in  host  countries,  subsidiaries  should  have 
specific  types  of  knowledge  creation  associated  with  investments  in  disembodied  knowledge  and 
human  capital  (Marin  et  al.,  2007).  MNCs  could  have  and  exacerbated  used  of  local  incentives 
provided by local government, generating loss of revenue, slacken of intellectual property laws and 
employment policies socially burdensome (UNCTAD, 2005b).  

Finally,  it  is  important  to  mention  that  attracting  those  investments  is  not  per  se  going  to 
solve  developing  countries’  challenges  to  overcome  underdevelopment.  It  may  be  important  for 
technological catch-up, once positive effect are likely to occur, however it does not mean national 
companies  will  automatically  benefit  from  MNCs’  R&D  activities  performed  in  their  territories. 
Domestic  companies  must  enhance  their  absorptive  capacity  to  benefit  from  external  knowledge 
from MNCs and governments can make efforts to improve their industrial and innovation policies 
in a way to incentivize the dissemination of MNCs expertise locally (Archibugi & Pietrobelli, 2003; 
Filippetti et al., 2017).
