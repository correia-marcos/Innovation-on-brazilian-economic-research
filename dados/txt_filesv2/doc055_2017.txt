Abstract

As the international real rate of interest shows a decreasing path during the last 10 years or
so, I address how optimal monetary policy must conform to this new instance. For that, I (cid:133)rst
identify the way monetary policy in(cid:135)uences the probability of the nominal interest rate hitting
and remaining and the ZLB, by means of the expectations channel. Next, I derive the time-
consistent (unconditionally) optimal monetary policy under commitment to be adopted between
ZLB episodes, when the constraint is occasionally binding, in a standard New-Keynesian model,
and the central bank internalize its role in determining ZLB episodes. My approach allows for
directly retaining precautionary policy behavior even under the log-linearized version of the
model. So, it is easily incorporated into standard business cycle models. Finally, I verify how
optimal policy must be implemented as the natural real rate of interest decreases towards zero.
Results suggest that optimal policy resembles price level targeting at low real interest rates
and low levels of in(cid:135)ation targets (trend in(cid:135)ation). As the in(cid:135)ation target is increased, a more
entangled policy must be implemented, due to the following policy tradeo⁄. Strong responses to
negative demand shocks help output, but increase the probability of hitting the ZLB. Therefore,
more attenuated responses are indicated. Finally, the e⁄ects of increasing the in(cid:135)ation target
are not the same as the ones obtained under higher levels of natural real interest rates.

1 Introduction

As the international long-run real rate of interest shows a decreasing path during the last decades,
recently hitting estimated levels as low as 1% or even smaller (see e.g. Laubach and Williams (2015),
Bauer and Rudebusch (2016) and Yi and Zhang (2016)), I address how optimal monetary policy must
conform to this new instance, in frameworks in which shocks (demand and technology) have continuos
distributions. Here, I contribute for the discussion by assessing the consequences of monetary policy
controlling future probabilities of hitting the zero lower bound (ZLB) in a economy in which the ZLB
constraint is occasionally binding. Moreover, I follow Damjanovic et al. (2008) strategy for deriving
optimal policies under unconditionally commitment, which is unconditionally time-consistent.

I (cid:133)rst identify the way monetary policy in(cid:135)uences the probability of the nominal interest rate
hitting and remaining and the ZLB, by means of the expectations channel. Next, I derive the time-
consistent (unconditionally) optimal monetary policy under commitment to be adopted between
ZLB episodes, when the constraint is occasionally binding, and the central bank internalize its role
in determining ZLB episodes.

An important result is that my results directly internalize precautionary behavior even under the
(cid:133)rst-order approximation of the model. This is an important di⁄erence from my result to similar ones
in the literature, e.g. Eggertsson and Woodford (2003a,b) and Nakov (2008). I obtain a targeting
rule whose form is a direct convex combination between the standard optimal targeting rule obtained
by those authors under usual Kuhn-Tucker optimization, and components capturing precautionary
behavior. The long-run probability of hitting the ZLB works as the combination weight.

I (cid:133)nd that optimal policy resembles price level targeting at low real interest rates and low levels
of in(cid:135)ation targets (trend in(cid:135)ation). Under low levels of nominal interest rates, the optimal targeting
rule becomes even more history dependent and more dependent on past values of the nominal interest
rate. That is, the central bank consciously and directly adopts precautionary behavior in normal
times, not decreasing the rate as much on spot in response to negative demand shocks in order
to create more room for future e⁄ective monetary policy changes. It also takes even longer than
what standard optimal policy (e.g. Nakov (2008)) prescribe to increase the rates after the shocks
have dissipated. This precautionary behavior becomes stronger as the steady state level of nominal
interest rate is reduced.

I also (cid:133)nd that, as the in(cid:135)ation target is increased, a more entangled policy must be implemented,
as the e⁄ects of increasing the in(cid:135)ation target are not the same as the ones obtained under higher
levels of natural real interest rates. As a matter of fact, higher levels of trend in(cid:135)ation also brings
distortions to the economy.

When the monetary authority does not directly internalize its role in a⁄ecting the probability
of hitting the ZLB, as in e.g. Nakov (2008), the functional form of optimal targeting rules during
normal times are the same as the ones obtained in economies where the ZLB is never hit. In this
standard approach, policy precautionary behavior arises only indirectly in general equilibrium, and
so the central bank does not bene(cid:133)t as much.

When comparing welfare-based performances of both types of optimal policies under occasionally
binding ZLB constraint, I (cid:133)nd that the precautionary optimal policy dominates the standard optimal
policy for every level of real interest rates and trend in(cid:135)ation (in(cid:135)ation target).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The model is described in Section 2. Key
results on the probability of hitting the ZLB and the design of the precautionary optimal policy are
derived in Section 3. The e⁄ect of declining real interest rates at di⁄erent levels of trend in(cid:135)ation
on welfare is discussed in Section 5.1, while Section 5.2 assesses how optimal policies perform after
negative demand shocks. Section 6 summarizes the paper(cid:146)s conclusions.

2 The model

For simplicity, I follow Woodford (2003, chap. 4) to describe the standard new-Keynesian model
with Calvo (1983) price setting and (cid:135)exible wages. The economy consists of a representative in(cid:133)nite-
lived household that consumes an aggregate bundle and supplies di⁄erentiated labor to a continuum of
di⁄erentiated (cid:133)rms indexed by z 2 (0; 1), which produce and sell goods in a monopolistic competition
environment.

Household(cid:146)s workers supply ht (z) hours of labor to each (cid:133)rm z, at nominal wage Wt (z) = Ptwt (z),
where Pt is the consumption price index and wt (z) is the real wage. Disutility over hours worked
in each (cid:133)rm is (cid:29)t (z) (cid:17) (cid:31)ht (z)1+(cid:23) = (1 + (cid:23)), where (cid:23)(cid:0)1 is the Frisch elasticity of labor supply. The
household(cid:146)s aggregate disutility function is (cid:29)t (cid:17) R 1

tiated goods is aggregated into a bundle Ct, as in Dixit and Stiglitz (1977), and provides utility

by PtYt = R 1

implies that the (cid:133)rm(cid:146)s demand function is yt (z) = Yt (pt (z) =Pt)(cid:0)(cid:18), where Yt = Ct.
With probability (1 (cid:0) (cid:11)), the (cid:133)rm optimally readjusts its price to pt (z) = p(cid:3)t . With probability
(cid:11), the (cid:133)rm sets its price according to pt (z) = pt(cid:0)1 (z) (cid:5)ind
t(cid:0)1 and (cid:13)(cid:25) 2 (0; 1). When
optimally readjusting at period t, the price p(cid:3)t maximizes the expected discounted (cid:135)ow of nominal

at period t is an endogenous variable. In this regard, monetary policy has an important role, for it

4In the literature on trend in(cid:135)ation, there are two usual ways to describe trend in(cid:135)ation Phillips curves: (i) with
ancillary variables (e.g. Ascari and Ropele (2007)); and (ii) with in(cid:133)te sums (e.g. Cogley and Sbordone (2008) and
Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2011)).

5The composite parameters (cid:22)(cid:11) and # are bounded by max ((cid:22)(cid:11); (cid:22)(cid:11)#) < 1 to guarantee the existence of an equilibrium

with trend in(cid:135)ation.

6As Ascari and Ropele (2007) show, the GNKPC reduces to the usual form when the level of trend in(cid:135)ation is zero.

In this case, the ancillary variable ^$t become irrelevant and the trend in(cid:135)ation cost-push shockbut vanishes to zero.

in(cid:135)ation to rise and have had positive demand shocks.

Assume that the central bank implements in(cid:135)ation targeting by keeping the unconditional mean
of the in(cid:135)ation rate at the central target (cid:22)(cid:25), or E(cid:25)t = (cid:22)(cid:25). When log-linearizing around the in(cid:135)ation
target, E ^(cid:25)t = 0. As for the ZLB constraint It > 1, its log-linearized form is ^{t (cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:23)i, where again
(cid:23)i (cid:17) log(cid:0) (cid:22)I(cid:1) is (cid:0)^{t evaluated at it = 0.
Here, I expand optimal policies results I obtained in Alves (2014) by internalizing the in(cid:135)uence
monetary policy has in gauging po;t when deriving trend in(cid:135)ation optimal policies rules under un-
conditionally commitment (e.g. Damjanovic et al. (2008)), which is unconditionally time-consistent.
That is, there is no inconsistency arising from (cid:133)rst-order conditions obtained at (cid:133)rst periods of
optimization steps. As a consequence, unconditionally, the monetary authority has no incentive to
deviate from the optimal policy rule. I assume that the welfare-concerned central bank minimizes the
unconditional expectation of the Lagrangian problem formed by the discounted sum of the TIWeB
loss function, subject to the IS curve, GNKPC (3), ZLB Probability curve (6), E ^(cid:25)t = 0 and the
constraint ^{t (cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:23)i.

In order to make it easier to derive optimal policies rules under unconditionally commitment, I

use the ancillary variable ^%t and split the IS curve into ^xt = ^%t(cid:0) 1
way are unconditionally time consistent.

(cid:27)^{t + 1

(cid:27) ^rn

Since it is the unconditional expectation which is minimized, optimal policy rules derived this

t and ^%t = Et(cid:0)^xt+1 + 1

(cid:27) ^(cid:25)t+1(cid:1).

(cid:23)i + 1
form, the simplest approach is to directly impose the restricted IS curve ^xt = ^%t + 1
(cid:27)

The use of unconditional expectations allows us to decompose the problem in periods for which
^{t (cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:23)i is biding, with probability po;t, and those in which the restriction is loose, with probability
(1 (cid:0) po;t). When the restriction binds, I simply impose ^{t = (cid:0)(cid:23)i into the IS curve, which is the only
one a⁄ected by the restriction. The remaining equations are not a⁄ected. Analogously, the only
loss function quadratic term a⁄ect by the restriction is (cid:22)X(cid:0)^xt (cid:0) (cid:22)(cid:30)x(cid:1)2. When building the Lagrangian
(cid:22)X(cid:0)^xt (cid:0) (cid:22)(cid:30)x(cid:1)2 when the restriction binds.
In addition, the whole Lagrangian problem must be of order O (2), for this is the order to which
the welfare function is log-approximated. Since log-linearized equations are used as restrictions,
Lagrangian multipliers must be of order O (1). This order issue is relevant when adding the ZLB
Probability curve (6), i.e. (cid:133)rst order approximation of po;t, into the problem. The issue arises
when multiplying this approximation by the second order components from the loss function. We
must disregard all O (3) terms from the resulting multiplication. In Alves (2014), I show that the
distortion parameters (cid:22)(cid:30)(cid:25) and (cid:22)(cid:30)x must be of order O (1) in order for the trend in(cid:135)ation welfare-based
loss function to be properly used with log-linearized equations when deriving optimal policy rules.
With the same logic, I assume that(cid:23)i is of order O (1). This assumption is reasonable once we consider
that any hatted variable is assumed to be of order O (1) and (cid:23)i is (cid:0)^{t evaluated at it = 0.
After taking in consideration the fact that the Lagrangian problem may only have O (3) terms,
I derive the trend in(cid:135)ation optimal policy rules under unconditionally commitment (based on e.g.
Damjanovic et al. (2008)), for the case in which the monetary authority internalizes its in(cid:135)uence over
episodes of occasionally hitting the ZLB on nominal interest rates, as described by proposition 1.8

8In Alves (2014), I (cid:133)nd that the trend in(cid:135)ation optimal policy under unconditionally commitment slightly dominates
the one from timeless perspective, even though both optimal policy rules imply almost indistinguishable dynamics
and unconditional moments. Due to this result, I choose the aproach of deriving optimal policy under unconditionally
commitment to deal with ZLB occasionally binding constraints.

Proposition 1 When a welfare-concerned central bank targets (cid:22)(cid:25) as the in(cid:135)ation target, follows the
recommendations of the TIWeB loss function, and recognizes its role in in(cid:135)uencing occasionally
binding episodes of hitting the zero-lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates, the optimal precau-
tionary policy under unconditionally commitment are described by the following targeting rule, when
the ZLB constraint is not binding:

and the composite parameters are de(cid:133)ned as follows:

The proof follows standard optimization steps, and so is not shown here.
Of course, ^{t ! (cid:0)(cid:23)i when the ZLB constraint binds. Therefore, the full targeting rule must be
understood as the one to be pursued in between occasionally binding episodes when the monetary
authority is internalizes its role of in(cid:135)uencing the probability of hitting the ZLB by means of the
expectations channel. Note that under low steady level of the (gross) nominal interest rate (cid:22)I = (cid:22)(cid:5)=(cid:12),
(cid:22)po and (cid:30)(cid:15) fast increase and the full targeting rule becomes more and more history dependent and more
directly dependent on the history of nominal interest rates. As I (cid:133)nd, the central bank consciously
and directly adopts precautionary behavior in normal times in order not to cut nominal interest
rates so fast after negative demand shocks and taking longer to increase the rate after the shock has
dissipated. And (cid:22)po gauges the optimal degree to which this behavior is to be used.

These terms do not arise when the monetary authority do not directly internalize its role in
a⁄ecting the probability of hitting the ZLB, as in e.g. Eggertsson and Woodford (2003a,b) and Nakov
(2008). In their approach, policy precautionary behavior arises indirectly in general equilibrium, and
so the central bank does not bene(cid:133)t as much.

Recall that (cid:22)po and (cid:30)(cid:15) are direct functions of the steady level of the (gross) nominal interest rate
(cid:22)I = (cid:22)(cid:5)=(cid:12), which can change by either changing the steady state level of (gross) real interest rate
(cid:22)R = 1=(cid:12) or the level of (gross) trend in(cid:135)ation (cid:22)(cid:5). Therefore, the e⁄ects of rising (cid:22)(cid:5) or (cid:22)R are perfectly
substitutes on what regards (cid:22)po and (cid:30)(cid:15). However, the e⁄ects of both margins are di⁄erent on the
targeting rule are very di⁄erent and not substitutes. And so, rising the trend in(cid:135)ation (in(cid:135)ation
target) level is not a perfect remedy to instances in which the real interest rate is falling. That is, it
is not enough to rise the trend in(cid:135)ation target as it wold create more distortions.

The e⁄ects of rising trend in(cid:135)ation on trend in(cid:135)ation composite parameters, such as (cid:22)(cid:11), (cid:22)#, c1, c2,
c3, c4, and (cid:22)(cid:20), do not parallel those obtained by increasing 1=(cid:12). As a matter of fact, rising levels of
trend in(cid:135)ation might create more instability, as shown in the literature of trend in(cid:135)ation.

For larger steady state levels of nominal interest rate, as we used to have in the past, (cid:22)po shrinks
down to zero. Therefore, the rule returns to the trend in(cid:135)ation form obtained in Alves (2014),
(cid:22)X(cid:22)(cid:20) [^xt (cid:0) (cid:12) ^xt(cid:0)1 (cid:0) (c2 (cid:0) c1) ^{1;t(cid:0)1], in which the targeting rule becomes more
history dependent as trend in(cid:135)ation rises. The results obtained by Damjanovic et al. (2008) refer
to the particular case (cid:22)(cid:25) = 0, for which (cid:22)(cid:11) = (cid:11), and (cid:22)# = c1 = c2 = 1. In that case, the targeting

t (cid:1) + (cid:22)X(cid:22)(cid:20) (^xt (cid:0) (cid:12) ^xt(cid:0)1), which that authors
rule under unconditionally commitment is 0 = (cid:0)^(cid:25)t (cid:0) ^(cid:25)ind
show to slightly dominate the Woodford (2003) Timeless perspective targeting rule. The latter has
(^xt (cid:0) ^xt(cid:0)1) instead of (^xt (cid:0) (cid:12) ^xt(cid:0)1) as its last term. As a consequence, Timeless perspective optimal
policy is equivalent to price level targeting, while unconditionally commitment optimal policy is not.
It is easy to verify that the last result is the obtained optimal policy under unconditionally
commitment when expanding Nakov (2008) approach to the trend in(cid:135)ation case. Again, ^{t ! (cid:0)(cid:23)i
when the ZLB constraint binds. Note that this policy rule does not directly internalize policy
precautionary behavior (cid:150)it does under general equilibrium, however. Therefore, I call this targeting
rule the Standard Optimal Policy under occasionally binding ZLB constraint, in order to distinguish
it from the Precautionary Optimal Policy (8) under occasionally binding ZLB constraint.

If (cid:22)(cid:25) = 0 and the economy has low levels of nominal interest rates, (cid:22)po fast increase and so the
precautionary targeting rule becomes even more history dependent and more directly dependents on
the history of nominal interest rates:

Consider the case in which the (gross) real interest rate (cid:22)R = 1=(cid:12) has been reducing over time,
i.e. (cid:12) is approaching closer and closer to unity. In this case, (1 (cid:0) L) is a good approximation for
(1 (cid:0) (cid:12)L). Moreover, empirical microevidence strongly suggests that there is none or very small degree
of price stickiness in the US, i.e. (cid:13)(cid:25) is very small. Since ^(cid:25)t = (1 (cid:0) L) ^pt and ^(cid:25)ind
, for
t = (cid:13)(cid:25) ^pt(cid:0)1, the targeting rule is reasonably approximated by the following expression when (cid:22)R is
^pind
small:

t = (1 (cid:0) L) ^pind

t

(cid:22)X(cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:2) (cid:22)(cid:20)
(cid:27)^{t(cid:1)

Since macroevidence suggests that (cid:27) >> (cid:22)(cid:20), i.e. (cid:22)(cid:20)

(cid:27) is very small, the second term dominates the
expression inside brackets. We then follow to "divide" the expression by (1 (cid:0) L), and obtain the
simpli(cid:133)cation:
(10)

0 (cid:25)(cid:0)^pt (cid:0) ^pind

t (cid:1) + (1 (cid:0) (cid:22)po) (cid:22)X(cid:22)(cid:20) ^xt + (cid:22)po

(cid:22)X(cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:0)^xt(cid:0)1 + 1

(cid:27)^{t(cid:0)1(cid:1)

That is, under low levels of steady state real interest rate, a central bank who internalizes its role
in in(cid:135)uencing the probability of hitting the ZLB would implement monetary policy according to a
optimal (unconditionally) time-consistent policy rule that closely resembles price level targeting.

In order to understand the e⁄ect of monetary policy internalizing its in(cid:135)uence over the probability
po;t of hitting the zero lower bound, suppose that the economy was hit by a negative demand shock.
Under negligible values of (cid:22)po, the standard result is that monetary policy lowers the rate in order

to compensate the fall in current output gap so that (cid:0)^pt (cid:0) ^pind

remain stable and monetary policy pursues price level targeting.

t (cid:1) remains equal to zero, i.e. prices

Under non-negligible steady state probability (cid:22)po, current probability ^po;t of hitting the ZLB rises
by means of the ZLB Probability curve (6). Monetary policy now also look further into the past
history of output gap and nominal interest rates. As a consequence, monetary policy does not react

as strong on impact, for it also looks into periods in which the output gap was not yet hit by the
shock. This slow down in reducing the rate makes more room for monetary policy to avoid hitting the
ZLB. On the other hand, after the negative demand shock has dissipated, monetary policy continues
to look longer in the past and still take in consideration that the output gap has fallen in the past.
Therefore, nominal rates take longer to return. I highlight that this duration depends on (cid:22)po. Hence,
forward guidance is always optimized under this policy rule.

Finally, the presence of ^{t(cid:0)1 in the targeting rule is a novelty in the literature of optimal policy
prescriptions. It naturally arises as (cid:22)po rises and it serves to smooth optimal changes on nominal
interest rates. As a consequence, the rate does not fall (rise) as fast under negative (positive)
demand shocks when compared to responses under standard optimal policy prescriptions such as in
Damjanovic et al. (2008), Woodford (2003),and Nakov (2008).

Addressing the case under larger values of trend in(cid:135)ation (cid:22)(cid:25), under low real interest rates, is more
entangled. The targeting rules does not resembles price level targeting anymore. In this case, only
numerical analyses are feasible.

to hours at the production function at " = 0:64. As in ,Coibion et al. (2012), I set the elasticity
of substitution at (cid:30) = 7, which implies a steady state price markup of (cid:22) = 1:17.9 Recall that the
iid(cid:24) N (0; s2
a).
Using the central estimate obtained by Smets and Wouters (2007) for the larger sample, I set the
autoregressive coe¢ cient of the technology shock at (cid:26)a = 0:95 and the shock(cid:146)s standard deviation
at sa = 0:0045. The remaining parameters were based on central estimates obtained by Smets and
Wouters (2007), for the Great Moderation.
I set the reciprocal of the intertemporal elasticity of
substitution at (cid:27) = 1:47. As for the elasticity (cid:23) of the disutility from hours ht (z), i.e. the reciprocal
of the Frisch elasticity, I use (cid:23) = 2:30. Note that this value is consistent with micro evidence, as
reported by Chetty et al. (2011).10 I set the degree of price stickiness at (cid:11) = 0:73, while the price
indexation parameter is (cid:133)xed at (cid:13)(cid:25) = 0:21. In addition, I set the disutility nuisance parameter at
(cid:31) = 1.

Recall that the (log-deviation) demand shock evolves according to ^(cid:15)t = (cid:26)u^(cid:15)t(cid:0)1 + ^(cid:15)u;t, where ^(cid:15)u;t

iid(cid:24)
u), and that I do not assume consumtion habit persistence in my model. Therefore, (cid:26)u will
N (0; s2
play a similar role as the degree of habit persistence in this model. Therefore, based on the authors(cid:146)
estimated habit persistence parameter, I set the persistence of the demand shock (cid:26) = 0:68. In order
to adjust the implied dynamics implied by this assumption, I estimate su using quarterly US data
from the Great Moderation period 1985:Q1-2005:Q4. For that, I (cid:133)x (cid:12) = 0:995 (consistent with annual
real interest rate (cid:22)r = 2%) and (annual) (cid:22)(cid:25) = 3:05% (consistent with the sample average of the CPI
in(cid:135)ation rate).

For estimation, I considered the following observed variables: (i) in(cid:135)ation rate ^(cid:25)t is the (log) BLS
CPI in(cid:135)ation rate (US city average, all urban consumers), demeaned from its sample average; (ii)
output ^yt is the (log) BLS GDP, detrended by its linear trend; and (iii) nominal interest rate ^{t is
the (log) quarterly average of the Federal Funds Rate, demeaned from its sample average.

Since I observe the nominal interest rate in the estimation, I assume that monetary policy followed

a simplifyed Trend In(cid:135)ation Taylor rule, based on Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2011):

^{t = (cid:30)i^{t(cid:0)1 + (1 (cid:0) (cid:30)i)(cid:2)(cid:30)(cid:25)Et^(cid:25)t+1 + (cid:30)x ^xt + (cid:30)gy (^yt (cid:0) ^yt(cid:0)1)(cid:3) + ^(cid:15)i;t

9For instance, Ravenna and Walsh (2008, 2011) set the steady state price markup to 1:2.

i ) is the monetary policy shock, (cid:30)i is the policy smoothing parameter, and (cid:30)(cid:25),
where ^(cid:15)i;t
(cid:30)x and (cid:30)gy are response parameters consistent with stability and determinacy in equilibria with
rational expectations in a equilibrium with positive trend in(cid:135)ation. The authors (cid:133)nd that reacting
to the observed output growth has two major advantages: (i) it has more stabilizing properties
when the trend in(cid:135)ation is not zero; and (ii) it is empirically more relevant. Based on Coibion and
Gorodnichenko (2011) central estimations, I keep (cid:30)i = 0:92 and estimate the response parameters
so that the estimated model adjusts to a possible misscalibration and absence of additional shocks.
Since I am focused in inferring su and sa, this strategy is fairy reasonable.

Using Bayesian MCMC estimation, with (cid:135)at priors and 200000 draws, table 1 reports posterior
means and 95% credible intervals for (cid:30)(cid:25), (cid:30)x, (cid:30)gy, si, and su. For simulations shown in Section 5, I
set su and sa at the posterior means. Since all exercises are focused on optimal policy rules, I did
not consider outcomes under monetary policy shocks.

Using the calibration set, note that the steady-state levels of the ZLB probability (cid:22)po and probability-
elasticity of shocks (cid:30)(cid:15) increase very fast as the steady state level of the annual nominal interest rate
(cid:22){ falls towards the ZLB, as depicted in Figure 1. I highlight the fact that (cid:22)po is reference level, for the
expected frequency Epo;t according to which the ZLB binds is highly policy-dependent. In Section
5, I show simulations under di⁄erent monetary policy frameworks.

Figure 1: ZLB Probability and Probability-Elasticity

For instance, the observed frequency at which the e⁄ective annualized Federal Funds rate is
below 0.15%, which I call the E⁄ective Lower Bound (ELB), from 2006Q1 to 2016Q4 (after the
Great Moderation period) was 41%. During this period, the average Fed Funds rate was 1:19%. In
this context, even though (cid:22)po = 32%, the Standard Optimal policy delivers Epo;t between 43% and
44% depending on the combination of (cid:12) and (cid:22)(cid:25) such that (cid:22){ = 1:19. In a similar exercise, for the larger
sample 1985Q1 to 2016Q4, the average Fed Funds rate was 3:73% and the rate was below the ELB
at 14% of the time. In this context, (cid:22)po = 7:5% and Epo;t ranges between 14% and 16%, depending
on the combination of (cid:12) and (cid:22)(cid:25) such that (cid:22){ = 3:73.

This section studies the welfare gains and dynamics implied by trend in(cid:135)ation optimal policies
under unconditionally commitment. I perform simulations using Occbin, by Guerrieri and Iacoviello
(2015), to account for the occasionally biding ZLB constraint on the nominal interest rate. Due to
ZLB restrictions, there is no closed form solution to compute the model(cid:146)s unconditional moments.
Therefore, in order to infer them, I simulate arti(cid:133)cial equilibria with 10,000 periods simultaneously
using (cid:133)xed sequences of exogenous demand and technology shocks, based on the distribution detailed
in the last section.

In the (cid:133)rst exercise, I compute welfare gains from using the TIWeB precautionary optimal policy
under unconditionally commitment (PrOP) over the TIWeB standard optimal policy under uncon-
ditionally commitment (StOP), obtained by extending the Nakov (2008) analysis to a trend in(cid:135)ation
economy, and estimated TTrend In(cid:135)ation Taylor Rule (TayR). I do not compare with the Trend
In(cid:135)ation optimal policy under discretion, which I derive in Alves (2014), for it is only compatible
with stability and determinacy at very small levels of trend in(cid:135)ation (see Alves (2014) for more
details). In the second exercise, I compare impulse responses to negative demand shocks obtained
under di⁄erent policy frameworks.

5.1 Policy evaluation

As for studying the welfare gains, I follow Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2007) and Alves (2014) by
computing welfare cost rates, in terms of consumption equivalence results, of each optimal monetary
policy framework. The analysis is done in terms of assessing the gains from commitment as trend
in(cid:135)ation rises from 0 percent to 2 percent.11, paralleling the exercises done by Ascari and Ropele
(2007).

I assess the gains from using the PrOP optimal policy under unconditionally commitment against
the alternative StOP optimal policy under unconditionally commitment, considering the welfare cost
rate (cid:21) of adopting each speci(cid:133)c policy framework. In order to simplify the evaluation, I consider
the TIWeB loss function to compute the unconditional expected value of the second order log-
approximation of the welfare function, under occasionally biding ZLB restrictions, EWt (cid:25) (cid:22)W (cid:0)
ti. Note that the
(cid:22)V(1(cid:0)(cid:12))E (cid:22)Lt, where E (cid:22)Lt = V ar(cid:0)^(cid:25)t (cid:0) ^(cid:25)ind

term inside brackets might be relevant as occasionally biding ZLB restrictions induces non-zero values
for E(cid:0)^(cid:25)t (cid:0) ^(cid:25)ind

The welfare cost rate (cid:21) is interpreted as a tax rate that must be applied to the steady state output
level (cid:22)Y 0 under the equilibrium with (cid:135)exible prices ((cid:22)(cid:25) = 0) in order to the representative household
to be indi⁄erent between this equilibrium and a stochastic one with non-zero trend in(cid:135)ation and
occasionally binding ZLB constraints over the nominal interest rate:

Tables 2 and 3 report welfare cost rates (cid:21), for di⁄erent optimal policy frameworks and di⁄erent
levels of (annual) real interest rates, (cid:22)r = 2% and (cid:22)r = 1%, as trend in(cid:135)ation rises from (cid:22)(cid:25) = 0% to (cid:22)(cid:25) =
2%. The compared policy structures are TIWeB precautionary unconditional commitment (PrOP),
TIWeB standard unconditional commitment (StOP) and TI Taylor Rule (TayR). For benchmark

11If nominal interest rates were allowed to be negative, optimal monetary policy under unconditionally commitment
would fully stabilize the economy under zero trend in(cid:135)ation, and the model would not be disturbed by exogenous
shocks. The reason is that the endogenous trend in(cid:135)ation cost push shock is zero at this level of trend in(cid:135)ation. If
the ZLB is occasionally binding, on the other hand, optimal policy fails to always stabilize the economy. In this case,
even at zero trend in(cid:135)ation, the uconditional variances of in(cid:135)ation and output gap are not simultaneously zero.

purposes, the tables also show the outcome in the (cid:133)cticious economy where the ZLB constraint is
not at play.

The tables also compare steady state levels (cid:22)po of the probability of hitting the ZLB with average
probabilities Epo;t obtained under di⁄erent policy rules. Two lessons are learned from the tables:

(i) if the ZLB constraint occasionally binds, relative gains from precautionary (PrOP) optimal com-
mitment over standard (StOP) optimal commitment increase as trend in(cid:135)ation rises and the real
interest rate falls; (ii) in the (cid:133)cticious economy where the ZLB constraint is not at play, even though
I obtain the expected result that the StOP optimal policy always dominates, the losses from adoting
the PrOP optimal policy are negligible; (iii) the PrOP optimal policy delivers larger probabilities of
hitting the ZLB, as it (cid:133)nds it optimal to remaining longer at the ZLB even after large negative shocks
have dissipated (see Section 5.2); (iv) even though the taylor Rule delivers much smaller probabilities
of hitting the ZLB, its implyied losses are much larger than those of both optimal policies.

5.2 Impulse Responses

In order to clearly illustrate the role of a precautionary optimal policy under unconditionally
commitment, Figures 2 and 3 depict responses after a one-period (t = 2) negative demand innovation
shocks, with amplitudes varying from (cid:15)u;t = (cid:0) (0:5) su to (cid:15)u;t = (cid:0) (5:0) su, where again su is the
estimated standard deviation of the demand shock. In all simulations, I consider (cid:22)r = 1% and trend
in(cid:135)ation (cid:133)xed at (cid:22)(cid:25) = 2%. Figures 4 and 5 depict the responses after two-periods negative demand
shocks.

(cid:22)(cid:5).

t = Rn
t

At those levels, there are distinct responses di⁄erences under the precautionary and standard
optimal policy rules. In each exercise, I compare the responses obtained under the Precautionary
Optimal Policy (8), Standard Optimal Policy, estimated Trend In(cid:135)ation Taylor Rule (11) and under
the Equilibrium with Flexible Prices without ZLB constraints. In this equilibrium, I assume that the
nominal interest rate adjusts in order to keep the nominal interest rate constant at (cid:22)(cid:25) = 2%, given
the path of the real interest rate, i.e. I n

The (cid:133)gures depict the responses of output ^Yt, annualized in(cid:135)ation rate (cid:25)t, annualized nominal
interest rate it and the expected probability of hitting the ZLB in the next period Etpo;t+1. Six lessons
are learned from the responses: (i) output losses and in(cid:135)ation falls are smaller under precautionary
(PrOP) optimal commitment over standard (StOP) optimal commitment and Taylor Rule; (ii) the
PrOP policy delays the reduction in the nominal interest rate as the shock hits, making more room
for policy e⁄ectiveness, and delays even further the nominal rate return to normal levels after the
shock dissipates; (iii) in line with the conclusions obtained in the analyses from the last section, the
PrOP optimal policy deliver larger probabilities of hitting the ZLB, as it (cid:133)nds it optimal to remaining
longer at the ZLB even after the negative shocks have dissipated; (iv) when not binded, the interest
rate response under the PrOP policy tends to mimic that of the nominal interest rate under the
equilibrium with (cid:135)exible prices; (v) even though the Taylor Rule generates very low probability of
hitting the ZLB, it generates costs in terms of larger declines in output and in(cid:135)ation when compared
to the PrOP optimal policy; (vi) under large enough negative demand shocks, the Taylor Rule starts
to dominate the StOP optimal policy.

The second and third lessons characterizes the precautionary nature of PrOP policies. In this
exercise, the resulting optimal forward guidance structure depends on the size of the negative shock.
For small shocks, which prevents the ZLB to actually bind, both optimal policy frameworks deliver
very similar results in terms of output and in(cid:135)ation. Indeed, they virtually succeed in bringing price
stability. For larger negative shocks, the di⁄erences become very clear, as the precautionary nature
of PrOP dominates.

6 Conclusions

I derive a precautionary optimal policy under unconditionally commitment and occasionally
binding ZLB constraint on the nominal interest rate, for a standard New Keynesian model with
continously-distributed demand and technology shocks.
I depart from the literature by directly
considering the unconditional probabilities of hitting the ZLB constraint and avoiding the issue of
modelling transition probabilities of entering and leaving binding states.

The optimal policy directly internalizes a precautionary behavior arising at occasionally binding
ZLB constraint. My approach allows for keeping the direct precautionary behavior even under the
(cid:133)rst-order (loglinearization) approximation of the model equilibrium.

Finally, I show that the precautionary optimal policy dominates, in welfare terms, the standard
optimal policy occasionally binding ZLB constraints (see e.g. Nakov (2008)). In addition, I (cid:133)nd
that optimal precautionary responses to negative demand shocks induces a slower reduction in the
nominal rate as the shock hits, making more room implementing monetary policy in the future. As
the negative shock dissipates, optimal precautionary policy takes longer to return the rate to normal
values than what the standard optimal policy prescribes. As a consequence, optimal precautionary
policy induces the probability of hitting the ZLB to be higher than what the standard optimal policy
implies.
