Abstract 

This  paper  aims  to  explain  how  Brazilian  environmental  vulnerability  can  affect  its  industrial 
competitiveness in a scenario where the European Union would adopt BCAs. A modified version of the 
GTAP-E (Global Trade Analysis Project – Energy) model is used here to simulate the application by the 
EU  of  BCAs  to  carbon-intensive  products  that  come  from  countries  which  do  not  carry  out  similar 
policies to mitigate CO2 emissions. A novelty in the present analysis is that the model takes into account 
the industrial process emissions of three main sectors (chemicals, iron &steel and non-metallic minerals), 
as  well  as  the  indirect  costs  associated  with  carbon  taxes  levied  on  the  energy  industries  (the  induced 
increase of electricity and gas prices). The main results suggest that BCAs are an effective instrument in 
curbing  carbon  leakage,  especially  when  industrial  process  emissions  are  taken  into  account.  Regarding 
Brazilian  industrial  competitiveness,  BCAs  would  negatively  affect  some  sectors’  exports  to  the  EU, 
namely  non-metallic  minerals  and  iron  &  steel.  When  it  comes  to  the  other  BRICS,  Brazil  would  lose 
competitiveness relative to China and India in the iron & steel sector.

Resumo 

O  objetivo  deste  artigo  é  explicar  como  a  vulnerabilidade  ambiental  brasileira  pode  afetar  a 
competitividade da sua indústria brasileira em um cenário no qual a União Europeia (EU) venha adotar 
BCAs (Border Carbon Adjustments, na sigla em inglês). Foi utilizada uma versão modificada do modelo 
GTAP-E  (Global  Trade  Analysis  Project  –  Energy)  para  simular  a  aplicação  de  BCAs  pela  UE  aos 
produtos  intensivos  em  emissão  de  CO2  importados  de  países  que  não  adotam  políticas  similares  de 
abatimento de emissão de CO2. A inovação na presente análise é que o modelo leva em consideração as 
emissões  geradas  pelos  processos  industriais  de  três  principais  setores  (químico,  ferro  e  aço  e  minerais 
não  metálicos), assim como os custos indiretos relacionados com os  impostos de carbono aplicados nas 
indústrias  de  energia  (o  aumento  induzido  nos  preços  do  gás  e  eletricidade).  Os  principais  resultados 
apontam que os BCAs são instrumentos efetivos para reduzir o escape de carbono, especialmente quando 
as  emissões  dos  processos  industriais  são  levadas  em  conta.  No  que  diz  respeito  à  competitividade  da 
indústria  brasileira,  os  BCAs  afetariam  negativamente  a  exportação  de  alguns  setores  para  a  UE, 
principalmente  os  de  minerais  não  metálicos  e  de  ferro  e  aço.  No  que  se  refere  aos  BRICS,  o  Brasil 
perderia competitividade para China e Índia no setor de ferro e aço.

1. Introduction  

It’s well known that  the  unilateral  or sub-global  adoption of environmental  policies to 
curb climate change can create carbon emission leakage to non-adopting countries3, and 
can also decrease the adopting countries’ foreign trade competitive advantages vis-à-vis 
the non-adhering emerging economies.4 In order to restore the competitive equilibrium 
and  to  reduce  carbon  leakage,  some  policy  instruments  have  been  proposed.5Among 
them,  Border  Carbon  Adjustments  (BCAs)6 have  been  gaining  prominence  since  the 
mechanism  was  incorporated  into  the  Waxman/Markey  bill  –  “The  American  Clean 
Energy and Security Act”.7 Likewise, this instrument has also gained ground in Europe 
as  an  option  in  the  absence  of  a  major  international  agreement  to  cap  greenhouse  gas 
(GHG)8 emissions.9In this context, border adjustment measures are mentioned in the EU 
ETS  Directive  in  paragraph  25  describing  a  system  in  which  importers  would  need  to 
surrender  allowances  and  that  any  action  taken  should  comply  with  the  UNFCCC 
principles,  especially  the  principle  of  common  but  differentiated  responsibilities  and 
respective capabilities as well as with international obligations of the EU, including the 
obligations under WTO agreement.10 

Despite the fact that BCAs have been theoretically assessed as an attractive instrument 
to  improve  the  global  cost-effectiveness  of  the  unilateral  abatement  emissions  and  to 
avoid  the  leakage11,  it’s  still  a  second-best  policy.  Indeed,  the  first-best  would  be  the 
commitment  of  the  countries  subjected  to  such  tariffs  to  reduce  their  own  emissions, 
since the abatement  costs tend to  be significantly lower in  countries where there is  no 
emission control. Among BCAs limitations, one can mention: i) they can be challenged 
by the World Trade Organization (WTO)12; ii) non-adopting countries can impose trade 
sanctions  in  response  to  carbon  tariffs;  and  iii)  their  effectiveness  can  be  considerably 
reduced once exporting countries can manage to find alternative unregulated importing 
markets to sell their carbon-intensive products.13 

Additionally,  imposing  BCAs  on  developing  countries  is  a  way  of  transferring  a 
significant  part  of  the  coalition  countries’  costs  of  abatement  to  non-abating  countries 
(burden-shifting  effects)  and, 
in  assuming 

the  EU  pioneering  role

5The  main  anti-leakage  policy  measures  are  Border  Carbon  Adjustments  (BCAs),  industry  exemptions 
and output-based allowance allocation. A full BCA combines import tariffs with rebates to exporters. For 
more, see Hoel, 1996; OECD, 2006; Quirion, 2009; Monjon and Quirion, 2010.  
6 Border Carbon Adjustment measures can take two forms: carbon tariffs and a mandatory requirement 
for importers to hold emissions allowances. In the first case, the object of our study, the BCAs work as 
embodied  carbon  tariffs  that  are  applied  in  imports  from  countries  without  similar  environmental 
taxation. 
7The  Waxman-Markey  bill  proposes  that  the  US  introduces  a  cap-and-trade  scheme.  The  aim  is  to 
achieve a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (considering 2005 emissions level). 
8 This paper uses the terms “GHG emissions” and “CO2 emissions” as synonyms, despite the fact that the 
former includes the release of other gases, such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). 
9 Actually, the idea of applying BCAs was first floated in EU in response to the US withdrawal from the 
Kyoto Protocol (Zhang, 2012, p.31).

environmental  costs  in  order  to  get  subsequent  cooperation  can  be  questioned. 
Böhringer  et  al.  (2012)  state  that  BCAs  “fare  poorly  when  our  welfare  measures 
account for even a modest degree of inequality-aversion and there is no mechanism in 
place to compensate losers under the border-tax-adjustment regime” (p.209).  

But  while  the  international  trade  community  is  dealing  with  these  environmental 
dilemmas,  Brazil’s  industry  is  struggling  to  maintain  its  export  share  in  the  global 
market,  especially  regarding  high  value  added  and  technological  products  (Coutinho, 
1997;  Gonçalves,  2001;  Laplane  and  Sarti,  2006).  The  fact  is  that  Brazilian  industry 
lacks competitiveness, and despite the fact that a process of trade liberalization started 
in the 1980s, Brazil is still one of the most closed countries in the world when it comes 
to  international  trade, 14  situated  far  behind  the  other  economies  of  the  so-called 
BRICS.15 According to Canuto et al. (2015), this “closedness” to trade is at the core of 
the  Brazilian  industry’s  lack  of  dynamism,  and  “opening  up  and  moving  towards 
integration  into  global  value  chains  could  produce  efficiency  gains  and  help  Brazil 
address its productivity and competitiveness challenges, which have recently come into 
sharper focus” (p.12). 

IMF  (2009)  forecasts  put  China,  India  and  Brazil  among  the  top  five  largest  world 
economies in 2050 thereby also placing them among the main GHG emitters – in 2008, 
their emissions represented 31% of the global energy use and 35% of the CO2 emissions 
from fuel combustion (IEA, 2008). Brazil is an important contributor to climate change 
due  to  its  emissions  derived  from  land-use  changes,  and  the  expansion  of  agricultural 
frontiers,  mainly  in  the  Amazon  region,  is  considered  the  main  source  of  CO2 
emissions.16 Nowadays, the Brazilian energy sector is the third largest GHG emitter in 
the country, mainly because hydropower and renewable biomass still play an important 
role  as  energy  suppliers.  But,  there  are  those  who  believe  this  can  change  in  the  near 
future.  According  to  La  Rovere  et  al.  (2013),  if  additional  mitigation  actions  aren’t 
taken,  emissions  derived  from  the  energy  sector  will  increase,  mostly  because  of 
population and economic growth.17 

Taking this into account, it’s reasonable to wonder how the EU’s potential adoption of 
BCA  measures  would  affect  Brazilian  industry  and  its  competitiveness,  especially 
regarding  its  energy-intensive  sectors.  Similar  analyses  have  been  done  for  China  and 
India 18, but to the best of our knowledge not yet for Brazil.  For the Brazilian economy, 
revealing the role of its environmental vulnerability can bring a more strategic stance to 
industrial  development  and  the  adoption  of  (environmental)  measures  that  could 
minimize the potential losses in foreign trade. 

This  paper  aims  to  explain  how  Brazilian  environmental  vulnerability  can  affect  its 
industrial competitiveness in a scenario where the European Union would adopt BCAs. 
More specifically, it attempts to answer the following questions: i) would a BCA be an

imports  in  the  GPD)  put  Brazil,  in  2012,  as  the  second  most  closed  country  in  the  world,  among  179 
nations. First position was held by Sudan.

Rovere et al., 2013). 
17From  1990  to  2005,  the  GHG  emissions  derived  from  energy  use  and  industrial  processes  increased 
68% and 39%, respectively, resulting together in an 18% share among the other sources(BRASIL, 2009).

effective tool in avoiding or diminishing carbon leakage? ii) will Brazilian foreign trade 
competitiveness be affected by the border carbon adjustments? iii) how will the BCAs 
affect  the  competitiveness  of  the  Brazilian  energy-intensive  and  trade-exposed  sectors 
vis-à-vis those of the other BRICS? 

A modified version of the GTAP-E model is used here to simulate the application by the 
EU of BCAs to carbon-intensive products that come from countries which do not carry 
out similar policies to mitigate CO2 emissions. A novelty in the present analysis is that 
the  model  takes  into  account  industrial  process  emissions  of  three  main  sectors 
(chemicals,  iron  &steel  and  non-metallic  minerals),  as  well  as  the  indirect  costs 
associated  with  carbon  taxes  levied  on  energy  industries  (the  induced  increase  of 
electricity and gas prices).  

The  main  results  suggest  that  BCAs  are  an  effective  instrument  in  curbing  carbon 
leakage, especially when industrial process emissions are taken into account. Regarding 
Brazilian  industry  competitiveness,  BCAs  would  negatively  affect  some  sectors’ 
exports  to  EU,  namely  non-metallic  minerals,  iron  &  steel  and  non-ferrous  metals. 
When it comes to the other BRICS, Brazil would lose competitiveness relative to China 
and India in the iron & steel sector. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of 
Brazilian  industry  evolution  as  well  as  a  description  of  the  most  emission-intensive 
industrial  sectors  and  their  mitigation  potential.  Section  3  presents  a  non-technical 
description  of  the  GTAP-E  model  and  its  main  modifications  for  the  present  study. 
Section 4 presents the results and conclusions are laid out in Section 5. 

 

 

2. The main Brazilian industrial process CO2 emitters  

As  a  whole,  Brazilian  industrial  energy  consumption  is  largely  based  on  renewable 
resources  –  electricity 19 (20.5%),  sugar  cane  bagasse  (19.5%),  firewood  (8.7%)  and 
charcoal  (4.1%)  (MME-BEN,  2015). 20  However,  some  sectors  still  generate 
considerable CO2 emissions. According to the GTAP database, the Brazilian industrial 
sectors  that  combine  intensive  CO2  emissions  and  a  high  level  of  international  trade 
exposure are non-ferrous metals, non-metallic minerals, iron & steel, petroleum & coke, 
iron ore, oil and chemicals (Table 1). 

Bednar-Friedl  et  al.  (2012)  state  that  “while  the  lion’s  share  of  carbon  dioxide 
emissions  arises  in  fossil  fuel  combustion,  some  10%  of  global  production  CO2 
emissions are related to industrial processes. 10% might seem negligible, but it is not in 
the  analysis  of  carbon  leakage  (…)”(p.  168).    And  this  is  because  process  emissions 
mainly  arise  from  three  sectors  that  are  export-oriented  and  under  heavy  international 
competition – iron & steel, clinker and chemicals. In many countries, process emissions 
account  for  approximately  half  of  CO2  emissions  in  the  iron  &  steel  and  cement 
industries, and for a fifth in the chemical sector. The three sectors that not only generate

Due  to  government  policies  for  the  promotion  of  infrastructure  along  with  the 
automobile  sector,  the  iron  &  steel  industry  quickly  expanded  during  the  1970’s.  To 
produce iron and steel, the industry uses pyrometallurgical, electrolytic and mechanical 
processes. The two main production routes are the reduction of iron ore and scrap iron 
in  blast  furnaces  (by  burning  coke  or  coal),  and  the  direct  reduction  in  electric  ovens. 
The pig iron production (coke plant, sintering and blast furnace) consumes 60 to 70% of 
the total energy consumed in integrated plants, mainly due to coke usage as a reducing 
agent.  In  Brazil,  the  main  production  process  input  is  mineral  coal  coke,  which 
represented  about  45%  of  the  energy  consumption  in  2013  (Table  2)  (BEN,  2015). 
Other  important  inputs  are  vegetal  coal  (18.6%),  electricity  (10.4%),  and  natural  gas 
(6.3%). Total energy consumption in this sector has systematically gone up throughout 

                                                           
21 Bednar-Friedlet al. (2012, p.170) demonstrate that these three sectors, together, account for almost 
all of the CO2 emissions derived from industrial processes.

the  years  following  the  production  increase. 22  However,  the  so-called  specific 
consumption  (consumption/production)  has  remained  relatively  steady,  which  denotes 
no  technological  improvements  towards  a  better  energy  efficiency  level  (Henriques 
Júnior, 2010).  

Similarly  to  the  iron  &  steel  industry,  the  cement  sector  largely  benefited  from  the 
extraordinary  Brazilian  economic  growth  during  the  1970s,  which  boosted  the 
construction  industry.  The  cement  industry  is  a  significant  contributor  to  GHG 
emissions because CO2 is a natural byproduct of  the chemical  process  used to  convert 
limestone into clinker, the primary ingredient of cement. In Brazil, the energy demand 
of  the  cement  industry  has  followed  production,  but  the  type  of  energy  used  has 
changed  over  the  years.23 During  the  1970s,  fuel  oil  was  the  main  source  of  energy 
(around 90%). In the following decade, the industry started to use mineral coal (around 
45%),  and  from  1990  on,  petroleum  coke.  Nowadays,  this  energy  input  accounts  for 
about  70%  of  total  demand,  followed  by  electricity  use  (13.2%). 24  Regarding  CO2 
emissions,  from  1990  to  2005  the  amount  of  carbon  dioxide  emitted  by  this  sector 
increased by around 30% (MCT, 2010).

When  it  comes  to  the  chemical  industry,  Brazil  is  among  the  ten  largest  world 
producers, in a group lead by the USA followed by China and Japan. As in the case of 
the previous two sectors, the Brazilian chemical industry has been changing its energy 
consumption profile over the  years. During the 1970s, fuel  oil was the main  source of 
energy  (70%  in  1976).  Over  the  next  decade,  firewood,  coal  and  electricity  gradually 
started to be used. In recent years, natural gas (29.2% in 2013), electricity (28.1%) and 
other  secondary  oil  sources  have  been  substituted  for  other  energetic  inputs  (BEN, 
2015). Concerning the energy consumption level, this industry ranks fourth (6,986 x 103 
toe  in  2013)  on  the  list  of  the  most  energy-intensive  sectors  in  Brazil,  since  some 
specific  segments  such  as  petrochemical,  fertilizers  and  chlor-alkali are  highly  energy

industry’s energy consumption.

2.1. Challenges and opportunities for a “green” transition 

In  Brazil,  when  it  comes  to  emissions  mitigation,  forests  and  land-use  tend  to  occupy 
the  center  of  the  discussions.  However,  as  shown  before,  industry  plays  an  important 
role  in  this  context,  especially  because  of  its  intensive  use  of  fossil  fuels.  And 
particularly regarding the aforementioned  sectors (whose emission levels derived from 
their  production  processes  are  considerably  high),  one  can  say  that  they  represent 
Brazilian biggest challenges in the field, but also offer the main opportunities.  

The  main  challenge  for  Brazilian  industry  is  to  build  a  sustainable  future  combining 
good levels of productivity and competitiveness, without succumbing to cheaper energy 
sources that can, in the end, increase CO2 emissions. The problem is that, as mentioned 
before, Brazil is still one of the most closed nations in the world, even when compared 
to  the  other  BRICS  countries.25And  its  economic  structure,  reliant  on  domestic  value 
chain  integration,  makes  it  difficult  for  the  industry  to  incorporate  cleaner  and  more 
efficient production technologies.26 

The  good  news  is  that  given  the  production  processes  diversity,  there  are  many 
technical  possibilities  for  reducing  energy  consumption  and  emissions.  This  can  be 
achieved,  for  example,  through  the  implementation  of  energy  efficiency  projects,  the 
increase  in  the  use  of  cleaner  energy  sources  (such  as  natural  gas  and  charcoal 
originated from planted forests), and through switches in production technology.27 

In  this  sense,  the  use  of  modern,  higher-yield  burners  and  their  proper  regulation  can 
reduce the heat loss significantly. Besides that, heat recovery processes can be applied 
to  several  industrial  segments  and,  according  to  Worrel  et  al.  (2009),  can  generate 
savings  up  to  40%.  Henriques  Júnior  (2010)  states  that  among  the  aforesaid  industrial 
sectors,  iron-steel  is  the  one  which  presents  the  greatest  potential  to  reduce  emissions 
(44%),  given  its  high  consumption  of  fossil  fuels  and  charcoal  derived  from 
deforestation.28 

Unfortunately,  in  many  cases,  the  wide  variety  of  technical  solutions  available  to 
decrease  GHG  emissions  is  not  enough  to  overcome  the  barriers.  In  Brazil,  industrial 
sectors  have  to  deal,  for  example,  with  the  absence  of  a  widespread  natural  gas 

                                                           
25Brazil’s trade penetration is around 27%, against at least 50% for the other BRICS countries (Canuto et 
al., 2015). 
26 It no coincidence that Brazil presents, among the BRICS, the highest share of processes emissions in 
the total of the CO2 released by their respective industries. According to the United Nations Framework 
Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  database,  processes  emissions  in  Brazil  account  for  around 
17%  of  its  total  industry  emissions  (2005).  For  the  other  BRICS  countries,  calculations  show  11%  in 
Russia (2007), 9% in China (2005) and South Africa (1994), and 7% in India (2000). 
27 There  are  several  options  to  mitigate  emissions  –  recycling  and  material  saving,  inter-energetic 
replacement,  use  of  renewable  energy,  biomass  disposal  of  deforestation  and  co-generation 
(HENRIQUES JÚNIOR, 2010). 
28In order to reduce iron-steel sector emissions, Martin et al. (2000) and IEA (2008a) suggest: turning off 
obsolete, small capacity and low efficiency furnaces; the deployment of dry advanced wet coke-ovens; 
the  installation  of  pressure  recovery  turbines;  and  the usage  of  natural  gas  as  an  aid  in  the  reduction 
process of iron ore, among other measures.

distribution network, which is fundamental to disseminate the use of this energy source. 
In  addition,  there  is  a  lack  of  technological  training  for  new  technology  suppliers  and 
users,  as  well  as  a  lack  of  international  partnerships  that  could  boost  scientific-
technological trainings for the gradual abandonment of fossil energy. Moreover, one can 
argue  that  the  existing  governmental  incentives  to  leverage  low  emission  energy 
projects aren’t enough, hampering the adoption of some renewable and cleaner sources 
such as solar energy whose high short-term costs can make it economically unfeasible. 

The  high  costs  still  involved  in  the  course  of  emissions  abatement  continue  to  be  the 
main  reason  why  developing  countries  avoid  taking  part  in  international  binding 
commitments. Even so, it seems to be clear that the transition to a “green” industry can 
take  these  countries  to  a  leadership  position  among  their  counterparts.  According  to 
Hochstetler  and  Viola  (2012),  China  is  already  adopting  legal  measures  in  order  to 
reduce  energy  consumption  and  increase  the  use  of  renewable  sources,  aimed  at 
continuing and sustaining its  rapid  growth.  India wrote a non-binding National  Action 
Plan on Climate Change in 2008 that set a strategy for reducing emissions (Hallding et 
al.,  2011  apud  Hochstetler  and  Viola,  2012).In  South  Africa,  even  the  adoption  of 
carbon taxes has been under consideration. 

Actually, in absolute terms, Brazil’s voluntary mitigation goal for 2020 (reducing GHG 
emissions  by  36%  to  39%  compared  to  1990  levels)is  far  more  ambitious  than  the 
voluntary  goals  pledged  by  other  emerging  economies.  However,  non-governmental 
agencies  are  now  indicating  a  clear  reversion  of  the  former  emissions  decrease  path. 
Unfortunately, the significant shrinkage of CO2 release levels between 2004 and 2012, 
resulted mainly from an impressive drop in deforestation rates, has been supplanted by 
the increase of emissions in other sectors – energy, transportation, agribusiness, industry 
and solid waste (Observatório do Clima, 2014).29 

Thereby,  the  imminent  adoption  by  Europe  of  BCAs  could  force  Brazil  and  other 
nations  to  pay  more  attention  to  their  industry’s  environmental  vulnerability.  If  Brazil 
manages  to  quickly  promote  the  necessary  changes  and  adopts  the  right  measures  to 
transform  its  emission-intensive  sectors  into  sustainable  players  on  the  world  market, 
BCAs may be seen not as a threat, but as an opportunity to a "green" industry transition, 
which  can  bring  competitive  advantages  over  China,  India  and  other  emerging 
economies. 

3. Methodology 

In order to achieve the objectives of this paper, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) 
model  is  used.  What  is  presented  here  is  a  modified  version  of  the  GTAP-E  model 
(Burniaux and Truong, 2002), from now on called GTAP-EP (energy and process), that 
allows  the  simulation  of  the  EU’s  application  of  BCAs  to  carbon-intensive  products 
imported from countries that do not employ comparable policy actions to mitigate CO2 
emissions.  As  is  common  in  this  kind  of  analysis,  the  EU’s  Emission  Trading  System 
(EU  ETS)  is  represented  by  a  carbon  tax  that  is  equivalent  to  the  EU  ETS  carbon 
allowance price.30 Besides that, it also innovates by inserting a module which takes into 

                                                           
29 The most dramatic increase occurred in the energy sector – emissions have increased more than 30% 
in  the  period  (from  335  to  440  megatons).  And  between  1990  and  2012,  the  sector  has  increased  its 
emissions by 125% (Observatório do Clima, 2014). 
30 Theoretically, without uncertainty, a carbon tax and a cap and trade system are perfectly equivalent 
(Weitzman 1974; Goulder and Schein 2013).

account  industrial  processes  emissions  of  three  important  sectors  (chemicals,  iron  & 
steel  and  non-metallic  minerals), 31 as  well  as  the  indirect  costs  derived  from  the 
inclusion of  energy industries in the EU ETS.32 

GTAP-EP, is  a static comparative, multi-region,  multi-sector CGE model of the world 
economy that links all economies in the world through bilateral trade relationships. The 
accounting  relationships  of  the  model  ensure  the  balance  of  receipts  and  expenditures 
for every agent identified in the economy, whereas the behavioral equations specify the 
behavior of optimizing agents in the economy (producers, consumers, and government) 
based  on  microeconomic  theory  (Brockmeier,  2001).  The  GTAP-EP  model  assumes 
perfectly  competitive  markets,  constant  returns  to  scale  technology,  a  non-homothetic 
private  demand  system  and  a  foreign  trade  structure  characterized  by  the  Armington 
(1969)  assumption.  Assuming  weak  separability,  the  production  system  is  set  up  as  a 
series  of  nested  constant  elasticity  of  substitution  (CES)  functions.  The  GTAP-EP 
model includes a detailed representation  of energy  use in  production and  consumption 
and its associated carbon emissions.   

In the GTAP-EP  model, the variable BCA is  determined endogenously  and comprised 
of two different components – direct and indirect costs. Direct costs,    are associated to 
carbon  taxes  that  are  levied  on  European  emission-intensive  industries.33 In  order  to 
calculate them, carbon dioxide emissions intensities,  ,are multiplied by the carbon tax 
applied to EU sectors,     (eq.1). 

 

                                   

 
In turn, carbon dioxide emissions intensities (eq.2) are calculated considering the origin 
principle  by  dividing  one  j  sector’s  total  carbon  dioxide  emissions  (USD  million/ton 
CO2)  by  its  total  production  at  agent’s  price,    in  each  region  r,  where  total  carbon 
dioxide  emissions  encompass  the  ones  generated  by  the  use  of  domestic,       and 
imported intermediate inputs,    , and by the industrial processes of chemicals, iron & 
steel and non-metallic minerals,   . 
 

      

 

        

 

          

 
        

 
    

                  

 
Indirect costs,      to sector j (eq.3) arise as a market response to carbon taxes applied 
to EU energy sectors, since taxes’ immediate effect is the increase of electricity and gas 
costs,     and       respectively. 

                                                           
31 Concerning the database, a  new header (CO2PF) is included to consider  the  emissions generated by 
the industrial processes of these three specific sectors. 
32 According  to  the  European  Commission  (2014),  an  increase  in  the  energy  price  is  an  important 
political concern, once it can bring additional costs to households  and industries, affecting investment 
decisions and Europe’s global competitiveness. In recent years, regarding gas and electricity prices,  the 
differential between EU and its main economic partners has been increasing. As a consequence, some 
energy-intensive industries have been moving towards other countries where rules aren’t so strict and 
energy costs are lower. 
33 This paper assumes the equivalent of a carbon tax of USD 40 per ton of CO2 emitted.

In  order  to  find  the  costs  increase,  value  purchases  of  electricity, ,  and  gas,  ,  are 
multiplied by the variation of their respective prices,    and    (eqs. 4 and 5). 
 

   

                                       

   

                                     

 
Ad valorem taxes,    are calculated by taking into account both direct and indirect costs 
(eq.6).  
 

                 

                  

 
And as a final step, border carbon adjustment applied by the EU to sector j in region r, 
   arise from the sum of direct and indirect costs adjusted by a factor,  .34 
 

    

    

    
    

                            

 
Regarding the leakage rates, LR, they are also determined endogenously in percent and 
calculated by dividing the increase of CO2 emissions in the rest of world,        by the 
decrease of CO2 emissions in the EU,     (in module). 
 

        

     
                             

 
The regional aggregation is strategically set to analyze and compare Brazilian industrial 
competitiveness vis-à-vis the other BRICS. From the sectorial point of view, high levels 
of industrial process emissions and participation in international trade are the criteria for 
disaggregation.35 

In  this  model,  five  scenarios  are  constructed  aiming  to  capture  the  impacts  of  BCAs, 
industrial process emissions, and indirect costs.36 With the aid of three dummies in the 
model, it’s possible to choose to apply BCAs(or not) either considering (or not) process 
emissions and indirect costs.  

•  REF-NOPROC  (reference,  no  industrial  process  emissions):  EU  doesn’t 

apply BCAs and industrial process emissions aren’t taken into account;  

•  REF-PROC  (reference,  industrial  process  emissions):  EU  doesn’t  apply 

BCAs, but the industrial process emissions are taken into account; 

                                                           
34 The adjustment factor is used to convert the import prices into the appropriated c.i.f. (cost, insurance, 
freight) concept, once BCAs are levied at the point of importation (see more in Kuik and Hofkes, 2010). 
35 For a more detailed description of the aggregation, see Box 2 in Appendix. 
36 Scenarios are constructed using the 8.1 GTAP database version, which describes the world economy in 
2007 (latest version available). 

 

11 

•  BCA-NOPROC  (BCA,  no  industrial  process  emissions):  EU  applies  BCAs, 

but industrial process emissions aren’t taken into account;   

•  BCA-PROC: (BCA,  industrial  process  emissions): both BCAs and industrial 

processes emissions are considered, but indirect costs are not;  

•  BCA-PROC-P:  (BCA,  industrial  process  emissions  and  indirect  costs):  all 
the  new  aspects  are  considered  –  BCAs,  industrial  process  emissions  and  the 
indirect costs caused by the policy-induced increase of gas and electricity prices. 

4. Results and discussion 

4.1. BCAs effectiveness and EU welfare 

 
 

The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  analyze  the  effectiveness  and  the  importance  of 
considering BCAs to reduce carbon leakage. As can be seen  from Table 3, LR is very 
sensitive  to  BCA  and  process  emissions.  When  comparing  REF-NOPROC  to  REF-
PROC,  or  in  other  words,  when  processes  emissions  are  considered,  the  leakage  rate 
increases by 3.6%-points. This outcome shows the relevance of taking industrial process 
emissions  into  account  when  assessing  carbon  leakage,  and  thus  confirms  the  results 
found  by  Bednar-Friedl  et  al.  (2012).  The  authors  argue  that  carbon  leakage  is  higher 
when process emissions are correctly accounted for, which means that the leakage rate 
tends to be underestimated when models ignore this variable. According to the present 
simulations, the underestimation is around 25%.

* Equivalent variation (EV).37 

The  simulations  also  show  that  imposing  BCAs  on  imports  from  outside  the  EU  can 
result  in  a  considerable  decrease  in  the  rate  of  leakage.  When  comparing  the  REF-
PROC and BCA-PROC scenarios, the leakage rate drops by 9.3%-points; in the BCA-
PROC-P scenario the leakage rate drops by 9.5 %-point compared to REF-PROC.38 

                                                           
37 The equivalent variation (EV), a proxy for the economic welfare associated with a disturbance in the 
GTAP  model,  is  equal  to  the  difference  between  the  expenditure  required  for  the  new  level  of  utility 
(after simulation) at initial prices (YEV) and the level of utility available on  initial balance (Y), i.e., EV = 
YEV-Y  (McDougall,  2002).  It  can  be  broken  down  into  three  components:  allocative  effects,  terms  of 
trade and investment-savings balance. 
38 It’s  important  to  notice  that  this  is  a  global  analysis,  which  doesn’t  consider  individual  sectors.  But 
there  is  evidence  that  the  result  can  be  quite  different  for  sectoral  investigations.  Kuik  and  Hofkes 
(2010) show that leakage rates tend to be higher for more emission-intensive sectors.  

12 

 

Regarding the welfare effects, the comparison between REF-NOPROC and REF-PROC 
shows  that  economic  welfare  losses  are  smaller  when  processes  emissions  aren’t 
considered,  reinforcing  the  idea  that  models  that  ignore  this  variable  tend  to 
underestimate carbon taxes effects for the EU economy. The USD 2 billion difference in 
Equivalent Variation (EV) comes mainly from a better allocation of domestic resources 
(allocative  effect)    (USD  1.3  billion)    and  a  positive  terms-of-trade  effect  (USD  0.6 
billion). 

Finally,  BCAs  soften  welfare losses  (cf. REF-PROC  and BCA-PROC), but  even  more 
so if border carbon adjustments also include the effects of indirect costs (cf. REF-PROC 
and  BCA-PROC-P).Both  comparisons  confirm  BCAs  strong  positive  effects  on  the 
EU’s terms-of-trade.39 

 

4.2. Brazil’s industry competitiveness and welfare 

Considering that BCAs can be effective to curb carbon leakage, it’s important to explore 
their  effects  on  the  competitiveness  of  Brazilian  industrial  exports.  According  to  the 
simulations,  in  the  presence  of  BCAs  the  most  negatively  affected  sectors  are  non-
metallic  minerals  (cement),  iron  &  steel  and  non-ferrous  metals  (Table  4  and  Figure 
1). 40 Comparing  REF-PROC  and  BCA-PROC-P,  exports  from  these  sectors  change 
from  positive values to  highly negative ones, and  this can be concomitantly explained 
by  their  intense  use  of  energy  and  associated  CO2  emissions  and  their  high  level  of 
international trade exposure (see Table 1). 

Note  that  the  non-ferrous  metals  sector  differs  from  the  other  two  when  it  comes  to 
process  emissions,  because  it  cannot  be  classified  as  a  high  industrial  process  emitter. 
Nevertheless,  the  application  of  border  carbon  adjustments  (BCA-PROC  scenario) 
brings a 14%-point decrease in Brazilian exports to the EU and a 2%-point drop in its 
production (Table 4).  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                           
39Böhringer  and  Rutherford  (2002)  show  that  these  terms  of  trade  effects  can  dominate  the  overall 
economic  impacts  for  unilaterally  acting  countries  and  likewise  induce  substantial  losses  or  gains  to 
countries without abatements action. 
40 The chemical sector is not strongly affected by the employment of  BCAs because of its lower use of 
energy in comparison to non-metallic minerals, iron & steel and non-ferrous metals (see Table 1).

Comparing the REF-PROC and BCA-PROC-P scenarios,  Figure 1 shows  a significant 
decrease in the contribution of these Brazilian sectors to the European import basket – a 
22.6% drop for Brazil’s iron & steel sector, 18.4% for non-metallic minerals, and 15.9% 
for non-ferrous metals.41 

Specifically regarding the role of the industrial process  emissions on Brazilian exports 
competitiveness,  the  comparison  between  BCA-NOPROC  and  BCA-PROC  shows 
significant impacts on non-metallic minerals (cement) and iron & steel. As can be seen 
in Table 4, non-metallic minerals exports drop from -3.6% to -10.2%, and iron & steel 
exports drop from -2% to -15.1%. These results, which reflect the high level of process 
emissions of both sectors, reinforce the importance of taking into consideration the CO2 
released due to industrial processes.  

Examining the results for the non-metallic minerals sector (cement),we notice that in the 
presence of BCAs its production level is not affected, despite the great negative impact 
on  its  exports  to  the  EU.  Actually,  scenarios  considering  both  BCAs  and  processes 
emissions  (BCA-PROC  and  BCA-PROC-P)  even  show  a  little  increase  in  its 
production.  These  results  can  be  explained  by  a  reorientation  of  its  exports  to  “BCA-

This  outcome  supports  the  so-called  demand-side  leakage  (Copeland  and  Taylor, 
2004),since  BCA’s  effectiveness  is  reduced  due  to  the  existence  of  unregulated 
importing markets. However, it doesn’t mean that the sector is immune to BCA effects. 
According to MCTI (2013), its CO2 emissions have increased around 30% since 1990, 
mostly because the sector uses petroleum coke as its main source of energy (see Table 
2).  Therefore,  in  the  case  of  BCAs  being  adopted  by  other  developed  countries,  the 
sector could be strongly affected. 

Concerning  iron  &  steel,  the  application  of  BCAs  negatively  affects  both  exports  and 
production, and this can be explained by its high level of industrial process emissions. 
As can be seen in Table 5,when process emissions are taken into account, the BCA  ad 
valorem tariff for Brazilian iron & steel products entering the EU market is higher than 
the  ones  for  the  same  products  from  China  and  India.  In  other  words,  in  the  market 
where Brazil plays an important role, the imposition of BCAs exposes its environmental 
vulnerability. And this vulnerability, as section 2 showed, is  strongly connected to  the 
fact  that  its  production  process  technology  still  lags  behind  the  best  practices  already 
available.

In  the  presence  of  BCAs,  simulations  show  that  all  BRICS  countries  lose  welfare 
(measured by EV).42Specifically  regarding  Brazil, this happens  also  through allocative 
effects,  but  mainly  through  terms  of  trade(Figure  2).  Note  that  for  all  the  BCA 
scenarios, the losses of terms  of trade overcome  the  losses  of allocative effects. These 
results  show  that  even  if  Brazil  doesn’t  impose  any  carbon  taxes  on  its  industry,  it’s 
indirectly  charged  by  the  BCAs,  since  border  adjustments  work  as  a  burden-shifting 
mechanism,  transferring  part  of  EU  abatement  costs  to  non-abating  countries  through 
changes in the terms of trade in the most affected sectors.43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                           
42Actually,  the  carbon  taxes  applied  by  EU  on  its  own  industry  cause  an  overall  welfare  gain  to  Brazil, 
China, India and South Africa, but the BCAs drop them significantly. Besides this, the total world welfare 
decrease in all scenarios, especially in the BCAs ones. 
43Böhringer et al. (2012) state that BCAs can, at the same time, be effective to reduce carbon leakage 
and exacerbate regional inequality.

Supporting this argument, simulations also show that the EU itself is the most benefited 
region after the imposition of BCAs. Regarding non-metallic minerals and iron & steel, 
for  example,  the  participation  of  European  industries  in  its  own  market  increases  by 
8%-points and 5 %-points respectively (REF-PROC versus BCA-PROC-P).44 So, BCAs 
end up playing a  twofold role –they manage to  decrease emissions leakage and, at  the 
same time, they protect the most energy-intensive and trade-exposed European sectors. 

5. Conclusion 

Simulations show that BCAs are effective  in decreasing emissions leakage and  also in 
leveling  the  playing  field,  protecting  the  most  energy-intensive  and  trade-exposed 
European sectors. But as a side-effect, the EU ends up transferring part of the abatement 
costs to regions which do not employ similar environmental policies. This result, the so-
called  “burden-shifting”  effect,  is  evidenced  by  the  welfare  decrease  experienced  by 
most countries and also  by the significant  increase of  the European participation in  its 
own market. 

Regarding  Brazil,  the  three  most  affected  sectors  in  the  presence  of  BCAs  are  non-
metallic minerals, iron & steel and non-ferrous metals. What they all have in common is 
that they are, at the same time, export-oriented sectors and large CO2 emitters, and the 
combination of these two features is fundamental to determine their BCA vulnerability. 

Among the BRIC countries, Brazil would particularly lose competitiveness in its iron & 
steel sectors relative to China and India. 

The threat of border adjustments can simultaneously bring challenges and opportunities 
to  the  Brazilian  industry.  Brazil’s  biggest  challenge  is  to  maintain  its  world  export 
market share while finding, at the same time, an environmentally sustainable path. The 
point  is  that  Brazil  is  by  far  one  of  the  most  closed  countries  in  the  world,  and  its 

                                                           
44 It’s important to highlight that the domestic participation in these two sectors was already significant 
even before the employment of BCAs (PROC scenario) – 74% and 72% respectively.

economic  structure,  reliant  on  domestic  value  chain  integration,  makes  it  difficult  for 
industry to incorporate the most production efficient technologies. 

But if the country manages to overcome these barriers by opening up its economy and 
moving  towards  integration  with  global  value  chains,  there  are  good  opportunities, 
especially  among  the  non  energy  related  emitting  industrial  sectors,  since  they  can 
promote  changes  in  their  inputs  basket  (making  it  “greener”),  increase  their  energy 
efficiency, and also switch their production technology.
