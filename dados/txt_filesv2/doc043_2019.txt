Inflation and relative price variability in Brazil from 

1989 to 2007

ABSTRACT:  I  document  new  evidence  on  the  relationship  between  inflation  and  relative  price 
variability  (RPV)  using  store-level  data  on  prices  in  Brazil  from  1989  to  2007.  In  brief,  the  linkage 
grows stronger during periods of lower inflation rates. I divide the sample into two subsamples: from 
1989  to  1993  (hyperinflation);  and  from  1995  to  2007  (low  inflation).  I  study  the  distribution  of 
inflation at the most disaggregate level (brands), and I find strong support regarding the effect of 
Plano Real in decreasing inflation variability almost immediately after its implementation. The size 
and frequency of price changes also decreased right after the plan took place. The intramarket RPV 
significantly  increased  with  the  rate  of  inflation,  but  I  find  marked  differences  between  the  two 
inflationary scenarios. During hyperinflation, the relationship is roughly 70% of the magnitude during 
lower inflation, i.e., the linkage is looser during hyperinflation. The impact of deflation (in absolute 
terms)  is  weaker  than  the  impact  of  positive  inflation  during  hyperinflation,  yet  stronger  during 
lower  inflation.  I  also  document  similar  patterns  aggregating  brands  into  sectors  and  groups  of 
products.  This  paper  highlights  the  importance  of  considering  different  inflation  scenarios  when 
assessing inflation-related effects.

RESUMO: Este artigo documenta novas evidências sobre a relação entre inflação e variabilidade de 
preços  relativos  (RPV)  usando  dados  de  preços  no  nível  da  loja  no  Brasil  entre  1989  e  2007.  Em 
resumo, a ligação se fortalece durante períodos de taxas de inflação mais baixas. Eu divido a amostra 
em duas subamostras: de 1989 a 1993 (hiperinflação) e de 1995 a 2007 (baixa inflação). Eu estudo a 
distribuição da inflação no nível mais desagregado (marcas), e encontro evidências sobre o efeito do 
Plano Real na redução da variabilidade da inflação quase imediatamente após a sua implementação. 
O tamanho e a frequência das mudanças de preço também diminuíram logo após o plano. A RPV 
intra-mercado  aumentou  significativamente  com  a  taxa  de  inflação,  mas  eu  encontro  diferenças 
marcantes  entre  os  dois  cenários 
inflacionários.  Durante  a  hiperinflação,  a  relação  é  de 
aproximadamente 70% da magnitude encontrada durante o período de inflação mais baixa, isto é, a 
ligação é mais fraca durante a hiperinflação. O impacto de uma deflação (em termos absolutos) é 
menor do que o impacto de uma inflação positiva durante a hiperinflação, porém mais forte durante 
o período de inflação mais baixa. Eu também documento padrões semelhantes agregando marcas 
em  setores  e  grupos  de  produtos.  Este  artigo  destaca  a  importância  de  se  considerar  diferentes 
cenários de inflação ao avaliar impactos relacionados à inflação.

Introduction

Homogeneous goods are often sold at diﬀerent prices across various stores. Firms also adjust
their prices in diﬀerent amounts over time. When prices do not rise in tandem, demand shocks
and monetary policy have real economic eﬀects. Understanding the sources of price rigidi-
ties and unsynchronized price adjustments is central to assessing welfare losses and designing
eﬀective public policies.

Despite widespread evidence of a positive relationship between inﬂation and relative price vari-
ability (RPV), there is still room for studies regarding developing economies, especially studies
that address hyperinﬂationary episodes. This article addresses the issue through an examina-
tion of microdata from Brazil using almost 19 years of data including 5 years of hyperinﬂation.

The main question of this paper is as follows: Do inﬂation and intramarket inﬂation variability
have the same relationship during periods of hyperinﬂation and periods of low inﬂation? Using
store-level price quotes collected by the Funda¸c˜ao Instituto de Pesquisas Econˆomicas (FIPE)
in the city of S˜ao Paulo, I ﬁnd compelling evidence of marked diﬀerences between these two
scenarios.

The dataset comprises more than 6 million price quotes for 1,272 brands sold in 10,490 diﬀerent
stores from January 1989 to June 2007. I divide the sample into two very diﬀerent inﬂation-
ary regimes: (i) 1989–1993, when monthly inﬂation averaged 25.3% (hyperinﬂation), and (ii)
1995–2007, when monthly inﬂation averaged 0.6% (low inﬂation1).

I document the shape and structure of brand-level intramarket inﬂation for these two time
periods. The distribution of price changes is far from uniform or even symmetric. I ﬁnd evidence
of persistent inﬂation dispersion among ﬁrms selling the same brand of good or service. The
kernel estimation function drastically collapses after the hyperinﬂation ended.

I ﬁnd strong support that Plano Real decreased inﬂation dispersion immediately after its im-
plementation. The size and frequency of price changes also decrease right after the plan was
put into practice. There is no evidence of a transition path. The lower the level of aggregate
inﬂation, the lower the dispersion of price changes at the store level.

In both sample periods, inﬂation (in absolute terms) has a positive impact on intramarket
inﬂation variability. I perform ﬁxed eﬀects panel estimations considering two measures of RPV:
the standard deviation (SDP) of price changes across stores and the coeﬃcient of variation (CV)
of price levels across stores.

The magnitude of the impact of inﬂation on RPV is stronger when measured by the SDP than
when measured by the CV. Both measures indicate the presence of a positive and signiﬁcant
linkage, although the magnitude is roughly 70% weaker during hyperinﬂation. Higher levels
of inﬂation are normally associated with higher degrees of inﬂation variability, yet the link is
somewhat looser during the hyperinﬂation period.

1I refer to the period between 1995–2007 as the low-inﬂation period. Keep in mind that Brazil exhibits
higher and more volatile inﬂation levels than do developed economies. I use the term “low-inﬂation period”
only to emphasize the diﬀerence between this period and the hyperinﬂation years.

During hyperinﬂation, the weaker impact of inﬂation on its variability results from the frequency
of price increases. When inﬂation is very high, most price changes are increases, thus narrowing
the observed inﬂation dispersion among all items. On the other hand, when inﬂation is low
and more stable, price decreases and price increases are almost equally likely, thus widening
inﬂation dispersion. This translates into a relatively higher impact of inﬂation on its dispersion
in my low-inﬂation sample.

Note that inﬂation dispersion is, in fact, higher during hyperinﬂation. My results indicate only
that the correlation between inﬂation and inﬂation dispersion is weaker during hyperinﬂation.
When inﬂation is extremely high, inﬂation dispersion is also high, but not as high as predicted
by their relationship during low inﬂation.

I also investigate the presence of asymmetric eﬀects from negative and positive price movements
on RPV. The impact of deﬂation (in absolute terms) is weaker than the impact of positive
inﬂation during hyperinﬂation. In contrast, from 1995 to 2007, price decreases have a more
signiﬁcant impact on RPV than price increases.
I also document the same pattern when
analyzing diﬀerent sectors and groups of brands.

A higher frequency of price decreases also helps to explain the greater impact of negative
price movements on inﬂation dispersion during the 1995–2007 period for each sector/group of
product. I ﬁnd robust evidence of a structural change in the relationship between inﬂation and
RPV, depending on the inﬂationary regime. Although the eﬀect is signiﬁcant, I do not assume
any causal mechanism.

This paper contributes to a vast literature on tracking the relationship between inﬂation and
inﬂation variability. The novelty of this study’s empirical contribution is its rich and unprece-
dented dataset on store-level prices in Brazil, encompassing years of hyperinﬂation as well as
years of low inﬂation. I analyze more than 6 million price quotes taken from a period spanning
almost 19 years. The data included here is also extensive in terms of products (1,272 brands
of goods and services). I analyze a much larger dataset than Angelis (2012).

This paper closely relates to studies by Lach and Tsiddon (1992), Caglayan and Filiztekin
(2003), and Konieczny and Skrzypacz (2005). Lach and Tsiddon (1992) is one of the ﬁrst
empirical works based on microdata to investigate the relationship between inﬂation and RPV.2
The authors use data on 26 food items in Israel, at a time when inﬂation peaked at roughly
60% a year.

Lach and Tsiddon (1992) ﬁnd a positive association, mainly driven by the expected component
of inﬂation. The authors also ﬁnd evidence of unsynchronized price setting among ﬁrms, and
therefore advocate for some staggering in the way prices are set. They document that whenever
inﬂation is high, the distribution of real prices is not uniform or symmetric. My study strongly
supports their ﬁndings. I also document a positive relationship between RPV and inﬂation, as
well as an asymmetric inﬂation distribution during the years of hyperinﬂation in Brazil.

Caglayan and Filiztekin (2003) employ a similar approach, using price data on 22 food products

2Hoomissen (1988) also investigates the impact of inﬂation on price dispersion. She highlights the role of

inﬂation in reducing the information content of prices, which translates into greater price dispersion.

in Turkey. They emphasize the importance of considering structural changes in inﬂation.3 Their
main conclusion is that the association between inﬂation and RPV is signiﬁcantly weaker during
higher levels of inﬂation. I reach the same conclusion here.

The impact of inﬂation on its variability is stronger in the sample taken from 1995 to 2007 (low
inﬂation) in Brazil than in the sample taken from 1989 to 1993 (hyperinﬂation). When inﬂation
is low, price decreases are more likely, which widens the inﬂation distribution and translates
into a greater correlation between the level of inﬂation and its dispersion.

Konieczny and Skrzypacz (2005) investigate price-setting behavior in Poland after the disso-
lution of the Soviet Union. This was a period of high inﬂation in the country (from 250% in
1990 to 18% in 1996). The authors highlight a positive relationship between RPV and the
frequency, size, and dispersion of price changes. They document a stronger eﬀect of inﬂation
on RPV when the latter is measured by the SDP than when it is measured by the CV. I reach
the same conclusion using Brazilian data.

Price dispersion is a salient feature in both theoretical and empirical macroeconomic models.
The phenomenon is often associated with three nonexclusive sources: (i) diﬀerences in costs
and quality-related characteristics of products, (ii) menu costs, and (iii) imperfectly informed
consumers. The ﬁrst relates to inherent diﬀerences in the location where a product is sold.
Stores may diﬀer in terms of location, facilities, and other dimensions, a situation that results
in diﬀerent prices for the same commodity – see Stigler (1961) and Gorodnichenko et al. (2018).

Moreover, when price readjustments are costly, unsynchronized price setting may arise across
ﬁrms – see Sheshinski and Weiss (1977) and Benabou (1988). Finally, search costs associated
with discovering the lowest-priced ﬁrm may also lead to price dispersion in equilibrium – see
Burdett and Judd (1983), Benabou (1992), and Rauh (2007).

As inﬂation increases, the range of prices for the same homogeneous good spreads, and the
informational content of nominal prices decreases. Higher inﬂation is thus often associated with
higher degrees of price-change variability, which is one of the social costs of inﬂation. There
is a relatively broad consensus regarding the presence of a positive link between inﬂation and
inﬂation variability. Nevertheless, some studies document an eﬀect in the opposite direction,
leaving room for further investigation on the direction of the ﬁnal impact.

Reinsdorf (1994) uses data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics from 1980 to 1982 (Volcker
disinﬂation period) and ﬁnds that inﬂation and price dispersion may be negatively correlated.
Sheremirov (2015) also ﬁnds a negative relationship between price dispersion and inﬂation, but
the eﬀect is driven entirely by the presence of temporary sales. The author ﬁnds a positive
relation for regular prices. Silver and Ioannidis (2001) ﬁnd a similar negative relationship based
on intermarket data for 9 European countries.

The literature that investigates links between prices and their dispersion during high-inﬂation
scenarios includes Hoomissen (1988) and Lach and Tsiddon (1992) for Israel; Tommasi (1992)
for Argentina; Caglayan and Filiztekin (2003), Caglayan et al. (2008), and Baglan et al. (2016)
for Turkey; and Konieczny and Skrzypacz (2005) for Poland. Among these countries, only

relationship between inﬂation and RPV depending on the inﬂationary regime.

Argentina experienced hyperinﬂation similar to that experienced by Brazil from the 80s until
mid-90s. My dataset reﬂects considerably higher inﬂation variation than other studies.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the inﬂation environment in Brazil from
1989 to 2007. Section 3 presents the dataset and summarizes information on the frequency and
size of price adjustments during the covered period. Section 4 documents patterns of inﬂation
behavior at the brand level in diﬀerent inﬂationary scenarios. Section 5 presents the econometric
estimation of the relationship between inﬂation and intramarket inﬂation variability. Finally,
Section 6 oﬀers a conclusion.

Inﬂation environment

The data comprises two very diﬀerent inﬂation scenarios in the Brazilian economy. From Jan-
uary 1989 to June 1994, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measured by FIPE rose 472,894,862%.
Annual inﬂation reached three digits, peaking at 2,490% in 1993. Monthly inﬂation peaked at
79.1% in March 1990. At a certain point, prices in Brazil rose close to 2% a day. A series of
economics plans attempted halt the chronic hyperinﬂation process.

An extensive set of unorthodox policies were tested, such as freezing prices and wages adjust-
ments by law and conﬁscating personal savings to prevent demand pressures on prices. From
1989 to 1993 all the plans failed. Brazil also changed currency four times during those years.
See Giambiagi et al. (2010) for an extensive description of the Brazilian economy.

It was only under the successful implementation of Plano Real in July 1994 that hyperinﬂation
was ﬁnally tamed in Brazil. The plan signiﬁcantly altered inﬂation dynamics in the country,
ﬁnally controlling the explosive CPI path. The impact of Plano Real was immediate. Monthly
inﬂation went from 50.8% in June 1994 to 6.9% in July and 1.9% in August of the same year.

Figure 1 illustrates the behavior of the monthly CPI-FIPE during the sample years, as well as
the subsamples in Figure 1b (hyperinﬂation) and Figure 1c (low inﬂation rates). The vertical
line in Figure 1a marks the implementation of Plano Real in July 1994. My subsample division
excludes 1994.

Brazil underwent two very distinct inﬂation regimes during the sample period. From 1989 to
1993 annual inﬂation averaged 1,470%, whereas from 1995 to 2007 it averaged 7.1%.4 Monthly
inﬂation averages 25.3% from 1989 to 1993 and 0.6% from 1995 to 2007. In this paper, I explore
the diﬀerences inherent in each scenario.

I split the sample into two subsamples: hyperinﬂation (1989–1993) and low inﬂation (1995–2007).
This pragmatic division is possible only because Brazil has undergone two distinct inﬂationary
regimes. There is a clear structural break in the data. Because the range of data is signiﬁcantly
large, the Brazilian case is especially suitable for analyzing inﬂation and inﬂation variability.

Brazil underwent one of the most prolonged periods of hyperinﬂation ever witnessed by a

economies.

country, and to a certain extent this was due to the fact that the economy was severely indexed.
Indexation was probably the central component of Brazilian inﬂation. Almost all contracts were
automatically adjusted according to past inﬂation.

Through a spiral of adjustments, high past inﬂation contributed to even higher future inﬂation.
The key to taming escalating price increases was then to stop this cycle. Plano Real succeeded
by introducing a temporary index into the economy, the units of real value (Unidade Real de
Valor - URV).

The most crucial aspect of the plan was the creation of the URV. Prices were quoted in Cruzeiros
Reais (CR$) at that time, and by March 1994 the new index was introduced. The index had
daily ﬂuctuations pegged to the US dollar. The URV acted as a unit of account for transactions.
All agents were encouraged to quote prices in CR$ and URV’s. Prices would rise in CR$,
but prices in URV’s would be much better behaved, because they were connected to a stable
currency.

5

Consumers and sellers had three months to adapt to the new indexing and pricing processes.
Once prices in URV’s were stable, the new currency (Real - R$) was introduced. On July 1,
1994, all prices in Cruzeiros Reais were converted to Reais at the rate of R$ 1 to CR$ 2,750.
This mechanism made it possible to break once and for all the hyperinﬂation in Brazil. The
Real is still the oﬃcial currency in the country until today.

3 Data

This paper uses the dataset for the CPI collected by FIPE. The data consists of monthly price
quotes at the store level for a variety of goods and services (100% in CPI weight). The original
dataset comprises 12,921,795 price quotations from January 1989 to June 2007. The dataset
covers the geographical area of the city of S˜ao Paulo, which corresponds to roughly 11% of the
total national GDP.5 Tracking the same good/service in the same store through time yields a
price trajectory. The cross-section dimension tracks the dispersion among diﬀerent brands and
outlets.

The unit of interest is deﬁned as a particular brand. Brands are set in the sample as a summary
of the product’s main characteristics, such as size, packing, material, etc. An aggregation of
one or more brands comprises the product deﬁnition in the CPI. For example, many brands of
soda, such as Coca-Cola, Guaran´a, Fanta Uva, aggregate into the product level Soda, a part
of the group Foods and Beverages, with a weight of 1.2% in the total CPI. The CPI-FIPE is
published at the product level, which is the equivalent of the entry level items (ELIs) in the
United States. There is no brand substitution or sales ﬂag in the sample.

and Figure 2b presents the evolution of prices in log scale. These two ﬁgures show how Plano
Real aﬀected individual price setting and inﬂation. They also illustrate how price dispersion is
a common feature in the data. Although the brand is completely homogeneous, its price diﬀers
across stores in a given period of time.

The original dataset was treated to eliminate prices not in accordance with this paper’s purpose.
First, I drop all prices regulated by the government, because they obey particular rules of
readjustment. Products in this sector include water and sewer utilities, electricity, gasoline,
and prescription drugs, for instance. Regulated goods and services account for 502,463 price
quotes in the dataset, which correspond to 27.3% in CPI weight on average. This paper focuses
only on nonregulated prices.

I also exclude prices of rent, condo fee, and housekeeping services, because their methodology
of price quoting changed many times during the sample period. I also drop brands with fewer
than 10 price quotes per month, that is, fewer less than 10 stores selling the brand each month.
Because the focus is on price variability, I ensure a minimal threshold of quotations per brand.
The treated dataset corresponds to 51.9% of the original number of price quotes and 45.6% in
CPI weight. Table 1 presents the comparison between the original and treated dataset.

The treated sample encompasses 6,708,165 individual price quotes. A combination of brand
and outlet deﬁnes an item. Brands are sold in 10,490 diﬀerent stores, which results in 216,944
diﬀerent items. Each item has its own price trajectory. The treated dataset comprises informa-
tion about 1,272 brands. Most of the literature on inﬂation variability analyzes only a subset
of products, mostly food. For instance, Hoomissen (1988) considers only 13 goods, Lach and
Tsiddon (1992) analyze 26 food products, Reinsdorf (1994) addresses 65 food items, Konieczny
and Skrzypacz (2005) examine 52 goods, and Baglan et al. (2016) investigate 128 goods.

The dataset is also representative in terms of groups of products considered. The FIPE-CPI
basket is divided into 7 groups of products: (i) Housing, (ii) Food, (iii) Transportation, (iv) Per-
sonal expenses, (v) Healthcare, (vi) Apparel, (vii) Education. All 7 groups are represented in my
dataset, which is a somewhat unique feature of this study. Figure 3 presents the comparison
between the CPI weight (year 2000)6 and the sample weight. The groups Food and Personal

study.

lated prices and rent explain most of the eﬀect. Regulated prices in Transportation were also
dropped.

3.1 Summary statistics

In this subsection, I summarize the information on the probability and size of price changes for
the 1,272 brands in the sample. Let Pijt be the price of a brand i sold in outlet j at time t.
I ﬁrst compute the average monthly frequency of price changes for each brand as the fraction
of the total number of pijt (cid:54)= pijt−1 to all nonmissing price observations between two periods t
and t − 1 (including zero price changes).

I combine data from items to products by a simple average. I then use the product-speciﬁc

The two inﬂationary scenarios in my sample display marked diﬀerences regarding the frequency
and size of price adjustments. Table 2 summarizes the information on the frequency and size
of price changes. The average inﬂation rate from 1989 to 1993 is 25.3%. During hyperinﬂation
(1989 to 1993), an average of 80.3% of all prices changes every month. The frequency peaks at
93.9% in 1993; that is, prices are almost entirely ﬂexible. Prices also may change more than
once per month, but my monthly dataset prevents me from observing such movements. It may
be the case that some stores changed prices more than once per month.

From 1989 to 1993, the majority of price movements are increases. The frequency of increases
is 74.6%, whereas the frequency of decreases is only 5.7%. Price decreases are no more than
7% of all price changes during hyperinﬂation. Although it is less frequent, some prices drop
each month during hyperinﬂation.

I do not ﬁnd evidence of the frequency of price decreases converging to zero. Even during
hyperinﬂation, some prices are dropping every month in Brazil. Nevertheless, this behavior is
mainly observed in prices of food items, whereas prices of services present more rigidity (see
Araujo (2018) for a detailed discussion).

The monthly frequency of price changes drops drastically after Plano Real. During the lower-
inﬂation period (1995–2007), the average frequency of price changes is 37.5%. Not only do prices
change less often, but price decreases become more likely. From 1995 to 2007, price decreases

9

correspond to a share of roughly 43% of all price movements. The shift in the frequency of
price change occurs immediately after Plano Real. Figure 4a plots the monthly series of ft,
t , and f−
f +
t . I ﬁnd no evidence of a transition period after the plan. Plano Real signiﬁcantly
changed price setting in Brazil.

Figure 4: Frequency and size of price changes

Figure 4b plots the time series for the absolute size of nonzero price changes. From 1989 to
1993, the average size is 27.8%, above the average inﬂation of 25.3%. The size of price increases
is 28.2% on average, whereas the size of price decreases is 8.2%. During hyperinﬂation, prices
often undergo changes – and changes of large magnitude. On the other hand, from 1995 to 2007,
the average size of price changes is 10.6%. The magnitude is larger than the average monthly
inﬂation in this period (0.6%). This gap results from the higher frequency of price decreases,
because the size of price increases and decreases are somewhat similar (8.2% vs. 10.2%).

4 The morphology of inﬂation

In this section, I focus on the shape and structure of the distribution of price changes (inﬂation
dispersion). This approach, rather than directly examining price level dispersion, has the
advantage of diﬀerencing out store-level eﬀects, controlling for possible nonstationarities in
price levels, and facilitating aggregation of diﬀerent products. See Lach and Tsiddon (1992). I
focus on heterogeneities in the rate of inﬂation across sellers of the same brand.

Deﬁne pijt as the price of a brand i in store j at time t. The rate of change in prices between t
and t − 1 is set as: πijt ≡ ln pijt − ln pijt−1. The in-sample rate of inﬂation of a brand i among

((cid:98)πt). Brands are aggregated into n products using a simple average. A measure of aggregate

terfactual inﬂation also replicates the drastic decrease in inﬂation immediately after Plano
Real.

In the

I now focus on the morphology of inﬂation variability. Firms adjust prices in diﬀerent amounts
each period, and this pattern is consistently present. Figure 6 displays the kernel estimates of
the inﬂation rate distribution pooled over brands (πit). I split the sample into years and inﬂation
scenarios. The data clearly shows that the hypothesis of synchronized price adjustments does
not hold. Each market for a speciﬁc brand adjusts prices by a certain amount.

The link between inﬂation and the inﬂationary environment is also interesting. Figure 6a
presents the kernel estimates for the hyperinﬂation years, and Figure 6b presents the estimation
for the low rates of inﬂation years. During the 1989–1993 period, the kernel estimate exhibits
a higher degree of dispersion. The distribution is also leptokurtic and asymmetric. The size
of price adjustments is approximately 30% of monthly price increases. I ﬁnd no evidence of
uniﬁed price adjustments during hyperinﬂation.

In contrast, during the 1995–2007 sample period, the kernel estimation is consistently more
symmetric around zero and exhibits noticeably less dispersion. The kernel distributions for all
years from 1995 to 2007 are surprisingly similar.

In order to illustrate the remarkable impact of Plano Real on the distribution of price ad-
justments, Figure 7 illustrates the density function for the years 1993 and 1994. Note the
concentration around 30% of price changes during 1993 in Figure 7a. The distribution of
inﬂation is mildly asymmetric to higher adjustment values.

Interestingly, the 1994 distribution is bimodal. This pattern results from the implementation
of Plano Real in the middle of the year, in July 1994. Figure 7b illustrates the monthly kernel
estimates of intramarket inﬂation for the year 1994. Note the bimodal pattern in the data,
with a transition month (July 1994), precisely when the plan was implemented.

Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the importance of Plano Real in controlling inﬂation and its dispersion
among the most individual-level price observations in the sample (brands). The plan not only
ended hyperinﬂation but signiﬁcantly altered price-setting behavior as well. Once inﬂation is
lower, producers adjust prices less often and less dispersed in time. There is less dispersion in
inﬂation both between sellers of the same good and between sellers of diﬀerent goods.

Inﬂation and relative price variability

This section investigates the impact of inﬂation on the dispersion of price adjustments among
all ﬁrms selling the same brand of good/service (intramarket RPV). The interest lies in how the

ﬁrst moment of inﬂation aﬀects the second moment of its distribution, that is, how inﬂation
is linked to inﬂation variability. Following Konieczny and Skrzypacz (2005), I focus on two
measures of inﬂation variability: the standard deviation of price changes and the coeﬃcient of
variation of price levels. Deﬁne the standard deviation (SDPit) of price changes across stores
as

13

of the rates of price change around the average inﬂation rate across all sellers of a particular
brand, the cross-sectional variance of inﬂation.

In addition, deﬁne the coeﬃcient of variation (CVit) of price levels across stores as

Where pit is the average price level of a brand i across stores at time t. The coeﬃcient (CVit)
accounts for contemporaneous discrepancies between the price of the same brand across all of
its sellers. Following Konieczny and Skrzypacz (2005), I work with both measures of price
variability.

One imperfect aggregate measure of price-change dispersion is set by combining brands into
products by a simple average and then using CPI weights to compute an aggregate index for
both measures of variability (SP D and CV ). Following Alvarez et al. (2011), Figure 8 plots the
aggregate measures alongside monthly CPI-FIPE. The correlation coeﬃcient is 0.94 for SPD
and 0.87 for CV. Note that during the hyperinﬂation period in Brazil, RPV was signiﬁcantly
higher. Higher levels of inﬂation widen the inﬂation variability range under both measures.

As an initial guideline, Figure 9 present a visual inspection of the relationship between inﬂation
and inﬂation variability during both sample periods. Figures 9a and 9b present scatter plots
of the standard deviation of price changes, and Figures 9c and 9d for the coeﬃcient of varia-
tion of price levels. The distribution of inﬂation variability is quite diﬀerent between the two
inﬂationary scenarios. For both measures, the relationship does not appear to be symmetric
around zero.

5.1 Fixed eﬀects panel

To estimate the eﬀect of inﬂation on inﬂation variability, I run ﬁxed eﬀects panels regressions
with both measures of dispersion (SPD and CV) as dependent variables. I use two diﬀerent
approaches: I estimate the impact of the absolute value of inﬂation and I also split inﬂation
into the absolute value of positive and negative movements to highlight the importance of
asymmetric impacts. The estimation procedure is deﬁned as

on inﬂation variability. The coeﬃcient β1 refers to the impact of positive price movements
and the coeﬃcient β2 to the impact of the absolute value of negative price movements. Table
4 presents the estimation results for the hyperinﬂation period (1989–1993), the low-inﬂation
period (1995–2007), and the entire sample period

The hypothesis of a positive relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation variability ﬁnds strong
support in the Brazilian data. I ﬁnd evidence of a signiﬁcant and positive correlation between
inﬂation and inﬂation variability captured by the linear coeﬃcient. Considering all 19 years
of the sample, the linear coeﬃcient on the absolute value of inﬂation indicates an eﬀect of
0.345 in magnitude for SPD and 0.306 in magnitude for CV. The magnitude of the impact of
inﬂation on RPV is stronger when measured by SDP than when measured by CV. Konieczny
and Skrzypacz (2005) reach the same conclusion.

The overall degree of association between inﬂation and RPV is weaker during the hyperinﬂation
years. The interstore inﬂation variability signiﬁcantly increases with the rate of inﬂation,
but the relationship is somewhat looser during hyperinﬂation. Considering Equation (1), the
coeﬃcient β is 0.314 from 1989 to 1993 and 0.448 from 1995 to 2007. The strength of the linear
relationship is roughly 70% weaker during the years hyperinﬂation in Brazil (or, equivalently,
40% stronger during the low-inﬂation sample).

A similar conclusion is reached in Equation (3), where the coeﬃcient β is also roughly 70%
weaker comparing hyperinﬂation to low inﬂation (0.221 vs. 0.304). Both results are statistically
signiﬁcant at the 5% conﬁdence level. The inﬂationary regime thus impacts the strength of
the relationship. This result is in line with Caglayan and Filiztekin (2003), who also report
evidence on a signiﬁcantly lower association between inﬂation and inﬂation variability during
high-inﬂation years in Turkey.

The looser link between inﬂation and RPV during hyperinﬂation is explained by the higher
frequency of price increases during that period. When inﬂation is high, most price changes are
price increases, which narrows inﬂation dispersion at the brand level. Thus, the relationship
between inﬂation and its dispersion is weaker during these years.

16

Nevertheless, after Plano Real, price decreases are almost as likely as price increases, which
widens price-change dispersion in the data and increases the impact of inﬂation on it. Note
that price changes dispersion is higher during hyperinﬂation than during low inﬂation. The
point is that the impact of inﬂation on RPV is relatively higher during low inﬂation because for
low inﬂation levels, there is higher inﬂation dispersion due to the presence of price decreases.

I also ﬁnd evidence of asymmetric eﬀects. Deﬂation, in absolute terms, has a higher impact
on RPV considering both RPV measures during the 1995–2007 sample. During lower levels of
inﬂation in Brazil, price decreases contribute marginally more to price dispersion than do price

increases. From Equation (2) 1995–2007 sample period, the impact of (cid:12)(cid:12)π−
(cid:12)(cid:12) is 0.518 against

To gain further insight into the importance of inﬂation in price adjustment variability, I per-
form a simple least squared estimation on intramarket data individually for each of the 221
months in the sample. Table 4 presents evidence on a structural change in the relationship
between inﬂation and RPV. During hyperinﬂationary episodes, the relationship is signiﬁcantly
lower. The additional exercise enables for time-varying eﬀects without imposing any timing
for breakpoints in the sample, thus allowing for an investigation of the structural change. The
estimation procedure is set as

SPDit = λit + βt |πit| + it,

for each t = 2, 3, ..., 222

CVit = λit + βt |πit| + it,

for each t = 2, 3, ..., 222

(5)

(6)

Where λit is the intercept of the regression for each month. I focus on the time evolution of
βt. Figure 10 plots the OLS results for all months in the sample. A major structural change
is clearly evident in July 1994, precisely when Plano Real was implemented. The shift is clear,
and both coeﬃcients – considering SDP and CV as the dependent variable – display a similar
timing of breakpoints.

Once the hyperinﬂation spiral was tamed, the structure of the relationship between inﬂation
and inﬂation variability changed. I conﬁrm a higher impact of inﬂation on RPV for both SDP
and CV during low inﬂation. The link between inﬂation and inﬂation variability was looser
during the hyperinﬂation years. Once again, I ﬁnd no evidence of a transition period.

I also document the estimation results of β, β1, and β2 based on sectors and groups of brands.
The estimation results are displayed in Table ??.
I aggregate products into three sectors:
Services, Industrial goods, and Food at home. I follow the methodology of the Brazilian Central
Bank (BCB) to aggregate products. This aggregation is common in the literature as well. I

17

Figure 10: Rolling regression results for βSP D and βCV

also present the estimation for products in each of the 7 groups of products in the CPI-FIPE,
namely Housing, Food, Transportation, Personal expenses, Healthcare, Apparel, and Education.

All sectors and groups associated with the 1,272 brands conﬁrm the same aggregate empirical
result: inﬂation and inﬂation variability present a signiﬁcant positive relationship, and this link
is stronger during low inﬂation than during hyperinﬂation. I also document asymmetries for
upward and downward price movements.

It may not be the case that all goods and services will be aﬀected to the same degree by varia-
tions in inﬂation. It is possible that, due to the purchase frequency or relative expensiveness of
brands, price adjustments dispersion will vary across brands. Although diﬀerent categories of
brands are similar in terms of the impact’s signiﬁcance and direction, some diﬀerences appear
across these categories. The magnitude of the impact of inﬂation is stronger for Services.

Food at home items, on the other hand, present a weaker relationship, which is probably due
to a higher incidence of supply shocks (price decreases). Regarding the division of products
in groups, the RPV of Healthcare and Education brands are strongly correlated to inﬂation.
Prices are stickier in both groups, so unsynchronized timing of adjustments also aﬀects the link.
The coeﬃcient is also high in Apparel.

In short, the empirical evidence suggests a looser link between inﬂation and inﬂation variabil-
ity during the Brazilian hyperinﬂation years. Inﬂation drives a wedge into the informational
content of nominal prices, causing persistent distorting impacts on relative price adjustments.
Nonetheless, when inﬂation is at skyrocketing levels, as in the Brazilian economy in the mid-
80s and mid-90s, ﬁrms will change prices according to sources of information other than price
movements among their competitors. High inﬂation distorts the channel through which inﬂa-
tion aﬀects relative price variability.

6 Concluding remarks

This paper investigates patterns of price-change variability across ﬁrms selling the same ho-
mogeneous brand using Brazilian microdata from 1989 to 2007. I ﬁnd evidence of a diﬀerent
relationship between relative price variability and inﬂation during hyperinﬂation and lower
levels of inﬂation at the microeconomic level. The link (in magnitude) during hyperinﬂation
is roughly 70% of the magnitude during low inﬂation. I also ﬁnd asymmetric impacts from
deﬂation and positive inﬂation.

I document the morphology of inﬂation variability at the brand level across time. I ﬁnd evidence
of an asymmetric and leptokurtic kernel density function during the years of hyperinﬂation.
The distribution is more symmetric and concentrated around lower values of inﬂation during the
1995–2007 period. I ﬁnd no evidence of a transitional period. The density function on inﬂation
instantaneously adjusted to a new pattern once Plano Real was implemented in July 1994. I
also provide a set of summary statistics regarding the frequency and size of price adjustments,
which also highlight the substantial impact of the plan on price-setting behavior in Brazil.

The empirical results obtained in this paper indicate a positive relationship between inﬂation
and intramarket inﬂation variability. Through a ﬁxed eﬀects panel estimation, I ﬁnd compelling
evidence of a signiﬁcantly weaker association between inﬂation and RPV during hyperinﬂation.
Higher levels of inﬂation are associated with higher inﬂation variability, but the relationship is
somewhat looser during hyperinﬂation, which relates to the higher frequency of price increases
during this period.

The impact of deﬂation (in absolute terms) is weaker than the impact of positive inﬂation during
hyperinﬂation, yet stronger during low inﬂation. The magnitude of the impact of inﬂation on
RPV is stronger when measured by SDP than when measured by CV. The empirical evidence
indicates diﬀerent inﬂation-RPV links depending on the inﬂationary environment.

Despite the extensive empirical evidence on the relationship between inﬂation and inﬂation
variability, there is still room for research on developing countries, especially during hyperin-
ﬂation. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing a unique dataset on more than
6 million store-level prices encompassing 5 years of hyperinﬂation in Brazil. The data is also
extensive in terms of products. I analyze data on 1,272 brands of goods and services from 1989
to 2007 (almost 19 years). The paper provides further evidence highlighting the importance of
considering diﬀerent inﬂation scenarios when assessing inﬂation-related eﬀects.
