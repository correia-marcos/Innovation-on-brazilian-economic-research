Resumo:  O  presente  artigo  mensura  os  impactos  que  os  preços  internacionais  de  commodities 
exercem sobre o investimento, notadamente sobre a FBCF em máquinas e equipamentos no Brasil, 
com dados trimestrais entre 1996 e 2017. A identificação de vetores cointegrantes entre os vários 
modelos propostos viabilizou a especificação de Modelos Autorregressivos de Correção de Erros 
Estruturais (SVEC), possibilitando distinguir as relações contemporâneas e persistentes dos choques 
estruturais. Os principais resultados encontrados são: i) relação positiva entre preços internacionais 
das commodities e investimento privado em máquinas e equipamentos; ii) choques positivos na taxa 
de  câmbio  efetiva  real, ou  seja,  depreciações  da  moeda  local,  afetam  negativamente  a  FBCF  em 
máquinas  e  equipamentos;  (iii)  o  investimento  público  exerceu  uma  influência  complementar  ao 
investimento  privado,  ou  seja,  percebeu-se  um  efeito  crowding-in  sobre  o  investimento  em 
máquinas  e  equipamentos;  e  iv)  os  preços  das  commodities  internacionais  respondem  por 
aproximadamente 56% da variação do investimento em máquinas e equipamentos, sendo, portanto, 
uma variável decisiva nas decisões de investimento no Brasil. Tais resultados ressaltam a influência 
externa sobre a dinâmica de investimento no Brasil, reforçando o debate sobre os conhecidos “voos 
de galinha” da economia brasileira.

Abstract: The present article measures the impact of international commodity prices on investment, 
especially  on  gross  fixed  capital  formation  (GFCF)  in  machinery  and  equipment  in  Brazil,  with 
quarterly data between 1996 and 2018. The identification of cointegrating vectors in the proposed 
models  enabled  the  specification  of  Autoregressive  Structural  Error  Correction  Models  (SVEC), 
making it possible to distinguish the contemporary and persistent relations of structural shocks. The 
main  results  are:  i)  a  positive  relationship  between  international  commodity  prices  and  GFCF  in 
machinery  and  equipment;  ii)  positive  shocks  on  the  real  exchange  rate,  i.e.  local  currency 
depreciations, negatively affect GFCF in machinery and equipment; (iii) public investment exerted 
a complementary influence on private investment, that is, it had a crowding-in effect on investment 
in  machinery  and  equipment;  and  (iv)  the  prices  of  international  commodities  account  for 
approximately 56% of the variance of the investment in machinery and equipment, being, therefore, 
a  decisive  variable  on  the  investment  decisions  in  Brazil.  These  results  highlight  the  external 
influence on the investment dynamics in Brazil, reinforcing the debate about the known "chicken 
flights" of the Brazilian economy.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The commodity super cycle seen in the early 2000s has been the motivation of an intense 
debate  in  academy  looking  to  understand  its  dynamic  consequences  over  the  economy  due  to 

 

 

1 

commodity price variation. Over this period, a steep increase of international prices was seen, going 
over 100% in average real terms. For some commodities, such as iron and other industrial materials, 
global prices increased more than three times in real terms, as can be seen on Figure 1, panel a. As a 
consequence, this long expansion cycle translated into gains in terms of trade for many countries, 
which  came  along  with  an  overall  improvement  in  the  results  of  those  economies  focused  on 
production and exportation of commodities (IMF, 2017). 

Brazil was no exception to that process, sharing the same improvement seen in the terms of 
trade, aligned with the performance of international commodity prices, Figure 1, panel b. Between 
2003 and 2008, the country saw an increase in exportation numbers of US$ 72 billion to US$ 197 
billion, with an average GDP growth of 4,8%. Costa et al. (2016) indicate that, between 2000 and 
2010, three sectors of the agricultural and extractive industries in Brazil were responsible for 82% 
growth  in  exportations  to  China:  non-precious  metal  mining  (45%),  soy  (23%)  and  oil  and  gas 
(14%). 

Despite  the  fact  that  the  macroeconomic  effect  of  commodity  price  fluctuation  has  a 
extensive coverage in academic literature, many of the studies have focused on the impact of the 
shock  in  oil  prices  in  developed  countries,  i.  e.  Blanchard  and  Galí  (2007)  and  Killian  (2009). 
Recent studies, such as Camacho and Perez-Quiros (2014), Gruss (2014), Fornero et al. (2016) and 
Fernandez et al. (2018), have examined these effects on developing and emerging economies who 
are  strongly  dependent  on  commodity  exportation.  In  general,  their  findings  points  out  that 
fluctuation in commodity prices are a major driver of economic cycles in these economies.

used were: (i) All Commodity Price Index, 2016 = 100; (ii) Food Price Index, 2016 = 100; (iii) Metals Price Index,

The studies for Brazil are still scarce, with the main reference being dos Santos et al. (2016). 
In this study, the international commodity index was used as an instrument for Brazilian GDP in a 
structural  autoregressive  vector  analysis  to  test  the  relationships  between  gross  capital  formation 
and commodity prices. In fact, according to Figure 2, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) 
index is highly correlated with international commodity prices suggesting that the effects of shocks 
on  the  terms  of  trade  have  an  impact  on  macroeconomic  fluctuations,  especially  on  the  level  of 
aggregate investment in the country.

Statistics and the World Economic Outlook, All Commodity Price Index, 2005 = 100. 

 
Inspired  by  this  literature,  the  main  objective  of  this  study  is  to  measure  the  impact  of 
international  commodity  prices  on  investment,  especially  on  gross  fixed  capital  formation  in 
machinery and equipment in Brazil, using quarterly data between 1996 and 2018. This objective is 
related to the working hypothesis that permeates this research, in which fluctuations in international 
commodity prices are a key determinant of short flights or "chicken flights" to which the Brazilian 
economy  is  subject.  For  this,  we  employ  a  Structural  Vector  Autoregression  (SVAR)  approach, 
using  the  following  variables:  i)  gross  fixed  capital  formation  in  machinery  and  equipment 
(GFCF_ME) or called here as private investment1; ii) gross fixed capital formation of the public 
administrations  (GFCG_PA)2;  iii)  price  index  of  international  commodities;  and  iv)  the  real 
effective exchange rate. The identification of cointegrating vectors in the models proposed in this 
study enabled the specification of Structural Vector Error Correction (SVEC) models, an approach 
not  yet  published  for  this  dataset,  making  it  possible  to  distinguish  contemporary  and  persistent 
relationships from structural shocks.  

Among  the  main  results,  the  following  stand  out:  i)  a  shock  of  standard  deviation  on 
international commodity prices results in a persistent growth in the level of investments of around 
6%; ii) shocks on the real effective exchange rate, depreciation of the local currency, have negative 
effects  on  the  investment,  with  persistent  effects  that  converge  to  approximately  2.3%  after  9 
quarters; iii) public investment exerted a complementary influence on private investment, that is, it 
had  a  crowding  in  effect  on  investment  in  machinery  and  equipment,  with  a  persistent  effect  of 
3.7% after 07 quarters; and iv) the analysis of variance decomposition points to commodity prices 
as the main source of forecast error of private investment, accounting for approximately 53% of the 
variance of the investment as of the 8th quarter. In this way, the results are in line with the recent 
studies  for  commodity  exporting  countries  as  Camacho  and  Perez-Quiros  (2014),  Gruss  (2014), 
Fornero  et  al.(2016)  and  Fernandez  et  al.  (2018),  indicating  that  the  dynamics  of  investment  in 
Brazil  are  strongly  impacted  by  the  fluctuations  in  terms  of  trade  resulting  from  changes  in 
international commodity prices. 

We believe that our preliminary results will contribute to the economic debate regarding the 
role of fiscal policy in a commodity export economy. Given the obtained results, its correlation with 
the  known  "chicken  flights"  of  the  Brazilian  economy  appears  naturally.  In  terms  of  policy 
                                                            
1 According to the methodology proposed by Carvalho and Ribeiro (2014). Although not a precise measure of private 
investment, we adopted this nomenclature given the preponderance of private investment in machinery and equipment 
as opposed to the share of public investment (GFCF of PA). 
2 The GFCF of public administrations (PA) does not include the investment made by state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

implications,  our  results  strengthen  the  necessity  for  reforms,  enabling  a  countercyclical  fiscal 
policy, which could act as a cushion for these cycles and could help the growth of the potential 
GDP,  minimizing the occurrence of these short flights associated to the expansion and recession 
dynamics originated from the commodity cycles. 

 
 

 

2.  METHODOLOGY: STRUCTURAL VECTOR AUTOREGRESSION MODELS 

 
2.1. DATABASE, STATIONARY TESTS AND COINTEGRATION 

 
According to dos Santos et al. (2016), the GFCF variable in machinery and equipment is the 
measure  that  best  represents  the  investment  dynamics,  given  the  general  GFCF  profile  of  the 
Brazilian  economy.  In  fact,  starting  from  the  decomposition  of  GFCF  into  machinery  and 
equipment and into construction, according to the methodology of Carvalho and Ribeiro (2014), it 
is  possible  to  measure  the  investment  dynamics  of  non-financial  corporations,  the  latter  being 
responsible for a preponderant part of the general GFCF of the Brazilian economy. 

 In this sense, given the empirical strategy described in the next section, we chose to use the 
following variables, all in logarithmic terms, in our autoregressive models: (i) GFCF in machines 
and  equipment  (GFCF_ME);  (ii)  GFCF  of  public  administration  (GFCF_PA);  (iii)  international 
commodity price index (COMM); and (iv) the real effective exchange rate (REER). Figure A.1, in 
the Appendix, shows the evolution of the series, in log-levels and seasonally adjusted by the X-13 
Arima method, using quarterly data between 1996 and 2018. 

It  is  worth  highlighting  that  due  to  the  different  methodologies  for  calculating  GFCF  in 
Brazil  in  each  of  its  components,  it  can  be  assumed  that  public  investment  data  is  not 
contemporaneously  related  to  the  data  of  other  investment  components.  The  calculation  of  the 
general indicator gives greater weight to the information calculated on the supply side. On the other 
hand, the GFCF indicator of the PA uses a view of the demand of the public administrations for 
investment goods, under the cash regime3.  

Regarding  to  the  stationarity  of  the  series,  the  Augmented  Dickey-Fuller  (ADF)  tests, 
Dickey and Fuller (1981), were performed. The tests point to the same result of non-stationarity of 
the level series, being stationary in the first differences. Thus, it is assumed that all the series used 
are I (1), according to the statistics provided in Table A.1 of the Appendix. 

Given  that  the  mentioned  series  are  not  stationary,  we  proceeded  with  Johansen's  (1991) 
cointegration tests, as can be seen on Table 1. In this case, the variables listed above were grouped 
into  three  models  in  which  the  impacts  of  the  real  effective  exchange  rate  (REER)  and  public 
investment (GFCF_PA) on private investment (GFCF_ME) were taken individually at first (Model 
1 and Model 2) and then had their joint impacts analyzed (Model 3).

The results point out that the null hypothesis of non-existence of at least one cointegrating 
vector  can  be  rejected  for  all  models.  In  all  cases,  diagnostic  tests  of  the  model  were  made,  in 
particular,  the  existence  of  autocorrelation,  non-normality  and  heteroscedasticity  in  the  residues 
were  tested.  In  general,  it  was  possible  to  assume  that  model  residues  exhibit  the  desired 
characteristics of non-autocorrelation, homoscedasticity and normality, as can be seen in Table A.2 
of the Appendix. Also, the estimates of the coefficients of the cointegration vectors and the speed of 
adjustments are presented in Tables A.3 and A.4 of the same Appendix.

The empirical model is a standard version of the Structural Vector Error Correction Models 
(SVECM),  as  established  by  Breitung  et  al.  (2004),  which  has  the  following  general 
representation4:

being 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡= (𝑦𝑦1𝑡𝑡,...,𝑦𝑦𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡)  is  a  k  x  1  vector  of  endogenous  variables,  with  k  =  (COMM,  REER, 
REER, GFCF_PA, GFCF_ME) for model 3; 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 is a vector of exogenous or non-modeled stochastic 
variables; 𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡 contains all deterministic terms5; 𝛱𝛱∗ represents the co-integrating vector, identified in 
Table 1 and described in Table A.4, 𝛤𝛤∗,𝐶𝐶∗𝑒𝑒 𝐵𝐵∗ are arrays of parameters in structural form; 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 is a k 
matrix at time 𝛴𝛴𝑣𝑣. The square matrix 𝐴𝐴, of order k, with defined inverse, permits the modeling of 
instantaneous relations between the variables 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡. 
denoted by 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡, are related with the residues from the model by linear relations 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡=𝐵𝐵𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡, where B is 
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡=𝛱𝛱∗𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1+𝛤𝛤1∗𝐴𝐴𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1+⋯+𝛤𝛤𝑝𝑝−1∗ 𝐴𝐴𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−𝑝𝑝+1+𝐵𝐵𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡,                       (2)

𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡=𝐴𝐴−1𝐵𝐵𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡,                                                          (3) 
which relates the disturbances of the reduced form (𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡) to the underlying structural shocks (𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡). 

Since we are looking for structural shocks, which are not directly observed, it is necessary to 
adopt  assumptions  to  identify  them.  Thus,  it  is  assumed  that  structural  shocks  or  innovations, 

For the analysis of impulse response of non-stationary models in the form of VECM it is 
known that from Johansen's version of Granger's Representation Theorem, according to Johansen 
                                                            
4 Implementation of the empirical model was performed through the VARS package of R, following Pfaff (2008). 
5 For all models we use impulse dummy variables, avoiding structural breaks as observed in 1999:Q1, change in the 
exchange policy, 2008:Q04 the financial crises, or 2015:Q1 associated with political crises observed in Brazil at that 
time.  

For  our  current  proposition,  the  deterministic  terms  and  the  exogenous  variables  can  be 

ignored, turning equation 1 into the following equation:

Notice  that 𝛯𝛯  has  rank (𝐾𝐾 – 𝑟𝑟)  if  the  given  cointegration  is 𝑟𝑟.  Thus,  this  methodology 
permits the estimation of the short and long-term effects, since matrix 𝛯𝛯 represents the long-term 
effects of the impulse response functions (IRFs), while 𝛯𝛯𝑗𝑗∗ contains the transitory effects.  
The  IRFs  based  on 𝛯𝛯  and  on 𝛯𝛯𝑗𝑗∗  are  subject  to  the  same  criticism  than  structural  VAR 
analysis. If 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 is substituted by 𝐴𝐴−1𝐵𝐵𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡, the orthogonalized "short-term" impulse responses can be 
obtained  as 𝛯𝛯𝑗𝑗∗𝐴𝐴−1𝐵𝐵,  in  a  manner  analogous  to  the  stationary  VAR.  In  addition,  the  long-term 
𝛯𝛯 𝐴𝐴−1𝐵𝐵                                                                        (5) 

In  the  context  of  the  models  to  be  estimated,  it  is  assumed  that  international  commodity 
prices are not influenced by contemporaneous shocks to the real exchange rate, public investment 
and investment in machinery and equipment. On the other hand, the exchange rate is affected only 
by contemporary shocks to international commodities prices. Shocks in commodity prices and the 
exchange  rate  affect  public  investment  and  investment  in  machinery  and  equipment  at  the  same 
time. It is also assumed that shocks in public investment affect the investment in machinery and 
equipment. This strategy for identification guarantees a just-identification of the models, generating 
constraints only in the matrix of transitory effects. The estimated matrices of contemporary impacts 
(B) and long-term (ΞB) are presented in Table A.5 of the Appendix. Also, over-identification tests 
were evaluated, and the results presented in the Appendix, Table A.6.

3.  RESULTS OF THE MODELS 

 

 

In line with the proposed objectives, three autoregressive models were estimated, exploring 
the influence of international commodity prices on the dynamics of investments in machinery and 
equipment in Brazil. According to the IMF report (2015)6, gains in commodity terms of trade affect 
macroeconomics through two channels, mainly: income and investment. On the scope of income, 
the boom of commodity prices creates unexpected revenue, since more revenue is generated with no 
increase in the level of production. A higher income increases domestic demand and thus stimulates 
domestic production. As the unexpected income is generated by more favorable terms of trade, the 
response of real domestic production is more moderate than that of income and domestic demand. 
Consistent with the effect of the Dutch disease, the response of domestic supply to the increase in 
domestic income occurs disproportionately in the sector of non-tradable goods because the demand 
for tradable goods can be partly satisfied by an increase in imports. In the process, the prices of 
goods  and  services  that  are  relatively  scarce  and  non-tradable  increase  relative  to  the  prices  of 
tradable goods, and the real exchange rate increases.  

On the scope of investment, the raise in commodity prices increases the incentives to invest 
in  commodities  and  support  industries  -  such  as  construction,  transportation,  and  logistics.  The 
resulting increase in economic activity ultimately generates spillovers for the rest of the economy 
and further increases incomes. Moreover, in the medium term, the increase in commodity supply 
can reverse the boom in commodity prices, contributing to the commodity cycle itself.  

                                                            
6 Other good description of transmission channels of the commodity cycles can be found in Fornero et al. (2016).

In this way, three models are presented. First, according to Model 1, the channel between 
international commodity prices, effective real exchange rate and private investment was explored. 
Model 2 seeks to explore the role of public investment in private investment by isolating the effect 
of the exchange rate. Finally, according to Model 3, these relations are estimated together. It is also 
worth noting that in the structural approach used here, in addition to the Cholesky Decomposition, 
over-identification tests were performed, according to Table A.6 of the Appendix. 

 

 

3.1. IMPULSE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS (IRFS) 

 
Functions  were  obtained  by  the  simulation  of  a  standard  deviation  shock  of  each  of  the 
variables in the models over investment in machinery and equipment. The IRFs of Figures 3.1 to 
3.10  were  calculated  with  95%  confidence  intervals  constructed  by  bootstrapping,  from  two 
thousand simulations. The IRFs 3.11 to 3.14 present the average values of the impulse of each of 
the variables in each model, in order to have a comparative effect of the answers according to the 
model that was analyzed. 

Analyzing  IRFs,  a  shock  of  a  standard  deviation  in  international  commodity  prices  
(COMM)  results  in  a  positive  impact  on  investment  (GFCF_ME),  within  the  95%  confidence 
interval  limit.  The  impact  is  of  about  2%  in  the  index  of  machinery  and  equipment  in  the  first 
quarter, and it stabilizes in a long-term equilibrium, with persistent effect of 7.5% after 17 quarters 
for Model 1. For Model 2, the persistent effect converges more rapidly to a rate of 5.5% after 7 
quarters and for Model 3, this convergence occurs after 9 quarters to about 5.96%. 

IRFs of a standard deviation devaluation at the real effective exchange rate (REER), result in 
a negative impact on investment (GFCF_ME) all within the 95% confidence interval. For Models 1 
and 3, exchange rate shock results in initial shocks of -1.6% and -1.0%, respectively, on investment 
in machinery and equipment. These shocks converge to the long-term equilibrium with a permanent 
effect of -6.0% and -2.3%, after, respectively, 20 and 10 quarters. 

Shocks of a standard deviation of public investment (GFCF_PA) result in a positive average 
impact  on  investment  in  machinery  and  equipment.  For  Models  2  and  3,  the  public  investment 
shock results in initial 1.1% and 1.5% impact on the investment in machinery and equipment. This 
shock converges to the long-term equilibrium with permanent average effects of 1.5% and 3.7%, 
after, respectively, 7 and 8 quarters.

IRFs of an  investment shock on  machines and equipment  in Models 1, 2 and 3, result in 
initial impacts of 3.8%, 4.3% and 3.9% on the same variable. These shocks tend to converge to the 
long-term  equilibrium  with  average  permanent  effects  of  1.1%  and  4.6%  and  2.5%,  after, 
respectively, 13, 7 and 8 quarters. It is interesting to notice the profile of the response functions, 
given  the  cointegration  vector,  where  an  excess  of  investment  relative  to  long-term  equilibrium 
results in a lower growth rate at a later time, which causes the oscillating profile of the IRFs. 

For  the  average  impulses,  as  presented  in  Figures  3.11  to  3.14,  in  general,  the  following 
initial conclusions emerge: (i) positive relation between international commodity prices and private 
investment in machinery and equipment; (ii) the real exchange rate seems to be inversely related to 
private  investment;  and  (iii)  public  investment  exerted  a  complementary  influence  on  private 
investment, that is, it had a crowding in effect on investment in machinery and equipment. 

3.2. ANALYSIS OF THE FORECAST ERROR VARIANCE DECOMPOSITION 

 
In  order  to  evaluate  the  relative  importance  of  each  model´s  variable  shocks  over  private 
investment in machinery and equipment, we use the decomposition of variance of the forecast error 
of this variable, as seen in Table 2. According to our estimates, errors related to the investment itself 
dominate the forecasting error in the short-term, but from the fourth quarter onwards, changes in 
commodity prices are the dominant source of investment dynamics. 

For Model 1, it can be observed that shocks in the private investment variables (GFCF_ME) 
account  for  more  than  84%  in  the  variation  of  this  variable  in  the  first  quarter.  However,  this 
proportion drops to about 26% after 4 quarters and in the long run accounts for less than 5% of the 
variances. A contrary move occurs with commodity price shocks, which in the long run account for 
61%  of  the  variance  of  private  investment  in  machinery  and  equipment.  Still,  shocks  to  the  real 
exchange rate represent 35.6% of the changes in investment after 24 quarters. 

It  is  worth  noting  the  small  influence  of  public  sector  investment,  for  Model  2,  on  the 
forecast error of the variables under study, accounting for 4.1% of the variation in machinery and 
equipment after 24 quarters. In Model 3, which includes exchange rate and public investment in the 
same model, shows a behavior similar to previous models, emphasizing that although the forecast 
errors  of  commodity  prices  still  dominate  the  investment  variance,  this  relationship  decreases 
considerably when compared to Model 1, standing at 55.5% of private investment variance.

3.3. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 

 
In all the estimated models we observe a consistent relationship in which commodity price 
levels have an effect on the real exchange rate, which in turn impact both private investment and 
public investment. The dynamics behind a positive commodity price shock is intuitive - it acts as an 
income shock that increases consumer demand for domestic goods, increasing its relative price and 
appreciating  the  currency.  Increased  absorption  through  consumption  creates  incentives  for  the 
investment  goods  sector,  positively  stimulating  the  demand  and  price  of  capital  goods,  and  as 
domestic goods become relatively more expensive, exports, unlike commodities, fall. This situation 
creates a procyclical and volatile consumption and investment situation according to Fernandez et 
al. (2018). 

With respect to IRFs, we find that: (i) there is a positive and significant relationship between 
commodity  prices  and  investment  in  machinery  and  equipment;  (ii)  the  real  exchange  rate  has  a 
negative and significant relationship with the investment in machinery and equipment; and (iii) in 
most simulations, public investment had a complementary influence on private investment, that is, it 
had a crowding in effect on investment in machinery and equipment. These results are aligned with 
those obtained by most specialized literature. As an example, Cavalcanti et al. (2014), Fernandez et 
al.  (2018),  Fornero  et  al.  (2016),  IMF  (2015)  and  dos  Santos  et  al.  (2016).  In  Fernandez  et  al. 
(2018), we find that country-specific commodity prices in the small emerging market economies are 
procyclical  and  lead  the  cycle  of  production,  consumption  and  investment.  In  addition,  real 
exchange rates and external risk premium measures are countercyclical.  

In  dos  Santos  et  al.  (2016)  we  find  similar  results  for  the  negative  relationship  between 
investment and real exchange rate. According to the authors, "equally complex and controversial is 
the  negative  relationship  between  the  real  exchange  rate  and  the  GFCF  verified  in  the  quarterly 
data". The transmission channels of would be: (i) cost of investment, reducing the cost of capital 
goods  imports;  ii)  exchange  rate  appreciation, which  would  generate  a  relaxation of  the  external 
constraint,  making  monetary  policy  more  flexible  and,  therefore,  a  greater  growth  of  aggregate 
demand; and (iii) the balance sheet and wealth effect according to Krugman (1999) and Allen et al. 
(2010),  for  which  a  high  share  of  the  companies'  external  indebtedness,  with  relevant  currency 
mismatches in the composition of their assets and liabilities, in the event of a currency depreciation 
could negatively affect the balance sheet and/or the profitability of a company. 

Aligned  with  the  results  found  in  Fornero  et  al.  (2016)  and  Fernandez  et  al.  (2018), 
commodity  price  shocks  on  investment  are  persistent  across  all  three  estimated  models.  In  this 
sense, the authors understand that, when shocks are persistent, the response of investment and real 
GDP are amplified. In our estimates, a shock of a standard deviation in commodities results in a 
persistent growth in the level of private investment of around 6%. 

Relative to the shocks in the real exchange rate over private investments, results indicate that 
there  is  no  negative  relationship  in  contemporary  relationships,  but  there  are  persistent  negative 
effects, which indicate convergence with a drop in the level of private investment by approximately 

 

10 

2% after 10 quarters, according to results of Model 3. 

Shocks  of  a  standard  deviation  of  public  investment  on  private  investment  result  in  an 
average  positive  impact  on  the  latter.  Returning  to  dos  Santos  et  al.  (2016),  we  observe  similar 
results, since these authors find a positive, complementary relationship between private investment 
and  public  investment.  .  In  our  estimates,  a  shock  of  a  standard  deviation  in  public  investments 
results in a persistent growth in the level of private investment of around 4%. 

The importance of commodity shocks on the dynamics of investment in Brazil is reinforced 
by the analysis of the decomposition of variation of the forecast error. In this analysis, all results 
indicated that variations in commodities are the dominant source of private investment dynamics in 
machinery and equipment, accounting for approximately 53% of the variance of private investment 
as of the 8th quarter, according to the results of Model 3. 

4.  CONCLUSION 

 

 

This study analyzes the impact of shocks in international commodity prices on the level of 
public investment and on machinery and equipment investment, which is mainly private, for Brazil. 
We can enlist the main results as: first, a rise in commodity prices causes an expansionary effect on 
the economy, aligned with previous studies for other commodity exporting countries. In this sense, 
the  higher  income  from  the  increase  in  the  exported  value,  generated  through  higher  commodity 
prices,  increases  domestic  demand  and,  therefore,  stimulates  domestic  production.  Part  of  this 
expansion is caused by the positive and delayed effect on investment in commodity sectors that may 
overflow into other sectors producing non-tradable goods; second, shocks on the real exchange rate 
have negative effects on investment. In this case, as the unexpected income is generated by more 
favorable terms of trade, the response of real domestic production is more moderate than that of 
domestic demand income. Consistent with the effect of the Dutch disease, the response of domestic 
supply to the increase in domestic income occurs disproportionately in the sector of non-tradable 
goods, because the demand for tradable goods can be partially offset by increased imports, leading 
to  a  deficit in current transactions. Concomitantly  to this  process,  prices  of  relatively  scarce  and 
non-tradable  goods  and  services  increase  relative  to  the  prices  of  tradable  goods,  and  the  real 
exchange rate appreciates; and finally, according to the forecast error variance decomposition, in 
fact the shocks in commodities have been the fundamental determinants of the investment dynamics 
in Brazil. 

These  results,  only  recently  debated  in  the  Brazilian  academic  environment,  show  the 
dynamics of investment and economic growth are strongly subject to external agents. Results for 
exchange rate shocks also play an interesting role in the current economic debate in Brazil. On one 
hand,  according  to  the  causal  mechanisms  mentioned  here,  a  shock  in  commodity  prices  end  up 
causing an appreciation of the exchange rate, since part of the higher domestic demand could be 
supplied by the importation of tradable goods, in line with the process of the Dutch disease cited by 
Bresser-Pereira (2008, 2010). On the other hand, the effect of the appreciation of the exchange rate 
is  that  it  increases  private  investment,  either  by  the  lower  cost  of  imports,  by  the  softening  of 
monetary policy or by the balance sheet effect of companies. In this case, clearly there are winning 
and losing sectors within this process that the aggregate analysis developed here ends up masking. 
A possible path of research could study the determinants of investment in a sectoral way, trying to 
show how different sectors respond to these transmission mechanisms. 

In  such  way,  we  observe  that  the  obtained  results  emphasize  the  external  influence  on 
investment dynamics in Brazil, and its correlation with the known "chicken flights" of the Brazilian 
economy appear naturally. In that sense, Gruss (2014) warned that the end of the commodity price 
boom  would  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  growth  of  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  (LAC) 
commodity-exporting countries. Even more interesting is to observe the author's recommendations 
at that time: "With the economic slowdown linked to the end of the commodity super cycle, the use 

 

11 

of demand stimulators to maintain growth at the recently observed high rates would not be justified 
and could lead to problematic macroeconomic imbalances." He also suggested that policymakers in 
these economies should work to weaken the link between commodity prices and economic activity 
in order to avoid the expansion and recession dynamic often associated with past commodity cycles. 
In this sense, a recommendation that emerges from this research is that if a fiscal policy is 
conducted with a countercyclical fiscal rule, it can help reducing commodity shocks. On the other 
hand,  in  the  absence  of  a  fiscal  rule  or  in  the  existence  of  pro-cyclical  rules,  governments  can 
amplify the effect of the business cycle originated from shocks on the commodity terms of trade. 
Economic reforms with the goal of constructing mechanisms that act as a cushion for these cycles 
and that help the growth of the potential GDP could be extremely useful to countries like Brazil, 
minimizing  the  occurrence  of  the  "chicken  flights"  associated  to  the  expansion  and  recession 
dynamics  originated  from  the  commodity  cycles.  The  Chilean  model  should  be  a  reference  to 
policymakers, where a formal countercyclical fiscal structure was adopted, determined by natural 
resource  revenues,  and  a  stabilization  fund  was  created  to  minimize  the  volatility  of  public 
expenditure.

the series has unit root. To define the number of lags for the ADF test was used the Akaike Info Criterion (AIC).. 
The critical values are: a) no trend: 1% = -3.51; 5% = -2.89; 10% = -2.51; and b) with a tendency: 1% = -4,04; 
5%  =  -3.45;  10%  =  -3.15..  ***  Rejection  of  the  null  hypothesis  at  the  1%  level;  **  Rejection  of  the  null
