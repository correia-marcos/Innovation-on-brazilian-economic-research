Abstract 
This study evaluates the different patterns of insertion of Brazil into value chains. Thus, the regional 
and global insertion patterns are analyzed through the geographic extension of the production stages. 
For this purpose, the value added is decomposed using an intercountry input-output model for the 
period  from  1990  to  2015.  The  main  results  show  that  the  insertion  into  the  value  chains  occurs 
differently when considering their  geographical scope and their forward and backward production 
stages.  The  insertion  of  Brazil  in  value  chains  is  driven  mainly  by  the  global  fragmentation  of 
production. However, regional insertion has increased more than global insertion.

Resumo 
Este estudo avalia os diferentes padrões de participação do Brasil nas cadeias de valor. Assim, os 
padrões de inserção regional e  global são analisados através da extensão  geográfica das etapas de 
produção.  Para  este  propósito,  o  valor  adicionado  é  decomposto  usando  um  modelo  de  insumo-
produto interpaíses para o período de 1990 a 2015. Os principais resultados mostram que a inserção 
nas cadeias de valor ocorre de maneira diferente quando se considera seu escopo geográfico e suas 
etapas de produção para frente e para trás. A inserção do Brasil nas cadeias de valor é impulsionada 
principalmente pela fragmentação global da produção. No entanto, a inserção regional tem aumentado 
mais do que a inserção global.

1. Introduction 
 

Brazil has undergone productive restructuring in the last decades. This restructuring is marked 
by a rapid reduction in the share of the processing industry in the national product. In the same period, 
industrial policies have been directed at increasing domestic value added in production and reducing 
Brazil's  insertion  in  global  value  chains  as  a  way  of  encouraging  industrialization  through  the 
protection of the national industry (Sturgeon et al., 2014). Thus, the efforts made through industrial 
policies have been aimed at promoting national vertically–integrated industries producing all stages 
of production. 

The policy to keep Brazil away from global value chains has been put into practice with high 
import tariffs and incentives for the acquisition of intermediate domestic inputs (Baumann and Kume, 
2013). Thus, the recent commercial and industrial policies in Brazil have worked against a greater 
insertion in global value chains—although the intensification of international production outsourcing 
is  a  tendency  by  the  rest  of  the  world  economies  (Grossman  and  Helpman,  2005)  and  one  of  the 
factors that contribute to competitiveness in the world economy (Timmer et al., 2013).

Guilhoto and Imori (2014) and Ferraz, Gutierre and Cabral (2015) identified a trend of greater 
insertion of Brazil in the value chains for the period between 1995 and 2011. The authors also verified 
that Brazil is one of the worldwide leaders in the share of domestic value added in its exports. While 
Los, Timmer and de Vries (2015) analyzed the 40 largest economies in the world, they showed an 
upward trend of the foreign value-added share in the international trade. 

Brazil's commercial and  industrial policies since the 1970s have been oriented towards the 
formation  of  a  vertically  integrated  national  industrial  park  and  the  establishment  of  all  stages  of 
production.  Thus,  these  policies  have  been  formulated  to  preserve  Brazil's  limited  exposure  to 
imports, with a strong protectionist tendency (Veiga and Rios, 2017a). The main instrument of this 
trade policy is the collection of high import tariffs (Messa and Oliveira, 2017). Tariff barriers have a 
significant effect on blocking trade in value chains, as intermediate inputs cross national borders many 
times  before  they  become  final  products.  This  characteristic  of  the  Brazilian  economy,  besides 
reducing  its  participation  in  global  value  chains,  may  have  effects  on  its  productivity.  The  World 
Bank (2018) suggests that being the most closed country among the world's major economies is one 
reason  for  the  low  growth  of  Brazilian  productivity.  This  may  be  related  to  the  lack  of  external 
competition and the blocking of access to new knowledge and technologies through the import of 
machinery and equipment. 

The stimulus to industrialization, focusing on all stages of production in the national territory, 
has therefore been one of the priorities of the Brazilian political agenda. However, this policy has not 
been  effective  in  controlling  the  reduction  of  the  manufacturing  industry's  share  of  the  country's 
output. The share of manufacturing in products has also been reduced in other countries. For example, 
after declining over four decades, manufacturing reached 12.0% in the US and 15.9% in the European 
Union in 2015—with the exception of fast–growing Asian economies such as China and South Korea, 
with numbers close to 30.0% (Peneder and Streicher, 2018). Meanwhile, Latin American countries 
were hit harder by deindustrialization (Rodrik, 2016).  

In the case of Brazil, the share of manufacture in total production reached around 25.0% in 
1986 and declined to 16.0% in 1996 (Bonelli et  al., 2013). During this period, Brazil reduced the 
nominal  average  import  tariff  from  57.5%  in  1987  to  11.2%  in  1994  (Veiga  and  Rios,  2017a). 
Although the country has progressively increased this tariff in the last two decades, to around 32.0% 
(Castilho and Miranda, 2017), and established policies to encourage the domestic industry, it has not 
managed  to  reverse  this  decline;  in  2015,  only  12.2%  of  Brazilian  value  added  originated  in  the 
manufacturing industry (IBGE, 2017). In addition, imports of final goods were the ones that increased 
the most in the last decade. This shows the loss of competitiveness of the Brazilian industry and the 
difficulties to increase productivity (Ferreira and Silva, 2015; Jacinto and Ribeiro, 2015),  which has 
not been able to compensate for the high internal costs of production despite the protectionist policies.  
Brazil's  industrial  and  commercial  policies  over  the  last  two  decades  have  been  aimed  at 
stimulating exports through public financing of production investments (with negative real interest 
rates  for  some  selected  activities)  and  tax  incentives  for  exporting  companies  (Veiga  and  Rios, 
2017a).  Thus,  Brazilian  trade  policy  has  been  formulated  to  stimulate  exports,  while  maintaining 
reduced  exposure  of  the  domestic  industry  to  international  competitors.  However,  Taglioni  and 
Winkler (2016) and Lindé and Pescatori (2017) have shown that this type of policy is not effective in 
stimulating exports in the context of international fragmentation of production. Thereby, in Brazil, 
although commercial and industrial policies aim to reduce the exposure of the domestic industry to 
the  external  market  and  stimulate 
the  country  has  experienced 
deindustrialization. In this perspective, Peneder and Streicher (2018) show that traditional industrial 
policies, in a context of intensifying production in global value chains and in contrast to the objectives 
of the policies, tend to accelerate deindustrialization.  

its  competitiveness, 

Besides, the pattern of insertion of the Brazilian economy in international trade is marked by 
distinct  characteristics  when  considering  its  global  or  regional  integration.  Brazilian  exports  have 
become  resource–intensive,  while  exports  to  South  America  consist  mainly  of  machinery  and 
equipment  (Brasil,  2017).  The  countries  of  South  America,  because  they  are  characterized  by 
common linkages of trade and investment, are considered as the regional trade bloc of Brazil in this

analysis.1 The last significant trade agreements of Brazil were established with the countries of South 
America, with the creation of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) in 1991 (agreement between 
Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay), the trade agreement between Mercosur, Chile and Bolivia 
in 1996 and between Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru in 2003. Since then, Brazil has been relatively 
closed  to  new  trade  agreements  (Thorstensen  and  Ferraz,  2014).  Although  there  have  been 
negotiations,  since  the  2000s,  Brazil's  main  agreements  have  been  established  only  with  Mexico, 
India and South Africa, and they cover a limited group of products (Castilho and Miranda, 2017).  

Although imports and exports within the South American continent accounted for only 20.0% 
of Brazil's total foreign trade over the past two decades, the formulation of the Brazilian trade policy 
has  been  focused  on  agreements  with  South  American  countries.  This  policy  has  been  conceived 
under the understanding that Brazil’s insertion in value chains occurs mainly through the regional 
fragmentation of production (Veiga and Rios, 2017b)—although this hypothesis is not formulated 
based on empirical evidence. 

Despite the need to understand the shift in the patterns of the international fragmentation of 
production,  most  of  the  studies  conducted  previously  for  the  Brazilian  economy  are  focused  on 
discussing value  chains  based on evidence supported by  gross export statistics, even though these 
statistics  are  not  very  informative  in  identifying  value–added  trade  in  internationally  fragmented 
production (Johnson and Noguera, 2012a; Koopman, Wang and Wei, 2014). Dietzenbacher, Guilhoto 
and  Imori  (2013),  Guilhoto  and  Imori  (2014),  Ferraz,  Gutierre  and  Cabral  (2015),  Callegari  et  al. 
(2018)  and  Magacho  et  al.  (2018),  who  analyze  the  insertion  of  Brazil  in  the  global  value  chains 
through the trade of value added, are exceptions. 

Therefore, this study evaluates the different patterns of insertion of Brazil into value chains. 
Thereby, this analysis performs a spatial decomposition of foreign value added. This decomposition 
is done taking into account the backward and forward segments of value chains. The regional and 
global  insertion  patterns  in  the  value  chains  are  analyzed  through  the  geographic  extension  of  the 
stages of production. For this, the value added is decomposed using the intercountry input–output 
model for the period from 1990 to 2015. This period of analysis allows us to evaluate the insertion 
into global value chains in the face of different scenarios of changes in the commercial and industrial 
policies of Brazil. This study can help to understand the recent changes in the country’s productive 
structure. 

The  paper,  in  addition  to  this  introduction  section,  is  structured  as  follows.  Section  two 
discusses the growth of  global trade in the context of vertical specialization and the challenges of 
measuring the insertion of countries into global production chains. Section three presents the vertical 
specialization measures used in this study. Section four informs the source of the data used in the 
analysis. Section five presents and discusses the results. Finally, section six provides the conclusions 
and suggestions for policy–making. 

 

2. International fragmentation of production and value–added trade 
 
 
International  trade  can  enable  countries  to  achieve  higher  levels  of  production  and 
consumption  (Gandolfo,  2014).  International  trade  can  stimulate  the  most  efficient  distribution  of 
resources  in  the  world  market  by  outsourcing  production  to  global  production  chains  (Yi,  2003; 
Grossman  and  Rossi–Hansberg,  2008).  The  international  outsourcing  of  production  is  related  to 
companies’ decision to carry out part of their productive stages abroad. These stages may involve the 

                                                 
1  There  is  no  multilateral  trade  agreement  that  includes  all  the  countries  of  South  America.  Although  there  are  two 
multilateral  agreements,  the  Union  of  South  American  Nations  (UNASUR)  and  the  Integration  of  South  American 
Regional Infrastructure (IIRSA), a free trade area among the countries of the region has not been established. IIRSA is a 
joint program of the governments of UNASUR countries with the objective of building infrastructure in the continent. 
UNASUR  is  comprised  of  12  countries  and  provides  for  the  replacement  of  the  economic  cooperation  blocs  of  the 
Southern Common Market (Mercosur) between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela, and the Andean 
Community of Nations (CAN), composed of Ecuador and Peru. The other countries that make up UNASUR are Chile, 
Guyana and Suriname.

physical production of goods, through the acquisition of intermediate inputs, or services performed 
at  a  distance,  such  as  information  technology  and  human  resources  (Yamashita,  2010).  This 
international  fragmentation  tends  to  make  countries  specialize  in  specific  stages  of  vertically 
integrated value chains (Jones, 2000; Hummels, Ishii and Yi, 2001). 

The  international  fragmentation  of  production  is  a  strategy  to  increase  industrial 
competitiveness and it has provided the intensification of offshoring in recent decades for two main 
reasons. First, due to technological progress, which allows for the separation of production processes 
and  the  continuous  reduction  of  transport  costs  (Hummels,  2007).  Second,  due  to  coordination 
capacity through governance in value chains (Gereffi et al., 2005). In addition, the liberalization of 
international  trade,  through  tariff  reduction  policies,  also  contributes  to  the  expansion  of 
fragmentation  across  national  boundaries  (Yi,  2003).  Overall,  increased  international  outsourcing 
reduces production costs and adds more stages to global value chains (Yamashita, 2010).  

The  intensification  of  the  international  fragmentation  of  production  chains  has  altered  the 
structure of global trade in recent decades (Yi, 2003). This international fragmentation is defined by 
the specialization of countries at specific stages of vertically integrated production chains—referred 
to as vertical specialization (Hummels, Ishii and Yi, 2001). Thus, bilateral trade in goods has mainly 
occurred to connect the different stages of these global chains. This has allowed companies to transfer 
part of their production to cheaper locations abroad (Baldwin and Venables, 2013).  

The vertical specialization of production has posed challenges to the theoretical modeling of 
international trade (Yi (2003), Grossman and Rossi–Hansberg (2008) and Antràs and Chor (2013)), 
as well as to empirical modeling (Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001), Koopman, Wang and Wei (2014), 
Johnson and Noguera (2012a) and Los, Timmer and de Vries (2016)). This happens because, in the 
context  of  vertical  specialization,  trade  statistics,  measured  in  gross  terms,  include  inputs  that  are 
added in the early stages of production in other countries. Thus, the total volume of gross trade is 
different from the sum of the value added by each country at different stages of production. Johnson 
and Noguera (2012a), Koopman, Wang and Wei (2014) and Los, Timmer and de Vries (2016) show 
that the vertical specialization of production requires the use of specific measures to estimate each 
country's contribution to international trade.  

Therefore,  the  importance  of  international  trade,  as  measured  by  gross  measures,  may  be 
overestimated because of the double counting of intermediate goods crossing national borders more 
than  once  (Koopman,  Wang  and  Wei,  2014).2  Analyses  to  measure  participation  in  global  value 
chains mainly use the input–output methodology and start from the work of Hummels, Ishii and Yi 
(2001) and subsequent contributions made by Johnson and Noguera (2012a), Antràs et al. (2012), 
Koopman, Wang and Wei (2014), Los, Timmer and de Vries (2015) and Gurgul and Lach (2018). 
The input–output analysis allows us to track all production chains through the structure of industrial 
interdependence and thus to account for the direct and indirect participation of each country in the 
global production, taking into account all stages of global value chains. 

The  vertical  specialization  measures,  calculated  in  the  input–output  approach,  take  as  a 
starting  point  that  production  involves  a  sequential  chain  of  trade,  which  extends  across  many 
countries,  with  each  country  specializing  in  a  particular  stage  of  production.  The  first  vertical 
specialization measure proposed by Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001) estimates the imported content in 
exports  under  the  assumption  that  these  exports  are  fully  absorbed  abroad.  This  measure  of 
specialization excludes the scenarios in which production incorporates imported goods that countries 
produced in the early stages of value chains. Thus, Daudin, Rifflart and Schweisguth (2011), Johnson 
and Noguera (2012a and 2012b), Timmer et al. (2013), Koopman, Wang and Wei (2014) and Los, 
Timmer and de Vries (2016), using information for the trade flows specified in interregional input–
output tables, extend the vertical specialization measure of Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001) from the 
value–added content to different decompositions. 

                                                 
2 The double counting in the gross trade statistics originates from exports that can return to the country of origin in the 
form  of  final  goods  or  intermediate  inputs;  in  the  case  of  intermediate  inputs,  these  can  be  used  at  other  stages  of 
production and re–exported (Koopman et al., 2014).

Input–output  analysis,  in  addition  to  measuring  foreign  value  added  content,  allows  the 
identification of the geographic extent of global value chains and the formation of agglomerations of 
countries at specific stages of production. The regional agglomeration of activities in value chains is 
driven by the formation of regional trade blocs, which reduce trade barriers preferentially between 
neighboring countries (Johnson and Noguera, 2017).  

The  geographical  extent  of  global  production  chains  is  analyzed  by  Johnson  and  Noguera 
(2012a), Baldwin and Lopez–Gonzalez (2015) and Los, Timmer and de Vries (2015), which present 
evidence that vertical specialization has different patterns between countries and sectors of activity. 
Thus,  although  some  industries  locate  their  assembly  activities  close  to  the  final  markets—with 
specialized  suppliers  tending  to  cluster  in  their  surroundings—other  industrial  activities  are 
characterized  by  dispersed  production  around  the  world.  Thereby,  international  fragmentation  can 
occur  essentially  through  trade  in  the  regional  context,  i.e.,  in  groups  of  geographically  close 
countries,  or  in  the  global  context,  i.e.,  involving  geographically  distant  countries  (Backer, 
Lombaerde and Iapadre, 2018).  

In this perspective, Baldwin and Lopez–Gonzalez (2015) suggest that vertical specialization 
in the 1990s was marked by  regional trade blocs rather than trade in value chains  globally. Thus, 
international  fragmentation  was  concentrated  among  immediate  trading  partners,  geared  to  the 
regional location of trade. In contrast, Los, Timmer and de Vries (2015) show that, in the 2000s, the 
extent  of  the  international  fragmentation1  was  mainly  global,  involving  countries  from  outside  a 
given  region.  The  international  fragmentation  of  production,  in  addition  to  showing  different 
characteristics  in  the  regional  and  global  contexts,  is  also  diverse  when  comparing  forward  and 
backward segments of global value chains—in this case, countries play different roles at different 
levels of value chains (Lejour et al., 2017).  

 

3. Decomposing participation in global production chains 
 

Foreign  value–added  content  is  used  to  evaluate  integration  into  global  value  chains.  The 
contribution of each country in the production chain can be broken down using an intercountry input–
output table. This table contains the values of the flows of intermediate inputs and final goods among 
all the country–industries—i.e., the s industries (s = 1, ..., S) in each of the n countries (n = 1, ..., N). 
By combining information on the values of transactions of intermediate inputs (Z), final demand (F), 
sectoral production (x) and remuneration of primary production factors (w), it is possible to estimate 
the  value  generated  in  each  of  the  SN  industries.  Formally,  these  flows  can  be  represented  by  the 
following matrices and vectors: 

 

(cid:1)≡(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)
(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:5)
  ⋮  
(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:5)

(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:6) ⋯ (cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:12), (cid:13)≡⎝⎛(cid:16)(cid:5)(cid:17)(cid:16)(cid:6)(cid:17)⋮(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:17)⎠⎞, (cid:20)(cid:21)≡(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:5)(cid:23)(cid:6)⋮(cid:23)(cid:8)(cid:24), (cid:25)(cid:21)≡(cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:5)(cid:26)(cid:6)⋮(cid:26)(cid:8)(cid:24) 
(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6) ⋯ (cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:8)
(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:6) ⋯ (cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:8)
   ⋮  
⋮    
  ⋱  

 

 
The market equilibrium condition of the input–output system representation for the SN industry can 

each sector, the production value (x) is equal to the sum of the goods for final (F) and intermediate 
(Z) uses, in the domestic and external markets. The external market is defined by exports from i to j. 
In sectoral production (x), payment is required for the primary factors (w) and intermediate inputs 
(Z) of production. From these elements, it is possible to decompose the intermediate inputs required 

be written in matrix form as (cid:20)′=(cid:13)(cid:29)+(cid:1)(cid:29) and (cid:20)=(cid:25)+(cid:29)′(cid:1). The term (SN x 1) (cid:29) is a sum vector.3 For 
per unit of production, defined in the matrix (cid:31)=(cid:1) (cid:20)!"#(cid:5), and the value added per unit of product, 
defined  in  the  vector $=(cid:25) (cid:20)"#(cid:5).  The  term (cid:20)!  corresponds  to  the  diagonal  matrix  formed  by  the 

vector x.

origin of the production of final goods determines the value chain being  analyzed. The use of the 

Leontief  inverse  matrix,  1−(cid:31)"#(cid:5),  ensures  that  value–added  contributions  at  all  stages  of  supply 

through direct and indirect requirements in the productive chain structure are taken into account. Los,

decomposing the value of a final product by the value–added contributions made in any country.

replication for each country of completion of the final good (cid:16)((cid:17) ’". Value added from the country of 

completion in vector g is set to zero. The sum of the value added provided by each country i for the 
other completion country j is defined as:

3.2. Backward insertion into global chains 
 

In the backward integration—focused on the origin of the value added for the last stage of 
production, that is, the country–of–completion—in global chains, the value added in the final goods 
produced in Brazil is decomposed, following the approach developed in Los, Timmer and de Vries 
(2015). Thus, the vector F of equation (4.2) includes the final demand values only for Brazil, with 
the other cells specified as zero. The value of the final good produced by industry s in Brazil is denoted 

by FINO<.  The  value  added  from  country  j  is  defined  by VA (cid:17)" ’".  The  vector  g  contains  the 
corresponding levels VA (cid:17)" ’" or each final good produced in Brazil (cid:16)((cid:17) ’", such that: 

 

 

The contribution of all countries to the value added used in the production of  %,’" is equal to 
the value of the final product  %,’". The FINO< measure allows for the definition of the value added 

along the production chain in which Brazil is integrated, minus the value added produced in Brazil:

FVAS<=FVA</FINO< 

The term FVA< measures the international fragmentation of production chains.6 FVA<, unlike 
SVA<, defined in Eq. (5), is the sum of the value added from the  N countries in the production of 
country i. SVA<, in turn, is the sum of the contribution of country i in the value added inserted in the

fragmentation  of  the  value  chains  into  which  Brazil  is  inserted.  This  share  is  an  index  that  varies 
between  zero  and  one.  FVAS  assumes  zero  value  when  all  value  added  is  produced  internally,

by  Koopman,  Wang  and  Wei,  (2014),  present  in  the  other  vertical  specialization  metrics  that  use 
intermediate inputs imported into production. 
 
3.3. Regional and global fragmentation of value chains 
 
 
Foreign  value  added,  following  the  proposed  decomposition  in  Los,  Timmer  and  de  Vries 
(2015), is used to define the international fragmentation of production within regional or global blocs 
of trade. The focus of the analysis is the insertion of the Brazilian economy into global value chains. 

In this way, FVA< is decomposed into the foreign value-added share originating in the region in which 
Brazil is included, i.e., regional foreign value added (RFVA<), and the share of the foreign value added 
that is produced geographically distant from Brazil, i.e., global foreign value added (GFVA<). The 
The regional foreign value added in the final good (cid:16)((cid:17) ’" produced in Brazil is defined as the 

countries  of  South  America,  because  they  are  characterized  by  common  linkages  of  trade  and 
investment, are considered as the regional trade bloc of Brazil. 

contribution of the value added of the region to which Brazil belongs minus the contribution of Brazil: 

RFVA<= ? VA(cid:17) ’"

−VA HIJK(L" ’" 

 

 

(cid:17) ∈ IQR(ST
SU HIJK(L
RFVAS<=RFVA</FINO< 

Similarly to Eq. (9), the regional share of FVA< in Brazil's production chains is defined by: 
The  change  over  time  in  the  share  of RFVA<  being  positive  indicates  a  trend  of  regional 
fragmentation of the value chain. Similarly, GFVA< measures the contribution of value added of all 

countries outside the region of Brazil8, as follows: 

(11) 

(10) 

 

 

 

 

                                                 

6 The approach of measuring international fragmentation from FVA< is based on tracking the value chain, starting from 

the final product and tracing the added value, at all stages, needed to produce the final good. 

7 By definition, FVAS cannot be equal to one, because the final stage of production must involve some activity in the 
country of completion of production. 

8 Following the definition of Los, Timmer and Vries (2015), the term global value added is used to define the value added 
that  is  geographically  distant  from  the  location  of  the  last  stage  of  production.  Therefore,  this  measure  should  not  be 
interpreted as value added anywhere in the world, as it would, by definition, be equal to the value of the final product.

4. Database 

 
The regional and global fragmentation of value chains is analyzed using the data provided by 
the  full  EORA  Multi–Regional  Input–Output  Table  (MRIO).  The  construction  of  this  database  is 
described in Lenzen et al. (2012a) and Lenzen et al. (2013a). The full EORA MRIO contains data for 
190 regions of the world, specifying 26 sectors of activity,9 and covers the period from 1990 to 2015.10 
The  data  for  the  construction  of  the  EORA  MRIO  database  are  from  national  statistical  offices. 
Bilateral trade data comes from the UN Comtrade Database and UN Service Trade Database. The 
EORA database assumes that its regional specification sufficiently covers the global economy. 

Changes  in  the  national  accounts  system  may  cause  interruptions  in  the  continuity  of  the 
input–output tables of Brazil estimated by EORA. However,  Lenzen  et  al. (2013b) show that this 
does  not  generate  imbalances  in  sectoral  aggregated  analyzes––the  focus  of  the  present  study.  A 
detailed description of the price corrections and of all the discontinuities and corrections implemented 

                                                 
9 The EORA Multi–Region Input–Output Table (MRIO) provides data from the intercountry input–output table with the 
breakdown of 56 sectors of activity into the Brazilian economy. However, this matrix does not have a harmonized version 
for all world economies, making it impossible to aggregate foreign value added results at the industrial level. 

10 Owen et al. (2016), Steen–Olsen et al. (2016) and Owen (2017) analyzed the results of economic indicators constructed 
from the Interregional Input–Output Tables of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), World Input–Output Database 
(WIOD),  Multi–Region  Input–Output  Table  (EORA)  and  Inter–Country  Input–Output  (OECD–ICIO)  and  found  that 
global added value accounts are similar between these databases, although differences exist at the country and individual 
sector levels.

in the input–output tables for the Brazilian economy, used in the estimation of the full EORA MRIO, 
is found in Lenzen et al. (2012b) and Lenzen et al. (2013b). 

The choice of using the EORA other than other databases of intercountry input–output tables 
is motivated by its complete regional specification for the South American countries. This allows us 
to measure the  geographical origin of all  regional trade flows in Brazil.  In addition, the historical 
series of the full EORA MRIO makes it possible to evaluate the evolution of Brazil’s insertion into 
global value chains. 

 

5. Results 
 

The  measures  of  foreign  value-added  share  (FVAS)  and  Sourcing  are  used  to  quantify  the 
vertical specialization of Brazil and its insertion in regional and global trade blocs. FVAS is a measure 
of backward integration into global chains, that is, in terms of the purchase of inputs. On the other 
hand, the Sourcing measure, defined by the share of value added produced in Brazil in relation to 
total foreign value added in all value chains, evaluates the forward integration in production chains. 
Table 1 shows the distribution of value added in the final goods produced in Brazil in two 
groups: for all activity sectors and for the sectors related to agriculture, mining, manufacturing and 
tradable services.11 Domestic value added measures domestic share in domestic production—that is, 
discounting foreign value added. The regional and global foreign value added (FVAS) in the final 
goods produced in Brazil increased for the two groups of sectors from 1990 to 2015. This suggests 
that  production  in  Brazil  became  more  connected  to  global  value  chains  throughout  this  period, 
although the country has one of the lowest FVAS among world economies—Brazil ranks 157th out 
of 188 countries in terms of foreign value-added share in final products.12

The  Brazilian  commercial  policy,  besides  being  formulated  with  the  objective  of  creating 
barriers to imports, also aims to increase and diversify exports. Therefore, the insertion of Brazil in 
the forward and backward flows of global value chains is expected to occur differently. To measure 
these  diverse  standards  of  insertion,  the  Sourcing  measure  is  used.  This  measure  assesses  the 
importance of the Brazilian economy for global production chains based on the share of value added 
with  origin  in  Brazil  in  relation  to  the  foreign  value  added  included  in  the  final  goods  produced 
anywhere in the world. 

Brazil's contribution to the provision of value added to global production chains is shown in 
Table 2. In 2015, Brazil contributed 1.4% of foreign value added in the final products of all global 

                                                 
11 Non–transactional services are not included in the analysis because their production is not traded internationally. These 
sectors are characterized by services rendered locally. 

12  One  of  the  reasons  for  the  low  FVAS  in  the  Brazilian  economy  is  the  high  import  tariffs  practiced  in  the  country. 
However, this is not the only measure to assess insertion in value chains. For example, the United States and Japan also 
have low FVAS. In this case, it is worth mentioning that FVAS is influenced by the size of the manufacturing industry's 
share of the total product; the stage of technological development of the country and its degree of dependence on imports 
of foreign technologies, in addition to the industrial structure and its productive links with the rest of the world – that is, 
the type of industrial specialization in the country and the stages of production that are outsourced abroad.

The share of value added provision in global value chains (Sourcing) was calculated for each 
industry specified in EORA Multi–Region Input–Output Table (MRIO) database. Sourcing measures 
at  the  industrial  level  are  represented  in  Figure  1,  in  two  dimensions.  A  multidimensional  scaling 
(MDS) technique was used to identify groups of countries with similar patterns of insertion in global 
value chains. In quadrants I and II, the focus is on technology–intensive and specialized countries in 
the final stages of production of global value chains. Quadrant III concentrates resource–intensive 
countries that contribute the most to value in the early stages of global value chains. In quadrant IV, 
in turn, are countries specializing in the production of agricultural goods, mining, and food, wood and 
petrochemical  industries.  Brazil  is  in  an  intermediary  position;  i.e.,  despite  having  a  comparative 
advantage in the production of natural resource–intensive goods, the Brazilian industrial structure is 
diversified and the country is able to participate in value chains in some more advanced stages of 
production.

In  the  ranking  of  188  countries,  which  assesses  share  in  the  supply  of  value  added  for  the 
global production chains, Brazil occupies the 20th position. This pattern of insertion of the Brazilian 
economy can be better understood through the analysis of its regional and global insertion in the next 
section. 
 

5.1. Brazil's regional and global insertion in value chains 

 
Brazil's regional and global patterns of insertion into value chains are analyzed through the 
decomposition of the geographical origin of the value–added trade. Figure 2 shows the decomposition 
of the foreign value added inserted in the Brazilian production originating in the regional and global 
trade blocs, calculated through the RFVAS and GFVAS measures. The regional trade bloc is formed 
by the countries of South America, while the global trade bloc is composed of all the other countries 
that form the global value chains.  

The regional and global backward fragmentation of Brazilian production increased until 2001 
(Figure 2). Starting in 2002, the GFVAS showed a downward trend and the RFVAS remained stable 
until 2009. The regional and global insertion of Brazil showed a tendency to increase from 2010. The 
global trade bloc contributed with 9.0% and the regional–market bloc provided 2.0% of the foreign 
value added in Brazilian production in 2015. The results show that the countries of South America 
have a small share in the production of final goods in Brazil. This result is different from the evidence 
presented by Baldwin and Lopez–Gonzalez (2015), who interpreted the international fragmentation 
of production occurring mainly within regional trade blocs. The result of our study is similar to the 
evidence found by Los, Timmer and de Vries (2015), who identified the global fragmentation of value 
chains as being greater than the regional fragmentation for OECD country groups.

The  increase  in  FVAS  between  1990  and  1993  is  partly  linked  to  the  trade  liberalization 
policy, which reduced the nominal average import tariff from 57.0% in 1987 to 13.0% in 1993. The 
reduction of GFVAS from 2002 onwards may have been caused by the policy of increasing import 
tariffs and encouraging the acquisition of domestic inputs through sectoral public financing schemes 

12 

 

for investment, tax incentives and government procurement (Veiga and Rios, 2017a). In this way, 
Brazil  has  been  practicing  higher  levels  of  import  protection  than  other  developing  countries.  In 
addition, import tariffs are higher on machinery and equipment than tariffs imposed on imports of 
other types of industrial inputs—this trend is contrary to other countries (Baumann and Kume, 2013).  
From  2010  onwards,  Brazilian  trade  and  industrial  policies  have  aimed  at  intensifying  the 
protection of the national industry (Veiga and Rios, 2017a). These policies adopted in Brazil have 
aimed at increasing domestic content in production. However, during this period there has been  a 
growth of imported goods in the manufacturing industry. This justifies the upward trend in GFVAS 
between the years 2010 and 2013 (Figure 2). On the other hand, the policy of encouraging integration 
with South American countries may have contributed to the upward trend of RFVAS. 

The forward integration of Brazil into global value chains in regional and global trade blocs 
is measured by Regional Sourcing and Global Sourcing. Figure 3 shows the evolution of the regional 
and global forward insertion of Brazil in the value chains between 1990 and 2015. The value added 
with origin in Brazil and inserted in the final products of South America (0.24%) and in the rest of 
the world (1.14%) is a measure of the country's contribution to global production chains.  

The evolution of the Sourcing measure shows that the value added produced in Brazil, which 
composes the other countries’ final goods, showed an upward tendency concentrated in three different 
periods: between 1991 and 1993, between 1995 and 1997 and from 2004 (Figure 3). The first period 
refers to the trade liberalization in Brazil. The second period refers to the 38.0% drop in the effective 
real exchange rate, which preceded the change in the country's exchange rate policy. The third point 
corresponds  to  the  42.0%  devaluation  of  the  real  exchange  rate  between  2004  and  2009  and  the 
expansion  of  the  prices  of  natural  resource–intensive  products  in  the  international  market.  Since 
Brazil specializes in exports of these products, this may be related to the increase in the Sourcing 
measure in this period.

Note: Brazil's participation in the final products of all global production chains is presented to the agriculture, mining, 

manufacturing, and tradable sectors, as these sectors are more prone to international fragmentation of production.

Figure  4  shows  the  relative  importance  of  the  regional  insertion  in  relation  to  the  global 
insertion for the activity sectors related to tradable goods between 1990 and 2015. These results allow 
us to identify the change in the pattern of international fragmentation over time. The RFVAS and 
Regional Sourcing have increased in relation to the global share. Therefore, although the Brazilian 

13 

 

insertion in the value chains has been driven mainly by the global fragmentation of production, its 
regional insertion has increased more than its global insertion.  

The value added in Brazilian production is decomposed by country of origin.  For this, the 
MDS technique applied to the FVAS was used for each industry. The results are shown in Figure 
5a—in quadrant I are the countries that provide the most value added from mineral products to Brazil; 
quadrant II concentrates the countries that supply value added in agricultural, mining, textile, food, 
and wood industries; in quadrant III are the countries that are not representative in the supply of value 
added for Brazil; and quadrant IV displays the main value added suppliers concentrated across the 
technology–intensive industries.

in the last stage of production in the other countries of the value chains. In quadrants I and III the 
countries that are not traditional trade partners of Brazil. In quadrant II are the destination countries 
of value–added exports in agricultural products, mining, textile, food, and wood industries. Quadrant 
IV, in turn, presents the destinations for value–added exports in goods that are technology–intensive 
and  closer  to  the  last  stages  of  production  of  value  chains—such  as  machinery  and  electrical 
equipment, metal products, petrochemical industry, and transport equipment. 

The proximity is important in international trade. In a context of international fragmentation 
of  production,  the  connectivity  of  value  chains  is  marked  by  geographical  proximity  and 
agglomeration  of  the  main  production  countries  in  a  few  places,  which  are  the  center  of  globally 
connected regional chains—such as the regional chains with a center in the United States, European 
Union and Southeast Asia (Lejour et al., 2017). Thereby, the economies, even if well structured, with 
relatively low unit labor costs and high connectivity, will have a negative impact on trade if their 
neighbors fall short of the same metrics (World Bank, 2017). Figure 5 shows that Brazil's main trading 
partners in terms of FVAS and Sourcing are geographically distant, with the exception of Argentina. 
This may be a restrictive factor for Brazil to take advantage of the benefits of greater trade integration 
and international fragmentation of production. In addition, the results presented in Figure 5 show that 
the insertion of Brazil into the value chains presents different standards when considering the forward 
and backward stages of the production chains.

similarities (or distances) between each pair of observation (Johnson and Wichern, 2007). For the application of the 

MDS technique, the value–added measure was used for each country by sector of activity. MDS configuration: method 

(modern MDS), loss criterion (stress), transformation (identity).

6. Conclusions 
 

The study performed a spatial decomposition of foreign value added inserted in global value 
chains. This decomposition is done taking into account the forward and backward segments of value 
chains. In this study, the focus of the analysis is the Brazilian economy, since its pattern of insertion 
in international trade has distinct characteristics when considering its global or regional integration. 
This analysis presents new evidence regarding the position that Brazil occupies in the value 
chains and the spatial extent of this productive fragmentation. The main results show that the insertion 
of countries into value chains occurs differently when considering their geographic scope and forward 
and backward production stages. We also find that the forward and backward insertion of Brazil in 
the value chains is driven mainly by the global fragmentation of production. However, the regional 
insertion has increased more than the global insertion.  

Brazil is relatively closed to international trade and little inserted in value chains. Protectionist 
policies  have  been  directed  to  keep  Brazil  away  from  greater  integration  in  value  chains,  with 
incentives for the realization of all stages of production in the national territory. Thus, the Brazilian 
industry has remained little integrated to the international fragmentation of production. In addition, 
the reduced number of trade agreements hinders the country's insertion into the value chains. 

Further integration into global value chains may be an alternative to increase economic growth 
capacity. Although this insertion can promote gains in industrial competitiveness, it can also reduce 
the level of activity in industries with less capacity to compete in the  external market. Thereby, a 
concern of policymakers is the decrease in employment and income levels in specific activities.  

In the context of growing international outsourcing of production, the formulation of industrial 
policies  should  take  into  account  that  the  production  processes  are  increasingly  fragmented  in 
different  territories.  This  affects  how  to  take  advantage  of  a  country's  comparative  advantages  in 
specific stages of the production process. In this context, industrial and commercial policies in Brazil 
are formulated based on two main issues. First, to encourage domestic industry through high import 
tariffs, with the risk of generating a loss of competitiveness and hampering the integration of value 
chains. Second, reducing import tariffs and  encouraging  greater participation in global production 
chains, but at the risk of loss of employment and income in activities where national industries are 
unable to compete with foreign industries.  

It should be borne in mind that there are distant forms of insertion in the global production 
chains, both in relation to the stages of production and to the geographical scope of these production 
chains. Although the Brazilian industry does not have the technological capacity to compete in more 
advanced stages of production of certain industries, the country may have advantages in specializing 
in intermediary stages of these chains in which it is a net exporter of manufactured goods. To do this, 
it is necessary to consider that value chains have a geographical scope—that is, the global value chain 
is formed by several regional production chains.  

Mapping the different dimensions of value chains is an important step for Brazil to identify at 
which  stages  of  production  have  more  comparative  advantages  of  insertion.  Thus,  this  study 
contributes to an increased understanding of Brazil's insertion in the international fragmentation of 
production, which can be useful in the formulation of industrial policies.
