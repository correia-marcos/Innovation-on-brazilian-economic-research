Ivette Luna†

This paper investigates the statistical properties and patterns of Brazilian
manufacturing ﬁrms related to size, productivity, growth, and their seemingly
ubiquitous heterogeneity. Using microdata from the Brazilian Industrial
Survey from 1996 to 2013, we conducted exercises using panel and cross-
sectional data at different levels of aggregation. Our primary objective is to
see which of the most common stylized facts explored in the evolutionary
economics literature are empirically supported for Brazil. We ﬁnd that,
despite signiﬁcant differences among individual sectors, there is a core set
of regularities that seems to hold for all of them, such as the lognormal-
Pareto distribution of ﬁrm size and the Laplacian distribution of ﬁrm growth
and productivity rates. As such, the evidence for Brazil corroborates the
results found for developed countries. These stylized facts may then describe
ubiquitous processes driving market organization in Economics.

quais dos fatos estilizados mais comuns explorados na literatura de economia
evolucionária tem corroboração empírica para o caso brasileiro. Nossos
resultados mostram que, apesar de diferenças signiﬁcativas entre diferentes
setores, existe um núcleo de regularidades que aparentemente ocorrem para
todos, como o formato lognormal-Pareto das distribuições de tamanho das
ﬁrmas, e o formato Laplaciano das distribuições das taxas de crescimento e
variação da produtividade. Dessa forma, as evidências para o Brasil se alinham
com os resultados encontrados para os países desenvolvidos, e reforçam
a ideia de que esses fatos estilizados descrevem processos universais que
impulsionam a organização dos mercados em Economia.

1 Introduction

There is a rich strand of literature concerning patterns in Industrial Organization that begins with the
works of Pareto (1896) and Gibrat (1931), all the way down to Simon (1955). However, only recently
has there been a systematic effort to compile evidence for several countries outside the US, developed or
not, such as China, India, France, and Italy (Bottazzi and Secchi, 2003, 2005; Bottazzi et al., 2007, 2011;
Mathew, 2017; Yu et al., 2015b). Our work aims to cover the gap concerning the Brazilian manufacturing
sector.

Speciﬁcally, we will ascertain if 1) Brazilian ﬁrms are characterized by the same large skewness and
wide dispersion in most economic metrics as found in other countries; 2) if there is favorable evidence for
the Pareto or lognormal distribution of ﬁrm size; and 3) if there is favorable evidence for the Laplacian
distribution of size and productivity growth rates. By doing this, we ﬁnd a compelling case against some
common hypotheses in economics.

First, there is a wide heterogeneity in ﬁrm behavior for all proxies used, robust under any level of
disaggregation and persistent over time. Such an outcome cast doubts about the existence of an optimal
ﬁrm size or the usefulness of a representative agent as a tool to model the Brazilian economy. Particularly,
our work disavows its usage from an empirical point of view, complementing other works such as Shaikh
(1974), Fisher (2005) and Felipe and McCombie (2013), which took a theoretical approach for their critique.
Since this widespread heterogeneity was found for several countries1, the theoretical economist is on very
unstable grounds when using such tools to model anything minimally resembling the real world.

Second, the general occurrence of a very fat left tail on productivity distributions shows that even if
market selection were an effective promoter of virtuous change on the economy, and most empirical studies
up to this point show that it is not (Bottazzi et al., 2010; Dosi et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015a), its impact is
not enough to avoid the entry and survival of new low-productivity ﬁrms, which makes any convergence for
an efﬁciency frontier a non-occurrence in practical terms. In other words, market selection does not seem
enough to promote productivity growth, and it appears that ﬁrms that are already in activity very seldom
radically change their productive structure.

The lack of empirical validation for competition as broadly understood has consequences on several
grounds, since most of the evolutionary tradition uses selection mechanisms as the basis for their models.
While the very high entry and exit rates indeed point to an underlying choice mechanism by the customer, it
is not clear whether this mechanism is directly related to ﬁrm efﬁciency. Whereas better overall productivity
could be translated into better prices, price by itself, as the innovation literature indicates, may not be the
main factor of a purchase decision, and other factors related to social status, such as brand power and design,
have to be incorporated. These results would diminish the importance of productivity in overall economic
modeling and points to the necessity of searching for proxies of cultural selection.

Third, Brazilian growth distributions have very extreme events, which are closely approximated by a
Laplacian distribution, a curve characterized by its fat tails. As a consequence, growth is not random. While
predicting growth until now has been an impossible task, specially when trying to differentiate high growth
ﬁrms from generic ﬁrms (Coad et al., 2014), the overall distribution of ﬁrm growth rates does not follow
a normal curve, showing that growth itself is not a series of independent events, but has some underlying
correlation instead, even if very complex to be easily described.

Finally, while the idea of technological trajectories may be useful to understand how ﬁrms acquire
capabilities and how new technological paradigms can create instability, the incremental nature of progress
that such theory predicts is not apparent in enterprise surveys.
Instead, productivity growth rates for
Brazil have even fatter tails than size growth rates. The occurrence of such short-term extreme events
highlights that productivity, when measured by monetary terms, is very volatile. Particularly, since there is
an abundance of negative events, the data suggests that monetary productivity may be mostly dominated by
demand, in a sort of micro Kaldor-Verdoorn law.

1See Bartelsman and Doms (2000) for a review.

Since this kind of variation occurs even when we measure it by proxies that seem to be only internal to
the ﬁrm, such as value added, we hypothesize that it must somehow reﬂect changes in capacity utilization2.
The problem is that the lack of correlation between growth and productivity change as evidenced in the
literature shows that this process is not of a simple nature, and is probably related to price and inventory
policies.

In order to show our investigation, our work is divided into three main lines. The ﬁrst gives some
contextual information about the Brazilian Manufacturing and its evolution through the period 1996-2013.
The second line explores the market concentration of Brazilian Firms. We perform aggregated and
disaggregated estimations for size distributions in cross-sectional and annual views. Since Gibrat (1931)
stated the Law of Proportionate Effect, i.e., that ﬁrms’ growth appears to be uncorrelated with their size,
patterns in distributions were found regarding market structure and organization for a broad range of
countries and metrics. There is evidence of skewed distributions for ﬁrm size, closely approximated by
a Pareto or lognormal distribution, at least in the aggregated level (Hart and Prais, 1956; Ijiri and Simon,
1977; Stanley et al., 1995; Axtell, 2001; Cabral and Mata, 2003), which usually extends over a broad
support, implying the coexistence of ﬁrms with signiﬁcant differences in size, spanning several orders of
magnitude.

The third line of investigation deals with dynamics and performance. We perform estimations for
distributions of growth and productivity accompanied by a parametric ﬁt. This exercise is related to a more
recent strand of research regarding the investigation of patterns for distribution of ﬁrm growth, productivity
and productivity variation. Starting with Stanley et al. (1996), followed by Bottazzi and Secchi (2003,
2005); Bottazzi et al. (2007), the Laplacian distribution, a curve characterized by its fat tails, seems to be
well suited to describe the distribution of these metrics for countries as dissimilar as China, India, the United
States and Italy (Yu et al., 2015b; Mathew, 2017). The exponential decay of the Laplacian curve associated
with its fat tails predicts far more frequent extreme events than they would be if short-term events were
completely uncorrelated, such as in a normal distribution.

The rest of this work is divided as follows. The next section presents the data description and some
context on the Brazilian manufacturing sector. The second section overviews the methodology used in this
study. The third section presents the results and a discussion, and the fourth one ends the paper with some
highlights and a conclusion.

2 Data Description

Our analysis is based on the Brazilian Industrial Survey (PIA), which contains yearly census information
for ﬁrms with more than 30 employees and in sectors with CNAE (National Classiﬁcation of Economic
Activities) codes between 5-333. Our total sample comprehends 467,695 observations from 1996 to 2013
and the monetary values were deﬂated using two-digit sectoral prices constructed with the GDP Implicit
Deﬂator from the National Accounts.4 While the number of employees, total revenue and value added are
used as proxies for ﬁrm size, labor productivity is used as a proxy for efﬁciency, given by value added per
employee.

We opted to use labor productivity for several reasons. The ﬁrst is that the data on ﬁrm capital is
unrepresentative of the whole sample due to a large amount of missing data. Labor productivity also

2Unless someone supposes that ﬁrms intentionally destroy their capital, which would somewhat produce a smaller output

given the same input.

3The split in sectors agrees with the ISIC Rev. 4 structure at the two-Digit level, with minimal differences. Most expressively,
alcohol production, which enters ISIC as a chemical product (Sector 20), is classiﬁed by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics’ CNAE 2.0 as a biofuel (Sector 19), due to its extreme importance both as sole fuel and as a mixture with gasoline.

4The access to the data is restricted, and due to privacy reasons we have to exclude any sector with less than three ﬁrms in
any particular exercise. These exclusions make some sectors, such as petroleum extraction, an activity that was a State monopoly
until recently, to appear only in certain views. To avoid errors and ﬁll-in mistakes, we also exclude ﬁrms with negative value
added, negative total revenue, with less than 30 employees or that were registered as inactive.

does not require any intuition about the relationship of the productive structure, nor does it require strong
hypotheses about the substitution between capital and labor.5 Finally, it guarantees comparability between
our study and those of several other scholars (Dosi et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2015b; Mathew, 2017).

Since we are dealing with census information for ﬁrms only above the threshold of 30 employees, most
In 1996, ﬁrms with up to 29
of the Brazilian manufacturing ﬁrms are not captured by our subsample.
employees represented 76% of the number of ﬁrms in manufacturing and mining, or about 82,940 ﬁrms. In
2013, this number increased to 86% of the total, or 296,154 ﬁrms.6 However, according to IBGE (2013),
they have a low share in the number of employees (17% in 1996, 22% in 2013) and value added (6% in
1996, 8% in 2013). Thus, despite the importance that small ﬁrms have on the Brazilian economy and which
our subsample ignores, our database is still responsible, on average, for about 80% of the employment and
90% of the value added in manufacturing and mining (SEBRAE, 2014).

Table 1 shows a summary with statistics for the metrics used in this study considering the full data
sample. The sectors that command the highest productivity are activities related to basic commodities,
such as petroleum extraction and reﬁning (ISICs 6 and 19) and mining (ISICs 7, 8 and 9). These sectors,
along with motor vehicles (ISIC 29), were also the ones that experienced the highest growth in this period.
The worst performer is the tobacco industry (ISIC 12), which suffered from restrictive domestic policies
regarding product design, marketing, and places allowed for consumption. The ranking is followed by
leather (ISIC 15) and textiles (ISIC 13), which were subject to heavy Chinese competition (Soares and
Castilho, 2016).

Note that for the variation metrics we lost almost a hundred thousand observations due to ﬁrms that were
not present in any of the years of the survey. Growth has a positive average rate for all but a few sectors,
and productivity change shows mostly an insigniﬁcant or negative result. Only one sector shows a negative
median growth, while productivity change presents 14 sectors with a weak or negative result. Both metrics
present very fat tails for the majority of sectors.

For the metrics of size, most sectors have indeed signiﬁcant positive skewness and kurtosis, which for
unimodal distributions means that they are fatter on the left side with long tails on the right side.7 We know
that this dispersion comes mostly from large enterprises, and this becomes apparent by the distance between
average and median in several industries. Particularly in metal ores (ISIC 7), the average is almost eight
times the median for the number of workers, 34 times for total revenue and 27 times for value added.

The data shows a signiﬁcant intersectoral heterogeneity, with some sectors having great productivity
but most being much less proliﬁc, which renders a poor overall result for total manufacturing. Our results
are in accordance with other recent studies regarding the structural heterogeneity hypothesis for Brazilian
manufacturing (Catela et al., 2015). These facts provide sound evidence for the ECLAC (Economic Comission
for Latin America) tradition of centre-periphery (Prebisch, 1981; Cimoli and Porcile, 2013). The structural
heterogeneity approach advocated by ECLAC assumes that underdeveloped countries, particularly those
in Latin America, have a hard-cut division between sectors that are well-integrated in international trade
and those that are only competitive in the national market, against a soft decay found for most developed
countries.

Figure 1 shows the changes in shares of value added from 1996 to 2013. Most sectors reduced their
participation to reﬁned petroleum and metal ores. In the same period, these two industries, together with
soybeans, produced the main products exported from Brazil. This decline in the complexity of manufactured
and exported goods from Brazil has been appointed as a cause of low economic dynamism (Hausmann and
Hidalgo, 2014), which is undoubtedly observed due to the reduced total manufacturing growth experienced
in the period, and as a possible symptom of Dutch disease (Gala et al., 2017).

5Issues related to the empirical estimation of these metrics and their relationship with account identities are discussed by

Felipe and McCombie (2013)

6Part of this increase is due to the IBGE starting to consider ﬁrms with less than ﬁve employees in the total.

In fact, several studies have already indicated the failure of economic policies to improve the capacities
of the Brazilian industry (Negri and Cavalcante, 2014) and the low technological intensity demonstrated
in most sectors (Negri and Cavalcante, 2015) is a cause of concern due to their consequence in wealth
concentration and increased gap of income against developed countries (Hartmann et al., 2017).

3 Methodology

Our work presents empirical density distribution estimations with their parametric ﬁtting on proxies for
ﬁrm size, growth and efﬁciency. These exercises permits us to give a broad categorization of the Brazilian
manufacturing industry and the heterogeneity of its performance metrics, while also allowing us to assess
the evidence of more delimited stylized facts, such as the lognormal and Pareto distributions of ﬁrm size
and the Laplacian distribution of ﬁrm productivity, growth and productivity rates.

The analysis is performed in two contexts: a) annual, where all the data sample from each year,

regardless of the sector, is pooled; and b) sectoral, where data from all years are pooled by sector.

Due to space limitations, the visualization of the annual context is limited to three periods (1996, 2004
and 2013) and, in the sectoral context, to three two-digit sectors - mining of metal ores (07), manufacture
of food products (10) and manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers (29). These periods
and sectors were deemed the most representative of the sample, considering differences in technological
intensity, number of ﬁrms and share of value added in total manufacturing.

(cid:19) 1

γ

In relation to empirical kernel distributions, we explore the ones associated to the most important proxies
for performance, size, and growth for Brazilian manufacturing, using the methodology exposed in works
such as Silverman (1986), Tsybakov (2009) and Scott (2015). For all estimations, we use the Epanechnikov
Kernel with bandwidth selected according to Silverman’s rule of thumb (Silverman, 1986, pp. 48). In our
study, we estimated the distributions for any given year or sector that have at least 300 observations. We also
established 512 equally spaced bins for each distribution as a standard. Each density plot is accompanied by
a normal distribution ﬁt to serve as a benchmark. The normal ﬁttings were made using maximum-likelihood
estimation.

Pareto Distributions

For parametric estimations of size distributions we conduct two exercises, one using the Hill estimator

and the other using ordinary least squares (OLS) rank regressions.

Consider that the size distribution follows a cumulative distribution function (CDF) given by:8

F(x) = Prob(S ≤ xi) = 1−

(1)
where Prob(S ≤ x) represents the probability of a random value sampled from the distribution to be smaller
than xi, γ represents the format of the tail, S is a random variable, and xmin represents the smallest observation
considered (i.e., the cut-off point from which the right tail of the distribution is modeled). Also, note that:

xi

Then, making the xi decreasingly ranked, the Hill estimator (Hill, 1975) is deﬁned as:

γ =

1
α

ˆγ =

1
n− 1

n

∑

j=1

ln(x j)− n
n− 1

ln(xmin)

(2)

(3)

where n represents the number of observations used until the cut-off point xmin. Equation (3) includes a
correction for small sample bias and constitutes a Maximum Likelihood estimator, being asymptotically
normal and efﬁcient with smooth distributions.9

Since the Hill estimator can be a poor estimator when the true distribution of the log-CDF is not
linear10 and since the point estimation is very dependent on the chosen cut-off point, we also did a log-
rank regression using the whole distribution and a binned equipopulated empirical distribution for each
plot.

Alternatively, it is possible to write a complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of Equation

(1) as:

R(x) = Prob(S > x) =

(cid:18)xmin

(cid:19)α

xi

(4)

Lower values of the parameter α are associated with more concentrated markets, since it makes the decrease
of probability of ﬁnding ﬁrms up to size xi more steep. This means that there are more smaller ﬁrms but also
that the few largest ﬁrms have most of the market share. Particularly, when α = 1 Equation (4) is reduced
to the so-called Zipf Law, a discrete distribution used to describe various physical and social phenomena
(Newman, 2005). The R(x) distribution can be estimated for a sample by:

ˆR(x) =

j
n

(5)

8We follow the exposition adopted by Bottazzi et al. (2015).
9See (Bottazzi et al., 2015, footnote 6) for a discussion and list of references.
10Basically because of misspeciﬁcation bias due to an incorrect functional form.

where j represents the rank of the ﬁrm decreasingly ordered and n represents the sample size. Equation
(5) is an empirical survival function, or alternatively, a discrete complementary cumulative distribution
function. By taking the log transformation on both sides, we have:

(6)
with αlog(xmin) being the scale factor for the probability function to sum up to unity. In practice, we can
use the ranking j directly, since the number of observations does not affect the value of α, as it is a constant:

log( ˆR(x)) = ˆαlog(xmin)− ˆαlog(x j)

log( j) = αlog(xmin) + log(n)− αlog(x)

(7)

A simple OLS regression can then estimate the parameters in this equation. This procedure is called an

OLS rank regression.
Both methods deliver close point estimations for the true value of the coefﬁcient α for the same xmin
when X ≥ xmin follows a power law (Bottazzi et al., 2015), but the Hill estimator is preferred because of its
properties.

The exercises were conducted for the different contexts expressed at the beginning of this section. We
were unable to use maximum likelihood methods to establish the optimal cut-off point of the Hill estimator
initially, so we set the cut-off point on the 500th observation (Dosi et al., 2008). For the OLS rank regression,
we used all the data in the respective context. Also, following Newman (2005) and Clauset et al. (2009),
instead of reporting the value of |α| for the CCDF, we report the values of |α| + 1, as this gives the decay
value of the probability density function distribution.

Subbotin Fit

For parametric estimations of productivity, growth rates and productivity change distributions we use
asymmetric exponential power (AEP) densities, a class of distributions introduced by Bottazzi et al. (2011)
which belongs to the Subbotin Family of parametric ﬁts (Subbotin, 1923). This distribution is composed
by ﬁve parameters, which present both Laplacian and Gaussian distributions as special cases. Its functional
form is:

where θ (x) and Γ(x) are, respectively, the Heaviside theta and the gamma function, x represents the sample
of the variable for which we want to estimate the parametric ﬁt, m is the sample average, al and ar are the
left and right scale parameters, respectively, and bl and br are the shape parameters.

Speciﬁcally, when b = 1 the ﬁt identiﬁes a Laplacian distribution, and when b = 2 it turns to a normal
distribution. The AEP allows each tail to be determined independently, and the lower the b, the fatter the
tail. The parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, following Bottazzi et al. (2011).

4 Results
Size Distributions

The objective of this section is to search for characteristic patterns in the market structure using different
proxies for size. The existence of a speciﬁc shape may suggest a particular mechanism behind market
organization. When this commonality is shared across countries, it creates favorable signs for the existence
of processes that are of a purely economic nature, trespassing cultural and regional differences.

We begin by exploring the basic shape for the distribution of number of employees, total revenue and
value added. These are the most common metrics for ﬁrm size and are what we commonly deﬁne as the
“market” from the supply side. The distributions of these proxies are so extreme that it is not possible to
have a meaningful visualization of their shapes as they are. Therefore, our plots will present the values from
either the log of the variable or the log-rank version of CCDF.

Figure 2 shows the estimated probability density distributions for the natural logarithm of size proxies.

The dotted line in each plot represents the ﬁt of a normal distribution11 using maximum likelihood estimations.
Results are depicted for total manufacturing in three years of our sample. The shapes present a shift to the
left in all metrics.

The total revenue shows evidence of the emergence of a bimodality, which we suspect to be caused by
the introduction of a new tax regime privileging smaller ﬁrms12. This is the ﬁrst time that we, as authors,
see such a clear-cut effect of policy in the market structure, a fact that we pretend to investigate further.

These patterns, despite the evidence of bimodality, seem to follow the parametric distributions rather
closely, with the worst case occurring when using the number of employees. When we move to a sectoral
view, the apparent goodness of ﬁt of these distributions seems to be improved, particularly for the monetary
proxies, a result that contrasts with the literature. The European and US results tended to show that the
apparent lognormal shape occurred as a consequence of sheer aggregation, exposed for example in Hymer
and Pashigian (1962) for the UK and Bottazzi and Secchi (2003) for the US. While demonstrating the same
fact for the Italian industry, this was the main argument of Bottazzi et al. (2007) to reduce the importance
of the lognormal shape as a stylized fact. Instead, they emphasize a very skewed shape.

It is important to highlight that age was shown to have an essential role in these distributions. Cabral and
Mata (2003) demonstrate that the distributions became less skewed when only old ﬁrms were considered.
So, there is compelling evidence indicating that the entry-exit dynamic is responsible for the highly asymmetrical
shape found in size distributions. Unfortunately, no accurate age-related data of the sample used is available
at this time, so it is not possible to implement the more recent advances regarding Gibrat’s law tests and
age-split density probabilities of ﬁrm size distributions.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of these metrics in a log-rank plot13. In this plot, we compare both
the lognormal (blue) and the Pareto (red) ﬁts for each distribution. These plots show the right tail of the
distribution on the top-left side, with the body and the left tail of the distribution concentrated in the bottom-
right of each graph. The bimodality of the total revenue is not visible anymore.

Both ﬁts seem very close for the data in the annual view. Especially when the number of employees is
considered, the Pareto ﬁt seems favored over the lognormal. Monetary values, on the other hand, display
a more lognormal appearance, particularly in the body. However, it is also important to evaluate the
robustness to disaggregation of these ﬁts. Generally, the quality of the adjustment of sectoral values seems
even better than in the aggregate case, with value added presenting an almost perfect ﬁt of a lognormal
distribution. As in the case with the annual view, the Pareto ﬁt seems favored only for the number of
employees. Different sectors and years also share similar inclinations.

11That means that the original distribution is ﬁtted by a lognormal ﬁt.
12The simples, a special tax regime that was implemented in the Complementary Law No. 123, from December 14th, 2006,
introduces the option for ﬁrms under a speciﬁc constraint of revenue to be taxed by a ﬁxed percentage of their sales. The limits,
around R$ 2-4 million for the period, and the date of the law both coincide with the emergence of the bimodality.

13In this visualization, we plot the previous adaptation on the complementary cumulative distribution function, i.e., we took

the logarithm of the decreasingly ranked ﬁrms and plotted it against the logarithm of the proxy used to measure size.

represent a normal ﬁt for each distribution.

In order to formally present this results, we proceed to report OLS rank and Hill estimations of the
right tail of size distributions. For the Hill estimation, we considered the ﬁve hundred biggest ﬁrms in each
context, whereas we used the whole distribution for the OLS rank regression. The estimations are presented
in Table 2. The OLS rank regression showed great explanatory power of the model, in general over 90%,
which we do not report in detail here. This result should be understood as the model being generally a good
“ﬁt” for the data rather than suggesting the superiority of any particular distribution.

estimation, while the blue line represents the lognormal ﬁt using maximum likelihood estimation.

More interestingly, sectors that present non-smooth formats or bimodalities are still very well represented
by the model. Of all proxies, value added is the one with the “poorest” ﬁt, which, as shown visually in the
previous graphs, reﬂects the apparent superiority of the lognormal ﬁt. A similar result was found by Dosi
et al. (2008), regarding the evidence of a concavity. Yet, more investigation is still necessary to compare
the goodness of ﬁt of different parametric distributions with the use of formal tests (Clauset et al., 2009).

The OLS rank estimation coefﬁcients vary from 1.62 to 2.33 for the number of workers, 2.11 to 3.28
for total revenue and 2.24 to 3.28 for value added. The same metrics using the ML Hill estimator provide
coefﬁcients that range from 1.60 to 3.07, 1.47 to 2.89, and 1.33 to 2.86, respectively.

The estimates obtained by the two methods are close for some sectors, but generally do not agree. This

10

should come as no surprise. As they are both very precise, their differences are caused by disparities in the
cut-off value, with the Hill method being susceptible to the choice of xmin.

In general, our OLS rank estimates for total manufacturing are in accordance with the literature, with
a coefﬁcient of 1.94 when using total employees to measure size, whereas Axtell (2001) found a slope of
2.06 for the US. Our results for total revenue, nevertheless, are less agreeable. While Axtell (2001) found
a slope of 1.99 and Dosi et al. (2008), using Italian and French ﬁrms, a range between 1.8 and 2.05, our
results show coefﬁcients for the OLS rank regression and Hill estimates equal to 2.7 and 2.45, respectively.
Size distributions, therefore, present signiﬁcant right-skewed distributions regardless of the metric used,
which closely resemble lognormal distributions for total revenue and value added and Pareto distributions
(also known as power-law distributions) for the number of employees. This pattern seems robust to both
different disaggregation levels and time frames.

The considerable heterogeneity evidenced by these distributions also corroborates the outcomes of other
works for the Brazilian economy (Nogueira et al., 2014; Esteves, 2015; Squeff and Nogueira, 2015; Catela
et al., 2015). This shows that even controlling by sector at diverse levels of disagreggation, the researcher
still faces a very diverse set of enterprise characteristics.

We hypothesize that the explanation for this last fact may go beyond the usual suspects, such as gains
from different scales of operation and access to better prices through suppliers. In addition to them, market
niches and brand power could create earning differentials that would not be mitigated even if ﬁrms shared
the same costs or technology (Sturgeon, 2002).

Also, the widespread heterogeneity in performance metrics found for other countries (Griliches and
Regev, 1995; Bartelsman and Doms, 2000) indicates that this evidence is not a Brazilian peculiarity.
Neither is it necessarily a problem in itself, although it generally carries along the side effects of wealth
concentration, which is a growing cause of concern and instability in modern societies (Atkinson and
Piketty, 2007).

From all that we know, heterogeneity may very well be a feature of capitalist societies that is still poorly
understood. When the interpretation of the market goes beyond basic price mechanisms (which we explore
better on the section of performance), other hypotheses about customer behavior and market formation start
to make sense.

Hierarchies can constitute a more natural way to transmit signaling information, helping to organize
markets (Krugman, 1996). The idea that markets are intelligent and self-organized goes as back as Hayek
(1945), but the atomized information that the market contains is not necessarily optimal under a set with
uniform agents. Studies from network theory show that networks following power laws are very robust to
random shocks (or, in our case, bankruptcy, for example) since there are few large hubs and many small
components. So, if stability is a required feature for a high-functioning economy (at least, it seems to be
present in most developed countries), it may as well be a required characteristic of any network that is
candidate to describe the connection between customers and enterprises.

That is because customers expect to ﬁnd goods and services available when they search for them, and
if the markets do not have a minimal degree of predictability, they cannot meet their expectations. Market
turnover rates would have to be much lower in a uniform network than in a power-law distributed one for
bankruptcy not to affect a customer. Given the empirical failure rates found in most countries, some kind
of hub-based distribution seems to be our best guess to describe these interactions, since it both prevents
customers from having to spend time creating a wide number of relationships with different ﬁrms (such as
in a uniform distribution) and creating a more predictable environment at the same time; only very rarely
would a customer miss a product that would have been on the shelf some time ago.

Therefore, if size is a good proxy for the number of transactions that a ﬁrm carries, and then, a proxy
for the number of other individuals a ﬁrm is connected to, then this heterogeneity may imply some kind of
power law or a similarly very skewed robust network of producers and consumers.

represents the inclination of the CDF.

Another advantage is that such kind of market organization reduces the distance between agents (Barabasi,

2016). The "small world" effect is much more pronounced in networks that have hubs, which makes the
number of connections needed for any two enterprises to interact to be usually in the single-digit stance.
So, collaborations, at least from the perspective of small businesses, may be more clear. They know who
the key players are, and probably what they are looking for.

At the same time, those networks replicate other aspects of real economies, such as crisis behavior.
Hub-based networks are much more fragile against targeted failures, or meltdowns of important players,
which is usually understood in economics under the concept of “too big to fail” (Nurisso and Prescott,
2017), popularized in the post-2008 crisis after the bailouts of several ﬁnancial and industrial ﬁrms. If those
big ﬁrms are more inclined, by necessity, to trade and lend among themselves, a failure of an important
node starts a contagion mechanism that spreads quickly through the whole network, and forces government
intervention.

Productivity Distributions

We repeat the previous exercise for productivity, which we consider to be the most critical metric of
ﬁtness and performance, and acts as the primary mechanism of survival in evolutionary theories, forming
the “replicator dynamics” of models such as Metcalfe (1994).

Following Dosi et al. (2012); Yu et al. (2015b); Mathew (2017), we proceed to test the parametric
ﬁt of the productivity distributions using the asymmetric exponential power distribution (AEP). The AEP
distribution, introduced by Bottazzi et al. (2011), belongs to a family of distributions started by Subbotin
(1923), which assumes a normal or Laplacian shape accordingly with the values of the b coefﬁcients
used, with values b = 1 generating a Laplacian, and values b = 2 generating a normal distribution. This
distribution estimates the values of b for each tail independently, so bl represents the coefﬁcient for the left
tail, while br represents the right one.

We estimate the ﬁt of these parameters for the natural logarithm of productivity for each sector, which
in turn produces lognormal and log-Laplacian ﬁts. We used a maximum likelihood method, but we were
unable to achieve convergence for all sectors. The results are detailed in Table 3.

Somewhat more intensively than expected, the AEP estimation reveals tails signiﬁcantly fatter on the
left side (notably for the food sector). They are even fatter than what a log-Laplacian distribution would
produce, and the estimates are smaller than the ones found for China and Italy (Yu et al., 2015b; Dosi
et al., 2012). Following the international results, the right side presents a steeper decline, very close to a
lognormal distribution, with few exceptions.

Figure 4 shows the distributions of (log) productivity with the parametric ﬁts of (log) normal and (log)
AEP ﬁts. The AEP ﬁts seem rather good and superior to the one produced by a (log) normal. They also
seem very robust to different periods and sectors.

The overall picture provides supporting evidence from what Dosi et al. (2012) called an “efﬁciency
frontier”. Firms that are at the top of productivity in their sectors face constraints that are technological in
their nature, which in turn create barriers for increases in productivity that are similar for all leaders, with far
fewer outliers. Firms are more widely dispersed at the “bottom” of productivity, since their survival may be
more attached to spatial or contextual advantages. Alternatively, their low productivity may reﬂect not low
physical productivity per se, but a low capacity to capture market earnings and their adverse positioning
in their production network (Sturgeon, 2002; Gerefﬁ et al., 2005) - particularly if they are producing for
intermediate consumption, which may see them subjugated by the monopsonistic power of the leading
ﬁrms.

Rate Distributions

In this section, we analyze the nature of the distributions of ﬁrm growth and productivity change rates.
These variables are fundamental to understand the economic process as they are the power that shapes the
markets. In fact, there is no capitalism without dynamics. To understand them, thus, is to understand how
markets and consumers interact to decide who will be chosen to produce and what will keep being produced.
It is remarkably intriguing that this process would ever assume any particular shape. There is no apparent
reason why dynamics should have to follow a speciﬁc mechanism or be modeled by simple stochastic
principles. However, as imaginative as nature is, such patterns do exist and have now been found for several
countries.

The results for the AEP estimates are presented in Table 4. They show that distributions on growth rates
and productivity change are fairly symmetrical for most sectors, with all the b estimates close to one or
below, indicating tails that are at least Laplacian. Growth rates present values that are comparable with the
ones from India (Mathew, 2017) and lower than the ones found for Italy and the US (Bottazzi and Secchi,
2003; Bottazzi et al., 2007), while productivity change presents values lower than those found for China
(Yu et al., 2015b).

Figure 5 presents the distribution of growth rates and productivity change for three years (notice the log-
transformation in the vertical axis), together with both AEP and normal ﬁts. The graph for each period and
proxy shows a very clear, "tent-like" shape. Also, note the poor ﬁt of the normal distribution to describe the
tails. The normal ﬁt falls much faster than the empirical rates, which demonstrates that infrequent events
of extreme impact are much more “common” than it would be expected under normality. The bottom
side shows the same plot for three different sectors. A similar tent-like shape as before is found, proving
this pattern to be robust under disaggregation. Speciﬁcally, productivity change for the food sector (ISIC
10) presents some symmetrical inﬂections at both ends of the distribution that deserve more investigation.
Overall, the tent-like shape is very solid and characterizes a Laplacian curve.

Bottazzi and Secchi (2006) explored this phenomenon in detail in a model following Simon’s tradition
of “islands of opportunity”(Ijiri and Simon, 1977). If we suppose that there is a limited availability of
growth episodes available for ﬁrms and that the ones that have taken these opportunities in the past have
more chance of winning them in the future, thus generating a path-dependent mechanism of competition,
then the model can reproduce this Laplacian shape asymptotically.

At the same time, these distributions offer an interesting contrast with some notions from innovation
theory. First, the notion of capabilities, which are incremental in the sense that they are hard to obtain
and must be accumulated and built upon, thus constituting the core of value generated by ﬁrms (Penrose,
1959; Malerba, 1992; Teece et al., 1997; Gerefﬁ et al., 2005), with learning by doing being a primary
factor (Arrow, 1962). Second, the idea of technological trajectories, which are mostly subject to periods
of incremental improvement with discontinuities following structural breaks due to radical or disruptive
innovation (Dosi, 1982; Dosi and Nelson, 2010). These two concepts, together, would make one expect
fairly smooth periods of incremental perfecting followed by large leaps of rapid growth due to paradigm
changes.

Instead, the shape of growth or productivity change rate distributions is continuously bombarded by
a process that generates extreme, symmetrical events. It sounds implausible that in all these cases some
disruptive innovation is happening for a few, and not necessarily the same, enterprises all the time, notably
for sectors that are already mature or stagnate. Stochastic and simpler models as the ones proposed by
Bottazzi and Secchi (2006) seem closer to the empirical data.

This, of course, does not disavow any theory of incremental innovation or continuous improvement, but
suggests that there are essential middle steps between what conﬁgures learning in the sense of technological
advancement and organizational management and what in fact generates ﬁnancial returns, the latter being
somewhat more extreme in its deviation and, at the same time, relatively constant in its nature. Increases in
physical productivity do not necessarily translate into increased monetary productivity, and quality change
does not imply sales growth. Especially with highly standardized products, a lot of these gains became
customer surplus, e.g., transistors and steel production (Dosi and Nelson, 2010).

Thus, while we are obviously not disagreeing with the idea that physical productivity and technology
change play an important role in monetary growth and monetary productivity change, these theories must
be adapted to faithfully incorporate the kind of short-term competition and the network nature of markets,
such as to deﬁne who is more probably to take the gains of innovation: consumers, leaders or innovators.
(Gerefﬁ et al., 2005).

5 Conclusion

This article presented a list of statistical measures regarding Brazilian manufacturing. Our results
corroborate the international literature and weight favorably to the hypothesis that stylized facts on growth,
productivity and size may describe timeless economic phenomena.

Among them, our highlights are 1) the ubiquitous heterogeneity found in the most signiﬁcant economic
proxies for size, performance, and growth; 2) the skewness of ﬁrm size distributions, well described by
lognormal and Pareto distributions; 3) the efﬁciency frontier and the roles that hierarchies may play in
productivity distributions, and ﬁnally 4) the Laplacian shape of ﬁrm growth rates and productivity change,
implying some type of short-term correlation and competition across business opportunities.

Our interpretation of these results is that they move us to a more complex representation of the markets
than what is usually thought. At the same time, the periodicity and robustness of these stylized facts put the
theorist in a much ﬁrmer ground. We feel that this kind of characterization of empirical results in stylized
facts helps more to advance the ﬁeld than oblivious testing of a priori hypotheses. In this sense, we follow
the spirit of the words of Gabaix (2009, p. 285), “Estimate, don’t test!” and Tukey (1962, p. 13),“it is
better to have an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to
the wrong question, which can always be made precise”. So, what are the consequences of these results for
the economics profession?

We think that the current stream of empirical evidence regarding both industrial organization, behavioral
economics, labor markets and the most useful tools developed by the great empiricists of the 20th century,
such as Wassily Leontief, Colin Clark and Simon Kuznets, known formally as the National Accounts, needs
a deep integration with models that can adequately reproduce what is empirically found while having depth
in economic thought. The class of models broadly named as “Schumpeter meets Keynes” (Dosi et al.,
2010) is a valid effort in this direction, but one that is only in its infancy. The network nature of economics
must be recognized, and we need to develop a more realistic representation of the intermediate expenditure,
e.g., drawing in the literature of complexity (Hausmann and Hidalgo, 2014; Hartmann et al., 2017), such as
input-output tables at the ﬁrm level, which will enable to enrich representations as the ones developed by
Gerefﬁ et al. (2005).

The overall prognostic is optimistic, and while our knowledge of economics will probably always be
only of a statistical nature, the lack of data and computational power that affected the previous generations
are no longer a problem, and now we have the opportunity to bring the economic ﬁeld to more solid grounds.
