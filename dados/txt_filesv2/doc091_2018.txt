Abstract: The general objective of this paper was to analyze the relationship between product 
quality and Brazilian agricultural exports. In addition,  it set out to identify the effects of the 
exporters’  income  and  distance,  and  the  SPS  and  TBT  measures  on  the  quality  of  exported 
products. Brazilian agricultural export data (HS 4-digit) for the main trading partners  during 
the 1997-2016 period were used. The results obtained from analyses in relation to trade with 
new markets included the identification of negative effects of quality on both the probability of 
accessing new markets and the share of trade transactions involved. For the intensive margin, 
the value exported to existing partners, the estimated coefficients showed that the increase in 
quality  is  associated  with  greater  quantity  exported.  In  addition,  this  research  showed  that 
quality  was  positively affected by income and distance, and  that the income effect  grows as 
different levels of quality are considered. Finally, the issuance of SPS and TBT measures by 
Brazilian importers also led to an improvement in the quality of Brazilian agricultural exports.

Resumo: O objetivo geral deste trabalho foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade dos produtos 
e as exportações agrícolas brasileiras. Além  disso, buscou identificar os efeitos da renda,  da 
distância  dos  exportadores  e  das  medidas  SPS  e  TBT  sobre  a  qualidade  dos  produtos 
exportados. Foram utilizados dados das exportações agrícolas brasileira (HS 4 dígitos) para os 
principais parceiros comerciais no período de 1997 a 2016. Os resultados obtidos da análise em 
relação  ao  comércio  com  novos  mercados,  incluíram  a  identificação  de  efeito  negativo  da 
qualidade tanto na probabilidade de acesso a novos mercados quanto na parcela de comércio 
transacionado.  Para  a  margem  intensiva,  o  valor  exportado  para  os  parceiros  existentes,  os 
coeficientes  estimados  mostraram  que  o  aumento  da  qualidade  está  associado  à  maior 
quantidade  exportada.  Além  disso,  esta  pesquisa  mostrou  que  a  qualidade  foi  afetada 
positivamente pela renda e pela distância, e que o efeito renda cresce à medida que diferentes 
níveis  de  qualidade  são  considerados.  Finalmente,  a  emissão  de  medidas  SPS  e  TBT  pelos 
importadores brasileiros também levou a uma melhoria na qualidade das exportações agrícolas 
brasileiras.

1.  Introduction 

Recent research points to the relevance of the quality of exported products as a determinant 
of comparative advantage and the international standard of competition, or in other words, how 
differences in quality affect the way in which the products of countries compete with each other 
(BASTOS;  SILVA,  2010;  BRAMBILLA,  PORTO,  2016;  FLACH,  2016;  KHANDELWAL, 
2010). The main results show that higher quality products are shipped to more distant trading 
partners and to countries with higher income levels. 

When  dealing  with  the  quality  of  exported  products  and  comparative  advantage,  Alcalá 
(2008, 2016) emphasizes that companies in a country with comparative advantage in a given 
sector tend to be more productive in world terms and, as a consequence, are able to produce 
better  quality  goods.  Jaimovich  and  Merella  (2015)  argued  that  a  country’s  comparative 
advantage  is  strengthened  by  improving  product  quality.  They  found  that  comparative 
advantage  and  quality  contributed  positively  to  the  penetration  of  imports  from  a  group  of 
countries, and that this effect was relatively higher for importers with higher income levels.  

Countries have different perceptions of quality, and in general, more developed and higher 
income  economies  tend  to  value  higher  quality  products  more  than  others.  Consequently, 
countries seeking to  successfully  enter such markets  should constantly  strive to  improve the 
quality  of  their  exports  in  order  to  meet  more  demanding  requirements  (BRAMBILLA, 
PORTO, 2016).  

To achieve higher levels of quality, changes in production processes and the use of an ever 
more  skilled  labor  force  are  required,  which  in  turn,  demand  higher  wages.  However,  such 
changes are often costly and not always achievable in less developed countries. As suggested 
by  Falvey  (1981)  and  Falvey  and  Kierzkowski  (1987),  differences  in  countries’  factor 
endowments could be one of the determinants of product quality differences. Hence, countries 
which  are  capital-abundant  specialize  in  the  production  of  higher  quality  goods,  while  less 
developed nations (labor-abundant) specialize in lower quality goods. 

According to Leamer (2006), improvements in the quality of goods would have implications 
for trade, wages and the level of output of an economy. Therefore, the exportation of higher 
quality products is a major issue, especially for nations more dependent on international trade. 
In Brazil, the performance of the external sector, especially agricultural exports, exerts a 
great influence on the economic aggregates. According to 2017 data from the MIDC (Ministério 
do Desenvolvimento, Indústria e Comércio Exterior - Ministry of Development, Industry and 
Foreign Trade), agricultural exports in recent years accounted for 40% of Brazil's total exports, 
thereby making a major  contribution  to  a more favorable balance of trade. Therefore,  an in-
depth analysis of the export quality of agricultural products contributes to a better understanding 
of this crucially important sector of the Brazilian economy. 

With  that  in  mind,  the  general  objective  of  this  paper  was  to  analyze  the  relationship 
between the quality of products and Brazilian agricultural exports. More specifically, it sets out 
to analyze the effect of export quality on access to new markets, on the share exported to the 
new market in relation to total volume exported and on the total value of exports to existing 
partners. In addition, the study seeks to identify the effects of exporters’ income and distance, 
and SPS and TBT measures on the quality of products exported. 

An analysis of the Brazilian export market from the point of view of quality of products 
exported  is  relevant  as,  trading  higher  quality  products  is  a  necessary  condition  for  the 
successful  inclusion  of  such  goods  in  importing  countries  (Khandelwal,  2010).  Given  that 
quality  depends  on  the  perception  of  these  importers  and  considering  that  more  advanced 
countries tend to consume higher quality products, a more detailed analysis of the implications 
of  quality  for  the  dynamics  of  international  trade  is  crucial.  These  questions  are  even  more

critical in developing countries, as they do not always have a strong credit market, a quality 
institutional  environment,  investments  in  technology  or  other  conditions  which  facilitate  the 
production and export of higher quality goods. 

Differently  from  other  papers  on  this  theme  (BASTOS;  SILVA,  2016;  FLACH,  2016; 
BRAMBILLA; PORTO, 2016)1, the present research focuses on the agricultural sector. In the 
case of Brazil, an analysis of export quality is even more appropriate given the emphasis placed 
by the external sector on the generation of foreign exchange, especially in agriculture, which 
has  been  responsible  for  a  favorable  balance  of  trade  in  recent  years.  In  addition,  Brazilian 
farming  has  always  played  a  leading  role  in  economic  growth  and  in  the  generation  of 
employment and income. This paper makes the added contribution of separately considering 
the effect that the quality of exports can have on entry into new markets as well as on existing 
markets.  

It is noteworthy in terms of advances in relation to the literature that the second part of this 
paper  investigates  the  influence  of  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  (SPS)  and  technical  (TBT)2 
measures on product quality. Various studies on international trade address the effect of these 
measures on the trade flow of countries, and ambiguous results have been found depending on 
their restrictive nature3. However, in addition to the standard analysis of these notifications, this 
paper  presents  another  hypothesis,  namely,  that  when  a  country  imposes  SPS  and/or  TBT 
measures and the exporter is capable of adapting to the requirements, then the result could be 
the exportation of higher quality products. This research also contributes with its analysis which 
considers different levels of quality of agricultural exports. It is, thus, possible to carry out a 
more detailed study of the effect of certain explanatory variables on different quality ranges, 
through an analysis of different quantiles. 

A greater understanding  of the effects  of quality  of agricultural  exports on Brazil's trade 
relations can help in drafting and improving policies applied to the sector, so that the country 
can maintain and increase the value of its exports and intensify the dynamism of its sales to the 
foreign market. 

This study is divided into five sections, in addition to this Introduction. The second section 
presents a brief Literature Review on the topic in question. The third presents the Methodology 
used, while section 4 presents the Data. Section 5 covers the presentation and discussion of the 
Results, and finally, the sixth section presents the Final Comments. 
 

2.  Literature Review 
 
Bastos and Silva (2010) analyzed the factors influencing the export quality of Portuguese 
firms, while considering different product categories and destination markets for the year 2005. 
They used panel data for 16,541 exporting firms, 7,591 product categories exported and 220 
trading partners. The results indicated that FOB (proxy for export quality) unit values increased 
with distance and tended to be higher when trade was carried out with wealthier countries. It 
was  also  seen  that  the  productivity  of  the  company  extended  the  positive  effect  of  distance, 
which  suggests  that  companies  of  high  productivity  and  top  quality  were  able  to  serve 

                                                           
1 These and other papers are presented in more detail in section 2. 
2 According to World Trade Organization (WTO, 2017), the SPS agreement aims to prevent justified measures for 
the protection of human, animal and plant health from being barriers to trade, while the TBT agreement seeks to 
prevent  technical  measures  such  as  standards,  regulations  for  production,  labeling  and  conformity  assessment 
procedures from acting in the same manner (FREITAS, et al., 2015). 
3  The  positive  consequences  of  imposing  SPS  and  TBT  measures  involve  increasing  product  quality,  human, 
animal and plant safety, and the harmonization of international regulations and standards. These advantages are 
gained  when the cost  of adaptation to such requirements is  reasonable and is compensated by  the  greater  flow 
marketed. On the other hand, measures can be interpreted as barriers to trade if the adjustment generates significant 
costs in the production process and commercialization of the product.

potentially more difficult commercial partners. Brambilla and Porto (2016), when dealing with 
income levels of destination countries, and quality of exports and wages, set out to investigate 
whether  industries  exporting  products  to  high-income  trading  partners  paid  higher  average 
wages. They used panel data for 82 countries from 1990 to 2000 and estimated an instrumental 
variable  model.  The  results  showed  that  industries  which  export  products  to  higher  income 
markets tend to trade higher quality products. This means that richer countries demand higher 
quality products. The study also indicated that the production of quality products is costly and 
requires more intensive use of skilled labor with higher wages. Thus, higher quality products 
tend to create higher wages. 

Flach  (2016)  using  1997-2000  data  on  Brazilian  exporting  firms,  set  out  to  check  if 
companies segment the markets and if the characteristics of the destination country affected the 
quality  and  price  of  the  product.  The  main  results  indicated  market  segmentation  based  on 
quality, in which firms increased quality and prices to the high-income partners. Robustness 
analyses have confirmed the hypothesis that price differences in all export destinations can be 
driven by investments in product quality and high-quality demand. 

Fan, Li and Yeaple (2015) analyzed the effect of tariff reduction on the quality of goods 
exported by Chinese firms from 2001 to 2006. The results suggested that a reduction in import 
tariffs,  which  could  facilitate  access  to  intermediate  inputs,  tends  to  induce  producers  to 
improve the quality of products and increase their prices in foreign markets. 

Verhoogen  (2008)  proposed  a  new  approach  linking  trade  and  wage  inequality  in 
developing countries through the quality improvement mechanism and analyzed its empirical 
implications for manufacturing firms in Mexico. The results indicated that the most productive 
firms produce higher quality goods and pay higher wages. Only the most productive firms are 
capable of entering the export market and tend to produce higher quality goods for the external 
than for the domestic market. In addition, it was found that a devaluation of the exchange rate 
led the more productive firms to increase exports, improve the quality of their products and pay 
higher wages when compared to the less productive firms within the same industry. Evidence 
indicated that quality improvement, induced by a currency shock (the 1994 Mexican peso crisis) 
increased wage inequality. 

Filho,  Medeiros  and  Albuquerquemello  (2017)  analyzed  the  quality  of  Brazilian  exports 
between  1997  and  2014,  at  interstate  and  sectorial  levels  and  according  to  the  degree  of 
technological  content.  They  considered  Brazilian  processing  industry  exports  to  193 
commercial  partners.  In  the  aggregate  analysis,  it  was  found  that  the  quality  of  products 
exported by the country was practically constant over time. In the disaggregated analysis, they 
found that for the technology-intensive sectors (medium and high technological intensity), in 
17 of the 27 units of the federation and in 17 of the 23 classes of product considered, there was 
an  improvement  in  the  quality  of  exported  goods.  They  also  found  evidence  that  wealthier 
Brazilian states exported higher quality products. 

Hallack (2006) conducted an empirical analysis to see if product quality plays a relevant 
role in determining trade patterns. He used 1,995 data on bilateral flows at sectoral level for 60 
countries. Overall, the results confirmed the theoretical prediction that higher income countries 
import more from trading partners producing higher quality goods. Manova and Zhang (2012) 
analyzed Chinese exporting firms from 2003 to 2005, considering a total of 243 trading partners 
and 7,526 products. It was seen that the most successful exporters used higher quality inputs to 
produce higher quality goods. In addition, firms varied the quality of their products in all target 
markets, using inputs of different quality levels. 

Anwar  and  Sun  (2018)  analyzed  the  relationship  between  foreign  direct  investment  and 
improvement  in  the  quality  of  exports  from  the  Chinese  manufacturing  sector  from  2005  to 
2007.  The  results  indicated  that  the  greater  presence  of  foreign  firms  in  the  sector  analyzed 
contributed to an increase in the quality of Chinese exports. It was also found that the inclusion 

 

4 

of firms from the Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions led to an even greater increase in the 
quality of products exported by China. 

 
 
3.  Methodology 

 

3.1.Export Quality 
 
The quality indicator of the exported products used in this study was based on the approach 
of  Khandelwal  (2010)  and  Kandelwal,  Schott  and  Wei  (2013).  The  model  specified  by  the 
authors  supposes  a  utility  function  of  the  CES  type  considering  that  the  preferences  of  the 
consumers incorporate quality (𝛿): 
𝑈 =   ∫
                                                            

                                                                                               (1)    

[𝛿(𝑔)𝑞(𝑔)]𝜎−1

𝑔 ∈𝐺

𝜎⁄

By  maximizing  the  utility  function  (1)  subject  to  budget  constraint,  we  arrive  at  the 

following demand equation: 
𝑈 = (𝛿𝑘𝑗
 

𝜎−1)(𝑝𝑘𝑗)𝑃𝑘𝑗

𝜎−1𝑌𝑗                                                                                        (2) 

Applying the logarithm in (2), the quality for each observation related to the sectors which 

constitute Brazilian agriculture, can be obtained as the residue of the expression: 
𝑙𝑛𝑞𝑘𝑗 + 𝜎 ∗ 𝑙𝑛𝑝𝑘𝑗 =   𝛼𝑗 + 𝛼𝑘 + 𝜀𝑘𝑗                                                                                    (3)   
where 𝑞𝑘𝑗 refers to the quantity exported (kg) in each sector for j-th country, 𝑝𝑘𝑗 is the exported 
value of agricultural products and 𝜎  is the elasticity of substitution. 𝛼𝑗 and 𝛼𝑘  represent the 
fixed  effects  of  importing  country  and  sector4,  respectively.  Equation  (3)  was  estimated  by 
Ordinary Least Squares, after assuming a given value for σ. As in the case of the study by Filho, 
Medeiros  and  Albuquerquemello  (2017),  the  median  elasticity  of  substitution  estimated  by 
Broda, Greenfield and Weinstein (2006) for each country was also used in this study. 

The quality of agricultural products exported by Brazil to each sector in j-th country (𝛿𝑘𝑗) 
can be obtained by dividing the residue obtained in (3) by the elasticity of substitution minus 
one: 
𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 =    𝜎̂ ≡    𝜀̂𝑘𝑗 𝜎 − 1

                                                                                                                      (4) 

⁄

 
Thus, the measure of the quality of Brazilian exports of agricultural products obtained in 

(4) was incorporated into the estimated equations of the model. 
 

3.2. Empirical specification  

                                                           
4  The  sectors  considered  in  this  study  refer  to  the  agricultural  product  groups  for  the  2-digit  codes  of  the

and other aquatic invertebrates; 04 - Dairy produce; birds' eggs; natural honey; edible products of animal origin, 
not elsewhere specified or included; 05 - Products of animal origin, not elsewhere specified or included; 06 - Live

In order to meet the different objectives proposed in this study, after obtaining the export 

quality indicator, it was possible to estimate the following empirical models: 

 

𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 =   𝛽0 +   𝛽1 ln(qual.𝑖𝑗𝑘 ) +   𝛽2 ln(GDP𝑖𝑡) + 𝛽3 ln(GDP𝑗𝑡) + 𝛽4 ln(𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡.𝑖𝑗 ) +
 𝛽5 ln(cont.𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝛽6(𝑇𝐵𝑇𝑗𝑘𝑡) +   𝛽7(𝑆𝑃𝑆𝑗𝑘𝑡) +   𝛼𝑡 +   𝜇𝑘 + 𝛾𝑗 +   𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡                                (5)  
 

The dependent variables were defined as: (i) New Market: dummy variable which receives 
a value of 1 if a particular commercial transaction between Brazil and the j-th country occurred 
after three consecutive  years without negotiations between such  countries, and 0 otherwise5; 
(ii) Share: share of the volume marketed by country i (Brazil) of product k with the new market 
j of the total volume traded (US$), in year t; (iii) value of exports from country i of product  k 
to j-th country, with which Brazil already trades (already existing market), in year t - intensive 
trade margin measure, where j represents the 97 main Brazilian trading partners of agricultural 
products over the 1997-2016 period; k corresponds to all HS 4-digit products from the 22 HS 
2-digit sectors, representing the agricultural products considered in the sample. It is important 
to  highlight  that  the  export  data  (US$  and  Kg)  refer  to  the  8-digit  Mercosur  Common 
Nomenclature (NCM) products, with the first six digits of that nomenclature corresponding to 
the first six digits of the HS. 

qual.ijk refers to the quality indicator of exports from country i (Brazil) to the j-th country in 
sector k, according to section 3.1; GDP𝑖𝑡 and GDP𝑗𝑡 are the respective GDPs of country i and j 
in  year  t  (nominal  GDP  –  US$),  used  to  indicate  the  income  of  Brazil  and  the  importing 
countries; dist.ij indicates the distance between country i and country j, measured by the distance 
(km)  between  the  most  populous  city  of  each  country.  As  these  cities  represent  a  greater 
participation  in  the  economic  and  export  activity  of  the  country,  studies  use  this  proxy  to 
measure  the  distance  between  the  countries  (BASTOS,  SILVA,  2010,  BITTENCOURT, 
MATTOS,  LIMA,  2016);  contig.ij is  a  dummy  which  assumes  1  if  country  j  is  bordered  by 
Brazil,  and  0  otherwise;  TBTjkt  and  SPSjkt  are  the  notifications  related  to  the  TBT  and  SPS 
agreements issued by Brazil's main trading partners of agricultural products in the year t; 𝛼𝑡, 
𝜇𝑘 and 𝛾𝑗 refer to the fixed effects of time, product and importing country, respectively. Finally, 
𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 is the error term.  

To estimate the first dependent variable (i), despite its dichotomous nature, the Ordinary 
Least  Squares  (OLS)  method  was  used,  instead  of  non-linear  probability  models  (probit  or 
logit).  This  choice  was  made  because  including  a  significant  number  of  fixed  effects  can 
generate the problem of the incidental parameter (BEENSTLOCK; FELSENSTEIN, 2007). For 
the estimations considering the variables specified in (ii) and (iii), the OLS and Pseudo Poisson-
Maximum-Likelihood  (PPML)  methods  were  used  in  the  context  of  gravitational  equations. 
The  presence  of  null  flows  in  the  dependent  variables  of  the  respective  models  and  the 
heterogeneity of trade patterns can lead to biased estimates when obtained by Ordinary Least 
Squares.  Thus,  the  PPML  method  was  used  to  deal  with  these  limitations,  and  to  obtain 
consistent  estimates  (SANTOS  SILVA;  TENREYRO,  2006).  However,  both  methods  were 
estimated to test robustness. 

The second group of estimated models, based on equation (6), aims to analyze the effect of 
the variables exporter income, distance between countries and the imposition of SPS and TBT 
measures on the quality of agricultural products exported by Brazil, and can be expressed as 
follows: 
 

                                                           
5  Situations  in  which  Brazil  did  not  trade  with  the  importing  country  in  an  interval  of  1  or  2  years  were  not 
considered as a new market, as very short periods may not be considered as a total exit of Brazil from that market.

ln (𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖.𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 ) =   𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ln(GDP𝑖𝑡) + 𝛽2 ln(𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡.𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝛽3(𝑇𝐵𝑇𝑗𝑘𝑡) +   𝛽4(𝑆𝑃𝑆𝑗𝑘𝑡) +   𝛼𝑡 +
 𝜇𝑘 + 𝛾𝑗 +   𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡                                                                                                     (6) 
 

The  dependent  variable  and  the  independent  variables  of  model  (6)  were  defined  and 
explained as previously presented in the specification of equation (5). To obtain the estimates 
of this model, the OLS method was used with the inclusion of fixed effects of time, product and 
importing country. 

With a view to identifying if there are differences in the effects of the variables considered 
(GDP,  Distance,  SPS  and  TBT  notifications)  on  different  points  of  the  quality  distribution, 
model (6) was also estimated using the unconditional quantile regression method, proposed by 
Firpo et al. (2009). This approach uses the concept of Recentered Influence Function which, 
according  to  Silva  and  França  (2016),  allows  for  the  identification  of  the  relative  effect 
(influence) of an individual observation on certain statistics of interest. That is, for a distribution 

statistic 

, the influence of each observation on 

 is given by the influence function 

. By adding the statistic back into the influence function, the result is the so-called 

Recentered Influence Function – RIF, specified as 
. In the present 
research,  the  analyzed  statistic  refers  to  the  quantum  of  the  distribution  of  the  quality  of 
Brazilian exports (𝑄𝜏).  

Considering  the  presence  of  a  covariate  vector  X,  it  is  assumed  that  the  conditional 
, and 

expectation of the RIF can be modulated as a function of X, i.e., 

can be presented as a linear regression as a function of X, i.e.,

. Thus, 

given the hypothesis 
unconditional quantile regression can be specified as: 

 and applying the Law of Iterated Expectations, the estimated 

𝑅𝐼𝐹(𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖.𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑡 ; 𝑄𝜏) =   𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ln(GDP𝑖𝑡) + 𝛽2 ln(𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡.𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝛽3(𝑇𝐵𝑇𝑗𝑘𝑡) +

The problem of the endogeneity of the variables is constantly pointed out in the literature 
on international trade (SILVA et al., 2016; FONTAGNÉ et al., 2015; FLACH, 2016; BASTOS; 
SILVA,  2010).  Thus,  it  is  crucial  to  recognize  that  the  explanatory  variables  related  to  the 
quality of exports, GDP and SPS and TBT measures could be potentially endogenous, due to 
their simultaneity with the dependent variable. The use of instrumental variables would be the 
appropriate procedure to correct such endogeneity. However, as suitable instruments are hard 
to find, it should be considered that the results found in this research could contain this possible 
bias of endogeneity. 

 
4.  Data 
 
The data used in this research are annual, covering the 1997-2016 period. 
Exports: information on the value of Brazilian exports (US$) and quantity exported (kg) 
were  collected  from  SECEX/MDIC (Secretariat  of Foreign Trade  – Secretaria do Comércio 
Exterior  /  Ministry  of  Development,  Industry  and  Foreign  Trade  –  Ministério  do 
Desenvolvimento, Indústria e Comércio Exterior, 2017). In this database the classification of 
products  follows  the  Mercosur  Common  Nomenclature  (NCM),  with  its  first  digits 
corresponding to the first digits of the Harmonized System (HS), allowing for the use of SECEX 
data. 

Gross Domestic Product (GDP): the indicative variable of income in Brazil (exporter) and 
the main trading partners was obtained from the World Bank (World Development Indicators, 
2017).

populous city of the selected importing countries in  the sample and São Paulo  (measured in 
Km)  and  the  existence  of  a  common  border  between  Brazil  and  the  partners,  were  obtained 
from the Centre D’Estudes Prospective et d’Informations Internationales (CEPII, 2017). 

SPS and TBT: notifications to the SPS and TBT measures issued by Brazilian importers, 
with  regard  to  agricultural  products  from  the  2-digit  HS,  were  taken  from  the  2017  WTO 
Documents online page. 

5.  Results 

 

This section presents and discusses the results of this study. First, there is a brief description 
of the data and an analysis of the quality indicator of the agricultural sector exports for each 2-
digit HS code considered, during the 1997-2016 period. Then, the estimates of the quality effect 
on Brazilian commercial relations are presented.

Before presenting the results of the estimates made in the research, a descriptive analysis of 
the data is done (initially) to identify certain characteristics of the sample selected. According 
to  Table  1,  the  average  value  exported  by  Brazil’s  agricultural  sector  to  the  main  trading 
partners between 1997 and 2016 was approximately US$200,000, while the average exported 
volume was 378 tons.

The  average  of  the  representative  variable  of  Brazil's  income  (GDPi)  in  the  period 
considered was US$ 1.45 trillion. For commercial partners, the average value of GDP was US$ 
1.41 trillion. In addition, 23% of the trade transactions between Brazil and the main destination 
markets  for  agricultural  exports  in  the  1997-2016  period  occurred  with  countries  sharing  a 
common border. The average distance between the most populous Brazilian city and those of 
the other partners was 7,917 Km. 

As regards the variables representative of the non-tariff measures used in the present study, 
it was seen that only 1.7% of exports received some technical notification (TBT). For sanitary 
and  phytosanitary  notifications  (SPS),  about  10%  of  commercial  relations  occur  under  the 
issuance  of  such  measures.  It  is  also  worth  noting  that  21.6%  of  transactions  involve  a  new 
market, that is, exports were made to partners who did not import the Brazilian product three 
years previously.

The  indicator  referring  to  the  quality  of  exported  agricultural  products  (Quality),  as 
specified in section 3.1., presented an average value of 5.2, while the maximum value (14.91) 
was seen for exports of "live animals and other animal products" (HS 01). The lowest value of 
the  indicator  was  found  for  "cereals"  (HS  10),  whose  exports  are  usually  characterized  by 
products with lower added value. 

Figure 1 shows the mean quality per sector considered in the study (HS 02) for the 1997 - 
2016 period, to analyze the evolution of the indicator over this period. In general, there were 
no  substantial  changes  in  the  quality  of  agricultural  exports.  For  most  sectors,  the  indicator 
increased, especially that of exports of "live animals and other animal products" (HS 01), where 
average quality increased from 6.4 to 7.8, and that of exports of "fish and crustaceans, molluscs 
and other aquatic invertebrates" (HS 03), where average quality increased from 5.7 to 6.7. This 
increase in quality was expected given the perishability of these products. They require greater 
investment in quality to ensure that they arrive at their destination in adequate conditions for 
consumption. On the other hand, the sectors "preparations of meat, fish or crustaceans, molluscs 
or other aquatic invertebrates" (HS 16), "tobacco" (HS 24) and "cotton" (HS 52) presented a 
slight reduction in average export quality.

Figure 2 shows the relationship between average quality of products and the total amount 
exported to Brazil's main trading partners over the 1997-2016 period. This figure shows that 
countries with consolidated markets, such as China and the United States, imported products 
with  above  average  quality  (Table  1),  as  expected.  However,  on  average,  higher  quality 
products have also been traded with countries with less relative participation in total Brazilian 
exports, such as Poland, Greece, Thailand and others.

5.2.Effects of the quality of agricultural exports on Brazilian international trade  

 

With a view to analyzing the effect of the quality of agricultural exports on Brazilian trade 
relations  over  the  1997-2016  period,  three  main  models  were  estimated  using  the  following 
questions as a basis: (i) what is the effect of export quality on access to new markets? (model 
1); (ii) what is the effect of quality on the share traded with the new market in terms of the total 
quantity exported? (models 2 and 3); (iii) what is the effect of quality on the value exported to 
existing partners (intensive margin measure)? (models 4 and 5). The results of these different 
estimates are presented in Table 2.

The results presented in Table 2 indicated important adjustment of the models estimated, in 
which the null hypothesis of joint insignificance of the variables was statistically rejected  in 
accordance with the values of the F statistic obtained. In addition, it must be stressed that the 
cluster procedure (at product level) was performed to obtain robust standard errors, thus solving 
the  possible  bias  caused  by  heteroscedasticity.  All  estimates  were  made  considering  fixed 
effects for country, year and product, as in studies by Flach (2016), Bastos and Silva (2010), 
Martin and Mejean (2014) and others. 

Estimated model (1) shows that the increase in quality of agricultural exports is associated 
with a reduction in the probability of Brazil accessing a new market. That is not surprising given 
that a small consolidated group of countries, such as the United States, China, the Netherlands 
and others, absorbs the largest share of Brazilian exports, despite their access to a significant 
number  of  partners.  Thus,  higher  quality  products  can  be  directed  to  such  countries,  to  the 

 

11 

detriment  of  new  markets,  with  the  aim  of  intensifying  existing  trade  relations.  In  addition, 
higher quality can also imply higher priced goods, which could hinder the acquisition of such 
products by new commercial partners, thereby  explaining the negative signal of the variable 
representing the quality of Brazilian agricultural exports. 

In terms of exporting country income (GDPi) it was found that the increase in GDP is related 
to less access to new trading partners. The literature usually points to a positive effect of the 
country's  income  on  exported  value  (BASTOS;  SILVA,  2010).  According  to  information  in 
section 5.1., about 77% of commercial transactions carried out over the period occurred with 
existing  partners.  Thus,  even  if  higher  income  generates  a  greater  volume  exported,  it  is 
probable that in the Brazilian case this larger volume will be directed to already consolidated 
markets, which could explain the negative effect of income on access to new destinations. A 
similar result was found for the indicative GDP variable of the importing countries considered 
in the sample. 

The estimated coefficient for the distance variable between Brazil and the main traders had 
no statistically significant effect on the probability of accessing a new market. For the border 
variable (contig), the signal found indicated that the fact that the country has a common border 
reduces access to new markets. It should be noted that the variable for access to new markets 
refers to those situations where a country has not traded with Brazil for at least 3 consecutive 
years. However, the sample countries which border Brazil are not classified as new partners, as 
they  were  frequent  importers  during  the  period  considered  (that  is,  they  did  not  spend  3 
consecutive years without trading with Brazil). As a consequence, the border implies a lower 
probability that the commercial transaction performed represented a new market. 

On the question of the effect  of TBT notifications on the probability of Brazil accessing 
new markets, the variable coefficient presented no statistical significance. In the case of SPS 
notifications,  the  result  found  indicated  that  the  application  of  a  sanitary  and  phytosanitary 
measure by the sample importers increased the probability of Brazil entering new markets. It 
should  be  stressed  that  these  measures  can  act  as  trade  reducers  if  the  costs  involved  in 
complying with such requirements hinder exports. Therefore, when faced with the imposition 
of  an  SPS,  Brazil  would  have  an  incentive  to  access  new  markets  which  could  have  less 
restrictive measures (FREITAS et al., 2016; BURNQUIST; SOUZA, 2010). 

Estimates for the remaining models (columns 2-5) were obtained by OLS and PPML. As 
argued in section 3.2, PPML is more appropriate  for making consistent estimates because of 
the presence of null flows and heteroscedasticity. Therefore, the results generated by PPML are 
discussed, while OLS estimates are only presented to test robustness. 

Model (3) set out to estimate the effect of quality on the share of volume traded with new 
markets. The coefficient of the indicator of the quality of agricultural products indicated that 
the increase in quality is related to a smaller share marketed with new partners, which confirms 
the result obtained in model (1). In the same way, the variable representing Brazilian income 
negatively affected the proportion of the volume traded with new markets when compared with 
that  traded  with  the  others.  Income  from  importing  countries,  unlike  model  (1),  was  not 
statistically significant. 

Distance between Brazil and  its main trading partners showed a negative  and significant 
coefficient, which indicates that the more distant the importers, the less the share of trade with 
new markets. The coefficients obtained for the other variables were not statistically different 
from zero, so inferences about their effects on the share of trade relative to new destinations 
cannot be made. 

The third model estimated (columns 4-6) deals with the relationship between the quality of 
agricultural products and the value exported (US$) for the partners with which Brazil regularly 

 

12 

trades6.  As  regards  the  interest  variable,  the  results  show  that  the  higher  the  quality  of  the 
product,  the  value  exported  to  such  markets  tends  to  increase.  That  result  was  expected,  as 
higher quality can imply higher product prices which, in turn, can increase the value transacted 
even in situations where the quantity traded is maintained or reduced, as the variation in price 
is higher. 

The income variables of the countries selected also positively affected the value exported 
to  existing  Brazilian  trading  partners,  as  is  commonly  found  in  the  literature  on  the  subject 
(BASTOS; SILVA, 2010; BITTENCOURT; MATTOS; LIMA, 2016). It should be noted that 
a  recent  study  points  to  the  non-use  of  GDP  in  the  estimation  of  gravitational  equations 
(FIGUEIREDO,  LIMA, SCHAUR, 2016;  BALTAGI et  al.,  2014;  ANDERSON, 2011). The 
rationale behind this is that GDP is measured on the basis of value added, that is, it does not 
take intermediate consumer goods into account, while trade variables are given on a gross basis 
of sales (SILVA et al. 2016). Thus, the results of column (6) are presented, withdrawing the 
income of the countries of the models estimated. It can be seen that there were no changes in 
the signals or statistical significance of the variables considered. In terms of the variables border 
and  TBT  and  SPS,  the  estimated  coefficients  indicated  that  they  did  not  affect  the  value 
exported to existing markets. 

For the variable indicating the distance between countries (lndist), the estimated coefficient 
pointed to a direct relation with the value exported. Although this result was not expected, it is 
known that the largest volumes traded occurred with  trading partners relatively more distant 
from Brazil, such as China, the United States, the Netherlands, among others (see section 5.1). 
Therefore, in this case it was expected that distance would not negatively affect export value. 
It is also important to note that, as argued by Novy (2008), caution should be exercised when 
using distance as the only variable to represent transport costs between countries. According to 
Bastos and Silva (2016), and Kugler and Verhoogen (2008), higher quality products are directed 
to more distant markets7. In this sense, the higher price obtained (consonant with higher quality) 
can  compensate  for  transport  costs,  and  thus,  the  distance  coefficient  would  not  negatively 
affect the volume of Brazilian agricultural exports. 
 

5.3.Export quality, income, distance and SPS and TBT measures 

 

This section presents the results of the models estimated to analyze the relationship between 
the quality of agricultural products exported by Brazil, the income of the exporting country, the 
distance  between  the  partners  and  the  issuance  of  SPS  and  TBT  notifications  by  the  main 
importers. Different empirical models were estimated, as shown in Table 3 (columns 1-7) as a 
means  of  testing  robustness.  In  general,  the  results  were  satisfactory  where  the  estimated 
coefficients  presented  statistical  significance  and  signals  similar  to  those  presented  by  other 
studies dealing with the theme (BALDWIN; HARRIGAN, 2011; JOHNSON, 2012; BASTOS; 
SILVA, 2010; HALLACK, 2006). 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

                                                           
6 It should be noted that even if a country fails to trade with Brazil for up to 2 consecutive years, it is still considered 
a regular partner and is not classified as a new market. 
7 These issues were dealt with in greater depth in section 4.3.

According  to  all  the  models  estimated,  the  Brazilian  GDP  coefficient  was  positive  and 
statistically significant at 5%. It was seen that positive changes in the income of the exporting 
country positively affected the quality of Brazilian exports of agricultural products. Thus, the 
results were consistent with the hypothesis that the higher the income of countries, the greater 
the quality of their exported products, because they can make better investments in products, 
processes,  and  human  capital  etc.  In  this  context,  a  study  by  Filho,  Medeiros  and 
Albuquerquemello (2017), using data on exports from the Brazilian manufacturing industry to 
193 commercial partners over the 1997-2014 period, also found results showing the positive 
effect of GDP on the quality of exported products. 

In terms of the distance variable, the estimated coefficients were statistically significant and 
positively related to the quality of exports of Brazilian agricultural products. These results are 
corroborated by Baldwin and Harrigan (2011), Johnson (2012) and Bastos and Silva (2010) and 
indicate that higher quality agricultural products were allocated to more distant trading partners. 
For  the  SPS  and  TBT  notifications  on  agricultural  products  issued  by  the  main  trading 
partners,  the  estimated  coefficients  were  positive  and  statistically  significant.  The  results 
showed that countries imposing such measures import higher quality agricultural products. This 
positive  effect  could  be  related  to  the  fact  that,  when  notified  with  SPS and  TBT  measures, 
Brazilian exporters were informed about these requirements and their benefits in terms of safety 
and quality of products. They were thus able to adapt and this resulted in the export of higher 
quality products.

Table  4  presents  the  results  of  the  unconditional  quantile  regression.  The  results  for  the 
GDP variable indicate that there are statistically significant differences of the income effect of 
the  exporting  country  (Brazil)  along  the  distribution  of  export  quality.  The  effect  of  income 
increases  when  higher  levels  of  quality  are  considered,  which  indicates  that  as  Brazilian 
incomes grow, larger investments are made in the agricultural sector, leading to the production 
and export of products of even higher quality. These products, in turn, are mostly absorbed by 
trading  partners  who  have  a  consumer  market  with  purchasing  power  and  a  preference  for 
product baskets of higher quality. These results confirm those found, in studies, such as those 
of Bastos and Silva (2010) and Jaimovich and Merella (2015). 

The estimated results for the distances of the countries (lndist) confirmed the positive effect 
on the quality of exports identified in the previous estimation. The highest coefficient was seen 
for the lowest quality quantiles (q25), which indicates that, for those products grouped at the 
bottom  of  the  quality  distribution,  distance  exerts  even  greater  influence.  Products  such  as 
“cereals” and “products of the milling industry; malts; starches; inulin; wheat gluten”, identified 
in the sample with the lowest average quality index, make up a large share of Brazil's exports 
and are generally directed towards more distant markets, such as Asia and United States, and 
could explain the coefficient obtained. 

For the SPS notifications, the results showed that the emission of  such notifications was 
related to the higher quality of products  along the distribution, and this effect  was  relatively 
greater for the median. As for the estimated coefficients for TBT notification, a greater effect 
was identified at the bottom of the quality distribution. For quantiles referring to the highest 
quality exports (q 75), the results pointed to a reduction in the quality of exports to countries 
which issued TBT notifications. That is not surprising, as such products already have a high 
level of quality and, therefore, investments to comply with the new requirements of technical 
measures tend to represent a significant increase in production costs which could restrict the 
country's capacity to maintain exports at the same quality level.

6.  Final Comments 
The  main  objective  of  this  research  was  to  analyze  the  quality  of  Brazilian  agricultural 
exports  in  the  light  of  three  issues:  (i)  what  is  the  effect  of  export  quality  on  access  to  new 
markets?; (ii) what is the effect of quality on the share traded with the new market in relation 
to the total volume exported?; (iii) what is the effect of quality on the value exported to existing 
partners (intensive margin measure)? 

Among the results obtained for the analyses relating to trade with new markets, negative 
effects of quality were identified both for the probability of accessing new markets and for the 
share  of  trade  transactions  involving  them.  For  the  intensive  margin,  the  value  exported  to 
existing partners, the estimated coefficients  showed that the increase in  quality is  associated 
with  a  higher  level  of  exportation.  This  research  confirms  hypotheses  raised  by  studies 
analyzing  the  relationship  between  quality  and  international  trade,  namely,  it  showed  that 
income  and  distance  have  a  positive  effect  on  quality,  and  that  this  income  effect  grows  as 
different levels of quality are considered. In addition, the issuance of SPS and TBT measures 
by  Brazilian  importers  also  led  to  an  improvement  in  the  quality  of  Brazilian  agricultural 
products exported. 

The  present  study  highlights  the  relevance  of  investment  in  the  quality  of  agricultural 
products if Brazil is to maintain and increase the value of its exports to those countries who are 
consolidated partners and responsible for absorbing the greater part of its exports directed to 
the international market. However, as the results have shown that product quality reduces entry 
into new markets, it is also important to draft policies to facilitate for these products, possibly 
in terms of better prices, to access different markets and thus make the Brazilian export agenda 
more dynamic. 

In terms of future research, sample disaggregation at the Brazilian exporting firm level is 
suggested. This could lead to the generation of more plausible estimates and thereby eliminate 
the  possible  bias  caused  by  the  aggregation  of  information  at  the  product  level.  Different 
measures  of  product  quality  could  also  be  considered  as  a  means  towards  analyzing  the 
robustness of the results.
