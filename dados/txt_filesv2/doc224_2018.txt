Abstract 

 
This paper explores for the first time the impact of a demand-driven training program on 
labor turnover at both worker and firm level. Launched in 2014 by the Ministry of 
Development, Industry and Trade (MDIC in Portuguese), Pronatec-MDIC allows firms to 
demand courses and nominate some of their workers. Difference-in-difference estimates finds 
that job tenure of workers that graduate from courses that their employers demand increases 
by 6 months. Labor turnover within demanding firms varies when considering different 
groups of workers who participate and did not participate in Pronatec-MDIC. These results 
show that turnover is greater when considering turnover not related to job creation or 
destruction (churning). This suggests that trained workers become more productive after the 
course and can replace more non-trained workers, leading to higher productivity gains in the 
short run. Results also suggest that firms that apply but do not have trained workers do not go 
through this adjustment and see their turnover unchanged. 
 

Resumo 

 
Esta pesquisa explora pela primeira vez o impacto de um programa de treinamento por 
demanda sobre rotatividade em nível de trabalhador e firma. Lançado em 2014 pelo 
Ministério de Desenvolvimento, Indústria e Comércio (MDIC), Pronatec-MDIC permite às 
firmas demandar cursos e nominar trabalhadores. Estimadores de diferença-em-diferença 
encontram que a duração de emprego dos trabalhadores que se formam dos cursos 
demandados pelos seus empregadores aumenta por 6 meses. A rotatividade dentro das firmas 
demandantes varia quando consideramos diferentes grupos de trabalhadores que participam 
ou não no Pronatec-MDIC. Os resultados mostram que rotatividade é maior quando 
consideramos rotatividade não relacionada a criação e destruição de emprego. Isso sugere que 
trabalhadores treinados viram mais produtivos depois do curso e podem substituir mais 
trabalhadores não treinados, criando ganhos na produtividade no curto prazo. Os resultados 
também sugerem que as firmas que aplicam, mas que não tem trabalhadores treinados, não 
passam por esse ajuste e não observam diferenças em suas rotatividades.

I. 

Introduction:  
 

Two of the most marked features of the labor market in Brazil are its high job turnover and 
stagnant  labor  productivity.  Recent  evidence  shows  that  49.5%  of  formal  workers  switched 
jobs in 2013 (Corseuil et al., 2018b) and that labor productivity has been slowly growing at 
1.1%  per  year  in  the  past  decade  (IPEA,  2015).  While  there  is  widespread  theoretical 
recognition  that  skill  enhancement  within  a  firm  affects  turnover  and  labor  productivity 
(Arrow, 1962; Becker, 1993; ILO, 2010; BID, 2015), the literature is limited, to the best of our 
knowledge, to the impact on labor turnover at worker level (Corseuil et al., 2018a).  
 
The launch of the Programa Nacional de Ensino Técnico (Pronatec) in 2011, the supply-driven 
training program of Brazil where participants choose the courses they wish to pursue, raised 
expectations  on  the  coverage  of  technical  education.  Theory  suggests  that  as  workers  get 
trained and stay longer, they accumulate experience, absorb firm-level knowledge, and become 
more  productive  (Arrow,  1962;  Becker,  1993).  While  no  evaluations  have  assessed  this 
hypothesis, aggregated data available for the period after the introduction of the Pronatec shows 
that the turnover rate from 2011 to 2013 dropped slightly from 53.7 % to 49.5% (Corseuil et 
al.,  2018b),  but  labor  productivity  decreased  0.6  p.p.  from  2008-2010  to  2011-2013  (IPEA, 
2015).  
 
This paper tries to assess how skill enhancement and turnover are correlated at both worker 
and  firm  level.  We  do  so  by  assessing  the  impact  of  the  demand-driven  training  version  of 
Pronatec  launched  in  2014  by  the  Ministry  of  Development,  Industry  and  Trade  (MDIC  in 
Portuguese).  The  Pronatec-MDIC  version  allows  firms  to  demand  courses  some  of  their 
workers take.  
 
This  study  employs  propensity  score  matching  (PSM)  and  difference-in-differences 
estimations to compare firms and workers that demand and participate in the training program 
to those with similar  characteristics  who do  not. To do so, we match  administrative data  of 
applications  of  firms  and  workers  for  the  2014-2016  period  to  a  longitudinal  employer-
employee  database  for  the  2012-2017  period5.  The  result  is  a  comprehensive  database  that 
enables us to track employment and firm dynamics before and after program application. 
 
Initial evaluations of both supply- and demand-driven Pronatec are inconclusive. Barbosa et 
al. (2016) compares workers dismissed in 2011 who complete the short-duration training (FIC) 
courses between 2011 - 2013 with those who register but do not receive a confirmation. The 
researchers find that workers who complete the supply-driven training do not present higher 
employment probability or returns than those who do not get an application confirmation.  
 
Conversely, Almeida et al. (2015) argues that the impact of training varies by provider, course 
type  and  economic  activity.  The  study  employs  PSM  techniques  to  compare  students  who 
complete  various  modalities  of  technical  education  with  students  who  follow  a  general 
education  track.  They  find  that  students  in  courses  privately  managed  and  working  in  the 
manufacturing sector earn higher wages than those who follow the general education track.  
The  launch  of  the  demand-driven  version  of  Pronatec  in  2014  further  promoted  the  debate. 
Recent evidence of the program suggests that allowing employers  to signal course demands 
increases the probability of employment but do not induce wage gains considerably (O’Connel 
et  al.,  2017).  It  also  confirms  that  employment  effects  are  more  effective  in  skill-intensive

occupations like manufacturing. Despite these initial efforts to evaluate Pronatec, none of the 
studies explores the turnover of workers.  
 
Corseuil  et  al.  (2018a)  assess  the  impact  of  training  on  labor  turnover  but  using  the 
apprenticeship law. Launched in 2000, the law provides tax breaks to firms that offer 2-year 
contracts to young individuals age 14 to 24 while promoting in-class and on-the-job training. 
They exploit a change in 2005 in the maximum age requirements (from 17 to 24) to evaluate 
the  impact  on  labor  turnover.  Using  regression  discontinuity,  they  find  a  reduction  in  the 
turnover of workers who find their first job in large firms. However, they do not  explore the 
effect on firms and their analysis is restricted to young workers with no prior experience.  
 
We instead look at labor turnover at worker and firm level to understand how turnover may 
differ for workers, whether enrolled or not, and within firms, whether they apply to the program 
or not. Our analysis is not immune to identification limitations. Individuals who apply to the 
program  might  participate  for  reasons  other  than  class  cancellation  or  oversubscription, 
arguably uncorrelated to their personal characteristics. The comparison of the characteristics 
of these groups points to this direction. Additionally, at firm level, a protocol to select firms 
whose course demands are approved does not seem to exist. Firms more likely to be selected 
are, on average, large and may have an incentive to secure workers they invest in. To minimize 
such limitations, we apply PSM to workers and firms and control for time and unit effects. 
 
The paper  is structured  as follows. In  the  first  two  sessions we cover the regional and  local 
literature on the impact of skill enhancement on labor market outcomes, with a special focus 
on labor turnover. In the third session we briefly describe the statistics of firms and workers 
that apply to the program. In the fourth session we delved into the methodology and present 
the results in the fifth one. Finally, we conclude and provide policy implications for Pronatec 
and technical course design in Brazil.  
 

II. 

Background of training programs 
 

A.  Training in the region 

The main conclusion arising from the literature is that supply-driven training programs yield 
heterogeneous results (Card et al., 2010). In 1986, the U.S. Department of Labor created the 
largest  randomized  evaluation  of  a  supply-driven  training,  the  Job  Training  Partnership  Act 
(Doolittle et al., 1993). This study spearheaded efforts to generate a credible estimate of what 
would happen to beneficiaries receiving training in the absence of it. Its focus was to assess the 
impact  of  training  on  two  common  labor  market  outcomes:  employment  and  wages.  In  this 
case, having access to the training increased the percentage of women employed by 2.1 p.p. 
and that of men by 2.8 p.p. 18 months after the program finished. It also  rose the 18-month 
wages of adult women by 7.2 percent, but not that of adult men (Bloom et al., 1993).  
 
In Latin America, randomized evaluations of hybrid programs have taken place in Colombia, 
the Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Argentina. In Colombia, Attanasio et al. (2011) found 
that participating in Jóvenes en Acción, a 3-month vocational training combined with a 3-month 
apprenticeship, increases the probability of formal employment and higher wages in the short 
term.  A  subsequent  study  shows  that  unemployed  poor  female  workers  aged  18  to  25  earn 
sustained  higher  wages  10  years  after  the  intervention.  Program  participation  of  men  has 
similar effects on employment but induces none on wages (Attanasio et al., 2015).  
 

2 

 

In  the  Dominican  Republic,  benefiting  from  Juventud  y  Empleo,  technical  and  vocational 
courses followed by an internship, led to positive impact on wages but not on employment one 
year after (Card et al., 2011). More recently, the program documents widening employability 
gap between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries 6 years after graduating from the program but 
did not find effects on overall employment (Ibarrarán et al., 2015). Moreover, male students 
obtain an 8 p.p. increase in employment but no wage gains, while women saw no impact in 
neither. 
 
In  line  with  these  mixed  results,  a  medium-term  RCT  of  Entra21,  a  program  in  Cordoba, 
Argentina  which  combines  technical  and  life-skills  training  with  internships,  estimates 
employment increases of 8 p.p. with wages being 40 percent higher than the control group 1.5 
years after the program (Alzúa et al., 2015). However, the effects remain stable for men but 
dissipate for women 3 years later. A study in Uruguay also estimates that participating in Yo 
Estudio  y  Trabajo,  a  1-year  apprenticeship  program  in  public  enterprises,  increases  the 
probability of finding a job 2 years after the program, but only for a specific age cohort (Araya 
and Rivero, 2016). Students ages 18 or 19 who did not hold a formal job before were 9 p.p. 
more likely to find employment.  
 
In synthesis, supply-driven training programs combined with internships/apprenticeships may 
yield positive employment effects. These effects seem to be mixed and vary by gender in the 
short run while showing sustained impacts in the long run. Heterogeneous impacts may be the 
results of program design. Some programs use training vouchers, which makes it difficult for 
students to find training providers. Others complement training with work, turning difficult for 
students  to  find  a  firm  willing  to  offer  a  contract  or  balance  the  workload  demand  (J-PAL, 
2017).  
 

B.  Training in Brazil 

Initial evaluations of supply-driven training focused on measuring the impact on employment 
and wages. Evaluations of the National Plan of Professional Training (Planfor) and Education 
of Youth and Adults (EJA) assessed the impact of supply-driven training on employment and 
earnings  (Musse  and  Machado,  2013;  Firpo,  Fogel,  and  Jales,  2014).  Other  researchers 
assessed labor market  outcomes such  as  the probability  of (un)employment and  its duration 
(Paes de Barros et al., 2011; Neri, 2012) and potential earnings (Fernandes, Menezes-Filho e 
Zylberstajn, 2000).  
 
More  recently,  with  the  launch  of  Pronatec,  also  a  supply-driven  training  program,  some 
evaluations have shed light on how the program affects labor reinsertion. Barbosa-Filho et al. 
(2015)  uses  probit  regression  to  estimate  the  reinsertion  probability  of  workers  who  were 
unemployed in 2011 and graduate from short-term (FIC) Pronatec courses. It finds that access 
to  training  does  not  affect  positively  the  employment  probability  of  students  who  complete 
training vis-à-vis those who register but do not receive enrollment confirmation. 
  
Unlike supply-driven training, demand-driven training adjusts to the needs of trainees. It allows 
beneficiaries  to  select  the  training  they  wish  to  pursue  and  even  select  providers  that  better 
suites them. The few evaluations which have explored the effect of demand-driven training in 
Brazil,  have  also  assessed  employment  probability  and  earnings.  O’Connel  et  al.  (2017) 
exploits the program design  of Pronatec-MDIC, which  leaves  out  for administrative reasons 
workers who register for training. Employing a difference-in-differences instrumental variable 
strategy, the study finds that participating  increases the probability of employment by 2 to 3 
percent points in the year after program completion without affecting earnings.

That said, the literature on the impact of demand-driven training on labor turnover is limited to 
Corseuil et al. (2018a). The authors exploit a change in the age eligibility of the Apprenticeship 
Law6. The law states that firms can hire young workers under an apprenticeship contract and 
indicate  which  intensive  in-classroom  courses  they  should  take  in  exchange  of  payroll 
subsidies.  
 
Using partially fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD) and adjusted matching method, 
the authors find that demand-driven training decreases turnover in the short and medium term. 
After  controlling  for  determinants  of  program  participation,  the  number  of  admissions  was 
16.7%  lower  than  temporary  contracts  2-3  years  after  and  20.6%  lower  4-5  years  later. 
Similarly, dismissals decrease by 37.9% after 2-3 years and by 20.9% after 3-5 years.  
 
Evidence of whether Pronatec beneficiaries switch jobs quick is non-existent to the best of our 
knowledge. This paper thus intends to fill this gap by assessing the impact of Pronatec-MDIC 
on job turnover.  
 

C.  Training models 

Models  of  job  turnover  claim  that  turnover  does  not  necessarily  generate  bad  outcomes 
according  to  Jovanovic  (1979a,  1979b).  It  can  either  improve  job  matching  as  information 
about the job and the candidate is revealed in the first months after placement. Or it can worsen 
the possibility of accumulating human capital unavailable in classrooms such as firm-specific 
and non-cognitive skills. 
 
On the other hand, models of productivity also assert that the more a worker produces (Arrow, 
1962) and the more qualified the worker is (Becker, 1962), the more experience it obtains and 
the more efficient it becomes at producing its tasks. Both theories suggest that productivity is 
a  function  of  learning  over time. Firms with  higher  levels  of  turnover  may  compromise the 
learning accumulation  of their workers and  their productivity as a consequence.  The reason 
may be that high turnover is associated with low levels of commitment and training, from both 
the workers’ and firms’ side.  
 
Stylized facts suggest turnover is high in Brazil compared to international standards (Corseuil 
et. al., 2002; Gonzaga, 2003). Corseuil et al. (2014) finds that turnover7 is especially high for 
young workers compared to their adult peers. High youth turnover is concentrated in younger 
workers (ages 18 - 24) with low schooling (up to lower secondary school) who earn low wages, 
which makes them easily substitutable. 
 
We also know that youth turnover is not explained by the proportion of young workers entering 
short-term contracts but by dismissals  associated with replacement for other young workers. 
On one hand, the percentage of young workers hired through temporary contracts did not reach 
more than 16% between 1996 and 2010 compared to 43% in European countries (O’Higgins, 
2012). Although this phenomenon may be changing. On the other hand, 68.6% of the turnover 
rate8 in 2014 stems from separations due to  firm decisions.  In  fact, the proportion  of  young 

                                                 
6 From 2000-2005 only individuals 14 to 17 years of age were eligible to the program. From 2005 onward, individuals 14 to 24 years old 
became eligible.  
7 Measured as the difference between hirings and separations in a given year divided by the number of workers active at the end of the 
year.  
8 Measured as the smallest amount between admitted and dismissed workers divided by the number of workers active at the end of a 
given year under the regime of the consolidation of the labor laws (CLT by its initials in Portuguese). The rates exclude those dismissals

workers’ separations due to substitutions for workers of the same age group was 65% in 2010, 
and it has grown 12 percent points since 1996 (Corseuil et al., 2013).  
 
These facts may imply that, if firms invest in their employees, they may have fewer incentives 
to dismiss them and replace them for other workers, allowing them to stay longer. However, 
the opposite can be true. A recent paper by Rasul et al. (2017) demonstrates that demand-driven 
vocational training for youth induces higher rates of job-to-job offers, leading to greater worker 
turnover. The certifiability and transferability of the skills accumulated lead to matches with 
high productivity firms. Therefore, whether investing in training of workers diminish turnover 
is an empirical question that we try to answer in this quasi-experimental study that focuses on 
the job tenure of all workers and labor turnover of firms. 
 

III.  Data and descriptive statistics 

 

We use administrative data  of  Pronatec-MDIC course applications  for the  years 2014-2016. 
We use this information to retrieve course application, acceptance and rejection proportions as 
well as dropout and graduation rates. We then match the data with employment records of firms 
using  the  Annual  Report  of  Social  Information  (RAIS  in  Portuguese)  for  2011-2017.  The 
matched data allow us to obtain the employment status and characteristics of workers (enrolled 
in Pronatec-MDIC  or  not)  who  are employed by  the firms that demand the  Pronatec-MDIC 
course.    
 
The first part of the data is from Pronatec-MDIC. Pronatec was established in 2011 to promote 
the inclusion of vulnerable groups in vocational and technical education. The MDIC version 
of Pronatec was then launched in 2014 to align course supply to the demand of firms in the 
manufacturing, trade, and service industries. As summarized in annex I, the program protocol 
involves several steps, from the moment firms and students apply for the program separately 
to the moment students graduate from the courses.  
 
Firms submit course demands and report their tax ID, the course ID, the municipality where 
the course takes place, the number of people the companies wish to train, and in some cases, 
the  occupations  they  demand  this  course  for.  As  observed  in  table  1,  5,618  firms  demand 
courses between 2014 and 2016. Around 4,300 firms submit applications in at least one year; 
1,000 in two years; and less than 200 in at least 3 years.

The Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade filters course demands based on relevance 
and necessity. Demands for English courses or with high numbers of vacancies  are rejected. 
About half of the demands are filtered out in this  stage (O’Connel et al., 2017). MDIC then 
submits the demands to the Ministry of Education (MEC) which compiles the demands from 
other  ministries  and  approves  them  based  on  budget  and  complementarity.  Similar  course 
demands from ministries, for example, are aggregated and approved. As summarized in table 

                                                 
that occur for reasons related to death, retirement, job transition and upon the worker’s request as a means to approximate turnover 
related to decisions of firms.

Once all courses are approved, MEC opens course registration and subsequent enrollment for 
students. Table 3 shows that between 2014 and 2016, 55,762 students register at least once for 
the program, but only 76.69% receive enrollment confirmation in their first attempt. Of those 
who receive an enrollment confirmation, 64.45% graduate and 25.37% drop out. Of those who 
do  not  receive  a  confirmation,  12.58%  were  not  admitted  for  administrative  reasons  (class 
cancellation and oversubscription) as observed in table 4.

The Pronatec-MDIC dataset is complemented by the RAIS 2011-2017. The RAIS is an annual 
administrative  dataset  that  contains  data  on  employment  and  earnings  of  all  the  formally-
employed workers of formally-registered firms. The RAIS includes detailed information on the 
employer and the employee (including their tax IDs), and their work relationship (wage, tenure, 
type of employment, hiring and dismissal date, and reason for dismissal).  
 
In the RAIS, we were able to match the information of 84.16% of firms that make a course 
request  at  least  once  between  2014-2016  and  65.75%  of  students  that  which  apply  to  the 
program at least once between the same timeframe. Unmatched student data in the RAIS could 
occur because the student was not formally employed within the 2011-2017 period. Combining 
both datasets allows us to trace the employment history of students before and after program 
registration, enrollment and graduation, including their turnover rates.  
 
Unlike O’Connel et al. (2017), we manage to match the class that the firm demands to the class 
the student is registered in using a unique class ID for 2015-2016. From the pool of students 
registered in these course, we filtered their first applications and whether they are employed by 
the demanding firm and enrolled at the time the course starts. We also filtered out those who 
had two simultaneous jobs.

Table 5 shows that of the 17,514 registered for firm-requested courses, 7,531 are employed at 
course onset. Of those employed, 5,824 are working for the firm that requested the course. And 
of those employed in the requesting firm, 3,497 are also enrolled in the requested courses. Out 
of  those  enrolled,  2,478  graduate  and  of  those  not  enrolled,  55  were  rejected  due  to 
administrative  reasons.  Finally,  those  working  for  requesting  firms  and  enrolled  in  the 
requested courses stay, on average, employed for 22.62 months from the moment the course 
starts. On the other hand, those employed by the requesting firm but who did not get the course 
for administrative reasons remain employed for 13 months from course onset.

IV.  Methodology 

 
We wish to measure the impact of firm application and nomination for course enrollment on 
job tenure and labor turnover. To do so, we split the methodology at employee and firm level. 
 

A.  Worker level 

 
In the case of employees, we wish to measure the impact that being nominated by the firm to 
participate and graduate from a firm-demanded course has on  job tenure.  Ideally, we would 
use administrative constraints as an exogenous source of variation for understanding the impact 
of the program on employees. That is, use as counterfactual the employees that apply to courses 
demanded by the firms, but who are denied access for reasons unrelated to their characteristics.  
 
However,  there  is  no  nomination  protocol  and  the  characteristics  of  employees  rejected  for 
administrative reasons are not similar to that of the treatment group, in part because there are 
few employees that fulfill these conditions (table 6). To construct a credible comparison group 
of workers with similar characteristics to minimize a potential self-selection issue, the study 
uses Propensity Score Matching (PSM) (Heckman et al., 1997).

We match  the probability  of program enrollment  of workers employed by  demanding  firms 
while enrolled in courses in 2015-16 with that of workers employed by demanding firms with 
similar characteristics who do not participate in the program. The matching is built on a logit 
model that captures the likelihood that an employee is assigned to treatment, based on its pre-
treatment characteristics such as age, gender, race, location, education level, job tenure, annual 
average wage, number of registrations, and enrollment attempts. The match produces treatment 
and  comparison  groups  that  share  similar  characteristics  (annex  II.A.).  Both  control  and 
treatment groups are then assigned to strata according to its propensity score and the Kernel 
regression estimator chooses the weights so that the closest observations receive greater weight 
(figure 1).

We then follow the job tenure of workers until 2017. To estimate job tenure, we calculate the 
duration of employment from the moment the course finishes to the moment of the dismissal 
or last day of 2017. To estimate the difference in job tenure for workers who enroll or graduate 
and those who do not, we estimate the following specification: 
 

𝑦𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 ⋅ 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑗 + 𝛾 ⋅ 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿 ⋅ 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑗

∗𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝜃 ⋅ 𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜑𝑖 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡 

 
Where 𝑦𝑖,𝑡is employment duration after the course starts; 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑗 are year-month dummies 
indicating whether the worker enrolls into, or graduate from, the program; and 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 accounts 
for the follow-up period. In other words, each control and treatment unit have one observation 
before  and  one  after  the  course.  We  hypothesize  that  while  enrollment  may  have  a  capital 
accumulation effect on job tenure, graduation may have a further signaling effect. Finally, we 
control for age, sex, race, location, educational level, occupation, the firm’s industry, job tenure 
before and number of registrations (𝑋𝑖𝑡) and cluster the error at state level 𝜑𝑖. We are interested 
on  the  𝛿 coefficient,  which  indicates  the  causal  impact  of  participating  in  Pronatec  on  job 
tenure.  
 

B.  Firm level 

 
In the case of firms, we wish to measure the impact that firm application has on turnover. To 
compensate for the lack of an application protocol, we create a comparison group of firms. We 
do that by using PSM. We match the probability of course approval of firms that obtain training 
for their workers with that of firms that do not but have similar characteristics. The matching 
is built on a logit model that captures the likelihood that firm is assigned to treatment based on 
its pre-treatment features such the as age, gender, race, job tenure, wage and registration and 
enrollment attempts  of workers, and the location, economic activity and size of the firm. To 
maximize  the  quality  of  the  match,  we  identify  treatment  and  comparison  groups  that  have 
similar characteristics (annex II.B.) and use a Kernel regression (figure 2).

We then follow the labor turnover of firms from 2011 until 2017, for which we calculate two 
different rates for each establishment i at the end of year t: 
 

 

Where; 

𝑅2𝑖𝑡  = (

𝐻𝑖𝑡+𝑆𝑖𝑡

𝐴𝐸𝑖𝑡

) 

) −  𝑎𝑏𝑠 |(

𝑅1𝑖𝑡  = (
𝐻𝑖𝑡+𝑆𝑖𝑡

𝐴𝐸𝑖𝑡

𝐻𝑖𝑡−𝑆𝑖𝑡

𝐴𝐸𝑖𝑡

)| 

2

(𝐸𝑖𝑒𝑡+𝐸𝑖𝑒𝑡−1)

; is the average number of workers between two consecutive 

𝐻𝑖𝑡 = admissions in firm 𝑖 at time 𝑡 
𝑆𝑖𝑡 = separations in firm 𝑖 at time 𝑡 
𝐴𝐸𝑖𝑡  =
periods in establishment i at time t 
𝑅1𝑖𝑡  = is the job flow or the rate at which workers enter and leave a firm i at the end 
of time t (Corseuil et al., 2013) 
𝑅2𝑖𝑡  = is the churning rate or the rate at which workers enter and leave a firm not 
because job creation or destruction (Corseuil et al., 2013) 

 
In  other  words,  while  the  two  job  turnover  rates  consider  the  flow  of  admissions  and/or 
separations over the average stock of workers between two consecutive years, 𝑅1𝑖𝑡  focuses on 
the overall flow of workers while 𝑅2𝑖𝑡 takes on the flow not caused by job creation/destruction. 
To estimate the difference in job tenure of firms which experience the treatment and those not 
exposed to it, we estimate the following regression: 
 

𝑦𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 ⋅ 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖 + 𝛾 ⋅ 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿 ⋅ 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐∗𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝜃 ⋅ 𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜑𝑖 + 𝜎𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡 

Where 𝑦𝑖,𝑡is job turnover after the first application to the program; 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖 is a year-month 
dummy  indicating  whether  the  firm  participates  in  the  program  and  𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡  accounts  for  the 
follow-up period. In other words, each control and treatment unit have one observation before 
and one after the course. Finally, 𝜑𝑖 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜎𝑡 are a full set of firm and time effects that accounts 
for the potential impact that covariate and idiosyncratic shocks may have on job turnover.  
 
We then control for the average age, sex, race, educational level, occupation, job tenure, wage 
and registration rate of the workers within the firm as well as the location, economic activity 

  10 

and size of the firm. We also control for the number of attempts a worker makes to pursue a 
course  as  a  proxy  for  will  to  thrive  which  is  unobservable.  We  are  interested  on  the 
𝛿 coefficient, which indicates the causal impact of participating in Pronatec on job turnover.

Enrollment 
 
We find evidence that workers who enroll stay on average 7 months longer than workers of the 
same firm who do not enroll in a training course. The result (table 7) is significant at 95%.

Graduation 

Similarly, we find evidence that workers who graduate stay on average 6.3 months longer than 
workers of the same  firm who do  not graduate.  These results are consistent with the  human 
capital (Becker 1962, 1993) and  job market signaling (Spence, 1973) models. On  one hand, 
the 7 months differential between enrolled and non-enrolled workers suggests that investing in 
training that is applied on the job enhances capital accumulation and induces experience. That 
is, doing the course makes workers accumulate skills, become more productive and thus stay 
longer as they gain experience.

Furthermore, graduating from the course can also send a signal to the employer beyond capital 
accumulation. Finalizing the course can indicate the employer that the worker has  diligently 
completed  the  course  requirements,  acquired  the  most  amount  of  competences  possible  and 
thus inducing an extra 6.3 months of job tenure compared to non-enrolled peers.  
 

B.  Firm level 

At firm level, we find mixed results. The findings are presented for two types of job turnover 
rates (job flow and churning) and groups (all workers, Pronatec applicants and non-applicants). 
In general terms, we find evidence that having courses approved increases the labor turnover 
of firms when using data for all workers and Pronatec applicants.  

More specifically,  overall  labor turnover (R1)  for  treated firms  increases by 0.046 and 0.23 
when  accounted  for all workers  and Pronatec  applicants, respectively (table 9). That  is,  for 
every  20  workers  employed  within  two  consecutive  periods  after  the  intervention,  1  and  5 
workers are either hired or dismissed. In the same line, having course approved increases the 
labor turnover rate not associated with job creation and destruction (R2) by 0.025 and 0.226 
points for firms when considering all workers and Pronatec-applicants, respectively (table 9). 
When  considering  workers  who  do  not  apply,  turnover  decreases  but  the  effect  is  not 
significant. We show the results of the minimum turnover (R3) in annex III. 

Turnover rate 1:  𝑅1𝑖𝑡  = (

𝐻𝑖𝑡+𝑆𝑖𝑡

The adjustment in turnover is not immediate and decreases over time. In the first year after the 
course demand, the labor turnover of trained and non-trained workers does not change. Then 
the second year, when the adjustment occurs, turnover increases more for trainees (0.090 (R1) 
and  0.137  (R2))  than  non-trainees  (0.063  (R1)  and  0.058  (R2)).  However,  with  time,  the 
turnover  decreases  in  the  third  year  more  substantially  for  trainees  (-0.203  (R1)  and  -0.263 
(R2)) than non-trainees (-0.034 (R1) and -0.051 (R2)). Put differently, qualified workers switch 
jobs more in the non-immediate short run than non-trainees but revert the process more in the 
medium run.

The  greater  turnover  for  trained  workers  in  the  second  year  might  be  associated  with  more 
productive workers leaving firms increasing productivity in the hiring firms. The reduction in 
turnover for trained workers in the third year might be associated with a firm retaining more 
qualified workers. If these findings were hold true, we would expect to observe the turnover 
effect to dissipate completely over time as firms adjust to normal after taking advantage of the 
productivity gain, a hypothesis we would be able to test with a longer timeframe.  

VI.  Conclusion and policy implications 

The labor market in Brazil has been characterized for high labor turnover and stagnant worker 
productivity.  The  launch  of  Pronatec  in  2011,  a  supply-driven  training  program  where 
participants  choose  the  courses  they  wish  to  pursue,  raised  expectations  on  whether  capital 
accumulation  could  diminish  labor  turnover  and  increase  productivity.  The  launch  of  a 
demand-driven  version  of  Pronatec  in  2014  by  the  Ministry  of  Development,  Industry  and 
Trade, where firms could demand courses some of their workers could take, further the debate.   

This paper explores for the first time the impact of a demand-driven training program on labor 
turnover at both worker and firm level. It finds that while job tenure of workers that enroll and 
graduate from courses that their employers demand increases by 7 and 6 months respectively, 
the  labor  turnover  of  demanding  firms  increases  between  0.20  and  0.05  points.  That  is,  for 
every  20  workers  hired  in  two  consecutive  periods  after  the  intervention,  between  1  and  4 
workers are admitted or separated. These results seem to dissipate overtime. 

These findings may suggest that turnover is in fact induced by qualification as opposed to job 
creation  or  destruction  and  that  participating  larger  firms  make  stronger  adjustments.  These 
firms may nominate their best workers to the courses, making them more qualified and capable 
of performing the job of one or more non-trained workers, leading to higher productivity gains 
and worker substitution. The adjustment is not immediate though and may converge overtime. 
Turnover only  increases the second  year after the course demand but decreases a  year  later, 
suggesting that it takes time for the effect of training to kick in and reverts with time.  
 
The policy implications  of these results are that large scale training programs in Brazil need 
reform as workers may be trapped  in a  vicious cycle in which  high turnover disincentivizes 
education  and  training  even  when  offered  for  free.  Thus,  when  training  demanded  by  their 
employees results  in higher job duration within that firm, workers can be more motivated to 
invest and break this vicious cycle. The fact that only one Ministry employs this demand-driven 
design  out  of  21  eligible  Ministries  provides  an  opportunity  to  switch  to  a  demand-driven 
training model to improve labor turnover in the long run9, a phenomenon that may be holding 
back the labor productivity potential of firms in the country. Also, this supply-driven programs 
spent BRL 2.4 billion annually  in 201510 while demand-driven programs  can be more cost-
effective. 

 

                                                 
9 It is paramount to understand that some supply-driven programs have social objectivities where this statement may not apply like re-
insertion of former convicts, insured workers, among others.
