Practice Location of Physicians: A Discrete

Choice Model Approach

Let´ıcia Nunes 1 Francisco Costa 2 F´abio Sanches 3

Abstract

Economists and policymakers have long been concerned with increasing the supply of health

professionals in rural and remote areas. This work seeks to understand which factors inﬂuence

physicians’ choice of practice location right after completing residency. Diﬀerently from previous

papers we analyse the Brazilian missalocation and assess the particularities of developing coun-

tries. We use a discrete choice model approach with a multinomial logit speciﬁcation. Two rich

databases are employed containing the location and wage of formally employed physicians as

well as details from their post-graduation. Our main ﬁndings are that amenities matter, physi-

cians have a strong tendency to remain in the region they completed residency and salaries are

signiﬁcant in the choice of urban, but not countryside communities. We conjecture this is due

to attachments built during training and infrastructure concerns.

Keywords: Physician labor, underserved areas, discrete choice model, multinomial logit.

Introduction

In many developed countries, despite the substantial growth in the total number of
physicians, their maldistribution across regions persists. Rural areas and outskirts of big
metropolis still suﬀer from the shortage of these professionals, entailing unequal access to
health care. For this reason, physician supply in medically underserved regions became
a main concern for policymakers and economists.

Some governments have implemented policies to address these distributional imbal-
ances. Their aim is to act upon the physicians’ choice of practice location. For in-
stance, in 1970, the United States created the National Health Services Corps (NHSC),
a program that tries to encourage newly trained physicians to work in medically under-
served communities. It relies in loan forgiveness options and scholarships programs with
a return-in-service provision. For every year that the student receives a scholarship, he
has a contractual obligation to serve one year at a location deﬁned by the Corps. The
program has also the goal to encourage professionals to remain in the placement location
after the funding is complete.

In Canada, since 1982, the provincial government of Qu´ebec has developed a whole set
of incentive measures to inﬂuence its geographical distribution of physicians. The country
health system is based on the Universal health Insurance Plan and has uniform medicare
fees. This tend to intensify the ineﬃcient spacial allocation of health professionals, since
prices cannot adjust to equilibrate demand and supply. The measures implemented try to
bypass this restriction through scholarships programs, settlement grants, relocation reim-
bursement, continuing education opportunities and a program of regionally diﬀerentiated
remuneration for recently graduated physicians.

This is an even bigger challenge for developing countries, where rural and remote
communities usually lack the basic health infrastructure and do not oﬀer a reasonable
quality of life for it’s citizens. Physicians claim it is diﬃcult and many times unsafe to
help diseased people in such areas, because essential equipments and medications are
in short of supply. This makes these regions much more undesirable, discouraging even
professionals who have preferences for working in needy places. As can be seen in Figure
1, Brazil is a developing country with a sizeable misallocation of physicians between
States’ capital and countryside.

In the face of this impressive supply gap between rural and urban regions, Brazil
has recently emerged as a developing country trying to address the maldistribution of
physicians in its large geographical area. In 2011, the government created the Primary
Care Professional Valorization Program (Provab).
It intends to attract newly trained
physicians to needy regions through two incentives: a sizeable remuneration and a 10%
increase in the scoring of medical residency exams. In 2013, the country also implemented
the More Physicians program.
It’s main goal is to create ten thousand primary care

jobs in underserved communities for Brazilian and foreign physicians. The program is
also increasing the number of medical schools and medical residency programs in areas
suﬀering from shortages, such as the North and North-east of the country.

The analysis of such incentive policies requires a clear understanding of the factors that
inﬂuence physicians practice location decisions. Our project aims, ﬁrst, to quantify the
importance of aspects such as remuneration, birth and study place, health infrastructure
and life quality in the decision of physicians that recently graduated or completed their
residency in Brazil. We will use comprehensive data of all physicians that got a generalist
or specialist medical degree between 2002 and 2013 linked to the oﬃcial records of formal
employees from the Ministry of Labor and Employment in Brazil. With it, we intend to
estimate a random coeﬃcients multinomial logit model of physician’s demand for practice
location right after the conclusion of their medical studies.

Second, we will use the estimates obtained to simulate the eﬀect of various mea-
sures that inﬂuence initial location choices of new generalist and specialist physicians.
The counterfactual analysis done involves enhancing the health infrastructure in rural
and remote communities, raising its average salary and simulating the setting of more
graduation and residency programs in these regions, by assuming that part of physicians
workforce ﬁnished its graduation and post-graduation in them. The study will consider
the impact of each measure on specialist and generalist physicians separately.

The more recent articles in conformity with the methodology used in this work are
Hurley(1991), Bolduc et al. (1996), Homes(2005) and Agarwal (2014). All four articles
model the physician preferences thought a utility maximization framework. Hurley(1991)
estimates the parameters through a nested logit and ﬁnds that income is statistically

3

signiﬁcant and plays a important role in physicians decisions. The estimation strategy
of Bolduc et al. (1996) is a spatially autoregressive multinomial probit. Their results
provide evidence that the measures implemented by Qu´eebec government inﬂuence the
physicians choice of location. Holmes (2005) implements a sequential multinomial logit
with discrete unobserved heterogeneity and ﬁnds that eliminating the NHSC program in
the United States would decrease the supply of physciains in medically underserved areas
by roughtly 10%. At last, Agarwal (2014) develops a framework that estimates preferences
in a many-to-one matching market using only observed matches. With this procedure,
he estimates the preference distribution in the market for family medicine residents and
analyses wage and supply policies aimed at increasing the number of residents training
in rural areas.

The contribution to this literature will come in two fronts. First, we will estimate
physician’s preference parameters using a random coeﬃcients multinomial logit, which is
a much more ﬂexible model than the ones used in Hurley (1991), Bolduc et al. (1996)
and Holmes (2005). Unlike standard logit, this methodology allows for random taste
variation and unrestricted substitution patterns. Mixed logit also exceeds probit since
it is not restricted to normal distributions. Therefore our approach may provide better
estimates for the physicians preferences. Second, we expand the study of physician’s
practice location choices to developing countries by using data on Brazilian profession
also who recently graduated or completed their residency. Speciﬁcally, we will analyse
more thoroughly the importance of a good healthcare infrastructure and of amenities in
their choice, given that these are more preeminent issues in these countries.

The present work shows the ﬁrst steps taken to achieve the goals described above.
We use comprehensive data of all physicians that completed medical residency between
2002 and 2010 linked to the oﬃcial records of formal employees from the Ministry of
Labor and Employment in Brazil. With it, we estimate a standard multinomial logit
model of physician’s demand for practice location right after the conclusion of their post-
graduation. The results obtained, which we consider preliminary, suggest that rural
residency enhances retention of physicians in such areas. Also, professionals ﬁnishing
obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics and family medicine residencies seem to have an
increased probability of choosing to work in countryside communities. Amenities such as
region’s education and health appear to be as important in their decision. An intriguing
result is that wages are signiﬁcant only for metropolitan regions, but not for the coun-
tryside. Finally, the living costs also seems to aﬀects negatively the decision to work in
a certain area.

This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we provide an overview of the brazilian
health system, a description of the data used and summary statistics regarding it. We
then present the theoretical model of physicians’ initial practice location and our empirical
speciﬁcation in Section 3. The estimation results are discussed in section 4. The ﬁnal

section concludes with an analysis of which steps should be taken next, together with
some thoughts on the implications these preliminary results have for public policies in
developing countries.

2 Background and Data

In this section we ﬁrst describe the brazilian health system, explain how physicians degrees
and resident specialist degrees are awarded and discuss the supply of these professionals
over the country. Then, we characterize the data used and present it’s summary statistics.

2.1 Brazilian Health System

The Brazilian health system is based on the Federal Constitution of 1988, which
deﬁned healthcare as a citizen’s right and a state’s duty.
In order to translate this
basic right into practice, the Uniﬁed Health System, known as SUS, was created, which
universally supplies preventive and curative care through a decentralized management.
It is now the largest public health system in the world, providing complete coverage for
75% of the Brazilian population. The remaining 25% of the population, covered by the
private sector, also has the right to access services provided by the SUS.

The constitution delineates the basic structure of SUS, prioritizing the preventive care
and emphasizing the regionalization of health services by transferring responsibilities to
states and cities.
It is believed that this decentralization makes local health systems
more attuned to the health needs of the population and enables the exercise of public
control over health policies. So, in the brazilian health system, the Federal government is
responsible for developing national public policies and ﬁnancially supporting states and
municipalities, which in turn are responsible for the execution of regulatory functions in
their respective spheres with considerable autonomy.

The private sector also plays an important role in the brazilian health system. The
country has the second-largest private insurance market by population in the world,
behind only the United States. A signiﬁcant share of Brazilian health plans are either
small or medium in size and operate via contractual arrangements, providing medical
care in private doctors’ oﬃces and hospitals. As in the United States, most private
health plans in the country are connected to employment The private healthcare market
is regulated by the National Health Agency (ANS), whose responsibility is to promote
public interest in private health insurance and regulate the operators in the industry.

Now we turn to how the degrees of physician and resident specialist are awarded in
Brazil. The Brazilian medical schools follow the European model of a six-year curriculum,
divided into three cycles of two years each (basic cycle, clinic cycle and internship cycle).
After six years of training, students graduate and are awarded the title of physician,

5

allowing them to register with the Regional Council of Medicine (CRM). The recent
graduate will be able to exercise the medical profession as a general practitioner and may
apply to undertake postgraduate training.

Physicians who want to join a residency program must undergo a new selection ex-
amination considered as competitive as that required to join a medical school. These
specialization programs are divided into two categories: direct access and prerequisite.
The specialties with direct access are those in which the doctor can enroll without having
any prior expertise. To apply to proprietary pre-requisite, the doctor should have already
completed a specialty prior, usually clinical or surgery residency. The programs may need
from 2 to 6 years of training. In Brazil, 53 residency programs are currently recognized
by the Federal Council of Medicine (CFM), the Brazilian Medical Association (AMA)
and the National Commission of Medical Residency (CNRM). The completion of these
programs gives the title of resident physician specialist. Around 60% of medical school
graduates does not have a residency specialization in Brazil.

Finally, it is important to discuss physician’s supply in Brazil. According to regis-
ters from the Federal Council of Medicine (CFM), in 2012, Brazil had 388.015 active
physicians, reaching the mark of two professionals per 1000 inhabitants. This considerate
escalation in the number of physicians, from 1.15 in 1980 to 2.0 in 2012, followed the
inauguration of several medical schools from 1965 onwards. Now the country is consid-
erably above the global ratio if 1.4 and near the 2.4 ratio of the United States, as stated
by the 2014 World Health Statistics. Together with this increase came a change in the
focus of public health policies in Brazil. Programs such as Provab and More Physicians
began to prioritize the maldistribution of these professionals across regions instead of
their shortage in general. As can be seem in Figure 1, Brazilian physicians are mainly
concentrated in metropolitan regions, specially in South and Southeast of the country,
instead of it’s outskirts and rural areas. In our study we investigate exactly what entails
such practice location decisions by physicians in a developing country.

2.2 Data and Summary Statistics

Next we describe the two main data sets, RAIS and CNRM, together with other sources
of information used in this study.

The primary data source is the Annual Report of Social Information (RAIS) from 2002
to 2010, maintained by the Ministry of Labor and Employment in Brazil. Currently,
it covers 95% of the formal sector in the country. The observation units are formal
establishments with detailed information about it’s employees. This database made it
possible to see in which city physicians with a formal link are working, as well as their
average wages, working hours, age, gender and race. Except for race, which had a lot of
missing values, these information were all used in this research from 2002 until 2010. It

6

is important to highlight that, although we know the cities physicians decided to work,
for computational and analytical reasons we chose to aggregate their decision unit into
metropolitan region and countryside of the ﬁve main Brazilian regions (South, North,
Northeast, Southeast and Midwest), amounting to ten possible choices. If a physician
worked in more than one region, we considered only the one with higher working hours.
The measure constructed for wages deserves a little more explanation. With informa-
tion provided by RAIS, we calculated the average wage per hour physicians earn in each
of the ten decision units. We used the salary per hour of the whole sample of physicians,
and not only of the ones with a residency specialization. So, in our model, while making
their decisions, individuals look at the average hourly wage physicians formally employed
earn in each region.
It is important to state that this measure does not account for
the full income of physicians. There are many oﬀ-book earnings associated with being
self-employed, like owning their own oﬃce or clinic.

Afterwards, we linked these registers with data from the National Commission of
Medical Residency (CNRM). This database provides information about the residency
programs every physician in the country completed. Through it, we have access to the
physician name, his social security number, the specialty chosen together with the be-
ginning and conclusion date of training. Since many physicians completed more than
one residency (the ﬁrst one usually being clinical medicine or surgery, both prerequisite
for other programs), we kept only the most recent one for analysis. Also, for analytical
reasons, we decided to aggregate the specialties into ﬁve major ﬁelds: surgery, clinic, pe-
diatrics, family medicine and obstetrics and gynaecology. Table 1 shows how physicians
are distributed among these areas. Finally, while merging the two databases, we lost
around 26,7% physicians from CNRM. We believe this loss is mainly due to mistakes in
the social security numbers and to self-employed physicians. As stated previously, RAIS
includes only formally employed workers.

From this joint dataset we can extract relevant information such as the high con-
centration of residency programs in the Southeast (Figure 2). Moreover, comparing the
choices of practice location done by recently graduated physicians with the region they
completed residency we see a strong positive relation (Figure 3). This indicates a ten-
dency for physicians to remain in the same region they completed residency.

Measures of education were obtained from the National Treasury, which provides
data of the expenditures made by each city in this sector. This variable was modiﬁed
to expenditure per capita. We also used the rates of infant mortality as a proxy for the
cities’ health system. This data is provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics (IBGE). The regions’ GDP per capita measure were also obtained from IBGE.
As a violence proxy, we used homicide rates provided by the SUS Database (DATASUS).
The proxy for living costs derived from data in RAIS and was constructed based on salary
earned by bus drivers in each region for 44 weekly working hours. We used bus drivers,

variables together with salary per hour are displayed in Table 2.

Our study will be latter improved with health infrastructure data for each region

since 2003 and are published monthly. Since it is very detailed, we intend to create seven
summary indices following Katz, Kling and Liebman (2007) methodology. The later
will be obtained from the Federal Council of Medicine (CFM), which has a database
containing all physician’s registers in Brazil.

3 Model and Empirical Strategy

This section describes the physician’s decision model, the general setup of the econometric
model and the identiﬁcation strategy.

3.1 Model of Practice Location

We assume physicians, right after ﬁnishing their residency program, maximize utility
over initial practice locations. The utility is a function of the physician’s socioeconomic
and training characteristics as well as of the alternative’s attributes. The utility physician
i receives from region j is:

Uij = Vij(wj, xj, ai) + ij

(1)

where
Vij is the representative utility,
wj is the expected hourly salary of physicians formaly employed in region j,
xj is the vector of amenities from region j,
ai is the vector of individual characteristics and
ij is the stochastic term.

The vector of amenities includes the region’s gdp, living costs, health system, vio-
lence index and investment in education. We also added alternative-speciﬁc constants
that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in regions that remain stable over time. In
the vector of individual characteristics we have age, gender, region where the physician
completed the residency program and the speciality chosen. To capture diﬀerent eﬀects
wages may have in countryside and urban areas, we added an interaction between salary
per hour and a dummy for metropolitan region. As for the random component of utility,
ij, it takes into account factors such as unobserved heterogeneity, unobserved attributes
of regions that vary over time and measurement errors. The assumption placed in its
distribution will determine the econometric model.

3.2 Multinomial Logit and Identiﬁcation

Now we describe the multinomial logit model used to estimate the parameters of
the utility function in (1) and the location-choice probabilities for each physician in the
population. We assume the utility function is linear in parameters, where β is a vector
containing them. This simpliﬁcation is reasonable since, under fairly general conditions,
any function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by one that is linear in parameters.
We also suppose errors follow a type 1 extreme value distribution, which will give some
desirable properties to the probabilities. They will necessarily be between zero and one

11

and the choice probabilities for all alternatives will sum to one.

Uij = Xijβ + ij

iid∼ extreme value

The physician’s choice is such that:

1

0,

yij =

if Uij ≥ Uik, ∀k ∈ {1, ..., J}
otherwise.

where yij indicates the observed choice made by the physician. The probability that he
chooses alternative j is given by:

Pij = P rob(Uij > Uik , ∀k (cid:54)= j)

= P rob(Vij + ij > Vik + ik, ∀k (cid:54)= j)
= P rob(ik < ij + Vij − Vik, ∀k (cid:54)= j)

After some algebraic manipulation of the integral, we get a succinct, closed-form expres-
sion:

eVij(cid:80)

k eVik

eXij β(cid:80)

k eXikβ

=

Pij =

which is the multinomial logit choice probability.

It is important to recall that only diﬀerences in utility matter for the speciﬁcation
and estimation of any discrete choice model.
If a constant is added to the utility of
all alternatives, the physician’s decision will not change. Also, the choice probability
depends only on the diﬀerence in utility, not its absolute level. Thus, only parameters
that capture diﬀerences across regions can be identiﬁed. Since region’s attributes vary
over alternatives, their identiﬁcation is straightforward.

However, the physicians’ characteristic also inﬂuence their decision and they do not
vary over the options. To account for this fact, we needed to normalize the social-
demographic parameters of one alternative. The alternative chosen for comparison was
the Southeast’s metropolitan region and we set it’s social-demographic parameters to
zero. The other parameters are interpreted as being relative to it. The same issue aﬀects
alternative-speciﬁc constants, included to capture the average eﬀect on utility of all factors
that are not included in the model. Therefore we normalized the absolute levels of these
constants and chose the same region for comparison.

12

Since the logit probabilities take a closed form, the traditional maximum-likelihood
methods can be used. Assuming that each physician decision is independent, the proba-
bility of each person in the sample choosing the alternative that he was observed actually
to choose is

L(β) =

(Pij)yij

I(cid:89)

(cid:89)

i=1

j

I(cid:88)

(cid:88)

where yij = 1 if the physician i chose region j and zero otherwise. The log-likelihood
function is then:

LL(β) =

yij ln Pij

i=1

j

and the estimator is the value of β that maximizes this function. At the maximum of the
loglikelihood function, its derivative with respect to each of the parameters is zero.

It is important to comment on the limitations of the multinomial logit speciﬁcation.
First, logit models can capture tastes that vary only with respect to observed variables.
Neither random taste variation nor preferences that vary with unobserved variables are
taken into account. Since the observable variables in our model do not capture the whole
spectrum of physician’s preferences, logit is not the ideal speciﬁcation. Also, this model
implies proportional substitution patterns across alternatives, a characteristic known as
independence of irrelevant variables. This assumption is not reasonable in our context
because it imposes zero correlation across regions. Physicians that choose a certain
region are more likely to prefer alternatives similar to it than completely diﬀerent ones.
Thus, IIA is not a reasonable assumption in our context and might lead to inconsistent
estimates.

To incorporate random taste variation appropriately and capture more ﬂexible sub-
stitution patterns, the ideal speciﬁcation is the multinomial mixed logit. This will be
exactly our empirical approach and contribution to the literature in latter developments
of this paper. But, before reﬁning our method, we intend to see in which direction a
discrete choice model approach is leading us with this simpler speciﬁcation. This will
give us a better understanding into how to take the next steps.

4 Results

In this section we discuss the results of our multinomial logit speciﬁcation of equation
2, presented in Tables 3, 4 and 5. The results and observations made in this section are
considered preliminary given our intention to later improve the model and data presented
here.

First, we will examine how personal characteristics aﬀect physicians decisions of prac-
tice location. Table 3 provides the coeﬃcients and standard deviation for region-speciﬁc
constants and individual attributes. Since these coeﬃcients do not vary over alternatives,
we normalized to zero the parameters corresponding to the Southeast metropolitan re-
gion. The other parameters should be interpreted relative to it. For example, being a
male physician raises de probability of choosing the Southeast countryside area instead
of its metropolitan region, since its coeﬃcient is positive and signiﬁcant at a 1% level
(0.334). We chose the Southeast metropolitan region for comparison, because it is the
most developed one in Brazil and most physicians are currently concentrated in it. Also,
S˜ao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro States belong to the this region.

Analysing the gender parameter we see that they are mainly positive and signiﬁcant
(at 1% and 5% level) for countryside regions, which means that being a male general
practitioner increases the probability of practising in these areas compared to the South-
east metropolitan region. Moreover, the large coeﬃcient associated with the Northeast
countryside, which is one of the poorest regions in the country, indicates that this eﬀect
is stronger for impoverished areas. Thus, female physicians are less likely to work outside
large urban center than male physicians. Concerning the eﬀect of age, all the coeﬃcients
are positive and highly signiﬁcant, which means that being older raise the probability
of working outside the Southeast metropolitan region. This eﬀect is stronger with the
countryside regions, indicating that older physicians are more likely to choose a rural or
smaller community. Regional dummies have been used to control for the eﬀect of regional
amenities varying across regions but remaining stable over time. These constants are all
negative and highly signiﬁcant.

As for the residency areas physicians completed, we can see that their coeﬃcients
follow an interesting, though not perfect, pattern. Physicians that completed pediatrics,
family medicine or gynaecology and obstetrics programs have a higher probability of
working in countryside regions than physicians that completed surgery programs. These
coeﬃcients tend to be positive and highly signiﬁcant. Moreover, having completed resi-
dency programs in one of these three areas reduces the probability of working in urban
centers other than the Southeast metropolitan region. These results are consistent with
the fact that these specialties are related to primary care, which is more needed in remote
and rural areas. It doesn’t need as much a good infrastructure as surgery practices. Also,
physicians that chose these programs have probably a higher preference for working in
needy places.

We now analyse the results for alternative-speciﬁc variables displayed in Table 4.
They exploit the eﬀects of regional amenities in physician’s choice. The coeﬃcient for
education expenditure of municipalities is positive and signiﬁcant at a 10% level, signalling
the importance of regional schooling in their choice. However, this parameter is small
probably because part of its eﬀect is being captured by the region-speciﬁc constants. The

quality of the education system in Brazil has remained relatively stable between 2002-
2010. As for the infant mortality rate, it’s coeﬃcient is highly negative and signiﬁcant
at a 1% level. This indicates that economic and social conditions for the health of
mothers and newborns, as well as the eﬀectiveness of health systems are taken into
consideration by physicians. Also, our living costs proxy is negative and signiﬁcant at
10% level suggesting that this factor is taken into consideration by physicians. The reason
for the small estimate might also be the inclusion of alternative-speciﬁc constants.

The GDP per capita is the core indicator of the regions’ standard of living and eco-
nomic performance. In our results this variable is positive but not signiﬁcant. This might
be due to high correlation with other variables, such as education, infant mortality and
the regional-speciﬁc dummies. On the other hand, the homicides rate is signiﬁcant at a
5% level and positive, which is counterintuitive. This probably indicates an endogeneity
problem caused by omitted variables, which we intend to correct by introducing new
amenities inputs, such as region’s health infrastructure and entertainment quality.

As for the salary per hour variable and it’s interaction with a metropolitan region

15

dummy, we obtain an intriguing result. Both have a positive, though small, coeﬃcient.
However, the former is not signiﬁcant and the later is at a %1 level. This indicates that
salaries in metropolitan regions are important for physicians that recently completed
residency, but not salaries in the countryside. We ﬁrst thought this might be due to
salaries in rural and remote areas coming mainly from public health establishments and
being therefore more regulated and with a smaller variance. Yet, their variance is mostly
greater than salaries in metropolitan regions, as can be seem in the summary statistics
of Table 2. Another reasonable explanation could be that this result, together with the
low coeﬃcient values, is related to the usual endogeneity problem of supply and demand
models. We will address this point in the next step of this work through an instrumental
variable.

However, it could be that wages are not a key determinant in the decision of physicians
who decide to work in rural ans remote areas. Other factors, such as health infrastructure
and life quality, might be much more crucial in their decision that obfuscates the inﬂuence
salaries usually have. Unlike developed countries, where most cities in the outskirts of
large urban regions have the essential infrastructure to attend well its citizens, Brazil’s
remote areas are usually very poor and lack basic infrastructure and a good education
and health system. This is the argument used by many physicians in the country, who
claim that better salaries are not as crucial as better work and life conditions in these
regions. Hence, our results, tough preliminary, could be pointing in this direction. If this
is so, public policies that oﬀer better wages for physicians in remote areas are not very
eﬀective in developing countries. Our next step is exactly to incorporate better measures
of infrastructure from CNES to directly assess these dimensions.

Finally, lets examine the dummies for residency region. Although they relate to
individual attributes, we constructed these variables in a manner similar to the dummy
that indicates which region a physician chose. This way they vary through alternatives
and their coeﬃcients can be identiﬁed without a normalization. That is why we included
their results in Table 5, a separate one. We built a dummy for each region in order to
capture if completing residency in diﬀerent regions retain physicians diﬀerently.

The parameters associated with these dummies are all positive and highly signiﬁcant
(1% level) providing evidence that recently post-graduated physicians have strong in-
centives to remain in the same region they completed residency. This might be due to
attachments developed during the training period and to connections made that facil-
itate the process of ﬁnding a job. This result is of high value for policy-makers, who
could encourage the opening of more residency programs in the countryside to retain this
workforce. Also, we can see that post-graduate programs in metropolitan regions usually
have a larger power in retaining physicians than countryside communities.

It is interesting to point the high value associated with the North countryside and
metropolitan regions. A possible explanation is the opening of many new residency

programs in this region between 2006 and 2010. The North region is traditionally the
one with least residency programs in the country. Roraima, for example, opened its ﬁrst
post-graduation in 2006 and Tocantins had its ﬁrst residency class graduating in 2013.
The North also has 1.1 physcians per 1000 people, the lowest ratio in the country. The
combined eﬀect of new residency programs in a region with few of them and of a large
physician shortage might explain the strengthened eﬀect the North dummies presented
(5.255 and 5.902 with 1% signiﬁcance).

The model’s predictive power can be assessed in Table 5, which compares the pre-
dictions with the observed outcome. The predictions are obtained by assuming each
physician chooses the region that has the highest predicted probability. Overall, the ﬁt is
relatively good, with a proportion of total observations correctly predicted of 78.70%. The
model slightly overpredicts the choices of Southeast, South and Northeast metropolitan
regions and of the Southeast countryside, all high-frequency alternatives. Nonetheless,
their relative high proportion of correctly predicted choices (column 4) are only marginally
due to overprediction. As column 5 reveals for these four regions, 83.3%, 76.52%, 78.79%
and 63.77% of the predictions are actually correct. The North and Midwest metropolitan
regions also presents a good degree of agreement between the predicted and actually cho-
sen regions. However, the South, North and Northeast countrysides correctly predicted
rates are considerably lower and the choice of Midwest countryside region by physicians
couldn’t be predicted at all by our model. The contrast in the predictive power of our
model between rural and metropolitan regions indicates there are factors inﬂuencing
physicians decision to work in remote areas that are not being captured. We believe this
will be mainly improved when we incorporate health infrastructure indexes in our model.

5 Conclusion

In this work, we presented a discrete choice model based on a multinomial logit
speciﬁcation that assess the physician’s ﬁrst choice of practice location in developing
countries. Our aim is to better understand which factors are central in their decision
process in order to guide public policies used to inﬂuence their geographical distribution.
One of our main ﬁndings was how the place where physicians’ ﬁnished their residency
program seems to deeply inﬂuences their decision of practice location. The variables
presented a high positive value with a 1% signiﬁcancy level indicating that this is highly
taken into consideration by them. This is probably related to attachments built during
the training period and to professionals connections, essential in the beginning of their
careers. Also, we found that physicians who completed a residency in pediatrics, family
medicine and gynaecology and obstetrics appear to be more inclined to work in country-
side regions, where primary care is the health system focus. This is most likely because
people that choose this specialities have a higher preference for working in needy regions.
Therefore, these preliminary results indicate that opening more residency programs re-
lated to primary care in underserved areas might increase the physicians supply in these

19

regions.

Second, there is the intriguing result concerning physicians wages. They appear to
be relevant in metropolitan regions but not in the countryside. This might be due to
endogeneity and speciﬁcations problems which we intend to assess in the next steps
of our work through the use of a mixed logit speciﬁcation and the introduction of an
instrumental variable for salary. However, this could also be related to the complaint
made by many health professionals in developing countries. They declare the main reason
for not wanting to work in remote communities is not its wages, but the precariousness
of work conditions and its low life quality. We also intend to further investigate this
possibility by adding new explanatory variables, such as health infrastructure and an
entertainment proxy.
If the latter possibility proves itself right in our reﬁned model,
the government should prioritize the provision of essential infrastructure to its citizens
instead of higher salaries in underserved communities.

Finally, we would like to comment on two other extensions we intend to implement
next. First, we intend to not only model physicians‘ ﬁrst practice location decisions, but
also their dynamic over time. This way we can assess how long they stay in a region
along with which factors, such as work experience, might be responsible for changes.
Understanding this dynamic is important since public policies should not only aim at
increasing contemporaneous supply of health professionals in needy regions, but also
encourage them to stay.

Second, we will incorporate general practitioners in our approach. These physicians
did not complete a residency program and are usually oriented to primary care, the
focus of remote and rural regions health system. Underserved areas are in more need of
basic health care than of a specialized one, which emphasizes the importance of including
general practitioner in our study. We intend to do it through the Federal Council of
Medicine (CFM) database. It has the name of all physicians in Brazil, their city of birth,
the medicine school completed and date of conclusion.
