in  2014-16;  and  an  analysis 

 
Abstract:  Motivations  that  may  be  understood  only  through  the  lenses  of  Political 
Economy induce many analysts to the prognostic of an imminent economic crisis in 
China.  In  this  framework,  several  authors  claimed  the  occurrence  of  an  important 
capital  flight  in  China  in  2014-16.  This  paper  aims  therefore  to  answer:  did  China 
really undergo a Capital flight? Its methodology includes an analysis of the Chinese 
external  stocks  and  flows 
that  goes  beyond 
macroeconomics, looking also to the currency hierarchy and the international usage of 
the renminbi (RMB). We conclude: i) the fall in the foreign reserves in China in 2015-
16  was  partially  due  to  a  strategy  of  the  Chinese  government  to  diversify  its 
international assets (due to economic and political reasons); ii) there has occurred a 
capital flight in China in 2015-16, but these outflows were mostly in RMB. Due to 
that core difference, the effects over the domestic economy are much lower. Further, 
it  may  contribute  to  the  internationalization  of  the  RMB,  strategic  quest  of  the 
Chinese government that will have important economic and geopolitical implications.

Resumo:  Motivações  que  só  podem  ser  compreendidas  pelas  lentes  da  Economia 
Política  induzem  muitos  analistas  ao  recorrente  prognóstico  de  que  uma  crise 
econômica na China é iminente. Nesse ínterim, diversos autores alegaram que estaria 
ocorrendo  uma  importante  fuga  de  capitais  na  China  no  período  2014-16.  Para 
contribuir com esse debate, o objetivo deste artigo é responder à pergunta: a China 
realmente  passou  por  uma  fuga  de  capitais  no  período  em  tela?  A  metodologia  da 
pesquisa inclui uma ampla análise dos estoques e fluxos externos chineses entre 2014 
e 2016; e uma análise que transcende a macroeconomia e procura avaliar a hierarquia 
monetária e o crescente uso internacional do renminbi (RMB). Concluímos que: i) a 
queda  das  reservas  internacionais  na  China  em  2015-16  deveu-se,  em  parte,  à 
estratégia  do  governo  chinês  de  –  por  motivos  econômicos  e  geopolíticos  – 
diversificar seus ativos externos; ii) ocorreu uma fuga de capitais na China em 2015-
16, mas essas saídas de recursos foram principalmente em RMB. Dada essa diferença 
crucial  em  relação  ao  que  usualmente  ocorre  nos  momentos  de  fuga  de  capital,  os 
efeitos  sobre  a  economia  doméstica  são  muito  menores.  Além  disso,  esse  processo 
pode contribuir para a internacionalização do RMB, objetivo almejado pelo governo 
chinês e que terá implicações econômicas e geopolíticas importantes sobre o globo.

1) Introduction  

Chinese economic performance in the last 40 years is completely astonishing. 
During  this  period,  the  average  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  growth  was  almost 
10% per year. China is already the second largest economy in the world – the first one 
if we consider the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) – and the most important nation in 
the world for international trade. 

Yet,  this  impressive  trajectory  created  some  imbalances  in  the  Chinese 
economy. As a matter of fact, while the annual income per capita in the Eastern part 
of China surpassed 28 thousand yuan in 2016, western China accounted for only 16 
thousand yuan (NBOC, 2016). However, even regional inequality has been on the rise 
and  China  has  currently  one  of  the  highest  GINI  coefficients  of  the  world  (Zhang, 
2016). 

From  the  macroeconomic  point  of  view,  it  is  important  to  notice  that 
consumption still has a low contribution on economic growth. In the last decades, the 
high  economic  dynamism  has  been  determined  mostly  by  exports  and  investments. 
However, the global financial crisis that broke out in 2008 accelerated the will of the 
Chinese government to reinforce a process of endogeneization of economic growth. In 
order to avoid the effects of the global crisis, some anti-cyclical policies have been 
implemented in 2009-10, resulting in very high rates of investment. These programs 
have been successful in curbing the deceleration of economic growth, but they may 
create  some  profound  problems  related  to  overinvestment  and  the  deterioration  of 
capital  returns.  In  other  words,  after  such  a  long  period  of  economic  growth,  the 
probability  of  an  investment  to  be  either  redundant  or  not  profitable  is  now  higher 
(Krober, 2016). 

Other authors point out to the over indebtedness of the Chinese economy, and 
its  possible  negative  consequences  to  the  financial  system.  China’s  non-financial 
corporation  credit-to-GDP  ratio  grew  from  135%  in  the  pre-crisis  to  200%  in  2012 
(Mackenzie,  2013).  Also  keeping  in  mind  the  low  return  of  projects,  some  authors 
have questioned the soundness of the Chinese financial system (e.g. Chen and Kang, 
2018). Nonetheless, this is not a consensus, since other experts highlight the fact that 
most  of  this  debt  is  denominated  in  local  currency  and  the  capacity  of  Chinese 
government to recapitalize its public banks (e.g. Lardy, 2016). 

After  all,  in  spite  of  the  impressive  performance  of  the  Chinese  economy 
highlighted  above,  some  analysts  suggest  the  country  is  facing  the  risk  of  a  huge 
crisis. The two most common “potential crises” indicated by such literature are: i) a 
demand crisis related to the overcapacity of the industrial sector; ii) a financial crisis. 
Concerning the first possibility, it is true that China has currently high idle capacity in 
many sectors, specially amplified by the abovementioned anti-cyclical policies held in 
2009-104. Nevertheless, one should not forget the ability of the Chinese government 
to foster demand. Regarding the second possibility, it is also important to notice that a 
public bank system tends to be much more resilient than a private one. 

Beyond these prognostics stating that China will face a huge crisis in the near 
future, there has also been many authors and market practitioners claiming that in the 
last  few  years  Chinese  economy  is  already  facing  a  potentially  important  problem: 
capital flight (e.g. Gunter, 2017; Bloomberg, 2016, The Economist, 2015, Kärnfelt, 
2017).  Even  Chinese  authorities  tried  to  calm  market  sentiments,  when  the  deputy 
director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, Wang Xiaoyu, emphasized

in a press conference that the capital outflows that occurred in 2015 were not caused 
by “panic” and could not be considered a capital flight (Chen, 2015). 

There has been indeed a massive decline in their international reserves in the 
last three years, but it is still curious to talk about a capital flight in a country that has 
international reserves of more than US$ 3 trillion. Why is this capital running away? 

Because  of  the  exchange  rate  risk?  Of  course,  it  is  rather  a  consensus  that 
Chinese  renminbi  (henceforth  RMB)  is  artificially  undervalued,  so  if  the  exchange 
rate has any long term trend it is probably going in the direction of an appreciation, 
increasing the gains of its holders; it is true that in the recent period there had been 
some devaluation, but the volatility of the exchange rate in China is still very low, so 
for  speculative  gains 
in  other 
currencies/markets.  

it  would  be  more  reasonable 

to  operate 

Because  of  Political  risk?  This  hardly  looks  like  an  answer  for  even  if  it 
happens  in  a  really  gradual  pace,  China  keeps  the  movement  of  opening-up  its 
economy. Thus, in order to understand this supposed capital flight, more research is 
required. 

This paper claims that analyses which only take into account the variation of 
international reserves may be deceptive. There are at least two very important (and 
related) movements that are underneath and have to be considered as well: i) a change 
in 
the 
internationalization of the Chinese renminbi (RMB). Although this may not tell the 
whole  story,  it  does  help  to  elucidate  concerns  over  the  so-called  capital  flights  in 
China  

the  composition  of  Chinese  external  stocks; 

the  efforts 

This paper aims therefore to answer the question: did China really undergo a 
Capital flight between 2014 and 2016? In order to answer this question we have to go 
beyond  the  mere  analysis  of  the  reserves.  For  this  reason,  the  methodology  of  this 
paper includes a broader analysis of the Chinese external stocks and flows between 
December/2014-December/2016, combined with an analysis of the international usage 
of the Chinese RMB. Our research resources consist in databases and reports from the 
People’s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange – some of 
them exclusively published in Mandarin. 

Besides this Introduction, the paper has four more sections. The second one 
presents  some  brief  discussions  regarding  capital  flights;  the  third  one  makes  an 
analysis of the Chinese external flows and stocks in the period 2014-2016; the fourth 
one discusses the International Monetary System (IMS) hierarchy and the usage of the 
RMB; concluding the paper, we present some final remarks.

2. Capital flights: some brief discussions 
 

First of all, it is important to discuss the definition of capital flight, since the 
diverse uses of this concept may cause misunderstandings. In some contexts, capital 
flight  is  related  to  the  illicit  operations  to  take  resources  away  from  a  country.  It 
happens  when  travellers  do  not  declare  the  money  they  are  transporting  from  a 
country, but also through fraudulent financial operations 

Kar  &  Freitas  (2012)  points  that  this  sort  of  capital  flight  may  provoke 
economic problems to the remitter country. For instance, they may result in a lack of 
international currency, which engenders an unnecessary growth in a country's foreign 
debt or even undermines the tax base. In this sense “illicit inflows do not provide a 
benefit that offsets the initial loss of capital through outflows, as they cannot be taxed 

	  

3	  

or  used  to  boost  productive  capacity  […]  more  likely  to  drive  the  underground 
economy than be invested in the official economy” (Kar & LeBlanc, 2013, p. 3). 

Nevertheless,  this  is  not  the  kind  of  capital  flight  that  is  important  for  this 
paper5.  The  capital  flight  we  are  dealing  with  here  is  not  at  all  a  crime,  since  it 
constitutes  a  capital  exit  through  the  institutional  and  legal  channels.  In  this  sense, 
when an individual household or enterprise takes money out of the country, it does not 
constitute  in  a  problem.  It  becomes  one  when  this  withdraw  movement  is  done  by 
many  households  and  enterprises  at  the  same  time,  that  is,  when  it  constitutes  a 
collective action and therefore a sudden and massive volume of outflows6. It may be 
measured by the difference between the international inflows and outflows, that is, the 
net capital outflows. 

Dornbusch (1990) suggests that a capital flight occurs when economic agents 
fear  having  losses  related  to  an  investment  made  in  a  certain  country,  as  a 
consequence of political risk, financial repression, expected changes in the exchange 
rate  or  for  tax  considerations.  In  a  similar  manner,  Gunter  (2008)  considers  capital 
flight an outflow of resources from a country driven by an adversative alteration in the 
country's political, economic, or social situation. Both authors state therefore that the 
responsibility for the capital flights is related to the country that suffers it (any kind of 
“bad policy”).  

However, this point of view is not at all a consensus. With a different view, 
many authors say that the determination of the capital flows are more related to the 
international  liquidity  cycles  than  to  domestic  reasons  (Ocampo,  2001;  Flassbeck, 
2002; Rey, 2015). It is true that sometimes the massive outflows may be related to 
domestic problems – either economic or political –, but empirical analyses show that 
in many circumstances the reversal of the capitals movements from inflow to outflow 
in peripheral countries may be rather related to changes in the monetary policy in the 
central countries (e.g. in the United States).   

Whatever its cause, Epstein (2005) asserts that a capital flight is related to the 
transfer  of  assets  out  of  a  country  to  escape  ownership  claims,  as  well  as  losses  in 
returns or even in part of the principal. And the important point is that capital flights 
can  have  significant  economic  and  social  costs  –  mainly  in  peripheral  countries  –, 
since they may create a lack of US dollars and/or exchange rate crises. According to 
Epstein (op. cit.), these costs may include sacrificed investments in infrastructure, in 
human capital, in social services and on new plants and equipments. The author states 
that  rather  than  curbing  capital  flight,  financial  liberalization  tends  to  exacerbate  it. 
Given  the  severe  social  costs  and  dislocations  inflicted  by  capital  flight  upon  the 
developing world, he suggests the adoption of capital controls. 

When it comes to China, the subject of capital flight is not new. Sicular (1998) 
wanted  to  investigate  why  China  was  at  the  same  time  facing  expressive  sums  of 
inward  foreign  capital  investment  and  outward  capital  flight,  and  one  of  his  main 
explanations  was  the  different  treatment  experienced  by  foreign  and  domestic 
investors.  Kar  &  Freitas  (2012)  points  that  there  has  been  an  increasing  income 
inequality after the liberalization of the Chinese economy in the late 1970s and the 
richest people are moving the wealth abroad. 

Gunter (2017) estimates that the capital flight from China since 1984 was US$ 
3.2 trillion – i.e., nearly US$ 105 billion a year – and the pace has accelerated since 
2005, reaching US$ 425 billion in 2014. According to the author, the favoured routes 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
5 We are not saying that this kind of capital flight does not exist in China, but only that this is not the 
issue we are investigating here.

of  these  flights  have  changed  during  the  analysed  period.  From  1984  to  1999,  the 
financial transactions were very important. In 1999 some capital controls have been 
imposed, as a result capital flight through trade mis-invoicing - non-declaration of part 
of the value of exports - were predominant during the following decade. From 2012 
onwards,  the  capital  flight  route  was  increasingly  done  by  private  foreign  banks 
borrowing  from  Chinese  organizations  and  individuals.  The  author  claims  therefore 
that  capital  controls  appear  to  have  influence  only  in  the  preferred  route  of  capital 
flight,  leaving  other  possible  routes  open.  According  to  him,  the  motivations  for 
capital  flights  changed  over  time,  varying  from  a  search  for  lower  investment 
transaction  costs  in  China  to  the  migration  of  the  upper  class  and,  finally,  to  the 
surpassing of the anti-corruption campaign. 

The concept of capital flight adopted in this paper is not merely an outflow of 
financial resources as in Gunter (2017), Sicular (1998) and Kar & Freitas (2012). The 
capital flight being investigated here is a massive and sudden withdrawal of financial 
resources through legal channels. 

In general, the abovementioned authors identified two types of capital flights 
occurring  in  China.  The  first  one  is  a  long-term  tendency  of  illegal  transactions  to 
withdraw money from the country (as in Gunter, 2017; and Prasad, 2017). Despite the 
importance of this kind of operations, in this article we are concern with the second 
type,  that  is  the  supposed  massive  pull  out  of  capital  between  2014  and  2016. 
According to some analysis, the sharp decrease of Chinese foreign reserves (around 
US$ 1 trillion) is a thermometer of a critical capital flight problem7. Despite of the 
severe reduction of foreign reserves, China still has more than US$ 3 trillion. 

After  this  brief  presentation  of  how  different  authors  discuss  the  issue  of 
capital flights, the next section presents an analysis of the international reserves and 
the other external flows and stocks in China in the recent period. 

3. Chinese external flows and stocks (2014-2016)  

 
Numerous articles – either academic ones or in the media – have pointed to the 
occurrence  of  a  supposed  capital  flight  in  China  in  the  recent  period  (Bloomberg, 
2016;  The  Economist,  2015;  Kärnfelt,  2017).  According  to  them,  the  decrease  in 
foreign  reserves  was  not  entirely  the  result  of  capital  flight  (they  also  account  for 
devaluation  of  assets),  yet,  some  analysts  affirm  that  at  least  half  of  the 
aforementioned  contraction  was  provoked  by  capital  flight.  The  large  decline  in 
China's international reserves deserves attention because it constitutes a reversal in the 
strong upward trend that was going on since the 1990s. Figure 1 reveals that after ten 
years of increasing, Chinese international reserves reached the impressive amount of 
almost US$ 4 trillion in 2014. This apex was followed by a quick decline and, two 
years later, this amount had been reduced by almost US$ 1 trillion.

They mention that part of the reserve reduction also accounts for losses due to exchange rate variation.

US$ trillions (End of the year)

Although Chinese reserves still stand as the world's biggest (around 30% of 
world’s  total  international  reserves)  and  the  current  level  is  still  very  high  (around 
US$ 3 trillion), the recent and significant reduction in its size requires more analyses 
to understand its nature and whether this phenomenon constituted a capital flight or 
not. 

Firstly,  it  is  important  to  grasp  how  Chinese  reserves  are  allocated  and 
managed.  According  to  the  Peoples’  Bank  of  China  (PBOC),  by  December  2016 
foreign reserves accounted for US$ 3 trillion, among which 97% were securities held 
by central banks or government agencies. Although China does not report the detailed 
composition  of  its  foreign  reserves,  it  is  estimated  that  more  than  two-thirds  of  the 
amount  are  dollar-denominated  assets  (Wildau,  2014).  The  State  Administration  of 
Foreign Reserves (SAFE), under the administration of the PBOC, is responsible for 
managing these reserves.  

As Feng (2007) points, the Chinese authorities used to give priority to a liquid 
position then to asset profitability. Nonetheless, there was never a consensus on how 
to  best  manage  Chinese  foreign  reserves.  Many  scholars  and  Chinese  authorities 
called  attention  to  the  risks  and  costs  of  having  such  large  and  dollar  dependent 
foreign  reserves.  In  fact,  China  pays  a  very  high  premium  for  choosing  a  liquid 
position. Firstly, the accumulation of reserves may result in enormous increases of the 
means of payment in Chinese economy. In order to accommodate it, the PBOC needs 
to sterilise this excess liquidity. By 2010, the PBOC had sold 20 trillion yuan in bonds 
in exchange for its foreign reserves (Feng, 2011).  

Hauang  &  Tang  (2017)  show  that  China’s  foreign  reserves  had  a  smaller 
return then Direct Investments all over the period of 2005-15. According to their data, 
nominal  returns  on  reserves  were  normally  near  to  0%  whilst  the  direct  investment 
incomes reached at least 5.0% per year in most years. Unquestionably, this constitutes 
a good reason for the diversification on China’s external assets and the decrease in the 
amount  of  reserves.  Finally,  Xin  Wang  (2007)  already  highlighted  the  danger  of 
capital losses in case the RMB appreciated against core currencies.  It is not by chance 
that there is a lasting pressure over the PBOC and the SAFE to push them to a more 
efficient way of operating foreign reserves (Feng, 2011). 

According  to  SAFE  (2015),  in  2014  external  liabilities  income  payments 
totalled  US$  242.9  billion  and  external  assets  income  receipts  totalled  US$  183.1 

	  

6	  

billion; the net investment income of the BOP recorded therefore a deficit of US$ 59.9 
billion.  These  happened  despite  the  fact  that  China  has  a  net  positive  international 
investment  position  –  i.e.  external  assets  are  larger  than  external  liabilities.  These 
results occurred because the assets yield rates are persistently lower than the liabilities 
yield rates (SAFE, 2015, p 53). If China wants to have better results in the investment 
income  it  would  be  necessary  to  increase  the  diversification  in  its  assets  to  ensure 
higher yields.  

More recently, the incentives for changing the management of foreign reserves 
became  clearer.  In  the  magazine  Qiushi,  which  is  the  Communist  Party  main 
Theoretical journal, the Vice President of the People's Bank of China and Director of 
the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, Gongsheng Pan, emphasized that the 
foreign reserves should serve the country’s opening-up strategy such as the Belt and 
Road  and  Going  Global  initiatives  (Pan,  2017).  Further,  the  Director  also  affirmed 
that  China’s  reserves  should  serve  investments  in  the  real  economy,  and  help 
economic  growth.  This  calls  the  attention  to  one  more  reason  to  China  change  the 
composition of its foreign assets:  the realization of some specific investment project.  
Myers,  Gallagher  and  Yuan  (2016)  analyse  the  investments  of  the  Belt  and  Road 
initiative, which intends to enable an extensive infrastructure development throughout 
Eurasia;  for  this  purpose,  the  authors  show  that  in  2015  China  used  its  foreign 
exchange reserves in a domestic sovereign wealth fund and a policy bank. This can 
explain part of the decrease in Chinese reserve assets. 

To  advance  in  the  analysis,  it  is  important  to  have  in  mind  that  the  foreign 
exchange  market  in  China  is  kept  under  a  tight  control  by  monetary  authorities. 
According to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE, 2015), China’s 
balance  of  payments  (BOP)  was  projected  to  maintain  a  two-way  fluctuation 
(surpluses and deficits) in the capital and financial account and a surplus in the current 
account.  SAFE  is  therefore  making  some  adaptations  to  what  they  name  “the  new 
normal”  of  BOP.  In  this  sense,  they  declare  they  would  actively  promote  foreign 
exchange  market  development  and  trade  and  investment  facilitation,  construct  an 
external debt and capital flow management system in the context of macro prudential 
management,  promote  key  reforms  for  capital  account  convertibility,  and  improve 
foreign  reserve  management  with  the  aim  of  guarding  the  economy  against  shocks 
from cross-border capital flows. 

Still according to Gongsheng Pan, China has a strategy of foreign exchange 
holders’ diversification. According to him, the changes in the Chinese foreign assets 
was actually a process of “allocating foreign exchange to people” (cang hui yu ming), 
in  order  to  fulfill  the  residents  demand  for  outside  investments  or  their  need  for 
paying foreign debts (Pan, 2017).  

In this sense, it is clear that SAFE was worried about improving the foreign 
reserve  management.  It  is  possible  to  find  more  evidence  in  the  reports  of  this 
institution. We can see this evidence in three passages of its reports. In the first one: 

 
Meanwhile,  as  the  world’s  largest  consumption  market  and  with  the 
implementation  of  the  reforms  and  the  opening-up  of  the  domestic 
financial  markets,  China  will  continue  to  invite  foreign  capital  flows, 
especially  long-term  foreign  capital  inflows.  Finally,  with  adequate 
foreign  exchange  reserves,  China  is  sufficiently  strong  to  withstand 
external shocks. (SAFE, 2015, p. 71/72; our emphasis).

Even  if  it  is  not  very  explicit  the  meaning  of  adequate  foreign  exchange 
reserves, in our article we assume that Chinese institutions have deliberately chosen 
to diversify the country's external assets8 (as the aforementioned strategy of canghui 
yumin reveals)  and  also  to  reduce  the  level  of  international  reserves.  Regarding  the 
reduction of the reserves, in 2011 the President of the Peoples Bank of China Zhou 
Xiaochuan  affirmed  that  the  Chinese  international  reserves  were  in  fact  too  much 
(Feng, 2011) 

The  Chinese  authorities  highlight  the  opening-up  process  of  the  domestic 
financial  markets,  arguing  that  this  would  allow  the  country  to  continue  attracting 
long-term capital inflows, but the aim is to maintain an adequate level of reserves, 
even without explaining what this means exactly. In the second passage, these aims 
are more evident: 

(…)  Third,  transforming  administration,  accelerating  the  construction  of 
macro-prudential-related external debts and capital flow management, and 
improving policy reserves and response plans (…); and fifth, adhering to 
the target of serving the overall situation, promoting the innovative use of 
foreign  exchange  reserve  assets,  and  improving  foreign  exchange 
reserve management (SAFE, 2015, p. 75/76; our emphasis). 
 

In  the  next  year’s  report,  SAFE  was  more  explicit,  by  stating  that  it  is 

concerned about: 

Optimizing  diversified  use  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  to  serve 
national  strategies.  The  SAFE  enhanced  coordination  and  adhered  to 
market-oriented operations through equity, bonds and funds. In discharging 
its  responsibilities  as  an  investor,  the  SAFE  focused  on  supporting  the 
"Belt and Road" Initiative and international industrial capacity cooperation 
to  serve  enterprises  going  global  and  promote  economic  prosperity  and 
social development in China.(SAFE, 2016, p. 71; our emphasis). 
 

In  order  to  contribute  to  this  diversification  process,  there  has  been  also  a 
transfer of funds to the Chinese Sovereign Funds and to some bilateral or multilateral 
funds (Teixeira, 2018). According to the Sovereign Funds Wealth Institute, the four 
most  important  Chinese  Sovereign  Funds  accumulate  since  2016  more  than  US$  2 
trillions. The biggest one is the China Investment Corporation (CIC), administrated by 
the Ministry of Finance, whose total assets have increased from US$ 652.7 billions in 
2013 to US$ 813.5 billions in 20169. Aglietta (2013) states that:  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
8 “Changing external assets reflected the strategy of encouraging foreign exchange held by the private 
sector” (SAFE, 2015, p. 49). By the end of 2014, outstanding international reserve assets totaled USD 
3899.3  billion,  which  was  still  the  largest  component  of  the  external  assets  and  accounted  for  61 
percent of the total external assets, 4 percentage points lower than the ratio in 2013 and a historical low 
since 2004. The private sector accelerated its going-out investment. It preferred traditional investment 
due to its preference for low risks. Outward direct investments and other investments, such as loans and 
deposits,  amounted  to  USD  2246.9  billion,  accounting  for  35  percent  of  total  external  assets,  which 
represented  a  historical  high.  Outward  portfolio  investment  assets  totaled  USD  262.5  billion, 
accounting  for  4  percent  of  total  external  assets,  0.2  percentage  point  lower  than  the  ratio  in  2013” 
(SAFE, 2015, p. P49/50). 
9 CIC  was  created  in  2007  with  US$  200  billions  and  the  following  mission:  “CIC  is  committed  in 
diversifying  China’s  foreign  exchanges  and  seeking  maximum  returns  for  its  shareholder  within 
acceptable  risk  tolerance”  (CIC,  2013).  From  its  creation  to  2016,  CIC’s  portfolio  annual  average 
return  was  4.76%  (CIC,  2016),  much  higher  than  that  of  the  international  reserves  administrated  by 
SAFE.  

	  

8	  

China  Investment  Corporation  (CIC)  get  their  resources  from  excess  FX 
reserves. The stabilization function of the currency is done by the SAFE 
(foreign exchange department of The Peoples Bank of China). CIC has the 
mission  to  invest  mainly  abroad  and  to  take  risk  in  order  to  get  higher 
return than a stabilization fund. 

In sum, to understand this change in strategy, it is important to highlight the 
reasons  why  the  Chinese  authorities  want  to  seek  diversification  of  their  external 
assets:  i)  the  realization  of  some  specific  investment  projects  (such  as  going  global 
and  Belt  and  Road  initiative);  ii)  the  increase  in  the  profitability  of  the  country's 
foreign  asset,  given  the  low  profitability  of  international  reserves;  iii)  the  net 
investment income recorded a structural deficit – this is intrinsically related to item ii. 
Beyond these reasons discussed above, in this article we argue that we need to take 
into consideration one more reason: iv) the attempt to internationalize the renminbi, 
an aspect that will be elaborated in the next section. 
At this point, it is probably already clear that in this research the focus should 
 
not be on the mere analysis of these reserves. The methodology of the paper includes 
a broader analysis of the Chinese external stocks and flows, comparing their evolution 
between December/2014 and December/2016. 

Some results are shown in Table 1. First of all, the external stocks in China’s 
International  Investment  Position  indicate  that  the  country’s  international  reserves 
have  been  reduced  in  US$  801  billion  from  December  2014  to  December  2016. 
However,  other  Chinese  external  assets  had  a  different  trend:  Outward  Direct 
Investments  (ODI)  increased  US$  435  billion,  Portfolio  Investments  increased  US$ 
103  billion  and  Other  Investments  abroad  increased  US$  287  billion.  It  means  that 
this fall in reserves was more than offset, since these other external assets increased 
US$ 824 billion in the same period. This allows us to think of the occurrence of a 
mere change in the composition of Chinese foreign assets10. As a matter of fact, the 
total external assets are quite similar in the beginning and in the end of the time series 
(around US$ 6.4 trillion).

10 One may obviously not say that this change in the composition of the external assets is totally due to 
a strategy of the Chinese government – since they reflect also private decisions motivated by a quest 
for yield –, but we may at least state that it has not been contradictory to these governmental strategies. 

	  

9	  

This partial analysis that initially looks only to the external assets allows us to 

say therefore that the statement of Prasad (2014, p. 257) is still valid: 

 

Although gross capital outflows from China have increased significantly, 
they  are  consistent  with  the  government’s  steps  to  liberalize  outflows. 
Nongovernment  outflows  are  likely  to  increase  further  as  Chinese 
corporations  look  for  investment  opportunities  abroad  and  as  financial 
market  development  allows  households  to  take  advantage  of  avenues  to 
diversify their savings into foreign investments. There is little reason (so 
far) to panic about China’s rising capital outflows – they may be a sign of a 
maturing economy rather than a troubled one. 
 

Turning  the  focus  to  the  external  liabilities  in  Table  1,  Foreign  Direct 
Investment (FDI) rose US$ 267 billion in the period, which suggests that China made 
more  Outward  Direct  Investment  than  it  received  as  Foreign  Direct  Investment11. 
Figure  2  displays  the  external  flows,  showing  that  after  a  long  period  with  a 
preponderance of FDI, in 2016 for the first time it was surpassed by the ODI. Since it 
is  aligned  with  the  new  policy  of  the  Chinese  government  regarding  ODIs,  it  will 
possibly  constitute  a  new  trend,  contributing  to  the  transformation  in  China’s 
International Investment Position.

Therefore, either through flows or through the variation of the external stocks, 
it is clear that the net balance of direct investments in 2015 and 2016 is not relevant as 
a reason for the supposed capital flight in the Chinese economy. 

Still  looking  to  the  external  liabilities  in  Table  1,  the  stock  of  Other 
Investments  decreased  US$  455  billion.  According  to  the  State  Administration  of 
Foreign  Exchange,  many  Chinese  entities  opted  for  accelerating  the  repayment  of 
external loans in order to avoid foreign exchange risks, resulting in the payment of 
US$ 167 billion (SAFE, 2016). At the same time, the country increased its external 
assets  in  Other  Investments.  To  understand  this  movement,  it  is  useful  to  analyse 
China’s Balance of Payments. Table 2 shows that the net result of Other Investments 
had expressive negative values in the period 2014-16 (one could include 2012 in this 
list) due to the net assets increase in 2014 and 2016, as well as the liabilities decrease 
in 2015. 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
11 With the only caveat that changes in external assets and liabilities are caused not only by flows but 
also by price variations.

Notes:  a  positive  value  for  assets  represents  a  net  decrease  while  a  negative  value  represents  a  net 
increase. A positive value for liabilities represents a net increase while a negative value represents a net 
decrease. 
 

When  the  flows  of  Other  Investments  are  disaggregated  (Table  2),  we  may 
notice that in the liabilities side, after a considerable inflow of funds in the form of 
“Loans”  and  “Currency  and  Deposits”  during  the  period  2007/13  (mainly  in  2010, 
2011 and 2013), in 2015 there was an expressive outflow – which meant the reduction 
of  external  liabilities  in  this  item.  The  outflow  of  US$  123  billions  in  this  year  in 
“Currency  and  Deposits”  may  indeed  be  considered  as  a  sign  of  a  possible  capital 
flight. Nevertheless, this needs also to be nuanced. Out of the total amount, US$ 47,7 
billions referred to deposits, meaning the volume of the reduction of deposits held by 
non-residents in China (SAFE, 2017)12. The rest (US$ 75,3 billions) corresponds to 
currency  and,  according  to  IMF  guidelines,  variations  in  the  liabilities  in  this  item 
regards operations in banknotes and coins in local currency (IMF, 2013)13. Hence, the 
decrease in the liabilities in this item means that RMB is being transferred from non-
residents to residents – non-residents are hence buying US dollars to “escape from the 
RMB” or they are simply buying goods and assets in China. 

On the assets side, there is an outflow of funds mainly from 2010 onwards in 
the  form  of  “Loans”,  “Currency  and  Deposits”  and  “Trade  credit  and  advances” 
(mainly on the years 2012, 2014 and 2016), which meant the increase of the external 
asset in this item. 

In  short,  we  may  notice  that  the  country  is  not  only  liquidating  loans, 
denominated in foreign currency, and financing against its economy (decreasing the 
liabilities),  but  it  is  also  doing  the  same  operations  externally,  but  as  a  lender 
(increasing its assets). This may indicate a new financial integration strategy of the 
Chinese economy.  

 Some important characteristics of this new financial integration strategy are 

clearly shown below:

The  major  ways  to  distribute  foreign  exchange  are  to  encourage 
holding of foreign exchange by the people and repayment of the debt. 
Against  the  background  that  RMB  exchange  rate  was  moving  in  the 
direction  of  an  equilibrium  and  remarkably  fluctuating  both  upward  and 
downward,  domestic  enterprises  and  individuals  adjusted  and  optimized 
their  balance  sheets.  In  2014,  newly  increased  foreign  exchange  deposits 
amounted  to  USD  108.4  billion,  and  newly  increased  foreign  exchange 
loans  amounted  to  USD  20.4  billion.  The  difference  between  foreign 
exchange  deposits  and  loans  was  utilized  by  banks  in  foreign  markets, 
which became the major source of remarkably increased external lending 
and  deposits  under  other  investment  assets.  Foreign  assets  holdings 
were  diversified  among  market  participants  instead  of  only  by  the 
government,  whereas 
they  were  controlled  by  domestic  entities. 
Meanwhile, other investment liabilities recorded net inflows of USD 50.2 
billion, a drop in the growth rate by 77 percent year on year, reflecting that 
domestic enterprises had accelerated their repayment of the USD debt 
(SAFE, 2015, p. 21-21; our emphasis). 

 

In  this  sense,  according  to  SAFE  (2015,  p.  42)  China’s  BOP  status  is 
importantly influenced by the Other Investments account, that had a large effect on 
gross flows; for example, in 2014 the other investment outflows accounted for 88% of 
the capital and financial account outflows; and their inflows accounted for 77% of the 
capital and financial account inflows. These are quite expressive values, but which are 
often not perceived when one observes only the net value of the capital and financial 
account. Moreover, it is important to notice, according to SAFE (2015), that due to 
both  domestic  and  international  uncertainties,  China’s  Other  Investments  have 
frequently alternated between surpluses and deficits.  

Nevertheless,  as  Table  2  shows,  between  2014  and  2016  the  country  issued 
expressive  values  of  outflows  within  the  Other  Investments  account.  In  a  2015 
document the SAFE considered that the rising outward flows in that moment was a 
reflection of the “changing expectations of domestic entities regarding the exchange 
rate, interest rate, and market environment, driving them to increase their allocation of 
assets in the international market” (SAFE, 2015, p. 43). Another alleged reason was 
that “domestic banks reduced their external trade finance liabilities, such as letters of 
credit  and  payments  by  overseas  banks  to  avoid  risks”  (op.  cit.,  p.  44).  That  trend 
probably persisted until 2016.   

Finally, there is one more detail that it is worth mentioning.  Table 2 shows 
that  during  the  2007/16  period  approximately  US$  598  billion  exited  China  in  the 
item "Currency and deposits", which means the constitution of a huge Chinese foreign 
asset  in  this  item.  However,  there  is  a  point  that  is  quite  important  for  the 
comprehension of this dynamics that is not being taken into account by the literature: 
the currency of these external flows and stocks. SAFE (2016) shows for instance that 
the China’s banking sector had in 2016 US$ 670.5 billions as external Deposits and 
loans;  out  of  that,  US$  99.6  billions  were  in  Chinese  renminbi.  That  is,  a  non-
negligible part of the Chinese external flows and stocks are in their own currency and 
these  shares  are  increasing.  The  process  of  internationalization  of  the  Chinese 
currency is therefore important for our researches and this analysis is done in the next 
section.

4.  The  International  Monetary  System  hierarchy  and  the  usage  of  the  Chinese 
RMB 
 

The International Monetary System (IMS) has always been asymmetric. As a 
matter  of  fact,  most  of  the  national  currencies  of  the  world  are  not  able  to  fulfil 
classical functions of currency for international economic transactions – that is, they 
do not operate as money beyond the national borders of the countries where they 
were issued. On the other hand, there are some few national currencies that are used 
for international economic operations14. The most used currency is the US dollar; the 
second one is the euro; after them, we may still find a considerable usage of the pound 
sterling, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and to a lesser extent the Canadian dollar 
and the Australian dollar. Not by chance, only currencies issued by central countries 
(Cohen, 1998; De Conti & Prates, 2016). 

The  Chinese  economy  is  already  the  second  biggest  in  the  world,  but  the 
international usage of its currency is far below its importance. The reasons explaining 
this  divergence  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper,  but  we  may  state  at  least  two 
important ones: i) the IMS has an inertia, because the usage of currencies is also based 
in some conventions and networks that are not easily modified; ii) the strict control of 
the financial account and the foreign exchange markets in China, related to a previous 
policy  that  for  many  years  did  not  stimulate  the  international  usage  of  the  Chinese 
RMB. 

Nevertheless, even if it is still not high, the international usage of the Chinese 
currency is clearly rising. Table 3 reveals that the share of the operations in the world 
forex markets that have the RMB in one of the sides of the operation is only 4%15, but 
since 2007 it is roughly doubling every three years.  

For  its  own  international  operations,  China  already  succeeds  in  using  its 
currency in a much higher proportion. According to the PBOC (2016), 28.7% of total 
payments  involving  China  Mainland  and  overseas  parties  were  settled  in  RMB  in 
2015. For international trade, 18.6% of China’s exports and imports were settled in its 
own currency in 2016 (IMI-RUC, 2017). 

It is therefore clear that in spite of its still low position in the IMS hierarchy, 
the  Chinese  RMB  is  unquestionably  increasing  its  role  in  international  economic 
operations. This may seem as a consequence of the raising importance of China for 
the global economy, but that is not the whole story. According to De Conti & Prates 
(2016),  besides  the  economic  and  geopolitical  power,  one  of  the  important 
determinants of the international usage of currencies is the political will, that is, the 
effort of the National State to stimulate – or even enforce – the usage of its currency. 
History shows that England and the United States have frequently created strategies to 
foster or even impose the international usage of their currencies. And the novelty is 
that after a long period in which the Chinese government was not acting in this behalf, 
in the recent period it has explicitly declared its intention and implemented strategies 
for the internationalization of the Chinese RMB – notably after the outbreak of the 
world financial crisis, in 2008.

that are not able to fulfil the classical functions of money for international transactions as peripheral 
currencies.

Note: the sum is 200% because each operation at the forex market involves two currencies. 
  
It  is  evident  that  this  political  will  cannot  have  concrete  results  if  the 
international  community  does  not  see  this  currency  as  reliable  –  reliability  is 
obviously  related  to  the  importance  of  the  economy  that  backs  a  certain  currency. 
Nevertheless, there are already some important signs showing an increasing reliability 
of the Chinese RMB. The most important one came from the International Monetary 
Fund  (IMF)  that  included  the  RMB  in  the  basket  of  currencies  that  compose  the 
Special Drawing Rights (SDR)16. According to the People’s Bank of China, this is “a 
milestone in the process of RMB internationalization” (PBOC, 2016, p. 41)17. 

After all, money is power. And having an international currency is obviously 
part  of  the  Chinese  strategy  to  increase  its  importance  and  influence  in  the  world 
economy. A document by Bloomberg (2017, p. 1) stated that “the yuan’s advance into 
global  markets  demonstrates  President  Xi  Jinping’s  ambition  to  challenge  the 
hegemony  of  the  dollar  and  a  global  economic  order  dominated  by  the  US  and 
Europe”. Actually, the possibility of the Chinese RMB to become a real rival to the 
US dollar as the key-currency of the IMS is still not foreseeable.  But still, even if it is 
not going to be the top currency in the near future, it is undeniable that it is becoming 
an international currency. 
Coming back to the main topic of this paper, it is important to analyse if the 
 
supposed  capital  flight  in  China  relates  somehow  to  this  strategy  of  RMB 
internationalization.  

This  hypothesis  arises  from  the  doubts  about  the  currency  denomination  of 
Chinese economic outflows. Aware of the gradual but unambiguous strategy of the 
Chinese government to internationalize its currency, it is possible to imagine that a 
growing part of the increase in Chinese loans, financings and even overseas deposits 
are being made in RMB and are part of the abovementioned strategy. 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
16 “The weight of the RMB in the SDR basket is 10.92%, whereas the weights of the U.S. dollar, the 
euro,  the  Japanese  yen  and  the  British  pound  are  41.73%,  30.93%,  8.33%  and  8.09%  respectively” 
(PBOC, 2016, p. 43). 
17 Another symbolic event has happened in May 2017, when the European Central Bank has purchased 
Chinese  RMB  to  compose  its  international  reserves  –  the  amount  was  really  low,  but  it  shows  the 
Chinese RMB being already seem as a potential store of value at the international level. 

	  

14	  

The  People’s  Bank  of  China  provides  quite  interesting  data  regarding  this 
issue.  In  2016,  the  international  trade  settled  in  RMB  had  3.79  trillion  yuan18 as 
receipts  and  6.06  trillion  yuan  as  payments.  That  is,  the  cross-border  RMB  flows 
related to trade resulted in a deficit of 2.27 trillion yuan. And this is not by chance, but 
is rather part of the strategy for the internationalization of the RMB. As stated by IMI-
RUC (2017, p. 16), “the expansion of the RMB payment deficit means that the RMB 
flowed  overseas  through  the  trade  channel,  which  is  conducive  to  expanding  the 
offshore capital market and the offshore RMB business”. Chinese government knows 
that one of the functions of a key-currency is providing liquidity to the world: “while 
consolidating  trade  settlement,  we  constantly  strengthen  the  financial  transaction 
function  of  RMB  to  provide  safe  assets  and  inject  liquidity  into  the  international 
community” (op. cit., p. 7). 
 
For the researches regarding capital flights however, it is important to go deep 
into  the  analysis  of  financial  flows.  Starting  with  Direct  Investments,  Chinese 
institutions have been also explicit that this account may be used as a channel for the 
internationalization of the RMB: 
 

Direct  investment  can  expand  the  use  of  RMB  in  many  ways  and  play  an 
efficient  leveraging  role.  It  can  become  an  important  facilitator  of  RMB 
internationalization. In the new situation where the multinational corporations 
dominate  international  trade,  expanding  direct  investment  can  consolidate 
China's  trade  position  and  provide  markets  and  impetuses  for  domestically 
funded financial institutions to go global and develop offshore RMB business 
(IMI-RUC, 2017, p. 5). 
 

 
When we go into the data, we indeed see that the outstanding growth of the 
Chinese direct investments abroad is followed by an equally impressive growth in the 
usage  of  RMB  for  these  investments.  According  to  the  statistics  provided  by  the 
Ministry of Commerce, Chinese direct investments abroad settled in RMB totalized 
1.06 trillion yuan in 2016 – that is, nearly US$ 150 billion or the impressive share of 
81.3% of the total ODI19. Further, the inward FDI in RMB in 2016 reached 1.4 trillion 
RMB.  The  result  in  this  specific  account  –  and  considering  only  the  Direct 
Investments settled in RMB – was a surplus20, but the growing trend of the outward 
flows  allows  us  to  foresee  that  in  the  near  future  this  will  be  another  source  of 
liquidity in RMB for the rest of the world. 
 
Besides Direct Investments, Chinese analysts are aware that the credit market 
is  also  one  of  the  most  important  pillars  to  strengthen  the  financial  transaction 
function of RMB. According to IMI-RUC (2017, p. 21), the balance of RMB overseas 
loans  for  domestic  financial  institutions  reached  in  2016  437.3  billion  yuan  (nearly 
US$ 62 billion). It is still a modest, but raising level (a 38.7% growth compared to 
2015).  The  strategy  is  to  push  international  credit  in  RMB  taking  advantage  of  the 
importance of Chinese trade: 
 

The  dependence  of  the  global  economy  on  China's  trade  has 
increased,  the  problem  of  currency  mismatch  in  developing 
countries  has  made  the  development  of  international  RMB  credit 
market  an  inevitable  trend,  and  the  appreciation  of  the  US  dollar 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
18 The unity of account of the Chinese Renminbi is the yuan. 
19 This amount is obviously inflated by the routine of making ODI through the RMB offshore centers; 
anyway, it shows that these capital flows are leaving China Mainland in RMB and not in US dollars. 
20 This surplus in RMB Direct Investments means non-resident investors have already access to RMB 
offshore, maybe due to the deficit of the trade account in RMB.

provides  a  window  of  opportunity.  History  shows  that  the  main 
international  currency  promotes  the  development  of  international 
credit  market  through  the  international  financial  center  and  trade. 
(IMI-RUC, 2017, p. 6) 

 

 
In line with the analysis presented in section 3, it is clear that from the point of 
view of Chinese assets abroad, nothing allows us to identify a capital flight, but rather 
movements  that  are  related  to  the  Chinese  strategy  of  exporting  capital  and 
internationalizing its currency. Nevertheless, when we move the focus to the liabilities 
(that is, the assets non-residents hold in China), it is undeniable that some problems 
took place in 2015 and 2016. 

Table 4 reveals that the deposits held by non-residents in China declined from 
2.32 trillion yuan in December 2014 to 0.92 trillion yuan two years later. Considering 
all financial assets held by non-residents, there has been a decline of 34% between its 
peak (June 2015) and the end of 2016, when it reached 3.03 trillion yuan (around US$ 
430  billion).  The  total  reduction  has  therefore  been  equivalent  to  1.56  trillion  yuan 
(nearly US$ 220 billion). According to IMI-RUC, this is due notably to: i) in August 
2015 there has been a relaxation in the Chinese exchange rate policy and the RMB 
started  devaluating  against  the  US  dollar21;  ii)  uncertainties  in  the  world  economy, 
notably due to speculations around the possibility of an increase in the basic interest 
rates in the US and later on to the beginning of Donald Trump’s government.

This perception is compatible with the ones in section 3, that is, there has been 
a  net  outflow  of  capital  in  China  in  2015-16  in  the  account  of  Other  Investments 
(notably due to the reduction in Deposits and Loans). But then we arrive to a really 
crucial  perception  for  current  researches:  these  outflows  were  mainly  in  RMB. 
According  to  IMI-RUC  (2017,  p.  13),  “RMB  has  become  the  main  currency  that 
flows  out  of  China’s  border”.  The  same  thing  was  declared  by  Bloomberg  (2016), 
quoting  declarations  by  the  staff  of  Goldman  Sachs:  “a  rising  amount  of  capital  is 
exiting the country in yuan rather than in dollars”; and the Australia & New Zealand 
Banking Group in Hong Kong: “We have seen a structural change in China’s capital 
outflows, with net outbound payments predominantly in yuan this year”. 

Connecting therefore the analysis of sections 3 and 4 – i.e. changes in Chinese 
external stocks and the process of internationalization of the RMB –, we come to a 
pivotal conclusion: there is effectively a net outflow in China in the Other Investments 
account in 2015-16, but the peculiar thing is that these outflows are mostly in RMB 
and  it  is  something  totally  different  from  what  has  frequently  happened  in  many 
peripheral countries through history – namely, a capital flight in US dollars (or other 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
21 Compared  to  what  happens  in  peripheral  countries,  the  devaluations  were  low,  but  for  Chinese 
standards it was something unusual. In August 11th, 2015, the 2% devaluation was the highest in the 
last 20 years in China. 

	  

16	  

central  currencies)  that  begets  a  lack  of  this  currency  (with  harmful  consequences 
over  their  economies,  as  we  have  seen  in  Section  2).  Moreover,  these  outflows  in 
RMB may play a positive role in the process of internationalization of the Chinese 
currency. Even if the agent who takes these RMB out of China immediately sells them 
to an offshore financial institution – that will sell this RMB for instance to an importer 
of Chinese goods – it contributes to the enlargement of the international operations 
made in RMB.  

Finally,  this  situation  engenders  an  important  trade-off  for  the  Chinese 
government, because it may create new regulations to avoid excessive outflows, but 
these measures will be counterproductive in the strategy of RMB internationalization. 
Talking  about  the  changes  in  the  capital  account  management  to  restrict  capital 
outflows,  IMI-RUC  (2017,  p.  13)  says  that  “this  is  of  great  significance  to  China's 
macroeconomic and financial stability, but it is not conducive to the expansion of the 
international use of RMB in the short term”. 

It  means  hence  that  China  is  already  facing  one  of  the  important  dilemmas 
related  to  the  internationalization  of  a  currency,  the  one  between  keeping  strict 
controls over this currency or opening up its financial account in order to foster the 
international  usage  of  this  currency.  Several  authors  foresaw  this  would  eventually 
happen and this is already the case.  
 
Summing  up,  even  if  these  capital  outflows  through  the  Other  Investments 
account were not planned by the Chinese government, they contribute somehow to the 
strategy of RMB internationalization. Obviously, if they create a huge volatility in the 
Chinese  economy,  this  process  will  be  harmful  to  the  reliability  of  the  currency  in 
front of the international community, but this is still not the case. 
 
5. Final remarks 
 

Several articles have suggested the occurrence of a supposed capital flight in 
China  in  2015-16.  The  large  decline  in  China’s  international  reserves  effectively 
attracts  attention  because  it  means  a  reversal  in  the  strong  upward  trend  since  the 
1990s. This paper shows however that the analysis of the phenomenon should not be 
done superficially. First of all, an inspection that looks only to international reserves 
may  be  deceptive,  requiring  researches  over  the  whole  set  of  external  stocks  and 
flows.  Secondly,  it  is  important  to  consider  not  only  the  flows  themselves,  but  the 
currency of these flows. 

Based on these assumptions, this paper raises two main conclusions. The first 
conclusion  is  that  the  impressive  fall  in  the  international  reserves  that  occurred  in 
China in 2015-16 was not only due to a withdraw of international investors’ assets 
from China or indeed to the interventions of the People’s Bank of China at the foreign 
exchange  market  to  avoid  an  extreme  devaluation  of  the  RMB,  but  also  due  to  a 
strategy  of  the  Chinese  government  to  diversify  its  international  assets.  In  reality, 
Chinese international reserves were reduced in US$ 801 billion in 2015-16, but other 
Chinese external assets - Chinese Direct Investment (CDI), Portfolio Investments and 
Other Investments abroad - more than offset this fall, since they increased US$ 824 
billion in the same period. 

However, the analysis of the liability Other Investments reveals a decline of 
US$ 455 billion in this period. There we arrive to the second conclusion, that there 
was  indeed  a  capital  flight  in  China  in  2015-16  mostly  due  to  a  reduction  of  non-
resident deposits and loans in China. This was probably caused by the devaluation of 
the  RMB  and  the  expectations  regarding  an  increase  in  the  Fed  fund’s  rate. 

 

	  

17	  

Nevertheless,  these  outflows  were  mostly  in  RMB  and  this  constitutes  a  crucial 
difference  in  comparison  to  the  capital  flight  that  recurrently  takes  place  in  many 
peripheral countries through history. First of all, because its effects over the domestic 
economy are much lower, since there is no lack of US dollars and no exchange rate 
crisies. Secondly, because it may paradoxically contribute to the internationalization 
of the RMB.
