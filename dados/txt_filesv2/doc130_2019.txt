RESUMO: 

Em 2015, um suposto cartel de licitações que operava no mercado de dispositivos médicos implantáveis foi 
divulgado e as autoridades públicas passaram a investigá-lo. O presente trabalho avalia se há correlação 
sistemática entre os lances ofertados pelos competidores na fase selada das licitações, uma situação que 
poderia  sugerir  a  existência  de  um  comportamento  coordenado  e  fraudulento.  Aplicando  a  estatística  I-
Moran aos resíduos de uma regressão de lances controlada e usando uma base de dados pública e inédita, 
nós mostramos que os lances ofertados pelas empresas investigadas possuem uma autocorrelação positiva 
e estatisticamente significante. Além disso, quando separamos nossos dados em dois subperíodos: período 
em que o cartel provavelmente existiu (2005-2015) e período em que o cartel provavelmente não existiu 
devido  a  celebração  de  um  acordo  de  leniência  (2015-2017),  a  estatística  I-Moran  é  estatisticamente 
significante apenas na primeira subamostra. Os nossos resultados se mantiveram robustos a eliminação de 
períodos de transição e a aplicação de filtros econômicos alternativos. Por fim, nós também discutimos as 
principais vantagens e desvantagens práticas para a implementação do filtro baseado na estatística I-Moran.

ABSTRACT: 

 
In 2015, a supposed bid-rigging cartel that operated in the Brazilian implantable cardiac  devices market 
was announced and public authorities began to investigate it.  This paper evaluates if there is  systematic 
correlation between the bids placed by competitors in the sealed phase of procurement auctions, a situation 
that may suggest a coordinated and fraudulent behavior. Applying the Moran´s  I statistic to residuals of 
controlled bid regressions and using a novelty and public database, we show that the bids placed by the 
investigated companies have a positive and statistically significant autocorrelation. In addition, when we 
break the data into two subperiods: the period in which the cartel probably existed (2005-2015) and the 
period in which the cartel probably did not exist due to the conclusion of a leniency agreement (2015-2017), 
the Moran´s I statistic only points to autocorrelation in the first sub-sample. Our result has remained robust 
due to elimination of transitional periods and the use of alternative economic screens. Finally, we show the 
main  practical  advantages  and  disadvantages  for  the  implementation  of  the  screen  based  on  Moran´s  I 
statistic.

1 – Introduction 

Bid-rigging  occurs  when  a  group  of  companies  participating  in  a  public  procurement  establish 
cooperative agreements with each other to raise prices, divide the market or reduce the quality of goods and 
services that are purchased by the public administration. Considering that the value of public procurement 
account for an estimated 15% of gross domestic product (GDP) worldwide on average according to OECD 
(2009) and the cartel overcharge around 16% (Boyer and Kotchoni, 2015), bid-rigging schemes can roughly 
provoke an economic loss of approximately 2.3% of GDP in the public sector budget. In addition to the 
reduction in economic welfare resulting from the transfer of resources from society to cartel members, the 
practice also causes intangible damage to the economy. For example, cartelization tends to inhibit the entry 
of  new,  potentially  more  efficient  competitors  and,  in  addition,  to  reduce  incentives  for  innovations 
(measured by investment in R&D), as evidenced by Günster et al. (2011).  

 

 

For these reasons, the detection and fighting bid-rigging cartels has become a priority activity by 
antitrust authorities and anti-corruption agencies around the world. Relative to detection, public authorities 
may  act  in  a  reactive  or  proactive  way.  In  the  first  case,  the  investigation  is  opened  when  occurs  an 
anonymous complaint or when a cartel member makes a delation, situation that is materialized in leniency 
programs.  Although it is an efficient strategy, leniency agreements have the limitation of detecting only 
those cartels that are unstable and are close to a breaking point, so that successful cartels remain unscathed 
(Abrantes-Metz and Bajari, 2012). Therefore, is essential to use a proactive approach in such a way that 
public  authorities  are  no  longer  dependent  on  external  information  to  initiate  a  cartel  investigation.  An 
example of proactive practice is the use of economic screenings. Economic screenings are characterized as 
statistical tests that seek to identify anomalous patterns in the distribution of economic variables (prices, 
costs, proposals, bids and market shares) that resemble a non-competitive behavior1. 
In the present paper, we use an economic screening that identifies systematic correlation between 
 
bids  to  investigate  the  behavior  of  a  bid-rigging  cartel.  More  specifically,  we  follow  the  methodology 
recently proposed by Lundberg (2017), in which the Moran´s I statistic is applied to the residuals of a bid 
regression  to  detect  complementary  bidding  on  public  contracts.  The  proposed  screen  is  applied  to  a 
supposed bid-ringing cartel that operates in the implantable cardiac devices (ICD)  market in Brazil. This 
bid-rigging scheme is under investigation by the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) 
and includes a partial leniency agreement involving a company that participates in the alleged  collusion. 
The market covers the sector of implantable cardiac devices, which includes resynchronizers, pacemakers 
and  accessory  items  such  as  electrodes  and  catheters.  According  to  the  investigative  process,  the  cartel 
operated between 2004 and 2015 in all Brazilian territory and comprises a group of four companies, twenty-
nine individuals and two industrial associations. 
There is a vast empirical related literature that implements different types of economic  screen to 
 
detect cartel behavior in public procurements. One tool traditionally employed is the variance screen. It is 
expected that the variance of the  bid’s distributions will be lower in the presence of  bid-rigging cartels. 
According to Imhof (2017), the idea is that by establishing collusion, cartel members exchange information 
and coordinate their bids to reach a minimum threshold of contract value, which tends to be higher than the 
contract value in case of competition. This practice restricts the possible universe of bid values (truncates 
the distribution) and, consequently, reduces variance. Abrantes-Metz et al. (2006) have shown that after the 
collapse of a bid-rigging cartel that supplied seafood to Philadelphia's military installations in the 1980s, 
the average price of the products decreased by 26% and the standard deviation increased by over 260%. 
The studies of Imhof (2017) and Imhof et al. (2018) that investigated bid-rigging cartels that operated in 
road  construction  sector  in  Switzerland  also  apply  the  variance  screen as  one  of the  stages  of the  cartel 
detection, claiming that this statistic is easy to implement due to few data requirements and the low level 
of complexity in its calculation. 
 

In sealed-bid procurement auctions, companies submit their bids simultaneously, so that bid values 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                             
1  As  emphasized  by  Harrington  (2008), the objective  of  economic  screenings  is  to  identify  markets  with  high  probability  of 
collusion. Thus, the screens do not definitively prove the existence of a cartel and, like any other statistical test, may point to 
false positives or false negatives. Therefore, economic screens function as a step to determine in which markets it is necessary 
to open an investigative process or to conduct searches and seizures. 

are only revealed at the end of the auction and on a specific date. Commonly, the public administration 
establishes the company that gives the lowest bid value as the winner of the auction. In this way, if there is 
no coordination between the firms, individual bids will not be conditioned on competitors' bids. Therefore, 
it is expected that the bids will be independent of each other after the control of observed information. This 
condition  -  known  as  conditional  independence  hypothesis  -  was  initially  established  by  Bajari  and  Ye 
(2003) to characterize a distribution of bids to be generated by a model with competitive bidding. A set of 
empirical studies sought to detect bid-rigging cartels by analyzing the interdependence between the bids. 
Jakobsson  (2007)  tested  the  validity  of  the  conditional  independence  hypothesis  for  asphalt-paving 
procurements auctions in Sweden by applying  the spearman rank correlation in pairs of bids. Aryal and 
Gabrielli (2013) developed a two-step procedure using the Bajari and Ye (2003) approach and a structural 
model  applied  to  asymmetric  first-price  auctions  that  compares  bidder  costs  in  both  collusion  and  non-
collusion scenarios. More recently, the conditional independence became analyzed with spatial statistical 
tools, allowing the hypothesis to be tested in a more flexible way by not limiting to tests focused on pair of 
bidders. Bergman et al. (2019) used spatial econometric models and Lundberg (2017) applied the Moran´s 
I statistic to detect whether there is a systematic correlation between bids of a group of companies accused 
of operating an asphalt bid-rigging cartel in Sweden from 1995 to 2001. 

In addition to a smaller variance and bids interdependence, another common characteristic of bid-
rigging cartels is the rotation of winners. The rotating behavior of cartel consists in the artificial exchange 
in relation to the winning bidder in procurement auctions that are frequently by the public administration. 
The study of Ishii (2009) analyzed this behavior in a detailed way. Using data from public procurements of 
Naha  city  (Japan)  for  consulting  works  service,  Ishii  (2009)  showed  that  the  variable  that  measures  the 
score of favor exchange of a particular company in repeated auctions positively affects the win probability 
at  a  future  auction. This  evidence  suggests  that  there  was  a  bid-rigging  cartel  operating  based  on  favor 
exchange with a rotational scheme. Imhof (2017) and Imhof et al., (2018) also proposed a graphical analysis 
of the bids that allows to check the existence of rotating behavior in pairs of competing companies. 

Considering this empirical literature of economic screens applied to bid-rigging cartels, we intend 
to contribute in two ways: I) by applying a methodology that allows to test the conditional independence 
hypothesis in a more flexible manner in relation to previous studies and II) by analyzing the behavior of a 
investigated bid-rigging that operated in the Brazilian market of implantable cardiac devices using a novelty 
and  public  database.  It  should  be  noted  that,  to  our  best  knowledge,  there  isn’t  empirical  studies  that 
employed economic screenings to investigate bid-rigging in Brazilian procurement auctions. Most of the 
screens have been applied to detect price-fixing cartels operating in the fuel station sector (see, for example 
Ragazzo and Silva 2006; Vasconcelos and Vasconcelos, 2005). 

The  remainder  of the  paper is  organized  as  follows:  section  2  presents a  brief  description  of  the 
supposed  bid-rigging  that  operated  in  the  ICD  market  and  describes  the  main  rules  of  the  Brazilian 
procurement auctions. In section 3, we present the econometric setup of the study, and in section 4, we 
describe the database and descriptive statistics. In section 5, we show and discuss the results. Finally, in 
section  6,  we  present  the  conclusions  of  the  paper  and  summarizes  the  main  practical  advantages  and 
disadvantages of applying our screen. 

 

 
 

 

2 – Institutional Background 

2.1 – Description of the supposed bid-rigging cartel 

To evaluates the suitability of the screen based on Moran´s I statistic, we will analyze a supposed 
bid-rigging  scheme  that  operated  in  the  Brazilian  market  of  implantable  cardiac  devices2  (ICD).  The 
disclosure of the alleged bid-rigging cartel began in January 2015, when the Ministry of Health - the public 
agency that makes the purchase of medicines, medical prostheses and hospital equipment for the provision 
of public health services – made a set of complaints pointing to frauds involving the ICD suppliers. Initially, 
there  were  indications  that  ICD  procurements  auctions  were  being  frauded  by  the  observation  of  the 
following practices: identical allocation of contracts, bidding only for contracts that would be effectively 
won,  and  existence  of  figurative  or  coverage  bids.  After  the  complaint,  the  Administrative  Council  for 
Economic Defense (CADE) and the Federal Prosecutor's Office (MPF) began investigating the case and, 
in addition, two Parliamentary Inquiry Committees were opened. 

In  November  2015,  an  involved  company  signed  a  partial  leniency  agreement  with  CADE 
confessing the bid-rigging scheme in the ICD market and committing to collaborate with investigations. 
Due to the collaboration, the company obtained a reduction in administrative and criminal penalties. After 
the conclusion of the leniency agreement, the competition authority made search and seizure operations at 
the  headquarters  and  offices  of  the  companies  involved  and  gathered  more  robust  evidence  about  the 
existence of the bid-rigging cartel. Among the collected evidences, stands out a document created by  the 
set  of  companies  that  contains  a  schedule  with  the  indication  of  the  firms  that  would  win  future  ICD 
procurement  auctions  (Abreu,  2018).  According  to  the  administrative  process,  the  bid-rigging  scheme 
operated in Brazil from 2004 to 2015 and was operated by the four largest companies in the ICD market 
(CADE, 2017). The scheme was coordinated through face-to-face meetings involving company directors 
and, in some situations, were intermediated by industry associations. Public managers and physicians also 
participated  in  the  bid-rigging  scheme  by  facilitating  the  frauds  of  public  procurement  auctions  and 
simulating the need for ICDs in exchange of bribes provided by the companies. 

The anticompetitive practices investigated are the following: exchange of price information, supply 
agreements, customers allocation between competitors and combinations of proposals in the phase of sealed 
bidding. Currently, the case is still being evaluated by the technical area of CADE and the investigation 
involves four companies, 29 individuals and two industrial associations.  
 
2.2 - Procurement auction procedures in the ICD market 

 

The public procurement auctions created for the purchase of ICD items are mostly carried out in the 
electronic modality3 and are governed by  the rules of Brazilian Enactment 5.450/2005. In the electronic 
modality, the public procurements take place virtually and has two different stages. In the first stage, each 
of  the  competitors  makes  their  bid  by  delivering  a  sealed  envelope  with  the  bid  value  to  the  auction 
organizer, functioning like as a sealed-bid auction. Following the opening of envelopes, the second stage 
of the acquisition process starts with a downward oral auction (with simultaneous bids) starting from the 
bid’s values made by the bidders in the first stage. It is not possible for a competitor to bid higher than their 
last registered bid. The  auction winner is the company that presents the lowest bid in the second phase. 
Another important feature of electronic modality is that there is complete anonymity of bidders' identities 
both in the first stage and in the second stage. According to Mattos (2014) this characteristic introduces a 
destabilizing  element  for  cartel  formation,  since  becomes  more  difficult  to  discover  possible  deviations 
from the collusive agreements. 

                                                             
2  The  implantable  cardiac  device  market  involves  the  following  items:  (I)  Implantable  Dual-chamber  and  Unicameral 
Defibrillator Cardioverter (II) Cardiac Resynchronizer, (III) pacemakers - and accessory items - which include (IV) Endocardial 
Electrodes Temporary and Definitive, (V) Sets of Introducers and (VI) Catheter. 

3 Only 18 of the 1351 ICD contracts that we analyzed were taken in the live auction modality. 

Taking  these  rules  into  consideration,  coordinating  first-stage  bids  makes  possible  to  establish  a 
larger starting point for the second stage and avoids offering low-value bids. This favor a potentially higher 
contract price than it would be in case of competition and facilitates the direction of the acquisition process. 
In this way, our screening method seeks to capture a possible bid coordination in the first stage of electronic 
procurement auction, which would be an indication of a broader collusive agreement. 
 

3 – Methodology  

 

Before calculating the Moran´s I statistic, it is necessary to construct a weighting matrix (also called 
bidding matrix) that associates the set of potentially cartelized firms with each other. The bidding matrix 
was applied by Lundberg (2017) and Bergman et al. (2019) and has a construction similar to the traditional 
spatial matrices that are used to establish geographical relations between different spatial units. Initially, it 
is assumed that there are two types of bidders: those that engage in collusive activities (type A firms) and 
those that act competitively (type B firms). In first-price sealed auctions, type A firms place complementary 
bids, while bids placed among type B firms and across type A and type B firms tend to be independent. 
Complementarity of bids is a strategy that simulates competition and is commonly adopted by bid-rigging 
cartels.  It  is  characterized  when  a  firm  (previously  defined  by  cartel  members)  bid  lower  to  win  the 
procurement auction while other cartel members offer higher bids in exchange for future rewards, such as 
subcontracting, consortium formation, or auctions victory, for example. In the context of the Brazilian ICD 
procurement auctions, complementary bidding in the first stage of the electronic auction can be an optimal 
strategy to manipulate the final auction outcome (see subsection 2.2) and allows a potential overcharge in 
contracts. 

Denote  by  𝑏𝑖𝑐  the  bid  value  placed  by  firm  𝑖  on  contract  𝑐,  𝑛𝑎  the  number  of  bids  placed  by 
companies of type A, 𝑛𝑏 the number of bids placed by companies of type B and 𝑛𝑐 is the total number of 
bids that is equal to the total number of  observations 𝑁 = 𝑛𝑐 = 𝑛𝑎 + 𝑛𝑏. Define the bidding matrix as a 
matrix 𝑾  of  dimension 𝑁𝑥𝑁  with  elements  𝑤𝑖𝑐,𝑗𝑐  such  that 𝑤𝑖𝑐,𝑗𝑐 > 0  if  𝑖 ≠ 𝑗  and  𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ 𝐴.  Otherwise, 
𝑤𝑖𝑐,𝑗𝑐 = 0. It is observed that the bids are independent across the different contracts (𝑤𝑖𝑐,𝑗𝑘 = 0 𝑖𝑓𝑐 ≠ 𝑘) 
and independent between the set of non-collusive bidders (𝑤𝑖𝑐,𝑗𝑐 = 0 if  𝑖  ∈ 𝐵 or/and 𝑗  ∈ 𝐵). Finally, the 
magnitude of the matrix 𝑾 weights is defined as follows: 𝑤𝑖𝑐,𝑗𝑐 = 1 (𝑁𝐴𝐶 − 1)
, where 𝑁𝐴𝑐 is the number 
of type A firms participating in the procurement auction relating to the contract 𝑐. This adjustment allows 
us  to  obtain  a  row  standardized  matrix.  There  are  situations  in  which  the  identity  of  the  companies 
participating in the bid-rigging schemes (type A firms) is unknown. In this case, Lundberg (2017) suggests 
defining potential cartel members on the basis of some prior suspicion (obtained through denunciations or 
leniency programs, for example) or by constructing a set of bidding matrices that simulate possible cartel 
combinations between three or four companies with  higher market power or those that participate in the 
procurement auctions more frequently. 

⁄

To detect a complementary bidding behavior - which may indicate the existence of a  bid-rigging 
scheme - the next step is to calculate the global Moran´s I statistic, developed by Moran (1948) and widely 
used  to  detect  the  existence  of  spatial  autocorrelation.  The  global  Moran´s  I  statistic  is  obtained  by 
calculating the following expression: 

 

𝐼 =

∑ ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑐,𝑗𝑐

𝑗

𝑖

(𝑏𝑖𝑐 − 𝜇)(𝑏𝑗𝑐 − 𝜇)

∑ (𝑏𝑖𝑐 − 𝜇)2

𝑖

                                                                                   (1) 

 
Where 𝑤𝑖𝑐,𝑗𝑐 is the elements of bidding matrix 𝑾 described above, 𝑏𝑖𝑐 is the bid value placed by 
firm 𝑖 on contract 𝑐, 𝑏𝑗𝑐 is the bid value placed by firm 𝑗 and, finally, 𝜇 is the average bid value. Under the 
hypothesis of absence of autocorrelation, it is possible to demonstrate that the expectation of Moran´s  I 
statistic is given by 𝐸(𝐼) = −1 (𝑁 − 1)
, tending to zero to the extent that 𝑁 →  ∞.  To detect if there is 
autocorrelation  between  the  bids,  the  null  hypothesis  𝐻0: 𝐼  = −1 (𝑁 − 1)
  is  confronted  with  the 
alternative hypothesis 𝐻𝑎: 𝐼  ≠ −1 (𝑁 − 1)
. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the Moran´s I test points to 

⁄

⁄

the existence of autocorrelation between the bids. In this case, there is evidence that companies are adopting 
a bidding complementarity behavior in a systematic way, characteristic of bid-rigging arrangements. The 
value of Moran´s  I statistic ranges from  -1 to +1. Negative  values indicate negative autocorrelation and 
positive values indicate positive autocorrelation. 

The  problem  with  this  approach  is  that  bids  may  have  autocorrelation  in  sealed  auctions  due  to 
natural market factors, not necessarily related to collusive behavior. For example, bids tend to be correlated 
when the different companies participating in the procurement auction have a similar cost structure, operate 
in the same geographic market, have a similar scale of production or when the bidding process occurs for 
the supply of goods and services in a specific area. In these situations, the Moran´s I test can generate a 
series of false positives. One way to minimize this problem is to estimate a bid regression to generate 𝑏𝑖𝑐 
free from the influence of market variables. In this sense, we apply the Moran´s I statistic to the residuals 
of the following bid regression: 

 

𝑏𝑖𝑐 = 𝛾𝑋𝑖𝑐 + 𝜃𝑠 + 𝜆𝑝 + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑐                                                                             (2) 

 
Where  𝑏𝑖𝑐  is  the  dependent  variable  and 𝑋𝑖𝑐  is  set  of  controls  that captures  observable variables 
(company-specific and contract-specific) with potential to influence the magnitude of the placed bids. In 
addition to the observable variables, the bid regression can be estimated by including  unobserved fixed-
effects associated with the type and specification of the ICD item in question (𝜃𝑠), procurement specific 
effects (𝜆𝑝), and firm specific effects (𝜇𝑖). Therefore, when applying the Moran´s I statistics on the residuals 
of equation (2), a potential systematic correlation between the bids can be attributed to another unobservable 
variables, which include the collusive behavior.  
 

4 - Data and Descriptive Statistics 

 

The  database  used  in  the  present  study  is  public  and  were  obtained  through  the  Integrated 
Administration and General Services System (Comprasnet - SIASG) of the Brazilian Federal Government. 
In  this  platform,  the  public  administration  operates  and  retains  information  regarding  its  purchase  and 
contracts. This includes the registration and disclosure of public procurements, the correspondent record of 
prices and supplier’s identity and the registration and management of contracts. Considering our objective, 
we  filtered  this  database  to  get  information  from  the  procurement  auctions  related  to  the  Implantable 
Cardiac Devices (ICD) market and involving the participation of at least one of the firms investigated for 
bid-rigging collusion.  
 
Thus,  we  obtained  a  dataset  contain  information  on  238  public  procurements  involving  1351 
different  contracts4  and  4679  bids  submitted  by  147  companies  in  the  period  from  January  2005  to 
December  2017.  The  following  information  is  available  in  our  database:  date  of  public  procurement, 
identity of bidders, auction modality (electronic or live mode), municipality and public agency responsible 
for purchase, product code5, product specification, bid values placed in the first stage of the auction, value 
estimated6 by the public administration, number of demanded items,  identification of the winner and the 
final value of the purchased item. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the total number of  ICD contracts per 
year  and  the  respective  proportion  of  contracts  won  by  the  four  companies  investigated  by  bid-rigging 
collusion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                             
4 A single public procurement may involve several different contracts. Thus, competition occurs at the contract level. 
 
5 There are 366 different categories of implantable cardiac devices. 
 
6 The estimated value of the item or reference value is a cost estimate that the requesting public agency stipulates as a forecast 
of how much will be spent on the contract. 

Figure 1 - Evolution of the Number of Contracts in the ICD market. 

 

Note: Own elaboration based on SIASG data. 

 
We note that there is a strong variability in the number of contracts signed each year and an abrupt drop in 
2015  (58%  in  relation  to  the  previous  year),  coinciding  exactly  with  the  year  in  which  the  leniency 
agreement  was  concluded  with  CADE.  In  addition,  it  is  noted  that  the  companies  investigated  by  bid-
rigging cartel have substantial participation in the ICD market, with participation varying from 54% to 89% 
per year. 

Regarding  the  variables  used  in  the  bid  regression  estimation,  our  dependent  variable  will  be 
measured  as  the  ratio  between  the  bid  value  placed  in  the  first  stage  of  electronic  auction  and  the 
correspondent bid value estimated by the public administration. This adjustment by the estimated bid value 
is  important  to  eliminate  the effect  generated  by  bidding  for  a  common  target,  which  would  generate a 
spurious correlation between the placed bids of different competitors. In addition,  this is also useful for 
standardizing the unit of measure of the dependent variable, since the monetary values of ICD items tend 
to  vary  according  to  their  different  types  and  specifications.  In  the  vector  of  control  variables,  we  will 
include the following: I) Capacity Rate of firm 𝑖: is defined as the ratio between the number of contracts 
won by the firm up to the date of the contract 𝑐 and the total number of contracts to be obtained until the 
end of the year in question; II) Number of employees of firm 𝑖; III) Number of competitors participating in 
the procurement auction associated to contract 𝑐, and IV) Number of ICD items to be contracted by the 
public administration through the contract 𝑐. The number of employees of each firm was obtained through 
the Annual Report of Social Information (RAIS) of the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE) and the 
number of competitors, the capacity rate, and the number of items per contract were directly calculated 
using our bid data. Table 1 shows the mean and standard deviation of the variables for the entire data set, 
for the subset restricted to the period in which the bid-rigging cartel was supposed to operate (January 2005 
to  October  2015)  and  for  the  subset  restricted  to  the  period  following  the  conclusion  of  the  leniency 
agreement (November 2015 to December 2017).

From Table 1, it can be observed that there are no large discrepancies in the descriptive statistics of the 
variables selected between the period of the alleged  bid-rigging (2005 to 2015) and  the period after the 
leniency  agreement  (2015  to  2017).  At  first,  this  suggests  that  there  was  no  structural  change  in  the 
implantable cardiac devices market.

Table 2 shows the results of the estimation of equation (2) by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) using 
three different specifications. The first one (column (1)) considers only the inclusion of observed control 
variables, the second (column (2)) adds the firm fixed effect and the ICD type fixed effect and the third 
specification (column (3)) presents the specification adding the procurement fixed effects. The dependent 
variable is the log of the adjusted bid value.

The Moran’s I statistic applied to the residuals of the bid regressions is showed at the bottom of the Table 
2.  As  can  be  seen,  independent  of  the  specification,  the  Moran’s  I  statistic  is  positive  and  statistically 
significant. This evidence indicates that the bids placed by the companies investigated by bid-rigging cartel 
in the ICD market have positive autocorrelation, violating the hypothesis of conditional independence. In 
practical  terms,  this  positive  correlation  between  bids  of  different  competitors  in  the  first  stage  of  the 
electronic  auction  (which  are  governed  by  a  sealed  auction  design)  can  suggest  the  existence  of  a 
coordinated scheme characterized by complementary bidding. Thus, our economic screen captures exactly 
what was identified  by the documentary  evidences collected by the Brazilian competition authority (see 
subsection 2.1). 

Regarding  the  covariates,  we  observed  a  negative  association  between  the  capacity  rate  and  the 
placed bid, indicating that firms that are closer to their supply limit end up making more aggressive bidding.  
However, this counterintuitive relationship does not hold in the most complete specifications (column (3)). 
The log of number of employees (proxy for firm size) and the number of items that are demanded in each 
contract also negatively affect the value of placed bids.  This indicates that competitors tend to bid more 
aggressively when the firm size is larger and there is a greater possibility of economies of scale, an expected 
result.  The number of competitors of a specific contract does not affect the behavior of companies in ICD 
procurement auctions. 

Table 3 shows the estimates of our bid regression and the Moran’s I statistic separated for two data 
periods: the period from January 2005 to October 2015 (period in which there is documentary evidence of 
the operation of bid-rigging scheme) and the period between November 2015 and December 2017, where 
it is likely that the bid-rigging cartel not operate due to the conclusion of a leniency agreement with CADE. 
We show the results of the more complete bid regression specification.

using the row-standardized bidding matrix described in section 2. The dependent variable is the log of the 
adjusted bid value. 

 

The  results  shown  in  Table  3  indicate  that  the  Moran’s  I  statistic  is  positive  and  statistically 
significant  for  the  period  of  alleged  ICD  bid-rigging  operation  (column  (1),  suggesting  complementary 
bidding in the first stage of the procurement auction) and is not statistically significant and close to zero for 
the  period  in  which  the  bid-rigging  cartel  was  not  supposed  to  operate  (column  (2)).  Thus,  the  applied 
economic screen accurately captures the coordinating behavior when the alleged cartel  probably existed 

and does not capture the coordination behavior when the alleged cartel probably did not exist. The evidence 
from Table 3 is similar the results of Lundberg (2017) study, which analyzed an Swedish asphalt bid-rigging 
cartel  and  applied  the  Moran’s  I  statistic  for  two  different  time  intervals  and  the  screen  pointed  to  the 
existence  of  the  cartel  only  in  the  period  in  which  the  scheme  was  effectively  observed.  Therefore,  the 
screen  based  on  Moran’s  I  statistics  to  detect  bid-rigging  cartels  seems  to  work  well  even  in  different 
institutional contexts. 
 
5.2 – Robustness Checks  
 

Column (2) of Table 3 shows that our screen does not  indicate a coordinating behavior after the 
leniency agreement has been made. However, the cartel firms may have incentives to keep the collusive 
scheme  in  the  short  term  to  reduce  damages,  even  after  the  cartel  has  been  discovered  (Erutku,  2012). 
Another possibility is that the cartel discontinues the practice in the period immediately after the leniency 
agreement and returns to coordination after some time. In these situations, the estimated Moran’s I statistic 
for the post-cartel period would be underestimated and incorrectly suggesting that there is no coordination 
between firms in the post-cartel period. To reduce these concerns, we calculated the Moran’s I statistic for 
the  post-cartel  period  by  removing  the  supposed  transition  periods  from  the  database  (we  assume  the 
transition period of three, nine or twelve months after the leniency agreement). Table 4 presents the results.

only the post-cartel period and removing transition periods. We assume transitional periods of three months 
(column  (1)),  nine  months  (column  (2))  and  twelve  months  (column  (3)).  The  Moran’s  I  statistic  is 
calculated using the row-standardized bidding matrix described in section 2. The dependent variable is the 
log of the adjusted bid value. 

 
As can be seen in Table 4, the Moran’s I statistic remains  not statistically  significant for the post-cartel 
period, suggesting that possible transition periods do not seem to be relevant to change our results. 

To check the robustness of the results, we also tested the hypothesis of conditional independence 
using economic screenings different from the Moran’s I statistic. The first one is based on  Bajari and Ye 
(2003) and tests the possibility of bid coordination by checking whether the residuals of firm 𝑖´𝑠 bid function 
and residuals of firm 𝑗´𝑠 bid function are correlated. Thus, it is a correlation test targeted to pairs of biddings 
sets of specific firms. Table 5 shows the number of simultaneous bids (which disputed the same contracts) 
and the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients considering the six possible combinations of pairs 

of companies accused of bid-rigging cartel in the ICD Brazilian market. The residuals were obtained by 
OLS estimation considering the most complete specification of equation (2).

Table 5 reveals that in practically all pair of simultaneous bids placed by the accused firms the correlation 
coefficient is positive, and the hypothesis of no correlation is rejected (the only exception is the Pearson 
correlation coefficient associated with the set of bids of firm 1 and firm 4). Thus, this economic screen also 
points to the existence of a systematically correlation between bids in the first phase of the procurement 
auctions of Brazilian ICD market. 

A  second  alternative  way  of  testing  the  hypothesis  of  conditional  independence  is  to  use  the 
Bergman et al. (2019) approach and estimate the bid regression with the inclusion of a spatial lag in the 
dependent variable, a specification known as Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR): 

 

𝑛

𝑏𝑖𝑐 = 𝜌 ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑏𝑗𝑐

+  𝛾𝑋𝑖𝑐 + 𝜃𝑠 + 𝜆𝑝 + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑐                                                              (3) 

𝑗=1

 
Where  𝑏𝑖𝑐  is the adjusted bid, 𝜌 is a parameter that captures the degree of dependence between bids placed 
by type A firms, 𝑋𝑖𝑐 is a vector of observables variables that can affect our dependent variable and 𝑤𝑖𝑗 are 
elements of the bidding matrix described in section 3. Thus, the dependence between bids (which suggests 
a coordinating behavior) can be evaluated by checking whether the spatial lag parameter (𝜌) is statistically 
significant. In this case, the interpretation would be that the bid placed by firm 𝑖 is associated with the bid 
placed by the firm 𝑗, controlling for  all characteristics included in bid regression (3). Table 6 shows the 
estimated SAR using the maximum likelihood  estimation. Column (1) presents the results restricting the 
data to  the  period  in  which  the  bid-rigging  cartel  was  supposed to  operate  (2005-2015)  and  column  (2) 
presents the results considering the post-cartel period (2015-2017). 

Column  (1)  of  Table  6  indicates  that  𝜌  is  positive  and  statistically  significant,  while  column  (2) 
shows that 𝜌 is close to zero and is not statistically significant. This suggests that bids placed by companies 
investigated  for  collusive  behavior  are  positively  correlated  and  violates  the  conditional  independence 
hypothesis only in the period in which the  bid-rigging cartel is supposed to  exist. Thus, both the screen 
based on correlation tests between pairs of bid regression residuals (table 5) and the screen based on spatial 
bid regressions (table 6) confirm our conclusions obtained with the Moran’s I statistic and reinforce the 
existence of autocorrelation between the bids placed in the first stage of the ICD procurement auctions.

6 – Conclusions 

In  the  present  paper  we  propose  an  economic  screening  that  identifies  systematic  correlation 
between bids to investigate the behavior of alleged bid-rigging cartel that operates in the Brazilian market 
of implantable cardiac devices. Applying the Moran’s I statistic to residuals of bid regressions and using 
the SIASG database, we show that bids placed by the accused companies have a systematic autocorrelation 
in the sealed phase of the electronic auctions, which suggests a complementary bidding behavior, common 
characteristic of bid-rigging cartels. Additionally, in the period in which the alleged cartel probably existed 
(2005-2015), the Moran’s I statistic captured the coordinating behavior and in the period after the leniency 
agreement (2015-2017), the proposed screen does not capture the coordinating behavior. This result was 
robust to elimination of transitional periods and the use of other alternative economic screens that checks 
the hypothesis of conditional independence in sealed auctions. 

The main advantage of the economic screen based on Moran’s I statistic is the low data requirements 
and the computational and statistical simplicity. In addition, the screen is versatile and can be applied to 
any type of market where the public procurements are governed by sealed auctions. However, the Moran’s 
I statistic requires prior knowledge regarding the identity of the companies that may form the  bid-rigging 
cartel. Without information from documentary evidence, denunciations or leniency agreements, it becomes 
more difficult to construct the bidding matrix and to proceed with screen application. A partial solution to 
this disadvantage is to apply the economic screen to combinations of all sets of companies or apply only to 
those with the largest market share or to the most frequent bidders. Finally, another shortcoming of our 
economic screen is the possibility of pointing to the existence of a bid-rigging cartel when it does not really 
exist (false positives). This can occur when bids are correlated due to the existence of unobserved variables 
that influence the placed bids. Therefore, our screen cannot be used as an isolated and definitive proof of 
the existence of the bid-rigging scheme and makes necessary to collect additional documentary evidence.
