Abstract: Brazil confirmed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 2008, including an 80% 
reduction in deforestation in the Amazon by 2020. With this in mind, we investigated the trade-off 
between environmental conservation and economic growth in the Amazon. The aim of this study is to 
project the economic losses and land-use changes resulting from a policy to control deforestation and the 
rise in land productivity that is necessary to offset those losses. We developed a Dynamic Interregional 
Computable General Equilibrium Model for 30 Amazon regions with a land module allowing conversion 
between types of land. The results have shown that the most affected regions would be soybeans and 
cattle producers as well as regions dominated by family farms. To offset these impacts, it was estimated 
that an annual gain of land productivity of approximately 1.4% would be required.

1.  Introduction and Background 

Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has attracted the attention of researchers and public 

authorities towards methods and policies that involve both its measurement and control. In addition to the 
importance of conserving one of the largest biomes of ecological diversity (Peres et al., 2010) and 
harboring the largest area of primary forest in the world - 35% of the world’s total primary forest (FAO, 
2010) - the region has become the target of policies to reduce deforestation because it constitutes an 
important measure in the mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG).  

The Amazon region has already lost about of 15% of its total forest area. However, according to 

INPE (2013), there was a decline in deforestation rates from 2004 to 2012. This decline is related to 
economic factors, such as the reduction in international soybean and beef prices and the appreciation of 
the Brazilian currency, which discouraged exports. Another contributing factor is the increased 
surveillance of the Amazon, which has been made possible by the implementation of government 
programs, such as the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon 
(Soares-Filho et al., 2009; Assunção et al., 2012). 

Arima and Verissimo (2002) pointed out that the three major forms of deforestation in the 

Amazon are: i) the conversion of forest into pasture for livestock; ii) cutting and burning to convert forest 
into crops for family farming; and iii) deployment of grain crops by agro-industry. Of these, the 
conversion of forests into pasture is predominant (Margulis, 2003). They have also argued that the drastic 

2 

 

reduction in tax incentives for agricultural enterprises in the late 1980s lead to a reduction in the pace of 
deforestation, which, however, did not occur. In the 1990s, other factors than the government 
development projects1 became more decisive in the maintenance of deforestation, primarily predatory 
logging, extensive livestock farming and agrarian reform settlements2. 

Some projections suggest that deforestation, despite a reduction in its rates between 2004 and 

2012, may expand in the coming decades. Soares Filho et al. (2005) estimated that the projected 
deforestation will eliminate 40% of the current 5.4 million km2 of forests by 2040 if the occupancy 
patterns follow the trajectory of the last two decades. Moreover, an increase in deforestation implies a 
growth of GHG emissions associated with changes in land use. According to Gouvello (2010)’s 
estimates, the total emissions from land-use changes and forests in Brazil may grow by 25% by 2030, 
reaching an annual rate of 916 thousand tons of CO2 equivalent, which may compromise the target 
reductions of reducing GHG proposed by the Brazilian government. 

The latest deforestation estimates in the Amazon published by INPE (INPE, 2013) showed that 

from 2012 to 2013, there was an approximate 30% increase in the deforestation rate, which seems to 
confirm these previous projections. Although it is the second lowest rate recorded by INPE since the 
monitoring system began in 1988, it is an indication that deforestation could increase in the future. The 
prospect of increased deforestation in the Amazon has even more force when considering the adoption of 
some measures in the New Forest Code3, which was approved in May 2012. Included among the points of 
the New Code is a reduction of the limit of the legal reserve (RL) in the region4 and a regularization of the 
smallholder farmers, excluding them from the obligation of recovering areas that were deforested in 
permanent preservation areas (APPs.) According to IPEA (2011), the recovery of deforested legal 
reserves would offset the emissions of 3.15 billion tons of carbon, which would be enough to meet the 
Brazilian government’s four-year target to reduce emissions from deforestation. 

This target assumed by the Brazilian government was presented in 2009 at COP155. The proposal 
was a voluntary reduction in GHG emissions mainly through an 80% reduction in deforestation by 2020. 
Thus, combating deforestation in Brazil has become a priority for the government as well as for the 
international organizations that are concerned with global warming’s effects. According to Fearnside 
(2005), an effective surveillance and the collection of taxes from those who do not have authorization 
from the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) should be 
accompanied by the necessary understanding of the social, economic and political aspects of the region. 
Bringing this concern to the economy of the regions in the Amazon, the question arises as to how the 
control of deforestation can restrict agricultural expansion, which represents an important economic 
activity in the region. Without alternatives for growth in agriculture and other sectors, which are 
indirectly affected, there may be a tradeoff between the goals of regional economic growth and the 
preservation of the forest. 

Some options are indicated to reconcile the economic growth of the region with sustainable 

development and the reduction of deforestation. One refers to intensifying agriculture by increasing land 
productivity. This increase in productivity would allow the same area, which has been deforested, to 
produce a greater output amount without expanding the deforested area as crop or pasture land through 
additional deforestation. 

                                                           
1 The government development projects appear to affect deforestation, mainly in the decades of 1970 and 1980 (Pfaff, 1999). 
2 Land reform policies and violent conflict in the Amazon region can be seen in Alston et al., 2000. 
3 The Brazilian Forest Code was created by Law No. 4771 on September 15, 1965. The Code sets limits on property use, which 
must coincide with existing vegetation on the ground for the common good of all inhabitants of Brazil. The first Brazilian 
Forest Code was established by Decree No. 23,793, on January 23, 1934.  
4 The portion to be preserved in the current Forest Code is 80%, but is decreased to 50% in states that have 65% of their 
territory designated as protected areas or indigenous lands.  
5 COP15 (United Nations Conference on Climate Change), held from December 7-18, 2009, in Copenhagen brought together 
193 member countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Its proposal was to define a global 
action agenda to control global warming and ensure the survival of the human species.

In this context, it is relevant to investigate the aspects of a possible tradeoff between 

environmental conservation and economic growth in the region. Furthermore, it is important to 
understand the relationship among agricultural activities with the land occupation and use. The goals of 
this paper, therefore, are: i) to evaluate the impacts of land-use policies on regional growth in Amazon6; 
ii) to investigate the role of agricultural technical improvement in the region. We built an interregional 
dynamic computable general equilibrium model (CGE) for 30 regions in the Amazon and the rest of 
Brazil, called REGIA (Interregional General Equilibrium Model for the Brazilian Amazon)7. REGIA has 
a module of land-use change that enables it to model the conversion of different categories of land use. 
The incorporation of the land module into REGIA is fundamental in the analysis of the effects of a policy 
that restricts land use and directly affects the agricultural activity in the region.  

Therefore, REGIA was used to simulate a scenario considering the targeted deforestation 

reduction of 80% by 2020 in accordance with the National Plan on Climate Change - PNMC (2008), 
followed by a hypothetical zero deforestation policy from 2021 to 2030. Moreover, a simulation was 
performed to estimate the land productivity gains needed to offset the adverse effects of the deforestation 
policy on the Amazon economy.  

 

2.  METHODOLOGY   
2.1 REGIA model 

REGIA is a Computable General Equilibrium model (CGE) with a recursive dynamic and land-

use module for 30 regions of the Brazilian Legal Amazon8 and the rest of Brazil. It is a bottom-up model, 
that is, a multiregional model where the national results are aggregations of the regional results. 
Moreover, it is the first CGE model built for the Amazon economy with this very detailed regional 
disaggregation. 

REGIA has some improvements over other CGE models that also examined issues related to the 
Amazon and deforestation, such as Pattanayak et al. (2009) and Cattaneo (2001). The first improvement 
is the treatment of land use in a recursive dynamic model so we can analyze the impacts of different 
scenarios over time as well as the endogenous adjustment of land supply. The second improvement is the 
largest regional disaggregation - 30 regions of the Amazon and the rest of Brazil.  

REGIA has a core theoretical structure similar to the Australian TERM, an acronym for The 

Enormous Regional Model (Horridge et al., 2005). TERM is a Johansen type bottom-up multi-regional 
CGE model that is derived from the continued development of the ORANI (Dixon et al., 1982) model and 
its generic version, the ORANI-G (Horridge, 2000). TERM was developed to address disaggregated 
regional data and also to allow for the generation of faster solutions for simulations relative to available 
models (Horridge et al., 2005). 

REGIA is composed of blocks of equations that determine relationships between supply and 
demand, according to optimization assumptions and market-clearing conditions. In addition, several 
national aggregates are defined in these blocks as the aggregate employment, GDP, balance of trade and 
price indexes. The most productive sectors minimize production costs subject to a technology of constant 
returns to scale in which the combinations of intermediate inputs and primary factors (aggregated) are 
determined by fixed coefficients (Leontief). There is substitution via the prices of domestic and imported 
goods in the composition of inputs according to the function of the constant elasticity of substitution 
(CES). A CES specification also controls the allocation of a domestic compound among the various 
regions. In REGIA, substitution also takes place between capital, labor and land in the composition of the

7 REGIA refers to the aquatic lily pad that is typical of the Amazon region. It has a large leaf-shaped circle, which lies on the 
surface of the water, and can grow to be up to 2.5 meters in diameter and support up to 40 pounds if well-distributed on its 
surface.

primary factors through CES functions; however, the land factor is allocated only in the agriculture and 
livestock sectors. 

The goods of a given region that are directed to another are compounded by the basic values and 

the trade and transport margins. The share of each margin in the delivery price is a combination of source, 
destination and goods source (domestic or imported). Margins on goods from one region to another can 
be produced in different regions. It is expected that margins are distributed more or less equally between 
the origin and destination or between intermediate regions in the case of transport from more distant 
regions. In addition, there is substitution between suppliers of margins, according to a CES function. 

In the model, there is a representative household for each region consuming domestic and 

imported goods. The choice between domestic and imported goods (from other countries) is held by a 
CES (Armington assumption9) specification. The treatment of household demand is based on a combined 
system of preferences, CES/Klein-Rubin. Thus, the utility derived from consumption is maximized 
according to this utility function. The specification gives the linear expenditure system (LES)10, in which 
the share of expenditure above the subsistence level for each good represents a constant proportion of the 
total subsistence expenditure of each family. 

The REGIA model has a recursive dynamic specification. Investment and capital stock follow 

mechanisms of accumulation and intersectoral shift from pre-established rules related to the depreciation 
and rates of return. Thus, one of the modifications to make REGIA a dynamic model was to connect the 
annual investment flows to the capital stocks.  

The model does not include a process of temporal labor market adjustment. For the simulations in 

this paper, which has a time horizon of 25 years, a configuration was adopted where the national 
aggregated employment in the baseline is exogenous (from 2006 to 2011, adjusted with observed data, 
and from 2012 is determined by population growth). In the policy scenario, the aggregate national 
employment is fixed relative to the baseline scenario. This implies an endogenous response of the average 
wage with the fixed sectoral wage and regional wage differentials. Thus, there is intersectoral and 
regional labor mobility. 

Government consumption is exogenous. The model operates with market equilibrium for all 

goods, both domestic and imported, as well as the market factors (capital, land and labor) in each region. 
The purchase prices for each user in each region (producers, investors, households, exporters, and 
government) are the sum of the basic values,  sales taxes (direct and indirect) and margins (trade and 
transport). Sales taxes are treated as ad valorem taxes on basic flows. Demands for margins (trade and 
transport) are proportional to the flow of goods to which the margins are connected. 

2.2 The Land Use Module 

One of the advantages of REGIA is the incorporation of a land-use module. Land is one of the 

primary factors in the model, in addition to capital and labor, and it is an important factor in the 
production of agricultural sectors. Land use is modeled separately for each region, keeping the total area 
fixed and divided into four types: i) cropland, ii) pasture, iii) planted forest and iv) natural forest and other 
areas. In the model, the agricultural sectors/goods, as well as land use, are specific to each region. 

It is assumed that each agricultural sector of the model is connected to one of these types of land 

uses. The area of natural forest and other uses is defined as the total area of each region minus the 
cropland, pasture and planted forest. That is, it includes all of the areas that are not used in agro-forestry 
systems, such as natural forests, urban areas, mountains, roads and rivers. These latter areas are thought to 
change more slowly than natural forests, and therefore, the change (decline) in this type of land use is a 
proxy for measuring deforestation by the expansion of agriculture or forestry. 

                                                           
9 Armington hypothesis - goods of different origins are treated as imperfect substitutes.  
10 The LES function is suitable for broad aggregates of goods where specific substitutions are not considered. That is, cross-
price elasticities are equal to the income effect given in the Slutsky equation without any contribution from the cross-price 
effects. This implies that all goods have a weak complementarity. The linear expenditure system does not allow the inclusion 
of inferior goods (that is, negative income elasticities). 

 

Land may be allocated between different agricultural sectors according to the remuneration gap.

𝑥𝑖𝑟 = 𝑥𝑟 + 𝛼𝑙𝑛𝑑(𝑝𝑖𝑟 − 𝑝𝑟)                                                                                          (1) 

Thus, the demand for land responds to changes in the land remuneration to each sector. Each land use 
(cropland, pasture and planted forest) is distributed in year t according to a CET (constant elasticity of 
transformation) function11 between different goods for each region: 
 
where 𝑥𝑖𝑟 is the percentage change in the demand for land allocated to sector i12 in region r; 𝑝𝑖𝑟 is the 
percentage change in the land remuneration to sector i in region r; xr is the percentage change of the total 
land (cropland, pasture and planted forest) in region r; and pr is the average remuneration to all sectors in 
region r. Thus, if in one region the remuneration to sector i is above the average remuneration to the 
region (𝑝𝑖𝑟 − 𝑝𝑟 > 0), then a positive change in the allocation of land will occur toward sector i. 
The total change in the demand for each land use for each region is given by 𝑥𝑟 = ∑ 𝑆𝑘𝑥𝑘

, using 

𝑘

the distribution of the remuneration 𝑆𝑘, with k representing the various land uses . However, we should 
adopt a physical limit to the total area in region r, which will be ∑ 𝐻𝑘𝑥𝑘 = 0
, using the distribution of 
land in hectares 𝐻𝑘. Therefore, to maintain a constant total area, a physical variable in hectares, nkr, was 
used for each land use by region r and computed by: 

𝑘

𝑛𝑘𝑟 = 𝑥𝑘𝑟 + 𝜇                                                                                                               (2) 

𝑘

in which 𝜇 is calculated so that 0 = ∑ 𝐻𝑘𝑛𝑘
 to guarantee that the total physical supply of land will be 
fixed. Thus, the demand for land, according to the different uses, is connected to the land supply in the 
model. The idea is that the demand for land, 𝑥𝑘𝑟, influences the process of the conversion of land between 
the uses, that is, the supply side, 𝑛𝑘𝑟. In the REGIA model, this is operationalized upon determining that 
the variation of demand for land is equal to the variation of supply for land. This mechanism guarantees 
the equilibrium in the land market, fixing the total regional land available.  

The supply side of land will allow the factor to move between different categories of land between 
year t and year t + 1. A CET function could not capture the conversion process between the types of land 
uses. For this, the conversion process is controlled by a transition matrix representing the conversion 
possibilities of land between year t and year t + 1. The matrix represents the mobility of land between 
uses, indicating the possibilities of the transformation of different types of land. 

The transition matrix captures the fact that the most productive land is initially used in the 

production process, and at the same time, the use of marginal land that could be converted into productive 
use is limited. The economic process of land conversion is as follows: initially, forests would be 
converted into areas for pasture, which ultimately could be converted into areas for cropland (Ferreira 
Filho and Horridge, 2012; Cattaneo, 2002; Macedo et al., 2012; Barona et al., 2010). Therefore, the 
matrix shows that the conversion between uses, such as cropland and pasture, for example, is more easily 
performed than that for cropland directly from natural forests. If the difference between the amount of 
land used in agricultural production and the total area of the region is large, the rise in the demand for 
land will lead to the greater conversion of land for agricultural uses. This, in turn, will lead to an increase 
in the remuneration of land to offset the costs associated with this conversion. 

The transition matrix was built based on the methodology developed by Ferreira, Filho and 
Horridge (2014), and calibrated with satellite data from TerraClass13 2008 and 2010 (obtained from 

                                                           
11 Within each region, the area of “Cropland’, for example, in the current year is predetermined. However, the model allows a 
given area of “Cropland” to be re-allocated among crops according to a CET rule where CET = 0,5 (Ferreira Filho and Horridge, 
2014). 
12 i = 1 (rice), 2 (maize), 3 (wheat and cereals), 4 (sugar cane), 5 (soybeans), 6 (other crops), 7 (cassava), 8 (tobacco), 9 (upland 
cotton), 10 (citrus fruits), 11 (coffee beans), 12 (forestry and silviculture), 13 (cattle), 14 (milk and beef), 15 (pigs) 16 (birds) 
and 17 (eggs). Products 1 to 11 are linked in the model code to the cropland; good 12 is related to the use of planted forests and, 
finally, products 13 to 17 for pasture use. 
13 This article falls under the URBIS Amazonia project that discusses the influences of social and economic factors in the 
process of urbanization in the Amazon. This project was conducted by a multidisciplinary team led by the INPE, which 
provided the TerraClass data for the construction of the transition matrix to REGIA. See the following link to published papers

Prodes/INPE) along with data from the Agricultural Census for 1995 and 200614 (IBGE) for 30 regions in 
the Brazilian Amazon. The calibrated matrix indicates how land use changes between different types 
(cropland, pasture, planted forest and natural forest) over time. Between two periods (years), the model 
allows land to move between cropland, pasture, planted forest, or natural forest and to be converted into 
one of the three. The transition matrix15 for Amazon are illustrated in Chart 1. The sum of the lines 
represents the land use in year 2008, and the sum of the columns represents the land use in year 2010, 
which are values from TerraClass and the Agricultural Census database. The matrix was built using a bi-
proportional adjustment method, known as RAS16, of rows and columns scaling. The off-diagonal 
elements show the areas of land that have changed between the two periods.

Chart 1 shows in the first line and column that 5.0 of 5.9 million hectares, which was cropland in 
2008, remained as cropland in 2010 according to INPE data. The first column also shows that 2.3 of 44.5 
million hectares, which was pasture in 2008, converted to cropland in 2010. The last line shows the 
transformation of natural forest into other uses, which can be understood as deforestation. For example, 
4.3 million of hectares, which was natural forest in 2008, converted to pasture in 2010. And another 22.1 
million of hectares was converted from natural forest in 2008 into planted forest in 2010. 

The land supply in each category (cropland, pasture, planted forest and natural forest) for each 

region increases according to the annual percentage growth rate of each use given by the transition 
matrix: 

𝑁 𝑘, 𝑡 + 1 = 100 × ∆𝑁𝑘,(𝑡+1,𝑡)/𝑁𝑘,𝑡                                                                                   (3) 
In addition to this annual growth rate, to adjust the transition matrix for the next period, the 

current stock of land in year t is distributed for next year, t + 1, responding to changes in the remuneration 
of land. The transition matrix can be expressed as a percentage share (that is, the total sum of lines is 
equal to 1) showing the probability that a particular hectare of land used for pasture would be used the 
next year for cropland. In REGIA, these probabilities or proportions are modeled as a function of the 
variation in the remuneration of each type of land: 

                                                           
14  The data used to construct the transition matrix were given by TerraClass. However, because the data source for the sectoral 
output was from the IBGE, some adjustments had to be made using the Agricultural Census data because some sectors had 
production according to IBGE data, but did not have output according to data from TerraClass. This adjustment was minimal 
and represented less than 10% of the land-use data. The option for TerraClass data is explained by the quality of information 
from satellite data compared to Census data, which is based on farmers’ responses.  
15 The transition matrix assumes that natural forests would be initially converted into areas for pasture and that after some time 
would be able to be converted into areas for crops. We built a transition matrix for the 30 regions in Amazon and for the rest of 
Brazil. 
16 The RAS method is an interactive mechanism that seeks to adjust the values of the rows and columns of a matrix, with its 
total considering the proportionality of the total values. This method calculates a new set of values for a matrix of cells from a 
previous structure, causing the sum of the rows and columns to be consistent with the expected total. More information about 
the RAS method can be found in Miller and Blair (2009).

The sensitivity parameter, 𝛽𝑙𝑛𝑑, represents the elasticity of land supply and was calculated 

according to Van Meijl et al. (2006) and Farias (2012). The elasticity of land supply with respect to land 
price changes should reflect the notion that greater land availability is related to higher values of 
elasticity. We can see the elasticity by region in Table I. A greater availability of land implies an easier 
process of land conversion in terms of costs. Thus, if the remuneration of cropland increases in relation to 
the remuneration of pasture in year t (demand side), the rate of conversion from pasture to cropland will 
increase, and thus, the amount of land devoted to cropland in t + 1 also increases. To model the 
conversion rate of natural forests, it was necessary to consider a fictitious remuneration, in this case, the 
Final User Price Index. Thus, the transition matrix is adjusted annually as is the supply of land.

2.3 The Database 

 

The database for the REGIA model was constructed through a process of regionalization of a 

national input-output matrix. The procedure was based on the methodology developed by Horridge 
(2006) and was adapted for the Brazilian case. Basically, from input-output data for 2005 and a large set 
of regional data, we estimated an interregional trade matrix using a distance matrix and a gravitational 
approach. The main hypothesis of the gravitational approach17 is that interregional trade is based on the 
distance between the regions and the interaction derived from the size of its economies. 

Details of the procedure for building a database for REGIA are in Carvalho (2014). The result of 
this procedure is a consistency of the database with the official data of National Accounts, Input-Output 

                                                           
17 A widespread theoretical justification for the idea that bilateral trade flows are positively associated with regional incomes 
and negatively with the distance between them is based on a trade model developed by Krugman (1980). Further details about 
the method and some applications can be found in Miller and Blair (2009).

remuneration of land by region in the Amazon. In the model, land remuneration was allocated to the 
agricultural and livestock sectors. The land remuneration was obtained from the data of the "Expenditure 
incurred by establishments - from Leasing" of the 2006 Agricultural Census (IBGE)18.

Model closure is the determination of sets of endogenous and exogenous variables in simulations. 
This closure represents hypotheses about the economy and its adjustments to shocks (policies). REGIA is 
a dynamic model and allows for the accumulation of capital over time as well as adjustments to the land 

                                                           
18 The division of this information between livestock and agriculture was taken in accordance with the lease of land values  by 
activity groups. For example, for agriculture, the rental values of the groups were combined, such as the temporary crop output, 
horticulture  and  floriculture,  permanent  crops  output,  seeds,  seedlings  and  other  forms  of  plant  propagation  and  forestry 
production.  For  livestock,  the  rental  values  of  the  groups  were  also  combined,  such  as  livestock  and  keeping  other  animals, 
fisheries and aquaculture. Because the model’s database comes from 2005, a deflator was applied to the monetary values of the 
Agricultural Census to be equal to the input-output matrix. Thus, we obtained the national land remuneration for agriculture and 
livestock. The last step was to divide the remuneration of land by region, given that the value of it is proportional to the production 
of agriculture and livestock in each region.

market. The three closures used for the simulations are: i) historical closure, ii) baseline closure and iii) 
policy closure. 

At first, there is a historical closure, from 2006 to 2011 to update macroeconomic variables 

according to IBGE data. In this case, the main national aggregates are considered to be exogenous, such 
as real GDP, investment, household consumption, government expenditure, exports and aggregate 
employment. Thus, other variables, such as the gross rate of return, national wage, government demand, 
exported volume, national propensity to consume, as well as technological change variable are 
endogenous. In this case, the model calculates how these variables accommodate the national aggregates. 
Another assumption is that regional areas for “natural forests and other uses” are exogenous to the 
deforestation rates from 2006 to 2011 according to INPE data.  

At baseline from 2012 to 2030, the macroeconomic variables for the aggregate GDP, household 

consumption and government expenditure are still exogenous and the regional deforestation rates become 
endogenous. It is assumed that regional consumption follows the regional income and the government 
expenditure follows the income of households regionally. Labor moves between regions and activities, 
driven by real wages changes. The model works with relative prices, and the Consumer Price Index was 
chosen as a numeraire.  "Natural forests and other uses" is exogenous only for regions in the model that 
do not comprise tropical forests and where the capacity for agricultural expansion through deforestation is 
small. In REGIA, this group is formed by Sudeste Matogrossense, Centro-Sul Matogrossense, Sul 
Maranhense, Leste Maranhense, Oriental de Tocantins and the rest of Brazil.  

In the policy scenario, each macroeconomic variable is endogenous, with the aggregate national 
employment set exogenously. That is, aggregate employment is fixed relative to baseline, and labor can 
move regionally. It is assumed that national consumption follows the GDP with endogenous national 
propensity to consume. And the national total is distributed between regions in proportion to labor 
income. The government expenditure follows the income of households regionally and nationally. A 
restriction is imposed on the national balance of trade that determines its exogenous participation in the 
national GDP, which does not restrict the possibilities of adjusting to the balance of trade for each region 
individually. 

3.2 Simulations 

The baseline shows the 3% per year growth of the national economy for the period from 2012 to 
2030 and represents the projection that is compared to the policy scenario19. Thus, real GDP, household 
consumption and government expenditure are expected to grow at 3% per year, while population growth 
is set at 1% per year. In addition to these variables, projections of soybean and cattle exports demand 
were taken from Nassar (2011) consistent with FAO (2003)20 projections. The reason for using projection 
of exports demand for soybeans and cattle is based on the fact that the export market for these products is 
considered to be an important determinant of deforestation in the region. Soybean and cattle exports 
demand were projected to increase by 4.25% and 2.01%, respectively, representing a total increase of 
130% in soybean exports demand and 49% in cattle exports demand by 2030. 

The aim of the policy scenario is to represent the deforestation control policy proposed in the 

PNMC (2008), projecting the impact of an 80% reduction in deforestation by 2020 and a 100% reduction 
from 2021 to 2030, which means achieving zero deforestation in regions of the Brazilian Amazon. In 
REGIA, the control of deforestation in the Amazon implies limiting the expansion of the land factor for 
productive uses in agriculture. In general, the restriction on land supply will reduce the possibility of 
converting natural forest areas into other productive uses, such as cropland, pasture and planted forest. 
The initial impact of limit land supply is an increase in the remuneration of land with negative economic 
impacts because of the rise in the production cost of agricultural goods. This will directly decrease the 
activity level in the agricultural sector and indirectly decrease the activity level in other sectors. 

                                                           
19 For more details on the baseline scenario, see Carvalho (2014). 
20 Brazil is modelled as a small open economy and the shock in the simulation was given in the variable “Export quantity 
shift”.  

10 

 

Moreover, limiting deforestation tend to engender more intense impacts on regions where the economy is 
based more on agricultural activities. 

Another effect induced by the simulation is that a more expensive factor (land) encourages a shift 

towards other primary factors (capital and labor). Even with the replacement from land to labor and 
capital, there may be a reduction in employment and investment if the activity effect (declining output) is 
stronger than the substitution effect (between land, labor and capital). The increase in prices of all goods 
and the drop in employment levels may have the effect of reducing household consumption. Because the 
model is interregional, restricting deforestation also reallocates output toward least affected areas. These 
impacts are consistently designed by REGIA, which takes into account the regional interdependence. This 
spillover effect of policies is an important feature of regional economies in Brazil. 

The reduction in land supply also has an effect on exports. The increase in the domestic prices of 
goods in all regions makes the exported products relatively more expensive than imported goods. Hence, 
the most affected regions are those where the economy is primarily aimed at agro-exported activities. In 
summary, the net effect of the direct and indirect causalities will drive the impact on the activity level of 
each region, and this effect is determined by the characteristics, as the regional trade integration and 
production structures. 

Finally, the last simulation aims to identify the gains in land productivity that would offset the 
adverse economic effects of the simulated policy of deforestation in the Amazon. The idea behind this 
simulation is that economic agents or related public policies may respond to deforestation control by 
modifying the agricultural techniques and livestock to mitigate the constraints imposed by controlling 
deforestation. 

4.  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS 

4.1 Regional Macroeconomic Results 

The policy results presented here are reported as the cumulative percentage deviation (2012-2030) 
relative to the baseline scenario. Table III presents the results for the major macroeconomic indicators by 
region. In general, the impact of the policy to control deforestation does not seem to be excessive. The six 
regions with major negative impacts on GDP were Norte Matogrossense (-3.6%), Nordeste 
Matogrossense (-3%), Sudoeste Matogrossense (-2.1%), Marajó, Baixo Amazonas and Leste 
Rondoniense (approximately - 1.7% each). Considering the Norte Matogrossense, for example, the 
interpretation of these results is that this region would attain a cumulative growth 3.6% lower than that 
obtained in a scenario without the policy (the baseline scenario). 

This greater impact on the Norte and Nordeste Matogrossense is explained in part because these 

regions have the highest shares of land remuneration on GDP of the entire Amazon. Moreover, 
agriculture accounts for over 50% of the total production in these regions. The decline in GDP in Norte 
Matogrossense is a significant result because it is one of the largest regions in the Amazon and is 
especially important in soybean and cattle production - two sectors directly affected by the policy. The 
Sudeste Matogrossense, Baixo Amazonas and Leste Rondoniense regions are economies based on 
agricultural activities, which represents over 50% of the total production in each of them, explaining the 
negative impact. 

The silviculture and forestry activity accounts for more than 50% of all of the production in 

Marajo, with another 30% distributed among agriculture sectors. This high share of agricultural 
production and forestry makes this region one of the most affected by the policy. Also noteworthy is that 
the decline in investment and household consumption were major drivers of the decrease in GDP in these 
regions. The Leste Rondoniense also suffered a greater decline in GDP, which is a significant result 
because the region is an important producer of cattle, accounting for over 13% of cattle in the Amazon. 

As expected, the regions that would be less affected by the policy are those that do not have areas 

of natural forests to be converted into productive use. Some of these regions, such as Sul Maranhense, 
Sudeste Matogrossense, Oriental de Tocantins and the rest of Brazil, even present a small gain in GDP 
(0.35%, 0.20%, 0.12% and 0.06%, respectively). This result can be explained by the dynamics of the 

 

labor and capital market. Employment will increase in regions less affected by the policy, which will then 
lead to lower cost increases. Thus, these regions showed small gains in GDP due to interregional 
migration causing a drop in real wages that then benefits the other regions.

           Source: Elaborated by the authors based on simulation results from the REGIA model 
 

This simulated policy represents a direct increase in the costs of agricultural production - the main 

economic activity of most regions in the Amazon also reduces exports. The increase in the production 
costs that is passed on to the final prices of goods makes local production relatively more expensive than 
the imported goods and discourages exports. Likewise, the effect of the drop in activity also reduces 
imports. As the regions cannot convert more land into productive use, they seek to replace the land factor 
with labor and capital. This suppresses the investment/capital ratio, promoting a decline in investment due 
to low rates of return. Employment also decreases, which suggests that the activity effect (decrease in 
GDP) is greater than the substitution effect (among the primary factors). The fall in employment leads to 
a consequent reduction in household income and consumption, which is an indication that the policy 
causes a loss of welfare. 

4.2 Sectoral Results  

The policy, as it restricts the possibilities of converting forests into productive agricultural use, has 
a negative impact mainly on the agricultural sectors. Soybean production is important in the Amazon and 
accounts for approximately 35% of national soybean production. Of all of the soybeans produced in the 

 

Amazon, nearly 60% are from the Norte Matogrossense, followed by Sudeste and Nordeste 
Matogrossense, which together produce over 25% of the total soybeans. Soybean production is 
considered to be one of the main drivers of deforestation, so the negative impact was expected. Figure 1 
shows the impact of the policy on the soybean and cattle sectors.

Control Deforestation (accumulated deviation from 2012 to 2030 relative to baseline)

We note in Figure 1 that the number of regions in the database that present no impact are not 

soybean producers or the soybean production is virtually zero. Both the Norte and Nordeste 
Matogrossense are among the regions most affected by the policy. As expected, the Sudeste 
Matogrossense would benefit from the policy because it lies outside its scope. In general, production 
costs increase more in regions that are targets of the policy to control deforestation. This implies that in 
regions where there are greater production costs impacts21, the drop in activity level will be greater as 
well. In particular, soybean production is the sector with the greatest variations in production costs (one 
of the most modern agriculture production in Brazil). 

Cattle production, one of the main drivers of deforestation, is also an important sector in the 
Amazon and accounts for almost 30% of national production. Its production is concentrated in Leste 
Rondoniense, Sudeste Paraense, Norte and Sudoeste Matogrossense. We can observe from Figure 2 that 
the regions where cattle production is concentrated are among the most adversely affected by the policy. 
Cattle activity is also considered to be an important driver of deforestation in the region but shows lower 
cost increases than soybeans. This is because the remuneration of land in pasture areas is significantly 
lower than in croplands in the Amazon. 

Table VI presents the sectoral results with an aggregation of the 27 sectors into 6 major industries. 

Because of the free movement of goods and factors within the Brazilian economy, the region “rest of 
Brazil” shows a positive impact in all industries. However, regions as Centro-Sul Matogrossense, Sul and 
Leste Maranhense, Oriental and Ocidental of Tocantins, even if they do not have areas of natural forests 
to be converted into productive use, presented a decline in production of many industries. This is because 
of the strong commercial relationship between regions inside Amazon. And because of the linkage 
between the sectors, Industries, Services and Public Administration Sectors present also a decline in its 
production, even if they are not affected directly by the restriction of land. In general, the results suggest 
that the largest sectoral negative impact occurs mainly on important agricultural regions such as Norte, 
Nordeste and Sudeste Matogrossense, and Leste Rondoniense and on regions dominated by small family 
farms such as Vale Acre and Baixo Amazonas.

4.3 Land-Use Results 

Figure 2 shows the projection of land use in the Amazon in the policy to control deforestation 

scenario. Given the reduction goal (limiting the land use), aggregate deforestation in the Amazon would 
decline over time which means an avoided deforestation relative to the baseline. This can be seen in the 
upward trend in the natural forest area, which is projected to increase to 14.56 million hectares in 2030 
relative to the baseline scenario. Because the total area of the region is fixed, the growth of a particular 
land use must be accompanied by a reduction in another land use. Thus, we note that reducing 
deforestation is only possible by the reduction of cropland, pasture and planted forest relative to the 
baseline. In this instance, a reduction in these areas means that in the economic growth scenario (baseline) 
there would be less conversion of natural forests (deforestation) into these areas. 

Because land conversion as established in the REGIA assumes that areas of natural forest are first 
converted into pasture, pasture areas would suffer the greatest reductions because of the limited growth of 
land supply. Therefore, these areas would decrease by approximately nine million hectares compared to 
the baseline scenario. Then, the crop areas and planted forest areas would present a decline in response to 
the deforestation control policy. The first would have a reduction in area of about four million hectares, 
while the planted forest areas would be reduced by about two million hectares in 2012-2030 relative to 
the baseline scenario of economic growth.

Table V presents the results for different types of land use (in millions of hectares) by region. The 

policy increases the amount of land allocated for natural forest. Furthermore, we can note that the Norte 
Matogrossense and Sudeste Paraense would be the regions with the largest preserved areas (in hectares). 
Regarding the crop area, the regions with the greatest reductions in hectares would be Nordeste 
Matogrossense, Nordeste Paraense, Baixo Amazonas and Vale do Acre. These regions have agricultural 
goods/sectors in common as the most important activities in their production structures. In these regions, 
the policy to control deforestation would cause a more severe drop in agricultural production, explaining 
the greatest reduction in cropland.

The pasture area in millions of hectares would be reduced more than the cropland area in most of 

the Amazon regions. The explanation for this greater reduction in pasture lies in the fact that the model 
assumes that the conversion of forest areas first occurs towards the pasture area. As such, the Sudeste and 
Sudoeste Paraense, Norte and Nordeste Matogrossense, and Leste Rondoniense would have the largest 
reductions in pasture area. This result is explained by the productive structure of these regions, which are

important producers of cattle in the Amazon. In general, we observe that regions with more natural forest 
areas would be most affected by the policy to control deforestation and would show greater variation 
(decline) in its areas for productive use as well as a greater increase in production costs. 

In terms of planted forest areas, it can be seen in Table IV that the reduction in these areas is of 

less magnitude than it is for other uses. This result indicates that the increase in production costs for this 
type of land is relatively smaller than for the others. However, we can highlight the reduction in planted 
forest area in Sudeste Paraense and Baixo Amazonas. The Sudeste Paraense is the largest forestry 
producer in the Amazon, and Baixo Amazonas also has a concentrated production in this sector. 

 
4.4 Land productivity response to policy 

In the simulations with the REGIA model, we have assumed that the policy to control 

deforestation occurs during the period from 2012 to 2030. Thus, this section aim to show how land 
productivity would have to increase in the same period to offset the impacts on regional outputs caused by 
the limited supply of land. In the baseline scenario, it is assumed that the productivity of land increases by 
1% per year from 2012 to 2030. There is also an increase in the overall productivity of the primary factors 
of 0.7% per year in the same period. Therefore, the results reported in this section should be understood 
as an additional increase in productivity considering the baseline scenario. Table VI presents the regional 
results of the rise in productivity for the main agricultural sectors in the REGIA model that would offset 
the negative impacts in the regions due to the deforestation policy.

We notice, on average, that the annual productivity of the land should grow at approximately 1% 

per year so that the policy to control deforestation would not cause any negative impact on production. 
According Gasques et al. (2008), the productivity of land in Brazil grew by 3.26% per year from 2000 to 

16 

 

2005, which suggests that this rate would be possible even in the Amazon. For example, to achieve the 
given results, the land productivity gains would have to be 0.5% to 1.4% per year compared to the 
baseline scenario to neutralize the effect of controlling deforestation. This would correspond to an 
increase in productivity of approximately 2.2% to 3.1% per year, including the increased productivity per 
year in the baseline scenario.  

 

5.  CONCLUSIONS 

The main goal of this paper was to analyze the dynamics of land use and impacts of a policy to 

control deforestation, seeking to contribute to an analysis of different scenarios in the Amazon. For this, 
we built an interregional dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model called REGIA, which 
incorporates a model of land use known as ILUC (indirect land-use change). 

First, a baseline scenario was built to project economic growth by region in a business-as-usual 

situation without a policy to control deforestation. In this scenario, the Amazon regions are stimulated by 
the growth of the national economy and the increasing demand to export soybeans and cattle. Related to 
this scenario, we simulated a policy to control deforestation that aims to reduce deforestation by 80% by 
2020, followed by a reduction target of 100% for the period from 2021 to 2030. The increase in land 
productivity required to offset the negative impacts of the deforestation control policy was also projected. 
Overall, the results indicated that the regions most affected by the policy follow two distinct patterns: i) 
regions in the deforestation arc in Mato Grosso and Rondonia and ii) regions outside the arc that have a 
smaller share in the total GDP of the Amazon, in Amazonas and Para. According to the data and 
mechanisms of the model, the former are more negatively affected by having a higher remuneration of 
land and being more productive. Thus restricting the supply of land would generate higher losses of 
production per hectare. The regions outside of the arc have lower productivity, and often the growth of 
their production is linked to the expansion of land (low remuneration), which then leads to the greater 
negative impact in these regions. 

However, in general, the results showed that the costs of a policy to control deforestation in the 

Amazon are relatively small, although its distribution is heterogeneous between regions, particularly 
affecting the regions that are most dependent on agriculture and have low productivity. It was also 
observed that the agriculture intensification in the Amazon can be considered to be a viable alternative for 
the maintenance of the production, employment, income and consumption in the region. 

The results from simulated land productivity response suggest that the required annual gain would 

be approximately 1.4% for cropland, 1.3% for pasture and 1.4% for planted forest. These results are in 
addition to the increase in productivity for the land factor and the primary factors that is considered in the 
baseline scenario, which is approximately 1.7% per year. The Amazon has a large cleared area that is 
underutilized (IMAZON, 2013), and the productivity of land in Brazil grew by 3.26% per year, on 
average, from 2000 to 2005 (GASQUES et al., 2008). Thus, the results of productivity gains found with 
the REGIA model seem feasible and could be achieved through incentive policies targeting primary crops 
and livestock in each region. 

According to other studies on this theme, the increased land productivity alone does not seem to 
hold the expansion of crop areas. The increase in productivity can generate an incentive for producers to 
add cultivated areas for further expansion of production. Thus, there must be a policy to control 
deforestation coupled with increasing land productivity. Thus, the government should exercise greater 
surveillance to curb illegal deforestation and, at the same time, promote economic incentives toward 
forest conservation. These incentives can be provided with forest concessions for sustainable forest 
management, payment for environmental services that highlight the payments of REDDs or even the 
promotion of programs aimed to increase the productivity of deforested land in the Amazon. 

A limitation of the methodology employed in this paper is that the issue of proximity between 
regions has no role in the expansion of agricultural crops or livestock. The model only allows for the 
expansion of crops in regions where this production already exists in the database, and largely, only the 
economic conditions of the region influence its expansion. That is, the model does not work properly with 

17 

 

the issue of expansion of the agricultural frontier, but with the local expansion of activities influenced by 
competitive market mechanisms. This is also due to the choice of the regional disaggregation of the 
model.
