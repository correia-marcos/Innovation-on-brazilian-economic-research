Abstract 

We  investigate  how  intimate  partner  violence  (IPV)  affects  children  school  outcomes:  school 
enrollment,  school  delay,  and  drop-out.  To  achieve  this,  data  from  victimization  survey  jointly 
conducted with the 2009 Brazilian Household Sample Survey were used. We applied the propensity 
score  matching  method  to  compare  the  outcomes  of  witnesses  and  non-witnesses  of  mother's 
intimate  partner  violence.  We  found  evidence  that  IPV  is  positively  correlated  with  drop-out  and 
school  delay,  and  negatively  correlated  to  school  exposure  and  years  of  schooling.  Moreover,  we 
found that the exposure to mother's IPV is correlated to a higher likelihood of being assaulted.

Resumo 

O  objetivo  deste  artigo  é  investigar  o  impacto  da  violência  por  parceiro  íntimo  (IPV)  no 
desempenho escolar das crianças, medido por: matrícula, atraso, e abandono escolar. Usamos dados 
da  pesquisa  de  vitimização  realizada  como  suplemento  especial  da  PNAD  2009.  Aplicou-se  o 
método de pareamento para comparar os resultados de testemunhas e não testemunhas de violência 
por parceiro íntimo contra a mãe. Encontramos evidência que  IPV é positivamente correlacionada 
com abandono e atraso escolar, e negativamente correlacionada com os anos de escolaridade. Além 
disso,  observamos  que  a  exposição  à  IPV  da  mãe  é  correlacionada  com  o  maior  risco  de  sofrer 
violência.

1.  Introduction 

 
The  literature  about  violence  against  women  points  out  to  intimate  partner  violence 
(henceforth,  IPV)  as  one  of  the  most  common  forms  of  violence  affecting  women  from  different 
countries  and  socioeconomic  status  (Thompson  et  al.,  1999;  Garcia-Moreno  et  al.,  2006; 
Friedemann-Sánchez  and  Lovatón,  2012).  Although  it  is  not  clear  why  women  are  caught  up  in 
abusive relationships, they are mostly in poverty and other disadvantaged socioeconomic situations 
(Koenig  et  al.,  2006;  Dunkle  et  al.,  2004;  Naved  and  Persson,  2005).  Consequences  of  domestic 
violence  are  known  to  be  always  negative  not  only  for  abused  women,  but  also  for  their  children 
and other family members (Durand et al., 2011; Heaton and Forste, 2008; Wathen and MacMillan, 
2013; Kimball, 2016).

Most  of  the  previous  studies  about  the  effects  the  IPV  on  children  were  concerned  with 
health and psychological issues. Results indicated that children who witness domestic violence are 
more  likely  to  develop  behavioral  and  cognitive  problems  as  an  indirect  consequence  (Edleson, 
1999;  Kernic et  al.,  2002;  Gewirtz and Edleson, 2007;  Durand et  al.,  2011;  Carlson, 2000). Other 
studies focused on the effects of domestic violence on children's educational outcomes  (Durand et 
al., 2011; Heaton and Forste, 2008; Wathen and MacMillan, 2013; Kimball, 2016). 
 
Domestic violence, especially intimate partner violence, should receive more attention from 
development  agendas  worldwide,  as  a  channel  to  reduce  poverty  and  gender  inequality,  and 
improve the public health (Friedemann-Sánchez and Lovatón, 2012). 
In  Brazil,  Federal  Law  nº  11,340  of  August  7,  2006,  popularly  known  as  the  Maria  da 
 
Penha Act,  created mechanisms to  deter domestic and family violence against women. Moreover, 
the  law  seeks  to  eradicate  discrimination  against  women.  This  law  has  made  violence  and  family 
violence against women a serious crime. Moreover, to enforce this law a police system was created 
to ensure better procedures to attend victimized women. 
In 2009, the Brazilian Ministry of Health introduced the Information System on Diseases of 
 
Compulsory Declaration (SINAN, in Brazilian acronym), where reported violence against children, 
adolescents, women and elderly are compulsorily recorded. Only in the first year, 107,572 cases of 
domestic,  sexual  and  other  types  of  violence  were  reported.  About  64.5%  of  total  victimizations 
were  violence  against  women  (CNJ,  2013).  It  should  be  noted  that  SINAN  data,  and  any  record 
regarding domestic violence, are underreported because most victims seek medical assistance only 
when the situation is unbearable, and the harms are clear for the other people. 
 
According to CNJ (2013), violence against women occurs mostly in the victim's household. 
Also,  there  is  a  “generational  transmission”  of  violence  which  follows  the  victim's  age.  For  those 
under  9  years  old,  the  father  is  commonly  the  main  aggressor;  for  women  aged  15-59,  the 
perpetrators are mostly intimate partners and ex-partners; for those over age 60, in general, the sons 
are the aggressors. 

Accordingly,  2009  National  Household  Sample  Survey  (PNAD  in  Brazilian  acronym) 
dataset  shows that 2.5 million Brazilians aged 10 and  above were assaulted in  the  year before the 
survey.  In  12.2%  of  these  cases,  the  perpetrator  was  an  intimate  partner  or  ex-partner.  Moreover, 
90%  of  IPV  victims  were  female  (279,964  women),  and  82%  of  the  aggression  took  place  in  the 
household, while 9% occurred in public places and 7% in other persons' households. 

In  2009,  there  were  34.8  million  boys  and  girls  living  with  their  mothers  within  the  age 
range  of  6-17.  Although  less  than  1%  witnessed  domestic  violence,  it  represented  more  than  235 
thousand  children  who  were  indirect  victims  of  early  psychosocial  distress  as  a  result  of  family 
violence. 
 
Given this scenario, using Brazilian 2009 victimization and PNAD data, this paper aims to 
investigate  how  witnessing  IPV  affects  children’s  school  outcomes:  school  enrollment,  school 
delay, and dropout. From these mentioned surveys, it is possible to know about victimization status 
as well as details about the aggressors and also know the local where the violence occurred.  
 
For  our  empirical  analysis,  we  used  a  filtered  sample  made  up  of  the  Brazilian  population 
aged 6-17 living in  the  mother’s household.4 This  procedure is  based on  Assaad et  al.  (2016).  An 
additional exercise is performed to investigate the effect on years of schooling and school exposure 
for  those  older  than  9,  and  we  estimated  the  victimization  risk  for  assault  conditional  to  children 
witnessing  mother's  IPV.  The  propensity  score  matching  method  was  applied  to  compare  the 
outcomes of witnesses and non-witnesses of mother's intimate partner violence. This procedure was 
used to reduce problems of endogeneity, since no robust instrument is available in the dataset that 
was used. Therefore, unlike previous studies (Emery, 2011; Assaad et al., 2016; Fakir et al., 2016), 

                                                           
4  Throughout  the  paper,  the  terms  “children”  and  “youth”  will  be  are  interchangeably  used  for  the  individuals  6-17 
aged. Even though the older ones would not accept the label, it refers to a person who is dependent on adults to make 
decisions.

we do not establish a causal relationship between IPV and children school outcomes.  Despite this 
limitation, our results for Brazil corroborate with the previous evidence found from other countries. 
 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the details about the data, 
filtered  sample  and  empirical  strategy;  Section  3  presents  the  main  results  and  robustness  checks; 
Section 4 concludes the paper, where we recognize the limitation of our empirical findings. 
 
2.  Method 

A. Data and sample 

 
We  use  a  cross-section  dataset  from  the  2009  National  Household  Survey  (PNAD,  in  the 
Portuguese  acronym)  and  its  special  supplement  on  public  safety,  carried  out  by  the  Brazilian 
Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE, in the Portuguese acronym).  
 
The  PNAD  is  a  multipurpose  random  household  survey  that  investigates  several 
socioeconomic  characteristics  of  the  population,  some  on  a  permanent  basis  and  others  with 
variable  periodicity,  such  as  victimization  characteristics.  An  interesting  advantage  of  the  PNAD 
lies in its national coverage. In addition, given that the survey collects data on many other variables 
related  to  household  structure  and  socioeconomic  aspects  of  household  members  (income,  labor, 
education,  housing  characteristics,  age,  etc.),  it  is  possible  to  associate  these  variables  with  crime 
victimization.  The  victimization  question  about  physical  assault  is  translated  thusly:  “Were  you  a 
victim of physical assault between September 27, 2008 and September 26, 2009?” 
 
In  2009  PNAD,  399,387  people  from  153,837  households  in  all  Brazilian  states  were 
surveyed. However, the questions on victimization were only applied to people aged 10 and above 
(n  =  337,510).  Regarding  victimization  characteristics,  we  clarify  that:  a)  reference  period  is  365 
days (from September 27, 2008, to September 26, 2009), and b) information was provided by only 
one  person  in  each  household,  who  reported  cases  of  victimization  experienced  personally  or  by 
other members of the household aged 10 or over at the time of the survey 
 
To  make  the  dataset  suitable  for  empirical  modeling  the  filtered  sample  is  centered  on  the 
nuclear family, i.e., domestic servants and their relatives were excluded. In fact, we selected family 
members  classified  as  daughter  or  son  to  find  observational  units,  family  head,  and  spouses  for 
mothers and fathers. Our observational units are children and youth within the age bracket of 6-17 – 
considered school age in Brazil, including high school level – living with their mothers.5 After these 
filters,  we  retained  75,111  individuals  in  the  targeted  age  and  family  status  group.  We  then  kept 
only  those  whose  mother  was  alive  and  living  in  the  same  household,  ending  up  with  73,386 
observations. From this, 1.7% (or 539 individuals) witnessed intimate partner violence against their 
mothers. Also, we found 23,843 observations from  children under age 10 who did  not  answer the 
victimization  questionnaire.  Missing  values  in  explanatory  variables  led  to  a  loss  of  observations, 
reducing  the  final  filtered  sample  to  72,697  observations  for  drop-out  estimates  and  49,240 
observations for school exposure estimates. 
 
B. Estimator and variables 

 
Our  objective  is  to  compare  educational  outcomes  of  IPV  witnesses  and  not  witnesses. 
However, 2009 PNAD only provides information regarding school enrollment and grade level, but 
not attendance or academic performance. Therefore, we examine the following measures: 1) school 
enrollment: whether or not children are enrolled in the formal school system; 2) drop out: whether 
or  not  children  are  out  of  school  but  was  enrolled  before;  3)  school  delay:  used  to  assess  school 

                                                           
5  School  enrollment  is  mandatory  in  Brazil  for  first  to  ninth  grades  (children  aged  6  to  14)  since  2006.  High  school 
(ages 15-17) and pre-school enrollments (ages 4-5) are mandatory since 2009. Nevertheless, the school system had until 
2016 to complete the transition for pre-school and high school levels (BRASIL, 2009), and the reference period of our 
dataset is the third week of September 2009.

performance, indicates if the student is attending the school  grade expected for his or her age;6 4) 
years of schooling: degree completion for children older than 9;  and 5) school exposure:  years of 
schooling with respect to children’s age, also for those older than 9. 
 
We also examine whether or not children themselves were violence victims in the previous 
year. The variable assault accounts for children who reported assault and whoever was the offender, 
such as the parents,  other relatives, friends, acquaintances or unknown people.  It  is  worthwhile to 
highlight that we focus on the broader aspects of violence in children’s routine  – e.g., naturalizing 
violent behavior, as pointed out by Carlson (2000) and Carpenter and Stacks (2009) – IPV parents 
are  more  likely  to  use  physical  punishment  as  educational  strategy  (Harne  and  Radford,  2008). 
Hence,  this  measure  may  reflect  the  family  dynamics  where  violence  is  natural,  more  than  the 
children’s propensity to victimization afterward. 
 
For  our  primary  purpose,  we  applied  the  propensity  score  matching  method  (henceforth 
PMS), to  compare the outcomes of witnesses  and non-witnesses of mother’s  IPV. The first  group 
(witnesses  of  mother's  IPV)  is  defined  as  the  “treatment  group”,  and  the  second  group  (non-
witnesses of mother's IPV) is defined as the “control group”. The ultimate strength of PSM is that 
we can create treatment and control groups in its first stage based on observable variables, and then 
compare the groups' interest variables using means test in its second stage.  
 
To create treatment and control groups, we estimate the probability of being treated, based 
on observable covariates, using logit or probit estimators. We then match observation units based on 
their  likelihood  of  being  treated,  thus  reaching  treatment  and  control  groups.  Conditional  on  a 
specific set of hypothesis, the groups obtained resembles those who would arise with an experiment. 
It  is  possible  to  show,  for  example,  that  both  groups  are  similar  in  observables,  avoiding 
confoundedness  in  the  estimation.  We  then  can  perform  means  tests  to  compare  outcomes  of 
treatment and control groups -- the PSM second stage -- and attribute differences to the treatment. 
For  details  about  PMS  see  Rubin  (1973),  LaLonde  (1986),  Rosenbaum  (1995),  Heckman  et  al. 
(1998), and Dehejia and Wahba (2002). 
In our empirical exercise, the first stage of PSM consists of the estimation of the likelihood 
 
of IPV using the logit regression, where the observation unit is the woman. The dependent variable 
is a dummy that assumes the value 1 if the woman was assaulted by her partner or ex-partner and 0 
otherwise. 
We assigned an indicator variable for IPV if the woman answered that she was assaulted in 
 
the last  year, and that the aggressor was a current  or former intimate partner (husband, boyfriend, 
dating  partner  etc).  Therefore,  we  named  IPV  witnesses  those  children  and  youth  living  with  a 
mother who said was an IPV victim in the last twelve months. 
Finally,  the  control  variables  in  the  logit  regression,  based  on  Friedemann-Sánchez  and 
 
Lovatón (2012) and Assaad et al. (2016), are: a) mother’s age and schooling (years of education), b) 
dummy  for  white  skin  color  (against  non-white),  c)  dummy  for  reference  person,  d)  dummy  for 
labor market participation, e) dummy for welfare program beneficiary, f) dummy for living with a 
partner, g) dummy for being formally married, h) family size, i) dummy for have a mobile phone, j) 
dummy for access to the internet, k) dummies for wealth quintiles, l) dummy for urban residence, 
and m) dummies for geographic regions.  
Table  1  provides  a  complete  description  of  the  variables,  along  with  their  means  and 
 
stardard deviations for the entire sample, i.e., for the witnesses and non-witnesses of mother’s IPV. 
Data analysis and econometric procedures are all unweighted – following duMouchel and Duncan, 
(1983),  Lohr  and  Liu  (1994)  and  Korn  and  Graubard  (1995)  discussion  about  regressions’ 
weighting.

We obtain all the PSM and its variance estimates and performed the usual balance tests on 
covariates by using the same procedures that was used in Garrido et al., (2014). The Stata integrated 
code  “teffects”  and  the  user-written  module  “psmatch2”  (Leuven  and  Sianesi,  2012)  for  Stata  14 
were used.

3.  Results 

A. Descriptive analysis 

 
Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for both samples of children that were exposed and not-
exposed to  IPV. This table provides the results from two-group mean-comparison and proportion-
comparison tests performed to all covariates. 

Regarding  mother's  variables,  our  data  suggests  a  possible  relationship  between  women 
facing worse living conditions and IPV. For example, when compared to no IPV mothers, mothers 
who  experienced  an  IPV  have  lower  income  (R$  421  versus  R$  652),  less  education  (6  versus  7 
years  of  schooling),  less  literacy  (93%  versus  90%)  and  despite  having  higher  labor  force 
participation rates (73% versus 69%) are less likely to be employed (80% versus 90%). While 54% 
of  mothers  that  experienced  an  IPV  seem  to  receive  governmental  aid  –  like  Bolsa  Família 
Program,  this  figure  is  about  35%  in  the  group  composed  of  mothers  who  did  not  experience  an 
IPV. 
 
IPV mothers are younger than no IPV mothers (35 versus 37 years old), most are non-white 
(69% versus 60%), more likely to be single (56 versus 30%) and – as a consequence – more likely 
to be the household head (75% versus 33%).  
 
Table 2 also shows that families are made up of 4-5 members and there is a higher incidence 
of  children  living  with  their  father  (or  their  mother's  spouse)  among  those  not  exposed  to  IPV. 
Notwithstanding,  children  exposed  to  their  mother’s  IPV  are  mostly  within  the  lower  wealth 
quintiles7. 
The last set of variables is related to children outcomes. All differences are statistically significant 
at  the  1%  level.  We  can  interpret  these  differences  between  groups  as  the  unconditional  effect  of 
being  exposed  to  mother's  IPV.  Thus,  children  and  youths  living  with  abused  mothers  are  more 
likely  to  be  assaulted  in  12  percentage  points  (p.p.);  have  a  higher  likelihood  to  be  delayed  or  to 
drop  out  from  school  in  8  p.p.  and  2  p.p.,  respectively.  Moreover,  exposed  children  have  a  lower 
likelihood of being enrolled (3 p.p.), and less education measured by years of school exposure and 
completed years of schooling (difference is one entire school year). 
 
School enrollment is high in both children groups that was exposed to IPV and no-exposed 
to  IPV –  about  92% and 95% of children were engaged in  formal  education system, respectively. 
The percentage of dropout is low in both groups: 5% and 3% for children who were exposed to IPV 
and  not  exposed  to  IPV,  respectively.  For  these  cases,  the  difference  between  IPV  and  no  IPV 
groups are less than 3 percentage points. 

School delay, schooling exposure per year, and years of education  – the last two indicators 
used for children older than 9 – are used to assess school performance. About 56% of children who 
were exposed to  IPV and 47% of children who were not exposed to IPV experience school delay. 
That is, half of the analyzed children are in grades they should have concluded. 
 
Perhaps the most remarkable result: while 14% of children who were exposed to IPV have 
been  assaulted in  the last  year, less than 2% of  children who  were not  exposed to  IPV have been 
victimized by assault. This finding is in line with Tajima (2002) in that adolescents have a higher 
risk of physical assault in families which experienced an IPV. 
 
Finally, statistics from Table 2 show that IPV and no IPV groups are statistically different in 
their observable variables. Indeed, both groups are not comparable in the sense that covariates may 
affect  our  interest  variables  as  well  as  witnessing  domestic  violence.  Therefore,  the  proposed 
analytical method aims to create comparable treatment and control groups, with the same propensity 
to witness domestic violence, based on those covariates.  
 

 

 

 

                                                           
7 Data also show (statistics available upon request) that children who were exposed to mother's IPV are more engaged in 
the labor  market (21%) and are less  likely to live in a household  with  food security (23%) than  those not exposed to 
mother's IPV (17 and 57%, respectively).

The  first  step  to  perform  PSM  is  to  estimate  the  propensity  of  treatment,  based  on 
observable variables. We then regress the IPV indicator conditional on the covariates presented in 
Section 2B to obtain the estimated probability of IPV for all mothers in our sample. Based on the 
estimated propensity to suffer domestic violence, we are able to match observations from both IPV 
and  no  IPV  groups,  thus  creating  comparable  groups.  We  perform  the  matching  procedure  using 
Stata  14  “teffects”  code.  Using  covariate’s  balance  check,  we  are  able  to  verify  if  groups  are 
comparable after matching. Table 3 shows that the differences in covariates vanished after PSM. 
 
Table  4  shows  that  covariates  are  all  balanced  after  matching  procedure.  IPV  and  no  IPV 
groups  are  similar  regarding  observed  characteristics  after  matching.  Therefore,  both  are 
comparable groups and results from Table 3 are reliable. 
 
After  propensity  score  procedures,  we  can  compare  the  outcomes  of  children  exposed  to 
mothers'  IPV  to  those  of  not  exposed  children.  Table  4  shows  that  the  difference  in  school 

7 

 

 

enrollment between groups is not statistically significant; children that was exposed to IPV are more 
likely to have school delay and to drop out (8 p.p. and 2 p.p., respectively) than children unexposed 
to  IPV.  For  children  above  age  9,  those  exposed  to  IPV  have  0.5  and  0.3  lesser  year  of  school 
exposure  per  year  and  years  of  schooling,  respectively,  compared  to  no-exposed  IPV  children. 
These results are similar to those from Assaad et al. (2016). 

The proportion of IPV children that experienced any violence in the last year is 8 p.p. higher 
than that for no-exposed IPV children. We are aware of endogeneity problems with this outcome. 
While  Tajima  (2002)  establishes  a  link  between  wife  abuse  and  child  abuse,  Markowitz  (2001) 
argues  that  the  hypothesis  in  which  differences  in  demographic  groups  –  such  as  race,  age  and 
socioeconomic status – would yield different attitudes towards physical punishment against children 
does  not  hold.  Nevertheless,  here  we  are  not  considering  a  causal  relationship  between  that  result 
and mother's IPV.  
At this point, we should remember that our analysis is about a specific category of domestic 
 
violence victims: 6 to 17 years old sons and daughters living with their mothers, who experienced 
an  IPV.  Defining  IPV  witnessing  based  on  mother's  response  may  deepen  the  lack  of  children's 
voice  about  their  own  experiences  (Kimball,  2016).  Moreover,  the  definition  of  IPV  includes  the 
physical,  emotional/psychological,  financial  and  sexual  abuse,  which  may  occur  in  both 
heterosexual and same-sex couples (Daire et al., 2014; Tomsich et al., 2017; Ellsberg et al., 2001). 
However,  due  to  data  set  limitation,  we  restricted  our  analysis  to  physical  violence  that  women 
experienced  from  their  intimate  partners  (which  may  be  a  current  or  past  relationship)  in  the  last 
year.

4.  Concluding remarks 

 

In  this  paper,  using  Brazilian  data,  we  investigate  how  intimate  partner  violence  affects 

children school outcomes: school enrollment, school delay, and drop-out.  
            Our findings corroborated the previous studies: there is  no difference in  school  enrollment 
among witnesses and non-witnesses; but, children from violent households are more likely to drop-
out of school, to have fewer years of school exposure for their age and to attend classes from grades 
under  the  expected.  Witnesses  are  also  more  likely  to  be  assaulted  than  non-witnesses.  However, 
the relationship between violence towards mothers and sons/daughters is not straightforward. 
            The  findings  of  this  study  reflect  a  statistical  association  between intimate  partner 
violence and  education.  However,  any 
inferences  of  causality  are  only  suggestive  and 
tentative. Although we attempted to control for endogeneity by using a propensity matching score 
design,  we  were  not  able  to  establish  a  causal  relationship  between intimate  partner  violence 
witnessing and school outcomes for children. Data set limitations were crucial, and we should stress 
some of them.  
            First,  household  surveys  may  shed  light  on  this  research  field  but  are  not  screening 
substitutes.  Second,  the  lack  of  information  about  perpetrators  avoids  the  precise  estimation 
of intimate partner violence determinants. Third, underreporting may be worse in a general survey 
context  –  direct  questions  about  sensitive  topics,  poor  interviewer  training,  fear  of  perpetrator's 
retaliation,  shame  and  other  aspects  may  avoid  women  to  respond  honestly.  Last,  we  estimate 
effects of intimate partner violence on children without hearing children's voices – even though in a 
quantitative research context, the fact that someone else provides their information may be a way to 
hide unwelcome outcomes. Fourth, it is possible that a child we are assigning as an intimate partner 
violence witness did not actually witness his or her mother being assaulted. Furthermore, there is a 
wide  range  of  personal  involvement  with  the  aggression.  A  child  may  listen  to  his  or  her  parents 
discussing, or be present at the moment of the physical aggression – some of them would even try 
to help their mothers; fifth, we repeat parents' variables for children from the same family; sixth, we 
do not take into account more than one family cohabiting – although the family head can be more 
likely to make decisions about a family member than a household head, and; last but not least, we 
exclude from data set – and from all analysis – other relatives or employees and their children.  
            Despite these several limitations, our findings are unprecedented evidence about the damage 
that domestic violence has on human capital formation in Brazil.
