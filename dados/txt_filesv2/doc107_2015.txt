ABSTRACT 

 

One issue that affects the economic and social development of a country is the ability of the judiciary to present 
itself  as  a  legitimate  instance  in  resolving  conflicts  that  arise  in  the  social,  business  and  economic 
development. One way to measure this is through legitimacy of the motivations that lead citizens to trust or 
not in the Judiciary. We created the Brazilian Confidence in Justice Index (BCJI) as a validation argument 
for our confidence measure. The BCJI is a measure of perception, which shows the opinion of the population 
about Brazil’s judiciary. Our results indicate that race and gender are important predictors once controlled 
for other characteristics of respondents. Blacks have a slightly lower level of confidence in the judiciary than 
whites. Women also present less confidence than men. We also show that people with low income have lower 
levels of trust. Our findings also have other important implications for confidence in the judicial system. We 
show that there is a positive and strong relationship between confidence in the judicial system and propensity 
to seek the judiciary.  

 

RESUMO 

 

Uma questão que afeta o desenvolvimento econômico e social de um país é a capacidade do Judiciário de se 
apresentar como uma instância legítima na resolução de conflitos que surgem no desenvolvimento econômico 
e social. Uma forma de medir isso é através da legitimidade das motivações que levam os cidadãos a confiar 
ou não no Judiciário. Nós criamos um índice de confiança na Justiça no Brasil (BCJI) como argumento de 
validação para nossa medida de confiança. O BCJI é uma medida de percepção que mostra a opinião da 
população sobre o Judiciário. Nossos resultados indicam que raça e gênero são importantes preditores uma 
vez controlados por outras características dos respondentes. Os negros têm um nível ligeiramente inferior de 
confiança  no  Judiciário  do  que  os  brancos.  As  mulheres  também  apresentam  menos  confiança  do  que  os 
homens. Mostramos também que as pessoas com baixa renda têm níveis mais baixos de confiança.  Nossos 
resultados também têm outras implicações importantes para a confiança na justiça. Mostramos que existe 
uma relação positiva e forte entre a confiança na justiça e propensão a buscar o Judiciário.

1.  Introduction 

A crucial factor in the economic and social development of a country is the ability of the judiciary to 
present itself as a legitimate instance for the resolution of social and economic disputes. One way to 
measure  this  is  through  legitimacy  of  the  motivations  that  lead  citizens  to  trust  or  to  distrust  the 
judiciary.  

Institutions matter when transactions are costly (Coase, 1960); they provide structures through which 
individuals  can  make  transactions  despite  uncertainty  (North,  1990:  3).  For  North,  individuals  act 
with bounded rationality rather than the instrumental rationality. Economic agents make their choices 
based  on  incomplete  information  or  with  limited  computational  capacities  to  process  information. 
This  occurs  because  individuals  cannot  perfectly  predict  the  circumstances  under  which  the 
transactions  will  take  place.  That  is,  human  interaction  is  uncertain  and  costly,  which  hampers 
cooperation  and  economic  exchanges.  Thus,  institutions  exist  to  reduce  uncertainty  as  well  as 
transaction costs “by establishing a stable structure to human interactions” (North, 1990: 6). Some 
institutions, however, are more efficient than others in reducing transaction costs. Institutions are not 
necessarily or even usually created to be socially efficient; rather they, or at least the formal rules, are 
created to serve the interests of those with the bargaining power to devise new rules (North, 1990: 
16). Among what North calls “formal institutions”, the legal institutions provide a set of rules and 
procedures that protect property rights and ensure economic exchanges. 

The institutional infrastructure therefore fundamentally affects the political system of a country in 
which the rule of law exists. The judiciary is among the most important institutions in achieving and 
maintaining this condition (Buscaglia and Domingo, 1997). The judiciary has been a vital part of the 
emergence and consolidation of democracy in most Latin American countries as they moved from 
military and authoritarian regimes to democracy over the last two decades, mediating and resolving 
the  disputes  that  arise  in  society,  business,  economy,  and  politics.  Trust  in  the  judiciary  creates 
legitimacy and consolidates the rule of law (Levasseur, 2002). Measuring judicial performance is in 
this sense a way of measuring the effectiveness of the rule of law in a country. It is an indicator of 
the quality of a country’s democracy (O`Donnell, 1998). 

Notwithstanding an extensive literature examining trust in the judiciary in developed countries, scant 
attention has been devoted to emerging countries. The purpose of this study is to understand some of 
the determinants of public trust in the judicial system in Brazil, using a survey carried out in seven 
Brazilian  states.  It  explores  correlations  between  trust  in  the  judicial  system  and  a  pool  of 
demographic and economic variables such as race, income, age, gender, schooling years, previous 
experience with the judicial system, and knowledge about the judiciary.  

We developed a measure of judicial performance in Brazil based on the motivations that drive people 
to  trust  or to  distrust the country’s judicial system.  The result is  an index of trust in  the Brazilian 
justice,  presented  as  a  statistical  summary  carried  out  in  seven  Brazilian  states  and  based  on  a 
representative  sample  of  the  population  of  these  states.  We  used  eleven  waves  of  a  survey  via 
telephone interviews conducted by the São Paulo Law School of the Fundação Getulio Vargas. The 
sample consists of 4,685 respondents in 2010, 6,213 respondents in 2011, and 6,049 respondents in 
2012.  

One problem in describing public trust in the judiciary is that it is multifaceted. According to Staats, 
Hiskey and Bowler (2005), judicial performance is a multidimensional concept. The authors built a 
measure  based  on  five  dimensions:  the  extent  of  independence,  accountability,  efficiency, 
effectiveness,  and  accessibility.  They  surveyed  17  Latin  American  countries,  interviewed  legal 
experts, and developed a composite measure based on these five dimensions.  

We approach the same problem in a different way: we assess judicial performance via the factors that 
lead people to trust or to distrust the judicial system. We are interested in effectiveness in terms of 

 

 

expediency in deciding disputes; competence to resolve disputes (responsiveness); impartiality as a 
measure of accountability; independence from external political influence; and ease of use and costs 
as measures of access to justice. We created the Brazilian Confidence in Justice Index (BCJI) as our 
trust measure. The BCJI is a measure of perception; it reflects the opinion of the respondents about 
Brazil’s judiciary.  

In Brazil, the judiciary has a dual role. Sadek (2004) sees the Brazilian judiciary as both a state power 
and a public service provider. It acts as a state power when judging whether or not policies and actions 
of the executive and legislative branches of government comply with the Constitution, and it acts as 
a public service provider when adjudicating disputes and guaranteeing individual rights. We focus on 
the public service provider role of the judiciary: that is, on how effective it is in guaranteeing "justice" 
for individuals and business.   

The results indicate that people with greater knowledge of the judicial system present higher levels 
of trust in the Brazilian judicial system. This conclusion, however, may in some contexts be related 
with  the  knowledge  of  the  laws  themselves  rather  than  of  the  actual  procedures  of  the  judiciary. 
Another finding is that individuals with more schooling years (e.g., college-level education) also have 
a slightly higher level of trust in the judicial system. Compared to less-educated individuals, they tend 
to think that justice is cheaper, easier to access, more independent, honest, and competent. Our results 
also stress that race and gender are important predictors, once controlled for other characteristics of 
the respondents. Black persons have a slightly lower level of trust in the judicial system than do non-
black persons, which can be explained in part  by their perception that the judicial system  is  more 
expensive for and less fair to them. Compared to men, women think on one hand that the judiciary is 
faster, but on the other that it is less honest, accessible, inept at dispute resolution, and only somewhat 
independent. We find that people who have had previous experience with the judicial system report 
lower levels of trust. They believe that justice is more expensive and slower than do inexperienced 
individuals.  

Finally, we analyzed the relationship between trust in the judicial system and propensity to seek the 
judiciary in some hypothetical situations; this may be seen as a measure of realization of such trust 
in terms of actually demanding the services of the judiciary. We show that there is a positive and 
strong  relationship  between  trust  in  the  judicial  system  and  propensity  to  rely  on  the  courts.  This 
result indicates that  although the judiciary has lower levels  of trust  according depending on some 
demographic and economic characteristics, people nevertheless generally see it as a legitimate way 
to seek solution to their problems and do not hesitate to go to court in order to resolve the disputes 
which arise in their daily lives. 

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the empirical literature related to trust in the 
judicial system; Section 3 describes our methodology and our sample; Section 4 presents the results; 
and finally Section 5 presents the conclusions. 

2.  Literature Review 

The literature indicates that a variety of factors  -- including  gender, race, income,  years of formal 
schooling, and previous experience with the judiciary -- influence public trust in the courts. Lawrence 
(2002) presents evidence that in the United States women rely less on justice compared to men. In 
general, these results seem to be related with perceived violence and discrimination against women. 
Nomura  (2010)  and  Brown,  Moon  and  Zoloth  (1980),  for  instance,  show  that  gender-based  wage 
discrimination is very significant in the United States labor market.  

Lovell  (2000)  argues  that  women  and  black  persons  who  work  in  São  Paulo  experience  greater 
discrimination when compared to their counterparts in Bahia. In addition, Waiselfisz (2012) shows 
that among 84 countries Brazil has the seventh highest female murder rate. Given all this, we expect 

 

 

that there are significant differences in terms of trust in the judicial system between men and women 
in Brazil.  

Another question that emerges is whether skin color matters in terms of trust in the judical system. 
Sherman (2002) presents evidence that in the United States there are clear racial divisions of opinion 
about the criminal justice system’s component institutions, though not about the system as a whole. 
He shows that non-black persons have twice as much trust in their local court systems than do black 
persons.  DeLisi  and  Regoli  (1999)  show  that  black  persons  in  the  United  States  are  arrested, 
prosecuted,  convicted,  and  incarcerated  in  numbers  disproportionate  to  their  percentage  of  the 
population.  For  them,  one  explanation  of  this  is  that  racial  discrimination  against  black  persons 
pervades the American of criminal justice system. In Brazil, black persons are more severely punished 
than non-black persons counterparts for committing crimes of equal or comparable severity (Adorno, 
1995).  Bailey, Loveman and Muniz (2013) find that racial disparities in Brazil are most severe at the 
upper end of the income distribution and that racial disparities in earnings are larger when race is 
determined by interviewers rather than self-identified.  

Bennack (1999) shows that in the United States people with higher incomes and more years of formal 
schooling report greater trust in most of the institutions examined. Trust in the criminal justice system 
is generally more prevalent  among  younger people, those who are better educated, and those with 
higher incomes (Jones, Weatherburn, and McFarlane, 2008). Furthermore, people who know more 
about the courts are more likely to feel confident in them, as are people who have higher education 
levels (Benesh, 2006). In the Brazilian context, we also expect that people with higher incomes and 
more years of formal schooling will exhibit higher levels of trust in the Brazilian judicial system.  

Salzman and Ramsey (2013) find that in Latin America previous experience with the judicial system 
is likely to cause more awareness of the court’s deficiencies and hence probably leads to lower levels 
of trust in the judicial system. They also show that even in situations where a litigant achieves success 
in the courts, the experience with the imperfect process in a Latin American judicial system may still 
result in lower levels of trust relative to the inexperienced position from  which the litigant began. 
Thus, people who have had previous experience with the judiciary may present lower levels of the 
trust in the judicial system when compared to people who have had no previous experience with the 
Brazilian judiciary. 

Knowledge about the judicial system has a significant relationship with trust in the courts (Gibson et 
al.,1998;  Benesh,  2006).  In  emerging  economies,  individuals  who  are  better  informed  about  the 
judicial system will recognize its inadequacies,  which leads to  lower levels  of trust  (Salzman and 
Ramsey, 2013). In this context, we expect that there is a difference between people with and people 
without knowledge of judiciary procedures in terms of trust in the Brazilian judicial system.  

3.  Methodology and Sample 

 
Our results are based on eleven waves of a survey conducted in 2010, 2011 and 2012. This survey 
was performed via telephone interviews over a period of thirty-three months. The population of the 
survey is comprised of people distributed across the following states: Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, Rio 
Grande do Sul, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and the Distrito Federal, which combined represent 
approximately  60%  of  the  population,  according  to  the  2010  census  conducted  by  the  Instituto 
Brasileiro  de  Geografia  e  Estatística  (IBGE).  The  respondent  is  an  individual  who  represents  the 
selected household, of any gender (male or female) and aged 18 or higher.  

We  use  a  method  of  proportional  quota  sampling,  using  the  following  quotas:  gender,  household 
income, education, age, and economic status (i.e., economically active or not). The groups (strata) 
were  proportionally  distributed  according  to  the  2010  Census  and  the  2009  National  Household 

 

 

Sample Survey4. Our sample consists of 4,685 respondents in 2010, 6,213 respondents in 2011, and 
6,049 respondents in 2012. Table.1 provides an overview of the sample. 

The sample is distributed through 7 states, which according to 2010 census data together correspond to approximately 
60%  of  the  country’s  population.  The  sample  size  was  determined  by  the  number  of  inhabitants  in  each  state.  The 
sampling frame was constructed so as to have a range of 95% and an absolute sampling error of 2.5%.

Table.3 displays descriptive statistics for covariates. We have that 38% of respondents claim to trust 
the Federal Government and 39% of respondents have had previous experience with the judiciary. 
Our sample is similar to Brazilian demographic data in terms of gender and race. In our sample, 52% 
of respondents are female and 10% are black. The overall Brazilian population is 8% black and 51% 
female according to the 2010 Census. Our sample diverges somewhat from the 2010 Census in terms 

                                                           
4 Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios (PNAD), is a national household sample survey that investigates every year -- and on 
a continuous basis -- overall population characteristics, education, labor, income and housing, among others, for different periods of 
time and according to the need of information about the country. Other topics such as migration, fertility are also covered.  

 

 

of income. The number of households with monthly per capita income between 0 and 1 minimum 
wages represents 46% of our sample. For the Brazilian population as a whole the corresponding share 
is 54%. In our sample households with monthly per capita income between 1 and 4 minimum wages 
represent  37%  of  population.  In  Brazil  the  corresponding  share  is  31%.  These  differences  can  be 
partly explained by the fact that our sample includes some of the richest Brazilian states: São Paulo, 
Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul.  Appendix A.2.4 displays these statistics by 
state.   

Our sample is representative, however, for the following seven states: Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, 
Rio Grande do Sul, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and the Distrito Federal. Our sample data is 
generally similar to demographic data for these states in terms of gender and race. In terms of income, 
the starkest divergences occur in the cases of Bahia and Pernambuco. Households with monthly per 
capita income between 0 and 1 minimum wages represent 74% and 73% of the population in Bahia 
and Pernambuco, respectively. In our sample, these numbers are 53% and 52%, respectively.

The BCJI is calculated as the average from a set of nine questions covering the main aspects of 
confidence in the judicial system. The respondent must issue his opinion on the judicial system 
regarding:  confidence;  speed  in  solving  conflict;  cost  access;  ease  of  access;  political 
independence; honesty; ability to solve conflicts; panorama of the last 5 years and expectation for 
the next 5 years. Appendix A.2.1 presents details regarding questionnaire used by the FGV Survey.  

For each question, we use the weighted average of responses. For example, in order to compute 

 

 

the weighted average of the first question about trust in the judicial system, we use four response 
categories that include: 1 = not at all confident, 2 = not very confident, 3 = fairly confident, and 4 
= very confident. In order for each question to have the same weight in the index, we normalize 
each  question  so  that’s  its  value  ranges  from  0  to  10.  The  normalization  is  given  by  the  ratio 
between the value of the response to each question and its maximum possible value. This ratio is 
then multiplied by 10. Thus, to compute the BCJI, we first sum the responses to all 9 questions, 
and then divide by 9. As each question ranges from 0 to 10, it follows that the BCJI will also range 
between 0 and 10. Appendix A.2.2 presents details regarding index construction. Table.4 describes 
the BCJI and its components.  

Table.4 Description of the BCJI and its Components. 

The questions that constitute the questionnaire admit either four or five responses. Each question is identified by assigning 
an index n to its response, which also corresponds to a value assigned to that response. Thus, the first response, i.e., the 
answer  0,  is  assigned  the  value  0.  To  the  last  response  is  assigned  the  maximum  value,  which  can  be  either  3  or  4 
depending on whether the question has four or five possible responses. The values are first normalized so as to range 
between 0 and 10, and then weighted according to the proportion of each question. To compute the BCJI, we first sum 
the weighted responses for all 9 questions, and then divide by 9.

Table.5 displays the basic statistics of the BCJI for each year. Overall, the BCJI has been fairly 
stable  between  2010  and  2012.  This  is  natural  insofar  as  institutional  change  is  generally 
incremental  rather  than  sudden,  an  accumulation  of  many  small  changes  rather  than  occasional 
large  changes.  Institutional  change  over  time  is  path-dependent  because  individuals  learn, 
organizations develop, and ideologies form in the context of a particular set of formal and informal 
rules (North, 1990).  

Although the BCJI has not dramatically changed over time, there are have occured some significant 
fluctuations  in  some  demographic  and  economic  characteristics  of  respondents  such  as  race, 
income, age, gender, schooling years, previous experience with the justice, and knowledge about 
the judiciary.

Figure.1 is a histogram showing the overall variation in trust in the judicial system for the 16,867 
respondents in our sample. As can be seen, the distribution of BCJI scores is reasonably symmetric 
and close to normal. 

This histogram shows the fraction of respondents with Brazilian Confidence in Justice Index (BCJI) scores in the shown 
ranges. Sample = 16,867 respondents.  Mean = 4.27, standard deviation =1.29, and median = 4.25.

Table.6 provides Pearson correlation coefficients between the BCJI and its component questions. 
In all sample years, the BCJI correlates positively with each question, with coefficients ranging 
from 0.41 to 0.64. Part of this correlation is by construction, because each question is a part of the 
BCJI.  The  correlations  between  questions  are  generally  positive  and  statistically  significant  but 
moderate. The correlation is high for some questions like trust, access cost, and honesty, but only 
moderate -- between -0.02 and 0.35 -- for the other questions. This suggests that, except for trust, 
access  cost,  and  honesty,  colinearity  between  the  questions  and  the  BCJI  should  not  be  a  big 
problem.

To  shed  some  light  on  the  drivers  for  individual  trust  in  the  judicial  system  we  adjusted  a  model 
including demographic and economic variables by running Pooled Ordinary Least Squares (Pooled 
OLS) regressions. The BCJI for respondent 𝑖 in period 𝑡 (𝐵𝐶𝐽𝐼𝑖,𝑡) is modeled as: 

𝐵𝐶𝐽𝐼𝑖,𝑡 =   𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖 + 𝛽3𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑖 + 𝛽4𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖,𝑡

𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽6𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽7𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽8𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑖,𝑡

Many  personal  characteristics  are  potentially  associated  with  trust  in  the  judiciary.  We  therefore 
included also an additional set of control variables, such as state, quarter, employment, and marital 
status dummies (included in 𝑥𝑖,𝑡

′ , which is a column vector of control variables).  

In order to examine the relationship between these features and the questions of BCJI, we ran Pooled 
OLS for each question. 

 𝑃1𝑖,𝑡 =   𝛾0 + 𝛾1𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛾2𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖 + 𝛾3 ∗ 𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑖 + 𝛾4𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖,𝑡

4.  Empirical Results  

 

4.1.Trust in the Judicial System 

Regression  analysis  was  used  to  examine  the  influence  of  gender,  race,  income,  schooling  years, 
previous  experience  with  the  judiciary,  and  knowledge  about  the  judiciary  on  public  trust  in  the 
judicial system.  

Table.7 shows that trust in the judicial system varies widely among these groups. Women trust the 
judiciary less than men do. The results obtained via Pooled OLS indicate that the levels of trust in the 
judiciary of women are 12 basis points lower (with significance at the 1% level) than those of men. 
Compared to  men, they  see the judiciary as less  honest,  faster, only somewhat  independent,  more 
difficult to access, and less effective little in resolving disputes.  

These  results  are  similar  to  Lawrence  (2002)  and  may  be  explained  in  part  by  two  aspects: 
discrimination and violence against women. Brazil has the seventh highest female murder rate among 
the 84 countries examined by Waiselfisz (2012). He shows that the murder rate in Brazil was roughly 
4.4 victims for every 100,000 women. Physical  violence is  prevalent, comprising 44.2% of cases. 
The share of psychological or moral harassment is higher than 20%, and 12.2% of victims are sexually 
assaulted.  Some  studies also  show  that  significant  discrimination  exists  within  the  Brazilian  labor 
market.  Lovell  (2000)  argues  that  women  and  black  persons  who  work  in  São  Paulo  experience 
greater discrimination than their counterparts in Bahia.  

Race is also an important predictor of citizens’ trust in the judicial system. We find that black persons 
have lower levels of trust in the judicial system than do non-black persons. The results indicate that 
the levels of trust of black persons in the judiciary are 4.8 basis points lower than those of non-black 
persons (with significance at the 10% level). Compared to non-black persons, black persons see the 
judiciary as more expensive and less honest.  

The regression outputs also are consistent with the literature that documents these racial disparities. 
Some studies show that minority group members are more distrustful and less confident in the police 
and the courts (Huang and Vaughn, 1996; Lasley, 1994; Schumann, Steeh, Bobo, and Krysan, 1997). 
These minority concerns are largely fueled by issues of racial profiling (Cole, 1999; Kennedy, 1997).  

One way to interpret these results is that they reflect black persons’ perception of the legitimacy of 
the laws. That is, they tend to have seen the rules themselves as biased. Additionally, some studies 
show  that  black  Brazilians  suffer  significant  discrimination.  Twine  (1998),  Reichmann  (1999), 
Burdick  (1998),  Sheriff  (2000),  and  Bailey,  Loveman  and  Muniz  (2013)  have  provided  some 
evidence  of  racism  experienced  by  black  Brazilians.  Furthermore,  according  to  the  MNDH 
(Movimento  Nacional  de  Direitos  Humanos)  the  federal  police  apparatus  killed  three  times  more 
black persons than non-black persons in 1997. 

The BCJI results regarding the question of trust in the judiciary show that people with high incomes 
have higher levels of trust in the judicial system. They regard Brazilian justice as more politically 
independent, less expensive, and easier to access than do lower-income Brazilians. These results are 
consistent  with  the  literature  that  suggests  that  richer  or  more  powerful  individuals  are  treated 
differently than those without such resources (Bennack, 1999).  

 

 

We also obtained evidence that people with more years of formal schooling exhibit higher levels of 
trust  in  the judicial system.  The coefficient  implies that a one  year of additional formal schooling 
predicts a 0.71 basis point increase (statistically significant at the 1% level) in the BCJI. Our results 
suggest that as schooling increases, then so do the perceptions of legal costs, political independence, 
and honesty of the judiciary, although the perception of its ability to resolve disputes decreases. Jones, 
Weatherburn,  and  McFarlane  (2008)  present  evidence  that  trust  in  the  criminal  justice  system  is 
generally more prevalent among younger people, among those who are better educated, and among 
those with higher incomes. They also found that respondents who earned higher annual incomes were 
more confident that the judicial system is effective in bringing people to the courts, meeting the needs 
of victims, respecting the rights of the accused, and treating the accused fairly. Benesh (2006) also 
shows that people who reported that they knew more about the courts were more likely to trust them, 
as were people who had higher levels of schooling.    

In  terms  of  experience  with  the  judiciary,  our  results  indicate  that  people  who  have  had  previous 
experience present  levels of trust  11.07 basis points lower than people who have had no previous 
experience with the judiciary (with significance at the 1% level). For these respondents, although the 
judiciary is more politically independent and easily accessible, it is also slower and more expensive 
when compared to people who have had no previous experience with the judiciary. These results are 
similar to those of Salzman and Ramsey (2013).  

Finally,  we  found  that  people  with  greater  knowledge  of  the  judiciary  trust  it  more.  These  results 
indicate that people with knowledge about the judiciary present 17.36 basis points higher levels of 
trust (with significance at the 10% level). Nonetheless, these findings may relate to knowledge of the 
law  itself,  as  opposed  to  of  the  procedures  of  the  judicial  system.  Furthermore,  these  results  are 
consistent with Gibson et al. (1998) and Benesh (2006), who present evidence that knowledge about 
the judicial system has a significant relationship with trust in the courts.  

 

 

In column (1) the dependent variable is the BCJI, which has a range between 0 and 10. It is the average of a set of nine questions covering the main aspects of trust in the judicial 
system. In columns (2), (3), …, (10), we set out the questions used in the BCJI, where the respondent is required to issue his or her opinion on the judicial system regarding: trust 
(2) ; speed in resolving disputes (3); access cost (4); ease of access (5); political independence (6); honesty (7); ability to resolve disputes (8); panorama of the last 5 years (5); and 
expectation for the next 5 years (10).

4.2.Confidence in the Judicial System and Propensity to seek the Judiciary 

We also assessed the relationship between trust in the judicial system and propensity to resort to 
the  judiciary  in  six  hypothetical  situations.  The  ensuing  behavior  index  was  based  on  a  set  of 
questions whereby respondents stated how likely it is that they would resort to the judiciary to 
resolve  a  hyphotetical  dispute  or  problem.  The  possible  answers  to  those  questions  being:  (i) 
definitely not, (ii) probably not, (iii) probably yes, and (iv) definitely yes. The behavior index is 
thus  a measure of the population’s perception of their own propensity to  use the court system. 
Appendix A.2.3 presents details regarding index construction. 

The  index  is  built  on  cases  concerning  family  issues  (C1),  provision  of  service  issues  (C2), 
consumer issues (C3), neighborhood issues (C4), labor disputes (C5), and a case involving the 
government (C6). We also took into account situations in which people from very different income 
levels and social groups share the same experience, as well as hypothetical scenarios in which the 
respondents were asked to imagine themselves on different sides in the dispute. At one juncture, 
for instance, the respondent plays the role of the consumer, with a weaker position, whereas in 
another scenario the interviewee is the service provider, having thus a stronger position. 

Analogously to equation (1), we adjusted a model including demographic and economic variables 
to  shed  some  light  on  drivers  for  the  Behavior  Index.  We  ran  Pooled  Ordinary  Least  Squares 
(Pooled OLS) regressions. The Behavior Index for the respondent 𝑖 that was surveyed in the period 
𝑡 (𝐵𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑟 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑖,𝑡) is modeled as: 

 
𝐵𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑟 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑖,𝑡 =   𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝐵𝐶𝐽𝐼𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖,𝑡 +
𝛽3𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖 + 𝛽4𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑖 + 𝛽5𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽6𝑎𝑔𝑒2
𝛽9𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽10𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑙𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛿′ 𝑥𝑖,𝑡

𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽7𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽8𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑖,𝑡 +
′ + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡  (5)  

We included also an additional set of control variables, such as state, quarter, employment, and 
marital status dummies (included in 𝑥𝑖,𝑡

′ , which is a column vector of control variables).  

Table.8 shows a positive relationship between trust in the judicial system and the behavior index, 
in  clear support of our hypothesis  that people with  higher levels  of trust  in  the judicial system 
have a higher propensity to resort to the judiciary. Hence, our behavior index is more adequately 
termed the “trust realization index”. The Pooled OLS coefficient implies that a one unit increase 
in the BCJI predicts a 7.8 basis point increase in the behavior index (with significance at the 1% 
level). In general, people have a higher propensity to seek the judiciary in cases concerning family 
issues, neighborhood issues, labor disputes, and cases involving the government. Underlying this 
result is the fact that the respondents see the justice system as a legitimate stage for the resolution 
of their disputes. 

 

Our  results  also  show  that  there  is  a  positive  and  statically  significant  correlation  between  the 
behavior index and some demographic and economic variables such as being female, being black, 
age,  schooling  years,  previous  experience  with  the  judiciary,  and  knowledge  about  the  justice 
court system. Our estimations indicate that although the judiciary has lower levels of the trust for 
some demographic and economic variables, most Brazilians perceive it as a legitimate way to seek 
solutions  to  their  problems  and  would  not  hesitate  to  go  to  court  to  solve  them.  For  example, 

 

 

although women generally have lowers levels of trust in the judicial system than men, they are 
more likely to seek the judiciary for family, labor, and service issues, but less likely to seek it for 
consumer issues. We find similar results regarding age and previous experience with the judiciary. 
These results are statistically significant at the 1% level. 

Lambsdorff (1999) argues that the keys to less corruption and greater trust are an effective system 
of property rights and the rule of law. If the law is enforced on fair grounds, then people will be 
more likely to obey the law and to trust the judicial system. In contrast, if people feel that they are 
treated unfairly, then they will rely less the courts and will be less likely to obey the laws. Higher-
trusting societies have better governance and faster economic growth. They also spend more on 
redistribution and have greater respect for the law (Uslaner, 2002). 

 

 

Table.8 Determinants of the Behavior Index – Pooled OLS Regression 

In column (1) the dependent variable is the Behavior Index, which ranges between 0 and 10. It is based on a set of 
six questions whereby respondents stated how likely they would be to resort to the judiciary to resolve a dispute or 
problem, the possible answers to those questions being: (i) definitely not, (ii) probably not, (iii) probably yes, and (iv) 
definitely yes. The behavior index is thus a measure of the population’s perception of its own propensity to go to 
court to resolve disputes. In columns (2), (3), …, (7),  we set out the  hypothetical questions used in the Behavior 
Index, such as cases concerning family issues (2), provision of service (3), consumer issues (4), neighborhood issues 
(5), labor disputes (6) and a case involving the government (7).

Finally, we also studied the connection between trust in the judicial system and willingness to 
go  to  court  by  applying  pseudo-panel  techniques  to  available  cross-sectional  data.  Recently 
pseudo-panel  methods  have  been  used  to  overcome  some  of  the  known  limitations  of  cross 
sectional  data;  they  allow  for  example  to  control  for  unobservable  characteristics  of  survey 

 

 

respondents.  

Our pseudo-panel builds on the same waves of the survey conducted in 2010, 2011 and 2012. 
We draw largely on the methodology set forth by Verbeek and Vella (2005) and Verbeek (2007) 
to determine the sizes of the cohorts as well as the variables chosen to construct the cohorts. 
Our cohorts are based on the ages and the years of education of the respondents. Verbeek (2007) 
argues  that  suitably  choosing  these  variables  is  essential  for  maintaining  the  asymptotic 
properties of the pseudo-panel. Our cohorts partition the ages of the respondents into five-year 
intervals, including only individuals aged between 18 and 72. We select the following 7 groups 
according to schooling years: 0-3 years, 4 years, 5-7 years, 8 years, 9-10 years, 11 years, and 
12 years or more. After defining the cohorts, a set of other variables is combined into the dataset, 
including a pool  of demographic and economic  variables such as  race, income, age,  gender, 
schooling  years, and all questions related to  the main aspects  of trust  in  the judicial system. 
Based on this data structure we  generate the pseudo-panels  by averaging all variables at  the 
cohort level.  

Our  pseudo-panel  is  formed  creating  synthetic  observations  obtained  from  averaging  real 
observations with similar characteristics in a sequence of repeated cross sectional data sets. In 
this way, the synthetic units of observations can be thought as being “followed” over time. The 
model then requires an appropriate modification: 

̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
𝐵𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑟 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥

𝑐,𝑡 =   𝛼̅𝑐  + 𝛽1 ∗ 𝐵𝐶𝐽𝐼

̅̅̅̅̅̅𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿′ ∗ 𝑥̅𝑐,𝑡

′ + 𝑢̅𝑐,𝑡,   c=1,…,C,   t=1,…,T.             (6)  

where  the  individual  index,  i,  has  been  replaced  by  a  cohort  index,  c  and  𝛼̅𝑐   is  the  fixed  effect 
′
parameter. Analogously to equation (5), the slope 𝛽1 is the parameter of interest and  𝑥̅𝑐,𝑡
 is a vector 
of control variables.  
 
                                                 Figure.2  shows  the  cohort  sizes.  We  have  77  cohorts  with  an 
average  of  219  and  a  median  of  189  observations  per  cohort.  The  minimum  and  maximum 
cohort values are 21 and 921, respectively.

Table.9  lays  out  the  basic  descriptive  statistics  of  the  pseudo-panel  for  all  questions  and 
demographic and economic variables of the constructed cohorts. The average BCJI in 2010 was 
4.17. It jumped to 4.28 in 2011 and then slightly increased to 4.31 in 2012. So overall the BCJI 
has not changed much over time. This result is due to the low variation among the answers to the 
questions  that  constitute  the  index.  Something  similar  happened  with  the  behavior  index:  its 
average in 2010 was 6.95, then increased to 7.08 in 2011, and then decreased to 7.00 in 2012.

Table.10 reinforces our previous findings as to a positive connection between trust and its practical 
realization.  The  coefficient  of  the  BCJI  is  positive  and  statistically  strong.  The  RE  coefficient 
implies that a one unit increase in the BCJI predicts a 30 basis point increase in the behavior index 
(with significance at the 1% level). When controlled for unobserved effects of each cohort (FE) 
this coefficient is lower, but still statistically significant at the 5% level.

5.  Conclusion  

This  paper  relies  on  a  series  of  waves  of  the  FGV  survey  to  provide  further  insight  into  the 
determinants of the various degrees of trust in the judicial system in Brazil over 2010-2012, as 
well  as  into  their  implications  in  terms  of  actual  resort  to  the  judicial  system.  We  develop  a 
measure of judicial performance in Brazil that is based on the motivations behind people’s trust 
or distrust on the country’s judicial system. The resulting index performs well as a measure of the 
population´s views on the reliability of the Brazilian justice system. 

Our findings support the view that race and gender are important predictors once controlled for 
other characteristics of respondents. Black persons and women have a slightly lower level of trust 
in the judicial system. People who have had previous experience with the judiciary also tend to 
trust the judicial system less. On the other hand, better-educated individuals and individuals better 
acquainted  with  the  judicial  system  trust  it  more.  In  particular,  our  results  show  that  a  highly 
educated  individual  with  some  understanding  of  the  judicial  system  –  and  consequently 
heightened deference towards governmental institutions – will have the highest levels of trust in 
the judicial system. On the other extreme, the lowest levels of trust are exhibited by persons who 
have been less exposed to formal education, who are female, who are black, and who are skeptical 
about  government  institutions.  These  results  are  quite  intuitive  and  confirm  some  interesting 
notions about what drives trust in the judicial system. In present days it is essential that the judicial 
system consider carefully what drives support for its institutions.   

In addition to the abovementioned conclusions, we also found evidence of a positive relationship 
between trust in the judicial system and the behavior index (the “trust realization index”), the latter 
being a measure of people’s perception about their propensity to actually go to court to resolve 
their disputes. That is, people who have higher levels of trust in the judicial system are more likely 
to use its services. We determined furthermore that being female, being black, being older, being 
better educated, having previous experience with the judiciary, and being knowledgeable about 
the  court  system  are  all  positively  correlated  with  the  trust  realization  index.  Somewhat 
surprisingly, although these people have lower levels of trust in the judiciary, they are more likely 
to  seek  the  judiciary  in  some  hypothetical  situations  such  as  cases  concerning  family  issues, 

 

 

provision  of  service  issues,  consumer  issues,  neighborhood  issues,  labor  disputes,  and  cases 
involving  the  government.  Despite  their  misgivings  about  the  judicial  system  these  people  do 
perceive it as a legitimate venue for seeking solutions to their problems and do not hesitate to go 
to court in order to solve disputes. 

Finally, our findings point to other important implications of trust in the judicial system. Given 
that black persons and women exhibit lower levels of the trust, efforts should be made to reduce 
costs of judicial services, thus entailing greater access to the judicial system as well as a greater 
sense of fairness. Our findings also show that people with low income have lower levels of the 
trust in the judicial system. Nonetheless, our results should be viewed as provisory conclusions of 
an empirical analysis on some of the determinants of trust in the Brazilian judicial system. Further 
and  more  accurate  estimates  and  measures  of  trust  institutional  are  needed  if  we  truly  want  to 
better tackle the influence of other aspects on trust in the judicial system.
