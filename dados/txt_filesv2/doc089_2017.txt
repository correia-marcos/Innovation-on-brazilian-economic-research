Abstract: This paper assesses the consequences of domestic outsourcing on different groups of workers, 
stemming  from  a  theoretical  model  with  heterogeneous  individuals  and  firms.  We  find  the  wage  gap 
between outsourced workers and non-outsourced ones to be larger for more productive workers, as well 
as for those who work at sectors where observation of their effort is harder. Furthermore, using Brazilian 
micro-data and quantile regressions, we demonstrate that the effect of outsourcing on wages grows with 
income, as suggested by the theoretical model.

Resumo:  Este  artigo  avalia  as  consequências  da  terceirização  doméstica  sobre  diferentes  grupos  de 
trabalhadores a partir de um modelo teórico com indivíduos e firmas heterogêneos. Nossa análise teórica 
indica  que  o  gap  salarial  para  trabalhadores  terceirizados  deve  ser  maior  para  os  trabalhadores  mais 
produtivos, assim como para aqueles indivíduos que trabalham em setores em que é mais difícil observar 
o seu esforço. Além disso, usando microdados brasileiros, nós evidenciamos por meio de um arcabouço 
de regressão quantílica que os efeitos da terceirização sobre os salários tornam-se mais relevantes para os 
indivíduos com maior salário, o que corrobora as conclusões do nosso modelo teórico.

1. Introduction 
Over  the  last  two  decades,  the  economic  impacts  of  service  outsourcing  have  generated  ever-
 
increasing academic interest (MANKIW and SWAGEL, 2006). Amid these studies (carefully reviewed in 
the  next  section),  some  seek  to  estimate  outsourcing’s  effects  on  wages,  and  overall  conclude  that 
outsourced workers earn less than their non-outsourced counterparts. 
 
Williamson  (2008)  suggests  the  outsourcing  processes  can  be  adopted  under  very  distinct 
circumstances and with equally distinguished objectives. Thus, workers from different sectors and levels 
of human capital could be outsourced. 
this  paper,  we  focus  on  domestic  outsourcing  –  witch  contrasts  with  offshoring 
 
(GOLDSHIMIDT and SCHMIEDER, 2017). We evaluate whether the effects of outsourcing on workers’ 
wages are homogeneous or not. We therefore intend to build a highly stylized model that underlines how 
disparities in the labor outsourcing sector and in  the outsourced workers’ productivity can influence the 
observed wage gap.  
 
Moreover, an empirical analysis will be carried in order to test the conclusions of this theoretical 
model.  Data  from  the  Annual  Social  Information  Report  (RAIS)  for  2014  will  be  used,  and  so  will  a 
methodology of quantile regression, to explore heterogeneous effects of outsourcing on wages.  
 
This article consists of five sections, in addition to this introduction. Section 2 reviews literature 
concerning outsourcing in relation to wages. Section 3 develops the theoretical model. Section 4 discusses 
the  database  employed,  as  well  as  presents  the  empirical  model  and  its  results.  Section  5  tests  the 
adjustment of the model when we control for selection of outsourced workers. 
 
 
2. The impact of outsourcing on wages 
 
 
 
As pointed out in the introduction, this paper focuses on domestic outsourcing processes and their 
implications on the wages of the workers who have been outsourced. Berlinski (2008) is  the first paper 
with  similar  purpose.  He  assess  the  consequences  of  outsourcing  for  low  human  capital  workers  in  the 
United Kingdom. 
 
The  author  builds  a  database  for  workers  from  1995  to  2001  and  conducts  estimates  of  a 
Mincerian equation, which includes a dummy variable for outsourced workers, through Generalized Least 
Squares (GLS) and propensity score matching, and concludes that the evaluated workers are paid 17% to 
19% less than non-outsourced similar employees. His outsourcing definition is  somewhat  limited, since 
his database has fewer than sixty outsourced workers.  
 
Dube and Kaplan (2010) also perform an empirical work to analyze the effect of outsourcing on 
low-human capital workers, more specifically guards and janitors, in the U.S. An outsourcing indicating 
variable,  similar  to  the  one  used  in  this  study,  is  created  by  the  combination  of  information  on  the  job 
performed  by  each  worker  and  the  sector  in  which  they  work,  using  micro-data  from  the  Current 
Population Survey (CPS), between 1983 and 2000. 
 
The  authors  construct  a  Mincerian  equation  and  estimate  it  via  the  Generalized  Least  Squares 
(GLS)  method.  In  this  first  estimation,  it  is  shown  that  outsourced  janitors  make  about  5%  less,  while 
guards earn about 20% less, when compared to non-outsourced workers in the same occupation. 
Dube and Kaplan (2010) then examine if unobservable differences in productivity may explain the 
 
wage gap. They build a two-period panel and individuals with the same occupation are observed on each 
of the periods. Subsequently, a new wage equation is estimated through the first difference method. The 
outsourcing  wage  penalties  still  remain  though,  around  7%  for  janitors  and  12%  for  guards.  This 
methodology was, then, used in all subsequent papers on the topic.  
 
Thereby,  the  authors  find  outsourced  workers  are  paid  less  due  to  their  contract  type.  They  also 
conclude  that  the  penalty  suffered  by  the  workers  is  not  explained  by  low  rent  pass-through  or 
compensating  differentials,  so  it  must  be  associated  with  some  non-taken  rent,  like  the  one  obtained 
through  unionization,  for  instance;  since  the  persistent  estimated  difference  is  not  compatible  with  the 
hypothesis  of  a  competitive  market.  Despite  these  considerations,  Dube  and  Kaplan  (2010)  do  not  go 
further in the outsourcing wage penalty theory.  

Stein,  Zylberstajn  e  Zylberstajn  (2016)  apply  the  previous  methodology  to  Brazilian  data.  The 
authors  consider  outsourced  workers  in  the  cleaning,  security,  technology  of  information  (TI), 
maintenance and research and development (R&D). The author show that almost all the raw outsourced 
wage gap in their sample can be explained by different individual characteristics. Once they control for 
variant  observable  and  fixed  unobservable  characteristics  through  the  first-difference  method,  they 
conclude that the average wage gap is about only 3%. 

They do not systematically analyze how the wage gap varies with different characteristics of the 
workers,  but,  by  estimating  separate  regressions  for  each  sector,  they  point  out  that  the  gap  tends  to  be 
higher for low-skilled workers.         
 
 Belchior  and  Bertussi  (2016)  also  utilize  a  Brazilian  data,  similar  to  the  one  in  this  paper,  and 
used  the  detailed  available  classifications  on  occupations  and  sectors  in  order  to  create  broad 
classification  for  outsourced  workers1.  A  Mincerian  equation  is  estimated,  in  order  to  conclude  that 
outsourced workers earn 7.2% to 10.5% less than non-outsourced ones. Furthermore, the authors examine 
if  unobservable  fixed  effects  bias  the  estimate,  in  a  similar  manner  as  Dube  and  Kaplan  (2010);  then, 
through  a  first  difference  model  in  panel  data,  come  to  the  conclusion  that  a  fixed  bias  does  not 
significantly  alter  the  previous  estimation.  An  extensive  analysis  is  carried,  looking  to  identify  average 
effects of outsourcing.  
  
The  authors  argue  that  these  wage  disparities  are  motivated  by  differences  in  efficiency  wage 
payments  for  outsourced  and  non-outsourced  workers.  This  suggestion  provides  an  explanation  for  the 
difference in rents uncovered by Dube and Kaplan (2010). 
 
Goldshimidt e Schmieder (2017) also employed the previous methodology and estimated average 
impacts of outsourcing on German workers of logistics, food, security and cleaning (LFSC) sectors. They 
found that analyzed outsourced workers suffered a 9% wage penalty. These results are broadly consistent 
with previous estimates.  

Despite that, they argue that it is difficult to account for different job characteristics of outsourced 
workers. The authors suggest using on-site outsourcing events as an identification strategy. They identify 
several  aggregate  flows  of  workers  from  final  to  intermediate  firms  in  the  LFSC’s  sectors.  It  is  argued 
that these outsourced workers were likely to perform the same activities as they were previously doing.  

Their estimates show that the workers who passed through such an event  received between 10% 
and  15%  less  than  similar  workers  who  were  not  outsourced,  ten  years  of  the  outsourcing  event. 
Goldshimidt  e  Schmieder  (2017)  also  employ  the  decomposition  methodology  employed  by  Card, 
Heining e Kline (2013) and conclude that differences in firm’s rents explained all the declining relative 
wages of outsourced workers.  

So,  the  previous  studies  consistently  estimated  negative  average  impacts  of  outsourcing  on 
workers’ wages and associated then with differences in non-competitive rents captured by those workers, 
relying mostly on fixed-effect estimates. These conclusions are congruent with recent empirical findings, 
derived  from  the  works  of  Abowd,  Kramarz  and  Margolis  (1999),  Card,  Heining  and  Kline  (2013)  and 
Song et al. (2016). 
 
Song et al. (2016), in particular, decomposed the variance of income and concluded that the most 
important fraction in the increased country inequality (more than two-thirds) is attributed to the increased 
inequality between firms, and not between workers in the same firm. Further yet, they show this process 
is mostly due to a larger segregation of workers in different companies. 
 
They suggest outsourcing may be a relevant factor in explaining this process. However, they claim 
that  simply  dividing  workers  into  more  and  less  productive  would  not  alter  income  distribution  if  they 
were  paid  in  equivalence  to  their  marginal  productivity  in  both  cases.  In  these  terms,  the  uncovered 
difference in rents by difference outsource workers may help explaining these patterns in wage inequality. 
This  paper  further  explores  the  previous  insights  in  mainly  two  dimensions.  First,  we  develop  a 
concrete  theoretical  explanation  for  the  difference  in  rents  appropriated  by  workers.  Second,  we 
systematically  explore  how  outsourcing  effects  varies  both  theoretically  and  empirically  for  different 
workers.            
                                                           
1  The  work  considers  as  outsourcing  any  type  of  service  related  to  production  and  transferred  to  a  third  party.  Thus,  the 
database includes workers on different levels of human capital. For example, it considers  consulting as a type of outsourcing. 

In  this  section,  first  Belchior  and  Bertussi  (2016)’s  model  will  be  replicated,  and  then  it  will  be

the utility function: 

The  economy  under  consideration  has  n  identical  workers  whose  preferences  are  represented  by 

 

𝑢 = 𝑤 − 𝜀 

 

(1) 

where 𝑤 is the wage perceived by the workers and 𝜀 indicates their level of effort. We will assume that 
the worker can perform on two levels of effort – high and low. The variable 𝜀 will assume value 1 if the 
worker performs on high effort, and value 0 if they perform on low effort.  
Workers  receive  unemployment  insurance  of  value  𝑤̅   if  they  are  not  working,  which  acts  as  a 
 
reservation  wage.  Their  effort  is  not  perfectly  observable.  In  case  the  effort  is  not  being  made,  the 
employer observes this behavior with a probability of 𝑝. If the workers are caught shirking, they are fired. 
  
The benefits are evaluated by the workers according to the expected utility theory. If they perform 
with high effort, 𝜀 assumes value 1, so they will not be submitted to uncertainty and their utility will be:  

 

𝑢𝑒 = 𝑤 − 1 

 
Conversely, if they show low effort their utility will be: 

 

 

 
 

𝑢𝑛 = 𝑤 ∗ 𝑝 + (1 − 𝑝) ∗ 𝑤 

This way, it can be assured that the workers will exert effort if, and only if: 

 𝑤 ≥ 𝑤 +

operating under perfect competition and with the objective function given by:

𝜋 = (1 + 𝛿𝜀) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛) − (𝐶 + 𝑤) ∗ 𝑛,      𝛿 > 0 

(5) 

 
where 𝑆(𝑛) is a strictly concave revenue function for the firms, 𝑛 is the amount of workers hired and 𝐶 
represents costs associated to labor management (social charges, labor management costs, etc). It can be 
noted that when the workers make an effort (so that 𝜀 assumes a value of 1) the firms’ revenue function is 
moved up by a positive factor (1 + 𝛿), where 𝛿 is the increment factor of the revenue curve by effort.  
 

It helps to define the derivative of the inverse revenue function as:  

 

 

𝑆′(𝑛)−1 = 𝜑(𝑛)

in such a way as to not encourage workers to make an effort. In this case, we have:

When the firm pays high enough salaries to induce workers to exert effort (so that  𝜀 assumes the

(10) 

 
If the shift in productivity is big enough, it will compensate the increase in wage costs, and firms will opt 
for paying the efficiency wage. 
Now, an additional firm2 that provides outsourced labor to  the firms  producing the  final  good is 
 
introduced.  It  is  assumed  to  be  more  efficient  than  others  in  executing  labor  management,  without 
incurring  cost  𝐶.  Additionally,  said  cost  is  supposed  to  be  reduced  to  zero,  in  order  to  facilitate  further 
mathematical development on the model.  
 
The outsourcing firm pays a high enough wage to attract the workforce, and then passes it on to 
the other companies for a value 𝑤𝑜, in a similar outsourced labor supply model to the one proposed by 
Holmes e Snider (2011). It will receive unitary profit: 

 

𝑤𝑜 − 𝑤 > 0 

 

(11) 

An  important  point  is  that  labor  outsourcing  firms  have  no  incentive  for  paying  the  efficiency 

 
wage, since they cannot benefit directly from the increase in labor productivity, and it raises costs.  
 
they hire outsourced labor: 

Now, firms can maximize their profit in three different  states of nature, including the one where 

 

𝜋 = 𝑆(𝑛𝑡) − 𝑤𝑜 ∗ 𝑛𝑡 

max

𝑛𝑡

 
which gives us, optimally,  

 

𝑛𝑡 = 𝜑(𝑤𝑜) 

 

(12) 

(13) 

 
As  with  the  efficiency  wage  case,  the  referred  paper  denotes  that,  for  a  sufficiently  large  cost 
reduction, the contracting of outsourced labor increases the profitability of firms. It also reduces the wage 
and  productivity  of  workers,  since  they  are  not  encouraged  to  deliver  a  high  level  of  effort  through  the 
efficiency wage payment. 

                                                           
2 The hypothesis that outsourcing firms operate as a monopoly is consistent with the work of Baccara (2007). 

3.2 Various sectors 
In this subsection, we will keep the hypothesis that workers are identical and that there is only one 
 
final good in the economy. It shall be assumed, however, that some firms have introduced exogenously a 
new supervision method, which makes it easier to observe the workers’ effort3. This framework is hoped 
to mimic different grades of observation on the effort of workers from various sectors of an economy. 
 
of 𝑝̅, so that: 

Supposing a fraction of the existing firms is able to observe the workers’ effort with a probability 

 

 

 
 

𝑝̅ > 𝑝 

The problem for these firms when they induce workers to exert effort is: 

𝜋̅ 𝑒 = (1 + 𝛿) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛̅𝑒) − (𝐶 + 𝑤) ∗ 𝑛̅𝑒 

max

𝑛

(14) 

 

(15) 

𝑠. 𝑎                          𝑤 ≥ 𝑤̅ +

1
𝑝̅

 

 

 
One can notice that, since it is easier for the employer to observe the worker’s effort, the threat of 
resignation in case they do not make an effort becomes more believable. Therefore, the wage required to 
induce effort is lower than in the previous case.  
 

Optimal contracting for this firm will imply: 

 

(1 + 𝛿) ∗ 𝑆′(𝑛̅𝑒) = 𝐶 + 𝑤̅ +

𝐶 + 𝑤̅ +

  ⇨ 𝑛̅𝑒 = 𝜑 (

1 + 𝛿

1
𝑝̅

1
𝑝̅

) 

 

(16) 

 
 
In this case, the efficiency wage paid is lower and the impacts on productivity are the same, so we 
can conclude that these new firms are raising their profits more than the rest. Besides, it being shown to 
be  profitable  to  apply  efficiency  wage  for  firms  with  more  difficulty  to  observe  effort,  under  the  same 
assumptions it is also assuredly worth it for new firms to encourage workers’ effort. 
 
We  now  introduce  again  the  possibility  that  the  firm  outsources  labor.  Noticeably,  the  firm’s 
optimization when utilizing outsourced labor does not depend on how easily it can observe its workers’ 
effort.  Thus, the optimization performed by the firm and the optimal  contracting of workers will be the 
same as those described in equations (12) and (13). 
 
 

 
For a small enough 𝑤𝑜, it is possible that:  

 

(1 + 𝛿) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛̅𝑒) − 𝑆(𝑛𝑡) < 𝑛̅𝑒 ∗ (𝐶 + 𝑤̅ +

1
𝑝̅

) − 𝑛𝑡 ∗ 𝑤𝑜 

(17) 

 
which  ensures  that  profits  from  both  types  of  firm  will  be  greater  in  case  they  outsource  labor.  The 
addition of one more type of firm does not change the model’s key characteristic, that outsourced workers 
do not receive efficiency wages. 
 

The wage gap between outsourced and non-outsourced workers is defined as: 

 

𝐺 = 𝑤 − 𝑤𝑡 

(18) 

                                                           
3 Since they operate in a competitive market, an explicit short-term analysis will be conducted. This will make it possible for 
two companies with different production methods and cost functions to coexist in the market.  

 
where 𝑤𝑡 is the wage received by the outsourced workers. In the case of the original firms, the gap is: 

 

 

 

  

 

 𝐺 =

1
𝑝

 

 

As for the ones with the new supervision method, the wage gap is given by: 

𝐺̅ =

1
𝑝̅

 

 

From that, given the restriction imposed by equation (14), we can guarantee that: 

1
𝑝̅

<

1
𝑝

  ⇨ 𝐺̅ < 𝐺 

(19) 

(20) 

(21) 

From this framework, one can observe a negative relationship between the increase in probability 

 
 
of detecting lack of effort in a sector and the wage gap in that same sector.  
 
3.3 Various individuals 
 
In this subsection, we go back to envisioning only one type of firm in the economy. Additionally, 
one more type of worker is brought in to the analysis. We shall now assume there is a fraction of high-
skilled  workers  in  this  economy.  These  workers,  as  well  as  the  low-skilled  ones,  can  execute  a  high  or 
low level of effort. Nevertheless, they will be assumed to be more productive and to bring a higher return 
rate for the firm from their effort. This will be inserted in the model, and 𝜀 will now assume values 1 and 
2. 
 
Such modeling allows productivity disparities of workers to be added to the model. Note that the 
individual  incurs  costs  (in  this  case,  higher  effort)  to  increase  their  productivity,  in  a  similar  way  to 
investment in human capital by individuals4.  
The firm is assumed to be capable of distinguishing high-skilled from low-skilled workers (those 
 
able to execute higher effort and be more productive, and those less able to do that). Nonetheless, it still 
cannot perfectly observe the level of effort achieved by individuals. So, it will observe with a probability 
of p whether a high-skilled individual is showing low effort (so that 𝜀 = 1) and dismiss them if that is the 
case.    
 

When high-skilled individuals do not make an effort, their well-being is given by:  

 

𝑛 = 𝑤 ∗ 𝑝 + (1 − 𝑝) ∗ (𝑤𝑞 − 1) 
𝑢𝑞

 
and, when they do: 

 

𝑒 = 𝑤𝑞 − 2 
𝑢𝑞

 

where subscript q indicates a reference to high-skilled workers. 
 

Workers will exert effort if: 

 

𝑒 ≥ 𝑢𝑞
𝑢𝑞

𝑛 ⇨ 𝑤𝑞 ≥ 𝑤̅ +

1
𝑝

+ 1 

(22) 

(23) 

(24) 

 
                                                           
4 Despite the resemblance, we opted for not making the decision of investment in human capital endogenous, in order to keep 
the simplicity of the model. 

 
Evidently,  the  required  wage  for  high-skilled  workers  to  exert  effort  is  higher  than  the  one 
required for the low-skilled, as stated in equation (4). This fits the empirical observation that high-skilled 
workers have a higher reservation wage (KRUEGER and MUELLER, 2016). 
 

The new objective function for the firms is:  

 

𝜋 = (1 + 𝛿𝜀𝑛𝑞) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛𝑛𝑞) + (1 + 𝛿𝜀𝑞) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛𝑞) − (𝐶 + 𝑤𝑛𝑞) ∗ 𝑛𝑛𝑞 − (𝐶 + 𝑤𝑞) ∗ 𝑛𝑞 

(25) 

  
where subscript 𝑛𝑞 indicates a reference to low-skilled workers. 
 

Supposing that 

 

(1 + 2𝛿) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛𝑞

𝑒) − (1 + 𝛿) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛𝑞) > (𝐶 + 𝑤̅) ∗ (𝑛𝑞

𝑒 − 𝑛𝑞) + 𝑛𝑞

𝑒 +

  
is valid, it is ensured the firm will also pay efficiency wage to high-skilled workers. 
problem for firms is:

(26) 

Therefore,

                         𝑤𝑞 ≥ 𝑤̅ +

The solving of the firm maximization problem yields: 

𝑆′(𝑛𝑞

𝑒 = 𝜑 (

𝐶 + 𝑤̅ +

𝑝
1 + 2𝛿

) 

 

 

(27) 

 

(28) 

 
The optimal choice for low-skilled workers, in turn, is similar to the one obtained in equation (10). 
 
More  productive  workers  receive  higher  wages  than  their  low-skilled  peers.  In  the  model,  this  occurs 
because effort is more costly for productive individuals, and employers are willing to pay a higher wage 
in exchange for a bigger effort from them.  
 
Now, the possibility of labor outsourcing by the firms will be introduced one more time, under the 
terms of the previous subsections. A firm that outsources labor has access both to high-skilled and low-
skilled  labor.  It  pays  reservation  wages  to  every  type  of  individual,  but  renders  its  services  to  the  firm 
producing  the  final  good  at  distinct  prices,  so  that  high-skilled  labor  costs  more  than  low-skilled  labor. 
Keeping the premises from previous subsections and assuming that

𝑒) − (1 + 𝛿) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛𝑞

We  therefore  conclude  that  the  gap  between  outsourced  and  non-outsourced  workers  must  be 

 
 
larger for high-skilled individuals than for low-skilled individuals. 
  
4. Empirical analysis 
 
Our model yields two clear empirical predictions. First, we expect that the wage gap of outsourced 
workers will be higher for more productive workers - witch contradicts some of the insights provided by 
previous papers. Second, our model predicts that the gap will be greater in sectors where it is difficult to 
observe effort. 
 
In  the  following  sections  we  will  analyze  only  the  first  empirical  prediction  of  our  theoretical 
model. As will be discussed in subsection 4.2, we can use occupation and sector detailed classifications to 
identify which workers are outsourced, but we frequently cannot tell which final firms effectively employ 
the worker. This prevents us from testing the second prediction above.      
 
4.1 Econometric model 
 

Seeking to test the model’s predictions, the following mincer equation will be estimated first: 

 

ln(𝑤𝑖) = 𝛼𝑇𝑖 + 𝑿𝒊𝜷 + 𝑢𝑖 

(34) 

 
We  take  the  natural  logarithm  of  the  wage  of  individual  i  (𝑤𝑖)  as  function  of  a  variable  that 
 
indicates whether the worker is outsourced (𝑇𝑖) and a vector of control variables (𝑿𝒊). We wish to assess 
whether  outsourced  workers  earn  less,  once  relevant  cofactors  are  controlled,  such  as  the  previously 
reviewed empirical studies did. 
 
Next,  the  quantile  regression  framework  will  be  used  to  examine  wage  distribution  among 
individuals,  conditional  to  outsourcing  and  other  cofactors  in  several  quantiles  of  earning  distribution. 
Let: 

 

   

ln(𝑤𝑖) = 𝑦𝑖 

(35) 

and 

 

 

 
 

𝛼𝑇𝑖 + 𝜷𝑿𝒊 = 𝒛𝒊 

Formally, the quantile regression will be estimated by: 

min
𝜷,𝜶

∑ 𝜃 ∗ |ln(𝑤𝑖) − 𝛼𝑇𝑖 − 𝜷𝑿𝒊| + ∑ (1 − 𝜃) ∗ |ln(𝑤𝑖) − 𝛼𝑇𝑖 − 𝜷𝑿𝒊|
𝑖:𝑦≥𝑧

𝑖:𝑦≤𝑧

 

(36) 

(37) 

 

where 𝜃 indicates the quantile of analysis. We obtain a coefficient vector that minimizes the equation in 
the desired quantiles and corresponds to the conditional mean of the variables of interest in the quantile 𝜃 
(KOENKER  and  BASSET,  1978;  KOENKER  and  HALLOCK,  2001).  This  analysis  will  allow  a  very 
detailed  decomposition  of  how  outsourcing  affects  the  wages  of  workers  with  different  productivities. 
This has not been achieved yet, in any Brazilian or international study.  
 
4.2 Database 
 
We  will  employ  micro-data  from  the  Annual  Social  Information  Report  (RAIS)  for  2014.  This 
data  is  annually  reported  for  nearly  all  formal  firms  in  Brazil  and  used  it  is  used  for  social  security 
purposes. The misreport of information is subject to penalty, so most firms use specialist accountants to 
register the information (ALVAREZ et al, 2017). 

RAIS  contains  information  on  several  demographical  characteristics  of  individuals  and  some 
characteristics  of  the  firm  in  which  he  is  employed.  Despite  that,  the  database  does  not  divide  the 
information  for  outsourced  and  non-outsourced  workers.  In  order  to  overcome  this  issue,  we  use  the 
method suggested by Dube e Kaplan (2010) for the CPS in the U.S.     
 
Said  method has been proposed by  Belchior  e Bertussi (2016) and consists of cross-linking data 
from  the  Brazilian  Classification  of  Occupations  (CBO)  and  the  National  Classification  of  Economic 
Activity (CNAE). They take advantage of the specificity of those classifications and identify outsourced 
workers in a very broad selection of sectors.  
 
Also,  we  will  use  a  identified  version  of  the  database,  provided  by  the  Work  and  Employment 
Ministry (MTE) for the purpose of research. This particular version of the database contains information 
that allow us to identify firms and individuals across time.    
 
Thereby, we will initially be working with about 50 million observations in the database, the size 
of the Brazilian formal sector. Nonetheless, we could not use it entirely, as the estimation of the quantile 
regression  (described  in  the  last  subsection)  becomes  computationally  unfeasible  with  that  number  of 
observations.  In  order  to  solve  this  problem,  we  created  a  random  sub-sample  with  250  thousand 
observations5 from the original database. The process to attain this sub-sample is described in Appendix 
II.  
 
4.3 Description of the Variables 
Our dependent variable is the natural logarithm of employee remuneration in December 20146. In 
 
opposition to prior estimates, which used the average workers’ remuneration along the year, we chose to 
use just the remuneration for the last month of the year. That is because the statements that compose the 
database are  given by  employers,  and they tend  to  fill  in  recent  information  more accurately (RAMOS, 
2012).  

 

                                                           
5 Once it became evident that the quantile regression estimation would not be feasible with the full sample, we created several 
random samples with reduced number of observations. Starting with one million, we progressively diminished the sample until 
it  became  estimable,  at  a  number  of  250  thousand  observations.  We  performed  the  regressions  on  Table  1  with  our  random 
sub-sample,  and  results  were  very  similar  to  those  found  using  the  entire  database.  Besides,  as  will  be  detailed  in  the  next 
section, this sub-sample is large enough to make sure all the estimated coefficients are significant to the level of 1% in any of 
the quantiles. 
6 Workers who were dismissed throughout the year were excluded from the sample. 

 
The  control  vector  is  formed  by  the  following  variables:  education;  age  (on  level  and  squared); 
experience in the firm the worker is employed at (on level and squared); geographic region they live in; 
sector they work in; gender; ethnicity; and size of reported establishment. 
 
The education variable, measured by the maximum level of instruction achieved, aims to control 
the  individuals’  difference  in  productivity7.  According  to  human  capital  theory,  prevalent  in  the 
explanation of individuals’ varying remunerations, this should be a very  relevant  factor to  the observed 
wage variation (BECKER, 1975).  
 
The  adding  of  age  and  experience  at  current  job  variables,  used  as  proxy  for  the  individual’s 
experience  in  the  work  market,  seeks  to  identify  the  presence  of  specific  human  capital,  acquired  with 
time in  the job.  A quadratic term  was included to detect  non-linear relationships within the experience-
wage  relation,  since  the  productivity  gains  generated  are  exhausted  over  time  (ARROW,  1962).  The 
variables are measured in months and point to how long the individual has worked for the same company.
 
Binary  variables  are  added  to  control  regional  segmentations  in  wage  determination  or 
discrimination  patterns  against  minorities.  The  Northeast  region  was  taken  as  reference  and  dummy 
variables  were  assigned  for  the  other  regions.  The  ethnicity  binary  variable  assumes  value  1  if  the 
individual is white, and value 0 if they belong to any other ethnic group. We also used a binary variable to 
identify  outsourced  and  non-outsourced  workers,  according  to  the  classification  discussed  in  the  last 
subsection. 
 
At  last,  we  added  establishment  size  to  the  regression  as  an  indicator  for  the  propensity  of  the 
individual to receive an efficiency wage (OI and IDSON, 1999). The size of the company is defined by 
the number of workers, according to the rating recommended by SEBRAE (2013) when using data from 
RAIS8. 
 
4.4 Results 
 
In  Table  1,  an  estimation  of  equation  (34)  is  performed.  In  model  (1),  we  only  perform  the 
regression of the wage logarithm’s variable  as a  function of the outsourcing dummy  variable.  In  model 
(2),  are  included  in  the  regression  controls  of  education,  experience  (on  level  and  squared)  and  age  – 
consistent  with  human  capital  theory,  without  discrimination  or  segmentation  in  the  labor  market. 
Ultimately, in model (3) all aforementioned variables are included.

enterprise (50 to 99 employees) and big enterprise (more than 100 employees).

outsourced ones. In model (2), we see that most of this penalty can be explained by the addition of control 
variables. The wage difference estimated in the second model  
is 13.8%. In model (3), after adding the 
whole vector of control variables, the estimation for the gap goes up again, to 14.6%. 
 
The  estimation  pattern  is  consistent  with  that  attained  by  Brazilian  studies,  which  assessed  the 
impact of outsourcing on wage; but the estimates for the gap are higher in all three models and closer to 
the ones achieved by international work. 
 
The results for the quantile regression in the other quantiles are available in Appendix III10.  
           

In Table 2 are arranged the results of the estimation of equation (37) for quantiles 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9.

In order to synthesize the results of these estimates, Chart 2 illustrates the estimated coefficient for 

 
the percentage impact of outsourcing on wages in each quantile. 
 

Chart 1 – Marginal impact of outsourcing on individuals’ wage by income quantile. 

 

 

 
We can see that the estimated values for outsourcing are negative in all of the quantiles, and the 
negative  impact  of  outsourcing  becomes  progressively  larger  according  to  the  income.  Such  estimates 
provide  empirical  support  to  our  model’s  prediction  that  more  productive  workers  (and,  consequently, 
with higher wages) suffer relatively more with outsourcing than less productive ones.

occupational status that drove our previous results. This section tries to account for that. 
 
5.1 New Database 
 
In this section we use a confidential version of the RAIS database, described in subsection 4.2, for 
the  years  of  2009  and  2010.  Unlike  the  previous  database,  this  version  contains  an  individual  unique 
identifier for all workers, which allow us to follow each individual in time. 
Instead of working with all individuals, we restrict the database in 2010 only to those individuals 
 
who were outsourced (defined in the same way as described in section 4), obtaining approximately four 
and a half million observations. 
 
Then, we match those individuals with the database for the previous year. We have been able to 
match a little less than four million individuals, approximately 86,7% of all outsourced workers in 201011. 
In this subsample, around one and a half million  individuals were not outsourced in 2009. 
 
Since  all  the  workers  in  the  new  database  were  outsourced  in  2010,  we  expect  that  all  the 
individuals in this subsample will have much similar characteristics and, therefore, the workers who were 
outsourced in 2010 and were not in 2009 constitute a much better counter-factual than the one used in the 
previous section. Next, we will re-estimate some of the previous equations with our new database. 
 
5.2 Results  
 
table 1, for our new database: 
 

In table 3, we present the results for our estimates for equation (34), similar to those displayed in 

Table 3 – Results of our GLS regression (34) using our new sample 

 

 

 
We  can  see  that  the  raw  gap  between  outsourced  workers  is  drastically  smaller  in  model  (1)  of 
table 3 than the estimated in table 1 – only -4,2%. Once we add additional control variables, the estimated 
gap increases to  approximately  -7,9%, which is  still smaller than the  respective models in table  1. This 
results points out  that, in fact,  unobserved characteristics seem  to  explain a large part of the outsourced 
wage gap.    
 
presented in Table 4.  

Next we re-estimate equation (37)12 for our database for quantiles 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9. The results are 

                                                           
11  The  non  matched  workers  were  not  in  the  formal  market  in  2009.  The  rate  of  matched  individuals  achieved  with  this 
procedure is very similar to the matching using all formal workers done by Belchior and Bertussi (2016).    
12 Again, the estimation of the quantile regression was not computationally feasible even with the drastic reduction of the new 
database size. Therefore, we applied the same method described in apendix II to obtain a new random subsample of our new 
database.

Table 4 – Results of the quantile regression (37) for quantiles 0.1, 0.5 (medium regression) and 0.9 in our subsample. 

 

 
 
First,  we  note  that,  when  we  control  for  selection  bias,  the  wage  gap  is  still  negative  and 
statistically  significant  at  the  one  percent  level  for  the  three  quantiles.  The  magnitude  of  the  wage  gap, 
however,  is  smaller  than  the  previous  in  all  three  estimates  –  also  indicating  the  importance  of 
unobservable  effects.  This  effect  seems  to  be  relatively  stronger  for  low  productive  workers  as  the 
estimation for the (0.1) quantile got severely closer to zero and the estimation for the (0.9) quantile was 
much closer to the original result. 
In  Chart  2,  we  present  the  estimates  for  the  marginal  impact  of  outsourcing  on  wages  on  each 
 
quantile in order to summarize our results. Also, for comparative purposes, we plot the previous results 
for the quantile regression displayed in Chart 2.

quantile regression results as a baseline (black) 

 

 
The  graph  confirms  the  previous  conclusions  drawn  from  Table  4.  The  entire  distribution  was 
dragged up as we controlled for the unobservable characteristics. The effect, of course, is not the same for 
different individuals. The coefficient for the poorest workers is slightly positive, despite not economically 
or statistically significant, while for the richer individuals the coefficient is statistically indifferent for our 
previous estimates. We argue that there must be unobservable individual characteristics, undesirable from 
the  viewpoint  of  the  employer,  that  affect  the  occupational  status  of  the  workers.  Although  this 
characteristics  seem  to  be  present  in  all  distribution,  they  appear  to  be  far  more  important  for  the  less 
productive  individuals.  The  complete  set  of  estimates  for  the  quantile  regression  are  displayed  in 
appendix III.

Conclusion 
This paper aimed to assess distinct impacts of outsourcing on different groups of workers. When 
 
reviewing  the  literature  on  the  theme,  we  noticed  few  studies  have  made  an  evaluation  of  the 
consequences  of  outsourcing  for  different  groups  of  workers,  whereas  none  have  made  systematic 
differentiations by workers or by income.     
 
We  built  a  theoretical  model  that  expands  the  framework  developed  by  previous  works,  to  an 
economy  with  more  than  one  sector  and  more  than  one  type  of  worker.  The  model  suggests  the  gap 
between outsourced and non-outsourced workers must be larger for more productive workers, as well as 
for those who work at sectors where effort observation is harder. 
 
Next,  we  used  RAIS’s  2014  micro-data,  along  with  a  similar  procedure  to  the  one  suggested  by 
Dube  e  Kaplan  (2010)  to  distinguish  outsourced  and  non-outsourced  workers.  Starting  by  conducting 
estimates on the average impact of outsourcing on wages, we concluded that once all control variables are 
used,  outsourced  workers  earn  about  14.5%  less  than  their  counterparts.  Values  found  are  higher  than 
previously estimated for Brazil, becoming closer to American and European estimates. 
 
Then, a quantile regression was conducted to evaluate the impact of outsourcing on workers with 
different  income  levels  (and  therefore  different  productivities).  It  concluded  that  the  impact  of 
outsourcing on wages grows progressively with income, as suggested by the theoretical model. 
 
Clearly the previous results might be driven by an unobservable form of selection. Trying to deal 
with that, we use a confidential version of the RAIS database for the years of 2009 and 2010. We restrict 
our  sample  to  individuals  in  2009  who  could  be  matched  across  years  and  were  outsourced  in  2010 
sample. Since a lot of those individuals weren't outsourced in 2009 we are able to build a much similar 
control group for our analysis. 
 
Once  we  re-estimated  our  basic  model  with  our  new  database,  we  found  the  the  wage  gap  was 
significant  smaller  when  we  controlled  for  unobserved  characteristics  –  about  7,9%.  Finally,  we  re-
estimated the quantile regression using our new subsample. Our results for the wage gap tend to get near 
zero. This seem to be especially true for low productive workers. For the poorer workers in our dataset, 
for example, we obtained an estimate statistically indifferent from zero while the previous result indicated 
a wage penalty of almost 6%. Alternatively, for the most productive workers the estimates for the wage 
gap  are  similar  with  the  previous  results,  around  15%.  Still,  the  results  get  progressively  bigger  as  the 
worker's income grows, which is consistent with our model. Overall, this paper suggests that outsourcing 
tends to have negative impact on the wages of a great variety of workers. In addition, the segmentation of 
the analysis endorses the efficiency wage model suggested in this study.

The  following  table,  developed  by  Belchior  and  Bertussi  (2016),  indicates  the  occupations 
commonly  considered  as  outsourced,  as  well  as  the  sectors  associated  to  them,  implying  the  worker’s 
occupational status.

Appendix II – Creation of a Random Sub-sample 
 
 
The random sub-sample was created using the pseudo-random number generator KISS, available 
in the 13th version of statistic software Stata. To carry out this procedure, first the seed s was established 
in  order to  allow the replication of the randomization process.  The seed  used was 45002494 in  the first 
quantile regression and 98173938 for the second.  
 
distribution with extreme values 0 and 1: 

Next, we attributed a random value to each observation in the database, extracted from a uniform 

 𝑋~𝑈(0,1) 

 
Subsequently, the samples from the database were rearranged in ascending order according to the 
value attributed to  them, from  the previous distribution. Finally, the random  sub-sample was defined as 
the  first  250  thousand  observations  from  the  database  after  the  rearrangement.  The  full  sequence  of 
commands is: 
 
set seed s
