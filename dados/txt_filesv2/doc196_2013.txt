Abstract
This paper measures the impact of the Priority Municipalities, a policy that increases monitoring on mu-
nicipalities listed, on Brazilian Amazon deforestation. This policy, theoretically, applies a cost to bad
environmental behavior in a more centralized way, as the sanction shifts from the household to the munic-
ipality level. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that priority status may have generated political pressure
for politicians, credit agents, and commodity industry agents. We ﬁnd an important and negative effect of
Priority Municipalities on deforestation. We also ﬁnd that, when controlling for the monitoring intensity,
the priority status has zero effect, which means that the other mechanisms (such as political pressure and
other economic sanctions) seem to have no signiﬁcant effect on deforestation.

RESUMO

Este trabalho mede o impacto dos Municípios Prioritários, uma política que aumenta a ﬁscalização nos mu-
nicípios listados, sobre o desmatamento da Amazônia. Esta política, em tese, aplica um custo para desvios
de conduta ambiental de uma forma mais centralizada, já que a sanção passa do nível do estabelecimento
ao nível do município. Evidências anedóticas também sugerem que o status de prioridade pode ter gerado
pressão política para os políticos, agentes de crédito, e os agentes do setor de commodities. Encontramos
um efeito importante e negativo dos municípios prioritários em desmatamento. No entanto, ao controlar
pela intensidade no monitoramento, o efeito sobre o desmatamento passa a ser zero, o que signiﬁca que os
outros mecanismos (como pressão política e outras sanções econômicas) parecem não ter qualquer efeito
signiﬁcativo.

1. Introduction

The Amazon is the world’s largest rainforest, stretching over an area of more than 5 million square
kilometers. In Brazil, the forest originally occupied over 4 million square kilometers – an area equivalent to
almost half of continental Europe. Today, around 80% of the Brazilian Amazon remains covered by native
vegetation, making it an important carbon sink. Moreover, the Brazilian Amazon holds unique biodiversity
and 20% of the planet’s fresh water (MMA (2012)). Protecting the Amazon from illegal deforestation and
enforcing environmental regulation in the region is a challenge as immense as the forest itself. Yet, the pace
of forest clearings appears to have lost momentum in recent years. Amazon deforestation rates escalated
in the early 2000s, but after peaking at over 27,000 square kilometers in 2004, decreased sharply to about
5,000 square kilometers in 2011 (INPE (2012)).

There is a substantial stream of literature documenting the drivers of deforestation in the Amazon, such
as population, road density, and agroclimatic characteristics (Pfaff (1999), Chomitz and Thomas (2003),
Reis and Guzmán (1994), Reis and Margulis (1991)). However, there is scarce empirical evidence on
the immediate drivers of the recent Amazon deforestation slowdown. Assunção et al. (2012) show that,
even when controlling for commodity prices and relevant ﬁxed effects, conservation policies introduced
in the second half of the 2000s helped avoid over 60,000 square kilometers of forest clearings. Hargrave
and Kis-Katos (2012) and Assunção et al. (2013) ﬁnd a negative relationship between the number of ﬁnes
and deforestation in the Amazon. We contribute to this literature by focusing on the effect of a speciﬁc
monitoring and law enforcement policy.

This paper evaluates the impact of the priority municipalities policy introduced in the late 2000s. Im-
plemented by the Ministry of the Environment (MMA) as a means to target law enforcement efforts, this
policy introduced differential treatment in terms of economic and political sanctions for municipalities that
exhibited a recent history of intense deforestation activity. Priority status was determined based on three
municipality-level criteria: (i) total deforested area; (ii) total deforested area over the past three years; and
(iii) increase in the deforestation rate in at least three of the past ﬁve years. The priority municipalities
policy was implemented as part of the second phase of the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of
Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), the pivotal governmental conservation policy effort of the
mid-2000s. Launched in 2004, the PPCDAm integrated actions across different government institutions
and proposed novel procedures for monitoring, environmental control, and territorial management.

The decree establishing the legal basis for the priority municipalities policy was passed in December
2007, and the ﬁrst thirty-six municipalities to be added to the priority list were announced in January 2008.
In March 2009, seven municipalities were added to the list, and, in March 2011, seven others were also
added.

The priority municipalities were intended as targets for a more stringent system of deforestation mon-
itoring and environmental law enforcement. Any rural establishment located within these municipalities
could be called upon for registry update by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform
(INCRA), the agency responsible for rural households land titles. The Brazilian Institute for the Envi-
ronment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama), which operates as the national environmental police
and law enforcement authority, focused law enforcement activities on priority municipalities, combining
information obtained from INCRA with satellite data on deforestation activity.

In addition, although there is no explicit mention of this type of administrative sanction in the legislation
that regulates the implementation of the priority municipalities policy, anecdotal evidence suggests that
priority status may have generated political pressure for politicians, credit agents, and commodity industry
agents operating in priority municipalities. These pressures would result from changes in economic and
political decisions related to deforestation activity. Examples include, but are not limited to, politicians
pressuring farmers to comply with environmental legislation, big slaughterhouses refusing to buy meat
from irregular producers, and bank managers facilitating access to credit to producers who comply with
environmental legislation.

This paper aims at not only assessing the impact of the creation of priority municipalities on deforesta-
tion, but also identifying the mechanism through which the implemented policy was most effective. Did the

2

policy affect deforestation solely through intensiﬁed monitoring and law enforcement, or did other political
and economic sanctions also play a signiﬁcant role?

We address these questions using a municipality-by-year panel data set from 2002 through 2011. Defor-
estation data is obtained from processed satellite imagery made publicly available by the National Institute
for Space Research (INPE). We use a municipality ﬁxed-effect model using the priority municipality status
dummy as the independent variable of interest. We control for agricultural commodity prices, as well as for
other relevant conservation policies, such as the extent of protected areas and the number of environmental
ﬁnes applied by Ibama at the municipality level.

Results indicate that the priority municipalities policy signiﬁcantly contributed to reduce deforesta-
tion after 2008. The effect is statically signiﬁcant in most speciﬁcations, even when controlling for a
municipality-speciﬁc time trend and other policies (except the number of ﬁnes applied by Ibama). Quan-
titatively, the policy avoided the clearing of 11,218 km2 of forest area from 2008 through 2011. Total
deforestation observed in the same period was 20,689 km2, 35.1% smaller than in the absence of the policy.
However, when adequately controlling for the number of ﬁnes applied by Ibama, the effect of the prior-
ity municipalities disappears. We interpret this as an indication that the relevant mechanism for the priority
municipalities policy impact is improved monitoring and targeting of law enforcement. Other potential
mechanisms, such as political pressure and economic sanctions, seem to have no signiﬁcant effect on defor-
estation when we adequately control for the sanctions directly applied by monitoring and law enforcement
agents.

Our paper is related to two other branches of the economic literature. First, our results contribute to the
literature on the evaluation of effectiveness of environmental monitoring and law enforcement. Gray and
Shimshack (2011) provides a recent survey of this literature. Most studies refer to plant-level environmental
performance, as captured by standard emissions or accidental discharges (see, for example, Epple and Viss-
cher (1984), Magat and Viscusi (1990), Anderson and Talley (1995), Eckert (2004), Gray and Shadbegian
(2005), Shimshack and Ward (2005), and Earnhart and Segerson (2012)). Our paper addresses a different
dimension of environmental monitoring and law enforcement, focusing on the impact of a targeted law
enforcement policy on deforestation.

Second, there is an important literature that discusses decentralized versus centralized provision of
public goods (see Lockwood (2002), Knight (2002), Bardhan and Mookherjee (2000), and Besley and
Coate (2003)). In this paper, we analyze a policy that, theoretically, applies a cost to bad environmental
behavior in a more centralized way, as the sanction shifts from the household to the municipality level.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the institutional context in the time of
the implementation of priority municipalities; Section 3 provides a detailed description of the data used in
the paper; Section 4 explains the empirical strategy used to calculate the impact of priority municipalities
on deforestation; Section 5 discusses the results of the paper; and Section 6 addresses the conclusions and
policy implications of our results.

2. Institutional Context

Monitoring and law enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon is traditionally based on legislation written
establishing rules to rural households. For example, farmers are required to keep at least 80% of their lands
with native vegetation and to keep at least 15 meters os permanent protected areas near to rivers. Ibama uses
these rules to classify certain deforested area as legal or illegal. The priority municipalities were the ﬁrst
attempt to shift the unit of analysis in the monitoring system and in the Ibama’s law enforcement actuation
from the household level to the municipality level, a more centralized way.

Since its creation in February 1989, Ibama has been responsible for environmental monitoring and
law enforcement in Brazil. It both operates as an environmental police force, investigating environmental
infractions and applying administrative sanctions, and executes environmental policy actions concerning
environmental licensing, quality control, and impact, as well as the generation and spread of environmental
information. As the country’s leading ﬁgure in environmental monitoring, Ibama plays a central role in the
control and prevention of Amazon deforestation.

3

The strengthening of command and control has been a key policy effort of the MMA since the launch of
the PPCDAm in the mid-2000s. The creation of the priority municipality targeting system was an important
component of the second phase of the PPCDAm. The signing of Presidential Decree 6,321 in December
2007 established the legal basis for singling out municipalities with intense deforestation activity and taking
differentiated action towards them. These municipalities, classiﬁed based on their recent deforestation
history, were marked as in need of priority action to prevent, monitor, and combat illegal deforestation. Any
Legal Amazon municipality could be added to what became known as the "list of priority municipalities".
Municipality-level selection criteria for this list were: (i) total deforested area; (ii) total deforested area
over the past three years; and (iii) increase in the deforestation rate in at least three of the past ﬁve years.
Exiting the list of priority municipalities was conditioned upon signiﬁcantly reducing deforestation. Issued
in January 2008, MMA Ordinance 28 listed the ﬁrst thirty-six priority municipalities. Seven municipalities
were added to the list in 2009, and another seven in 2011.

Differential action taken in priority municipalities largely consisted of more rigorous environmental
monitoring and law enforcement. Ibama monitored the municipalities more closely and dedicated a larger
share of its resources to them. Licensing and georeferencing requirements for rural establishments were
harsher in priority municipalitites, and, in an effort to identify fraudulent documents and illegal occupations,
private land titles were to be revised.

In addition to concentrating a large share of Ibama’s attention and monitoring efforts, priority munici-
palities also became subject to a series of other administrative measures that did not necessarily stem from
command and control policy. Although not ofﬁcially established through legislation, these measures im-
posed an additional cost to being in the MMA’s priority list. Examples include, but are not limited to,
compromised political reputation for mayors of priority municipalities and economic sanctions applied by
agents of the commodity industry.

3. Data, Descriptive Statistics, and Stylized Facts

This section introduces the data used in our empirical evaluation of Resolution 3,545, presents descrip-

tive statistics, and discusses stylized facts to characterize aggregate trends for our variables of interest.

3.1. Deforestation

Data on deforestation is built from satellite-based images that are processed at the municipality level
and publicly released by PRODES/INPE. Because PRODES data is reported annually, we ﬁrst convert our
municipality-by-month credit panel into a municipality-by-year credit panel. We deﬁne deforestation as
the annual deforestation increment, that is, the area in square kilometers of forest cleared over the twelve
months leading up to August of a given year.1

For any given municipality, cloud cover during the period of remote sensing may compromise the accu-
racy of satellite images, requiring images to be produced at a different time. As a result, image records for
different years may span from less to more than twelve months. To control for measurement error, variables
indicating unobservable areas are included in all regressions. This data is also publicly available at the
municipality-by-year level from PRODES/INPE.

To smoothen the cross-sectional variation in deforestation that arises from municipality size heterogene-
ity, we use a normalized measure of the annual deforestation increment. The normalization ensures that our
analysis considers relative variations in deforestation increments within municipalities. The variable is
constructed according to the following expression:

Def orestit =

ADIit − ADI it

sd (ADIit)

(1)

1More precisely, the annual deforestation increment of year t measures the area in square kilometers deforested between the 1st
of August of t − 1 and the 31st of July of t.

4

where Def orestit is the normalized annual deforestation increment for municipality i and year t; ADIit is
the annual deforestation increment measured in municipality i between the 1st of August of t−1 and the 31st
of July of t; and ADI it and sd (ADIit) are, respectively, the mean and the standard deviation of the annual
deforestation increment calculated for each i over the 2002 through 2011 period. The variable ADIit
replaces Def orestit in robustness checks. Our sample does not include municipalities that showed no
variation in deforestation throughout the sample years, as this variation is needed to calculate the normalized
variable.

The ﬁnal data set containing information on deforestation, rural credit, time, and geographic variables at
the municipality-by-year level is used to estimate the effects of the credit restriction on deforestation. Again,
we do not include municipalities crossed by the biome frontier. The full sample comprises X Amazon
Biome municipalities.

3.2. Law Enforcement

We use the total number of ﬁnes applied as sanctions for environmental crimes in each municipality as a
measure of the intensity of monitoring and law enforcement at the municipality level. The data are publicly
available from Ibama.

It is worth highlighting that the knowingly low collection rates for environmental ﬁnes applied in Ama-
zon municipalities do not interfere with our analysis (Hirakuri (2003), Brito and Barreto (2008), ?, Brito
(2009)). These ﬁnes are often accompanied by other sanctioning instruments that are more binding, such
as seizure and destruction of production goods, tools and materials, and embargoes of production areas.
Because panel data for the use of these instruments are not available, we use the number of ﬁnes as a proxy
for command and control efforts as a whole. Essentially, we are interested in exploring ﬁnes as a means of
capturing the effect of environmental police (Ibama) presence – not of the sanctioning instrument itself –
on deforestation.
To maintain consistency across our panel data, we consider the PRODES year – August 1st, t−1 through
July 31st, t – as the relevant unit of time in our sample. Thus, for each municipality, the total number of ﬁnes
in a given year captures all ﬁnes applied in that municipality in the twelve months leading up to August of
that year.

3.3. Cloud Coverage

Georeferenced data on deforestation activity produced by the satellite-based Real-Time Detection of
Deforestation (DETER) system are used to identify deforestation hot spots and issue alerts that serve to
target law enforcement activity. Figure 1 shows examples of maps containing both cloud coverage and
alerts captured by DETER. In addition to portraying the high degree of within-year variation in DETER
cloud coverage, the ﬁgure also clearly illustrates DETER’s inability to detect land cover pattern in areas
covered by clouds – typically, no deforestation activity is captured and no deforestation alerts are issued
in these areas. This supports the perception that the allocation of Ibama personnel is directly affected by
DETER cloud coverage, such that law enforcers are less likely to be present in areas that are systematically
under greater cloud coverage.

We are, then, interested in exploring how DETER cloud coverage affects Ibama presence in the Ama-
zon. To do this, we use georeferenced data from DETER/INPE that map cloud coverage over the Amazon
throughout the year. When visibility is at least partial, these maps show exactly which areas were covered
by clouds (see Figure 1). When visibility is too precarious to derive information about land cover, how-
ever, no map is produced – we assume DETER cloud coverage to be complete in this case. We use the
15-day periodical data to calculate, for each sample municipality and year, average DETER cloud coverage
for that municipality and year both in absolute (square kilometers) and relative (share of total municipality
area) terms. Again, the relevant unit of time is the PRODES year. We use this constructed variable as an
instrument for the number of ﬁnes applied to each Amazon municipality.

Agricultural prices are endogenous to local agricultural production. Thus, to control for ﬂuctuations
pressuring deforestation at the municipality level, we must construct output price series that capture exoge-
nous variations in the demand for agricultural commodities produced locally. As argued in ?, agricultural
commodity prices recorded in the southern Brazilian state of Paraná are highly correlated with average
local crop prices calculated for the Legal Amazon sample municipalities. Hence, we use the Paraná agri-
cultural commodity price series as exogenous indicators of local market conditions within our empirical
context. Prices for beef cattle, soybean, cassava, rice, corn, and sugarcane were collected at the Agriculture
and Supply Secretariat of the State of Paraná (Secretaria de Agricultura e do Abastecimento do Estado do
Paraná, SEAB-PR). Soybean, cassava, rice, and corn are predominant crops in the Legal Amazon in terms
of harvested area. Although not a predominant crop in the region, sugarcane is also included to take into
consideration the recent expansion of Brazilian ethanol biofuel production. Together, the ﬁve crops account
for approximately 70% of total harvested area averaged across sample years.

The Paraná price series are used to build two variables of interest. The ﬁrst of these variables, an annual
index of crop prices, is constructed in three steps. First, we calculate nominal monthly price series for each
calendar year-month and culture. Annual prices are deﬂated to year 2011 BRL and are expressed as an
index with base year 2011.

Second, we calculate a weighted real price for each of the crops according to the following expression:

P P Aitc = P Ptc ∗ Aic,2000−2001

(2)

where P P Aitc is the weighted real price of crop c in municipality i and year t; P Ptc is the Paraná-based
real price of crop c in year t expressed as an index with base year 2000; and Aic,2000−2001 is the share of
municipal area used as farmland for production of crop c in municipality i averaged over the 2000 through
2001 period.2 This latter term captures the relative importance of crop c within municipality i’s agricultural
production in the years immediately preceding the sample periods. It thus serves as a municipality-speciﬁc
weight that introduces cross-sectional variation in the commodity price series.

Third, we use principal component analysis on the weighted real crop prices to derive the annual index
of crop prices. This technique allows the price variations that are common to the ﬁve selected crops to
be represented in one single measure. The resulting index of crop prices captures the ﬁrst principal com-
ponent of the ﬁve weighted real prices. As the index maximizes the price variance, it represents a more
comprehensive measure of the agricultural output price scenario for this analysis than the individual prices
themselves. Moreover, by using the index of crop prices, which absorbs both cross-sectional and time-
speciﬁc trends at the municipality level plausibly correlated with credit demand, we overcome an important
empirical limitation.

The second variable of interest is an annual index of cattle prices, which is derived analogously to
P P Aitc. However, as land pasture is not observable, in this case Aci,2000−2001 is the ratio of heads of cattle
to municipal area in municipality i averaged over the 2000 through 2001 period.

3.5. Rain and other policies

We include a series of variables to control for other potentially relevant determinants of deforestation,

namely rainfall, and other conservation policies.

First, there is no consensus in the literature as to how deforestation and precipitation are related. On
the one hand, forest clearings are often concentrated in dry seasons, when it is easier to penetrate and burn
the forest. On the other hand, the cutting down of forests may itself affect the region’s microclimate and
precipitation patterns (Negri et al. (2004), Aragão et al. (2008), Saad et al. (2010)). Although understanding

2Variables on annual municipality crop production (harvested area, quantum, or value in current prices) are based on data origi-
nally from the Municipal Crop Survey of the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (Pesquisa Agrícola Municipal do
Instituto Brasileiro de Geograﬁa e Estatística, PAM/IBGE).

7

this relationship in detail is out of the scope of this paper, we include a measure of total precipitation in
each sample municipality to account for the effect of rainfall on forest clearing activities. We do so by us-
ing annual precipitation data compiled by Matsuura and Willmott (2012), who draw on worldwide climate
data to calculate a regular georeferenced world grid of estimated precipitation over land. Their estimations
are based on a variety of sources for geographic extrapolations of rainfall data collected at weather sta-
tions. Using this georeferenced grid, we estimate total precipitation in each municipality according to the
following rule: (i) for municipalities that overlap with only one grid node, we use the precipitation value
for that grid node as municipality precipitation; (ii) for municipalities that overlap with two or more grid
nodes, we consider all node values and use their average precipitation as municipality precipitation; (iii) for
municipalities that have no overlap with any grid nodes, we take the area of a 28-kilometer buffer around
the municipality and consider the average precipitation of all grid nodes that fall within this buffer area as
municipality precipitation; and (iv) for the few municipalities whose 28-kilometer buffer do not overlap
with any grid nodes, we use the precipitation value for the nearest grid node as municipality precipitation.3
Finally, we include controls for other relevant conservation policies implemented during the sample
period. In particular, we account for total protected area in each municipality, including both conservation
units and indigenous lands.

4. Empirical Strategy

This section describes the empirical strategy used to identify the causal effect of the priority municipal-
ities policy on Amazon deforestation. As municipalities are included in the list of priority municipalities in
different years, we use a municipality ﬁxed-effects strategy with a dummy indicating if municipality i was a
priority municipality in year t as the independent variable of interest. We also control for year ﬁxed-effects,
for agricultural commodity prices, rainfall, and other relevant conservation policies. We restrict our sample
to municipalities within 300km of the Amazon biome frontier to focus our analysis on the areas where
agricultural development and, consequently, deforestation are most relevant. The main speciﬁcation is:

Def orestationit =γ1P riorityit +

γkXitk + ψi + λt + it

(3)

k

where Def orestationit is the normalized measure of deforestation; P riorityit is a dummy indicating if
municipality i had priority status on year t; Xitk is a vector of controls; ψi is the municipality ﬁxed effect;
λt is the year ﬁxed effect; and it is the idiosyncratic error.

There are some econometric issues that we must account for to ensure validity of our main assump-
tion that priority municipalities are comparable to non-priority ones. They refer to the criterions used to
determine priority status: ﬁrst, total deforested area within a municipality since its creation; second, total
deforested area over the past three years; and, third, increase in the municipality-level deforestation area
in at least three of the past ﬁve years. The way the municipalities are chosen, however, also give us an
opportunity. The criteria of total deforested area over the last 3 years take into account the whole deforested
area. However, the size of the territory within municipality is not token into account. Therefore, we have to
check whether after normalized the deforestation variable is comparable between groups or not.

We address these issues as follows. First, we include ﬁxed effects, such that we only consider variations
in deforested area and account for past deforestation. We also conduct an exercise in which we restrict
our sample to municipalities having at least half of their territory covered by native vegetation in the initial
sample year.

Second, we normalize the deforestation variable, such that the scale of the variation is the same for all
municipalities. Because total deforested area over the last three years is directly inﬂuenced by the absolute
size of the municipality, the normalized variable should be comparable between groups in our speciﬁcations.

3Buffer size was chosen based on the size of grid nodes – 28 kilometers is equivalent to half the distance between grid nodes.

8

(cid:88)

Third, we check if there are differences in pre-trends between treatment and control groups when using
the normalized deforestation variable. We address this question in two ways. First, we build dummy
variables signaling whether each municipality was attributed priority status in each year. We do it ﬁxing
the year before the priority status be attributed as year zero. Then, the dummy indicating one year before
the year zero is labeled as "1 year before the program" and so on. The same logic is used for the dummies
after the program. The pre-treatment dummies are expected to have no signiﬁcant effect if the pre-trends
are alike, and the post-treatment dummies are expected to be negative and signiﬁcant if the policy had a
signiﬁcant effect. To ensure we are not capturing some pre-trend pattern, we also run the main speciﬁcation
controlling for municipality-speciﬁc time trends.

We are also interested in the mechanism through which priority municipalities could have an effect on
deforestation. Thus, we conduct an exercise in which we adequately control for deforestation monitoring
intensity and law enforcement activity following Assunção et al. (2013). The authors instrument the number
of ﬁnes applied by Ibama using DETER cloud coverage. DETER cloud coverage seems to affect the
allocation of law enforcement efforts, but not deforestation directly (except through the rain channel, which
is controlled for). The idea is to check whether, after controlling for law enforcement activity, priority status
will still have an impact on deforestation. If the effect is still present, this means that the other political and
economic sanctions applied in priority municipalities (political pressure, slaughterhouses refusing to buy
meat, and bank managers hampering access to credit) are relevant elements of the policy. On the other hand,
if the effect is no longer present after controlling for the number of ﬁnes, this suggest that priority status
only affects deforestation through improved monitoring and targeting of law enforcement.

5. Results

Table 1 shows the effect of the priority municipalities policy on Amazon deforestation. Column 1
presents coefﬁcients for our main speciﬁcation, as described in Section 4. Column 2 uses a restricted sample
of municipalities with more than half of their territory covered by native vegetation in the ﬁrst sample year.
Column 3 uses total deforested area instead of normalized deforestation as the dependent variable. Column
4 restricts the sample to the years after 2006, to allow for comparison with the regressions we later run
using the number of ﬁnes and DETER cloud coverage (as data on DETER cloud coverage is only available
starting in 2006).

Priority municipalities appears to have a negative and signiﬁcant impact on deforestation. Results are
robust to all speciﬁcations. Quantitatively, counterfactual analysis shows that the policy avoided the clearing
of 11,218 km2 of Amazon forest area in our sample from 2008 through 2011. Total deforestation observed
in the sample in the same period was 20,689 km2, 35.1% smaller than in the absence of the policy.

Table 2 suggests that our results are not coming from differences in pre-policy trends. In Column 1, we
see that only the dummies indicating post-policy priority status have a signiﬁcant effect on deforestation.
The pre-treatment dummies are not statistically signiﬁcants, indicating that different pre-policy trends are
likely not a concern for our speciﬁcations. Even so, in Column 2, we run the main speciﬁcation controlling
for municipality- speciﬁc time trends. The priority municipalities policy still appears to have a signiﬁcant
negative effect on deforestation. Thus, it seems that we are really capturing the policy effect on deforesta-
tion, and not that of unobservables or pre-policy trends.

Finally, we want to investigate the mechanism through which the policy was most effective. To do this,
we run the same regressions as in the Table 1, but control for the number of ﬁnes applied by Ibama, as
instrumented by DETER cloud coverage. Table 3 shows that, when adequately controlling for law enforce-
ment, the priority municipalities policy has no signiﬁcant impact on deforestation. The only speciﬁcation
in which there is still a signiﬁcant policy effect is the one that uses non-normalized deforestation variable –
as we mentioned before, this variable is not reliable, due to large municipality size heterogeneity.

Taken together, these results suggest that the impact of the priority municipalities policy stems from
increased monitoring and improved law enforcement in these municipalities. All other potential conse-
quences of being classiﬁed as a priority municipalities, including political and economic sanctions, appear
to have had no signiﬁcant effect on Amazon deforestation.

6. Final Remarks

Overall, our results show that changing the unit of analysis in Amazon monitoring and law enforcement
from the household to the municipality level appears to have an important negative impact on deforestation.
Moreover, our ﬁndings suggest that the driving force behind this effect is not related to political or economic
sanctions applied in targeted municipalities, but rather to improved monitoring and better targeting of law
enforcement activities in the Amazon.

This is important because is saying that change the way of monitoring and law enforcement activity
from a less centralized to a more centralized and target way produces good results. Also, as the monitoring
is targeted, the cost is also smaller, you don’t need concentrate resources in areas with few deforestation.
But, at the same time, is also true that is not possible to use this policy as a stamp policy. Deforestation
will probably not decrease because the municipality is in the "black list", if the intensity of monitoring does
not increase, as the reputation effect does not hold (priority municipality is not signiﬁcant when we control
for the number of ﬁnes). That means, the increase in the monitoring seems to be the essential part of the
priority municipalities policy.
