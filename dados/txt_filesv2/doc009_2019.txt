This paper offers a quantitative study measuring the historical relations between economics and the other 
social sciences, namely, anthropology, political science, psychology, and sociology. It performs a citation 
analysis in order to understand both whether economics has opened more space for the other social sciences 
and, if so, the subtleties of this process. Our time span is 1959-2018. This paper also develops an original 
asymmetry  measure—the  Coefficient  of  Interdisciplinary  Asymmetry.  Our  results  provide  four  major 
insights. First, we may separate the disciplines in three groups. Political science and sociology as disciplines 
with  growing  high  interdisciplinarity,  economics  and  psychology  as  disciplines  with  growing  low 
interdisciplinarity, and anthropology as the only discipline with decreasing interdisciplinarity. Second, from 
the  1960s  to  the  2010s,  economics  rose  from  the  fifth  to  the  third  position  in  terms  of  interdisciplinary 
citations  to  its  fellow  social  sciences  (outperforming  psychology  and  anthropology).  Third,  economics 
became the central social science from the 1980s onwards, answering for nearly half of the interdisciplinary 
citations within the social sciences network. Finally, the Coefficient of Interdisciplinary Asymmetry yields 
the recognition that, within the social sciences network, economics is more representative to its neighboring 
disciplines than these disciplines to economics.

Resumo 

Esse artigo oferece um estudo quantitativo mensurando as relações históricas entre a economia e as demais 
ciências sociais, quais sejam, antropologia, ciência política, psicologia e sociologia. É realizada uma análise 
de citação visando entender se a economia passou a dar mais atenção para as outras ciências sociais e, nesse 
caso, as sutilezas desse processo. Nosso período de análise é 1959-2018. Esse artigo também desenvolve 
uma  medida  original  de  assimetria—o  Coeficiente  de  Assimetria  Interdisciplinar.  Nossos  resultados 
fornecem quatro conclusões principais. Primeiro, podemos separar as disciplinas em três grupos. Ciência 
política e sociologia como disciplinas de alta e crescente interdisciplinaridade, economia e psicologia como 
disciplinas  de  baixa  e  crescente  interdisciplinaridade,  e  antropologia  como  a  única  disciplina  de 
interdisciplinaridade decrescente. Segundo, entre os anos 1960 e os anos 2010, a economia ascendeu da 
quinta para a terceira posição em termos de citações interdisciplinares às disciplinas próximas (superando 
a psicologia e a antropologia). Terceiro, a economia tornou-se a disciplina social central a partir dos anos 
1980, respondendo por aproximadamente metade das citações interdisciplinares dentro da rede de ciências 
sociais. Finalmente, o Coeficiente de Assimetria Interdisciplinar mostra que, dentro da rede das ciências 
sociais, a economia é mais representativa para suas disciplinas correlatas do que o são essas disciplinas para 
a economia.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

 

 
Nearly  a  decade  ago,  commenting  about  the  history  of  economics  and  the  history  of  the  social 
sciences,  Backhouse  and  Fontaine  (2010,  p.  3)  stated  that:  “[w]hatever  the  period  being  considered, 
references  to  the  relationships  between  economics  and  other  social  sciences  are  almost  universally 
incidental in general histories of economics.” Even within the specialized publications in the field of the 
history of economics, the literature dealing with the history of economics and the other social sciences is 
scarce.  To  illustrate  this  scarcity,  the  authors  list  the  few  papers  they  found  on  the  subject—published 
between 2000 and 2010 (BACKHOUSE & FONTAINE, 2010, p. 3-6). Listing papers published since 2010, 
we think we could add only a few more on the subject, such as Rol (2012), Engerman (2015), Fontaine 
(2015), Cavalieri (2017), and Bögenhold (2018). Such scarcity of works on the subject indicates that the 
landscape in the history of economics is still one of relative neglect to the relationship between economics 
and the other social sciences. In an attempt to contribute to this literature, this essay focuses on the evolution 
of the interdisciplinarity between economics and the social sciences. 

The  research  presented  here  is  a  descriptive-quantitative  analysis  of  the  patterns  of  interaction 
among economics and the other social sciences since 1959.1 Recently, a few studies quantitatively analyzed 
the interdisciplinary relations among the social sciences.2 In these accounts, knowledge exchange appears 
as asymmetric and economics is  taken to be more insular than its neighboring disciplines. For example, 
Fourcade,  Ollion,  and  Algan  (2015,  p.  94),  evaluating  the  insularity—understood  as  the  absence  of 
interdisciplinarity—of economics for the 2000s, identify economics as the least interdisciplinary discipline 
in  relation  to  other  social  sciences.  Notwithstanding,  there  are  contemporary  discussions  on  the  topic 
indicating that economics has become more mindful of and tolerant with the other social sciences in the 
recent  years;  therefore,  increasing  the  interdisciplinary  interactions  (BÖGENHOLD,  2018,  p.  1126; 
FONTAINE, 2015, p. 3; MÄKI, 2017). These discussions find support in a very recent research by Angrist 
et al.’s (2017, p. 2, 23-24), which presents economics with a growing tendency towards interdisciplinarity 
interaction with other social sciences. 

Hence,  the  specific  objective  of  this  essay  is  to  extend  the  empirical  literature  on  the 
interdisciplinarity of economics in relation to its fellow social sciences. More specifically, this essay aims 
at performing a citation analysis in order to understand both whether or not economics has actually opened 
more space for the other social sciences and the subtleties of this process. We want to understand how the 
patterns  of  interdisciplinary  citations  between  economics  and  the  other  social  sciences  evolved  through 
time. However, since our time span is relatively large—encompassing the years between 1959 and 2018—
we do not deal with particular events within the history of contemporary economics. We present general 
trends and general remarks about them. 

Our  study  is  close  to  the  one  performed  by  Angrist  et  al.  (2017).  We  offer,  however,  a  more 
comprehensive and focused discussion of the knowledge exchange between economics and the other social 
sciences. Our research is more comprehensive because it offers information on a wider and deeper range 
of relations, and more concentrated insofar as the discussion here is focused solely on the relations between 
economics and the other social sciences. We also developed an asymmetry measure that may allow both a 
more  thorough  perception  about  the  relative  relevance  of  economics  before  each  social  science  and  an 
evaluation  of changes in the interdisciplinary structure of the social sciences in  terms  of reciprocal  ties. 
Furthermore,  the  accomplishment  of  this  objective  may  also  serve  the  purpose  of  bringing  quantitative 
remarks on the interdisciplinarity between economics and the neighboring social disciplines to the attention 
of the history of economics profession. None of the studies whose aim is this treatment were published in 
journals  specialized  in  the  area.  Backhouse  and  Fontaine  (2010,  p.  6)  defend  that  we  should  perhaps 

                                                 
1 Quantitative approaches have not yet become routine among historians and methodologists of economics. However, Edwards, 
Giraud, and Schinckus (2018, p. 283-284) identify an ongoing methodological moment on behalf of quantitative analyses in the 
history of economics. 
2 There is a vast literature on the differences between inter-, trans-, multi-, and cross-disciplinarity. We do not intend to discuss 
taxonomies.  For  a  more  comprehensive  discussion  on  the  particularities  of  each,  see  Piaget  (1972)  and  Klein  (2010).  In  the 
remainder of this essay, interdisciplinarity will be adopted to represent knowledge flow among separate disciplines.

consider history of economics as history of social science. If this is the case, it may perhaps also be time 
for the historian of economic thought to complement his understanding of economics as a social science 
with maps of the historical relations between the social disciplines from a quantitative vantage point. 

This  essay  is  organized  in  four  sections  beyond  this  introduction.  Section  2  details  the  hitherto 
existing  empirical  studies  on  the  interdisciplinarity  among  the  social  sciences,  explains  our  empirical 
strategy,  and  introduces  the  Coefficient  of  Interdisciplinary  Asymmetry.  Section  3  presents  our  results. 
Section 4 discusses the results presented in section 3. Closing, we present some final comments. 

 

2.  METHODOLOGY:  CITATION  ANALYSIS,  EMPIRICAL  STRATEGY,  AND  THE 

COEFFICIENT OF INTERDISCIPLINARY ASYMMETRY 

 
This section counts with three subsections. The first subsection explains in what consists citation 
analysis and describes the four papers that, to our knowledge, measure social science interdisciplinarity. 
These papers are Rigney and Barnes (1980), Pieters and Baumgartner (2002), Fourcade, Ollion, and Algan 
(2015), and Angrist et al. (2017). The second subsection presents our empirical strategy. This presentation 
encompasses data, time span, and methodology. Finally, the third subsection lays out the estimation of the 
Coefficient of Interdisciplinary Asymmetry. 

 

2.1. CITATION ANALYSIS 

 
A  reference  to  an  academic  manuscript  indicates  that  the  referenced  work  is  a  relevant  piece  of 
knowledge worth bringing to the attention of the academic community. Citation analysis, accordingly, is a 
quantitative technique that answers for a bibliometric effort to understand how communication flows within 
a given scholarly network. Its aim is to describe the structure of the flow of ideas and understand the position 
journals,  disciplines, and scholars  occupy within the network (EDWARDS,  GIRAUD & SCHINCKUS, 
2018,  p.  287;  JOVANOVIC,  2018,  p.  302;  MOODY  &  LIGHT,  2006,  p.  69-70;  PIETERS  & 
BAUMGARTNER, 2002, p. 483-484). In this sense, we may understand the social sciences as a specific 
social  network  of  scholars,  journals  and  academic  departments,  among  which  we  are  interested  in  the 
journal  citation  network.  The  disciplines  commonly  regarded  as  constituents  of  the  social  sciences  are 
anthropology,  economics,  political  science,  psychology,  and  sociology  (ABBOTT,  2001,  p.  123; 
ANGRIST et al., 2017, p. 2; PIETERS & BAUMGARTNER, 2002, p. 485; RIGNEY & BARNES, 1980, 
p. 114-115). Studies that aim at understanding the structure of interdisciplinary journal citations within this 
network are scarce, however. To our knowledge, only four works on the subject have been published thus 
far—two in the last four years. 

Rigney  and  Barnes’s  (1980)  study  consists  of  a  comprehensive  citation  analysis  to  examine  the 
interdisciplinary  citations  both  (a)  within  the  social  sciences  network,  and  (b)  between  each  individual 
social science and the entirety of the academic disciplines. The authors randomly sampled five percent of 
the citations from the flagship journal3 of each social discipline and evaluated their publication sources. 
They also divided their time span in two comparable periods: 1936-1959 and 1960-1975. Their conclusion 
regarding  economics  is  that,  along  psychology,  the  discipline  had  the  lowest  rates  of  interdisciplinary 
borrowing,  the  highest  levels  of  intradisciplinary  citations—citations  to  journals  from  within  the 
discipline—, and did not receive many citations from its fellow social sciences as well. 

Pieters and Baumgartner (2002) analyzed the communication flows, for the period 1995-1997, both 
(a)  between  economics  journals,  and  (b)  between  economics  journals  and  the  other  social  sciences  and 
business. They worked with forty two economics journals and divided them into seven clusters, organized 
by citation proximity. Economics once again portrayed high levels of intradisciplinarity, with a so-called 
asymmetric pattern of citation exchange between itself and the other social sciences. 

Fourcade,  Ollion,  and  Algan  (2015)  explored  the  relationship  between  economics  and  the  other 
social  sciences  in  different  measures,  among  which  we  highlight  insularity.  The  authors  took  in

discipline.

consideration the period 2000-2009 and the analysis was made vis-à-vis sociology and political science. 
The citing source adopted, as in Rigney and Barnes (1980), was the flagship journal for each discipline and 
the reference sources were those in the 2000-2009 top 25 journals for each discipline. Their conclusion was 
that economics is  more insular than the other social sciences  and that  economics has more space in the 
neighboring disciplines than the contrary. 

Angrist  et  al.  (2017),  finally,  evaluate  the  impacts  of  extramural—a  term  the  authors  used  as  a 
substitute to what is conventionally termed interdisciplinary—citations among the social sciences and many 
other fields of knowledge, ranging their analysis from 1970 to 2015. Their analysis is a more comprehensive 
study in terms of fields. The authors show that economics is among the most insular social sciences, but 
that this situation was ameliorated in the past few years. Their unit of analysis is also a flagship journal—
which they call trunk journals—for each science. 

As  such,  then,  the  hitherto  existing  studies  commonly  regard  economics  as  a  discipline  that 
relatively neglects its sister social sciences. To this extent, Angrist et al. (2017) differs from the other works 
insofar as it places the interdisciplinarity of economics in a state of progressive improvement. The most 
comprehensive discussion of Angrist et al.’s (2017) paper, however, regards the fields of economics that 
have  become  more  important  outside  the  discipline,  not  the  general  phenomena  per  se.  Finally,  this 
literature—once again with the exception of Angrist et al. (2017), which does not make any reference to 
asymmetry  patterns—employs  the  concept  of  asymmetry  rather  loosely,  which,  as  we  will  see,  may 
jeopardize an accurate comprehension of the asymmetry patterns. 

 

2.2. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY AND METHODOLOGY 

 
Our  empirical  strategy  is,  to  some  extent,  a  hybrid  effort.  It  combines  features  of  Angrist  et  al. 
(2017),  Fourcade,  Ollion,  and  Algan  (2015),  Pieters  and  Baumgartner  (2002),  and  Rigney  and  Barnes 
(1980), with some new  elements.  It  is, above  all, a historical  evaluation of economics’  recent  past. The 
bibliographic  methods  employed  here  solely  serve  the  purpose  of  telling  the  history  of  developments 
circumscribed to our time span. 

Following Angrist et al. (2017), Fourcade, Ollion, and Algan (2015), and Rigney and Barnes (1980), 
we will concentrate our analysis on one publication per discipline. This publication is the flagship journal 
of the main American learned society for each social science. We find in the literature four reasons to see 
this  selection  of  journals  as  sufficient  for  our  analysis.  First,  we  take  the  flagship  journal  of  the  main 
American  learned  society  for  each  discipline  to  fairly  represent  the  central  currents  of  research  in  their 
respective fields (RIGNEY & BARNES, 1980, p. 115). Second, knowledge production is a socially and 
institutionally embedded act, and the learned societies play a crucial role in this process, creating stimuli 
and  development  conditions,  sponsoring  research  agendas,  and  coordinating  research  activities 
(ALMEIDA, ANGELI & PONTES, 2017, p. 81; COATS, 1985, p. 1725). Third, the choice for the learned 
societies’  journals  reduces  the  probability  of  publication  biases  nurtured  by  the  selection  of  journals 
maintained  by  single  departments  whose  publication  screening  processes  might  follow,  as  argued  by 
Colussi (2018, p. 47-48) and Heckman and Moktan (2018, p. 5-6), particular internal logics.4 And, at last, 
the American academy is still the one that holds the highest-ranked journals  and faculty departments  in 
economics (COUPÉ, 2003, p. 1337; HECK & ZALESKI, 2006, p. 1; KALAITZIDAKIS, MAMUNEAS 
& STENGOS, 2003, p. 1356-1357; KELLY & BRUESTLE, 2011, p. 660). Therefore, the journals taken 
to be the unit of analysis are: American Anthropologist (AA), American Political Science Review (APSR), 
American Sociological Review (ASR), Psychological Review (PR), and  The American Economic Review 
(AER). 

Within  these  flagship  journals,  we  collect  the  bibliographic  references  at  each  original  article  to 
build our database. Then, we search for references to the top 25 journals of each social science—detailed 
below. As follows, our investigation seeks patterns of interdisciplinary journal citations flowing from the 
                                                 
4 Heckman and Moktan (2018, p. 53) argue that the tastes of editors and the biases of journals influence the publication screening 
process. This may create clientele effects and professional incest, raising the entry costs for new ideas and researchers outside 
the orbits of the journals and their editors. Colussi (2018, p. 49) endorses the view of editor favoritism towards the members of 
the editor’s network at the expense of unconnected scholars.

flagship journals to this group of representative publications. It does not consider sources outside the top 
25 journals of each discipline. As Fourcade, Ollion, and Algan (2015) did, we perform our analysis using 
the statistical programming framework R, and most of our main functionalities pertain to the bibliometrix 
package (ARIA & CUCCURULLO, 2017). The citation database is compiled from the Elsevier Scopus and 
Web of Science (henceforth WoS) databases, which we managed to merge.5 

Our time span ranges from 1959 to 2018, which is different from the periods Rigney and Barnes 
(1980) and Angrist et al. (2017) analyzed. We chose the year 1959 as starting point because it marks the 
first record of the word interdisciplinarity and its variations in economics, according to Scopus and WoS.6 
To  analyze  how  economics’  interdisciplinarity  with  the  other  social  sciences  evolved  through  time,  we 
separated our time span in decades, from the 1960s (which includes 1959) to the 2010s (ending in 2018) 
and built a dynamic Top 25 Journal Ranking (henceforth T25) for each discipline. We qualify this T25 as 
dynamic because we constructed one ranking for each decade, with the objective of grasping each journal’s 
influence in that specific time period.  Moreover, we built our rankings based exclusively on the inCites 
Journal Citation Reports7 (henceforth JCR)—maintained by Clarivate Analytics, the same corporation that 
holds WoS—, which orders journals in  decreasing order of impact  factor. There are,  furthermore,  three 
issues involving the construction of these dynamic rankings. 

First, the dynamic rankings per decade are the arithmetic means of the year-by-year impact factors 
within each interval. We rely on the arithmetic mean of the simple journal impact factor because the 5-year 
impact factor was made available only from 2007 onwards. Second, the Social Science Citation Index JCR 
is only available from 1979 onwards—unlike the Science Citation Index JCR, which dates back to 1975 
(GARFIELD, 2007, p. 65; NISONGER, 2000, p. 264; RICE, BORGMAN & REEVES, 1988, p. 258). This 
means that social sciences journal rankings as we know them do not have observations for the period 1959-
1978. For this reason, we adopted the same retrospective ranking for the 1960s and the 1970s. The reference 
for this ranking is the triennium 1979-1981. We did not base this ranking on years farther away from 1979 
in order to avoid biases caused by mid-1980s outlier observations. There is, moreover, a difference between 
the rankings for the 1960s and the 1970s related to journal coverage: journals that did not exist in the 1960s 
were kept solely for the 1970s ranking and replaced by the next highest-ranked journal covering the 1960s. 
Finally,  in  cases  where  we  had  a  coincidence  of  journals  for  two  different  sciences,  we  eliminated  that 
journal from the discipline in which it occupied a lower average position.8 Accordingly, these journals were 
also replaced by the next highest-ranked publication. 

 

2.3. THE COEFFICIENT OF INTERDISCIPLINARY ASYMMETRY 
 

Asymmetry in interdisciplinary citations is loosely defined in Fourcade, Ollion, and Algan (2015, 
p. 93), Pieters and Baumgartner (2002, p. 498), and Rigney and Barnes (1980, p. 119). These works loosely 
use this concept  to  represent  an absolute mismatch between two disciplines’ reciprocal  interdisciplinary 
citations. Rigney and Barnes (1980, p. 114), for example, understand asymmetry as the situation in which 
“one field cites another more often that it is cited in return.” Pieters and Baumgartner (2002, p. 498, 503), 
on  the  other  hand,  thinking  of  asymmetry  as  “reciprocal  citation  relationships,”  present  asymmetry  in 
relation to the overall interdisciplinary citations of a discipline, but do not advance on this analysis. 

                                                 
5 All the accesses to Scopus and WoS were performed in September 21st, 2018. Therefore, only the first three quarters of 2018 
are covered in our sample. 
6 JSTOR delivers results that predate 1959, starting in 1940, but JSTOR does not allow us to disaggregate citation data as Scopus 
and WoS do. We will, for that reason, remain faithful to the results delivered by Scopus and WoS. 
7 Available at http://jcr.incites.thomsonreuters.com.  
8  Four  journals  were  replaced  in  economics:  Scottish  Journal  of  Political  Economy  (1960s.  remained  in  political  science), 
Problems  of  Communism  (1960s,  1970s,  1980s;  remained  in  political  science),  Journal  of  Human  Resources  (1970s, 1980s; 
remained in sociology), and Economy and Society (2000s; remained in sociology). Four journals were also replaced in sociology: 
Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology (1960s, 1970s; remained in anthropology),  Journal of Politics and Military 
Sociology (1970s; remained in political science), Social Networks (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s; remained in anthropology), and 
Politics  & Society (1990s, 2000s; remained in political science). One journal  was replaced in anthropology:  Human Ecology 
(2000s,  2010s;  remained  in  sociology).  Finally,  one  journal  was  also  replaced  in  political  science:  Socio-Economic  Review 
(2010s; remained in sociology). 

 
Following  this,  in  order  to  better  understand  the  asymmetry  patterns  in  social  science 
interdisciplinarity,  we  designed  something  we  called  Coefficient  of  Interdisciplinary  Asymmetry 
(henceforth  CIA).  The  CIA  is  supposed  to  measure  the  relation  between  two  disciplines  in  terms  of 
reciprocal proportion of citations; it quantifies the importance of discipline A to discipline B in relation to 

6 

𝜃𝐴
𝐵). This 
) (
discipline B’s importance to discipline A. Its formula for a given point in time is 𝐶𝐼𝐴𝐴,𝐵 = (
𝜎𝐴
𝐴 gives the 
equation measures the asymmetry of discipline A in relation to discipline B. In this formula, 𝜎𝐵
𝐵  gives  the  number  of  citations  to  discipline  B  in 
number  of  citations  to  discipline  A  in  discipline  B,  𝜎𝐴
discipline  A,  and  𝜃𝐴  and  𝜃𝐵  yield  the  total  number  of  interdisciplinary  citations  in  disciplines  A  and  B, 
respectively.  Therefore,  it  is  a  relation  between  the  proportion  occupied  by  disciplines  A  and  B  in  the 
interdisciplinary  citation  network  of  each  other.  Once  this  is  calculated,  𝐶𝐼𝐴𝐵,𝐴  is  given  merely  by  the 
multiplicative inverse of 𝐶𝐼𝐴𝐴,𝐵: 𝐶𝐼𝐴𝐵,𝐴 =

.

𝐴
𝜎𝐵
𝜃𝐵

𝐶𝐼𝐴𝐴,𝐵

If  𝐶𝐼𝐴𝐴,𝐵  equals  one,  we  have  that  A  plays  a  role  in  B’s  network  of  interdisciplinary  citations 
equivalent to the role played by B in A’s. For example, if, among the interdisciplinary citations of A, B is 
the target of ten per cent of A’s citations, a 𝐶𝐼𝐴 equal to one tells us that A receives the same proportion of 
B’s interdisciplinary references. As such, values closer to one represent higher symmetry than those farther 
away. Alternatively, a 𝐶𝐼𝐴𝐴,𝐵 greater than one means that A is more representative to B than B to A, while 
a  𝐶𝐼𝐴𝐴,𝐵  less  than  one  yields  the  opposite  result.  This  relation  can  only  be  established  between  two 
disciplines at a time. 

We believe the CIA to be more elucidating than the loose comparison between the absolute levels 
of interdisciplinary citations among disciplines because the latter does not take into account that disciplines 
present  different  institutional  and  historical  patterns  of  interdisciplinarity.  Since  this  difference  exists, 
analyses  of  this  sort  almost  inevitably  present  asymmetry  towards  the  less  interdisciplinary  discipline, 
inasmuch  as  its  propensity  to  cite  the  neighboring  sciences  is  smaller.  The  CIA,  au  contraire,  takes  the 
different degrees of interdisciplinarity among disciplines as given. In this sense, each discipline’s weight 
in relation to each other is measured exclusively within the interdisciplinary citations to the network. It is 
our claim, therefore, that the CIA allows us to effectively understand asymmetry patterns in terms of the 
relative relevance among two sciences of a given network. 

 

3.  RESULTS:  THE  EVOLUTION  OF  INTERDISCIPLINARITY  WITHIN  THE  SOCIAL 

SCIENCES NETWORK 

 

 
This  section  aims  at  presenting  economics’  degree  of  interdisciplinarity  in  relation  to  the  social 
sciences and its patterns of intertemporal evolution. The main results to be detailed are: (a) the evolution of 
each  discipline’s  openness  to  the  other  social  sciences’  T25;  (b)  the  evolution  of  the  citations  in 
anthropology, political science, psychology, and sociology to the economics’ T25 journals per decade; (c) 
the aggregated relations between the flagship journals and a group of core journals for each science; (d) the 
patterns of asymmetry in interdisciplinary citations; and (e) the evolution of each discipline’s references to 
the their own T25. Among these, (a) and (b) yield results that resemble the overall patterns presented by 
Angrist et al. (2017). Point (e) is close to Fourcade, Ollion, and Algan’s (2015, p. 94) perception concerning 
economics’  regard  to  the  top  of  its  internal  hierarchy.  Despite  the  prior  discussions  on  these  points,  we 
believe our analyses offer new inputs and insights on the nature of these developments in terms of length 
and focus of our study.  Evaluations (c)  and (d),  nonetheless,  offer, to  our knowledge,  completely  novel 
assessments  to  the  structure  of  the  interdisciplinary  citations  within  the  social  sciences  network.  In  this 
sense, figures 1 to 6 serve illustrate the evolution of each discipline’s degree of interdisciplinarity in relation 
to the social sciences.

Figures 1 to 5 treat how the individual T25s were cited in particular flagship journals. In these, each 
line represent the citations to one single alien discipline. Accordingly, figure 1 establishes the evolution of 
AA’s citations to the T25 journals of each discipline, with the exception of anthropology; figure 2 evaluates 
the progress of APSR’s citations to the highest-ranked journals of each discipline, with the exception of 
political  science;  and  so  forth.  Angrist  et  al.  (2017,  p.  24)  present  similar  figures,  whose  identified 
tendencies figures 1 to 5 corroborate. 

Figure 6, on the other hand, aggregates each discipline’s overall openness to the social sciences. Its 
lines represent how each individual flagship journal evolved in its citations to the aggregated T25 of the 
other social sciences. Once again, citations to a discipline’s own T25 were not taken into consideration. 
This figure also finds a similar representation in Angrist et al. (2017, p. 23). 

Collectively, these figures offer two straightforward and elucidating perceptions. The first is that 
the overall openness of the social sciences to their sister disciplines has risen in the last sixty years, from 
2.05%, in the 1960s, to 2.74%, in the 2010s—the peak throughout the six decades. This represents a growth 
of 33.74% in the average interdisciplinary within the social sciences network (with an average growth rate 
of 5.99% per decade). The second perception is that we may divide the social sciences in three classes of 
disciplines by interdisciplinarity status. The class of growing high interdisciplinarity, which kept its degree 
of  interdisciplinarity  growing  and  above  the  average  overall  interdisciplinary  openness  throughout  the 
entire series. The class of growing low interdisciplinarity, whose interdisciplinarity levels grew along our 
time span but remained below the interdisciplinary average of the social sciences. And a class of decreasing 
interdisciplinarity, which presented its interdisciplinarity levels above the average line and had it shrunk to 
levels below it from certain decade onwards. The first class is composed by political science and sociology; 
the second class is made up by economics and psychology; the third class is concentrated on anthropology. 
These same three groups could be inferred from Angrist et al. (2017, p. 23)—even though the authors do 
not do it. 

Political science and sociology answer for the highest degrees of interdisciplinarity. Their levels of 
interdisciplinarity  are  so  relatively  high,  that  their  lowest  decennial  percentages  (3.47%  and  2.88%, 
respectively), never  found themselves  surpassed  by the highest  decennial percentages of the other three 
disciplines. In fact, if it were not for these two disciplines—i.e., if we eliminated them from our narrative—
, the aggregated average of interdisciplinary openness of the social sciences would have decreased in the 
sixty years analyzed (from 1.22% in the 1960s to 1.12% in the 2010s). Additionally, in the 2010s, political 
science and sociology combined answered for more than three-quarters (75.46%) of the interdisciplinary 
citations within the network. 

Economics and psychology show low but  intertemporally  growing degrees of interdisciplinarity. 
Economics departs from 0.37% in the 1960s to reach 1.42% in the 2010s, while psychology departs from 
0.55% and finishes with 1.06%. Economics departs from a lower degree of interdisciplinary openness and 
evolves prominently in relation to its first observation, nearly quadrupling it, while psychology’s decennial 
percentages  nearly  double.  Still,  both  economics  and  psychology  remain  below  the  average  of 
interdisciplinary  openness  through  all  the  decades  (economics  would  find  itself  above  the  decennial 
averages from the 1980s onwards if political science and sociology were set aside in the calculation, as 
suggested above; psychology, however, would all the same remain below the new average throughout the 
entire account). 

Anthropology, at last, is the only discipline whose degree of interdisciplinary openness decreased 
throughout  our  period  of  analysis.  In  the  1960s,  anthropology  found  itself  above  the  average  of 
interdisciplinary openness, with 2.74% of its citations directed to its fellow social sciences. From the 1970s 
onwards, however, anthropology became progressively less prone to cite these disciplines, until it reached 
0.88% in the 2010s, its lowest degree of social science interdisciplinarity in our sample. 

On these grounds, table 1 compares the sampled  points of departure and arrival of each science. 
Political science, sociology, and psychology did not have their positions altered between the 1960s and the 
2010s, remaining in the first, second, and fourth positions, respectively. Economics, however, rose from 
the fifth to the third place, overriding psychology and anthropology. Anthropology, given its progressively 
decreasing regard for the social sciences, descended from the third to the fifth position—in Angrist et al.’s 
(2017, p. 23) remark, anthropology also presents decreasing levels of social science interdisciplinarity, but 

 

it manages to remain above the levels of economics and psychology in terms of interdisciplinary citations, 
from 1970 to 2015.

The  first  four  columns,  regarding  the  starting  and  final  stages  of  interdisciplinary  openness,  are 
important to situate economics in relation to its fellow social sciences. Economics, accordingly, is much 
below political science and sociology in terms of interdisciplinarity citations to the other social sciences. 
This was true in the 1960s and it remains true in the 2010s. Economics, however, managed to improve its 
situation and to become more mindful of the social sciences than psychology and anthropology.9 In the case 
of the latter, this is partially to blame on anthropology’s contraction of its own interdisciplinarity levels. 
The escalation of economics’ degree of interdisciplinarity vis-à-vis those of psychology, political science, 
and sociology, however, surpassing the first and reducing the gap with respect to the remaining two, is to 
be accredited exclusively to economics itself. 

Among all the five disciplines, economics is the one that became more open in relation to its self-
former levels. This is what the last two columns of table 1 show. As already presented, anthropology is the 
only  discipline  whose  degree  of  interdisciplinary  openness  decreased.  It  had  a  growth  rate  of  -68.07%. 
Among  those  whose  interdisciplinary  citations  increased,  psychology  nearly  doubled,  growing  95.33%, 
while sociology and political science also grew significantly, having 77.31% and 41.32%, respectively, as 
growth rates. It must be noted that the latter two disciplines already departed from relatively high degrees 
of interdisciplinarity, which makes these numbers even more expressive. Economics, finally, even though 
it might be argued that its point of departure was ridiculously low, grew 279.65%. This means that, in the 
2010s, within the universe of AER citations, articles originally published in the highly ranked journals of 
the alien social sciences occupied a space nearly four times bigger than they did in the 1960s. When we 
compare economics in the 2010s with economics in the 1960s, therefore, we do not have any option but to 
conclude that our study do not find enough substance to reject the hypothesis defended by Fontaine (2015, 
p. 3) and Mäki (2017) and measured by Angrist et al. (2017, p. 23-24): the attention of economics to the 
other social sciences—as long as the AER as a proxy is concerned—has indeed become more prominent. 

This is however, a two-way street: if the attention of economics to its sister social disciplines has 
risen, the attention of the alien social sciences to economics has risen in return—and much more incisively. 
Table 2 compares these rates of growth. The overall openness of the social sciences went up 33.74%, with 
an average growth rate of 5.99% per decade, as aforementioned. Meanwhile, the citations of economics to 
the  T25s  of  anthropology,  political  science,  psychology,  and  sociology  augmented  279.65%,  with  an 
average growth rate of 30.58%. At the same time, the average of citations to economics by the other social 
sciences grew 333.52%, with an average growth rate of 34.09% per decade. 

 
 

                                                 
9 Interestingly, a measure of average journal turnover regarding each social science’s T25 ranks the disciplines exactly as in the 
2010s ranking in terms of  interdisciplinarity. The journal turnover  measures  how  much  a discipline’s T25 in a given  decade 
differs from that discipline’s immediately preceding T25. Accordingly, political science leads with the highest average turnover 
(36.67%), followed by sociology (30.67%), economics (28.67%), psychology (27.33%), and anthropology (22.67%).

This intertemporal evaluation further indicates that economics rose to the highest rank among the 
social sciences in terms of prestige in the 1980s, after an increase of 106.42% in citations directed to its 
T25. From this decade onwards, as displayed in figures 1 to 4, economics became the most cited discipline 
in  political  science,  psychology  (both  of  which  had  had  sociology  as  most  cited  discipline  in  1960s-
1970s),10 and sociology (in psychology’s stead)—the exception here is anthropology, in which sociology 
remained the most cited discipline from the 1960s to the 2010s. 

This  movement  of economics towards the center of the social sciences  network may be  inferred 
from  table  3  and  figure  7.  Table  3  contains  information  regarding  the  proportions  of  interdisciplinary 
(abbreviated as ID in the table) citations to and from economics. The first three columns tell us that, among 
all  the  interdisciplinary  citations  to  social  sciences  (abbreviated  as  SS  in  the  table)—accounted  by  the 
simple addition of the absolute number of interdisciplinary citations—, the AER evolved from representing 
merely  2.19%  in  the  1960s  to  representing  19.23%  in  the  2010s—nearly  one-fifth,  among  the  five 
disciplines. The final three columns, alternatively, illustrate that economics, which represented 15.90% of 
all the anthropology, political science, psychology, and sociology interdisciplinary citations to neighboring 
social sciences in the 1960s, accounted for 56.01% of these citations in the 2010s. Naturally, the absolute 
number  accounted  here  disregards  the  AER  citations,  because  we  are  looking  for  interdisciplinary 
references, and AER citations to economics would constitute a case of intra-, instead of interdisciplinary 
interaction. Accordingly, these columns inform the reader that economics, from the 1990s onwards, became 
the  target  of  more  than  half  of  the  absolute  number  of  interdisciplinary  citations  to  the  social  sciences 
employed by anthropology, political science, psychology, and sociology. Still, if we had not disregarded 
the AER interdisciplinary citations, economics would significantly represent 45.24% of the interdisciplinary 
citations in our network—naturally, AER citations to economics were not taken into account. 

Figure  7,  on  the  other  hand,  shows  that  this  rise  in  attention  towards  economics  was  more 
conspicuous in political science and in sociology, while anthropology actually contracted its utilization of 
citations to economics. 

Economics’ movement towards higher prestige before the social sciences coincides with what has 
been conventionally called “empirical turn11 in economics,” alleged to have taken place in the last decades 
of  the  twentieth  century  (BACKHOUSE  &  CHERRIER,  2017,  p.  2).  Hamermesh’s  (2013,  p.  168) 
bibliometric investigation shows that a shift towards more empirical work in economics actually took place 

                                                 
10 Psychology’s citations to economics oscillated in the following decades. In the 1990s, sociology was the most cited discipline 
in the PR, but economics reclaimed this position in the two following decades. 
11 Mäki (2017) defends that the terminology of turns is constantly used in a careless fashion, causing the term to lose its meaning. 

 

between 1983 and 1993. Angrist et al. (2017, p. 38), in addition, display a rise in the interest of the social 
sciences for economics’ empirical works. It is interesting to notice, therefore, that economics’ effective rise 
as the most prestigious social science coincides precisely with the steering of its attention towards empirical 
research.  Notwithstanding  the  importance  of  this  potential  relation  and  the  discussion  opportunities 
available regarding this particular subject, there are numerous questions and puzzles circumscribed to this 
so-called empirical turn whose disputes escape the purpose of this essay.

A  comparison  between  figures  5  and  7  yields  a  source  for  introducing  the  asymmetric  relations 
between  economics  and  the  other  social  sciences,  presented  especially  by  Fourcade,  Ollion,  and  Algan 
(2015, p. 94). The comparison between these figures allow us to pair economics with each one of the other 
four disciplines per decade. This gives us twenty four pairing observations, summarized in table 4. The first 

 

column in each box gives economics’ citations to the paired discipline, while the second column gives the 
opposite relation. The higher percentages in each comparison are in bold. In twenty two out of the twenty 
four observations, economics’ space in the paired social science is bigger than the space of the paired social 
science in economics. The only exception is psychology both in the 1990s and 2000s.

From this table, it is straightforward that economic knowledge flows into the other social sciences 
more than the contrary. In percentage terms, we find that economics began our series as more important to 
each  alien  discipline  than  each  alien  discipline  to  economics,  and  that  this  relation  remained  nearly 
untouched across time. 

In terms of growth rates, anthropology’s citations to economics is the only one to have decreased, 
at an average of 31.43% per decade—still, economics never cited anthropology more than anthropology 
cited economics in any given decade. Political science’s and sociology’s growth of citations to economics 
were much more prominent than the opposite. Psychology, alternatively, grew in significance to economics 
more  than  economics  to  psychology.  Given  that  economics’  representation  in  psychology’s  articles 
remained  higher  than  psychology’s  representation  in  economics’  articles  (exception  made  to  the 1990s-
2000s observations), one might loosely  infer that this  movement  actually  represented  a reduction of the 
asymmetry between economics and psychology, or that the asymmetry took place towards psychology in 
2000s-2010s.12 

However, this result is unweighted for interdisciplinary citations within the social sciences network. 
In order to further our understanding of the asymmetry patterns, we must resort to the CIA. Accordingly, 
figure 8 offers a visualization of how economics’ asymmetry with the neighboring social sciences evolved 
between the 1960s and the 2010s. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                 
12 Exclusively in mathematical terms, we could also say that economics’ asymmetry with anthropology was reduced between the 
1960s and the 2010s. However, this is the case because there was no citation to anthropology in the AER during the 1960s. From 
the 1970s onwards, we find an actual decrease in economics’ citations to anthropology as well.

The information displayed in figure 8 is read as follows: the closer a point is to the dashed line in 
the center of each facet (which represents 𝐶𝐼𝐴 = 1), the more symmetric is the relation between economics 
and the indicated sister discipline. Points to the left of the line mean that economics is less representative 
for that science than otherwise—asymmetry outwards economics. Points to the right of the symmetry line, 
on the other hand, mean that economics’ weight in the interdisciplinary citations to the social sciences in 
that  specific  discipline  is  greater  than  the  opposite—asymmetry  towards  economics.  The  figure, 
accordingly, shows us that economics weighted less on the social sciences’ interdisciplinary citations in the 
1960s than the opposite, with  the exception of psychology.  In  fact,  psychology is  the only discipline in 
which asymmetry was never outwards economics. In the 1970s, economics grew in significance within the 
network, and an asymmetry towards economics surfaced in political science. In the 1980s, only sociology 
kept  a  pattern  of  asymmetry  outwards  economics.  From  the  1990s  onwards,  sociology  joined  the  other 
disciplines and all the observations now give us asymmetry towards economics. 

There  is  a  further  aspect  regarding  this  figure  that  inspires  caution.  A  difference  exists  between 
economics’ relatively symmetric relations with, for example, both sociology in the 1980s and anthropology 
in the 1970s. While the former is symmetric because sociology was as important to economics as economics 
to  political  science  in  the  1980s,  the  latter  is  symmetric  because  anthropology  was  as  unimportant  to 
economics as economics to anthropology in the 1970s. Therefore, again, we must reiterate that these plots 
represent reciprocal importance within the network, not absolute relevance of disciplines to each other. 

It also does not mean that a rise in asymmetry towards economics indicates that economics became 
more cited in that discipline in absolute terms. It means that economics rose in significance. Accordingly, 
this can also be a product of a discipline’s reduction in citations to other social sciences. This is the case, 
for example, for psychology, whose citations to political science and sociology decreased across time. We 
have seen that the number of AER citations to psychology have grown more than the number of PR citations 
to economics. Still, the asymmetry towards economics in relation to psychology was enlarged between the 
1960s and the 2010s. 

15 

 
Furthermore, an additional and elucidating investigation arises from citations to what we defined 
here as Core Journals. The results are summarized in figure 9. The core journals of a discipline are taken 
to be those that appeared in the T25 of that discipline in all the decades analyzed here, from the 1960s to 
the 2010s. All the disciplines have closely the same number of core journals, which range from four to six. 
Economics has six core journals (AER, Econometrica, Economic Geography, Journal of Political Economy, 
Quarterly  Journal  of  Economics,  and  Review  of  Economic  Studies).13  Psychology  (Advances  in 
Experimental  Social  Psychology,  Annual  Review  of  Psychology,  Psychological  Bulletin,  PR,  and 
Psychosomatic  Medicine)  and  sociology  (American  Journal  of  Sociology,  ASR,  British  Journal  of 
Sociology,  Journal  of  Marriage  and  the  Family,  and  Social  Problems)  have  five  core  journals.  Finally, 
political science (American Journal of Political Science, APSR, Journal of Conflict Resolution, and Journal 
of  Politics)  and  anthropology  (American  Anthropologist,  American  Journal  of  Physical  Anthropology, 
Current Anthropology, and Journal of Human Evolution) have four core journals.

Figure 9 does not weight the references for interdisciplinary citations to the social sciences. This is 
intended to offer, beyond the recognition of the overall interdisciplinary citations to key journals, a point 
in case regarding the disciplines’ citations to their own cores as well. From this figure, we may realize that, 
in  regard  to  unweighted  overall  citations,  economics’  core  is  the  most  representative  one  for  political 
science  (1.52%),  psychology  (0.23%),  and  sociology  (1.03%).  For  economics,  on  the  other  hand,  the 
political  science  core  is  the  most  representative  one  (0.36%).  These  results  endorse  the  weighted 
investigation, which places economics as the most relevant social science citation-wise within the network, 
and political science as the discipline to which economics directs more attention. Moreover, once again, we 
can easily identify political science and sociology ahead of anthropology, economics, and psychology in

terms of citations to its neighboring disciplines. It is worth highlighting, nonetheless, that anthropology and 
psychology are worse off than economics in terms of social science interdisciplinarity. 

Additionally, it is important to realize the significantly higher percentage of economics’ citations to 
its  own most prestigious journals. While the other  four disciplines have the citations to  their own cores 
ranging between 3.14% and 6.15%, economics’ resort to the economics core is 15.67%. This corroborates 
Fourcade, Ollion, and Algan’s (2015, p. 96) realization that economics, besides looking more inward than 
the  other  social  sciences,  also  displays  a  much  higher  reliance  on  knowledge  produced  at  the  top  of  its 
internal  hierarchy.  This  relationship  is  illustrated  in  figure  10.  This  figure  presents  each  discipline’s 
citations to its own T25 across the decades. The much higher level in which we find economics is likely to 
represent that economics has much more regard to the top of its internal hierarchy than do the other four 
disciplines.

This figure points to the fact that, in relation to the social sciences, the most prestigious economics 
journals occupy a much more central position in the network of intradisciplinary knowledge transmission. 
Accordingly, it is remarkable that, even though knowledge produced in other sources has, by definition, 
less  space  to  be  preserved  and  replicated  within  the  discipline,  economics  managed  to  become  a  more 
interdisciplinary social science in relation both to itself and to anthropology and psychology. We have a lot 
of ground to cover, if we want to become as welcoming to social science knowledge as political science 
and sociology, but we cannot deny that our situation has been improved in such matters. 

 

4.  DISCUSSION 

 
A study like this is unlikely to be free of particular limitations, beyond the general ones remarked 
by  Cherrier  and  Svorencik  (2018,  p.368,  372).  First,  even  though  citations  to  periodical  literature  are  a 
useful  market-based  measure  of  research  quality,  they  are  imperfect  measures  of  interdisciplinary 

17 

 

influences14  (HAMERMESH,  2018,  p.  125;  RIGNEY  &  BARNES,  1980,  p.  116).  The  results  here, 
therefore, ought to be interpreted cautiously. Second, we restricted our analysis to the flagship journal of 
each  social  science—and,  no  matter  how  well  justified  this  process  may  be,  it  is  perhaps  the  greatest 
particular limitation of our analysis. Third, the citation patterns analyzed comprise uniquely journal articles. 
Other sources such as books, book reviews and conference proceedings are entirely absent in our sample. 
This  might  be  debilitating,  because  book  reviews  tend  to  occupy  a  privileged  position  in  citation  index 
reports, while books and conference proceedings are very important as sources of scholarly knowledge (HU 
et al., 2018, p. 1134; PIETERS & BAUMGARTNER, 2002, p. 505). Fourth, our ranking definitions for the 
T25 articles in each social science per decade had to extrapolate impact factors listed between 1979 and 
1981 all the way back to 1960s. The implicit assumption here is that the influence of the journals remained 
unaltered from the 1960s to the early-1980s. Finally, there are many factors that influence one discipline’s 
citations to another, in addition to the influence of the cited discipline per se. Among these, Rigney and 
Barnes (1980, p. 125) highlight the observed scientific status of the cited discipline, the perceived relevance 
of the cited discipline’s subject  matter, and the amount of literature available for citation. These factors 
escape our analysis. 

Still, despite these shortcomings, the findings of this essay are compelling in two senses. First, our 
results excavate the asymmetry of knowledge transfer between economics and the social sciences found in 
the literature:  anthropology, political  science, psychology, and sociology resort more to  economics than 
economics  to  each  one  of  them.  This  pattern  was  intensified  in  the  last  sixty  years,  especially  from  the 
1980s onwards. This result is given both by the absolute number of citations and by economics’ CIA with 
each one of the sister disciplines. Second, the  results also  point that three classes of disciplines  may be 
distinguished: one of growing high interdisciplinarity (political science and sociology), one of growing low 
interdisciplinarity (economics and psychology), and one of decreasing interdisciplinarity (anthropology). 
This shows that economics has space to intensify its interdisciplinary ventures, but that it is not—as the 
prior particular impressions of this author had him believe—the most insular social science. 

Therefore, the main conclusion of this essay should be read parsimoniously in the following sense. 
If  we  rely  on  the  American  associations’  flagship  journals  as  proxies  for  entire  disciplines,  understand 
journal articles as the main sources of knowledge diffusion, and count the best-ranked journals as more 
pervasive influences, the estimates laid down in this study indicate that, between 1959 and 2018, economics 
has  become  (a)  a  more  interdisciplinary  social  science—even  though  the  openness  to  economics  in  the 
social sciences grew much more acutely than the openness to the social sciences in economics—; and (b) 
the  most  important  discipline  within  the  social  sciences  interdisciplinary  network.  Nevertheless,  the 
percentages  of  economics’  openness  to  the  social  sciences  remain  below  the  average  interdisciplinarity 
within the social sciences network all along our time span (from 0.37% vis-à-vis 2.05%, in the 1960s, to 
1.42% vis-à-vis 2.74%, in the 2010s). 

This conclusion includes the perception that economics rose from the fifth to the third position in 
terms of interdisciplinarity within the social sciences network—and this goes against the usual portrait of 
economics as the least interdisciplinary social science, as Fontaine (2015, p. 3) punctuates. Additionally, it 
is interesting to notice that this rise contradicts the survey conducted in 2006 and reproduced by Fourcade, 
Ollion, and Algan (2015, p. 95), according to which economists are the only professionals (in comparison 
with  sociologists,  historians,  political  scientists,  financists,  and  psychologists)  whose  majority  believe 
knowledge obtained by a single discipline to be better than interdisciplinary knowledge. 

Furthermore, between 1936 and 1975, Rigney and Barnes (1980, p. 122) identified that “[…] the 
only social science discipline that has cited economic literature to any important degree is political science, 
followed at a distant by sociology.” Our results show that, from 1959 to 2018, there was a change in this 
picture, especially from the 1980s onwards, when economics became the most cited discipline in political 
science, psychology,  and sociology—anthropology  here, as in  other  aspects  of our study, is  a particular 

                                                 
14 Citations and publication follow many other criteria that transcend the search for quality ideas. For a fuller comprehension of 
the subtleties behind these processes in economics, see Laband and Piette (1994), Kapeller (2010), Brogaard, Engelberg, and 
Parsons (2014), Colussi (2018), and Heckman and Moktan (2018).

case.  The  average  participation  of  economics  in  the  citations  employed  by  the  four  remaining  social 
sciences grew from 0.40% in the 1960s to 1.74% in the 2010s, which marks a growth of 333.52%. 

These  conclusions  are  in  line  with  part  of  the  literature  on  the  subject,  which  places  economics 
precisely in this progressive state of interdisciplinarity. Fontaine (2015, p. 3), for example, defends that, 
even  though  economists  misinterpret  interdisciplinarity  for  economics  imperialism,  economics  “has 
appeared more cross-disciplinary than expected” from World War II onwards. Bögenhold (2018, p. 1126), 
in  addition,  insightfully  concludes  that  pari  passu  with  the  decline  in  sociology’s  public  reputation, 
economics embraced the earlier discussions on the social dimension of economic behavior, moving toward 
the other social sciences.  

Finally, in a 2017 American Economic Association discussion panel,15 which examined publishing 
and  promotion  in  economics,  Angus  Deaton  asserted  that  economics,  in  relation  to  other  fields,  is  a 
relatively open discipline. Our data show that economics is not among the most open social sciences, but 
that Deaton is not wrong: economics is not the most insular as well. George Akerlof, alternatively, defended 
that  there  is  almost  a  total  disconnect  between  economics  and  sociology  and  that,  perhaps,  some 
combination of both would be more appropriate to deal with the type of situations economists tend to look 
at. We believe this idea to be extendable to all the social sciences analyzed in this essay. Strictly speaking, 
the data have shown that economics is indeed paying more attention to these disciplines, getting therefore 
closer to Akerlof’s ideal. As Angrist et al. (2017, p. 22) postulate in their conclusion, “[…] economists are 
also  increasingly  likely  to  read  other  social  sciences.  […]  economic  scholarship  has  never  been  more 
exciting or useful than it is today.” Evaluating the substance of economics, however, it is straightforward 
that the economics profession, if it aims at honoring Akerlof’s plea and follow the examples laid down by 
political science and sociology, still has a long way to go. 

 

5.  FINAL COMMENTS 

 
This essay represents the amalgam of two subjects dear to these authors: the study of economics as 
an interdisciplinary social science and the application of quantitative methods to further our understanding 
on the history of economics. We genuinely believe our field could benefit from both enterprises. In relation 
to the general trends Fontaine (2015), Angrist et al. (2017), Mäki (2017), and Bögenhold (2018) identified 
and our study confirmed, we see promising research opportunities. Given the wide range of our analysis, 
we were not able to scrutinize particular movements throughout the history of economic thought in terms 
of  social  science  interdisciplinarity.  We  hope,  nonetheless,  this  paper  may  instigate  some  more  focused 
analyses. If nothing else, this might help us understand the particular events that, taken together, constitute 
the overall movement presented in this study.
