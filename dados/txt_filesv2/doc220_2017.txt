smoking in Brazil

Abstract

We investigated the role of education in an individual’s decision to smoke and in the
intensity of tobacco use when he or she becomes a smoker, controlling for socioeconomic
and demographic characteristics, among other relevant variables. We present evidence
from estimations (probit model, sample selection model, count model) using a sample
composed of almost 36,000 people living in Brazil in 2008. Reinforcing ﬁndings from
the international literature, we saw that higher levels of education are associated with a
lower probability of smoking and with a lower number of cigarettes smoked daily. Other
marginal and relevant results were also found. Information about the risks of smoking
and tobacco advertising are examples of variables with high statistical signiﬁcance and
the expected sign (negative and positive, respectively). These results is in line with the
National Program of Tobacco Control.

1. Introduction

Smoking is a toxicomania characterized by physical and psychological addic-
tion to nicotine, one of the 4,720 toxic substances contained in tobacco. Research
associates smoking with at least ﬁfty types of diseases, most of which are chronic
and severe ones. It is estimated that the life expectancy of a smoking individual
is at least 10 years shorter than that of a non-smoking one.

In Brazil, tobacco use often takes the form of consumption of manufactured
cigarettes.
In 2013, there were 21.4 million smokers in Brazil, 18.5 million of
whom were daily smokers. According to the Ministry of Health, about 200,000
deaths per year are related to tobacco consumption.

In economic terms, smoking increases expenditures with health care and de-
creases productivity due to morbidity and premature death, substantially redu-
cing the stock of human capital in society (World Bank, 1999). According to
estimates of World Bank (2015), when indirect costs are also taken into account,
smoking accounts for losses estimated at US$ 1 trillion worldwide every year.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers smoking as the main cause of
preventable death in the world.

In view of the great social impact of smoking, this paper is mainly intended
to empirically investigate, based on Becker and Murphy (1988) theory of ratio-
nal addiction, the socioeconomic and demographic risk factors associated with
tobacco consumption and intensity of tobacco use, emphasizing the hypotheti-
cal eﬀect of education. What socioeconomic characteristics are associated with
the decision to smoke and with the intensity of tobacco use? Since education is
positively associated with an individual’s health status and habits (Cutler and
Lleras-Muney, 2006; Deaton and Paxson, 2004; Grossman, 2006; Lleras-Muney,
2005), is the same reasoning valid for the relationship between education and
smoking behavior?

The theory of human capital and the relationship between education and he-
alth can explain the link between education and decisions related to smoking.
Becker (1962) deﬁnes investment in human capital as one of the activities lea-
ding to a higher real income in the future for an individual. This investment
includes schooling, professional training, health care and acquisition of informa-
tion about the economic system. All investments of this kind in human beings

could improve their physical and mental skills, making it possible to predict with
greater certainty that their real income will be higher in the future. Workers
can invest in any aspect that can enhance and improve their skills (schooling
and/or training), thus improving their human capital and consequently raising
their marginal productivity and earnings in the labor market.

For Schultz (1961) much of what we consider consumption is actually invest-
ment in human capital: spending on education, health care, internal migrations
in search of better job opportunities, among other expenditures. By investing in
themselves, individuals can expand the set of choices available to them, increasing
their well-being.

Galama and van Kippersluis (2015) mention the importance of health care as
an element of human capital: longevity, provision of direct utility and time that
can be devoted to working. Theory describes the persistent association between
education and health in several ways. There is evidence that education increases
access to important information for people to consider health care when making
decisions, i.e. education paves the way for diﬀerent patterns of reasoning and
decision-making. In general, more educated people respond to new information
faster than less educated or uneducated individuals. Education also aﬀects health
through changes in behaviors and opportunities, particularly in income oppor-
tunities (World Bank, 1999; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2006; de Walque, 2010;
Feinstein, 2002; Grossman, 1972).

As education aﬀects health-related decisions, it is also likely to aﬀect decisions
related to smoking. Several studies have shown that this relation is real. Their
results suggest that education can aﬀect the decision to quit smoking and that
more education reduces smoking initiation and addiction to nicotine. Indirectly,
if education makes people more patient, it reduces their propensity to indulge in
short-term pleasures with long-term costs (de Walque, 2010; Kendler et al., 1999;
Koning et al., 2015; Sander, 1995).

In this theoretical context, we apply two hypotheses. The ﬁrst one is that
”education reduces the probability of an individual becoming a smoker ”, and the
second one is that ”education reduces the intensity of tobacco use among smo-
kers”. Therefore, we used a large random sample of Brazilians aged 15 and above
composed of almost 36,000 people from all over the country. We highlight that
microdata of this nature is rarely found even in developed countries, where data
for empirical research are more available.

This study is organized as follows. We present Becker and Murphy (1988)
theory of rational addiction and relevant empirical literature in Section 2.
In
Section 3 we show the data base, the modelling and the speciﬁcation of empirical
models and discuss our results. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2. Theoretical Background

Becker and Murphy (1988) developed a theory of rational addiction accor-
ding to which rationality implies a consistent plan to maximize utility over time.
Strong addiction requires a great eﬀect of consumption of a good in the past
on its consumption in the present. This complementarity causes some stationary
states to become unstable. According to the authors, the theory of rational choice
would explain a large number of addiction behaviors. Even the most addicted
individuals are usually rational in the sense that they make prospects of maxi-
mizing their utility based on stable preferences. Here, addiction is not seen as
restricted to alcohol, tobacco or cocaine, as it includes addiction to work, food,
religion, music and so forth. A good is considered addictive if its consumption at
diﬀerent moments in time is complementary and the greater the complementa-
rity, the greater the degree of addiction. The onset and continuity of dangerous
addictions, such as smoking and alcoholism, and of beneﬁcial addictions, such as
to religion, are often linked to stressful events experienced throughout one’s life
cycle, such as adolescence, divorce, unemployment, and so on. Even people with
the same utility function and the same income and facing the same price levels
may have diﬀerent degrees of addiction according to their diﬀerent experiences
in life.

This study will use the economic theory of cigarette addiction (Suranovic
et al., 1999) presented below as the basis for the speciﬁcation of the empirical
models and for discussing the results of the econometric estimations.

The eﬀects of smoking for a smoker at age A are broken down into three
separable addictive components: current beneﬁts (BA), future losses (LA) and
consumption adjustment costs (CA). Current beneﬁts represent utility derived
during the period in which one smokes. It is assumed that this utility (or be-
neﬁts) of smoking at age A, (BA) increases at decreasing rates as the current
consumption of cigarettes (s) increases, that is,

BA = BA(s)

BA ≥ 0, B(cid:48)

A ≥ 0, B(cid:48)(cid:48)

A < 0, ∀s ≥ 0

Current disutility of future losses caused by smoking is determined by expec-
ted losses to health. It is assumed that individuals expected to live to a certain
age, as deﬁned by their life expectancy. It is assumed that each cigarette con-
sumed reduces the life expectancy of an individual, who will then evaluate his
or her future losses by calculating the discounted present value of the expected
reduction in his or her lifetime. Therefore, current perception of future losses
tends to increase among young people and decrease among older people.

It is assumed that an individual is A years old currently and that the life
expectancy (remaining years of life) of a non-smoking individual at the age of A
is represented by T (A). It is assumed that T (cid:48)(A) < 0 and T (cid:48)(cid:48)(A) = 0. It is further

4

as T (A) − αSA, where SA = (cid:82) A

assumed that each cigarette smoked reduces life expectancy by a ﬁxed value α.
Therefore, the life expectancy of a smoker at the age of A can be represented
t=0 stdt is the cumulative total stock of previous

cigarette consumption.

The present value of the expected ﬂow of future utility for a smoker at the

age of A can be expressed as

V (A, s) =

(cid:90) T (A)+A−α(SA+s)

e−r(t−A)Wtdt

t=A

where r is the set discount rate, e−r(t−A) is the discount factor during period t
and Wt is the expected utility during period t. Bearing in mind that s represents
cigarette smoking over that period, αs at the upper limit represents the years of
life lost due to smoking during the current period and αSA represents the years
of life lost due to smoking over one’s lifetime.

The present value of future losses expected by a smoker at the age of A as a

result of smoking during this period is

LA(s) = V (A, 0) − V (A, s) =

(cid:90) T (A)+A−αSA

T (A)+A−α(SA+s)

e−r(t−A)Wtdt.

Future losses increase with smoking, as each cigarette smoked eliminates ex-
pected beneﬁts in the ﬁnal moments of one’s life. Losses grow at increasing rates
because each cigarette shortens a smoker’s life, resulting in a higher discount rate
to be applied to the ﬁnal minutes of one’s life.
The model assumes that the adjustment cost for smokers at the age of A,
CA(s), is a function of their smoking history, as deﬁned by HA = {st} ∀t ∈ [0, A]
and the current consumption, s5.

Thus,

and

CA = C(s; HA)

∀s ∈ [0, sh]

CA = 0

∀s ≥ sh.

(1)

It is assumed that any level of consumption equal to or greater than the level
of habitual consumption, sh, does not impose any cost for cutting down smoking.
Because consumption is reduced to below its usual level, this cost increases. The
highest cost could result from quitting smoking altogether immediately.
It is
assumed that C(cid:48)
A < 0, i.e. that adjustment costs decrease as s approaches the
usual level. However, there is no reason to assign a sign to C(cid:48)(cid:48)
A.

5The adjustment represents discomforts (loss of concentration, extreme irritability, etc.) cau-

sed by quitting or cutting down smoking.

5

The consumer problem can then be deﬁned. It is assumed that an individual
aged A chooses to consume currently an amount of cigarettes and an amount of a
compound good y, subject to budget constraints. The objective of the consumer
is to maximize the present value of current and expected net beneﬁts, as deﬁned
above. The compound good generates utility only during the current period and
has a utility function that is addictive and separable from the utility of cigarettes.
UA(s) = BA(s) − LA(s) − CA(s) is deﬁned. Thus, the individual’s problem is

subject to

max
s,y

WA = UA(s) + Γ(y)

pss + pyy = IA,

where Γ is the utility function of compound good y, WA is the sum of the cur-
rent utility at the of age A of the consumption of cigarettes and of the compound
good; ps and py are the prices of cigarettes and of the compound good, respec-
tively; IA is the income at the age of A. Kuhn-Tucker’s ﬁrst-order conditions
are

and

Γ(cid:48) − µpy ≥ 0

A − µps ≥ 0
U(cid:48)

where µ is the marginal utility of income. The second-order conditions for

maximum are

U(cid:48)(cid:48)
A < 0

e Γ(cid:48)(cid:48) < 0.

Suranovic et al. (1999) explain the early stages of tobacco addiction by analy-
zing the decision to start smoking, when a smoker becomes addicted to tobacco
and when an addict decides to quit smoking.

2.1. Previous Empirical Studies

The empirical literature suggests that the eﬀects of education on health occur
through three channels: (i) economic factors such as income and employment;
(ii) health-related behaviors and (iii) psychosocial factors. In this paper, we will
analyze the eﬀects on health-related behaviors. These behaviors include, among
others, the habit of smoking, which is the subject matter of this study.

The strong relationship between education and health, even controlling for
income, is considered robust in the literature on social sciences and economics

6

(Deaton and Paxson, 2004; Fuchs, 1982; Grossman, 2004; Lleras-Muney, 2005).
The decision to smoke or not is a conscious choice that has a direct bearing on an
individual’s health status and mortality. Because smoking is the leading cause
of preventable death in the world, the fact that education may play a major
role in preventing this habit suggests that traditional estimates of the returns on
education, which are often focused on results for the labor market, may perhaps
underestimate actual returns. Since education aﬀects health-related decisions, it
is also likely to aﬀect decisions related to smoking. Results show that education
can aﬀect the decision to quit smoking and that more schooling may be associated
with lower tobacco use initiation rates and lower nicotine addiction rates.

Wetter et al. (2005) observed a strong relationship between lower schooling
and greater likelihood of smoking, since less educated people tend to work in
environments in which smoking is acceptable and where there is little incentive
to quit smoking. De Walque (2007) found the result that more educated people
are less likely to smoke and, when they do smoke, they are more likely to quit.
Grimard and Parent (2007) also observed the eﬀect of education on starting to
smoke, but they found no evidence that more educated individuals are more likely
to quit smoking. For Brazil, there is some evidences that tobacco addiction is
prevalent among less educated and lower-income groups IBGE (2014); Pinto and
Ug´a (2010).
It should be highlighted there are only a few studies which did
not detect the eﬀects of education on tobacco use (Tenn et al., 2010) and on
the decision to start smoking (Koning et al., 2015) or which found a nonlinear
relationship between smoking and years of schooling (Zhu et al., 1996).

Government policies that aﬀect smoking behavior also have major implicati-
ons for public health, economic eﬃciency and government revenue goals. Accor-
ding to Keeler et al. (2001), the most important of these policies is that of taxing
tobacco, through which two objectives can be achieved simultaneously: those of
reducing tobacco consumption and of increasing government revenues. However,
there are many other studies that analyze the eﬀects of other government poli-
cies on smoking, such as anti-smoking regulations, educational campaigns and,
less obviously, schooling, which has been found to reduce tobacco use and stimu-
late healthy behaviors. Table 3.1 shows some results of previous studies on the
relationship between education, health and smoking.

3. Methodology

3.1. Data and sample

We use data from the Special Survey on Tobacco Addiction (PETab, in the
Brazilian acronym) that was jointly carried out with the 2008 National Household
Sampling Survey (PNAD, in the Brazilian acronym). The survey was conducted
through a partnership between the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Sta-
tistics (IBGE, in the Brazilian acronym), the Ministry of Health, the National
Cancer Institute (INCA, in the Brazilian acronym), the Health Surveillance Se-
cretariat (SVS, in the Brazilian acronym) and the National Health Surveillance
Agency (ANVISA, in the Brazilian acronym).

The data was collected from a sub-sample of households surveyed through the
PNAD 2008, covering individuals aged 15 and above in about 51,000 Brazilian
households. The individuals included in that sub-sample answered questions
related to the use of tobacco products, to their attempts to quit smoking, to

8

their exposure to smoke and to their access to awareness-raising campaigns and
to information on the risks of smoking, among other issues related to the main
topic. For other people interviewed through the PNAD 2008, information is only
available for the habit of smoking, type of tobacco product used and amount
consumed.

It should be noted that the PETab survey is carried out in Brazil as part of
an initiative of the World Health Organization (WHO) and of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. This partnership was established with the aim
of promoting part of a survey conducted in 14 countries, including Brazil, entitled
Global Adults Tobacco Survey (GATS)6.

Table 2 shows the variables selected in the PETab survey to be used for
modeling the decision to smoke and the intensity of cigarette consumption. These
characteristics were chosen based on the theoretical and empirical literature cited
in the 2 section.

The individual characteristics that we used included indicators for males,
race/color and position in the occupation, in addition to age and household per
capita income. As for geographic characteristics, we included dummy variables
for urban area and metropolitan region. We believe that cigarette consumption
is higher in those areas, since in rural areas, for example, chewing tobacco or

consuming cigarettes other than manufactured cigarettes are more common. We
also included dummies to capture the diversity of Brazil’s regions. In this case,
consumption is expected to be higher in Brazil’s south region, as this region
accounts for about 98% of all the tobacco produced in Brazil.

Finally, it was also possible to build variables to indicate whether the indivi-
dual had access to information of some kind about the potential risks of smoking,
whether he or she had been exposed to any cigarette ads and whether he or she
actually believed in the health risks of smoking. It should be stressed that 100%
of the respondents included in the sample used in the PETab survey believe that
smoking causes serious diseases, strokes or heart attacks or lung cancer. Further-
more, since all PNAD respondents also answered a question about whether they
used tobacco or not, we computed the proportion of smokers in the households
(Smokers (%)).

It is noteworthy that we chose to use education level than years of schooling
in the modeling to measure human capital. Our objective in this case was to
check for any non-linearity in the relationship between education and smoking,
as in the relationship found by Zhu et al. (1996). It is to be expected that more
educated individuals are better prepared to evaluate the costs and beneﬁts of
smoking.

Table 3 presents a descriptive analysis for the group of smokers and for that
of non-smokers. Based on this prior analysis, one can speculate on what the main

10

socioeconomic determinants of smoking in Brazil are.

Regarding individual characteristics, we found that tobacco consumption is
higher among men and non-Caucasians. The percentage of smokers is also higher
in the group of workers and heads of family, probably due to their greater res-
ponsibility and, therefore, to the fact that they have a more stressful life. On
average, smokers are two years older than non-smokers and the household per
capita income of smokers is lower. Although the families of both smokers and
non-smokers are on average of the same size, the number of smokers is higher in
the households of smokers.

As expected, the group of smokers is the most exposed to cigarette ads. It
is noteworthy that the average consumption of cigarettes among smokers is of
approximately 12 cigarettes a day and that about 84% of the smokers consume
manufactured cigarettes.

Finally, in Figure 1 we disaggregated the analysis between the group of smo-
kers and non-smokers for two speciﬁc variables: self-reported health status and
education. Education is clearly higher in the population of non-smokers. This
fact reinforces our hypothesis that education is a determinant of the decision to
smoke or not to smoke.

It is also noticeable that smokers reported a good or very good health sta-
tus less frequently. This last ﬁnding is only of a descriptive character, as the
relationship between health status and tobacco consumption is prone to reverse
causality, i.e.
individuals are not in good health because they don’t smoke or
they don’t smoke because they are in good health.

Figura 1: The relationship between smoking and health status or level of schooling.

Note: The result of Kolmogorov-Smirnov’s test at 1% signiﬁcance shows that the distribution of these
two characteristics is diﬀerent in the two groups.

3.2. Empirical procedures

Initially, to model the decision to smoke, we used the structure of an Additive
Random Utility Model. From this perspective, we treated the decision to smoke
as two possibilities of individual choice: to smoke (1) or not to smoke (0). Thus,

as

U0 = V0 + ε0
U1 = V1 + ε1

where U0 and U1 are the utilities when an individual decides to smoke or not to
smoke, respectively. V0 and V1 represent the deterministic components and ε0
and ε1 represent the random components of those utilities. In this regard, the
individual will choose the option providing the greater utility. Then, Y = 1 if
U1 > U0 will be observed. The probability of observing this result is given by

Pr [y = 1] = Pr [U1 > U0]

= Pr [V1 + ε1 > V0 + ε0]
= Pr [ε0 − ε1 < V1 − V0]
= F (V1 − V0)

where F is the cumulative distribution function of ε0 − ε1. It should be noted
that if V0 = x(cid:48)β0 and V1 = x(cid:48)β1, it will only be possible to identify (β1 − β0).
This means that it is not possible to check how a certain characteristic aﬀects
the utility of a choice, but how a certain characteristic aﬀects the diﬀerence in
utility provided by choices can be checked.

To make their decisions, rational individuals usually weigh the costs and be-
neﬁts of their options and, in this case, it can be inferred that people weigh
the costs and beneﬁts of smoking. Assuming that this cost-beneﬁt analysis
F (V1 − V0) is a function of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, we
have F (V1 − V0) = F (X(cid:48)β), where X is the vector of those socioeconomic and
demographic characteristics. Based on the assumption that F (·) is a normal
function, the probability of observing an individual who smokes (Y = 1) can be
written as follows

Pr (y = 1 | X) = Φ(X(cid:48)β)

Once the process involved in the individual choice of smoking or not was
investigated, we began to investigate the determinants of the addiction intensity,
i.e. the amount of cigarettes smoked a day. Therefore, it is essential to consider
the fact that the amount of cigarettes consumed is in part determined by the
decision of an individual to smoke or not, meaning that a self-selection process
is involved.

12

A common approach is that of using a bivariate sample selection model in
1i determines both the decision of the individual Y1i and

which a latent variable y∗
the amount of cigarettes consumed Y2i. The selection equation is given by

(cid:40)

If there are strong indications of non-correlation between the terms of the two
equations above, applying an estimator obtained by OLS in the second equation
would be consistent. However, the hypothesis that there are no observable cha-
racteristics inﬂuencing both the decision to smoke and the amount of cigarettes
consumed cannot be refuted. In this case, it is a usual procedure to estimate by
OLS the following model for the values of Y2

y2i = X

(cid:48)

where υ1 is the error term, σ12 is the correlation between the errors and

Alternatively, the number of cigarettes consumed can be modeled from the
perspective of a counting process. That is, we assume that the number of ciga-
rettes consumed follows a Poisson distribution Pr[Y = y] = e−µµy
, where µ is the
mean and y = 0, 1, 2, ..., n. However, this distribution will only be appropriate
under the equidispersion property, i.e. E[Y ] = V [Y ] = µ.
In the presence of
overdispersion, the process is best modeled by a Negative Binomial distribution,
where E[y | µ, α] = µ e V [y | µ, α] = µ(1 + αµ).

y!

In addition, an excessive amount of zeros must be considered in a counting
process. In the case of the amount of cigarettes, there are a lot of zeros due to
non-smokers. Then, it is advisable to model the decision process in two stages as

13

(cid:40)

f1(0)
1−f1(0)
1−f2(0) f2(y)

f (y) =

se y = 0
se y ≤ 1

In this approach, known as Hurdle Model, the two parts are functionally
independent. According to Cameron and Trivedi (2009), this hypothesis can be
relaxed if it can be assumed that zero can occur either as a decision process or
as a counting process, as in the following distribution

(cid:40)

f (y) =

f1(0) + {1 − f1(0)}f2(0)
{1 − f1(0)}f2(y)

sey = 0
se y ≤ 1

Therefore, given that the amount of cigarettes f (y) is a process such as that
described in the equation above, the eﬀect of a particular characteristic of an
individual, if there is equidispersion, is calculated through a poisson regression
with inﬂated zeros. Otherwise, the most appropriate procedure is to admit that
the decision process follows a normal distribution and that f2(·) has a negative
binomial distribution. In this case, the estimation is done using a zero-inﬂated
negative binomial (ZINB) model.

So both the probit model and the ﬁrst stage of the selection model will be
used for us to investigate the decision to smoke, while the second stage of the
sample selection model and the count model are intended to analyze the intensity
of cigarette consumption.

Regarding the sample selection model, parameter ρ was signiﬁcant at 1%,
i.e. we reject the hypothesis that the two equations are independent.
In the
count models, in turn, at a signiﬁcance level of 1% we reject the equidispersion
hypothesis (V [y | x] = E[y | x]). Next, the Vuong test showed that a zero
inﬂation is indeed observed and, therefore, that the ZINB models are preferable.
Table 4 shows the marginal eﬀects estimated for each model, with the obser-
vation that for the sample selection models we computed the marginal eﬀect of
both the ﬁrst and the second stage on the censored average7. Therefore, the ﬁrst
two columns show the eﬀect of the variables on the decision to smoke. The last
two columns show in turn the eﬀect on the number of cigarettes consumed per
day.

Note that the marginal eﬀect estimated for the regressor set that was used is
very similar in both the analysis of the decision to smoke and in the analysis of
the intensity of addiction, regardless of the modeling strategy. For the most part,
marginal eﬀects were statistically signiﬁcant and showed the expected direction.

Special mention should be made of the variable that captures the self-declared
health status status. A negative relationship between health status and the de-
cision to smoke or the intensity of cigarette consumption only exists for those
who reported that they were in very good health. Apart from these features,
the variables indicating urban area and large city do not seem to inﬂuence the
decision to smoke.

4. Results

As seen in the previous subsection, the results were little sensitive to the mo-
deling strategy that was used. This goes for both the analysis of the determinants
of the decision to smoke and for the analysis of the determinants of the amount
of cigarettes smoked daily.

Based on the estimations that were done, we sought to answer the following
questions. What are the socioeconomic characteristics associated with the deci-
sion to smoke and with the intensity of cigarette consumption? What role does
education play in relation to tobacco addiction? The assumptions that guided
this study so far, as listed in Section 1, are the following ones: “education redu-
ces the probability of an individual being a smoker ” and “education reduces the
intensity of tobacco use if the individual is a smoker ”.

The estimates presented in Table 4 provide strong evidence that investing in
human capital, represented here by one’s schooling level, tends to reduce both
the likelihood of smoking and the intensity of cigarette consumption. Thus, our
results support the hypotheses made above.

More educated individuals are on average less likely to smoke, and when they
do decide to smoke they tend to consume fewer cigarettes daily. Our estimates
indicated, at means, a reduction of 0.09 percentage points in the probability of
smoking (p.p.) for more educated individuals and that they tend to smoke about
1 cigarette less per day as compared to uneducated individuals.

Our evidence corroborates the ﬁndings of other studies that we investigated.
In Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2006), Kendler et al. (1999), Madden (2008) and
(Grimard and Parent, 2007) evidence is also provided that years of schooling
have a negative eﬀect on the likelihood of smoking. However, after controlling
for endogeneity between years of schooling and smoking, (Koning et al., 2015)
found no statistically relevant relationship between education and the decision
to smoke. Regarding the amount of cigarettes smoked, both Cutler and Lleras-
Muney (2006), and De Walque (2007) provide evidence similar to the one provided
here.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the eﬀect of education on smoking behavior
can be described as follows: (i) higher levels of education aﬀect the way indivi-
duals think and make decisions (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2006), (ii) education

16

prevents people from adopting behaviors that can be harmful to their health in
the future (Koning et al., 2015) and (iii) lead to a better understanding of the
costs associated with smoking.

The specialized literature acknowledges the robust relationship between edu-
cation and health. Our estimates are in line with those done in other empirical
studies, since the albeit not causal relationship between education and health is
expressed here by the negative eﬀect of the level of education on tobacco addic-
tion.

As for the other controls, we observed that the higher the household income,
the lower the probability of an individual smoking.
Its negative eﬀect on the
intensity of tobacco addiction was in turn only captured in the sample selection
model. On average, the older an individual, the higher the probability that he
or she is a smoker, but the eﬀect of age on the addiction intensity is minimal.
Being a male or the family head are also factors that on average increase both
the probability of smoking and the number of cigarettes consumed per day.

As the percentage of smokers in a household increases, the risk of an individual
being a smoker increases by approximately 0.3 p.p., while the amount of cigarettes
smoked increases by 4 units. This result corroborates the ﬁndings of the previous
literature. Analyses conducted with adolescents in the 10-20 age bracket and even
with older smokers show that most of them have relatives who also smoke. This
relationship is one of the most inﬂuential risk factors for the onset of smoking.
The eﬀects can be even stronger for young people from low-income families and
young parents with low education, factors that can lead to persistent family cycles
(or cycle of deprivation) throughout one’s life as a smoker8.

The information on the risks of smoking and tobacco ads consists in variables
with high statistical signiﬁcance and expected sign. That is, the more informa-
tion, the lower the probability of smoking and the lower the amount of cigarettes
consumed. It is to be expected that rational individuals avoid risky behaviors.
This eﬀect can occur through two channels. The ﬁrst one would be through edu-
cation, i.e. the more educated individuals are, the better they understand the
health risks posed by tobacco use. The second one would be through access to
information, i.e. individuals with access to information or who seek information
are more likely to use it in connection with their decision to smoke or not to
smoke. With regard to advertising, its estimated eﬀect was as expected. The
variable indicating exposure to any tobacco advertising strategies has a positive
sign and high statistical signiﬁcance both for the decision to smoke and for the
number of cigarettes consumed per day.

8For a more detailed discussion on the relationship between the family environment and
smoking see, for example, Hill et al. (2005), Gilman et al. (2009), Williams and Covington
(1997) and Avenevoli and Merikangas (2003)

17

Health-related characteristics also had the expected eﬀect. Individuals with
health insurance are less likely to smoke and if they do smoke they tend to
consume a lower amount of cigarettes than those without health insurance. In
addition, individuals who self-reported being in very good health are the least
likely to smoke and consume a larger amount of cigarettes. It should be noted
that these ﬁndings should not be seen as causal, since we did not control for
endogeneity resulting from reverse causality between smoking and health status.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between education and smoking
in Brazil. For this purpose, we use a national database (PETab) that makes
it possible for a wide range of information related to smoking behavior to be
used. The wealth of information used here is seldom found in other studies that
investigated this relationship.

We conducted this analysis by modeling the decision to smoke and also the
amount of cigarettes smoked per day. We therefore estimated a probitmodel, a
sample selection model and a count model (ZINB). Despite the diﬀerent modeling
strategies adopted, the results were very similar.

Although our results cannot be interpreted as indicating a causal relationship,
the evidence found in this study, besides consistent with those found in the lite-
rature, suggests that more educated individuals are less likely to smoke and that
when they do smoke they tend to consume fewer cigarettes per day. This sug-
gests that education may be the right path for controlling and reducing smoking
in Brazil. In addition to making a more informed decision in relation to smoking
or not, more educated individuals avoid risky behaviors and are better prepared
to evaluate the costs and beneﬁts of their actions.

Among the other regressors used in our analysis, we highlight the role of both
information on the risks of smoking and of exposure to cigarette ads. Perhaps as
never before, we describe the eﬀect of these variables on the decision to smoke
and on the amount of cigarettes consumed daily. The estimated and statistically
signiﬁcant marginal eﬀects presented in this study make it clear that policies for
controlling and reducing smoking through the two above-mentioned channels are
also very likely to be successful.

These secondary results is extremely important, because is in line with the
National Program of Tobacco Control. Since 1980 the Ministry of Health with
Cancer National Institute develops programs to reduce the prevalence and Mor-
bidity/mortality related to tabacco uses. Between these programs, we shed light
educational acts and some legislations, such as Law No. 10,167, sanctioned on
December 27, 2000, which restricted the advertisement of tobacco products only
to the internal part of the establishments that commercialize the product, in ad-

18

dition to prohibiting sponsorship of national events. Thus, it is possible to infer
that the actions of the National Program of Tobacco Control are focused on two
axes with great potential of success on the control of smoking between Brazilians.
Although these results provide suﬃcient inputs for policy makers, there is
still room for further investigation. For example, we have not yet investigated
the eﬀect of schooling on cessation of addiction, on attempts of cessation of
addiction and on the duration of addiction.
