Resumo: 
As Instituições de Ensino Superior (IES) são consideradas um repositório de conhecimento que 
pode contribuir para o desempenho inovador das empresas, através de uma relação cooperativa, 
colaborativa  ou  interativa.  Poucos  estudos  avaliam  quantitativamente  a  importância  da 
cooperação entre universidades e empresas, considerando o desempenho inovador das mesmas, 
para o caso do Brasil. Este estudo visa preencher esta lacuna, investigando os efeitos das 
interações  universidade-indústria  (IUE)  sobre  os  resultados  da  inovação  nas  empresas 
brasileiras,  através  de  um  método  não-paramétrico,  Propensity  Score  Matching  (PSM), 
baseado em algoritmos de pareamento de indivíduos (no caso, empresas) pertencentes a grupos 
distintos, cujo objetivo é julgar os efeitos de determinado tratamento. O método foi aplicado 
aos microdados de 2008 e 2011 da Pesquisa de Inovação Tecnológica (PINTEC) do Instituto 
Brasileiro  de  Geografia  e  Estatística  (IBGE).  Mediu-se  o  desempenho  da  inovação  por 
solicitação  de  patentes  e  por  vendas  líquidas  e  exportações  de  produtos  novos  ou 
significativamente aprimorados. Estimativas com dados de 2008 não mostraram associação 
significativa entre IUE e O desempenho da empresa inovadora. Em 2011, não se obteve 
resultados sobre os efeitos relevantes da IUE sobre as vendas líquidas de produtos inovadores. 
O único resultado robusto foi um efeito positivo e significativo da IUE sobre a exportação de 
novos produtos, em 2011. No geral, os resultados deste estudo revelam uma fraca relação entre 
a colaboração com a universidade e desempenho da empresa inovadora no Brasil.

Abstract: 
Higher  Education  Institutions  (HEIs)  are  considered  a  repository  of  knowledge  that  can 
contribute to firm’s innovative performance through cooperative, collaborative or interactive 
relationship.  Few  studies  evaluate  quantitatively  the  importance  of  cooperation  between 
universities and firms to innovative performance in Brazil. This study aims to fill this gap, 
investigating the effects of university-industry linkages (UIL) on the results of innovation in 
Brazilian  firms  through  a  non-parametric  method  of  matching  estimator  to  calculate  the 
average  treatment  effect  on  the  treated  (ATT).  Using  firm  level  data  obtained  from  the 
Technological Innovation Survey (PINTEC), collected by the Brazilian Institute of Geography 
and Statistics (IBGE) in 2008 and 2011, we measured innovation performance by patent 
applications and by net sales and exports of new or significantly improved products. Estimates

with  data  in  2008  showed  no  significant  association  between  UIL  and  innovative  firm 
performance. In 2011 we did not find relevant effects of UIL on net sales of innovative 
products. The only robust result was a positive and significant effect of UIL on the export of 
new products in 2011. Overall, the results of this study reveal a weak relationship between 
collaboration with the university and innovative firm performance in Brazil.

1 Introduction 
Innovation is related to search, discovery, adoption of new products and new processes, 
and new management techniques, as stated by Dosi (1982). According to Freeman (1987) and 
Lundvall (1998), for theoretical purposes, the concept of National Innovation System (NIS) 
should be the institutional framework for understanding the role of innovation on economic 
growth.  The  experiences  of developed  and  developing  countries  show  that  differentiated 
learning processes to promote innovation are the foundation of economic development. For 
this reason, learning activities – its nature, its determinants, and its economic effects – should 
become the focus of attention of public policy, including those aimed at developing the role of 
higher education institutions (HEIs) in promoting innovation. 
The elements that underlie the relationship between universities and firms, in order to 
promote innovative activities, constitute the so-called university industry linkages (UIL). The 
UIL is one of the ways used to promote innovation and is the focus of analysis of this study. 
The  role  of  universities  and  public  scientific  and  technological  institutions  goes  beyond 
providing skilled labor for the labor market. Companies have been surrounded by instruments 
that  facilitate  the  possibilities  of  innovation  in  their  products  and  services.  Given  the 
importance of techno-scientific processes, strengthened by partnerships between universities 
and companies, the literature considers that innovation is the way for a long-term sustained 
economic growth (Jaffe, 1989; Langford, 2000; Etzkowitz, 2009). 
This study aims to investigate the effects of university-industry linkages (UIL) on the 
results of innovation in Brazilian firms. We use data from the Technological Innovation Survey 
(PINTEC), collected by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in the years 
2008 and 2011, including firms in manufacturing and service sectors. The results of innovation 
that  will  be  considered  in  this  paper  are  patent  applications,  domestic  sales  of  new  or 
significantly improved product, and exports of new or significantly improved product. Two 
empirical strategies are used to assess the importance of UIL for innovation in Brazil: cross-
sectional ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and matching estimators to compute the 
average effect of treatment on the treated (ATT). The estimates are based on a 2008 sample 
with 7,957 firms and a 2011 sample with 6,882 firms. 
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the role of UIL 
on the firm’s innovative performance. Section 3 presents the methodology and describes the 
database used in the empirical analysis. Section 4 provides and discusses the results. Section 6 
presents some concluding remarks. 
2 Innovations and University-Industry Linkage (UIL) 
 
We use the concept of National Innovation System (NIS) to characterize the innovative 
environment. NIS is an arrangement that connects businesses and institutions in a network in 
which there may be changes in terms of technology and knowledge, in order to promote the 
accumulation of skills and learning (Lundvall, 1998). Higher education institutions (HEI), 

 

3  

universities and research centers, are part of this network, and they play a key role in technology 
transfer processes to promote innovation and to improve the performance of the firm. 
Freeman (1988) and Nelson (1993) characterize the NIS as an institutional construction. 
It could be the product of a planned and conscious action, or the result of unplanned and 
uncoordinated decisions, but it is aimed at giving impetus to the technological progress in 
complex capitalist economies. Lundvall (1998) explains that the concept of NIS involves the 
dynamics  of  a  system  that  aggregates  organizations  to  promote  science,  technology  and 
innovation. According to Lundvall (2007), the leading institutions in the NIS are the HEIs, 
because they function as a source of information for businesses and of skilled labor. The 
graduates of universities act both as innovators and as agents that balance the relationship 
between higher education and economic change through innovation. 
According  to  Freeman  (1987)  and  to  Lundvall  (1998),  the  NIS  is  a  network  of 
institutions in the public and in the private sector that promotes activities that initiate, import, 
modify and diffuse knowledge and technology. The NIS has several participants: the firms, 
with its R&D laboratories and their cooperation and interaction networks; the educational 
institutions, such as universities and/or research institutes; the financial system, capable of 
providing funding in support of innovative activities; the legal system and the governments; 
and the coordinating institutions. It should be emphasized that the concept of NIS presented 
here  postulates  the  capillarity  of  agents  and  actions  that  give  shape  to  the  institutional 
environment. 
Patel and Pavitt (1994) mention the elements that form the basis of a NIS, including the 
structures and incentives that drive technological knowledge for the promotion of economic 
development. Similarly, Freeman and Soete (1997) depict the NIS as a network of public and 
private institutions that carry out activities related to the process of creation and diffusion of 
new technologies. According to these authors, the analysis of NIS allows to identify the causes, 
directions and rhythms of creation of these new technologies. They also address the importance 
of a national system, requiring up external agents that contribute to the innovative process, and 
the subsequent technical progress resulting from economic growth. 
A retrospective of the NIS’s is presented by Nelson (1992), including an analysis for 
15 countries. Dating from the early 1990s, this study alludes to the relevant "spirit" concerning 
the nationwide technologies. There is a combination of technological capabilities of firms as a 
key source of competitive performance, built at the national level. And here lies the importance 
of universities, which assume two key roles: (i) be a place where scientists, engineers, and other 
professionals get their formal training; (ii) be a place where there is a high concentration of 
research in the disciplines associated with the development of technologies. Therefore, two 
important functions of the university can be highlighted:  teaching and research. Nelson (1993) 
specifically refers that when universities or public research laboratories contribute to national 
companies, there tends to be a direct interaction between companies and members of faculties 
or research groups, either through consulting, or by other bond mechanisms. 
Despite the benefits and gains offered by a structured and consolidated NIS as a space 
for promoting innovation, this system also receives criticism, focusing especially on the NIS 
as a methodological apparatus of analysis. Broström (2008b) criticizes the approach of the 
innovation system applied by Freeman (1987) and Lundvall (1998) arguing that it does not 
provide a robust guide on how to evaluate and analyze the possibilities of measuring the 
creation  of  knowledge.  For  example,  the  R&D  area  is  not  necessarily  configured  as  a 
measurement of innovation. Broström affirms that the NIS is just a concept, not an analytical 
tool. He proposes an analytical instrument for the study of the dynamics of innovative activities 

4  

through a new concept called Innovation System Services. This system can be defined as a set 
of factors that have potential influence on the opportunities in certain groups of actors to 
perform innovative activities efficiently.  
Broström (2008b) conducted a case study with multinational companies that invest in 
R&D in Sweden. He identified three types of factors that influenced the process of investment 
in R&D, including: (i) people with solid educational background, language skills, multiple 
skills and long-term commitment; (ii) opportunities for the creation of networks of contacts 
among similar firms, consultancies and governments to ensure high-level research on a global 
level; (iii) joint funding opportunities in R&D, leading to the creation of new networks of 
contacts. In his study, Broström suggests a migration from NIS along the lines of Freeman and 
Lundvall, which focuses on countries, regions or sectors, to a NIS with focus on stakeholder 
analysis (actors-activities nexus at hand). Showing a similar point of view, Mowery and Sampat 
(2006) understand that the NIS – and other instruments designed to understand the institutional 
framework of innovation – demonstrated deficiencies with regard to criteria to compose a data 
collection guide and to define indicators on innovation activities. The concept of NIS is, in 
broad sense, relevant and interesting. However, there is some difficulty in collecting data about 
it, identifying the stakeholders and systematizing the research that could portray the NIS. 
Regarding the role of HEIs in NIS, Mowery and Sampat (2006, p.210) argue that there is a 
process  of  reconceptualization  of  universities  and  their  institutional  role  in  national  and 
regional innovation systems: “[...] a growing number of industrial-economy and developing-
economy governments seek to use universities as instruments for knowledge-based economic 
development and change”.  
Villela and Magacho (2009) present a historical approach on the NIS development in 
Brazil. According to the authors, it is a consensus that Brazil has an immature and inefficient 
NIS compared to the developed countries innovation systems. There is in Brazil a lacking 
infrastructure of science and technology, with low articulation with the productive sector, and 
reduced contribution to the country's economic performance. 
Mansfield and Lee (1996), based on data from 1975 to 1985 for the United States 
indicate that about 10% of new products and processes in high-tech industries have developed 
based on academic research. According to Arbo and Benneworth (2007)4, universities are the 
"key-players" in the NIS. Even if universities show certain "isolation" in terms of practical 
applications in business, they promote the diffusion of ideas. However, as they are located in a 
dedicated institutional setting, the impacts of their activities occur at a regional level, especially 
considering  the  "local  support"  that  universities  can  provide,  for  example,  in  terms  of 
laboratory experiments.  Bell and Pavitt (1993) highlight the importance of the institutes of 
basic and applied research to generate new products, processes and services. 
According to Langford (2000), for a long period of time the HEIs were studied with 
focus on its role of transfering knowledge or technology, although this is a linear way to 
understand its participation in the innovation process. Over time, this framework has become 
insufficient. Uyarra (2008) reinforces this point when he says that organizations are complex 
and therefore take a number of activities that end up having direct and indirect impacts on the 
economy. He also points out the changes in the tasks of HEI over the last 25 years: from simply 
producing knowledge to creating "links" in the higher education system and in the different 
economic sectors. 
Jaffe (1989) conducted a study analyzing the influence of the university in generating 
patents and R&D in US companies. He found that university engenders R&D in firms, but the

process does not necessarily occur in the opposite direction. According to him, a government 
that enhances its system in partnership with a university tends to increase the generation of 
local innovation, expanding R&D in companies and increasing their productivity. 
Bosch et al. (2005) performed econometric exercises for Latin America with a focus on 
human capital and on absorptive capacity of firms. The authors found that the lack or shortage 
of UIL in Latin America delays its development. Still on Latin American context, Sutz (2000) 
emphasizes the efforts of universities to promote relationships with industry, and the provision 
of managed state funds to encourage innovation in the firm. 
Table 1 shows some selected studies on the impact of the UIL on innovation. The table 
is not exhaustive. Studies show similar results, in the sense that UIL is considered beneficial to 
innovation, but cooperation with the university is not always a determining factor to firm’s 
innovative performance. Cooperation is closely linked to industry and to firm characteristics, 
and may be improved by government support. There are also sectoral differences. As Lööf and 
Broström (2008) asserts, the collaboration with universities had a positive effect on innovation 
activity of large manufacturing companies, but this effect was not confirmed for companies in 
the service sector. Another difference to be highlighted is related to the type of innovation. 
According to Robin and Schubert (2013), cooperation with the university had an effect on 
product innovation, but the same result was not observed for the innovation process.

UIL Result 

There is not a clear significance 
partnerships in the development of 
innovations, since it depends on the type of 
firm and understanding of innovation. 
In one project (EUREKA), the results were 
positive. The same did not occur for another 
project (FPST). 
 

The UOL is beneficial for producers, but 
proves to be fragile. 

The UIL is beneficial to generate 
innovation and companies seek HEI to have 
access to services. 
The cooperation is closely linked to 
industry characteristics and firm. 

Cooperation is significant and can best be 
exploited by the government, since, when 
companies had greater support, the results 
were better. 
The collaboration with the university has a 
positive effect on innovation activity of 
large industrial companies, but this was not 
confirmed for service sector companies. 
Cooperation cannot ensure the success of 
the firm in technological innovation. The 
results, say the authors, may reflect the 
current stage of development of the country 
and NIS.

UIL Result 

The companies that establish cooperative 
relations with universities and research 
centers have significantly greater effects 
than the others, considering only the year 
2005. However, there was a gradual 
increase in both the coefficient when the 
significance level over the analysis period. 
Cooperation had an effect on product 
innovation, although these have not been 
found to process innovation.

3 Methodology and database 
 
The evaluation of the role of university-industry linkages (UIL) on the innovative 
output of firms in this paper was based on innovation results (patent application) and on the 
firm  performance  linked  to  innovation  (domestic  sales  of  new or  significantly  improved 
products and exports of new or significantly improved products by Brazilian companies). The 
empirical strategy used to measure the effect of these linkages is a non-parametric method of 
matching estimator, developed by Abadie and Imbens (2002) and Abadie et al. (2004), to 
calculate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Although the matching estimator 
is more adequate, since it reduces the selection bias due to the fact that companies that have 
interaction with the university are more likely to innovating, the OLS estimator is useful to 
establish  a  preliminary  analysis  of  the  relationship  between  innovation  and  UIL  as  a 
benchmark. 
3.1 Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) 

 
 
The OLS estimates for the years of 2008 and 2011 are used to identify the relationship 
between UIL and three dependent variables: (i) the patent application, (ii) the domestic sales 
of  new  or  significantly  improved  products,  and  (iii)  the  exports  of  new  or  significantly 
improved products by Brazilian companies5. The idea is to find the effect of UIL on innovation, 
controlling for other possible explanatory factors, which are based on the characteristics of 
firms that influence their innovative capacity. The literature on the impact of university-
industry linkages suggests a long list  of characteristics that affect the firm’s decision to 
establish a relationship with universities, such as: adoption of foreign technology, size of 
company, R & D expenses, market share, market structure, prices of inputs, labor relations, 
property rights, among other institutional aspects of the firms (Karshenas and Stoneman, 1995). 
The choice of the independent variables in this study follows the literature and was based on 
Lööf and Broström (2008), with adjustments for the data available in our source of data, the 
Technological Innovation Survey (PINTEC)6. Equation (1) was specified to investigate the 
relationship between innovation and interaction with the university.  
Dependent variable = α + β0 UIL + β1 innov_input + β2 hum_cap + β3 innov_exports + β4 employment_sit + β5

5 The information about patent applications is not available in 2011. For this reason, the regressions in this year 
were specified only for net sales and exports. 
6 Lööf & Broström (2008) used the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) III in Sweden and this study used the 
Technological Innovation Survey (PINTEC) in Brazil. Both surveys are inspired by the Oslo Handbook (FINEP, 
2005). The Handbook was developed in the early 1990s and was intended to serve as guidance for the data 
gathering on technological innovation.

In  this  specification,  the  dependent  variables  are  patents,  innov_net_sales,  and 
 
 
The second empirical strategy makes use of the ATT matching estimator. A discussion 
about ATT matching estimators can be found on Rubin (1977), Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), 
Heckmann and Ichimura (1997), Wooldrige (2002), Heckmann and Navarro-Lozano (2004), 
Imbens (2004), Abadie et al. (2004) and Imbens and Wooldrige (2008). The first step to 
estimate the ATT is to calculate the propensity score matching (PSM), obtained by separating 
the firms into two groups according to the importance attached to universities or research 
institutes as partners for innovative activities. A categorical variable about the importance of 
UIL to the firm, reported in PINTEC’s questionnaire, was used to classify the firms in each 
group. For each firm in the treatment group (firms with collaboration with universities) we 
identify firms in the control group  (firms without collaboration with universities) whose 
characteristics are similar. The idea of matching is to identify firms with no collaboration with 
the university with the same probability to interact with universities as the collaborative firms.

A logistic model was used for calculating the PSM. The dependent variable refers to 
the probability of the firm to interact with the university. The firms are matched according to 
the PSM. The model must contain the relevant variables to explain the propensity to interact 
with universities and these variables should be chosen based on firm’s characteristics that 
influence the decision to engage in collaboration with the university. Following the literature, 
the variables in the OLS regression described in the previous section were used to estimate the 
logistic model. The methodology used in the empirical model is described in Abadie et al. 
(2004). 
In formal terms, we consider a firm i, i=1,…,N and an innovation performance variable 
Y (patent application, for example). There are two possible outcomes: Yi(1) is the performance 
of firm i when it attributed high or medium importance for universities or research institutes as 
partners for innovative activities (UIL =1); Yi(0) is the performance of firm i when it attributed 
low importance or did not developed partnerships for innovative activities (UIL=0). We are 
interested in the difference τ(i) = Yi(1) – Yi(0). The problem is that τ(i) can’t be calculated, since 
Yi(1) and  Yi(0) are not both observable for the same firm.  We use the matching approach to 
solve this problem.  
Matching the firms requires a conditional independence assumption. Conditional on a 
vector of explanatory variables X to innovation performance, the fact that the firm maintains 
or  not  a  collaborative  relationship  with  the  university  must  be  independent  of  the  non-
collaborative firm performance. This is why the logistic model should include all the variables 
that are relevant to explain both collaboration and performance of non-collaborative firms. 
Each individual of the treatment group (firms with collaboration with the university) will have 
a pair in the control group (firms without collaboration with the university) with similar values 
of the variables that compose X. In this sense, conditional on X, Yi(0) for UIL=0 has the same 
distribution of Yi(0) for UIL=1. Comparing the two groups allow us to estimate the average 
effect of treatment on the treated (ATT). 

3.3 Database 
 
The data used in this study was provided by the Technological Innovation Survey 
(PINTEC), conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). PINTEC 
builds national and regional industry indicators about technological innovation activities in 
Brazilian firms and is considered the main source on innovation in Brazil. We used 2008 and 
2011 surveys in our investigation. PINTEC 2008 refers to information collected from 2006 to 
2008, and PINTEC 2011 refers to 2009 to 2011 period. In PINTEC’s questionnaire, firms are 
asked about the importance of universities or research institutes as partners for innovative

activities11. We considered firms with university-industry linkages (UIL) those that pointed out 
alternatives 1 (high importance) or 2 (medium importance) in the questionnaire. Those that 
marked alternative 3 (low importance) or alternative 4 (did not develop partnership with the 
university), and those who did not answer the question were considered firms without UIL12. 
The  2008  data  has  7,957  innovative  firms,  including  manufacturing  and  services 
sectors. The sample used in this study consisted of 626 firms with UIL (treatment group) and 
7,331 without UIL (control group). In the group of innovative firms stand out the food products 
manufacturing industries (786 firms), the information technology services (629 firms) and 
machinery and equipment manufacturing (568 firms). In the group of innovative firms with 
UIL, the activities of information technology services (82 firms) and manufacture of computer 
equipment, electronic and optical products (57 firms) are noticeable. 
The sample of 2011 contains 6,882 firms in the manufacturing and services sectors. The 
available data cover a total of 735 firms with UIL (treatment group) and 6,147 firms without 
UIL (control group). The main activities in the group of innovative firms are support to the 
extraction of minerals (682 firms) and machinery and equipment manufacturing (572 firms). 
In the group of innovative firms with UIL stands out the sector of food products manufacturing 
(86 firms). 
  
 
4 Findings 
 
According to the OLS estimates in 2008 (Table 3), the UIL coefficient is positive and 
significant for patent applications and for net sales and exports, suggesting that there is a 
positive effect of collaboration between firms and universities on innovation. In addition to 
UIL, the variables inc_fiscal_2, patent_invention and patent_model also showed positive and 
significant coefficients for the three dependent variables. The variable innov_exports, which 
was included as an independent variable in the first two models, also showed positive and 
significant  coefficients.  Thus,  when  firms  used  tax  incentives  of  Informatics  Law  as 
government support for their innovative activities (inc_fiscal_2) and when they had patents to 
protect product and/or process innovations (patent_invention and patent_model), the firms 
achieved positive results in terms of patent applications and domestic sales and exports of new 
or significantly improved products. In the case of exports (innov_exports), the estimates show 
it has positive effects on the patent application and on net sales. 
The results of 2011 show that the UIL coefficients are positive and significant for net 
sales and exports, confirming the results of 2008 with respect to the relevance of the interaction 
of the firm with the university on innovation. Other independent variables also exhibited 
positive and significant coefficients. This is the case of the coefficient of inc_fiscal_2, which 
reinforces  the  results  obtained  in  the  2008  regression.  The  coefficient  of  the  variable 
financ_proj_without_coop, that refers to firms that used funding to R&D and technological 
innovation projects without partnership with universities or research institutes, show that the 
firms that requested such funding obtained positive results on net sales and on exports. The 
variable impact_2, which refers to the "high", "medium" or "low" importance that the firm 
attaches to the impacts of product and process innovations implemented to open new markets,

presented coefficients that suggest that this kind of innovation has positive effects on net sales 
and exports. 
Taking into account the results of 2008 and 2011, the variable market_br, with respect 
to the main market of the firm, should be highlighted. In the case of the dependent variable 
innov_net sales, the coefficient of market_br was positive and significant. This result makes 
sense, since it refers to the income of domestic sales of new or significantly improved product. 
If the focus is the domestic market, it is expected positive effect of the product with innovation 
on domestic sales. On the other hand, the coefficient for this variable is negative and significant 
for  the  dependent  variable  innov_export.  According  to  the  model,  there  is  a  negative 
relationship between the performance of exports linked to innovation and the fact that the main 
market of the firm is domestic. 
Table 4 shows the results of the logistic model used to compute the propensity score 
with 2008 and 2011 data. In 2008 estimates, the largest part of the independent variables 
showed  positive  and  significant  coefficients  for 
the  dependent  variables  patents, 
innov_net_sales and innov_exports. Two results stand out. The first refers to the variable 
market_br, which presented negative and significant coefficients, indicating that the firm

large_comp  was  positive  and  significant,  while 

13  
whose main market is domestic is less likely to UIL. The second relates to the size of the firm. The 
logistic model for patents and net sales showed a positive and significant coefficient for the variable 
large_comp, pointing out that companies with 500 or more employees are more likely to UIL, 
compared to medium and small and micro companies. The logistic model for exports, which has the 
large company as reference, presented negative and significant coefficients for micro_small_comp 
and medium_comp variables. This reinforces the result of higher tendency of large companies to UIL. 
The logistic model for 2011 also presented most of the independent variables with positive 
and significant coefficients. The results accentuate the importance of the size of the firm for the 
propensity to UIL. In the model for net sales, in which the variable medium_comp was the reference, 
the  coefficient  of 
the  coefficient  of 
micro_small_comp was negative and significant. In the model for exports, the large_comp was the 
reference,  and  the  coefficients  of  micro_small_comp  and  medium_comp  were  negative  and 
significant. In both models, the results of 2008 were confirmed: the larger the company, the higher 
the propensity to interact with the university. This result corroborates what was found in Varzim and 
Monsueto (2011). 
In order to obtain the estimated ATT, the propensity score was used for pairing the group of 
innovative firms with UIL with the group of similar firms that are not engaged in UIL. We used four 
matching algorithms to increase the robustness of the results and give more consistency to the 
analysis: (1) One-to-one, (2) Nearest neighbor, (3) Radius, and (4) Kernel. The results are in Tables 
5 and 6. In all types of matching, the effect of UIL on innovation was positive for the dependent 
variables patents, innov_net_sales, and innov_exports in 2008 (Table 5). The same is observed in 
2011 (Table 6) for the dependent variables innov_net_sales and innov_exports. However, in 2008 the 
ATT was significant only for the variable patents in kernel-based matching. In 2011 the ATT was 
significant  for  the  variable  innov_exports  in  all  kinds  of  matching  and  for  the  variable 
innov_net_sales in kernel-based matching. Although some results seem to prove that the relationship 
with the university affects the innovation performance of firms, other results do not allow establishing 
this conclusion. The results for 2011, for example, suggest that the influence of collaboration with 
the university is significant for the exports of products with innovation. However, the 2008 results 
do not confirm this inference. 
The results found in this study are related to what was described in the literature presented in 
section 2, which reports mixed results on the effects of UIL on innovation. In the case of patents, 
where data is available only in the 2008 survey, the results confirm what was found by Marins (2010). 
According to him, despite being a traditional indicator of innovation in developed countries, patent 
applications are not as relevant in developing countries. Lööf and Broström (2008) also refer to 
inconclusive results of UIL on innovation when samples are separated by type of firm. They found 
that collaboration with the University positively influences the sales innovation as well as the 
propensity for submission of patents for industrial companies with 100 or more employees. However, 
considering the total number of companies, including manufacturing and services, the results show 
no significant association between collaboration with universities and innovation. According to the 
authors, "some of the estimates suggest interaction between universities and firms affects innovation 
performance and some does not. The differences are on the one hand explained by firm size and by 
sector, on the other hand by the different applications of matching estimators" (Loof, Broström, 2008, 
p 87). In our paper most ATT estimates were not significant, revealing a weak association of UIL 
with innovation.

The quality of the matching procedures can be assessed in the last lines of Tables 5 and 6 by 
 
the pseudo R2 and by the mean absolute standardized bias, before and after matching. It is expected 
a lower pseudo R2 (near zero) after matching, which occurred in all cases. There should be no 
systematic differences in the distribution of covariates between the two groups, therefore the pseudo 
R2 must be reasonably low (Caliendo and Kopeining, 2005). Finally, we observed bias reduction after 
matching in all estimates. 
 
5 Conclusions 

 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the university-industry linkages (UIL) in terms of their 
effects on innovation, focusing on the performance of Brazilian firms. Although some of the literature 
on the subject supports the hypothesis that there is influence of cooperation with the university on 
the innovative capacity of the firm, some studies do not identify causal relationship between UIL and 
innovation. The results of our study indicate that, in Brazil, collaboration with the university has a 
weak relationship with innovation, when it is measured by patent applications and net sales and 
exports of new or significantly improved products. 
We used two empirical strategies to evaluate the effect of collaboration with the university on 
innovation. In the first strategy, we run cross-sectional ordinary least squares regressions with 2008 
and 2011 data. The results showed a positive and significant influence of the collaboration with the 
university on the innovative performance of the firm. However, the second empirical strategy, which 
consisted in the use of matching estimators to determine the average effect of treatment on the treated 
(ATT), exhibited ambiguous results. Estimates made with the 2008 sample, despite having positive 
coefficients for the UIL, showed no significant association between collaboration with universities 
and innovative firm performance, measured in terms of patent applications and net sales and exports 
of new or significantly improved products. According to estimates in 2011, which did not include 
patent applications for lack of data, there is also no association between UIL and net sales of 
innovative products. Considering different matching algorithms, the only robust result was a positive 
and significant effect of UIL on the export of new products in 2011.
