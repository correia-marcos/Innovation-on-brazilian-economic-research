Abstract 

 

Sovereign credit ratings play an important role in determining  the terms and the extent 
to  which  countries  have  access  to  international  capital  markets,  mainly  for  developing 
countries. With this in mind, this study analyzes the determinants of sovereign ratings of 
developing  countries  given  by  Standard  &  Poor’s,  Moody’s  and  Fitch  for  the  period 
1994-2013. Regarding the econometric model, besides usual OLS method for panel data 
analysis, we make use of dynamic panel data framework (D-GMM and S-GMM). Our 
findings show that there is a basic set of macroeconomic variables that affect sovereign 
ratings:  GDP  growth,  per  capita  GDP,  inflation,  foreign  reserves,  government  budget 
balance  and  external  debt.  Moreover,  the  adoption  of  the  inflation  targeting,  greater 
financial openness and democratic accountability enhance the ratings of three agencies, 
while exchange rate stability, law and order and less corruption increase the ratings of at 
least one agency.

Resumo 

 
Notas de crédito soberano possuem um importante papel para determinar os termos e a 
magnitude  com  que  os  países  têm  acesso  aos  mercados  de  capitais  internacionais, 
especialmente os países em desenvolvimento. Com isso em mente, esse  estudo analisa 
os determinantes das notas de crédito soberano da Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s e Fitch 
de países em desenvolvimento. Quanto ao modelo econométrico, além do usual método 
MQO  para  dados  em  painel,  empregamos  uma  análise  de  dados  em  painel  dinâmicos 
(D-GMM  e  S-GMM).  Nossos  achados  mostram  que  existe  um  conjunto  básico  de 
variáveis macroeconômicas que afetam as notas das agências: crescimento do PIB, PIB 
per capita, reservas internacionais, orçamento do governo e dívida externa. Além disso, 
a  adoção  de  metas  para  inflação,  maior  abertura  financeira  e  responsabilidade 
democrática  elevam  as  notas  das  três  agências,  enquanto  que  inflação,  estabilidade  da 
taxa de câmbio, cumprimento da lei e da ordem e menos corrupção aumentam as notas 
de pelo menos uma das agências. 

Palavras-chave:  risco  soberano;  meta  para  inflação;  abertura  financeira;  democracia;

1. Introduction 
 

Sovereign  credit  ratings  play  an  important  role  in  determining  the  terms  and  the 
extent  to  which  countries  have  access  to  international  capital  markets.  According  to 
Reinhart (2002), while developed countries take international capital market access for 
granted, on the other hand, many low income countries have no access to international 
lending  even  under  relatively  favorable  conditions.  In  turn,  regarding  developing 
countries, access to international capital markets is highly variable across time. It is for 
these  developing  economies  that  the  sovereign  credit  ratings  play  their  most  critical 
role. 

Sovereign  ratings  are  a  condensed  assessment  of  a  government’s  ability  and 
willingness  to  repay its  public debt  on time. A rating is  a forward-looking  estimate of 
the default probability, i.e., sovereign credit ratings are supposed to serve as a summary 
measure of a country’s likelihood of default (Cantor and Packer, 1996; Reinhart, 2002). 
Such  measures  of  the  probability  of  default  are  particularly  relevant  for  international 
financial  markets,  economic  agents,  and  governments  (Bissoondoyal-Bheenick,  2005; 
Afonso, Gomes and Rother, 2011). 

In recent years, the demand for sovereign ratings has increased mainly due to the 
inevitable  globalization  of  markets.  Investors  and  particularly  managed  funds  are 
increasingly focused on international diversification. A change in sovereign ratings can 
be a major input in the re-weighting of international portfolios (Bissoondoyal-Bheenick, 
2005). Therefore, governments and investors have the need to understand what factors 
rating agencies put more emphasis on when attributing a rating score. 

The  main  private  credit  risk  rating  agencies  are  Moody’s  Investors  Service, 
Standard  &  Poor’s  (S&P),  and  Fitch  ratings.  These  agencies  use  a  combination  of 
several quantitative and qualitative variables (economic, social, and political) in order to 
assign  a  credit  rating  to  a  debtor.  Because  they  do  not  announce  their  methodologies 
explicitly,  an  important  issue  is  to  identify  the  factors  behind  their  assignment  of 
sovereign  credit  ratings.  Although  there  are  studies  on  the  determinants  of  sovereign 
ratings  (Cantor  and  Packer,  1996;  Afonso,  2003;  Altenkirch,  2005;  Hill,  Brooks  and 
Faff,  2010;  Afonso,  Gomes  and  Rother  2011),  the  literature  that  addresses  solely  the 
category of developing countries is still scarce (Archer, Biglaiser and DeRouen, 2007; 
Biglaiser and Staats, 2012; Erdem and Varli, 2014).  

This  study  investigates  the  determinants  of  sovereign  risk  ratings  in  developing 
countries. Some of the economic relationships  studied in  this paper  have already been 
investigated  in  the  literature.  Therefore,  in  addition  to  the  economic  aspects1 
traditionally  addressed  in  studies  of  this  nature,  the  present  study  contributes  to  the 
literature by adding other important economic aspects which have not yet been analyzed 
and  which  have  guided  economic  policy  decisions  in  many  countries  from  the  1990s. 
Among  the  new  aspects  analyzed  in  this  study  is  the  effect  caused  by  the  adoption  of 
inflation  targeting.  The  adoption  of  this  economic  policy  framework  by  a  number  of 
countries  (developed  and  developing)  from  the  1990s  redefined  the  way  to  conduct 
monetary  and  fiscal  policies.  Moreover,  it  attributed  greater  importance  to  the 
commitment  made  by  the  governments  in  relation  to  their  goals  and  therefore  to  the 
issues related to credibility, reputation  and  transparency.  In this sense, the adoption of 
inflation targeting may have contributed to  improving sovereign risk ratings, since the 
countries that have adopted this strategy had to increase the level of accountability and 
commitment  to  the  established  (fiscal  and  monetary)  objectives.  Also  with  regard  to 
                                                           
1  These  economic  aspects  are:  GDP  per  capita,  GDP  growth,  inflation,  unemployment,  budget 
balance/GDP, reserves/GDP and foreign debt service/exports. 

economic  aspects, due to the fact that developing countries are strongly  influenced by 
disorders  that  affect  the  international  liquidity,  the  behavior  of  exchange  rates  and  the 
mood  of  financial  markets,  we  added  the  effects  of  financial  openness,  exchange  rate 
stability  and  the  subprime  crisis.  In  this  sense,  we  contribute  to  the  literature  by 
providing new findings about the economic determinants of sovereign risk ratings.  

In turn, since we are looking at developing countries, institutional and governance 
aspects  must  also  be  considered.  These  aspects  are  likely  to  affect  the  sovereign  risk 
ratings because they act on the institutional design of governments and on the way that 
governments  operate.  In  this  sense,  the  study  also  contributes  to  the  literature  since  it 
analyzes  the  effects  of  corruption,  law  enforcement  and  the  degree  of  democratic 
accountability  on  such  ratings.  The  idea  is  that  countries  will  receive  better  sovereign 
ratings once they present lower levels of corruption, stronger legal courts and higher law 
enforcement,  as  well  as  higher  levels  of  democratic  accountability.  Hence,  due  to  the 
fact that the present study also considers such aspects, the findings regarding the effects 
of these variables on sovereign credit ratings represent novelties to the literature. 

Unlike other studies, which mostly use one or two ratings in the analysis (usually 
Moody's and/or Standard & Poor's ratings), in this study, we use the three main ratings 
(Moody's,  Standard  &  Poor's,  and  Fitch’s).  We  have  compiled  a  panel  data  set  on 
sovereign risk ratings, economic data, and governance and institutional variables for 41 
developing countries2 from 1994 to 2013. A feature of the sample is that approximately 
60% of the countries in the analysis, at some point of time, ceased to pay its debts, i.e., 
have default history. Hence, default history is a characteristic of the sample. 

 

2. Literature review 
 

The  literature  regarding  the  study  of  sovereign  credit  rating  is  vast  in  different 
directions.  Some  works  analyze  the  influence  of  changes  in  sovereign  ratings  on  the 
domestic financial sector and on the inflows of international capital. This is the case of 
Kim and Wu (2008), which restricted their investigation to developing countries during 
1995-2005.  They  found  evidence  that  long-term  foreign  currency  sovereign  credit 
ratings  are  important  for  encouraging  financial  intermediary  development  and  for 
attracting  capital  flows.  Other  studies  aim  to  measure  the  accuracy  of  the  rating 
agencies. For instance, Gaillard (2013) analyzed the accuracy of the three main agencies 
from January 2001 to January 2013. His findings suggested that ratings issued by Fitch, 
Moody’s and S&P became less accurate after the default of Greece in  2012, however, 
regarding  regulatory  purposes,  credit  ratings  can  be  more  suitable  than  market-based 
indicators. On the other hand, Schumacher (2014) shed some light to the self-fulfilling 
aspect  of  sovereign  ratings.  The  results  provide  evidence  for  a  significant  two-way 
interaction  between  the  macroeconomic  environment  and  changes  in  sovereigns’ 
ratings. Thus, rating changes are able to exacerbate a country’s boom–bust cycle.  

There  are  also  studies  that  tried  to  identify  the  factors  behind  the  assessment  of 
sovereign  ratings.  This  literature  shows  that  there  is  a  basic  set  of  macroeconomic 
variables which affect sovereign credit ratings. These variables are: per capita income, 
inflation, GDP growth, external debt, fiscal balance and sovereign default history. The 
work  of  Cantor  and  Packer  (1996)  investigates  the  main  determinants  of  sovereign 
credit  ratings  given  by  S&P  and  Moody’s.  Their  findings  indicate  that  per  capita 
income,  GDP  growth  and,  economic  development  positively  affect  sovereign  credit 

                                                           
2  The  classification  of  countries  as  developing  countries  follows  the  classification  of  the  International 
Monetary Fund (World Economic Outlook – WEO).

ratings  while  inflation,  external  debt  and  default  history  have  a  negative  influence  on 
ratings. Using the rating classifications of S&P and Moody's, Afonso (2003) expanded 
the analysis for a universe of 81 developed and developing countries in June 2001. He 
finds  significant  results  for  the  same  group  of  independent  variables  as  Cantor  and 
Packer  (1996)  for  both  agencies,  however,  external  debt  as  a  percentage  of  exports  is 
relevant only for developing countries.  

Altenkirch  (2005)  widened  the  analysis  of  the  determinants  of  sovereign  ratings 
by  pointing  out  that  a  bias  in  the  previous  results  of  the  literature  might  had  occurred 
regarding  the  adoption  of  OLS  and  POLS  techniques.  In  this  sense,  he  combines  a 
general-to-specific  model  selection  with  dynamic  panel  data  estimation  in  order  to 
resolve  this  issue.  The  analysis  refers  to  the  determinants  of  sovereign  credit  ratings 
given by Moody’s to 26 countries. Using a wide range of variables, a model is specified 
with the following regressors: inflation, the ratio of the current account balance to GDP, 
the  ratio  of  foreign  reserves  to  GDP,  the  ratio  of  domestic  savings  to  GDP,  political 
rights,  regional  warfare,  growth  in  exports,  and  the  ratio  of  total  debt  to  GDP.  As 
opposed  to  the  previous  studies,  inflation  had  mixed  results  regarding  its  significance, 
and  only  political  rights  and  the  export  growth  rate  showed  significant  results  in  all 
dynamic panel data estimations. 

Bissoondoyal-Bheenick  (2005)  analyzes  the  determinants  of  sovereign  ratings 
provided  by  the  two  main  agencies  (Standard  and  Poor’s  and  Moody’s).  The  analysis 
also provides a forecast of the ratings to be assigned to the countries based on the model 
used as well as providing ratings to be assigned to a set of weaker economies which are 
not  actually  rated  by  the  rating  agencies.  The  sovereign  ratings  was  discriminated  in 
three different groups, one with the full sample of 95 countries, other with only 25 high 
rated  countries  and  one  last  with  only  70  low  rated  countries.  The  ordered  response 
model estimation was adopted for the period from December 1995 to December 1999. 
The  set  of  independent  variables  for  the  full  sample  was:  per  capita  income,  inflation, 
fiscal  balance,  debt-to-GDP  ratio,  real  exchange  rate,  foreign  reserves  and  the  net  of 
exports  as  percentage  of  GDP.  Furthermore,  unemployment  and  unit  labor  cost  were 
included  in  the  estimation  for  the  high  rated  countries,  whilst  in  the  case  for  the  low 
rated  countries,  the  net  export/GDP  was  replaced  by  current  account  balance  and  the 
external  debt  was  included.  Per  capita  income  and  inflation  rate  showed  the  most 
significant  results  for  both  group  of  countries.  Specifically  for  the  low  rated  group, 
current  account  balance  and  the  level  of  foreign  reserves  played  an  important  role  to 
determine the level  of sovereign ratings as well. The main  finding of the paper is  that 
current  economic  and  financial  indicators  alone  do  not  determine  ratings.  In  addition, 
the  relevance  of  economic  variables  is  not  the  same  across  the  different  rating 
categories. Economic variables do not carry the same importance for the sample of high 
rated  countries  with  a  long  financial  stability  history  as  compared  to  the  low  rated 
sample of countries that are still undergoing structural changes. 

In  addition  to  S&P  and  Moody’s,  some  works  also  include  Fitch’s  rating  in  the 
analysis  regarding  the  determinants  of  sovereign  credit  ratings.  Hill,  Brooks  and  Faff 
(2010) verify the determinants of sovereign ratings of these three main rating agencies 
by covering a large sample of countries (129 countries) over the period from April 1990 
to  March  2006.  Additionally  to  the  independent  variables  taken  in  consideration  in 
Cantor and Packer (1996),  the study  of Hill, Brooks and Faff  (2010) also includes the 
square of GDP growth, the Institutional Investor country risk, derived from the opinions 
of financial experts, and the market premium risk. The results showed that six variables 
are  common  determinants  of  all  three  agencies  sovereign  ratings:  per  capita  income, 
GDP growth and its square, default history, the Institutional Investor rating and the risk 

premium.  Inflation rate, current account balance, external debt and fiscal balance were 
significant for only two or fewer agencies. 

Afonso,  Gomes  and  Rother  (2011)  also  included  the  three  main  risk  ratings 
agencies – 66 countries for Moody’s, 65 for S&P and 58 for Fitch – in order to identify 
the determinants of sovereign credit ratings for the period 1995  – 2005. By applying a 
panel  data  framework  with  linear  and  ordered  response  models,  it  is  adopted  a 
specification  which  admitted  to  distinguish  between  short-  and  long-run  effects  of  the 
explanatory  variables.  A  wide  range  of  potential  determinants  were  used  in  the 
estimations  embracing  macroeconomic,  fiscal  and  external  conditions  as  well  as  the 
history  of  default  of  the  country,  whether  it  joins  the  European  Union  and  lastly  its 
geographical  location.  The  results  pointed  out  that  per  capita  income,  GDP  growth, 
government  debt,  and  the  fiscal  balance  have  a  short-run  effect  on  sovereign  default 
ratings, whilst government effectiveness, external debt, foreign reserves and the default 
history are important long-run determinants. 

Regarding  the  literature  on  the  determinants  of  sovereign  credit  ratings  of 
developing  countries,  some  works  can  be  underlined.  This  is  the  case  of  Archer, 
Biglaiser  and  DeRouen  (2007),  which  extended  the  discussion  by  adding  a  political 
aspect,  i.e.,  the  influence  of  the  so-called  “democratic  advantage”.  The  sample 
comprises  the  three  main  sovereign  credit  ratings  (S&P,  Moody’s  and  Fitch)  of  50 
developing countries, and the period runs from 1987 to 2003. The study applied a panel 
data  set,  with  three  groups  of  explanatory  variables:  (1)  regime  type  and  political 
institutions; (2) macroeconomic conditions; and (3) the default history, natural resource 
stocks  and  commitment  to  trade.  The  findings  indicated  that  political  variables  have 
little impact on sovereign credit default ratings. By the way, merely the length of tenure 
of  the  executive’s  party  showed  to  affect  sovereign  ratings  given  by  Moody’s.  On  the 
other hand, economic factors such as GDP growth, inflation, commitment to trade and 
the  default  history  disclosed  to  be  significant  variables  to  impact  sovereign  ratings  of 
developing countries.    

Biglaiser  and Staats  (2012) extended the work of Biglaiser  and DeRouen  (2007) 
by including institutional and political variables not considered before, such as society’s 
obedience to the rule of law, the presence of a reliable judicial system and the protection 
of  rights.  The  estimations  cover  36  developing  countries  for  the  period  1996  –  2006. 
Beyond 
the  political  conditions,  Biglaiser  e  Staats  (2012)  also  control  for 
macroeconomic  variables  including  per  capita  income,  GDP  growth,  external  debt, 
inflation  and  current  account  balance.  Their  findings  indicate  that  rule  of  law,  strong 
and  independent  courts,  and  protection  of  property  rights  have  significant  positive 
effects  on  ratings  of  developing  countries.  Finally,  Erdem  and  Varli  (2014)  tried  to 
determine the factors behind the assessment of sovereign ratings given by S&P of eight 
developing  countries  from  2002  to  2011.  In  addition  to  the  macroeconomic  variables 
selected by  Biglaiser e Staats  (2012), it was also  included in  the estimations the fiscal 
balance, governance indicators, foreign reserves as percentage of GDP, unemployment 
and  exchange  rate.  The  results  indicate  that  the  more  relevant  variables  related  with 
credit  ratings  of  developing  countries  are:  budget  balance,  per  capita  income, 
governance indicators and foreign reserves/GDP. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

3. Data and Methodology 
 
3.1 Data description 
 

In  this  study,  we  consider  sovereign  credit  ratings  produced  by  Standard  and 
Poor's (S&P’s) and Moody’s on a total of 41 developing countries (where 13 countries 
are inflation targeters) for the period 1994 to 2013 (see Table A.1 in the Appendix A for 
country list). Moreover, we also consider sovereign credit ratings produced by Fitch on 
a  total  of  37  developing  countries  (where  13  countries  are  inflation  targeters)  for  the 
period  1994  to  2011.3  We  use  yearly  data.  The  choice  of  this  sample  period  is  due  to 
data availability. 

In  general,  the  ratings  given  by  S&P,  Moody’s  and  Fitch  are  variations  of  the 
scale A, B or C. Conventionally, the AAA is the top rating given by all agencies. The 
lower  the  rating  indicates  the  higher  probability  of  default.  Governments  rated  above 
“BBB” are considered to have “investment grades”, while those rated below “BBB” are 
considered to  have “speculative grades”. Although the agencies use different  symbols, 
almost every Moody’s and Fitch’s symbol has its counterpart in the Standard and Poor’s 
rating scale. This correspondence allows a comparison of the sovereign ratings assigned 
by the three agencies. Table 1 below shows the scales of ratings made by the agencies, 
where we have an increasing numerical scale of risk going from 1 (highest rating) to 23 
(lowest rating). The rating assigned for a country in a specific year is the one that was 
observed in the end of that year.

Since  one  of  the  main  goals  of  the  present  study  is  to  respond  whether  the 
adoption  of  inflation  targeting  (IT)  is  important  to  improve  sovereign  credit  ratings  in 
developing countries, we must define the IT dummy variable, ITi,t. This dummy variable 
equals  to  1  if  country  i  is  an  inflation  targeter  in  period  t  and  0  if  not.  The  existing 
literature diverges on when to date the adoption of IT, whether with the start of partial 
inflation targeting (e.g., Corbo Landerretche and Schmidt-Hebbel (2002) and Gonçalves 
and  Salles  (2008)),  or  only  when  full-fledged  IT  was  adopted  (e.g.,  Mishkin  (2000), 
IMF (2006), Batini and Laxton (2007) and Brito and Bystedt (2010)). Because most of 
the  studies  works  with  Batini  and  Laxton’s  (2007)  IT  adoption  dates,  we  follow  Brito 
and Bystedt (2010) and also justify our choice based on Mishkin (2000). In addition to a 
public  announcement  of  numerical  targets  for  future  inflation,  an  inflation  targeting 
economy  has  to  fulfill  requirements  of  institutional  subordination  of  other  goals, 
information  disclosure  and  accountability.  Hence,  in  the  present  study,  the  dummy 
variable considers the dates of adoption of IT based on conservative classification4 (this 
is  the  case  where  there  exists  an  explicit  inflation  target  and  full-fledged  IT  was 
adopted). 

In  turn,  the  set  of  key  macroeconomic  fundamentals  which  we  employ  as  the 
determinants  of  sovereign  credit  ratings  from  selected  developing  countries  were 
determined based on the empirical literature, i.e., these variables are present in most of 
the  empirical  literature  regarding  the  determinants  of  sovereign  credit  ratings  (e.g., 
Afonso (2003), Bissoondoyal-Bheenick (2005) and Erdem and Varli (2014)). This set of 
macroeconomic  variables  will  comprise  our  baseline  model.  The  baseline  model 
consists  of  the  following  variables:  (GBB)  central  government  budget  balance  as  a 
percentage  of  GDP;  (FDSE)  foreign  debt  service  as  a  percentage  of  exports  of  goods 
and  services;  (GDPP)  per  capita  GDP;  (GDPG)  GDP  growth;  (INF)  inflation; 
(RESERVES)  reserves  as  percentage  of  GDP;  (UNEMP)  rate  of  unemployment,  and; 
(SUBPRIME)  dummy  variable  for  the  effect  from  the  subprime  mortgage  crisis. 
Furthermore, we have included other control variables which were not analyzed in the 
literature  yet. Therefore, we analyze other dimensions which can influence the ratings. 
Also in relation to the economic dimension, the contribution we bring is the inclusion of 
the  inflation  targeting  regime  (IT  dummy  variable),  as  well  as  the  effects  of  financial 
openness  (FOI)  and  exchange  rate  stability  (ERSI).  Regarding  the  institutional 
dimension, we will analyze the effect of democratic accountability (DEMOC) as well as 
the  effect  of  law  and  order  (LAW).  Finally,  in  the  governance  dimension,  we  will 
analyze the effect of corruption (CORRUP).5 
 
3.2 Methodology 
 

This  study  uses  panel  data  analysis.  Besides  usual  OLS  method  for  panel  data 
analysis,  we make use of dynamic panel  data framework (D-GMM and S-GMM).  As 
pointed out by Arellano and Bond (1991), an advantage of using the dynamic panel data 
method  (GMM)  over  others  (Ordinary  Least  Squares  –  OLS  and  Generalized  Least 
Squares – GLS) is that besides eliminating the non-observed effects on the regressions, 
the estimates are reliable even in the case of omitted variables. In particular, the use of 
instrumental  variables  allows  the  estimation  of  parameters  more  consistently,  even  in

the  case  of  endogeneity  in  explanatory  variables  and  the  occurrence  of  measurement 
errors (Bond, Hoeffler and Temple, 2001).  

Traditional  econometric  models  hypothesize  that  the  error  term  is  not  correlated 
with its estimators. In cases where the estimators are correlated with the error term there 
is an endogeneity problem and thus the result of regressions is inconsistent. Wooldridge 
(2001)  presents  three  hypotheses  for  the  existence  of  endogenous  variables:  omitted 
variables, measurement error, and simultaneity in regressions. Variables can be omitted 
when, for example, they are not known or not available. Measurement error can occur 
when one needs to measure the partial effect of a variable. Finally, simultaneity occurs 
when one of the explanatory variables is concomitant with the dependent variable.  

The  empirical  model  developed  in  this  study  is  subject  to  the  above-mentioned 
problems.  In  short,  not  all  explanatory  variables  of  the  model  are  known  and 
measurable.  In  addition,  the  growth  rate  of  real  GDP  can  be  influenced  by  sovereign 
credit ratings, which, in  turn, suggests a simultaneity problem.  Furthermore, regarding 
the endogeneity problem, for example, a macroeconomic shock affects sovereign credit 
ratings and thereby the growth rate of real GDP. 

A  general  solution  to  the  problem  of  endogeneity  is  the  use  of  instrumental 
variables. In particular, GMM models allow the use of instruments that are sequentially 
exogenous,  thereby  avoiding  the  endogeneity  problem.  The  model  proposed  by 
Arellano and Bond (1991) consists of the estimation of first-difference GMM panel data 
as a way of  eliminating  non-observed  effects.  However, Alonso-Borrego and Arellano 
(1998), and Blundell and Bond (1998) showed that the first-difference GMM has a bias 
(for large and small samples) and low accuracy. Moreover, the use of lags can generate 
weak instruments (Staiger and Stock, 1997). 

Blundell and Bond (1998) found results that sustain the use of the system GMM 
panel  data  estimation  method  instead  of  first-difference  GMM.  In  the  model  proposed 
by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) regressions in levels and 
first differences are combined (see Bond, Hoeffler, and Temple, 2001). 

While  D-GMM  and  S-GMM  estimation  approaches  are  suitable  for  a  small 
number of time periods (t) and a large number of individuals (i) in small samples, when 
the instruments are too many, they tend to over-fit the instrumented variables and bias 
the  results  (Roodman,  2009).  Hence,  with  the  objective  of  avoiding  the  use  of  an 
excessive number of instruments in the regressions and thus lose the power of tests, the 
number  of  instruments/number  of  cross-sections  ratio  must  be  less  than  1  in  each 
regression. Moreover, in order to confirm the validity of the instruments in the models, 
the  test  of  over-identifying  restrictions  (J-test)  was  used  as  suggested  by  Arellano 
(2003). In addition, tests of first-order (AR1) and second-order (AR2) serial correlation 
were performed. Moreover, White's heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix was 
applied  on  regressions.  It  is  important  to  highlight  that  one  premise  of  system  GMM 
models  is  the  non-correlation  of  the  first  difference  of  endogenous  regressors,  which 
implies that it is not necessary to perform unit root tests. 

Based on the variables described above, the baseline model is given by: 
 

                                                                                                                        
 
Where      is the dependent variable, and it represents the numeric rating assigned by the 
agencies to the respective country at time t. The subscript i is the index of the country,   
is  a  vector  of  unknown  parameters,      is  a  parameter,          represents  the  vector  of 
macroeconomic explanatory variables of the baseline model for country i one year ago 
(t–1), and        is the disturbance.  

The next four specifications include the variables of each dimension: 
 

                                                                                                               
 
                                                                                             
 
                                                                                       
 
                                                                                                   

 
All  explanatory  variables  (except  the  dummy  variables,  SUBPRIME  and  IT)  are 
lagged (t–1) because the ratings are not assigned at the end of the year, i.e., agencies can 
assign  different  notes  to  a  country  in  the  same  year,  and  along  it.  Therefore,  it  is 
reasonable  to  think  that  agencies  make  use  of  known  information  about  the  countries, 
i.e., the information of one year ago. 

 

4. Estimation results 
 

In  this  section,  we  evaluate  the  findings  of  the  estimates.  Tables  (2),  (3)  and  (4) 
show the estimates obtained through OLS with cross-country fixed effects (FOLS), D-
GMM and S-GMM for the five models adopted, and for the three rating agencies (S&P, 
Moody’s and Fitch, respectively). Regarding the baseline model, our estimations show 
very consistent outcomes. Whatever the method used or model employed, an increase in 
the GDP growth improves the ratings of all agencies. This result is confirmed by many 
studies  (e.g.,  Afonso,  2003;  Cantor  and  Packer,  1996;  Hill,  Brooks  and  Faff,  2010; 
Afonso, Gomes and Rother, (2011).  

Furthermore,  per  capita  income,  inflation,  foreign  reserves  and  external  debt 
showed  significant  results  for  44  of  45  estimations.  Then,  increments  in  per  capita 
income and in foreign reserves enhance the bond ratings, while the same occur through 
reductions  in  inflation  and  in  external  debt.  Similar  results  are  also  found  in  the 
literature  regarding  per  capita  income  (e.g.,  Cantor  and  Packer,  1996;  Afonso,  2003; 
Bissoondoyal-Bheenick, 2005; Hill, Brooks and Faff, 2010; Afonso, Gomes and Rother, 
2011;  Erdem  and  Varli,  2014),  foreign  reserves  (e.g.,  Bissoondoyal-Bheenick,  2005  – 
for low rated countries only; Afonso, Gomes and Rother, 2011; Erdem and Varli, 2014), 
inflation  (e.g.,  Cantor  e  Packer,  1996;  Afonso,  2003;  Altenkirch,  2005  –  for  S-GMM 
estimations  only;  Bissoondoyal-Bheenick,  2005;  Hill,  Brooks  and  Faff,  2010;  Afonso, 
Gomes  and  Rother,  2011;  Erdem  and  Varli,  2014)  and  external  debt  (e.g.,  Cantor  and 
Packer, 1996; Afonso, 2003; Hill, Brooks and Faff, 2010; Afonso, Gomes and Rother, 
2011; Erdem and Varli, 2014).  

Additionally, an increase in budget balance appeared to improve the bond ratings 
in 41 estimations. The significance of the budget balance is also found in the literature 
(e.g., Afonso, 2003 – for Moody’s in 2 specifications of the linear estimations and for 
S&P  in  one  specification  of  the  logistic  estimation;  Hill,  Brooks  and  Faff,  2010; 
Afonso,  Gomes  and  Rother,  2011;  Erdem  and  Varli,  2014).  Finally,  unemployment 
showed  mixed  results  regarding  its  significance,  but  still,  in  all  estimations  it  exhibits 
the expected signal. However, the statistic insignificance of unemployment is common 
in the literature (e.g., Bissoondoyal-Bheenick, 2005 – applied this variable only for high 

rated  countries;  Afonso,  Gomes  and  Rother,  2011  –  only  the  three-year  average  was 
significant; and Erdem and Varli, 2014).    

Now let us turn to the variables that are our main contribution into the economic 
dimension. First, the adoption of inflation targeting appears to be an important factor in 
order to improve sovereign ratings of all the three agencies. Moreover, the adoption of 
this  policy  framework  shows  to  be  able  to  enhance  sovereign  ratings.  Therefore,  this 
outcome  might  shed  some  light  to  the  concern  that  credit  rating  agencies  put  on 
commitment and accountability of the government with its macroeconomic stability, as 
well  as,  the  relevance  of  this  policy  to  halt  this  worry.  Second,  financial  openness 
showed  significant  results  in  both  dynamic  panel  data  approaches  for  all  the  three 
agencies.  Especially  for  S&P  and  Fitch,  this  variable  has  a  stronger  effect  on  its  bond 
default  assessment,  since  a  one-point  increase  is  capable  to  improve  their  sovereign 
ratings  between  one  and  three  notches.  These  results  should  be  expected  mainly  for 
developing  countries,  once  a  more  open  capital  account  brings  liquidity  and  helps  the 
government  to  fulfill  its  obligations.  Third,  exchange  rate  stability  showed  more 
significant  results  for  S&P,  although  it  exhibits  the  expected  signal  in  6  of  9 
estimations,  i.e.,  a  more  stable  exchange  rate  raises  the  sovereign  credit  ratings. 
Although the stability of exchange rate variable has never been used in the literature, the 
result regarding its significance is opposed to the studies that used the real exchange rate 
as  independent  variable  (e.g.,  Bissoondoyal-Bheenick,  2005;  Erdem  and  Varli,  2014). 
Fourth,  whatever  the  method  applied  or  model  employed,  the  subprime  crisis 
deteriorated the bond ratings of all agencies. The 2008-2009 period has been marked by 
a great international financial instability and credit restrictions, which affect practically 
all the countries around the globe and forced the ratings agencies to revise their beliefs 
regarding foreign debt payments. 

interesting  results.  First,  enhance 

Concerning  our  contributions  into  the  institutional  and  governance  dimensions, 
our  estimations  also  show 
the  democratic 
accountability  seems  to  improve  the  sovereign  ratings  of  the  three  agencies,  since  all 
estimations  showed  the  negative  signal  and  in  6  of  9  estimations  this  variable  was 
significant.  This  result  demonstrates  that  credit  rating  agencies  pay  a  special  attention 
into  the  political  aspect  by  improving  the  sovereign  ratings  of  more  democratic 
countries.  This  outcome  goes  in  opposite  direction  to  some  studies  that  found  no 
importance of the government’s regime type into the determination of sovereign ratings 
(e.g.,  Archer,  Biglaiser  and  DeRouen,  2007).  Second,  the  obedience  to  the  law,  proxy 
here  by  the  law  and  order  index,  shows  to  be  an  important  factor  especially  for  S&P, 
although it showed mixed results for Moody’s and no significance at all in the case of 
Fitch. Even though this variable has not been used before, other studies that work with 
rule  of  law  found  significance  results  for  all  the  three  agencies  (e.g.,  Biglaiser  and 
Staats,  2012).  Still,  an  increase  in  law  and  order  raises  the  bond  ratings  in  all 
estimations.  Finally,  in  relation  to  the  governance  aspect,  our  estimations  indicate  that 
less corrupt countries receive better ratings. In both dynamic panel data estimations for 
S&P and Fitch, corruption exhibits statistical significance, albeit it does not happen for 
Moody’s estimates.

Concluding remarks 
 

Sovereign credit ratings play a very important role in order to attract international 
capital mainly for developing countries, since these ratings give valuable information to 
investors  concerning  the  probability  of  default  of  sovereign  bond  ratings.  With  this  in 
mind,  this  research  put  some  effort  to  understand  the  main  determinants  of  sovereign 
ratings of developing countries given by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch for the period 1994-
2013. We extended previous works in the literature by including new economic aspects, 
as  well  as,  new  institutional  and  governance  variables,  which  had  not  been  included 
before. These new aspects considered were the adoption of inflation targeting, the level 
of financial openness,  exchange rate stability, the degree of democratic accountability, 
law enforcement and the effects of corruption. Regarding the econometric model, it was 
employed OLS with fixed cross-country effects, as well dynamic panel data approaches.  
Our findings might shed some light to the key aspects that a developing country 
should engage or improve, in order to receive better bond ratings, and by consequence, 
attract more international capital. Regarding the basic set of macroeconomic variables, 
which is commonly used in the literature, our results exhibit evidence that GDP growth, 
per  capita  income,  inflation,  foreign  reserves  and  external  debt  are  important 
determinants of sovereign ratings of developing countries. Although the budget balance 
was  not  significant  in  four  estimations  of  Moody’s  ratings,  still,  it  was  a  relevant 
variable  in  all  estimations  of  S&P  and  Fitch.  Finally,  unemployment  showed  mixed 
results  regarding  its  significance,  but  still,  in  all  estimations  it  exhibits  the  expected 
signal.  

Concerning  the  variables  that  are  our  main  contribution  into  the  economic 
dimension, the adoption of inflation targeting disclosed to  be a very  relevant  aspect  in 
the sovereign bond default assessment of the three main agencies. The adoption of this 
policy  framework  shows  to  be  able  to  enhance  the  bond  ratings  virtually  between  one 
and a half and half of a notch (Moody’s and S&P SGMM estimations respectively). The 
level  of financial openness  was also  an important  variable in  both  dynamic panel  data 
approaches for all the three agencies. Especially for S&P and Fitch, this variable has a 
stronger effect  on its bond default assessment, since a one-point increase is  capable to 
improve their sovereign  ratings between one and three notches.  Finally,  exchange rate 
stability  showed  more  significant  results  for  S&P,  although  it  exhibit  the  expected 
signal in 6 of 9 estimations.  

Regarding our contributions into the institutional and governance dimension, our 
estimations also show promising results. The increase of the democratic accountability 
improves the sovereign ratings of the three agencies. This result demonstrates that credit 
rating  agencies  pay  a  special  attention  into  the  political  aspect  by  improving  the 
sovereign ratings of more democratic countries. Furthermore, the obedience to the law 
shows  to  be  an  important  factor  especially  for  S&P,  although  it  showed  mixed  results 
for Moody’s and no significance at all in the case of Fitch. Still, an increase in the rule 
of  law  raises  the  bond  ratings  in  all  estimations.  Finally,  in  relation  to  the  governance 
aspect,  in  all estimations the corruption variable had the expected negative signal,  i.e., 
less corrupt countries receive better ratings. In both dynamic panel data, estimations for 
S&P and Fitch ratings corruption exhibited significance, albeit this not happened in the 
Moody’s estimations.

Risk points for the central government budget balance as a percentage of GDP; the estimated central 
government budget balance for a given year in the national currency is expressed as a percentage of 
the estimated GDP for that year in the national currency. The risk points are then assigned from 0 to 
10,  with  the  highest  number  (10)  indicating  the  lowest  potential  risk  for  that  component  and  the 
lowest number (0) indicating the highest potential risk. The data was obtained from the International 
Country  Risk  Guide  (ICRG)  and  represents  the  risks  associated  with  general  government  budget 
balance. We expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient. 
Risk points for the foreign debt service as a percentage of exports of goods and services; risk points 
from 0 to 10 are assigned for the estimated foreign debt service, for a given year, converted into US 
dollars  at  the  average  exchange  rate  for  that  year,  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  sum  of  the 
estimated total exports of goods and services for that year, converted into US dollars at the average 
exchange rate for that year. Once again, the highest number (10) indicates the lowest potential risk 
for  that  component  and  the  lowest  number  (0)  indicates  the  highest  potential  risk.  The  data  was 
obtained  from  the  International  Country  Risk  Guide  (ICRG).  We  expect  a  negative  sign  for  the 
estimated coefficient. 
Per capita GDP of the country can be understood as a universal measure of economic development. 
Amounts are expressed in constant 2005 prices (US dollars). The data was obtained from the World 
Bank. We expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient. 
This variable measures the growth performances of countries, i.e., the growth rate of real GDP. The 
data  was  obtained  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IFS).  We  expect  a  negative  sign  for  the 
estimated coefficient. 
This variable refers to the annual percentage change of consumer  prices. However, due to the fact 
that high inflation rates were observed in many developing countries until the mid-1990s, we follow 
Brito and Bystedt (2010) and use the natural logarithm of inflation, transforming INFn,t into, 

INFMn,t = 100*ln(1+ INFn,t /100). 

This procedure is used in order to prevent the results from being biased by a group of countries with 
high  inflation.  The  data  was  obtained  from  the  World  Bank.  We  expect  a  positive  sign  for  the 
estimated coefficient. 
This  variable  corresponds  to  the  rate  of  unemployment.  High  unemployment  rates  are  associated 
with the occurrence of social conflicts, and pressures on the fiscal side, which, in turn, can reduce 
the  government's  ability  to  pay  its  debts.  The  data  was  obtained  from  the  International  Monetary 
Fund (WEO). We expect a positive sign for the estimated coefficient. 
In order to measure exchange rate stability, we use the index of exchange rate stability, (Aizenman, 
Chinn and Ito, 2010). The index is available in: http://web.pdx.edu/~ito/trilemma_indexes.htm. We 
expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient. 
In order to measure financial openness, we use the index of capital account openness, (Aizenman, 
Chinn and Ito, 2010). The index is available in: http://web.pdx.edu/~ito/trilemma_indexes.htm. We 
expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient.  
Democratic  accountability  was  obtained  from  International  Country  Risk  Guide  (ICRG).  This  is  a 
measure of, not just whether there are free and fair elections, but how responsive government is to 
its  people.  The  less  responsive  it  is,  the  more  likely  it  will  fall.  Even  democratically  elected 
governments can delude themselves into thinking they know what is best for the people, regardless 
of clear indications to the contrary from the people. The highest number of risk points (lowest risk) 
is  assigned  to  alternating  democracies,  while  the  lowest  number  of  risk  points  (highest  risk)  is 
assigned to autarchies. We expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient. 
Law and order was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). The variable “Law and 
Order”  form  a  single  component,  but  its  two  elements  are  assessed  separately,  with  each  element 
being scored from zero to three points. To assess the “Law” element, the strength and impartiality of 
the legal system are considered, while the “Order” element is an assessment of popular observance 
of the law. It ranks nations on a scale from 0 to 6. A score of 0 represents a low level of Law and 
Order, while 6 indicates maximum level. We expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient. 
In  order  to  capture  the  effect  from  the  subprime  mortgage  crisis,  we  included  a  dummy  variable, 
which assumes value 1 for the period from 2008 to 2009, and zero otherwise.  We expect a positive 
sign for the estimated coefficient. 
We  use  data  on  corruption  from  International  Country  Risk  Guide’s  (ICRG)  corruption  index 
compiled  by  Political  Risk  Services  (PRS).  The  index  indicates  the  opinion  of  analysts  on  each 
country  regarding  the  extent  to  which  high  government  officials  are  likely  to  demand  special 
payments,  and  illegal  payments  generally  expected  throughout  lower  levels  of  government  in  the 
form of bribes connected with import and export licenses, exchange controls, tax assessment, policy 
protection,  or  loans.  It  ranks  nations  on  a  scale  from  0  to  6.  A  score  of  0  represents  maximum 
corruption  level,  while  6  indicates  minimum  corruption  level.  We  expect  a  negative  sign  for  the 
estimated coefficient.

The exchange rate expressed in US dollars enters in the estimates as an instrumental variable. The 
data was obtained from the International Monetary Fund (IFS). 
This  variable  was  obtained  from  International  Country  Risk  Guide  (ICRG).  The  variable  is  a 
measure  of  political  violence  in  the  country  and  its  actual  or  potential  impact  on  governance.  The 
risk rating assigned is the sum of three subcomponents: Civil War/Coup Threat, Terrorism/Political 
Violence, and Civil Disorder. It enters in the estimates as an instrumental variable. 
This  variable  was  obtained  from  International  Country  Risk  Guide  (ICRG).  The  variable  is  a 
measure of both the risk to the incumbent government from foreign action, ranging from non-violent 
external  pressure  (diplomatic  pressures,  withholding  of  aid,  trade  restrictions,  territorial  disputes, 
sanctions,  etc)  to  violent  external  pressure  (cross-border  conflicts  to  all-out  war).  The  risk  rating 
assigned is the sum of three subcomponents: War, Cross-Border Conflict, and Foreign Pressures. It 
enters in the estimates as an instrumental variable.  
This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). The variable gives high 
points  to  countries  where  the  bureaucracy  has  the  strength  and  expertise  to  govern  without  drastic 
changes  in  policy  or  interruptions  in  government  services.  In  these  low-risk  countries,  the 
bureaucracy  tends  to  be  somewhat  autonomous  from  political  pressure  and  to  have  an  established 
mechanism  for  recruitment  and  training.  Countries  that  lack  the  cushioning  effect  of  a  strong 
bureaucracy  receive  low  points  because  a  change  in  government  tends  to  be  traumatic  in  terms  of 
policy  formulation  and  day-to-day  administrative  functions.  It  enters  in  the  estimates  as  an 
instrumental variable.  
This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). This measure considers 
factors  affecting  the  risk  to  investment  that  are  not  covered  by  other  political,  economic  and 
financial  risk  components.  The  risk  rating  assigned  is  the  sum  of  three  subcomponents  (Contract 
Viability/Expropriation, Profits Repatriation, and Payment Delays), each with a maximum score of 
four points and a minimum score of 0 points. A score of 4 points equates to Very Low Risk and a 
score of 0 points to Very High Risk. 
This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). This is a measure of the 
military’s  involvement  in  politics.  Since  the  military  is  not  elected,  involvement,  even  at  a 
peripheral  level,  diminishes  democratic  accountability.  Military  involvement  might  stem  from  an 
external  or  internal  threat,  be  symptomatic  of  underlying  difficulties,  or  be  a  full-scale  military 
takeover.  Over  the  long  term,  a  system  of  military  government  will  almost  certainly  diminish 
effective governmental functioning, become corrupt, and create an uneasy environment for foreign 
businesses. Overall, lower risk ratings indicate a greater degree of military participation in politics 
and a higher level of political risk. 
In  order  to  measure  the  degree  of  monetary  independence,  we  use  the  index  developed  by 
Aizenman, 
in:

This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). This is a measure of the 
socioeconomic  pressures  at  work  in  society  that  could  constrain  government  action  or  fuel  social 
dissatisfaction.  The  risk  rating  assigned  is  the  sum  of  three  subcomponents:  Unemployment, 
Consumer Confidence, and Poverty. 
This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG).  A measure of religious 
tensions arising from the domination of society and/or governance by a single religious group or a 
desire to dominate in a way that replaces civil law by religious law, excludes other religions from 
the political/social processes, suppresses religious freedom or expressions of religious identity. The 
risks  involved  range  from  inexperienced  people  imposing  inappropriate  policies  to  civil  dissent  or 
civil war. 
This  variable  was  obtained  from  International  Country  Risk  Guide  (ICRG).  A  measure  of  both  of 
the  government’s  ability  to  carry  out  its  declared  program(s),  and  its  ability  to  stay  in  office.  The 
risk  rating  assigned  is  the  sum  of  three  subcomponents:  Government  Unity,  Legislative  Strength, 
and Popular Support. 

ETHNIC 
TENSIONS 

This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). A measure of the degree 
of tension attributable to racial, national, or language divisions. Lower ratings (higher risk) are given 
to  countries  where  tensions  are  high  because  opposing  groups  are  intolerant  and  unwilling  to 
compromise.
