Abstract 
This  paper  introduces  and  applies  a  new  methodology  to  deal  with  competition  among  exporters  of 
vertically differentiated products and to address the following questions: Considering product markets are 
segmented, to what extent have developed countries been losing market shares in international trade to 
non-developed countries, the South, or to other developed countries, the North? And to what extent has 
China  been  gaining  market  share  from  the  North  and  the  South?  Imports  of  manufactured  goods  from 
Japan at the most detailed level of classification are used to answer these questions. 
 
Resumo 
Este artigo introduz e aplica uma nova metodologia para lidar com a competição entre exportadores de 
produtos diferenciados verticalmente e responder as seguintes questões: considerando que os mercados de 
produtos  são  segmentados,  em  que  medida  os  países  desenvolvidos  vêm  perdendo  participação  no 
comércio internacional para os países em desenvolvimento, o Sul, ou para outros países desenvolvidos, o 
Norte? E em que medida a China vem ganhando participação do Norte e do Sul? Importações de bens

Export Quality and the Dynamics of North-South Competition 
 

In  the  past  two  decades  (1991-2011),  the  share  of  developed  economies  in  world  merchandise 
trade  fell  approximately  20  percentage  points  (p.p.) 1 .  Export  revenue  of  the  North,  as  developed 
economies are often referred to in the literature, was down to slightly over half of world export revenues 
(53%)  in  2011.  Considering  all  countries,  the  North’s  loss  corresponds  to  the  South’s  gain  of  market 
share. The share of developed economies major exporters of manufactured goods fell even more, 22 p.p. 
in the same period. The G-7 (the US, Germany, Japan, France, the UK, Italy, and Canada) accounted for 
91% of the loss of market share of developed countries major exporters of manufactured goods. The main 
gainers in the South were emerging economies led by China, which accounted for over 42% of the South 
gains in world exports, Russia, India, Mexico, Vietnam, Brazil, Thailand and Turkey. 

As the South expanded its share in world exports, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s, empirical 
research documented a new pattern of trade specialization. Large economies of the South export roughly 
the same range of products as the North, but specialize in lower-price varieties of each of these products, 
while  high-income  countries  specialize  in  higher-price  varieties  (Schott,  2004;  and  Hummels  and 
Klenow, 2005). 

This new pattern of trade specialization raises important theoretical and empirical issues. Schott 
(2004), for example, provides strong evidence that this vertically differentiated pattern of specialization 
within  products  can  largely  be  explained  by  the  traditional  factor  proportion  argument  that  the  North 
exports high-unit-value varieties, which are intensive in the region’s abundant capital and skills, while the 
South exports low-unit-value varieties, which are intensive in the region’s abundant unskilled labour2. 

Bearing  in  mind  the  evidence  of  large  differences  in  prices  observed  between  varieties  within 
products  defined  at  the  most  detailed  level  of  classification,  an  interesting  empirical  issue  is  to  what 
extent exports from the North enter into direct competition with exports from the South. Fontagné et al. 
(2008, p.54) suggest that they do not. Therefore, high-income countries would not have to worry so much 
about the South’s rising share in world trade, as long as they kept their share in an expanding upmarket 
segment. Without direct competition from the South, exports of high-price product varieties would sustain 
employment and relative wages of skilled labour in the North.  

Fontagné et all (2008) also argue that Western Europe has been more resilient to competition from 
the South than the US economy, just by examining their changes in market shares by segments between 
1995 and 2004. The North as a whole can only gains from or lose to the South. However, a country or a 
particular region in the North, such as Western Europe, may lose market share to the South as well as to 
other Northern countries. A reduction in the market share of Western Europe does not say whether the 
region is losing to the South or to other groups of countries in the North.  

The main objective of this article is to estimate the changes of market share of major exporting 
countries  or  groups  of  countries  of  the  North  and  the  South  in  the  past  two  decades,  due  to  direct 
competition, and uncover to whom each exporter of the North is losing market share on each segmented 
product market. In addition to finding out whether the North is losing market share in the lower or upper 
segments of the market, we shall be able to say if North America, for example, is losing market share to 
developed  countries  of  Western  Europe  or  Asia,  or  to  China  and  other  developing  countries,  through 
direct competition. 

To achieve this objective, we pioneeringly combine two existing methods. First, we segment the 
import value of each product into three categories: low, medium and high segments, as in Fontagné et al 
(2008). Then we apply a method of distributing the gains and losses of each exporting country to each of 
its  competitors  in  each  product  market,  as  in  Chami  Batista  (2008).  This  latter  method  allows  us  to 
estimate,  for  instance,  how  much  a  Northern  country  or  region  gained  or  lost  to  other  Northern  or 
Southern countries or regions in a particular period.

2 The main contrast with the traditional factor argument is that specialization takes place within products rather than within 
industries.(cid:1)

The combination of the two methods allows us to measure to what extent exports from the North 
are in direct competition with exports from the South in different segments of the market and to test the 
resilience of countries or regions of the North to South competition. It also allows us to test the sensitivity 
of our results to changes in a particular parameter of the segmentation method that affects the size of each 
segment,  helping  us  to  identify  where  product  varieties  of  the  North  and  the  South  enter  into  direct 
competition. 

Chami  Batista  (2010)  shows  that  his  method  of  distributing  exporters’  gains  and  losses  among 
competitors is consistent with the main theoretical models of competition. However, the method requires 
that  product  markets  are  defined  in  such  a  way  that  the  varieties  exported  by  each  exporting  country 
directly compete with or are substitutes of the varieties of all the other exporting countries in each product 
market. These are the relevant product-variety markets. By computing the distribution of gains and losses 
of each exporter among competitors with different degrees of product market segmentation, the combined 
methods help to identify the relevant segmented product markets, thus improving both of them. 

We  also  test  the  two  ways  of  calculating  the  gains  and  losses  of  market  share  due  to  direct 

competition, using Laspeyres and Paasche indices, to provide more robust results. 

In  addition  to  this  introduction,  the  article  is  organized  in  three  parts.  Part  I  provides  the 
theoretical framework, main concepts, and methodology. It is divided in four sections as follows. Section 
I.1  briefly  reviews  the  literature  on  North-South  models  of  trade  and  growth  based  on  vertical 
differentiation. Section I.2 presents the main concepts used in the article such as relevant product markets 
and direct and indirect product competition. Section I.3 describes the segmentation method. Section I.4 
describes the Constant Market Share Model (CMS) and the method of distributing the gains and losses of 
market share of countries of the North and the South, due to direct competition, among their competitors. 
Part II reports the empirical results and is divided in four sections. Section II.1 applies the segmentation 
method and reports the changes in market shares and the revealed comparative advantages of the North 
and the South in each segment and without any segmentation. Section II.2 presents the results of the CMS 
model and the effect of segmentation on the direct competition. Section II.3 shows the gains and losses of 
the main regions of the North to the South and among themselves. Section II.4 examines the gains and 
losses of China to the main groups of countries of both the North and the South. Part III concludes. 

 

I. Theoretical framework, main concepts and methodology(cid:1)
I.1 North-South models with vertically differentiated products 

Theoretically, North-South models based on specialization in vertically differentiated products has 
a  long  tradition 3,  and  the  quality  ladder  family  of  endogenous  growth  models  seems  to  capture  the 
fundamental  characteristics  of  the  recent  North-South  trade  competition  between  varieties  within 
products: The North innovates by improving the quality of its product varieties, while the South imitates 
and receives investment from Northern firms to produce product varieties first invented in the North4. The 
trade models that emphasize product horizontal differentiation and  economies of scale (as for instance, 
Krugman,  1979)  appear  to  be  more  relevant  to  explain  trade  and  growth  performances  of  individual 
countries with different sizes within either the North or the South.  

Quality  ladder  models  traditionally  make  the  simplifying  assumption  that  there  is  perfect 
substitution between the vertically differentiated varieties within a product, so that the firm producing the 
variety with the lowest quality-adjusted price5 will price out all competitors and become the sole producer 
and exporter of the product. However, vertically differentiated varieties within a product may be weakly 
substitutable or not substitutable at all, once we drop the assumptions that quality is unidimensional6 and 
consumers  are  homogeneous.  In  fact,  varieties  may  have  different  qualities  and  features  (durability, 
(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)
3 See the pioneer works of Linder (1961) and Vernon (1966). 
4 Grossman and Helpman (1991) set up a North-South model that includes innovation and imitation, while the model 
developed by Glass and Saggi (2002) also includes foreign direct investment of high-wage countries into low-wage countries. 
5 Innovation in quality ladder models can be modeled as a quality improvement as well as a cost reduction. In the first case, 
quality rises while price remains constant, in the second quality remains constant while price is reduced. In any case, the 
quality-adjusted price falls and the innovator becomes more competitive.(cid:1)
6 Unidimensional means that quality can be measured in just one axis and there is no horizontal differentiation at all within 
vertically differentiated varieties.

design, mobility, functionality etc.), consumers may have different income levels (Fajgelbaum, Grossman 
and Helpman, 2009), and heterogeneous firms may have different preferences regarding their purchases 
of  intermediate  and  capital  goods.  Heterogeneous  consumers  may  value  different  qualities  differently 
(Glass, 2001) and thus come up with very different quality-adjusted prices for each variety in the market. 

 

I.2. Relevant product markets and direct versus indirect competition 

It has been well documented that countries export different varieties of the same product at very 
different prices7 (Schott, 2004). It has also been well documented that higher per capita income countries 
tend  to  export  varieties  of  high  unit  values,  while  lower  per  capita  income  countries  tend  to  export 
varieties of low unit values (Schott, 2004; Hummels and Klenow, 2005). 

Therefore,  countries  at  different  levels  of  development  that  sell  different  varieties  of  the  same 
product may not be in direct competition, since they may be operating in different market segments. A car 
that sells for $20k can hardly be a substitute for one that sells at $100k. The buyer of the cheaper (more 
expensive)  car  is  unlikely  to  buy  the  more  expensive  (cheaper)  one  because  of  a  10  or  20  per  cent 
discount.  

As  pointed  out  by  Fontagné  et  al.  (2008),  if  countries  like  China  and  Germany  sell  the  same 
products,  according  to  available  classifications  at  the  most  disaggregated  level,  but  are  specialized  in 
different  segments  of  each  product  market,  they  may  not  be  in  direct  competition.  As  a  result  of  little 
direct competition between countries in the North and the South, they argue that there will be only a weak 
link between trade and factor prices. 

Fontagné et al. (2008) propose a method to segment each product market in three different levels 
(low, medium, high) based on relative unit values of the exporting countries8. They then show that the 
similarity  indices  between  higher  and  lower  income  countries  are  much  smaller  when  products  are 
segmented than otherwise. Applying their segmentation method and comparing the export market share 
of  each  main  country/region,  they  conclude  that  Western  Europe  has  been  more  resilient  than  other 
developed countries to competition from the South. 

Two exporters are in direct competition when they export varieties of a product that are substitutes 
to  each  other.    The  varieties  that  are  substitutes  define  the  relevant  product  market.  If  an  exporting 
country gains market (micro) share in a relevant product market, it does through direct competition with 
other exporting countries. 

A country gains market (macro) share through indirect competition when its micro shares do not 
change (no gains or losses in the relevant product markets), but its total market share rises or falls. This 
occurs  when  the  size  of  the  product  markets  in  which  the  country  has  higher/lower  shares  increase 
relatively to the other product markets. Suppose that one country exports to two relevant product markets 
A and B. Assume that it has 10% of A, 2% of B, and 3% of the two markets together, because market B is 
larger than market A. Suppose now that, after some time, market A grows to become as large as B and the 
country maintains the same share in both product markets. As a result, the overall share of the country 
will rise from 3% to say 6%, although it did not gain market share through direct competition in any of 
the two markets. It gained through indirect competition. 

Constant  Market  Share  Models  (CMS)  split  changes  in  overall  (macro)  market  share  into  two 
components:  the  competitiveness  effect  or  the  direct  competition  component;  and  the  product 
composition effect or the indirect competition component. 

 
I.3. Segmentation method 
In order to segment each product market we apply the same method as in Fontagné et al. (2008). 
Each product market at the 9-digit level of Japan’s HS classification is divided into three segments: low, 
medium and high, according to the relative unit value of the variety exported by each country. 

(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)
7 In fact, as prices are not directly observable in international trade statistics, empirical work use unit values, defined as the 
ratio of the export value to quantities, as a substitute for prices. 
8 The segmentation method will be presented in Part II of this article.(cid:1)

Since  the  method  allocates  each  country’s  export  revenue  of  each  product  into  two  different 
segments, it recognizes that each unit value represents the weighted average of some firms’ export prices, 
a
during  the  course  of  one  year,  that  are  likely  to  be  dispersed  around  that  average.  The  parameter 
 
regulates the smoothness of the market segment allocation function. Fontagné et al. (2008) sets it equal to 
four so as to make each segment equal to one third of world trade. We see no reason why to do the same 
with Japan’s imports. Furthermore, it should be recalled that Fontagné et al. (2008) uses data at the 6-digit 
level of classification. Since segmentation is very sensitive to the data level of aggregation and our study 
uses a more detailed level of classification, a specific criterion should be found to justify the value of the 
alpha parameter. 

, the whole flow is ascribed to the medium range.  

 

I.4. The CMS model and the distribution of market share changes 

The basic Constant Market Share (CMS) model breaks down the change in the aggregated market 
share  (or  macro  share)  of  a  particular  exporter  into  two  main  components:  the  direct  competition,  or 
competitiveness effect, and the indirect competition, or the product composition effect. 

The micro share of country H in country L’s imports of product i in year t is defined as: aHLi (t) (cid:1) 
XHLi(t) /MLi(t), where XHLi is country H’s exports of product i to country L and M is country L’s imports 
of product i. Assuming there are n products, we may define the row vector of dimension n as: 
aHL (cid:1) (aHL1, ... aHLi, ..., aHLn). 
The macro share of country H in country L’s imports in year t is: 
AHL(t) (cid:1) (cid:2)i XHLi(t)/ (cid:2)i MLi(t).  
The macro share change of exporting country H to importing country L in the period between year 0 to 
year t ((cid:3)AHL) may be written as: 
(cid:3)AHL (cid:1) AHL(t)-AHL(0) 
where AHL(t) is the inner product of the vector of H’s micro shares (aHL) and the vector of product shares 
of country L (bL) in year t. 
AHL(t) (cid:1) aHL(t)bL(t) 
where bL is the column vector of dimension m: bL (cid:1) (bL1, …,bLi,...,bLm) and bLi (cid:1) MLi(t)/ (cid:2)i MLi(t). 

(1) 

(2) 

Combining identities (1) and (2), we have: 

(cid:3)AHL (cid:1) aHL(t)bL(t)-aHL(0)bL(0) 
and, 
(cid:3)AHL (cid:1) [ aHL(t)-aHL(0)] bL(0)+aHL(t)[ bL(t)- bL(0)] 
where  the  two  terms  on  the  right  hand  side  of  the  identity  are  the  direct  and  the  indirect  competition 
components  of  the  macro  share  change  of  exporting  country  H  to  importing  country  L  in  the  period 
between year 0 to year t. 
Identity (4) may also be written as: 
(cid:3)AHL (cid:1) [ aHL(t)-aHL(0)] bL(t)+aHL(0)[ bL(t)- bL(0)] 

Therefore, the direct competition component of the macro share change may be calculated in two 
different ways, one using initial-year weights (a Laspeyres index) as in identity (4), and the other using 
end-year weights (Paasche index) as in identity (5). 

(4) 

(5) 

(3) 

The method of distribution of market share changes due to direct competition in international trade 
was developed in Chami Batista (2008) and its theoretical foundations were discussed in Chami Batista 

(cid:1)

’(cid:1)

(2010). The method starts with the micro share change of exporting country H in importing country L of 
commodity i in the period from year 0 to year t. We drop the superscripts L and i to ease the notation: 
(cid:3)aH (t) (cid:1) (cid:2)J(cid:4)H (cid:3)aHJ(t) (cid:1) (cid:2)J(cid:4)H [(cid:3)aHaJ(t)-(cid:3)aJaH(t)] 
where J represents all countries competing with H in the i market and (cid:3)aHJ is defined as the part of the 
micro share change of H that is ascribed to the micro share change of J. It is assumed that the varieties 
supplied by country H and countries J in the product market i are substitutable to each other. As a result 
of identity (6), the sum of country H’s gains and losses to all competing countries J is identical to country 
H’s net gain or loss. In addition to that, Chami Batista (2008) assumes that: 
(cid:3)aHJ  = (cid:3)aH aJ - (cid:3)aJ aH  = aH aJ ((cid:3)aH/aH- (cid:3)aJ/aJ) 
so that  (cid:3)aHH = 0 (country H does not gain or lose market share to itself) and (cid:3)aHJ =- (cid:3)aJH (country H’s 
gain from country J is equal to the loss of country J to country H). Summing up equation (7) across all 
relevant  markets  i,  we  find  the  net  gain  or  loss  of  exporting  country  H  to  exporting  country  J  in  the 
importing country L in the period from 0 to t.

II. Empirics 

This  study  uses  annual  data  on  Japanese  imports  of  manufactured  products9.  There  were  6108 
manufactured products at the 9-digit level of the harmonized System (HS) in 201010. The nine-digit HS 
was  introduced  in  1988  and  revised  in  1992,  1996,  2002  and  2007.  To  trace  each  product  category 
consistently  through  time,  we  use  the  initial  and  end-year  data  of  five  sub-periods:  1988-1991,  1992-
1995, 1996-2001, 2002–2006 and 2007-2010. 

As a result, we have a much longer time period of analysis (1988-2010) and a much more detailed 
product  classification  (the  9-digit  level  of  the  Harmonized  System)  than  the  period  (1994-2005)  and 
product disaggregation (6-digit level) used by Fontagné et al (2008). 

Our  data  also  differs  from  Fontagné’s,  because  it  focuses  only  on  Japan  imports  rather  than  on 
world imports. Although we obviously lose in coverage, there are some advantages in focusing on Japan 
only11:  (i)  since  richer  countries  import  more  from  countries  that  produce  higher  quality  products12, 
differences  in  demand  for  quality  across  countries  are  removed  when  only  one  importing  country  is 
considered; (ii) Japan is one of the largest trading partner of China, North America and Western Europe; 
and (iii) Japan does not have trade agreements with none of these trading partners13. 

Countries are classified by region and income levels, according to the World Bank classification, 
and are reported in the Appendix. According to their income levels, countries are classified in ascending 
order  as  Low,  Lower  Middle,  Upper  Middle,  and  High.  Countries  are  part  of  the  North  if  they  are 
classified as High and are otherwise part of the South. Because relative unit values are related to the level 
of development and we are interested in the dynamics of such a relation, we allow countries to change 
their classification according to their per capita income between different sub-periods. Within each sub-
period, countries are classified at the initial year. 
 
II.1 Market shares and trade specialization of the North and the South 

The top part of Table (1) shows that, without any segmentation, the share of the North in Japan’s 
imports of manufactured goods declined drastically from 1988 to 2010, losing 25 percentage points (p.p.), 
despite the fact that some countries moved up from the South to the North in the period14. The share of 
the North  falls in  every  sub-period  analysed in this work and is smaller  than the share of the South in 
2010.  

The shares of developed North America (NA) and Western Europe (WE) increase from 1988 to 
1991, but fall significantly from 1991 to 2010. NA loses 17 p.p. from 1988 to 2010 and WE loses 8 p.p.

in  the  same  period.    The  share  of  WE  has  become  larger  than  the  share  of  NA  since  at  least  2006. 
Therefore, the share of WE has generally been more resilient to competition in Japan than the share of 
NA. 

The share of developed Asia goes up 4 p.p. from 1988 to 2010, but this is due exclusively to South 
Korea entering the developed group in 1995/96. Without South Korea, the share of developed Asia would 
have declined 1.6 p.p. in the period. The share of South Korea also falls 1.3 p.p. from 1988 to 2010. 

As the North’s share falls, the share of the South rises from 28% in 1988 to 55% in 2010. The 
main driver of the rising share of the South has been the consistent and robust increase in China’s market 
share  during  the  whole  period  of  1988-2010.  Excluding  South  Korea  from  the  South,  the  Rest  of 
developing Asia (RoA) also gains market share in the period. It is worth noting that the share of all other 
non-developed countries taken together falls in the period. 

Before segmenting the product markets, we tested the segmentation of both Japan’s total imports 
of  manufactured  goods  and  of  a  quite  homogeneous  product  for  setting  a  reasonable  range  of  possible 
values for alpha. Chami Batista and Silveira (2010) show that the unit values of internationally traded tin 
behave in a manner very close to what is theoretically expected from a homogeneous product. They use 
monthly data on unit values from imports of the US and Japan at the most detailed level of classification 
available in each country15.  

Table (2) reports the size of the medium segment for Japan’s imports of manufactured goods for 
Japan’s imports of tin for different years in the period 1988-2010 and for different values of alpha. The 
smaller is the alpha value, the larger is the size of the medium segment. We would like to choose a range 
of values for alpha such that the size of the medium segment is significantly smaller than half of Japan’s 
imports of manufactured goods, in order to  capture a scenario in which  Japan’s import market is quite 
segmented.  After  all,  we  want  to  estimate  the  effects  of  direct  competition  among  exporters  under  the 
hypothesis that product markets are segmented. But we would also like to choose a value for alpha such 
that a high percentage of the import value of tin is allocated to the medium segment, in order to reflect the 
high degree of homogeneity of the product. 

As  Tables  (2)  reveals,  for  alpha  smaller  than  3  the  medium  segment  of  Japan’s  imports  of 
manufactured  goods  would  not  allow  much  segmentation,  and  for  alpha  greater  than  5  the  medium 
segment of tin would be too small for a quasi-homogeneous good. We conclude that a range between 3 
and 5 for alpha is quite appropriate for our sensitivity tests. 

When Japan’s import market of manufactured goods is segmented16, it is possible to observe on 
the bottom part of Table (1) that the North suffers dramatic losses in the low and medium segments in the 
1988-2010  period  and  in  each  and  every  sub-period.  This  is  a  clear  evidence  of  the  fierce  price 
competition from the South with which the North was confronted in these segments during this period. In 
the early period of 1988-91, the North makes some gains in the high segment, but that is not enough to 
offset the losses in the low and medium segments.  In all the other sub-periods from 1992 to 2010, the 
share of the North falls in the high segment17. 

Based on this surprising evidence and on North-South growth models, one could say that, during 
this period, the rate of quality improvement applied to products produced in the North was lower than the 
rate  applied  to  products  produced  in  the  South  through  imitation  and  knowledge  transferred  from 
Northern firms. 

China’s  market  share  gains  take  place  largely  in  the  low  and  medium  segments.  In  the  low 
segment, China’s share jumps from 9.8% in 1988 to reach a staggering 52% in 2006, remaining stable 
after  that.  In  the  medium  segment,  the  rise  is  continuous  from  4.5%  in  1988  to  42%  in  2010.  China’s 
share  in  the  high  segment  was  about  1%  from  1988  to  1996.  After  that,  it  rose  continuously,  and  at  a 
faster rate than China’s shares in the other two segments, to reach 6.2% in 2010. The Rest of Asia, formed

15 In the US tin is classified as HS 800110.0000 and in Japan is HS 800110.000.  
16 The figures presented in the analysis by segment are calculated with alpha equal to 4. Changing the parameter alpha of the 
segmentation method to 3 raises the relative size of the medium segment, while changing it to 5 does the opposite. However, 
the impact is quite small and has little effect on the dynamics described in this section. 
17 In fact, the share of the North rises between 1995 and 1996 (not shown), but this is exclusively due to South Korea leaving 
the South and joining the developed North.(cid:1)

by developing Asia countries other than China (RoA), also shows significant gains in market share in all 
segments in the period 1988-2010, once South Korea is excluded. 

Given that South Korea is one of the few examples of a developing country that has moved up to 
become a high-income economy, it is interesting to look into her changing shares by segment. Her share 
in  the  low  segment  suffers  a  drastic  fall,  much  like  other  developed  countries  of  Asia,  and  in  sharp 
contrast with China and the RoA. However, in the high segment, South Korea does not show a definite 
trend in her market share, showing some ups and downs. This is again in contrast with China and the RoA 
in the South and also with developed Asia, as the shares of all these parts of Asia reveal a clear upward 
trend in the high segment. South Korea seems to be positioned somewhere in between the performance of 
the developed countries of the western world and the performance of other countries of Asia. 

  The group of countries of the South classified as others show a fall in their market share in all 
segments and periods, except in the high segment between 1995 and 2010, when it shows a rising trend. It 
appears that these countries have been forced to improve the quality of their manufactured products and 
compete in the upper market segment, given their difficulties in facing the price competition of China and 
other non-developed Asian countries in the low and medium segments. 

Considering  that  the  North  still  maintains  30%  of  the  low  segment  in  2010,  the  South  can  still 
make  further  gains.  Low-income  countries  like  Cambodia  (L)  and  Bangladesh  (L)  and  low-middle-
income countries like Vietnam (LM), Indonesia (LM) and the Philippines (LM), among others, have some 
potential to increase their market share. On the other hand, China appears to face difficulties in further 
raising her share in the low segment, having moved up from a low-income (L) in 1988 to a lower-middle-
income in 1997 and to an upper-middle-income (UM) economy in 2010. 

Table  (3)  reports  the  changes  in  the  specialization  index  (Balassa’s  revealed  comparative 
advantage)  of  the  main  groups  of  developed  and  developing  countries  during  the  period  between  1988 
and 2010. 

As  expected,  the  North  reveals  comparative  advantage  in  the  high  segment,  while  the  South 
reveals comparative advantage in the low and medium segments. More interestingly, while the North has 
become more specialized in the upper market segment, the South has reduced its revealed comparative 
advantage  (RCA)  in  the  lower  market  segment.  In  other  words,  the  losses  of  the  North  in  the  high 
segment were relatively smaller than in the low and medium segments. On the other end, the gains of the 
South in the low segment were relatively smaller than in the medium and high segments. 

Western  Europe  has  shown  RCA  in  the  high  segment  since  the  start  of  our  period  of  analysis, 
while North America, developed Asia and other developed countries have become specialized in the high 
segment during our period of analysis. Western Europe has the highest RCA in the high segment and the 
lowest in the medium segment. The RCA of North America has been similar to Western Europe’s in the 
low segment, but it has been much higher in the medium segment and much lower in the high segment18. 
Developed Asia has the highest RCA in the low segment and the lowest in the high segment among these 
three main groups of the North. 

Within the South, China is more specialized in the low segment than the Rest of Asia (RoA) and 
has become more specialized in the medium segment than the RoA within this period. On the other hand, 
China has a much lower RCA in the high segment than the RoA, though both are not specialized in the 
upper market segment. However, one can say that China is gradually rising in the quality ladder, given 
her declining RCA in the low segment and her better performance in the medium and high segments since 
the mid-1990s.  Finally, it is noteworthy that the  dynamics of the South specialization has been largely 
influenced but what happens to China. 

 

 II.2 Breaking down of the macro share changes into direct and indirect effects 

We  have  applied  identities  (4)  and  (5)  of  the  Constant  Market  Share  Model  (CMS),  which  use 
Laspeyres  and  Paasche  indices,  respectively,  to  breakdown  the  macro  share  changes  into  direct 
competition (competitiveness) and indirect competition (composition) effects. Table (4) reports the direct 

(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)
18 North America was specialized in the medium segment from 1988 to 2007. The most specialized countries in the medium 
segment tend to be large exporters of manufactured products that are intensive in natural resources, such as South Africa, 
Chile, UAE, Russia, New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, Brazil and Canada.

and indirect effects in the aggregated period of 1988-2010, without and with the segmentation of product 
markets,  assuming  alpha  equal  to  4  for  segmenting  product  markets19.  These  two  identities  were  first 
applied  to  each  sub-period  and  then  aggregated  to  sum  up  the  changes  in  the  eighteen  years  period 
between 1988 and 201020.  

We can observe that the market share losses of the North and the gains of the South due to direct 
competition are always smaller than the macro share changes, no matter if Laspeyres or Paasche indices 
are used and if markets are segmented or not. This means that the low and medium segments of Japanese 
imports  of  manufactures,  in  which  the  South  is  more  specialized,  were  more  dynamic  than  the  high 
segment, making the indirect competition (or composition) effects positive for the South and negative for 
the North, hence making the South’s macro share gains and the North’s macro share losses larger than the 
direct competition effect. 

Comparing the columns of direct competition effects with segmentation and with no segmentation 
on  Table  (4),  we  can  also  conclude  that  if  relevant  product  markets  are  segmented,  assuming  no 
segmentation overestimates the direct competition effects. However, although this is true for the 18-year 
period from 1988 to 2010, it was not true for the earlier sub-periods of 1988-91 and 1992-95. 

What is true for the North and the South in aggregate does not necessarily hold for the groups that 
make up the North and  the South. Using  Laspeyres indices, the loss in the market share of NA  due to 
direct competition is much larger than Asia’s and WE’s losses with or without segmentation. WE’s loss 
due to direct competition is slightly larger than Asia’s without segmentation, but it is much smaller with 
segmentation. On the other hand, using Paasche indices and segmenting the product markets, the loss of 
NA  due  to  direct  competition  is  the  smallest  of  these  three  groups,  the  loss  of  WE  is  the  largest,  and 
Asia’s is in between. Therefore, it is not possible to say which group of developed countries has been the 
most or the least resilient to direct competition from both the North and the South together. 

As  to  the  gains  of  the  South,  Table  (4)  shows  that  China’s  gains  due  to  direct  competition  are 
smaller than her macro  share  gains and are even smaller with segmentation than without, regardless of 
whether Laspeyres or Paasche indices are used. Without segmentation and using Laspeyres indices, the 
macro share gains of RoA are due to indirect competition, since the direct competition effect is negative. 
If  product  markets  are  segmented,  the  direct  competition  effect,  based  on  Laspeyres  indices,  becomes 
positive and quite large, hence the indirect effect is highly  negative. On  the other hand, using Paasche 
indices, the direct competition effect is positive and smaller than the macro share change with or without 
segmentation. 

The  more  segmented  the  market,  that  is,  when  the  parameter  alpha  is  increased  from  zero  (no 
segmentation) to 3, 4 and 5, the losses of the North and the gains of the South and China are reduced, 
regardless  of  which  index  is  used.  However,  the  effects  of  increasing  segmentation  on  the  direct 
competition of other developed or developing countries depend on which index is used and are, therefore, 
ambiguous. 
 

III.3 North-South and North-North Direct Competition 

Table (5) sums up the direct competition gains and losses of the main groups of the North to both 
the South and the North in the period 1988-2010, using Paasche and Laspeyres indices and alpha equal to 
four for segmenting product markets.  
North-South Direct Competition 

The  North  loses  market  share  in  direct  competition  with  the  South  in  each  and  every  segment 
(low, medium and high) and in each and every sub-period from 1988 to 2010, except in the earliest sub-
period  of  1988-1991  when  it  was  still  gaining  from  the  South  in  the  high  segment.  This  quite 
extraordinary result is robust to alpha equal to 3, 4, and 5, and to Laspeyres and Paasche indices21.

19 Changing alpha to 3 or 5 does not change our conclusions in this section. 
20 Recall that the changes between 1991 and 1992, 1995 and 1996, 2001 and 2002, and 2006 and 2007 were not calculated 
because of changes in product definitions of the Harmonized System of classification at the 9-digit level in these pairs of years. 
Therefore, 1988-2010 macro market share changes exclude the changes in the above sub-periods. 
21 All statements thereafter are valid for both Paasche and Laspeyres methods and all three levels of market segmentation used 
(alpha 3, 4, and 5), unless clearly stated otherwise.  

(cid:1)

+(cid:1)

It  is  true,  however,  that  most  of  the  North’s  direct  loss  to  the  South  took  place  in  the  low  and 
medium segments, which accounted for between 80% (P5) and 86% (L3) of the total direct loss to the 
South in the period 1988-201022. 

Considering  the  average  annual  losses  of  the  North  in  each  period,  we  observe  that  the  bulk  of 
these losses took place in the sub-periods between 1992 and 2006. The average annual loss of the North 
was  much  smaller  in  the  sub-period  2007-2010  and  even  smaller  in  the  sub-period  1988-1991.  More 
interestingly, the North gained in the high segment in the earliest period (1988-1991), mitigating the large 
losses in the low and medium segments, whereas, in the latest sub-period (2007-2010), the high segment 
accounted for between 34% (P3) and 45% (L5) of the North’s direct losses to the South. This is a clear 
indication of the deteriorating capacity of the North to compete even in the upper product markets. 

The  North’s  loss  to  the  South  is  largely  due  to  the  gains  of  China  and  other  non-developed 
countries of Asia (RoA). Aggregating all segments and all sub-periods, China accounts for between 54% 
(L5) and 61% (P3) of the North’s loss to the South, while the RoA accounts for between 30% (L3) and 
32% (P5). However, again, this distribution is uneven by segments. While China accounts for between 
68%  (L3)  and  77%  (P5)  of  the  North’s  loss  to  the  South  in  the  low  segment,  she  accounts  for  only 
between 15% (L3) and 23% (P5) in the high segment. The developing countries of the RoA, on the other 
hand, accounts for between 19% (P5) and 27% (L3) of the North’s loss to the South in the low segment, 
but accounts for between 58% (L5) and 75% (P3) in the high segment23. Therefore, China has shown to 
be  very  competitive  against  the  North  in  the  lower  markets,  while  the  RoA  has  shown  to  be  quite 
competitive against the North in the upper markets. 

Developed  Asian  countries  are  the  big  losers  to  the  South,  accounting  for  half  of  the  North’s 
overall loss to the South (P3=49%; L4=50%) in the period 1988-2010. But developed Asia’s loss to the 
South is heavily concentrated in the low and medium segments, whereas NA and WE explain between 
76% (L5) and 90% (P3) of North’s losses in the high segment in this 18-year period. Although developed 
Asia is the least resilient group of the North to South competition in the 3 segments taken together, it is 
the most resilient in the high segment, regardless of whether Laspeyres or Paasche is applied. 

However, the resilience of NA and WE to direct competition from the South depends on whether 
Laspeyres or Paasche is applied. Using Laspeyres indices, WE is the group of developed countries most 
resilient  to  South  competition  in  the  3  segments  taken  together  and  in  the  low  and  medium  segments, 
followed by NA and Asia. In the high segment, WE follows Asia, as the second most resilient group of 
developed  countries  to  South  direct  competition.  Using  Paasche  indices,  on  the  other  hand,  NA  is  the 
most resilient group of developed countries in the 3 segments taken together, followed by WE and Asia. 
NA is the most resilient in the low segment, WE is the most resilient in the medium segment, and Asia is 
the most resilient in the high segment. 

Therefore, Fontagné’s, Gaulier’s and Zignago’s thesis that WE is more resilient than NA to South 
competition, considering just the effects of direct competition, cannot be confirmed for Japan’s imports. It 
should  be  stressed  that  the  methodology  of  Fontagné  et  al  (2008),  which  just  look  into  the  changes  of 
market shares by segment, is not appropriate to address the question of competition between the South 
and groups of developed countries of the North. 
North-North Competition 

Developed Asia gains market share through direct competition from all the groups of the North in 
all three segments in the period 1988-2010, regardless of the index applied and for any value of alpha in 
the  3  to  5  range.  Using  Laspeyres  index,  developed  WE  also  gains  market  share  through  direct 
competition from the North taken together and in direct competition with NA in the low, medium and 
high segments. On the other hand, using Paasche indices, WE loses market share in all the segments to all 
the regions of the North, including NA.

typically makes very little difference.

II.4 China’s Gains through direct competition 

As  seen  on  Table  (4),  China  made  substantial  overall  gains  of  market  share  through  direct 
competition in the 18-year period from 1988 to 2010. Overtime, China’s average annual gains through 
direct competition in the earliest period of 1988-1991 are 11% (for any L(cid:5) or P(cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:5)=3, 4, or 5) of the 
sum of the average annual gains of all five sub-periods, rise to between 20% (L5) and 31% (L3) in the 
three  intermediate  sub-periods,  and  fall  to  between  8%  (L5)  and  12%  (P5)  in  the  latest  sub-period  of 
2007-2010.  Therefore,  the  bulk  of  China’s  gains  take  place  in  the  three  sub-periods  between  1992  and 
2006. 

Table  (6)  reports  the  results  of  the  distribution  of  China’s  gains  and  losses,  through  direct 
competition,  among  exporting  competitors  in  the  period  1988-2010.  It  shows  that  approximately  two 
thirds of China’s total gains come from direct competition with the North and one third come from the 
South, largely from the RoA, regardless of whether Laspeyres or Paasche index is used and the applied 
degree  of  segmentation  (alpha  from  3  to  5).  Overtime,  however,  China’s  gains  from  the  South,  which 
account  for  between  55%  (P5)  and  57%  (L5)  of  the  total  in  the  earliest  sub-period  of  1988-1991  sub-
period, fall drastically in the 1990s and 2000s, and in the latest sub-period of 2007-2010 it is the North 
that account for between 82% (P5) and 100% (L5) of China’s gains. 

The  low  and  medium  segments  account  for  the  bulk  of  China’s  total  gains  in  the  period  1988-
2010, while the high segment accounts for between just 3.6% (L3) and 7.0% (P5) of them. There is not 
much difference in the importance of each segment when China’s gains from direct competition with the 
South are compared with the North. 

More telling is the evolution of China’s gains by segment overtime. In the earliest sub-period of 
1988-1991, China’s gains in the low segment accounted for between 66% (L3) and 87% (P5) of China’s 
total gain.  The share of  China’s gains in the low segment went down in  the 1990s and 2000s to  reach 
between 17% (P3) and 20% (L5) in the sub-period 2007-2010. On the other hand, the share of China’s 
gains in the medium segment went up to between 46%  (L5) to 63%  (P3) in the sub-period 2007-2010 
from  between  12%  (P5)  and  32%  (L3)  in  the  sub-period  1988-1991.  As  a  result,  the  share  of  the  high 
segment in China’s gains went up from between 1% (P3) and 3.4% (L5) in 1988-91 to between 19% (P3) 
and 37% (L5) in 2007-10. This is a clear evidence of China’s increasing capability to directly compete in 
upmarket products. 

The  gains  of  China  from  direct  competition  with  the  South,  which  accounted  for  over  half  of 
China’s total gains in the low segment in the three earliest sub-periods, went down to 30% in 2002-2006. 
In 2007-10 China lost market share in direct competition with the South in the low segment, both to the 
RoA and to the group of other developing countries. 

Therefore,  as  China’s  per  capita  income  gradually  made  its  way  up  from  low  (1988-1996)  to 
lower-middle (1997-2009), and upper-middle (2010), her gains drastically  fell in the low segment. The 
potential for new  gains in the low segment appears to be fading  away  as China begins to lose through 
direct  competition  with  other  competitors  of  the  South.  This  is  a  clear  evidence  of  China’s  immense 
difficulties in further penetrating the low-end of product markets. 

 

III. Conclusions 

The North lost market share, both in general as well as in direct and indirect competition with the 
South, in each and in all of the three segments (low, medium and high) and in each and every sub-period 
from 1988 to 2010, except in the high segment in the 1988-1991 sub-period. Considering the North-South 
models in which the North innovates, the South imitates and Northern firms can transfer technology to the 
South,  our  results  suggest  that  imitation  and  technology  transfers  to  the  South  have  been  faster  than 
innovation in the North in this period. As a result, gains in cost efficiency of firms in the South appear to 
have made the quality-adjusted prices of their product varieties more competitive than those produced by 
firms in the North in each and every segment. The South’s gains in direct competition with the North in 
each of the three segments and the possible greater technological progress of the South, for such a long 
period, are quite extraordinary phenomena, unlikely to have been observed in the post-war North-South 
trade relations.

Most of the North’s direct loss to the South took place in the low and medium segments and China 
and  other  developing  countries  of  Asia  accounted  for  most  of  the  South’s  direct  gains.  Overtime, 
however, there is a significant increase in the gains of the South in the high segment. China accounts for 
most of the South direct gains in the low segment, while the rest of developing countries of Asia accounts 
for most of the South gains in the high segment.  

The  direct  competition  gains  of  the  South  and  the  direct  competition  losses  of  the  North  are 
reduced the more segmented product markets are assumed to be in the 1988-2010 period, but the gains 
and losses of particular groups of countries in the North and South are not necessarily inversely related to 
the level of segmentation. Fontagné’s, Gaulier’s and Zignago’s thesis that WE is more resilient than NA 
to South competition, considering the effects of direct competition at the most detailed level of product 
classification, cannot be confirmed for Japan’s imports. 

Although segmentation reduces the importance of high-income countries direct competition with 
China, North-South competition accounted for the bulk of China's gains and losses. As China relative per 
capita income rose and moved from a classification of low income to lower-middle and to upper-middle 
income, China’s immense difficulties in further penetrating the low-end of product markets and China’s 
increasing capability to directly compete in upmarket products became quite evident.  

However,  to  move  into  the  club  of  high-income  countries,  China  will  have  to  keep  raising  her 
share in the segment of high price varieties at the expense of the North. Developed countries can make 
entry in the North more difficult to all upper-middle-income countries, China in particular, if they are able 
to raise their rate of innovation relatively to imitation and to the transfer of technology to the South. This 
is likely to make South-South competition fiercer in the low and medium price variety markets, as lower-
income  countries  will  try  to  increase  their  share  in  the  low  and  medium  price  variety  segments  at  the 
expense of China’s. As revealed in this paper, this has already been happening in a yet small scale.
