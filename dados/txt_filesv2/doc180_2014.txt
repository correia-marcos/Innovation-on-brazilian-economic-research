Desde o início da industrialização é possível observar um aumento dos níveis de gases de efeito estufa (GEE) 
causados  pelas  atividades  humanas.  Diante  desse  cenário,  os  problemas  em  torno  dos  GEE  e  as  mudanças 
climáticas relacionadas se tornaram relevantes pontos de debate. As discussões sobre o tema começam a ganhar 
o cenário mundial a partir do Protocolo de Quioto e estão em voga devido ao fato que o crescimento dos GEE se 
manteve,  mesmo  com  o  avanço  e  surgimento  de  políticas  climáticas.  Além  disso,  estão  em  voga  devido  à 
globalização acelerada das economias mundiais e à expansão do comércio internacional. Desta forma, o trabalho 
busca fazer uma investigação empírica sobre as responsabilidades pelas emissões e o comércio internacional para 
27 países da União Europeia e 13 países selecionados para o período de 1995 a 2009. O trabalho também permeia 
questões e discussões em torno das teorias e hipóteses ambientais que envolvem o comércio internacional. Para 
tanto, foram utilizadas matrizes de insumo-produto para 40 países mais o “restante do mundo” que abrangem o 
período  de  1995  a  2009,  provenientes  do  Projeto WIOD.  Em  termos  de  resultados,  temos  indícios  de  que  os 
decréscimos das emissões de alguns países são provenientes de uma maior interação em termos de comércio.

ABSTRACT: 

 

Since the beginning of industrialization it is possible to observe an increase in the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions caused by human activities. Given this issues, the problem  of GHG and related climate change are 
relevant points today. Discussions began to gain the attention of the world with the Kyoto Protocol and they are 
in vogue due to the fact that the growth of GHG remained, even with emergence and advancement of climate 
policies. Moreover, they are in vogue due the sudden globalization of world economies and the expansion of 
international  trade.  Thus,  this  paper  seeks  to  make  an  empirical  investigation  of  the  responsibility  for  CO2 
emissions and international trade for the 27 countries of the European Union and 13 other selected countries for 
the period of 1995-2009. This paper also permeates issues and discussions about the environmental theories and 
hypotheses involving international trade. The input-output matrices were used for 40 countries plus the “rest of 
world” for the period of 1995-2009, that comes from of the WIOD project.  In terms of results, we have evidence 
that the decrease of CO2 emissions in some countries comes from high interaction in terms of trade with other 
countries.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

According to the report of World Trade Organization (WTO, 2009), since the beginning of 
industrialization it is possible to observe an increase in the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) caused by 
human activities. As a result, the concentration of GHG in the atmosphere has also increased. Given 
this scenario, the issues around GHG and related climate change are relevant in the global economy 
discussion. 

Debates began to gain the attention of the world with the signing of the Kyoto Protocol in 
December  1997,  where  an  international  agreement  was  reached  to  reduce  global  emissions  to  the 
atmosphere  (MUNKSGAARD  and  PEDERSEN,  2001).  However,  the  growth  of  global  CO2 
emissions remained, even with the emergence and advancement of climate policies.  From 1990 to 
2008  CO2  emissions  in  developed  countries  has  stabilized,  however  emissions  in  developing 
countries doubled (PETERS et al., 2011). 

International  trade  has  expanded  in  recent  centuries  and  this  is  one  reason  why  trade  is 
increasingly being involved with discussions about climate change (WTO, 2009). According to Peters 
and Hertwich (2006), given that production networks are increasingly global, it is observed that many 
production processes occur outside the country of final consumption. 

Thus, there is a growing concern with the problem of carbon leakage and consequently many 
studies have taken into consideration the estimated emissions embodied in international trade through, 
for example, input-output analysis (e.g. WYCKOFF and ROOP, 1994; SCHAEFFER and DE SÁ, 
1996; LENZEN, 1998; MACHADO et al., 2001; MUNKSGAARD and PEDERSEN, 2001; PETERS 
and HERTWICH, 2004, 2006). 

In this context, it is important to incorporate issues involving GHG emissions and international 
trade. Moreover, the debate also involves trade liberalization and related environmental consequences 
of  economic  growth  and  international  trade  (e.g.  COPELAND  and  TAYLOR,  1994,  2004; 
NORDSTRÖM and SCOTT, 1999; DASGUPTA et al., 2002). 

Consequently,  this  paper  seeks  to  make  an  empirical  investigation  of  CO2  emissions  from 
international trade for the 27 countries of the European Union and 13 other selected countries for the 
period of 1995-2009. Furthermore, it permeates issues and discussions around environmental theories 
and  hypotheses  involving  international  trade  (e.g.  the  pollution  haven  effect,  the  pollution  haven 
hypothesis, trade’s patterns of North-South). 

The overall aim is to measure emissions embodied in international trade and to analyze the 
interactions in regional terms, among such countries. We propose the following specific aims: a) to 
observe the behavior of countries regarding CO2 emissions, if there is concentration and whether this 
behavior  is  maintained  over  the  years  1995-2009;  b)  to  measure  CO2  emissions  embodied  in 
production and consumption, c) to measure the CO2 emissions embodied in exports and imports of 
each country; d) to verify if the international trade has been used as a way to reduce emissions by 
countries,  and  e)  to  analyze  the  degree  of  economic  interaction  between  two  regions5  in  terms  of 
pollution  (CO2  emissions);  and  f)  to  evaluate  environmental  hypotheses  and  theories  about  CO2 
emissions and international trade. 

Thus, this paper seeks to contribute with the use of an interregional input-output model and 
analyze  the  economic  interactions  through  Miyazawa  multipliers.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the 
choice of the method is given by the ability to look at the interaction effect (interdependence) and the 
types of synergistic interactions among countries, and the possibility of extension for interactions in 
terms of CO2 emissions. 

In order to achieve these aims and to have a more detailed view, we use exercises to show the 
behavior of countries in terms of absolute emissions, economic interactions, and other aspects. This 
selection is made taking into account the importance of the countries in the global context and with 
respect to the discussions of international trade and CO2 emissions. 

                                                           
5The choice of regions is given by the importance of these in economic terms, applications and discussions on literature 
review of emissions and international trade.

Furthermore,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  issues  around  international  trade  refer  to  a 
discussion  of  the  intermediate  flows  among  countries,  i.e.,  only  trade  relations  in  terms  of  the 
intermediate consumption are taken into account. 

In order to contextualize the research problem and achieve these objectives, the present work 
is divided as follows: besides this introduction, the second section provides a literature review. The 
third  shows  the  database.  The  fourth  section  presents  the  methodology.  The  fifth  presents  the 
empirical results. Finally, the sixth section presents some concluding remarks. 

2. LITERATURE REVIEW  

Research  efforts  have  taken  into  account  sustainable  consumption.  However,  according  to 
Tukker et al. (2006) although it has been possible to observe some progress, real initiatives for more 
sustainable consumption have not materialized. Thus, efforts to develop more efficient and effective 
consumption systems are still unknown, with little practical advance. 

Therefore, policymakers are seeking a better understanding of how environmental impacts are 
related to  the choices and specific activities of consumption.  In addition, despite some certainties, 
Tukker et al. (2006) argue that there are many gaps unfilled, such as the environmental impacts of 
consumption in developed countries on trading partners, especially in developing countries. 

The assumption behind this, according to Wiedmann et al. (2007) is that given the growing 
demand  in  the  world  by  the  developed  countries  for  imported  goods  and  services,  we  have 
consequently increased pollution in the production process in other countries. Thus, in order to reduce 
GHG emissions it is necessary to investigate not only the major sources of emissions, but also the 
location of such emissions and the sectors involved. 

Despite all the discussion regarding GHG emissions, it is important to take into consideration 
trade and GHG emissions involved. Furthermore, it is important to consider the literature around the 
liberalization of international trade and related environmental consequences. 

The pollution embodied in trade flows becomes important due to the sudden expansion and 
globalization of world economies, where demand can be supplemented through international trade. 
Thus,  recent  studies  have  explored  and  demonstrated  that  a  significant  amount  of  pollution  is 
embodied in international trade (e.g. WYCKOFF and ROOP, 1994; LENZEN, 1998; MACHADO et 
al., 2001; LENZEN et al., 2004). 

However,  according  to  Wyckoff  and  Roop  (1994)  many  controlling  policies  are  based  on 
reducing  domestic  emissions  of  GHG,  which  ignores,  for  example,  CO2  emissions  embodied  in 
international trade. 

Moreover,  considering  international  trade,  Antweiler  (1996)  introduces  the  concept  of 
pollution in terms  of trade and approaches another important  question:  “Do countries gain  or lose 
environmentally from engaging in international trade?”  

As mentioned previously, with the process of globalization, developed countries can achieve 
their targets for reducing emissions through international trade and/or shift their emissions-intensive 
production  to  other  countries  (WYCKOFF  and  ROOP,  1994;  KONDO  et  al.  1998;  WIEBE  et  al. 
2012).Therefore, there is a growing concern with the problem of carbon leakage and consequently 
many studies have taken into consideration the estimated emissions embodied in international trade 
through  input-output  analysis  (e.g.  WYCKOFF  and  ROOP,  1994;  MUNKSGAARD  and 
PEDERSEN, 2001; WIEBE et al. 2012). 

Thus in recent years many studies have tried to develop a more comprehensive approach to 
measure  pollution  embodied  in  trade  flows,  including  contributions  that  combine  input-output 
analysis and ecological footprint6 (TURNER et al., 2007). 

However,  beyond  this  discussion,  the  debate  behind  environmental  issues  also  involves 
discussion around trade liberalization and related environmental consequences. The world economy 
is  in  continuous  change  over  the  years.  The  economic  activity,  population  and  per  capita  income 

                                                           
6 As suggested by Wiedmann et al. (2007), the ecological footprint should be estimated based on a multi-regional input-
output model. The authors argue that the method is more appropriate and accurate to allocate the total pollution.

showed  significant  changes.  Moreover,  the  world  economy  has  become  more  integrated,  e.g. 
technological advances in communication and information, the reduction of trade barriers and foreign 
investment (NORDSTRÖM e SCOTT, 1999). 

According  Nordström  and  Scott  (1999)  with  more  integrated  economies,  the  costs  of 
international trade transactions substantially reduced, leading to an increase of 14 times in the trade 
since  1950.  However,  the  evolution  and  growth  of  the  world  economy  may  be  accompanied  by 
environmental  degradation  (e.g.  global  warming,  air  pollution).  Given  this,  discussions  around 
international trade, the effects of environmental policy and the environmental consequences of trade 
liberalization have been made by the environmental community (NORDSTRÖM and SCOTT, 1999; 
COPELAND and TAYLOR, 2004). Moreover, according to Copeland and Taylor (2004) the debate 
was intensified with the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and proposals for future 
rounds of trade negotiations. 

Given this discussion around environmental issues, it has been possible to find in the literature 
many authors who address  the environmental consequences of economic growth  and international 
trade (e.g. COPELAND and TAYLOR, 1994; NORDSTRÖM and SCOTT, 1999; DASGUPTA et 
al., 2002; COPELAND and TAYLOR, 2004). 

Copeland and Taylor (2004) approach theories and empirical works to answer three questions: 
“What  do  we  know  about  the  relation  among  international  trade,  economic  growth,  and  the 
environment? How can this evidence help us evaluate ongoing policy debates in this area? Where do 
we go from here?” 

A  first  theory  approached  by  Copeland  and  Taylor  (2004)  is  known  as  the  Environmental 
Kuznets Curve (EKC). According to the authors, the EKC literature postulates a simple relationship 
between  per  capita  income  and  pollution.  Moreover,  according  to  Atweiler  et  al.  (2001)  the  main 
issue behind this theory is as follows: "How does economic growth affect the environment?” 

The EKC hypothesis is that we have a relation in the form of inverted U between per capita 
income  of  a  country,  economic  development,  and  their  level  of  environmental  quality 
(NORDSTRÖM and SCOTT, 1999; DASGUPTA et al., 2002; COPELAND and TAYLOR, 2004). 
However, Dasgupta et al. (2002) argue that the model of EKC provoked conflicting reactions 
of researchers and policymakers, and it has been possible to find at least four different approaches7. 
Besides Dasgupta et al. (2002), other authors present different results about the EKC, e.g., Chimeli 
and Braden (2005) and Chimeli (2007). 

Furthermore, despite the relevance and relation between income growth and the environment, 
Copeland and Taylor (2004) discuss the fact that trade can change the environmental results through 
a variety of other ways, such as with the displacement of pollution-intensive industries from countries 
with stringent environmental policies for those with less stringent policies. 

According  to  Atweiler  et  al.  (2001),  this  branch of  literature  seeks  to  examine  the  relation 
between  pollution  abatement  costs  and  trade  flows  and  it  seeks  to  answer  the  following  question: 
"How do environmental regulations affect trade flows?" 

According to Copeland and Taylor (2004), the literature has not always been clear about the 
hypothesis  to  be  tested.  The  authors  show  that  much  of  the  attention  has  been  directed  to  three 
hypotheses of the effect of pollution regulation on trade flows. 

The first hypothesis is that strong regulation of pollution has effects on plant location decisions 
and trade flows - pollution haven effect (COPELAND and TAYLOR, 2004). The second hypothesis, 
known as pollution haven hypothesis, according to Copeland and Taylor (2004) and Taylor (2005) is 
a stronger version of the first, because according to this hypothesis, a reduction of trade barriers will 
lead to a shifting of intensive industry from countries with stringent pollution regulations for countries 
with weaker regulations, i.e., a trade liberalization leads to a shifting of production of "dirty goods" 
from countries with stringent regulations (North) for countries with weaker regulation (South). 

Finally, the third hypothesis is that the direction of "dirty goods" trade is decided mainly by 
conventional  determinants  of  comparative  advantage  and  differences  in  technology.  In  terms  of

5 

effect, Copeland and Taylor (2004) discuss that there is no reason to expect that trade has the same 
effect in all countries, because the effect of trade liberalization on the environment depends on the 
comparative advantage of a country. 

According to Antweiler et al. (2001), a critical approach involving environmental policy, it is 
that despite being successful in predicting patterns of trade in a world where politics is fixed, their 
findings may lead to erroneous conclusions in a world where environmental protection is endogenous. 
However,  the  environmental  policy  involves  other  considerations.  Copeland  and  Taylor 
(2004) show two concerns, the first involving the use of environmental policy as a substitute for trade 
policy, and the second one that involves the use of trade policy to achieve environmental goals. 

Furthermore, Chichilnisky (1994) argues that to develop appropriate environmental policies 
is necessary to understand the connection between markets and the environment. In this context the 
author raises some questions: Why do developing countries tend to specialize in the production and 
the  export  of  goods  which  deplete  environmental  resources  such  as  rain  forests?  Do  they  have  a 
comparative  advantage  in  "dirty  industries",  and  if  so,  does  efficiency  dictate  that  this  advantage 
should be exploited? Is it  possible to  protect  resources without interfering with  free markets? Are 
trade  policies  based  on  traditional  comparative  advantages  compatible  with  environmental 
preservation? 

Besides these issues, another point is approached by Chichilnisky (1994): “How do property 
rights  affect  trade?”  According  to  the  author,  the  differences  in  property  rights  regimes  for 
environmental resources may be responsible for some aspects of the patterns of trade between North 
and South. 

According to Chichilnisky (1994), the global environment has handled North-South issue, due 
a concern about the international issues related to the environment. Consequently, there has been a 
concern in  linking  environmental policy with  economic issues of interest  to  the industrialized and 
developing countries (e.g. technology transfer). Thus, the problems involving property rights, which 
arise  when  societies  are  in  transition  from  an  agricultural  to  an  industrial  economy  trading  with 
already industrialized societies. 

3.  DATABASE 

The  data  structure  used  in  this  work  comes  from  of  the  World  Input-Output  Database 
(WIOD)8. As approached by Timmer (2012), the database was developed to analyze the effects of 
globalization on trade patterns, environmental pressures and socioeconomic development 

Therefore,  the  data  structure  of  the  present  work  consists  of  input-output  tables  for  40 
countries9  (27  EU  countries  and  13  other  selected  countries)  plus  the  “Rest  of  the  World”  for  the 
period  of  1995-200910.  It  is  important  to  note  that  these  tables  have  35  productive  sectors. 
Furthermore, this work also uses atmospheric emissions of CO2 (in tons) for the same 40 countries 
selected and the same range of time and sectors. 

Given the relevance and focus of this study, it is important to observe the behavior in terms 
of CO2 emissions for some countries. Figures 1-4, show the temporal evolution of the emissions of 
CO2  to  the  United  States  (USA),  China  (CHN),  Brazil  (BRA),  India  (IND)  and  Russia  (RUS), 
respectively. 

Through Figure 1, it is possible to observe that the United States (USA) present a behavior of 
increasing of CO2 emissions levels until the year 2000 and from this year present a decrease, except 
in 2007. Figure 2 shows the results for China (CHN). It is possible to observe a behavior different 

                                                           
8 For more details about the WIOD project see: Dietzenbacher et al. (2013), Erumban et al. (2012a, 2012b), Genty and 
Arto (2012), Timmer (2012).

Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Sweden, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, United 
Kingdom e United States. 
10 These countries together account for about 85% of world GDP (DIETZENBACHER et al., 2013). 

than presented by the United States (USA), because China presents small increases in emission levels 
for the early years (1995-2001) and from 2002 it presents the more significant additions. 

6 

For Brazil (BRA), Figure 3, it is possible to observe a behavior similar to observed for China (Figure 

6), i.e. the country also presents a performance of increase for most of the years, however at lower levels. 

Finally, for India, Figure 4, as well as for Brazil (BRA) and China (CHN), it is possible to 
observe the behavior of increase in CO2 emissions over the years (1995-2009). On the other hand, to 
Russia (RUS), Figure 4, it is possible to observe a behavior with larger oscillations. 

 

 

Thus, it is possible to observe a different behavior in terms of absolute CO2 emissions between 
the United States (USA) and BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China), for example. Given that USA 
and BRIC represent countries with different stages of development, the first is considered developed 
and the second as developing, important issues presented in the literature review can be discussed, 
such as: theory of EKC, carbon leakage, the pollution haven effect, the pollution haven hypothesis. 
In  addition,  other  issues  can  be  addressed,  such  as  differences  in  the  composition  of  natural  fuel 
reserves of the countries and institutional reforms adopted by them. 

However, this result should be seen at first only as an indication and motivation to analyze 
and test such theories, because other factors may be involved. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that an 
analysis of these results in the context of these hypotheses and theories is made in a late section. 
 
4. METHODOLOGY 
4.1. Input-Output Models (Conceptual Model and Representation)11 

In order to generalize, the model shown below is described considering an economy with a 
generic  number  of  n  sectors.  Thus,  it  is  possible  to  mathematically  represent  the  relationships,  as 
follows: 

𝑛
𝑋𝑖 = ∑
𝑗=1

𝑍𝑖𝑗 + 𝐶𝑖 + 𝐼𝑖 + 𝐺𝑖 + 𝐸𝑋𝑖             𝑖 = 1, 2, 3 … 𝑛

                       (1) 

where: Xi = total demand for total output of sector i; Zij = production of sector i, sold as intermediate input to 
sector j; Ci = production of sector i sold to families; Gi = production of sector i, sold to the government; 
Ii = production of sector i, sold as fixed investment; and EXi = production of sector i, sold to abroad, 
i.e. export. 

                                                           
11 This subsection is based on Miller and Blair (2009), and Guilhoto (2011). 

7 

However,  it  is  possible  to  have  an  inter-regional  input-output  model  that  describes  the 
particular  case  of  this  work,  i.e.,  an  economy  divided  into  41  regions  (27  EU  countries,  13  other 
selected countries and the “Rest of the World”): 

𝑍∗𝑖41𝑛 +   𝑌∗ = 𝑋∗                                                              (2) 

where:  𝑍∗  =  41nx41n  matrix  and  it  represents  the  interregional  input-output  table;  i41n  =  unit  vector  (all 
elements are equal to 1) with 41nx1 order; 𝑌∗ = 41nx1 vector and it represents the final demands of 
the regions, and 𝑋∗ = 41nx1 vector and it represents the production sector of the regions. 

Thus, the elements of equation (2) can be represented as follows: 

𝑍∗ =

Where the interregional input-output matrix is represented by 𝑍∗, and the sub-matrices 𝑍𝑖𝑗

1,1, 
41,41 are the sub-matrices with intra-regional flows and the other sub-matrices are 
2,2.....  𝑍𝑖𝑗
𝑍𝑖𝑗
related to inter-regional flows. The components 𝑌1, 𝑌2..... 𝑌40e 𝑌41; e 𝑋1, 𝑋2..... 𝑋40e 𝑋41 are vectors 
nx1 containing the final demands and product sectorial, respectively. 

40,40e 𝑍𝑖𝑗

However, as shown by Guilhoto (2011), assuming that the intermediate flows per unit of final 
product  are  fixed,  it  is  possible  through  the  inter-sector  flows  (Zij)  and  the  total  output  (Xi)  to 
determine  the  technical  coefficient.Thus  the  more  convenient  way  to  write  the  equation  (2)  is  to 
incorporate technical coefficients (A∗): 

A∗ = Z∗(X̂∗)−1                                                         (4) 

Rewriting it: 

Manipulating algebraically equation (5): 

A∗X∗ +   Y∗ =   𝑋∗                                                           (5) 

X∗ =   𝐵∗𝑌∗                                                              (6) 

where 𝐵∗ = (I − 𝐴∗)−1  corresponds to Leontief matrix for the IR-IP model. 

Thus, we can write the interregional model as follows:

4.2. Modeling CO2 Emissions12 

Wiebe et al. (2012) describes two forms of modeling of CO2 emissions in such models. The 
first,  suggested  by  Leontief  (1970)  uses  the  technique  of  adding  a  row  in  the  matrix  Leontief 
(pollution sector), providing pollution of all the other sections and having total pollution as the sum 
of the row (e.g. LENZEN, 1998; LENZEN et al., 2004; MILLER and BLAIR, 2009; CARVALHO 
et al., 2013). The second form of modeling, used by Peters and Hertwich and coauthors (e.g. PETERS 
and  HERTWICH,  2004,  2006),  it  is  to  multiply  the  Leontief  inverse  by  a  matrix  of  coefficients 
pollution intensity.  

Given that the objective of this study is to model CO2 emissions in terms of international trade, 
this paper uses the second method for modeling CO2 emissions in the context of input-output tables. 
In such modeling, it is necessary to keep in mind that emissions from one sector refer to the amount 
of pollution in terms of CO2 that a sector, in particular, emits to enable its production.  

                                                           
12 This subsection is based on Wiebe et al. (2012). 

The intensity coefficient of CO2 uses (CI’s) corresponding to the ratio of CO2 emission and 

the total output of sector i, i.e.: 

𝑛 =  

𝐶𝐼𝑖

𝑛
𝐸𝐶𝑂2𝑖
𝑛                                                                          (8) 
𝑉𝐵𝑃𝑖

8 

where:  𝐶𝐼𝑖

𝑛  is  the  intensity  coefficient  of  use  of  CO2  from  industry  i  in  the  country  n; 𝐸𝐶𝑂2𝑖

𝑛  is  the  CO2 

emissions of the sector i of country n, and 𝑉𝐵𝑃𝑖

𝑛 is the total output of industry i in the country n. 

Therefore,  the  CI  enables  us  to  classify  the  sector  as  intensive  or  not  with  respect  to  CO2 
emissions. Furthermore, the CI is the weighting factor of the input-output matrix, where in order to 
better capture the dependency and CO2 emissions among countries, the coefficients of intensity are 
calculated and the following algebraic operations are made: 

                                        Ê = [

Thus, the matrix Ê is used as follows: 

𝐶𝐼𝑖
⋮
0

1 ⋯ 0
⋮
41
𝐶𝐼𝑖

⋱
⋯

]                                                        (9) 

                                                𝐵¤ = 𝐵Ê                                                                (10) 

where 𝐵¤ represents the Leontief inverse matrix weighted by the emission of CO2. 

Therefore, the input-output model which uses the coefficient matrix of intensity of pollution 

(CO2 emission) can be written in matrix form as follows: 

Substituting (10) into (11) we have: 

where 𝜋 is the matrix of pollution. 

4.3. Miyazawa Multipliers13 

𝜋 = Ê𝑋 = Ê(𝐼 − 𝐴)−1𝑌                                                 (11) 

𝜋 = 𝐵¤𝑌                                                              (12) 

As explained by Fritz et al. (1998), it is important to make a distinction between polluting and 
non-polluting sectors of an economy. Thus, the notion of pollution generation, direct and indirect, 
becomes  another  factor  to  be  observed.  And  according  to  the  authors,  such  relationships  can  be 
explored through methodological framework originally proposed by Miyazawa (1966, 1968, 1971) 
and later extended by Sonis and Hewings (1993, 1995, 1997). 

Miyazawa's  work consists  of an application of internal  and external  multipliers. Miyazawa 
internal and external multipliers are derived to partition the Leontief inverse matrix in propagation of 
internal activity and of external activity, respectively (OKYAMA; SONIS; HEWINGS, 1999). 

According  to  Sesso  Filho  et  al.  (2006),  the  methodology  allows  to  classify  the  types  of 
synergistic  interactions  between  regions  and  enables  us  to  examine,  through  internal  and  external 
interdependencies, the structure of trade between two regions. 

First  it  is  exposed  the  methodological  framework  behind  Miyazawa  multipliers.  From  this 
initial  decomposition,  proposed  by  Miyazawa  and  based  on  Fritz  et  al.  (1998),  issues  involving 
pollution (CO2) can be derived. 

Therefore, consider the following input-output system with two regions14: 

 

𝑋11

)                                                 (13) 

where: 𝑍 represents trade flows (intermediate consumption), Y is the final demand. Thus, X equals the total 

output. 

                                                           
13 Based on Fritz, Sonis and Hewings (1998), Sonis and Hewings (1999b), and Okuyama, Sonis e Hewings (1999). 
14 Guilhoto et al. (2001) expanded and discussed the methodology proposed by Miyazawa for interregional model at the 
level of 5 macro regions of the Brazilian economy for the year 1995. 

9 

From the vector X and the trade flows matrix (Z), it is possible to obtain the matrix of technical 

coefficients (direct inputs)15: 

𝐴 = (

𝐴11
𝐴21

|

𝐴12
𝐴22

)                                                          (14) 

where 𝐴11and 𝐴22 are matrices of direct inputs of the first and second region, respectively.  𝐴12 and 𝐴21 are 

matrices of direct inputs purchased by the first and second regions, respectively. 

The  matrix  A  can  be  presented  in  a  separeted  form:  “Pull-Decomposition”.  Thus,  the  first 
region  is  decomposed  to  exert  an  influence  on  the  second  region  by  "pulling-input"  (import)  for 
production from this second region. The same decomposition and interpretation can be made to the 
second region. 

Thus, depending on the used perspective, the off-diagonal entries in equation (14) can be seen 

as "push" or "pull" linkages with other region: 

𝐴 = (

𝐴11
𝐴21

|

0
0
) + (
0
0

|

𝐴12
𝐴22

) = 𝐴1 + 𝐴2                                     (15) 

For purposes of this paper, a hierarchy and methodological framework, where the Leontief 

inverse matrix is given by 

𝐵 = (𝐼 − 𝐴)−1 = (

𝐵11
𝐵21

|

𝐵12
𝐵22

)                                                           (16) 

The matrices of internal multipliers Miyazawa for the two regions are given by: 

𝐵1 = (𝐼 − 𝐴11)−1                                                                     (17) 

𝐵2 = (𝐼 − 𝐴22)−1                                                          (18) 

 
where: 𝐵1 is a matrix multipliers internal for region 1 (country), and 𝐵2 for the region 2. 

However, Leontief inverse matrices can be defined as: 

𝛥1 = (𝐼 − 𝐴11 − 𝐴12𝐵2𝐴21)−1                                                  (19) 

𝛥2 = (𝐼 − 𝐴22 − 𝐴21𝐵1𝐴12)−1                                                   (20) 

This matrix 𝛥1 can be interpreted, according to Sonis and Hewings (1999b), as the external 
matrix  multiplication  of  the  first  region  revealing  the  influence  of  the  second16.  A  similar 
interpretation can be made to 𝛥2. 

By equations (14), (17) e (18), the following equations can be obtained: 

𝑃1 = 𝐴21𝐵1                                                                   (21) 
𝑃2 = 𝐵1𝐴12                                                                   (22) 
𝑆1 = 𝐴12𝐵2                                                                   (23) 
𝑆2 = 𝐵2𝐴21                                                                   (24) 

where: 𝑃1 is the matrix multiplier indicating input from Region 1 to Region 2 induced by internal propagation 
in Region 1. 𝑃2 is the matrix multiplier for internal propagation in Region 1 induced by transactions 
from Regions 1 to 2. A similar interpretation can be made to 𝑆1and 𝑆2, respectively. 

Thus, the external matrix multipliers for the regions can be derived as follows: 
 

𝛥11 = (𝐼 − 𝑃2𝑆2)−1 = (𝐼 − 𝐵1𝐴12𝐵2𝐴21)−1                                 (25) 

𝛥22 = (𝐼 − 𝑆2𝑃2)−1 = (𝐼 − 𝐵2𝐴21𝐵1𝐴12)−1                                 (26) 

                                                           
15 For more details see Miller e Blair (2009). 
16 Such terminology and interpretation are different from the original definition of the Miyazawa’s work as described by 
Sonis and Hewings (1999b). 

10 

𝛥11 includes direct, indirect and induced effects of sectors of the first region from the input demand 

effects of the second region. A similar relationship can be established for 𝛥22. 

 
Having  specified  and  derived  the  methodology  in  terms  of  Miyazawa  multipliers,  it  may 

extend to the environmental issue, i.e. CO2 emissions. 

Thus,  for  purposes  of  decomposition  of  the  methodology  in  terms  of  pollution  (CO2),  the 

multipliers of equations (19) and (20) are rewritten respectively as follows: 

 

∆1= ∆11𝐵1                                                             (27) 
∆2= ∆22𝐵2                                                             (28) 

As showed by Fritz et al. (1998), the following decomposition of the Leontief inverse matrix, 

equation (23), can be obtained: 

(𝐼 − 𝐴)−1 = (

∆1

𝐵1𝐴12∆2

∆2𝐴21𝐵1

∆2

)                                         (29) 

The first matrix multiplier of interest in the decomposed Leontief inverse of Eq. (29), ∆2𝐴21𝐵1, 
reveals the influence of the internal propagation of sectors in Region 1in the level of product of the 
sectors in the region 2. 

In order to evaluate the Region 1 sectors’ impact in terms of pollution, the matrix multiplier 
is premultiplied by a diagonal matrix of pollution coefficients, 𝑅̂, whose off-diagonal elements are all 
zero, and thus becomes a pollution matrix multiplier. Then, the matrix of pollution can be obtained: 

𝑃𝑜𝑙1 = 𝑅̂[∆2𝐴21𝐵1]                                                    (30) 

where:  𝑃𝑜𝑙1  is  matrix  of  pollution  multipliers  whose  elements, 𝑝𝑖2𝑗1,  represent  the  increase  in  pollution 
generated by industry 𝑖2 (region 2) as a result of a unit increase in final demand in industry, 𝑖1 (region 1). 

In order to evaluate the total amount of pollution generated by a unit increase in a Region 1 

industry’s output level, the appropriate column multipliers are calculated: 

𝑚𝑗1 = ∑ 𝑝𝑖2𝑗1

𝑖2

                                                           (31) 

where:  𝑚𝑗1  is industry 𝑗1’s column multiplier with respect to all the region 2’ industries. 

The multipliers of the matrix 𝑃𝑜𝑙1 result from the interaction of three multiplier matrices, ∆22, 
𝐵2 and 𝐵1, with 𝐴21. The sources of pollution induced by the region 1 sectors’ production activities 
can be unveiled by looking at the column sums of these matrices with respect to the region 2 sectors: 

i)  𝑅̂𝐴21 
ii)  𝑅̂𝐴21𝐵1 
iii)  𝑅̂𝐵2𝐴21𝐵1 

=  pollution generated by direct input requirements of Region 1; 

=  pollution caused by direct and indirect input requirements of Region 1; 
=  pollution  caused  by  internal  propagation  of  Region  1  and  the  induced  direct  and 

indirect production of Region 2; 

iv)  𝑅̂∆22𝐵2𝐴21𝐵1  =  total  pollution  multiplier  of  Region  1  with  pollution  caused  by  the  internal 
propagation  of  Region  1  and  the  induced  internal  and  external  propagation  of 
Region 2. 

 
The  sum  of  the  column  industries  𝑗1  in  i,  ii,  iii  e  iv  are  termed  as:  𝑚𝑗1

1 ,  𝑚𝑗1
respectively. Thus, the following definitions may be employed in the empirical analysis: 

2 ,  𝑚𝑗1

3   e  𝑚𝑗1, 

=  direct input requirements in the total multiplier; 

1  
i)  𝑚𝑗1
1    =  indirect input requirements in the total multiplier; 
2 − 𝑚𝑗1
ii)  𝑚𝑗1
2  
3 − 𝑚𝑗1
iii)  𝑚𝑗1
3  
iv)  𝑚𝑗1 − 𝑚𝑗1

=  internal propagation of Region 2 in the total multiplier; 

=  external propagation of Region 2 in the total multiplier. 

 

Similarly, we can derive and investigate the influence of region 2 in the product of region 1.

5. RESULTS 
5.1. Intensity Coefficients of CO2 Emissions 

From the input-output model and the availability of CO2 emissions, it is  possible to  obtain 
aggregated indicators for different countries. The intensity coefficients of CO2 emissions enable us 
to classify the country as intensive or not with respect to CO2 emissions. Moreover, these coefficients 
enable us to incorporate CO2 emissions in the input-output model by matrix Ê (Equation 9). 

It is important to note that the intensity coefficients of emission were calculated for the 40 
countries plus the "Rest of the World". However, for this paper Figures 5 and 6 show the results for 
the United States (USA), Germany (DEU), France (FRA), United Kingdom (GBR) and Japan (JPN), 
and China (CHN), Brazil (BRA), India (IND) and Russia (RUS), respectively17. 

From Figure 5, it is possible to observe, in general, a decrease in the magnitude of the intensity 
coefficient of CO2 emissions for selected countries (DEU, FRA, GBR, JPN and USA), representing 
a scenario of production with lower CO2 emission intensity. However, it is important to keep in mind 
that this does not necessarily reflect a decrease in the absolute amount of CO2 emissions. 

This  point  of  discussion  becomes  even  more  relevant  when  it  is  observed  the  intensity 
coefficients in developing countries, for example. Through Figure 6, we can observe that the intensity 
coefficients of CO2 emissions for developing countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) exhibit a 
behavior of decrease. However, as shown below, such countries have for the same period a behavior 
of increase in terms of absolute emissions of CO2. 

 

For  this  study,  the  coefficients  of  intensity  of  CO2  emissions  are  more  important  in 
methodological  terms  than  in  terms  of  the  result  itself,  since  they  are  used  to  incorporate  CO2 
emissions in international trade, this allow us to obtain results and discussions with regard to CO2 
emissions and international trade. 

Thus, the results and discussions involving emissions and international trade are presented in 
the next two sections (5.2 Trade balances of Global CO2 Emissions and 5.3 Miyazawa Multipliers). 

5.2. Trade balances of Global CO2 Emissions 

The input-output models, as discussed by Wiebe et al. (2012), allow us to obtain indicators of 
production  and  consumption  of  CO2  emissions  to  countries  and  regions,  for  example,  taking  into 
account the emissions embodied in international trade. 

The carbon trade balances are calculated from matrix π (equation 12) for all countries18 for 
the years 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2009, respectively. However, it is noteworthy, as the strategy used 
by Wiebe et al. (2012) and adapted to the database of this study, for purposes of calculating the trade 
balance of CO2 emissions, the π matrix is aggregated in a 41x41 trade matrix (number of spatial units, 
i.e. 40 countries plus the "rest the world"), showing the sales in terms of CO2 for each country in the 
rows and the purchases in terms of CO2 in the columns. Thus, from this matrix is done the calculus 
of the carbon trade balances for each country. Imports are derived from the sums of the rows, except 
the diagonal elements, and exports come from the column sums, again except the diagonal. 

                                                           
17 This selection has the intention to motivate through these preliminary results, discussions of hypotheses and theories 
around environmental issues. 
18 Complete results are available from the authors. 

12 

Thus, overall emissions embodied in the production and consumption are associated with the 
intermediate  flows  between  40  countries  plus  the  "Rest  of  the  World".  Pollution  embodied  in 
production is the CO2 emissions associated with the sale of inputs by a spatial unit (one country to 
the  other  39  countries  plus  the  "Rest  of  the  World").  And  similarly,  pollution  embodied  in 
consumption corresponds to the emissions associated with the acquisition of inputs. 

For  comparison,  Figure  7  shows  the  evolution  of  global  trade  balances  of  CO2  emissions 
embodied  in  international  trade19,  i.e.,  emissions  embodied  in  consumption  (dotted  lines)  and 
production (solid lines) for five countries: China (CHN) , Germany (DEU), United Kingdom (GBR), 
United States (USA), and Japan (JPN). 

Thus, with the Figure 7, on the one hand, we can see that for the USA the dotted line is above 
the solid line, i.e., CO2 emissions embodied in consumption are higher than the emissions embodied 
in  production  for  the  years  1995-2009.  On  the  other  hand,  for  GBR  the  line  solid  (production)  is 
above the dotted line (consumption) until  the  year 2004,  exhibiting similar behavior to  USA only 
from 2005. For DEU, it is possible to observe a behavior with oscillations between the years 1995 to 
2003  and  from  2004  presented  in  conduct  contrary  to  the  USA,  with  CO2  emissions  embodied  in 
production larger than emissions embodied in consumption. 

Finally, for JPN and CHN, it is possible to see that the solid line is above the dotted line, i.e., 
contrary to the behavior exhibited by the USA, for these two countries CO2 emissions embodied in 

production are higher than emissions embodied in consumption for the years 1995 to 2009. 

 

Similarly, Figure 8 shows the evolution of global trade balances of CO2 emissions embodied 
in international trade, i.e., emissions embodied in consumption (dotted lines) and output (solid lines), 
for a range of different countries: Brazil (BRA), Russia (RUS), India (IND) and China (CHN). 

On the one hand, RUS exhibits similar behavior to that presented by CHN with the solid line 
above the dotted line, i.e., CO2 emission embodied in the production being higher than the emission 
embodied in  the consumption for the  years 1995-2009. BRA, also, presents  a solid line above the 
dotted line, for most years, except 1999-2001. However, on the other hand, IND shows a different 
behavior, with the CO2 emissions embodied in the consumption higher than CO2 emissions embodied 
in production, for the years 1995 to 2009. 

Figure 9 shows, for comparison purposes, results of trade balances of some economies such 
as the United States (USA), Germany (DEU), France (FRA), United Kingdom (GBR), Japan (JPN), 
Russia (RUS), China (CHN), Brazil (BRA) and India (IND). Thus, through this figure we can see 
which  of  these  countries  are  classified  as  net  importers  of  CO2,  and  which  are  classified  as  net 
exporters of CO2

20 for the years 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2009. 

                                                           
19 Note that emissions embodied in international trade correspond to the emissions associated with intermediate flows of 
input-output tables. 
20 It is noteworthy that net importer and net exporter terms refer to the balance of CO2 emissions embodied in international 
trade. 

13 

The USA was the country with the highest net imports of CO2 for the four years in question, 
with a growth until 2005, more than tripling its net imports of CO2, and a decrease in 2009. On the 
other hand, the country with the highest net export of CO2 for the year 1995 was JPN, for the year 
2000 RUS, and for the years 2005 and 2009 CHN. Moreover, it is important to emphasize the growth 
evidenced by CHN, where the net export of CO2 quadruples when comparing 1995 with 2009. 

Regarding the classification of countries as exporters or importers of CO2, it is  possible to 
observe  USA  and  IND  as  net  importers  in  the  four  years  (1995,  2000,  2005,  and  2005).  On  the 
contrary, FRA, JPN, CHN and RUS are classified as net exporters in these four years. 

However, some countries such as BRA, DEU and GBR have different behavior over the years. 
DEU,  for  example,  in  the  first  two  years,  1995  and  2000,  is  classified  as  a  net  importer  of  CO2; 
however,  in  2005  and  2009  it  reverses  and  goes  on  to  present  a  profile  of  a  net  exporter  of  CO2. 
Regarding GBR, the pattern is given contrary to DEU; it is possible to observe a profile of net exporter 
in  the  first  two  years  and  a  net  importer  in  the  last  two  years.  Finally,  BRA  is  classified  as  a  net 
exporter in 1995, 2005, and 2009, and classified as a net importer only the year 2000. 

 

It is important to note that these results have similarities and differences with respect to other 
studies involving the same subject. The work of Wiebe et al. (2012), the basis for the methodology 
developed in this section shows, for example, similar results for the United States (USA), Germany 
(DEU),  Russia  (RUS),  China  (CHN),  i.e.  these  countries  have  the  same  behavior  in  terms  of 
classification  (net  exporter  or  net  importer  of  CO2  emissions),  with  differences  in  the  magnitude, 
which is justified by the use of different databases. However, it is also possible to observe different 
results for India (IND), France (FRA) and United Kingdom (GBR). 

Given the results of this section, and according to the purpose of this study, it is important to 
analyze  the  structure  of  trade  among  the  countries.  In  order  to  contribute  to  the  literature  on 
international trade and emissions, the next section presents the results for the Miyazawa multipliers. 
 
5.3. Miyazawa Multipliers21 
 

As  described  above  and  demonstrated  by  Hewings  et  al.  (2001),  the  Miyazawa  multiplier, 
external and internal, feature the degree of economic interaction between the two regions through the 
activities propagation of external and internal, respectively. However, for this study the Miyazawa 
multipliers able us to classify the structure of trade between two regions in terms of CO2 emissions, 
such as the application made by Fritz et al. (1998). 

Furthermore,  it  is  noteworthy  that  as  presented  by  Hewings  et  al.  (2001),  Miyazawa 
multipliers  can  be  derived  by  an  interregional  system  with  more  than  two  regions,  however,  the 
calculation of these multipliers requires the specification of the hierarchy (order) of propagation. So 
with  a  system  with  n-regions,  it  is  possible  to  construct  (n+1)!/2  combinations  of  "routes"  of 
propagation22.

The strategy used in this work is the pre-set pairs from the results found in previous sections, 
according to the literature and importance of the countries in the global context, and regarding the 
discussions  about  international  trade  and  CO2  emissions.  Thus,  the  Miyazawa  multipliers  for  this 
paper are calculated by taking pairs, the countries adopted as internal region (specified as R1 in the 
figures) at first are considered as external region later (specified in the figures as R2), such as example 
in Figure 10, where China (CHN) is considered the internal region and the United States (USA) the 
external region, however, in Figure 11, such specification is reversed. 

Thus, Figures 10-17 show the results of Miyazawa multipliers in terms of pollution for some 
pairs of countries. Note that the results represent the average of the Miyazawa multipliers,  i.e., the 
values of the figures are the average of 35 productive sectors for each countries and years. 

The results represent the increase of pollution generated by the external region (R2) industries 
as  a  result  of  the  increase  of  US$1.00  in  the  final  demand  of  the  internal  region  (R1).  Thus,  it  is 
possible to observe the pollution generated by the direct requirement of inputs for the internal region, 
pollution caused by the indirect requirement of inputs for the internal region, internal propagation of 
external  region  (pollution  induced  by  direct  and  indirect  production  of  the  external  region)  and 
external propagation from the external region23. Furthermore, the figures show the values for four 
specific years, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2009. 

The first figure (Figure 10) shows the results for economic interaction in terms of pollution 
(CO2  emissions)  to  China  (CHN)  and  the  United  States  (USA),  i.e.,  the  influence  of  internal 
propagation of China (CHN) in the level of pollution in the United States (USA). 

Through the Figure 10 it is possible to observe that the pollution generated by the direct and 
indirect  requirement  of  inputs  of  China  (CHN)  in  the  United  States  (USA),  blue  and  red  line, 
respectively, exhibit a similar behavior over the years, falling at first (1995 to 2000), and increasing 
thereafter (2005 to 2009). 

However,  the  highlights  are  the  results  found  for  the  pollution  caused  by  the  internal 
propagation of own United States (USA), black line, because it is possible to observe a decreasing 
trend, which represent an internal production process less polluter. 

The result becomes even more relevant  when it is considering the multiplier of the second 
figure (Figure 11), which shows the results for economic interaction in terms of pollution (CO2) of 
the United States (CHN) and China (CHN), i.e. the influence of the internal propagation of the United 
States (USA) at the level of pollution in China (CHN). 

From Figure 11 it is possible to observe an opposing behavior when the pollution caused by 
China's own internal propagation (CHN), given a monetary increase of one unit (US$) in final demand 
of  United  States  (USA),  is  analyzed.  Differently  what  it  is  observed  for  the  United  States  (USA), 
China (CHN) exhibits a behavior increased over the years, which represent a more polluter internal 
process. 

Moreover, in terms of pollution generated by the direct and indirect requirement of inputs of 
the United States (USA) in China (CHN), the behavior is similar over the years, with a tendency to 
increase (Figure 11). 

 

                                                           
23 The results for the external propagation are not shown in the figures, because they are characterized by low values due 
to their own methodological character. 

 

15 

Figure 12 shows the  results for economic interaction in  terms  of CO2 emissions for Brazil 
(BRA) and China (CHN).  In other words, it brings the influence of internal  propagation of Brazil 
(BRA) in the level of pollution of China (CHN). 

Thus,  by  Figure  12,  it  is  possible  to  observe  that  the  pollution  generated  by  the  direct  and 
indirect requirement of inputs from Brazil (BRA) in China (CHN), blue and red line, respectively, 
show a similar behavior of increase over the years. However, as it is observed for the United States 
(USA) and China (CHN), the highlights are the results found for the pollution caused by own internal 
propagation of China (CHN), black line, because it is possible observe a clear trend of increase, which 
is, as mentioned earlier, an internal production process more polluter. 

When the analysis is inverted, the pollution generated by the direct and indirect requirement 
of inputs of China (CHN) in Brazil (BRA), Figure 13, it is possible to observe a behavior of increase, 
however, with different magnitudes. Moreover, in terms of results for the pollution caused by internal 
propagation  of  Brazil  (BRA),  black  line,  it  is  possible  to  observe  a  similar  behavior  presented  by 
China (CHN), i.e., a tendency to increase, representing an internal process productive more polluter. 
However, for Brazil, Figure 13, between 2005 and 2009 it is possible to see a decrease. 

 

 

Figures 14 and 15 bring the results to the economic interaction in terms of pollution (CO2) for 
the United States (USA) and the BRIC. From Figure 14, it is possible to observe that the pollution 
generated by the direct and indirect requirement of inputs by United States (USA) in BRIC, blue and 
red line, respectively, exhibit a similar behavior over the years, an increase from 1995 to 2005 , and 
from this an behavior of decrease. 

However,  the  highlights  are  the  results  found  for  the  pollution  caused  by  the  internal 
propagation of BRIC, black line, because it is possible to observe a tendency to increase until 2005, 
which  represent  an  internal  productive  process  more  polluter,  and  from  2005  to  2009  an  inverse 
behavior (decrease). 

In  terms  of  results  for  the  influence  of  the  internal  propagation  of  BRIC  in  the  level  of 
pollution in the United States (USA), Figure 15, it is possible to observe an opposing behavior for 
pollution caused by internal propagation of the United States (USA) in comparison with what is seen 
to BRIC (Figure 14), i.e. internal production process less polluter. 

 

Finally, Figures 16 and 17 show the results to the economic interaction in terms of pollution 

to the European Union (EU) and the BRIC. 

 

16 

At Figure 16 it is possible to observe the influence of internal propagation of the European 
Union (EU) in the level of pollution of BRIC, where the pollution generated by the direct and indirect 
requirement of inputs of the European Union (EU) in BRIC, blue and red line , respectively, show a 
similar decreasing behavior. 

Moreover,  with  respect  to  pollution  caused  by  internal  propagation  BRIC,  black  line,  it  is 
possible  to  verify  a  tendency  of  increase,  which  represents  an  internal  production  process  more 
polluter until the year 2005 and contrary a behavior of decrease from 2005 to 2009. 

When  the  analysis  is  reversed,  i.e.,  the  pollution  generated  by  the  direct  and  indirect 
requirement of inputs of BRIC in the European Union (EU), Figure 17, it is possible to see that they 
also show a similar behavior, i.e., both exhibit a behavior of increase between 1995 and 2000 and 
from that, a decrease behavior (i.e. 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2009). 

In terms of pollution caused by internal propagation of the European Union (EU) two different 
scenarios are observed, first representing a more polluter production process (1995-2000) and then a 
reverse production process, less polluter (2000-2009). 

 

The results of this section allowed us to  analyze  the  structure of trade  relations among  the 
countries in terms of pollution (CO2 emissions). Thus, in the next section we will make a discussion 
and analysis of all the results of this work. 

 

5.4. DISCUSSION 

Given these results and discussions described in the literature review, an analysis in terms of 
developed and developing countries seem to be relevant. Through Figures 1-4, we can think about 
such discussion, because there is  an evidence, on the one hand, of increase in  emissions from  the 
United States (USA), developed country, in the first instance and subsequently a high decrease. On 
the other hand, there is a contrary evidence to China (CHN), Brazil (BRA), India (IND) and Russia 
(RUS), developing countries. 

In terms, for example, the theory of EKC, as approached before, this result may be an evidence 
that the increase in income is associated with an increase in pollution in  early stages of economic 
development and a decline in pollution in more advanced stages. However this is not the main focus 
of this work, so it is not done any empirical test to evaluate this hypothesis. 

However, other hypotheses can be discussed, such as carbon leakage. These results can be 
linked  in  some  way  to  a  carbon  leakage  from  developed  to  developing  countries.  Even  more 
specifically, it can be represented, for example, the use of international trade to reduce CO2 emissions. 
Another  hypothesis  that  can  be  evaluated  is  the  pollution  haven  effect,  i.e.  a  pollution 
regulations taking effect on plant location decisions and trade flows. Or even more strongly, that a 
reduction  in  trade  barriers  is  leading  to  a  shift  of  pollution-intensive  industry  in  countries  with 
stringent rules for countries with weaker regulations (pollution haven hypothesis). 

However, despite the results of the absolute emissions presented evidence that they can apply 
and discuss some of the theories, before drawing conclusions, it is necessary to look at the results 
around the international  trade, which for this study consists of the results extracted from of input-
output tables: (a) Trade Balance of Global CO2 Emissions; and (b) Miyazawa Multipliers. 

17 

Through the first results, it is possible to present a discussion of responsibility for emissions 
and consider the different behaviors in terms of developed and developing countries, for example. 
Given  the  results  presented  in  Figures  1-4  (absolute  emissions)  it  is  observed  that  developing 
countries present behavior of increase in CO2 emissions.  

However, such results may lead to erroneous conclusions and attributions of responsibility for 
emissions, because they consider only the territorial emissions. When we observe, for example, the 
evolution  of the global balances of CO2 emissions embodied in  international  trade,  i.e., emissions 
embodied in consumption and production, different evidence and conclusions can be made. 

Taking as exercise the global balances of CO2 emissions of the United States (USA) and the 
BRIC  (Brazil,  Russia,  India  and  China),  for  example,  Figures  7  and  8,  it  is  possible  to  observe 
different results compared to those presented for emissions absolute CO2. 

On  the  one  hand,  the  United  States  (USA)  have  CO2  emissions  embodied  in  consumption 
higher than emissions embodied in  production for the  years 1995-2009.  On the other hand, China 
(CHN)  and  Russia  (RUS)  have  emissions  CO2  embodied  in  production  higher  than  emissions 
embodied  in  consumption  for  the  years  1995  to  2009.  Brazil  (BRA),  shows  a  similar  behavior  of 
Russia  (RUS)  and  China  (CHN)  with  except  from  1999  to  2001.  Finally,  India  (IND)  have  a 
differently behavior, CO2 emissions embodied in consumption higher than CO2 emissions embodied 
in production for the years 1995-2009. Thus, it is possible to affirm that the United States (USA) and 
India (IND) are classified as net importers of CO2, and China (CHN), Brazil (BRA) and Russia (RUS) 
are net exporters of CO2.  

These exercises show interesting results around international trade, however, as described in 
the  previous  section,  the  results  concerning  the  trade  structures  among  countries,  Miyazawa 
multipliers, can contribute further in terms of the relationship between international trade and CO2 
emissions. 

Given the results described in the previous section, it is possible to observe, for example, that 
when you have the pairing between the United States (USA) and European Union (EU), developed 
countries, with China (CHN), developing country, the result is similar. An increase of a US$1.00 in 
the final demand in China (CHN) in terms of pollution in the United States (USA) is lower over the 
year, i.e., evidence that the internal production process of the USA is increasingly less polluter. 

The result of the pairing becomes more attractive when it reverses the analysis and the shock 
of final demand, i.e., an increase of a US$1.00 in the final demand is given in the United States (USA) 
in  relation  to  China (CHN).  It  is  observed that the internal  production process  of China  (CHN) is 
more polluter, given the interaction. 

Consider  other  pairings  between  developed  and  developing  countries,  it  is  possible  to  see 
similar  results.  The  pairing  between  USA  and  BRA,  or  between  the  United  States  (USA)  and 
European Union (EU) with the BRIC, it is possible, on the one hand, observe an internal production 
process more polluter of developing countries and blocks (Brazil and BRIC) and, on the other hand, 
a production process less polluter for developed countries and blocks (EU and USA). 

When the analysis is done in terms of interaction between two developing countries (South-
South)  as  Brazil  (BRA)  and  China  (CHN),  it  is  possible  to  observe  a  more  polluter  domestic 
production process. 

Given these results for the pre-defined pairings and thinking about the discussions described 
in the literature review lead us to raise questions about the theories behind the carbon leakage, the 
pollution haven effect, the pollution haven hypothesis, the use of environmental policy as a substitute 
for trade policy, the use of trade policy to achieve environmental goals, and patterns of trade between 
North and South, for example. 

The results for China (CHN), for example, always have a more polluter production process, 
which can be interpreted as a carbon leakage, where countries that have a trade relation with China 
(CHN) may be taking advantage of international  trade to reduce their emissions. Looking at these 
results plus global trade balances of CO2 there is further evidence that international trade is being 
used to reduce emissions. 

18 

Given  these  results,  as  it  was  discussed  for  absolute  emissions,  it  is  possible  to  make  a 
question: do we have a case of pollution haven effect? Although the present study does not provide 
evidence for the regulation by  countries, it is  possible to  present  a simple discussion, because the 
literature  points  to  a  situation  where  Northern  countries  have  strong  regulations  and  Southern 
countries a weak regulations (e.g. Copeland and Taylor 2004 and Taylor, 2005) 

Given that we have examples of North-South pairings (e.g. the United States and China, the 
United States and BRIC) with South increasingly more polluter and North less polluter, it is possible 
to think that regulation can be affecting the location decisions of plants, for example. Or even more 
strongly,  that  a  reduction  in  trade  barriers  can  lead  the  shift  of  pollution-intensive  industry  from 
countries with stringent regulations (North) to countries with weaker regulations (South), a hypothesis 
known as the pollution haven hypothesis. 

However,  although  the  results  present  evidence  that  such  theories  may  be  occurring,  it  is 

necessary to interpret the results with caution, because these results represent only an exercise. 

 

6. CONCLUSIONS 
 

As shown in this work, the problem of GHG and related climate change is an important debate 
in international economies, where research efforts have increasingly taken into account sustainable 
consumption. However, although it has been possible to observe some progress, real initiatives for 
more  sustainable  consumption  have  not  materialized.  Thus,  efforts  to  develop  more  efficient  and 
effective consumption systems are still unknown, with little practical advance (Tukker et al., 2006). 
In terms of contribution, for example, the present study sought through multipliers Miyazawa 
address the issues of feedback loop among countries. Furthermore, this study used a solid database 
(WIOD  project)  in  terms  of  compatibility  of  Input-Output  Tables  and  atmospheric  CO2,  the  same 
range of time and sectoral disaggregation. 

The  following  results  can  be  highlighted:  i)  the  increase  of  CO2  emissions  in  developing 
countries (e.g. Brazil , Russia, India and China); ii) the opposing behavior of the USA and BRIC, 
with the exception of India, in terms of net balances of emissions embodied in international trade; iii) 
evidence  that  the  decrease  of  CO2  emissions  in  some  countries  comes  from  greater  interaction  in 
terms of trade with other countries; iv) the developed countries have an internal production process 
increasingly less polluter, and contrary to, developing countries have an internal production process 
more polluter, given the pairing between them. 

Furthermore,  this  study,  through  the  different  results,  makes  a  discussion  around 

environmental theories and hypotheses involving international trade. 

Although the results present evidence that such theories may be occurring, it is necessary to 
interpret the results with caution, as these results represent an exercise. Although it is possible to note 
a pattern, it is important to observe other interactions, because countries interact differently. In general 
the  relation  of  cause  and  effect  relation  between  emissions  and  international  trade  has  other 
components, e.g. cost, capital mobility and hand labor, which are not addressed in the scope of this 
work. 

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that it is not the scope of this paper to discuss and present all 
pairings that can be performed using as a basis the 41 spatial units (i.e. 40 countries plus the "Rest of 
the  World").  The  pairings  chosen  sought  to  highlight  the  issues  related  to  the  integration  process 
among countries and the impact on emissions. The choice of pairings can also take into consideration 
components sociological and political-economy, for example. This may be a possible extension of 
this work.
