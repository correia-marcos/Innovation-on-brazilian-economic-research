ABSTRACT 

This paper documents the evolution and the main close determinants of earnings inequality in the Brazilian 
formal  sector  from  1994  to  2015  using  matched  employer-employee  administrative  records.  In  2015, 
schooling explained 33% of overall inequality. Firms' specific effects explain 65% of total inequality. Firms 
are also central to explain the marked inequality fall observed. This downward trend parallels the one seen 
in household surveys. However, the distributive decompression goes only until the 90th percentile, which 
is  in  line  with  Personal  Income  Tax  based  evidence.  Specific  groups’  analysis  shows  that  the  share  of 
inequality explained by top 1% and 0.1% incomes rose 43% and 91%, respectively.

RESUMO 

Este  artigo  utiliza  registros  administrativos  de  empresas  para  analisar  a  evolução  e  os  principais 
determinantes próximos da desigualdade de renda no setor formal brasileiro entre 1994 e 2015. Em 2015, 
a  escolaridade  explicou  33%  da  desigualdade  total.  Efeitos-fixos  das  empresas  explicaram  65%  da 
desigualdade total. Empresas também tem papel nevrálgico entre os elementos que explicaram a queda 
marcada  de  desigualdade  observada.  Esta  tendência  negativa  guarda  semelhanças  com  a  observada  nas 
pesquisas domiciliares. Porém, a descompressão distributiva vai apenas até o percentil 90, fato que está em 
linha com as evidências obtidas através dos dados do Imposto de Renda. Análises de grupos específicos 
revelam que a parcela da desigualdade explicada pelo top 1% e 0,1% mais ricos aumentou 43% e 91%, 
respectivamente.

EARNINGS INEQUALITY IN THE BRAZILIAN FORMAL SECTOR: THE ROLE 

OF FIRMS, EDUCATION AND TOP INCOMES 1994-2015 

 

1.  Introduction  

The vast majority of the empirical literature in developing countries on income distribution is based 
on household surveys. Brazil established this tradition during the early 1970s just after the second set of 
the Demographic Census income data was released (Fishlow 1972; Langoni 1973; Bacha and Taylor 1978). 
Recently,  a  series  of  papers  have  documented  inequality  based  on  Personal  Income  Tax  (PIT)  records 
(Medeiros et al. 2015a; Souza 2016; Medeiros et al. 2015b). However, establishment-level administrative 
records are also available in Brazil, but those have rarely been used in studies of income inequality.  RAIS 
(Registro  Anual  de  Informações  Sociais)  is  a  matched  employer-employee  data  that  gathers  around  30 
million observations on workers per year over the last two decades by the Brazilian Labor Ministry. RAIS 
depicts formal employment dynamics and wage differentials and is a powerful tool that may complement 
the evidence presented by other data sources (Alvarez et al., 2017; Machado et al., 2017). 

This paper describes the evolution and the main determinants of earnings inequality in the Brazilian 
formal sector from 1994 to 2015 using RAIS. We plot growth incidence curves and Lorenz curves over the 
period of analysis, and calculate the main inequality indexes used in the literature such as earnings ratios 
across different percentiles in the individual earnings distribution, the Gini index and the Theil indexes. We 
discuss the role of wages, employment, missing values among other measurement issues. We also compare 
these  results  using  RAIS  with  broader  household  surveys.  Second,  we  use  standard  inequality 
decompositions  based  information  theory  to  understand  the  main  determinants  of  formal  earnings 
dispersion. This includes workers’ characteristics (such as gender, race, age, education and spatial location) 
and firms’ characteristics (sector of activity, firm size, legal nature, etc.). Besides applying between and 
within groups decomposition for Theil T and Theil L indexes (Theil 1967), we use J-Divergence measures 
to disentangle the  role played by specific  categories of different variables (Jeffreys 1946; Rohde 2016; 
Hecksher et al. 2017).  

We find an overall fall in inequality after 1994. Moreover, schooling was responsible for explaining 
32.8%  of  labor  income  inequality  in  2015  and  24.1%  in  1994,  considering  the  Theil-T  index.  The 
explanatory power of firm-specific was around 65% for the entire series analyzed (1994-2015), suggesting 
that differences between firms explain the largest share of inequality in the Brazilian formal labor market. 
These results agree with Alvarez et al. (2017), who found that firms played an important role in explaining 
inequality  level  and  also  the  decrease  in  earnings  inequality  in  Brazil.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the 
between-firm component also seems to drive the overall inequality in developed countries such as the U.S. 
(Song et al., 2015) and Germany (Card et al. 2015). 

Changes in earnings distribution in the formal sector share some of the trends observed in household 
surveys,  in  particular,  a  marked  fall  in  inequality  between  2001  and  2014.  The  monotonic  decrease  of 
earnings growth goes only until the 90 percentile above this point the trend is reverted, which is in line with 
evidence based on Personal Income Tax data. J-Divergence shows that the share of inequality explained by 
the top 1% and 0.1% rose since 1995 43.1% and 90.1%, respectively. Similarly, the share of inequality 
explained by  those with more than high school increased 29.5% in the same period. 

The paper is organized into eight sections as follows. Section 2 discusses the main aspects of the 
dataset used on this note, in comparison to other distributive studies. Section 3 defines the indicators applied 
in the analysis.  Section 4 provides the details about the data construction process. Section 5 discusses 
measurement  issues  on  income  distribution  (such  as  earnings  vs.  hourly  earnings,  missing  values,  null 
values and the role of employment on earnings inequality), calculates the standard inequality indexes and 
plots  growth  incidence  curves  and  the  Lorenz  curve.  Section  6  applies  information  theory  based 
decompositions between and within groups. Section 7 disentangle the effects of specific top income and

concludes.  

 

2.  Background of RAIS based Distributive Studies 

Most of the analyses on Brazilian income distribution is based on household surveys, in particular 
the Pesquisa Nacional de Amostras a Domicílio (PNAD – IBGE), the main Brazilian National Household 
Survey.  However,  RAIS  has  some  advantages.  First,  it  allows  combining  formal  workers  and  firms’ 
information to understand wage inequality determinants. In particular, the incorporation of individual firms 
fixed effects explains the bulk of earnings distribution levels and changes (Alvarez et al. 2017). Second, it 
is the only nationwide data source available with long spells of panel data. This longitudinal aspect allows 
studying the mobility of workers across sectors and individual firms as well as the life-cycle profile of these 
characteristics  (Machado  et  al.  2017).  Third,  RAIS  also  offers  the  possibility  of  analyzing  short  run 
employment and wage dynamics because it contains information on a monthly basis – used in Brazil - that 
allows aggregation to higher time measurement periods - like a year used in most countries5. This may 
facilitate international data comparisons since the measurement unit varies across countries. Fourth, RAIS 
provides a unique perspective on certain policy related issues. The evaluation of legal employment quotas 
for People With Disabilities (PWD), and for the youth that requires certain shares of firms employment 
allocated for these groups is only possible using the establishment as the unit of information and analysis 
(Neri et al. 2003). RAIS also allows to measure how binding are minimum wages in the bottom of formal 
employment earnings distribution (Engbom and Moser 2017). Finally, RAIS unlike other data sources does 
not  have  top  coding  which  permits  to  measure  wages  at  the  very  upper  tail  of  earnings  distribution. 
Nevertheless, RAIS does not include the informal sector, which is very large in Brazil and mostly misses 
wages at the lower end of the distribution. Employers and top earners that constitute a juridical person for 
tax purposes are also not in RAIS. With these caveats in mind, we note RAIS has been rarely employed in 
studies of the Brazilian income inequality until recent years. 

Our calculations over PNAD present in Figure 1 show a fall of the Gini of per capita income, the 
most widely used measure, since 1993. However, the bulk of inequality reduction happened between 2001 
and 2014. A similar pattern emerges in the concentration index of individual labor income in RAIS (see 
Figure 2). A second point to notice in the graph is that the fall of per capita income from all sources Gini 
index  in  the  2001  to  2014  period  is  more  pronounced  than  the  corresponding  fall  of  individual  labor 
concentration index. One possible explanation is that the fall of correlation between schooling of heads and 
spouse from 0.73 to 0.61 between 2001 and 2015 reinforces the per capita income but not that of individual 
labor earnings. Another possibility is that the expansion of other income sources such as social security 
benefits and conditional cash transfers is behind this difference (Barros et al., 2006; Kakwani et al., 2010). 

 

3.  Inequality Analysis 

We briefly describe the inequality measures and decomposition we perform in the paper. Readers 

familiar with them can skip this section without prejudice. Further details are in the Appendix.

earnings  this include  both sources  of  variability  changes  of  employment  and  of  real  wages  within the 12-month 
period.

3.1.Inequality Indexes 

Gini Index 
The Gini is an inequality index, corresponding to the ratio between the mean absolute deviations of 
the incomes of all the people in the sample and twice the mean income. (cid:1) is the population size. Once there 
are 	(cid:3)	((cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:6))

 distinct pairs of people in the sample, Gini’s formula is: 

(cid:8)
(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:10) =	

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

1

 

(cid:14)(cid:1)((cid:1) − 1) (cid:16) (cid:16)	(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)	(cid:5)	(cid:18)(cid:20)(cid:17)
where (cid:18)(cid:19)		,(cid:18)(cid:20)  is individual earnings for two generic and distintic individuals i and j while (cid:14)  
is overall mean income. This formula yields the polar cases: 
Perfect Equality: when all individuals have the same income, (cid:18)(cid:19)	 = (cid:14)∀(cid:10), the sum above is equal to 

(cid:19)	(cid:21)	(cid:20)

(cid:20)

zero and Gini is also equal to zero. 

Perfect Inequality: when one individual has all the wealth ((cid:1)(cid:14)), we have (cid:1)	–	1 pairs with absolute 

deviations equal to (cid:1)(cid:14), while the rest of the pairs have null deviations. Therefore, Gini is equal to one. 
 
  The  fact  that  the  Gini  index  ranges  from  0  to  1  makes  its  interpretation  simpler.  The  direct 
calculation of the Gini Index from the Lorenz Curve is another explanation for its popularity. However, 
since the Gini Index is not decomposable, we complement the analysis by using the Theil Indexes. 

 

Theil Indexes (Theil 1967, Bourguignon 1979, Shorrocks 1980, Foster 1983, Ramos 1993) 

The Theil-T index is defined by the following formula: 

T

= n
∑

=
1

i

The second Theil measure of inequality is Theil-L index, defined by the following formula: 

L

= n
∑

=

i

log

while in Theil T the inequality factors of weighting within the groups are the share of retained income, in 
Theil L the inequality factors of weighting within the groups are their respective share of population.  

J-Divergence  

J-divergence equals to the sum between two Theil inequality measures (T + L): 

J = 1
N(cid:16)x(cid:31) − μ
μ

log$x(cid:31)
μ%

 

&

(cid:31)’(cid:6)

This is another measure based on information theory that relates shares in population with shares in 
income and evaluates the level of dissonance between both distributions. While the Theil-T departs from 
population shares and calculates the information dissonance with income shares distribution, the Theil-L 
runs in the opposite direction from income to population shares. The J-Divergence takes a more neutral 
position taking the sum of both directions. This measure is known with different names such as symmetric 
Kullback-Leibler  divergence,  symmetric  relative  entropy,  symmetric  Theil  measure  or  J-divergence,  in 
honour  of    Jeffreys  (1946)  seminal  article.    Given  this  symmetry  and  other  decomposition  properties  - 
described next - we choose to express most of our results in terms of the J-Divergence.

The Dual of Theil-T 

The dual concept allows comparisons between different inequality measures. Keeping the scale 
from 0 to 1. And allowing a direct analysis of the introduction of a new proportion of null values in the 
original income inequality measure. In the case of the Theil-T it can be shown that: 

T

= T

1

f-

1ln(

)

   

1T  and  

2T  are initial and final values of the Theil-T index before and after adding af proportion 
where 
of new null values. Since the Theil-L and the J-Divergence do not admit null values, they also do not admit 
a Dual measure. 

 

3.2 Within and Between Groups Decompositions 

This framework attempts to identify the main structural determinants of inequality. We explore a 
step further quantifying the close causes of its evolution by performing a standard inequality decomposition 
exercise among k-groups of a given characteristic such as education, for example:

corresponds  to  the  income  weighted  “within  groups" 

component.  We  will  address  these  components  for  subgroups  arbitrarily  defined  according  to  workers' 
characteristics (gender, race, age, schooling and region) and firms' characteristics (sector of activity, legal 
nature  of  the  firm,  firm  size  and  firms  specific  effect).  Te  /  T  is  the  gross  contribution  of  a  certain 
characteristic to inequality measured by the Theil-T. The Theil-L index can be decomposed in a similar 
fashion.  

L = Le +	(cid:16)πℎ	Lℎ

 

+

,’(cid:6)

Hence, J-Divergence that is the sum of Theil-T and Theil-L can be written as: 

J = T- + L- +	(cid:16)Yℎ	Tℎ

In the decomposition formulas for the three information theory based inequality indicators presented 
above, each group has between and within components. Meaning there are differences between income and 
population shares for each group and also differences within these groups.  The standard decomposition

analysis relies on the sum of all between groups distribution dissonance terms to evaluate their relative 
contribution to total inequality.  

 

3.3 J-Divergence Specific Groups Decomposition 

Besides allowing the usual decomposition between and within groups, the J-Divergence measure 
yields a non-negative contribution of each individual, or specific groups of individuals in total inequality7.  
Why do we care about specific groups and not only variables? Because, for example, we would like to see 
how much top 1% incomes, or people with completed higher education contribute to overall inequality 
measures. Or in the limit we would like to know how much a single person - say the richest person alive - 
explains  overall  inequality.  This  contribution  considers  each  particular  group  between  and  within 
components. 

To  be  sure,  departing  from  the  last  formula  above,  instead  of  summing  all  groups  between 
components as in the traditional gross contribution analysis, we choose a specific group among k groups 
and compute its respective particular overall inequality impact picking both between and within respective 
components. As opposed to other measures derived from information theory such as Theil-T and Theil-L, 
individual groups contribution to this measure is always greater or equal to zero. This property makes total 
inequality equals to the simple sum of non-negative individual divergences. This tool allows to go beyond 
impact  of  characteristics,  and  assess  the  direct  impact  of  specific  groups  of  this  characteristic  in  total 
inequality. 

Overall,  we  will  develop  most  of  the  analysis  in  terms  of  the  J-Divergence  measure  given  its 
enhanced  additive  decomposability  properties8.  When  we  assess  the  impact  of  specific  groups,  such  as 
individuals with higher education or in the top percentile, we take advantage of the J-Divergence additive 
groups criteria. We will also use J-Divergence in the usual between and within groups’ decomposition. In 
these cases, we also present in the tables the other two Theil indicators to allow visualizing the construction 
of the J-Divergence measure and to test the robustness of the results found using more widespread measures. 
We will assess the contribution of different characteristics and groups in 2015 and to the change observed 
between 1994 and 2015. 

 

4.  Data 

This research uses RAIS (Relação Anual de Informações Sociais), a matched employer-employee 
dataset provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Labour. It constructs a data set covering the universe of the 
formal  labour  market  in  Brazil  through  restricted-access  administrative  records  with  an  average  of  33 
million observations per year from 1994 to 2015. 

In  Brazil,  firms  are  required  to  report  all  the  workers  formally  employed  at  some  point  in  the 
previous calendar year and each worker is identified by a unique number (PIS, Programa de Integração 
Social), which allows us to follow the employees over time and across firms. Firms also have a unique 
identifier (CNPJ, Cadastro Nacional de Pessoa Jurídica). Thus, our dataset allows us to track workers and 
firms over time. RAIS contains a set of variables on both firms' and employees' characteristics as well as 
about the characteristics of the employment contract. Precisely, the information in the dataset includes firm-
related variables (sector of activity, size, state, etc.), worker-related variables (gender, age, schooling, etc.) 
and job-related variables (earnings, occupation, weekly hours of work, etc.).  

In this note, we restrict the analyses at those employment contracts that were active on December 
31.  In case of more than one employment, we select that job with the higher salary (in minimum wages). 
We  calculate  the  real  earnings  in  December  2015  by  multiplying  the  variable  "wage  in  December  (in 

                                                            
7 See also Rohde 2016, Hecksher et al. 2017 and the Appendix. 
8 Except when we want to incorporate zeros we use the dual concept of the Theil-T. Since it does not exist for the 
Theil-L and J-Divergence measures. Another advantage of the dual is to keep the domain of the indicator in the 0 to 
1 interval.

minimum wages)" and the value of the minimum wage in each year, and using the INPC (Índice Nacional 
de Preços ao Consumidor) as the deflator. This data is available since the beginning of the series.9  

Wage Measurement 

We chose the start year of our data in 1994 because it is the earliest in which we have information 
about all the variables that will be used in the analysis. Also, it is the period after the stabilization of inflation 
in Brazil, which would introduce extra measurement error in the analysis. On the other hand, 2015 is the 
most recent year which we have access to the RAIS data set. 

Before 1999, earnings in RAIS were only expressed using Minimum Wages as a numeraire. After 
that,  one  may  opt  between  this  and  nominal  earnings  expressed  in  Brazilian  Reais.  Figure  3  presents 
inequality measures for 2015 using these two income units possibilities. The two are very similar, which 
suggests that conclusions are not affected by the concept used.  

Missing Values 

The individual earnings data present 3.04 percent of reported zeros, which is not allowed according 
to Brazilian Minimum Wage legislation. We treat these zeros as missing values. The share of zeros falls 
from 4.83 percent in 1994 to 3.7 percent in 2015 (See Figure 4). Nonetheless, we show that the Theil-T 
inequality measure that incorporates the zeros (through the dual concept explained in the previous section) 
remains very similar. 

Hourly Earnings 

Another possibility is to express inequality in terms of hourly-earnings, instead of total earnings. 
One may argue that hourly-earning is more relevant than total earning. However, reported hours in RAIS 
correspond to contractual hours and assume mostly the same value for all observations within the same 
firm. In Figure 5, we calculate the Theil-T index using both measures. The 2015 inequality level measured 
with  Theil-T  rises  28.3  percent  with  hourly-earnings  (0.597/0.466),  while  the  1994  to  2015  inequality 
reduction rises almost 10 percentage points, from 17.1 percent (0.099/0.565)  to 27.1 percent (0.222/0.819) 
when  we  use  the  latter  concept.  Between  2001  and  2014,  a  period  of  falling  inequality,  the  difference 
between income concepts amounts to 4 percentage points. Most of the hourly-earnings inequality reduction 
happens just at the start of the series, but the trends in the two series are almost parallel, as Figure 5 shows. 

 

5.  Comparisons between Inequality Measures: Levels and Trends 

Mean Growth and Inequality Trends 

Before  assessing  inequality  of  positive  earnings  distribution,  it  is  worth  addressing  mean  and 
dispersion of earnings growth together with formal employment growth (see Figure 6). Between 1994 and 
2015,  mean  earnings  grew  29.6  percent  in  real  terms  while  formal  employment  grew  107  percent, 
amounting to a 165.2 percent growth in terms of the total mass of formal wages earned. This means that of 
the total increase in formal earnings, three quarters are due to formal employment growth. If we subtract 
the total Brazilian population growth, 34.4 percent according to the PNAD (National Household Survey), 
the cumulative growth of the earnings mass expressed on a per capita basis is 97.4 percent.  

An alternative way is to look at the share of formal employees relative to the whole population. In 
the 1994-2015 period, this share has increased 54 percent, changing  from 14.5 percent to 22.3  percent. 
Figure 7 and Table 1 presents the  evolution of standard inequality measures applied to strictly positive 
earnings according to RAIS in the 1994-2015 period, in which the Gini reduced from 0.547 to 0.472. This 
trend  is  also  verified  for  the  Theil-L  and  the  Theil-T  indexes,  and  hence  the  J-divergence.  From  2001 
onwards, especially until 2014, there is a clearer inequality downward trend and it may be advisable also 
to consider this period of analysis. For example, when we look at J-Divergence all of the inequality fall

observed from 1994 to 2001 happened in the first three years. Brazilian inflation fell sharply with the launch 
of the Real stabilization Plan occurred in mid-1994 but inflation was still falling in the 1994 to 1996 period. 
This may affect inequality assessment especially when we consider monthly earnings as it is the case in 
Brazil.   

Growth Incidence  

Figure 8 plots cumulative growth curves across the 1994 to 2015 period, from the bottom vintile to 
the top 0.1 percent, yielding growth in the bottom 5 percent of 364.3 percent falling monotonically as we 
approach the top decile when it reaches 12.27 percent then there is a reversion of this trend reaching growing 
monotonically as we approach the top 0.1% where growth is 35.31 percent. Zooming in, we separate the 
growth rates in the lower from the top parts of the distribution. It is clear the compression of inequality up 
to the top decile and the decompression from this point onwards to the very top of the income distribution 
(see Figures 9 and 10). The two lowest vintiles in the formal sector are directly affected by the real minimum 
wage  hikes  occurred  in  this  period.  The  value  of  the  minimum  wage  in  2015  was  R$  788,  situated  in 
between earnings levels in the first two vintiles, R$ 544 and R$ 812, respectively. 

Lorenz Curves 

We start with the most general representation of inequality provided by the Lorenz curve. Figure 11 
presents the Lorenz curve in percentiles from 1995 to 2015 in evenly distributed five-year intervals.  The 
curves moved inwards over the years suggesting a continuous earnings inequality reduction.  In order to 
verify the occurrence of Lorenz dominance across these five-year periods, we plot the difference between 
these curves, as shown in Figure 12. The Lorenz curves for the pair of years 1995 and 2000 and also 2000 
and 2005 crossed themselves in the upper percentiles, while the curves for the 2010 and 2015 interval had 
a slight cross in the bottom percentiles. Only the curves for 2005 and 2010 did not cross, suggesting a more 
general inequality reduction in this period. To evaluate the whole 20 years period, we compare the extremes 
1995 and 2015 in Figure 13. The data shows that the Lorenz curve for 2015 is more equal than the 1995 
one in almost all parts of the distribution, except for the very top percentile. 

 

6.  Inequality Indexes and between-within decomposition of Theil 

Tables  6  to  15  (not  presented  in  this  short  version  of  the  paper)  show  the  between-within 
decomposition, for the Theil-T, Theil-L  and J-Divergence indexes, considering the following  groups of 
individual characteristics one at a time: gender (female or male workers), schooling (less than high, high 
school or more than high school), age groups (workers less than 25 years of age, aged 25-35, aged 36-45 
or  older  than  45),  race  (Indigenous,  White,  Black,  Yellow,  Mullato  or  Ignored)  and  region  (North, 
Northeast, Southeast, South or Central-West). In general, the results indicate the predominant role played 
by the “within” component in explaining the total inequality, for the entire historical series of 1994-2015. 
However, looking at the "between" effect for the educational categories, we observe a relatively  higher 
contribution of this attribute.  For instance, in 1994, schooling explained 24.1% (=0.262/1.086) of the total 
inequality measured by the J-Divergence index, while in 2015 this statistic reached 32.8% (=0.273/0.832), 
see Tables 2 and 6. 

We also applied the decomposition of the Theil indexes considering firms' characteristics, such as: 
size (0-4, 5-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-99, 100-249, 250-499, 500-999 and more than 1000 employees), sector of 
activity (Agriculture, Cattle and Fishing; Manufacturing and Extractive; Construction and Infrastructure; 
Commerce, Food and Lodging; Transportation, Communications, Financial; Real State, Defense and Public 
Administration;  Education,  Health  and  Social  Services;  or  Other  Social  Services,  Domestic  Services, 
International Organizations), legal nature of firm (Public; Private; Non Profit; Individuals; International) 
and specific fixed effects of firms.  

Similarly to what we found for several individual workers' characteristics above, the between-within 
decomposition  for  firms'  characteristics  shows  a  predominant  power  of  the  "within"  component  in 

 

7 

determining the total inequality. Nonetheless, when we look at a highly disaggregated level by considering 
a firm fixed effect (i.e., each ﬁrm being a category itself), the results show a remarkable contribution of 
individual firms. For the 1994 to 2015 period, the contribution of firms’ specific factors explained around 
65% of total inequality in each year considered. In 2015, the portion of the total inequality measured by the 
J-Divergence index  explained by the between component reached 64.7% (=0.538/0.83), see Tables 2 and 
14.  

Taken together, our findings suggest that, among several workers' characteristics, the differences in 
schooling between groups were a primary factor in explaining total inequality in the Brazilian formal labor 
market. However, the explanatory power of firms fixed effects is even more pronounced, playing the major 
role in determining labor earnings inequality levels in the Brazilian formal labor market. 

 

 Changes 

When one looks at the changes observed from 1994 to 2015, the explanatory power of  individual 
firms effect to explain the fall of inequality observed is 64.5% (change of between groups 0.5381 – 0.7024 
= -0.1643 over total inequality change -0.2547%), as Table 5 shows. Its last collums are based on the results 
of Tables 6 to 15. Applying the same type of analysis across time to different characteristics, we have also 
found: education (-4.3%), gender (2.55%), age (8.8%)10, macro-region (1.96%), sector of activity (9.92%), 
nature of the firm (-2.61% from 1995 to 2015)11 and firm size (3.06%). The specific firm-effect explains 
around  three  times  more  the  1994  to  2015’s  inequality  fall  than  the  join  gross  contribution  of  all  other 
characteristics considered.  

The other striking result is the increasing impact of education on inequality in this period12. This 
concentration effect disappears if one considers a more recent period of analysis. From 2001 onwards, there 
is  a  clearer  inequality  downward  trend  and  it  may  be  advisable  to  also  consider  this  period.  Education 
explained 33.3% of the marked inequality fall observed assuming the role of the second higher explanatory 
power to explain inequality change (Lam  et al. 2015) . Once  again, specific firm effects explain 75.9% of 
inequality fall occurred between 2001 and 2014. Table 2 also presents the contribution of other variables for 
the 2001-2015 period. 

 

7.  The Contribution of Specific Top Incomes and Educational  Groups 

One  key  advantage  of  the  J-Divergence  is  to  go  beyond  the  between/within  groups  dichotomy, 
allowing to evaluate the role of a specific group in overall inequality. To be sure, by characteristic we mean 
schooling, and by  group we mean those with completed college education, for example.  It includes the 
impact of education premiums paid to those with university degree, their respective share in the population 
but also the level of inequality within groups13. Tables 16 to 24 present the results opened by all groups for 
all socio-demographic and firms related characteristics explored in the paper. 

As we have seen, the main variables that explain formal earnings inequality fall in Brazil during the 
1994 to 2015 period are individual firms, schooling, and age. We focus initially here on the group with 
more than a high school degree. This group explained by itself, in 2015, 48.7% of total inequality while in 

                                                            
10  Ferreira et al. (2014) emphasizes the reduction of age earnings premium using PNAD surveys. 
11 Nature of the firm, that is if a firm is public, private, etc, contributed to a rise of inequality. Courseil et al (2011) 
show  an  increase  of  market  concentration  on  larger  firms  using  RAIS.  Alvarez  et  al.  (2017)  shows  a  growing 
detachment of earnings and productivity distributions in the manufacturing sector. 
12  If we use a finer schooling division with 9 categories, instead of 3 categories, the contribution of education would 
rise less than 3 percentage points in 2015 but the positive impact of education in the 2001 to 2015 period would be 
reverted. Measurement error on personal workers characteristics might influence these results.  
13 If we are interested only in contributions of groups situated in the top part of the income distribution the Theil –T 
could be used as well. The Theil-T presents always positive contributions to those above the mean (Morley 1999; 
Neri and Camargo 1999). 

 

8 

1994 it amounted to 37.6% (Figure 14 and Table 16). That is, there was a relative rise of this category 
relative impact on overall inequality of 29.5% in this period. 

Another application of this J-Divergence property explored here is assessing the role played by top 
income brackets (or individual income of a single person for that matter) in total inequality. According to 
RAIS (Figures 15 and 16 and Table 25 based on Table 24) between 1994 and 2015: i)  the top 10 per cent 
rose their share in total inequality from 49.91% to 59.97%, a 20.2% rise; ii) the top 5 per cent rose their 
share in total inequality from 41.4% to 52.2%, a 26.2% rise; iii) the top 1 per cent’s share rose from 19.28% 
to 27.57%, a 43.1% rise. iv) the top 0.1 per cent’s share rose from 3.74% to 7.13%, a 91% rise. The concern 
with top income shares has been increasing around the World (Piketty 2014). The Brazilian case assessed 
here is curious because it demonstrates that in spite of overall formal earnings inequality fall according to 
most measures there was an increasing concentration at the very upper part of earnings distribution. 

 

8.  Conclusions  

The  assessment  of  income  inequality  normally  uses  household  surveys.  More  recently,  there  was  a 
series of papers based on Personal Income Tax (PIT) records and also combining these two types of data 
sources. However, Brazil also has a long series of establishment level administrative records seldom used 
in distributive studies. The best example of these microdata sets is RAIS (Registro Anual de Informações 
Sociais) source collected by the Labour Ministry with an average of 30 million observations gathered per 
year in the last two decades. 

This note describes the evolution and the close causes of formal earnings inequality in the Brazilian 
formal sector from 1994 and 2015 using RAIS. First, we show that earnings distribution changes observed 
in RAIS reveal a marked inequality fall that is also observed in other more usual measures of inequality 
extracted from household surveys. For example, the Gini of labor earnings in RAIS fell 12.5% between 
1995 and 2015, while  the concentration index obtained with PNAD survey fell 19.3% in the same period.  

Second, unlike other data sources, RAIS does not have top coding, which permits to measure wages at 
the  very  upper  tail  of  earnings  distribution.   The  paper  show  that  in  spite  of  overall  inequality  fall,  the 
monotonic  decrease  of  earnings  increase  goes  until  the  90  percentile  and  raises  specially  above  the  95 
percentile.  This  concentration  increase  goes  in  the  same  direction  as  PIT  based  measures  and  deserves 
further scrutiny. 

Third, we use standard inequality decompositions applied to the J-Divergence index to understand the 
main close determinants of inequality. Schooling sticks out among other characteristics explaining 32.8% 
of total inequality in 2015. The same statistics for individual firms effects reach 64.7%. This means that the 
gross explanatory power of individual firms to explain inequality in the Brazilian formal labor market is 
almost twice the one for education. We also explore the change of inequality where firms appear as the 
main driving variable. 

Finally, the paper also explores J-Divergence properties that allows to see beyond the gross contribution 
of different variables and to capture the relative role played by specific groups. We apply it to isolate the 
role of top incomes. Our results reveals that since 1995 the share of inequality explained by the top 10%, 
1%  and  0.1%  incomes  rose  20.2%,  43.1%  and  91%,  respectively.  Similarly,  in  spite  of  falling  mean 
schooling returns, the share of inequality explained by those with high school diploma rises 29.5% in the 
same period.

Te / T is the Contribution of a certain characteristic to inequality measured by the Theil-T. 

 

Similarly, we can show that the Theil-L can be decomposed as between groups (Le) and within groups 
components: 

where L- =	∑

L = L- +	(cid:16)πℎ	Lℎ

)) 

Hence, J-Divergence can also be expressed in terms of its within and between groups components. 

By its turn each of these components can be expressed in terms of the sum of  Theil-T and Theil-L 
respective components: 

J = 	T- + L- +	(cid:16)Yℎ	Tℎ

The J-Divergence measure allows to gauge the contribution of specific groups of individuals in total 
inequality.  How is it done? In the within and between decomposition formulas for the three information 
theory based inequality indicators above, instead of summing all groups between groups component, we 
instead choose a specific group among k groups and compute its respective contribution from both between 
and within components.  

At  this  point  lies  a  comparative  advantage  of  the  J-Divergence.  As  opposed  to  other  measures 
derived from information theory such as Theil-T and Theil-L, individual’s contribution to this measure is 
always greater or equal to zero. In Figure 17, we see that while the Theil-T receives negative contributions 
from individuals below the mean and the Theil-L receives non-negative contributions for those above the 
mean while in the J-Divergence, these individuals contributions are always non negative. This property 
makes the simple sum of individual divergences equals to total inequality, allowing analyzing the direct 
impact of specific groups’ in inequality. 
 

The Contribution of a Characteristic and Group to Inequality Level (and Growth)  

The contribution of a given characteristic to inequality level and change exemplified initially by the J-
Divergence of a given characteristic is: 

(cid:9)6788	97(cid:11):6(cid:10);<:(cid:10)7(cid:11)		= = =>?/	=? 

@ℎA6-	7B	(cid:9)6788	97(cid:11):6(cid:10);<:(cid:10)7(cid:11)	9ℎA(cid:11)C-	(cid:10)(cid:11)	:7:AD	9ℎA(cid:11)C-	 = ∆(=>?)/	∆(=?)  

where Je = 	T- + L- and  J = 	T + L  
The two equations above says that the relative contribution of a given characteristic – say schooling -  to 
inequality level in  a single point in time (change across time) is  given by  its between component level 
(change) divided by initial total inequality.  Since in the J-Divergence the same additive decomposability 
is applied do specific groups – say individuals with higher education diploma - exactly the same idea can 
also be applied to assess the gross impact of a specific group of a given characteristic to inequality.
