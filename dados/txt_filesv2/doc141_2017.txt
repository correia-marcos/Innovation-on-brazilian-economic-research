Abstract. Corporate ﬁnance theory points out collateral as a contract instrument that reduces asymmetric information
problems and increases value for debtors in default states. During credit expansions, high collateral prices could increase
borrowing capacity of ﬁrms, especially for those that were ﬁnancially constrained before the boom period. In this paper,
we exploit a real estate prices boom during the 2000s in Brazil to study the role of collateral on corporate ﬁnancing and
investment. Our results suggest that the credit boom of the second half of the 2000s alleviated ﬁnancial constraints in
Brazil, especially for small, less tangible publicly traded ﬁrms, ending up to increase corporate investment (weak evidence)
and long term debt ﬁnancing (strong evidence).

1 Introduction

An important topic in ﬁnance research is whether ﬁrm-level ﬁnancial constraints shape corporate investment and how it

interacts with the business cycle (Ersahin & Irani, 2015). Evidence from the global ﬁnancial crisis of 2007-2008 shows that

the credit channel aﬀects ﬁrms according to the extent that they are exposed to the external shock in the credit market

(Almeida et al., 2012), and that constrained ﬁrms are likely to end up cutting investments, selling assets, and bypassing

investment opportunities (Campello et al., 2010). Financial constrained ﬁrms can also impose negative externalities on

its industry peers, thus amplifying economic downturns (Carvalho, 2015). However, little attention has been given to

the opposite side of the story: how does constrained ﬁrms’ investment behaves when access to credit becomes easier in

a poorly developed credit market, and how does it interact with economic expansions? These are questions that, to the

best of our knowledge, are not well answered in the literature.

One important factor that can limit corporate borrowing when ﬁrms have imperfect access to external ﬁnancing is the

value of collateral assets (pledgeable assets). According to (Almeida & Campello, 2007) model, ﬁnancially constrained

ﬁrms could invest below the optimal level because the value of pledgeable assets (such as cash, receivables, inventory,

and net property, plant and equipment - PPENT) does not support enough borrowing. During credit booms, the value

of collateral assets (such as real estate) can increase signiﬁcantly, allowing ﬁrms to borrow a larger amount for further

investment in pledgeable assets. This multiplier eﬀect can integrate credit and economic cycles, amplifying both ﬁrm

ﬁnancing and investment growth.

It is important to note that this theoretical relation between tangibility - proxy for ﬁrms’ collateral assets - and ﬁrm’s

investment is mediated by the ability of ﬁrms to access external ﬁnance, i.e., it should be expected to be meaningful only

to ﬁnancially constrained ﬁrms. If a ﬁrm is ex-ante unconstrained, we should expect no strong response of investment

because these ﬁrms could easily access equity and loan markets even before the structural change in the economy. Changes

in the supply of credit are thus more likely to aﬀect small, cash-ﬂow dependent ﬁrms, whose investment is potentially

limited by the inability of accessing external ﬁnance.

In this paper, we focus on an ex-ante incipient credit market such as Brazil, where most ﬁrms were likely to face severe

credit constraints before the credit deepening process veriﬁed on the late 2000’s (Araujo et al., 2012). Because of the

country’s institutional background, collateral assets assume an important role in shaping bank lending, notably because

of information asymmetry problems that arise from low debtors rights (see, for example, Stiglitz & Weiss, 1981; Hart &

Moore, 1995; Kiyotaki & Moore, 1997). Lower collateral values, such as property, plant, and equipment - pledgeable assets

- can thus limit corporate borrowing, while the credit expansion observed in the country alleviated some of the market

frictions and lead the economy to an “above-trend” growth (Carvalho et al., 2015).

Our identiﬁcation strategy relies on the enactment of the Law 11.101/2005, the “New Bankruptcy Law”, which increased

debtor rights and ﬁrm access to external ﬁnance (Araujo et al., 2012). This regulatory change allows us to use a Diﬀerence-

in-Diﬀerence (DID) methodology to estimate the impact of the law on diﬀerent categories of ﬁrms. Speciﬁcally, we use

this exogenous source of variation in collateral prices to test the theoretical argument exposed by (Almeida & Campello,

2007), which, intuitively, predicts that when ﬁrms have imperfect access to credit (ﬁnancial constraints), changes in ﬁrm’s’

ability to obtain external ﬁnance may also increase investment. One such source of borrowing capacity is the value of

collateral - commonly proxied in the literature by assets tangibility. By mitigating contractibility problems, we should

2

expect a larger eﬀect of collateral prices on external ﬁnance access on countries where debtors are not well protected, such

as Brazil . Debt collateral is one of the most common enforcement instruments used around the world. In a state of nature

where the borrowing ﬁrm defaults, lender collateral gives the ability to the lender to seize tangible assets belonging to the

debtor (Araujo et al., 2012)

To sort ﬁrms on ﬁnancial constrained and unconstrained groups, we consider the recent Farre-Mensa & Ljungqvist

(2016) critique. While some classical measures of ﬁnancial constraints are still used in the literature of ﬁnancial constraints

(payout ratio, total assets, bond ratings, Kaplan and Zingales’ and other indexes, etc.), this paper puts serious doubts

on what these variables really measure. The authors ﬁnd that these measures usually fail in classifying ﬁrms that are

plausibly constrained, both in debt markets (using natural experiments of 43 staggered increases in corporate income

taxes triggered by individual US States) and equity markets (analyzing “equity recycling1” on ﬁrms). For each of ﬁve

standard constraints measures, they ﬁnd that the average “constrained” ﬁrm is able to borrow more in response to an

increase in state corporate income tax rates and to simultaneously raise equity and increase payouts to shareholders. The

authors conclude that these measures could be identifying young and fast-growing ﬁrms, rather than capturing ﬁnancial

constraints. Considering their critique, we choose to use ﬁrms? total asset as our sorting criteria for ﬁnancial constraints,

which is also consistent with prior studies in the literature (see, for example, Kirch et al., 2014).

Our results show that following the enactment of the New Bankruptcy Law, real estate prices and overall credit in

Brazil indeed started to rise faster. For ﬁnancially constrained ﬁrms (bottom 40% of Total Assets, in each year of our

sample), we estimate that the low-tangibility group (bottom 40% of its industry ﬁxed assets / total assets) increased

investment around 3.0 percentage points (p.p.) more than the high-tangibility group (top 40% of its industry ﬁxed assets

/ total assets), comparing means before (2002-2004) and after (2005-2008) the exogenous change in collateral prices. We

show that this eﬀect is even stronger for ﬁrm ﬁnancing: the average ﬁrm in the low-tangibility group increased total debt

/ total assets around 6.6 p.p. more than the average ﬁrm belonging to the high-tangibility group, and this diﬀerence

is statistically signiﬁcant at 5%. Finally, this leverage eﬀects on low-tangibility ﬁrms are focused on and increase on

long-term debt (debt maturing in one year or after), since the low-tangibility group increased the share of long-term debt

on total debt around 11.6 p.p. then the high-tangibility group, and this is statistically signiﬁcant at 1%.

Taken together, our results suggest that the credit boom of the second half of the 2000s alleviated ﬁnancial constraints

in Brazil, especially for smaller, less tangible publicly traded ﬁrms, ending up to increase long-term ﬁnancing and boosting

corporate investment. Although we ﬁnd consistent evidence for the multiplier eﬀect exposed in Almeida & Campello

(2007), our results suggest a primary role of banks alleviating collateral requirements, potentially because of the higher

supply of credit and better growth opportunities in the economy. In this sense, our evidence supports the idea that the

relaxing collateral requirements dominated the multiplier eﬀect during the 2000s credit expansion in Brazil.

Our research connects to at least two research topics. Empirical evidence on the determinants of leverage (Frank &

Goyal, 2009; Harris & Raviv, 1991; Masulis & Trueman, 1988; Titman & Wessels, 1988) support the idea that ﬁrms that

produce steady cash ﬂows and have easily redeployable assets that can be pledged as collateral can aﬀord high debt-equity

ratios. In contrast, risky ﬁrms with little current cash ﬂows and ﬁrms with intangible assets (e.g., R&D and advertising)

tend to have low leverage. Our evidence suggests that this wedge can be tightened with credit rights reforms that increase

collateral values and access to credit.

1Grullon et al. (2011) deﬁnes equity recycling as the tendency of ﬁrms to pay out and raise equity simultaneously.

3

Our results are also related to policy experiments using a tax rate reduction in favor of small and medium-sized ﬁrms.

A recent study on French companies also supports the idea that ﬁnancial constraints decrease in ﬁrm size, as capital

accumulation grew more in more productive, small ﬁrms aﬀected by the reform (Bernini et al., 2016). Other recent

research shows that a within-ﬁrm change in ﬁnancial constraints can also aﬀect export value, as ﬁnancially constrained

ﬁrms reduce their export by 35% relative to ﬁnancially unconstrained ones (Secchi et al., 2014). Our study suggests that

smaller, less tangible ﬁrms are also beneﬁted from a legal reform that strengthened debtor rights in a previously opaque

credit market, such as Brazil before 2005.

The rest of the paper is described as follow. In section 2 we discuss the role of collateral in corporate ﬁnance, and why

it matters especially for emerging economies. In section 3 we describe the credit cycle of the 2000’s in Brazil and also

its reﬂects on the value of typically used collateral, such as real estate. In section 4, we describe the data and method

that we use. Finally, in section 5, we summarize our results and its main implications on both micro and macroeconomic

perspectives, and then we conclude the paper in section 6.

2 The role of collateral on corporate ﬁnancing and investment

Academic studies about the relationship between investment decisions and funding constraints begin with the paper of

Fazzari et al. (1988). In this study, the authors propose that in the case of ﬁrms facing funding constraints, investment

decisions are related to the availability of internal resources, and not just the availability of proﬁtable investment opportu-

nities. The study shows, from positive and signiﬁcant coeﬃcients, the relationship between investment, as the dependent

variable, and current and lagged cash ﬂow as independent variables. Note the fact that the cash ﬂow displays explanatory

power higher than Tobin’s Q. The authors end up validating the hypothesis that the importance of cash ﬂow on the

resources invested is higher in companies with low-proﬁt distribution of dividend.

Since the publication of this study, the theme has been consolidated as one of the most important research topics in

ﬁnancial economics, gaining emphasis in academia through publications both in the international (Kaplan & Zingales,

1997; Cleary, 1999; Almeida et al., 2004; Cleary, 2005; Cleary et al., 2007; Almeida & Campello, 2007; Ersahin & Irani,

2015, among others) and national literature (see, for example, Terra, 2003; Kirch et al., 2014).

Our research, however, is marked out in the model presented by Almeida & Campello (2007). Assuming that imper-

fections and information asymmetries restrict the ability of ﬁrms to take resources and, consequently, to invest, factors

that minimize these issues would eventually facilitate their access to lending resources, loosening this restriction. Thus,

the authors began to consider the tangible assets subject to garnishment, facilitating access to credit, whereas a larger

share of tangible assets would be perceived as an increase in available collateral of the company, making potential funding

providers more likely to grant credit to the company. In turn, access to credit would allow greater investment condition

in new tangible assets, which could allow new funding and so on. Companies without credit restriction, however, would

not be or would be little aﬀected by asset tangibility.

2.1 Pledgeable income and its link with collateral

A prospective borrower faces a number of choices. One of them refers to the contract’s guarantees - it can be unsecured

(lender lending “against cash ﬂow”) or secured debt (lenders are lending “against assets”). Pledging assets as collateral

4

is an important instrument to mitigate moral hazard problems and thus reduce interest rates. The model of Almeida &

Campello (2007) shows that the value of pledgeable assets can bind ﬁrm investment for ﬁnancially constrained ﬁrms.

The model stipulated by Almeida & Campello (2007) assumes presented by Hart & Moore (1995) that human capital

can not be alienable, which allows deriving the implication that the attachable assets of the company are limited, as well

cash ﬂow for investments. The economy has two periods, 0 and 1, and the period 0, the company needs to access a

particular production technology f (I), which will generate output in time 1. It is assumed a ratio of external ﬁnancing

(B) to make the project viable. As lenders have no control over the return of the project, it is quite common that start to

limit their exposure to the ﬁrm value in liquidation, which may be associated with the collateral of the loan agreements.

Thus, the resource to be captured (B) shall be limited by the tangibility degree (τ ) of Investment (I):

B ≤ τ I

(1)

In addition to the funds raised, the company may also have own resources (W ) that can be used to ﬁnance investment

(I). Like this:

The optimal level of investment (I F B), such that f(cid:0)I F B(cid:1) = 1. If no restriction between own resources and funds
raised, the company will be satisfying I F B. However, investment is limited(cid:0)I∗ < I F B(cid:1), when:

I ≤ W + τ I

(2)

If the ﬁrm’s resources are limited, the level of investment is determined by the available budget. Thus, the optimal

investment level is given by:

τ < τ∗(cid:0)W, I F B(cid:1) = max

The sensitivity of investment to cash ﬂow is given by:

(4)

(5)

Where the sensitivity of investment to cash ﬂow is increasing as the degree of tangibility on investment. However, with

a high degree of tangibility enough, the investment can become disconnected from the company’s cash ﬂow, as well as the

degree of tangibility will not impact on the sensitivity of the investment in case of no credit restriction companies.

In this sense, Almeida & Campello (2007) present the following proposition:

Proposition (Almeida & Campelo, 2007). The cash ﬂow sensitivity of investment,

with asset tangibility:

i) At low levels of tangibility, τ < τ∗(cid:0)W, I F B(cid:1), the ﬁrm is ﬁnancially constrained and
ii) At high levels of tangibility , τ ≥ τ∗(cid:0)W, I F B(cid:1), the ﬁrm is ﬁnancially unconstrained and

(6)

Analyzing the behavior of companies during the period 1971-2000, the study found that a higher tangibility of company

assets reduces the possibility of ﬁnancial constraint, validating the idea that the positive eﬀect of cash ﬂow on investment

grows with reducing the degree of asset tangibility.

In practice, the estimates obtained positive and signiﬁcant coeﬃ-

cients for the relationship whit constrained ﬁrms and low coeﬃcients and, in most cases, not signiﬁcant in the case of

unconstrained ﬁrms.

Still in Almeida & Campello (2007) analysis, evaluated the credit multiplier as a driving relationship between tangibility

mechanism of assets and sensitivity of investment to cash ﬂow. With the change in asset prices over time, the credit oﬀer

ends ranging jointly, given the movements of the collateral value. Thus, the tangibility eﬀect on companies in the investment

sensitivity to cash ﬂow being expanded during periods of economic boom, when the valued assets serve as collateral for

making capabilities that will serve to further investment in assets. In times of economic recession, with falling asset prices,

companies end up having less sizable assets, which generates fewer guarantees for new lines of credit, containing credit for

new investments. The study proves that this credit multiplier has ﬁrst-order eﬀect on companies’ investment decisions.

2.2 Non-collateral debt ﬁnancing: lending on cash

In a perfect market, according to the theory proposed by Modigliani & Miller (1958), investment decisions would merely

be aﬀected by the investment opportunities of ﬁrms, since the resources would be optimally used and all credit demand

would be supplied by supply.

In this context, collateral assets are not relevant because interest rates would clear the

market, even in the presence of bankruptcy risk.

In the real world, however, market incompleteness and asymmetric information can lead the economy to a credit

rationing situation (Stiglitz & Weiss, 1981): adverse selection, moral hazard, and limited enforcement in case of default

cause the exclusion of some individuals on the market, even if they are willing to pay the market value of lending.

Asymmetric information about ﬁrms’ prospects between insiders and outsiders (potential investors) can create a subs-

tantial cost diﬀerential between internal and external funds (Myers & Majluf, 1984; Greenwald et al., 1984, ,and so on).

The break-even q value for a new investment project is higher than unity (1 + Ω > 1), where Ω is the premium necessary

to compensate new investors for the risk of investing inadvertently in lemons2 (Fazzari et al., 1988). Given this context,

this asymmetric information causes “credit rationing” for some borrowers (Stiglitz & Weiss, 1981).

To minimize this uncertainty, lenders seek to avoid purely loans based on cash ﬂow and not backed by assets, that

is when the expectation of receiving the money back is purely based on the assessment that the borrower will be able

to generate enough cash ﬂow. In the case of default, the lenders can not repossess (seize) speciﬁed assets. In this case,

ﬁrms can be credit rationed if they do not have enough pledgeable assets to get credit, and Tirole (2010) establishes the

following hypothesis, which we will take to our study:

2Some papers in corporate ﬁnance adopted the term “lemon”, originally proposed by Akerlof (1970), to describe bad type ﬁrms.

H1: Credit rationing is more binding for ﬁrms with less tangible assets or assets that have a lower value in liquidation
(Tirole, 2010).

3 Credit cycles and collateral prices in Brazil

3.1 Credit evolution in Brazil

With the implementation of the Real Plan, in 1994, and the consequent economic stabilization from the control of inﬂation,

Brazil opened space for the growth of the loan portfolio, which subsequently sustain economic growth cycle early 2000.

Initially, however, restructuring programs of the ﬁnancial system, such as PROER - Incentive Program for Recovery and

Strengthening of the National ﬁnancial system, PROES - Incentive Program for the Reduction of the State Public Sector

in Banking and PROEF - Strengthening Program Federal Financial Institutions, eventually leading to a credit retraction,

which fell from 34% of GDP in December 1995 to 26% of GDP in December 2002 (Mora, 2014).

As can be seen in Figure 1, the credit expansion cycle started with the acceleration of applications with funding of free

resources, to the detriment of earmarked resources that little grew during this period from 2002 to 2008 and only from

2009 it began to have signiﬁcant growth rates. From observation of the division between funds invested in Individual and

Corporations related applications with free funds, we can check that, given the optimistic expectations of a recovery in

employment and household income, the initial growth happens in the Individuals segment, passing from 6.1% in 2002 to

13% in 2008. Meanwhile, credit to companies remained stagnant until 2005, starting their growth cycle from 2006 and

reaching 15.7% of GDP in 2008.

Tabela 1: Relation between credit and GDP: Period 2002-2008

Note: This table presents the evolution of diﬀerent credit operations in the Brazilian Financial System, as reported by the Brazilian
Central Bank (BCB). Earnmarked funds refer to ﬁnancing regulated by National Monetary Council (CMN) or linked to earmarked
resources, mainly destined to housing, rural and infrastructure sectors. Non-earnmarked refers to ﬁnancing and loans which rates are
freely negotiated between ﬁnancial institutions and borrowers, i.e., market rates. In non-earmarked operations, ﬁnancial institutions have
autonomy to decide loans destination. We also use BCB’s classiﬁcation of outstanding credit according to the type of customer (non-
ﬁnancial corporations - Corporations - and households - Individuals). Finally, we separate banks in public and private, and the latter in
national and foreign, depending on the ownership.

Still based in Figure 1, it is possible to observe that growth is sustained by the appetite of private institutions, and

more speciﬁcally, by national capital banks. These institutions, which had a portfolio of 16.3% to GDP in 2002, increased

7

a portfolio of credit amounted to 25.8% of GDP in 2008. Although public banks have very signiﬁcant participation in the

current context in Brazil, the growth of these occurs in the period following analyzed here, that is from 2009.

Thus, the loan portfolio, which represented 26% of GDP in December 2002, showed broad growth, reaching, according

to Central Bank data (Table 1), 40.5% of GDP in December 2008.However, even after this large growth, the credit

portfolio in Brazil still represented a low ratio to GDP compared the world’s major economies. According to the Financial

Development and Structure Dataset World Bank, presented in Table 2, the credit / GDP ratio, which was 28.24% in 2002,

reached 47.67% in 2008, while reached 195.58% in the United States and even in developing economies such as China and

South Africa already was 96.36% and 148.18%, respectively.

Figura 1: Domestic Credit to Private Sector by Country - 2002 and 2008

Sant’anna et al. (1994) also point out that the expansion of credit between 2004 and 2008 was accompanied by a major

change in market proﬁle both with respect to the extension of deadlines as regarding the fall in interest rates. According

to Central Bank data, the average term of the loans, which was 222 calendar days in January 2004, spent 379 days in

December 2008, an increase of 70.6% over a period of ﬁve years. In turn, the interest rate, which revolved at a level of

45% from 2004 to 2006, came to about 35% between 2007 and 2008.

In Figure 2, we show the Credit-GDP ratop evolution from 1996m3 to 2016m3. Visual analysis suggest that credit

growth changed its slope in 2004/2005, following an expansionary economic period of that last 61 months.3.

3.2 Collateral prices in Brazil

To evaluate the time series of pleadgeable assets’ price in Brazil, we analyze the Residential Real Estate Collateral Value

Index (IVG-R). This index is released by the Brazilian Central Bank and it is calculated with data extracted from the

SCR real estate loans to households. This data comprise loans in which the collateral is composed of liens on residential

real estate or real estate mortgage. The value of each property backed as collateral is estimated at the time of the granting

of credit.

The IVG-R considers the assessed value of the properties pledged as collateral for loans in a given month, from a

sample of about 160 thousand households. The collection is made up of properties located in the eleven metropolitan

3This is the largest expansionary period dated in Brazil since data is available (1980). An average expansionary period lasts 28.7 months,

while an average recession lasts 15.8 months (CODACE, 2010)

As Figure 3 shows, starting on 2005, we can observe an expansion period on the growth of assets value used as collateral

on domestic lending. This acceleration in the growth rate of asset prices occurs exactly in the same period that credit

growth accelerated, as seen in the previous session. This increasing value on this type of assets can aﬀect corporate

investment through the credit multiplier, as the larger value of pledgeable assets would allow greater access to credit.

With more access to credit, companies can execute new investment projects, which generates more pledgeable assets.4

4.1 Deﬁnition of tangibility and investment

Deﬁning asset tangibility is not an easy task. Most countries allow secured debt transactions involving “immovable assets”

(eg., land and buildings), while “movable assets” (like machinery and equipment) comprise about half of total ﬁxed assets

around the world (Alvarez de la Campa, 2011). We built our baseline measure of tangibility based on the most used proxy

in the literature (see, for example, Vig, 2013; Campello & Larrain, 2016), the ratio of total ﬁxed assets (net property,
plant and equipment − “movable” + “immovable” assets) to total assets.5

Tangibility =

Fixed Assets
Total Assets

(7)

Almeida & Campello (2007) use three diﬀerent measures of tangibility. One is based on a ﬁrm-level measure of expected

liquidation values according to Berger et al. (1996). Using data from the proceeds of discontinued operations reported

by a sample of Compustat ﬁrms over the 1984-1993 period, this empirical paper ﬁnds that a dollar of book value yields,

on average, to a 72 cents in exit value for receivables, 55 cents for inventory, and 54 cents for ﬁxed assets. Almeida &

Campello (2007) use these coeﬃcients to estimate a ﬁrm-level and time variant “liquidation value”:

Tangibility2 = 0.715 · Receivables + 0.547 · Inventory + 0.535 · Capital

(8)

The second measure of asset tangibility used by Almeida & Campello (2007) is based on the high-cyclicality of durable

goods industry sales. They use a durable/nondurable industry dichotomy to create a measure of assets redeployability, i.e.,

the extent to which an asset can be (easily or not) sold in the secondary market. The authors include all durable goods

industries (except SICs 32 and 38) plus SIC 30, that are assigned with value “1”, and “0” otherwise (all other industries -

non-durable). Their motivation is that assets of ﬁrms operating in non-durables industries are perceived as more liquid

by lenders.

In this study, we use in our baseline regressions the Campello & Larrain (2016) measure of tangibility (Equation (7)),

since we are interested in the value increasing of real estate assets (immovable assets) and not in other ﬁnancial items that

can be pledged as collateral, such as receivables or inventory. However, we keep in mind that we have diﬀerent measures

of tangibility available in the literature.

Our core investment variable is based on Almeida & Campello (2007) and Kirch et al. (2014): Investment equal to

the ratio between capital expenditures and lagged capital stock (PPENT). We also consider an alternative measure of

investment based on Campello & Larrain (2016): the change in ﬁxed assets scaled by lagged ﬁxed assets. Since these

variables are highly correlated, we use in our baseline the regressions of the ﬁrst investment deﬁnition.

4.2 Data and sample

We start our database collecting Compustat Global Annual Fundamental data for Brazilian publicly traded companies’

balance sheet. In order to match this ﬁnancial data with stock price information, we merge the Compustat dataset with

the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP)’s daily price securities, using Global Company Key (GVKEY) and

higher prices of collateral could amplifying corporate investment growth.

5Although Campello & Larrain (2016) also calculate tangibility for U.S. ﬁrms using ”movable”and ”immovable”assets separately, Compustat

Global does not comprise this information about the individual components of ﬁxed assets outside the U.S.

10

ﬁscal year as matching variables. The price information we import from the CRSP database is the average price of each

ﬁrm’s stock in a given year. To guarantee that we would lose the minimum number of observations during the matching

procedure, we do not impose a minimum number of trading days for each stock in the CRSP database6.

We also collect aggregate credit information and the Residential Real State Collateral Value Index from Central Bank

of Brazil (Central Bank Time Series Management System). Our sample period surrounds the New Bankruptcy Law in

Brazil (Law 11,101/2005), going three years forward and three years backward (i.e., 2002-2008). To mitigate the inﬂuence

of outliers, we winsorize each continum variable in the 5% and 95% trasholds, respectivelly. Following this procedure,

we drop ﬁrms that did not have at least two year-observations during the period 2002-2008. We also follow Almeida &

Campello (2007) and Kirch et al. (2014) and drop observations (ﬁrm-year) that: a) had property, plant and equipment

(PPENT) lower than R$5 million, in values of July 2016;7 b) had asset growth in the year higher than 100%, which

typically occurs when ﬁrms is involved in mergers and acquisitions (M&A activities); c) were outside the 2 digit SIC range

20-39, that represents manufacturing ﬁrms8.

Our ﬁnal sample comprises 1,473 ﬁrm-year observations (Table 2), divided in ”Constrained” and ”Unconstrained”

subsamples:

if a ﬁrm in a given year belongs to the top 40% of total assets in its industry (SIC 2 digits), then it is

considered unconstrained; and constrained if in the bottom 40%. We use this criterion to separate ﬁrms that potentially

face low ﬁnancial frictions (large ﬁrms) from those that faces higher ﬁnancial frictions (small and medium ﬁrms), which is

consistent with the criteria used in Almeida & Campello (2007) and Kirch et al. (2014).

Table 2 shows that our sample has a suﬃciently large number of high and low-tangibility ﬁrms in most of the ma-

nufacturing sector. We have a larger fraction of ﬁrms from Chemicals and Allied Products (12.2%), Food and Kindred

Products (11.8%), and Primary Metal Industries (11.0%). Industries that had not at least three ﬁrms in the sample were

dropped from the sample.

4.3 Model Speciﬁcation

To quantify the eﬀect of collateral prices on ﬁrm outcomes, we start by estimating a standard diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences

speciﬁcation using the validity of the law number 11,001/2005, the ”Bankruptcy Law”, as an exogenous variation in the

price of collateral:

Yis,t = αi + αt + β1 · Postt + β2 · High Tangibilityis + β3 · (Postt × High Tangibilityis) + εis,t

(9)

Where Yis,t represents the outcome of interest (Debt/Total Assets, Long-Term Debt/Total Debt, and Investment/Total

Assets), High Tangibilityis is a dummy variable that equals one if the ﬁrm is in the top 40% of its industry’s tangibility

(Fixed Assets/Total Assets) distribution, and zero if it is in the bottom 40%; Postt is a dummy variable that equals one

if in the year 2005 or after (this period is determined by the Brazilian New Bankruptcy Law - Law n. 11,101, passed

on congress on February 9th, 2005 and took eﬀect three months after) and 0 in years before 2005; to control for ﬁrms’

time-invariant characteristics we include a full set of ﬁrm ﬁxed eﬀects (αi), as well as year ﬁxed eﬀects (αt) to control for

6Even though to calculate the average year price we do not consider missing observations, after the merging process we ended up losing 101
companies (ﬁrms for which there was no price or information on the number shares available on the CRSP database). Because our sample is
already relatively small, we decided to use the non-merged database in our baseline regressions, using market information such as Tobin’s Q
only in robustness checks.

7We inﬂate all continuous variables to July 2016 through the national Consumer Price Index - IPCA.
8We therefore excludes of the sample ﬁrms from the agriculture sector, mining, and also services, such as those ﬁrms from the ﬁnancial

industry, typically excluded in empirical corporate ﬁnance studies because of its singularities in capital structure and other ﬁnancial aspects.

time-varying economic shocks. Finally, εis,t is the error term, with standard errors clustered at the ﬁrm level (following

Petersen, 2009). Our coeﬃcient of interest is β3, which measures the pre-post diﬀerence in the outcome of ﬁrms belonging

to the high tangibility group, relative to the pre-post diﬀerence of ﬁrms in the low tangibility group.

Equation 10 estimates the DID controlling for ﬁrms and year ﬁxed eﬀects, however, it does not control for other ﬁrm

and industry characteristics that can simultaneously aﬀect the outcome of interest. To deal with that, we include in

Equation 10 a set of control variables, with turns our DID equation similar to Campello & Larrain (2016):

Yis,t = αi + αt + β · (Postt × High Tangibilityis) + γXis,t + εis,t

(10)

where Xis,t is a vector of ﬁrm-level controls that include size, proﬁtability, leverage, and overall tangibility. We use

speciﬁcations (9) and (10) in the main empirical results of the paper.

5 Results

5.1 Descriptive statistics

Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics by ﬁnancial constraint status. Numbers referrers to constrained (Panel A),

unconstrained (Panel B) and all ﬁrms in the sample (Panel C). As previously stated, the separation of constrained and

unconstrained ﬁrms is due to within industry total assets (ﬁrm size). For this reason, average constrained ﬁrm’ size (LN

Total Assets = 5.15) is lower than the average non-constrained ﬁrms’ size (LN Total Assets = 7.51), even though ﬁrms

are in the same industry.

The investment of the two groups has a sensible diﬀerence. While the group of constrained ﬁrms presents investment

of 17% of lagged ﬁxed assets, the group of unconstrained ﬁrms features 21% of lagged ﬁxed assets, a diﬀerence of 4% of

assets, and the group formed by all companies obtained an average of 19% of ﬁxed assets. Likewise, the median of the

unconstrained group (0.11) was also lower than the unconstrained group (0.16).

Regarding the tangibility, we calculate two measures, namely the relationship between ﬁxed assets and total assets

(Tangility1) and the ratio of the sum of cash, accounts receivable, inventories, and ﬁxed capital to total assets (Tangibility2).

The results of the two groups were very similar, being that the group of constrained ﬁrms (0.40) obtained Tangibility1

13

slightly higher than the group of unconstrained ﬁrms (0.38), while the unrestricted group (0.82) obtained Tangibility2

slightly higher than constrained group (0.80).

With regard to debt, the group of constrained ﬁrms showed more debt in relation to total assets, with an index of 0.59

compared to 0.31 of the group of unconstrained ﬁrms and 0.45 for the whole group. Interesting to note that in the period,

the average change in debt was 0.15 for constrained ﬁrms against 0.03 of unconstrained companies, clearly demonstrating

that companies of the ﬁrst group contracted more debt than the second. Similarly, the group of unconstrained ﬁrms

demonstrated to maintain a higher cash with an index of 0.13 against 0.08 of constrained ﬁrms.

In turn, with respect to the debt proﬁle, we found that constrained ﬁrms had the most concentrated debt in the short

term than the unconstrained ﬁrms. The ﬁrst group had 61% of the debt in the short term and 39% long term, while the

second got 47% in the short term and 53% long term.

5.2 Firms’ heterogeneity in tangibility

Figure 4 shows the cross-sectional variation of our baseline tangibility measure for the whole sample of ﬁrms, by year and

just before the implementation of the “New Bankruptcy Law” in Brazil, that triggered the expansion cycle on credit and

real estate prices. Figure 3a shows that the variation on ﬁrms’ tangibility is observed across the years. Moreover, Figure

3b reveals that there is both a substantial degree of cross-sectoral variation on the average ﬁrm tangibility (SIC 2 Digits

on manufacturing ﬁrms) and of cross-sectional variation on ﬁrms belonging to a given industry (similar pattern are found

in East European countries, as shown in Campello & Larrain (2016)).

Figura 4: Tangibility (Fixed assets / total assets) distribution, by year and by industry (sic 2 digits)

(a) Tangibility variability - By year

(b) Tangibility variability - By industry

This observed cross-sectional variation in ﬁrms’ tangibility within industries is crucial to our empirical strategy. By

focusing on the high and bottom fraction of tangibility in ﬁrm-industry groups, our approach requires enough cross-sectional

variation in the tangibility. By doing so, our goal is to control for common industry shocks that aﬀect ﬁrms in a given

industry, but that can be very diﬀerent from industry to industry. For example, Brazilian food industry (SIC2=20) have

beneﬁted from both increasing local private consumption and increasing foreign demand for these goods, such as poultry

meat, industrialized soy products, among others. However, other industries did not have the same positive macroeconomic

shocks: Tobacco products (SIC2=21), for example, was prejudiced by the imposition of increasing restrictions on tobacco

In other words, by focusing on ﬁrms with diﬀerent tangibility in the same economic activity (industry), we

control for speciﬁc industry shocks.

We highlight in Figure 4(b) two ﬁrms that are very similar in its activities and mix of products: Cafe Sol´uvel Brasilia

S/A and Cia Cacique de Cafe Soluvel. Both are coﬀee producers, which is an important item in the Brazilian food industry.

We can plausibly argue that both ﬁrms are exposed to the same macroeconomic and investment opportunities shocks.

However, one ﬁrm had in 2005 a ﬁxed assets / total assets very diﬀerent from the other. We explore these diﬀerences in

the potential use of collateral to access external ﬁnance across companies to estimate the eﬀect of the booming collateral

prices on debt ﬁnancing and investment.

5.3 Are there diﬀerences in investment and ﬁrm ﬁnancing between the two groups?

Exploiting the observed cross-section variability in tangibility, we analyze mean and median of our three independent

variables (investment, debt / total assets, and long-term debt - total debt), by period (before and after the expansion

credit cycle) and by group (low vs high-tangibility). In Figure 5, we show the evolution of these variables between the

high and low-tangibility groups.

The graphical evidence suggests that the low-tangibility group increased more than proportionally its investment, total

debt and long-term debt / total debt after 2005. If we look at the numbers (Table 4), we can see that the post-pre diﬀerence

in investment is 5.3 p.p. and 8.3 p.p.

for the high and low-tangibility ﬁrms, respectively. The t-test for diﬀerences of

means conﬁrms that these diﬀerences are statistically signiﬁcant at 1%. However, when we look at the diﬀerence of the

diﬀerences (row and column ”Diﬀerence”of Panels A, B and C in Table 4), we conclude that the control group (low-tang)

increased its investment 3.0 p.p. more than the treatment group (high-tang). This diﬀerence is economically relevant

(around 17.7% considering the pre-event investment mean of the low-tang group) albeit not statistically diﬀerent of zero

by the standard t-test. We ﬁnd more prominent results in total debt (Panel B), where the control group increased in 6.6

p.p. its total debt -total assets ratio relative to the treatment group. This diﬀerence is statistically signiﬁcant (5%) and

economic sizeable: a 27% increase in leverage considering the pre-treatment level of the control group.

One could also note that we ﬁnd the larger diﬀerence between the two groups in the composition of debt. Before 2005,

the average ﬁrm in the high-tangibility group had 43.2% of its debt in long-term debt (LTD). Meanwhile, the average

low-tangibility ﬁrm had only 34.7% of its debt in LTD. After the bankruptcy law and the expansion cycle in the credit

market, the former ﬁrms seem to have beneﬁted the most of this new macroeconomic environment: a meaningful increase

of 11.6 p.p. (33% of the pre-event average) relative to the high-tangibility group. This empirical evidence is particularly

important because it implies one heterogeneous eﬀect of the credit cycle on Brazilian ﬁrms: less tangible ﬁrms, potentially

facing more ﬁnancial frictions before the credit boom, eﬀectively increased its long-term debt, which interest rates are

normally lower and the higher maturity allows the ﬁrm to best manage its investment decisions over the business cycle.

5.4 Discussion of results

Our study starts from the division of the ﬁrms into two groups (ﬁnancial constrained and ﬁnancial unconstrained) according

asset size criterion. From these groups we distinguish the ﬁrst results, which include: (i) companies constrained had

investment level lower than the unconstrained, validating anticipated by the literature (Kirch et al., 2014; Bernini et al.,

2016); (ii) the two groups showed similar degree of tangibility; (iii) the ﬁnancial constrained ﬁrms had concentrated debt

15

Figura 5: Mean and median of our core independent variables, by year and by low-high tangibility groups

in the short term, while ﬁnancial unconstrained ﬁrms had most of the long-term debt; (iv) the ﬁnancial constrained

ﬁrms presented a debt evolution much higher that the unconstrained ﬁrms. Regarding this last item, we understood that

constrained ﬁrm, which had very little access to credit in the initial period, have access to credit easier from the credit

expansion. Although this issue draws attention, it corroborates with results of others studies. In evaluating Mexico’s

industrial sector from 1984 to 1994, the authors found that, over a period of credit expansion, ﬁnancial constraints appear

to have been eased especially for smaller ﬁrms (Gelos & Werner, 2002). The same results were founded by Bernini et al.

(2016) evaluating the ﬁnancial market French.

Later, in our sample of ﬁnancially constrained ﬁrms (bottom 40% of Total Assets, in each year of our sample) we ﬁnd

by the eﬀectiveness of the Law 11,101/2005, the “New Bankruptcy Law” (it started to vigorate in Brazil by May 12th, 2005). Therefore,
After refers to the period 2005 to 2008 and Before refers to the period 2002 to 2004. In all Panels, we calculate the average of each referred
variable pre and post-law, i.e., we have the averages Before and After the event. Each Panel refers to a diﬀerent dependent variable, as
described above. The diﬀerence in diﬀerences in each Panel is the variable of interest. ∗∗∗, ∗∗, and ∗ implies signiﬁcance at the 99%, 95%
and 90% levels, respectively.

that the low-tangibility group (bottom 40% of its industry ﬁxed assets / Total assets) increased investment around 3.0

percentage points (pp) more than the high-tangibility group (top 40% of its industry ﬁxed assets / Total assets), comparing

means before (2002-2004) and after (2005-2008) the credit expansion cycle. This variation is meaningful economic: 17%

Increase in investment for the low-tangibility group relative to the high-tangibility group, considering the pre-event mean

(17.7%).

Although some evidence is shown that the credit boom facilitated investment for ﬁrms with a low fraction of pledgeable

assets, our results are stronger (statistically and economically) for ﬁrm ﬁnancing. The average ﬁrm in the low-tangibility

group increased total debt / total assets around 6.6 p.p. more (27% of increase considering the pre-event average) than

the average ﬁrm belonging to the high-tangibility group, and this diﬀerence is also statistically signiﬁcant (5%). This

result suggests that collateral played a major role in ﬁrms access to debt before the credit expansion, and that the higher

supply of credit that followed the New Bankruptcy Law allowed less tangible ﬁrms to increase access credit markets.

Besides the increase in total debt, an important ﬁnding of our empirical estimations is that the composition of debt

changed signiﬁcantly more to the low-tangibility group. The average low-tangibility ﬁrm increased the share of long-term

debt on total debt after 2005 around 11.6 p.p.

(33%) more relative to an average high-tangibility ﬁrm. More than

statistically signiﬁcant (1%), this result is economically sizable: a 1/3 increase in the fraction of long-term debt on total

debt to low-tangibility ﬁrms relative to high-tangibility ﬁrms after 2005 indicates a qualitatively meaningful improvement

on the access of corporate credit in Brazil, especially for ﬁrms that were potentially out of the market before the credit

expansion cycle.

In summary, our study points to an easier access to credit for low-tangibility ﬁrms, which enabled the increasing the

17

investment of this group’s ﬁrms. This result ends up supporting the idea Guermazi (2014), who evaluated the credit

expansion in Tunisia over the period of ﬁnancial liberalization, for 1999 to 2005, and found that, although the tangibility

of assets play an important role in the investment behavior of companies, the sensitivity of investment in relation to

tangibility lost strength over the credit boom. On the other hand, such a conclusion is not deﬁnitive, and studies such

as Gelos & Werner (2002) found that the importance of collateral in the credit decision did not reduce over the credit

expansion in the period evaluated in the Mexican market.

6 Conclusion

Our macro evidence shows that following the enactment of the New Bankruptcy Law (Law n. 11.101/2005), real estate

prices and overall credit in Brazil indeed started to rise faster, especially to individuals. We exploit this new expansion

cycle in both credit and real estate prices to estimate how ﬁrms’ ﬁnancing and investment reacted to this new economic

environment. We sort ﬁrms accordingly to its ex-ante likelihood on being ﬁnancially constrained, i.e., the extent to which a

given ﬁrm faces diﬃculties to raise external ﬁnance. We than compare how ﬁrm ﬁnancing and investment behaves relative

to a counterfactual ﬁrm in the same industry (SIC 2 digits), in order to control for industry speciﬁc economic shocks.

In our sample of ﬁnancially constrained ﬁrms (bottom 70% of Total Assets, in each year of our sample) we ﬁnd that the

low-tangibility group (bottom 40% of its industry ﬁxed assets / total assets) increased investment around 3.0 percentage

points (p.p.) more than the high-tangibility group (top 40% of its industry ﬁxed assets / total assets), comparing means

before (2002-2004) and after (2005-2008) the credit expansion cycle. This variation is economic meaningful: a 17% increase

in investment for the low-tangibility group relative to the high-tangibility group, considering the pre-event mean (17.7%).

Although some evidence is shown that the credit boom facilitated investment for ﬁrms with a low fraction of pledgeable

assets, our results are stronger (statistically and economically) for ﬁrm ﬁnancing. The average ﬁrm in the low-tangibility

group increased total debt / total assets around 6.6 p.p. more (27% of increase considering the pre-event average) than

the average ﬁrm belonging to the high-tangibility group, and this diﬀerence is also statistically signiﬁcant (5%). This

result suggests that collateral played a major role on ﬁrms access to debt before the credit expansion, and that the higher

supply of credit that followed the New Bankruptcy Law allowed less tangible ﬁrms to increase access credit markets.

Besides the increase in total debt, an important ﬁnding of our empirical estimations is that the composition of debt

changed signiﬁcantly more to the low-tangibility group. The average low-tangibility ﬁrm increased the share of long

term debt on total debt after 2005 around 11.6 p.p. (33%) more relative to an average high-tangibility ﬁrm. More than

statistically signiﬁcant (1%), this result is economic sizable: an 1/3 increase in the fraction of long term debt on total

debt to low-tangibility ﬁrms relative to high-tangibility ﬁrms after 2005 indicates a qualitatively meaningful improvement

on the access of corporate credit in Brazil, especially for ﬁrms that were potentially out of the market before the credit

expansion cycle.

Taken together, our results suggest that the credit boom of the second half of the 2000s alleviated ﬁnancial constraints

in Brazil, especially for smaller, less tangible publicly traded ﬁrms, ending up to increase long term ﬁnancing and boosting

corporate investment.

Although we ﬁnd consistent evidence for the multiplier eﬀect lead by the collateral channel and exposed in Almeida

& Campello (2007) , our results suggest a primary role of banks alleviating collateral requirements, potentially because of

18

the higher supply of credit and better growth opportunities in the economy. In this sense, our evidence supports the idea

that the relaxing collateral requirements dominated the multiplier eﬀect during the 2000s credit expansion in Brazil.
