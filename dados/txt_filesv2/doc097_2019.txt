Abstract:  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  build  a  post-Keynesian  growth  model  in  a  stock-flow 
consistent approach to a closed economy with government activity that incorporates the fiscal and 
monetary arrangement that exists in some countries around the world. More precisely, the model 
makes use of the inflation targeting regime and assumes the prohibition of treasury financing by 
Central  Bank.  The  calibrated  model  was  able  to  present  the  following  results:  (a)  after 
parameterization,  the  model  can  show  both  wage-led  and  profit-led  regimes;  (b)  There  is  the 
possibility of the crowding-out effect on shocks to increase the autonomous component of public 
spending; (c) It is possible to endogenously generate the term structure of the interest rate and this 
may have a positive or negative slope in the course of the shocks.

1.  Introduction  

 

Two major theoretical postulates of Keynesian economics are that the level of interest 
rate  is  a  strict  monetary  phenomenon,  being  determined  by  the  interaction  between  liquidity 
preference  of  households, firms  and  commercial  banks  and  the  monetary  policy  conducted by 
Central Bank (Carvalho, 2015, pp.21-25); and that an increase in government (or other element 
of  the  so-called  autonomous)  expenditures  will  always  increase  the  level  of  output  and 
employment  and  hence  aggregate  savings,  avoiding  a  crowding  out  of  private  investment  by 
government expenditures due to a “lack of savings” (Amadeo, 1989, pp.113-117), at least if the 
economy is operating in a situation of underemployment equilibrium1. The first postulate is the 
Liquidity Preference Theory, the second is the Principle of Effective Demand.  

These postulates are generally presented in a very simplified model about the workings 
of the economic system, where there is just one interest rate and the stock-flow implications of 
financing of government deficits are ignored. Many years ago, the dependence of these postulates 
on simplified assumptions regarding the structure of economic system were questioned by Tom 
Asimakopoulos,  an  unsuspected  Keynesian  economist.  In  his  1991  book,  Asimakopoulos  said 
that “Keynes´s theory of interest is dependent on the long-term expectations that determine the 
position  and  shape  of  liquidity  preference function.  He  did  not recognize  that  these  long-term 
expectations  could  be  affected  by  comparison  of  projected  rates  on  investment  and  projected 
savings (based on economy´s propensity to save) in future periods. If it appears that investment 
would  be  greater  than  normal  savings,  concerns  over  future  interest  rates  could  bring  about 
immediate  increases  in  long-term  rates  that  act  as  a  damper  to  investment  plans.  Thus,  the 
independence of investment from saving – a key element in Keynes´s theory – does not hold in 
all circumstances” (Asimakopoulos, 1991, p.116).  

The development of the so-called stock-flow consistent models by Godley (1999), Lavoie 
and Godley (2001), Zezza and Dos Santos (2006), Godley and Lavoie (2007a, 2007b) and Dos 
Santos and Zezza (2008) allowed the construction of a series of macroeconomic models that could 
track the stock-flow implications of financing of government deficit over the whole term structure 
of interest rates. One of such models is the one presented in chapter five of Godley and Lavoie 
(2007b). These  authors  considered  a  closed  economy  with four  economic  sectors: households, 
firms, government and central bank. Households´ wealth is stored in three types of assets, that are 
imperfect substitutes one to the other: money, bills and bonds. Bills are the short-term debt issued 
by the central bank in order to regulate the balance sheet liquidity of the private sector. Since bills 
are short-term debt, they are not exposed to the risk of capital losses. Bonds are the long-term 
debt  issued  by  the  government  in  order  to  finance  its  fiscal  deficit.  Long-term  bonds  are 
constituted by perpetuities, whose market price is an inverse function of the long-term interest 
rate (Godley and Lavoie, 2007b, p.132). These means that capital gains or losses must be taken 
explicit in consideration in the Transaction Flow Matrix of the model (Ibid, p. 138).  Long term 
bonds are sold in capital markets, but central bank act as a buyer of last resort, buying all bonds 
that  are  not  bought  by  households  (Ibid,  p.  166).  This  means  that  monetary  financing  of 
government deficits is allowed by the Institutional Arrangement of fiscal and monetary policy.  

Their model presented some counter-intuitive results. For example, the yield curve will 
assume  a  negative  slope  as  a  result  of  once  and  for  all  increase  in  the  short-term  interest  rate 
(p.156).  Also,  in  the  LP3  closure  of  the  model,  where  government  expenditures  are  made 
endogenous by means of the introduction of a reaction function for government expenditures that 
is dependent on the ratio of public sector borrowing requirement to GDP (p.161); a sharp decrease 
in the propensity to consume out of disposable income will produce a permanent reduction on the 
level of GDP. This result occurs to the fact that a reduction in private consumption expenditure 
triggers also a reduction of government expenditures, due to effect of the fall in economic activity 
over the tax receipts and hence over the ratio of public sector borrowing requirement to GDP, 
generating a strange “crowding-in” effect. Besides this monetary policy is completely exogenous,

since short-term interest rate is set at a level that is not related to any of the traditional goals of 
monetary policy, like to achieve some target inflation or to eliminate the output gap.  

The great shortcoming of the Godley and Lavoie (2007b) model, however, is the lack of 
correspondence between Institutional Arrangement of fiscal and monetary policy assumed by the 
model and the one that prevails in the real world. In many developed and developing economies 
monetary policy is operated under the framework of Inflation Targeting Regimes, which reduces 
enormously the scope for monetary authorities to set “freely” the level of short-term interest rates. 
Moreover, in many countries money financing of government deficits is explicitly forbidden by 
law.  This  is,  for  instance,  the  case  of  Brazil,  where  loans  of  central  bank  to  the  treasury  are 
explicitly forbidden by the article 164 of the Federal Constitution 2. Moreover, perpetuities are 
not the main type of bonds issued by government in order to finance its fiscal deficit. Taking again 
Brazil  as  an  example,  more  or  less  40%  of  government  debt  is  constituted  by  the  so-called 
Financial Treasury Bills (Letras Financeiras do Tesouro) which is an interest rate-indexed bond 
that had a special feature of having zero duration in Mackaulay sense3, which means that the price 
of  these  bonds  has  no sensitivity  to  changes  in interest  rates4,  being  free  of  the  risk  of  capital 
losses, whatever their maturity (Holanda Barbosa, 2006).  

The aim of the present article is precisely to build an SFC growth model that incorporates 
the Institutional Arrangement of fiscal and monetary policy that exists in the real world. More 
precisely  in  our  model  monetary  policy  will  be  conducted  under  the  framework  of  Inflation 
Targeting  Regime,  money  financing  of  government  deficit  will  be  -forbidden  by  law  and 
government issued interest rate-indexed bonds in order to finance its fiscal deficit. We are not 
saying that these institutional arrangements should be considered the ideal one for the conduction 
of fiscal and monetary policy; but we only want to analyze its effect over the dynamics of our 
model economy since these arrangements are the ones that prevails in many countries in the real 
world5.  

In  the  model  to  be  presented  in  this  article  we  will  consider  a  closed  economy  with 
government activities. Firms produces a homogeneous output, which served both for consumption 
and  investment;  and  operate  in  a  market  structure  characterized  by  monopolistic  competition.  
Prices are set by means of a variable mark-up rate over unit labor costs. Labor is the only variable 
input used in production, but production also requires the utilization of physical capital. Regarding 
pricing decisions, we will consider that the weighted average cost of capital as one of the main 
determinants of mark-up rate. This assumption expresses the idea that our model economy works 
in in accordance to the logic of the actual stage of the capitalist evolution, which is the finance-
dominated capitalism (Hein, 2012). On this stage of capitalist evolution the financial variables 
had  a  growing  influence  over  the  production,  pricing  and  investment  decisions  of  productive 
firms6.  

Government takes no production activities and buys goods from firms in order to carry 
on  its  (unproductive)  activities.  Government  consumption is financed  by  income  taxes  and  by 
selling interest rate-indexed bonds to the rentiers. All investment is made by private firms and is 
financed by retained profits and loans from commercial banks. Workers are organized in labor 
unions in order to strength their position in the wage bargains. Labor unions define targets for the 
wage share in income, based on which they set the rate of wage inflation.  

Central  Bank  operates  monetary  policy  in  an  Inflation  Targeting  Regime,  setting  the 
short-term interest rate in order to achieve a numerical target for inflation rate in the long-term. 
Central bank is forbidden by law to buy government bills, so there is no fiscal dominance and

3 About duration in Mackaulay sense see Fabozzi (1999) 
4 One important implication of this kind of bond for the construction of SFC models is that there are no capital 
gains or losses on long-term bonds to be included in the Transaction Flow Matrix of the Model.

government had to finance 100% of fiscal deficit by selling interest rate-indexed bonds on capital 
markets. This means that long term interest rate is thus determined by capital markets, being the 
price that coordinates the portfolio decisions of households from one hand, and the composition 
of financial wealth from the other side. Government bills are assumed to be free of interest risk 
since coupon payments are indexed by the long-term rate. Households are composed by workers 
and rentiers. Workers are supposed to “spend all they get” in consumption goods; and rentiers 
save all their current income – originated from distributed profits and interest on bonds - and store 
it in financial assets. All financial wealth belongs to rentiers.  

Once the accounting structure and the behavior equations of the model are presented and 
explained, then we will use an algorithm developed by Costa Santos (2017)7 in order to find the 
parameters for the model that generate steady-state values for the endogenous variables. In the 
baseline model dynamics, the economy will converge to a steady-state position where (i) long-
term  interest  rate  is  higher  than  short  term  interest  rate,  defining  a  yield  curve  with  positive 
inclination; (ii) both demand and accumulation regimes are wage-led; (iii) inflation rate converges 
to the target; and (iv) government to GDP ratio stabilized at a considerably low level.  

Hence the model is used to analyze the effects of a once-and-for all change in the level of 
government expenditures over the time path of investment to GDP ratio, profit share, capacity 
utilization, the spread between long-term and short-term interest rates and inflation. The results 
of  the  simulation  show  that  a  permanent  increase  in  the  level  of  government  expenditures  is 
followed by a permanent decrease in the investment to GDP ratio, a permanent increase in the 
spread between long and short-term interest rate, a permanent decrease in the level of capacity 
utilization and a permanent increase in the profit share, but with no lasting effects over inflation 
dynamics.  

These results show that in an SFC growth model with inflation targeting and zero money 
financing of fiscal deficit, a permanent increase in the level of government expenditures produces 
a  crowding-out  effect  over  investment  expenditures  and  a  redistribution  of  income  from 
households to firms and rentiers. This is a novel and surprising result for the SFC model literature.  

2.  Accounting Structure and Assumptions of the Model 

As we had told in the introduction, the model at hand aims to understand the dynamics of 
public  financing  and  its  interrelations  with  the  other  macroeconomic  variables  in  a  closed 
economy adopting as hypothesis the non-financing of long-term public debt securities through 
the Central Bank (an unusual hypothesis in the SFC literature, but it is a good representation of 
the relation of monetary and fiscal authorities in countries like Brazil). As a starting point, we will 
describe the basic structural features of this economy. 

First, we will consider an economy with unlimited labor supply during simulated periods, 
so that the availability of labor is never a constraint to the expansion of output (Lewis, 1954). The 
existence of labor unions, however, makes it possible for wages of employed workers to be set 
above the subsistence level due to the insider-outsider effect in wage bargaining (Blanchard and 
Fischer,  1989,  pp.  448-449).  In  other  words,  only  employed  workers  participate  in  the  wage 
bargaining.  There  is  also  no  technical  progress  which  guarantees  a  constant  level  of  labor 
productivity. 

The model assumes the existence of five institutional sectors: households (workers and 
rentiers), firms, banks, central bank and government. Aligned to the most common hypothesis in 
SFC models, this is a one-good economy, where output can be both invested and consumed. Table 
1 and table 2 summarize the accounting structure of this economy, representing the assets and 
liabilities of the institutional sectors and the matrix of transactions and flow of funds, respectively. 

                                                      

7 In that work, Costa Santos (2017) shows that there are similar results between studying the stability criterion 
by the traditional analytical method and the algorithm developed for model simulation.

Regarding households, we will adopt the traditional Post-Keynesian hypothesis of class 
segmentation between workers and rentiers (Harcourt, 2006, pp. 6-11). The first group receives 
wages from their labor supply and spends them paying taxes over their income and consuming 
everything  else.  In  this  way,  since  there  are  no  leftovers  (no  savings)  and  there  is  no  wealth 
inherited by this class. Their equity is zero and workers do not accumulate wealth over time. 

The second class is formed by the rentiers. This class do not supply labor services and 
their  income  comes  from  distributed  profits  from  firms  and  banks  and  interests  over  financial 
wealth. Rentiers´ financial wealth  is allocated between bank deposits and interest rate-indexed 
government bonds. These two assets generate as gross income interest on deposits and interest on 
bonds. In net terms there is the discount of a tax rate on this income. Since we are considering 
interest rate-indexed government bonds, there is no capital gains or losses to be computed as part 
of the disposable income of rentiers.  

The  firms,  in  turn,  shows  in  their  balance  sheet  the  physical  capital  responsible  for 
production of goods supplied in this economy. On the liability side, there are loans taken from 
commercial banks. 

Government had only interest rate-indexed bonds as its´ liabilities. Therefore, it is also 
assumed that government do not undertake any production activities. Government net worth is 
also negative. The Central Bank (CB), which has a link with the Government, is not allowed by 
law  to  buy  bonds,  so  there  is  a  clear  institutional  separation  between  fiscal  (Treasury)  and 
monetary  (Central  Bank)  authorities.  CB's  liability  is  made  up  of  the  reserves  of  the  Banking 
Sector,  since  there  is  no  paper  money  in  the  system;  and  the  asset  side  is  constituted  by  the 
advances provided to the banking system to guarantee its liquidity. The only relation that arises 
in this economy between the CB and the Government is that the profit obtained by the receipt of 
interest from the banks in relation to the advances is passed on to the Treasury. 

Lastly,  we  have  commercial  banks  that  have  as  assets  the  loans  granted  to  firms  and 
reserves within CB. On the liability side, loans taken via advances with CB and the deposits of 
the  rentiers.  The  commercial  bank  profit  comes  from  the  spread  between  the  interest  rate  of 
funding and the interest rate of the loans provided to the firms.

 The Model Structure and Behavior Equations 

In this section we will present the structure and the behavior equations of the economy at 

hand.  

3.1. 

Price, Inflation and Income Distribution 

Regarding the behavior equations of the model we will consider a closed economy where 
firms operate in a market structure with monopolistic competition. In this setting prices are formed 
by means of a mark-up over unit labor costs as expressed in Equation (1). We are assuming that 
labor is the only variable input used in production and its productivity (𝑞) is assumed constant 
over time; i.e. there is no technical progress. The mark-up rate (m) is not constant; but changes 
due  to  changes  in  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,    𝑎  ,  and  on  the  level  of  capacity 
utilization of production inherited from the previous period,     8, as we can see in equation (2). 
The dependence of the mark-up rate to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC, hereafter) 
is a simple way to formalize the idea that the economy at hand is financialized in the sense that 
price  decision  –  and  hence  income  distribution  -  are  directly  linked  with  financial  variables9. 
Regarding the negative influence of capacity utilization on the rate of mark-up, we are simply 
adopting the new Keynesian perspective about counter-cyclical mark-up.  

The profit share in income, ℎ, is determined in equation (3), being dependent on the rate 
of  mark-up.  On  the  other  hand,  wage  share  can  be  obtained  through  the  residual  form  by  the 
subtraction of profit in the income, as it appears in (4). 

Equation (5) shows the target value for the wage share that is demanded by labor unions, 
which  is  based  in  Rowthorn  (1977).  This  target  has  an  autonomous  component,  𝜔0,  plus  a 
component that captures the influence of the level of activity – represented by the level of capacity 
utilization, u – over income claims by unions. Equation (6), in turn, presents the wage inflation 
dynamics.  Unions  demand  nominal  wage  increases  in  order to  compensate  the erosion  of real 
wages  by  the  inflation  occurred  in  the  previous  period  plus  a  component  that  captures  the 
distributive conflict, given by the difference between the desired wage share by labor unions and 
the actual share, 𝛼   (𝜔𝑑   𝜔).

8 We assume the premise commonly adopted in New Keynesian models of using a counter-cyclical mark-
up.  Examples  in:  CALVO  (1983),  CARLIN  and  SOSKICE,  D.  (2006).  CHRISTOPHER  and  RAMEY 
(2013). 

9 A similar approach is adopted by Hein (2012, chapter 3), where the mark-up rate depends on rentiers´ 
return on equity and bonds, instead of the WACC.

Equation (7) summarizes the dynamics of inflation in the economy at hand. It is given by 
three  parts.  The  first  one  is  related  to  the  mark-up  dynamics,  given  by  (𝑚   Δ  𝑎      
𝑚2  Δ   )/(1   𝑚0   𝑚     𝑎       𝑚2     ).  The  second  part  is  the  inertial  component 
resulting from the backward looking of the unions regarding inflation expectations and the third 
part captures the distributive conflict. 

Equation  (8)  shows  the  rate  of  return  over  productive  capital  in  this  economy.  It  is 
obtained by dividing total profits by the capital stock inherited from the previous period. Another 
way to calculate is by multiplying ℎ(∙)   (∙).10 

 

3.2.  Households 
 

3.2.1.  Consumption and Households Saving 

As  previously  shown,  households  are  composed  by  workers  and  rentiers.  Workers 
consume all their disposable income and consequently do not save or accumulate wealth. Thus, 
equation (9) shows that worker’s consumption is the residue of wages,   , after the incidence of 
income tax, 𝜃. 

Rentiers, in turn, will save all their available disposable income and will only consume a 
portion  of  the  wealth  inherited  from  the  previous  period.  This  is  explicit  in  equation  (10), 
considering that the propensity to spend of the inherited wealth is given by the interval 0 <   ≪
1. 

By aggregating the consumption of the two classes, we have the aggregate consumption 
function  that  is  presented  in  equation  (11).  This  means  that  consumption  is  explained  by  the 
current level of disposable income and the inherited wealth of the previous period. 
   = (1   𝜃)     
 
   =         
 
  =         = (1   𝜃)                 

 
 
(11)

(10) 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

Where    is the workers consumption,    is the rentiers consumption, 𝜃 is a tax rate of 
income,   is the wealth propensity for consumption,   is the aggregate consumption,  ℎ   is a 
inherited rentiers wealth. 

Nevertheless, we can use (11) in order to normalize consumption by the capital stock. 

Defining  𝜔 =   /𝑌 and   = 𝑌/   , we get:  
𝑐 = (1   𝜃)  𝜔           

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(11b) 

Where c is the normalized consumption by the stock of inherited capital,  /   ; 𝜔 is the 
share of wages in income and  𝑟   is the inherited capital divided by the stock of inherited capital. 

3.2.2.  The Dynamics of Households Wealth 

The wealth of households is the sum of the wealth of the rentiers and the wealth of the 
workers.  Since  workers  do  not  have  wealth,  then  we  have  that   ℎ =   ,  that  is,  the  wealth  of 
households is the wealth of the rentiers. Then, we have that originally, the dynamics of wealth is 
given by: 

   =            
However, as part of the inherited wealth is consumed and all the current income of the 

(12) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rentiers after taxation is saved, we get: 

   = (1    )         (1   𝜃)(                  𝑑)

Where    is the wealth of the rentiers,    is the interest rate of the public bills,    are the 

dividends received from the banks,  𝑑 are the dividends received from the firms. 

3.2.3.  Portfolio of Rentiers11 

The  rentiers  allocate  their  wealth  between  only  two  financial  assets:  Deposits  and 
Government  Bonds.  Rentiers  endogenously  modify  their  portfolio  allocation  according  to 
changes in the spread between bond (long-term) interest and the advances (short-term) interest 
rate; and also due to changes in the level of economic activity, represented by disposable income. 
This is displayed in equations (13) and (14) below: 

 𝑑 = [𝜆0   𝜆   (      𝑎)]         λ2  (1   𝜃)  𝑌  

 

 𝑑 = [(1   𝜆0)   λ   (      𝑎)]         λ2  (1   𝜃)  𝑌   

 

 

(13) 

(14) 

 

Where  𝑑 is the demand for bonds in current period, 𝜆0 is the autonomous component of 
the portfolio to allocate in bonds, 𝜆  is the sensitivity parameter of the bonds demand to the spread 
between long term and short term interest rates,    is the bond interest rate,  𝑎 is the advances 
interest rate,  𝑑 is the bank deposits demanded by rentiers. 

Following  Tobin's  logic  for  portfolio  construction12,  we  have  some  restrictions  on 
parameter values. The first is that all wealth must be allocated between bank deposits and bonds. 
The  second  constrain  is  that  if  there  is  a  percentage  increase  in  one  asset,  the  other  must  be 
decreased by the same percentage. 

3.3.  Government and Central Bank 

The  Government  is  presented  by  equations  (15)  to  (21).  Equation  (15)  shows  the 
government's tax revenue, which is obtained endogenously as a rate, θ, over the level of economic 
activity. Note that this focuses on wages, profits in its broad conception that encompasses the real 
activity and financial activity of that economy. In order for there to be no double taxation, we 
define that dividend taxation occurs in the payment of the households. 

Equation (16)  shows  that fiscal  policy  is designed  for  the  government  consumption to 
grow  at  the  same  rate  of  capital  stock.  Equation  (17)  shows  the  public  sector  borrowing 
requirement before the payment of interest on the debt13. Equation (18) shows the dynamics of 
public debt. The stock of bonds in the current period is given by the inherited bonds from previous 
period  plus  the  payment  of  interest  of  inherited  bonds  plus  the  public  sector  borrowing 
requirement (PBR). Finally, in equation (19), we have that the profit of the Central Bank is given 
by the receipt of interest on the rediscount operations used by Commercial Banks.

11 This approach is Based on Tobin (1980, 1982).  
12 It is usual in the SFC literature to make use of the portfolio decision equations referring to the way that 
James Tobin did as well. Further details can be found in Chapter 3 of Godley, W. and Lavoie, M. (2007b).

the central bank. 

3.4. 

The Term Structure of the Interest Rate 

The developed model makes use of two distinct interest rates. The first is equivalent to a 
short-term rate. It is used by the Central Bank as the one that pays the advance loans. It is fixed 
by the means of a Taylor rule14 with the aim of being an instrument for the achievement of some 
numerical target for the inflation rate ( ̂ 𝑇) in the long term. This means that monetary policy in 
the economy at hand is conducted under the Institutional Arrangement of the Inflation Targeting 
Regime15. This is presented in equation (20) and its behavior is explained by an inertial component 
(due  to the  so-called  interest  rate  smoothing)  and  a  component  that  captures  the  deviations  of 
inflation from the inflation target. 

The second, presented in equation (21), is the long-term interest rate16, that is, the interest 
rate  on  public  debt  securities,  which  is  determined  by  the  interaction  between  the  supply  of 
government  securities,  determined  by  the  composition  of  financial  wealth  and  public  sector 
borrowing requirement, and the demand for then, given by the portfolio behavior of rentiers.

3.5. 

Comercial Banks 

The activity of the banking sector is described through equations (22) to (26). We suppose 
that interest rate on the bank loans is determined by applying a mark-up on the advances rate, 
according to equation (22). 

Equation (23) indicates that a share of the bank deposits is maintained in the form of bank 
reserves in the central bank. Equation (24), in turn, shows that bank profits are calculated as the 
difference between the income received from interest on loans and the interest paid on advances. 
Its taxation occurs in the payment to the shareholders, since all banking profits are distributed to 
the households. 

Equation (25) shows that loans in the current period are given by the sum of the loans 
inherited from previous period plus the difference between the desired investment by firms and 
the profits retained to finance it. 

Equation (26) presents central bank loans to commercial banks. The loans demanded by 
the firms are fully supplied by the banks, so credit supply is fully endogenous. The liquidity for 
banks is provided by the rediscount operations conducted by central bank. In this way, we have 
the guarantee that there is unrestricted credit in the system.

presented in the appendix.

Where  𝑙 is the interest rate of loans, 𝜙  is the mark-up of bank loans, 𝜏 is the share of 
deposits held as reserve within central bank,   are the reserves,   deposits,    is the profit from 
banking activity,   are the loans. 

3.6. 

Firms 

The equations that define the behavior of firms are given by (27) to (32). The weighted 
average capital cost or WACC is given by equation (27). It represents a weighted average of the 
cost of equity and the cost of third-party capital (loans). 

Equation  (28),  in  turn,  presents  the  investment  rate.  It  is  given  by  an  autonomous 
component,  𝛾0  and  a  component,  𝛾 ,  which  captures  the  difference  between  the  return  on 
economic activity and the average cost weighted by capital. This specification of the investment 
function is based on Robinson (1956).  

Equation  (29)  presents  the  calculation  of  profit  before  taxes.  In  order  to  avoid  double 
taxation,  the  model  assumes  that  dividends  are  taxed  only  after  they  are  distributed,  that  is, 
households are responsible for their payment and firms pay for the share that is retained. Profit is 
calculated directly through the profit share times the national income minus the interest payment 
over loans. 

Equation (30) shows that dividends are a percentage share, d, of total profit after payment 
of interest on loans. The equation (31) complements the idea showing that the retained profits are 
equal to total profits times the retention coefficient (1-d) times one minus the tax rate. Finally, 
(32) reveals the dynamics of capital that is given by accumulated capital  until previous period 
plus  gross  investment.  For  simplicity,  we  consider  that  there  is  no  depreciation  of  productive 
capital.

In this section we will present the reduced version of the model. Although it is not usual 
in the SFC literature to use this type of approach, we chose to simplify the model by replacing 
and manipulating algebraically until it was possible to take the complete system of 32 equations 
and transform it into one of only 9 difference equations. 

To that end, the variables that grow at the level, such as 𝑌,  ,  ,  ,   , among others, were 
normalized by dividing by the stock of capital, which also grows in level. The advantage in doing 
this is that in the end we have a system that can converge to a steady state rather than just providing 
a balanced growth path. 

In  addition,  we  can  through  the  reduced  system,  perform  the  calculation  of the partial 
derivatives and infer the short-term links and whether these assume positive or negative values  
(when is possible to define without numerical calculus). 

Thus, we present the first equation that represents inflation. It has three terms that need 
inflation,  described  by 
to  be 
called  mark-up 
(𝑚   𝑧 Δ   𝑎     𝑚2  Δ   ) (1   𝑚0   𝑚   𝑧 Δ   𝑎     𝑚2     )
. This term represents the price 
mark-up change of firms over time and in the steady state it converges to zero. The second term 

analyzed.  The 

first  one 

is

is the inertial component of inflation, given by (1   𝛼 )   ̂   and the third captures the conflict

(33) 

Next, we have the   curve (or IS curve) of the economy created in equation (34). In it we 
have the term which is the well-known Keynesian multiplier, given by 1 (𝜃   𝛾2    3  ℎ)
, where 
 3 = [(1   𝜃)   𝛾 ]. As can be noted, the multiplier rises as wage share increases (and profit-
share decreases). The autonomous components in period 𝑡 are             , where    = 𝛾0   𝑔0. 
As  the  curve  also  shows,  the  higher  the  interest  rate,  the  lower  will  be  the  level  of  capacity 
utilization.

Equations  (35)  and  (36)  have  been  presented  previously.  The  first  is  the  equation  that 
provides the Taylor rule that defines the dynamics of the short-term interest rate while the second 
defines the interest rate of the public bonds necessary to clear capital markets.

Equations (37) and (38) present the dynamics of profit-share and investment. The profit-
share has already been exposed in the complete model, while the investment equation has been 
simplified  here  to  make  the  channels  clear.  It  has  an  autonomous  parameter  representing  the 
"animal spirits", a parameter of sensitivity to changes in capacity utilization and profit-share and 
another parameter of sensitivity to the interest rate.

Short-run link among the variables 

 
As mentioned earlier, from the reduced system, we have an easier work to establish the 
short-term connections between the current and lagged variables of the system. We have 55 partial 
derivatives of 116 possible combinations between variables. We will comment on some of them 
in the sequence and these are presented in table 3 below. 

First,  let's  talk  about  inflation.  This  variable  increases  with  the  increase  in  the  use  of 
current capacity utilization, falls with the increase of the short-term interest rate, rises with the 
increase  of  inertial  inflation  (lagged)  and  may  have  a  positive  or  negative  relation  with  the 
inherited capacity utilization and the rate of lagged short-term interest, depending on the values 
of the parameters used. 

Table 3 – Short-run link among the variables of SFC Model 

 

11 

 

Following, we have the   curve that undergoes negative variations when: the short-term 
interest rate rises, the profit-share rises, the inflationary inertia rises and the inherited interest rate 
rises. It undergoes positive variations when the normalized inherited wealth rises. 

With respect to the short-term interest rate, this rises when: inertial inflation increases or 
when the lagged short-term interest rate increases. The interest rate on government bonds rises 
when: it increases the capacity utilization, increases the short-term interest rate, increases inertial 
inflation,  increases  the  lagged  short-term  interest  rate,  increases  the  interest  rate  of  inherited 
bonds, increases the inherited stock of bonds normalized by the capital stock. The rate undergoes 
negative  variations  when:  it  increases  the  stock  of  inherited  loans  normalized  by  the  stock  of 
capital and when inherited wealth increases normalized by the stock of capital. 

Following  this,  we  analyze  the  profit  share that  increases  with positive  changes  in  the 
lagged WACC and falls with the increase in the lagged capacity utilization. The investment rate 
increases  due  to  increased  capacity  utilization,  increased  profit  share  and  increased  inherited 
wealth. It is negatively related to the interest rate and to inflationary inertia. 

The last three variables are the normalized stocks of bonds, loans, and rentier wealth. The 
first  one  has  positive  variations  when there  is: increase  of the interest rate  of inherited bonds, 
increase of the stock of normalized bonds inherited. There are negative variations when: there is 
an  increase  in  the  investment  rate,  there  is  an  increase  in  the  normalized  stock  of  current  and 
lagged loans. The relationship can be positive or negative depending on the parameters for the 
following variables: capacity utilization, current and inherited short-term interest rates. 

The second stock, the normalized loans, shows increases when we have an increase in 
lagged  normalized  loans. The  partial  derivative  signs  can  be  positive  or  negative  for:  capacity 
utilization, profit-share, investment rate, inherited inflation, and inherited interest rate. 

Finally, the third stock, presented in (41) by the equation that gives the normalized wealth 
dynamics of the rentiers, indicates the following relations: positive increases when the interest 
rate increases inherited from government bills, bank loans and rentier wealth both lagged. 

 

Long-run stability and growth regimes 

4.2. 
 
4.2.1.  The Steady State 

In this section we will define the fixed points that must be found in the steady state of the 
model. It will not be possible to isolate the variables only in function of the parameters. However, 
even  if  this  is  not  possible,  it  is  important  to  separate  the  points  to  investigate  possible 
indeterminations or overdeterminations of the system. Thus, we have the following steady state 
values:

(a)  Inflation:  

As the monetary authority will raise short term interest rate up to the level that is 
required for inflation does not deviate from the target17, in the steady state we will have: 

 ̂ ∗ =  𝑇 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(42) 

(b)  Capacity Utilization: 

Since capacity utilization is the adjustment variable of distributive conflict, in the steady 
state that level had to be compatible with the value that can bring inflation to the target. Therefore, 
we have from (33) that: 

 ∗ =

 
𝜔2

( ̂ 𝑇   𝜔∗   𝜔 ) 

(c)  Interest Rate on Advances: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(43) 

As equation (33) determines the level of  ∗, the equation (34) allows us to determine the 

level of the short-term interest rate in the steady state. In this way, we have: 

∗ =
 𝑎

 
𝐴2

  [(          

∗)  

 

𝜓1 𝜔2

  ( ̂ 𝑇   𝜔∗   𝜔 )]

Where    = 𝛾0   𝑔0; 𝜓  = 1/{1   (1   𝜃)   𝛾2   [(1   𝜃)   𝛾 ]  ℎ∗};  2 = 𝛾   𝑧 . 

(d)  Interest Rate on Government Bonds: 

Using  the  same  previous  criteria,  from  equation  (36),  we  have  the  following  equation 
(45). As can be noted, the interest rate value depends on the parameter values to be positive and 
higher than the short-term interest rate. For this reason, during our simulations, we need to restrict 
the parameter values so that the model result makes economic sense.

(e)  Profit-share: 

Regarding  the  profit-share,  the  direct  result  of  the  steady  state  is  expressed  by  the 
following equation (46). The result dispenses other comments. Mathematically it is clear that we 
must have 𝑚0   𝑚   𝑧    𝑎

The  level  of  indebtedness  in  the  steady  state  depends  positively  on  the  autonomous

4.2.2.  Growth Regimes (Wage or Profit Led?)18 

In  this  work  we  used  an  algorithm  developed  by  Costa  Santos  (2017)  to  find  the 
parameters  for  the  model  that  generate  steady  state.  Briefly,  the algorithm  is  developed in  the 
following steps: 

 

1.  Generation of random parameters through a plausible economic interval. 
2.  Model resolution via Gauss-Seidel using these random parameters as input. 
3.  Storage of reduced model variables when 𝑡 = 1000. 
4.  Separate Δ ̂, Δ , Δℎ, Δ 𝑛, Δ 𝑎, Δ  , Δ , Δ , Δ   < 10 6 (tolerance). 
5.  From the filtered data, it is calculated for 𝑡 = 1000 the values of Δ /Δℎ and Δ 𝑛/Δℎ. 
6.  If Δ /Δℎ > 0 and Δ 𝑛/Δℎ > 0, Profit-led demand and accumulation regimes. Wage-

led, otherwise.  

Having explained the steps of the above algorithm, we present figure 1, in the sequence, 
with the results obtained for 109 simulations, which finally could be separated the wage led and 
profit led regimes and estimated in a non-parametric way the density probability via Kernel. 

The use of this type of methodology allows us to separate parameters to later carry out 
simulations with this calibration and to investigate the general properties of the model for each of 
the two possibilities of growth regime.

Calibration, Simulation and Results19 

Baseline Scenario and Steady State 

The  complete  model  was  simulated  based  on  the  parameters  and  exogenous  variables 
described in table 4 below. The first result to be reported is the baseline scenario which describes 
the convergence of the model to steady state.  

Table 4 – Parameters Used in Baseline Simulation 

 

Figure 2 below shows in the first quadrant the left the paths of the components shares of 
GDP from the perspective of demand. As it is a closed economy, we have  /𝑌    /𝑌    /𝑌 =
1.  In  this  way,  we  have  that   /𝑌  converges  to  values  close  to  60%  while  the  other  variables 
converge to 20% each. 

In the second upper quadrant to the right, we have the path of public and private debt in 
this  economy,  these  both  variables  over  the  GDP.  In  the  baseline  scenario,  we  then  have  the 
convergence of public debt to values around 20% of GDP and private debt to approximately 40% 
of GDP. 

In the third quadrant, which is in the second row of the first column, we have the profit 
share  and  the  wage  share  of  this  economy  converging  to  the  steady  state.  The  wage  share 
converges to a value around 70% while the profit share to close to 30%, obviously both having to 
add up to 100%. 

In the fourth quadrant, which is in the second row and second column of figure 2, we 
have the dynamics of inflation in this economy. We have that for the values used in the simulation, 
the  monetary  policy  is  efficient  in  being  able  to  take  the  path  of  the  inflation  towards  the 
established goal. Thus, in the steady state,  ̂ =  𝑇. 

In the fifth quadrant of the same figure, third row and first column, we have the dynamics 
of short-term and long-term interest rates. In this baseline scenario we can see that the short is 
lower  than  the  long,  which  at  first  can  be  affected  depending  on  the  shocks  that  reach  that 
economy. 

In the sixth quadrant, we have the portfolio behavior of the rentiers. There we find that in 
the steady state the wealth is subdivided between 20% in bonds and 80% in deposits. The last two 
quadrants present the dynamics of the investment rate, which converges to values between 6 and

between 70% and 80%, so that the observed trajectories of this simulated economy are similar to 
the capitalist experience observed so far.

Still on the model in base scenario, we present figure 2 that brings the results of the growth 
regime of the model. There are four quadrants with the following paths: Wage Share × Capacity 
Utilization; Wage Share × Investment Rate; Profit Share × Capacity Utilization; Profit Share × 
Investment Rate. The convergence to the steady state between the variables makes it clear that 
the growth regime is wage-led, since there is a positive relation between the investment rate and 
the capacity utilization with the wage share.

Shocks – Increase of Desired ratio of Government Consumption to Capital 
Stock  

 

 

After  analyzing  the  time  path  of  the  model  for  the  base  scenario,  we  will  present  the 
results after an exogenous shock was applied to a parameter of the model.  More precisely, we 
applied a shock of 14% increase in the desired ratio of government consumption to capital stock, 
𝑔0, representing an increase in the level of government expenditure at a point in time.  

The results of the shock are presented in figure 4 and 5. In figure 4, we have an important 
result of the model. The increase in the level of government expenditures produces a crowding-
out  effect  over  private  investment,  in  a  sense  that  the  increase  in  the  ratio  of  government 
consumption over GDP resulted in a one to one reduction in the ratio of investment to GDP. Since 
the ratio of investment to GDP is one of the main determinants of the growth rate of capital stock, 
then an increase in the level of government expenditures will produce a reduction of the pace of 
capital  accumulation in the  long  term.  We  will  explain  the  mechanism  behind  these  effects  in 
sequence. 

The  crowding-out  mechanism  of  the  model  basically  occurs  through  the  following 
channels:  by  raising  an  exogenous  component  of  demand;  there  will  occur  immediately  an 
increase in the level of capacity utilization. This effect increases the level of conflict over income 
distribution since target wage share increases, which in turn accelerates inflation. In the next turn, 
the monetary authority perceiving the deviation of inflation to the target; starts to raise the short-
term interest rate to decrease aggregate demand and capacity utilization. In doing so, there will 
be an increase in the equilibrium level of short-term interest rate that will also raise the long-term 
interest rate and the cost of capital; affecting investment decisions in a negative way.  

This  crowding-out  effect  is  unusual  in  SFC  models,  due  to  the  demand-led  nature  of 
output and employment decisions in those type of models. However, as we introduce real world 
institutional arrangements of monetary and fiscal policy in the model, then new and surprising 
results can appear.  

Any  increasing  in  public  spending  needs  to  be  financed  by  an  increase  in  taxation  or 
issuance of new bonds, when money financing of government deficits is forbidden by law. As 
expected, the initial effect over capacity utilization of an increase in government expenditure is 

 

3 

expansionary, according to the fourth quadrant of figure 5. This increase in capacity utilization is 
not enough, however, to increase tax receipts to such a level capable to balance the public budget; 
in order words; there are no such a thing as a perpetuum mobile device that allowed increase in 
government expenditures to be self-financed. Thus, the initial shock unbalances the government's 
primary budget, according to quadrant 3 of Figure 4. Throughout the transitional dynamics, the 
budget converges to approximately -1% of deficit and to a stable debt-to-GDP ratio. 

Regarding the effects of increasing government expenditures over income distribution, 
we can see that the effect on profit-share is initially to decrease and then to converge to a higher 
level. As the level of capacity utilization falls slightly, the net effect on the actual return on assets 
is virtually neutral. The same cannot be said about the cost of capital. As the CB raises the interest 
rate  to  overthrow  economic  activity  and  reduce  inflation  to  the  target  level,  there  will  be  an 
increase in the WACC and a net fall in the spread of profit rate over WACC, according to the 
sixth  quadrant  of  figure  4,  which  also  contributes  to  the  reduction  of  the  pace  of  capital 
accumulation.  

Finally, we also have a new set of values for the balanced growth path. As we can see 
easily  in  figure  5,  steady-state  growth  rates  of  investment,  consumption  and  government 
expenditures are lower after the shock over fiscal policy.

6.  Final Remarks.  

 

Throughout this article we developed a SFC growth model that  aims to understand the 
dynamics of public financing and its interrelations with the other macroeconomic variables in a 
closed economy with government activities,  in which moneatary policy is conducted under an 
Inflation  Targeting  Regime,  there  is  no  money  financing  of  government  debt  and  government 
issues an interest rate-indexed bond in order to finance its fiscal deficit.  As general features of 
the  model,  we  have  (i)  a  Taylor  rule  to  define  the  short-term  interest  rate;  (ii)  a  long-rate 
determined  by  the  balance  between  the  composition  of  financial  wealth  between  government 
bonds, bills and money, in one hand, and the portfolio decisions of households, on the other hand; 
and (iii) the dynamics of inflation being given by a inertial component and distributive conflict. 

The  complete  model  is  characterized  as  a  system  of  thirty-two  differential  equations, 

twenty-one parameters, two exogenous variables, and four initial stocks. 

The results of the parameter mapping algorithm show that through the specification of 
the  investment  function  of  the  model  it  is  possible  to  obtain  both  led  and  profit  led  schemes 
according to Blecker (2002). When broadly mapped20, the most likely regime is wage led, with 
about 70% of the stable cases found. 

Thus, in the presentation of the model, some simulations were carried out for a specific 
set of parameters that generated a wage led regime. The results of the simulation show that in an 
SFC growth model with inflation targeting and zero money financing of fiscal deficit, a permanent 
increase in the level of government expenditures produces a crowding-out effect over investment 
expenditures and a redistribution of income from households to firms and rentiers. This is a novel 
and surprising result for the SFC model literature. Future research will investigate if these results 
could  be  also  obtained  in  models  with  alternative  Institutional  Arrangements  for  fiscal  and 
monetary policy.
