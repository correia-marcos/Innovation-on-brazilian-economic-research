Abstract: In recent years, the debate on issues related to demographic changes and their impacts on
the economy has increased. However, demographic changes affect not only variables such as
economic growth and the labor market, but also aggregate consumption, and especially the
composition of this consumption. These changes in population composition may occur in the
coming decades in many parts of the globe, and their effects on the composition of consumption,
notably on energy demand and emissions are not yet known. In this context, this article aims to
estimate the changes in the pattern of consumption in Brazil due to the changes projected in the age
pyramid in 2050 and the consequences of these changes on CO2 emissions. For this, projections will
be made using a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model (CGE) considering 65
sectors and 7 age groups for the Brazilian economy. The results suggest that the change in age
structure seem to lead to an emissions less intensive consumption pattern, around 0.25%
(accumulated deviation relative to baseline) in 2050.

Resumo: Nos últimos anos, aumentou o debate sobre questões relacionadas às mudanças
demográficas e seus impactos na economia. No entanto, as mudanças demográficas afetam não
apenas variáveis como o crescimento econômico e o mercado de trabalho, mas também o consumo
agregado e, principalmente, a composição desse consumo. Essas mudanças na composição
populacional podem ocorrer nas próximas décadas em muitas partes do globo, e seus efeitos sobre a
composição do consumo, notadamente sobre a demanda de energia e as emissões ainda não são
conhecidos. Nesse contexto, este artigo tem como objetivo estimar as mudanças no padrão de
consumo no Brasil em função das mudanças projetadas na pirâmide etária em 2050 e as
consequências dessas mudanças nas emissões de CO2. Para isso, serão feitas projeções usando um
modelo de equilíbrio geral computável dinâmico (CGE) considerando 65 setores e 7 grupos etários
para a economia brasileira. Os resultados sugerem que a mudança na estrutura etária parece levar a
um padrão de consumo menos intensivo de emissões, em torno de 0,25% (desvio acumulado em
relação à linha de base) em 2050.

   1. Introduction

          In the last few decades, researchers around the world have shown growing concern in
studying issues related to demographic changes and their impacts on the economy. According to
Park and Hewings (2007), the focus is on the impact of population size on economic growth, whose
debate was centered on whether economic growth is limited, promoted or independent of population
growth. Among the pessimistic current, like Ehrlich (1968), it is believed that rapid economic
growth is a threat to limited resources since much of the investment needs to be used to serve the
growing population. On the other hand, the more optimistic (Kuznets, 1967; Simon, 1981) believe
that a larger population facilitates economies of scale and promotes technological innovation.
          Another concern of this literature is the effect of population growth on the labor market and
its consequences on social security systems, which may face difficulties if the ratio of pensioners
per worker increases (Kronenberg, 2009; O'Neil et al. 2010; DeWhurst, 2006; Yoon and Hewings,
2006). However, demographic change affects not only variables such as economic growth and the
labor market, but also aggregate consumption and especially the composition of this consumption.
In general, according to O'Neil et al. (2010), population treatment in the literature has been limited
to the direct effects of changes in population size and, according to Park and Hewings (2007), pay
little attention to how population structure can influence economic growth and consumption.
          On the other hand, studies by Park and Hewings (2007), Kronenberg (2009), Dalton et al.
(2008) and Fougère et al. (2007) attempted to decompose population growth in terms of fertility and
mortality components and more importantly, to examine the impacts of age distribution on
economic growth. If individuals have different behaviors at various stages of life, changes in age
structure in the economy can have an immediate effect. For example, a country with a high
proportion of older people may experience lower economic growth because a large proportion of
the resources will have to be allocated to serve a less productive population.
          In the same direction, Dalton et al. (2008) stated that other demographic factors may be
important, such as the indirect effects of scale that may arise through changes in population
composition due to aging, urbanization or other determinants of economic growth. However, with
many economies experiencing demographic changes, it is necessary to consider the impacts of these
changes on the structure of production and consumption.
          According to Kronenberg (2009), it is generally accepted by most economists that the
current pattern of consumption is unsustainable, and the debate revolves around the instruments that
can be used to change it. Often, they forget that in fact, patterns are already changing because of
demographic changes. The process resulting from higher life expectancy rates coupled with lower
fertility rates contributes to changes in consumption patterns.
          These changes in population composition may occur in the coming decades in many parts of
the globe, and their effects on the composition of consumption, notably on energy demand and
emissions are not yet known. The composition of the population can affect consumption patterns
which vary in their indirect energy requirements because of the energy incorporated in the different
consumer goods (Bin and Dowlatabadi, 2005). While such changes may affect energy use and
hence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, analyzes of emissions scenarios have left these issues aside
(Yoon and Hewings, 2006).
          Statistical analyzes of historical data suggest that population growth has contributed to
emissions growth in recent years (Dietz and Rosa, 1997; Cole and Neumayer, 2004; Fan et al.,
2006) and that urbanization, aging, and changes in household size can also affect energy use and
emissions. Nevertheless, according to O'Neil et al. (2010), an explicit analysis of the effects of this
demographic change on emissions in the future has been limited. Although much of the studies
includes assumptions about future population growth, only a few studies have explicitly
investigated the separate effects of demographic changes on emissions (O'Neil et al., 2010).
Families can affect emissions directly through consumption or indirectly through the effects on the
sectors of the economy via the production chain.
         As observed by Dewhurst (2006), the consumption pattern of the younger and older is
different. Thus, a general result of studies on patterns of consumption is the observation that people
of different age groups have different consumption patterns. Retirees do not exhibit the same
pattern of consumption as those currently employed and parents with younger children have
different demands from those who have older children. Any aging population will shift demand
patterns from younger people to older people, increasing demand for some goods and services, and
decreasing demand for others. This change in consumption pattern and the consequent multiplier
effect across the economy will show opportunities for expansion for some sectors and contraction in
others (Dewhurst, 2006).
         In the Brazilian case, Wong and Carvalho (2006) pointed out a differentiated growth
predicted for the population of active age in the coming decades. Brazil is in an advanced stage of
transition for both mortality and fertility, which makes it possible to predict that the population of
the elderly over 65 will increase at an accelerated rate (2 to 4% per year), while the young
population will decrease (Nasri, 2008). This transition began in the 1960s with the reduction of
fertility that began in the most privileged population groups and in the more developed regions. In
the future, the population will stabilize, but it will become older and with a low, perhaps even
negative, growth rate.
         According to data from the IBGE (2010), the 5- to 9-year age group declined from 14 to
12% between 1970 and 1990. In this period, the presence of children under 5 years of age was
reduced from 15 to 11%. In the year 2000, each of these groups came to represent 9% of the total
population. On the other hand, the age group of people over 65 years old increased from 3.5 in 1970
to 5.5% in 2000. By 2050, this age group is expected to account for about 19% of the Brazilian
population. These facts will lead to a change of pattern in the Brazilian population pyramid. Figure
1 illustrates the change in the 2010 Brazilian age pyramid to the projection of 2050.

         Figure 1 shows an increase in the participation of older people in the total population of
Brazil. This projected demographic change affects final demand, which in turn generates
repercussions on the production structure of the economy, that is, the participation of some sectors
in total production. Kronenberg (2009) argues that there is reason to believe that changes in
consumption induced by demographic changes will also affect energy use and GHG emissions. For
example, older people generally consume more heat energy and less gasoline than young people
because they tend to be more sensitive to cold and use the car less often. This and other changes are
likely to affect GHG emissions in Brazil.
         In this context, this article aims to estimate the changes in the pattern of consumption in
Brazil due to the changes projected in the age pyramid in 2050 and the consequences of these
changes on CO2 emissions. For this, projections will be made using a recursive dynamic
computable general equilibrium model (CGE) considering 65 sectors and 7 age groups for the
Brazilian economy. As far as we know, this is an unprecedented study for Brazil, being the first to
attempt to evaluate the impact of the population aging on consumption patterns and CO2 emissions.
The dynamic CGE model can capture both the direct effects of this change, the indirect effects via
inter-sectoral linkages and the substitution effects over time. Another advance of the research is to
make the analysis more appropriate estimating different elasticities by age groups and sectors.

   2. Evidence from literature

        Dietz and Rosa (1997) stated that the increasing GHG concentration threatens to produce
significant changes in the global climate. There is a scientific consensus that increasing GHG
concentrations are a consequence of human activity all over the globe. In this context, the authors
developed a stochastic model called Impact (Population, Wealth, and Technology - IPAT) to
estimate the effects of population, wealth and technology on CO2 emissions. Their results showed
that population growth, in this case, not considering their age distribution, tends to aggravate GHG
emissions.
        Cole and Neumayer (2004) used econometric panel data methods to estimate the
relationship between two pollutants and demographic factors, as well as population size. For CO2
emissions, the authors have found evidence that population growth causes a proportional increase in
emissions, corroborating the findings by Dietz and Rosa (1997).
        Fougère et al. (2007) evaluated the sectoral impacts of ageing population in Canada arising
from the combination of two structural changes and the labor market but did not assess GHG
emissions from these changes. The first is the negative shock of labor supply due to lower labor
force growth. The second is the change in the composition of consumption due to the increase in the
proportion of older consumers. The analysis is made using an occupational and sectoral computable
general equilibrium model with overlapping generations. The main result of the study is that
although the negative supply shock is dominant, there are also some important sectoral shifts due to
changes in final demand. For example, sectoral participation of health services in total GDP is
expected to increase by approximately 50% from 4.8% of GDP in 2000 to 7% in 2050.
        Dewhurst (2006) assessed the effects of population ageing in Scotland without considering
their impacts on GHG emissions. Considering that consumption patterns differ according to the
average age of family members, he has disaggregated the household income column into three
subsectors: (i) younger families (head of household under 65 years); ii) mature families (head of
household between 65 and 74 years); and (iii) older families (head of 75 years or older). The study
also used projections of changes in household composition to predict changes that can be expected
in consumption. Keeping the income fixed, an increase of older families and a decrease of younger
families would reduce the final demand for some commodities and increase for other commodities.
        Other studies have attempted to assess the effects of demographic changes, notably
population ageing, on the economy and GHG emissions. According to Fan et al. (2006), all
countries share the responsibility of limiting the rapid growth of GHG emissions to try to mitigate
the effects of climate change around the world. To achieve this goal efficiently, researchers are
concerned about the factors that impact on CO2 emissions and the extent of those impacts.
        There are two distinct perspectives on the impacts of population growth on the environment
quality: the Malthusian tradition and the Boserupian approach. The first one states that
environmental degradation happens because of the pressure that the population puts in the
resources. In contrast, the Boserupian perspective (Boserup, 1981) states that population growth
encourages the emergence of technological innovations which attenuate the negative impact on the
environment. Consequently, Malthusians predict that the impact of the population on GHG
emissions is more than proportional, while Boserupians claim that this relationship does not exist,
or if does, has a negative elasticity (Fan et al., 2006).
        In this sense, Fan et al. (2006) investigated the impact of population, wealth and technology
on CO2 emissions from countries with different income levels from 1975 to 2000, using the
STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology)
econometric model. Their results showed that globally, economic growth has the greatest impact on
CO2 emissions. The proportion of the population aged 15-64 has a negative impact on emissions in
countries with higher income levels and a positive impact on emissions from countries with other
income levels.
        Dalton et al. (2008) analyzed how the age composition of US households may, in the
coming decades, affect energy use and CO2 emissions. For this, they incorporated the age structure
of the population into a dynamic computable general equilibrium model with multiple
heterogeneous families. The model is used to estimate and compare the effects of population ageing
and technical changes on the trajectory of energy use and CO2 emissions. The results showed that
the population aging can contribute to the reduction of emissions in the long term by almost 40% in
a scenario of low population growth. The effects of population ageing on emissions may be greater
than the effects of technical changes in some cases.
        Kronenberg (2009) estimated the impact of demographic change in Germany on energy use
and GHG emissions. The author used microdata of household survey to identify age-specific
consumption patterns and projected the impact of demographic change on the consumption
structure by 2030 using an environmental input-output model. His results suggest that, by 2030,
demographic change will increase the share of methane of total GHG emissions and will not
contribute to reduce energy use and emissions in Germany. The author also evaluated two distinct
policy scenarios: a redistribution of income from working-age families to older families, and a
policy of replacing the use of private vehicles to public transportation. The first policy did not have
a significant impact on emissions while the second policy helped to reduce both energy use and
emissions.

   3. Methodology
   3.1 Theoretical Structure of the CGE model

         The general equilibrium model used in this study was ORANIGBR-HOU. It is a model
developed for the Brazilian economy that starts from the theoretical structure of the Australian
model ORANI-G (Horridge, 2011) with a disaggregation of the household consumption vector by
different age groups. The model was calibrated with 2010 data from the Brazilian national accounts
and the input-output matrix. In addition, a recursive dynamics module was introduced that allows
the implementation of simulations in which the stock of capital accumulates over time, just as the
labor market presents a certain inertia in the adjustment of wages and employment.
         The model has 65 sectors and 65 commodities, five components of final demand
(household consumption, government expenditure, investment, exports and inventories), two
elements of primary factors (capital and labor) and two margins (trade and transportation). The
model also has a disaggregation of the consumption vector into seven age groups (better
explanation in section 2.4).
         ORANIGBR-HOU is composed of blocks of equations that determine demand and supply
relationships according to optimization hypotheses and market equilibrium conditions. In addition,
several national aggregates are defined in these blocks, such as aggregate employment, GDP, trade
balance and price indices. Productive sectors minimize production costs subject to a technology of
constant scale returns in which combinations of intermediate inputs and primary factor (aggregate)
are determined by fixed coefficients (Leontief). There is substitution via prices between domestic
and imported goods in the composition of the inputs via a constant substitution elasticity function
(CES). There is also substitution between capital and labor in the composition of the primary factors
through CES functions.
         In the model, households consume domestic and imported goods. The choice between
domestic and imported is carried out by a CES specification (Armington hypothesis). The treatment
of household demand is based on a combined CES/Klein-Rubin preference system. Thus, utility
derived from consumption is maximized by this utility function. This specification represents the
linear spending system (LES), in which the share of expenditure above the subsistence level for
each good represents a constant proportion of the total subsistence expenditure of each family.
          Government expenditure is exogenous. The demand for exports is defined in the usual
way, that is, as a decreasing function of the effective price of export goods given the export
elasticity. In turn, the variation of inventories accompanies the production level of the sectors, and it
is also possible to treat it as exogenous.
          The model operates with market equilibrium for all goods, both domestic and imported, as
well as in the factor market (capital and labor). The purchase prices for each of the use groups
(producers, investors, households, exporters and government) are the sum of basic values and sales
taxes (direct and indirect) and margins (trade and transportation). Sales taxes are treated as ad
valorem rates on the basic flows. The demands for margins (transport and trade) are proportional to
the flows of goods to which the margins are connected. The production structure considers that each
industry can produce several products (secondary production), using the inputs (domestic and
imported) and the productive factors (capital and labor).
        The ORANIGBR-HOU model has a recursive dynamic specification, in which investment
and capital stock follow mechanisms of accumulation and intersectoral displacement from pre-
established rules, associated with depreciation and return rates. Thus, one of the modifications to
make ORANIGBR-HOU dynamic is to link annual investment flows to capital stock. The labor
market also presents an element of intertemporal adjustment which involves variables such as real
wages, current employment and trend employment.


   3.2 Disaggregation of consumption vector in age groups

         This paper uses Consumer Expenditure Survey data set for the years of 2008/2009 to
estimate the association between household expenditure composition and the presence of children
and elderly individuals in households. This survey is carried out by the Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística). The main aim of this
survey is to estimate household consumption expenditure in order to subsidize the build of the
National Consumer Price Index (INPC).
         The 2008/2009 survey contains information about the population living in urban and rural
areas in Brazil. Its sample is representative for the 27 federal units, nine metropolitan areas, as well
as for the whole country. The sample size included 190, 159 individuals living in 55,970
households. Data collection is conducted through six questionnaires, five of them are organized
according to type of expenditure: 1) household and residents characteristics; 2) collective
expenditure in durable household goods 3) collective expenditure in food and cleaning, 4)
individual expenditure; 5) individual earnings and wages. The last questionnaire investigates living
conditions perception (IBGE, 2004).
         In order to analyze aging effect on expenditure composition it is necessary to classify
households according to the presence of elderly residents and children. The classification of
households is done taking into account the number of adults (residents aged from 15 to 59 years
stratified into two age groups), elderly persons (residents aged over than 59 stratified into three age
groups) and children (residents aged from 0 to 14 years stratified into three age groups) in the
household. The disaggregation of elderly individuals and children by age is important to allow the
use demographic projections.
         Seven types of households were defined: households with only two adults; households with
two adults and one child (0-4 years old, 5-9 years old, 10-14 years old); households with two adults
aged from 15 to 49 and one adult aged from 50 to 59; households with two adults aged from 15 to
49 years and one elderly aged from 60 to 69 and finally two adults aged from 15 to 49 years and
one elderly over 70´s. Households including only two adults (15-49) were considered as the
reference category for the comparison of expenditure composition. In order to allow the
identification of aging effect, households with elderly and children living together were excluded
from the sample. The seven groups of households defined in our typology represents 20% of the
total sample (48.470 households) surveyed by POF in 2008/2009, that is, 12,144 households. Table
1 reports the distribution of households according to each group. The largest group corresponds to
households with only two adults (4,335 observations).

    3.3 Households elasticities estimation

       The association between household age structure and consumption composition was
estimated through econometric models on Santiago (2014) for each household group and each type
of product. It was run allowing the estimation of household- type semi-elasticity. All consumption
items present in Expenditure Consumption Survey were aggregated into 15 groups of products. For
groups of products which are considered as individual expenditure (15 products), initially it was
calculated the average cost of each product, represented as:
                  𝑔𝑡
        𝑔𝑚𝑖 = 𝑝𝑜𝑝 𝑖                                                                              (1)
                         2010


      Where: 𝑔𝑚𝑖 is the average spent on product 𝑖, 𝑔𝑡𝑖 corresponds to total spent on product 𝑖
and 𝑝𝑜𝑝2010 represents the Brazilian population in the year 2010.
      Thus, the estimated cost with product 𝑖 can be represented by the equation:

marginal effect of adult spent among 15-59 years old is equal to zero, since this group is used as a

         In addition to data from input-output matrix, CGE models use estimates of elasticities and
parameters, called behavioral parameters, in their calibration. Such values are usually extracted
from the literature, which is justified by the scarcity of data for the estimation. One of the
parameters related to the household structure is the elasticity of expenditure (EPS). In this work,
econometric estimates were based on the model proposed by in Santiago (2014) to estimate these
elasticities considering 15 product groups from the 2008/2009 POF microdata, by age groups. After
this, the 15 aggregates were distributed in the 65 products of the model.

    3.4 CO2 Emissions

        One of the goals of this article is to estimate the emissions resulting from the aging process
of the Brazilian population. To meet this objective a vector of CO2 emissions intensity was
calculated. Then we are going to calculate what will be the change of the emissions in the
production and consumption structure of the Brazilian economy caused by the change in the age
pyramid. For this, we used data from Energy Balance for Brazil in 2010 (EPE, 2011). The first step
was to disaggregate the sectors of BEN, 22 sectors2 into the 65 sectors considered in the
ORANIGBR-HOU model. The method to disaggregate the sectors is the one proposed by Montoya
et al. (2014). Basically, the idea behind this method is to create a set of subsectors considering the
65 of the EGC model for each of the large sectors in BEN. Thus, it is considered that the energy
consumption of the subsectors in toe (tonne oil equivalent) is proportionally related to their
monetary flows contained in the IO (Montoya et al., 2014).
         The second step of this stage was to convert the energy coefficients (in 1,000 toe) into CO2
emissions (Gg) due to the use of fuels by the various sectors of the economy. For this, the
conversion coefficients found in Economy & Energy (2002) were applied. Finally, to calculate the
intensity vector, the total emissions of each of the 65 sectors were divided by their respective values
of production. This vector will be used at the end of the simulations with the ORANIGBR-HOU
model to design the changes in the emissions that can be caused by the change in the age pyramid
that would be in the Brazilian economy. The hypothesis is that no technological innovation occurs,
that is, the emissions vector does not change in 2050 and emissions are linear to production.


    4. Simulations

         In this section, we present the simulation strategies used to estimate the economic effects
of changes in the pattern of consumption in Brazil due to the changes projected in the age pyramid
in 2050 and the consequences of these changes on CO2 emissions.
         Firstly, a baseline scenario for the Brazilian economy is built from 2010 to 2050. It is a
trend scenario for the Brazilian economy in which deviations from it can be measured, estimating
the effects of specific policies. The baseline represents a growth trajectory of the Brazilian economy
between 2011 and 2050 in which no demographic change occurs.
         Before the simulation of the baseline scenario, we need to define the model closure3. It is
assumed that household consumption follows national income and that government expenditure
follows household income. In addition, the share of the nominal trade balance over nominal GDP is
exogenous. We also have the population growth and the imported price index as exogenous
variables. The model works with relative prices and the price variable chosen as numeraire was the
Consumer Price Index.
         After determining the closure, the baseline was divided into two periods. In the first period,
from 2011 to 2015, the main macroeconomic aggregates, real GDP, investment, household
consumption, government expenditure and export volume are considered exogenous. The objective
is to update the main macroeconomic variables according to observed data in the period. Table 2
shows those indicators:

 The closure of the model is the determination of the endogenous and exogenous variables of the simulations performed.
Then represents the assumptions about the functioning of the economy and its adjustments and shocks (policies).
ORANIGBR-HOU is a dynamic model and allows the accumulation of capital over time and adjustments in the labor
market.
         In the second period of the baseline scenario, from 2016 to 2050, only real GDP is kept
exogenous. This part of the baseline presents a path of economic growth of 2.5% per year for the
period from 2016 to 2050 and represents the projection that is compared to the policy scenario
(population ageing).
         The second step was to perform the policy simulation. To do this, in the policy scenario,
we considered all main macroeconomic indicators as endogenous variables. The scenario aims to
evaluate the impact on the Brazilian economy of the change in the age pyramid according to IBGE
projections. Table 3 presents the scenario projected for the seven age groups considered in the
ORANIGBR-HOU model.

   5. Analysis of the results

   5.1 Sectoral results

        The policy results presented here are reported as the cumulative percentage deviation (2020
to 2050) relative to the baseline scenario. Table 4 presents the projected results of activity level
when the change of the age pyramid occurs. As the consumption pattern changes the sectors output
of the economy will change indirectly via production chain. As we can see, the most benefited
sectors are Other Food Industry, Domestic Services, Personal Services, Associative Organizations,
Meat, Real State Activities and Livestock.
        The most negative impact occurred in sectors as Financial Intermediate and Insurance,
Private Education, Biodiesel, Clothing, Furniture and Other, Food and Textile.
        It is worth to note that with the ageing of population, the sector Electricity (1.68%) is
growing around two times as the Oil Refining (0.83%)
Regarding the results of sectoral emissions, Table 5 shows that the change of the Brazilian pyramid
would cause an increase of 7,101.82 Gg of CO2, which would represent an additional of a little
more than 1% in relation to the baseline scenario. Although many sectors traditionally emitting CO2
have shown an increase in their levels of activity, it is observed that they have shown a reduction in
the share of total emissions. This is the case of the Cellulose and paper, Oil refining, and
Metallurgy. Although the share of total emissions has not changed much, as they are very polluting
sectors, the small reduction of their activity in the total Brazilian economy contributes to a small
increase in emissions. On the other hand, sectors that are not very emitting and which are highly
important in the Brazilian economy, such as Trade and Construction, increased relative
participation, which possibly contributed to the low increase of emissions in the Brazilian economy.

3.2 Household Consumption Results

        Figure 2 shows the change in emissions by age group. It is noted that there is an increase in the
composition of emissions for the older age groups and a reduction of the base of the pyramid, caused by
the projected reduction of the younger groups.

        It is noted that the change in the composition of age groups makes the agricultural, food and
beverage sectors as the activities that households most increase consumption. Financial intermediation
and insurance services, as well as the sectors related to vehicles and transportation equipment, are the
ones that reduce the most in household consumption. Note that households reduce Oil Refining
consumption and increase electricity consumption. An expected result as older household tend to
consume more electricity and less fuel.
        Regarding the emission results, Table 7 shows a reduction in CO2 emissions in the consumption
vector of about 0.25%. That is, the change in the pattern of consumption due to the aging process of the
Brazilian population leads to a reduction of emissions. From the results, it can be observed that the
reduction of consumption in the Oil Refining sector is the one that most contributes to this result, since
there is a decrease in the share of this sector in the total emissions.

4. Final considerations

         In recent years, the debate on issues related to demographic change and its impacts on the
economy has increased. The literature has mainly emphasized the effect of population growth on the labor
market and its possible consequences on social security systems. However, demographic change has no
effect only on variables such as economic growth, labor market and social security, but also on aggregate
consumption, and especially on the distribution of this consumption. The process of population aging thus
contributes to changes in consumption patterns. And consequently, the change in consumption pattern
also causes effects on energy use and GHG emissions.
         In this context, this article sought to estimate and analyze the changes in consumption pattern for
Brazil due to the projected changes in the age pyramid from 2010 to 2050 and the possible consequences
of these changes on CO2 emissions. For this, projections were made using a dynamic computable general
equilibrium model for the Brazilian economy considering 65 productive sectors and 7 age groups.
         The results indicate that demographic change has a significant impact on the structure of
household consumption expenditure considering different age groups. The most important impacts are
observed in the areas of health and education. Household energy use is also significantly affected. In
addition, the change in age structure seems to lead to a less emission-intensive consumption pattern. This
result is mainly due to the decrease in participation in the consumption vector for 2050 of sectors such as
Oil Refining. It is observed, therefore, that the aging population and the changes in the habits of
consumption generate a reduction of the CO2 emissions in 0.25%.
