      This article aims at investigating whether the accumulation of international reserves aects
      real exchange rates (level and volatility) for a set of 57 advanced and emerging economies.
      We apply Panel ARDL (Pooled Mean Group) estimations, for annual data from 1994 to
      2017. Long run results indicate that higher levels of international reserves tend to appreciate
      exchange rate and reduce its volatility. The opposite occurs with lower levels of reserves. Short
      run adjustments for the exchange rate level indicate that an average of 17.2% of a long-run
      deviation is corrected within a month. But volatility is corrected at a much faster rate (61,9%).
      There is also evidence of a signicant role from other control variables (Balassa-Samuelson
      GDP Eect, Ination, Ination Dierential and Financial Development), and partial evidence
      from Monetary Independence. Finally, the accumulation of international reserves seems to
      Granger-cause both level and volatility of real exchange rate.

1    Introduction
Capital ows, accumulation of international reserves and, consequently, exchange rate movements
are key elements in the majority of economies nowadays. They inuence, and are inuenced, by
domestic economic policies such as monetary and scal policies. Foreign reserves, in particular, are
essential to prevent any economy from being severely hit by external shocks. There is no doubt that
any country without a proper amount of reserves can face serious economic problems. On the hand,
high levels of foreign reserves, usually coming from capital inows, can cause considerable impact
on exchange rates. Therefore, there has to be an equilibrium among these important variables, and
a policymaker must be aware that one aects another, and vice-versa.
    In fact, there has been a growing discussion related to analyzing how international reserves aect
real exchange rate (RER) movements. Some of the works have focused on examining exchange rate
levels. For instance, this is the case of Frenkel (1978, 1980), Edwards (1984), Flood et al. (1998),
Rodrik (2006), among others, as we will see in the literature revision.
    Nevertheless, not only is RER level important, but also its volatility is crucial, as reported by
the results found in Hviding et al. (2004) and Vieira et al. (2013), for instance. Volatility is certainly
a considerable source of obstruction for investment and trade and, consequently, economic growth.
However, the majority of articles measures exchange rate volatility by means of a non-conditional
standard deviation. This brings considerable limitations to any empirical analysis and, as a result,
restricts all empirical analysis related to the role of international reserves on the level and volatility
of the exchange rate.
    This article aims to analyze the eect of international reserves on real exchange rate (level and
volatility) for a group of 57 advanced and emerging economies. We rst make use of ARCH-type
models to calculate an accurate exchange rate volatility of each country. Then, together with vari-
ables such as: real per capita GDP, CPI ination rate, ination dierential, monetary independence
index, nancial development, a Panel ARDL Model Approach (Pooled Mean Group) is applied as
our econometric methodology. Our argument is that emerging and developed economies accumu-
late international reserves as a cushion against external shocks, even though those reserves cause
considerable impact on exchange rate, either on level or volatility. For the period ranging from
1994 to 2017, our Panel ARDL cointegration estimations show that a higher level of international
reserves has signicant positive eect on both level and volatility of RER. The opposite applies for
lower levels of international reserves. Our results are also robust for dierent model specications.
When we consider short run adjustments, there are some dierences. While exchange rate level
estimations indicate a monthly correction of 17.2%, on average, of a long-run deviation, exchange
rate volatility estimations show a much faster correction, an average of 61.9% within a month.
Finally, we also nd evidence that the following control variables (Balassa-Samuelson GDP Eect,
Ination, Ination Dierential and Financial Development) aect both level and volatility of ex-
change rate, whereas the inuence coming from Monetary Independence is partial. Last but not
least, our results show that the accumulation of international reserves seems to Granger-cause the
level and volatility of real exchange rates.
    Besides this introduction, this article has four more sections. Section 2 brings the literature
related to the relationship between international reserves and real exchange rate level and volatility.
Section 3 describes the data and econometric approach. Section 4 reports all empirical results, and
the nal section concludes.

2    Literature Review
The literature on the eects of international reserves on real exchange rate is vast and it has been
debated academically for decades. For instance, Frenkel (1978) examines what role international
reserves played under dierent exchange rate regimes (pegged and managed oating). For the
period 1963-1975, his analysis showed a dierence in the demand for reserves between developed
and less-developed countries. The conclusion is that the optimal degree of exchange rate exibility
depends on the stochastic nature of shocks (real and monetary, domestic and foreign shocks, for
instance) faced by the economy. Frenkel (1980) extends his previous analysis until 1979, but nds
no change in the qualitative ndings.
    Edwards (1984) analyzes a sample of developing countries and concludes that not only do
reserves movements respond to monetary factors, but also to dierences between actual and desired
reserves. Therefore, monetary considerations are important for estimating and analyzing models
with international reserves. On a similar topic, Obstfeld et al. (2005) gather more than 130 years
of data to conclude that economic policies related to exchange-rate regime is still constrained by
the monetary policy trilemma (a tradeo among exchange stability, monetary independence, and
capital market openness).
    Jeanne and Ranci√®re (2006) derive a formula an optimal level of foreign reserves for a small
open economy susceptible to sudden stops in capital ows. The authors argue that, with proper
calibrations, their model is able to explain the magnitude of international reserves of many emerging
market economies. Obstfeld et al. (2010) build an empirical nancial-stability model based on
nancial stability and nancial openness and nd that international reserve stocks can be well
predicted by exchange rate policy, nancial openness and access to foreign currency through debt
markets. The size of domestic nancial liabilities that could potentially be converted into foreign
currency is also a good predictor of reserve stocks.
    Aizenman and Lee (2007) show that precautionary motives are important to emerging market
economies, in their accumulation of international reserves. Foreign reserves are usually increased
when a more liberal capital account regime is in place, and they are also important to keep the
economy going when sudden stops are about to happen. Aizenman and Hutchison (2012) nd
that, in spite of having accumulated high amounts of foreign reserves, prior to the crisis, emerging
market countries chose not to lose them during the crisis, relying on more currency depreciation
to absorb the shock.
    Flood et al. (1998) focus on 12 Latin American countries, in the 1970s and 1980s, and show
how cycles in reserves and exchange rate premia may result from leakages between ocial and
parallel foreign exchange markets. Athukorala and Rajapatirana (2003) show that, for the period
ranging from 1985 to 2000, real exchange rate appreciation is much higher in Latin America than
in Asia, despite foreign capital inows to Asian countries being greater, compared to the size of
their economies. For the period ranging from 1980 to 1996, Aizenman and Marion (2003) nd
that, compared to other emerging markets, international reserves of Asian countries depend on the
size and volatility of international transactions, as well as on exchange-rate arrangement and on
political considerations. But results are inconclusive for the period after the Asian nancial crisis,
in 1997.
    Aizenman and Riera-Crichton (2008) examine how real exchange rate is aected by inter-
national reserves, terms-of-trade shocks, and capital ows. The authors nd that terms-of-trade
shocks on RER are cushioned by international reserves. This is important in developing countries,
particularly Asian economies and natural resource exporters. Gosh et al. (2014) focus particularly
on Asian Pacic Rim economies, comparing them with other emerging market economies. Their

                                                  3
results show that such accumulation changed from a cushion against current account shocks, in
the 1980s, to a cushion against capital account shocks, in the 1990s. RIM economies are also more
prone to accumulating reserves against current account exposures, as opposed to capital account
vulnerabilities. But they accumulate more reserves in general.
    Rodrik (2006) argues that the rapid increase in international reserves in emerging market
economies is more related to preventing exchange rate from appreciation and maintaining inter-
national trade competitiveness, than a self-insurance motive. Results also show that the costs of
holding these reserves amount to an average of 1 p.p. of annual GDP in those countries. Reinhart
and Reinhart (2011) examine the accumulation of international reserves of over 100 economies and
nd that emerging market economies tend to limit exchange rate uctuations, but there are a few
controlled experiments. The authors are only able to nd some connection among capital inow
and low foreign interest rates, and tax increases on those inows.
    Pina (2015) investigates the eect of international reserves accumulation in developing countries
based on data from 1970 to 2009. There is a dierent trend for developed (developing) countries
since 1987, revealing lower (higher) levels of international reserves / GDP. The idea is to investi-
gate why these dierent patterns happen. The author argues that adequate levels of international
reserves depend on what central banks do in developing countries: manage ination and exchange
rate and support the nancial sector during periods of crises. The model predicts that distortions
associated to the magnitude of crisis, to ination and to constraints related to central banks are
crucial to the determination of the level of international reserves.
    De Gregorio (2011) argues that reserves play a dissuasive role as countries tend to accumulate
them as a safety cushion, but rarely use them. The author also argues that reserve accumulation
and exchange rate impacts cannot be treated separately. This implies a challenge for central banks,
as oating exchange rate regimes must be coherent with the maintenance of an adequate level of
reserves. Dominguez et al. (2012) focus on a large panel of countries to investigate if dierences
in cross-country economic performance, after the 2008 nancial crisis, could be related to pre-
crisis foreign reserve accumulation, as well as decisions taken during the crisis regarding exchange
rate and reserves. Their results show that those countries which accumulated large amount of
international reserves, before the crisis, were those with higher economic growth, after the crisis.
    Bayoumi and Saborowski (2014) nd that in countries with no capital control, sterilized in-
tervention is fully counterbalanced by private money outow. On the other hand, capital controls
are able to block such outows. Aizenman et al. (2015) nd that previous to the nancial crisis
(from 1999 to 2006), reserve accumulation was related to gross savings in developing and emerging
markets. Results from the post crisis period (from 2010 to 2012) show a higher gross saving as-
sociated with lower foreign reserve holding, whereas emerging market economies with low reserve
accumulation experienced currency depreciation in 2012, due to the announcement of tapering
quantitative easing.
    Regarding volatility, specically, Hviding et al. (2004) focus on a panel of 28 emerging market
economies, over the period ranging from 1986 to 2002. Their results are in line with the assumption
that that holding adequate reserves decreases exchange rate volatility. The importance of real
exchange rate volatility on long-run GDP growth is analyzed by Vieira et al. (2013). The authors
make use of a panel of 82 advanced and emerging economies, for the period 1970-2009, and conclude
that more volatility aects economic growth negatively, and vice versa.

3     Data and Econometric Approach
As mentioned previously, our main aim is to analyze how international reserves inuence the level
and volatility of real exchange rates, by means of a Panel ARDL Model Approach. We make use of
a monthly database which encompasses a group of 57 countries (listed in Table 1), for the period
ranging from 1994 to 2017.
   The following variables will be analyzed:

    ‚Ä¢ lreer: ln of Real Eective Exchange Rate (2010 = 100). A higher (lower) value indicates an
      appreciation (depreciation). Source: BIS.

    ‚Ä¢ volreer: Real Eective Exchange Rate Volatility Estimations via ARCH-GARCH models
      (See Table 1).

    ‚Ä¢ gdp: Real per Capita GDP relative to the US. Source: PENN World Table.

    ‚Ä¢ cpi: CPI Ination Rate (%). Source: IFS-IMF.

    ‚Ä¢ monet: Monetary Independence Index. (Higher/lower values of the index mean more/less
      monetary policy independence). Source: Aizenman, Chinn and Ito (2018).

    ‚Ä¢ f indev : Financial Development. (Higher/lower values for three measures of nancial devel-
      opment indicate a more/less integrated and developed nancial system. Source: Svirydzenka
      (2016).

    It is worth noting that the idea of having ination dierential (cpidif ) as an explanatory
variable is to examine whether or not changes in the real exchange rate are due to movements
in relative prices (domestic and foreign). If the answer is negative, this suggests that the nominal
exchange rate is the variable responsible for those changes. As for gdp, it is going to capture the
Balassa-Samuelson (BS) eect on real exchange rate, as in Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964).
It means that countries with higher (lower) relative per capita income (proxy for productivity)
tend to face real exchange rate appreciation (depreciation) over time.
    The empirical analysis developed in this work is based on Autoregressive Distributed Lag
(ARDL) models applied to cointegration, as proposed in Pesaran and Shin (1999) and Pesaran et
al. (2001). They were chosen due to their advantage over the cointegration tests in non-stationary
variables, such the ones developed by Engle and Granger (1987), Phillips and Hansen (1990) and
Johansen (1991), as well as over traditional VAR models. ARDL models applied to cointegration
also tend to be more ecient to capture the long-run relationship data in small samples, and they
perform well, irrespective of whether variables are stationary I(0), non-stationary I(1), or even
mutually cointegrated (Pesaran and Shin, 1999). Table 7, in the appendix, reports the results of
some panel unit root estimations. There is certainly a mix of I(0) and I(1) variables, which makes
Panel ARDL approach more than appropriate to our analysis.
    Pesaran, Shin and Smith (1999) developed a Pooled Mean Group (PMG) model, which is
based on a cointegrated ARDL framework adapted for a panel data set environment. In fact, PMG
likelihood estimators are used to estimate long-run coecients, capturing the pooling behavior of
homogeneity restrictions, and short-run coecients, by the average across groups used to obtain
means of the estimated error-correction coecients and other short-run parameters (Pesaran, Shin
and Smith, 1999).

                                                 5
     A basic ARDL model can be specied as follows:

                                yit = Œ£pj=1 Œª‚àóij yi,t‚àíj + Œ£qj=0 Œ¥ij‚àó xi,t‚àíj + ¬µi + Œµit                   (1)

where: t = 1, 2..., T identies the period and i = 1, 2, ..., N identies the groups; xit = vector k √ó 1
of explanatory variables for group i; ¬µi = xed eects term; Œªij = scalar of coecients related to
all lagged dependent variables; and Œ¥ij = coecient vectors k √ó 1.
    This econometric methodology is capable of maintaining important information related to short
and long-run properties of a model. Besides, any short-run disequilibrium is seen as an adjustment
process towards the long-run equilibrium. Such adjustments are made through the Error Correction
Form (ECM). By making a re-parametrization of Equation (1), we are able to nd the ECM
equation:

                                        0                                      0

                                                                              ‚àÜ(x)i,t‚àíj + ¬µi + Œµit       (2)

where: œÜi = ‚àí(1 ‚àí Œ£pj=1 Œªij ) is the error correction term for the ith group; Œ≤i = Œ£qj=0 Œ¥ij is the long-
run parameter for for the ith group; Œª‚àóij = ‚àíŒ£pm=j+1 Œªim , j = 1, 2, ..., p ‚àí 1 and Œ¥ij
                                                                                     ‚àó
                                                                                        = ‚àíŒ£qm=j+1 Œªim ,
j = 1, 2, ..., q ‚àí 1
    In our specic case, Panel ARDL (PMG) models are applied in the analysis of the role of inter-
national reserves (% of GDP) for two dierent dependent variables: log of real eective exchange
rate (lreer) and exchange rate volatility (volreer). If we let ¬µ denote a constant and T denote a
time trend, the estimated equations for our baseline panel ARDL models are:

    We will also estimate a second specication for Equations 3 and 4 using ination dierential
relative to the US (cpidif ), instead of ination rate (cpi). Another extension is to include two other
control variables, one at a time, to the baseline model with ination and to the alternative model
using ination dierential (cpidif ): monetary independence (monet) and nancial development
(f indev).

which is return rit of real exchange rate in logs, based on average structures ARMA, and ARCH
GARCH for conditional variance. Once the monthly conditional variance is estimated for the period
Feb/1994-Dec/2017, we average the results to obtain annual data, as our nal measure of volatility.
   Table 1 summarizes the models for each of the 57 countries. GARCH (1, 1) structures seem
to prevail over other ARCH-Type models. For the average structure, there is predominance of an
AR(1) structure, with occasional cases for ARMA (1, 1) and AR(2).

4.2    Cointegration Tests

The rst step is to check whether there is a cointegration (long-run) relationship among the vari-
ables specied. In order to do that, we apply Pedroni's Panel Cointegration Tests (Pedroni, 1999),
which can be depicted by the following equation:



                                                      7
                            yit = Œ±it + Œ≤1i x1i,t + Œ≤2i x2i,t + ... + Œ≤M i xM i,t + Œµi,t                                  (6)

where: i) y, x are I(1) variables, by assumption; ii) T is the number of observations over time
(t = 1, 2, ..., T ); iii) N is the number of individuals member in the panel (i = 1, 2, ..., N ); iv) M is
the number of variables (m = 1, 2, ..., M ); v) Œ±i refers to individual eects, which may be set to
zero; vi) parameters Œ≤1i , Œ≤2i , ..., Œ≤M i can vary across individual members of the panel, allowing for
heterogeneous intercepts and trend coecients across cross-sections .
    Once Equation (6) is estimated, the residuals obtained are tested for non-stationarity I(1), by
estimating the following auxiliary regression for each cross-section:


                                   Œµi,t = œÅit Œµi,t‚àí1 + Œ£kk=1
                                                          i
                                                             œÅi,k ‚àÜ(Œµ)i,t‚àík + ¬µi,t                                        (7)

   Pedroni (1999) describes several methods to construct appropriate statistics to test the null
hypothesis of non-cointegration œÅi from the residuals' equation. Tables 2 and 3 report both within
and between dimension test statistics. Cointegration is found in at least one of the statistics for all
three estimated models, regardless of using either ination (cpi) or ination dierential (cpidif ).
Cointegration seems to be much stronger when the dependent variable is exchange rate volatility
(volreer). Therefore, the evidence suggests a long run equilibrium relationship among real eective
exchange rate (level and volatility) and all other control variables.

4.3    PMG Results

Given the long run relationship found, we move forward and analyze the long and short run coef-
cients estimated. Firstly, we estimate a baseline Model 1, controlling for the role of GDP (gdp)
(Balassa-Samuelson eect), international reserves/GDP (reserv) and ination (cpi). In Model 2
monetary independence (monet) is added to the baseline model, while degree of nancial develop-
ment (f indev) is added to Model 3.
    Table 4 reports the PMG long-run coecients having lreer as dependent variable. Concerning
our main variable of interest, which is international reserves (reserv), the estimated coecients
are statistically signicant in all six models. Positive coecients are found in Models 1, 2, 4
and 5, which is line with the idea that higher (lower) levels of international reserves tend to
appreciate (depreciate) exchange rate. This is an indication that a country has enough international
reserves to face any external shock and it is also a common sign that the country has no external
adjustment problems. On the other hand, negative coecients are found in Models 3 and 6. This
is also a possible result in a situation where countries have the ability to keep the exchange rate
at a more depreciated level, as a key issue for stimulating the exports sector (export-oriented
growth strategies). For instance, China has done this and, as a result, it has built up a huge
amount of international reserves. Besides that, Models 3 and 6 are the ones which include nancial
development (f indev) as a control variable. As f indev is related to integration and nancial system
development level, one possible explanation for the reserv variable showing a negative coecient
might be associated to other issues, such as countries with growth strategies based on keeping
exchange rates at a more depreciated level, with positive impact on trade balance and on the levels
of international reserves.
    Regarding the coecients related to ination (cpi), they are all statistically signicant with
positive estimated coecients, indicating that a higher (lower) ination tends to appreciate (de-
preciate) exchange rate. Although a negative coecient would be usually expected, meaning that
higher (lower) levels of ination are associated with more depreciated (appreciated) exchange rates,
the positive signs found are also possible. This is due to issues such as more rigid (pegged) exchange

rate regimes and even to cases related to fear of oating (Calvo and Reinhart, 2002).
    Coecients related to ination dierential (cpidif ) are all positive as well, but statistically
signicant in only two out of three estimated models. As in the ination (cpi) case, this suggests
the diculty of countries to keep up with higher levels of ination and not changing exchange rate
at the same pace, which usually leads to appreciated real exchange rates. And again, this can also
be explained by possible fear of oating/fear of ination, when countries try to avoid signicant
changes in the exchange rate or at least to procrastinate them.
    As for the relative per capita income (gdp) estimated coecients, based on the Balassa-
Samuelson hypothesis, the expected positive sign holds in four of the six estimated models (Models
1, 2, 4, and 5). In fact, positive long run coecients is according to expectations and it means
that, if the Balassa-Samuelson eect is in place, higher (lower) levels of per capita GDP, relative
to the US, tend to appreciate (depreciate) exchange rate over time.
    When monetary independence (monet) is used as control variable, it is statistically signicant
in Model 5 with ination dierential (cpidif ), but not in Model 2 with ination (cpi). This negative
estimated coecient suggests that a higher degree of monetary independence is associated to a
more depreciated (appreciated) exchange rate, while a lower degree leads to more appreciation.
In fact, there is no expected sign for the estimated coecients of the monetary independence
(monet) index. A more (less) monetary independence indicates more (less) ability and autonomy
of monetary authorities to adopt instruments to keep exchange rate at an adequate level, and so to
avoid undesirable economic impacts. This might lead to either a more appreciated or depreciated
exchange rate, depending on each country.
    As for the nancial development variable (f indev), it has a positive and statistically signicant
sign in both estimated models (3 and 6). This was as expected and it is a clear indication that higher
(lower) levels of nancial development are usually associated to more (less) advanced economies,
and the exchange rate tends to be more appreciated (depreciated) due to dierences in relative
productivity for advanced vis-√†-vis the emerging/developing economies.
    Table 5 reports the PMG long-run coecients when real eective exchange rate volatility
(volreer) is used as dependent variable. The results related to international reserves (reserv),

our main variable of interest, indicate that the estimated coecients are statistically signicant
in all estimations. According to expectations, negative coecients are found in Models 1, 2, 4
and 5, suggesting that higher (lower) levels of international reserves reduces (increases) exchange
rate volatility. The expected negative coecient is an indication that higher (lower) levels of
international reserves are associated with lower (higher) levels of uncertainty on the exchange
rate market. This makes sense if accumulation of international reserves is thought and used as a
cushion to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility, which is commonly a desirable feature targeted
by policymakers. This is also true when looking at international reserves levels and the ability of
monetary authorities to implement policies/measures to reduce exchange rate oscillations, and so
to reduce volatility. On the other hand, positive coecients are found in Models 3 and 4, when
nancial development (f indev) is used as control variable.
    As for the Balassa-Samuelson (gdp) variable, coecients are negative in all estimated models,
and statistically signicant in four out of six models. This indicates that higher (lower) levels of per
capita income, relative to the US, are associated to lower (higher) levels of exchange rate volatility.
In other words, emerging market economies, with lower levels of income, tend to be more aected
by exchange rate volatility, when compared to advanced countries.
    All ination (cpi) estimated coecients are statistically signicant, with negative signs. This
implies that a higher (lower) ination tends to reduce (increase) exchange rate volatility. Ination
dierential (cpidif ) coecients are negative in Models 4 and 6, and positive in Model 5, whilst
statistical signicance is found in Models 5 and 6. Monetary independence (monet) has positive
estimated coecients, but it is statistically signicant only in Model 5 with ination dierential
(cpidif ). As for nancial development (f indev), it is signicant and positive for both estimated
models (3 and 6), indicating that higher (lower) levels of nancial development are associated with
higher (lower) levels of exchange rate volatility.

   Once the long-run eects have been examined, we go one step further and analyze all short-
run eects, via Error Correction Mechanism (ECM). This is important because, as mentioned
previously, cointegration ARDL models can keep both short and long run properties of a model,
and any short-run disequilibrium is seen as an adjustment process towards the long-run equilibrium.

                                                       11
    Short-run adjustments related to exchange rate level (lreer), reported in Table 4, and exchange
rate volatility (volreer), reported in Table 5, show that all ECM coecients are statistically signif-
icant with a negative sign, conrming a stable long-run relationship between the variables. When
(lreer) is used as dependent variable (Table 4), the Error Correction Mechanism (ECM) ranges
from -0.093 to -0.27, with an average of -0.172. It means that, on average, 17.2% of a short-
run perturbation is corrected within a month. When the dependent variable is (volreer), Table
5 shows that the ECM coecients range from -0.59 to -0.63 (average = -0.619). It means that
between 59.9% and 63.8% of a long-run deviation is corrected within a month. Comparing the
short-run adjustment results, it seems that exchange rate volatility is corrected much faster than
the exchange rate level itself.

4.4    Causality Tests

Finally, we estimate Causality Tests, which can be specied as bivariate regressions in a panel data
framework. Let t denote the time period dimension and i denote the cross-sectional dimension in
a panel data set. Therefore, the bivariate regressions are:


                yit = œÅ0,i + œÅl,i yi,t‚àí1 + ... + œÅk,i yi,t‚àík + Œ¥1,i xi,t‚àí1 + ... + Œ¥k,i xi,t‚àík + ¬µi,t
                                                                                                                (8)
                xit = œÅ0,i + œÅl,i xi,t‚àí1 + ... + œÅk,i xi,t‚àík + Œ¥1,i yi,t‚àí1 + ... + Œ¥k,i yi,t‚àík + ¬µi,t

    We will apply two approaches. The rst one is a standard Granger Causality test, which as-
sumes that all coecients are similar across all cross-sections. In this case, the null hypothesis is:
y does not Granger cause x, and vice versa. The second one, developed by Dumitrescu and Hurlin
(2012), assumes that all coecients are dierent across cross-sections. Therefore, it estimates in-
dividual Granger Causality tests for each cross-section, and calculates the average of individual
tests, considering a statistical signicance (WÃÑ ‚àí statistic) and a standardized WÃÑ ‚àí statistic, called
ZÃÑ ‚àí statistic. In this case, the null hypothesis is: y does not homogeneously cause x, and vice
versa.
    Table 6 reports the causality test results related only to our variables of interests: i) lreer (real
eective exchange rate); ii) volreer (real eective exchange rate volatility); iii) reserv (international
reserves, as % of GDP). Conventional Granger causality tests indicate that there is no Granger
causality for each pair of variables. As for Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality tests, the null hypothesis is
rejected for all pair of tests. Regarding our main focus of analysis (reserv), international reserves
Granger-cause real eective exchange rate (lreer) and its volatility (volreer).

Conclusions
This article aimed at investigating the role of accumulation of international reserves on the level and
volatility of real exchange rates, for a panel 57 advanced and emerging economies. Before estimating
the empirical models, we made use of an ARCH-type methodology to accurately calculate the
exchange rate volatility of each country in the sample. Besides that, the following control variables
were used: ination, ination dierential relative to US, a monetary independence index, a nancial
development measure, real per capita GDP relative to the US. (Balasssa-Samuelson Eect).
    For the period ranging from 1994 to 2017, we used a Panel ARDL Approach to Cointegration
(Pooled Mean Group), as our econometric methodology. There are similarities and dierences
related to how foreign reserve accumulation aects the level and volatility of real exchange rate.
Regarding long run eects, higher levels of reserves usually tend to appreciate exchange rate and
reduce its volatility, whereas lower levels have the opposite eect. These results are in line with
several articles, such as Rodrik (2006) and Reinhart and Reinhart (2011), for exchange rate level,
and Hviding et al. (2004), for volatility issues.
    But short run eects were also estimated and are worth mentioning. Our results show that
exchange rate volatility is corrected at a much faster rate than the exchange rate level itself. In
other words, real exchange rate tends to rstly correct its distribution around a mean value and,
then, it moves towards a desired level.
    We also found evidence that the accumulation of international reserves seems to Granger-
cause both level and volatility of real exchange rate, and that other control variables are also
important is our discussion. This was the case of GDP, as a proxy for the Balassa-Samuelson
eect, ination, ination dierential and nancial development. However, partial evidence was
found when monetary independence as applied as a control variable.
