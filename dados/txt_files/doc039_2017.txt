Abstract

The impact of real exchange rate movements on GDP growth is a hotly debated issue
both in policy and academic circles. In this paper we provide evidence suggesting that
there is not a robust statistical association between misalignment and growth for a
broad panel of countries. Controlling for country fixed effects, time effects and initial
GDP, a more depreciated currency is associated with higher growth. However, this
positive association vanishes after controlling for the savings rate. We do not find such
positive relationship either for large panel of countries or for a subsample of emerging
economies.



Resumo

Há um intenso debate, tanto na academia como entre formuladores de política, acerca
impacto de movimentos na taxa de câmbio real sobre o crescimento do produto. O
presente artigo não encontra evidências de uma associação robusta entre
desalinhamento cambial e crescimento em um amplo painel de países. Controlando
por efeitos fixos de países, efeitos tempo e PIB inicial, uma taxa de câmbio depreciada
está relacionada a maior crescimento. Entretanto, a associação positiva desaparece
após controlarmos pela taxa de poupança. Tal relação não se verifica tanto no painel
amplo de países, como para uma subamostra de economias emergentes.

1    Introduction

In this paper we revisit the exchange rate-growth nexus using panel data estimations. Our …nd-

ings go against the generally accepted view that a more depreciated exchange rate is conducive

to higher growth rates.

    In theory, the e¤ect of deviations of the real exchange rate from its fundamental value on

growth rates is ambiguous. In a model with learning by doing/scale economies, a depreciated

currency can boost growth by temporarily shielding domestic producers from import competi-

tion, thus allowing them to travel up the production learning curve successfully. Additionally,

if a depreciated currency leads to more investment in tradable sectors where long term produc-

tivity prospects are more promising, it could spark higher overall growth rates. On the other

hand, if imported capital goods play a signi…cant role in domestic capital formation, making

them dearer through an undervalued currency may cause a fall in investment and growth rates.

    It is a priori hard to say which e¤ect should prevail, and thus going empirical is crucial.

Rodrik (2008) is a major reference in the empirical literature dealing with this question. Using

data from 1950 to 2004 from Penn World Table (PWT 6.2), he …nds that a measure of exchange

rate misalignment is indeed associated with GDP per capita growth rates: undervalued curren-

cies leading to higher growth rates, and overvalued currencies to lower growth rates. The author

claims this e¤ect is due to currency misalignments in emerging economies (no signi…cant e¤ect

for advanced economies).

    Here we use the same methodology, but employ data from the latest version of the Penn

World Table (PWT 9.0). For a broad panel of countries, we show that the relationship between

real exchange rate deviations and growth vanishes after controlling for an important omitted




                                               2
variable: the savings rate. In a world with imperfect capital markets, internal savings may

matter for growth. For instance, in Aghion et al (2016) model, domestic savings increase the

attractiveness of FDI which boosts growth1 . At the same time, though, higher savings are

associated with smaller current account de…cits and thus with a less depreciated exchange rate.

This implies a positive association between misalignment and growth may simply re‡ect these

two variables’correlation with savings.

       There is large body of research investigating the growth e¤ects of exchange rates. Some

papers emphasize the deleterious e¤ects of overvaluation (Sachs and Warner, 1995; Razin and

Collins, 1997; Easterly, 2005; Rajan and Subramanian, 2011). Rodrik (2008), however, …nds

evidence that not only overvaluation is bad for growth, but also that an undervalued currency

tends to spur growth.

       Using a large panel of countries, he proceeds in two stages. In the …rst stage, he regresses real

exchange rate against per capita income and time …xed e¤ects. Residuals from this regression

are then taken as a measure of undervaluation of the local currency. In the second stage, he

regresses GDP per capita growth against the undervaluation variable and other controls. Here

we follow the same methodology, but use more recent data (1950 to 2014). Furthermore, we

emphasize the role of savings as a possible confounder in the estimation of the undervaluation-

growth relationship.

       Other papers follow this strategy, reaching similar results. Berg and Miao (2010) control for

other possible determinants of the real exchange rate in the …rst stage. As in Rodrik, they …nd

evidence that …rst-stage residuals are highly correlated with GDP per capita growth. Gluzman,

    The logic is that foreign ownership is better protected from expropriation if the company has a domestic
partner: for political economy reasons, the sovereign is less likely to expropriate domestic players, attenuating the
agency problem and rendering FDI ‡ows safer.

Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2012) show that the growth e¤ects of an undervalued currency

work through savings, investment and employment. Levy-Yeyati, Sturzenegger and Gluzman

(2013) …nd evidence that countries intervene to avoid overvaluation, and these interventions are

related to faster growth. Arguably, these e¤ects are particularly strong for developing economies.

    We however …nd no evidence that an undervalued currency is related to higher growth. In

our full panel (which includes developed and developing countries), the e¤ect of undervaluation

on growth is positive, but becomes statistically insigni…cant and its magnitude is substantially

reduced once we add savings as a control. More importantly, we do not …nd evidence that the

e¤ect is stronger for a subsample of emerging economies, contrarily to Rodrik’s …ndings. In all

our speci…cations, once we control for savings, the estimated e¤ect of exchange rate deviations

becomes statistically insigni…cant.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 lays down the methodology used,

section 3 presents the estimates and section 4 brie‡y concludes.



2    Data and methodology

For our benchmark estimations we rely on data from the latest version of the Penn World Table

(PWT 9.0), which encompasses the period between 1950 and 2014. We consider 13 …ve-year

periods: 1950-54, 1954-60, ..., 2010-14. Unless otherwise noted, variables refer to averages across

each period.

    Estimation proceeds in two stages. In the …rst stage we regress the real exchange rate (local

currency/USD) on a set of time dummies and on GDP per capita levels. As in Rodrik (2008),

the idea is to control for Balassa-Samuelson type of e¤ects and global macro shocks.

deviations/misalignments, which are the residuals of the equation above. We call this variable

Dev_RERit .

      The second stage is a stripped-down version of a Barro growth regression with exchange rate

deviations entering as a regressor:



                     git =    + : ln Yit0 + :Dev_RERit + :Savingsit +                i   +   t   + "it       (2)



where git is the average annual growth rate of GDP per capita in period t, country i; Yit0 is the

initial GDP per capita of country i, period t;2                i   and   t   are, respectively, country and time

…xed e¤ects. We include ln Yit0 to capture standard convergence e¤ects. Moreover, Savingsit

is country i’s average savings rate over period t, de…ned as one minus the shares of private

consumption and government consumption in GDP. We run regressions with and without the

savings rate as a control.

      Savings are a possible confounding factor in estimating the exchange rate-growth relation-

ship. Higher savings can both boost growth and contribute to a more devalued currency at the

same time. As shown below, savings and exchange rate deviations are indeed strongly correlated.

Furthermore, the inclusion of savings reduces substantially the magnitude and precision of the

estimated e¤ect of undervaluation on growth.

3     Estimations

3.1    First-stage estimations

Using data from the latest version of the PWT we estimate:



                              ln RERit =     3:778       0:187    ln Yit
                                            (34:17)    ( 16:95)

                                    N   = 1899; R2 = 0:456



where values in parenthesis are robust t-statistics (the regression includes a full set of time

dummies). Our results are very similar to Rodrik’s. GDP per capita is negatively associated with

the log-levels of the exchange rate, meaning more developed economies tend to have stronger

currencies. This is the famous Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect: higher productivity in the tradable

sector increases wages in both tradable and non-tradable sectors, which in turn put a pressure

on non-tradable prices leading to a stronger currency. The statistical signi…cance of this variable,

as in Rodrik, is very high.

    Table 1 displays descriptive statistics on our main variables. We show separate statistics for

emerging economies, which we de…ne as countries with GDP per capita smaller than 70% of

that of the US and larger than USD 1,000 (data from very poor countries are in general less

reliable).

   We have argued above that savings and real exchange rate deviations are likely positively

correlated. Therefore, the e¤ect of undervaluation on growth would be biased upward if savings

were excluded in exchange rate-growth regressions. In our sample, this correlation is indeed pos-

itive and highly signi…cant. Table 2 reports the outputs of panel regressions of RER deviations

against savings (full sets of country and time …xed included). We present results for our full

sample of countries and for the subsample of emerging economies. In both cases the coe¢ cient

of savings is positive and highly signi…cant.

3.2   Second stage estimations

We next report second-stage results (see Table 3). The dependent variable now is the average

annual growth rate multiplied by 100. Column (1) exhibits results for the whole sample, which

combines both developed and developing countries. In addition to the deviation variable, we

include the log of initial GDP per capita plus time and country …xed e¤ects. Using this speci…-

cation, we …nd a signi…cant e¤ect of exchange rate deviations on growth (see column (1)). The

magnitude is large, although somewhat smaller than the one reported by Rodrik (in a similar re-

gression his coe¢ cient of Dev_RER is around 1.7, compared to 1.3 found here). A one standard

deviation increase in this variable is associated to a growth rate higher by 1:318                                              0:454   0:60

percentage points. This is a big number, given mean growth rate in the sample is 2.3%.

   However – and this is the main message from this paper – when we include savings in

our regression (column (2)), the estimated e¤ect of Dev_RER becomes insigni…cant, with the

                                                                            8
magnitude of the point estimate being cut in half.

    We repeat the analysis in column (3) and (4), now removing outliers.3 This time, the

coe¢ cient of RER deviation is insigni…cant even when we do not control for savings. Moreover,

the e¤ect of savings is now large and very precisely estimated. For each percentage point increase

in this variable, we …nd a positive of impact of 0.1 percentage points in the average growth rate.

    Columns (5)-(8) are analogous to columns (1)-(4), but restrict the sample to emerging

economies only. Results are broadly similar. Importantly, we do not …nd stronger growth

e¤ects of devaluations for this group of countries. In some speci…cations (as in columns (5) and

(6)), the estimated coe¢ cients of Dev_RER are actually smaller than those found for the full

sample. In any case, when we control for savings, the e¤ect of devaluations becomes insigni…cant

once again. This stands in sharp contrast with Rodrik’s …nding that devaluations have stronger

growth e¤ects in emerging economies.




   3
     We remove, as outliers, country-period pairs that displayed: (i) average GDP per capita growth rates larger
than 10 or smaller that -5; or (ii) average devaluations rates smaller than -5 or larger than 5; or (iii) average
savings rates smaller than zero or larger than 1.

3.3     Overvaluations versus Undervaluations

Linearity may be a strong assumption: overvaluations can be fundamentally di¤erent from un-

dervaluations in terms of growth impacts –as mentioned, many papers investigate the deleterious

e¤ects of RER overvaluations on growth. To assess the importance of this kind of asymmetric

e¤ect, we estimate the following speci…cation:



      git =   + : ln Yit0 + :Dev_RERit + :Pit         Dev_RERit + :Savingsit +     i   +   t   + "it



where Pit is equal to 1 if Dev_RERit       0 (i.e., currency is undervalued), and equal to zero

otherwise (overvalued currency).

   Now the marginal impact of an overvalued currency is captured by coe¢ cient , whereas

the impact of an undervalued currency is given by         + : Table 4 displays the results of this

exercise. We only show regressions that include savings as a control variable. For our full

sample of countries, the coe¢ cients of both Dev_RER and the interaction variable are statis-

tically insigni…cant (columns (1) and (2) below). In other words, we …nd neither evidence that

undervaluations are good for growth, nor that overvaluations are bad growth.

   Columns (3) and (4) report the same estimations for our sample of emerging economies. In

column (3) we actually see a positive impact of overvaluations on growth ( > 0) and negative

impact of undervaluations on growth ( +      < 0). However, these coe¢ cients may capture the

fact that crisis periods in emerging markets are both characterized by low growth and capital

‡ight (giving rise to undervaluations); and in large expansions we should observe the opposite.

Indeed, when we exclude outliers (in particular, very large overvaluations and undervaluations),

the coe¢ cients of Dev_RERit and Pit        Dev_RERit become once again insigni…cant (see

4    Concluding remarks

In this short paper we investigate the impact of real exchange rate misalignments on growth. We

follow closely Rodrik (2008), which …nds evidence that a depreciated real exchange rate tends to

boost growth, based on a panel of countries. His results are particularly strong for a subsample

of developing economies.

    Here we use a more recent version of PWT data, while emphasizing the importance of

controlling for domestic savings. The exclusion of this variable may bias upward the e¤ect of

the real exchange rate, since higher savings can both increase growth and contribute to a more

depreciated currency. Indeed, in our sample, RER deviations and savings are strongly correlated.

    For a broad panel of countries, we do …nd that RER deviations are positively associated

with growth. However, this e¤ect becomes statistically insigni…cant when we include savings as

a regressor. This also holds true for a subsample of emerging economies. We also estimate an

alternative speci…cation which allows for di¤erent e¤ects of undervaluations and overvaluations

on growth. We do not …nd robust growth e¤ects in either case.

    To summarize, contrarily to Rodrik’s famous result, we do not …nd evidence that RER

misalingments matter for growth, either for a broad set of countries or for a subsample of

emerging economies.
