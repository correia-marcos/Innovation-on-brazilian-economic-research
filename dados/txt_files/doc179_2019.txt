Abstract
It is recognized that irrigated agriculture is an effective tools to combat poverty and income distribution,
generating employment at lower costs than those in other sectors of the economy, resulting in an increase in the
supply of food at lower prices than those produced in non irrigated area, as well as the significant increase in
productivity of land and labor factors. Thus, the objective of this research is to identify the effect of irrigation on
the productive performance, in terms of technical efficiency, of Brazilian agricultural producers. The data used
refer to the farm level data of the Agricultural Census of 2006, accessed directly in the Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The approach used combines the stochastic production frontier (SFA), taking
into account the selection bias in irrigation adoption (Heckman's approach), with the Entropy Balancing
technique. The results show that irrigators are, on average, 5.3 percentage points more efficient than rain-fed
farmers. The analysis by farm-size showed that, in both groups, the small producers are more efficient than the
others, evidencing a U-inverted relationship between technical efficiency and farm-size. However, the greatest
difference observed in efficiency scores between irrigators and rain-fed farmers was for large producers, which
implies that irrigation technology has a significant effect on the efficiency gain for this group. Finally, the research
brings results that can help the design of public policies directed to irrigated agriculture, with the aim of achieving
greater rural development.

Resumo
É reconhecida que a agricultura irrigada é uma efetiva ferramenta de combate à pobreza e distribuição de renda,
gerando empregos a custos inferiores a aqueles em outros setores da economia, resultando em aumento da oferta
de alimentos a preços mais baixos daqueles produzidos nas áreas não irrigadas, bem como o aumento expressivo
da produtividade dos fatores terra e trabalho. Assim, o objetivo da presente pesquisa foi identificar o efeito da
irrigação sobre o desempenho produtivo, em termos de eficiência técnica, dos estabelecimentos agropecuários
brasileiros. Os dados utilizados referem-se aos microdados do Censo Agropecuário de 2006, acessados
diretamente na sala de sigilo do Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). Para tal, foi utilizada uma
abordagem que combina a estrutura de fronteira de produção estocástica, levando em conta o viés de seleção na
adoção da irrigação (abordagem de Heckman), com a técnica de balanceamento por entropia. Os resultados
mostram que os irrigantes são, em média, 5,3 pontos percentuais mais eficientes que os produtores de sequeiro. A
análise por tamanho do estabelecimento mostrou que, em ambos os grupos, os pequenos produtores são mais
eficientes do que os demais, evidenciando uma relação de U-invertido entre a eficiência técnica e o tamanho da
fazenda. Entretanto, a maior diferença observada dos escores de eficiência entre irrigantes e produtores de
sequeiro foi para os grandes produtores, indicando que a tecnologia de irrigação tem efeito significativo no ganho
de eficiência para este grupo. Por fim, a pesquisa traz resultados que podem auxiliar o delineamento de políticas
públicas direcionadas a agricultura irrigada, com o intuito de alcançar um maior desenvolvimento rural.

1. Introduction

     The great variability of precipitation in Brazilian regions led farmers to adopt irrigation to mitigate the
adverse effects of climate change. In relation to the implementation of irrigation systems, there is the
development of Brazilian agricultural sector, which is one of the main economic activities in the
generation of employment and income, being able to raise the standard of living of the population
regarding poverty reduction and food security.
     Irrigation systems development is an important technology through which agricultural productivity
rates can be increased (Dridi and Khanna, 2005); it also has potential to minimize the risks caused by
climate change, which is associated with one of the main causes of agricultural production vulnerability
(Kurukulasuriya et al., 2006). Irrigation adoption can be used as a tool to reduce dependency on variable
rainfall and water availability (Tubiello, 2005); decreasing the uncertainty surrounding crop yields and
securing income and employment in the rural areas (Marra et al., 2003).
     Cunha et al. (2014) analyzed the irrigation adoption as an adaptive strategy under climate change
scenarios in Brazil. They concluded that irrigation adoption is affected by climate change, and is used as a
response to the reduction in precipitation. Although adoption is not uniform across Brazilian regions,
irrigation technology adoption is expected to increase in the next 30 years for all regions. Since
agricultural sector is said to be the sector most affected by climate change (Rosenzweig et al., 2014),
irrigation adoption is used as an adaptive strategy (Finger et al., 2011; Van Passel et al., 2017)
     Irrigation systems are increasingly becoming more efficient (Evans; Sadler, 2008; Schaible; Aillery,
2012). Testing the ability of irrigation systems to alleviate water scarcity is an important research agenda
that can provide useful information to policymakers (Koundouri et al., 2006). As argued by Njuki and
Bravo-Ureta (2016), the greatest interest lies on the arid and semi-arid regions, where non-uniform
precipitation constrains the natural development of crops. In addition, the competition for existing
freshwater supplies requires maximizing water productivity in crop production (Pereira et al., 2003;
Sepaskhan et al., 2006).
         Despite of all benefits related to irrigation technology adoption in agriculture, there is a low
percentage of farmers that use irrigation in Brazil, around 6.3% (IBGE, 2009), which generates an
uncertainty regarding the effects of this practice on the farmers’ productive performance. The uncertainty
lies on the effects of irrigation on technical efficiency among irrigators and rain-fed farmers for different
farms sizes, which might respond differently to irrigation adoption as adaptive strategy to climatic
variability and regard to irrigation efficiency and effectiveness (Vanschoenwinkel; Van Passel, 2018),
being small farmers and poorer populations most affected (Vanderlugt, 2011). Moreover, as farm size
increases, the feasibility, implementation, operations and management of irrigation systems may become
increasingly complex; this may compromise farmers’ performance. However, this is a hypothesis that
must be tested. The farm size has been discussed in the literature because of its influence on production,
efficiency and productivity (Rada, Helfand and Magalhães, 2019).
         Irrigation technology allows the farmer achieve higher yields maintaining the amount of others
inputs constant, that is, the capacity to move farmers toward the best practice, known as potential
production. This movement toward the efficient frontier is termed as technical efficient improvement.
Technical efficiency estimates are often used to design programs for performance improvement, which
involve changes to the management (e.g., education and training programs) and structure of the firm, as
operating environment (O´Donnell et al., 2008).
     Despite the fact that most of irrigation projects come from private initiatives, irrigation adoption has
received governmental attention regarding the development of projects and provision of credit to rural
producers (ANA, 2009). The goal is to adapt to climate variation and increase returns of production and
profitability. Technical efficiency difference between irrigators and rain-fed farmers could justify an
increase in investments and support by governmental policies to encourage the adoption of irrigation
technology, generating economic development of rural Brazil, especially in areas of climatic and
socioeconomic vulnerability.
     Bravo-Ureta et al. (2012) argue that one of the main limitations of the approach adopted to estimate
technical efficiency is not to consider the endogenous characteristics of some variables, such as irrigation
                                                                                                              2
adoption, since the adoption is an individual choice of the farmer, which can be affected by observable
factors (e.g. farm and producer characteristics, such as income, schooling, experience, etc.) and
unobservable factors (e.g. farmer managerial capacity). Villano et al. (2015) point out that by
disregarding these characteristics, the results may be biased, which limits the analysis of the true effect of
irrigation adoption on farmer’s performance.
     Given the lack of studies on agricultural technical efficiency comparing irrigation adopters and non-
adopters in Brazil, the objective of this research is to fill in this gap in the literature and identify the effect
of irrigation on the technical efficiency of irrigators and rain-fed heterogeneous farmers differentiated by
farm size due to complexity of irrigation systems management. In this context, one of the contributions of
this research is to mitigate some limitations evidenced in the literature through an empirical strategy that
combines the stochastic frontier approach with a method that considers the effects of endogenous sample
selection. Thus, this study aims to answer three questions: Are irrigators more efficient than rain-fed
farmers in Brazil? What is the relationship between technical efficiency and farm size for both groups?
And for which farm size irrigation adoption generates greater difference in technical efficiency between
irrigators and rain-fed farmers?
     Our findings indicate that irrigation technology adoption increase farmers’ technical efficiency, which
irrigators are 5.3 percentage points more efficient than non-adopters, on average. We found an inverted
U-shaped relationship between technical efficiency and farm size for both groups, where small farms are
more efficient. However, irrigation adoption has a slightly greater effect for large farms in terms of
technical efficiency.
     This research is organized in five sections besides this introduction. In the following section we
present a brief literature on technical efficiency and irrigation. The empirical model is presented in
Section 3; Empirical application and data source are presented in Section 4. Results are shown in Section
5, and finally, in Section 6 we expose our finals conclusions about the research.


2. Technical Efficiency and Irrigation

     Technical efficiency differences between irrigators and rain-fed farmers were assessed in several
studies. Anang et al. (2017) compared technical efficiency of smallholder irrigated and rain-fed rice farms
in Northern Ghana. On average, the irrigators were 9.2% points more efficient than the rain-fed farmers.
The authors reinforce the need for investment in irrigation infrastructure as a mechanism to reach poverty
reduction and food security.
     Babatunde et al. (2017) examined the determinants of yield gap and technical efficiency between rain-
fed and irrigated rice production in Nigeria. The result showed that irrigated rice producers were around
11% points more technically efficient than rain-fed farmers. Opata et al. (2018) also found that irrigators
were 38 p.p. more technically efficient than rain-fed farmers in rice production in Nigeria. Mkanthama et
al. (2018) found a great difference in technical efficiency in rice production in Tanzania, where technical
efficiency was 96% for irrigators compared to 39% for rain-fed farmers. Low technical efficiency for
rain-fed producers was also found by Makombe et al. (2007), where rain-fed farmers’ technically
efficiency was 6% and for irrigators around 24%.
     On the other hand, there are studies that pointed out opposite findings, where rain-fed farmers are
more technically efficient than irrigator producers. Gebrehaweria et al. (2012) estimated technical
efficiency of irrigated and rain-fed smallholder agriculture in Ethiopia. They found that rain-fed were
82% technically efficient, while irrigators were 45%. They also found that access to credit and number of
skilled household members reduces the technical inefficiency of irrigated agriculture.
     Melesse and Ahmed (2015) compared the technical efficiency between irrigators and rain-fed farmers
in potato production in Eastern Ethiopia. Technical efficiency score for rain-fed farmers was 75% and for
irrigators 50%, while Tiruneh et al. (2017) found an average technical efficiency (TE) of 81% and 68%,
respectively. Factors related to schooling, soil condition and seed size affected TE, while the age of the
household head positively affected the TE of irrigators, indicating that experience through age matters in
production.
                                                                                                                 3
     Also for Ethiopia, Makombe et al. (2017) estimated and compared the levels of production and
technical efficiency of different small-scale farmers. The average technical efficiency for the modern
irrigated system was 71% and for rain-fed 78%. Vrachioli, Stefanou and Tzouvelekas (2018) found
similar findings to Tiruneh et al. (2017), but for farmers that had adopted sprinkler irrigation using data
covering 56 small-scale greenhouse farms from the island of Crete, Greece. Average technical efficiency
to farmers who adopted sprinklers is lower than the group of non-adopters.
     These findings highlight that there is no consensus whether irrigation adoption can make farmers
more efficient compared to non-adopters. This outcome can be explained by the fact that after the
adoption of new technologies, adopters may need more time to learn how to use the technology
efficiently. For Brazilian agriculture, to the best of our knowledge, no research measured and compared
technical efficiency between irrigators and rain-fed farmers; we only found studies for small specific
irrigated areas5.


3. Empiric Model

     Two methodological steps are used to identify the effect of irrigation on farmers’ technical efficiency.
Due to the possibility of selection bias in irrigation adoption from pre-treatment observable
characteristics, the technical efficiency scores comparison between irrigators and rain-fed farmers
becomes impracticable.
     The decision to irrigate is a farmer optimization problem influenced by their personal characteristics,
economic conditions, and climatic factors, among other (Cunha et al., 2015; Vanschoenwinkel; Van
Passel, 2018; Watto; Mugera, 2019). Thus, comparison between irrigators and rain-fed producers would
result in an overestimation of the technical efficiency due to the self-selection bias (Vrachioli, Stefanou
and Tzouvelekas, 2018).
     Entropy Balancing method is appropriate to find a group as similar as possible to the group of
irrigators to eliminate the bias caused by such observable characteristics. Hence, the strategy consists of
estimating the production function using the Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) for each group
considered through the two-stage approach developed by Heckman (1979). The combination of the two
approaches allows us to obtain comparable technical efficiency scores between the groups and within the
groups (according to the farm size), and also free from biases from observable and unobservable
characteristics (Sipiläinen; Lansink, 2005; Freitas, 2017).
     Finally, the production stochastic frontier approach developed by Battese and Coelli (1995) allows us
to model an equation and explain the factors that influence technical efficiency (or its variability) of the
farmers. A similar approach was used by Jiang and Sharp (2015), among others.


3.1. Entropy Balancing
    Hainmueller (2012) developed a multivariate method that allows us to weight a data set such that
variables distributions in the reweighted observations satisfy a set of special conditions of moments, so
that there is an exact equilibrium on the first, second, and larger moments of the distributions of
independent variables in both treatment and control groups. In summary, this method allows the
researcher to specify a desirable level of equilibrium for the covariates, using a set of conditions
associated with the moments of the distribution.
    To demonstrate the weighting procedure proposed by Hainmuller (2012), consider a sample with
observations belonging to the treatment group and     control units, which were randomly selected from a
population of size      and     , respectively (                  ). Let            be a binary treatment
variable, where it assume the value equal to 1 if unit belongs to the treatment group, and 0 otherwise.

                                                                                                                        4
Let be a matrix containing the observations of pre-treatment exogenous variables;           corresponds to
the value of the j-th covariate of unit , such that                      refers to the characteristic vector
of unit and refers to the column vector with j-th covariates.
    The entropy balancing generalizes the propensity score weighting approach by estimating the weights
directly from a set of equilibrium constraints that exploit the researcher's knowledge about the sample
moments. Consider        the weight of the entropy balancing chosen for each control unit, which were
found by the following reweighting scheme that minimizes the entropy metric distance:




subject to the equilibrium and the normalization constraints




        Where               is a basis weight and              describes a set of imposed constraints on
the covariates moments in the reweighted control group. Initially, the covariates are chosen and included
in the re-weighting procedure. For each covariate, a set of balancing constraints (Equation 2) is specified
to match the covariate distributions moments between treatment groups and re-weighted controls. The
moment constraints can be the mean (first moment), the variance (second moment), and the asymmetry
(third moment). A typical balancing restriction is formulated such that         contains the moment of a
specific covariant     for the treatment group. The momentum function for the control group is specified
as:                or                          with mean .
        Thus, to a set of units, entropy balancing looks for weights                   which it minimizes
Equation 1, where is the entropy distance between           and the weight base vector                     ,
subject the balance constraints in Equation 2, normalization constraint (Equation 3), and non-negativity
constraint (Equation 4).
        The moment restriction applied here refers to the imposition that the first moment. Thus, for all
explanatory variables (chosen based on their influence on the irrigation adoption), the method calculates
the means in the treatment group and seeks for a set of entropy weights such that the weighted means of
the control group are similar. Such weights are used in the next steps to obtain unbiased estimates of
selection bias caused by observables factor.


3.2. Sample Selection Model
    The existence of sample selection bias due to the fact that there are factors influencing the irrigators
and rain-fed producers' technical efficiency that are different from those influencing the probability of
adopting irrigation should be verified. The methodological procedure proposed by Heckman (1979)
allows us to verify the possible selection bias mentioned. The method consists in two stages, which a
binary choice model is estimated in the first stage with the purpose of explaining, through the selection
equation, the probability of farmers to adopt irrigation.
    In the second stage, the production stochastic frontier for each group (irrigators and rain-fed farmers)
is estimated. Thus, the Inverse Mills Ratio (obtained in the first step) is incorporated as a covariate with
the purpose of correcting the sample selection bias. We also use the weighting scheme obtained in the


                                                                                                          5
Entropy Balancing to estimate the production function. The existence of the selection bias is confirmed
when the Inverse Mills Ratio is statistically significant (GREENE, 2011).


3.2.1. Selection Equation
    The selection equation proposed by Heckman (1979) is estimated using a Probit model, where the
likelihood of a farmer to adopt irrigation is explained. Let      be a binary variable that represents the
(unobservable) selection criterion as a function of a vector of exogenous variables . The Probit model
can be defined as:



where α is the vector of parameters to be estimated and   is the error term distributed as                   . The
latent variable is observed and receives the value 1 when                 , and zero otherwise:




3.2.2. Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA)
    After weighting the sample using the Entropy Balancing and taking into account the sample
selectivity bias due to the irrigation adoption decision, the production function and then technical
efficiency scores is estimated by the Production Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA).
    The SFA has been widely used in studies of crop efficiency and productivity due to random factors
involved in production that cannot be neglected (Battese, 1992; Coelli, 1995; Bravo-Ureta et al., 2007), as
well as factors which influence the production technical efficiency.
    We follow Battese and Coelli (1995) approach to specify the stochastic frontier that simultaneously
models the technical inefficiency, which can be specified as:



where represents the production value of the i-th farm                        ;    is a vector        of inputs
and other explanatory variables associated with the production of the i-th farm; is a vector                 of
unknown parameters to be estimated; represents the random error term that captures shocks that are out
of producer control (climate, pests and diseases, measurement errors, etc.), which is assumed to be
independent and identically distributed (iid)                   and;      are non-negative random variables
associated to technical inefficiency of production, i.e., it is the part that constitutes a downward deviation
with respect to the production frontier (best practice), which are assumed to be independently distributed,
where it is obtained by truncation (at zero) of a normal distribution with mean           and variance , such
that            .
     Thus, the equation expressed by (7) specifies the stochastic frontier production function in terms of
original production values. Following the specification of Battese and Coelli (1995), the term that
explains the technical inefficiency of production, , can be represented by:



where is a vector             of explanatory variables associated with the technical inefficiency of the i-th
productive unit6; is a vector           of unknown coefficients and;      are random errors defined by the
           7
truncation of a normal distribution with mean zero and variance              . We assume a half-normal
distribution of the error term . This equation can be modeled by specifying that inefficiency component
is heterocedastic, which the variance expressed as a function of the covariates defined in .
6
    This unilateral term may follow the half-normal, truncated normal, exponential and gamma distribution.
7
    The truncation point of    is       , that is,
                                                                                                                6
     Battese and Coelli (1995) argue that is necessary to define the functional form of the stochastic
frontier. Several functional forms can be used in productive analyzes, such as the Translog and Cobb-
Douglas production functions. Translog frontier is more likely to be susceptible to multicolinearity even
if it is more flexible (Thiam et al., 2001). The last one presents constant returns to scale, unit elasticity of
substitution and its coefficients directly represent the output elasticity of inputs (Tegegne, Tadesse and
Zemedu (2014). As a result of its simplicity, the Cobb-Douglas functional form is estimated in this
research for irrigators and rain-fed farmers.
     Once the stochastic production frontier is estimated, the technical efficiency scores are obtained
following Battese and Coelli (1988) specification, which this efficiency measure is based on the
conditional expectation of , given the random error. The separation of the frontier deviations into their
random components and inefficiency can be defined as the ratio between the observed and the potential
output:



where the value of       will be in the range [0; 1], where zero represents complete inefficiency and 1, full
efficiency.


4. Empirical Application and Data Source
   As discussed before, we use Entropy Balancing Method to obtain the weights for the control groups.
Thus, we estimate the selection equation using a Probit as described in Equation (6):




    All those variables specified in Equation (10) are described later. We use a Cobb-Douglas production
function weighted by the vectors of weights obtained by Entropy Balancing and we included the Inverse
Mills Ratio (Mills). The Mills was obtained by the estimation of Equation (10). We also use some
controls to estimate the production function, as dummies for each Brazilian state; climatic variables and
its interactions with Brazilian macro-regions; and dummies related to farm size. Thus, the Cobb-Douglas
functional form following Battese and Coelli (1995) can be specified as:




where      represents the gross value of the production of farm i;         is a vector of inputs k used in
production, which are: land, labor, capital, and purchased inputs (expenses);       represents the climatic
variables;      represents the dummies for the five Brazilian regions;            represents dummies for
federative states; and     represents dummies for the four farm size considered. Such dummies were
included to capture fixed effects and to control spatial autocorrelation. The production function was
clustered by the Brazilian municipalities. The climatic variables are considered as non-market inputs, that

where schooling refers to the manager’s education level and it is divided into 7 categories (higher
education as base category); experience refers to manager’s experience into four categories (over 10 years
of experience as base category); rural.extension is a dummy variable that receives value 1 if the producer
accessed any type of technical assistance; financing is a dummy variable that receives value 1 if the
producer received any type of financing; and        is the random error term which it is assumed to be a half
normal distribution. In the case of rural extensions services and financing, the results imply a correlation
on technical efficiency scores due those services are a farmers’ decision and may be endogenous.
     The dataset used in the present research comes from the 2006 Agricultural Census microdata (farm
level), which only can be accessed in the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE)
headquarter in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The dataset contains information for more than 5 millions of
farmers.
     To adequate the dataset for this research, is necessary to perform some treatment in the dataset, such
as the exclusion of farms without area declaration (255,019 observations); farms settled in the urban area
(192,350 observations); and farms classified as special sectors - favelas, barracks, lodgings, boats,
indigenous villages, nursing homes, etc. (117,530 observations). We also excluded farms belonging to
rural settlements (139,496 observations) to avoid possible variables measurement errors.
     In addition, we only have included those farms owned by an individual producer, i.e., we excluded
those farmers which were considered condominium, consortium or partnership, cooperative, public
limited company or by quotas of limited liability, public utility institutions, government (Federal, state or
municipal) or other condition (190,838 observations). Likewise, farms which producer type is "not
identified" (20,440 observations) were excluded. After the exclusion and transformations, 915,673
observations were deleted (17.7% of the original sample), and the final sample is composed of 4,259,963
farms.
     The dataset were also organized into four classes according to the farm size (very small, small,
medium and large). The sizes were classified by IBGE according to the fiscal module classes8.
Furthermore, the database generation procedure was performed by the SAS® software, and the
methodological procedures were performed using the STATA® software.
     The treatment variable, that is, the indicative of the use of irrigation, is a dichotomous variable and
represents the answer to the following question: "Did you use irrigation in the farm?”. After the database
treatments, 6.22% of the farmers declared to have used irrigation technology in the farm.
     In addition to economic variables, we also use socioeconomics, institutions, agronomics and climatic
characteristics in both entropy balancing and selection equation. All these variables were provided by
2006 Agricultural Census, except those related to climate. Variables used in the sample selection
(Equation 10) are described as follow: The variable gender is a dummy variable equals 1 if the farm’s
manager is male and 0 otherwise; age is the manager’s age; schooling is a categorical variable related to
the farm manager’s education level: do not read and write, literate, incomplete elementary school,
complete elementary school, agricultural technician, high school and higher education (base); experience
is a categorical variable that represents the years in which the manager is in the farm header activity: up to
one year, between 1 and 5 years, between 5 and 10 years, over 10 years (base). We also included

  Fiscal module classification is defined as the minimum area required for rural properties to be considered economic viable,
ranging in area from 5 to 110 hectares. Based on the fiscal module, the farms can be classified into: very small (less than 1
fiscal module); small (between 1 and 4 fiscal module); medium (between 4 and 15 fiscal module); and large (more than 15
fiscal module). (Landau et al., 2012).

information on some resources as tv (television), phone, internet and energy, which are dummies
variables that receive value equal 1 if the farmer has the resource, and 0 otherwise.
     Other characteristics as farm ownership, whether the farmer lives in urban area or not, the presence of
skilled labor in the farm workforce and family farm classification may influence irrigation technology
adoption. We explore the farm ownership (farm.status) by including a categorical variable: Owner (base),
tenant, partner and occupant. Urban is a dummy set with value 1 if the farm’s manager lives in an urban
zone and zero otherwise; qualif is a dummy that capture the presence of skilled labor with value equal 1
and 0 otherwise; and ag.family is a dummy related to family farm classification9 which is equal 1 and 0
otherwise.
     We consider that the access to services and financing play an important role on the likelihood of
irrigation adoption. In this sense, we capture access to services by including dummies set with values
equal 1 if the farmer had received private extension services (priv.exten), governmental extension services
(gov.exten), and if they were co-ops membership (coops). Financ is a dummy that represents the access to
any type of financial resource (rural credit); vl.financ is the total amount supplied by the financial
institution and; vl.invest is the total amount invested in the farm.
     We added some variables to capture agronomic characteristic and natural resources endowment on the
likelihood of irrigation adoption: Ag.pract is a dummy equals 1 that indicates if the farmer uses any
agricultural practice10, and 0 otherwise; chem, fert and soilph are dummies that inform if the farmer used
chemicals, fertilizers and/or have corrected the soil pH, respectively. These dummies received values 1 in
an affirmative case, and zero otherwise. To capture natural resources endowment we set a dummy equal 1
if the farm has any water resource11 (water), and zero otherwise. Furthermore, we also included the
amount of total land degraded (deg.land) in hectares and the value of the land (vl.land) in R$ of 2006.
     Climatic variables are summer precipitation (summer.prec) and winter precipitation (winter.prec) in
millimeters; and summer temperature (summer.temp) and winter temperature (winter.temp) in Celsius
degree. These variables were averaged by municipality for 200612. We also have included the variance of
both temperature (var.temp) and precipitation (var.prec). Data was obtained from the Terrestrial
Hydrology Research Group (Civil and Environmental Engineering Department of Princeton
University)13.
     We use in the production function the gross value of production in 2006 (GVP) as a proxy to the
output (dependent variable). As inputs, we use land, labor, expenses and capital. Land is the sum of the
farm area designed to crops and pastures (in hectares), except irrigated land; Labor is the sum of both
family and hired labor; Expenses are the sum of purchased inputs (R$ of 2006) as energy, soil correctives,
fertilizers, agrochemicals, animal medicines, transportation, packages, seeds and seedlings, and feed/salt;
Capital is the sum of buildings, land and vehicles (R$ of 2006).

   To use climatic variables at the farm level, it would be necessary to obtain the longitude and latitude of the farm, which
violates the confidentiality of the dataset provided by IBGE. In this sense, the assumption adopted in this research is that the
climatic variables at the municipal level fit a good approximation for those that would be observed within the farm.

used in the selection equation. In general, farmers that use irrigation have higher levels of schooling,
reaching 4.5% on higher education when compared to rain-fed farmers, 2.5%.
     As can be observed in Table 1, irrigators have a higher share of electricity and the workforce with
skilled labor. Regarding the age, experience and farm ownership, there are no disparities on averages
between the groups.
     Although the large proportion of irrigators with water resources in the farm, around 87%, we also can
observe a large proportion of farmers that have water resources into the farm and do not use irrigation
technology (74.2%). This result may be related to the low proportion of rain-fed farmers that received
rural extension (mainly governmental extension) and accessed financial resources when compared to
irrigators (Table 2 – Appendix A). However, we should consider that irrigation is not needed when
farmers are facing some regularity in precipitation as observed in some regions of Brazil14.
     We also can observe in Table 2 (Appendix A) significant differences in the proportion of irrigators
that performed some agricultural practice (e.g. crop rotation) and irrigators that used agrochemicals,
fertilizers and soil pH correctives, which imply that these farmers had used irrigation technology with
some soil management seeking to ensure crops’ yield. Thus, the value of the land (asset) of the irrigators
is greater than rain-fed farmers due the technology embodiment (Schoengold and Ziberman, 2007) and
this result also can be observed in Table 2.
     The great difference between the groups can be observed in the gross value of production obtained in
2006 by the irrigators’ farmers, which is almost two times higher when compared to rain-fed producers.
This result shows the importance of irrigation in national agricultural production in terms of value
produced and, therefore, productivity gains from irrigation, which demonstrates the advantages of this
technology. The value of land, buildings and vehicles (proxy for capital), expenses in purchased inputs
and labor have a higher average for irrigators when compared to the rain-fed. On the other hand, there are
no significant differences in the amount of land employed in crops and pastures, which reinforce
productivity gains due to irrigation.

    The result of the Entropy Balancing, which is based on the mean of the covariates (first moment of the
sample), can be observed in the column "Balanced sample" in Table 1. Before the Entropy Balancing the
means of the variables between irrigators and rain-fed farmers were statistically different. After the
Entropy Balancing, we did not find any statistically significant difference between these groups. This
balance is confirmed by the non-significance of null hypothesis of the test of equality of means (Table 1).
It implies that, for each treatment group there is a similar control, differing only for irrigation adoption.

5.2. Production Elasticities
     We estimated the stochastic production frontier for the total sample and for both irrigators and rain-
fed farmers. The parameters of the Cobb-Douglas function were obtained by the Maximum Likelihood.
Therefore, the estimated coefficients represents itself the production elasticities15. Results are shown in
Table 4.
     Wald statistic indicates a good fit of the model, rejecting the null hypothesis of joint insignificance of
the variables for the three estimated models at 1%. The hypothesis of sample selection bias related to
irrigation adoption was statistically confirmed by the significance of the estimated coefficients for the
Inverse Mills Ratio for both irrigators and rain-fed farmers, which imply that there are unobservable
factors that influence the irrigation adoption decision.
     In summary, we found that water resources endowment in the farm are capable of increasing the
likelihood of irrigation adoption, since the decision to irrigate is straightforward related to the availability
of this resource in the farm. The use of agrochemicals, soil pH correction and soil fertilization contributed
positively to the probability of irrigation technology adoption. Nonetheless, these inputs were the ones
that most influenced the probability of adopting irrigation, including the electricity endowment.
     The estimated model for the Brazilian agriculture (pooled) indicates that purchased inputs and the
labor most contributed to the formation of the gross value of production (GVP) in 2006, indicating that an
increase in 10% in the amount used of these factors would lead to an increase, on average, of 3.72% and
3.55% in GVP, respectively. Similar results were found in Freitas (2017) and Rada et al. (2019). On the

other hand, land and capital were the factors that contributed less to the GVP, since an increase in 10% in
these inputs would lead to an increase, on average, in 2.06% and 0.6% in GVP, respectively.
    Regarding the production elasticities related to irrigators and rain-fed farmers, there were significant
differences in the contribution of each input to the GVP formation. For the irrigators, we observed the

contributed, on average, to GVP formation.

     On the other hand, labor and land are the factors that most contributed to an increase of GVP for rain-
fed farmers. This result can be explained in part by the lack of knowledge of the irrigation benefits and
productive techniques, or constrains in the credit market, which become the new technologies adoption
more difficult. Thus, the only alternative for these farmers increase their production is through increments
of productive land and workforce. However, Ullah and Perret (2014) points out that labor-intensive
farming system can be a source of employment for rural populations.
     The variance of the model was re-parameterized according to Battese and Coelli (1995), such that
                 and             . The value of λ is between zero and the unity. If λ is close to zero, it
implies that deviations from production frontier are entirely due to random noise, while a value around
the unity indicates that most of the deviations are due to inefficiency. Thus, for the pooled model, we can
inferred that 75.1% of the deviations to the efficient frontier come from technical inefficiency sources; for
irrigators, 71.3%, and for rain-fed farmers is 77.1%. This result may be a signal that irrigators are more
efficient than rain-fed farmers. This result also indicates that the Stochastic Production Frontier approach
is suitable, since λ were equal to zero, the production function could be estimated by Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS).
        Table 4 also shows the result for inefficiency equation. We modeled this equation which the error
term (inefficiency) variance is a function of a covariates vector. If a variable tends to decrease the
inefficiency variance, it implies that the observations are close to the efficiency average level. For all
models, we can infer that farmers’ schooling levels in the lower bound decrease the variance when
compared to farmers that have higher education (base). On the other hand, low levels of experience are
associated with an increase in the inefficiency variance when compared to those who have more than 10
years of farm’s management. This result implies that higher education is not enough to increase
efficiency, but it can be observed once farmer has high level of experience. Tiruneh et al. (2017) found
that experience through age matters in production.
     Genius et al. (2014) suggest that the high levels of experience linked to a technology transmission
channel, such as technical assistance services and social network, may be more important in new
technologies adoption in irrigation than education levels. Although this study did not consider technical
efficiency, they argued that technical assistance and social learning through experience could help them in
this task. In addition, Speelman et al. (2008) found that education did not significantly affect technical
efficiency, while Watto and Mugera (2019) argued that in relation to education effects on technical
efficiency, researchers should consider the relevance of a farmer’s education to his farming business.
     We also found that any type of access to technical assistance and financing (credit) influences farmers
to reach the efficiency average level since this factors decrease inefficiency variance. The findings of
Karagiannis et al. (2003), Haji (2007), Freitas (2017) and Watto and Mugera (2019) also confirm the
positive effect of financial resources and extension services in improving farmer’s technical efficiency.
     Notwithstanding, our result can be evaluated through descriptive statistics in Table 1, which only
2.5% of rain-fed and 4.5% of irrigators has higher education level, while 67.6% (rain-fed) and 60.9%
(irrigators) do not read and write or did not complete elementary school. On the other hand, 63.8% (rain-
fed) and 65.3% (irrigators) have more than 10 years of experience in farm management. Moreover, Table

2 (Appendix A) shows that 12.3% and 8.4% of rain-fed farmers had access to private and governmental
technical assistance, respectively. Better result can be observed to irrigators, where 18.5% and 17% of
them had access to private and public assistance respectively, which corroborate with Foster and
Rosenzweig (1995; 2010) and Genius et al. (2014) on the role of social learning, learning-by-doing and
extension services (mainly governmental assistance) in irrigation technology adoption and efficiency
improvements.


5.3. Technical Efficiency Scores
    The unbiased technical efficiency scores (TE) were obtained for all models estimated and classified
by farm size. Table 6 shows the result. We found that average technical efficiency of the irrigators was
29.68%, whereas for those who are rain-fed were 24.38%, which imply that irrigators are technically
more efficient than rain-fed at 5.3 percentage points. These results imply that irrigation technology
adoption is capable to move farms to the best practice, that is, the potential production. However, there is
a lot of room for both irrigators and rain-fed farmers to increase production maintaining the same amount
of inputs.

Note: Standard deviations in ( ); Number of observations in [ ]

    The values of the standard deviations for both irrigators and rain-fed (0.1701 and 0.1831,
respectively) suggest that, in relation to the mean, there is a great dispersion of the data, i.e., there is a
great heterogeneity in terms of technical efficiency, which leads to a low average of TE. To confirm this
result, TE distributions are shown in Figure 3 - Appendix A for both groups. We also observed a great
number of farmers that had non-positive value of production, but they had used some amount of inputs,
which may be explained in part for losses in production due to climate anomaly or diseases involved in
the production process, which decrease TE scores. Estimates of technical efficiency scores for those
farmers only with positive production make the TE scores double.
    We found for all models estimated that technical efficiency (TE) scores by farm size, on average,
increase from the very small to small farmers. Then, we observed that average TE scores decrease as the
farm size increases. Therefore, we conclude that small farmers are the most technically efficient, which
imply they are those that transform productive factors into gross production value more efficiently and
corroborates with Schutz (1965), who argued that small farmers are poor but efficient.
    A test of equality of means (t-test) between both groups irrigators and rain-fed farmers and within
each group taking into account the farm size was performed to verify if the technical efficiency mean
scores were different from each other or were statistically the same. Table 7 shows the result, which
indicated that all the means of technical efficiency between and within the groups were statistically
different, except for the very small and medium rain-fed farmers. Between irrigators and rain-fed, the
difference is -0.0530 and t-test is equal to -1.4e+02, which imply the rejection of the null hypothesis of
equality of means.

    We display the behavior of technical efficiency and farm size in Figure 1. The greatest difference in
terms of average TE between both irrigators and rain-fed was for large farmers, which irrigators in this
size are 6.48 p.p. more efficient than non-adopters, which imply that, although small farmers are, on
average, more efficient than the others, the irrigation technology adoption has a stronger effect on TE for
the large farmers. The smallest difference in TE due to irrigation adoption was found for the very small
farms, around 4.9 p.p.. Helfand and Levine (2004) pointed out that large farms can have preferential
access to institutions and services that help reduce inefficiency such as rural electricity, technical
assistance, and market access; and more intensive use of technologies and inputs that increase
productivity, for instance, irrigation technology.

6. Conclusions
    Irrigated agriculture in Brazil is an effective tool to alleviate poverty and improve income distribution,
generating employment at lower costs than those in other sectors of the economy, which increase food
supply at lower prices than those produced in non-irrigated areas and significant increase in productivity
of land and labor factors.
    In this sense, the present research aimed to identify the effect of irrigation technology adoption on the
productive performance of farmers, in terms of technical efficiency. The analysis also extended to
different farm sizes. Dataset at farm level of 2006 Agricultural Census were accessed in the Restricted
Access Room (SAR) of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE.
    Regarding the technical efficiency, both irrigators and rain-fed had a low level of technical efficiency,
where irrigators are more efficient than rain-fed farmers in 5.3 percentage points, on average. The
analysis by farm size showed that, in both groups, the small farmers are more efficient than the others.
However, the greatest difference observed in efficiency scores between irrigators and non-adopters was
for large farms, which imply that irrigation technology has a significant effect on the efficiency gain for
this group.
    The outline of public policies to encourage irrigation adoption can be led, initially, to the effective
provision of rural extension services and the increase in skilled workforce in the farm, and projects that
promote rural electrification and the existence of water resources, since these factors contributed to the
increase of irrigation technology adoption. Nevertheless, electricity and water resources are, in general,
prerequisites for the implementation of irrigation systems. The role of public policies also relies on rural
technical assistance provision and credit market access due the importance of these factors to increasing
efficiency.
    Irrigation revealed itself capable of making farmers more efficient, which shows the effectiveness of
the technology. However, greater investments in public policy on irrigated agriculture are suggested with
special attention to very small producers, 77% of the total, which irrigation adoption had less impact in
technical efficiency, which is related to farmers’ managerial skills. To achieve improvements in rural
development, better management of governmental credit and investment programs are also essential in
those tasks.
