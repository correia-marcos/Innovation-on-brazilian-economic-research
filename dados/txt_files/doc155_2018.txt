ABSTRACT: We develop a multiregional general equilibrium model for Greece to simulate the short
run impacts of temporary deficit-financed rises in government spending. It has been recognized that
the fiscal multiplier is a function of structural features of the economy and policy reaction parameters.
Moreover, the debate on the magnitude of the multiplier along the business cycle has also been the
subject of disputed debates. On these grounds, we look at the Greek case by calibrating the model
using data for distinct states of the Greek economy during the development of the recent crisis.
Whether this matters for local and nationwide multipliers depends on qualitative differences of the
numerical structures of the model. Our results imply that structural coefficients have a strong effect
on government spending impact multipliers. In the case of Greece, lack of information on the
changing magnitudes of behavioral parameters over time adds another layer of uncertainty to this
debate.

RESUMO: Este artigo tem como objetivo desenvolver um modelo multirregional de equilíbrio geral
para a Grécia para simular os impactos de curto prazo dos aumentos temporários dos gastos do
governo. O multiplicador fiscal é reconhecido como função das características estruturais da
economia e dos parâmetros de reação política. Além disso, o debate sobre a magnitude do
multiplicador também tem sido objeto de debate. Portanto, este trabalho analisa o caso grego ao
calibrar o modelo multirregional de equilíbrio geral usando dados regionais da economia grega
durante a recente crise. Se isso importa para os multiplicadores locais e nacionais depende de
diferenças qualitativas das estruturas numéricas do modelo. Os resultados mostram que os
coeficientes estruturais têm forte efeito sobre os multiplicadores de impacto dos gastos do governo.
No caso da Grécia, a falta de informação sobre a mudança das magnitudes dos parâmetros
comportamentais ao longo do tempo acrescenta outra camada de incerteza a esse debate.

1. Introduction
         The global financial crisis and ensuing recession triggered major fiscal packages throughout the
world. Many countries implemented fiscal expansion measures in order to stimulate their economies with
the hope of boosting demand and limiting job losses. In this context, the debate regarding the impact of
fiscal policy on economic activity regained momentum. Despite the existence of many academic studies
about the impacts of government spending, the effectiveness of fiscal packages remains a disputed issue.
In fact, among such various studies, there is consensus on neither the sign nor the size of government
multipliers (Parker, 2011; Ramey, 2011; Taylor, 2011).
         The magnitude of the multiplier may vary for different reasons, including alternative theoretical
approaches, methods of calculations and data sources (Chinn, 2013). Contrasting results in the theoretical
literature stems mainly from different analytical structures4 embedded in Neoclassical and New
Keynesian classes of models (Ramey, 2011; Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014). The usual empirical
approaches to calculate multipliers – Vector Auto-Regressions (VAR) and Dynamic Stochastic General
Equilibrium Models (DSGE) –, together with a plethora of reduced-form econometric estimation, rely on
different functional structures, bringing additional uncertainty to their magnitude (Parker, 2011).
Moreover, identifying strategies under limited availability of reliable instruments may cast doubts in
econometric studies on the required exogeneity assumption on changes in government fiscal policy
(Romer and Romer, 2010; Barro and Redlick, 2011).
         In addition to distinct analytical and functional structures underlying different theoretical and
empirical approaches, the numerical structure embedded in empirical studies is another source of
uncertainty for the magnitude of the fiscal multiplier. As Chinn (2013) observes, the multiplier is a
function of structural features of the economy and policy reaction parameters. The information contained
in the data also reflects the economic context, which is an important element to define the magnitude of
fiscal multipliers (Ilzetzki et al., 2013; Arin et al., 2015; Hory, 2016).
         Thus, based upon strictly methodological grounds, it is understandable that, even by adopting the
same theoretical model, the evidence extracted from different methods of calculations may be quite
different. Even keeping the same theoretical model and method of investigation, it is also possible that
different speciﬁcations of the method adopted are able to produce different outcomes (Almeida et al.,
2010). In an extreme case, holding both the analytical and the functional structures constant, numerical
structures based on different states of the economy may also lead to different results. Hence, interpretation
of the relationship between government spending and changes in output is unlikely to be independent of
the choice of the database (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012; Charles, 2016; Haddad et al., 2017).
         A renewed stream of literature relates to the calculation of local fiscal multipliers (Moretti, 2010;
Acconcia et al., 2014; Chodorow-Reich, 2017). Local multipliers, or geographic cross-sectional fiscal
spending multipliers, usually relates the change in regional output to a change in government spending in
the region.5 Compared to the debate on nationwide multipliers, there is a caveat in the definition of local
multipliers that prevents reconciliation between them. In an integrated interregional system within a
country’s territory, the focus on intraregional effects excludes interregional spillovers of government
spending from the calculation. Given the more open nature of subnational regions, there are potentially
relevant leakages in the spending from a jurisdiction recipient of resources from the central government.
Thus, as observed by Fishback and Kachanovskaya (2015), reduced-form econometric estimation of local
multipliers cannot be easily translated into a national multiplier because of spillover effects outside each
region’s boundaries not captured in those models. Nonetheless, as we will show later on, this limitation
does not exist in bottom-up multiregional structural models, at least in the short run.
         In this paper, we explore the role of numerical structures in the context of local multipliers derived
from a multiregional multisectoral structural general equilibrium framework. Given the complexity and

  “An empirical economic model (…) embodies three types of information: analytical, functional and numerical. The
analytical structure is the background theoretical material which identifies the variables of interest and posits their causal
relations. The functional structure is the mathematical representation of the analytical material, and consists of the
algebraic equations which make up the actual model. The numerical structure consists of the signs and magnitudes of the
coefficients in the equations which form the functional structure.” (McKitrick, 1998, p. 545)

  Hereafter, we narrow down the definition of local multipliers by excluding other fiscal policy instruments.

amount of feedback involved in this kind of investigation for which data constraints preclude econometric
estimation, we rely on the calibration method. The choice of such approach is grounded on its capacity
for examining policy shocks across regions in the midst of all complexity and feedback effects involved.
Adopting this perspective, the model, the method of investigation, and its speciﬁcation are chosen and
will be kept constant, following a strategy suggested in Almeida et al. (2010). We can thus focus on the
role of the numerical structure by calibrating the model with different datasets for Greece. Moreover, we
show that the multiregional approach can circumvent the lack of a desirable reconciliation between local
and nationwide multipliers.
         The Greek case is particularly interesting to be examined. From 2010 to 2013, period of our
analysis, real GDP fell almost 23% in Greece, with a decrease in government expenditures by 25% and
in investments by roughly 45%, with a small increase in international exports by less than 2%. In the same
period, real GRP from the 13 NUTS-2 regions varied from -14.7%, in Western Macedonia to -31.9% in
Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. In the case of Greece, geography has played an important role since the
spatial pattern of the initial impacts of the austerity measures was influenced by the geographical presence
of the public sector. However, when taking into account indirect and induced effects, the regional structure
of the Greek economy has also influenced the spatial propagation of the impacts through a complex
diffusion of the multiplier effects (Haddad et al., 2017). Though small, the Greek economy is not internally
homogenous, presenting variations across both industries and regions. Thus, the anti-crisis, austerity,
measures taken in Greece, though horizontal in their nature, may have signiﬁcantly differentiated
implications across space (Psycharis et al., 2014).
         The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we narrow down the issues
addressed in the analysis, defining the empirical strategy. Section 3 presents the model used in the
simulations, whose results we present and discuss in Section 4. A final section concludes.
2. Modeling Issues and Empirical Strategy
         Addressing the abovementioned issues as the main contributions of this paper – role of numerical
structure and reconciliation of local and nationwide multipliers – would require an applied modelling
approach that took into consideration the structure of interregional linkages within a country driven by
trade relations (commodity flows), and factor mobility. Information on structural features of distinct states
of such integrated interregional national system should also be available for calibration of different
versions of the model.
         Our choice of the modelling approach highlights the specification of an interdependent system of
regions within a country in which national-regional feedbacks may occur in both directions. In this so-
called bottom-up approach, analysis of policies originating at the regional level is also possible. The
adding-up property is fully recognized, since national results are obtained from the aggregation of regional
results (Giesecke and Madden, 2013).
         We depart from a static multiregional and multisectoral general equilibrium model, whose
specification we describe in details in Section 3. Despite some caveats, discussed below, the framework
embeds some of the distinct features raised in the literature as deemed important for understanding
regional adjustment mechanisms to government spending shocks. It includes some of the quantifiable
forces that make local multipliers differ from national multipliers, namely expenditure switching due to
domestic terms of trade effects; income effects affecting consumption of both locally-produced and
external goods; and labor mobility (Chodorow-Reich, 2017).
         Another reason for differences between local and national multipliers is the absence of the
possibility of a reaction, at the regional level, by monetary policy. Nonetheless, given the neoclassical
nature of our model, with flexible relative prices, money is neutral, implying that the specification of
monetary policy is irrelevant (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014). In this case, assumptions on the sources
and period of financing, as well as the persistence of government stimuli, gain greater relevance.
         Our results will focus on the short run impacts of a temporary deficit-financed increase in
government spending in the fitted-model Greek economy. We will compute the impact multiplier as the
change in output that results when government spending is increased by 1 percent of GDP. Due to the
static nature of the modelling framework adopted in this paper, we switch off some of the usual

                                                                                                           3
mechanisms that are present in dynamic settings. First, it is important to distinguish between impact
multipliers and the cumulative multiplier (Chinn, 2013). In our context, we provide a first-order
approximation of the impact multiplier of government spending on goods and services. Since there is no
dynamics in the model, the simulations will capture the effects associated with what-if questions in a
comparative-static framework. Considerations on short run and long run differ in the way the equilibrating
mechanisms are set through the closures of the model, discussed in Section 3.
         The definition of the closure also deals with identification issues. Although some critics may
argue for the charge of incredible identifying assumptions (Sims, 1980), structural models with explicit
behavioral assumptions for the relevant agents do not face identification problems commonly found in
econometric models. Thus, our exogeneity assumption on government spending shocks will be
structurally explicit.
         Second, we exempt our analysis from any intertemporal considerations in agents’ behavior. The
implications for the discussion on fiscal multipliers are at least twofold. On one hand, we can have a
narrative approach to justify the short run financing of additional transitory government demand shocks
by deficit increases. Moreover, if agents ignore the intertemporal aspect of their spending problem, then
outside-financed and locally deficit-financed multipliers may coincide, as suggested in Chodorow-Reich
(2017). On the other hand, we do not need to worry about long run reversal of short run changes in relative
prices in the context of transitory demand shocks in single-currency interregional systems.
         Finally, we will calibrate the model using two different datasets. Our strategy is to use the same
set of behavioral parameters for both models, and use data from interregional input-output systems for
two years, 2010 and 2013, to calibrate the structural coefficients. The choice of the years is based on both
data availability and, mainly, the ability to represent distinct states of the Greek economy during the
development of the crisis. As we can see in Figure 1, we have selected two snapshots of the Greek
economy related to two points in time that reveal structural features just before the recession took off and
in its peak, when the unemployment rate reached its highest point.

3. Specification of the Model
         In this section, we present the analytical, functional and numerical structures of the multiregional
general equilibrium model for Greece. The specification of the linearized form of the model is provided,
based on different groups of equations. The notational convention uses uppercase letters to represent the
levels of the variables and lowercase for their percentage-change representation. Superscripts (u), u = 0,
1j, 2j, 3, 4, 5, refer, respectively, to output (0) and to the five different regional-specific users of the
products identified in the model6: producers in sector j (1j), investors in sector j (2j), households (3),
purchasers of exports (4), and government (5); the second superscript (r) identifies the domestic region
where the user is located. Inputs are identified by two subscripts: the first (i) takes the values 1, ..., g, for
commodities, g + 1, for primary factors; the second subscript identifies the source of the input, being it

  We have specified a sixth residual user, (6), to deal with statistical discrepancies in the balancing of the model’s
absorption matrix based on the Greek interregional input-output system (IIOS). This procedure deals with the information
provided in the IIOS on re-exports, and direct purchases abroad by residents and purchases on the domestic territory by
non-residents, not explicitly introduced in the specification of the CGE model.

from domestic region b (1b) or imported (2), or coming from labor (1) or capital (2), the two primary
factors in the model. The symbol (•) is employed to indicate a sum over an index.
         We define the following sets: 𝐺 = {1, … , 𝑔}, where g is the number of composite goods; 𝐺 ∗ =
{1, … , 𝑔, 𝑔 + 1}, where g+1 is the number of composite goods and primary factors, with 𝐺 ∗ ⊃ 𝐺; 𝐻 =
{1, … , ℎ}, where h is the number of industries; 𝑈 = {(3), (4𝑏), (5), (𝑘𝑗)} for 𝑘 = (1), (2) and 𝑗 ∈ 𝐻, is
the set of all users in the model; 𝑈 ∗ = {(3), (5), (𝑘𝑗)} for 𝑘 = (1), (2) and 𝑗 ∈ 𝐻, with 𝑈 ⊃ 𝑈 ∗ , is the
subset of domestic users; 𝑆 = {1, … , 𝑟, 𝑟 + 1}, where r+1 is the number of all regions (including foreign);
𝑆 ∗ = {1, … , 𝑟}, with 𝑆 ⊃ 𝑆 ∗ , is the subset with the r domestic regions; and 𝐹 = {1, … , 𝑓} is the set of
primary factors. In the ICGE model for Greece, g = h = 44, and r = 13, f = 2.
         We model the sourcing of composite goods based on multilevel structures, which enable a great
number of substitution possibilities. We employ nested sourcing functions for the creation of composite
goods, available for consumption in the regions of the model. We assume that domestic users, i.e. firms,
investors, households, and government, use combinations of composite goods specified within two-level
CES nests. At the bottom level, bundles of domestically produced goods are formed as combinations of
goods from different regional sources. At the top level, substitution is possible between domestically
produced and imported goods. Equations (1) and (2) describe, respectively, the regional sourcing of
domestic goods, and the substitution between domestic and imported products.

        In addition to goods used as intermediate inputs, firms in the model also demand primary factors
of production. The equations that describe the industry j’s demands inputs are derived under the
assumption of Leontief technology with Armington nests (imperfect substitution between inputs of the
same type from different sources). In our specification of the nested production functions, we assume
firms to use combinations of composite intermediate inputs, formed according to Equations (1) and (2),
and primary factor composites. In the case of the primary factor bundle, substitution is possible among
different types of primary factors. Equation (3) specifies the substitution between labor and capital in the
model, and is derived under the assumption that industries choose their primary factor inputs to minimize
costs subject to obtaining sufficient primary factor inputs to satisfy their technical requirements (nested
Leontief/CES specification). We have included technical change variables to allow for factor-specific
productivity shocks. We model the combination of intermediate inputs and the value added (primary
factors) aggregate in fixed proportions, at the very top of the nested production function, assuming there
is no substitution between primary factors and other inputs. The Leontief specification is presented in
Equation (4). More flexible functional forms have been rarely introduced in multi-regional models,

the sectoral demand for the primary factor composite and the total output, we have also included a scale
parameter. This modeling procedure has been based on previous work made by Haddad and Hewings
(2005) which allows for the introduction of Marshallian agglomeration (external) economies, by
exploring local properties of the CES function.

         In deriving the household demands for composite commodities, we assume that households in
each region behave as a single, budget-constrained, utility-maximizing entity. The utility function is of
the Stone-Geary or Klein-Rubin form. Equation (6) determines the optimal composition of household
demand in each region. Total regional household consumption is determined as a function of real
household income. The demands for the commodity bundles in the nesting structure of household demand
follow the CES pattern established in Equations (1) and (2), in which an activity variable and a price-
substitution term play the major roles. In Equation (6), consumption of each commodity i depends on two
components: first, for the subsistence component, which is defined as the minimum expenditure
requirement for each commodity, changes in demand are generated by changes in the number of
households and tastes; second, for the luxury or supernumerary part of the expenditures in each good,
demand moves with changes in the regional supernumerary expenditures, changes in tastes, and changes
in the price of the composite commodity. The two components of household expenditures on the
composite commodities are weighted by their respective shares in the total consumption of the composite
commodity.

        Together with Equation (12), Equations (13) and (14) constitute the model’s pricing system. The
price received for any activity is equal to the costs per unit of output. As can be noticed, the assumption
of constant returns to scale adopted here precludes any activity variable from influencing basic prices, i.e.,
unit costs are independent of the scale at which activities are conducted. Thus, Equation (13) defines the
percentage change in the price received by producers in regional industry j per unit of output as being
equal to the percentage change in j’s costs, which are affected by changes in technology and changes in
input prices.

        Regional population is defined through the interaction of demographic variables, including
interregional migration. Links between regional population and regional labor supply are provided.

Demographic variables are usually defined exogenously, and together with the specification of some of
the labor market settings, labor supply can be determined together with either interregional wage
differentials or regional unemployment rates. In summary, either labor supply and wage differentials
determine unemployment rates, or labor supply and unemployment rates determine wage differentials.
        Equation (21) defines the percentage-point change in regional unemployment rates in terms of
percentage changes in labor supply and persons employed.
                                                                               (•)𝑟

where 𝑑𝑒𝑙_𝑢𝑛𝑟 (𝑟) measures percentage-point changes in regional unemployment rate; 𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑢𝑝(𝑟) is the
variable for regional labor supply; and the coefficients 𝐿𝐴𝐵𝑆𝑈𝑃(𝑟) and 𝐸𝑀𝑃𝐿𝑂𝑌(𝑟) are the benchmark
values for regional labor supply and regional employment, respectively. The variable 𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑢𝑝(𝑟) moves
with regional workforce participation rate, proportional to the regional population, and population of
working age. Equation (22) defines regional population changes in the model as ordinary changes in flows
of net regional migration (𝑑_𝑟𝑚(𝑟) ), net foreign migration (𝑑_𝑓𝑚(𝑟) ), and natural population growth
(𝑑_𝑔(𝑟) ).

𝑃𝑂𝑃(𝑟)𝑝𝑜𝑝(𝑟) = 𝑑_𝑟𝑚(𝑟) + 𝑑_𝑓𝑚(𝑟) + 𝑑_𝑔(𝑟)                                             𝑟 ∈ 𝑆∗                                          (22)
where 𝑃𝑂𝑃(𝑟) is a coefficient measuring regional population in the benchmark year.
        Equation (23) shows movements in per-household utility differentials, 𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙_𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 (𝑟) , defined as
the difference between the movement in regional utility, and the national overall utility (𝑎𝑔𝑔_𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙),
including a shift variable, 𝑓𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙 (𝑟) .

𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙_𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 (𝑟) = 𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝑟) − 𝑎𝑔𝑔_𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙 + 𝑓𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙 (𝑟)                                    𝑟 ∈ 𝑆∗                                          (23)
       Finally, we can define changes in regional output as weighted averages of changes in regional
aggregates, according to Equation (24) below:

                                       (𝐷𝐸𝑋𝑃𝑟 𝑥(•(1𝑟)) − 𝐷𝐼𝑀𝑃𝑟 𝑥(•(1s)) )                𝑟 ∈ 𝑆 ∗ ; 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 ∗ for 𝑠 ≠ 𝑟                  (24)

where 𝑔𝑟𝑝𝑟 is the percentage change in real Gross Regional Product in region r; and the
coefficients 𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟 𝐼𝑁𝑉 𝑟 , 𝐺𝑂𝑉 𝑟 , 𝐹𝐸𝑋𝑃𝑟 , 𝐹𝐼𝑀𝑃𝑟 , 𝐷𝐸𝑋𝑃𝑟 and 𝐷𝐼𝑀𝑃𝑟 represent, respectively, the
following regional aggregates: investments, government spending, foreign exports, foreign imports,
domestic exports and domestic imports. National output, 𝐺𝐷𝑃, is, thus, the sum of 𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟 across all regions
r. Notice that regional domestic trade balances cancel out.
        To close the model, we set the following variables exogenously, which are usually exogenous
                                               (1𝑗)𝑟    (1𝑗)𝑟  (2𝑗)𝑟   (3)𝑟    (4)𝑟     (4)𝑟     (5)𝑟

𝑓𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙 (𝑟) . To complete the short run environment, used in our forthcoming exercises, we also set
                                        (1𝑗)𝑟
unchanged current stocks of capital (𝑥(𝑔+1,2) ), the national real wage (𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑤𝑎𝑔𝑒), regional wage
differentials, (𝑤𝑎𝑔𝑒_𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 (𝑟) ), and regional population, by keeping regional migration unchanged
(𝑑_𝑟𝑚(𝑟) ).7
        There are other definitions of variables computed by using outcomes from simulations based on
the system of Equations (1)-(23). Of special interest to our discussion is the definition of regional/national
GDP and its components, whose results will be reported later on.

    In a long run closure, the assumptions on interregional mobility of capital and labor are relaxed by swapping variables

Calibration
        The calibration of the model requires two subsets of data to define its numerical structure so that
we implement the model empirically. First, we need information from an absorption matrix derived from
interregional input-output sources (Table 1) to calculate the coefficients of the model based on the
following input-output flows:
    •   𝐵(𝑖, 1𝑏, (𝑢), 𝑟), with 𝑖 ∈ 𝐺 ∗ , (𝑢) ∈ 𝑈, 𝑏, 𝑟 ∈ 𝑆 ∗
    •   𝑇(𝑖, 𝑠, (𝑢), 𝑟), with 𝑖 ∈ 𝐺 ∗ , 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆, 𝐹, (𝑢) ∈ 𝑈, 𝑟 ∈ 𝑆 ∗
    •   𝑉(𝑖, 𝑠, (𝑢), 𝑟), with 𝑖 ∈ 𝐺 ∗ , 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆, 𝐹, (𝑢) ∈ 𝑈, 𝑟 ∈ 𝑆 ∗
    •   𝑌(𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑟), with 𝑖 ∈ 𝐺 ∗ , 𝑗 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑟 ∈ 𝑆 ∗

        We complete this information with supplementary demographic data from EUROSTAT to
calibrate the coefficients 𝐿𝐴𝐵𝑆𝑈𝑃(𝑟), 𝐸𝑀𝑃𝐿𝑂𝑌(𝑟) and 𝑃𝑂𝑃(𝑟), with 𝑟 ∈ 𝑆 ∗ . Because these estimates
are based on snapshot observations for a single year revealing the economic structure of the economic
system, this subset of data is denoted “structural coefficients” (Haddad et al., 2002).

        The second piece of information necessary to calibrate the model is represented by the subset of
data defining various parameters, mainly elasticities. These are called “behavioral parameters”. Empirical

4. Discussion of Results
       Let us first define local and nationwide multipliers in the context of our model specification. We
compute output (value added) multipliers based on an overall increase in government spending equivalent
to 1 percent of GDP. We impose regional-specific changes in 𝑓 (5)𝑟 , the shift term for government
expenditures in region r, that are proportional to GRP in each region, such that:
∆𝐺𝑂𝑉 𝑟 = (0.01)𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟                      𝑟 ∈ 𝑆∗                                                           (25)
where ∆𝐺𝑂𝑉 𝑟 is the ordinary change in government spending in region r, used to compute values for
𝑓 (5)𝑟 .
         We focus our analysis on the impacts of government spending on changes in output. The
simulations provide outcomes for percentage changes in 𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟 and 𝐺𝐷𝑃, so that we can compute the
associated ordinary changes, ∆𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟 and ∆𝐺𝐷𝑃, as follows:
∆𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟 = 𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟 𝑔𝑟𝑝𝑟 and ∆𝐺𝐷𝑃 = ∑𝑟 ∆𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑟                         𝑟 ∈ 𝑆∗                                      (26)
        Since the typical simulation involves several different regional shocks, we can divide the total
change in any endogenous variable between the various shocks. We can thus decompose the changes in
output according to the contribution of each regional government demand shock. We add a subscript to
ordinary changes in GRP in each region to include information on the different origins of the exogenous
change in government spending that may affect that regional output. Equation (27) makes it explicit that
there are spillovers from local government spending to other regions in the system.

        The definition of 𝐾(s) only takes into account intra-regional effects of local spending.
Nonetheless, there are potential effects on other regions’ output, so that we can compute the nationwide

𝐾(s) =                    𝑟, 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 ∗                                                                     (29)

        Table 2 presents the results for the nationwide multiplier, based in information for two different
benchmark years, 2010 and 2013. In addition to the multipliers computed under our general equilibrium
specification, we have also computed, for the sake of comparison, value added multipliers using the input-
output model with endogenous households calibrated with the same databases. The input-output
framework provides our multiregional and multisectoral system with a demand-driven mechanical
approach to calculate multipliers based on an intricate plot of different average propensities to consume
and to import, with rigid relative prices and no supply constraints.
        Moving beyond mechanically rule-of-thumb agents seems to influence the magnitude of the
multipliers. The accounting-based input-output multipliers are one order of magnitude higher than their
general equilibrium counterparts. Given the closure of the general equilibrium model, which defines the
adjustment mechanisms of the economy to the exogenous shock, the imposition of supply constraints play
an important role to explain such differences.
        Considering the changes in mechanical propensities to consume and to import embedded in the
complex systems of interregional relations in the two benchmarks, the results reveal that the national
multiplier for Greece would have increased by 9.6% from 2010 to 2013. However, the general equilibrium
multiplier is slightly lower in 2013 than in 2010.

        Structural features of different states of an economy during the business cycle are often neglected
in the debate on the impact multipliers of government spending, specially their influence on the supply
responsiveness of the system. According to our model, in the short run closure, with fixed capital stocks,
the supply elasticity can be approximated by the expression in Equation (32), reflecting its close
connection with the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, the shares of labor and capital in
primary factor costs, and the share of primary factors in total costs. In other words, for given values of the
substitution elasticity, supply is more elastic as either the labor/capital ratio is higher, or the share of
materials in total cost is higher (Dixon et al., 1982).

         In Greece, changes in factor income were the main factors that help explaining the reduction in
the supply side elasticity and, consequently, the output multiplier during the recession. The share of
primary factors in total costs decreased from 0.566, in 2010, to 0.546, in 2013. In the same period, the
ratio of labor payments to capital payments fell from 0.693 to 0.597. Such structural changes reflect the
policy choices that led to recession. The rapid deterioration of wages and profit rates in the first years of
the Greek crisis led to lower intensity in value added generation in the economy, with a heavier burden
on workers.
         Taking into account price effects is also important to distinguish between nominal and real effects.
With lower sort-run supply elasticity, prices would have responded more sharply to the demand shocks
in 2013, reducing the relative real output impact of government spending. While nominal GDP rose by
3.18% in the 2010 simulation, and to 3.42% in the 2013, GDP deflator would have increased, respectively,
2.84% and 3.10%, leading to a smaller real output multiplier in the more recent year.

        We recall that we kept the same behavioral parameters of the model in the two simulations.
                                                                                              (1𝑗)𝑟
However, one important component of Equation (32) is the substitution elasticity, 𝜎3(𝑔+1) , set to 0.5 in
both benchmark years. Another caveat relates to the treatment of idle resources in the model. If, on one
side, we do take into account the level of unemployment in the workforce, on the other side we do not
consider differences in the utilization of the capacity of existing capital stocks. It is clear from Figure 2
that the drop in capacity utilization from 2010 to 2013 may suggest a relatively less costly adjustment to
capital use in the latter year. Having nothing to say in order to explicitly address this issue in our modeling
framework, we can play with the model’s parameters to mimic a more flexible supply-side adjustment
with the existing levels of capital stocks and different levels of capacity utilization in the economy. To
circumvent this methodological limitation, we carry out sensitivity analysis exercises with the value of
                                                                    (1𝑗)𝑟
the elasticity of substitution parameter. Higher values for 𝜎3(𝑔+1) , in given structural settings, would
potentially lead to higher labor absorption in the short run, i.e. with fixed capital stocks, pushing the supply
overall responsiveness of the economic system.
        Table 3 presents the results for different values of the primary factor elasticity of substitution. In
addition to the benchmark value (0.5), we also run the two models using alternative higher values (1.0
and 2.0), mimicking progressive lower rates of capacity utilization in the “two Greek economies”. It is
noteworthy that higher parameter values relates to higher multipliers in each structural setting. Due to the
lack of empirical evidence, we can only make conjectures about the likely differences of the values of the
parameter in the two points in time. In light of Figure 2, it would be reasonable to assume that its value in
2013 would be higher than that in 2010, given the fairly lower rate of capacity utilization in 2013.
Accepting that means that, given the simulated outcomes in Table 2, there would be a threshold difference
in the magnitude of both years’ parameters that would reverse the conclusion on the magnitude of the
multiplier in the different states of the Greek economy. In other words, we cannot conclude, under this
level of numerical uncertainty in our modeling framework, whether the multiplier is smaller in the
recession.

effects of government spending. In our neoclassical general equilibrium model, both local income effects
and interregional substitution effects can influence the adjustment of the system to government spending
demand shocks in the local economies. From the supply side, regional structural characteristics from
Equation (32) play different roles. We calculated, for each of the 13 Greek NUTS-2 regions, the labor to
capital ratio and the aggregate share of primary factors in total costs. On one hand, we found, for both
years, strong positive correlation between the latter and the nationwide, source-specific shock, multipliers,

On the other hand, the correlation between the regional ratio of labor payments to capital payments and
the local multipliers was meaningful in both years and more relevant in 2013 (25.7% in 2010, and 46.2%
in 2013). This first set of results suggest that, in our context, national output is more influenced by the
overall value added content in regional production systems, while local effects depend more heavily on
the ability of regional suppliers to respond promptly to the local demand shocks.

        Government spending is heavily concentrated in the purchase of local goods.8 One of its
consequences is to put pressure on prices of local goods to increase relative to prices of goods produced
elsewhere, generating a domestic terms of trade effect that switches expenditures away from local goods.
In the case of the potential impacts of government spending in a specific region, we expect to see a
reduction in regional exports in interregional trade and an increase in imports from other parts of the
country.9 Another consequence is the rise of local agents’ income that increase their expenditure not only
on locally produced but also on external goods, irrespective of changes in relative prices (Chodorow-
Reich, 2017).
        Finally, given the supply-constrained short run environment in this cost-competitiveness
approach, the rise of local prices also affects the international trade balance, hampering international
exports and increasing import penetration. This movement is important to switch the allocation of
resources towards components of domestic demand.

5. Concluding Remarks

         In this paper we developed a multiregional general equilibrium model for Greece to simulate the
short run impacts of temporary deficit-financed rises in government spending. It has long been recognized
that the fiscal multiplier is a function of structural features of the economy and policy reaction parameters.
Moreover, the debate on the magnitude of the multiplier along the business cycle has also been the subject
of disputed debates. On these grounds, we looked at the Greek case by calibrating the model using data
for distinct states of the Greek economy during the development of the recent crisis. Whether this matters
for local and nationwide multipliers depends on qualitative differences of the numerical structures of the
model. Our results imply that structural coefficients have a strong effect on government spending impact
