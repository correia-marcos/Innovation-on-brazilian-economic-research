RESUMO
A extensão rural tem apoiado os agricultores brasileiros desde os anos 50. A Política Nacional de
Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural (PNATER) remodelou este serviço nos anos 2000 e reforçou a
necessidade de prestar esses serviços às pequenas e muito pequenas fazendas e, entre outras finalidades,
diminuir a desigualdade de renda. Este trabalho busca identificar o efeito da extensão rural sobre a
desigualdade de renda e níveis de renda nas áreas rurais brasileiras. Utilizamos a pesquisa domiciliar
(PNAD) para 2014 e um método de decomposição de renda para identificar o efeito da extensão rural nos
diferentes quantis de renda. Nossos resultados indicam que, embora a extensão rural aumente a renda das
famílias rurais em todos os quantis de distribuição de renda, também aumenta a desigualdade de renda no
Brasil rural. O acesso ao crédito rural e à educação são os fatores que mais aumentam o efeito de extensão
sobre a renda.

ABSTRACT
Rural extension has been supporting Brazilian farmers since the 1950s. The National Policy on Technical
Assistance and Rural Extension (PNATER) remodeled this service in the 2000s and re-enforced the need
to provide these services to very small and small farms and, subsequently, decrease income inequality. This
paper seeks to identify the effect of rural extension on income and income inequality in the rural Brazil
areas. We use the household survey (PNAD) for 2014 and a method of income decomposition to identify
the effect of rural extension on the different income quantiles. Our findings indicate that although rural
extension increases rural household income in all income distribution quantiles, it also increases income
inequality in rural Brazil. Access to rural credit and education are the factors that most augment the
extension effect on income.
Key words: Rural extension, income inequality, unconditional quantile regression, decomposition

1. Introduction
      In developing countries, economic policies primarily target the reduction of poverty and income
concentration (Chakravarty et al., 2008). Food insecurity and poverty are the main obstacles to the
economic growth and development of rural areas. Three out of four people living in poverty reside in rural
areas and depend directly or indirectly on agricultural activity in developing countries including Brazil
(World Bank, 2007). Although the Brazilian agriculture has shown a stronger performance on domestic and
international markets in the last decades, this sector still faces high-income inequality. Alves et al. (2013)
show that in 2006, 87% of the Brazilian agricultural gross income was generated by 11.4% of farms in
country.

       Several public policies in Brazil that are based on income transfers and pensions have only had a
modest impact on the reduction of inequality. The labor-related income (both agricultural and non-
agricultural) still accounts for more than 70% of rural household income (Helfand et al., 2009). It suggests
that public policies should also seek to stimulate agricultural competitiveness by increasing access to rural
extension, rural credit and commodity markets. These policies could increase farmer productivity,
efficiency and competitiveness, which would subsequently decrease income inequality. On the other hand,
Barros et al. (2000) argues that public policies should also seek to affect areas beyond agricultural
production itself to reduce income inequality.
       The National Policy on Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (PNATER) is a public policy that
supports the rural sector by giving farmers access to rural extension. This service can increase farmer’s
access to new technologies, knowledge and information (Christopolos, 2010). There have been several
public policies on rural extension since the 1950s but it was the creation of PNATER in 2003 and the
institutionalization of Law No. 12,1885 on Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (ATER) in 2010 that
defined the socioeconomic guidelines of these policies (Rodrigues, 1997). However, only 22% of farmers
have had access to rural extension in 2006 (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics – IBGE, 2017)
and most of the small farmers have not accessed the services provided by rural extension (Alves et al.,
2013; Plata and Fernandes, 2011). This suggests that the current PNATER structure might not be achieving
the goal of reducing income inequality. In order to address this problem, it is important to identify the
effects of these services on income generation in the Brazilian agricultural sector.
       In this paper, we focus on identifying the effect of rural extension on household income using an
income decomposition proposed by Firpo et al. (2007) and the National Household Sample Survey
(PNAD6). This method consists, at a first stage, in the estimation of income regressions for different
unconditional quantiles of the income distribution. Then, we decomposed the income differential for the
groups considered (farmers that had access to extension versus those that did not) to identify the main
factors that explain the income gap across all analyzed quantiles.
       Our results suggest that although rural extension increases rural household income, it also increases
income inequality. We found that the private rural extension service has a greater effect on rural income
compared to the public service provision. These findings also indicate that schooling and access to rural
credit are the greatest factors contributing to the income differential between those who have had access to
extension and those who have not had access to extension.

2. Related Literature
      Rural extension can increase farm income in developing countries (Anderson and Feder, 2004), where
the majority of the population lives in rural areas and would observe a greater impact of these policies on
population welfare (Gautam, 2000). Rural extension service seeks to facilitate producers' access to new
technologies, knowledge and information, and develop producer’s management skills and technical
practices. Access to information and knowledge can have positive impact on the environment and the
family’s health (Alex, Ziip and Byerlee, 2002). Access to new technologies and techniques can increase
agricultural productivity and income, and reduce food insecurity, subsequently leading to a welfare gains
(Alex, Ziip and Byerlee, 2002; Christopolos, 2010).

2.1. Rural Extension in Brazil
      Rural extension services have taken place in Brazil since the nineteenth century (Bergarmasco, 1983),
mostly performed by non-governmental institutions that sought to assist with on-farm training (Pettan,
2010). The creation of the PNATER established new dimensions (economic and socioeconomic) to the
Brazilian rural extension service. PNATER structures the Brazilian rural extension as a "National

  According to Law No. 12,188, of January 11, 2010, technical assistance and rural extension is the informal education service,
of a continuous nature, in the rural environment, which promotes processes of management, production, processing and
marketing of activities and agricultural and non-agricultural services, including agroextractivist, forestry and artisanal activities
(MDA, 2017).

Decentralized Public Extension System" and encourages the participation of nongovernmental institutions,
private companies, unions and cooperatives in addition to public entities (Peixoto, 2009).
      The PNATER also includes goals in developing the rural environment in a sustainable way, the
adoption of ecologically based agriculture, ensuring sustainable food and nutritional security and the
generation of new agricultural and non-agricultural jobs (Ministry of Agrarian Development – MDA,
2017). However, large farms and farms in more developed agricultural regions continue to obtain greater
access to rural extension compared to smaller farms (Alves, 2013). It contradicts the new policy directions
of focusing on vulnerable groups.
      Farms in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil have been poorly provided with rural extension
services compared to other regions (Kageyama, 1990). Only 15% of the farms in the Northern region have
accessed these services compared to farms in the South, where 49% of them have had access. However, the
implementation of the PNATER has led to an increase in resources used on rural extension, from R$ 3
million on the 2001/02 crop season to R$ 1.1 billion on the 2015/16 crop season7 (Sistema Integrado de
Administração Financeira do Governo Federal – SIAFI, 2016).
      Despite the increase on resources designated to rural extension provision, several PNATER’s
obstacles have led to great disparities on the regional provision of extension service. For example, the
PNATER system still pays low wages for extension agents and faces large costs to provide rural extension
to several farms within the same municipality (Peixoto, 2014).

2.2. Income Inequality and Rural Extension
       Several studies have investigated the determinants of income and income inequality in rural areas in
Brazil but without explicitly considering the role of rural extension. Araújo et al. (2008) identified the
determinants of income inequality in rural areas of the Northeast region using data from the PNAD. They
calculated poverty indexes in addition to an income decomposition methodology proposed by Fei et al.
(1978). Their findings suggested a reduction in poverty during the period 1995-2001 and that the individual
educational level is the most relevant factor explaining income inequality. Mariano and Neder (2006) also
examined income inequality in the rural Northeast region of Brazil using data from the PNAD for the period
1999-2001. They calculated poverty indexes and their findings suggested that agricultural income have
contributed to reductions on income inequality and non-agricultural income was associated with greater
inequality.
       Ney and Hoffman (2009) identified the determinants of rural income focusing on the role of human
and physical capital of rural properties in Brazil using the Demographic Census of 2000. They have
estimated income models using the weighted least squares method and found that although physical capital
has been the main determinant of rural income, individual educational levels accounts for the largest share
of income inequality. They also found that human capital has a larger effect on non-agricultural income
compared to agricultural income.
       As for literature focusing on rural areas in other countries, some studies have analyzed the effect of
rural extension on income inequality. Deribew (2016) investigated the effect of rural extension on
household income and income inequality using information on 734 rural households in northern Ethiopia
using a decomposition of the Gini index and regressions of yield function. He identified a positive effect of
rural extension on rural household income and that the rural extension policy increases agricultural income
inequality and decreases non-agricultural income inequality. Akpan et al. (2016) identified the determinants
of poverty and income inequality among 300 young rural producers selected from the state of Akwa Ibom
in southern Nigeria using descriptive statistical analyzes and Logit regressions. They found that producers
with higher levels of schooling and with access to rural extension were less likely to be below the poverty
line. It implies that these factors are relevant to reduce income inequality. Akobundu et al. (2004) estimated
income gains from participating in a rural extension program in the state of Virginia to identify the effect
of rural extension on rural income. They used a two-step procedure to identify the determinants of
participation and the effect of the program on income. Results suggest that a single extension agent visit
was not enough to generate significant results, but income gains increase with greater participation.

        These studies highlight the relevance of rural extension in enabling the development of rural families.
Several other studies have investigated rural extension under a different perspective. A few papers have
identified the impact of rural extension on farm technical efficiency (Helfand and Levine, 2004, Magalhães
et al., 2011), farm production and productivity (Baloch and Thapa, 2016; Jin and Huffman, 2016) and farm
profit (Huffman and Evenson, 1989). Overall, they found that rural extension increases farm technical
efficiency, productivity, production and profitability.
        On the other hand, most of these studies have not focused on the effect of rural extension on rural
household income. The literature lacks a study that focus in this topic and uses a suitable methodology that
allows to identify the effect of rural extension on different points of the income distribution, as well as to
analyze the main factors that explain the difference of income between households that had access and did
not have access to extension service. This paper identifies these effects using the National Household
Sample Survey (PNAD) and the income decomposition methodology proposed by Firpo et al. (2007).
3. The application
        In this section, we present the dataset used to identify the effect of rural extension on income and the
empirical methodology used to achieve this goal. We first use the unconditional quantile regression method
to identify the effect of the rural extension on different income quantiles in the Brazilian rural area based
on Firpo et al. (2007, 2009). We then identify farmers’ characteristics that generate the income difference
between the groups of farms based on access to rural extension.

3.1. Data
        We use the 2014 National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) from the IBGE. A supplementary
questionnaire was provided to the households in the 2014 PNAD, which also surveyed whether the
household had access to rural extension services. In this paper, we define rural extension as what the
PNATER delineates as technical assistance and rural extension. Individuals self-declared employers or self-
employed as the main activity were questioned whether they have received any technical assistance during
the last year. These services were split in four categories: Technical Assistance and Rural Extension
Company (Empresa de Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural – EMATER)8; other government agencies
(federal, state or municipal); private company; or another source. We constructed three dummy variables
to represent access to rural extension based on these categories: rural extension (if rural extension was
carried out by any source); public rural extension (if extension was carried out by EMATER or another
government agency); and private rural extension (if extension was carried out by private company).
        In this paper, rural producers are those that are: 1) economically active; 2) employers or self-
employed workers; and 3) those whose main enterprise activity was agriculture. Our sample also included
a small portion of rural property managers residing in urban areas, which also appears in the microdata of
the Agricultural Census of 2006 (IBGE, 2017). After dropping missing values and outliers, the final sample
consists of 15,406 households. In our sample, 14.1% of the farmers had access to rural extension in 2014,
from those, 56% had access to public extension and 44% had access to private extension. Descriptive
statistics by type of access to this service and type of provision is presented in table 1.
        We use monthly household income in Brazilian currency (R$ - Reais) as a proxy to farmer income
as in Mariano and Neder (2006), and Ney and Hoffman (2009). Our analysis is based on monthly total
household income as opposed to income solely from agricultural activities. Even though an analysis of the
effect of rural extension on agricultural income could raise interesting insights, the focus of the PNATER
is to provide agricultural support in addition to generate non-agricultural jobs (MDA, 2017). Therefore, we
have opted to use total household income.
        In addition to a variable capturing access to rural extension, we have included the following variables:
       i) Gender: a dummy variable equals to 1 if the individual (head of the household) is male;
       ii) Race: a dummy variable equals to 1 if the individual is black;

       We observe that farmers that had access to rural extension services (group A hereafter) had an average
monthly income of R$ 4,051.00, while the average income of those that have not had access to rural
extension (group B hereafter), on average, was R$ 2,252.00. The large standard deviation of this variable
indicates great heterogeneity or a wide income distribution, which is captured by our quantile regression
analysis. Farmers in group A had a higher education level, on average, 7.3 years compared to farmers on
Group B that had, on average, 5.3 years. Farmers in Group A also had greater access to credit, on average,
43.4% of them had access to credit while only 7.7% of the farmer in Groups B had access.
       We do not observe a substantial difference of farmer’s age between groups, 85% of the sample is
male, 73% of sample resides in rural areas, and 75% of them own the farm. On average, the monthly
household income reported by farmers that had access to private rural extension (R$ 5,143) is 60% higher
than the average income of farms that had access to public rural extension service (R$ 3,200). Farmers that
had access to private rural extension services had a higher level of education and had greater access to
credit.

3.2 The unconditional quantile regression approach
       To identify the effects of rural extension on rural income and income inequality we use the
unconditional quantile regression approach proposed by Firpo et al. (2009) and the concept of Recentered
Influence Function (RIF). The influence function9 allows us to identify the relative effect (the influence) of
an individual observation on a statistic of interest (Silva and França, 2016). That is, for a statistic
distribution 𝑣(𝐹𝑦 ), the influence of each observation on 𝑣(𝐹𝑦 ) is given by the influence function
𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑣, 𝐹𝑦 ). The incorporation of the statistic 𝑣(𝐹𝑦 ) in the influence function results in the so-called
Recentered Influence Function, 𝑅𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑣) = 𝑣(𝑦) + 𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑣). It allows us to analyze the effects of
individual covariates on the statistical distribution of interest. We are interested on the distribution of the
quantiles but this approach can also be applied to different statistical distributions such as Gini coefficient,
variance, or others that can represent income inequality10.
                                                                                                        
   We define the -th quantile (𝑞𝜏 ) of the income distribution Y as q =  ( Fy ) = inf q q : Fy (q)   , and its     
influence function 𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑞𝜏 , 𝐹𝑦 ) as:
                        𝜏−1{𝑦≤𝑞𝜏 (𝐹𝑦 )}
    𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑞𝜏 , 𝐹𝑦 ) =                                                                                                        (1)
                         𝑓𝑦 (𝑞𝜏 (𝐹𝑦 ))
where 1{𝑦 ≤ 𝑞𝜏 (𝐹𝑦 )} is an indicator function, which shows whether the variable Y (monthly household
income) is less than or equal to the quantile 𝑞𝜏 , and 𝑓𝑦 (𝑞𝜏 (𝐹𝑦 )) represents the marginal density function of
the distribution of Y evaluated in 𝑞𝜏 .
   The Recentered Influence Function, which will replace the dependent variable Y in the unconditional
quantile analysis, is defined by the sum of the distribution statistics and their respective influence function,
𝑅𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑣, 𝐹𝑦 ) = 𝑣(𝐹𝑦 ) + 𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑣, 𝐹𝑦 ). Thus, adapting the expression to the  - th quantile (𝑞𝜏 ), the RIF for
each income quantile is given by:
                            𝜏−1{𝑦≤𝑞𝜏 (𝐹𝑦 )}
𝑅𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑞𝜏 , 𝐹𝑦 ) = 𝑞𝜏 +                                                                                                      (2)

  The influence function method provides a linear approximation for a nonlinear function of a statistical distribution of interest,
such as quantiles, variance or others, allowing us to estimate the effect of one or more covariates on the distribution of the
statistics of interest (Chi andLee, 2008). For more details, see Chi and Lee (2008) and Firpo et al. (2009).
10
   For an average, e.g.  ( F y ) , the influence function - IF, would be given by IF ( y;  ( Fy )) = y −  ( Fy ) , with the RIF
specified as: RIF ( y;  ) = IF ( y;  ) +  . Firpo et al. (2007) present the RIF regressions for the case of the variance and Gini
coefficient.
                                                                                                                                   7
   We first obtain the sample quantile 𝑞̂𝜏 (Firpo et al., 2009; Koenker and Basset, 1978) and then the
marginal density function 𝑓̂𝑦 (𝑞̂𝜏 ) using Kernel functions. After obtaining these estimates, they are
incorporated in (2).
   Assume a covariate vector X and the conditional expectation of the RIF as a function of X; i.e.
𝐸[𝑅𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑣, 𝐹𝑦 )|𝑋 = 𝑥]. Then, it can be represented as a linear regression in function of X, 𝑅𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑣, 𝐹𝑦 ) =
𝑋𝛽 + 𝜀. Assuming 𝐸[𝜀|𝑋] = 0 and applying the Law of Iterated Expectations, we have the unconditional
quantile regression
   𝑣(𝐹𝑦 ) = 𝐸𝑋 [𝐸[ 𝑅𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑣, 𝐹𝑦 )]] = 𝐸[𝑋]. 𝛽                                                         (4)
where y represents the monthly rural household income; 𝑅𝐼𝐹(𝑦; 𝑣, 𝐹𝑦 ) is the Recentered Influence
Function, which replaces the observed y in each observation; X is the vector of explanatory variables; and 𝛽
are the coefficients of interest, which capture the effect of changing the distribution of a variable on the
unconditional quantile of y or the unconditional quantile partial effect (Firpo et al., 2009). We can use
Ordinary Least Squares or another linear estimator to estimate these coefficients11.

3.3. Decomposition of the income differentials
   We use an income decomposition procedure proposed by Firpo et al. (2007)12 to estimate the income
differentials between groups. It consists of estimating the RIF regression along with a re-weighting scheme
proposed by DiNardo et al. (1996). It is an adaptation of the Oaxaca-Blinder13 decomposition approach,
which allows us to expand the decomposition to other statistics of interest such as quantiles, variance and
Gini coefficient.
   Assume two groups of households: A (farmers that had access to rural extension) and B (farmers that
had not had access to rural extension); an outcome variable Y (logarithm of household incomes); and a
group of covariates that represents individual’s characteristics. The decomposition seeks to identify the
difference in the income distributions of the two groups based on some statistics of these distributions as
opposed to only analyzing the mean. It is represented as
∆𝑣 = 𝑣(𝐹𝑦𝐴 ) − 𝑣(𝐹𝑦𝐵 )                                                                                    (5)
where 𝑣(𝐹𝑦𝑡 ) represents a statistic of the income distribution (income quantiles on this paper), for two
groups t = A, B.
   The term ∆𝑣 is then divided in two components: difference in the observable individual’s characteristics
(Composition Effect); and difference in coefficients between the two groups (Return Effect). To implement
this decomposition, first a counterfactual distribution (𝐹𝑦𝐶 ) has to be obtained in addition to its statistics of
interest, 𝑣(𝐹𝑦𝐶 ), such as in (10). It allows us to simulate an income distribution with characteristics of group
A and the returns (coefficients) to the characteristics of group B. We can insert 𝐹𝑦𝑐 in (5) to obtain
   ∆𝑣 = [𝑣(𝐹𝑦𝐵 ) − 𝑣(𝐹𝑦𝐶 )] + [𝑣(𝐹𝑦𝐶 ) − 𝑣(𝐹𝑦𝐴 )]                                                          (6)
     𝑣     𝑣    𝑣
   ∆ = ∆𝑅 + ∆𝑋
where the total income differential is decomposed into two terms: ∆𝑣𝑅 , which represents the portion of the
differential resulting from the differences in the returns (coefficients) of the characteristics (return effect);
and ∆𝑋𝑣 , which represents the portion of the differential associated with the differences in the distributions
of the characteristics (composition effect).
   To obtain (6) we re-estimate the RIF regressions for each of the groups and obtain the conditional
expectation. This allows us to obtain the expected value of the RIF for the observed distributions 𝑣(𝐹𝑦𝑡 ) and
the counterfactual distribution 𝑣(𝐹𝑦𝐶 ) in a linear specification

11
  Firpo et al. (2009) present three possibilities of estimators: ordinary least squares, logistic estimator, and a non-parametric
estimator. However, the results presented by the three methods were very close, and the advantage of one estimator over other
cannot be tested.
12
  This method has been used in other studies such as in Machado and Mata (2005).
13
   The traditional Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition approach (Blinder, 1973; Oaxaca, 1973) consists of decomposing the mean
income differences (or other outcome variable) of two groups of individuals into two components: one associated with the
observed characteristics and the other related to the return of such characteristics, allowing also to identify the contribution of
each explanatory variable over the total estimated difference. For more details, see Jann (2008).
                                                                                                                                      8

for t = A, B. To obtain the parameters of interest 𝛽, Firpo et al. (2007) uses a reweighting technique based
on the study of DiNardo et al. (1996). The reweighting factors for each group are obtained by the probability
that a farmer had access to rural extension given the characteristics vector X and may be estimated using a
probability model such as Logit or Probit (Chi and Li, 2008). Then, the weighted RIF regressions can be
estimated by OLS to obtain the parameters 𝛽̂ for each group.
     Thus, the decomposition presented in (11) can be obtained as
∆ = [𝑋̅𝐵 . 𝛽̂𝐵 − 𝑋̅𝐶 . 𝛽̂𝐶 ] + [𝑋̅𝐶 . 𝛽̂𝐶 − 𝑋̅𝐴 . 𝛽̂𝐴 ]

where in (11) the first term (difference in the returns of the covariate k = 1) represents the difference in the
intercepts of the regressions of groups A and B, and the second term represents the contribution of the
return of each covariate in the total return effect. Thus, a positive result for a given covariate, for example
schooling, in (10) would indicate that farmer’s higher schooling level augment the rural extension effect on
the income differential between farmers that had access to the extension service and those that had not. A
positive result in (11) would indicate that the increase in the income differential is explained by the higher
return (coefficient) of schooling by farmers with rural extension14.

4. Results and discussion
      We first present the results of the unconditional quantile regression15 and then the results of the
income decomposition. Our results suggest that rural extension increases both rural income and income
inequality. Results of the income differential decomposition have shown that higher schooling level and
access to rural credit augment the effect of rural extension on rural income but also contribute to the
aggravation of the income inequality.

4.1. Effect of rural extension in rural income
      The results of the RIF regressions for the unconditional income distribution quantiles of the logarithm
of monthly household income using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) are displayed in Table 2. The estimated
coefficients have shown variation along the income distribution quantiles when compared to the estimated
coefficients obtained for the mean (OLS). It implies that rural extension and individual’s characteristics
affect household income differently in each of the income quantiles and it re-enforces the need to use the
unconditional quantile regression approach.

   Fortin et al. (2011) argue that one of the main shortcomings of this method is that the feedback effect is sensitive to the choice
of the base group, although they also indicate that there still no way of correcting this limitation. On the other hand, this method
is path independent, which means that the order in which the different elements of the detailed decomposition are calculated
does not affect the results of the decomposition (Oliveira and Silveira Neto, 2015).

   A possible endogeneity issue related to the adoption of rural extension might affect the outcome of the unconditional
quantile regression. We did not address this issue given the absence of adequate instrumental variables.

       Our results indicate a statistically positive effect of rural extension service on rural income. This
effect increases as we evaluate higher income quantiles of the distribution. Farmers in group A face a higher
income compared to farmers in group B in the bottom two income quantiles, 28.5% and 33.9% respectively
(q10 and q20). The distance between the two immediate quantiles decreases as we evaluate higher quantiles;
i.e. for q80 and q90, the increase on income are 58.1% and 60.1%, respectively. These results imply that
these services raise monthly household income and, on the other hand, increase income inequality in rural
Brazil. These results contradict one of the main objectives of this service, to increase rural income through
the dissemination of new technologies and reduction of the negative effects caused by market imperfections
(Alves et al., 2013). The greater access to this service by large and more profitable farms re-enforces the
maintenance of income inequality in rural areas. Deribew (2016) found a similar result for Ethiopian
farmers in which results suggest a positive effect of rural extension on the rural income and an increase on
income inequality in the agricultural activity16.
       Individual’s characteristics such as gender and race have not shown a great discriminatory effect
throughout the income distribution. Households headed by females have shown greater income compared
to male headed households only at the bottom of the income distribution. We also find that black individuals
faced lower income compared to non-black individuals but there is no clear pattern along the income
distribution.
       Our results indicate that a higher level of education such as “complete elementary school”, “high
school” and “higher education” is associated with a greater income compared to the base variable, “people
who cannot read or write”. Duarte et al. (2003), Oliveira and Silveira Neto (2015), and Reis et al. (2017)
have also identified positive effects of investments in human capital on income for Brazil. Our results show
that education can decrease income inequality. We observe a great income return to “high school” level in
the bottom quantiles of the distribution. On the other hand, “higher education” increases inequality, but,
note that, only 3.2% of the sample had access to high education. As Ney and Hoffman (2009) suggested,
these results show the significant role of human capital on explaining rural income inequalities.
       Farmer’s experience, in this paper represented by age, has a stronger effect at the bottom of income
distribution; i.e. older individuals are related to higher income level compared to those younger than 25
years of age (base category). It implies that experience contributes to the reduction of rural income
inequality. Our results also suggest that access to rural credit increases income, which is probably
associated to improvements on farm productive capacity through acquisition of inputs and new
technologies. This factor increases income by at least 17% at the bottom of the distribution and up to 41%
at the top of the distribution.
       Farm ownership increases income. We found that land ownership of the types partners, occupant
and other classifications face lower income compared to farm owners (base category) in all quantiles of the
income distribution. Farm owners have a greater incentive to invest in innovations and in other long-term
technology, which increase rural income. These properties also have greater access to credit and other
services since farmers can use their land as a tangible guarantee for the fulfillment of financial obligations
(Besley, 1995). Farmers that reside in rural areas are associated with lower income in all quantiles of the
income distribution. Farmers’ residence in urban areas might grant them greater access to information about
markets, banking institutions and other services.
       In Table 3, we display the effect of rural extension on income by source of this service. Figure 1
shows the effect of rural extension, both aggregate and disaggregate by source, on income. Our findings
indicate that private rural extension has a greater effect on rural income compared to public service. Private
service has a larger effect on income on the top part of the income distribution (q90) compared to the public
service. This service increases rural income in 88.7% compared to non-adopters while the public service
increases income in 35.5%. This result is probably associated with resource restriction that small and low-
income farmers face, which limits the effect of rural extension on income. Additionally, large farmers have
greater access to a more specialized private extension service. It explains the increasing income gap
between the sources of extension as higher income quantiles are considered.

  However, when considering different sources of income from livestock and other non-agricultural sources, Deribew (2016)
finds a negative effect of rural extension on income inequality.

4.2. Decomposition of income differentials
       The data indicates that farmer’s characteristics are different between farms in groups A and B and
our findings presented in the previous subsection indicate that rural extension increases rural income and
income inequality. Therefore, we use the income decomposition method along with the RIF regressions to
evaluate how much of the income differences between the farm groups is attributed to the composition
effect and to the return effect. The former effect represents the differences in the distribution of the
individual’s characteristics and the latter effect represents the differences in the returns of these
characteristics. It allows us to identify the contribution of each variable to these effects, presented in the
Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix, and Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5.
       Figure 2 displays the decomposition of the income differential between groups A and B in the
composition effect and return effect. Farmers that had access to rural extension are associated with a greater
income in all quantiles compared to farmers that had not accessed this service. The composition effect
increases along with the quantiles; i.e. the differences in the individual characteristics such as schooling
level and access to rural credit explain almost the entire income gap between such groups in the top tier of
the income distribution. However, the return effect represents most of the total effect on income. It implies
that the high returns to the explanatory variables explains most of the income differential.

       Figure 3 displays the detailed decomposition of the composition effect. Schooling and access to rural
credit are the main factors explaining greater income for farmers that had access to rural extension (group
A) compared to farmers in group B. Farmer’s experience affects income negatively. It is an important
contributing factor to household income for farmers that had not had access to rural extension service.
Farmers that had access to rural extension take advantage of the extension agent suggestions to manage
their production rather than relying only on their (farmer’s) experience. Characteristics such as gender and
race (included in Others in Figure 3) contribute to the reduction of the income differential between the two
groups.
       The returns to extension service might be restricted among the low-income farmers due to their
restricted access to education and credit. Higher education levels facilitate their interaction with the
extension agents allowing them to absorb information and implement the technical recommendations more
precisely. Alves et al. (2013) also indicate that larger farmers have greater access to rural credit, which
allows them to invest in modern inputs and adopt technologies that are more productive. It implies that the
current structure of the national rural extension policy is reinforcing social inequalities.

   Figure 4 displays the return effect for each group of farmers. Although we observe a decreasing effect
of schooling on rural income, this variable contributes considerably to the increase of income in the first
two income quantiles. For the first quantile, 2.8% of the farmers had a complete high school degree while
for the last quantile, 5.0% completed high school. It implies that lower schooling levels have a higher return
(marginal effect) in lower quantiles. Public policies that seek to incentivize the conclusion of high school
(or school attendance) among low-income farmers would benefit them since it would boost the rural
extension effect on their income.

areas of Brazil, 2014.

       Our findings have indicated a distinct return to rural extension by source of provision. To decouple
this effect, we decompose these income differentials by source of provision in the two effects described
previously. Figure 5 displays the returns to private provision of extension services compared to public
provision (base).
       The total income differential between the groups of farmers (farmers that had access to private and
public rural extension services) has a U-shape format. The return effect explains most of the income
differential. It implies that the returns to the individual’s characteristics such as schooling and access to
rural credit explains most of the observed greater income obtained by farmers that had access to private
rural extension service.
       Schooling has played a significant role on augmenting the effect of rural extension on household
income. Public policies that incentivize farmer’s school attendance would have a spillover effect given that
it would also increase their benefits from accessing rural extension. These results also suggest that rural
households might benefit from the alignment of public policies on provision of rural credit and rural
extension. Already in place, the National Policy of Family Agriculture and Rural Family Enterprises
(PRONAF) seeks to provide credit to small farms. In 2017, this policy has provided credit to 1.1 million
farmers for a total close R$ 21 million17 (Banco Central do Brasil - BACEN, 2018).

     Our findings suggest that although public provision of extension service increases rural household
income, the private service is more efficient in achieving greater income. It implies that there is room for
improvements on the public provision. Lower-income farmers (see Figure 5) would benefit from efficiency
improvements on the provision of public extension, which would increase household income.

5. Conclusions
       Although Brazilian rural areas still rely on agricultural activities to generate income, agricultural
production is mainly produced by large farmers. Access to rural extension could be a tool to increase income
and decrease inequality in these areas. In this paper, we use household survey and a method of income
decomposition to test whether access to rural extension increases income and decreases inequality.
       Our results indicate that rural extension increases rural household income and income inequality,
failing to achieve one of the goals of this service, which is to reduce inequality (Alves et al., 2013). Access
to private rural extension has a stronger effect on rural income compared to public extension. Wealthier
farmers, at the top portion of the income distribution, observe a stronger effect of rural extension on income
compared to the low-income farmers at the lower portion of the income distribution. Larger farmers and
farm owners also have greater access to rural credit, as confirmed by Alves et al. (2013), since these farmers
can use the land as a tangible guarantee for the fulfillment of their financial obligations (Besley, 1995).
       Individual’s characteristics explains great part of the income differential between the groups of
farmers. A greater level of schooling and access to rural credit augment the effect of rural extension on
rural income but also contribute to the aggravation of the income inequality. It confirms the relevance of
the effect of human capital on income, as also found by Duarte et al. (2003), Oliveira and Silveira Neto
(2015), and Reis et al. (2017) for Brazil.
       These findings suggest that access to rural extension alone is not enough to raise social welfare of the
low-income farmers. These farmers are constrained by the limited access to credit and schooling. The
design and implementation of a joint public policy that incorporates components of rural extension
provision, of access to rural credit and of the promotion of the human capital would help to achieve the
goal of reducing income inequality. In Brazil, some public policies already deal separately with these
components. The PRONAF seeks to provide credit to small farms while the Food Acquisition Program
(PAA) seeks to reduce hunger and poverty.
