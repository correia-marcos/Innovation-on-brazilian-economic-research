       Brazilian municipalities have part of their revenues coming from federal transfers,
       among them, the FPM scheme stands out because it has a direct relationship with
       the size of the population of each municipality. Through the use of FPM allocation
       rules, we have specified a Fuzzy Discontinuity Regression to identify the causal effect
       of an exogenous resource increase on migratory variables. Our results show that the
       increase in federal transfers leads to a decrease in in-migration and an increase in
       out-migration, although the first seems more relevant, which could indicate that
       individuals are not able to correctly assess whether and how this increment of
       resources is spent and, therefore, an outward trend could be observed for this group
       of municipalities. Our results do not find evidence of welfare migration in Brazil.

Introduction
        Migration has always been a phenomenon of great interest for society, however, in
the last years, migration has become a central concern for public policy, particularly after
the most recent cases of mass migration and efforts to avoid in-migration in developed
countries. Examples of events that brought back the spotlight to this matter are the Trump
wall and the mass migration of Asian and African countries to Europe, in which the debate
is surrounded by opinions of costs, benefits, and controversy. In developing countries, the
recent case of Venezuela might be one of the most emblematic episodes of out-migration
in South America and also caused a lot of discussions, especially in countries that share
borders with it, like Colombia and Brazil.
        Internal migration is just as intriguing as international migration and is also subject
to a lot of controversies. McAuliffe e Ruhs (2017) report that more than 740 million people
had migrated within their own country of birth, which seems to indicate that it might be
important to understand the reasons that make people leave their home cities, notably
when public policy is being discussed. According to Drabo e Mbaye (2015) several channels
might affect the decision to migrate, such as new labor opportunities, natural disasters,
agriculture and nutrition, climate change and war events, but in our case, the main interest
is related to the regional public finance, that is welfare spending and tax revenue.
        The literature on welfare migration and public finance is very broad, ranging from
welfare competition and strategic interaction models such as Tiebout (1956), Oates et al.
(1972) and Brueckner (2000) to welfare migration models and empirical studies like Borjas
(2011), Giulietti e Wahba (2013) and many others. All those studies tried to investigate
how public finance and migration could be related. Overall findings indicate that migration
could arise due to welfare spending, meaning that individuals could leave their home
regions to a different one if the benefits of doing so are higher than its costs. At the same
time, individuals could also leave their home regions if tax collection increase, raising the
cost to keep living in a given area. These findings are particularly interesting when we
explore how heterogeneous it could be since foster the in-migration of poor individuals
could raise the fiscal burden for the other individuals, but fostering in-migration of highly
educated individuals could raise tax collection and also the amount of income spent in a
given municipality.
        To have a better understanding on how this channel works it is imperative to
address some sort of causal methodology and for that reason, we’ll explore a Brazilian
federal transfer law called Fundo de participação dos municípios, or FPM, which displays
exogenous variation due to its allocation mechanism based on population brackets. Since
the amount of federal transfers increases with population, it creates incentives for some
municipalities to attract people, and therefore, increase their revenues. At the same time,
a higher amount of revenues could be used to increase the quality of the public services,
so that if we assume that individuals can compare and distinguish which location supplies
better public services we could have a case of welfare migration. More formally, we have
specified a Fuzzy Discontinuity Regression to identify the causal effect of an exogenous
resource increase on different migratory measures.
       This paper aims to contribute to the migration literature by using a causal method-
ology to assess the impact of an exogenous rule over migration variables. To do that, we
reviewed several works that have used FPM discontinuities such as Brollo et al. (2013)
and Corbi, Papaioannou e Surico (2018). Our analysis is closest to Mata (2015), but we
do not restrict our database to only São Paulo state and we use the effective number

of migrants instead of relying on population and housing market growth1 as we seek to
have a better understanding of the fiscal channel related to migration. In other words, we
want to get more insight into how migration might be affected when facing an exogenous
fiscal windfall via the municipality behavior over its public spending and fiscal effort.
Municipalities that have just crossed one cutoff have an incentive to have a lower fiscal
effort since their revenues are guaranteed due to the FPM population scheme, however as
the population grows and per capita spending decreases, the incentive shifts to raise fiscal
effort. Considering that public service quality might vary even more than per capita revenue
across population sizes, attraction and repulsion should be a concern for in-migration
just as evasion and retention for out-migration2 . Gadenne (2017) found that governments
spend increases in tax revenues more toward expenditures that raise citizens’ welfare than
increases in grant revenues. If the way governments are financed matters, this must be
addressed when we talk about welfare migration.
       Our results show that there seems to have a higher impact of an increase in federal
transfers over in-migration than out-migration. Also, we found no support for welfare
migration in Brazil, probably because individuals can’t correctly evaluate how those
revenue increases are being spent since it probably has little effect on their welfare.
         The rest of the paper is structured as follows. After this introduction, we present a
brief literature review and the institutional background and data. Section four discusses
the estimation and the last section concludes.


1 Literature
        The literature on welfare migration is very broad. Tiebout (1956) is probably the
first paper to theorize about the theme. As stated by Tiebout, in the absence of transaction
costs, local governments, or jurisdictions, would supply different sets of goods so that
individuals could choose those in which the amount of public spending and tax revenue
would satisfy their utility functions, thereby promoting migration to that jurisdiction.
His take on this matter is also known as "voting with feet" in allusion to the locational
decision faced by individuals. Ross e Yinger (1999) demonstrate that without a head tax,
Tiebout’s framework might generate a large distortion between the supply of public goods
and their funding. The main problem occurs when a property tax is imposed, which would
stimulate poor individuals to migrate since their contributory capacity is lower due to the
smaller size of their houses. As a consequence, the marginal cost of public goods would
increase for the other consumers and, for this reason, jurisdictions could try to prevent the
in-migration of poor people to their region or, in some cases, develop some sort of fiscal
zone to homogenize the individuals tax capacity and supply of public goods (Hamilton
(1975)).
        Another branch of the literature disagrees with Tiebout’s type models. For these
studies, inter-jurisdictional competition would not generate a race to the top process. Oates
et al. (1972) has demonstrated that competition among local governments would lead to

    When population growth is used, migration is just one part of the effect, since births and deaths
    also change population size. Moreover, although housing growth displays a strong correlation with
    migration, it is far from being free from criticism, since housing market could increase/decrease without
    migration if there is some sort of pent-up demand in that region
2
    To be able to assess more accurately how those forces influence municipality fiscal behavior, an origin,
    and destination approach is recommended because each observation is a destination and an origin at
    the same time (Oliveira e Chagas (2017)). One model that could be used is a gravitational Spatial
    Interaction Model, but in this case, our causality claim would be lost.

sub-provision of public services due to either strategic interaction or welfare migration.
Our main interest lies in the second case, where the sub-provision of public goods could
happen due to low-income migrants seeking to enjoy higher benefits in a given jurisdiction.
To avoid the distortion between costs and benefits, local governments might deliberately
lower public spending to amounts below the social optimum. Brueckner (2000) explores a
welfare migration model in which migration equilibrium happens when the total income
of poor people3 from jurisdiction J1 equals the total income that could be perceived in
jurisdiction J2 . The basic implication of the model is that when one jurisdiction increases
the number of benefits supplied, it becomes more attractive to migrants, resulting in an
inflow of people and an increase in the marginal cost of public services for the non-poor.
Considering that political and financial power is higher for the non-poor, they could
pressure for a lower level of public spending to restrain unwanted migration, since their
higher-income allowed then to search for private services instead of public ones. Brueckner
(2003) also emphasizes that models of welfare competition also falls into the resource-flow
category, so that a reaction function could be calculated.
        Borjas (2011) discussed the welfare magnet hypothesis, which is related to the
welfare migration theory. According to the author, migratory decisions would be influenced
by the generosity of the welfare system of a given destination. There are several empirical
studies about welfare migration, some of those find evidence of the phenomenon. Among
those studies, there are those which evaluate a specific population (Blank (1988), Meyer
et al. (1998)), public education expenditures (Speciale (2012)), family aid programs
((JR, 1981), labor market selectivity (Razin (2013), Razin e Wahba (2015), Bhagwati
e Hanson (2009), Jasso e Rosenzweig (2008)) and overall size of the generosity of the
welfare state (Giorgi e Pellizzari (2009)). Other studies didn’t find any strong evidence
between migration and welfare generosity (Walker e Poverty (1994), Levine e Zimmerman
(1999)). In conclusion, empirical evidence is quite mixed and this is probably due to
the fact that most of these studies do not consider endogeneity or ignore the migration
regime (whether immigration is free or restricted) to assess how welfare policy might affect
migration.(Giulietti e Wahba (2013)).
        The literature on RDD and FPM discontinuities was used to assess different
empirical questions and is growing rather fast. Brollo et al. (2013) have found a positive
effect of FPM transfer over different measures of corruption, Litschig e Morrison (2010)
were able to identify that an increase in transfers would cause the likelihood of reelection
and local public spending to also increase. Litschig e Morrison (2013) found a direct impact
of FPM transfers on development indicators such as schooling per capita and literacy
rates, which seems to indicate that the higher revenues are indeed spent to offer better
public services. Corbi, Papaioannou e Surico (2018) identified the causal effect of public
spending on local labor markets and were able to show that most of this effect comes from
services and it is more pronounced in municipalities where individuals face some sort of
liquidity constraint, Mata (2015) identified that the municipalities of São Paulo state that
are less dependent on federal grants have a faster growing housing sector. The author also
theorizes about how municipalities at different sides of the population threshold would
relate to migration in his setting and concludes that land use would play a key role at
retaining or attracting people, depending on if the benefits of new land-use regulations
surpass it costs 4 .

2 Institutional Background and Data
        The proclamation of the constitution of 1988 completely changed how Brazilian
public finance would be managed by promoting a more decentralized orientation. Since
then, the 26 States and 5570 municipalities share different responsibilities regarding tax
collection and supply of public goods. For example, local governments, which are the
lowest level of administration, are in charge of services more closely related to a specific
population such as public transportation, primary education, street lighting, garbage
collection, urban planning, and city maintenance. Other services, which demand a larger
scale, are usually the responsibility of a higher instance of the government, such as the
federal government. According to Carneiro (2014), such division aims to increase the
efficiency in the provision of public services.
        Municipality governments, or municípios, acquire their revenue from transfers or
from their fiscal effort5 . Taxes on services and property are the biggest shares of revenue
related to the local fiscal performance, despite this, it roughly represents 4% of total
municipal revenue in our sample, so that it is required some sort of transfer to complement
the fiscal budget. There are two main types of transfers, Constitutional direct transfers,
and indirect transfers, the former are the ones in which the financial resource is directly
passed to the mayor, or prefeito, and the latter are those which is necessary some sort of
fund. In general, transfers’ purpose is to mitigate regional disparities, so that resources are
passed on to the needy areas. Among the different types of transfers, the most important
is the FPM fund, or Fundo de Participação dos Municípios, which was constituted by
22,5% of the Income tax and Industrial Product Tax until 2007, when the Constitutional
Amendment 55/2007 added 1% to that amount. From that date on the new amount to be
passed would be 23,5%. Taking into account such change, the FPM program represented
35,4% of total revenues in both years 2000 and 2010 in our sample6 .

    on education and 15 percent on health care

Tributário Nacional, in 1966 and was subsequently ratified for the Federal Constitution
of 1967. There were some changes over the years, but from 1988 until recent years, the
basic scheme remains practically the same. The financial resource allocated to the fund is
redistributed to the 26 states following a fixed share rule. Within each state, those funds
are then distributed to the municipalities according to a coefficient rule determined by
population brackets. The coefficients and population brackets are presented in figure 1.
        The resource allocated to the FPM fund is distributed as follows. First, the Brazilian
statistical agency (IBGE) estimates the population for the next year. Second, the Federal
Audit Court, or Tributal de Contas da União - TCU, generates the transfer share to be
designated to each municipality following the legal basis. As said before, the calculation
uses a fixed share for each state and a coefficient for each municipality based on its
population. Finally, the amount of FPM transfers received by municipality i in state k
and year t is7

where F P Mk,t represents the total revenue received for state k, ψ(popi,t−1 ) is the coefficient
bracket calculated with IBGE’s population estimates in the previous year. The denominator
sums all municipalities coefficients in state k.

       Data on population are obtained from IBGE. We also use the estimated population

Municipal fiscal data was collected on the National Treasury’s website, Tesouro Nacional -
FINBRA. It includes variables related to public expenditures and revenue sources, like
health expenditure, local taxes, the actual amount of FPM transfers received by each
municipality and many others. Municipal characteristics were retrieved from PNUD,
Programa das Nações Unidas para o Desenvolvimento, which uses data from the Brazilian
Census.
        Finally, migration data was also retrieved from the Brazilian Census. To count
the number of individuals that migrated we used the question about where (which city)
the individual was five years ago and with that information we computed two different
measures of migration, in-migration and out-migration. Both variables were calculated for
the role sample (in_mig_tot and out_mig_tot), high educated individuals(in_mig_b
and out_mig_b)8 and vulnerable individuals(in_mig_p and out_mig_p)9 . The data was
collected for years 2000 and 201010 , monetary values were measured in 2010 prices and we
follow Brollo et al. (2013) and used only municipalities within 6796 - 50940 inhabitants
range.11

Theoretical transfers are slightly lower, with an average of R$6.42 million. Figure 2 shows
the population histogram with FPM’s cutoffs. It’s clear that something happens next to
the cutoffs so that the histogram displays peaks exactly close to then, especially for the
first 3 cutoffs. The FPM redistribution system is the main incentive for small municipalities
to cross a threshold so that more money enters it’s budget, improving the possibilities in
which a mayor might decide to spend that exogenous revenue increase.

        Figure 3 explores this relationship and tries to shed some light on the phenomenon.
As it can be seen, the distribution follows the same pattern of the histograms, that is,
municipalities that cross one threshold receive more resources from the FPM fund, which
is exactly how the scheme was supposed to work, and why it is possible to see sharp jumps
at the cutoffs. Figures on the left report the actual FPM transfers and those on the right,
the amount of transfers that would be received if the regulation was perfectly enforced.


3 Empirical Strategy
        The institutional background described above is a good candidate to implement a
regression discontinuity approach due to the fact that FPM transfers change abruptly at
the cutoffs. Therefore, population movements around the cutoffs are possible sources of
exogenous variation.
        Let Ti = 1 if unit i received the treatment and Ti = 0 otherwise. Our running
variable, which determines the treatment, is the population size, Zi . If we consider that Ti
is a deterministic function of Zi , a Sharp RDD would be the right choice to estimate the
causal effect of regional transfers on migration. However, as we showed in figure 3, there is
imperfect compliance with the treatment and for this reason, a Fuzzy RDD seems more
accurate. In a Fuzzy RDD, treatment eligibility is different from receiving the treatment,
so that the probability of receiving the treatment can be different than zero or one, and it
also tells us that the greater the population, the higher the probability of receiving more
FPM transfers.
       We follow Brollo et al. (2013) to estimate the causal impact of exogenous movements
across population thresholds on migration outcomes. In other words, we use the theoretical
transfers (τˆi ) as an "instrument" assignment and the actual transfers (τi ) as the observed

treatment under imperfect compliance. Equations (1) and (2) display the "first stage" and
reduced form of our specifications.

                              τi = f (Pi ) + ατ τˆi + θt + φst + ui                         (2)


                              yi = f (Pi ) + αy τˆi + θt + φst + ηi                         (3)
where f (Pi ) is a high order polynomial in Pi , θt time fixed effects, φst state fixed effects,
both errors ui and ηi are clustered at the municipality level, yi are our migration outcome
measures (in-migration, out-migration and migration balance). The coefficient ατ identifies
the reduced-form (or first-stage) effect of theoretical transfers on actual transfers. The
coefficient αy identifies the reduced-form effect of theoretical transfers on the outcomes.
        Considering the continuity assumption, FPM transfers must be the only factor that
changes at the population thresholds. To make sure that no other policies are relevant we
shall test that all other than FPM factors affecting migration are continuous at the cutoffs.
As noted by Brollo et al. (2013) within the 6792-50940 population range there is only
one exception, that is the 10,000 inhabitants, which is about the wage-cap between city
counselors and state legislators. The authors also tested if the confounding policy would
have any influence in their results and showed that it was not the case since the results
were not driven by the first cutoff (10189 inhabitants). The other situation that we should
check is if there is some sort of manipulation on the running variable. Monasterio (2013)
found some degree of manipulation when comparing TCU’s estimates and IBGE’s so that
the density is higher just above some cutoffs, which would be a potential problem for
our identification. Brollo et al. (2013), Corbi, Papaioannou e Surico (2018), Mata (2015)
and Gadenne (2017) presented evidences that results were not affected by any sort of
manipulation in the running variable. Eggers et al. (2018) also provided instruments to
address those problems.
      Under the continuity assumption, we can estimate the causal effect of FPM transfers
on migration. To do that we estimate:

                              yi = f (Pi ) + αy τi + θt + φst + ηi                          (4)

       Equation (2) displays the first stage of the predicted FPM amount on the actual
FPM. The second stage in Equation (4) estimates the effect of the FPM on migration.
Equation (4) will be estimated for all our migration measures. Note that this strategy will
only identify any effect for municipalities around the cutoffs and, besides this, only for the
compliers, in other words, observations that receive larger transfers because of the FPM
mechanism.
        We also estimated those equations with two bandwidths (2.5% and 5%), meaning
that local linear regressions include all municipalities within a 2.5 and 5 percent bandwidths
of a normalized population cutoff.

Notes: The density test is described by McCrary (2008). The data on population is from the 2000 and 2010 Brazilian Census.
The cutoffs are given by the FPM distribution rule.


        Figure 4 displays the McCrary (2008) test. It shows some signs of manipulation, as
pointed by Monasterio (2013). Previous studies about this theme usually had years other
than census years for their data. Unfortunately, we can only use the Brazilian census to
identify individuals who migrated. The census years are more troublesome in this aspect
because municipalities can actually observe their population and try to incentive migration
if they realize that population estimates of the previous year are close to an upper cutoff.
This evidence seems to be more concerning for 2010 and the lower cutoffs. As shown by
Lee e Lemieux (2010), a regression discontinuity design requires that individuals have
imprecise control over the running variable12 . If there is precise control over the running
variable and it correlates with migration outcomes, then we can’t estimate any causal
effect. According to Eggers et al. (2018), we can also check for discontinuities by testing
if the pre-treatment observable characteristics near the cutoff are similar. Mata (2015)
showed no signs of evident jumps on pre-treatment characteristics, also Gadenne (2017)
briefly explained how population estimates are constructed in Brazil and pointed out that
none of the previous studies indicating that population densities are higher just above the
cutoffs found signs of deliberate manipulation in the IBGE’s population estimates.


4 Estimation and Discussion
        This section will evaluate how migration outcomes respond to exogenous changes
in regional transfers. To do that we need to discuss some prior assumptions related to
the empirical design. First, as we pointed on in figure 3, there seems to be some sort of
discontinuity due to the FPM scheme. Even though there is no need for perfect enforcement
for the fuzzy RD-design, some degree of enforcement must be present. Another condition is
12
      If individuals—even while having some influence—are unable to precisely manipulate the assignment
     variable, a consequence of this is that the variation in treatment near the threshold is randomized as
     though from a randomized experiment

that municipal revenues and municipal expenditure, at least those more related to increase
welfare perception13 , should also change at the cutoffs. Figure 5 provides a graphical
illustration of this situation when pool all thresholds together by normalizing population
size according to the distance of each municipality from the above or below threshold.
There are evident jumps for both items, which shows that municipalities that just crossed
a threshold do not collect more municipal taxes, even though they raise their expenditures.
These findings are in accordance with a common stylized fact that credit this behavior to
the guaranteed new influx of federal transfers.

        Table 2 estimates the first-stage and the reduced-form regressions of in-migration
and out-migration measures. We control for a third-order polynomial in population size,
as well as year and state dummies. Each column in the heading represents the dependent
variable (outcome) and each cell presents the estimate coefficients of theoretical transfers.
The row "Overall" estimates the effect across all thresholds (1-7). To explore some degree of
heterogeneity, the next rows focus on the pooled thresholds of 1-3, 4-7 and each threshold.
To obtain those estimates we interacted equations (2) and (3) with a full set of dummies
ranging from the midpoint below to the midpoint above every FPM threshold, as portrayed
by Brollo et al. (2013).
        Column (1) reports the estimated first-stage coefficient of theoretical on actual
transfers. As pointed before, there must be some level of enforcement and the highly
significant estimates, most of them near to 114 , show that enforcement isn’t perfect, but
rather strong. The remaining columns report the reduced form effects of theoretical FPM
transfers on migration outcomes, which are, in-migration and out-migration for total
individuals, highly educated individuals, and vulnerable individuals. Overall effect points
to a reduction in the number of migrants who enter a given municipality based on an
increase of theoretical transfers. Our estimates seem to show that any increase in local
revenues aren’t spent on services and public goods that individuals could notice, which
could be due to the fact pointed by Gadenne (2017) that the type of revenue matters
when municipal governments decide on how to spend any revenue increase. On the other
hand, out-migration estimates show that individuals seem to leave their municipalities
when facing exogenous increases on theoretical FPM transfers and that is especially more
relevant for high educated individuals than for poor individuals, which seem to display

capable of better track how public funds are spent and, in case of a transfer increase,
which was not spent to boost welfare, might decide to leave a given city.

  Notes: Reduced-forms effects of theoretical FPM transfers and migration measures. Each cell reports the estimated
 coefficient of theoretical FPM transfers - controlling for a third-order polynomial in normalized population size, year
 dummies, and state dummies. The coefficient of the "Overall" are obtained with all thresholds; the heterogeneity coeffi-
 cients in other rows are obtained interacting our regressions with a set of population-interval dummies. Theoretical and
 Actual transfers are expressed in R$1000000 at 2010 prices. We use the years 2000 and 2010 and we cluster errors at the
 municipality level. Specifications (2)-(3) report estimates for total individuals, (4)-(5) highly educated individuals and
 (6)-(7) poor individuals (R$250 or less/month). *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1



       In-migration and out-migration for total individuals seem to be more relevant in
the lower thresholds, even though out-migration is also significant for most of the sample.
The general behavior for highly educated individuals is that increases in theoretical
transfers are related to increases in both measures, particularly when we evaluate each
threshold, which means that municipalities are attracting new people, but at the same
time evasion is increasing. This pattern doesn’t hold for thresholds 1-3, where it seems that
the new revenue decrease the number of out-migrants. When we look for more vulnerable
individuals, the behavior is different, since they seem to not leave and also not enter a
new municipality with a higher share of federal transfers in its budget. This pattern seems
rather conflicting, but it shows that poor individuals tend to stay where they currently
are, probably due to the increase of cash transfers programs in Brazil, such as the Bolsa
Família program, which is a national program to help poor individuals that match its
requirements.

                   educated individuals (middle) and vulnerable individuals (bottom).


       Both results are interesting in different ways because they reveal that increases in
revenues could encourage mobility for highly educated individuals and, at the same time,
might not influence any locational decision by poor individuals, which could happen due
to a series of reasons: 1) The minimum monetary cost required to leave is greater than
what a given individual is capable to afford, meaning that poor individuals do not migrate
because they do not have the monetary resources to do it. 2) As said before, the increase
in cash transfer programs probably also increased the cost to leave a given municipality,
since now that person will benefit from the program in any city, meaning that there are
fewer reasons to migrate in search of welfare improvement related to fiscal expenditure
and 3) some sort of "myopia effect" which could be translated into the inability to perceive
where and how any extra revenue is spent, so that if there is any improvement in welfare,
individuals can’t track it.

outcomes15 . We pooled the seven thresholds together by normalizing population, built
symmetric intervals around each threshold and averaged over 250-inhabitants bins. The
central line is a spline third-order polynomial in population size and lateral lines are the 95
percent confidence interval. Overall, out-migration and in-migration plots display relevant
discontinuities at zero.

         Notes: Effects of FPM transfers on migration measures. Each cell represents the estimated coefficient

        the dependent variable corresponding to each column heading. Theoretical and Actual transfers are
        expressed in R$1000000 at 2010 prices. We use the years 2000 and 2010 and we cluster errors at the
        municipality level. Specifications (1)-(2) report estimates for total individuals, (3)-(4) highly educated

        Table 3 estimates the baseline IV regressions indicated in equation (4) where
theoretical transfers are used as instruments for actual transfers. Again we control for a
third-order polynomial in population size, year and state dummies. Point estimates seem
higher than first-stage coefficients and out-migration also seems less relevant, since their
statistical significance drops a lot for column (4). Estimates for total individuals who
in-migrate displays a negative impact of actual transfers throughout all thresholds and
this effect seems to be consistent for almost all combinations of thresholds tested. For the
Overall effect, an increase of R$1 million causes in-migration to be reduced to about 165
people, which translates to a decrease of 5.1 percent in in-migration. At the same time, an
increase of R$1 million causes out-migration to increase in about 53 individuals, or 2.1
percent.
       Those results are in line with the first stage estimates and seem to show that
revenue increases from federal transfers do not attract people, on the contrary, it seems to
expel current residents, which might indicate that not only individuals do not perceive
any welfare improvement, but also seem to believe that this new revenue might not be
spent on any type of welfare increasing service at all, meaning that other factors, such as
corruption could be important to understand this behavior.

       The in-migration of poor individuals seem to replicate the first-stage signs, contrary
to out-migration outcomes, which show similar behavior to the other groups, that is
increases in federal transfers causing increases out-migration measures. Lower thresholds,
when statistically significant, do not reinforce the non-migration behavior by those in-
dividuals, since in-migration seems to decrease while out-migration seems to increase.
Out-migration for highly educated individuals is only significant for the overall effect and
higher thresholds, even though estimates are very low.

 Notes: Local Effects of FPM transfers on migration measures. Overall (2.5%) restrict the estimation with a bandwidth
of 2.5% around of the normalized population cutoff. Overall (5%) restrict the estimation with a bandwidth of 5% around
of the normalized population cutoff. Each cell represents the estimated coefficient of actual FPM transfers (instrumented
with theoretical FPM transfers) - controlling for a third-order polynomial in normalized population size, year dummies,
and state dummies - in a regression where the dependent variable corresponding to each column heading. Theoretical
and Actual transfers are expressed in R$1000000 at 2010 prices. We use the years 2000 and 2010 and we cluster errors at
the municipality level. Specifications (2)-(3) report estimates for total individuals, (4)-(5) highly educated individuals
and (6)-(7) poor individuals (R$250 or less/month). *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1



        Table 4 presents two variants of the Overall effect previously calculated, which
restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the seven cutoffs using two bandwidths (2.5%
and 5%). Estimates seem very similar to the previous estimation, but slightly higher,
indicating that results are locally relevant.
       On the role, results pointed to a higher effect of actual transfers over in-migration
than out-migration. As it seems, municipalities up to 50940 inhabitants that are granted
with more transfers do not use them in a way that the average individuals are capable to
notice any welfare improvement and, for that reason, they are compelled to leave their
current city. Welfare migration does not find support for our results.


Conclusion
        Welfare migration theory provides several insights about how individuals would
behave when facing adversities in their home regions. It is a common strategy to look for
better opportunities and better conditions to live, however, migratory flows have intensified
in recent years, becoming a major concern for public policy. To shed some light on this
topic, we used a fiscal rule in Brazil that provided exogenous variation to identify the
impact of an increase in federal grants over migration measures. We found little support
for welfare migration in Brazil since individuals seem to not be able to correctly evaluate
how this revenue increase is spent.
       Our empirical strategy follows a growing literature over Regression discontinuities
with the FPM law. Our contribution to this literature is to explore its particularities to

                                                              15
evaluate migration measures, more specifically, welfare migration outcomes. Also, to our
knowledge, this is the first paper that attempted to estimate the causal impacts of FPM
transfers with migration data from the Brazilian census. Mata (2015) estimated his results
using data from population growth and housing market for São Paulo state only. Our
results come from municipalities in all states of Brazil.
        We do realize the need to better discuss how the migration and fiscal channel works,
therefore for the next steps we’ll explore some robustness checks and, at the same time,
make sure that our identification strategy is correct. We believe that addressing those
issues, our claim will be stronger, since we have to deal with the low external validity of a
regular RDD, even more, when a fuzzy setup was used.

 Notes: Reduced-forms effects of theoretical FPM transfers (RF) and IV estimates (IV) of
migration measures. Each cell reports the estimated coefficient of theoretical FPM transfers
- controlling for a third-order polynomial in normalized population size, year dummies,
and state dummies. The coefficient of the "Overall" are obtained with all thresholds; the
heterogeneity coefficients in other rows are obtained interacting our regressions with a set of
population-interval dummies. Theoretical and Actual transfers are expressed at 2010 prices.
We use the years 2000 and 2010 and we cluster errors at the municipality level. *** p<0.01,
** p<0.05, * p<0.1
