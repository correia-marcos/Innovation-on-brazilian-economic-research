             In this article we propose an instrumental variable to estimate the causal impact of
          municipal spending in primary school on the quality of schools, measured by infrastructure
          conditions, and on the teacher’s qualification. We use 2 Stages Least Squares regressions,
          where we regress the local education spending on local share of Municipalities Participation
          Fund (Fundo De Participação dos Municı́pios - FPM) in the first stage, and use the predicted
          value in the second stage. We use the law of FPM transfer according to population brackets,
          which generates an exogenous increase in primary education expenditures, which allows
          Regressions in Discontinuity Design (RDD) using samples of municipalities close to the
          thresholds. We found no significant impact of education spending on public schools.

1        Introduction
Brazil is one of the worst countries in international standard tests and it is a natural consensus
that the education quality is very bad and need to be improved. There are many doubts however
on the needing to increases resources to education, as there are many doubts on how the money

is spent. Many studies that try to measure the effects of increasing education spending on its
quality and on schools and teachers, but in general it is difficult to make a causal interpretation
from education spending impacts. The primary public education in Brazil is financed in various
ways. The vast majority of schools that level are held by municipalities, so that they are funded
through the budget of the municipalities, either through taxes and local taxes, or through
transfers from other federate entities, such as the Municipalities’ Participation Fund (FPM).
    We want to asses this important question of public spending accountability using a quasi-experiment
in a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), answering whether increasing education spending
improve the quality of education analyzing the supply side of education, that is, schools and
teachers’ conditions. The legal rule of distribution of the FPM provides a sudden variation
of the transfer at certain population distribution thresholds. We estimate the impact of this
change, considered exogenous in the vicinity of the thresholds, on the quality of education. We
guarantee the causal identification through the Regression Discontinuity Design - RDD.
    Betts (1996) analyze many empirical evidences for USA and does not find a consensus for
school spending on student learning. According to the author, this indicates that part of the
expenditures may not impact on teaching quality, as teachers and school employee’s wages,
because of the great power of the syndicates. Also, there is not a consensus in the literature
about the impacts of education spending on school quality. Menezes-Filho, N., Pazello, E. T.
(2004) find no significant impact of the primary education spending on learning in the fourth
and eighth grades of primary education, unless for cities with greatest scores in the fourth grade.
Rocha et al (2013) finds inefficiency in the education spending among Brazilian municipalities.
The authors estimate an waste of resources varying from 40,1% a 47,3% when they assume,
respectively, variable and constant return to scale.
    Litschig, S. (2008) uses RDD and the same population discontinuity to analyze the effects
of FPM on education in the years 1982-1985, when the rule was a bit different from the present.
From the 1980 and 1981 census, along with information on municipal finances, the author
estimated a positive effect on literacy rate and years of schooling. The author argues that greater
budgetary revenues could result in higher quality education by directly increasing spending in
education, but also through the spending externality in areas such as health, early childhood
education and transport - which may impact on the learning ability of students and therefore
on the final quality of education. Thus, the increase in transfers can impact on various social
areas social spending other than education, so it is not possible to identify the channel that
FPM impacts on education learning, measured by standardized tests.
    Many papers have found significant impacts of FPM on local education spending (Litschig,
2008; Castro and Regatieri, 2014; Castro et al, 2015, Arvate et al, 2015, Brollo et al, 2013).
Also Castro and Regatieri (2014a) use the FPM population discontinuities and find an impact
of FPM on spending in education functions, health, urban planning and transport between 2005
and 2011. The conclusion is that the FPM generates strong impact on budgetary expenditure of
municipalities with up to 30,000 inhabitants, especially in the education function and sub-function
primary school. After education, the role that more has increased spending is health, especially
the Sub basic care. These spending on primary care in health can have a strong effect on families
and cognitive ability of children.
    Castro and Regatieri (2014b) show that there is a positive impact of per capita FPM on
municipal cognitive education, measured by the index of primary school quality, the IDEB
(Índice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica, in Portuguese) - composed by the municipal
schools pass rate and the students’ score in a proficiency exam. There is a strong effect on
the approval rate, especially in the second grade, which was the former first until 2008. The
authors could not identify to what extent the quality of education, according to standardized
tests and pass rates, is due to increased spending on education, or other functions of municipal
expenditures. Cognitive ability depends on factors associated with students’ families and schools.
Through health spending, for example, the government can directly improve the living conditions


                                               2
of students, which may have an impact on learning. Transport costs can reduce the cost of
going to school and reduce evasion. On the other hand, spending on education can improve the
infrastructure conditions and teachers of public schools, improving the quality of teaching.
    We use the fact that many authors have found a significant impact of FPM on education
spending in a first stage regression, and we use the fitted values in a second stage to measure the
impacts on school infrastructure and teachers conditions. In this way, we solve the identification
issue in the literature that looks for measuring the impacts of education spending. Also, we try to
answer if education spending is one of the factors that is driving the FPM impacts on education,
which may occur due to education public goods and teachers qualification and motivation. If
education spending is not impacting on school resources or teachers quality, there is no reason to
believe that education spending impacts on education quality, measured by test score or passing
rates.


2    Dados
We use data from local expenditures and FPM share of municipalities with up to 30,000
inhabitants in the years 2007, 2008 and 2009, released by the Treasury Secretariat of federal
government from the city hall declarations. The values in reais were update to january, 2014,
using the official inflation index (Índice de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo - IPCA).
    Information about schools conditions and teachers teaching municipal public was collected
from the school census survey conducted annually by the Ministry of Education in all public
schools in the country. We collect variables on physical characteristics of schools, those relating
to school infrastructure, such as the presence of library, laboratories, gym, and access to the
sewage, water, internet and light systems. It is also possible to know if the classes take place in
school own building, as well as information on the teaching staff of the school, as the number
of teachers and the proportion of those who attended higher education, bachelor’s or master’s
degree. We then calculate the mean values of these variables by all cities with less than 30,000
inhabitants.
    Figure 1 shows the evolution of some items of municipal budget spending over municipalities
with different populations. The curves were estimated by a local polynomial regression using
per capita values:

    [Figure 1 ]

    Figure 2 shows the distribution of the estimated number of pupils per teacher according
to the municipality’s population. Smaller municipalities have classrooms with fewer students
and fewer students for each teacher, but the variation among cities are not greater than 30%.
Municipalities with about 5,000 inhabitants have about 6 students per teacher on average, while
in municipalities with 30,000 inhabitants are almost 8 students per teacher.

    [Figure 2 ]

    Figure 3 shows the distribution of variables about primary elementary school schools and
teachers’ conditions. We analyzed the proportion of schools that have sewage, water supply,
garbage collection, internet, libraries, sport courts, computer labs, as well as the proportion
of teachers who attended undergraduate and higher education. Most schools operate in own
buildings schools, as well as have some sewer collection system, but less than 30% have computer
labs and less than 40% of these labs has Internet access. The figure shows little variation, on
average, in the quality of schools infrastructure and teachers condition in municipalities with up
to 30,000 inhabitants.

3    Empirical strategy
Our identification methodology relies heavily on the literature that uses RDD to estimate FPM
impacts, like Listchig (2012), Brollo (2013), Arvate et al (2015) and Castro et al (2015). The
main difference is that these authors estimate the impacts of per capita FPM due to the
theoretical FPM, the value that should be transferred strictly according to the law. This is
important because the FPM values are declared by the mayors, and so the first stage regression
is important to avoid error declaration bias. In the second stage, the literature estimate FPM
fitted values on education outcomes (Liscthig, 2008), education public goods (Gadenne, 2012)
corruption (Brollo, 2013), local budget expenditures (Arvate, 2015) and neighboring cities
expenditures (Castro et al, 2015).
    Our contribution is to use the local education spending as the dependent variable in the first
stage, using theoretical FPM as instrument, and we take the fitted values in the second stage. So,
we can estimate the direct effect of education spending on education public goods, measured by
schools resources and teachers qualification, that is, we estimate the effect of education spending
on public education quality, measured in the supply side of education achievement.
    The estimation relies on the exogenous FPM population thresholds. RDD estimates relies
on the limit distribution of potential variables near the thresholds - we consider that all relevant
variables follow continuous distribution in the vicinity of the thresholds, except the per capita
transferred FPM. In this way, we expect that any discontinuous variation in the dependent
variable in this regions should be caused by FPM variation. The manipulation possibilities
are very reduced, as FPM distribution is done automatically monthly, according to the local
population estimates released by IBGE. A careful explanation of the hypothesis validity for
RDD estimates in the case of FPM impacts can be find in Castro et al (2015).
    The population brackets are not the only rule for FPM distribution. It depends also on the
total amount destined to FPM in Brazil, which is 23,5% do Imposto de Renda e do Imposto sobre
Produtos Industrializados arrecados pela União, the state coefficient, tabulated by law, and the
Financial Reducer when it is applied. This last formula was created in Complementary Law n 91,
in 2007, and was applied until 2007 to a share of municipalities that lost population in the 90’s.
For this cities, previous year population coefficient, based on IBGE estimates, was progressively
implemented, and the amount that was transferred was reduced until its convergence to the
annual estimates.
    We calculate the total FPM amount that should be transferred to municipalities strictly
according to the law, which we call theoretical FPM. We use a 2 Stage Least Square 2SLS)
Regression to correct in the first stage the declared FPM error bias, using theoretical in place of
declared, and explore the exogenous FPM variation near the thresholds. As explained in Angrist
and Lavy (1999), RDD can be consistently generated using 2SLS.
    We can write the first stage regression as fitting the equation:

    Sit = β0 + β1 F P M theoreticalit + β2 popit + β3 pop2it + vit

    In which it is the city i spending in primary education in year t and F P M theoreticalit is
the theoretical FPM that have been transferred. Local population and its quadratic term are
added as control. In the second stage we estimate the impacts of S ∗ , the education spending
fitted values in the first stage, on the education resources, Qit , fitting the regression:
    Qit = α0 + τ Sit∗ + α1 popit + +α2 pop2it +it +uit

    The regressions are made using data of municipalities with 500 inhabitants to more and less


                                                   4
than the FPM populations. We also explore the panel of cities along the years to control for
Fixed Effect on the city level, that is, we control for all variables that could bias the results and
are invariant on time (Wooldrigde, 2002). We also present estimate of Fixed Effec and 2SLS
for all the data, following Angrist and Lavy (1999) approach. RDD is a local linear regression,
so the estimated effects have strong internal validity to explain the results near the thresholds,
but it is hard to extrapolate the results to all the data. Nevertheless, we use the 4 different
population thresholds in cities with less than 30,000 inhabitants to analyze the impact variation
to cities with different populations sizes.


4        RDD hypothesis verification
The main hypothesis for RDD is that the treatment (per capita FPM) varies exousgenouly near
the forcing variable thresholds. Figure 1 shows the jumps in transferred FPM at the population
thresholds, creating ”steps” in FPM distribution, which shows that the forcing variable has the
desired effect1 .

        [Figure 4]


    In figure 5, we estimate the city per capita FPM on the left and on the right separately,
using local polynomial regression, and we see strong impacts of population rule in the regions
near the thresholds. The effects are not the same at all the thresholds and are not binary, as
population brackets are not the only rule for FPM distribution - as the state and total national
amount.

        [Figure 5]



5        Results
5.1        FPM impacts on education spending
We present in Table 1 the RDD estimates of per capita FPM on education spending, separate by
spending on childhood, primary, high school, professional and graduate education. The impacts
are more close to Castro e Regatieri (2014a), but similar impacts were found in Arvate et al
(2015) and Castro et al (2015). These authors find an overall significant impact on local budget
spending, specially on education and health.
    Column 1 of Table 1 shows a significant impact of FPM on education spending of at least
80 cents to each 1 real transferred This impact is 1.4 real at threshold 4. Most of this extra
spending is done on primary education, which varies from 0.6 to 1.06 reais, followed by childhood
education, 0.10 to 0.18 reais.

        [Table 1]

    We estimate next the impacts of primary education on schools and teachers conditions, using
the FPM as instrument. The correlations between per capita FPM and primary education are
also strong when we use OLS regressions. All the spending in primary schools, investment or
current spending, such teachers’ wages, are computed as primary education spending, so any
shock in schools and teachers conditions near the FPM population thresholds must be due the
extra primary education and the extra FPM.
    1
        We exclude cities that receive extreme values of per capita FPM, that is, more than 2,000 reais.


                                                           5
    In this way, we want to analyze if the education spending increases the quality of teaching
offered by the public system. Castro e Regatieri (2014b) find significant impacts of FPM on
cognitive abilities measured by a standardized test, the IDEB, but it is not clear if the impacts are
due to education spending. Health expenditures, for example, can spillover in education while
improving students’ health conditions and learning capacity. If we find impacts of education
spending on school conditions should be a sign that the education spending is an important
channel in which FPM affects education, whereas if we find no impact should be a sign that
another kinds of spending, such as health, must be driving the measured education variation.

5.2   Primary education impacts on schools resources in cities with up to
      30,000 inhabitants
Table 2 presents OLS estimates using all the cities with up to 30,000 inhabitants. We use the
logarithm of the primary education spending in each city to measure the impact of schools
and teachers conditions. The results do not have the expected signal in general. In the first
group of regressions, spending on primary education is associated with lower coverage of sewage
systems, electricity and garbage collection in the public network schools. In addition, the
middle part shows that there seems to be a decrease in the percentage of schools with sports
facilities, libraries, televisions, computers, internet and bathrooms in the inner area of the school.
Finally, there seems to be increase in the number of students per teacher and a fall of teachers’
qualification level. One hypothesis is that there is a negative correlation between per capita
spending on education and municipality size, and larger municipalities have better conditions
and scale to invest in schools.

   [Table 2]

    Table 3 shows the effects of spending on primary education on the quality of schools using
fixed effects regressions. Thus, we estimate the average change of the schools’ characteristics
from one year to another due to variations in education spending in the period. The method
eliminates variables that can lead to a bias in the estimation and which are fixed in the period
considered, such as geographical conditions and population size (Wooldrigde, 2002).
    Most impacts are not significant or have a small magnitude, but generally have the expected
signal. The effect on the physical characteristics of schools are small or non-existent, but there
is a significant effect on education spending on the number of students per teacher: a reduction
of almost 3 students for each 10% increase in education spending.

   [Table 3]

    The latest specification using all population in smaller municipalities than 30 thousand
inhabitants will be done using instrumental variables - we consider spending on education
induced by transferring funds via FPM. The regression will be done by Minimum Squares 2
Stages (2SLS), and the first stage corresponds to the estimates of expenditure in higher education
due to the theoretical rule of distribution of the FPM.
    Table 4 shows that the overall results are significant and have the expected signs. The
increase of 1% in spending on primary education increase by 5 % the proportion of the network
that provides power in 20% to 87% the proportion of schools that collect sewage and garbage
respectively. There is also an increase of 68%, 66 % to 74% in proportion to network computer
labs, sports facilities and libraries.

5.3    Primary education RDD impacts on public schools and teachers’ characteristics
The following Tables 5-8 show the 2SLS estimated effect of primary education spending on the
school and teachers’ characteristics for each of the population thresholds. The instrument is the
theoretical FPM in the 500 inhabitants windows around the thresholds2 . We use the percentage
of schools with each of the resources as dependent variable, or the percentage of teachers with
each of the qualification level, as dependent variables, and we use the logarithm of primary
education spending as independent variable in the second stage. we also make regressions using
the number of students per teacher and the number of computers as dependent variable.
    We present the results for thresholds 1 to 4 in the Tables 5-8, respectively. For all the
thresholds, there are no impacts of primary education spending on teachers’ qualification and
on the schools of this level. The results are quite different of those estimated by OLS and FE
with all the data. These robust estimates do not indicate effects of public education spending
on school resources, although the literature points to FPM impacts on education quality. One
explanation is that other kind of expenditures is driving the FPM effect, as health expenditures.
It is disturbing that the increase in education spending is not being spent on school resources
and teachers qualification, which could increase the teaching quality and is a good indicative,
although preliminary, that increase education spending do not impact on education quality.

6     Conclusions
We estimate the impacts of primary education spending on schools’s structures and teachers’
qualification of this level. Many papers make this estimation for Brazil, but most of them lack
on causal identification issues. We use the FPM transference discontinuities as instrument for
exogenous shocks on local revenue and spending on education. We want to now if more money
to education reverts on better teaching conditions in the public education system.
    The results are not conclusive when we use all the municipalities with less than 30,000
inhabitants in OLS. In some cases the estimates have the opposite signals, because per capita
FPM and education spending is negative correlated with local population, and smaller cities
have worst schools and teachers’ conditions. When we use FE and 2SLS there is in general a
positive impact of education spending on schools’ conditions.
    The robust estimates uses the FPM population rule that generates discontinuities in the
transfers as the principal identification hypothesis for causal inference. In the cities with
population near the thresholds, the impacts of education spending on public teaching quality,
measured by schools’ structure and teachers’ qualification, are not significant for all the thresholds
and variables.
    A particular explanation that should be explored latter is that education spending, even
when increased, is wasted on others ways that to not improve education teaching. That is
reasonable because small cities have worst structure conditions and it is hard to attract more
qualified teachers to them. The competition between schools and teachers are very restricted
   2
     We use alternative estimation windows with 250 and 1,000 inhabitants around the thresholds, but the results
are not substantially different.
